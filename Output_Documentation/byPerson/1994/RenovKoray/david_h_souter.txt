justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
why
don't
we
let
the
statute
be
the
criterion
across
the
board,
and
mr.
estrada
says
the
easiest
way
to
do
that
is
to
identify
the
state
official
who
customarily
has
the
legal
custody
of
those
who
are
committed
to
jails
and
prisons,
and
if,
during
the
time
in
question,
the
individual
is
committed
to
that
official's
custody,
it's
detention,
if
not
to
that
custody,
it's
not
detention.
if
the
statutory
reference
is
good
for
the
argument
or
the
answer
that
you're
making
to
the
chief,
why
isn't
it
equally
good
as
a
general
criteria?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
construe
it
the
way
mr.
estrada
argues,
it
probably
is
pretty
clear.
there
are
going
to
be
close
cases
on
either
side
of
the
line
in
which
one
could
argue
it
doesn't
seem
quite
fair
to
treat
this
person
with...
give
this
person
credit
and
that
person
not,
but
it's
clear.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
estrada
i
thought
answered
the
question
saying
each
state
identifies
some
official
as
the
one
to
have
custody
of
those
who
are
denied
bail.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
that
we
want
to
consider
that
position.
why
would
that
be
difficult
to
apply?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
you're
rejecting
the
hypoth...
i
mean,
you're
rejecting
the
position.
you're
saying,
well,
the
government
used
to
say
it
had
to
be
the
attorney
general,
and
now
he's
saying
it
could
be
a
state
official.
you're
saying
there's
an
inconsistency
there.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
think
there
is,
but
let's
assume
the
government's
position
is
that
when
we
are
talking
about
an
issue
of
state
"custody"
the
official
we
look
to
is
the
state
official.
as
long
as
we
can
identify
that
official
as
the
one
customarily
with
custody
of
those
who
are
denied
bail
under
the
state
system,
why
is
that
difficult
to
administer,
and
i
think
your
answer
is,
it
really
isn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
can
result
in
a
situation
in
which
there
are
going
to
be
two
cases
in
which
the
conditions
seem
to
be
about
the
same
but
one
is
on
one
side
of
the
line
and
one
is
on
the
other.
that's
your
argument,
and
i
agree
with
you;
that's
a
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
don't
we
also
have
to
accept
the
fact
that
even
under
your
own
argument,
and
under
any
argument
i
can
imagine
you
making,
there
isn't
going
to
be
complete
fairness
in
sentencing.
you
may
very
well
have
a
halfway
house
confinement
or
halfway
house
assignment,
i
guess
i
will
say,
before
sentencing
which
isn't
going
to
give
you
any
credit,
and
yet
at
the
end
of
a
sentence
being
served,
there
may
very
well
be
assignment
to
a
halfway
house
during
a
work
release
period,
credit
is
going
to
be
granted.
there's...
you
know,
that's
unfair,
too.
there's
some
unfairness,
i
suppose,
no
matter
how
we
try
to
make
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
i
mean,
the
actual
conditions
are
exactly
the
same
in
each
case.
