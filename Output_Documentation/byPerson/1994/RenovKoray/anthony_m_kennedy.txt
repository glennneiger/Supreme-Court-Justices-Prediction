justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
was
going
to
ask,
mr.
estrada,
under
at
least
the
federal
system,
is
it
open
to
the
prisoner
to
say
that
he
wants
to
start
serving
his
time
immediately
in
a
detention
facility?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
court
said,
we
don't
have
room
for
you
in
the
jail,
we're
going
to
put
you
in
a
concrete
house
at
14th
street,
where
you're
not
under
the
supervision
of
correctional
officials,
until
we
have
room
for
you.
could
he--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--could
he
object
to
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
think
in
a
case,
i
assume
it
would
be
where
there's
a
short
sentence,
that
if
the
prisoner
wants
to
get
it
over
with,
he
can
tell
the
judge,
i
want
to
begin
serving
my
time
now,
and
the
judge
is
bound
by
that?
