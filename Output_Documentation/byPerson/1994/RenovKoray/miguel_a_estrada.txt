mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
3585
of
title
18
instructs
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
calculate
a
defendant's
sentence
of
imprisonment
in
two
related
steps.
under
subsection
(a),
the
bureau
must
first
determine
when
the
sentence
began,
which
usually
is
when
the
defendant
is
received
for
transportation
to
the
facility
where
he
is
to
serve
it.
subsection
(b)
of
the
statute
deals
with
the
issue
of
credit
for
prior
custody
before
the
sentence
began,
and
it
generally
requires
that
a
defendant
receive
credit
for
any
time
he
has
spent
"in
official
detention".
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
bureau
is
correct
in
denying
sentence
credit
under
subsection
(b)
to
defendants
who
are
released
on
bail
within
the
meaning
of
the
bail
reform
act
of
1984.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
am
told,
though
i
don't
think
it
is
in
the
record,
that
he
is--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--he
is
on
bail
in...
living
in
the
state
of
new
york,
i
believe,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
bail
status.
after
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
judgment
i
think
in
the
last
footnote
of
the
court's
opinion
instructed
the
district
court
to
grant
bail
to
the
defendant
pending
any
hearing
on
the
remand
on
just
how
jail-like
the
conditions
of
incarceration
or
of
bail
were.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
he
would--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
he
would.
yes,
he
would.
the
supposition
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
because
the
sentence
that
remained
was
so
short,
and
practically
most
of
it
was
subject
to
the
dispute
of
credit,
that
in
order
not
to
render
the
case
moot
pending
the
hearing
that
the
court
ordered,
the
defendant
should
be
granted
bail,
and
that's
what
the
district
court
did
on
remand,
and
if
we
manage
to
persuade
the
court
to
our
view
of
the
statute
in
this
case,
the
result
will
be
that
he
will
have
to
surrender
for
custody
and
serve
the
remainder
of
the
sentence.
the
third
circuit
in
this
case
rejected
the
bureau's
interpretation
and
held
that
the
words
"official
detention"
must
be
read
more
broadly
than
the
bureau
does
in
order
to
include
a
court
order
that
releases
a
defendant
in
bail
but
subject
to
a
condition
that
he
remains
in
a
privately
run
halfway
house
under
the
conditions
that
the
court
termed
"jail-like",
and
our
argument
in
this
court
has
three
principal
points
as
to
why
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong.
first,
that
the
context
of
the
statutory
language
indicates
that
congress
used
the
word
(b).
the
second
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
today
is
that
congress
used
the
words
1984,
and
that
it
was
by
then
settled
in
the
courts
of
appeals
under
the
antecedent
statute
that
dealt
with
credit
that
somebody
who
was
released
on
bail
would
not
be
eligible
for
credit
toward
a
sentence
of
imprisonment,
and
the
third
point
is
that
if...
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
that
it
is
possible
to
read
the
statute
more
broadly,
the
agency
was
not
required
to
do
so,
and
its
view
is
reasonable,
so
it
is
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
the
contention
is
that
it
did.
our
view
is
they
did
not...
that
it
did
not.
there
was
a
general
rule
that
would
have
denied
a
defendant
in
the
position
of
respondent
credit
even
under
the
old
policy
statement,
and
in
fact
that
general
rule
was
cited
by
the
warden
when
it
turned
down
the
first
request
by
the
inmate
in
this
case.
there
was
an
exception
that
came
out
of
a
case
called
waldorf,
as
we
discuss
in
our
brief,
that
was
basically
to
the
effect
that
if
the
defendant
was
ordered
to
actually
be
in
a
jail
as
a
condition
of
bail
under
the
custody
of
prison
officials,
credit
would
be
granted
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
the
use...
the
policy
actually
used
not
the
word
"conditions"
but
"jail-like
facilities",
and
i
am
told
by
the
bureau
that
it
was
never
interpreted
in
the
way
that
the
third
circuit
thought
it
might
be
interpreted.
i
haven't
heard
respondent
offer
an
example
as
to
any
other
time
in
which
it
was
interpreted
that
broadly
and,
in
fact,
if
it
were,
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
general
thrust
of
the
general
rule,
because
if
it
were
as
broad
as
the
court
of
appeals
thought,
it
would
swallow
the
entire
rule
that
said
that
this
class
of
people
didn't
get
credit,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--the
facts
that
gave
rise
to
the
narrow
exception,
justice
ginsburg,
were
that
he
was
required
to
go
back
to
the
jail
during
the
nights
and
weekends,
i
believe.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
correct.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
right,
because
the
statute
splits
up
the
world
into
not
the...
based
on
the
time
when
the
sentence
starts,
not
when
the
sentence
is
imposed,
and
under
subsection
(a),
the
sentence
starts
when
usually
he
shows
up
at
the
jail
where
he
is
to
serve
that
sentence.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--and
under
our
view,
none
of
that
is
warranting
of
credit
under
the
statute.
if
i
could
go
back
to
make
one
final
point
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
the
1979
program
statement
that
does
contain
the
exception
was
republished
in
1993
virtually
in
identical
form,
except
that
the
1993
version
does
not
state
that
exception.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
there
is
no
record
as
to
why,
when
the
bureau
republished
the
1993
version,
it
took
out
the
old
waldorf
exception.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
not
as
to
these
matters.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
the
same
deference
that
you
would
owe
to
any
other
agency's
reasonable
interpretation
of
a
statute
that
you
have
found
it
is
charged
with
administering.
once
you
have
held
under
wilson,
in
our
view,
that
this
statute
was
something
that
congress
envisioned
would
be
administered
by
the
bureau
within
the
narrow
confines
of
what
it
is,
they
would
get,
in
effect,
the
delegated
implicit
authority
to
fill
out
the
details
as
to
how
better
to
make
the
statute
work.
it
is
obviously
a
basic
premise
of
that
argument
that
the
court
in
wilson
found
that
congress
had
an
intent
to
delegate
to
the
bureau
these
sorts
of
computations.
obviously,
if
this
were
a
statute
the
administration
of
which
is
confined
solely
to
the
courts
like
any
other
criminal
statute,
that
is
not
an
argument
that
we
would
be
making
here,
but
once
the
court
ruled
in
wilson
that
there
was
to
some
extent
at
least
an
implicit
delegation
to
the
bureau
to
administer
this
statute,
in
our
view
they're
entitled
to
deference
on
their
reasonable
views
as
to
what
the
statutory
terms
mean.
of
course,
that
is
our
fallback
argument.
we
think
that
the
statute
is
best
read
in
the
way
that
we
have
argued.
that
is
to
say
that
the
words
1984
act.
in
the
case
of
block
v.
rutherford,
for
example,
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
the
court
dealt
with
the
constitutional
requirements
that
apply
to
a
state's
holding
pre-trial
detainees,
and
the
court
said
that
detainees,
by
definition,
are
people
who
have
not
made
bail.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--our
basic
contention
here,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the
word
1984
is
evidence
of
what
is
usually
understood--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
is
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word
looks
to
the
consequences
of
the
bail
decision,
not
to
the
label
that
the
state
attaches
to
it,
which
is
to
say--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--the
result
is
that
if
you
are
in
the
custody
of
state
prison
officials,
you're
entitled
to
credit,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
it
is
not.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
the
result
is
that
person
gets
no
credit,
because
if
the
person
is
not
in
that
house,
as
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
under
the
custody
and
under
the
control
of
state
prison
officials
who
may
take
him
out
without
going
to
the
court
to
ask
for
authority,
and
who
may
do
to
him
many
of
the
things
that
are
done
to
both
convicted
prisoners
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
think
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
and
the
answer
is
that
under
our
view
of
the
statute
the
word
"detention"
connotes...
the
word
"detention"
as
used
in
the
credit
statute
connotes
custody
by
state
prison
authorities,
the
old
bars
example,
and
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
state
court
calls
it,
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
prisoner
calls
it.
if
he
was--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--let
me
take
that
in
two
answers.
as
to
the
first
point,
the
answer
is,
we
don't
know,
because
all
of
the
records
from
the
original
case
in
baltimore
are
sealed,
so
what
was
actually
placed
on
the
record
is
not
in
front
of
the
court,
and
it
is
not
in
the
record
in
front
of
the
court.
nonetheless,
my
answer
to
that
is
that
by
the
time
this
happened
the
issue
of
whether
somebody
could
get
credit
for
time
spent
in
a
halfway
house
had
been
litigated
in
the
circuits,
the
bureau
had
a
policy,
both
of
those
things
had
clear
rules,
and
certainly
that
gives
better
notice
to
a
person
who
thinks
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
it
than
the
rule
that
the
third
circuit
came
up
in
this
case,
which
basically
says
that
if
it
later
should
turn
out
that
the
person
was
held
under
jail-type
conditions,
then
maybe,
depending
on
the
outcome
of
a
hearing,
he'll
get
credit.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
maybe
yes
and
maybe
no.
i
rather
suspect
that
the
county
jail,
where
he
was
in
the
first
place,
was
sufficiently
unpleasant
that
wouldn't
have
been--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
is
open
to
the
prisoner
to
waive
his
right
to
bail,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
making
the
notice
argument
that
justice
ginsburg
was
just
referring
to
in
effect
said
that.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--as
with
all...
well,
let
me
take
the
question
in
two
parts.
as
with
all
waivers
and
most
rights,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
take
it
if
there's
a
public
policy
reason
why
it
should
not.
as
to
all
matters
that
bear
on
what
may
later
follow
from
the
bail
determination,
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
under
the
bail
statute
there
is
a
right
to
appellate
review,
and
if
someone
is
dissatisfied
with
the
conditions
under
which
he
has
placed,
he
can
take
them
up
and
say
that,
for
example,
they
are
too
restrictive.
i--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no.
in
most
cases
i
think
the
judge
will
give
him
his
way.
i
don't
think
he
has
a
legally
enforceable
right
to
do
so,
and
if,
as
with
many
other
things
where
people
would
like
to
do
something
that
is
not
quite
compelled
by
law,
we
will
try
to
accommodate
him,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
legal
rule,
if
there
are
good
reasons
to
the
contrary,
why
he
must
have
his
way
in
that
respect.
if
i
could
go
back
to
the--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
but
let
me
explain
that
as
to
the
second
hypothetical,
the
legal
consequence
under
the
bail
statute
of
the
court
saying
bail
is
denied
is
that
he
must
be
confined
into
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general,
so
therefore
the
court
doesn't
really
have
the
authority
under
the
bail
statute,
i
don't
think,
to
sort
of
say,
bail
is
denied,
and
i'm
going--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--to
confine
you--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
i
don't
think
he
can
do
that.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
would
be
a--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that's
right,
justice
stevens,
and
it
is
not
our
view
that
the
statute
would--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--in
both
cases
there
is
detention
in
some
sense
of
the
english
word,
"detention".
only
in
the
latter
case
is
there
official
detention
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
in
essence,
yes,
but
let
me
make
two
points
in
response
to
that,
justice
stevens,
because
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
a
troubling
hypothetical.
the
first
one
is
that
congress
passes
a
statute
like
the
credit
statute
with
reference
to
classes
of
people.
it
is
not
a
question
as
to
how
congress
would
really
think
of
a
case
that
comes
close
to
a
line
in
some
sense,
but
that
wasn't
the
class
that
congress
didn't
think
of
favoring
when
it
conceived
of
the
broad
class
at
the
outset.
the
second
point
is
that,
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
being
in
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general,
even
if
she
chooses
to
put
you
in
a
halfway
house
for
some
period
of
time,
is
quite
different
from
being
in
the
custody
of
a
private
person.
it
has
many
legal
consequences,
including
what
the
attorney
general--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes.
i
don't...
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
court
found
that
the
defendant
should
be
detained,
which
is
a
finding
that
under
the
bail
law
may
only
be
made
after
finding
that
the
person
is
a
risk
of
flight
or
a
danger
to
the
community,
it
would
be
fairly
irresponsible
for
the
attorney
general
or
anyone
acting
for
her--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--maybe.
i
think
that
in
most
cases
of
the
type
that
you
hypothesize,
justice
stevens,
it
would
be
fairly
irresponsible
for
the
attorney
general
to
take
somebody
who
has
been
found
to
be
a
danger
to
the
community
and
put
him
or
her
in
any
place
other
than
a
secure
environment.
but
even
as
to
cases
that
can
be
hypothesized,
our
basic
point
continues
to
be
the
same,
that
the
statute
deals
with
categories
of
what
readily
came
to
congress'
mind
as
the
classes
most
likely
to
be
implicated
by
rulings
of
this
type.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
once
again,
let
me
make
the
first
answer
to
that
question
by
emphasizing
the
answer
that
i
gave
to
justice
breyer,
which
is
that
it
is
not
our
contention
that
the
credit
statute
incorporates
in
high
verba
the
definitions
of
the
bail
reform
act.
it
is
that
in
the
context
of
a
statute
of
this
type,
the
word
"detention"
has
a
plain
meaning
that
connotes
a
denial
of
bail,
and
that
an
example
of
that
is
the
bail
reform
act.
even
if
it
were
our
contention
that
the
statute
simply
incorporates
the
related
statutes
so
that
we
were
faced
with
the
notion
of
this
being
limited
only
to
the
attorney
general,
the
bureau
has
taken
the
view
that
it
can
extend
that
a
little
bit
based
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
'66
act
which
we
mentioned
in
our
reply
brief,
and
on
the
settled
practice,
before
the
statute
took
its
current
form
in
1984,
which
congress
chose
not
to
disturb.
now,
i
understand
that
if
one
gets
to
that
level
of
the
analysis,
it
is
possible
to
quibble
with
whether
the
bureau
is
right
in
taking
those
two
matters
to
in
effect
impeach
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
but
i
would
argue
to
you,
justice
o'connor,
that
if
that's
true,
the
remedy
is
to
tell
us,
do
not
give
credit
to
state
prisoners,
not
to
say
that
everything
else
goes,
and
we
think
that
within
all
of
the
normal
tools
of
statutory
construction,
we
have
a
fairly
coherent
view
of
the
statute
that
accounts
for
the
fairly
unique
nature
of
giving
credit
toward
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
that
the
other
side
simply
does
not
have.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
we
place
those
in
the
category
of
detention,
justice
stevens,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
bail
reform
act
uses
the
word
"detention"
not
only
to
refer
to
the
type
of--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
not
right,
justice
stevens,
for
the
following
reason.
the
judgment
to
set
bail
under
that
condition
is
a
judgment
that
the
safety
of
the
community
and
the
defendant
showing
up
will
not
be
assured
unless
the
bail
condition
is
met.
if
he
cannot
meet
the
condition,
the
attorney
general's
judgment
would
in
effect
put
us
in
the
same
place
as
the
earlier
hypothetical,
which
is,
the
judge
has
found
that
this
will
not
be
assured
in
the
absence
of
the
condition,
and
the
attorney
general
is
nonetheless
disregarding
that
judgment
and
setting
the
person
free
anywhere.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
i
would
like--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
haven't,
justice
breyer.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
our
system
is
based
on
the
notion
that
most
of
the
states
have
an
authority
that
puts
people
in
jail
and
keeps
them
there,
and
therefore
that
is
the
authority
who,
if
they
had
custody
legally
over
the
defendant,
they
get
the
defendant
credit,
and
if
that
does
not
happen,
then
the
defendant
does
not
get
credit.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
could
reserve--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
emphasize
that
the
standard
that
was
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
being
urged
by
respondent
is
unworkable.
what
respondent
has
done
in
effect
is
to
ask
the
court
to
come
up
with
a
set
of
essentially
legislative
classifications
based
in
part
on
what
would
be
considered
probation
under
3563.
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
highlight,
as
we
did
in
our
reply
brief,
that
if
you
took
all
of
the
conditions
that
respondent
had
in
this
case
and
asked
what
those
would
be
called
if
it
were
a
sentence
under
the
federal
system,
the
answer
would
be
that
it
is
a
sentence
of
probation,
not
a
sentence
of
imprisonment,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
section
3563(b)(12),
which
identifies
what
happened
here
as
a
permissible
condition
of
probation.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
it
shows
as
one
of
our
statutory
arguments,
justice
scalia,
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
here
was
to
provide
credit
for
only
one
type
of
federal
sentence.
this
is
a
statute
that
deals
with
credit
only
for
one
of
the
many
possible
federal
sentences
that
may
be
imposed,
and
the
fact
that
if
we
took
everything
that
happened
here
and
asked
what
it
would
be
called
if
it
were
a
sentence,
and
the
answer
is
not
what
the
statute
gives
credit
for,
we
think
it's
a
very
powerful
textual
indication
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
case
for
which
credit
was
contemplated.
on
the
issue
of
lack
of
notice,
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
18
u.s.c.
3142(h),
which
is
part
of
the
bail
statute,
and
has
a
specific
list
of
matters
that
the
defendant
must
be
advised
of
when
he
is
granted
bail,
including
his
duties
under
their
bail
bond
and
the
absence
or
any
consequence
as
to
credit
is
not
one
of
them.
thank
you.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
is
not
one
of
them.
