mr.
estrada,
where
is
the
respondent
presently?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
he
in
custody?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
some
kind
of
supervised
release
status?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
be
the
effect
of
our
ruling
if
it
were
in
your
favor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
he
have
more
time
to
serve?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
bureau
of
prisons
have
a
different
interpretation
under
its
1979
program
statement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--was
there
any
statutory
basis
for
that
change,
or
was
it
just
a
decision
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
change
the
language?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
bureau
of
prisons
have
rulemaking
authority?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
what
deference
do
we
owe
to
the
bureau
of
prison's
interpretation,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
language
of
the
statute
do
you
rely
on
in
giving
credit
for
time
spent
in
state
custody?
there's
no
reference
there
to
the
attorney
general.
