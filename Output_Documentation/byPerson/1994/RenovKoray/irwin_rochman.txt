mr.
irwin
rochman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
following
up
on
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
and
asking
the
court
to
imagine
the
following.
let
us
assume
that
on
the
same
date
that
the
court
ordered
mr.
koray
confined
to
the
premises
of
the
halfway
house
under
a
release
on
conditions
order,
which
commits
him
to
the
custody
of
pretrial
services,
that
there
was
a
codefendant,
and
that
on
that
same
day
the
court
ordered
that
codefendant
detained
under
a
detention
order,
but
the
court
also
recommended
to
the
attorney
general
that
that
codefendant
be
placed
in
a
community
based
program
or
residence,
which
the
bureau
of
prisons
in
its
own
program
statement
suggests
the
court
may
do.
i'm
looking
particularly
at
the
petition
for
cert,
the
appendix,
at
page
46a.
it's
the
very
top
of
the
page.
let
us
assume
the
bureau
of
prisons
takes
that
recommendation
in
this
hypothetical
and
confines
the
codefendant
to
the
same
halfway
house
that
mr.
koray
was
confined
to,
and
let
us
assume
that
both
men,
they
may
be
dorm
mates,
they
may
be
roommates,
but
for
those
same
150
days
they
are
subject
to
the
same,
as
mr.
koray
alleges,
jail-type
rules
that
prevail
in
that
halfway
house.
according
to
the
interpretation
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
"official
detention"
this
anomalous
result
occurs.
mr.
irwin
rochman
that's
not...
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
irwin
rochman
i
think
he
could
have
withdrawn
the
request.
respectfully,
the
record
is
not
clear
that
the
request
was
made
by
him,
and
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that,
given
the
chronology
of
this
case,
that
is
not
at
all
clear.
mr.
koray
was
detained
under
a
detention
order
from
the
time
of
his
arrest
until
1
week
after
he
had
entered
a
plea
of
guilty.
at
the
time
the
order
confining
him
to
the
premises
of
the
halfway
house
was
entered,
he
had
already
entered
a
plea
of
guilty.
under
the
sentencing
guidelines
there
was
then
a
certainty
of
a
jail
sentence.
it
seems
to
me
highly
unlikely,
given
the
realities
of
the
situation,
that
a
defendant
simply
coming
forward
and
asking
for
some
kind
of
bail
release,
that
would
have
been
granted.
what
seems
to
me
at
least
equally
plausible
and
more
likely
is
that
the
court
may,
for
its
own
reasons,
have
wanted
to
place
him
in
a
halfway
house.
as
i
think
justice
kennedy
indicated,
there
may
have
been
overcrowding
at
the
regular
detention
facility,
and
the
court
may
have
decided
to
place
him
in
the
halfway
house
to
relieve
that
overcrowding.
mr.
irwin
rochman
that
is...
the
record
is
not
clear,
and
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that
a
chronology
of
events
makes
it
unlikely
that
he
requested
it
or
that
if
he
requested
it
he
got
what
he
wanted.
your
honor
asked
earlier
about
whether
or
not
mr.
koray
was
informed
as
to
the
consequences
of
his
being
confined
at
the
halfway
house
as
opposed
to
his
earlier
confinement
under
a
detention
order,
and
i
think
that
judge
sloviter
in
her
opinion
indicated
a
concern
about
the
unfairness
of
now
not
crediting
a
defendant
with
this
time
if
the
defendant
had
not
been
advised
at
the
time
of
the
order.
mr.
irwin
rochman
it's--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--it's
possible.
if
the
judge
decided
to
change
his
status
from
that
of
being
under
a
detention
order
to
a
release
on
conditions
order,
i
don't
know
that
he
had
a
choice.
the
only
argument
that
he
does
is
that
a
release
on
conditions
order,
what
is
contained
in
the
appendix
here,
requires,
or
at
least
has
a...
there
is
a
place
for
the
defendant
to
sign
indicating
his
consent
to
the
conditions
that
the
order
imposes,
and
in
fairness,
koray
did...
his
signature
does
appear.
mr.
irwin
rochman
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
irwin
rochman
to
continue--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--i
hope
i've
answered
your
question,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
irwin
rochman
to
continue
with
my
hypothetical,
the
anomalous
result
that
would
occur--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--he
signed...
there
is
a
portion
of
the
release
on
conditions
order
which
specifies
the
conditions
of
the
release.
in
this
case,
the
significant
condition
of
release
was
that
mr.
koray
was
"confined
to
the
premises
of
the
volunteers
of
america.
"
which
ran
a
halfway
house
in
baltimore,
maryland,
"and
may
not
leave
unless
accompanied
by
special
agent
dennis
bass.
"
those
are
the
exact
words
of
the
order.
mr.
irwin
rochman
it's
hard
to
imagine
it's
anything
but,
sir.
mr.
irwin
rochman
that
is
not
jail
type
confinement.
mr.
irwin
rochman
it
is
not
jail-type
confinement,
sir,
because
the
language
of
the
statute
now
is
"official
detention".
the
language
of
the
statute,
it's
the
predecessor
statute
which
was
in
effect
from
1960
to
1987,
was
"in
custody".
mr.
irwin
rochman
i...
i'm
sorry.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no,
that
would
not
be
jail-like,
as
i
said.
mr.
irwin
rochman
it
becomes--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--correct.
mr.
irwin
rochman
the
reason
i
was
beginning
to
discuss
the
language
of
the
statute
and
its
history
was
in
an
attempt
to
be
responsive
to
your
question.
the
answer
is
that
jail-type
confinement
means
equivalent
to
incarceration.
that
is
the
way
the
courts
have
interpreted
the
word--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--sorry?
mr.
irwin
rochman
when
the
person
is
totally
confined,
or
where
there
are
serious
restrictions
on
the
person's
liberty
and
the
facility--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--it
could
be,
but
it
is
not
incarceration.
mr.
irwin
rochman
the
standard
of
the
criterion
that
we're
looking
for
is
one
of
jail-type
confinement.
mr.
irwin
rochman
i'm
attempting
to
answer.
if
there
is
a
confinement
to
a
private
home,
certainly
that's
a
serious
restriction
on
liberty,
a
complete
confinement
to
the
home,
but
it
doesn't
meet
the
other
part
of
the
test
of
jail-type
confinement.
it
is
not
at
a
facility
which
has
jail-type
rules.
it
is
a
combination
of
things.
it
has
to
be
a
serious
restriction
on
liberty
in
a
facility
which
has
jail-type
rules.
mr.
irwin
rochman
mr.
chief
justice,
jail-type
rules
i
think
are
best
exemplified
by
the
allegations
mr.
koray
made
as
to
the
rules
that
prevailed
at
the
halfway
house
that
he
was
at.
he
was
subject
to
five
security
checks
a
day.
he
was
subject
to
random
breath
and
urine
tests.
there
were
severe
limitations
on
his
visitation
rights,
both
in
time
and
manner
with
respect
to
friends
or
counsel.
he
was
afforded
significantly
less
in
the
way
of
vocational
and
educational
and
recreational
facilities
than
would
have
been
available
to
him
at
another
federal
facility.
mr.
irwin
rochman
well,
if
your
honor
would
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
an
example.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
the
standard
is
a
meaningful
one
and
one
that
can
be
applied.
it
is
neither
amorphous
nor
illusive.
if
there
is
a
serious
restriction
on
liberty
in
a
facility
at
which
there
are...
which
jail-type
rules
prevail...
let
me
bring
it
back
to
the
reality
of
the
way...
what
conditions
are
actually
imposed
by
district
courts
and
magistrates.
most
of
the...
the
most
common
conditions
are
home
confinement,
under
this
test
clearly
not...
clearly
not...
incarceration.
the
referral
to
a
drug
facility
or
an
alcohol
facility.
again,
the...
that,
i
think,
gets
a
little
closer,
but
again
it
is
not
incarceration,
as
judge
sloviter
pointed
out
in
her--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--the
reason,
i
think,
that
incarceration
is
something
that
merits
sentence
credit,
or
confinement
that's
equivalent
to
incarceration
is
something
that
merits
sentence
credit
and
home
confinement
and
residing
in
a
halfway
house
but
being
permitted
to
go
on
work
release
and
being
referred
to
a
drug
treatment
facility
are
not
the
basis
for
sentence
credit...
this
is
in
essence
a
kind
of
fairness
argument.
judge
sloviter
pointed
out
first
that
with
respect
to
mr.
koray,
most
of
the
benefits,
if
not
all
of
the
benefits,
went
to
the
government.
it
assured
his
presence
in
court.
it
kept
him
off
the
street.
it
got
the
benefit
of
the
lower
cost,
because
it
is
significantly
cheaper
to
house
someone
in
a
halfway
house
than
it
is
in
an
ordinary
federal
prison,
and
it
got...
the
space
was
saved
for
more
dangerous
prisoners.
judge
sloviter
pointed
out
it
seemed
unfair,
with
the
government
getting
all
of
those
benefits
and
koray
getting
almost
none,
if
any,
not
to
give
him
sentence
credit.
all
of
the
other
things,
justice
scalia,
that
you
have
mentioned
are
forms
of
a
sentence
of
imprisonment.
home
confinement,
residing
in
a
halfway
house,
for
instance,
may
be
a
condition
of
a
sentence
of
probation.
mr.
irwin
rochman
yes.
mr.
irwin
rochman
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
irwin
rochman
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
irwin
rochman
forgive
me
for
interrupting
you,
sir.
i
thought
you
had
finished.
i'm
sorry.
the
answer,
i
believe,
is
that
being
confined
in,
or
being
ordered
to
remain
in
a
drug
treatment
facility,
is
one
of
the
discretionary
conditions
of
a
probationary
sentence
under
section
3563.
it
is
not
part
of
a
sentence
of
incarceration.
that
is
the
view
of
congress.
in
other
words,
one
of
the
conditions
a
court
may
impose
as
part
of
a
sentence
of
probation
is
that
the
person
remain
at
a
facility
for
drug
or
alcohol
treatment,
and
what
that
statute,
3563,
provides
is
that
that
is
only
a
permissible
condition
of
probation.
mr.
irwin
rochman
if
the
person
is
there...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
irwin
rochman
i
don't
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
i'm
suggesting
it's
an
exception.
i'm
saying
that
it
is
not
a
form...
it
is
not
a...
it's
not
within
the
traditional
view
of
incarceration.
mr.
irwin
rochman
i
have
been
arguing
basically
what
judge
sloviter
suggested
would
not
be
considered
incarceration,
and
i
think
she
is
correct
simply
because,
as
i
said,
the
statute,
3563,
indicates
that
that
kind
of
confine...
if
you
want
to
call
it...
i
don't
call
it
confinement.
that
kind
of
referral
to
a
drug
or
alcohol
treatment
facility
is
not
considered
a
sentence
of
imprisonment.
it
is
simply
considered
a
sentence
of
probation.
mr.
irwin
rochman
because
the
statute,
sir,
that
we
are
interpreting,
unlike
3563,
is
not
clear,
and
although
we
say
it
has
a
clear...
there's
a
plain
meaning
to
be
found,
but
the
words
"official
detention"--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--it's
certainly
true
that
the
one
virtue
that
the
bureau
of
prisons'
position
has
is
that
it
offers
a
bright
line
test,
but
what
we
respectfully
submit
is
that
the
test
that
can
also
be
proposed,
although
it
may
not
be
a
bright
line
test,
still
has
considerable
wattage,
and
that
is
simply
that
the
notion
of
incarceration,
defined,
again...
i
don't
want
to
repeat...
defined
as
i
have
defined
it
provides
a
clear
standard
for
courts.
all
that
has
to
be
done
is
to
look
at
the
release
on
conditions
order
to
determine,
in
the
first
instance,
what
the
conditions
of
confinement,
if
any,
are,
and
the
release
on
conditions
order
under
section
3142,
i
believe
it's
(h),
the
bail
reform
act,
the
court
is
required
to
set
out
in
writing
the
specific
conditions
of
the
confinement.
mr.
irwin
rochman
when
your
honor
asks,
is
it
any
different,
the
3585(b)(2)
has
language
broad
enough
to
permit
credit,
sentence
credit
for
presentence
custody
by
state
courts,
or
in
state
facilities.
mr.
irwin
rochman
yes.
mr.
irwin
rochman
under
our
interpretation?
mr.
irwin
rochman
not
that
i'm
aware.
not
all
states
have
the
same
dichotomy
that
the
bail
reform
act
has
between
detained
versus
released.
some
states
still
use
bail
and
don't
have...
they
use
the
old-fashioned
notion
of
remand
as
opposed
to
detain.
there
are
just
simply
varying
systems
in
the
states,
as
i
understand
it,
but
i
don't
believe
i've
fully
answered
your
question.
the
problem
with
the
solicitor
general's
rationale...
i
should
say,
the
bureau
of
prisons
rationale,
what
they
argue
is
that
the
touchstone,
or
the
relevant
condition
is
custody
by
the
attorney
general,
and
in
the
hypothetical
that
i
attempted
to
suggest
to
the
court
earlier,
it
is
the
application
of
what
they
say
the
meaning
of
official
detention
is
that
results
in
that
absurd,
unreasonable,
and
glaringly
unjust
result.
because
the
application
of
that
principle,
making
the
touchstone
custody
of
the
attorney
general,
results
in
the
codefendant
confined
in
exactly
the
same
conditions,
in
exactly
the
same
place
by
a
judicial
order,
although
not
called
a
detention
order,
but
certainly
as
official
as
a
detention
order--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--that's
what--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--as
well
as
the
federal,
yes.
mr.
irwin
rochman
i
think
the
answer
is
no,
and
the
fact
that
that
test
doesn't
work
for
state
custody
it
seems
to
me
is
yet
an
additional
argument
that
it
is
an
unreasonable
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
irwin
rochman
they
may--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--they
may
well
have,
justice
scalia,
but
that
is
not
the
solicitor's
test.
the
solicitor's
test
is,
and
the
bureau
of
prisons'
position
is,
it's
custody
by
the
attorney
general.
mr.
irwin
rochman
well--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--well,
that
may
be
what
mr.
estrada
said
today,
but
that
may
fall
into
the
category
of
a
post
hoc
rationalization
of
a
government
lawyer
for
a
position
that's
not
the
actual
position--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
necessarily
difficult
to
apply,
because
again,
there
is
probably
some
officer
within
the
state,
but
i
think
it
would
do
violence
to
the
language
of
the
statute
based
on
the
government's
interpretation.
the
government
wants
to
limit--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--it
may
well
be,
but
it
can
result
in
the
same
anomalous
harsh--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--and
i
think
that
that
potential
for
resulting
unfairness
is
particularly
significant
in
construing
this
statute.
this
is
a
statute
whose
purpose...
whose
purpose
is
to
assure
fairness
in
sentencing
by
crediting
presentence
confinement--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--against
the
sentence.
mr.
irwin
rochman
i
think
that...
i'm
not
so
sure
that
i
agree,
sir,
that
that
is
an
unfairness.
i
understand
why
you
think
i
might
think
that.
mr.
irwin
rochman
well,
they
are
except
that
when
a
sentenced
prisoner
is
given
home
confinement,
or
is
given--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--halfway
house
confinement,
but
it's
not
confinement.
they're
told...
they
reside
at
halfway
houses
and
they
go
on
work
release.
that's
something
they
have
earned,
and
it
makes
sense
to
count
that
as
part
of
their
sentence.
mr.
irwin
rochman
but
i
think
in
order
to
work
with
the
phrase,
"initial
detention",
one
has
to
consider
where
the
phrase
came
from,
and
that
brings
us
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
1973.
over
the
course
of
the
years,
the
bail
reform
statute...
pardon
me,
the
sentence
credit
statute
was
enacted
in
1960.
it
has
the
word...
it
was
in
section
3568,
and
it
had
the
words
"in
custody"
in
it.
because
the
congress
in,
or
various
congresses
in
various
purported
attempted
revisions
of
the
statute
used
the
phrases
"official
detention",
"official
custody",
"custody",
and
"confinement"
interchangeably,
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
addressed
the
question,
and
the
solicitor
general
agrees,
has
determined
that
no
change
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute
was
intended
by
the
change
of
words
from
"in
custody"
to
"official
detention".
if
"official
detention"
and
"in
custody"
mean
the
same
thing,
as
that
legislative
history
and
the
court's
opinion
say
they
do,
then
there
are...
then
court
opinions
which
interpreted
the
words
"in
custody"
should
have
direct
bearing
on
the
meaning
of
the
words
in
the
statute,
and
the
courts
have
interpreted
the
word...
the
courts
interpreted
the
word
"in
custody",
or
"custody",
to
mean
total
incarceration.
i
understand
that
there
is
an
argument,
certainly,
for
crediting
parts
of
residing
at
a
halfway
house,
or
crediting
the
one-fifth
of
the
1
day
or
the
1
night,
but
the
word
that
was
used,
the
words
that
were
used,
"official
detention",
don't...
didn't
emerge
full-blown.
they
come
with
a
history,
and
that
history
says
that
"official
detention"
means
the
same
thing
as
"custody",
and
that
courts
have
interpreted
"custody"
to
mean
total
incarceration.
mr.
irwin
rochman
i
think
that's
clear
from
judge
sloviter's
opinion,
and
that
would
not
be...
that
would
not
be
total
incarceration
and
therefore
would
not
be
official
detention.
mr.
irwin
rochman
again,
sir...
i'm
sorry.
i
say
that
because
the
original
statute,
the
predecessor
statute,
used
the
phrase
"custody".
mr.
irwin
rochman
that...
pardon
me,
sir.
that
would
be
correct,
justice
scalia,
if
the
appearance
of
the
phrase
1984
when
this
statute
was
enacted,
and
in
1987
when
it
went
into
effect,
but
as
i
tried
to
make
clear
earlier,
the
words
1973,
well
before
the
bail
reform
act,
well
before
the
creation
of
the
detention
order.
they're
not
fraternal
twins,
and
that
is
why
i
say
that
the
court...
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
the
question,
the
solicitor
general
concedes
and
agrees
that
this
is
so,
that
the
use
of
the
words
"official
detention"
connotes
no
change
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute
from
the
previous
language,
which
was
"custody",
and
"custody",
according...
in
the
unanimous
interpretation
of
the
courts,
"custody"
means
total
incarceration.
and
that
is
why
i
believe
in
her
well-reasoned
opinion
judge
sloviter
limited
the
sentence
credit
that
she
permitted
to
situations
involving
total
confinement
or
incarceration,
and
had
to
reject,
and
as
she
pointed
out,
reject
things
like
residing
in
a
halfway
house
but
being
permitted
to
go
on
work
release,
or
home
confinement.
the...
there
are
other
arguments
here,
but
i
see
the
light.
mr.
irwin
rochman
yes,
sir.
that's
what
i
said.
mr.
irwin
rochman
yes.
mr.
irwin
rochman
yes,
sir,
but
in--
mr.
irwin
rochman
--that
is
correct,
but
what
i
said
was
that
in
the
legislative
history,
starting
in
1973,
there
were
various
attempts
to
amend
or
revise
the
statute,
and
in
those
suggested
revisions
of
the
statute
over
the
years,
from
1973
up
until
1984,
the
various
congresses
used
interchangeably
the
phrases
"custody",
"official
custody",
"detention",
and
"official
detention".
mr.
irwin
rochman
thank
you,
sir.
