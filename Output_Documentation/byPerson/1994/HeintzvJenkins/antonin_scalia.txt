justice

okay.
well,
does
that
have
to
mean
only
those
functions
that
only
an
attorney
can
perform?
can
you
not
be
hired
as
an
attorney
for
purposes
of
collecting
the
debt,
and
part
of
what
you
could
do
as
an
attorney
is
to
call
up
the
person
that
owes
the
debt
and
say,
"you
owe
my
client
money.
"
"i'm
the
client's
attorney.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
when
are
you
going
to
pay
the
debt?
would
that
person
be
acting
as
an
attorney,
if
he
was
hired
as
an
attorney?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
trying
to
help
you
here.
no,
okay.
[laughter]
i
would
think
he
would
be,
and
i
would
think
that
that's...
you
know,
that
as
an
attorney
does
not
necessarily
mean
doing
only
those
things
that
lawyers
can
do.
it
could
mean
doing
anything,
but
doing
it
in
the
capacity
of
having
been
hired
as
an
attorney.
and
isn't
that
what
congress
responded
to
when
it
cut
out
the
attorney
exemption,
attorneys
calling
up
people
in
the
middle
of
the
night
doing
all
the
things
that
bad
old
debt
collectors
did?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
to
say
when
they
were
acting
as
a
debt
collector.
you
want
to
say,
when,
as
attorneys,
they
were
doing
the
things
that
debt
collectors
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
they
put
that
language
in,
or
i
assume
you
think
they
put
that
language
in,
to
exclude
the
situation
where
a
fellow
who
has
a
law
degree
is
employed
by
a
collection
agency.
he
is
not
hired
by
anyone
as
an
attorney.
he
happens
to
have
a
law
degree.
if
you
exclude
all
attorneys
from
coverage
of
the
act,
as
opposed
to
people
acting
as
attorneys,
the
debt
collection
agencies
would
be
staffed
entirely
by
people
with
law
degrees,
who
would
not
be
acting
as
attorneys.
yes,
but
the
original
exemption
was
the
blanket
exemption
for
attorneys.
it
was
only
when
they
were
acting
as
attorneys.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
yes--
--well,
that--
--and
just
an
attorney-employee
of
a
debt
collection
agency
would
not
have
been
exempt
under
the
original
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
understand
it,
there
are
three
situations:
1.
people
who
have
law
degrees
are
not
even
hired
as
attorneys.
they
just
happen
to
have
law
degrees.
they
are
attorneys,
but
they're
hired
as
debt
collectors,
work
for
a
debt
collection
agency.
there's
no
attorney-client
relationship,
whatever.
situation
2,
there
is
an
attorney-client
relationship,
and
the
lawyer
is
doing
the
things
that
debt
collectors
do,
not
things
that
only
lawyers
can
do.
and
situation
3,
there
is
an
attorney-client
relationship,
and
the
lawyer
is
doing
things
which
only
lawyers
can
do.
all
right?
and
as
i
understand
your
position,
the
original
statute,
which
was
repealed,
covered
situation
1,
and
the
current
statute,
after
the
repealer,
covers
situation
2
but
does
not
cover
situation
3.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
i
go
too
fast?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
even
then,
express
permission
may
simply...
is
not
necessarily
the
same
as
specific
permission,
individualized
permission.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
long
as
it's
express,
you
could
say.
tell
me,
how
does
a
lawyer
know
when
he's
covered
by
these
things?
i
mean,
i
guess
every
lawyer
who
brings
a
case
for
collection
of
a
debt,
even
if
he
does
things
that
debt
collectors
do,
is
not
necessarily
covered
by
the
act,
isn't
that
right?
he
has
to
do
it
on
a
regular
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i'm
not
a
litigator,
and
generally
just
give
business
advice,
do
a
little
litigation
sometimes.
however,
it's
trusts
and
other
stuff,
family
matters.
occasionally
i
get
a
debt
collection
case.
i
might
not
be
covered
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
should
have
inserted
3
months
earlier.
