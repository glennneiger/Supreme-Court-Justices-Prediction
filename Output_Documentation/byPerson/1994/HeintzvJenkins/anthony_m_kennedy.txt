anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
assume
that
under
state
practice,
a
demand
letter
must
precede
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit.
would
a
demand
letter
signed
by
an
attorney
be
part
of
the
practice
of
law,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
the
law
doesn't...
the
law
just
requires
a
demand
letter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
as
long
as
you're
there,
1692c(b),
which
prohibits
communications
with
third
parties,
it
says
that
without
the
prior
consent
of
the
consumer--
--where
are
you
reading
from,
justice
kennedy?
i
have
the
statute
here...
except
with
the
prior
consent
of
the
consumer
or
the
express
permission
of
the
court,
you
may
not
communicate
with
the
debtor.
that
seems
to
me...
it
seems
to
me
answers
the
question
put
by
the
chief
justice
in
which
he
said,
perhaps
depositions
could
be
assumed
to
be
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
since
they're
in
the
rules.
this
requires
the
express
permission
of
the
court
to
communicate
with
the
client.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
but
you
can't
even
notice
the
deposition,
under
the
statute,
without
the
express
permission
of
the
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
the
point
is
somewhat
in
doubt.
