mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
otherwise
illegal
conduct
by
one
who
regularly
collects
consumer
debts
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
fair
debt
collection
practices
act
because
that
person
is
acting
as
a
lawyer.
the
statute
was
originally
passed
in
1977.
at
that
time,
in
a
number
of
states,
including
such
large
states
as
california,
a
collection
agency,
a
lay
collection
agency,
could
take
an
assignment
of
a
debt
and
bring
suit
on
it,
often
without
the
services
of
any
attorney,
to
enforce
it.
as
a
result,
the
original
version
of
the
fdcpa
which
contained
the
lawyer
exemption
also
contained
several
provisions
which
deal
expressly
with
litigation
conduct.
the
most
important
is
the
venue
restriction,
1692i.
it
applies
to
anyone
who
fits
the
definition
of
debt
collector,
and
prohibits
the
filing
of
lawsuits
in
certain
inconvenient
forums,
even
though
they
are
permitted
by
state
law,
rules
on
jurisdiction
and
venue.
there
is
in
addition
an
exemption
in
1692a(6)(d)
for
attempting
to
serve
legal
process
on
any
other
person
in
connection
with
the
judicial
enforcement
of
any
debt.
the
phrase
"judicial
enforcement
of
any
debt"
would
have
no
meaning
unless
it
were
within
the
basic
scope
of
debt
collection
activity.
1692c(b)
contains
another
pertinent
exemption.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
1692a(6)(d),
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
1692a(6)(d)
is
the
exemption
for
persons
attempting
to
serve
legal
process.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
yes,
your
honor.
the
next
exemption
that's
pertinent
is
1692c,
subdivision
(b),
and
that
provides--
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
they
are
cited
in
the
appendix
to
the
certiorari
petition,
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
yes,
your
honor.
the
second
pertinent
exemption
is
in
1692c(b),
and
that
is
an
exemption
for
third
party
communications
reasonably
necessary
to
effectuate
a
post
judgment
judicial
remedy.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
i
believe
that
some
others
were
in
the
joint
appendix.
i
apologize
if
anything
pertinent
was
omitted.
in
any
event,
we
again
have
a
statutory
provision
which
expressly
recognizes
that
the
obtention
of
a
judicial
remedy
is
part
of
debt
collection.
it,
for
example,
would
permit
the
service
of
a
citation
of
garnishment
on
the
consumer's
bank,
and
to
have
an
express
exemption
covering
certain
litigation--
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
--your
honor,
if
any
deponent
refuses
to
appear
for
a
deposition,
or
refuses
to
answer
questions--
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
--i
would
believe,
your
honor,
that
express
permission
could
be
construed
to
encompass
a
rule
or
order
of
general
applicability
authorizing
with
specificity
a
particular
activity,
such
as
noticing
a
deposition.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
in
any
event,
if
there...
if
there
is
a
question
as
to
a
matter,
nothing
prevents
the
collection
lawyer
from
applying
by
motion
to
the
court
for
permission
to
take
the
deposition.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
actually,
i
don't
believe
that's
correct.
in
most
states
depositions
are
not
permitted
unless
the
amount
in
controversy
is
over
a
certain
amount.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
in
that
case,
it
might,
if
it
is
construed
as
justice
kennedy
suggested,
require
the
permission
of
a
court
upon
application
in
a
motion.
however,
in
most
small
collection
matters,
that
would
be
required
anyway.
in
illinois,
for
example,
depositions
are
not
permitted
by
notice
if
the
debt
is
less...
is
up
to
$2,500,
so
that
a
motion
would
be
required
in
any
event.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
that
might
be
required,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
restriction--
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
--the
restriction
would
apply
only
to
third
party
witness--
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
might
be
some
room
for
debate
at
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum.
however,
the--
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
while
there
might
be
some
debate
as
to
very
marginal
situations,
that's
not
the
reality
congress
was
dealing
with
when
it
repealed
the
attorney
exemption.
basically,
there
are
law
firms
and
attorneys
that
specialize
in
the
collection
of
consumer
debts.
one
of
those
attorneys
would
not
have
any
question
in
his
mind
as
to
whether
he's
covered,
and
if
there
is
a
question
in
his
mind,
he
can
of
course
always
comply
in
any
event.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
they
would
be,
your
honor,
if
the
lawyer
then
begins
to
regularly
enforce
consumer
debts.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
in
many
respects,
the
statute
does
embody
that
principle.
for
example,
the
good
faith
reasonable
conduct
defense,
if
a
creditor
furnishes
false
information
to
the
collection
lawyer,
the
collection
lawyer,
despite
reviewing
the
matter,
does
not
detect
that
it's
false,
until
the
first
time
that
the
falsity
is
detected,
he
would
appear
to
have
a
defense.
of
course,
once
he...
once
it
is
brought
to
his
attention
that
the
creditor
is
not
providing
accurate
information,
then
he
would
have
further
obligations.
all
of
this
was
addressed
in
the...
at
the
time
that
the
attorney
exemption
was
repealed.
the
reason
that
the
attorney
exemption
was
repealed
was
that
between
1978,
when
the
organized
bar
secured
the
original
attorney
exemption,
and
1986,
the
federal
trade
commission
received
some
1,400
complaints
about
law
firms
engaged
in
collection
activities,
and
the
number
of
law
firms
that
were
engaged
in
collection
activities
increased
dramatically.
some
of
them
were
actually
advertising
that
they
were
not
subject
to
the
restrictions
that
lay
debt
collection
agencies
had.
for
example--
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
--that's
correct.
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
statutory
history,
that
there
was
an
attorney
exemption,
and
that
it
was
removed,
and
that
congress
expressly
declined
to
adopt
a
substitute
exemption
for
attorneys
acting
in
court
as
attorneys
as
sufficient
to
resolve
the
problem.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
no,
your
honor,
because
the
statute
only
applies
to
the
collection
of
consumer
debt.
debt
is
defined
as
limited
to
consumer
debt.
those
were
business
transactions,
and
if
those--
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
--it
basically...
your
honor,
it
basically
tracks
the
definitions
found
in
the
other
titles
of
the
consumer
credit
protection
act.
it's
normally
not
difficult
to
determine
whether
something
is
a
consumer
debt.
for
example,
if
a
truth
in
lending
statement
was
issued
in
connection
with
the
underlying
indebtedness,
it's
a
fair
inference
that
it's
a
consumer
debt.
debts
incurred
to
corporations
would
never
be
considered
to
be
consumer
debts.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
that
is
not
considered
to
be
a
consumer
debt.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
only
debts
owed
by
natural...
or
allegedly
owed
by
natural
persons
would
be
covered,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
that
would
not
be
covered,
your
honor.
the
term
1692a(5)
as
an
obligation
or
alleged
obligation
of
a
consumer
to
pay
money
arising
out
of
a
transaction
in
which
the
money,
property,
insurance,
or
services,
three
dots,
are
primarily
for
personal,
family,
or
household
purposes,
so
if
we're
talking
about
raw
materials
for
manufacturing,
that's
not
for
household
purposes.
again,
there
might
be
some
gray
areas
which
can
be
easily
dealt
with
by
complying
with
the
statute,
but
if
the
debt
consists
of
raw
materials
for
manufacturing
sold
to
a
corporation,
or
sold
to
somebody
using
a
business
title
or
name,
that
is
quite
clearly
not
a
consumer
debt,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
that
is
correct,
they
are
covered.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
fact--
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
--not
really,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
1692c(c),
which
is
the
ceasing
communication
provision--
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
--contains
an
express
exemption
for
telling
the
consumer
that
we're
going
to
invoke
specified
remedies.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
and
you
sue.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
there
is
nothing
which
would
prevent
that.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
i
would
construe
the
remedy,
your
honor,
as
including--
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
--the
legislative
history
indicates
precisely
that.
the
purpose
of
this
c(c)
exemption
was
to
bring...
was
to
permit
the
consumer
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
head
by
in
effect
demanding
that
the
debt
collector
sue
them,
so--
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
--that
is
correct,
but--
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
--i
don't
think
it's
too
much
of
an
implication
to
say
that
notification
that
one
is
going
to
invoke
a
specified
remedy
would
include,
for
example,
notifying
the
consumer's
deposition.
there
is
the
question
as
to
third
party
depositions,
which
are
very
unusual
in
debt
collection
cases,
even
mortgage
foreclosures,
your
honor.
going
back
to
the
1986
repeal
of
the
attorney
exemption,
congress
expressly
stated
in
the
legislative
history
that
its
intent
was
to
place
attorneys
and
lay
collection
agencies,
which
again
at
that
time
had,
in
a
number
of
states,
the
right
to
take
assignments
of
debts
and
sue,
on
the
same
footing,
and
the
principle
complaint
that...
among
the
1,400
received
by
the
federal
trade
commission,
concerned
attorney
contact.
namely,
attorneys
filing
suit
in
improper
or
prohibited
venues.
they
could
be,
in
fact,
permitted
by
state
law,
but
they
were
not
consistent
with
1692i.
congress
responded
to
this
concern
by
totally
deleting
the
attorney
exemption
and
refusing
to
enact
statutes
which
were
proposed
by
the
commercial
law
league
and
the
aba,
and
representative
hiler,
to
the
effect
that
there
would
remain
an
attorney
exemption.
as
a
result,
we
have
a
statute
which
once
contained
an
express
exclusion
for
the
matter
at
issue
here,
was
amended
to
remove
the
express
exclusion,
and
where
congress
declined
to
enact
precisely
that
position
which
petitioners
contend,
namely
that
litigation
conduct
is
not
covered.
with
respect
to
the
other
absurd
results,
in
some
17
years,
the
statute
has
been
construed
in
a
reasonable
and
rational
manner
by
the
lower
federal
courts.
it
has
never,
for
example,
been
held
that
if
a
lawyer
files
a
collection
action
and
loses,
that
that
violates
the
prohibition
against...
that
one
cannot
take
action
if
it
is
not
lawful
to
take
it.
it
has
never
been
construed
to
permit
the
debtor
to
direct
the
attorney
not
to
file
suit
against
him.
on
the
contrary,
the
purpose
of
1692c
is
to
require
the...
is
to
allow
the
consumer
to
force
the
debt
collector
to
sue.
some
question
is
raised
in
the
briefs
as
to
whether
the
1692g
notice
has
to
be
attached
to
a
pleading,
if
that's
the
first
that
the
debtor
hears
from
the
debt
collector.
the
answer
is,
it
is
probably
not
a
communication,
but
in
any
event
it
is
a
common
and,
in
effect,
general
practice
among
collection
attorneys
to
attach
a
sheet
of
paper
to
the
end
of
the
first
pleading
containing
the
fdcpa
warnings.
so
that
the
parade
of
horribles
that
was
suggested
by
petitioners
and
appears
to
have
been
suggested
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
one
decision
supporting
their
position,
green,
is
simply
not
there
if
the
act
is
construed
carefully
and
in
a
reasonable
manner.
the
only
other
support
which
petitioners
point
to
are
two
things.
the
first
is
a
very
ambiguous
statement
that
representative
annunzio
had
inserted
in
the
congressional
record
3
months
after
the
statute
was
passed,
and
when
nothing
pertaining
to
the
fdcpa
was
before
the
congress.
it's
not
legislative
history,
even
if
one
can
extract
from
certain--
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
--well,
i
think
the
court
has
consistently
made
a
difference,
a
distinction,
between
legislative
history
which
predates
the
enactment
of
a
statute,
and
something
which...
this
wasn't
even
spoken
to
congress
on
the
floor
of
the
house.
it
was
inserted
pursuant
to
privilege
in
the
congressional
record
one
night
3
months
afterwards.
it's
not
permissible
legislative
history.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
i
won't
comment
on
that.
i
don't
know
enough
about
1001,
your
honor.
the
other
is
the
commentary
by
the
ftc
staff.
it's
not
the
ftc
itself.
the
ftc
staff
supported
the
position
of
the
aba
and
the
commercial
law
league
and
representative
hiler
that
there
should
be
an
attorney
exemption
in
1986.
even
after
congress
rejected
that
position,
the
ftc
staff
came
out
with
this
commentary
which
said,
we're
not
going
to
enforce
the
act
against
attorneys
engaged
in
litigation.
the
ftc...
not
even
the
commission
itself
has
rule-making
authority
under
the
fair
debt
collection
practices
act.
it's
a
fairly
unique
situation.
there's
very
broad
rule-making
authority
given
to
the
enforcing
agencies
under
the
other
eight
or
nine
titles
of
the
consumer
credit
protection
act,
but
in
this
one
case,
the
enforcing
authority
is
completely
denied
any
rule-making
authority
whatever.
and
notwithstanding
this,
we
have
a
commentary
which
is
read
by
petitioners
to
say...
to
create
an
exemption.
there
is
no
authority
to
create
such
an
exemption.
an
administrative
agency,
much
less
its
staff,
cannot
create
statutory
exemptions
without
some
basis
in
the
congressional
enactment
that
purports
to
authorize
it.
the
staff
commentary,
incidentally,
does
not
actually
support
petitioner's
position
in
this
case,
insofar
as
it
applies
to
the
letter.
the
staff
says
that
if
an
attorney
does
not
engage
regularly
in
consumer
debt
collection
activity,
he's
not
subject
to
the
act
insofar
as
litigation
conduct
is
concerned,
but
it
is
now
conceded
by
petitioners
that
they
do
engage
regularly
in
consumer
debt
collection
activity,
such
as
sending
consumers
dunning
letters.
so
basically,
we
have
a
statute
which
i
think
is
plain
on
its
face,
when
you
consider
the
sequence
of
basic
definition
of
debt
collection,
which
even
in
black's
law
dictionary
covers
suing
someone
for
a
debt,
the
original
attorney
exemption,
and
the
removal
of
that
attorney
exemption
while
all
along
litigation
conduct
by
collection
agencies
is
regulated,
and
intentionally
regulated,
by
the
statute.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
you
find,
again,
an
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
subject
lawyers
to
regulation
that
did
not
heretofore
exist.
mr.
daniel
a.
edelman
your
honor,
insofar
as
the
issue
before
the
court
is
concerned,
namely,
adding
charges
to
debts
which
are
not
expressly
authorized,
congress
intentionally,
and
with
application
to
both
lawyers
and
other
debt
collectors,
imposed
a
strict
standard.
a
consumer
cannot
be
subjected
to
any
charge
that
someone
might
be
able
to
dream
up
a
nonfrivolous
argument
in
support
of.
congress
was
careful
about
this,
because
it
realized
that
the
vast
majority
of
collection
lawsuits
go
by
way
of
default
judgment.
there
is
no
one
there
to
argue
against
the
lawyer,
and
accordingly,
it
made
the
standard
one
of
whether
the
debt
is
expressly
authorized,
or
whether
the
charge
is
expressly
authorized
by
the
instrument
creating
the
debt,
or
permitted
by
law.
it's
not
an
unfair
standard,
because
first,
if
no
one
is
going
to
argue
against
the
imposition
of
the
charge,
it
shouldn't
be
routinely
imposed
where
it
will
greatly...
as
in
this
case,
greatly
increase
the
amount
of
the
debt,
and
the
consumer
is
not
represented
and
says
nothing.
in
addition,
normally,
most
collection
lawyers
are
enforcing
printed
form
contracts.
it's
very
easy
for
the
creditor
to
solve
the
problem
by
simply
providing
for
the
charge,
and
then
if
it's
not
prohibited
by
law,
it
falls
within
1692f(1).
so
congress
did
tighten
the
standard,
and
it
would
not
be
appropriate
for
an
attorney
to
argue
that
a
consumer
is
liable
for
insurance
or
some
other
charge
that
a
nonfrivolous
argument
could
be
made
with
respect
to,
but
which
is
not
expressly
authorized
in
the
instrument
creating
the
debt.
that
problem,
or
that
restraint,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
attorney's
status
as
attorney.
the
collection
agency
can't
demand
such
a
charge
before
the
matter
is
in
litigation,
or
during
litigation,
and
the
same
restraint
is
imposed
upon
the
attorney.
so
the
answer
to
your
honor's
inquiry,
your
honor,
is
that
the
act
imposes
certain
restrictions,
it
imposes
them
equally
upon
lawyers
and
nonlawyers
who
are
collecting
consumer
debts,
and
in
the
17
years
that
the
act
has
been
applied
to
collection
agencies,
these
restrictions
have
not
been
found
to
impose
an
undue
burden
upon
the
collection
of
debts
for
consumers
or
the
extension
of
consumer
credit.
congress
had
a...
was
faced
with
a
problem
in
balancing
the
interests
of
collection
agencies
and
then
collection
lawyers
on
the
one
hand
and
the
public
on
the
other,
it
drew
that
balance
very
carefully,
and
i
think
the
judgment
of
congress
as
expressed
in
the
act
should
be
respected.
that
judgment
does
not
permit
of
an
attorney
litigation
exemption.
what
the
petitioner's
argument,
i
think,
really
boils
down
to
is
an
appeal
to
the
reluctance
of
attorneys
to
impose
liability
on
other
attorneys.
the
problem
with
that
position
is
that
congress
did
exactly
that
after
an
8-year
trial
period
of
an
exemption,
and
specific
provisions
of
the
act
address
explicitly
litigation
conduct.
there
is
simply
no
textual
basis
for
a
continued
attorney
exemption,
whether
limited
to
litigation
or
otherwise.
unless
the
court
has
questions,
that
concludes
my
remarks.
