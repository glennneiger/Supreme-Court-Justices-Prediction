well,
congress
certainly
did
drop
the
exception
that
used
to
be
in
there
for
lawyers,
didn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
certainly
points
in
the
direction
of
at
least
opening
the
question
as
to
whether
the
definition
of
debt
collector
extends
to
lawyers
who
regularly
collect
or
attempt
to
collect
debts
owed
to
another.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
language
literally
can
cover
that
kind
of
an
attorney.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
looking
at
the
definition
of
debt
collector,
and
if
you
look
at
that
in
light
of
congress'
repeal
of
any
exception
for
lawyers,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
a
lawyer
could
be
a
debt
collector.
now,
it
may
raise
other
practical
problems,
but
if
you
look
at
that
definition,
it
would
appear
possible
that
a
lawyer
could
be
a
debt
collector.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
section
1692c(b)
allows
communication
with
the
attorney
for
the
debtor...
i
mean,
expressly
allows
it...
so
it
seems
to
me
the
statute
contemplates
that
yes,
lawyers,
when
acting
as
debt
collectors,
can
communicate
with
the
debtor's
attorney.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
by
express
provision
in
the
statute,
so--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
don't
think
that's
part
of
the
chamber
of
horrors.
there's
an
exception
for
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
not
your
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
but
some
states
require
that
a
demand
letter
be
sent
before
executing
on
a
promissory
note,
and
this
is
required
in
the
pleadings.
would
the
sending
of
a
demand
letter
be
part
of
the
practice
of
law,
in
your
view,
if
the
attorney
sent
the
demand
letter?
would
that
be
protected?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
there's
an
exception
with
the
express
permission
of
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
a
deposition
order,
yes.
i
mean,
that's
not
unusual,
either.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
isn't
what
it
says.
it
says,
in
1692c(b),
that
deals
with
communications
to
third
parties,
not
a
communication
to
the
consumer
debtor
himself,
and
the
consumer
debtor
can
be
noticed
under
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
this
only
deals
with
communications
to
third
parties,
and
it
says
that
the
consumer,
the
debtor,
or
the
consumer
debtor's
attorney,
are
not...
you're
not
prevented
from
communicating
with
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
i
think
you're
misreading
it.
that
appears
to
be
correct.
