we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-367,
george
w.
heintz
v.
darlene
jenkins.
mr.
spellmire.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
just
writing
a
letter,
which
many
perfectly
legitimate
collection
lawyers
do?
before
you
file
a
lawsuit,
maybe
we
can
get
this
by
letter.
is
that
covered
in
so-called
2?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
only
when
you
file
a
lawsuit,
under
your
view,
on
behalf
of
a
client,
that
a
lawyer
is
exempt?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
those
be?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
those
be,
like
taking
a
deposition,
request
for
admissions,
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
correspondence
with
opposing
counsel
be
not
covered,
but
a
letter
to
the
potential
defendant
covered?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
an
ordinary
notice
of
deposition,
pursuant
to
the
rules,
would
imply
the
permission
of
the
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
realize
you
don't
need
a
court
approval
to
notice
someone's
deposition,
but
the
rules
provide
for
the
notice,
and
it
seems
to
me
one
could
argue
that
is
enough
to
show
that
the
court...
court
approval
under
this
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
spellmire.
mr.
edelman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--would
you
say
that
again?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
also,
petition
for
certiorari
appendix
24,
25,
26,
27.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
edelman,
what
if
i'm
a
lawyer
who
represents
a
bank,
and
the
bank,
say,
has
a
number
of
floor
plan
arrangements
with
automobile
dealers,
and
so
in
march
i
sue
one
dealer
for
half-a-million
dollars
for
defaulting
on
a
floor
plan
arrangement.
in
april
i
sue
another
dealer
on
behalf
of
the
bank
for
three-quarters
of
a
million
dollars
for
defaulting
on
a
floor
plan
arrangement,
and
in
may
i
sue
still
another
dealer
for
a
million
dollars,
am
i
a
debt
collector?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
a
consumer
debt
is
something
incurred
by
someone
who
plans
to
make
use
of
the
thing
themselves?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
corporation
buys
a
lot
of
products
to
consume
them
in
its
manufacturing
process?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
a
"consumer
debt"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
howard
hughes,
doing
business
in
his
own
name,
buys
a
million
dollars'
worth
of
stuff,
they
use
them
to
make
airplanes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
edelman.
mr.
spellmire,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say,
his
supplemental
report,
was
this
something
other
than
just
his
own
individual
doing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
spellmire.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
94-367
heintz
against
jenkins
will
be
announced
by
