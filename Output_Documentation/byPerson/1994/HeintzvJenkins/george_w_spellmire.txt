mr.
george
w.
spellmire
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court:
the
fair
debt
collection
practices
act
should
not
be
read
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
lawyers
engaged
in
the
prosecution
of
litigation
even
if
that
litigation
is
against
the
consumer
for
the
collection
of
a
debt,
and
as
those
terms
are
defined
in
the
act.
the
act,
when
read
as
a
whole,
demonstrates
that
it
was
not
intended
to
regulate
the
behavior
or
conduct
of
attorneys
when
they
are
performing
acts
which
are
uniquely
capable
of
performance
by
attorneys
by
reason
of
their
licensure.
the
act
is
ambiguous,
and
a...
by
its
definition
of
debt
collector,
and
a
literal
application
of
the
language
of
that
statute,
that
act,
would
result
in
absurd
outcomes,
when
reviewed
with
other
statutes.
the
congressional
intent
clearly
establishes
that
congress
never
intended
the
act
to
reach
the
conduct
of
lawyers
performing
the
function
of
lawyers.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
it
did
drop
that
exception.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
i
think
there
is
no
question,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
your
honor,
i
do...
the
petitioner
does
not
agree
that
the
language,
when
read
in
light
of
the
entire
statute,
could
be
interpreted
as
the
court
has
suggested
its
interpretation.
when
congress
removed
the
exception--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--your
honor,
the
definition,
taken
in
the
context
of
the
statute,
is
ambiguous.
there's
no
question
that
an
attorney
can
perform
the
activities
of
a
debt
collector,
and
when
performing
the
activities
of
a
debt
collector
would
be
governed
by
this
act.
i
think
the
phrase
"debt
collector"
is
clearly
understandable
when
it
is
focused
to
collection
agencies
who
through
the
mails
or
through
the
use
of
phone
contact
bring
personal
pressure
and
contact
to
bear
upon
an
individual
to
pay
a
debt.
a
lawyer,
on
the
other
hand,
engaged
in
litigation,
applies
to
a
court,
and
asks
a
court
to
find
a
debt
to
be
due,
and
asks
a
court
to
order
the
payment
of
that
debt.
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two,
and
when
read
in
the
context
of
this
statute,
the
definition
of
"debt
collector"
unless...
unless
there
is
some
explanation
of
what
it
means
to
collect
a
debt,
remains
ambiguous.
since
it
is
ambiguous--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--no,
it
does
not.
let
me
explain.
when
congress
initially
enacted
this
legislation,
it
did
have
the
exception,
and
lawyers,
attorneys,
in
all
of
their
functions
when
representing
a
client,
were
exempted
from
its
coverage.
following
that
enactment,
lawyers
then
entered
into
the
debt
collection
business
in
competition
with
lay
debt
collectors.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
they
performed--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--they
were...
yes,
they
were
still
representing
clients,
but
the
activities--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--they
were
representing
clients,
but
in
order
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
term
"debt
collector"
within
that
statute,
given
its
ambiguity,
one
has
to
examine
the
purposes
for
which
the
exceptions
were
removed,
and
the
purpose
and
the
congressional
intention
in
removing
the
statute
was
to
subject
attorneys,
when
they
engaged
in
the
same
activities
as
lay
debt
collectors,
to
the
same
rules.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
your
honor,
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
concerning
this
amendment.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
at
the
time
the
exception
was
enacted
with
the
original
enactment
of
the
act,
attorneys--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--that
is
what
the
text
says.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
you--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--no.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
that
was
the
purpose,
was
to
include
attorneys
when
they
were
acting
as
a
debt
collector,
when
they
were
engaging
in
the
kinds
of
activities
that
were
forbidden
by
the
act--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--i
will
accept
the
court's
statement.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
the
text
read
the
way
it
did
when
it
was
originally
enacted
because
at
that
time
attorneys
had
not
invaded
the
debt
collection
business
as
they
did
in
the
years
intervening.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
your
honor,
at
the
time
of
the
original
enactment,
inasmuch
as
congress
was
exempting
attorneys,
congress
was
not
concerned
with
the
types
of
activities
attorneys
were
engaged
in
at
that
time.
it
became...
it
was
later
that
they
became
concerned
with
the
types
of
activities
that
attorneys
were
engaged
in,
that
is,
attorneys
performing
debt
collecting
activities.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
right,
for
a
client.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
not
by
reason
of
its
language.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
that
is
correct.
an
attorney
should
not
be
regulated
by
this
act
when
performing
the
functions
peculiar
to
the--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--no,
your
honor,
we
are
not
asking
that.
we
are
asking
that
the
congressional
intent
be
implemented
by
reason
of
the
ambiguity
contained
in
this
statute,
and
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
interfere
with
or
regulate
the
practice
of
law
by
lawyers
in
their
capacity
as
lawyers
in
this
country.
what
they
did
intend
to
do
was,
to
the
extent
attorneys
engaged
in
activities
similar
to
those
forbidden
by
this
act,
that
they
should
be
regulated
by
the
act.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
i
believe
that
the...
i
believe--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--no,
your
honor.
the
statute
as--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--the
statute
as
originally
enacted
would
have
exempted
situations
2
and
3.
we
are...
it
is
our
position
that
in
repealing
the
exemption,
congress
meant
to
include
example
2
but
did
not
mean
to
include
example
3.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
no.
when
the
act...
when
the
exemption
was
repealed,
it
is
true
that
example
number
2
then
fell
within
the
act.
harassing
phone
calls,
threats,
contacting
employers.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
since
that
letter
could
be
written
by
a
person
who
does
not
possess
a
law
license,
that
could
be
covered,
and
that
lawyer,
in
that
act,
would
fall
within
the
purview
of
the
fair
debt
collection
practices
act,
according
to
our
interpretation
of
that
act.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
the...
yes,
and
when
you
perform
other
functions
that
are
incidental
and
necessary--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--to
the
prosecution
of
that
lawsuit.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
correspondence
with
opposing
counsel
that
is
aimed
at
bringing
the
case
towards
a
conclusion.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
the
reason
is
that
in
representing
a
client
in
a
case,
only
a
lawyer
can
perform
the
functions
of
dealing
with
other
counsel
that
can
move
the
case
forward
to
resolution.
a
lawyer
has
to
have
a
license
to
represent
a
third
party
in
a
courtroom,
and
that
lawyer
then,
in
the
conduct
of
the
litigation,
even
in
the
writing
of
letters
to
counsel,
or
in
dealing
with
witnesses,
has
to
have
that
license
to
do
that.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
unless
it
is
a
function
that
is
peculiar
to
the
practice
of
law
by
reason
of
the
license--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--yes.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
they
certainly
can,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
they
can.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
no,
i
do
not...
it
is
not
our
position
that
a
debt
collector
cannot
correspond
with
counsel
for
a
debtor,
not
at
all,
but
that
correspondence
has
to--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--no,
it
is
not,
your
honor,
part
of
our
argument.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
your
honor,
i
am
not
familiar
with
those
statutes,
and
i--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--if
the
law
required
an
attorney
to--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--then
if
that
demand
letter
were
to
violate
the
statutory
prohibitions
of
the
act,
then
it
would
be
within
the
act.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
your
honor,
the
good
faith
exception
that
you
have
just
mentioned
has
been
very
narrowly
construed
by
the
lower
courts.
consequently,
it
is
basically,
as
they
interpret
it
in
any
event,
a
defense
that
allows
for
clerical
errors
provided
the
business
enterprise
has
sufficient
safeguards
within
its
procedures
to
prevent
such
clerical
errors.
it
is
not
a
defense
in
the
sense
that
you
just...
in
the
sense
that
it
was
just
described--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--as
interpreted
by
those
courts.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
that
might
be.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
as
good
faith
has
been
described,
that
would
solve
that
problem.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
under
1962c(c)
of
the
act,
a
debtor
can
express
the
desire
to
no
longer
be
contacted,
and
that
can
bring
about
a
cessation
of
any
contacts
with
that
debt
collector
by
anybody...
excuse
me,
debtor
by
anybody.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
that
would
permit
that,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
that
would
be
permitted.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
the
verification
and
disclosure
provisions
would
be
applicable
to
pleadings,
to
complaints,
and
to
virtually
all
documents
that
constituted
communications
that
would
be
sent.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
your
honor,
may
i
return
to
your
prior
question
for
a
second?
while
the
answer
that
i
gave
to
that
question
was
accurate,
in
the
context,
however,
of,
for
example,
a
deposition,
should
the
debtor
take
the
position
that
the
debt
is
disputed,
that
would
have
to
terminate
all
activities
at
that
time
with
respect
to
that
deposition.
this
would
allow
for
the
very
serious
disruption,
if
it
were
utilized,
of
this
act
to
frustrate
the
normal
rules
of
procedure.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
that
would
still
require,
your
honor,
an
attorney
to
apply
to
a
court
if
it
occurred
at
a
deposition.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
it
is
very
unusual,
your
honor,
in
the
normal
litigation
context,
for
a
deponent
party
to
determine
that
that
party
no
longer
wishes
to
be
communicated
with.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
imply,
necessarily,
the
permission
of
the
court,
because
very
often,
such
notices
may
be
sent
unilaterally.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
the
rules
do
provide
a
framework
in
which
the
parties
may
conduct
discovery.
this
statute,
however,
also
has
rules
pertaining
to
communications.
i'm
not
aware
of
a
case
that
has
answered
any
question
concerning
its
application
in
the
context
of
litigation.
i
am
aware
that
the
federal
trade
commission,
in
its
view
of
this
statute,
considers
the
application
of
this
statute,
for
example,
in
the
context
of
litigation,
to
be
impractical
and
unworkable.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
your
honor,
i
believe
a
fair
interpretation
of
that
particular
exception
indicates
the
intention
of
congress
that
the
act
not
apply
to
matters
that
occur
in
the
litigation
context.
now--
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
--pursuant
to
their
intention,
and
their
congressional
purpose
in
this
law,
they
didn't
need
any
further
exemption,
because
attorneys
from
their
view,
congress'
view,
were
not
within
the
ambit
of
this
act
when
they
were
engaged
in
litigation
and...
engaged
in
litigation,
so
it
is
consistent,
really,
with
the
congressional
purpose
and
intent
that
this
law...
that
this
act
not
discuss
legal
activities
following
the
initiation
of
a
suit.
the
only...
the
only
reference
in
the
act
to
a
legal
action
is
section
1962i,
which
describes
the
venues
in
which
suit
may
be
brought.
that
section
was
enacted
at
a
time
when
attorneys
remained
exempt.
it
was
enacted
originally
with
the
act
itself
in
1977,
and
should
not
be
read
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
regulate
the
litigation
of
cases.
rather,
that
was
intended
to
prevent
a
collection
tactic
which
congress
considered
to
be
abusive,
and
that
tactic
was
the
filing
of
litigation
in
locations
that
were
inconvenient
to
the
debtor.
it
should
not
be
interpreted
as
indicating
a
congressional
intent
to
regulate
lawyers
as
they
practice
law
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
within
the
act,
there
are
no
provisions
which
deal
with
the
regulation
of
lawyers
in
litigation.
the
focus
that
is
appropriate
is,
what
was
the
intention
of
congress
when
they
enacted
this
law,
and
whether
the
definition
of
"debt
collector"
has
a
fair
meaning
when
read
in
the
context
of
the
entire
statute.
it
is
clear,
or
should
be
clear,
that
it
is
ambiguous.
since
it
is
ambiguous,
the
intention
of
congress
should
be
examined,
and
the
intention
of
congress
is
clear,
as
well
as
the
interpretation
of
the
ftc,
although
not
binding.
finally,
mr
annunzio,
representative
annunzio,
prior
to
the
enactment,
stated
that
the
amendment
would
not
affect
the
practice
of
law
by
the
nation's
attorneys.
when
he
filed
his
supplemental
report,
he
was
amplifying
on
that
point
that
had
been
previously
made.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
your
honor,
he
was
the
sole
sponsor
of
the
act.
when
he
wrote
his
explanation,
which
was
included
in
the
record,
it
explains
the
sponsor's
intention.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
w.
spellmire
thank
you.
