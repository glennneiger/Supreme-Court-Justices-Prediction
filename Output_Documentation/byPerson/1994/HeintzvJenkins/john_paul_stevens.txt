justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask,
are
these
different
provisions
in
your
paper
somewhere?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
were
you
reading
from?
it's
hard
to
follow
the
argument
with
all
these
subsections.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
one
that
is
not
included
in
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
you
would
have
to
acknowledge
that
this
would
require
a
change
in
normal
litigation
practice
for
a
collection
lawyer,
that
most
lawyers
wouldn't
have
to
do
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
suppose
it
is
over
a
certain
amount.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you've
got
$2,600
at
issue,
you
would
have
to...
unlike
most
lawyers,
you'd
have
to
go
to
court...
if
you
read
the
statute
literally,
you'd
have
to
go
to
court
and
get
permission
to
take
a
deposition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
suppose
he
could
have
been
prosecuted
under
a
1001?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean,
he
was
the
sponsor
of
the
amendment
which
took
the
attorney
exemption
out?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
incidentally,
it's
an
unusual
case
in
another
way.
i
see
judge
manion
and
judge
fairchild
agreed
with
one
another.
