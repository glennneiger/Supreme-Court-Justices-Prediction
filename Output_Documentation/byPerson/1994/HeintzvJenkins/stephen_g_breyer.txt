it
would
be
helpful
to
me
if
you
could
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
and
list
what
would
be
in
this
chamber
of
horrors.
i
mean,
i
did
feel
that
the
brief
had
quite
a
few,
what
you
called
anomalies,
but
then
when
i
went
through
the
statute,
it
didn't
seem
they
were
quite
so
anomalous,
and
that's
why
i
wonder
which...
what
bad
things
will
happen
if
it
does
cover
attorneys?
for
example,
the
attorney
would
be
liable
if
it
turned
out
that
the
debt
wasn't
real,
but
there
is
a
good
faith
exception,
i
gather,
so
that
the
attorney
would
be
liable
only
when
he
didn't
act
in
good
faith.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
maybe
that's
not
right
as
applied
to
a
lawyer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
it
says
is,
a
debt
collector
may
not
be
held
liable
if
the
violation
was
not
intentional,
and
resulted
from
a
bona
fide
error,
so
if
in
fact
the
client
comes
and
says,
a,
b,
and
c
is
true,
the
lawyer
thinks
that's
probably
right,
puts
him
on
the
stand,
the
jury
disbelieves
him,
the
lawyer
would
not
be
liable,
as
long
as
the
lawyer
was
in
good
faith.
is
that
right?
i
mean,
doesn't
that
solve
most
of
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what
other
problems
are
in
the
chamber?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
says
you
can
communicate
to...
where
the
creditor
intends
to
invoke
a
specified
remedy.
might
that
not
imply
that
the
lawyer
can
then
go
ahead
and
invoke
the
specified
remedy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
then
that
would
get
rid
of
that
horror.
what's
the
next
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
harm
does
that
cause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
this
work,
though?
i
take
it
that
home
mortgages
would
be
covered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
can
be
a
lot
of
money,
and
suppose
that
the
person
collects
home
mortgages,
i.e.,
he
brings
lawsuits.
that's
part
of
his
practice.
i
take
it
he
would
be
covered,
that
person?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
what
happens
when
they
want
to
bring
a
suit,
and
there's
a
lot
of
money
involved,
maybe
a
million
dollars.
that's
up
there.
and
the
lawyer
would
like
to
depose
a
witness,
indeed,
also
would
like
to
talk
to
the...
would
like
to
depose
the
consumer,
the
borrower.
the
borrower
writes
back
and
says,
"i
will
not
pay.
"
"i
don't
think
i
owe
it.
"
now,
how
does
it
work?
as
i
read
this,
it's
a
little
tough
for
the
lawyer
to
go
and
talk
to
the
borrower.
in
fact,
it
says
you
should
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
now
we
say,
i'm
going
to
sue
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
what
the
lawyer
wants
to
do
is,
he
wants
to
go
and
talk
at
the
deposition
to
the
borrower.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
words
that
"shall
cease
further
communication
with
the
consumer?
"
what
about
those
words,
1,
2,
or
3?
and
i
didn't
see...
at
least
reading
it
literally,
it
was
rather
tough
to
see
where
that
came
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
we're...
so
that's
what
we
would
have
to
do.
you'd
have
to
say
the
words,
to
invoke
a
specified
remedy
include,
to
invoke
a
specified
remedy,
and
then
going
on
to
implement
that
specified
remedy,
and
therefore
we
would
have
to
read
into
this
silence
everything
to
do
with
a
lawsuit
where
you
talk
to
the
consumer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
is
no
specific
thing
that
talks
about
the
communications
that
go
on
during
a
lawsuit,
i
take
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we'd
have
to
imply
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
term
“debt
collector”
in
the
fair
debt
collection
practices
act
applies
to
lawyers
who
regularly
collect
consumer
debts
in
litigation.
now,
this
act
is
an
act
that
basically
makes
all
kinds
of
harassing
phone
calls,
and
not
telling
the
truth
about
debts
that
makes
them
unlawful
and
that’s
engaged
in
by
people
who
regularly
collect
consumer
debts.
so,
the
question
is
there’s
a
litigating
lawyer
fall
within
that
definition.
the
case
was
brought
by
a
woman
who
in
fact
didn’t
pay
allegedly
a
debt
that
she
owed
for
buying
a
car,
and
the
lawyer
in
the
case
said,
you
better
pay
$4,000
for
insurance,
and
she
said
$4,000,
i
didn’t
promise
to
pay
that
$4,000.
i
promised
to
pay
a
much
lower
insurance
because
you
bought
some
insurance
in
fact
that
insures
the
bank
against
my
not
paying
the
debt
back.
that
was
not
part
of
the
deal.
it
never
got
to
court
very
far
because
it
was
dismissed
on
the
basis
that
the
act
does
not
cover
a
litigating
lawyer.
so,
that’s
the
question.
now,
we
find
that
it
does
cover
litigating
lawyers,
and
there
are
two
very
strong
reasons,
why?
the
first
is
if
you
look
at
the
act,
it
says
in
the
definition
that
a
debt
collector
is
a
person
who
regularly
collects
or
attempts
to
collect
debts
owed
to
another,
and
a
litigating
lawyer,
who
does
that
does
that.
the
second
reason
is
that
there
is
to
be
an
exemption
in
this
law
that
exempted
all
lawyers,
but
congress
focused
on
that,
and
repealed
the
exemption.
now,
compare
to
those
two
strong
reasons.
the
reasons
on
the
other
side
we
thought
weren’t
so
strong.
it
was
argued
that
they’re
anomalous
in
this
deal,
but
make
it
not
too
sensible
this
law
to
apply
it
to
lawyers.
well,
we
went
through
those
and
found
that
they
weren’t
so
anomalous
as
mr.
heintz
had
claimed.
and
second,
there
was
a
statement
by
a
representative
who
said
at
the
time
this
act
does
not
apply
to
litigating
lawyers,
but
he
said
it
after
the
law
was
passed,
and
if
you
look
at
the
floor
of
statements,
it
looks
as
if
congress
thought
that
it
might
well
apply
to
litigating
lawyers.
and
finally
the
federal
trade
commission
said
we’re
not
certain
it
applies,
we
think
it
doesn’t,
but
they
weren’t
certain,
and
their
statement
doesn’t
weight
strongly
enough
when
looking
at
the
reasons
for.
therefore
our
decision
is
that
it
does
apply
and
the
decision
is
unanimous.
