isn't
the
ambiguity,
though,
answered
by
the
terms
that
were
repealed,
because
prior
to
the
amendment
the
statute
didn't
merely
have
a
general
exception
for
lawyers,
the
exception
read,
any
attorney
at
law
collecting
a
debt
as
an
attorney
on
behalf
of.
that
seems
to
refer
to
the
peculiar
functions
that
lawyers
perform,
and
it
would
seem
that
the
exception
that
used
to
be
there
is,
in
its
terms,
remarkably
close,
if
not
identical,
to
the
exception
that
you
want
us
to
find
as
a
way
to
resolve
the
ambiguity,
and
yet
that
was
repealed.
and
doesn't
the
repeal
of
that
language,
which
referred
to
lawyers
acting
as
attorneys,
cut
against
you
and
resolve
the
very
ambiguity
that
you
raise?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
is
to
say
they
took
on
a
lot
of
clients
who
had
debts,
and
they
specialized
in
debt
collection.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
were
still
representing
clients,
weren't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
they
were
doing
just
what
the
exception
says
would
not
bring
them
subject
to
the
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that
were
the
case,
i
don't
know
why
it
was
necessary,
because
the
exception
read,
"an
attorney
collecting
a
debt
as
an
attorney.
"
that
is
to
say,
i
suppose,
exercising
those
peculiar
functions
and
powers
that
lawyers,
as
attorneys,
may
exercise,
and
if
congress
meant
nothing
more
than
you
say
it
meant,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
attorneys,
to
the
extent
that
they
were
doing
something
which
was
not
peculiar
to
their
profession,
would
have
been
covered
by
the
statute
anyway,
so
it
wouldn't
have
been
necessary
to
repeal
the
exception.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about...
and
i
don't
want
to
cut
you
off
from
getting
into
that,
but
how
about
a...
just
a
comment
on
the
text
of
the
exception
itself.
the
exception
was
limited
to
the
exercise
of
functions
as
an
attorney,
i.e.,
functions
which
any
debt
collector
in
general
would
not
have
been
able
to
exercise.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
isn't
that
what
the
text
says?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you
say
that,
you've
got
to
explain
why
the
text
read
the
way
it
did,
and
i
haven't
heard
that
explanation
yet.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
explains
why
they
later
perhaps
wanted
to
broaden
the
coverage
of
the
act,
but
it
doesn't
explain
why
they
seemed,
in
the
exception,
to
want
to
limit
the
exception
by
that
phrase,
which
i
assume
has
some
meaning,
"as
an
attorney".
why
did
they
put
that
limitation
in
there,
if
you're
going
to
accept
justice
scalia's
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
want
in...
if
i
understand
it,
your
exception
is
an
exception
for
lawyers
who
are
acting
in
the
exercise
of
their
peculiar
functions
as
attorneys,
as
distinct
from
the
functions
that
any
debt
collector
could
perform.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
you've
just
repealed
the
repealer.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
you
explain
example
2,
maybe,
because
i
thought
in
example
2
there
was
a
lawyer-client
relationship,
and
yet
the
lawyer
was
not
acting
in
any
function,
or
performing
any
function
peculiar
to
lawyers,
so
the
relationship
seems
to
be
an
empty
one,
because
he's
doing
the
same
things,
and
only
those
things,
that
he
was
doing
under
example
1,
isn't
that
correct?
and
if
that
is
correct,
then
what
we're
left
with
is
the
preservation
of
a
lawyer
exception,
i.e.,
example
3,
which
seems
to
be
the
same
exception
that
was
in
the
old
exception
that
was
repealed.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
event,
he's
not
in
any
tougher
position
than
the
nonlawyer.
