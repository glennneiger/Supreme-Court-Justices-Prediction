well,
the--
--do
you
draw
a
complaint
line,
then,
so
that
a
letter
written
the
day
before
the
complaint
is
filed
would
be
covered,
on
your
analysis,
but
a
letter
written
the
day
after
would
not
be?
because
anybody
could
write
a
letter,
doesn't
have
to
be
licensed
to
be
a
lawyer,
the
day
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
do
you
draw
the
complaint
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
spellmire,
what
do
we
make
of
the
express
exceptions
that
congress
did
put
in,
at
least
one?
they
took
out
a
litigation-connected
activity,
process-serving,
and
they
said
that
that
doesn't
apply,
that
the
act
will
not
apply
to
the...
to
process-serving,
so...
but
they
didn't
say,
it
doesn't
apply
to
other
things
connected
with
litigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
says
only
one
function.
there
are
many
things
that
go
on
in
a
litigation
after
process
is
served.
doesn't
it
imply
that
since
they
made
an
exception
for
that,
they
didn't
mean
to
make
an
exception
for
anything
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about...
wasn't
it
the
aba
that
took
the
position
in
this
case
that
if
we
read
the
statute
the
way
you're
suggesting,
then
we're
driving
clients
to
the
most
incompetent,
most
inexperienced
lawyers,
because
they
won't
be
debt
collectors
because
they're
not
regularly
engaged
in
the
collection
of
debts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
like
a
dog
is
allowed
one
free
bite?
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
billboards.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
your
answer
specifically
to
the
argument
that
this
will
chill
full
adversarial
zeal,
the
best
representation
of
the
client,
because
the
attorney
will
be
intimidated
by
the
prospect
of
liability,
so
will
hold
back
arguments
that
might
be
tenable,
but
that
ultimately
fail?
