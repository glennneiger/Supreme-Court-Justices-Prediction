i
thought
perhaps
the
reason
for
the
use
of
the
word
prospectus
is
it's
a
term
of
art,
which
is
as
broad
as
you
say
but
also
encompasses
(a)
and
(b),
which
are
exceptions,
in
2(10).
you
know,
it
defines
prospectus
as
any
prospectus,
notice,
circular,
advertisement,
letter,
or
communication,
but
then
it
specifically
says,
by
the
way,
two
things
are
not
prospectuses,
and
that's
if
you
comply
with
certain
sec
rules
and
so
forth,
so
the
reason
that
they
wouldn't
say,
any
written
communication,
is
they
wanted
to
tie
it
directly
to
that
definition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
it
wouldn't
have
had
the
two
exceptions,
(a)
and
(b).
if
they
said,
any
written
communication,
it
wouldn't
pick
up
the
two
exceptions,
which
are
not
relevant
here,
because...
i
might
be
not
right
about
that,
but
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--2(10)
defines
prospect,
and
then
says...
very
broadly,
and
then
says,
except
that...
except
that
a
communication
sent
or
given,
and
so
forth,
then
it
says,
and
a
notice,
circular,
shall
not
be
deemed
a
prospectus
if,
you
know,
that
stuff.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
but
you
see,
my
question
is,
you're
argument
depends
on
well,
if
they
meant
any
written
communication,
why
didn't
they
just
say
it,
and
one
possible
reason
they
didn't
just
say
it
is
because
they
wanted
to
use
the
word
prospectus,
which
would
then
have
the
technical
exceptions
written
into
it.
that
was
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes...
all
right.
