well,
mr.
jenkins,
i
guess
the
problem
is
that
the
language
of
the
section
12(2)
does
say
that
any
person
who
offers
or
sells
a
security
by
means
of
a
prospectus
or
oral
communication
which
includes
an
untrue
statement
is
liable,
so
the
language
itself,
of
course,
is
broad,
as
you
have
to
concede.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
it
your
position
that
the
word
prospectus
includes
only
transactions
required
to
be
registered--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
section
5?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kopecky,
if
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
prevails,
wouldn't
it
virtually
swallow
up
any
10(b)-5
causes
of
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
where
a
10(b)-5
action
would
also
lie,
or
a
plaintiff
such
as
you
represent,
your
preferred
route
would
be
section
12(2)
i
assume
because
of
its
attorneys'
fees
and
lesser
requirements
for
proof.
