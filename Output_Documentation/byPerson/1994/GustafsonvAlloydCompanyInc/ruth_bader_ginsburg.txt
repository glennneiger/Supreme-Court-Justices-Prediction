if
it
had
been
an
offering
circular...
not
just
a
purchase
agreement,
but
would
an
offering
circular
fit
within
the
definition
of
section
2(10)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
it's
in
connection
with
a
private
offering,
it
would
not...
is
that
what
you're
saying
would
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
2(10)
just
says,
offers
any
security
for
sale.
it
doesn't...
it's
not...
the
words
of
the
statute
aren't
limited
to
a
public
offering.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
that
limitation
used?
i
mean,
suppose
you
had
what
might
be
called
an
offering
circular
in
connection
with
this
private
offering,
but
it
was
labeled,
prospectus.
would
it
then
fit
within
the
definition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
this
deal
has...
no,
it
would
still
be...
well,
if
this
deal
had
been
done
with
the
company,
the
control
company
issuing
new
shares,
and
then
gustafson
redeeming
the
shares
that
they
had
originally,
then
that...
otherwise
everything
is
the
same.
that
would
be
covered,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
the
buyers
got
new
shares,
and
then
the
sellers
redeemed
their
old
shares.
i
don't
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
then
you
would
have
to
make
your
distinction
turn
on
the
actions
of
a
public
offering,
not
on
the
sale
versus
resale.
in
other
words--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
gave
you
a
situation
where
you
end
up
with
the
same
result,
but
in
one
case
it's
done
in
the
form
of
a
sale
of
new
shares,
redemption
of
old
shares,
in
the
other
it's
done
in
the
form
of
just
a
direct
sale
of
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
i'm
giving
you
two
ways
of
doing
essentially
the
same
deal.
one,
it
would
involve
a
resale,
and
the
other
would
be
a
first
sale,
and
wholly
apart
from
the
private
versus
public
sale,
i
think
you
said
resales
are
never
included.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of
the
briefs
in
support
of
respondents
said...
discussed
section
410(a)(2)
of
the
uniform
securities
act,
said
it
was
similar
to
12(2),
and
said
that
the
consensus
among
the
states
is
contrary
to
your
position.
the
consensus
is
that
both
private
sales
and
secondary
market
transactions
are
covered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
just
said
section
17--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
if
17
is
not
so
limiting,
well
then,
12(2)
could
be
not
so
limiting.
