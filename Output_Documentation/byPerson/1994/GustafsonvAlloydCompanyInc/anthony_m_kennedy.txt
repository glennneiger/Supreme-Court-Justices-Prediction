does
that
silence
suggest
that
section
12
applies
to
transactions
that
do
not
have
to
be
registered?
justice
anthony
m.

--mr.
jenkins--
--if
i
could
ask
you
one
question...
excuse
me,
chief
justice.
the
brief
of
the
amicus
for
the
securities
industry
association
says
that
research
reports
would
be
covered
if
we
were
to
rule
against
you
in
favor
of
the
respondent,
and
tells
us
the
adverse
consequences
of
that.
do
you
agree
with
their
theory
in
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
question
is,
what
is
a
selling
document?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
this
case
arises
under
the
securities
act
of
1933.
that
act
regulates
the
sale
and
the
issuance
of
new
securities
that
provides
a
registration
of
the
securities.
it
also
provides
a
number
of
different
remedies
for
persons
who
are
injured
by
violation
of
the
act,
and
whether
remedies
has
the
right
to
rescind,
the
right
to
undo
a
transaction
after
it
has
been
completed
and
that’s
contained
in
section
12(2)
of
the
act,
and
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
this
rescission
remedy
applies
to
a
private
secondary
transaction
as
well
as
to
publicly
traded
issues
and
public
transactions.
the
right
of
rescission
as
provided
in
the
statute
is
a
very
sweeping
remedy.
it
provides
that
a
purchaser
may
rescind,
if
the
purchaser
finds
that
the
prospectus
that
a
company,
the
sale
of
the
securities
contain
a
misstatement
or
an
omission.
it’s
a
sweeping
remedy
because
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
seller
need
not
be
shown;
no
need
the
purchaser
show
reliance.
the
right
of
rescission
applies
even
though
a
purchaser
did
not
rely
on
the
particular
misstatement,
even
though
he
did
not
rely
on
the
perspectives.
this
case
involved
the
sale
of
securities
in
a
secondary
private
transaction
in
an
illinois
transaction.
the
private
company
sold
its
stock
the
purchaser’s
were
called
the
alloyd
company
that
was
actually
the
name
of
the
old
company
and
was
also
the
name
of
the
new
purchasing
company.
the
sellers
were
called
gustafson.
the
parties
had
a
contract
which
contains
certain
recitals
with
reference
to
the
financial
condition
of
the
company.
after
the
contract
was
closed
and
the
shares
had
been
transferred,
it
was
alleged
that
one
of
these
recitals
was
a
misstatement
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
right
of
rescission
applies
to
this
private
transaction.
there
are
two
different
views
in
the
circuits.
the
third
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
disagree;
we
took
this
case
from
the
seventh
circuit.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
which
held
that
this
was
a
prospectus.
we
find
that
section
12(2)
applies
only
where
the
seller
has
made
material
misstatements
by
means
of
prospectus
and
conclude
that
the
word
prospectus
is
a
term
of
art
referring
to
a
document
that
describes
a
public
offering
of
securities
by
an
issuer
or
a
controlling
shareholder.
the
parties
agreed
that
prospectus
has
this
meaning
under
section
10
of
the
act
which
governs
the
information
required
to
be
contain
in
a
prospectus.
in
our
view
the
term
has
the
same
meaning
throughout
the
act,
and
so
we
find
that
the
definition
is
controlling
under
section
12(2).
all
over
the
term
prospectus
is
defined
to
include
a
written
communication
that
offers
a
security
for
sale.
we
read
in
context
the
term
communication
as
referring
to
a
public
offer.
the
contract
of
sale
here
and
its
recitations
were
not
held
out
to
the
public
and
were
not
a
prospectus
as
determine
as
used
in
the
1933
act.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia,
ginsburg,
and
breyer
joined.
justice
ginsburg
has
field
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer
joins.
