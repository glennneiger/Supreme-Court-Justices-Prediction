very
well,
mr.

mr.

we'll

from

mr.
kopecky,
in
2(10),
after
it
says,
the
term
prospectus
means
any
prospectus,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
which
offers
any
security
for
sale,
now,
would
you
say
that
an,
simply
an
agreement
of
sale
signed
by
both
parties
is
always
something
which
offers
a
security
for
sale?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
there
had
been
no
representations
in
the
agreement,
then
perhaps
it
would
not
be
a
prospectus?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jenkins.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
93-404
gustafson
against
alloyd
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
