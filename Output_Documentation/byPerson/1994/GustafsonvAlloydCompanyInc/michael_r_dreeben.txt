mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
our
view,
the
cause
of
action
provided
in
section
12(2)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
does
extend
to
all
sales
of
securities
made
by
means
of
a
prospectus
or
oral
communication
that
contains
a
misleading
statement,
and
there
is
no
limitation
to
initial
offerings,
initial
public
offerings,
or
an
exclusion
of
private
transactions
or
secondary
transactions.
the
key
in
construing
section
12(2)
is
the
phrase,
prospectus
or
oral
communication,
which
is
a
defined
term
in
the
act,
and
when
one
looks
at
the
definition
in
section
2(10)
of
the
prospectus,
it's
fairly
clear
that
congress
used
words
that
cover
a
very,
very
broad
range
of
kinds
of
communications
that
offer
a
security
for
sale
or
confirm
the
sale
of
a
security.
and
as
my
cocounsel
alluded
to,
the
origins
of
the
statutory
definition
of
prospectus
are
very
revealing,
because
they
show
that
the
first
four
terms
in
that
definition
are
the
same
that
appear
in
the
british
companies
act,
and
there
is
evidence
from
the
people
who
wrote
this
act
that
they
used
the
british
companies
act
as
a
model.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
for
most
of
section
10,
that
is
true.
section
10
is
by
and
large
concerned
with
the
kind
of
formal
prospectus
that's
included
with
a
registration
statement.
there
is
also
authority
for
the
commission
later
in
section
10
to
classify
various
prospectuses
according
to
type,
and
that
is
not
a
limitation
that
would
necessarily
apply
to
prospectuses
filed
in
a
registration
statement.
but
i
think
the
most
important
point
here
is
that
the
structure
of
the
acts,
the
securities
laws
as
a
whole,
reflects
that
congress
understood
the
difference
between
the
broad
definition
in
section
2(10)
and
the
narrower
association
of
prospectus
used
in
a
registration
statement.
in
the
investment
companies
act
of
1940,
congress
included
a
definition
of
prospectus
that
says,
prospectus
for
certain
sections
of
the
act
means
the
prospectus
that
is
described
in
section
10
of
the
securities
act
of
1933.
elsewhere,
it
has
the
definition
that
is
contained
in
section
2(10)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933.
so
congress
itself
was
fully
capable
of
drawing
that
distinction,
and
the
act
itself
invites
courts
to
draw
appropriate
distinctions
in--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
is
no
one,
unqualified
answer
to
that,
justice
o'connor.
the
question
would
be,
is
the
research
report
being
used
as
a
selling
tool
by
the
broker?
if
the
broker
is
using
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
in
that
context,
justice
o'connor,
a
research
report
would
be
the
kind
of
document
that's
picked
up
by
the
language,
and
the
application
of
section
2,
12(2)
would
be
justified
in
light
of
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
to
the
extent
that
they
are
used
in
a
situation
that
one
can
conclude,
justice
kennedy,
that
they
are
offering
a
security
for
sale.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
stevens,
they
don't,
because
the
requirement
that
would
attach
under
12(2)
is
not
a
requirement
of
affirmative
disclosure.
the
only
requirement
that's
imposed
by
virtue
of
12(2)
is
that
the
research
report
not
contain
false
or
misleading
statements,
and
misleading
statements
in
this
context
means
an
omission
which
makes
the
statements
that
are
made
misleading.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
but
the
question
that
i
thought
you
were
asking,
justice
stevens,
is
whether
there
was
a
laundry
list
of
things
that
had
to
be
included
in
a
research
report
analogous
to
the
kinds
of
things
that
are
required
to
be
included
in
a
registered
public
offering.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
would
have
a...
it
would
have
the
same
standard
of
care
under
section
12(2).
of
course,
under
section
11
of
the
securities
act,
a
registered
offering
would
subject
the
issuer
to
strict
liability
for--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--misstatements,
and
the
persons
who
signed
the
registration
statement
would
also
have
a
very
high
duty
of
care.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
british
companies
act
only
applies
to
initial
public
offerings.
it
doesn't
regulate
any
secondary
transactions,
and
it
doesn't
regulate
private
transactions.
and
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
about
the
comparison
between
the
language
is
that
the
british
companies
act
quite
deliberately
included
the
word,
prospective
circular,
et
cetera,
and
then
said,
in
offering
of
securities
to
the
public,
and
the
securities
act
drafters
dropped
that
language
and
substituted
in
the
words,
which
offers
any
security
for
sale,
which
really
expresses
a
quite
different
and
deliberately
broader
connotation.
and
when
picked
up
in
12(2),
i
think
as
justice
ginsburg
indicated,
you
can
have
offering
circulars
that
are
used
in
private
placements,
private
transactions.
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
quite
clearly
applies
to
seller
misstatements
in
the
context
of
those
transactions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
in
the
sense
of
chevron,
justice
o'connor.
we're
not
asking
for
deference
in
that
sense,
but
we
do
think
that
it
is
extraordinarily
revealing
and
very
important
to
the
construction
of
12(2)
that
at
the
time
that
this
statute
was
passed,
the
administrators
who
were
responsible
for
its
implementation,
which
was
the
federal
trade
commission,
issued
releases
that
quite
clearly
said
that
the
act
in
the
main
applies
to
new
public
offerings,
but
note,
industry,
that
section
17
and
section
12(2)
apply
also
to
old
securities
which
exist
in
the
marketplace
already.
section
17,
of
course,
is
the
remedy
that
the
government
has
available
against
fraud.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
true,
but
the...
in
addition
to
the
interpretations
by
the
federal
trade
commission
there
were
also
a
raft
of
articles
that
were
written
at
the
time,
or
around
the
time,
by
such
people
as
william
o.
douglas
and
felix
frankfurter...
felix
frankfurter
was
at
the
time
very
heavily
involved
in
the
drafting
process...
and
those
articles
asserted
without
qualification
that
section
12(2)
applied
to
any
sale
of
securities
and
wanted
to
educate
the
investment
community
that
was
concerned
with
this
that
that
was
true.
this
understanding
continued
not
only
immediately
after
the
'33
act
was
passed
but
for
decades,
until
the
late
1980's.
there
was
very
significant
work
trying
to
revise
the
act
in
1940,
in
which
the
industry
and
the
commission
together
met,
and
everybody
understood
and
expressed
in
written
documents
that
section
12(2)
applies
to
a
really
broad
range
of
transactions,
it
doesn't
distinguish
among
the
various
types,
it
doesn't
distinguish
broker
transactions
from
initial
public
offerings,
and
it
should,
and
recommendations
were
made
to
congress
to
amend
it,
and
then
world
war
ii
came
along
and
those
amendments
were
not
acted
upon.
but
the
revealing
thing
here
is
that
these
very
knowledgeable
practitioners,
who
had
every
reason
to
understand--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i...
the...
probably
the
principal
explanation
in
years
up
until
the
late
1980's
was
the
existence
of
rule
10(b)-5
and
causes
of
action
under
it,
which
had
really
swamped
the
area,
and
so
litigation
under
12(2)
certainly
did
increase
as
the
statute
of
limitations
for
rule
10(b)-5
was
held
to
be
shorter
and
scienter
requirements
were
imposed,
but
it
is
a
very
significant
point,
justice
stevens,
that
rule
10(b)-5
did
not
exist
when
the
'34
acts
were
enacted.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
sure.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
question
has
not
been
definitively
decided
in
the
courts.
the
weight
of
the
view
of
commentators
is
that
the
exceptions
that
are
contained
in
section
2(1)
do
not
apply
to
the
remedy
that's
provided
in
section
12(2).
there
are
several
reasons
for
that,
and
there
is
a
statutory
argument
that
supports
it.
the
first
reason
is
that
there
is
an
unequivocal
statement
in
the
house
report
that
assumed
that
freewriting,
oral
communications
made
in
the
sale
of
securities
are
absolutely
covered
by
section
12(2)
whether
or
not
a
prospectus
has
been
delivered.
there
was
no
sort
of
free
zone
for
fraud
in
that
area.
and
the
statute
allows
you
to
reach
that
result
because
it
introduces
all
of
its
definitions--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
true.
the
legislative
history
doesn't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
reason
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
reason
is
that
the
result
would
be
that
you
would
have
a
free
zone
for
fraud
or
misstatements
so
long
as
you
provided
a
copy
of
the
written
prospectus,
and
commentators
have
viewed
that
as
an
implausible
result
and
one
that
is
contrary
to
the
direct
evidence
of
legislative
intent.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you.
