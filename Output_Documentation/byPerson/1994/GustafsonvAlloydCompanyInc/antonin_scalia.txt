yes,
but
you--
--that's
all
it
needs,
just
a
couple
of
congressmen
to
say...
it's
not
even
in
the
committee
report,
just
a
couple
of
congressmen
say
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
is
enough
to
interrupt
the
act
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then,
having
defined
prospectus
in
a
way
that's
contrary
to
the
definition
in
the
statute,
you
define
oral
communication
the
same
way,
by
sort
of
guilt
by
association,
right?
it
does
say,
prospectus
or
oral
communication.
how
do
you
get
oral
communication
to
mean
something
less
than
an
oral
communication?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
want
to
talk
about
what
would
have
been
an
easier
way
to
say
it.
i
mean,
you've
made
allusions
to
that
several
times.
i
find
it
very
odd
that
the
limitation
that
you're
seeking
to
import
into
the
statute
would
be
imported
by
the
word
prospectus,
rather
than
by
the
word
sale.
i
mean,
that
limitation,
it
would
have
been
way
up
at
the
top
of
section
12,
any
person
who
publicly
offers
or
sells
a
security,
or
offers
or
sells
to
the
public
a
security.
why
would
you
seek
to
import
that
limitation,
it
has
to
be
a
public
offering
or
sale,
much
later
in
the
provision?
why
all
the
way
down,
by
saying,
who
offers
or
sells
by
means
of
a
prospectus,
aha,
prospectus
must
mean
a
public
offering.
it's
a
very
strange
way
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
simply
say,
public
offering
or
sale.
