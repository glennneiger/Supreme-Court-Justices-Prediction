justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
it,
you
don't
rely
at
all
on
the
distinction
between
a
sale
and
a
resale,
do
you?
you
rely
on
the
distinction
between
public
offerings
or
nonpublic
offerings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
wouldn't
contend
that
a
secondary
offering...
say
i'm
a
major
shareholder
of
general
motors.
i
have
a
public
offering
of
my
stock.
you'd
admit
that's
covered,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course.
i'm
just
saying
that
there
are
some
secondary
offerings
that
must
be
registered,
so
there
is
no
basis
in
the
statute
for
drawing
a
distinction
simply
about
whether
it's
a
primary
offering
or
secondary
offering.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
nothing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
following
up
on
justice
scalia's
question,
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
term,
public
offering,
is
not
defined
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
rather,
what
they
do,
they
talk...
use
the
broad
term,
sale,
and
then
list
a
series
of
exemptions
from
the
registration
requirement,
and
anything--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
nonexempt
therefore
becomes
public
in
the
way
we
use
the
term.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
take
a
very
simple
agreement
in
which
the
seller
represents
that
he
or
she
is
the
owner
of
the
stock.
the
only
representation
says,
i,
as
the
owner,
hereby
offer
the
following
stock,
you
describe
it,
you
send
it
in
the
mail,
it
said
if
you
want
to
buy
it,
sign
here.
that
would
be
a
prospectus,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
could,
have
very
simple
transactions
would
be
covered
by
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
could
be
true,
just
five
shares
of
stock.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
it
has
to
be
something--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that,
he
in
fact
didn't
own
three
of
the
shares
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
would
be
federal
jurisdiction,
to
resolve
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
british
companies
act,
would
there
be
a
remedy
such
as
this,
for
this
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
this
issue
been
litigated
over
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
you
brought
up
the
british
companies
act.
