unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn't--
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
--unless
they're
public
offerings.
unknown
speaker
nothing
to
do
with--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
section
4
exempts
certain
transactions
from
section
5,
but
not
from
section
12.
unknown
speaker
the
point
is
that
the
style
of
the
act
does
use
exemptions
in
section
4,
exempting
one
section
from
another.
unknown
speaker
you
were
saying,
the
heart
of
the
act--
unknown
speaker
right.
i--
unknown
speaker
--excuse
me.
i
thought
negligence
was
not
required
under
section
12.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
affirmative.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
how
would
you
answer
justice
kennedy's
question
that
was
brought
up
in
the
sia
brief,
the
question
of
the
research
reports
done
by
a
brokerage
firm?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
that
prospectus
is
defined
as
a
document
that
offers
or
confirms
the
sale
of
a
security?
where
do
you...
i
thought
it
means...
i
thought
part
of
your
case
was
precisely
that
it
means
any
notice
circular,
not
just,
it
means
any
prospectus,
notice,
circular,
advertisement,
letter
or
communication
written--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see,
which
offers--
unknown
speaker
--which
offers
any
security
for
sale.
unknown
speaker
that's...
although
my
thought
favored
you,
i
hope
you'll
disabuse
me
of
it
if
it's
not
correct,
as
i'll
just
get
mixed
up
if
it
is,
but
i
thought
the
reason
they
used
the
word
prospectus
instead
of
any
written
communication
is
because
they
wanted
to
pick
up
that
particular
definition
with
its
limitations,
and
the
limitations
are
two
you
just
mentioned,
plus
the
fact
that
a
written
prospectus,
a
written
communication
is
not
a
prospectus
if
a
registration
statement
has
been
filed
previously
and
certain
things
have
been
done.
unknown
speaker
and
they
wanted
to
build
that
all
in--
unknown
speaker
--which
the
word
written
communication
couldn't
have
done.
am
i
on
a
correct
track?
unknown
speaker
fine.
then
why
didn't
they
use
the
word
oral
communication
next,
because
oral
communication
doesn't
have
those
limitations?
unknown
speaker
that
cuts
off
my
thought,
because
i
can't
get
it
to
work
with
oral
communication.
unknown
speaker
a
prospectus
has
to
be
related
to
the
registration
statement,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
section
10
required
that.
unknown
speaker
but
section
10
doesn't
say,
some
prospectuses,
it
says
all,
so
i
had
thought,
unless--
unknown
speaker
--qualifications.
unknown
speaker
so
then
you
can
limit
the
term,
prospectus,
in
section
10
at
least
by
reference
to
other
provisions
of
the
act.
unknown
speaker
are
punitive
damages
available
in
this
sort
of
a
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
are
punitive
damages
available
under
a
10(b)-5
action?
unknown
speaker
does...
justice
breyer
asked
you
whether
one
aspect
of
the
definition
of
prospectus
is
carried
over
into
the
phrase,
oral
communication.
what
about
the
aspect
that
requires
a
prospectus
to
be
in
connection
with
the
offer
to
sell,
in
connection
with
the
offer
or
confirmation
of
sale?
is
oral
statement
in
section
12
limited
to
that
as
well?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
one
of
the
major
purposes
congress
had
in
mind
was
to
eliminate
the
statute
of
frauds
from
these
transactions?
unknown
speaker
i
don't,
either.
unknown
speaker
it
surely
wasn't
primarily
concerned
with
oral
communications.
unknown
speaker
is
it
fair
to
say,
though,
that
the
1933
securities
act
was
really
an
act
that
concerned
initial
public
offerings,
and
that
the
'34
act
generally
addressed
private
and
secondary
trading?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
isn't
that
the
general
thrust?
unknown
speaker
and
so
this
interpretation
of
12(2)
doesn't
fit
exactly
with
that
general
thrust.
unknown
speaker
could
you
have
brought
a
10(b)-5
action?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
a
good
example.
unknown
speaker
and
put
us
in
the
same
boat
we
are
with
all
those
unpleasant
rico
cases.
unknown
speaker
maybe
that's
because
of
our
more
recent
holding
here
as
to
the
scienter
requirement
under
10(b)-5.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
kopecky.
mr.
dreeben.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
how
do
you
answer
justice
kennedy's
question
about
section
10,
which
uses
the
word,
a
prospectus,
but
that
is
definitely
the
kind
of
prospectus
that
would
be
part
of
a
registration
statement?
there,
the
word
prospectus
does
have
a
circumscribed
meaning.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
dreeben,
speaking
of
distinctions,
what
would
you
do
about
research
reports
that
brokers
commonly
use
in
the
sale
of
securities?
unknown
speaker
broadly
speaking
how
could
it
not
be?
i
mean,
the
broker
says,
well,
here's
a
stock
to
consider
and
here's
our
research
report.
unknown
speaker
so
all
research
reports
sent
out
by
brokers
are
prospecti?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
they
have
the
same
high
standard
of
full
disclosure
that
the
prospectus
that
accompanies
the
normal
public
offering
has?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
same
standard
under
the
prospectus.
unknown
speaker
not
by...
itemized,
but
it
has
the
same
standard,
same
high
standard
of
care.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
since
i
interrupted
you,
do
you
know
the
answer
to
my
question
about
the
british
companies
act?
how
did
the
english
treat
this?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
do
we
owe
any
deference
to
the
sec
interpretation
of
these
sections?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
just
affect
the
distinction
between
initial
and
secondary,
not
necessarily
between
public
and
private.
unknown
speaker
the
one
question
that
prompts
us,
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
there
have
been
so
very
few
cases
like
this?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
a
quick
question
about
the
research
reports?
unknown
speaker
a
research
report
is
this,
would
perhaps
be,
you
offer
something
for
sale,
you
include
a
research
report,
it
would
be
picked
up.
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
you
could
get
out
of
that
if
in
fact
you
had
enclosed
as
well
a
prospectus
that
had
met
the
sec's
registration
requirement
because
of
the
exception
in
(a).
is
that
right,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
because
it's
oral,
freewriting
oral.
oral
isn't
picked
up
with
the
definition
of
prospectus.
prospectus
picks
up
the
written
part.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
reason
(a)
and
(b)
don't
apply?
unknown
speaker
to
a
written...
to
a
written.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jenkins,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
about
commentators
named
frankfurter
and
douglas?
unknown
speaker
--the
british
act
which
did
include
an
express
limitation
to
public
offerings?
unknown
speaker
you
rely
on
using
the
same
litany
of
prospectus,
notice,
circular,
et
cetera,
but
then
say,
well,
it's
all
right
for
them
to
have
skipped
out
the
other
part,
that
they
didn't
copy
the
british
wording
to
that
extent.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10
o
'clock.
