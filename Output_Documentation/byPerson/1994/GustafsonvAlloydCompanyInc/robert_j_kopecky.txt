mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
we
begin
with
the
presumption
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
reflects
congress'
intent.
here,
neither
the
text
of
section
12(2)
nor
the
structure
of
the
act
as
a
whole
supports
imposing
upon
section
12(2)
the
limitations
that
petitioners
ask
this
court
to
read
into
that
express
civil
remedy.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
i'm
not
sure
an
agreement,
per
se,
would
always
offer
a
security
for
sale.
i
think
in
this
case
the
agreement
clearly
did.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
well,
the
agreement
here
was
the
culmination
of
a
long
process.
the
agreement
included
specifically
representations
by
the
sellers
that
were
made
as
an
inducement,
and
that's
in
the
language
of
the
agreement
itself,
as
an
inducement
to
the
buyers
to
buy
the
stock,
so
the
agreement
itself
was
part
of
the
selling
process.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
i
think
perhaps
it
would
not
be.
section
12(2)
reaches
those
communications
that
convey
information
to
the
buyer
about
some
security.
if
there's
no
representation
being
made,
then
i'm
not
sure
how
you
would
ever
have
a
cause
of
action
under
section
12(2).
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
in
my
view,
it
would,
because
in
that
case
there
would
be
a
representation
being
made
about
the
security.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
it
is
conceivable
that--
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
--of
course,
you
would
have
to
prove
that
the
person
who
made
that
statement
was
negligent.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
right.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
if
you
use
the
jurisdictional
means--
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
--i
would
agree--
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
--it
is,
your
honor.
it
is.
it's
an
affirmative
defense.
the
seller
is
required
to
prove
that
he
was
not
negligent,
but
if
he
can
prove
that
he
was
not
negligent,
there
is
no
liability
under
the
statute.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
but
it
is
commonly
referred
to
as
a
negligencebased
liability.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
not
at
all,
your
honor.
the
scope
of
transactions
covered
by
section
12(2)
is
a
very
small
subset
of
those
now
covered
by
10(b)-5,
in
this
respect,
10(b)-5
covers
any
statement
or
omission
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
the
securities.
it
doesn't
require
that
there
be
a
buyerseller
relationship
between
the
parties.
most
10(b)-5
actions,
and
most
class
actions
under
10(b)-5,
are
brought
in
the
context
of
statements
by
issuers
that
then
get
relied
upon
by
the
market
or
by
some
buyer
who
bought
his
stock
from
somebody
else,
not
from
the
issuer.
that
is
the
vast
majority
of
10(b)-5
cases.
those
would
be
unaffected
by
this
case,
because
section
12(2)
simply
doesn't
reach
them.
section
12(2)
requires
privity
between
a
buyer
and
a
seller.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
the
attorneys'
fees
would
be
hard
for
the
plaintiff
to
get
in
this
case,
so
i
don't
think
that's
a
motivating
factor.
the
negligence
standard
is
obviously
a
benefit,
so
it
is
true
that
in
those
categories
of
cases
where
there's
an
overlap
between
section
12(2)
and
10(b)-5,
a
plaintiff
would
prefer
to
sue
under
12(2),
just
as
in
the
context
of
a
registered
public
offering
of
securities,
if
there's
a
misstatement
in
the
registration
statement,
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
would
much
prefer
to
sue
under
section
11
of
the
'33
act,
which
has
no
scienter
requirement
whatsoever,
than
under
10(b)-5,
where
he
would
have
to
prove
fraud.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
the
answer
to
that
question
is
not
clear
from
the
legislative
history,
so
i
can
only
speculate,
but
let
me
offer
a
couple
of
explanations.
one,
this
statute
was
basically
walking
into
new
territory.
there
had
not
been
significant
regulation
of
the
securities
industry.
i
think
it
is
reasonable
for
congress
to
have
started
with
some
terms
that
were
known
and
commonly
used,
prospectus,
circular,
notice,
and
then
worked
from
that
in
increasing
breadth,
ending
with
the
term,
written
communication.
could
they
have
simply
said
any
communication,
or
any
written
communication?
they
certainly
could
have.
i
think
a
second
explanation
is
that,
as
pointed
out
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
we
know
that
the
draftsmen
started
with
the
british
companies
act
as
a
model,
and
the
british
companies
act
has
a
definition
of
prospectus
that
starts
out
similarly
to
the
definition
of
this
case.
however,
in
this
case
the
drafters
diverted
significantly,
because
the
british
companies
act
referred
to
public
offerings
of
securities.
that
was
eliminated
from
the
definition
of
prospectus
by
the
congress
that
enacted
the
'33
act.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
under
the
british
companies
act...
well,
certainly
if
we
were
relying
on
a
prospectus
i
think
we'd
have
a
hard
time,
because
the
british
companies
act
defines
prospectus
to
include
a
public
offering,
so
i
think
we
would
have
a
harder
case.
i
do
not
have
clearly
in
mind
what
the
british
companies
act
says
about
oral
representations,
which
is
a
key
part
of
our
case
here,
so
i
don't
know
if
we
could
win
under
that
statute.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
your
honor,
i
confess
i
have
not
studied
that.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
a
fair--
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
--i
think
it
is
far
from
clear
that
brokerage
research
reports
would
be
subject
to
liability
under
section
12(2)
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first,
in
order
to
have
liability
under
section
12(2),
you
must
be
a
seller.
you
must
be
a
statutory
seller.
it's
unclear,
far
from
clear,
i
think,
that
someone
who
issues
a
research
report
is
a
seller.
in
pinter
v.
dahl,
this
court
explained
what
it
means
to
be
a
statutory
seller
under
section
12(1).
assume
for
a
minute
that
definition
extends
to
12(2).
you
must
either
be
the
person
who
passes
title
to
the
security,
or
one
who
solicits
the
sale
for
your
own
financial
benefit,
so
someone
who
issues
an
analyst's
report
is
not
necessarily
soliciting
anybody
to
buy
stock.
second,
the
analyst's
report
itself
would
have
to
be
a
prospectus,
and
prospectus
is
defined
as
a
document
that
offers
or
confirms
the
sale
of
the
security.
now,
an
analyst's
report
does
not
offer
a
security
for
sale,
nor
does
it
confirm
the
sale
of
the
security,
so
i
think
the
concerns
about
openended
liability
for
analysts
is
significantly
overblown.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
that
offers...
any
of
those
that
offers--
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
--any
security
for
sale--
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
--right.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
right.
right,
exactly.
that's
the
end
of
the
definition.
all
of
those
things,
any
of
them
have
to
offer
the
security
for
sale,
or
they're
not
covered.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
i--
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
--i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
again,
the
legislative
history
doesn't
enlighten
us
much
on
why
they
used
oral
communication.
i
believe
what
congress
was
getting
at
in
enacting
the
statute
was
the
process
by
which
owners
of
securities
solicit
people
to
buy
those
shares
from
them,
and
there
are
two
ways
you
can
do
that.
you
can
do
it
in
writing,
or
you
can
do
it
orally.
if
the
question
is,
why
didn't
they
subject
oral
communications
to
the
freewriting
exception,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
i
understand,
and
i'm
not
sure
the
logic
of
all
that
hangs
together,
and
there's
been
a
lot
of
question
raised
about
exactly
what
the
freewriting
exemption
is
meant
to
accomplish
and
why
it
was
there,
so
i
can't
answer
how
the
oral
communication
precisely
fits
into
that
exception
from
the
definition
of
prospectus.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
no.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
section
10
requires
what
has
to
be
in
a
prospectus
that
is
issued
in
conjunction
with
a
registered
offering
of
securities.
if
you
have
a
registered
offering,
the
act
requires
you
to
provide
certain
information
to
the
sec
in
your
registration
statement.
it
also
requires
you
to
provide
certain
information
to
investors
in
the
prospectus
that's
issued
with
that
registration
statement,
but
those
requirements,
the
strict,
detailed
requirements
of
section
10,
apply
only
to
prospectuses
issued
in
connection
with
registered
offerings
of
securities.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
i
think
where
that--
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
--i
think
that
comes
out
of
section
5,
your
honor.
section
5
makes
it
unlawful
to
sell
any
securities
that
have
been
registered
unless
you
comply
with
the
provisions
of
section
10,
so
section
10
only--
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
--i
believe...
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
meaning
of
section...
of
prospectus
in
section
10
is
defined
by
its
context,
which
is
in
reference
back
to
registered
offering
under
section
5.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
that
has
upheld
punitive
damages.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
let
me
return,
if
i
could,
to
what
i
think
are
the
key
points
in
our
argument
today.
one
is
that
the
language
of
section
12(2)
simply
does
not
expressly
impose
the
limitation
that
petitioners
are
asking
for.
second,
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
demonstrate
that
when
congress
meant
to
exempt
either
a
particular
type
of
transaction
or
particular
type
of
security
from
some
portion
of
the
act
it
did
so
explicitly,
and
we've
talked
about,
during
mr.
jenkins'
argument,
sections
4(2),
4(1),
which
create
express
exemptions
from
the
registration
requirement.
there's
no
comparable
exemption
from
section
12(2)
and,
further,
again
as
mr.
jenkins
pointed
out,
when
congress
meant
to
exempt
a
particular
type
of
security
from
section
12(2),
it
did
that
explicitly
as
well.
so
when
congress
meant
there
to
be
exemptions,
it
enacted
them.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
by
the
bymeansof
language
in
section
12(2).
i
think
to
say
that
a
particular
security
is
sold
by
means
of
either
a
written
or
oral
communication
means
that
that
statement
is
made
in
connection
with
the
solicitation
of
the
sale.
i
think
the
whole
purpose
of
section
12(2)
was
to
focus
in
on
that
process
by
which
sellers
solicit
buyers,
and
the
focus
of
the
bymeansof
clause
i
believe
is
to
hone
it
right
in
on
just
that,
those
statements,
whether
oral
or
written,
that
are
used
to
solicit
sales
of
securities.
i
want
to
return
to
just
one
other
point
in
the
text
of
section
12(2)
itself,
if
i
may,
and
that's
the
term,
oral
communication.
this
court
has
said
repeatedly,
and
most
recently
in
fdic
v.
meyer,
that
undefined
statutory
terms
are
to
be
given
their
ordinary,
or
natural
meaning.
now,
petitioners
cannot
dispute
that
giving
the
words
of
the
statute
their
ordinary
meaning,
section
12(2)
on
its
face
unambiguously
applies
to
any
security
sold
by
means
of
a
false
or
misleading
oral
communication.
there
simply
is
no
connotation
you
can
give
to
oral
communication
that
limits
it
to
a
public
offering
or
an
initial
offering
of
securities.
to
the
contrary,
an
oral
communication
is
going
to
occur
most
often
in
the
context
of
a
private
transaction,
a
negotiated
transaction
where
people
are
talking
to
each
other,
so
oral
communication,
it
seems,
if
you
read
it
just
in
its
natural
sense,
clearly
applies
to
all
transactions.
now,
they
say
you
can't
do
that.
you
have
to
look
to
prospectus
as
a
term
of
limitation
on
oral
communication.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
they're
asking
you
to
do
is
take
a
term
that
we
think
is
unambiguously
defined...
that
is,
prospectus...
find
some
ambiguity
in
that,
construe
it
narrowly,
and
then
use
that
to
narrow
a
clearly
broad
term.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
i
don't
think
that
was
a
major
purpose,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
i
think
the
major
purpose
congress
had
in
mind
was--
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
--i
don't
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
i
would
note
that
in
the
conference
report
on
the
bill,
in
discussing
section
12
in
particular,
and
this
is
one
of
the
few
places
we
have
any
reference
to
section
12
in
the
legislative
history,
in
paraphrasing
section
12,
the
conference
committee
said
that
this
bill
reaches
the
sales
of
securities
by
means
of
representations
which
are
untrue
or
misleading.
that's
a
very
broad
term,
representations
which
are
untrue
or
misleading.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
i
think
as
a--
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
--as
a
generality,
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i'd
like
to
respond
to
that
in
a
couple
of
ways.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
if
you're
going
to
limit
the
statute
by
the
primary
purpose
i
think
one
could
make
that
argument.
it
is
interesting
that
in
the
'34
act
there
was
no
express
right
of
action
created
that
would
cover
the
transaction
in
our
case,
so
i
think
that
suggests
just
the
contrary,
that
congress
thought
they
had
taken
care
of
that
in
1933.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
in
theory,
we
could.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
the
reason
we
didn't
allege
it
is
because
we
felt
we
didn't
have
a
rule
11
basis
for
asserting
fraud,
scienter,
and
so
we
brought
the
cause
of
action
we
felt
the
facts
supported.
let
me
return
to
the
question
about
primary
purpose.
i
think
the
situation
here
is
analogous
to
rico,
a
statute
this
court
has
construed
repeatedly
in
the
last
few
years.
you
can
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
rico,
and
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
what
motivated
rico,
the
primary
purpose,
was
to
seek
the
eradication
of
organized
crime
in
the
united
states,
and
yet
congress
wrote
the
statute
to
pick
up
persons
other
than
mobsters
or
organized
criminals.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
and
this
court
has
said,
we're
going
to
construe
rico
not
in
light
of
what
was
the
primary
motivation,
but
the
way
congress
wrote
the
statute,
and
i
suggest
that's
what
the
court
should
do
here
with
section
12(2),
is
construe
the
statute
the
way
congress
wrote
it.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
your
honor--
[laughter]
your
honor,
that's
a
good
point,
but
i
think
i
have
a
response
to
it.
it
has
been
the
law
in
the
circuits
for
50
years
that
section
12(2)
reaches
privately
negotiated
sales
of
securities.
even
today,
no
appellate
court
has
ever
reached
a
contrary
conclusion.
that
tell
us
something
about
1)
how
the
statute
should
be
read,
2)
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
set
aside
longstanding
interpretations
of
express
statutory
remedies
that
parties
have
come
to
rely
on,
but
third,
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
there
simply
hasn't
been
a
flood
of
section
12(2)
suits.
this
cause
of
action
has
been
around
for
50
years.
mr.
robert
j.
kopecky
perhaps.
i
think
the
explanation
is
that
section
12(2),
even
if
you
read
the
term
prospectus
as
we
think
it
should
be
read,
still
applies
to
a
fairly
narrow
universe
of
transactions.
you
have
to
be
able
to
prove
that
you
bought
from
the
seller.
you
have
to
prove
that
he
sold
to
you
by
means
of
some
misleading
statement.
it
really
focuses
in
on
those
transactions
that
are
a
small
subset
of
what
is
driving
the
explosion
of
securities
litigation
in
the
country
today.
i
don't
think
a
ruling
construing
the
statute
our
way
is
going
to
add
to
the
burden
of
the
federal
courts
or
cause
an
explosion
of
litigation.
it
hasn't
happened
to
date.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
