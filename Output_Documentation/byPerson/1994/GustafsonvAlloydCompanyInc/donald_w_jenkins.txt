mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
gustafson.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
as
the
briefs
indicate,
this
case
turns
in
large
part
on
whether
or
not
the
phrase,
by
means
of
a
prospectus
or
oral
communication,
as
used
in
section
12(2)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933,
is
a
phrase
of
limitation.
the
case
also
turns
on
whether,
by
section
12(2),
the
act
covers
negotiated
private
transactions
even
though
the
act
does
not
otherwise
intrude
into
such
business
arrangements.
the
house
report
answers
both
these
questions,
stating
the
bill
affects
only
new
offerings
of
securities.
it
does
not
affect
ordinary
redistribution
of
securities.
as
to
liability
provisions,
the
report
states
the
bill's
civil
liabilities
attach
only
when
there's
been
an
untrue
statement
of
material
fact
in
the
registration
statement
or
the
prospectus,
the
basic
information
on
which
the
public
is
solicited.
this
case
involves
no
new
offering
of
securities,
and
presents
the
paradigm
example
of
a
private
transaction
the
act
plainly
left
free
from
regulation
other
than
by
its
section
17.
art
gustafson,
dan
mclean,
and
francis
butler
sold
their
company
to
a
sophisticated
investor
which
conducted
its
own
due
diligence
and
negotiated
the
deal
it
wanted.
the
buyers
had
full
access
to
information
about
alloyd.
indeed,
mr.
mclean
and
mr.
butler
were
officers
and
shareholders
of
the
buyer.
the
stock
purchase
agreement
contained
numerous
riskallocating
provisions.
in
particular,
the
parties
knew
that
alloyd's
interim
earnings
were
estimated,
so,
as
is
common,
they
closed
with
an
estimated
purchase
price
subject
to
a
later
dollar
for
dollar
adjustment
after
an
audit
determined
actual
earnings.
they
plainly
could
have,
but
did
not,
agree
that
some
multiple
of
the
variance
should
apply
to
the
transaction.
after
the
audit,
the
parties
agreed
that
the
estimated
price
had
been
815,000
dollars
too
high,
and
sellers
paid
that
amount
to
buyers
as
the
agreement
required.
buyers,
who
knew
alloyd's
interim
earnings
were
estimated,
now
claim
that
sellers
warranted
a
certain
level
of
such
earnings
in
the
agreement.
they
claim
a
breach
of
that
warranty,
which
is
a
contract
law
matter,
and
also
claim
a
violation
of
section
2
of
the...
12(2)
of
the
securities
act.
they
have
made
no
claim
of
fraud.
as
to
the
section
12(2)
claim
they
assert,
it
is
that
the
purchase
agreement
itself,
the
negotiated
purchase
agreement,
was
a
prospectus,
and
they
claim
they
are
entitled
to
rely
on
oral
communications
during
due
diligence
about
alloyd's
inventory,
even
though
the
agreement
specifically
provided
such
oral
statements
were
superseded
by
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
buyers
seek
rescission
of
the
transaction
or
rescissionary
damages,
even
though
by
the
agreement
they
agreed
that
they
would
not
seek
rescission.
the
act,
and
section
12(2)
in
particular,
makes
a
seller,
we
submit,
a
fiduciary
only
when
there
is
an
initial
public
offering
of
securities.
it
does
not
do
so
in
the
context
of
ordinary
secondary
transactions
such
as
privately
negotiated
resales
of
stock
that
have
never
been
publicly
distributed.
a
stock
purchase
agreement
memorializing
the
terms
of
a
negotiated
deal
is
not
a
prospectus,
nor
are
discussions
in
the
course
of
due
diligence
regarding
the
reliability
of
inventory
estimates.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
an
offering
circular
would
certainly
be
a
circular,
i
think,
within
the
meaning
of
section
2(10).
it
specifically
uses
that
phrase.
but
the
preceding
words
in
2(10)
is,
the
very
first
definition
of
prospectus
is
prospectus
itself,
which
as
commonly
defined
then
had
a
public
solicitation
connotation.
we
believe
the
correct
interpretation,
as
demonstrated
by
numerous
portions
of
the
house
report
and
other
commentary
by
draftsman,
is,
an
offering
circular
is
a
prospectus
when
it's
used
to
solicit
the
public
to
purchase
securities.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
we
don't
believe
that
would
be
the
proper
definition
under
2(10),
or,
particularly,
under
section
2(12),
given
the
context
of
2(12)
as
a
liability
provision
in
the
act.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
the
very
first
word
that
section
2(10)
uses
is
prospectus.
in
defining
what
a
prospectus
is,
prospectus,
as
commonly
used
then,
connoted,
or
was
defined
as,
a
document
prepared
by
a
company
describing
its
stock
or
prospects
and
inviting
the
public
to
subscribe
to
an
issuer.
inviting
the
public.
that's
the
first
word
used
in
the
definition
of
prospectus.
we
believe
the
following
words
have
similar
import.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
we
don't
believe
so,
not
for
section
2(10)
purposes,
and
certainly
not
for
section
12(2)
purposes,
because
of
their
use
of
the
word
prospectus,
used
as
a
selling
document.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
public
offering,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
if
alloyd
had
issued
new
shares
to--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--the
buyers?
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
as
to
the
first
portion
of
the
transaction,
the
issuance
by
alloyd
of
new
shares
to
the
buyers,
the
exemption
of
section,
i
think
it's
4(2)
of
the
act,
would
exempt
that
transaction.
as
to
the
second
portion,
a
redemption,
then,
of
the
seller's
shares
by
the
company,
i
believe
that
would
also
be
a
4(2)-exempted
transaction,
but
i'm
not
certain.
but
in
either
event,
because
there
is
no
public
selling,
no
public
offer
involved
in
the
transaction,
no--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--there--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--there
is
some
authority,
particularly
in
the
comments
of
legislators,
and
i
think
these
are
cited
in
the
sia's
brief
in
particular,
for
the
proposition
that
the
act
just
does
not
apply
to
transactions
in
old
stock,
period.
some
of
the
commentary
in
the
house
report
is
inconsistent
with
that
sort
of
declaration,
because
the
commentary
in
the
house
report
indicates
that
if
there's
a
redistribution
of
old
stock
either
by
a
company
or
a
control
person,
that
transaction
is
subject
to
regulation
by
the
act.
to
the
extent
one
prefers
to
rely
on
the
house
report,
declared
rationale,
or
the
congressmen's
statements
of
intent
that
the
act
doesn't
apply
to
resales
of
old
stock
at
all,
i
think
either
way
you
reach
the
same
result
as
to
the
application
of
section--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--some
congressmen
so
stated
when
they
were
debating
the
act.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
that
is
part
of
our
position.
one
view
that
could
be
taken
of
the
act
based
on
those
statements
is
the
act
just
doesn't
apply
to
resales
of
old
stock,
period.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
i--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
preferred
view
is
the
view
that
is
articulated
in
our
briefs,
that
the
house
report
carefully
lays
out
how
the
bill...
the
bill...
regulates
such
transactions.
if
a
redistribution
of
old
stock
looks
like
a
public
offering,
becomes
a
public
offering,
then
the
act
applies.
i
think
that
is
the
better--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--that
is
the
primary
position
we
take.
there
is
a--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--a
different
position...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
i
would
admit
that
is...
i
personally
believe
that
is
covered
by
section
12(2).
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
i
personally
also
believe
that
that
is
a
transaction
that
the
act
requires
to
register.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
i
think
the
only
basis
is
the
statements
over
and
over
in
the
house
report
and
by
legislators--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--it
applies
to
new
stock,
and
looking
at
just
the
entire
structure
of
the
act,
it
just
does
not
appear
to
be
designed
to
apply
to
secondary
transactions,
period.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
that's
my
view
as
to
the
proper
position
to
come
down
on.
buyers
and
the
sec
argue
that
section
12(2)
extends
far
beyond
the
otherwise
limited
coverage
of
the
act,
and
applies
to
all
communications
in
all
contexts
involving
sales
of
securities.
their
argument
in
both
their
briefs
is
based
in
part
on
the
1948
decision
of
moore
v.
gorman
and
its
progeny.
they
reason,
as
that
court
did,
that
section
12(2)
covers
secondary
transactions
and
including
private
resales,
because
section
4
exempts
such
transactions
from
section
5,
but
does
not
exempt
such
transactions
from
section
12.
seller's
position,
of
course,
is
that
this
begs
the
initial
question,
what
did
section
12(2)
intend
to
regulate
in
the
first
instance?
plainly,
congress
would
not
have
seen
any
need
to
exempt
a
transaction
from
section
12(2)
if
it
didn't
perceive
the
transaction
as
covered
by
section
12(2)
in
the
first
place.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
i
respectfully
do
not
so
concede.
the
language
itself
is
limiting
language.
if
congress
had
meant
to
say
it
broadly,
it
would
have
said,
any
communication,
or
it
would
have
said
nothing,
as
it
did
in
section
17
of
the
act.
section
17
says,
you
shall
not
acquire
money
by
means
of
any
untrue
statement.
that
is
a
broad
statement.
when
they
put
the
phrase,
by
means
of
a
prospectus
or
oral
communication
in
section
12(2),
they
had
to
be
connoting
some
limitation.
we
believe
the
limitation
is
the
limitation
that
flows
from
the
natural
lay
understanding
of
the
term
prospectus,
which
is
a
document
soliciting
the
public
to
subscribe
to
an
issue
of
stock.
we
don't
think
section
2(1)
requires
that
you
go
any
differently
and,
indeed,
if
it
does,
as
the
buyers
are
attempting
to
read
section
2(10),
why
did
congress
not
simply
use
the
word,
any
written
communication
or
broadcast
in
section
2(10)?
it
used
many
more
words
than
that.
we
think
that
the
usage
of
all
of
the
words
have
to
be
read
together
in
light
of
the
initial
word,
prospectus,
as
further
communications
which
are
used
to
solicit
the
public
to
purchase
securities.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
certainly
by
guilt
by
association,
or
noscitur
a
sociis,
or
whichever
term
you
want
to
put
on
it,
and
by
the
reverse
reasoning
that
also
applies
to
section
2(10).
if
they
meant
any
communication,
why
didn't
they
just
simply
say
so?
they
knew
how
to
write
that
way.
that's
the
way
they
wrote
section
17.
when
they
used
more
words
than
just,
any
communication,
they
were
connoting
limitation.
we
have
articulated
in
our
briefs
where
we
believe
the
limitation
leads.
the
sec
and
the
buyers
are
in
the
position
of
necessarily
being
all
or
nothing.
if
it's
totally
unlimited,
their
view
is
the
phrase
does
require
application
to
every
communication
in
every
context
involving
securities.
as
just
mentioned,
the
list
of
items
that
12...
2(10)
uses
in
defining
prospectus
is
limited
to
selling
statements.
the
words
used
when
the
act
was
passed
were,
first,
any
prospectus,
notice,
circular,
advertisement,
letter...
which
could
be
broad...
or
communication,
written
or
by
radio,
which
offers
any
security
for
sale.
that
is
treating
and
describing
a
specific
type
of
communication,
not
a
negotiated
stock
purchase
agreement
and
not
comments
made
during
the
course
of
due
diligence,
which
the
parties
agreed
were
superseded
by
the
stock
purchase
agreement.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
well,
4...
the
section
of
the
uniform
securities
act
that
they're
referring
to
does
not,
specifically
does
not
include
the
phrase,
by
means
of
a
prospectus
or
oral
communication.
those
words
are
left
out
of
that
act.
certainly,
with
those
words
left
out,
i
think
they're
correct
the
uniform
securities
act
does
apply
to
such
transactions,
but
it's
an
awfully
big
distinction.
i
mean,
they're
saying
the
things
mean
the
same
even
though
the
'33
act
has
words
of
limitation
in
them
that
the
uniform
act
does
not
have.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
except
that
that
would
have
been
so
much
easier
to
do.
just
say,
any
defin...
any
written
communication
or
broadcast
except--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--are
you
referring
to
the...
i
think
it's
called
the
freewriting--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--right.
those
are
referring
to
two
categories
of
stuff--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--well,
in
some
sense
they
are
related,
that
the
(a)
part
of
that
exception
is
reference
to
socalled
freewriting,
which
is
specifically
permitted.
the
whole
intent
of
carving
that
out
is
to
specifically
permit
freewriting--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--during
the
period
after
a
statutory
prospectus--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--but
i...
unless
i'm
missing
it,
i
nonetheless
still
believe
the
same
result
would
be
reached
if
they'd
written,
any
communication,
prospectus
means,
any
communication,
they
would
have
still
needed
to
carve
out
those
two
types
of
communications
from
the
definition,
unless
i'm
missing
something.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
okay.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
i
think
the
reason--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--i
think
the
reason
that
congress
didn't
put,
public
offering
or
sale,
is
by
that
point
in
the
statute,
if
you
look
at
how
the
statute
is
drafted
it's
clear
that
the
whole
statute
only
applies
to
public
offerings
or
sale,
and
the
words
would
have
just
been
superfluous.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
17
is
a
unique
distinction.
12(2)--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--two
answers.
one,
the
language
of
17
is,
in
comparison
to
section
12,
significantly
different
and
significantly
broader,
as
this
court
observed
in
united
states
v.
naftalin.
second,
there
is
specific
commentary
in
the
senate
report
that
this
court
felt
clearly
showed
an
intent
that
section
17
extend
beyond
the
rest
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
extend
beyond
them
in
the
sense
that
it
was
applicable
to
secondary
transactions.
the
court
felt
that
both
of
those
points
warranted
a
treatment
of
section
17
as
departing
from
the
other
scope
of
the
act.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
i
believe
that's
correct
also.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
that's--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--we
believe
not.
we
know
that
section
12
applies
to
transactions
in
exempt
securities
that
do
not
have
to
be
registered.
that
is
pretty
clear
from
the
language
that
got
added
to
section
12(2).
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
that's
correct
in
terms
of
exempting
transactions,
if
you
will,
and
securities,
from
section
5
which
is
the
heart
of
the
act,
and
the
section
from
which
violation
flows.
the
fact...
excuse
me.
i
apologize.
i
think
i've
lost
the
thrust
of
the
question.
oh,
the
exemption--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--from
section
12(2)
is
just
only
necessary
if
12(2)
was
intended
to
cover.
we
believe
it
wasn't,
as
the
house
report
makes
clear
at
various
points.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
no.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
no.
prospectus
can
clearly
be
a
term
that
applies
in
the
context
of
a
public
distribution
of
an
exempt
security.
the
act,
for
whatever
reasons,
chose
to
exempt
the
security,
but
if
there's
a
public
distribution
of
that
exempt
security,
plainly
section
12(2)
intends
to
bring
the
communications,
selling
communications
oriented
toward
the
public,
within
its
definition
in
that
context.
the
act
treats
government
securities
in
a
fairly
unique
way,
which
we
believe
supports
our
interpretation
of
section
12(2).
government
securities
are
specifically
carved
out
with
section
12.
they
bring
in
resales,
they
bring
in
public
sales
of
all
other
securities
but
exclude
public
sales
of
government
securities,
obvious
reasons
of
comity
and
that
sort
of
thing,
or
perhaps
even
constitutional
considerations.
if,
as
the
buyers
claim,
section
12(2)
was
some
broad
remedy,
though,
that
applies
to
all
aftermarket
trading
and
so
on,
why
would
the
congress
have
felt
any
need
to,
in
that
aftermarket
context,
still
exempt
resellers
who
might
make
misleading
statements
about
government
securities
from
the
coverage
of
the
provision?
we
believe
that
that
special
provision
of
the
government
in
section
12(2),
or
any
governmental
entity,
further
reflects
the
fact
that
section
12(2)
was
perceived
as
applying
solely
in
a
public
offering
context.
that's
when
they
intended
to
protect
the
government
even
if
the
government
made
an
untrue
statement,
not
in
later
contexts.
i
will
reserve
the
remaining
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
i
think
there's
a
possibility
of
research
reports
being
included.
there
is
also
the
potentiality,
which
i
believe
also
applies
to
a
stock
purchase
agreement,
to
conclude
that
those
are
not
the
kind
of
selling
documents
that
even
2(10)
intended
to
include,
even
if
you
apply
it
as
including
all
written
communications.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
yes,
and
i
think
that
point
is
even
touched
upon
in
the
buyer's
briefs,
that
maybe
they're
not
a
selling
document
and
therefore
not
a
prospectus.
i
think
the
same
argument
can
be
made
as
to
a
prospectus
itself.
i
do
think
in
the
context
of
research
reports,
though,
there's
a
severe
danger
that
the
issuer
of
the
report
could
be
deemed
a
seller,
having
used
a
prospectus,
and
the
liability
imposed
by
section
12(2)
in
that
context
on
one
who
just
receives
a
commission
for
selling
stock
is
drastic.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
the
fundamental
issue
here
is
whether,
when
everybody
says
the
'33
act
was
following
the
british
act,
which
only
applied
to
public
offerings,
did
congress
somehow
in
the
process,
by
section
12(2),
totally
convert
the
'33
act
to
apply
to
all
private
communications
in
all
privately
negotiated
contexts?
the
references
by
the
draftsmen,
by
the
house
report,
and
others
that
were
involved
in
the
process,
not
later
commentary
in
magazines,
demonstrate
irrefutably
that
the
overall
scope
of
the
act,
and
its
civil
liability
provisions
in
particular,
didn't
expand
so
drastically
from
the
british
companies
act.
they
said
it
was
the
same
act.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
mr.
frankfurter
was
involved
in
the
drafting
of
the
act
but
not
as
heavily
as
mr.
landis,
i
think,
if
you
believe
what
mr.
landis
wrote,
which
may
be
a
stretch,
i
don't
know,
but
it
appears
accurate
that
mr.
frankfurter
was
overseeing
it
but
was
not
as
heavily
drafted.
in
fact,
i
think
mr.
landis
in
his
article
referred
to
mr.
frankfurter
seeing
the
draft
of
the
act
for
the
first
time
before
a
meeting,
or
something
along
those
lines.
he
was
not
as
heavily
involved
as
mr.
landis,
who
said
public
offerings
not
private
offerings
defines
the
exact
scope
of
the
act.
the
act
was
not
intended
to
regulate
sales
to
institutional--
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
--i
think
the
simple
answer
is,
they
felt
it
wasn't
necessary.
the
whole
design
of
the
first
ten
sections
of
the
act,
and
in
particular
section
5,
the
heart
of
the
act,
is
directed
solely
at
one
context,
public
offerings.
everything
else
is
exempt.
mr.
donald
w.
jenkins
that's
correct,
they
did
not
follow
the
phrase,
include
the
phrase,
to
the
public,
which
is
in
the
british
companies
act,
but
congress
repeatedly
said,
the
draftsmen
said,
this
act
is
the
british
securities
act.
how
could
those
statements
be
correctly
made
if
one
applies
only
to
public
distributions
and
the
other
is
much,
much
broader,
applying
to
every
private
transaction
that
ever
involves
the
sale
of
a
security
and
an
interstate
communication?
the
lack
of
any
explanation,
specific
discussion
or
anything,
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
house
report
of
any
notation
that
the
act
extended
so
much
more
broadly
is
to
our
mind
very,
very
strong
proof
that
congress,
none
of
the
congressmen,
none
of
the
drafters
intended
such
a
broad
departure
from
the
public
offering
context.
they
just
simply
couldn't
have
said
the
things
they
said
in
the
reports
about
the
act
or
in
mr.
landis'
article
about
the
act
if
that
were
the
case,
if
the
act
intended
to
go
into
such
a
wide
range
of
private,
negotiated
transactions.
thank
you.
