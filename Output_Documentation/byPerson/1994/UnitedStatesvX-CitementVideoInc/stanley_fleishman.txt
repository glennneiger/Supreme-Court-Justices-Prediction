mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
congress
enacted
the
child
pornography
act
of
1977,
it
deliberately
treated
the
statute
as
the
kind
of...
a
kind
of
sexual
offense
statute
where
knowledge
of
the
minority
was
not
an
element
of
the
offense,
as,
for
example,
in
the
mann
act,
and
the
mann
act
was
specifically
referred
to
by
the
department
of
justice
when
it
made
its
recommendations
with
regard
to
this
statute.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
believe
not,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--whatever
that
may
be,
your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
if
you
look
at
the
text
of
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history,
that
is
the
model,
i
believe,
that
congress
used,
and
that
therefore
congress
deliberately
and
unambiguously
omitted
knowledge
of
minority
because
that's
the
way
these
statutes
traditionally
have
been
dealt
with.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that's
an
arguable
point,
your
honor,
because
the--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--well--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--my--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--my
position,
your
honor,
is
that
the
text,
the
statute
read
literally
does
not
require
knowledge
with
regard
to
either
minority
or
the...
and
i
prefer
not
to
use
the
word
pornographic,
if
your
honors
don't
mind,
because
the
term
is
sexually
explicit
conduct,
and
the
term
sexually
explicit
conduct
is
extraordinarily
broad,
and
it
includes...
all
nudity,
frontal
nudity
has
been
interpreted
as
being
sexually
explicit
conduct,
so
we're
not
talking
about
pornographic
material
alone.
we're
talking
about
adult
material,
and
we're
talking
about
mainline
material.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
adult
material,
your
honor,
as
we
talk
about
it
in
this
context.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
your
honor,
in
many
respects.
in
any
event--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--well,
if...
to
answer
you,
justice
scalia's
question
a
little
further,
because
one
answer
that
i've
given
is
that
the
text
itself
does
not
require
knowingly
with
regard
to
either
minority
or
the
nature
and
character
of
material,
but
if
we
go
beyond
the
text
of
the
statute,
and
we
go
to
the
legislative
history,
we
have
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
correct.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
agree
with
what
has
been
said
by
justice
scalia.
it
was
a
badly
drawn
statute.
i
think
that
congress
drew
a
bad
law,
and
that's
the
simple
answer
to
the
textual
argument.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
i--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--and
that's
why
i
say,
your
honor,
if
we
go
to
the
next
step,
we
go
to
what
the
legislative
intent
is,
and
that
legislative
intent
is
clear.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
oh,
i
agree
100
percent
it's
a
poor
statute,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
an
unconstitutional
statute.
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is...
the
textual
reading
does
lead
to
that
result,
your
honor,
and
when
you
get
to
an
absurd
result,
as
that
would
do,
then
you
go
to,
as
i
understand
the
rules,
to
the
legislative
history,
and
you
go
to
the
legislative
history,
it
says
that
what
we
mean
by
the
word
knowingly
is,
the
nature
and
character
of
the
material.
that
was
explicitly
said,
stated
by
judge
wald,
then
assistant
attorney
general.
that
was
explicitly
what
the
government
believed
the
statute
read
for
15
years.
this
is
not
a
new
statute,
your
honor.
for
15--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--one
could
do
that,
your
honor.
i
prefer...
well,
one
could
do
it
in
this
way,
because
the
statute
reads,
if
you
knowingly
transport
a
visual
depiction,
so
if
you
know
that
you're
transporting
a
visual
depiction,
one
could
say
you
know
the
contents
of
that
visual
depiction.
if
you
know
the
contents,
then
you
reach
the
nature--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--i...
your
honor,
the
question
that
i'm
trying
to
answer
is--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--my
position
is
very
clear,
your
honor.
the
text
of
it
is
an
absolutely
unconstitutional
statute
without
more.
i
understand
that
when
you
have
a
statute
where
the
text
is
unconstitutional,
that
sometimes
the
court
looks
to
legislative
history.
sometimes
it
does
not.
i'm
saying,
once
you
agree
that
the
text
is
bad,
and
you
want
to
go
to
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative
history
will
permit
you
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
knowledge
with
regard
to
the
nature
and
character
of
the
material
and--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--your
honor,
i
have
no
wish
to
save
the
statute.
i'm
here
saying
it's
unconstitutional.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
you
want
to
go
to
make
the
best
case
for
the
statute...
i'm
trying
to
make
the
best
case
for
a
statute
that
is
unconstitutional,
and
i
think
the
best
case
is
not
good
enough.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
sure
you
did
it
last...
but
the
rule
that
came
out
of
the
staples
case
is
that's
only
done
when
congress
has
not
manifested
a
contrary
intent.
in
this
case,
congress
has
manifested
a
contrary
intent
both
in
the
text
of
the
statute
and
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
that
was
read
to
include
a
specific
intent
requirement,
your
honor.
of
course,
the
court
does
interpret
statutes,
but
the
one
central
rule
is
hat
the
court
will
never
interpret
a
statute
contrary
to
the
congressional
will.
once
you
have
the
congressional
will,
as
we
have
it
here,
that
congress
did
not
want
to
have
knowledge
of
minority,
then
you
cannot
do
what
you
did
in
staples,
because
in
staples
there
was
no
congressional
will
that
was
to
the
contrary.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
staples
the
court
pointed
out
that
there
was
nothing
one
way
or
the
other
to
indicate
whether
the--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--we...
with
regard
to
the
text,
your
honor,
when
the
s.
101,
the
roth
amendment
was
before
the
congress,
it
was
completely
restructured
in
terms
of
the
indentations
and
the
place
where
the
if
was
put
to
make
it
very
clear
that
they
were
accepting
the
recommendation
of
the
department
of
justice.
there
are
two
things,
your
honor.
when
this
act
was
passed
in
1978...
the
1977
act...
there
were
two
sections,
1550...
2251
and
2252,
and
with
regard
to
2251,
the
government
agrees
that
the
word
knowledge
was
taken
out,
that
it
was
taken
out
deliberately,
and
that
there
is
no
way
that
this
court
could
then
read
it
back
in
because
of
the
clarity
with
which
the
word...
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
removal
of
the
word
knowingly.
now,
in
that
same
legislative
history,
judge
wald
said,
we'll
leave
the
word
knowingly
in
section
2252,
but
only...
only
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
it
has
application
to
the
nature
and
character--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--exactly.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
it
does
not,
but
what
does
help
us
along
that
line
was
that
that...
it
was
not
just
testimony,
it
was
written
testimony
which
was
appended
to
the
senate
bill
and
the
equal
statement
made
by
attorney
keeney
was
attached
to
the
house
bill,
both
making
the
same
statement
with
regard
to
why
the
word
knowingly
remained
in
2252
but
was
not
in
2251.
and
the
reason
given,
and
the
only
reason
for
that
was,
so
that
it
would
reach
the
knowing,
the
nature
and
character
of
the
material,
but
at
the
same
time
the
statement
said,
but
it
does
not
require
the
government
to
prove
that
the
defendant
knew
that
the
material
applied
to
a
minor
engaging
in
sexually
explicit
conduct.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
because--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--well,
as
the
general
stated,
that
the
single
fact
that
transfers
constitutionally
protected
material
from
criminal
activity
is
the
age
of
the
person
depicted
and,
therefore,
what
you
would
have
is
a
very
substantial
infringement
upon
constitutionally
protected--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
of
course,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
that
does
not
involve
any
first
amendment
problems,
because
here
what
we're
talking
about
are
books,
all
forms
of
media,
and
most
of
the--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--i'm
not
sure
the
analogy
is
one
that
is
as
powerful
as
it
might
be,
your
honor--
[laughter]
--but
with
all
due
respect,
what
we
have
here
is
a
statute
that
impinges
on
all
forms
of
media.
we're
not
talking
about...
i
know
in
the
minds
of
some
people
this
is
just
sort
of
pornographic
material,
but
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about.
it
involves
movies,
it
involves
art
books,
it
involves
all
forms
of
mainline
material,
and
to
say
that
all
of
this
is
put
in
jeopardy
because
the
single
fact
that--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--your
honor,
sexually
explicit
material
involves
everything,
if
you
don't...
if
i
may
say
so
because,
first
of
all,
the
definition
of
sexually
explicit
material
includes
the
actual
or
simulated
lascivious
exhibition
of
the
genitals
or
pubic
area
of
any
person.
any
person,
your
honor,
not
any
minor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i'm
not
talking
about
that,
your
honor.
i'm
talking
about
the
person
who
publishes
books
or
makes
movies,
and
if
it
says
that
you're
a
criminal
if
it's
the
actual
or
simulated...
and
i
want
to
repeat
it,
lascivious
exhibition
of
the
genitals
or
the
public
area
of
any
person,
not
of
any
minor.
that
is
to
say,
of
a--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--of
any
person.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
and
when
we
get
to--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--oh,
well,
i'm
not
sure
of
that
at
all,
your
honor,
because
the
cases
that
i
have
read
show,
have
shown
that
virtually
any
depiction
of
a
nude...
frontal
nudity
is
considered
lascivious
by
the
juries
and
courts.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
i'm
just
saying
that
the
term
lascivious
is
so
broad
that
we
are
talking
about
everything
when
we--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--whatever
lascivious
may
be,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
the
problems
that
the
court
had
with
regard
to
obscenity
bespeaks
that
this
is
a
problem
that
is
not
easily
disposed
of,
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
your
honor--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--but
there
isn't.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
is
not.
there
is
not--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--no.
your
honor,
the
distinction
that
has
been
made,
and
i
don't
want
to
get
on
too
fine
a
point,
but
the
court
has
ruled
from
obscenity
to
lewdness,
and
then
we
are
now
over
into
lasciviousness,
which
is
something
different
than
lewdness.
your
honor
will
recall
that
when
the
statute
was
passed
originally
in
1977,
the
statute
applied
to
lewd
exhibition,
and
then
somebody
thought,
well,
that
didn't
reach
enough.
let's
just
make
it
lascivious,
because
then
we're
going
to
get
some
more
material,
too.
there
is
no
case
by
this
court
that
i
know
of
which
gives
a
meaning
to
the
word
lascivious,
and
the
court
has
worked
for
some
20
years
and
more
trying
to
give
some
meaning
to
the
word
obscenity,
so
it
is
not...
it
is
not
fair
to
suggest
that,
just
because
the
word
lascivious
is
in
there,
that
protects
the
art
books,
it
protects
the
medical
books,
it
protects
the
movies.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that's
what
the
statute
says,
yes,
your
honor,
but
if
your
honor
looks
at
section
2256(2)(e),
it
tells
you
what
sexually
explicit
conduct
is,
and
one
of
the
things
that
it
tells
you
is
that
it
is
what
i've
just
read
to
justice
scalia.
it
also
says
that
sexually
explicit
conduct
is
actual
or
simulated
masochistic
or
sadistic
abuse,
without
any
further
elaboration,
and
it
should
be
noted
that
prior--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--imagine
that,
yes.
[laughter]
i
dare
say
that
every
one
of
the
detective
books
and
magazines
that's
on
the
newsstands
would
fit
this
masochistic
or
sadistic
abuse.
it
does
not
say
abuse
for
sexual
purposes,
even,
as
the
statute
originally
did
when
it
was
enacted
in
1977,
and
that
was
specifically
taken
out
in
the
1984
amendment.
so
that
what
we
have,
then,
is
a
statute...
if
we
take
out
the
knowledge
of
minority,
is
a
statute
that
endangers
all
of
us.
i
think
what
justice
o'connor
said
is
true.
you're
all
child
pornographers.
i
mean,
i
don't
mean
to
say
it
quite
that
way,
but
you
have
received--
you
have
received
this
material,
and
if
you
didn't
know,
and
actually
if
you
do
know,
perhaps,
you're
caught
in
the
web.
this
is
a
very
broad,
a
very
dangerous
statute.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i'll
be
glad
to
defend
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
in
any
event,
to
come
back
to
the
statutory
construction,
there
is
another
line
that
i
think
the
court
should
consider
in
terms
of
why
the
appropriate
resolution
of
this
case
is
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
because
there
are
remaining
constitutional
problems
that
would
be
in
the
statute
and
i
have
already
touched
on
two
of
them.
and
that
is,
you
will
have
to
face
the
fact
that
section
2256(2)(e)
is
plainly
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
it
use...
if
for
no
other
reason,
but
for
the
reason
that
it
uses
the
word
persons
instead
of
minors,
so
you
have
it,
if
it's
the
actual
or
simulated
lascivious
exhibition
of
the
genitals
or
the
pubic
area
of
any
person.
i
assume
we
can
all
agree
that
that
statute,
as
written,
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
but
the
statute
then
should
have
said,
of
any
depiction
of
a
minor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
doesn't.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
but
if
your
honor
looks
at
2256(2)(e),
it
says--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--but
then
the
definition
is
too
broad,
i'm
suggesting.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
let's
agree
that
congress
made
a
mistake
there,
that's
all.
they
should
have
used
the
word
minors.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
may
i
just
read
the
statute?
it's
actual
or
stimulated
lascivious
exhibition
of
the
genitals
or
pubic
area
of
any
person.
now,
your
honor
is
saying
they
didn't
mean...
i
know
what's
behind
it
all,
but
the
language
used
is
bad.
let
me
put
that
aside.
there
is
another
problem
that
will
be
hanging
over
for
the
court
and
with
deep
constitutional...
a
deep
constitutional
cloud,
and
that
is
section
2251.
it,
everybody
agrees,
deliberately,
unambiguously
omitted
the
word
knowledge
so
that
it
does
not
apply
to
the
minority
of
the
person.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
right,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
but
i'm
talking
about
section
(a)
for
the
moment,
your
honor,
and
if
we
agree
for
the
moment
that
section
2252
would
be
unconstitutional
if
it
did
not
have
knowledge
of
minority
in
it,
in
section
2252,
we
agree
to
that--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--i
understand
that,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
this.
if,
hypothetically,
section
2252
is
unconstitutional
because
it
does
not
have
a
scienter
as
to
minority
requirement
in
it,
if
that's
true,
and
if
it's
true
that
2251
does
not
have
a
scienter
requirement
in
it,
then
it
would
seem
to
follow
logically
that
for
the
same
reasons
that
2252
would
be
unconstitutional,
2251
would
be
unconstitutional,
so
you
would
have--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--i'm
not...
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
your
honor,
is
not
to
say
that
it
is,
in
fact,
unconstitutional.
i'm
just
saying
that
it
would
have
a
heavy
cloud
upon
it,
and
it
would
be
helpful
for
congress
to
clean
up
the
whole--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--at
this
time,
your
honor,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
there
would
be
a
serious
constitutional
cloud
on
section
2251
without
saying
that
it
would
necessarily
be
unconstitutional,
and
that
would
be
a
prudential
reason
for
the
court
to
find
this
statute
unconstitutional,
because
it
does
have
a
lot
of
vices
in
it,
and
the
court
could
then
be
helpful
to
congress
in
terms
of
letting
congress
pass
a
law
that's--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--also
correct.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
your
honor.
no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
court
should
say
that
there
would
be
a
serious
problem
with
regard
to
the
constitutionality
of
2251,
if
it
were
necessary
to
save
2252
to
read
a
knowledge--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--well,
then
you
wouldn't
say
that.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
i
would
not--
[laughter]
i
should
hope
not,
but
i
am
suggesting
that,
to
the
extent
that
2252
is
unconstitutional
if
it
does
not
have
this
knowledge
requirement,
then
there
is
a
powerful
argument
to
be
made
that
2251
might
be
unconstitutional
for
the
same
reason,
and
it
would
be
poor
policy
to
save
2252
and
leave
2251
hanging
out
there
for
the
next,
as
the
next
target.
in
this
way
i
think
the
court
could
be
very
helpful,
not
only
to
congress,
but
more
importantly
to
the
first
amendment,
in
terms
of
to
people
who
actually
have
to
deal
with
this
type
of
materials.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
would
say
neither,
and
i
would
say
that
the
requirement
should
be
specific
intent,
specific
intent
something
like
what
you
have
in
the
cheek
case.
after
all,
if
there
are
difficulties
in
terms
of
what's
involved,
in
terms
of
what
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is,
at
the
very
least
a
person
ought
to
know
that
he's
committing
a
crime.
there's
just...
the
ambiguity
with
regard
to
the
minority
aside
for
the
moment,
there
are
a
lot
of
other
problems
in
here
where
a
person
can
be
a
perfectly
innocent,
law-abiding
citizen
and
be
trapped
into
this
broad
law,
so
if
you're
going
to
try
and
save
it
at
all,
i
would
say
that
it
has
to
have
specific
intent.
your
honors
did
that,
as
the
chief
pointed
out
earlier,
in
the
case
that
you
wrote,
justice
ginsburg,
with
regard
to
the
nevada
case
where
there
was
specific
intent
with
regard
to
the
money-laundering.
if
you
have
specific
intent
there
read
in,
it
would
seem
to
me
it's
more
appropriate
to
read
a
specific
intent
into
a
statute,
a
criminal
statute
of
this
type
of
severity
where
the
first
amendment's
interests
are
so
strongly
at
play.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
did,
your
honor,
but
there
were
a
number
of
constructions
possible,
and
the
construction
that
your
honor
gave
it
in
terms
of
the
willfulness
was
to
make
it
a--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
your
honor
did
right.
i
think
that
was
a
good
decision--
[laughter]
--and
i'm
saying
it's
a
good
model,
and
i
think
we
ought
to
use
that
model
now
in
terms
of
interpreting
this
statute
if
the
court
wants
to
interpret
it,
but
i
do
believe
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
court
should
not
interpret
it.
i
think
this
is
a
case
where
congress
has
spoken,
congress
has
spoken
clearly,
unambiguously--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
