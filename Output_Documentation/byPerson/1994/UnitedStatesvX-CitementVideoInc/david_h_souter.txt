justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
understand
it,
general
days,
when
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1978,
it
had
the
word
obscene
before
visual
depiction.
justice
david
h.
souter
at
that
point,
do
you
think
that
the
knowledge
requirement
applied
to
subsections
(a)
and
(b)?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
is
odd
that
the
deletion
of
one
word
would
imply
the
inclusion
of
two
other
unstated
words.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
would
be
knowingly
as
to
a,
and
knowingly
as
to
b.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean,
if
you
assume
that
with
obscene
you
did
not
need
knowingly
for
a
and
b--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
would
be
rather
odd
to
say
that
this
is
an
implied
extension
by
the
deletion
of
the
word
obscene.
justice
david
h.
souter
general
days,
you
haven't
made
a
kind
of
absurd
result
argument
here
this
morning.
i
want
to
know
whether
you're
waiving
it.
i
suppose
the
absurd
result
argument
would
be
that
it
would
be
ridiculous
for
congress
to
waste
it's
time
putting
or
retaining
at
the
time
of
the
amendment
the
knowingly
requirement
if
all
it
was
concerned
with
was
that
the
defendant
know
that
he
is
shipping,
or
know
that
he
is
shipping
a
visual
depiction.
that
would
be
a
waste
of
ink.
surely
congress
wouldn't
have
bothered
even
to
put
a
state
of
mind
in
there
unless
congress
must
have
had,
or
to
retain
a
state-of-mind
requirement,
unless
congress
had
in
mind
the
far
more
difficult
issues
of
the
minority
character
and
the
depiction
of
the
minority
character
in
that.
do
you
want...
do
you
shy
away
from
that
argument?
do
you
reject
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
even
without
the
ferber
consideration,
why
waste
time
putting
the
word
knowingly
in
there
if
all
you're
concerned
with
in
a
statute
of
this
scope
is
the
fact
of
shipment,
or
the
fact
of
depiction?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
presumably
congress
has
a
serious
purpose,
and
they
must
have
been
serious
about
the
subject
of
the
depiction,
and
the
knowledge
of
minority
status.
justice
david
h.
souter
--call
it
what
you--
--mr.
fleishman,
may
i
just
interrupt
you
at
this
point?
if
that's
all
congress
had
in
mind
as
an
object
of
knowingly,
what
was
the
policy
behind
it?
if,
for
example,
a
very
high
proportion
of
visual
depictions...
is
that
it?
yes...
visual
depictions
which
are
shipped
or
transported
did,
in
fact,
depict
the
kind
of
material
that
congress
wants
to
penalize
here.
i
could
understand
why
congress
would
say,
we
will
make
the
knowing
element
only
go
to
the
shipment
of
the
visual
depiction,
because
that's
going
to
pick
up
the
risky
stuff,
but
that's
not
the
case.
most
visual
depictions
shipped
in
interstate
commerce,
i
presume,
are
not
of
this
kind
of
material,
so
why
did
congress
bother
to
put
in
a
knowing
requirement,
the
object
of
which
is
basically
innocent
conduct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
without
getting
to
legislative
history,
if
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
the
statute,
properly
read,
is
read
as
having
only
shipment
of
visual
material
as
the
object
of
knowingly,
as
the
portion
of
the
sentence
modified
by
knowingly,
by
the
adverb--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
my
question
arises,
and
that
is,
what
could
the
object
of
congress
have
been
in
wanting
to
make
sure
that
the
defendant
knew
that
he
was
engaging
in
a
form
of
conduct
which
is
by
and
large
innocent?
most
shipment
of
visual
material
is
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--shipment
of
pornography.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
a
grammatical
answer,
but
it
doesn't
answer
the
problem
of
meaning.
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you've
got
to
give
some
meaning
to
this
thing,
and
wouldn't
anyone
read
that
and
say,
well,
surely
they
weren't
wasting
their
time
putting
knowingly
in
there
just
to
make
sure
that
the
shipper
knew
that
he
was
shipping
and
knew
that
he
was
shipping
visual
material?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
agree
with
me
that
if
you
don't
go
to
legislative
intent,
we
have,
on
your
reading,
what
may
be
a
grammatical
reading,
but
a
very
foolish
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
apart
from
unconstitutionality,
we
have
a
statute
in
which
we
just
couldn't
imagine
why
congress
was
even
bothering
to
put
in
the
adverb,
isn't
that
fair
to
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
does
present
you
with
another
serious
grammatical
problem,
doesn't
it,
because
grammatically,
how
do
you
separate
in
the
text
of
this
the
nature
and
the
character
of
the
material
from
the
minority
status
of
the
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
does
in
subsections
(a)
and
(b),
but
it
doesn't
omit
it
from
subsection
(c).
in
other
words,
it
omits
the
requirement
of
knowledge
for
the
offense
of
employing
the
minor,
and
it
omits
the
requirement
of
knowledge
on
the
part
of
a
parent
or
guardian
allowing
the
minor
to
be
used.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
omit
the
knowledge
requirement
in
the
advertising
section.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
ignores
the
distinction
that
justice
ginsburg
just
mentioned,
attributing
it
to
the
solicitor
general.
the
subsections
of
5-1
which
omit
the
minority
requirement
are
kind
of
action
subsections,
employing
minors,
allowing
minors
to
be
used,
as
distinct
from
knowledge
of
the
content
of
written
material.
there's
the
distinction.
so
maybe
5-1
is
unconstitutional.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
is,
but
if
it
is,
it
is
not
simply
because
it
follows
from
the
unconstitutionality
of
5-2.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
then
say
no
distinction
can
be
made
between,
can
reasonably
made
for
this
purpose
between
the
kind
of
obvious
first
amendment
subjects
of
written
material,
and
the
kind
of
ostensibly
non-first
amendment
subject
of
employing
and
allowing
them
to
be
employed.
