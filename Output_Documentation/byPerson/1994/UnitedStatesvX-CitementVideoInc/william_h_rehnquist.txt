chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
93-723,
the
united
states
v.
x-citement
video,
inc.--
general
days.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
days,
the
government
i
would
think
could
also
have
argued
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
because
no
such
scienter
requirement
was
required
by
the
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
a
majority
of
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
fairly
reading
the
statute
there
was
no
such
scienter
requirement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
we
don't
take
our
law
by
stipulation
of
the
parties.
we
would
be
perfectly
free
to
say
that
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
days.
mr.
fleishman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
we've
also
not
simply
gone
to
legislative
history,
perhaps
we've
gone
to
that
less
than
said
there's
an
implied
mens
rea
requirement,
you
know,
recklessly,
knowingly,
even
where
it's
not
written
in
the
statute.
we
did
that
last
year.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
also
did
it
in
the
nevada
cash-reporting
case.
we
read
knowingly
to
mean
something
that
certainly
wasn't
necessarily
present
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
basis
for
the
statement
that
congress
did
not
want
to
require
knowledge
of
minority?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
testimony
of
judge
wald
when
she
was
in
the
justice
department,
before
the
committee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
that
doesn't
necessarily
represent
the
final
view
of
the
committee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean--
--the
same
is
true
of
the
mann
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
say,
the
same
is
true
of
the
mann
act,
and
with
all
the
statutory
rape
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
said
the
right
to
procreate
is
covered
by
the
constitution,
haven't
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
didn't
make
a
mistake,
so...
at
least
i
think
several
of
my
colleagues
and
i
feel
that
way,
that
because
the
definition
refers...
what
you're
talking
are
the
terms
of
defined
sexually
explicit
conduct.
in
addition
to
that,
there's
a
requirement
the
person
be
a
minor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
say
that
we
should
say
that
2251
is
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we
didn't
agree
that
there
was
any
serious
constitutional
problem
with
respect
to
2251?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
i
would
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
fleishman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
days,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
united
states
versus
x-citement
video.
in
this
case
the
respondent
x-citement
video
shipped
videotapes
depicting
an
underage
pornography
star
to
an
undercover
police
officer.
they
were
convicted
for
violations
of
the
children
against
sexual
exploitation
act
of
1977
which
prohibits
persons
from
knowingly
transporting,
shipping,
receiving,
distributing
or
reproducing
any
visual
depiction.
if
that
visual
depiction
involves
the
use
of
a
minor
engaging
in
sexually
explicit
conduct.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
their
convictions
reasoning
that
the
statute
was
facially
unconstitutional
because
it
did
not
require
the
defendant
to
know
that
the
performer
was
a
minor.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reverse
the
ruling
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
hold
that
the
term
"knowingly"
in
the
statute
applies
to
the
minority
status
of
the
performers.
the
statute
as
constitute
by
the
court
of
appeals
allows
prosecution
of
persons
who
handle
a
visual
depiction.
although
they
maybe
completely
unaware
that
the
contents
depict
any
short
of
pornography
at
all,
we
are
certain
that
congress
do
not
intense
such
absurd
results.
in
reading
the
statute
to
avoid
these
results
we
recognize
that
our
past
decision
had
usually
found
a
scienter
requirements,
scienter
meaning
"knowingly
requirements"
for
all
statutory
elements
that
criminalize
otherwise
innocent
conduct.
even
though,
no
such
requirement
appears
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
the
minority
status
of
the
performers
in
this
statute
is
such
an
element.
finally,
we
note
that
the
statutes
are
to
be
read
when
fairly
possible
to
avoid
substantial
constitutional
doubts.
in
the
light
of
all
these
principles
of
fair
reading
of
the
text
and
history
of
the
statute
dictate
that
the
statute
requires
knowledge
of
the
performer's
minority
status
and
therefore
is
not
facially
unconstitutional.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
justice
thomas.
