o'connor
well,
general
days,
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
statute
may
be
that
which
the
ninth
circuit
adopted.
the
language
is
set
off
by
commas,
and
it
might
be
the
most
natural
reading,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
that's
how
it
is
set
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
do
we
normally
do
if
we
think
the
language
is
clear?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
judge
kozinski
in
the
opinion
below
thought
that
you
couldn't
read
knowingly
into
it,
but
what
the
court
should
do
is
to
import
a
recklessness
requirement
for
the
age.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
your
position
on
the
kozinski
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
wouldn't
we
import
a
recklessness
requirement
according
to
the
osborne
case,
rather
than
a
knowingly
requirement--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
the
word
weren't
in
the
statute
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
days,
this
is
a
peculiar
statute.
even
if
we
did
as
you
suggest
and
read
it
as
importing
knowingly--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--even
to
the
minority
status,
i
suppose
the
clerk
of
this
court,
in
receiving
the
video
in
question,
has
violated
the
statute.
i
suppose
we
have,
if
we've
looked
at
it
and
had
it
in
our
hands.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
certainly
the
language
of
the
statute,
even
read
as
you
would
have
us
read
it,
has
no
exceptions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
general
days,
i
thought
we
had
already
agreed
that
it
doesn't
require
obscenity
or
pornography,
but
just
a
visual
depiction
of
sexually
explicit
conduct.
