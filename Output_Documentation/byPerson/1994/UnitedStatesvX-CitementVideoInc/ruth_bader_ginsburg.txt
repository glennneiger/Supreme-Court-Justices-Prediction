justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
days,
you
said...
you
explained
that
the
statute
which
once
had
minority
as
a
penalty-enhancer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
changed
to
make
penalty
an
element
of
an
offense.
why,
then,
wasn't
this
indictment
insufficient
for
failure
to
allege
an
essential
element
of
the
offense,
because
minority
status
was
not
alleged
in
the
indictment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
first
answer
is
that
knowingly
travels
down
the
indictment
just
as
you
urge
it
travels
down
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
other
context
anything
for
the
further
proceedings?
i
wasn't
clear.
you
repeated
today
what
was
in
your
reply
brief,
we
should
reverse
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
opening
brief
seemed
to
say
that
we
should...
that
there
was
no
need
for
a
remand,
that
we
would
affirm
the
convictions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
deficiency
of
the
indictment,
because
it
didn't
allege
minority.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
word
knowingly
in
the
mann
act?
i
don't
recall.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
in
using
that
model,
they
should
have
just
said
transport
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
knowing...
you
could
have
an
illustrated
bible,
visual
depiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
you
do
that
in
a
criminal
statute?
if
it's
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
why
would
you
look
to
save
it
by
running
to
the
legislative
history
when
that
wouldn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
in
where?
this
statute
says
sexually
explicit
conduct.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
particular
statute
says
sexually
explicit
conduct,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
sure
of
the
proposition
we're
agreeing
to.
you
said
the
government
conceded
the
unconstitutionality
of
2251
without
a
knowledge
requirement,
but
general
days
just
explained
the
difference
between
the
one
who
makes
the
film
and
the
one
who
is
simply
distributing
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
case
involved
construction
of
the
words
of
a
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
willfulness,
the
word
willful
was
used
in
the
statute--
