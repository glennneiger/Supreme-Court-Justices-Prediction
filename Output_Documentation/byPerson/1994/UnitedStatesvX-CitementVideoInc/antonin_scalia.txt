when
we're
talking
about
this
earlier
version,
was
this
an
earlier
version
that
was
approved
by
the
whole
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
that
had
obscene
visual
depiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
days,
that's
a
reasonable
thing
to
do,
to
import
knowingly,
or
recklessly,
or
whatever,
where
the
legislator
has
not
explicitly
addressed
the
subject.
but
you're
dealing
here
with
a
statute
in
which
the
legislator
has
explicitly
addressed
it
and
i,
frankly,
i
don't
know
how
it
could
have
been
made
any
clearer
that
the
portion
of
the
statute
coming
after
the
word
if
is
not
subject
to
the
knowingly...
i've
asked
myself
several
times,
you
know,
how
would
i
have
put
it
if
i
had
wanted
to
make
clear
that
the
knowingly
only
goes
to
shipping
in
interstate
commerce
any
visual
depiction.
i
would
have
written
it
precisely
like
this.
it
just
couldn't
be
clearer.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we've
also
said
that
we
will
not
distort
a
statute
from
its
meaning
in
order
to
uphold
it's
constitutionality.
we're
not
in
the
business
of
writing
new
statutes.
if
a
statute
means
plainly
one
thing,
and
that
thing
is
unconstitutional,
our
job
is
to
say
so,
not
to
write
a
new
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
the
legislative
history
proves
to
me
is
that
congress
made
a
mistake.
congress
cannot
make
a
mistake?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
that's
what
they
wanted
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
is
whether
they
succeeded.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
we
have
a
statute
in
front
of
us
that
says
to
me
plainly
one
thing,
that
you
need
to
know
only
what
precedes
the
word,
if.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
going
further
than
that,
mr.
days.
as
i
read
this
statute,
all
the
person
has
to
know
is
that
he
is
shipping
a
visual
depiction.
he
does
not
even
have
to
know
that
the
visual
depiction
is
pornographic.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
way
it's
written,
however.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
it
would
be
useful
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
read
it
the
way
it's
written?
don't
you
think
it
might
be
useful
in
causing
congress
to
be
more
careful,
especially
in
criminal
statutes,
about
what
it
says
in
the
future?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
to
teach
congress
a
lesson,
but
to
read
the
law
the
way
it's
written,
and
if
they
want
us
to
apply
the
law,
to
say
we're
going
to
apply
it
the
way
you
write
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
the
second
possibility
that
justice
breyer
mentioned,
that
the
knowingly
requirement
extends
only
to
knowledge
that
the
material
is
pornographic?
why
isn't
that
a
possibility
that
you
propose
to
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
can
know
that
it's
pornography.
can't
we
assume
that
pornography
is
entitled
to
a
lesser
degree
of
first
amendment
protection,
just
as
some
other
kinds
of
speech
are,
such
as
commercial
speech,
and
say
that
congress
in
effect
adopted
an
absolute
rule.
when
you
know
you're
dealing
with
pornography,
you
take
your
chances
as
to
whether
the
actors
in
this
pornographic
material
are
minors.
isn't
that
a
reasonable
explanation
of
congress'
intent?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
see
why
that's
any
more
easy
to
reconcile
with
the
text
than
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
omit
knowledge
of
pornographic
character?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it...
i
don't
see
why
it's
any
more
arguable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--than
the
other.
you
seem
to
take
the
position
that
the
statute
does
require
knowledge
that
the
photographs
depict
sexual
conduct--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
does
not
require
knowledge
of
minority.
it
seems
to
me
if
requires
the
one,
it
requires
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
adult
material?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
is
different
from
pornographic--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fleishman,
could
you
tell
me
why,
assuming
we
accept
your
interpretation
of
it
that
it
does
require
knowledge
of
a
visual
depiction,
or
one
of
your
interpretations,
but
does
not
require
knowledge
of
minority,
why
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
why
would
it
be
unconstitutional
to
say,
look,
if
you
want
to
transmit
sexually
explicit
materials
in
the
mail,
to
send
or
receive
them,
something
short
of
obscenity
but
sexually
explicit,
or
adult,
if
you
like,
you
do
it
at
your
own
risk.
you're
welcome
to
do
it,
but
if
they're
minors,
it's
going
to
be
a
criminal
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
all
of
it.
only
sexually
explicit
material,
not
all
the
whole
world
of
literature
and
art
and
everything.
just
when
you're
dealing
with
sexually
explicit
material,
you
take
your
chances.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
and
i'm
willing
to
rely
upon
prosecutorial
discretion
not
to
go
after
the
fellow
who
publishes
a
medical
book
or
something
like
that.
don't
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--lascivious
exhibition,
right,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
wouldn't
cover
a
medical
book
at
all.
it
has
to
be
a
lascivious
exhibition.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
don't
need
the
adjective,
i
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
broad
at
all.
i
think
it
separates
that
exhibition
of
a
naked,
or
depiction
of
a
naked
person
from
a
lascivious
exhibition
of
a
naked
person.
you
think
there's
no
difference,
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--an
obscenity
law,
then,
but
that's
a
separate
problem,
but
given
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
lascivious--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
our
case
law
says
that.
we
made
a
distinction
between
pornography
and
other
first
amendment
protected
speech,
and
you're
saying
that
distinction
is
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
imagine
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
a
longstanding
exception
for
law
enforcement
officers
from
all
sorts
of
criminal
statutes,
criminal
trespass
and
so
forth.
it
doesn't
make
an
explicit
exception
for
a
law
enforcement
officer
with
a
warrant,
but
it's
understood
that
that's
an
exception.
i
don't
really
think
that
justice
o'connor
and
i
have
to
worry
a
whole
lot
about
this
statute.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
think
we
have
to
abandon
all
notion
of
pornography
in
order
to
save
ourselves.
