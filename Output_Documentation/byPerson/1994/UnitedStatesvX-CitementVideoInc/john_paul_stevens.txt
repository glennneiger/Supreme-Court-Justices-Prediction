justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
general
days,
on
the
basic
argument
that
you're
making
that
we
should
avoid
the
constitutional
issue
by
construing
the
statute
to
include
this
knowing
requirement,
would
you
not
make
precisely
the
same
argument
if
the
word
knowingly
were
not
in
the
statute,
given
our
decision
last
year
in
the
staples
case
holding
that
even
though
the
word
knowingly
wasn't
in
the
gun
statute,
the
court
thought
there
was
a
presumption
that
the
criminal
must
be
proven
to
have
known
the
facts
that
made
his
conduct
illegal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
liparota,
the
word
knowingly
was
in
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
days,
is
it
common
ground
that
this
material
would
be
constitutionally
protected
if
it
were
not,
did
not
contain
a
minority
performer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
days,
would
it
not
encounter
precisely
the
same
textural
difficulty
that
the
statute,
the
other
reading--
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
but
isn't
that
a
synonym
for
pornography
in
the
way
you've
been
arguing
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
pick
up
a
bunch
of
photographs
at
the
drug
store
in
an
envelope,
you
don't
necessarily
know
what's
on
the
photographs.
mr.
fleishman,
your
answer
to
justice
souter,
it
seems
to
me,
should
be
that
yes,
it
does
make
a
hash
of
the
text
to
import
only
one
of
the
two,
only
b
rather
than
a
as
well,
but
we've
agreed
to
make
a
hash
of
the
text
once
we
apply
the
knowingly
to
anything
that
comes
after
the
if,
so
if
we're
making
a
hash
of
the
text,
let's
make
a
reasonable
hash
of
it
and
come
up
with
a
statute
that
we
like
better.
[laughter]
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
a
reasonable
hash
is
the
one
that
mr.
fleishman
wants
to
argue
for,
because
a
reasonable
hash
surely
is
not
going
to
leave
the
statute
as
being
construed
to
mean
that
congress
was
only
concerned
with
knowing
the
fact
of
shipment
and
knowing
the
fact
of
visual
depiction.
i
mean,
i
think
you
have
agreed
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
only
goes
to
what's
sexually
explicit
conduct,
and
another
part
of
the
statute
makes
it
clear
that
sexually
explicit...
visual
depictions
of
sexual
explicit
conduct
are
not
forbidden
unless
a
minor
is
one
of
the
persons
depicted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
say
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
visual--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
yes,
i
know,
but
that's
only
a
definition
of
what
the
sexually
explicit
conduct
is.
surely
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
statute
doesn't
prohibit
all
visual
depictions
of
sexually
explicit
conduct.
and
just
before
it
defines
minor.
we
don't
erase
the
definition
of
minor
when
we
get
to
the
second
definition.
