stephen
g.
breyer
--as
i
understand
it,
i...
the
difficulty
i'm
having
is
this.
as
i
understand
it,
you
have
a
statute,
and
let's
say
it
has
three
parts.
somebody
receives
some
photos,
and
the
photos
turn
out
to
be
pornographic,
and
the
pornography
involves
a
child.
those
are
the
three
parts.
now,
one
possibility
is
that
congress
meant
all
you
need
to
know
is
that
you've
received
some
photos,
in
which
case
the
postman
is
likely
guilty
of
the
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
likely
that
that's
what
they
wanted,
but
that's
a
possibility.
the
second
thing
is,
well,
you
had
to
know
they
were
photos,
and
you
also
had
to
know
that
they're
pornographic,
and
the
third
possibility
is,
you
had
to
know
they
were
photos,
you
know
they're
pornographic,
and
you
know
they
are
children.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that
third
part
is
where
i
have
the
question.
imagine
that
the
statute
was
totally
silent.
what
is
the
normal
scienter
requirement
that
courts
import
where
the
statute
is
totally
silent?
that
is
to
say,
there's
a
whole
book
here
called
the
criminal
code
of
the
united
states,
which
has
hundreds,
800-and-something,
approximately,
different
crimes,
and
only
a
few
of
those
actually
use
words
like
knowingly,
or
say
what
the
scienter
is,
and
what's
the
normal
thing,
if
you
counted
them
up?
i
mean,
my
guess
is
it's
knowingly,
and
it's
unusual
to
import
the
word
recklessly,
but
i'm
not
certain
of
that,
and
that's
why
i'm
asking
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
you
did
think
that
the
strict
liability
as
to
the
age
of
the
person
depicted--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--raised
a
constitutional
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose,
for
example,
you
thought
a
lot
of
people
who
were
going
to
ship
material
that
they
had
a
constitutional
right
to
ship,
say
of
adults--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
works
of
art,
or
whatever,
some
not
works
of
art,
but
regardless,
they
had
a
constitutional
right,
would
have
to
err
on
the
safe
side,
and
therefore
they
would
have
to
refrain
from
shipping
material
that
they
had
a
constitutional
right
to
ship.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
believed
that,
but
you
thought
the
statute
might
be
saved
by
importing
a
scienter
either
of
recklessly
or
of
knowingly.
how
would
you
decide
which
of
those
two
would
be
the
appropriate
scienter
requirement
for
this
statute?
