mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
section
2252
of
the
child
protection
act
of
1984
as
amended.
that
section
prohibits
knowingly
transporting,
shipping,
receiving,
or
distributing
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
or
mails
any
visual
depiction
if
the
producing
of
that
depiction
involves
the
use
of
a
minor
engaging
in
sexually
explicit
conduct
and
the
visual
depiction
is
of
such
conduct.
the
text
of
section
2252
is
set
out
at
section
3a
of
the
appendix
to
our
opening
brief.
the
ninth
circuit
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face
under
the
first
amendment
because
it
held
that
the
statute
did
not
require
an
element
of
the
offense
be
that
the
defendant
knew
the
minority
status
of
at
least
one
of
the
performers
engaging
in
sexually
explicit
conduct,
but
rather,
according
to
the
court,
imposed
strict
liability.
as
a
consequence,
respondent's
convictions
under
section
2252
were
reversed.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
committed
error
in
this
respect,
because
2252
does
require
that
the
defendant
know
that
at
least
one
performer
in
the
visual
depiction
is
a
minor.
consequently,
we
urge
this
court
to
reverse
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
that
proper
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
your
honor,
we're
not
here
to
argue
whether
there
was
in
fact
an
unconstitutionality
presented
in
this
case,
but
merely
that
there
was
a
constitutional
problem.
perhaps
at
another
time
one
could
discuss
whether
the
statute
would
be
constitutional
without
a
scienter
requirement...
that
is,
as
a
strict
liability
statute...
but
that's
not
presented
by
this
case.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
because
federal
courts
are
required,
according
to
principles
of
interpretation,
to
try
to
avoid
constitutional
problems
unless
it
would
be
clearly
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
if
this
court
was
to
so
decide,
that
would
conclude
the
matter.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
what
i'm
suggesting.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
if
the
court
were
to
decide
that,
that
certainly
would
resolve
the
matter,
but
our
concern
with
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
is
that
it
made
no
effort,
according
to
the
dictates
of
this
court's
decisions,
to
try
to
avoid
the
constitutional
problem.
it's
certainly,
as
we
understand
it,
not
the
duty
of
federal
courts
to
try
to
seek
out
a
constitutional
problem
and
resolve
it
if
it's
not
presented,
and
we
think
that
particular
problem
in
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
handled
this
case
and
its
failure
to
recognize
that
normally
scienter
is
presumed
to
be
part
of
a
statute
even
when
there's
no
scienter
requirement
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
the
ninth
circuit's
failure
to
use
those
two
principles
of
construction,
namely
avoiding
constitutional
interpretation,
and
2)
reading
this
background
assumption
of
the
criminal
law,
namely,
scienter,
into
the
statute,
caused
it
to
commit
error.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
perhaps
so,
justice
o'connor.
there
are
many
readings
that
have
been
offered
in
connection
with
the
statute,
indeed,
in
this
litigation.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
knowingly
went
just
to
transporting
and
distributing
and
so
forth,
and
didn't
reach
visual
depictions.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
visual
depiction
actually
is
before
the
if
clause,
the
dependent
clause,
and
yet
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
that
wasn't
encompassed,
and
then
we
have
the
amicus,
the
linguists
who
say
that
it
goes
down
to
include
visual
depiction,
and
apparently
the
respondents
take
that
view.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
also
possible,
because
it's
not
clear
from
the
statute
how
far
knowingly
travels
down
the
paragraph,
that
it
could
include
the
entire
provision,
and
besides,
even
if
this--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
you
go
with
the
language
as
it's
set
out
in
the
statute,
but
i
think
courts
do
that
only
when
doing
so
would
not
present
constitutional
problems,
and
although
a
natural
reading
of
the
statute
is
one
way
that
the
courts
can
approach
this
issue,
i
think
this
court
has
held
that
in
some
cases,
particularly
in
criminal
cases,
the
most
plausible
reading
of
the
statute
is
not
the
one
that
the
court
should
adopt
because
of
constitutional
problems.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
he
did
say
that.
i
don't--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--our
position
is
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
do
that
for
several
reasons.
1)
knowingly
is
in
the
statute,
so
it
suggests
something
about
congress'
regard
for
that
level
of
scienter,
and
the
model
penal
code
suggests
that
where
a
level
of
scienter
is
stated
in
a
statute,
it's
appropriate
to
read
that
level
of
scienter
throughout
the
entire
statute
unless
there's
something
clearly
to
the
contrary
that
would
suggest
otherwise.
we
also
think
that
knowingly
is
consistent
with
what
congress
had
in
mind.
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
if
there's
any
lesson
that
one
can
draw
from
the
legislative
history,
it
is
that
congress
wanted
scienter
in
the
statute,
that
it
was
not
thinking
in
terms
of
strict
liability.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
that
particular
statute
is
set
out
at
3-1
of
our
brief.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
given
the
history
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history,
there
are
two
possible
readings,
at
least.
one
is
that
knowingly
continued
to
apply
to
the
minority
statutes
of
a
performer,
but
there
is
another
reading.
since
obscenity
was
added
to
the
statute,
congress
might
have
had
in
mind
that
the
scienter
attached
to
obscenity
violations
would
suffice
to
comply
with
any
constitutional
requirements.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
earlier
version?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
oh,
yes.
that
became
the
statute
in
1978.
it
was
a
statute
that
did
not
have
minority
status
as
an
element,
as
such,
of
the
offense.
what
it
had
was
minority
status
as
a
penalty-enhancing
provision,
and
it
was
not
until
1984,
after
this
court's
decision
in
ferber,
that
obscenity
was
dropped,
and
what
happened
then
was
that
minority
status
became
the
element
that
distinguished
between
legal
and
illegal
conduct.
it
became
the
boundary
between
legal
conduct,
namely
the
possession
of
nonobscene
material
on
the
one
hand,
which
is
protected
by
this
court's
decisions
and
by
the
first
amendment,
and
illegal
material
following
ferber,
which
would
be
nonobscene,
pornographic
material
involving
minors
as
performers.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
what
are
the
two
other
unstated
words?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
knowingly
was
in
the
statute
all
along.
knowingly
never
dropped
out,
and
the
question
is--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
that's
certainly
one
assumption.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
your
honor,
certainly
that
is
a
difficulty
with
that
particular
reading,
but
not
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history,
and
the
fact
that
knowingly
was
retained
throughout
this
process
i
think
is
instructive,
because
if
one
looks
at
a
companion
provision
to
2252,
namely
2251,
which
has
to
do
with
the
production
of
child
pornography,
the
history
shows
that
congress
in
1978
dropped
the
term
knowingly,
intending,
based
upon
advice
that
it
received
from
the
department
of
justice,
that
that
was
not
necessary
because
it
would
be
a
situation
where
appropriately
a
producer
should
be
given
the
burden
of
determining
whether
the
performer
was
in
fact
a
minor,
and
would
suffer
the
consequences
if
he
or
she
failed
in
that
regard.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
that's
a
very
good
question,
justice
ginsburg.
let
me
say
first
that
the
lower
courts
have...
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
issue,
but
on
that
very
point,
russell
v.
united
states
seems
to
suggest,
although
we
are
not
reading
it
in
this
way,
that
where
a
court
imposes
an
element
that
was
not
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
then
the
indictment
is
insufficient
if
it
does
not
have
that
element
set
out
in
terms.
but
one
can
read
russell
v.
united
states
and
subsequent
cases
to
hold
that
the
issue
is
where
an
element
of
fact
is
supplied,
in
fact,
by
a
decision
of
the
court,
that
the
indictment
that
lacks
that
particular
information
is
deficient.
in
russell,
it
had
to
do
with
contempt
of
congress,
and
the
question
was,
did
the
indictment
adequately
notify
the
defendant
that
pertinent
questions
had
to
be
answered,
questions
pertinent
to
the
subject
of
the
inquiry,
and
what
this
court
said
was,
it
is
not
sufficient
in
the
indictment
to
simply
follow
the
statute,
the
terms
of
the
statute,
track
the
statute,
because
the
subject
of
the
inquiry
is
not
clear,
and
therefore
the
indictment
has
to
provide
the
defendant
with
more
notice.
but
we
think
here,
we
have
the
term
knowingly,
and
if
this
court
determines
that
knowingly
in
fact
reaches
the
minority
status
of
the
performer,
i
don't
believe
that
there
would
be
a
problem
with
the
indictment,
but
as
i
said
initially,
this
is
something
that
the
court
of
appeals
perhaps
is
in
the
best
position
to
sort
out,
and
it
was
not
presented
to
this
court
for
determination.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
not
only
in
staples,
but
this
court
in
posters
'n'
things,
in
liparota,
in
bailey--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--it
was,
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
but
the
process
that
we
are
describing
that
you
identified
is
one
that
this
court
has
utilized
in
a
number
of
cases,
most
recently
in
staples,
so
that--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--certain--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
if
the
word
weren't
in
the
statute,
it
would
be
easier
to
embrace
a
recklessness
standard.
osborne
certainly
recognized--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
beg
your--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--no,
it
was
not
a
recklessness
standard.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
our
position
is
that
knowingly
is
the
appropriate
standard,
although
we
cannot
ignore
the
fact
that
this
court
in
osborne
was
confronted
with
a
case
where
there
was
no
scienter
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
and
this
court
accepted
the
ohio
supreme
court's
decision
to
invoke
a
provision,
a
statutory
provision
that
made
recklessness
the
default
standard,
so
that's
on
the
books,
and
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
that
we
think
knowingly
is
more
consistent
with
the
legislative
history,
and
i
would
assume--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
justice
scalia,
certainly
one
can
read
it
that
way,
and
perhaps
it
is
clear
to
you
that
way,
but
as
i
said
earlier,
the
clearest
reading
of
a
statute
when
constitutional
issues
are
presented
has
not
been
the
reading
that
this
court
has
embraced.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
i
would
agree
with
you
if
it
were
so
plain,
but
i
don't
agree
that
it's
so
plain,
based
upon
the
legislative
history
and
based
upon
the
various
readings
that
people
who
have
looked
at
the
statute
have
given
it.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
congress
can
make
a
mistake,
but
this
court
should
do
its
best,
unless
it's
clearly
obvious
that
congress
made
a
mistake,
to
help
congress
avoid
moving
into
an
unconstitutional
realm,
and
i
think
that
there
is
clear
on
the
face
of
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
that
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
live
within
the
constitution
as
it
understood
it,
not
to
test
the
boundaries
of
the
constitution.
senator
roth,
when
he
was
talking
about
his
earlier
proposals--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
i
think--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--it
is
the
question
that
this
court's--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that
if
one
looks
at
the
1984
legislative
history,
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
1984,
it's
clear
that
it
wanted
to
adhere
to
this
court's
decision
in
ferber.
it
removed
the
obscenity
requirement,
and
the
idea
was
to
go
as
far
as
the
constitution
would
allow.
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
conclude
that
congress,
having
converted
a
statute
from
a
penalty
enhancement
provision
to
one
where
the
minority
statutes
of
the
performer
is
the
pivotal
issue,
it
is
the
element
that
makes
the
difference,
that
we
presume
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
defendant
have
knowledge
of
that
fact.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
and
i
think
that
the--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--the
legislative
history
suggests
that
congress
did
not
want
to
impose
that
type
of
liability.
it
was
not
in
the
business
of
criminalizing
a
broad
range
of
otherwise
innocent
behavior,
so
that
this
statute
i
think
should
not
be
read,
given
that
background,
to
criminalize,
for
example,
the
innocent
handling
of
material
that
turns
out
to
be
sexually
explicit
conduct
involving
minor
performers,
and
this
court
has
stated
innumerable
times
that
it's
not
going
to
invite
that
type
of
constitutional
problem--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--where
statutes
of
this
kind
are
presented.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
scalia,
i
suppose
that
one
of
this
court's
jobs
could
be
to
teach
congress
a
lesson,
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
really--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
i
think
that
is
an
appropriate
beginning
point
in
an
analysis
of
the
statute,
but
as
i've
indicated,
the
problem
here
is
that
we
have
principles
of
interpretation
that
lead
us
in
a
different
direction,
and
unless
this
court
is
going
to
reject
principles
of
interpretation
that
it's
utilized
very
effectively,
and
i
think
very
judiciously,
if
i
may
use
that
term,
in
many
other
circumstances,
unless
it's
going
to
abandon
those
principles,
those
principles
apply
to
this
statute
pointing
in
the
direction
of
constitutionality,
not
unconstitutionality.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
you're
the
ultimate
arbiter
of
that,
justice
o'connor--
[laughter]
--but
certainly
that
suggests
it.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
beg
your
pardon?
even
when
someone
knows
that
it's
a
minor
performing
in
the
material?
yes,
i
suppose
you're
right,
and
maybe
this
court
in
another
context
should
look
at
the
question
of
what
defenses
would
be
available,
but
again,
that's
not
presented
by
this
case.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
well,
we're
standing
by
the
position
we
took
in
our
reply
brief,
because
there
are
two
issues
that
remain
for
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals.
one
is
that
the
indictment
was
fatally
defective,
and
the
other
is
that
the
tapes
did
not
constitute
child
pornography,
and
i
must
admit,
i
don't
understand
fully
the
nature
of
that
argument.
perhaps
my
learned
colleague
can
elucidate
that
for
you.
but
those
are
the
two
issues
that
are
presented
for
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand
if
this
court
determines
that
the
statute
is,
in
fact,
constitutional,
which
we
hope
it
will.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
it
is
the
issue
that
you,
justice
ginsburg,
raised
in
your
question
to
me.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
normally
scienter
is
not
required
when
one
is
dealing
with
certain
jurisdictional
requirements
of
a
criminal
statute,
and
the
fact
that
knowingly
is
sitting
there
and,
according
to
the
ninth
circuit,
just
applies
to
transporting,
receiving,
and
mailing,
is
something
of
an
odd
placement
when
there
is
this
very
significant
issue,
namely
the
knowledge
of
minority
status
of
the
performer,
in
that
new
statute.
it
becomes,
as
i
indicated,
the
pivotal
consideration,
really
at
the
heart
of
criminality
under
the
statute.
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
assumed
that
congress,
since
its
members
take
an
oath
to
uphold
the
constitution
and
swear
to
abide
by
it,
that
that's
what
congress
was
doing,
and
had
read
ferber,
understood
that
ferber
required
some
level
of
scienter,
and
was
acting
in
accordance
with
that.

i
think
that--
mr.

iii
--yes,
justice
stevens.
there
was
no
claim
throughout
this
proceeding
that
the
materials
were
obscene,
and
therefore
they
would
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment.

justice

i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
certainly
this
court
in
importing
a
scienter
requirement
in
the
cases
that
i'm
aware
of
has
looked
at
knowingly
at
the
standard,
and
not
something
less
than
that,
but
it
is
the
case
that
at
least
under
the
model
penal
code,
recklessly
is
viewed
as
the
default
standard
if
there's
not
a
mention
of
a
scienter
requirement
in
the
statute.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
why
judge
kozinski
did
what
he
did,
i
believe.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
an
approach
that
was
taken
by
the
lower
courts,
and
i
think
it
was
drawn
from
this
court's
decision
in
obscenity
cases,
where,
as
in
hamling
or
smith,
if
you
knew
the
nature
and
character
of
the
materials,
the
fact
that
you
didn't
know
that
they
were
obscene
and
you
were
told
after
you
were
indicted
that
they
were
obscene
would
not
be
a
defense.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
standard
cannot
be
appropriate
in
the
context
of
child
pornography.
one
cannot
know
the
nature
and
character
of
the
materials
unless
one
knows
that
they
contain
minor
performers.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it
is
a
way
of
reading
it,
and
we've
set
out
in
our
brief,
when
we
discuss
the
recklessness
standard--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
it
does,
justice
stevens.
i
was
just
going
to
point
out,
when
we
talk
about
recklessly,
we
included
the
fact
that
there
had
to
be
some
knowledge
of
the
nature
and
character
of
the
material,
and
then
reckless
disregard
for
that
particular
awareness,
so
it's
a
combination.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
we're
not
denying
that
that's
a
possibility,
but
continue
to
view
knowingly
as
the
appropriate
way
to
work
within
the
statute
because
of
legislative
history,
because
of
the
approach
that
this
court
has
taken
in
other
circumstances,
where
knowingly
was
not
even
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
for
rebuttal.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
waive
my
rebuttal
time.
thank
you
very
much.
