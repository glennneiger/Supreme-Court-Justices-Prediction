chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
93-1170,
united
states
v.
national
treasury
employees
union.
mr.
bender.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
might
not
the
parenthetical
material
that
we've
been
discussing,
mr.
bender,
have
been
intended
to
allow
someone
to
teach
a
course?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bender.
mr.
o'duden.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
this
report,
mr.
o'duden,
consider
simply
appearances
as
well
as
speeches
or
articles?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
solicitor
general's
answer
that,
with
a
series
of
articles
or
perhaps
with
a
book,
you
have
some
more
guarantee
of
authenticity?
it's
easier
to
trace
if
you
have
a
series
of
articles,
or
a
course.
it's
easier
to
spot
what
the
course
was
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
do
it
on
your
own
time,
why
shouldn't
you
be
allowed
to
do
that,
under
your
theory?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
was
it
determined
whether
or
not
the
invitation
was
extended
because
of
the
government
status?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
determine
the
motivation
of
the
people
that
was
involved...
were
inviting
the
employee?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
this
process
that
was
criticized
in
the
commission
reports?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
other
commission
report,
what
did
it
recommend?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
asked
what
they
recommended
with
respect
to
this
particular
thing
we're
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
o'duden.
mr.
bender,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bender.
the
case
is
submitted.
