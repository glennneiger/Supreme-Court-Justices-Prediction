justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
does
present
you
with
a
different
problem
here,
and
that
is,
part
of
your
argument
for
sustaining
the
breadth
of
the
ban
is
the
difficulty
in
line-drawing
if
you
were
to
have
a
narrower
ban,
and
yet
here
is
an
example
in
which
you've
got
to
do
some
line-drawing,
in
which
congress
in
effect
is
saying,
yes,
we
can
draw
lines
if
we
want
to,
because
there
is
a
germaneness
requirement
in
the
series.
justice
david
h.
souter
under
that
theory
a
federal
employee
shouldn't
be
able
to
publish
a
book.
the
only
people
who
can
get
the
information
from
a
book
are
those
who
can
afford--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
ask
you
the
empirical
question
on
that?
what
do
we
know,
what
is
there
for
us
to
consult
in
determining
just
how
much
of
a
burden
the
reality
is?
i
have
no
doubt
in
the
world
that
it's
going
to
be
harder
to
administer
if
we
draw
the
line
on
some
germaneness
criterion,
but
how
inefficient
is
it
going
to
be?
what
is
the
administrative
burden
going
to
be?
i
don't
quite
know
how
to
weight
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
how
is
that
consistent
with
your
concession
earlier
that
there
is
some
element
of
heightened
scrutiny
to
be
applied
here?
that
isn't
heightened
scrutiny.
i
mean,
that
is
basically
deference,
if
there
is
any
conceivable
rational
basis,
i
suppose.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
shouldn't
we
be
able
to
get
some
sense
from
prior
experience
in
the
agencies
of
the
amount
of
screening
that
would
be
necessary?
justice
david
h.
souter
--excuse
me.
the
results
may
have
been
uneven,
but
i
presume
the
number
of
occasions
on
which
they
had
to
screen
was
not
a
matter
of
judgment,
and
if
we
even
knew
the
amount
of
screening
that
had
to
be
done,
we
would
at
least
have
a
way
of
making
some
kind
of
guess
about
the
administrative
burden.
