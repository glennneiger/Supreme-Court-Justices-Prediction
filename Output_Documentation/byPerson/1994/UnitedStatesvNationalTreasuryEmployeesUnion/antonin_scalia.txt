justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
get
hung
for
a
sheep...
for
a
lamb,
but
not
for
a
sheep.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
be
a
consultant
without
doing
any
work.
[laughter]
somebody
can
pay
you
money
as
a
consultant.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
is
whether
it's
rational
if
it
just
selects
one
way
in
which
you
can
get
paid
for
doing
nothing
and
does
not
select
any
of
the
other
ways
in
which
you
can
get
paid
for
doing
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
overbreadth
doctrine
doesn't
apply
to
congress?
i
mean,
i
thought--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
first
amendment
cases,
if
you're
too
broad,
the
whole
thing's
bad.
there's
no
such
thing
as
overbreadth,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
we
should
do
in
all
cases
is
just
cut
it
back
to
what
would
be
constitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
usually
easily
separate
it.
i
don't
think
that's
usually
a
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
how
this
differs
from
any
normal
overbreadth
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
overbreadth
doctrine
is
no
good.
maybe
we
should
reconsider
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
seems
to
me
inconsistent
with
that
to
say
just,
you
know,
narrow
it
as
much
as
is
needed
to
make
it
constitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
it
is
substantially
overbroad.
that's
the
issue
we
were
directing
ourselves
to.
don't
you
think
if
this
is
overbroad,
it
is
substantially
overbroad,
if
it
covers
not
just
speeches
related
to
the
work,
but
all
speeches?
i
think
that's
substantial
overbreadth.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
o'duden,
what
troubles
me
about
your
proposal
that
it
just
be
limited
to
things
that
have
what
you
call
a
nexus
is
that
it's
a
different
problem
from
what...
i
mean,
that's
a
good
idea.
it
might
be
a
nice
statute,
but
there
are
two
really
quite
separate
problems.
one
is
the
problem
of
an
employee
trading
on
the
expertise
he's
acquired
in
the
government.
that
is
one
problem.
a
quite
separate
problem
is
the
problem
of
the
employee
getting
paid
by
someone
outside
the
government
for
talking
about,
you
know,
really
for
the
benefit
that
he
could
do
to
somebody
outside
the
government
but
disguising
it
under,
you
know,
a
speech
or
whatever.
it's
usually
disguised
under
a
speech,
is
what
the
government
says,
and
therefore
congress
chose
to
address
that.
that's
a
totally
separate
problem
from
the
problem
of
trading
on
your
government
expertness,
so
why
should
we
substitute
the
one
statute
for
the
other?
it's
a
different
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
statute
constitutional?
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
times
that
people
could
write...
you
know,
the
knowledge
that
they
bear
after
30
years
of
work
in
the
government
relates
to
one
field.
they
want
to
write
an
article
about
that
one
field.
why
shouldn't
they
be
able
to
write
that
article?
what's
the
risk?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
suppose
you
had
a
statute--
--it's
the
same
consideration--
--which
forbade
that?
--making
use
of
what
you
learned
as
an
employee,
in
either
event,
and
in
neither
case
does
it
interfere
with
your
current
employment,
as
i
understand
it,
the
hypothetical.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
appearance...
is
it
an
appearance...
i've
been
a
judge
for
something
like
12
years
now,
and
i've
learned
a
lot
of
law
there,
and
now
and
then
i
talk
about
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
some
of
the
things
i
know
about
the
law,
i've
learned
in
these
12
years--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that's
a
wicked
appearance.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
talk
about
cases
that
are
pending.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
talk
about
past
cases,
sometimes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
hope
so.
i
hope
so.
no,
but
you're
not
concerned
with
revealing
confidential
information.
we're
assuming--
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
heightened
scrutiny
test
that
you're
talking
about.
normally,
of
course,
we
just
say...
ask
whether
it
has
a
reasonable
basis,
and
we
don't
presume
to
weigh
on
our
own
whether
it's
more
than
is
reasonably
necessary,
right?
but
it
seems--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
we
review
a
normal
statute,
do
we
inquire
whether
the
statute
is
reasonably
necessary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
achieve
its
objective?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
consider
that
heightened
scrutiny,
you
know,
more
than
what
the
equal
protection
clause
would
normally
require,
which
is
just
a
rational
basis
for
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
also
talking
about
an
employment
issue,
where
the
government
is
acting
as
employer,
not
just
as
governor.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
they
cases
that
dealt
with
a
government-wide
statute,
as
opposed
to
the
government
moving
against
an
individual
on
the
basis
of
some
particular
content
to
the
speech
that
that
individual
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
there
might
be
a
difference
when
you're
moving
against
an
individual
employee,
as
opposed
to
a
general
law
like
the
hatch
act?
do
you
think
we
employed
heightened
scrutiny,
really,
to
the
hatch
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
mean,
that
you
can't
stop
public
employees
from
engaging
in
political
campaigns?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
what
does
what
you
say
mean?
it
means
nothing.
you
say,
you
can't
require
them
to
give
up
their
constitutional
rights.
that
is
a
constitutional
right,
to
engage
in
political
campaigns,
certainly,
a
very
important
one,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
require
federal
employees
to
give
it
up
as
a
condition
of
their
employment?
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
therefore,
what
you
said
is
simply
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can,
indeed,
require
people
to
give
up
constitutional
rights
as
a
condition
of
federal
employment.
is
that
true
or
false?
justice
antonin
scalia
different
point.
you
can,
but
not...
but
there
has
to
be
a
good
reason
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
congress
obviously
just
didn't
agree
with
these
reports.
i
mean,
do
they
have
to
agree
with
every
report
that
they
ask
to
be
done?
maybe
the
reports
were
wrong.
i
suppose
that
for
purely
factual
material
contained
in
the
report,
they're
worth
something,
but
as
to
their
recommendations,
they
recommended
one
thing,
congress,
our
elected
representatives,
decided
that
their
judgment
was
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
says
that.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
just
negating
their
reliance
on
the
reports.
justice
antonin
scalia
were
those
reports
addressed
just
to
executive
branch--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
aren't
there
quite
different
problems
with
respect
to
the
legislative
branch,
and
perhaps
the
judicial
branch,
than
there
is
with
respect
to
the
executive
branch--
