justice
clarence
thomas
--do
you
think
that
the
government
could,
consistent
with
the
first
amendment,
simply
ban
all
moonlighting?
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
you
mentioned
earlier
that
there
were
25,000
instances
in
which
permission
was
granted--
justice
clarence
thomas
--2,500--
justice
clarence
thomas
--well,
that
would
seem
to
be
a
larger
problem
than
the
two
in
which
honorariums
were
involved.
justice
clarence
thomas
you
mentioned
that
there
were
two,
only
two
instances
in
which
there
were
problems
with
honoraria.
justice
clarence
thomas
that's
right,
so
there
seem
to
be
more
instances,
and
i
know
from
my
own
limited
experience
in
the
executive
branch
that
there
were
more
instances
of
moonlight...
cab-driving,
outside
practice
of
law,
those
sorts
of
things...
as
opposed
to
speeches.
justice
clarence
thomas
so
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
government
would
have
a
stronger
case
for
banning
moonlighting
than
it
does
for
speeches
at
the
civil
servant
level.
justice
clarence
thomas
would
it
have
the...
would
you
have
a
first
amendment
problem
with
a
total
ban
on
moonlighting?
justice
clarence
thomas
and
you...
but
it
would
have
no
less
of
an
effect
on
speech,
on
honorariums,
than
the
current
law?
justice
clarence
thomas
but
would
there
be
a
different
effect
on
speeches
by
federal
employees
from
this
law.
this
law
simply
says--
justice
clarence
thomas
--this
law
simply
says--
justice
clarence
thomas
--you
can't
get
paid
for
speeches
and
articles,
right?
justice
clarence
thomas
a
total
ban
on
moonlighting
simply
says,
with
respect
to
this
class
of
plaintiffs,
that
you
can't
get
paid
for
speeches
and
articles.
justice
clarence
thomas
so
is
there
a
different
impact?
justice
clarence
thomas
so
the
government
can
solve
its
first
amendment
problem
simply
by
banning
all
moonlighting.
