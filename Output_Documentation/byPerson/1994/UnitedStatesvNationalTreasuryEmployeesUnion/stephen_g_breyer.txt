justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
hatch
act
i
understand
is
an
analogy.
what
about
the
son
of
sam
cases?
you're
focusing
on
speeches,
but
these
plaintiffs
are
not
talking
about
speeches,
these
plaintiffs
are
a
nuclear
regulatory
commission
attorney
who
wants
to
write
an
article
about
russian
history,
or
a
labor
attorney
who
wants
to
write
an
article
about
judaism.
so...
and
these
are
low-level
people,
often,
who
really
aren't,
i
take
it,
invited
always...
they're
not
politicians.
they're
nonpolitical
people
in
the
civil
service
who
want
to
write
articles
about
the
quaker
religion,
or
judaism,
or
the
russian
history.
if
a
triple
ax
murderer,
i
take
it,
cannot
be
constitutionally
prohibited
from
selling
his
story
for
money,
why
can
a
low-level
civil
servant
be
constitutionally
prohibited
from
giving
a
talk
about
judaism,
or
quaker
religion,
or
russian
history,
writing
an
article
about
it
which
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
their
job,
before
an
audience
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
job,
on
their
own
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
why
does
the
constitution
seem
to
apply
to
one
and
not
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
is
that
too
broad,
when
this
one,
which
says
you
can't
write
an
article
about
the
quaker
religion,
and
so
forth,
is
not
too
broad?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
is...
my
question,
basically,
is
why
is
the
public
interest
in
taking
a
gs-14
or
15
civil
servant
and
saying,
you
can't,
on
your
own
time,
write
an
article
about
russian
history,
why
is
the
public
interest
there
greater
than
the
public
interest
in
saying
to
serious
criminals
you
cannot
make
money
out
of
your
story?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
then
should
not
this
be
tailored
in
the
same
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
administrative
efficiency--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--demanded
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
way
our
opinions
have.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
still...
my
basic
question
is
what
the
standard
is.
i
mean,
i
might
say,
look,
these
are
not
political
people.
these
are
civil
servants.
they
don't
go
have
thousands
of
freebies
thrown
at
them.
they
want
to
write
articles
about
their
job
or
not
about
their
job
on
their
own
time.
all
right,
what
standard
do
we
apply?
if
i...
i
might
think,
look,
this
is
good
that
they
write
about
their
work,
not
bad,
it
educates
people,
but
congress
might
decide
differently.
i
referred
to
the
son
of
sam
statute
because
i
wonder
if
that
isn't
the
appropriate
test,
that
what
you
are
going
to
say,
congress
can
or
cannot
pay.
congress
can't...
the
state
can't
tell...
it's
overly
broad.
do
you
remember
that?
i
mean,
if
you're
not...
do
you
see
what
i'm
thinking?
is
there
an
analogy?
