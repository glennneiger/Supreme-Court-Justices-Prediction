mr.
gregory
o'duden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
its
brief,
the
government
has
offered
three
main
justifications
for
the
statute.
it
has
said
that
it
is
needed
to
guard
against
the
appearance
of
impropriety,
it
has
argued
that
this
is
a
needed
prophylactic
measure,
and
it
has
also
said
that
there
are
administrative
reasons
that
justify
the
existence
of
the
statute.
much
of
the
discussion
this
morning
has
focused
on
the
last
justification.
if
i
understand
the
government
correctly,
it
is
agreeing
that
there
is
no
appearance
of
impropriety
when
a
career
employee
writes
or
speaks
about
something
that
has
no
connection
to
his
job,
and
where
the
payor
has
no
interest
pending
before
the
government.
but
what
the
justice
department
seems
to
argue
this
morning
is
that
even
if
that's
the
case,
it's
just
too
hard
to
enforce
a
nexus
requirement,
and
with
all
respect
to
the
justice
department,
i
believe
that
that
argument
is
just
a
bit
thin.
as
we
know,
as
justice
o'connor
has
pointed
out,
the
achilles
heel
in
each
of
the...
with
respect
to
each
of
the
justifications
here
is
the
fact
that
an
employee
can
receive
compensation
if
he
or
she
writes
a
series
of
articles,
and,
of
course,
what
that
means
with
respect
to
the
statute
is,
you
can't
be
paid
if
you
write
one
or
two
articles,
but
if
you
repackage
it
as
three
or
more,
then
you
can
be
paid,
provided
there
is
no
nexus
to
employment.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fact
that
there
is
a
nexus
test
written
right
in
the
statute
is
very
good
evidence
that
a
nexus
test
is
eminently
manageable.
the
question
was
raised
earlier,
what
concrete
experience
do
we
have
as
to
how
much
of
a
burden
it
is
to
administer
a
nexus
requirement?
well,
we
would
point
the
court
to
a
report
that
the
government
believes,
at
least
in
its
brief,
supports
its
position,
and
i'm
speaking
here
about
the
gao
report,
which,
of
course,
covered
a
3-year
period
and
examined
outside
activities
that
were
engaged
in
by
federal
employees.
and
if
i
read
the
report
correctly,
and
added
up
the
numbers
correctly,
there
were
about
2,500
employees
who
had
received
approval
to
engage
in
outside
activities,
the
report
identifies
two
instances
where
there
were
arguable
improprieties
with
respect
to
the
speaking
activities.
so
in
essence,
what
the
report
has
said
is
that
out
of
2,500
occasions,
there
were
two
concrete
instances
of
an
arguable
abuse,
and
of
course--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--the
report
is
very
wide-ranging.
it
apparently
considered
all
kinds
of
outside
activities.
the
focus
was
on
consulting
and
speech
activities.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
it
would
seem,
though,
that
that
same
rationale
would
apply
to
the
situation
where
someone
gave
a
series
of
speeches,
or
a
series
of
articles.
it's
not
clear
to
me
why
that
same
notion
that
when
a
federal
employee
speaks
about
something
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
job,
would
not
also
raise
that
same
concern
in
that
situation.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
as
i
understand
the
government's
argument,
it
is
suggesting
that
the
added
volume
of
material
somehow
makes
it
easier
to
determine
a
nexus,
and
i
think
as
justice
ginsburg
noted
earlier,
that,
i
think,
lacks
a
rational
basis,
because
someone
could
easily
write
a
very
long,
very
voluminous,
single
article
with
ample
material
in
it.
someone
could
write,
on
the
other
hand,
three
very
short
articles.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
far
easier
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
nexus
in
the
former
instance
as
opposed
to
the
latter,
so
that
we
do
not
believe
that
is
a
viable
argument
for
the
government
to
make.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
no.
of
course,
when
we
first
brought
the
lawsuit,
the
series
exception
was
not
in
the
statute.
our
main
contention
has
been
that--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
gregory
o'duden
i
think
that
they
were...
they
are
equally
indefensible,
but
i
think
that
the
fact
that
there
is
this
exception
now
for
a
series,
that
that
raises
a
question
about
the
credibility
for
limiting
payment
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
we
have
never
questioned
that
if
there
was
a
nexus
requirement
in
the
statute
that
applied
across
the
board,
that
that
would
be
a
constitutional
statute.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
quite
frankly,
your
honor,
as
a
practical
matter,
no,
we
would
have
no
objection
to
that
whatsoever.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
i
think
the
way
the
nexus
test
works,
the
one
that
is
written
in
the
statute,
is
that
you
are
not
allowed
to
be
paid
if
there
is
a
direct
nexus,
so
there
may
well
be
that
there
are
circumstances
where,
if
somebody
is
writing
generally
about
something
that
he
has
worked
on,
where
it
might
be
appropriate
for
that
person
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
activity.
but
i
think
the
obvious
concern
is
that
if
you're
writing
about
something
that
you
learned
about
as
a
result
of
your
government
position,
then
that
does,
at
least
arguably,
create
the
appearance
that
you
are
trading
on
your
job,
and
therefore
we
believe
that
a
nexus
test
is
an
appropriate
test
for
congress
to
have
written
into
the
statute.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
that's
right,
using
your
public
office
for
private
gain
is
the
notion.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
for
the
very
reason
that
i
just
gave.
the
fact
that
you're
doing
it
on
your
own
time
doesn't
obviate
the
fact
that
you
are
trading
on
your
government
position,
that
you
are
using
something
that
you
learned
as
a
result
of
your
government
job
and
exploiting--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--obviously,
the
statute
only
governs
a
situation
where
you
a
current
employee.
i
think
that
once
you've
retired,
i
think
different
considerations
come
into
play.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
that's
right,
but
i
think
as
long--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--it's
an
appearance
problem.
as
long
as
you're
on
the
government
payroll,
i
think
that
it
would
be--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--that's
right.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
but
you
don't
talk--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--about
your
cases,
do
you?
you
don't
talk
about
your
cases--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--or
the
cases
that
are
pending
before
you.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
i've
seen
your
honor
speak--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--very
carefully,
though.
[laughter]
mr.
gregory
o'duden
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
that's
right,
and
i
think--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--i'm
not
saying
there's
anything
wrong
with
that.
in
fact,
we
see
from
the
current
regime,
from
the
prior
regime
of
government
regulations,
when
a
government
employee,
i
suppose
including
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court,
speaks
generally
about
the
issues
before
him,
that
has
been
deemed
properly
not
to
create
the
appearance
of
impropriety.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
tougher
case
for
us
to
challenge.
a
10-year
period
would
seem
to
be
a
long
period
of
time.
a
lot,
of
course,
would
also
depend
on
the
category
of
the
employee
that
the
law
addressed.
there
is
a
well-recognized
interest
in
avoiding
this
syndrome
of
the
revolving
door,
where
people
take
advantage
of
what
they
learned
as
a
result
of
serving
in
the
government,
particularly
at
a
high
level
of
the
government,
so
i
think
that
there's
an
arguable
interest
in
preventing
that
to
a
certain
degree.
whether
10
years
is
too
onerous
or
not,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
how
the
interest
was
actually
articulated
and
what
kind
of
problem
was
actually
demonstrated.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
there
certainly
is
an
analogy
to
the
simon
&
schuster
case,
the
son
of
sam
statute,
and
the
principal
analogy
that
it
provides
to
us
in
this
case
is
that
the
court
has
recognized
that
a
law
that
imposes
a
financial
disincentive
like
the
honoraria
statute,
like
the
son
of
sam
statute,
that
that
demonstrates
that,
contrary
to
what
the
government
has
argued,
that
the
law
is
a
direct
and
substantial
burden
on
speech.
that
is
the
main
reason
that
we
cite
to
the
simon
&
schuster
case.
if
your
honor
is
asking
me
what
is
the
standard
of
scrutiny
that
should
apply,
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
got
it
exactly
right
when
it
said
that
the
test
here
is
whether
or
not
the
law
limits
speech
in
a
way
that
goes
beyond
what
is
reasonably
necessary
to
secure
the
government's
interest
and,
of
course,
that
formulation
is
essentially
that
which
is
found
in
brown
v.
glines,
and
the
court
of
appeals...
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
the
starting
point
with
respect
to
the
proper
standard
is,
of
course,
this
court's
decision
in
pickering,
where
the
basic
general
question
is
whether
the
government's
interest
in
efficiency
outweighs
the
employee's
interest
in
speaking
freely
on
matters
of
public
concern.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
i
don't
believe
that
the
brown
v.
glines
formulation
is
a
heightened
scrutiny
test.
i
think
what
it
suggest
is--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--oh,
no.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
no.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
yes,
outside
the
public
employee
context,
yes,
it
would
be
heightened
scrutiny,
but
we're
not
arguing
for
heightened
scrutiny
here,
what
we're
seeking
here
is
for
the
court
to
examine
whether
or
not
there
is
some
sort
of
a
reasonable
fit
here
between
the
interests
that
the
government
articulates
and
the
means
that
congress
has
chosen
to
address
that
interest.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
of
course
we're
talking
here
about
a
first
amendment
issue.
it's
not
an
equal
protection
case.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
i
don't
think
that
we're
taking
issue
in
any
way
with
this
court's
notion
that
its
cases
have
traditionally
accorded
deference
to
the
government
employer,
but
when
you
read
cases
like
pickering
and
connick
and
rankin,
they
all
make
very
clear
that
where
the--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--i
believe
those
cases
purport
to
establish
a
general
standard
that
applies
to
assessing
when
a
limitation
on
public
employee
speech
is
justified,
and
what
they
say
is
that
where
the
speech
activity
in
question
substantially
involves
a
matter
of
public
concern,
then
the
government
has
to
make
some
sort
of
meaningful
showing
that
its
interest
is
threatened
in
the
absence
of
that
limitation.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
no,
and
i
emphasize
again
that
we
are
not
arguing
in
favor
of
what
we
would
term
to
be
a
heightened
standard
of
scrutiny.
i'm
glad
you
brought
the
hatch--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--i
believe
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
approach
the
court
used
in
mitchell,
which
is
similar
to
a
rational
basis
test,
and
what
it
has
come
to
apply.
i
think
that
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
connick,
the
mitchell
case,
the
rationale
was
grounded
on
the
notion
that
public
employees
could
be
required
to
surrender
their
constitutional
rights
when
they
came
to
work
for
the
government.
this
court
has
long
rejected
that
notion.
it
made
that
clear,
for
example,
in
shelton
v.
tucker,
where
the
court
looked
at
a
statute
that
limited
the
first
amendment
rights
of
public
employees.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
no,
your
honor.
what
we're
saying--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--it
is.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
okay.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
no--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--only
where
there
has
been
a
showing
that
there
are
government
interests
that
are
actually
at
stake.
let's
take
a
look
at
the
hatch
act.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
we're
happy
to
live
with
that
formulation,
your
honor,
that
there
has
to
be
a
good
reason
for
it,
and
we
think
that
the
hatch
act
cases
illustrate
a
circumstance
where
there
was
a
good
reason
for
a
prophylactic
measure
in
that
case,
because
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
letter
carriers,
there
was
a
well-documented
history
going
all
the
way
back
to
the
days
of
thomas
jefferson
that
when
government
employees
engaged
in
political
activities,
that
problems
ensued,
and
it
goes
on--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--exactly.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
when
i--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
we
would
welcome
the
court
to
apply
a
higher
standard
of
scrutiny
than
it
has
applied
in
cases
like
connick.
we're
not
suggesting
that.
the
only
thing
that
i'm
trying
to
accomplish
here
is
to
assure
the
court
that
we're
not
asking
for
the
court
to
apply
a
strict
scrutiny
test
in
every
government
employee
case.
but
this
court
has
indicated,
and
i
think
maybe
this
is
the
point
of
your
honor's
question,
where
the
government
employee
is
speaking
on
something
where
there's
essentially
really
no
connection
to
his
job,
where
he's
writing
an
article
about
dance,
or
about
music,
then,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
pickering,
he
is
to
be
treated
as
a
member
of
the
general
public,
and
in
that
situation,
obviously
the
court
is
required
to
take
a
very
close
look
at
the
justifications
that
the
government
has
offered
in
support
of
the
statute.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
yes,
it
is,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
the
class
does
include
everybody,
but
the
way
the
class
was
defined,
it
was
defined
in
a
way
to
make
clear
that
what
people
want
to
be
able
to
do
is
to
engage
in
speech
activities
in
the
same
way
that
they
did
before
the
honoraria
statute
was
imposed.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
yes,
we
do,
your
honor,
and
by
reference
it
refers
to
laws
that
were
in
place
before
the
honoraria
statute
was
passed
and,
of
course,
as
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
points
out,
before
the
statute
was
in
place,
there
was
a
nexus...
there
was
a
nexus
test
pursuant
to
government-wide
regulation
that
could
not
be
violated
if
an
employee
wanted
to
write
or
to
speak
for
pay.
and
that
is
to
say,
an
employee
couldn't
receive
payment
if
the
invitation
were
extended
because
of
his
government
status,
or
if
the
payor
had
an
interest
that
might
be
affected
by
the
employee's
performance
of
his
job.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
that
was
done
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
in
many
situations,
and
this
is
typical,
we
think,
of
everybody
at
the
irs,
for
example,
and
this
point
is
made
in
our
brief
and
it's
also
illustrated
in
the
joint
appendix,
people
who
work
at
many
federal
agencies,
before
they
can
engage
in
any
outside
activity,
they
have
to
get
approval,
prior
approval
from
their
agency,
so
what
someone
would
do
is
to
say,
i'm
intending
to
write
an
article
about
music
or
dance,
and
the
ethics
agency,
the
officer
would
review
that
and
make
sure
that
there
was
no
ethics
problem,
and
then
that
activity
would
be
approved.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
i
don't
know
if
the
analysis
went
that
deep,
but
what
he
would
do
is
to
look
at
whether
the
entity
who
proposed
to
make
the
payment
had
any
matters
that
were
then
pending
before
the
agency
that
could
be
directly
affected
by
that
employee's
performance--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--it
was
this
process
that
was
criticized
to
some
degree
in
the
gao
report
that
i
mentioned
earlier,
and
that
is
the
report
that,
as
i
mentioned,
found
two
instances
of
impropriety
out
of
2,500
employees
who
had
been
approved
to
engage
in
outside
activities.
i
think
it's
also
important
to
point
out
that
the
gao
report,
after
it
made
its
study,
its
conclusion
was
not
that
there
be
a
broad
ban
with
respect
to
all
outside
activities.
the
recommendation
that
it
made
was
that
enforcement
be
tightened
up.
it
made
certain
recommendations
to
the
office
of
government
ethics,
and
as
the
gao
report
makes
clear,
the
office
of
government
ethics
adopted
all
of
those
recommendations.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
the
other
commission
report,
i
think
you're
referring
here
to
the
wilkey
commission
report
and
to
the
quadrennial
commission
report.
of
course,
the
overriding
focus
there
was
on--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--the
wilkey
commission
report
recommended
a
ban
on
honoraria
with
respect
to
all
three
branches
of
government,
but
i
think
that
any
analysis
of
the
wilkey
commission
report
has
to
begin
with
the
definition
that
it
had
of
honoraria.
if
you
look
at
that
report,
you'll
see
that
honoraria
was
defined
to
refer
to
compensation
that
was
received
for
the
giving
of
speeches
and,
of
course,
the
wilkey
commission
report
drew
on
the
quadrennial
commission
report
which
emphasized
that
the
focus
was
on
situations
where
people
were
giving
talks
for
money
before
special
interest
groups.
the
wilkey
commission
report
actually
points
out
that
it
did
not
intend,
by
the
way,
to
bar
compensation
where
people
were
engaged
in
the
writing
of
scholarly
articles,
and
so
our
point
is
that
when
you
look
at
the
definition
of
the
wilkey
commission
report
of
honoraria,
when
you
look
at
what
it
said
about
the
writing
of
articles,
there's
simply
no
foundation
there
on
which
the
government
can
build
a
reasonable
case
that
this
law
does
not
go
farther
than
reasonably
necessary.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
i
believe
that
the
wilkey
commission
report
did
recommend
an
exclusion
for
travel
expenses,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
did.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
the--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--well,
the
legislation
says
that
you
can
be
reimbursed
for
travel
expenses
for
yourself
and
for
one
relative
and,
of
course,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
that
that
underscores
once
again
that
this
is
a
very
odd
law,
at
least
with
respect
to
career
employees,
because
i
think
in
the
real
world,
career
employees
are
not
the
beneficiaries
of
that
kind
of
exclusion.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
of
course,
there's
no
indication
at
all
in
the
history
or
the
legislative
record
that
congress
made
any
such
considered
judgment,
and
the
main
import
of
our--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--of
course
it
does,
but
i...
we
believe
that
it
is
very
odd
for
the
government
to
be
relying
on
the
wilkey
commission
report
and
the
quadrennial
commission
report
where
in
fact
those
reports
do
not
provide
a
foundation
on
which
the
government
may
rely.
it
doesn't
provide
a
rationale
here
for
what
the
government
says
or
for
what
congress
did,
for
that
matter.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
yes--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--i
think
that
that
would
present
a
different
question.
i
think
it
would
be
a
much
harder
case
for
us
to
bring.
it's
arguable
that
there
may
be
a
due
process
argument
there
to
be
made,
depending
on
what
the
reasons
were
for
the
moonlighting
ban,
but
of
course--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--2,500--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--in
the
gao
report,
sir.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
there
were
problems
with
respect
to
speeches,
your
honor,
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
arguably.
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
the
gao
report
concluded
that
there
was
a
moonlighting
problem
in
the
federal
work
force,
but
of
course,
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
statute
that
is
a
ban
on
moonlighting,
it
is
a
law
that
singles
out
only
speech
activities
and
i
think,
as
this
court's
precedent
makes
quite
clear,
when
a
law
singles
out
speech
activities,
that,
by
definition,
makes
it
suspect.
unless
there
are
further
questions--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--i
think
that
would
be
a
difficult
argument
to
make,
because
the
court's
decisions
indicate
that
laws
of
general
applicability
do
not
lend
themselves,
at
least
not
very
readily,
to
a
first
amendment
challenge.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
the
problem,
again,
is
that
a
law
like
that
would
not
be
singling
out
speech.
i
think
that
the
court
has--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--if
there
were
a
flat-out
moonlighting
ban?
mr.
gregory
o'duden
no.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
or
anything
else.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
no,
there
is
no
different
impact.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
perhaps.
i
think
that
there
is
some
suggestion,
maybe,
from
this
court's
earlier
precedent,
the
murdock
case,
that
you
might
be
able
to
make
a
first
amendment
challenge,
but
again,
this
court
has
treated
in
a
special
way
statutes
that
single
out
speech
activities.
we've
seen
it
do
so
in
cases
like
minneapolis
star
and,
of
course,
the
arkansas
writers
project,
so
it
is
no
defense
for
the
government
to
say
that
it
could
pass
a
moonlighting
statute,
because
that
is
not
what
it
has
done
here.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
time.
