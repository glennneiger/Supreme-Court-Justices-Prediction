mr.
bender,
on
the
subject
of
doing
something,
i
know
there
was
a
time
when
lawyers
were
paid
by
the
word,
but
a
great
man
said,
"it
takes
time
to
write
it
short.
"
and
this
notion
that
many
words,
spreading
it
out
into
a
series,
is
somehow
a
guarantee
that
there
is
more
work
that
will
be
done,
is
problematic.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
can--
--mr.
bender,
can
you
explain
on
the
question
of
exceptions
why
one
appearance
or
one
writing
is
okay
if
you
are
faculty
or
a
student
of
a
military
school?
what
was
the
basis
for
allowing
that
exception?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
students?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
bender,
in
the
event
that
your
main
argument
doesn't
prevail,
may
i
ask
what
you
think
of
the
silberman
solution
by
way
of
a
remedy,
which
would
in
effect
be
changing
the
place
of
the
open
paren?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
mechanism
for
the
series?
is
there
some
screening?
do
you
have
to
check
that
in
advance,
and
how
much
more
of
a
burden
would
it
be
if
that,
whatever
that
mechanism
was,
was
simply
extended?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
i
understand
you
to
say,
though,
is
if
you're
wrong
about
the
constitutionality
of
this,
you
would
prefer
extension
of
this...
it's
got
to
be
a
screening
device
extension
of
what's
done
for
the
series
to
all
of
the
speeches
to
total
destruction
of
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
say
a
statute
with
that
qualification,
the
series
nexus
test
just
extended
across
the
board,
that
such
a
statute
would
be
constitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
you
would
have
no
objection
to
the
solution
that
judge
silberman
proposed
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
see
no
difference
between
the
approach
the
court
took
in
mitchell
the
first
time
it
examined
the
hatch
act
and
letter
carriers
the
second
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
a
certification
that
describes
the
class?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
any
of
these
reports
deal
with
the
travel
expense
side
of
it
at
all?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
legislation
doesn't
have
any--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ceiling,
or
exclusion.
