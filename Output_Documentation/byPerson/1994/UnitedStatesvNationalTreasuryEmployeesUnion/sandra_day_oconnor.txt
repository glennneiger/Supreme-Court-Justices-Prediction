mr.
bender,
in
the
definitions
section,
505(3),
which
defines
the
term,
honorarium,
apparently
it
was
amended
to
add
some
parenthetical
material
so
that
it
now
provides...
"the
term,
honorarium,
means
a
payment
of
money
or
anything
of
value
for
an
appearance,
speech,
or
article,
including
a
series
of
appearances,
speeches,
or
articles,
if
the
subject
matter
is
directly
related
to
the
individual's
official
duties,
et
cetera.
"
justice

i
am
unclear
what
the
purpose
of
that
amendment
was.
it
seems
to
provide,
as
it's
written,
that
a
person
can't
get
an
honorarium
for
a
single
speech
or
article,
but
can
if
the
person
gets
several,
and
i
just
don't
understand
what
we
do
with
a
provision
like
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean,
you
think
that
it
was
intended
to,
as
structured
with
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute,
to
prohibit
an
honorarium
if
it's
a
single
speech
or
article,
but
to
allow
it
if
there
are
several?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
think
that
makes
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
absurd?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
bender,
this...
it
would
make
a
lot
more
sense
if
the
opening
of
the
parenthesis
were
inserted
just
before
"if",
and
after
"series
of
appearances,
speeches,
or
articles.
"
then
it
would
be
clear
that
honorarium
means
payment
of
money
or
anything
of
value
for
an
appearance,
speech,
or
article,
or
a
series
of
appearances,
speeches,
and
articles,
if
the
subject
matter
is
directly
related.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
it
was
just
a
drafting
error.
they
just
put
the
parenthesis
in
the
wrong
place.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
if
it's
a
series,
the
statute
requires
that
evaluation--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so
it
just
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
isn't
limited
to
teaching.
it
doesn't
even
say
teaching.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
a
class
action,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
class
includes
people
in
various
categories,
including
those
who
are
trying
to
trade
on
their
job
and
who
want
to
talk
about
something
that
directly
relates
to
their
job
and
so
forth.
i
mean,
the
class
includes
everybody,
as
i
understand
it.
