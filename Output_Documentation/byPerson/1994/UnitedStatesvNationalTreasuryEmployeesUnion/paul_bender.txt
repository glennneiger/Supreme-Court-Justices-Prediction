mr.
paul
bender
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
the
honorarium
provision
contained
in
the
federal
ethics
reform
act
of
1989,
a
provision
that
prohibits
federal
employees
in
all
three
branches
of
government
from
accepting
compensation
beyond
ordinary
and
necessary
travel
expenses
for
making
appearances,
giving
speeches,
or
writing
articles.
regulations
of
honoraria
of
this
kind
for
these
same
activities
have
been
part
of
federal
statutory
law
since
the
mid-1970's.
in
1974,
congress
imposed
a...
not
a
total
ban,
but
a
monetary
limit
on
the
amount
that
federal
employees
could
be
paid
in
honoraria.
it
was
$1,000
per
appearance
and
a
$15,000
annual
limit
that
was
later
raised
to
$2,000
per
appearance
and
a
$25,000
annual
limit.
in
1981,
the
annual
limit
was
removed,
but
the
$2,000
limit
remained.
in
the
ethics
reform
act
of
1989,
congress
decided
to,
instead
of
dealing
with
this
by
putting
a
monetary
limit
on
the
amount
that
a
federal
employee
could
obtain
through
honoraria
for
these
activities,
to
eliminate
them
altogether.
it
did
this
on
the
advice
of
two
federal
commissions,
one
the
quadrennial
commission,
which
makes
periodic
reports
and
gives
advice
on
federal
salaries,
and
the
other
an
ethics
commission,
ethics
in
federal
government
commission,
appointed
by
president
bush
in
the
last
1980's.
both
of
those
commissions
recommended
that
the
policy
be
changed
from
a
limit
on
the
amount
of
honoraria
to
total
prohibition
of
federal
employees
in
all
three
branches
obtaining
honoraria.
congress
did
this,
as
well,
in
light
of
very
strong
public
concern
about
the
use
of
honoraria
for
those
activities
as
a
way
of
steering
compensation
to
federal
employees
who
might
have,
when
the
person
steering
the
compensation
might
have
some
reason
to
want
some
favors
or
special
treatment
from
the
federal
employees.
that
had
been
most
prominent
with
regard
to
members
of
congress
and
congressional
staffs,
but
the
commissions
recommended,
and
congress
followed
their
advice,
that
it
made
sense
to
apply
the
ban
across
the
board
and
not
just
to
limit
it
to
the
legislative
branch.
initially,
it
did
not
apply
to
the
senate,
or
senate
staff
members,
and
in
response
to
that,
the
senate
decided
not
to
take
a
pay
raise
that
went
to
the
house
at
that
time,
but
a
couple
of
years
later,
the
senate
voted
itself
into
the
ban,
it
and
its
staff,
so
that
the
ban
now
applies
to
all
federal
employees
in
all
three
branches
of
government.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
when
i
first
saw
that,
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
person
had
made
a
typographical
error,
and
that
the
parenthesis
should
have
been
moved
up
several
words,
but
the
history
of
the
statute
shows
that
it
was,
in
fact,
intended
to
be
exactly
as
it
was
written.
as
originally
written,
that
whole
parenthesis
was--
mr.
paul
bender
--yes,
i
think
that's
the
clear
intention,
because
at
the
time
in
congress
there
was
a
proposal
to
apply
the
nexus
requirement.
that
is,
which
says
that
the
honorarium
is
prohibited
only
if
it's
directly
related
to
the
official's...
to
the
individual's
official
duties,
or
payment
is
made
because
of
the
individual's
status
with
the
government.
there
was
a
proposal
in
the
senate
to
apply
that
to
the
whole
definition,
and
that
failed,
and
instead
this
was
put
in.
mr.
paul
bender
it
seems
counterintuitive.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
it's
absurd,
although
i
admit
that
it
is
counterintuitive.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
think
the
difference
is
that
first
of
all
the
reason
they
did
that
was
that
the
statute,
as
originally
written...
if
you
just
leave
out
the
parenthesis,
you
will
see
how
it
was
originally
written.
it
says,
for
an
appearance,
speech,
or
article,
and
there
was
confusion
about
whether
the
statute
would
apply
to
a
series,
because
it
was
stated
in
the
singular,
and
this
was
put
in
to
make
it
clear
that
it
did
apply
to
a
series,
because
that
wasn't
clear
before.
the
difference,
i
think,
between
a
series
and
an
individual
speech
can
be
seen
if
you
think
about
the
reason
for
the
prohibition
in
the
first
place.
the
problem
with
honoraria...
honoraria,
not
any
payment
for
anything
you
do.
moonlighting
is
not
generally
prohibited
in
the
federal
government.
the
problem
with
honoraria
is
that
they
can
be
paid
for
relatively
little
or
no
work.
you
can
make
an
appearance
without
doing
any
work.
you
can
just
go
there.
you
can
make
a
speech
without
doing
very
much
work.
you
can
write
an
article
and
have
somebody
else
write
it
for
you
and
put
your
name
on
it,
or
circulate
the
same
article
again.
those
are
the
things
that
the
statute
meant
to
stop,
payment
for
things
that
could
be
used
to
transfer
payment
to
government
officials
who
really
didn't
earn
the
money.
they
were
favors.
mr.
paul
bender
there's
no
question
of
that,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
it
would
be
possible
for
congress
to
have
broadened
this
and
made
it
a
much
broader
ban
on
lots
of
other
outside
compensation.
i
think
congress--
mr.
paul
bender
--ordinarily,
congress
does
not
have
to
deal
with
all
problems.
it
can
limit
its
prohibitions
to
the
things
that
have
proved
to
be
the
biggest
problem.
i
think--
mr.
paul
bender
--it's
obviously
not
an
absolute
guarantee.
this
is
a
broad,
prophylactic
statute.
the
lines
are
not
absolutely
precise.
if
this
were
a
statute
dealing
with
a
prohibition
on
speech,
rather
than
merely
a
prohibition
on
payment
for
speech,
if
this
were
a
statute
dealing
with
people
who
were
not
federal
employees,
that
kind
of
grossness
of
the
statute
i
think
would
pretty
clearly
make
it
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
one
of
the
functions
that...
that's
one
of
the
functions
that
it
serves,
and
i
think
that's
a
good
example
of
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
not
likely
to
produce
a
payment
made
to
curry
favor
with
a
federal
employee
and
is
much
more
likely
to
be
made
because
of
some
real
value
that
the
person
has
given.
it's
hard
to
teach
a
whole
course
and
not
do
any
work.
it's
a
lot
easier
to
give
a
single
speech.
these
are
not
perfect
lines.
it
is
obvious
that
a
speech
can
reflect
a
lot
of
work,
and
a
series
of
speeches,
the
office
of
government
ethics
has
interpreted
series
to
mean
three...
certainly
you
could
do
three
speeches
without
doing
a
tremendous
amount
of
work,
but
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
here,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
that
in
mind,
is
not
to
be
overbroad.
it
wanted
to
preserve
as
much
as
possible
without...
without
casting
doubt
on
the
integrity
of
the
federal
service,
it
wanted
to
preserve
as
much
as
possible
the
opportunity
to
earn
some
money
on
the
side.
mr.
paul
bender
i
agree
with
you,
justice
o'connor.
if
i
were
doing
it,
that's
what
i
would
have
done,
and
many
people
in
congress
wanted
to
do
that,
but
the
question--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
legislative
history
i
think
makes
it
clear
that
it
wasn't
just
a
drafting
error
because,
as
i
say,
there
was
a
proposal
to
add
that
nexus
limitation
to
the
whole
thing,
and
that
proposal
failed,
and
this
proposal
passed.
the
issue
is
not
what
you
or
i
think
would
make
more
sense.
the
issue
is
whether
what
congress
has
done
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
bender
in
the
series,
yes,
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that,
or
the
explanation
for
that,
might
well
be
that
there
are
many
less
cases
where
people
do
a
series.
for
example,
some
people
teach
courses,
but
there
aren't
very
many
of
those,
and
therefore
it's
possible
for
the
ethics
officials
who
have
to
administer
this
to
have
to
deal
with
that
small
number
of
cases.
mr.
paul
bender
i
believe
it
was,
congress
wanted
to
make
the
exception
for
the
military,
and
i
think
it
had
to
do
with...
i
can
explain
this
much
more
easily
for
the
faculty
than
the
students.
the
faculty
of
military
academies
wanted
to
be
considered
on
the
same
plane,
and
i
think
they
should
be
considered
of
the
same
plane,
as
faculty
of
other
institutions,
and
to
say
that
they
could
not
make
speeches
for
compensation
the
way
other
faculty
members
do
treats
them
as
not
really
like
regular
faculty
members.
i
think
that
was
the
reason
for
doing
it.
mr.
paul
bender
i
have
no
explanation
for
the
students.
congress
decided
to
make
the
exception.
but
i
think
here
there
are
things
that
will
occur
to
all
of
us,
and
when
you
read
the
regulations,
you
can
see
other
things
that
occur
to
you.
fiction,
for
example,
is...
the
regulations
say
is
not
covered
by
this.
poems
are
not
covered
by
this.
there
are
things
that
seem
to
be
irrational,
but
if
you
think
of
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
administrability,
i
think
the
rationale
becomes
a
little
clearer.
the
problem
with
a
single
speech
and
applying
a
nexus
requirement
is,
you
have
to
know
what's
in
the
speech.
the
ethics
official...
for
example,
everyone
would
agree
that
if
the
speech
is
directly
connected
to
the
work
of
the
person,
then
congress
may
ban
it.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
but
with
a
series
it's--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
with
a
series
it's
easier
to
know
what
the
subject
matter
is.
for
example,
in
chief
justice
rehnquist's
example
of
someone
teaching
a
course,
a
course
will
have
a
name,
the
course
will
have
a
description,
the
university
will
require
the
course
to
be
tailored
to
the
name
and
the
description,
so
you
can
tell...
i
think
more
easily
with
a
series
you
can
tell
whether
or
not
the
subject
matter
is
a
problem.
and
also
i
think
the
intention
was
to
permit
teaching,
because
congress
probably
thought
that
teaching
by
some
federal
officials
was
something
that
was
very
strongly
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
and
again,
it's
blunter
than
it
might
be.
the
question
for
the
court
is
whether
that
bluntness...
there's
no
question
that,
i
think...
i
think
it's
common
ground
both
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
with
respondents
that
there
is
a
core
of
activity
to
which
this
statute
plainly
constitutionally
applies.
mr.
paul
bender
if
a
member
of
the
solicitor
general's
office
were
to--
mr.
paul
bender
--currying
favor
is
one
of
the
problems,
but
there
are
others.
for
example,
suppose
a
member
of
the
solicitor
general's
office
was
asked
to
go
to
a
law
firm
and
give
a
talk
about
tips
on
arguing
before
the
supreme
court,
sharing
your
experience.
the
problem
with
that
kind
of
thing
is,
the
people
who
can
pay
for
that
information,
gleaned
or
amassed
as
part
of
one's
federal
employment,
can
get
information
from
a
federal
officer
that
people
who
can't
pay
for
it
can't
get.
you
could
have
a
doctor
who
works
at
nih
giving
lectures
about
the
work
he
does
to
drug
companies
or
insurance
companies
about
the
work
he
does,
and
that
information
just
goes
to
those
people.
so
i
think
to
have
a
federal
employee
be
paid
for
talking
about
the
work
the
federal
employee
does
raises
a
different
concern,
which
is
that
people
who
are
able
to
pay
for
it
shouldn't
be
able
to
get
information
from
federal
employees
that
people
who
can't
pay
for
it
can't
get.
mr.
paul
bender
i
agree
with
that,
right.
mr.
paul
bender
there's
a
balance
i
think
that
congress
is
drawing
in
saying
that
a
book
is
likely
to
be
so
valuable
that
we
want
to
permit
people
to
do
it,
and
a
book
is
easier
to
police,
because
it's
a
public
thing
that
is
published
and
can
be
seen
and
can
be
looked
at
by
an
ethics
official
to
see
whether
there's
anything
in
the
book
that
compromises
the
federal
official,
whereas
speeches
are
evanescent,
they're
gone.
does
a
federal
ethics
official
have
to
go
to
the
speech?
an
appearance
is
even
harder
to
judge,
and
even
with
regard...
for
example,
if
somebody
makes
a
speech
at
a
garden
club
to
talk
about
how
to
grow
roses,
and
the
person
who
does
that
is
a
lawyer
in
the
department
of
justice,
that
seems
perfectly
innocent,
but
maybe
the
head
of
the
speaker's
bureau
of
the
garden
club
has
a
case
before
that
lawyer.
how
in
the
world
would
the
federal
ethics
official
ever
know
that?
i
think
it's--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
that,
or
something
very
similar
to
it,
is
the
correct
solution.
if
the
court
feels
that
congress
did
not
have
the
right
to
write
a
broad,
prophylactic
statute
here
and
that
the
extension
to
honoraria
that
have
no
nexus
is
unconstitutional,
then
the
right
remedy
is
to
say
that
the
statute
cannot
be
applied
to
those
honoraria
rather
than--
mr.
paul
bender
--to
some
extent,
i
think
it
does.
if--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
congress
has
no
formal
empirical
data
but
its
understanding
of
the
way
federal
government
works
and
what
federal
employees
do,
and
that's
what
you
have
to
use
as
well.
i
think
because
it's
so
hard
to
know
the
facts
there,
deference
to
congress
is
appropriate.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
that
would
be
very
doubtful,
but
i'm
almost
positive
that
those
would
not
be
the
facts
here.
there
are
people
who
have
hobbies,
and
there
are
people
who
make
some
money
on
their
hobbies
by
giving
speeches
or
writing
articles,
but
i
think
it
is
almost
worthy
of
judicial
notice
that
it's
much,
much
more
likely
that
people
will
speak
about
their
work,
the
things
that
they
do
for
most
of
their
time,
and
that
the
dangers
of
permitting
honoraria
generally
are
much
more
federal
employees
who
would
be
paid
to
speak
about
their
work,
be
paid
to
speak
about
the
things
that
they
work
on,
than
things
that
are
just
hobbies
for
them.
mr.
paul
bender
there
is
certainly
some
heightened
form
of
scrutiny,
but
i
think
two
things,
and
as
i
said
before,
i
think
if
this
statute
were
a
prohibition
on
conduct
of
non-government
employees,
or
even
perhaps
a
prohibition
on
conduct
of
government
employees,
the
answer
might
be
different.
but
here,
i
think
two
factors
which
go
to
permitting
congress
to
do
this
are
1)
that
this
does
not
prohibit
any
speech
at
all,
it
prohibits
compensation
for
speech,
and
these
are
all
people
who
have
another
job,
and
so
it
is
unlikely
in
many
cases
that
the
compensation
will
in
any
sense
be
necessary
to
permit
them
to
give
the
speech,
and
if
it
is
necessary
to
permit
them
to
give
the
speech,
that
raises
other
problems.
with
federal
employees
dependent
upon
this
kind
of
outside
income,
i
think
congress
could
be
worried
about
that.
mr.
paul
bender
i'm
sure
that
that's
true,
because
there
are
some
people
who
will
not
do
it,
and
that
is...
there's
no
question
about
that.
i
think
the
closest
analogy
in
this
court's
history
are
the
hatch
act
cases,
where
i
think
you
could
similarly
say,
as
we
all
have
said
about
this,
that
there
are
some
things
that
the
hatch
act
prohibits
that
really
don't
cause
any
danger
at
all,
but
congress,
rather
than
drawing
the
lines
at
which
kind
of
political
campaigning
cause
the
problem
and
what
offices
there
was
political
pressure
by
superiors
on
inferior
people,
instead
of
drawing
those
lines,
congress
decided
that
it
wanted
to
ban
the
whole
thing.
mr.
paul
bender
two--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
two
things
about
that,
justice
breyer.
1)
i
don't
think
the
court
said
in
the
son
of
sam
case
that
a
triple
ax
murderer
could
not
be
prohibited.
it
said--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
statute
was
overbroad.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
court
has
always
given
congress
a
lot
more
discretion
in
dealing
with
regulating
the
activities
of
federal
employees,
and
the
hatch
act
case
again
shows
that.
you
could
obviously
not
prohibit
the
kind
of
activity
the
hatch
act
prohibits
for
federal
employees
if
you
were
prohibiting
it
for
people
generally.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
it
is
greater,
and
a
statute
that
was
tailored
to
the
serious
criminals
would
be
constitutional.
but
let's
come
back
to
the
example
of...
let's
come
back
to
the
example
of
the
person
writing
an
article.
first
of
all--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
statute
does
not
prohibit
writing
the
article.
the
statute
prohibits
being
paid
for
it.
that
may
seem
totally
innocent,
and
in
most
cases,
and
in
probably
an
overwhelming
number
of
cases,
it
will
be
totally
innocent.
but
suppose
the
article
is
being
paid
for
by
someone
who
has
business
before
the
agency?
then,
i
think,
it
would
raise
problems.
congress
i
think
was
worried,
and
i
think
it
is
proper
for
them
to
be
worried,
about
who
was
going
to
supervise
that.
how
will
you
know
that
the
speaker
chairman
of
the
garden
club
who
hires
a
secretary
in
the
justice
department
to
give
a
talk
about
how
to
grow
roses
does
not
have
business
before
the
justice
department
and
wants
the
secretary
help
him
to
get
an
appointment
with
some
officials?
you
could
have
written
a
statute
which
said,
it
turns
on
that,
which
would
mean
that
government
ethics
officials
in
each
agency
would
have
to
enforce
that.
one
of
the
problems
that
congress
knew
about
was
the
unevenness
of
enforcement
of
these
ethical
regulations
in
different
agencies
if
you
permit
them
to
be
enforced
by
the
people
in
the
agencies,
and
congress
thought
it
was
worth...
and
they
must
have
known
that
they
were
trenching
on
some
ground
where
they
would
be
stopping
people
from
speaking
and
where
there
would
be
no
reason
for
doing
it
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think--
mr.
paul
bender
--yes.
i
think
that
it's...
that's
a
way
of
saying
it
in
a
way
that
kind
of
denigrates
it
as
an
interest.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
it's...
i
think
it's
administrative
efficiency
is
a
label.
there's
a
reality
behind
that
label.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
very
difficult,
and
i
think
it's
because
it's
very
difficult
that
unless
it
appears
very
clearly
that
congress
weighed
it
incorrectly,
the
court
should
defer
to
congress'
judgment
that
that's
the
way
to
do
it.
congress
considered
putting
a
nexus
provision
in.
it
thought
about
it
and
decided
not
to
do
that.
i
think
that
their
knowledge
of
the
federal
system,
their
knowledge
of
the
pressures
on
employees,
and
their
knowledge
of
the
dangers
and
their
sense
of
the
public
perception
of
the
dangers--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
i
think
there's...
there
is
some
heightened
scrutiny.
it
is
hard
to
say
exactly
what
that
is.
i
think
it--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
there
would
be
many,
many
more
cases
that
would
have
to
be
screened.
that's
one
thing,
because
there
are
many
less
series
of
speeches
than
there
are
individual
speeches
and
appearances,
and
articles,
and
as
i
said,
with
a
series,
it
is
usually
possible
to
tell
the
subject
matter
of
the
series
with
some
confidence
from
some
written
materials.
that's
much
harder
to
do
with
a
single
speech
or
a
single
appearance,
so
i
think
the
administrative
problems
would
be
greater.
just
one
more
word
about...
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
souter,
i
think
one
way
that
a
heightened
scrutiny
shows
up
is
in
the
question
justice
kennedy
asked
about
what
percentage
would
have
to
be
overbroad
to
strike
it
down.
i
think
that
if
the
statute
didn't
involve
speech,
and
there
was
any
conceivable,
rational
objective
that
congress
was
pursuing,
one
would
uphold
it
here.
i
think
if
the
court
were
convinced
that
95
percent
of
the
statute's
application
was
on
speech
that
caused
absolutely
no
danger
of
a
public
perception
of
lack
of
integrity,
then
you
would
strike
it
down,
whereas
if
it
weren't
speech,
then
i
think
you
wouldn't
strike
it
down.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
the
problem,
though,
with
that,
is
it...
the
prior
experience
is
very
uneven.
some
agencies
are
quite
strong
and
concerned
about
applying
these
ethics
regulations.
mr.
paul
bender
other
agencies
are
not.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
i
don't
know
that
there
are
any
figures
collected.
at
least,
i
was
not
able
to
get
any
central
figures
collected
about
how
many
of
these
requests
were
made,
or
how
much
investigation
was
done
at
the
particular
agency
level,
because
the
immediate
enforcement
of
this
statute
is
at
the
agency
level.
the
office
of
government
ethics
does
not
do
a
comprehensive
screening.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
not
that
the
government
would
prefer
it,
it's
that
i
think
congress
deserves
that
recognition.
it's
clear
to
me
that
if--
mr.
paul
bender
--of
course
it
does.
mr.
paul
bender
there
is.
mr.
paul
bender
if
it
was
95-percent
overbroad,
or
if
you
couldn't
easily
separate
the
constitutional
from
the
unconstitutional
applications,
then
i
think
you
might
strike
the
statute
down,
but
here
it's
quite
easy.
mr.
paul
bender
sometimes
it's--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
in
the--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
court
has
said
that--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
court
has
said
repeatedly
since
broadrick
that
it
will
use
the
overbreadth
doctrine
only
as
a
last
resort,
that
it
is
very
strong
medicine
to
be
reserved
for
very
unusual
cases.
this
court,
for
example,
in
holding
that
the
statute--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
substantial
in
comparison
to
the
part
of
the
statute
that
is
constitutional?
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
substantial.
i
would
guess
that
there
is
a
much
smaller
number
of
these
speeches
made
on
topics
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
person's
work
than
there
would
be
speeches
made
for
compensation
on
topics
that
have
something
to
do
with
a
person's
work,
so
i
don't
think
it's
substantial
in
that
sense.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
paul
bender
with
regard
to
the
commission
reports,
on
page
8
of
our
reply
brief,
we
quote
a
paragraph
from
both
of
the
commission
reports,
which
says
that
honoraria
should
be
defined
so
as
to
close
present
and
potential
loopholes.
they
mentioned
more
loopholes
there
than
congress
decided
to
close,
but
i
think
the
spirit
of
those
reports
was
the
prophylactic
spirit
that
the
statute
has.
with
regard
to
the
standard--
mr.
paul
bender
--no.
those
were
addressed
to
all
three
branches.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
if
you--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
but
there
are
people
who
work
in
the
legislative
branch
who
are
at
the
lowest
levels
and
people
who
work
in
the
judicial
branch,
there
are
secretaries
and
file
clerks
who
work
there,
and
there
are
people
who
work
in
the
executive
branch
at
the
highest
levels
where
i
think
the
problems
are
the
same,
so
i
don't
think
there's
a
major
difference
there.
thank
you.
