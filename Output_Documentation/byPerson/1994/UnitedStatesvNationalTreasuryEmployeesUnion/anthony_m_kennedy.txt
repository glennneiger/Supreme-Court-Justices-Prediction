justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
answer
to
that
question,
whether
or
not
congress
has
the
constitutional
authority
to
do
this,
turn
in
part,
or
in
large
part,
on
an
assessment,
either
by
us
or
by
the
congress,
as
to
how
often
these
speeches
do,
in
fact,
implicate
the
interest
that
the
government
is
wishing
to
vindicate
and
to
protect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
and
what
kind
of
empirical
data
do
we
have
to
make
that
assessment,
or
did
congress
have
to
make
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
thought,
or
the
congress
thought,
that
the
improper
kind
of
speaking
takes
place
only
5
percent
of
the
time,
would
that
have
been
enough
to
sustain
this
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
we're
making
this
assessment
and
this
evaluation,
since
speech
is
involved,
is
there
some
heightened
form
of
scrutiny?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
your
position
that
the
statute
would
be
more
defensible
if
the
series
exception
were
not
in
the
statute
and
there
were
just
a
blanket
prohibition,
whether
or
not
it
was
a
series?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
statute
is
the
more
defensible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
statute
is
the
more
defensible
from
the
government's
standpoint?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
trading
on
the
job
in
the
sense
that
what
you
have
learned
on
the
job,
you're
profiting
from?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'd
like
to
know
what
your
position
would
be
if
congress
passed
a
statute,
a
hypothetical,
that
for
a
period
of
10
years
after
you
leave
the
government
you
may
not
write
about
what
you
learned
at
the
agency.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
there
you
see
the
nexus
between
the
evil
prohibited
and
the
statutory
remedy
was
existent.
it
was
extant.
it
was
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
here,
we're
asking
whether
or
not
there
should
be
heightened
scrutiny
in
order
to
compel
the
government
to
justify
what
its
interest
is
as
to
each
speech,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
does
require
heightened
scrutiny.
i'm
quite
surprised
you
say
that
no
heightened
scrutiny
is
required--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
you...
and
in
connick,
i...
because
you're
going
to
be
discussing
this
case
as
well,
connick
was
a
case,
and
that
line
of
cases,
in
which
the
speech
was
directly
linked
by
the
public
to
the
employment,
which
is
not
the
case
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
have
cases
of
people
writing
about
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
government,
and
you
say
there's
no
heightened
scrutiny?
