justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
you
explain
something
to
me?
i
really
have
to
say
i'm
kind
of
puzzled
about
the
reason
why
the
content
of
the
speech
or
writing
makes
any
difference
at
all.
if
you
want
to
curry
favor
with
someone
by
paying
them
something
that
they
haven't
really
earned,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
they
write
a
lyric
poem,
a
mystery
story,
or
talk
about
what
they
do
every
day
at
the
office?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
that
insofar
as
your
concern
with
corruption,
the
subject
matter
doesn't
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it,
mr.
bender,
you
would
admit,
would
you
not,
that
the
net
effect
of
the
statute
is
to
decrease
the
quantity
of
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
different
than
if
you
wait
until
you
retire
and
then
write
your
memoirs?
right.
to
do
that...
general
grant
did
that.
i
mean,
what's
wrong
with
that?
i
must
confess--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
just
an
appearance
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--everything
is
in
the
public
domain
that
this
person
is
talking
about.
you're
not
talking
about
revealing
government
secrets,
or
judicial
secrets.
you
might
be
a
heart
surgeon
out
at
bethesda,
you've
had
a
lot
of
cases
and
learned
about
it,
you
want
to
give
lectures
to
heart
surgeons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
what's
wrong
with
that.
