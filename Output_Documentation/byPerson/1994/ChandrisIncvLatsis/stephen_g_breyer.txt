justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
why
i
didn't
really
see
the
difference
between
the
briefs.
i
mean,
i
know
this
must
be
my
fault,
but
they...
it
seems
to
me
it
comes
down
to
whether
the
perils
of
the
sea,
and
they
say
the
hazards
of
the
sea,
and
then
later
on
they
define
hazards
of
the
sea
to
be
deep
sea
perils
and
the
dangers
incident
to
the
movement
of
vessels
on
navigable
waters,
and
once
i
saw
that,
it
seemed
to
me,
what's
the
difference?
i
take
it
what
you're
trying
to
get
at
is,
there
are
people
who
wear
blue
suits,
used
to
put
up
sails,
work
on
the
motors,
everyone
would
say
they're
seamen,
and
they're
covered
all
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
there
are
some
other
people
like
a
welder,
who
may
come
on
the
ship
when
it's
at
the
dock,
and
the
question,
suppose
the
ship,
while
the
welder's
on
it,
goes
out
on
a
little
trip,
and
he
keeps
welding.
well,
common
sense
would
say
he
should
be
covered
while
he's
out
there
but
not
when
he
gets
back
to
the
dock.
and
then
we're
trying
to
get
a
test
to
work
that
out.
my
questions,
i
guess,
are,
is
that
right,
and
if
that's
not
right,
still,
what's
the
difference
between
your
two
tests?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
regularly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that--
--why
is
that?
i
mean,
why
is
it
in
the
law...
why
is
it
that
a
person
couldn't,
for
example,
be
a
welder,
and
then
he
says,
i'm
going
to
sign
up
now
to
help
with
this
ship,
and
he
goes
on
the
ship
and
pulls
the
ropes
and
everything--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
why
do
you
have
to
say
that
while
he's
on
the
shore
and
doing
the
welding
at
the
dock,
he's
the
one
thing,
and
then
when
he
goes
out
to
sea
we
couldn't
say
he's
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
exactly
what
i
wondered
in
the
second
circuit
test.
that
is
to
say,
they
talk
about
a
person,
other
things
being
satisfied,
that
he
either...
he
makes
a
contribution
that
is
substantial
either
in
respect
to
duration,
or
nature.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i'm
thinking,
what
about
our
welder?
ninety-nine
percent
of
his
time
he's
at
the
dock.
one
day,
he's
repairing
the
bulkhead
and
they
say,
come
with
us,
continue
to
do
it
while
we
go
to
hamburg.
now,
reading
that
test,
i
thought
it
would
cover
him
while
he
is
making
a
substantial
contribution
in
terms
of
nature,
though
not
of
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
therefore
he
would
be
covered.
but
when
he
got
back
to
the
shore,
and
he
got
off
the
boat,
and
he
went
back
to
his
normal
welding
facilities,
he's
no
longer
covered,
while,
on
the
other
hand,
the
seaman,
who's
there
because
of
duration,
i.e.,
the
real
sailor,
is
covered
always.
now,
that's
how
i
was
reading
that,
and
that's
why
i
started
out
with
justice
souter's
idea.
perhaps
that
would
work.
but
now
from
various...
i'm
quite
shaken
as
to
whether
that
works
or
doesn't
work.
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
second
circuit
is
saying.
well,
regardless--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
how
could
we
do
that?
what
i'm
basically
getting
at
is,
i
don't
understand
why
the
welder
shouldn't
be
covered
when
he's
out
there
in
the
ocean.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
can
perfectly
well
understand
why
he
shouldn't
be
covered
once
he
comes
back
to
the
dock.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
does
the
law
work
in
order
to
achieve
that
result
without
cutting
off
the
person
with
the
blue...
you
want
him
to
be
covered
when
he
comes
back
to
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
how
does
it
work,
this
statute,
to
get
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
you
don't
permit
the
in-and-out,
then
a
person
who
goes
on
one
trip
to
hamburg,
and
he
has
a
blue
suit,
he
puts
up
the
sails,
he
steers
the
ship,
he
repairs
the
engine,
he
rows
half
the
way--
[laughter]
he
is
not
covered
under
the
act,
because
you'd
call
him
not
a
seaman?
i
mean,
that's
what
to
me
makes
very
little
sense,
frankly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
isn't
justice
souter's
approach
a
way
of
dealing
with
it,
though
it
has
justice
scalia's
cost?
