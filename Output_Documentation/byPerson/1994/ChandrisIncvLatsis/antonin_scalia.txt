you
mean,
he
can
work
in
a
skyscraper
in
manhattan...
i
guess
the
individual
here
worked
in
new
york
most
of
the
time.
is
that...
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you
had
the
right
computer
hookup,
you
could
really
be
in
manhattan
in
a
high
rise
office
building
and
still
be
a
longshoreman.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
before
you
get
to
the
example,
i'm
not
following
the
discussion,
because
i
had
been
under
the
impression
that
you
can't
be
a
long...
a
seaman
for
purposes
of
the
voyage,
that
it
is
an
employment
status;
that
you
are
either
a
seaman,
or
you
are
not
a
seaman.
and
if
you
are
a
seaman,
and
have
made
one
voyage,
that
makes
you
a
seaman.
you
remain
a
seaman
when
you're
back
in
manhattan.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
you
get
injured
in
the
office
building,
because
of
that
one
voyage...
is
that
what
the
second
circuit
does
with
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
but
the
second
circuit's
test
would
say
you
can
be
a
seaman
for
one
voyage,
and
then
when
you
go
back
to
land,
you're
no
longer
under
the
jones
act
and
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
a
complicat...
it
seems
to
me,
if
you're
being
consistent
to
your
argument,
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
has
to
be
no,
that
it
is
irrelevant
where
the
injury
happened
to
occur.
the
individual
is
either
a
seaman
or
not
a
seaman.
now,
it
may
tug
at
the
heartstrings,
and
it
may
be
a...
you
know,
an
emotionally
significant
factor,
but
as
i
understand
your
theory,
the
question
is
whether
the
individual
is
normally
doing
the
work
of
a
seaman,
and
if
not,
even
if
he
happens
to
have
been
injured
at
sea,
during
a
voyage,
it
should
make
no
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
does
not
strike
me
as
a
very
happy
system
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
he
can't
go
in
and
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
your
position
was
you
cannot
cover
someone
just
for
a
voyage,
and
then
when
he
comes
back
he
goes
out
of
his
jones
act
status.
if
he
has
the
status,
he
has
it
for
his
entire
employment.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it
was
the
company's
car?
what
if
it
was
the
company's
car,
and
it
was
negligent?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he's
on
land--
justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
that
affected
by
where
he's
injured?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
that
affected
by
where
he
is
injured?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
find
it
compelling
at
all.
i...
why
is
it
compelling--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
what
you're
looking
for
is
status,
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
individual's
employment
status
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
based
on
his
job
description,
not
where
the
injury
occurs.
justice
antonin
scalia
fine.
well,
what
about
flipping
a
coin?
that's
a
good
tie-breaker,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
why
do
you
seize
upon
the
place
of
the
injury?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
find
it
compelling
that
he
was
sitting
at
his
desk?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why
do
you
find
it
compelling
when
he's
sitting
on
the
boat?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
the
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
it's
very
close
whether
he's
a
seaman
or
not,
in
which
case,
you
ought
to
find
the
fact
that
he
was
on
land
compelling.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
have
really
lost
the
thread
of
the
disagreement,
then,
between
you
and
the
other
side
of
the
case.
you
both
agree
that
it
has
to
be
regularly,
that
the
individual
does
not
occupy
seaman
status
unless
he's
regularly
at
sea,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
nifty,
but
people
always
come
in
and
say,
whenever
they
go
to
sea,
they
say,
well,
this
was
a
new
job.
i
mean,
there's
no
end
to
the
litigation
over
that,
when
everybody's
going
to
claim
that
as
soon
as
he
gets
assigned
in
the
course
of
any
employment,
to
go
on
a
ship,
well,
that
was
a
new
job.
