justice
anthony
m.

i
take
it
the
situs
of
the
injury,
the
fact
that
it
occurred
on
a
voyage,
is
relevant,
is
one
of
the
factors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
a
close
case,
where
the
claimant
is
arguing
for
seaman's
status,
is
it
relevant
that
the
injury
occurred
on
the
vessel
on
a
voyage?
that's
where
justice
souter
was
leading.
it
seems
to
me
there
may
be
a
category
of
easier
cases,
and
we
can
say
that
in
a
close
case
this
can
be
the
dispositive
factor.
it
occurred
on
the
voyage,
where
he's
subject
to
the
perils
of
the
sea,
he's
got
to
do
what
the
ship's
doctor
says,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
not
only
intuitive,
but
it
has
some
bearing
on
the
rationale
for
the
act,
which
is
that
the
seaman
is
subject
to
the
discipline
of
the
ship,
the
orders
of
the
ship's
doctor,
et
cetera,
which
is
precisely
why
we
have
seaman's
status
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
it
is
a
weighty
factor,
not
the
sole
factor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
--well,
then
you
have
to
retract
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
who
suggested
to
you,
shouldn't
we
be
able
to
know,
before
the
voyage
ever
occurs,
by
looking
at
the
person's
job
description,
whether
or
not
he
or
she
is
a
seaman?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
one
of
the
fatal--
--i
think
it's
relevant
to
what
we're
considering
here.
i
mean,
the
concession
you've
made
with
regard
to
the
place
of
the
injury,
because
frankly,
i
thought
the
strongest
part
of
your
case
was
the
necessity
for
the
employer
to
be
able
to
tell
whether
the
employee
is
a
jones
act
employee,
or
not
a
jones
act
employee,
and
i
thought
we
had
two
categories
of
people.
you
could
study
the
person's
job
and
decide
he
was
or
he
wasn't.
but
you
have
now
told
us
that
there
are
three
categories
of
employees.
there
are
those
who
are
clearly
jones
act,
there
are
those
who
are
clearly
not
jones
act,
and
there
is
a
third
category
where
it's
too
close
to
call,
as
justice
kennedy
says,
and
they
either
are
or
are
not
jones
act,
depending
upon
where
they
get
injured.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
are
the
two
fatal
flaws
that
you
were
going
to
tell
us
about
at
the
very
beginning--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
your
argument?
all
right.
and
is
there
anything
wrong
with
covering
the
welder
if,
in
fact,
he
does
go
out
on
this
mission,
and
they
sail
about
1,000
miles,
and
he
sits
there
and
welds?
i
can
see
there
would
be
something
wrong
with
covering
him
once
he
comes
back
to
shore,
but
is
there
anything
wrong
with
covering
him
while
he's
at
sea?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
our
law
indicates
that
you
cannot
go
in
and
out
of
seaman
and
longshore
status?
