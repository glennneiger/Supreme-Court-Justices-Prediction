chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-325,
chandris
v.
latsis.
mr.
mccreadie.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
technically
correct
to
say
he
was...
i
mean,
he
wasn't
getting
down
there
and
soldering
any
wires
himself,
was
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
was
a
supervising
engineer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
virtual
reality.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
well,
mr.
mccreadie,
enlighten
me,
if
a
seaman
is
on
land,
and
is
injured,
say,
by
a
negligent
automobile
driver,
can
he
recover
from
the
ship's
owner?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you've
taken
several
different
positions
here.
first,
you
seemed
to
agree
with
justice
kennedy,
and
then
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
and
justice
ginsburg's
questions,
you
say
it
was
irrelevant
that...
and
now
you
say
it's
a
permissible
tie-breaker.
you've
taken
three
different
positions.
which
do
you
end
up
with?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mccreadie.
mr.
rosenberg,
we'll
hear
from
you.
would
you
enlighten
me
on
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
mccreadie?
i'll
detail
it
more.
supposing
that
someone
who
is
concededly
a
seaman
is
on
a
ship
which
ends
a
voyage
at
boston,
and
he
lives
in
boston.
he's
walking
down
washington
street
and
is
run
over
by
a
car,
and
the
ship
is
going
to
sail
next
week.
he's
just
home
for
a
week.
is
the
ship
owner
liable
to
him
for
any
damages
under
the
jones
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
a--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
if
the
shipping
company
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
car
that
ran
him
over
on
washington
street,
it's
not
responsible--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--under
the
jones
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
are
rather
extreme
decisions,
though,
some
30
years
ago,
weren't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
he
on
the
ship
during
the
6
months
it
was
in
the
drydock?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
didn't
live
on
the
ship?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
of
the
risks
of
the
sea
is
you
get
a
bad
ship's
doctor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
second
circuit's
opinion
say
it
felt
this
was
a
very
close
case
that
needed
a
tie-breaker?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
term,
ship's
engineer
has
a
somewhat
different
connotation,
doesn't
it,
than
mr.
latsis'
profession?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
the
nonsupervisory,
laboring-in-the-vineyard
type
engineers
do
on
board
a
vessel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
engineers
operate
the
ship's
machinery,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
in
effect
accepted
the
second
circuit's
position
for
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you're
faced
with
your
opponent
who
says
it
should
be
a
much
narrower
definition
of
seaman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
presumably,
neither
of
you
would
think
it
would
cover
the
welder
who
went
to
hamburg.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
he
frequently
went
to
hamburg?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
could
all
agree
to
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
said
if
he
frequently
went
to
hamburg,
i
think
we
could
all
agree--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
there
should
be
a
new
trial
even
though
we
were
to
adopt
the
fifth
circuit
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosenberg.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
is
number
94-325
chandris,
inc.
versus
latsis.
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
resolve
the
longstanding
conflict
among
the
federal
courts
concerning
the
definition
of
seaman
under
the
jones
act.
the
jones
act
was
enacted
in
1920
and
it
gives
heightened
legal
protection
to
seaman
because
of
their
exposure
to
the
perils
of
the
sea.
but
it
doesn't
say
what
a
seaman
is?
and
therefore
it
leaves
to
courts
the
task
of
deciding
what
it
is.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
o?connor
and
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
survey
our
past
cases,
the
history
of
the
federal
statutory
scheme
and
the
experience
of
the
various
courts
of
appeals
in
dealing
with
these
issues.
we
ultimately
conclude
that
the
employment
related
connection
to
a
vessel
and
navigation
necessary
for
seaman
status
is
made
up
of
two
elements.
first,
the
workers
duties
have
to
contribute
to
the
function
of
vessel
or
to
the
accomplishments
of
its
mission
and
second
the
worker's
has
to
have
a
connection
to
a
vessel
that
is
substantial
in
terms
of
both
duration
and
nature.
in
reaching
this
conclusion
we
reject
the
respondent's
suggestion
that
we
adapt
a
voyage
test
under
which
anyone
working
on
boarder
ship
for
the
duration
of
a
voyage
would
qualify
as
the
seaman.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
and
justice
breyer
joined.
