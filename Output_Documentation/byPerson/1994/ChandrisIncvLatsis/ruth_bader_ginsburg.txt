mr.
mccreadie,
i
thought
i
had
your
position
right,
but
from
what
you're
saying
now,
i'm
not
clear.
i
thought
your
position
is
you
could
type
every
person,
every
employee.
before
the
accident
occurs,
you
say,
tell
me
what
latsis'
work
is,
and
i
will
tell
you
whether
he's
a
seaman
or
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that,
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
on
your
theory
it
should
be
irrelevant
whether
latsis
was
injured
in
a
sea
storm,
because
you
know
from
day
1,
based
on
the
obligations
and
duties
of
his
job,
that
he
will
not
be
a
sailor.
i
thought
that
was
your
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
position
is,
it's
not
even
a
relevant
factor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
think
mr.
mccreadie
was
mentioning
that
he
would
be
typed
a
sailor
for
purposes
of
other
relief
like
maintenance
and
cure.
he'd
get
maintenance
and
cure,
wouldn't
he,
if
he
had
a
sailor
status?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
he
wouldn't
have,
if
he
didn't
have
sailor
status.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
there's
no
question
of
negligence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't
judge
oaks
say
that
if
the
accident
had
happened
while
the
boat
was
in
drydock,
maybe
latsis
would
not
have
been
a
sailor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
it
was
an
open
question,
then
he
had
to
at
least
have
contemplated
the
possibility
that
latsis
is
a
seaman
sometimes
and
not
a
seaman
at
other
times.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
second
circuit
was
concerned
with
the
error
in
an
instruction
to
the
jury--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
happened
to
be
the
error
to
which
you...
the
instruction
about
permanent
connection
to
which
you
did
not
object.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so...
and
this
case
was
not...
it
was
not
determined
that
latsis
was
a
seaman.
it
was
sent
back
for
retrial
under
a
proper
instruction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosenberg,
we're
talking
about
a
charge
to
the
jury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
judge
oaks
wrote
a
charge
for
that
jury.
judge
kearse
agreed
that's
a
perfectly
fine
charge,
but
what
she
says,
it
wasn't
plain
error.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
either
the
fifth
circuit
words
are
right,
permanent,
or
the
second
circuit's
words
are
right,
substantial...
what
is
it
+/?
but
more
refinements
we
can't
give,
because
what
we're
talking
about
is,
what
was
the
correct
charge--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
a
jury
to
be
given,
in
the
words
of
the
fifth
circuit,
or
in
the
words
of
the
second
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
nothing
more
elaborate
is
going
to
help
this
district
judge,
who
is
either
going
to
be
finished
with
the
case,
if
the
district
judge
is
right,
or
we'll
have
to
charge
another
jury,
if
we
uphold
the
second
circuit's
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosenberg--
--it
wasn't
a
new
job.
this
was
part
of
his
regular
job.
--you
answered...
you
gave
a
firm
answer
to
the
question,
there's
no
in-and-out
for
a
true
sailor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he's
assigned
to
land
for
2
months,
he
remains,
he's
ever
and
always
a
sailor.
now,
you
seem
to
be
shuffling
on
whether
somebody
who
is
not
that
traditional
sailor,
but
who
spends
a
considerable
amount
of
time
on
a
voyage,
can
be,
for
that
temporary
time,
a
sailor,
even
though
he's
going
to
go
back
on
shore
and
be
an
engineer
and
sit
in
his
office
in
miami,
and
maybe
fall
down
the
stairs
there.
is
latsis
ever
and
always
a
sailor,
or
can
he
be
a
sailor,
under
your
argument,
when
he's
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
on
the
way
to
bermuda,
and
yet
not
be
a
sailor
when
he
gets
back
to
his
office
in
miami
and
falls
down
the
stairs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
his
job
hasn't
changed.
he
occasionally
goes
on
ships,
but
he
spends
most
of
his
time
on
land.
are
you...
is
your
answer
yes,
you
must
type
him
as
either
a
sailor
or
not
so
that
just
as
when
he
had
the
detached
retina
in
the
middle
of
the
way
to
bermuda,
if
he
got
it
in
his
office
in
miami,
when
he
got
back,
he
would
still
be
a
sailor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
assuming
that
the
office
is
ill-equipped,
or
the
stairs
in
the
property
that
was
rented
by
the
employer
were
defected,
so
the
negligence
is
still
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
saying
that
this
man...
you
two
seem
to
agree,
then,
that
either
you're
a
sailor,
or
you're
not
a
sailor,
and
there's
no
in-and-out.
there's
no
welder
case
possible,
because
either
that
welder
is
always
a
sailor,
or
never
a
sailor.
