mr.
lewis
rosenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
was
thinking
about
answering
that
question
when
i
got
on
my
feet
immediately.
there's
an
important
element
necessary
in
the
jones
act
before
an
employee
can
bring
suit
successfully.
he
must
show
that
the
employer
is
negligent.
it's
not
a--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--no-fault
system.
he
must
establish
that
there's
some
neglect
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
exactly.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
exactly,
your
honor.
there's
no...
they
control
their
risk.
it's
not
something
that
makes
them
a
guarantor
of
the
safety
of
all
their
employees.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
and
it
was
negligent--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--then
the
employer
would
be
liable.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
of
course,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--exactly.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
that's
right.
that's
right,
and
that's
an
important
feature
of
it.
if
i
might
just
digress
just
for
a
moment
from
the
discussion
about
the
particular
test
to
be
applied
to
something
of
a
very
important
nature
with
regard
to
the
status
of
this
appeal
that
i
think
i
should
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention,
the
decision
below
is
based
upon
two
independent
bases.
one
of
them,
of
course,
is
what
we've
been
focusing
on
so
far,
which
test
to
be
applied,
but
there's
another
one
as
well,
and
that
has
not
been
addressed
in
the
petition,
nor
has
it
been
addressed
in
the
brief
on
the
merits,
and
that
is
to
say,
the
second
circuit's
holding
that
the
trial
judge
was
in
error
in
instructing
this
jury
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
vessel
was
out
of
navigation
when
it
was
in
drydock
in
germany,
and
that
is
an
independent
basis
for
the
court's
decision,
and
it
has
not
been
addressed
in
the
petition
nor
in
the
brief
on
the
merits.
now,
i'm
prepared...
and
we
have
addressed
that
merits
of
that
position
in
our
brief,
because
we
support
it.
there
are
two
cases
of
this
court
that
support
that
position,
and
are
very
important
in
the
jones
act
and
the
evolution
of
the
jones
act
which
was
cited
in
the
wilander
case,
and
those
are
the
senko
cases
and
the
butler
case.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
well,
i
would
not
characterize
them
as
extreme,
because
they've
been
guiding
courts
all
along
since
that
time,
in
terms
of
coverage,
but
just
let's
examine
factually
what
butler
involved
and
see
how
it
fits
in
with
the
situation
at
hand.
in
butler,
there
was
a
tugboat
that
had
not
been
moved
in
the
year
in
question,
except
when
it
was
towed
to
a
drydock.
it
was,
i
guess,
effectively
decommissioned.
it
was
awaiting
coast
guard
inspection,
it
had
no
captain,
it
had
no
other
crew
members
except
a
laborer
who
was
assigned
to
it,
and
the
laborer
was
mysteriously
found
drowned,
and
the
assumption
was
that
he
had
somehow
fallen
from
a
gangplank.
now,
that
vessel,
this
court
held,
that
question
as
to
whether
that
vessel
was
or
was
not
in
navigation
was
a
question
for
a
jury,
in
the
same
way
that
the
second
circuit
held
that
whether
or
not
that
drydock,
6
months,
with
very
close
planning,
which
had
a
crew
on
board,
where
mr.
latsis
was,
i
contend,
one
of
the
crew
members
on
that
boat,
on
that
ship
for
that
period
of
time,
they
executed
a
plan
where
they
restored
that
vessel
in
6
months
and
she
was
on
her
way,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
latsis
attended
the
shakedown
cruise,
and
when
they
put
it
back
into
drydock
in
norfolk--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--he
worked
on
that
ship
for
6
months,
7...
the
testimony
is,
7
days
a
week
for
6
months,
from
early
in
the
morning
to
11:00
at
night.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
he
didn't
live
on
the
ship,
no.
there
were
some...
there
were
some
personnel
living
on
the
ship.
he
was
not
one
of
the
personnel
that
was
accommodated
on
the
ship,
but
nonetheless,
that
certainly
shows
a
very
intimate
connection.
now,
if
this
court
is
going
to
reverse
the
second
circuit,
considering
that
finding,
it's
going
to
do
so
without
considering
this
point
as
to
whether
the...
this
court's
prior
holdings
have
vitality,
without
anybody
briefing
this
point,
and
i
think
it's
elementary
in
procedure
before
this
court
that
before
you
take
such
action,
reversing
precedent,
even
if
it's
old
precedent,
your
honor...
it's
old,
but
it
was
cited
in
wilander,
in
the
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court.
wilander
took
cognizance
of
both
senko
and
butler,
and
the
efficacy
of
the
rules
laid
down
there,
and
i
don't
think
that
was
a
casual
observation
that
was
made.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
he
said
it
was
an
open
question.
he
said,
whether...
in
those
circumstances
an
employee
connected
to
that
vessel
might
or
might--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--i
think
what
he
meant
by
that
is,
how
substantial
was
the
association
of
mr.
latsis
to
that
vessel
during
that
period
of
time,
in
the
context
of
his
whole
employment?
in
other
words,
the--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--excuse
me?
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
well,
you
know,
there
was
an
issue
raised
about
the
intuitive
approach
to
these
kind
of
cases.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
fifth
circuit
used
those
very
words
when
it
rejected
affording
seaman
status
to
pilots,
which
forever
have
always
been
considered
seamen.
but
in
any
event,
to
address
that
point,
i
think
it's
very
compelling.
it's
a
tie-breaker,
as
justice
souter
pointed
out.
the
man
was
enduring
the
risk
that--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--well,
because--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--certainly,
status.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
the
purpose
of
the
jones
act--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--as
everyone
has
pointed
out,
your
honor,
there
are
close
cases,
a
lot
of
close
cases.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--it's
not
merely
the
place
of
the
injury,
your
honor,
but
the
risk
associated.
in
other
words,
this
was,
according
to
the
second
circuit,
and
i
think
logically
it
follows,
a
risk
of
the
employment,
of
being
involved
in
a
vessel
underway
on
the
sea,
and
that's
what's
compelling
about
it.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
if
you
assume
that
somehow
or
other
the
doctor
was
neglectful
in
treating
him
in
that
context,
yes.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
yes.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
no.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
because--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--if
he
was
sitting
on
a
dock,
your
honor,
he
would
have
alternatives.
if
he
had
some
question
about
the
competence
of
that
physician,
and
if
you
read
the
record
in
this
case
you'd
have
questions
about
the
competence
of
this
physician,
he
could
go
somewhere
else.
he
wasn't
bound
to
accept
only
the
medical
care
that
was
afforded
him
by
this
particular
physician.
he
wouldn't
have
that
risk
of
the
sea.
he
wouldn't
realize
injury
as
a
result
of
the
risk
of
the
sea.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
no.
i
think
a
risk
of
the
sea
is
something
that,
because
of
the
confinement,
you're
restricted
to
whatever's
offered
to
you
in
that
context.
that's
why
it's
a
risk
of
the
sea,
your
honor.
it's
not--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--he
might.
i
mean,
to
step
out
of
the
record
again,
i
know
of
no...
he
has
not
made
any
application
for
that
coverage,
and--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--he
might
be,
but
he's
not
a
longshoreman,
that's
for
sure,
and
there
might
be
some
objection
to
his...
in
terms
of
the
employees
having
a
choice,
i'm
sure
he'd
prefer...
if
the
employee
had
control
of
choosing
whether
he
would
be
considered
a
jones
act
sailor--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--no.
then
i'm
sure--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--no,
it's
not.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
most
certainly.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
exactly,
your
honor.
exactly.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
well,
if
the
employer
had
a
choice--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--no,
the
employer.
the
employer
would
cap
his
liability,
obviously,
with...
i
mean,
it's
a
schedule.
it
says,
so
many
weeks
at
two-thirds
of...
if
he
lost
his
eye,
they'd
give
him
160
weeks...
two-thirds
of
160
weeks
of
his
salary
if
it's
a
total
loss
of
the
eye.
i
don't
know...
i'm
not
quite
sure
what--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--that's
right.
it's
not
a
no-fault
scheme,
the
jones
act.
you've
got
to
prove
negligence,
and
i
think
the
record
here
amply,
amply
supports
a
conclusion
that
there
was
negligence
here,
no
doubt
about
it.
in
the--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--yes.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
exactly.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
has
held
quite
the
same
in
a--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--it
might
be,
judge.
it
might
very
well
be.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
no.
that's
something
we've
introduced
into
the
concept.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
absolutely.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
yes,
in
several
facets.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
yes,
that's
quite
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
exactly,
under
the
test
of
the
second
circuit
as
modified
by
this
court's
holding
in
wilander
eliminating
the
requirement
that
the
employee
aid
in
navigation,
which
this
court
directed
no
longer
be
part
of
any
test
for
seaman
status,
that
there
are
others
besides
blue
water
sailors
that
are
covered
by
the
jones
act.
and
it's
clearly
contemplated
that...
for
instance,
in
enumerating
all
the
occupations
and
trades
that
historically
have
been
considered
as
seamen
before
the
jones
act
was
enacted,
and
that
was
the
starting
point
for
the
analysis
in
wilander,
there
have
been
engineers,
pilots,
and
all
kinds
of
occupations
that
have
been
said
to
have
contributed
to
the
mission
of
a
voyage
or
the
function
of
the
vessel,
and
those
alternatives
were
incorporated
into...
in
the...
universally
in
all
the
tests.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
mr.
latsis
was
a
supervising
engineer.
in
other
words,
he
supervised
the
engineers
that
were
on
board
the
vessel.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
well,
they
operate
the
engines.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
they
effectuate
repairs
at
sea
when
necessary.
they
coordinate,
or
make
suggestions,
but
ultimately
the
decisionmaking
is
mr.
latsis'
as
the
superintendent
engineer
as
to
how
to
execute
on...
and
they
accept
the
directions,
whether
they're
on
hand...
in
other
words,
mr.
latsis
regularly...
the
evidence
indicates
he
visited
these
ships
regularly
in
port,
and
also
traveled
with
them
at
sea.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
yes,
exactly.
they're
operating
engineers,
i
think,
in
a
major
way,
as...
the
railroad
used
to
have
engineers
on,
operating
engineers
as
well,
and
they're
fixed
plant
operating
engineers
as
well.
the
category,
engineer,
covers
a
lot
of
territory.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
under
the
longshoreman's
act,
yes,
sir.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
well--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--the
situs
is
the
area...
the
longshoreman,
as
the
act
has
indicated,
is
to
cover
principally...
the
impetus
for
the
enactment
was
to
cover
people
loading
and
unloading
materials
on
board
ships.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
don't
think
so.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
no,
it
wouldn't,
no.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
and
in
his
office
he
wouldn't
meet
it,
either.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
that's
true,
yes,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
case
that
was
not
mentioned
so
far,
a
recent
case
of
this
court,
gizoni,
a
ship
repairman,
where
the
employer
advocated
that
since
he
was
a
ship
repairman,
how
could
he
be
a
seaman?
well,
this
court
found
mr.
gizoni,
a
ship
repairman,
a
seaman
because
he
traveled
on
work
platforms
that
were
floating,
and
therefore
the
vessel
requirement
was
met,
even
though
it
was
several
vessels.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
yes,
i
do.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
correct.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
exactly.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
they
didn't
address
that,
no,
but
let
me
tell
you
that
there
is
a
case
in
this
court
that
was
decided
in
1959,
braen
v.
pfeifer,
which
is
cited
in
the
reply
brief...
we
didn't
cite
it
in
our
brief,
but
it's
in
the
reply
brief,
which
involved
a...
the
question
as
to
whether
you
could
step
out
of
seaman
status.
and
this
was
a...
this
was
someone
who
was
a
seaman,
and
he
was
assigned
to
nonseaman
duties,
and
the
question
was,
by
that
assignment,
would
that
take
him
out
of
seaman
status,
and
the
holding
was
that
it
was
not,
and
i
think
implicit
in
that
holding,
and
this
also
i
think
is
also
the
rationale
of
senko,
was
the
fact
that
it
was
an
intention
that
he
would
return
at
some
point,
that
he
was
destined
to
once
again
encounter
the
hazards
of
the
sea,
and
therefore
he
retains
that
seaman
status.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
i
think
he
should
be.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
if,
when
he
comes--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--exactly.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
if
the...
if
your
hypothetical
welder,
your
honor,
did
an
odd
job
at
sea,
so
he
wasn't
regularly...
that
wasn't
part
of
his
regular
employment,
that
was
extraordinary.
then
if
the
welding
job
at
hand
was
substantial,
he
would
become
a
seaman.
when
he
went
back,
however,
if...
in
proving
that
it
was
isolated,
did
not
ever
encounter
that
kind
of
risk
or
job
again,
or
was
not
intended
to,
nobody
planned
him
doing
that,
then
in
effect
his
job
changed,
and
he
lost
the
seaman
status
because
he's
no
longer--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--well--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--oh,
no.
that
has
not
occurred
as
yet,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
oh,
yes.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
exactly.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
well,
no,
i
do
like
it,
but
i
would
modify
the
word,
regular--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--no,
i
did
not,
no.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
not
if
that
was
isolated,
no.
no,
unless
we
wanted
to
modify
the
word,
regular,
to
mean
something
different
than
that,
nonsporadic,
or
non--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--i
think
so.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
unless...
with
the
proviso
that
there
was
some
recurrence
to
that
type
of--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--not
necessarily--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--hamburg,
but
some
place
where--
[laughter]
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
sure.
absolutely,
but
the
concept,
i
think,
is
that
it
was
not
isolated,
whether
it
was
hamburg
or
some
other
place
where
he
would
perform
that
function
while
at
sea.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
well,
we're
obliged
to
do
that
because
that's
what
the
second
circuit
said,
and
we're
supporting
the
second
circuit.
however,
that
term
regularly
has
not
been
defined
in
any...
to
any
degree,
and
i
think
contextually
the...
regularly
in
that
situation
means
not
sporadically,
not
spasmodically.
not
related
to
the
clock,
however,
because
that
was
the
one
thing
that
the
second
circuit
was
clear
in
rejecting,
that
having
a
time-only
index--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--yes.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
yes.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
exactly.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
exactly.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
except,
of
course,
that
other
point
i
brought
up,
your
honor,
that
in
addition,
judge
oaks'
opinion
states
it
was
error
to
have
excluded
from
the
jury's
consideration
the
period
of
time
the
vessel
was
in
drydock
from
their
determination
whether
mr.
latsis,
in
his
overall
employment,
had
a
substantial
connection
to
that
vessel.
the
second
circuit
held
that
error,
and
that
ruling
has
not
been
challenged
here,
so
in
effect
the
choices
i
see
before
the
court
are,
as
you
pointed
out,
your
honor,
the
fifth
circuit
test
or
the
second
circuit
test,
but
in
any
event
a
remand
and
a
new
trial,
and
that
seems
inevitable
on
the
state
of
this
record.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
but
the
fifth
circuit
test
was
not
always
so
time-oriented.
until
the
bach
case,
and
until
the
chevron
case,
the
fifth
circuit
was
not
so
narrowly
construing
that
test.
this
is
a
gloss
that
has
only
occurred,
relatively
speaking,
in
recent
times,
and
the
older
fifth
circuit
test,
where
that
emphasis
of
time
was
not
so
narrow,
is
very
much
the
same,
except
i
think
in
the
second
circuit
it's
more
well
articulated,
to
get
away
from
that
concept,
and
i
think
that
that--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--well,
if
the
hypothetical
we
presented
was
just
one
isolated
instance--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--i
had
assumed
that
since
there
was
a
port
mentioned
that
he
worked
only
at
that
destination,
and
not
en
route.
no.
if
that
were
true,
i
would...
i'd
say
that
the
welder
is
covered.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
yes.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
assuming
a
trip
was
finite,
it
wasn't
a
long,
you
know,
worldwide
cruise
kind
of
thing,
he
would
or
wouldn't
be
covered
under
that
test,
but
you
have
to
employ
that
term
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
that
requirement
was
made,
that
fourth
requirement.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
i
think
that
is--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--i
think
that
does,
because
that
clearly
defines
it
at
that
point.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
that's
right.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
well--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--i
think--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--i
think
that
justice
souter's
put
his
finger
on
something,
though.
this...
the
test
in
that
circumstances
would
be,
of
that
particular
employment,
but
the
nature
of
the
employment
changes.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
well,
judge,
there
are
other
requirements
besides
being
assigned
to
the
ship.
we're
talking
somebody
who's
involved--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--right.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
traditionally,
it
has
been
that
once
you
achieve
the
status
of
seaman,
you
don't
step
out
of
it,
as
long
as
that
continuity
of
the
duties
related
to
that
employment
continue,
but
people
do
change
jobs.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
oh,
he'd
still
be
a
sailor,
yes,
but
there's
no
negligence
of
an
employer
in
the
office
in
miami,
so
he
would--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--if
there's
negligence,
if
he's
a
seaman--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--that's...
that's--
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
--i
agree,
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
any
sense.
mr.
lewis
rosenberg
it
does,
but
there's
another
factor
i
think
we're
overlooking.
traditionally,
in
terms...
this
question
of
a
voyage
has
come
up,
and
it's
been
called
a
voyage
test,
and
except
in...
well,
even
in
modern
times,
but
at
the
times
under
consideration,
the
times
before
the
jones
act
was
enacted,
seaman,
blue
water
sailors
traditionally
would
sign
on
for
a
voyage.
in
this
court's
opinion
in
wilander,
it
cited
no
less
than
five
times
a
single
case
decided
by
the
district
court
in
new
york
by
judge
howe,
called
the
buena
ventura,
as
typifying
how
the
analysis
went
to
determine
who
was
a
seaman.
this
was
a
case--
