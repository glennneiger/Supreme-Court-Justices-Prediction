even
though
there
may
be
difficult
cases,
is
there
a
possibility
here
to
at
least
carve
out
a
category
of
easy
cases,
and
that
is,
if
we
assume
that
the
individual
is
employed
by
the
vessel
owner,
that
the
vessel
is
on
a
voyage,
which
i
take
it
this
one
indisputably
was,
that
the
person
is
supposed
to
do
some
work
for
the
vessel
owner
on
the
voyage...
he's
not
a
passenger,
and
he's
not
a
stowaway...
would
we
get
into
trouble
in
carving
out
a
central
category
in
that
case
when
all
those
conditions
are
met,
and
say
anyone
in
that
capacity
is
a
seaman
for
purposes
of
that
voyage?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
we
open
floodgates
to
more
litigation
over
the
issue,
or
just
open
floodgates
to
more
claimants
who
would
succeed
on
their
claims?
is
there
a
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
voyage
test
would
even
be
more
favorable--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
seamen
than
the
second
circuit
test
would
be.
is
there
a
textual
reason
why
the
voyage
test
is
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we're
going
on
and
on
and
on
now.
wherever
we
go,
we
seem
to
go
on
and
on
and
on,
and
is
there
a
textual
reason
why
the
voyage
test
is
impermissible?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
take
it
you're
telling
me
implicitly
that
there's
no
textual
reason
why
it's
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
keep
asking
you,
and
you...
there's
nothing
in
the
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
just
uses
the
word
seaman.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr....
i'm
sorry.
no,
you
go
ahead.
go
on...
go
on.
let
me
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question
with
a
slight
variation,
although
i'm
not
sure
it
really
is
a
variation.
let's
assume
whatever
the
test
is,
you
need
a
tie-breaker.
i'm
the
judge.
i
cannot
decide.
you
know,
there's
this
and
there's
that...
i'm
on
the
fence.
why
is
it
an
impermissible
tie-breaker
to
give
dispositive
weight
to
the
fact
that
the
voyage...
that
the
ship
was
on
a
voyage,
that
he
was
employed,
that
he
was
not
a
passenger,
or
a
stowaway,
and
the
injury
resulted
from
an
accepted
hazard
of
sea
voyages?
why
is
that
an
impermissible
tie-breaker
on
any
test?
justice
david
h.
souter
justice
kennedy
wasn't
suggesting
that,
and
at
this
point
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i'm
just
saying,
whatever
the
test
is,
we
come
out
at
a
point
of
equipoise.
why
is
that
factor,
or
that
congeries
of
factors,
not
a
reasonable
and
sufficient
basis
to
break
the
tie?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
go
back
to
one
answer,
or
one
question
you
answered
a
moment
ago?
you're
not
making
the
argument
that
place
of
injury
combined
with
exposure
to
hazards
at
sea
is,
i
think
the
word
was
compelling,
you're
saying
that
it
may,
indeed,
break
the
tie.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
perfectly
consistent
with
answering
that
if
a
person
is
a
seaman,
and
has
the
same
eye
injury
on
land,
he
will
still
be
treated
as
a
seaman
for
purposes
of
the
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
possible
to
read
the
second
circuit
test
and
to
answer
justice
breyer's
question
in
some
such
way
as
this:
we
will
start
with
agreement
that
once
a
person
has
attained
seaman
status,
he
doesn't
lose
that
status
by
going
ashore
for
a
month
or
something
of
that
sort,
he
doesn't
become
a
nonseaman
when
he
crosses
the
gangplank,
and
we
will
assume
that
when
someone
does
not
have
seaman
status,
mere
presence
fora
short
time,
perhaps
even
as
an
employee
on
the
ship,
may
not
be
enough.
but
there
are
some
cases,
and
perhaps
this
is
one,
in
which,
by...
in
which
the
previously
nonseaman
goes
on
a
voyage
and
performs
duties
which
in
fact
indicate
a
change
in
his
job,
and
when
that
happens,
as
it
might
be
if
the
welder
went
to
sea
and
while
they
were
at
sea
somebody
said,
my
god,
there's
a
leak
in
the
hull,
can
you
weld
it
shut,
and
he
goes
down,
of
course
he's
contributing
to
the
mission
of
the
ship,
et
cetera.
in
that
case,
he
is
simply
performing
a
different
kind
of
job
for
his
employer
from
what
he
does
when
he
sits
in
drydock
and
so
on,
and
this
may
be
one
of
those
cases,
and
the
second
circuit's
test
is
consistent
with
applying...
may
consistently
be
applied
to
find
seaman
status,
because
once
the
job
has
changed,
he
regularly
is
performing
those
duties.
is
that
perhaps
a
way
to
reconcile--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
answer
what
is
bothering
all
of
us?
