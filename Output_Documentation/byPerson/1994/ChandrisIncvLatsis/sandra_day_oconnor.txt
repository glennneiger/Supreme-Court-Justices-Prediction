justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
i
think
what
it
didn't
do
was
answer
the
question
whether
the
employee's
contribution
has
to
be
simply
substantial,
or
a
more
permanent
one,
in
effect,
with
regard
to
his
maritime
employment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
it
was,
and
the
fifth
circuit
seems
to
have
a
more
restrictive
test,
pointing,
perhaps,
to
permanent
employment
in
that
capacity,
and
the
second
circuit
spoke
in
terms
of
a
substantial
contribution
in
terms
of
duration
or
nature.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
test
do
you
say
this
court
must
adopt?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
say
are
the
fatal
flaws
with
the
second
circuit's
articulation
of
the
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
mr.
latsis
could
have
been
covered
under
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
act
for
these
injuries?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did...
to
your
knowledge,
does
the
record
disclose
whether
he
ever
made
an
application
under
that
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
there
is
no
textual--
--well,
there
is
no
definition,
is
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
been
left
to
this
court
to
define,
and
i
guess
under
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
act
we've
extended
coverage
to
people
who
make
short
trips
all
the
time.
they're
in
and
out
of
the
harbor,
and
they're
making
very
short
trips,
and
to
use
a
voyage
test
might
get
us
into
some
difficulty,
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
asking--
--but
if
you're
a
seaman,
and
the
injury
occurs
on
land,
you
are
still
covered
under
the
jones
act
as
a
seaman,
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
it
wouldn't--
--isn't
that
what
the
fifth
circuit
does?
you
look
at
the
job
as
a
whole,
and
look
to
see
whether
there
is
a
permanent
employment
as
a
seaman
on
a
vessel?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
right?
i
mean,
is
that
more
the
focus
of
the
fifth
circuit
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
now,
the
second
circuit
does
not
require
a
permanent
connection.
it
says,
there
can
be
some
in-and-out
coverage
to
the
extent
that
the
employment,
or
the
contribution
of
the
employee
was
substantial
in
terms
of
its
duration
and
nature,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
neither
the
second
circuit
nor
the
fifth
circuit
use
the
so-called
voyage
test,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we're
not
reviewing
a
judgment
that
used
that
test.
that
would
be
going
off
in
another
direction,
would
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
wait
a
minute.
i
thought
that
the
second
circuit
in
the
very
case
we're
looking
at
here
said
that
one
of
the
requirements
of
their
test
was
that
the
course
of
the
plaintiff's
employment
regularly
exposed
the
plaintiff
to
the
hazards
of
the
sea.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
their
express
test,
and
that's
what
i
hear
you
saying
the
test
ought
to
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
did
they
articulate
the
right
test?
let's
go
that
far.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
know,
it's
very
hard
to
pin
you
down,
because
you've
just
wavered
this
way
and
that
throughout
this
argument,
but
the
second
circuit
had
several
requirements
in
its
test,
and
one
of
them
was
that
the
plaintiff's
contribution
was
substantial
in
terms
of
its
duration
or
nature.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
take
issue
with
that,
is
that
where
you
differ?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
part
of
the
problem
that
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
act
is
set
up
as
a
sort
of
a
scheduled
workman's
compensation
type
program,
and
you
calculate
the
benefits
and
the
employer's
liability
based
on
predictable
factors
of
the
employment,
whereas
the
jones
act
is
just
an
open-ended
damages
cause
of
action,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
what
the
courts
have
done,
basically,
is
not
to
adopt
this
voyage
test
so
that
they
keep
a
stable
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
act
compensation
scheme
in
place,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you've
got
problems,
because
the
two
systems
are
not
the
same,
and
so
at
the
margins
you
run
into
some
difficulties.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
if
he
were
a
seaman,
if
latsis
is
in
fact,
or
was
in
fact
at
the
time
a
seaman
for
purposes
of
the
jones
act,
and
if
his
retina
had
detached
while
he
was
sitting
in
his
office
on
the
dock,
he
would
have
been
covered,
wouldn't
he,
as
a
seaman
under
the
jones
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
same
doctor,
said
don't...
you
know,
don't
worry
right
now.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
if
he's
not
a
seaman,
would
he
be
covered
under
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
but
as
far
as
you
know
he
would
be.
if
he
isn't
a
seaman,
then
you
think--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--which
he
doesn't?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
a
scheme
that's
set
up
for
employee
option,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we're
clear
about
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he
either
is,
or
he
isn't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
second
circuit
test
would
not
cover
the
welder
who
was
asked
to
go
to
hamburg,
because
it
clearly
said,
you
also
have
to
find
that
in
the
course
of
the
plaintiff's
employment,
the
plaintiff
is
regularly
exposed
to
the
hazards
of
the
sea.
the
second
circuit
wouldn't
cover
the
welder.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
i
thought
that
this
case
had
gone
back
to
be...
have
the
jury
consider
this
under
the
second
circuit's
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
their
plan.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
we're
reviewing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
like
the
second
circuit
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
didn't
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
as
it
now
stands
it
will
go
back
under
that
test,
which
certainly
wouldn't
cover
the
welder
who's
sent
to
hamburg,
would
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the--
--and
isn't
perhaps
a
way
to...
i'm
sorry.
the
second
circuit
clearly
had
an
additional
requirement,
in
addition
to,
that
it
be
substantial
contribution.
the
second
circuit
also
said
that
the
plaintiff's
employment
had
to
regularly
expose
the
plaintiff
to
the
hazards
of
the
sea.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
second
circuit
had
an
additional
requirement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
welder
on
a
one-time
trip
would
not
be
covered
under
that
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
except
that
the
fifth
circuit
would
say
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
you
look
at
the
permanent
job
assignment--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
if
the
permanent
assignment
is
to
be
in
an
office
and
supervise
the
engineering
on
the
whole
fleet
of
ships,
even
though
occasionally
having
to
make
a
trip
at
sea
in
doing
that,
the
permanent
assignment
is
not
that
of
a
seaman.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
you
would
have
a
difference
in
the
circuits
on
that.
