are
engineers
treated
as
longshoremen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
even
a
land-based
engineer;
would
a
land-based
engineer
be
a
longshoreman?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
there
are
a
category
of
personnel
who
are
neither
seamen
nor
longshoremen
who
might
go
to
sea
once
in
a
while?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
wouldn't
be
employed
by
the
vessel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
my
hypo
did.
i
thought
justice
souter's
hypo
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
be
employed
by
the
vessel,
and
be...
and
further,
be
at
sea
when
you
get
hurt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
those
are
all
clearly
examples
of
people
who
would
not
be
longshoremen,
i
assume.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
do
have
a
category
of
people
who
are
neither
longshoremen
or
seamen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rosenberg--
--how
would
he
make
his
choice?
i
mean,
you
never
finished
your
sentence.
if
he
had
a
choice,
what
would
he
choose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
employee.
i
thought
you
were
talking
about--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
choice
is
not
perfectly
clear
if
it's
an
employee,
because
one
side
you
get
absolute
liability,
and
on
the
other
hand
you
have
to
prove
negligence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
mr.--
--mr.
rosenberg,
can
i
ask
you...
i
should
know
this,
and
i've
just
forgotten
it.
isn't
there
both
a
situs
test
and
a
status
test
under
the
longshoreman's
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
in
the
situs
test,
would
he
have
met
the
situs
test
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
situs
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
he
be
a
longshoreman
if
he
was
1,000
miles
out
to
sea?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
i
mean,
it
wouldn't
meet
the
situs
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
isn't
it
true
that
a
lot
of
people
who
are
at
sea...
this
is
following
up
on
justice
souter's
approach...
would
not
meet
the
situs
test
under
the
longshoreman's
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
reveal
my
stupidity
once
more,
but
you
know,
we've
talked
about
this
welder
going
to
sea,
just
one
example.
i
thought
he
would
be
covered
under
the
second
circuit
test,
because
i
thought
they
left
the
duration
as
one
way
of
proving
substantiality,
and
nature
the
other
way,
and
if
the
nature
of
his
work
during
the
voyage
was
what
every
seaman
does...
maybe
they
just
send
this
welder
out...
i
thought
that
would
be
covered
under
the
second
circuit
test,
but
you've
conceded
it
would
not
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
one
long
voyage
from,
you
know,
here
to
tokyo...
or
yokosuka,
i
guess.
