mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
common
and
troublesome
question
of
who
is
a
seaman
under
the
jones
act.
unfortunately,
the
jones
act
does
not
define
the
statutory
term,
seaman,
so
that
task
is
left
to
the
courts.
this
court
has
struggled
with
that
issue
over
the
years,
as
have
the
circuit
and
district
courts.
traditionally,
the
test
that
has
been
used,
even
if
it
has
more
than
two
parts,
breaks
the
seaman
test
down
into
the
examination
of
the
connection
of
the
employee
to
his
employer,
or
the
vessel
and
then,
secondly,
the
employee's
contribution
to
the
vessel
itself.
in
wilander,
this
court
addressed
the
second
part
of
that
test,
and
answered
the
question
of
whether
a
seaman
must
contribute
to
the
navigation
of
the
vessel
and,
of
course,
the
holding
was
that
that
is
not
necessary.
the
seaman
must
merely
contribute
to
the
function
or
contribute
to
the
mission
of
the
vessel.
the
issue
today
addresses
the
first
question,
and
that
is,
what
is
the
employment-related
connection
to
the
vessel
that
is
necessary?
wilander,
although
it
addressed
the
navigation
issue,
did
make
statements
and
give
clues
as
to
what
employment-related
connection
is
necessary.
one
important--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--that
issue
was
certainly
left
open.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
and
i
think
that
that
focuses
us
squarely
on
the
issue
today.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
well,
in
analyzing,
justice
o'connor,
those
two
tests,
i
believe
that
although
there
were
some
good
intentions
in
the
latsis
test,
there
are
two
fatal
flaws
in
that
test,
and
therefore
i
advocate
the
fifth
circuit
test
which
has
withstood
many,
many
years
of
tests
under
fire,
under
battle.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
the
latsis
test...
the
problem
with
the
latsis
test
is
that
we
do
know
from
wilander
that
longshoreman
and
jones
act
seamen
are
mutually
exclusive.
we
also--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--yes.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
the
record
does
not
disclose
whether
mr.
latsis
made
an
application.
going
outside
the
record,
if
may,
mr.
justice,
there
is
no
indication
that
he
has
done
so.
i
have,
in
anticipation
of
that
question,
tried
to
determine
without
unduly
getting
off
the
track
to
determine
whether
he
still
has
that
remedy,
and
my
preliminary
research
is
that
under
33
u.s.
13(g),
i
believe
it
is,
there
is
a
tolling
section
that
would
allow
him
to
proceed
that
remedy
if
he's
unsuccessful
as
this
case
runs
through
the
courts.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
traditional
crew
members
who
hold
the
position
of
engineers
are
not
treated
as
longshoremen.
they
are
permanently
assigned
to
a
vessel,
and
therefore,
under
any
tests--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--a
land-based
engineer
who
was
performing
ship
repairs
would
be
a
longshoreman
under
the
fifth
circuit
robinson
test,
and
in
my
view
the
correct
test,
because
he's
going
to
split
time
between
shore
and
sea,
and
depending
on
how
much
time
he
spends
at
sea
and
how
much
time
at
shore,
he
could
be
a
longshoreman.
most
of
those
questions,
of
course,
are
for
the
jury
to
decide,
and
this
court
has
been
unequivocal
also
in
that
statement,
that
seaman
status,
unless
it's
so
clear--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--there
is
that
category,
and
in
that
case
they
are
entitled
to
traditional
negligence
remedies,
but
here,
because
he
is
performing
ship
repair,
or
species
of
ship
repair,
i
believe
he
is
covered
by
the
longshore
act.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
there--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--to
my
knowledge
there
are
no
supreme
court
cases
that
specifically
define
what
a
repair
is
for
the
purposes
of
the
longshore
act
or
the
jones
act.
however,
there
are
some
circuit
cases,
and
my
interpretation
of
those
cases
is
that
it's
a
fairly
common
sense
definition,
and
that
if
a
person
is
utilizing
his
talents
to
replace
communication
equipment,
or
shore
up
communication
equipment,
or
to
fix
engine
problems
or
consult
on
engine
problems,
that
that
person
then
would
be
doing
repairs.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
he...
his
residence
was
in
new
york,
but
he
spent
most
of
his
living
time
in
miami,
florida,
in
the
company
offices
and
in
a
condominium
that
had
been
rented
for
his
purpose
in
miami.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
under
that
circumstance,
i
think
to
correct
myself,
he
would
not
be
a
longshoreman,
because
to
be
a
longshoreman
you
need
to
satisfy
the
situs
and
the
status
test,
and
although
he
would
satisfy
the
status
test,
he
would
not
satisfy
the
situs
test,
so
i
stand
corrected
on
that
answer.
that--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--justice
souter,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
you're
reviewing
the
elements
of
the
voyage
test,
which
would
cover
the
situation
that
you've
described,
and
i
believe
not
only
would
you
create
difficulties,
i
think
you
would
open
the
floodgates
to
more
and
more
litigation
over
this
issue,
and
more
importantly,
i
think--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--i
think
both
would
occur.
more
importantly,
i
believe
that
the
congress'
intent
under
the
longshore
act
would
be
vitiated
by
that
test.
to
give
you
an
example--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--that
is
correct,
and--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--that's
not
what
the
second
circuit
does.
that
is
the
correct
law
that
you're
describing.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
the
two
flaws
that
the
second
circuit...
the
latsis
test
suffers
from
are
not
the
same
as
the
voyage
test
that
was
introduced
in
the
respondent's
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
more
liberal,
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
the
reason
why
the
voyage
test
is
wrong
is,
it
has
absolutely
no
resolving
power,
and
the
examples
of
who
would
qualify
under
that
test,
you
can
go
on
and
on
and
on,
and
in
fact
the
justice
of
this
court--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--well,
the
voyage
test
does
not
comply
with
the
requirements
that
were
set
down
in
wilander,
and
the
voyage
test
certainly
would
not
be
restricted
to
the
master
or
members
of
the
crew.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
i'm
not
sure
i--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--the
act
unfortunately
only
has
the
word
seaman--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
there
is
no--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--for
example,
the
justices
of
this
court
could
be
seamen
under
the
voyage
test.
if
the
aba
or
another
bar
group
chartered
a
vessel
and
they
operated
the
vessel,
and
there
was
a
seminar
on
board,
and
one
or
more
of
the
court
was
invited
to
be
a
speaker
on
that
cruise,
that
voyage,
and
there
was
an
injury
to
one
of
the
justices,
the
simplistic
elements
of
the
voyage
test
would
be
met,
because
the
justice
would
be
contributing
to
the
mission
of
the
vessel...
i.e.,
giving
an
educational
seminar,
like
an
entertainer
on
a
cruise
ship,
you
would
be
hurt
during
the
voyage,
and
it
would
be
for
the
duration
of
the
voyage.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
but
the
voyage
test
does
not
require
employment.
that's
another
reason--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--then
that
would--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--if
you
impose
a
further
duty
that
was
not
mentioned
in
the
respondent's
brief
on
the
merits,
that
there
be
an
employment
relationship
between
the
owner
of
the
vessel
and
that
employee,
that
would
exclude
the
example
of
the
justices
of
this
court,
but
it
would
not
exclude
the
example
of
the
general
counsel
of
the
cruise
line,
the
ceo
of
a
cruise
line,
the
in-house
marketing
person
from
the
cruise
line,
all
who
would
have
employment
relationships
with
the
vessel
owner,
and
then
you've
satisfied
that
element,
and
then
you
go
right
back
to
the
point
of,
they're
on
a
voyage
for
the
duration
of
the
voyage--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
there
certainly
are.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
in
the
latsis
case
itself,
the
longshore
act
in
my
view
does
cover
the
situation,
because
he
was
a
ship
repairman.
the
examples
i
gave
of
the
general
counsel,
the
ceo,
and
an
in-house
marketing
person,
they
do
not
fall
within
the
category
of
the
longshore
act.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
absolutely
correct,
and
that
is
because
the
seaman
status
is
not
established
at
the
exact
time
of
the
accident,
or...
and
what
you're
doing
immediately
before
the
accident.
in
seaman's
cases,
this
court
over
and
over
has
decided
that
it
doesn't
want
seamen
to
walk
in
and
out
of
coverage,
so
you
looked
to
the
overall
employment
relationship,
decided
what
status
the
person
was,
and
whether
they
were
on
shore
or
on
a
ship,
they're
entitled
to
seamen's
remedies.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
that
is
certainly
a
complicating
factor,
and
it
makes
it
more
difficult
for
us
just
to
exclude
that
person.
i've
tried
to
point
out
examples
of
how
using
just
a
voyage
test
creates
problems.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
and
i
agree
with
your
summary.
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question.
it
does
not
fit
the...
or,
the
status
tests
that
i
advocate.
it
does
have
a
certain
intuitive,
simplistic
appeal
that
it
is
an
easy
test
to
apply,
and
from
that
perspective,
i
thought
that
it
is
complicating,
but
it's
not--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--the
perils
of
the
sea
is
certainly
one
of
the
policy
considerations
in
protecting
seamen.
the
problem
comes
in
when
you
use
that
as
your
sole
basis
for
fashioning
a
seaman
test.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
it
is
one
of
the
factors
involved,
but,
for
example,
as
we
discussed
earlier,
seamen
who
are
on
shore
are
no
longer
subjected
to
the
perils
of
the
sea,
and--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--that
is
correct.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
that
is
my
position,
and
i
probably
confused
it
by,
again,
conceding
that
there
are
some
advocates
who
want
to
just
look
to
the
place
of
the
injury
to
determine
whether
someone
is
a
seaman.
that
is
contrary,
i
believe,
to
wilander,
contrary
to
the
fifth
circuit
test--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--that
is
correct.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
mr.
chief
justice,
he
can,
and
that's
the
series
of
supreme
court
cases
that
hold
that
you're
not
going
to
let
a
seaman
walk
in
and
out
of
coverage
solely
because
of
the
fortuity
of
where
the
injury
occurs.
his
status
is
established
by
looking
at
his
entire
employment
with
that
vessel,
or
that
employer,
and
when
he
comes
ashore
and
is
injured,
i
think
there's
cases
dealing
with
dance
halls
and
all...
you
know,
all
kind
of
activities
that
seamen
engage
in.
they
all
are
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure,
and
seamen's
remedies,
including
the
jones
act.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
i
agree
with
your
position,
and
it
is
a
line-drawing
problem
we
have
here
today.
where
do
you
draw
the
lines?
i
do
not
agree
that
whether
they're
on
a
voyage
should
be
the
end-all
and
be-all
of
the
tests,
but
i
do
advocate
using
that
at
the
very
end--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--i
argue
that
that's
how
the
tie
should
be
broken,
and
that
the
perils
of
the
sea
that
occur
at
sea
or
on
vessels
that
are
in
movement,
that
that
should
be
added
to
the
fifth
circuit
test
to
provide
the
proper
test
for
this
court.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
my
position
is
that
you
cannot
use
perils
of
the
sea
as
the
sole
basis
for
your
test.
you
have
to
start
with
wilander,
and
use
an
employment-related
connection
to
a
vessel.
the
only
place
that
the
perils
of
the
sea
comes
into
play
is,
when
you're
trying
to
draw
the
fine
line
at
the
very
end
of
the
test,
i
think
it's
relevant
to
distinguish
between
longshoremen
and
seamen.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
the
test
that
we've
advocated
here
would
allow
the
employer
or
the
court
to
make
that
determination--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--the
permanent
connection--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--the
fifth
circuit
test,
the
first
prong,
or...
is
the
permanent
connection.
there
is--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--that
is
correct.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
no
port
that
i
know
of
has
used
that
test.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
that
is
correct.
this
case
involves
a
dispute
between
the
robinson-barrett
test
and
the
latsis
test,
and
the
problem
with
the
latsis
test
is
that
when
it
uses
the
terms,
duration
or
nature,
it
allows
a
person
who
spends,
in
the
jury's
eyes,
90
percent
of
their
time
on
shore,
and
who
have
some
contact
with
vessels,
to
be
seamen,
and
that
is
contrary
to
the
fifth
circuit
test,
and
i
believe
to
the
statements
in
wilander.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
i
think
the--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--the
difficulty
is,
and
the
reason
that
that
is
a
problem,
is
because,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
the
court
has
to
give
the
law,
and
the
jury
has
to
make
the
decision,
and
what
i'm
trying
to
explain
is
that
there
are
situations
that
superficially
fall
under
the
robinson-barrett
test,
and
makes
a
longshoreman
into
a
seaman,
and
that
is
contrary
to
congress'
intent
as
to
what
they
want
to
occur.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
explain
in
the
fourth
part
of
my
brief
on
the
merits
is
that,
in
order
to
fortify
the
fifth
circuit
test,
to
shore
it
up
so
that
it
is
more
precise,
so
that
it
does
help
a
jury
reach
a
realistic
and
honest
appraisal
of
the
seaman's
status
and
also
help
an
employer
know
what
his
employees
are,
that
conceptually
it
is
fair
to
shore
that
up
by
adding
in
that
you
need
either
a
permanent
connection,
or
a
substantial
connection,
as
long
as
the
substantial
prong
is
fortified
by
exposure,
the
perils
at
sea,
not
at
the
dock,
or
to
the
dangers
of
vessels
while
they're
underway
at
sea.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
correct.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
the
difference
between
the
tests
are
that
the
perils
of
the
sea
is
mentioned
in
the
latsis
test,
but
when
they
use
the
term,
regularly
exposed
to
the
perils
of
the
sea,
they
did
not
address
or
use
the
word
regularly,
so
under
the
latsis
test--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--all
a
person
has
to
be
is
exposed
at
the
time
of
his
injury,
he's
a
seaman--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
but
they
didn't
apply
the
"regularly"
portion,
because
regularly--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--the
perils
of
the
sea
prong
is
correct.
that
does
conform
with
what
i
believe
the
rule
should
be.
the
problem
with
the
latsis
test
is
that
they
use
that
alternative,
nature
or
duration,
and
they
allow
the
shore-based
person
to
gain
sea-time,
if
you
will,
while
he's
endeavoring
to
provide
services
to
a
ship
while
he's
sitting
in
his
office,
and
it's
that
activity
which
can
be
up
to
90
percent,
according
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
that
i
believe
violates
congress'
intent
under
the
longshore
act,
and
therefore,
pursuant
to
wilander,
violates
the
jones
act.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
correct.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
that
is
the
main
problem.
that
is
a
problem
with
the
test
itself,
because
it
allows
shore-based
employees,
contrary
to
wilander,
to
be
seamen.
i
also
take
exception
with
the
fact
that
they
articulate,
regularly
exposed
to
the
perils
of
the
sea,
but
they
never
used
it
and
never
applied
it
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
because
if
a
person
who
is
only
out
there
10
percent
of
the
time
is
regularly
exposed
to
the
perils
of
the
sea,
then
that
doesn't
have
any
meaning
that
will
help
with
a
test
that
will
resolve
these
cases.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
yes.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
that
would
be
tantamount
to
the
voyage
test,
and
i
believe
there
are
problems
with
covering
an
employee
just
because
he
goes
on
one
voyage.
you
have
to
look
to
his
entire
employment-related
connection
to
the
vessel.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
if
he
totally
changes
his
job
status--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--and
is
permanently
assigned
to
the
vessel,
he
changes
from
a
longshoreman
into
a
seaman.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
because
this
court
and
congress
have
shown
a
disinclination
to
allow
people
to
wander
in
and
out
of
coverage.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
that
is
correct,
and
that's
the
benefit
of
this
system.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
