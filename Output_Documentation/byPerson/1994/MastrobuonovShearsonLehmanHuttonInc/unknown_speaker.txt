unknown
speaker
mr.
harte,
does
the
ultimate
resolution
of
this
case
depend
upon
what
it
is
the
parties
contracted
to
do
with
regard
to
this
matter?
unknown
speaker
and
in
that
regard,
help
me
out
a
little
bit.
it
isn't
clear
to
me
that
the
arbitrator
ever
interpreted
the
parties'
agreement.
there
was
language
that
indicated
that
as
a
matter
of
equity,
or
justice,
or
something,
the
arbitrator
thought
that
punitives
should
be
awarded,
but
it
was
not
expressly
stated
that
the
arbitrator
was
interpreting
the
parties'
agreement
as
permitting
the
award
of
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wasn't
asking
you
about
preemption.
i
was
asking
about
what
the
parties--
unknown
speaker
--provided
in
their
agreement
as
a
matter
of
contract
interpretation.
unknown
speaker
did
they
or
did
they
not
contemplate
the
award
of
punitive
damages
as
a
possibility?
unknown
speaker
but
they
also
said
they
agreed
to
be
bound
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york.
unknown
speaker
and
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
do
not
allow
arbitrators
to
award
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
well,
but--
unknown
speaker
--just
a
minute.
unknown
speaker
are
you
questioning
my
statement
that
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
says
that
arbitrators
cannot
award
punitive
damages?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
rephrase
it
to
say
you
can
get
punitive
damages
in
a
nonarbitrable
forum,
i.e.,
a
judicial
forum?
unknown
speaker
they've
agreed
to
be
bound
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
says
arbitrators
can't
give
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
did
the
contract
also
provide
that
the
nasd
rules
apply--
unknown
speaker
--to
any
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
now,
under
the
nasd
rules,
is
it
clear
that
punitives
can
be
awarded,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so
there
may
be
a
conflict
in
the
terms
of
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
so
it
may
become
important
to
know
what
the
parties
intended.
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct,
mr.
harte,
that
the
nasd
rules
do
not
require
punitives
to
be
awarded,
nor
do
they
preclude
it?
the
nasd
rules
are
simply
agnostic
on
the
question,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
so
what
we
have
is
a
juxtaposition
of
nasd
rules
which
do
not
answer
the
question,
they
leave
the
question
open,
and
a
new
york
common
law
rule
which
does
answer
the
question
to
the
effect
that
an
arbitrator
may
not,
in
fact,
award
punitive
damages.
is
there
any
conflict
there
that
needs
to
be
resolved?
unknown
speaker
but
not
required.
in
other
words,
it's
left
open.
unknown
speaker
so
you're--
unknown
speaker
--so
you're
saying
on
the
point
in
question
the
nasd
rules
really
are
not
agnostic.
they
say
you
can
award
them,
new
york
law
says
you
can't.
clear
conflict,
that's
your
position.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
different
kind
of
question.
under
the
faa,
there
may
be
a
judicial
appeal
on
the
question
of
whether
an
arbitrator
has
exceeded
his
authority
as
an
arbitrator.
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
question
here,
whether
an
arbitrator
may
or
may
not
award
punitive
damages,
an
issue
properly
considered
as
one
of
the
arbitrator's
authority?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
that's--
unknown
speaker
--excuse
me.
no,
that's
not
my
question.
the
question
is,
is
the
issue
of
whether
they
may
award
punitive
damages
an
issue
of
their
authority,
which
is
subject
to
judicial
appeal?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
an
issue
of
the
arbitrator's
authority?
one
side
says,
you
may
award
punitive
damages
under
our
contract.
the
other
side
says,
you
may
not.
isn't
that
an
issue
of
the
arbitrator's
authority?
all
i
want
to
know
is
whether
that
is
subject
to
a
judicial
appeal,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
an
issue
of
the
arbitrator's
authority.
unknown
speaker
so
that
there
can
never
be
an
appeal
to
the
courts
on
that
issue,
under
the
faa.
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
i
think
what
you're
telling
me
is
the
answer
to
the
question
if
there
is
an
appeal
on
that
subject.
i
simply
want
to
know,
at
this
stage
of
the
game,
is
the
question
of
the
arbitrator's
authority
to
award
punitive
damages
an
issue
which
is
properly
subject
to
a--
unknown
speaker
--judicial
appeal
under
the
faa?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
then?
it's
along
the
same
line
of
the
questions
the
chief
justice
was
asking
about,
the
status
of
the
laws
of
new
york.
suppose
you
have
two
people
in
new
york...
it's
a
hypothetical
case,
two
people
in
new
york.
they
sign
an
agreement
where
they
say,
we
simply
agree
to
arbitrate.
unknown
speaker
it
happens
that
their
transaction
occurs
in
new
york,
and
the
arbitrator
applies
new
york
law.
do
you
take
the
position
that
in
that
case
the
faa
displaces
the
garrity
rule?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
your
position,
then,
is
that
the
faa
preempts
the
garrity
rule.
unknown
speaker
and
so
i
take
it
it's
your
further
position,
or
am
i
correct
about
this,
that
when
the
parties
incorporate
new
york
law
in
an
agreement
where
they
expressly
refer
to
new
york
law--
unknown
speaker
--they
incorporate
new
york
law
subject
to
federal
rules
of
preemption?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you--
unknown
speaker
--how
do
you
reconcile
your
position
with
our
decision
in
the
volt
case
several
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
mr.
harte,
may
i...
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
interpretation
of
this
contract
clause,
but
i
thought
you
were
presenting
the
simple
case
that
when
we
have
a
choice
of
law
clause,
new
york
law...
new
york
law
permits
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
and
then
we
move
on
to
the
choice
of
forum
clause,
which
is
we're
choosing
arbitration
under
the
nsad
rules,
which
are
neutral,
so
you
choose
new
york
substantive
law
which
permits
punitive
damages,
you've
chosen
arbitration,
the
arbitration
forum,
which
is
governed
by
in
this
case
nasd
rules,
not
california
rules,
as
in
the
other
case,
and
that's...
it's
as
simple
as
that,
is
your
contract
interpretation,
i
thought,
but
what
i'm
hearing
is
a
little
more
complicated.
unknown
speaker
because
if
all
you
had--
unknown
speaker
--if
all
you
had
in
this
contract
was
a
choice
of
law
clause,
then
new
york
law
permits
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
and...
but
that
would
say
nothing
about
the
forum.
then,
going
over
to
the
forum,
your
position
is,
on
the
forum
the
nsad
rules
control.
there's
no
inconsistency.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
harte.
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
so
in
your
view
this
is
just
strictly
a
question
of
contract
interpretation.
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
know
what
those
views
are,
because
the
arbitrator
never
said,
this
is
what
the
parties
agreed,
and
that's
what
i'm
applying.
unknown
speaker
but
in
those
cases,
mr.
stewart,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
the
law
of
the
shop
and
that
sort
of
thing,
which
is
really
peculiar
to
labor
arbitration,
and
i
don't
think
you
have
any
factors
like
that
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
have--
unknown
speaker
--don't
you
have
something
more
here,
though?
the
arbitrator
in
effect
said
in
so
many
words,
i'm
not
really
following
the
contract
as
written,
i'm
following
its
spirit.
i'm
doing
justice
here.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
arbitrator
in
effect
say,
i'm
remaking
it
my
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
isn't
going
to
be
quite
that
dumb,
but
he
came
close
to
that,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
a
reviewing
court
isn't
sure,
and
thinks
maybe
the
arbitrator
was
just
relying
on
some
spirit
or
sense
of
justice,
and
not
relying
on
the
contract
terms
at
all,
what
is
the
reviewing
court
to
do--
unknown
speaker
--to
send
it
back
to
the
arbitrator?
i
mean,
what's
the
role
of
the
reviewing
court,
and
is
your
office
taking
a
position
in
this
first
options
case
that's
going
to
be
argued
that
seems
to
sort
of
raise
this
question?
unknown
speaker
but
this
one
did
give
an
explanation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
may
i
just
ask,
going
back
before
the
first
options
question,
wasn't
that
spirit
of
the
law
sentence
followed
up
in
that
same
brief
by
what
i
thought
was
the
plaintiff's
interpretation...
the
petitioner's
interpretation
of
the
contract,
that
is,
the
choice
of
law
clause
governed
only
new
york
substantive
law--
unknown
speaker
--i.e.,
punitive
damages
are
available,
and
arbitration
was
governed
by
the
nsad
rules?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
polizzotto.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
i
put
my
understanding
of
the
argument
before
you
and
ask
you
to
comment
on
it?
i
suppose
one
could
interpret
the
language,
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york,
in
one
of
two
ways,
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
did
so
that
it
picks
up
the
garrity
rule,
or
one
can
read
it
to
say,
apply
the
laws
that
a
new
york
court
would
apply
in
the
same
controversy,
and
they
obviously
took
the
latter
view.
now,
supposing
under
your
view
of
the
contract
new
york
law,
instead
of
providing
punitive
damages
shall
not
be
awarded,
provided
that
no
damages
shall
be
awarded,
and
the
arbitrator
shall
only
have
authority
to
enter
the
equivalent
of
a
declaratory
judgment
construing
the
terms
of
the
contract.
would
that
foreclose
the
award
of
damages?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
a
reasonable
construction
of
this
contract
to
say
it's
got
a
choice
of
law
clause...
ordinarily
that
means
substantive
law,
punitive
damages
okay
under
new
york
law...
it's
got
a
choice
of
forum
clause,
that
forum
is
arbitration
governed
by
the
nsad
rules,
you
read
them
compatibly
to
say,
new
york
law
says
substantive
damages,
punitive
damages
are
okay,
nsad
procedural
law
says
it's
neutral,
and
so
that's
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
contract?
if
the
contract
is
ambiguous,
you
drew
it.
it
should
be
construed
against
you.
unknown
speaker
so
the
parties
could
not
have
said,
we
want
new
york
substantive
law,
and
not
new
york
arbitration
law.
we
want
new
york
substantive
law
to
govern,
and
then
we
want
the
nsad
rules
to
govern
arbitration.
suppose
they
had...
they
certainly
could
have
done
that.
there's
nothing
obligatory
about
new
york
law.
this
is
for
the
parties
to
dispose
of,
right?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
question
of
what
the
parties
mean,
right?
unknown
speaker
they
can
write
their
own
law
into
the
contract.
so
they
say,
as
a
shorthand,
instead
of
writing
out
all
the
terms
and
conditions,
we
pick
new
york.
it's
got
good
substantive
law,
good
contract
law.
so
we
pick
new
york
law
to
govern
the
terms
and
conditions,
and
we
pick
the
nsad
arbitration
rules.
unknown
speaker
which
means
they're
allowed.
which
means...
which
means
that
so
far
as
the
nasd
rules
are
concerned,
the
arbitrator
can
award
them.
unknown
speaker
no,
but--
--the
question
is
whether
it
does
sweep
in...
i
mean,
you
have
admitted,
and
i
think
as
you
must,
that
the
parties
could
draw
their
own
bargain
here,
and
the
question
is,
what
bargain
did
they
draw,
and
why
isn't
it
a
logical
reading
to
say
that
they
picked
up
only
new
york
substantive
law?
unknown
speaker
if
you
had
nothing
but
that
first
sentence,
you'd
go
into
a
court,
because
you
have
no
arbitration,
the
agreement
shall
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york.
bring
that
case
in
new
york,
you
get
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
are
you
reading
from
somewhere
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
now,
where
are
you
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
okay,
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't...
are
you
sure
you're
on
page
29?
unknown
speaker
and
then
tell
us
again
where
you're
reading
from.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
that's
what
i
didn't
get.
i
thought
you
were
reading
verbatim.
unknown
speaker
mr.
polizzotto,
isn't
the
choice
open
to
you
something
like
this.
if
you
read
the
contract
the
way
justice
ginsburg
was
suggesting,
there's
no
conflict
and
there's
no
ambiguity
as
between
the
choice
of
law
provision
and
the
choice
of
forum
provision.
if
you
read
the
contract
the
way
you
were
suggesting,
there
is
an
ambiguity,
but
that
ambiguity
would
normally
be
resolvable
against
you
as
the
party
who
drew
the
contract,
so
either
way,
you
lose,
and
either
way
the
arbitrator's
award
should
be
upheld.
unknown
speaker
well,
have
each...
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
no,
go
on.
well,
have
each
of
the
instances
that
you
allude
to
been
instances
in
which
there
was
a
potential
conflict
situation
as
between
contractual
provisions
so
that
the
reading
in
question
either
avoids
the
conflict,
as
in
justice
ginsburg's
suggestion,
or
reads
the
other
way
to
provide
an
ambiguity
in
which,
under
the
rule
of
construing
the
contract
against
the
maker,
you
would
lose.
unknown
speaker
has
that
been
the
case
in
all
of
those
instances
that
you
allude
to?
unknown
speaker
mr.
polizzotto,
do
you
think
that
th
new
york
law
at
issue
here
has
any
existence
except
as
something
to
be
referred
to
by
private
parties?
that
is
to
say,
if
it
were
not
adopted
voluntarily
by
the
parties
would
this
new
york
rule
be
enforceable
under
our
current
interpretation
of
the
faa?
unknown
speaker
so
in--
unknown
speaker
--so
instead
of
declining
to
honor
arbitral
awards,
which
would
violate
the
faa
as
we've
interpreted
it,
the
states
could
instead
render
arbitral
awards
worthless
by
piece-by-piece
saying
you
can't
give
punitive
damages,
maybe
you
can't
give
expectation
damages,
maybe
you
can
give
nothing
but
a
declaratory
judgment.
could
they
do
that,
and
that
would...
wouldn't
that
violate
the
faa?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
don't
you
think
it
means
that
the
states
cannot
render
the
arbitral
forum
nugatory
by
simply
saying,
yes,
we
have
a
general
law,
but
this
law
won't
be
applicable
in
an
arbitral
forum?
that
seems
to
me
to
violate
the--
unknown
speaker
--it
may
be
this
case,
because
if
this
provision
of
new
york
law
is
totally
preempted
and
is
only
there
so
it's
a
handy
referral
for
a
private
agreement,
which
we've
said
can
supersede
the
faa,
then
maybe
it's
not
new
york
law
any
more.
i
mean,
if
it
has
no
binding
effect
in
and
of
itself,
maybe
it's
not
new
york
law.
i
mean,
i
don't
consider
it
law
if
it's
just
something
that
can
be
referred
to
by
the
parties
if
they
want
to
adopt
it,
but
that
could
not
be
imposed
upon
the
parties
absent
their
agreement.
you
think
this
could
be
imposed
on
the
parties
absent
their
agreement.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
this
always--
--it
seems
to
me
that
your
case
may
very
well
turn
on
that,
because
it
strikes
me
as
rather
odd
that
if
the
parties
simply
agree
to
arbitrate
without
a
choice
of
law
clause
or
a
mention
of
new
york,
and
it
happens
to
be
that
the
transaction
is
in
new
york,
the
parties
are
in
new
york,
they
apply
new
york
law,
that
they
would
apply
the
federal
preemptive
portion
of
new
york
law
and
ignore
the
garrity
rule.
it
seems
to
me
rather
strange
that
when
the
parties
go
one
further
step
and
say,
we
want
new
york
law,
that
suddenly
you
interpret
the
contract
as
saying
we
want
new
york
law
absent
prevailing
federal
preemption
law.
that
seems
to
me
very
odd.
unknown
speaker
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
you
have
to
say
in
order
to
win
your
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
polizzotto,
on
the
question
of
what
the
parties
could
dispose
of,
these...
the
mastrobuonos,
as
i
understand
it,
brought
this
case
in
federal
district
court,
and
you
removed
it,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
so
if
they
had
brought
this
case
in
new
york
federal
district
court,
or
they
brought
it
in
illinois
federal
district
court
and
said,
see
this
choice
of
law
clause,
shall
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
new
york,
and
so
we
want
compensatory
and
punitive
damages,
suppose
you
had
not
asked
to
have
the
case
dismissed
because
of
the
arbitration
clause.
you
were
not
required
to
do
that.
that
was
something
that
no
law
required,
no
illinois
law,
no
new
york
law,
no
federal
law.
it
was
yours
to
dispose
of.
so
if
they
had
just
gone
into
federal
court,
and
you
hadn't
asked
to
have
the
arbitral
forum,
they
would
have
gotten
compensatory
and
punitive
damages,
right,
assuming
they
proved
their
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
why
i
keep
coming
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
original
question.
the
question
as
you
see
it
is,
what
did
they
agree
to?
unknown
speaker
in
my
agreement,
it
says
they
agree
to
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
new
york,
and
then
they
also
agree
that
any
controversy
will
be
settled
by
the
nasd
rules.
the
nasd
rules
specifically
say
in
their
arbitrator's
manual
that
punitive
damages
may
be
a
remedy,
so
it
seems...
why
isn't
there
at
least
an
ambiguity
as
to
what
they
meant,
and
once
you
find
an
ambiguity,
then
why
aren't
we
simply
required
to
follow
what
the
arbitrator
interpreted
them
to
mean?
unknown
speaker
but
beside...
that's...
all
i'm
saying
is,
isn't
it
at
least
ambiguous
as
to
what
they
meant,
and
once
you
find
it
even
a
little
bit
ambiguous,
then
doesn't
the
court...
don't
the
courts
have
to
follow
the
arbitrator's
interpretation
of
the
contract
as
to
what
they
meant?
in
other
words,
isn't
this
case
way
north
of
misco?
you
don't
have
to
get,
you
know,
too
technical
about
it.
there's
at
least
a
big
ambiguity
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
misco
says,
yes,
that's
right,
but
don't
ever
do
it,
and
that's
in
the
labor
area,
so
maybe
we
always
used
to
follow
it
that
way
in
the
court
of
appeals,
anyway,
and
now
this
isn't
the
labor
area,
so
perhaps
because
it's
not
the
labor
area,
it
isn't
true
don't
every
do
it,
maybe
sometimes
do
it,
but
at
least
there...
there
i'm
exaggerating,
but
you
see
my
point.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know,
but
i'm
trying
to
get
your
answer
to
the
question
specifically,
isn't
there
at
least
enough
ambiguity
as
to
what
they
meant
that
we'd
have
to
follow
the
arbitrator?
why
not?
is
it
because
the
arbitrator
didn't
give
that
as
a
reason?
is
it
because
there
really
isn't
that
ambiguity?
what,
in
your
view,
is
the
basic
reason--
unknown
speaker
--why
we
don't
have
to
follow
the
arbitrator?
unknown
speaker
normally
we
pay
no
attention
to
that,
except
in
extreme
circumstances,
in
a
court
of
appeals.
that
is,
normally
an
arbitration
award
has
no
reasons,
so
normally
you
don't
really
cross-examine
the
arbitrator.
unknown
speaker
why
is
this
different?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
next
sentence
contradicted
that,
and
the
parties
say
all
kinds
of
things
in
their
brief.
the
first
said,
spirit
of
the
law,
the
second
one
said,
this
contract
means
new
york
substantive
law,
so
i
don't
think
you
can
hang
a
party
on
one
sentence
in
a
brief
that's
contradicted
by
the
next
sentence.
unknown
speaker
--that
means
we
don't
look
at
their
reason.
we
assume
that
they
would
have
given
a
right
reason.
so
if
they
would
have
given
a
right
reason
here,
namely,
he'd
said
specifically,
there
are
two
sentences
in
this
contract,
one
of
which
seems
to
contradict
the
other,
i
interpret
those
sentences
to
mean,
just
what
i
said,
why
would
that
exceed
his
power?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you're
saying
it's
so
clear.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
point
out
this
one
problem
with...
it's
the
first
sentence,
of
course,
we're
focusing
on
in
the
agreement,
and
it
says,
the
agreement
shall
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
thinking...
following
up
on
justice
ginsburg's
thought,
if
the
agreement
had
been
construed
in
the
federal
court
it
would
have
one
meaning.
if
it
was
construed
by
an
arbitrator,
it
would
have
a
different
meaning.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
if
the
trial
had
been
held
in
a
federal
court--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
had
not
removed
it.
unknown
speaker
then,
applying
the
laws
of
new
york,
the
agreement
would
have
a
different
meaning
than
it
was
given
in
this
case...
than
the
court
gave
it
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
different
if
this
first
sentence
had
said,
any
proceedings
held
pursuant
to
this
clause
shall
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york.
it
says,
the
agreement
shall
be
governed,
and
then
it's
odd
to
say
that
the
same
law
will
give
the
same
agreement
two
different
meanings,
depending
on
what
judge
is
interpreting
it.
unknown
speaker
paragraph
13
isn't
very
long.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
still
be
governed
by
the
same
law,
whether
brought
in
federal
court
or
in
arbitration,
to
wit,
the
law
that
you
can't
give
punitive
damages
in
arbitration.
that
rule
wouldn't
be
contradicted
by
the
federal
suit.
it
just
wouldn't
be
applicable
in
the
federal
suit.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
not
that
two
different
laws
would
be
applied.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
