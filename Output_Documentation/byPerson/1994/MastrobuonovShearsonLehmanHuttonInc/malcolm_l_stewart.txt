mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
briefs,
and
i
think
in
the
cases,
we've
spent
a
lot
of
time
stressing
the
similarities
between
labor
arbitration
and
federal
arbitration
act
arbitration,
but
i
think
there's
one
respect
in
which
the
two
are
different
that's
fairly
central
to
this
case.
that
is,
in
labor
arbitration,
the
arbitrator's
power
is
typically
restricted
to
the
interpretation
and
the
enforcement
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
itself,
and
if
a
dispute
arises
between
an
individual
employee
and
the
employer
based
upon
some
other
source
of
law...
for
instance,
a
title
vii
claim...
typically
that
would
not
be
resolved
by
the
arbitrator,
it
would
be
resolved
in
a
judicial
forum
just
as
though
there
were
no
collective
bargaining
agreement.
under...
in
commercial
arbitration
under
the
faa,
the
thing
is
really
fundamentally
different.
that
is,
you
do
have
a
contract
here.
it's
certainly
possible
that
the
mastrobuonos
could
have
filed
an
action
for
breach
of
contract
contending
that
shearson
lehman
had
breached
its
contractual
duties,
but
the
arbitrator's
authority
is
not
limited
to
suits
arising
under
the
agreement
itself.
typically,
the
presumption
is
that
the
arbitrator
will
resolve
disputes
arising
under
all
sorts
of
different
other
provisions
of
law
that
happened
to
involve
the
same
transactions,
and
the
arbitration
agreement
here
stated
that
it
would
apply
to
all
disputes
arising
out
of
or
involving
the
petitioner's
accounts,
and
consequently
it
was
always
within
the
natural
contemplation
of
the
parties
that
the
arbitrator
might
ultimately
be
called
upon
to
apply
a
variety
of
different
bodies
of
law.
and
therefore
when
the
contract
said
that
the
contract,
the
agreement
would
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york,
it
certainly
implied
that
a
breach
of
contract
action
would
be
governed
by
that
law,
but
it
certainly
didn't
imply
that
every
aspect
of
every
dispute
between
the
parties
would
be
so
governed.
and,
in
fact,
here
the
petitioner
has
filed
claims
based
on
federal
securities
laws,
based
on
illinois
and
texas
law.
obviously
nobody
contended
that
new
york
law
should
have
applied
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
a
question
of
contract
interpretation
subject
to
two
caveats.
first,
that
the
policies
underlying
the
faa
are
influential
in
the
interpretation
of
the
contract,
although
they
don't
preclude
the
parties
from
agreeing
to
waive
punitive
damages
if
they
wish,
and
second,
it's
our
view
that
because
this
comes
down
to
a
matter
of
contract
interpretation,
ultimately
great
deference
is
owed
to
the
views
of
the
arbitrator,
and
therefore--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
typically
the
case,
your
honor,
that
arbitrators
will
not
give
the
reasons
for
their
awards.
this
court
recognized
that
in
the
steelworkers'
trilogy,
particularly
in
enterprise
wheel,
and
the
fact
that
the
arbitrator
doesn't
make
clear
what
the
basis
for
his
opinion
is
doesn't
mean
that
we
don't
defer,
so
long
as
there
is...
in
a
sense
it's
like
review
of
an
act
of
congress,
and
the
question
is
whether
we
can
hypothesize
a
valid
basis
for
the
award,
rather
than
whether
there
is
a
statement.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it's
certainly
true
that
some
of
the
factors
that
this
court
has
relied
on
in
the
labor
cases
in
stressing
the
difference
owed
to
the
arbitrator
are
unique
to
labor.
however,
this
court
also
recognized
in
wilko
v.
swan
that
the
arbitrator's
decision
under
the
faa
is
not
subject
to
review
for
legal
error.
the
court
has
continued
to
recognize
in
mcmahon,
for
instance,
that
the
bases
for
overturning
the
arbitrator's
decision
remain
limited,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
uniformly
been
of
the
view
that
an
arbitrator
cannot
be
said
to
exceed
his
powers
simply
because
the
reviewing
court
believes
that
the
arbitrator
got
wrong
the
question
of
contract
interpretation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
gross
or
clear
error.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
would
certainly
agree
that
if
the
arbitrator
said,
i'm
ignoring
the
contract
and
acting
on
the
basis
of
my
own
views
of
justice,
that
award
should
not
be
sustained
even
if
we
could
imagine
a
valid
basis.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
think,
with
respect,
your
honor,
that
that's
what
he
said.
what
he
said
was
that
he
was
awarding
punitive
damages
based
on
the
authority
as
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief
to
the
arbitrator,
and
the
petitioners
made
a
number
of
arguments,
some
of
which
are
quite
similar
to
the
ones
that
we're
making
today,
namely
that
if
punitive
damages
are
awardable
in
a
judicial
forum
they
should
ordinarily
be
awarded
in
arbitration
as
well.
one
of
the
other
things
they
said,
and
it
was
really
just
a
passing
comment,
was
to
the
effect
that
the
arbitrator
could
look
to
the
spirit
rather
than
the
letter
of
the
agreement,
but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
guess
there
are
about
three
different
answers
i
should
give.
first,
the
reviewing
court
will
typically
be
unsure,
because
typically
arbitrators
give
no
explanation
at
all,
so
that
really
can't
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
the
explanation
was,
i'm
doing
it
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
and
i
think
probably
the
best
indication...
it's
about
a
four-page
brief.
it
contains
a
number
of
arguments.
one
of
them
was,
you
can
look
to
the
spirit
rather
than
the
letter
of
the
agreement,
but
even
that
was
taken
as
a
direct
quotation
from
a
new
york
court
of
appeals
case
which
said,
arbitrators
can
look
to
the
spirit
rather
than
the
letter
of
the
parties'
agreement,
so
even
that
isolated
sentence
was
not
an
appeal
to
ignore
the
law,
it
was
simply
a
statement
of
what
the
law
was.
as
to
the
first
options
case,
one
of
the
questions
presented
is,
if
a
district
court
denies
a
motion
to
vacate
an
award,
what
should
the
standard
of
review
be
on
appeal,
and
the
flip
side
is
the
question
presented
here,
namely,
when
a
district
court
grants
a
motion
to
vacate
an
award,
what
is
the
standard
of
review?
the
conflict
in
the
first
options
case
is
between
the
third
circuit,
which
says
de
novo
review
of
denial
of
a
motion
to
vacate,
the
eleventh
circuit
which
says
an
abuse
of
discretion
review.
but
even
the
eleventh
circuit
in
robbins
v.
day,
which
is
discussed
in
the
petition
in
first
options,
said
that
when
you
have
granted
a
motion
to
vacate,
that
should
be
reviewed
but
de
novo,
so
i
think
under
the
standard
of
any
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit
was
correct
in
reviewing
de
novo
the
determination
of
the
district
court
that
the
arbitrable
award
should
be
vacated.
i
want
to
address
just
briefly
a
comment
that
justice
souter--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
as
i
say,
there
were
a
number
of
arguments
made
in
that
brief,
many
of
which
are
similar
to
the
ones
that
we're
making
today,
so
it
was
not
at
all
a
brief
which
in
its
essence
asked
the
arbitrator
to
avoid
applying
the
contract,
it
was
essentially
a
brief
about
how
the
contract
should
be
interpreted.
i
want
to
return
to
a
question
justice
souter
asked
as
to
whether
this
is
a
case
about
the
arbitrator's
authority,
and
i
think
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
issues
that
may
arise
about
authority.
one
is
arbitrability
jurisdiction,
whether
a
particular
claim
or
grievance
or
cause
of
action
was
properly
presented
to
the
arbitrator
rather
than
to
the
court,
and
certainly
there
are
a
number
of
this
court's
decisions
saying
that
the
determination
on
that
issue
is
for
the
court,
albeit
with
a
presumption
of
arbitrability.
this
is
not
a
case
about
arbitrability.
this
is
a
case
in
which
it
is
clear
that
the
determination
as
to
whether
punitive
damages
should
be
awarded
is
to
be
made
by
the
arbitrator.
the
only
question
is,
what
standard
of
law
should
the
arbitrator
apply,
and
the
court
has
held
in
enterprise
wheel,
in
misco,
in
w.
h.
grace,
that
when
a
claim
is
clearly
properly
before
the
arbitrator,
the
arbitrator's
determination
as
to
what
remedies
are
appropriate
is
typically
entrusted
to
his
sound
discretion,
and
that's
particularly
true
here
when
the
propriety
of
the
remedy
turns
on
interpretation
of
the
contract.
that
is,
the
respondents
don't
contend
that
the
garrity
rule
applies
of
its
own
force.
they
don't
contend
that
there
is
some
other
provision
of
law
which
bars
an
award
of
punitive
damages.
they
simply
contend
that
the
contract
properly
construed
reflects
the
parties'
agreement
that
punitive
damages
will
not
be
awarded.
the
question
of
whether
they're
right
is
a
question
of
contract
interpretation.
the
arbitrator
evidently
reached
a
different
determination,
and
that
judgment
is
entitled
to
substantial
deference
from
the
reviewing
court.
as
to
volt,
we
think
really
that's
the
fundamental
difference
between
this
case
and
volt.
in
volt,
the
state
court
determined
that
the
choice
of
law
clause
was
properly
construed
to
incorporate
california
procedural
rules.
this
court
said,
we
won't
review
that
determination.
assuming
it's
correct,
the
faa
does
not
prohibit
enforcing
the
agreement
according
to
its
terms.
here,
by
contrast,
the
decisionmakers
whose
judgment
is
entitled
to
deference,
namely
the
arbitrators,
concluded
that
the
choice
of
law
clause
did
not
have
that
effect...
i'm
sorry.
thank
you,
your
honor.
