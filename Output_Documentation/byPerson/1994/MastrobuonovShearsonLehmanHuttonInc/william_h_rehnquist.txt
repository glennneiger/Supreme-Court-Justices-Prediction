we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number

antonio
mastrobuono
v.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
polizzotto.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
the
mastrobuono
versus
shearson
lehman
hutton,
number
94-18.
in
this
case
the
mastrobuonos
entered
into
a
contract
with
shearson,
whereby
shearson
agreed
to
handle
their
securities
trading
account,
the
terms
of
the
contract
were
spelled-out
in
shearson’s
standard
form
agreement.
paragraph
13
of
that
agreement
contains
a
choice
of
law
provision
stating
that
“the
agreement
shall
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york”.
it
also
contains
an
arbitration
clause
stating
“all
disputes
arising
out
of
the
agreement
shall
be
resolved
by
arbitration.”
the
mastrobuonos
later
sued
shearson
in
federal
district
court
claiming
that
it
had
mishandled
their
securities
account
and
shearson
filed
a
motion
to
enforce
the
arbitration
clause
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
court
granted
the
motion
and
a
penal
of
arbitrators
was
appointed.
after
hearings
the
arbitrators
ruled
in
favor
of
the
mastrobuonos
and
awarded
both
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
shearson
challenged
the
punitive
damages
component
of
the
award
arguing
that
under
the
agreement
the
arbitrator
should
have
applied
new
york
law,
and
the
new
york
law
allows
only
courts
but
not
arbitrators
to
award
punitive
damages.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
shearson.
in
an
opinion
written
by
justice
stevens
and
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reverse.
the
central
purpose
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
to
insure
that
private
agreements
to
arbitrator
are
enforced
according
to
their
terms.
if
the
parties
to
this
contract
agreed
to
allow
punitive
damages
to
be
awarding
the
arbitration
then
the
arbitrator’s
award
must
be
enforced.
we
think
the
contract
is
best
read
to
allow
punitive
damages
because
the
arbitration
clause
indicates
that
punitive
damages
maybe
awarded
at
the
discretion
on
the
arbitrator.
we
rule
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
and
uphold
the
award
of
punitive
damages.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
