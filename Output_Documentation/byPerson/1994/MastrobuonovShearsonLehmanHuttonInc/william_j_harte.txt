mr.
william
j.
harte
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
a
straightforward
one
identified
by
paragraph
13
of
the
client's
agreement
which
was
presented
to
the
mastrobuonos...
antonio
mastrobuono,
a
teacher
of
medieval
history,
and
his
wife,
an
artist,
and
the
client's
agreement
provision
provides,
in
relevant
part,
this
agreement
shall
be
governed
by
the
state
of
new
york.
this
is
a
choice-of-law
clause.
it
then
moves
forward
into
a
comprehensive
arbitration
agreement.
now,
the
point
i
guess
which
we
diverge
on,
myself
and
shearson's
counsel,
is
just
essentially
what
was
agreed
by
the
mastrobuonos.
parenthetically,
to
suggest
that
they
agreed
to
give
up
any
substantive
rights
knowingly
is
preposterous,
but
what
they
are
said
to
have
agreed.
they
are
said
to
have
agreed
to
the
garrity
rule
by
the
first
sentence
of
paragraph
13.
the
garrity
rule,
a
rule
in
new
york
of
approximately
20
years,
states
essentially
that
arbitrators
are
not
empowered
to
grant
punitive
damages,
and
therefore,
essentially,
resort
must
have
to
be
taken
to
the
judicial
forum.
you
move
to
the
next
aspect
of
the
agreement,
the
comprehensive
agreement
which
relates
to
arbitration,
and
it
is
straightforward.
they
agree
to
arbitrate
any
controversy
arising
out
of
or
relating
to
my
accounts,
the
transactions
with
you,
your
officers,
directors,
agents,
or
employees,
the
grants
that
say
they
shall
be
settled
by
arbitration
in
accordance
with
the
rules
in
effect
of
the
national
association
of
securities
dealers.
now,
the
point
that
we
have
sought
to
stress
in
our
papers
is
that
either
the
faa
is
going
to
be
employed
or
it
isn't,
so
if
the
assertion
is
that
the
only
judicial
forum...
the
only
forum
in
new
york
available
for
punitive
damages
to
the
mastrobuonos
is
a
judicial
forum,
because
of
the
comprehensive
nature
of
the
arbitration,
and
the
statements
of
this
court
time
and
again
that
if
punitive
damages
are
to
be
obtained
only
in
the
judicial
forum,
then
there
is
a
preemption
because
federal
law
applies--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--it
can
be,
yes,
but--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--well,
there
was
a
reference
made
in
the
arbitrator's
award
that
reliance
was
placed
upon
some
papers
filed
by
the
mastrobuonos.
we
assert
in
our
supplemental
brief
that,
indeed,
within
those
papers
was
a
statement
that,
look,
there
is
preemption,
and
i
frankly
don't
know
and
can't
help
you,
because
all
i
have
is
what
the
arbitrator
said,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
they
had
to
interpret
it
in
order
to
get
to
a
resolution.
they
had
in
front
of
them--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--agreed--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--they
would--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--it
would
be
my
view
that
necessarily
they
would
have
had
to
do
that,
and
did,
because
the
issues
were
all
presented
to
them.
if
we
are
to
look
into
that
determination,
necessarily
you
would
have
to
assume
that
they
had
interpreted
what
the
parties
had
agreed
to
and
what
they
had
not
agreed
to.
mr.
william
j.
harte
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--but
what...
the
garrity
rule
states
that
you
do
have
punitive
damages.
you
have
them
in
a
judicial
forum.
mr.
william
j.
harte
however,
you
cannot
get
them--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--from
an
arbitrator.
mr.
william
j.
harte
no.
mr.
william
j.
harte
because--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--yes.
however,
you
move
to
the
next
sentence.
the
next
sentence
in
the
comprehensive
arbitration
agreement
is
that
the
parties
are
going
to
arbitrate
any
controversy.
now,
at
that
point,
one
of
the
controversies
would
be
that
the
mastrobuonos
were
entitled
to
punitive
damages
in
a
judicial
forum.
now,
if
you--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--yes.
mr.
william
j.
harte
yes.
mr.
william
j.
harte
yes.
mr.
william
j.
harte
yes.
one
of
our
points
is
that
the
ambiguity--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--yes.
mr.
william
j.
harte
that's
correct.
however--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--i
would
respectfully
submit,
justice
souter,
that
if
the
nasd
rules
are
interpreted
themselves,
they're
interpreted
by
the
manual
and
the
manual
addresses
the
arbitrators
that
they
are
permitted
to
grant
punitive
damages.
mr.
william
j.
harte
well,
i
assume
that
they
are
required
if
they're
going
to
arbitrate
any
controversy,
and
one
of
the
controversies
was
punitive
damages.
mr.
william
j.
harte
if
it's
given
to
them,
they
must--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--well,
my
position
is
that...
no.
my
position
is
that
when
you
put
in
a
comprehensive
arbitration
agreement
to
arbitrate
any
controversy,
then
the
nasd
rules
are
required
to
move
forward
with
that
issue,
and
the
arbitrators
must
address
it
because
obviously
it
is
a
controversy
then
that
would
be
left
not
resolved.
mr.
william
j.
harte
yes.
mr.
william
j.
harte
under
the
faa?
mr.
william
j.
harte
under
the
faa,
it
is
my
view
that
the
arbitrators
can,
should,
and
must
award
punitive
damages--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--if
it
is
a
controversy.
mr.
william
j.
harte
i
do
not
believe
that
is
an
issue.
i
believe
that
is
resolved,
has
been
resolved
continuously
in--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--respectfully,
i
believe
the
issue
is
resolved
with
the
arbitrator's
determination,
and--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--as
to
the
authority?
i
believe
that
the
faa,
as
it
has
been
construed
by
this
court,
states
essentially
that
where
the
parties
agree
to
arbitrate
any
controversy,
which
is
the
issue
here...
any
controversy...
and
it
is
given
to
the
arbitrators,
then
they
have
the
authority--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--the
power--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--the
power
of
the
arbitrators,
i
would
say
yes,
we
have
stated
that
that
is
an
issue.
the
united
states
says
that
it
is
not
an
issue.
it
is
not
an
issue
to
be
resolved
by
the
courts.
once
the
arbitrators
have
determined
the
scope
of
the
agreement
and
their
authority,
it
is
not
subject
to
appeal
to
the
court
system.
mr.
william
j.
harte
yes.
mr.
william
j.
harte
yes.
that
would
be--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--yes.
it
is
stated
in
our
papers,
assuming
there
is
no
choice
of
law
agreement,
assuming
the
most
significant
context
rule
is
applied
in
conflict,
assuming
that
the
choice
of
law
is
necessarily
under
the
new
york
law...
new
york
law,
and
the
garrity
rule
applies
to
new
york
law...
it
is
clear
that
when,
in
our
view,
anyway,
where
you
agree
to
a
comprehensive
resolution
to
resolve
any
controversy,
that
the
federal
law
would
preempt
the
new
york
law.
mr.
william
j.
harte
yes.
mr.
william
j.
harte
correct,
that
it
is
the
federal
law
which
applies
to
the
comprehensive
arbitration
agreement--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--and
we
state
that...
excuse
me.
mr.
william
j.
harte
well,
the...
if
i
can
just
continue
a
response...
well,
i
will
respond
to
volt.
it
is,
i
guess,
to
some
surprise
that
we
look
at
volt
differently
from
the
other
side.
it
would
seem
that
everybody
would
simply
accept
volt
as
written,
you
know,
what
was
said,
but
our
position
is
that
volt
is
entirely
consistent
to
your
decision
in
volt,
because
what
you
said
there
is,
look,
we're
going
to
take
a
look
at
what's
happening
here,
and
if
the
california
statute
is
such
that
it
says
we're
going
to
wait
with
respect
to
arbitration,
there
are
other
litigants
involved,
the
issue
may
be
resolved,
there
is
no
magic
in
the
procedure,
it
does
not
appear
to
us
to
be
inconsistent
with
what
the
faa
is
seeking
to
do.
there
is
no
removal
of
our
right
under
arbitration,
and
you
state,
quote,
if
i
may,
the
faa
"preempts
state
laws
which
require
a
judicial
forum
for
the
resolution
of
claims
which
the
contracting
parties
agree
to
resolve
by
arbitration.
"
so
what
i
say
is
that
also
in
volt
you
said
sections
3
and
4
have
never
been
applied
to
state
fori,
only
to
district
court,
but
we're
dealing
with
section
2,
and
we're
dealing
with
entirely
different
issue
here.
this
issue
is
that
the
garrity
rule
forecloses
punitive
damages
in
an
arbitrable
forum,
and
that
is
why
i
return
again
and
again
to
what
was
agreed.
there
was
agreed
a
choice
of
law
forum
which,
if
you
accept
their
view,
stated
to
the
mastrobuonos
you
must
go
to
a
judicial
forum
in
order
to
obtain
punitive
damages
under
the
choice
of
law.
but
then
you
go
to
the
arbitration
agreement,
the
next
sentence,
and
it
fits
entirely
into
what
you've
said
in
volt,
quoting
from
perry
v.
thomas,
that
state
law
must
give
way
if
the
only
way
a
person
can
get
a
remedy
is
to
go
to
a
judicial
forum,
and
they
have
been...
they
have
entered
into
this
arbitration
agreement.
and
for
example,
in
perry
v.
thomas,
the
california...
state
of
california
said
in
order
to
get
a
wage
situation
resolved
they
had
to
go
to
a
judicial
forum,
and
what
you
said
is
that
the
state
law
must
give
way
if...
if
the
state
law
says
judicial
forum
alone,
and
it
leads
from
the
decision.
you
see
it
in
mcmahon,
the
concern
about
arbitration,
the
jealousy
of
the
courts,
and
it
is
very
paradoxical
and
ironic
that
this
sophisticated
group...
the
sic,
the
industry
and
what...
would
fight
for
arbitration,
would
fight
for
this
panel
of
three
sophisticated
people,
would
state
that
judges
and
juries
were
not
to
be
trusted,
and
then
weep
and
whine
and
hand-ring
about
the
decision
made
in
the
forum
that
they
wanted
by
this
mumbo-jumbo
now-you-see-it,
now-you-don't--
mr.
william
j.
harte
--yes.
mr.
william
j.
harte
well,
if
you
move
into
a
requirement,
and
i
simply
state
that
the
choice
of
law
of
new
york
adopts
the
law,
that's
not
preempted
by
federal
law.
federal
law
applies
to
that
second
sentence.
mr.
william
j.
harte
that's
what
i'm
saying,
and
that's
preemption.
mr.
william
j.
harte
yes.
mr.
william
j.
harte
correct,
but
if...
if
it
is
said
that
you
cannot
get
punitive
damages
in
an
arbitra...
see,
the
mastrobuonos
get
hit
twice.
first,
they
are
said
to
have
waived
their
right
to
punitive
damages
in
any
place
but
a
judicial
forum.
then
they
move
to
the
next
sentence
and
say
they're
going
to
arbitrate
any
controversy,
and
then
it
is
claimed
that
they
can't
get
punitive
damages
at
arbitration
because
again
they're
hit
with
a
choice
of
law
forum.
