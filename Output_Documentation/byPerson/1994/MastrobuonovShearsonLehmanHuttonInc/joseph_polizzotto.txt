mr.
joseph
polizzotto
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
somewhat
confused
by
the
preemption
argument
advanced
by
the
petitioner.
he's
gone
back
and
forth
on
that
issue
in
the
past.
in
our
reading
of
this
court's
cases,
particularly
the
volt
case,
the
overriding,
if
not
the
sole
concern
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
is
the
enforcement
of
the
parties'
agreement
according
to
their
terms.
this
court
has
said
that
repeatedly
in
virtually
every
case
decided
in
the
mid
to
late
eighties
on
the
arbitration
subject,
and
perhaps
most
explicitly
as
it
pertains
to
this
case
in
the
volt
decision.
the
preemptive
force,
if
any,
that
the
faa
has,
is
with
respect
to
attempting
to
determine
what
the
agreement
of
the
party
was...
what
the
agreement
of
the
parties
were,
so
i
am
somewhat
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
argument
of
preemption
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
that
arguably
might
foreclose
the
award
of
damages,
because
the
claims
sought
to
be
brought
under
the
faa
included
claims
for
compensatory
damages.
however,
the
preemptive
force
of
the
faa
with
respect
to
what
the
parties'
agreement
is,
in
my
view,
paramount
and
dispositive
here.
the
contract
argument
now
being
advanced
here
was
not
advanced
below.
in
our
view,
the
only
fair
reading
of
the
contract,
and
the
clear
constraint
on
arbitral
authority
here,
was
that
new
york
law
applies,
new
york
law
includes
the
garrity
rule,
which
is
clear
and
unmistakable,
and
the
arbitrators
exceeded
their
power
under
section
1084
of
the
faa
in
not
permitting
an
award
of
punitive...
and
permitting--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--i've
several
responses
to
that.
first
of
all,
under
new
york
law,
it's
fairly
clear
that
the
garrity
rule
itself
is
a
substantive
rule.
it
is
more
than
simply
a
procedural
rule.
there's
an
extremely
strong
and
powerful
policy
under
new
york
law,
and
a
fair
reading
of
chief
judge
bertel's
opinion
i
think
reveals
that.
in
addition,
on
their
face--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--i
think
that
would
have
been
a
terribly
confusing
way
of
going
about
the
issue,
had
they
done
so.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
correct.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
but
the
nasd
rules
themselves
are
totally
silent
on
the
issue
of
punitive
damages.
there's--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--to
the
extent...
to
the
extent
that
the
parties'
agreement
otherwise
would
prohibit
them,
and
in
this
case
the
adoption
of
the
new
york
choice
of
law
provision,
sweeping
in
the
garrity
rule,
makes
that
prohibition--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--well--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--the
submission
itself,
the
submission
of
the
dispute
itself
before
the
nasd
contemplated
in
the
submission...
this
is
section
12
of
the
nasd
code
of
arbitration.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
yes.
page
29
in
my
brief.
i'm
reading
from
the
nasd
code
of
arbitration
procedure,
section
12(a).
the
claim
is
submitted
before
the
arbitrators
as
provided
by
a
duly
executed
and
enforceable
written
agreement.
the
claim
itself
incorporates--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--i'm
reading
from
the
quote
of
the
rule,
actually,
which
is
the
block
in
indented
quote
on
page
29
of
the
respondent's
brief.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
it
includes
other
material
provisions
in
the
contract
of
which
the--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--yes,
of
respondent's
brief,
page
29.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
i
was
reading...
i
was
paraphrasing
section
12
of
the
nasd
code
of
arbitration
procedure.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
no.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
well,
i
would
say
this.
virtually
every
case
that
has
reviewed
this
question,
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
new
york
choice
of
law
provision
and
whether
it
involves
an
exceeding
of
arbitral
powers,
has
taken
a
fresh
de
novo
review
and
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
appropriate
course
here.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
i
guess
i
don't
see
the--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--i
guess
i
don't
see
the
conflict,
because
the
choice
of
law
provision
in
our
agreement
is
the
preceding
sentence
to
the
dispute
resolution
provision,
if
you
will,
and
i
think
for...
a
better
and
more
appropriate
construction
is
that
they're
one
and
the
same,
for
this
purpose.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
probably
yes,
and
let
me
explain
why.
the
court
has
made
quite
clear
that
the
faa
does
not
preempt
the
whole
law
of
arbitration,
and
in
fact
there
needs
to
be
a
clear
and
unmistakable
congressional
intent
to
preempt.
there's
nothing
in
the
faa
that
says
anything
about
punitive
damages,
so
in
the
absence
of
an
agreement
between
the
parties
on
this
question,
i
think
it
is
entirely
possible
that
a
state
rule
such
as
this
would
have
applicability
when
new
york
law
applies
of
its
own
force.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
so
we
disagree
with
the
government
on
that
point.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
well,
the
faa
has
preemptive
force
in
the
context
in
which
people
are
attempting
to
derive
or
get
access
to
the
arbitral
forum
as
an
initial
matter.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
it
may
mean
that,
justice
scalia,
but
that's
not
this
case.
this
case
is
a
far
clearer
case.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
i
think
there's
an
argument
to
suggest
that
the
faa
does
not
have
the
type
of
preemptive
force
that
would
override
the
natural
power
of
new
york
law,
in
an
appropriate
case.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
well,
it's--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--well,
i
think
that's
right
to
some
extent,
but
that's
because
the
animating
policy
and
the
animating
preemptive
force
of
the
faa
is,
what
did
the
parties
agree
to
in
this
case?
so
that's
why
i
believe
justice
o'connor
was
correct
in
the
very
first
question
that
she
asked
the
petitioner,
that
fundamentally
here
what
we
are
talking
about
is
what
did
the
agreement
provide?
we're
not--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--correct.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
and
assuming
that
the
judge
and
jury
would
have
agreed
the
same
way--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--that
the
arbitrators
did
here.
but
that
is
precisely
the
distinction
that
is
so
powerful
with
respect
to
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
provision
that
we
relied
on
to
compel
the
case
was,
of
course,
section
4
of
the
faa,
and
it
doesn't
say,
parties
who
are
signatories
to
arbitration
agreements,
you
can
get
orders
from
the
federal
court
directing
that
the
matter
proceed
in
arbitration.
what
it
says
is
that
parties
are
entitled
to
an
order
directing
that
such
manner...
arbitration
proceed
in
the
manner
provided
for
in
such
agreement.
again,
even
in
the
procedural,
largely
procedural
section
of
title
9
relating
to
motions
to
compel,
there
is
a
harkening
back
to
what
was
the
parties'
intent
under
the
agreement?
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
correct.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
the
rules
are...
the
manual
are
not
the
rules,
first
of
all.
the
manual
is
the
manual.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
i
think
the
issue
of
arbitral
power...
i
think
to
some
extent
you're
underestimating
the
force
of
section
10
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
which
specifically
gives
to
the
courts...
it's
a
directive
to
the
courts
that
says,
you
are
obligated
to
vacate
awards
to
the
extent
that
the
arbitrators
have
exceeded
their
authority.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
but
there
seems
to
me
to
be
a
distinction,
and
a
valid
one,
between
the
question
of
whether
an
arbitrator
has
the
power
to
award
such
relief--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--and
the
question
of
whether,
under
the
facts
of
a
given
case,
the
arbitrators
correctly
exercised
that
power.
we're
saying
that
this
is
the
former
situation.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
well,
one--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--one
clear
answer
to
that
is
the
fact
that
this
is
not
what
the
arbitrators
were
asked
to
do
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
part
of
the
record--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--part
of
the
record
in
the
district
court
was
the
submission
made
by
the
petitioners
in
which
they
urged
the
arbitration
panel
to
disregard
the
law,
disregard
the
authority
and
the
constraints
on
that
authority
placed
in
the
agreement
that
you
signed.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
except
in
this
case
the
application,
i
believe,
and
i
think
garrity's...
a
fair
reading
of
garrity
indicates
this.
the
garrity
rule,
as
it
relates
exclusively
to
arbitration,
is
a
substantive
pronouncement
of
law
in
the
state
of
new
york,
and
the
petitioners
concede
this
in
their
main
brief.
they
say
that
flat
out
in
their
brief.
i
would
also
say
in
partial
further
response
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
there's
a
happy
synergy,
if
you
will,
between
the
statutory
language
under
section
10,
which
speaks
about
arbitrators
exceeding
their
powers,
and
the
garrity
case
itself.
garrity,
chief
judge
bertel
uses
precisely
the
same
word
in
disposing
of
the
case
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
case.
he
says,
the
holding
of
this
court
is
that
the
arbitrators
do
not
have
the
power
to
award
punitive
damages.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
well,
i
suppose
i
don't
agree
with
your
interpretation
of
the
contract--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--and
i
don't
think
the
contract
is...
can
be
interpreted
in
that
fashion.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
i
think
to
some
extent
the
court
needs
to
focus
more
on
the
historic
purpose
of
choice
of
law
clauses
generally.
i
think
under
your
analysis,
justice
breyer,
the
clause
here
would
be
given
short
shrift.
in
fact,
they
are
very
important
aspects
to
american
jurisprudence.
they
sweep
in
a
whole
compendium
of
issues
that
might
otherwise
bear
on
a
dispute
that
parties
may
have
with
each
other.
they're
powerful.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
no,
because
this
particular
federal
court
construed
the
agreement
the
same
way.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
oh--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--there's
no
question
that--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--but
that's
precisely
the
difference.
we
are
in
arbitration.
the
parties
have
a
contract,
and
the
contract
defines
the
agreement,
and
the
difference
is,
is
that
the
garrity
rule
is
a
substantive
rule
that
only
relates
to
arbitrations.
that's
precisely
the
difference.
we're
not
contesting
that
these
individuals,
had
we
stayed
in
federal
court,
might
have
been
able
to
maintain
state
common
law
claims
that
might
have
had
as
a
component
some
element
of
punitive
damages.
of
course,
from
a
procedural
safeguard
perspective--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--this
is,
however,
a
rather
lengthy
agreement,
and
i
think
the
fact
that
these--
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
--these
two
thoughts
are
in
tandem
in
the
contract
is
of
some
significance.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
polizzotto
no,
that's
correct.
i
would
again
urge
the
court
that
with
respect
to
the
preemption
issue,
it's
really
a
nonissue
here.
volt
controls
that
most
particularly.
i
think
the
court
is
correct
in
focusing
on
the
contract
questions.
it's
our
view
that
the
contract
is
clear.
it's
also,
if
i
may
spend
a
few
minutes
on
the
section
10
argument,
i
think
the
government...
the
government's
advancement
of
their
argument
under
section
10
which,
by
the
way,
is
not
an
argument
that
the
petitioners
advanced
until
the
reply
brief,
is
an
overly
constrained
reading
of
the
proper
meaning
of
section
10(a)(4).
section
10(a)(4)
is
a
clear
directive
of
the
courts
to
act
in
appropriate
cases.
that
is
something
that
is
entitled
to
de
novo
action
on
the
part
of
the
courts,
and
to
read
it
in
any
other
fashion
does
violence
to
the
force
behind
it.
there
are
only
limited
bases
upon
which
arbitration
awards
can
be
vacated,
but
to
remove
that
basis,
which
is
i
think
effectively
what
the
government
is
arguing,
from
a
party
who
believes
to
be
aggrieved
from
an
arbitration
award
really
severely
undercuts
the
force
of
the
vacation
statute,
section
10.
if
the
court
doesn't
have
any
further
questions,
i
would
rest.
