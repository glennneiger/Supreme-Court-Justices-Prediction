mr.
paul
morris
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
applicability
of
title
18,
united
states
code,
section
1001,
often
referred
to
as
the
false
statement
statute,
to
statements
of
the
petitioner
made
in
the
course
of
bankruptcy
court
proceedings.
section
1001,
of
course,
prohibits
the
making
of
knowingly
false
statements
in
any
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
any
department
of
the
united
states.
our
position
is
essentially
twofold.
if
there
is
an
honest
debate
over
whether
the
term
1001
and/or
related
limitations
placed
upon
section
1001
by
the
various
courts
of
appeals
that
have
reached
this
issue.
very
briefly,
the
petitioner's
three
convictions
under
section
1001
arose
from
three
written
responses
made
through
counsel
during
the
course
of
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
these
responses
were
made
to
the
bankruptcy
trustee
as
a
result
of
inquiries
made
by
that
trustee.
the
first
two
convictions
arose
from
answers
to
the
bankruptcy
trustee's
complaint,
and
essentially
those
answers
consisted
of
the
words,
"denied
for
the
reason
that
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
are
untrue.
"
the
third
conviction
arose
as
a
result
of
a
discovery
dispute.
mr.
paul
morris
the
third
conviction
arose
as
a
result
of
a
discovery
dispute.
mr.
paul
morris
no,
they
were
not.
the
answer
to
the
complaint
was
signed
by
counsel
and
signed
by
the
petitioner,
but
not
under
oath,
and
the
discovery
response
was
not
signed
by
the
petitioner
at
all,
only
signed
by
counsel.
the
discovery
response
arose
as
a
result
of
the
trustee
asking
for
the
production
of
certain
documents
from
the
petitioner,
and
the
discovery
response
filed
by
counsel
stated
that
the
petitioner
had
turned
over
those
documents
to
the
prior
trustee.
later
on
in
the
bankruptcy
court
proceedings,
the
bankruptcy
judge
issued
an
order
directing
the
petitioner
to
turn
over
those
documents,
and
they
were
turned
over.
nevertheless,
the
petitioner
was
indicted
for
1001
as
a
result
of
that
response
in
the
discovery
issue,
and
that
comprised
the
third
of
the
three
convictions.
first,
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
that
the
determination
of
whether
1001
applies
at
all
to
the
courts
is
a
question
that
logically
and
necessarily
precedes
the
determination
of
whether
the
judicial
function
exception
applies
to
1001.
this
issue
is
not
just
fairly
included
within
the
question
presented
for
review,
it
is
a
necessary
predicate
to
a
determination
of
the
propriety
of
the
judicial
function
exception.
ours
is
a
plain
language
argument.
congress
used
the
word
in
1001,
"department".
congress
did
not--
mr.
paul
morris
--it
is,
your
honor,
dictum
in
bramblett
that
stands
in
our
way,
and
for
that
reason,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
court
will
run
into
the
problem
of
stare
decisis,
as
the
government
would
suggest.
stare
decisis,
of
course,
carries
particular
weight
in
a
statutory
construction
case,
but
not
the
kind
of
weight
the
government
suggests
it
should
carry
in
this
case,
because,
of
course,
we
are
addressing
dictum,
and
we
have
asked
the
court
to
recede
from
the
dictum
in
bramblett--
mr.
paul
morris
--well,
the
courts
of
appeals,
because
of
bramblett,
have
felt
constrained
to
hold
that
such
statement
that...
to
hold
that
1001
applies
to
the
courts
because
of
the
dictum
in
bramblett,
and
it
is
with
several
misgivings
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
noted
that.
in
fact,
this
is
one
such
case,
and
the
very
first
case
after
bramblett
was
that
type
of
case
also.
mr.
paul
morris
but
the
issue
before
bramblett,
your
honor,
was
not
a
statement
made
to
the
judiciary,
it
was
a
statement
made
to
the
legislative
branch,
and
in
fact--
mr.
paul
morris
--but
nevertheless,
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
uses
the
word,
18,
section
6,
and
that
definition
of
department
is
the
executive
departments,
and
it
was
explained
in
the
reviser's
notes
to
that
definition
of
department.
mr.
paul
morris
i'm
sorry?
mr.
paul
morris
no,
it
states
that--
mr.
paul
morris
--and
we
are
asking,
even
if
you
are
looking
at
the
holding
of
bramblett,
if
the
holding
of
bramblett
is
deemed
at
issue,
we're
asking
the
court
to
recede
from
the
holding
of
bramblett.
mr.
paul
morris
well,
technically,
yes,
we
are,
because
bramblett
did
not
involve...
in
the
sense
that
bramblett
did
not
involve
a
statement
to
the
judiciary,
yes.
if
the
court
finds
that
there's
no
principal
distinction
between
the
legislature
and
the
judiciary
for
the
purposes
of
examining
bramblett,
then
yes,
indeed,
we're
asking
the
court
to
recede
from
the
holding
as
well.
mr.
paul
morris
well,
there
isn't--
mr.
paul
morris
--yes,
and
bramblett
runs
counter
to
the
plain
language
argument
and
to
the
definition
supplied
by
congress
of
the
term
"department".
mr.
paul
morris
yes,
overrule,
if
we're
going
to
view
it
as
the
holding
of
bramblett
is
at
issue,
but
recede
if
we're
going
to
view
bramblett
as
only
standing
in
the
way
of
the
petitioner's
argument
as
far
as
the
dictum
is
concerned.
mr.
paul
morris
yes,
and
that
carries
particular
significance
in
drawing
the
distinctions
between
administrative
and
adjudicative
functions
that
have
been
drawn
in
the
judicial
function
exception.
if
we
are
to
understand
why
the
courts
of
appeals
have
had
such
widespread
acceptance
of
the
judicial
function
exception
and
the
justification
for
the
distinction
drawn
between
housekeeping
functions
and
adjudicate
functions,
all
we
need
to
do
is
look
at
bramblett
and
see
why
that
happened.
and
the
second
circuit
in
the
masterpol
decision,
when
that
circuit
adopted
the
judicial
function
exception,
probably
set
forth
the
most
cogent
explanation
of
that
distinction,
and
the
masterpol
decision
stated
that
in
viewing
bramblett
and
what
it
was
limited
to,
it
was
limited
to
a
statement
made
to
the
disbursing
office.
it
was
limited
to
the
legislature
as
far
as
administrative
function
was
concerned.
and,
therefore,
masterpol
said
the
reason
why
the
courts
of
appeals
are
justified
in
drawing
this
judicial
function
exception
is
so
that
bramblett
applies
to
the
legislature
in
the
same
way
that
1001
will
apply
to
the
judiciary,
only
insofar
as
the
administrative
functions
of
the
courts
are
concerned,
so
in
that
respect--
mr.
paul
morris
--well--
mr.
paul
morris
--no,
but
the
courts...
yes,
it's
fair
to
say,
but
the
courts
of
appeals
felt
that
that
was
a
justified
interpretation
of
the
statute,
because
congress
never
intended
that
that
statute
would
apply
to
statements
such
as
those
made
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
or
certainly
not
to
every
misrepresentation
made
in
every
federal
court.
mr.
paul
morris
if
it
fell
within
the
adjudicative
function,
arguably--
mr.
paul
morris
--under
that
factual
scenario,
it
may
be
arguable
that
there
would
be
an
exception
to
the
applicability
of
1001
as
well,
because
that
is
an
adjudicative
function
of
the
alj
even
though
it
is
within
the
executive
branch.
mr.
paul
morris
yes.
mr.
paul
morris
well,
though,
of
course--
mr.
paul
morris
--well--
mr.
paul
morris
--although
that
issue
is
not
precisely
before
the
court,
i
think
that
argument
can
be
made.
if
we
are
going
to
take
the
judicial
function
at
its
word,
and
what
it
represents
in
terms
of
how
limited
1001
should
be
in
the
judicial
proceeding,
i
think
an
argument
can
be
made
for
that.
mr.
paul
morris
i
would
rely
upon
what
all
the
circuits
have
held,
and
that
is
that
1001
was...
there
is
no
indication
of
congressional
intent
that
1001
would
have
that
broad
scope,
that
there
have
to
be
some
limitations,
and
the
reason--
mr.
paul
morris
--only
under...
only
because
of
the
rationale
of
the
judicial
function
exception
itself.
beyond
that,
no.
that
could
be
a
problem
in
that
scenario.
mr.
paul
morris
well,
as
i
stated,
i
think
an
argument
can
be
made
that
if
it
is
acting
in
an
adjudicative
function,
that
the
rationale
of
the
judicial
function
exception
could
apply
to
those
situations.
now--
mr.
paul
morris
--when
it
takes
on
the--
mr.
paul
morris
--well,
when
it's
acting
in
the
same
fashion
as
a
court,
the
same
functions
as
a
court.
mr.
paul
morris
yes.
holding
hearings--
mr.
paul
morris
--well,
witnesses--
mr.
paul
morris
--correct.
mr.
paul
morris
it
may...
it
may
be,
it
may
not
be.
i
think
it
would
turn
on--
mr.
paul
morris
--the
individual
facts.
well,
i
think
it
could
be,
and
i
think
the
argument
could
be
made
that
it
is,
but--
mr.
paul
morris
--yes.
mr.
paul
morris
yes.
mr.
paul
morris
well,
without
bramblett
i
think
the
argument
would
have
prevailed
in
the
courts
of
appeals
that
bramblett--
mr.
paul
morris
--well,
the
judicial
function
exception,
of
course,
is
an
outgrowth
of
the
bramblett
decision,
and
it
flowed
from
morgan's
discussion
of
traditional
trial
tactics
and
how
those
should
not
be
within
the
ambit
of
1001,
and
that--
mr.
paul
morris
--arguably,
yes.
they
could
have
been
punished
as
perhaps
obstruction
of
justice,
as
contempt.
certainly
the
discovery
response
would
subject
it
to
the
contempt
powers
of
the
bankruptcy
judge
if
there
had
been
a
violation
of
an
order.
certainly
rules
11
and
rules
37.
rule
11
sanctions
against
the
parties
or
the
litigants,
and
rule
37
sanctions
for
abuse
of
the
discovery
process.
mr.
paul
morris
that's
correct,
and
therein
lies
one
of
the
anomalies
of
the
government's
interpretation
of
1001.
perjury,
which
carries
a
greater
penalty
than
1001,
would
create
the
anomaly
that
a
person
who
makes
a
false
statement
in
court
not
under
oath
would
be
subjected
to
a
greater
punishment
than
a
person
who
is
under
oath
and
makes
a
false
statement,
and
that's
the
type
of
unintended
consequence
that
the
courts
of
appeals
were
concerned
with
in
carving
out
the
judicial
function
exception,
in
particular
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
1001
is
not
a
boundless
statute,
and
congress
never
intended
it
to
be
such.
mr.
paul
morris
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
the
petitioner's
statements,
we
would
submit,
if
the
court
is
going
to
approve
the
judicial
function
exception,
squarely
falls
within
the
adjudicative
functions
of
the
court,
and
if
the
exception
is
approved,
he
should
prevail.
there
is
also
a
related
private
civil--
mr.
paul
morris
--well,
my
understanding
is
that
the
perjury
statute
carries
5
years
and
$2,000,
and
then
a
violation
of
1001
carries
5
years
and
$10,000.
mr.
paul
morris
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
misspoke.
i
apologize.
the
petitioner
is
also
seeking
relief
under
the
private
civil
litigation
exception,
as
it
is
so-called,
from
the
second
circuit's
d'amato
case,
which
was
also
adopted
by
the
eleventh
circuit
in
london,
and
those
cases
held
that
1001
does
not
apply
to
civil
litigation
where
the
government
is
not
a
party.
the
rationale
of
those
decisions
applies
here
as
well.
and
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
morris
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
breadth
of
the
statute
which
the
government
is
advancing
today
is
truly
extraordinary,
and
perhaps
what
all
lawyers
and
litigants
must
be
concerned
about
if
the
interpretation
advanced
by
the
government
is
adopted
by
the
court
is
what
happens
if
they
lose
a
case
in
a
federal
civil
court
proceeding?
arguably,
statements
can
be
obtained
during
the
course
of
those
proceedings
in
unsworn
pleadings
or
oral
representations
to
a
court
or
jury
that
would
constitute
probable
cause
sufficient
for
a
charge
of
1001.
mr.
paul
morris
there
are
other
implications
involved
in
the
criminal
proceedings,
namely
the
constitutional
implications
that
are
not
involved
in
the
civil
proceedings,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
consequences
are
much
more
far-reaching
in
civil
because
of
the
absence
of
those
protections.
mr.
paul
morris
it
would
seem
to
me,
under
the
government's
interpretation,
that
1001
applies
to
those
situations
as
well,
but--
mr.
paul
morris
--yes.
mr.
paul
morris
well,
that
brings
us
back
to
the
government's
discussion
of
bramblett.
mr.
paul
morris
certainly
an
equally
and
perhaps
more
compelling
grave
concern
would
be
the
lawyers
and
litigants
in
that
situation
as
well,
so
the
breadth
that's
being
read
into
this
statute
by
the
government
cuts
virtually
cross
the
board,
and
how
can
it
reasonably
be
argued
that
congress
ever
intended
that
1001
would
have
such
a
reach
into
not
just
criminal
litigation,
but
into
civil
litigation?
what
happens
when
an
attorney
has
a
client
appear
in
his
office
on,
say,
the
eleventh
hour
of
a
statute
of
limitations
and
is
seeking
the
filing
of
a
civil
complaint?
under
the
government's
view
of
1001,
that
attorney
has
to
think
twice
about
filing
that
complaint.
that
attorney
has
to
be
concerned
where
the
attorney
is
not
that
much
concerned
today,
because
today
under
rule--
mr.
paul
morris
--but
the
realities
of
the
situation--
mr.
paul
morris
--but
what
happens,
your
honor,
when
the...
that
client
who
comes
to
that
lawyer
at
the
eleventh
hour
is
making
misrepresentations
that
wind
up
in
that
complaint
and
the
lawyer
doesn't
find
that
out
till
after
it's
filed?
under
the
present
state
of
law--
mr.
paul
morris
--which...
which
should
once
we
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
afford
the
court
small
consolation.
if
we
look
at
the
discovery
response
statement
that
was
indicted
and
convicted
in
this
case,
what
was
knowingly
and
false
that
protected
this
particular
petitioner
that's
going
to
afford
such
great
protections
in
future
cases
that
come
along
before
the
u.s.
attorney's
offices
throughout
the
united
states,
and
the
answer
is,
not
much
at
all.
we
have
in
this
particular
case
the
discovery
response,
oh,
i
turned
those
over
to
the
prior
successor,
and
then
that's
litigated
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
the
documents
are
ultimately
turned
over
after
the
bankruptcy
judge
issues
an
order
to
turn
them
over.
i
think
most
people
would
be
startled
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
that
was
deemed
knowingly
false,
indictable,
charged
and
convicted.
mr.
paul
morris
but
it
shows
with
what
ease,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
morris
--well,
we're
assuming
that
for
the
sake
of
this
case,
of
course.
mr.
paul
morris
correct,
but
that
demonstrates
the
ease
with
which
those
terms
can
be
interpreted
and--
mr.
paul
morris
--yes,
but
some
of
the
cases
where
it
is
easier
to
draw
the
line,
and
if
this
court
views
this
as
one
of
those
such
cases,
adopting
the
government's
argument,
we
are
going
to
necessarily
lead
to
those
grayer
areas
which
necessarily
impact
upon
the
every
day
practice
of
law,
and
every--
mr.
paul
morris
--no,
your
honor,
my
under...
although
that
issue
was
not
briefed
and
the
government
has
never
challenged
that
the
bankruptcy
judge
is
part
of
a
court,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
bankruptcy
court
is
a
division
of
the
united
states
district
courts,
and
that...
and
it
was
never
contested
that
this
was
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
paul
morris
it's
not
that,
your
honor,
that
lawyers
are
so
sacrosanct
or
that
the
litigants
are,
or
that
we're
asking
for
an
exception
to
be
carved
out
of
1001
for
only
their
protection.
what
we're
asking
is
that
the
reading
of
1001
that's
consistent
with
congress'
intent
be
applied
to
this
statute,
and
congress
never
intended
that
every
unsworn
misrepresentation
made
in
a
federal
court
would
subject
the
person
who
makes
that
statement
to
a
1001--
mr.
paul
morris
--well,
we...
of
course--
mr.
paul
morris
--well,
we
submit
that
the
government's
contention
that
disapproving
or
limiting
bramblett
is
going
to
cause
a
change
of
conduct,
or
a
change
of
the
course
of
the
law,
whether
it's
dramatic
or
otherwise,
is
really
not
borne
out
by
what
has
happened
since
the
morgan
decision
in
1962.
in
fact,
the
interpretation
that
we
are
seeking
of
1001
in
no
way
would
constrain
the
prosecution.
in
fact,
even
the
united
states
attorneys
manual
advises
against
using
1001
in
situations
such
as
these,
where
the
statements
are
made
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
and
returning
to
the
context
argument,
the
context
of
the
word
"department",
under
this
court's
decision
in
roland,
context
is
limited
to
the
text
of
the
statute,
and
what
the
government
is
relying
upon
here
is
its
view
of
the
evolution
of
the
statute,
which
in
essence
is
another
way
of
saying
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
it
is
going
outside
of
what
congress
intended.
mr.
paul
morris
which
we
are
seeking
limitation
of--
mr.
paul
morris
--of
course,
in
order
to
be
consistent
in
our
argument.
mr.
paul
morris
my--
mr.
paul
morris
--my
distant
recollection
in
researching
the
case
was
that
california
had
a
similar
case,
a
similar
statute,
and
there
might
have
been
one
or
two
other
states,
but
i
found
no
decisions
applying
those
statutes
to
the
judicial
context.
mr.
paul
morris
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
indeed--
mr.
paul
morris
--no.
no,
your
honor,
he's
a
litigant.
mr.
paul
morris
and...
but
the
same
considerations
that
will
apply
to
the
legal
professional
will
apply
to
the
litigants,
because
it
is
the
statements
of
the
lawyers
that
are
so
often--
mr.
paul
morris
--factual
assertions
in
court.
mr.
paul
morris
correct,
but
we
can
rest
assured
that
if
the
government's
interpretation
is
adopted,
it
will
be
extended
to
misrepresentations
made
in
court--
mr.
paul
morris
--but
the
government's
reading
of
1001
is
not
limited
to
litigants.
it's
limited...
it's
not
limited
to
litigants.
it
applies
to
any
person
who
makes
any
misrepresentation
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
paul
morris
and
if
that's
a
choice
that
congress
made
in
drafting
the
statute,
then
that's
congress'
doing.
it's
not
the--
mr.
paul
morris
--and--
mr.
paul
morris
--yes,
and
we,
of
course,
are
arguing
to
the
contrary,
and
the
crux
of
our
argument
is
that
at
the
very
least,
1001
raises
an
ambiguity
as
to
its
scope,
certainly
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
"department",
and
we
request
reversal
of
the
decision
below,
based
upon
resolution
of
that
ambiguity,
in
favor
of
the
accused.
