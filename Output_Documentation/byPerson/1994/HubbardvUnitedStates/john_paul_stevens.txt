justice
john
paul
stevens
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted
of
violating
section
1001
of
the
united
states
criminal
code.
the
so
called
false
statement
statute
because
he
made
two
untoward
and
false
statements
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
the
statute
applies
the
false
statements
that
are
made
“in
any
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
any
department
or
agency”
of
the
federal
government.
the
question
then
is
whether
a
federal
bankruptcy
court
is
a
department
or
agency.
40
years
ago
in
a
case
known
as
united
states
against
bramblett,
the
court
apply
1001
do
a
false
statement
made
to
congressional
dispersing
officer.
in
that
opinion
the
court
construed
the
word
department
to
cover
all
three
branches
of
the
federal
government.
thus,
even
though
a
court
is
not
normally
considered
an
agency
or
a
department,
bramblett
indicates
that
the
court
system
has
a
whole
is
in
fact
the
department
of
the
federal
government.
over
the
past
30
years
however
the
courts
of
appeals
while
recognizing
at
the
reasoning
in
the
bramblett
opinion
treated
the
judiciary
as
a
department.
developed
a
judicial
function
exception,
this
exception
distinguishes
his
false
statements
made
in
judicial
proceedings
which
cannot
give
rise
to
criminal
liability
under
1001,
from
those
maybe
the
court
administrators
which
are
covered
by
the
statute.
in
this
case
however
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
refuse
to
follow
the
judicial
function
exception
and
held
that
bramblett
required
it
to
affirm
petitioner’s
conviction.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
the
faith
of
the
judicial
function
exception.
our
review
has
convinced
this
that
bramblett
was
incorrectly
decided.
therefore
we
are
really
presented
with
the
question
whether
we
should
overrule
that
case
and
thus
eliminating
the
needfor
any
judicial
function
exception
or
hear
to
that
decision
not
withstanding
our
conviction
that
was
incorrectly
decided.
if
we
were
to
reaffirmed
bramblett
we
would
be
require
to
repudiate
the
judicial
function
exception
because
it
is
unsupported
by
the
text
is
a
statute
as
construed
in
that
case.
because
this
is
a
sort
of
question
about
which
reasonable
judges
often
differ,
it
is
not
surprising,
that
our
conclusion
is
not
unanimous.
the
majority
of
six
justices
has
decided
overrule
a
bramblett,
but
for
different
reasons.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
that
explains
our
reasons
for
concluding
the
bramblett
was
incorrectly
decided
but
my
explanation
for
overruling
that
case
is
joined
only
by
justices
ginsburg
and
breyer.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
that
is
joined
by
justice
kennedy
and
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissent
that
is
joined
by
justices
o’conner
and
souter.
