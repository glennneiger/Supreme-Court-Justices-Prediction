mr.
richard
p.
bress
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
judicial
function
exception
to
section
1001.
the
so-called
judicial
function
exception
conflicts
with
the
plain
text
of
the
statute.
it
has
no
basis
in
the
history
of
the
statute
or
in
this
court's
decisions,
and
it
is
not
needed
to
protect
constitutional
rights
or
traditional
trial
tactics.
before
i
get
to
those
points,
however,
i
recognize
that
petitioner
now
raises
a
broader
challenge
not
raised
in
his
petition
for
certiorari.
petitioner
now
says
that
bramblett
was
incorrectly
decided
and
that
section
1001
does
not
apply
to
false
statements
made
to
the
courts.
in
bramblett,
this
court
held
squarely
that
section
1001
is
not
limited
to
false
statements
made
to
the
executive
branch,
but
that
the
term
"department"
extends
broadly
and
includes
all
three
branches
of
government.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
no,
justice
stevens,
and
primarily
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
court
expressly
declined
to
deny
on
the
nature
of
the
government
function
being
carried
out
in
bramblett.
it
was
suggested,
and
the
court
declined
to
rely
on
it.
secondly--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--in
bramblett
it
was
argued,
and
the
court
noted,
that
the
matter
involved...
and
this
is
on
page
509
of
the
opinion...
was
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
treasury
department,
and
the
misstatements
could
be
taken,
therefore,
to
be
misstatements
to
the
treasury,
because
the
money
would
come
out
of
the
treasury.
that
was
basically
a
disbursement
rationale.
in
other
words,
because
the
false
statement
would
take
money
from
the
government,
it
is
like
false
claims,
and
the
court
should
approve
it
on
that
basis.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
yes,
and
in
fact
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
as
much
in
the
poindexter
case.
the
statutory
reason
for
that
interpretation
is
that
the
original
false
statement
provision
only
went
to
false
statements
made
to
collect
payment
on
false
claims.
that
statute
was
amended,
broadened
to
include
false
statements
to
cheat,
defraud,
or
swindle
the
government.
when
this
court
in
the
cohn
decision
interpreted
that
phrase
still
only
to
reach
monetary
claims,
the
court
deleted
the
purpose
element
entirely
and
substituted
the
"in
any
matter"
clause.
that
clause
was
interpreted
later--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--congress
did.
i'm
sorry.
that
clause
was
interpreted
later
by
the
court
in
united
states
v.
gilliland
to
remove
the
restriction
to
monetary
frauds
and
to
broaden
the
statute
to
false
statements
that
might
pervert
any
authorized
government
function.
that
lack
of
a
functional
distinction
was
echoed
by
this
court
in
united
states
v.
rodgers,
where
the
court
rejected
the
notion
that
false
statements
to
an
investigatory
agency...
in
that
case,
it
was
the
fbi
and
the
secret
service...
would
not
come
within
the
scope
of
section
1001.
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
section
1001
does
not
make
functional
distinctions,
and
that
any
matter
means
any
matter.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
if
the
court
took
the
approach
of
only
applying
bramblett
to
congress,
then
the
court
would
essentially
be
overturning
the
overarching
rationale
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that
approach
we
believe
would
suffer
the
same
faults
as
overturning
the
case
in
its
entirety,
in
the
following
sense.
the
court's
special
regard
for
statutory
stare
decisis
is
based
in
part
on
congress'
ability,
if
it
does
not
like
the
holding
that
the
court
has
with
respect
to
a
statute,
to
change
the
statute
in
reaction
to
that
holding.
congress
did
not
change
or
amend
section
1001
in
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
bramblett,
and
in
the
40
years
since
bramblett
was
decided,
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
have
based
many
decisions
on
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language
in
bramblett.
for
example,
in
yermian
and
in
rodgers,
this
court
based
decisions
on
bramblett's
holding
that
the
1934
amendment
was
not
intended
to
narrow
the
scope
of
the
statute.
in
addition,
federal
prosecutors
have
for
decades
relied
on
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
statute
in
bramblett
to
prosecute
under
section
1001
false
statements
made
to
the
courts.
for
the
court
to
change
course
and
essentially--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--there's
law
out
there
that
supports
the
exception.
we
would--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--we
would
contend
that
that
law
is
not
based
on
the
text
of
the
statute,
not
based
on
any
discernible
history,
and
not
based
on
any
legitimate
policy
rationale.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
after
the
statute
was
amended
in
'34
and
in
light
of
this
court's
holding
in
gilliland,
we
do
not
agree
that
you
can
read
context
to
give
any
special
sort
of
a
notice
to
false
statements
made
in
connection
with
false
claims.
whatever
monetary
attachment
the
false
statement
provision
once
had,
it
no
longer
has.
the
context
indicating
otherwise
was
interpreted
by
this
court
in
bramblett
primarily
to
take
account
of
the
evolution
of
the
statute
over
time.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
if
the
lawyer
intentionally
misrepresents
facts,
the
lawyer
may
be
prosecutable
under
section
1001.
however,
in
a
closing
statement,
for
example,
the
lawyer
is
generally
not
taken
to
be
stating
facts
that
he
believes
exist,
but
rather
to
be
summing
up
what
has
gone
on
during
the
trial.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
it
might
be
a
proper
contextual
argument,
except
that
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
overlap
of
section
1001
on
top
of,
as
you
say,
more
specific
context...
for
example,
this
is...
the
trial
context
exists
not
only
in
the
judicial
branch
but
also
in
the
legislature
and
also
in
the
executive
branch.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that
is
my
position.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
to
be
more
specific,
section
1001
does
overlap
many
more
specific
prohibitions
and
ways
of
dealing
with
things
in
the
judicial
branch
and
outside
of
it.
in
the
judicial
branch,
it
overlaps
perjury
as
has
been
suggested.
obstruction
also
overlaps
perjury,
for
that
matter.
outside
of
the
judicial
context...
and
this
is
an
important
point,
we
believe...
section
1001
also
overlaps
perjury
there,
because
perjury
applies
to
agency
hearings
and
false
verifications.
moreover,
section
1001
overlaps
with
many
more
specific
false
statement
prohibitions
that
exist
outside
of
the
judicial
branch,
mostly
in
the
executive
branch.
if
section
1001
were
read
not
to
apply
where
a
more
specific
prohibition
applies,
you
would
cut
the
guts
out
of
the
statute,
which
was
intended
to
be
a
broad
statute.
moreover,
as
a
general
matter,
this
court
has
never
taken
the
position
that
criminal
statutes
ought
to
be
interpreted
narrowly
to
minimize
or
eliminate
areas
of
overlap.
that
would,
in
our
view,
conflict
with
the
strong
presumption
against
implied
repeal.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
firstly,
in
terms
of
the
context,
we
disagree
that
the
context
is
ambiguous,
particularly
if
you
compare
it
with
the
legislative
context.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
distinction
you
can
make--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--the
1934
amendment
to
the
act
was
passed
mostly
at
the
urging
of
the
department
of
the
interior,
which
was
concerned
about
falsifications
of
statements
made
in
connection
with
hot
oil
shipments.
those
false
statements
were
not
made
in
any
respect
to
take
money
out
of
the
federal
government.
the
amendment
to
the
statute
at
that
point,
and
i
can't
emphasize
this
too
much,
was
meant
to
take
out
the
need
to
prove
monetary
fraud,
and
rather
to
reach
false
statements
that
might
pervert
any
authorized
government
function.
to
view
otherwise
would
be
contrary
to
this
court's
decision
in
rodgers.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
the
limitation
that
you
are
looking
for,
we
believe,
would
be
provided
by
the
materiality
requirement
in
section
1001.
materiality
as
defined
by
this
court
in
kunjes,
which
itself
relied
on
the
district
of
columbia
circuit's
decision
in
wein--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well,
i
defer
to
the
court's
decision
on
that
matter,
but
i...
nonetheless,
the
point
remains
that
in
1934
congress
did
intend
to
reach
nonmonetary
fraud.
the
amendment
in
1934
completely
removed
the
need
to
prove
on
the
false
statement
was
geared
to
take
money
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
in
our
view,
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
d'amato
was
basically
a
different
way
of
saying
that
the
second
circuit
didn't
agree
with
bramblett
in
the
first
place,
because
the
second
circuit
was
essentially
saying
that
a
lie
in
a
judicial
context
is
only
going
to
fall
within
1001
if
the
lie
was
essentially
to
the
government
as
executive
on
the
other
side
of
the
case,
that
the
lie
to
the
court,
which
might
pervert
the
court's
decisionmaking
functions,
would
not
fall
within
the
statute.
we
believe
that
that
holding
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
bramblett,
and
that
perversion
of
judicial
functions,
just
as
perversion
of
executive
or
legislative,
falls
within
the
statute.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
we
believe
that
bramblett
was
correctly
decided.
the
court
in
bramblett
was
influenced
heavily
by
looking
back
at
the
legislative...
or,
the
history
of
the
statute
through
time.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i
was
trying
not
to
say,
legislative
history.
[laughter]
mr.
richard
p.
bress
if
that
were
the
only,
or
the
primary
rationale
for
the
decision
in
bramblett--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--justice
stevens,
we
take
the
holding
in
bramblett
to
be
that
section
1001
was
not
intended
to
be
restricted
to
the
executive
branch
but,
rather,
reach
the
legislative
and
judicial
branches.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
yes,
but
the
functional
distinction
that
i
believe
you
were
making
would
be
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
rodgers,
because
in
rodgers--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--but
then
i
believe
you
are
caught
by
bramblett's
other
hook,
which
is
that
the
1934
amendment
was
not
intended
to
restrict
the
false
statements
to
the
executive
branch.
bramblett
recognized
that
before
1934
the
statute
applied
to
false
statements
made
to
any
of
the
three
branches.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
yes,
and--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--what
the
court
decided
in
bramblett
was
that
congress
in
1934
intended
to
broaden
the
types
of
false
claims
that
could
be
prosecutable
without
narrowing
the
false
claims
to
any
particular
branch
of
government.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
the
court
defined
"department"
in
bramblett
to
include
all
three,
and
did
not
purport
to
make
a
distinction
based
on
the
function
that
that
department
was
then
performing.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that's
correct,
your
honor.
gilliland
made
a
point,
in
fact,
of
holding
that
in
order...
of
noting
that
in
order
to
reach
its
conclusion
it
had
to
hold
that
the
statute
was
not
limited
to
false
claims.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
yes,
only
7
years
after
the
1934
amendments,
and
notably
7
years
before
the
1948
enactment
of
the
definition
of
department
in
section
6.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
the
government
had
a
narrower
argument
than
argument
today
in
bramblett.
the
government
argued
that
the
disbursing
office
of
congress
was
an
authority
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
"agency"
in
the
statute.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
i'd
like
to
turn
now,
if
i
may,
to
the
question
or
the
issue
that
was
presented
in
this
case,
the
existence
of
the
judicial
function
exception
to
the
statute.
as
petitioner
has
conceded,
there
is
no
textual
basis
for
that
exception.
there's
no
basis
in
the
legislative
evolution
of
the
statute,
and
there's
no
basis
in
this
court's
decisions.
the
exception,
therefore,
relies
entirely
on
policy.
petitioner
says
that
a
judicial
function
exception
to
the
statute
is
necessary
to
protect
constitutional
rights,
or
traditional
trial
tactics.
the
constitution
and
this
country's
traditions,
however,
have
never
protected
a
right
knowingly
to
lie
to
the
courts.
it
is
simply
not
the
case
that
section
1001
will
impede
a
plea
of
not
guilty.
it
is...
a
plea
of
not
guilty
is
not
a
statement
of
factual
innocence.
it
is
similarly
not
the
case
that
section
1001
will
interfere
with
the
right
against
self-incrimination,
because
the
right
to
remain
silent
does
not
include
the
right
to
lie.
it
is
also
more
broadly
the
case
that
section
1001
won't
unfairly
hinder
defense
counsel.
defense
counsel
may
still
zealously
challenge
the
probity
or
sufficiency
of
the
government's
case
without
resorting
to
knowing
falsehoods.
as
this
court
held
in
nix
v.
whiteside,
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
does
not
include
the
right
to
cooperation
of
counsel
in
perjury.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i've
got
a
number
of
responses.
i
guess
first
of
all
there's
no
reason
to
confine
that
argument
to
the
judicial
branch.
people
are
represented
by
attorneys
in
front
of
the
legislature
and
certainly
in
lots
of
agency
instances,
so
that
argument
would
not
support
an
argument...
would
not
support
a
theory
that
simply
excepted
judicial
functions
in
courts.
secondly,
the
fear
here,
which
is
of
prosecutorial
overreaching,
is
not
backed
up
by
any
statistics
of
justice
department
prosecutions.
it's
purely
hypothetical.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
we
don't
believe
there's
much
reason
to
think
so,
because
obstruction
of
justice
under
1503
could
currently
be
a
basis
for
making
such
charges
against
a
lawyer
who
has
knowingly
made
false
statements
in
courts.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
other
than
perjury,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i
do
not
know.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i
don't
know--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--the
obstruction
statute
for
congress?
mr.
richard
p.
bress
in
that
statute
that
may
be
so.
we
agree
that
1505
would
cover
false
statements
made
to
congress.
i
will
note,
however,
that
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
poindexter
did
find
otherwise,
so
it's
not
completely
clear.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i
think
it
would
generally
be
the
case.
i
don't--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well,
obstruction
of
justice
includes
the
term
"corruptly",
and
so
the
question
there
would
be
whether
"corruptly"
adds
anything
to
the
term
"intentionally".
by
its
plain
language,
it
may.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
if
it's
a--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--if
it's
an
intentional
false
statement
of
fact,
it
would
be
prosecutable
under
section
1001.
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
criminal
law
has
not
grown
by
any
sort
of
neat
design,
but
in
many
cases,
and
especially
in
this
area,
more
by
accretion.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
intentional
false
statement
would
be
covered
so
long
as
it
was
material,
and
the
decision
as
to
the
breadth
of
1001,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
rodgers,
is
not
a
decision
for
this
court,
but
is
rather
a
decision
for
congress.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
it
certainly
would,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
my
argument
is
concluded.
