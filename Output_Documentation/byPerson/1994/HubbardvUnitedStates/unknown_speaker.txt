unknown
speaker
these
answers
were
verified?
unknown
speaker
none
of
these
answers
were
verified?
unknown
speaker
well,
bramblett
stands
in
your
way.
do
you
say
we
have
to
overrule
bramblett?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
certainly
has
been
followed
in
the
intervening
years,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
bramblett
decided,
though,
not
really
by
way
of
dictum,
was
that
it
was
not
limit...
1001
was
not
limited
to
the
executive
branch.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
once
you
say
it
doesn't
apply
to
the...
it's
not
limited
to
the
executive
branch
but
it
extends
to
the
legislative
branch,
it
seems
to
me
it's
very
hard
to
carve
out
of
the
statute
a
meaning
that
says,
it
covers
executive
and
legislative
but
not
judicial.
unknown
speaker
what
about
congress?
unknown
speaker
what
about
congress?
is
congress
within
that
definition?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
goes
your
plain
language
argument
out
the
window.
bramblett
held
that
it
was
applicable
to
congress,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
not
really
talking
just
about
dicta.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
certainly
no
principal
distinction
for
purposes
of
making
a
plain
language
argument.
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
to
make
a
plain
language
argument,
you
must
ask
us
to
overrule
bramblett.
unknown
speaker
do
you
attach
any--
--when
you
say--
--excuse
me.
go
ahead.
when
you
say
recede,
you
mean
overrule?
unknown
speaker
do
you
attach
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
bramblett
was
not
just
any
statement
to
congress
but
rather
was
in
support
of
a
claim
made
to
the
disbursing
office
of
the
congress?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
textual
basis,
though,
for
that
distinction.
you
agree
with
that,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's
a
nice
way
to
draw
a
line,
but
it
doesn't
reflect
anything
that's
written
in
the
statute.
isn't
that
fair
to
say?
unknown
speaker
but,
counsel,
if
similar
statements
had
been
made
before
an
alj,
for
example,
an
administrative
adjudicator,
then
you
recognize
that
that
would
certainly
be
covered?
unknown
speaker
of
an
alj
who
was
acting
inside
the
executive
branch
but
making
a
determination
as
a
trier?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
adjudicative
functions
cross
the
board--
unknown
speaker
--even
for
something
that
plainly
is
an
agency
or
department
of
government?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
you've
turned
out
to
be
the
enemy
of
plain
language.
unknown
speaker
there's
nothing
like
that
in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
you
distinguish
between
the
two...
can
you
give
any
reason
why,
if
you
have
an
adjudicative
function
exception,
it
should
apply
to
courts,
but
not
administrative
agency
adjudications?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any...
once
we
get
away
from
the
plain
language,
is
there
any
rationale
for
keeping
the
courts
out
but
keeping
the
administrative
adjudicators
in?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
exclude
congressional
adjudicative
functions?
what
would
they
be?
unknown
speaker
when
does
it
act
in
an
adjudicative
capacity?
unknown
speaker
impeachment.
what
else?
unknown
speaker
i
know
that.
when
is
that?
you
mean
when
it's
holding
hearings,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
holding
hearings
is
an
adjudicative
function?
unknown
speaker
but
your
point
is
that
it's
not
a
claim
against
the
government
in
those
situations.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i'm
trying
to
know
what
you're
carving
out
of
the
congressional
coverage
which
we
have
said
exists.
you're
carving
out
committee
hearings.
you
think
that
is
an
adjudicative
function?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
which
do
you
say?
unknown
speaker
we'll
have
to
litigate
this
in
the
future,
right--
unknown
speaker
--and
try
to
figure
out
where
this
line
goes?
unknown
speaker
there's
simply
nothing
in
the
statute,
though,
that
suggests
any
sort
of
a
judicial
function
exception
for
anything.
the
courts
who
have
reached
that
result
have
tried
to
do
it
on
the
basis
of
comparing
it
with
the
coverage
that
bramblett
actually
said
extended
to
the
legislative
function,
but
without
bramblett,
i
don't
think
there
ever
would
have
been
any
effort
to
find
a
judicial
exception.
unknown
speaker
without
bramblett
you
might
well
have
come
up
and
said
this
applies
to
the
executive
department
only,
but
you
would
never
say
there's
a
judicial
exception
that
extends
through
the
executive
department
as
well
as
excluding
legislative
and
judiciary.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
morris,
let
me
ask
you
in
this
case
whether
the
false
statements
that
were
made
in
the
course
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
could
be
punished
under
any
other
provision
of
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
the
perjury
statute
wouldn't
cover
it,
because
they
weren't
under
oath?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morris,
do
you
know
if
this
statute
has
been
applied
to
unsworn
statements
in
committee
hearings
that
turn
out
to
be
false?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morris,
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
i
understood
you
correctly.
did
you
mean
to
say
that
perjury
is
punished
less
severely
than
a
false
statement
under--
unknown
speaker
--you
said
it
the
other
way
around.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
morris.
mr.
bress,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
isn't
it
true
that
the
history
of
this
statute
was
one
of
false
claims
against
the
government,
usually
monetary
claims,
and
the
particular
false
statement
in
bramblett
was
in
support
of
a
monetary
claim
made
to
the
disbursing
officer,
so
isn't
it
conceivable
that
one
could
say
the
holding
goes
only
to
those
departments
of
the
judiciary
or
the
legislature
that
perform
similar
functions
to
the
departments
in
the
executive
branch
that
process
claims
against
the
government?
unknown
speaker
i'm
no
sure
the
opinion...
that's
a
correct
reading
of
the
opinion.
where
did...
how
do
you...
what
do
you
rely
on
for
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that...
that's
what
you
rely
on
for
saying
that
it
was...
you
think
the
rationale
would
apply
to
an
unsworn
statement
at
a
committee
hearing?
unknown
speaker
the
congress
did.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bress,
suppose
i
think
that
the
case
was...
bramblett
was
incorrectly
decided.
it
would
not
be
an
unusual
phenomenon
for
a
court
to
narrow
a
bad
prior
holding
in
such
a
way
that
you're
not
overruling
the
case,
but
you
nonetheless
do
not
follow
the
full
rationale
of
the
case.
so
why
couldn't
we
simply
say,
if
we
think
that
bramblett
was
incorrectly
decided
that
"department"
doesn't
mean
congress,
why
couldn't
we
say,
we
will
go
along
with
bramblett
insofar
as
it
has
been
applied
to
congress,
but
we
won't
take
the
further
step,
which
would
be
logical,
if
you
believe
bramblett
was
right,
of
extending
it
to
the
judiciary
as
well?
what
would
be
so
terrible
about
that?
unknown
speaker
sure,
but
i'm
saying,
i'm
under
the
impression
that's
quite
a
common
thing.
it's
how
the
common
law
courts
develop
their
law.
you
regard
the
holding
of
an
earlier
case
that
was
a
stinker
of
a
case
to
be
a
very
narrow
holding,
regardless
of
what
it
said.
what
it
held...
what
it
held
was
that
congress
is
within
the
meaning
of
"department".
it
said
that
the...
i
mean,
implied
the
judiciary
was
as
well,
but
that
was...
you
know,
we
don't
have
to
follow
that.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you're
asking
us
to
change
course
on
a
lot
of
courts
of
appeals
who
have
thought
this
was
not
really
what
was
intended
and
have
developed
this
kind
of
ironic
judicial
exception.
their
stare
decisis
argument
cuts
both
ways,
is
what
i'm
suggesting,
because
there
is
law
out
there
that
does
support
this
exception.
unknown
speaker
by
several
courts.
unknown
speaker
well,
can't
one
read
the
definition
of
"department",
which
says
it
means
the
executive
department
unless
the
context
reads
otherwise,
and
couldn't
one
say
the
context
does
indicate
otherwise
when
there's
a
monetary
claim
against
another
branch
of
the
government,
such
as
the
disbursing
officer
of
the
legislature,
or
one
of
our
disbursing
officers...
that's
a
similar
claim.
you
could
say
that
context
indicates
you
ought
to
treat
those
legislative
and
judicial
functions
as
departments
for
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
does
the
context
refer
literally
only
to
the
words
of
the
statute,
or
does
the
context
include
the
historical
understanding
behind
those
words?
for
example,
if
you
are
going
to
apply
it
to
the
judicial
branch
across
the
board,
then
i
suppose
in
theory
a
lawyer
making
a
closing
argument
who
allegedly
misrepresents
facts
is
going
to
be
indictable
under
this
statute.
would
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
say
that's
one
way...
there's
a
difference,
though,
between
a
closing
argument
and
the
reference
to
facts
there,
and
the
factual
implications
of
entering
a
plea,
which
in
fact--
unknown
speaker
--is
the
distinction
that
you
recognize.
well,
when
we
bear
in
mind
the
fact
that
historically
a
lawyer
who
is
claimed
to
have
made
a
misrepresentation
in
closing
argument
is
usually
dealt
with
by
an
objection,
a
statement
by
the
judge
saying
to
the
jury,
take
your
own
recollection
of
the
evidence,
this
is
just
argument,
you
don't
have
to
accept
his
statement
of
the
fact,
that
is
for
you
to
decide.
isn't
that
part
of
the
context
in
which
we
should
determine
whether
the
statute
in
fact
applies,
the
context
here
being
that
there
is
a
settled
practice
for
dealing
with
these
problems,
and
it
would
be
rather
startling
to
assume
that
suddenly
this
settled
practice
had
been
overlaid
by
a...
the
creation
of
an
indictable
offense.
would
that
be
a
proper
contextual
argument
as
you
are
suggesting
we
should
consider
context,
or
as
the
statute
thinks
we
should
consider
context?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
if
you
do
what
i
was
exploring,
in
fact
you
are
going
to
read
out
a
great
deal
of
the
ostensible
application
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
we
shouldn't
do
what
i
was
suggesting?
unknown
speaker
oh,
is
that
your
position?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
are
supposed
to
interpret
an
ambiguous
statute
in
the
direction
of
lenity,
and
why
isn't
it
ambiguous?
that
is
to
say,
where
the
term
"department"
means
executive
department
unless
the
context
shows
the
term
is
intended
to
describe
executive,
legislative,
or
judicial,
and
the
context
here
would
seem
ambiguous
in
respect
to
judicial,
wouldn't
it?
if
you
look
at
the
function
of
the
judiciary,
the
percentage
of
instances
in
which
people
make
statements
in
order
to
get
money
out
of
the
government
i
would
imagine
is
much
smaller
than
in
the
executive
or
the
legislative
branches.
that
is
where
the
statute
was
aimed.
but
why
isn't
it
at
least
ambiguous,
given
all
of
the
considerations
that
have
been
brought
up,
and
then
once
it's
ambiguous,
why
can't
you
say,
yes,
executive,
legislative,
but
not
judicial
because
the
context
doesn't
call
for
judicial?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
distinction
might
be
that
people
very
often
go
to
congress...
very
often...
in
order
to
get
money
from
the
united
states
government.
when
they
come
into
court,
the
instances
of
their
trying
to
get
money
from
the
united
states
government,
while
significant,
is
smaller,
significantly
smaller
than
the
instances
in
which
they're
trying
to
get
money
from
congress
or
the
executive
branch.
unknown
speaker
so
when
i
go
back
to
the
legislative
history
i
would
find
that
money
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
statute,
that
in
fact
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
to
say,
if
you
make
a
false
statement
to
the
postman,
you
say,
hey,
i
used
to
live
on
apple
street...
indictable
offense,
even
though
it's
not
under
oath,
because
now
he
may
go
to
the
wrong
place?
that's
what
congress
intended
to
do?
unknown
speaker
because
the
postman
will
go
to
the
wrong
address.
it's
material.
extra
work.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bress,
even
if
one
accepts
that
the
concern
is
making
false
statements
to
the
government,
what
about
the
distinction
that
the
second
circuit
made
in
d'amato
that
mr.
morris
brought
up
at
the
end
of
his
argument?
that
is,
at
lease
excise
civil
litigation
between
private
parties.
unlike
agency
adjudication,
where
one
of
the
parties
is
the
government,
here
we
have
no
government
interests
being
adjudicated,
only
private
parties.
why
shouldn't
that
be
taken
out?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bress,
i'd
feel
better
if
i
thought
bramblett
was
right.
can
you
persuade
me
that
bramblett
was
right,
then
i
wouldn't
have
all
these
problems?
was
it,
indeed,
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
knew
you
were
going
to
say
that.
unknown
speaker
but
in
bramblett
the
court
said
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
leave
frauds
such
as
this
without
penalty,
and
this
is
with
a
characteristic
false
claim
just
like
you
usually
make
to
the
executive
branch.
why
couldn't
one
say,
well,
bramblett
is
kind
of
shaky,
and
that
it's
certainly
sound
to
say
it
applies
to
claims
like
this
in
the
judicial
and
legislative
branch,
but
we
don't
have
to
read
it
as
expansively
as
you
suggest
and
still...
we'd
still
be
faithful
to
the
holding?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
the
primary
rationale,
but
it's
the
holding.
unknown
speaker
the
holding
is
that
congress
didn't
intend
frauds
such
as
this,
the
claim
for
money
made
to
the
disbursing
officer,
to
be
uncovered
by
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
that's
correct,
but
it
doesn't
necessary
mean
that
it
covers
everything
that
happens
in
the
judicial
and
legislative
branches.
unknown
speaker
but
rodgers
was
an
executive
department
case.
you
could
say
you
have
open
season
in
the...
across
the
executive
department.
when
you
get
out
of
the
normal
meaning
of
department,
which
is
executive,
then
it's
fraud
such
as
this
which
bramblett
decided.
unknown
speaker
but
those
were
in
support
of
false
claims
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
and
not--
unknown
speaker
--no,
but
the
broadening
could
have
covered
the
normal
meaning
of
department,
which
is
the
executive,
and
also
the
old-fashioned
meaning
for
legislative
and
judicial
frauds.
unknown
speaker
gilliland
is
not
a
false
claim
statute,
is
it?
it's
a...
gilliland
is
not
anybody
making
a
claim
against
the
government.
that's
the
hot
oil
reports.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
decided
in
1941.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
government
argued
in
bramblett
that
ultimately
the
treasury
would
disburse
these
moneys,
and
so
there
was
fraud
upon
the
executive
branch
in
any
event.
unknown
speaker
so
under
the
government's
position,
this
conduct
could
have
been
punishable
without
the
expansive
reading
that
the
supreme
court
gave
in
bramblett?
unknown
speaker
isn't
one
of
the
things
that
we
should
worry
about
is
not
what
theoretically
would
be
covered
by
this,
but
by
the
sort
of
interorum
effect
of
the
statute
if
it
is
going
to
have
the
meaning,
the
breadth
that
you
give
it?
take
my
example
a
moment
ago
of
the
lawyer
who
becomes
too
exuberant
in
final
argument.
i
suppose
the...
what
we
ought
to
worry
about
is
not
merely,
and
perhaps
not
at
all,
about
the
lawyer
who
just
flatly
lies
to
the
jury
in
a
patent
way,
but
the
lawyer
who
is
close
to
the
edge
in
a
case
against
the
government
and
then
finds
himself
next
week
being
indicted
with
6
months
of
litigation
facing
criminal
penalties
to
follow.
isn't
that
a
reason
for
trying
to
trim
the
sails,
and
isn't
the
interorum
effect
perhaps
a
better
reason
than
merely
a
solicitude
for
letting
the
judiciary
take
care
of
its
own
problems?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
because
they
don't
have
the
decision
of
this
case
as
you
want
it
handed
down
yet.
once
they
get
it,
they
may
be
a
little
bit
more
aggressive.
unknown
speaker
do
any
of
the
separate
states
have
statutes
that
specifically
punish
misrepresentations
in
judicial
proceedings?
is
there
any
state
law
jurisprudence?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
also
ask
you,
going
back
to
the
legislature...
you
cited
the
poindexter
case
as
one.
has
the
government
ever
prosecuted
anyone
other
than
admiral
poindexter
for
false
statements
in
congressional
hearings?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
because
there
must
have
been
a
lot
of
them
over
the
two
odd
ones.
[laughter]
i
think
richard
kleindienst
was
prosecuted
under
the
misdemeanor
section
of
this
statute.
of
1001.
of
course,
that
is
specifically
covered
by
18
u.s.c.
1505.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
that
statute
has
two
parts,
as
i
recall.
it
prohibits
a
misrepresentation
to
a
department,
and
then
it
has
a
specific
clause
for
congressional
committees,
which
indicates
to
me
that
"department"
does
not
include
the
congress
unless
the
statute
specifically
says
so.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
general
view
of
your
office,
that
those
false
statements
that
are
prosecutable
under
1001
in
respect
to
a
judicial
or
congressional
proceeding
must
be
such
as
they
would
support
an
obstruction
of
justice
conviction?
unknown
speaker
is
it
absolutely
the
case?
that
is
to
say,
does
it,
or
does
it
not,
do
you
think,
extend
beyond
whatever
the
scope
is
of
obstruction
of
justice?
unknown
speaker
this
may
go
well
beyond,
then,
any
kind
of
a
false
statement
at
all
made
to
a
clerk
of
a
court,
or
what
about
a
prisoner
who
writes
a
letter
about
prison
conditions,
knowing
it
will
be
attached,
though
unsworn?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the...
et
cetera.
unknown
speaker
then
a
prisoner
who
says,
after
all,
the
food
has...
you
know,
has
90,00
different
complaints,
and
some
of
them
are
not
true.
unsworn,
in
a
letter
attached
to
the...
that's
all
covered?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
prisoner
made
a
false
statement
to
the
warden?
that
would
be
covered
under
the
narrowest
reading
of
bramblett,
wouldn't
it,
part
of
the
executive
branch?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
bress.
mr.
morris,
you
have
15
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
the
consequences
to
the
losing
lawyer
are
different
in
a
civil
proceeding
than
in
a
criminal
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
lawyers
who
lose
cases
before
administrative
law
judges
in
the
executive
branches?
unknown
speaker
but
under
your
interpretation
it
would,
too,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
i
mean
we've...
lawyers
are
going
to
have
something
to
worry
about
no
matter
how
this
case
comes
out.
unknown
speaker
why
are
you
worrying
about
losing
lawyers?
i'd
be
more
worried
if
i
were
a
winning
lawyer,
winning
against
the
government.
don't
you
think
that's
the
real...
that's
the
real
worry?
unknown
speaker
he
just
doesn't
have
to
lie,
that's
all.
he
just
doesn't
have
to
lie.
unknown
speaker
the
reality
is,
it's
a
criminal
prosecution.
it's
not
a
more-likely-than-not
kind
of
problem.
you
have
to
get
a
jury
to
unanimously
decide
that
he
was
lying.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not
based
on
negligence,
it's
based
on
a
knowing
and
wilful
falsification.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
a
finding
of
fact
that
can't
be
challenged
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
petitioner
here
did
knowingly
and
intentionally
fail
to
turn
something
over.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
assume
it
because
a
jury
found
it
unanimously
in
a
criminal
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
that
it
does.
i
mean,
it
certainly
doesn't
back
up
the
point
that
you
were
making
a
moment
ago,
in
which
you
were
concerned
about
the
negligent
lawyer.
this
was
the
person
who
either
turned
or
didn't
turn
the
documents
over.
he
said
he
did.
in
fact,
he
was
found
not
to
have
done
so.
that's
a
pretty
far
cry
from
the
lawyer
that
you
were
concerned
with
in
your
hypothetical
a
moment
ago,
who
simply
has
a
client
misrepresent
something
to
him
and
is
guilty,
i
suppose,
of
nothing
more
than
negligence
if
there
isn't
time
to
check
it
out
before
the
deadline.
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
to
carve
out
the
judiciary,
then
do
you
have
a
problem
in
this
case,
because
the
bankruptcy
judge
is
not
an
article
iii
judge?
unknown
speaker
what
is
so
sacrosanct
about
lawyers?
they're
businessmen
who
all
the
time
have
to
file
responses
to
executive
branch
inquiries
about
this,
that,
or
the
other
things,
all
sorts
of
regulations,
and
if
they
are
found
wilfully
to
have
misrepresented,
they're
subject
to
1001,
so
lawyers
are
being
treated
no
differently
from
anybody
else.
why
do
we
establish
a
special
rule
for
lawyers?
unknown
speaker
although
you're
perfectly
willing
to
say
that
they
assume
that
every
unsworn
representation
made
by
any
businessman
when
he
fills
out,
you
know,
page
2003
of
some
form
that
a
federal
agency
has
sent
to
him...
that
congress
intended,
but
not
that
a
lawyer
should
be
held
to
honesty
as
well.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
self-evident
to
me,
that's
all
i
can
say.
you
must
say
that
congress
did
intend
that
the
exact
same
sort
of
representations
before
an
administrative
adjudication
in
one
of
the
agencies,
it
did
intend
the
strictures
of
this
statute
to
apply
there,
but
it
didn't
to
a
judicial
proceeding,
and
yet
the
earmarks
of
one
are
very
similar
to
the
earmarks
of
the
other.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it's
relying
on
bramblett,
which
is
a
decision
of
this
court,
a
statutory
decision.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
happen
to
know,
counsel,
if
any
of
the
separate
states
have
enacted
and
enforced
statutes
of
the
kind
that
we're
considering
here--
unknown
speaker
--particularly
against
lawyers
in
judicial
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
so
we
can
say,
based
on
that
research,
and
we
can
check
it
out,
of
course,
ourselves,
that
the
states
have
not
found
it
necessary
to
police
the
legal
profession
by
criminal
statutes
of
this
kind?
unknown
speaker
is
your
client
a
member
of
the
legal
profession?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but--
unknown
speaker
--what
we
have
here
is
not
any
statement
of
any
lawyer,
but
a
statement
of
a
litigant.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
should
we
rest
assured
that
way?
bramblett
has
been
on
the
books
for
40
years.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
true
now,
even
under
your
theory,
in
the
executive
branch.
any...
a
lawyer,
bless
their
souls,
even
if
they
come
in
and
make
misrepresentations
to
the
executive
branch,
is
held
liable
under
1001.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
bramblett
said
it
wasn't
the
choice
that
congress
made.
unknown
speaker
bramblett
said
it
goes
beyond
department.
