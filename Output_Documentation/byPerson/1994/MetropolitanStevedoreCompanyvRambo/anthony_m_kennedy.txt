--how
often
would
that
adjustment
be
made
under
the
4th
circuit
rule?
you
lose
your
job
for
six
weeks
or
eight?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
in
your
experience
there
are
say
hundreds
or
thousands
of
cases
in
which
adjustments
are
requested
because
of
economic
changes
that
the
board
never
sees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
i'm
trying
to
get
some
sense
of
is
your
experience
as
a
practitioner
and
just
how
many
of
these
claims
are
made
and
resolved
without
the
necessity
of...
or
review
by
the
board?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose,
given
your
being
in
the
9th
circuit,
i...
i
should
ask
what
the
experience
of
some
other
circuits
are.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
a
case
that
arrives
under
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
when
a
worker
is
covered
by
the
act
sustains
an
injury,
the
act
has
a
comprehensive
scheme
to
compensating
for
loss
in
wage-earning
capacity.
there
are
two
kinds
of
injuries,
one
is
an
injury
which
is
on
a
schedule
usually
for
the
loss
of
a
limb
and
the
other
is
so-called
non-scheduled
injuries,
which
is
what's
involved
here,
the
employee
injured
is
back.
he
received
an
award
because
of
the
injury
heâ€™d
lost
wage-earning
capacity.
he
then
attended
a
school
for
training
as
acrane
operator
and
for
operating
heavy
equipment,
and
he
became
a
crane
operator
and
his
earnings
capacity
is
a
result
increased,
he
increased
quite
substantially.
the
employer
sought
a
modification
of
the
award
and
cited
the
statute
but
says
an
award
can
be
modified
if
there
is
achange
in
conditions.
the
employee,
the
worker
said
changing
conditions
means
only
physical
condition
and
my
back
is
still
injured.
the
employer
said,
no,
it
means
also
a
change
in
your
wage-earning
capacity.
we
took
the
case
up
because
the
circuits
are
in
disagreement
on
this
point.
we
agree
with
the
employer
that
a
change
inconditions
under
the
statute,
he
includes
a
change
in
wage-earning
capacity.
disability
is
an
economic
concept
not
a
medical
concept.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
where
this
case
rose
and
remanded
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissent.
