mr.
thomas
j.
pierry
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please:
this
is
primarily
a
statutory
construction
case,
and
i
had
planned
on
starting
by
the
analogy
to
the
newport
news
decision
that
this
court
handed
down
33
days
ago.
but,
rather,
i'd
like
to
address
the
question
asked
by...
by
justice
stevens
as
to
how
many
cases
for
modification
have
been
filed.
and
i've
only
practiced
law
for
30
years,
but
i've
never
handled
one.
my
firm
has
handled
probably
more
claims
under
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
in
los
angeles
than
anyone
else
in
the
area.
and
i
think
there's
a
good
reason
for
it.
the
reason
that
we
don't
have
a
slew
of
claims
is
because
of
the
restrictive
reopening
process
that
was
passed
by
congress.
and
that
is,
change
in
physical
condition.
mr.
babcock
stated
that...
in
response
to
one
of
the
other
justice's
questions...
well,
that'll
get
you
in
the
door.
that's
always
been
the
problem...
getting
in
the
door.
the
fleetwood
decision
flings
open
the
door.
and
as
one
of
the
other
justices
pointed
out,
there
will
be
modifications
when
men
age
and
they're
unable
to
earn
what
they
were
earning
on
prior
situations.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry
not
in
the
1st,
5th,
9th,
or
11th
circuit.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry
we've
still--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry
interesting,
your
honor,
on
the
congressional
record,
mr.
nickles
pointed
out
that
the
1984
amendments
were
concerned
with
fraud.
and
after
going
through
at
least
a
column
about
fraud,
he
addressed
the
issue
of
requiring
the
employee
to
file,
at
least
semiannually,
wage
statements
to
avoid
the
situation
where
a
man
had
returned
to
gainful
employment
and
was
still
receiving
temporary
total
disability
benefits.
that
particular
provision,
8(j),
has
nothing
to
do
with
modification.
it
provides
for
a
forfeiture.
if
the
man
lies
about
his
earnings
or
refuses
to
give
the
information,
he
then
is
penalized
by
forfeiting
the
benefits
that
he
would
otherwise
draw
during
that
period
of
time.
and
then,
even,
the
deputy
commissioner
has
the
authority,
if
it's
prospective
in
nature,
of
arranging
some
sort
of
a...
of
a
repayment
schedule,
if
you
will,
that
does
not
jeopardize
the
man
or
his
family.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry
mandatory.
it's
mandatory
if
the
employer
requires
it.
the
employer
can
require
it
semiannually.
the
newport
news
decision
that
was
handed
down
by
this
court
just
recently,
although
it's
in
a
different
area,
precludes
the
director
from
standing
to
sue
to
file
appeals.
and,
in
effect,
precludes
her
from
being
the
champion
of
either
party
in
claims
under
the
l&h
act.
if
the
director's
opinion
is
adopted
in
this
case,
you'll
be
opening
the
back
door,
and
she
will
be
able
to
come
in,
under
section
22,
and
file
modifications
on
those
very
things
that
you
said
she
had
no
standing
to
do
in
the
newport
news
decision.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
she
has
the
standing;
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court
and
congress
intended
that
she
would
be
in
the
position
where
she
would
be
litigating
on
behalf
of
the
parties,
as
opposed
to
as
the
recent
decision
by
justice
scalia
said,
that
they...
the...
they
are
an
independent
arbiter
and
not
a
litigator.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry
the
agency
is
there
to
do
as
congress
delegated
it
to
do.
and
congress
did
not
delegate
to
it
that
function.
congress
delegated
to
it
four
items
that
justice
scalia
mentioned
in
his
recent
decision.
and
not
one
of
those
is
to
litigate
on
behalf
of
either
party.
it's
to
monitor
and
to
administer.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry
under
section
22,
the
director
is...
is
given
specific
authority
to
file
a
modification,
whereas
she
is
not
given
that
authority
as
she
is
under
the
black
lung
act,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
and
in
the
newport
news
decision,
she
had
no
standing
to
appeal
for
mr.
kerram
and
allege
permanent
total
disability
and/or
8(f)
benefits.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry
yes,
she
is.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry
it
has
provided
the
director
the
authority
to
file
a
petition
for
modification.
but,
in
my
view
of
it,
that
does
not
carry
with
it
the
right
to
litigate
the
issue
under
section
22
for
anything
save
and
except
changing
conditions,
which
has
been
uniformly
held
to
be
a
change
in
physical
condition.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry
no,
uniformly
except
in
the
1st,
5th,
9th,
and
11th
circuit.
in
every...
every
single
case
that
i've
set
forth
in
my
brief,
uniformly,
every
single
case
says
that
the
change
in
conditions
that
is
incorporated
in
section
922
has
been
held
to
be
a
change
in
physical
condition.
and
the...
the
case
i
think
that's
telling
is
the
golubiewski
case
from
maryland,
where
the
man
was
in...
incarcerated
for
murder
for
life.
and
in
that
case,
the
employer
sought
to...
to
modify.
and
they
were
held
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
modify
because
there
was
no
change
in
conditions.
clearly,
under
the
director's
view,
if...
the
same
situation...
only
now
the
convict
modifies
and
says
that
i
have
had
a
decrease
in
earnings.
and
i
think
that
points
out
the
questions
that
one
of
the
justices
asked
that...
about
what...
under
what
circumstances
other
factors
will
be
considered?
and
the
director,
if
i
may,
in
her
main
brief,
on
page
28,
states:
"the
director's
construction
will
not
overburden
the
agency
and
courts
with
modification
requests
because,
as
discussed
above,
a
change
in
wage-earning
capacity
necessary
to
support
modification
must
be
a
change
in
an
employee's
capacity
to
earn
wages
because
of
injury.
"
the
vice
of
the...
the
director's
position
is
she
leaves
out
the
causation
issue,
and
she
jumps
right
to
the
wage-earning
capacity.
whereas
the
mccormick
bright
line
test
starts
with,
"has
there
been
a
change
in
physical
condition?
"
then,
if
that
condition
precedent
is
met,
then
you've
got
your
foot
in
the
door.
then
you
go
back
in
before
the
alj
or
the...
the
benefits
review
board,
and
then
all
of
the
other
factors
can
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
change
that
would
necessitate
modifying
the
award.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
