we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
94-820,
the
metropolitan
stevedore
company
v.
john
rambo.
mr.
babcock.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
fleetwood
is
the
name
of
the
person
involved
in
the
mccormick
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
babcock.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
pierry,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
i
follow,
mr.
pierry,
your
contention
that
if
we
resolve
this
case
one
way
there
will
be
something
contrary
to
the
newport
news
decision
in
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
i
gather
you're
arguing
that
if
we
decide
this
case
in
favor
of
your
opponent,
we
will
somehow
undercut
our
recent
decision
in
the
newport
news
case.
i
don't
think
i
follow
that
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
she
is
authorized
to
file
for
a
modification?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
what
congress
has
provided.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
that
it
results
in
any
inconsistency
between
the
two
cases.
we
said
in
newport
news
congress
had
not
provided
it;
and
in
this
situation,
apparently
everybody
agrees
it
has
provided
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pierry.
mr.
babcock,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
any
of
that
possibly
the
result
of
the
declining
oil
business
in
the
gulf
or
things
like
that...
any
of
that
decrease
during
that
period
of
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
babcock.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
number
94-820
metropolitan
stevedore
co.
versus
rambo
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
