mr.
robert
e.
babcock
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
longshore
act
compensation
for
permanent
partial
disability
stops
when
economic
harm
caused
by
injury
ends
or
whether
the
benefits
must
continue
in
the
absence
of
economic
harm
until
the
worker's
physical
condition
improves
or
fully
resolves.
it's
an
exercise
in
statutory
construction.
and
the
starting
point
must
be
the
central
and,
we
think,
undebatable
fact
that
the
statute
contains
no
express
distinction
between
physical
and
other
factors
in
determining
the
conditions
which
may
serve
as
grounds
for
modification.
any
restrictions
on
modification...
this
clear,
bright
line
that
respondent
rambo
found...
finds
separating
a
worker's
physical
condition
from
all
the
other
factors
and
circumstances
to
collectively
determine
the
economic
effects
of
injury...
has
to
be
found
outside
the
statutory
language
itself.
we
say
that
it
cannot
be
found
within
the
structure
of
the
act,
the
meaning
or
the
context
within
which
the
meaning
of
the
word
must
fit.
it's
simply
not
a
concept
suited
to
a
wage
loss
system.
this
bright
line,
this
sharp
distinction,
would
provide
benefits
to
those
who
have
no
economic
loss,
and
deny
them
to
those
to
whom
that
disability...
that
economic
loss...
was
delayed.
when
congress
has
decided...
and
they
have
decided
on
several
occasions...
to
provide
benefits
in
the
absence
of
economic
loss,
they've
made
that
intention
quite
clear.
they've
used
a
schedule,
which
now
appears
at
sections
8(c)(1)
through
(20)
of
the
act...
it
has
been
there
since
its
beginning
in
1928...
or
as
they
did
in
1984,
they
amended
and
tailored
the
definition
of
disability
to
require
focus
on
impairment
in
the
case
of
certain
retiree
cases
involving
occupational
disease.
and
they
did
that
because,
in
that
instance,
the
retirement
was
thought
by
the
benefits
review
board
and
some
courts
to
have
foreclosed
the
prospect
of
economic
loss.
we
see
in
the
legislative
history
nothing
that
demonstrates
the
presence
of
an
intent
to
mark
between
physical
and
economic
factors.
and
we
certainly
see
in
the
legislative...
in...
excuse
me,
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
no
suggestion,
particularly
in
banks
and
o'keefe,
that
a
distinction
should
occur.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
the--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--the
original
determination
is
made
in
accordance
with
some
instructions
appearing
at
section
8(h)
of
the
act,
and
includes,
in
addition
to
the
physical
condition,
virtually
all
that
would
affect
either
the
stability
of
the
current
employment
or
the
prospects
and
stability
of
future
employment,
both
micro
or
personal
factors
such
as
skills
and
capacities,
and
macro
factors
such
as
the
industry
as
a
whole.
and
in
this
situation,
though,
the
source
of
this
perceived
distinction,
in
our
judgment,
lies
not
in
the
language,
not
in
the
structure,
not
in
the
history,
not
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
but,
instead,
it
lies
in
what
can
be
best
called
62-year-old
dicta,
drawn
from
a
case
in
which
the
central
question
that
we're
now
dealing
with
was
not
even
a
factor.
that
case,
mccormick,
a
1933
opinion
out
of
the
9th
circuit...
we
would
reach
the
same
conclusion
in
mccormick
regardless
of
whether
we're
following
the
fleetwood
rule,
allowing
consideration
for
modification
purposes
of
all
factors,
or
following
the
more
rigid
rule
that
the
9th
circuit
adopted,
simply
because
fleetwood
lost
his
income
because
there
was
a
depression.
he
didn't...
and
therefore
he
sought
more
compensation.
even
under
our
rule,
no
more
compensation
would
be
payable
because
the
loss...
this
additional
loss...
is
unrelated
to
the
injury
itself.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
excuse
me,
your
honor.
fleetwood
is
the
name
of
the
worker
involved
in
the
4th
circuit
case
as
to
which
the
9th
circuit's
opinion
in
this
proceeding
stands
in
contrast.
i've
forgotten
the
name
of
the
worker
in
mccormick.
another
case
relied
upon
in
rambo
and
by
petitioner
at
length
is
pillsbury.
once
again,
dicta.
and
in
both
cases
is...
there
has
been
repetition,
we
think
thoughtless
repetition,
of
those
cases
and
their
dicta
throughout
the
years,
and
we
don't
think
they
have
gained
any
greater
significance
than
they
originally
possessed
simply
because
they've
been
used
at
times
in
other
cases.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
the
benefits
review
board's
rule...
and
it's
been
approved
by,
i
think,
all
the
circuits
that
have
looked
at
it,
requires
the
parties
who
are
taking
earnings
at
a
date
subsequent
to
the
date
of
the
injury
to
prove,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
those
new
jobs
or
that
new
position
would
have
paid
at
the
time
of
injury.
there's
always
an
effort
to
bring
it
back
to
erode
the
effects
of
inflation
and
make
that
not
a
meaningful
factor.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
well,
it
would
depend
on
whether
one
were
working
from
the
9th
circuit
or
the
4th
circuit
position.
let's
presume
that
mr.
rambo
had
his
injury
after
he
had
been
trained
and
gained
the
skills
to
be
a
crane
operator
and
was
now
making
much
higher
earnings
than
the
typical
longshoremen.
if
you
took
the
9th
circuit
approach
and
a
year
passed
and
then
containers
were
replaced
by
rail
cars
or
some
other
form
of
unloading,
mr.
rambo
would
not,
even
if
his
physical...
would
not,
under
that
circumstance
in
the
absence
of
a
change
in
his
physical
condition,
gain
anything.
improvement
or
deterioration
of
physical
condition
is
always
a...
even
within
the
9th
circuit's
view...
basis
for
modification.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
yes,
it's
just
broader.
it
includes
both
the
physical
and
the
other
economic
factors
that
we
believe
should
be
included.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
i
think
that
it's
very
hard...
when
you
move
off
a
single
definition,
you
start
down
a
slippery
slope
to
find
a
place
that's
a
logical
stopping
point.
i
don't
think
that
lies
within
the
term
"conditions"
itself.
you
have
to
look
to
some
of
the
other
things
that
will
limit
the
frequency
of
the
claim.
the
prospect
of
success
is
one,
because
an
employer
who
is
unsuccessful
pays
both
his
and
the
claimant's
attorney's
fees
in
the
process.
a
claimant
who
is
unsuccessful
of
course
pays
his
own.
settlement
and
the
frequency
of
it...
90
to
95
percent
of
these
cases
settle...
is
not
a
modifiable
resolution.
i
don't
think
it'll
happen
very
often.
that's
the
best
i
can
say.
i
know
of
no
studies.
we
lived
with
this
rule
for
10
years,
since
fleetwood,
since
the
benefits
review
board
has
worked
with
it,
and
there
certainly
has
been
no
torrent
of
these
cases.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
in
the
amicus
brief
submitted
by
industrial
indemnity
insurance
company
there
was
reference
to
one
case...
i
believe
it's
name
was
vasquez...
where
an
employee
had
come
in
seeking
modification
as
a
result
of
a
loss
of
skills
and
a
loss
of
employment
and
was
awarded--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--well,
i
think
first,
in
reality,
90
percent
of
these
cases
settle
before
the
first
hearing
occurs.
and
then
you
have,
following
that,
since
'84
and
amendments
permitted
it,
some
settlements
post-hearing
and
post-award,
so
that
forecloses
that
basis
for...
for
modification.
the--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--no,
i'm
saying...
excuse
me...
i
see,
one
way
or
another,
probably
a
third
to
half
of
the
longshore
cases
on
the
west
coast,
both
shipyards
and
stevedoring
trades.
i
know
of
five
or
six
modification
cases,
including
this
one,
that
have
come
up
in
the
past
10
years.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
except
for
the
vasquez
case--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--all
that
i've...
all
that
i've
dealt
with
have
dealt
with
employer
requests,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
i...
i
would
say
virtually
none,
your
honor.
it
just
doesn't
occur.
if
you
look
through
the
last
10
years
of
the...
the
reports
of
the
administrative
law
judge
opinions
that
are
collected
in
the
matthew
bender
publication
of
it,
it
s
a
minuscule
number
of
cases
involving
the
issue.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
well,
i'm
speaking
nationally:
the
9th
circuit,
of
course...
those
of
us
within
it...
lived
under
the
benefits
review
board
rule
until
the
9th
circuit
issued
its
opinion
in
this
case,
striking
the
board's
rule
down.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
there
are.
and...
and
i
did
my
best
to
try
to
gather
them.
it's
kind
of
hard
to
find
sometimes
what
states
do,
because
they're
done
in
an
informal
basis.
we
were
able
to
identify
about...
if
i
may
pull
my
note
for
a
second,
your
honor...
13
states
that
have
taken
very
similar
language,
"condition"
or
"conditions",
and
have
judicially
determined
that
to
encompass
the
economic
and
the
physical.
six
have
gone
the
other
way,
taking
those
same
terms
and
said
it's
limited
to
the
physical.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
i
don't
think
i
could
do
that,
your
honor,
without
looking
at
the
states.
i
didn't
see
a...
a
geographic
pattern.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
right.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
that's
right.
it's
about
2
to
1,
with
the
majority
favoring
the
fleetwood,
more
open
interpretation
of
the
language.
and
about
15
more
have
just
been
more
precise
in
their
legislative
direction,
sometimes
saying
you
must
include
economic
factors,
sometimes
saying
you
may
include
only
physical
factors.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
i
think
it
will
get
you
in
the
door
to
a
proceeding,
seeking
modification.
and
if
you
can
persuade
the
administrative
law
judge
that
this
blip,
this...
this
hiccup
in
the
economy,
demonstrates
a
permanent
change
in
the
worker's
capacity
to
earn,
one
which
is
likely
to
continue,
as
section
8(h)
required,
into
the
foreseeable
future,
then
you
will
see
an
increase
in
the
average
weekly...
in
the
wage-earning
capacity.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
well,
that's
right.
and...
and
so
the
response
of
any
claimant
in
that
situation
is,
even
if
you've
got
this
number...
he's
going...
you
know,
that...
that
it
increased
and
it's
permanent,
he's
going
to
turn
and
say,
i...
i
would
think,
but
this
isn't
in
the
interest
of
justice...
which
is
your
overall
equitable
limitation
on
it
and
certainly
one
the
congress
accepted...
it
isn't
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
take
away
some
of
my
money
because
i
would
have
been
there
anyway
and
i
would
be
successful.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
i
think
that
they
encompass
the
availability
and
suitability
of
employment.
i
think
they
encompass
the
industry
and
its
condition,
all
of
the
factors
that
we
deal
with
now.
as
an
example,
your
honor,
when
an
individual
has
been
injured
and
gone
back
to
work
in
the
shipyard...
which
is
probably
the
best
example
that
we
deal
with...
we
the
debate
always
is,
does
his...
do
his
earnings
that
he
has
received
within
the
shipyard
reasonably
reflect
what
he's
likely
to
earn
in
the
future?
and
there's
always
a
question
about
how
long
is
this
shipyard
going
to
continue,
given
the
state
of
our
nation's--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--well,
it--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--if
i
may
take
them
one
at
a
time.
the...
the
depression
situation...
earning...
earnings
are
down.
you
could
say
earning
capacity
is
down
if
it's
a
long-term
depression.
but
the
amount
of
increased
benefits
that
the
individual
would
otherwise
receive
are
unavailable
to
him
because
there's
no
relationship
between
the
injury
and
that
job.
the
injury
still
has
to
play
a
role
at
all
steps
in
this
process.
because
we
only
will
compensate
for
impaired
earning
capacity
attributable
to
the
injury.
old
age...
first,
i'd
say
that
may
be
just
as
physical
a
condition
as
any
of
the
others,
and
is
a
problem,
if...
if
it
exists,
exists
under
either
of
the
definitions.
but,
generally,
we
would
argue
that's
an
intervening--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--all
of
those
things
are
taken
into
account,
both
in
the
original
determination
and
have
to
be
taken
into
account
in
the
assessment
of
whether
a
modification
is
appropriate;
that's
correct.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
well,
first,
we
cannot
see
within
the
act
or
its
structure...
structure
justice
when
an
individual
who
no
longer
has
an
economic
loss
continuing
to
receive
benefits--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
characterization
of
a
workers'
compensation
scheme.
it
was
the
characterization
followed
in...
i'll
mispronounce
it
too...
but
the
golubiewski
case
that
dealt
with
the
imprisonment.
the
idea
that
really
what
we're
doing
here
is
having
periodic
payments
of
a
lump
sum
award.
that
was
the
concept
that
the
judge
followed
there.
and
so
he
felt
that
you
wouldn't
cut
it
off
at
any
later
time
because
it's
been
secure
and
determined.
the
longshore
system
is
designed
to
be
flexible.
it's
designed
to
replace
only
economic
loss.
this
isn't
just
a
replacement
for
a
tort
system;
it
has
a
variety
of
rehabilitation
purposes.
it
has
the
compensation
purpose
in
itself.
it's
got
a
medical
insurance
program
that
goes
along
with
it.
i
don't
think
you
can
characterize
the
bargain
that
was
struck
with
congress
in
the
middle
and
the
employers
and
employees
on
both
sides
as
simply
a
replacement
for
a
tort
system.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
i
think
it's
a
substitute.
i
don't
think
it
was
designed
simply
to
supplant...
workers'
comp
in
general
is
to
avoid
that
kind
of
litigation,
but
it
carries
with
it
other
benefits,
and
with
those
other
considerations
that
go
along--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
well,
i
think...
in
theory,
you
would
say
that
a
scheduled
award,
because
its
focus
is
solely
for
impairment
of
the
worker...
20
percent
lost
function
of
an
arm...
if
somehow
that
improved
and
the
award
had
not
been
fully
paid
out
by
the
time
this
all
occurred,
that
you
would
seek
modification
based
on
change
of
physical
condition.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
yes,
because
that's
the
basis
for
the
award.
i
think
a
couple
of
points
about
them
and
how
long
and
why
there
isn't
an
overburden...
and
you
can
go
back
to
'81,
and
the...
and
the
5th
circuit's
opinion,
hole
v.
miami
shipyard,
where
fleetwood
is
presaged,
by
saying
we're
going
to
give
a
1
percent
de
minimis,
as
many
of
the
judges
did
and
the
5th
circuit
approved,
in
order
to
avoid
the
running
of
what
was
seen
as
a
sometimes
harsh
statute
of
limitations.
and
they
provided
this
1
percent
award
because
the
economic
effects
might
materialize
later
on.
so
we
have
maybe
15
years
of
experience
with
it.
and
the
averages...
i
just
checked...
the
number
of
cases...
new
cases...
filed
under
the
longshore
act
dropped
from
4,500
in
1984,
when
fleetwood
came
out,
to
the
average
of
3,500
to
3,700
in
the
intervening
decade.
there
has
been,
and
i
think
that
padding
shows,
that
there
will
not
be
any
torrent
of
increased
litigation
as
a
