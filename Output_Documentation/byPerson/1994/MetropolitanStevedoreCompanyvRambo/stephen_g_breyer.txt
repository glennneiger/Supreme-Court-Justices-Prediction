g.

what...
what
do
you
think
the
conditions
are,
other
than
the
physical?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so,
well,
then
i
was
just
interested...
you
said
the
lack
of
jobs
in
the
depression
wouldn't
be
a
relevant
factor.
why
not?
well,
what
about
inflation
or
just
old
age?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
you
get
older,
it's
harder,
if
you're
handicapped,
to...
to
make
more
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
having
trouble
is
finding
that...
that
a
person,
say,
has...
his
arm
doesn't...
is...
is
handicapped,
and
so
they
say,
here
in
1952,
that's
worth
$80
a
week,
because
you
can't
hold
these
jobs.
and
now,
in
1992,
of
course,
$80
is
almost
nothing,
and
it
would
be
worth
a
lot
more.
so
that's
inflation.
his
injury
is
now
causing
him
to
lose
a
lot
more
money.
or
he's
now
70
years
old
and...
or
60
years
old,
and
it's
much
harder
for
a
60-year-old
person
without
an
arm
to
find
a
job
than
for
a
30-year-old
person
without
an
arm,
quite
likely.
and...
and
so
what...
do
you
take
all
those
things
into
account?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
the
obvious
one
is
inflation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
obvious
one
is
inflation.
why
weren't
all
the
workers
coming
in
and
saying,
in
the
mid-seventies,
late-seventies,
you
know,
this
is
worth
nothing
now
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
weren't
they
all
in
and
saying,
hey,
first
of
all,
inflation,
and...
and
second...
well,
i
mean
inflation
is
the
obvious
one
and
i...
i'm
sure
there...
there
are
a
lot
of
others
where...
where...
why
wouldn't
they
just...
they
get
older...
that's
the
other
obvious
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
is
harder
to
find
a
job
when
you're
older.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you
think
that
we're
accurately
in...
in
the...
in
the
early
seventies,
people
really
predicted
the
arab
oil
embargo
and
everything?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
but
so
what?
i
mean,
why
is
that
bad?
if
she
has
the
standing,
she
has
the
standing.
in
the
4th
circuit,
what
has
happened?
has
there
been
a
big--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
if...
what
i'm
actually
driving
at
is,
is...
is
it
a
bad
thing
to...
why
is
it
a
bad
thing,
if
the
language
allows
it,
to
let
the
agency
work
out
a
set
of
rules,
over
time,
even
if
nobody
has
thought
of
it
before,
whereby
they
will...
when
there
are
changes,
the
worker...
usually
it'll
probably
work
in
favor
of
the
worker...
i
mean
the
inflation
will
go
up
or
there's
an
economic
change
nobody
thought
of
and
he
has
a
harder
time
getting
a
job
as
he
gets
older...
isn't
that
what
the
agency
is
there
for,
to
work
all
these
things
out?
