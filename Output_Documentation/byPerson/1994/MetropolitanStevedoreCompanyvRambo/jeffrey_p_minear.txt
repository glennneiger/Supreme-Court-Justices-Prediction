mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
director
submits
that
metropolitan
may
seek
modification
of
rambo's
disability
award
based
on
his
acquisition
of
new
job
skills
that
have
restored
his
wage-earning
capacity.
the
statutory
language
here
provides
some...
some
very
useful
guidance.
section
22
allows
modification
based
on
a
change
in
conditions.
congress'
use
of
the
plural
term
22
is
not
limited
to
a
change
in
the
claimant's
physical
condition.
if
congress
had
intended
that
result
it
easily
could
have
said
so.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
board
did
not
take
a
position
on
this
issue.
oh,
excuse
me,
the
board.
the
director...
the
director,
who
we
represent,
has
not
taken
a
position
on
this
issue
until
the
fleet...
after
the
fleetwood
case.
the
board's
original
position...
at
least
in
1984...
it
claimed
that
it
was
overruling
its
prior
rulings.
the
only...
only
ruling,
though,
it
cited
was
a
case
called
rizzi.
and
rizzi
did
not
involve
a...
a
case
such
as
we
have
here,
where
there's
been
an
acquisition
of
new
job
skills.
instead,
rizzi
involved
a
situation
where
the
individual
had
in
fact
suffered
degeneration
unrelated
to
his
injury.
and
the
court
had
said
that
that
was
not
compensable
and...
and
apparently
believed
that
because
it
was
not
a
physical
injury.
so,
in
other
words,
i
think
the...
the
short
answer
to
this
is
that
the
board
at
least
thought
it
had
that
position
in
1974.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
thought
it
had
the
position
of
being
limited
to
a
physical
condition--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
the
fact
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
i
think
there
were
various
manifest...
manifestations
along
the
way,
although
no
clear
holdings.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
one
clear
holding
would
have
been
in
1972,
when
the
assistant
secretary
for
labor
indicated
that
if
a
worker
failed...
indicated
in
congressional
oversight
hearings...
that
if
a
worker
failed
to...
to
accept
rehabilitation
opportunities,
his
award
could
be
requced
on
that
basis.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
don't
think
it
was
unequivocally
manifested
until
1984.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
no
clear
indication
in
the
other
direction
as
well.
most
of
those
statements
that
we
find
in
the...
in
the
various
court
cases
are
all
dicta.
and
in
fact
they
have
not
squarely
addressed
the
issue.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i...
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
so.
and...
and
there
are
several
reasons
for
that.
first
of
all,
the
retraining
opportunities
were
far
less
back
in
the
1930's
and
the
1940's
as
compared
to...
to
today,
when
there
are
more
opportunities
for
retraining
and
rehabilitation.
the
common
practice,
as
i
understand
it,
during
the
thirties
and
forties
if
an
in...
if
a
worker
was
injured
was
that
he
would
be
put
in
a
light-duty
program.
he'd
receive
compensation
based
on
his
decreased
wages.
and
his
situation
would
not
change
very
much.
but
now,
because
there
are
more
opportunities
on
the
waterfront,
in
fact,
for
white
collar
jobs,
for
jobs
such
as
mr.
rambo
has,
of
operating
a
crane--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
yes,
it
would
also
apply
in
that
situation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
another
difficulty
is
that
in
fact,
in
those
cases
where
the
people
leave
the
industry,
the
employer
may
not
know
what
their
current
earnings
are.
congress
actually
dealt
with
that
issue
in
1984
by
enacting
8(j)
of
the
longshore
act,
which
allows
an
employer
to
require
a
disabled
employee
to
submit
wage
statements
so
that
the
employer
can
keep
track
of
what
the
disabled
worker's
wages
are.
the
obvious
reason
for
that
was
base...
was
the
assumption
that
there
would
be
a
basis
for
modification
of
awards
based
on
the
increased
earnings.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
excuse
me?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
inflation...
excuse
me,
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--to
answer
your
question,
the
longshore
act
does
take
into
account
inflation
in
section
10,
in
the
case
of
total
disability,
but
not
in
the
case
of
permanent
partial
disability.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
under
our
construction,
those
types
of
considerations
are
not
relevant
changes
in
conditions.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
reason
why
is
because
those
factors
are
considered
in
the
initial
benefits
award.
a
determination
is
made
in
terms
of
what
the
person's
future
wages
might
be.
now,
if
there
is
a
mistake--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--now,
if
there
was
a
change
there,
that
would
arise
under
a
mistake
of
fact
rather
than
a
change
in
conditions,
to
the
extent
that
that
factor
is
considered,
in
the
initial
benefits
determination.
and
as
this
court
indicated
in
o'keefe,
there's
no
limitation
to
the
types
of
facts
that
could
be
considered
in
a
particular
case.
so
we
think
that
the...
the
same
rule
should
apply
to
change
in
conditions.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
the
director
generally
doesn't.
and
this
is
on
the
basis
of
mccormick
and...
and
burley.
mccormick,
you
recall,
was
a
case
involving
a...
the
depression,
and
the
benefits...
well,
actually
the
court
at
that
point
held...
the
court
of
appeals...
held
that
you
do
not
take
into
account
change...
economic
changes
of
that
type
in
adjusting
an
award.
burley
was
a
case
that
involved
an
increase
in
work
available
to
a
disabled
worker
during
world
war
ii,
because
of
the
booming
economy.
the
same
result
there.
that
is
not
a
relevant
condition.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
new
skills,
a
change
in
physical
condition.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
elimination
of
a
particular
job
because
it's
obsolete,
for
instance.
suppose
that
the
award
was
based
on
the
understanding
that
this
person
could
perform
a
job
that
is
no
longer
available
anywhere
in
the
economy
because
of...
changes
have
made
his
remaining
skills
obsolete.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
there's
one--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
the
difference
there
is
he
had
a
particular
skill
that
was
taken
into
account
at
that...
at
that
time.
i
think
there's
a
more
important
point,
though,
that
ought
not
to
be
lost.
and
that
is
that
section--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--excuse
me.
section
22
also
applies
to
modification
of
death
benefits.
and
death
benefits
are...
may...
are
awarded
without
regard
to
the
claimant's
physical
condition.
section
22
has
to
apply
to
that
situation.
it
clearly
applies
to
the
situation
where
there's
a
remarriage
or
a
termination
of
benefits.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
oh,
that's...
that's
a
separate
concern,
again,
whether
or
not
there
is
state
compensation.
but
under
section
909
or
section
9
of
the...
the
longshore
act,
it's
quite
clear
that
there
are
certain
changes
that
can
take
place
with
regard
to
death
benefits,
such
as
remarriage,
such
as
the
termination
of
a
minor
child's
dependency.
section
22
serves
the
function
of
allowing
changes
with
regard
to
those
changes
as
well.
and
there's
no
question
that
it
has
been
applied
for
many
years
with
regard
to
those
types
of
changes.
section
22
cannot
mean
one
thing
with
regard
to
disability
awards
and
another
thing
with
regard
to
death
benefit
awards.
the
real
problem
that
i
think
is
troubling
you,
justice
souter,
is
the
question
of--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--what
are
the
considerations--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--an
acquisition
of
a
new
skill
is
something
that
is
a
relevant
change
in
conditions.
again,
our
focus--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--because
he
was
assumed
to
have
had
only
limited
skills.
he
developed
new
skills.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
or...
or
could
have
been
considered
as
well.
any
of
those
factors...
our
basic
position
is
any
factor
that
was
considered
in
the
initial
benefits
award
could
be
considered
based
on
a
modification,
either
based
on
a
mistake
of
fact
or
a
change
of
conditions.
but
some
of
these
changes
are
simply
not
relevant.
for
instance,
economic
changes
are
generally
not
relevant
because
wage
capacity
is...
is
determined
on
the
basis
of
what
is
described
by
the
alj
here
as
normal
employment
conditions.
now,
if
the
worker
can
come
in
and
show
that
in
fact
there
was
a
mistake
made
with
regard
to
what
was
normal
employment
conditions
in
the
initial
hearing,
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
modification.
but
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
modification--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
he
could
certainly
say
that,
but
he
would
have
to
prove
here...
the...
the
problem
here
is
if
you
move
for
modification
you're
going
to
have
to
prove
the
basis
for
your
modification.
and
that...
the
focus
in
the...
in
the
modification
hearing
is
going
to
be,
well,
what...
what
are
your
current
earnings
now?
do
they
accurately
reflect
your
wage-earning
capacity?
and,
if
not,
what
other
factors
should
be
considered?
thank
you,
your
honor.
