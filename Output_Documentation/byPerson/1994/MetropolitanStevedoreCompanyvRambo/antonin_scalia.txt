do
we...
do
we
adjust
conditions
for
inflation?
i
mean,
when
you
figure
out
whether
conditions
have
changed,
do
you
use
the
dollar
amount
he
was
earning
or...
or...
to
adjust
that
up
or
what?
justice

and
what
if
his
condition
gets
worse?
if
his
physical
condition

for
him?

you
include...
i
gather...
what
if
there's
just
a...
just
a...
a
particularly
good
couple
of
years
for
the
industry,
so
that
all
the
wages
in
the
industry
are
higher;
is
that
one
of
those
conditions?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that...
but
that's
an
increase
that
would
have
happened
anyway.
i
mean,
you
know,
injury
or
no
injury,
he...
he
should
get
the
benefit
of
that
blip.
he...
he
would
still
have
been
in
that
industry.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
do
you
draw
the
line--
--yes,
why
is
that
different
from
the
things
you
say
aren't
included?
yes.
how...
what's
your
criterion?
