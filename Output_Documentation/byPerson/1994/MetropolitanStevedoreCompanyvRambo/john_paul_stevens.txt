of
course,
fleetwood
is
a
case
where
the
employer
got
the
modification,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
there
similar
cases
where
the
employee
has
gotten
modification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just...
just
one
case...
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
is
a
lot...
there
would
be
a
lot
of
possibilities
for
claims
by
employees
that...
say
the
job
had
been
abolished
or
something
like
that...
the
example
you
gave...
but
why
do
you
suppose
there
aren't
more
of
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
all
those
requests
by
the
employer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
one
you
knew
about,
though?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
question,
mr.
minear?
at
the
time
that
the
fleetwood
case
was
decided
back
in
'86,
there
was
some
discussion
in
the
opinion
about
what
the
board's
position
was.
is
the
board's
position
today
the
same
as
it
has
always
been?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
thought
it
had
which
position
in
'74?
justice
john
paul
stevens
physical
only.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
when...
when
did
the...
either
the
director
or
the
board
first
manifest
the
position
that
it's
not
limited
to
physical
injury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
is
the
first
clear
indication
of
what
their...
their
position
was,
it
was
not
limited
to
physical
holding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
apart
from
testimony
in
here,
when
in
any...
any
actual...
controversy...
you
know,
any...
any...
any
actual
case...
when
did
either
the
director
or
the
board
first
manifest
the
position
unequivocally
that
you
now
espouse?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
the
thing
that
puzzles
me...
just
to
get
it
on
the
table...
it
seems
to
me
if
the...
if
the...
if
that
rule
is
correct,
there
would
have
been
a
lot
of
cases.
because
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
why
you
could
have
changed
conditions
both
ways,
and
yet
there
don't
seem
to
be
many.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
wouldn't...
wouldn't
your
principle
apply
if
he
got
a
job
as
a
travelling
salesman
and
doubled
his
income?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
i
mean,
there
must
be
lots
of
these
people
who
have
been
able
to
improve
their
earning
capacity
for
reasons
unrelated
to
their
injury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
that
could
be
because
it
covers
mistakes
as
well
as
change
in
condition.
that
might
explain
why
it
applies
to
death
benefits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
fleetwood
flung
open
the
door
about
10
years
ago,
and
we
haven't
been
flooded
with
cases--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
that's
just
in
the...
in
the
4th
circuit,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
uniformly
except
in
the
4th
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'll
presume
that.
but
isn't
it
true
that
this
whole
statutory
scheme
is
a
replacement
of
the
tort
liability
scheme
in
which,
if
they'd
been
injured,
you
got
a
recovery,
and
later
on,
when
he
recovers
completely,
he
still
keeps
whatever
he
got
in
the
tort
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
did...
did
away
with
having
to
prove
fault.
you
had
strict
liability.
and
you
get
lesser
damages,
but
you're
sure
what
they're
going
to
be.
it
certainly
is
a
substitute
for--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
we're
only
talking
about
nonscheduled
awards,
aren't
we,
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
scheduled
awards
go
on
whatever
happens?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
the
non...
what
i'm
saying...
in
the
non...
in
the
scheduled
award,
it
would
have
to
be
a
change
of
physical
condition;
you
would
agree
with
that?
