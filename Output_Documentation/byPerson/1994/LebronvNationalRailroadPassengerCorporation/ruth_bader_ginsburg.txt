mr.
cole,
are
you
saying
this
is
in
effect
a
centaur-like
entity,
that
it
is
part
government
and
part
not
government,
it
depends
on
which
purpose--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
about
for
sovereign
immunity
purposes?
it
would
not
be
immune--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cole,
is
there
any
other
case...
i'm
not
aware
of
one...
where
you
have
an
agency
of
this
unique
character?
that
is,
for
some
purposes
it's
treated
like
a
government
agency.
for
foia
purposes,
it's
treated
like
a
government
agency.
for
the
inspector
generals
act,
it's
treated
like
a
government
agency.
for
apa
purposes,
it
isn't.
in
burton,
you
have
a
private
actor,
private
restaurant
owner
in
a
state
building.
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
has
a
unit
that
is
in
some
respects
governmental,
in
some
respects
not.
is
there
any
other
such
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
there
been
any
cases
where
such
an
agency,
where
its
status
as
a
federal
actor,
state
actor
has
been
challenged
successfully?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
fdic
was
distinguished
as
an
entity.
it
didn't
have
as
many
characteristics
that
arguably
could
qualify
it
as
private,
as
amtrak
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
baine,
was
there
some
legislative
change
regarding
amtrak
after
the
date
of
the
conrail
decision
to
which
you
referred?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
change?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
what
respects
were
they
changed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
case,
it
would
be
a
stronger--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--stronger
case
after
the
conrail
decision
than
before,
because
of
those
legislative
changes.
they
tended
in
favor
of
the
finding
of
governmental
color
to
this
entity,
not
against
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
baine,
it's
easy
to
concede
this
is
not
a
government
agency
for
the
federal
tort
claims
act
purposes,
it
is
not
a
government
agency
for
purposes
of
apa
purposes,
but
where
is
there
a
concession
that
this
is
not
a
government
actor
for
purposes
of
constitutional
limitations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you--
--mr.
baine--
--would
you
agree
with
the
characterization
i
suggested
before
that
this
is
a
centaur-like
entity,
that
it
is
part
private,
part
government?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
take
a
case
without
any
regulation.
suppose
amtrak
says,
we
don't
want
any
leafleting
in
penn
station,
and
that's
challenged
as
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
and
this
court's
decision
involving
the
port
authority
terminal
is
cited
by
the
plaintiffs
as
precedent,
could
amtrak
have
a
policy
that
says,
no
leafleting
on
these
premises?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--don't
you
see
some
difference
between
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
transportation
as
the
government's
person
on
this
board
and
a
judge
appointed
under
article
iii,
in
terms
of
affiliation
with
the
government?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
president
is
the
master
of
the
secretary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you...
can
you
give
an
example
of
another
private
entity
that
is
subject
to
the
foia
and
to
the
inspector
generals
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
foia
doesn't
apply
to
the
private
sector,
does
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
recognize
that
in
some
respects
this
was
a
public
and
not
a
private
corporation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
least
for
that
respect--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
purposes
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
for
purposes...
and
also
under
the
inspector
generals
act,
do
you
know
any
private
entity
that
is
subject
to
that
legislation?
