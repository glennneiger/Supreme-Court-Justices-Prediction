mr.
david
d.
cole
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
asks
whether
amtrak
was
subject
to
the
constraints
of
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
when
it
refused
to
display
michael
lebron's
advertisement
in
pennsylvania
station,
new
york,
because
of
its
political
content.
if
amtrak
is
correct
that
it
is
a
private
actor,
then
an
entity
wholly
owned
by
the
united
states,
managed
by
the
u.s.
appointed
board,
dependent
on
massive
united
states
subsidies
for
its
very
survival,
would
be
constitutionally
free
to
engage
in
blatant
viewpoint
discrimination.
mr.
david
d.
cole
that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the...
amtrak's
argument
is
that
no
matter
what
its
speech
policies
are,
they
are
not
subject
to
constitutional
review
because
they
are
not
a
state
actor.
mr.
david
d.
cole
that
would
be
decided
by
the
first
circuit...
i
mean,
by
the
second
circuit
on
remand.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
we
didn't
waive
any
claim,
your
honor.
this
court
held
in
yee
that
one
waives
claims,
not
arguments.
the
claims
that
we
have
made
from
the
outset
are
that
mr.
lebron's
first
and
fifth
amendment
rights
were
violated
because
amtrak
is
a
federal
actor.
we
argued
that
amtrak
was
a
federal
actor
because
it
is
owned
and
controlled
by
the
united
states,
the
very
argument
that
we
are
making
here
today.
in
the--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--in
the
lower
courts,
the
second
circuit
had
held
that
amtrak
was
not
a
governmental
entity
for
various
purposes.
we
did
not
contend
that
amtrak
was
a
governmental
entity
as
such
for
statutory
purposes,
et
cetera,
but
what
we
did
argue--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--no.
no,
for--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--no.
mr.
david
d.
cole
for
statutory
purposes,
we
believe
that
whatever
congress
labels,
amtrak
decides
what
statutory
consequences
apply
to
amtrak,
and
that,
and
the
fact
that
congress
said
that
amtrak
is
not
an
agency
establishment
or
a
department
of
the
united
states
means
like
certain
laws
like
the
apa,
et
cetera,
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
would
not
apply.
however,
we
have
always
maintained
that
because
this
entity
is
owned
and
controlled
by
the
united
states,
it
must
be
subject
to
the
constitutional
constraints
that
apply
where
the
government
is
responsible
for
a
particular
action.
mr.
david
d.
cole
no,
as
long...
we
believe
that
the
question
under
the
state
action
analysis
is,
is
the
government
responsible
for
the
conduct
that
is
being
challenged?
we
believe
that
when
you
look
at
the
facts
of
amtrak,
its
ownership
and
control
by
the
united
states,
the
board,
the
funding,
et
cetera,
it
is...
the
government
is
responsible
for
this
conduct,
for
the
policy
that
we
have
challenged
here.
however,
whether
you
call
it
private
or
public
is
in
some
way
just
a
label.
the
question--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
amtrak
is
a...
for
constitutional
purposes
it
must
be
subject...
it
is
a
government
actor.
mr.
david
d.
cole
for
sovereign
immunity
purposes
it's
not
immune
because
congress
established...
gave
it
the
right
to
sue
and
be
sued,
and
therefore
it's
not
immune
under
the
sovereign
immunity
principles,
and
there
are
various...
the
question
of
whether
an
entity
is
an
agency
determines
various
statutory
things,
like
whether
the
apa
applies,
whether
the
federal
tort
claims
act
applies,
whether
procurement
laws
apply,
whether
financial
accounting
laws
apply...
those
are
statutory
questions
to
which
congress'
label
is
obviously
a
very
central
question.
the
question
before
this
court,
however,
is,
should
this
entity
be
constitutionally
responsible
when
it
denies
advertising
in
penn
station
on--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--we
say
that
for
the
question
of
state
action,
for
the
question
of
governmental
responsibility--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
that's
correct.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
we--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
i
think...
i
think,
two
points
in
response
to
that,
justice
scalia.
first,
the
question
of
whether
amtrak
is
constitutionally
responsible
for
the
conduct
challenged
here
cannot
turn
on
whether
amtrak
is
constitutionally
composed.
we
don't
argue
that
it's
not
constitutionally
composed.
mr.
david
d.
cole
second
of
all,
we
do
believe
that
it
is
constitutionally
composed
because
the
directors
of
amtrak
are
appointed
either
by
the
president
or
by
the
secretary
of
transportation
and
would
be
inferior
officers
under
the
appointments
clause.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
the
congress
has
deemed
that
they
shall
be
appointed
by
the
secretary
of
transportation.
they--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i
think
the
central
point,
your
honor,
is
that
whether
amtrak
is
constitutionally
responsible
for
its
actions
in
this
case
does
not
turn
on
whether
its
board
is
constitutionally
composed.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
we
believe
that
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
the
officers
were
inferior
officers,
it
would
be
permissibly
composed,
because
the
executive
department,
through
the
president
or
the
secretary
of
transportation,
appointed--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
no--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
no,
in
fact
the
united
states
owns
all
of
amtrak's
preferred
shares
and
has
99
percent
of
the
votes,
so
the
united
states,
as
essentially
the
sole
shareholder
of
amtrak,
has
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
what
amtrak
does.
in
addition,
the
united
states
appoints
the
entire
membership
of
the
board,
so--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
that's
right,
and
they
are--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--that's
right,
and
no--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i'm...
we're
not
taking
a
position,
your
honor,
on
whether
the
board
is
constitutionally
composed
or
not.
what
we
believe
is
that
that
question
is
a
separate
question
from
whether
it
ought
to
be
constitutionally
accountable,
and
certainly--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--the
directors
are
appointed
to
a
range
of
fixed
terms.
some,
i
think,
are
appointed
to
2-year
terms,
some
to
longer
terms.
mr.
david
d.
cole
the
statute
is
silent
as
to
removal,
and
so
the
removal
power
would
presumably
be
implied
under
the
case
law.
amtrak
is
not
only
owned
by
the
united
states,
its
board
is
not
only
appointed
by
the
united
states,
it
would
not
be
here
were
it
not
for
massive
federal
subsidies
that
congress
has
provided
through
the
years.
today,
its
subsidy
is
about
1
billion
dollars
a
year.
that's
half
of
what
the
state
department
gets.
it's
six
times
what
the
united
states
postal
service
got
in
1994.
its
property,
valued
at
3.4
billion
dollars,
including
penn
station,
was
all
purchased
by
the
united
states
with
tax
dollars.
it
is
subject
to
governmental
obligations,
obligations
that
no
private
entities
are
subject
to...
the
inspector
general
act,
the
government
and
sunshine
act,
the
foia.
congress
micromanages
amtrak.
it
sets
goals
for
its
on-time
performance,
for
how
fast
the
trains
should
go,
for
who
can
be
appointed
as
officers
and
what
they
shall
be
paid,
for
how
much
of
a
profit
it
ought
to
make.
it
only
has
to
cover
61
percent
of
its
costs.
mr.
david
d.
cole
it's
supposed
to...
it's
trains
are
not
supposed
to
be
any
later
than
15
minutes
for
each
stop,
your
honor.
mr.
david
d.
cole
yes.
[laughter]
in
short,
this
is
an
entity
that
has
no
independent
will
of
its
own.
mr.
david
d.
cole
the
point
is,
your
honor,
and
the
purpose
of
the
state
action
inquiry,
is
to
assign
governmental
responsibility.
ordinarily,
in
a
state
action
case,
you
have
a
clearly
private
actor,
and
you
have
some
state
influence,
and
the
court's
role
is
to
determine
whether
the
state
is
responsible--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--by...
if
it's...
if...
the
mere
fact
of
regulation,
even
extensive
regulation,
the
court
has
held,
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
state
action,
but
this
is
not
simply
a
question
of
mere
regulation.
when
you
have
the
board
appointed
by
the
united
states,
you
have
the
ownership
of
the
shares
wholly
owned
by
the
united
states--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--the
board,
it's
fiduciary
obligation
is
to
the
shareholders.
the
99-percent
shareholder
is
the
united
states.
mr.
david
d.
cole
no,
that's
true,
and
i
guess
the
question
is
somewhat...
who
is
the
united
states?
i
think
ordinarily,
as
a...
ordinarily,
the
state
action
inquiry
tries
to
assign
responsibility
between
a
private
actor
and
the
government.
here,
there
is
no
private
actor
to
which
the
court
could
point.
in
the
court's
previous
decisions
in
which
it
has
held
that
there
is
no
state
action,
the
court
has
always
pointed
to
a
private
entity
which
is
responsible
for
the
action
alleged.
in
blum,
it
was
private
doctors.
in
rendell-baker,
it
was
a
private
school,
in
jackson--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
assumptions.
i
think
it's
a...
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
objective
characteristics
of
the
entity
and
determine
whether
it
is
constitutionally...
whether
the
government
is
constitutionally
responsible
for
its
actions.
that
is
the
question.
and
in
order
to
do
that,
you
have
to
look
at
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
government
ownership,
control,
et
cetera.
mr.
david
d.
cole
for
constitutional
purposes,
we
are
saying
that
it
ought
to
be
treated
as
the
government.
mr.
david
d.
cole
for
constitutional
purposes.
mr.
david
d.
cole
it
is--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--that
is
our
first
argument,
your
honor.
our
second
argument
is
that
under
burton,
the
interrelationship
between
the
federal
government
and
this
entity
is
such
that
it
will...
it
is
a
joint
participant
with
the
entity,
and
therefore
it
is
constitutionally
responsible.
our
third
argument
is
that
the
federal
government
is
responsible
for
the
policy
challenged
here
because
the
board,
which
is
solely
composed
of
federal
appointees,
is
responsible
for
the
policy,
and--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
burton
was
a
long
time
ago,
your
honor,
but
burton
has
been--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--but
its...
it
has
not
been
overruled,
your
honor,
and
the
distinguishing
features
have
always...
the
cases
which
have
distinguished
it
are
distinguishable
from
this
case.
that
is,
the
courts
that
have
distinguished
it
have
essentially
said,
we
don't
find
joint
participation
here,
because
the
federal...
the
government
cannot
control
this
entity.
the
government
is
not
responsible
for
the
conduct.
the
government
is
not
profiting
from
the
challenged
conduct.
here,
the
government
can
control
the
entity,
the
government
controls
the
entity
through
its
ownership
and
control.
it's
the
only
way
that
a
corporation
can
be
controlled,
is
through
ownership
and
control.
the
united
states
owns
99
percent
of
the
votes,
and
appoints
the
entire
board.
in
addition--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--it's
a
much
stronger
case
than
burton,
and
in
fact
amtrak
does
not
suggest
that
we
have
not
clearly
made
a
showing
of
joint
participation
under
the
burton
test.
rather,
that
they
are--
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
there
are
numerous
other
entities,
federal
entities
which
are
for
all
intents
and
purposes
indistinguishable
from
amtrak,
and
which
have
been
treated
as
state
actors.
for
example,
the
united
states
postal
service,
the
tennessee
valley
authority,
the
fdic,
the
export-import
bank,
all
of
those
are
corporations
which
are
owned
and
controlled
by
the
government
which
have
been
held
to
be
and
treated
as...
as
state
actors,
but
are
exempt
from
numerous
laws,
statutory
laws
that
otherwise
apply
to
agencies.
procurement
laws,
civil
service
laws,
those
entities
are
exempt
from
those
laws.
so
it
is
not
treated
as
a
governmental
agency
for
all
purposes...
that
is,
for
all
statutory
purposes...
but
because
those
entities
are
owned
and
controlled
by
the
government,
they
are
treated
as
federal
actors.
mr.
david
d.
cole
--has
been...
well,
there
have
been
many
cases
where
constitutional
claims
have
been
adjudicated
against
such
entities,
yes.
the
question
of
federal
action
has
not
arisen
directly
in
this
court.
for
example,
fdic
v.
mallen
proceeds
on
the
assumption
that
the
fdic
could
have
violated
mr.
mallen's
due
process
rights,
so
the
court
has...
in
this
court--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
it
is...
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
the
fdic
is
labeled
as
a
mixed
ownership
government
corporation,
just
as
amtrak
is.
the
fdic
receives
no
federal
funding
whatsoever.
amtrak
only
survives
by
virtue
of
its
massive
annual
subsidies
from
congress.
so
i
think,
in
fact,
amtrak
is
more
of
a
governmental
entity
for
constitutional
purposes
than
the
fdic.
mr.
david
d.
cole
the
nature
of
the
function
performed
by
amtrak?
mr.
david
d.
cole
well--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
we
don't
contend
that
it
is
a
traditional
government
function,
no.
mr.
david
d.
cole
enters
penn
station?
mr.
david
d.
cole
absolutely,
and
the
district
court
found,
in
fact,
that
when
you
walk
through
penn
station,
you
can't
know,
because
penn
station
is
shared
with
other
governmental
entities...
new
jersey
transit
and
the
long
island
railroad...
you
can't
know
whether
you're
in
an
area
that
is
controlled
by
a
governmental,
clearly,
undisputably
governmental
entity
or
amtrak.
in
addition,
amtrak
itself,
i
think
many
people
would
not
know
whether
amtrak
is
governmental
or
not.
when
you
look
at
it,
it
certainly
looks
governmental.
the
united
states
owns
all
the
shares.
the
united
states
appoints
the
whole
board.
this
is,
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
a
governmental
entity.
mr.
david
d.
cole
our
position...
yes.
if
chrysler
corporation
were
nationalized,
then
it
would
be
a
government--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--our
position
is
that
when--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
i
think
the
question
with
a
corporation
is,
with
any
corporation
is,
should
you
treat
it
as
governmental,
or
should
you
treat
it
as
private?
if
the
corporation
is
controlled...
is
owned
by
51
percent
private
shareholders,
has
a
51
percent
private
majority
board,
then
it
is...
you
can
say
that
responsibility
for
its
actions
are
in
the
private
realm,
unless
there
is
something
more
which
would
establish
state
action.
where,
on
the
other
hand,
the
government
has
a
controlling
interest
both
in
ownership
and
in
appointment
of
the
board,
there's
no
private
entity
to
which
you
can
point
which
is
responsible
for
the
actions
alleged,
and
the
congress
has
recognized
this.
with
respect
to
virtually
every
other
corporation,
it
has
acknowledged
that
those
corporations
which
it
owns
in
whole
and
whose
boards
it
appoints
are
wholly-owned
government
corporations,
are
treated
as
agencies,
and
would
clearly
be
state
actors.
those
entities
which
congress
supports
which
are
privately
owned,
privately
run,
like
the
government-sponsored
enterprises
fannie
mae,
freddie
mac,
sallie
mae,
et
cetera,
those
are
treated
as
private
entities
and
ought
to
be
treated
as
private
entities,
because
they
are
privately
owned,
they
are
privately
run,
the
only
governmental
involvement
there
is
the
government
has
a
minority
representation
on
the
board,
usually
3
of
15
members
of
the
board.
but
where
an
entity
is
owned
and
controlled
by
the
united
states...
and
i
think
a
perfect
example
is
the
rural
telephone
bank.
the
rural
telephone
bank
is
a
mixed
corporation.
there's
private
ownership,
and
there
is
governmental
ownership,
and
the
way
that
congress
has
set
that
entity
up
is
that,
as
long
as
the
united
states
owns
51
percent
of
the
shares,
its
board
is
a
majority
government
appointees
with
some
private
representation
and
it
is
owned
by
the
government.
as
soon
as
51
percent
of
the
shares
switch
over
to
private
ownership,
then
the
governmental
appointees
from
the
board
drop
down
to
a
very
small
number,
and
majority
ownership...
majority
control
of
the
board
is
lodged
in
a
private
majority
board,
and
it
is
no
longer
an
agency
of
the
government.
so
congress
itself
has
recognized
that
the
question
of
ownership
and
control
is
central
to
how
you
treat
an
entity,
and
it
has...
and
many
government
corporations
are
privately
owned,
privately
run,
like
the
government-sponsored--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--our
test,
your
honor,
is
you
have
to
look
at
all
the
facts
and
circumstances.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
we
believe
that
in
this
case
all
the--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--our
position...
yes.
our
position
would
be--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--our
position
would
be
that
if
the
united
states
owns
a
controlling...
has
a
controlling
ownership
of
the
shares,
or
appoints
a
controlling
majority
of
the
board--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--that...
no.
the
federal
savings
&
loan
associations
would
be
privately...
would
be
considered
private
actors
under
that
test.
the
only
entities
that
would
be
considered
governmental
actors
under
that
test
are
those
which
are
essentially
wholly-owned
government
corporations.
essentially,
with
amtrak
congress--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--that's
right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
that's
right,
because--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--that's
right,
because
the
state
action
inquiry
is
about
responsibility,
it's
not
about
sole
responsibility.
mr.
david
d.
cole
that
means
that
the
ownership
and
control
in
and
of
themselves
are
not
sufficient
to
make
it
a
government
actor.
of
course,
if
there
is...
in
addition
there
are
factors
which
support
state
action
such
as
state
compulsion
of
the
particular
conduct,
then
it
might
be
a
state
actor.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
d.
cole
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
going
back
to
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question
regarding
the
private
initiation
of
this
policy,
the
case
that
is
closest
to
this
case
is
the
gerard
college
case,
in
which
a
privately
founded,
privately
funded,
privately
funded
institution
was
run
by
a
board
of
government
appointees,
and
this
court
found
that
the
private
founders'
policy
of
limiting
admission
to
white
males
was
state
action
because
the
board
was
responsible
for
that
policy.
the
board
didn't
adopt
that
policy,
but
the
board
was
responsible.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
found
that
the
board
was
not
a
governmental
entity,
because
the
city
had
specifically
disavowed
any
relationship
to
the
board
through
its
city
charter.
the
supreme
court
did
not
find
that
compelling,
and
that,
i
think,
underscores
that
the
case
is
not
to
be
decided
by
label--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--they
were...
it
was
a...
they
were
appointed
by
the
government.
they
were
not...
it
was
only...
it
was
a
board
of
trustees
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
but
the
city
of
philadelphia
had
said
that
this
board...
although
we
appoint
the
trustees,
this
board
does
not
constitute
a
city
entity.
this
court
said,
we
don't
decide
by
labels.
in
west
v.
atkins,
the
doctor,
who
was
held
to
be
a
state
actor,
was
not
a
government
employee.
in
cherry
cotton
mills,
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation,
the
question
was,
should
it
be
treated
as
the
united
states
for
counterclaim
purposes?
congress
had
labeled
it
a
corporation.
this
court
said
that
the
fact
that
congress
called
it
a
corporation
does
not
make
it
something
other
than
what
it
actually
is,
an
agency
selected
by
the
government
to
serve
governmental
purposes.
government
today
is
increasingly
doing
business
through
the
corporate
forum,
bringing
business
principals
into
government.
mr.
david
d.
cole
i
think
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting
is
a
difficult
question.
it's
board
is
wholly--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
its
board
is
wholly
appointed
by
the
united
states.
however,
there
are
fairly
stringent
statutory
guarantees
of
independence,
and
i
think
the
question
would
be
whether
those
statutory
guarantees
of
independence,
which
provide
that
the
board
members
cannot
be
chosen
on
a
political
basis,
and
that
no
political
person
can
affect
the
running
of
that
corporation
in
any
way--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
the
question...
because
the
question,
your
honor,
is
whether
there
is
an
independence,
a
sufficient
independence
to
this
entity
that
it
should
not
be
treated
as--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right,
and
we
think--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--that's
right,
and
we
believe
that,
ordinarily,
where
the
government
appoints
the
board,
it
ought
to
be
treated
as
a
state
actor.
as
this
court
has
held,
all
state
action
cases
depend
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case,
and
because
of
the
statutory
designation
with
respect
to
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting,
might
be
a
different
question.
that's
not
a
question
posed
here.
mr.
david
d.
cole
thank
you.
