paul

can
they
be
removed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
your
test
that
whenever
the
government
has
51
percent
control
it
becomes
a
government
actor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
51
percent
is
not,
in
itself,
enough,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
what
you
believe
in
this
case.
i'm
just
asking
you,
are
you
adopting
a
test
that
51
percent
is
enough
in
all
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are.
the
answer's
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
a
lot
of
federal
savings
&
loan
associations
around
the
country
that
are
now
government
actors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
essentially,
51
percent
owned,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
i
thought
you
said--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
saying,
wholly
owned.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
also
ask,
along
with
the
chief
justice's
question,
did
you
claim
any
waiver
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
the
cert
petition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--clearly
was
embraced
within
the
question
the
chief
justice
quoted,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
baine,
can
i
test
your
hypothesis
with
a
rather
unlikely
hypothetical
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
that
the
board,
viewing
itself
as
totally
private,
like...
it
adopted
a
policy
of
accepting
advertisements
only
from
presbyterians
and
democrats,
say,
an
extreme
example,
and
would
refuse
all
other
advertising.
congress
disapproves
of
this
policy,
and
passes
a
law
and
says,
you
do
not
have
the
freedom
to
make
that
kind
of
decision.
you
must
act
neutrally
in
all
cases.
would
that
statute
be
constitutional?
i
think
not,
if
it's
a
totally
private
entity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it
has
the
same
rights
as
its
competitor,
private
competitors
have,
it
could
engage
in
a
policy
of
selective
advertising
that
could
not
be
overruled
by
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
my
hypothetical--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--didn't
involve
the
use
of
government
funds.
it
involved
a
revenue-generating
policy,
generating
revenues
only
from
selective
advertisers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
mr.
baine,
what
do
you
do
with
cases
like
monroe
v.
pape,
where
the
city
of
chicago
certainly
didn't
approve
or
know
about
what
the
police
officers
were
doing,
but
nevertheless
was
treated
as
state
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
put
people
in
a
position
where
they
can
act
as
though
they
were
the
government,
and
here
i
guess,
amtrak
has
quite
a
bit
of
authority
to
act
in
an
important
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
they're
acting
ultra
vires.
even
though
they're
acting
beyond
their--
