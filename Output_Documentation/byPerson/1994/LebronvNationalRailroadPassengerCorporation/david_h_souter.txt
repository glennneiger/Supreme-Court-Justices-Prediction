justice
david
h.
souter
well,
does
it
have
to
be
day-to-day
operation?
i
mean,
does
the
management
have
to
be
that
precise
in
order
to
qualify?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
presume
the
governmental
officers
take
into
consideration
the
policy
choices
which
the
directors
make
or
support
when
they
decide
whether
or
not
to
reappoint
directors,
or
that
they
anticipate
those
policies
when
they
appoint
them
in
the
first
place.
that's
not
enough?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
enough,
i
take
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
basically
got
to
be
day-to-day
management
before
the
nexus
is
close
enough?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
the
government
cared.
i
mean,
if
the
president
of
the
united
states
said,
i
think
it's
appalling
that
there
are
political
advertisements
in
amtrak
stations,
would
that
be
enough?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the
director
said,
too
bad,
we
like
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
the
criterion
can't
be
whether
the
government
cares
or
not.
the
criterion
has
got
to
be
some
criterion
of
control,
hasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
it
have
to
be
a
criterion
of
control?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
only
question
is,
how
precise
must
the
control
be?
must
they
be
micromanagers
or
macromanagers,
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
just
puzzled
by
the
concept
that
an
action
is
governmental
or
nongovernmental
based
on
the
indifference
of
its
directors.
i
just
don't
understand
the
legal--
justice
david
h.
souter
--he's
also
taken
an
oath
under
the
constitution,
and
i
find
it
rather
odd
to
say
that
we
could
say,
oh,
this
is
a
business
decision,
and
we
are
not
going
to
allow
our
governmental
character
to
influence
the
policies
that
we
make.
i
think
that's...
i
thought
that's
exactly
why
they
sit
on
the
board.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
in
that
capacity
that
official,
the
secretary,
is
free
to
make
any
judgment
he
wishes
with
reference
to
matters
of
speech?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
constitutional
policies
any
part
of
that
consideration?
