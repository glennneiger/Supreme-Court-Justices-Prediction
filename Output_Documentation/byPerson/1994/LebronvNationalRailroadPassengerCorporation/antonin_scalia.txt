justice
antonin
scalia
--i
assume
its
directors,
then,
under
your
theory,
would
have
to
be
appointed
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate.
that's
a
constitutional
provision
as
well.
you
say
this
is
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
no,
you've
said
more
than
that.
you've
said,
for
constitutional
issues--
justice
antonin
scalia
--congress
can't
change
it
by
just
saying
so,
and
that
makes
sense
to
me,
but
the
only
constitutional
issue
in
the
world
is
not
the
first
amendment.
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
constitution,
one
of
which
is
the
appointments
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
assume
that
the
managers
of
this
federal
agency
would
have
to
be
appointed
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
amtrak
is
unconstitutionally
established.
justice
antonin
scalia
--inferior
officers
under
the
appointments
clause?
why
are
they
inferior
officers?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
whenever
congress
makes
that
appointment
disposition
the
agency
automatically
becomes
an
inferior
agency,
even
if
it
isn't
an
inferior
agency,
or
the
officers
become
inferior
officers
even
if
they
aren't?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
suggest
that,
but
i'm
just
exploring
the
consequences
of
your
thesis
that
amtrak
is
a
government
agency.
one
of
the
consequences,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
it
is
unconstitutionally
composed,
which
may
have
consequences
elsewhere,
though
not
with
respect
to
its
first
amendment
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
concede
that
the
executive
does
not
control
amtrak.
nobody
but
the
directors
really
decide
what
amtrak
does,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
by
a
general
law.
i
mean,
congress
could
pass
a
law,
but
they
can
control
a
lot
of
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
can't
tell
those
members
what
to
do.
it
can
throw
out
the
members
and
put
in
new
members--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
ultimately
those
members
make
the
decisions.
justice
antonin
scalia
nobody
else
in
the
united
states
government
makes
the
decisions,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet
you
say
these
officers
are
still
inferior
officers,
even
though
they
make
the
final
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
that.
i'm
not
questioning
whether
it's
a
separate
question.
mr.
cole,
what
is
the
tenure
of
the
directors?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
point.
your
point
is
that
anything
that
the
government
micromanages
becomes
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
you
have
enormous
state
influence,
the
government,
by
statute,
micromanages
a
particular
industry.
does
that
industry
become
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
board
controlled
by
the
united
states.
you
acknowledge
that
the
board
votes
the
way
it
wants,
once
it's
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
mean
whatever
the
shareholder
wants.
you
have
a
fiduciary
obligation
to
someone,
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
to
jump
the
way
that
that
person
tells
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cole,
is
it
your
position
that
the
government
cannot
acquire
a
private
company
without
making
that
private
company
the
government?
i
mean,
suppose...
the
government,
for
instance,
some
years
ago
made
a
major
loan
to
chrysler
corporation.
now,
suppose
chrysler
had
defaulted,
and
the
government
had
taken
over
ownership,
private
ownership
of
chrysler
corporation.
would
chrysler
corporation
have
become
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
nationalized.
the
government
just
gets
the
stock
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
just
as
a
private
individual
could
get
the
stock.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see,
i
mean,
we
normally
maintain
in
the
common
law
distinction
between
the
corporation
and
the
owner
of
the
corporation,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't
you
do
that,
and
why
shouldn't
you
do
that
with
respect
to
government
ownership
just
as
you
do
with
respect
to
private
ownership?
justice
antonin
scalia
couldn't
you
say
that
anybody
who
receives
government
funds
shall
not
engage
in
the
following
practices?
i
thought
we
do
that
all
the
time.
i
thought--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
activity
in
question,
as
opposed
to
the
institution?
even
if
the
government
subsidizes
amtrak,
it
can't
say
any
institution
that
gets
a
government
subsidy
shall
not
engage
in
these
forms
of
discrimination?
surely
you
can
say
that.
it
has
to
be
a
particular
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
you
willing
to
accept
de
facto
control
as
the
criterion?
i
mean,
i
can
imagine
a
lot
of
entities,
including,
for
example,
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting,
the
national
endowment
for
the
arts,
many
private
institutions
that
are
so
dependent
upon
federal
subsidies,
for
example,
that
if
it
becomes
pretty
clear
that
the
federal
government
wants
something
to
be
done,
they
will
do
it,
lest
they
lose
their
subsidies.
is
that
enough
to
make
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that's
control.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
de
facto
control,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
isn't
just
the
ability
to
control
that
you're
arguing,
it
is
the
exercise
of
the
control.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
your
position
was
he's
entirely
upholding
the
constitution
when
he
allows
a
private
entity
to
behave
like
a
private
entity.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
say
the
secretary
is
violating
his
oath
of
office
when
he
allows
a
private
entity
which
he's
been
placed
in
charge
of
to
act
like
a
private
entity.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting,
do
you
think
that's
governmental,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
difference
does
that
make?
i
mean,
you
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
board
members
are
appointed
by
government
officials.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
and
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
petitioner
lebron
creates
billboard
displays
that
comment
on
public
issues.
he
claimed
in
this
lawsuit
that
respondent
the
national
railroad
passenger
corporation
commonly
known
as
amtrak
had
violated
his
first
amendment
rights
by
rejecting
because
of
its
political
nature,
an
advertisement,
which
he
had
proposed
to
place
on
a
giant
billboard
in
amtrak’s
pennsylvania
station
in
new
york
city.
the
billboard
was
critical
of
the
coors
brewing
company
for
supporting
conservative
causes
in
particular
the
contras
in
nicaragua,
and
amtrak
said
it
was
contrary
to
its
policy
to
accept
political
advertisement.
the
district
court
rule
that
amtrak
was
bound
by
the
first
amendment
that
it
was
a
government
actor
for
first
amendment
purposes
because
of
its
close
ties
with
the
federal
government.
the
second
circuit
reversed
noting
that
amtrak
was
by
the
terms
of
the
legislation
that
had
created
it
not
the
government
entity
and
concluding
that
the
government
was
not
so
involved
with
amtrak
that
amtrak's
decisions
could
be
considered
federal
action.
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals,
congress
created
amtrak
by
the
rail
passenger
service
act
of
1970
in
order
to
avert
the
threatened
extinction
of
passenger
trains
in
the
united
states.
that
legislation
established
amtrak
as
a
district
of
columbia
corporation
and
set
congressional
goals
for
amtrak
to
achieve.
eight
of
amtrak’s
nine
directors
are
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
or
the
secretary
of
transportation.
the
ninth,
the
president
of
the
corporation
is
elected
by
those
other
eight.
amtrak
must
file
annual
reports
concerning
its
operations
with
the
president
and
congress.
the
act
does
provide
however
that
amtrak
will
not
be
an
agency
or
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
although,
that
provision
is
surely
dispositive
of
amtrak's
governmental
status
for
purposes
of
matters
within
congress
is
controlled.
for
example,
whether
the
freedom
of
information
act
applies
to
amtrak.
it
is
not
for
congress
to
make
the
final
determination
of
amtrak’s
status
as
a
government
entity
for
purposes
of
determining
the
constitutional
rights
of
citizens
affected
by
its
actions.
the
constitution
constrains
governmental
action
by
whatever
instruments
or
in
whatever
modes
that
action
maybe
taken,
and
under
whatever
congressional
label.
the
federal
government
has
often
used
corporations
to
achieve
its
governmental
ends
beginning
with
the
bank
of
the
united
states
in
1791.
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii
the
general
accounting
office
listed
58
government
corporations
including
such
entities
as
the
tennessee
valley
authority,
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
and
the
rubber
development
corporation
with
combined
assets
in
$1945
of
29.6
billion.
the
public
judicial
and
congressional
understanding
over
the
years
has
consistently
been
that
such
governmentally
created
and
controlled
corporations
are
part
of
the
government
itself.
we
accordingly
hold
that
whereas
here
the
government
creates
a
corporation
by
a
special
law
for
the
furtherance
of
governmental
objectives,
and
retains
for
itself
permanent
authority
to
appoint
a
majority
of
the
directors
of
that
corporation,
the
corporation
is
part
of
the
government
for
purposes
of
the
first
amendment.
we
remand
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
in
the
first
instance,
whether
amtrak’s
refusal
to
display
petitioner’s
advertisement
violated
the
first
amendment.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
