chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
93-1525,
lebron
v.
national
railroad
passenger
corporation.
justice
breyer
has
asked
me
to
announce
that
he
is
in
england
because
his
mother-in-law
has
passed
away
and
the
funeral
is
being
held
today,
but
that
he
will
participate
in
the
cases
argued
today,
listen
to
the
arguments
on
tape.
mr.
cole.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cole,
we
don't
have
before
us,
do
we,
any
question
as
to
whether,
if
amtrak
is
indeed
a
government
entity
as
you
contend,
whether
it
would
be
permissible
for
it
to
take
the
action
that
it
did
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
they
are
subject
to
constitutional
review,
but
the
question
of,
if
they're
subjected
to
that
constitutional
review,
is
it
permissible
or
not,
is
not
before
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
sort
of
guideline
has
congress
set
for
its
scheduling,
train
schedule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
by
act
of
congress.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
burton
was
a
long
time
ago,
mr.
cole.
it's
been
distinguished
in
many
successive
cases.
i
think
there
are
probably
closer
and
more
recent
decisions
that
state
the
court's
view
as
to
what
the
relationship
is
on
the
state
action.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
been
distinguished
in
a
number
of
succeeding
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
that
makes
it
in
many
respects
a
case
that
is
quite
different
from
burton,
if
you
have
that
dominance
of
the
government
in
the
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
converse
of
that
proposition?
if
the
ownership
is
less
than
50
percent,
does
that
mean
it
is...
it
is
not
a
government
actor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
cole.
mr.
baine,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
baine,
the
second
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
amtrak's
asserted
policy
was
not
state
action.
are
you
saying
that
a
petitioner
in
this
court
has
to
just
stick
with
exactly
the
same
arguments
on
which
he
lost
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
baine--
--well,
did
a
factual
determination,
or
a
factual
inquiry,
turn
on
that
statement?
i
mean,
were
factual
findings
avoided?
it
seems
to
me
it
was
just
an
argument
not
made
that
perhaps
could
have
been
made,
and
i
don't
see
why,
since
it's
the
same
claim,
basically,
the
petitioner
can't
now
make
it
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
does
it
make...
do
you
think
it
makes
a
difference
in
this
case
that
amtrak
inherited
this
policy
from
penn
central
and
did
nothing
about
it,
as
opposed
to
having
initiated
it
itself?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
baine.
mr.
cole,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cole.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
number
93-1525
lebron
versus
national
railroad
passenger
corporation
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
