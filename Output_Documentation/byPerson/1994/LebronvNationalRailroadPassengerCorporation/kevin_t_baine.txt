mr.
kevin
t.
baine
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
government
was
responsible
for
amtrak's
decision
to
reject
the
petitioner's
political
ad.
under
a
realistic
view
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
the
court
will
not
find
the
fingerprints
of
any
government
official
on
that
decision,
nor
will
it
find
the
shadow
of
any
government
regulation
on
amtrak's
policy.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
there
is
no--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--the
board
was
responsible.
in
fact,
the
board
did
not
know
of
the
policy,
but
it
did
have
responsibility.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
the
mere
fact
that
the
president
appoints--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--it
would
make
no
difference.
the
fact
that
the
president
appoints
the
board
of
directors
does
not
make
amtrak
a
government
instrumentality.
the
court
has
faced
that
question
directly
once
and
indirectly
another
time.
in
the
conrail
case,
the
regional
rail
reorganization
act
cases,
the
court
dealt
with
conrail.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
yes.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
and
my
point
is
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
because
in
the
regional
rail
reorganization
act
cases,
the
court
was
confronted
with
the
question
whether
or
not
the
government's
appointment
of
conrail's
board
of
directors,
and
conrail
was
an
entity
very
much
like
amtrak,
formed
for
the
same
purpose
and
with
the
same
structure,
and
the
court
said
that
the
fact
that
the
president
appointed
board
members
did
not
make
conrail
a
government
entity.
in
fcc
v.
league
of
women
voters,
the
court
faced
the
same
question
indirectly.
it
was
dealing
with
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting,
and
every
member
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting
is
appointed
by
the
president,
but
the
court
didn't
think
that
that
made
the
corporation
part
of
the
government.
in
fact,
quite
to
the
contrary.
the
court's
opinion
emphasized
that
the
corporation
was
intended
to
provide
insulation
against
government
interference
in
the
affairs
of
the
stations
that
received
money
from
the
corporation.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
there
were
a
number
of
changes.
there
was
a
change
pertaining
to
amtrak
after
that
case.
however--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--well,
there
were
several
changes.
the
board
composition
was
changed
slightly
and
the
ownership
was
changed
slightly.
but
conrail--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--the
united
states
required
an
ownership
interest
and
appointed
more
board
members,
and
conrail,
however,
at
the
time
the
board
in...
the
united
states
in
fact
was
able
to
control
the
majority
of
the
board.
the
petitioner
has
made
the
point
that
conrail
wasn't
really
functioning
yet,
and
so
we
shouldn't
pay
too
much
attention--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--to
the
conrail
case.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
but
they
didn't
change
the
issue
that
the
court
addressed
in
the
conrail
case,
which
was
whether
or
not
appointment
of
board
members
by
the
president
made
an
entity
a
part
of
the
government.
the
most
important
fact,
i
think,
to
bear
in
mind
here
is
that--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--we
most
certainly
do,
and
this
is
not
a
case
as
in
yee,
in
which
a
party
simply
failed
to
raise
a
question,
or
failed
to
raise
an
argument.
the
argument
and
the
question
was
specifically
raised
and
explicitly
waived
and
conceded.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
think
the
court--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--i
think
the
court
should
address
the
case
on
the
basis
upon
which
it
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
would
come
as
a
surprise,
i
would
think,
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
learn
that
its
judgment
was
going
to
be
reversed
on
the
basis
of
an
argument
that
was
explicitly
conceded--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--and
so
we
say
the
question--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--i
don't
think
it's
precisely
the
same.
i
think
this
court
has
on
a
number
of
occasions
faced
the
argument
that
the
petitioner
is
making
that,
by
virtue
of
a
close
relationship
between
the
government
and
an
entity
that
is
nominally
not
the
government,
there
is
state
action.
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
when
that
argument
is
made,
the
proper
inquiry
is
whether
the
relationship
between
the
government
and
the
otherwise
private
entity
affected
the
decision
or
the
policy
that's
under
review.
the
fact
that
the
government
might
appoint
board
members
here,
or
that
there
might
be
some
other
connections,
at
the
very
most
would
suggest
that
it's
conceivable
that
the
government
might
have
asserted
some
influence--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--but
that
only
frames
the
question.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
wouldn't
go
quite
that
far,
but
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
permit
the
petitioner
to
raise
an
argument
that
he
explicitly
conceded,
and
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals...
where
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
relied
upon
that
concession.
the
petitioner
said,
we
do
not
argue
that
amtrak
is
a
government
entity,
but
we
accept
that
it
is,
generally
speaking,
a
private
entity.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
if
the
argument
had
not
been
explicitly
waived,
the
evidence
might
well
have
been
different,
but
i'm
perfectly
happy
to
address
the
merits
of
the
argument.
i
think
the
merits--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--no,
because
the
petition
for
certiorari
does
not
make
the
explicit
argument
that's
made
for
the
first
time
in
the
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
that--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--well,
there
are
two
questions
here.
one
is
whether
it's
fairly
embraced
if
you
read
the
question
very
generously
to
the
petitioner,
and
that
might
be
so,
but
our
point
is
different.
our
point
is,
if
you're
going
to
read
it
that
generously,
you're
going
to
read
it
to
include
an
argument
that
was
explicitly
withdrawn
from
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
i'm
prepared
to
address
the
question
in
case
the
court
does
entertain
it.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
i
would
simply
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
petitioner's
brief
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
in
which
they
said
they
do
not
contend
that
amtrak
is
a
government
entity,
but,
rather,
a
private
entity
so
interrelated
to
federal
entities
that
it's
to
be
treated
as
a
state
actor
here.
now,
if
the
question
is
presented
whether
or
not
this
is
a
federal
agency
or
instrumentality
for
all
purposes,
our
answer
to
that
question
is
no
for
three
reasons.
first,
because
congress
very
unambiguously
said
the
entity
they
were
creating
was
not
to
be
considered
part
of
the
government.
second,
because
this
court
said
in
the
pass
rider
case,
atchison,
topeka,
and
santa
fe
case,
that
amtrak
is
not
a
governmental
entity,
but
rather
a
private
corporation.
and
third,
because
there
were
valid
and
legitimate
reasons
why
congress
said
that
amtrak
should
not
be
a
part
of
the
government
and,
indeed,
today
amtrak
has
important
features
that
are
not
at
al
like
a
government
agency,
and
that
are
very
much
like
a
business.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
one
could
call
it
quasi-public
in
the
sense
that
that
word
is
sometimes
used
to
refer
to
corporate
entities.
there
are
aspects
of
amtrak
that
one
could
say
are
public
in
the
sense
the
public
rides
the
trains,
and
it's
certainly
true
that
the
government
regulates
amtrak
and
has
the
other
relationships
that
we've
been
talking
about.
but
our
position
is
that
if
you
have
an
entity
that
arguably
has
some
features
that
may
be
governmental
and
some
that
are
private,
the
appropriate
question
is,
what
about
the
action
or
the
policy
that
we're
talking
about
here,
is
that
influenced
by
the
fact
that
the
government's
involved,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
clearly
no.
the
policy
against
political
advertising--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--certainly.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
we
would
begin
the
analysis
with
the
question
whether
or
not
amtrak
has
any
first
amendment
rights,
and
we
would
say
that
it
does,
and
then
we
would
ask
whether
or
not
there
was
a
compelling
state
interest
that
justified
the
legislation
that
said
amtrak
couldn't
discriminate
in
that
sense.
in
that
case,
it
could
come
out
either
way.
it
really
wouldn't
affect
this
question.
but
we
would
contend
that
amtrak
does
have
first
amendment
rights
in
the
same
way
that
its
competitors
have.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
that
may
be,
but
it
is
a
far-fetched
hypothetical,
and
in
fact
the
policy
in
this
case
is
that
amtrak
wanted
very
much
to
stay
away
from
all
matters
of
controversy,
to
avoid
any
suggestion
that
they're
favoring
one
side
or
the
other
in
political
debate,
and
have
no
political
advertising
whatsoever,
and
we
think
that's
a
policy
choice
they
ought
to
be
able
to
make.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
under
rust
v.
sullivan,
i
think
congress
would
have
the
power
to
control
the
expenditure
of
public
funds,
and
if
the
concern
here
is
that
amtrak
receives
government
funds
and
might
misuse
government
funds
in
a
way
that
the
congress
thought
was
inappropriate,
i
think
congress
would
have
greater
ability
to
restrict
amtrak's
use
of
those
funds
than
it
would
have
an
ability
to
restrict
the
use
of
american
airlines
funds--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--which
are
not
coming
all
from
the
government.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
then
it
might
be
immune.
but--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--there's
no
question
that
if
the
activity
involves
the
expenditure
of
government
funds
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
answer
is
the
government
can
regulate.
if
the
question
doesn't
involve
the
expenditure
of
government
funds
at
all,
i
think
it
would
be
a
question
that
would
be
hotly
debated.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
it
wouldn't
be
of
any
great
concern
to
amtrak
if
the
case
came
out
that
way,
and
no
doubt
the
petitioner
would
be
arguing
that's
exactly
the
way
it
should
come
out.
i
said
before
that--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--amtrak
could
have
such
a
policy.
the
important
point
to
bear
in
mind,
i
think,
is
that
amtrak
is
continuing
in
the
same
business
of
the
railroads
that
it
succeeded,
and
it
is
important
and
it's
desirable,
it
seems
to
me,
that
congress
have
the
flexibility
to
approach
crises
in
the
business
world,
to
essentially
reorganize
and
restructure
and
industry,
as
it
did
in
this
case,
without
necessarily
saddling
the
enterprise
that
results
with
all
of
the
obligations
of
government.
amtrak's
competitors
in
the
airlines
and
the
bus
companies
are
not
required
to
observe
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
constitution,
and
it
is
important
that
amtrak
be
able
to
compete
on
an
even
playing
field.
if
we
look
at
amtrak's
function,
we
see
that
its
function
is
commercial,
not
governmental.
it
doesn't
govern
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
it
doesn't
make
policy,
it
doesn't
regulate
business,
it
is
a
business.
if
we
look
at
its
structure--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--well,
the
function
of
the...
the
function
of
the
entity
is
significant.
it
is
not
the
only
factor,
but
it
is
significant,
and--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--i
think
i
have
to
say
yes.
[laughter]
i
don't
want
to
bite
off
too
much.
we'll
accept
mccullough
v.
maryland.
but
there
are
many
things
about
amtrak
that
are
not
at
all
governmental.
its
structure
is
a
structure
of
a
private
corporation,
and
it
makes
a
difference.
there
are
private
shareholders
who
contribute
private
capital
to
the
formation
of
this
company.
it
is
managed
by
a
board
of
directors
who
are,
for
the
most
part,
except
for
two
people,
private
citizens,
not
public
officials.
they
don't
take
an
oath
to
support
and
defend
the
constitution.
they
assume
a
fiduciary
duty
to
try
to
operate
this
business
as
a
business,
and
to
try
to
make
money.
the
management
and
control
of
this
corporation
is
in
the
hands
of
its
board,
not
the
united
states
government.
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
government,
the
president,
the
secretary
of
transportation,
has
ever
attempted
to
interfere
in
the
day-to-day
operations
of
amtrak,
and
there's
certainly
no
evidence
that
the
government--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--there's
no
evidence
that
the
government
interfered
in
the
operation
at
all,
except
insofar
as--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--well,
one
of
the
things
that
might
have
been
different
if
the
petitioner
made
the
argument--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
enough.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
i
think
in
fact
there
ought
to
be
some
evidence
that
the
government
cared
about
amtrak's
advertising
policy,
and
if
there
are
some
things
about
amtrak
that
may
arguably
be
governmental,
and
some
that
are
commercial,
this
surely
falls
on
the
commercial
side
of
the
line.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
that
probably
would
be
enough,
but
it
depends
on
how
you
read--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--that
would
show
the
independence.
but
the
point
is
that--
[laughter]
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
think
there
are
two
ways
to
look
at
it.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
would
say
yes,
and--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--well,
when
the
court
has
faced
the
question
in
the
past
that
because
of
a
relationship
between
the
government
and
another
entity
there
is
state
action,
the
court
has
asked
the
question
whether
or
not
the
government
exercises
any
control,
overt
or
covert,
over
the
particular
decision
that
is
at
issue
in
the
case,
and
that
surely
did
not
happen
here.
the
petitioner
is
taking
the
position
that,
even
though
the
government
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
this
particular
policy...
indeed,
it's
not
even
a
case
in
which
the
government
acquiesced
in
a
policy,
because
there's
no
evidence
that
it
even
knew
about
it,
but
the
petitioner
takes
the
position
that
even
though
that
is
the
case,
the
government's
domination
of
amtrak
is
so
complete
that
we
must
assume
that
everything
it
does
is
governmental.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
no,
it
isn't.
the
only
thing
we
accept--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--the
only
thing--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--the
only
thing
we
accept
is
that
if
the
government,
in
fact,
exercised
control
over
the
particular
decision,
then
there
would
be
state
action.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
that
is
correct.
the
ability
to
control
frames
the
question,
and
the
question
is,
was
the
ability
exercised?
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
the
police
officers--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--but
we
regard
government
officials
as
the
government,
and
we
always
have,
and
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--that's
the
way
we've
always
viewed
it,
and
i
don't
think
that
that
affects
this
case
in
any
way.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
think
it
underscores
the
degree
to
which
this
is
not
a
governmental
action
or
policy
at
all.
the
case
would
come
out
the
same
way
if
amtrak
formulated
the
policy,
but
the
fact
that
it
was
formulated
by
the
pennsylvania
railroad
underscores
that
it's
the
kind
of
decision
that
is
a
business
decision.
it's
not
governmental
at
all.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
no,
i'm
not...
if
i--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--if
i
suggested
that,
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that.
what
i
mean
is,
by
its
very
nature,
it
is
not
governmental.
that's
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make.
the
board,
no
question,
has
the
ability
to
control
that
policy,
but
it
is
very
important,
i
think,
to
underscore
the
point
that
the
court
has
never
suggested
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
government
may
have
the
power
to
appoint
board
members
makes
the
entity
a
governmental
entity,
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
incorrect
statement
to
make.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
anybody
on
the
board
has
ever
buckled
under
to
the
pressure
of
a
president.
judges
are
appointed
by
presidents,
and
some
judges
are
appointed
by
something
other
than
life
terms,
for
fixed
terms.
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
assume
that
these
board
members
would
violate
their
fiduciary
duty
and
take
an
action
that's
not
take
for
the
business
interests
of
the
corporation,
but,
rather,
to
promote
some
political
or
governmental
objective.
if
that
is
the
theory
of
the
case--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--the
secretary
has
a
continuing
relationship
to
the
president
in
a
way
that
judges
do
not,
and
that
is
true,
but
the
point
is
that--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--of
one
member
of
the
board,
and
not--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--of
any
of
the
others.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
one
government
official,
one
federal
government
official
sits
on
the
board.
the
board
is
composed
primarily
of
private
citizens
who
are
appointed
by
the
president,
but
who
are,
in
fact,
initially
selected
by
other
bodies.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
think
he's
entitled
to
vote
the
way
he
feels
his
fiduciary
duty
compels
him
to
vote,
and
i
don't
think
the
mere
fact
that
one
of
the
board
members
also
serves
as
secretary
of
transportation
makes
the
board's
decision
a
government
decision.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
i
think
they're
certainly
part
of
the
consideration,
but
when
one
out
of
nine
members
of
a
board
has
taken
an
oblig...
an
oath
to
uphold
the
constitution,
that
doesn't
affect
the
way
the
other
eight
think,
nor
is
it
fair
to
assume
that--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--well,
we'd
certainly
take
that
position,
too.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
no,
i
don't
think
that
he
would.
i
think
that
he
obviously
has
in
the
back
of
his
mind
some
sense
of
his
other
job,
i
suppose,
but
when
he
sits
on
that
board,
he
has
to
function
like
a
board
member,
and
he
has
to
ask
himself,
how
are
we
going
to
run
this
board
like
a
business,
and
he
certainly
does
not
violate
his
oath
when
he
in
fact
carries
out
his
obligation
as
a
board
member.
the
court
has
considered
the
question
whether
or
not
amtrak
is
a
governmental
actor
for
purposes
of
a
due
process
challenge
in
the
pass
rider
case.
the
question
in
that
case
was
whether
certain
agreements
entered
into
by
amtrak
were
governmental
agreements,
such
that
when
congress
came
along
later
and
impaired
the
obligations
of
those
contracts,
it
impaired
the
obligations
of
the
united
states,
and
the
court
said,
no,
that's
not
the
case,
amtrak
is
not
part
of
the
united
states,
those
contracts
are
not
obligations
of
the
united
states,
they
are
obligations
of
a
private
entity.
the
label
that
congress
placed
on
amtrak
was
not
a
mere
label.
it
has
meaning,
and
it
has
consequences.
in
fact,
it's
an
instruction
to
amtrak
that
it
is
not
to
regard
itself
as
part
of
the
government,
and
it's
also
an
instruction
to
the
government
that
it's
not
to
think
that
it
can
exercise
control
over
amtrak's
affairs.
it's
a
statement
that
amtrak
doesn't
speak
for
the
government,
and
the
government
is
not
generally
bound
by
what
amtrak
says.
at
the
very
least,
this
statement
by
congress
means
that
amtrak
and
the
government
are
separate
entities
and,
as
a
general
matter,
the
government
is
not
responsible
for
what
amtrak
does.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
don't
know
that
i
can
give
a
list
of
entities
that
are
subject,
but
the
fact
that
this
corporation--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--in
general,
it
doesn't,
and
i
think
it
does
show
that
congress
was
not
simply
acting
blindly.
congress
recognized
that
there
are
some
things
about
amtrak
that
suggest
that
it
ought
to
ask
whether
or
not
certain
statutory
policies
apply,
and
in
the
case
of
foia,
it
decided
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
the
public
could
examine
amtrak's
affairs
and
be
able
to
learn
about
how
to
conduct
itself.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
in
some--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
yes.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
no,
but
in
the
inspector
general
act,
the
congress
said,
we're
doing
this,
but
we
recognize
that
amtrak
is
not
part
of
the
government.
what
the
statement
by
congress
that
has
been
accepted
by
this
court
means
is
that
as
a
general
matter,
the
government
is
not
responsible.
there
may
be
some
instances
where
the
government
is
responsible
for
what
amtrak
does,
but
we
would
suggest
that
those
instances
are
instances
in
which
the
government
has,
either
by
law,
or
by
regulation,
or
by
exercise
of
coercion
or
influence,
had
some
impact
on
amtrak's
decision,
and
that
is
not
the
case
here.
this
is
a
case
of
government
inaction.
insofar
as
this
policy
was
concerned,
the
government
was
completely
inactive
and
uninterested,
and
that
is
why
the
argument,
until
the
briefs
in
this
court,
has
been
that
there's
government
action
under
the
theory
of
burton,
which
was
a
case
in
which,
under
very
unusual
circumstances,
this
court
did
hold
that
the
government's
inaction
amounted
to
action.
burton
has
never
been
applied
beyond
the
limited
factual
setting
in
which
it
occurred,
and
the
last
place
to
apply
it
would
be
in
a
case
involving
the
first
amendment,
where
the
constitutional
command
essentially
is
to
be
inactive,
and
to
leave
the
decisions
regarding
speech
to
private
entities.
the
position
that
we
think
is
supported
by
the
cases
is
that
in
a
case
like
this,
when
there
is
evidence
that
the
government
has,
in
fact,
influenced
or
affected
the
decision
that
took
place,
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
government
is
responsible.
but
when
the
government
has
not
had
any
influence
whatsoever
over
the
particular
action,
in
those
cases
when
amtrak
has
made
a
decision
for
purely
business
reasons,
it
ought
to
have
the
same
freedom
to
act
that
its
competitors
enjoy.
thank
you
very
much.
