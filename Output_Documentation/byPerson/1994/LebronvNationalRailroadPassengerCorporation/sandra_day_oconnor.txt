justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cole,
in
the
proceedings
in
courts
below,
it
appeared
to
me
that
your
client
waived
any
argument
in
the
nature
of
a
direct
argument
that
amtrak
is
a
government
agency,
and
instead
proceeded
on
a
rather
different
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
understood,
at
least,
that
in
the
courts
below
the
position
was
taken
that
we
don't
contest
the
fact
here
that...
and
make
the
point
that
amtrak
is
an
agency
of
the
federal
government.
instead,
we
say
that
there
was
a
sufficiently
close
nexus
here
that
we
will
approach
it
on
a
different
basis.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
trying
to
argue
that
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--because
it
looks
like
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
baine,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
plaintiff
waived
the
argument
below
about
the
direct
question,
is
amtrak
a
government
agency?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
do
we
do
with
it
here?
we
address
the
government
function
inquiry,
the
close
nexus
inquiry--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--all
right.
may
i
ask,
in
making
that
analysis,
whether
it
is
the
same
analysis
we
would
make
if
it
were
a
question
of,
for
instance,
state
sovereignty,
asking
whether
it's
an
arm
of
the
state
for
state
sovereignty
purposes.
is
it
the
same
analysis?
