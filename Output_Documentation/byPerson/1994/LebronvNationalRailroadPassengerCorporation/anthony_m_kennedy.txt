mr.
cole,
i
suppose
in
the
abstract
we
could
approach
the
issue
in
either
of
two
ways.
we
could
approach
it
by
asking
the
question
whether,
for
purposes
of
controlling
advertising
policy,
amtrak
should
be
regarded
as
a
federal
entity,
a
characterization
way
of
approaching
the
case,
and
the
other
way
would
be
to
approach
it
on
the
assumption,
arguendo,
that
amtrak
is
private,
and
yet
ask
the
question
whether
the
control
by
the
national
government
through
the
appointment
process
and
so
on
is
so
great
that
the
relationship,
the
nexus,
however
you
want
to
call
it,
is
established.
would
it
make
any
difference,
for
the
outcome
of
this
case,
whether
we
went
the
characterization
route
of
analysis
as
distinct
from
the
relationship
to
the
undoubted
national
government
kind
of
analysis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
mr.
cole,
may
i
interrupt
you
here?
i
thought
the
assumption
of
the
argument...
since
you
have
not
proceeded
on
the
basis
of
the
characterization
theory,
i
thought
the
assumption
of
the
argument
was
that
for
the
sake
of
argument,
we
will
assume
that
amtrak
is
private,
and
the
question
is
whether
its
connection
with
the
undoubted
government,
i.e.,
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
transportation
and
so
on,
is
such
as
to
justify
concluding
that
the
action
that
it
takes
is
ultimately
state
action.
and
now
you
keep...
now
in
your
argument
you're
referring
to
amtrak
not
as
a
private
actor,
but,
in
effect,
as
a
governmental
actor,
and
if
we
make
that
assumption,
it's
all
over.
we
know
what
the
answer
is,
because
we
know
who
made
the
choice
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
agree,
but
the...
aren't
you
kind
of
sneaking
a
different
kind
of
approach
in,
not
necessarily
intentionally,
here,
when
you
say,
well,
there
isn't
a
private
actor
here
as
distinct
from
burton-like
cases,
because
once
you
do
that
you're
saying,
well,
amtrak
really
is
not
a
private
actor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the...
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
you
are...
you
are
depending
in
part
on
the
characterization
argument
here.
this
is
not
a
burton
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
person
who
take
the
action,
i.e.,
the
vice
president
here,
is
an
agent
of
a
governmental
organization.
that's
your
argument...
governmental
entity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
nature
of
the
challenged
action
in
this
case
does
not
particularly
help
your
state
action
argument,
does
it?
that
is
to
say,
in
a
case
like
the
preemptory
challenge
case,
we
said
only
governments
can
have
juries,
only
governments
can
have
preemptory
challenges.
here,
all
businesses
of
a
private
nature
control
the
speech
that's
contained,
so
the
nature
of
the
action
taken
here
doesn't
particularly
help
you,
does
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
nature
of
the
action
that
you
challenge.
that
is
to
say--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--regulating
the
billboard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does...
do
you
think
that
when
someone
enters
the
station
they
think,
i'm
in
a
government
building?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
the
board
of
directors
of
amtrak
would
have
had
authority
to
set
the
policy
for
advertising
if
they'd
thought
it
worth
their
time
and
attention.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
really,
you
can
attribute
to
the
directors
of
the
corporation
the
acts
of
its
subordinate
officers,
can't
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it
had?
suppose
it
had
adopted
the
policy?
would
the
result
then
be
any
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
i'm
not
sure
why
we're
talking
about
it,
then.
but--
[laughter]
why
wouldn't
it
have
made
a
difference?
suppose
the
board
of
directors
said,
this
will
be
our
policy,
and
they
had
a
policy
which
was
highly
restrictive
of
certain
forms
of
speech?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
before
we
get
there,
i
just
want
to
ask
whether
or
not,
isn't
it
fair
for
us
assign
this
policy
to
the
directors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
goes
to
the
merits.
what
justice
stevens
presents
is
the
specter
of
a
corporation
that
is
beyond
congress'
control,
a
corporation
that
on
the
one
hand
congress
funds,
subsidizes,
and
controls
the
appointment
of
100
percent
of
its
directors,
but
on
the
other
hand
it
cannot
be
controlled
by
the
congress.
that
is
very
odd.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
sounds
like
it
describes
the
bank
of
the
united
states,
which
was
given
governmental...
intergovernmental
immunity
in
mccullough
v.
maryland.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
mccullough
v.
maryland
was
correctly
decided?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
perhaps
you
can
remind
me,
were
the
trustees
of
gerard
college
ex
officio
members,
or
were
they
simply
private
people
that
were
appointed
by
the
city?
