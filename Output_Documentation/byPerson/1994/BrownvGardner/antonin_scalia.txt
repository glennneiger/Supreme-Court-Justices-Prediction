during
most
of
that
period
there
was
no
opportunity
for
judicial
review
of
that
judgment,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
would
presumably
mean
that
what
was
being
done
pleased
the
then-current
committees
of
congress.
it
would
have
very
little
to
do
with
what
the
statute
when
originally
enacted,
by
perhaps
quite
different
people,
meant.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dumont--
--would
you
expect--
--i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
would
you
expect
the
veterans
committee
of
congress
to
object
to
the
va
giving
away
too
many
benefits?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying,
if...
the
government's
case,
if
i
understand
it,
is
there
is
no
recovery
even
if
it
is
not
a
common,
foreseeable
consequence
of
the
operation,
but
if
there
is
some
flukish
consequence
of
the
operation
you
would
say
there's
no
recovery
unless
it's
a
result
of
negligence,
right,
whereas
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
puts
is
a
question
where
it
is
the
foreseeable
and
normal
consequence
of
the
operation.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
not
the
argument
you're
making.
you
are
not
making
the
argument
that
this
plaintiff
cannot
recover
because
this
was
the
normal
consequence
and,
therefore,
when
the
operation
was
decided
upon
you
expected
to
have
this
and,
therefore,
you
suffered
no
injury.
you're
making
the
argument
that
even
if
you
didn't
expect
this,
even
if
it
was
unforeseeable,
it's
not
an
injury
because
there
was
no
negligence.
that's
a
quite
different
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dumont,
why
do
you
divide
it
into
two
categories?
you
say
that
there
are
two
things
that
they
had
in
mind,
one
is
negligence
and
the
other
is
unanticipated
consequences.
wouldn't
unanticipated
consequences
alone
cover
negligence
as
well?
i
mean,
couldn't
it
simply
be
a
regime
in
which
the
normal
consequences
of
this
operation
are
expected
to
be
borne?
they
are
not
an
injury,
but
if
they
are
unanticipated,
whether
because
the
doctor
was
negligent,
and
surely
that's
not
anticipated,
or
for
any
other
reason,
they
are
covered.
doesn't
that
come
to
the
same
thing?
i
have
a
lot
of
trouble
reading
in
a
negligence
requirement.
there's
just
no
language
in
this
statute
that
smells
of
negligence.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
understand
that.
why
do
you
make
your
case
hard
by
trying
to
drag
in
a
negligence
requirement?
you're
not
arguing
for
a
negligence
requirement
at
all.
you're
simply
arguing
for
foreseeability
versus
nonforeseeability.
that's
really
a
different
thing.
what
is
added
to
the
things
that
are
excluded
by
your
arguing
about
negligence?
isn't
it
the
case
that
any
injury
produced
by
negligence
would
have
been
an
unforeseeable
injury,
not
the
normally
expected
consequence
of
the
procedure?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hannon,
could
you
tell
me
whether...
what
is
the
difference
between
you
and
the
government,
if
the
government's
position
is
taken
to
be
not
a
requirement
of
negligence
but
simply
a
requirement
that
the
injury
not
be
one
of
the
normal
or
possible...
known
to
be
possible
consequences
of
the
medical
procedure?
would
you
still
quarrel
with
that
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
shortness
of
breath
after
removal
of
a
diseased
lung?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
covered?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean,
there's
no
language
in
the
statute
that
would
exclude
that,
but
just,
it's
so
absurd
you
will
ignore
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
is
that
your
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
language
in
the
statute
excludes
the
veteran
suing
for
shortness
of
breath
after
he
has
voluntarily
agreed
to
have
a
lung
removed?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
an
additional
injury.
i
mean,
he
didn't
have
shortness
of
breath
before.
now,
he
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
looking
for
the
language
in
the
statute.
what
language
in
the
statute
excludes
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
language?
justice
antonin
scalia
gangrene's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see,
and
the
leg
was
not
usable
before
anyway,
is
that
the
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
is
your
position?
your
position
is,
i
gather,
that
if
the
consequence
is
100
percent
sure,
if
you
have
a
gangrenous
leg
removed,
you
will
not
have
a
leg,
that's
100
percent
sure.
therefore,
that
is
intended.
but
if
the
va
tells
you,
what
if
the
va
tells
you
there's
a
50-50
chance
that
if
you
have
this
procedure
you'll
have
this
other
side
effect,
is
that
intended?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
an
intended
consequence?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
how
they're...
i
want
to
know
what
your
answer
to
it
is.
i
didn't
ask
how
it
should
be
resolved.
what
is
your
answer
to
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
50
percent
chance.
is
that
intended?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
that
translate
into
an
answer
to
my
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
need
to
know
anything
more
than
what
i've
told
you?
he
is
told
that
if
you
have
this
operation,
there's
a
50-percent
chance
that
you
will
have
this
accompanying
disability.
do
you
want
the
operation?
he
says,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
an
intended
consequence?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
it's
an
additional
disability.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
only
100...
what
about
75
percent?
there's
a
75-percent...
is
that
intended?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
caused
in
all
of
these
cases.
it
says
it's
caused.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
trying
to
find
out
what
you
mean
by
intended.
is
the
only
thing
you
mean
by
intended
that
you
are
100
percent
sure
that
this
will
happen?
if
you
remove
a
lung,
you'll
be
short
of
breath.
if
you
remove
the
leg,
you
will
not
have
a
leg.
is
that
the
only
thing
you
are
willing
to
acknowledge
is
an
intended
consequence
of
the
operation
on
the
part
of
the
patient?
justice
antonin
scalia
100
percent.
75
percent
won't
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
start
throwing
around
words
like
"intended",
it
seems
to
me
you've
gotten
yourself
into
foreseeability,
at
least
where...
where
the
consequences
are
told
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
care
how
foreseeable
they
are.
i
thought
we've
established,
if
it's
100
percent,
you
will
not
allow
them
to
be...
shortness
of
breath.
you
will
not
allow
that
to
be
compensated.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
you
can't
talk
about
factual
bases
without
talking
about
the
law.
i
mean,
what
we're
arguing
about
here
is,
what
facts
are
relevant?
is
the
fact
that
it's
25
percent
chance
of
this
occurring,
is
that
a
relevant
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
think
it's
any
answer
to
say,
you
know,
in
the
hard
case
we
can...
you
know,
you
can
handle
it
by
the
factual
determinations.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dumont,
i
was
asking
you
earlier
about
just
the
law
in
general,
and
i
guess
we
sort
of
came
to
the
conclusion
that
you
really
don't
have
to
establish
a
separate
negligence
rule,
that
it
would
be
enough
if
you
had
a
rule
that
any
reasonably
anticipable
consequence,
if
that
is
a
word,
would
not
be
triggered,
this
compensation.
how
does
that...
how
would
such
a
rule
apply
to
this
case?
how
was
this
case
decided
by
the
courts
below?
was
it
decided
only
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
negligence
and
therefore
no
compensation,
or
was
there
a
finding
of
both
no
negligence
and
also
that
the
consequences
were
an
anticipable
result
of
the
operation?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
to
win
the
case
up
here
we
have
to
agree
with
you
that
there
is
simply
a
no-negligence
test.
