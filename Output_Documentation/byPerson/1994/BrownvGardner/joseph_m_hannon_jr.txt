mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
good
morning.
i
would
like
first
to
address
a
number
of
points
that
were
made
by
mr.
dumont
in
his
argument
before
i
proceed
to
my
presentation.
first,
there
was
a
suggestion
that
because
the
va
adjudicates
compensation
claims
in
a
proper
fashion
and
there's
no
evidence
that
they
do
so
in
an
improper
fashion,
this
scheme
of
fault
or
accident
is
permissible.
in
mr.
gardner's
own
case,
the
va
did
not
adjudicate
his
compensation
claim
according
to
their
own
standards.
he
applied
to
the
regional
office
in
waco,
texas,
with
the
assistance
of
va
personnel
who
actually
gave
him
the
form
to
fill
out
initially,
and
the
hearing
officer,
who
was
a
lay
person,
not
trained
in
the
law
or
medicine,
but
someone
whose
job
it
is
to
attempt
to
apply
the
statutes
of
congress
to
compensation
claims,
denied
mr.
gardner's
claim
based
upon
an
outdated
regulation.
the
regulation
that
was
utilized
by
the
hearing
officer
was
one
that
was
amended
by
the
veterans
administration
in
1978.
it
had
existed
from
1936
to
1978.
it
was
the
most
stringent
regulation
that
the
va
has
ever
applied.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
it
bears
on
the
question
that's
presented
because
of
the
argument
of
the
veterans
administration
that
the
court
should
defer
to
a
so-called
longstanding
method
of
interpreting
the
statute,
and
their
longstanding
method
of
interpreting
the
statute
wasn't
even
applied
accurately
in
mr.
gardner's
case.
there
was
a
question
of
justice
souter,
i
believe,
about
the
percentages
of
cases
that
we're
really
talking
about
here,
and
that
question
was
asked
by
judge
archer
at
the
federal
circuit,
and
this
court
doesn't
know,
because
the
va
hasn't
presented
to
the
court
any
evidence,
or
to
any
court
any
evidence
of
what
kinds
of
cases
we're
talking
about
here,
and
the
numbers
of
cases
we're
talking
about,
other
than
the
harvard
study,
which
is
completely
speculative,
as
amicus
paralyzed
veterans
indicates.
the
veterans--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
gardner
read
the
statute
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
va
that
said,
i
have
an
injury
as
a
result
of
surgical
treatment
that
has
resulted
in
additional
disability.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
there--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--it
is
not,
and
the
department
says
it's
not
covered--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--and
we
say
it's
not
covered
for
different
reasons.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
the
reason
of
the
department
is
that
it's
an
absurd
result
of
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute.
if
the
court
wishes
to
accept
that
explanation,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous
and
requires
a
fault-based
or
accident-based
regulation--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--that's
the
department's
view.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
it
is
not.
my
view
is--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--the
language
in
the
statute
is
that
language
which
requires
that
there
be
an
additional
disability
as
a
result
of
an
injury
which
itself
is
the
result
of
hospital
treatment.
the
va--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--under
the
va
compensation
system,
an
additional
disability
is
a
disability
which
causes
a
diminishment
in
the
veteran's
ability
to
earn
a
living.
that
is
the
gist
of
the
compensation
scheme
that
runs
throughout
the
veteran's
administration
law.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
that's
the
language
that
we
rely
on.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
it
must
result
in
an
"additional
disability".
if
the
veteran
goes
to
the
va...
i
would
like
to
use
the
gangrene
example.
i'll
use
the
lung
example
if
the
court
wishes--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--and
says,
i
have
diabetes,
and
as
a
result
of
diabetes
i've
developed
an
infection
in
my
leg.
what
should
be
done
here?
and
the
physicians
at
the
va
medical
hospital,
in
conjunction,
in
consultation
with
the
veteran,
make
a
decision,
an
informed
decision,
that
they're
going
to
amputate
that
leg,
and
they
do
so.
there
would
be
no
claim
for
benefits
available
to
the
veteran
because
his
earning
capacity,
his
additional
disability,
would
be
determined
by
comparing
his
condition
after
the
amputation
of
the
leg
with
his
condition
before
the
treatment
in
the
hospital.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
the
question
would
be
whether
he
has
an
additional
disability.
if
it
is
decided
to
remove
the
leg
because
in
the
absence
of
that
surgery
he's
going
to
die
from
poison,
he
doesn't
have
an
additional
disability
as
contemplated
by
congress
in
the
compensation
scheme.
i
would
also
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
words
"as
a
result
of
the
surgical
treatment.
"
also
make
it
clear
that
that
is
not
a
compensable
condition.
it's
because
the
amputation
of
a
leg
did
not
occur
as
a
result
of
surgery
or
treatment
in
a
direct
causal
sense,
as
the
department
would
like
the
court
to
apply,
but
as
a
matter
of
an
informed
choice
by
the
veteran
with
his
physician
to
contemplate
the
intended
outcome
of
medical
treatment.
that
is,
the
amputation
of
the
leg.
we
all
agree
that
this
statute
does
not
apply
to
the
intended
outcomes
of
medical
care
and
treatment.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
i
think
our
no-fault
reading
of
the
statute
necessarily
includes
that
type
of--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--negligent
conduct.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
it
would
necessarily
include
that.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
justice
souter,
we
reject
even
the
informed
consent
analysis
that
is
proposed
by
the
department
here,
because
that
is
not
what
the
language
of
congress
intends.
informed
consent...
in
this
case,
in
fact,
before
the
hearing
officer
in
texas,
after
mr.
gardner
made
his
appeal,
the
hearing
officer
trotted
out
the
informed
consent
form
that
had
been
signed
by
mr.
gardner.
now,
the
terms
of
that
informed
consent
form
were
as
broad
as
the
attorneys
of
the
department
and
the
physicians
could
possibly
make
it.
the
position
of
the
department
seems
to
be
that
anything
that
is
contained
within
an
informed
consent
form
executed
by
a
patient
in
a
hospital
with
va
medical
personnel
is
not
covered
under
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
your
honor,
i--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--i
think
that
the
difficult
and
close
questions
are
not
to
be
resolved
by
way
of
a
regulation.
the
difficult
and
closed
questions--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--if
it
is
a--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--if
it's
an
injury
that
results
from
surgery
that
creates
an
increased
disability,
that
is
the
test,
and
in
our
view--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--it
would
have
to...
it
would
have
to
be
framed
in
the
context
of
specific
facts
of
a
particular
veteran.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
we
would
consider--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--and
the
consequence
is
an
adverse--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--medical
outcome?
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
congress
intended
to
cover
the
adverse
medical
outcome
of
the
surgery
under
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
your
honor,
our
view
is
it's
not
a
foreseeability
standard,
it
is
a
simple
causal
relationship
between
the
surgery
and
additional
disability.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
if
it
is
an
intended
outcome
that
doesn't
create
an
additional
disability,
which
is
what
we've
hypothesized
here--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--that's
essentially
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
your
honor,
again,
i
will
not
accept
the
notion
that
foreseeability
is
a
proper
test
of
the
clear
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
the
classic
example
that
was
set
forth
by
general
hines
himself
at
the
origin
of
this
statute
in
1924
was
a
circumstance
where
a
veteran
goes
into
a
va
hospital
to
submit
himself
to
a
spinal
tap
for
the
purposes
of
conducting
a
diagnostic
test.
both
today
and
in
1924,
there
is
a
risk,
a
hazard,
in
the
very
words
of
general
hines,
that
that
veteran
may
be
paralyzed
as
a
result
of
that
spinal
tap,
through
absolutely
no
fault
of
medical
personnel.
that
was
an
example
that
was
not
only
cited
by
general
hines,
but
it
was
also
cited
by
other
senators
during
the
1924
consideration
of
this
statute.
that
says
that
the
words
of
congress
mean
that
the
adverse
outcomes
of
surgical
treatment...
your
honor,
i
do
not
care
how
predictable
they
are,
the
adverse
outcomes
of
medical
treatment
under
the
statute
are
contemplated
as
being
covered
and
compensable,
and
in
the
case
of
mr.
gardner--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
do
not
consider
"intended"
to
have
a
foreseeability
concept
to
it.
mr.
gardner
went
into
this
surgery
with
the
expectation
that
his
neurological
pain
would
go
away.
it
was
the
intended
consequence
of
the
surgery
that
that
would
occur.
instead
of
that
occurring,
mr.
gardner
suffered
a
spinal
cord
injury
which
is
permanent.
no
amount
of
surgery
is
going
to
bring
back
to
mr.
gardner
the
use
of
his
legs,
in
this
case.
that
was
not
an
intended
outcome
of
the
surgery.
it
was
undeniably
an
outcome
of
the
surgery.
the
department
has
admitted
it
in
its
supplemental
memorandum
before
the
court
of
veterans
affairs.
mr.
dumont
is
incorrect
when
he
suggests
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
foreseeable
outcome
in
the
case
of
mr.
gardner.
it
is
not.
it
is
an
adverse
outcome,
and
for
them
to
suggest
to
mr.
gardner
that
his
spinal
cord
injury
constitutes
a
usual
and
foreseeable
outcome
of
this
type
of
surgery
is
simply
inappropriate.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
justice
souter,
i
think
that
your
honor's
articulation
of
the
outcome
is
exactly
what
the
words
of
congress
said,
that
if
there
is
an
injury
as
a
result
of
the
surgery
and
it
meets
the
standard
for
compensation
as
an
additional
disability,
it
matters
not
what
was
intended
or
foreseeable.
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
it
is
a
hazard,
and
i
must
say
that--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--yes,
because
it
refers
to
treatment.
i
would
suggest
that--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--i
think
the
statute
on
its
plain
language
would
cover
the
circumstance
that
your
honor
posits
here,
because
we're
talking
about
hospitalization,
medical
or
surgical
treatment,
and
if
the
question
is
whether
the
misdiagnosis
constitutes
one
of
those
predicates,
the
veterans
administration,
the
department,
is
obligated
under
the
statutory
requirement
that
they
broadly
construe
the
acts
of
congress
to
apply
that
analysis
to
the
benefit
of
the
veteran.
in
fact,
under
their
own
regulations
they're
required
to.
so
in
the
situation
that
your
honor
has
hypothesized,
there
would
undoubtedly
be
compensation
under
1151.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
your
honor,
i
really
think
it's
much
simpler
and
ought
to
be
much
simpler,
and
the
reason
why
i
think
it
ought
to
be
much
simpler
is
the
entire
compensation
scheme
for
veterans
presupposes
that
the
veteran
is
entitled
to
benefits
by
virtue
of
his
or
her
status--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--as
a
veteran,
and
a
nexus
in
the
case
of
service-connected
benefits,
a
nexus
between
service
and
a
disability.
in
this
case,
congress
concluded
that
when
a
veteran,
service-connected
or
otherwise,
walks
into
a
veterans
administration
hospital,
congress
is
essentially
saying,
you're
in
the
army
now,
and
as
justice
stevens
indicated
earlier
on,
that
means
that
any
hazards
that
the
veteran,
by
virtue
of
his
status
of
being
in
the
hospital,
gets
exposed
to
in
that
hospital
that
result
in
an
additional
disability,
are
going
to
be
covered.
therefore--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--there
are...
there
are
interpretive
regulations
that
the
department
has
enacted
that
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case
that
mr.
dumont
and
i
agree
do
apply.
one
of
those
regulations
indicates
that
in
comparing
the
condition
of
the
veteran
after
the
surgery...
excuse
me.
in
determining
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question,
the
condition
of
the
veteran
after
the
surgery
as
compared
to
the
condition
of
the
veteran
before
the
surgery.
that's
common
sense--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--i
would
very
much
like
to
adopt
some
type
of
a
regulation
that
provides
foreseeability
to
solve
some
of
these
unexpected
medical
problems
that
we're
talking
about
here,
but
it's...
i
don't
see
it
being
in
the
statute,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--in
358,
my
recollection
is,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
regulation
that
directs
the
hearing
officer,
in
determining
whether
there
is
an
additional
disability,
to
make
a
simple
comparison
between
the
condition
of
the
veteran
after
the
exposure
to
the
predicate
event,
in
this
case
surgery,
and
the
condition
of
the
veteran
before
the
predicate
event.
that
is,
when
he
went
in,
the
condition
the
veteran
was
in
when
he
went
in.
in
the
case
of
our
diabetic,
the
hypothetical
is
that
the
diabetic
goes
into
the
hospital
with
poison
in
the
system
and
requires
the
amputation
of
a
leg.
the
situation
involving
the
removal
of
a
lung
is
obviously,
again,
a
situation
where
the
condition
of
the
veteran
before
hospitalization
is
obviously
a
more
diminished
condition
in
terms
of
earning
capacity
as
opposed
to
the
intended
outcome
of
the
surgery,
and
that
is
the
removal
of
a
lung.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
additional
disability
in
your
honor's
hypothesis.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
i
can
contemplate
a
situation
which
would
require
the
analysis
of
not
just
the
additional
disability
language
but
also
require
an
analysis
of
the
as-a-result-of
language.
is
the
condition
after
surgery
indeed
as
a
result
of
the
surgery?
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
your
honor,
in
their
brief
to
the
court--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--the
board...
the
board
in
its
decision
concluded
in
the
alternative,
that
the--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--post
operative
condition--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
they
did.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
it
was...
that's
correct,
essentially,
a
usual
after-result.
without
proof
of
negligence,
he
can't
recover
for
that.
but
subsequently,
your
honor,
when
i
argued
on
behalf
of
mr.
gardner
as
an
amicus
before
the
court
of
veterans'
appeals,
that
very
finding
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
this
issue
was
factually
ripe
for
a
decision
by
that
court,
and
it
was
argued
by
me
that
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
in
the
record
that
indicated
that
mr.
gardner's
condition
was
as
a
result
of
the
surgery.
there
indeed
had
been
a
medical
examination
by
the
surgeon
that
concluded
that
his
condition,
both
conditions
that
your
honor
referred
to,
were
as
a
result
of
the
surgery,
and
counsel
on
behalf
of
the
department
before
the
court
of
veterans'
appeals
acknowledged
the
case
is
ripe
for
a
decision,
it
turns
only
on
the
regulation,
and
that
mr.
gardner
is,
indeed,
100
percent
disabled
as
a
result
of
the
surgery,
and
that
is
the
record
of
the
case.
we
have
mentioned
this
in
our
brief,
and
mr.
dumont
is
not
familiar
with
those
oral
presentations
at
that
level
of
the
case.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
in
their
opinion
in
this
case,
they
did
not.
they
dealt
exclusively
with
the
fault
issue
as
to
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
they
did
not.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
in
fact,
one
of
the
issues
that
the
court
of
veterans'
appeals
asked
the
va
to
address
was
the
significance
of
the
surgeon's
examination
in
which
the
surgeon's
opinion
was
that
the
condition
was
as
a
result
of
surgery,
and
while
that
issue
was
addressed,
it
did
not
inform
the
decision
of
the
court
of
veterans'
appeals,
and
i
take
it,
quite
frankly,
that
the
department
would
not
have
asked
this
court
to
hear
the
case
if
there
were
a
factual
obstacle
to
reaching
this
particular
decision.
in
our
view,
there
is
no
question
that
mr.
gardner
is
permanently
disabled
as
a
result
of
this
surgery,
and
therefore
ultimately
his
entitlement
to
the
compensation
will
depend
upon
this
court's
decision
about
the
regulation.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
i'm
assuming,
your
honor,
that
there's
evidence
that
the
additional
disability
was
incurred
"as
a
result
of"
surgery.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
language
as--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--i
would
not,
and
it's
because
it's
not
as
a
result
of
the
surgery.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
but
it's--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--i
really--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--i
really
do
think
that
all
of
the
potential
cases
that
can
be
hypothesized
are
amenable
to
a
decision
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
the
hard
case,
the
truly
hard
case
is
taken
care
of
by
another
mechanism
that
is
available
here,
and
that
is,
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals
would
have
to
simply
make
a
factual
determination,
as
we're
discussing
here,
as
to
whether
the
veteran's
condition
meets
these
predicates
for
compensation.
if
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals
in
the
hard
case
makes
a
determination
that
there
is
no
injury
entitled
to
compensation
for
factual
reasons
as
opposed
to
a
regulation
such
as
this,
which
across
the
board
cuts
out
a
whole
group
of
cases,
then
that
factual
determination
is
subject
to
overturn
by
the
court
of
veterans'
appeals
only
on
a
clearly
erroneous
standard,
so
there
is
deference
to
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals
in
the
tough
case
on
a
factual
basis.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
justice
scalia--
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
--well,
here's
my
answer.
what
your
honor
is
inviting
is,
your
honor
is
inviting
a
regulation
like
the
current
regulation,
which
was
not
in
place,
by
the
way,
at
the
time
of
mr.
gardner's
surgery,
and
the
current
regulation
says
that
the
foreseeable
consequences
of
medical
care
and
treatment,
properly
administered,
would
not
entitle
the
veteran
to
compensation
without
a
showing
of
fault.
now,
to
my
mind,
we're
talking
about
foreseeability
in
a
medical
context,
and
that
determination
is
an
unreasonable
one,
makes
no
sense
to
me,
and
cannot
possibly
inform
the
decision
of
the
veterans'
administration
how
to
handle
a
case
on
an
individual
basis.
the
office
of
general
counsel
opinion
which
led
to
that
regulation
dealt
with
exposure
to
hiv
virus
by
virtue
of
receiving
a
blood
transfusion.
the
conclusion
of
the
office
of
general
counsel
was
that
if
the
veteran
received
a
blood
transfusion
before
it
was
known
that
you
could
contract
hiv,
that
was
considered
unforeseeable
and
an
accident,
and
you
get
compensation.
on
the
other
hand,
the
veterans
who
were
exposed
to
hiv,
contracted
it,
and
died
during
the
time
period
when
the
va
knew
that
that
was
a
possibility,
aren't
entitled
to
compensation
under
1151,
and
unless
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
isn't
followed
by
the
va
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
regulations
such
as
this,
and
their
changing
nature
over
the
70
years
that
we've
seen
them,
are
going
to
essentially
deny
veterans
the
benefits
that
congress
said
they
should
have.
different
veterans
with
the
same
condition
at
different
points
in
time
in
the
history
of
the
administration
of
this
statute
would
be
granted
benefits
or
denied
benefits,
depending
upon
the
particular
interpretation
that
the
va
had
of
the
statute
at
that
particular
point
in
time.
congress
has
not
authorized
the
veterans
administration
to
make
such
policy
choices.
rather,
congress
has
said
that
they
must
make
rules
and
regulations
consistent
with
the
laws,
and
the
court
of
veterans'
appeals
has
a
mandate
to
strike
down
those
regulations
which
are
inconsistent
with
the
laws,
and
this
regulation
is
inconsistent
with
the
laws,
and
the
hard
cases
are
taken
care
of
by
the
factual
deference
that
the
court
owes
to
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals.
mr.
joseph
m.
hannon,
jr.
there's
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other.
