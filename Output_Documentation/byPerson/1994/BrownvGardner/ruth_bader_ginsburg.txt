mr.
dumont,
do
we
know
on
the
question
of
numbers,
of
the
unrepresented
claimants,
and
most,
if
not
all,
of
these
were,
what
percentage
prevailed
in
showing
fault
or
accident?
how
many
of
these
claimants
did
this
policy
screen
out?
this
case
was
screened
out,
obviously.
what
struck
me
is,
i
don't
know
of
another
compensation
system
where
an
unrepresented
party
is
required
to
prove
fault.
if
you
know
of
another
compensation
scheme
decided,
in
the
first
instance,
by
an
administrator
where
there
is
no
representation
for
the
claimant
and
yet
the
claimant
has
the
burden
of
showing
fault...
that
seems
to
be
unique.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
burden
is
supposed
to
be
on
the
claimant,
the
unrepresented
claimant,
to
prove
the
fault.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
claimant
loses
unless
fault
is
shown.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
must
make
that
showing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
does
that
screen
out?
is
that
for
people
who
are
alcoholics
or,
what
is
wilful
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
veteran?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
do
the
words
"additional
disability"
mean,
additional
to
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
say
that
there
were
regulations
defining
additional
disability
and
that
you
had
no
disagreement
with
the
veterans
administration
about
those?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dumont,
before
you
get
off
the
veterans
who
didn't
complain
to
congress
that
this
statute
should
have
been
cured,
once
this
problem
surfaced
at
two
judicial
levels,
was
there
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
veterans
administration
to
get
a
clarifying
amendment
to
the
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
response
to
the
federal
circuit
decision.
