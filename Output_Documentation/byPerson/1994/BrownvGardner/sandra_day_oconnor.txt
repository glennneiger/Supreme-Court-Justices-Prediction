justice

day
o'connor
mr.
dumont,
may
i
ask
you,
if
we
agree
with
the
court
below
that
the
statute
just
doesn't
require
the
proof
of
negligence,
you
point
to
examples
such
as,
well,
what
about
the
removal
of
a
lung,
and
that
results
in
shortness
of
breath,
should
that
be
covered
by
the
statute.
does
the
statute
still
contain
an
injury
requirement,
and
is
it
conceivable
that
some
of
the
examples
you
gave
would
just
not
be
injuries
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
quite
apart
from
any
negligence
requirement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
why
i'm
asking
the
question,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
quite
apart
from
any
requirement
of
finding
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
hospital,
there
may
be
other
requirements
in
the
statute
to
be
met
for
coverage.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
line
that
they
had
drawn
was
one
based
on
requirement
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
va.
i
mean,
that
was
how
i
understood
your
argument
to
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
hannon,
how
about
a
back
problem
caused
by
a
disk,
and
before
surgery
the
person
is
so
disabled
because
of
the
pain
that
he's
not
able
to
carry
on
his
normal
work,
and
as
a
result
of
the
surgery,
he
still
has
pain,
and
a
difficulty
with
the
left
foot,
and
can't
do
the
normal
work.
no
recovery.
i
mean,
it's
the
same
disability,
right?
you'd
accept
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
didn't
the
veterans
board
here
decide
in
this
case
that
the
causation
requirement
was
not
met
with
respect
to
the
left
calf
and
the
ankle?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
didn't
the
board
decide
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
you
say
yes
or
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
this
is
getting
kind
of
tangled
up.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
board
made
a
decision
on
causation
and
said,
no
causation
as
to
left
calf
and
ankle.
yes
or
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
and
what's
left
is
the
left
foot
problem,
and
as
to
that,
the
board
said
there
was
causation
there,
but
it
was
a
common,
foreseeable
result.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hannon,
i...
mr.
dumont,
i
thought
the
board
of
veterans
appeals
said
that
the
foot
problems
were
a
common,
foreseeable
result
of
the
surgery.
