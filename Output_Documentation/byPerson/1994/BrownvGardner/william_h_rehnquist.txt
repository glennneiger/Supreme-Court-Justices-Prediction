mr.

from

chief

rehnquist
mr.
hannon,
how
does
this
bear
on
the
question
that's
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
talk
about
some
sort
of
oral
presentations
to
the
court
of
veterans'
appeals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
did
they
deal
with
the
question
of
causation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
what
i
gather
your
description
of
the
representations
were,
it
doesn't
sound
as
though
they
dealt
with
the
question
of
causation,
either.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hannon.
mr.
dumont,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dumont.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
number
93-1128,
brown
v.
gardner.
after
having
back
surgery
at
veterans
administration
facility
the
respondent
gardner
who
is
a
veteran
of
korean
war
experienced
pain
and
weakness
in
his
left
leg.
he
claimed
disability
benefits
under
the
statute
which
requires
the
veterans
administration
to
compensate
veterans
for
an
injury
or
an
aggravation
of
an
injury
that
occurs
as
the
result
of
a
veterans
administration
treatment.
the
va
and
the
board
of
veterans
appeals
denied
gardner's
claim.
on
the
ground
that
subsection
1151
which
is
one
of
the
sections
of
that
law
as
interpreted
by
a
va
regulation.
only
covers
in
injury
if
it
resulted
from
negligent
treatment
by
the
va
or
an
accident
occurring
during
treatment.
the
court
of
veterans
appeals
reversed
holding
that
section
1151
neither
imposes
nor
authorizes
the
adoption
of
the
fault
or
accident
requirement
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
affirmed
that
decision.
in
the
unanimous
opinion
authored
by
justice
souter
and
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
federal
circuit.
the
statute
refer
solely
to
a
claimant's
fault
in
not
permitting
compensation
to
those
whose
disabilities
are
the
result
of
their
own
willful
misconduct
and
without
some
mention
of
a
va's
fault,
it
will
be
unreasonable
to
read
the
statute
as
imposing
on
the
veteran
claimant
the
burden
of
demonstrating
it.
