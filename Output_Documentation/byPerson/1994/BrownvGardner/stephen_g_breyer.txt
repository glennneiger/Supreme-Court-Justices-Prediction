--question
that
you're
on
when
you
were
responding
to
justice
kennedy.
you
do
cover
what
you
call
unforeseen,
untoward
events,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
don't
cover
contemplated,
foreseeable
events
unless
they're
negligent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
complications
that
may
occur
10
percent
of
the
time,
20
percent
of
the
time,
but
say,
normally,
less
than
half
the
time.
that's
an
awful
lot
of
injury,
actually,
and
i
take
it
the
issue
is
whether
you
cover
those,
and
what...
would
it
work
to
have
a
test
which
said,
if
it's
something
bad
that
occurs
more
than
half
the
time,
okay,
that's
part
of
the
treatment,
but
if
it
occurs
sporadically,
or
less
than
half
the
time,
approximately,
then
that's
something
different,
then
you'll
cover
it?
that
seems
to
be
what
the
case
is
about,
that
big
lump
of
things
there
that
occur
not
always,
but
fairly
often.
