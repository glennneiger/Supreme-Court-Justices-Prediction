isn't
it
possible
to
interpret
that
legislative
history
that
you
describe
as
reflecting
an
intent
to
have
the
period
when
the
service-connected
disability
of
a
veteran
is
being
treated
in
hospital
as
though
it
were
treatment
while
he
was
in
service,
and
therefore
whatever
happened
as
a
result
of
that
would
be
sort
of
the
equivalent
to
a
service-connected
disability
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
to
give
a
specific
example
of
the
doctor
does
the
best
he
can
and
without
neglect,
a
general
hines...
that's
quoted
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
consistent
with
the
view
that
they
wanted
to
more
or
less
treat
the
period
when
the
former
serviceman
is
in
the
hospital
as
though
that
was
military
service,
so
that
any
consequences
of
that
would
be
just
as
though
he
had
been
wounded
on
the
battlefield
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
be
clear,
though,
it
has
to
be
sufficiently
freakish
that
it
would
not
have
normally
been
covered
in
the
textbooks
and
that
sort
of
thing?
i
mean,
the
fact
that
it's
just
1
out
of
100
cases
would
not
be
enough
to
make
it
freakish.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
also
not
an
additional
disability,
if
he's
going
to
die
anyway--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--whereas
in
the
case
where
the
amputation
is
improperly
performed,
he's
worse
off
than
he
would
have
been
if
there
had
been
no
operation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
it's
an
additional
disability,
the
other
it's
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
veteran
in
a
private
hospital
wouldn't
fit
into
the
hypothetical
of
being
similar
to
being
someone
in
the
service.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
the
thrust
of
your
argument.
