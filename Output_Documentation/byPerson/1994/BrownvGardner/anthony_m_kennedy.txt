well,
suppose
the
veteran
slips
when
he's...
during,
in
the
recovery
convalescent
period,
because
he
has
a
cast
on,
and
he
slips
and
falls
through
no
fault
of
his
own
and
reinjures
himself,
is
he
covered?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
wilful
misconduct--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
wilful
misconduct
does
not
allow
recovery,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
other
injuries
are
covered,
and
all
other
aggravating
conditions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
dichotomy
the
statute
sets
up.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
but
that
brings
you
back
to
justice
scalia's
question.
what's
the
difference
between
foreseeable
and
unforeseeable?
suppose
there's
an
unexpected
and
very
rare
reaction
to
the
medication,
and
he
has
a
rash
that
creates
some
permanent
disability,
is
that
recoverable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
it
help
you
to
say
that
your
reliance
in
some
instances
on
foreseeability
and
intent
are
relevant
to
determining
whether
or
not
there's
an
additional
disability?
that
is
to
say,
in
the
hypothetical
of
removal
of
a
lung
with
shortness
of
breath,
we
know,
as
a
matter
of
foreseeability,
that
the
person
is
always
going
to
be
disabled
because
of
the
bad
lung,
and
it
is
intended,
and
it
is
foreseeable,
that
there
would
be
shortness
of
breath,
but
we
compare
that
with
what's
intended
and
foreseeable
if
he
had
the
poor
lung,
so,
to
that
extent,
intent
and
foreseeability
do
bear
on
whether
or
not
there's
an
additional
disability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
imports
some
notions
of
foreseeability,
i
take
it.
i'm
simply
trying
to
say
that
your
answers
to
justice
scalia
earlier
with
reference
to
intent
and
what
we
foresee
really
does
have
a
bearing
on
whether
or
not
there
is
an
additional
disability,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
there's
an
injury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
hannon,
do
you
agree
with
the
government
that
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed
there
were
very
few
cases
of
nonservice-connected
disability,
whereas
today
there
are
a
great
many
in
the
veterans'
hospitals?
