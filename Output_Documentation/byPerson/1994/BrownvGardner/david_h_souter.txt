justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
would
expect
them
to
object,
maybe,
if
there
was
a
good
reason
for
them
to
do
so.
one
thing
i
don't
know,
maybe
it's
in
the
briefs
but
i
just
couldn't
get
a
sense
of
it,
is,
what
was
the
percentage
of
these
claims
in
which
the
government's
policy
would
make
a
difference,
because
as
i
understand
it,
if
there
were
treatment
for,
later
treatment
for
a
service-connected
disability,
there
was
no
fault
requirement
at
all,
so
that
the
only
cases
in
which
the
government's
policy,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
would
make
a
difference,
are
those
in
which
there
was
no
prior
service-connected
disability,
and
the
veteran
simply
went
in
because
he
was
sick
or
he
was
hurt
or
what-not.
was
the
percentage
of
these
cases
sufficiently
high
so
that
anyone
would
have
paid
much
attention
to
them?
did...
in
other
words,
i'm
saying
what
practical
difference
did
the
policy
make?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
the
early
years
we
just
don't
know.
prior,
for
example,
to
the,
what
was
it,
the
'34
amendment,
we
don't
know
what
the
substantiality
of
this
effect
would
have
been
in
that
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
a
separate
issue.
i
mean,
you
can
come
to
that
conclusion
and
still
say
that
when
recovery
is
required,
it
is
a
nonfault-based
system.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
a
further
textual
element
that
you're
leaving
out,
and
that
is,
there's
a
provision
in
there
specifically
referring
to
the
fault
of
the
claimant,
so
that
there
is
on
the
face
of
the
text
an
expression
of
consciousness
of
fault,
but
it
was
expressed
only
with
respect
to
the
claimant.
justice
david
h.
souter
even
if
that
intent
is
based
on
negligent
advice?
in
other
words,
might
there
be
a
case
in
which
you
want
to
depend
on
negligence
to
get
out
of
this
particular
analytical
framework.
justice
david
h.
souter
just
an--
justice
david
h.
souter
--argument.
so,
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
would
still
have
to
prove
the
negligence
in
order
to
prove,
i
suppose,
that
this
was
something
other
than
the
usual
informed
consent
case.
you
say
the
reason
it's
not
an
informed
consent
case
is
that
we
got
negligent
advice.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
hannon,
would
it
be
easier
for
you,
and
perhaps
for
us,
if
we
drew
this
distinction,
the
distinction
between
the
consequences,
simply
as
a
straight
matter
of
factual
causation,
of
appropriate
medical
procedures
and,
on
the
other
hand,
the
imposition
of
inappropriate
medical
procedures?
in
your
case,
you're
not
claiming
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
have
disk
surgery.
what
you're
claiming
is
that
there
was
a
consequence
of
the
disk
surgery,
and
you
should
not
be
required
to
prove
fault
in
order
to
establish
how
that
consequence
occurred
in
the
course
of
what,
in
the
abstract
at
least,
was
a
perfectly
appropriate
procedure,
some
disk
surgery.
whereas,
some
of
the
questions
that
are
being
presented
to
you,
and
some
of
the
hypotheticals
that
are
being
raised,
are
hypotheticals
about
procedures
which
are
not
warranted
at
all.
if
i've
got
a
scratch
in
my
leg,
it
is
not
an
appropriate
procedure
simply
to
amputate
my
leg.
if
i
have
gangrene
which
cannot
be
controlled,
it
is.
wouldn't
you
be
on
easier
ground
if
you
said,
look,
the
only
case
that
i'm
worried
about
here,
and
the
only
case
which
perhaps
the
regs
were
intended
to
address,
is
the
case
in
which
the
procedure
is
appropriate,
but
something
goes
wrong
in
the
course
of
it,
there
is
a
consequence,
whether
it
be
unexpected,
merely,
or
negligent
in
fact,
and
we
don't
have
to
prove
fault
in
order
to
get
compensation
for
that
consequence?
would
that
be
a
satisfactory
position
for
you,
and
would
it
be
a
possible
reading
of
the
reg?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
ask
you,
then,
do
you
think
the
regulation
addresses
the
case
of
the
procedure
which
is
totally
inappropriate,
the
procedure
which
is
totally
the
result
of
negligence?
i
scratch
my
leg,
and
the
va
says
we'll
have
to
take
it
off.
does
the
reg
address
that...
i'm
sorry,
the
statute
address
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
we've
got
to...
the
statute
is
all
or
nothing.
is
the
distinction
that
i'm
making
a
legitimate
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
his
case
is
easier
in
one
respect
if
you
take...
than
the
one
i'm
going
to
put.
if
you
take
the
instance
of
the
leg
that
comes
off,
if
the
veteran
could
walk
into
the
hospital
to
have
the
operation
and
he
then
loses
the
leg,
obviously
there's
an
additional
disability
there.
and
yet,
if
the
testimony,
if
the
conclusion
were
that
he
would
have
died
without
the
removal
of
the
leg,
you
would
not
claim
that
he
should
be
compensated
for
disability,
whereas
if
the
conclusion
were
that
he
would
have
been
perfectly
fine
if
the
leg
had
been
left
on,
you
would
claim
for
disability.
so
you're
claiming
something
more
than
the
mere
factual
foreseeability
of
the
consequence
of
the
operation.
you're
assuming
something
about
the
appropriateness
of
what
was
done
to
him,
aren't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
as
a
result
of
it
factually.
he
couldn't
walk
because
he
lost
his
leg.
there's
clear
factual
causation,
but
if,
in
fact,
it
were
accepted
as
a
conclusion
that
he
would
have
died
without
the
loss
of...
without
the
amputation,
you
would
not
claim
that
that
was
a
compensable
injury.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you?
you
wouldn't
be
claiming
that
that
was
a
compensable
consequence,
would
you?
