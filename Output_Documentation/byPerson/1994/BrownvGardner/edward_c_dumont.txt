mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
38
u.s.
code
section
1151,
which
provides
so-called
service-connected
disability
benefits
to
veterans
who
have
suffered
an
injury
not,
in
fact,
as
a
result
of
their
military
service
but
as
the
result
of
hospitalization
or
medical
care
provided
by
the
veterans
administration.
during
the
statute's
70-year
history
of
enactment,
implementation,
repeal,
reenactment,
recodification,
and
periodic
amendment,
the
va
has
consistently
held
that
section
1151
does
not
authorize
the
extension
of
benefits
for
disabilities
arising
as
a
reasonably
foreseeable
consequence
of
properly
rendered
medical
care.
rather--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
however,
we
would
point
out
that
in
addition
to
that
fact,
or
precisely
because
of
that
fact,
it's
well-known
that
the
veterans
committees
of
congress
have
always
taken
a
very
active
interest
in
the
administration
of
veterans
affairs.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
although
we
think
there
is
quite
a
remarkable
record
of
consistency
in
that
regard,
since
there
was
a
good
deal
of
administration
in
the
twenties,
shortly
after
the
enactment,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
administration
in
the
thirties,
after
the
reenactment,
and
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
ongoing
administration
during
the
subsequent
period...
so
we
believe
really
that
the
evidence
that
congress
has
over
all
of
those
years
expressed
no
dissatisfaction,
in
fact
no
one
in
congress,
no
one
else,
to
our
knowledge,
has
expressed
any
great
dissatisfaction
with
the
core
interpretation
of
section
1151
not
to
provide
benefits
for
the
ordinary,
foreseeable
results
of
proper
medical
care--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--we
would
expect
the
veterans
and
the
committee
to
object
if
they
thought
that
the
veterans
administration
was
applying
too
narrow
a
construction
of
the
statute,
which
is
the
claim
that
the
respondent
makes
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
it
makes
quite
a
significant
practical
difference,
actually.
i'm
not
aware
of
the
figures
from
the
very
early
period.
however,
now
i
can
tell
you
that
a
very
substantial
proportion
of
the
care
rendered
by
the
va,
both
hospitalization
and
out-patient
medical
care,
is
rendered
to
veterans
whose
disability
is
nonservice-connected,
or
whose
condition
is
a
nonservice-connected
condition,
and
therefore--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
correct.
i'm
not
aware
of...
well,
of
course,
until
1924,
by
and
large
veterans
with
nonservice-connected
disabilities
were
not
entitled
to
care
at
all,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
think
it's
implausible
to
accept
respondent's
contention
that
section
1151
in
its
original
incarnation
was
intended
to
somehow
put
nonservice-connected
veterans
on
a
par
with
service-connected
veterans,
because
really
they
were
quite
separate
questions.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i'm
not
aware
of
another
system
that
has
this
structure,
but
i
think
the
entire
system
of
veterans'
benefits
is
unique,
but
part
of
what's
unique
about
it
is
that
it
is
meant
to
be
nonadversarial
at
the
initial
stages,
and
i
think
there
is
really
no
evidence...
despite
the
allegations
from
respondent,
there's
no
evidence
that
the
claims
adjudicators
at
the
va
don't
do
a
proper
job
of
trying
to
develop
the
facts
of
these
cases
when
they're
presented
and
try
to
figure
out
whether
there
was
fault
on
the
part
of
the
va,
or
some
fault
that
comes
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
that's
not...
not
really
true.
at
the
administrative
stage,
by
statute
all
factual
questions
are
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
claimant,
and
it's
not
really
a
question
of
who
has
the
burden.
the
claimant
is
supposed
to
come
to
the
veterans
administration,
and
the
veterans
administration
has
an
obligation
to
help
the
claimant
develop
the
facts
of
that
claim,
so
it's
really
an
objective
investigation
process
which
the
va
people
are
perfectly
capable
of
implementing,
and
there's
no
evidence
they're
not
implementing
it
correctly.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the
plaintiff
cannot...
the
claimant
cannot
require...
recover
benefits
unless
there
is
some
showing
of
fault
or
an
accident
within
the
meaning
of
the
regulations,
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it
must
be...
it
must
be
made
on
behalf
of
the
claimant,
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
certainly
think
that
that's--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
certainly
think
that
that
is
conceivable.
we
think
that,
as
we've
said
in
our
brief,
that
the
term
"injury"
as
used
in
this
particular
statute
has
room
for
interpretation,
and
that
what
congress
was
thinking
about
when
they
passed
this
statute
was
not
the
ordinary,
foreseeable
result
of
proper
medical
care,
which
is
all
we
are
talking
about
here.
remember,
the
respondent
came
to
the
va
with
a
herniated
disk
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
military
service.
he
received
a
perfectly
proper
operation.
there's
no
contention
that
the
care
was
improper,
and
he
experienced,
apparently,
a
common
and
foreseeable
result
of
that
surgery,
which
is
some
weakness
of
dorsiflexion
in
the
left
foot.
now,
the
question
is,
when
congress
passed
this
whole
scheme,
as
they've
watched
it
be
administered
over
the
years,
did
they
really
intend
to
extend
not
only
the
benefit
of
free
care
to
an
indigent
veteran,
which
is
what
happened
here,
for
a
nonservice-connected
disability,
but
also
a
lifetime
of
disability
compensation
benefits
for
a
perfectly
foreseeable
result
of
the
proper
care
he
received?
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
we
think
that's
quite
right.
the
veteran
has
to
suffer
an
injury,
and
we
don't
think...
we
think
it's
perfectly
acceptable
for
the
veterans
administration
to
say
that
within
the
context
of
this
statute
you
do
not
suffer
an
injury
when
you
get
the
care
that
you
were
entitled
to,
it
was
proper
care,
and
all
that
happens
is
that
you
have
some
common,
foreseeable
side
effect
of
that
care.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
yes.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
and
that,
of
course,
is
the
normal
case
and
the
case
we
have
here,
but--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--the
argument
we're
making,
justice
scalia,
is
this:
the
statute
was
intended
to
cover...
let
me
back
up,
if
i
may
for
a
minute,
to
1924,
and
what
was
the
situation
in
1924.
since
1917,
the
va
had
provided
hospitalization
and
medical
care
benefits
for
veterans
with
service-connected
disabilities,
and
that
left
a
gap,
a
perceived
gap
in
the
coverage
of
the
statute.
the
va
felt
that
its
authority
to
compensate
for
the
foreseeable
result
of
the
injury
would
cover
the
normal
results
of
medical
care,
but
it
did
not
feel
that
it
would
cover
something
where
an
intervening
cause
had
come
along
in
the
form
of
malpractice
by
a
va
physician
or
some
particularly
unforeseeable
thing
that
happened
while
the
veteran
was
under
va
care,
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
it
proposed
the
statute
in
1924.
that's...
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
materials,
what
they
are
talking
about
is,
congress,
we
have
to
fix
this
statute
because
there
are
a
limited
number
of
cases
where
we
have
a
veteran
who
comes
in
and
there's
no
current
statutory
authority
to
compensate
for
cases
of
malpractice
or
error
in
judgment
and
so
on.
now,
they
therefore
passed
section
213,
which
is
now
section
1151.
now,
we
know
that
that
was
not
intended
to
address
the
question
of
nonservice-connected
veterans
because
there
was
no
treatment
for
nonservice-connected
veterans,
with
limited
exceptions,
before
that,
and
we
know
that
it
could
not
have
been
intended
exclusively
to
address
the
cases
of
examinations,
where
somebody
might
be
examined,
be
injured,
and
then
be
found
not
to
have
a
service-connected
condition.
that
was
a
set
of
cases.
but
congress
didn't
focus
exclusively
on
that,
because
in
fact
they
had
to
amend
the
statute
in
1925
to
cover
those
cases.
so
what
we're
left
with,
as
a
matter
of
detection,
is
saying,
what
was
congress
getting
at?
what
they
were
getting
at
is
these
cases
of
service-connected
veterans
who
were
injured
under
care
of
the
va
in
some
way
that
was
not
considered
to
be
a
proximate
cause
of
their
service-connected
injury,
and
that
was
either
for
one...
it
was
for
one
of
two
reasons,
either
because
there
was
intervening
negligence
on
the
part
of
some
va
agent,
or
because
something
simply
freakish
happened,
something
that
was
completely
unforeseeable.
what
it
was
never
intended
to
cover
is
the
ordinary
results
of
care.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
we
don't
think
so,
and
we
don't
think
so
because
the
question
is,
what
would
congress
have
intended
when
it
was
extending
these
benefits,
and
it's
perfectly
plausible
that
they
intended
to
cover
a
veteran
for
anything
that
happened
as
a
result
of
government
fault.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
that
statement
from
the
legislative
history
is
inconsistent
with
our
view,
and
i
think
we
have
to
say
that,
reading
the
legislative
history
as
a--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--one
could
take
that
view,
but
i
suggest
that
by
reading
the
entire
legislative
history
and
thinking
about
what
congress
would
have
had
in
mind,
that
would
be
an
unlikely
conclusion
to
reach,
because
it
is
simply
not
plausible
that
congress,
when
they
were
extending
benefits
in
1924,
thought
that
what
they
were
doing
was
saying,
not
only
are
we
going
to...
well,
remember
that
they
were
thinking
about
service-connected
veterans
in
the
first
place.
there
was
a
separate
issue
about
nonservice-connected
veterans.
but
in
1924
they
thought,
we
will
liberalize
the
system.
we
will
extend
care
to
nonservice-connected
veterans
on
a
relatively
general
basis,
but
it's
not
very
plausible
to
me
that
they
thought
what
they
were
doing
when
they
extended
that
limited
hospitalization
benefit
was
to
say
we
will
pick
up
the
tab
for
the
original
care
for
your
nonservice-connected
condition
plus
a
lifetime
disability
bill
for
anything
that
happens
that
really
is
a
result
not
of
your
care
but
of
that
condition.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
let
me
focus
on
that.
we
think
the
language
that's
key
here
as
to
that
point
is
the
language,
as
a
result
of,
and
that
language...
respondent
would
have
the
court
interpret
that
language
as
plain
on
its
face,
to
mean
nothing
more
than
factual
causation,
but
i
think
that's
not
only
inconsistent
with
some
of
this
court's
precedents
in
the
antitrust
area,
which
we
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
halmers
v.
sipc
being
the
obvious
example.
but
it's
inconsistent
with
common
sense.
i
mean,
when
you
have
a
statute
where
you--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
true,
but
i
think
it,
with
respect...
that
it
is
of
limited
significance,
because
that
exclusion
for
fault
of
the
claimant
is
one
that
runs
throughout
the
entire
gamut
of
veterans'
benefits
statutes.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it
could
be
a
variety
of
things.
it
could
be
self-injury,
it
could
be...
in
many
cases
in
the
early
days,
it
was
sexually
transmitted
diseases
which
were
considered
misconduct
diseases
and
were
not
covered.
it
might
be
a
veteran
who
got
in
a
fight
while
in
the
va
hospital
and
injured
himself,
or
didn't
take--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i
think
that
would
depend
on,
if
it's
through
no
fault
of
his
own
and
there
is
no
suggestion
there
is
any
fault
on
the
part
of
the
veterans
administration
in
the
conditions
that
gave
rise
to
the
accident,
then
it
would
really
be
a
question
of
whether
that
was
an
accident,
something
simply
unforeseeable
that
might
have
happened,
and
in
that
case
he
would
recover.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
now,
if
he
was
at
fault,
or
if
va
was
at
fault--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i
really
don't
think
so,
and
i
think
one
can
interpret
the
language--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
one
could
interpret
the
statute
very
broadly
to
be
any
factual
cause
except
for
wilful
misconduct,
or
one
can
interpret
those
same
words,
i
think
quite
plausibly,
to
draw
a
line
that
says,
look,
what
is
this
as
a
result
of?
you
have
some
further
disability.
is
that
as
a
result
of
your
medical
care,
or
is
it
as
a
result
of
the
original
condition
you
walked
in
the
hospital
with?
and
our
position
is
that
any
kind
of
foreseeable,
common
side
effect
of
treatment
is
a
result
of
the
condition
you
walked
in
the
hospital
with,
and
not
a
result
of
the
treatment
you
received
from
the
veterans
administration.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
case
that
would
normally
be
covered
under
the
accident
definition
of
the
regulations.
it's
something
that's
simply
unforeseeable.
it's
not
the
veteran's
fault,
it's
not
a
normal
result
of
the
condition
or
the
treatment,
it's
not
really
the
fault
of
the
va,
but
it's
something
that
happened
while
you
were
under
va
care,
and
the
government
has
chosen
to
accept
responsibility
for
that.
and
i...
with
respect,
i
think
that's
the
key
point
here.
what
we're
looking
for
is
what
has
congress
chosen
to
accept
responsibility
for
in
the
case
of
these
veterans,
and
again,
i
would
suggest
that
it's
not
plausible
that
they
have
chosen
to
accept
responsibility
for
the
ordinary
consequences
of
properly
rendered
medical
care.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
certainly
think
that's...
that's
essentially
what
we're
arguing,
and
we'd
be
perfectly
happy
to
express
it
that
way
as
opposed
to,
through
negligence.
in
fact,
focusing
on
negligence
is,
we
think,
erroneous,
because
the
standard
has
never
really
required
the
same
kind
of
proof
that
you
would
have
in
a
tort
case
in
the
civil
context.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
that
might
be
a
possible
line
that
the
va
could
have
drawn
in
interpreting
the
statute,
because
we
think
that
the
words,
"as
a
result
of",
give
plenty
of
leeway
for
deciding
what
it
was
that
congress
was
getting
at.
the
fact
is,
the
va
has
drawn
a
somewhat
different
line,
a
somewhat
more
conservative
line,
which
is
to
say,
at
the
5
or
10
percent
level,
if
this
is
something
that
if
you
open
the
textbook
of
medicine
and
said,
you're
going
to
have
this
operation
and
here
are
the
possible
side
effects.
or
to
look
at
it
in
another
way,
if
this
is
something
you
would
be
considered
to
have
consented
to
as
a
matter
of
informed
consent
when
you
underwent
the
treatment
in
the
first
place,
then
that
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
meant
to
cover
as
a
disability
matter
under
the
statute.
so
that's
the
line
that
va
has
drawn.
we
think
it's
a
reasonable
line,
and
we
think
it's
entitled
to
deference
from
the
courts.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the
case
most
often
comes
up
in
a
posture
of
somebody...
of
the
question
being,
was
there
fault
or
not
fault,
and
that's
most
often
thought
of
in
terms
of
negligence
of
care
versus
nonnegligence
of
care.
but
it's
in
fact
a
little
bit
broader
than
that.
it's
any
kind
of
demonstrated
fault
or
error
in
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
people
at
the
va,
or
any
kind
of
simply
freakish,
unforeseeable
accident
that
might
occur,
that
the
government
is
willing
to
accept
responsibility
for,
because
after
all
you
were
under
va
care
when
it
happened,
and
that
seems
to
be
a
reasonable
line,
giving
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the
veteran.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct,
and
i
think,
you
know,
one
good
example
of
that
is
the
recent
reconsideration
of
the
accident
definition
in
the
case
of
blood
transfusions
in
the
early
1980's
that
might
have
transmitted
the
hiv
virus.
in
those
cases,
it
was
determined
that
up
to
a
certain
point
it
was
really
just
not
foreseeable
to
anybody
that
was
a
way
you
could
get
hiv,
and
those,
therefore,
were
covered,
those
cases.
but
when
it
became
foreseeable,
then
there
was
merely
a
question
of
negligence
or
consent.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
your
honor.
to
return
just
briefly,
justice
ginsburg,
to
your
question
about...
and
perhaps
this
is
also
your
question,
justice
stevens,
about
numbers,
what
i
can
tell
you
is,
on
page
35
of
our
brief
at
note
20
we
point
out
that
in
1933,
when
the
statute,
after
all,
had
just
been
repealed,
there
were
66,000
admissions
to
va
hospitals
for
nonservice-connected
conditions,
whereas
in
1934,
when
senator
steiwer
was
arguing
for
reenactment
of
this
provision,
what
he
said
was,
there
might
be
65
or
67
people
who
were
affected
by
reenacting
section
213.
that
has
two
significances.
one
is,
there
were
quite
a
few
people
out
there
who
presumably
had
some
bad
consequence
of
care
who
were
not
getting
benefits,
and
one
might
have
thought
that
they
would
bring
this
to
the
attention
of
congress
if
that
was
wrong,
and
the
second
is
that
there
were
simply
not
very
many
people
who
were
being
granted
benefits
under
this
statute
when
congress
reenacted
it
in
1934,
and
that
gives
us
some
idea
of
what
scope
they
had
in
mind
when
they
reenacted
it.
justice
stevens,
you
had
asked
about
why
one
shouldn't
interpret
the
statute--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
believe
there
was
an
attempt
to
get
the
statute
amended.
i
don't
believe
it
eventuated
in
anything.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
believe
that
the
va
made
a
legislative
proposal,
but
certainly
nothing
was
enacted.
justice
stevens,
you
asked
about
the
sort
of
you're-in-the-army-now
hypothetical,
as
mr.
hannon
put
it.
we
think
the
case
of
somebody
who's
in
the
army
is
really
quite
different
from
somebody
who's
in
the
hospital.
congress
has
made
the
choice
explicitly
in
a
statute
to
say
that
anyone...
in
the
line
of
duty
has
been
interpreted
very
broadly
to
mean
anything
that
happens
to
you
while
you
are
physically
in
the
service.
in
the
hospital,
we
don't
think
congress
would
have
had
any
reason
to
adopt
the
same
kind
of
view
and,
in
fact,
that's
pointed
up
by
the
anomaly
that
respondent's
position
creates.
if
you
have
a
veteran
with
exactly
the
same
condition
who
goes
to
a
private
hospital
and
receives
exactly
the
same
care,
has
exactly
the
same
result,
he
will
not
be
entitled
to
any
benefits
under
1151
because
it
wasn't
va
care,
and
it's
odd
that
congress
would
have
had
in
mind
having
very
different
benefits
regimes
for
veterans
who
are
really
in
very
much
the
same
position,
unless
you
think
they
had
in
mind
something--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--but
again,
the
question
is--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
again,
the
question
is,
what
is
it
that
congress
would
reasonably
be
thought
to
have
taken
responsibility
for,
and
i
think
they
would
have
taken
responsibility
for
a
range
of
circumstances
that
are
much
the
same
as
those
that
would
have
given
rise
to
recovery
in
the
private
hospital
setting.
again,
you
can
make
that...
you
can
see
that
even
more
clearly
by
the
fact
that
many
of
these
people,
especially
in
the
early
days,
were
entitled
to
care
only
on
a
space-available
basis,
so
you
might
very
well
have
had
a
veteran
with
a
nonservice-connected
disability
who
was
turned
away
from
a
va
hospital
only
because
there
was
no
space,
went
to
a
private
hospital,
he
not
only
has
to
pay
for
his
care
now,
he
doesn't
get
these
disability
benefits,
when
in
fact
the
care
he
received
was
identical
and
was
perfectly
proper
in
both
cases.
we
think
that's
quite
anomalous.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
there
were
really
three
sort
of
claimed
additional
disabilities,
two
of
them
the
board
quite
clearly
found
bore
no
factual
relationship
to
the
surgery.
the
third
one,
which
was
the
left
foot,
they
simply
said
that
there
was
no
negligence.
that's
the
way
they
disposed
of
the
case,
and
they
didn't
ever
reach
the
question
of--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
you
could
articulate
the
rule
exactly
the
way
you
did,
and
it
might
have
to
be
remanded
back
to
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals
for
further
factual
findings
to
see
how
that
test
would
be
applied
here,
although
i
think
the
natural
assumption
would
be
that
if
there
was
no
negligence
then
what
they
said
was,
look,
this
was
a
common,
foreseeable
result
of
this
surgery,
and
if
that's
true,
then
we
win
under
both
bases.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
they
said
they
were
a
common,
foreseeable
result
of
the
surgery,
and
there
was
no
indication
of
any
kind
of
fault
on
the
part
of
va.
they're
really
two
sides
of
the
same
coin,
i
think.
so
one
could
either
read
their
opinion
to
have
made
a
definitive
finding
on
that
issue
and
we
win
hands-down,
or
one
could
read
it
to
leave
open
some
room
for
foreseeability
analysis
that
hasn't
taken
place
and
remand
it
back,
but
i'm
quite
confident
what
the
result
would
be
based
on
their
opinion.
just,
in
quick
closing,
we
think
that
the
discussion
with
mr.
hannon
has
clearly
demonstrated
our
fundamental
point
here,
which
is
that
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not,
on
its
face,
resolve
this
question.
the
as-a-result-of
language,
the
injury
language,
leave
plenty
of
room
for
interpretation.
and
when
we
get
down
to
questions
like,
is
it
100
percent,
or
75
percent,
or
50
percent,
or
5
percent
where
one
draws
a
foreseeability
line,
that
is
classically
the
kind
of
decision
that
ought
to
be
left
in
the
hands
of
the
administrative
agency
that
has
been
committed
by
congress
with
the
task
of
interpreting
the
statute
and
administering
it,
and
i
think
that
the
va
has
done
a
perfectly
reasonable
job
here,
the
courts
below
failed
to
defer,
and
this
court
should
correct
that
error.
thank
you.
