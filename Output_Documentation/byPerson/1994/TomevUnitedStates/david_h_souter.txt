the
grammar's
against
you,
isn't
it?
if
we
were
to
read
it
the
way
you,
you
were
reading
it
to
start
with
in
such
a
way
that
the
word
recent
modifies
not
only
fabrication
but
influence
or
motive.
that's
correct,
isn't
it...
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
the
natural
way,
if
that
were
the
intent,
to...
the
modifier
recent
apply
to
all
three,
wouldn't
the
natural
way
to
write
it
have
been
recent
fabrication,
comma,
improper
influence
or
motive?
but
you've
got
an
extra
or
in
there
which
suggests
to
me
at
least
that
recent
refers
to
fabrication
but
not
necessarily
to
the
others
in
the
series.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
reason
it
was
put
into
the
rule
may
be
that
it
was
intended
simply
to
modify
fabrication.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
about
the
retention
of
the
common
law
rule
is
an
argument
that
has
pretty
much
got
to
rest
on
things
like
the
failure
to
note
that
they
were
in
this
respect
revising
the
common
law,
or
the
rejection
of
the
weinstein
approach,
et
cetera,
as
opposed
to
the
grammar,
because
it
seems
to
me
the
grammar
is
a
problem
for
you
unless
you
can
explain
it
otherwise
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
find
that
recent
modified
simply
fabrication,
do
you
lose
the
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
can
you
walk
me
through
the
rule?
if
recent
fabrication
doesn't
help
you,
are
you
then
admitting
the
testimony
to
rebut
an
improper
influence?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
wallace,
may
i
ask
you
before
you
go
further
to
say
a
word
about
the
grammar
on
the
question
whether
the
adjective
recent
does
modify
anything
other
than
fabrication?
when
i
asked
your
opposing
counsel
that
question,
i
said
that
it
seemed
odd
that
if
recent
was
intended
to
modify
improper
influence
or
motive,
that
there
simply
wasn't
a
comma
after
the
word
fabrication,
and
justice
stevens
and
i
have
been
having
an
exchange
of
notes,
and
one
of
the
things
that
has
come
up,
and
i
think
your
brother
perhaps
suggested
it,
too,
is
that
if
the
further
modifier,
improper,
modifies
both
influence
and
motive,
and
that
seems
to
be
the
accepted
view,
that
would
be
a
reason
for
putting
the
word
or
after
fabrication.
do
you
think
that
may
be
the
answer,
so
that
the
grammar
perhaps
is
at
best
ambiguous
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
which
point,
the
first
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
rescues
it
from
mere
cumulativeness
is
the
time
differential,
isn't
that
so?
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
wallace,
your
position
is
that
the
rule
as
written
has
the
same
meaning
as
if
it
said,
consistent
with
the
declarant's
testimony,
and
lends
credibility
to
that
testimony.
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
wallace,
isn't
every
charge
of
lying
implicitly
a
charge
that
one
is
lying
for
an
improper
motive?
i
mean,
within
the
context
of
courts,
we
don't
recognize
proper
motives
for
lying,
so
it
picks
it
all
up.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
unless
the
police
make
it
clear,
unless
the
cross-examiner
makes
it
clear
that
that's
where
he's
putting
the
blame,
or
unless
the
cross-examiner
says,
i
certainly
do
not
suggest
that
mr.
so-and-so
has
an
improper
reason
for
doing
it,
he's
just
mistaken,
unless
the
implicit
objection
is
couched
in
that
way,
it
would
be
fair,
usually,
to
take
the
kind
of
attack
through
cross-examinations,
attack
on
veracity,
and
therefore
there
would
be
an
implicit
imputation
of
motive.
