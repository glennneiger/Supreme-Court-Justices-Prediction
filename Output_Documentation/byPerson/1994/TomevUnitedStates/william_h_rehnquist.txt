chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
63-6892,
matthew
wayne
tome
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
gandert.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it's
inconsistent
with
the
plain
language
of
the
rule.
you
don't
question
that
the
statement
was
offered
to
rebut,
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
that
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let's
go
through
the
language
phrase
by
phrase.
the
testimony
has
to
be,
is
offered
to
rebut
an
express
or
implied
charge
against
the
declarant
of
recent
fabrication
or
improper
influence
or
motive.
now,
it
doesn't
say
it
has
to
rebut.
it
says
it's
offered
to
rebut.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
court
has
to
make
a
decision
and
then
the
jury
has
to
make
the
same
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
all
sorts
of
evidentiary
rulings
it's
a
question
of
relevancy.
the
trial
judge
says,
yes,
this
could
be
of
use
to
the
juror.
a
reasonable
juror
might
be
helped
by
this.
the
trial
judge
doesn't
say,
if
i
were
the
fact-finder
i
would
be
persuaded
by
it.
why
shouldn't
the
same
rule
apply
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
simply
froze
the
common
law
in
place?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
rules
have
also
been
interpreted
to
mean
that
they
have
liberalized
admissibility
of
evidence,
that
that
was
one
of
their
purposes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
the
only
change
that
the
advisory
committee's
notes
mention.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
rule
speaks
in
terms
of,
in
such
a
way
that
grammatically
it
seems
that
the
word
recent
modifies
only
the
word
fabrication
and
not
the
word
improper
influence
or
motive,
doesn't...
and
if
you're
correct
about
the
common
law,
doesn't
that
suggest
that
this
rule
differs
from
the
common
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
i
don't
think
the
committee
operated
like
it
was
said
congress
did
in
the
last
case.
i
mean,
if
you
read
subsection
(b),
it
seems
to
me
quite
precise...
"consistent
with
the
declarant's
testimony
and
is
offered
to
rebut
an
express
or
implied
charge
against
the
declarant
of
recent
fabrication
or
improper
influence
or
motive.
"
now,
that's
all
internally
consistent
and,
really,
i
think
for
the
reasons
justice
souter
stated,
it
hurts
you,
because
recent
doesn't
modify
the
words
improper
influence
or
motive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
we
should
simply
ignore
the
language
of
the
rule
and
revert
to
the
common
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
answer
that
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gandert.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
think
it
would
make
much
sense
to
read
the
word
recent
as
modifying
the
phrase,
improper
influence,
that
what
they're
concerned
with
is
a
recent...
only
with
a
recent
improper
influence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
gandert,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gandert.
the
case
is
submitted.
