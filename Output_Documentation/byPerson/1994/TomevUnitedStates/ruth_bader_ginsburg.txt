what
you've
just
said
indicates
that
you're
modifying
what
you
said
earlier.
that
is,
you've
made
the
flat
statement,
it
would
not
have
come
in,
and
now
you've
just
mentioned
that,
well,
it
might
well
have
come
in
under
a
different
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
would
make
this
whole
thing
academic,
right,
if
it
could,
at
least
the
three
pediatricians...
were
they
pediatricians
+/?
could
come
in
under
803(4),
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
of
it
might
come
in
under
the
catch-all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
trial
judge
seemed
to
have
some
confusion
about
whether
it
would
come
in,
would
have
to
have
a
limiting
instruction
that
it
would
be
hearsay,
that
hearsay
somehow,
even
if
it
fell
under
an
exception,
wasn't
admissible
for
all
purposes,
it
would
have
to
be
admitted...
it
was
very
confusing,
i
thought.
maybe
you
could
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
this.
if
something
falls
under
a
hearsay
exception,
then
it
comes
in
as
evidence
and
you
don't
need
to
have
a
limiting
instruction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then,
why
does
rebut
have
to
mean
totally
demolished?
why
can't
rebut,
or
doesn't,
isn't
the
common
understanding
of
rebut
mean
to
weaken,
to
offset,
to
have
some
effect
to
weaken
the
testimony
that
you
are
attempting
to
offset?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
never
knew
it
was
traditional
to
say
to
rebut
means
you
have
to
totally
demolish,
bowl
over,
that
it
would
be
enough
to
weaken
the
force
of
opposing
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now
you're
backing
off
the
stress
on
the
word
rebut
and
going
back
to
the
terms
of
the
exceptions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
doesn't
that
suggest
that
the
trial
judge
should
have
let
it
in
under
the
catch-all?
then
you
wouldn't
have
any
problems
about
limiting
it
to
rebuttal,
and
it
could
come
in
without
any
restrictions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well--
--mr.
wallace,
do
i
gather
what
you're
saying
is
it
was
more
likely
under
the
circumstances
of
telling
the
doctor
or
the
babysitter
that
she
was
not
lying
in
that
setting
than
it
was
likely
when
she
said
it
on
the
stand?
is
that--
