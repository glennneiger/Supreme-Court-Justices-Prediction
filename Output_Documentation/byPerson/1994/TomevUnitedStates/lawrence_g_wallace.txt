mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
one
directly
addressed
by
a
specific
provision
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
rule
801(d)(1)(b),
which
is
set
forth
in
respondent's
brief,
the
blue
brief,
on
the
very
first
page
following
the
table
of
authorities.
the
court
of
appeals
properly
resolved
this
case
under
this
rule,
which
was
the
narrowest
ground
of
decision
available
to
it,
because
under
this
rule,
the
evidence
was
admissible
if
it
were
offered
to
rebut
a
charge
of
fabrication,
whereas
under
the
other
rules
that
were
considered
in
the
district
court,
the
evidence
would
have
been
admissible
more
broadly
regardless
of
whether
there
had
been
a
charge
of
fabrication
by
the
witness,
so
the
court
of
appeals
properly
chose
to
address
only
the
narrowest
ground
for
decision
rather
than
the
rule
803(4)
or
803(24)
ground.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
district
court
relied
on
this
ground
as
well.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
we
certainly
would
argue
that
it
was
admissible
on
the
other
grounds.
there
were
contentions
that
the
803(4),
the
admissibility
of
hearsay
offered
for
medical
treatment,
would
be
admissible
only
if
the
issue
were
the
propriety
of
the
doctor's
treatment,
rather
than
for
the
kind
of
use
that
was
being
made
here
and,
of
course,
the
catch-all
would
have
made
this
evidence
admissible
regardless
of
these
other
considerations,
but
as
i
say,
what
the
court
chose
was
the
narrowest
ground
of
decision.
now--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
may
be
some
ambiguity
in
the
grammar,
although
i
think
your
point
is
one
that
is
very
well
taken.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
first
one
that
you
said,
that
ordinarily
if
you
wanted
the
word
recent
to
carry
over,
you
would
have
a
comma
before
the
second
in
the
series,
and
then
to
be
clear
you
probably
would
have...
it
would
say,
recent
fabrication,
comma,
improper
influence
or
improper
motive,
add
the
word
improper
again.
that
would
make
it
clear
that
the
recent
carried
over.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
natural
reading
of
the
grammar
as
it's
written
here
is
that
recent
modifies
fabrication,
and
then
improper
influence
or
motive
can
both
be
improper,
because
you
no
longer
would
have
another
way
of
indicating
that
the
improper
carried
over
unless
you
repeated
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
would
think
not.
for
one
thing,
in
wigmore
and
other
common
law
sources,
recent
fabrication
is
discussed
separately
from
improper
influence
or
motive,
which
is
not
modified
in
the
discussion
by
the
word
recent.
the...
and
wigmore
explains,
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief,
that
narrowly
construed
recent
fabrication
arises,
the
charge
of
recent
fabrication
arises
when
the
point
is
made
that
he
had
an
earlier
opportunity
to
explain
it
this
way
and
did
not.
it
was
a
charge
of
a
lack
of
stating
this
explanation
sooner
than
the
exigencies
of
the
trial,
where
improper
influence
or
motive
was
not
so
temporally
directed.
the
two...
the
distinction
became
somewhat
blurred
in
practice,
but
it's
often
difficult
to
pinpoint
when
a
motive
would
have
first
occurred.
in
a
case
of
the
kind
that
we're
dealing
with,
there
could
be
very
much
of
a
catch-22
situation
under
this
reading.
if
the
alleged
sexual
abuse
never
started
before
the
parents
were
separated,
there
could
never
be
a
time
prior
to
when
you
could
say
that
the
child
would
have
had
the
preference
for
custody
with
the
nonabusing
parent
in
mind
in
making
the
charge,
and
the
child,
if
being
abused
by
one
parent,
would
tend
to
prefer
custody
in
the
other
parent
on
that
ground
alone,
so--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
way
of
looking
at
it
would
have
much
greater
force
under
the
old
common
law
practice
where
the
statement
was
not
itself
admissible
but
could
be
used
only
to
rehabilitate
the
testimony
on
the
stand.
the
first
thing
to
be
noticed
about
this
rule
is
the
very
beginning
of
it,
before
you
get
to
the
number
1.
it
says,
a
statement
is
not
hearsay
if,
and
that
was
a
deliberate
and
fundamental
departure
from
the
common
law
practice,
and
this
was
not
a
hidden
agenda.
this
is,
what,
the
only
paragraph
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
set
forth
on
page
21
of
the
blue
brief,
just
below
the
middle
of
the
page,
explicitly
explains
at
common
law
they
were
available
only
to
rehabilitate
whatever
was
said
on
the
stand.
but
the
advisory
committee
to
this
extent
was
adopting
the
more
modern
view
of
scholars
who
had
criticized
the
common
law
as
too
restrictive
of
hearsay.
when
both
the
witness
to
whom
the
statement
was
made
and
the
declarant
were
present
in
the
courtroom
for
cross-examination,
there
had
been
views
expressed
that
all
statements
previously
made
should
always
be
admissible
under
that
view,
but
to
this
extent--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
view
was
being
adopted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
statement,
the
prior
statement
is
being
allowed
into
evidence
as
it
bears
on
the
issue
in
the
case.
here
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence,
the
issue
of
whether
the
conduct
in
these
very
serious
charges
did
or
did
not
occur.
it
is
not...
once
you're
introducing
it
as
evidence,
it's
not
evidence
about
whether
the
child
had
a
motive,
it's
evidence
for
the
jury
to
consider
on
the
issue
before...
of
the
issue
of
guilt.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
once
it
comes
in.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it's
rather
hard
to
make
a
credible
charge
that
a
witness
is
lying
if
you
don't
give
some
reason
why
you
think
the
witness
is
lying.
you
can
argue
that
the
witness
should
not
be
believed,
that
the
witness
is
mistaken,
misperceived
something.
that's
not
a
charge
of
fabrication,
but
it's
rather
difficult.
most
cases
in
which
a
witness
is
charged
with
fabrication,
we
believe
will
fall
within
this
rule.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but...
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
and
is...
it
lends...
well,
i
think
that
that
is
an
alternative
way
of
expressing
what
the
rule
says,
consistent
with
that
testimony,
and
is
offered
to
rebut
a
charge
that
the
testimony
is
the
product
of
an
improper
motive.
if
it
adds
credibility,
if
it
lends
further
credibility
to
that
testimony,
that
is
a
way
of
rebutting
the
charge
that
the
testimony
is
the
product
of
an
improper
motive
rather
than
the
truth.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
perhaps
one
could
say
that.
we
think
the
proper
approach
to
this
is
a
nuanced
approach.
does
the
prior
statement
add
anything
of
probative
value
to
what
you
have
on
the
stand?
was
it
made
under
circumstances
that
give
it
further
credibility?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
yes,
there
are
a
number
of
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rules,
but
there
is
also
this
rule,
which
allows
such
statements
in
to
add
further
credibility
to
the
testimony
on
the
stand
by
explaining
what
was
said
in
other
contexts
and
in
other
circumstances
by
the
same
witness,
and
i
do
want
to
remind
the
court
that
the
rules
themselves
contain
a
guide
to
their
interpretation,
and
that
is
in
rule
102,
which
was
not
cited
in
the
briefs
but
should
not
be
lost
sight
of.
it
explicitly
says,
"these
rules
shall
be
construed
to
secure
fairness
in
administration,
elimination
of
unjustifiable
expense
and
delay,
and
promotion
of
growth
and
development
of
the
law
of
evidence
to
the
end
that
the
truth
may
be
ascertained
and
proceedings
justly
determined.
"
and
then
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
would
argue
that
that
would
have
been
a
permissible
ground
for
letting
it
in,
but
that
does
not
diminish
the
justification
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
here,
and
also
by
the
trial
judge,
of
trying
to
show
that
the
testimony
that
the
child
gave
on
the
stand
was
not
the
product
of
an
improper
motive
by
showing
that
she
gave
very
consistent
testimony,
and
detailed
testimony,
in
circumstances
where,
while
that
motive
may
have
still
been
in
existence,
the
circumstances
would
have
made
that
motive
less
pronounced
than
other
motives
in
talking
to
people
that
she
explained
on
the
stand
whose
job
it
was
to
help
kids.
this
is
in
talking
to
the
social
case
worker,
in
talking
to
three
pediatricians
about
what
happened
to
her,
in
spontaneously
telling
her
babysitter
what
happened
in
a
context
where
it
really
is
doubtful
whether
she
would
have
understood
that
any
effect
on
custody
really
could
emanate
from
what
she
was
saying,
and
yet
she
was
making
these
statements
in
circumstances
where
the
custody
issue
was
not
being
adjudicated
in
a
court
proceeding,
as
she
might
have
perceived
what
was
going
on
in
the
trial.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
do
think
that
if
the
veracity
is
challenged
without
any
mention
of
what
possibly
could
have
been
an
improper
influence
or
motive,
there
would
be
no
basis
under
this
rule--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
could
be...
the
circumstances
may
make
it
an
implied
charge.
if
there's
no
reason
given
to
the
jury
even
by
implication
of
why
the
witness
might
be
lying--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it's
not
going
to
be
much
of
a
charge.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
one
could
say
that,
although
if
no
implication
of
a
reason
arises,
even
from
the
circumstances,
it's
rather
hard
to
see
what
it
is
that
one
is
supposed
to
rebut
in
those
circumstances,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
those
are
not
really
lies,
and
i
don't
think
the
rule
applies
to
charges
of
misperception,
that
yes,
the
witness
may
be
telling
the
truth
as
best
he
conceives
it
but
he's
mistaken
for
various
reasons,
whether
or
not
he
thinks
he's
telling
the
truth,
which
wouldn't
raise
any
issue
under
this
rule,
so
it
isn't
that
every
witness--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--so
it
isn't
that
every
witness
is
always
accused
of
lying.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
may--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
can
be
a
situation
of
that
kind,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
quite,
quite
so,
your
honor,
but
we're
getting
afield
from
what
happened
in
this
case,
and
what
this
case
was
about,
which
is
whether
what
we
would
call
a
more
nuanced
approach
in
accordance
with
some
of
the
modern--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
in
many
ways
this
case
is
reminiscent
of
the
problem
that
the
court
had
before
it
in
the
daubert
case,
in
which
a
contention
was
being
made
that
the
old
rule
of
the
frye
case
should
be
preserved
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
which
would
allow
scientific
evidence
in
only
when
it's
generally
accepted.
and
in
the
portion
of
daubert
that
was
unanimous,
the
court
rejected
that
as
inconsistent
with
the
more
liberal
thrust
of
the
rules
and
their
very
generous
definition
of
relevant
evidence
that
a
more
multifaceted
nuanced
approach
rather
than
what
the
court
called
the
austere
standard,
a
per
se
rule
for
all
cases,
should
be
adopted.
it's
very
comparable,
it
seems
to
us,
to
the
premotive
rule.
if
one
contrasts
it
with
the
formulation
in
one
of,
i
think,
the
more
thoughtful
recent
cases,
a
sixth
circuit
case
called
united
states
v.
lawson,
which
is
cited
in
respondent's
brief,
and
appropriately
enough
was
written
by
a
district
judge
sitting
by
designation...
if
i
can
just
read
a
little
excerpt
to
the
court
from
that
opinion,
written
by
now-court-of-appeals
judge
sir
heinrich
for
the
sixth
circuit
in
1989,
when
he
was
a
district
judge,
the
approach
that
the
court
took
there
was
that
the
trial
judge
must
examine
the
circumstances
under
which
the
statement
was
made
and
make
a
determination
of
the
statement's...
this
is
the
prior
statement's...
relevancy
and
probity.
while
these
factors
are
more
likely
to
be
found
where
the
statement
was
made
prior
to
the
alleged
discrediting
influence,
temporal
probity
should
not
be
a
condition
precedent
to
admissibility.
where
there
are
other
indicia
of
reliability
surrounding
a
prior
consistent
statement
that
make
it
relevant
to
rebut
a
charge
of
recent
fabrication
or
improper
motive,
then
the
fact
that
the
statement
was
made
after
the
alleged
motive
to
falsify
should
not
preclude
its
admissibility.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
justice
breyer,
with
all
respect,
the
child
answered
most
questions,
and
the
effectiveness
of
the
cross-examination
was
explicitly
excluded
by
this
court
from
the
grant
of
certiorari.
the
spontaneous
statement,
when
one
reads
this
transcript,
the
first
statement
made
was
a
spontaneous
statement
made
to
the
babysitter
which
the
child
was
reluctant
to
explain
and
refused
to
state
to
the
child's
mother,
and
at
one
point
in
the
testimony
the
child
stated
that
she
was
afraid
she
would...
that
her
mother
would
not
love
her
any
more
if
her
mother
found
out
what
happened.
there
was
much
in
this
testimony
that
added
credibility,
and
tended
to
suggest
that
there
was
not
coaching.
it
is...
we
are
dealing
here
with
whether
highly
probative
evidence
that
the
jury--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
was,
because
it
was
made
in
various
ways
to
various
case
workers
to
whom
she
was
talking
to
try
to
get
some
help
with
her
problems,
rather
than
with
any
connection
with
an
idea
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--a
custody
determination--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--none
of
this...
none
of
this
was
about
any
conduct
other
than
the
very
conduct
that
was
charged.
it
shed
additional
light
to
the...
for
the
jury
in
deciding
whether
to
believe
one
of
the
only
two
eye
witnesses
to
this
conduct,
who
was
a
4-year-old
child,
the
other
one
being
the
alleged
perpetrator,
and
to
see
the
pattern
of
these
statements
that
the
child
made
in
describing
what
occurred
over
a
course
of
a
year-and-a-half
in
various
circumstances
shed
light
rather
than
prejudice
on
the
issue
that
was
before
the
jury.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
on
the
stand
it
was
an
intimidating
situation
for
her.
the
accused
was
there,
she
had
the
misconception
that
part
of
the
question
might
be
that
her
mother
might
have
to
go
to
jail,
she...
part
of
what
adds
credibility
to
her
story
is
the
difficulty
she
found
in
expressing
it
in
words
the
way
she
would
depict
it
with
the
dolls,
and
the
frustration
she
felt
in
trying
to
show
exactly
the
way
the
dolls
should
be
configured--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
think
from
the
circumstances.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
and
that...
this
is
not
prejudicial
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
not
always,
but
the
circumstances
amply
support
it
here.
we're
not
talking
about
something
that
it
is
a
distraction
about
some
other
conduct
of
the
accused.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
the
conduct
at
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
motive--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
isn't
what
the
jury
is
to
determine,
and
this
is
being
admitted
not
to
rehabilitate
testimony,
but
as
evidence,
and
as
evidence
that
goes
to
what
the
jury
is
supposed
to
decide,
which
is
whether
the
charged
criminal
conduct
occurred.
