mr.
gandert,
why
don't
you
go
back
to
your
first
point
and
emphasize
the
word
rebut,
and
would
your
argument
not
be
that
a
prior
consistent
statement
does
not
rebut
an
improper
motive
or
influence
unless
it
occurred
before
that
arose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
word
rebut
is
the
key
to
your
case,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
it's
made
after
the
motive
or
the
improper
influence
occurred,
it
doesn't
have
any
probative
force
as
rebuttal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
on
that
basis,
mr.
wallace,
that
even
if
it
were
not
admissible
under
801(d)(1)(b)(3),
it
might
nevertheless
be
admissible
on
the
ground
the
district
court
relied
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
prior
consistent
statement
would
help
a
witness
who's
not
very
articulate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
can
have
a
faulty
memory
without
any
improper
motive.
just,
you
didn't
see
the
perpetrator
as
well
as
you
thought
you
did.
the
room
was
dark,
or
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--police
showing
an
alleged
criminal
with
photo...
or,
a
witness,
rather,
pictures
of
a
suspect
in
a
case,
and
that
can
influence
the
person
in
an
improper
way
without
any
particular
motive
to
lie.
i'm
not
sure
that
you
have
to
have
a,
the
evil
intent
that
you
describe
in
order
to
be
an
untruthful
witness,
and
it
can
still
be
an
improper
influence
even
though
no
evil
motive
is
associated
with
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there,
if
you
said,
well,
i
identified
this
person
before
i
saw
the
picture,
that
would
clearly
rebut
the
charge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
wallace,
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
this
case.
the
evidence
may
well
have
been
admissible
under
the
catch-all,
and
unfortunately
a
case
in
which
evidence
that
really
has
probative
force
is
being
used
to
test
the
scope
of
this
rule,
which
normally
would
apply
in
quite
different
cases.
that's
one
of
the
problems
the
case
presents,
i
think,
because
these
are
very
appealing
facts
that
they
provide
to
you.
