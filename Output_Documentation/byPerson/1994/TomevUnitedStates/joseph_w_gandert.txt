mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
charged
motive
to
fabricate
may
be
rebutted
under
federal
rule
of
evidence
801(d)(1)(b)
by
seven
out-of-court
statements
made
after
declarant
had
that
same
motive
to
fabricate.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
hold,
as
did
the
common
law,
that
a
prior
consistent
statement
rebuts
a
charged
improper
motive
only
if
that
motive
did
not
exist
at
the
time
the
statement
was
made.
the
criminal
charges
in
this
case
arose
out
of
a
bitter
child
custody
dispute
between
the
petitioner,
matthew
tome,
and
his
ex-wife.
the
dispute
involved
their
small
daughter,
who
is
referred
to
in
the
briefs
by
the
initials
a.t.--
the
first
time
the
child
mentioned
any
abuse
was
14
months
after
it
was
alleged
to
have
taken
place,
and
it
was
coincidentally
on
the
same
date
a
child
custody
hearing
was
supposed
to
have
taken
place.
six
different
witnesses
were
allowed
by
the
court
to
tell
what
a.t.
had
told
them.
their
statements
expanded
considerably
on
the
very
weak
testimony
at
trial
of
a.t.
all
of
these
statements
were
admitted
as
substantive
evidence.
as
the
trial
judge
ruled
in
his
order
releasing
mr.
tome
pending
a
decision
of
this
court,
the
testimony
of
the
six
witnesses
about
statements
made
by
the
child
substantially
caused
the
defendant's
conviction.
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
admission
of
the
statements,
all
of
the
statements
under
801(d)(1)(b),
and
set
forth
a
balancing
test
under
federal
rules
of
evidence
402
and
403
to
determine
whether
the
statements
had
probative
value
apart
from
mere
repetition.
they
took
into
consideration
three
factors:
1)
the
strength
of
the
motive;
2)
the
circumstances
in
which
the
statement
was
made,
and
3)
the
declarant's
demonstrated
propensity
to
lie.
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
consider
that
the
child
had
the
same
motive
at
the
time
she
made
her
statements
as
at
the
time
of
trial.
that
balancing
test,
which
was
imposed
by
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
is
inconsistent
both
with
the
plain
language
of
the
rule
and
the
common
law
history
behind
801(d)(1)(b).
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
we're
indicating
that
the
statement
was
offered,
but
whether
it
was
offered
for
rebuttal,
we
have
some
question
in
regard
to
that.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
the
question
is
that
in
terms
of
rebuttal
it
did
not
meet
the
premotive
standard,
and
it's
implicit
and
inherent
in
the
rule
that
any
statement
which
is
made
to
rebut
occurs
prior
to
the
motive
to
fabricate.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
our
contention,
your
honor,
is
that
by
offered,
that
means
that
the
court
has
to
make
a
decision
that
if
the
statement,
if
it
is
allowed
in
and
accepted,
that
a
jury
would
find
that
a
statement
actually
rebuts.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
the
court
has
to
make
an
initial
determination
similar
to
the
determinations
made
in
other
evidentiary
questions
as
to
preliminarily
whether
the
statement
does
in
fact
rebut,
because
if
the
court...
if
a
party
is
allowed
to
present
a
statement
which
does
not
in
fact
rebut,
even
though
they're
offering
it,
it's
a
misrepresentation
upon
the
court.
under--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--because
this
is
a
rule
with
a
particularly
narrow
purpose.
the
only
purpose
of
this
rule
is
for
rebuttal.
it's
not
a
relevancy
rule
such
as
401,
402,
and
403.
at
common
law,
this
kind
of
evidence
was
received
very
cautiously
under
narrow
circumstances
and
did
not
occur
very
often.
it
was
not
to
be
used
all
the
time,
such
as
a
relevancy
law.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
that's
not
our
contention.
our
contention
is
that
the
federal
rules,
that
rule
801(d)(1)(b)
was
embodied
with
the
background,
against
the
background
of
the
common
law,
and
the
rule
must
be
read
in
that
context.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
hearsay
rules
in
particular
are
rules
of
exclusion,
and
most
of
them
are
derived
from
the
common
law,
and
this
rule
must
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
common
law.
the
advisory
committee,
when
they
adopted
this
rule,
indicated
that
the
purpose
of
this
rule
was
to
change
the
admissibility
of
evidence
which
was
formerly
admissible
as...
for
rehabilitation
would
now
be
admissible
for
substantive
evidence,
and
so
that
was
the
only
change
they
indicated
in
the
rule
as
it
had
been
at
common
law.
they
indicated
that
traditionally...
prior
consistent
statements
traditionally
have
been
admissible
to
rebut
charges
of
recent
fabrication
or
improper
influence
or
motive,
but
not
as
substantive
evidence.
under
the
rule,
they
are
substantive
evidence.
that
was
the
only
change
that
the
advisory
committee
made.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
that's
correct,
your
honor.
our
reading
of
the
rule
is
that
recent
means
more
recent
than
the
prior
consistent
statement.
recent
has
a
temporal
meaning,
and
it
has
to
have...
there
has
to
be
some
reason
it
was
put
into
the
rule.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
we
would
also
agree
with
what
his
honor
has
indicated
regarding,
there
was
a
rejection
of
the
weinstein
view
by
the
committee
which
adopted
the
federal
rules,
and
they
did
indicate
that
they
did
not
want
there
to
be
widespread
use
of
hearsay
only
upon
the
declarant
being
available
for
cross-examination,
and
there
was
a
rejection
of
the
weinstein
view,
there
was
a
rejection
of
the
model
codes
of
evidence
which
were
adopted
in
adopting
this
rule.
this
rule,
there
was
no
argument
regarding
this
rule
as
opposed
to
801(d)(1)(a)
and
801(d)(1)(c).
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
no.
that's
just
one
particular
aspect
of
the
rule,
and
we...
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
the
child--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--it's
improper
motive
or
influence.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
yes,
as
well,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
the
way
most
commentators
in
most
cases
have
read
it,
that
it's
improper
motive
or
improper
influence.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
the
charged
improper
motive
was
actually
that
she
wanted
to
be
with
her
mother
rather
than
her
father.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
that's
the
charge
that
the
government
made
that
the
defense
counsel
was
asserting,
and
they...
it's
only
upon
a
charge
of
an
improper
motive
that
all
these
statements
were
allowed
in.
if
there
was
no
charge
of
an
improper
motive,
all
these
statements
would
have
been
hearsay
and
would
have
been
kept
out.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
it's
improper
in
the
sense
that
that's
the
way
the
rule
makes
out
the
motive,
and
the
government
claimed
that
defense
counsel
had
charged
that
the
improper
motive
was
that
the
child
wanted
to
live
with
her
mother
rather
than
her
father,
and
that
that
child
had
the
same
identical
motive
at
the
time
she
first
made
her
first
accusation
as
of
the
time
of
trial,
therefore
the
statements
did
not
rebut.
they
were
basically
used
for
bolstering
purposes.
they
were
not
used
to
actually
rebut
the
charge
of
recent
fabrication
or
improper
motive.
the
child
had
the
identical
motive
that
she
wanted
to
live
with
her
mother
rather
than
her
father
when
she
made
the
initial
accusation.
the
charged
improper
motive
at
trial
by
the
prosecutor
was
that
defense
counsel
had
indicated
during
cross-examination
of
the
child
that
she
preferred
to
live
with
her
mother
rather
than
her
father
because
she
had
more
friends,
more
toys,
and--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--your
honor,
we
would
contend
that
this
case
concerns
a
recent
fabrication,
and
what
happened
here
is
there
was
a
14-month
delay
before
the
child
made
her
first
accusation.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
it
doesn't
tend
to
disprove
it,
because--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--that...
in
this
case,
the
problem
is
that
the
child
had
the
same
motive,
so
no
motive
was
disproved.
if
the
child
had
the
same
motive
at
the
beginning
of
the
case,
or
when
she
made
her
initial
accusation,
as
later
on,
there's
no
motive
to
actually
be
disproved.
therefore,
all
of
her
testimony
is
mere
repetition.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
that's
exactly
what
you
have...
what
his
honor
indicated
that
you
have
to
do.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
it's
not
probative
because
it
doesn't
meet
the
strict
requirements
of
the
rule.
perhaps
it's
relevant,
perhaps
it's
reliable
under,
perhaps,
803(24),
but
the
purpose
of
this
rule
was
a
narrow
one
of
rebutting
that
charge.
the
charge...
when
the
child
has
the
same
motive
before
as
at
the
time
of
trial,
it
doesn't
rebut
the
charge.
now--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--it
possibly--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--it's
80--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--we
contend
that
it
would
not,
but
the
tenth
circuit
failed
to
go
into
that
thorny
issue
and
decide
whether
or
not
the
statements
were
admissible
under
other
rules.
we
objected
before
the
tenth
circuit
that
they
were
not
admissible
under
803(4),
and
i
can
give
the
rationale
why
we
indicated
that,
but
the
statements,
the
pediatricians,
they
might
have
come
in,
they
might
not
have.
we
contend
they
would
not
have.
it's
clear
that
the
babysitter's
second
statement,
which
was
very
elaborate,
highly
prejudicial,
highly
descriptive,
the
judge
rejected
the
government's
attempt
to
allow
that
statement
in
under
803(24),
and
instead
indicated
it
was
solely
admitted
under
801(d)(1)(b).
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
i
believe
what
your
honor
said
is
correct.
i
think
that
at
the
trial
level
all
of
the
parties
were
fairly
confused
regarding
the
admissibility
of
this
type
of
evidence,
especially
since
as
witness
after
witness
came
in,
all
of
their
testimony
was
being
allowed
in
apparently
under
801(d)(1)(b),
and
then
sometimes
the
judge
would
indicate
that
the
evidence
was
also
being
allowed
in
under
another
rule
as
well,
sometimes
he
was
not
explicit.
there's
a
lot
of
problems
involved
in
the
record
indicating
upon
what
reason
the
judge
was
admitting
some
of
the
statements.
he
did
not
make
it
all
explicit.
the
tenth
circuit
indicated
that
it
was
their
understanding
that
everything
was
being
admitted
under...
or
at
least,
they
went
along
with
that
everything
was
being
admitted
under
801(d)(1)(b)
rather
than
reaching
those
other
issues,
which
they
could
have
gone
into
as
alternative
reasons
for
their
decision,
but
they
did
not.
another
problem
involved
in
this
case
is
that
what
this
case
is
doing
is
rejecting
the
common
law.
this
case
has
to
be
read
in
context
with
the
common
law,
and
in
context
with
the
common
law,
it
indicates
that
a
premotive
statement,
only
statements
which
were
made
prior
to
the
motive
were
admissible
at
common
law.
we
believe
that
the
court
adopted...
the
court,
congress
and
the
advisory
committee
adopted
the
common
law
view
of
801(d)(1)(b).
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
i
think
that
what
occurred
when
this
rule
was
written
is
that
the
drafters
were
not
being
precise.
they
just
indicated...
they
used
words
of
art
that
had
been
used
in
the
common
law,
but
they
were
not--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--they
did
not
see
the
problems
involved
with
not
defining
the
terms
exactly.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
that...
it's
not
necessary
to
reach...
to
find
that
to
rule
in
our
favor,
and
what
we
indicate
is
that
this
common
law
rule
is
a
bright
line
rule
which
is
easy
to
apply.
what
can
happen
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
is
merely
upon
a
suggestion
that
somebody
is
lying,
or
has
fabricated
something,
or
has
an
improper
motive,
then
a
party
can
then
bring
in
10
different
hearsay
witnesses
to
say--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--i
think
that
the
language--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--no,
we
don't
ignore
the
language
of
the
rule,
but
we
have
to
read
it
in
context,
most
in
accord
with
the
context
and
ordinary
usage.
we
have
to
read
it
in
the
way
it's
most
compatible
with
the
surrounding
body
of
law.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
that's
correct,
and
our
contention
is
that
rebut
means
disprove
by
means
of
a
premotive
consistent
statement,
and
that--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
some
commentators
have
indicated
that
recent
is
superfluous,
but
recent
is
a
temporal
term
which
means
something.
we
suggest
that
it
means
recent
fabrication,
recent
motive,
recent
improper
influence,
but--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--because
rebut
has
to
be
read
in
the
common
law
way,
with
the
common
law
history
in
mind,
and
with
the
pre-1975
cases
in
mind,
and
rebut,
when
the
federal
rules
adopted
that
rule,
adopted
the
traditional
way
of
looking
at
that
rule.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
in
that
context,
but
in
the
context
of
the
common
law,
it
has
to
be
a
premotive
statement,
a
statement
which
occurs
prior
to
the
motive
to
fabricate.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
oh,
i
think
rebut
has
to
be
read
in
terms
of
its
common
law
history
and
the
way
it
was
considered
at
common
law,
and
at
common
law,
as
justice
stevens
indicated,
only
statements
made
prior
to
motive
to
fabricate
actually
had
rebuttal
value,
and
actually
did,
in
fact,
rebut.
statements
made
after
that,
perhaps
probative,
perhaps
relevant,
didn't
meet
the
narrow
test
of
the
rule,
and
this
rule
has
only
one
rationale,
and
that
is,
it's
designed
for
rebuttal.
now,
the
government's
position
in
this
case
converts
it
into
a
relevancy
rule,
makes
it
into
a
rule
similar
to
401,
402,
and
403,
its
consideration
makes
801(d)(1)(b)
merely
upon
a
suggestion
of
recent
fabrication,
improper
motive,
or
improper
influence,
then
you
look
at
relevancy,
and
what
the--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--because
this
rule
was
adopted
under
article
viii,
and--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--the
problem
with
looking
at
it
from
the
government's
position
is
that
it
makes
meaningless
the
rebuttal
requirement,
and
what
happens
then,
it
opens
the
floodgates
toward
manufactured
evidence.
for
example,
witnesses
with
poor
credibility,
or
inarticulate,
so
to
speak,
they
only
have
to
repeat
their
stories
to
more
credible
and
more
sophisticated
individuals
who
could
persuasively
then
retell
the
story
at
the
time
of
trial,
and
this
is
what
could
happen
if
the
court
allows
the
interpretation
of
801(d)(1)(b)
as
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
government.
it
makes
meaningless--
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
your
honor,
i'd
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
w.
gandert
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
what
i'd
like
to
do
is
add
to
my
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
word
recent
modifying
fabrication.
the
reason
i
stated
earlier
that
this
court
need
not
decide
that
question
is
because
a
charge
of
improper
motive
is
necessarily
also
a
charge
of
recent
fabrication.
a
motive
is
only
improper
if
it
causes
a
witness
to
fabricate
her
story,
and
we
quote
professor
graham
to
this

of
our
reply
brief,
and
i
think
the
problem
that
occurs
in
this
case
is
the
parade
of
witnesses
used
ostensibly
to
rebut
which
are
really
used
to
bolster
the
declarant's
testimony.
they
were
used
for
a
reason
that
they
shouldn't
have
been
used.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
adopt
a
bright
line
common
law
approach
which
is
easy
to
utilize
for
litigants,
parties,
and
judges.
thank
you,
your
honor.
