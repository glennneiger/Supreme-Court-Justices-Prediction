well,
improper
in
your
view,
then,
does
modify
motive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
an
improper
motive
to
want
to
be
with
your
maternal
parent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
improper?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
it
would
be
improper
in
the
context
that
it's
improper
to
allow
you,
to
allow
the
witness
to
change
their
testimony.
it's
improper
only
in
that
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
your
point.
then
what
purpose
does
the
term
recent
serve,
then?
under
that
view,
recent
is
superfluous.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
what
you're
saying
is
that
you
can
infer
from
the
record
that
the
judge
made
the
balancing
test
that
justice
breyer
asked
you
whether
or
not
it
was
made
on
the
record?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say,
just
infer
it
from
the
fact
that
he
let
it
in?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
we
always
infer
that
the
rule
that
judge
breyer
refers
to
has
been
adverted
to
and
used?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
second
case
i
have
for
the
court
is
tome
versus
united
states
number
93-6892.
this
case
requires
us
to
resolve
an
issue
of
evidence
law
arising
under
the
federal
rules
of
the
evidence.
the
ruling
question
is
the
sub
part
of
rule
801
understanding
that
part
of
evidence
rules
that
relate
to
the
hearsay
doctrine
and
the
question
is
whether
the
testimony
of
the
principal
witness
can
be
bolstered
by
calling
other
witnesses
who
then
testify
that
the
principal
witnesses
made
consistent
out
of
court
statements
at
various
times.
this
was
a
felony
child
abuse
case,
it
was
prosecuted
in
the
united
states
district
court
because
the
alleged
crime
occurred
on
an
indian
reservation.
the
child
was
only
six
and
one
half
years
old
when
the
trial
took
place.
when
the
defense
questioned
her
about
the
allegations
of
abuse,
she
was
reluctant
to
answer
and
for
some
other
question
she
hesitated
for
some
40
to
55
seconds
before
answering
and
the
trial
judge
said
we
have
a
very
difficult
situation
here.
after
the
child
testified
the
government
produced
six
witnesses
who
testified
about
the
child
statements
to
them
and
these
statements
were
consistent
with
the
prosecution
theory
of
the
case
and
with
the
child?s
testimony,
and
those
statements
of
course
implicated
the
defendant.
rule
801
provides
that
the
consistent
statement
or
admissible
when
they
are
introduced
to
rebut
a
charge,
but
the
principal
witness?s
testimony
was
a
recent
fabrication
or
the
product
of
an
improper
influence
or
motive
and
the
general
rule
of
common
law
was
that
the
prior
consistent
statement
had
no
relevance
to
rebut
those
charges
unless
the
prior
consistent
statement
was
made
before
the
fabrication
was
contrived
or
before
the
bias
of
influence
arose.
we
hold
that
the
federal
rules
of
the
evidence
incorporate
that
same
limitation
and
that
it
was
error
to
admit
the
child?s
consistent
statements
made
after
the
alleged
influence
and
motive.
the
alleged
influence
and
motive
in
the
case
was
that
the
child
did
not
want
to
return
to
the
custody
of
her
father
who
had
been
charged
with
the
child
abuse
and
the
allegation
was
she
concocted
the
story.
since
the
statements
and
questions
were
made
after
that
motive
to
fabricate
arose,
they
are
inadmissible
under
the
rule.
we
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
which
would
have
held
admissibility
of
the
statement.
the
case
before
us
illustrates
some
of
the
important
reasons
for
our
interpretation
especially
in
criminal
cases.
there
is
a
danger
that
the
whole
emphasis
of
trial
can
shift
to
out
of
court
statements
not
to
the
in
court
ones,
here
with
a
rather
weak
charge
of
fabrication
the
government
was
permitted
to
present
a
parade
of
sympathetic
and
credible
witnesses,
who
did
no
more
then
recount
the
complaint
witnesses
out
of
court
statements.
courts
must
be
sensitive
to
the
difficulties
attended
upon
the
prosecution
of
alleged
child
abusers.
we
cannot
alter
evidentiary
rules
for
the
particular
classes
of
cases,
we
intimate
no
view,
however
concerning
the
admissibility
of
any
of
the
out
of
court
statements
and
questions
under
other
sections
of
the
evidence
court.
these
matters
are
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
in
the
first
instance.
judgment
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
scalia
joins
all
but
part
ii-b
of
the
opinion
for
the
court
and
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
o?connor
and
justice
thomas
joins.
