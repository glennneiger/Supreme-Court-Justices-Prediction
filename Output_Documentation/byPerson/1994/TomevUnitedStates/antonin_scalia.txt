justice

mr.
gandert,
here's
the
problem
that
you
confront
if
you
sever
the
recent,
the
word
recent
from
the
latter
part,
namely
from
improper
influence
or
motive.
as
long
as
recent
is
attached
to
the
words,
you
can
make
the
argument
that
the
purpose
of
the
rebuttal
has
to
be
a
temporal
purpose.
you
can
show
that
no,
this
is
not
recent.
you
must
be
showing
no,
this
is
not
recent,
i
had
the
same
story
before.
but
once
you
take
away
the
word
recent,
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
to
rebut
improper
influence
or
motive.
for
example,
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
it
tends
to
disprove
the
improper
motive
if
you
can
show
that
i
had
this
story
way
back
at
the
beginning
before
my
mother
had
a
chance
to
plant
this
story
in
my
mind,
whereas
if
it
just
came
out
at
trial,
it
would
be
much
more
likely
that
it
was
the
result
of
coaching.
that
argument
is
available
unless
the
word
recent
applies
to
improper
motive.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
what
it
concerns,
i'm
talking
about
your
reading
of
the
text.
why
does
it
not
tend
to
disprove
an
improper
motive,
namely
the
improper
motive
of
wanting
to
live
with
my
mother
instead
of
my
father?
why
doesn't
it
tend
to
disprove
that,
if
you
say,
i
had
this
story
a
long
time
ago?
the
more
recent
it
is,
the
more
likely
it
is
i
was
calculating
how
i
could
get
to
live
with
my
mother.
it
tends
to
disprove
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
it
may
not
tend
to
disprove
a
recent
improper
motive
if
you
can
show
that,
well,
that
statement
was
not
before
the
motive
arose
anyway,
but
it
would
tend
to
disprove
the
existence
of
any
improper
motive
whether
recent
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
disprove
the
motive
to
rebut
a
charge
of
recent
or
improper...
oh,
i
see,
you
think
you
must
have
to
eliminate
the
existence
of
the
motive.
i
thought
all
you
have
to
eliminate
to
rebut
is
the
fact
that
the
motive
was
the
reason
for
your
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
stand
by
my
view
that
it
certainly
tends
to
disprove
that
in
this
case,
if
you
can
show,
this
is
not
something
that
i've
been
pumped
up
for
at
trial,
that
my
mother
put
in
my
ear
in
order
to
get
me
to
go
back
to
live
with
her,
as
i
want
to
do,
but
rather,
i
said
this
way
back,
long
before
it's
at
all
likely
that
anybody
put
the
notion
in
my
head.
why
isn't
that
probative?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
rule
would
presumably
have
read
that
prior
consistent
statements
by
witnesses
may
be
admitted
if
relevant,
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
i
am
impressed
by
the
fact
that
this
rule
does
not
say
you
can
admit
it
in
order
to
rebut
the
charge
that
the
witness
is
lying.
a
witness
can
be
lying
for
a
lot
of
reasons.
it's
only
recent
fabrication
or
improper
influence
or
motive.
now,
the
mere
fact
that
the
person
was...
you
know,
gave
the
same
story
earlier,
i
guess
you
could
say
indirectly
refutes
the
fact
of
an
improper
motive,
but
very
indirectly.
all
it
really
proves
is
that
the
person
is
telling
the
truth
now,
but
that's
not
what
the
rule
wants
you
to
get
at.
it
wants
you
to
get
at
rebutting
the
motive,
and
the
only
way
you
directly
rebut
the
motive,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
show
that
the
statement
was
made
before
the
motive
even
ever
arose.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
agree
with
that,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
used
for
a
broader
purpose,
but
the
test
for
its
admissibility
is
still
the
narrow,
old
test,
and
that
test
is
not
to
show
that
the
witness
is
telling
the
truth,
and
it's
very
peculiar
that
it's
put
that
way.
it's
not
admitted
to...
you
know,
if
the
witness'
testimony
is
contradicted
or
sought
to
be
impeached.
it
doesn't
speak
that
broadly,
only
particular
kinds
of
charges,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
those
charges
are
only
directly...
directly
rebutted
by
the
fact
that
the
prior
statement
was
made
before,
before
that
motive
could
have
existed.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
it
comes
in,
that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
come
in
unless
it
is
going
to
the
motive,
and
if...
this
rule
would
not
even
have
any
application
if
the
defendant
just
came
in
and
tried
to
show
that
this
child
witness
was
lying,
and
said
nothing
about
why
she
was
lying,
just,
she
was
lying.
you
could
not
get
it
in
under
this
rule,
simply
say,
well,
she's
been
telling
the
same
story
all
along.
no,
no,
i
haven't
impugned
her
motive.
it's
only
by
impugning
the
motive
the...
now,
that
makes
me
think
that
the
evidence
must
go
directly
to
the
motive--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it
only
goes
directly
to
the
motive
as
opposed
to
going
to
whether
she's
telling
the
truth
more
generally,
which
is
not
the
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
for
fabrication
your
opponent
can
rely
upon
the
word
recent.
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
is
there
any
difference
between
the
interpretation
that
you
are
urging
upon
us
and
a
rule
which
simply
reads
that
prior
consistent
statements
may
be
introduced
when
the
veracity
of
the
witness'
statements
on
the
stand
is
challenged,
as
a
practical
matter?
can
you
conceive
of
any,
many,
if
any
situations
in
which
this
rule
would
apply,
the
rule
i
expressed
would
apply
where
this
one
wouldn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
implied
or
expressed,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
is
impliedly
or
expressly...
how
does
the
rule
read?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
isn't
every
charge--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that.
what
the
statute
requires
is
not
that
it
refute
the
assertion
that
the
testimony
is
the
product
of
the
motive.
if
you
read
it
literally,
what
it
says
is
the
implied
charge
against
the
declarant
of
improper
influence
or
motive,
and
i
don't
see...
this
very
negligibly
refutes
the
existence
of
the
motive.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may...
it
may
more
substantially
refute
the
fact
that
she
testified
to
this
effect
because
she
wanted
to
be
with
her
mother,
but
how
does
it
refute
the
fact
that
she
wanted
to
be
with
her
mother?
i
don't--
