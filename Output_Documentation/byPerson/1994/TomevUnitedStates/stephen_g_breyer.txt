justice
stephen
g.
breyer
excuse
me,
may
i
say,
why
isn't
that
right?
that
is,
if
you
go
back,
assuming
the
language
is
ambiguous,
let's
assume
it's
ambiguous.
if
it
were
ambiguous,
you
say,
look
to
the
common
law.
if
you
look
to
the
common
law
at
that
time,
this
tended
to
be
treated
as,
you
had
to
be
a
premotive.
but
the
reason
it
had
to
be
premotive
was
because
the
courts
believed
that
if
it
wasn't
premotive,
it
wasn't
relevant.
so
then
when
you
codify
all
that,
why
wouldn't
now,
that
reason
being
what
it
was,
the
proper
thing
be
for
the
courts
to
look
at
this
problem
under
article
iv
of
the
rules
of
evidence,
which
has
to
do
with
relevance,
rather
than
article
viii,
which
has
to
do
with
hearsay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
just
happens
to
be,
but
i
mean,
they
recodified
the
thing.
the
language
permits
it.
why
wouldn't
you
go
back
to
the
purpose
of
what
was
going
on
and
say,
in
terms
of
the
purpose,
we'll
now
look
at
it
under
relevance,
and
you
could
have
said
under
this
case,
hey,
this
is
hardly
relevant,
and
the
prejudice
is
unbelievable,
and
therefore
keep
it
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
if
that's
so,
if
i
can...
this
is
what's
bothering
me
about
the
case.
as
i
understand
it,
if
you
proceed
under
this
hearsay
exception,
the
particular
one,
you
don't
proceed
under
the
catch-all,
to
get
in
under
the
catch-all,
particularly
because
of
the
confrontation
clause,
you
have
to
have
special
indicia
of
reliability.
in
this
case,
i
take
it,
because
of
this
exception,
you
don't,
but
you
say,
that's
okay,
because
what's
supposed
to
happen
here
is
just
what
you
read.
what's
supposed
to
happen
here
is
that
they're
supposed
to
over
to
article
iv,
to
the
regular
rules
on
relevance
versus
prejudice,
and
apply
that.
all
right,
so
i
can
understand
that
as
a
coherent
picture.
then
when
i
apply
it
to
this
case,
i
say,
did
that
happen
here?
my
goodness.
in
this
particular
case,
as
i
read
it,
there
is
a
child,
6
years
old,
who
is
in
the
court,
not
being
able
to
be
cross-examined
very
thoroughly
because
she
can't
answer
most
of
the
time,
and
then
when
you
look
back
at
this
particular
set
of
evidence,
if
the
relevancy
we're
supposed
to
look
to
is
the
relevancy
to
show
lack
of
a
motive,
all
these
statements
were
made
after
the
mother
took
the
child,
and
the
mother
could
have
told
the
child
in
the
car,
hey,
i
want
you
to
stay
with
me.
so
the
relevancy
seems
small,
and
if
you
look
at
the
prejudice,
it
looks
like
this
was
the
evidence
on
the
basis
of
which
the
defendant
was
convicted,
so
what
i
don't
understand
is,
if
in
fact
you're
supposed
to
read
this
provision
to
incorporate
or
at
least
refer
by
reference,
say,
judge,
look
at
this,
if
you're
just
saying
it
twice,
fine,
let
it
in
under
this
rule,
but
go
back
and
look
at
403.
that
didn't
seem
to
happen
here,
or
did
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
highly
probative
on
the
issue
for
which
it
was
offered,
highly
probative
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
motive
to
lie
by
the
witness?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--let
me
be
quite
specific,
then.
if
you're
reading
the
rules
in
hand,
should
we
then
say,
if
we
agree
with
you,
yes,
this
is
the
correct
way
to
interpret
these
rules,
but
we
can't
find
in
the
record
here
that
there
was
actually
an
explicit,
a
weighing
of
relevance
versus
prejudice,
and
had
there
been
such,
it
would
have...
might
have
come
out
differently?
is
that--
