justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
you
argue
in
that
case
that
the
adea
trumps
any
other
state
recovery
mechanism?
wouldn't
you
say
that
the
federal
policy
should
prevail,
and
therefore
there
shouldn't
be
a
recoupment?
justice
david
h.
souter
for
the
recovery
of
some
of
this
compensa...
backpay,
for
example?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
i
can
understand,
but
if
you're
talking
about
recovery
of
the
very
backpay
to
which
the
employee
is
entitled
under
the
act,
or
determined
by
the
court
to
be
entitled
under
the
act,
are
you
conceding
that
that
might
be
a
proper
subject
of
recovery
under
some
state
law
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
let
me
make
sure
i
understand.
i
take
it
you
are
saying
that
a
state
action
for
the
return
of
backpay
on
the
theory
that
backpay
is,
per
se,
unjust
enrichment
in
these
circumstances,
would
be
barred,
is
that
correct?
the
employer
could
not
simply
bring
an
unjust
enrichment
claim
to
recover
the
backpay
under
state
law
which
had
just
been
awarded
by
federal
court
under
this
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
wouldn't
your
argument
be
that
in
fact
the
state
law
was
barred
by
the
adea?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
what
if
it's
a
general
state
law
saying
no
one
shall
be
unjustly
enriched,
and
let's
assume
that
under
state
law
as
a
general
rule
the
payment
of
salary
to
someone
who
has
misrepresented
qualifications
for
the
office
for
which
the
salary
is
paid
would
be
a
proper
subject
for
unjust
enrichment
recovery,
would
you
say
that
the
adea
would
not
bar
that
state
law
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and
the
easy
claim
would
be
the
case
of
the
nonlawyer
lawyer
whose
firm
has
been
sued
for
malpractice
and
has
had
to
recover.
they
would
certainly
be
able
to
claim
against
the
nonlawyer
lawyer.
it
wouldn't
be
a
claim
for
the
return
of
backpay,
it
would
simply
be
a
claim
for
what
they
had
been
forced
to
pay
as
under
respondeat
superior.
that
would
be
easy.
they
could
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
don't
you
go
for
the
whole
hog
in
this
case,
because
in
this
case,
presumably
absent
discovery
the
employer
would
never
have
found
out
and
would
never
have
discharged
for
any
other
reason,
other
than
the
age
discrimination.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
wayland,
i
take
it
the
trial
court
went
no
further
than
to
say,
than
to
conclude
that
there
was
no
genuine
issue
on
the
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
legal
injury
has
got
to
be
defined
in
statutory
terms,
and
the
statute
uses
discharge
because
of
age.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
the
legal
injury,
and
if
there
has
been
a
discharge
because
of
age,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
statutory
language,
that
is
the
end
of
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
there
has
been
a
legally
cognizable
injury.
we
can
fight
about
relief
later,
but
the
injury
is
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
do
with
the
language,
because
of
age?
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
in
terms
of
what
is
properly
disputed,
isn't
it
a
relevant
fact
in
determining
whether
they
would
have
discharged
that
they
are
coming
forward
with
this
evidence
and
they
are
trying
to
prove
this
we
assume,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
after
they
have
violated
the
statute,
so
isn't
the
fact
of
the
statutory
violation
always
going
to
be
relevant
except
in
a
case
in
which
it's
stipulated
that
they
would
have
discharged
anyway?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
simply
goes
to
the
question
whether
you
can,
in
fact,
litigate
solely
your
affirmative
defense,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
case...
except
in
a
case
in
which
it
is
stipulated
that
there
would
have
been
a
discharge
absent
the
discrimination,
you
really
cannot
so
divide
the
issues,
because
the
one
is
relevant
to
your
determination
under
the
other.
