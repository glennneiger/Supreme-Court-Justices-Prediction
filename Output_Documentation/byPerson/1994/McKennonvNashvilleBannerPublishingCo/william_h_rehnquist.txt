we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
93-1543,
christine
mckennon
v.
nashville
banner
publishing
company.
mr.
terry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
still
was
somewhat
different
than
the
present
case,
wasn't
it?
wasn't
that
the
question
of
whether
the
person
was
an
employee
for
purposes
of
the
fela,
even
though
he
might
have
had
misinformation
on
his
application
form?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
respondent
doesn't
say
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
never
was
an
employee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
terry.
mr.
gornstein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
just
inserts
a
new
and
difficult
factual
inquiry
into
the
equation.
i
don't
see
much
to
commend
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
do
you
agree
that
it
does
insert
an
often
difficult
factual
question
into
the
equation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
chief
justice

chief

william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wayland.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
terry,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
to
announce.
the
first
is
number
93-1543
mckennon
versus
nashville
banner
publishing
company.
this
case
arises
under
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act.
an
employee
who
in
violation
of
the
act
is
discharged
because
of
age
discrimination
has
a
cause
of
action
against
the
employer,
and
for
some
30-years
petitioner
christen
mckennon
worked
for
respondent
nashville
banner
publishing
co.
when
she
was
62-years-old
the
banner
discharged
her,
the
banner
said,
her
discharge
was
part
of
a
workforce
reduction
plan.
mckennon
thought
that
her
age
was
the
reason
for
dismissal
and
she
filed
suit
under
the
act.
the
banner
took
mckennon’s
deposition
and
discovered
that
mckennon
had
copied
confidential
financial
records
and
had
removed
them
from
the
premises.
the
employer
claimed
this
misconduct
would
have
resulted
in
her
immediate
termination
had
it
been
discovered
earlier.
the
banner
claimed
that
mckennon’s
misconduct
was
sufficient
to
bar
her
from
all
relief
under
the
act
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
agreed
with
that
possession.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
kennedy
we
reverse
the
sixth
circuit
because
we
think
that
a
violation
of
the
act
can’t
be
totally
disregarded
that
way.
we
hold
that
the
beginning
point
in
the
trial
court’s
formulation
of
a
remedy
should
be
calculation
of
back
pay
from
the
date
of
the
unlawful
discharge
to
the
date
the
new
information
was
discovered.
in
determining
the
appropriate
order
for
relief
the
court
consider
taking
into
further
account
equitable
circumstances.
an
absolute
rule
baring
recovery
of
back
pay
however
we
think
undermines
the
objectives
of
the
act.
but
we
do
decide
that
in
this
case
as
a
general
rule
in
cases
of
this
type
neither
reinstatement
nor
front
pay
that
is
future
wages
is
an
appropriate
remedy
for
a
conduct
or
misconduct
would
have
resulted
in
terminations
and
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
