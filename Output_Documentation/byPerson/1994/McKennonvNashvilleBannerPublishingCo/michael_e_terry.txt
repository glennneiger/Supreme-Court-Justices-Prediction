mr.
michael
e.
terry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
case
is
about
age
discrimination.
particularly,
this
case
is
about
the
after-acquired
information
doctrine,
or
the
after-acquired
evidence
doctrine.
the
so-called
after-acquired
information
in
these
cases
varies,
but
it
bears
two
common
characteristics.
first,
the
information
is
acquired
after
a
questioned
employment
practice,
usually
after
litigation
has
begun.
second,
the
employer
contends
that
the
information
would
be
a
legitimate
basis
for
terminating
the
employee.
simply
stated,
the
issue
in
this
case
is,
what
significance
should
attach
to
such
after-acquired
evidence
in
cases,
in
discrimination
cases
arising
under
the
federal
civil
rights
statutes?
clearly,
there
are
two
camps.
the
sixth
circuit
and
other
courts
have
determined
that
such
after-acquired
evidence
is
a
complete
defense
to
liability
and
bars
all
relief.
the
third
circuit
and
other
courts
have
determined
that
after-acquired
evidence
is
not
a
defense
to
liability
but
may,
in
appropriate
cases,
impact
upon
relief.
we
come
to
this
court
with
the
notion
that
the
after-acquired
evidence
doctrine
is
nothing
new.
we
believe
that
for
more
than
30
years
this
court's
construing
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
agencies
construing
other
federal
statutes
have
been
confronted
with
the
after-acquired
defense
by
employers
seeking
to
avoid
liability
under
other
statutes
protecting
employees'
rights.
in
each
case,
beginning
with
still
v.
norfolk
&
western
railroad
in
1961,
this
court
and
the
other
courts
and
the
agencies
have
found
that
after-acquired
evidence,
as
a
defense,
does
not
bar
all
remedy.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
mr.
chief
justice,
still
was
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
and
it
was
a
case
involving
an
employee
seeing
compensation
for
a
back
injury,
and
there
was
a
question
about
information
that
he
had
provided
in
his
form,
but
he
railroad
in
still
took
the
position
that
he
was
not
an
employee,
not
qualified
to
be
an
employee.
the
respondent
in
this
case
takes
that
position,
and
so
do
some
of
the
courts
that
extend
the--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--no,
but
the
plaintiff
in
still
had
worked
for
norfolk
and
western
railroad
for
6
years,
just
like
the
plaintiff
here
had
worked
for
the
nashville
banner
for
40
years,
so
the
theory
that
somehow
the
misconduct
or
the
application
error
or
misstatement
has
removed
the
standing
or
the
qualification
was
the
same.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
justice
o'connor,
the
first...
in
answering
your
question,
and
maybe
you
have
already
suggested
that
we
think
the
first
and
very
important
part
of
this
rule
that
we
propose
is
that
the
employer
show
under
a
standard
similar
to
the
standard
in
price
waterhouse
that
they
would
have
terminated
the
employee.
they
must
show
this
by
objective
evidence
in
a
fair,
factfinding
proceeding.
if
that
is
done,
we
believe
that
the
remedies
should
be
fashioned
by
the
facts.
clearly,
if
the
employer
would
have
terminated
the
employee,
then
in
most
cases
reinstatement
and
front
pay
are
inappropriate,
but
we
do
not
believe
that
backpay
should
be
barred,
and
we
believe
that
their
backpay
should
be
awarded
in
most
cases,
and
awarded
to
the
point
of
judgment
to
satisfy
the...
to
satisfy
the
objectives
of
the
adea
and
title
vii.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
we...
the
answer
to
your
question
is
the
same.
we
propose
that
that
employee
should
receive
backpay
if
they
can...
if
they
can
establish
a
discrimination
claim,
but
the
fear
in
that
result,
and
the
problem
with
that
result,
is
removed
by
the
idea
that
the
employer
should
be
able
to
pursue
state
civil
and
criminal
remedies
to
recover
any
unjust
compensation
or
any
injury
that
the
employer
has
suffered,
so
in
these
extreme
cases,
when
we
talk
about
the
so-called
nondoctor
doctor,
or
the
case
where
the
day-care
worker
is
a
child
molester,
that
type
of
case
that
are
used
as
examples,
the
case,
the
facts
of
the
case
take
care
of
themselves.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
we
believe
that
the
counterclaim
may
be...
will
mostly
be
found
in
state
law.
if
the
counterclaim
is
in
state
law,
then
it
should
be
presented
as
a
defense,
or
a
counterclaim
in--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--yes,
exactly.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
absolutely.
there
would
be
no
money
exchanged
in
a
lot
of
these
cases
that
people
seem
to
be
afraid
about,
and
the
purposes
of
title
vii
and
adea
would
be
served
by--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--no.
our
position
is
that
if
the
employer
has
a
valid
state
law
claim,
and
i
might
mention
that
some
of
the
recoupment--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--or
it
could
be
a
situation,
let's
take
for...
where
the
employee
has
caused
some
actual
damage
or
injury
on
the
job.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
absolutely
not.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
absolutely
not.
we're
talking
about--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--absolutely.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
in
a
lot
of
these
cases,
that's
the
situation,
justice--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--yes,
and...
but
in
that
case
you
may
also
find
some
theory
of
unjust
enrichment,
and
you
will
also
find
that
the
local
district
attorney
will
probably
initiate
a
criminal
prosecution
just
like
they
would
in
the
nondoctor
doctor
situation,
and
part
of
the
criminal
prosecution
could
also
involve
restitution
of
part
of
the
money
that
was
received.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
you
can
get
it
back
if
there's
injury
and
if
there's
harm,
or
if
there's
some
viable
state
remedy
that
the
title--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--if--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--if...
if
the...
yes.
if
there
is
a...
we
do
not
believe
that
the
purpose
of
title...
i
think
this
court
has
said
in
cases
such
as
mcdonnell
douglas
and
mcdonald
v.
santa
fe
and
sure
tan
that
title
vii,
that
wrongdoing
by
an
employee
doesn't
remove
that
employee
from
the
protections
of
title
vii
and
adea.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
the
answer
to
that
question
is
if
the
state
law
was
passed
and
promoted
as
a
defense
to
title
vii,
then
it
would
have
those
problems.
if
there
was
a
valid
existing
state
remedy--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--if
that
was
the
purpose,
if
the
purpose
of
the
state
law
was
to
frustrate
the
purposes
of
adea,
or
title
vii,
then
it
would
have
problems.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
but
if--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--yes,
i
would,
but
i
would
also
say
that
it
would
be
my
understanding
of
that
claim
that
the
employee,
as
justice
kennedy
has
suggested,
if
they've
done
the
job,
if
the
employer
has
received
benefit
for
what
he's
paid,
that
the
unjust
enrichment
claim
would
not
succeed
to
the
extent
of
the
backpay.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
absolutely,
and
we
think--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--your
honor,
no.
we
believe
that
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
establish
the
title
vii
or
adea
claim
even
if
damages
is
completely
out
of
the
equation
because
of
unjust
enrichment
or
some
other
recovery.
there
is
other
relief
that
the
plaintiff
may
be
entitled
to,
or
that
the
defendant
should
be
affected
by
other
than
damages.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
absolutely,
under
the
appropriate
standard,
which
we
think
is
articulated
in
price
waterhouse,
where...
which
requires
objective
evidence
and
clear
issues
of
fact
which
were
present
in
this
case,
a
fair
factfinding
proceeding.
the
district
judge
in
this
case
found
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
nashville
banner
could
have
fired--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--i
didn't--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--we
have
raised
that
question.
that
question
is
in
our...
is
in
our
brief.
we
have--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--well--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--well,
justice
stevens,
our
approach
to
this
is
that
until
there
is
a
rule,
a
rule
articulated
by
this
court,
when
you
start
with
the
procedural
problems
that
are
presented
in
the
district
court,
the
problems
are
shown
in
this
case.
it's
not
something
that
just
occurs
as
soon
as
an
employer
says,
i
would
have
terminated.
it's
a
problem
in
determining
the
process
for
would
have
terminated--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--absolutely.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--when
judgment
runs
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
yes.
yes,
justice
o'connor,
and--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--we
think
that
the
eeoc
has
changed
its
ruling
in
that
area
a
couple
of
times.
we
don't
believe
that
a
rule
that
stops
short
of
judgment
will
serve
the
purposes
of
albemarle,
and
we
think
albemarle
is
served
if
backpay
runs
to
judgment.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
if
the
employer
can
demonstrate
that
absent
discrimination
they
would
have
found
out,
then
it's
just
as
if
the
plant
had
closed.
then
it
stops
at
that
point.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
the
reason
is
that
if
the...
anything
other
than
what
we
propose
allows
the
employer
to
improve
their
position
because
of
the
discrimination.
my
client
would
be
working
at
the
nashville
banner
today
except
for
the
discrimination.
the
discrimination
that
originally
terminated
her
also
leads
to
this
after-acquired
information,
and
to
cut
it
off
any
place
else
allows
the
nashville
banner
to
profit
from
that.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
well--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--because
they
don't
have
to
face
reinstatement
or
front
pay,
but
they
have
the
same
obligations
under
backpay,
and
backpay
is
critical.
as
this
court
said
before,
it's
the
spur,
it's
the
catalyst,
it
is
the
backbone
to
deterrence
and
compensation
under
albemarle,
and
we
do
concede
that
there
is
some
advantage
to
the
employer,
but
it
puts
the
employer
in
the
same
position
they
would
have
been
absent
the
discrimination.
if
they
have
a
legitimate
reason
at
that
point,
they
can
refuse
reinstatement.
we
do
think
that
this
rule
balances
the
employer
and
employee
interests.
the
rule
proposed
by
the
nashville
banner
is
a
rule
that
establishes
a
predetermined
national
penalty.
it's
a
rule
that
says
no
matter
what
the
conduct,
here's
the
penalty.
you've
lost
your
right
to
bring
a
civil
rights
claim,
and
the
penalty
is
the
same
in
every
case,
no
matter
what
the
misconduct
is,
and
that's
a--
mr.
michael
e.
terry
--the
rule
we
proposed,
your
honor,
is
structured
with
regard
to
reinstatement
and
front
pay
to
accommodate
the
employer's
interest.
we
don't
believe
that
title
vii
should
overreach
to
the
point
where
it
implicates
the
future
and
requires
two
people
who
now
have
a
legitimate
reason
not
to
be
tied
in
this
relationship
to
be
in
that
relationship.
mr.
michael
e.
terry
justice
ginsburg,
there
are
questions
of
fact
in
this
case.
my
client
worked
there
40
years.
the
affidavit
signed
by
the
publisher
in
december,
where
he
said
he
would
have
fired
her
on
march
6th,
1992,
several
months
later
in
his
deposition,
he
could
not
identify
the
documents
that
were
taken.
she
was
positively
evaluated
for
40
years.
there
are
fact
questions
on
whether
or
not
they
would
have
fired
her.
your
honor,
i've
nothing
further.
