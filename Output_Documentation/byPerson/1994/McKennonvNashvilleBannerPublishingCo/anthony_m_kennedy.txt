well,
it
could
be
a
pendant
cause
of
action,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then,
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
it
would
be
an
offset
to
the
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
employer
would
have
to
prove
damage,
i
take
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
if
the
person
holds
himself
out
as
a
lawyer,
and
in
fact
is
not
a
lawyer,
and
they
discover
that,
if
he
had
been
doing
his
job
adequately
and
the
employer
hadn't
been
sued,
i
take
it
no
damage
under
your
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
despite
the
fact
that
it's
somewhat
outrageous
that
the
person
held
himself
out
as
a
lawyer
and
in
fact
was
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
submission
that
the
time
runs
at
the...
when
judgment
is
entered
in
the
trial
court
or
when
the
judgment
becomes
final
after
appeal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
true
even
under
your
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
but
for
the
lawsuit
this
never
would
have
been
found
out,
so
even
under
your
rule
she...
the
employer
is
better
off
because
of
the
discharge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
our
discretion
is
unguided.
is
the
law
in
such
a
beginning
primitive
state
that
we
can't
call
a
thief
a
thief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
unguided
discretion
to
allow
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
allow
that
to
shape
the
remedy
that
we
provide?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
submission
is
there
be
no
discretion
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
whatever
the
deficiencies,
the
question
presented
at
least
does
assume
that
the
conduct
here
would
have
provided
a
basis
for
dismissing
the
employee.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
we
take
the
case
on
that
assumption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
is
not
much
to
argue
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
have
other
questions
similar
to
justice
stevens.
suppose
that
the
evidence
of
discrimination
is
very
clear,
smoking
gun
in
the
record.
we
fire
you
because
of
your
age.
that's
in
the
complaint
in
the
pretrial
stage,
you
now
go
to
the
district
court,
and
you
say,
your
honor,
we
want
to
take
discovery,
because
there
is
some
indication
here
that
this
employee
may
have
been
incompetent.
under
your
rule,
that
discovery
has
to
be
allowed?
