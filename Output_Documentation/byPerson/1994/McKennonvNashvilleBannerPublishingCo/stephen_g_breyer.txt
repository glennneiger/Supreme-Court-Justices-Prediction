all
right.
then
how
is
it...
imagine
the
employee
is
dismissed
on
day
1,
because
of
age.
the
employer
says,
you're
too
old.
i'm
firing
you.
during
the
discovery,
10
months
later,
they
discover
that
this
employee
has
been
stealing
all
the
money
in
the
company,
i
mean,
totally
dishonest
crook,
and
they
never
would
have
found
it
without
the
discovery.
the
judgment
takes
place
a
year
after
that.
you're
saying
that
this
employee
who
was
stealing
them
blind
should
receive
backpay
not
only
for
the
first
10
months
before
they
discovered
it
but
also
for
the
next
14
until
judgment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
couldn't
show
he
discovered...
he
never
would
have
found
out--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
yet
there
is
this
word,
equitable,
in
the
statutory
section
dealing
with
relief.
how
is
that
equitable?
they
don't...
i
mean,
i
take
it
that
the...
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
my
question.
it
would
seem
in
that
circumstance,
contrary
to
the
sixth
circuit,
that
the
employee
should
get
paid
for
the
first
10
months
before
they
found
it,
perhaps,
but
why
the
next
14?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
go
to
the
point,
which
might
not
be
in
the
case
question,
but
nonetheless
is
bothering
me,
on
day
1,
the
person's
fired
because
of
age,
10
months
later,
in
discovery,
they
find
out
the
person
was
a
terrible
thief,
and
14
months
after
that,
judgment
enters.
assume,
contrary
to
everything
you've
been
arguing,
but
just
assume
it
with
me,
that
i
don't
really
think
congress
wanted
to
subject
people
who've
made
complaints
to
inquisitions
about
every
feature
of
their
past
life,
and
therefore
you're
going
to
lose
on
that
point.
i'm
saying,
just
make
an
assumption.
the
point
that's
bothering
me
then,
on
that
assumption,
is
whether
the
damages
should
run
to
10
months
when
the
thing
turns
up,
or
run
to
2
years
because
it
wouldn't
have
turned
up
in
the
absence
of
this
case.
that's
what
i'd
appreciate
your
addressing,
you
see,
because
you
could
make
the
same
argument
about
not
subjecting
people
to
inquisitions.
if
you're
going
to
permit
that
employer
to
stop
his
damages
once
he
finds
out
this
thing
on
discovery,
that
also
would
encourage
inquisitions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking
you
to
address
the
point
of
when,
in
your
opinion,
if
you
lost
on
your
main
point,
the
damages
would
be
stopped,
and
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
understand,
i'm
making
the
assumption
that
you
lose
on
that
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
making
the
assumption
that
for
argument's
sake
that
our
choice
is
between
stopping
it
at
the
time
the
employer
discovers
it,
or
letting
the
damages
run,
despite
the
discovery,
until
judgment
enters.
now,
you
don't
have
to
address
that,
because
you
might
say,
since
that
whole
assumption's
wrong
and
so
forth...
i
understand
that,
but
if
you
want
to
address
that,
i'd
appreciate
it.
