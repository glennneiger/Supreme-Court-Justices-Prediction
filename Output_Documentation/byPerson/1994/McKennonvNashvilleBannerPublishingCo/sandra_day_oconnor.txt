justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
remedies,
mr.
terry,
do
you
say
are
available
to
the
petitioner
if
it
is
discovered
during
the
course
of
the
discovery
proceedings
that
valid
cause
existed
for
the
employer
to
fire
the
petitioner?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
situation
of
an
employer
discovering
that
there
was
a
fraudulent
employment
application,
that
a
qualification
for
the
job,
for
example,
was
a
certain
education
degree,
and
the
employee
had
fraudulently
said
she
had
that
degree,
and
it's
later
discovered.
now,
what
kind
of
relief
there,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
some
circuits
say
that
the
cutoff
date
is
when
the
employer
actually
discovers
the
grounds
for
discharge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
what
the
eeoc
has
used
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
gornstein,
what
should
the
cutoff
date
be
for
any
so-called
backpay
relief?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
kind
of
a
hard
test
to
employ.
don't
you
think
that...
isn't
it
true
that
the
eeoc
has
used,
and
perhaps
now
uses,
a
cutoff
date
of
when
the
employer
actually
discovers
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
it
using
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
very
difficult
in
this
case.
it
could
be
argued
that
absent
this
litigation
the
employer
never
would
have
discovered
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
at
the
time
of
the
discharge
of
the
petitioner,
the
employer
did
not
know
of
any
other
ground
for
discharge,
and
i
guess
we
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
discharge
was
made
at
that
time
on
the
basis
of
her
age.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
purposes
of
our
disposal
of
this
case
we
take
it
on
that
assumption,
do
we
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
as
of
that
date,
it
appears
that
there
was
indeed
discrimination
as
described
in
the
statute,
and
an
injury
occurred
on
that
date.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
wayland,
i
would
have
thought
you
would
look
at
the
situation
at
the
time
the
employment
action
occurred,
and
that's
what
congress
was
trying
to
prevent.
they
don't
want
employment
action,
a
discharge,
based
on
the
employee's
race
or
sex
or
age,
and
they're
trying
to
discourage
that
kind
of
action,
so
i
don't
see
how
your
rule
implements
the
goal
of
the
statute
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
not
if
you
look
at
it,
for
example,
as
of
the
date
of
the
acquisition
of
the
subsequent
knowledge.
then
it
looks
to
me
like
you
can
sort
out
the
appropriate
remedy.
