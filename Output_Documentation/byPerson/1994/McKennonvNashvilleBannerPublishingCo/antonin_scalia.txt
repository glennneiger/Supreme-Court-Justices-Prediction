justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now
you're
causing
me
to
get
confused
again.
i
thought
that
you
told
justice
souter
you
can't
get
the
backpay
back.
you
say
you
can't
get
it
back
as
backpay,
but
you
can
get
it
back
as
restitution,
or
as
unjust
enrichment?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can
get
the
backpay
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
need
a
state
cause
of
action
for
unjust
enrichment
or
for
restitution,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
claim
for
what,
a
claim
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
get
his
money
back
that's
been
stolen?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
still
paying
this
guy
wages.
he
would
never
get
those
wages
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
seem
equitable
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
does
use
the
word
equitable,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
whatever...
whatever
helps
to
further
the
purposes
of
the
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says,
equitable.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
best
advances,
it
says
such
legal...
as
may
be
appropriate,
right?
the
question
is
whether
this
kind
of
relief
is
appropriate
to
advance
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
some
people
may
think
it's
inappropriate?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
criminal?
couldn't
we
at
least
draw
the
line,
criminal,
if
there's
criminal
misconduct?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
pretty
clear
line.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
so
therefore
we
have
to
let
even
larceny
go
unpunished
because
there
are
some
things
that
aren't
criminal
that
are
serious.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wayland,
suppose
what
was
at
issue
here
was
not
intentional
misconduct,
but
simply
gross
incompetence
that
the
employer
had
not
theretofore
been
aware
of,
but
it
comes
out
during
the
course
of
the
trial
that
this
employee
is
really
grossly
incompetent,
would
that
in
your
view
lead
to
the
same
conclusion,
that
no
recovery
could
be
had
for
firing
this
employee
because
of
race,
or
sex,
or
age?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it
may
well.
[laughter]
i
want
to
know
what
your
answer
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
had
it
known
about
the
incompetency.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
a
matter
of
intentional
misconduct
alone,
it's
if
there
were
any
reason
for
which
this
employee
might
have
been,
would
have
been
discharged
had
the
employer
known
about
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
gather--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
bring
a
suit
under
this
statute
you
better
expect
your
employment
history
to
be
very
carefully
scrutinized
not
only
for
intentional
misdeeds
but
for
general
incompetence?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
be
rather
risky,
wouldn't
it,
to
bring
such
a
suit?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
the
employer
is
unable
to
establish
the
general
incompetence,
it
would
make
good
reading
for
any
subsequent
employer,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
running
two
theories,
mr.
wayland,
and
i
think
you're
going
to
have
to
pick
between
them.
one
is
that
there's
simply
no
cause
of
action
because
there's
been
no
harm
done,
and
if
you
run
that
theory,
you
do,
indeed,
have
to
answer
my
earlier
question
about
whether
even
an
incompetent
employee
is
not
entitled
to
relief,
the
way
you
did.
incompetence,
just
like
intentional
misdoing,
eliminates
the
cause
of
action.
but
there
is
a
second
theory
which
you
seem
to
be
running
in
your
discussion
with
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
is,
it
doesn't
go
to
whether
there's
a
claim
at
the
outset,
but
to
whether
relief
is
appropriate,
and
under
that
theory
you
could
get
a
declaratory
judgment.
but
there's
no
basis
for
a
declaratory
judgment
under
your
first
theory,
that
there's
simply
no
cause
of
action.
that
is,
no
harm
has
been
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
which
theory
do
you
want?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought
your
brief
contained,
the
first
theory,
not
the
remedial
theory.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
there
no
injury?
look,
i'm
a
thoroughly
incompetent
employee,
but
my
employer
has
not
tumbled
to
that
fact
yet.
[laughter]
i'm
drawing
a
nice
salary,
week
by
week,
and
i
get
fired
because
of
my
age.
why
haven't
i
suffered
an
injury?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
you...
it's
not
self-evident
to
me.
you
simply
say
that
there
has
been
no
injury,
but
de
facto,
there
certainly
has
been
an
injury.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
wasn't
the
cause.
the
employer
didn't
know
about
my
incompetence.
he
only
found
out
about
it
later
because
of
this
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
goes
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
remedy,
but
it
doesn't
go
to
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action.
it
does
not
go
to
whether
there
was
any
injury.
it
seems
to
me
the
more
incompetent
i've
been,
the
more
dishonest
i
am,
and
hence
less
likely
to
get
a
later
job,
the
more
i've
been
injured.
[laughter]
