justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
didn't
raise
that
question
in
the
petition.
you
didn't
raise
that
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
didn't
raise
that
question
in
your
certiorari
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
know
it's
in
your
brief,
but
not
in
your--
--it
wasn't
in
the
petition.
not
in
your
certiorari
petition.
you
just
raised
your
basic
legal
argument.
you
only
have
one
question
in
your
certiorari
petition,
and
it
did
not
include
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
be
right
on
it,
but
i'm
not
sure
you
preserved
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
understand,
but
your
principal
argument
is
that
even
if
they
clearly
would
have
fired
her
for
this
conduct,
you
still
say
that
she's
entitled
to
recover
under
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
question
you
primarily
addressed,
at
least.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gornstein,
can
i
interrupt
with
this
question?
do
you
think
the
remedy
issue
is
embraced
within
the
question
presented
in
the
cert
petition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
only
relates
to
liability
in
all
three
briefs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
first
have
to
decide
whether
there's
liability,
and
that's
the
only
issue
that
the
cert
petition
raised.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
the
remedy
should
be
if
she
wins?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
you
don't
have
to
decide
which
of
the
various
alternatives
would
be
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
there's
some...
some--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
clearly
all
that
we
should
properly
decide
under
the
question
presented,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wayland,
could
i
interrupt
for
just
a
second?
i
want
to
get
one
thought
on
the
table.
isn't
it
true
that
in
the
orderly
presentation
of
a
trial
the
plaintiff
puts
her
evidence
in
first,
she
puts
in
the
evidence
that
she
was
a
loyal
employee,
she
was
fired,
fired
because
of
age,
and
she
lost
her
job.
prima
facie,
she
has
established
injury,
and
she
rests.
nobody
says
anything
about
this
that's
found
out
later.
then,
in
your
case,
you
put
this
evidence
on,
but
is
it
not
true
that
at
the
time
she
completes
her
case,
she
has
established
injury,
and
then
you
come
up
with
an
affirmative
defense,
trying
to
say,
well,
you
really
didn't
get
hurt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
she's
lost
her
job.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
put
in
no
evidence
at
that
point,
judgment
would
be
entered
against
you.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
guess,
is
no
matter
how
serious
your
misconduct
was,
and
we
assume,
of
course,
it
was
serious
enough
to
justify
discharge,
it
didn't
cause
any
pecuniary
damage
to
the
employer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
did
not
cause
any
pecuniary,
not
even
a
nickel
of
damages
to
the
employer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
just
told
her
husband
some
company
secrets,
basically.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
understand.
