do
they
do
that
by
way
of
a
counterclaim?
would
the
offset
be
on
the
employer's
part...
you
said
you
imagine,
you
could
imagine
a
case
where
civil,
even
criminal
liability,
but
let's
take
the
civil.
would
that
come
into
the
very
same
case,
the
discrimination
case,
by
way
of
counterclaim?
how
would
it
play
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
a
judge
in
such
an
instance
determine
the
order
of
trial
and
say,
i'm
going
to
try
the
counterclaim
first,
and
that
may
render
any
discrimination
claim
academic
because
of
the
size
of
the
damages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
take
you
back
just
one
step
to
clarify,
if
i
understand
correctly,
that
even
if
you
lose
on
your
main
argument
you
are
contesting
the
propriety
of
summary
judgment
here,
because
it
was...
you
were
not
given
an
opportunity
to
challenge
whether
this
misconduct
would
in
fact
have
led
to
the
discharge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
rule
that
backpay
would
terminate
when
the
employer
would
have
found
out,
which
could
conceivably
be
never?
that's
one
of
the
cutoffs
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
suppose
the
employer
can't
prove
that?
i
mean,
you
are
suggesting
a
cutoff
that
we
can
determine
a
fixed
time
when
the
judgment
becomes...
when
the
judgment
is
entered
in
the
district
court.
another
cutoff
could
be
when
the
employer
finds
out
in
the
course
of
discovery.
another
could
be
when,
absent
the
litigation,
the
employer
could
have
found
out.
what
reason
would
we
have
for
picking
one
or
the
other
of
those
stopping
points?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
employer's
claim?
wouldn't
the
employer
have
a
very
good
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
ease
of
administrability,
is
that
taken
into
account
at
all?
you
can
say,
you
don't
know...
you
would
have
to
have
a
kind
of
a
satellite
trial
on
this
question
of
when
would
the
employer
have
found
out.
you
are
accepting
mr.
terry's
outer
limit
of
the
day
of
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then,
if
you
take
the
day
of
discovery,
that's
something
fixed,
and
you
don't
have
to
quarrel
about
it,
apart
from
any
equitable
clean
hands
doctrine.
it's
easy
to
administer
that
kind
of
rule,
and
your
rule
is
difficult,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
didn't
have
an
"undeniably"
case
before
it
though,
did
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
conduct
was
undeniable,
but
what
would
have
followed
from
it,
whether
her
employment
would
have
terminated,
was
a
debatable
fact
question,
was
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
undisputed
facts,
there
were
only
affidavits,
no
cross-examination,
even.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
a
deposition
the
same
thing
as
presenting
a
witness
before
a
trier
of
fact
who
will
then
take
into
account
the
credibility
of
the
witness?
couldn't
a
witness...
couldn't...
well,
you
see
the
point
of
my
question.
a
deposition
is
not
the
same
as
presenting
a
witness
in
court
before
the
trier
of
fact,
subject
to
cross-examination.
it
didn't
have
that
setting
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
was
the
case,
in
fact
where
there's
a
credibility
question
to
be
resolved,
then
you
do
not
have
a
case
where
there
is
no
genuine
doubt
of
what
the
facts
are.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
it
shown
what
had
happened
in
similar
situations,
or
was
the
testimony
just
that,
yes,
we
would
have
fired
her?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wayland,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
this
is
a
statute
that
says,
thou
shalt
not
discriminate.
as
you
describe
this
scenario,
you
are
turning
that
around
and
say,
well,
let's
just
assume
that,
arguendo,
this
case
is
going
to
be
about
whether
this
was
an
inadequate
employee.
and
you
have
turned
what
congress
set
up
as
a
discrimination
claim
into
something
where
the
discrimination
claim
never
even
sees
the
light
of
day
unless
the
employee
can
first
survive
this
hurdle
of
showing
that
she
would
have
kept
the
job
that
she
was
a
competent
employee,
that
she
had
not
engaged
in
any
misconduct,
so
it
seems
to
me
just
destructive
of
the
claim
that
congress
set
up
when
it
passed
these
antidiscrimination
laws.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
even
a
matter
of
a
declaratory
judgment?
employer
discharged
this
person
for
an
impermissible
reason.
that
has
been
proved.
the
lawyer
who
proved
it
against
the
employer
is
going
to
get
counsel
fees.
just
that
much.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
how
can
you
give
summary
judgment
and
not
even
have
that
proof
in
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
starting
point
is,
we
can
concede
the
violation.
you
have
no
claim
if
you
engage
in
the
kind
of
misconduct
that
would
have
led
to
your
termination
anyway.
i
thought
your
starting
premise
is,
we
can
concede
arguendo
that
there
was
age
discrimination,
but
it
doesn't
matter,
because
you
don't
have
a
claim
for
relief
unless
you
show
that
you
would
not
have
been
terminated
for
another
reason.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
had
not
understood
the
price
waterhouse
decision
to
involve
the
scenario
here,
that
is,
that
there
is
never
any
proof
of
discrimination
because
we
go
right
to
the
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
makes
this
one
a
case
where,
less
sympathetic
to
the
discrimination
charge?
they
both
occur
simultaneously,
then
there
is
proof
of
the
discrimination.
if
they...
the
one
occurs
later,
there
should
be
a
different
trial
scenario.
i
don't
comprehend
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
it
makes
any
difference
whether
they
knew,
on
the
very
day
they
discriminated
against
her
on
the
basis
of
her
age
they
also
knew,
say
another
officer
knew
that
she
had
taken
confidential
documents.
why
should
it
turn
on
whether
the
discovery
was
simultaneous
or
the
discovery
of
misconduct
came
later?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wayland,
can
we
just
go
back
to
the
question,
the
liability
question,
the
basic
claim?
suppose
this
case
had
been
one
where
there
was
clear
proof
of
a
pattern
and
practice
established
at
the
top
level
of
this
company
that
we
don't
want
old
secretaries
around
this
place,
so
we're
going
to
get
rid
of
them
all,
and
there's
a
memo
from
the
boss
saying,
look
for
flaws,
look
for
faults,
and
then
we'll
be
able
to
have
a
reason
to
dismiss
them.
you
have
such
a
case,
and
the
plaintiff
copies
certain
confidential
documents,
just
what
happened
here.
would
you
say
even
then
there
is
no
claim
for
relief,
even
if
you
had
the
clearest,
wilful
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you...
can
you
just
explain
one
thing
that
i
don't
understand
clearly?
in
the
mount
healthy
setting,
in
the
price
waterhouse
setting,
you
have
the
plaintiff
putting
on
a
case.
here,
you
say,
we
can
win
without
the
plaintiff
ever
putting
on
a
case.
it's
that
difference.
that
was
not
happening
in
mount
healthy,
it
was
not
happening
in
price
waterhouse,
but
with
your
case
and
others
like
it,
the
plaintiff
never
makes
a
prima
facie
case.
we
never
have
that
showing.
that's
something
different,
and
would
you
explain
to
me
why,
in
the
mount
healthy
setting,
in
the
price
waterhouse
setting,
you
do
have
the
plaintiff's
case,
and
then
the
answer
to
it.
here,
we
have
the
answer
and
we
just
assume
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying,
then,
if
you
don't
have
a
summary
judgment
case
on
the
defense,
then
under
your
theory,
suppose
the
employer
says,
objectively
there
were
grounds
for
discharging
her
but
there's
a
dispute
whether
they
would
in
ract
have,
could,
in
your
view
of
this
kind
of
case,
the
trial
judge
say,
well,
i'm
going
to
have
a
trial
on
that,
because
if
i
find
that
they
would
have
fired
her
for
a
reason
for
which
they
could
have
fired
her,
i
save
everybody
a
lot
of
time,
because
that's
totally
dispositive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
could
do
the
same
thing
in
price
waterhouse,
and
the
same
thing
in
the
mount
healthy
setting
as
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
mount
healthy
type
case,
the
mixed
motive
case,
you
could
do
the
very
same
thing,
say,
i'm
going
to
have
a
trial
on
the
defense
first,
and
we'll
never
have
a
trial
on
the
discrimination
part
because
that
becomes
irrelevant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't
you
move
for
summary
judgment?
then
you
couldn't
have
thought
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
an
affirmative
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
so...
but
you
think
the
better
practice
would
have
been
to
reject
your
motion
and
say
well,
let's
have
a
trial
first
and
then
decide
it?
