mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
below
properly
held,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
employee
misconduct
and
evidence
of
employee
misconduct
that
undeniably
would
have
resulted
in
the
termination
of
the
plaintiff
had
the
company
known
about
it
bars
this
plaintiff's,
or
similarly
situated
plaintiffs'
claim
for
relief
for
wrongful
discharge.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
yes,
your
honor.
the
facts
in
this
case
show
it
was
admitted
that
it
was
misconduct.
the
plaintiff
in
her
deposition
admitted
she
knew
that
she
could
be--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
the
court
below
found,
on
the
basis
of
the
undisputed
facts,
that--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--no,
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
there
was.
there
were
depositions
of
all
four
of
the
individuals
who
submitted
affidavits.
the
court
below,
on
the
plaintiff's
motion,
extended
the
discovery
period,
gave
them
the
opportunity
to
depose
all
of
the
executives,
to
try
to
prove
pretext,
or
prove
that
the
company
would
not
have
done
what
the
executive
said
they
did,
and
no
evidence,
absolutely
no
evidence
came
forward
to
show
that.
it's
a
finding
of
fact,
uncontradicted
in
the
record,
that
she
would
have
been
terminated,
and
the
only
reason
she
wasn't
terminated
is
because
she
successfully
concealed
her
misconduct.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
well,
your
honor,
if
that's
the
standard,
then
there
could
never
be
summary
judgment
in
any
case
where
someone
could
argue
that
credibility
of
witnesses
may
be
appropriate.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
i
believe
the
teachings
of
this
court
establish,
your
honor,
that
when
faced
with
a
properly
supported
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
person
opposing
the
motion
has
to
come
forward
with
evidence
that
would
show
that
there
is
a
genuine
factual
dispute.
that
did
not
happen
here.
there
is
no
evidence
showing
that
there
is
a
genuine
factual
dispute,
and
it's
certainly
consistent
with
this
court's
standards
and
with
controlling
law
for
a
court
to
grant
summary
judgment
on
those
principles
and
on
those
facts.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
the
testimony
was,
your
honor,
that
there
was
no
similar
situations
to
compare
it
to,
that
it
had
never
happened
before,
that
the
rule
at
the
company
was
so
well
understood...
in
fact,
the
plaintiff
admitted
that
anyone
would
know
that
if
you
did
this
you
could
be
discharged
for
it,
and
the
company
in
the
testimony
was
that
they
would
have
unequivocally
terminated
the
employee
the
minute
they
found
out
about
it.
four
different
executives
testified
to
that
under
oath,
your
honor,
and
not
one
shred
of
evidence
contradicts
that.
on
those
facts,
we
think
it's
a
matter
of
fact
that
she
would
have
been
terminated.
it
was
a
fact
that
she
had
engaged
in
this
misconduct
at
the
time
that
she
was
chosen
for
a
lay-off.
those
facts
are
undeniable.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
the
trial
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
genuine
issue,
your
honor,
and
also
further
concluded
that,
on
the
basis
of
the
undisputed
facts,
that
the
company
had
objectively
stated
a
legitimate
cause
for
discharge.
i
believe
the
court
said
that
it
would
be
cause
for
discharge
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
court
then
went
further
and
said,
on
the
basis
of
the
undisputed
facts,
not
only
was
it
objectively
cause
for
discharge,
but
the
company
subjectively
would
have
discharged
the
employee
on
these
situations.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
and
if
you
look
at
what's
happened
here,
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
and
we
submit
that's
the
place
to
start,
in
the
age
discrimination
act,
congress
pecifically
provided
that
if
someone...
if
there's
good
cause
for
termination,
or
if
there's
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age,
then
that
is
not
age
discrimination.
congress
also
provided
that
a
person
must
be
aggrieved
to
bring
a
claim.
what
the
plaintiffs
are
trying
to
argue
here
is,
simply
because
there's
bad
motive,
that
therefore
that's
a
violation
of
the
law,
and
the
teachings
of
this
court
are
that
that's
not
enough.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
for
purposes
of--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
well,
the
question,
we
submit,
your
honor,
is,
did
an
injury
occur
on
that
date,
a
legal
injury,
and
if
so,
even
assuming
that
it
did,
is
it
redressable,
and
that's
the
real...
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
what
the
plaintiffs
and
the
government
are
trying
to
read
into
the
statute
is
the
word
shall,
that
this
court
shall
provide
a
remedy,
and
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
says,
in
the
court's
discretion,
when
it's
appropriate,
a
remedy
may
be
provided.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
it
may
well
lead
to
that
conclusion,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--well,
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
the
employer.
the
test
that
we
submit,
your
honor,
is
applicable
is,
are
there
undisputed
facts,
is
that...
would
that
be
an
objective
reason
for
discharge,
and
can
the
company
prove
it
would
have
terminated
the
employee--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--had
it
known
about
the
incompetency.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
statute
says,
good
cause.
it
doesn't
define
good
cause,
but
it
says
good
cause,
and
in
enacting
the
discrimination
laws
and
the
age
discrimination
act,
congress
was
very
sensitive
to
the
employer's
right
to
exercise
its
legitimate
prerogatives
except
for
when...
a
discriminatory
motive--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--that
resulted
in
an
injury.
excuse
me.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
well,
your
honor,
i
guess
there's
protective
orders
that
would
deal
with
that.
but
the
point,
your
honor,
is
that
the...
you
look
at
the
conduct
and
what
the
employer
would
have
done,
and
whether
or
not
that
rises
to
the
level
of
actual
discrimination.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
well,
your
honor,
it's
also
a
goal
of
the
statute
not
to
reward
bad
employees,
and
if
you
buy
the
plaintiff's
theory,
if
you
ignore
the
fact
of
the
misconduct
that
would
have
resulted
in
their
termination,
then
the
result
is
you
are
rewarding
an
employee
for
their
stealth
and
for
the
concealment
of
their
misconduct.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
well,
the
employee
is
still
being
rewarded,
your
honor,
because
that's
going
to,
employees
that
conceal
it
better
than
others
are
going
to
be
rewarded
more,
because
it's
going
to
take
longer
for
the
company
to
find
out
about
it.
it
might
also,
we
submit,
foster
a
situation
where
there's
more
deceptiveness
in
the
discovery
process.
what
we
submit--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--the
question,
your
honor,
is
to
relief.
congress
did
not
guarantee
that
every
plaintiff
who
could
prove
a
violation
is
going
to
get
a
remedy.
this
court
has
recognized
this
in
albemarle
paper
case.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
your
honor,
this
court,
under
my
reading
of
the
statute,
would
have
the
discretion
to
award
that
if
it
found
that
that
was
appropriate,
and
that
would
certainly
be
consistent
with
what
congress
has
enacted
in
the
1991
civil
rights
act.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
well,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
in
the
cases
that
we're
dealing
with
when
we're
dealing
with
misconduct
serious
enough
to
warrant
discharge,
that
would
have
warranted
discharge,
that
that
ends
the
inquiry,
because
the...
that
conduct
becomes
a
superseding
cause
for
any
injury.
there's
no
relief,
or
the
redressability
question
comes
into
play.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
well,
we
would
submit
that
the
first
theory
is
the
correct
one.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
but
if
the
court
determines
that
there
is
a
violation,
then
we
think
you
have
to
go
to
the
remedial
theory
as
a...
a,
for
lack
of
a
better
term,
a
fall-back
position,
and
that's
certainly
appropriate
then.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
your
honor,
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
the
price
waterhouse
case
is
there
are
three
things
that
are
necessary
for
a
legally
cognizable
injury
under
the
discrimination
law.
there
has
to
be
a
bad
motive,
which
we
are
assuming
for
purposes
of
argument
here,
there
has
to
be
an
action
pursuant
to
that
bad
motive,
and
there
has
to
be
an
injury.
there
has
to
be
a
tangible,
economic
injury
that
results
before
there
is
liability.
now,
that's
the
teaching
of
this
court--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--the
difference
between
the
price
waterhouse
scenario
and
this
one,
your
honor,
in
the
abstract,
we
submit,
is
that
in
price
waterhouse
both
motives
were
present
at
the
same
time,
whereas
in
this
case
by
definition
the
after-acquired
knowledge
was
not
present
at
the
time
the
decision
was
made,
but
once
you
set
that
aside--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--well,
your--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--i
don't
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
that's
the
point.
it
turns
on
whether
or
not
there's
an
injury,
and
here,
the
misconduct
that
would
have
resulted
in
her
termination
becomes
a
superseding
event
that
results
in--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--well,
your
honor,
you
haven't
suffered
a
legally
cognizable
injury
under
the
discrimination
laws.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
there
is
an
injury,
but
there
is
a
superseding
cause,
or
another
cause
of
that
injury.
that's
the
teaching
of
mount
healthy,
your
honor.
in
the
mount
healthy
case--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--well,
your
honor,
it
was
a
fact
at
the
time,
and
if
the
court
ignores
the
existence
of
that
fact
simply
by
a
lack
of
employer
knowledge,
then
it
is
rewarding
employees
for
their
concealment
of
misconduct,
and
that's
not--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--well,
your
honor,
again,
we
submit
that
in
terms
of
looking
at
the
legal
injuries,
this
court
has
said
there
has
to
be
a
tie,
it
has
to
be
traceable
to
the
event.
but
turning
to--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
we
believe
the
proper
test
is,
is
there
has
to
be
a
but-for
causation,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
proper
interpretation
is,
that's
a
but-for
test.
but
for
the
discrimination,
the
injury
would
not
have
occurred,
that
the
after-acquired
evidence
which
was
a
fact
at
the
time
that
the
court
should
look
at,
we
submit
the
court
should
look
at
the
plaintiff
as
they
stand,
not
the
issue
they
try
to
raise.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
i
don't
know
that
she's
established
injury,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
she's
established
a
presumption
that
the
loss
of
her
job
was
the
result
of
discrimination.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
here,
using
your
example,
the
after-acquired
evidence
and
what
we're
talking
about
here
goes
to
that
case.
we
think
it's
a
flip
side,
and
one
of
the
argument's
we
made
in
our
brief.
she
was
not
otherwise
qualified.
she
stole
from
her
employee.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
discovery
is
governed
by
the
normal
discovery
principles,
and
it
would
be
job-related
discovery.
i
don't
think
anything
suggests--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor,
is
the
damages
should
be
stopped
as
of
the
time
that
the
employee
engaged
in
the
misconduct,
or
the
alleged
injury
occurred,
so
it
would
be
the
time
of
the
lay-off,
because
otherwise
what
the
court
is
doing
is
rewarding
an
employee
for
their
misconduct.
moreover--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
your
honor,
on
your
assumption,
then
the
damages
should
stop
when
the
employer
learned
of
the
misconduct,
because
if
not,
then
this
court
is
ignoring
the
teachings
of
mount
healthy
and
its
progeny
that
a
plaintiff
should
not
be
better
off
because
they
raise
a
discrimination
claim.
if
we
had
found
out
about
ms.
mckennon's
misconduct
in
another
lawsuit,
or
some
employee
came
forward
and
spilled
the
beans
on
her,
or
she
became,
at
a
party
one
night
she
let
it
slip
what
she
had
done,
then
nobody,
i
think,
would
seriously
argue
that
we
could
not
have
acted
at
that
time.
what
the
government
and
the
plaintiff
argued
is
that
because
this
came
out
in
discovery,
which
was
a
result
of
her
exercising
her
right
to
bring
a
civil
action,
that
we
are
precluded
from
relying
on
it
at
that
time.
if
you
accept
that,
the
plaintiff
is
better
off
than
they
would
have
been
otherwise
solely
because
they
filed
a
discrimination
claim,
and
that
is
not
what
the
law
of
this
court
says
is
the
law
of
the
land.
so
in
that
answer
it
would
be,
once
the
employer
finds
out
about
it,
damages
stops,
the
end.
we
would
note
that
the
eeoc
has
taken
the
position
that
initially
that
there
were
no
damages,
that
the
only
thing
the
court
could...
would
award
would
be
declaratory
relief
and
backpay.
then
they
went
to
the
position
of
saying
it
stopped
when
the
employer
found
out
about
it,
and
now
if
i
understand
what
they're
saying,
it
goes
on
ad
inf...
until
there's
a
judgment,
unless
we
could
prove
metaphysically
somehow
that
we
would
have
found
out
about
it
otherwise,
and
i
think
here
we
concede
that
there's
no
way
we
would
have
known
about
this
misconduct.
she
was
too
good
at
what
she
did.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
if
the
employer
could
prove,
your
honor,
that
it
would
have
terminated
her
absent
the
illegal
intent,
if
it
would
have
taken
the
same
action
based
upon
the
stealing
of
the
confidential
documents,
then
the
answer
is
yes,
she
would
not
have
a
claim
for
relief
under
the
discrimination
laws,
and
that
is
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
price
waterhouse,
that's
the
teaching
of
the
principle
in
mount
healthy,
and
that's
what
this
court
has
recognized
over
and
over
again.
turning
to
the
relief
aspect,
your
honor--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--well,
your
honor,
i
suspect
because
in
those
cases
there
were
disputes
of
fact
that
required
a
trial.
in
your
hypothetical,
the
existence
of
that
smoking
gun
memo
may
well
be
sufficient
to
create
a
question
of
fact
that
would
then
go
to
the
jury
as
to,
would
the
company
have
in
fact
put
aside
the
discriminatory
motive
and
done
the
same
thing
anyway?
in
that
circumstance,
then
certainly
a
trial
may
be
appropriate.
we're
not
suggesting
that
summary
judgment
is
always
appropriate
in
these
cases,
but
where
there
are
no
disputed
facts,
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
submit
that
we
should
be
entitled
to
a
valid
defense
because
of
the
employee's
misconduct.
the
employee
has
no
one
to
blame
but
themselves.
any
denial
of
a
remedy
or
relief
is
a
result
of
their
own
misconduct.
we
submit
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
discrimination
laws
should
be
used
to
benefit
employees
who
were
bad
apples.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
yes,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
what
the
court
could
do.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
did
not
hear
the
second--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--the
court
certainly
could
do
that
in
handling
the
case,
your
honor.
we
submit,
and
i
think
we
put
forth
in
our
brief
and
one
of
our
amicus
submits,
this
is
in
the
form
of
an
affirmative
defense
of
the
employer.
the
employer
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
there
was
misconduct
that
objectively
would
have
resulted
in
termination,
and
subjectively
it
would
have
resulted
in
termination.
if
they
can
establish
that
either
through
undisputed
facts
on
summary
judgment
or
in
a
trial,
then
that
provides
a
defense.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
well,
your
honor,
it's
relevant
but
it's
not
determinative.
it's
the
same
thing
as
in--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
better
practice
probably
would
be
to
have
a
trial
on
the
merits
with
this
being
an
affirmative
defense,
but
it's
similar
to
going
to
the
qualification
requirement
of
a
plaintiff.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
that's
correct,
your
honor.
just--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--no,
your
honor.
if
i
understood
justice
souter's
question,
it
went
to
if
there
was
a
question
of
intent
of
violation,
wouldn't
that
be
wrapped
up
in
this
whole
question
of
what
you
would
have
done,
and
i'm
saying
that
i
think
the
better
aspect
would
be
if
the
company
cannot
prove
on
the
basis
of
undisputed
facts
and
summary
judgment,
then
the
entire
case
goes
to
trial,
rather
than
bifurcating
the
trial
just
for
this
issue
and
then
holding
the
liability
issue
later.
but
if
this
is
proven,
if
it's
proven
that
the
after-acquired
evidence
would
have
resulted
in
the
person's
termination,
was
sufficient
for
that,
then
that
is
a
valid
defense.
you
have
to...
again,
i
think
what
the
courts
have
said
that
have
adopted
this
bar
to
relief,
as
you
look
at
the
remedy,
you
look
at
the
claim
of
injury,
and
then
you
look
at
the
relief
that
they're
requesting.
the
claim
of
injury
in
a
wrongful
discharge
case
is
that
they
were
terminated,
and
they've
lost
wages
and
benefits.
that's
the
relief
that's
available,
and
the
misconduct
serves
to
cut
the
legs
out
from
under
that
claim,
because
it
is
also
a
result,
or
results
in
that
injury,
and
the
plaintiff
has
no
one
to
blame
for
theirselves.
on-the-job
misconduct,
whether
it
was
fact
at
the
time,
whether
the
employer
knew
it
at
the
time
or
not,
is
relevant,
and
it's
properly
considered
by
this
court.
we
submit
that
if
you
ignore
this
evidence
it
would
be
impractical.
this
is
not
something
where
there
is
a
blanket
bar.
you
look
at
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case,
and
the
court--
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
--that
it
did
not,
your
honor?
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
i
don't
think
it
would
be
any
provable
damages
to
the
employer,
your
honor.
it's
not
like
she
stole
money.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
i
think
there
was
certainly
an
injury
and
a
damage
to
the
employer,
but
i
don't
know
that's
something
they
could
recover
for.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
well,
she
breached
her
confidence
and
trust,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
she
stole
documents
from
the
company.
mr.
r.
eddie
wayland
thank
you,
your
honor.
