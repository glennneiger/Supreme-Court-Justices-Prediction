mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
evidence
of
an
employee's
misconduct
that
is
acquired
after
the
employer
has
discharged
that
employee
on
the
basis
of
age
has
no
bearing
on
the
question
of
liability
under
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act.
evidence
or
proof
that
the
misconduct
would
have
caused
the
employer
to
discharge
that
employee
had
he
known
about
it
can
affect
the
scope
of
relief,
but
the
sixth
circuit's
holding
that
such
proof
precludes
all
relief
under
all
circumstances
is
incompatible
with
the
language
and
purposes
of
the
adea.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
we
believe
that
the
appropriate
cutoff
date
is
the
date
upon
which
the
employer
would
have
discovered
the
information
had
there
been
no
discrimination
and
no
lawsuit.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
eeoc
position
on
this
issue
has
evolved,
and
at
one
point
it
was
using
or
advising
its
investigators...
there's
never
been
an
eeoc
regulation
on
this.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
right
now,
the
position
is
the
one
reflected
in
our
brief,
which
is
that
the
cutoff
date
should
go
to
the
date
on
which
the
employer
would
have
discovered
the
information
had
there
been
no
discrimination.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
what
commends
it
is
that
it
advances
the
purposes
of
the
statute
here,
which--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--yes,
but
i
think
what
it--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--and
in
cases
like
that,
then
the
backpay
period
should
go
to
the
date
of
judgment.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
would
just--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
remedy
issue
as
to
what
particular
remedies
ought
to
be
granted--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
think
that
it
fairly
raises
whether,
assuming
there--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
what
i
would
say
is
that
it
raises
the
question
of
whether
all
relief
can
be
precluded,
even
assuming
there's
liability.
it
arises
the
question
of
whether
there's
liability
at
all,
and
the
question
of,
assuming
there's
liability,
can
you
preclude
all
relief.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
you
do
not.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
all
you
have
to
decide
in
this
case,
this--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i
think
that
that's
probably
so.
on
the
issue
of
liability,
i
wanted
to
make
two
basic
points.
first,
with
a
few
exceptions
that
are
not
applicable
here,
the
language
of
the
statute
broadly
prohibits
employment
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age
against
any
individual.
there
is
no
exception
in
the
statute
that
would
license
an
employer
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
age
against
an
employee
who
is
engaged
in
this
conduct.
second,
as
this
court's
decisions
have
made
clear,
the
critical
question
in
determining
the
issue
of
liability
under
the
statute,
is
what
actually
motivated
the
employer
at
the
time
of
the
adverse
action,
and
that
point
is
crucial
here.
since
this
case
arises
on
summary
judgment,
it
must
be
assumed
that
at
the
time
the
respondent
discharged
petitioner,
it
acted
entirely
on
the
basis
of
her
age.
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
that
was
sufficient
to
establish
a
violation.
after-acquired
evidence
of
petitioner's
misconduct
could
not
change
the
historical
fact
that
by
then
there
had
already
been
a
violation
of
the
act,
so
the
only
remaining
question
is
what
the
appropriate
remedy
is
for
that
violation,
and
that's
governed
by
29
u.s.c.
section
626,
which
authorizes
district
courts
to
grant
such
legal
and
equitable
relief
as
may
be
appropriate
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
unless
the
employer
can
show--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--then--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
think
that
it
is
equitable
because
you
look
at
what
is
equitable
in
light
of
advancing
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
which
are
deterrence,
and
making
whole
the
victims
of
discrimination.
running
the
backpay
to
the
date
of
judgment
provides
further
deterrence
and
it
slots
the
employee
more
nearly
in
the
position
that
that
employee
would
have
occupied
had
there
been
no
discrimination.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
absolutely,
that
there
would...
in
that
case,
it
would
look
like
a
clear
claim
for
offset
that
would
probably
offset
all
the
backpay.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
theft.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
only
in
the
sense
that
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
justice
scalia,
we--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
does,
but
that's--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
it
does--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
it
says
such
legal
or
equitable
relief
as
may
be
appropriate
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act.
that's
exactly
what
it
says.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
our
answer
to
that
is,
and
i
think
this
is
the
question
is
which
of
those
two
rules
best
advances
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
and
we
think
that
the
rule
that
you...
the
backpay
ends
on
the
date
on
which
the
employer
would
have
discovered
it
follows
directly
from
this
court's
decision
in
albemarle.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
right.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
don't
think
there
should
be
an...
that
implies
a
sort
of
unguided
discretion
to
deny
relief
based
on
your
reaction
to
the
personal
character
of
the
plaintiff.
you
still
have
to
decide
whether
it's
appropriate
in
light
of
the
purposes
of
this
statute.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
that
the
virtue
of
the
date
of
discovery
rule
is
that
it's
easier
to
administer,
but
i
think
that
that
should
be
balanced
against...
the
more
important
question
is
which
rule
is
more
appropriate
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
not
which
rule
is
easier
to
administer.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
i
would
not...
you
can
call
a
thief
a
thief,
sure.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
i
would
say
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i
think
it's
unguided
when
the
rule
is,
if
somebody
who's
engaged
in
serious
misconduct,
they
get
relief,
somebody
who's
engaged
in
less
serious
misconduct,
they
do
not
get
the
relief.
that's
the
rule
that's
proposed
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
that,
it
seems
to
us,
leads
to
unguided
discretion,
which
this
court
has
had
experience
with
in
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
there
will
be
discretion,
but
not
on
the
basis
of
the
employer's
misconduct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
don't
think--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
don't
think
it's
an
appropriate
line
to
draw,
because
there
are
many
things
that
are
not
criminal
that
are
very
serious,
and
there
are
many
things
that
are
criminal--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
larceny
will
not
go
unpunished,
because
that
violates
the
criminal
law
and
the
state
will
punish
it.
at
the
same
time,
the
employer
will
have
a
right
to
recover
whatever
the
value
of
the
larceny
is,
but
that
should
not
take
away
from
the
point
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--thank
you.
