--against
whom?
who
would
you
sue
here?
if
you
sue
the
state,
you
can't
sue
the
state
under
1983,
can
you?
justice

who
are
you
suing
here?
who
are
you
suing
here
in
this
case,
the
official?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
sue
the
official
in
his
official
capacity
under
1983?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
we
said
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
have
we
said--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
have
we
said
that
you
may
sue
him
under
1983
for
an
injunction?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
an
old
eleventh
amendment
rule,
yes.
i
have
no
doubt
under
the
eleventh
amendment
injunctive
actions
against
officials
in
their
official
capacity
are
not
deemed
to
be
against
the
state,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
section
1983,
the
word
1983
has
to
be
read
the
same
way,
does
it?

in
will
is
the
only
authority
you
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
allen,
i'm
still
struggling
with
some
doubt
as
to
whether
you
should
be
able
to
bring
a
1983
action
against
an
officer
for
injunction
anyway.
i've
gone
back
and
checked
on
will,
and
it's
the
clearest
dictum
in
will.
we
have
no
holding
on
point
on
whether
you
can
bring
a
1983
action
against
a
state
officer
in
his
official
capacity
for
injunctive
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
more
than
indicates.
it
says
it
flat
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
dictum
in
the
case,
and
the
only
reason
it
says
it
is
because
that's
what
we've
held
with
respect
to
eleventh
amendment
law,
but
this
is
a
statute,
it's
not
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
it's
certainly
open
to
us
to
interpret
the
statute
simply
not
to
allow
a
1983
suit
against
an
officer
acting
in
his
official
capacity.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you.
what
harm
would
be
done?
what
catastrophes
would
befall?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
would
not
be
available
otherwise
than
under
1983?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
certainly
held
otherwise
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
personally,
certainly
you
could,
but
you're
seeking
an
injunction
against
him
in
his
official
capacity.
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
was
the
holding
of
will.
but
not
under--
