chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-688,
the
national
private
truck
council,
inc.,
v.
the
oklahoma
tax
commission.
mr.
allen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a
state
had
a
requirement
just
like
the
federal
government
does
now
that
there
simply
shall
not
be
injunctions
issued
enjoining
the
collection
of
a
tax.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
federal
remedy
requires
the
states
to
do
something
that
congress
has
said
the
federal
government
can't
be
required
to
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
you
would
have
no
standing
in
that
case.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
gray
hair.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
place
where
it
makes
a
difference
i
think
is
between...
is
what
has
to
happen
between
the
time
you
first
challenge
the
tax
and
the
time
there's
an
ultimate
adjudication.
are
you
entitled
to
at
least
ask
for
and
perhaps
get
a
preliminary
injunction,
or
can
the
state
say,
we
just
don't
issue
injunctions
in
this
kind
of
case,
you've
got
to
pay
first,
and
then
we'll
adjudicate
your
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
they
impose
a
special
rule
on
anybody
who
seeks
to
enjoin
the
collection
of
a
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
nobody
knows
when
you
start
out
whether
it's
a
federally
unconstitutional
tax
or
not.
that's
something
that's...
you're
ultimately
entitled
to
a
determination
of
somewhere
in
the
state
court
system,
but
what
is
the
interim
status
quo?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
allen.
mr.
johnston,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
here
the
taxpayer
did
comply
with
oklahoma
procedures,
or
at
least
in
that
respect.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
johnston.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
94-688,
national
private
truck
council
v.
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
