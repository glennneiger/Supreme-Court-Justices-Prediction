justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
what
sense
does
that
make
in
terms
of
the
tax
injunction
act?
you
said
the
concern
is
you
don't
want
the
federal
courts
to
be
telling
the
states.
isn't
it
so
much
worse
to
be
telling
the
states,
but
you've
got
to
do
it.
you've
got
to
be
the
one
to
say
you
can't
have
your
own
constitutional--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
he
doesn't
need
it,
because
the
court
said
the
tax
is
unconstitutional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
could
he...
how
could--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
allen,
you
just
said
the
state
court
has
said
this
tax
is
unconstitutional,
and
once
the
state
court
said
that,
how
can
any
state
tax
collector
go
out
and
levy
on
the
property?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
once
the
state--
--but
just
for
the
reasonable
attorney's
fees
for
the
future
injunction,
because
you
have
your
other
relief
under
the
other
cause
of
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
back
up
and
explain
to
me
how
you
would
ever
get
injunctive
relief
once
you've
had
complete
adequate
remedy
at
law.
you've
gotten
the
refund
back
with
whatever
interest
is
due.
what
injunction
would
you
then
get?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
talking
about
the
judgment
of
a
state
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
a
case
like
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
it
makes
the
injunction,
it
would
make
it
under
what
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that...
i
didn't
realize
that
was
the
case.
i
assumed
that
the
state
would
assume
the
good
faith
of
its
tax
commission
and
would
just
say
refund
and
not
say,
and
we
enjoin
the
tax
commission.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wasn't--
--it
authorized--
--the
whole
purpose
of
that
legislation
to
give
you
a
cause
of
action
in
federal
court,
because
the
state
courts,
the
concern
was
at
that
time,
would
not
enforce
your
federal
rights?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
wasn't
the
history
of
1983.
wasn't
the
very
reason
it
was
created
was
that
the
state
courts
were
not
trusted
to
handle
these
civil
rights
cases,
and
so
a
federal
remedy
was
created?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
johnston,
if
you're
right,
then
wasn't
the
end
of
the
road
in
the
dennis
case
wrong?
that
is,
there
was...
when
that
case
was
remanded
there
was
an
award
of
counsel
fees
under
1988,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
consider...
let's
assume
you're
right
about
that,
that
it
wasn't
even
considered.
if
one
considers
it,
how
must
one
rule,
and
accepting
your
argument,
can,
in
that
dennis
case
there
be,
at
the
end
of
the
line,
counsel
fees
under
1988?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
a
state
is
not
a
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
seems
to
undermine,
at
least
in
part,
the
dennis
case,
because
isn't...
if
you're
right
about
the
bottom
line
in
dennis
being
no
counsel
fees,
wasn't
that
kind
of
a
pyrrhic
victory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
case
itself
happened
to
be
a
tax
case.
