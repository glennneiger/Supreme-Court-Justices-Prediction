mr.
richard
a.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
state
courts
may
refuse
to
enforce
remedies
under
two
federal
statutes,
sections
1983
and
1988
of
title
42,
in
cases
challenging
state
taxes
when
state
courts
and
state
procedures
provide
an
adequate
remedy
for
the
underlying
claim.
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
in
this
case
held
that
state
courts
may
refuse
to
enforce
remedies
under
sections
1983
and
1988
in
such
cases.
it
based
that
conclusion
entirely
on
what
it
termed
principles
of
comity
in
federalism,
which
it
perceived
to
be
embodied
in
the
federal
tax
injunction
act,
which
prohibits
federal
courts
from
enjoining
state
taxes
in
cases
where
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
may
be
had
in
the
courts
of
such
state.
the
main
consequence
of
that
ruling
in
this
case
is
to
deny
petitioners
a
right
to
recover
their
attorney's
fees
that
they
would
otherwise
have
under
section
1988.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
justice
o'connor,
there
may
be...
there
may
well
be
other
consequences
to
the
conclusion
that
section
1983
applies.
none
of
those
questions
are
presented
in
this
case
or
really
properly--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--if
a
state
has
a
procedure
requiring
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
in
a
tax
case,
which,
by
the
way,
oklahoma
does
not,
but
if
it
did,
this
court's
previous
decisions
would
indicate
that
in
the
1983
action
those
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy
requirements
are...
ordinarily
cannot
be
enforced
in
the
federal
procedure.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
not
necessarily,
justice
o'connor.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why,
in
a
section
1983
action...
i
don't
see
why
it
would
be
implied
in
a
1983
action
that
you
necessarily
had
a
predeprivation
remedy.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
let
me
simply
repeat
that
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
probable
outcome,
if
that
was...
if
the
issue
was
squarely
presented,
the
logic
would
probably
be
that
a
person
who
filed
a
1983
action
challenging
a
state
tax
in
state
court
before
he
paid
the
tax,
and
if
the
state
court
made
a
final
adjudication
that
the
state
tax
was
unconstitutional,
i
do
believe
that
section
1983
would
entitle
the
taxpayer
in
that
circumstance
to
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief
which
would
in
effect
preclude
the
state
from--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--well--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--well,
you
raise
a
very
pertinent
question,
but
i
think
we
have
to
be
very
careful
here,
because
the
point
you
just
made
was
that
the
court
has
been
careful
to
preserve
the
right
of
states
to...
or
at
least
the
constitutional
right
of
states,
putting
apart
the
requirements
of
any
federal
statute,
the
constitutional
rights
of
states
to
require
people
to
pay
their
taxes
before
they
litigate
the
ultimate
question.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
my
view,
under
section
1983,
if
you
filed
an
action
and
there
was
a
litigation
that
finally
determined
that
the
tax
was
unconstitutional...
in
other
words,
you
had
done
your
litigation,
then
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--well,
there's--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--there's
a
very
important
distinction,
i
think,
for
these
purposes,
between
a
preliminary
injunction
and
a
permanent
injunction.
the
point
i
was
making
earlier
was
that
when
you
have
filed
your
action
and
it's
come
to
a
final
judgment
in
the
trial
court,
and
the
final
judgment
is
that
the
state
is...
that
the
tax
is
unconstitutional,
i
believe
that
under
1983
you
would
be
entitled
to
a
permanent
injunction
against
the
collection
of
the
tax.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
think
in
those
cases,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
state
scheme
has
to
yield
to
the
federal
remedy,
and
i
think--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
let
me
return
to--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--well,
i
think
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
i
think
that
the
federal
scheme
under
section
1983
gives
taxpayers,
state
taxpayers
a
right
to
equitable
relief
when
a
state
tax
is
unconstitutional.
a
good
example
would
be,
in
my
view,
a
poll
tax,
which
this
court
has
held
to
be...
to
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
if
a
state
had
a
poll
tax
that
required
poor
people
to
pay
$20
before
they
could
vote,
if
a
state
also
had
a
statute
that
said,
but
you've
got
to
pay
your
tax
before
you
can
litigate
the
validity
of
it,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
taxpayer
in
that
situation
would
have
a
right,
under
section
1983,
to
an
injunction
enjoining
the
enforcement
of
that
poll
tax,
because--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--no.
in
my
example
against
the
official--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--the
official.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes,
you
can,
justice
scalia.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes,
you
have.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
for
an
injunction--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--for
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
exactly
right.
so
in
my
example
of
the
poll
tax,
you
would
sue
the
election
official
who
was
seeking
to
make
the
individual
pay
the
tax,
and
you
would
get
an
injunction
prohibiting
him
from
enforcing
that
poll
tax.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
seems
to
me
the
logical
and
appropriate
result.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
in
the
will
v.
michigan
state
police,
footnote
10,
is
where
you
have
distinguished...
you
reaffirmed
the
well-established
distinction--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--well,
will
was
a
section
1983
case,
and
in
that
case,
in
footnote
10--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--footnote
10
in
will
i
think
clearly
established
that
under
section
1983...
and
really
reaffirmed
the
distinction
between
prospective
and
damage
relief,
that
under
section
1983
one
may
obtain
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
against
state
official--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--that's
true.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
if--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
not
under
section
1983.
to
return
to
my
poll
tax
example,
i
don't
think
in
that
example
the
state
court
could
say,
the
man
can
sue
and
get
a
refund
of
his
poll
tax
after
he
litigates
the
validity
of--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--well,
i
don't
know
why
one
would
not.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
really
don't...
that
may
be
true,
but
i
really
don't
see
the
distinction
between
that
and
any
other
constitutional
tax.
you
can't
operate
your
trucks
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
without
paying
this
tax.
you've
got
to
pay
the
tax
and
litigate
later.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
the
right
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
you
might
decide...
if
you're
mr.
griffiths
here,
you
might
decide
instead
of
operating
in
oklahoma,
i'm
going
to
operate
in
arkansas,
where
i
don't
have
to
pay
this
tax.
it's
a
burden.
it's
a
very
significant
burden.
but--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--well,
the
question
was,
i
believe
the
question
was
it
is
open
to
a
state
court
who
has
determined
that
a
tax
is
unconstitutional,
is
it
open
to
that
state
court
to
say,
you've
still
got
to
pay
it
and
then
go
for
your
refund
later,
and
i
submit
that
under
the
scheme
of
section
1983
that's
simply
not
open
to
the
state
court.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
that's
why--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--that's
why
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
and
draw
a
careful
distinction
between
a
request
for
preliminary
injunctive
relief
and
a
request
for
final
injunctive
relief.
now,
if
we're
talking
about
a
request
for
preliminary
injunctive
relief,
then
i
submit
that
whether
you're
filing
under
section
1983
or
any
other
statute,
the
courts
can
and
properly
do
impose
upon
the
claimant
a
very
high
showing.
he
has
to
show
irreparable
injury,
he
has
to
show
a
strong
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits,
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
and
i
have
no
dispute
with
the
proposition
that
when
you're
requesting
preliminary
relief
before
there's
been
an
adjudication
of
the
merits
the
courts
can
properly
deny
it
if
you
haven't
met
those
high
standards,
and
in
fact
in
this
very
case,
we
sought
preliminary
injunctive
relief,
and
the
trial
judge--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--well,
you're
not
entitled
to...
you
may
not
be
entitled
to
preliminary
relief,
and
i
wouldn't
dispute
that.
as
i
was
about
to
say,
in
this
case
the
trial
judge
denied
our
request
for
preliminary
relief
even
though
he
said
you're
probably
going
to
win
on
the
merits,
and
we
didn't
dispute
that.
but
the
proposition
that
we're
facing
is,
what...
putting
aside
the
question
for
preliminary
relief,
there's
been
a
full
adjudication
and
the
trial
judge
says,
hey,
i'm
persuaded
that
this
tax
is
unconstitutional,
and
that--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--no.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
my
answer
is
no.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
would
not
have
to
provide
a
preliminary
injunctive...
injunction.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
agree
with
part
of
that
question,
but
let
me
try
to
explain
my
answer.
i
agree
that
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
preliminary
injunctive
relief,
but
if
we're
at
the
stage
where
there's
been
a
full
adjudication
and
the
court
has
decided
this
tax
is
unconstitutional,
obviously
unconstitutional,
as
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
said
here,
then
i
submit
that
the
petitioner
would
be
entitled
to
injunctive
relief--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--he
may
not
need
it,
and
therefore
we're
really
arguing
about
something
that
has
no
significant
impact
on
the
states,
but
i
submit
to
you
that
if
the
tax
collector
nevertheless
threatened
a
levy
on
his
property,
that
he
would
be
entitled
under--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--section
1983
to
injunctive
relief.
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
most
of
them
won't,
but
sometimes
they
will.
the
point
is
that
injunctive
relief
is,
in
those
situations
where
the
tax
collector
would
threaten
to
levy
on
the
property,
injunctive
relief
is
not
only
appropriate--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--but
i
submit
required
by
section
198--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--i--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--well,
i
have
to
only
respectfully
submit
that
in
some
circumstances
i
don't
think
it
would
be.
let's
take
a
case
where
the
state
enacts
a
tax...
what
is
it
now,
april,
and
they're
going
to
impose
a
million-dollar
tax
on
me
next
january
1
that
is...
applies
only
to
black
people,
let's
say,
and
i
go
into
federal
court...
i
go
into
state
court
and
say,
enjoin
that
tax,
because
it's
clearly
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
putting
aside
the
standing
question...
a
tax
only
on...
i
don't
know--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--gray-haired
white
men,
right.
[laughter]
i
think
i
could
go
into
state
court
and
say,
enjoin
that
tax,
and
i
don't
think
the
state
court
could,
under
our
scheme
of
1983,
say,
sorry,
you've
got
to
pay
the
tax
and
litigate
later.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--yes.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
would
value
attorney's
fees--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--unless
it's
by
the
value
of
the...
i
think
you're
entitled...
if
you're
entitled
to
any
relief
under
section
1983
you're
entitled
to
your
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
don't
know.
that's
a
good...
i
frankly
don't
know.
i
mean,
it--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--well,
in
this
case,
for
example,
and
typically
in
many
of
these
cases,
you
get
a
final
judgment
on
the
merits,
and
the
judgment
reads,
tax
commission
shall
refund,
and
furthermore
we
permanently
enjoin
the
tax
commission
from
enjoining
the
tax.
it's
all
done
at
the
same
time.
the
judgments
in
these
cases
typically
include--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--yes.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
normally
they
don't
specify.
they
just
say,
the
final
judgment
for
the
plaintiffs,
and
here...
it
is
ordered
as
follows,
and
then--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--sometimes
they
do
and
sometimes
they
don't.
in
fact,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
i
think
as
some
of
the
justices
have
pointed
out,
once
there's
been
a
final
determination
of
unconstitutionality,
whether
or
not
a
formal
injunction
is
entered
or
not
is
largely
pro
forma,
and
in
many...
but
in
many
cases
the
courts
do
issue
injunctions,
and
in
some
cases
they
say
we
don't
need
to
issue
an
injunction
here.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
think
they
can
impose
the
normal
requirements
that
are
imposed
on
persons
seeking
preliminary
injunctions.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no,
i
don't
believe
they
can.
i
think
under
section
198...
i
think
under
the
federal
scheme,
if
it's
a
federally
unconstitutional
tax,
then...
and
there's
been
a...
i
don't
think
they
can--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--well,
if
you
seek
a
preliminary
injunction,
the
court
looks
at
whether
there's
irreparable
injury
and
the
degree
of
the
likelihood
of
success
and
all
the
rest
of
those--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--well,
i
think
under
normal,
equitable
principles,
when
you
get
to
the
point
where
there's
been
a
final
determination
of
unconstitutionality,
under--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--under
a
preliminary...
under
a
preliminary
injunction,
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage,
i
don't
think
the...
in
my
view,
i
don't
think
that
states
can
say,
as
a
blanket
matter,
when
you're
challenging
a
state
tax
as
unconstitutional,
as
a
blanket
matter
we're
not
going
to
issue
preliminary
injunctions.
i
think
that
they
can
impose
on
litigants
the
normal
standards
of
preliminary
injunctions,
but
i
don't
think
they
can
erect
a
special
standard
that
would
apply
to
people
challenging
unconstitutional
state
taxes,
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
preliminary
injunctions,
although
you
have
to
meet
a
high
burden,
are
not
unknown
in
this
area.
we've
cited
in
our
reply
brief
an
instance
a
few
years
ago
involving
an
arkansas
truck
tax
where
justice
blackmun
issued,
in
effect,
a
form
of
preliminary
injunctive
relief
when
he
required
the
state
to
put
the
taxes
in
an
escrow
fund.
that
is
a
form
of
preliminary
injunctive
relief.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
when
you
say
no
exhaustion
requirement,
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean.
administrative
exhaustion?
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
think--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--well,
i
think
the
question
of
whether
or
not
states
can
require
you
to
exhaust
some
administrative
remedy
is
a
somewhat
different
question
here
than
the
one
we've
been
addressing,
which
is,
what
can
states
do
when
you
seek
a
preliminary
injunction
in
court,
so
maybe
i'm
not
understanding
your
question
correctly.
i
think
that
also
with
respect
to
state
requirements
that
you
exhaust
some
administration
remedy
that
you
go
through
the
tax
commission
when
you
have
a
claim
of
unconstitutional
taxes,
i
think
that
under
the
scheme
of
section
1983,
those
would
probably
also
not
be
able
to
be
imposed,
but--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--i
don't
think...
no.
i
think
clearly
states
could
not
do
that.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
there
are
lots
of
cases
that
say
that...
howlett
v.
rose,
for
example,
that
says
that
states
cannot
refuse
to
enforce
section
19--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
that
gets
back
to
a
very
basic
question
of
what
the
obligations
of
state
courts
are,
and
we
submit
that--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--well,
1983
is
what
congress
has
applied
not
only
for
federal
courts
but
also
for
state
courts,
and
it's
well-established
that--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--no,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
well
settled
that
1983
is
enforceable
in
state
courts
as
well
as
federal
courts.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
the
court
has
nevertheless
held
that
state
courts
are--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--that
it's
as
much
law
in
the
states
as
it
is
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no,
but
you
have
held
in
many,
many
cases
that
federal...
that
state
courts
have
an
obligation,
a
fundamental
obligation
to
enforce
an
implied
federal
law,
that...
you
said
in
howlett
v.
rose
for
example--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--federal
substantive
law,
but
section
1988
is
certainly
federal
substantive
law.
it
entitles--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--yes,
it's
part
of
the
federal...
it's
an
important
part,
i
might
add,
but
it's
also...
it
is
also
substantive
law.
it
imposes
an
obligation
on
states
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
certainly
will
indicates
that
that's
the
case,
and
i
think
will--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--yes.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
that
would
undo...
it
seems
to
me
that
would
undo
an
awful
lot
of
section
1983
jurisprudence.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
there
are
lots
of
instances
outside
the
tax
area
where
injunctive
relief
against
a
state
officer
acting
in
violation
of
the
constitution
is
essential.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
available
otherwise,
but
in--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--but
in
cases...
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
would
or
would
not
be
available,
but
let's
take
a
case
where
a
state
official
is
enforcing
some
blatantly
racially
discriminatory
policy,
and
you
want
him
to
stop.
it
seems
to
me
under
section
1983
you
can
get
an
injunction,
and
under
section
1988
you're
entitled
to--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--yes,
even
if
he
was
acting
in
good
faith
and
believed
with
some
reason
that
what
he
was
doing
was
constitutional,
i
think
you
can
get
an
injunction
against
him
under
section
1988,
and
i
think
you
can
get
attorney's
fees
under
section
1988.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--we
did
name
the
officers
in
the
complaint
and
in
the...
in
the
style
of
the
complaint--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--and
in
the...
and
in
the
body
of
the
complaint
we
named
them
all.
just
to
finish
answering
your
question,
i
notice
that
we
did
not
in
that
particular
prayer
for
relief
in
that
paragraph
specify
the
officers,
but
certainly
throughout
this
case,
and
as
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
held,
we
have
made
clear
that
we
were
suing
the
individuals
here
in
their
official
capacity
for
injunctive
relief.
