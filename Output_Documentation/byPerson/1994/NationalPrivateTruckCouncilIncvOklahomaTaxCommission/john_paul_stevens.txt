justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
because
that's
obviously
not
a
plain,
adequate
remedy
if
you
can't
vote
without
paying
the
tax.
i
mean,
that
wouldn't
satisfy
the
tax
injunction
act
requirement,
would
it,
to
sue
afterward?
you
have
to
come
up
with
the
money
first
and
then
that's
what
prevents
people
from
voting?
i
mean,
nobody's
ever
suggested
the
tax
injunction
act
would
prevent
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
payment
of
a
poll
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it's
not...
the
state
doesn't
provide
an
adequate
remedy
when
it
says
you
can't
vote,
which
is
what
would
be
the
effect
of
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
those,
there's
nothing
at
stake
except
the
interest
in
not
having
to
pay
the
amount
of
money.
nothing
like
the
right
to
vote
is
implicated
in
any
of
these
other
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
you
don't...
you
can't
afford
to
engage
and
pay
the
tax
on
the
assumption--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
more
basic
question
for
a
moment?
do
you
think
a
state
could
say,
we
have
state
procedures
that
vindicate
both
state
and
federal
constitutional
rights,
and
they
include
exhaustion
and
lots
of
other
things.
we
are
simply
not
going
to
entertain
any
1983
actions.
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
statute
that
requires
that
remedy
to
be
enforced
in
any
court
except
a
federal
court.
could
a
state--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why?
what's
your
authority
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
cannot
interpose
a
sovereign
immunity
defense
in
a
federal
case
if
they
were
not
imposed
in
the
state
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
hold
they
must
entertain
1983
cases
ab
initio.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
may
be
an
obligation
to
enforce
the
substantive
federal
constitutional
right,
but
that's
quite
different
from
saying
they
must
enforce
the
procedural
remedy
that
congress
has
provided
for
federal
courts
in
1983.
justice
john
paul
stevens
state
courts
are--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
may
entertain
1983
cases.
we've
never
held
they
must.
justice
john
paul
stevens
federal
substantive
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
part
of
the
1983
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about,
sort
of
the
way
the
case
developed?
the
complaint,
as
i
read
it,
doesn't
say
what
provisions
they're
relying
on
until
they
get
to
count
3
and
they
say
they're
relying
on
1983.
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
said,
we
allowed
a
refund
to
plaintiff
based
upon
the
refund
procedures
in
68
o.s.
1981
section
226.1,
and
so
forth.
i
don't
understand
that
the
plaintiffs
relied
on
those
refund
procedures
in
their
pleadings.
did
they,
or
am
i
mistaken?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
you're
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
in
effect
saying
that
they
pleaded
in
the
alternative
a
state
remedy
and
a
federal
remedy,
and
it
was
within
the
power
of
the
state
court
to
say
we'll
grant
the
state
relief
and
we
just
won't
grant
the
other
relief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
their...
their
count
3,
when
they...
i
mean,
you're
right
about
the
jurisdictional
provision,
but
when
they
get
around
to
asking
for
relief
they
seem
to
rely...
i
thought
they
had
relied,
and
i
misread
it,
i
see,
on
the
federal
statute
only.
but
supposing
they
had
just
pleaded
the
federal
statute,
say
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction...
we're
not
going
to
ask
you
to
apply
your
refund
procedures,
but
we're
going
to
ask
you
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
for
precisely
the
same
relief
that
we
could
get
under
state
law,
but
we
want
it
under
the
federal
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
just
never
cited
the
refund
procedures.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
i'm
saying
they
say
the
relief
we
want
is,
we're
going
to
pay
the
taxes
now,
so
you
won't
have
the
normal...
we
think
that's
a
fair
requirement.
we're
going
to...
and
we're
going
to
pay
the
taxes.
we
merely
want
a
refund,
and
after
we
get
a
refund,
an
injunction
against
future
imposition
of
taxes,
which
we
think
we're
entitled
to
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
and
it
doesn't
interfere
with
any
state
policy
except
your
unwillingness
to
pay
attorney's
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we're
doing
it
in
state
court.
we're
doing
it
in
state
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
eleventh
amendment
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
not?
the
language
of
1983
is
pretty
broad
about
any,
you
know...
i
can't
quote
it
to
you,
but
it's
pretty
broad,
and
if
there's
been
a
collection
of
taxes
in
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
why...
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
asking
us
to
reject
the
footnote
that
justice
scalia
was
addressing
himself
to
a
little
earlier.
is
that
part
of
your
case?
no,
only
for
damages,
you're
saying.
the
footnote--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--went
to
injunctive
relief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but...
but
so
what?
i
mean,
why
isn't
it
an
action--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
under...
but
that
was
an
eleventh
amendment
case,
wasn't
it?
