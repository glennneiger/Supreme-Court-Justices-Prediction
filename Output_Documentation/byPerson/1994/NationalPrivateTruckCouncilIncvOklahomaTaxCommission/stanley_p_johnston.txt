mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
a
very
important
question
that
is
before
the
court
that
has
to
be
answered
is,
did
congress
intend
to
impose
on
state
courts
the
obligation
to
apply
federal
remedies
under
1983
or
1988
or
otherwise
in
state
tax
challenges
when
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
is
available
and
may
be
had
under
state
law?
i
submit
that
congress
had
no
such
intention
and
did
not
accomplish
that
with
1983.
the
nature
of
this
case
is
more
than
just
an
injunction.
the
lawsuit
was
brought
under
the
state
statute
that
provided
that
anyone
who
wishes
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
a
tax
statute
or
the...
or
its
violation
under
a
federal
statute
must
give
notice
after
it
has
been
assessed
or
proposed
to
be
assessed,
must
give
notice,
pay
the
tax
under
protest,
and
then
may
file
a
lawsuit
in
district
court,
the
state's
trial
court,
for
its
recovery.
now,
the
statute,
of
course,
does
not
provide
for
injunction.
oklahoma
does
not,
as
do
some
states,
have
any
specific
statute
prohibiting
enjoining
a
state
tax,
although
oklahoma
case
law
has
on
several
occasions
prohibited
it.
declaratory
relief
has
been
allowed
under
oklahoma
case
law
against
a
tax
if
the
tax
is
not
yet
due.
once
the
tax
is
due
and
proposed
to
be
assessed,
however,
the
oklahoma
statutes
provide
basically
two
remedies.
one
is
the
administrative
hearing
remedy,
which
also
can
be
used
at
the
taxpayer's
option
to
challenge
a
proposed
assessment
on
any
grounds,
including
grounds
of
constitu...
state
or
constitutional
questions
or
violation
of
federal
law.
in
addition
to
that
remedy...
by
the
way,
in
the
administrative
hearing
procedure
the
hearing
was
held
before
the
tax
commission
as
an
agency,
and
its
order
is
directly
the
appealable
to
the
oklahoma
supreme
court.
as
an
alternative,
and
this
is
what
was
used
in
this
case,
oklahoma
law
provides
that
instead
of
filing
an
administrative
protest,
that
the
taxpayer
can
pay
the
taxes
under
protest,
file
suit
in
district
court
for
the
recovery.
that
is
what
has
happened
in
this
case.
however--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--that
is
true,
and
for
the
access
to
the
courts
under
this,
and
this
is
title
68,
section
226
of
the
oklahoma
statutes,
under
the
action
226
which
this
was
brought,
there
is
no
need,
other
than
giving
notice
of
intent
and
paying
the
taxes
under
protest
within
30
days,
that
is
the
only
exhaustion
requirement
that
is
necessary,
that
the
oklahoma
courts
have
declared
necessary.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
yes,
they
did.
yes,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--the
decision
below,
and
it
is
our
position
in
support
of
that
decision,
that
where
there
is
a
plain,
adequate
remedy
available
under
state
law,
and
we
submit
that
there
is
such
a
remedy
under
section
226,
that
although
this
court
has
obviously
said
that
state
courts
may
entertain
1983
actions,
we
believe
it
is
consistent
with
congress'
policy
that
the
state
courts
need
not
exercise
the
jurisdiction,
or
to
entertain
a
1983
action
to
accomplish
the
exact
same
thing
that
they
can
accomplish
under
state
law
where
in
fact
they
can
accomplish
more.
for
instance,
the
state
law
under
which
this
case
arose
provides
for
refunds.
they
could
not
get
refunds
under
1983--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--even
if
we--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--that
is
correct.
that's
the
only
thing
that
they
can't
get
under
state
law
that
they
might
get
under
1983
and
its
attendant
section,
1988,
because
state
law
does
not
provide
for
attorney's
fees.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i
certainly
can't...
as
i...
i
will
accept
that
because
my
expertise,
if
any
there
is
with
1983,
certainly
doesn't
go
much
beyond
the
tax
area,
but
i
accept
that
as
a
basic
statement,
but
i
believe
that
the
difference
is,
and
why
not
in
this
case,
is
because
when
congress
enacted
1983
and
then
they
were
aware,
for
instance,
that
in
the
tax
area
it
was
common
that
the
only
right
that
anyone
had
to
challenge
a
state
tax
was
in
the
nature
of
an
action
in,
was
to
pay
it
and
sue
to
recover
it.
more
importantly,
when
the
attorney's
fee
provision
was
enacted,
congress
had
already,
in
1937,
i
believe,
had
already
provided
that...
their
restrictions
against
the
federal
courts
from
interfering
in
state
tax
matters.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i
think
that
the...
probably
the
answer
to
that
is,
if
we
take
that
approach,
and
you
say
well,
we
will...
we
could
extend
1983,
it's
application
to
state
tax
matters,
but
we'll
change
our
interpretation
so
that
there's
no...
that
you
can
have
an
exhaustion
remedy.
however,
if
you
do
that,
i
think
that
you're
then
going
back
and
disregarding
what
the
purpose
of
1983
was,
and
whether
or
not
it
was
ever
intended
to
apply
in
such
cases
in
the
first
place.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
if
i
understand
the
concern,
i
don't
think
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
creating
an
exception
here,
but
recognizing
that
it
never
did
apply
in
the
first
place.
because
i
believe
that
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
tax
injunction
act
clearly
expressed
an
attitude
and
a
policy
of
federal
noninterference
and
nonintrusion
in
the
state
tax
area
with
one
requirement,
of
course,
that
there
be
a
plain,
speedy,
and
adequate
remedy
available.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
it
could
well
assume
that,
but
i--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
in
the
times
when
the
tax
injunction
act
was
enacted,
as
i
understand
historically
you
had
usually
the
situation
where
interstate
businesses
or
taxpayers
were
challenging
state
tax
laws,
not
on
the
basis
of
1983,
but
usually
seeking
injunctions
pending
the
litigation
and
often
causing
the
states,
because
of
their
ability
and
the
taxpayer's
ability
to
either
have
to
give
up
the
case
or
to
accept
something
less
than
what
was
owed,
or
else
have
their
entire
collecting
mechanism,
at
least
to
that
extent,
disrupted
during
the
litigation,
and
congress
perceived
that
as
an
evil,
and
i
don't
recall
that
1983
remedies
were
involved
in
that,
but
they,
in
proceeding--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--well,
as
i
understand
the
historical
basis
of
1983,
it
was
perceived
that
either
there
were
no
state
law
remedies,
or
they
may
have
been
on
the
books,
but
they
were
not
being
enforced,
so
that
a
federal
forum
and
a
federal
remedy
were
provided.
of
course,
1983
in
its
application
had
expanded
far
beyond
the
civil
rights
scope.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
because
of
the
way
it's
written
and
the
continuing
situations
that
come
before
the
courts,
but
i
submit
that
it
was
never
intended...
and
although
it
is
very,
very
broadly
worded,
it
is
so
broadly
worded
as
to
cover
probably
situations
that
i
can't
conceive
of
today,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
considering
the
history
and
the
knowledge,
presumed
knowledge
of
congress
when
both
1983,
the
ku
klux
act,
was
passed
and
also
when
the...
years
later
when
1988
was
added
to
it,
i
do
not
believe
congress
ever
supposed
or
intended,
nor
do
i
believe
the
wording
goes
or
requires
this
court
to
apply
those
remedies,
the
federal
remedies
in
state
tax
actions.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i
believe
that
to
be
true,
your
honor.
i
am...
i
will...
if
i
am
incorrect
i
will
apologize,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
this
argument
was
made
or
even
considered,
even
on
remand.
i
think
it
just
was
taken
as--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--if
i
understand
the
question,
i
believe,
if
they
had
considered
the
question
that
is
present
in
this
case--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--that
the
state
would
have
been
justified
in
accepting,
as
the
court
below
did,
yes,
we
are
now
told,
and
we
understand
that
the
commerce
clause
will
provide
a
basis
for
1983
actions.
however,
the
state
law
provides
a
full
remedy,
and
therefore
we
are
justified
under
principles
of
federalism
and
comity,
considering
the
policy
of
congress,
in
not
entertaining
that,
because
i
don't
believe...
this
court's
decision
in
dennis
didn't
consider
it.
if
it
had
been
considered,
i
think
we
would
have
a
different
situation.
it's
a
fact
they
did
award
attorney's
fees,
but
i
think
they
stopped
with
the
court's
decision
in
dennis
and
did
not
consider
the
next
question,
which
is
the
question
that
we
have
here
today.
if
petitioners
are
right,
following
up
on
an
earlier
question,
i
believe
that,
well,
why
shouldn't
we
do
it?
what
harm
would
it
do?
why
don't
we
require
states
to
give
the
federal
remedies?
well,
where
do
you
stop?
do
you
have
to
start
creating
specific
exceptions,
or
grants,
or
so
forth,
because,
for
instance,
although
under
an
action
in...
under
oklahoma
statute
226,
the
suit
for
recovery,
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedies
are
not
required,
i
believe
other
states
do
have
those
requirements,
that
before
you
can
go
to
court,
you
have
to
have...
follow
certain
administrative
processes.
generally
speaking,
under
1983
those
are
not...
had
not
been
required
by
the
court.
statutes
of
limitations,
for
instance.
generally,
the
statute
of
limitations
under
1983
has
been
held
to
be
the
general
tort
statute
under
the
state.
however,
states
typically
have
much,
much
shorter
statutes
of
limitations
notice
requirements,
notice
of
claim
requirements
for
tax
challenges.
now,
all
of
these
requirements
that
the
states
typically
have,
have
of
course
been
approved
by
the
court,
and
have
been
observed
to
be
constitutional
and
allowable
and
also
very
necessary
to
the
state's
interest
in
protecting,
controlling,
and
administering
the
public
fisc.
if
the
petitioners
are
right,
then
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
a
preliminary
injunction.
if
the
petitioners'
position
is
accepted,
then
all
the
possible
remedies
under
1983.
now,
what's
involved
in
this
case
between
these
parties,
of
course,
is
attorney's
fees,
but
the
implications
of
this
case
and
the
questions
go
much
farther
than
that.
and
i
would
submit
that
allowing...
not
only
allowing.
we've
already
allowed
states
to
entertain
them,
which
they
may
do
if
they
want,
but
requiring
them
to
enforce
federal
remedies
in
situations
where
congress
has
said
those
same
federal
remedies
we
withhold
in
federal
court
i
think
is
truly
anomalous
indeed.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
reading
from
the
joint
appendix
at
page
20,
which
is
a
part
of
the
petition,
the
plaintiff's
petition
or
complaint
in
this
case--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--where
they
cite
jurisdiction,
they
cite
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
of
this
cation
under
68
o.s.
1981
section
226,
and
title
12,
1651.
1651
of
title
12--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--is
the
declaratory
judgments
act,
and
so
they
specifically
invoked
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
action
under
226.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
actually,
i
have
a
little
bit
sharper
position
than
that.
i
think
they
didn't
plead
in
the
alternative,
they
just
appended
a
1983
statement
in
order
to
claim
attorney's
fees
because
they
weren't
allowed
under
state
law--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--i
believe
that
they
would
have
a...
i
think
they
would
have
a
problem.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
because
i
don't
think
that
basically
would
be
available
under
1983.
first,
if
they
were
not
concerned
about
refunds,
they're
either
going
to
be
in
a
position
of
simply
suing
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
well,
i
would
submit
that
it's
not
that...
what
they're
asking
for
in
your
scenario
would
not
be
provided
for
under
federal
law,
because
they
would
be
in
a
position
of
saying
we
want
a
refund
under
federal
law,
but
you're
suing
the
state
for
the
refund.
that
is
an
action
against
the
state,
notwithstanding
the--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--we're
doing
it
in
state
court,
but
if
the
only
basis--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--for
a
refund
is
1983,
it
doesn't
authorize
one,
at
least
according
to
the
cases,
because
that
in
effect
is
a
suit
for
refund
against
the
state
under
1983,
and
the
state
is
a
person.
i
don't
think
that
1983
actions,
there
is
no
federal
remedy
or
federal
cause
of
action
under
1983
for
a
refund
of
state
taxes.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
because
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
says
that
it
has
to
be
an
action
against
a
person,
and
the
refund
action
is
against
the
state.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
yes.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
yes.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
and
so
i
was
talking
about
if
they
say,
we
want
a
refund
under
federal
law,
it's
not
there,
because
1983
doesn't
provide
it
because
an
action
for
refunds
is
against
the
state.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
because
an
action
against
the
state
for
damages,
for
refunds,
is
not...
has
not
been
permitted
under
1983.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i
believe
so.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i
am
not
aware--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--for
any
purpose
that...
and,
of
course,
i
don't
think
petitioner--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--i
read
it
as
simply
for
what
it
says,
is
that
persons...
and
i
read
it
for
being...
for
purposes
of
1983.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
a
state
is
not
a
person,
and
therefore
i
believe
an
action
for
damages
in
the
nature
of
refunds
i
do
not
believe
would
be
permissible
under
1983,
so
my
answer,
i
think,
to
your
question
is
that
they
would
not
be
successful
if
they
just
disregarded
state
law,
because
their
only
right
to
a
refund
is
provided
by
state
law.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
they
would
have.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
well,
for
one
reason
i
don't
believe
that
we
need
to
take
that
position.
i
don't
think
we
are
required
under
federal
law
to
argue
that
after
the
trial
is
completely
over.
i
think
we
can
argue
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
have
to
apply
any...
or
grant
any
federal
remedies.
we
can
argue
that
in
the
first
instance,
and
that
is
our
position,
that
where
you
have
complete
remedies
under
state
law
that
we
need
not
entertain
a
1983
action
to
a
part
of
the
same--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--i'm
suggesting
it
is
only
in
state
tax--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--that
is
the
structure
of
the
argument,
and
the
argument
is
that
both
19...
1983
and
its
attendant
1988
and
section
1341,
the
tax
injunction,
of
course
they
are
both
expressions
of
policy.
every
act
of
congress
is,
and
at
the
same
time,
we
had
a
congress
wanting
to
make
sure
that
there
were
substantive
remedies
available
and
usable
for
persons
whose
rights,
substantive
rights
under
the
constitution
and
federal
laws
had
been
violated.
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
those
people
had
a
remedy,
and
of
course
when
it
initially
was
passed,
even
if
the
remedy
was
on
the
books,
often
it
wasn't
enforced
till
they
provided
a
federal
forum
and
a
federal
remedy.
they
certainly
provided
a
federal
remedy
now
even
if
it's
enforced
in
the
state
court.
but
at
the
same
time,
that
danger
did
not
then,
and
certainly
does
not
now
exist
in
the
area,
the
realm
of
state
taxes,
and
that
same
congress
who
expressed
the
policy
under
1983
has
also
expressed
a
policy
under
1341
that
the
federal
government,
including
federal
remedies,
should
stay
out
of
state
tax
matters
basically
only
so
long
as
there
is
an
adequate
remedy,
to
the
contrary
of
what
1983
started
out
to
be.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i
suggest
that
the
only
question
that
was
really
presented
in
dennis
is
whether
or
not
the
commerce
clause
granted
rights
and
privileges
which
would
be...
a
violation
of
which
would
be
protected,
or
a
remedy
given
under
1983,
and
i
can
envision,
possibly,
violations
by
state
actors
of
the
commerce
clause
in
areas
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
taxation.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
that
case
itself
is
certainly
a
tax
case.
it
was
one
that...
oklahoma
and
nebraska
were
two
of
the
seven
states
that
were
all
sued
on
the
same
day
by
the
same
people
for
the
same
thing.
this
is
part
of
it,
dennis
and
this
case.
but
i
suggest
that
dennis,
when
it
came
back
on
remand
to
the
state
courts,
i
understand
that
attorney's
fees
were
awarded.
i
am
not
aware
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
needed
to
be
for
reasons,
not
whether
the
commerce
clause
provides
a
basis
for
1983,
but
whether
or
not
state
remedies
are
adequate
and
therefore
the
state
may
not
even
entertain
1983
in
the
first
place
i
don't
believe
were
ever
argued
or
considered
in
dennis.
so
in
that
respect,
if
i
am
right
and
it
had
been
considered,
then
i
think
your
answer
would...
could
be
yes,
it
would
have
been
a
pyrrhic
victory.
it
didn't
happen,
and
so
i
can't
tell
exactly,
but
i
do
believe
that
the
danger
to
the
states
and
their
ability
to
plan
and
administer
their
taxes
is
quite
substantial,
and
could
be
substantial
if
the
court
were
to
open
up
1983
to
the
point
that
it
says
congress
intended
that
you
must
apply
any
remedies
that
might
be
available
under
1983
even
though
you
otherwise
have
adequate
remedies.
it
could
cause,
i
believe,
a
great
disruption
in
state
administration
of
their
own
tax
affairs.
i
do
not
believe
that
was
the
policy
or
intent
of
congress,
and
i
believe
they
showed
that
policy
when
they
prohibited
the
very
same
thing,
prohibited
the
federal
courts
from
doing
the
same
thing.
so
i
would
suggest
that
if
we
accept
the
petitioner's
argument,
it
is
to
accept
the
concept
that
congress
intended
to
prohibit
the
federal
courts
from
interfering
or
supplying
federal
remedies
in
state
tax
matters,
and
then
at
the
same
time,
without
ever
saying
so,
they
intended
to
mandate
that
state
courts
apply
those
federal
remedies.
i
do
not
believe
that
was
the
intent
of
congress,
and
i
believe
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
