mr.
allen,
there
are
other
consequences
upholding
that
the
state
courts
have
to
entertain
section
1983
action
in
state
court,
and
i'd
like
you
to
address
in
the
course
of
your
argument
how
you
think
this
would
play
out,
if
you're
right,
that
they
have
to
entertain
a
1983
action.
what
if
the
state
has
administrative
claims
procedures
in
any
case
involving
ultimately
declaration
or
injunction
of
state
taxes
that
you
have
to
make
this
administrative
claim
first?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know.
i'm
asking
you,
though,
what
you
think
about
a
state's
administrative
claims
procedure,
if
you're
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
the
tax
area
that
can
be
very
troublesome,
and
there...
something
else
occurs
to
me.
we
have
said
in
mckesson
and
like
cases
that
a
state
does
not
have
to
have
a
predeprivation
remedy
for
tax
relief
if
there
is
a
clear
and
certain
and
prompt
postdeprivation
remedy.
now,
to
allow
the
1983
action
would
mean
in
every
instance,
i
guess,
a
plea
deprivation
determination.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you're
coming
in
claiming
the
right
to
declaratory
and/or
injunctive
relief...
state,
you
can't
get
these
taxes.
now,
that
is
in
the
nature,
i
think,
of
a
predeprivation
remedy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's...
you
know,
that's
precisely
what
this
court
has
been
careful
to
say
the
states
don't
have
to
do,
that
they
can
at
least
require
people
to
pay
their
taxes
and
litigate
later
and
follow
certain
claims
procedures
in
doing
so--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
i
think
you
have
a
strong
argument,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
if
you're
right,
and
if
no
adjustments
are
appropriate
here,
that
it
would
have
a
rather
dramatic
effect
on
established
law
in
this
area.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
file
1983,
you
get
a
preliminary
injunction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
the
way
it
works,
and
there
you
are.
there
the
state
is,
can't
collect
the
tax.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
an
injunction--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
declaratory
relief.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
for
damages.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
are,
by
their
nature,
equitable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
assume,
then,
that
it
is
possible
that
the
notion
that
states
can
provide
adequate
postdeprivation
remedies
at
law
could
be
a
principle
that
would
enable
the
state
court
to
say,
we
will
deny
equitable
relief,
because
there's
a
plain,
speedy
remedy
at
law
here,
no
equitable
relief.
how
would
that
work?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
remedy
sought
in
the
state
court
is
essentially
an
equitable
one,
would
it
not
be
open
to
the
state
court
to
deny
an
injunction
or
declaratory
relief
on
the
grounds
that
we
have
in
this
state
a
plain,
a
speedy,
an
adequate
remedy
at
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--yes,
but
mr.
allen,
the
reality
is
the
state
court
is
going
to
want
to
say
we're
not
going
to
litigate
this
to
finality
because
there
is
a
plain,
speedy,
adequate
remedy
at
law.
you
pay
your
taxes,
and
then
you
litigate
it,
and
you're
not
going
to
decide
the
merits
of
this
case
in
the
present
posture.
now,
that's
what
a
state
court
would
like
to
say--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
it
seems
to
me
that
faced
with
the
notion
that
we
have
recognized
an
equitable
defense,
if
you
will,
to
injunctive
or
equitable
relief,
that
that
might
be
perfectly
proper.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
taxpayer
complied
with
all
of
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
your
claim
is
limited
to
just
saying,
but
no
1983
action
will
lie
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
of
course,
if
the
petitioners
are
right,
they
get
attorney's
fees,
and
i
guess
attorney's
fees
would
not
be
available
under
state
law.
