justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
oklahoma
supreme
court.
in
order
to
retaliate
against
states
that
impose
what
it
considers
discriminatory
taxes
on
trucks
registered
in
oklahoma.
the
state
of
oklahoma
similarly
imposed
taxes
on
trucks
that
conducted
business
in
that
state
but
were
registered
in
the
offending
states.
pursuant
to
state
law
and
42
u.s.c.
1983
petitioners
filed
a
class
action
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
courts
challenging
the
taxes
as
unconstitutional.
petitioners
sought
refunds
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
as
well
as
attorney’s
fees
under
section
1988.
after
a
series
of
decisions
in
the
oklahoma
courts
and
the
remand
from
this
court,
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
held
that
the
taxes
were
unconstitutional
and
ordered
oklahoma
to
award
refunds
pursuant
to
state
law
relying
upon
the
principle
of
interstate
uniformity.
the
court
did
not
grant
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief
under
1983.
the
court
reasoned
that
petitioner
should
not
secure
relief
in
state
court
that
could
not
be
awarded
in
federal
court
because
it
granted
no
relief
under
section
1983
the
court
did
not
award
attorney’s
fees
under
section
1988.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
affirm
the
long
standing
federal
reluctance
to
interfere
with
state
taxation
leads
us
to
conclude
that
in
state
tax
cases
congress
did
not
authorize
courts
to
issue
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief
when
an
adequate
remedy
exists
at
law.
our
cases
have
made
clear
that
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
have
the
potential
to
disrupt
the
administration
of
state
taxes.
before
the
passage
of
section
1983
this
potential
for
disruption
led
to
the
establishment
of
a
principle
of
noninterference
with
state
taxation
when
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
as
our
subsequent
cases
indicate
section
1983
did
not
disturb
this
principle.
construing
§
1983
in
light
of
this
principle
we
conclude
that
congress
has
not
authorized
courts
to
award
equitable
or
declaratory
relief
when
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
exist.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
