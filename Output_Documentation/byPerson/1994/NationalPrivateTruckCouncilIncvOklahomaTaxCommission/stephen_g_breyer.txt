justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you're
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view,
as
everyone
is,
of
tax
law,
but
forgetting
tax
law
for
the
moment,
isn't
it
normal
that
the
1983
remedy
is
treated
as,
if
state
law
gives
a
plaintiff
all
the
remedies
that
1983
gives
them
but
attorney's
fees,
still
they
recover
attorney's
fees
under
1983?
isn't
that
the
normal
rule,
because
you
could
have
two
causes
of
action
get
you
to
the
same
result,
but
congress
wanted
to
give
these
civil
rights
plaintiffs
attorney's
fees.
and
then
the
question
becomes,
well,
why
should
you
make
an
exception
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that,
it
seemed
to
me,
which
is
a
very
strong
argument,
would
argue
for
an
exception
to
the
no
exhaustion
principle.
you
see,
that's...
the
no
exhaustion
principle
is
read
into
1983-88
via
this
court's
decision
in
patsy
v.
regents,
and
there
were
strong
policy
reasons
for
doing
that,
and
reading
that,
and
you
have
very
strong
policy
reasons
as
to
not
to
interfere.
but
don't...
i
mean,
maybe
the...
i'm
not
suggesting
this
is
a
conclusion.
the
policy
reasons
might
read
out
the
no
exhaustion,
and
if
they
read
out
the
no
exhaustion,
then
the
main
policy
objection
to
applying
it
is
gone
but
for
attorney's
fees,
and
yet
we
have
a
basic
congressional
decision
that
you
get
your
attorney's
fees
when
something
violates
the
civil
rights
act
as
well
as
violating
state
law.
that's
what
i'd
appreciate
a
reaction
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
there
some
reason
it
wasn't
intended
to
apply
in...
for
violations
of
the
commerce
clause,
whereas
it
was
intended
to
apply
for
violations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
in
other
words,
the
thing
that's
worrying
me
about
this
entire
case
is
the...
not
this
area,
but
what
the
impact
is
on
some
other
area,
and
whether
it's
possible
to
create
an
exception
here,
and
why
would
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
would
have
succeeded
in
one
of
their
objectives,
which
was
to
get
the
state
law
declared
unconstitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
under
normal
1983
law
they
would
be
a
prevailing
party
entitled
to
attorney's
fees,
and
the
only
way
i
guess
you
can
avoid
it
is
if
the
state
has
a
right
not
to
put
1983
in
state
court
in
tax
matters.
i
can't
think
of
any
other
way
to
avoid
it,
and
then
the
only
way--
--well,
they're
not
entitled
to
attorney's
fees
anyway,
are
they?
i
mean,
as
i
read
1988
it
says
the
court
in
its
discretion
may
allow
the
prevailing...
why
don't
you
just
argue
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
federal
courts
in
cases
like
this
to
allow
the
attorney's
fees...
for
state
courts?
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
and
is
that
just
in
tax
cases,
or
is
that
also
in
a
case
where
there
is
state
laws
of
assault
and
battery
and
all
kinds
of
other
laws,
and
the
person
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
makes
exactly
the
same
claim
for
attorney's
fees,
and
does
this
rule
apply
there,
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
it's
only...
the
only
way,
i
guess...
i'm
not
arguing
with
you
as
much
as
i'm
trying
to
think
it
through,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
but
the
only
basis
you
have
for
saying
that
is
because
of
the
tax
injunction
act,
and
now
the
tax
injunction
act,
you'd
have
to
look
into
the
policies
underlying
that.
and
then
once
i
get
to
the
policies
underlying
it,
that's
why
i
came
back
to
the
idea
which
is
only
experimental
about
the
possibility
that
that
act
justifies
doing
away
with
the
exhaustion
requirement,
but
that's
the
structure
of
the
argument.
there
isn't
some
other
problem
that's
caused,
or
some
other
reason.
