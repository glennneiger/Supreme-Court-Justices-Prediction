justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
if
all
you
were
entitled
to
under
some
of
the
earlier
suppositions
was
a
future
injunction,
are
your
attorney's
fees
just
limited
to
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
there
were
adequate
remedies
under
state
law,
and
all
you're
saying
is
that
you...
your
argument
earlier
was,
at
least
you're
entitled
to
a
future
injunction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
your
attorney's
fees
limited
to
just
the
value
of
obtaining
the
future
injunction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
neither
do
i.
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
adequate
legal
remedies,
and
the
point
of
the
chief
justice's
question,
i
thought,
at
least
to
me,
was
why
are
you
entitled
to
an
injunction
under
normal,
equitable
principles,
and
why
cannot
we
elaborate
those
equitable
principles
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
in
tax
injunction
suits
under
1983?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
now,
but
the
chief
justice's
question
pertained
to
a
preliminary
injunction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
ask
in
the
prayer
for
relief
against
the
officer
as
a
named
officer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
your
complaint
on
page
26
you
ask
for
injunction
against
the
oklahoma
tax
commission.
it's
at
page
26
of
the
joint
appendix.
just
as
a
matter
of
pleading,
aren't
you
supposed
to
name
the
officer--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
come
within
the
ex
parte
young--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--not
in
the
prayer
for
relief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
wasn't
that
an
eleventh
amendment--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--your
position
is
that
our
footnote
in
will
was
not
confined
or
controlled
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
it
was
just
an
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
1983.
