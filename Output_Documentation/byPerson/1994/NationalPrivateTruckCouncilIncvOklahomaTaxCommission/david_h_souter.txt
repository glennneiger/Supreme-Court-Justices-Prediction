justice
david
h.
souter
--but
it's
a
burden,
in
any
case,
it's
a
burden
that
can
economically
be
redressed.
after
the
election
is
over,
you
can't
go
back
and
vote
again.
i
mean,
there's
no
economic
equivalence
there,
whereas
in
the
trucking
case
there
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
i
suppose
that
isn't
what
the
court
would
do.
the
court
wouldn't
go
through
a
prepayment
adjudication.
the
court
would
simply
say,
we
don't
enjoin.
if
you
want
to
challenge
this
tax,
you've
got
to
pay
it,
and
we'll
adjudicate
it
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
wouldn't
say
you're
going
to
win
your
case
before
it's
heard
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that
doesn't
go...
it
seems
to
me...
i
agree
with
you,
but
that
doesn't
go
to
the
point
of
the
hypothetical.
the
point
of
the
hypothetical
is,
if
you
have
an
adequate
remedy
of
law
after
the
fact,
you,
the
petitioner
for
the
relief,
are
not
entitled
to
a
prepayment
adjudication.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
if
you
win
in
this
case,
is
the
implication
that
the
judge
would
have
had
to
do
something
different
at
the
preliminary
stage?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
agree
that
if,
in
fact,
there
is
a
postdeprivation
remedy,
even
if
the
court
is
required
to
entertain
at
least
some
claim
for
relief
under
1983,
it
would
not
have
to
provide
a
predeprivation
remedy?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
wouldn't
have
to
provide
a
remedy
to
your
petitioner
before
your
petitioner
paid
the
tax.
do
you
agree?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
all
of
this
turns,
i
take
it,
on
there
being
no
exhaustion
requirement,
which
in
essence
this
would
be.
is
that
the
basis
for
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
as
an
adequate...
i
suppose
you
can
look
at
an
adequate
remedy
of
law
as
being
a
base
that
has
to
be
touched,
and
if
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
of
law,
you
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
any
injunctive
relief
unless
that
remedy
for
some
peculiar
reason
is
denied
to
you,
and
i
took
it
that
what
you
were
arguing
was,
there's
no
exhaustion
requirement
in
1983.
if
you
impose
the
adequacy
of
the
legal
remedy
criterion
you
in
effect
are
imposing
an
exhaustion
requirement,
and
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
1983
cases.
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
is
not
your
argument,
then
i
guess
i
don't
understand
what
your
argument
is
based
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
assumed...
that
assumed
that
1983
would
apply.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
didn't
it...
i
mean,
wouldn't
it
have
been
pointless
if
it
had
not
assumed
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
what's...
i
guess
what
i'm...
what
perplexes
me
is
1983
was
not
required
to
authorize
the
federal
courts
to
give
those
remedies.
why
was
1983
required
to
give
the
federal
courts
authority
to
provide
remedies
in
fourteenth
amendment
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
of
the
way
it's
written.
