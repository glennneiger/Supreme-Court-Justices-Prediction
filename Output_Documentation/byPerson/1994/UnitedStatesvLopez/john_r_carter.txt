mr.
john
r.
carter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
american
people
established
the
national
government,
if
they
had
then
invested
it
with
a
general
police
power,
there'd
be
little
problem
with
laws
like
the
gun-free
school
zones
act.
state
legislators
possess
general
police
powers,
and
they
pass
laws
like
this
all
the
time.
mr.
john
r.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
carter
it
might
very
well
be,
if
that
act
were,
in
fact
interfering
with
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
r.
carter
the...
let
me
back
pedal,
then,
a
little
bit
on
my
statement
regarding
preemption.
i
think
the
preemption
would
apply
at...
on
the
interstate
highway.
mr.
john
r.
carter
if
the
court
found...
i
believe
if
the
court
found--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--that
the
state
law
was
burdening
interstate
commerce,
which
i
don't
believe
it
would
find,
but
assuming
that...
i
was
assuming
in
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
that
there
would
be
a
finding
that
it
burdened--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--interstate
commerce
and
in
that
case,
the
case
law
i
believe
would...
that's
one
of
the
dangers
of
preemption
of
state
law
by
commerce
clause
legislation.
mr.
john
r.
carter
that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
carter
well,
that's
an
argument
that
seems
to
me
to
have
been
raised
at
argument
today.
it's
not
something
that
the
government's
argued
in
its
brief.
mr.
john
r.
carter
yes,
i
believe
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--i'll
disclaim
it
to
a...
large
extent,
yes,
although
i
believe
that
justice
kennedy's
rationale
for
clear
statement
principles
in
commerce
clause
cases
is
a
very
good
one,
and
illustrates
why
you
can't
simply
have
laws
like
the
gun-free
school
zones
act,
which
on
its
face
appears
to
be
a
general
police
power
statute.
it
makes
no
mention
of
commerce,
what
it
regulates
is
not
commerce,
it's
got
no
legislative
history
dealing
with
commerce--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--that--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--that
would
call
for
a
different
analysis
by
this
court
under
its
prior
case
law.
this
court
has
been
very
deferential
to
the
regulation
of
activities
affecting
interstate
commerce
where
congress
has
made
findings.
mr.
john
r.
carter
those
particular
findings
are
awfully
global.
i
have
a
lot
of
problem
with
those--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--i
would--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--under
my
theory,
shooting
from
the
hip
today,
i
would
question
their
validity.
they...
i
do
not
believe
they
draw
a
tight
enough
nexus
with
commerce.
to
explain
why
i
back-pedal--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--under
this
court's
precedent,
if
they
say
enough,
then
it
triggers
the
deferential
standard
of
review.
mr.
john
r.
carter
one
can
make
that
argument
from
this
court's
prior
case
law,
yes.
mr.
john
r.
carter
i...
i'm
trying
to
make
an
argument
that
comports
the
court's
prior
case
law,
which,
as
a
practitioner
of
law,
i'm
in
a
position...
not
in
a
very
good
position
to
question,
with
what
happened
here,
and
how
very
different
this
law
is
even
from
prior
legislation
which
doesn't
appear
to
regulate
the
concerns
that
you've
identified
but
the
court
has
upheld.
for
example,
the
loan-sharking
case
in
perez.
the
court
upheld
the
law
there.
that
law
at
least
had
findings.
mr.
john
r.
carter
i
would...
i
would
agree
with
you
100
percent
on
that.
the
court,
however,
did
not
specifically
recognize
that
as
its
rationale.
believe
me,
i
wish
it
had,
because
i
think
you're
absolutely
correct
that
when
congress
reaches
to
regulate
intrastate,
noncommercial
activity
without
some
strong,
strong
connection,
i...
and
the
first
cases
which
expanded
into
this
area
talked
about
a
close
and
substantial
connection,
and
somehow
along
the
way
that
gets
transferred
into
rational
relationship.
and
i
would
welcome
the
court
to
look
at
the
cases
which
opened
this
door
and
examine
more
closely
how
it
has
continued
to
erode
over
the
years,
in
that
we
have
a
situation
now
where
the
solicitor
general
can
argue
that
congress
has
almost
plenary
power
over
crimes.
mr.
john
r.
carter
that
is
my
duty
as
his
attorney.
mr.
john
r.
carter
yes.
yes,
there
is
a,
i
think
a
very
obvious
difference
between
the
simple
possession
of
a
gun
within
1,000
feet
of
a
school
which
can
be
for
lawful
or
unlawful
purposes,
and
the
discharge
of
a
gun,
even,
i
think,
in
cases
where
the
discharge
of
itself
might
be
lawful.
mr.
john
r.
carter
simple--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--types
of
assault
weapons.
under
my
theory,
congress
made
in
1968
findings
about
what
it
called
highly
destructive
weapons.
congress
has
regulated
machine
guns
and
what
it...
what
it...
it
used
the
term
firearm,
but
statutorily
defined
to
be
the
more
highly
destructive
weapons
in
the
national
firearms
from
1934
to
the
present.
i
believe
that
would
rest
on
a
different
constitutional
basis,
because
some
of
the
offsetting
considerations...
for
example,
congress'
longstanding
recognition
of
the
lawful
possession
of
firearms
for
sporting
purposes.
mr.
john
r.
carter
if,
in
an
individual
instance,
it
affected
interstate
commerce--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--absent
some
finding
by
congress
linking
it
to
its
commerce
power--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--i
believe
it
would
stand
on
the
same
footing.
mr.
john
r.
carter
because
the
findings
are
made
by
a
subsequent
congress.
this
court
has
been...
has
in
the
past
indicated
that
that's--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--this
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
congress'
prior
findings
regarding
the
effect--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--because
we're
talking...
we're
not
talking
about
something
that
happened
today,
we're
talking
about
something
that
happened
in
1992,
before
those
findings
were
made.
mr.
john
r.
carter
that
would
retroactively
convict
mr.
lopez
under
a
different
theory
than
he
was
prosecuted
under,
in
that
this
court
has
also
considered
findings--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--well,
congress
in
1990
could
have
linked
gun
possession
in
a
school
zone
with
commerce
in
another
way
besides
findings.
it
could
have
made
it
an
element
of
the
offense.
and
when
you
examine
congressional
regulation
of
firearm
possession,
which
is
mostly
in
section
922,
they
more
often
use
the
commerce
element
as
part
of
the
offense,
and
for
this
court,
or
to
assume
that
congress
in
1994,
by
passing
findings,
is
doing
what
congress
may
have
wanted
to
do
in
1990,
ignores
the
very
real
possibility
that
congress
could
have
done
the
same
thing
in
1990
by
requiring
an
element,
and
in
that
case,
it
would
have
had
to
have
been
part
of
the
indictment
and
proof
in
mr.
lopez'
case.
mr.
john
r.
carter
i
think--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--i
think
in
my
own
awkward
way
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
say.
[laughter]
mr.
john
r.
carter
they
very
well
could
have.
mr.
john
r.
carter
i
don't...
i
would
think...
i
don't
see
how
they
can
be
retroactively
acceptable.
mr.
john
r.
carter
i
would...
i
would--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--i
would
agree
100
percent.
the
congress
can't
go
back
and
change
time.
it
can
judge
the
facts
today,
and
this
is
a
factual
determination.
it's
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite.
mr.
john
r.
carter
my
first
reply
to
that
is
this
act
reaches
more
than
guns
in
schools.
it
reaches
guns
near
schools,
it
reaches
the
lawful
possession
of
guns
in
schools.
it
reaches
beyond
congress'
power.
that's
the
biggest
problem
with
this
act.
i'm
not
arguing
that
congress
has
no
power
to
regulate
firearms
anywhere
near
schools.
what
i'm
arguing
is
that
this
act,
as
you
read
it,
is
a
general
police
power
type
legislation,
and
that
is
not
the
power
that
congress
has.
mr.
john
r.
carter
i
don't
believe
it
would
diminish
the
constitution.
if
anything,
it
would
formalize
procedures
for
congress
to
take.
it
would
recognize--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--it...
i
wouldn't
view
it
as...
in
quite
the
same
sense
as
you
do,
justice
scalia.
the
requirement
of
findings
ensures
that
congress
addresses
problems
that
this
court
has
recognized.
in
the
bass
case,
the
court
speaks
of
being
sure
that
congress
has
indeed
addressed
the
problem
and
thought
about
the
state-federal
balance.
without
something
like
findings,
there's
no
insurance
that
that
has
in
fact
happened,
and
it's--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--in
an
area
of
noncommercial
activity,
and
in
a
statute
that
reaches
as
broadly
as
this
one,
i
think
the
presumption
that
congress
undertook
all
these
steps
which
would
be
formalized
with
findings
evaporates,
because
otherwise
we're
in
a
situation
where,
as
justice
souter
quoted
benjamin
franklin,
you
can
rationalize
regulation
of
any
human
activity
as
affecting
commerce.
mr.
john
r.
carter
no.
my
argument
about
the
discharge
of
a
firearm
was
aimed
at
the
rational
relation
test.
if
this
court
finds
that
this
statute
is
simply
subject
to
the
same
deferential
standard
of
review
as
a
statute
with
findings,
as--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--no.
the
purpose
of
my
illustration
of
discharge
is
to
show
how
even
more
further
attenuated
this
statute
is,
that
there's
a
closer--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--without
a...
having
an
effect
on
commerce,
yes,
that--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--i
think--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--a
discharge
statute,
simply
outlawing
all
discharges--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--i
would
think
that
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
r.
carter
that
would
be
more
rational
than
what
we're
facing
here.
i--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--not
for
me.
mr.
john
r.
carter
that's--
[laughter]
i
don't
think
so.
i
hope
not.
mr.
john
r.
carter
i
would
think
that
that,
as
stated
by
you,
would
be
of
very
doubtful
constitutionality.
i
can't,
on
my
feet,
think
of
any
constitu--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--i
think,
as
stated
by
you,
that
would
be
of
doubtful
constitutionality
where
it
would
also--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--yes,
and
i
think
it
would
raise
questions
under
new
york
v.
u.s.
about
ordering
the
schools,
what
congress
can
and
cannot
order
states
to
do.
mr.
john
r.
carter
i
don't
believe
it
did.
the
fifth
circuit
left...
for
example,
the
fifth
circuit
left
open
the
question
of
whether
a
commerce
element
could
be
implied
into
this
statute,
which
is
sort
of
another
alternative
to
findings.
congress--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--if
i'm--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--then
this
court
must
address
the
question
of,
if
congress
had
the
power
to
do
what
it
did
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
john
r.
carter
well,
the
court
could
direct
it...
remand
it
to
the
cong...
i
mean,
to
the
fifth
circuit
in
light
of
the
court's
decision
here,
of
course.
mr.
john
r.
carter
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
an
option
open
to
this
court.
mr.
john
r.
carter
i--
[laughter]
i
agree
there's...
i
don't
view
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
what
i'm
advocating
here
as
requiring
this
court
to
throw
out
the
concept
that
congress
can
reach
activities
which
have
a
close
and
substantial
relation
to
interstate
commerce,
and
then
the
question,
to
reach...
i'd
really
be
simply
restating
your
question.
i
think
there's
a
more...
a
much
more
open
and...
must
more
close
and
substantial
relation
to
an
act
of
violence
directed
against
a
school,
an
occupied
classroom,
than...
than
there
is
in
simply
possessing
a
firearm
near
one,
and
line-drawing
is,
you
know,
is
something
the
court
does,
and
i
don't
really
wish
to
be
back-pedaling
on
this,
but
that's
not
the
issue
here.
the
issue
is
even
more
broader
than
that.
if...
if
banning
simple
possession
of
a
firearm
near
a
school
is
unconstitutional,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
throwing
a
firebomb
into
an
occupied
classroom
is.
there...
under
the
court's
previous
standard,
it's...
and
i
believe
the
court
said
that
it's
a
question
of
degree.
mr.
john
r.
carter
that's
been
justified
under
the
commerce
and
the
foreign
commerce
power
and
the
problems
of
indistinguishability
from--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--the
courts
have
so
held,
yes.
mr.
john
r.
carter
well,
there's
findings
made
by
congress
regarding
marijuana.
there's
no
question
of
the
peaceful,
lawful
possession
of
marijuana
in
any
state.
there's--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--if
that
were
necessary
to
exercise
congress'
commerce
powers--
mr.
john
r.
carter
--i
think
the
prohibition
on
that
basis
would
have
to
be
limited
to
students.
mr.
john
r.
carter
under
that
rationale,
there'd
be
no
rational
relation
between
nonstudents
and
smoking
marijuana
and
their
effect.
in
sum,
i'd
urge
this
court
to
recognize
the
government's
argument
for
what
it
truly
is.
mr.
john
r.
carter
the
government's
arguing
that
the
commerce
clause
gives
the
federal
government
a
general
police
power
that
it
wasn't
given
by
the
constitution,
and
this
act
doesn't
regulate
commerce,
it
doesn't
regulate
interstate
activity,
and
because
congress
may
possess
some
powers
to
regulate
guns
around
schools
doesn't
mean
that
it
exercised
its
power
in
this
case,
in
this
act.
and
to
uphold
the
gun-free
school
zones
act
under
deferential
review
on
the
government's
theory
that
findings
are
somehow
implicit
would
allow
any
limitations
on
the
congress'
commerce
clause
powers
to
vanish,
and
the
line
beyond
which
its
powers
would
not
reach
is
then
the
horizon,
a
line
which
appears
but
can
never
be
reached.
i
would
yield
my
further
time.
mr.
john
r.
carter
i
believe
so.
mr.
john
r.
carter
and
that
is
the
basis
of
a
lot
of
regulation
of
firearms.
mr.
john
r.
carter
yes,
and
most
of
it
is
today.
mr.
john
r.
carter
correct,
or
to
possess
with
intent
to
affect
interstate
commerce
i
believe
may
be
regulable.
mr.
john
r.
carter
the
gun,
i
believe,
yes.
the
marijuana,
because
there
are
elements
of
indistinguishable...
indistinguishability
from
foreign
marijuana,
which
congress
has,
i
believe,
plenary
power
to
regulate,
there's...
it's
a
closer
question.
i
thank
you.
