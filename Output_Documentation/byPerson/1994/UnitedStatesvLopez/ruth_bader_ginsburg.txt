justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
days,
just
to
understand
what
we're
talking
about,
do
i
correctly
understand
your
position
to
be,
your
rationale
for
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
all
violent
crime,
if
congress
so
desired,
could
be
placed
under
a
federal
wing,
could
be
placed
in
the
federal
court
for
prosecution,
all
violent
crime,
or
is
there
any
stopping
point?
is
there
any
violent
crime
that
doesn't
affect
interstate
commerce
on
you
rationale?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
days--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
by
repeatedly
bringing
up
the
nuclear
waste
case
you
were
making
the
distinction...
perhaps
you
weren't...
between
federal
regulations
concurrent
with
state
regulation,
as
it
would
be
in
this
case,
and
federal
regulations
displacing
state
regulation,
taking
over
the
field.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
making
that
distinction,
and
is
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
days,
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
making...
you're
presenting
what
has
sometimes
been
called
a
political
question
argument,
that
is,
that
there
are
some
decisions
that
are
committed
to
another
branch
to
determine
the
constitutionality.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying
that
what
is
within
commerce
or
not
is
for
congress
to
decide,
and
that
the
courts
don't
have
an
oversight
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
the
limits,
then?
you
said
it
could
be
all
of
violent
crime
could
come
within
it.
you're
not
making
the
distinction
between
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
displacing
the
state
authority,
so
what
is
the
check?
how
would
you
describe
the
check
that
the
court
has?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
be
a
case
that
would
fall
outside,
other
than
the
one
that
you...
the
nuclear
waste,
telling
the
state,
in
effect,
you
serve
as
federal
official
for
this
purpose?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
it
had
the
findings
that
have
been
subsequently
added,
would
that
be
sufficient--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
your
duty.
and
that's
the
same
reason
why
you
suggested
that
the...
in
this
very
same
statute
the
prohibition
on
discharging
a
gun
might
present
a
different
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
make
sense
for
us
to
say
that
the
only
flaw
in
this
legislation
is
the
one
you're
pushing,
because
it's
so
obviously
easy
to
get
up
a
set
of
findings.
it
would
be
diminishing
the
constitution,
i
think,
if
you
impose
that
kind
of,
almost
school-ma'am
requirement
on
congress.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
emphasize
in
the
beginning
that
you
are
an
advocate
for
a
particular
client,
and
so
you're
concentrating
on
the
absence
of
findings.
as
i
understand
the
fifth
circuit
decision,
it
didn't
go
beyond
the
absence
of
findings.
did
the
fifth
circuit
reach
the
question
of
what
if
there
were
findings?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
you're
wrong
about
the
necessity
for
findings,
then
what
happens
to
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
all
that
the
fifth
circuit
decided,
that
findings
are
needed,
and
if
we
decide...
follow
the
ordinary
presumption
that
congress
had
a
reason
for
what
it
did--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
though
that
would
be
taking
a
first
view
of
that
question,
because
it
was
not
decided
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
we
are
ordinarily
not
a
court
of
first
view.
