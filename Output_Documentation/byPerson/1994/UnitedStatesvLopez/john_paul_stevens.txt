john

--well,
wouldn't
you
say,
just...
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
it
relates
to
her
question.
supposing
a
state
had
a
law
saying,
it
is
permissible
for
children
to
bring
weapons
to
school
to
defend
themselves
against
the
risk
of
violence.
do
you
think
the
federal
government
could
preempt
that
law
with
a
law
like
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
days,
could
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
general
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
filed
in
a
recent
submission
copies
of
congressional
findings
made
in
the
recently
enacted
crime
control
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
relevance
do
you
think
those
findings
have
to
our
problem
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
decided
the
case
the
same
way
if
those
findings
had
been
in
the
original
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
an
argument
that
was
disclaimed,
as
i
understood
the
solicitor
general.
he
disclaimed
that
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
helpful
to
me
if
you'd
answer
the
question...
whether
the
explosive
device
or
machine
gun,
just
possession
of
one
or
the
other
within
1,000
feet
of
a
school,
could
be
prohibited
by
congress.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
the
same...
you've
got
exactly
the
same
statute
you
have
here,
except
you
substitute
for
firearm
the
word,
machine
gun,
or
explosive
device.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
the
same
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
we
have
the
findings.
we
do
have
findings
now.
why
can't
we
take
judicial
notice
of
the
facts
congress
have
found?
maybe
they're
not
sufficient,
but
what
is
the
difference
whether
the...
whether
it's
in
the
finding,
or
something
that
everybody
knows?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
if
they
had,
for
example,
made
a
regulation
of
railroad
transportation
and
didn't
make
the
finding
that
this
involves
interstate
commerce
we
couldn't
take
judicial
notice
of
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
can't
we
take
judicial
notice
of
what
they
found
today,
or
just
a
couple
of
weeks
ago?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it's
the
same
statute,
and
either
that
does
affect
commerce
or
it
doesn't,
and
i
don't
know
why
the
findings
make
any
difference.
that's
what
you
have
to
explain
to
me,
why
the
findings
make
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
that's
right,
because
he
was
prosecuted
under
a
statute
that
was
on
the
books,
and
the
statute
is
either
valid
or
invalid
because
it
does
or
does
not
have
an
adequate
connection
with
commerce,
and
i
don't
know
that
congress,
when
congress
makes
the
findings
has
anything
to
do
with
that...
with
whether
in
fact
it
has
a
justifiable
connection
with
commerce.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
carter--
--you're
trying
to
say
that
some
of
the
facts
underlying
these
findings
have
changed
in
the
last
2
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
ones?
[laughter]
i
think
that's
really
quite
ridiculous.
if
you
look
at
these
findings,
they're
either
acceptable
or
they're
not,
and
maybe
they're
not,
i
agree
with
you,
but
there's
really
been
no
change.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
argument,
but
that's
not
saying
that
the
facts
underlying
the
findings
have
changed
in
the
last
2
years.
i
don't
think
anyone
would
accept
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
a
statute
that
prohibits
the
conduct
of
school
classes
in
rooms
where
there's
a
lot
of
asbestos
in
the
wall
or
the
ceiling,
just
prohibition.
just
like
no
guns...
one
section
says,
no
guns
in
the
schoolroom,
another
section
says,
the
room
cannot
have
asbestos
in
it,
period.
no
findings
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
go
one
step
further
and
require
them
to
remove
asbestos
wherever
it
is
on
the
school
premises,
also
remove
all
explosive
devices
at
the
same
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
simple
possession
of
marijuana?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
position
is
that
would
be
permissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
theory
that
marijuana
is
more
apt
to
be
moved
in
commerce...
i
mean,
you
can
have
locally
grown
marijuana,
i
suppose...
or
on
the
ground
that
it's
more
harmful
than
the
guns?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
assuming
a
state
doesn't
prohibit
the
mere
possessio,
but
might
the
federal
government
nevertheless
prohibit
mere
possession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
makes
precisely
the
same
findings.
if
the
kids
smoke
marijuana,
they'll
be
poor
students,
and
education
will
suffer,
and
the
economy
will
suffer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
students.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
just
possess
with
intent
to
use
either
a
gun
or
marijuana
would
be
beyond
the
federal
power?
