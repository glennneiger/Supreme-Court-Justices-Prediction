justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
days,
we
have
really
not
been
too...
what
should
i
say,
too
strict
about,
you
know,
what
the
farthest
reach
of
the
commerce
clause
may
be.
but
as
i
read
our
cases,
the
ones
that
are
most
often
cited,
indeed,
i
think
all
of
them,
involve
the
issue
of
whether
some
commercial
activity
of
some
sort...
renting
a
hotel
room,
growing
a
commodity
that
is
used
in
commerce...
whether
some
commercial
activity
is
interstate
commerce
or
not,
and
one
can
say
we're
prepared
to
be
very
broadminded
about
that.
if
congress
says
some
commercial
activity
is
interstate
commerce,
or
affects
interstate
commerce,
that's
okay.
but
here
you
have
regulation
of
something
that
is
not
commercial
activity
in
any
sense
of
the
word,
merely
the
possession
of
an
item.
justice
antonin
scalia
might
we
not
apply
a
different
rule
in
that
case
than
we
do...
i
mean,
give
up
the
whole
realm
of
commerce
to
the
federal
government.
say,
anything
that
relates
to
commerce,
the
federal
government
can
control,
securities
regulation,
all
sorts
of
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
has
to
relate
to
commerce.
this
doesn't
relate
to
commerce,
even.
justice
antonin
scalia
noncommercial
activities
that
affect
commerce.
what
cases
do
you
have
that
involve
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
noncommercial
activities
that
affect
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
have
we
ever
held...
i'm
talking
about
cases
of
ours.
what
cases
of
ours
would
stand
in
the
way
of
a
stricter...
of
a
stricter
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
where
the
activity
in
question
is
not
commercial
activity?
what
cases--
justice
antonin
scalia
federal
schools
with
federal
teachers,
all
federal
money--
justice
antonin
scalia
domestic
violence,
i'm
aware.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
question
is
whether
it
has
dealt
with
them
constitutionally.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
what
your
answer
is.
is
it...
would
a
federal
marriage
and
divorce
law
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
give
away
anything
here.
[laughter]
they
might
want
to
do
it
next--
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
so,
the
states
cannot
prohibit
crimes
on
interstate
highways?
all
crimes
that
occur
on
interstate
highways
have
to
be
punished
by
federal
criminal
law
and
not
by
state
criminal
law?
this
is
new.
i
just
thought
it
was
federal
enclaves.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
would
make
such
a
finding
of
burdening
interstate
commerce
presumably
because
we
believe
we
have
the
capacity
to
figure
out
what
is
interstate
commerce
and,
indeed,
much
beyond
that,
what
burdens
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
of
course,
the
argument
made
here
is
that
we
don't
have
that
capacity,
because
it's
a
political
question.
it
seems
to
me
we
have
it
or
we
don't
have
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
disclaim
it,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
just
have
to
say
more,
but
so
long
as
they
say
enough,
whether
it's
true
or
not,
it's
okay,
is
that
it,
and
we
would
not
inquire
as
to
whether
it's
true
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
basically
you
have
a
client
you're
trying
to
keep
out
of
jail,
and
as
far
as
you're
concerned
it's
enough
to
say
they
didn't
make
the
findings
and
let
us
worry
about
the
rest
some
other
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
--we're
making
up
this
procedural
requirement,
anyway.
why
can't
we
say--
[laughter]
--you
have
to
make
these
findings
either
at
the
time
you
pass
it,
or
later,
so
long
as
the
case
comes
up
after
you've
made
the
findings?
that's
a
sensible
procedural
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
your
answer
that
what
congress
finds
to
have
been
true
in
1994
is
not
necessarily
what
congress
would
have
found
to
have
been
true
in
1990?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
an
adequate
answer
to
keep
your
client
out
of
jail?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
finding
requirement
is
a
finding
requirement,
isn't
it,
and
if
you
insist
upon
a
finding
by
congress,
surely
that
finding
has
to
be
a
finding
related
to
1990,
or,
you
know,
whenever
the
even
occurred--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
there
is
no
finding
relating
to
that
date.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
no
authority
under
the
constitution
to
prescribe
procedures
for
congress.
can
we
tell
congress
how
it
must
legislate?
where
do
we
get
the
authority
to
say
that?
this
is
not
an
interpretive
rule.
i
mean,
we
have
the
power
to
adopt
rules
of
interpretation.
unless
something
is
clear
in
the
statute,
we
will
not
assume
it
to
be
true.
but
this
isn't
an
interpretive
rule
you're
urging
upon
us,
it's
a
rule
saying
that
even
though
it's
perfectly
clear
what
congress
intended,
we're
not
going
to
give
effect
to
it
unless
congress
has
adopted
this
procedure
of
legislation,
and
has
set
forth
a
prologue
of
findings.
where
do
we
get
the
authority
to
tell
congress
how
to
legislate?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
cannot
presume
that
that
has
happened?
don't
we
usually
assume
that
congress
has
acted
responsibly
and
made
the
necessary
judgments,
including
the
judgment
of
whether
the
necessary
piece
of
legislation
is
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
depend
upon
how
rational
we
are,
i
suppose,
and
you
don't
want
to
press
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
under
your
theory
it
would
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
if
you're
going
to
take
the
position
that
the
federal
government
is
a
government
of
limited
powers,
it
means
a
limitation
on
doing
good
things,
as
well
as
limitations
on
doing
bad
things.
you
swallow
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
distinguish
that,
we
wouldn't
want
to
get
all
of
these
drug
possession
cases
out
of
the
federal
courts.
it
would
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
suppose
you
could
make...
there's
no
doubt
under
our
prior
cases
that
you
could
make
it
unlawful
to
sell
or
traffic
in
marijuana.
that
would
indeed
be
a
regulation
of
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
only
issue
would
be
whether
it's
interstate
or
intrastate
commerce,
and
we've
been
very
liberal
on
that,
once
commerce
is
involved.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
trafficking
in
guns,
or
trafficking
in
machine
guns
and
so
forth,
all
of
that
would
be
easily
covered.
