general
days.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
some
of
those
very
cases,
general
days,
the
statement
is
found
that
the
power
is
not
limitless.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
would
be...
if
this
case
is...
congress
can
reach
under
the
interstate
commerce
power,
what
would
be
an
example
of
a
case
which
you
couldn't
reach?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--general
days,
if
congress
proscribes
the
possession
of
guns
in
schoolyards
all
across
the
country,
it
ought
to
have
an
even
effect.
it
isn't
going
to
improve
people's
reasons
for
traveling,
is
it,
because
everyone
is
equally
affected.
you're
not
going
to...
unless
you're...
are
you
saying
that
violence
as
a
whole
will
be
cut
down
and
therefore
people
will
feel
freer
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
possession
of
a
gun
in
a
schoolyard
contributes
to
that
sort
of
violence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
days.
mr.
carter,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
for
us?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
carter.
general
days,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
the
number
93-1260,
united
states
versus
lopez.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
the
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
after
respondent,
then
a
12th-grade
student
carried
a
concealed
handgun
into
his
high
school.
he
was
charged
with
violating
the
gun-free
school
zones
act
of
1990,
which
makes
it
a
federal
offense
for
any
individual
to
knowingly
posses
a
firearm
within
a
thousand
feet
of
a
public
or
private
school.
respondent
was
convicted
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
that
conviction
because
it
concluded
that
the
gun-free
school
zones
act
was
invalid
as
beyond
congress'
power
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
constitution
creates
a
federal
government
of
enumerated
powers
and
delegates
to
congress
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
states.
our
cases
have
long
upheld
federal
regulation
of
a
wide
variety
of
commercial
activities
that
substantially
affect
interstate
commerce.
the
guns-free
school
zones
act
however
goes
further.
it
neither
regulates
a
commercial
activity,
nor
contains
a
requirement
of
the
possession
of
the
firearm
be
connected
in
anyway
to
interstate
commerce.
to
uphold
the
act
we
would
have
to
pile
inference
upon
the
inference
in
a
manner
that
would
bid
fair
to
convert
congressional
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
to
a
general
police
power
of
the
sort
retained
by
the
state.
to
do
so,
it
would
require
us
to
obliterate
the
distinction
between
what
is
truly
national
and
what
is
truly
local.
so,
this
is
something
we
are
unwilling
to
do.
we
hold
that
congress
in
enacting
the
gun-free
school
zones
act
exceeded
its
authority
under
the
commerce
clause.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
joined
by
justice
o'connor.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
in
addition,
justice
stevens,
justice
souter,
justice
ginsburg
and
i
have
filed
a
dissent.
in
our
view,
the
statute
falls
well
within
the
scope
of
the
constitution's
commerce
power.
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
we
apply
three
well-established
legal
principles.
first,
congress
can
regulate
acts
within
a
single
state
but
significantly
affect
commerce
among
the
states.
second,
in
deciding
whether
that
is
so,
the
court
must
consider
not
a
single
instance;
say
if
the
single
gun
in
a
school,
but
the
cumulative
effects
of
many
similar
instances
of
all
guns
that
are
in
or
near
schools.
third,
the
court
must
also
give
congress
considerable
leeway
that
is
to
say,
the
court
must
ask
not
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
significant
commerce
clause
connection
but
only
whether
congress
could
rationally
believe
so.
applying
these
standards,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
congress
could
believe
that
guns
in
schools
are
now
to
a
commercial
as
well
as
a
human
problem.
a
host
of
government
reports,
hearings
and
studies
set
forth
facts
that
show;
one,
that
guns
in
schools
is
a
serious
problem.
one
study
for
example
says
that
6%
of
intercity
children
carry
guns
to
school,
the
12%
have
been
shot
out
and
up
to
20%
have
been
threatened.
two,
that
school
violence
significantly
impairs
learning.
three,
that
learning,
reading,
writing,
arithmetic
has
long
accounted
for
much
of
our
nation's
economic
growth,
and
today
and
in
the
future
in
a
world
of
high
technology
and
global
economic
competition,
the
differences
between
classrooms
that
teach
and
those
that
do
no,
may
well
spell
the
difference
between
high
paying
jobs
and
unemployment
between
firms
locating
in
a
community
or
staying
away
in
a
word
between
prosperity
and
poverty.
at
the
least,
congress
could
have
a
come
to
such
a
conclusion.
it
could
have
found
guns
in
schools,
antithetical
to
a
well-educated
workforce
and
it
could
reasonably
have
believed
that
an
educated
workforce
in
today's
world
gives
a
community
the
kind
of
advantage
comparable
to
that,
given
by
location
near
a
railhead
or
harbor
in
the
past.
this
court
has
long
recognized
to
'justice
holmes',
that
commerce
is
a
practical
not
a
technical
legal
conception.
it
also
has
long
proved
willing
to
apply
preexisting
commerce
clause
law
to
changing
economic
circumstance.
that
being
so,
the
reasonableness
of
congress'
factual
beliefs
should
have
proved
sufficient
bases
for
finding
the
connection
with
interstate
commerce
that
the
constitution
requires
and
holding
he
gun-free
school
zones
act
constitutional.
such
a
holding
would
be
consistent
with
if
not
dictated
by
this
court's
prior
president.
for
these
and
other
reasons
we
dissent.
