all
right,
so
what
would
you
say
about
the
obvious
argument,
the
simple
argument
against
your
position
that
this
isn't
a
borderline
case?
the
guns
move
in
interstate
commerce,
likely,
the
books
do,
the
desks
do,
the
teachers
might.
people
will
not
move
to
places
in
this
country
where
children
are
being
killed
in
schools
by
guns,
and
in
fact,
if
the
federal
government
can't
do
something
about
it,
maybe
the
whole
economy
will
go
down
the
drain
in
1,000
obvious
ways,
all
right.
so
that
would
be
the
argument
in
wickard
&
filburn.
if
some
homegrown
wheat
affects
interstate
commerce,
which
i
guess
is
a
borderline
question
economically,
certainly
guns
in
schools
do
really,
not
borderline,
affect
commerce.
now,
what's
your
reply
to
that?
