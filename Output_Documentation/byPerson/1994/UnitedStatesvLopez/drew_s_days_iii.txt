mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
has
taken
the
extraordinary
step
of
invalidating
an
act
of
congress
as
being
beyond
its
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
the
act
in
question,
known
as
the
gun-free
school
zones
act
of
1990,
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
individual
knowingly
to
possess
a
firearm
within
a
distance
of
1,000
feet
from
the
grounds
of
an
elementary
or
secondary
school.
the
court
of
appeals
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
because
neither
the
statute
nor
its
legislative
history
contained
express
congressional
findings
identifying
the
nexus
between
interstate
commerce
and
gun
possession
in
schoolyards.
the
court
of
appeals
reached
its
erroneous
result,
in
our
estimation,
through
a
fundamental
misreading
and
misapplication
of
the
precedents
of
this
court.
first,
the
court
imposed
on
congress
a
requirement
that
it
make
judicial...
make
legislative
findings
as
to
the
nexus
between
the
activity
it
was
regulating
here
and
interstate
commerce
to
satisfy
the
court
that
it
was
exercising
that
power
in
a
constitutional
manner.
in
doing
so,
the
court
of
appeals
essentially
treated
congress
as
though
it
was
subject
to
procedural
rules
that
would
be
appropriate
in
the
context
of
a
judicial
or
administrative
proceeding,
but
not
where
congress
was
legislating
for
the
entire
nation
pursuant
to
its
plenary
powers
under
the
constitution.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
and
this
court
has
considered
and
imposed
certain
procedural
guarantees
where,
for
example,
it
felt
that
congress
was
legislating
in
a
way
that
encroached
upon
the
operations
of
state
governments,
as
in
the
case
of
new
york
v.
united
states,
where
this
court
held
that
congress
could
not
legislate
to
the
extent
it
did
to
require
that
the
states
take
title
to
certain
nuclear
waste.
it's
done
so
under
what
has
been
referred
to
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
as
the
clear
statement
rule,
or
the
plain
statement
rule,
that
where
there
are
incursions
upon
government
operations,
that
congress
has
to
make
its
intent
to
exercise
its
authority
to
the
fullest
extent
clear
in
the
legislation,
and
there
cannot
be
any
ambiguity
in
that
respect.
but
what
this
court
has
been
doing
is
looking
at,
as
it
properly
should,
limitations
on
the
exercise
of
the
commerce
clause
found
within
the
constitution
itself,
and
not
based
upon
some
generalized
concern
that
congress
was
going
too
far
in
carrying
out
that
responsibility.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
it
is,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
o'connor--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--justice
o'connor,
that
certainly
is
a
question
that
one
might
ask,
but
this
court
has
asked
that
question
in
a
number
of
other
circumstances,
and
rather
than
starting
from
the
assumption
that
something
was
inherently
local,
it's
looked
at
the
degree
to
which
congress
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
extending
its
authority
under
the
commerce
power
to
regulate
that
particular
activity.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
that
is
certainly
the
case,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
that's
an
understanding
from
the
constitution,
but
one
has
to
look
at
where
the
limitations
are
that
are
imposed
by
the
constitution
itself.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
prepared
to
speculate
generally,
but
this
court
has
found
that
congress,
for
example,
in
new
york
v.
united
states
could
not
regulate...
could
not
require
new
york
state
to
carry
out
certain
responsibilities,
because
it
was
commandeering
the
instrumentalities
of
the
state.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
don't
know
whether
there's
been
a
conscious
effort
to
do
that,
but
i
think
as
this
court
has
said
in
its
tenth
amendment
jurisprudence
that
congress
reflects
the
will
of
the
people,
and
it
has
built
into
it,
and
into
its
operations,
a
concern
about
the
extent
to
which
its
regulations
and
its
legislation
would
encroach
on
matters
that
have
been
traditionally
left
to
the
state.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
your
honor,
two--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
i
have
two--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
have
two
responses.
one,
this
court
did
decide,
in
a
case
called
preseault
v.
icc,
that
congress
could
use
its
commerce
powers
to
convert
rights
of
ways
to
recreational
uses
for
hiking
trails,
and
there
was
no
indication
that
that
particular
objective
by
congress
was
a
commercial
objective.
but
i
think
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
commerce
clause...
the
commerce
clause
has
been
viewed
as
dealing
with
three
areas,
the
channels
of
commerce
itself,
instrumentalities
of
commerce,
but
in
recent
years,
in
fact
for
many
of
the
past
couple
of
decades,
what
this
court
has
found
is
that
activities
that
affect
commerce
are
also
reachable
by
congress
under
the
commerce--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
it's
not--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--if
one
looks,
justice
scalia,
for
example,
at
the
regulation
of
firearms,
certainly
congress
was
concerned
about
the
degree
to
which
transfer
or
possession
in
some
instances
affected
interstate
commerce,
but
i
think
it
also
recognized
that
having
a
gun
in
and
of
itself
is
not
interstate
commerce,
it's
the
impact
of
certain
activity
on
interstate
commerce.
for
example,
the
rules
that
limit
the
types
of
persons
who
can
possess
firearms,
it's
not
suggesting
that
that
particular
regulation--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--has
to
do
with
interstate
commerce.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
don't
believe
that
the
issue
has
been
clearly
presented,
justice
scalia,
but
i
think
that
what
this
court
has
operated
upon
as
an
initial
assumption
is
that
congress
was
given
the
power
under
the
constitution
to
legislate
directly
upon
private
individuals,
and
that
there
are
no
built-in
limitations
on
the
constitution.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
answer
is
that
it
may
be
possible
for
congress
to
do
that
under
the
commerce
power.
again,
one
would
have
to
look
at
was
congress
legislating
rationally,
with
a
rational
basis
for
thinking
that
regulating
violence
would
have
an
impact
on
interstate
commerce,
would
have...
would
be
the
type
of
activity
that
affected
instate
commerce?
but
what
we
have
in
this
particular
act
is
not
that
bold
assertion
by
congress.
what
we
have
is,
first
of
all,
enough
evidence
to
meet
the
test
that
this
court
has
set
that
congress
had
a
rational
basis
for
thinking
that
gun
possession
on
or
near
school
grounds
affected
interstate
commerce.
one
was
the
relationship
between
violence
itself
and
the
economic
activity
of
the
country.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
violence
in
certain
parts
of
the
country,
it
makes
it
difficult
for
institutions
to
function.
there
is
the
insurance
consequence.
where
violence
occurs,
insurance
burdens
are
shared
by
the
entire
country,
not
just
by
the
locale
where
this
particular
violence
occurs.
it
interferes
in
the
same
way
that
this
court
found
in
heart
of
atlanta
motel
with
respect
to
the
travel
of
persons
in
the
face
of
segregation
in
places
of
public
accommodations.
it
interferes
with
the
willingness
of
people
to
travel
to
certain
parts
of
the
country--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
that's
certainly
one
of
the
concerns
that's
been
expressed,
but
i
think
that
this
court
has
readily
available
to
it
a
way
of
analyzing
that,
and
that
in
reading
new
york
v.
united
states,
one
would
have
to
be
concerned
whether
this
particular
activity
was
imposing
statutory
requirements
on
the
state,
or--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--making
local
governments
assume
responsibility.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
certainly--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--certainly,
pursuant
to
the
spending
power,
congress
could
provide
that
type
of
support,
but
i
think
it
would
raise
questions
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
as
to
whether
congress
was
in
fact
taking
over
something
that
was
clearly
part
of
the
state
responsibility.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
do
not--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
correct.
as
long
as
congress
is
dealing
with
the
conduct
of
individuals--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--and
where
there
is
this
affecting
interstate
commerce
nexus,
then
congress
should
be
permitted
to
do
that,
allowed
to
do
that
under
the
constitution.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
i
think
that's
a
reasonable
assumption
to
think
that
congress
could
have
held
or
relied
upon
in
enacting
this
statute.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
think,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that
it
is
an
easy
step
from
possession
to
use
and,
therefore,
the
fact
that
congress
might
be
concerned
with
possession
doesn't
mean
that
it
wasn't
concerned
about
use.
and
there
also
is
sufficient
evidence
in
the
consideration
of
even
the
gun-free
school
zones
act
that
there
was
heightened
violence
on
school
property
by
juveniles,
and
if
one
looks
at
the
findings
and
records
with
respect
to
earlier
legislation...
for
example,
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968...
congress
makes
specific
findings
between
the
easy
availability
of
firearms
and
the
level
of
juvenile
and
youthful
violence
and
criminality.
so
that
the
connection
between
possession
of
firearms
on
or
near
schoolyards
and
violence
and
the
regulation
of
that
possession
are
relationships
that
congress
has
considered
in
the
past,
and
in
our
estimation
made
perfectly
good
sense
under
the
gun-free
school
zones
act.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
scalia,
congress
has
legislated,
for
example,
with
respect
to
problems
of--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--domestic
violence,
or
the
disappearance
of
children--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--or
interstate
divorce
problems,
so
it's
not
that
congress
hasn't
dealt
with
those
issues,
but
i
think
we
would
look
to
the--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--justice
scalia,
that
is
really
your
department,
but
let
me
say
that--
[laughter]
that
one
would
look
to--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--the
answer
is
that
one
would
have
to
look
to
the
constitution
itself,
and
try
to
identify
where
there
are
any
limitations--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--and
one
would
assume,
for
example,
that
privacy
would
be
one
of
the
considerations.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
i'm
not
intending
to
make
that
distinction
as
a
major
point.
certainly,
there's
a
difference
between
the
two
approaches,
and--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
i
do.
i
think
that,
based
upon
its
interstate
commerce
power,
it
could
determine
that
what
the
state
had
done
interfered
with
the
free
flow
of
commerce,
affected
commerce
in
a
negative
way,
and
therefore
had
to
be
dealt
with,
but
getting
back
to--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
i
think
there
are
limits,
justice
souter.
the
question
is
whether
there's
anything
left
of
the
state
once
the
federal
government
gets
done.
if
what
the
federal
government
is
doing
is
essentially
destroying
the
delicate
balance
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states
in
ways
that
this
court
has
not
indicated
the
constitution
contemplated,
then
that
would
be
difficult.
i
think
there
would
be
limitations
on
that
ability.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
think
there
is
a
recognizable
limit,
but
that
is
the
situation
where
i
think
this
court
has
indicated
that
congress
could
not
go,
but
the
gun-free
school
zones
act
does
not
have
any
preemption.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i'm
not
saying
that.
i
think
that--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
in
garcia
what
this
court
indicated
was
that
the
protection
of
this
balance,
insofar
as
the
tenth
amendment
is
concerned,
really
does
reside
with
the
political
process
and
in
congress.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it's
not
an
argument
that
i
concocted,
justice
kennedy.
it's
one
that
i
think
flows
from
this
court's
decisions,
and
that
one
does...
as
i
indicated
to
justice
o'connor,
one
doesn't
start
the
analysis
by
saying
there
are
things
that
are
clearly
local
and
within
local
control
that
congress
cannot
reach.
the
analysis
has
to
be
whether
one
can
identify
a
rational
basis
for
congress'
wanting
to
extend
its
commerce
power
into
a
particular
area.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
don't
believe
it
is,
because
as
i
was
indicating,
that
this
court
has
identified
there
are
limits
within
the
constitution.
there
are
the--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
we
have
to
remember
that
the
commerce
power
is
one
of
the
heads
of
authority
under
the
constitution
that
transformed
our
country
from
an
agrarian
society
to
one
that--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--was
a
powerful
commercial
enterprise.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
your
honor--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--your
honor,
we're
talking
about
commercial
activity.
we
are
talking
about
something
that
affects
interstate
commerce.
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
congress
has
been
concerned
long
before
1990
with
the
impact
of
diminished
achievement
in
primary
and
secondary
schools
and
this
country's
ability
to
compete
and
to
have
a
strong
economy.
this
is
not
about
just
regulating
guns--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--possession.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
in
that
regard,
yes,
it
has
given
money,
but
it
indicates
congress'
concern
with
this
impact
on
the
national
economy.
once,
it
seems
to
me,
that's
identified,
it's
identified
as
having
an
impact
on
interstate
commerce,
that,
then,
opens
the
way
for
congress
to
regulate
directly
through
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
am
absolutely
not
saying
that.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i'm
perhaps
left
to
repeat
myself
in
some
respects.
this
court
has
never
said
that
there
are
absolute
limits
to
the
exercise
of
the
commerce
power.
it's
looked
at
individual
cases
and
tried
to
determine,
exercising--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
don't
have--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--the
court
has
never
looked
at
this
in
the
abstract.
it's
not
an
abstract
process.
it's
been
viewed
by
the
court
as
an
empirical
process.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
there
are...
excuse
me.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
your
honor--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
i'm
not
arguing
that
it's
a
political
question.
indeed,
one
of
the
elements
of
the
political
question
doctrine
is
that
there
are
not
available
judicial
tools
for
evaluating
what
is
at
issue.
i
think
this
court
has
identified
in
a
number
of
cases
the
fact
that
there
are
limits
within
the
constitution
that
can
be
applied
by
this
court
to
control
the
extent
to
which
congress
operates
under
the
commerce
power.
the
fact
that
this
court
has
not
found
the
need
to
rein
in
congress
is
simply
an
indication
that
congress
is
legislating
in
a
way
that's
consistent
and
rational--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--in
light
of
the
growth
of
this
country.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
it
was
abdicating
its
responsibility
in
that
regard.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
stevens,
we're
not
relying
on
them
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word,
but
we
think
that
at
a
very
minimum
they
indicate
that
reasons
can
be
identified
for
why
congress
wanted
to
regulate
this
particular
activity,
so
that
it's
corroborative
of
what
we
were
saying
our
briefs,
and
what
we
think
this
court
should
properly
find
about
the
bases
that
congress
relied
upon
in
legislating
it
as
it
did,
or
could
rely
upon.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals,
based
upon
just
the
reading
of
the
decision,
would
have
come
out
the
same
way,
but
i
can't
be
absolutely
certain.
what
the
court
did
was
impose
a
number
of
procedural
requirements
on
congress,
and
i'm
not
certain
how
it
would
view
these
particular
findings,
whether
they
had
been
promulgated
in
a
way
that
touched
every
base
that
the
court
of
appeals
felt
was
necessary.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.

mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
waive
my
rebuttal.
