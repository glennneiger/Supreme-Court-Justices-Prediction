justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we
were
concerned
that
the
original
understandings
and
structural
theories
that
underlay
the
federal
system
have
been
so
eroded
that
that
whole
system
is
in
danger,
i
take
it
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
us
to
consider
some
procedural
guarantees.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
objection
there
was
that
it
was
objecting
the
state
governmental
machinery
to
operate
in
a
certain
way.
the
question
here,
it
seems
to
me,
is
quite
different.
the
question
here
is
the
universe
of
transactions
that
the
congress
may
reach.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me,
mr.
days,
has
there
been
anything
in
our
recent
history
in
the
last
20
years
where
it
appears
that
congress
made
a
considered
judgment
that
it
could
not
reach
a
particular
subject?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
we
left
with
the
proposition,
then,
that
it
is
for
congress,
not
the
court,
to
preserve
the
federal
structure?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
with
reference
to
the
commerce
point,
realistically,
that's
where
we
are.
none
of
us
at
least
can
think
of
anything
under
our
present
case
law,
or
at
least
under
your
argument,
that
congress
can't
do
if
it
chooses
under
the
commerce
clause,
so
if
the
federal
system
must
be
preserve
by
someone,
and
the
commerce
clause
is
a
means
by
which
the
federal
structure
can
be
obliterated,
and
if
we
have
no
tools
or
analytic
techniques
to
make
these
distinctions,
then
it
follows
that
the
federal
balance
is
remitted
to
the
political
judgment
of
the
congress.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
that's
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
argument
that
you're
making
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
my
point
is,
mr.
days,
maybe
the
constitutional
system
would
be
better
served
if
we
recognize
that
there
are
no
judicial
tools
to
do
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
no
judicial
tools
to
put
meaningful
limits
on
the
commerce
clause.
therefore,
it's
essentially
a
political
question,
therefore,
the
obligation
to
protect
the
federal
system
is
that
of
the
congress,
and
therefore
we
have
to
ensure
that
there's
some
mechanics
or
procedures
that
they
mus
follow
to
do
so--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--especially
if
there
is
an
indication
that
this
is
never
an
explicit
subject
of
concern.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
am
aware
of
at
least
two
schools
within
1,000
feet
of
an
interstate
highway.
i
am
sure
there
are
many
schools
in
the
united
states
that
are
within
1,000
feet
of
an
interstate
highway,
or
of
a
heavily
traveled
artery.
don't
you
think
that's
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
a
state
tried
to
pass
this
identical
statute,
would
that
not
be,
then,
an
interference
with
interstate
commerce
beyond
the
authority
of
the
states
to
enact?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
that
is
so,
under
the
vacuum
theory,
then
the
federal
government
necessarily
would
have
the
power
to
enact
this
same
law,
lest
there
be
a
vacuum.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
there
would
be
an
interference,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
congress
make
it
a
crime
to
throw
a
fire
bomb
into
a
schoolhouse?
