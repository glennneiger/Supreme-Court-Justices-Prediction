justice
david
h.
souter
--where
there
is
violence
present.
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
test
a
different
way
of
reading
the
congressional
rationale?
what
if
congress
had
said,
as
part
of
its
thought
process
expressed
in
the
amendment,
that
the
states,
for
whatever
reason,
violence,
or
whatever
reason,
had
simply
proven
incapable
of
providing
sufficient
education
in
math
and
technology,
that
in
the
long
run
was
a
threat
to
commercial
activity,
and
as
a
response
to
that,
congress
was,
in
fact,
going
to
nationalize
the
schools,
and
it
in
effect
would
provide
a
federal
public
school
education
for
every
child
from
kindergarten
on
up?
would
that
be
justifiable
under
the
commerce
clause?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
relieving
the
state--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it's
relieving
the
state
of
a
burden,
saying
you
don't
have
to
pay
for
this
any
more.
we'll
take
care
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
there
is
no
question
that
congress
has
the
power,
in
effect,
to
take
over
crime,
because
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--presume
there's
no
limitation
on
your
rationale,
or
on
congress'
rationale,
that
would
preclude
it
from
reaching
any
traditional
criminal
activity.
justice
david
h.
souter
general
days,
i
think
it's
well-established
that
a
factor
in
both
the
education
of
children
and
in
the
law-abiding
nature
of
children,
a
major
factor
is
the
stability
of
families.
i
suppose,
under
your
reasoning,
congress
could
enact
a
federal
domestic
relations
law
providing
a
federal
marriage,
federal
divorce
procedures,
and
what-not.
i
mean,
there's
nothing
that
affects
levels
of
crime
and
levels
of
education
as
much
as
that.
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
limitation,
then,
that
you're
recognizing,
is
the
narrow
reading...
well,
strike
narrow,
is
a
reading
of
u.s.
v.
new
york
that
congress
could
not
impose
certain
affirmative
obligations
upon
the
state,
but
so
far
as
concurrent
regulation,
and,
indeed,
even
displacement
of
state
regulation,
presumably
there
is
no
limit,
if,
in
fact,
it
can
reach
the
case
before
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
my
question,
and
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying
that
the
only
instance
in
which
we
can
clearly
say
that
the
delicate
balance
would
be
destroyed
is
the
instance
in
which
the
national
government
imposes
affirmative
obligations
on
the
states,
e.g.,
making
them
the
owners
of
nuclear
waste
and
so
on,
and
that
short
of
that,
there
apparently
isn't
any
recognizable
limit.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
one
always
can.
i
mean,
there
is
no
limit.
benjamin
franklin
said,
it
is
so
wonderful
to
be
a
rational
animal,
that
there
is
a
reason
for
everything
that
one
does.
[laughter]
and
if
that's
the
test,
it's
all
over.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
has
acted--
justice
david
h.
souter
--simply
under
the
spending
power
up
to
this
point,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
hasn't
it
acted
simply
under
the
spending
power?
it
has
given
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
or
an
indication--
justice
david
h.
souter
--of
what
justice
kennedy
said.
i
mean,
the
cases
can
be
read
equally
consistently
with
justice
kennedy's
suggestion
that
there
simply
is
no
judicial
way
to
do
this
job.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
difference
in
certainty
the
reason
why
you
draw
a
line,
as
i
understand
that
you
do,
between
this
statute
and
a
statute
in
which
congress,
presumably
without
any
findings,
simply
criminalized
the
discharge
of
handguns
in
a
school?
we
would
know,
in
the
latter
case,
that
congress
had
understood
and
had
adverted
to
the
likely
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
whereas
here
we
don't?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean,
if
congress
simply,
without
findings,
said
discharges
are
criminalized,
there
would
be
a
patent
rational
relationship
there
to
interstate
commerce,
whereas
there
is
not
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
your
answer...
if
i
push
you
to
the
wall,
is
your
answer
going
to
be
that
the
discharge
statute
would
also
be
unconstitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--assume
two
cases.
you've
got
a
discharge
statute
without
findings.
unconstitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
in...
within
1,000
feet
of
a
school.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
same
statute,
findings
identical
to
the
ones
here,
discharges
within
1,000
feet
of
the
schools
threaten
the
educational
mission,
the
educational
mission,
the
threat
to
the
educational
mission
will
deteriorate
education
and
ultimately
that
will
affect
commerce,
because
we
will
have
a
dumb
population.
is
that
constitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
rational
enough?
