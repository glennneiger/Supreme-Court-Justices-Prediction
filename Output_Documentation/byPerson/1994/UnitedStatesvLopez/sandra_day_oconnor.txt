well,
let's
do
exactly
that,
and
ask
whether
the
simple
possession
of
something
at
or
near
a
school
is
commerce
at
all.
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
that
it
wasn't,
and
i
would
have
thought
that
it,
moreover,
is
not
interstate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
this
is
covered,
what's
left
of
enumerated
powers?
what
is
there
that
congress
could
not
do,
under
this
rubric,
if
you
are
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
there
ought
to
be
limits
within
the
commerce
clause
itself.
these
are
powers
expressly
delegated
to
the
congress
under
a
constitutional
scheme
that
envisions
that
congress
has
certain
enumerated
powers
and
that's
it,
and
if
the
function
being
regulated
is
wholly
intrastate,
and
is
not
commercial,
it
is
very
hard
for
me
to
understand
why
it's
within
the
text
of
the
interstate
commerce
clause
power.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
rightly
so,
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
it
can
clearly
deal
with
commercial
activity.
we've
been
very
generous
about
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
interstate
activity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
your
position?
if
those
findings
in
the
recent
findings
had
been
there
at
the
time
that
this
statute
was
enacted,
is
it
valid
or
invalid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
you
answer
the
question,
though?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
valid
or
invalid,
under
your
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
it
isn't
interstate
and
isn't
commercial,
that's
fine,
just
so
long
as
they
add
a
string
of
rationales
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
wanted
to
know
what
argument
you
were
making.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
that
was
commercial
activity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
a
general
ban
on
certain
types
of
assault
weapons?
just
possession--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
certain
types
of
weapons.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
possess
with
intent
to
distribute.
