mr.
gerald
r.
grant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
arizona
supreme
court
held
that
where
a
police
officer
arrested
respondent
based
on
a
police
computer
report
of
an
outstanding
misdemeanor
arrest
warrant,
where
that
warrant
had
actually
been
quashed
prior
to
the
arrest,
that
the
exclusionary
rule
required
suppression
of
the
evidence
seized
pursuant
to
that
arrest,
regardless
of
whether
the
error
that
resulted
in
the
warrant's
continued
presence
in
the
computer
system
was
the
responsibility
of
judicial
personnel
or
police
personnel.
it's
the
state's
position
that
this
holding
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decisions
in
leon,
massachusetts
v.
sheppard,
and
krull,
and
the
state
of
arizona
asks
this
court
to
reverse
the
arizona
supreme
court's
judgment.
before
i
get
into
what
i
have
stated
is
the
main
argument--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--no,
i
don't
take
that
position,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
we
had
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
the
defense
position
at
that
hearing
essentially
was
that
it
made
no
difference
whether
the
error
was
judicial
or
police.
the
defense
developed
no--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--the
trial
judge--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--did
not.
i
believe
a
fair
reading
of
the...
of
the
ruling
is
that
he
was
willing
to
assume
that
the
error
was
judicial
rather
than
police,
but
he
made
no
specific
factual
finding.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
believe
it
would
be
a
different
case,
yes.
i
believe
in
that
sort
of
situation
you'd
be
getting
away
from
what
i
think
is
the
clear
issue
here,
that
the
error
was
the
result
of
judicial
personnel,
not
police
personnel.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
well,
i
think
the
evidence
is
clear
that
that's...
that's
why
the
warrant
was
still
in
the
computer
system
here.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
think...
i
think
the...
i'm
drawing
a
blank
on
the
name
of
the
case
for
the
moment,
but
i
do
not...
i
think
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
under
leon,
because
in
whiting,
i...
or
whiteley,
what
the
officer
presented
to
the
judge
in
order
to
obtain
the
warrant
was
simply
a
bare
bones
affidavit,
and
in
leon
this
court
noted
that
that
sort
of
situation
would
not
be
the
sort
that
would
be
justifiable
for
the
good
faith
exclusion
to
the...
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
i
also
think
there's
a
distinction
between
whiteley
and
this...
in
this
case,
and
i
think
it's
followed
through
in
leon,
in
that
what
the
court
should
look
at,
in
whiteley
you
looked
at...
the
warrant
began
with
an
officer
instigating
it.
he
went
to
the
judge
and
obtained
the
warrant
based
on
a
good
faith...
excuse
me,
based
on
a
bare
bones
affidavit,
which
leon
has
said
is
something
that
the
court
will
not
recognize
and
not
allow
the
officers
to
rule
on.
here,
the
warrant
was
initiated
by
a
justice
court.
the
justice
court
issued
this
arrest
warrant
when
mr.
evans
failed
to
appear
before
the
justice
court.
the
justice
court
put
the
warrant
into
the
police
system
for
the
purpose
of
getting
police
assistance
and
arresting
mr.
evans
and
bringing
him
before
the
court,
and
it
was
the
justice
court's
failure,
i
think
that's
clear
from
the
record,
to
make
the
call
to
the
sheriff's
office
and
have
that
warrant
removed
once
it
was
quashed,
that
is
to
blame
for
mr.
evans'
arrest.
in
that
situation,
i
think
the
good
faith
exception
does
not
require...
the
good
faith
exception
applies,
and
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
be
applied
to
suppress
the
evidence.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
would
disagree
that
this
court
ought
to
fashion
a
rule
that
the
police
ought
to
be
strictly
responsible.
i
think
the
risk
issue
is
something
this
court
could
consider,
what
sort
of
procedures
do
the
police
have
in
place
to
audit
them.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
think
in
a
case
unlike
this,
where
i
think
the
error
is
clearly
based
on
judicial
error,
not
police
error,
i
think
that
what
the
court
ought
to
look
at
is
the
objective
reasonableness
of
the
arresting
officers...
of
the
arresting
officers
and
whether--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
don't...
i
think
that
goes
beyond
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
said,
and
i
think
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
said
is
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
has
said
in
its
recent
decisions
over
the
last
several
years
interpreting
the
exclusionary
rule,
which
is,
it
doesn't
apply
whenever
there's
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
it
only
applies
when
the
purpose
of
it
is
most
effectively
served.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
that
may
well
be
a
powerful
deterrent.
i
don't
think
it's
a
reasonable
deterrent
in
this
case,
however.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
they
didn't
involve
computers,
but
yes,
computers
were
available.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
well,
i
think
that
goes
a
little
beyond
my
position.
i
think
my
basic
position
is,
where
the
error
is
the
result--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--of
judicial
personnel,
not
police
personnel.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
if
the--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
think
if
you
get
beyond
the
situation
we
have
in
this
case,
i
think
what
the
court
ought
to
focus
on
is
the
arresting
officer
and
any
other
officers
involved
in
the
investigative
team,
for
lack
of
a
better
word.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
think...
i
think
the
deterrence...
if
you
look
at
what
happened
in
this
case,
an
officer
was
presented
with
a
situation
where
he
witnesses
one
violation
of
a
traffic
law.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
he
then
had
a
person
who
admitted
a
second
violation
of
a
class
1
misdemeanor.
he
then
went
to
a
police
computer
and
obtained
confirmation
of
that
violation
of
the
class
1
misdemeanor,
and
also
obtained
information
showing
that
there
was
an
outstanding
misdemeanor
arrest
for
his
warrant.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
agree,
and
i
think
his
conduct--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--well,
i
think
the
distinction
i
draw
here
between
judicial
and
police
is
that
it's...
there's
no
need
to
go
beyond
that
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
if
the
court
wanted
to
go
beyond
that,
i
think
the
distinction
ought
to
lie
with...
where
the
court
ought
to
draw
the
line
is
with
the
investigating
officers
and
any
other
officers
involved
in
the
investigative
team.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
don't--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--true.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
no,
i'm
not.
i
think
what
i'm
saying
is
consistent
with
hensley.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
think
in
hensley
the
court
was
faced
with
a
situation
where
the
officer
who
made
the
stop
did
not
have
the
personal
knowledge,
which
is
similar
to
this
case.
what
the
court
then
looked
at
in
hensley
was
the
instigating
officer,
the
officer
who
had
the
knowledge,
and
if
he...
if
the
knowledge
he
had
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
stop,
then
the
stop
by
the
arresting
officer
was
good.
in
this
case,
you
have
an
arresting
officer
who
had
no
knowledge.
you
don't
have
an
instigating
officer.
the
instigating
event
came
from
a
judicial--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
agree--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
agree
they
have
some
responsibility,
yes.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
in
this
case,
no,
i
would
not
lose
my
case.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
think
that's
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
said,
and
i
think
that's
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
said
in
leon
and
other
cases,
that
there
are--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--because
i
don't
think
applying
that
broad
brush
with
the
exclusionary
rule
is
going
to
change
reasonable
actions
by
officers
in
the
street.
this
officer
essentially
had
no
choice
but
to
do--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--other
than
what
he
did.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
don't
think
whiteley
and
hensley
go
as
broad
as
your
honor
is
drawing
them.
i
think
whiteley
and
hensley
can
be
more
narrowly
drawn
to
focus
on
the
arresting
officer
and
anyone
involved
in
the
investigation.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
yes.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
yes.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
because,
as
this
court
has
said,
the
exclusionary
rule
exists
to
deter
police
misconduct.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
think,
first
of
all,
we're
beyond
far
what
the
facts
of
this
case
are,
but
i
think
if
what
you
want
to
deter
is
officers
acting
unreasonably,
you're
not
going
to
accomplish
that
by--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
don't
think
arizona
could
go
beyond
what
this
court
has
said,
which
is
i
feel
what
they
have
in
this....
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
think
it...
i
do
not
think
it's
wise
to
go
beyond
it.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
think
the--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--exclusionary
rule
is
a
narrow--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--procedural
remedy--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
think--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
agree
the
weighing
process,
the
farther
away...
the
weighing
process
that
is
engaged
in
between
deterrence--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--yes.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
agree.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
well,
i
think--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
think
the
system
here,
if
you
look
at
what
actually
happened
in
this
case,
once
the
system,
in
this
case
the
justice
court
personnel,
found
out
that
there
was
a
problem
with
the
warrant,
that
mr.
evans
had
been
arrested
pursuant
to
a
warrant
that
had
been
quashed,
the
justice
court
personnel
immediately
took
steps
to
remedy
it.
they
called
the
police
department,
told
them
that
the
warrant
had
been
quashed
and
that
he
should
no
longer
be
held
pursuant
to
it,
and
they
then
searched
their
own
system
through
all
the
cases
that
were
handled
on
that
same
day
as
mr.
evans,
and
found
out
that
there
were
three
other
cases
where
warrants
had
been
quashed
by
that
same--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--well,
i
think...
i
think
what
the
evidence
in
this--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--no,
i
think
my...
i
think
my
view
shows
is
the
deterrent,
and
based
on
the
record
in
this
case,
is
that
the
deterrence
of
the
sort
of
personnel
involved
here
is
not
necessary.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
justice
court
personnel
are
not--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--well--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i'm--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--correct.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
well,
i'm
not
saying
it's
not
necessary.
i'm
saying
that--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--the
effectiveness
of
it
becomes
less
the
further
away
you
move
from
the
arresting
officer
and
the
people
involved
in
the
investigative
team,
and
in
those
cases
the
balancing
that
is
required,
the
cost
that
is
incurred
by
suppressing
relevant
and
reliable
evidence,
becomes
greater,
and
the
deterrence
value
becomes
less.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
think
that's
plausible.
i
think
the
evidence
in
this
case
strongly
supports
the
finding
that
there
was
a
judicial
error
here
and
not
a
police
error.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
that's
possible,
yes.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
well,
i
think
i...
i
think
i
have
addressed
that
in
part
of
the
answers
to
the
questions.
i
think
what...
if
we
get
beyond
the
issue
of
judicial
error,
i
think
where
the
line
ought
to
be
drawn
is
with
the
arresting
officers
and
anyone
else
involved
in
the
particular
investigation
that
led
to
the
arrest--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--and
here
you
don't
have
that.
you
have...
it
was
initiated
by
a
justice
court--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
don't
think
that
sort
of
involvement
suffices
to
justify
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
i
think
that
is
too
far
removed--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--from
the
strong
deterrence
value
of
the
actual
arresting
officer
and
those
closely
involved
in
the
investigation.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
well,
i
think
it
goes
back...
first
of
all,
hensley,
we
didn't
get
to
an
exclusionary
determination
because
there
was
no
finding
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation
in
hensley,
and
what
hensley
did
was
go
back
to
the
initiating
officer,
the
officer
who
felt
there
was
reason
to
stop
the
defendant,
and
examined
what
he
knew,
the
officer
who
started
the
whole
procedure
by
asking...
by
putting
the
flier,
the
stop
flier
into
the
system.
here
you
don't
have
that.
it
was
started
by
a
justice
court,
and
the
justice
court
was
responsible
for
its
continued
presence
in
the
system
after
it
had
been
quashed.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
as
far--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
think
the
need
to
keep
information
current,
and
correct,
is
demonstrated
in
this
case
by
what
the
justice
court
personnel
did
when
they
found
out
about
the
error.
they
took
care
of
it,
and
they
found
that
there
were
other
errors,
and
they
took
care
of
those
as
well.
i
don't
think
that
that
justifies
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
those
sort
of
people.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
the
justice
court
personnel
took
the...
well,
the
arizona
supreme
court
had
not
made
its
ruling
when
the
justice
court
employees
did
their
job.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
they
did
it
because
of
their
professional
responsibilities
as
part
of
the
judicial
system
to
make
sure
that
the
system
they...
the
information
they
put
into
the
police
computer
system
was
accurate
as
possible.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
correct.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
yes.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
well,
i
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
opinion
as
saying
leon
is
not
helpful.
i
think
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
simply
said
was,
leon
doesn't
apply
because
that
was
a
case
where
an
officer
obtained
a
warrant,
and
here
there
was
an
invalid
warrant.
i
think
they
simply
distinguished
leon
on
that
basis
and
then
went
on
to
say
that--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
don't...
i
don't
think
leon
is
limited
in
the
manner
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
suggested,
that
it
was
limited
to
searches
with
warrants
authorized
by
a
judge.
illinois
v.
krull
by
this
court
demonstrated
that
that
wasn't
the
case.
it
wasn't
limited
to
warrants
authorized
by
judges.
it
extended
the
good
faith
rule
adopted
in
leon
to
warrantless
searches
authorized
by
a
statute,
and
i
think
when
the
arizona...
the
arizona's
supreme
court's
attempt
to
distinguish
leon
by
saying
that
it
simply
involved
a
warrant
and
this
didn't
doesn't
hold
up.
i
think
this
court
is...
this
case
is
consistent--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
don't
think--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
don't
think
this
situation
is
as
far
removed
from
leon
as
that.
i
think
leon
analysis
regarding
the
particular
deterrent
effects
of
the
exclusionary
rule
on
other
than
police
actors
is
still
valid.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
yes.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
they
were...
the
arrest
was
on
january
5th.
on
january
7th,
the...
and
the
trial
court's
order
wasn't
until
april.
on
january
7th,
the
justice
court
personnel
learned
of
the
error,
and
on
january
7th
they
took
care
of
it
and
also
did
the
additional
investigation
to
find
three
other
cases
that
same
day--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--that
had
not
been
quashed...
that
had
not
been
removed
from
the
system,
excuse
me.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
it
was
that
they
took...
well,
first
of
all,
they
took
the
curative
action
of
calling
the
police
department,
or
the
sheriff's
office,
and
telling
them
to
remove
that
warrant
from
the
system,
and
also
to
release
any
hold
on
mr.
evans
based
on
that
warrant.
the
additional
step
they
took
was,
they
went
back
and
examined
the
files
that
had
been
handled
by
this
pro
tem
justice
of
the
peace
on
that
day--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--yes.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
no,
there
were
no
other--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--no.
there's
no
evidence
that
anything
else
was
done.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
yes.
