justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
make
of
the
argument
which
is
suggested
at...
toward
the
end
of
the
respondent's
brief,
based
upon,
in
effect
the
peculiar
risks
that
computers
bring...
i
think
the
argument
essentially
runs
that
because
of
the
great
currency
which
computerized
information
has,
the
risk
of
crime
is
greater
than
it
used
to
be
when
we
were
just
dealing
with
pieces
of
paper
in
local
police
departments?
the
police
have
chosen
to
use
computers.
why
shouldn't
we
recognize
the
risk
involved
in
using
them
by
saying
that
if
you
choose
to
use
them,
you
are
going
to
be
strictly
responsible
for
the
accuracy
of
the
information
in
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
we...
how
do
we
translate
the
consideration
of
that
risk
into
a
practical
rule?
what
do
you
think
would
be
an
appropriate
rule
that
would
reflect
that
risk?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
maybe
they
were
right
and
we
were
wrong.
i
mean,
this
case
is
dealing
specifically
with
the
problems
of
computers
and
our
prior
cases
were
not,
and
i
think
as
justice
ginsburg
has
suggested,
the
point
was
that
the
deterrence
factor
is
being,
at
least
in
arizona,
tailored
to
what
it
sees
to
be
the
problem,
and
it's
a
problem
that
cannot
be
limited
just
to
police
departments,
it's
a
problem
of
the
governmental
system.
why
isn't
that
a
better
view
than
the
view
that
may
have
been
implicit
in
leon?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
you're
right
back--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
the
problem
that
you
admit
that
your
rule
cannot
be
that
narrow.
you...
at
least
i
assume
you
do,
because
if
you
don't
do
that,
then
it
seems
to
me
you're
going
to
have
to
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet.
and
if
we
were
going
to
say
the
only
person
to
whom
we
look
is
the
officer
in
the
street,
then
i
would
suppose
on
the
legality
of
a
warrantless
arrest
and
the
lawfulness
of
a
warrantless
search,
and
so
on,
we
would
not
look
beyond
what
happened
to
be
in
the
mind
of
the
officer
who
made
the
search.
so
if
we're
going
to
have
a
broad
rule
that
we
impute
all
knowledge
of
the
police
to
all
members
of
the
department
in
your
benefit,
then
i
suppose
you've
got
to
take
the
same...
the
burden
of
that
same
rule,
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
in
any
event,
leaving
the
question
of
where
the
line
is
drawn,
you
accept
the
view
that
the
mind
of
someone
other
than
the
one
officer
doing
the
search
or
making
the
arrest
may
be
relevant
to
the
determination
of
what
is
reasonable.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
accept
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then
why
do
we
draw
the
line
between
the
police
on
the
one
hand
and
the
larger
government
on
the
other?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
realize
that,
but
the
arizona
argument
said
there's
somebody
else
whom
you'd
better
deter,
because
if
you
don't
include
the
government
more
broadly
within
your
deterrent
objective,
you
have
no
way,
as
a
practical
matter,
of
inducing
care
in
the
use
of
these
computers.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
the...
that
is
the
very
denial
of
the
premise
upon
which
i
think
arizona
was
arguing.
arizona
was
saying,
we
want
to
deter
more
than
the
officer,
because
if
we
don't
do
that,
there's
never
going
to
be
an
effective
way
of
deterring
inaccuracy
in
computers.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
this
court
perhaps
can,
and
why
shouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
it
be
kept
that
way?
why
should
we
not
consider
it
relevant
that
the
system
maintains
computers
and
therefore
a
deterrent
rule,
which
is
meant
to
make
computer
information
accurate,
should
consider
the
entire
system
and
not
just
the
police?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is...
i
guess
i'm
not
clear
on
one
thing.
the
answer
that
justice
scalia
gave
for
you
said,
it's
not
effective,
and
now
you're
saying
it's
not
even
necessary.
which
is
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry,
i
thought
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask--
justice
david
h.
souter
--just
one
question?
if
we
were
to
take
the
position
that
i
guess
the
arizona
supreme
court
took
and
say
that
it
is
simply
the
system's
responsibility
here,
and
therefore
we
don't
care
where
the
error
is
made,
there's
going
to
be
suppression,
because
we
want
to
induce
the
system
to
get
it
right,
why
shouldn't
we
take
exactly
the
same
position
in
a
leon
situation?
in
a
leon
situation,
in
effect,
we
are
saying,
well,
the
judge
may
have
gotten
it
wrong,
but
as
long
as
the
police
reasonably
relied,
we
will
in
effect
allow
the
evidence
in.
why
shouldn't
we,
if
we
accept
arizona's
position,
in
a
leon
situation
say,
look,
we
don't
care
that
it's
the
judge
who
made
the
mistake,
we
want
to
induce
the
system
to
get
judges
who
will
be
smart
enough
to
get
it
right.
if
we
take
your
position,
don't
we
have
to
overrule
leon?
