they
were
available,
but
not
as
widely
used.
but
let
me
ask
you
this:
your
test
is
the
objective
reasonableness
of
the
arresting
officer's
conduct,
as
i
understand
it
and,
therefore,
if
the
officer
reasonably
believed
there
was
an
outstanding
warrant,
the
arrest
is
okay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
if--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you
describe
it
broadly,
as
i
did,
you
would
have
to
agree
it
would
really
not
matter
whether
the
error
was
committed
by
a
police
officer
in
the
home
office
or
by
a
judicial
officer
in
the
home
office--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
in
either
case
the
officer
acted
reasonably.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
don't
acknowledge
that
there's
any
reason...
if
the
deterrence
focuses
on
the
arresting
officer,
there's
no
difference
between
the
cases,
and
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
deterrence
focuses
on
trying
to
be
sure
people
keep
their
records
up
to
date,
again
there's
no
difference
between
the
two
cases.
why
should
we
draw
a
difference
between
a
judicial
mistake
of
this
kind
an
executive
mistake
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
his
information
would
be
exactly
the
same
whether
the
misinformation
about
the
warrant,
regardless
of
who
was
responsible
for
that
misin--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well
then,
my
question
is,
why
do
you
draw
a
distinction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
say
it
would
not
be
effective?
would
it
not
be
true
that
if
you
let...
took
your
view,
it
would
be
in
the
interests
of
the
police
department...
this
was
a
17-day
period
between
the
time
the
warrant
was
taken
out
of
the
system.
why
wouldn't
it
be
wise
for
the
state,
then,
to
adopt
a
system,
just
leave
the
warrants
in
the
system
for
6
months?
it
might
be
helpful
in
an
arrest.
whereas,
if
you
use
the
deterrent,
they
would
take
steps
to
get
them
out
of
the
system
promptly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
doesn't
it
have
a
deterrent
effect
on
the
system
as
a
whole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
incidents
that
happen
on
the
street
do
have
an
impact
on
what's
done
with
this
computer
information--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
the
rule
that
we've
been...
that
the
arizona
court
applied
would
support
making
sure
they
took
action
of
that
kind,
whereas
your
view
would
tolerate
saying,
well,
it's
just
too
bad
this
fellow
got
arrested,
but
we
don't
really
care
about
those
things.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it's
not
necessary--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
would
be
totally
costless
to
the
state
if
you
lose,
because
you
have
already
taken
steps
to
avoid
the
recurrence
of
this
kind
of
mistake,
so
what
are
we
fighting
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
you're
telling
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
what
you're
saying,
that
you've
now
made
sure
this
will
never
happen
again,
which
seems
to
me
to
suggest
that
maybe
it
shouldn't
have
happened
in
the
first
place.
well,
we're
fighting
about
whether
evidence
against
this
guy
which
would
have
shown
him
guilty
of
a
crime
should
be
admitted
in
trial,
isn't
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
the
curative
steps
that
the
county
took?
you
said
they
were
well
before
the
arizona
supreme
court's
decision.
were
they
before
the
trial
court's
order
excluding
the
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
were.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
isn't
it
true
that
you
impose
a
cost
on
society
every
time
you
let
a
person
free,
and
in
order
to
avoid...
just
like
when
you
have
negligence,
there's
costs
involved,
and
that
if
the
cost
is
imposed
on
the
entire
society,
the
entire
society
will
take
steps
to
hire
computer
operators
who
are
efficient
and
honest
and
so
forth.
you're
not
going
to
deter
the
individual
computer
operator,
but
you're...
it's
a
systemic
thing,
and
there
is
a
cost,
whenever
you
suppress
a
warrant,
on
society
as
a
whole,
and
the
remedy
is
that
society
should
make
sure
these
mistakes
don't
happen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
the
most
obvious,
elementary
kind
of
deterrence
that's
all
through
the
tort
system,
where
you
impose
costs
by
making
people
respond...
liable
for
the
negligence
of
their
agents
if
they
harm
somebody?
