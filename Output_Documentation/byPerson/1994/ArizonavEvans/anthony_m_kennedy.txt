--if
we
say
that
there's
a
difference
between
judicial
personnel
and
police
personnel,
if
that's
the
line
we
draw,
is
it
plausible
that
we
might
also
remand
this
case
because
it's
not
clear
what
the
arizona
court
would
have
done
based
on
that
hypothesis,
or
based
on
that
principle?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
then
it's
plausible
and
perhaps
possible
that
you
would
not
get
the
reversal
that
you
seek
if
we
establish
that
principle.
there
would
still
have
to
be
further
proceedings,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see
why,
then,
you're
not
addressing
whether
or
not
police
clerical
error
might
also
be
excused.
you
don't
seem
to
want
to
address
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
you
have
a
warrant
division
in
a
large
metropolitan
police
department
and
the
investigation
officers
are
routinely
checking
with
them
is
the
warrant
division
involved
in
the
arrest
or
in
the
investigation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
in
an
environment
where
the
arizona
supreme
court
excluded
the
evidence.
why
are
you
so
sure
that
these
corrective
measures
were
not
taken
under
threat
of
the
exclusionary
rule
being
applied?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
the
curative
action,
that
they
just
checked
the
computer
entries
for
that
one
day,
or
they
completely
changed
their
system?
what's
the
curative
action
that
was
taken?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
that
one
day?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
were
no
other
systemic
changes
made
in
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--basic
routine
where
one
person
calls
the
other
and
tells
them
to
remove
it
from
the
warrant
list?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that's
the
curative
action
you
rely
on?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
addresses
the
evil
that
you
wish
to
cure,
but
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
perhaps
some
others
of
us,
would
like
to
hear
your
comments
on
why
the
remedy
you
propose
will
cure
that
evil.
the
question
has
been
put
to
you
whether
or
not
computer
operators
will
be
deterred
by
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
you...
i
think
perhaps
you
can
answer
that
yes,
perhaps
no,
but
i'd
like
to
hear
your
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
would
the
computer
operator
be
deterred
by
imposing
the
exclusionary
rule
for
the
computer
operator's
mistake?
by
your
not
saying
that
there
would
be
deterrence,
i
assume
you
think
there
would
be
none.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
as
the
record
of
the
argument
stands
now,
you
do
not
contend
that
any
deterrence
will
be
achieved
by
the
exclusionary
rule.
you're
still
not
answering
that
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can
we
finally
get
to
that,
you
can
tell
us
why?
