chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-1660,
arizona
v.
isaac
evans.
mr.
grant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
sheppard
and
leon
were...
it's
not
as
if
they
were
decided
50
years
ago.
they
were
decided,
what,
10
years
ago?
certainly
that's
the
computer
age,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
lose
your
case
if
you
said
that
the
responsibility
is
not
just
that
of
the
investigating
officer
but
also
of
the
entire
police
department,
but
not
for
mistakes
on
the
judicial
side?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
do
you
deal
with
the
hensley
case
that
justice
o'connor
mentioned,
if
you
say
it
doesn't
go
all
the
way
back
through
the
police
department?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
grant.
ms.
carrigan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
decided
the
case
on
the
basis
that
it
didn't
matter,
didn't
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--whether
it
was
the
police
employees
or
the
justice
court
employees?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
we
were
to
accept
the
state's
submission
here,
presumably
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
or
some
other
arizona
court
would
have
to
make
a
factual
determination?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
what
the
court
would
say,
if
it
accepted
the
state's
submission,
was
that,
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
we
say
that
it
does
make
a
difference
if
the
error
stemmed
from
the
judicial
side
rather
than
the
police
side,
and
so
don't
decide
this
case,
if
you're
deciding
on
the
federal
constitution,
on
the
assumption
that
even
though
the
error
came
from
the
judicial
side,
the
evidence
should
nonetheless
be
excluded.
that
would
obviously
leave
open,
if
you
have
kept
it
open,
any
state
constitutional
question.
may
i
just
ask
a
practical
question,
and
that
is
this:
do
the
law
enforcement
officers
in
maricopa
county
have
any
way
of
maintaining
the
accuracy
of
computer
records
over
time
independent
of
what
happens
in
the
justice
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
carrigan.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
number
93-6060,
arizona
versus
evans.
during
a
routine
traffic
stop,
phoenix
police
officers
arrested
the
respondent
when
their
patrol
car
computer
indicated
that
there
was
an
outstanding
warrant
for
his
arrest.
incident
to
the
arrest,
the
police
discovered
a
bag
of
marijuana
in
respondent’s
car.
because
the
computer
record
upon
which
the
police
had
relied
was
erroneous,
there
was
in
fact
no
outstanding
warrant.
respondent
moved
to
suppress
the
marijuana
as
the
fruit
of
an
illegal
search.
the
arizona
supreme
court
determined
that
the
exclusionary
rule
applied
to
the
marijuana
seized
even
if
before
the
computer
record
was
attributable
to
an
error
committed
by
a
court
employee.
we
granted
certiorari
to
determine
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
encompasses
such
evidence
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
court
today
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
the
exclusionary
rule
is
the
sanction
that
is
appropriate
only
where
the
rule’s
deterrent
function
is
served.
it
historically
was
not
designed
to
deter
a
conduct
by
a
court
employee.
there
is
no
evidence
that
court
employees
are
inclined
to
ignore
or
subvert
the
fourth
amendment
and
there
is
no
basis
for
believing
that
implication
of
the
exclusionary
rule
will
have
a
significant
deterrent
of
the
fact
on
court
employees.
finally
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
could
not
be
expected
to
alter
the
conduct
of
the
arresting
officer
in
this
case,
because
there
is
no
indication
that
he
acted
unreasonably
when
he
relied
up
on
the
computer
record.
we
conclude
that
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
require
a
suppression
of
evidence,
seized
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
where
the
police
rely
upon
an
erroneous
computer
record,
attributable
to
a
clerical
error
by
a
court
employee.
