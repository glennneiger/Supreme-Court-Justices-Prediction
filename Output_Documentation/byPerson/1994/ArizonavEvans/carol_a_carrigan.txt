ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
exception
that
the
government
seeks
is
not
warranted
by
any
of
this
court's
decisions,
including
leon,
and
it's
not
justified.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
no,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
is
at
all
clear
from
the
record,
and
if...
and
the
joint
appendix
has
the
entire
suppression
hearing
in
it,
in
which
the
government
had
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
police
were
blameless.
this
they
did
not
do.
if
you
care
to
go
back
to
that,
you
will
find
that
they
called
as
a
witness
the
chief
clerk
of
the
justice
court,
who
did
not
have
the
responsibility
for
any
of
this
procedure,
so
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
the
justice
court
employees
were
responsible.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
that's
correct.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
that's
correct.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
the...
the
state
is
relying
on
leon
and
sheppard
and
gates,
all
of
which
are
search
warrant
cases,
and
they're
relying
on
krull
and
peltier,
which
are
statute
cases,
but
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
police
action
was
directed
by
someone
other
than
the
police
themselves,
and
it
was
based
upon
an
independent
assessment
that
the
police
action
was
constitutional.
contrast
that
with
what
we
have
here...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
i'd
like
to
hear
your
question.
[laughter]
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
that's
correct.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
i--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--i
think
the
answer
is
found
in
leon
itself.
first,
i
think
we
need
to
understand
that
the
good
faith
exception
is
a
misnomer.
that's
not
really
what
it's
all
about.
it's
about
objectively
reasonable
reliance
on
an
independent
assessment,
and
by
objectively
reasonable,
and
not
subjectively
reasonable,
we're
not
focusing
on
the
arrest,
we're
focusing
on
law
enforcement
as
a
whole,
and
that's
the
phrase
that
appears
in
leon.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
i
believe
that
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
on
pages
24
and
25,
we
suggest
what...
some
alternatives
to
what
should
have
been
done
in
order
to
have
this
be
a
cleaner
computer
procedure.
the
problem
that
exists
here
is
that
no
citizen--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--that's--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
ordinary
citizen
who
is
arrested,
has
his
liberty
deprived
by
a
wrongful
arrest,
doesn't
know
or
care
which
government
employee
is
responsible.
the
problem
is
in
wedding
the
high
tech
of
the
computer
with
the
horse-and-buggy
of
the
written
word,
and
the
problem
that
exists
in
this
particular
case
is
that
you
have
a
system
where
only
the
police
themselves
can
get
that
information,
whether
it's
wrong
or
right,
out
of
that
computer,
and
you
have
a
procedure
where
the
only
time
they
go
back
and
take
something
out
is
under
this
horse-and-buggy,
let's
write
this
down,
let's
call
here,
let's
call
there.
but
the
problem
for
all
of
us
is
that
there
is
so
much
inaccurate
information
going
into
computers,
and
there's
no
housekeeping
going
on.
nobody
is
sweeping
the
store.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
well,
i--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--i
think
the
problem
is
in
the
word
deter,
then,
because
whether
you
say,
deterring
negligent
maintenance,
or
encouraging
housekeeping,
that
is
what
we
are
asking
for.
what
we
are
saying
is,
the
system
as
it
exists
today,
law
enforcement
as
a
whole
with
its
police
computers,
which
are
accessible,
your
honor,
only
by
criminal
justice
agencies,
if
i
want
to
find
out
if
there's
incorrect
information
in
the
system
about
me,
if
there
is
unfortunately
something
in
there
that
says,
carol
carrigan
should
be
arrested,
i
can't
find
that
out
and
i
can't
correct
it
because
i'm
not
a
criminal
justice
agency.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
what
i
am--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is,
we're
not
asking
that
the
sheriff's
clerks
work
faster,
and
we're
not
saying
that
somehow
justice
court
employees
should
make
their
phone
calls
in
the
morning.
what
we're
saying
is,
possibly,
since
the
authority
to
arrest
comes
from
a
magistrate,
the
magistrate
who
issued
that
warrant
issued
it
because
mr.
evans
didn't
show
up
for
his
traffic
tickets.
possibly,
that
magistrate,
when
he
quashes
the
warrant,
should
be
able
to
push
his
own
button
and
eliminate
that
warrant
from
the
system,
but
he
can't
because
he's
not
a
criminal
justice
agency.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
oh,
we
do
indeed,
your
honor,
because--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--because
what
we're
arguing
is
that
if
the
police
are
aware
that
they
are
relying
on
inaccurate
information
in
their
systems,
then
they're
going
to
do
something
about
the
procedure
for
maintaining,
housekeeping,
cleaning,
however
you
want
to
put
it,
to
make
their
systems,
and
they
are
their
systems--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--and
they
have
responsibility
to
make
them
more
accurate.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
well,
i
think
that--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--that
if
the
police
could
put
more
in
the
computer
and
they
could
get
away
with
it,
why,
then
they
would
have
access
to
all
of
us
and
all
of
our
homes,
so
let's
do
away
with--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--yes.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
your
honor--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
i
recall
the
words
that
justice
scalia
wrote
in
arizona
v.
hicks
when
he
said
that
the
criminality
of
the
few
sometimes
must
be
insulated
to
protect
the
privacy
of
us
all.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
if
we
are
doing--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--if
we
are
doing
a
cost
analysis,
your
honor,
what
we
are
comparing
is
the
cost
of
having
mr.
evans
tried
on
a
possession
of
marijuana
case
and
the
cost
to
the
rest
of
us
of
very
real
possibility
of
wrongful
arrest
without
probable
cause.
it's
important
to
remember
that
mr.
evans
was
in
jail
for
2
days
before
the
police
learned,
oh,
he
shouldn't
have
been
there
under
this
warrant.
what
happened
was,
the
initial
appearance
papers
were
sent
over
to
the
justice
court
and
they
realized
that
this
man
shouldn't
have
been--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--that's
correct.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
but
the
implication
for
the
rest
of
us,
your
honor,
is
that
we
could
be
arrested
without
probable
cause
and
we
could
be
incarcerated
for
hours.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
i
think--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--the
court
would
look...
you
were
referring
earlier
to
hensley.
the
court
would
look
to
the
lawfulness
of
the
underlying
arrest,
but
there
is
a
quality--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--no,
your
honor,
you
would
not.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
i...
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
your
example.
the
informant
was
wrong?
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
but
it
was
a
confidential,
reliable
informant
and
that
is
why
it
passed
muster?
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
that
would,
indeed,
be
terrible,
and
it
would
be
one
of
the
things
that
happens
all
too
often,
unfortunately,
but
the
problem
here
is,
we're
not
just
arguing
for
exclusion
to
correct
the
fourth
amendment
invasion
of
mr.
evans,
because
we
know
from
leon
and
calandra
that
exclusion
is
directed,
through
deterrence,
at
protecting
the
rights
of
other
citizens
in
future
encounters
with
the
police,
and
that's
really
what
this
argument
is
all
about.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
well,
i
don't
think
in
the
example
that
we
are
deterring
informants,
your
honor,
but
what
we
do
have
here
is
a
very
shoddy
procedure,
if
you
will,
that
was
set
up
by
the
police
themselves
in
order
to
maintain
their
control
of
their
own
computer,
and
that's
fine,
but
if
they
have
sole
control,
then
they
have
sole
responsibility.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
well,
in
leon...
leon
was
decided,
i
believe,
because
there
was
a
preference
for
warrants,
and
in
leon,
the
exception
was
created.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
any
problem
with
the
idea
that
their...
that
the
power
of
the
police
cannot
be
unleashed
without
any
controls,
and
ordinarily,
when
the
police
invade
someone's
fourth
amendment
rights,
that
evidence
can't
be
introduced
against
him
at
trial.
in
leon,
what
the
court
did
was
say,
we
would
prefer
to
have
officers
go
for
search
warrants
because
there
is
a
measure
of
control
there
and
there
is
an
assurance
that
they
are
at
least
trying
to
act
in
accord
with
the
fourth
amendment.
what
we
have
here
is
a
decision,
17
days
later...
17
days
earlier
by
a
magistrate
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
this
warrant
to
be
outstanding
because
mr.
evans
had
appeared,
so
the
difference
is
that
we
don't
have
an
independent
judicial
determination,
as
we
had
in
leon,
or
in
krull
it
was
a
statute.
have
i
answered
your
question?
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
precisely.
that
is
what
we're
saying,
is
that--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--this
kind
of
procedure--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--the
police
action
in
leon
was
directed
by
a
magistrate
who
issued
a
search
warrant.
the
police
action
in
this
case
was
directed
by
a
police
computer.
we
see
that
as
a
very
real
difference.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
if
i
made
that
assumption,
your
honor,
i
would
try
to
sit
where
the
trial
court
judge
was
sitting,
and
he
said
it
made
no
difference,
it
was
still
the
government,
and
the
government
had
caused
this
person
to
be
arrested
without
probable
cause.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
and
what
we
are
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
there...
that
this
arrest
was
not
based
upon
any
exercise
of
judicial
discretion,
because
after
all,
the
judge
quashed
the
warrant.
this
arrest
was
based
upon
a
ministerial,
clerical
function,
and
when
leon
was
decided,
there
was
great
deference
given
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
judicial
determination.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
hypothetical.
was
this
cocaine
in
plain
view--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--in
the
trunk?
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
and
it
was
something--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--it
was
something
that
was
clearly
recognizable
to
a
street
worker
as
cocaine
and
therefore
was
evidence
in
plain
view?
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
[laughter]
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
and
this--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--and
this
was
a
person
who
had
the
authority
to
arrest,
or
who
made
a
citizen's
arrest
because
he
knew
it
was
cocaine?
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
well,
i
think
probably
there
might
be
both
a
civil
and
a
criminal
action
following--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--if
i'm
understanding
your
question,
you're
honor,
you're
saying,
if
it
is
someone
other
than
the
police,
if
it
is
a
justice
employee
or
perhaps
a
motor
vehicle
department
employee
who
has
something
to
do
with
the
computer,
then
where
should
we
draw
the
line?
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
and
i
think
that
you
have
identified
a
very
real
problem
with
what
the
state
is
proposing
here,
because
in
every
case
there
would
then
have
to
be
a
determination
as
to
who
was
responsible,
and
how
much
involvement
that
person
had
in
law
enforcement
under
leon,
so
as
to--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--we
have
not
abandoned
our
jurisdictional
argument,
your
honor.
if
you
will
look
at
the
decisions
and
what
was
argued
below
by
the
state
and
by
ourselves
in
response,
what
was
really
argued
was
a
state
statute...
that
was
a.r.s.
section
13-3925...
and
it
appears
at
35a
and
36a
of
the
petition's
appendix,
and
what
the
arizona
court
said
was,
we
don't
choose
to
interpret
the
arizona
good
faith
statute
that
way.
i
think
there
really
is
a
jurisdictional
problem
here,
and
i
think
there's
a
problem
with
remand,
because
if
this
court
chooses
to
remand,
then
i
don't
know
what
the
court
will
say
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
about
how
it
should
interpret
its
statute.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
i
think
there
are
two
parts
to
that
answer.
i
think
that
they
have
set
up
a
system
where
the
individual
justice
courts
call
in
to
the
sheriff.
the
second
part
of
that
answer
is
that
they
don't
appear
to
be
doing
any
housekeeping,
and
our
argument
is
that
they
should.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
--yes.
ms.
carol
a.
carrigan
no,
indeed,
your
honor,
because
what
leon
says
is
that
we
will
rest
on
the
assurance
that
some
magistrate
or
judge
doing
his
job
made
an
assessment
on
probable
cause,
but
if
you
look
in
the
leon
decision
at
page
923,
you'll
find
there
are
four
exceptions
to
the
exception,
if
you
will,
and
one
of
those
exceptions
is
if
the
magistrate
abandons
his
job,
or
his
responsibilities.
so
i
don't
believe...
and
the
first
one,
very
importantly,
is
where
the
police
are
guilty
of
submitting
reckless
or
false
information,
and
what
the
court,
the
leon
court
said
about
that
was
that
this
would
be
a
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth
that
they
would
not
condone.
