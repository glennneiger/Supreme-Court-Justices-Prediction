mr.
grant,
it's
not
just
a
problem
of
what
you
want
to
deter,
it's
also
a
problem
of
how
effective
the
deterrent
will
be,
and
i
would
think
that
part
of
your
argument
is
that
it
is
very
effective
when
it's
applied
to
the
arresting
officer,
it's
a
little
less
effective
when
it's
applied
to
the
entire
investigating
team,
but
it
is
infinitely
less
effective
when
you
trace
it
all
the
way
back
to
somebody
who's
not
even
on
the
police
force
but
in
a
court
who's
punching
in
something
in
a
computer.
that
person's
not
going
to
be
very
much
deterred,
is
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
price
we're
paying
is
letting
the
criminal
off,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
sometimes
it's
worth
a
deterrent
where
the
deterrent
is
likely
to
be
very
effective,
but
it's
not
worth
it
when
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
go
on,
finish
your
thought,
what
you
were--
justice
antonin
scalia
--my
problem,
ms.
carrigan,
is
more
fundamental
than
that.
i
really
don't
see
the
slightest...
the
slightest
deterrent
effect
that
will
be
achieved
by
the
exclusion
of
this
evidence.
where
you
are
dealing
with
the
people
who
are
in
the
business
of
making
an
arrest,
who
are
at
least
on
the
team,
you
are
telling
them,
unless
you
do
things
right,
this
arrest
and
whatever
you
get
from
it
is
going
to
be
inadmissible.
that
causes
them
to
be
careful.
but
when
you're
dealing
with
somebody
who's
made
a
negligent
mistake,
who
doesn't
even
expect
an
arrest
to
occur,
how
does
it
possibly
deter
anybody
to
say,
if
you
punch
a
wrong
thing
into
the
computer,
the
mistaken
arrests
for
these
traffic
tickets...
not
showing
up
for
traffic
tickets.
that's
the
misdemeanor
that
the
arrest
was
for,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
this
person
is
picked
up
wrongfully
for
this
misdemeanor
violation,
anything
found
on
him
will
not
be
admissible
in
evidence.
i
mean,
the
person
punching
it
in
doesn't
want
him
to
be
picked
up
anyway,
rightfully
or
wrongfully.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
the
slightest...
i'm
trying
to
put
myself
in
the
position
of
the
person
in
the
judge's
office
who's
punching
it
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
if
somebody
wagged
a
finger
at
me
and
said,
if
you
punch
in
an
arrest
that
shouldn't
be
in
there,
anything
that's
found
in
the
course
of
that
arrest
will
not
be
admissible
in
court.
i
don't
see
how
that
would
make
me
more
careful
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
relying...
you're
not
answering
my...
i
mean,
my
question
goes
to
deterrence,
and
you're
not
answering
that.
you're
relying
instead
on
the
language
of
leon.
now,
that's
fine.
if
you
say,
i
don't
rely
on
deterrence,
i
rely
on
the
language
of
leon,
that's
okay,
but
my
question
was,
how
would
anyone
conceivably
be
deterred
by
the
rule
that
you
ask
us
to
adopt?
i
truly
do
not
see
the
slightest
deterring
effect
upon
somebody's
carelessness
in
the
judge's
office.
justice
antonin
scalia
deterrence,
ms.
carrigan.
how
is
the
system
as
a
whole
deterred?
never
mind
the
policeman,
never
mind
the
clerk
in
the
judge's
office,
how
is
the
system
as
a
whole
deterred
from
being
careless
if
you
tell
the
system,
somebody
whom
you
would
not
get
anyway
had
this
thing
been
kept
off
of
the
computer
entirely,
if
you
do
get
him,
we're
not
going
to
let
you
get
him?
i
don't
see
how
that
deters
the
system
as
a
whole.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
political
process
doesn't
cause
the
system
to
be
careful,
if
people
in
the
municipality
don't
get
enraged
against
their
government
that
allows
these
things
to
happen,
i
don't
see
how
the
government
is
going
to
be
any
more
careful
if
it
says,
you
know,
people
who
shouldn't
be
arrested,
if
they
are
arrested,
it'll
do
no
good
to
arrest
them.
i
don't
see
how
that
deters
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
they
do
that,
because
then
they
won't
be
able
to
arrest
the
person
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
still
will
not
get
the
bad
guy.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
wouldn't
be
able--
--and
that
would
be
a
very
bad
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
maybe
you
want
to
say,
two
wrongs
make
a
right.
this
person's
a
criminal,
but
you
have
violated
his
rights
by
arresting
him
when
he
shouldn't
have
been
arrested,
and
since
you
have,
even
though
it
doesn't
deter
anybody
or
anything,
we're
going
to
say,
the
slate
is
even,
but
that's
not
how
i
understood
we
have
adopted
the
exclusionary
rule
in
the
past.
it's
not
punishing
society
for
doing
a
bad
thing
by
letting
the
criminal
walk
the
streets.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
that.
it's--
[laughter]
in
fact,
it
was
very
well
put.
but
the
difficulty
i
am
having
is
identifying
the
cost
which
you
are
agreeing
with
justice
stevens
that
is
being
imposed
upon
the
society.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
zero
cost.
the
criminal
who
previously
would
not
be
incarcerated
because
the
evidence
would
be
excluded
at
his
trial
will
now
not
be
incarcerated
because
the
warrant
will
never
be
in
the
system.
what
cost
have
you
imposed
upon
anybody?
justice
antonin
scalia
none.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
carrigan,
suppose
the
negligence
here
was
not
on
the
part
of
the
judicial
department,
but
rather
the
arizona
department
of
public
works,
and
let's
assume
the
contraband
was
discovered
not
in
the
course
of
a
mistaken
arrest,
but
rather
in
the
course
of
providing
ambulance
assistance
to
this
individual
after
his
car
has
fallen
into
a
pothole
that
has
been
left
on
the
street
by
the
department
of
public
works.
he
has
this
accident.
they
come
to
help
him,
and
lo
and
behold,
they
find
in
the
car
vast
quantities
of
cocaine.
do
you
think
that
that
evidence
of
his
wrongdoing
should
be
excluded,
because
after
all,
the
government
had
been
negligent,
and
had
it
not
been
negligent,
it
would
never
have
been
discovered?
justice
antonin
scalia
big
pothole--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
was
left
there
by
the
city,
negligently,
okay.
[laughter]
his
car
falls
into
it,
and
when
they
rescue
him,
they
find
the
cocaine.
it's
the
city's
fault.
he
would
never
be
in
that
fix
but
for
the
negligence
of
the
city.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
fair
to
put
him
in
jail
for
the
cocaine?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
yes,
absolutely.
no
doubt
it
was...
yes.
the
only
difference
being,
the
arrest
wasn't
the
product
of
the
negligence.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
yes,
it
was
a
product
of...
there
wasn't
an
arrest.
the
discovery
of
the
cocaine
was
the
product
of
the
negligence.
there's
no
doubt.
if
he
hadn't
fallen
into
the
pothole,
they
wouldn't
have
found
the
cocaine.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you
wouldn't
try
to
keep
him
out
of
jail,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
once
they
saw
the
cocaine,
they
certainly
had
authority
to
arrest
him,
assuming
it
was
okay
for
them
to
be
there,
but
it
wasn't
okay
for
them
to
be
there
if
it
was
the
product
of
the
city's
negligence,
right,
and
it
was,
because
the
city
had
left
the
pothole.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess,
but
i
really
don't...
i
don't
see
a
whole
lot
of
difference
in
the
essentials
between
that
situation
and
what
is
occurring
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
who
has
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
this
person
has
been
discovered
to
be
a
criminal.
