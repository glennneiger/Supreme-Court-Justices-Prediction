justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
mr.
grant,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
law
enforcement
agency,
the
police
or
the
law
enforcement
agency
have
no
duty
or
responsibility
to
keep
computer
records
up
to
date?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
this
instance,
do
we
know
whether
the
police
had
any
obligation
to
update
their
computer
records?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
the
courts
below
never
actually
made
a
determination,
did
they--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
to
whose
error
it
was?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
it
be
a
different
case
if
this
listing
had
continued
for
several
months
and
had
not
been
corrected?
would
there
be
some
point
in
time
when
you
would
think
that
the
blame
could
shift
to
the
police,
and
therefore
exclusion
could
be
a
remedy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
we
actually
don't
know
that
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mm-hmm.
there
was
a
case
that
we
had
that
predated
leon.
it
was
that
whiteley
v.
warden
in
1971,
that
said
where
an
arrest
warrant
is
invalid,
so
is
any
arrest
that
results,
and
the
evidence
must
be
excluded.
do
you
take
the
view
that
leon
altered
that
case
and
that
holding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
grant,
i
thought
in
u.s.
v.
hensley,
decided
in
1985,
that
we
specifically
said
the
rule
is
what
the
police
department
as
a
whole
knows
or
doesn't
know
that
counts
in
determining
the
fourth
amendment
violation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
expressly
said
it
doesn't
rest
on
what
the
arresting
officer
knew
or
didn't
know.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you're
asking
us
to
alter
that,
i
gather.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
think
what
you
say...
at
least
what
you
have
been
saying
is
consistent
with
that
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
you
have
a
system
that
the
police
department
has
invoked
to
enable
it
to
function
that
involves
using
a
computer
system
so
that
they
can
punch
out
the
information
right
there
in
their
vehicles
and
find
out
if
there's
an
outstanding
arrest
warrant.
i
mean,
that's
something
the
police
department
itself
has
made
use
of
for
their
own
purposes,
so
presumably
they
have
some
responsibility
for
how
it
functions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
would
agree
with
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question,
ms.
carrigan,
and
that
is
this:
do
we
take
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
error
that
occurred
here
occurred
within
the
justice
court
and
its
personnel?
is
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
that
the
assumption?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
fact
he
had
narcotics
on
his
possession.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
as
though
you're
dealing
with
somebody
who
hadn't
committed
an
offense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
this:
suppose
a
police
officer
relies
on
an
informant
to
obtain
the
facts
to
go
get
an
arrest
warrant,
and
the
policeman
reasonably
believes
and
reasonably
relies
on
this
informant
and
gets
an
arrest
warrant,
makes
the
arrest,
and
it
turns
out
later
that
the
informant
was
lying.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
that
evidence
would
not
be
suppressed,
i
assume,
under
leon,
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
the
court
would
look
to
see
whether
objectively
the
policeman
made...
took
reasonable
action,
and
if
it's
determined
that
he
did,
we
wouldn't
keep
the
evidence
out
of
court,
would
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
and
i
don't
see
how
this
is
materially
different.
i
mean,
it's
just
as
terrible
for
the
person
who
is
arrested
on
the
basis
of
that
false
information
as
it
is
to
be
arrested
for
a
computer
error,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
it's
determined
by
the
courts
below
that
it
resulted
from
an
error
made
by
the
justice
court,
then
how
do
you
answer
the
question?
let's
say
that's
the
determination,
that
this
error
arose
and
occurred
solely
in
the
justice
court.
make
that
assumption.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
the
issue,
of
course,
and
leon
spoke
in
different
terms,
and
so
we
have
to
ask
why
that
doesn't
control,
because
we
have
said
that
where
the
error
arises
in
the
judicial
branch,
we
don't
think
the
deterrence
is
such
that
it
justifies
excluding
the
evidence.
