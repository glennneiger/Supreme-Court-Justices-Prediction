what
about
the
position
of
the
arizona
supreme
court,
that
seemed
to
say
in
this
modern
age
to
try
to
assign
fault
to
a
particular
piece
of
the
government
doesn't
quite
work,
because
it's
manipulable
where
you
lodge
the
computer.
you
could
do
it
in
a
civil
agency
as
distinguished
from
a
police
authority,
so
it
should
be
not
strict
liability.
someone
is
careless.
that
seemed
to
me
the
position
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
taking.
it
doesn't
quite
fit
when...
in
the
days
when
the
police
officer
could
call
the
court
and
would
have
gotten
accurate
information,
the
shift
from
those
days
to
the
day
when
you
touch
a
couple
of
buttons
and
you
get
an
answer
on
the
screen.
wasn't
the
arizona
supreme
court
telling
us
the
fix
on
the
police
station
as
distinguished
for
the
system
is
wrong
for
the
computer
age?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well--
--isn't
the
purpose
here,
though,
deterrence,
deterrence
not
of
errors
that
crop
up
or
that
take
a
few
days
to
correct,
but
of
carelessness,
and
the
deterrent
purpose
is
to
keep
official
records
updated?
isn't
it
a
powerful
deterrent
to
say,
if
you
don't
update
within
a
reasonable
time,
you
can't
use
the
evidence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--arizona
supreme
court,
though,
to
have
taken
a
different
line.
i
read
that
court
to
say,
it's
the
legal
system
that
installed
these
computers,
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
slip...
there
must
be
a
slip,
but
the
question
of
where
the
slip
is
in
the
court,
in
the
police
office,
should
not
be
dispositive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
trial
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they
did
not
have
it
wrong--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
they
had
slipped--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
my
question,
mr.
grant,
is
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
going
off
on
something
new,
and
they're
very
candid
about
it,
so
i'm...
i
listen
to
your
argument,
and
it's
true
that
you
are
putting
this
case
in
the
leon
frame.
the
arizona
supreme
court
told
us
that
leon
is
not
helpful
as
it
sees
the
case,
and
it
was
very
clear
what
it
was
about.
it
said,
it's
repugnant
to
the
principles
of
a
free
society
that
a
person
should
be
taken
into
police
custody
because
of
a
computer
error
precipitated
by
government
carelessness.
as
automation
increasingly
invades
modern
life,
the
potential
for
orwellian
mischief
grows.
under
such
circumstances,
the
exclusionary
rule
is
a
cost
we
cannot
afford
to
be
without.
now,
you
may
say,
that's
a
new
tack,
it
shouldn't
be
taken,
but
at
least
deal
with
this
opinion
on
its
own
terms.
it's
not
talking
about
deterring
the
policeman,
it's
talking
about
keeping
the
computer
system
up
to
date.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
pretty
powerful
language,
and
i
don't
think
it's
at
all
ambiguous.
what
he--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--my
concern
is
this
court
seems
to
be
saying,
we're
getting
to
the
21st
century,
and
the
old
kind
of
errors
are
not
going
to
be
the
ones
that
will
be
of
major
concern.
this
is
what
will
be
a
major
problem.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
computers
that
have
misinformation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
carrigan,
maybe
you
can
clarify
this.
you
are
not
talking
about
deterring
the
policeman
who
goes
into
his
car
and
pushes
some
buttons,
you
are
talking
about
deterring,
not
even
a
particular
clerk,
you're
talking
about
the
government
system
of
keeping
records--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
i
understand
you
correctly?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
why
the
arizona
supreme
court
said
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
it's
government
carelessness
and
that
you
shouldn't
have
to
have
a
trial
over
about
whether
it's
the
clerk
in
the
police
station
or
the...
but
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
what
you
argued
in
your
brief
in
opposition.
there
was
a
strong
reply
to
it.
you
had
said
initially
arizona,
with
this
broad
language,
wasn't
having
anything
to
do
with
the
federal
interpretation
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
that
it
was
deciding
this
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
answer
was,
no,
arizona
in
the
fourth
amendment
area
takes
the
federal
standard,
and
that's
what
it's
attempting
to
apply.
do
you
think
you
have
an
argument?
let's
say
this
would
be
remanded
to
the
arizona
supreme
court.
worry
about
your
own
constitution,
which
would
then
leave
arizona
to
its
new
way
and
not
involve
any
federal
question.
