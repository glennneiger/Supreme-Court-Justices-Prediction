justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
else
you'd
like
to
say
about
the
problem
of
the
computer?
i
mean,
as...
are
there
any
facts
or
any
indication
about
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
would
or
would
not
lead
people
to
be
more
careful
about
these
things?
i
mean,
to
be
specific,
it
is
bad
to
let
the
guilty
person
off,
we
all
know
that,
but
there's
a
rule
which
says
if
it's
unconstitutional
the
evidence
doesn't
come
in.
then
there's
an
exception
to
that
rule,
is
if
the
officers
were
in
good
faith,
and
i
guess
that
exception
rests
on
the
theory
that
putting
that
pressure
on
the
officers
in
a
leon-type
case
doesn't
make
any
difference,
but
here,
obviously,
people
are
thinking
that
putting
pressure
on
the
system
in
this
kind
of
case
might
make
a
difference
because
everybody's
name
might
be
in
a
computer,
and
it's
a
pressure
that
would
lead
people
to
be
careful
about
that
computer
generating
false
arrest
warrants
which
aren't
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
seems
to
be
what
people
are
driving
at,
and
i
just
wondered,
you're
familiar
with
the
operations
of
these
things,
and
is
there
any
light
you
can
shed
on
whether
the
pressure
that
would
be
put
on
computer
operators
and
all
those
associated
with
it
to
be
careful
not
to
arrest
people
where
there
is
no
arrest
warrant,
why
that
pressure
wouldn't
be
meaningful,
or
significant,
or
the
same
as
normal
in
an
exclusionary
rule
case,
or
maybe
the
opposite?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
then
what
is
the...
let
me
go
back
to
that.
what...
look,
i
take
it
in
general,
not
in
the
leon
cases,
the
law
thinks
that
if
you
say
to
policemen,
hey,
watch
what
you're
doing,
get
your
act
together,
because
if
you
don't
and
find
you
really
have
cause
to,
they'll
throw
out
the
whole
conviction,
the
whole
thing
will
get
mixed
up.
that
makes
policemen
get
their
act
together.
informants
won't
get
their
act
together,
but
what
about
computer
operators?
that
is
to
say,
is
it
plausible
to
think
that
telling
the
computer
operator,
hey,
get
your
act
together,
otherwise,
when
the
policeman
arrests
somebody
the
whole
thing's
going
to
get
thrown
out,
and
probably
he
could
have
arrested
him
for
some
other
reason
if
only
he'd
gotten
his
act
together.
so
you
tell
that
to
the
computer
operator.
is
it
plausible
to
think
the
computer
operator
is
more
like
the
informant,
or
more
like
the
policeman?
in
other
words,
is
this
case
distinguishable
from
leon?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
leave
that.
is
this
case
different
from
leon?
why?
in
both
cases
there's
a...
in
leon,
there's
an
arrest
warrant.
it's
invalid,
in
fact...
a
search
warrant,
i
guess,
invalid.
here
they
think
there's
a
warrant
and
it's
not
valid.
there
is
none.
in
both
cases
somebody
else
made
the
mistake.
it
wasn't
the
policeman.
and
so,
is
there
actually
a
way
to
distinguish
this
from
leon?
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
sure,
because
i
mean,
in
here,
all
the
people
who
went
to
apply
for
a
warrant
did
go
to
apply
for
a
warrant.
the
process
worked
out
just
as
it
was
supposed
to
work
out.
it
turned
out
that
there
was
no
warrant,
just
as
in
leon
it
turned
out
that
the
warrant
was
fatally
defective.
i
mean,
the
policeman
in...
was
there
something
else
the
policeman
should
have
done
here,
or
anyone
should
have
done?
there's
a
mistake
here.
so
was
there
a
mistake
in
leon.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
a
different
kind
of
mistake?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
difference?
what's
the
difference
in
the
kind
of
mistake,
that's
what's
worrying
me.
is
there
a
difference
in
the
kind
of
mistake
here?
