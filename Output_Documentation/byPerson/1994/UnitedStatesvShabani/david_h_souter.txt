justice
david
h.
souter
but
she
could
not
have
solved
the
problem
of
the
allegation.
i
mean,
she,
if
an
overt
act
was
an
essential
element,
she
could
not
have
amended
the
indictment
at
that
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
one
place
we
locate
it
is
under
the
general
rule
of
following
common
law
definitions.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
do
that,
you
lose.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
1970
view
was
sir
edward
cook's
view,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
we
had
a
celestial
resonance
machine
that
could
bring
up
the
image
of
a
common
law
lawyer,
we'd
get
sir
edward
cook
right
in
the
front
of
the
line,
wouldn't
we?
[laughter]
and
his
view
was
that
you
didn't
need
an
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
counts
for
the
other
side.
