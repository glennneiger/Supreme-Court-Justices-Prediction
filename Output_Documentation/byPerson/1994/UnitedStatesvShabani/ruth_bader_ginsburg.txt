mr.
seamon,
this
was
an
avoidable
controversy,
was
it
not,
because
the
overt
acts
were
proved,
but
the
prosecutor
insisted
that
the
charge
not
include
that
specification?
in
other
words,
the
overt
act
requirement
in
a
case
such
as
this
is
not
difficult
to
show,
it
was
in
fact
shown,
and
yet
the
prosecutor
resisted
the
charge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
prosecutor
could
have
mooted
this
controversy
by
allowing
the
charge
to
be
made?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she
chose
not
to
do
so,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
go
back
to
your
first
argument,
the
text
of
the
statute,
and
you
say
that
846
was
not
an
attempt
to
define
the
word
conspiracy,
that
might
be
more
persuasive
if
371,
the
general
conspiracy
statute,
had
read,
if
two
or
more
persons
agree,
but
it
doesn't.
it
reads,
if
two
or
more
persons
conspire,
and
one
or
more
such
persons
do
any
act,
so
conspire...
both
statutes
say,
any
person
who
conspires,
two
or
more
persons
conspire.
the
overt
act
is
added
on
as
something
additional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
your
argument
that
congress
would
have
to
say,
and
there
is
no
overt
act
requirement,
in
order
to
give
a
conspiracy
statute
that
effect?
in
other
words,
there's
not
enough
to
leave
out,
as
371
has
it,
that
there
is
an
overt
act
requirement,
but
congress
would
have
to
say,
and
we
do
not
mean
that
there
should
be
any
overt
act
requirement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
it
necessary?
if
congress
doesn't
want
an
overt
act--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
must
it
do
to
accomplish
that
intent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
putting
it
on
the
face
of
the
statute
means,
and
we
do
not
mean
that
there
be
any
overt
act
requirement,
is
that
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
taking
the
position
that
even
when
the
statute
on
its
face
requires
an
overt
act,
the
government
doesn't
have
to
allege
it
in
the
indictment,
it's
enough
that
they
prove
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
no
rule
for
when
it
has
to
be
both
alleged
and
proved
and
when
it
suffices
to
have
it
proved
even
if
it
isn't
alleged?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
it
was
hard
book
law
that
essential
elements
of
a
crime
must
be
pled
in
an
indictment.
that
doesn't
mean
every
detail
of
your
proof,
but
the
requisites
to
spell
out
the
crime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
glad
you
clarified
your
position,
because
i
thought
you
were
disagreeing
with
the
ninth
circuit
to
the
extent
that
they
didn't
require
the
act
to
be
alleged,
but
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
is
right
in
its
middle
view?
