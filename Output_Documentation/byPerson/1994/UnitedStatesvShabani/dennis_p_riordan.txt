mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
both
parties
to
this
action
agree
that,
if
possible,
the
meaning
of
this
statute
should
be
settled
on
its
face.
both
parties
agree
that
in
this
case
it
cannot
be
settled
by
simple
reference
to
the
text
of
the
statute
without
reference
to
any
other
historical
statutory
or
precedential
source,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
it
contains
the
term
conspire,
and
conspiracy.
if
congress
had
said...
instead
of
using
the
term
conspire
had
used
the
word
agree,
if
you
agree
to
commit
a
crime,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
we
all
agree
that
the
term
agree
has
a
common
meaning.
it
means
a
meeting
of
the
minds.
we
all
agree
that
a
meeting
of
the
minds
doesn't
require
or
imply
further
action.
people
agree
with
their
doctors
every
day
to
stop
smoking,
and
further
action
is
neither
necessary
to
that
term
nor,
as
we
know,
frequently
none
follows,
but
in
this
case
they
use
conspire
and
conspiracy,
and
both
parties
agree
that
there
is
probably
no
term
in
the
criminal
law
less...
less
capable
of
easy
analysis
or
common
understanding
than
the
terms
conspire
and
conspiracy.
in
an
article
relied
on
by
both
parties,
by
benjamin
pollack,
professor
pollack
stated
that
the
crime
of
conspiracy
"is
the
most
difficult
to
define.
"
and
it
is
almost
impossible
to
confine
the
true
law
of
conspiracy
within
the
bounds
of
a
definite
statement.
so
we
are
left,
then,
with
the
terms,
conspire
and
conspiracy,
and
the
question,
what
do
they
mean
in
846?
the
legislative
history,
we
both
agree,
doesn't
help
us.
there
is
no
legislative
history.
there
is
no
indication
anywhere
in
the
statute
whether,
when
congress
used
the
terms,
conspire
and
conspiracy,
it
meant
by
those
terms
the
definition
of
conspiracy
such
as
in
371,
which
contains
an
overt
act
requirement,
or,
on
the
other
hand,
it
meant
some
different
definition.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
we
do
in
this
sense
we
think
it
helps
us,
and
here's
why,
your
honor.
if
846
was
a
statute
that
was
intended
to
define
the
elements
of
conspiracy,
it
was
intended
to
provide
a
selfcontained
definition
of
conspire
and
conspiracy,
then
we
would
admit
that
the
failure
not
to
include
an
overt
act
requirement
when
it
is
included
in
371
would
be
very
significant.
but
one
thing
that's
been
missed
here
is
that
846
is
not
a
definitional
statute,
and
it's
not
a
conspiracy
statute.
it's
called,
"attempts
and
conspiracies".
that's
the
title
of
it.
it
deals
with
two
crimes,
not
one,
attempt
and
conspiracy,
and
its
function
is
not
to
define
either
attempt
or
conspiracy,
but
to
set
the
punishment
for
attempts
and
conspiracies.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
if,
as
i
say,
846
was
intended
to
be
definitional,
to
contain...
if
we
could
discern
from
it
an
intent
by
congress
to
state
the
elements
of
conspiracy,
then
that
argument
would
be
persuasive.
but
the
federal
courts
have
looked
at...
for
an
example,
the
attempt
portion
of
this,
it
says
that
the
punishment
for
attempts
and
for
conspiracies
shall
be
the
same
as
for
the
substantive
offense
either
attempted
or
which
was
the
object
of
conspiracy.
the
federal
courts
have
confronted
the
issue
of
what
attempt
means,
and
in
a
long
line
of
cases
they
have
said,
there
is
no
definition
of
attempt
in
846.
we
have
to
look
elsewhere
for
it.
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
joyce
case,
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
monduhano
case
said,
we
can't
discern
what
attempt
means
from
looking
at
846,
so
therefore
we
have
to
go
to
the
model
penal
code,
to
a
learned
hand
opinion
in
1951,
and
in
the
joyce
case
to
a
1901
oliver
wendell
holmes
opinion
written
when
he
was
on
the
massachusetts
state
courts,
to
find
out
what
attempt
means.
if
congress
did
not,
and
it
certainly
did
not,
provide
the
elements
of
attempt,
or
a
definition
of
attempt,
in
846,
then
we
can't
assume
that
it
provided
a
definition
of
conspiracy.
what
we
can
assume
is
it
inserted
the
words
attempt
and
conspiracy
knowing
that
the
definition
of
those
terms
would
be
located
elsewhere.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
ah--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--no,
we
don't,
your
honor,
and
here's
why,
because
again,
in
the
sources
that
we've
cited,
the
pollack
article,
the
sayre
article,
the
harno
article,
the
definitive
studies
of
the
common
law,
there's
a
consensus
that
over
800
years
of
english
history,
and
it
hardly
should
come
as
a
surprise,
that
conspiracy
meant
different
things
at
different
times.
what
the
government
has
done
is
said
that
the
term,
the
meaning
of
the
common
law
definition
of
conspiracy,
is
fixed
by
the
1611
poulterers'
case,
and
the
poulterers'
case
was
not
even
before
a
common
law
court,
it
was
before
the
star
chamber,
which
was
not...
i'm
no
legal
historian,
but
it
was
not
a
common
law
court,
it
was
a
prerogative
court,
a
court
of
the
king.
and
to
suggest
that
when
congress
in
1970
looked
for
a
common
law
definition,
if
that's
what
it
was
going
to
do,
it
looked
to
a
decision
of
the
star
chamber,
when
this
country
was
founded
on
a
rejection
of
star
chamber
precedent,
that
andrew
hamilton
thundered
against
application
of
the
star
chamber
precedents
in
his
defense
of
john
peter
zanger--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--well,
i
would
suggest
to
you,
your
honor,
if
we
could
be
certain
of
one
thing,
if
there
was
a
celestial
magnetic
resonance
imaging
machine
that
could
produce
a
graph
of
what
congress
was
thinking
in
1970
when
it
passed
this
statute,
i'd
suggest
we'd
find
that
it
wasn't
thinking
about
the
issue
of
an
overt
act--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--but
congress--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--cook
did
say
that.
cook
did
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
but
that
was
hardly
the
only
definition
of
conspiracy
given
at
common
law,
but
more
importantly,
what
the
government
is
saying
is
that
when
congress
didn't
speak
to
this
question
at
all,
the
overt
act
being
in
or
out,
it
must
have
been
thinking
about
the
common
law,
and
it
must
have
been
thinking
about
those
precedents,
nash
and
singer,
which
suggest
that
if
you
don't
say
anything
about
an
overt
act,
then
you're
getting
the
common
law
definition.
but
in
1970,
there
were
also
100
years
of
decisions
from
this
court--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--i'm
lucky,
because
the
answer
to
the
two
pending
questions
is
the
same.
in
13...
in
371,
when
it
was
passed
in
1867,
they
used
the
term
conspire,
and
they
included
the
overt
act
requirement,
but
by
1970
there
were
100
years
of
decisions
from
this
court
which
said,
as
bannon
and
mulkey
said,
as
hyde
said,
that
congress
had
decided
to
reject
the
common
law,
the
star
chamber
definition
of
conspiracy--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--that's
right.
that's
right.
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--that's
right,
and
the
question
is
whether,
in
1970,
after
a
statute,
admittedly
a
statute
which
expressly
included
an
overt
act
requirement,
and
100
years
of
judicial
gloss
on
that
statute,
congress,
when
it
was
standing
around
putting
two
different
offenses
in
a
statute,
assumed
that
the
word
conspiracy
meant
what
it
had
meant
for
100
years
under
371,
but--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--no,
we're--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--we're
in
complete
agreement,
your
honor.
what
we're
dealing
with
here...
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
legal...
legal
fictions
which,
in
a
situation
where
congress--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--right.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
that's
true,
but
as
i
say,
your
honor,
if...
if
we
can
say
that
congress
was
focused
on
the
definition...
we
know
that
they
did
not
provide...
they
did
not
suggest
one
element
of
the
crime
of
attempt.
the
federal
courts
have
looked
at
the
attempt
side
of
846
and
thrown
up
their
hands
and
said,
congress
didn't...
they
didn't
define
it,
they
didn't
give
a
hint
what
it
meant,
and
they're
all
over
the
lot
in
attempting
to--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--right.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
i
quite
agree,
your
honor,
which
means
that
we're
in
the
position
of
attempting
to
figure
out
whether
congress
put
all
of
the
elements
in
there,
and
if
it
didn't
put
all
of
the
elements
in
there,
where
do
we
look
to
find
them?
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right,
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
are
in
a
situation
where
i
think
that
we
could
be
relatively
certain
that
congress
didn't
think
at
all
about
this
issue.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
because
according
to
the
cases
that
have
interpreted
371
from
this
court,
the
court
said
that
in
1867
when
they
were
writing
a
general
federal
conspiracy
statute
for
the
first
time,
they
made
a
conscious
decision
to
reject
the
common
law
model,
so
we
know
that's
why
they
did
it.
they
were
starting
from
the
ground
up.
the
question
is,
with
a
silent
legislative
history
in
1970,
is
there
anything
to
indicate
that
they
thought
about
it
at
all,
or
when
they
used
the
term
conspire
and
conspiracy,
they
could
have
well
said
that
what
they
meant
in
the
situation
is
whatever
conspire
and
conspiracy
has
come
to
mean
under
the
general
conspiracy
statute.
if
you're
asking
me
whether
i
can
demonstrate
to
you
that
that
is
what
congress
was
thinking,
the
answer
is
no.
the
burden,
however,
in
this
case
is
on
a
party
such
as
myself
to,
and
the
defendant
in
this
case
to,
suggest
that
there's
a
reason
to
doubt
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
because
if
there
is
a
reason
to
doubt
that
the
congress
expressly
intended
to
delete
an
overt
act
requirement,
then
the
rule
of
lenity
kicks
in,
and
we
have
to
interpret
it
in
such
a
way
that's
favorable
to
the
defendant,
knowing
that
congress
always
has
the
option
should
we
be
wrong,
should
we
find
out
that
we
have
a
position
on
the
matter,
to
correct
the
statute.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
that's
absolutely
true,
your
honor,
and
what
ultimately
we
are
saying
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
not
only
a
reason,
there
are
many
reasons
to
doubt
the
interpretation
that
the
government
relies
on
here,
that
they
are
saying
that
congress
made
a
conscious
decision
to
eliminate
an
overt
act
requirement.
and
let
me
point
out--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--it
sure
would
have
helped.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
if
it
doesn't
want
an
overt
act,
the
easiest
and
simplest
thing
to
do,
since
we
all
agree
that
if
possible
this
is
the
way
we
should
interpret
statutes,
is
to
put
it
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
secondly,
if
there
was
an
express
statement
in
the
legislative
history--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--that's
right.
that's
right.
then
the
whole
question
of
what's
the
significance
of
371,
which
contains
an
overt
act
requirement,
would
be
omitted.
absent
that,
it
could
have
a
legislative
intent
that
suggests
that
that
was
its
clear
intent.
thirdly--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--well,
the
committee
reports
could
make
clear
that,
unlike
371...
i
realize
that
the--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--i
realize
that
there
are
some...
there's
doubt
in
some
quarters
of
whether
that's
a
reliable
source,
but
it
would
be
more
helpful
to
either
side
if
it
were
there
rather
than
complete
silence.
or,
your
honor,
if
the
precedent
of
this
court,
its
decisions
concerning
conspiracy,
were
uniform
as
to
what
the
terms
meant,
it
would
be
something
else.
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
100
years
of
this
court's
decisions
saying
not
merely
that
371
has
an
overt
act
requirement,
but
saying
why
that's
a
very
good
thing.
the
cases--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--they're
a
very
thin
read,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
in
nash,
nash
dealt
with
a
sherman
antitrust
conspiracy
statute,
which
is
outside
the
purview
of
normal
criminal
law.
in
nash,
it
does
contain
the
statute
that,
absent
an
overt
act
requirement,
we
look
to
the
common
law,
but
interestingly
enough,
the
rest
of
the
nash
opinion
says,
reverses
the
conviction
there,
because
the
government
failed
to
prove
an
act.
that
is,
in
the
antitrust
context,
the
government
alleged
the
specific
means
by
which
trade
was
obstructed,
and
the
court
found
that
the
obstructions
in
that
case
were
such
that
they
permitted
the
jury
to
convict
without
finding
that
the
means
was
proven,
and
the
supreme
court
said,
given
what
it
says
in
the
sherman
act,
we
don't
have
any
reason
to
go
further.
well,
the
sherman
act,
as
pled
and
proved
in
that
case,
required
action,
so
it
wasn't
a
case
where
nash
was
saying,
we're
now
going
to
have
a
conspiracy
statute
which
does
require
the
government
to
plead
and
prove
actions,
because
they
did
in
the
nash
case.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
they
most
assuredly
did.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
because
we're
dealing
not
with
an
antitrust
statute
or
a
selective
service
statute,
we're
dealing
with
a
statute
that's
traditionally
in
the
criminal
area.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right,
but
we're
talking
about,
as
this
court
said
in
mci,
the
really
relevant
period
of
time
to
figure
out
statutory
intent
is
the
time
that
the
law
was
passed,
which
is
1970.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
and
had
it
been
explicit
in
doing
so,
our
task
would
be
very
easy,
but--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--well,
if
this
legislative
history
indicated
the
slightest
cognizance
of
nash
and
singer,
no,
they
don't
have
to
state
it
explicitly,
but
again,
it
would
help
if
there
was
even
the
faintest
footprint
of
nash
and
singer
in
the
developmental
process
of
this
statute.
there
isn't,
so
we're
again
confounded
as
to
where
to
go
and
what
to
look
for.
and
let's
remember
the
practical
consequences
of
this
in
this
sense
did
congress,
could
it
be
said
that
they
felt
it
was
necessary
to
eliminate
the
overt
act
requirement
from
the
drug
conspiracy
statute?
federal
drug
laws
right
now
criminalize
every
drug
transaction
that
goes
on
in
the
united
states.
the
federal
government...
or
virtually.
the
federal
government
has
no
desire,
nor
any
capacity,
to
prosecute
anything
other
than
the
tiniest,
tiniest
fraction
of
those
cases
that
literally
come
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
drug
laws.
the
notion
that
in
order
to
enforce
the
federal
drug
laws
which
already
are
far
broader
than
the
actual
ambit
that
they're
going
to
focus
on,
that
congress
needed
to
eliminate
from
drug
conspiracies
the
overt
act
requirement,
which
is
satisfied
by
the
most
minimal,
by
the
most
minimal
action,
it
doesn't
even
need
to
be
an
illegal
action,
i
would
suggest
simply
doesn't
make
any
sense
at
all.
and
on
the
other
hand,
what
it's
doing
is
cutting
up
against
the
cases
of
this
court
such
as
yates,
such
as
hyde,
such
as
bannon
and
mulkey,
which
say
the
function
of
the
overt
act
requirement
is
to
provide
a
locus
poenitentiae,
that
is,
a
point
where
somebody
knows
they're
going
to
be
punished
if
they
take
even
the
slimmest
overt
act
step
forward.
secondly,
to
allow
those
who
form
a
joint
mental
state
but
do
nothing
about
it,
terminate
that
evil
thinking
before
they
go
forward,
and
to
provide,
to
assure
society
that
this
action
has
gone
forward
in
some
way
which
begins
to
threaten
its
societal
interest.
those
are
all
very,
very
good
objectives
of
the
overt
act
requirement,
and
they,
this
court
has
found
them
desirable
in
the
context
of
371.
i
would
suggest
that
there's
as
much
reason
to
believe
that
congress
read
those
opinions
about
the
function
of
the
overt
act
requirement
as
there
is
to
believe
that
it
read
nash
and
singer,
which
are
sherman,
you
know,
a
sherman
antitrust
case,
or
the
selective
service--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--well,
i
think
we--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--well,
i
think
that
we
both
agree
that
we're
discussing
a
level
of
fantasy
here,
because
this
is
all
legal
fiction.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
i--
[laughter]
i
am,
your
honor,
but
the
difference
is
that
i
am
not
asking
the
court
to
accept
my
view
of
the
legislative
history
of
846.
i
am
merely
suggesting
that
it
is
a
reasonable
view
of
what
congress
may
have
been
thinking
or
not
thinking
in
1970,
and
if
it
is
a
reasonable
view
of
what
congress
may
or
may
not
have
been
thinking,
if
it
raises
a
reasonable
doubt
about
whether
there's
an
element
of
an
overt
act
in
this
statute,
then
we're
in
the
situation
of
invoking
the
rule
of
lenity,
which
ultimately
is
really
our
entire
case,
that
is,
that
the
statute
is
uncertain.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
it
is
neither
our
view
nor
the
view
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
this
came
up
during
the
argument
before,
because
the
ninth
circuit
has
never
held
that
the
act
had
to
be
alleged,
it
merely
has
held
that
it
had
to
be
proven,
and
the
government
has--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--that's
right.
the
government
has--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
whether...
i
suppose
it
would
depend
how
it
were
written,
but
it
is
possible
that
if
there
were
explicit
statutory
requirements
it
might
well
have
to
be
alleged.
i
simply...
it
is
not--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--that's
right.
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
has
taken
the
position,
in
fact
it
did
in
this
very
case
below,
that
there
was
no
failure...
the
government
did
not
err
in
failing
to
include
the
overt
act
requirement
expressly
in
the
indictment,
and
therefore
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
a
dismissal
under
ninth
circuit
precedent.
they
merely
would
have
had
to
instruct.
so
therefore
the
error
below
is
not
the
failure
to
include
the
allegation,
the
error
was
the
failure
to
instruct
upon
it,
and
the
government
has
said
a
number
of
times
that
the
overt
acts
here
were
proven.
we
don't
know
whether
they
were
proven.
we
do
know
that
the
jury
never
made
a
finding.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
in
the
sense
that
it
is
something
that
has
to
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
order
to
sustain
a
conviction,
yes,
that
is
the
position
the
ninth
circuit
has
taken.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
i
should
know
the
answer
to
this
question,
your
honor,
but
i'll
tell
you
as
a
criminal
lawyer
it's
never
been
my
impression
that
there's
a
statutory
requirement
that
all
elements
of
the
offense
have
to
be
alleged
in
the
indictment
in
order
to
go
to
the
jury,
either
under
state
or
federal
law.
i'm
relatively
certain
that
federal
prosecutors
as
a
practice
don't
include
all
of
the
elements
of
a
crime
in
the
indictment.
we
have
essentially
notice
pleading.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
in
the
sense...
in
the
sense
that
each
element
of
the
offense,
each
mental
state
element,
for
instance,
is
not
included
within
the
pleading.
there
can
be
four
or
five--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--it's
a
very
good
thing
that
the
answer
to
that
question
isn't
critical
to
the
court's
decision
of
this
case,
because
i
will
confess
that
i
don't
know
the
answer,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
i
want
to
make
absolutely
clear
that
the
issue
of
whether
the
ninth
circuit
was
right
in
rejecting
the
contention
that
the
elements
had
to...
the
overt
act
had
to
be
pled
is
not
before
the
court,
and
i
am
taking
no
position
on
it.
i
am
certainly
not
saying
that
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
below
that
says
it
doesn't
have
to
be
alleged
is
in
any
way
incorrect.
i'm
merely
defending
the
position
that
the
overt
act
is
an
element
of
the
offense
that
has
to
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
which
is
the
position
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
taken,
correctly,
we
believe,
in
contraposition
to
eleventh
circuit's.
i
prepared
for
the
argument
today
by
watching
henry
fonda,
who
argued
against
11
in
twelve
angry
men.
we
acknowledge
that
other
circuits
have
gone
the
other
way
on
this
question,
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
i
have
seen
nothing
in
those
decisions
that
has
focused
on
the
fact
that
846
is
not
a
conspiracy
statute,
it
deals
with
more
than
one
offense,
and
that
its
primary
function
is
to
set
penalty
rather
than
to
define
the
offenses,
and
that's
a
fact
that
those
opinions
simply
haven't
contended
with,
and
we
think
it's
absolutely
critical
to
the
correct
decision
of
this
case.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
in
which
respect?
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
it
is
different
in
this
respect,
your
honor
many
states
have
classified
felonies
a,
b,
c,
and
d,
and
there's
a
whole
group
of
felonies
that
fit
in
each
class.
if
we
found
a
statute
that
said,
class
a
felonies
will
be
punished
by
a
sentence
of
death
or
life
without
parole,
we
would
not
be
surprised
that
they
didn't,
in
that
same
statute,
list
all
the
elements
of
those
offenses.
even
if--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
i
am,
in
the
sense
that
371
deals
with
the
crime
of
conspiracy,
and
conspiracy
alone,
and
846
deals
with
more
than
one
offense,
and--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--well,
i
suggest
that
since
we
know
from
the
case
precedent
that
congress...
the
courts
have
uniformly
declared
that
congress
wasn't
focusing
on
the
elements
of
attempt,
i
think
it's
fair
to
infer
in
this
very
statute
that
they
weren't
focusing
on
the
elements
of
conspiracy.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
the
legislative...
the
courts'
interpretations
of
that
seems
to
be
that
since
this
was
the
first
general
conspiracy
statute
in
871,
they
were
focused
on
the
fact
that
they
wanted
to
create
a
statute
that
had
an
overt
act
requirement
that
didn't
exist
at
the
star
chamber
and
at
english
common
law,
and
we
would
suggest
that,
100
years
later,
there
may
well
have
been
congressmen
thinking
the
overt
act
requirement
had
worked
its
way
into
the
warp
and
woof
of
the
definition
of
conspiracy
in
this
country,
that
that's
the
american
definition
of
conspiracy.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
i--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--i'm
sure
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
in
joyce
and
monduhano,
the
federal
court
said,
look,
we
don't
get
any
guidance
on
what
the
term
attempt
means
from
the
statute
itself,
and
all
we're
saying
is,
we
think
the
same
is
true
of
the
conspiracy
end
of
the
statute,
and
that
the
courts
have
to
look
elsewhere
to
figure
out
what
the
heck
this
means,
and
we
think
that
one
reasonable
interpretation
is
that
congress
thought
that
when
it
uses
conspiracy
and
conspire,
it
was
referring
to
the
kind
of
offense
contained
in
the
general
federal
conspiracy
statute.
admittedly,
that
is
not...
that
is
not...
that's
not
the
only
reasonable
interpretation
of
371.
the...
of
846.
we
concede
that
the
government's
reading
of
846
is
indeed
reasonable.
we
could
concede
that
perhaps
there's
a
probability
that
it's
right,
but
we
think
there's
a
very
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute
which
suggests
that
congress
was
not
focused
on
deciding
that
one
way
or
the
other,
and
we
have
to
look
elsewhere
for
the
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
thank
you.
mr.
seamon,
you
have
16
minutes
remaining.
