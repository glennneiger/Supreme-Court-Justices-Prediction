justice

scalia
and
that
wouldn't
be
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
in
the
normal
meaning
of
that
term,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
maybe
you
could
put
it,
maybe,
that
it
should
not
be
punished
in
all
the
other
circuits
in
the
country,
just
as
it
is
not
in
the
ninth.
i
mean,
that's
just
as
much
the
question
before
us,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
basis
of
statutes
that
did
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is,
on
the
basis
of
statutes
that
included
an
overt
act
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
the
majority
of
people
in
congress
really
had
no
knowledge
of
those
cases
at
all
and
wrote
a...
you
really
think
a
majority
of
people
in
congress
knew
all
the
cases
we're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
even
knew
who
sir
edward
cook
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
left
with
the
language
that
congress
adopted,
and
we
have
to
take
our
best
shot
at
what
the
meaning
of
that
language
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
in
other
instances
where
congress
has
wanted
an
overt
act,
it's
said
it.
in
this
instance,
it
didn't
say
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
look
at
me
when
you
say
that?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
ninth
circuit
hold
that
any
other
elements
of
any
other
crimes
need
not
be
alleged
in
the
indictment
but
must
be
proven?
justice
antonin
scalia
notice
pleading
for
criminal
offenses?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
riordan,
what
federal
criminal
statutes
do
define
crime?
my
impression
is,
all
of
them
just
say
whoever
commits
this
shall
be
punished
by
that.
i
mean,
this
is
not
an
unusual
statute
in
that
it,
as
you
say,
it
does
not
define
the
crime.
most
federal
statutes
read
like
this,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
use
a
common
law
term
and
say,
the
punishment
shall
be
thus,
or
a
common
sensical
term.
