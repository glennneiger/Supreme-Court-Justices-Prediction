mr.
seamon,
is
it
necessary
to
prove
an
overt
act
to
establish
venue
in
a
particular
district
where
the
case
is
brought?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
have
to
prove
it,
even
if
you
don't
have
to
allege
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
normally
does,
yes--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--couldn't
the
formation
of
the
conspiracy
establish
the
venue,
that
the
conspirators
convened
at
a
particular
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
riordan,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
is
it
your
view
that
the
overt
act
must
be
alleged
in
the
indictment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
has
to
be
an
instruction.
the
error
here
was
a
failure
to
give
the
instruction.
the
indictment
was
sufficient,
according
to
them.
