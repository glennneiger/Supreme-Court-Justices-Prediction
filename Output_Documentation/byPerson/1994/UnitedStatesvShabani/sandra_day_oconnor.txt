mr.
seamon,
in
the
felix
case,
i
guess
justice
stevens
in
his
separate
concurrence
argued
that
the
overt
acts
didn't
establish
an
essential
element
of
the
conspiracy,
and
the
majority
opinion
did
not
seem
to
accept
that
view
as
expressed
by
justice
stevens.
is
that
something
we're
going
to
have
to
explain
if
we
agree
with
you
on
this
interpretation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
we
took
the
case
to
resolve
rather
a
lopsided
conflict
among
the
courts
of
appeals.
in
the
opinion
filed
today
we
hold
that
the
drug
conspiracy
statute
ยง
21
u.
s.
c.
ยง
846
does
not
require
the
government
to
prove
that
a
conspirator
under
the
drug
conspiracy
law
has
committed
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
unlike
the
general
conspiracy
statute
ยง
846
follows
the
common
law
definition
of
conspiracy
which
requires
only
that
the
conspirators
enter
into
an
agreement
to
commit
an
unlawful
act.
accordingly
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
