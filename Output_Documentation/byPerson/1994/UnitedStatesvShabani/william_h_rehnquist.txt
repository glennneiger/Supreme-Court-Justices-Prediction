chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
93-981,
united
states
v.
reshat
shabani.
mr.
seamon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
regard
the
comparison
of
371
with
the
language
of
846
as
being
legislative
history?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
at
least
you
have
in
846
a
prohibition
against
conspiracy
which
says
nothing
about
an
overt
act,
and
you
have
in
371
a
prohibition
against
conspiracy
which
does
require
an
overt
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
371
doesn't
define
conspiracy,
either.
i
mean,
neither--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--of
the
two
statutes
we're
talking
about
purport
to
define
the
offense
of
conspiracy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you're
also
faced
with
the
question
why
congress
required
an
overt
act
in
371
and
why
congress
didn't
require
an
overt
act
in
846.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
reason
is
there
to
think
that
congress
thought
about
it
in
1867
and
put
in
the
overt
act,
but
didn't
think
about
it
in
1970?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
always
has
the
option
to
correct
it
the
other
way
if
we
rule
against
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
also
have
nash
and
singer,
which
say
otherwise
with
respect
to
different
kinds
of
statutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
did
say
in
the
nash
case
that
an
overt
act
was
not
required
to
support
a
conspiracy
conviction
under
the
sherman
act,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why,
then,
is
it
a
thin
read?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
difference
does
it
make
whether...
the
particular
substantive
offenses
that
we're
talking
about?
i
mean,
there
probably
weren't
any
prohibitions
against
the
use
of
drugs
in
1611,
if
you're
talking
about
traditional
statutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
which
time
the
congress
had
the
singer
and
the
nash
precedents
which
it
could
have
relied
on.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say,
then,
that
congress,
in
order
to
rely
on
the
singer
and
nash
precedents
in
drafting
a
statute,
must
say,
either
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
statute,
we're
relying
on
these
precedents,
rather
than
simply
following
what
they
suggest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
would
have
read
the
cases
you're
referring
to
and
seen
that
those
cases
originated
out
of
a
statute,
which
itself
required
an
overt
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
they
not
have?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
the
one
that
began
fantasizing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
not
saying
it's
any
different
than
371
in
that
respect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
846
is
a
statute
that
doesn't
purport
to
define
conspiracy,
it
just
sets
penalties.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
suggesting
that
in
that
respect
it's
any
different
from
371,
are
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
explaining
now
why
you
think
846
is
different
from
371?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
that
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
what
makes
you
think
they
were
focusing
on
the
elements
of
conspiracy
in
371?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
riordan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
seamon.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
93-981,
united
states
against
shabani
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
