i
do
have
a
question,
actually.
what
do
you
say
in
response
to
mr.
riordan's
argument?
that
is,
i
take
his
argument
basically
to
be
that
by
the
time
this
particular
statute
was
passed,
846,
by
that
time
in
1970
it
had
become
fairly
widely
accepted
practice
that,
in
the
federal
law,
conspiracy
included
overt
acts.
indeed,
the
only
exceptions
to
that
were
really
criminal
provisions
that
aren't
even
printed
in
what
we
think
of
as
the
criminal
section
of
the
u.s.
code,
18,
21,
26,
et
cetera,
but
rather,
sort
of
outliers,
the
sherman
act,
which
isn't
in
the
west
publishing
thing,
the
selective
service
act,
and
so
by
that
time
anyone
who
was
a
drafter
would
have
thought,
of
course
it
includes
an
overt
act
when
we
use
that
word
conspiracy.
indeed,
this
particular
statute
doesn't
define
a
crime.
it
seems
to
refer
back
to
371.
it
just
says,
those
who
commit
this
kind
of
offense
shall
have
the
same
penalties,
et
cetera,
and
so
at
least
the
matter
is
ambiguous.
after
all,
a
drafter
would
have
looked
far
and
wide
for
any
other
normal
criminal
section
with
conspiracy
if
it
didn't
include
overt
act.
i
mean,
that's,
i
think
that's
his
argument,
so
that's
at
least
a
good
enough
argument
to
invoke
the
rule
of
lenity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
your
specific
response
to
that?
maybe
you've
made
it
already
and
you'd
just
be
repeating
yourself,
in
which
case,
i
don't
want
you
to
repeat
yourself,
but
i
wanted
you
to
have
a
chance
to
focus
directly.
