mr.
richard
h.
seamon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
concerns
the
federal
drug
conspiracy
statute
which
is
codified
as
section
846,
title
21
of
the
u.s.
code.
respondent
was
indicted
by
a
federal
grand
jury
in
the
district
of
alaska
on
one
count
of
violating
section
846
by
conspiring
to
distribute
cocaine
in
alaska.
the
indictment
did
not
allege
that
respondent
or
any
of
his
coconspirators
committed
any
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
respondent
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
government
is
required,
in
a
prosecution
under
846,
to
allege
and
prove
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
the
district
court
denied
that
motion,
and
subsequently,
at
the
close
of
the
evidence
at
trial,
the
court
denied
respondent's
request
to
instruct
the
jury
that
the
government
was
required
to
prove
an
overt
act.
the
jury
found
respondent
guilty,
but
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
his
conviction.
it
held
that
the
government
is
required
by
section
846
to
prove
that
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
was
committed.
that
holding
conflicts
with
the
holdings
of
all
eleven
other
regional
courts
of
appeals.
the
government
brought
the
case
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
question
presented
is
whether
section
846
requires
proof
of
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
in
our
view,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
section
846
does
not
require
such
proof,
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
text
of
section
846
does
not
expressly
require
proof
of
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy,
and
in
contrast,
many
other
federal
conspiracy
statutes,
including
the
general
conspiracy
statute,
do
expressly
require
such
proof.
in
light
of
the
many
federal
statutes
that
set
forth
the
requirement
expressly,
section
846
cannot
be
construed
to
impose
the
requirement
by
implication.
second,
in
united
states
v.
singer,
this
court
upheld
the
conviction
under
a
conspiracy
statute
that
the
court
construed
not
to
require
proof
of
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
singer
in
an
earlier
decision--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--no,
justice
o'connor.
the
majority
opinion
in
felix
simply
didn't
address
this
question
of
statutory
interpretation
presented
here.
felix
was
a
double
jeopardy
case,
and
both
courts
agreed
in
this
court
that
section
846
doesn't
require
proof
of
an
overt
act,
and
the
case
was
litigated
in
this
court
on
that
assumption.
furthermore,
the
court
of
appeals
in
felix,
even
though
it
decided
the
double
jeopardy
issue
against
us,
also
recognized
that
section
846
doesn't
require
proof
of
an
overt
act,
therefore
the
majority's
opinion
in
felix
was
directed
at
explaining
why,
although
a
broad
reading
of
grady
might
have
barred
the
prosecution,
it
was
rejecting
that
broad
reading.
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
do
control
here
are
nash
and
singer.
those
decisions
not
only
construe
a
conspiracy
statute
that
is
silent
on
the
question
not
to
require
proof
of
an
overt
act,
but
they
apply
a
rule
of
statutory
interpretation
that
fully
applies
here.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
is
correct
that
overt
acts
were
proven
in
this
case,
and
that
as
a
general
matter
they
won't
be
difficult
to
prove
in
a
conspiracy
case.
in
the...
the
prosecutor
examined
the
state
of
the
law
and
concluded
that
proof
of
an
overt
act
wasn't
an
essential
element
of
the
crime
and
therefore
didn't
have
to
be
alleged
in
the
indictment.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
actually
the
district
court
that
first
raised
the
question
of
whether
an
overt
act
needed
to
be
alleged,
and
it
determined
that
one
didn't
need
to
be.
therefore,
the
district
court
submitted
the
case
to
the
jury
without
instructing
it
that
it
was
required
to
prove
an
overt
act.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
that's
correct.
he
could
have
done
so,
and
he
chose
not
to,
because
after
studying
the
law
on
this
particular
point,
he
concluded
that
section
846
doesn't
require
proof
of
an
overt
act.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
actually,
the
prosecutor
who
brought
the
charge
was
different
from
the
prosecutor
who
tried
the
case.
she
tried
the
case,
and
it
was
he
who
brought
the
charge.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
if
the
district
court
had
concluded
that
an
overt
act
was
an
essential
element,
the
government
would
have
had
to
reindict,
so
it
wasn't
quite
as
simple
a
matter
as
simply
amending
the
indictment,
and
in--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes.
the
burden
is
on
the...
to
establish
venue
and
one
way
in
a
conspiracy
case
to
do
that
is
by
alleging
an
overt
act
in--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it
does
have
to
be
proven
if
it's
a
matter
of
dispute.
now...
and
as
a
matter
of
practice,
prosecutors
typically
do--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--allege
something
to
establish
venue,
and
the
question
here--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
venue
can
be
established
either
by
the
commission
of
an
overt
act
in
the
district
where
the
prosecution
is
brought,
or
the
formation
of
the
conspiracy
in
that
district.
the
question
here
really
doesn't
have
to
do
so
much
with
whether
the
prosecutor
could
have
alleged
and
proven
an
overt
act,
because
overt
acts
were
proven,
but
the
question
is
whether
conduct
that
congress
has
made
a
crime
can
be
punished
in
the
ninth
circuit,
as
it
can
be
in
every
other
circuit
of
the
country.
as
this
shows,
the
government
has
lost
what
it
considers
to
be
valid
convictions
because
of
the
ninth
circuit's
erroneous
view
of
the
law.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i'm
sure
that's
the
way
our
opponent
would
phrase
the
question.
[laughter]
the...
and
our
primary
argument
is
based
on
the
text
of
section
846,
which...
and
congress'
intent
in
enacting
that
statute.
the
text
of
section
846
is
set
out
in
relevant
part
on
page
9
of
our
opening
brief
on
the
merits,
and
page
9
also
sets
out
the
general
conspiracy
statute
with
which
it
is
useful
to
compare
section
846.
section
846
is
at
the
top
of
page
9.
it
does
not
expressly
require
proof
of
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
it
punishes
"any
person
who
conspires
to
commit
any
offense.
"
defined
in
the
subchapter
proscribing
various
drug
offenses.
in
contrast,
the
general
conspiracy
statute,
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
9
of
our
brief,
does
expressly
require
proof
of
an
overt
act.
it
makes
it
illegal,
in
relevant
part,
"if
two
or
more
persons
conspire
to
commit
any
offense
against
the
united
states
and
do
any
act
to
effect
the
object
of
the
conspiracy.
"
that
language
in
the
general
conspiracy
statute,
referring
to
an
act
to
effect
the
object
of
the
conspiracy,
shows
that
congress
understood
that
an
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
is
separate
and
distinct
from
the
conspiracy
itself.
thus,
under
the
general
conspiracy
statute,
the
overt
act
requirement
is
not
implicit
in
the
term
"conspires".
it
is
spelled
out
in
separate
language
that
specifically
refers
to
the
act.
the
term
846,
and
there,
too,
the
term
should
not
be
construed
to
contain
an
overt
act
by
implication.
such
a
construction
would
be
especially
unjustified
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
are
other
federal
conspiracy
statutes
in
which
congress
used
express
language
to
require
proof
of
an
overt
act.
the
construction
of
section
846
that
we're
urging
also
is
compelled,
i
think,
by
the
court's
decisions
in
nash
and
singer.
in
both
nash
and
singer,
the
defendant
was
charged
with
a
conspiracy
under
an
indictment
that
did
not
allege
any
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
in
both
cases,
the
defendant
argued
in
this
court
that
the
indictment
was
defective
because
of
its
failure
to
allege
an
overt
act
and,
in
each
case,
this
court
rejected
the
argument
because
the
statute
under
which
the
defendant
was
charged
did
not
expressly
require
proof
of
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
the
court
explained
that
because
the
statute
was
silent
as
to
overt
acts,
it
punished
conspiracies
"on
the
common
law
footing",
which
is
to
say,
without
requiring
proof
of
an
overt
act.
nash
and
singer
provide
guidance
here
in
two
ways.
they
give
guidance
to
the
court
in
interpreting
conspiracy
statutes
that
are
silent
as
to
overt
acts,
and
they
give
guidance
to
congress
by
providing
a
blueprint
for
it
to
follow
when
drafting
a
conspiracy
statute,
because
they
make
it
clear
that
if
congress
wants
to
require
proof
of
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy,
it
has
to
say
so
expressly.
if
it
does
not,
the
statute
will
be
construed
not
to
require
such
proof.
and
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
congress
followed
the
blueprint
laid
out
in
nash
and
singer,
because
nash
and
singer
were
on
the
books
both
when
congress
enacted
the
earliest
drug
conspiracy
statute
and
when
it
enacted
section
846,
and
their
validity
has
never
been
called
into
question
by
this
court.
nash
and
singer
support
our
position
in
another
way.
they
apply
a
rule
of
statutory
interpretation
that
applies
here.
the
rule
is
that,
when
congress
uses
a
common
law
term,
the
court
presumes,
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
the
contrary,
that
congress
intended
the
term
to
have
its
common
law
meaning.
at
common
law,
as
the
court
said
in
nash
and
singer,
proof
of
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
was
not
necessary
to
establish
the
conspiracy,
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
congress
intended
to
depart
from
the
common
law
in
punishing
drug
conspiracies.
now,
respondent
questions
whether
nash
and
singer
understood
the
common
law
of
conspiracy
correctly,
but
in
a
sense,
the
question
is
beside
the
point.
the
point
is
that
nash
and
singer
were
on
the
books
when
congress
enacted
the
federal
drug
conspiracy
statutes,
and
their
understanding
of
the
common
law
had
not
been
called
into
question
up
to
that
point,
or
for
that
matter
at
any
point
later,
for
example,
when
congress
enacted
section
846
in
1970.
thus,
nash
and
singer
furnish
the
background
rule
for
congress
in
drafting
the
conspiracy
statutes,
and
they
should
also
apply
the
background
rule
for
interpreting
the
statute.
respondent's
other
argument
is
that
nash
and
singer
represented,
to
use
his
term,
an
illadvised
expansion
of
conspiracy
law,
but
nash
and
singer
didn't
break
any
new
ground.
each
began
with
the
recognition
that
at
common
law
it
was
not
necessary
to
prove
an
overt
act,
and
that
principle
had
been
recognized
by
this
court
as
early
as
1879
in
united
states
v.
hirsch,
and
it
was
reaffirmed
in
a
decision
that
was
issued
just
a
few
months
before
congress
enacted
the
first
federal
drug
conspiracy
statute.
based
on
their
understanding
of
the
common
law,
nash
and
singer
applied
the
rule
of
statutory
interpretation
concerning
congress'
use
of
a
common
law
term.
that
rule,
likewise,
had
been
applied
in
many
earlier
and
later
decisions.
in
short,
this
court
has
never
disavowed
nash
or
singer
or
the
principles
underlying
them,
and
so
respondent
cannot
bear
his
burden
of
explaining
why
the
court
should
not
follow
nash
and
singer
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--thank
you.
although
the
court
has
focused
on
371,
the
general
conspiracy
statute
which
was
enacted
in
1867,
there
were
many
subsequent
statutes
that
expressly
require
proof
of
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
in
so
many
words,
including
a
number
of
statutes
that
were
on
the
books
in
1970
when
congress
enacted
section
846.
those
statutes
are
evidence
that
the
word
conspire
did
not
change
to
include
implicitly
an
overt
act
element.
i
thank
the
court.
