isn't
this
an
effort
by
congress
to
restore
a
doctrine
that
this
court
abandoned,
that
is,
the
double
whammy
of
lampf
and
beam?
congress
is
saying,
for
this
class
of
plaintiffs
we
are
ordering
the
court
to
go
back
to
chevron
oil
v.
huson?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
you
have
no
question
that
if
one
of
these
cases
is
still
pending,
if
an
appeal
were
lodged
after
lampf
and
beam,
and
it
was
just
sitting
there,
that
that
case
could
go
forward?
take
two
plaintiffs
identically
situated,
one
gets
the
word
from
lampf
and
beam
and
says,
i
give
up.
the
other
one
says,
although
it's
hopeless,
i'm
going
to
file
an
appeal,
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
backlogged,
i'm
going
to
let
it
languish.
that
person
has
a
good
claim
that
could
still
go
forward.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
understand
you
better
you
what
you
said.
you
are
not
conceding
that
the
legislature
could
not
extend,
while
a
case
is
still
alive,
could
not
extend
the
statute
of
limitations.
isn't
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
time
in
which
a
claim
is
alive,
a
peculiarly
legislative
function?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
there
are...
there
are
many
cases
where
a
statute
of
limitations
is
extended
while
the
claim
is
still
alive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose...
let's
take
this
case,
and
congress
had
reacted
to
lampf
and
said,
we
don't
think
it
should
be
the
90
limit,
we
think
it
should
be
a
5-year
limit,
so
we're
enacting
a
5-year
limit,
and
it
applies
to
all
cases
to
which
it
could
lawfully
apply.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
just
trying
to
get
an
answer
from
you
about
congress'
power.
we've
been
concentrating
on
the
court's
power.
it
was
my
understanding
that
congress
could
extend
the
statute
of
limitations,
that
there
wasn't
any
question
about
that,
and
that
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
a
final
judgment
and
some
people
were
placed
out
of
court,
some
people
were
still
in
court.
i
don't
understand
the
problem
that
you're
suggesting
that
exists.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
is
there
any
relevance
at
all
to
the
fact
that
no
rights
about
the
conduct,
whether
there
was
a
fraud,
whether
there
wasn't,
involved
here,
the
only
question
resolved
was
whether
the
case
was
brought
on
time,
and
so
we're
not
dealing
with
what
did
the
parties
do
and
was
it
proper
under
the
law,
but
simply,
how
much
time
was
there
to
open
the
court's
door?
that
was
the
only
question
at
issue,
and
that
is
a
determination
that
i
think
you
would
concede,
how
much
time
do
you
have
to
sue,
is
for
the
legislature
to
decide.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
you
for
the
10(b)
right
and,
indeed,
all
other
rights
that
congress
creates
or
that
this
court
says
we
should
imply.
isn't
it
for
the
legislature
and
not
for
the
court
to
say
how
much
time
someone
has
to
knock
on
the
court's
door?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
weren't
we...
whatever
limitation
period
we
were
constructing
in
lampf,
it
was
an
endeavor
to
determine
what
congress
meant.
we
were
not
dealing
with
some
judicial
notion
of
laches.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
was,
we
recognize
that
congress
has
the
power
to
set
time
limits.
there
isn't
any
question
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying,
mr.
olson,
that
congress
could
do
more
but
not
less,
unless...
i
thought
you
said
in
answer
to
my
question,
suppose
congress
said
we
don't
like
3
years,
we're
going
to
make
it
5,
and
everybody
would
cover...
be
covered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
congress,
reacting
to
our
lampf
decision,
says,
we
think
5
years
is
a
reasonable
time.
we
also
think
there
are
many
people
who
have
a
reliance
interest
in
what
they
thought
the
law
was,
they
proved
to
be
wrong,
so
we
want
to
cover
those
people,
treat
them
in
the
way
we're
treating
the
people
that
we
are
legislating
for,
as
we
have
a
right
to
do.
we
want
everybody
to
have
5
years,
and
that
includes
people
with
cases
pending,
people
who
have
been...
whose
actions
have
been
dismissed,
and
people
who
are
filing
their
complaints
today.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
tell
me
what
congress
could
do
if
congress
is
of
a
mind
that
it
wants
to
enlarge
the
time
that
people
can
bring
this
10(b)
claim,
and
it
wants
to
cover
as
many
people
as
possible--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
says,
we
know...
one
thing
that
we
do
know
is
our
prerogative
to
set
time
limits
for
the
bringing
of
federal
actions.
you
said
there's
a
right
way
and
a
there's
a
wrong
way.
what
is
the
right
way
for
congress
to
accomplish
that
objective
of
getting
as
many
people
in
under
what
it
thinks
is
the
proper
time
limit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
just
wanted
to
know
if
you
could
tell
me
what
was
the
right
way.
you
have
said
that
this
way
is
the
wrong
way.
i
don't
see--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
your
answer
so
far
that
there
is
any
right
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
congress
can
deal
with
from
this
day
forward
but
not
for
the
past.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
you
think
there
is
no
way
in
your
argument,
not
that
congress...
there
was
a
right
way
but
congress--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
there's
really
no
middle
way,
in
for
a
calf,
in
for
a
cow.
lampf
is
and
was
the
law,
even
if
a
lot
of
people
thought
it
wasn't.
you
have
to
go
all
the
way
down
that
line.
there's
no
possible
compromise.
