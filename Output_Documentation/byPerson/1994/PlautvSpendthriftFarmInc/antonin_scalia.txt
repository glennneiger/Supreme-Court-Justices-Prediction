justice
antonin
scalia
which
are
you
calling
which?
the
one
where
there's
no
further
review
possible
you're
going
to
call
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
certainly
not
what
sioux
nation
said.
i
mean,
the
case's
own
description
of
its
holding
does
refer
to
separation
of
powers.
it
says
that
congress'...
this
is
a
quote...
"mere
waiver
of
the
res
judicata
effect
of
a
prior
judicial
decision
rejecting
the
validity
of
a
legal
claim
against
the
united
states
does
not
violate
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers.
"
so
we
were
using
simply
a
waiver
of
res
judicata
by
the
government
as
a
vindication
of
the
separation
of
powers
validity
of
the
case.
now,
you
may
persuade
us
that's
wrong,
but
that's
at
least
what
we
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
suggest
an
institutional
interest.
there
are
things
that
the
president
can
do
which
neither
congress
nor
this
court
can
affect.
it's
his
call.
what
he
says
goes.
there
are
things
that
congress
can
do
that
neither
the
president
nor
the
courts
can
affect,
and
what
congress
says
goes.
i
have
always
thought
that
the
same
applied
to
the
third
independent
branch
of
government.
there
are
some
things
that
the
courts
do
that
neither
congress
nor
the
president
can
affect,
but
you're
telling
me
no,
that
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
can...
you
can
issue
an
opinion,
but
ultimately
they
can
send
it
back
and
say,
do
it
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can
create
whole
new
rights,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
the
due
process
clause
didn't
prevent
it,
it
could
retroactively
create
a
new
right.
now,
i
think
you
would
come
up
with
some
due
process
problems
if
you
did
that,
but
short
of
those
due
process...
it
can
do
that,
but
it
didn't
do
that
here.
it
wants
the
court
to
repronounce
the
prior
right
which
it
said
no
longer
existed.
the
court
said,
finally
and
ultimately,
this
right
does
not
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
problem.
i
think
you're
absolutely
right,
but
i
think
you'd
come
flat
up
against
the
brick
wall
of
due
process.
i
don't
think
you
could
create
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
that
can't
be
it.
i
mean,
the
executive
does
that
all
the
time.
administrative
law
judges
apply
to
law
to
the
facts
and
come
out
with
a
decision
all
the
time.
congress
used
to
do
it
before
there
was
a
claims
court.
it
used
to
consider
the
facts
of
law
and
come
up
all
the
time...
applying
facts
to
law
and
coming
up
with
a
decision
is
not
the
essence
of
the
judicial
function.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
two
branches
do
that
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you've
got
to
come
up
with
something
else
that
makes
us
different.
i
had
thought
it
was
the
fact
that
we
could
render
final
decisions,
but
you
tell
me
that's
not
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
rule--
--well,
furthermore,
i--
--a
rule
suggested
by
the
separation
of
powers.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
we
announce
in
lampf
that
we
were
changing
the
law?
did
we
say
that
the
law
used
to
be
differently
but
from
today
on,
we,
the
supreme
court,
are
changing
it?
is
that
what
we
did?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
we
pronounced
the
law
was
this
way
and
had
always
been
this
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you're
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma.
if
you
must
reopen
under
60(b)
you
violate
the
separation
of
powers
because
it's
the
same
thing
as
a
mandate.
if
you
have
the
option
to
reopen
or
not
reopen,
i
can't
imagine
it
wouldn't
violate
due
process.
a
court
can
either
take
account
of
the
congressional
change
of
law,
or
not
take
account
of
it
as
the
court
sees
fit.
if
that's
due
process,
i
don't...
if
that
isn't
a
violation
of
due
process,
i
don't
know
what
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
there
is
no
right
way.
is
there
a
possibility
that
there
is
no
right
way
to
overturn
a
judicial
decision--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
adjudicated
private--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
a
possibility?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
say
that.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--fraudulent
judgments
are
invalid
judgments.
justice
antonin
scalia
stupid
judgments
are
not
invalid
judgments,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
distinction.

this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit.
in
a
civil
action
brought
1987,
petitioners
alleged
that
in
1983
and
1984
respondents
had
committed
fraud
and
deceit
in
the
sale
of
stock
in
violation
of
federal
securities
laws.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
action
following
this
court's
decision
in
a
case
called
lamp.
the
effect
of
which
was
to
make
petitioner’s
suit
time
barred.
after
the
judgment
became
final
congress
enacted
§27a
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
which
is
the
provision
at
issue
here.
it
provides
through
reinstatement
on
the
plaintiff’s
motion
on
the
any
action
commenced
before
lamp
was
decided
but
dismissed
after
lamp
as
time
barred.
if
the
date
of
filing
of
that
action
no
late
under
lamp
would
have
been
timely
under
applicable
state
law
which
is
what
some
lower
federal
courts
had
been
using
as
the
standard
before
we
decided
lamp.
petitioners
move
to
reopen
their
case
under
the
statute,
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
on
the
ground
that
§27a
(b)
is
unconstitutional.
the
united

court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
that.

justice
not
participating
in
the
similar
case

v.

life
ins.

at
that
time,
we
were
equally
divided
on
the
outcome
of
the
case
so
according
to
custom
we
affirm
the
judgment
under
review
without
opinion.
we
granted
certiorari
in
the
present
case
to
consider
the
question
again
with
full
court.
we
hold
today
that
§27a

violates
the

because
it
requires

to
reopen

in

as
the

but
conclusively
to

history
makes
clear
that
the
right
against
which
the
constitution
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
was
meant
to
protect
was
not
merely
legislative
reversal
of
judicial
judgments
but
also
legislative
setting
aside
of
judicial
judgments.
in
the
17th
and
18th
centuries
colonial
assemblies
and
legislatures
often
vacated
final
judgments
and
the
populism
that
swept
the
country
during
the
revolution
increased
the
frequency
of
that
practice.
the
period
from
about
1780
to
1787
saw
a
reaction
against
these
developments
and
a
sense
of
sharp
necessity
to
separate
the
legislative
from
the
judicial
power
motivated
the
framers
of
the
new
federal
constitution.

petitioners
are
correct
that
congress
can
always
revise
the
judgment
of
a
lower
article
iii
court
in
one
sentence.
when
a
new
law

the

the
last

to

not
