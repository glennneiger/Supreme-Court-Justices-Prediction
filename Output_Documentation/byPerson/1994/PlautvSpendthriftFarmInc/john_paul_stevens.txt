justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
olson,
because
i'm
not
quite
sure
of
either
your
opponent's
view
or
your
view
on
this.
supposing,
going
back
to
the
aiding
and
abetting
business
and
the
other
case,
supposing
congress
today
passed
a
statute
authorizing
a
cause
of
action
for
aiding
and
abetting
a
10b-5
violation
and
said,
it
shall
be
brought...
applied
a
case
that's
10
years...
arose
10
years
ago.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
have,
or
would
not
have?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
really
understand
what
he
was
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
let's...
why
don't
i
just
ask
what
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
prior
case...
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
10b-5
case
we
had
before
was
that
there
simply
is
no
such
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
why
does
such
a
holding
prevent
congress
from
creating
such
a
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
that
be
equally
true
if
there'd
been
no
case
in
this
court
in
the
meantime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
congress
can't
create
a
10-year-old
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
a
statute
allowing
setting
aside
of
a
judgment
obtained
by
fraud
or
by
bribery
or
something
like
that
could
not
obtain
final...
authorize
the
setting
aside
of
final
judgments?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
it
get
that
power--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
that
just
the
limit
of
its
power?
it
only
can
do
it
where
there's
fraud?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
judge
was
hypnotized
for
that
class
of
cases.
[laughter]
could
they
set
aside
all
judgments
in
which
judges
over
90
years
old
were
hypnotized
and
gave...
presumably
gave
a
stupid
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
forget
60(b).
could
they
pass
such
a
statute
for
a
limited
class
of
judgments
that
they
detected
created...
they
thought
created
a
very--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--special
doubt
about--
justice
john
paul
stevens
some
people
think
the
lampf
case
reversed
the
roles
of
congress
and
the
courts,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
some
of
us.
[laughter]
unkind
of
you
to
point
that
out.
