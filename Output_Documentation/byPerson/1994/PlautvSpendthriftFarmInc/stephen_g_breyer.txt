justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
congress
did
not
pass
a
statute
of
limitations
for
the
future,
did
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
i've
a
human
question,
rather
than
an
institutional
one.
i'd
always
thought
that
the
human
purpose
underlying
separation
of
powers
was
to
prevent
what
i'd
call
a
vendetta,
where
one
group
of
people
decide
to
pass
a
law,
then
apply
it,
then
adjudicate
it
as
well.
now,
why
isn't
this
one
of
the
strongest
cases
of
vendetta
one
can
imagine,
an
unpopular,
small
group
of
people
who,
in
fact,
are
affected
by
a
law
that
applies
to
no
one
else,
that
does
not
apply
to
the
future
and
therefore
doesn't
affect
general
policy,
and
is
retroactive,
and
reopens
a
closed
judgment
by
a
court?
if
there's
a
stronger
example
of
a
vendetta,
i'd
like
to
know
it.
i
mean,
that's
what
i'm
concerned
about
in
terms
of
the
policy
underlying
separation
of
powers,
and
i
guess
if
they're
taking
away
money
from
somebody,
as
i
suppose
they
are,
why
isn't
that
also
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
has
any
effect
at
all,
it
takes
away
money,
otherwise
its
null
and
void,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
it
has
no
effect...
nobody
cares
about
the
cases
where
the
plaintiffs
are
going
to
lose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
it's
also
because
somebody
reopened
a
statute
of
limitations
in
a
closed
case.
i'm
not...
i'm
telling
you...
i'm
saying
this
to
put
forth
as
succinctly
as
possible
what's
bothering
me
about
the
case.
then
i'm
interested
in
what
your
response
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
mean
abstractly
fair.
maybe
that's
a
loaded
word,
by...
i
put
that
in
quotes.
i
simply
mean,
by
a
group
of
people
who
are
legislators
assuming
functions
that
normally
would
be
carried
out
by
other
branches,
the
separation
of
powers
being
a
guarantee
that
there
will
not
be
aiming
at
these
particular
persons
in
a
way
that
normally
involves
functions
of
other
branches.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does
seem
to
me
we
have
to
assume,
for
your
argument,
that
this
is
all
quite
fair
and
reasonable,
that
what
the
court
did
in
its
prior
opinion
was
a
surprise,
that
it
did
not
declare
what
the
law
had
been
but,
rather,
that
it
changed
law,
and
then
i'm
rather
stuck
as
to
how
you
can
say...
how
this
court
could
say
that,
unless
it
said
it
in
the
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
is
that
the
key,
because
if
the...
if...
i
mean,
is
it...
does
it
violate
separation
of
powers
always,
to
open
up
a
closed
judgment?
i
mean,
suppose
that
congress
wanted
to
change
one
of
its
tort
statutes
for
the
future.
it
said,
6
months
is
too
short,
we
want
2
years,
and
the
statute
says
it's
2
years
for
everybody,
and
then
it
says,
apply
this
2-year
statute
to
closed
cases
insofar
as
due
process
allows.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that
would
focus
it,
because
insofar
as
due
process
allows,
you
can't
do
it,
but
now,
is
there
any
objection
to
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--this
is
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
legislation
is
a
class.
you
see,
everybody's
thrown
into
it.
you
have...
what
i'm
thinking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
everybody,
and
now
you're
saying
that
separation
of
powers
stops
that
legislation
applying
to
a
person
with
a
closed
judgment
even
if
it
doesn't
violate
the
due
process
clause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because...
it
does
that
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
see
what
i'm
trying
to
think
of.
not...
i'm
trying
to
get
the
due
process
out
of
it,
and
they're
not
focusing
on
an
individual
case,
and
they're
not
intending
to
do
anything
but
as
a
class
treat
everybody
alike,
past,
present,
and
future.
so
they're
not
examining
the
judgment,
they're
doing
nothing
but
general
legislation.
what
separation
of
powers
principle
bars
that,
if
due
process
doesn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
what
they
do
is,
they
say,
don't
open
it,
we're
giving
all
those
people
a
new
cause
of
action.
