justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
congress
changed
the
statute
of
limitations
and
then
added
a
second
clause
which
said,
res
judicata
shall
not
apply
in
any
10b-5
case
that
has
been
commenced
after
a
certain
date,
and
sets
that
date
5
years
back,
so
that
all
cases
can
be
reopened
if
they've
been
filed
within
5
years.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
just
a
question
of
straining
our
resources?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
the
whole
story
that
the
judgments
of
this
court
and
of
the
article
iii
courts
ought
to
be
rendered
without
fear
of
their
being
corrected
in
a
supervisorial
way
by
the
political
branches?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
your
answer
to
justice
souter,
you
indicated
that
it
would
be
in
that
hypothetical
that
you
put,
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
apply
the
new
law,
but
that
means
that
the
law
is,
in
itself,
a
mandate
to
reopen.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
don't
see
how
you've
cured
the
problem.
