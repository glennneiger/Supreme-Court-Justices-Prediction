justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
this
court
ever
upheld
a
legislative
invalidation
of
final
judgments
of
an
article
iii
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
in
sioux
nation
it
involved
the
government
and
the
opinion
of
this
court
at
least
said
congress
did
not
interfere
with
the
finality
of
the
court
of
claims
judgments
and
went
on
to
justify
it
on
the
theory
that
a
new
action
had
been
created,
so
how
does
that
support
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
olson,
could
congress
have
created
a
new
cause
of
action
somehow
and
waived
any
res
judicata
effect
of
prior--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
would
that
be
a
separation
of
powers
problem
as
applied
to
individuals,
or
a
due
process
problem.
