david
h.

mr.
dreeben,
let's
assume
that
congress
stopped
right
there,
and
let's
assume
that
it
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
with
respect
to
the,
we'll
call
them
the
blind-sided
plaintiffs
who
suffered
in
the
aftermath
of
lampf,
that
with
respect
to
them
there
was...
the
old
statute
of
limitations
was
reinstated,
and
that,
as
it
were,
by
definition
this
was
intended
to
have
retrospective
effect.
those
plaintiffs
could
then...
if
congress
had
stopped
right
at
that
point,
those
plaintiffs
could
then
have
filed
a
motion
under
rule
60(b),
could
they
not,
for
vacation
of
the
judgments
against
them
and
reinstatement
of
their
causes
of
action
under
the
new
congressional
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
there
have
been
any
invalidity
in
that
ruling?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
there
have
been
a
reason
to
rule
otherwise?
in
other
words,
the
reasoning,
i
suppose,
of
the
courts
would
have
been
that
these
people
were
blind-sided
by
what
we
have
to
accept
was
simply
a
lightening
bolt
of
legal
change,
and
that
therefore
they
have
a
strong
reason
for
equity
on
their
side,
assuming
there
is
no
due
process
problem,
and
i
do
so
assume
in
the
very
fact
of
the
retroactive
effect
of
the
statute.
why
wouldn't
it
have
been
virtually
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
allow
their
reinstatement
if
they
filed
under
rule
60(b)?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
do
we
have
the
option,
then,
in
this
case,
to
say
that
just
as
we
try
to
avoid
the
resolution
generally
of
constitutional
issues
that
we
don't
have
to
reach,
that
what
should
have
occurred
in
the
lower
courts
was
the
consideration
of
applying
rule
60(b)
in
combination
with
the
new
statute
of
limitations
and
not
even
reaching
the
issue
of
whether
congress
itself
can
mandate
the
vacation
of
the
judgment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
assuming
for
the
sake
of
my
question
it
probably
wasn't
made
here,
but
shouldn't
a
court
have
said,
shouldn't
a
trial
court
have
said,
in
effect,
i'm
not
going
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue
unless
you
somehow
tell
me
that
i've
got
to
reach
it
because
we
can't
get
to
the
same
point
by
applying
the
statute,
by
applying
the
statute
of
limitations
under
rule
60(b),
and
shouldn't
the
court
have
done
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
assume
that
there's
no
due
process
problem
in
the
enactment
of
the
new
statute
of
limitations,
then
basically,
doesn't
the
question
of
abuse
of
discretion
turn
on
a
kind
of
traditional
notion
of
equity?
in
other
words,
should
those
who
are
blind-sided
be
given
a
second
chance,
and
if
that
is
in
fact
the
criterion,
is
it
fair
to
say
that
it's
the
mandate
of
congress,
rather
than
the
application
of
a
kind
of
garden
variety
criterion
for
reopening
judgments,
which
is
operative
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
it
didn't
do
that?
what
if
that
last
feature
were--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
would--
--it
would
simply
be
a
60(b)
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
assuming
that
the
retroactive
feature
is
not
a
violation
of
due
process,
assuming
that,
would
there
be
any
separation
of
powers
problems
if
the
courts
simply
acted
under
60(b)?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
always
a
violation
of
due
process
if
two
different
courts
in
effect
view
the
equities
differently?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there,
your
due
process
objection
is
in
effect
to
the
retroactivity
of
a
rule
applied
to
a
class
which
has
already
been
adjudicated,
so
you're
saying,
yes,
there
is
a
due
process
problem
in
effect
in
the
very
notion
of
retroactivity,
because
there
can
only
be
retroactivity
here
to
a
class
which
has
been
subject
to
prior
adjudication.
