mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
questions
from
the
court
have
already
suggested,
this
case
tests
whether
the
ultimate
repository
of
judicial
power
in
the
united
states
shall
rest
with
the
judiciary
or
with
the
congress.
section
27a
is
deceptively
simple,
but
it
is
at
once
a
great
deal
more
and
a
great
deal
less
than
what
its
proponents
claim.
simply
put,
what
it
is
not
is
a
new
statute
of
limitations.
what
it
is,
is
an
instrument
that
directs
article
iii
courts
to
redecide
decided
final
cases
and
it
instructs
them
in
substantial
part,
with
respect
to
an
important
legal
issue
in
those
cases,
exactly
how
they
must
be
decided.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
or
at
least
two
that
come
to
my
mind,
justice
ginsburg.
in
the
first
place,
we
do
not
concede
that
there
wouldn't
be
significant
separation
of
powers
questions
with
respect
to
the
cases
that
are
not
final,
but
we
are
dealing
with
cases
that
are
final.
this
court
made
the
distinction
between
final
cases,
and
has
repeatedly
made
the
distinction
between
final
cases.
to
answer
your
question,
even
assuming
that
the
statute
would
be
constitutional
with
respect
to
the
pending
case,
in
beam,
in
federated
department
stores
v.
moitrie,
if
i'm
pronouncing
that
correctly,
this
court
has
said
that
the
final
line
and
the
importance
of
judicial
power
is
that
distinction
between
when
a
judgment
becomes
final
and
when
it
is
not
final.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i...
we
submit,
or
we
concede
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
a
peculiarly
legislative
area.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
under
some
circumstances,
the
court
has
permitted
that
to
occur.
there
are
limitations,
we
submit.
it
may
depend
on
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
actual
decision
in
a
case
and
where
the
case
is,
and
when...
and
the
extent
to
which
the
rights
of
individuals
are
affected.
the
important
additional--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
the
cases
were
open,
it
would
be,
i
concede,
a
considerably
more
difficult
case.
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
congress
in
this
case
did
not
enact
a
new
statute
of
limitations
at
all.
the
statute
of
limitations
for
buyers
and
sellers
of
securities
is
as
this
court
decided
in
the
lampf
decision.
buyers
and
sellers
of
securities
similarly
situated,
and
the
law
today,
is
the
statute
of
limitations
as
decided
in
lampf.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
submit
that
there
is
a
spectrum,
justice
ginsburg,
that
when
the
congress
of
the
united
states
extends
a
statute
of
limitations,
its
power
is
greater
where
the
cases
have
not
been
brought
or
the
cases
have
not
been
litigated.
if
the
cases
are
already
in
the
litigation
process,
and
decisions
have
been
made
by
article
iii
courts,
and
if
the
congress
is
instructing
the
courts
to
set
aside
those
decisions,
those
raised,
for
me,
separation
of
powers
questions
and
due
process
questions
that
are
not
completely
resolved,
and
they
are
difficult
to
resolve.
they
are
more
difficult
than
if
the
litigation
hasn't
commenced
that
far.
but,
as
i
stress,
that
is
not
this
case.
congress
tried,
or
considered
extending
the
statute
of
limitations
and
enacting
a
new
statute
of
limitations.
in
fact,
it
did
not
have
the
votes
to
do
so.
it
specifically...
its
sponsors
specifically
said,
we
tried
to
change
the
statute
of
limitations
and
we
did
not
have
the
votes
to
do
so,
and
of
course
the
other
distinction
here,
the
distinction
that's
important
to
the
court,
and
important
to
this
court
and
important
under
article
iii,
is
that
there
was
a
final
judgment.
in
short,
what
section
27a
does,
it
has,
even
though
statutes
generally
have
prospective
application,
section
27a
has
only
retrospective
application.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
do
believe,
justice
breyer,
that
as
i
believe
justice
scalia
was
suggesting
in
his
questions,
that
if
there
is
a...
what
the
judicial
power
is
is
to...
and
i
go
back
to
marbury
v.
madison,
is
to
decide
the
rights
of
individuals,
and
that
it
is
fundamental
to
that
judicial
power--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--to
render
final
decisions.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
believe
that
it
may,
justice
breyer.
i
would
refer
your
honor
to--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well...
to
the
decision
of
federated
department
stores
v.
moitrie.
i
hope
i'm
pronouncing
that
right.
it's
the
1982
decision--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--moitie,
excuse
me,
thank
you,
chief
justice...
in
which
the
court...
this
court
considered
that
issue
in
the
context
of
a
judicial
decision
changing
a
rule
of
law
and
efforts
by
parties
then
to
reopen
under
rule
60,
and
i
think
this
may
address
the
question
that
was
raised
by--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
believe
that
if...
the
separation
of
powers
issue
that's
important
there
is
that
decisions
of
article
iii
courts,
when
they
become
final,
finally
adjudicate
the
rights
between
the
parties,
and
even
that
legislation
of
general
application
cannot
set
aside
those
judgments
except
in
extraordinary
circumstances.
we
are
aware
of
no
case--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
think
that
that
would...
that...
it
would
raise
similar
questions
as
the
court...
as
this
court
said
in
the
sioux
nation
case
describing
the
klein
decision
of
the
last
century.
the
limitation
on
jurisdiction,
appellate
jurisdiction,
was
just
a
means
to
an
end.
the
court
would
probably
look
at
that
in
this
similar
context.
i
will
stress,
though,
that
this
case
is
vastly
different
than
that
case,
because
once
we've
looked
at
what
section
27a
does
not
do,
it's
also
important
to
focus
specifically
on
what
section
27a
does
do.
it
applies
only
to
cases,
not
to
persons,
not
to
litigants,
only
plaintiffs
and
defendants.
it
applies
only
to
a
finite
and
identifiable
class
of
plaintiff...
cases,
those
that
were
pending
on
a
certain
day
in
history.
number
3,
it
declares
in
imperative
and
unequivocal
terms
what
courts
must
do
with
those
cases.
they
must--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
it
was
discretion,
if
it
was
a
matter
of
discretion?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
would
be
a--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
think...
i
hadn't
thought
of
it
quite
that
way.
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
a
separation
of
powers
problem
except
that
i
would
again
refer
to
the
federated
department
stores
case
and
the
fact
that
as
far
as
i
could
tell
in
my
research
for
this
argument,
i
have
never
found
a
case
in
which
sections
of
rule
60(b)
was
used
to
set
aside
a
final
judgment
and
to
reinstate
the
rights
of
the
parties
based
upon
a
change
in
the
statute.
i've
never
seen
section--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
because
the...
as
i
understand
this
court's
due
process
jurisprudence,
it
is
an
important
and
essential
difference
to
the
procedural
due
process
of
individuals
when
courts,
acting
according
to
established
procedures,
decide
the
rights
of
individuals
and
litigants.
it's
another
thing
entirely
under
the
due
process
clause
when
a
legislative
body
comes
in
and
attempts
to
redecide,
or
to
decide,
what
the
rights
are
between
individuals,
and
that
is
where
the
due
process
clause
joins
the
separation
of
powers--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
agree
with
that,
but
i
also
feel
that
the
fact
that
it's
the
legislator...
legislature
coming
along
to
redecide
cases
and
redeciding
the
rights
of
individuals,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
justice
souter,
that
would
be
an
additional
answer
that
we
would
submit.
this
statute--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
would
respond
to
that
in
this
way.
in
the
first
place,
the
configurations
of
the
10b-5
remedy
were
for
the
legislature
to
decide,
but
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
lampf,
a
great
deal
has
been
imagined
with
respect
to
the
10(b)
right.
this
court
was
attempting
to--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
except
to
the
extent
that
when
this
court
is
construing
a
legislative
enactment
and
giving
flesh
to
that
legislative
enactment
in
terms
of
when
and
under
what
circumstances
a
private
right
of
action
under
that
enactment
may
be
prosecuted,
this
court
has
imagined
and
attempted
to
discern
what
the
legislature
would
have
done.
mr.
dreeben
in
the
morgan
stanley
argument
last
term,
and
mr.
allen
today,
has
said
that
the
same
result
would
occur
based
upon
their
arguments
if
congress
decided
to
reverse
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
central
bank
of
denver.
the
other
point
that
i
would--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no
question
about
that,
just
in
the
same
way
that
congress
had
the
power
to
decide
whether
aiders
and
abettors
could
recover,
just
as
congress
had
the
power
to
decide
whether
buyers
or
sellers
should
have
a
right
of
action
under
section
10(b).
my
point
in
answer
to
your
question
is
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
not
some
different
species
of
law.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
an
important
part
of
the
judicial
process.
it's
the
part...
and
this
court
in
lampf
decided
that
it
was
a
part
of
the
balancing
process
that
congress
would
have...
the
73rd
congress
would
have
engaged
in
when
it
decided
how
long
people
would
have
the
right
to
bring
an
action.
my
point
is
that
neither
the
government
nor
my
opponent
contends
that
there
would
be
any
difference
in
this
case
if
it
was
the
aiding
and
abetting
defense,
or
the
in
pari
delicto
defense,
or
other
aspects
of
the
section
10(b)
right.
the
other
point
that
i
would
make
is
that
this
was
very
much
like
a
bill
of
attainder.
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
the
members
of
congress
that
addressed
section
27a
were
disturbed
by
and
unhappy
with
this
court's
decision
in
lampf.
they
named
the
plaintiffs
that
they
felt...
by
name,
by
individual
name,
that
they
felt
were
unfairly
deprived
of
their
rights,
they
named
the
defendants
by
name
who
they
said
should
not
benefit
by
their
greed,
and
therefore
the
decision
by
this
court
should
be
set
aside
and,
furthermore,
there
was
considerable
discussion...
it's
impossible
to
tell
how
dispositive
it
was...
that
certain
members
of
congress
were
concerned
about
the
fact
that
it
would
make
it
better
for
the
government
if
more
plaintiffs
won
more
10b-5
cases
because
it
would
cost
the
government
less
in
terms
of
the
savings
and
loan
bailout.
so
that
very
much
like
klein,
and
very
much
opposite
to
the
sioux
nation
decision,
congress
was
requiring
courts
to
set
aside
their
judgments
in
order
to
benefit
the
government,
in
part.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
find
no
decision
from
this
court
that
would
suggest
that
congress
could
do
that
with
respect
to
the
res
judicata
effect
of
prior
decisions
when
individuals
were
involved.
i
recognize
that,
and
to
return
to
the
sioux
nation
point,
in
that
case,
congress
and
the
executive
branch,
the
solicitor
general,
and
this
court,
determined
that
all
that
was
involved
in
the
sioux
nation
case
was
waiving
the
res
judicata
effect
of
a
judgment
against
the
united
states
and
acknowledging
a
debt
that
it
felt,
the
congress
felt
at
the
time
that
statute
was
passed,
it
may
have
owed.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
as
applied
to
individuals,
i
still
think
that
it
could
be
both,
because
i
believe...
this
case
is
somewhat
difficult
to
differentiate
intellectually
from...
the
due
process
aspects
from
the
separation
of
powers
aspects,
because
i
believe
it
may
have
been
justice
breyer's
question
that
focused
on
the
fact
that
the
significant
reason
for
the
separation
of
powers
discussed
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
was
that
if
you
concentrated
power...
or
the
power
of
the
legislature,
the
power
to
make
the
law,
with
the
power
to
enforce
the
law,
with
the
power
to
decide
how
it
would
be
applied,
that
would
be
the
very
definition
of
tyranny,
so
the
separation
of
powers
is
intended
to
protect
individual
rights
just
as
the
due
process
clause
is.
i
believe
that
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata,
the
finality
of
judgments,
is
a
significant
and
fundamental
component
of
the
judicial
power.
it's
also
something
that
exists
to
protect
individuals.
the
summary...
in
summary--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--believe
that
both
of
our
positions
are
clear.
mr.
allen
i
believe
said
in
his
argument
that
he
believed
that
the
congress
would
have
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
believe
that
he
said...
i
hope
i
did
not
mishear.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
thought
that
he
said
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
was
going
to
make
that
point
affirmatively,
that
i
do
not
believe
that
congress
would
have
the
power
to
do
that
to
the
extent
that
the
rights
of
individuals
had
been
adjudicated--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
with...
again,
that
would
become
complicated,
and
i
think
my
answer
is
more
of
a
due
process
answer
than
a
separation
of
powers
answer
to
the
extent
which
the
court
is
deciding
something
that
you
may
be
forced
to
pay
damages
to
someone
for
something
that
you
did
10
years
ago
when
you
didn't
have
to--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
that
i
would
go
back--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that's
part
of
my
answer.
the
other
part
of
my
answer
is
the
answer
that
i
gave
before.
i
think
this
court
would
see
through
it
in
a
moment,
that
what
it
was...
that
legislation
would
be
no
more
than
a
means
to
an
end,
like
the
sioux
nation
court
characterized
the
klein
situation,
that
congress
was
coming
along,
setting
aside
judgments
in
order
to
pick
winners
and
losers
after
the
fact,
and
i
think
that
that
would
bother
this
court
a
great
deal
from
the
standpoint
of
separation
of
powers,
because
it
would
be
a
subterfuge.
this
statute...
it's
interesting,
because
this
statute
embraces
all
of
the
weaknesses
that
one
might
identify
with
this
character
of
legislative
activity.
the
interesting
thing
is
that
what
congress
did
here
is
strip...
what
this
court
customarily
does,
as
articulated
in
marbury
v.
madison,
is
decide
the
rights
of
individuals,
and
decide
cases,
and
decide
how
they
should
come
out,
and
decide
what
the
law
was
when
the
transactions
occur
or
the
conduct
occurred.
congress
has
now
taken
away
all
of
that
effect.
the
rights
of
individuals
are
now
as
decided
by
congress,
but
congress
didn't
change
the
prospective
effect
of
the
lampf
decision,
it
made
the
lampf
decision
into
something
that
didn't
affect
individuals,
it
didn't
affect
plaintiffs
or
defendants
in
the
lampf
case
if
you
uphold
section
27a.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there's
two
answers
to
that.
one,
there's
a
right
way
and
a
wrong
way
for
congress
to
do
similar
things.
chadha
is
an
example
of
that,
although
this
is
certainly
not
at
all
like
chadha,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
congress
under
some
circumstances
can
do
other
things.
what
it
can't
do...
and
that's
about
as
well
as
i
can
do
with
that
question,
because
unless
the
facts
are
specified
it's
more
difficult
to
be
more
specific.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
still
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
that
would
create
problems
under
the
due
process
clause
and
the
separation
of
powers
clause,
depending
upon
which
cases
and
which
individuals
one
was
looking
at
and
where
they
were
in
the
spectrum,
and
the
extent
to
which
the
legislation
acted,
in
fact,
prospectively
if
the
decision
had
been--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i'm
not
certain
where
the
line
would
be.
it
is
a
difficult
question
to
answer.
i
do
believe,
although
it
is
not
before
this
court,
that
cases
in
which
the
issue
is
pending,
under
my...
mr.
allen's
definition,
decided
by
a
district
court,
for
example,
but
on
appeal,
would
still
create
constitutional
questions.
where
congress
is
simply
enlarging
the
statute
of
limitations
which
has
not
been
litigated,
with
respect
to
a
claim
that
has
not
been
litigated
at
all,
i
think
congress'
power
would
be
a
great
deal
greater.
but
this
case
is
all
the
way
at
the
far
end
of
the
spectrum.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
one
of
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the...
this
court
has
said--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
of
course,
and
that's
what
i
am
hoping
that
i've
said.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
but
i
think
that--
[laughter]
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no
way
with
respect
to
final
judgments.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
congress
has
done
that,
or
this
court
and
congress--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--has
done
that
with
rule
60(b).
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i...
in
the
first
place,
rule
60(b)
is
a
codification
of
what--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
do
not
believe
so,
justice
stevens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
yes,
but--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
exactly--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
exactly
what--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
court
said
in
federated
department
stores.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
decision
was
wrong.
once
the
judgment
is
final,
that
fixes
the
rights
of
parties.
if
i
can
make
just
one
additional
point
with
respect
to
section
27a,
and
i
think
i
was
about
to
finish
making
it,
that
this
27a
is
a
very
peculiar
statute
in
that
it
completely
and
exclusively
reversed
the
roles
of
the
courts
and
the
congress.
the
court's
decision
is
now
purely
prospective,
such
as
like
the
one
that...
like
the
moitie
decision
that
the
justices
of
this
court
rejected
in
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
but
this
court
didn't.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and,
of
course,
this
court's
decision,
since
it
no
longer
affects
the
litigants
either
in
that
case
or
the
cases
that
were
pending,
strips
the...
allows
the
court
to
be
stripped
of
its
power.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
justice
ginsburg,
section
27a(a)
is
not
before
this
court.
the
court
denied
cert
in
that
case,
and
a
petition
for
cert
that
was
filed
in
that
case.
we're
only
talking
about
the
final
judgment
part
of
section
27,
not
only
the
judgment
part
of
27a(b),
but
the
final
judgment
part
of
27a(b),
so
we're
only
looking
at
one
piece
of
it.
i
would
make
some
of
those
arguments
with
respect
to
27a(a),
but
those
aren't
before
this
court.
what
is
before
this
court
is
a
classic
exercise
by
the
congress
of
changing
the
results
of
this
court.
if
it
can
change
the
results
in
lampf,
it
can
change
the
results
in
other
decisions
having
to
do
with
section
10(b).
if
it
can
change
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
courts
with
respect
to
the
securities
laws,
it
can
change
the
results
in
this
court
under
erisa,
or
rico,
or
some
other
statute.
if
it
can
change
the
result
in
lampf
and
a
group
of
cases,
it
can
change
the
result
in
a
single
case.
there
is
no
principled
stopping
point.
this
is
an
egregious
exercise
of
judicial
power
and
an
egregious
weakening
of
the
judicial
power,
and
it
is
unconstitutional.
thank
you.
