mr.
william
h.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
contend
that
section
27a(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act,
1934,
was
a
valid
exercise
of
the
legislative
power,
and
that
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
invalidating
that
statute
primarily
on
separation
of
powers
grounds
was
erroneous
and
should
be
reversed.
this
court
has
recognized
since
its
decision
in
the
united
states
v.
the
schooner
peggy
that
final
judgments
may
be
subject
to
congressional
influence
even
in
the
case
of
a
final
and
appealable
judgment
as
long
as
the
case
is
pending.
i
think
this--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--your
honor,
i
am
referring
to
a
final
judgment
in
a
case
that
is
still
within
the
appellate
process.
i'm
distinguishing
between
a
final
judgment
in
a
pending
case
and
a
final
judgment
that
has
become...
has
become
final
through
the
expiration
of
the
parties'
right
to
further
appellate
review,
and
i
refer
to
that
as
a
final
case,
and
i
think
those
distinctions
are
important
to
an
understanding
of
the
argument
that
the
petitioners
make.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i'm
saying
that
a
case
becomes
final
at
that
point.
mr.
william
h.
allen
up
until
that
point,
the
case
is
pending,
although
a
final
judgment
may
have
been
entered
in
that
case,
final
in
the
sense
that
the
court
has
issued
its
result
in
the
particular
dispute.
it
has
pronounced
what
the
result
of
the
adjudication
is,
but
the
case
is
still
somewhere
within
the
appellate
process
and
is
therefore
still
pending,
and
it's...
as
i
was
saying,
under
the
united
states
v.
the
schooner
peggy,
if
a
final
judgment
is
entered
in
a
case
that
still
is
pending
within
the
process,
the
appellate
process,
and
congress
in
the
exercise
of
the
legislative
power
changes
the
law
at
that
point,
under
the
schooner
peggy
and
its
progeny,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
court
must
apply
the
law
as
ordained
by
congress
rather
than
affirming
its
earlier
final
judgment
that
was
rightfully
rendered
and
conformed
to
the
law
which
prevailed
at
the
time
that
it
was
rendered.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
i
think
that
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
issue
that...
or
the...
what
this
case
calls
for,
i
think,
is
to
specifically
identify
the
institutional
interest
of
the
court
that
requires
separation
of
powers
protection
and
requires
the
adoption
of
the
absolute
rule
that
was
adopted
by
the
sixth
circuit,
and
that
final
judgments
in
final
cases
are
absolutely
sacrosanct
and
are
forever
beyond
the
reach
of
congress,
at
least
in
private
actions
involving
the
adjudication
of
private
statutory
rights.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
think
that
it
has.
the
closest
statute,
or
the
closest
analogy
here,
your
honor,
i
believe
is
the
statute
in
the
united
states
v.
sioux
nation
of
indians.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
actually,
i
think...
i
agree
that
the
holding
in
united
states
v.
sioux
nation
does
not
directly
address
the
question
that's
presented
in
this
case.
in
fact,
i
think
for
separation
of
powers
purposes
sioux
nation
was
actually
a
more
difficult
case
than
is
presented
by
section
27a(b),
because
27a(b)
clearly
changed
the
law.
it
made
a
substantive
change
in
the
law
and
provided
a
mechanism
by
which
this
case
and
the
defined
group
of
cases
could
be
reinstated
for
further
adjudication
by
the
courts
of
the
new
statutory
rights.
mr.
william
h.
allen
your
honor,
i
understand
and
agree
that
that
language
is
in
the
opinion.
however,
i
believe
that
that
really
addresses
more
squarely
the
due
process
argument
in
this
case
rather
than
the
separation
of
powers
issue,
which
i
believe
is
really
specifically
why
congress
should
be
prohibited
from
enacting
a
statute
which
authorizes
the
restoration
of
a
case
to
pending
status
for
further
adjudication
of
rights
that
are
created
in
that
statute.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
your
honor,
i
agree
that
that's
what
the
court
said,
but
i
do
believe
that
this
is
a
different
case
than
sioux
nation.
it
is
different
because,
again,
the
court,
or
the
congress
changed
the
law
and
created
new
rights,
and
i
think
the
difference,
or
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
is
illustrated
by
postulating
a
statute
that
very
well
may
violate
and
be
unconstitutional
under
separation
of
powers
principles
as
well
as
due
process
principles,
and
that
would
be
a
statute
involving
private
statutory
rights
that
calls
for
the
following:
the
judgment
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
in
civil
action
number
1234
is
hereby
set
aside
and
remanded
for
further
trial
or
for
retrial
on
the
same
facts
and
on
the
same
law,
with
the
further
congressional
admonition
that
you
will
continue
to
retry
this
case
on
the
same
facts
and
the
same
law
until
you
obtain
the
result
that
congress
wants,
to
wit,
judgment
for
the
defendants.
now,
that
is
a
statute
that...
involving
private
rights
that
i
think
would
clearly
be
a
judicial
act,
no
change
in
the
law,
simply
setting
aside
a
judgment
with
an
instruction
to
retry
the
case
and
attempt
to
come
up
with
another
result.
i--
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
presents
a
little
bit
more
difficult
problem
than
is
presented
by
this
case.
i
think,
again,
referring
to
the
institutional
interests
of
the
court
that
are
protected
by
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine,
the
court
has
an
interest
in
preventing
impairment
of
the
judicial
power
and
the
exercise
of
the
judicial
power,
and
i
think
there
may
be
limits
under
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine
for
legislation
which
just
wholesale
reopens
masses
of
cases
that
might
overwhelm
the
judicial
system.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
i'm
saying
that
that
might
be
an
aspect
of
it,
your
honor.
i...
that
may
not
be
the
whole
story.
i
think
the--
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
your
honor,
that
gets,
again,
back
to
the
identification
of
the
institutional
interest
that's
being
served
by
the
rule
that
you're
suggesting,
which
is
that
judgments
are
inviolate
and
that
the
rights
that
are
fixed
in
those
judgments
are
forever
beyond
the
reach
of
congress.
i
don't
believe--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--well,
i
think
there
are
some
things
that--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
they
can
just
send
it
back
without
more.
we
contend
that
they
can
change
the
law
and
the
fact
that
the
parties
whose
rights
are
affected,
or
the...
involved
in
a
prior
adjudication
and
a
final
judgment
that
became
final,
is
not
the
bright
line
between
the
constitutionality
of
the
legislative
act,
or
does
not
define
the
constitutionality
of
the
legislative
act.
the
congress
makes
the
laws.
it's
the
duty
of
the
court
to
apply
the
laws,
and
to
apply
the
laws
as
they
are
at
the
time
the
court
acts.
the
court
has
an
institutional
interest
in
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process,
and
i
don't
think
that
congress
should
be
able
to
come
along
and
run
through
and
interfere
with
the
process
of
finding
facts,
determining
and
applying
the
law,
and
coming
to
a
result,
but
congress
can,
in
its
discharge
of
its
political
and
policymaking
functions,
change,
enhance,
withdraw,
contract
the
private
rights
of
parties,
and
i
don't
think
that
the--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--indeed,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
your
honor,
i...
i
think
that
that...
i
understand
the
point
that
you're
making.
i
don't
agree,
though,
that
the
fact
that
the
judgment
has
become
final
is
the
bright
line
here,
and
that
it
limits
at
that
point
forever
more
the
power
of
congress
to
affect
those
private
rights.
another
example
that
might
shed
some
light
on
this
would
be
a
statute
which
restores
the
aiding...
or,
creates
a
cause
of
action
for
aiding
and
abetting
a
violation
of
section
10(b)
and
makes
that
retroactive
and
establishes
a
limitations
period
for
10
years.
let's
postulate
that
some
individuals
might
have
been
sued
for
aiding
and
abetting
a
violation
in
the
past,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
and
the
court
held
that
no
such
cause
of
action
existed,
and
that
judgment
became
final.
there's
no
question
that
that
judgment
would
have
been
correct
when
rendered,
but
is
that
group
of
people
forever
immunized
from
the
reach
of
congress
simply
because
they
happened
to
be
party
to
an
adjudication
that
adjudged
that
no
such
cause
of
action
existed.
mr.
william
h.
allen
and
i
think
that's
an
important
point,
that
upholding
the
statute
in
this
case
is
not
going
to
open
the
floodgates.
there
still
are
limitations
out
there
under
the
due
process
clause
and
the
separation
of
powers
clause
that
would
not
make
every
final
judgment
in
a
final
case
canon
fodder
for
congress.
mr.
william
h.
allen
no.
i
think
that,
again,
i'm
not
sure
where
the
outer
limits
of
this
would
be,
and
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
define
the
outer
limits
of
it
under
the
separation
of
powers
clause.
actually,
i
think
that
the
limits
might
come
in
the
due
process
rationality
test.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
the
limits
are
that
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine
prohibits
the
direct
exercise
of
the
judicial
power.
i
think
that
the
judicial
power,
the
essence
of
it
is
the
process
of
finding
facts,
of
determining
and
applying
the
law,
and
reaching
a
result,
and
i
think
that
if
congress
unduly
interferes
with
that,
and
again,
the
statute
that
i
postulated
as
an
example,
it
simply
sets
aside
a
judgment
that
that
kind
of
legislation
is
the
kind
of
legislation
that
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine
was
intended
to
prohibit.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--well,
i--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--well,
you
can
render
final...
you
can
render
final
decisions,
and
those
decisions
are
final,
but
i
don't
think
that
they
are
forever
immune
from
further
congressional
action.
