mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
holding
in
this
case
rests
on
the
view
that
there
is
an
indispensable
attribute
of
finality
in
judicial
decisions
that
is
completely
immune
from
any
congressional
action,
and
accordingly,
the
court
found
this
statute
invalid
under
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine.
our
position
is
that
there
is
a
sense
in
which
judicial
decisions
do
have
an
attribute
of
finality,
but
it
is
not
in
the
sense
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
in
this
case.
the
attribute
of
finality
of
a
judicial
decision
is
fairly
accurately
captured
by
the
opinions
that
were
rendered
in
hayburn's
case,
namely,
a
decision
of
an
article
iii
tribunal
is
not
subject
to
further
review
in
another
branch
of
government,
the
executive
branch,
or
congress.
the
courts
cannot
be
required
to
render
a
decision
that
depends
for
its
finality
on
another
branch's
action.
on
the
other
hand,
the
differentiation
in
the
constitution
between
legislative
and
judicial
powers
does
not
prevent
congress
from
prescribing
new
statutory
rights
that
may
be
enforced
between
private
parties
despice
the
fact
that
there
was
a
final
judgment
entered
between
those
parties
under
former
law.
the
essence
of
this
case
is
that
congress
has
changed
the
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
did
not
change
the
substantive
law
of
liability
under
rule
10b-5,
which
is
an
important
point
that
i
think
diffuses
any
possible
due
process
concern
in
this
case.
the
conduct
at
issue
here
was
unlawful
when
it
was
undertaken,
and
there
has
been
no
change
in
that
rule
whatsoever.
what
has
been
changed
retroactively
is
the
period
of
time
within
which
a
suit
under
10b-5
may
be
brought.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
could
have
filed
such
a
motion,
justice
souter,
and
some
courts
would
have
granted
it
on
the
basis
of
changed
statutory
law
that
would
entitle
them
to
reopen
the
judgment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
that
there
would
have
been
any
invalidity
in
the
ruling.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
if
congress
had
manifested
its
intent
to
apply
that
new
statute
of
limitations
for
the
benefit
of
what
you
have
called
the
blind-sided
class,
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
reopen
the
case
and
to
provide
for
further
proceedings
on
the
merits
of
the
claim.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
am
not
sure
whether
in
this
particular
case
a
rule
60(b)
motion
was
made.
there
were
some
cases
raising
this
issue
of
a
rule
60(b)
motion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
reason
why
some
courts
may
not
have
done
that
is,
there
is
a
line
of
60(b)
law
that
changes
in
statutory
law
does
not
justify
reopening
of
an
otherwise
final
judgment,
and
it
may
be
in
the
view
that
that
was
the
requirement
under
60(b)
that
those
courts
wouldn't
have
chosen
that
avenue.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
a
rule
suggested
by
the
separation
of
powers,
justice
scalia,
because
what
is
going
on
in
these
cases
is
that
congress
has
acted
legislatively
to
change
a
governing
rule
that
was
conceded
by
everyone
when
this
court...
when
lampf
was
before
this
court,
namely,
what
should
the
statute
of
limitations
be
for
a
statutory
cause
of
action?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
would
agree,
justice
kennedy.
i
don't
think
that
it
would
add
up
to
a
significant
difference
if
a
court
fell
that
it
was
mandated
by
legislation
to
reopen
a
judgment
under
rule
60(b)
from
reopening
the
judgment
under
section
27a,
subsection
(b),
if
both
actions
were
taken
because
of
a
belief
that
congress
required
it.
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
it's
quite
as
garden
variety
as
all
that,
justice
souter.
the
cases
that
have
addressed
whether
final
judgments
should
be
reopened
because
of
changes
in
statutory
law
do
not
clearly
indicate
the
courts
must
reopen
final
judgments
that
were
otherwise
not
appealed,
and
i
believe
that
it
is
for
that
reason
that
congress
prescribed
a
rule
of
law
in
section
27a,
subsection
(b),
that
in
effect
amends
rule
60(b)
for
this
particular
purpose
and
requires
courts
to
reopen
otherwise
final
cases
for
the
application
of
new
substantive
law.
there
is
nothing
in
that
legislative
action
that
is
improper.
congress
could,
if
it
wished,
take
over
the
entire
function
of
promulgating
rule
60(b),
could
change
the
categories
that
are
currently
in
it
that
permit
reopening.
certainly
if
it
does
so
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
the
general
historical
trend
of
rule
60(b)
law
which
has
evolved
over
time,
there
would
be
no
question
whatsoever
about
the
promulgation
of
such
a
rule
of
procedure.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that's
essentially
what
congress
did
in
this
case.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
lampf
and
beam
came
down
on
the
same
day,
you
have
a
class
of
plaintiffs
whose
cases
in
effect
retroactively
became
untimely,
and
the
court
declared
in
beam
that
it
was
not
going
to
engage
in
what
is
essentially
a
legislative
function
of
weighing
the
equities
of
various
similarly
situated
plaintiffs
and
determine
which
ones
get
the
benefit
of
a
new
rule
and
which
ones
do
not.
congress
stepped
in
with
what
is
a
very
legislative
act,
balancing
equities
that
the
court
itself
does
not
have
freedom
to
balance,
and
determining
certain
plaintiffs,
whose
cases
were
timely
filed
under
the
law
of
their
circuits
when
they
were
brought,
should
have
an
opportunity
to
go
back
to
court
and
reach...
have
the
merits
of
their
cases
adjudicated.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
lampf
is
probably--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
generally
the
way
that
this
court
operates
when
it
interprets
a
statute.
lampf
may
qualify
as
a
rare
exception
to
that,
because
the
court
very
freely
conceded
that
there
was
no
underlying
statutory
right
that
congress
had
ever
created
or
that
it
was
ever
aware
of,
and
that
in
fashioning
a
statute
of
limitations
the
court
was
forced
to
act
in
a
manner
that
it
isn't
comfortable
acting
and
is
uncharacteristic
for
it,
namely,
determining
what
the
proper
legislative
solution
would
have
been
if
congress
had
addressed
the
question.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
breyer,
they're
not...
first
of
all,
this
law
doesn't
take
away
money--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the...
if
money
is
taken
away
it's
because
the
defendants
committed
securities
fraud
under
then
existing
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
let
me
explain
why
congress
believed
that
it
was
fair,
rather
than
constituting
any
kind
of
a
vendetta.
it
was
the
essence
of
fairness
to
restore
the
right
of
these
plaintiffs
to
litigate
on
the
merits--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
any
retroactive
legislation
will
apply,
necessarily,
to
cases
that
can
be
identified,
and
the
court
has
upheld
not
only
retroactive
legislation
under
the
due
process
clause,
but
has
upheld
legislation
such
as
in
robertson
v.
seattle
audubon
society
that
was
enacted
with
the
specific
purpose
in
mind
of
affecting
a
particular
pending
case,
so
i
don't
think
that
by
itself,
retroactivity
constitutes
a
separation
of
powers
problem.
what
congress
was
doing
here
was
something
quite
similar
to
what
the
court
itself
had
done
under
the
rule
of
chevron
oil
v.
huson,
namely,
taking
into
account
that
people
rely
on
what
the
statute
of
limitations
is
when
they
choose
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
plaintiffs
in
these
cases
relied
on
the
statute
of
limitations
in
their
respective
jurisdictions,
and
this
case,
for
example,
was
filed
before
any
federal
court
had
ever
applied
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
to
a
rule
10b-5
case,
borrowing
it
from
another
section
of
the
securities
laws.
when
this
court
decided
lampf,
many
people
who
justifiably
relied
on
the
existing
state
of
the
law
were
surprised,
or
congress
could
have
so
found,
and
this
court,
while
it
could
have
taken
action
to
protect
similarly
situated
plaintiffs
under
chevron
oil
v.
huson,
and
it
had
indeed
taken
such
action
in
other
statute
of
limitations
cases
where
the
statute
was,
in
effect,
retroactively
made
shorter,
had
declared
in
beam
that
it
would
not
take
action
to
protect
these
particular
cases.
and
congress
really
was
stepping
in
to
restore
a
level
playing
field
to
the
parties
who
had
relied
on
existing
law
in
bringing
their
lawsuit.
it
did
not
determine
what
the
outcomes
of
this
lawsuit
would
be.
that
would
raise
a
wholly
different
and
more
difficult
separation
of
powers
problem
under
klein,
if
congress
had
in
fact
dictated
what
the
ultimate
merit
outcome
would
be
of
a
lawsuit
between
private
parties.
it
did
nothing
of
the
kind
here.
it
restored
parties
to
the
places
they
would
be
under
then-existing
statute
of
limitations
law.
it
did
not
even
declare
that
the
suits
must
be
reinstated.
the
plaintiff
must
show
that
his
suit
would
have
been
timely
under
the
law
that
prevailed
in
this
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
believe,
justice
breyer,
that
the
court
has
to
say
that.
all
the
court
has
to
recognize
is
that
congress
could
legitimately
have
viewed
it
as
a
change
in
law
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
this
court's
holding
was
a
novelty
in
this
court's
jurisprudence.
thank
you.
