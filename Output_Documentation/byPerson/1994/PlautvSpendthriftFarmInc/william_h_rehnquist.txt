chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-1121,
ed
plaut
v.
the
spendthrift
farm,
inc.--
mr.
allen,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say...
you
say
a
final
judgment.
you
mean
a
final
judgment
in,
say,
a
trial
court,
or
do
you
mean
a
final
judgment
that
has
run
through
the
appeal
process
and
has
become
final
against
direct
review?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
congress
intended
the
law
to
be
retrospectively
applied.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
another
sense,
sioux
nation
was
an
easier
case,
since
the
party
defendant
was
the
government,
the
party
who
had
the
benefit
of
the
prior
judgment,
and
i
think
the
court
opinion
suggested
that
the
government
as
a
litigant
could
waive
rights
but
it
might
not
be
able
to
impose
the
same
sort
of
waivers
on
other
parties
who
are
not
the
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
would
those
limitations
be
as
to
the
separation
of
powers?
so
long
as
the
congressional
action
just
deals
with
a
few
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say,
in
effect,
very
likely
the
separation
of
powers
clause
doesn't
provide
any
limits.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
what
are
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
allen.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
didn't
change
the
substantive
law,
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
93-1121
plaut
v.
spendthrift
farm,
inc.
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
