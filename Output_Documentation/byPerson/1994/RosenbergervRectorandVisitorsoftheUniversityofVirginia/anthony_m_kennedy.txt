suppose...
just
on
this
one
point,
suppose
the
religious
newspaper
engaged
in
soliciting
members,
proselytizing,
coupons
to
fill
out
and
return
that
are
contained
in
the
newspaper,
does
that
change
the
case,
or
make
it
a
more
difficult
case?
justice
anthony
m.

that
cannot
be
equated
with
the
political
restrictions
against
campaigning.

mr.
mcconnell--
justice
anthony
m.

--a
new
subject,
and
i
know
your
time
is
about
to
expire.
you
may
want
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
can
never
recognize
that
there
may
be
a
gray
area
where
we're
not
sure
that
there's
an
establishment
clause
or
not,
and
use
that
determination
as
a
ground
for
withholding
support
from
the
activity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
is
different
from
lobbying
and
campaigning.
your
premise
that
you're
submitting
to
us
is
that
because
it
is
permissible
to
withhold
funding
from
active
campaigning
in
the
political
sphere,
therefore
it
is
permissible
to
hold...
to
withhold
funding
for
abstract
discussions
of
religious
views,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
two
do
not
follow
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
university
can
say
that
these
are
not
educational
activities,
and
draw
the
line
there.
but
it
doesn't
follow
that
it
can
draw
the
further
line
that
discussion
of
abstract
views
of
religion
is
also
prohibited.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
where
your
parallelism
breaks
down.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
any
discussion
of
religious
views
is
proselytizing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
jeffries,
suppose
that
a
student
newspaper
decides
that
regular
columns
are
good
for
the
newspaper.
readers
like
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
said,
we
want
good
writers,
and
we
want
four
regular
columns,
and
they
have
a
survey
of
the
best
writers,
and
one
of
them
is
a
religious
writer,
a
christian
writer,
and
that's
all
he
writes
about
in
the
column.
can
the
university
promulgate
a
guideline
to
withdraw
funding
by
reason
of
the
printing
of
that
column?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
the
university
constitutionally
do
it
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
this
case
any
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
secular
humanism?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
of
course
the
only
justification
for
your
using
the
word,
religious
activity,
is
because
of
the
special
way
in
which
this
regulation
defines
it.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
religious
speech.
that
is
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
religious
activities
and
religious
exercises.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
only
thing
that's
at
issue
here
is
religious
speech,
not
religious
exercise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
opinion
that
i
have
to
announce
is
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
rosenberger
v.
rector
and
visitors
of
the
university
of
virginia.
at
the
university
of
virginia
all
full-time
students
pay
a
$14
per
semester
mandatory
fee
and
the
money
goes
to
a
student
activities
fund
sometimes
called
saf.
now,
this
case
concerns
a
refusal
of
the
university
acting
under
its
guidelines
to
pay
for
the
printing
cost
of
the
student
newspaper
called
wide
awake
and
wide
awake
is
a
newspaper
with
the
christian’s
point
of
view.
it’s
recognized
by
the
university
as
a
student
organization
authorized
to
operate
in
the
campus.
but,
with
safeguard
to
make
it
clear
that
the
university
is
not
responsible
for
its
actions
or
statements.
wide
awake
published
three
issues
and
then
requested
the
saf
the
fund,
to
pay
the
outside
printing
and
that’s
the
way
the
fund
works.
the
fund
does
not
pay
students
or
student
organization
directly;
it
pays
outside
contractors
directly.
the
university
refused
to
pay
the
printer’s
bill.
it
relied
on
guidelines
forbidding
assistance
to
a
publication
that“primarily
manifests
a
particular
belief
in
or
a
about
a
deity
or
an
ultimate
reality.”
so,
the
issue
is
whether
the
university’s
denial
or
support
is
first
of
all,
a
denial
of
the
paper’s
free
speech
rights
under
the
first
amendment
and
second
whether
any
such
violation
is
excused
because
the
university
has
an
obligation
to
deny
assistance
from
the
fund
to
prevent
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
probation
against
an
establishment
of
religion.
the
university
prevailed
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
now
reverse.
as
to
the
speech
question
the
student
activities
fund
is
much
like
the
limited
forums
that
we
have
addressed
in
the
earlier
cases.
if
a
state
entity
such
as
the
university
creates
a
limited
public
forum
for
the
discussion
of
views
it
is
bound
to
respect
the
rule
that
it
itself
has
established
for
the
forum,
his
subjects
are
within
the
purpose
of
the
forum.
the
state
may
not
discriminate
based
on
viewpoint.
there
is
viewpoint
discrimination
here.
the
subject
such
as
racism
can
be
discussed
and
saf
support
it
a
lot
but
if
an
article
on
the
same
subject
primarily
manifests
a
religious
point
of
view
support
is
disallowed.
the
university
argues
that
it
can
make
speech
decisions
based
on
content
in
order
to
perform
its
educational
mission
and
adopt
academic
programs
but
that’s
quite
beside
the
point.
the
speech
here
is
not
the
university’s
it’s
the
speech
of
the
students.
vital
first
amendment
speech
principles
are
at
stake
here.
the
first
danger,
that
liberty
lies
in
granting
the
state
the
power
to
examine
publications
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
based
on
some
ultimate
idea
and
then
to
classify
them.
the
second
and
corollary
danger
is
the
danger
to
speech
from
chilling
the
thought
and
the
expression
of
its
citizens.
the
danger
is
especially
real
in
the
university
setting
for
the
university
to
disapprove
particular
viewpoints
of
its
students,
risks,
suppression
as
free
speech
and
creative
enquiry
and
one
of
the
most
vital
centers
for
the
nation’s
intellectual
life,
its
college
and
university
campuses.
if
the
university’s
regulation
were
applied
with
much
vigor
at
all
it
would
bar
the
printer
for
assays
by
hypothetical
student
contributors
name
plato,
spinoza,
and
descartes.
both
by
its
terms
and
in
its
application
in
this
case
the
regulation
is
a
denial
as
the
right
of
free
speech
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
now
it
remains
to
consider
whether
that
violation
is
excused
by
the
necessity
of
the
university’s
complying
with
the
establishment
clause.
we
find
no
establishment
violation,
in
payment
of
the
printer’s
bill
by
the
student
activities
fund,
the
government
program
that
issue
except
for
the
regulation
that
we
are
discussing
is
neutral
towards
religion.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
university
created
its
program
to
advance
religion
or
aid
a
religious
cause.
the
purpose
of
the
student
activities
fund
is
to
open
a
forum
of
speech
and
to
support
various
student
enterprises
in
recognition
of
the
diversity
and
creativity
of
student
life.
neutrality
is
evident
in
the
fact
that
the
university
has
taken
pains
to
dissociate
itself
from
the
private
speech
involved
in
any
student
publication.
no
public
funds
flow
directly
into
wide
awake’s
coffers.
excess
is
granted
on
a
religion
neutral
basis
to
avoid
spectrum
of
student
groups
and
in
this
respect
the
case
is
little
different
from
earlier
cases
where
we
have
allowed
student
groups
under
a
religion
neutral
plan
to
use
school
facilities
after
hours
even
if
the
group
engages
in
religious
activities.
we
see
no
difference
in
logical
principle
and
no
difference
of
constitutional
significance
between
using
funds
to
operate
a
facility
and
paying
a
third
party
contractor
which
was
the
arrangement
here.
where
the
contrary
view
to
become
law
the
university
could
only
avoid
a
constitutional
violation
by
examining
publications
for
their
content,
least
they
create
too
great
a
religious
message,
that
censorship
would
be
far
more
inconsistent
with
the
establishment
clause
than
would
be
the
governmental
provision
of
secular
printing
services
on
a
religion
neutral
basis.
there
is
no
establishment
clause
violation
in
the
university
is
honoring
its
duties
under
the
free
speech
clause.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justices
stevens,
ginsburg
and
breyer.
