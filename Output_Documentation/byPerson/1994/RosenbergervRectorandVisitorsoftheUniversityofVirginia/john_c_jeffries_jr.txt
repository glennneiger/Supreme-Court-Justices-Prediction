mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
not
specifically
about
religion.
it
is
about
funding,
and
the
choices
that
inevitably
must
be
made
in
allocating
scarce
resources.
some
funding
decisions
do
not
involve
speech,
but
in
a
pubic
university
virtually
all
of
them
do.
in
public
education,
funding
speech
based
on
content
is
legitimate,
routine,
and
absolutely
necessary.
under
the
university
guidelines--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--i
do.
under
the
university--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--i
do
think
that's
exactly
the
heart
of
the
question,
and
if
i
may
just
clear
up
one
issue
that
was
left
over
from
the
earlier
colloquy,
under
the
university's
guidelines,
the
definition
of
political
activity,
which
is
defined
to
mean
lobbying
or
electioneering,
and
the
definition
of
religious
activities
are
not
exactly
alike,
but
they
raise
precisely
the
same
constitutional
question.
imagine
that
students
organized
themselves
in
support
of
the
president's
reelection
campaign,
and
published
a
clinton
reelection
newspaper.
that
would
be
an
electioneering
activity.
we
would
not
fund
it
for
that
reason.
imagine
that
students
lobby
the
state
legislature
to
pass
or
defeat
the
balanced
budget
amendment.
that
would
be
a
lobbying
activity.
students
have
a
constitutional
right
to
support
the
reelection
of
the
president.
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
lobby
the
legislature.
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
advocate
their
religious
beliefs.
all
of
these
cases
present
precisely
the
same
free
speech
issue,
and
they
stand
or
fall
on
that
basis.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
the
intent
of
the
guidelines
is
to
allow
in
the
political
area
a
wide
variety
of
point
of
views,
and
to
except
two
fairly
narrow
categories,
electioneering,
by
which
i
mean
publication
devoted
expressly
to
an
election
result,
hence
the
clinton
campaign
newsletter,
and
lobbying
legislatures.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
liberal
and
conservative
points
of
view
are
freely
permitted.
indeed,
all
points
of
view
are
permitted.
the
question
is,
which
are
funded--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--and
the
exclusion
from
funding
would
be
those
activities
so
closely
allied
with
an
election
result
as
to
be
found
to
be
electioneering.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
yes,
sir,
would
be
eligible
for
funding.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
the
guidelines
make
that
distinction.
my
point
in
suggesting
that
these
raise
the
same
constitutional
issue
was
to
say
that
in
all
three
categories,
electioneering,
lobbying,
and
religious
activities,
the
guidelines
say,
rights
which
people
have
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in,
activities
which
people
have
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in,
we
nonetheless
will
not
fund.
if
that's
an
unconstitutional
action
in
refusing
to
fund
religious
activities
under
the
free
speech
clause,
it
must
follow
that
it's
equally
unconstitutional
to
refuse
to
fund
the
clinton
campaign
reelection
newsletter
or
to
refuse
to
fund
students
engaged
in
lobbying
activities
under
the
free
speech
clause--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--why
do
the
guidelines
make
the
distinction
they
make?
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
the
guidelines--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--obviously,
if
the
establishment
clause
forbids
us
from
giving
direct
aid
to
religion,
there
is
an
end
to
the
matter,
but
we
do
not
stand
on
that
ground.
we
take
the
following
position.
there
is
in
this
country
a
long
and
honored
tradition
of
financial
disengagement...
again,
this
is
a
question
of
funding,
not
activities.
there
is
a
long
tradition
in
this
country
of
financial
disengagement
between
church
and
state.
we
think
it's
entirely
reasonable
for
the
university
to
adhere
to
that
tradition.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
the
plaintiffs
were
not
denied
eligibility
as
a
religious
organization.
they
are
not
a
church,
and
they
were
not
denied
funding
on
that
ground.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
they
were
denied
funding
because
the
publication
of
this
magazine
was
found
to
be
a
religious
activity,
a
conclusion
that
they
have
not...
never
contested.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
because
it
primarily
manifests
a
particular
belief
in
or
about
a
deity,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
well,
in
my
judgment,
justice
kennedy,
the
cases
on
which
the
petitioners
rely
are
quite
consistently
free
speech
cases.
if
the
court
had
meant
to
specify
something
special
about
religion,
it
probably
would
have
relied
on
the
free
exercise
clause,
so
the
inference
which
i
made
is
that
under
the
free
speech
clause,
lobbying,
electioneering,
religious
activities
are
all
protected,
and
all
comparably
protected
under
the
constitution.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
it
may
be
misleading
to
think
of
the
university's
policy
as
refusing
to
fund
a
discussion
of
abstract
views.
the
university
refuses
to
fund
religious
activities.
this
magazine
is
a
proselytizing
activity.
basically,
religious
activity
means
worship
services
and
prayer,
or
proselytizing,
so
there
is
little
doubt
that
this
magazine
fits
the
university's
guideline.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
that
constitutes
a
religious
activity.
let
me
try
to
answer
the
rest
of
your
question,
if
i
may,
justice
scalia.
in
addition
to
the
longstanding
tradition
of
financial
disengagement
between
church
and
state,
in
this
particular
area,
we
feel
there's
a
very
strong
concern.
by
denying
all
religious
activities
university
funding,
we
avoid
having
to
choose
among
them.
how
would
you
choose
among
them?
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
our
policy
on
that
is
exactly
the
policy
reflected
in
the
religious
studies
department.
we
study--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--funding
decisions,
justice
breyer,
are
not
made
on
the
basis
of
articles
or
columns
or
particular
essays.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
the
distinction--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--on
these
facts,
we
think
that
distinction
is
clear.
a
magazine
which
is
devoted
in
all
of
its
content
to
proselytizing
specific
religious
beliefs
is
a
religious
activity
under
the
guidelines.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
let
me
answer
that
question
this
way.
in
a
standard
which
depends
significantly
on
the
word,
primarily...
the
university
guidelines
does--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--there
are
inevitably
questions
of
degree,
and
there
may
well
be
close
cases,
and
there
may
well
be
a
line-drawing
problem
down
the
road.
now,
i
will
say,
we've
not
had
that
problem
before
this
litigation.
but
in
this
case,
the
fundamentally,
consistently,
in
the
word
of
the
fourth
circuit,
the
unflaggingly
religious
character
of
the
publication
has
never
been
contested
or
denied.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
we
have
not
attempted
to
promulgate
such
a
guideline.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
i
doubt
it.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
we
have...
the
standard,
as
i
see,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
is
basically
a
standard
of
reasonableness.
public
money
cannot
be
a
public
forum.
there
cannot
be
a
right
of
access
to
the
budget
of
the
university
of
virginia.
so
the
standard
is
that
of
perry
education
association
and
other
cases,
and
that
standard
says
that
the
approach
must
be
reasonable,
and
it
must
not
reflect
an
effort
to
suppress
expression
because
public
officials
oppose
the
speaker's
view.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
university
does
not
fund
all
sorts
of
student
activities.
they
fund
some
broad
categories,
and
there
are
other
broad
categories
that
are
excluded.
the
funds
we're
talking
about
here
are
raised
by
mandatory
fees.
they're
exactly
like
tuition
and
taxes.
they're
distributed
by
a
budgetary
process,
by
an
official
decisionmaking
process,
just
like
money
raised
from
tuition
and
taxes.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
that
is
entirely
correct.
they're
not...
well,
the
first
part
is
entirely
correct.
they
are
not
devoted
to
espousing
a
particular
point
of
view.
they
are
devoted...
in
funding,
now,
not
access,
they
are
devoted
to
those
activities
which
in
the
judgment
of
the
board
of
visitors
are
consistent
with
the
educational
purpose
of
the
university,
and
there
are
several
categories
that
are
in,
and
there
are
several
categories
that
are
out,
religion
being
one
of
the
out
categories.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
widmar
makes
explicit
reference
to
the
fact
that
it
is
not
intended
to
apply
to
funds.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
that's
exactly
right,
and
the
university
does
not
discriminate
in
any
way.
these
plaintiffs
have
full
access
to
university
facilities.
if
i
may
just
explain
why
that--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--justice
stevens
said
in
widmar
that
if
access
were
short,
that
is,
if
it
needed
to
be
rationed,
that
would
warrant
the
university
giving
access
on
the
basis
of
the
content
of
speech.
the
distinctive
fact
about
higher
education,
and
about
public
education
generally,
is
that
owing
to
the
demand
at
peak
hours,
classroom
space
always
is
in
abundant
supply
after
hours,
so
on
the
facts
of
widmar,
on
the
facts
of
lamb's
chapel,
there
is
no
need
to
ration
anything.
it's
a
benefit
that
can
be
provided
at
practically
no
marginal
cost.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
it
has
been
practically
so
in
our
experience.
i
agree
with--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--yes,
ma'am,
and
i
agree
with
justice
stevens
that
if
access
needed
to
be
limited
either
because
of
cost
or
because
of
a
lack
of
physical
space,
that
would
present
a
very
different
case
from
what
was
presented
in
widmar
or
what
was
presented
in
lamb's
chapel.
funding
must--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--if
there
were
a
shortage
of
space
that
would
present
a--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--a
very
different
question.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
for
that
point,
i
am.
[laughter]
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
and
we
do
not
restrict
access,
so
to
the
extent
that
the
concern
is
about
access,
these
plaintiffs
have
no
quarrel
with
us.
this
entire
case
involves
the
question
of
whether
we
write
them
a
check.
now,
justice
o'connor,
very
early
you
asked
me
a
question
which
i'd
like
to
get
to.
i
think
it's
the
heart
of
the
case.
as
i
hear
the
petitioners,
they
more
or
less
concede
that
in
giving
out
scarce
money,
judgments
just
inevitably
be
made.
choices
must
be
made,
there
must
be
priorities,
so
that
the
major
ground
of
dispute
here
is
their
claim
that
the
university's
guidelines
are
guilty
of
antireligious
viewpoint
discrimination.
that
is
not
true.
the
university
funds,
not
opinions
or
viewpoints,
but
activities.
the
university
does
not
fund
religious
activities.
the
university
does
not
fund
antireligious
activities.
if
there
were
a
journal
of
antireligion,
if
there
were
a
journal
devoted
primarily
to
denying
the
existence
of
a
deity,
we
would
not
fund
it,
it
would
not
be
eligible
for
funding,
and
it
would
not
be
eligible
on
precisely
the
ground
that
wide
awake
is
not
eligible.
if
there
were
an
anti-christian
newsletter
devoted
primarily
to
denying
the
tenets
of
christianity,
we
would
not
fund
it,
it
would
not
be
eligible
for
funding,
and
it
would
not
be
eligible
for
funding
on
precisely
the
ground
that
wide
awake
is
not
eligible
for
funding.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
a
journal
devoted
to
secular
humanism?
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
as
far
as
i
know
from
the
name
you've
given
it,
that
would
be
fine.
i
confess,
i'm
never
sure
that
i
know
what
secular
humanism
is.
[laughter]
thank
you.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
if
it
were
primarily
devoted
to
the
all-religion-is-rot
position,
it
would
qualify
as
a
religious
activity
under
the
guidelines
and
would
not
be
funded.
my
point
in
emphasizing
this
is
to
make
a
statement
to
you
that
the
university
of
virginia
feels
very
strongly
about.
we
are
not
picking
out
a
religious
point
of
view
and
trying
to
suppress
it.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
yes,
we
do
exactly
that,
justice
scalia,
with
respect,
for
example,
to
lobbying
and
electioneering.
in
all
these
areas,
we
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
my
understanding
of
the
widmar
and
lamb's
chapel
line
of
cases,
which
say
that
so
long
as
they
have
a
surplus
of
rooms,
so
long
as
there
is
no
need
to
ration
access
to
them,
so
long
as
everyone
can
be
accommodated,
those
exclusions--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--no,
sir,
it
did
not,
but
you
have
to
read
widmar
and
regan
at
the
same
time.
if
those
facts
are
not
stressed
in
the
widmar
opinion...
and,
by
the
way,
i
think
i
spoke
too
quickly,
widmar
does
say,
and
this
is
the
majority
opinion,
nor
do
we
question
the
right
of
the
university
to
make
academic
judgments
as
to
how
best
to
allocate
scarce
resources,
which
is
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
widmar
does
say
that,
but
more
importantly,
regan
is
a
unanimous
decision
of
this
court.
regan
concerns
funds
and,
frankly,
we
think
regan
and
our
case
are
on
all
fours.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
justice
souter,
the
university
pays
my
salary.
it's
not
true
that
i
represent
in
the
classroom
any
particular
university
point
of
view,
it's
not
true
that
i
am
a
spokesman
for
a
particular
campaign,
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
university
is
not
indifferent
to
what
i
do
there.
in
other
words,
in
the
classroom
there
is
a
very
broad
range
of
educational
speech
that
is
funded,
but
that's
not
to
say
that
all
speech
is
funded.
exactly
the
same
is
true
of
the
student
activities
fees.
is
that
responsive?
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
any
distinction
can
be
made,
so
long
as
it
meets
this
court's
standard
of
being
reasonable
and
not
an
effort
to
suppress
expression
merely
because
public
officials
oppose
the
speaker's
view.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
insofar
as
it's
put
out
by
fraternities,
i
feel
confident--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--it
is
eligible
to
be
considered
for
funding.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
we
say
the
fact
that
this
case
involves
scarce
dollars
is
decisively
important,
and
we
rely
very
heavily
on
regan,
and
also
on
rust
v
sullivan.
from
petitioner's
point
of
view,
the
establishment
clause
is
a
grave
problem,
because
there
are
many
decisions
of
this
court
stating
that
where
religion
is
involved
funding
does
matter,
that
it
matters
quite
a
lot.
so
petitioners
are
essentially
coming
to
the
court
and
saying
either
that
a
lot
of
past
establishment
clauses
need
to
be
distinguished
within
an
inch
of
their
lives,
or
they
need
to
be
overruled.
that
is,
as
you
can
tell
from
the
exchange,
including
the
exchange
among
religious
amici,
that
is
a
controversial
proposition,
but
it
is
only
the
first
step
in
petitioners'
argument.
petitioners
not
only
want
this
court
to
overrule
establishment
clause
cases
and
permit
government
to
give
direct
aid
to
religious
activities
where
other
activities
get
such
aid,
petitioners
want
to
go
farther.
they
want
to
take
a
second
step
which
is
truly
radical,
to
say
that
where
other
activities
get
government
aid,
government
must
fund
religious
activities.
petitioners
want
to
go--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,

oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
the
step--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--access
to
a
budget
is
a
major
step.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and
they
are,
once
they're
there,
virtually
cost-free
to
allow
two
classes
or
three
classes
as
opposed
to
one
or
two,
virtually
cost-free.
no
practical
significance
to
that.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
may
i
try
to
identify
the
consequences?
if,
as
petitioners
claim,
government
funding
of
speech
activities
must
be
accompanied
by
government
funding
of
religious
activities,
if
that's
true,
all
of
public
education
as
we
know
it
is
unconstitutional.
every
public
school
in
america
at
every
level
in
every
state
does
what
we
do.
they
fund
speech--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--different
from--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--well,
our
definition
of
religious
activity
is
stated
in
the
guidelines
that's
been
quoted
to
you.
it
includes
activities,
and
the
activity
here
is
the
publication
of
a
magazine,
and
that
involves
religious
speech.
maybe
i'm
missing
your
point.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
justice
kennedy,
you're
drawing
a
distinction
that
i
do
not
clearly
apprehend.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
we
would
not
be
in
a
position
of
funding
any
speech
by
speech.
that's
simply
not
the--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--all
those
may
be
published,
and
they
all
may
be
published
in
a
newspaper
which
publishes
lots
of
points
of
view.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and
as
those
guidelines
are
applied,
they
focus
for
the
hallmarks
of
a
religious
activity
on
observances
or
proselytizing,
which
we
do
not
wish
to
fund.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
the
opening--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--it
might
be,
depending
on
the
facts
more
carefully
defined.
the
magazine--
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
--the
only
reason
i
haven't
said
yes
is
because
i
don't
know
enough
about
your
hypothetical
magazine
to
have
a
confident
reaction
to
it.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
and
that
is...
yes,
sir,
exactly.
mr.
john
c.
jeffries,
jr.
i
think
the
best
answer
i
can
give
you
is
that
the
magazines
in
the
record
do
manifest
a
religious
belief.
the
letter
from
the
editor
in
the
inaugural
issue
says
that
its
mission
is
to
challenge
christians
to
live
in
word
and
deed
according
to
the
faith.
thank
you,
sir.
