justice

mr.
mcconnell,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
directed
specifically
to
religious
activities
and
the
state
of
our
precedent?
is
there
any
decision
so
far
that
has
authorized
a
direct
cash
contribution
from
the
state
organ
in
support
of
a
religious
activity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
for
a
purpose
directed
by
the
state,
that
is,
vocational
education,
but
for
a
pursuit
that
the
religious
group...
that
the
group
engaged
in
an
avowedly
religious
activity
has
charted
for
itself.
i
don't...
i'm
not
aware
of
such
a
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
just...
mr.
mcconnell,
i
just
wanted
to
know
if
there
was
any
precedent.
you
gave
me
the
case
where
the
state
was
supporting
vocational
education,
and
you
said,
that's
the
closest
case
to
this
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mcconnell,
what
about
the
university's
having
in
mind
student
cases
that
are
coming
up
around
the
country,
students
who
say,
i
don't
want
my
money,
i
don't
want
my
activity
fee
to
support
something
with
which
i
disagree?
one
of
the
amici
presented
those
cases
to
us.
if
this
activity
were
to
be
supported,
would
the
university
not
have
to
allow
all
the
people
who
don't
want
their
money
to
support
a
religious
activity
to
get
a
deduction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
about
the
student
who
says
it
isn't
like
the
post
office
because
when
we're
dealing
with
the
establishment
clause,
this
court
has
recognized
a
right
that
is
not
recognized
in
any
other
area,
that
is,
flast
v.
cohen,
where
the
taxpayer
can
challenge
the
use
of
her
money
to
support
a
religious
activity.
we
don't
allow
taxpayer's
challenges
any
place
else,
and
so
a
student
might
say,
even
if
i
can't
complaint
about
my
dollars
going
to
some
political
group
with
which
i
disagree,
i
can
make
that
complaint
with
respect
to
a
religious
activity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jeffries,
if
we
don't
accept
your
distinction
placing
this
closer
to
the
government
choosing
what
subjects
it
wants
discussed,
and
we
do
accept
that
it's
government
facilitating
speech
of
others,
not
its
own
choices,
you...
how
would
you
address
the
establishment
objection
that
you've
assiduously
stayed
away
from
in
your
brief?
suppose
we
reject
your
position
on
the
free
speech
side
of
it?
let
me
try
to
state
as
clearly
as
i
can,
since
the
briefs
are
so
different
in
their
emphasis
on
the
establishment
clause,
what
we
think
the
relevance
of
that
question
is
to
this
case.
petitioners
say
that
the
fact
that
this
case
involves
funding
doesn't
matter
at
all,
and
they
rely
heavily
on
access
cases,
