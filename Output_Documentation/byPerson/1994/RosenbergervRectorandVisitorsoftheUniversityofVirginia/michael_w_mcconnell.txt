mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
common
ground
in
this
case
that
if
a
group
of
students
satisfied
all
of
the
objective
eligibility
requirements
to
form
a
student
newspaper,
or
in
the
terms
of
the
university
guidelines,
a
student
news,
information,
opinion,
entertainment,
or
academic
communications
media
group,
that
they
could
not
be
excluded
from
funding
under
the
guidelines
simply
because
they
espouse
a
controversial
or
otherwise
political,
ideological,
philosophical
position
of
a
secular
sort.
thus,
if
my
clients
this
morning
were
the
sds,
if
they
were
vegetarians,
if
they
were
members
of
the
federalist
society,
or
black
separatists,
or
whatever,
there
would
be
no
need
to
be
here
this
morning.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
then
i'll
ask
democrats,
just
to
make
it--
[laughter]
your
honor,
even
if
they
were
republicans
or
democrats,
they
would
not
be
excluded,
because
under
the
university's
guidelines,
an
otherwise
eligible
organization
is
not
excluded
merely
because
it
espouses
political
viewpoints
within
its
activities,
no
matter
how
unpopular
those
may
be.
your
honor,
this
case
is
different
because
my
clients
are
not
the
sds
or
the
republicans,
they
are...
their
orientation
is
religious.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
there
are
two
relevant
exclusions
for
political
groups.
one
of
those
is
for
political
organizations,
and
it
might
very
well
be
that
an
organization
set
up
affiliated
with
the
republican
or
democratic
party
could
be
excluded
at
the
university
of
virginia
on
that
ground.
of
course,
that
is
not
applicable
here.
my
clients
are
not
affiliated
with
any
national
or
other
religious
organization.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
the
guidelines
expressly
provide,
and
i
refer
to
page
66...
65
to
66a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
the
rules
specifically
provide
that
these
restrictions
on
funding
political
activities
are
not
intended
to
preclude
funding
of
any
otherwise
eligible
student
organization
which
espouses
particular
positions
or
ideological
viewpoints,
including
those
that
may
be
unpopular,
or
that
are
not
generally
accepted.
as
i
understand
this
rule,
your
honor,
the
point
is
that
if
there's
an
organization
that
is
simply
engaging
in
electioneering,
or
lobbying,
which
are
much
more
narrow...
much
narrower
categories
than
the
espousal
of
a
viewpoint,
that
such
groups
can
be
excluded,
but
groups
cannot
be
excluded
because
they
are
expressing
even
controversial
political
viewpoints
in
a
student
newspaper.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
there's
been
no--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that's
exactly
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
correct,
and
there's
been
no
claim
in
this
case
that
my
clients
are
a
religious
organization.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
exactly.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
difference
is
the
language
that
i
was
just
reading
a
moment
ago,
which
excludes
from
the
definition
of
political
activities
the
mere,
65a
to
66a,
very
top
of
the
page
of
66a,
are
not
intended
to
include
funding,
preclude
funding
of
any
otherwise
eligible
student
organization
which
3)
espouses
particular
positions
or
ideological
viewpoints.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
by
otherwise
eligible,
i
assume
your
honor,
that
they're
referring
to
the
criteria
for
being
a
news,
information,
opinion,
entertainment,
or
academic
media
group.
i
might
add
here,
i'm
not
sure
that
this
is--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--your
honor,
whether
the...
the
young
republicans
would
presumably
be
a
political
organization,
but
that
is
not...
my
clients
have
not
been
excluded
because
they
are
a
religious
organization.
they
are
not
a
religious
organization.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
under
the
guidelines,
that's
exactly
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
right,
and
the
very
same
students
could
get
together
and
put
out
a
newspaper.
in
fact,
the
virginia
advocate,
which
is
a
funded
organization,
looks
very
much
like
the
sort
of
newspaper
the
young
republicans
would
publish,
and
that
is
funded.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
the
line
that
we
believe
that
this
court's
cases
establish,
and
that
the
first
amendment
imposes,
is
a
line
that
prohibits
viewpoint
discrimination.
if
the
university
is
excluding
all
political
organizations
whatever
their
orientation
or
persuasion,
our
position
is
that
that
is
not
unconstitutional.
let
me
just
point--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--your
honor,
if
that
rule
were
in
fact
applied
to
all
newspapers,
that
prohibited
all
endorsements
of
political
candidates,
we
would
not
claim
that
that
is
unconstitutional.
of
course,
that
is
not
the
guideline.
in
fact,
student
newspapers
regularly
endorse
candidates
for
office,
and
let
me
point
out
here
that
this
case
is
extraordinarily--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--just
as
my
clients
are
not
identified
with
any
religious
denomination
or
other
organization.
let
me
point
out--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
assume
that
any
student
activity,
and
part
of
the
student
activity
is
usually
recruiting
other
members,
and
i
wouldn't
think
that
wide
awake
would
be
any
more
precluded
from
inviting
others
to
join
in
wide
awake's
activity
than
any
other
student
group,
and
of
course--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
again
i
don't
think
that
the
virginia
advocate
is
precluded
from
trying
to
persuade
students
to
join
the
virginia
advocate,
or
to
join
in
its
causes,
and--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--wide
awake
is
also
not
a
church,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--your
honor,
if
you
look
at
wide
awake
magazine--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--your
honor,
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
a
distinction
of
that
sort
would
be
administrable.
i'm
not...
i
don't
know
how
you
can
tell
the
difference.
there...
one
is
not
converted
to
membership
in
god.
there
is
a
world
view
which
is
theistic
in
nature.
one
is
either
convinced
of
the
truth
of
that
world
view,
or
one
is
not.
just
as
there
is
a
marxist
world
view,
there
is
a
libertarian
world
view,
there
are
a
number
of
world
views,
and
one
is
either
convinced
of
the
truth
of
those
world
views
or
not,
and
those
world
views
have
application
to
numerous
issues,
such
as
the
questions
that
are
addressed
in
this
magazine.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
your
honor,
i
can
imagine
situations
in
which
the
government
might
be
operating
according
to
formally
neutral
criteria
that
have
such
disproportionate
effects
that
one
suspects
that
there's
a
religious
gerrymander
going
on.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
each
of
the
parochial
school
cases
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
point
out
that
the
category,
ostensibly
neutral,
private
schools,
is
a
category
that
in
fact
contained
overwhelmingly
religious
schools,
and
more
than
that,
overwhelmingly
religious
schools
of
one
particular
religious
denomination.
and
i
think
that
those
cases
can
be
understood
as
the
court's
reaction
to...
not
to
aid
which
is
general
in
nature
to
viewpoints
of
all
sorts,
but
rather
to
aid
which
the
legislature
knew,
everyone
knew,
this
court
knew,
was
being
enacted
in
response
to
the
needs
of
a
particular...
to
religion
in
general,
but
especially
to
one
particular
religious
denomination.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
your
honor
no.
i
think
that
it's
appropriate
to
look
at
the
effects
of
the
government's
action.
that
is,
if
the
government
is
drawing
categories
that
have
disproportionate
effect,
thus
leaving
us
room
to
suspect
that
there's
a
religious
gerrymander
going
on,
we
should
look
at
effects
in
that
sense,
but
just
as
in
widmar
v.
vincent,
this
court
was
not
concerned
with
the
students
benefiting
from
free
facilities
at
the
university
might
try
to
gain
members,
or
recruit
people
to
the
presbyterian
church,
or
whatever.
all
that
mattered
to
this
court
was
that
all
groups,
all
student
groups
at
the
university
of
missouri
were
being
given
an
equality
of
free
speech
rights,
and
that
is
our
position
here.
i
might...
on
this...
on
the
question
of
the
political
groups,
i
just
want
to
remind
the
court
of
one
thing.
i'm
not
sure
that
our
position
depends
in
any
sense
upon
whether
the
university
is
allowing
or
disallowing
the
republicans,
because
remember
in
lamb's
chapel,
two
terms
ago,
a
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
that
the
school...
that
the
policy
at
issue,
there,
expressly
allowed
political
activities
as
well
as...
and
excluded
religious
activities.
the--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
closest
case
to
that
is
the
witters
decision,
in
which
direct
cash
payments
were
made
for
vocational
education
at
the
inland
empire
school
for
bible
for
courses
in
biblical
studies
and
training
to
become
a
minister.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
the
university
of
virginia
is
not
channeling
money
to
religious
groups.
it
is
trying
to
support
the
activity
of
students
writing
and
editing
and
distributing
newspapers.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
and
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
urge
you
that
that
is
in
fact
a
very
close
parallel,
because...
and
there
the
state
was
supporting
vocational
education.
here,
the
state
is
supporting
student
journalism,
and
in
both
cases
the
state
is
completely,
or
should
be,
completely
indifferent
as
to
whether
the
individuals
who
benefit
or
participate
in
those
programs
themselves
decide
to
participate,
to
use
those
benefits
in
a
way
that
participates
in
a
religious
activity,
because
the
establishment--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--but,
your
honor,
the
very
activity
in
witters
was
a
religious
activity,
too.
witters
was
engaged
in
learning
about...
he
was
studying
a
religion,
in
a
deeply,
pervasively
religious
way.
the
point
is
that
the
establishment--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--yes.
to
use
this
court's
words
in
texas
monthly,
when
a
subsidy
is
distributed
to
a
broad
array
of
organizations,
both
religions
and
secular
on
the
basis
of
objective
criteria,
the
fact
that
some
of
the
aid
may
go
to
religious
advocacy
does
not
violate
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
right.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
but
here,
of
course,
there
is
an
extraordinarily
broad
array
of
groups.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
if
a
group--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--i
do
not
think--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--no,
your
honor,
because
in
order
to
administer
that
category,
money
to
morally
uplifting
groups,
the
government
would
have
to
decide
whether
a
religious
group
is
in
fact
morally
uplifting.
i
fully
agree
that
such
an
inquiry
on
the
part--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--of
the
government
is
unconstitutional.
here,
the
only
thing
that
the
government
has
to
determine
is--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
your
honor,
in
lamb's
chapel,
the--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--your
honor,
so
much
depends
upon...
it
depends
upon
the
practice
with
which
such
a
category
was
administered.
if,
in
fact,
that
meant
that
virtually
anyone
who
espoused
any
views
that
was
remotely
related
to
the
good
life
received
money,
i
think
that
would
be
fine,
but
if
in
fact
it
meant
that
the
government
was
engaged
in
a
searching,
case-by-case
inquiry,
deciding
this
group
promotes
the
moral
life
and
this
group
doesn't,
then
that
kind
of
selective
funding
i
think
would
be
unconstitutional,
and
religious
groups
could
not
be
included,
because
then
the
government
would
be
putting
its
imprimatur
upon
particular
religious
views
and
saying
these
are
good
views.
here,
the
only
thing
that's
going
on
is
that
the
government
has
found
that
this
is
a
student
news,
opinion,
entertainment,
or
academic
media
group.
that
is
not
an
entangling
form
of
category.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the...
where
the
tax
code
has
exempted...
provides
tax
exemptions
for
essentially
the
entire
nonprofit
charitable
world,
if
there
were
an
exclusion
of
charities
that
espoused
religious
views,
i
think
that
i
would
be
here
contending
that
that's
unconstitutional.
the...
as
i
was
saying,
the
religious
nature
of
the
students
is
what
makes
this
a
case
different
from
cases
that
even
the
university
concedes
are
correct
about
prohibiting
discrimination
on
the
part
of
viewpoint.
now,
there
are
two
ways
in
which
the
religious
character
of
their
viewpoint
might
be
considered
relevant.
one
is
the
university's
position,
which
is
to
draw
the
line
between
religious
and
nonreligious
is
not
viewpoint
discrimination.
because
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
plainly
foreclosed
by
this
court's
unanimous
decision
two
terms
ago
in
lamb's
chapel,
i
would
like
to
turn
instead
to
the
arguments
not
endorsed
by
the
university
today,
but
which
were
the
basis
of
the
fourth
circuit's
judgment
below.
that
is--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--your
honor,
i
think
it
would.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
your
honor,
absolutely
fundamental
to
our
position
is
the
distinction
between
the
government's
own
speech,
either
through
its
employees
or
through
grantees--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--yes,
but
even
with...
your
honor,
even
within
the
context
of
a
state
university,
the
state
university
is
in
some
cases
speaking
itself,
and
in
other
cases
it
is
providing
a
platform
or
a
means
for
private
speakers
to
be
able
to
speak
their
own
minds.
that
distinction
is
central
to
our
position,
and
it
is
our
view
that
the
free
speech
clause
protects
private
speech
where
the
content
and
viewpoint
are
initiated
by
the
private
speakers,
that
it
protects
private
speech
against
viewpoint-based
discrimination
whether
it's...
the
speech
is
religious
or
nonreligious.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
we
absolutely
agree
that
the
university,
that
the
government,
when
it
chooses
to
present
its
own
message
through
private
speakers
by
funding
those
speakers
on
account
of
their
espousing
the
government's
message,
that
in
those
cases
the
government's...
the
government
may
take
a
viewpoint.
it
can
espouse
an
antismoking
campaign
without
funding
a
prosmoking
campaign.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
the
university
has
been
completely
clear
that
in
its
funding
of
student
groups
it
means
it
does
not
endorse
the
groups,
it
does
not
agree
with
them,
it
doesn't
even
allow
them
to
use
the
university
of
virginia's
logo.
it
has
separated
itself
to
the
maximum
possible
extent
from
the
content
of
these
groups,
and
of
course,
the
groups
themselves
that
are
funded--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--i--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--your
honor,
and
they've
made
the
further
determination
that
the...
that
writing
a
student
newspaper
is
an
educational
activity.
that
is,
the
act
of
writing,
editing,
distributing,
reading,
engaging
in
ideas,
is
itself
an
educational
activity,
not
because
the
content
of
the
newspaper
is
educational,
but
because
the
activity
of
engaging
in
student
journalism
is
itself
educational.
that's
why
you
can
have
an
animal
rights
oriented
newspaper,
and
you
can
have
a
meant-eaters
oriented
newspaper
on
the
same
campus.
it
isn't
that
one
of
those
views
is
better
than
the
other,
it's
that
the
participation
in
this
activity
is
itself
educational.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
the
lower
courts
have
been
split
on
these
questions,
and
some
have
said
yes,
but
they
have
said
yes
with
regard
to
controversial
political
speech,
too,
so
that
a
person
opposed
to
abortion
is
not
required
to
contribute,
or
may
get
their
portion
of
the
student
activity
fee
back
that
goes
to
the
prochoice
campaign.
there's
been
no
distinction
between
controversial
religious
and
political
speech.
now,
other
courts
have
upheld
these
programs
and
not
allowed
a
right
to
refund
on
the
theory
that
so
long
as
the
university
is
funding
a
broad
array
of
viewpoints
of
all
sorts
that
no
student
is
being
required
to
support
any
particular
viewpoint,
and
that
it's
much
like,
you
know,
taxpayers
supporting
postal
subsidies,
or
supporting
public
libraries
that
contain
books
that
they
don't
agree
with.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
your
honor,
all
the
courts
that
have
accepted
this
claim
have
in
fact
allowed
students
to
object
to
controversial
political
claims,
though
all
of
the
cases
have
involved
secular
speech,
and
in
cases
like
aboud
in
this
court,
this
court
has
recognized
a
right
of
people
not
to
be
compelled
to
support
secular
speech
with
which
they
disagree.
in
this
context,
religious
and
secular
speech,
it
seems
to
me,
are
the
same.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
the
university
should
be
required
to
give
refunds
or
not.
i'd
be
perfectly
content
for
objecting
students
to
receive
refunds
if
they
object
to
some
of
the
speech.
the
point
is
that
the
university
may
not
use
its
power
to
skew
the
marketplace
of
ideas
at
the
university
of
virginia
by
favoring
some
viewpoints
over
others.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
if
individual
students
want
to
do
that,
fine.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
say
never,
but
i
would
say
that
where
citizens
have
a
free
speech
or
free
press
right,
a
constitutional
right
under
the
first
amendment,
the
university
can't...
cannot
defeat
that
right
or
deny
that
right
on
the
basis
of
some
nebulous
fear
of
violating
another
provision
of
the
constitution.
indeed,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
to
me
why
one
clause
of
the
constitution
should
be
read
to
trump
the
other
clause
to
begin
with.
it
seems
to
me
much
more
sensible
to
take
a
step
back
and
look
at
how
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
speech
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause
can
be
read
as
a
consistent
and
harmonious
whole,
all
of
them
designed
to
guarantee
a
neutrality
between
religion
and
its
various
ideological
competitors
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas.
so
that
that
way,
instead
of
having
the
strange
situation
in
the
fourth
circuit
where
the...
where
my
clients
were
held
to
have
had
a
free
speech
right
but
the
establishment
clause
trumps
that
right,
instead,
the
enterprise
of
the
first
amendment
can
be
interpreted
in
a
consistent
fashion.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
just
like
to
conclude
with
a
practical
observation
about
the
real
impact
of...
on
free
speech
of
the
government's
use
of
the
power
of
the
purse.
effectively,
ronald
rosenberger
and
his
fellow
students
were
enabled
to
put
together
a
newspaper,
and
there's
a
carrot
dangling
in
front
of
them,
and
the
carrot
has
attached
to
it
something
about
their
speech,
that
they
can
address
issues
if
they
want
to,
but
if
they
want
to
receive
the
carrot,
they
have
to
do
them
in
a
particular
way.
they
have
to
censor
their
own
religious
viewpoints,
they
have
to
make
sure
that
they
don't
quote
from
one
book,
the
bible.
they
could
quote
from
others.
they
have
to--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--your
honor,
if
their
viewpoint
were
secular,
they're
certainly
entitled
to
write
a
magazine
saying,
this
is
our
viewpoint,
and
you
should
share
that
viewpoint.
animal
rights
groups
are
doing
precisely
that.
feminist
groups
are
doing
precisely
that.
every
other
group
is
permitted
to
proselytize,
which
i'd
just
like
to
note
is
nothing
but
an
ugly
word
for
persuade,
which
is
just
exactly
what
the
free
speech
clause
is
designed
to
protect.
