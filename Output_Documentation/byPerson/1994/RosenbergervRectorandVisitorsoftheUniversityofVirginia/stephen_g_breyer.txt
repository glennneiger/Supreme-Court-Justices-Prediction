what
prevents
the...
are
you
saying
the
constitution
would
prevent
the
university
from
deciding
to
teach
buddhism
unless
they
also
wanted
to
teach
hinduism,
or
the
university's
newspaper,
edited
by
students,
to
decide
that
they
want
to
print
liberal
articles
but
not
conservative
articles,
or
articles
involving,
say,
buddhists
but
not
hindus,
or
whatever?
i
mean,
how
does
that
interest
in
a
university
to
edit,
decide
how
it
spends
its
money,
or
decide
what's
important
for
students
to
hear,
how
does
that
fit
in
to
your
first
amendment
analysis?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
these
are
state
universities.
i'm
assuming
state
universities.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
they
say
that
they're
doing
is,
they're
funding
educational
activities
by
students,
and
they
don't
want
to
fund
noneducational
activities.
why
can't
they
do
that?
do
they
have
to
fund
every
activity?
i
mean,
why
can't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
giving
of
religious
instruction
a
religious
activity
that
calls...
makes
it
outside
the
funding?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
for
example,
if
what...
this
magazine
has
articles
in
it
that
says
christianity
and
the
five-legged
stool,
and
then
it
says,
for
example,
how
you
should
lead
a
holy
life,
spread
the
gospel,
make
social
justice,
follow
the
holy
spirit,
and
pursue
intellectual
excellence,
all
of
which
are
fine,
but
is
that
type
of
article
the
kind
of
article
that
falls
outside
funding,
and
why,
precisely?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
i
mean,
the
character
of
the
magazine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
magazine
did
not
have
such
articles,
but
only
said,
we
have
a
religious
point
of
view
involving
certain
social
issues,
certain
educational
issues.
would
it
then
qualify
for
funding?
i'm
trying
to
get
the
distinction
as
to
what
makes
it
a
religious
activity
and
what
doesn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
terms
of
this
magazine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
there's
a
magazine
put
out
by
hobbyists,
or
by
fraternities,
and
the
magazine
has
some
articles
devoted
to
how
wonderful
it
is
to
live
at
theta
beta
whatever,
or
how
to
build
model
air
planes,
but
several
other
articles
have
to
do
with
issues
on
campus
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
fraternity,
or
issues
on
campus
from
the
point
of
view
of
model
airplane
builders.
now,
does
that
get
funding,
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
a
group
of
people
who
happen
to
belong--
[laughter]
--to
fraternities,
or
they
build
model
airplanes,
and
what
they
do
is,
they
put
out
the
magazine
i
was
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
for
example
you
have
a
person
who
does...
a
republican
and
a
democrat
and
an
episcopal
minister
all
give
exactly
the
same
speech
about
the
homeless
problem,
one
from
a
republican
point
of
view,
one
democratic,
and
one
says
i'm
a
minister
and
i
have
my
own
experience.
the
speeches
are
identical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
fund
the
first
two
but
not
the
third.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
write
it
a
news...
they
write
it
in
a
little
magazine.
