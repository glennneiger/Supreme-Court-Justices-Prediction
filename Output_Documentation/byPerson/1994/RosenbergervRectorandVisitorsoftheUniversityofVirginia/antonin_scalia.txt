what
if
they
were
republicans?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
mcconnell,
there
are
two
bases
for
exclusion
of
religious
publications.
one
is
if
the
organization
practices
religion...
i
mean,
if
it's
a
prayer
group,
or
something
like
that...
and
then
there's
a
separate
one
if
the
publication
exhibits
religious
belief?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
latter
does
not
apply
to
the
political
exclusion.
if
you
exhibit
the
belief
of
a
republican,
your
publication
is
not
necessarily
excluded,
although
if
you
are
a
republican,
young
republicans
or
something
like
that,
you
would
be
excluded.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
for
religions,
if
you
are
either
a
religious
group
or
you
exhibit
religious
belief,
you're
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
acknowledge
that
the
young
republicans
would
still
be
excluded,
that
that
exception
would
not
let
the
young
republicans
run
a
newspaper
that
espouses
republican
views.
they
would
be
excluded
as
a
republican
political
organization,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
i'm
just
asking
about
the
young
republicans.
you
acknowledge
the
young
republicans
would
not
be
able
to
publish
a
magazine
of
republican
viewpoints.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
any
other
organization,
if
it's
not
a
republican
organization,
would
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
it's
a
gerrymander.
you
do
make
that
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
have
it
at
a
very
general
level,
but
if,
in
fact,
the
way
it
winds
up
is
that
all
the
money
is
going
to
one
sect,
that
might
be
a
different
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
a
good
idea,
too,
if
you
read
some
of
them,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
as
i
understand,
mr....
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
is
that
different
from
a
group
that
is
not
trying
to
recruit
people
to
a
particular
christian
sect,
but
simply
espousing
the
truthfulness
of
certain
christian
doctrines,
just
as
this
other
group,
while
not
trying
to
get
you
to
vote
for
a
particular
candidate,
is
espousing
the
truthfulness
of
that
candidate's
position
on
a
lot
of
issues?
i
don't
see
a
distinction.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
different
things.
i'm
talking
about
refusing
to
fund
for
religious
publications
simply
the
espousal
of
general
ideas,
without
identification
of
a
particular
sect,
without
proselytizing,
whereas
in
the
political
context,
so
long
as
you
don't
proselytize,
so
long
as
you're
not
electioneering,
it's
okay.
why
is
it...
why
is
there
that
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
acknowledge
that
they
make
that
distinction.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you
used
to
say
the
reason
they
make
it
is,
the
establishment
clause
made
us
do
it,
but
you're
not
taking
that
position
today,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
a
church,
though.
i
mean,
if
you're...
you
know,
if
your
point
were,
we
will
not
fund
any
church
organization
that
publishes
something,
that's
fine,
but
that's
not
what
these
guidelines
say.
it
says,
any
organization
that
espouses
that
viewpoint.
what's
the
term
it
uses?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
manifests
a
particular
belief
in
or
about
a
deity,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
your
guidelines
say,
manifests
a
particular
view.
if
you
primarily
manifest
a
particular
view
relating
to,
in
or
about
a
deity,
you're
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
proselytizing.
that's
not
what
the
guideline
says.
it
says,
manifests,
promotes
or
manifests.
now,
suppose
you
had
a
magazine
that
just
said,
we
want
to
set
forth
the
christian
or
the
muslim
or
the
jewish
point
of
view
on
social
issues.
it's
called,
commentary.
you
know--
[laughter]
--student
commentary,
or
something
like
that.
it's
all
about
social
issues,
but
it
intends
to
bring
a
distinctively,
to
manifest
a
distinctively
religious
point
of
view
about
all
the
social
issues.
wouldn't
that
be
covered
by
you
guideline?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
really
help
these
people
out
and
even
the
playing
field
by
not
distributing
your
student
activity
subsidies
in
cash,
just
provide
printing
presses
for
all
these
organizations.
then
it
would
be
okay
to
give
these
people
what
they
want.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
could
say,
because
there's
a
shortage
of
space
we're
going
to
decide
religious
organizations
are
at
the
end
of
the
line?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
widmar
stands
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
you're
picking
out
theology.
i
don't
know
that
you
would
try
to
justify
the
exclusion
of
some
other
area
of
thought,
or
discussion,
or
belief,
by
saying,
we're
excluding
this
entire
area,
both
those
who
like
it
and
those
who
don't
like
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
think
that's
a
major
step,
a
major--
justice
antonin
scalia
--additional
step?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
step
between
providing
a
classroom
and
providing
the
money
to
rent
a
classroom
you
think
is
really--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
step
off
a
cliff.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
classrooms
are
bought
with
budget
money,
certainly.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
affect
the
fisc.
i
can
understand
how
those
who
are
interested
in
a
balanced
budget
may
be
concerned
with
that
distinction,
but
i
don't
know
how
those
who
are
interested
in
unconstitutional
support
of
religion
see
a
great
difference
between
providing
that
assistance
in
cash
or
that
assistance
in
some
other...
in
some
other
means,
whether
it's
cost-free
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
a
finding
of
proselytizing
intent
as
the
basis
for
the...
i
don't
find
that
anywhere
in
the
record.
i
think
manifest
means
manifest.
do
you
mean
that
it
would
be
okay
if
this
group
said,
we're
not
going
to
try
to
convert
anybody,
we
just
want
to
explain
why
christian
viewpoint
provides
certain
consequences
on
a
whole
range
of
public
issues?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
be
accepted?
the
university
will
accept
that
publication?
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
to
say
yes
if
you're
going
to
answer
justice
souter
the
way
you
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
university
would...
who
wrote
these
regulations
for
the
university,
then?
the
university
would
consider
that
that...
such
a
publication
does
not
manifest
a
particular
belief?
it's
whole
basis
is,
christianity
provides
these
answers
to
a
whole
range
of
certain...
that
magazine
does
not
manifest
a
particular
belief?
