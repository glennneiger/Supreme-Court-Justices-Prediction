o'connor
well,
mr.
mcconnell,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
i
think
fits
into
this
same
line
of
inquiry?
you
argue
for
an
overarching
principle
of
neutrality,
and
you
say,
if
we
will
look
at
the
program
and
see
if
it's
neutral,
that
should
be
the
test,
and
do
you
think
that
means
that
government
must
never
single
out
religion
in
legislating,
or
do
you
think
that
the
constitutionality
of
a
program
under
the
establishment
clause
depends
on
its
effects,
its
overall
effects
with
respect
to
religion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
some
of
our
school
funding
cases
fall
in
that
category,
where
the
court
spoke
in
terms
of
well,
if
we
support
this,
95
percent
of
the
schools
that
will
benefit
are
religious
schools,
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
if
the
student
publication
in
question
were
really
a
mechanism
of
getting
more
members
for
the
presbyterian
church,
for
example,
then
you
think
it's
appropriate
to
look
at
the
effects
of
the
publication?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mcconnell,
would
your
theory
mean
that
the
case
of
regan
v.
taxation
with
representation
have
to
be
decided
differently
if
the
tax
code
provided
that
organizations
engaging
in
religious
activities
would
not
be
able
to
receive
tax
deductible
contributions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
maybe
the
government
wants
to
sponsor
and
speak
through
the
views
of
private
people
but
only
on
subjects
that
the
government
wants
spoken
about.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
possibly
what's
going
on
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
based
on
viewpoint,
i
take
it.
you
would
agree
with
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
this
boils
down
to
whether
this
is
a
viewpoint
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
activity
involves
a
controversial
speaker
and
providing
facilities
to
take
care
of
that?
that
can
cost
a
lot
of
money.
i'm
not
sure
that
providing
access
to
facilities
is
cost-free.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
might
not
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
the
first
amendment
would
indicate
that
if
you
have
to
restrict
access
it
ought
to
be
on
some
neutral
ground.
we're
not
going
to
provide
access
if
to
do
so
requires
us
to
spend
a
lot
of
money.
