justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
just
the
question
i
was
going
to
ask.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
to
help
me
a
little
more
on
this
question.
i
thought...
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me.
i
thought
there
was
a
provision
that
did
exclude
political
groups
such
as
republicans
and
democrats.
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
not
the
rule
that
you
are
arguing
for
entitle
such
a
political
group
also
to
get
funding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcconnell,
the
religious
provision
to
which
justice
scalia
refers
is
an
activity
which
primarily
promotes
or
manifests
a
political
belief
in
and
about
a
deity
or
an
ultimate
reality.
that's
the
provision
you
say
is
the
equivalent
of
exhibiting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
see,
and
the
political
one
is
an
organization
primarily
involved,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
i
don't
see
the
dramatic
difference
between
the
two
provisions
that
you
rely
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
you.
you
agree
that
a
republican
publication
would
be
prohibited
by
the
guidelines.
do
you
also
agree
that
it
may
constitutionally
be
prohibited
by
the
guidelines?
