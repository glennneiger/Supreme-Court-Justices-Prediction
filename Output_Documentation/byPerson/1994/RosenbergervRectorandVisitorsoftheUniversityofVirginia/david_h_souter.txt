justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
agree
that
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
to
deny
funding
to
a
publication
that
says,
vote
republican
in
the
next
election?
justice
david
h.
souter
those
other
newspapers
are
not
affiliated
with
an
identified
partisan
organization,
i
suppose,
or
at
least
in
theory
they're
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
virginia
advocate
is
not
a
church.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
if
they
were
circulating
coupons,
sign
up
for
membership
in
the
first
presbyterian
church,
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
one
thing...
it
seems
to
me
the
distinction
is
made,
it's
one
thing
to
recruit
members
of
one's
organization,
as
such,
and
it's
another
thing
to
recruit
adherence
to
god,
to
religious
tenets.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
admit
the
distinction,
don't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
a
distinction
in
this
case,
because
the
claim
is
that
the
very
nature
of
the
publication
itself
is
an
espousal
of
religion.
it
is,
in
your
phrase,
a
religious
activity,
so
there's
nothing
left
to
chance
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
your
point
that
so
long
as
the
criterion
for
giving
out
the
aid
is
at
a
sufficiently
high
level
of
generality
that
it
does
not
identify
religious
purpose
as
its
object,
e.g.,
funds
for
education,
funds
for
publications,
that
that
is
the
end
of
the
inquiry
about
a
possible
establishment
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
on
your
criterion,
then,
if
the
state
were
to
dispense
funds
for
moral
betterment,
it
could
make
direct
cash
payments
to
any
organized
religious
group.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
that
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--consequence
of
what
you
just
said?
you
said,
if
the
level
of
generality
is
high
enough
so
that
we
know
the
object,
absent
a
gerrymander,
is
not
a
peculiarly
religious
object,
that
makes
it
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--let's
make
it
a
little
easier.
instead
of
saying,
as
you
were
putting
it,
morally
uplifting,
those
which
simply
espouse
the
pursuit
of
action
based
on
moral
grounds.
one
ought
to
act
morally
responsibly.
that's
the
only
criterion.
that
isn't
going
to
require
very
much
by
way
of
inquiry,
and
i
take
it
on
your
reasoning
that
direct
cash
payments
could
be
made
to
any
church
group
on
that
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
lamb's
chapel,
what
about
your
theory?
isn't
it
the
case
that
on
your
theory
the
direct
payments
could
be
made?
justice
david
h.
souter
before
you
do
that,
may
i
just
ask
you
one
question
about
your
understanding
of
the
way
the
regulation
would
apply?
would
funding
be
denied,
as
the
reg
is
written,
to
an
organization
espousing
atheism?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
secular
humanism
says,
we
take
this
position
because
all
religion
is
rot,
you
wouldn't
fund
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
i
go
to
a
question
peculiar
to
funds?
your
opponents
say
that
your
argument
there
is
specious,
because
you
rely
upon
cases
in
which
the
government
is
deciding,
as
it
were,
to
speak
for
itself,
and
it
can
decide
what
speech
to
make,
whereas
the
university
of
virginia
is
not
speaking
for
itself,
it
is
funding
the
speech
of
others,
and
it
is
because
of
that
distinction
that
it
cannot
make
the
distinctions
that
you
draw.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
effect
you're
saying,
any
subject
matter
distinction
can
be
made,
and
it
doesn't
matter
at
the
point
in
time,
or
the
point
in
the
legislative
process
at
which
the
government
says,
this
is
my
speech
as
distinct
from,
this
is
what
i
will
pay
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
isn't
it
the
case
that
when
you
were
using
religious
speech
in
this
argument,
and
when
virginia
is
deciding
what
it
means
to
fund,
specifically
when
virginia
uses
the
word
manifest,
aren't
you,
in
each
instance,
talking
about
speech
which
does
not
merely
explain
a
point
of
view,
but
espouses
it,
speech
which
in
effect
recognize
the
difference
between,
this
is
a
way
of
thinking,
and
speech
which
says,
this
ought
to
be
your
way
of
thinking.
isn't
that
the
distinction
that
is
implicit
in
your
entire
argument,
and
in
these
guidelines
as
you
read
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
but
in
theory,
it
would.
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
be
tough
to
identify
it
as
one
or
the
other,
but
the
distinction
is
a
distinction
that
the
university
would
honor,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
think
that's
what
your
brother
is
saying.
i
think
what
your
brother
is
saying
is,
they
cannot
cross
that
line
between
saying,
this
is
the
christian
viewpoint,
and
this
ought
to
be
your
viewpoint.
now,
that
may
be
a
tough
line
to
draw.
he
certainly
admits
it.
but
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
only
censorship
that
we're
talking
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
like
the
word
manifest.
[laughter]
