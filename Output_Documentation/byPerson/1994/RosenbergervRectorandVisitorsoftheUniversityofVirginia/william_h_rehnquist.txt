we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-329,
ronald
w.
rosenberger
v.
the
rector
and
visitors
of
the
university
of
virginia.
mr.
mcconnell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mcconnell.
mr.
jeffries.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jeffries,
take
a
look
at...
on
page
66a
of
the
petition,
the
number
3
parenthetical
in
the
carryover
paragraph
on
page...
where
it's
talking
about
political
activity,
and
apparently
excepted
are
student
organizations
which
espouse
particular
positions
or
ideological
viewpoints.
that
would
not
include
political
positions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
suppose
you
have
a
newspaper
that
simply
espouses
the
republican
point
of
view,
or
the
democratic
point
of
view.
just
as
a
more
or
less...
liberal
versus
conservative,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
but
it
has
party
identification.
is
that
permitted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
some
might
say
the
americans
for
democratic
action,
or
something,
a
liberal
group
which
consistently
supports
democratic
candidates
but
doesn't
really
electioneer
for
them,
they
could
be
funded?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
there
a
difference
between
when
the
university
decides,
you
know,
what
kinds
of
subjects
to
teach,
say,
in
its
department
of
religion,
where
it's
putting
out
its
own
message,
and
where
the
university
says,
we're
going
to
fund
all
sorts
of
student
activities,
and
we're
going
to
disassociate
ourselves
from
their
message?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
aren't
devoted
to
espousing
something
that
might
be
called,
the
university's
point
of
view,
or
the
university's
idea
of
what
education
should
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
according
to
a
case
like
widmar
v.
vincent,
where
you're
talking
about
student
activities
like
this,
you
can't
exclude
religion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
providing
space,
or
facilities
and
lighting
and
so
forth,
in
doing
that
the
university
can't
discriminate,
but
if
instead
of
that
it
decides
to
make
cash
payments,
it
can?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
relying
on
justice
stevens'
separate
opinion
in
widmar
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
the
university
of
missouri
in
widmar
have
said,
we're
going
to
deny
access
to
this
religious
group
to
these
rooms,
and
we're
also
going
to
deny
access
to
any
antireligious
group,
but
we're
going
to
give
it
to
everybody
else?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
court
opinion
in
widmar
stress
those
facts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jeffries.
mr.
mcconnell,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcconnell.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
