paul

isn't
that
kind
of
a
silly
approach?
if
congress
wanted
there
to
be
immunity
from
suit
in
federal
courts,
all
it
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
say
in
its
consent
there
should
be
immunity
from
suit
in
federal
court.
then
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
all
the
details
of
the
structure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
background
question?
you
mentioned
that
between
1922,
or
whenever
it
was
they
formed
this,
and
1951,
they
retained
their
sovereign
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
were
all...
all
those
were
new
york
and
new
jersey
cases,
were
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
did
a
person
injured
by
the
negligence
of
the
port
authority
do
during
that
period?
was
there
just
no
remedy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
resolutions
passed
by
whom?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
a
question
about
your...
you
earlier
explained
to
us
in
injunctive
actions
that
the
citizen
has
to
go
to
the
attorney
general
to
bring
the
action.
that,
of
course,
is
in
state
court
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
a
federal...
if
there
were
a
federal
question
such
as
whether
the
authority
had
violated
an
environmental
statute
or
something
like
that,
would
you
contend
the
same
procedure
had
to
be
followed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
federal
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
of
an
individual's
complaint
unless
the
individual
went
to
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
have
any
authority
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
talking
about
federal
court
actions
now,
but
you
couldn't
do
that
in
the
state
court,
i
don't
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
bar
would
apply
to
an
action
brought
against
an
officer
of
path
as
well
as
path
itself,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question,
since
i've
interrupted
you
already?
the
first
argument
that
we
made
in
our
opinion
for
the
court
in
the
lake
country
estate
was
a
plain
language
argument,
that
the
plain
language
of
the
eleventh
amendment
applies
to
suits
against
"any
one
state".
what's
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
that
in
the
lake
country
opinion
we
said
there
was,
based
on
the
plain
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there's
nothing
in
the
compact
that
would
justify
reading
additional
meaning
into
the
limited
language
of
the
amendment.
that's
at
page
401.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
think
there's
something
in
this
compact
that
justifies
a
departure
from
a
general
rule
that
the
eleventh
amendment
means
what
it
says.
