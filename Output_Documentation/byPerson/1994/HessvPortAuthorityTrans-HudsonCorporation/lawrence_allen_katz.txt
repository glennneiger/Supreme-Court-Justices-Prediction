mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
very
narrow
issue:
whether
the
port
authority,
a
compact
clause
entity,
and
path,
its
subsidiary,
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
this
court,
in
its
lake
country
decision,
instructed
that
compact
clause
entities
are
not
automatically
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
the
statute
creating
path
gives
it
all
the
rights
and
immunities
of
the
port
authority.
we
believe
that--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
we
believe
that
there
is
certainly
a
connection
between
the
port
authority
and
path
that
would
in
all
probability
permit
this
court
to
find
that
if
the
port
authority
is
entitled
to
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
it
is
likely
that
path
is
similarly,
because
their
structure
is
very
similar.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
yes,
your
honor.
we
don't
believe,
though,
that
the
port
authority
is
entitled
to
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
that's
correct.
there's
a
step
procedure
that
must
be
followed.
we
must
first
see
whether
or
not
path
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
port
authority,
and
then
the
constitutional
issue,
whether
the
port
authority
is
then
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
state.
technically--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--we
do,
because
by
statute
it
is
considered
the
same.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
the
only
thing
that
at
all
is
added
is
the
fact
that
the
discussion
relating
to
the
port
authority
in
several
instances
will
also
apply
to
path
because
the
same
compact
is
used
in
creating
the
rights
and
regulations
with
regard
to
both
under
state
law.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
justice
scalia,
i
would
agree
with
that.
i
believe
that
path,
because
of
the
nature,
acting
for
all
intents
and
purposes
as
a
private
business
owned
by
state
entities,
could
be
found
to
not
possess
eleventh
amendment
protection,
where,
if
the
court
was
so
inclined,
the
port
authority
could
be
found
to
possess
that
protection.
we
do
not
believe
that
is
the
case,
though.
we
believe
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
lake
country
decision,
and
the
importance
of
lake
country,
as
we
view
it,
is
the
fact
that
this
court
held
that
bi-state
compact
clause
entities
are
not
automatically
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
that
with
respect
to
these
compact
clause
entities,
the
limited
language
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
not
to
be
expansively
applied.
now,
with
both
regard
to
the
port
authority
and
path,
it
is
clear,
first
of
all,
that
neither
is
a
state,
it
is
also
equally
as
clear
that
neither
is
controlled
by
any
individual
sovereign
state
and,
finally,
it
is
clear
that
neither
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
any
individual
sovereign
state.
lake
country--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--a
state
or
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
state--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--that
would
show
the
relationship
between
them.
i
believe--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--that's
critical--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--to
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
justice
scalia,
i
would
have
to
know
how
those
international
agencies
are
structured.
if
they're
structured
similar
to
the
port
authority,
where
neither
state
on
its
own
can
compel
the
port
authority
to
act,
then
i
would
say
that
under
an
analogous
situation
the
same
result
should
apply
as--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--we
seek
here.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
well,
no,
i
don't
think
that
opec
is
covered
by
the
eleventh
amendment
at
all.
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
apply.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
your
honor,
i
must
be--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--your
honor,
i
would
have
to
plead
ignorance
to
opec,
because
i'm
not
certain
as
to
their
structure.
if
they
are
structured
so
that
there
is
a
direct
relationship
between
any
individual
member,
any
individual
nation,
and
opec--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--if
the
consent
of
all
the
states
are
necessary,
then
using
an
eleventh
amendment
analysis,
i
would
contend
that
opec
is
not
protected
by
the
eleventh
amendment
or
the
analogous
international
law.
what's
very
important
to--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--well,
we
believe
that
this
court
has
indicated
that
the
significant
factor
to
look
at
is
in
fact
what's
been
called
the
treasury
factors.
it's
a
flip
side.
where
does
the
money
come
from,
and
are
the
states
liable
to
it?
we
take
the
position
that
it
is
the
most
important
factor
because
of
this
court's
language
in
lake
country.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
that
is
not
correct,
justice
o'connor.
it
is,
in
fact,
the
fundamental
error
of
the
third
circuit
decision
below.
compact
article
xv
says
that
the
port
authority
can
request
funding
for
certain
administrative
expenses
and
if
the
legislatures
of
both
states
approve
that
funding
with
the
approval
of
the
governor.
the
problem
below
in
the
third
circuit
was
that,
when
they
quoted
the
statute,
when
they
quoted
compact
article
xv,
they
ignored
the
language,
with
the
approval
of
the
governor.
there
is
no
way
that
the
states
can
be
compelled
to
contribute
funds.
it's
a
totally
discretionary
act.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
even
up
to
the
$100,000.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
that
money
goes
to
a
general
surplus
revenue
fund.
that
money
is
available
for
the
cooperative
states
for
use,
but
we
submit
that
the
statute
does
not
permit...
and
justice
o'connor,
if
i
might,
this
is
why
the
fact
that
the
port
authority
is
a
compact
clause
entity
is
pivotal
in
this
case.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
the
state
of
new
york
or
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
their
own
entity
that
they
can
control.
in
this
case,
the
extra
reserves
in
the
fund
stay
in
that
fund
unless
both
states
cooperate
and
agree
to
their
expenditures.
if
from
this
day
until
the
end
of
the
world
the
states
of
new
jersey
and
new
york
cannot
agree
on
how
that
money
is
spent,
it
will
stay
there.
if
the--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--on
its
face,
your
honor,
it
certainly
appears
that
way.
that's
simply
not
constitutionally
accurate.
the
reason
that
two
states
are
not
better
than
one
state,
for
lack
of
a
better
phrase,
is
the
compact
clause
itself.
in
a
single
state
entity,
any
individual
state
can
compel
the
entity
to
act.
no
two--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--can
do
so.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
a
tradition--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--by
entering
into
this
federal
system,
your
honors,
the
founding
states
and
all
subsequent
states
have
as
part
of
the
plan
to
the
convention,
as
part
of
the
compact
clause,
changed
their
role
with
respect
to
interstate
compact
entities.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
sovereign
states,
on
their
own...
sovereign
colonies
before
this
constitution
was
enacted...
had
the
ability
to
create
entities,
had
the
ability
to
form
coalitions.
when
they
joined
the
union,
they
approved
the
compact
clause,
and
today,
a
sovereign...
today,
a
state
does
not
have
the
sovereign
power
to
create
a
compact
clause
entity
without
the
approval
of
the
congress.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
they
don't
have
sovereign
immunity
any
longer
because
the
practical
day-to-day
realities
of
bi-state
compact
entities
is
that
the
states
cannot
exercise
their
sovereign
control
over
the
entity.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
no,
your...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
not
saying
that.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
a
bi-state
entity,
structured
as
the
port
authority
is
structured,
does
not
have
the
ability
to
claim
the
eleventh
amendment.
it
is
possible--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--no,
on
the
contrary.
i
believe
that
the
burden
that
a
bi-state
entity
has
to
show
in
order
to
establish
that
it's
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
stronger
because
of
its
unique
role
in
our
constitutional
system.
bi-state
entities
require
not
only
the
cooperation
of
the
other
states,
but
the
concurrence
of
congress.
i
believe
there's--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--i
believe
implicit
in
lake
country
is
the
underlying
factor
that
this
is
a
compact
clause
entity,
and
for
that
reason,
the
court
was
not
willing
to
extend
the
eleventh
amendment
protection
any
further
than
it
did.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
that
would
be
correct,
but
i
believe
the
burden
of
proof
is
stronger
with
a
multi-state
entity.
justice
ginsburg,
responding
to
the
question
that
you
asked
earlier,
we
believe
that
the
treasury
factors
are
the
most
important
factor
to
look
at,
and
the
reason
it's
the
most
important
factor
is
that
in
lake
country
this
court
explained
that
the
reason
that
some
entities
who
are
not
the
state
itself
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
in
order
to
protect
the
state
treasury.
the
rationale
for
the
extension
from
state
to
entity
was
given
in
justice
stevens'
opinion
as
the
protection
of
state
treasuries.
in
an
eleventh
amendment
case,
it's
important
to
recognize
that
there's
a
two-step
process
involved.
the
first
step
is
whether
or
not
the
entity
is
entitled
to
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
second
step
is
then
whether
or
not
the
eleventh
amendment
applies
in
light
of
issues
such
as
abrogation
and
waiver.
in
that
first
step,
lake
country
and
other
decisions
of
this
court
emphasized
the
treasury
factor,
and
in
this
case,
the
treasury
factor
is
fully
supportive
of
the
proposition
that
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
apply
to
the
port
authority
and
path.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
i
apologize.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
the
answer
to
that
question--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--it
is
possible.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
in
response
to
the
first
question,
yes,
it
is
possible
for
the
states,
by
cooperative
decision
of
the
legislatures
and
their
governors,
to
share
the
general
revenue
fund.
yes,
there
are
situations
where
that
has
been
done,
and
i
believe
that
the
port
authority
has
cited
some
of
those
situations
in
their
brief.
by
the
same
token,
there
are
other
examples
where
an
individual
state,
seeking
to
pursue
what
it
believed
was
its
sovereign
policy,
wanted
to
take
that
money,
and
they
weren't
permitted
to
because
the
agreement
of
the
other
state
was
not
available.
it
is
that
situation,
the
practical
realities
that
once
they
cannot
act
on
its
own,
that
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
this
entity
cannot
be
sovereign,
is
not
entitled--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--mr.
chief
justice,
based
on
the
current
posture
of
this
case,
i
agree,
but
i
disagree
with
the
conclusion.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
let
me
give
you
an
example,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
my
position
is
that
any
entity
structured
as
the
port
authority
is
structured
is
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
i
believe
that
the
states
and
congress
concurring
could
create
a
statutory
framework
where
each
state
has
the
opportunity
to
either
exercise
some
control
or
dip
into
the
funds
themselves,
where
there
is
significant
sovereignty
exercised
by
the
states
and,
if
that
structure
did
exist,
those
entities
would
be
entitled
to
the
eleventh
amendment
protection.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
well,
justice
stevens,
we
believe
that's
another
argument
supporting
our
position
here,
that
in
fact
there's
nothing
in
the
compact
itself
to
indicate
that
the
states
intended
to
give
eleventh
amendment
immunity
to
this
entity.
lake
country--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--i
believe
that's
true.
i've
tackled
with
that
problem,
and
i'm
not
certain
there's
an
actual
difference
between
a
congressional
statute
precluding
these
cases
from
federal
court
and
the
ramifications
of
the
eleventh
amendment
precluding
them
from
federal
court.
the
effect
is
still
the
same,
and
i'm
not
certain
technically
which
would
have
applied.
i
think
the
significance,
though,
is
that
lake
country
speaks
about
the
need
for
congressional
concurrence.
concurrence
indicates
the
need
to
agree
with
something.
if
the
compact
is
silent,
then
it's
clear
that
congress
did
not
concur,
and
without
congressional
concurrence,
the
suggestion
that
justice
stevens
raised,
the
hypothetical
that
he
raised,
could
not
exist
and
does
not
exist
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
let
me
make
certain
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
the
parties...
that
the
states
specifically
intended
to
confer
some
sort
of
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
in
federal
court
to
this
entity,
and
that
congress,
understanding
that
intention,
specifically
and
explicitly
concurred
with
it,
then
i
would
agree
that
under
federal
law,
article
iii
jurisdiction
would
not
vest
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
the
treasury
factor
is
an
extremely
relevant,
the
most
relevant
factor
in
the
analysis
on
the
constitutional
issue.
the
statutory
issue
is
a
totally
different
approach.
such
a
statute
does
not
exist
in
this
case.
there
is
no
specific
congressional
concurrence
for
protection
from
suit
in
federal
court.
in
the
absence
of
that,
the
only
issue
that
remains
is
the
eleventh
amendment
issue,
and
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
looks
primarily
to
the
treasury
factors.
i
believe
there's
another
important
factor--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--none
at
all,
your
honor.
the
reason
we
must
address
the
treasury--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--that's
right.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
port
authority
is
such
a
state
agency,
and
in
determining
that
question,
lake
country
and
other
cases
indicate
reliance
on
the
treasury
factor.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
justice
scalia,
let
me
address
another
factor,
then.
in
lake
country,
this
court
noted
that
the
most
forceful
evidence
of
autonomy
between
the
tahoe
agency
and
the
states
was
evidence
that
the
states
had
to
go
to
court
to
litigate
against
the
entity.
i
believe
that
that
factor
being
called
the
most
forceful
was
evidence
for
the
court's
position
that
actions
speak
louder
than
words,
that
regardless
of
what
the
port
authority
says
today,
let's
look
at
what
they
did.
in
this
case,
we
had
that
situation.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
went
into
court
to
compel
the
port
authority
to
stop
polluting
the
water
around
the
kennedy
airport.
the
judge
who
heard
that
injunction
hearing
noted
that
it
was
in
fact
unusual
that
the
port
authority,
being
a
quasi-state
agency
of
some
sort,
would
come
in
and
basically
take
the
position,
don't
enjoin
us,
we
should
be
able
to
pollute
the
water
because
we
don't
know
that
it's
our
pollution
that's
causing
the
damage.
now,
the
port
authority
in
their
reply
brief
indicates
that
the
presence
of
this
lawsuit
is
actually
some
indication
of
state
connection.
they
take
the
position
that
the
attorney
general
has
to
screen
these
suits,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
port
authority
is
related
to
the
state.
i
submit
that's
simply
not
true.
the
statute
gives
the
attorney
general
discretion.
if
not
polluting
the
waters
near
the
kennedy
airport
was
an
important
state
policy,
sufficiently
important
that
the
attorney
general
would
want
to
pursue
it,
and
in
his
discretion
decided
to
pursue
it
through
litigation,
then
if
the
port
authority
was
sufficiently
connected
to
the
state
to
make
it
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
state,
or
if
the
port
authority
was
subject
to
the
control
of
an
individual
state,
the
attorney
general
would
not
have
had
to
go
to
court.
it
could
have
been
handled
within
the
executive
branch.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
the
reason
that
eliminates
sovereign
immunity
unless
the
statutory
structure
gives
those
individual
states
some
independent
control
is
because
the
purpose
of
extending
sovereign
immunity
is
because
the
agency
is
derivative
of
the
sovereign.
in
this
case,
the
states
are
not
effectively
sovereign
as
to
this
entity,
because
it
can't
exercise
control
as
to
that
entity.
if
today--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--only
if
they
had
the
authority
to
act
and
they
can
agree.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
personally,
i
believe,
justice
kennedy,
that
two
sovereigns
are
the
equivalent
of
no
sovereign
with
respect
to
a
bi-state
entity,
because
independently--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--they
cannot
exercise
control.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
because
i
don't
believe
that...
let
me
rephrase
that.
i
believe
that
the
court
would
take
the
position
that...
such
as
that
set
forth
in
the
concurrence
in
the
feeney
case
that
eleventh
amendment
immunity
should
never
apply
to
a
compact
clause
entity.
that
would
be
a
constitutionally
correct
decision.
i
do
not
believe
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
go
to
that
extreme
in
this
decision,
because
this
decision
can
be
reached
on
narrower
grounds
and
still
hold
the
constitutional
principles
of
the
compact
clause.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
may
i
say
two
things
in
response
to
that
question?
the
first
is,
there's
another
very
important
factor
of
the
treasury
test.
not
only
is
it
self-sustaining
in
terms
of
its
own
financial
ability,
but
its
debts
cannot
become
the
debts
of
the
compacting
states.
but
a
more
direct
response
to
your
question,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
port
authority
does
enrich
the
states,
because--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--i
believe
that
if
the
individual
states
had
the
authority
to
independently
take
money
out
of
that
surplus
fund
toward
its
own
use,
that
would
point
in
favor
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
it's
important
to
remember,
though,
that
if
either
the
state--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--i
believe
there
are
several
historical
examples
to
show
that
the
states
often
cannot
agree,
and
therefore...
the
concept
of
sovereign--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--absolutely,
but
the
concept
of
sovereign
is
that
the
sovereign
has
the
power
to
do
something.
the
state
of
new
york
does
not
have
the
power
to
take
this
money,
and
the
state
of
new
jersey
does
not
have
the
power
to
take
this
money.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
questions,
at
this
time
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
justice
ginsburg,
i'd
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
one
of
your
questions
to
mr.
welsh
concerning
the
difference
between
fitchik,
bolden,
and
this
case
and
police
benevolent.
i
believe
that
the
lake
country
decision
indicated
this
court's
instructions
that
the
treasury
factor,
while
not
necessarily
the
only
factor,
is
the
most
strongly
weighted
factor
in
determining
these
issues.
the
third
circuit
has
recognized
that
to
be
true,
as
is
evidenced
by
the
formula
that
it
follows
in
deciding
its
cases.
amici
for
the
port
authority
has
also
indicated
that
not
only
did
the
third
circuit
believe
that's
what
this
court
has
said
in
its
past
cases,
but
almost
every
other
circuit
has
agreed
the
same.
the
problem
with
this
case,
the
problem
with
the
police
benevolent
case,
and
the
reason
that
the
port
authority
has
been
handled
differently
than
the
other
entities
is,
as
i
discussed
earlier,
simply
because
the
third
circuit
misread
the
statute.
this
court
can
resolve
this
matter
on
a
very
narrow
holding.
this
court
can
confirm
that
in
fact,
as
stated
in
lake
country,
when
determining
whether
or
not
an
entity
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
the
state
treasury
factors
are
the
reason
that
some
entities
are
extended
that
protection.
this
court
can
then
find
that
the
third
circuit
simply
misread
the
statute
and
misapplied
that
constitutional
formula.
had
the
third
circuit
included
those
last
three
or
four
words
of
the
statute,
it
would
not
have
found
that
there
was
a
discretion...
or,
i'm
sorry,
it
would
not
have
found
that
there
was
a
compulsive
requirement
on
the
part
of
the
states
to
fund
the
entity.
that
is
the
narrow
ruling
of
this
case,
and
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
why
there
is
that
discrepancy
between
the
third
circuit's
opinions.
mr.
welsh
indicated
the
importance
of
the
consent
to
sue
statute,
and
its
relevance
in
terms
of
the
position
of
the
states
with
respect
to
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
your
honor,
i
don't
expect
that
the
state
of
new
york
is
going
to
let
new
york
city
go
totally
bankrupt,
either,
but
new
york
city
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
likewise,
any
other
state
and
any
other
political
subdivision.
this
court
has
recognized
that
political
subdivisions,
counties,
and
municipalities,
are
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
state
of
new
jersey
do
not--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--justice
scalia,
let
us
actually
look
at
the
port
authority.
first
of
all,
although
admittedly
the
members
of
the
board
of
governors
are
appointed
by
the
governors,
these
are
not
state
officials.
it's
not
as
if
the
state
department
of
transportation
secretary
sits
on
the
board.
the
membere
of
the
board
of
governors
are
primarily
leading
members
of
industry.
like
in
lake
country,
they're
oriented
toward
the
port
district.
two-thirds
of
the
members
of
the
board
of
governors
must
be
voting
members
of
the
port
district.
in
addition
to
whatever--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--subject
to
a
veto,
but
if
we
presume
that
there
are...
we
don't
have
to
presume,
it
is
true.
there
are
today
certain
rules
and
regulations
existing
for
the
port
authority.
there
are
certain
legislative
mandates
for
the
port
authority.
if
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
state
of
new
jersey
cannot
agree
on
another
issue
with
regard
to
the
port
authority
from
now
until
the
end
of
time,
the
port
authority
will
continue
to
operate
on
its
own,
following
the
past
legislative
mandates,
determining
on
its
own
the
rules
and
regulations.
i
direct
the
court's
attention
and
invite
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
compact
provides
that
all
of
the
details
for
the
effectuation,
the
financing,
the
leasing,
the
tolls,
the
rentals,
et
cetera,
are
within
the
sole
discretion
and
are
controlling
conclusive...
i
apologize.
that's
in
a
statute.
the
compact
itself
provides
that
the
port
authority
will
have
all
powers
necessary
and
appropriate
to
effectuate
the
plan
other
than
the
power
to
tax.
that
authority
has
enormous
power
on
its
own,
and
that
power
is
exercised
as
a
large
landlord
in
the
new
york
area.
they
own
the
world
trade
center.
they
own
several
other
complexes.
it's
important
to
remember
that
the
port
authority
district
contains
1,500
square
miles
of
land
centering
in
new
york
harbor.
