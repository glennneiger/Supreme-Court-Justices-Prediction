well,
can
we
talk
about
that
a
little
bit?
the
states
are
liable
up
to
$100,000?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
up
to
the
$100,000?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
other
side
of
the
coin?
if
the
port
authority
and
the
related
entities
make
money,
and
there's
something
left
over,
that
goes
back
to
the
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
tried
to
ask
you
about
whether
the
states
would
receive
any
surplus
revenues,
and
you
never
really
answered
the
question.
you
went
off--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
a
different
direction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
it
is
possible
that
the
states
may
receive
surplus
revenues
under
this
scheme?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
have
there
ever
been
years
in
which
there
were
such
revenues
that
the
states
shared?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
our
multifactor
test
doesn't
work
very
well.
