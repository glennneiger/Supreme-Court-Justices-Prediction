why
does
one
follow
from
the
other?
is
it
necessarily
so
that
if
path
has
immunity...
well,
is
it
necessary
to
sort
of...
if
the
port
authority
has
immunity
that
path
does?
path
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary,
as
it's
described.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
a
state
created
a
corporation
and
gave
it
all
the
immunities
of
the
state,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
follow
that
it
would
have
immunity
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
that
would
still
be
for
us
to
determine.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i'm
not...
so
nothing
turns,
in
your
view,
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
of
the
port
authority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
that's
the
analysis
that
we
have
to
follow
here,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
don't
think
anything
turns
on
that
first
inquiry,
as
i
understand
your
brief.
you
treat
path
just
as
if
it
were
the
port
authority.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
agree
with
that,
counsel?
why
isn't
two
sovereign...
isn't
two
sovereigns
just
half
of
the
control
that
a
state
usually
has?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
so--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that's
almost
always
the
case
with
any
state
agency,
so
why
isn't
your
argument
that,
sui
generis,
this
is
a
category
where
no
state,
no
eleventh
amendment
immunity
can
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
want
us
to
say
that
the
port
authority
is
an
arm
of
the
state
of
new
york?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
it
has
a
more
autonomous
existence
than
that
when
the
state
of
new
york
has
to
go
into
court
to
sue
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
compel
it
to
take
action
that
it
wishes,
that
new
york
wants.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean,
if
the
port
authority
were
trespassing
on
my
property,
as
a
private
property
owner
i
couldn't
obtain
an
injunction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
does
path
have
the
same
protection--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
only
the
attorney
general
can
enjoin
path?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
path
was
created
by
the
compact.
am
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
can
you
tell
me--
--for
instance,
if
a
state
said
that
a
municipality
were
to
have
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
we
would
just
ignore
that.
we
would
look
to
see
what
the
function
was.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
fact
that
the
state
says
it
is
not
controlling.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
guess
the
reason
might
be
the
lack
of
political
control.
each
state
is
controlled
by
its
citizens,
but
a
bi-state
agency
is
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
controlled
only
half
by
each
state,
and
you
are
creating
an
entity,
a
new
governmental
entity
which
is
now
exempt
from
suit.
this
is
a
very
serious
immunity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
this...
are
you
describing
the
port
authority
of
new
york
and
path?
