justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
well,
it
may
work
one
way
and
not
the
other
way.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
port
authority
is
not
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity,
surely
path
is
not,
but
if
the
port
authority
is,
perhaps
path
is
and
perhaps
it
isn't.
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
take
a
similar
internat...
do
you
think
that
is
enough
just
with
those
givens
we
can
say
it's
not
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity,
neither
a
state
nor--
justice
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
nor
can
it
act...
can
a
state
require
its
action.
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
an
international
organization
like
opec,
for
example,
an
international
organization
of
sovereigns
to
operate
in
one
particular
field,
or
what
about
something
like
a
joint
command
of
a
military
operation
like
a
crusade
in
europe,
i
mean,
the
unified
forces?
justice
scalia
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
opec
is
suable
in
american
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
talking
about
sovereign
immunity
in
the
international
sense,
which
has
a
lot
of
bearing
upon
what
sovereign
immunity
in
the
eleventh
amendment
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see,
i've
always
thought
that
an
organization
like
opec
surely
is
not
suable.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
individual
nation
can
control
it.
just
as
in
a
joint
military
operation
no
individual
state
can
control
it.
it
has
to
have
the
consent
of
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you're
wrong,
but--
--mr.
katz,
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
you
are
relying
dominantly
on,
this
is
an
entity
that
raises
its
own
money
and
pays
its
own
way?
i
thought
that
that's
what...
you
were
emphasizing
that
and
not
the
business
of
who
controls,
or
how
is
the
control
spread.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
should
the
fact
that
two
states
are
involved,
or
two
sovereigns
are
involved,
eliminate
sovereign
immunity?
it
seems
to
me
you
have
double
the
claim
to
sovereign
immunity,
if
anything.
i
don't
understand
that
it
follows.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
very
true--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
so
what?
that's
very
true,
but
so
what?
i
mean,
we've
said
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
simply
a
reflection
of
preexisting
notions
of
sovereign
immunity
that
came
along
with
our
union
before
the
eleventh
amendment
was
even
adopted.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
those
standard
conceptions
of
sovereign
immunity
extend
to
two
sovereigns
acting
jointly
just
as
they
extend
to
a
single
sovereign.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true,
but
why
does
that
lead
to
the
conclusion...
that
says
they
cannot
act
jointly
without
the
approval
of
congress,
but
why
does
it
follow
from
that
that
when...
moreover,
which
is
what
you're
saying,
when
they
do
act
jointly,
they
no
longer
have
sovereign
immunity
the
way
they
used
to?
i
don't
see
how
that
follows.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
looks
to
the
treasury
factors
when
there's
any
doubt
whether
you're
suing
the
state.
if
you
sued
a
department
of
the
state
to
get
the
state
to
get
particular
state
action,
is
there
any
doubt
the
eleventh
amendment
would
apply,
unless
there's
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--treasury
or
no
treasury,
you
can't
sue
a
state
agency
as
such.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
one
factor,
but
don't
make
it
the
be-all
and
end-all.
it's
certainly
a
sufficient
factor,
i
think.
i'm
not
sure
it's
anywhere
near
a
necessary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
all
reduces
back
down
to
your
basic
argument
that
you
have
no
sovereign
immunity
unless
you
are
within
the
control
of
a
single
state,
and
that
being
within
the
control
of
two
sovereign
states
suddenly
eliminates
sovereign
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
derivative
of
two
sovereigns.
the
two
sovereigns
are
the
only
people
that
can
exercise
control
over
it
instead
of
one
sovereign.
you
know,
two
sovereigns
are
twice
as
good
as
one
sovereign,
it
seems
to
me,
not
half
as
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
fact
that
they
can
do
it
jointly
by
agreement
with
one
another,
we
have
to
rule
that
out
of
accounting?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
do
you
do?
it's
their
money.
if
new
york
and
new
jersey
agree,
it's
their
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that...
i
mean,
just
saying
it
doesn't
make
it
so.
if
we're
in
agreement,
and
i
think
you
are,
that
whether
sovereign
immunity
on
the
part
of
an
entity
exists
or
not
depends
to
a
large
degree
upon
the
functions
that
that
entity
performs,
simply
creating
a
subordinate
entity
which
may
do
something
that
is
not
essential
to
state
action
and
what-not,
and
that
does
not
bring
any
money
into
the
state
treasury
or
take
any
money
out,
if
you
do
that,
even
though
you
say
it
shall
share
in
all
the
sovereign
immunity
that
i
have,
that
wouldn't
be
effective,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
convince
us
not
only
that
the
port
authority
but
that
path
meets
the
test
that
you've
been
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
you
answered
my
question.
do
you
agree
that
we
have
to
look
to
the
activities
and
the
functions
performed
by
path?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
enjoin
the
officer
acting
on
behalf
of
the
authority--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
as
you
can
enjoin
a
state
officer.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
welsh,
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
that
we've
also
had
cases
subsequent
to
lake
country
which
say
that
the
eleventh
amendment
means
more
than
it
says,
that
it
is
simply
exemplary
of
a
sovereign
immunity
which
was
assumed
to
exist
even
before
the
eleventh
amendment
was
passed,
and
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
simply
addressed
the
most
common
instance
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
all
post
lake
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
for
both
of
them
their
actions
can
be
vetoed
by
the
governor
within
30
days?
justice
antonin
scalia
line-item
veto,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
functions
does
path
perform
here
that
you
would
characterize
as
essentially
governmental
functions?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
they
can
say
it's
so,
but
is
it
so?
i
mean,
most
railroads
are
not
run
by
states.
i
think
it's
rather
unusual
to
have
a
state-run
railroad,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
haven't
held
washington
metro
to
be
immune,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
huh?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we,
us
here,
i
don't
mean...
i
don't
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
never...
i
never
use
the
editorial
mr.
welsh.
i
never
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
katz,
before
you
get
off
that
question,
why
should
it
make
a
difference
whether
there
is
technically
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
a
now-bankrupt
port
authority,
or
path?
i
mean,
if,
in
fact,
the
alternative
is
that
the
whole
port...
you
don't
really
think
new
york
and
new
jersey
are
going
to
let
the
port
authority
cease
to
function.
justice
antonin
scalia
not...
there
are
good
reasons
why
new
york
would
not
be
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity,
but
i
question
whether
the
good
reason
is
just
simply
the
state
of
new
york
does
not
bear
the
expenses
of
the
city
of
new
york.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
in
all
other
respects
the
unit
in
question
is
at
a
state
level,
is
performing
state
functions,
is
governed
by
state
officers,
i
don't
know
that
it
makes
a
whole
lot
of
difference
whether
technically
the
funds
come
directly
out
of
the
treasury
or
the
functions
are
so
important
to
the
state
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
the
entity
is
bankrupt
the
state
is
going
to
have
to
reach
into
its
pocket
to
support
it.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
a
factor
of
that
overwhelming
significance.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
subject
to
a
veto
in
10
days
of
anything
that
they
do,
which,
of
course,
you
know
the
councilmen
from
new
york
are
not.
