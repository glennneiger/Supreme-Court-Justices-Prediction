but
in
any
case,
the
terms
of
the
corporate
charter
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
inquiry
except
insofar
as
it
identifies
the
powers
of
the
corporation
and
allows
us
to
determine
whether
the
corporation
is
equivalent
to
the
authority,
and
hence
whether
the
authority
is
equivalent
to
the
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
it
is
the
same,
it's
not
because
its
charter
says
it's
the
same,
it's
because
under
straight
eleventh
amendment
analysis
it
is
the
same.
nothing
is
added
by
their
saying,
this
is
the
same,
any
more
than
anything
is
added
to
the
analysis
by
the
port
authority's
enabling
act
saying
this
is
the
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
intent
got
to
do...
as
i
understand
it,
what
justice
stevens
has
suggested
is
not
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
it
would
be
the
equivalent
of
statutory
immunity
created
for
this
entity
by
congress
on
the
theory
that
the
compact
is
treated
as
federal
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
ask
you...
and
i
suppose
this
is
just
a
theoretical
question,
but
let's
assume
that
in
this
case
we
were
to
find
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
compacting
parties,
approved
by
congress,
to
extend
immunity
to
path.
would
you
lose,
in
that
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
we
took
a
case,
as
i
understand
it,
to
decide
what
the
eleventh
amendment
provides,
and
i
think
you
have
agreed
with
me
that
whatever
this
immunity
might
be
based
on
intent
with
congressional
approval,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
why
does
anybody
bother
with
the
attorney
general,
then?
