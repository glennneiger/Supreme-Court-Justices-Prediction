chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
93-1197,
albert
hess
and
charles
f.
walsh
v.
the
port
authority
trans-hudson
corporation.
mr.
katz.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
as
a
matter
of
law
if
there's
a
bi-state
entity
it
does
not
have
eleventh
amendment
immunity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
apply
no
different
test
to
a
bi-state
entity
than
to
a
single
state
entity,
then.
is
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
in
the
lake
country
estates
there's
certainly
no
suggestion,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
that
the
analysis
is
different
because
it's
a
bi-state
entity
rather
than
a
single-state
entity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you're
saying
as
a
matter
of
law
a
bi-state
entity
cannot
have
eleventh
amendment
protection.
you
don't
need
to
examine
all
these
other
factors,
because
in
no
bi-state
entity
will
you
find
that
one
state
can
act
on
its
own.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you've
agreed
with
several
totally
inconsistent
propositions,
it
seems
to
me.
first,
no
bi-state
entity
can
have
eleventh
amendment...
second,
that
it
depends
on
the
facts
and
circumstances.
what
is
your
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
just
tell
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
katz.
mr.
welsh,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
not
saying
that
one
may
sue
the
port
authority
only
by
going
to
the
attorney
general
and
having
him
bring
the
suit
in
your
stead,
are
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
suit
for
damages
is
otherwise.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
a
fixed
term
of
years
at
the
pleasure
of
the
governor,
or
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
new
york
unilaterally
can
remove
new
york
appointees?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
the
resolutions
deal
with,
proposed
future
projects?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
a
resolution
dealing
with
personnel
matters--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
welsh.
mr.
katz,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
katz.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
93-1197,
hess
v.
port
authority
trans-hudson
corporation
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
