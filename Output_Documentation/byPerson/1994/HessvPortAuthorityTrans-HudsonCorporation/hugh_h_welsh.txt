mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
more
than
30
years,
the
port
authority
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
shared
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
two
states
that
created
it,
and
it
was
not
until
1951
that
the
two
states
passed
legislation
that
permitted
suits
against
the
port
authority
in
the
first
place.
this
court
has
found
that
that
conditional
waiver
of
the
sovereign
immunity
also
contained
language
that
constituted
a
conditional
waiver
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
so
when
this
case
was
filed
beyond
the
1
year
within
which
such
suits
may
be
bought,
it
was
only
logical,
then,
for
the
district
of
new
jersey
and
later
the
third
circuit
to
dismiss
the
case
because
of
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court,
because
the
eleventh
amendment
would
bar
this
action
being
bought
against
an
arm
of
the
state
in
the
federal
courts.
the
court
over
the
years
has
considered
many
factors
to
determine
whether
a
state
agency
is
in
fact
an
arm
of
the
state
entitled
to
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
one
takes
a
look
at
the
port
authority
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
and
its
subsidiary,
path,
it's
quite
clear
that
it
does
share
the
indicia,
or
the
criteria,
that
the
court
has
applied
in
a
number
of
cases.
if
you
take
all
of
the
indicia,
all
of
the
criteria
that
have
been
considered
over
the
years,
you'll
find
that
they
really
come
down
to
two
fundamental
questions,
and
one
is,
did
the
states
create
an
agency
that
was
an
arm
of
the
state
and
entitled
to
share
in
the
immunity,
and
secondly,
did
they
continue
to
exercise
control
over
that
agency
and,
in
both
cases,
that
is
the
case
of
the
port
authority.
so
if
we
apply
the
indicia
from
lake
country
estates
or
from
the
mount
healthy
decision,
both
decisions
of
this
court,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
the
port
authority
does
share
that
immunity.
a
number
of
questions
were
asked
relating
to
the
state
treasury
test.
justice
o'connor
asked
about
the
limit
of
$100,000
on
the
state's
obligation
to
the
port
authority.
i
believe
what
we
were
referring
to
there
was
an
obligation
at
the
time
the
port
authority
was
created
for
each
state
to
commit
up
to
$100,000
each
until
such
time
as
the
port
authority
became
self-supporting.
there
were
other
times
in
its
history
that
the
port
authority
was
supported
by
the
states
of
new
york
and
new
jersey.
in
its
early
days
when
there
was
a
danger
of
defaulting
on
the
bonds,
the
two
states
actually
gave
to
the
port
authority
the
operation
and
control
over
the
holland
tunnel,
and
the
revenues
from
that
facility,
which
was
built
by
the
two
states,
helped
to
support
the
port
authority,
and
then,
since
then,
the
port
authority
has
been
self-supporting.
the
treasury
argument,
or
the
treasury
criteria,
certainly
is
not
the
only
criteria
that
the
court
has
looked
at
over
the
years,
but
even
if
one
focuses
on
that
with
regard
to
the
port
authority,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
port
authority
is
very
closely
linked
to
the
treasuries
of
both
of
the
states
that
created
it.
it's
true
that
the
port
authority
may
not
pledge
the
credit
of
either
the
state
of
new
york
or
new
jersey.
it's
also
true
that
a
judgment
against
path
or
the
port
authority
will
not
be
paid
for
directly
out
of
the
state
treasury
of
either
state.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
yes.
there's
a
series
of
cases
that
came
down
during
that
period
of
time
that
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
port
authority
shared
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
two
states
until
1951.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
there
was
no
remedy.
normally
those
issues,
those
cases
were
dealt
with
through
resolutions
that
were
passed,
much
like
many
states
used
to
deal
with
claims
against--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--by
the
board
of
commissioners
of
the
port
authority
resolving
the
cases
and
providing
for
payment.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
and
it's
my
understanding
that
a
number
of
cases
before
they
waived...
a
number
of
states
before
they
waived
sovereign
immunity
would
deal
with
claims
in
a
similar
manner,
until
they
created
court
of
claims
or
decided
to
waive
it
through
some
tort
claims
act.
but
if
one
looks
at
the
port
authority
and
the
history
of
the
relationship
between
the
two...
the
port
authority
and
the
two
states
that
created
it,
it's
quite
evident
that
there
is
a
very
close
link
financially
between
the
states
and
the
port
authority.
the
port
authority
is
somewhat
unique
for
state
agencies,
because
the
port
authority
is
essentially
lending
its
support
to
the
states
that
created
it,
so
any
judgment
against
the
port
authority
is
an
impact
on
the
state
fisc.
if
one
considers
the
state
treasuries
of
the
other
two
states
to
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
people,
and
in
fact
the
treasury
of
the
port
authority
to
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
people,
this--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--in
bolden
and
other
third
circuit
cases,
the
third
circuit
did
focus
on
the
fact
that
the
treasury
factor
was
an
important
factor,
but
it
made
it
quite
clear
it
was
not
the
only
factor,
and
they
applied
a
balance
of
those
factors.
interestingly
in
bolden--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--that
was
part
of
the
distinction
that
was
made
in
bolden
to,
i
think
it
was
the
southeast
pennsylvania
transit
authority
in
the
bolden
case,
that
they
focused
on
the
fact
that
the
states
might
step
in
in
the
case
of
the
port
authority,
but
i
suggest
that
they
also
looked
at
other
factors
in
bolden.
in
bolden,
the
third
circuit,
sitting
en
banc,
considered
a
continuum
with
the
port
authority
at
one
end
as
an
example
of
an
agency
that
was
entitled
to
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
i
think
at
rutgers
university
at
the
other
end,
and
they
were
trying
to
determine
where
on
that
continuum
spta
fit
in,
but
they
didn't
rely
solely
on
the
treasury...
argument
of
the
treasury
issue
to
determine
that
case.
the
port
authority
over
the
years
has
committed
vast
resources
to
the
support
of
the
two
states
that
created
it.
this
was
done
through
bi-state
legislation
that
was
passed
by
the
two
states
authorizing
and
directing
the
port
authority
to
undertake
various
projects,
and
we
set
forth
a
number
of
examples
in
our
brief
with
citations
to
the
authorizing
legislation.
as
an
example,
the
port
authority
has
committed
$440
million,
$220
million
to
each
state,
to
acquire
buses
that
are
being
used
by
the
two
states
for
the
benefit
of
their
people.
we
have
provided
railroad
connections
when
requested
by
the
state,
and
we've
committed
$106
million
pursuant
to
legislation
to
develop
the
so-called
oak
point
connection,
and
this
was
done
at
the
request
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
there
are
a
number
of
other
projects
that
the
states
have
come
to
the
port
authority
to
ask
for
the
port
authority...
in
effect
direct
the
port
authority
and
authorize
the
port
authority
to
support
the
state
in
its
endeavors,
so
there
is
a
very
close
financial
link
between
the
port
authority
and
the
two
states.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
yes,
i
believe
it
is
an
arm
of
the
state,
of
both
new
york
and
new
jersey.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
yes,
justice--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--justice
kennedy,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
such
as
that
where
the
state
attorney
general
has
lent
his
office
and
his
name
to
injunctive
actions
that
would
award
against
the
port
authority,
and
that
was
one
of
them.
we
suggested
in
our
brief,
and
i
believe
it
is
a
valid
suggestion,
that
that
in
fact
is
an
argument
in
support
of
the
fact
that
the
port
authority
is
an
arm
or
an
agency
of
the
state.
the
two
state
legislatures
have
stated
that
one
may
not
get
an
injunction
against
the
port
authority
unless
the
action
is
bought
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state,
thereby
limiting
the
actions
that
can
be
bought
against
the
agency.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
in
a
case
entitled
evans-aristocrat
industries
v.
the
port
authority,
made
it
clear
what
the
purpose
of
that
provision
was
in
the
statute,
and
they
stated
that
the
purpose
was
to
permit
a
state
governmental
authority,
in
this
case
an
attorney
general,
to
screen
the
actions
that
are
being
bought
against
the
port
authority
to
assure
that
strike
suits
or
similar
actions
would
not
be
bought
that
would
delay
or
prevent
the
undertaking
of
valid,
much-needed
public
projects
by
the
port
authority.
so
at
least
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
viewed
that
provision
that
requires
the
attorney
general
in
all
cases
to
seek
an
injunction--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--the
cases
have
held
that
a
suit
for
an
injunction
against
the
port
authority
may
only
be
bought
by
the
attorney
general
of
one
of
the
states.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
a
suit
for
damages
is
otherwise.
that
limitation
relates
only
to
suits
for
injunctive
relief.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
no.
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
attorney
general
to
seek
an
injunction.
the
attorney
general
would
have
to
file
that
suit
on
your
behalf
or
endorse
the
action
that
was
being
bought.
you
could,
of
course,
bring
a
suit
for
money
damages
as
a
taking
in
that
particular
case.
you
wouldn't
be
barred
because
of
that
provision
of
what
we
call
the
suability--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--yes,
it
does.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
yes,
it
does.
the
statute
that
created
path,
the
bi-state
legislation
that
created
path
and
authorized
the
port
authority
to
establish
a
railroad,
states
quite
clearly
that
the
subsidiary
corporation
will
share
in
all
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
port
authority
as
if
it
was--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--no.
path
was
created
by
bi-state
legislation
between
the
two
states.
path
was
not
created
until
1961.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
well,
the--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--the...
i
believe
that
if
we
find
that
the
port
authority
shares
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
of
the
states,
and
it
was
created
as
such
an
agency...
not
necessarily
with
the
intent,
but
because
of
its
fundamental
nature
is
an
arm
of
the
state,
i
believe
it
does
follow
that
that
subsidiary
corporation,
because
it
is
established
under
the
authority
from
the
two
states,
would
share
in
the
immunity.
but
the
legislation
does
state
that
path,
the
subsidiary,
in
undertaking
the
development
of
the
railroad,
is
doing
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
of
the
two
states,
for
their
prosperity,
and
has
a
great
deal
of
language
in
the
bi-state
legislation--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--i
think
the
functions
are
one
of
the
criteria
that
has
to
be
looked
for.
that's
certainly
a
valid
inquiry.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
exactly.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
well,
the
state's
announcement
is
certainly
strong
evidence
of
the
nature
of
the
agency,
but
that
alone
does
not,
of
course,
grant
a
state
agency
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
it's
the
nature
of
the
agency
itself.
the
states
do
not
bestow
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
nor
does
congress
bestow
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
to
be
perfectly
honest,
justice
ginsburg,
i
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
understanding
the
fitchik
case
involving
new
jersey
transit.
i
think
the
third
circuit
was
somewhat
inconsistent
there.
very
frankly,
i
think
new
jersey
transit
should
share
in
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
also.
i
have
difficulty.
i
can
distinguish
path,
however,
from
both
of
those
enterprises.
there
are
very,
very
strong
controls
over
the
port
authority
that
i
am
not
sure
exists
with
regard
to
those
other
agencies
in
it...
beyond
the
state
treasury
argument.
an
example
is
the
commissioners
of
the
port
authority
themselves,
the
governing
body,
are
appointed
by
the
governors
of
the
two
states,
and
the
governors
maintain--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--i'm
not
sure
how
they
were
appointed.
i
think
that
new
jersey
transit
may
be
an
appointed
board,
also.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
element
of
control.
in
the
case
of
the
port
authority,
the
governor
can
exercise
veto
power
over
the
activities
of
the
commissioners,
and
has
a
right
within
10
working
days
to
veto
any
action
that's
taken.
i'm
not
sure
that
exists
in
the
case
of
new
jersey
transit.
but
beyond
that,
of
course,
the
port
authority
and
path
operate
in
a
far
wider
field.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
yes,
i
do.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
unless
we
can
find--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--no
case
on
point,
other
than
cases
that
involved
other
statutes.
unless
one
can
point
to
a
piece
of
federal
legislation
where
there
has
been
an
explicit
abrogation
of
eleventh
amendment,
for
some
reason--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--yes,
you
can.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
you
can
enjoin
the
state
officer
prospectively,
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
involving
grants-in-aid
and
the
like,
or
a
violation
of
civil
rights,
where
you
can
seek
an
injunction
against
the
officer
barring
their
prospective
action.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
you're
talking
about
federal
actions.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
you
may
not
bring
the
action
for
past
damages.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
well,
there's
a--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--i
suggest
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
available
against
a
state
officer
as
opposed
to
the
agency
itself.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
in
the
state
court,
an
action
in
lieu
of
prerogative
writ,
or
in
the
state
of
new
york,
an
article
78
action
would
be
available
against
the
officer
even
though
it
would
not
be
permitted
against
the
state
agency
itself.
the
distinction
is
made
between
action
of
the
officer,
and
in
many
cases
it
might
be
considered
to
be
ultra
vires.
so
that
remedy
is
available.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
frankly,
i
don't
know.
they
would
have
to
establish
the
fact
that
the
officer
was
acting
ultra
vires
and
beyond
his
authority,
or
some
other
standard
that
would
apply
to
an
action
in
lieu
of
prerogative
writ.
normally,
they
attack
the
policy
of
the
port
authority
in
such
actions,
rather
than
the
activity
of
a
state
officer,
we
find.
from
experience
i've
seen
that.
but
there
is
a
remedy
available,
i
suggest,
and
in
a
number
of
occasions
in
new
york
people
have
sought
such
a
remedy
through--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--well,
if
one
remembers
that
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is
a
constitutional
provision
that
protects
the
states...
state
or
states,
there's
no
reason
to
distinguish
between
the
immunity
that
a
state
has,
acting
as
one
state,
or
if
that
one
state
chooses--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--well,
in
lake
country
the
court
looked
at
the
compact
itself,
and
it
found
language
in
the
compact
itself
that
it
felt
was
a
clear
indication
that
it
was...
the
states
did
not
intend
for
this
new
agency
that
was
created
to
have
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
then
it
went
on,
i
believe...
i
think...
i
believe
it's
page
401
of
the
lake
country
estates.
there's
a
two-sentence
paragraph,
and
it
refers
to
the
fact
that
a
review
of
the
compact
does
not
find
evidence
for
the
support
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
states
to
create
such
an
entity,
and
then
goes
on
to
say,
in
the
absence
of
such
a
finding,
but
it
was
referring
to
that
specific
compact
when
it
referred
to--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--yes.
it
was
nothing
in
that
particular
compact,
but
it
was
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
was
strong
language
in
there--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--i
believe
the
general
rule
should
be
that
in
the
absence
of
language,
one
should
assume
that
the
eleventh
amendment
does
protect
the
agency
if
it
is
an
agency
of
a
nature
that
would
make
it
an
arm
of
the
state
for
those
purposes.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
yes.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
there
have
been
cases--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--and
one
of
the
recent
cases--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--was
puerto
rico
aqueduct,
but
one
has
to
remember
that
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is
not
bestowed
by
the
states,
nor
is
it
bestowed
by
congress.
it's
bestowed
by
the
constitution
onto
the
states,
and
if
the
states...
if
one
state
would
have
that
eleventh
amendment
immunity
and
would
have
the
right,
under
the
constitution,
to
create
an
agency
as
its
arm
that
also
shares
in
that
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
i
see
no
reason
why
two
states
can
combined,
each
exercising
its
own
sovereign
rights
to
create
a
bi-state
agency,
and
that
agency
also
share
in
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--in--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--the
petitioner
suggests
that
the
port
authority
is
not
either
legally
or
politically
controlled
by
the
two
states.
that
simply
isn't
the
fact.
the
port
authority
may
not
act
unless
it
has
legislative
authority
from
the
two
states
that
created
it.
it
requires
bi-state
approval
for
the
various
projects.
a
good
example
of
that
was
the
construction
of
the
third
tube
of
the
lincoln
tunnel.
interestingly,
it
was
justice
brennan,
then
sitting
as
a
justice
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
that
ruled
that
the
port
authority
lacked
the
authority
to
undertake
the
construction
in
that
tube,
absent
specific
authority
coming
from
the
two
state
legislatures.
so
there
is
legal
control
over
the
agency.
there's
also
the
veto
power
that
the
governor,
an
elected
official,
exercises
over
the
acts
of
the
board
of
commissioners
of
the
power
authority.
those
commissioners
are
appointed
by
the
chief
executive
officer
of
each
state,
and
their
appointment
is
subject
to
the
approval
process
of
each
of
the
states,
in
both
cases
through
the
senate
of
each
of
the
state--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--they
serve
for
a
6-year
term,
but
they
can
be
removed
for
cause
either
by
the
governor
of
one
state
after
a
hearing,
or
the
state
senate
in
new
jersey
can
remove
them,
but
there
is
a
fixed
term.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
yes.
each
state
reserved
the
right
to
enact
legislation
relating
to
the
appointment
of
their
commissioners.
in
the
case
of
new
york,
they
have
provided
for
the
removal
by
the
governor
after...
it's
a
for-cause
removal,
but
the
governor
exercises
that
right.
in
new
jersey,
the
right
is
exercised
by
the
state
senate.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
no,
10
days.
the
board
of
commissioners
of
the
port
authority
acts,
like
most
boards,
through
resolutions.
their
actions
in
passing
resolutions
approving
the
activities
of
the
port
authority
is
subject
to
the
veto
of
the
governors
of
the
states,
so
they
can
actually
veto
the
minutes
of
the
meeting,
veto
these
resolutions
and--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--it's
a
very
precise
veto.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--it
is.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
it
is
a
line-item
veto.
it
deals
with
a
specific
resolution
that
would
be
passed
by
the
board
authorizing
the
staff
to
do
things.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
the
resolutions,
mr.
chief
justice,
can
deal
with
any
of
the
activities
of
the
port
authority.
they
could
range
to
the
port
authority
undertaking
the
planning
for
a...
you
know,
a
new
airport,
an
airport
connection,
down
to
a
resolution
adopting
the
budget
of
the
agency,
resolution
authorizing
the
award
of
certain
contracts...
they
are
all
subject
to
a
veto
power.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
the
personnel
matters
are
usually
found
in
a
budget
resolution.
the
specific
hiring
and
firing
is
left
to
the
executive
director,
but
policies
that
are
found
in
board
resolutions
would
be
subject
to
the
veto,
pay
raises
as
contained
in
the
budget
resolution
of
course
would
be
subject
to--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--yes.
the
minutes
of
path
are
also
subject
to
gubernatorial
veto.
the
board
of
commissioners
of
the
port
authority
are
in
fact
the
board
of
directors
of
path,
by
the
legislation
that
created
path
and
the
by-laws
of
path.
the
board
of
commissioners
also
function
as
the
board
of
directors.
they
are
the
exact
same
people,
and
their
actions
are
also
subject
to
gubernatorial
veto.
so
there
is
a
great
deal
of
legal
control
over
the
activities
of
the
agency.
in
addition,
of
course,
there's
more
subtle
control
in
the
form
of
political
control.
the
board,
the
port
authority
consists
of
12
commissioners
who
are
the
appointees
of
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
two
states.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
well
now,
i
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
third
circuit
established
a
continuum
in
doing
an
analysis.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
if
you're
referring
to
the
recent...
well--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--yes.
well,
that
was
a
case
decided
in
the
first
circuit,
and--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--and
in
the
puerto
rican
port
authority
case
they
looked
at
the
functions
of
the
agency,
among
other
things.
they
considered
the
state
treasury
issue,
but
in
addition
they...
there
was
an
analysis
that
included
a
proprietary
governmental
function
analysis,
and
they
viewed
the
puerto
rican
port
authority
as
an
agency
that
was
more
akin
to
a
private
corporation
because
it
leased
port
facilities
and
it
paid
as
it
went,
and
there
wasn't
a
great
deal
of
discussion
as
to
the
political
or
the
legal
controls
over
the
agency,
other
than
the
general
functions
of
the
agency.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
well,
one...
first
of
all,
it's
the
operation
of
a
mass
transit
system
that
the
two
states
have
specifically
found
to
be
a
governmental
undertaking.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
actually,
one
fine
example
of
that
is
right
here
in
the
washington
metropolitan
area
in
washington
metro,
where
the
washington
metro
has
been
held
to
share
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
of
the
states
of
virginia
and
maryland.
i
believe
that
the
operation
of
mass
transit
systems
has
come
to
be
a
governmental
function.
if
one
looks
around
the
country,
you'll
find
that
most
public
transit
systems
today
are
being
operated
by
agencies
of
either
municipalities
or
state
government.
we
could
go
around
the
country
and
look
at
them,
ranging
from
san
francisco
all
the
way
to
the
east,
but
a
good
example
is
right
here
in
this
city
with
washington
metro.
in
the
case
of
path,
the
enabling
legislation
that
authorized
the
port
authority--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--yes,
you
did.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
yes.
in
a
decision
by
judge
bork
that
i
believe
your
honor
concurred
in.
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
not
this
one.
[laughter]
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
no,
this
court
has
not.
it
hasn't
reached
this
court,
but
the--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--wmata
was...
focused
on
the
control
that
was
being
exercised
by
the
creating
states
over
that
agency
that
was
created
to
operate
the
transit
system.
treasury
was
one
of
the
issues,
and
i
believe
wmata
is
dependant
on
both
the
federal
government
and
the
states
for
a
certain
amount
of
support,
but
in
addition,
there
was
a
focus
on
the
fact
that
the
two
states
did
exercise
control
over
that
agency,
so--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--well,
it
was
acknowledged
there
that
the
judgment
would
be
paid
by
wmata,
but
ultimately
it
might
be
borne
by
the
riders
or
be
borne
by
the
two
states
that
are
subsidizing
it.
that
was
provided
in
wmata,
but
my
point
is
that
they
didn't
focus
solely
on
the
state
treasury
test
in
wmata.
this
is
one
of
the
difficulties
that
the
courts
around
the
country
and
the
circuits
courts
are
faced
with,
and
it's
the
fact
that
we
could
have
a
railroad
in
one
state
that
seemingly
has
the
characteristics
of
a
railroad
in
the
other
state,
and
one
circuit
will
hold
that
there
is
immunity
and
the
other
state
will
not.
the
puerto
rican
port
authority
was
held
not
to
have
immunity,
and
yet
in
the
fourth
circuit,
the
south
carolina
port
authority
was
held
to
have
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
the
focus
has
been--
mr.
hugh
h.
welsh
--the
multifactor
test
is
usually
applied
in
a
determination
that
the
agency
does
not
have
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
yet
there
hasn't
been
clear
direction
given
to
the
courts
and
to
public
agencies
as
to
what
should
be
included
to
make
sure
that
there
is
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
or
what
we
should
look
for
to
determine
that
an
agency
is
entitled
to
it.
it's
usually
put
in
a
negative
form
in
the
findings,
such
as
lake
country
estates
and
mount
healthy.
but
all
of
those
indicia
really
come
down
to
two
fundamental
issues,
and
one
is
the
nature
of
the
agency
that
was
created,
and
secondly
is
the
elements
of
control
that
continue
to
be
exercised
by
the
states,
and
i
suggest
to
you
in
both
cases
the
port
authority
and
its
subsidiary,
path,
should
share
in
that
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
the
control
is
there,
there
is
very
strong
political
control,
there's
a
very
strong
legal
control
that's
been
written
in
by
the
two
states
that
have
created
those
agencies.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
