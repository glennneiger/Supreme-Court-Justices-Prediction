justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
reason...
i
thought
you
had
just
said
your
main
argument
doesn't
have
to
do
with
who
controls,
or
it's
bi-state,
but
it
has
to
do
with
how
this
organiz...
what
it's
operation
is,
how
it
pays
for
that
operation.
that
would
be
the
same
if
it
were
one
state
or
two
states,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
the
treasury
factor
isn't
important
at
all.
even
if
this
is
the
biggest
moneymaker
for
the
state,
it
wouldn't
matter,
as
long
as
the
states
intended
it
to
be
immune?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
make
a
distinction
between
an
entity
that
enriches
the
state
by
making...
or
makes
its
own
money,
so
it
doesn't
deplete
this
treasury.
that's
your
big
treasury
factory.
it
doesn't
deplete
the
treasury.
it
may
enrich
the
treasury,
but
should
that...
those
be
equal?
1)
it
doesn't
deplete
the
treasury,
2)
it
enriches
the
treasury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
it
did,
would
that
account
against
your
argument?
this
large
treasury
factor...
i
understand
the
part
they
don't
deplete
the
treasury.
if
it
swells
the
treasury,
does
that
indicate
it's
a
state
agency?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
would
that
be
different
from
the
bolden
and
the
later
cases
involving
pennsylvania,
just
a
one-state
authority?
it
seems
that
those
later
third
circuit
cases
accept
that
the
treasury
factor
is
prime.
that
is,
is
this
entity
making
its
own
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
did
say,
did
they
not,
that
it
was
probably
the
most
important
factor,
and
they
distinguished
the
third
circuit...
whose
decision
is
before
us
for
review...
distinguished
the
port
authority
cases
on
the
ground
that
the
states
really
would
come
to
the
rescue
of
the
port
authority,
that
the
state's
credit
really
did
stand
behind
that
entity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
welsh,
if
it's
the
function
that
counts
now,
how
does
this
path
differ
from
the
pennsylvania...
the
southeastern
pennsylvania,
the
new
jersey
transit,
and
why...
explain
to
me
rationally
why
path
would
get
immunity
that
southeastern
pennsylvania
transit
authority
didn't
have
in
the
third
circuit's
view
and
the
new
jersey
transit
rail
operators
didn't
have.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
the
other
cases
they
were
appointed
by--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
welsh,
you
were
candid
enough
to
say
that
you
have
a
little
problem
with
bolden
and
fitchik,
and
i
think
it
might
be
helpful...
you
say
the
third
circuit
seems
to
be
going
in
the
opposite
direction
in
those
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
did
say
without
qualification
that
who
pays
the
judgments
is
the
most
important
factor.
bolden
i
think
said
that
fairly
flat-out,
didn't
it,
and
there's
another...
what
do
you
make
of
the
puerto
rican
port
authority
case
saying
you
have
to
look
at
the
function
that's
being
performed...
running
a
railroad,
operating
a
dock?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
referring
to
royal
caribbean
against--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
by
a
well-respected
jurist.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
urging
that
that
wmata
case
is
distinguishable,
that
it
wouldn't
be
consistent
to
hold
wmata...
why
don't
you
just
tell
us
what
was
the
reason
for
the
holding
of
immunity
in
wmata?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
who
pays?
