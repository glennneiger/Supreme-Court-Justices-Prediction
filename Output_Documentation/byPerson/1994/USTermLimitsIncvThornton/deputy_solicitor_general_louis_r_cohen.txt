mr.
louis
r.
cohen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
my
theory
of
the
constitution,
which
i
think
is
also
madison's
and
hamilton's
theory
of
the
constitution
on
this
point,
is
that
the
constitution
deals
comprehensively
with
the
filling
of
the
office
of
the
congress
that
it
created,
that
it
prescribes
fixed
qualifications
that
may
not
be
supplemented
by
either
congress
or
the
states,
and
that
it
gives
both
the
states
and
congress
the
power
to
set
time,
place,
and
manner
regulations
so
as
to
assure
fair
and
orderly
elections,
but
that
that
is
an
essentially
procedural
power,
leaving
the
people
at
each
election
to
choose
whom
they
please
to
govern
them.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
of
course--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
agree
that
the
constitutional--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
agree
that
the
constitutional
text
doesn't
resolve
the
issue
because
it
phrases
it
that
way.
one
reason
why
it
may
phrase
it
that
way
is
because
there
are
other
disqualifications
in
the
constitution
itself,
and
there
was
contemplation,
of
course,
of
further
possible
disqualifications,
but
when
madison
and
hamilton
came
to
explain
what
the
constitution
did,
when
the
house
committee
on
elections
in
1807
studied
the
meaning
of
that
clause,
they
concluded
that
the
intention
was
to
make
those
qualifications
exclusive.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
full
house
didn't
adopt
the
report,
but
i
think
it
did
accept
the
house
committee's
view.
it
voted
to
seat
congressman
mccreary,
and
it
voted
to
seat
congressman
mccreary
after
a
point
in
the
debate
when
it
becomes
clear
that
the
dissenter,
mr.
randolph
of
virginia,
recognized
that
he
was
about
to
lose,
and
diverted
the
house
debate
to
a
more
neutral
resolution.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
we
don't
know--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--of
course,
why
anyone
voted.
we
do
know
that
the
understanding
at
the
time,
the
scholarly
understanding
of
what
had
been
resolved
in
the
mccreary
episode
was
that
the--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no,
of
course
not.
of
course
not
this
court
reviewed
this
history
in
the
powell
case
starting
with
the
fact
that
on
august
10,
1787,
the
question
that
was
being
voted
on
on
the
floor
of
the
convention
was
whether
to
give
congress
the
power
to
add
a
property
qualification
or
to
add
other
qualifications.
this
court
said
on
that
day
the
court
faced
and
rejected
the
possibility
that
the
legislature...
and
it
was
clearly
talking
about
legislation,
and
not
merely
about
a
judging
power...
the
legislature
would
have
the
power
to
usurp
the
right
of
the
people
to
return
whom
they
thought
proper.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
i'm...
i'm
leading
up
to
it.
the
court
then
went
on--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--okay.
[laughter]
i
will...
let
me
move
on.
but
the
court
reviewed
hamilton's
statement
in
the
federalist
number
60
that
the
qualifications
were
unalterable
by
the
legislature,
madison's
statement
to
the
same
effect
in
number
52,
where
he
is
clearly
talking
about
state
power
to
add
qualifications.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
i
think
hamilton,
when
he
referred
to
the
legislature,
was
referring
to
congress,
but
i
think
madison
is
talking
about
the
states.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no.
what
he
was
doing
in
52
was
explaining
how
the
constitution
had
fixed
both
the
qualifications
for
voters
and
the
qualifications
for
the
elected.
it
fixed
the
qualifications
for
voters
by
delegating
that
to
the
states
subject
to
the
most
numerous
branch
compromise
requirement.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
madison
uses
the
word
52--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--in
relation
to...
in
relation
to
the
state
constitutional
provisions
on
this
point,
and
he
says
that...
in
effect
that
these
are
fixed
because
the
states
and
the
people
of
the
states
won't
allow
changes
in
state
provisions
for
voting
for
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
state
legislature,
so
we've
dealt
with
that
problem.
i
would
like
to
move
on
to
the
state's
principal
contention,
which
is,
we
didn't
do
that.
we
just
barred
these
people
whom--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--we'd
like
to
disqualify--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
that
powell
is
a
very
persuasive
opinion,
and
the
court
should
find
it
persuasive.
i
also
think
there
is
substantial
additional
evidence
on
our
side
of
this
point
that
wasn't
reviewed
or
reached
in
powell.
i
think--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--it
seems
to
me--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--the...
it
seems
to
me
that
powell
rests
on
the
proposition
that
the
qualifications
were
fixed
in
the
constitution
and
could
not
be
supplemented
legislatively.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
but
as
this
court
explained
in
the
judge
nixon
case,
the
basis
for
that
holding
was
not
an
aspect
of
the
judging
power
as
such,
it
was
the
fact
that
the...
or
that
article
i,
section
2,
fixed
qualifications
that
could
be
applied.
there
are
two
questions
here.
one
is,
vis-a-vis
congress,
are
we
talking
only
about
a
judging
power,
or
are
we
also
talking
about
the
power
to
legislate
additional
qualifications?
it
seems
to
me
every
point
in
argument
that
was
made
in
powell
goes
to
the
power
to
legislate,
not
to
the
power
to
judge,
although
the
ultimate
question
was
only
whether
congress
could
judge.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
ultimate
holding,
i
agree,
but
the
logical
foundation
was
that,
and
it
then
seems
to
me
that
the
extension
to
the
states
is
straightforward.
in
the
first
place,
some
of
the
examples
that
the
court
used
in
powell
were
state
additions
of
qualifications,
or
attempts
by
states
to
add
qualifications.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
agree
that
i
need
to
go
on
to
talk
about
those
points.
i
don't
think
that
the
tenth
amendment
reserves--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no,
no,
no.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no.
i'm
only
saying
that
i
think
powell
did
dispose
of
additional
qualifications.
i
don't
think
the...
and
i
think
that
if
you
read
the
admittedly
not
clear
and
dispositive
constitutional
text
as
a
preclusive
list,
there's
simply
no
logical
reason
to
think
that
it
is
preclusive
vis-a-vis
congress
and
not
preclusive
vis-a-vis
the
states.
but
i
think
this
is
not
a
tenth
amendment
case,
because
the
constitution
doesn't
leave
the
states
or
congress
the
power
to
bar
or
to
officially
and
materially
prefer
some
qualified
candidates
over
others.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
that's
right.
storer--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no.
the
fact
that
storer
said
that
the
states
have
power
to
regulate
access
to
the
ballot
in
order
to
provide
for
fair
and
orderly
elections,
or
as
in
that
case,
in
order
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
various
routes
to
the
ballot
so
as
to
give
people
a
choice,
doesn't
mean
that
the
states
may
impose
ballot
access
limitations
based
on
place
of
birth
or
civil
profession
or
prior
service
in
the
state
legislature
or
prior
service
in
congress,
or
being
under
the
age
of
70.
the
constitution--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--yes.
i
think
the--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
do
not
think
that
either
the
states
or
congress
may
add
qualifications.
i'm
happy
to
use
the
term
qualification
in
the
sense
in
which
you
suggested
earlier,
justice
scalia,
which
is
qualifications
is
something
that--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--that
says
you
can't
serve
if
you
don't
have
it.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
that
is
not
the
case
here,
but
the
state
also
may
not
keep
off
the
ballot
in
order
to
disadvantage
somebody
who
lacks
a
substantive
personal
characteristic
because
the
constitution
leaves
those
questions
to
the
voters
every
second
year.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
will
accept
that
with
this
exception.
i
think
the
arkansas
supreme
court
was
justified
in
saying
here
this
measure
is
impermissible
for
essentially
the
same
reason.
that
is
to
say,
the
lawmakers
of
arkansas,
the
people,
were
told,
and
then
they
said
in
the
measure
that
they
adopted,
that
the
measure
limited
the
terms
of
public
officials,
and
the
arkansas
supreme
court
simply
rejected
the
argument
that
something
that
did
that,
that
tried
to
impose
a
qualification,
if
you
will,
could
be
saved
on
the
argument
that
it
just
might
not
achieve
its
stated
purpose
because
of
a
loophole,
the
write-in
loophole
that
has
no
significant
history
of
working.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
storer
involved
a
legitimate
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation
designed
to
produce
a
fair
and
orderly
election
with
a
manageable
ballot
so
that
the
people
of
california
could
choose
by
saying
people
who
want
to
run
in
a
prim...
to
be
in
a
party
in
connection
with
a
particular
election
must
run
in
that
party's
primary
and
be
the
party's
candidate.
people
who
want
to
run
as
independents
must
leave
a
party
early
enough
to
assure
the
genuineness
of
their
independence
and
the
nonfracturing
of
the
party.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
it's
orderly
elections.
now,
it's
quite
different
from...
it's...
if
i
can
use
a
metaphor,
it's
like
the
difference
between
saying
that
someone
must
run
in
his
assigned,
qualifying
heat
in
order
to
get
into
the
finals
of
the
100-yard
dash,
and
saying
that
somebody
who
won
the
medal
last
time
must
start
50
yards
behind
the
others
because
we
want
to
pass
the
medals
around.
one
involves
procedural
regulation
that
the
constitution
authorizes
the
states
to
do,
and
the
other
involves
a
state
substantive
preference
for
one
class
of
candidates
over
another
that
i
think
is
not
part
of
the
entire
scheme
that
is
spelled
out
in
some
detail
in
the
constitution.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
and
there's
a
good
deal
of,
in
addition
to
text,
legislative
history
that
supports
this
reading.
if
you
read,
particularly
the
federalist
59
and
60.
now,
petitioners
aren't
very
clear,
to
say
the
least,
about
whether
the
state's
supposed
power
here
is...
is
a
power
granted
by
the
time,
place,
and
manner
clause
or
by
the
tenth
amendment.
i
suggest
the
reason
that
they're
not
very
clear
is
that
neither
argument
works.
the
constitution
explicitly
gives
congress
the
superior
power
to
make
election
regulations
or
to
alter
those
of
the
states,
but
it
plainly,
in
doing
so,
means
to
limit
the
power
of
both
the
states
and
congress
to
procedural
matters.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
that
a
state
can
impose
ballot
access
restrictions
under
some
power
outside
the
time,
place,
and
manner
clause
is
answered
in
the
clause
itself,
which
contains
the
phrase,
"make
or
alter",
and
incidentally,
the
primary
reason
for
that
phrase
was
a
fear
that
the
states
might
not
set
up
the
machinery
for
congressional
elections
at
all,
and
so
the
"make"
part
of
the
"make
or
alter"
phrase
is
an
important
part
of
it.
the
convention
deliberately
gave
congress
the
power
to
make
or
alter
state
regulations
because
hamilton
said
an
exclusive
power
of
regulating
elections
for
the
national
government
in
the
hands
of
the
state
legislatures
would
leave
the
union
entirely
at
their
mercy.
that's
the
federalist
number
59.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
don't...
if
you
mean
by
that
something--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--permissible--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--well--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no,
i
think--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--that's
right.
that's
right.
i
think
there
can
be--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
that's
right.
i
think
for
a
state
to
say,
on
the
whole
we
don't
think
people
over
70
ought
to
continue
to
serve
unless
their
constituents
really
want
them,
and
so
we'll
keep
them
off
the
ballot,
but
if
they
can
win
by
a
write-in
that's
okay.
i
think
that
is
not
a
valid
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation.
i
also
would
not
urge
that
anyone
call
it
a
qualification
for
the
reason
you
point
out,
that
it
is
merely
keeping
someone
off
the
ballot.
i
would
then
carve
out
an
exception
for
that
point
for
the--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
what...
i'm--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i'm--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
am...
i
am
reading...
if
that's
the
premise
as
to
what
it
says,
my
answer's
no.
as
to
what
arkansas
said,
my
answer
is
yes,
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
am
arguing
that
it
was
appropriate
for
the
arkansas
supreme
court
to
say
is
does--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i'm
willing
to...
yes.
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
that's
important,
and
i
don't
think
that
i've
made
a
significant
concession.
we
argue
in
the
second
section
of
the
brief
that
whether
something
is
a
qualification
is
not
technically
what's
at
issue
here.
the
constitution
bars
adding
qualifications.
it
also
bars
doing
essentially
the
same
thing
indirectly,
and
i
think
that
is
the
essence
of
what
the
arkansas
supreme
court
held,
that--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
but
i
also
say...
but
i
also
say
that
even
if
it
is
not
a
qualification,
it
is
something
that
the
states
have
no
power
to
do,
because
the
states
have,
as
congress
has,
only
the
power
that
is
granted
to
them
under
the
time,
place,
and
manner
clause,
and
the
time,
place,
and
manner
clause
does
not...
and
the
time,
place,
and
manner
clause
does
not
authorize
states
to
draw
this
kind
of
substantive
distinction
in
the
course
of
setting
procedures
for
elections.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
constitution
gave
the
states
power
to
determine
the
qualifications
of
electors
that
it
did
not
give
to
determine
the
qualifications
of
officeholders,
of
federal
officeholders.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
because
one
is
a
matter
of
the
state's
business,
and
the
other
is
not,
not
for
running
from
office...
not
for
running
from
federal
office.
there
was
a
period
of
time
when
i
was
qualified
to
be
president
of
the
united
states,
but
as
a
resident
of
the
district
of
columbia
i
wasn't
qualified
to
vote
for
one.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
make
a
distinction,
but
the
distinction
i
would
draw
is
that
it
seems
to
me
the
lifetime
inability
demonstrates
the
falsity
of
the
suggestion
that
this
has
something
to
do
with
incumbents.
i
think
that
a
bar
for
a
single
election
would
run
afoul
of
the
same
principle
that
i
am
asserting
here,
which
is,
again,
that
the
constitution
gave
that
choice
to
the
people
every
second
year,
and
gave
the
states
only
a
limited
and
fundamentally
procedural
role.
mr.
bryant
says
that
all
the
examples
of--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--well,
there
may
be
some
difficult
cases
in
drawing
lines.
in
the
speech
area
the
court
had
to
wrestle
with
whether
a
sound
limitation
on
a
rock
band
was
a
time,
place,
and
manner
limitation
or,
as
a
applied
to
that
band,
a
content
limitation.
this
is
a
clear
case.
this
is
an
easy
case.
the
court
has...
the
state
has
singled
out
people
based
on
a
personal
characteristic,
and
if
they
can
do
this
under
the
time,
place,
and
manner
clause,
congress
could
under
the
time,
place,
and
manner
clause,
it
seems
to
me,
keep
off
the
ballot
for
the
senate
anybody
who
hasn't
served
in
the
house,
and
so
on.
the
state
has
singled
out
for
this
burden
people
based
on
a
substantive
qualification
that
does
not
relate,
a
substantive
characteristic
that
does
not
relate
to
the
election
process
or
their
compliance
with
reasonable
procedures
established
by
the
state
under
its
power
under
the
time,
place,
and
manner
clause.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
story
only...
i
mean,
jefferson
only
in
one
letter
in
1814,
but
okay.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
actually,
if
you
sort
through
the
lengthy
appendices
attached
to
the
petitioner's
briefs,
there's
very
little
there.
the
single,
most
telling
episode
is
that
in
1789
pennsylvania
calls
a
constitutional
convention
to
eliminate
a
difference
between
its
constitution
and
the
federal
constitution
and
conflicts,
and
repeals
its
term
limits
for
service
in
congress
while
keeping
them
for
state
officers.
the
only
property
qualification
that
i'm
aware
of
is
that
virginia
had
the
word
"freeholder".
other
states
that
had
property
qualifications
for
state
offices
didn't
impose
them
on...
for
federal
officers.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
district
resident
qualifications
strike
me
as
the
kind
of
thing
that
somebody
might...
they
certainly
were
imposed.
they're
the
sort
of
thing
that
a
state
might
fall
into
in
making
the
arrangements.
under
the
time,
place
and
manner
clause
they
are
unconstitutional,
as
the
committee
on
elections
determined
in
1807
in
the
mccreary
case
and
as
several
courts
have
determined.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
it's
possible
that
not
every
state
went
back
and
read
the
annals
to
see
the
mccreary
episode
and
immediately
repealed
its
statute.
i
think
they
are,
and
would
be
held,
and
have
been
held
unconstitutional
because
the
voters
of
a
state
can,
if
they
choose,
pick
candidates
who
come
from
another
district.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
by
several
state
and
lower
federal
courts.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
actually,
yes,
i
think
most
of
the
cases
are
fairly
recent.
--the
constitution
gave
the
federal
government
only
delegated
powers
to
govern
people's
lives
and
activities,
but
it
seems
to
me,
again,
that
it
dealt
comprehensively
with
filling
the
offices
that
the
constitution
itself
created.
there's
an
overall
design
to
give
we,
the
people,
every
2
years
the
power
to
select
who
will
represent
them
in
congress,
subject
only
to
fixed
qualifications
and
reasonable,
fundamentally
procedural
regulations
that
the
state
has
given
power
to
adopt
subject
to
congressional
supersession.
if
now
congressional
term
limits
are
not
a
fad
but
are
considered
national
judgment,
the
way
to
impose
them
is
in
article
v.--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
thank
you.
