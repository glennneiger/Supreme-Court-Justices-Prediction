chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
93-1456,
u.s.
term
limits,
inc.,
v.
ray
thornton,
93-1828,
consolidated,
winston
bryant
v.
bobbie
e.
hill.
general
bryant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those...
you
say
the
first
amendment
issue
were
presented
to
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
but
not
decided
by
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
could
the
federal
legislature
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
are
you
suggesting
that
it
could
do...
the
federal
legislature
could
do
anything
more
than
simply
negate
a
state
regulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
would
be
the
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
do
more
than
just
negate
a
state
regulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
part
of
the
language
is
it
of
that
section
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
that
even
though,
perhaps,
a
state
hasn't
acted,
congress
could,
by
law,
make
regulations
governing
the
time,
place,
and
manner?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
arkansas
had
made
no
provision
for
term
limits
at
all,
could
congress
step
in
and
make
a
provision
for
term
limits?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kester,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
theory,
mr.
kester,
could
congress
say
that
no
person
shall
be
a
senator
who
is
not
over
the
age
of
25
and
have
that
the
controlling
qualification?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
saying
no
person
over
50
under
50,
saying...
you
know,
congress
obviously
was...
the
framers
were
concerned
about
age,
35,
and
you
know,
we're
also
concerned
about
age.
we
think
it
should
be
50.
could
that
override
the
35-year-old
provision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what's
your
answer,
under
your
theory?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
could
stand
up
under
the
framework
we're
talking
about
now,
article
i?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
held
age
is
not
a
suspect
classification.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
kester.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cohen,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
the
house
committee
on
elections,
mr.
cohen.
was
the
house
committee's
view
accepted
by
the
full
house?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
very
speculative,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
couldn't
the
full
house's
result
have
been
also
because
some
people
thought
that
he
was
in
fact
a
resident
of
baltimore,
that
he
complied
with
the
state
regulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
simply--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
what...
how
does
the
fact
that
the
scholarly
understanding...
does
that
elevate
what
actually
happened
into
something
different?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now
you're
not
talking
about
the
mccreary
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
only
got
40
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
more
clearly
than
hamilton,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
you're
mistaken
on
that,
mr.
cohen.
the
holding
of
powell
clearly
has
to
be
that
a
single
house
of
congress
cannot
add
to
the
qualifications
otherwise
legitimately
set.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
the
ultimate
holding,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
justify
sore-loser
statutes
on
the
basis
that
they
are
procedural.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
what
authority?
you
say
they've
been
held
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
recently,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
days,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
agree
that
was
not
the
holding
of
the
powell
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
dicta,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
we
don't...
we
are
not
bound
by
dicta.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
mccreary
episode,
where
now
it
appeared
apparently
to
the
powell
court
that
the
committee
report
had
the
same
validity
as
another
committee
report
which
was
adopted
by
the
full...
now
it
appears
this
report
was
not
adopted
by
the
house.
doesn't
that
cast
some
doubt
on
the
historical
abilities
of
the
powell
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
falsus
in
uno,
falsus
in
omnibus.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
days.
mr.
bryant,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining...
general
bryant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
bryant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
number
93-1456,
u.s.
term
limits
inc.
v.
thornton
inc.
and
a
companion
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
