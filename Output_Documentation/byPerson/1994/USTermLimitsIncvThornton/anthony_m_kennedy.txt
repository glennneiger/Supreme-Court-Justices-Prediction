justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
theory
that
by
this
rotation
the
policy
that
the
legislators
adopt
will
be
different
one
system
than
in
the
other
system?
that
is
to
say,
are
there
policy
implications
electing
an
incumbent
as
opposed
to
a
nonincumbent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you're
explaining
the
rationale
for
the
limitation,
and
i'm
asking
if
part
of
that
rationale
is
that
rotated
representatives
will
vote
differently
than
incumbents
would
have,
would
shape
public
policy
in
a
different
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
would
be
a
difference
in
the
kind
and
the
shape
and
the
policies
of
the
legislation
that
they
would
enact.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
that
the
justification
for
the
rule,
or
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
call
those
qualifications,
can
the
state
override
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--pardon
me,
can
the
congress
override
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
anything
the
state
adds
as
either
a
qualification
or
a
time,
place,
and
manner
can
be
overridden
by
the
congress?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
there
some
qualifications
that
the
state
can
add,
and
i...
this
was
suggested
by
justice
ginsburg's
question,
that
cannot
be
overridden
by
the
congress?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
we're
interested
to
know
is,
does
it
follow
from
that
that
the
congress
could
not
override
that
qualification?
where
does
the
constitution
give
the
congress
authority
to
override
qualifications?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
then
we're
right
back
where
we're--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let's
assume
that
we
tell
you
that
under
the
constitution
we
think
there
are
two
things,
two
semantic,
two
juridical
categories,
one
qualifications
and
the
other
time,
place,
and
manner.
now,
if
you
say,
and
if
you
assume
that
we
hold
that
term
limit
is
a
qualification,
we
are
exploring
whether
or
not
the
congress
could
override
that,
and
you
say,
oh,
well,
they
can
go
under
section
4,
but
we've
just
stipulated
this
is
a
qualification,
and
that
doesn't
apply
to
section
4.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
gravamen
of
the
argument
is
it
would
be
very
strange
to
allow
congress
to
override
a
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation,
but
not
to
override
a
greater
restriction,
which
is
a
qualification,
and
you're
not
answering
that
argument
because
you
keep
resorting
to
article
i,
section
4,
but
that's
a
very
odd
interpretation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not,
as
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
how
i
understood
your
brief.
your
first
argument
is
the
constitution
bars
states
and
congress
from
adding
to
the
qualifications
for
service
in
congress.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
begin
with
the
major
premise
that
a
qualification
cannot
be
added.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
you
say...
and
then
you
say,
and
this
is
so
like
a
qualification
that
it
must
be
invalid.
is
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
take
it
your
position
is,
is
that
the
state
can
require,
or
the
state
can
be
forbidden
from
requiring
its
officeholders
to
have
the
same
qualifications
as
its
electors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
a
state
could
bar
a
felon
from
voting
but
not
for
running
for
office?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
you
aware
of
any
case
in
which
we
have
said
that
a
state
may
impose
a
burden
or
restriction
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
someone
has
previously
exercised
a
federal
right
or
privilege?

m.

are
