but
once
they're
denied
the
ballot
access,
they're
denied
it
for
life,
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
the
permanency
of
the
denial
carry
a
suggestion
of
what
we
would
normally
refer
to
as
a
qualification?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
realize
that's
your
position,
but
in
any
case,
your
position
would
take
us
beyond
storer,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
storer...
maybe
my
recollection
is
wrong.
in
storer,
i
thought
there
wasn't
a
lifetime
disqualification.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
if
you...
you
know,
had
been
party-affiliated
within
a
certain
period
of
time,
you
couldn't
be
there
as
an
independent,
but
the
next
election
was
coming,
and
that
was
a
new
day.
isn't
that
right,
in
storer?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
storer
didn't
have
that
implication
of
permanence
which
is
in
fact
a
feature
of
the
arkansas
system.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
is
the
age
qualification
a
time,
place,
and
manner?
how
would
a
qualification
that
every
elected
senator
must
have
a
college
degree,
how
is
that
a
time,
place,
and
manner
qualification
or
condition?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
a
manner
condition,
as
it
were?
justice
david
h.
souter
on
that
assumption,
may
we
put
the
question
directly
that
justice
kennedy
alluded
to?
isn't
there
something
very
odd
in
a
scheme
in
which
the...
we'll
say
the
comparatively
less
important
conditions
that
fall
under
time,
place,
and
manner
can
be
overridden
by
congress,
and
yet
the
presumably
more
fundamental
conditions
known
as
qualifications
would
be
left
entirely
to
the
states?
if
they
couldn't
trust
the
states
on
time,
place,
and
manner,
wouldn't
it
be
odd
if
they
trusted
the
states
on
qualifications?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
don't
see
why
it
isn't
also
broad
enough
to
authorize
congress
to
act
in
the
first
instance.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
by
other
provisions
of
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
was
the...
do
you
remember
the
phrase
in
52?
i
can't
remember
the
text
that
you're
referring
to.
you
said
it
clearly
refers
to
the
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
powell
at
this
point
purport
to
go
beyond
the
decision
whether
congress
or
a
house
of
congress
could
act?
it
seems
to
me
that
it
did
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
limitation...
with
the
possible
exception
of
your
reference
to
52,
which
i'm
not
sure
of,
that
seems
to
me
the
problem
with
some
of
the,
or
at
least
the
limitation
on
the
cites
to
the
debate
text
and
say,
federalist
60.
it's
clearly
referring,
by
legislature,
to
the
national
legislature,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
supporting
legislative
history,
as
it
were,
doesn't
take
you
beyond
the
limitation
on
congress.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
go
back
to
storer
for
a
moment?
could
you
just
state
for
me
the
criteria,
the
standard
on
which
you
would
have
us
distinguish
the
storer
disability,
we'll
say,
from
this
disability?
justice
david
h.
souter
orderly
elections.
it's
orderly
elections
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
you
also,
or
wouldn't
you
also
in
that
case
accept
the
point
that
mr.
cohen
made,
that
there
was
a
justification
in
storer
based
on
a
demand
for
orderly
election
procedure,
and
that
compliments
the
point
that
you've
also
made
about
the
significance
of
the
permanence
of
the
disqualification
in
this
case?
