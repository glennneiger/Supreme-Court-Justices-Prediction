mr.
john
g.
kester
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
out,
i
think,
by
introducing--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--no,
not
precisely,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that
the
question
that
several
members
of
the
court
have
been
putting
really
illuminates
the
constitutional
structure
that
we're
talking
about
here,
and
the
argument
that
is
being
made
by
the
opponents
of
amendment
73,
first
of
all
skipping
over
and
pretending
that
it's
a
legal
incapacity
when
it's
nothing
of
the
kind...
it's
a
less
restrictive
alternative
that
the
state
has
adopted,
but
skipping
over
that
and
accepting
the
pretense
that
this
is
a
limitation
on
service
in
the
congress,
you're
then
put
to
the
task
of
fitting
together
some
provisions
of
the
constitution.
what
does
the
constitution
say
with
respect
to
the
power
of
congress
to
adopt,
say,
a
term
limits
provision
and
apply
it
to
the
states?
i
think
the
answer
to
that
has
to
begin
by
looking
at
the
sources
of
power
of
congress
and
of
the
states,
and
they
are
very
different.
congress
has
power
only
insofar
as
it
is
granted
in
the
constitution,
and
the
only
grant
of
power
to
congress
to
legislate
in
this
area
has
to
come
from
article
i,
section
4,
or,
i
quickly
amend,
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
which
is
also
part
of
article
i,
section
4,
and
nowadays
section
5
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
which
has
received
a
very,
very
broad
interpretation,
and
i
don't
think
that
we
need
to
address
that
at
this
time,
but
we
recognize
that
that's
very
broad.
the
sources
of
power
of
the
state
are
very,
very
different,
and
particularly
when
you
have
legislation,
a
constitutional
amendment
that
the
people
of
arkansas
adopted
and
imposed
on
themselves.
they're
not
reaching
out...
this
is
not
a
state
trying
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
in
other
states.
this
is
a
law
which,
if
anything,
hurts
the
people
of
arkansas.
mr.
john
g.
kester
no.
my
answer
would
be
no,
it
does
not,
for
the
following
reason.
i
would
say,
in
the
first
instance,
if
you
take
the
words
of
article
i,
section
4,
"make
or
alter",
and
say
that
those
are
of
equal
force,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
you
have
to
do
that
at
all,
i
would
say
congress
has
the
power
to
knock
out
any
state
law
with
respect
to
elections
that
congress
doesn't
like.
it's
very,
very
clear
that
that's
why
article
i,
section
4
was
put
in
the
constitution.
but
once
you
have
the
law
passed,
once
you
have
the
authority
of
congress
to
do
that
exercise,
that's
not
the
end
of
the
exercise,
that's
just
the
beginning.
this
court
pointed
that
out
in
williams
v.
rhodes.
there
may
be
power
there,
but
then,
has
the
power
been
properly
exercised?
first
of
all,
it
would
obviously
be
subject
to
attack
under
the
fifth...
the
equal
protection
aspects
of
the
fifth
amendment,
just
like
a
fourteenth
amendment
case,
which
is
what
this
really
is.
secondly,
you
would
have
to
test
it
under
the
tenth
amendment,
because
this
court
recognized
in
cases
like
new
york
v.
united
states,
gregory
and
ashcroft,
that
there
is
a
certain
core
of
state
authority
that
really
is
sacrosanct.
and
finally--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--right,
but
we're
talking
now,
as
i
understood
it,
justice
scalia,
we're
talking
about
congress
just
acting
in
the
first
instance,
and
i'm
saying
the
reason
congress
could
not
do
this
just
by
itself
in
the
first
instance,
say
we're
going
to
pass
a
statute
imposing
term
limits,
is
furthermore
that
you
have
another
provision
which
we
haven't
talked
about
yet
this
morning,
and
that's
article
i,
section
2,
clause
1,
and
that
says
the
people
shall
choose
their
representatives
in
the
house
of
representatives.
if
congress
did
that,
congress
would
be
acting
diametrically
opposed
to
what
the
people
have
done.
now,
this
is
all
hypothetical.
mr.
john
g.
kester
surely.
mr.
john
g.
kester
surely.
mr.
john
g.
kester
now
we're
talking
about
a
different
provision
of
the
constitution.
that's
article
ii.
mr.
john
g.
kester
right.
mr.
john
g.
kester
right,
but
i--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--justice
scalia,
i
would
say
that
the
tenth
amendment
applies
differently
in
different
situations,
and
you
have
to--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--because
the
question
would
be,
in
your
case
of
the
presidential
electors,
it's
like
the
case
of
williams
v.
rhodes.
ohio
came
in
there
and
said,
we
have
very
broad
authority
on
how
we
select
presidential
electors,
don't
tell
us
how
we
do
it,
we'll
decide
that,
and
this
court
said,
wait
a
second,
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
constitution,
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
generally
sufficient.
the
important
thing
is
that
the
state's
authority
draws
on
several
sources,
not
just
article
i,
section
4.
it
draws
on
the
tenth
amendment.
the
states
started
out
with
the
authority
to
do
this.
they
didn't
have
to
be
granted
it
at
all.
they
started
it
out.
it
was
reserved.
they
also
were
the
people
of
the
state,
and
remember,
it's
the
people
who
acted
here.
this
was--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--the
congress--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
believe,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
proper
understanding
of
section
4
is
that
was
the
check
that
the
framers
intended
to
place
on
the
states.
they
were
very
worried
about
what
kind
of
election
laws
the
states
would
pass.
mr.
john
g.
kester
any
of
those
things
which
would
be
fourteenth
amendment
issues,
yes.
manner
was
a
word
that
essentially
was
unlimited,
and
that
was
why
article
i,
section
4
was
so
controversial.
mr.
john
g.
kester
here
we're
construing
specific
language
in
the
constitution,
and
it's
different,
and
the
power
given
to
congress
was
broad
enough
to
do
whatever
was
necessary
to
keep
the
states
from
passing
inappropriate
legislation.
mr.
john
g.
kester
it
is...
justice
souter,
in
the
first
instance,
it
may
well
be,
but
then
congress
is
checked
in
a
number
of
ways,
and
in
some
ways
that
the
state
isn't,
particularly
if
you
look--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--by
other
provisions.
mr.
john
g.
kester
and
in
particular,
article
i,
section
2,
clause
1,
which
here
is
a
source
of
the
state's
power,
an
independent
source
of
the
state's
power,
but
when
congress
acts,
it
becomes
a
restriction,
if
anything,
on
congress'
power,
because
there
you
have
congress
going
in
and
saying
to
the
people
of
the
state,
you
can't
do
what
you
want.
mr.
john
g.
kester
to
that...
to
that--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--if--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--no.
no,
not
at
all,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
kester
no.
in
that
particular
case
it
might,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
kester
we're...
no,
no,
no,
no.
i'm
sorry,
i--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
did
not
express
myself
clearly,
then.
mr.
john
g.
kester
well,
whatever--
[laughter]
congress
has
power,
i
would
urge
upon
the
court,
and
i
think
that
this
is
very,
very
clear
when
you
look
at
the
history
of
article
i,
section
4.
congress
has
power
granted
there,
controversial
power...
a
lot
of
them
didn't
like
it...
to
go
in
and
say,
we
don't
like
your
state
election
law.
they
don't
even
have
to
say
it's
unconstitutional.
all
they
have
to
say
is,
we--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--well,
yes,
i
think
they
could,
because
otherwise
you're
driven,
and
this
is
where
some
of
the
argument--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--what
i'm
saying
is,
yes,
manner
is
the
broad
word...
that's
the
hook--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--surely.
it
has
to,
because
otherwise
as
i
believe
justice--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--otherwise
article
iv,
the
power
of
congress
in
article
iv
would
make
no
sense,
because
then
you'd
be
in
a
position,
and
this
is
where
the
solicitor
general's
argument
leaves
you,
is
saying
that
congress
would
have
the
power
to
override
minor
state
laws
but
not
huge--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--and...
and--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--and...
but
i
submit
that
my
theory
of
the
constitution,
justice
scalia,
has
historical
validity
and
makes
sense
when
you--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i...
if
congress
or
the
states
passed
a
law
that
was
absolutely
flat-out
contrary
to
those
provisions
in
article
i,
if
they've
made
it
contrary
to
it,
then
that
would
be
unconstitutional
just
on
the
face
of
it.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
think
there
you've
got
legislation
going
right
at
the
heart
of
provisions
that
were
put
in
the
constitution,
and
it
could
be
that
those
are
minimum
qualifications,
or
it
could
be
that
they
could
be
enhanced
with
respect
to
age
or
district
residence.
mr.
john
g.
kester
my
answer,
sir,
is
that
it
would
never
stand
up
under
the
fifth
amendment,
under
article
i,
section
2.
that--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--possibly
in
the
first
instance,
but
it
hardly
matters
because
it
would
so
clearly
violate
those
other
provisions.
mr.
john
g.
kester
well,
i
think--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--well--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
think
in
that
case
it
would
be,
and
in
looking
at
it
as
a
suspect--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--well,
it
would
have
to
be
judged.
it
would
have
to
be
judged
under
the
equal
protection
part
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
qualifications
clauses
are
there...
if
a
law
is
enacted
that
this
court
believes
contradicts
those
qualifications,
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes.
mr.
john
g.
kester
oh,
but
my
position
is
not
that
the
state
can
come
in
and
impose
any
qualification
it
wants
to,
it's
that
the
state--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--well,
any
qualification
that
doesn't
violate
the
other
restrictions
on
the
states,
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
mean,
this--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
defer
to
your
judgment
on
that,
but
the
analysis,
justice
stevens,
would
be
an
analysis--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--yes.
mr.
john
g.
kester
no,
i
said...
i
said
if
they
have
one
that's
absolutely
contradictory,
but
if
it's
not--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i'll
defer
to
your
honor
on
that.
mr.
john
g.
kester
well,
it
would
be
very
much
like
gregory
and
ashcroft,
wouldn't
it,
because
that
was
upheld,
a
mandatory
retirement
was
held
not
to
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
basically--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--the
states
have
done
things
like
that
for
200
years.
that's
our
point.
the
states
at
the
beginning
said,
not
only
do
you
have
to
be
a
resident
of
the
state,
you
have
to
be
a
resident
of
the
district.
now,
that's
a
supplementation,
that's
a
qualification.
mr.
john
g.
kester
mm-hmm,
and--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--oh,
not...
not
that,
but
states
have
added
qualifications
since
the
very
beginning,
and
incidentally,
they
called
them
time,
place,
and
manner
regulations.
mr.
john
g.
kester
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
