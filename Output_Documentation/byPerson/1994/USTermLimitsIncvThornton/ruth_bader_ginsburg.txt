justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--precedent,
any
case
where
a
group
based
on
past
experience,
past
lawful
experience,
has
been
categorically
hobbled
in
this
way.
it's
not
simply
a
handicap
in
the
race
if
the
only
access
they
have
is
as
a
write-in,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
trying
to
contrast
a
mere
handicap
from
a
hobbling,
and
it
seems
to
me
this
falls
in
the
latter
category.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you've
mentioned
that
there
were
qualifications
that
don't
come
from
the
constitution
itself.
you
started
out
your
argument
by
saying
the
states
could
add
qualifications.
now
you've
told
us
that
there
are
only
two
categories,
there's
qualifications,
and
there's
time,
place,
and
manner,
but
you
see
two
categories
of
qualifications,
i
gather,
because
you've
told
us
that
some
come
from
the
constitution,
and
then
there
are
others
the
states
can
add.
so
what's
the
category
of
qualifications,
extra-constitution,
that
the
state
can
add
that
are
not
time,
place,
and
manner
regulations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
test
of
whatever
the
state
does,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
it
could
be
overridden
by
congress,
but
congress
has
to
come
second?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whether
the
state
is
acting
under
the
tenth
amendment,
or
whatever
source.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
time,
place,
and
manner
is
not
a
limitation,
as
you
see
it.
it
includes
what
one
might
think
of
as
time,
place,
and
manner,
plus
qualifications,
including
age
60
is
the
limit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
we
should
forget
all
about
the
way
we
use
time,
place,
and
manner
in
the
context
of
the
first
amendment
where
it's
a
limited
category
of
things
that
don't
go
to
the
core
of
free
expression,
but
here
you
say
it
covers
everything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
kester,
let's
take
an
age...
you
can't
run
after
the
age
of
70,
instead
of
upping
the
age
from
35,
a
mandatory
retirement.
wouldn't
that
get
you
out
of
your
equal
protection
problem?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
that
was
the
qualification,
nobody
can
run
in
this
state
after
the
age
of
70,
the
state
could
do
that,
and
that
would
be
a
qualification--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
are
states
that
have
said
you
can't
run
after
the
age
of
so-and-so
for
congress?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
states
have
done
that
for
years,
put--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
do
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
cohen,
may
i
ask
whether
in
your
view
we
owe
any
kind
of
precedential
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
history
in
powell
v.
mccormack?
we're
not
dealing
here
with
a
new
discovery
by
professor
warren,
we're
dealing
with
what
has
already
gone
over.
mr.
kester
has
told
us
that...
that
perhaps
some
of
the
statements
there,
some
of
the
conclusions
weren't
quite
right,
that
there
was
room
for
other
interpretations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
believe
listed
the
language
from
section
4.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
take
it
you
did
not
mean
to
concede
that
a
state
could
say
you
have
to
be
a
republican,
or
you
have
to
be
a
democrat,
that
you
could
be
an
independent--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
have
to
be
independent
early
enough
to
make
it
persuasive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
addition...
what
was
the
federal
right
or
privilege
exercised
in
storer,
which
was
someone
who
had
signed
up
as
a
member
of
a
party
and
didn't
quit
early
enough?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
the
most
temporal
of
limitations,
though.
it's
kind
of
like
you
have
to
be
living
in
a
state
a
certain
amount
of
time
before
you
can
get
a
divorce.
it
was...
it's
very
transient.
