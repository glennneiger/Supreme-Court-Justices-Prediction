justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
you
leave
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--could
i
go
back
to
what
i
think
is
justice
o'connor's
question,
which
is,
i
take
that
your
basic
position
is
that
no
additional
qualifications
can
be
provided
by
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
it
says
they
shall
choose
whoever
they
want,
the
constitution,
subject
to
certain
listed
disqualifications.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
birth
would
be
no
good,
property
would
be
no
good,
being...
service
in
the
legislature
would
be
no
good,
term
limits
would
be
no
good,
and
being
a
pre...
and
being
a
member
of
a
political
party
such
as
being
chosen
by
the
democrats
or
republicans
would
be
no
good.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
all
right.
but
then
in
storer,
i
take
it
it's
okay
to,
through
this
back
door,
insist
on
one
of
the
qualifications,
namely,
being
chosen
by
the
party.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why,
then,
isn't
it
okay
to
insist
on
this
other
one,
namely
the
term
limits
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that...
i
mean
you...
i
just
want
to
get
a
very
clear--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
it
were
a
qualification,
then
would
you
lose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why,
if
we're
thinking
on
qualification,
i
take
it
if
the
states
can
pass
qualification
such
as
the
one
at
issue,
they
also
could
pass
qualifications
setting
requirements
of
birth,
or
property,
or
previous
service
in
the
state
legislature,
or
add
on
to
the
list
almost
indefinitely,
and
why
should
we
think
that
the
constitution,
particularly
with
hamilton
and
madison,
intended
to
give
the
states
the
power
to
create
that
kind
of
congress?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
my
question
actually
was
why
would
hamilton
or
madison,
who,
after
all,
were
writing
before
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
passed,
think
that
it
was
possible
that
this
constitution
would
permit
qualifications
for
the
congress
based
upon
birth
or
property,
and
why
would
we
today
think
that
a
state
could
pass
a
rule
saying
to
be
in
congress
you
have
to
be
a
previous
member
of
the
state
legislature,
for
example?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
therefore
hamilton
and
madison,
when
they
wrote
the
federalists
and
said
to
the
people,
don't
worry
about
creating
a
government
of
birth
or
property,
that
they
were
wrong
in
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
was
before--
