justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
that?
i'm
not
sure
how
that
makes
it
a
qualification.
it
seems
to
me
the
test
for
whether
it's
a
qualification
is
whether,
when
a
person
has
been
supposedly
elected
and
reports
to
congress,
congress
can
sit
in
judgment
and
say,
this
person
is
not
qualified.
now,
if
that
should
happen,
what
disqualification
would
there
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
in
hawaii
the
person
gets
on
the
ballot
by
mistake,
or
in
arkansas.
an
incumbent
who
has
no
right
to
be
on
the
ballot
is
put
on
the
ballot
and
gets
elected,
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
reports
to
congress.
now,
could
congress
sit
in
judgment
and
exclude
that
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then
it
is
a
qualification
in
arkansas.
do
you
say
that
if
somebody
gets
on
the
ballot
by
mistake
in
arkansas
and
is
elected,
congress
can
exclude
that
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
talking
about,
hawaii
exclusion
from
the
ballot
system.
it's
not
a
term
limit
proposal,
it's
just
exclusion
from
the
ballot,
but
entirely.
no
write-in
allowed,
either,
and
the
arkansas
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
they
couldn't
with
respect
to
hawaii,
either.
hawaii
doesn't
say
you
shall
not
serve,
it
just
says
you
shall
not
get
on
the
ballot,
and
people
will
not
be
able
to
vote
for
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
that
happens,
you're
not
unqualified.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask
you...
you
say
that
this
is
not
a
qualification.
is
it
a
time,
place
or
manner
restriction?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is.
is
there
such
a
thing
as
something
that
is
neither
the
one
nor
the
other,
it
is
neither
a
qualification
nor
a
time,
place
and
manner
restriction?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
either
one
or
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
everything
falls
into
one
or
the
other
category.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
time,
place,
and
manner,
this
means,
of
course,
that
the
current
congress,
composed
mainly
of
incumbents,
can
simply
revise
the
arkansas
law
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
indeed,
the
current
congress
could
revise
those
laws
that
don't
provide
for
term
limitations
or
don't
provide
for
exclusion
from
ballot
access
to
incumbents.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
in
effect
you
could
have
the
federal
legislature
doing
something
that
discourages...
that
discourages
incumbency.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
where
do
you
get
that?
you
don't
get
that
from
the
tenth
amendment.
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
time,
place,
and
manner,
not
qualifications.
i
thought
you
make
a
distinction
between
the
two.
you
make
no
distinction
between
time,
place,
and
manner
and
qualifications?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
must
be...
50
has
nothing
to
do
with
time,
place,
and
manner
of
elections
at
all.
it
has
to
do
purely
with
qualifications.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
can
understand
why
you
argue
the
states
can
on
the
basis
of
the
tenth
amendment.
i
don't
know
where
the
congress
gets
the
power
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
doesn't
relate
to
qualifications,
that
relates
to
time,
place,
and
manner.
is
there
no
qualification
that
is
not
a
time,
place,
and
manner
provision?
every
qualification
is
a
time,
place,
and
manner
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
every
qualification--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
a
time,
place,
and
manner
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
you
might
have
responded
that
perhaps
they
were
willing
to
trust
the
federal
congress
with
respect
to
the
relatively
minor
matters
of
time,
place,
and
manner--
[laughter]
--but
not
willing
to
trust
the
federal
congress
with
respect
to
the
greater
matter
of
qualifications.
that's
a
possibility,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
more
specifically,
gives
you
the
power
to
override
that
state
authority
if
it
exists
under
10.
section
4
says
specifically
that
congress
can
make
or
alter
such
regulations.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
ask
you
about
the
tenth
amendment,
before
we
get--
justice
antonin
scalia
--too
far
away
from
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that
is
the
source
of
the
state's
power
that
you
assert
would
justify
this
piece
of
legislation,
then
i
assume
that
the
state
could
also
say
that
the
state's
electors
shall
not
vote
for
a
president
who,
in
addition
to
having
the
qualifications
set
forth
in
article
ii
of
the
constitution,
has
certain
other
qualifications.
could
the
state
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
we
are--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
tenth
amendment
hasn't
changed.
it's
still
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
can
add
conditions
to
whom
its
citizens
may
vote
for
for
their
representatives,
why
may
it
not
add
conditions
to
the
person
for
whom
its
electors
may
vote
for
as
president?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
that's
very
convenient,
but
i
don't
know
why.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
that
is
a
restriction,
it
just
negates...
it
just
negates
section
4.
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever
the
people--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
is
okay,
so...
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
possibly
read
it
that
broadly,
or
it
negates
section
4.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
the
people
of
a
state
vote
for
this
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction,
congress
can't
do
anything
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought
you
were
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
i
didn't
understand
clearly,
i
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
make
no
sense
unless
there
is
a
prohibition
upon
additional
qualifications,
in
which
case
it
would
make
perfect
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
only
would
make
no
sense
under
your
theory
of
the
constitution.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
they
put
it
differently,
then,
mr.
cohen?
the
briefs
here
have
been
referring
to
this
as
a
qualifications
clause.
it's
really
not
a
qualifications
clause,
it's
a
disqualifications
clause.
they
could
have
said,
every
person
shall
be
eligible
to
serve
in
the
house
of
representatives
who
shall
attain
to
the
age
of
25
years,
shall
have
been
7
years
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
and
shall
not
when
elected...
and
shall
be
when
elected
an
inhabitant
of
that
state
in
which
he
shall
be
chosen,
a
very
easy
way
to
say
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
took
the
circuitous
route
of
saying,
no
person
shall
be
a
representative
who
shall
not
have
attained
the
age
of
25
years,
been
7...
in
other
words,
you
can't,
unless
you
have
these
conditions,
but
that
isn't
to
say
that
just
because
you
meet
these
conditions
you
are
eligible.
it
does
not
say
that,
and
john
randolph--
justice
antonin
scalia
--pointed
this
out
in
the
first
congressional
debate
on
the
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
does,
he
was
making
a
mistake,
wasn't
he,
because
he
also
was
excluding
the
states'
power
to
change
the
qualifications
of
electors--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
it
obviously
could.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
much
of
a
fixing.
the
fact
is,
the
states
could
change
it
so
long
as
they
were
willing
to
change
it
for
their
most
numerous
branch
of
the
legislature.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
say
it's
a
mistake?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
can't
possibly
be
straightforward,
because
congress
would
need
to
have
been
given
the
power
to
make
the
alteration.
that
power
would
have
had
to
be
found
within
the
constitution.
with
respect
to
the
states,
that
is
not
true.
with
respect
to
the
states
you
have
the
main
thing
that's
relied
on
here,
the
tenth
amendment.
there's
nothing
in
powell
about
the
tenth
amendment,
is
there?
we
didn't
even
consider
the
tenth
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
going
to
have
you
do
that,
but
you're
trying
to
not
have
to
do
it
by
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we've
decided
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--already
in
powell.
justice
antonin
scalia
those
things,
if
you
do
it
on
those
bases
it
converts
itself
from
a
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction
to
a
qualification?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
a
qualification,
i
assume
that
the
house
would
sit
in
judgment
of
whether
that
qualification
was
met.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
serve
if
you
don't
have
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
not
the
case
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe,
but
certainly
not
because
the
state
is
adding
an
additional
qualification.
i
mean,
it
may
be
bad,
but
not
for
the
reason
that
it's
violating
the
presumably
exclusive
qualifications
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cohen,
what
is
your
view
as
to
whether
something
can
be
neither
the
one
nor
the
other,
neither
a
qualification
nor
a
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction?
is
there
some--
justice
antonin
scalia
--some
restriction
that
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--something...
no,
not
permissible.
justice
antonin
scalia
something
that...
whether
it's
permissible
or
not,
is
there
anything
that
does
not
fall
within
one
or
the
other
category?
i
gathered
from
your
answer
to
my
earlier
question
that
you
thought
that
there
wasn't.
this
might,
indeed,
be
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it's
impermissible,
but
not
because
it
is
technically
a
qualification.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
also
not
a
time,
place,
and
manner.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
is
a
third
something-or-other,
but
an
impermissible
third--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
a
very
reasonable
one,
mr.
cohen.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cohen,
maybe
you
think
this
is
a
clear
case.
some
aspects
of
it
at
least
i
find
very
close,
where
you
have
thomas
jefferson
and
joseph
story
on
opposite
sides
of
the
issue,
for
example,
whether
the
states
have
any
power
to
add
qualifications.
that's
a
close
case
in
my
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
letter
he
never
retracted.
story--
[laughter]
in
any
case,
just
posit...
posit
that
i
think
on
that
question
at
least
it's
very
hard
and
very
close,
and
in
situations
like
that
i
am
inclined
to
credit
the
practice
that
has
been
engaged
in
from
the
time
when
the
constitution
was
written,
and
there
have,
indeed,
been
a
considerable
number
of
state
additional
qualifications,
i
guess
the
most
common
being
that
in
order
to
run
for
office
you
have
to
be
qualified
as
a
voter,
which
brings
in
all
sorts
of
qualifications.
you
can't
be
a
felon,
and
so
forth.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
in
addition
to
some
property
qualifications
in
virginia,
in
the
early
days.
justice
antonin
scalia
district
resident
qualifications.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
were
quite
a
few
of
them,
and
they
persist.
they're
still
out
there,
aren't
they,
these
horrible
things?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
all
in
big
trouble
if
that
maxim
is
going
to
be
applied,
i
must
say.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
a
qualification,
congress
has
to
be
able
to
judge
it.
now,
let's
assume
that
somebody
gets
elected
without
complying
with
the
qualification.
somehow
his
name
gets
on
the
arkansas
ballot
accidentally,
by
a
mistake
or
by
some
corrupt
act,
and
he
gets
elected,
and
he
appears
before
the
house,
and
the
committee
is
to
judge
his
qualifications.
can
they
exclude
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
i
mean,
assuming
that
this
is
a
qualification,
and
a
valid
qualification.
justice
antonin
scalia
assuming
it's
a
qualification,
and
a
valid
qualification,
i
don't
see
how
any
congressional
committee
could
possibly
exclude
him.
he's
entitled
to
serve.
he's
been
elected.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
is
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--disabled
from
serving.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suggest
the
reason
is
because
it
is
not
a
qualification.
arkansas
has
not
said,
this
person
may
not
serve.
it's
simply
said,
this
person
may
not
run
for
office
and
be
listed
on
the
ballot.
if
he
accidentally
gets
listed
on
the
ballot,
he
may
serve.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
seems
to
me
to
say
it's
not
a
qualification.
it's
something.
maybe
you
can
argue,
as
mr.
cohen
does,
it
has
the
same
effect
and
therefore
it's
bad--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you're
trying
to
argue
that
it
is
itself
a
qualification,
and
that
just
flies--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
well,
i'll...
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
argument
i
can
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
people
who
voted
for
this
constitution
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
care
what
the
committee
said
and
what
the
committee
changed.
i
mean,
it
was
the
constitution
as
written
that
was
promulgated
to
the
people,
and
they
adopted
it,
reading
it
as
it
was
written.
i
don't
think
they
knew
what
happened
in
the
committee
of
style.
justice
antonin
scalia
or,
you
know,
i'm
not
sure
that
we
do.
i
mean,
we're
taking
james
madison's
word
for
it
all,
i
guess.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
could
do
worse,
couldn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
guess
that
madison
and
hamilton
and
the
people
they
were
writing
for
weren't
worried
about
their
state
legislatures.
they
felt
that
their
state
legislatures
were
responsive
to
the
people.
they
were
worried
about
whether
this
new
animal
that
was
being
created
would
be
responsive
to
the
people,
and
they
weren't
about
to
give
it
vast
powers
to
impose
qualifications
that
their
own
people
didn't
like.
that's
the
only
explanation
for
the
fact
that
in
all
of
this
discussion
there's
no...
in
the
debates
there's
no
categorical
mention
about
this
issue
about
the
states
adding
qualifications.
they
weren't
worried
about
the
states.
the
states
were
the
people
as
far
as
they
were
concerned.
isn't
that
the
response
to
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--madison
and
hamilton--
