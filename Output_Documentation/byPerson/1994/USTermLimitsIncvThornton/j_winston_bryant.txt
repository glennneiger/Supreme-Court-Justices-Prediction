mr.
j.
winston
bryant
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
arkansas
is
before
this
court
today
defending
its
constitutional
authority
to
encourage
rotation
in
office
of
its
congressional
delegation.
amendment
73,
which
would
have
accomplished
that
objective
was
ruled
unconstitutional
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
the
court
held
that
amendment
73
amounted
to
a
qualification
and,
further,
that
the
state
of
arkansas
could
not
add
additional
qualifications
to
those
listed
in
article
i,
sections
2
and
3.
we
disagree
with
that
ruling.
amendment
73
is
not
a
qualification,
but
even
if
it
is
a
qualification,
the
state
of
arkansas
has
the
authority
to
add
additional
qualifications
to
those
listed
in
article
i,
sections
2
and
3.
our
founding
fathers
envisioned
a
congress
of
citizen
legislators
who
would
serve
awhile,
return
and
xx
with
the
people,
and
not
stay
in
office
indefinitely,
and
during
the
18th
and
19th
centuries,
voluntary
rotation
was
a
common
practice.
during
the
20th
century,
we
have
seen
a
dramatic
increase
in
the
number
of
long-term,
entrenched
incumbents.
entrenched
incumbency
makes
for
an
electoral
system
that
is
less
fair,
less
competitive,
and
less
representative.
amendment
73
was
adopted
in
1992
by
the
people
of
arkansas
overwhelmingly,
by
a
60
percent
to
40
percen
majority.
twenty-two
states
now
have
some
form
of
term
limit
proposals
or
ballot
access
initiatives
on
their
books.
thirty-seven
states
have
term
limits
that
limit
the
terms
of
the
executive
branch
officials
of
those
states
or
the
legislative
branch
officials
of
those
states.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court,
however,
but
the
people
of
arkansas,
by
amendment
73,
have
decided
to
encourage
rotation
in
office
to
make
the
election
process
more
fair
and
more
competitive.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
your
honor,
they
would
be
more
beholden
to
the
people
under
the
theory
of
amendment
73
because
they
would
not
be
career
politicians.
they
would
be
more
responsive
to
the
people.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
there
could
be,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
your
honor.
amendment
73
provides
for
strict
term
limits
for
certain
state
elected
officials
in
arkansas.
it
denies
ballot
access
to
multiterm
congressional
incumbents,
but
does
allow
those
incumbents,
after
serving
a
maximum
number
of
terms
allowed
by
amendment
73,
to
run
as
a
write-in
candidate.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
no,
your
honor.
the
definition
of
a
ballot
access
proposal
like
amendment
73
as
opposed
to
a
qualification
is
put
forth
in
our
brief,
and
that
is,
a
qualification
is
something
that
absolutely
prohibits
a
candidate
from
serving
even
if
elected.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
state's
position
is
that
amendment
73
is
consistent
with
storer,
the
difference
being
that
under
amendment
73
a
candidate
can
actually
serve
a
couple
of
terms
in
the
senate,
or
three
terms
in
the
house,
so
it
does
not
absolutely
prohibit
a
candidate
from
serving.
after
that
candidate
reaches
a
maximum
number
of
terms,
then
obviously
that
candidate
is
denied
access
to
the
ballot.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
your
honor,
to
answer
your
question,
the
state
does
not
take
the
position
that
amendment
73
is
an
absolute
handicap,
because
we're
dealing
with
multiterm
incumbents
who
would
have
great
name
recognition,
resources
available
to
them
that
ordinary
challenges
would
not
have.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
no,
your
honor.
the
state's
position
is
that
amendment
73
will
allow
a
candidate
to
serve
even
if
elected,
and
under
that
scenario,
under
that
definition
that
we
put
forth
to
this
court,
would
amount
to
only
a
ballot
access
regulation.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
your
honor,
there
are--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
amendment
73
is
also
consistent
with
this
court's
jurisprudence.
in
burdick
v.
takushi,
a
case
from
hawaii,
in
that
particular
case,
the
state
of
hawaii
had
adopted
a
statutory
scheme
that
allowed
write-in
voting
to
be
completely
banned.
in
this--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--your
honor--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--it
would
become
a
qualification
at
that
point,
if
there
is
no
write-in
provision,
but
even
assuming--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--your
honor,
under
that
scenario,
congress
can
consider
the...
obviously
can
consider
under
article
i,
section
5,
the
qualifications,
and
under
the
position
of
the
state
in
this
particular
case,
a
pure
write-in,
a
pure
term
limits
proposal--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--if--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--yes,
your
honor.
under
article
i,
section
5,
if
the
person
were
not
properly
qualified,
yes.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
your
honor,
i
was
considering
it
under
a
pure
term
limits
proposal.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
under
amendment--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--and
under
the
arkansas
system,
your
honor,
the
congress
could
not
consider
the
amendment
73
proposal
as
a
qualification
under
that
scenario.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
neither
a
qualifica...
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
it's
either
one--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--according
to
our--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--that
would
probably
fall
under
time,
place,
and
manner,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--it
would
be
the
manner.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
but,
your
honor,
that
would
have
to
undergo
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
scrutiny
if
that
proposal
were
adopted
by
the
state.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
your
honor,--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--yes,
your
honor,
under
article
1,
section
4.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
the
federal
legislature,
your
honor,
is
given
authority
under
article
i,
section
4,
to
override
anything
the
states
do
in
the
area.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
article
i,
section
4
would
give
congress
that
authority,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
the
term
4,
has
a
very
broad,
expansive
meaning,
and
during
the
ratification
debates
the
states
were
concerned
about
the
fact
that
under
article
i,
section
4,
congress
was
being
given
the
authority
which
the
states
concluded
would
allow
congress
to
override
anything
the
states
did
in
the
area.
the
article
i,
section
4
clause
was
sold
on
the
basis
that
congress
needed
the
authority
or
power
to
preserve
its...
the
union,
if
necessary,
and
so
article
i,
section
4
has
a...
is
very
broad
in
its
meaning,
and
would
authorize
congress
to
adopt
legislation
in
the
area.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
congress
could
override
amendment
73
if
congress
so
desired.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
your
honor,
under
article
i,
section
4,
congress
could
do
that.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
your
honor,
the
qualifications
that
the
states
could
add
would
all
be
time,
place,
and
manner
under
article
i,
section
4.
also
the
state
could,
if
there
are
some
enumerated...
if
article
i,
section
4
does
not
cover
some
particular
areas,
amendment
10
would
allow
the
states
to
act
in
that
particular
area,
but
the
states
have
always
added
additional
qualifications.
in
fact,
when
the
constitution
was
adopted
by
the
states,
the
state
of
virginia
had
a
property
qualification
as
well
as
a
residency
requirement.
james
madison--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
i'm
sorry--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--yes,
your
honor,
the
congress
could
under
article--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--your
honor,
the
specific
provisions
that
can
be
overridden
by
congress
are
the
article
i,
section
4
grants
of
authority
to
the
states
by--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--none
comes
to
mind,
your
honor.
the
states--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
congress
can
impose
additional
qualifications.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
article
1,
section
4.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
your
honor,
but
under
our
definition
the
congress
can
add
additional
qualifications
based
on
article
1,
section
4
authority,
and
congress
has
done
so
since
the
very
first
congress.
in
the
very
first
congress--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--congress
could
pass--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--yes.
yes,
your
honor,
they
could
pass
such
a
statute
sub...
of
course,
it
would
be
subject
to
first
and
fifth
amendment.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
comes
under
article
i,
section
4
authority,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
we
make
a
distinction,
your
honor.
the...
the
narrow--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--the
narrow
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
amendment
73
amounts
to
a
ballot
access
regulation.
if
it
amounts
to
a
qualification,
the
states
as
well
as
congress
can
add
additional
qualifications
to
those
listed
in
article--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--and
that
is
under
article
1,
section
4,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
state's
position.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
under
that--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--under
that
theory
we
advance.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
oh,
your
honor,
that
is
a
time,
place,
and
manner
because
if
the
state
of
arkansas
or
congress
did
that,
that
would
be...
that
is
constitutional,
according
to
our
position,
under
article
i,
section
4.
however,
it
would
have
to
pass
constitutional
muster,
and
that
is
the
test.
under
the
ballot
access--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--yes,
your
honor.
that
could
be
considered
a
manner
condition
under
article
i,
section
4.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
your
honor,
the
state's
argument
is
that
amendment
73
amounts
to
a
ballot
access
regulation.
that
is
the
narrow
issue
that
this
court
can
reach.
if
amendment
73
does
in
fact
amount
to
a
qualification
as
determined
by
this
court,
then
it's
the
state's
position
that
the
state
of
arkansas
can
add
additional
qualifications
under
article
i,
section
4
to
those
enumerated
in
the
constitution.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
because,
your
honor,
that
qualification
would
be
adopted
under
article
i,
section
4.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
under
that--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--your
honor,
under
that
scenario,
then
the
states
would
have
the
authority
under
amendment
10.
congress
would
not
have
the
authority
under
your
scenario
to
add
additional
qualifications.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
under
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
ballot
access
jurisprudence,
the
states
can
erect
barriers
or
limitations
to
limit
the
field
of
candidates,
and
so
long
as
that
passes
constitutional
muster,
then
the
states
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
thank
you.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
the
honorable
senator
mclellan
served
at
least
five
terms,
and
was
probably
into
his
sixth
term.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
two
points,
your
honor.
first
is
the
respondents...
mr.
cohen
has
conceded
that
amendment
73
does
not
amount
to
a
qualification.
under
that
scenario,
it
is
the
state's
position,
as
i
originally
stated,
that
amendment
73
is
a
ballot
access
regulation
clearly
permissible
under
article
i,
section
4
of
the
constitution,
and
the
arkansas
court
held
that
amendment
73
was,
in
fact,
a
qualification.
under
that
scenario,
we
request
the
court...
this
court
to
reverse
the
arkansas
court
and
remand--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
your
honor,
under
your
scenario,
article...
the
states
can
add
additional
qualifications.
that
is
our
position.
any
qualifications
added,
of
course,
would
be
subject
to
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
scrutiny,
so
any
scenario
that
the
state
came
up
with
that
violated
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
would,
in
fact,
not
pass
constitutional
muster.
the
tenth
amendment
gives
the
states
the
authority
to
adopt
additional
qualifications,
and
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
here,
the
states,
all
the
states
in
this
union
have
a
number
of
qualifications
on
their
books.
arkansas
requires
a
candidate
for
congress
to
be
a
registered
voter.
a
registered
voter
cannot
be
a
felon
or
a
mental
incompetent.
arkansas...
the
arkansas
constitution
prohibits
a
senator
who
is
appointed
from
running
for
reelection,
so
arkansas
has
a
number
of
laws
on
its
books,
both
statutory
and
constitutional,
that
amount
to
qualifications
under
the
respondent's
theory,
and
if
qualifications--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--your
honor,
our
position
is
that
madison
and
hamilton
did
not
preclude
the
state
from
adding
additional
qualifications
under
the
tenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
your
honor,
no,
your
honor,
because
under
the
state's
position
any
qualification
that
went
to
the
point
you
suggested
would
be
unconstitutional
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--yes,
your--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--yes.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
[laughter]
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
if
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor,
yes,
i
think
the
storer
case
fit
that,
i
think
the
burdick
case
fit
that,
and
the
test
in
those
cases,
those
cases
stood
for
the
proposition
that
a
state
can't
add
additional
qualifications
or
barriers--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--your
honor,
in
storer,
the
federal
right
or
privilege
would
have
been
the
candidate
attempting
to
run
for
congress
as
an
independent
candidate,
but
was
precluded
from
doing
so
by
california
law,
and
in
that
particular
instance,
the
state
had
erected
a
barrier,
but
by
the
same
token
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
analysis,
the
state...
that
barrier
passed
constitutional
muster,
and
we
submit
that
amendment
73
falls
in
that
category
and
is
clearly
authorized--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--i'm...
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
those
prohibitions
were
temporary
in
that
the
candidate
could
run
subsequently,
but
by
the
same
token,
amendment
73
allows
a
candidate
to
serve
for
a
certain
number
of
terms
before
amendment
73
comes
into
effect.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
thank
you.
