mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
reinforce
the
extraordinary
and
anomalous
nature
of
petitioner's
argument
in
terms
of
the
power
of
congress.
we
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
powell
v.
mccormack
and
the
nixon
case
are
that
congress
may
not
add
to
the
textual
qualifications
set
out
in
the
constitution
with
respect
to
service
in
congress.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
also
want
to
underscore
the
fact
that
this
court,
after
an
exhaustive
review
of
the
preconstitutional...
the
constitutional
convention,
the
ratification,
and
the
post-ratification
history,
concluded
that
those
requirements
were
fixed
in
the
constitution.
i
think
that's
the
reading
of
powell
and
nixon
together.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
that
this
case
does
not
necessitate
this
court's
reviewing
the
history
that
it
found
in
powell
v.
mccormack,
and
much
of
the
evidence
that's
been
brought
forward
was
addressed
by
this
court
here.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
one
piece,
and
i
think
my
cocounsel
is
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
be
the
last
person
to
suggest
that
this
court
was
in
error
when
it
reviewed
the
history
in
powell
v.
mccormack.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
let's
look
at
the
argument
that
the
petitioners
have
put
forward.
they
seem
to
rely
principally
upon
the
times,
places,
and
manner
provision,
article
i,
section
4,
but
we
have
to
remember
that
the
power
there
is
one
shared
coextensively
by
congress.
where
does
that
lead
the
petitioners
with
respect
to
their
arguments?
if
it
is
a
qualification,
then
the
states
may
add,
and
the
congress
may
add.
if
that's
what
they're
relying
upon,
this
creates
an
interesting
situation
that
i
think
justice
scalia
and
justice
souter
were
alluding
to.
that
is,
if
the
states
can
set
qualifications,
then
presumably,
under
article
i
section
5,
congress
can
judge
those
qualifications
not
against
the
constitutional,
textual
qualifications,
but
the
potentially
myriad
qualifications
that
states
could
set
up
along
the
lines
of
the
ones
that
have
been
provided
by
amendment
73.
if
it
is
a
manner,
then
the
states
may
bar
access
to
the
ballot,
but
congress
also
may
bar
access
to
the
ballot,
and
it
is
not
a
power
in
congress
that
has
to
await
action
by
the
states.
the
term
is
73
imposes.
but
we
would
suggest
that
this
is
not
a
manner.
this
is
not
times,
places,
and
manner.
this
is
a
qualification.
with
due
respect
to
my
cocounsel,
i
think
it's
unavoidable
that
this
is
a
qualification.
let
me
suggest
why
that
is
so.
first
of
all,
the
times,
places,
and
manner
requirement,
as
my
cocounsel
has
set
out,
was
designed
to
ensure
the
fairness
and
the
efficiency
and
the
accuracy
of
the
legislative
process,
the
electoral
process.
justice
ginsburg,
you
pointed
out
that
in
our
first
amendment
jurisprudence
it
is
a
procedural
cast
that
the
court
has
given
to
the
concept
of
time,
place,
and
manner.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
i
always
wondered
where
that
came
from,
and
now,
with
further
study,
i
understand
that.
but
how
do
we
know
that
it's
a
qualification
as
opposed
to
a
manner?
justice
souter,
you
asked
that
question.
i
think
justice
o'connor
also
asked
the
question,
and
i
think
the
answer
lies
in
the
fact
that
storer
v.
brown
was
focused
on
one
election
cycle.
that
is,
the
burdens
that
were
imposed
upon
the
would-be
candidates
in
storer
v.
brown
were
based
upon
their
failure
during
the
election
cycle
to
do
the
types
of
things
that
california
law
required.
our
view
is
that
any
burden
placed
on
a
candidate
for
congress
based
upon
conduct
that
has
not
occurred
during
the
election
cycle
in
question
is
a
qualification.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
if
congress
can
rely
only
upon
the
textual
qualifications,
then
they
cannot
exclude
him.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
agree
with
you,
justice,
souter--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that
there
would
be
no--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--there
would
be
no
point
of
reference.
congress,
a
house
of
congress,
could
not,
under
article
i,
section
5,
do
very
much
at
all.
it
certainly
could
try,
but
i
agree
with
you
that
they
would
have
no
standard--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--justice
scalia,
i--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
i
do
argue
that--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--it
doesn't
really
make
any
difference,
justice
scalia--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--because...
because--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--all
right,
fine.
[laughter]
whatever
that
unidentified
flying
object
is
that's
neither
a
qualification
nor
a
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction
is
unconstitutional,
because
states
cannot
derive
from
the
constitution
the
power
to
impose
whatever
we
want
to
call
it.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
would
agree
with
my
cocounsel--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--justice
stevens,
i
think
this
court
has
made
very
clear
that
the
tenth
amendment
restates
divisions
of
authority
that
are
provided
elsewhere
in
the
constitution,
and
the
very
idea
that
the
tenth
amendment
could
give
the
states
the
power
somehow
to
fill
in
the
gaps
with
respect
to
the
federal
structure
when
we're
talking
about
provisions
that
do
not
grant
congress
explicitly
the
power
to
address
them,
or
deny
to
the
states
explicit
power
to
deal
with
them,
that
somehow
the
tenth
amendment
provides
that
power.
i
think
if
anything
the
tenth
amendment
is
reinforced
by
the
times,
places,
and
manner
provision.
that
might
be
viewed
as
something
that
the
tenth
amendment
reinforces,
or
vice
versa,
but
i
don't
see
how
the
tenth
amendment
could
come
into
place
under
these
circumstances.
it
is
truly
an
anomalous
reading
of
the
tenth
amendment
and
this
court's
jurisprudence.
i
wanted
to
touch
upon--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
as
i
indicated,
justice
breyer,
i
think--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
there's
a
temporal
quality
here.
the
requirement
with
respect
to
being
a
member
of
the
party,
or
if
you
wanted
to
run
as
an
independent,
not
being
a
member
of
a
party,
is
related
to
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process,
and
it
focuses
on
that
election
cycle.
the
people
who
were
disqualified
in
storer
can,
in
the
next
election
cycle,
prepare
themselves
to
qualify
according
to
the
rules
of
california.
under
amendment
73,
once
a
member
of
congress
has
served
three
terms
in
the
house
of
representatives
or
two
terms
in
the
senate,
there
is
nothing
that
that
person
can
do
to
conform
his
or
her
behavior.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it
would
not
be
different--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i'm
not.
you
asked
about
the
lifetime
disqualification.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it's
for
a
few
years,
or
a
lifetime
disqualification.
it
still--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
didn't
understand
myself
to
be
responding
in
that
fashion.
i--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes,
exactly.
exactly
so.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
that--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
right.
i
mean,
the
requirements,
what
obviously
you
want
to
file
under
those
circumstances,
are
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
criteria,
so
i
was
not
suggesting
that
they
would
fly
under
those
circumstances.
i
just
wanted
to
address
a
couple
of
other
points
that
were
raised
during
the
argument,
and
that
is
that
justice
scalia,
you
talked
about
the
disqualification
clause.
this
court
in
powell
canvassed
the
history
of
that
particular
formulation
and
locution,
and
i
think
what
the
court
concluded
was,
it
was
done
by
the
committee
of
style,
and
the
committee
of
style
had
no
authority
to
change
the
substance,
and
indeed,
during
that
period
it
was
quite
often
the
case
that
alternative
formulations
were
used
that
had
no
substantive
significance.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i'm
sure
some
of
them
did.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
they
were
a
very
learned
bunch.
[laughter]
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
certainly--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
he's
a
fairly
credible
source--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--mr.
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
we
could
do
worse,
i
think,
justice
souter,
was
your
point.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
you
asked
about
residency
requirements,
and
justice
scalia,
you
asked
about
various
limitations.
there
have
been
some
recent
decisions,
one
in
1968,
exon
v.
xx
in
the
district
of
nebraska,
where
residency
requirements
were
struck
down.
this
was
also
the
case
in
chavez
v.
evans
in
1968
in
new
mexico,
where
the
courts
concluded
that
states
did
not
have
the
power
to
impose
those
types
of
restrictions.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
other
members
of
the
court,
amendment
73
is
unconstitutional.
it
is
not
a
qualification
in
the
sense
that
if
it
is
a
qualification
it
violates
the
constitution,
and
it
does
not
fit
into
the
time,
place,
or
manner
powers
granted
to
states
under
the
constitution.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
what
arkansas
is
done
here
can
be
done
not
only
by
other
states
but
by
congress,
we
have
closed
the
door
that
madison
had
in
mind
that
would
be
open
to
merit
of
every
description
with
respect
to
service
in
the
united
states
congress.
we
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
thank
you
very
much.
