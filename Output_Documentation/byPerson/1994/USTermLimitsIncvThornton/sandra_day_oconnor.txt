justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
general
bryant,
a
good
many
states
have
passed
so-called
term
limit
measures
that
just
disable
a
candidate
from
appearing
on
the
ballot
for
a
short
period
of
time,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
arkansas
has
a
very
different
provision
in
that
it
extends
for
the
rest
of
that
particular
candidate's
life.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
there
may
well
be,
even
if
you
are
correct
that
it
is
seen
as
a
ballot
access
measure,
that
there
may
be
first
amendment
issues
at
stake
here,
the
associational
rights,
for
instance,
of
the
political
party
that
might
want
to
have
the
candidate
on
the
ballot
as
its
candidate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
are
those
issues
issues
that
were
resolved
in
the
courts
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
would
be
open
on
remand,
i
assume,
even
if
we
agreed
with
you
it
were
a
ballot
access
measure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
what
about
a
state
like
hawaii
that
has
no
write-in
voting
allowed
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
it
become
a
qualification
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
general
bryant,
this
is
a
very
remarkable
proposition--
[laughter]
--and...
does
your
argument
depend
in
any
way
on
this
most
unusual
interpretation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kester,
do
you
adopt
the
same
argument
as
your
predecessor
here
about
everything
is
either
a
qualification
or
a
time,
place,
and
manner?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
kester,
let
me
ask
you
this,
do
you
this
congress
has
the
power
under
article
i,
section
4,
to
adopt
precisely
the
kind
of
law
that
arkansas
has
applicable
to
all
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
cohen,
we
have
storer,
for
example,
which
certainly
prevented
a
candidate
from
appearing
on
a
ballot
at
least
for
a
period
of
time.
we
did
not
treat
that
as
a
qualification,
did
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
in
theory
this
provision
may
not
be
a
qualification
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cohen,
what
about
a
law
that
just
prohibits
ballot
access
for
one
election,
for
example?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
make
exactly
the
same
argument?
do
you
make
no
distinction
between
such
a
law
and
the
one
here?
that
is,
a
lifetime
inability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
a
line
you
end
up
with
in
examining
storer
and
knowing
what
is
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation
and
what
isn't.
it's
difficult
for
me
to
draw
a
clear
line
from
what
you
say.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
would
your
answer
be
different,
then,
in
a
state
which
has
just
adopted
a
one-time
interruption
of
the
ballot
access,
as
some
have?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
didn't
think
you
were
relying
on
that
distinction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
you
were
just
arguing
in
response
to
justice
scalia.
