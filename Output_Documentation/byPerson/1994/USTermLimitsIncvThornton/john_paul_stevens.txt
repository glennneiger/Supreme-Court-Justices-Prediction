justice
john
paul
stevens
which
category
would
a
law
providing
that
you
only
count
half
the
votes
of
a
candidate
fall?
would
that
be
a
qualification
or
a
time,
place
and
manner?
[laughter]
or
maybe
something
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
time,
place,
and
manner?
which
of
the
three?
is
it
time,
place,
or
manner?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
manner,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
bryant--
--well,
why--
--the
congress
can't
impose
any
qualifications,
can
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
source
for
that?
where
do
you
find
the
authority
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
doesn't
talk
about
qualifications.
that
talks
about
time,
place,
and
manner.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
congress
could
pass
a
statute
saying
every
senator
must
be
at
least
50
years
old?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
your
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
theory?
i
understand
you're
saying,
if
it's
a
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation
adopted
by
the
state,
the
congress
can
modify
it.
now,
supposing
it's
a
qualification.
there
are
two
ways
we
can
look
at
the
arkansas
law,
and
assume
they
take
it
to
be
a
qualification
rather
than
a
ballot
access
matter,
could
congress
amend
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
you're
adopting
the
attorney
general's
position
that
a
manner
includes
a
qualification.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
includes
qualifications?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
doesn't
have
to.
one
can
say
qualifications
are
things
like
being
over
50,
and
manner
things
like
where
you
hold
your
elections
and
the
like.
one
doesn't
have
to
say
that,
but
i
can
understand
that.
but
that's
your
view
of
the
word
manner.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
it
violate
those
other
provisions?
perfectly
reasonable
to
change
the
age
from
35
to
40,
45.
why
would
that
violate
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
the
constitutional
provision
is
invalid,
the
35-year
thing
is
irrational
under
your
approach.
i
don't
understand
why
40
is
any
more
irrational
than
35.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
not
under
the
qualifications
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it's
just
merely
what
i
thought
was
your
basic
position,
that
the
state
has
every
right
to
impose
additional
qualifications
if
it
wants
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
don't
know
why
40
years
is
any
different
than
being
an
incumbent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
any
reasonable
qualification.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
have
to
say,
i
don't
see
why
the
40-year
thing
would
violate
the
fourteenth
or
fifth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
the
analysis
takes
you
to
the
conclusion
it
does
not
violate
the
fourteenth,
then
you'd
have
to
face
up
to
the
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--whether
they
can
have
an
additional
qualification,
which
is
what
i
thought
this
case
was
all
about,
but
you
seem
to
say
they
cannot
have
certain
additional
qualifications.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
40
contradictory
to
35?
it
just
supplements
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--are
you
abandoning
the
position
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court
that
it
was
a
qualification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
or
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that
was
part
of
the
rationale
of
their
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
conceding
that
this
is
not
a
qualification
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
are
you
conceding
that
it's
not
a
qualification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
rather
major
concession.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
make
that
argument,
what
do
you
do
about
the
tenth
amendment,
with
these--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
doesn't
the
tenth
amendment
preserve
the
right
of
the
states
to
use
all
the
flying
objects
it
wants?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
bryant,
before
you
start,
how
many
terms
did
senator
mclellan
serve?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
1992,
the
voters
of
arkansas
passed
a
state
constitutional
amendment
that
according
to
its
preamble
was
intended
to
limit
the
terms
of
the
elected
officials.
the
arkansas
amendment
provides
a
candidate
for
the
united
states
house
of
representatives
who
has
served
in
congress
for
three
or
more
terms
is
ineligible
to
have
his
or
her
name
placed
on
the
ballot.
the
amendment
provides
a
similar
ballot
exclusion
for
united
states
senators
who
have
served
two
or
more
terms.
the
arkansas
supreme
court
held
that
the
amendment
violated
the
federal
constitution
and
we
granted
certiorari.
for
a
reason
stated
at
length
and
an
opinion
filed
with
the
court
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
sets
forth
the
qualifications
for
congress.
for
example,
it
states
no
person
shall
be
a
representative
who
shall
not
have
attained
to
the
age
of
25
years
and
been
seven
years
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
who
shall
not
when
elected
be
inhabitant
of
that
state
in
which
he
shall
be
chosen.
the
constitution
sets
forth
similar
qualifications
for
senators.
over
25
years
ago
in
a
case
called
powell
v.
mccormack
we
concluded
that
the
qualification
set
forth
in
the
text
of
the
constitution
were
exclusive
at
least
in
the
sense
that
congress
may
not
supplemented.
today’s
cases
present
a
different
question
that
that
presented
in
powell,
because
the
arkansas
amendment
was
passed
by
a
state
rather
than
congress.
we
are
convinced
however
that
the
states
as
well
as
the
congress
lack
the
power
to
add
to
the
qualification
set
forth
in
the
text
of
the
constitution.
as
james
madison
emphasized,
subject
to
those
limitation
the
door
of
this
part
of
the
federal
government
is
open
to
merit
of
every
description
whether
native
or
adoptive
whether
young
or
old,
and
without
regard
to
poverty
or
wealth,
or
to
any
particular
profession
of
religious
faith.
the
constitution
incorporates
the
framers
revolutionary
idea
that
sovereignty
is
vested
in
the
people.
the
framers
conceived
of
a
federal
government
directly
responsible
to
the
people,
possessed
of
direct
power
over
the
people,
and
chosen
directly,
not
by
states,
but
by
the
people.
permitting
individual
states
to
formulate
diverse
qualifications
for
their
representatives
could
result
in
a
patchwork
of
state
qualifications,
undermining
the
uniformity
and
the
national
character
that
the
framers
envisioned
and
sought
to
ensure.
petitioners
have
argued
however
that
even
the
states
cannot
add
qualifications;
the
arkansas
amendment
should
nevertheless
be
upheld,
because
it
is
only
a
ballot
access
provision
and
not
an
outright
disqualification.
we
reject
this
argument.
as
we
have
often
noted
constitutional
rights
would
be
of
little
value
if
they
could
be
indirectly
denied.
in
our
view
the
arkansas
amendment
is
in
attempt
to
accomplish
indirectly
what
the
constitution
prohibits
arkansas
from
accomplishing
directly.
as
it’s
evident
from
the
preamble
and
from
the
decision
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
the
unmistakable
purpose
of
the
arkansas
amendment
was
to
create
an
additional
qualification
for
servicing
congress.
a
state
constitutional
amendment
with
the
avowed
purpose
and
obvious
effect
of
evading
the
requirements
of
the
qualifications
clauses
cannot
stand.
the
merits
of
term
limits
have
been
the
subject
of
debate
since
the
formation
of
our
constitution,
when
the
framers
unanimously
rejected
a
proposal
to
add
such
limits
to
the
constitution.
the
cogent
arguments
on
both
sides
of
the
question
that
were
articulated
during
the
process
of
ratification
largely
retain
their
force
today.
over
half
the
states
have
adopted
measures
that
impose
such
limits
on
some
state
offices
either
directly
or
indirectly,
and
the
nation
as
a
whole,
notably
by
constitutional
amendment,
has
imposed
a
limit
on
the
number
of
terms
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
may
serve.
term
limits,
like
any
other
qualification
for
office,
unquestionably
restrict
the
ability
of
voters
to
vote
for
whom
they
wish.
on
the
other
hand,
such
limits
may
provide
for
the
infusion
of
fresh
ideas
and
new
perspectives,
and
may
decrease
the
likelihood
that
representatives
will
lose
touch
with
their
constituents.
and
as
judges,
it
is
not
our
province
to
resolve
this
longstanding
debate.
we
are,
however,
firmly
convinced
that
allowing
the
several
states
to
adopt
term
limits
for
congressional
service
would
effect
a
fundamental
change
in
the
constitutional
framework.
any
such
change
must
come
not
by
legislation
adopted
either
by
congress
or
by
an
individual
state,
but
rather-as
have
other
important
changes
in
the
electoral
process
through
the
amendment
procedures
set
forth
in
article
v.
the
framers
decided
that
the
qualifications
for
servicing
congress
should
be
fixed
in
the
constitution
and
be
uniform
throughout
the
nation.
that
decision
reflects
the
framers'
understanding
that
members
of
congress
are
chosen
by
separate
constituencies,
but
that
they
become,
when
elected,
servants
of
the
people
of
the
united
states.
they
are
not
merely
delegates
appointed
by
separate,
sovereign
states;
they
occupy
offices
that
are
integral
and
essential
components
of
a
single
national
government.
in
the
absence
of
a
properly
passed
constitutional
amendment,
allowing
individual
states
to
craft
their
own
qualifications
for
congress
would
thus
erode
the
structure
envisioned
by
the
framers,
a
structure
that
was
designed,
in
the
words
of
the
preamble
to
our
constitution,
to
form
a
"more
perfect
union.”
