justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
fact,
that's
why
judge
roth
thought
you
were...
that
you
struck
out,
because
it
wasn't
done
by
the
board
of
directors,
isn't
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
did
she
come
out
in
the
end
ruling
against
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that...
isn't
that
critical
to
your
case?
to
what
extent
do
you
rely
on
the
government
agency,
one
of
the
agencies
intimately
involved,
the
irs,
having
precisely
the
understanding
that
you
have
about
the
meaning
of
this
provision,
that
it
addresses
multiemployer
plans
and
not
single
company
plans?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
this
company
do
any
more
thinking
about
it
than
simply
copy
the
prototype
plan
that
irs
put
out
in
that
respect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
clause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
sure--
--how
could
her
view
be
otherwise,
though,
if
she
supported
the
judgment
of
the
court?
she
concurred
in
the
court's
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
she
have
made
that
conclusion
on
this
record?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
district
court
hadn't
made
any
finding
on
it,
and
it
would
be
extraordinary
for
a
court
of
appeals
judge
to
do
that
in
the
first
instance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
it
was
to
provide
clarity
for
the
plan
administrator
in
these
multiemployer
situations,
rather
than
to
protect
beneficiaries?
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--any
circumstance
about
where
there
might
be
ambiguity
for
the
plan
administrator,
but
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--has
the
irs
modified
its
prototype
plan
in
response
to
the
third
circuit's
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
did
put
in
a
provision
that
coincides
with
the
prototype
plan
put
out
by
the
irs
as
a
model,
and
it's
a
little
hard
then
to
come
down
on
a
company
for
following
a
form
or
coming
up
with
a
form
that
coincides
with
a
form
that
a
government
agency
puts
out
as
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
just
back
up
for
one
moment?
you
used
the
word
"casual",
and
i
was
looking
at
the
page...
the
district
court
didn't
say
casual,
unless
i'm
looking
at
the
wrong
place.
he
said,
routine--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
i
suppose
that's
the
argument
that
a
corporate
acts...
if
this
action
was
done
in
the
routine
way
that
corporate
actions
are
taken,
it
should
be
okay.
at
least
that
was
your
opponent's
argument,
that
a
corporation
is
a
person,
and
a
corporation
acts
in
this
instance
in
the
routine
way
that
a
corporation
acts
in
instances
generally,
so
i
don't
see
anything
negative
in
the
district
judge's
use
of
the
word
"routine".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
district
said
it
was
invalid
because
there
was
no
clause
that
provided
for...
you
prevailed
on
your
statutory
argument,
but
as
far
as
what
the
corporation
did,
i
don't
get
anything
from
this
page
saying
it
was
casual.
it
was
just
done
as
a
matter
of
routine,
not
done
pursuant
to
a
provision
that
says,
this
is
the
person
who
has
authority
to
amend,
this
is
the
procedure
for
amending.
i
thought
that
was
your
argument,
that
in
order
to
make
an
amendment,
you
must
have
a
plan
procedure
for
both
identifying
the
person
who
amends,
and
the
procedure
for
amending.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
not
done
that
way.
instead,
it
was
done
in
the
routine
way
that
a
corporation
acts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kennedy,
are
you
saying--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
you
saying
that
every
change,
at
least
every
change
that
doesn't
favor
the
plan
beneficiaries,
that
would
ever
be
made
in
any
plan
that
followed
the
irs
prototype
on
the
amendment
clause,
that
all
of
those
changes
would
be
no
good,
and
so
to
know
what
the
plan
contained,
you'd
have
to
go
back
to
the
very
first
plan
document,
which
would
not
be
what
the
beneficiaries
get
routinely?
is
that
the
effect
of
your
argument,
that
any
change
made
that
is
not
favorable
to
the
beneficiaries
from
day
one,
is
no
good?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
every
change
that
is
made
that
isn't
favorable
to
the
beneficiary
is
no
good?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
how
many...
thinking
of
this
plan,
how
many
changes
have
been
made
since
it
was
installed
that
didn't
favor
beneficiaries--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
would
be
no
good?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
would
not
be
the
only
one.
in
fact,
nobody
would
know
what
the
current
plan
is,
because
you'd
have
to
go
back
and
check
every
change
and
then
cancel
out
all
the
ones
that
were
detrimental.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
beneficiary
to
know
what
the
plan
contains?
they
get
these
summary
statements
that
says,
this
is
your
plan.
now,
under
your
interpretation,
they
don't
have
any
clue
what
their
plan
is,
because
there
are
a
lot
of
things
in
it
now
that
are
no
good.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
the
risk
much
larger
that
when
you
have
an
interpretation,
even
if
not
a
government
agency
that
we
would
defer
to
has
put
out
a
plan
to
the
public,
that
the
likelihood
is
that
many
people
have
adopted
plans
with
that
provision
in
it,
so
we
would
have
a
whole...
not
only
this
company's
plan,
but
a
whole
set
of
plans
where
the
beneficiaries
would
have
no
idea
at
the
moment
of
what
their
plan
contained?
