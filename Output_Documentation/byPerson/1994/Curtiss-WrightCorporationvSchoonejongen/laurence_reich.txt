mr.
laurence
reich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
effect
of
section
402(b)(3)
of
erisa
on
a
plan
term
included
in
a
governing
plan
document,
a
summary
plan
description,
issued
by
a
plan
sponsor
that
had
reserved
the
right
to
modify,
amend,
or
terminate
the
plan
from
its
inception
as
an
erisa
plan.
it
does
not
concern
the
right
of
the
plan
sponsor
to
terminate
company-paid
retiree
medical
benefits,
which
the
lower
courts
agreed
it
has.
section
402(b)(3)
provides
simply
that
every
employee
benefit
plan
shall
provide
a
procedure
for
amending
such
plan
and
for
identifying
the
persons
who
have
authority
to
amend
the
plan.
in
considering
the
requirements
of
section
402(b)(3),
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
erisa
applies
to
a
variety
of
employee
benefit
plans.
initially,
there
is
the
dichotomy
between
pension
plans
and
welfare
plans.
pension
plans
are
subject
to
a
panoply
of
regulations
in
part
1
of
erisa
that
do
not
affect
welfare
plans
some
pension
plans
are
subject
to
substantive
regulation
under
title
4
of
erisa
that
affect
only
pension
plans
and
not
welfare
plans.
most
pension
plans
have
some
concern
with
internal
revenue
code
requirements
that
do
not
affect
welfare
plans.
in
each
category,
there
may
be
plans
that
have
trustees
involved
and
plans
that
do
not.
the
presence
of
a
trustee
obviously
impacts
upon
the
need
for...
upon
the
procedure
for
amendment,
since
a
trustee
may
require
that
amendments
be
made...
affecting
it
be
made
only
with
its
consent.
some
plans
are
adopted
unilaterally
by
a
plan
sponsor
as
a
voluntary
matter,
and
other
plans
are
adopted
under
the
provisions
of
a
binding
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
obviously
adds
a
layer
of
complexity
to
the
amendment
of
the
plan.
other
plans,
both
pension
and
welfare,
are
single
employer
plans,
and
some
multiemployer
plans.
in
many
cases,
multiemployer
plans,
and
even,
indeed,
single
employer
plans,
will
involve
regulations
under
section
302
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
the
curtiss-wright
plan
is
the
very
simplest
of
all
these
plans.
it
is
a
voluntary,
single
employer
plan
unilaterally
adopted
by
the
employer,
not...
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
involved.
there
is...
and
there
is
no
trustee,
and
as
a
welfare
plan
it
is
subject
to
no
substantive
regulation.
as
far
as
the
amendment...
requirements
for
amendment
procedure
of
section
402(b)(3)
are
concerned,
there
is
nothing
in
erisa
that
intends
that
a...
indicates
an
intent
that
a
corporate
plan
sponsor,
which,
of
course,
is
a
person
under
section
(3)(9)
of
erisa,
that
expressly
reserved
unto
itself
the
right
to
amend,
specify
which
of
its
agents
should
amend.
of
course,
a
corporate
plan
sponsor,
being
a
corporation
and
a
juridical
entity,
not
a...
a
legal
entity
rather
than
a
physical
entity,
can
only
act
through--
mr.
laurence
reich
--yes,
justice.
mr.
laurence
reich
in
many
cases,
there
might,
indeed,
be
a
need
for
a
procedure
for
identifying.
i
would
suggest
that,
since
the
end
result
that
is
obviously
intended
by
congress
is
that
there
be
an
identification,
if
the
situation
is
a
simple
one
such
as
here,
it
should
be
sufficient
to
identify
the
person.
there
should
not
need
to
be
a
procedure
merely
for
saying
that
the
plan
sponsor
will
set
forth
a
procedure
for
identifying
itself
as
a
plan
sponsor.
it
would
seem
superfluous
to
utter
those
words
as
an
incantation
when
the
purpose--
mr.
laurence
reich
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
the
word.
mr.
laurence
reich
i
would
think
it
would
be.
here
it
would
be
surplusage,
since
the
goal
of
identification
is
the
goal,
and
there
is
no
need
for
a
procedure
here.
in
most...
in
many
cases,
there
is
a
need.
for
example,
in
a
taft-hartley
plan
where
you
have
a
joint
union
and
employer
administration,
and
you
have
the
intervention,
as
i
say,
of
section
302.
mr.
laurence
reich
particularly
a
multi--
mr.
laurence
reich
--it
would
be
questionable.
you...
i
believe
you
could
state,
for
example,
as
302(b)(5)
does
provide
that,
that
it
will
be
the
trustees,
who
are
supposed
to
be
jointly
drawn
from
the
employers
who
are
involved
in
the
plan
and
the
union
that
is
involved
in
the
administration
of
the
plan.
it's
a
bipartite
board
of
trustees
in
that
situation.
mr.
laurence
reich
i
would,
sir.
mr.
laurence
reich
i
would,
justice
souter,
and
i
would
say
further
that
it
would
not
merely
be
the
board
of
directors,
since
a
corporation
may
act
by
whomever
the...
has
authority
within
the
corporation
for
so
acting.
mr.
laurence
reich
well,
judge
roth,
there's
a
distinction...
if
you
read
the
footnote,
there
is
a
distinction
between
what
judge
roth
said
in
the
footnote
and
what
was
derived
from
that.
judge
roth
said
the
board
of
directors,
or
whomever,
may
act
for
the
company.
i
would
not
quarrel
with
that
part
of
it.
the
majority...
and
perhaps
judge
roth.
it's
unclear
in
the
footnote--
mr.
laurence
reich
--it's
somewhat
inscrutable.
it's
not
totally
clear
from
the--
mr.
laurence
reich
--possibly,
but
the
footnote
says
that...
refers
because
it
wasn't
done
by
the
board
of
directors.
indeed,
authority
exists...
"authority
may
be
implied",
as
fletcher,
we
quote
in
the
brief,
states:
"authority
may
be
implied
by
the
position
of
the
individuals,
agents
of
the
corporation,
not....
"
mr.
laurence
reich
well,
there
is
one...
there
is
one
flaw,
and
perhaps
a
second
flaw,
but
one
immediate
flaw,
justice
souter,
in
that--
mr.
laurence
reich
--we
have
that
way
in
new
jersey,
sir.
mr.
laurence
reich
the
term
that
the
congress
used
was
(3)(9)
of
erisa
as
including
a
corporation.
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
intended,
when
it
used
a
word
that
included
"corporation",
to
require
that
there
be
an
identification
of
individuals
within
the
corporation
that
act
for
the
corporation.
mr.
laurence
reich
well,
that...
there
is
a
gloss
of
legislative
history
on
this
that
may
suggest,
justice
souter,
to
the
contrary,
because
when
you
witness
the
fact
that
the
predecessor
provision
of
this
in
h.r.
2
gave
the
plan
administrator
the
authority
in
certain
limited
situations
to
amend
the
plan,
and
this
took
that
and
simply
allowed
the
plan
to
provide
for
who
might
amend
the
plan.
and
i
would
suggest
that,
as
you
suggested
in
an
earlier
question,
that
the
identification
in
the
plan
of
the
plan
sponsor,
the
company,
as
the
person
with
the
authority
to
amend,
should
satisfy
the
procedure.
that
must
have
been...
may
have
been
justice
o'connor's
question,
but--
mr.
laurence
reich
--yes.
mr.
laurence
reich
yes,
but
the
administrator
could
have
been
the
company,
as
it
can
be
and
frequently
is,
under
erisa
as
enacted,
so
you
get
back
to
the...
it's
somewhat
circular,
because
you
get
back
to
the
fact
that
you
ask
the
company,
as
the
plan
administrator,
or
you
ask
the
company
as
the
plan
sponsor.
in
any
event,
it
is
the
company.
mr.
laurence
reich
well,
there
probably
could
be
a
variety...
well,
the
bylaws
wouldn't...
probably
not
be
there
anyway.
they
probably
could
be--
mr.
laurence
reich
--the
person
who
acts
for
the
administrator
is
designated
in
the
summary
plan
description,
and
that
person...
that
person
could
be
inquired
of
to...
as
to
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
amendment.
in
this
case,
i
would
suggest
that
there
was
no
need,
and
this
is
the
other
thing
that
i
alluded
to
in
response
to
your
earlier
question,
and
that
is
that
this...
this
is
not
some
disembodied
amendment
that
we
are
talking
about,
some
document
sitting
out
there.
this
was
a
term
that
was
incorporated
in
the
document,
the
sp...
summary
plan
description
that
the
district
court
found
to
be
a
governing
plan
document
and
that
the
plaintiffs
have
conceded
to
be
a...
one
of
the
two
governing
plan
documents,
the
other
being
the
plan
constitution
that
set
forth
the
procedure
for
amendment
by
naming
the
company
as
the
amending
authority.
mr.
laurence
reich
congress
did
say
that.
mr.
laurence
reich
i
think
it's
basically
the
outgrowth...
and
this
is
primarily
for--
mr.
laurence
reich
--yes,
of
course.
mr.
laurence
reich
that
is
correct.
mr.
laurence
reich
no,
i
should
retract
my
agreement.
it
is
not
necessarily
that
the
administrator
might
not
have
the
amendment.
it
is
that
the
amendment
under
part
1
of
title
i
of
erisa,
under
sections
102
and
104,
it
may...
particularly,
in
this
case,
104,
it
may
be
that
the
plan
participants
and
the
secretary
of
labor
would
not
have
the
amendment
for
a
period
of
time,
up
to
19
months.
mr.
laurence
reich
and
the
administrator
would,
particularly
where,
as
here,
the
administrator
and
the
plan
sponsor
are
one
and
the
same.
mr.
laurence
reich
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
whether
or
not
the
internal
revenue
service
not
being
the
agency
that
administers
title
i
of
erisa
as
opposed
to
title
ii
and
some
other
aspects
of
erisa,
it
is
that
understanding,
and
it
has
been
since
the
inception
of
erisa
a
clear
understanding
on
the
part
of--
mr.
laurence
reich
--well,
this
wasn't...
this
did
not
adopt
the
prototype
plan,
but
if
it
had--
mr.
laurence
reich
--well,
it
happens
to
virtually
coincide
with
the
prototype
plan.
one
did
not
come
from
the
other.
mr.
laurence
reich
that
might...
that
might
be
a
possibility,
but
i
would
suggest
that
in
any
event
that
does
not
reach
basically
the
second...
the
critical
issue
of
remedy,
whether
or
not,
assuming
arguendo
that
there
was
not
an
adequate
procedure,
whether
or
not
the
third
circuit...
whether
or
not
there
is
a
remedy
of
invalidation.
when
congress
wanted
to
make
a
condition
precedent
to
the
validity
of
an
amendment,
it
did
so
in
a
number
of
instances.
sections
204(g)
and
(h)
of
erisa,
section
304(b)
of
erisa,
section
4220
of
erisa...
there
were
a
number
of...
these
are
among...
there
were
a
number
of
instances
in
which
congress
expressly
made...
imposed
some
condition
on
validity.
there
is
simply
no
provision
in
the
six
carefully
crafted
provisions
of
section
502,
to
quote
justice
stevens
in
massachusetts
mutual
v.
russell,
that
suggest
that
invalidation
of
a
plan
provision
is
at
all
a
possible
remedy.
it
might...
there
might
conceivably
be
some
reason--
mr.
laurence
reich
--it
was
not...
it
was
not...
it
was
in...
there
was
a
provision
in
the
plan
description.
the
plan
description
was
the
governing
plan
document.
it
was
simply
a
term
that
was
included
in
this.
there
had
been
plan
descriptions
that...
summary
plan
descriptions
issued
on
other
occasions
whenever
there
was,
as
here,
a
change
in
the
insurance
carrier.
that
was
the
occasion.
this
was
not
some
disembodied
amendment.
mr.
laurence
reich
well,
it's
not
that
there
had
been
no
plan
amendment.
there
was
a
plan
amendment.
if
you're
saying
by
the
authority--
mr.
laurence
reich
--well,
it's
not
that
the
court
said
that
there
was
no
plan
amendment.
it's
the
court
said
that
there
was
no
plan
procedure.
it
conceded
there
was
a
plan...
a
plan
amendment,
but
because
the
plan...
the
plan
procedure
was
lacking--
