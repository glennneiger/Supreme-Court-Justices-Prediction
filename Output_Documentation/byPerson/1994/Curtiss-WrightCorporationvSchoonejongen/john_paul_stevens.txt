justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
in
following
up
on
your
adversary's...
the
government's
last
remark,
what
about
an
amendment
to
this
plan
which
created
a
procedure
for
making
amendments?
would
that
be
valid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
that
any...
say
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
plan
that
did
not
satisfy
erisa
completely,
and
no
amending
procedure,
they
could
make
amendments
to
cure
other
defects
in
the
plan,
i
take
it,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
they
didn't
realize
they...
say
this
case
hadn't
been
decided,
but
they
realized
they
didn't
have
the
proper
funding
provisions,
or
something
like
that,
or
their
benefits
didn't
comply
with
certain
things,
could
they
make
amendments
to
just
bring
the
plan
in
conformity
with
the
statute,
even
though
there's
no
amendment
procedure
in
the
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kennedy--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
lot
of
these
amendments
are
a
product
of
negotiation
between
the
union
and
the
company,
and
i
presume
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
doesn't
have
to
be
approved
by
the
board
of
directors
to
be
valid,
but
you'd
say
one
incidental
feature,
we're
going
to
raise
the
pensions
from
$90
a
month
to
$92.50,
that
would
have
to
be
approved
by
the
board
of
directors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
sometimes
do.
