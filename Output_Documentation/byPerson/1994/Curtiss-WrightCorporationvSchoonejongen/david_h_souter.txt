justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
reich,
would
you
accept
the
proposition
that
the...
or
the
position
that
in
fact
there
is
a
procedure
in
your
plan
for
identifying
the
persons
with
authority,
and
that
procedure
is
implicit
in
your
designation
as...
of
the
company
as,
in
fact,
the
entity
that
can
amend?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
that
carries
the
implication
that
the
company
could
amend
through
the
action
or
authority
of
its
board
of
directors,
so
that
you
in
fact
satisfy
the
procedure-identification
criterion
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
suggest
this
as
a
hypothesis?
i
mean,
don't
you
think
she
was
assuming
that
the
company
would
act
either
through
individual...
either
through
the
board,
or
by
individuals
designated
by
the
board
through
a
resolution
which
would
be
in
the
corporate
records,
or
by
individuals
designated
by
the
board
through
a
resolution
which
would
be
in
the
corporate
records,
or
by
individuals
designated
in
the
bylaws,
and
apparently
there
was
no
indication
in
the
record
that
this
action
had
been
taken
by
anyone
in
either
of
those
three
categories,
and
isn't
that
why
she
held
against
you
on
the
facts?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
does
as
a
matter
of
general
corporation
law,
but
isn't
there
a
problem
in
this
statute
in
relying
upon
that
kind
of
identification,
because
at
least
it
seems
to
me
a
likely
reading
of
subsection
(3)
that
by
requiring
a
procedure
for
identifying
the
persons
with
authority,
what
congress
is
trying
to
get
at
is,
is
to
provide
a
means
by
which
somebody
who
wants
to
know
what
the
current
status
of
the
plan
is
can
determine
who
to
ask
and,
therefore,
unless
there
is
in
effect
something
of
record
somewhere
showing
who
might
be
amending
this,
that
it
would
not
satisfy
the
provisions
of
subsection
(3),
even
though,
under
general
corporation
law,
an
undesignated
individual
might
have
authority
to
do
something.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
compliment
you
on
the
way
you
pronounce
"flaw"?
i
didn't
do
quite
so
well
earlier
this
morning.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'll
grant
you
that,
but
isn't
it
also
the
case
that
if
congress
did
not
want
some
means
of
identifying
institutionally
who
could
take
the
action,
then
congress
wouldn't
have
bothered
to
be
talking
generally
about
identifying
individuals.
they
simply
would
have
said
the
plan
must
designate
those
persons
who
can
amend.
but
by
saying
the
plan
must
provide
a
procedure
for
identifying,
it
seems
to
carry
the
further
implication
that
somebody
who
wants
to
know
something
should
be
able
to
know
who
to
ask.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
under
the
earlier
scheme,
anybody
who
wanted
to
know
if
there
had
been
an
unpublished
amendment
would
know
enough
to
ask...
what
was
it,
the
administrator,
i
guess
you
said?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes...
would
know
enough
to
ask
the
administrator
in
order
to
make
sure
there
wasn't
something
not
on
the
record.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
take
your
theory.
let's
assume
i
am
someone
who
wants
to
know...
i
am
the
beneficiary,
and
i
want
to
know
what
the
present
state
of
the
plan
is.
on
your
theory,
whom
do
i
ask?
do
i
go
to
the
corporate
secretary
and
say,
can
you
tell
me
whether
there
is
anyone
who,
under
the
corporation
law
of,
what,
delaware,
in
this
case,
i
guess,
could
be
amending
this
plan
without
being
designated
by
a
vote
of
the
directors,
or
by
some
reference
in
the
bylaws?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
in
that
case,
how
would
i
find
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
step
back,
if
i
may.
if
congress
didn't
want
to
provide
for
anything
more
elaborate
than
the
capacity
of
an
inquirer
like
me
to
go
to
the
administrator
of
the
plan
and
say,
what
does
it
provide
right
now,
why
would
it
have
enacted
anything
as
elaborate
as
requiring
an
identification
for
a
procedure
for
those
with
authority
to
amend?
why
wouldn't
congress
simply
have
said,
the
administrator
must
be
available
to
answer
questions
about
the
current
state
of
the
plan,
or
the
administrator
must
have
a
copy
of
the
current
state
of
the
plan
at
all
times?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
did
it
say
this,
too?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i...
i'm
sorry.
may
i
interrupt
you
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--ask
one
question
before
i
lose
it?
isn't
it
the
case
that
there
could
be
an
amendment
that
is
not
recorded
with
or
filed
with
the
administrator
for
some
period
of
time,
i
forget
what
it
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
if
you
went
to
the
administrator
and
said,
let
me
see
what
you've
got,
technically
the
administrator
might
not
have
every
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
administrator
would.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bress,
on
your
view,
why
did
the
statute
refer
to
procedures
for
identifying
those
with
authority,
as
opposed
simply
to
requiring
procedures
for
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean,
it
will
not
be
clear
as
a
matter
of
corporation
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
would
then
know
enough
to
go
to
someone
who
speaks
for
the
sponsoring
organization
and
say,
did
you
make
any
changes?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
if
you
know
who
the
sponsoring
organization
is,
i
suppose
you
can
go
to
its
president
or
its
secretary,
or
somebody
who
keeps
its
records,
and
say,
did
you
make
any
changes
with
respect
to
this
plan.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
the
reason
for
referring
to
identification?
isn't
there
an
interest
in
providing
some
means
by
which
someone...
by
which
a
beneficiary
can
find
out
what
his
benefits
are
at
any
given
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
yet
even
on
your
own
reading,
that
would
not
be
required.
i
mean,
as
justice
scalia
said
in
his
hypo,
if
there
is
a
clear
designation
of
the
youngest
attorney
in
the
department
as
the
individual
to
make
the
amendment,
i
presume
that
on
your
own
reading
of
subsection
(3),
that
would
be
satisfactory.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
how,
then...
why,
then,
do
you
argue
that
somehow
as
a
matter
of
law,
of
federal
law,
we
should
read
a
corporate
governance
requirement
into
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
source
of
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
a
moment
ago
you
agreed
that,
in
fact,
if
the
procedure
had
specified
that
the
junior
counsel
in
the
corporation
could
amend
the
plan,
that
would
be
valid.
