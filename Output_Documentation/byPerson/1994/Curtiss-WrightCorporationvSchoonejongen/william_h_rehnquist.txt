hear
argument
next
in

corporation
v.

mr.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bress.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kennedy,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
use
the
phrase,
casual
redrafting,
mr.
kennedy.
what
officials
participated
in
the
redrafting,
which
you
say
was
casual?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
was
the
district
court
thinking
about,
do
you
think--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--since
i
wasn't
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
kennedy,
what
if
the
effect
of...
on
your
clients
of
this
casually
drafted...
had
been
exactly
the
opposite.
what
if
it
has
given
them
some
very
substantial
benefit,
but
upon
examination
it
turned
out
that
it
was
just
done
by
a
couple
of
inexperienced
lawyers
in
the
general
counsel's
office,
would
that
make
the
amendment
which
benefited
them
equally
invalid?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't...
didn't
the
evidence
show
that
the
amendment
was
drafted
by
the
corporate
director
of
benefits
and
labor
counsel
and
then
approved
by
the
executive
vice
president?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
district
court
make
any
finding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
did
not?
the
district
court
didn't
think
it
necessary
to
make
a
finding
on
that
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
it
you
say
that
only
the
corporate
board
could
adopt
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
that
be?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
building
a
great
deal
on
the
requirement
of
a
procedure,
that
state
corporation
law
be
totally
superseded.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
this
plan
had
said,
the
company
pursuant
to
new
jersey
corporate
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
kennedy.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
number
93-1935,
curtiss-wright
corporation
against
versus
schoonejonge
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
