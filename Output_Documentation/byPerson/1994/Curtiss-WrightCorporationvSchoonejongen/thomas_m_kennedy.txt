mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
take
this
court
briefly
through
the
process
of
how
we
got
here,
both
to
assist
you
in
answering
your
questions,
and
to
help
frame
the
statutory
issues
posed.
this
plan
had
its
origin
in
a
pre-erisa
retiree
benefit
plan
maintained
by
curtiss-wright
corporation
for
its
nonunion
retirees.
in
1976,
at
the
time
erisa
was
adopted,
the
plan
created
two
documents,
a
trust
and
a
plan
constitution.
that
trust
appears
at
joint
appendix
23
of
the
record,
the
constitution
at
joint
appendix
34.
the
record
reflects
formal
acts
taken
to
effectuate
both
of
those
documents.
at
joint
appendix
33,
the
trust
agreement
was
executed
by
a
corporate
vice
president,
it
was
dated,
and
the
signature
was
attested
by
the
secretary
of
the
corporation.
similarly,
6
months
later
when
the
plan
constitution
was
adopted
to
comply
with
erisa,
the
record
reflects
at
joint
appendix
40
an
execution
by
a
corporate
vice
president,
a
dating,
and
an
attestation
by
the
corporate
secretary.
seven
years
later,
when
this
corporation
acted
to
deprive
the
plaintiff
class
of
their
benefits,
nothing
like
that
type
of
procedure
was
followed.
instead,
through
an
act
of
casual
redrafting...
and
we
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
particularly
at
page
38
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition...
there
were
no
formal
procedures
followed
in
any
respect
in
connection
with
the
adoption
of
the
term
under
which
these
benefits
were
denied.
the
court
went
further
and
found
no
informal
procedures
were
followed
either.
instead,
an
act
of
casual
redrafting
had
the
effect
of
denying
petitioners
the
benefits
which
they
had
been
led
to
believe
would
be
theirs
for
their
lives.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
the
term
"casual"
is
taken
from
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
the
district
court--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--the
district
court,
your
honor,
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
at
trial
the
company
representatives
testified
to
a
3-year
process
in
which
drafts
of
a
proposed
summary
plan
description
were
reviewed
at
various
points
by
various
officials
and
there
was
not
even...
they
were
not
even
able
to
establish
at
the
trial
who
had
been
responsible
for
initiating
the
particular
language
which
resulted
in
the
deprivation
of
these
benefits.
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
process
more
lacking
in
any
procedural
basis
than
what
was
gone
through
in
this
instance
to
deprive
the
plaintiffs
of
these
fundamental
benefits.
an
attorney
in
the
company
legal
department,
one
of
their
personnel
managers,
both
testified
that
they
had
been
responsible
for
inserting
this
language
into
galley
sheets
that
came
back
from
the
printers
in
connection
with
the--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--the
grievance,
your
honor,
is
that
the
lack
of
a
procedure
meant
that
the
individuals
who
inserted
this
language
into
this
plan
never
recognized
or
were
aware
that
an
effective
amendment
was
being
made.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
we
have
several
problems
with
that
approach,
your
honor.
in
our
view,
it
ought
to
be
a
federal
question
under
402(b)(3)
of
the
act
of
when
sufficiently
solemn
steps
have
been
taken
to
effectuate
a
change
in
an
employee
benefit
plan.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
yes,
it
would,
and--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--because
if
we
are
reading
a
corporate
governance
requirement,
it's
stemming
from
a
legal
default
by
curtiss-white
corporation
as
plan
sponsor.
they
did
not
act
to
make
the
youngest
attorney
in
the
legal
office
the
individual
empowered
to
create
amendments.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
well,
even
hall
of
famers
strike
out
occasionally,
your
honor,
and
in
this
case,
the
internal
revenue
service
does
not
appear
to
have
followed
either
the
language
or
what
we
regard
as
the
expressed
intent
of
congress,
and
we
think
it's
significant
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
no
special
regulatory
authority
for
issues
arising
under
title
i
of
erisa.
that
is
under
the
department
of
labor.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
the
amendment
would
be
invalid
as
an
effective
reordering
of
plan
terms.
now,
going
one
step
further,
to
the
extent
a
plan
sponsor
were
to
issue
to
employees
representations
that
there
had
been
an
increase
in
benefits,
there
might
well
be
reliance
interest
by
the
recipients
of
those
promises
that
would
allow
them
to
be
enforced,
but
not
as
an
amendment
to
the
plan,
but
under
more
equitable
doctrines
which
would
entitle,
on
theories
of
detrimental
reliance,
plan
participants
to
enforce
terms
under
those
circumstances.
it
would
not,
however,
be
an
effective
amendment
of
the
plan.
we
recognize
that
this
is
a
two-edged
sword,
and
that
congress
intended,
from
our
perspective,
in
the
curious
wording
of
this
particular
statute,
to
accomplish
two
very
important
goals.
the
first
is
a
gatekeeper
function,
and
this
particular
section
has
two
parts
of
it.
the
first
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
procedure
for
amending
such
plan.
now,
in
our
view,
that,
as
we
said,
is
a
gatekeeper.
it
allows
anyone
to
determine
when
the
plan
has
been
effectively
amended,
and
we
would
direct
you
to
the
other
fiduciary
sections
of
erisa,
which
in
our
view
make
clear
that
only
an
effective
amendment
can,
in
fact,
be
enforced
by
a
plan
administrator.
402(a)(1),
as
an
example,
provides
that
a
plan
has
to
be
not
only
established,
but
maintained
pursuant
to
a
written
instrument.
to
be
maintained
pursuant
to
a
written
instrument,
it
has
to
be
amended
validly,
or
the
original
written
instrument
continues.
404(a)(1)(d)
provides
that
plan
administrators
are
to
enforce
the
written
terms
of
a
plan
only
insofar
as
they
are
consistent
with
the
terms
of
this
title.
an
amendment
which
has
not
been
adopted
pursuant
to
a
40(b)(3)
procedure
is
not
consistent
with
the
terms
of
this
title.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
it
would
for
this
reason,
your
honor,
and
we
recognize
it
sounds
anomalous
to
suggest
that
a
plan
cannot
be
amended,
but
yet
that
could
be
accomplished,
and
i'll
explain
to
you
our
reasoning,
and
what
we
believe
was
probably
the
third
circuit
reasoning.
everyone
in
this
case
acknowledges
that
one
of
the
possible
steps
that
a
participant
can
take
if
a
plan
lacks
an
amendment
procedure
is
to
go
to
court
and
obtain
an
order
under
502(a)(3)
compelling
the
sponsor
to
adopt
the
plan
amendment.
in
our
view,
a
plan
sponsor
has
an
inherent
right
to
bring
its
plan
into
compliance
with
the
express
terms
of
erisa.
that
would
not
extend
to
an
inherent
right
to
accomplish
amendments
that
are
in
its
own
financial
self-interest
and
are
not
directed
at
complying
with
erisa.
a
procedure
which...
or,
rather,
a
recognition
that
plan
sponsors
can
add
an
amendment
procedure
really
only
says
to
them
that
yes,
if
you
notice
you're
out
of
compliance
with
erisa,
there's
no
need
to
wait
till
a
participant
drags
you
into
court
and
compels
you
to
accomplish
that
which
you
should
have
done
originally,
at
the
time
the
plan
was
created.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
in
our
view
the
sensible
procedure
would
be
to
first
enact
the
amendment
procedure
and
then
accomplish
the
other
goals
through
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
well,
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out,
your
honor,
other
courts
have
enforced
erisa
plans,
though
they
be
unwritten,
and
though
they
be
without
a
funding
procedure,
the
theory
being,
i
think,
twofold.
the
first
is
that
when
there
is
something
mandated
by
the
statute,
the
law
will
presume
it
to
be
there.
the
second,
that
these
types
of
situations
would
be
construed
in
favor
of
plan
participants
and
against
plan
sponsors.
so
my
answer
is
yes,
in
my
view,
a
plan
sponsor
could,
consistent
with
the
statute,
take
such
actions
as
are
necessary
to
bring
it
into
compliance
with
the
act,
which
would
not,
of
course,
authorize
the
amendment
which
took
place
in
this
case,
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
plan
qualification.
the
statute
provides...
we
find
this
interesting...
in
a
number
of
instances,
403(b)(2)
is
an
example,
404(d)(2)(a)
for
another--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--your
honor,
i
apologize.
you
are
right--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--your
honor,
the...
we
understood
it
to
be
negative,
and
i
apologize
to
the
court
if
i
substituted
a
word
which
you
regard
as
having
other
and
pejorative
consequences.
we
understood
by
"routine"
to
have
meant
"casual",
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
testimony
at
the
trial
that
there
was
an
informal
procedure
available
to
amend
the
plan,
and
even
that
was
not
followed,
so
that
this
was
not
a
situation
where
typical,
predictable,
expected,
established
corporate
routines
were
followed,
and
therefore
it
gave
the
amendment
legitimacy.
the
district
court
found
that
this
amendment
was
invalid,
and
not
subject
to
respect,
because
it
was
adopted
in
a
manner
which
was
not
consistent.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
your
honor,
we
were...
my
argument
was
based
on
the
following
sentence
in
the
district
court
opinion,
which
is
on
page
38-a:
"however,
the
court
has
also
considered
in
this
case
the
testimony
of
mr.
dubois,
who
was
a
company
personnel
manager,
which
suggests
that
there
may
have
been
an
unwritten
procedure
for
amending
the
plan
involving
the
submission
to
a
certain
executive
committee
which
he
described.
"
"however,
as
the
defendant
admits,
even
those
procedures
were
not
followed
in
the
case
of
the
1983
amendatory
language.
"
the
court
then
goes
on
to
hold
that
the
language
in
fact
was
added
through
routine
redrafting,
which
we
understood
to
have
been
a
comment
suggesting
the
lack
of
appropriate
procedure
under
which
this
language
was
added,
rather
than
a
suggestion
that
some
form
of
corporate
expected
behavior
had
occurred.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
the
record
certainly
shows
that
the
amendment
was
drafted
by
the
corporate
labor
counsel
and
the
manager
of
benefits.
there
is
a
disagreement
in
this
record
as
to
whether
the
record
effectively
shows
that
it
was
approved
by
the
executive
vice
president,
and--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
no.
he
pointed
out,
your
honor,
that
the
reference
to
the
executive
vice
president
was
the
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
de
facto
committee
which
met
on
these
things.
the
district
court
conclusion
was
that
there
had
been
no
de
facto
compliance
with
these
procedures.
the
informal
procedures
internal
to
the
company
had
not
been
followed.
that
was
the
district
court
view,
and--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--it
was
placed
into
the
summary
plan
description,
and
i'd
like
to
just
draw
a
distinction
between
the
plan
and
the
summary
plan
description.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
the
summary
plan
description
in
this
case,
at
joint
appendix
53
and
joint
appendix
55,
provides
that
in
the
event
of
conflict
between
the
plan
and
this
document
called
the
summary
plan
description,
the
plan
itself
will
control,
so
that
there
is
a
question
about
whether
inserting
the
language
within
the
summary
plan
description
actually
was
effective
to
accomplish
anything,
though
in
our
view,
our
participants
were
harmed
by
the
insertion
of
this
language
in
the
following
manner.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
but
your
honor,
on
theories
of
detrimental
reliance,
and
not
on
a
theory
that
had
accomplished
an
effective
plan
amendment--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--which
is
a
very
important
difference.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
in
our
view,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--if
the
plan
were
properly
amended
to
set
forth
this
term,
then
we
would
not
be
here,
so
it's
difficult
to
speculate
as
to
what
harm
there
would
be.
this
is
a
question
about
whether
the
amendment
was
effectively
adopted.
the
lack
of
a
procedure
caused
a
separate
cognizable
harm
to
my
clients
in
the
following
respect.
they
were
deprived
of
their
right,
anticipated,
in
our
view,
by
congress,
to
have
the
decision
on
these
critical
benefits
made
by
an
informed
fiduciary
aware
that
an
amendment
in
fact
was
occurring.
it's
significant
here--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--in
our
view,
the
source
of
that
right
is
the
requirement
that
a
specific
procedure
be
inserted
in
the
plan.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
even
were
that
true,
justice
souter,
the
junior
counsel
would
be,
then,
a
fiduciary.
if
it
were
up
to
him
or
her
to
make
such
an
amendment,
they
would
be
aware
that
an
amendment
in
fact
was
occurring,
and
they
might
recognize
the
decades
of
representations
made
to
the
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
that
they
would
receive
these
benefits
for
life.
that
decision,
to
make
an
affirmative
change
in
the
terms
of
the
plan,
rather,
to
enforce
what
the
corporation
may
have
improperly
understood
was
part
of
its
plan,
is
a
substantive
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
a
procedural
one,
yes--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--your
honor,
though
i
think
we
could
accept
a
de
minimis
rule
as
a
matter
of
judicial
common
sense,
any
substantive
plan
change
made,
to
be
effective
has
to
comply
with
the
stated
procedure
under
section
402(b)(3).
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
under
our
interpretation
of
402(b)(3),
that
is
correct.
under
the
interpretation
by
judge
roth--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--this
plan,
very
few,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
this
plan,
very
few.
we
are
not
aware
of
any.
this
was
a
hospitalization,
for
the
most
part,
plan,
providing
for
80
percent
reimburse--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--there
may
be
a
burden
on
a
plan
sponsor
from
the
ruling
we
advocate,
but
it
is
a
burden
placed
on
them
by
congress.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
your
honor,
let
me
remind
you
of
this.
every
party
to
this
appeal
recognizes
that
if
a
plan
has
a
stated
procedure,
and
it
is
not
followed
in
connection
with
the
adoption
of
an
amendment,
that
amendment
is
invalid,
and
even
if
it
appears
in
the
summary
plan
description,
does
not
work
an
effective
change
to
the
terms
of
the
plan.
if
that
is
true,
then
that
same
risk
of
uncertainty
is
present
whenever
a
plan
has
complied
with
congress
and
in
fact
adopted
a
procedure,
because
even
if
it
were
to
be
the
junior
person
in
the
corporate
law
department,
if
the
changes
were
being
made
by
the
executive
vice
president
to
the
corporation
not
securing
the--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--your
honor,
obviously
there's
a
risk
involved,
but
let
me
suggest
to
you
that
that
risk,
which
was
certainly
remarked
upon
by
the
petitioner
in
their
threat-of-litigation
argument,
is
ameliorated
by
a
number
of
factors.
the
first
is
that
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
here
which
would
prevent
participants
from
going
back
more
than
6
years
to
complain
of
amendments
supplied
to
them
that
had
not
been
properly
adopted.
within
that
6-year
period,
since
at
least
1990,
the
third
circuit
in
the
frank
and
hozier
cases
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
plans
that
persisted
in
adopting
amendments
not
pursuant
to
a
403(b)
procedure
were
at
risk
of
having
rendered
themselves
unamendable,
and
if
a
plan
sponsor
has
proceeded
to
continue
to
maintain
itself
out
of
compliance
with
erisa,
and
is
harmed
by
this,
it's
a
self-inflicted
wound
in
our
opinion.
there's
been
ample
notice
to
them
that
this
was
a
congressional
directive,
and
it
was
entitled
to
be
respected.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
yes,
in
our
view--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--there
is,
your
honor.
when
initially
adopted,
h.r.
2,
the
original
erisa
statute
that
passed
the
house
of
representatives,
provided
that
plan
administrators
shall
be
deemed
to
have
the
authority
to
amend
their
plans,
and
gave
no
indication
that
there
should
be
further
disclosure
either
to
participants
or
fiduciaries
as
to
how
that
should
be
done
or
who
should
do
it.
that
was
specifically
rejected
by
congress
when
it
did
adopt
the
current
provision
of
402(b)(3),
and
the
conference
report
that
accompanied
the
adoption
of
erisa,
though
it
is
brief,
states
clearly
that
every
employee
benefit
plan
shall
have
a
procedure
for
amending
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
well,
we
coupled
that,
your
honor,
with
the
requirement
set
forth
in
erisa
that
all
plan
documents
be
disclosed
upon
request
to
participants.
when
you
understand
that
congress
recognized,
in
drafting
these
fiduciary
requirements,
that
every
plan
document
was
subject
to
disclosure,
a
requirement
that
there
be
a
specific
procedure
in
our
view
is
consistent
with
that
disclosure
obligation,
and
as
the
third
circuit
held,
was
a
critical
term
to
allow
people
to
know
how
and
by
whom
settled
expectations
could
be
changed.
the...
i'd
like
to
address
the
distinction
between
procedural
defaults
which
arise
under
the
reporting
and
disclosure
sections
of
the
act
and
procedural
defaults
that
arise
under
fiduciary
sections.
a
number
of
courts
have
held
that
in
order
for
a
participant
to
obtain
benefits
in
a
situation
in
which
there
has
been
a
default
in
the
obligation
to
distribute
a
summary
plan
description
and
so
forth,
in
order
to
obtain
recovery,
the
participant
must
demonstrate
a
detrimental
reliance
upon
the
information
that
was
made
available
to
them.
in
our
view,
that's
inappropriate
when
the
default
was
not
a
reporting
and
disclosure
obligation
in
section
102,
but
a
far
more
fundamental
section
directly
within
the
fiduciary
sections
of
erisa.
the
requirement
that
plan
administrators
adhere
to
plan
terms
only
insofar
as
they
comply
with
erisa
in
our
view
suggests
that
a
plan
amendment
which
is
not
consistent
with
the
statute
cannot
be
enforced.
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
that
the
appropriate
response
this
court
should
make
to
the
third
circuit
decision
is
a
remand.
i'd
like
to
address
the
type
of
standards
that
ought
to
be
utilized
by
this
court
should
that
option
be
accepted.
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
difference
between
saying,
as
a
bright
line
rule,
that
in
order
for
a
plan
amendment
to
be
adopted,
if
there
is
no
procedure
set
forth
in
a
plan,
only
the
highest
body
in
the
corporation
can
undertake
that
amendment,
in
this
case
the
corporate
board
of
directors.
that
is
what
we
understand
judge
roth
to
have
been
deciding.
the
position
of
petitioner,
curtiss-wright,
would
allow
notions
of
corporate
law
which
go
well
beyond
that
to
be
utilized
by
this...
by
a
reviewing
court
in
determining
whether
there
had
been
some
type
of
adoption
by
the
corporation,
and
in
our--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--in
our
view,
state...
the
purpose
of
state
law
should
be
only
to
identify
the
highest
decisionmaking
authority
within
the
sponsoring
entity,
and
that
federal
law
should
determine
as
to
whether
that
entity
has
appropriately
made
an
effective
amendment.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
because
otherwise,
your
honor,
you
get
into
the
realm
of
postamendment
conduct
as
constituting
the
validation
process,
as
curtiss-wright
in
fact
has
argued
here.
they
suggest
in
their
brief
that
one
of
the
reasons
the
corporation
should
be
deemed
to
have
adopted
this
amendment
is
that
they
fought
it
in
court
for
7
years,
and
congress,
in
our
view
by
requiring
a
procedure,
was
clearly
focusing
on
pre--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--well,
your
honor,
the
definition
of
procedure,
after
all,
in
black's
law
dictionary,
is
the
mode
of
effectuating
a
legal
right,
as
opposed
to
the
legal
right
itself.
that
requirement
that
a
procedure
be
stated
in
our
view,
given
its
natural
reading,
does
require
that
the
plan
set
forth
the
mode
of
accomplishing
a
procedure
for
amendment.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
then,
your
honor,
in
our
view,
the
question
would
be
whether
the
amendment
had
been
valid
under
new
jersey
corporate
law,
but
the
fact
that
a
plan
sponsor
can
self-describe
that
form
of
legal
test,
which
is
what
congress
intended,
doesn't
mean
that
in
the
case
of
a
default
under
the
statute,
leaving
out
any
type
of
procedure,
this
court
should
extend
to
them
the
full
range
of
corporate
law
in
making
that
determination.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
in
a
situation
in
which
the
plan
specifically
provides
that
the
board
of
directors--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--if
there
were
express
action
of
the
board
of
directors
to
designate
an
amending
authority--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--in
our
view
it
would
be
within
judge
roth's--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--concurrence.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
in
our
view
that--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--in
our
view,
that
stretches
the
term
"procedure"
which
congress
required
be...
to
its
breaking
point,
and
reads
it
out
of
the
statute
to
the
point
where
all
a
plan
sponsor
need
do
is
to
state
whether--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--failure--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--your
honor,
i'm
a
union
lawyer,
and
i
know
full
well,
when
i
negotiate
a
contract
with
a
company,
that
that
change
to
that
pension
plan
hasn't
become
effective
until
the
plan
has
been
amended
to
set
forth
that
change,
even
if
we've
got
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
over
here
which
says
that
the
company's
going
to
do
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
unions
and
companies
don't
negotiate
the
terms
of
single
employer
plans.
at
least,
they--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--they
negotiate
about
those
terms,
but
the
effective
act
of
bringing
about
the
change
in
the
plan
to
reflect
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
an
amendment
of
the
plan
by
the
proper
amending
authorities,
which
would
not
include
the
union.
in
our
view,
this
statute
is
plainly
set
forth.
it
does
no
more
than
require
a
plan
sponsor
to
obey
the
terms
of
the
law
when
taking
away
critical
health
care
provisions
for
section...
sectors
of
our
population
that
are
least
able,
really,
to
respond
to
these
kinds
of
changes,
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
proper
benefit--
mr.
thomas
m.
kennedy
--thank
you.
