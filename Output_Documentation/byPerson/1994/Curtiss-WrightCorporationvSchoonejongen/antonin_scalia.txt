justice

scalia
it
rhymes
with
law...
law.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
you
have
any
grievance
for
all
of
that.
i
mean,
you
acknowledge
that
if
the
plan
said
an
amendment
may
be
made...
shall
be
made
by
the
company,
its
procedure
shall
be
it
will
be
drafted
by
an
attorney
in
the
counsel's
office,
by
the
youngest
attorney,
the
youngest
and
most
inexperienced
attorney
in
the
counsel's
office,
that
would
be
okay,
as
far
as
you're
concerned,
right?
that's
not
your
grievance.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
there's
no
effective
amendment,
but
that's
a
question
of
corporate
law.
i
mean,
is
that
your
argument,
that
the
corporation
has
not
effectively
acted,
and
therefore
there
is
no
amendment?
we
can
send
it
back
to
have
that...
in
fact,
that's
been
the
suggestion,
that
we
send
it
back
to
have
that
determined.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
harm
has
this
caused
you,
unless
it
be
the
harm
that
the
amendment
was
not
effectively
adopted
by
the
corporation?
let's
leave
that
question
aside.
perhaps
they
didn't
adopt
it
at
all,
but
assuming
it
was
adopted,
i
could
see
how
your
client
would
have
suffered
harm
if
the
amendment
was
not
incorporated
into
the
plan,
so
that
your
client
didn't
know
anything
about
it,
and
didn't
know
where
to
go
to
find
out
about
it,
but
in
fact
it
was
incorporated
into
the
plan,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
that
you
would
be
up
here
arguing
for
your
clients
that
if
something
had
been
inserted
into
that
summary
of
the
plan
and
in
fact
had
not
been
adopted
by
the
corporation,
the
corporation
would
nonetheless
be
bound
to
pony
up
that
particular
benefit?
don't
you
think
that
would
be
the
result?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whatever
the
difference
is,
if
that
detrimental
reliance
works
in
one
direction,
why
doesn't
it
work
in
the
other?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
no
harm,
no
foul.
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--assuming
it's
been
properly
adopted,
which
is
another
question.
we
can
send
it
back
to
find
that.
if
it
has
been
properly
adopted,
what
harm
has
been
done
to
your
clients?
it
was
there
in
the
summary
of
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
board
of
directors
of
the
corporation
had
adopted
a
resolution
which
says,
amendments
of
all
plans,
contracts,
and
other
documents
to
which
this
corporation
is
a
party
may
be
made
by
the
least
experienced,
youngest
lawyer
in
the
general
counsel's
office?
so
the
board
has
specified
that
this
is
the
way...
would
that
satisfy
you,
or
do
you
insist
that
this
is
nondelegable
by
the
board
of
directors?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
the
plan.
the
plan
just
says
what
this
plan
says,
and
you
say,
well,
only
the
board
of
directors
can
do
it.
well,
what
if
the
board
of
directors
has
adopted
a
provision
which
says,
all
amendments
can
be
made
by
the
general
counsel?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
now,
there
isn't
such
an
explicit
resolution
by
the
board
but,
in
fact,
from
time
immemorial
all
amendments
have
been
made,
with
the
knowledge
of
the
board,
by
the
general
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
not
suffice.
