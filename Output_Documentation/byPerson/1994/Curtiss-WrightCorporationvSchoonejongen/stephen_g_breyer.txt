at
the
moment,
i'm
thinking
that
your...
they're
arguing
that,
look,
this
just
means
you
have
to
have
a
procedure
and
you
have
to
know
who's
going
to
do
it,
and
so
the
company
says,
yes,
we
have
a
procedure.
we're
not
quite
certain
what
it
is.
i
mean,
it's
ambiguous
as
to
whether
it's
the
office
boy
or
the
president
of
the
board
of
trustees,
but
there
is
a
procedure,
and
the
company
can
do
it,
that's
who.
not
the
trustee,
not
the
beneficiaries,
but
the
company,
so
we've
complied.
you
get
more
out
of
this...
read
the
statute
stronger,
because
you're
reading
it
as
an
information
requirement,
whether
it's
to
give
the
trustee
information,
to
give
the
beneficiaries
information,
to
give
somebody
else.
now,
is
there
anything
in
the
history
of
it
or
the
position
of
this
that
suggests
it's
an
information
requirement
rather
than
just
trying
to
make
certain
there
is
some
kind
of
a
plan,
and
somebody
can
work
the
plan...
work
the
amendment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
maybe
they
perhaps
meant
that
it
needn't
necessarily
be
the
administrator
who
can
amend
it.
maybe
the
administrator
with
others.
maybe
the
beneficiaries.
maybe
the
workers.
maybe
altogether.
maybe
the
trustee.
is
there...
i
mean,
as
you
say
it,
it
doesn't
sound
like
they
want
information
to
be
given.
