mr.
richard
p.
bress
if
you
agree
with
the
government's
position
that
the
third
circuit
got
it
wrong
and
there
was,
in
fact,
a
procedure
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
the
correct
result
would
be
to
remand
back
to
the
third
circuit
to
determine
whether
the
company
acted
to
promulgate
the
amendment
in
this
case.
and
by
"the
company
acted",
what
i
mean
is
whether
the
persons
or
individuals
within
the
company
who
promulgated
the
amendment
had
the
corporate
authority
to
do
so.
if
they
did
not,
it
was
not
an
action
by
the
company
at
all.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
no,
it
does
not.
the
authority
can
either
be
express
or
it
can
be
inferred
from
circumstance,
pursuant
to
longstanding
corporate
principles.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i
think
it's
un--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--i
think
it's
unclear
from
footnote
3
what
judge
roth's
view
was.
if
that
was
judge
roth's
view,
then
i
would
disagree
with
it.
because
she
didn't
write
a
separate
opinion,
i
think
it's
rather
unclear
from
the
text.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
she
may
have
concluded
that
in
this
case
it
was
neither
expressly
delegated...
the
authority
was
neither
expressly
delegated
to
those
individuals,
or
that
it
was
neither
expressly
delegated
nor
impliedly
delegated.
she
may
have
come
to
that--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--there
was
a
significant
record
before
the
district
court
regarding
the
manner
in
which
the
amendment
was
promulgated.
there
are
facts
in
that
record
that
seem
to
cut
both
ways.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i
agree
with
you,
judge
ginsburg,
that
it
would
be
extraordinary.
i
just
don't
know
whether
judge
roth
did,
in
fact,
make
that
finding
or
whether
she
did
not.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
there
will
be
some
circumstances
in
which
it
will
not
be
clear
who
the
persons
are
who
have
the
authority
to
amend,
and
let
me
give
an
example,
because
i
think
that's
the
best--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--it
will
not
be
clear
as
a
matter
of...
well,
let
me
step
back
from
that.
we
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
the
term
"person"
includes
the
term
"corporation"
and,
in
fact,
because
it
includes
the
term
"corporation",
when
congress
intended
to
refer
solely
to
natural
persons,
it
used
the
term,
"individual",
and
it
did
that
scores
of
times
throughout
the
act.
here,
where
it
used
the
term
"person",
we
believe
it
did
so
intentionally,
so
that
identification
of
the
corporation
would
be
sufficient.
however,
there
are
circumstances,
for
example,
when
you've
got
a
standard
form
plan,
that
would
be
a
plan
that
would
be
promulgated
by
a
banker
insurance
company
and
marketed
to
individual
employers.
that
plan
may
state
that
the
sponsoring
organization,
which
would
be
the
banker
insurance
company,
would
reserve
the
authority
to
amend
certain
of
the
boilerplate
provisions.
the
more
tailored
provisions
could
be
amended
by
the
employer.
by
specifying
the
sponsoring
organization
can
amend,
one
would
look
to
find
out...
it's
a
simple
procedure,
but
one
would
take
the
second
step
of
looking
to
find
out
who
the
sponsoring
organization
was
in
order
to
determine
the
person
with
the
authority
to
make
those
particular
amendments.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
yes,
you
would,
but--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--you
could
do
that,
but
if
i
might
take
a
step
backwards,
we
do
not--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--no.
we
believe
that
the--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--we
believe
that
the
purposes
of
402(b)(3)
is
primarily
functional,
and
that
purpose
is
to
make
a
plan
amendable
by
providing
a
mechanism
or
a
way
that
it
can
be
amended,
and
to
delegate
the
power
to
amend
to
an
individual.
the
person--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--yes,
although
i
wouldn't
restrict
it
to
simply
multiemployer
circumstances.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that
is
our
view,
justice
ginsburg,
and
we
don't
believe
that
that
leaves
the
beneficiaries
and
participants
out
in
the
cold.
the
plan
fiduciary
has
an
independent
duty,
under
section
404(a)
of
the
act,
to
perform
his
or
her
duties
solely
in
the
interests
of
the
participants
and
beneficiaries,
and
to
administer
the
plan
in
accordance
with
its
terms,
so
the
fiduciary
will
have
a
duty,
given
uncertainty,
to
determine
what
it
is...
who
it
is
that
has
the
ability
to
amend,
and
whether
they
have
followed
the
manner
of
amendment
that
that
set
forth.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
no,
it
has
not.
it
has
not.
i'd
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
second
question
presented
in
this
case,
which
is
whether,
if
the
court
were
to
determine
that
the
procedure
in
this
case
was
not
sufficient,
that
would
mean
that
the
amendment
was
therefore
invalid.
when
a
plan
makes
clear
that
the
plan
can
be
amended
by
the
plan
sponsor,
it
would
be
odd
in
our
view
to
interpret
that
document
to
be
unamendable
simply
because
it
lacked
a
detailed
description
of
the
manner
of
amendment.
it
would
be
far
more
natural,
in
our
view,
to
recognize
the
effectiveness
of
the
amendment
if
the
person
identified
has
clearly
manifested
its
or
his
intention
to
change
the
plan.
that's
the
approach
that
was
used
under
the
common
law
of
trusts,
and
it
is
an
approach
that
in
our
view
is
consistent
with
congress'
basic
intention,
which
is
that
plans
be
amendable.
further,
it's
an
approach
that
is
consistent,
in
our
view,
with
the
interests
of
participants
and
beneficiaries.
when
you
have
a
circumstance
such
as
in
this
case,
where
it's
clear
that
the
plan
can
be
amended,
and
it's
clear
that
the
plan...
that
the
plan
sponsor
has
said
that
the
plan
has
been
amended,
the
harm
suffered
by
the
participants
and
beneficiaries,
if
they've
suffered
harm,
has
been
from
the
substance
of
the
amendment,
not
from
the
failure
to
provide
a
procedure.
it
would
be
inconsistent,
we
believe,
with
congress'
intent
that
beneficiaries
and
participants
be
able
to
rely
on
the
terms
of
the
document
as
written
to
invalidate
the
plan
under
these
circumstances.
that
leaves,
of
course,
the
question
of
whether
erisa
itself
prohibits
amendments
in
the
absence
of
a
plan
procedure.
we
do
not
believe
that
it
does.
the
harm
caused
by
the
failure
to
have
a
procedure
is
the
failure
to
provide
guidance
to
the
fiduciaries.
the
fiduciaries
will,
in
the
ordinary
course,
simply
go
to
the
employer
in
that
kind
of
a
circumstance
and
request
further
guidance,
more
detailed
procedures.
in
the
unlikely
event
that
the
corporation
or
sponsor
were
to
refuse,
erisa
provides
a
tailored
remedy.
under
section
502(a)(3),
the
fiduciary
can
enjoin
the
employer
to
provide
a
more
specific
procedure.
because
erisa
provides
that
remedy,
it
need
not
be
read
to
provide
a
remedy
of
invalidation,
or
to
require
a
procedure
for
amendment
as
a
condition
precedent
to
amendment.
we
agree
with
petitioner
that
the
act
cannot
honestly
be
read...
that
402(b)(3)
should
not
be
read
to
provide...
to
serve
as
a
condition
precedent,
because
there
are
various
other
provisions
in
the
act
in
which
congress
has
made
clear
its
intention
to
have
a
condition
precedent
when
it
wanted
to.
finally,
we
believe
that
reading
402(b)(3)
as
a
condition
precedent
is
inconsistent
with
the
approach
to
402
more
generally.
the
failure
to
have
a
written
plan
does
not
mean
that
no
plan
exists.
the
failure
to
provide
a
procedure
for
establishing
a
funding
policy
does
not
mean
that
there
is
no
funding
policy,
or
that
the
plan
no
longer
has
a
requirement
to
fund.
similarly,
we
would
advocate
that
the
failure
to
have
a
procedure
for
amendment
in
the
written
document
does
not
mean
that
a
procedure
does
not
exist,
nor
does
it
mean
that
the
procedure
has
not
been
followed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--thank
you.
