justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
reich...
you
say
reich,
not
reich?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
mr.
reich,
what
do
you
make
of
the
requirement
in
section
402(b)(3)
that
says,
not
only
must
there
be
a
procedure
for
amending
the
plan,
but
also
a
procedure
for
identifying
persons
with
amendment
authority?
it's
written
as
though
there
were
two
separate
requirements.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
as
applied
here,
you
think
its
surplusage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
applied
in
this
case
with
a
single
employer
voluntary
welfare
benefit
plan,
is
the
identification
of
the
person
who
has
the
authority
to
amend
just
surplusage?
is
that
your
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
multiemployer
plan--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--you
wouldn't
know
who
would
have
the
authority,
unless
it
was
stated.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
reich,
if
we
think
that
the
third
circuit
erred
in
saying
that
there
was
no
procedure
for
amending
the
plan
here,
what
do
we
do
about
the
identification
issue?
do
we
remand
it
to
the
court
below
to
resolve
whether
someone
had
authority
to
amend
it
in
this
instance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
it
turned
out
that
in
fact
no
amendment
had
been
adopted?
could
the
court
so
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
just
asking,
if
i
may,
what
if
the
facts
in
a
given
case
showed
there
had
been
no
plan
amendment.
do
you
say
that
a
court
lacks
the
authority
to
say
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
that's
your
position
in
this
case,
but
what
if
there
had
not
been,
could
a
court
not
say
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
you're...
that's
okay.
you're
just
not
answering
my
question,
but
that's
enough,
i
think.
your
time's
up.
thank
you,
mr.
reich.
mr.
bress,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
bress,
would
you
mind
enlightening
us
as
to
what
you
think
the
court
should
do
if
we
think
the
third
circuit
got
it
wrong
with
respect
to
whether
it
had
reserved
the
right
to
amend
the
plan,
the
company?
what
do
we
do
with
respect
to
whether
there
was
authority
given
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
authority
have
to
be
formalized
in
some
way
in
the
government's
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
disagree
with
judge
roth
and
her
view
in
this
case
on
that
point?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
she
seemed
to
think
it
had
to
be
by
some
action
of
the
board
of
directors.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
for
many
years,
the
petitioner
curtiss-wright
provided
post-retirement
health
benefits
to
certain
retired
employees
including
the
responders.
in
early
1983,
this
post-retirement
health
benefits
plan
was
changed
in
a
way
that
eventually
led
to
the
termination
of
the
benefits
for
the
retirees,
and
the
retirees
sued
curtiss-wright
claiming
among
other
things
that
the
plan
did
not
contain
an
amendment
procedure
as
acquired
by
section
402(b)(3)
of
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974
or
erisa
as
it?s
called,
and
claiming
that
the
proper
remedy
for
such
a
violation
is
to
declare
the
amendment
null
and
void.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
retirees
and
ordered
payment
of
back
health
benefits.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
curtiss-wright
argued
that
post-retirement
health
benefit
did
contain
a
valid
amendment
procedure,
namely
a
clause
that
states
the
company
reserves
a
right
at
any
time
to
amend
the
plan.
in
curtiss-wright?s
views
a
clause
sets
forth
an
amendment
procedure
as
required
by
the
statute
because
it
says
in
effect
that
the
plan
is
to
amended
by
the
company.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
this
argument.
in
its
view
the
amendment
by
the
company
is
too
vague
to
count
as
a
valid
amendment
procedure.
the
court
reasoned
that
in
passing
section
402(b)(3)
congress
intended
the
amendment
procedures
to
convey
enough
detail
to
enable
beneficiaries
of
the
plan,
to
learn
the
terms
of
the
plan
at
any
time
and
that
procedure
should
specify
the
individuals
or
the
committee
within
the
company
having
the
amendment
authority.
we
now
reverse;
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute
do
not
require
any
level
of
detail
in
the
amendment
procedure.
the
statute
requires
only
that
there
would
be
an
amendment
procedure,
and
here
there
is
such
a
procedure
in
our
view.
as
for
the
court
of
appeals
views
that
congress
intended
amendment
procedures
to
convey
enough
detail
to
enable
the
plan
beneficiaries
to
learn
their
rights
and
obligations,
we
do
not
find
support
for
that.
one
of
erisa?s
central
goals
is
certainly
that
of
having
a
plan
that
would
enable
beneficiaries
to
learn
their
rights,
but
erisa
already
has
an
elaborate
scheme
in
place
to
accomplish
that
goal.
a
scheme
that?s
built
around
reliance
on
written
plan
documents,
and
it?s
given
effect
through
an
exhaustive
set
of
disclosure
requirements.
we
don?t
reach
the
question
of
proper
remedy.
on
remand,
the
court
of
appeals
will
have
to
decide
the
question
that
has
always
been
at
the
heart
of
this
case,
whether
a
curtiss-wright's
valid
amendment
procedure,
amendment
by
the
company
was
complied
with
in
this
case.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
