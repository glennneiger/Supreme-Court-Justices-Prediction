mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government's
argument
in
this
case
absolutely
infuriates
me.
first
of
all,
they
mistake
the
record.
justice
ginsburg
was
correct
in
her
statement
with
regard
to
the
record,
and
i'll
cite
you
to
the
specific
parts
of
the
record
where
the
government
conceded
factual
issues
in
this
case.
on
page
24
on
the
joint
appendix
is
a
transcript
from
the
district
court
where
the
judge
of
the
district
court
asked
both
counsel,
are
there
in
this
case
any
triable
issues
of
fact?
both
counsel
stipulated
that
there
were
not.
the
judge
ultimately
decided
the
case
as
there
were
no
triable
issues
of
fact
and
that
the
sole
question
in
this
case
was
jurisdiction,
and
that
is
in
the
petitioner's
petition
for
cert,
page
9a
of
their
appendix.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
well,
in
our
complaint,
we
alleged
certain
facts,
and
then
in
their
answer
they
denied
these
facts,
and
then
the
government
in
their
conclusions
of
law
submitted
to
the
court,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
page
11,
their
number
12,
which
specifically
states
there
are
no
longer
any
genuine
issues
of
triable
fact,
which
to
me
means
that
whatever
the
issues
were
in
the
case
from
the
complaint
to
the
answer
no
longer
exist.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
the
judge
recharacterized
it
from
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
to
a
trial
on
stipulated
facts,
and...
originally
it
was
submitted
as
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
but
he
recharacterized
it.
he
said,
there
are
no
more
facts
to
try
here,
so
we're
going
to
recharacterize
as
a
trial
on
stipulated
facts,
and
sole
issue
being
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
the
government
in
essence
is
arguing
that
it
doesn't
matter,
because
the
government's
argument
is
that
she's
not
the
taxpayer,
that
she
has
no
jurisdiction
to
sue,
so
whether
or
not
their
collection
was
erroneous
or
not
is
really
irrelevant,
according
to
their
argument.
the
government
makes
this
convoluted
argument
about
the
statutory
scheme.
we
are
not
arguing
with
the
statutory
scheme
in
this
case.
we
agree
that
the
internal
revenue
code
provisions
are
pertinent
and
do
apply,
as
this
court
ruled
in
dalm
and
also
in
flora.
however,
the
government
blurs
the
statutory
scheme
in
this
case.
rather
than
looking
at
each
independent
statute
and
seeing
what
the
purpose
was,
both
as
a
matter
of
law
and
as
a
matter
of
tax
policy,
they
instead
blur
them
all
together
and
say,
this
prevents
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
sue,
simply
because
6511,
which
is
a
procedural
statute
of
limitations,
has
the
word
7422,
which
is
the
cause
of
action
section,
does
not
have
the
word
"taxpayer"
in
it.
it
requires
that,
as
a
matter
of
tax
policy,
the
petitioner
file
an
administrative
claim
with
the
internal
revenue
service,
which
she
did,
and
as
a
matter
of
tax
policy
there's
justification
for
that.
why
file
an
action
in
district
court,
and
incur
additional
litigation,
if
you
could
just
ask
the
irs
for
your
money
back,
and
if
they
agree
with
you
and
they
review
that
and
they
realize
they
made
an
error--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--no.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
reflect
that,
and
they
probably...
and
this
is
just
my
speculation...
dismiss
them
as
a
matter
of
course,
but
we
went
through,
and
went
through
the
process
of
filing
this
administrative--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--they
dismiss
the
administrative
claim
for
refund,
and
the
reason
they
gave
in
this
case--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--that's
their
position,
but
we
complied
with
the
statutory
scheme
by
filing
the
administrative
claim,
which
was
then
denied,
and
we
then
proceeded
to
district
court.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
well,
the
government's
position
with
regard
to
6511
makes
that
provision
the
charles
atlas
of
all
tax
provisions,
because
it
literally
reaches
across
from
title
to
title
and
injects
28.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
but
the
actual
language
in
6511
is
not
limiting
jurisdiction.
it
is
solely
a
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
no,
actually,
counsel
misstated
the
purpose
of
7422.
section
7422
requires
the
administrative
claim
for
refund
to
be
filed
with
the
internal
revenue
service.
that
is
governed
not
under
6511,
but
under
6532(a),
which
says
that
the
administrative
claim
for
refund
must
be
filed
with
the
internal
revenue
service,
and
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
6
months
to
review
your
claim.
it's
a--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--it
doesn't
say,
by
the
taxpayer,
so
there's
no
limitation
there.
you
know,
over
the
years
that
i've
been
involved
in
this
case,
i've
wondered
why
is
the
government
taking
such
a
harsh
position
in
this
case,
such
an
inequitable
position,
and
after
reading
their
brief
for
4
years,
i'm
still
not
all
that
sure
why
they're
taking
this
position,
but
i
think--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--they
are
fairly
strict,
but
they
should
be
fair.
they
should
be
fair
as
a
matter
of
tax
policy.
i
don't
think
when
congress
enacts
tax
legislation
that
they're
trying
to
be
inequitable
to
people.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
sure.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
we're
not
arguing
that
she's
going
to
go
into
court
and
litigate
the
liability
of
her
ex-husband.
we--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--we're--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--no.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
we
mentioned
in
a
footnote
as
an
irony
that
not
only
did
she
not
owe
the
taxes,
but
her
ex-husband
didn't
owe
the
taxes,
either,
but
we're
not
saying
that
she
was
go
into
court
and
litigate
his
tax
liability.
that's
his
problem,
not
hers.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
no,
i
think
this
court
can
limit
its
holding
to
simply
whether
or
not
the
person
that
paid
the
taxes
owed
the
taxes.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
the
language--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--exactly,
and
the
language
of
the
jurisdictional
statute
focuses
on
the
language,
erroneous
collection.
was
there
an
erroneous
collection
as
to
mrs.
williams?
yes,
there
was.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
she
didn't
owe
the
taxes.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
any--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--any
sum
alleged
to
have
been
excessive,
or
in
any
manner
wrongfully
collected
under
the
internal
revenue.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
yes,
it
is.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
let's
say
that
she
litigates,
and
the
district
court
rules
that
she
didn't
owe
the
taxes,
and
the
taxes
were
erroneously
collected
as
to
her.
the
government
then
proceeds
against
the
ex-husband.
why
shouldn't
he
have
the
right
to
go
into
court
and
litigate
whether
he
owed
the
taxes
or
not?
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
correct.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
i'm
going
to
give
you
sort
of
an
abstract
analogy,
but
i'd
like
you
to
follow
along
just
for
a
second.
there's
a
bridge
that
spans
from
san
francisco
to
oakland
called
the
oakland
bay
bridge,
and
in
the
middle
is...
it's
actually
two
bridges,
because
there's
a
span
that
goes
to
angel
island,
and
then
there's
a
span
that
goes
on
to
oakland.
the
government
has
to
prove
in
this
case,
number
1,
if
they're
going
to
say
that
lori
rabin
williams'
property
was
liable
for
these
taxes,
they
have
to
show
why.
they
have
to
show
that
her
ex-husband
owed
the
taxes,
number
1,
and
that
number
2,
he
still
had
some
interest
in
this
property,
and
then
move
that
across
the
second
span
to
her.
our
argument
is,
in
this...
the
facts
in
this
particular
case,
the
second
span
of
that
bridge,
they
can't
cross
that
at
all,
and
the
first
span
of
the
bridge,
they
can
only
cross
that
for
about
25
percent,
because
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
he
didn't
even
owe
75
percent
of
the
taxes.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
she's
going
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
tax
lien
that
was
placed
on
her
property
after
she
had
been
conveyed
the
property
for
adequate
consideration
and
under
the
internal
revenue
code
that
lien
was
in
error.
it
was
based
on
that
lien
that
the
government
collected
the
taxes.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
by
first
paying...
no.
she
had
three
alternatives.
she
could
have
filed
an
action
for
quiet
title.
she
could
have
put
the
money
in
the
trust
fund
if
the
government
acquiesced
in
that.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
absolutely
not,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
of
the
way
the
lien
arose.
she
received
the
lien
notice
7
days--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--no,
she
would
not
lose
on
the
merits.
the
facts...
a
lien
is
filed
7
days
before
escrow
is
closed.
that
means
that
the
quiet
title
option
is
not
a
viable
alternative.
it
does
not
mean
that
in
other
facts
it
may
be
a
viable
alternative.
the
key
focus,
though,
is
that
these
remedies
are
not
mutually
exclusive.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
correct.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
and
she
could
file
a
claim
for
refund
if
she
acquiesces
in
the
payment
of
the
taxes
under
duress--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--that
is
the
issue
here.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
yes.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
6532
is
the
statute
that
provides
that
the
administrative
claim
filed
with
the
internal
revenue
service
must
be
allowed
to
be
considered
for
6
months
or--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--i
believe
that's
6511,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
well,
i'm
not
relying
on
that
section
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
i'm
using
it
as
the
statute
of
limitations
as
well.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
well,
the--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--sure.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
well,
for
example,
the
definitional
section,
7701(a),
as
part
of
the
preamble,
specifically
states,
number
1,
the
definition
of
taxpayer
shall
only
be
used
in
this
title,
which
means
it
doesn't
apply
in
the
jurisdictional
sections,
title
28,
and
it
also
states
that
the
definitions
in
7701
shall
not
be
manifestly
incompatible
with
the
intent
of
the
statutes.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
well,
when
the
word
is
used
in
a
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--that's
the
generic
sense
that
the
word
is
used,
unless
it's
defined
differently--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--as
a
term
of
art.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
that's
right.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
and
we
make
that
point
in
our
brief,
that
she
paid
the
tax.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
when
the
word
is
used
in
the
generic
sense--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--sure.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
absolutely.
the
fear
that
i
bring
up
that
the
government
has--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--there's
a
distinction
between
volunteering
to
pay
somebody
else's
tax,
and
being
in
a
position
where
you're
coerced
or
persuaded
to
pay
another
person's
tax.
there
is
a
distinction.
the
distinction,
though,
is
that
in
the
coerced
or
persuaded
situation
there's
no
possibility
of
the
tax
evasion
or
the
floodgates
argument
that
the
government
is
arguing
in
this
case,
because
it's
the
government
that
initiated
the
collection
action.
where's
the
scheme
there?
the
government
started
the
ball
rolling.
in
the
pure,
true
volunteer
situation...
let's
say
a
father
pays
the
taxes
of
a
son
to
help
him
out
for
altruistic
reasons,
and
a
year
later
discovers
that
the
taxes
were
paid
in
error
because,
for
example,
there
was
something
wrong
on
the
son's
return.
why
should
not
that
father
be
allowed
to
proceed
to
court
and
prove
that
there
was
an
error
in
collection
here?
now,
the
government
contends,
well,
there's
possibilities
of
evasion
here.
there's
possibilities
that
there
will
be
a
slew
of
litigation
on
refund
suits.
i'd
like
to
take
a
moment--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--no.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
no,
i'm
not.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
the
facts
in
this
case
obviously
were
the
duress
situation,
and
we
absolutely
say
that
there's
no
possibility
for
the
government's
fears
to
come
forward
in
that
particular
situation,
but
in
the
volunteer
sense,
and
this
court
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
go
that
far,
but
as
a
matter
of
tax
policy,
why
not?
why
can't
a
person
who
in
error
paid
tax,
voluntarily
even,
why--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--i
would
assume
so,
under
the
facts
of
that
hypothetical,
that
if
the
work
was
never
performed,
it
would
be
a
defense
to
a
mechanic's
lien,
although
i'm
not
an
expert
in
mechanic's
lien
law,
so
i
might
be
misspeaking.
your
honor,
i
would
like,
once
again,
to
just
take
a
moment
to
go
into
what
the
government's
concerns
are,
and
to
perhaps
alleviate
some
of
their
fears.
in
the
situation
that
the
government
cites
in
their
brief,
the
possibility
for
tax
evasion,
you
would
have
to
have,
in
essence,
two
parties,
on
one
hand
a
taxpayer,
the
person
that
owes
the
tax
under
their
definition,
and
a
friend...
let's
call
him
a
coconspirator.
that
coconspirator
says
to
his
taxpayer
friend,
i'm
going
to
pay
your
taxes,
we're
going
to
wait
for
the
statute
of
limitations
to
expire,
i'm
going
to
help
you
evade
taxes,
and
then
i'm
going
to
file
a
refund
suit.
that
situation
is
somewhat
preposterous
in
real
life.
you're
talking
about
a
situation
where
a
person's
going
to
come
out
of
pocket,
using
the
numbers
in
this
case,
$40,000,
on
the
hopes
that
they
might
get
their
money
back
if
they
file
a
refund
claim,
just
to
help
their
friend
evade
taxes
because
the
statute
of
limitations
is
expiring.
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
my
response
is
on
line
with
the
courts
that
have
ruled
on
this,
and
i
cited
a
few
in
my
brief,
which
were
not
authority
to
this
court,
but
i
cited
them
just
so
that
you
could
see
how
other
judges
have
gone
through
the
same
analysis,
which
is
that
the
word
6511
is
used
in
its
generic
sense,
that
it's
used
as
the
person
who
pays
the
taxes.
it's
not
used
as
a
term
of
art
in
that
sense.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
use
it
as
a
term
of
art,
why
wouldn't
they
have
just
put
it
in
the
cause
of
action
section,
7422?
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
i
agree,
in
essence
with
what
the
justice
was
just
asking
me,
which
is
that
it's
construed
in
its
generic
sense
in
6511,
which
makes
6511
the
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
philip
garrett
panitz
--if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
i
thank
you
for
your
time.
