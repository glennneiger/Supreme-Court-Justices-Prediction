well,
that's
the
statute
of
limitations
section.
justice

now,
did
this
taxpayer
file
an
administrative
claim
for
refund
first?
i
thought
she
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
she
was
in
effect
compelled
by
the
government
to
do
something
because
the
lien
had
been
slapped
on
the
house
and
she
was
trying
to
sell
it,
and
there
is
a
degree
of
government
compulsion.
it's
not
like
the
volunteer
that
you've
been
concerned
about
in
your
brief.
this
is
someone
who
had
a
lot
of
pressure
put
on
her
to
dispose
of
this
thing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
except
that's
a
discretionary
thing
with
the
irs,
and
here
she's
got
an
escrow
that's
going
to
close
in
a
week,
and
is
there
any
indication
in
the
world
that
the
irs
would
have
given
her
this?
they
didn't
come
to
her
and
say,
look,
you
can
do
this,
and
we'll
offer
to
let
you
put
it
in
escrow.
they
didn't
tell
her
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
asked
for
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
gather.
