justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
point
is,
isn't
it,
that
you
don't
really
care,
under
your
reading
of
the
statute?
they
can
act
with
total
arbitrariness
and
there's
still
no
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there's
no...
section
3225(b)(3)
doesn't
help
if
the
government
acts
with
total
arbitrariness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
would
have
been
jurisdiction
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
saying
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
accept
that.
i
don't
see
why
it's
so
much
more
horrible
if
she's
got
two
reasons
for
getting
the
money
back,
1)
that
she
was
put
upon,
and
2)
that
the
tax
wasn't
owed
in
the
first
place.
why
is
that
so
horrible?
