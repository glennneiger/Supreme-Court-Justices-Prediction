are
there
any
authorities
indicating
that
the
irs
has
processed
and
paid
administrative
claims
that
are
filed
by
persons
other
than
the
taxpayer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
dismiss
the
claims?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
position
of
the
irs
has
been
consistent
that
it
will
only
honor
refund
claims
when
filed
by
the
taxpayer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
it
wrongfully
collected
if
it
wasn't
owed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
clear
to
me,
what
is
it
that
she
wants
to
contest
if
she
goes
into
the
district
court?
you're
saying
that
she
is
not
going
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
tax
assessed
against
the
husband?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
only
way
she
can
challenge
that
is
by
first
paying
the
tax?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the
quiet
title
have
been
adequate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
what
you're
saying
is
that
she'd
lose
on
the
merits?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
so
quiet
title
is
one.
substitute
property,
by
putting
the
funds
in
escrow
is
another,
but
that's
discretionary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
anything
else?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
although
that's
the
issue
that
is
before
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
we
do
have
to
go
that
far,
under
your
interpretation
of
the
statute.
let
me
ask
you
one
question
before
you
get
back
to
the
internal
revenue
code
section.
what
about
a
mechanic's
lien?
suppose
that
a
person
closes
an
escrow
knowing
that
there's
a
mechanic's
lien
on
the
house,
so
that
the
mechanic's
lien
passes
to
the
subsequent
purchaser,
can
the
purchaser
challenge
the
mechanic's
lien
on
the
ground
that
the
work
was
never
performed?
