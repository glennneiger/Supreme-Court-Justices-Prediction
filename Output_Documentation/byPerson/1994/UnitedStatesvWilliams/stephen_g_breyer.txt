it's
not
that
it's
far
removed,
it's...
at
least
in
my
mind.
it
seems...
a
woman
pays
the
tax
her
husband
owes,
and
she
has
to
do
it,
because
she
can't
sell
the
property
otherwise,
in
my
imaginary
case.
now,
that
tax
was
unlawfully
assessed.
there
should
be
some
way
she
could
be
able
to
get
the
money
back,
and
one
way
to
get
the
money
back
is,
she
brings
a
refund
suit.
that
would
work.
and
you
tell
us,
no,
there's
this
other
way,
but
the
trouble
with
the
other
way
is,
it
gives
the
discretionary
power
to
the
district,
and
they
write
that
right
in
the
regs...
this
is
discretionary.
so
that's
a
problem
with
the
other
way.
now,
what
happens
bad
to
the
law
if
we
try
the
first
way?
that
is,
suppose
we
read
the
word,
refund
suit,
to
apply
to
this
situation,
and
you
say
yes,
they
have
to
file
a
claim,
but
nothing
in
65...
nothing
in
6511(a)
says
that
the
husband
or
the
wife
of
the
taxpayer
couldn't
do
it.
that's
a
statute
of
limitations
provision.
so
what
would,
bad,
happen
to
the
law
if
you
read
the
refund
thing
the
way
your
opponents
want
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
if
you
just
said
the
person
who
paid
the
money
can
file
to
get
her
money
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
if
i
have
to
read--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
your
mind,
the
sanctity
of
the
following
proposition.
person
a
should
not
be
able
to
litigate
the
liability
of
taxpayer
b.--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
sacred.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
that
is,
in
my
mind,
not
a
tax
expert,
what
do
i
read?
what
one
thing
can
i
read
that
will
help
me
understand
the
sacredness
of
that
principle?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
flora?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
fine.
thank
you.
dalm
was
not
your
proudest
moment,
i
don't
think.
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
panitz.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
they
argue
that
it
is
fair.
their
argument
is,
you
didn't
follow
the
right
route.
they
said,
there's
the
sacred
principle
person
a
should
not
be
able
to
litigate
the
tax
liability
of
b,
so
if
your
client
is
concerned
with
b's
tax
liability,
that
should
not
be
up
to
her.
if
your
client
feels
that
they
didn't
assess
the
lien
and
do
the
procedural
stuff
properly,
there
is
a
perfectly
good
route.
you
go
to
the
irs,
you
make
a
deal
with
them,
you
sell
the
property,
you
pay
the
proceeds
into
the
fund,
and
you
conduct
your
argument
vis-a-vis
the
proceeds.
now,
there's
a
flaw
in
that
route.
the
flaw
is
the
word
"may"
which
in
the
regs
have
turned
into
"discretionary",
but
they
say
that
flaw
in
practice
is
not
important,
while
the
other
flaw
of
accepting
your
argument
is
very
important,
because
if
we
accept
your
argument,
a
can
litigate
the
underlying
tax
liability
of
b,
and
that
violates
the
sacred
principle.
so
where
we
all
are
is,
how
sacred...
or,
at
least
where
i
am
is,
how
sacred
is
this
principle,
what
will
happen...
i'm
spelling
out
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
want
you
to...
yes,
to
reply
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
we
agree
with
you,
it
would
happen.
it
wouldn't
happen
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
that
doesn't
matter,
because
even
if
you
won't,
the
next
person
could.
their
problem
is,
once
we
take
this
route
on
the
law,
it's
open
to
a's
to
litigate
the
tax
liability
of
b's.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
fanciful,
but
they're
worried,
i
think,
about
another
thing.
what
statute
of
limitations
would
govern?
you'd
have
to
either
call
your
client
a
taxpayer,
which
would
then
give
the
words
"taxpayer"
different
meanings
in
different
sections
of
the
code,
which
is
worrying
them,
or
alternatively
you'd
have
to
say,
she's
not
a
taxpayer,
and
then
it
would
seem
that
no
statute
of
limitations
would
govern.
we'd
have
to
create
one.
so
that's
one
of
the
problems
they've
raised.
so
how
do
you
respond
to
that
one?
