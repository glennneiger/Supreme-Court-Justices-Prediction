mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
person
whose
property
has
become
entangled
in
government
efforts
to
collect
taxes
owed
by
someone
else
has
a
broad
variety
of
remedies.
the
nontaxpayer
may
challenge
the
government
collection
action
in
a
wrongful
levy,
a
quiet
title,
or
a
foreclosure
proceeding,
and
may
obtain
a
release
of
the
federal
lien
if
they
want
to
make
an
immediate
sale
by
providing
substitute
collateral
from
the
proceeds
of
the
sale.
historically,
however,
nontaxpayers
have
not
been
permitted
simply
to
pay
the
tax
and
sue
for
a
refund.
the
collateral
litigation
of
tax
obligations
by
nontaxpayers
would
present
a
quagmire
of
problems
that
the
courts
and
congress
have
not
traditionally
sanctioned.
in
this
case,
however,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
a
nontaxpayer
whose
property
became
subject
to
a
lien
that
arose
from
someone
else's
obligations
may
simply
pay
the
tax,
even
though
she
admittedly
didn't
owe
it,
and
sue
for
a
refund.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
justice
ginsburg,
we
don't
concede
that.
indeed,
the
facts
reflect
that
the
lien
would
have
been
valid
as
against
the
nontaxpayer
because
she
took
the
property
from
her
husband
without
qualifying
as
a
purchaser.
she
took
the
property
from
her
husband
without
paying
what
the
statute
requires,
full
and
adequate
consideration
in
money
or
money's
worth.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
not...
not
quite.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
neither
court,
if
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--after
the
transfer,
and
our
point
with
respect
to
that
is
that
the
notice
of
lien
is
not
needed
to
be
valid
as
against
a
person
who
took
the
property
without
qualifying
as
a
purchaser,
under
6323
of
the
code.
the
respondent
in
this
case--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
issue
hasn't
been
reached
by
either
of
the
courts
below,
because
this
issue...
the
case
has
been
decided
solely
on
jurisdictional
grounds.
the
court
of...
the
district
court
found
no
jurisdiction
because
she
wasn't
a
taxpayer
and
couldn't
sue
under
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
found
jurisdiction
and
ordered
the
case
remanded
for
consideration
of
the
merits
of
our
lien.
we
brought
the
case
to
this
court
solely
on
the
jurisdictional
issue.
if
the
court
thinks
there's
no
jurisdiction,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
if
the
court
thinks
there
is
jurisdiction,
it
should
be
remanded
for
that
type
of
issue
that
you've
just
described
to
be
discussed.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
short
answer
to
that
question
is
that
the
waiver
of
immunity
for
a
claim
that
would
fall
within
1346(a)(1)
is
in
section
7422(f)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
sir,
7422(f)--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--is
a
statute
that
says
that
a
claim
of
the
type
permitted
by
7422(a)...
this
is
very
complicated.
i
just
want
to
say
that
at
the
outset.
7422(f)
says
that
a
claim
of
the
type
permitted
by
7422(a)
must
be
brought
against
the
united
states
rather
than
the
district
director,
who
used
to
be
the
collector.
if
you
will
recall,
at
common
law
these
tax
refund
suits
could
not
be
brought
against
the
united
states.
they
were
brought
against
the
collector.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
believe
that's
correct.
"i
would
like
to
cite
the
helvering
case.
"
used
to
be
an
easy
answer
to
a
tax
question.
but
let
me
focus,
if
i
may,
on
exactly
the
rationale
of
the
court
below
and
why
we
think
it's
wrong.
the
court
said
that
the
simple
language
of
1346(a)(1)
says
that
a
suit
may
be
brought
against
the
united
states
for
the
recovery
of
any
tax
illegally
or
erroneously
assessed
or
collected.
the
court
said
the
plain
language
says
that
if
you're
alleging
that
the
tax
is
illegally
assessed
or
erroneously
collected,
you
can
proceed.
the
central
premise
of
that
analysis
is
that
it
is
appropriate
to
view
1346(a)(1)
in
complete
isolation
from
any
other
provision
of
the
code,
and
this
court
has
twice
rejected
that
very
contention
in
the
flora
case
and
again
most
recently
in
united
states
v.
dalm.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
1921.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
provision
that
this
court
held
in
dalm
modifies
1346(a)(1)
is
1724(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
1724(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
was
enacted
in
1878.
its
language
was
the
model
from
which
1346(a)(1)
was
drawn
when
jurisdiction
was
first
provided
for
suits
against
the
united
states.
before
jurisdiction
was
provided
for
suits
against
the
united
states
for
tax
refunds,
7422(a)
of
the
code
had
already
been
in
existence
for
almost
50
years.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
they--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
is,
in
fact,
7422(a).
7244(a)
says
that
any
claim
for
refund
must
first
be
filed
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
before
it
may
be
maintained
in
any
court.
in
dalm,
the
court
concluded
that's
a
jurisdictional
limit.
that's
an
express
limit
on
the
jurisdiction
that
coexists
with
1346...
you
have
to
read
these
together...
and
the
court
further
said
in
dalm
that
to
decide
what
that
meant
you
have
to
file
the
claim
for
refund
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
you
have
to
go
to
6511
of
the
code.
6511
of
the
code
requires
that
the
administrative
refund
claim
be
filed
by
the
taxpayer.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
can't
say.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
doubt
that,
but
i
can't
say.
the
requirement
of
an
administrative
refund
claim
has
existed
since
1878.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
absolutely
right,
but
74...
our
point
is
that
7422(a)
requires
that
there
be
a
refund
claim
filed
in
accordance
with
law.
not
just
a
refund
claim,
a
refund
claim
filed
with
the
secretary
in
accordance
with
law,
and
i'm
making
the
same
point
that
the
court
made
in
deciding
the
dalm
case,
that
you
have
to
then
go
to
6511
to
see
what
that
means.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
actually,
i
believe
that
the
language
of
6511
would
apply
whether
or
not
a
return
is
required
to
be
filed.
the
taxpayer
is
required
to
file
the
administrative
refund
claim
within
3
years,
i
believe,
of
payment...
no,
i've
got
that
backwards.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
sorry,
i
don't
believe
that's
correct,
because
if
you
read
on,
at
page
3
of
our
brief
we
quote
this
provision.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
the
last
clause
of
that
sentence
says,
"or
if
no
return
was
filed
by
the
taxpayer.
"
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
she
can't
qualify
as
a
taxpayer
under
the
code.
however,
you
parse
the
last
clause,
and
i
just
respectfully
disagree
in
terms
of
how
that
language
parses.
the
way
it
has
always
been
understood...
and
when
i
say
always,
except
for
the
martin
case
and
this
case...
is
that
a
taxpayer
must
make
the
administrative
refund
claim,
and
that
only...
and
the
term
7701
of
the
code
to
mean
the
person
subject
to
the
tax.
it
is
a--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that
treatise's
description
of
the
law.
there
are--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
whether
it
was
debatable
or
not,
the
way
we
understand
the
cases
is
as
follows.
every
case
that
has
actually
addressed
the
question
of
whether
a
nontaxpayer
may
bring
a
refund
suit
has
said
no.
there
are
two
lines
of
authority
that
follow
along
that
same
principle.
one
line
of
authority
is
the
parsons
v.
anglim
type
case,
where
the
person
who
paid
the
tax
did
so
under
what
the
court
said
was
a
reasonable
assumption,
or
a
reasonable
belief
that
the
government
was
taking
the
position
she
was
the
taxpayer.
obviously,
a
person
can
come
in
the
court
and
say,
well,
i
paid
the
tax
because
you
claimed
it
was
due
from
me,
but
i
don't
think
i
owe
it.
i'm
not
really
the
taxpayer.
i
don't
owe
this
tax.
that's
one
line
of
authority.
the
other
line
of
authority
are
the
kinds
of
cases
like
stewart
v.
chinese
chamber
of
commerce,
which
is
cited
in
the
phillips
decision
in
the
second
circuit,
and
in
that
case
the
court
says
a
nontaxpayer
cannot
bring
a
refund
suit,
but
what
they
can
do...
and
this
may
relate
to
the
point
that
you
just
raised,
justice
ginsburg...
what
they
can
do
is
that
before
1966
they
could
sue
the
collector,
the
district
director,
to
recover
property
that
the
district
director
had
taken
to
pay
someone
else's
taxes.
now,
in
the
first
national
bank
of
amlinton
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
simply
as
the
first
national
bank
case,
it's
the
third
circuit
case,
the
court
explains
the
limit
on
that
branch,
if
you
will,
of
authority
to
recover
property,
and
that
is
that
once
the
government
has
sold
the
property
and
the
money
has
been
deposited
in
the
government's
treasury,
that
avenue
of
jurisdiction
doesn't
exist,
because
then
it
would
be
a
suit
against
the
united
states
for
a
refund.
so
i
don't
have
the
treatise
that
was
in
front
of
you.
it
wasn't
briefed,
and
i'm
not
able
at
this
moment
to
adequately--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
that
it...
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
i
submit
that
it
is
perfectly
accurate
to
say
that
other
than
the
two
lines
of
decisions
that
i
just
described,
every
court
that
has
addressed
this
subject
has
said,
other
than
martin
and
the
current
decision,
has
said
that
the...
a
nontaxpayer
may
not
sue
for
a
refund.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
have
been
a
variety
of
bases.
the
federal
court
of
claims
in
the
economy
plumbing
&
heating
case
applied
the
reasoning
that
i
have
described,
which
is...
and
the
court's
reasoning
in
dalm,
which
is,
you
have
to
read
these
statutes
together.
as
this
court
said
in
flora,
in
making
the
very
point
that
you
could
not
read
1346(a)(1)
in
isolation,
and
i'll
quote
the
court:
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
a
single
sentence
in
an
isolated
statute,
but
with
a
jurisdictional
provision
which
is
a
keystone
of
a
carefully
articulated
and
quite
complicated
structure
of
tax
laws.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'll
track
the
reasoning.
1346(a)(1)
permits
jurisdiction
for
suits
challenging
taxes.
let's
abbreviate
it
that
way.
7422
says
that
in
such
a
suit
you
can't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--of
the
internal
revenue
code,
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
says
that
such
a
suit
may
not
be
maintained
until
a
claim
has
first
been
filed
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
accordance
with
law.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
like
in
dalm,
we
go
on
to
6511,
and
6511
says
that
this
claim
that
has
to
be
filed
before
you
can
proceed
with
a
case
under
1346--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
it
does.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
6511(a),
it
says
that
the
claim
shall
be
filed
by
the
taxpayer
within
a
period
of
years
from
the
time
of
the
payment
of
the
tax
to
the
filing
of
the
return,
or
if
there
was
no
return--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
she
filed
an
administrative
claim
for
refund,
but
she
is
not
the
person
who
is
the
taxpayer.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
statutory
structure
that
i've
described
wasn't
the
result
of
historical
happenstance.
congress
has
long
been
aware
that
nontaxpayers
cannot
sue
for
a
refund
under
these
provisions,
and
instead
of
providing
jurisdiction
for
nontaxpayers
to
sue
for
a
refund,
they
provided
a
wholly
separate
set
of
remedies
directly
addressed
to
the
problems
that
nontaxpayers
face.
two
of
those
remedies
are
particularly
relevant
to
this
case.
section
7426...
well,
let
me
start
with
the
second
one,
because
it
more
directly
addresses
your
concern.
in
section
6325
of
the
code,
congress
provided
that
a
person
like
respondent,
whose
property
is
subject
to
a
lien
arising
from
someone
else's
taxes,
doesn't
have
to
pay
the
tax
to
remove
the
lien.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
might
i
first
state
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
conversations
that
did
or
did
not
occur
between
the
service
and
the
respondent
on
this
subject,
and
i
would
encourage--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--let
me
divide
your
question
from
the
foreclosure
to
this
sale
situation.
in
a
foreclosure
situation
is
when
a
suit
is
brought
and
everyone
is
going
to
know
then
that
the
validity
of
the
liens
is
going
to
be
adjudicated
in
that
fashion.
the
problem
that
justice
o'connor
was
addressing
was,
well,
what
if
someone
wants
to
make
a
sale
of
their
property?
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
that
question
any
better
than
to
say
that
congress
anticipated
that
concern
and
made
an
express
provision
for
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it
doesn't
quite...
well,
i
mean,
you
could
understand
it
to
mean
that,
but
what
it
says
is
that
he
may
in
his
discretion
enter
into...
the
commissioner
may
in
her
discretion
enter
into
these--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
think
that
anyone
doubts
that
the
commissioner
will
exercise
her
discretion
to
enter
into
these
agreements.
the
discretionary
aspect
of
it
is
what
exactly
the
agreement
needs
to
contain.
it
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
there's
nothing
on
that
in
this
record.
i
want
to
be
frank
about
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
sir,
i
wouldn't
say
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there's
no
refund
remedy,
that's
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
would
say
that
it
does,
because
if
someone...
if
the
commissioner
arbitrarily
abused
her
discretion
in
refusing
to
provide
a
substitute
collateral
agreement,
i
suppose
that
that
would
help
that
there
would
be
some
basis--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there
wouldn't
be
in
this
case,
justice
stevens--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--because
in
this
case
she
sued
for
a
refund.
she
didn't
follow
that
path,
so
what
would
or
wouldn't
have
happened
if
she
followed
that
path
is
something
we
don't
know.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it
says
it...
she
may
in
her
discretion.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
how
a
court
would
decide
whether
discretion
had
been
abused
in
a
particular
situation
is
frankly
a
little
bit
far
removed
from
the
question
we--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--which
is,
whether
there's
jurisdiction
for
a
refund
suit
for
a
person
who
didn't
do
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's...
to
us
that's
a
very
important
question,
because
we
think
that
this
result,
deviating
from
the
language
of
the
statutes
and
the
cases,
would
produce
incredibly
bad
results.
it's
difficult
to
describe
that
with
precision
precisely
because
there
is
not
a
track
record
of
cases
allowing
tax
refund
suits,
collateral
challenges
to
taxes
by
persons
who
aren't
taxpayers.
we--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--you
would
be
permitting
a
collateral
litigation
of
someone
else's
tax
liability
by
the
person
who
wasn't,
by
definition,
obligated
for
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
you
look
at
page
6,
footnote
3,
of
respondent's
brief,
you'll
see
that
they
do
contest
the
underlying
assessments.
they
have
done
so
in
the
district
court
at
page
8--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
understand
your
point.
there
isn't
any
easy
way
to
differentiate
to
reach
that
result.
you
can't
very
well
say
that
the
nontaxpayer
can
challenge
an
erroneous
collection
but
can't
challenge
an
unlawful
assessment
if
you
read
the
statute
on
its...
without
reading
anything
else,
and
i
don't
know
what
else
you'd
be
reading
to
import
that
requirement
in
the
1346(a)(1).
taking--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
it
wasn't...
that's
a
question
that
hasn't
been
resolved.
i
mean--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
problem...
i
take
it
we
accept
as
taken
that
there's
an
enormous
problem
from
allowing
the
collateral
litigation
of
the
liability
itself.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
okay.
we
don't
know
how
collateral
estoppel
and
res
judicata
would
apply
then.
would
we
have
to
bring
suits
against...
would
we
have
to
win
our
tax
cases
two
or
three
times?
clever
practitioners,
of
whom
there's
many,
would
be
able
to
identify
a
host
of
issues
here.
let
me
explain
one
simple
one.
it's
just
an
example.
the
statute
of
limitations.
what
statute
of
limitations
would
apply
to
a
refund
suit
by
a
nontaxpayer
section
6532--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--6532
is
the
statute
of
limitations
for
a
refund
suit.
it...
6511
is
for
the
refund
claim.
6532
is
for
a...
is
divided
into
two
parts.
the
first
part
is
suits
for
refund
by
taxpayers
and
it
provides
for
a
suit
may
be
brought
within
2
years
from
the
time
notice
of
disallowance
of
the
claim
is
given
to
the
taxpayer.
section...
the
other
half
of
6532
is
entitled,
suits
for
refund
by
persons
other
than
taxpayers,
and
it
gives
a
9-month
statute
of
limitation
for
suits
for
wrongful
levy
by
persons
other
than
taxpayers.
there
is
no
clear
answer
to
which
of
these--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there's
no
clear--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
what
it
says--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--for
an
overpayment--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--right,
and
there
was
no
overpayment
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
would
only
be...
but
beyond
that,
even
if
there
was
a
claim
of
an
overpayment,
it
would
only
be
maintained
in
court
under
1346
if
it
had
been
first
filed
as
an
administrative
claim
by
the
taxpayer.
the
taxpayer
is
defined
to
mean
the
person
subject
to
the
tax.
you
cannot
allow
non--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
from
80
years
of
cases
addressing
this
subject
that
have
reached
the
same
conclusion,
and
from
the
fact
that
congress
relied
on
that
conclusion
in
an
action--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
busse.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
seventh
circuit
decision
in
busse
is
just
like
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
only
consistent
with
the
two
lines
of
authority
i
described
earlier.
if
i
may...
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
didn't
understand
your
hypothetical,
and
i
think
i
may
need
to.
lot
2
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no
connection--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they
can
bring
it
to
the
irs'
attention,
and
the
irs
would
remove
the
lien.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
then
they
can
bring...
then
they
bring
a
quiet
title
action,
or
if
that's...
if
they're
in
a
big
hurry,
they
make
a
substitute
collateral
agreement.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it's
discretionary
in
our
view
in
the
sense
that
congress
wants
us
to
do
it
when
we
can
work
out
provisions
that
make
sense
in
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
think
that
anyone
has
suggested
that
we've
abused
our
discretion.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
a
foreclosure
suit
and
a
quiet
title
suit
are
wholly
separate
issues.
foreclosure
is
when
we--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they
bring
a
quiet
title
suit,
or
they
make
a
substitute
collateral
agreement
if
they're
in
a
hurry.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
then
there--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there's
the
same
kind
of
a
problem
they
would
have
with
any
private
creditor
who
has
a
lien.
i
mean,
there's
nothing
unique
about
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
pardon
me?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
sacrosanct.

kent
l.
jones

jones

court's
