justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
don't
think
6511
provides
what
you
say
it
provides,
because
6511
it
seems
to
me
doesn't
provide
anything
more
than
the
fact
that
a
claim
for
credit
or
refund
of
a
tax
with
respect
to
which
the
taxpayer
is
required
to
file
a
return
shall
be
filed
by
the
taxpayer
within
certain
periods.
it
doesn't
seem
to
address
the
question
of
a
refund
which
is
claimed
by
someone
who
was
not
required
to
file
a
return
as
a
taxpayer
in
the
first
place.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
applies
whether
or
not
a
return
was
filed.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
it
conditioned
upon
the
requirement
of
filing
by
the
taxpayer
when
the
taxpayer
is
the
claimant?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
isn't
that
what
the
text
says?
a
"claim
for
credit
or
refund
of
an
overpayment
of
any
tax
imposed
by
this
title
in
respect
of
which
tax
the
taxpayer
is
required
to
file
a
return
shall
be
filed
by
the
taxpayer
within.
"
certain
periods.
there
seems
to
be
a
condition
that
limits
the
application
of
this
to
refunds
by
a
taxpayer
who
was
required
to
file
a
return,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
speak
to
the
situation
we've
got
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
no
return
was
filed
by
the
taxpayer--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
here,
her
claim
is,
i
am
not
a
taxpayer
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
because
i
was
never
required
to
file
a
return
as
to
the
taxes
you
are
ultimately
collecting.
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
we
also
assume
that
congress
wants
some
sort
of
a
statute
of
limitations,
and
there
is
none
on
that
reading.
how
do
we
get
the
statute
of
limitations?
do
we
do
it
the
lampf
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
what
you
were
saying.
i
see.
