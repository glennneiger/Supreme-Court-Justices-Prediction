justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
do
you
concede
that
the
lien
was
improper
because
at
the
time
notice
of
it
was
given
the
person
who
allegedly
had
incurred
the
tax
liability
was
not
the
owner
of
the
property?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
was
conceded,
or
that
was
the
premise
of
the
decision
below,
was
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
it
did--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--just
as
a
matter
of
chronology,
is
it
not
so
that
the
notice
of
lien
was
filed
some
weeks
after
the
property
was
transferred?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say
you
don't
have
to
litigate
that
issue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
would
you
go
back
in
time
with
me
before
there
were
those
later
provisions?
as
i
understand
it,
1346(a)
has
been
with
us
since,
what,
1911?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
other
provisions,
the
subsequent--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
language
of
1346(a)
and
7422
are
matching,
and
neither
or
those
use
the
word
"taxpayer".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
critical
statute
you're
relying
on
is
not
either
one
of
those.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
year
did
that
come
in?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
after
1346(a)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
the
requirement
of
an
administrative
refund
claim,
but
the
time
limit
that
refers
to
the
taxpayer.
the
language
in
7422
of
the
code
and
1346
mesh.
they're
the
same,
and
they
don't
refer
to
any
taxpayer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
always
understood,
that's
hardly
universal.
there's
one
well...
widely
used
verna
and
kafka
litigation
of
federal
tax
controversies
that
states...
this
is
from
the
1986
issue...
that
a
third
party
who
pays
the
taxes
of
another
under
duress
may
recover
the
amount
paid
even
if
the
taxpayer
owes
the
deficiency,
and
in
determining
whether
payment
has
been
made
under
duress,
the
courts
have
examined
the
coercive
circumstances
that
prompted
the
payment
and
the
lack
of
alternatives
available
to
the
payor.
that's
a
widely
used
manual.
it's
certainly
not
authoritative,
because
it
doesn't
come
from
the
government,
but
how
can
you
say
it
was
generally
understood
that
in
light
of
a
statement
like
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
may
very
well
disagree
with
it,
but
you
can't
say
until
this
case,
it
was
generally
understood
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
can
say
it
was
debatable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
just
brought
it
up
because
of
your
statement
that
until
this
case
it
was
generally
understood,
and
i
think
it's
not
generally
understood.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
can
you
tell
us
whether
in
general
it
is
the
practice
of
the
government
to
notify
people
in
this
situation
who
don't
owe
the
tax
but
whose
property
is
going
to
be
subject
to
a
foreclosure
sale
if
they
can't
sell
it,
is
it...
just
like
the
social
security
office
gives
people
notice
of
the
death
benefits
that
they're
entitled
to,
does
the
irs
advise
people
in
these
situations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
my
question
to
you
is,
if
she's
trying
to
avoid...
she
wants
to
sell
the
property
so
she'll
avoid
a
foreclosure.
this
statute
that
you
tell
us
fits
our
situation,
i
asked
if
the
irs
has
a
practice
of
telling
taxpayers
that's
their
remedy.
it's
certainly
phrased
in
highly
discretionary
terms.
there's
nothing
that
requires
the
government...
it
says
the
government
may
do
this
if
it
wants
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
think
of
a
more
discretionary
way
of
saying,
in
the
director's
discretion,
the
district
director
may
in
his
discretion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
based
on
your
knowledge
of
what's
done
in
the
field?
the
district
directors--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--regularly
exercise
their
discretion
to
make
these
agreements?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
hasn't
that
language--
--that's
the
point.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
no,
no,
no,
she's
not
seeking
to
contest
whether
the
husband
owes
the
tax.
she's
seeking
to
contest
only
the
propriety
of
the
lien
on
that
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
assume...
let's
assume
that
the
only
issue
that
she's
bringing
up
is
her
issue,
not
his
issue.
could
she...
let's
just
say,
she
wants
to
ask
for
more.
maybe
she's
not
entitled
to
it.
but
if
all
she
wants
to
contest
is
the
propriety
of
putting
the
lien
on
her
property,
nothing
more,
why
can't
she
use
1346,
the
refund,
1722--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
not
the
simple...
the
simple
point
that
the
wrong
that
was
done
to
her
was
that
a
lien
was
put
on
her
property?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
her
controversy
with
the
government.
her
husband
has
a...
her
ex-husband
has
a
different
controversy.
she
wants
to
litigate
her
controversy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
precedent
of
this
court
set
in
lampf?
you
look
in
the
same
statute
for
the
closest
analogy.
here
we've
got
a
wonderful
statute
we
can
look
at,
6511.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
no
wrongful
levy
here
when
they
never
got
to
the
point
of
making
the
levy.
they
just
put
a
notice--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they
notified
her
of
the
lien.
wasn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--another
statute
that
you
haven't
mentioned,
and
i
wonder
if
you
can
tell
us
how
that
plays
into
it?
you
said
that
there's...
is
there
a
basis
for
a
claim...
6402
provides...
gives
authority
to
make
a
refund.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
doesn't
use
the
word,
taxpayer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
she
has
a
claim
for
a
refund,
and
then
here's
a
substantive
provision
that
says,
the
government
can
give
somebody
a
refund--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
refund
to
the
person
who
made
the
overpayment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
get
all
that
from
6511,
and
then
the
definition
of
taxpayer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
a
case
like
this
one,
where
the
person
who
is
making
the
claim
says,
this
was
my
property.
the
government
came
in
and
slapped
a
lien
on
it.
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
tax,
but
i
need
to
sell
the
property.
do
you
have
any
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
keep
saying...
what
is
the
closest
case
to
this
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right.
there
are
other
circuit
cases
going
the
other
way,
are
there
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
65...
that's
again
the
discretionary
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
your
answer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
jones,
is
your
answer
to
the
chief
in
the
case
of
somebody
who
is
no
relation
to
the
taxpayer
at
all,
just
a
wrong
lien
on
the
wrong
piece
of
property,
that
the
only
remedies
are
a
quiet
title
suit...
by
the
time
that
gets
over
the
foreclosure
has
long
since
occurred...
or
this,
within
his
discretion?
are
those
the
only
two
remedies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
talking
about
a
foreclosure
suit.
i'm
talking
about
somebody
who
wants
to
sell
her
property.
the
government--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
if
the
district
director
says,
in
my
discretion,
no,
then
what
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she's
in
a
hurry.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
of
course
he
does.
the
question
is
whether
she
does
as
well,
and
i'd
like
to
get
a
clear
answer
from
you
on
what
it
is
exactly
that
she
can
contest.
you
assert
that
she
can
contest
the
propriety
of
the
lien
on
her
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
a
footnote
that
she,
as
well,
can
contest
whether
he
ever
owed
the
tax,
and
justice
scalia
pointed
out
that
there's
nothing
in
the
statute,
no
language
in
the
statute
that
would
distinguish
her
contesting
the
lien
on
her
property
as
distinguished
from
her
contesting
the
amount
of
taxes
her
husband
owes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
do
concede
that
you
can't
just
volunteer
to
pay
somebody
else's
tax
and
then
go
litigate
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
not
limiting
your
argument,
then--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
the
coercion
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
disagree,
as
mr.
kent
did,
with
that
manual
that
says
you
can
pay
someone
else's
tax
in
a
situation
of
duress
and
then
sue
for
a
refund,
but
absent
duress,
if
you're
just
a
mere
volunteer,
you
have
no
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
a
case
about
internal-revenue
service
tax
collection.
lori
williams,
a
californian,
paid
under
protest
federal
taxes
she
did
not
owe.
the
internal-revenue
service
had
assessed
these
taxes
against
jerrold
rabin,
once
but
no
longer
williams?s
husband.
williams
paid
the
taxes
to
clear
a
federal
tax
lien
on
the
home
rabin
and
williams
once
co-owned
a
home
transferred
entirely
to
williams
as
part
of
a
property
division
proprietary
to
divorce.
williams
paid
under
protest
so
that
she
could
proceed
with
the
sale
of
her
house,
pursuant
to
a
contract
scheduled
imminently
to
close.
she
then
sought
a
refund,
asserting
that
the
lien
was
invalid,
when
the
internal-revenue
service
denied
her
refund
claim,
she
brought
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
in
california.
in
response
to
williams?s
suit,
the
government
said,
it
did
not
matter
whether
the
government
had
a
right
to
her
money.
her
plea
could
not
be
heard
in
court,
the
government
insisted,
because
refund
suits
could
be
brought
only
by
the
person
against
whom
the
tax
had
been
assessed
here,
williams?s
former
husband.
the
trial
court
accepted
this
argument
but
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
defensive
opinion
among
federal
courts
of
appeals
on
this
question.
may
a
person
not
herself
assessed,
a
tax
who
nevertheless
pays
it
under
protest,
in
order
to
remove
a
tax
lien
from
her
property
to
the
government
for
a
refund.
we
read
the
key
statute
on
refund
actions,
28
u.s.c.
section
1346(a)(1)
to
allow
williams
suit.
that
statute
speaks
of
suits
to
recover
any
internal-revenue
tax
alleged
to
have
been
erroneously
or
illegally
assessed
or
collected.
that
language
we
hold
covers
people
who
pay
taxes
in
the
manner
lori
williams
did.
the
government
relies
on
a
chain
of
other
statutory
provisions
to
impose
a
limitation
on
tax
refund
suits
that
will
leave
williams
without
a
way
to
claim
back
her
payment.
we
do
not
think
congress
ordered
the
confinement
of
recent
fund
suits
urged
by
the
government.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
allowed
lori
williams
to
maintain
her
refund
suits.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
kennedy
and
justice
thomas
joined.
