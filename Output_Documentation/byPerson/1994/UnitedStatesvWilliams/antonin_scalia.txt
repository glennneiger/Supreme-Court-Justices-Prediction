yes,
but
the
statute
does
not
read
that
the
commissioner
shall,
unless
there
is
in
her
judgment
reason
not
to
do
so,
enter
into
such
an
agreement.
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
just
says,
she
may
if
she
wishes.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say,
by
the
taxpayer?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure
we
could.
i
mean,
we
could
make
up
a
whole
new
revenue
code.
where
do
you
get
that
from
the
language?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
language
of
this
thing
either
permits
a
suit
or
it
doesn't
permit
a
suit.
it
doesn't
say
we're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
doesn't
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
to
mrs.
williams.
it
says,
erroneous
collection.
it
could
be
erroneous--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
they
moved
against
the
wrong
person,
it
could
be
erroneous
because
the
tax
wasn't
due.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so
there
you
are.
you're
in
the
soup,
and
anybody,
even
though
your
client
may
not
have
wanted
it,
somebody
else
can
come
in
and
try
to
litigate
whether
the
tax
was
actually
owed
by
her
husband.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
client.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
client.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
client
has
paid
the
tax.
it's
the
government
that's
trying
to
say
taxpayer
means
only
the
individual
who
assertedly
owed
the
tax.
