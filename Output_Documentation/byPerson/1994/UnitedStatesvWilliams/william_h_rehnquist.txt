chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-395,
united
states
v.
lori
williams.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
jones,
1346
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
district
courts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
traditionally,
in
cases
like
testan,
we've
said
that
simply
conferring
jurisdiction
is
not
enough.
there
must
be
a
grant
of
some
sort
of
cause
of
action--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--to
waive
sovereign
immunity.
where
do
we
find
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
appears
just
to
be
a
statute
of
limitations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(f).
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
made
mr.
helvering
famous.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
has
been
the
basis
of
those
courts'
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but
where
in
that
complicated
structure
do
they
derive
the
principle
that
a
nontaxpayer
can't
sue?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
7422(a)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
far
we
have
no
limitation
to
taxpayers,
either
in
1346
or
7422.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
again,
the
statute
doesn't
limit
that
to
taxpayers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
6511
does?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
ask...
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
before
your
time
expires.
what
about
where
the
irs
simply
mistakes
the
property
that
it
has
a
right
to
lien?
it
says,
the
lien
is
on
lot
2
and
it's
really
on
lot
3.
what
remedy
does
the
owner
of
lot
2
have?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
lot
2
has
no
connection--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--with
the
tax
liability.
the
irs
simply
makes
a
mistake
in
the
legal
description.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
you're
going
to
have
a
particularly...
a
curmudgeon,
who's
the
irs--
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
by
itself
doesn't--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--tell
us
much
of
anything
as
to
what
might
have
been
triable
issues
of
fact.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
this
go
up
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
it
was
a
trial
on
stipulated
facts
because
the
parties
stipulated
that
there
were
no
triable
issues
of
fact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
quite
remarkable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
panitz,
as
i
understand
the
government's
reasoning,
it's
that
7422
says
that
no
suit
shall
be
maintained
until
you've
filed
for
a
refund,
and
6511
says
that
the
claim
for
credit
on
the...
under
the
refund
section
must...
shall
be
made
by
the
taxpayer.
now,
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
it
really
is
a
keystone...
i
mean,
if
you
have
to
do
this
in
order
to
bring
a
suit
for
refund,
and
if
to
do
it
you
have
to
be
a
taxpayer,
perhaps
that
is
its
effect.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
7422
says
that
must
be
complied
with
before
you
bring
a
suit
for
refund.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
nobody
ever
claimed
the
tax
laws
were
equitable.
[laughter]
i
mean,
they're
fairly
strict.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
panitz--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--a
moment
ago
you
said
that,
i
believe,
6532
could
be
relied
on
to
file...
for
filing
the
claim,
you
didn't
have
to
rely
on
6511,
and
that
6532
didn't
mention
the
word
"taxpayer".
6632
does
use
the
term,
"taxpayer".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
it
refers
to
the
claim
by
the
taxpayer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
let
me
read
you
the
last
three
or
four
lines
of
6532.
it
talks
about
2
years
from
the
date
of
mailing
by
certified
letter
by
the
secretary
to
the
taxpayer,
so
that
your
suggestion
there's
an
alternate
way
of
coming,
you
don't
need
to
rely
on
6511,
which
uses
the
term,
"taxpayer",
your
section
that
you
rely
on
also
uses
the
term,
"taxpayer".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
okay.
what
is
it
that
enables
you
to
file
a
claim
for
refund,
as
section
7422
does,
that
doesn't
require
that
the
claim
for
refund
be
filed
by
the
taxpayer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
tell
me
what
section.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
give
me
a
number?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
you
say
perhaps
the
word
taxpayer
should
have
a
different
definition
than
the
person
who
paid
the
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
would
seem...
i
mean,
that
doesn't
seem
terribly
difficult
to
define
taxpayer
as
the
person
who
paid
the
tax.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
client
paid
the
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
asked
you
a
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
your
client
pay
the
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
panitz.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
94-395,
united
states
against
williams
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
