justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
doesn't
override,
it,
but
the
point
is,
the
mere
fact
that
your
statute
says
appeals
is
not
contradicted
by,
or
a
limited
reading
of
that
statute
is
not
contradicted
by
518(a),
which
goes
out
of
its
way
to
say,
not
just
appeals,
but
the
attorney
general
represents
the
united
states
in
suits
and
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
looking
at
it.
i'm
reading
518(a),
and
i'm
reading
9010,
and
what
do
you
do
about
9040,
which
was
enacted
at
the
same
time
as
the
statute
you're
relying
upon,
which
does
say
the
commission
is
authorized
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
to
appeal
from
and
to
petition
the
supreme
court
for
certiorari
to
review
judgments
or
decrees
entered
with
respect
to
actions
in
which
it
is
presumed
to
be
provided
in
this
section,
which
is
not
the
present
section.
there
it
goes
out
of
its
way
to
say,
not
only
appeal,
but
to
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
not
passed
at
that
time?
it
was
not
reenacted?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
it
was
originally
reenacted,
just
reenacted.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
2
years
can
go
by,
and
we
really
don't
know
whether
the
case
is
here
or
not
until
the
attorney
general
chooses
to
retroactively
give
life
to
the
suit?
that
doesn't
seem...
it's
very
strange
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
at
least
there's
that
deadline.
after
we've
ruled
on
the
petition,
and
we
rule
that
the
agency
is
not
properly
represented,
the
attorney
general
at
that
point
cannot
give
life
to
the
suit,
right,
but
any
time
up
to
then,
we
really
don't
know
until
he
speaks
whether
the
suit
is
properly
here
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
sort
of
a
de
facto
authority
doctrine,
you
might
say.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
these
members
do
participate
in
the
discussion,
though,
and
they
say...
i
mean,
they
can
say,
well,
you're
making
a
good
point
but
it
seems
to
me
that
point
is
refuted
by
thus-and-such,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well,
my...
you
know,
judges,
when
they
are
recused
from
a
case,
consider
themselves
recused
not
just
from
voting
in
the
decision,
but
from
participating
in
the
discussion,
because
that
is...
that
is
part
of
the
action
of
any
body,
the
discussion
which
leads
to
the
decision,
and
when
you're
out
of
the
case,
you're
out
of
it
for
the
discussion,
not
only
for
the
vote.
why
isn't
a
similar
rule
an
appropriate
one
for
deliberations
of
an
executive
agency?
if
you
ought
to
be
out,
you
ought
to
be
out.
you
shouldn't
influence
the
decision.
not
just
not
vote
on
it,
you
shouldn't
influence
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
wait
a
minute.
now
you've
confused
me.
you've
been
talking
up
to
now
about
independent
agencies.
i
thought
you
were
using
that
to
mean
the
fourth
branch
of
government,
the
headless
fourth
branch,
just
those
agencies
that
are
not
subject
to
the
president.
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
now
your
example
about
the
advisory
committee
act,
that
applies
to
all
agencies,
not
just
independent
agencies.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
a
quite
different
line,
the
line
between
the
office
of
the
president
and
the
rest
of
the
government.
is
that
the
line
you're
relying
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
i
agree
with
you.
we
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
congress
putting
listeners
into
the
office
of
the
president,
but
what
about
their
putting
listeners
into
all
other
agencies,
including
the
defense
department,
interior,
whatever?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
really
wouldn't
know
until
they
try
them
one-by-one,
agency-by-agency,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
when
they
get
here,
you
urge
that
we
not
apply
the
rule
in
the
first
case,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
leave
me
defenseless
when
you
talk
about
the
sentencing
commission.
[laughter]
i
just
wanted
to
get
specific
with
the
question
that's
been
asked
down
there
a
couple
of
times.
forgetting
the
law
for
a
second,
just
thinking
totally
practically,
i
can
imagine
how
having
a
congressman
sitting
up
at
the
bench
here
might
cause
a
little
problem.
i
mean,
you'd
be
a
little
nervous
about
it,
and
in
the
conference
it
would
be
tougher
to
carry
out
our
job.
i
can
understand
that.
thinking
in
those
practical
terms,
what
happens
when
the
fec
makes
the
prosecutorial
decision,
we
will
prosecute
x,
or
we
won't.
is
the
congressional
representative
sitting
in
the
room?
is,
are
there
other
members
of
the
public
in
the
room?
is
the
congressional
representative
formally
or
informally...
i
mean,
what
happens?
is
he
interfering
in
some
way,
as
a
practical
matter,
with
the
ability
of
the
regular
members
to
make
up
their
own
minds
independently
about
whom
to
prosecute?
is
he
interfering
in
a
way
that's
different
from
what
the
ordinary
citizen
might
interfere?
does
he
only
appear
at
public
meetings?
are
there
private
meetings
where
he
appears
but
the
others
don't?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
a
sense
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
courts
of
appeals
you're
saying
that
they
are
invalid?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
valid
because
the
u.s.
attorneys
have
authorization
to
proceed
immediately,
without
the
prior
consent
of
the
solicitor
general,
so
they
have
authorization.
you're
saying
the
practice
of
the
justice
department
is
to
give
them
authorization
to
file
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
have
you
given
the
fec
authorization
to
file
petitions
for
certiorari?
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
it's
not
a
parallel
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
a
person
reasonably
believes
he
is
an
agent,
he
is
an
agent?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
this
have
been
a
declaratory
judgment?
i
thought...
i
thought
that
this
respondent
was
prosecuted
for
a
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
buckley
holds
that
if
it's
made
in
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
you
don't
issue
an
immediate...
but
it...
i
don't
know
that
buckley
holds
that
it
should
be
brought,
it
must
be
brought
in
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they're
not
really
the
executive
branch,
is
the
reason
for
that,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
they
are
the
fourth
branch.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
as
though,
if
the
president
objected
to
it
they
would
stand
up
and
assert
the
chief
executive's
prerogatives,
would
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
as
though,
if
the
president
objected
to
it,
the
members
of
the
federal
election
commission
would
stand
up
and
assert
the
president's
prerogatives
on
his
behalf.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
go
this...
you're
not
fighting
the
lost
battle
of
the
headless
fourth
branch.
i
gather
your
point
just
is
that
it's
worse
to
have
congress
install
some
of
its
agents
in
an
independent
agency
than
it
is
to
have
congress
install
some
of
its
agents
in
an
agency
that
the
president
at
least
has
control
over.
that's
the
only
point
you're
making--
justice
antonin
scalia
they
get
paid
for
being
agents
of
congress,
which
is
what
they
are
in
this
capacity.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cooper--
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
you
going
to
address
retroactivity?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
their
acts
are
invalid?
i
thought
it
simply
had
to
do
with
whether
the
statute
continues
to
subsist
as
an
operational
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can
cut
out
a
piece
of
the
statute
and
let
the
rest
continue
to
operate,
as
opposed
to
saying
the
whole
statute's
null
and
void.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
speak
to
operational...
operations
at
all.
