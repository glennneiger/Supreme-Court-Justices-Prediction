chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
number
93-1151,
federal
election
commission
v.
nra
political
victory
fund,
et
al.--
mr.
noble.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
other
agencies
have
the
authority
to
petition
here
without
the
s.g.?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
other
agencies,
or
how
many
agencies,
perhaps
i
should
say,
have
the
authority
to
petition
here
without
the
s.g.?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
what
the
other
agencies
are
that
you
think
have
that
authority?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
can
certainly
sit
in
on
all
the
discussions
of
the
commission,
can't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
might
not
those
discussions
be
less
than
full
and
frank
in
the
presence
of
those
two
congressional
representatives?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
the
freedom
of
information
act
would
authorize
the
release
of
the
private
deliberations
of
the
commission?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
noble.
mr.
bender,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
perhaps
you
might
touch
briefly
on
the
de
facto
matter
which
you,
i
believe
you
argue
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now,
is
that
the
same
sort
of
statutory
situation
that
you
have
in
petitions
to
this
court?
2--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
a
u.s.
attorney
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals,
you
say
that
notice
of
appeal
would
be,
not
be
any
good
so
far
as
the
court
was
concerned,
unless
the
s.g.
approved
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
say
that
about
any
agency
coming
here
without
the
approval,
that
there
was
no
unfairness
because
the
respondent
knew
that
the
agency
was
filing
a
petition
for
certiorari,
but
that
doesn't
get
you
over
the
hurdle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
in
buckley,
the
thing
was
just
a
declaratory
judgment,
so
the
mandate
was
really
meaningless
anyway.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
refer
to
it
as
a
technical
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
really
seems
quite
a
weird
result,
that
you
can
be
proceeded
against
by
an
agency
that
is
totally
improperly
constituted
but
you
can't
raise
that
as
a
defense
to
the
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
can
see
how
you'd
say
that,
some
sort
of
de
facto
theory
that
these
six
people
who
are
concededly
present
and
functioning,
and
properly
so,
would
have
done
exactly
the
same
thing,
but
it
seems
to
me
when
you
say
the...
you
can't
even
make
the
argument
in
an
enforcement
proceeding,
that
that's
rather
extreme.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bender.
mr.
cooper,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
members
of
the...
the
voting
members
of
the
commission
are
appointed
by
the
president,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why
would
one
say
this
is
out
of
the
control
of
the
president?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
ftc?
i
mean,
there
you
have
to
have
removal
for
cause--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--as
i
recall,
and
yet
surely
the
ftc
enforces...
is
a
law
enforcement
agency.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
humphrey's
executor,
the
case
that
held
that
fdr
could
not
remove
a
member
of
the
ftc
at
will?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
part
of
your
argument,
too,
that
congress
has
selected
a
and
b
and
said
you're
going
to
do
this,
rather
than
speaking
for
a
general
class,
say,
a
public
member,
and
saying
the
president
may
appoint
a
member
of
the
public?
that
would
be
better
for
the
constitutionality,
i
take
it,
of
your...
than
for
the
congress
to
say
xy
is
going
to
be
the
public
member?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
this
disqualify
it?
i
mean,
you've
got
six
people,
and
they
were
the
only
six
people
who
could
vote,
and
they're
clearly
all
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
are
you
relying
on
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
think
of
a
facial
attack
as
being
associated
with
the
first
amendment.
other
than
that,
to
talk
about
something
being
void
or
invalid
and
something
like
that,
it's
not
always
that
clear
that
it's
totally
across
the
board.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
you
can
answer
the
question,
mr.--
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cooper.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
number
93-1151,
the
federal
election
commission
versus
the
nra
political
victory
fund.
the
federal
election
commission
was
created
by
congress
to
oversee
the
enforcement
of
various
laws
regulating
the
financing
of
political
campaigns.
it
bought
an
action
against
the
respondent
to
enforce
a
provision
of
the
federal
election
campaign
act.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
columbia
circuit
held
that
the
presence
on
the
commission
of
two
non-voting
congressional
representatives
violated
the
separation
of
powers
principle
of
the
constitution
and
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
said
the
federal
election
commission
could
not
have
the
order
enforced.
the
commission
in
its
own
name
filed
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court
two
days
before
the
expiration
of
the
90-day
filing
period
for
that
sort
of
a
petition
mandated
by
law.
the
solicitor
general
several
months
later
authorized
the
commission
petition
for
a
certiorari.
we
don't
reach
the
merits
of
the
commission's
claims
but
instead
dismiss
the
commission
petition
for
a
certiorari
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
congress
is
by
statute
concentrated
the
authority
to
litigate
for
the
government
in
this
court
in
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general.
while
congress
may
of
course
exempt
by
statute
particular
agencies
from
this
requirement.
we
hold
that
the
relevant
statutes
in
this
case
do
not
constitute
such
an
exemption
and
we
further
hold
that
the
attempted
ratification
of
the
commission's
petition
by
the
solicitor
general
is
unavailing
because
the
solicitor
general
may
not
retroactively
authorize
untimely
agency
petitions.
to
hold
otherwise
we
give
that
official
unilateral
power
to
extend
the
90-day
statutory
filing
period
by
weeks
or
even
months
and
thereby
really
blur
of
the
jurisdictional
deadline.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
ginsburg
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
