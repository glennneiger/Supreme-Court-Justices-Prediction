may
i
ask
you
two
very
brief
questions?
do
these
commissioners
get
paid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
their
duty,
in
addition
to
their
salaries
with
congress?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
paid
for
their
services
on
the
commission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
are
their
responsibilities,
if
any?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
a
difference,
mr.
cooper.
i
suppose
that
ex
officio
members
on
this
court
would
invade
our
independent
authority,
but
your
theory
is
a
little
different,
i
think.
your
theory
is
one
of
aggrandizement,
that
the
congress
is
aggrandizing
itself
or
enhancing
its
own
powers
by
putting
its
people
on
another
branch.
it
seems
to
me
the
theory
is
different
in
the
two
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
to
the
invasion
point,
it
seems
to
me
rather
clear
that
we
would
react
rather
promptly
if
somebody
said
somebody's
going
to
sit
on
our
conferences,
and
it's
interesting
to
me
that
for
some
20
years
or
so,
the
fec
doesn't
seem
to
have
been
bothered
at
all
by
the
presence
of
these
members.
nobody
ever
complained
about
it,
did
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
was
going
to
ask
you
if
you
would
take
the
same
view
if
the
two
individuals
were
not
actually
agents
of
congress
but
rather
the
statute
in
effect
had
designated
a
public
member
to
sit
in
on
all
meetings
for
information
purposes
and
periodically
report
to
congress.
would
that
be
subject
to
the
same
attack?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
that
would--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
you'd
say
that
would
violate
the
appointments
clause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
you
let
the
president
appoint
that
public
member,
a
member
to
be
appointed
by
the
president
to
perform
this
function
of
advising
congress
and
passing
messages
from
congress
to
the
commission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
the
fact
that
the
two
individuals
are
actual
officials
of
congress
that
are
critical
to
your
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
case
that
runs
through
my
mind
is
the
problem
congress
might
have,
say,
with
the
cia,
some
agency
that
doesn't
make
its
deliberations
public,
but
nevertheless
congress
wants
to
know
what
goes
on.
does
congress
have
the
power
to
appoint
either
a
public
member,
or
maybe
one
of
its
agents,
to
sit
in
on
all
policy
discussions
of
the
cia
as
a
method
of
keeping
itself
informed
about
sensitive
national
security
matters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
it's
just
for
the
purpose
of
informing.
of
course,
they
could
perform
some
influence.
one
of
the
things
that
puzzles
me
about
this
case
is,
i
don't
know
what
these
two
people
really
do
that
has
that
much
significance
to
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nobody
seems
to
have
complained
for
20
years.
that's
the
puzzling
thing.
i
would
think
somebody
would
have
been
unhappy
with
them
if
it
was
a
serious
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
except
paid,
i
guess,
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
what
they
do.
