mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
issues:
first,
whether
congress
violated
the
constitution's
requirement
of
separation
of
powers
when
it
appointed
the
secretary
of
the
senate
and
the
clerk
of
the
house
as
nonvoting
ex
officio
members
of
the
federal
election
commission
where
all
the
decisions
of
the
commission
are
made
by
six
voting
members
who
are
appointed
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate,
pursuant
to
article
ii.
the
second
issue
is
whether,
if
the
fec
is
unconstitutional,
whether
the
actions
taken
prior
to
the
court's
decision
should
be
afforded
the
fact
of
validity
as
was
done
some
18
years
ago
in
buckley
v.
valeo.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit
applied
a
bright
line
rule
to
the
separation
of
powers
analysis
and
effectively
said
that
the
mere
presence
of
nonvoting,
ex
officio
agents
of
congress
on
an
independent
agency
of
the
executive
branch
was
a
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers.
after
doing
so,
the
court
declined
to
apply
the
precedent
of
buckley
v.
valeo,
and
felt
that
because
this
was
a
defense
to
an
enforcement
action
it
must
give
the
national
rifle
association
some
relief,
and
therefore
reversed
the
district
court's
finding
of
a
violation
of
the
federal
election
campaign
act.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
on
both
issues.
the
court's--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--if
the
court
wishes,
i
can
address
that
issue.
the
federal
election
commission
was
created
in
the
wake
of
watergate
to
be
independent
of
the
department
of
justice.
the
statute
itself
talks
in
terms
of
the
federal
election
commission
having
independent
authority
to
institute
actions
and
to
conduct
appeals
of
cases
under
title
ii.
the
solicitor
general's
position
on
this
relies
on
a
narrow
reading
of
the
word
appeal
to
not
include
petitions
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
you
could
give
effect
to
both
those
statutes,
though
i
think
that
would
not
be
giving
full
effect
to
the
intent
of
congress
in
establishing
the
federal
election
commission.
first,
i
would
note
that
518(a)
also
talks
about
the
solicitor
general's
authority
to
appeal,
and
does
not
specifically
mention
petitions
for
writ
of
certiorari,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that's
a
congressional
grant
of
authority,
and
that
congress
can
limit
that
authority
in
specific
instances.
here,
where
you
have--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--as
a
general
proposition,
absent
some
other
declaration
by
congress
that
litigation
authority
should
reside
in
another
agency,
yes,
i
think
that
does
cover
it.
but
in
our
instance,
we
have
a
situation
where
congress
clearly
intended
the
federal
election
commission
to
be
independent
of
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
the
word
appeal
generally
comprehends
writs
of
certiorari.
the
word
appeal
is
also
used
in
our
statute
in
title
ii
authorizing
the
commission
to
conduct
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
yes,
but
while
that's
a
general
grant
of
authority
to
the
solicitor
general,
we
don't
believe
that
it
overrides
the
congressional...
the
words
of
the
statute
and
also
the
congressional
intent
to
afford
the
commission
its
own
litigation
authority.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
yes,
justice
scalia,
but
again
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
intent
of
congress,
the
way
the
statute's
constructed,
also--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--that
provision
was
not
enacted
at
the
same
time
as
the
federal
election
campaign
act.
in
fact,
that
provision
came
into
being
in
1971,
prior
to
the
commission
even
being
created,
and
then
what
happened
in
1974
when
the
commission
was
created,
that
statute
was
just
modified
to
substitute
the
commission
for
the
comptroller
general,
and
we
don't
think
that
congress
had
any
intent
in
doing
that.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
it
was
reenacted,
but
there
was
no--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--and
it
was
not...
it
was
not
in
any
way
substantially
redrafted.
they
just
substituted,
effectively,
the
fec
for
the
comptroller
general,
so
in
effect
what
you
have
is
two
statutes
created
at
two
different
times,
and
they
were
originally
created
for
two
different
agencies,
and
so
we
think
that
the
looking
at
title
26
as
a
proscription
on
title
2
authority
is
inappropriate
in
this
situation.
also,
though--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--excuse
me,
i'm--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--i'm
aware
of...
there...
i'm
not
specifically
sure.
i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
other
agencies,
and
there
are
situations
where
agencies
have
voluntarily
given,
or
ceded
authority
to
the
s.g.
to
petition
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
i
think
the
international
trade
commission
has
that
authority.
beyond
that,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
i
don't
know
that
it
has
the
same
exact
language,
and
it
clearly
does
not
have
the
same
legislative
history
with
regard
to
the
intent
of
the
federal
election
commission
to
be
independent
of
the
department
of
justice.
if
i
can
address
for
a
moment
the
question
of
title
26,
and
how...
the
reading
that
title
26
gives
the
fec
authority
while
title
2
does
not
would
result
in
what
we
consider
a
conflicting
scheme,
because
under
title
26
and
under
title
2,
the
federal
election
commission
can
bring
suits
for
injunctive
relief
for
violations
of
the
public
financing
statutes.
and
under
the
solicitor
general's
position,
we
would
have
a
situation
that
if
the
fec
cited
title
2,
the
solicitor
general
would
have
authority
in
the
supreme
court,
if
the
fec
cited
title
26
as
its
authority,
the
fec
would
have
authority
in
the
supreme
court,
and
if
the
sec...
if
the
fec,
as
is
probably
most
likely,
would
cite
both
statutory
sections,
then
you
would
have
conflicting
authority
in
the
supreme
court,
and
we
suggest
that
that
is
not
the
scheme
that
congress
intended.
the...
what
runs
throughout
our
statute,
the
creation
of
our
statute,
was
the
idea
that
the
federal
election
commission
confined
itself
in
litigation
involved
with
a
sitting
president,
or
a
sitting
president's
opponent,
and
that
there
should
be
independence
from
the
department
of
justice,
from
the
attorney
general.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
yes.
the
petition
was
clearly
filed
within
time.
there
is
nothing
that
we
read
in
518(a)
that
puts
a
time
limit
on
when
the
solicitor
general
can
authorize
a
petition
to
be
filed,
and
i
think
the
solicitor
general
would
be
in
a
better
position
to
speak
to
that
issue,
but
we
don't
see
anything,
and
nothing's
been
cited
that
would
limit
the
solicitor
general's
authority
to
authorize
the
petition.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
well,
i
don't
think
you
would
have
a
situation,
because
the
court
would
rule
on
the
petition,
presumably,
before
that
point,
but
i
don't
think
that's
a
situation--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--i...
that
is
a
possibility.
that
is
not
the
situation
you
have
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
well,
i...
that
would
end
it.
i
think
one
of
the
problems
you
have
in
this
case
is
that
for
approximately
18
years
the
federal
election
commission
has
exercised
what
i
think
many
presumed
was
its
own
independent
litigating
authority,
so
there
was
no
question
in
this
case
earlier
on
that...
whether
we
had
the
authority,
and
no
previous
solicitor
general
has
ever
raised
an
objection,
so
i
think
everybody
just
assumed
that
the
federal
election
commission
did,
in
fact,
have
the
authority.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
yes.
if
i
may
move
on
to
the
first
substantive
issue
in
the
case,
the
court's
application
of
the
bright
line
test
is
contrary
to
the
functional
analysis
that
this
court
has
used
with
regard
to
separation
of
powers
cases,
and
that
functional
analysis
requires
the
court
to
look
at
whether
or
not
there
has
been
aggrandizement
of
power
by
one
branch,
or
interference
with
the
exercise
of
power
by
another
branch.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
threshold
question:
do
the
ex
officios
exercise
any
power?
the
statute
itself
provides
that
the
ex
officio
members
of
the
commission
have
no
vote
on
the
commission.
all
decisions
are
made
by
the
six
voting
members
of
the
commission,
so
as
a
threshold
matter
you
have
no
direct
exercise
of
power.
but
moving
on
to
see
what
else
the
ex
officios
can
do,
the
statute
provides
that
they
can
neither
be
chair
nor
vice
chair
of
the
commission
and,
moving
beyond
that,
the
commission's
rules
of
procedure
provide
that
they
cannot
serve
for
purposes
of
a
quorum,
they
cannot
vote
to
adjourn,
they
cannot
select
the
presiding
officer--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
whatever
influence
they
would
have
to
chill
the
discussions
would
be
very
minimal,
considering
the
fact
that
this
agency,
as
all
agencies,
works
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
the
sunshine
act,
the
federal
advisory
committee
act,
so
the
commissioners
do
not
sit
at
a
meeting
with
an
understanding
that
what
they
say
will
forever
be
secret.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
not
until
an
enforcement
action
is
over.
by
statute,
within
our
statute,
there
is
a
provision
that
makes
enforcement
actions
confidential
during
their
pendency.
that
provision
applies
to
the
ex
officio
members
as
well
as
it
applies
to
the
commissioners
and
the
staff.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
yes.
they're
taped.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
they
are
taped.
the
tapes
are
then
made
public
and
are
then
released,
with
few
exceptions
dealing
mainly
with
settlement
discussions.
they
are
then
publicly
released
upon
request.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
yes,
justice
scalia,
they
do
participate
in
the
discussion,
but
that's
all
they
can
do.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
the
rules
regarding
recusal
are
different
rules,
and
the
ex
officio
members
may
very
well
end
up
recusing
themselves
from
specific
cases,
but
here
you're
not
dealing
with
a
question
of
interest
in
the
case
that
would
require
recusal.
rather,
what
you're
dealing
with
is
a
question
of,
is
it
some
leverage
or
some
coercion
of
power
that
they're
exercising
on
the
commission?
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
no,
justice
o'connor,
we
think
that
that
proposition
is
really
based
on
an
untenable
proposition
by
the
respondents,
which
is
that
what
is
good
for
an
independent
agency
created
by
congress
and
placed
in
the
executive
branch
by
necessity
is
good
for
this
court
or
the
president.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
yes.
yes,
i
think
it
would
interfere...
it
would
also
directly
interfere
with
this
court's
article
iii
powers.
it
is
the
same
analysis,
the
same
function--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--because--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--because
the
same
rights
that
attach
to
either
the
president
or
this
court
do
not
necessarily
attach
to
independent
agencies.
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--yes,
in
large
part.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
no.
i
would
say
all,
it
would
apply
to
all--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--but
you
would
still
have
to
look
at
whether
or
not
it
interfered
with
the
courts'
article
iii
powers.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
in
the
sense
that
the
constitution
gives
article
iii
courts
strong
protection
against
partisan
or
political
influence.
you
have
lifetime
tenure,
without
diminution
in
pay...
those
are
not
the
same
type--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--but
still
the...
it
is
not
the...
the
court
derives
its
power
directly
from
article
iii.
we
are
a
creature
of
congress.
we
are
an
agency
that
was
created
by
congress
for
a
specific
purpose.
the
analysis
that
would
say
that--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--clearly,
the
one
mentioned
before
about
the
potential
of
a
chill,
because
this
court's
deliberations
are
not
subject
to
the
freedom
of
information
act,
are
not
subject
to
the
sunshine--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--because
i
think
it
would
still
be
considered
a
direct
interference
with
the
court's
article
iii
powers.
it
is
not...
again,
the
freedom
of
information
act--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--well,
i...
if
you
cannot
draw
the
line,
then
i
think
there
would
also
be
a
problem
with
the
application
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
the
sunshine
act
to
independent
agencies,
because
clearly
the
courts
have
gone
out
of
their
way
to
not
apply,
for
example,
the
federal
advisory
committee
act
to
the
office
of
the
president,
saying
that
to
do
so
would
raise
serious
constitutional
doubts
about
the
federal
advisory
committee
act,
but
when
you
get
to
applying
it
to
independent
agencies,
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
act
can
be
applied,
because--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
correct,
but
it
would
not
apply
to
the
office
of
the
president.
all
i'm
suggesting
there
is
that--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--i'm...
i'm
relying
on
several
lines,
yes.
that
is
one
clear
line.
the
difference
between
the
office
of
the
president
and
also
with
this
court,
or
article
iii
courts.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
each
one
would
have
to
be
analyzed
on
a
functional
approach,
and
i
would
start
with
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
distinction
with
the
federal
election
commission
that
may
not
exist
with
other
agencies,
and
that
is
that
the
federal
election
commission
deals
in
an
area
of
law
that
directly
interrelates
with
how
congress
acts.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
well,
i
think
each
one--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--i'm
only
urging
it
with
regard
to
the
federal
election
commission.
as
you
approach
each
case,
i
think
you'd
have
to
look
at
it
with
a
functional
analysis.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
the
ex
officio
members?
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
no.
my
understanding
is
that
they
get
paid
by
congress,
and
that
is
what...
well,
the...
what
we
have
is
designees.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
not
that
i'm
aware
of
separately
from
their
other
services.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
the
responsibilities
do
not
appear
in
the
statute,
but
pursuant
to
the
legislative
history
the
responsibilities
were
to
act
as
an
advisory
and
liaison
function
for
the
commission.
i
would
also
note
that,
even
today,
the
clerk
of
the
house
and
the
secretary
of
the
senate
have...
receive
all
reports
for
candidates
for
those
bodies,
and
then
have
to
submit
those
reports
to
the
fec,
so
there
is
a
clear
overlap
between
the
authority
of
the
fec
and,
while
the
fec
has
to
independently
exercise
that
authority,
congress
believed
that
the
fec
would
be
served
by
the
advice
of
the
ex
officio
members.
so
i
think
that
is...
also
in
partial
response
to
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
is
a
distinction
that
may
very
well
exist.
i
think
while
the
court
did
not
specifically
reach
the
question
of
the
attorney
general
as
ex
officio
member
on
the
sentencing
commission,
i
think
the
same
type
of
analysis
would
apply
there.
there
is
no
power,
direct
power,
and
the
attorney
general
brings
a
certain
amount
of
expertise
to
the
sentencing
commission,
so
i
think
that
you
may
very
well
have
the
same
type
of
analysis
in
that
situation.
if
i
may
briefly
turn
to
the--
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
--the
ex
officio
members
are
able
to
appear
to
participate
in
the
executive
sessions
where
administrative
investigations
are
discussed,
and
members
of
the
public
are
not
allowed
to
appear
in
those
sessions.
however,
as
a
practical
matter,
their
influence
is
really
limited
to
the
ability
to
give
advice.
the
statute
puts
no
burden
on
the
agency
to
follow
that
advice,
to
explain
why
it's
not
following
that
advice;
it
doesn't
require
the
agency
to
delay
a
decision
if
the
commissioners,
voting
commissioners
disagree
with
the
ex
officio
members.
unlike
some
other
statutes
that
the
lower
court
have
upheld,
there
is
no
leverage
that
the
ex
officios
have,
other
than
the
leverage
that
exists
with
this
agency
and
every
agency,
which
is
the
leverage
of
oversight.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
they
are
part
of
the
deliberative
process.
i
would
not
say
they're
part
of
the
decisional
process
in
the
same
sense
that
when
the
time
comes
to
make
that
decision,
what
is
very,
what
is
as
a
practical
matter
very
clear
to
everybody
is
that
they
have
no
vote,
because
when
the
motion
is
called...
and
they
cannot
make
the
motion.
when
the
motion
is
called,
they
are
silent
at
that
point.
they
cannot
vote,
and
i
would
say
whatever
weight
is
carried
by
the
ex
officio
members
having
the
right
to
speak
is
overridden
by
the
fact
that
they
have
absolutely
no
vote,
and
also
the
fact
that
we
are
subject,
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
noted,
to
normal
oversight,
and
the...
which
can
include
hearings,
can
include
private
meetings
with
commissioners,
and
all
of
that
is
much
more...
has
much
more
weight
on
an
agency,
on
every
agency,
than
just
the
sitting
of
the
ex
officio
members.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
no.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
no,
but...
but
that
doesn't
really...
is
not
necessarily
a
function
of
sitting
at
the
table.
mr.
lawrence
m.
noble
yes.
there
is
that
opportunity,
but
again,
i
think
that
opportunity
pales
in
comparison
to
the
opportunity,
when
the
tapes
are
made
public,
for
congress
in
oversight
functions
to
see
what
the
agency
has
done.
as
a
practical
matter,
all
they
can
do
is
say
what
they
think,
and
that's
where
it
stops.
what
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
say
is
that
in
terms
of
the
remedy
involved
in
this
case,
make
two
very
quick
points.
one
is
that
what
we're
asking
for
is
the
application
of
buckley
v.
valeo,
and
to
find
that
the
agency
was,
in
fact...
all
the
actions
of
the
agency
were,
in
fact,
de
facto
valid,
and
second,
that
we
wanted
to
point
out
that
contrary
to
the
nra's
position,
there
is
a
remedy
in
this
case.
