mr.
charles
j.
cooper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
should
like
to
speak
only
for
a
moment
on
the
jurisdictional
question
that
the
court
has
discussed.
our
position
is
this
case
is
jot
and,
mr.
justice
scalia,
i
think
your
point
regarding
this
issue
going
away
if
the
court
rules
on
the
cert
petition
is
not
the
case,
because
in
this
case
the
court
ruled
on
the
cert
petition
and
granted
it,
and
obviously
the
issue
is
still
here.
the
issue
is
a
jurisdictional
one.
the
solicitor
general
says
that
he
can
retroactively
approve
a
cert
petition
filed
by
the
federal
election
commission,
says
that
is
like
a
protective
notice
of
appeal.
i
think,
justice
scalia,
your
points
were
right
on
target
in
that
regard.
my
own
experience
is
there's
never
been
a
protective
notice
of
appeal
filed
without
the
solicitor
general's
approval.
the
point,
your
honor,
again
is
this
case
is
jurisdictionally
out
of
time.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
justice
breyer,
it
was
given
outside
of
the
60-day
period
of
time,
so
there's
no
understanding
of
the
time
limits
of
this
court,
of
which
i
am
aware
anyway,
that
would
bring
the
authorized
petition
within
the
time
limits
of
this
court,
so
if
it
is...
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction,
it
must
be
because
the
solicitor
general
is
empowered
after
the
fact
to
authorize
the
petition.
and
of
course
if...
in
this
case
it
would
mean
that
the
solicitor
general
has
the
power
to
decide
not
to
authorize
it
and
to
pull
this
case
from
this
court's
docket
by
his
own
unilateral
action.
we
don't
think
that
is
within
the
solicitor
general's
authority.
moving
now
to
the
merits
of
the
ex
officio
point,
your
honor,
i
think
that
counsel
for
the
commission's
concession
that
ex
officio
members
on
this
court
disposes
of
this
case,
the--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
actually
our
theory
is
both
that
congress
is
invading
the
executive's
domain,
and
it
is
doing
so
in
a
way
that
aggrandizes
its
own,
so
i
believe
we
have
the
benefit
of
all
of
this
court's
separation
of
powers
jurisprudence.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
your
honor,
they
were
certainly
forewarned
by
the
ford
administration
that,
were
the
ex
officio's
retained
in
the
statute,
that
that
would
be
an
unconstitutional
invasion
of
the
executive
branch.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--excuse
me?
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
it
is
not
at
all
like
that,
and
in
fact
that
brings
this
ex
officio
issue
into
a
very
sharp
focus.
this...
placing
ex
officio
members
on
an
independent
agency,
so-called,
is
doubly
unconstitutional.
it
goes
beyond
just
placing
them,
for
example,
at
the
president's
cabinet
table.
counsel
for
the
election
commission
throughout
their
briefs
have
made
clear
that
not
only
is
the
commission
statutorily
independent
from
the
control
of
the
president,
but
the
commission
is
even
free
from
its
so-called
partisan
influence,
the
president's
partisan
influence.
in
the
next
breath,
they
quite
frankly
admit
that
the
congressional
agents
are
on
the
commission
for
the
purpose
of
representing
the
congress,
and
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
commission
through
their
sound
advice,
so
not
only
has
the
congress
stripped
the
president
of
a
purely
article
ii
function,
enforcement
of
law,
and
placed
it
in
a
commission,
if
the
commission
is
right,
that
is
free
from
the
president's
control,
but
it
has
also
installed
on
that
agency
two
agents
of
its
own
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
commission
in
its
article
ii
functions.
this
is
more
unconstitutional,
your
honor,
than
if
congress
had
simply
said,
we'll
place
an
ex
officio
tenth
justice
on
this
court.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes,
your
honor,
they
are,
as
a
result
of
buckley,
so--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
the
president
has
got
influence
to
the
extent
that
the
appoints
the
members.
he
has
no
influence
beyond
that,
according
to
the
commission,
and
i
think
according
to
a
fair
reading
of
everything
we
know
about
congress'
intentions
for
this
commission.
he
has
no...
our
position
is
he
has
no
removal
authority
at
all,
let
alone
the
at-will
removal
authority
that
it
is
our
submission
the
president
must
have
if
this
commission
is
to
exercise
the
purely
executive
function
of
law
enforcement.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
and
it
is
our
submission
that
if
congress
is
going
to
place
authority
in
the
ftc
or
the
fec
to,
as
the
exclusive
civil
enforcement
authority
over
an
entire
regulatory
statute,
then
it
must
ensure
that
that
authority
is
subject
to
the
at-will
removal
control
of
the
president.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
your
honor,
the
ftc
at
the
time
the
court
made
that
ruling,
according
to
the
court,
did
not
participate
at
all
in
the
executive
authority.
its
powers
were
judicial.
its
powers
were
legislative.
it
did
not
at
that
time
have
civil
enforcement
authority
such
as
the
commission
here
has,
and
in
fact
the
commission's
authority--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--i
think
it's
doubly
unconstitutional
for
that
reason,
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
making
three
separation
of
powers
arguments:
the
presence
of
the
ex
officios
as
participating
members
on
the
commission,
with
full
rights
to
advise
and
in
fact
to
influence
through
their
sound
advice
the
commission,
is
an
unconstitutional
invasion
of
the
executive's
powers
because
the
commission
itself
exercises
exclusively
article
ii
powers.
secondly,
we
believe
that
in
fact
the
removal,
the
lack
of
removal
power
is
a
constitutional
dimension
problem,
and
not
humphrey's
executor,
not
morrison
v.
olson,
none
of
this
court's
cases
dealing
with
the
headless
fourth
branch,
justice
scalia,
have
ever
foreclosed
the
proposition
we
advance
here,
which
is
that
when
you
have
principal
officers
who
control
a
commission
charged
with
purely
article
ii
powers,
the
civil
enforcement
of
a
federal
regulatory
statute,
including
the
ability
to
get
penalties
as
the
commission
did
in
this
very
case,
and
you
cannot
divorce
the
president
from
the
control
of
that
activity,
and
none
of
this
court's
cases
have
held
otherwise.
finally,
we
think
that
the...
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
a
tougher
case
for
me
to
win,
largely
for
the
point
you
mentioned
earlier,
the
aggrandizement--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--of
congress,
but
i
don't...
i
think
that
if...
if
mr.
bender
is
correct,
and
i
think
he
probably
is,
that
the
exercise
of
this
authority,
this
participatory
authority
as
a
member
of
the
commission,
is
an
authority
that
only
an
officer
of
the
united
states
can
hold,
then--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--it
would.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
oh,
well,
under
those
circumstances
i
think
the
objectionable
features
would
be
drawn
out
very
thin.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily...
i
don't
think
i
would
lose
your
first
hypothetical,
necessarily.
i
think
my
case
would
be
weaker.
i
think
the
fact
that
congress
has
installed
two
plainly
congressional
agents
makes
my
case
very
strong,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
president
gets
to
appoint
six
members
from
the
public,
so
long
as
they
are
three
democrats
and
three
republicans,
a
feature
which
we
also
think
is
an
invasion
of
his
nomination
authority.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
fall
afoul
of
the
very
points
we're
making
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
cia
is
engaged
in
an
executive
function,
probably
a
purely
executive
function.
the
congress
has
at
its
disposal
a
range
of
constitutional
means
to
keep
itself
informed.
it
can
subpoena
the
cia,
and
except
for
executive
privilege
matters
it
can
learn
whatever
it
needs
to
learn
about
what
is
going
on
at
the
cia.
what
it
can't
do
is
invade
the
cia
with
an
agent
there
for
the
purpose
of
influencing--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
your
honor,
they
do
everything--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
they
do
everything
that
the
other
members,
the
other
six
members
do,
except
vote,
and
in
fact--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
no,
they
just
don't
get
paid--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
i'm
not--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--what
they
are
in
this
capacity--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
do
that.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
the
sentencing
commission...
it
may
well
be
a
problem,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
it
isn't
a
problem,
but
i
think
the
case
against
the
attorney
general's
ex
officio
membership
on
the
sentencing
commission
is
probably
weaker,
because
the
activities
that
the
sentencing
commission
performs
are
themselves
not
activities
that
the
executive
branch
can't
perform.
they
are
executive,
quasi
judicial,
quasi
legislative,
the
kind
of
activities
that
the
justice
department
performs,
so
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
is
a
part
of
that
ex
officio
is
not
necessarily
the
investing
in
the
attorney
general
powers
that
the
constitution
doesn't
allow
him
to
have.
these
ex
officio
congressional
agents
have
powers
of
an
executive
nature,
the
enforcement
of
a
regulatory
statute,
the
participation
in
the
decision-making
for
that
enforcement.
that
is
a
power
they
cannot
have.
now,
if
mr.
bender
is
right,
however,
and
that
is
also
a
power
that
requires
an
officer
appointed
under
the
appointments
clause,
then
the
attorney
general
is
clearly
unconstitutional
as
far
as
the
sentencing
commission
is
concerned.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
as
opposed
to
the
actions
that
took
place
from
the
filing
of
the
complaint
in
our--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
case
against
the
presence
of
the
ex
officios
with
respect
to
investigation
is
weaker
in
the
sense
that
this
court
in
buckley
recognized
that
congress
itself
can
perform
investigatory
powers,
and
that
the
federal
election
commission,
even
with
members,
voting
members
appointed
by
the
speaker
of
the
house,
for
example,
can
have
those
powers.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
by
attorneys
for
the
commission.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
oh,
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
however
murky
it
may
be
regarding
the
ex
officio,
the
participation
of
the
ex
officios
in
investigatory
activities,
it's
not
murky
at
all
that
a
complaint
filed
for
the
purpose...
by
a
government
agency
for
the
purpose
of
effecting
a
civil
penalty
for
a
violation
of
the
federal
regulatory
statute
is
an
executive
action,
and
so
that
is
what
this
commission
was
disqualified
by
the
constitution
from
doing,
because--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--they
are,
your
honor,
but
this
court's
decisions
have
always
recognized
that
the...
that
in
raising
a
defense
to
a
regulatory
action
of
this
kind
the
defendant
doesn't
have
to
show
that
a
different
decision
would
have
been
made.
that's
an
impossible
burden
on
a
defendant
raising
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
structure,
to
the
composition
of
the
enforcement
authority,
and
that
would
be
an
impossible
burden
to
place
on
the
respondent.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
buckley,
for
example,
i
think
morrison
v.
olson.
if...
and
this
really
gets
into
this
retroactivity
point.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
it
wouldn't
because,
at
least
it
is
our
submission
that
the
commission
was
constituted
such
that
it
was
disqualified
from
enforcing
this
statute.
it
was
disqualified
from
bringing
this--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
the
severance
provision
allows
for
the
correction
of
this
statute
and
it
to
go
forward
without
further
involvement
of
the
congress,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
those
acts
it
has
taken
which
were
invalid,
which
were
void,
can't
just
be
somehow
deemed
valid,
and
that--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--their
acts
were
not
invalid,
but
the
acts
of
the
commission
itself
were
invalid
because
of
the
presence--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--that's
what
the
severance
point
i
think
has
to
do
with
it,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
that's
true,
but
you
can't--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--you're
right,
your
honor,
and
my
point
on
the
operation,
justice
souter,
is
that
if
this,
if
these
ex
officios
had
had
voting
power,
but
only
two
out
of
eight,
they
couldn't
have
coerced
or
compelled
the
commission,
and
it
may
well
have
been
that
they
voted
against
this
action,
but
in
my
opinion,
that
would
clearly
make
it,
the
commission
itself,
void.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
my
argument
is
a
facial
challenge.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
my
argument
is
not
an
as-applied
argument,
it
is
a
facial
challenge
based
upon
the
membership
of
the
ex
officios,
not
upon
whether
or
not
they
actually
influenced
this
case
in
a
way
against
my
clients.
if
the
statute
had
said
all
of
the
federal
election
commission
members
will
be
white,
then
that
would
be
an
invalid
commission,
and
the
acts
taken
against
me,
even
if
they
would
have
been
taken
by
a
perfectly
constitutional
commission,
would
be
void,
in
my
opinion,
and
i
would
have
a
valid
defense.
if
in--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
your
honor,
if...
let's
take
the
morrison
case,
for
example.
if
this
court
had
thrown
out
the
independent
counsel
instead
of
upholding
it,
then
surely
it
would
follow,
i
would
submit,
that
the
criminal
prosecution
of
the
defendants
in
that
case
would
have
had
to
be
dismissed.
it
couldn't
have
just
been
continued
by
that
void
independent
counsel,
or
even
by
an
independent
counsel
at
that
point
somehow
constitutionally
repaired
to
go
forward.
the
same
would
be
true
in
the
buckley
case.
mr.
bender
suggested
that
buckley
held
that
we
can't
raise
a
separation
of
powers
defense
in
response
to
an
enforcement
action
against
us.
well,
buckley
wasn't...
did
not
arise
in
the
context
of
a
defense
for
an
enforcement
action.
it
was,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
a
declaratory
judgment
seeking
only
one
thing,
prospective
relief.
that's
what
they
got.
but
if
the
buckley
case
had
indeed
arisen
in
the
same
context
that
this
one
is,
with
mr.
buckley
and
others
suffering
under
not
only
what
we
submit
is
unconstitutional
prosecution
in
a
civil
enforcement
action,
but
the
actual
imposition
of
civil
penalties
against
them,
then
surely
this
court's
invalidation
of
the
commission
for
the
constitutional
violations
in
that
case
would
mean
that
those
civil
penalties
in
that
prosecution
under
the
federal
election
campaign
act
go
away.
and
that's
what
our
submission
is
here,
that
the
court
really,
if
we
are
correct
on
the
merits,
and
the
commission
itself
is
an
unconstitutionally
constituted
body
and
therefore
disqualified,
we
would
submit,
from
enforcing
a
federal
regulatory
statute
in
court,
then
the
court
can't
just,
i
think
in
the
words
of
the
harper
case,
disregard
current
law
and
allow
the
commission
to
just
go
forward
without
interruption
as
the
commission
would
suggest.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
it
can.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
don't
think
congress
has
any
greater
authority
to
validate,
or
somehow
deem
valid,
an
unconstitutional
