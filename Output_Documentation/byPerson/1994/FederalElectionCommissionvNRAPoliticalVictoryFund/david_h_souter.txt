justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
the
ftc
have
the
same,
a
similar
statute
to
yours?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
do
they
keep
transcripts
of
these
deliberations
that
are
later
made
public?
justice
david
h.
souter
verbatim
transcripts?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
it
interfere
with
us
any
more
than
the
ex
officios
are
interfering
with
the
fec?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
the
textual
difference,
it's
the
independent
textually
established
constitutional
status
of
this
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
on
that
reasoning
there
could
be
ex
officio
listeners
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
they
don't
have
any
textual
basis
in
the
constitution,
apart
from
the
provision
for
creation
of
all
the
federal
courts.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
what
sense
would
it
interfere,
any
more
than
this
interferes
with
the
fec?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
seems
to
me
you
are
arguing
just
the
other
way.
we
can
tell
them
to
go
to
the
devil,
but
the
people
on
the
fec
do
not
have
lifetime
tenure.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
keep
telling
me
about
textual
bases
or
nontextual
bases.
you
use
the
word
interfere,
which
i
think
has
a
factual
connotation.
what
is
the
interference
in
our
case
that
does
not
exist,
or
would
exist
in
our
case
that
does
not
exist
in
the
fec?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
a
statute
creating
the
listener
simply
subjects
the
listener
to
exactly
the
same
confidentiality
requirements
that
the
court
imposes
upon
itself,
so
there's
no...
we
assume
people
will
follow
the
law
in
good
faith.
there's
no
practical
risk
of
our
reading
of
the
deliberations
in
the
paper
next
week.
why
wouldn't
that
satisfy
your
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think...
i
agree
with
you,
but
i
don't
see
how
you're
drawing
the
line
between
the
two
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
any
rule
of
the
commission
or
any
rule
generally
that
would
prohibit
one
of
these
members
from
speaking
to
one
of
the
voting
members
on
the
way
down
the
hall
before
the
meeting
starts?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
wouldn't
be
anything
that
would
prevent
such
a
member
from
saying,
you
know,
37
senators
are
going
to
be
furious
if
you
go
after
so-and-so,
on
the
way
into
the
meeting?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
it's
also
a
function
that
the
general
public
doesn't
get
to
perform,
either.
they
don't
walk
down
the
hall
from
their
offices
to
the
meeting
rooms
with
the
commissioners,
so
that
there
are
opportunities,
even
within
the
technical
rules
there
are
opportunities
to
influence
which
members
of
the
general
public
wouldn't
have.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
another
question
before
you
get
to
retroactivity?
why
isn't
the
proper
way
to
characterize
the
case
something
like
this.
there's
an
automatic
severance
provision
in
effect
in
the
statute
for
this
agency.
therefore,
the
clear
unconstitutionality
is
the
activity,
the
presence
of
the
ex
officio
members.
the
way
to
cure
that
unconstitutionality
is,
in
fact,
to
declare
it
and,
if
there
were
need,
to
enjoin
any
further
participation
by
them.
the
only
remaining
question
is
whether
those
who
were
properly
constituted,
the
six
voting
members,
were
influenced
either
in
the
instigation
of
the
prosecution
or
its
continuance
by
the
two
who
had
a
potential
for
improper
influence.
therefore,
the
question
is,
find
out
whether
in
fact
that
happened
and,
if
it
didn't
happen,
or
perhaps
in
the
alternative
if
the
six
now
wish
to
proceed,
period,
that
is
enough
remedy
for
you.
the
constitutionality
is
cured,
the
remedy
is
prospective,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
you'd
have
a
stronger
argument
if
you
didn't
have
a
severance
provision,
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
a
way
of
characterizing
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
clear
from
the
severance
provision
that
the
acts
of
the
six
are
not,
per
se,
facially
unconstitutional
merely
from
the...
because
of
the
presence
of
the
two.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
one
distinction
from
a...
a
non...
a
statutory
severance
case
from
a
nonstatutory
severance
case,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
would
make
it,
because
your
argument
would
still
be
an
influence
argument,
just
as
it
is
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can't
compel
with...
two
out
of
six
does
not
compel,
nonvoting
two
out
of
six
does
not
compel,
but
your
argument
would
be
essentially
the
same,
wouldn't
it?
