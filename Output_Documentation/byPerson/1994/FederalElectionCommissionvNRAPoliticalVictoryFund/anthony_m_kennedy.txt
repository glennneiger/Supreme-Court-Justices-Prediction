anthony
m.

you
don't
think
the
word
suits
in
that
statute
helps
the
attorney,
the
s.g.?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
saying
that
appeals
in
518
indicates
that
it
comprehends
writs
of
certiorari.
i
thought
that
was
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
518
it
says,
suits
and
appeals.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
correct
to
say
they're
part
of
the
decisional
process?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
thought
it
was
clear
here,
according
to
your
brief,
that
the
agency
does
not
have
that
authority.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
is
there
an
agency
theory
that
if
you
reasonably
think
you
have
authority
you're
more
likely
to
have
it
than
if
you
don't,
is
that
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
you
saying
that
this
is
not
a
proper
defense
to
an
enforcement
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
there's
a
constitutionally
defective
structure,
constitutionally
defective
entity
that
brings
an
enforcement
action
against
you,
that
constitutional
defect
is
not
a
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
retroactivity
point,
would
we
have
held
that
if
there
are
certain
deficiencies
in
the
grand
jury's
structure,
if
the
case
proceeds
and
there's
a
conviction,
the
grand
jury
deficiency
is
essentially
harmless
error
in
some
contexts.
why
isn't
that
true
here?
wasn't
there
an
enforcement
proceeding
that
went
ahead
in
the
district
court?
there
was
an
adjudication
of
liability?
why
doesn't
that
cure
any
defect
that
occurred
in
the
investigative
stage
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
the
case
prosecuted
in
the
district
court
by
attorneys
for
the
commission,
or
by
the
justice
department?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
you
say
that...
would
you
say
that
there's
an
ongoing
violation
of
the
structural
nature
because
those
attorneys
are
under
the
supervision
of
the
commission
which
has
these
ex
officio
members
on
it?
is
that
your
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
prevail
on
the
merits,
can
congress
act
quickly
and
ratify
all
existing
enforcement
actions?
