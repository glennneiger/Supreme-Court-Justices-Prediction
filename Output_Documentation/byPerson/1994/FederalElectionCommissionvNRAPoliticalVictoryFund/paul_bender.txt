mr.
paul
bender
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
commission's
independent
litigating
authority,
we
take
the
position,
as
you
know
from
the
brief
we
filed
in
response
to
the
court's
invitation,
that
the
commission
does
not
have
independent
litigating
authority.
the
right
procedure,
i
think,
would
be
for
the
clerk
to
reject
the
brief
or
petition
filed
by
an
agency
without
such
authority,
and
ask
the
solicitor
general
whether
the
solicitor
general
in
fact
authorizes
the
petition.
in
this
case,
we
did,
in
response
to
the
court's
question,
authorize
the
petition.
i
think
that
authorization
is
valid.
mr.
paul
bender
yeah,
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
paul
bender
--right,
and
i
think
it's
also
understandable
that
the
fec
did
not
ask
us
for
authority
before
filing
its
petition.
they
notified
us,
i
believe,
the
day
before
they
filed
it
as
a
matter
of
courtesy.
mr.
paul
bender
it...
no,
i
don't
think
so.
it's
similar
to
the
practice
that's
followed
throughout
the
appellate
courts
of
the
united
states
with
regard
to
notices
of
appeal.
agencies
of
the
united
states
often
file
protective
notices
of
appeal
without
first
getting
the
solicitor
general's
authorization
because
time
does
not
permit
that,
and
after
the
notice
of
appeal
is
filed,
the
solicitor
general
often
authorizes
the
appeal
and
it
goes
ahead.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
it
is.
the
solicitor
general
has
the
same
authority
to
authorize
appeals
by
the
united
states
as
it
does
to
authorize
participation
in
this
court.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
the
appeal
would
not
be
any
good,
unless
the
solicitor
general
approved,
authorized
the
going
forward
with
the
appeal,
but
i
think
the
approval
does
not
have
to
be
given
before
the
time
for
the
notice
of
appeal
to
be
filed,
because
of
the
time
pressure.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
no.
i'm
saying
that
they
are
valid,
even
though
the
authorization
comes
after
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
it's
an
acquiescence
practice.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
no.
mr.
paul
bender
in
light...
i
agree
it's
not
an
entirely
parallel
situation,
but
in
light
of
what
justice
o'connor
mentioned,
that
is
the
general
understanding
that
they
were
reasonable
in
having
that
they
could
file
this
petition
without
our
authorization,
the
petition
should
not
be
deemed
to
be
out
of
time
because
they
did
that
and
we
only
authorize
it
after--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
petition
is
filed.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
it's...
i
wouldn't
analyze
it
as
a
technical
question
of
the
law
of
agency.
i
would
analyze
it
as
a
question
of
whether
the
jurisdictional
limits
on
the
filing
of
the
petition
were
met
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that
since
an
agency
of
the
united
states
did
file
a
petition
and
signify
their
intention
to
go
forward
with
the
case,
and
since
we
relatively
promptly
authorized
that
petition
after
the
court
noticed
the
problem,
it
should
be
deemed
to
relate
back,
and
you
shouldn't
apply
technical
concepts
of
the
law
of
agency
to
the
question.
there's
no
unfairness
here
to
the
respondents.
they
had
notice
that
the
petition
was
being
filed
at
the
time.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
in
a
case
where
it
was
clear
that
the
agency
did
not
have
the
authority,
a
case
might
be
made
that
the
petition
should
be
deemed
out
of
time,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
take
into
account
here
the
reality
that
this
court
had
in
the
past--
mr.
paul
bender
--accepted
those
petitions.
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
bender
it
was...
it
is
clear
to
us
that
they
do
not,
but
the
agency
might
very
reasonably
have
thought
that
they
did,
because
in
the
past
they
have
filed
petitions
without
authorizations
from
the
solicitor
general
and
the
court
has
gone
ahead
and
granted
the
petitions
and
heard
the
cases
on
the
merits.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
you
should
analyze
this
as
a
matter
of
agency
theory.
i
think
you
should
analyze
it
as
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
court's
jurisdictional
limits
on
the
time
of
filing
a
petition,
and
i
think
if
it
is
unclear
whether
the
agency
has
the
authority,
and
the
agency
reasonably
believes
it
has
the
authority,
and
the
solicitor
general's
authorization
is
given
relatively
promptly
afterwards,
that
there's
nothing
that
prevents
you
from
having
that
authorization
relate
back.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
all
members
of
the
commission
would
have
to
be
appointed
by
the
president.
i
think
they
are
officers.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
i
think--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
appointments
clause
is
a
simple
way
to
decide
this
case
on
the
merits,
and
for
the
reason
the
court
has
given
in
its
questions,
we
think
that
the
fact
that
they
don't
have
the
vote
is
not
determinative.
they
can
participate
in
discussions,
they
can
put
items
on
the
agenda,
they
can
make
motions
as
far
as
we
know,
they
can
supervise
the
staff,
they
can
participate
in
private
discussions
between
petitioners,
they
are
colleagues
of
the
other
commissioners.
i
would
like
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
time
on
the
question
of
remedy,
which
the
fec
did
not
have
a
chance
to
explore
at
length
in
its
argument.
our
view
is
similar
to
theirs.
we
agree
with
the
fec
with
regard
to
the
remedy,
that
the
court
should
follow
the
same
practice
it
followed
in
buckley
and
valeo.
in
buckley
and
valeo
the
court
went
out
of
its
way,
even
though
it
held
that
the
structure
of
the
commission
was
unconstitutional,
to
delay
its
mandate
for
30
days
in
order
not
to
interrupt
enforcement
of
the
provisions,
the
substantive
provisions
that
the
court
sustains.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
and
this
challenge
should
also
have
been
a
declaratory
judgment,
and
if
it
had
been
a
declaratory
judgment,
then
i
think
buckley
would
be
directly
on
point,
and
you
would
follow
that
procedure.
i
don't
think
you
ought
to
change--
mr.
paul
bender
--right,
but
the
structural
defect
that
the
respondent
points
to
was
never
alleged
by
the
respondent
to
be
prejudicial
at
all
to
the
respondent,
and
in
fact
the
respondent
did
not
make
the
claim,
as
it
could
have
before
the
federal
election
commission
when
they
were
considering
the
bringing
of
the
enforcement
action
against
them.
and
so
a
structural
challenge
like
this,
especially
in
light
of
buckley,
which
says
that
enforcement
can
go
forward
even
though
the
structure
is
unconstitutional,
i
think
buckley
holds
that
that
kind
of
challenge
should
be
made
not
in
an
enforcement
proceeding
but
in
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
but...
although
buckley
holds
that
if
made
in
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding,
it
operates
only
prospectively.
buckley
further
holds
that
pending
enforcement
proceedings,
indeed,
enforcement
proceedings
that
weren't
even
pending
at
the
time
but
that
might
be
initiated
within
30
days
after
the
decision
in
buckley,
should
not
be
interfered
with.
that's
a
holding
of
buckley,
also,
and
i
think
if
you
read
that
in
connection
with
this
case,
the
conclusion
is
inevitable
that
you
cannot
raise
this
as
a
defense
in
the
pending
enforcement
proceeding.
now,
one
technical
difficulty
with
that,
i
should
point
out,
is
that
there
is
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
in
the
fec
statute,
section
437h,
and
it
is...
the
procedures
are
very
similar
to
the
procedures
that
happened
in
this
case,
but
there
is
a
technical
difference.
under
the
declaratory
judgment
procedure
in
the
statute,
the
district
court
is
not
to
decide
the
constitutional
question.
it
is
to
refer
it
immediately
to
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc.
that
didn't
happen
here.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
a
difference
in
the...
it's
a
difference
in
the
procedures
that
take
place.
i
don't
think
it
affects
the
ability
of
this
court
to
consider
the
issues.
in
this
case,
it's
true
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
consider
the
question
en
banc,
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
consider
the
questions
extensively.
the
questions
are
being
argued
to
you
here.
i
think
that
it
would
have
been--
mr.
paul
bender
--yes,
right.
i
think
buckley
holds
that,
that
this
is
not
a
proper
defense
in
an
enforcement
action,
because
buckley
holds
that--
mr.
paul
bender
--right.
i
think
that's
the
holding
of
buckley,
and
also
the
holding
of
northern
pipeline
with
regard
to
similar-type
structural
defects
in
the
bankruptcy
courts.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
that's
what
buckley
holds,
and
i
don't
think
it's
that
weird,
because...
i
think
that
should
not
apply
in
a
case
where
there
is
demonstrated
prejudice
from
the
structural
defect,
but
i
think
the
basis
for
buckley's
holding
that,
and
i
think
it
is
sensible,
is
that
when
there
isn't
any
prejudice
from
it,
it
makes
sense
not
to
disrupt,
cancel,
invalidate
hundreds
of
pending
proceedings,
throwing
the
whole
scheme
of
the
federal
statute
into
disruption.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
you
can
make
it
if
you
can
show
prejudice.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
