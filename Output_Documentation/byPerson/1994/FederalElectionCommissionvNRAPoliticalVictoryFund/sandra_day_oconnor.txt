are
you
also
going
to
address
whether
you
have
authority
to
represent
the
fec
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
you
could
read
28
u.s.
code
518(a),
giving
the
solicitor
general
authority,
as
not
being
inconsistent
with
the
statute
437d
that
you
rely
on.
in
other
words,
the
commission
can
appeal
every
place
except
here,
and
when
coming
here,
it
has
to
be
the
solicitor
general.
i
suppose
you
could
give
effect
to
both
those
statutes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
statute
in
title
26
expressly
gives
the
fec
authority.
i
suppose
that
all
these
statutes
could
be
read
so
as
to
say
the
fec
does
not
have
authority
to
petition
this
court
in
this
case
today.
if
we
were
to
say
that,
do
you
think
that
the
subsequent
permission
given
by
the
solicitor
general
could
possibly
cure
the
jurisdictional
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
the
consent
wasn't
given
until
long
after
the
petition
was
filed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
the
clerk
should
just
refuse
to
accept
the
filing
in
the
first
instance,
if
it
comes
in
here
without
the
solicitor
general's
participation,
and
that
ends
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
you're
right,
your
opponent
suggests
that
congress
could
put
ex
officio
members
on
this
court
to
sit
in
our
conference,
and
under
your
theory,
that's
okay,
because
all
they
can
do
is
discuss
it
with
us.
that's
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
violation
of
separation
of
powers
if
congress
were
to
send
some
ex
officio
members
to
this
court's
conference?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
we
have
accepted
petitions
from
the
fec
in
the
past
that
weren't
authorized.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
seems
to
be
kind
of
a
practice
of
it,
so
it's
quite
understandable
that
the
clerk
accepted
this
one,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
would
the
subsequent
consent
or
authorization
relate
back?
i
mean,
if
the
thing
isn't
properly
filed,
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
matter?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
bender,
you
agree...
you
disagree
with
fec
on
the
merits
and
say
that
this
is
a
violation
of
separation
of
powers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
these
members
have
to
be
appointed
by
the
president?
are
they
officers
of
the
united
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
think
they're
covered
by
the
appointments
clause--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cooper,
before
you
go
into
retroactivity,
just
explain
to
me,
if
you
would,
how
it
is
that
the
attorney
general
can
be
a
member
of
the
sentencing
commission,
and
that's
not
a
problem.
