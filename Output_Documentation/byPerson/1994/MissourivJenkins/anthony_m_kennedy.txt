m.

well,
isn't
one
of
the
original
evils
of
a
segregated
system
substandard
academic
performance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
the
district
court
made
any
determinations
or
given
any
guidance
as
to
when
it
is
feasible
or
practical...
practicable
to
end
its
supervision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
must
think
about
that
under
freeman
and
pitts,
must
it
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
the
principal
objective
of
the
court
must
be
to
return
control
of
this
district
to
the
civic
authorities,
not
the
judicial
authorities?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what's
happening
here
is
that
the
greater
the
intrusion
into
the
local
domain,
the
easier
it
is
for
the
court
to
justify
its
continued
supervision,
and
i
should
think
the
calculus
ought
to
be
just
the
other
way
around.
i
mean,
you're
asking
here...
we
haven't
discussed
it
yet...
that
we
affirm
the
order
raising
teacher
salaries,
and
i
just
see
no
end
to
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
fear,
based
on
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
that
the
only
way
for
you
to
continue
this
funding
is
to
continue
the
judicial
supervision--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--which
is
contrary
to
freeman
and
pitts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
there
in
this
record
that
shows
the
inability
of
the
school
district
to
make
its
own
determinations
as
to
how
to
allocate
its
existing
revenues
for
salaries?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
does
it
need
supervision
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
are
funds
limited
as
a
result
of
the
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
they've
all
been
spent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
fascinating
sociological
inquiry,
but
i
submit
that
it
is
highly
questionable
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
a
practicable
measure
for
the
court
to
use
to
determine
how
quickly
it
can
return
the
control
of
this
district
to
the
elected
and
democratically
responsible
authorities.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
jurisdiction
does
not
remain
until
the
results
of
segregation
are
gone.
it
remains
until
all
practicable
remedies
to
accomplish
that
have
been
gone,
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
you
have
not
addressed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
you
say
it
must
present--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
say
it
must
present
this
evidence
in
order
to
resist
an
order
requiring
it
to
increase
teacher
salaries?
that's
exactly
where
we
are.
