mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondents
contend
that
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state,
without
even
attempting
to
meet
its
burden
of
proof
under
this
court's
decision
in
freeman
v.
pitts,
is
entitled
to
an
order
of
partial
unitary
status
ending
the
milliken
ii
remedial
components
of
the
remedy
ordered
by
the
district
court.
under
freeman,
of
course,
the
state
had
the
burden
of
showing
1)
that
the
vestiges
of
segregation
have
been
eliminated
to
the
extent
practicable,
secondly
that
retention
of
judicial
control
was
not
necessary
to
achieve
the
compliance
with
the
decree
in
other
aspects
of
the
system,
or
the
facets
of
the
system,
and
thirdly,
that
there
has
been
full
and
complete
compliance
with
the
remedial
decree
in
good
faith.
the
state
has
not
even
attempted
to
meet
its
burden
of
proof.
at
the
hearing
below--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that
they
do.
i
think
that
brown
v.
board
of
education--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--they
may
be
included
in
the
vestiges,
but
i
realize--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--no,
i...
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
if
there's
a
district
court
finding
that
there's
a
violation
with
effects,
that
those
effects
can
be
remedied,
then
i
think
there's
a
duty
to
remedy
them.
the
state,
of
course,
is
always
free
to
come
in
and
show
that
it
is
impossible
to
remedy
those
effects
of
the
violation.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
my
argument
and
my
position
is
simply
that
swann
controls.
that
is
to
say
that
the
scope
of
the
remedy
is
determined
by
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
violation,
if
there
are
findings,
that
they
have
to
be
remedied,
but
that's
beyond
what's
presented
in
this
court.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
in
any
event,
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that's
beyond
what's
presented
before
this
court.
it's
not
necessary
to
reach
that
question,
because
that's
not
what
the
district
court
relied
upon.
it's
not
what
the
plaintiffs
rely
upon.
it's
not
what
the
school
district
relies
upon
in
their
arguments
that
the
remedy
needs
to
be
full
and
complete
in
its
effectiveness.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
the
findings
here...
no.
the
findings
here
are
much
more
specific.
the
findings
here
go
to
the
effects
of
segregation
with
respect
to
the
school
district's
ability
to
provide
quality
education
and
also
the
segregation
that
remained
in
the
system.
there
are
findings,
in
fact,
that
talk
about
other
effects
of
segregation,
but
we
believe
that
those
findings
are
not
as
crucial
to
the
remedy
here.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
the
school
board
certainly
still
has
the
management
responsibilities
over
the
district.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
because
the
state
has
been
found
guilty
of
the
constitutional
violation
which
precipitated
the
conditions
in
the
kansas
city
school
district,
its
responsibility
is
to
see
that
that...
that
the
effects
of
that
violation
are
remedied
to
the
extent
practicable.
now,
in
answering
that
question,
it
may
be
that
because
the
state
is
not
as
close
to
the
day-to-day
operations
of
the
school
district,
that
in
the
facts
of
determining
what
is
practicable,
there
may
be
a
difference.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
but
that's
a
factual
matter.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
no
question
with
respect
to
what
is
practicable
and
what
the
state
can
accomplish
has
been
foreclosed
by
the
district
court.
indeed,
the
problem
is
that
the--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--well,
perhaps
it's
time
for
me
to
speak
to
that
point,
then.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
it
is
not
the
position
of
the
plaintiffs
or
the
kansas
city,
missouri
school
district
and
the
district
court
that
this
is
an
outcome-based
measure.
that
is
to
say,
unitary
status
does
not
depend
on
any
particular
degree
of
test
scores.
the
district
court
simply
did
not
apply
that
standard.
the
argument
that
we
are
making,
which
is
consistent
with
this
court's
precedent
in
swann
and
milliken
ii
and,
indeed,
in
all
its
school
desegregation
jurisprudence,
is
that
a
district
court
has
to
have
flexibility
in
fashioning
a
desegregation
remedy,
and
in
the
process
of
doing
so,
it
certainly
can
continue...
can
consider
test
scores
as
one
among
many
factors
as
to
whether
or
not
the
violation
has
been
remedied,
but
it
can't
do
it
inflexibly.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
i
agree
that...
that's
right.
that
is
our
position
here,
that
we
have...
we're
not
arguing
here
that
any
particular
level
of
achievement
is
the
sole
determining
factor,
absolutely.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
justice
scalia,
the
district
court
made
a
finding
that
there
has
been
a
system-wide
reduction
in
academic
achievement
in
consequence
of
the
constitutional
violation...
that
is,
the
segregation.
this
is
a
district
that
is
a
heavily
majority
black
district,
and
it
is
that
way
as
a
consequence
of
the
violation
that
the
state
initiated,
and
in
which
the
kansas
city,
missouri
school
district
was
complicit.
as
a
consequence
of
that
violation--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--let
me...
let
me
answer
that
question--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--let
me
answer
that
question
in
two
ways.
first,
justice
scalia,
the
district
court
did
not
find
an
interdistrict
violation
as
it
related
to
the
suburban
school
districts.
they
were
let
out
by
the
court's
june
5th,
1984
order.
it
did
not
find
that
they
were
complicit
in
the
violation,
or
that
there
was
any
effect
in
any
one
of
those
school
districts.
the
district
court,
however,
has
made
findings
that
as
a
consequence
of
segregation,
black
students
were
impacted
in
the
kansas
city
school
district,
and
that
the
kansas
city
school
district
swelled
in
black
enrollment.
as
a
consequence
of
that,
the
kansas
city
school
district
ultimately
was
rendered
unable
to
raise
the
revenue
necessary
to
fund
public
education
in
an
adequate
way.
as
a
consequence,
all
of
the
schools
began
to
deteriorate.
that
affected
all
of
the
students
in
the
system.
let
me
use
this
analogy.
if
there
is
a
school
that
is
a
majority
black
school
as
a
consequence
of
segregative
state
action,
and
it
is
created
as
a
majority
black
school,
and
there
are
still
some
white
students
in
it,
those
white
students
will
suffer
the
same
effects
of
the
violation
as
the
black
students
or
the
majority
in
that
school.
that
is
the
same
thing
that
happened
in
the
kansas
city,
missouri
school
district.
eventually,
the
segregation
violation
overtook
the
entire
district,
and
all
of
the
students
suffered.
that
was
why
the
district
court
order
was
aimed
at
remedying
the
system-wide
reduction
in
achievement.
secondly--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--let
me,
then,
address
the
second
part,
which
i
think
may...
i
hope
it
will
answer
that
question,
justice
scalia,
and
that's
that
the
interdistrict
violation
was
not
found
by
the
district
court,
but
however,
there
are
findings
that
white
students
left
the
system
and
went
to
public
schools.
some
left
for
the
suburbs...
went
to
private
schools,
rather.
certainly,
even
in
an
intradistrict
remedy,
it's
appropriate
for,
given
those
findings,
which
are
not
under
challenge
here
and
we
believe
cannot
be
challenged
at
this
point,
for
the
court
to
fashion
a
remedy
that
attempts
to
attract
those
students
back
into
the
district.
it's
voluntary.
it
doesn't
run
afoul
of
milliken
i.
it
doesn't
impinge
upon
the
autonomy
of
the
suburban
school
districts.
it
also
aims
at
attracting
students
back
into
the
system
who
are
in
private
schools
within
the
boundaries
of
the
kansas
city,
missouri
school
district.
that
doesn't
in
any
way
implicate
the
interdistrict
violation
concerns
that
milliken
i
addresses.
that's
why
we
lost
on
interdistrict
relief.
we
know
that.
but
we
also
know
that
the
district
court
carefully
fashioned
a
remedy
that
would
precisely
address
the
violation
that
it
found
and
its
effects.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
that
question,
justice
kennedy,
the
court
began
to
take
up
in
the
april
16,
1993
order,
which
the
eighth
circuit
relied
upon.
that...
in
that
order,
the
court
asked
for
plans
from...
or
some...
rather,
not...
yes,
some
plans
from
the
parties
to
talk
about
a
phaseout
procedure
over
an
alternative
scheme
of
years.
that
indicated
that
the
court
is
already
thinking
about
that,
and
i
want
to
stress
that
contrary--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--that's
right.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
that's
correct.
that...
i
would
only
add
that
the
principal
objective
also
is
to
remedy
the
violation
and
then
return
it
to
the
control
of
the
authorities.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
i
think
that
the
court
was
attempting
to
get
before
it
an
array
of
alternative
plans
under
which
it
could
consider
what
the
best
transition
was
going
to
be.
that's
why
it
chose
these
3-year,
7-year,
10-year
plans
as
the
panoply
at
which
it
wanted
to
look.
that
makes
sense.
it
wanted
to
carefully
consider
the
transition
phase.
it
also
stressed,
i
think,
contrary
to
what
i
believe
the
state's
representations
to
be,
that
it
was
contemplating
this
transition
to
a
system
in
which
the
kansas
city,
missouri
school
district
would
be
largely
responsible,
or
wholly
responsible,
for
funding
whatever
components
of
the
remedy
are
left
in
place,
and
it
would
have
to
consider
that
consistent
with
the
fact
that
the
state
would
no
longer
be
in
as
a
defendant
that
was
funding
the
remedy.
we
think
that's
proper
under
freeman,
under
dowell,
and
it's
a
responsible
way
for
the
district
court
to
proceed.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
exactly
the
kind
of
concern
that
i
think
the
district
court
contemplated
addressing
in
asking
for
these
plans.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
well,
i
think
in
part
the
answer
is
that
if
the
plan
as
it
is
working
now
continues
to
succeed
in
attracting
white
patients
back
into
the
district,
that
would
undercut
the
stigma
that
has
been
attached
to
the
school
district
in
which
whites
were
not
enrolled
and
as
a
consequence
they
wouldn't
fund
the
district,
and
it
may
be
possible
to
get
on
a
better
footing
with
respect
to
local
funding
for
the
school
system.
it
also
is
not
necessary
to
maintain
all
of
the
aspects
of
the
remedy
in
place,
once
a
district
is
unitary.
at
that
point,
there
should
be
a
transition
to
a
system
that
may
be
scaled
down
in
terms
of
the
way
in
which
it
operates.
many--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--oh,
well,
it--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--justice
kennedy--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--i
have
no
doubt
that
there
will
be
an
end
to
this
remedy,
and
certainly
this
court's
teachings
make
it
clear
to
all
of
the
parties
that
the
court
will
not
countenance
perpetual
jurisdiction.
that's
not
what
this
remedy
is
about.
there
are
difficult
questions
with
respect
to
how
to
make
the
transition
once
the
school
system
is
unitary,
but
that's
precisely
what
this
court
considered
in
freeman
and
why
it
requires
district
courts,
given
the
kind
of
deference
that
this
court
has
traditionally
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
district
courts,
to
answer
the
difficult
questions
about
how
to
make
that
transition.
i
don't
have
all
the
answers
at
this
point
as
to
how
this
would
work,
because
it
has
not
yet
been
before
the
district
court,
but
we
think
those
questions
should
be
brought
there
first,
and
not
here,
that
the
process
of
adjudication
should
not
be
an
inverted
pyramid
in
which
the
issues
balloon
as
the
case
goes
up
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
yes,
justice
o'connor,
although
it
is
certainly
a
question
of
discretion,
and
i
understand
the
concerns
of
the
court.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
no,
justice
o'connor,
but--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--it
does
have
something
to
do
with
the
day-to-day
operations
of
the
district,
and
the
day-to-day
operations
of
the
district
with
respect
to
its
ability
to
carry
out
the
desegregation
plan.
the
findings,
again,
of
the
district
court
are
that
as
a
consequence
of
segregation
this
is
a
district
that
was
woefully
underfunded.
it
was
devastated
as
a
consequence
of
the
violation.
now,
the
ability
of
the
school
district
to
raise
funds
as
a
consequence
of
this
court's
order
with
respect
to
the
tax
decision
that
was
before
it
is
one
that
limits
those
funds
to
actually
desegregation
purposes,
ultimately.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
justice
kennedy--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--as
you
phrase
the
question,
i
believe,
that
is
to
say,
as
i
understand
your
question,
it's
what
is
that
says
that
the
court
must
be
involved
in
the
school
district's
decisions
as
to
how
to
allocate
salary--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--a
budget
for
salary?
there
is
no
rule
of
law
that
per
se
requires
the
school
district
to
do
that.
however,
because
of
the
woefully
limited
funds
available
to
this
school
district
as
a
consequence
of
the
effects
of
the
violation
and
the
limitations
on
the
money
that
the
school
district
is
able
to
raise
with
respect
to
the
necessity
to
fund
its
share
of
the
desegregation
components
of
the
remedy,
it
just
doesn't
leave
much
money
available.
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
because--
mr.
theodore
m.
shaw
--because
the
state
has
insisted,
understandably,
that
the
school
district
fund
its
share
of
the
remedy,
and
it
has
not
always
been
able
to
do
that,
so
the
court
has
applied
principles
of
joint
and
several
liability,
but
the
fact
is
that
there's
just
been
limited
ability
of
the
school
district
at
this
point
to
fund
the
remedy.
