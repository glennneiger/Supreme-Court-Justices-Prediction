mr.
paul
bender
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
believes
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
correct,
and
that
it
should
be
affirmed.
we
agree,
justice
scalia,
that
there's
no
power
in
the
courts
to
require
this
district
to
achieve
educational
performance
that's
equal
to
or
greater
than
the
surrounding
suburban
districts,
or,
indeed,
equal
or
greater
than
any
other
district
in
the
country,
or
any
arbitrary
level
or
chosen
level
of
achievement,
but
there
is
a
power
and,
indeed,
a
responsibility,
to
require
the
district
to
remove
the
lingering
effects
of
the
unconstitutional
segregation
that
were
present
in
this
district
for
a
long
time.
there
are
students
who,
in
1982...
in
1992,
when
the
district
court
order
in
this
case
was
issued,
had
spent
several
years
in
a
segregated
situation
in
this
school
district.
those
years...
assume,
for
example,
that
there
were
the
first
4
or
5
years
of
the
student's
academic
career--
mr.
paul
bender
--they
could
be
in
tenth
grade.
the
remedies
in
this
case,
the
milliken
ii
remedies
in
this
case,
were
not
fully
implemented
until
the
late
1980's.
the
district
court
decided
that
they
should
be
implemented
in
1985.
they're
not
implemented
overnight.
so
you
could
have
a
student
in
tenth
grade
now
who
spent
the
first
4
or
5
years
of
her
years
in
school
in
a
segregated
system
that
the
district
court
has
found
suffered
tremendously
from
the
effects
of
segregation.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
that
they
do,
right.
it
was
probably
in
a
different
school.
but
if
a
child
in
the
first
4
or
5
years
of
school
did
not
learn
basic
reading
skills,
basic
reading
comprehension,
basic
communication
skills,
basic
concepts
of
number
values,
basic
study
skills,
you
cannot
expect
a
student
like
that
to
immediately
start
achieving
at
the
level
the
student
would
have
achieved
if
the
student
had
not
suffered
those
deprivations
instantly.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
i
believe
that
that's
true,
and
certainly
the
state
can
bring
before
the
district
court
an
effort,
a
claim
to
have
some
or
all
of
those
remedies
reduced
or
eliminated
in
some
of
the
lower
grades,
but
there's
a
procedure
that
this
court
has
set
out
in
which
the
state
should
do
that,
and
the
state
has
not
followed
that
procedure
in
this
case.
if
the
state
followed
that
procedure,
it
would
be
required
1)
to
show
that
it
has
implemented
in
good
faith
the
remedies
that
the
court
required.
secondly,
it
would
have
to
show
that
those
remedies
have
removed
the
vestiges
of
segregation
to
the
extent
practicable.
not
that
it
has
removed
them
altogether,
but
to
the
extent
practicable.
mr.
paul
bender
there
are
lots
of
different
ways
to
make
that
showing.
for
example,
the
district
court
found...
in
making
its
finding
that
the
segregation
had
had
the
result
of
impairing
academic
performance,
the
district
court
relied
on
a
number
of
factors.
some
were
test
scores,
comparing
test
scores
in
this
district
with
test
scores
in
other
districts
of
a
similar
nature
except
that
they
had
not
suffered
segregation.
other
things
that
would
indicate
that
there
was
low
academic
performance
would
be
graduation
rates,
attendance
rates,
dropout
rates,
things
like
that.
the...
i
would
think
that
the
first
thing
you
would
want
to
do
is
compare...
let's
take
this
hypothetical
tenth
grade
student
now,
or
tenth
grade
students
in
general
in
the
system,
and
see
whether
their
performance,
general
academic
performance,
is
comparable
with
students
in
systems
in
other
cities
of
similar
size
and
demographics
that
had
not
suffered
from
the
terrible
deprivations
that
segregation
caused
here.
that
would
be
one
step.
mr.
paul
bender
it
seems
to
me
that
it
could
be
quite
practical,
justice
kennedy.
for
example,
suppose
you
saw
that
the
students
in
the
tenth
grade
in
the
kansas
city
schools
had
roughly
the
same
academic
achievement
as
the
students
in
the
tenth
grade
in
the
philadelphia
public
schools,
or
the
new
york
public
schools.
that
would
be
a
very
powerful
indication
that
the
effects
of
the
segregation
were
no
longer
present,
because
the
students
in
philadelphia
had
not
suffered
that
de
jure
segregation.
mr.
paul
bender
you
mean
originally,
when
the
district
court--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
the
district
court
compared
originally
in
1985--
mr.
paul
bender
--national
norms
would
not
be...
right.
national
norms
are
not
the
right
test.
i
think
if
you're
going
to
do
that
kind
of
comparison,
which
is
one
way,
and
i
think
if
the
comparison
showed
that
they
were
comparable,
that
they
were
about
the
same,
you
could
easily
conclude
that
the
results
of
segregation
had
been
gone.
another
thing
you
can
look
at
is,
you
would
expect
that
if
the
educational
performance
was
lower
in
1985,
and
then--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
one
way
you
could
show
that,
for
example,
is
after
the
remedies
were
started
you
would
look
at
test
scores,
or
other
indicia
like
attendance
rates,
for
the
next
2
years,
and
see
what
happened
to
them.
you
might
find
that
they
went
up
and
then
leveled
off.
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
powerful
indication
that
you
had
done
as
much
as
was
practicable
to
do.
you
might
find
that
they
never
went
up
at
all,
which
again
i
think
would
show
that
you
had
done
as
much
as
was
practicable
to
do,
because
these
remedies
were
the
remedies
which
were
the
state-of-the-art
educational
remedies
at
the
time.
but
you
might
find
that
they
have
been
going
up
every
year,
and
that
that
progress
continues,
and
if
you
found
that,
and
in
addition
found
that
the
level
of
progress
was
below
the
level
in
philadelphia,
or
san
francisco,
or
new
york,
that
would
be
powerful
evidence
that
the
remedies
should
not
be
stopped,
because
the
effects
of
the
segregation
were
still
there.
mr.
paul
bender
absolutely.
mr.
paul
bender
a
lot
of
that
was
spent
on
capital
improvements
which
are
not
repetitive
expenses,
but
i
agree
with
you
completely
that
the
level
of
expenditure
necessary
is
relevant.
mr.
paul
bender
also
relevant.
mr.
paul
bender
all
of
those
things
are
relevant,
but
those
things
are
exactly
what
the
district
court
should
be
asked
to
consider,
and
those
are
the
issues
on
which
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proof
in
showing
that
it
has
done
whatever
it
is
practicable
to
do.
what
are
the
additional
costs
of
continuing
these
remedies
for
a
couple
of
years?
mr.
paul
bender
no.
the
amount
of
money
that
had
been
spent
up
until
then
was
before
the
district
court,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
state
presented
to
the
district
court
any
of
the
evidence
i'm
talking
about,
or
how
these
remedies
worked.
in
fact,
the
state
has
said
here
today
that
that's
a
totally
irrelevant
question.
if
the
state
maintained
that
position
below,
then
it
did
not
make
that
showing.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
where
the
thing
starts.
mr.
paul
bender
we...
the
government
has
not
taken
a
position
on
the
teacher
salary
issue,
which
does
not
have
national
importance.
as
far
as
we
know
this
is
the
only
district
in
which
that
issue
has
arisen.
but
to
the
extent
that
teacher
salaries
are
relevant,
and
i
think
to
some
extent
they
are,
to
the
quality
of
the
education
program,
and
to
the
extent
that
it's
necessary
to
keep
teacher
salaries
at
a
certain
minimum
level
to
ensure
that
you're
getting
decent
teachers
into
the
system,
yes,
the
state
would
have
to
show
that
if
you
lowered
the
teacher
salaries,
if
you
withdrew
the
support
for
teacher
salaries,
then
you
wouldn't
go
back
to
the
educational
deficiencies
that
you
had
before.
mr.
paul
bender
i
agree--
mr.
paul
bender
--but
i
think,
justice--
mr.
paul
bender
--o'connor,
it's
very
important
for
this
court
to
make
clear
that
you
have
to
follow
an
orderly
procedure
in
withdrawing
from
those
remedies,
that
you
don't
do
that
by
making
factual
assertions
in
an
appellate
court
or
in
the
supreme
court
that
you...
you
don't
do
that
by
making
assertions
that
you
don't
back
up
with
proof.
the
way
to
do
that
is
to
go
to
the
district
court
and
say,
look,
we
don't
think
that
we
should
have
to
be
having
all-day
kindergartens
any
more,
because
the
students
coming
into
the
school
now
have
not
been
harmed
by
the
prior
segregation.
mr.
paul
bender
thank
you.
