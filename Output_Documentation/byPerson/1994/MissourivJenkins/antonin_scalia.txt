justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it
is
not
a
relevant
factor,
and
that
if
all
other
factors
have
been
satisfied
but
this
one
hasn't,
and
therefore
that's
the
sole
basis
why
you're
denied
the
unitary
status,
that's
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
if
you
have
nondiscriminatory
input,
teachers
and
textbooks
and
so
forth,
for
a
certain
period
of
time,
for
long
enough,
that
every
student
who
is
currently
in
the
school
system
has
not
been
subjected
to
lower
input.
then
it
could
not
be
possible
that
any
of
the
lower
achievement
is
a
vestige
of
discrimination,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
for
how
long
has
that
compliance
with
the
equal
input
requirement
existed
in
this
school
system?
justice
antonin
scalia
'85,
'86?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
at
least
at
the
grammar
school
level,
through
eighth
grade,
there's
nobody
in
that
system
that
hasn't
had
equal
input?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
in
'85
the
district
court
was
not
trying
to
equalize
all
of
the
schools
in
the
district,
but
was
rather
trying
to
have
a
level
of
input,
and
of
accomplishment,
that
made
that
district
better
than
all
the
surrounding
districts.
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
that
the
purpose
for
the
additional
upgrading
that
you
agreed
to,
not
necessarily
assume
that
all
these
schools
within
the
district
were
equal,
but
rather,
to
make
this
district
better
than
the
ones
around
it
so
it
would
attract
new
students?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
we
have
to
instruct
the
lower
courts
to
that
effect?
isn't
it
enough
simply
to
answer
the
questions
that
you
presented
in
your
petition
and
to
say
that
no,
student
achievement
levels
cannot
be
the
basis
for
measuring
compliance
because...
because,
without
ordering
it
to
do
anything,
because
you
have
no
power
to
require
this
district
to
be
better
than
surrounding
districts?
can
we
not
just
give
it
as
a
reason
for
the
precise
matters
you
ask
us
to
address
in
issuing
any
order
on
that
subject?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
you
do
that,
it
seems
to
me
you're
going
beyond
the
questions
presented.
i
thought
your
position
was,
in
answering
the
question
presented,
of
course
you
can't
decide
whether
this
particular
matter
is
within
the
power
of
the
court
to
decree
unless
you
know
what
the
court
is
authorized
to
achieve,
and
if
it
is
not
authorized
to
achieve
interdistrict
comparability,
or,
indeed,
interdistrict
superiority,
then
this
particular
factor
is
improper.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
most
you'll
get
from
me.
[laughter]
let
me
ask
you
this:
in
missouri,
have
there
been
any
challenges
brought
by
districts
that
are
not
within
this
district
who
claim,
we're
being
denied
equal
protection
because
the
facilities
and
opportunities
afforded
us
by
the
state
are
so
much
less
than
afforded
in
this
district?
have
you
had
to
face
those
claims
yet?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
those
vestiges
include
what
justice
souter
was
asking
about,
or
the
fact
that
that
attitudes
in
one
generation
get
passed
on
to
another
generation?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that...
those
were
included
in
the
vestiges?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
the
state
has
to
prove
that
they
are
no
longer
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
only
defense?
the
state
is
obliged
to
prove
that
there
is
no
such
vestige,
or
that
if
there
is,
there
is
nothing
the
state
can
do
about
it,
even
for
something
as
remote,
as
unproximate
as
a
generational
attitude
that's
several
generations
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
hate
to
have
to
try
to
prove
that,
either
that
it
no
longer
existed,
or
that
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
done
about
it.
it
seems
to
me
quite
impossible.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shaw,
as
i
understand
the
law,
a
state
can
have
different
districts
that
have
a
different
level
of
educational
input,
and
districts
that
have
a
different
level
of
achievement,
so
long
as
there's
not
discrimination
within
each
of
those
districts
between
majority
and
minority
students.
why
is
it
relevant
to
that
issue
of
law
what
the
test
scores
of
the
district
as
a
whole
are?
as
i
understand
what
we're
talking
about
here,
it's
not
the
test
scores
of
minority
students
who
are
presumably
bearing
the
vestiges
of
prior
discrimination,
but
rather
the
test
scores
of
the
entire
district,
white
and
minority
as
well.
i
don't
see
any
relevance
of
that
to
the
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
would
be
an
interdistrict
violation,
and
i
thought
there
had
been
no
finding
of
an
interdistrict...
in
fact,
a
finding
that
there
was
no
interdistrict
violation.
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
there
is
discrimination
within
the
district
between
minority
and
majority
students,
and
i
don't
see
it's
at
all
relevant
to
that
what
the
average
test
score
of
the
district
as
a
whole
is.
it
would
be...
it
would
be
arguably
relevant
what
the
test
scores
of
the
minority
students
were,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--now,
i
do
see
how
it's
relevant
what
the
test
score
of
the
whole
district
is
if
you're
trying
to
attract
students
from
other
districts,
but
that's
an
interdistrict
problem
and
an
interdistrict
remedy.
i
don't
see
how
it
relates
to
intradistrict
matters.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that
explanation,
but
i
don't
see
why
it
isn't
an
explanation
that
rests
on
a
presumption
of
an
interdistrict
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
all
of
this
funding
just
directed
at
those
upper
grades
so
that
it
sort
of
follows
this
hypothetical
student
from
the
fifth
grade,
where
she
was
when
the
disparities
were
eliminated,
up
to
the
sixth
grade?
it's
my
impression
this
money
is
going
to
the
whole
system--
justice
antonin
scalia
--including
those
people
who
have
never
been
under
a
segregated--
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
comparison
that
was
made?
i
thought
it
was
against
average
national
standards.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
what
was
the
district
court
looking
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
below
national
norms,
is
what
the
district
court...
below
national
norms
at
many
grade
levels.
well,
i
mean,
half
the
country
is
below
national
norms.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
the
amount
of
money
spent
is
one
element
of
practicability?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
1.3
billion
here
already.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
about
the
length
of
time
that
you
withhold
this
school
district
from
democratic
control--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
it's
managed
by
a
federal
district
judge?
