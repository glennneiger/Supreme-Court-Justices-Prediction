h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
93-1823,
missouri
v.
jenkins.
mr.
munich.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
difference
between
per-student
spending
in
this
district
versus
per-student
spending
in
missouri
districts
as
a
whole?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
opposed
to
4,000
state-wide?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
munich.
mr.
shaw,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
don't
argue
here
that
the
lingering
consequences
of
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
people
who
were
in
segregated
schools
is
a
factor
in
this
particular
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you--
--as
a
practical
matter,
doesn't
that
sound
like
the
district
is
kind
of
walking
towards
a
cliff?
if
they're
now
getting
somewhere
between
9,000
and
13,000
per
student,
as
compared
to
4,000
in
other
missouri
districts,
and
all
of
a
sudden
that
funding
is
gone,
then
what
happens
to
the
school
district?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
sort
of
plan
would
solve
that
problem?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shaw.
mr.
bender.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
hypothetically
the
students
should
now
be,
what,
high
school
seniors?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
different
school.
i
mean,
i
take
it,
in
kansas
city
people
don't
go
to
the
same
school
from
kindergarten
through
high
school
senior.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bender.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
three
cases,
the
first
is
number
93-1823
missouri
versus
jenkins.
in
this
18-year-old
desegregation
litigation
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
state
of
missouri?s
challenge
to
orders
by
the
lower
courts
requiring
the
state
to
fund
salary
increases
for
instructional
and
non-instructional
staff
within
the
kansas
city
missouri
school
district
and
to
continue
to
fund
remedial
quality
education
programs
because
student
achievement
levels
were
still
at
or
below
national
norms.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
lower
court?s
decisions.
in
a
long
line
of
cases,
we?d
held
the
nature
and
scope
of
a
desegregation
remedy
has
to
be
determined
by
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
constitutional
violation.
the
constitutional
violation
identified
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
consisted
of
segregation
and
a
reduction
in
the
level
of
student
achievement
within
the
kansas
city
missouri
school
district.
here
however,
the
district
court
ordered
salary
increases
in
part
to
attract
non-minority
students
from
outside
the
school
district,
because
the
scope
of
the
constitutional
violation
was
limited
to
the
bounds
of
the
kansas
city
school
district.
the
district
court?s
order
of
salary
increases,
which
had
the
goal
of
attracting
non-minority
students
from
outside
the
school
district,
exceeded
the
scope
of
its
remedial
authority.
similarly,
we
overturn
the
order
requiring
the
state
to
continue
to
fund
the
quality
education
program.
in
our
case
of
freeman
against
pitts
decided
several
years
ago,
we
set
out
factors
that
a
district
court
must
consider
when
deciding
whether
to
order
complete
or
partial
relief
from
a
desegregation
decree.
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
inquiry
is
to
determine
whether
the
constitutional
violator
has
demonstrated
a
good
faith,
commitment
to
full
compliance
with
the
remedial
decree
and
whether
the
vestiges
of
discrimination
have
been
eliminated
to
the
extent
practicable.
the
court
of
appeals
reliance
on
the
fact
that
student
achievement
was
still
at
or
below
national
norms
at
many
grade
levels
is
not
an
appropriate
part
of
that
standard.
just
as
demographic
changes
independent
of
de
jure
segregation
will
affect
the
racial
composition
of
student
assignments,
so
too
will
numerous
external
factors
beyond
the
control
of
the
school
district
and
the
state
affect
student
achievement.

o?connor

opinion.
