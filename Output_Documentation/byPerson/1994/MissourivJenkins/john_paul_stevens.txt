justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
two
questions,
if
i
may
ask
you
very
briefly.
when
in
the
district
court
did
the
state
first
take
the
position
that
student
achievement
was
totally
irrelevant
to
the
issues
before
the
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
i
said
in
the
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
really?
but
as
i
understand
it,
earlier
in
the
proceedings
you
had
agreed
that
they
were,
or
at
least
you
had
accepted
the
proposition
that
the
district
court
was
going
to
rely
in
part
on
this
factor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
just
wondering
when
you
told
the
district
court
for
the
first
time
that
you
felt
it
was
totally
irrelevant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
never
asked
the
district
court
to
rule
squarely
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
a
factor
that
it
was
permissible
for
it
to
consider?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did
not
ever
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--my
second
question
is,
throughout
your
brief,
you
use
the
phrase,
the
dedicated
panel.
i
didn't
quite
understand
whether
you
were
challenging
the
integrity
of
the
panel
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
did
you
mean
by
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
misconstrued
by
me,
and
i
thought
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
phrase.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
every
panel
that
has
the
same
judges
over
and
over
again
a
dedicated
panel?
