even
if
it
happened,
then,
even
if
there
were
a
remarkable
increase
in
achievement
level,
that,
too,
would
be
irrelevant,
that
it
doesn't
matter,
even
if
you
could
show
a
remarkable
improvement,
that
would
not
qualify
you
in
any
way
to
be
released?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
glad
that
you've
clarified
that,
that
it's
irrelevant
either
way,
and
i
would
also
be
helped
if
you
could
point
to
the
precise
part
of
the
district
court's
order
that
you're
challenging,
because
there
seems
to
be
some
confusion.
two
of
the
members
of
the
dedicated
panel
on
the
eighth
circuit
thought
that
there
was
no
order
that
increased
test
scores
were
required.
i'm
sure
you're
familiar
with
the
part
of
the
clarification
that
two
of
the
judges
gave
on
rehearing.
it
was
that
test
scores
must
be
only
one
factor
in
the
equation.
so
where...
and
those
two
judges
also
said
nothing
in
the
district
court's
opinion
said
otherwise,
so
where
do
you
find
this
order
that
there
must
be
an
improvement
in
the
scores?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
shouldn't
we
take
it
as
the
law
of
the
case
that
nothing
in
the
district
court's
opinion
so
required,
that
what
was
said
with
regard
to
test
scores
is
that
there
a
factor
in
the
equation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
munich,
then
you're
saying
that
the
government
was
inaccurate
in
telling
us,
as
they
did
in
their
brief,
that
in
1985
you
joined...
the
state
joined
in
urging
the
district
court
to
order
programs
that
would
increase
student
level
achievements
at
the
both
elementary
and
secondary
level,
so
apparently
in
1985
you
thought
that
there
was
not
the
required
upgrading
of
the
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
no...
i'm
trying
to
determine
the
basis
for
your
saying
that
everything
was
up
to
snuff
in
1985,
because
it
seems
the
district
court
didn't
think
so,
and
from
what
the
government
represents
about
the
state's
position,
even
the
state
didn't
think
that
in
1985
you
were
in
full
compliance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
the
significance
of
your
not
repeating
the
questions
you
brought
up
then?
your
current
position
pinpoints
two
precise
questions,
and
it's
strikingly
different
from
your
petition
the
last
time
around,
when
you
did
present
to
the
court,
and
the
court
did
not
grant
cert
on,
the
broad
question.
now,
presented
with
the
broad
question,
the
court
denied
cert.
this
time,
you
chose
not
to
repeat
the
broad
question,
and
then
just
to
give
us
those
two
specific
questions.
i've
heard
of
bringing
in
narrower
questions
under
a
larger
umbrella,
but
how
do
you
present
the
narrower
questions
and
then
reach
up
to
the
large
question
that
you
didn't
repeat?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shaw,
could
you
be
more
specific
about
what
those
plans
that
were
called
for
were,
because
they
seemed
to
in
years
go
from
3
years
to
10
years.
the
district
court
said,
come
up
with
plans
to
get
the
state...
to
get
the
court
out
of
this,
and
why
3
years,
5
years,
7
years,
and
10
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
does
it
make
that
showing?
