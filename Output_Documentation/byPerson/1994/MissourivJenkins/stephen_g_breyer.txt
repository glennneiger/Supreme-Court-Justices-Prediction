i
do
actually
have
a...
i
want
to
go
back
to
your
initial
statement.
are
you
saying,
imagine
a
school
district
was
segregated
for
many
years,
and
as
a
result,
those
discriminated
against
could
not
read,
and
then
it
was
segregated.
why
isn't
it
at
least
relevant,
when
you're
asking
whether
the
desegregation
is
working,
that
you'd
look
at
some
point
to
see
if
they
can
read?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
honestly
saying
you
can't
look
to
see
if
they
can
read
now?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
suppose
it's
always
a
matter
of
argument
as
to
how
long
you
keep
having
to
dedicate
the
court's
efforts
to
see
that
the
school
system
is
functioning
properly,
and
in
trying
to
answer
that
question,
are
we
still
okay?
do
we
have
to
do
more?
in
trying
to
answer
that
question,
how
long,
can't
you
at
least
look
to
see
if
they
can
read
now?
