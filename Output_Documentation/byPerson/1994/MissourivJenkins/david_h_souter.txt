do
you
take
the
position
that
the
measurement
of
student
achievement
is
irrelevant
in
determining
whether
the
goals
have
been
met?
justice
david
h.
souter
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
irrelevant?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
green...
you...
i
take
it
you
would
accept
the
proposition
that
the
green
factors
are
not
exclusive?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
means
they're
not
exclusive.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
they
may,
indeed,
so
focus,
but
if
it
is
appropriate
to
look
at
some
point
to
educational
offerings
as
being
a
goal,
ultimate
or
intermediate,
then
why
is
it
irrelevant
to
look
to
the
measurement
of
whether
those
educational
offerings
are
having
any
effect
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
aren't
you
retreating
from
your
answer
to
me
a
moment
ago?
you
agreed
that
the
green
factors
were
not
exclusive.
you
seem
to
be
coming
back
to
the
position
that
nothing
but
allocation
is
resources,
which
i
take
to
be
a
green
factor
enumeration,
is
relevant.
you
conceded
a
moment
ago
that
there
is
more
that
may
be
relevant
than
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we
somehow
blind
ourselves
to
the
forest
for
the
trees,
here,
because
the
forest
is
the
elimination
of
the
vestiges
of
the
prior
de
jure
discrimination,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
you're
making
is
that
we
ignore
the
forest
for
the
trees,
and
by
and
large
the
trees
are
the
green
trees?
justice
david
h.
souter
where,
then,
in
your
analysis,
is
there
room
to
consider
the...
sort
of
the
ultimate
question
of
the
elimination
of
vestiges?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
would
not
challenge
that
finding
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
your
complaint
is
with
the
remedy,
but
your...
we
do
not
have
the
question
before
us
whether
that
goal,
whether
that
underlying
theory
to
which
the
remedy
relates,
was
legally
erroneous
or
not.
that's
over
and
done
with.
we
denied
cert
on
that
in
1989,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
only
question
we
come
back
to
is,
assuming
that
to
be,
as
it
were,
the
standard
of
the
case,
is
it
legally
irrelevant
that
the
test
scores
are
up,
down,
or
unchanged?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
significance
of
the
denial
of
cert
in
'89
if
they
are?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
related
question.
one
of
the
assumptions
is,
and
i
guess
one
of
the
findings
in
this
case
is,
that
one
of
the
effects
of
the
prior
de
jure
segregation
is
an
effect
in
sort
of
attitude
and
expectation
which
affects
the
performance
that
kids
in
school
actually
come
up
with,
and
the
assumption,
and
again
i
think
the
finding
here
is,
that
those
attitudes
and
expectations
and
attitudes
get
passed
on.
they
go
from
one
school
generation,
or,
indeed,
one
biological
generation
to
another,
and
it
takes
time
to
change
them.
do
you
deny
that,
a)
that
is
a
fact,
and
do
you
deny
that
that
is
a
relevant
consideration
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
of
whether
the
vestiges
of
de
jure
segregation
have
been
eliminated?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
you
accept
it
as
a
fact,
then,
and
you're
just
saying
it
should
not
be
a
legally
relevant
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we're
not
talking
about
discrimination
in
society
here,
we're
talking
about,
sort
of
expectations
about
what
can
be
achieved
in
school
which
just
get
passed
on
from
parents
to
children,
and
from
one
group
of
kids
to
another
group
of
kids.
and
so
it's
not...
i
think
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
not
that
present
racial
attitudes
are
sort
of
undermining
the
scheme.
i'm
just
saying
that
a
certain
set
of
attitudes
gets
passed
on,
and
i
take
it
you
say
as
a
factual
matter,
yes,
it's
true,
they
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
are
saying
that
it's
legally
irrelevant
and
shouldn't
be
considered
in
assessing
compliance
with
a
plan
like
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
it
be
irrelevant
if
it's
a
fact,
and
if
the
object
is
to
eliminate
the
vestiges,
why
should
that
be
irrelevant?
