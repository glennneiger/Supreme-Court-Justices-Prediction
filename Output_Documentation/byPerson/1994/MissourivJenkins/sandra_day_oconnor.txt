justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
munich,
there
was
an
order
entered
by
the
district
court,
i
take
it,
requiring
improved
student
achievement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
take
it
from
the
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case
that
we
are
not
asked
to
review
the
propriety
of
that
order?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
that...
we
are
not
asked
to
review
whether
that
order
was
proper
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
know,
i
thought
we
were
here
to
review
whether
the
state,
as
opposed
to
the
school
district,
should
have
partial
unitary
status.
i
mean,
i
thought
that
was
really
the
question
before
us,
and
whether
the
courts
below
examined
the
proper
factors
and
made
the
proper
determination
on
that
issue.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
much
in
your
brief
seemed
to
go
quite
beyond
that
and
reach
back
to
the
validity
of
the
order
that
was
initially
entered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
specific
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
do
you
want
us
to
reverse
here?
i
mean,
being
very
precise,
looking
at
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
what
is
it
you're
asking?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
excuse
me,
because
you
state
in
your
reply
brief
that
you
do
not
seek
a
declaration
of
partial
unitary
status,
so
please
tell
us,
as
simply
as
you
can,
precisely
what
it
is
you
are
saying,
you
are
asking
us
to
do
with
regard
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
shaw,
who
has
the
management
authority
over
the
schools
in
this
district?
is
it
the
state,
or
the
school
district,
basically?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there...
as
a
result,
are
there
any
differences
in...
for
the
district
court
to
consider
in
an
application
for
partial
unitary
status
made
by
the
state
as
opposed
to
the
school
district
itself?
in
other
words,
are
there
different
things
required
of
the
state
and
the
school
district
that
has
the
managing
authority?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
i
thought
there--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--actually
might
be,
that
the
state
might
be
responsible
more
for
the
provision
of
facilities
but
not
for
the
day-to-day
teaching
and
that
sort
of
thing
that
goes
on,
and
i
just
wondered
whether
that
has
to
be
taken
into
account.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
except
that
if
the
lower
courts
here
think
that
the
state
has
to
be
maintained
under
its
jurisdiction
here
until
certain
student
test
scores
reach
a
certain
level,
then
there
may
be
a
problem.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
agree
that
no
particular
level
of
achievement
could
be
the
sole
determining
factor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
shaw,
do
you
support
even
the
district
court's
order
increasing
salaries
of
noninstructional
employees--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
within
he
scope
of
the
remedy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
wonder
whether
it
might
not
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
go
that
far.
it
as
nothing
to
do
with
student
achievement
or
anything
else.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
just
quite
amazed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
those
things
were
before
the
district
court,
the
amount
of
money
that
had
been
spent
and
the
length
of
time?
are
you
suggesting
that
wasn't
presented,
or
argued,
or--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
on
the
salary
issue
it
seemed
like
it
was
just
a
very
convenient
way
for
the
school
district
and
the
labor
union
to
get
what
they
wanted
without
going
through
collective
bargaining,
and
there
are
some
very
unattractive
features--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
what
the
district
court
did
here,
and
the
state
is
just
left
holding
the
bag
because
the
school
district
and
the
labor
union
make
a
deal
with
the
court
that
the
court's
going
to
set
the
salaries.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
can't
be
relevant.
