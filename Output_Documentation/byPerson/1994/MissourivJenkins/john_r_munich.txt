mr.
john
r.
munich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
17-year-old
desegregation
case
involves
a
remedy
of
unprecedented
breadth
and
unparalleled
expense.
one
of
the
remedy's
central
aims
is
to
lure
nonminority
children
from
the
suburbs
to
the
district
for
the
express
purpose
of
altering
the
racial
balance
within
the
kansas
city
school
district.
in
pursuit
of
this
so-called
desegregative
attractiveness
goal
and
the
companion
objective
of
suburban
comparability,
one
of
the
orders
at
issue
here
today
requires
the
state
of
missouri
to
prove
that
a
quality
education
component
of
the
remedy
has
produced
improved
student
achievement.
in
the
other
orders
at
issue
today,
the
lower
courts
have
also
ruled
that
the
state
must
fund
salary
increases
for
noninstructional
personnel
of
the
kcmsd,
again
premised
on
the
same
goals
of
suburban
comparability
and
desegregative
attractiveness.
these
rulings,
and
the
underlying
goals
that
motivate
them,
far
exceed
the
scope
of
the
violation
found
in
this
case.
they
must
be
corrected
to
ensure
that
the
case
may
proceed
to
unitary
status
in
a
proper
and
orderly
fashion.
we
start
off
with
the
proposition
that
the
core
mandate
in
one
of
these
cases
is
to
eliminate
the
racially
identifiable
schools
from
the
district.
that
has
been
the
focus
since
green,
and
carried
through
in
dowell
and
freeman.
that
test
looks
to
whether
the
resources
and
the
students
in
the
district
have
been
allocated
in
a
race-neutral
fashion
to
the
extent
possible,
to
the
extent
practicable.
in
other
words,
has
everything
practically
been
done
to
ensure
that
students
are
assigned
to
schools
on
an
equitable
basis,
and
that
resources
are
assigned
to
schools--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
munich
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--at
the
outset,
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do,
though,
is
to
examine
today,
in
light
of
the
state's...
the
posture
of
this
case
for
unitary
status,
whether
the
goals
that
the
lower
courts
have
held
the
state
to
are
proper
today,
and
those
goals
are
what
we
view
as
the
interdistrict
goals
of
suburban
comparability
and--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and
we--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--i
think
the
posture
of
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
is
very
similar
to
what
the
court
confronted
in
spangler.
there,
there
had
been
initial
orders
and
goals
set
for
minority
to
majority
transfers
and
racial
balances
and
all
of
that.
the
court
said
that...
and
when
it
took
the
case,
it
would
not
review
the
validity
of
those
goals
back
then,
but
it
would
look
to
the
validity
of
those
goals
in
1974,
when
the
district
had
asked
to
be
relieved
of
the
order.
we
are
asking
for
the
same
thing
here.
we
are
not
saying
that
everything
that
has
already
happened
needs
to
be
undone,
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
goals
that
are
still
extant
in
these
orders,
these
interdistrict
goals,
go
beyond
the
scope
of
the
violation
here,
and
when
we
are
being
held,
when
the
state
of
missouri
is
being
held
to
those
goals,
that
the
court
must
look
at
those
in
the
context
of
the
question
of
whether
partial
unitary
status
should
be
ordered
and
what
the
standards
are,
more
importantly.
mr.
john
r.
munich
we
do,
your
honor.
for
the
purpose
of
unitary
status
there's
no
question
about
that.
we
believe
that
if
one--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--we
don't
think
it
is
relevant,
your
honor,
for
these
reasons.
first
off,
the
traditional
green
factors
that
the
court
has
historically
looked
at
deals
with
facilities--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--your
honor,
we
think
that
they
may
not
be
completely
exclusive.
however,
we
think
that
they--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--that's
correct,
your
honor--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--but
we
do
think
they
focus
on
allocation
of
resources
and
not
what
you
get
after
you
do
that,
and
we
think
the
reason--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--we
think
for
this
reason,
justice
souter.
educational
quality,
of
course,
was
one
of
the
things
the
district
court
looked
at
in
freeman,
and
it
looked
at
whether
resources
had
been
allocated,
textbooks,
faculty
assignments,
were
teachers
biased,
the
good
teachers,
the
better
quality
teachers
biased
in
favor
of
the
white
schools
or
the
black
schools,
and
those
are
the
types
of
things
that
we
believe
can
be
looked
at.
but
when
we're
talking
about
how
the
student
does,
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
that's
quite
a
different
story,
and
for
this
reason.
on
the
one
hand,
when
we
talk
about
a
school
district
that
makes
assignments,
that
is
asked
to
basically
allocate
resources
to
eliminate
racial
identifiability
in
the
schools,
it
can
do
that
by
executing
a
change
in
policy.
if
it
says,
the
boundary
line
shall
be
henceforth
moved,
it
happens.
if
it
says
that
the
athletic
league
shall
henceforth
be
unified,
it
happens.
on
the
other
hand,
when
we
are
talking
about
how
a
student
does,
those
inputs
that
the
school
board
introduces
are
filtered
through
individual
students
and
their
individual
talents,
volitions--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--we
think
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
we're
not
trying
to
have
both
sides
of
the
pie,
here.
if
resources
are
not
allocated
equally,
if
there
is
racial
identifiability
in
the
schools
because
of
the
way
resources
are
allocated,
we're
not...
the
state
should
not
be
left
off
the
hook
because
scores
have
gone
up
for
some
reason.
mr.
john
r.
munich
one
of
the
problems
here,
of
course,
justice
ginsburg,
is
the
fact
that
the
district
court
did
not
directly
address
the
state's
partial
unitary
status
in
the
order
that
it
issued
on
june
17,
1992.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
when
it
examined
the
state's
claims
on
appeal
was,
it
looked
not
only
at
that
order,
but
it
also
looked
at
several
other
orders
to
try
to
ascertain
from
those
whether
the
district
court
had
properly
analyzed
the
state's
freeman
arguments,
the
unitary...
partial
unitary
status
argument.
it
looked,
for
example...
this
is
in
the
petition
appendix
at
page
131,
where
the
district
court
relied
on
national
norms
in
another
order.
that's
the
april
16th,
'93
order.
mr.
john
r.
munich
well,
your
honor,
we
would...
it's
certainly
unclear,
as
you
point
out,
whether
it
is
a...
whether
the
panel
meant
it
is
a
factor
or
a
controlling
factor,
but
we
think
that
the
state's
view
is
that
either
way
it
should
not
be
considered
on
the
question
of
whether
unitary
status
is
at
hand,
that
the
whole
point
of
looking
at
whether
unitary
status
is
at
hand
is
a
question
of
whether,
again,
the
resources
within
the
district
have
been
allocated
properly.
the
eighth
circuit
standard,
even
if
we
read
it
narrowly
as
simply
a
relevant
factor,
we
think
does
an
injustice
to
that
standard.
mr.
john
r.
munich
we
think
that's
wrong,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
r.
munich
justice
souter,
let
me
make
sure
that
i'm...
that
my
answer
on
that
is
clear.
there
may
be
things
other
than
faculty
assignments,
extracurricular
activities,
facilities,
which
are
among
the
traditional
green
factors.
those
things
may
include,
we
think,
allocation
of
textbooks,
allocation
of
computers,
per
capita
spending...
in
freeman,
of
course,
there
was
some
question
whether
per
capita
spending
among
students
had
been
equalized.
we
think
that
those
things
can
properly
be
considered.
in
our
view,
they
are
probably
subsumed
within
the
six
green
factors
as
they
exist,
but
we
would
say...
we
would
concede
that
allocation
issues,
when
we're
talking
about
resources,
are
things
that
green
looks
to,
but
that--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--i
don't
think
that
would
be
the
result,
justice
souter.
mr.
john
r.
munich
we
think
that
the
elimination
of
vestiges,
to
the
extent
practical,
comes
about
by
the
allocation,
by...
first
by
the
allocation
of
equal
resources,
and--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--if
that
has
been
found
in
a
proper
case,
justice
kennedy,
that
is
correct,
and
that
gets
us
to
what--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--we're
not
saying
that
that's
a
clearly
erroneous
finding.
we
are
challenging
the
legal
sufficiency
of
it,
justice
souter.
but
to
get
back
to
your
question,
justice
kennedy,
we
think
that...
our
view
is
that
one
of
the
inherent
flaws
that
has
guided
the
lower
courts
below
is
a
commingling
of
the
analysis,
of
the
analyses
as
to
whether,
1)
whether
unitary
status
is
at
hand,
measured
by
the
green
factors,
and
as
i
say,
we
look...
we
believe
that
fairly
looks
to
whether
resources
have
been
allocated
equally.
the
point
that
your
honor
makes
i
think
is
the
second
point,
which
is
namely,
are
there
some
sort
of
educational
deficits
that
the
de
jure
system
have
visited
upon
minority
students?
the
problem,
we
think,
is
that...
and
that,
of
course,
is
milliken
ii.
the
problem,
we
think,
is
that
the
courts
below
have
not...
have
failed
to
distinguish
between
those
two
components
of
the
remedy,
and
that
is
why...
of
the
analysis,
and
that
is
why
we
have
rather
skewed
tests
as
to
when
the
remedy
should
end,
rather
skewed
goals
here
as
to
what
must
be
attained,
and
what
we
view,
in
essence,
as
an
open-ended
remedy.
mr.
john
r.
munich
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
r.
munich
in
this
case
the
initial
milliken
ii,
the
compen...
what
the
parties
refer
to
here
as
the
milliken
ii
components
were
implemented
in
the
beginning
of
1985,
'86.
mr.
john
r.
munich
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
r.
munich
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
the
other
thing
i
should
point
out
is
that
before
the
remedy
was
entered
in
this
case,
the
kansas
city
district,
beginning
in
1977,
implemented
its
own
voluntary
student
reassignment
policy.
it
was
a
massive
effort.
it
transferred...
involved
the
transfer
of
some
16,000
of
the
school
district's
41,000
students.
it
used
noncontiguous
zoning,
clustering,
pairing,
a
lot
of
the
same
types
of
things
that
were...
procedures
and
remedies
that
were
used
throughout
the
south
to
desegregate
heavily
segregated
school
districts.
that
has
been
going
on
since
1977
in
this
district.
mr.
john
r.
munich
after
liability
was
ordered...
found
here,
justice
ginsburg,
the
court
ordered
the
parties
to
come
forward
with
plans,
and
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
what
it
wanted
was
plans
that
would
be
addressed
to
student
achievement.
the
state,
of
course,
came
forward
with
such
plans.
i
should
add,
though,
that
the
point
here
is
that
on
two
occasions
at
least
the
state
challenged
whether
those
compensatory
plans,
or
those
remedial
plans,
could
be
applied
in
a
system-wide
fashion
such
as
we
have
here,
and
that--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--our
position
is
not,
justice
ginsburg,
that
we
were...
that
the
district
was
fully
equalized
as
of
1985.
that's
when
the
programs,
these
compensatory
or
remedial
programs
began.
the
point
that
i
may
have
been
unclear
on
was
that
prior
to
that,
at
least
in
the
student
assignment
arena,
there
had
been
massive
changes
going
on.
mr.
john
r.
munich
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
r.
munich
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
that's
where
we
parted
ways
with
the
district
court.
we
had
the
view
back
then,
and
still
take
the
view,
that
to
the
extent
there
were
identifiable
victims
of
the
de
jure
system
who
had
suffered
educational
deficits,
that
milliken
ii,
of
course,
makes
clear
that
something
extraordinary
can
be
done
for
them.
but
it
needs
to
be
targeted
to
those
victims,
and
one
of
our
complaints
with
this
remedy
is
that
this...
these
remedial
components
were
not
so
targeted.
mr.
john
r.
munich
i...
that
is
correct,
justice
souter,
it
was
denied.
mr.
john
r.
munich
justice
souter,
i
would
disagree
with
you
on
the
question
of
whether
that
question...
whether
those
goals
are
correctly
before
the
court
or
not.
we
think
that
it--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--i
think
it
has
no
significance,
your
honor.
i
think
that--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
difference
is
exactly
the
type
of
situation
that
occurred
in
spangler,
where
we
are
not
saying
today...
back
in
'88,
when
we
did
raise
the
issue
of
the
scope,
that
was
as
an
initial
matter
of
whether
these
remedies
should
go
forward
as
of
this
day,
and
the
court
denied
cert
on
that
issue,
but
we
do
not
think
today
in
1995
that
the
court
can
properly
examine
the
question
of
unitary
status
in
this
case
without
looking
at
those
underlying
goals.
indeed,
the
eighth
circuit,
when
it
analyzed
our
appeal
in
this
case,
said
that
it
had
to
look
at
those
goals
to
ensure
whether
we
had
been
held
to
them
properly
or
not,
and
the
eighth
circuit
did
in
fact
go
back,
and
one
of
the
things
it
did
was
look
at
whether
the
goals
of
desegregative
attractiveness
and
suburban
comparability
had
been
met.
and,
in
fact,
even
the
jenkins
respondents
argued
in
their
brief
at
page
25
that
the
state
had
the
burden
below
of
proving
that
the
quality
of
education
programs
had
achieved
their
remedial
goals,
so
we
think,
in
fact,
that
it
would
be
examining
this
question,
this
question
of
partial
unitary
status
here
and
what
the
standards
are,
with
blinders,
to
look
at
that
question
without
examining
the
eighth
circuit's
underlying
goals,
because--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--there
are
two
decisions,
justice
o'connor.
one
was
in
november
and
one
was
in
december
of
1993.
the
first
dealt
with
this
so-called
freeman
issue,
the...
and
the
salary
issue,
the
second
dealt
with
the
salary
issue,
also.
we
want
the
court...
or,
what
we
ask
the
court
to
do
is
to
reverse
both
those
orders
on
the
grounds
that...
on
the
first,
on
the
grounds--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--first,
to
reverse
the
orders.
second,
to
instruct
the
lower
courts
that
the
interdistrict
goals
of
suburban
comparability
and
desegregative
attractiveness
are
beyond
the
scope
of
this
intradistrict
case.
third,
to
instruct
the
lower
courts
that
the
compensatory
or
remedial
programs
in
this
case
must
be
limited
to
those
victims
of
segregation,
and
third
to...
and
last
to
make
sure
that
the...
to
make
clear
to
the
lower
courts
that
the
question
of
student
outcomes,
as
opposed
to
allocation
of
resources,
has
no
part
in
this
case.
mr.
john
r.
munich
that
may
suffice,
justice
scalia,
but
the
thing
that
i
need--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--that
would
probably
do
the
trick,
justice
scalia,
but--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--we
have
not...
my
office,
your
honor,
has
not
defended
any
such
claims.
i
don't
know
whether
anything
is
brewing
out
there
or
not.
obviously,
there
are
complaints
from
school--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--on
the
general
level
the
average
state-wide
is
somewhere
between
3,000
and
4,000
per
student,
justice...
chief
justice...
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
district,
there
is
some
question
whether
you
take
out
the
capital
costs
or
not,
but
it's
somewhere
between,
with
the
capital
we
would
say
about
13,500
as
of
1992,
'93.
if
you
take
the
capital
out,
somewhere
about
9,000
or
10,000.
mr.
john
r.
munich
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
r.
munich
i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
it
certainly
occurred
at
the
court
of
appeals
level.
mr.
john
r.
munich
one
of
the...
the
reason
i
answer
that
way
is
that
the
district
court
did
not
tell
us
when
the
state
moved
for
partial
unitary
status
that
that
was
the
standard
it
would
be
holding
the
state
to.
in
fact,
that
standard--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--on
the--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--on
the
milliken
ii
side,
justice
stevens,
we
did,
when
the
court
ordered
us
to,
propose
compensatory
programs
that
were
remedial
in
nature,
aimed
at
helping
students
out
with
extraordinary
educational
programs.
at
that
time,
though,
and
until...
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
until
this
court
of
appeals
decision
that...
november
'93
court
of
appeals
decision--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
that--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--again,
that
first
surfaced
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
r.
munich
it
didn't
occur
to
me
until--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--it
didn't
occur
to
me
until
after
we
wrote
that
that
that
could
be
misconstrued.
mr.
john
r.
munich
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
case
is
referred
to
as
a
dedicated
panel
because
the
same
three
judges
sit
on
every
appeal.
mr.
john
r.
munich
yes.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--for
a
couple
of
reasons,
justice
breyer.
mr.
john
r.
munich
we
think
that
that
is...
if
the
question
is
whether
the
state
has
done
what
it
can
do,
we
think
that
it's
inherently
impractical
to
ask
more
than
that
the
state
put
into
place
the
programs
that
the
experts
say
are
the
appropriate
ones
to
monitor
them,
to
make
sure
that
they're
funded
properly,
and
to
allow
the
students
to
proceed
through
their
academic
careers
in
those
programs.
mr.
john
r.
munich
we
don't
think,
justice
breyer,
that
that
should
be
the
analysis
that
the
court
undertakes,
for
this
reason.
it's
just...
again,
it's
inherently
impractical,
when...
the
respondents'
briefs
and
the
united
states'
briefs
even
concede
that,
for
example,
if
outcomes
are
flat,
that
may
either
mean
that
you've
done
all
you
can
do,
or
that
you
need
to
do
more,
and
it
simply
strikes
us
as
being
not
as
probative,
in
fact
probably
wholly
or
almost
wholly
nonprobative
as
compared
to
the
question
of
whether
you've
applied
the
proper
resources,
monitored
them,
funded
them,
and
made
sure
that
they're
in
place.
mr.
john
r.
munich
we
don't
think
that
that's
a
proper
consideration,
justice
souter,
because
we
think
that--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--it's
possible,
and
the
court's
opinions
have
certainly
held
that
there's
discrimination
out
there
in
society
that...
that
is
unfortunate--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--that
may
happen,
and
we
think
that
that--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--we
think
that's
right,
justice
souter.
it's
just
one
of
those
things
that--
mr.
john
r.
munich
--it's
one
of
those
things,
we
think,
justice
souter,
that
is
just
beyond,
as
swann
pointed
out,
the
capacity
of
the
schools
to
deal
with.
