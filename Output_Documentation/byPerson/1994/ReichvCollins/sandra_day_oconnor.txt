well,
is
georgia
now,
as
you
understand
it,
asserting
sovereign
immunity
and
just
saying,
we
do
not
waive
our
sovereign
immunity
for
backwardlooking
relief?
is
that
what
georgia
is
saying
today?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
this
suit
were
in
federal
court?
would
the
eleventh
amendment
enable
georgia
to
take
that
position
and
defeat
a
remedy
if
the
suit
were
in
federal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
say
that
if
the
suit
is
in
the
state's
own
court
it
can't
assert
sovereign
immunity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
also
a
potential
criminal
penalty
in
georgia
for
nonpayment
of
taxes
when
due?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
again,
there
are
no
cases,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
a
reasonable
taxpayer
in
georgia
in
the
1980's
have
assumed
that
a
post
deprivation
remedy
was
available
by
way
of
refund
for
an
unconstitutional
tax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
for
many
years
federal
retirees
such
as
the
petitioner
charles
reich
paid
georgia
income
tax,
on
their
federal
retirement
benefits.
even
now,
georgia
exempted
state
retirees
from
paying
income
tax
on
their
state
retirement
benefits.
in
1989,
we
held
in
a
case
called
davis
versus
michigan
department
of
the
treasury,
that
such
a
state
tax
scheme
violates
the
constitutions
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
doctrine.
relying
on
a
georgia
statute
that
requires
refunds
for
illegally
assessed
taxes,
right
and
other
georgia
federal
retirees
for
suit
in
georgia
state
court,
seeking
refunds
of
the
unconstitutional
taxes
they
had
paid
in
the
years
before
the
1989
decision
of
this
court.
the
trial
court
denied
the
refund
claims
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
affirmed
holding
for
the
first
time
that
the
state's
refund
statute
does
not
apply
where
as
here
taxes
are
paid
under
a
state
scheme
that
is
subsequently
declared
to
be
unconstitutional.
right
eventually
petition
this
court
for
review
of
that
decision
on
the
ground
that
even
if
a
georgia
statute
did
not
require
refunds.
federal
due
process
does
as
established
in
our
line
of
this
court's
decisions
most
recently
our
1990
mckesson
decision.
we
granted
the
writ
of
certiorari
and
remanded
the
case
back
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
to
reconsider
it's
decision
in
light
of
the
mckesson
line
of
cases.
on
remand
the
georgia
supreme
court
again
denied
refunds
to
the
plaintiffs.
this
time
on
the
grounds
that
on
the
georgia
high
court's
reading
of
the
mckesson's
cases,
the
georgia
federal
retiree
should
have
challenged
the
disputed
taxes
before
paying
them
under
procedures
that
georgia
says,
it
provides
for
that
purpose.
we
now
hold
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
erred
in
relying
on
georgia's
predeprivation
procedures
to
deny
relief.
the
court
was
no
doubt
right,
that
under
the
mckesson
cases
a
state
may
require
taxpayers
to
challenge
unconstitutional
taxes
before
paying
them
rather
than
after
but
what
a
state
may
not
do
and
what
georgia
did
here
is
to
reconfigure
its
remedial
scheme
unfairly
in
midcourse.
specificaly
throughout
the
1980s,
georgia
held
out
what
plainly
appeared
to
be
a
clear
and
certain
postdeprivation
remedy.
its
tax
refund
statute
and
then
it
declared
only
after
right
and
others
like
him
had
paid
the
disputed
taxes
that
no
such
remedy
existed.
in
this
regard
the
georgia
supreme
court's
reliance
on
georgia's
predeprivation
procedures
was
beside
the
point
because
even
assuming
a
constitutional
adequacy
of
these
procedures;
no
reasonable
taxpayer
would
have
thought
they
represented
the
exclusive
remedy
for
unconstitutional
taxes.
accordingly
the
judgment
has
reversed
and
the
cases
remanded
for
the
provision
of
meaningful
backward
looking
relief
consistent
with
due
process.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
