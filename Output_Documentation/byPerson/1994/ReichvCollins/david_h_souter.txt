justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
agree
that
if
the
state's
insurance
consisted
of
a
lien
and
interest
running
on
any
unpaid
balance
at
something
substantially
equivalent
to
market
rate,
that
that
would
create
no
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
subject
to
12
percent
a
year
and
the
25
percent
penalty,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
a
penalty
up
to
25
percent?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
nobody
can
tell
in
advance
whether
it
will
be
asserted
or
not,
so
i
mean,
it
has
to
be
considered.
there's
no
way...
in
other
words,
there's
no
way
to
guard
against
its
imposition,
i
take
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
on
the
theory
that
a
state
official
will
not
act
unreasonably
to
penalize
a
taxpayer?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
henson,
would
you
address
the
question
of
how
far
back
a
taxpayer
could
go?
