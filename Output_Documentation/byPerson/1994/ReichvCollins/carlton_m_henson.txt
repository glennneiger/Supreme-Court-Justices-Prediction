mr.
carlton
m.
henson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
is
yet
another,
and
hopefully
the
last,
in
a
series
of
cases
involving
the
state's
unconstitutional
taxation
of
federal
retirement
benefits.
since
at
least
1985,
when
federal
retirees
first
filed
suit
in
georgia.
federal
retirees
across
this
country
have
been
trying
to
collect
refunds
of
taxes
that
were
illegally
and
unconstitutionally
collected
from
them
by
the
states.
in
1989
in
davis,
this
court
confirmed
that
a
state
may
not
impose
an
income
tax
on
federal
retirement
benefits
if
it
simultaneously
provides
an
exemption
from
state
retirement
benefits.
two
years
later
in
barker,
the
court
confirmed
that
the
holding
in
davis
applied
to
military
retirement
benefits,
and
in
1993,
in
harper,
this
court
confirmed
that
its
decision
in
davis
must
be
applied
retroactively.
harper,
however,
stopped
short
of
awarding
refunds.
thus,
after
almost
a
decade
of
effort
by
federal
retirees,
this
case
ultimately
presents
the
question
of
whether
the
constitution
requires
refunds
to
federal
retirees
under
the
circumstances
here
presented.
this
question
has
already
been
answered
in
the
affirmative
by
this
court.
as
the
court
held
in
mckesson,
our
precedents
establish
that
if
a
state
penalizes
taxpayers
for
failure
to
remit
their
taxes
in
timely
fashion,
the
due
process
clause
requires
the
state
to
afford
taxpayers
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
secure
post
payment
relief.
further,
the
court
held
that
if
a
state
avails
itself
of
this
approach,
establishing
various
sanctions
and
summary
remedies
designed
so
that
taxpayers
tender
tax
payments
before
the
objections
are
entertained
and
resolved,
the
state
does
not
provide
a
meaningful
predeprivation
hearing.
georgia
does
not
dispute
that
it
has
established
summary
sanctions,
summary
remedies
and
sanctions
here,
nor
does
it
dispute
that
the
purpose
of
these
sanctions
and
remedies
is
designed
to
ensure
payment.
on
page
30
of
the
brief
of
the
respondents,
they
write,
"georgia's
statutory
provisions
concerning
the
nonpayment
of
taxes
are
all
reasonable
measures
designed
to
see
that
taxes
are
paid
if
they
are
legally
owed.
"
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
without
triggering
the
requirement
to
provide
meaningful--
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
--backwardlooking
relief?
o'connor
talks
about
reasonably
equal
terms,
and
harper
references
constitutionally
significant
duress,
so
by
implication
there's
some
level
where
there
is
constitutionally
insignificant
duress,
or
the
terms
might
be
unequal
but
not
reasonably
unequal.
i
don't
have
a
specific
formula
to
present
to
the
court.
if
the
states
are
looking
for
a
bright
line
rule,
then
i
think
parity
is
one
that's
fairly
read
from
the
cases,
but
this
case
is
far
beyond
anything
that
the
court--
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
--i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
mckesson
clearly
holds
that.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
i
think
that's
clear
from
mckesson,
your
honor.
the
sanctions
that
the
state
has
here,
though,
are
much
more
severe
than
just
some
minimal
requirement
that
the
taxpayer
pay
under
protest.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
i
think
that's
a
closer
case,
your
honor.
i
think
that
probably
would
satisfy
the
mckesson
standard.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
by
itself,
no
financial
sanctions,
no
penalty,
in
that
case,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
very
much
like
the
chief
justice's
payunderprotest
hypothetical,
basically.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
well--
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
the
question.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
that,
to
my
ear
that
sounds
like
he
runs
afoul
of
mckesson.
that...
that
is
more
than
just
the...
more
than
just
insignificant
duress.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
that's
a
real
cost
that
the
taxpayer
begins
to
bear
there.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
that's
right.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
all
right.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
i
think
you're
right,
your
honor.
of
course,
what
we
have
here
is
far
more
severe
than
either
of
those
hypotheticals.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
ex
post
facto?
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
i
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
your
honor.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
well,
it
was
rep...
effectively,
yes.
there
was
absolutely
no
doubt
that
the
refund
statute
applied
to
these
federal
retirees,
and
the
respondents
repeatedly
wrote
in
briefs
before
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
in
other
courts
of
georgia
that...
there
were
georgia
supreme
court
cases
on
point.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
if...
if
that
was
the
case,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor,
except
here,
both
the...
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
clearly
established
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
provide
for
refunds
of
taxes
that
were
later
declared
unconstitutional.
the
georgia
supreme
court
had
issued
a
decision
in
the
parke,
davis
case
that
expressly
held
that
the
refund
statute
was
the
appropriate
procedure
for
challenging
an
unconstitutional
tax
under
the
federal
constitution,
in
that
case
a
commerce
clause
challenge.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
so--
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
--precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
the
rule
this--
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
--that
does
seem
to
be
their
latest
idea,
your
honor.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
i
think
we
would
have
a
problem
under
the
eleventh
amendment
with
respect
to
the
department
of
revenue
as
a
defendant.
with
respect
to
the
individual
claims
against
marcus
collins
as
the
revenue
commissioner,
my
understanding
of
the
court's
jurisprudence
is
that
we
would
not.
i
think
that--
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
--well,
no,
your
honor,
not
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
and
particularly
here.
you
know,
they
put
this
forward
as
a
threshold
issue
regarding
the
state's
interpretation
of
its
own
sovereign
immunity.
well,
presumably
the
georgia
supreme
court
is
part
of
the
sovereign,
and
presumably
it's
a
pretty
good
arbiter
of
what
the
sovereign
immunity
would
be,
but
they
stepped
right
over
that
threshold.
they
didn't
hesitate
for
a
nanosecond
to
get
to
the
merits
of
this
issue.
they
didn't
have
any
problem
with
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
i'm
not
suggesting
for
a
moment,
your
honor,
that
the
state
can
close
the
door.
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
this
court
need
not
reach
that
issue
here
because
the
georgia
supreme
court
did
not
reach
it.
however,
i
do
believe
that
this
court's
precedents
establish
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
prevails
over
sovereign
immunity
in
cases
such
as
this.
carpenter
v.
shaw
is
this
case.
it
was
a
case
brought
against
the
oklahoma
state
auditor.
it
was
a
case
where
the
court
recognized
that
refunds
were
going
to
be
paid
out
of
the
state
treasury.
the
court
had
no
problem
awarding
refunds
in
this
case.
in
ward
v.
love,
it
was
a
case
involving
a
county
defendant,
but
the
court
expressly
distinguished
the
sovereign
immunity
issues
raised
in
ex
parte
young.
it
said,
this
is
not
ex
parte
young
because
this
is
a
takings
case
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
i'm
not
sure
i
under--
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
--well,
i
believe
the
court's
jurisprudence
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
area
is
what
answers
the
question
for
this
case.
i'm
not
familiar
enough
with
the
court's
decisions
under
the
tort
claims
act
that
would
resolve
that
for
other
areas,
but
i
think
the
carpenter
v.
shaw,
ward
v.
love,
the
bank
cases,
i
think
they
clearly
answer
that
question,
at
least
for
unconstitutional
deprivation
through
taxing
and,
indeed,
i
think
the
rule
that
the
court
has
enunciated
in
mckesson
has
been
consistently
applied,
and
i
don't
think
the
state
really
disputes,
as
i
pointed
out,
that
it
has
these
sanctions,
it
has
these
remedies.
indeed,
much
of
the
state's
briefing
is
designed,
or
answers,
deals
with
this
issue
of
this
critical
need
to
have
sanctions
and
summary
remedies,
but
that
issue's
been
decided.
that's
not
the
issue
here.
as
the
court
noted
in
mckesson,
the
court
has
long
held
that
the
state
may
impose
such
sanctions
and
remedies
in
tax
cases,
but
if
a
state
establishes
those
sanctions
and
summary
remedies,
it
does
not
provide
a
meaningful
predeprivation
hearing.
in
mckesson,
the
court
described
the
meaningful
predeprivation
hearing
again
as
the
root
requirement
of
due
process,
and
when
a
state
does
not
provide
this
root
requirement,
it
must
provide
backwardlooking
relief.
that's
the
tradeoff.
that's
the
price,
and
it's
not
a
tremendous
or
high
price.
virtually
every
state
has
some
sort
of
refund
statute.
the
united
states
government
has
a
refund
statute.
even
georgia
has
a
refund
statute.
it
just
doesn't
apply
here.
but
that's
not
good
enough
for
the
states.
they
want
you
to
say
that
you
really
didn't
mean
it
in
mckesson.
they
want
to
have
it
both
ways.
they
want
you
to
overrule
mckesson
and
harper.
they
want
to
have
their
cake
and
eat
it,
too.
in
short,
they
want
you
to
change
the
rules,
and
why,
because
they've
changed
the
rules
on
the
retirees
over
and
over
and
over
again.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
no,
your
honor,
because
of
the
summary
remedies
and
sanctions
that
the
state
has
established,
and
they
concede
in
their
brief
they've
established
these,
and
they
concede
that
the
purpose
of
these
is
to
require
taxpayers
to
make
payment.
they
are
constitutionally
permissible,
but
because
the
state
chooses
to
have
these
remedies,
it
must
provide
meaningful
backwardlooking
relief.
i
mean,
that's
the
issue,
is--
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
their
argument.
however,
that
does
not
comply
with
this
court's
statements
in
o'connor
and
mckesson.
all
the
while,
while
you're
litigating
your
claim
in
georgia,
you're
subject
to
criminal
prosecution,
you're
subject
to
the
possibility
of
a
penalty,
you're
subject
to
12
percent
interest,
you're
subject
to
levy,
execution,
and
garnishment.
they
would
have
the
taxpayer
run
the
risk
of
all
those
sanctions
in
the
hopes
that
in
the
end
the
taxpayer
might
win.
that
is
a
far
cry
from
what
justice
holmes
talked
about
as
reasonably
equal
terms
in
o'connor.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
there
is
none
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
he's
just
out
of
luck.
i
mean,
he's
lost
his
property.
if
they
come
and
garnish
his
bank
account--
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
--there's
none
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor,
and
there's
none
reflected
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
was
my
mistake.
i
foolishly
believed
that
the
refund
statute
applied
in
this
case,
and
that
the
limitation
period
in
the
refund
statute
would
preclude
us
from
going
back,
so
when
we
appealed
from
the
trial
court,
the
trial
court
applied
the
refund
statute
to
this
petitioner
and
said,
the
limitation
period
precludes
you.
i
thought
it
was
so
clear
that
it
applied,
i
did
not
appeal
that
part
of
the
judgment,
so
those
tax
years
are
not
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
i'm...
i'm--
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
[laughter]
no,
not--
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
--in
short,
georgia,
what
georgia
really
wants
here
is
the
discretion
to
pick
and
choose
when
it
wants
to
apply
its
refund
statute.
if
you're
a
federal
retiree
with
a
constitutional
claim,
the
refund
statute
doesn't
apply
to
you.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
you're
a
liquor
distiller
like
the
folks
in
beam,
and
you've
got
a
claim
based
on
the
u.s.
constitution
there
also,
well,
guess
what,
the
refund
statute
applies
to
you,
but
we're
sorry,
folks,
the
limit...
the
procedural
barriers
there
preclude
you
from
having
standing.
but
if
you
happen
to
be
a
taxpayer
who
pays
a
sales
tax
on
a
private
sale
of
used
cars
in
georgia,
and
you
say
that
that
tax
violates
state
law,
georgia
wants
to
be
able
to
say,
well,
of
course,
your
claim
violates
state
law.
of
course
our
refund
statute
applies
to
you,
and
here's
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
in
refund
for
you
folks.
after
almost
10
years,
it's
time
to
stop
changing
the
rules.
what
georgia
and
the
other
states
seem
to
have
overlooked
is
that
it's
not
the
role
of
courts
to
change
the
rules,
but
to
apply
the
rules,
and
a
straightforward
application
of
the
rule
in
mckesson,
o'connor,
and
harper,
requires
the
entry
of
judgment
in
favor
of
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
well,
that's
an
interesting
point,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that
proposition.
mckesson
and
harper
are
very
similar
to
the
case
here
in
that
regard,
because
in
both
instances
the
whole
predicate
of
the
cases
being
here
was
that
the
state
refund
statute
did
not
apply
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
so
if
it
doesn't
apply
in
harper
and
mckesson,
yet
the
court
sovereign
immunity
does
not
preclude
the
court
reviewing
it,
then
why
should
it
preclude
review
here,
and
i
think
the
answer
is,
it
doesn't.
it's
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim.
that's
the
way
the
court
treated
it
in
mckesson.
that's
the
way
it
treated
it
in
harper,
and
that's
the
way
it
is
here,
and
that's
consistent,
as
i
suggested,
with
the
court's
jurisprudence
beginning
with
o'connor,
carpenter
v.
shaw,
ward
v.
love,
and
those
cases.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
i'm
not--
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
--i'm
not
sure
that
it
does.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
authorities,
and
i
don't
think
it
does.
if
it's
illegal
under
federal
law,
it's
illegal.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
yes,
your
honor.
the
limitation
period
that's
applicable
to
taxpayers,
for
taxpayers
besides
the
particular
petitioner,
is
unresolved.
in
briefs
both
parties
have
argued
at
different
points
in
time
in
this
case
that
the
money
had
and
received
statute
would
be
the
most
analogous
limitation
period,
which
would
be
4
years,
and
would
either...
depending
on
when
you
started
it
would
either
be
tax
years
'85
through
'89,
or
tax
years
'84
through
'89,
and
there
is
an
issue
with
regard
to
tolling,
because
some
40,00
retirees
relied
on
georgia's
refund
statute,
which
makes
you
wait
a
year
before
you
file
suit.
so,
for
example,
this
suit
did
not
arise
until
april
of
1990,
rather
than
in
the
weeks
right
after
davis
was
decided,
so
that...
you
know,
in
this
case
the
state
has
not
disputed,
as
far
as
i
read
their
briefs,
that
the
tax
years
'85
through
'89
are
properly
before
the
court.
i'd
like
to
address
briefly
justice
breyer's
question,
and
that
is
the
issue
of
remand.
the
court
did
remand
in
mckesson,
and
the
court
remanded
in
harper,
and
the
state's
response
in
both
of
those
cases
has
been
to
continue
to
deny
relief
to
the
taxpayers.
in
the
record...
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
georgia
will
do
any
better
if
those
questions
are
left
open.
iowa
bank
and
the
montana
national
bank
cases
are
both
instances
where
the
court
said,
refunds
are
appropriate.
the
states
have
had
a
chance
to
look
at
it.
the
state
didn't
do...
didn't
choose
an
appropriate
remedy.
the
georgia
legislature
has
met
in
special
session
to
address
davis.
it
provide
only
prospective
relief.
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
had
this
case
twice
since
davis
was
decided
and
mckesson
was
decided,
and
still
has
denied
relief.
in
short,
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
question,
enough
is
enough.
these
people
are
entitled
to
refunds.
thank
you.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
state
can
come
in
at
this
date
and
talk
about
sovereign
immunity.
as
i
responded
to
the
chief's
question
earlier,
i
believe
this
court's
fourteenth
amendment's
jurisprudence
covers
that,
but
also,
in
georgia,
georgia
allows
under...
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
allows
takings
claims
brought
directly
against
the
state,
and
there's
no
state
sovereign
immunity,
and
if
they
were
going
to
say,
well...
i
mean,
it's
the
same
thing
all
over
again.
they
want
to
say,
well,
you
can
have
a
direct
takings
claim
against
the
state
of
georgia
based
on
state
law
and
based
on
the
state
constitution,
and
we
won't
assert
sovereign
immunity,
but
if
you
want
to
assert
it
based
on
the
federal
constitution,
we're
going
to
raise
state
sovereign
immunity,
and
the
authorities
for
that
are
cfi
construction
v.
board
of
regents,
it's
145
georgia
appeals
471,
a
1978
case,
and
state
board
of
education
v.
drewery,
drewery,
263
georgia
429.
they
just
want
to
change
the
rules
over
and
over
again.
it's
time
to
stop.
these
people
are
entitled
to
refunds.
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
and
perhaps--
mr.
carlton
m.
henson
--many
of
them
already
won't,
your
honor.
i
estimate
that
at
least
15
or
20
percent
have
already
died
since
davis.
thank
you.
