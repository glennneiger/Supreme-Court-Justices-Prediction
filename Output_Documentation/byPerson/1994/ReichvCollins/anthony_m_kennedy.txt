justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
posting
of
a
bond?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
when
you
say
no
penalty,
does
that
assume
that
if
the
taxpayer
prevails,
he's
entitled
to
reimbursement
for
the
bond
premium?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
he's
out
the
bond
premium?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
taxpayer
has
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
the
bond
premium,
and
there's
no
reimbursement
in
the
event
he
prevails.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes.
he
could
pay
under
protest--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
just
ask
a
little
bit
about
what
we
have
here.
suppose
you
have,
hypothetically,
a
state
with
an
adequate
predeprivation
remedy,
and
it
also
has
a
refund
statute.
the
taxpayer
elects
the
refund
route,
and
the
refund
statute's
repealed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
what
happened
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
incidentally,
if
that
were
to
happen,
what
is
the
mechanism
for
the
taxpayer
to
get
redress.
suppose
his
property
is
seized
pending
the
assessment
procedure,
and
then
he
wins
in
the
assessment
procedure.
what
is
the
statutory
mechanism
for
repayment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
there
been
any
administrative
practice
of
paying
the
money
back
if
it's
been
seized
and
the
assessment
procedure
continues?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
one
of
the
bases
for
the
supreme
court
of
georgia's
opinion
that
an
injunctive
action
could
have
been
brought?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
statute
on
page
20
of
the
blue
brief,
georgia
48-7-84,
on
its
face
says
no
action
for
the
purpose
of
restraining
the
assessment
shall
be
maintained
in
any
court.
it's
hard
for
me
to
square
that
with
our
requirement
that
there
be
a
clear
avenue
of
predeprivation
relief
for
the
taxpayer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
the
georgia
supreme
court
might
be
wrong
in
saying
there's
an
injunctive
possibility
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
was
clear
to
the
taxpayer
at
the
time,
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
cites,
as
i
recall,
a
sales
tax
case,
beam,
and
this
is
a
statute
that
applies
to
income
tax.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
injunctive
action
is
a
remedy,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
the
injunctive
action
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
suggests
was
available
to
the
plaintiff
was
clear
and
certain
before
that
opinion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
does
your
computer
follow
georgia
law?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
that
have
subjected
him
to
criminal
penalties,
if
he
omits
it
from
the
return?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
that
exactly
what...
i
thought
that's
exactly
what
he
did
here.
he
said
it's
owing
under
the
georgia
statute,
but
the
georgia
statute
is
unconstitutional.
isn't...
that's
just
the
substance
of
what
you've
just
described,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
that
he
should
have
done
something
other
than
he
did
in
his
return.
