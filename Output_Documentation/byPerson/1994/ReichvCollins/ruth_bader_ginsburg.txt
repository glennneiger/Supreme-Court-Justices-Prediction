justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
the
problem
that
georgia
supreme
court
said,
no,
it
doesn't
apply
to
a
constitutionally
invalid
tax,
that's
what
our
law
is
now,
that's
what
our
law
was
then,
and
we
have
the
same
right
to
take
the
position,
in
fact
obligation,
that
everything
we
say
about
what
the
law
is,
was,
is
fully
retroactive,
the
same
right
and
obligation
that
the
u.s.
courts
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
the
system
that
georgia
now
has
in
place...
let's
say
there
has
been
no
appearance
that
there
was
a
refund
remedy
available,
and
what
georgia
now
lists
as
its
remedies
is
all
there
is,
and
it's
clear
that
in
this
class
of
cases
there's
no
refund
remedy.
would
the
list
of
remedies
that
georgia
sets
out
and
says
it
now
has
for
this
category
of
cases,
would
that
be
constitutionally
adequate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
the
state
saying
that
if
you...
if
there's
been
an
assessment
and
you
appealed
it
successfully,
you
would
lose
nothing,
you
would
not...
there
would
be
no
penalty,
and
the
only
thing
you
would
lose
is
the
bond
premium?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
you
correctly
that
you're
not
seeking
a
refund
back
to
1980,
that
it's
only
3
years
back
from
the
first
time
you
made
a
protest
noise,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
where
is
it
established
that
that
determination
one
way
or
another
by
the
georgia
commissioner
would
be
reviewable
in
court?
you
said
it
would
be
reviewable
in
court,
the
reasonableness
of
the
taxpayer's
erroneous
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
one
of
the...
a
reviewable
item
would
be
the
commissioner's
discretion
about
whether
this
was
a
reasonable
action
on
the
taxpayer's
part?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't
this
petitioner
try
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
and
wasn't
he
thrown
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
there's
no
remedy
if
you
overpay,
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
didn't
the
latest
bill
that
he
got
include
a
penalty
assessment?
didn't
it
have
the
interest
and
penalty
on
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
an
automatic
assessment
of
a
penalty?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
it
was
conceded
in
this
case
that
you
could
go
back
only
to
1985.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting
that
in
a
whole
line
of
cases,
including
the
brandeis
decision
in
iowades
moines
national
bank
v.
bennett,
that
there
was
an
initial
step
that
was
just
skipped
over?
didn't
brandeis
say
in
that
case
taxpayer
complaints
about
unequal
treatment,
the
state
can
remedy
it
in
one
of
two
ways,
either
give
him
a
refund
or
tax
his
neighbor,
but
the
state's
got
to
do
one
or
the
other?
or
not
because
he
was...
did
he
just
overlook
the
threshold
question
of
sovereign
immunity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think
the
state
really
has
waived
it's
sovereign
immunity?
a
state
can
consent
to
be
sued.
it
went
right
to
the
question,
engaged
the
due
process
question.
