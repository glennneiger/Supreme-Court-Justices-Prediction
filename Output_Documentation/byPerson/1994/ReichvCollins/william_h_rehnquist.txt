we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
93-908,
charles
reich
v.
marcus
e.
collins.
mr.
henson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
henson,
in
your
view,
what
can
a
state
do
to
ensure
that
taxes
are
paid
without
running
afoul
of
this
coercion,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
a
state
require
payment
under
protest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
payment,
rather
than
just
protest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
henson,
what
if
we
decide
this
point
the
way
you
want
us
to.
is
that
going
to
open
the
states
up,
states
if
they
don't
have
a
tort
claims
act?
are
they
going
to
be
met
with
the
argument,
well,
if
we're
injured,
we've
got
a
right
to
sue
you
for
whatever
damages
we've
got,
even
though
you
haven't
waived
sovereign
immunity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
sovereign
immunity
is
not
a
defense
on
the
part
of
the
state,
even
though...
which
has
not
waived
it
for
a
claim
for
a
tax
refund,
how
about
a
constitutional
claim,
or
asserted
claim
for
other
kinds
of
injuries,
personal
injuries,
say,
at
the
behest
of
a
state
vehicle,
or
something
like
that?
why
wouldn't
that
argument
be
equally
available
to
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mckesson
did
not
involve
a
case
where
the
state
had
not
waived
its
sovereign
immunity,
did
it?
i
mean,
in
florida
the
state
had
waived
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
henson.
mr.
calvert,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you're
saying
there
are
cases
which
the
taxpayer
has
lost
on
the
merits
before
the
commissioner,
but
which...
in
which
he
did
not
attempt
to
impose
any
penalty?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
calvert.
mr.
henson,
you
have
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
henson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
reich
against
collins
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
