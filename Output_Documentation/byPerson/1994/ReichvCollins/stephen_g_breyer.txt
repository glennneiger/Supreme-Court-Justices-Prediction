isn't
there...
aren't
there
two
prior
controlling
decisions?
as
i
read
the
brief,
there
was
a
case
called
wright,
and
a
case
called
henderson.
i
looked
at
those
georgia
cases,
and
it
seemed
as...
my
first
reaction
was
both
of
those
cases
held
that
the
reason
a
person
couldn't
enjoin
an
unconstitutional
tax
in
georgia
is
because
there's
a
perfectly
good
remedy
for
him
to
get
a
refund
later.
and
just
to
be
sort
of
absolutely
definite
about
it,
one
of
them
quoted
the
governor,
who
sent
a
message
when
he
passed
this
refund
statute,
and
the
governor
said,
i'm
sending
you
over
this
statute
to
pass
because
certain
taxes
have
been
paid
into
the
state
treasury
under
laws
that
have
been
declared
unconstitutional,
and
so
i'm
passing
this
statute
so
that
you'll
have
a
remedy.
so
it
wasn't
as
if
they
came
into
court
with
an
open
question.
i
mean,
don't
we
have
here
this
extreme
case?
if
we
do
have
the
extreme
case,
what
do
we
do
next?
that
is,
suppose
that
we
decided
this...
so
i
really
have
two
questions.
do
you
want
to
deal
with
the
first
and
then
ask
the
second?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
haven't
asked.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
that
we
think
they've
been
getting
what
you
might
call
colloquially
the
runaround.
i
gather
that
if
the
state
has
money
that
belongs
to
them
under
the
substantive
constitutional
law,
they
would
like
to
get
it
back.
assuming
that's
so,
they
say
here
they've
tried
this
route.
the
refund
statute
suddenly
is
interpreted
against
them.
all
right,
suppose
you
lose
on
that.
from
your
brief,
it
appears
you're
going
to
assert
sovereign
immunity
next.
i
don't
quite
know
how
you
do
that,
since
it's
a
state
court,
not
a
federal
court.
the
eleventh
amendment
doesn't
apply.
and
then
i
take
it
you
have
several
other
things
that
you're
not
telling
us
about,
but...
or
you
might.
what
should
we
do
as
a
remedy
if
we
think
what
the
state
is
done
is
awfully
unfair,
unfair
to
the
point
where
it
falls
within
mckesson?
what
should
this
court
do?
should
this
court
say,
for
example,
just
pay
them,
enough
is
enough?
do
we
have
authority
to
do
that?
what
do
we
do
about
other
people?
i
mean,
since
you
have
no
refund
statute
which
happened
to
limit
refunds
to
3
years,
is
there
now
no
limitation?
and
since
you've
interpreted
that
away,
anyone
who
ever
has
paid
this
tax
can
bring
a
lawsuit?
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
next,
in
your
view,
assuming
you
lose
on
the
merits?
i'm
not
saying
you
will,
but
i'm
just
saying,
assuming
that.
