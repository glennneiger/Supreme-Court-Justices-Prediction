mr.
warren
r.
calvert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
as
recognized
in
harper,
a
state
which
has
provided
predeprivation
due
process
to
a
taxpayer
is
under
no
obligation
to
return
amounts
which
the
taxpayer
chooses
instead
to
pay,
even
if
it
is
subsequently
determined
that
the
tax
in
question
was
unconstitutional.
now,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
had
available
to
him
under
georgia
law
numerous
predeprivation
remedies
by
which
he
could
have
contested
georgia's
income
tax
treatment
of
his
federal
retirement
benefits.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
georgia
does
provide
for
12
percent
annual
interest
in
the
event
the
taxpayer
loses,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
there's
the
possibility
of
an
assertion
of
a
penalty.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
the
way
one
guards
against
its
imposition,
your
honor,
is
to
assert
reasonable
arguments
only.
the
statute
by
its
terms
provides
that
the
penalty--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
the
question,
your
honor,
is
whether
the
taxpayer's
position
was
reasonable.
the
code
section
provides
the
penalty
may
not
properly
be
imposed
if
the
failure
to
pay
was
due
to
reasonable
cause.
now,
of
course,
initially,
the
state
revenue
department,
when
it
issues
its
assessment,
makes
its
own
evaluation
of
the
reasonableness
of
a
taxpayer's
position,
but
ultimately
that's
a
question
for
the
courts
to
decide.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
and
i
say
that...
there
are
no--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--there
are
no
cases
that
have
interpreted
that
section,
your
honor,
and
i
submit
the
reason
that's
the
case
is
because
there
simply
have
been
no
instances
where
the
revenue
department
has
tried
to
assert
that
penalty
in
situations
where
it
was
arguable
that
the
taxpayer
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
his
argument.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
your
honor,
the
particular
penalty
would
have
to
be
assessed
by
the
revenue
department,
and
the
issuance
of
the
assessment
triggers
the
right
to
go
into
court.
that's
how
you'd
get
a
judicial
determination
of
that.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
i'm
not
aware
of
any
instance,
your
honor,
where
the
revenue
department
has,
in
fact,
attempted
to
impose
this
penalty
on
someone
who
has
contested
their
liability.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
there
are
two
criminal
statutes
to
which
the
petitioner
in
this
case
refers.
one
of
the
two
statutes
was
held
unconstitutional
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
prior
to
the
time
when
the
return
for
the
first
tax
period
that's
at
issue
in
this
case
would
have
been
due.
the
second
statute
has
a
willfulness
requirement
in
it,
and
it's...
we
submit
that
a
taxpayer
who
has
pursued
a
reasonable
argument
pursuant
to
an
accepted
predeprivation
procedure
in
georgia
has
not
acted
wilfully
within
the
meaning
of
those
criminal
statutes.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
no,
your
honor.
the
particular...
of
the
two
criminal
statutes
in
question,
the
one
that
is
still
valid
in
georgia
is
pattered
after
a
similar
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
we
cannot
assert,
your
honor,
that
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
to
have
read
the
refund
statute
in
that
way.
we
do
assert,
however,
that
in
the
absence
of
any
prior
construction
of
that
statute
by
the
georgia
supreme
court,
in
the
absence
of
any
reported
decisions
that
we're
aware
of
where
refunds
of
unconstitutional
taxes
have
in
fact
been
provided
under
that
statute,
that
the
taxpayers...
taxpayers
assume
the
risk
that
the
ultimate
interpretation
may
turn
out
to
be
other
than
they
believe,
and
we
believe
that...
we
submit
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
it's
last
opinion
in
this
case,
your
honor?
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
the
georgia
supreme
court
concluded
that
one
of
the
predeprivation
remedies
that
could
have
been
brought
by
these
taxpayers
was
an
action
for
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief
prior
to
the
time
when
the
taxes
were
due.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
your
honor,
one
thing
we
would
like
to
note
is,
until
the
filing
of
the
brief
in
this
court,
the
petitioner
had
never
mentioned
that
particular
code
section,
had
never
pointed
it
out
to
the
parties
or
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
as
representing
a
bar
to
that
particular
type
of
action.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
oh,
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
correct.
this--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--that
particular
code
section,
again,
it's
a
statute
that
has
never
been
applied
or
interpreted.
however,
we
think,
based
on
the
georgia
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
48-3-26,
which
provides
generally
that
there
can
be
no
judicial
interference
with
the
collection
or
levy
of
taxes
in
general,
that
that...
that
48-7-84
would
be
interpreted
as
no
bar
to
an
action
for
injunction
where
the
tax
was
alleged
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
question
in
this
case,
we
take...
we
initially
take...
we
dispute
the
taxpayer's
statement
of
the
standard
of
clarity
that
a
predeprivation
remedy
has
to
provide
before
it
can
satisfy
a
state's
due
process
obligations.
what
the
court
has
indicated
in
mckesson
and
harper
is
that
a
state
must
provide
a
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
your
liabilities,
and
a
clear
and
certain
remedy
in
the
event
that
you
prevail.
in
the
mckesson
case,
for
example,
the
state
of
florida
attempted
to
argue
that
mckesson
could
be
put
back
in
a
hypothetical
position
of
parity
visavis
other
distributors.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
we
say
it's
a
predeprivation
procedure
that
the--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--i
submit
that
it
was,
your
honor,
for
several
reasons.
the
georgia
supreme
court's
decision
regarding
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
was
based
on
numerous
prior
georgia
decisions
that
had
talked
about
the
availability
of
that
type
of
relief
where
you
were
talking
about
unconstitutional
taxes.
there
had
also
been
other
cases
involving
income
taxes
where
those
types
of
actions
had
been
entertained
by
the
georgia
courts
notwithstanding
48-7-84...
for
example,
the
case
of
parrish
v.
employees'
retirement
system,
which
was
an
action
brought
by
state
retirees
immediately
after
the
davis
case,
when
the
georgia
supreme
court,
when
the
georgia
legislature
had
amended
its
statutes
to
provide
for
equal
treatment
of
federal
and
state
retirement
benefits.
state
retirees
filed
an
action
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
georgia,
contesting
the
constitutionality
of
georgia's
new
income
tax
statutes,
and
the
georgia
courts
entertained
that
case
and
decided
it
on
its
merits.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
in
the
salter
case,
your
honor,
that
was
an
action
that
was
filed,
eventually
went
to
fulton
county
superior
court.
that
was
an
action
that
was
filed
subsequent
to
the
davis
decision,
and
after
this
taxpayer
had
already
paid
the
taxes
that
he
now
wants
returned.
what
happened
in
that
case
is,
after
the
georgia
general
assembly
amended
the
income
tax
statutes
and
provided
for
equal
treatment
for
federal,
state,
and
private
pensions,
the
trial
court
in
that
case
dismissed
the
action.
we
submit
it
was
moot.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
your
honor,
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
found
that
the
income
tax
refund
statute
does
not
apply
to
taxes
paid
under
a
statute
later
found
unconstitutional.
we
submit
that
what...
that
these
taxpayers
should
have
pursued
the
predeprivation
remedies
which
were
available
to
them
under
georgia
law.
if
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
talk
specifically
about
those
aspects
of
the
georgia
tax
system
which
this
petitioner
contends
subjected
it
to
constitutionally
significant
duress.
now,
it's
important
to
note
that
the
petitioner
is
arguing
only
that
he
was
subject
to
implied
duress.
it's
undisputed
that
in
this
case
he
was
never
so
much
as
threatened
with
a
levy,
attachment,
any
criminal
prosecution,
garnishment,
or
any
other
sanctions
if
he
did
not
pay
the
taxes
that
he
now
seeks
to
have
refunded.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
he
received
an
assessment
notice
with
respect
to
the
1988
taxes--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--which
he
showed
as
due
on
his
return
as
filed,
and
which
he
did
not
pay.
he
got
a
computergenerated
assessment
notice
which
basically
said,
you've
reported
this
as
due
on
your
return,
therefore
we're
assessing
it,
and
here's
the
interest
and
penalty.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
the
computer
essentially
spit
it
out
that
way.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
as
far
as
the
taxes
that
he
wants
returned
in
this
case--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--it's...
certainly
we
hope
so,
your
honor,
and
the
point
the
court
is
making
is
this.
the
computer,
if
you
will,
made
the
initial
determination
that
if
one
has
reported
a
liability
as
due
on
your
return,
and
you
do
not
pay
it,
that
that
penalty
is
appropriate.
if
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
had
filed
his
return,
and
removed
from
the
tax
base
the
federal
retirement
benefits,
the
revenue
department
would
have
been
obligated
to
issue
an
assessment
to
him
which
would
have
triggered
the
right
to
go
into
court.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
your
honor,
if
a
taxpayer
has
made
full
disclosure
on
his
return
that
he's
taking
an
item
out
based
on
a
constitutional
objection,
i
don't
see
how
he
can
be
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
but
he...
but
he's
not
been
criminally
prosecuted,
your
honor.
now,
he's
asserted
in
this
case--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--oh,
no.
no,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
if...
clearly
when
one
reports...
reflects
on
your
return
the
constitutional
objection
that
you're
making,
that...
i
submit
that
whether
that
objection
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
that
you
have
not
acted
wilfully
within
the
meaning
of
the
criminal
statutes.
that's
what
i--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--your
honor,
this
court
dealt
with
that
question
in
cheek
v.
united
states,
and
my
reading
of
cheek
is
that
the
taxpayer
in
that
case,
because
of
his
constitutional
objections,
which
were
constitutional
objections
that
had
been
repeatedly
rejected
by
the
courts,
simply
withdrew
himself
from
the
tax
system.
he
filed
excess
withholding
allowances
so
that
he
had
no
withholding
on
his
wages,
and
he
simply
didn't
file
returns,
and
the
court
found
in
that
case
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
have
a
jury
instruction
that
a
sincerely
held
constitutional
belief
that
wages
were
not
income
could
subject
him
from
criminal
penalties
under
the
internal
revenue
code
under
those
circumstances.
but
at
the
same
time,
the
court's
opinion
suggested
that
if
he
had
filed
his
return,
made
full
disclosure
on
his
return,
and
utilized
the
predeprivation
procedures
before
the
united
states
tax
court,
that
that
would
have
been
a
much
different
story.
and
that's
what
we're
suggesting
here,
that
this
taxpayer
had
predeprivation
remedies
available.
if
he
makes
full
disclosure
on
his
return
and
pursues
one
of
those
procedures,
he's
not...
he's
not
properly
subject
to
prosecution
in
georgia.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
your
honor,
there...
i
submit
that
there...
every
day
lawyers
make
their
best
decisions
concerning
the
interpretation
of
procedures
and
the
substantive
law,
and
many
times
they
turn
out
to
be
wrong.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
your
honor,
i
believe...
i
believe
what
the
georgia
supreme
court...
the
way
the
court
arrived
at
its
construction
is
this.
there
had
been
no
prior
georgia
cases
interpreting
the
refund
statute.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
certainly,
your
honor.
[laughter]
but
there
were
no
reported
instances
in
which
taxes
of
unconstitutional...
unconstitutional
taxes
had
in
fact
been
repaid
under
that
statute.
at
the
same
time--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
at
the
same
time,
your
honor,
there
were--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
your
honor,
at
the
same
time,
there
were
many
decisions,
prior
decisions
of
the
georgia
appellate
courts
which
had
recognized
that
a
refund
statute
is
in
the
nature
of
an
action
for
money
had
and
received,
and
that
the
plaintiff
coming
in
under
a
refund
statute
bore
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
defendant
held
money
which
he
was
not
in
equity
and
good
conscience
entitled
to
hold.
there
were
also...
and
we've
cited
these
cases
in
our
brief
in
opposition
to
cert
in
this
case.
there
are
also
many
cases
where
the
georgia
courts
have
found
that
where
statutes
were
invalidated,
retroactive
relief
need
not
necessarily
be
provided
if,
because
of
the
reliance
interests
of
the
parties
and
other
similar
considerations,
unjust
results
would
follow.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
what
the
georgia
supreme
court
was
doing
in
its
interpretation
of
the
refund
statute
was
drawing
upon
these
prior
principles
of
georgia
law
and
extending
them
in
construing
the
statute.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
court's
concern,
though,
has
already
been
addressed
and
disposed
of
in
the
brinkerhoff
case.
that
case
recognizes,
and
other
cases
recognize
generally,
that...
that
a
court's
construction
of
its
own
laws,
even
if
it's
an
unexpected
construction,
does
not
necessarily
give
rise
to
a
due
process
problem.
in
that
particular
case,
in
brinkerhoff,
the
court
found
that
there
was
a
due
process
problem.
the
taxpayer
in
brinkerhoff
had
pursued
the
only
tax
procedure
which
was
then
available
to
him
under
settled
missouri
law.
he...
the
trial
court
found
against
him.
he
took
it
on
appeal
to
the
missouri
supreme
court.
the
missouri
supreme
court
reversed
its
prior
decisions
and
announced...
and
found
a
newly
announced
but
timebarred
procedure
which
it
said
the
taxpayer
should
have
used,
and
this
court
said
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
taxpayer
was
effectively
left
without
any
remedy
at
law.
he
didn't
have...
the
court
had
found
that
the
one
he
chose
was
not
available,
and
by
the
time
they
found
that
out,
the
one
they
said
he
could
have
used
was
not
available.
but
the
court
said
that
absent...
in
the
absence
of
a
prior
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
state's
highest
court,
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
assume
the
risk
that
the
ultimate
interpretation
of
the
statute
might
differ
from
his
own.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
georgia
supreme
court's
reading
of
the
refund
statute
is
that
extreme.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
your
honor,
i
believe...
i
believe
that
is
the...
that
is
the
holding
of
the
court
in
the
brinkerhoff
case.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
again,
i
submit
that
that's
not...
that
does
not
comport
with
the
facts
in
this
case,
but
i
believe
brinkerhoff
settles
that
if
a...
that
state
courts
interpret
their
state
procedures
and
their
substantive
law,
and
except
in
extraordinary
circumstances
which
we
believe
are
not
present
in
this
case--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--i'm
not
sure
which
question--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--i
believe
that's
what
brinkerhoff
stands
for.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
what
i...
what
i
intended
to
say,
your
honor,
is
that
the
court
in
brinkerhoff
indicated
that
except
in
extraordinary
circumstances
an
interpretation
by
a
state
court
of
particular
procedures
available
to
taxpayers
is
not
going
to
give
rise
to
due
process
problems.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
i
think
there
is
also
one
other
factor,
your
honor,
in
brinkerhoff,
which
i
believe
compelled
the
result
in
that
case,
and
that
is,
by
virtue
of
the
timing
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
decisions,
this
taxpayer
was
effectively
left
with
never
having
had
an
opportunity
to
contest
his
liability,
and
in
this
particular
case
there
were
predeprivation
procedures
available
to
the
petitioner
which
he
chose
not
to
use.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
that
was
his
reading
of
the
refund
statute--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--and
brinkerhoff--
[laughter]
and
your
honor,
and
brinkerhoff
stands
for
the
proposition
that
in
the
absence
of
a
prior
controlling
decision
by
that
statute,
that's
the
risk
that
all
litigants
run.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
first
question
concerned
the
henderson
and
the
wright
v.
forrester
cases,
and
also
the
legislative
history,
or
the
statement
of
the
governors
that
is
quoted
in
the
wright
case.
what
is
clear,
your
honor,
is
that
notwithstanding
what
the
governor
had
hoped
to
achieve
by
way
of
enacting
the
refund
statute,
the
language
that
was...
what
the
general
assembly
did
in
enacting
the
refund
statute
did
not
have
fully
that
effect.
he
had
certain
specific
taxes
in
mind,
and
in
a
subsequent
case...
i
believe
it
was
eibel
v.
forrester...
the
georgia
supreme
court
said
that
the
legislature
had
not
made
the
statute
retroactive
to
the
tax
periods
in
question,
so
the
particular
taxpayers
he
had
hoped
to
benefit
were
not
benefited.
we
submit
that
there's
nothing,
other
than
the
mere
statement
from
the
governor
that's
cited
in
that
case,
to
suggest
that
the
language
that
the
general
assembly
actually
used
was
intended
to
have
scope
broad
enough
to
encompass
unconstitutional
taxes.
the
court's
second
question--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--if
you
could
repeat
it,
please.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
i
think,
your
honor,
the
argument
that
the
tax...
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
made
is
that
if
we
lose
on
the
adequacy
of
our
predeprivation
procedures,
that
we
are
obligated
to
refund
these
amounts,
and
that
all
other
taxpayers,
regardless
of
any
statute
of
limitations,
are
open.
now,
the
georgia...
the
basic
georgia
tax
scheme
was
in
effect
since
the
1940's.
assumedly
under
that
argument
someone
would
try
to
assert
refunds
back
to
the
1940's,
assuming
they're
still
here
to
make
those
claims.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
it
is
in
this
case,
your
honor,
but
there
are
other
cases
pending
in
georgia
where
that
limitation
is
not
being
applied,
where
the
petitioners
are
seeking
to
collect
taxes
back
beyond
3
years.
but
i
think
the
question,
your
honor,
concerning
sovereign
immunity,
we've
asserted
that
even
if...
even
if
georgia's
predeprivation
remedies
are
found
to
be
constitutionally
insufficient,
that
that
raises
the
question
regarding
whether
a
state
can
be
sued
in
its
own
courts
for
monetary...
retroactive
monetary
relief
notwithstanding
sovereign
immunity,
and
i
submit
that
that's
a
question
that
is
very
much
left
open
by
the
mckesson
case.
in
mckesson,
the
taxpayer
had
filed
an
action
under
florida's
repayment
of
funds
statute,
and
the
court
was
careful
to
note
in
its
opinion
that,
under
the
particular
facts
of
that
case,
there
was
a
federal
due
process
obligation
for
the
payment
of
relief,
or
backwardlooking
relief
pursuant
to
that
particular
state's
post
deprivation
procedure.
so
the
court
was
very
careful
to
note
that
there
was
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
court
has
indicated
in
numerous
cases
that
absent
a
waiver
of
its
sovereign
immunity
the
states
generally
can't
be
sued
in
any
court
by
any
person
on
any
cause
of
action,
and
we
submit
that
that--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
what...
if
i
understand
the
question,
or
what
the
concern
is,
is
that
you
could
have
a
constitutional
violation
with
no
effective
remedy.
we
submit
that
the
various
immunities
and
similar
doctrines
that
have
been
recognized
by
this
court
generally
demonstrate
that
there
can
be
many
circumstances
where,
because
of
qualified
immunity,
or
absolute
immunity,
or
the
bar
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
that
retroactive
monetary
relief
may
be
unavailable,
and
we
submit
that
this
is
just
such
a
situation.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
reading
of
those
cases,
your
honor,
sovereign
immunity
did
not
come
up
as
a
direct
issue,
and
again,
i
believe
that
the
court
has
indicated
in
the
mckesson
case,
in
my
reading
of
the
oral
arguments
in
that
case,
a
concern
that
sovereign
immunity
is
very
much
an
issue
in
the
context
of
a
situation
like
this.
thank
you.
