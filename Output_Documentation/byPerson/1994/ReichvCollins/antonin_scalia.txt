justice
antonin
scalia
--instead
of
doing
that,
and
that
would
be
okay.
he
has
the
option
of
either
paying
under
protest,
or
posting
a
bond.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
okay,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
we
have
to
hold
that
georgia
changed
its
law?
i
mean,
i'm
willing
to
accept
what
the
georgia
supreme
court
said.
if
georgia
supreme
court
says
that
was
always
georgia
law,
it
was
always
georgia
law.
but
your
argument
would
remain,
well,
if
it
was
georgia
law,
it
certainly
didn't
seem
to
be
georgia
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
but
isn't
that
the
only
point
you
have
to
make?
you
don't
really
have
to
argue
that
georgia
changed
its
law.
you
only
have
to
argue
that
georgia
should
have
made
its
law
clear
so
that
a
taxpayer
would
know
how
to
get
a
refund
and
not
be
snookered
by
thinking
he
could
proceed
one
way
and
then
be
told
after
the
fact
that
he
couldn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
a
pretty
pyrrhic
victory,
then,
for...
maybe
not
for
your
clients,
but
certainly
for
future
taxpayers
who
are
treated
similarly.
you're
saying
that
all
the
state
has
to
do
is
enact
a
statute
closing
its
doors
to
claims
for
retroactive
tax
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
that.
they
can't
come
into
federal
court,
and
so
long
as
the
state
closes
the
state
court,
where
do
you
expect
them
to
sue,
in
another
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
really
mean
foolishly
believed.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
mean
reasonably
believed.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
has
it
been
determined
that
a
misperception
of
the
law
is
ever
reasonable
cause?
i
mean,
if
i
read
that
phrase,
i
would
think
reasonable
cause
means,
you
know,
i
had
an
emergency.
i
had
to
save
my
child's
life,
or
something.
you're
saying
it's
reasonable
cause
if
the
taxpayer
is
wrong
about
the
law?
reasonably
wrong
about
it,
but
wrong
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
georgia
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
believe
it,
or
there
are
cases
to
that
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
calvert,
can
i
ask
you
about
the
refund
statute
which
you
say
he
should
have
known,
or
at
least
shouldn't
have
been
sure
provided
for
refund?
it's
appendix
g
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says,
"a
taxpayer
shall
be
refunded
any
and
all
taxes
or
fees
which
are
determined
to
have
been
erroneously
or
illegally
assessed
and
collected
from
him
under
the
laws
of
this
state,
whether
paid
voluntarily
or
involuntarily.
"
these
taxpayers
thought
that
that
would
enable
them
to
obtain
a
refund
of
taxes
that
were
determined
to
have
been
illegally
assessed
and
collected
under
the
laws
of
georgia.
two
federal
courts
had
held
that
that's
what
the
statute
meant,
and
that
therefore
the
federal
tax
injunction
act
applied,
since
there
was
an
adequate
state
remedy
under
this
provision
and...
among
others,
and
yet
you
tell
me
that
it
was
reasonable
to
expect
him
to
know
that
this
would
not
apply
to
that
one
category
of
illegal
taxes
that
consist
of
taxes
unconstitutional
under
the
federal
constitution.
i
mean,
if
the
georgia
supreme
court
wants
to
make
that
up
and
read
the
statute
that
way,
that's
fine,
that's
state
law.
but
you
tell
me
that
a
lawyer
reading
that
should
have
known
that
he
couldn't
get
a
refund?
justice
antonin
scalia
illegally
assessed
and
collected
from
him
under
the
laws
of
this
state,
whether
paid
voluntarily
or
involuntary.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
was
a
lot
of
money
owing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
word
illegally
does
not
cover
unconstitutionally.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
should
get
less
of
a
remedy
for
an
unconstitutionally
assessed
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
took
care
of
that
in
our
federal
constitutional
decisions,
i
had
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
is
not
a
snare
and
a
delusion
to
any
taxpayer
who
had
a
valid
claim,
i
don't
know
what
would
be.
this
in
effect
announces,
don't
worry,
you
don't
have
to
protest
in
advance,
we
have
a
refund
statute
that
says
you
can
be
refunded
all
taxes
that
are
illegally
assessed
and
collected.
i
could
not
imagine
a
more
deceptively
phrased
statute
if
one
had
set
out
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
risk
at
all.
a
statute
can
mean
anything
in
the
world,
and
there's
no
due
process
claim.
a
statute
says
black,
and
the
supreme
court
of
a
state
interprets
it
as
white,
and
that's
no
due
process
problem.
it
reads
out
the
word,
not.
it
reads
it
as
saying
yes,
when
it
reads
no.
no
due
process
problem
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
is,
and
is
the
argument
that
you're
making
that
no
matter
how
contrary
to
the
words
of
a
statute
a
supreme
court's
interpretation
is,
there
is
no
due
process
problem
so
long
as
it's
the
first
time
the
court
has
ever
interpreted
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
answer's
no.
you
say
there
are
circumstances
where
that
will
not
comport
with
due
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
asked
whether
it
is
always
the
case
that
so
long
as
it's
the
first
time
a
supreme
court
of
a
state
is
interpreting
a
statute,
it
can
interpret
it
to
mean
whatever
it
wants
so
long
as
it's
the
first
time
it's
ever
interpreted
it.
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
but
now,
most
recently
you've
said,
except
in
extraordinary
circumstances.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
what
it
meant
by
extraordinary
circumstances
was
an
interpretation
that
is
so
flatly
contrary
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
i
consider
that
a
pretty
extraordinary
circumstance
to
read
this
language
to
mean
that
you
can't
get
a
refund.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
chose
not
to
use
them
because
this
statute
announced
to
him
that
he
didn't
have
to
use
them,
that
he
could
always
get
a
refund
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah...
and
he
shouldn't
have
read
it
the
way
it
was
written.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
henson,
these
people
are
all
retirees,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
this
drags
on,
many
of
them
are
never
going
to
see
what
they're
entitled
to,
i
suppose.
