i
have
just
one
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
your
argument
equally
strong
if
the
basis
of
invalidity
is
addressed
entirely
on
the
statute,
rather
than
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
davis,
the
court
construed
section
111,
and
arguably
it
may
or
may
not
have
decided
a
constitutional
question.
does
it
make
any
difference
to
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
serious
about
that?
supposing...
you
know,
there
are
a
lot
of
tax
protesters
out
there
who
think
all
income
taxes
are
unconstitutional,
and
they
would
never
be
subject
to
this
penalty,
you
say,
if
they
put
an
appropriate
recital
in
about
how
bad
taxes
are,
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
be
left
of
the
essential
holding
of
mckesson,
then,
that
the
state
must
provide
an
adequate
remedy,
if
we
can
say,
well,
we'll
elect
to
rely
on
our
sovereign
immunity?
wouldn't
the
whole
point
of
the
whole
doctrine
be
gone?
