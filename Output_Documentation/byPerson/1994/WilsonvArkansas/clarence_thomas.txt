justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
and
it
involves
a
rather
simple
issue
but
important
issue,
and
that
is,
what
is
a
constitutional
requirement
on
police
officers
if
they
have
a
valid
warrant
appeared
in
the
door,
can
they
enter
without
knocking
and
announcing,
is
there
a
constitutional
requirement
to
do
so?
the
petitioner
here
was
convicted
on
state
law
drug
charges
after
the
arkansas
and
trial
court
denied
her
motion
to
suppress
evidence,
seized
during
a
search
of
her
residence,
which
i
might
add
a
valid
warrant.
petitioner
argued
that
the
search
of
her
home
was
invalid
because
the
police
had
violated
the
common
law
principle
requiring
them
to
announce
their
presence
and
authority
before
entering.
the
state
supreme
court
affirmed
rejecting
petitioner's
argument
that
the
common
law
not
going
to
announce
principle
as
required
by
the
fourth
amendment.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reverse.
in
evaluating
the
scope
of
the
constitutional
right
to
be
securing
one's
house,
we
have
looked
to
the
traditional
protections
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
afforded
by
the
common
law
at
the
time
of
the
framing.
given
the
long
standing
common
law
endorsement
of
the
practice
of
announcement,
and
the
wealth
of
founding-era
statutes
and
cases
adopting
the
knock
and
announce
principle.
we
hold
that
the
method
of
an
officer's
entry
into
a
dwelling
is
among
the
factors
to
be
considered
in
assessing
the
reasonableness
of
a
search
or
seizure.
the
common
law
principle
was
never
stated
as
an
inflexible
rule
requiring
announcement
under
all
circumstances.
thus,
the
fourth
amendment
requirement
of
reasonableness
should
not
be
read
to
mandate
a
rigid
rule
of
announcement
that
ignores
countervailing
law
enforcement
interest.
in
this
case,
we
need
not
attempt
a
comprehensive
catalogue
of
the
relevant
countervailing
factors.
for
now,
we
leave
to
the
lower
courts
the
task
of
determining
the
circumstances
under
which
an
unannounced
entry
is
reasonable.
respondent
here
has
offered
two
reasons
why
the
unannounced
entry
in
this
case
may
have
been
justified,
because
the
state
supreme
court
did
not
address
the
sufficiency
of
these
justifications
however,
we
remand
to
allow
the
state
courts
to
make
the
determination
of
reasonableness
in
the
first
instance.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
