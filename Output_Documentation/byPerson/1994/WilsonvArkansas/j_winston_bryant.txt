mr.
j.
winston
bryant
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
in
this
particular
case,
it's
very
important
that
the
officers
had
a
search
warrant
before
they
went
on
the
premises,
and
that
takes
care
of
most
of
the
probable
cause
requirements
that
mr.
hall
has
been
talking
about.
arkansas
is
asking
this
court
to
categorically
balance
the
interests
in
the
execution
of
a
warrant.
this
court
has
categorically
approved
officers...
approved
police
practices
designed
to
protect
police
officers
from
violence.
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
require
knock
and
announce.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
your
honor.
it
is--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--yes.
the
execution
of
the
warrant
is
subject
to
the
reasonableness
clause.
the
state's
primary
or
first
position
is
that
knock
and
announce
is
not
required
categorically.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
no,
your
honor,
in
that
instance
the
case
is...
the
state's
first
argument
is
that
it
is
not
relevant
in
the
consideration.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
no,
your
honor.
the
use--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--in
the
case
of
a
battering
ram,
your
honor,
that
would
be
subject
to
the
reasonableness
clause.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
it
might
be
necessary
in
some
instances,
your
honor,
where
that
was
the
means
by
which
the
officers
had
to
enter.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
would
be--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--yes.
yes.
the
state
is
asking
this
court
to
balance
the
interests--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--it
could,
your
honor.
it
could
under
the
state's
first
theory.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
the--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
that's
possible.
however,
under
the
fourth
amendment
this
court--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--the...
yes,
your...
well,
let
me
answer
it
this
way,
your
honor.
knock
and
announce
in
our
position
should
not
be
a
part
of
that
inquiry.
if
there
is--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--no,
your
honor.
that--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--under
the...
yes,
under
the
reasonable
clause.
under
that
test,
your
honor,
the
state...
the
state
is
saying...
the
state's
case
is
this.
the
fourth
amendment
requires
under
the
reasonableness
clause
of
balancing
of
the
interests
when
you
balance
the
interests
of
the
state
against
the
interest
of
the
occupant,
because
this
court
has
recognized
that
when
the
officers
are
in
the
process
of
executing
a
warrant,
they
put
themselves
at
great
risk.
police
safety
is
a
legitimate
and
weighty
state
interest
to
be
considered,
and
when
you
categorically
balance
those
interests,
the
interest
weighs
heavily
in
favor
of
the
state,
and
this
court
has
previously
adopted
such
rules.
for
example,
in
pennsylvania
v.
mimms,
this
court
said
that
when
the
police
stop
an
automobile
the
police
can
require
the
occupant
to
get
out
of
the
car.
in
that
particular
instance,
the
court
balanced
the
interest
of
the
state
against
the
interest
of
the
occupant,
and
utilized
police
safety
as
a
basis
for
that
rule.
this
court
did
the
same
thing
in
michigan...
in
the
michigan
v.
summers
case.
in
that
particular
case,
there
was
a
search
warrant.
the
officers
went
into
the
house.
this
court
said
that
the
officers
could
detain
the
occupants
of
the
house
for
the
duration
of
the
search.
in
that
case
also
there
was
a
balancing
of
the
interests.
the
court
concluded
that
officer
safety
was
a
legitimate
state
interest
and
that
that
rule
protected
officer
safety.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
your
honor,
in
arkansas
the
supreme
court
has
adopted
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
and
the
supreme
court
has
taken
the
position
that
their
rules
supersede
those
of
the
legislature.
if
there's
anything
the
legislature
passes
regarding
a
rule,
regarding
criminal
rules
of
procedure,
the
court's
rule
is
the
final
authority.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
the
court's
rule
on
arrest
warrants
does
not
require
knock
and
announce.
it's
the
same
as--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--search
warrants.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
there
is
a
rule
on
arrest
warrants,
your
honor.
that's
the
rule--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--it's
the
criminal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
number
4,
your
honor,
that's
been
promulgated
by
the
arkansas
court.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
the
officer
in
making
arrests
does
not
have
to
knock
and
announce.
there's
no
requirement
in
that
rule
for
knock
and
announce,
if
the--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--the
state
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
based
on
arkansas
supreme
court
practice
their
rules
would
take
precedence
over
a
legislative
statute.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes,
your
honor.
the
state--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--we
do
dispute
that.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
your
honor,
the
state
has
cited
two
cases
in
the
brief.
one
is
lonius,
the
lonius
case,
and
the
other
one
is
a
case
i
can't
recall
the
name
of,
but
in
those
cases,
your
honor,
although
there
was
no
holding
that
search
warrants
extended
to...
did
not
extend
to
felony
cases,
there
was...
the
judges
in
both
cases,
certain
judges
in
both
cases
did
not...
stated
they
did
not
want
to
extend
the
rule
in
felony
cases.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
your
honor,
that
is
located...
one
case,
your
honor,
is
1802,
and
the
other
case
is
1819,
and
that--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--page
22
of
the
brief,
lonnick
v.
brown
and
ratcliffe
v.
burton
are
the
two
cases.
but
in
addition...
but
in
addition
to
that,
your
honor,
modern
day
commentators
have
taken
the
position
that
it's
not
definite
that
knock
and
announce
was
required
at
common
law,
and
in
fact
the
modern
day
search
warrant
was
not
in
existence
in
early
common
law,
so
the
state's
position
is
that
common
law
does
not
require
knock
and
announce
in
felony
cases.
however,
even
assuming
that
is
true,
that
the
common
law
is
controlling--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--this
court
should
not
follow
the
common
law
knock-and-announce
rule.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
your
honor--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--that
is
correct--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--and
for
the
government,
that
is
correct,
but
the
point
the
state
is
making
in
that
is
that
the
authority
is
not
conclusive
or
well-settled
that
that
was
the
rule
at
common
law,
but
even
assuming
that
it
was,
this
court
should
not
follow
a
common
law
rule
that
incorporates
certain
police
practices
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted
or
before
into
a
black
letter
constitutional
rule
at
this
time.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
your
honor,
that
would
be
reasonable,
and
that's
the
state's
position.
the
officers
in
the
field
should
be
able
to
make
a
decision,
and
arkansas
is
not
asking
this
court
to
prohibit
knock
and
announce.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
your
honor,
in
this
case
the
officers
had
a
search
warrant,
and
there
was
a
probable
cause
requirement
met
that
there
was
illegal
contraband
on
premises
plus
there
was
a
weapon
on
premises,
and
in
situations
where
the
officers
serve
a
warrant,
they
are
at
great
risk,
and
the
rule
that
arkansas
is
suggesting
would
provide
for
the
protection
of
officers,
the
protection
of
occupants
by
standards
if
present,
as
well
as
legitimate
law
enforcement
principles
of
preventing
the
escape
of
suspects,
preventing
the
destruction
of
evidence,
and
this
court
has
said
that
a
categorical
rule
is
best
developed
which
will
give
the
officers
firm
guidance
in
the
field.
they
are
not
placed
in
the
position
of
deciding
whether
i
should
knock
or
announce,
or
what
exception
applies,
and
the
state
submits
that
that
is
the
reasonable
approach
in
this
case.
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
require
knock
and
announce,
and
the
petitioner
would
have
this
court
elevate
knock
and
announce
as
an
absolute,
rigid
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
arkansas
does
not
believe
that
that
is
proper,
and
it's
not
required
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
yes--
mr.
j.
winston
bryant
--that
is
essentially
the
u.s.
government's
position,
and
that
is
the
state's
fall
back
position,
that
if
this
court
does
not
see
fit
to
announce
a
categorical
rule
to
protect
the
police
officers
in
this
instance,
that
a
reasonable
fall
back
would
be
the
position
by
the
solicitor,
in
that
knock
and
announce
would
be
part
of
the
reasonableness
test
under
the
fourth
amendment.
