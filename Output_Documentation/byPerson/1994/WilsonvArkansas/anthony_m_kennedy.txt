justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
position
is
exactly
the
same
if
your
client
were
the
only
person
in
the
house,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what's
your
position
on
the
question?
is
the
destruction
of
evidence,
or
the
potential
thereof,
an
exception
to
the
inevitable
discovery
rule
were
we
to
adopt
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
suppose
the
police
don't
have
any
knowledge
that
there
was
a
gun
in
the
possession
of
a
drug
dealer
but
he
is
a
drug
dealer,
is
it
unreasonable
for
the
police
to
assume
that
he
probably
has
a
gun?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
what
the
police
officers
can
assume
when
they
begin
to
make
their
arrest.
is
it
unreasonable
for
them
to
assume
that
the
dealer
might
have
a
gun?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
unreasonable
for
the
police
to
assume
that
in
the
case
of
easily
disposable
contraband
that
there
is
a
strong
probability,
or
a
significant
probability,
that
the
contraband
will
be...
that
there
will
be
an
attempt
to
dispose
of
it
by
flushing
it
down
the
drain?
is
that
an
unreasonable
assumption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
aware
of
no
authority
that
requires
the
police
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
there
are
some
other
crimes
for
which
they
might
have
evidence
that
would
excuse
them
ignoring
an
ongoing
crime.
well,
and
this
was
a
search
warrant,
not
an
arrest
warrant.
i
mean,
that
is
a
most
improbable
basis
to
ask
us
to
base
an
opinion
of
this
court
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
under
your
view
the
state
routinely
could
use
a
battering
ram
to
knock
down
every
door.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
the
way
entry
is
affected
is
a
component
of
reasonableness.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
about
kicking?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
about
using
a
skeleton
key?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
of
this
is
without
knocking,
obviously.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
of
these
hypotheticals
i've
given
to
you
constitute
reasonable
entry
in
all
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
what
we're
testing,
is
the
state's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--first
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
the
answer
to
each
of
my
questions
under
your
first
theory
is
that
there
is
no
illegality
in
the
entry.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i'd
like...
we
have
to
write
the
opinion.
i
want
to
know
what
the
consequences
of
my
opinion
are,
and
i'm
asking
you
whether
or
not
the
manner
of
entry
is
ever
relevant
as
to
reasonableness,
the
same
question
justice
souter's
question
asked.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
to
know
if
it's
an
element
in
considering
the
reasonableness
of
the
search.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
dreeben,
i
have
the
same
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
at
the
outset
of
the
argument.
is
there
any
significant
difference
between
saying
that
there
is
a
knock-and-announce
rule
with
exigent
circumstances
or
exceptions
on
the
one
hand,
or
the
rule
as
you
just
phrased
it,
that
there
is
a
reasonableness
requirement
and
that
knocking
is
a
component
of
that.
is
there
any
significant
difference
for
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
as
i
understood
your
brief
in
the
case
of
drug
dealers,
there
is
a
presumption
that
they
have
an
arm
and
a
weapon,
and
that
they
may
dispose
of
the
contraband.
do
i
misinterpret
your
brief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
my
colloquy
with
the
defense
counsel
you
said,
well,
this
is
a
low
level
drug
dealer.
can
you
give
me
any
assistance
with
that?
anybody
that
sold
drugs
is
a
drug
dealer
for
this
purpose?
