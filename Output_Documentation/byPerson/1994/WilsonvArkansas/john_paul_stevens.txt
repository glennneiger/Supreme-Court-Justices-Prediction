does
arkansas
have
an
inevitable
discovery
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
why
did
they
adopt
it
reluctantly?
who
made
them
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
findings
that
support
that
conclusion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
should
make
the
findings
de
novo
ourselves?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
would
at
least
have
to
read
the
record
in
full,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
broader
question
based
on
that
statement?
is
it
the
government's
position
that
the
fourth
amendment
rule
for
which
you
advocate
would
be
precisely
the
same
as
this
court's
construction
of
section
3109
insofar
as
we've
decided
3109
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
apart
from
the
question
of
remedy,
in
terms
of
the
scope
of
whether
there's
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
would
you
say
the
law
would
be
the
same
as
whether
there's
a
violation
of
3109?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
in
a
different
way,
then.
if
we
have
a...
two
cases
of
identical
facts,
one
under
3109
in
the
federal
case,
and
another
state
case
like
this,
do
you
think
we
would
apply
the
same
rules
to
determine
whether
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated
in
the
one
case
and
3109
was
violated
in
another?
is
there
a
difference
in
the
approach?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
the
fourth
amendment.
