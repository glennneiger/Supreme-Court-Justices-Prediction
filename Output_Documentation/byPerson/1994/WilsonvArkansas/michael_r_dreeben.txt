mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
the
manner
of
entry
in
executing
a
search
warrant
is
a
component
of
the
reasonableness
analysis
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
knock
and
announce
is
a
component
of
that
analysis.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
that's
largely
a
semantic
difference,
but
there
is
a
connotation
when
one
uses
the
word,
exigent
circumstances,
that
the
police
may
have
to
have
a
particularly
compelling
immediate
justification
for
dispensing
with
the
requirement
in
question.
that
is
not
the
way
we
analyze
this
problem.
we
analyze
this
problem
as
involving
a
balance
of
what
is
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
for
the
police
to
do
in
executing
a
search
warrant,
and
that
there
should
not
be
a
strict
requirement
of
exigent
circumstances
to
justify
the
police
in
making
an
immediate
entry.
the
primary--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
we
think
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed
on
the
grounds
that
the
record
clearly
indicates
that
the
police
had
reasonable
justification
for
believing
that
there
were
two
grounds
for
making
an
immediate
entry.
first,
the
avoidance
of
the
potential
of
violence,
because
they
had
knowledge
that
petitioner
had
a
firearm
in
her
house,
and
that
she--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
there's
any
serious
dispute
on
that.
i
think
petitioner's
counsel
today
indicated
there's
no
real
serious
dispute
about
what
happened
and
what
knowledge
there
was.
the
record
is
fairly
complete.
there
is
a
search
warrant
affidavit--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
you'd
have
to
read
the
record
of
the
suppression
hearing.
it's
not
my
understanding
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
suppression
motion
was
renewed
at
trial,
and
it
would
be
appropriate
to
confine
the
record
to
the
evidence
that
was
adduced
by
the
petitioner
at
the
suppression
hearing,
but
even
that
evidence
clearly
shows
that
there
were
two
justifications
known
to
the
police,
the
violence
risk,
which
i've
alluded
to,
and
the
potential
for
destruction
of
evidence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
court
recognized
in
the
sabbath
case
in
describing
the
common
law
that
destruction
of
evidence
was
a
permissible
ground
for
dispensing
with
knock
and
announce,
but
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
common
law,
as
it
evolved
in
england,
did
not
primarily
consider
the
question
of
entries
to
effectuate
search
warrants.
they
simply
weren't
used
very
often
before
the
constitution
was
adopted,
and
when
they
were
used,
they
tended
to
be
the
general
warrant,
which
excited
criticism
for
other
reasons.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
also,
of
course--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
well,
it
arose
in
the
context
of
arrest
warrants,
and
so
the
question
of
destruction
of
evidence
by
the
subject
of
the
arrest
was
really
less
of
a
focus,
and
it
has
to
be
noted
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
were
no
cases
that
evaluated
the
question
of
what
sort
of
requirements
attached
to
searches
by
the
police,
and
i
think
at
common
law
there
was
no
justification
for
searching
merely
for
evidence
at
all.
the
only
justifications
were
searching
for
contraband,
and
in
those
cases
there
wasn't
any
attention
paid
to
the
issue.
it's
probably
a
fair
inference
that
the
police
did,
indeed,
make
immediate
entries
to
prevent
destruction
of
evidence,
but
the
big
difference
is
technological.
there
was
no
indoor
plumbing,
and
as
a
result
of
that,
it
was
much
harder
to
destroy
any
significant
quantity--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
true,
if
it
were
lit,
and
if
the
police
were
coming
on
the
scene
at
a
time
when
it
could
be
done.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
o'connor.
our
position
is
that
if
the
exclusionary
rule
issue
were
to
be
reached
under
cases
from
this
court
such
as
segora
and
murray
and
new
york
v.
harris,
it
is
clear
that
the
warrant
that
the
police
possessed
justified
their
entry
into
the
house.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
it
would--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
is
a
certain
amount
of
ease
of
application
of
that
notion.
i
think
that
police
officers
in
the
field
are
entitled
to
guidance
on
the
question
of
when
and
under
what
circumstances
they
are
authorized
to
make
an
entry
without
a
prior
knock
and
announce.
it
is
not
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
they
are
authorized
to
do
so
in
every
case,
even
if
they
have
no
reasonable
justification
to
believe--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
i
think
that's
a
fair
way
to
read
our
brief,
and
the
way
the
case
law
has
developed
under
18
u.s.c.
3109.
there
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--for
this
purpose,
yes,
justice
kennedy.
there
may
be
a
distinction,
for
example,
if
based
on
confidential
informants
the
police
know
that
all
the
drugs
in
question
are
stored
in
relatively
indestructible
crates,
and
they
are
executing
a
search
warrant
at
a
warehouse.
they
probably
could
not
assume
that
any
destruction
of
the
evidence
that
they
were
searching
for
could
take
place,
but
in
the
average
situation,
when
executing
a
warrant
to
search
for
narcotics,
the
police
may
reasonably
assume
that
the
occupants
of
the
dwelling
will
make
some
effort
to
destroy
the
contraband.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
think,
justice
scalia,
that
it
entirely
swallows
the
rule.
it
certainly
would
apply
to
anything
that
could
be
readily
and
easily
destroyed
through
indoor
plumbing,
or
through...
for
example,
the
cases
have
dealt
with
raids
on
gambling
joints
in
which
the
slips
are
kept,
the
betting
slips
are
kept
on
flash
paper
which
can
easily
be
put
in
water,
and
that's
it's
water
soluble.
but
if
a
search
warrant
were
being
executed
for
stolen
televisions,
there
would
be
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
occupants
would
have
any
means
of
being
able
to
destroy
the
televisions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i...
my
response
to
that
is
twofold.
first,
we
believe
that
the
exceptions
to
a
knock-and-announce
rule,
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way,
that
we
advocate
are
consistent
with
the
way
the
doctrine
has
developed
in
common
law
cases
in
this
country,
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
that
3109
has
been
interpreted
by
the
lower
courts
as
incorporating
the
same
kind
of
reasonableness
analysis
as
we're
advocating
under
the
theory
that
3109,
which
was
enacted
in
1917,
was
a
restatement
of
the
common
law,
and
that
the
common
law
recognized
that
when
it
would
frustrate
the
object
of
a
search
to
knock
and
announce
before
entering,
it
wasn't
required,
or
when
the
police
faced
a
risk
of
danger
from
entering
with
a
knock--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
precisely
the
same
as
this
court's
construction
of
3109
in
every
respect.
the
most
significant
respect
in
which
i
would
differ
from
the
3109
cases
is
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
in
the
cases
that
this
court
had,
miller
and
sabbath,
under
3109
there
was
a
fairly
broad
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
which
may
have
been
appropriate
on
the
facts
of
those
cases
because
they
involved
warrantless
entries
to
a
home
to
make
an
arrest,
and
therefore
there
is
a
difference
in
these
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
none
of
this
court's
cases
under
3109
evaluated
whether
there
were
exceptions,
because
the
facts
didn't
present
them,
and
to
that
extent
those
cases
simply
didn't
present
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
we
don't
take
issue
with
the
idea
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
we
would
submit
that
a
reasonable
application
of
3109
would
produce
the
same
result--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--as
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
that
was
my
second
response
to
justice
scalia's
comment
on
the
common
law.
the
court
has
not
simply
frozen
common
law
rules
in
searches
and
seizures
into
constitutional
law,
but
has
used
the
common
law
background,
departing
from
it
when
reasonable
justifications
existed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
american
common
law
from
very
early
cases
in
this
country
did
recognize
that
when
it
would
be
counterproductive
to
knock
and
announce
before
making
the
entry,
such
as
by
provoking
a
felon
within
to
use
violence
to
repel
officers
who
were
there
to
arrest
them,
then
knock
and
announce
need
not
be
complied
with,
and
that
is
the
very
principle
that
we
are
contending
for
here
today
with
respect
to
the
risk
of
violence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
for
most
of
the
evidence
that
is
acquired
under
a
search
warrant,
that
is
true,
although
i
wouldn't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter,
because
the
presumption
that
if
police
had
applied
for
a
warrant
they
would
have
gotten
it
is
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
they
did
go
to
the
magistrate,
they
did
get
the
warrant,
and
they
are--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
warrant
that
they
possessed,
which
is
the
primary
source
of
protection
that
the
fourth
amendment
affords
to
privacy
and
against
unreasonable
searches,
authorized
them
to
acquire
this
evidence,
so
they
were
going
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
true.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
true,
but
this
court's
cases
that
have
examined
police
entries
into
dwellings
that
were
done
both
under
warrant
and
not
under
warrant
have
recognized
that
the
evidence
that
is
acquired
under
warrant
is
the
fruit
of
the
warrant.
even
if
a
warrantless
entry
had
previously
occurred
that
enabled
the
police
to
see
all
of
the
evidence,
and
that
thereby
would
justify
suppression
of
the
evidence
if
that's
all
there
was,
doesn't
require
suppression
of
evidence
when
there
is
a
valid
warrant,
and
that's
essentially
the
position
we're
taking
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
true,
justice
souter,
as
to
the
tangible
evidence
that
they
seize,
but
it
may
not
be
true
as
to
some
of
the
things
that
they
observe
upon
making
an
immediate
entry,
and
if
the
entry
is
unlawful,
a
court
could
suppress
things
that
they
observe--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
