mr.
hall,
does
it
make
a
difference
that
in
this
case
the
police
went
through
a
screen
door
that
was
closed
but
not
locked?
would
there
be...
is
there
a
constitutionally
relevant
distinction
between
that
and
ramming
the
door
open?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
in
this
case,
as
entries
go,
this
was
rather
mild,
was
it
not?
the
screen
door
that
was
shut
but
not
locked,
the
police
as
they
entered
said...
identified
themselves--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
respect
to
water,
mr.
hall,
is
the
advent
of
the
indoor
toilet
relevant
to
the
fourth
amendment
analysis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
it
apply
in
arkansas?
suppose
the
police
came
in
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
they
broke
down
the
door,
they
were
brutal
to
the
inhabitants,
but
they
did
have
a
warrant,
and
it
identified
what
they
found.
would
the
inevitable
discovery
rule,
as
arkansas
has
it,
apply
nonetheless?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
doesn't
that...
under
the
inevitable
discovery
rule,
isn't
that
all
beside
the
point?
they
had
a
valid
warrant.
if
they
had
been
well-behaved,
they
could
have
gone
in
and
found
all
those
things.
in
fact,
they
wrecked
the
place,
they
were
brutal--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
does
the
inevitable
discovery
rule
work
in
those
two
different
settings?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
reasonable
suspicion
that
evidence
will
be
destroyed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--wouldn't
that
be
so
in
so
many
of
these
narcotics
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
doesn't
knowledge
that
there's
a
gun
in
the
house
give
rise
to
the
safety
of
the
officer
concerned
and
the
presence
of
marijuana
in
a
place
with
indoor
plumbing
to
the
destruction
of
evidence?
what
more
would
you
need
to
come
within
even
the
traditional
exceptions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
not
a
blanket
exception
without
any
belief
in
the
facts,
these
facts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
gun
in
that
house.
we
know
that.
there's
a
warrant
to
search
for
narcotics.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
would
be
enough
to
have
a
concern
about
the
safety
of
the
officer?
you
say
the
presence
of
a
gun,
even
a
gun
named
in
the
warrant,
is
not
enough.
what
would
it
have
to
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
bryant,
what
is
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
arkansas
statute
that
says
to
make
an
arrest
an
officer
may
break
open
a
door
after
having
demanded
admittance
and
explain
the
purpose
for
which
admittance
is
desired?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
is
the
court's
rule
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
there's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
i
understand
it,
the
rules
are
silent.
i
could
see
if
a
rule
said,
you
can
arrest
without
knocking
and
announcing,
but
there
is
no
such
rule.
there's
a
statute,
and
there's
no
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
doesn't
address
warrants.
this
addresses
arrest
itself.
to
make
an
arrest,
an
officer,
et
cetera.
what
rule
addresses
the
officer's
conduct
in
making
the
arrest
that
conflicts
with
this
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
does
that
rule
say
about
how
the
officer
is
to
make
an
arrest?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
we
have
a
silent...
we
have
a
statute
that
says
one
thing.
we
have
a
rule
that
says
nothing
to
the
contrary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
that
respect,
do
you
make
a
difference
between
what
the
statute
requires
of
federal
officers
and
what
the
fourth
amendment
requires
of
all
officers?
is
there
something
more
because
there's
a
federal
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
you
to
be
saying,
though,
that
this
is
largely
an
academic
discussion,
because
if
you
have
a
warrant,
then
you
can
break
the
door
down,
you
can
be
brutal,
it
doesn't
matter
because
of
the
inevitable
discovery
rule.
