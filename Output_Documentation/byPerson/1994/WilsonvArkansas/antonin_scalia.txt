well
wait.
as
to
the
three
who
were
totally
innocent,
they
would
have
been
subjected
to
a
search
that
they
didn't
deserve
even
if
there
had
been
a
knock-and-announce.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
got
a
warrant
based
on
something
that
the
fourth
occupant
was
doing,
and
the
other
three
had
to
be
subjected
to
that,
so
that
doesn't
really
carry
a
whole
lot
of
weight,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
that
is--
--what
proof
is
needed?
what
proof
is
needed?
what
they
found
would
have
been
found
with
a
knock,
unless,
of
course,
it
had
been,
you
know,
chucked
down
a
commode,
but
that
would
be
an
unlawful
act,
to
destroy
evidence
like
that,
wouldn't
it?
are
you
saying
that
that's
a
valid
exception
to
the
inevitable
discovery
rule?
it
might
not
have
been
discovered
because
somebody
would
have
performed
a
criminal
act
that
would
have
prevented
its
discovery.
you
wouldn't
use
that
as
an
excuse,
surely.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that
isn't
the
point.
the
point
is
whether
it
is
a
defense
to
the
inevitable
discovery
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
you...
how
the
unlawful
destruction
of
contraband,
unlawful
destruction
could
possibly
be
a
defense
to
the
inevitable
discovery
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
can
do
it.
we
can
do
it,
but
i
think
our
normal
rule
is
that
any
judgment
can
be
defended
on
any
basis,
whether
we
granted
cert
particularly
on
that
or
not,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
need
not
allow
it,
but
we
certainly
may
allow
it.
and
we
say...
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
knock-and-announce
rule
of
the
common
law
is
constitutionally
mandated
under
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
the
common
rule
law
knock-and-announce
rule
is
not
constitutionally
mandated
under
the
fourth
amendment,
but
that
it
is
factor
to
be
considered,
then
surely
we
can
decide
on
these
facts
whether
the
factoring
was
done
properly,
if
we
choose
to
do
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
necessarily
concede,
do
you,
that
destruction
of
the
evidence
is
an
adequate
excuse
for
dispensing
with
knock-and-announce,
or
do
you
concede
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
we
generally
take
these
things
crime
by
crime.
i
really
don't
think--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
the
disappearance
of
the
indoor
fireplace
is
a
counterdevelopment--
[laughter]
--that
may
neutralize
the
whole
thing,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
exclude
the
evidence
that
would
have
been
found
anyway,
even
if
they
had
entered
properly?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
a
state
imposes
an
outrageous
tax,
i
mean,
you
know,
maybe
an
improper
penalty
for
an
outrageous
collection
of
a
tax
as
well?
i
mean,
that
also
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
evidence
would
have
been
found
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
you're
only
going
to
punish
them
for
those
irrelevant
things
that
occur
in
some
proximity
to
the
entry?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
irrelevant
to
whether
the
drugs
would
have
been
found
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
let
the
police
officer
calculate
those
odds.
you
may
be
right,
but
i
assume
that's
something
the
police
officer
takes
into
account
when
he
goes
crashing
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
you're
asking
us...
i
don't
find...
you
have
some
good
arguments,
but
i
don't
think
that's
one
of
them,
that
we
should
exercise
the
judgment
of
whether
it's
a
wise
thing
for
the
policeman
to
go
crashing
in
or
not,
from
his
standpoint.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
gun
plus
someone
who
is
reasonably
suspected
of
being
a
violent
person
willing
to
use
that
gun.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
bryant,
i'm
going
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
whether
i
think
there
was
a
knock-and-announce
rule
at
common
law
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted,
and
that
it
was
assumed
that
part
of
the
reasonableness
of
a
search
was
that
element.
now,
do
you
dispute
the
fact
that
there
was
at
common
law
a
general
rule
that
you
had
to
knock
and
announce
in
executing
a
warrant
for
a
home?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
dispute
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your
best
case
showing
that
such
a
rule
did
not
exist?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
are
they
in
your
brief,
and
how
old
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
page
22
of
your
brief,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--now,
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
the
knock-and-announce
rule.
i
don't
read
those
two
cases
as
saying
that
there
is
no
general
requirement
of
knock
and
announce.
it
seems
to
me
it's
possible
to
read
them
entirely
to
be
quite
consistent
with
other
cases
of
the
period,
that
there
is
a
general
requirement,
but
we
will
not
say
that
it
is
always
applicable
in
the
case
of
felonies,
which
would
mean
there's
a
general
rule,
but
of
course
there
are
exceptions
such
as
the
petitioner
here
is
perfectly
willing
to
admit.
there's
a
general
rule,
but
there's
an
exception
for
a
case
in
which
a
felon
is
inside
the
house
and
believed
to
be
armed.
perhaps
there's
an
exception
for
destruction
of
evidence.
but
you
say
there
is
no
general
principle
at
all.
isn't
that
what
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
about
all
the
cases
that
seem
to
announce
such
a
general
principle?
justice
antonin
scalia
many
cite
it
in
the
brief
for
petition.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
for
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
time
to
fall
back,
general
bryant,
i
think.
thank
you,
general
bryant.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
in
this
case,
just
say
that
there
is
some
such
general
requirement?
you
want
us
to
affirm
the
decision
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your
best
case
for
that?
what's
your
best
case,
in
fact
your
best
two
cases,
for
saying
that
the
destruction
of
evidence
is
an
exception
from
the
general
common
law
requirement
that
you
knock
and
announce?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
still
knock
and
announce,
warrant
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
you
mean,
they
didn't
search
homes
before
the
revolution?
they
did
it
without
a
warrant.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
almost
anything
else.
why
just
narcotics?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you're...
once
you
say
that
a
valid
exception
to
the
rule
is
the
destruction
of
evidence,
the
possible
destruction
of
evidence,
it
seems
to
me
in
the
average
search,
whether
it's
for
narcotics
or
not,
you
could
assume
that
once
the
person
hears
a
knock...
you
know,
i'm
a
policeman
here
with
a
search
warrant...
whatever
you're
looking
for,
with
few
exceptions,
bales
of
marijuana,
but
if
it's,
you
know,
stolen
jewelry,
chuck
it
down
the
toilet,
whatever.
it
seems
to
me
you're
making
an
exception
that
swallows
up
the
general
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
wonder
whether
that's
a
good
enough
exception
to
come
in
without
knocking
into
a
house,
especially
as
you
tell
me
that
in
common
law
you
couldn't
go
in
for
evidence
anyway,
at
all,
even
with
knock
and
announce.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
you're
saying
you
can
not
only
go
in
to
get
evidence,
but
you
can
do
it
without
knocking
and
announcing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
that's...
but
it's
a
further
question
to
say
not
only
are
we
going
to
let
you
go
in
to
look
for
evidence
when
you
couldn't
do
it
before,
but
the
obtaining
of
that
evidence
we
are
also
going
to
allow
to
dispense
with
the
common
law
requirement
of
knock
and
announce.
that's
a
big
additional
step,
it
seems
to
me,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
simply
to
say
you
can
get
it
means
that
you
also
have
to
say,
moreover,
when...
if
knocking
and
announce
wouldn't
permit
you
to
get
it,
you
can
dispense
with
knock
and
announce.
that
seems
to
me
quite
an
additional
step.
