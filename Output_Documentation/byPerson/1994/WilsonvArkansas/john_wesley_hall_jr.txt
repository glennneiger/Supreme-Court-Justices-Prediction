mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
fundamental
issue
of
the
interrelationship
between
the
common
law
and
the
bill
of
rights,
particularly
the
fourth
amendment.
the
case
came
here
on
a
very
limited
grant
of
cert
because
of
the
stark
way
the
issue
was
decided
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
that
is,
that
there
is
no
knock-and-announce
requirement
in
the
fourth
amendment.
in
response
to
our
briefs,
in
response
to
that
petition
for
cert
and
the
grant
of
cert,
my
opponents
have
tried
to
turn
the
issue
on
its
head,
in
effect
turning
the
fourth
amendment
on
its
head,
and
i'll
just
cut
right
to
the
chase
of
the
argument.
what
they're
saying
is...
the
solicitor
general
says,
the
more
drugs
you've
got,
the
more
right
you
have
to
an
announcement.
the
less
drugs
you've
got,
the
less
right
you
have
to
announcement,
and
then
the
state's
position
is
that
if
you're
completely
innocent
you
really
don't
have
any
rights
at
all,
and
i
submit
to
you
that
that
turns
the
fourth
amendment
on
its
head.
everybody
in
this
country
has
a
right
to
be
free
in
their
home
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
and
this
falls
within
the
reasonableness
clause
whether
you're
innocent
or
you're
guilty.
in
this
particular
case,
there
were
three
people
in
this
house
who
were
totally
innocent
of
any
wrongdoing,
and
they
were
subjected
to
the
same
search,
and
i
direct
you
to
page
379
of
the
record,
where
we
tried
to
get
ricki
cates,
sharlene
wilson's
son--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--that's
true.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
i
think
it
carries
weight
because
in
the
context
of,
the
innocent
inside
a
home
have
as
much
right
to
a
knock-and-announce
as
the
guilty.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
ricki
cates
lived
in
the
home,
her
son.
he
was
11
at
the
time
of
the
search.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
no.
they
were
visiting.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
if...
the
olson
case,
minnesota
v.
olson,
we're
told
that
guests
have
standing
in
a
house.
i
would
say
they
do.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
that's
true,
but
don't...
doesn't
any
guest
in
a
home
have
some
standing--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--to
be
free
from
a
search?
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
it
doesn't.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
that's
true,
but
i
think
it
underscores
the
issue
of
the
innocent
having
as
much
right
as
the
guilty,
in
this
case
because
there
were
three
other
people
in
the
house,
and
as
i
was
referring
to
the
record,
at
page
379
we
tried
to
get
ricki
cates
to
testify
at
trial.
his
father,
who
is
now
custodial
because
sharlene
is
in
jail,
testified
that
he
was
traumatized
by
this
arrest...
he
said
the
arrest.
he
didn't
say
the
search,
but
the
arrest...
and
was
in
psychological
treatment
as
a
result.
he
did
not
want
him
to
testify,
and
he
did
not,
but
it
shows
the
impact
that
these
arrests
can
have
on
innocent
people.
i
suppose
drug
dealers
consider
being
arrested
and
having
their
house
broken
into
as
a
risk
of
doing
business.
most
of
them
do.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
that
doesn't
even--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--bring
in
the
plaintiff
inevitable
discovery
doctrine.
that's
the
useless
gesture
exception
to
the
knock-and-announce
requirement.
but
let
me
take
this
one
step
backward,
that
the
state
never
raised
an
exception
below.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well,
you
have
other
cases.
it
would
be
open
for
the
trial
court
when
it
goes
back,
if
it
goes
back.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
but
the
state
could
raise,
i
suppose,
any
ground,
and
in
this
case
i'll
concede
that
all
three
grounds
are
possible.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
but
there's
not
any
concrete
proof
on
anything,
because
at
the
suppression
hearing
the
state
put
on
no
evidence
and
cross-examined
no
witnesses.
they
made
no
argument.
i
rested
my
case
on
the
motion,
the
trial
judge
said
motion
denied,
with
no
findings,
so
we
would
have
to
go
back,
but
i
would
agree
that
on
remand
the
state
would
have
the
opportunity
to
put
on
proof
as
to
all
of
these
issues.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
no,
but
destruction
of
evidence
under
arkansas
law
is
a
rather
minor
felony
compared
to
the
possession
of
a
drug.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--well,
inevitable
discovery
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
either,
because
that's
not
within
the
grant
of
cert.--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--no,
because
the
state
is
using
the
inevitable
discovery
rule
as
an
opportunity
to
salvage
the
search,
but
then
on
the
other
hand
they
argue
we
have
to
enter
without
announcement
to
make
sure
it's
there,
so
if
they
have
to
enter
without
announcement
to
make
sure
it's
there,
that's
not
inevitable
discovery.
they're
planning
to
make
it
there.
they're
trying
to
ensure
it's
there
by
their
entry,
and--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--there
could
be
on
the
issue
of
reasonableness,
and
in
this
case
it
could
also
go
to
whether
or
not
they
could
look
through
the
door
and
see
that
they
were
police
officers,
because
it
was
a
screen
door.
now,
there
is--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--they
identified
themselves.
they
had
no
weapons
drawn.
after
they
got
inside
they
did.
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record,
but
it's
not
a
part
of
the
suppression
hearing,
that
they
heard
sharlene
wilson
running
to
the
bathroom
to
dispose
of
drugs,
and
in
her
cross-examination
at
the
trial
on
the
merits
she
admitted
that
she
was
in
the
bathroom
flushing
drugs
after
she
previously
denied
it.
she
denied
it
and
then
admitted
it,
so--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--that's
correct,
and
the
reasonableness--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--it
would
go
back
to
determine
the
reasonableness
overall.
the
state
could
plead
that
they
really
knew
that
police
were
out
there,
therefore
they
were
not
surprised.
the
state
could
argue
that
the
presence
of
a
gun
created
a
peril
issue,
which
is
seriously
in
dispute
because
they
had
their
own
guns
holstered
when
they
came
in.
they
didn't
it...
consider
they
had
a
serious
dispute.
and
then
the
destruction
of
property,
the
destruction
of
the
evidence,
i
submit
to
you
this
case
is
a
good
example
that
the
destruction
of
evidence
overall
really
doesn't
mean
a
whole
lot.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
i
look
at
it
a
different
way,
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
announcement.
the
exceptions
are
based
on
reasonableness,
and
the
exceptions
can
come
into
play
and
conceivably
other
exceptions
could
be
envisioned
in
the
future.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
it's
still...
knock-and-announce
becomes
a
fourth
amendment
requirement
because
it's
part
of
reasonableness.
arkansas
rejected
that
completely,
and
you
would
have
to...
at
least
if
you
found
that,
you'd
have
to
remand
it
back
to
decide
whether
or
not
what
the
police
did
here
was
reasonable.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
you
have
to
draw
the
inference
but
there's
no
evidence
of
it.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
somebody
told
efird
that,
she's
gone
to
the
bathroom.
go
get
her.
he
was--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--he
was
next-to-last
through
the
door,
or
something
like
that.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
all
that
shows
is
an
inference
that
she
ran
to
the
bathroom.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
you
could
guess
that
well,
maybe
she
was
in
there
flushing
drugs,
but
even
if
she
did
flush
drugs,
in
this
case
they've
testified
there
was
residue
in
the
toilet.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
that
was
in
the
affidavit--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--i
introduced
the
warrant.
they
didn't.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
the
trial--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--it
was,
but--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--because
the
exceptions
weren't
a
part
of
a
grant
of
cert,
and
i
direct
the
court
to
gates
v.
illinois,
pages
223,
where
the
court
sent
a
case...
or
asked
the
case
to
be
rebriefed
on
the
question
of
the
good
faith
exception.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
i
think
you
probably
could,
and
i
would
concede
that
on
remand
i
don't
know
that
the
proof
would
get
much
better.
i
would
assume
that
all
the
officers
that
were
there
would
be
called,
instead
of
just
two
of
them,
and
also
the
two
cotherns,
and
possibly
ricki
cates,
so
we'd
have
ten
additional
witnesses
to
call.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
all
the
case
law
under
the
federal
statute
has
said
possession
of
a
gun
alone
is
not
enough,
and
we
include--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--in
some
cases
you
could
make
that
assumption.
i
guess
it
depends
on
the
level
of
the
dealer.
in
this
case,
we
had
a
low
level
dealer,
but
we
did
have
positive
evidence
of
a
gun.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
it's
not,
but
i
want
to
counter
that
with
another
view,
that
in
this
case,
for
example,
by
the
time
they
got
the
search
warrant,
they
had
charges
on
her
for
three
separate
sales,
and
she
got
31
years
as
a
result
of
the
sales.
as
a
result
of
the
search,
she
got
an
$11,000
fine
and
a
year
in
jail,
so
the
graver
crimes
are
what
give
them
a
probable
cause
for
making
entry
in
the
first
place.
by
the
time
they
go
in,
they've
got
them
on
something.
ninety-five
times
out
of
100,
they've
done
a
drug
deal
somewhere
else,
the
police
have
it
documented,
and
that's
what
their
probable
cause
for
the
entry
is.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
it
depends,
i
would
say...
to
some
extent
i
have
to
agree
with
the
government
on
that,
but
if
it's
a
small
quantity
of
drugs,
you've
already
got
them
on
a
felony
that
could
get
them
life
imprisonment
and
you're
going
into
possess,
you're
probably
just
as
well
off
that
they
flushed
it.
the
drugs
are
out
of
circulation.
you're
going
to
get
them
on
a
significant
crime.
they
test
the
water--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--say
we've
got
residue--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--by
the
time
they
go
in,
though,
they've
got
them.
what
they're
trying
to
do
is--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--we're
not
asking
them
to
ignore
the
crime.
they've
got
the
right
to
go
in
the
house
and
conduct
the
search
for
whatever.
if
they
find
drug
paraphernalia,
the
wrappings
of
drugs
is
going
to
have
residue
on
it,
they
will
be
charged
with
that.
they
can
test
the
water.
they
can
turn
off
the
water.
there
are
all
kinds
of
things
they
can
do
that
are
still
going
to
get
that
person
arrested.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
to
some
extent,
it
is,
but
even
at
common
law
people
had
stoves,
they
had
pots
in
the
house
that
had
water
in
it,
and
if
you
had
cocaine
back
in
the
sixteenth
century
they
could
have
disposed
of
it
that
way.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
we
go
from
the
stove
in
the
house
to
central
heat
to
having
indoor
plumbing.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
we
do.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
they
also
had
an
arrest
warrant
for
the
sales
that
occurred...
the
three
sales
that
occurred
prior,
or
at
least
two
of
the
sales.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
there
may
have
been
a
third.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
if
it
does,
in
fact
apply.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
if
it
applies,
but
i
dispute
that
it
applies
because
of
their
own
admissions
and
the
way
they
argued
the
issue,
that
it
has...
we
have
to
make
the
entry
to
make
sure
it's
there,
therefore
it
is
the
but-for
reason
that
it's
found.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
i
think
not.
i
agree.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
it
does.
there
was
a
case
decided
about
12
or
15
years
ago
where
they
adopted
it.
they
said,
albeit
reluctantly,
but
they
do
agree
with
reasonable
discovery,
and
it
was
i
think
pre
nix
v.
williams,
or
around
that
time,
but
it
does
consider
the
rule,
and
i
think
they
would
possibly
apply
it
here,
though,
depending
on
how
we
were
to
counter
the
argument.
they
didn't
get
that
issue
below.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well,
it's
the
way
it
was
phrased
in
the
opinion.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
it's--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--we
don't
know
about
arkansas
law,
but
i
would
counter
that
with,
what
about
the
overall
reasonableness
about
the
way
this
search
was
conducted?
can
such
an
abuse--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--well--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--my
response
to
that
would
be
a
kind
of
remedial
response.
that
is,
that
if
the
reasonableness
requirement
is
not
satisfied
by
the
way
the
entry
is
conducted
because
they
terrorized
children
at
gunpoint,
in
one
case
we
found
they
did
a
genital
search
of
somebody,
and
no
drugs
were
found
in
the
house,
then
a
court
could
say,
this
is
just
so
outrageous
we
can't
countenance
this
entry,
and
go
ahead
and
stress
it
anyway.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
if
their
conduct
was
so
outrageous
that
it
far
surpassed
reasonableness.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well,
taxes
aren't
normally
imposed
at
gunpoint.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
it's
not
irrelevant.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well,
if
you
say
that
the
drugs
wouldn't
have
been
flushed
in
any
event,
if
there
were
so
many
drugs
they
would
have
always
been
found,
no
matter
what,
you
know,
how
do
you
remedy
a
police
abuse
when
they
come
in
like
that?
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
they
have
a
possible
cause
of
action.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
whether
or
not
it
would
actually
go
anywhere,
i
doubt
seriously.
i've
litigated
a
few
of
those
types
of
police
misconduct
cases,
not
in
this
exact
context,
but
the
burden
of
proof
is
so
high
the
police
officer
already
has
every
presumption
in
the
world
in
his
favor
in
a
jury
room.
that's...
you
have
to
prove
them
liable
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
all
practical
purposes.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
no,
that's
the
practical
burden.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
i'm
talking
the
reality,
because
i've
tried
enough
of
them
to
know
that
in
your
own
mind
you've
proved
it
by
a
preponderance,
but
the
jury
still
says,
well,
they're
police
officers.
we're
going
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
that's
the
way
it
works,
and
to
some
extent
that
may
be
a
valid
response
by
a
jury.
sometimes
it's
not.
the
question
of
protecting
the
innocent
inside
a
search
in
this
type
of
case,
protecting
everybody
from
unnecessary
violence,
is
a
separate
question
from
the
authority
to
search.
yes,
they
have
the
authority
to
search,
but
how
they
conduct
it,
the
reasonableness
of
the
search,
is
always
an
issue.
it
always
has
been.
there's
always
the
question
of
who
else
may
be
home.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
surveillance.
the
police
just
drove
up
and
went
right
inside,
and
they
didn't
know
who
was
in
there.
they
could
have
surveilled
the
house,
waited
for
somebody
to
come
out
and
arrested
them.
presumably
the
innocent
parties
wouldn't
know
where
the
drugs
were.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
in
the
context
of
where
somebody
is,
in
fact,
guilty
of
the
crime,
i'd
say
then
that
would
not
be
an
appropriate
case
for
suppression
of
the
evidence,
but
what
i'm
thinking
about
is
the
overall
reasonableness
of
when
the
police
come
in,
what
do
they
know,
what
about
the
innocent
people
inside,
what
about
the--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--if
he
is
truly
innocent
and
squeaky
clean,
he'd
have
a
fairly
good
cause
of
action
and
could
probably
prevail.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
in
your
hypothetical
i'd
say
no,
because
the
overall
reasonableness
of
the
search
that
produced
the
evidence
would
not...
or
that
would
not
be
unreasonable,
under
that
situation,
because
it
didn't
involve
the
people
who
were
the
target
of
the
search,
and
the
other
officers
acted
with
restraint.
and
if
they
said,
wait
a
minute,
you're
out
of
control,
stop
whatever
you're
doing,
if
they
exercise
their
authority
as
police
officers,
they
stopped
somebody
out
of
control,
and
i
think
that
could
come
in
as
being
reasonable.
but
if
it
just
completely
got
out
of
hand
like
the
rodney
king
videotape
we've
seen,
which
obviously
can
happen
because
it
happened
there,
then
who
knows,
and
we've
given
examples
in
the
briefs
from
the
empirical
evidence
of
cases
where
some
police
officers
actually
did
go
berserk
in
houses,
trashed
the
place,
harmed
people,
and
then
find
no
evidence
and
just
get
up
and
leave
without
even
apologizing.
i
mean,
it
happens.
it
doesn't
happen
a
lot
necessarily,
but
not
many
of
those
cases
are
going
to
make
it
up
here
because
of
the
nature
of
this
court's
review.
i
also
submit
that
the
rule
protects
police
safety
as
well
as
citizen
safety.
one
thing
my
opponents
rely
on
is
the
fact
that
firearms
were
a
lot
more
plentiful
and
a
lot
more
effective
now
than
they
were
at
the
time
semayne's
case
was
decided,
which
is
true,
but
if
you
think
about
semayne's
case,
when
they're
talking
about
the
possibility
of
hand-to-hand
combat
when
somebody
comes
in,
at
least
you've
got
an
opportunity
there
to
explain
while
they're
arguing,
or
they're
fighting,
or
they're
tussling
on
the
floor.
but
when
you've
got
a
gun
that
holds
15
rounds,
like
a
9
mm
does,
you
can
empty
that
clip
in
no
time
before
anybody
can
ask
any
questions.
if
they
just
see
something
in
somebody's
hand
and
think,
that's
a
gun,
and
they
open
fire
and
it
turns
out
to
be
an
ashtray,
as
in
one
case
where
a
man
was
shot,
all
these
situations
bear
on
the
ultimate
question
of
knock
and
announce.
police
officers
have
a
right
to
be
protected
in
their
own
safety.
now,
they
will
say
in
response
that
when
they
come
in
they're
a
target.
they're
a
target
only
when
somebody's
really
crazy,
and
they
know
that
there
is,
in
fact,
a
gun
inside.
most
of
the
time
people
are
not
going
to
risk
violence
when
there's
children
inside
the
house,
for
instance,
or
a
small
amount
of
drugs.
they're
not
going
to
kill
somebody
over
a
small
amount
of
drugs.
if
they're
drug
dealers
they
know
getting
arrested
is
a
risk,
and
they're
going
to
go
ahead
and
do
their
time.
the
real
risk,
i
submit
to
you,
is
from
people
who
fear
that
people
coming
in
are
other
people
who
will
rob
them,
and
that
does,
in
fact,
happen.
drug
dealers
rip
each
other
off
sometimes,
and
they
come
in
at
gunpoint
and
take
the
stuff,
and
when
that
happens,
what's
the
normal
response?
a
normal
response
is
to
shoot,
and
the
police
officer
could
get
accidentally
shot.
if
the
person
knew
it
was
the
police,
he
says,
wait
a
minute,
i'm
not
going
to
do
anything
to
them.
i'm
not
going
to
risk
a
capital
murder
charge
over
a
possession
of
marijuana
charge.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
and
we
let
them
at
their
own
folly
take
the
risk
of
getting
shot?
that's
the
counter
to
that.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well,
but
he
could
make
that
determination
based
on
what
he
knows
at
the
scene,
starting
from
the
principle
that
we
have
an
announcement
requirement,
but
can
it
be
dispensed
with
in
this
case
for
whatever
reason,
and
if
it
can
be
dispensed
with,
i'm
sure
they'll
be
able
to
justify
it.
the
exceptions,
we
agree,
the
three
exceptions
have
been
around
for
150
years
as
well.
there
are
common
law
cases
recognizing
these
exceptions,
and
we
don't
dispute
that
they
would
apply
now,
and
when
they
get
there,
if
they
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing,
by...
and
i
would
agree,
even
if
you
get
to
that
point,
that
reasonable
suspicion
has
to
be
the
standard
under
bowie.
if
they
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
some
violence
might
occur,
they
can
come
in.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
possibly
the
same
as
well.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
but
bowie--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--well,
we
have
to
remember,
bowie
is
based
on
safety
of
the
officer.
destruction
of
evidence
is
not
based
on
safety
of
the
officer,
and
you
might
end
up
having
to
have
two
standards:
probable
cause
for
destruction
of
evidence,
reasonable
suspicion
for
safety
to
the
officer.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
because
then
you're
creating
a
blanket
exception
without
any
belief
in
the
facts.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--if
the
warrant
is
to
search
for
narcotics,
then
you've
created
a
blanket
exception
that
the
police
can
enter
any
time
that
drugs
are
involved,
and
since
42
percent
of
all
american
households
have
guns
in
them,
can
you
say
that
there's
a
reasonable
suspicion
there's
a
gun
in
the
house?
if
you
say
that,
there's
no
knock
and
announce.
there's
no
need
for
it
any
more.
and
then,
if
that
happens,
then
we're
all--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--in
this
case,
i
think
you
could
say
there
was
enough
in
this
case
because
you've
got
an
alleged
threat
to
the
informant.
you've
got
a
threat
of
force
by
the
use
of
that
gun,
not
just
the
mere
presence
of
a
gun,
but
a
suggestion
that
a
gun
would
be
used,
and
i
would
agree
that
that
would
have
to
be
enough
to
get
over
that.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
willing
to
use
the
gun.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
if
the
guy's
got
a
history
of
beating
up
people,
i
would
say
that
would
be
enough,
given
the
presence
of
a
gun
as
well,
but
these
are
all
hypotheticals
that
are
way
beyond
the
facts.
but
just
the
mere
presence
of
a
gun
in
the
cases
under
the
federal
statute
hasn't
been
enough.
but
there's
one
curious
case
that
the
solicitor
general
cites
where
a
guy
was
wearing
a
bullet
proof
vest.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
that
would
be
enough.
