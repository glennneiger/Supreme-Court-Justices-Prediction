do
you
suppose
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine
is
applicable
in
these
situations,
so
that
evidence,
in
any
event,
wouldn't
be
excluded.
go
back
to
the
empty
house.
you
say
the
constitution
requires
knock
and
announce,
and
if
the
police
don't
do
it
and
the
house
is
empty,
but
the
drugs
are
there
and
they
have
a
search
warrant
for
the
house,
they
go
in,
they
get
the
drugs,
the
evidence
would
have
to
be
excluded,
or
would
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--make
it
admissible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
presumably
it
would
be
open
to
the
court
if
it
had
to
go
back.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
this.
there
was...
you
concede
that
the
police
did
have
a
valid
search
warrant--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
the
house.
did
they
have
an
arrest
warrant
as
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
if
there
is,
indeed,
an
inevitable
discovery
doctrine
that
is
applicable
here,
perhaps
it
isn't
necessary
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
determine
what
the
risk
of
guns
was,
or
anything
of
that
kind,
because
presumably
the
evidence
wouldn't
be
suppressed
in
any
event
if
the
inevitable
discovery
rule
applies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
wouldn't
be
a
factual
determination
to
make,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
a
pure
legal
question.
it
doesn't
require
further
fact-finding
to
decide
whether
the
inevitable
discovery
rule
applies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
have
a
lawsuit,
don't
you,
under
1983?
presumably
if
the
police
are
abusive,
the
victims
have
a
valid
civil
lawsuit,
do
they
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
not
the
legal
burden
of
proof.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you're
just
talking
practicalities.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
the
matter
with
the
proposal
of
the
solicitor
general,
that
would
certainly
take
into
account
the
long
common
law
tradition?
i,
for
one,
can't
buy
your
proposal
at
all.
you
have
no
comment
on
what
the
solicitor
general
proposes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there's
a
very
long
tradition
here
that
has
to
be
taken
into
account,
and
the
fact
that
the
officers
don't
knock
and
announce
certainly
at
a
minimum
ought
to
be
a
factor
in
what's
reasonable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
except
for
the
fireplace--
--the
fireplace.
--or
the
hot
stove.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
could
just
toss
it
right
in.
you
could
destroy
papers
better
in
a
fireplace
than
in
the
commode.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
dreeben,
what
about
the
inevitable
discovery
notion.
do
you
think
that
that
doctrine
is
applicable
here,
so
that
the
evidence
would
not
be
suppressed
in
any
event?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then,
what's
the
point
of
trying
to
decide
some
factual
issue
where
there
are
no
findings
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it
would
be
certainly
much
simpler
to
deal
with
it
on
the
inevitable
discovery
theory.
