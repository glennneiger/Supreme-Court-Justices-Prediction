chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-5707,
sharlene
wilson
v.
arkansas.
mr.
hall--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
three
live
in
the
home?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
others
you're
referring
to
live
in
the
home?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
do
you
think
they
had
the
same
rights
as
a
dweller
in
the
house?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
an
overnight
guest,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
think
you're
making
some
generalizations
that
perhaps
require
a
little
more
refinement
than
you're
giving
them.
surely
your
position
doesn't
depend
upon
the
presence
or
the
absence
of
other
people
who...
persons
other
than
are
named
in
the
warrant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
difference
is
there
between
the
knock-and-announce
rule
as
a
part
of
the
fourth
amendment
with
some
exceptions
to
it,
which
i
gather
is
your
position,
and
the
position
taken
by
the
solicitor
general
that
the
knock-and-announce
rule
is
a
factor
to
be
considered
in
determining
overall
reasonableness?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
what
difference
does
it
make,
say,
in
a
typical
case
if
you
apply
one
rule
or
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
in
the
course
of
a
very
rough
search
the
authorities
physically
beat
up
on
someone
who
was
never
then
charged
with
anything?
does
that
mean
that
the
people
who
are
charged
with
something
and
for
whom
they
had
a
warrant
and
stuff
was
found
in
the
house,
that
they
can
rely
on
the
beating
up
of
a
person
who
had...
who
was
not
charged?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
overall
reasonableness,
supposing
you've
got
three
police
coming
into
this
house,
and
one
of
them
is
a
maverick,
and
he
simply
sees
the
first
person
inside
the
house
and
just
hits
them
with
his
billy,
or
whatever
they
take
on
these
raids.
the
other
two
policemen
go
about
their
business
just
the
way
they
should,
find
the
evidence
and
the
two
people
against
whom
the
evidence
they
found
are
charged.
the
person
who
is
hit
with
the
billy
club
is
not
charged.
what
result
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
could
the
two
who
are...
against
whom
charges
are
made
try
to
suppress
the
evidence
found
in
the
house
on
the
basis
of
this
one
maverick
officer's
beating
up
of
someone
who
is
not
charged?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
hall.
general
bryant,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dreeben,
i
take
it
that
in
our
decision
in
warden
v.
hayden,
which
i
guess
was
the
late
sixties,
we
have
already
departed
from
the
common
law
in
construing
the
fourth
amendment,
since
we
there
held
that
you
could
search
for
evidence
and
the
common
law
didn't
permit
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
number
94-5707,
wilson
against
arkansas
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
