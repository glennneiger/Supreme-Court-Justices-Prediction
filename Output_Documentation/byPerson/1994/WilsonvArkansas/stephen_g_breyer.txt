justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
about
that?
this
is
just
a
technical
question,
but
you've
been
talking
about
what
was
in
the
suppression
hearing.
i
don't
know...
legally,
does
it
matter
if
the
evidence
was
in
the
suppression
hearing
or
at
the
trial?
that's
one
question.
the
other
is,
i
have
in
my
transcript
here
which...
you
know,
in
the
record
here,
a
lot
of
evidence
on
page
39
and
so
forth
that's
titled
"suppression
hearing".
isn't
that
the
suppression
hearing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
they
say,
you
know,
was
she
in
the
bathroom,
say
i
didn't
see
weapons
drawn,
but
he
says,
i
went
straight
to
the
bathroom
where
mrs.
wilson
was.
why?
apparently
she'd
run
to
the
bathroom.
now,
we
know
she'd
run
to
the
bathroom
to
flush
the
drugs
down
the
toilet,
and
so
why
would
you
have
to...
and
you
say
in
your
brief
that
it's
a
common
law
exception,
destruction
of
evidence,
because
you
say
possible
destruction
of
evidence,
so
why
isn't
it
right
there
in
the
suppression
hearing
that
she
ran
to
the
bathroom
to
flush
the...
you
know,
you
have
to
draw
the
inference
she
ran
there
to
flush
the
drugs
down
the
toilet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
is
the
evidence
where
he
says
because
she'd
run
to
the
bathroom?
why
isn't
that
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
well,
why
isn't
all
that
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
okay,
so
it's
evidence.
there
also...
wasn't
it
introduced
in
the
suppression
hearing,
the
warrant
itself,
and
wasn't
there
an
affidavit
attached
to
the
warrant
which
said
that
she
only
a
few
days
earlier
had
had
a
chrome-handled
pistol
that
she
had
used
to
threaten
with
serious
physical
harm
the
confidential
informant?
wasn't
that
in
the
suppression--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
wouldn't
that
have
been
part
of
the
evidence
at
the
suppression
hearing,
because
they
must
have
introduced
the
warrant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
i
mean,
was
it...
the
question
is...
my
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--wasn't
that
there
in
the
suppression
hearing,
and
if
it
was,
isn't
that
evidence
of
what
you
call
peril?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
why
would
we
have
to
send
this
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
it
reasonable...
you
don't
have
to
go...
they
go
back
to
edward
i.
i
didn't
even
know
whether
he
invaded
scotland,
or
whatever,
but
they
trace
it
back
to
edward
i,
and
even
today,
isn't
it
still
a
reasonable
thing
that
you
shouldn't
knock
down
the
door
of
somebody's
house
where
you're
not
afraid
of
any
harm,
and
you
don't
have
any
reason
to
think
somebody's
going
to
destroy
evidence?
i
mean,
why
isn't
that
a
reasonable
thing,
in
that
instance,
even
if
it
weren't
going
back
to
edward
i,
and
if
you
are,
well,
so
much
the
stronger?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know
that
they'd
require...
you'd
require
it
because
it's
reasonable,
and
unreasonable
not
to
knock
and
announce
where
they're
not
going
to
destroy
any
evidence,
you
have
no
reason
for
thinking
so,
you
have
no
reason
for
thinking
there's
any
danger,
and
there's
this
pedigree
in
history
saying
that
it's
unreasonable
under
those
circumstances.
what's
the
answer
to
that?
