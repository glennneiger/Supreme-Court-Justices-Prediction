justice
david
h.
souter
--your
position
is,
i
take
it,
that
there
is
a
general
rule
that
the
search
is
unreasonable,
prima
facie
unreasonable,
if
they
enter
without
knocking
and
announce,
in
the
absence
of
some
exceptions
which
are
not
before
us.
is
that
in
a
nutshell--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
that's
why
that
covers
this
case.
this
case
may
be
on
the
fringes
if
we
did
not
have
a
general
rule,
but
if
we
have
a
general
rule,
this
case
falls
within
it,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
general
bryant,
do
you
deny
that
it
is
a
relevant
consideration
in
determining
whether
the
entry
was,
and
the
search
was
reasonable?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
deny
it,
or
do
you
agree
that
it
is
a
relevant
consideration?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
my
question
is,
is
it
a
relevant
consideration
in
determining
whether
a
search
is
reasonable
or
not?
may
they
consider
the
fact
that
there
either
was
a
knock
and
announce,
or
there
was
not
a
knock
and
announce?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
literally,
if
the
state
presented
evidence
and
said,
we
knocked
on
the
door
and
started
to
say
we're
police
officers
and
there's
an
objection,
the
judge
would
say,
strike
that,
that
is
totally
irrelevant
evidence?
i
mean,
you're
really
going
that
far?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
isn't
the
same
reasoning,
then,
sufficient
whenever
there's
a
search
without
a
warrant,
where
a
warrant
would
be
required
by
general
rules?
you
would
simply
argue,
well,
if
they
had
done
what
they
should
have
done
and
gotten
the
warrant,
they
would
have
found
the
evidence
anyway.
isn't
the
structure
of
the
argument
the
same
in
each
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
any
more
bizarre
than
saying
that
if
they
had
knocked
and
announced
they
would
have
done
the
right
thing
and
they
just
didn't
happen
to
knock
and
announce?
in
each
case,
we...
the
assumption
of
the
question
is,
they
could
have
done
what
the
fourth
amendment
requires.
they
didn't
do
it.
but
the
argument
in
each
case
seems
to
be,
or
the
argument
in
the
inevitable
discovery
application
that
you're
arguing
for
is,
if
they
had
done
the
right
thing,
they
would
have
gotten
the
same
evidence
they
got
by
doing
the
wrong
thing.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that
begs
the
question
whether
it
authorized
them
to
go
in
in
a
manner
which
under
a
general
rule,
or
a
rule
that
takes
into
consideration
knock
and
announce,
was
unreasonable.
it
didn't
authorize
them
to
make
an
unreasonable
search.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
got
them
to
the
threshold,
is
what
i'm
saying.
it
didn't
necessarily
get
them
over
the
threshold.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
i
don't
know
why
we're
arguing
about
knock
and
announce,
because
the
evidence
is
always
going
to
be
inside
if
they
arrived
with
a
warrant,
and
it's
going
to
be
there
whether
they
knocked
or
whether
they
didn't
knock.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
was
going
to
say,
that's
not
what
you're
arguing
would
be
inevitably
discovered.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
