justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
part
that
i
might
be
a
little
confused
about,
that
i
need
clarification
about,
is
this.
imagine
that
you
are
the
immigrant,
and
now
on
day
1,
down
comes
an
order.
it
says,
go.
now,
on
the
government's
interpretation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
a
final--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
no
reconsideration,
final
order,
go,
and
on
the
government's
interpretation,
i
know
what
i'm
supposed
to
do.
i
go
and
appeal
immediately.
that
stays
the
whole
business.
i
file
a
petition
for
reconsideration.
when
that's
finally
decided
i
can
appeal
that,
too,
and
the
thing
will
be
consolidated.
all
right.
i
can
understand
how
that
works.
now
take
your
interpretation.
your
interpretation,
i
sit
there,
i
get
the
order,
it
says,
go.
i'm
not
sure
i
know
what
i
want
to
do.
if,
after
all,
i
file
a
petition
for
reconsideration,
i
no
longer
can
appeal
the
order
saying
go.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
things
drag
on,
the
time
will
expire.
maybe
they'll
deport
me,
so
i
might
have
to
give
up...
i
have
to
make
a
choice.
either
i...
i'm...
i
can't
really
stay
in
the
country
during
the
appeal.
if
i
file...
at
least
i
can't
be
certain
i
can.
if
i
file
that
motion
for
reconsideration,
that
doesn't
seem
like
a
very
good
thing.
it
seems
like
i'll
either
have
to
give
up
my
right
to
file
a
motion
for
reconsideration,
or
i'll
have
to
give
up
my
certainty
that
i
can
stay
here
until
i
get
an
appellate
court
to
look
at
this
thing.
now,
am
i
right
about
that,
and
if
i'm
right,
why
would
congress
want
to
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
assume,
just
at
this
point
you
might
answer...
i
think
justice
scalia
brought
up
the
fact
that
her
regulation
doesn't
say
anything
about
whether
or
not
reconsideration
tolls
or
makes
it
nonfinal,
and
the
regulation
is
written
in
the
same
words
as
the
hobbs
act,
as
the
administrative
procedures
act,
as
interpreted
by
this
court
to
mean
that
you
file
a
motion
for
reconsideration,
it
isn't
final
any
longer,
so
what
is
it
that
leads
you
to
say
that's
what
her
decision
is?
that
isn't
what
her
decision
says.
that
isn't
what
the
regulation
says.
rather,
it
uses
the
language
that
this
court
has
interpreted
as
meaning
what
mr.
morrison
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
not
interested...
at
the
moment
i'm
not
interested
in
the
reasonableness
of
that
interpretation,
but
is
that
the
interpretation?
look,
you
have
language
in
the
hobbs
act
which
says
an
order
when
it's
served
is
final,
okay,
it's
final
on
the
date
when
it's
served,
no
matter
whether
there's
a
petition
for
reconsideration,
and
the
court
says,
that
language
says
it's
final
when
it's
served,
but
it
isn't
final
if
you
file
a
petition
for
reconsideration.
that's
what
this
court
said,
irrespective,
and
this
court
said
it
because
the
apa
says
exactly
the
same
thing.
the
apa
says
it's
final,
no
matter
whether
there's
a
motion
for
reconsideration
or
not,
and
this
court
says
it's
long
been
held
that
you
file
a
motion
for
reconsideration,
not
final
any
more.
now
we
have
for
the
third
time
a
regulation
this
time
which
says
an
order
shall
become
final.
it
says
nothing
about
petitions
for
reconsideration,
so
why
wouldn't
this
regulation
mean
exactly
what
similar
language
means
everywhere
else
in
the
law,
namely
that
it
is
final,
but
if
you
file
a
motion
for
reconsideration,
it
doesn't
become
final.
that
i
think
is
what's
worrying
me,
and
maybe
some
others.
