justice
antonin
scalia
i
take
it--
--i
have
two
questions,
mr.
morrison.
number
1,
what
happens
if
the
petition
for
judicial
review
is
filed
first,
and
then
the
petitioner
decides,
i'll
ask
for
a
rehearing.
what
happens
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
the
statute
here...
an
option
that
the
statute
here
eliminates.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
that
they
shall
be
consolidated
in
such
a
situation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--my
second
question
is
whether
the
filing
of
the
motion
for
reconsideration
or
for
reopening
simply
tolls
the
period
for
review,
or
does
it
retroactively
render
the
decision
nonfinal
so
that
you
have
the
full
period
at
the
end
of...
once
the
petition
for
reconsideration
is
disposed
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
even...
or
for
that
matter,
even
that
the
attorney
general
intended
the
result
to
be
different.
the
language
of
the
attorney
general's
regulation
is
not
much
different
from
the
language
of
the
hobbs
act
that
we
interpreted
in
the
icc
case.
isn't
that
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
1990
amendment,
mr.
morrison?
isn't
that
a
significant
difference
between
the
statutory
scheme
here
and
the
one
involved
in
the
hobbs
act
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
it
displays
the
expectation
of
congress
that
at
least
with
enough
frequency
to
be
worth
addressing
in
the
u.s.
code
there
would
be
two
separate
appeals,
one
from
the
original
order
and
one
from
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
reconsideration?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
situation
common
enough,
however,
to
be
a
reasonable
explanation
for
the
statutory
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
can
come
up
with
a
circumstance
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
morrison,
i
want
to
come
back
to
the
1990
amendment,
the
consolidation
provision.
you
have
given
me
an
explanation
of
how
that
provision
has
meaning
with
regard
to
reopening.
how
does
it
have
meaning
with
regard
to
reconsideration,
because
it
does
say,
any
review
sought
with
respect
to
a
motion
to
reopen
or
reconsider
such
an
order
shall
be
consolidated--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
think
justice
breyer's
point
is
that
just
as
the
hobbs
act
did
not
require
it,
so
also
the
text
of
the
attorney
general's
regulations
do
not
require
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
language
is
virtually
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
brinkmann,
i'm
not...
i
guess
i
don't
have
everything
in
front
of
me,
but
it
is
not
my
impression
that
in
other
agencies
the
mere
fact
that
an
order
is
not
final
in
the
sense
that
a
petition
for
reconsideration
may
still
be
filed
prevents
that
order
from
being
enforced.
is
that
the
case
in
all
other
agencies?
i
mean,
you're
appealing
to
the
justice
department's
provision
that
says
it
can
be
enforced
at
once
as
demonstrating
that
this
is
different
from
the
normal
hobbs
act
or
the
normal
apa
situation.
is
it
the
case
that
in
other
agencies
the
orders
are
not
enforceable
as
long
as
a
petition
for
reconsideration
or
a
petition
for
reopening
can
be
filed?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wasn't
talking
about
congress'
intent.
i
was
talking
about
the
attorney
general's
intent.
i
thought
you
made
the
argument
earlier
that
the
meaning
of
the
attorney
general's
regulation
is
made
clear
by
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
allows...
that
the
regulations
make
it
clear
that
the
order
can
be
enforced
at
once,
even
though
there
may
later
be
a
motion
for
reconsideration,
and
i'm
saying
i'm
not
sure
that's
different
from
what
most
other
agencies
do,
that
even
though
a
motion
for
reconsideration
is
available,
or
a
motion
to
reopen,
the
order
is
enforceable
at
once.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
congress'
intent,
now.
i'm
talking
about
the
attorney
general's
regulations.
justice
antonin
scalia
with
language
that
is
the
same
as
the
language
in
the
hobbs
act.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
since
we
had
interpreted
this
language
not
to
do
what
she
wants
to
do,
she
might
have
used
some
different
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
it
should
have
been
changed
after
locomotive
engineers.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
something
that
it
seems
to
me
the
law
should
be
pretty
clear
about
before
somebody
gets
put
out
of
the
country
without
the
opportunity
for
judicial...
don't
you
think
it
should
be
clear,
and
no
doubt
about
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
not
regulation
language
which
reads
just
like
the
statutory
language
which
we
said
does
not
prohibit
later
seeking
of
judicial
review?
i
would
feel
very
much
snookered
if
i
were
an
immigrant
who
read
this
regulation,
read
what
the
supreme
court
said
a
similar
statute
held,
and
then
i'm
told
i
can't
go
to
court.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
the
way
a...
you
know,
an
honorable
country
should
operate.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
mr.
morrison
took
the
position
that
it
divests
the
court.
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
his
position.
no,
he
does
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
thought
we've
done
that
in
past.
i
thought
we
have
given
deference
to
agencies
in
their
determination
of
when
their
action
is
final.
