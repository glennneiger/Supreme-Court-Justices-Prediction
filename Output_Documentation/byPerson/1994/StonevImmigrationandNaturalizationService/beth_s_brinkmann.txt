ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
attorney
general
acted
well
within
the
authority
delegated
by
congress
in
establishing
the
administrative
framework
governing
deportation
proceedings.
it's
a
reasonable
interpretation
and
implementation
of
the
act,
and
it
warrants
great
deference.
the
attorney
general
struck
a
balance
between
several
competing
interests.
on
the
one
hand,
she
promulgated
regulations
providing
that
an
order...
a
deportation
order
becomes
final
upon
dismissal
of
an
appeal
by
the
board
of
immigration.
that
rule
serves
the
interest
of
finality
and
expedition.
on
the
other
hand,
she
authorized
a
narrow
avenue
of
relief
through
motions
to
reopen
or
reconsider.
those
serve
the
interests
in
fair
adjudication
and
permitting
consideration
of
information
that
arises
later.
the
attorney
general
did
not
provide
that
such
motions
affect
the
finality
of
deportation
orders.
there's
nothing
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
or
the
implementing
regulations
that
requires
the
attorney
general
to
surrender
the
finality
of
deportation
orders
as
a
condition
permitting
such
motions.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
locomotive
engineers
addressed
a
different
question.
the
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
or
not
the
hobbs
act
and
administrative
procedures
act
required
that
a
motion
to
reconsider
not
affect
the
finality
of
an
agency
order,
and
in
that
case
the
court
agreed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
those
statutes
did
not
require
that,
and
they
did
not
prevent
an
agency
from
taking
another
approach,
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
took,
in
that
motions
to
reconsider
could
affect
the
finality
and
suspend
that
finality
to
stay
the
time
for
seeking
judicial
review.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we
believe
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
believe
that
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
of
that
regulation
is
reasonable.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
or
the
regulations
that
suggest
that
the
filing
of
a
motion
undermines
that
finality.
to
the
contrary,
the
structure
of
the
regulations
bolsters
and
corroborates
the
attorney
general's
interpretation.
not
only
does
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor,
and
not
only
does
that
support
the
attorney
general's
interpretation,
there's
another
aspect
of
the
regulations
where
the
attorney
general
provides
that
an
alien
does
get
an
automatic
stay
during
an
administrative
appeal
from
the
immigration
judge
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
therefore
evidencing
that
the
attorney
general
not
providing
such
a
stay
means
that...
after
dismissal
of
an
appeal
by
the
board
means
that
that
order
is
final.
we
would
also
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
regulation
concerning
motions
to
reopen
and
reconsider
supports
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
in
that
it
requires
section
3.8
of
8
c.f.r.,
that
when
an
alien
files
a
motion
to
reopen
or
reconsider,
the
alien
must
specify
whether
that
deportation
order
is...
has
been
or
is
then
pending
judicial
review,
clearly
anticipating
that
judicial
review
may...
should
have
gone
forward
if
the
alien
was
intending
to
seek
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
language
is
8
c.f.r.
243.1,
establishing
that
a
deportation
order
becomes
final
upon
dismissal.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that
is
on
the
very
last
page
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief,
your
honor,
page
10a.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
that
establishes
that
an
order
of
deportation...
and
it's
down
to
about
the
sixth
line...
shall
become
final
upon
dismissal
of
an
appeal
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
also,
if
the
alien
waives
the
time
for
seeking
that
administrative
appeal,
or
that
time
expires,
it
becomes
final,
and
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
1105a(a)(1)
is
that
no
later
than
90
days
after
that
date
the
alien
must
seek
judicial
review.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
there
are
agency
actions
which
can
be
enforced--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--but
there's
a
difference
in
that
the
deportation
context,
and
i
think
this
is
what's
so
important
in
the
recognition
of
the
deference
and
the
delegation
of
the
authority
congress
has
given
to
the
attorney
general,
and
the
statute
directly
recognizes
this.
there's
a
unique
finality
about
deportation
orders,
because
once
they
are
enforced,
in
virtually...
in
every
case
the
issue
is
then
moot.
in
recognition
of
that
finality,
congress
provided
for
an
automatic
stay
pending
judicial
review
except
in
the
case
of
aggravated
felons,
in
fact,
but
in
the
situation
which
is
before
the
court.
at
the
same
time,
however,
your
honor,
congress
also
recognized
that
there
were
important
interests
of
recognition,
and
in
the
statute
1105a(a),
which
sets
forth
the
exceptions
to
the
hobbs
act
for
judicial
review
in
this
context,
that
provides
that
the
attorney
general
can
enforce
a
deportation
order
notwithstanding
the
availability
of
judicial
review
unless
and
until
the
alien
in
fact
files
for
judicial
review.
that's
paragraph
8
of
1105a(a).
and
also
there
are
two
other
aspects
of
1105a(a)
that
demonstrate
congress'
interest
in
expedition
of
finality.
in
subsection
(c),
congress
explained
that
after
the
enforcement
of
a
deportation
order
and
an
alien
departs,
there
is
no
further
judicial
review,
so
an
alien
can
in
fact
be
deported
before
he
seeks
judicial
review
and
there's
no
further
judicial
review
after
that,
again
demonstrating
that
congress'
intent
was
that
the
alien
should
file
a
petition
for
judicial
review
to
obtain
an
automatic
stay.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
that
the
way
which
we--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
understand,
your
honor.
i
think
what
we
rely
on
that
is
to
show
the
reasonableness
of
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
and
that
those
regulations
should
be
read
to
view
the
lack
of
an
automatic
stay
as
bolstering
her
finality
regulation
and
definition,
because
in
the
instance
when
it's
not
final,
when
there's
an
administrative
appeal
from
the
immigration
judge
to
the
board,
she
does
give
an
automatic
stay,
so
in
that
sense
i
believe
it
bolsters
the
reasonableness
of
the
finality
definition.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
we
urge
that
locomotive
engineers
held
that
the
language
of
the
hobbs
act
and
the
apa
does
not
require
that
motions
to
reconsider
not
affect
finality,
but
it
permits
an
agency
to
take
another
approach.
the
cases
cited
by
the
court
in
locomotive
engineers
themselves
recognize
that.
the
first
case
cited,
american
farm
lines,
recognized
the
fact
that
you
could
also
have
an
administrative
ruling
while
judicial
review
is
pending.
the
very
page
cited
by
the
court
in
locomotive
engineers
explains
that
the
concept
of
an
indivisible
jurisdiction
where
all
of
the
proceedings
must
be
in
one
tribunal
or
all
in
the
other
may
fit
some
statutory
schemes
but
it
doesn't
fit
this
one.
that's
what
the
court
in
american
farm
lines
said,
and
that
was
one
of
the
cases
on
which
the
court
in
locomotive
engineers
relied,
and
that's
what
we
submit
here.
this
is
a
different
context.
under
weinberger
v.
salfi
the
court
has
held
that
where
congress
does
not
define
finality
of
an
agency
order
and
delegates
authority
to
the
agency,
that
executive
official
has
it
well
within
her
power
to
define
that
finality,
and
we
submit
that's
what
the
attorney
general
has
done
here,
and
that
that
deserves
deference.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
the
attorney
general's
language
long
predated
the
opinion
in
locomotive
engineers,
and
the
as
the
court
itself--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
the
attorney
general's
whole
regulatory
framework
and
the
other
aspects
of
the
regulations
we
pointed
to
bolster
that
interpretation
of
that
plain
language.
the
court
itself
acknowledged
in
locomotive
engineers
that
the
plain
language
of
those
provisions
supports
the
position
that
we're
advocating
today.
it
simply
held
that
it
did
not
prevent
an
agency
from
taking
another
approach.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
reading
of
locomotive
engineers
puts
a
person
on
notice
that
the
federal
agency
that's
administering
the
act,
if
that
agency
has
the
authority
to
define
finality
and
the
impact
that
motions
to
reconsider
or
reopen
may
or
may
not
have,
that's
where
the
person
should
look.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
believe
that
that's
one
regulation
that
bolsters
the
reading
of
243.1.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
indicates
that
a--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it
doesn't
specify
in
so
much
words
what
the
impact...
that
a
motion
has
no
impact
on
finality.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
in
mr.
morrison's
position,
there
would
not
be--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--but
under
mr.
morrison's
interpretation
the
court
is
without
jurisdiction
to
exercise
review
over
that
petition
for
judicial
review,
and
that,
your
honor,
is
where
we
submit
that
the
alien
actually
is
caught
in
a
trap,
the
trap
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it's
the
trap
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
also
the
trap
of
forever
losing
a
right
to
judicial
review
if
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--if
he
doesn't
later
submit
yet
another
petition.
that
was
the
trap
that
a
litigant
fell
into
before
the
recent
amendment
of
the
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
4,
having...
if
an
alien
were
to
file
a
petition
for
judicial
review
based
on
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
believe
it
timely,
then
file
a
motion
to
reopen
on
another
matter,
if
that
divests
the
court
of
jurisdiction
over
the
petition
and
the
alien
doesn't
later
file
yet
another
petition,
he'll
be
forever
barred
of
judicial
review.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
believe
it's
his
position
if
the
motion
is
filed
first.
if
the
motion
is
filed
first,
there
is
no
jurisdiction.
the
courts
have,
in
fact,
continued
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
a
petition
for
review
notwithstanding
the
filing
of
a
later
motion
as
mr.
morrison
pointed
out,
but
they've
done
that
without
any
analysis.
the
ninth
circuit
in
berroteran-melendez
explained
that
that
was
the
practice
without
any
analytic
distinction
between
whether
the
motion
was
filed
before
or
after
the
petition
for
judicial
review,
but
that
was
the
approach
that
the
court
of
appeals
took.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
i
think
like
any
administration
of
an
adjudicatory
system
some
cases
take
longer,
some
cases
are
quicker.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
a
particular
obstacle
in
this
case.
i
think
it--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
priorities
perhaps
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
follows,
whether
it's
to
address
new
cases
that
come
up
as
opposed
to
frivolous
motions
to
reopen
or
reconsider,
that
may
very
well
be
a
priority
that
is
taken,
especially
in
the
sense
that
the
motions
do
not
affect
the
finality
of
the
deportation
order
and
that
judicial
review
of
that
can
then
be
proceeding.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we
believe
that
it
is
in
the
discretion
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
how
to
exercise
their
jurisdiction.
a
good
example
would
be
what
happened
in
the
litigation
of
the
voodoo
case
which
came
before
this
court.
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
over
the
petition
for
judicial
review
within
the
time
for
seeking
judicial
review,
yet
after
the
petition.
there
was
also
a
motion
to
reopen
filed.
the
administrative
process
went
ahead
and
resolved
that.
another
petition
for
judicial
review
was
filed
and
the
court
of
appeals
consolidated
those
two,
as
congress
now
instructs
all
courts
to
do.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we
believe
that
would,
if
that
was
a
judicial
imposition
of
a
requirement
on
the
agency,
that
would
run
counter
to
the
court's
reasoning
in
cases
like
darby
v.
cisneros,
where
the
court
recognized
where
the
congress
and
the
agency
have
not
imposed
an
exhaustion
requirement
it's
not
for
the
federal
courts
to
impose
that,
either.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
court
certainly
can
exercise
their
jurisdiction
on
a
case-by-case
basis
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
would
be
a
reason
to
stay
in
a
particular
case.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
i
would
imagine
in
the
real
world
a
party
would
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals
some
basis
for
staying
the
proceeding.
a
motion
for
reopening
or
reconsideration
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
that's
before
the
court
of
appeals.
for
example,
your
honor,
in
chadha,
in
cardoza-fonseca,
all
of
those
cases
involved
situations
where
there
were
changes
in
law
that
might
give
the
alien
another
avenue
for
relief
in
the
meantime
during
the
pendency
of
the
litigation,
and
the
alien
could
go
back
and
file
a
motion
to
reopen
or
reconsider
on
those
grounds.
the
court
expressly
recognized
that
did
not
moot
the
judicial
proceeding
at
that
time
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
1)
the
threshold
issue
of
deportability
would
have
to
be
resolved
in
any
event,
because
those
motions
were
based
on
requests
for
other
types
of
discretionary
relief.
also,
the
initial
relief
that
may
have
been
requested...
for
example,
asylum...
the
court
should
go
ahead
and
adjudicate
that,
because
that
may
be
a
method,
a
relief
that
is
more
advantageous.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--for
example,
in
the
case
where
an
alien
is
proceeding
through
the
court
of
appeals
on
an
asylum
request,
and
perhaps
a
legislative
change
comes
up
that
could
entitle
the
alien
to
a
lesser
form
of
relief,
adjustment
of
status
that
might
be
to
a
temporary
situation
as
in
cardoza-fonseca,
there's
no
reason
for
the...
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
will
in
no
way
be
mooted
or
affected
by
that
latter--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
congress'
intent
in
finality
and
expedition,
particularly--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
that
same
argument
could
be
made,
for
example,
for
imposing
exhaustion
requirements
on
agencies
which
the
court
in
darby
v.
cisneros
held
was
not
the
role
of
the
courts
to
impose
that
when
the
statute
and
the
agency
have
not
imposed
that.
we
believe,
again,
in
the
unique
situation
of
deportation,
where
newly
occurring
events
may
become
relevant,
the
parties
agree
that
newly
occurring
events
in
a
country
to
which
an
alien
may
be
deported
may
become
relevant,
so
there
is
always
a
potential
for
a
motion
to
reopen
or
reconsider
to
be
brought
in
the
administrative
process
at
any
time
during
the
period
of
judicial
review.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we
agree
that
there
is
this
recognition
now
in
a
statutory
framework
of
the
motions
to
reopen
and
reconsider
which
the
attorney
general
has
long
permitted.
we
maintain,
however,
that
under
the
court's
rationale
in
cases
like
foti
and
cheng
fan
kwok,
the
court
has
recognized
that
it
is
within
the
attorney
general's
authority
to
define
the
scope
of
deportation
proceedings
and,
we
would
submit,
the
scope
of
motions
to
reopen
and
reconsider,
and
the
court
has
acknowledged
that
that
may
indeed
impact
the
nature
of
judicial
review,
but
under
this
scheme,
that
is
in
the
nature
of
things
in
the
authority
that
has
been
delegated
to
the
attorney
general
to
structure
that
framework.
so
while
we
believe
that
the
statute
does
recognize
the
existence
of
motions
to
reopen
and
reconsider,
we
again
believe
that
it's
within
the...
well
within
the
attorney
general's
authority
to
structure
the
administrative
framework
to
define
finality
and
to
interpret
that
as
motions
not
affecting
that
finality.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
our
argument
certainly
doesn't
rest
on
the
authority
to
completely
abolish
those
motions,
although
there
is
no
express
requirement
of
that
in
the
statute.
but
we
do
believe,
as
in
the
situation
where...
in
foti
where
the
attorney
general
had
altered
the
administrative
scheme
to
require
that
applications
for
suspension
of
deportation
now
be
brought
into
deportation
proceedings,
that
meant
that
the
judicial
review
provisions
for
deportation
proceedings
now
were
the
sole
remedy,
the
sole
avenue
of
judicial
review
for
suspension.
in
that
same
way,
we
believe
that
it's
well
within
the
attorney
general's
discretion
to
set
the
limits
on
motions
to
reopen
and
reconsider.
thank
you,
your
honor.
