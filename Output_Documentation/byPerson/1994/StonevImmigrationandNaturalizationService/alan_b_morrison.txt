mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
march
1987,
the
respondent
here
issued
an
order
to
show
cause
to
petitioner
as
to
why
he
should
not
be
deported
from
the
united
states.
approximately
10
months
later,
after
a
hearing,
the
immigration
judge
ordered
petitioner
deported,
and
petitioner
then
filed
an
appeal
with
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
proceeding
pro
se
with
a
brief
of
approximately
13
pages.
three-and-a-half
years
later,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
affirmed
the
order
of
deportation
on
july
26,
1991,
in
a
brief
opinion
dealing
with
the
issues
presented.
less
than
a
month
later,
acting
pursuant
to
the
rules
of
the
immigration
service,
petitioner
filed
a
motion
for
reconsideration
or
reopening.
he
later
filed
a
very
short
brief,
and
the
immigration
service
attorney
filed
a
reply
in
the
middle
of
october.
there
the
matter
remained
until
the
3rd
day
of
february,
1993,
at
which
time
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
denied
the
motion
for
reconsideration
and
reopening
in
an
order
that
ran
a
page
and
a
little
bit
onto
the
second
page,
most
of
which
was
boiler
plate
response
to
the
motion.
petitioner
then
filed
a
petition
for
review
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
on
the
16th
february,
less
than
2
weeks
after
the
order
came
down.
he
filed
his
brief
shortly
thereafter,
and
the
government
filed
its
brief
in
the
end
of
april
1993,
a
lengthy
brief
of
some
33
pages,
14
of
which
dealt
with
the
merits
of
the
challenge.
in
that
brief,
the
government
said
for
the
first
time
to
petitioner,
you
are
too
late.
you
should
have
filed
your
petition
for
review
shortly
within
the
90
days
after
july
1991.
oral
argument
was
held
shortly
thereafter,
and
in
early
january
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
issued
its
ruling.
it
concluded
that
the
petition
for
review
was
timely
with
respect
to
the
denial
of
the
motion
for
reopening
or
reconsideration,
but
it
was
not
timely
with
respect
to
the
original
decision,
even
though
the
motions
were
then
pending
before
the
immigration
service.
it
agreed
with
the
government
that
the
failure
to
file
within
the
90
days
provided
by
the
statute
made
the
filing
too
late
when
it
came
in
february
1993,
and
the
question
presented
before
this
court,
on
which
the
courts
of
appeals
are
badly
divided,
is,
is
that
decision
correct?
the
government
recognizes
that
under
the
usual
rule
in
administrative
law
and
judicial
review,
that
a
timely
filed
motion
for
reconsideration
or
reopening
renders
the
decision
of
the
agency
not
final,
such
that
not
only
need
not
a
petitioner
seek
judicial
review
at
that
time,
but
the
petitioner
may
not
seek
judicial
review
at
that
time.
and
the
reason
for
that
rule
is
a
sound
one
of
judicial
economy.
the
courts
should
not
become
involved
in
deciding
cases
if
the
agency
which
has
the
matter
before
it
has
the
ability
and
the
power
and
under
its
rules
the
authority
to
reconsider
the
decision
at
that
time.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
usual
rule
is
that
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
judicial
review
takes
the
matter
into
court,
and
that
it
does
not
divest
the
agency
of
the
authority
to
reconsider,
although
it
does
not
stop
the
court
from
considering
the
matter,
and
in
that
circumstance
it
is
up
to
the
court
to
decide
whether
it
will
choose
to
proceed
with
the
case
or
allow
it
not
to
proceed.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor,
i
don't--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no.
it
only
says
they
shall
be
consolidated,
as
i
read
it,
if
there
are
two
or
more
petitions
for
review.
that
is
to
say,
it
does
not
direct
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
first
case
to
hold
it,
and
my
reading
of
the
cases
is
that
some
courts
more
or
less
automatically
hold
them
if
they
are
told.
in
some
cases
some
courts
automatically
don't
hold
them,
and
in
other
cases
they
do
what
seems
to
me
the
sensible
thing
to
do,
which
is
to
look
at
the
motion
for
reconsideration
to
see
whether
it
really
raises
some
new
issues.
for
instance,
in
the
immigration
area,
where
often
the
change
in
circumstances
of
the
country
to
which
the
alien
would
be
deported
would
be
a
very
important
element.
if
somebody
was,
for
instance,
to
be
sent
back
to
bosnia,
you
would
want
to
have
the
latest
information
on
what
the
state
of
the
world
was
in
bosnia
before
you
sent
the
particular
individual
back.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
was
simply,
you
got
it
wrong
and
you
misread
your
opinion
or
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
there
would
be
no
particular
reason
for
the
court
to
stay
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
have
not
seen
a
case
that
deals
with
that
question,
your
honor,
that
comes
up
explicitly.
it
wouldn't
matter
here
in
this
particular
case.
my
own
opinion--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
question
i
believe
justice
scalia
was
asking
me,
is
that
because
it
makes
it
a
tolling
that
you
stop
at
that
point...
suppose
they
filed
it,
as
in
this
case,
on
day
26.
they
filed
the
motion
for
reconsideration
on
day
26.
the
question
that
justice
scalia
i
believe
asked
me,
does
he...
does
the
petitioner
here
have
90
days
from
the
time
of
the
denial
of
the
motion
for
reconsideration,
or
90
minus
26,
which
i
think
is
64,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
answers
that.
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
filing
of
the
motion
for
reconsideration
renders
it
not
final.
this
would
be
analogous,
for
instance,
to
what
happens
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
where
a
filing
of
a
timely
motion
for
reconsideration
under
rule
52a
or
59
renders
the
decision
nonfinal
and
you
get
your
full
30
days
at
the
end
of
that
time.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
you
may
not
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
that
circumstance.
under
1105a(a)(10)
the
jurisdiction
under
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
is
specifically
preserved
for
that
situation,
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
where
that
arises
where
the
alien
would
then
go
to
the
district
court
where
he
would
have
to
obtain
a
stay
of
deportation,
assuming
that
the
agency
didn't
give
it
to
him.
i
might
point
out,
of
course,
two
things.
the
first
is,
we
do
not
concede
in
this
case
the
validity
of
that
regulation,
because
we
believe
that
that
regulation
depends
upon
the
authority
under
8
u.s.c.
1252c,
which
is
the
authority
to
deport,
and
it
says
there
must
be
a
final
order
of
deportation.
you
then
may
have
6
months
to
deport
the
alien.
this
case
doesn't
present
that
question,
so
we
don't
accept
the
validity
of
that
regulation,
and
since
the
phrases
are
the
same
in
both
statutes,
we
think
they
should
be
interpreted
together.
but
even
assuming
the
validity
of
the
regulation,
we
would
first
point
out
that
in
many
cases,
as
in
this
one
here,
mr.
stone
filed
his
motion
for
reconsideration
in
august
of
1991.
at
no
time
did
the
service
ever
try
to
deport
him.
indeed,
it
has
not
to
this
day
tried
to
deport
him,
even
after
it
prevailed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
so
it
is
in
some
respects
true
that
the
regulation
provides
that,
but
it
is
not
a
process
which
automatically
goes
forward.
the
statute,
indeed,
gives
the
agency
6
months
to
do
it.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
would
think
it
would
look
at
two
things,
your
honor.
first,
it
would
look
at,
as
in
any
kind
of
an
application
for
a
stay,
the
equities,
and
it
might
well
look
at
the
standard
questions
on
a
stay
such
as
the
probability
of
success.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
it's
a
little
bit
awkward.
i
would
suppose
it
would
probably
have
to
predict
it
solely
on
the
motion
for
reopening
part
of
it.
it
doesn't
happen
very
much
for
this
very
sensible
reason,
that
the
immigration
service
simply
doesn't
want
to
start
to
go
deporting
people
when
it
has
it
fully
within
its
power
to
simply
decide
these
matters.
this
case
is
not
an
unusual
one
in
which
a
motion
for
consideration
languished
for
17
months
before
the
immigration
service,
and
the
immigration
service
looks
a
little
awkward
trying
to
throw
people
out
of
the
country
before
a)
they
decide
the
case
and
b)
they
have
given
them
their
statutory
right
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
agree
that--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
agree
with
that,
and
if
they
cut
it
out
we
wouldn't
have
a
situation
like
this.
the
agency...
i
think
they
could
certainly
on
reconsideration.
on
the
reopening,
your
honor,
it
may
be
a
little
different,
because
there
are
statutory
requirements
with
regard
to
the
country
to
which
the
person
could
be
sent
and
other
kind
of
asylum
and
other
kind
of
issues,
and
it
might
have
a
lot
more
difficulty
cutting
out
reopening
in
terms
of
presenting
new
evidence.
but
obviously
neither
of
those
cases
is
before
us
today,
and
the
agency,
even
today
when
congress
told
them
in
1990
to
issue
new
regulations,
they
finally
got
around
to
proposing
them
4
years
later,
and
those
regulations
continue,
albeit
under
somewhat
different
circumstances,
the
right
to
file
for
reconsideration
and
for
reopening.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
do
you
mean--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--a
final--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--at
that
time.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
would
say
that
your
honor
is
correct
that
that
is
the
way
the
government
interprets
the
statutory
scheme.
i
would
say
that
your
honor's
analysis
gives
further
force
to
my
view
that
the
government's
view
that
it
has
the
right
to
deport
somebody
while
it
is
itself
reconsidering
the
matter
is
not
correct.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court
today,
but
it's
particularly
unreasonable
for
the
government
to
take
this
position,
because
the
regulations
on
reconsideration,
while
they
do
warn
you
that
you
can't
stay
in
the
country,
don't
also
warn
you
that
you
better
go
file
your
notice...
petition
for
review
right
away,
so
the
alien
first
learns
that...
about
this
potential
trap,
the
same
kind
of
trap
that
this
court
remarked
about
2
years
ago
in
the
darby
case.
we
have
exactly
that
trap
here.
and
we're
also
dealing
with
people
who,
by
definition,
many
of
them
are
proceeding
pro
se,
they
get
no
notice,
many
of
them
don't
speak
any
english,
if
they
have
lawyers,
the
lawyers
may
not
be
fully
familiar
with
these
difficult
matters
of
administrative
law
that
we're
dealing
with
here.
they're
basically
experts
in
the
immigration
field.
and
i
think
also
it's
fair
to
say
that
many
people
know
that
the
immigration
service
is
not
deporting
people
promptly,
even
though
their
regulations
say
they
can
do
it.
it
leads
to
the
possibility
of
selective
enforcement,
which
is
a
whole
other
set
of
problems.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
two
things
to
that.
the
first
question,
of
course,
is
not
whether,
if
we
were
designing
a
system
sitting
here,
we
would
design
the
system
that
way.
the
usual
rule
is
to
the
contrary.
that
is
to
say,
as
i
outlined
it
before,
and
as
the
icc
case
makes
it
clear,
the
usual
rule
is
to
the
contrary,
that
you
don't
burden
the
courts
with
even
having
to
deal
with
the
administra--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
it
was
the
icc's
position
because
that
was
the
way
they
could
get
the
case
thrown
out
of
court.
i
would
say
that
the
immigration
service
over
the
years
in
cases
like
foti
and
cheng
fan
kwok
took
different
positions
on
which
court
you
could
go
to
depending
on
who
was
the
winner
or
who
was
the
loser
in
a
particular
situation.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct,
and
i
say
that
first
because...
i
want
to
answer
your
honor's
question
about
why
the
system
wouldn't
make
sense.
it
would
make
sense
for
everybody
except
the
courts
of
appeals.
that
is,
the
courts
of
appeals,
the
judges
would
have
to
get
these
motions
and
sit
down
and
decide
them
regularly.
in
many
cases,
the
briefs
would
have
to
be
filed,
and
the
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
to
hold
argument
or
hold
in
abeyance,
they
would
have
to
decide
whether
to
issue
an
opinion,
which
might
end
up
being
an
advisory
opinion,
and
all
of
those
reasons
are
the
same
whether
it's
the
immigration
case
or
the
icc
or
the
nlrb,
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
in
the
absence
of
some
indication
that
congress
intended
the
result
to
be
different
in
this
case
from
others,
it
should
not
be
different.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulation
itself
that
tells
you
when
you
go
to
court.
it
tells
you
when
the
alien
can
be
deported,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
regulation,
which
is
of
course
another
problem
that
i
have
with
it.
the
government
makes
a
great
deal
of
the
fact
that
this
is
an
immigration
area
and
that
congress
was
very
worried
in
1961
when
it
passed
the
judicial
review
provision
at
issue
here
to
get
these
cases
over
with
quickly.
well,
the
one
particular
problem
that
congress
addressed
was
the
multiple
appeals.
that
is,
the
alien
going
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
deciding
it
on
the
record
and
going
to
the
court
of
appeals.
congress
said,
no,
we
don't
want
two
levels
of
appeals.
exclusive...
and
that's
the
word
in
the
statute,
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that
took
care
of
one
problem.
but
interestingly,
congress
did
not
say
anything
at
all
about
the
kind
of
speed
or
the
necessity
for
moving
the
case
ahead
the
way
the
government
suggests
here.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
hobbs
act.
in
fact,
the
hobbs
act
is
the
model,
but
ironically...
the
government
says
congress
was
concerned
about
speed.
they
gave
them
180
days
for
an
alien
to
get
to
court.
they
cut
it
back
to
90
days.
the
hobbs
act,
which
deals
with
the
icc
and
many
others,
is
only
60
days,
rather
odd
if
you
were
really
concerned
about
getting
to
court.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
must
confess,
your
honor,
when
i
looked
at
the
1990
amendment,
i
wasn't
quite
sure
what
it
was
actually
going
to
do
in
the
real
world.
my
experience
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
if
you've
got
two
cases
arising
out
of
the
same
matter,
as
this
surely
would
be,
the
court
would
inevitably
consolidate
them.
there
is
no
legislative
history
that
helps
on
this.
the
government's--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
think
that
that
is,
as
an
inference...
the
government's
position
first
is
that
under
our
view
of
the
statute
there
would
never
be
a
case
in
which
this
would
happen.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
demonstrably
false,
and
let
me
explain
why.
suppose
that
the...
mr.
stone
here
had
not
filed,
and
then...
but
had
sought
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
within
the
90
days.
six
months
later...
his
country
of
origin
is
canada,
so
it's
not
likely
to
happen,
but
let's
assume
that
something
happened
in
canada
that
made
it
very
changed
circumstances
for
him
to
go
back
there.
he
wouldn't
file
a
motion
for
reconsideration,
he
would
file
a
motion
to
reopen,
setting
forth
in
affidavits
a
new
circumstance.
for
instance,
his
family
situation
might
have
changed
here,
he
might
have
a
sick
child
in
the
united
states,
and
he
would
be
asking
for
some
form
of
discretionary
relief.
many
aliens
do
that.
they
ask
for
some
form
of
discretionary
relief
on
reopening.
if
that
were
denied,
he
would
then
seek
judicial
review
on
the
reopening
under
a
rather
different
standard
from
under
the
original
case,
just
like
in
the
icc
case.
that
is,
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion,
and
there
are
rules
of
the
ins
saying
when
they
have
to
reopen
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
what
you
have
to
put
forth.
in
that
situation,
the
1990
statute
would
come
into
play,
just
as
it
almost
certainly
would
have
come
into
play
before
1990,
so--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
can't
answer--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
can't
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
think
it's
quite
common
that
aliens
do
submit
new
information.
that
is
a
fairly
common
circumstance.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
support
it.
there
was
directed
to
be
a
study
by
the
attorney
general
afterwards,
and
i
think
there
were
some...
less
than
1,000
cases
in
which
motions
for
reopening
were
filed.
i'm
sorry
i
can't
read
the
congress'
mind
on
that.
it
certainly
is
not
an
absurd
notion
that
they
should
do
it,
and
it
was
a
notion
that
they
should
do
something
to
speed
up
the
process.
but
interestingly,
that
amendment
is
adding
a
new
section
(a)(6).
it
does
not
change
either
the
meaning
of
the
final
order
of
deportation,
or
the
90
days,
or
anything
else
in
the
language
which
we're
relying
on
here.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
subject
to
the
right
of
going
to
the
district
court
on
a
habeas
corpus
petition--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--and
i
would
argue
very
vehemently
that--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes,
your
honor,
but
one
would
be
hard-pressed
to
know
what
the
immigration
service
would
say
in
response
to
my
motion,
which
would
say,
first,
we
have
a
timely
motion
for
reconsideration
which
they
haven't
acted
on,
despite
the
many
months
it's
been
before
them,
they
want
to
deport
him,
as
soon
as
they
act
on
it
he's
going
to
file
and
go
to
court
on...
he's
going
to
go
to
court
and
get
an
automatic
stay
of
deportation.
where
do
the
equities
lie
in
that
kind
of
situation?
and
i
think,
under
those
circumstances,
most
district
judges
would
be
pretty
hard
pressed
to
say,
send
him
out
of
the
country,
he
loses
all
of
his
rights
at
that
point
regardless
of
what
the
merits
of
the
decision
are,
because
the
immigration
service
has
it
fully
within
its
power
to
correct
the
matter
as
soon
as
it
wants
to
if
it
will
only
get
around
to
deciding
these
motions
for
reopening.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
your
honor,
i
am
representing
my
client
here
today,
and
his
case
is
not--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
is--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--he
could
be
deported
if
the
service
a)...
i
don't
believe
under
the
law...
as
i
read
the
statute--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--have
to
decide,
that
is
correct.
i'd
be
more
than
happy
to
have
your
honors
decide
it
in
my
favor
on
that
issue.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is,
i
believe,
the
only
intellectually
defensible
way
that
you
can
reach
the
result
which
i'm
urging
this
court
to
reach
today,
that
my
client's
petition
for
reconsideration
stop,
whether
it's
tolled
or
made
nonfinal.
it's
the
only
way
he's
going
to
get
his
day
in
court,
and
that
is
my
obligation
to
do
it.
and
i
believe
that
aliens
will
be
adequately
protected.
i
do
not
believe
the
service
will
engage
in
wholesale
orders
of
deportation,
and
the
district
courts
would
not
stand
for
it
if
they
did,
when
it's
perfectly
within
their
power
to
see
that
people
both--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct,
unless
there
is
some
other
discretionary
form
of
relief,
which
he
may
seek
with
the
immigration
service.
as
far
as
the
court
system
is
concerned--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no,
it
would
not.
it
would
not,
your
honor,
not
unless--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--the...
well,
the
order
to
show
cause
was
in
march
1987.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
almost
8
now.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
immigration
judge
was
in
january
'88,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
was
3-1/2
years
later,
in
july
of
1991,
and
they
have
made
no
effort
to
deport
him
in
those,
whatever
number
of
years
you're
measuring
it
from,
despite
their
regulations
and
despite
what
they
say
the
statute
is,
and
i
am
very
concerned
about
this,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
what
the
right
answer
is.
it
seems
to
me
the
best
answer
is
for
the
service
to
get
off
the
dime
and
to
start
to
proceed
with
these
matters
so
that
they
can
be
taken
care
of.
i
think
that's
what
congress
wants,
and
instead
of
playing
judicial
yo-yo--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--as
your
honor
may
know,
the
service
has
no
time
limits
whatsoever
on
motions
for
either
reconsideration
or
reopening,
and
i
suppose
i
could,
if
i
were
an
attorney
in
good
faith,
say
to
the
ins,
there's
a
new
case
which
you've
decided
which
is
inconsistent
even
after
my
time
for
review
has...
i've
already
filed
my
petition
for
review.
you
treated
somebody
differently.
that's
reconsideration
as
opposed
to
reopening.
reopening
is
new
evidence.
reconsideration
is
that
you're
now
inconsistent
with
another
line
of
cases
that
you're
decided.
i'd
like
to
reserve
what
little
time
i
have
left.
thank
you.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice,
you
began
by
asking
ms.
brinkmann
what
is
it
that
we
are
being
asked
to
construe,
and
what
is
it
she's
asking
deference
to.
obviously,
the
regulations
the
attorney
general
has
issued
can
be
construed
and
she
can...
the
attorney
general
may
be
entitled
to
some
deference
as
to
what
her
regulations
mean.
i
would
agree
with
several
members
of
the
court
that
these
regulations
don't
say
what
the
government
now
says,
but
even
if
those
regulations
were
explicit,
in
the
end
we
are
construing
1105
(a)(1),
which
is
the
provision
for
judicial
review.
ms.
brinkmann
never
mentioned
the
magic
word
chevron
here
today,
but
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
chevron
deference
has
been
given
to
an
administrative
agency
to
construe
away
a
right
to
judicial
review.
the
only
case
the
government
cites
is
weinberger
v.
salfi,
and
that
case
involved
the
question
of
not
whether,
but
when.
that
is,
the
question
was
whether
the
government
could
require
you
to
take
it
later
rather
than
earlier,
a
totally
different
situation
than
what
we
have
here,
and
indeed
this
court
in
cheng
fan
kwok,
in
darby,
in
lampf,
and
in
other
cases
has
specifically
rejected
the
view
of
the
government
as
to
when
judicial
review
is
available,
because
the
whole
theory
of
chevron
is
that
you
give
review
deference
to
the
agency
in
order
for
it
to
construe
the
statute
under
which
it
is
operating.
the
"it"
here
is
the
court
of
appeals
that's
operating.
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
get
controlled
by
the
government.
after
all,
we
have
judicial
review
for
the
very
purpose
of
checking
government
action,
and
it
would
be
odd,
indeed,
for
the
congress
to
have
said,
we
will
give
the
government
deference
in
construing
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
way
that
will
adversely
affect
those
who
want
to
challenge
government
action.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
only
case
in
which
that
arises
is
weinberger
v.
salfi.
it
was
raised
by
the
court
sua
sponte.
the
government
did
not
object
to
jurisdiction,
did
not
object
and
said
that
they
did
not
oppose
the
case
coming
into
court.
no
party,
and
this
is
a
pre-chevron
case,
argued
that
the
government's
interpretation
of
finality,
which
was
what's
at
stake
there,
should
not
be
given
deference
because
the
issue
was
raised
by
the
court.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
was
interested
to
hear
her
statement
that
anyone
could
go
read
that
decision
and
understand
that
it
was
permissive.
i
read
it
the
other
way
around,
that
it
was
an
interpretation
of
the
hobbs
act
as
to
when
judicial
review
was
available
or
not
available.
in
my
view,
it
would
be
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
the
hobbs
act
and
of
the
statute
at
issue
here
to
conclude
the
opposite
of
what
i've
urged,
but
even
if
one
could
conclude
the
contrary,
it
would
not
be
because
of
the
attorney
general's
deference,
to
which
the
attorney
general
is
due.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
do
not
believe
that
that
statute
can
mean
that.
it
must
mean
it
in
light
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
establishes
the
general
rule
that
if
there
is
reconsideration
or
rehearing,
then
the
agency's
action
is
not
final,
and
that
the
agency
cannot
decide
to
the
contrary.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
thank
you,
your
honor.
