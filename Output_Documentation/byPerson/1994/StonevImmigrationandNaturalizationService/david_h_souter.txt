justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
only
specific
language,
i
take
it,
in
your
argument
that
the
attorney
general's
regulation
actually
addresses
to
this
issue
is
the
regulation
that
provides
that
when
an
appeal
is
taken
there
should
be
a
specification
as
to
whether
a
motion
for
reconsideration
or
reopening
is
pending,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
doesn't
require
it,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
we
assume
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
does
not
in
and
of
itself
answer
the
question,
and
you
then
turn
to
the
regulation
that
says
when
you
appeal
you
should
say
whether
there's
a
motion
to
reopen,
et
cetera,
pending,
you
would...
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
that
may
be
some
evidence,
but
that
is
not
an
unequivocal
statement
for
your
position.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
it
would
be...
technically
it
would
be
consistent,
it
could
be
consistent
with
mr.
morrison's
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
might
file
the
motion
for
reopening
and
say,
i
think
i'll
take
an
appeal
anyway,
and
i'm
going
to
do
it
because
i'm
afraid
the
time
may
run
against
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
trap
that
justice
breyer
described.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
loses
his
guarantee
and
his
only
hope
is
habeas,
in
that
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
he's
wrong.
