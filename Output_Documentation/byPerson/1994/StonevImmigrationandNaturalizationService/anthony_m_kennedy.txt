anthony
m.

what
is
it
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
do
under
your
view?
if
the
alien
seeks
judicial
review
of
the
bia
order
within
90
days,
and
then
files
a
motion
to
reopen
or
reconsider,
what
does
the
court
of
appeals
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
order
to
honor
the
purpose
of
the
statute
the
court
of
appeals,
since
they
can't
really
take
a
look
at
every
case
to
decide
whether
they're
going
to
act
on
it,
would
enact...
would
be
quite
within
its
powers
to
say
that
we're
not
going
to
hear
any
of
these
petitions
until
the
agency
has
acted,
in
which
case
you're
right
in
the
same
position
that
mr.
morrison's
argument
would
take
us
in
any
event.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
congress
has
a
statute
which
says
that
the
court
of
appeals
shall
consolidate,
and
if
i
were
a
judge
on
the
court
of
appeals,
i'd
say
we
have
so
many
hundreds
of
these
cases
in
the
ninth
circuit,
we
don't
have
the
resources
to
look
at
every
one
case
by
case,
we'll
simply
wait
in
order
to
comply
with
the
command
of
the
congress
that
we
consolidate
the
review,
in
which
case
you're
right
where
mr.
morrison's
position
would
put
you
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
now,
under
your
view,
the
ninth
circuit
should
do
this
before
it
orders
briefing?
a
panel
of
the
court
should
look
at
the
case
to
decide
whether
briefing
should
continue?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
does
the
court
of
appeals
know
this,
at
oral
argument
on
the
appeal
from
the
primary
decision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
decides
then
whether
or
not
it
should
stay
its
consideration?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
my
point
is,
the
court
of
appeals
won't
know
this
until
it
hears
oral
argument,
so
it
proceeds
to
the
oral
argument
stage,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
no
saving
of
resources,
which
is
what
congress
wanted
to
do
under
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
a
short
statute
that
gives
rise
to
a
long
opinion.
the
case
involves
rather
narrow
and
technical
question
but
it's
one
of
the
considerable
importance
to
aliens
who
were
been
subjected
to
the
deportation
process
and
to
their
lawyers
members
of
the
immigration
bar.
the
question
is
always
rules
to
determining
when
the
time
starts
running
on
the
90-day
appeal
period
for
review
of
the
order
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
when
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
affirms
the
deportation
or
the
alien
has
two
avenues
for
relief.
one
is
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
other
is
to
ask
the
agency
to
reconsider.
the
problem
in
this
case
arises
when
it
so
often
happens;
the
alien
exercises
his
right
to
choose
both
avenues
of
relief.
the
question
is,
does
the
filing
of
a
motion
to
reconsider,
stop
the
clock
from
running
on
the
90-day
period
for
appealing
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
various
circuits
were
divided
on
this
issue,
this
case
comes
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
judicial
circuit,
which
held
that
once
the
board
issues
the
deportation
order,
the
90-day
period
starts
to
run,
in
a
later
motion
for
reconsideration
does
not
stop
the
90-day
period
from
running
on
the
underlying
order,
we
agree
with
the
sixth
circuit.
in
an
earlier
case
from
our
court
called
locomotive
engineers
versus
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
we
explained
that
the
normal
rule
in
agency
practice
is
that
the
filing
of
a
motion
to
reconsider
makes
the
underlying
order
non-final.
so,
the
appeal
time
does
not
start
to
run
on
the
underlying
order
until
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
reconsider,
and
then
the
time
starts
to
run
on
both
orders
at
once.
the
alien
who
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case
would
like
us
to
adopt
that
rule
here.
we
decline
to
do
so,
because
in
1990
congress
enacted
the
provision
with
several
sections
designed
to
expedite
the
deportation
process
and
it
directed
that
courts
of
appeals
to
consolidate
the
appeal
from
the
underlying
order
and
the
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
reconsider,
if
both
were
pending
before
it.
and
for
reason
stated
in
the
opinion
we
conclude
that
this
provision
reflex
congress'
intent
to
depart
from
the
rule
of
locomotive
engineers
and
we
conclude
that
the
appeal
time
from
the
deportation
order
is
not
told
or
interrupted
by
the
filing
of
a
motion
to
reconsider.
thus,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
he
has
joined
in
that
opinion
by
justices
o'connor
and
souter.
