--mr.
morrison,
may
i
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
to
you?
i'm
not
sure
i'm
thoroughly
satisfied
with
your
answer
to
him.
you
in
effect
say
the
issue
of
whether
a
petition
for
reopening
stays
the
deportation
is
not
before
us.
does
that
mean
we
must
assume
for
present
purpose...
for
purposes
of
deciding
this
case
that
the
government
is
correct?
in
which
event
it
seems
to
me
the
problem
he
poses
you
haven't
answered,
namely
that
a
person
is
ordered
to
be
deported,
and
files
a
petition
for
reopening,
and
loses
the
right
to
appeal
because
it's
rendered
the
order
nonfinal,
and
may
therefore
be
deported
at
the
whim
of
the
government.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
habeas
corpus
is
not
a
guarantee--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let's
put
aside
for
a
moment
the
habeas
corpus,
because
that's
not
a
guarantee
by
any
means,
whereas
the
appeal
is
a
guarantee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
concerned
that
your
position
may
not
be
the
most
protective
of
the
immigrant.
that's
what
i'm
suggesting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
this
particular...
the
state
of,
you
know,
this
particular
record...
i'm
thinking
of
the
hypothetical
case
in
which
a
person
60
days
after
the
order
of
deportation
is
entered,
is
about
to
be
deported,
and
takes
an
appeal.
he
has
an
insurance
policy
right
now.
he
cannot
be
deported.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
view,
he
could
be
deported.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
you're
relying
on
an
issue
you
say
we
don't
have
to
decide.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
in
order
to
protect
the
people
in
this
position
we
do
not
need
to
decide
that,
and
you
say
we
don't.
so
you're
willing
to
rest
on
the
proposition,
as
i
understand
it,
that
he
would
be
subject
to
deportation
whenever
he
makes
the...
when
he
does
something
that
makes
the
deporta...
if
he...
let's
see.
i
don't
want
to
get
myself
mixed
up
here.
if
he
fails
to
appeal,
he
would
be
subject
to
deportation.
