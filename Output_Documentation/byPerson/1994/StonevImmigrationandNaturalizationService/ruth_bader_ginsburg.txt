justice
ruth
bader

mr.
morrison,
would
you
clarify
what
you
said
before?
i
thought
you
said
that
in
most...
the
normal
situation
is,
not
only
can
you
file
the
petition
for
reconsideration
first,
but
if
you
do...
if
you
do,
you
have
no
final
order
and
you
can't
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happens
if
the
attorney
general
then
says,
on
the
plane
or
on
the
ship,
out
you
go?
one
of
the
regulations
says
that
the
filing
of
an
application
for
reconsideration
does
not
stop
the
immediate
deportation
of
the
person.
suppose
you
have
filed
for
reconsideration.
you
say,
then
you
have
no
final
judgment,
you
can't
come
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
attorney
general
says,
i'm
shipping
this
person
out.
do
you
have
any
way
to
stop
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--since
you
can't
get
to
a
court
of
appeals?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
isn't
the
most
rational
thing
to
do
to
say,
file
your
notice
of
appeal
immediately,
then
you
can
file
for
reconsideration,
and
everything
is
going
forward,
leave
it
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
whether
it
wants
to
stay
the
appeal
pending
the
reconsideration
at
the
agency
level?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
the
icc's
position
in
that
case.
here,
the
attorney
general's
position,
stated
in
the
regulation,
is
the
other
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
attorney
general's
position.
it's
stated
clearly--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
if
you
just
read
the
regulations
you'd
know
what
you
have
to
do,
and
you're
saying
that
the
attorney
general
can't
have
such
a
regulation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
1)
you
infer
that
from
the
regulation
that
says
you
can
deport
the
person
immediately,
that
you
don't
have...
that
its
final...
one
thing
that
is
in
the
regulations
is
that
it's
final
for
purposes
of
putting
the
person
on
the
boat
or
the
plane.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
brinkmann,
wouldn't
it
be
just
the
court
of
appeals
would
get
an
application
to
stay
the
appeal
that's
been
filed
pending
the
resolution?
that's
the
way
these
things
come
up
in
courts
of
appeals,
don't
they?
if
there's
a
later
application
affecting
an
earlier
case,
we
rely
on
the
parties
to
apply
for
a
stay,
and
then
you
would
get
the
problem
that
mr.
morrison
brought
out
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
has
enough
business
already
having
to
deal
with
all
these
extra
stay
applications.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
wanted
to
ask
your
position
on
one
thing
that
i
think
mr.
morrison
conceded,
and
i'm
not
sure
he
did.
that
is,
the
notion
that
the
attorney
general
gave
reopenings
and
reconsiderations
and
could
do
away
with
them.
but
now
that
we
have
this
1105a
whatever,
isn't
congress
assuming
that
there
will
be
such
applications,
so
whatever
you
might
have
done
before,
congress
is
recognizing
their
existence.
how
can
you
now
take
away
the
prospect
of
reopening
or
reconsideration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
staying
with
the
position
that,
despite
congress'
recognition
that
there
are
such
things
as
reopening
applications,
that
the
attorney
general
can
say,
we're
going
to
forget
the
whole
business,
making
the
statute
addressing
nothing,
because
there's
nothing
for
it
to
address.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
morrison,
are
you
saying
that
the
hobbs
act
couldn't
be
interpreted
either
way?
i
mean,
that
was
a
case
where
the
agency
said,
when
we
reconsider,
it
makes
it
nonfinal
for
purposes
of
review.
the
icc
could
not
have
said
under
that
act,
under
our
regime
reconsideration
does
not
stop
the
finality
for
purposes
of
review?
ms.
brinkmann
kept
insist...
was
insistent
that
that
act
was
permissive,
not
mandatory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
she's
right
about
what
the
statute
means,
that
under
the
statute
an
agency
can
decide
for
itself
whether
its
application
for
reconsider
will
stay
the
finality
of
its
order
for
purposes
of
review,
if
she's
right
about
that,
then
we
do,
we
should
defer
to
the
agency's
implementation
of
the
hobbs
act,
if
it
can
be
implemented
either
way.
