we'll
hear
argument
next
in

marvin
stone
v.
the
immigration
&
naturalization
service.
mr.
morrison.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
go
to
the
district
court
on
habeas
corpus,
mr.
morrison,
what
sort
of
considerations
does
the
district
court
look
at
in
deciding
whether
to
give
a
stay
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
predicting
probability
of
success
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
right
to
rehearing
is
totally
a
creature
of
agency
regulations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
could
cut
that
out
tomorrow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
affirm
the
sixth
circuit
here,
your
client
is
on
his
way,
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
that
stay
his
deportation
further?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
was
the
original
order
to
deport
him
entered?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was,
what,
7
years
ago?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
eight.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
morrison.
ms.
brinkmann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
brinkmann,
exactly
what
interpretation
of
what
section
are
we
talking
about
when
you
say
that
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
is
entitled
to
great
deference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
243.1
on
page
10a?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
brinkmann,
i
guess
we
wouldn't
have
this
case
here
if
the
bia
had
acted
more
promptly
on
the
motion
to
reconsider
or
reopen.
why
does
it
take
18
months
to
decide
something
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
makes
it
all
the
worse,
in
a
way.
if
you
were
to
say
this
was
a
particularly
difficult
case,
or
that
a
lot
of
new
and
very
debatable
points
had
been
raised
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
or
reconsideration,
we
might
think
of
it
as
an
exception,
but
if
it's
just
routine
that
these
things
take
18
months,
not
the
original
decision
but
the
petition
for
rehearing,
i
mean,
i
think
it's
amazing,
frankly.
i
don't
know
of
any
court
in
the
country
that
takes
anywhere
near
that
long
to
pass
on
petitions
for
rehearing
after
they've
once
decided
something.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
mr.
morrison,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
morrison.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
number
93-1199,
stone
versus
immigration
naturalization
service
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
