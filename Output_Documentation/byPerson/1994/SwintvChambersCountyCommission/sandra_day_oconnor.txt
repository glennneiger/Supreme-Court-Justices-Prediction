mr.
mcduff,
could
the
district
court
judge
have
certified
an
appeal
on
this
issue
if
it
determined
that
judicial
economy
would
be
served
by
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
the
district
judge
asked
to
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wolfson,
would
the
sheriff
be
considered
a
state
officer
for
purposes
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
normally
you
would
expect,
then,
that
on
this
question
of
whether
the
sheriff
is
a
state
or
county
officer
for
purposes
of
this
suit,
that
the
result
would
be
the
same.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe...
maybe
that
applies
only
if
the
issues
are
necessarily
intertwined
or
antecedent.
i'm
not
sure
there's
any
broad
pendent
jurisdiction
at
the
appellate
level
for
an
issue
that
is
neither
intertwined
nor
antecedent,
and
i
think
the
county
sheriff
issue
is
not
in
this
case.
it's
an
independent
issue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
statutes
and
see
whether
congress
has
allowed
the
court
of
appeals
to
exercise
pendent
jurisdiction.
i
frankly
don't
see
that
authority,
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--was
the
courts
of
appeal
pretty
split
on
this
issue,
actually?
