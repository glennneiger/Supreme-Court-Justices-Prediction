we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
93-1636,
tom
swint
v.
the
chambers
county
commission.
mr.
mcduff.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcduff--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--ordinarily
we
give
great
deference
to
the
determination
of
a
court
of
appeals
that
reviews
cases
from
a
state
like
alabama
regularly
as
to
what
alabama
law
is.
you
have
a
fairly
heavy
burden,
i
think,
if
you
want
to
persuade
us
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
was
wrong
on
alabama
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
would
agree,
then,
that
whatever
the
eleventh
circuit
said,
if
the
sheriff
is
enforcing
alabama
state
law
rather
than
the
policy
of
the
county
law,
that
that
would
be
binding,
but
you
say
the
eleventh
circuit
was
wrong,
it
was
the
consequences
of
that
for
the
1983
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
it
would
be
preeminently
a
question
of
state
law
as
to
where
the
sheriff
derives
his
authority,
where
does
the
policy
come
from
that
he
enforces.
i
would
think
that
would
be
preeminently
a
question
of
state
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mcduff.
mr
wolfson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying,
then,
the
county
can...
if
the
sheriff
decides
he
wants
to
do
one
thing
that
he
thinks
the
law
requires,
can
the
board
of
supervisors
say
no,
you're
wrong
on
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
do
you
say
it's
the
policy
of
the
board
of
supervisors
that
he's
carrying
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
would
the
county
exercise
law
enforcement
authority--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--other
than
by
the
commissioners
or
by
the
sheriff?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
the...
don't
the
alabama
statutes
say
something
about
what
the
sheriff
shall
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
they
say
nothing
more
than
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
party
here
is
the
chambers
county
commission.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
under
your
theory
it's
the
county
as
an
entity,
rather
than
the
county
commission,
that
would
be
sustainable
for
liability,
and
yet
the
party
here
is
the
county
commission.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
dropped.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
mcduff,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcduff.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
93-1636
swint
against
chambers
county
commission
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
