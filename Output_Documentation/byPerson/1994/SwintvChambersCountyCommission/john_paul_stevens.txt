mr.
smith,
can
i
ask
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
policy
at
issue
is
that
in
this
county
all
raids
of
nightclubs
shall
be
conducted
by
teams
of
eight
swat
officers
dressed
in
a
certain
way
and
carrying
certain
arms.
that's
the
way
the
sheriff
says
we
will
conduct
these
raids.
who
in
the
state
can
tell
him
to
conduct
them
differently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
they'd
have
to
pass
a
statute
to
tell
him
not
to
conduct
the
raids--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
not
saying
its
legal
or
illegal,
but
the
question
is,
who
is
the
final
person
to
decide
whether
that
policy
shall
be
carried
out
in
this
particular
county?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
present
state
of
the
law,
without
any
new
legislation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
could
announce
that
policy
and
he
would
be
the
final
authority
on
the
effectuation
of
that
policy
within
the
geographic
boundaries
of
that
county.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
particular
counties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
particular
counties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
can
they
make
rules
for
the
county
that
are
different
from
the
rules
in
other
parts
of
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
saying
the
sheriff
is
a
state
official
who
sets
the
law
enforcement
policy
within
the
particular
county.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
supervision
is
there
at
the
state
level
of
the
particular
policy
involved
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
governor
tell
him
to
use
nine
officers
instead
of
eight?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
final
authority
on
that
is
the
sheriff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
final
authority
on
that
is
the
sheriff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
a
matter
of
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
a
classic
case
for
1292(b),
because
it's
a
different
party,
and
it...
isn't
it
really?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
the
precise
case
that
1292(b)
was
designed
to
provide
a
solution
for?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
argues
to
the
contrary,
it
seems
to
me,
because
you're
bypassing
those
standards.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we're
not
criticizing
it.
it's
a
question
of
power,
and
i
mean--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--either
they're
right
or
they're
wrong,
and
we
have
to
decide
it
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
statute
says
it's
an
appeal
from
a
decision.
as
in
the
stanley
case,
it's
an
appeal
from
an
order,
and
the
decision
describes
a
particular
aspect
of
the
case.
namely,
they
decided
there's
no
immunity
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
cases
under
1292(a)
where
a
party
who
could
not
have
appealed
is
allowed
to
appeal
because
another
party
appealed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
what
we
have
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
the
county
be
an
appellee,
just
because
it's
a
party
to
the
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
so
clear
we
should
have
denied
cert,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
so
clear
we
should
have
denied
cert,
i
suppose.
