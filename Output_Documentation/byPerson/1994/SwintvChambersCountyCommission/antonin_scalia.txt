justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mcduff,
it
must
be
hard
to
argue
a
case
where
your
opponent
has
not
disagreed
with
you
on
the
issue--
[laughter]
--so
you
don't
know
what
questions
you're
going
to
get,
so
i
apologize
for
giving
you
this
one,
but
we
have
held
in
the
united
states
v.
stanley
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
pendent
appellate
jurisdiction
where
the
appeal...
the
reason
the
case
is
before
the
appellate
court
is
section
1292(b),
a
certified
question
from
the
lower
court.
why
should
it
be
any
different
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
sure
it
does,
but
the
basic
reason
why
you
assert
pendent
jurisdiction
exists
under
1291
is
exactly
the
same.
what
the
heck,
we're
up
here,
we
may
as
well
make
a
clean
sweep
of
it
and
get
rid
of
everything
that
needs
to
be
decided.
that
same
reason
would
apply
in
certified
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
make
that
argument.
the
argument
i
would
have
made...
would
make
is
that
you
don't
need
pendent
jurisdiction,
because
to
the
extent
it
is
really
efficient
to
dispose
of
these
other
issues,
you
could
resort
to
1292(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
have
a
lower
court
ask
for
them
to
be
resolved,
but
if
he
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
although
you
are
aiding
and
abetting
him.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
there
were
holdings
to
that
effect
in
the
eleventh
circuit.
i
thought
there
were
holdings
to
that
effect
and
not
just
passing
statements.
justice
antonin
scalia
couldn't
state
officers
also
be
elected
by
subunits
of
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
fact
that
he's
elected
by
the
county
doesn't
necessarily
show
that
he's
not
a
state
officer.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
so
does
a
prosecutor.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
a
federal
prosecutor
doesn't
normally--
justice
antonin
scalia
--smilingly,
as...
i
mean,
i
assume
they
have
an
enormous
amount
of
independence.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wolfson,
you're
assuming
a
dichotomy.
is
it
necessarily
true
that
the
officer
is
either
a
state
officer
or,
if
not
a
state
officer,
a
county
officer
which
renders
the
county
liable
for
him
under
1983?
might
there
not
be
many
officers
who
are
not
state
officers
but
nonetheless
for
which
the
county
is
not
responsible
under
1983
because
it
cannot
control
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
the
body
corporate
that's
being
sued
under
1983,
and
that's
the
whole
assumption
of
1983,
isn't
it,
that
you're
dealing
with
something
like
a
corporation?
justice
antonin
scalia
nonetheless--
--the
case
was
before
the
court,
not
just
an
issue.
the
whole
case
was
before
the
court.
there
hadn't
been
a
final
judgment.
the
case
was
done
with,
and
all
that
that
doctrine
said
was
that
when
you
have
the
whole
case
here
you're
not
limited
to
deciding
that
single
federal
question.
it
seems
to
me
quite
a
different--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
smith,
you've
mentioned
1292(a)
several
times.
i
was
under
the
same
impression
that
justice
o'connor
is,
that
the
cases
that
allow
other
issues
to
be
brought
up
under
1291(a)
allow
to
be
brought
up
only
those
issues
that
are
necessarily
involved
in
the
issue
that
comes
before
the
court.
for
example,
in
every
injunction
case
there's
the
question
of
the
probability
of
success
on
the
merits,
and
therefore
you
have
to
take
that
up
in
determining
whether
the
injunction
was
probably
issued...
properly
issued.
are
you
aware
of
any
cases
that
do
not
establish
that
as
a
criterion
for
bringing
up
a
pendant
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
to
some
extent
that
merits
question
is
necessarily
reached,
to
some
extent
at
least.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
puzzled
by
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
questions,
which
seem
to
accept
a
dichotomy
between
state
official
and
county
official.
aren't
there
various...
doesn't
it
depend
on
what
you
mean
by
county
official?
aren't
there
county
officials
who
are
accountable
to
and
within
the
control
of
the
organ
of
the
county
commissioners,
and
other
officials
who
could
be
called
county
officials...
they
have
county-wide
jurisdiction,
elected
by
the
voters
of
the
county.
couldn't
they
be
county
officials
without
necessarily
being
within
the
control
and
therefore
responsibility
of
the
county
commissioners?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
corporation.
justice
antonin
scalia
or,
indeed,
why
we
would
be
biased
in
that
direction
as
well,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
buys
the
sheriff's
patrol
cars?
