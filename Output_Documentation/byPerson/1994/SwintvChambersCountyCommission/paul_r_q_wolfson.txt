mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
dispute
between
the
parties
on
the
merits
is
whether
the
sheriff
of
chambers
county
acted
with
the
authority
of
that
county
when
he
made
the
decisions
that
led
to
the
alleged
constitutional
violations
in
this
case.
now,
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
because
it
looked
to
the
label
that
was
placed
on
the
sheriff
by
the
state
rather
than
to
the
nature
of
the
authority
that
he
exercised,
and
the
court
has
made
clear
that
the
courts,
when
they
determined
who
is
a
final
policymaker
for
purposes
of
section
1983,
must
examine
all
of
the
relevant
legal
materials,
including
all
the
positive
law,
as
well
as
the
custom
and
usage,
and
although
section
1983
was
not
intended
to
bring
the
states
into
federal
court,
nevertheless
that
when
the
sheriff
makes
decisions
and
acts
with
the
authority
of
the
county,
he
may
subject
that
county
to
liability
under
section
1983.
in
our
view,
examining
all
of
the
relevant
legal
materials
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
district
court
properly
denied
summary
judgment
to
the
county,
because
it
does
appear
that
in
the
area
of
law
enforcement
the
sheriff
of
chambers
county
exercises
county
authority
for
which...
and
his
decisions
are
county
policies
for
which
the
county
may
be
held
liable,
and
we
look
to
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--my
understanding
is
that
the
board
of...
the
county
commissioners
do
not
exercise
supervisory
authority
over
the
sheriff,
but...
and
the
court--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--no,
our...
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondent
make
this
mistake.
they
confuse
the
power
of
the
county
commission
with
the
authority
of
the
county.
and
in
our
view
the
sheriff...
the
situation
in
chambers
county
is
a
familiar
one
of
separation
of
powers,
where
the
sheriff
has
the
power
over
law
enforcement,
and
he
has
the
final
policymaking
authority
in
that
area,
the
county
commission
has
the
power
of
the
purse
and
various
other
powers
that
county
commissions
have,
and
they
have
final
policymaking
authority
in
that
area.
and
there
are
other...
there
are
other
officers
in
chambers
county
who
are
similar
to
the
county
sheriff.
there's
the
county
tax
assessor,
there's
the
county
tax
collector,
the
county
coroner.
all
of
these
county
officers
are
directly
accountable
to
the
people,
and
they
exercise
county
authority
even
though
they
may
not
be
accountable
to
the
board
of
supervisors
and
the
board
of
commissioners
in
a
direct
way.
so
i
think
on
that
point
the
way
that
the...
the
error
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
was
saying
that
because
the
county
commissioners
could
not
exercise
law
enforcement
authority,
that
also
meant
that
the
county
could
not.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it's--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--our
view
is
it's
the
sheriff
that
exercises
law
enforcement
authority
for
the
county.
he's
elected
by
the
people
of
the
county
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
the
law
within
the
county
and
apprehension
of
suspects
within
the
county.
and
we
look
for
similar
analysis...
actually,
we
look
to
the
court's
decision
in
prapotnik
and
also
in
pembaur,
and
in
prapotnik
in
particular,
the
court
seemed
to
indicate
that
it
understood
that
separation
of
powers
was
quite
common
in
local
governments,
and
in
that
case
the
court
noted
that
the
county...
the
city
of
st.
louis's,
rather,
personnel
policies
could
be
exercised
either
by
the
mayor
or
aldermen,
or
by
an
independent
civil
service
commission,
or
by
the
two
acting
in
some
combination.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
would
say
this,
there...
what
we
looked--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
would
say
this,
these
factors:
first,
he's
elected
by
the
county
for
the
purpose
of
exercising
authority
within
the
county,
so
he's
not
like
a
state
legislator
who
is
sent
to
the
state
capital,
so
he
is
exercising
final
policymaking
authority
within
the
county.
now,
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
he
does
not
follow
any
dictates
of
a
higher
authority,
be
it
within
the
county
or
within
the
state.
he
doesn't
look
to
guidelines
issued
by
the
attorney
general
of
alabama,
or
by--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes.
the
alabama
statutes
say
that
the
sheriff
essentially
has
the
power
to
exercise
law
enforcement
in
the
county,
and
also--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
they
say...
they
say
a
number
of
things.
they
say
that...
our
reading
of
them
is
they
say
no
other
sheriff
from
outside
the
county
has
any
power,
and
there's
no
indication
that
the
sheriff
follows...
that
the
sheriff
looks
to
anybody
in
montgomery.
in
other
words,
he's
not
within
a
hierarchical
command
structure
set
up
by
the
state.
he
really
is...
he
has
the
final
say
over
law
enforcement
authority
within
the
county.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
actually--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
federal
prosecutors
are
subject,
of
course,
to
the
command
structure
of
the
department
of
justice,
i
might
refer
to
it...
as
i
might
refer
to
it,
and
actually
in
alabama
county--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
but
as
a
legal
matter
the
governor
of
alabama
cannot
remove
a
sheriff
of
chambers
county.
now,
the
sheriff
of
chambers
county
may
be
removed
by
the
voters
at
the
next
election
if
he
doesn't
exercise
law
enforcement
authority
properly,
or
if
he...
indeed,
if
he
takes
an
unconstitutional
action
which
the
result
is
to
visit
liability
on
the
county.
the
voters
may
disagree
with
that,
and
in
owen
v.
city
of
independence,
the
court
said
that's
an
appropriate
reason
to
visit
liability
on
the
county,
and
that
county
policymakers
should
consider
that,
but
there
isn't...
there
is
nobody
in
montgomery
who
is
watching
over
the
sheriff
except
a
very
limited
power,
the
power
of
impeachment,
which
is
a
criminal
proceeding
where--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
those
three
factors
are
enough
if
there
is
nothing
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
that
says
that
he
must
follow
higher
authority
from
the
state.
there
are
county...
there
are
some
forms
of
county
structures,
state
governing
structures
where
people
are
elected
by
the
county
but
where
they
implement
state
policy
under
detailed
procedures
and
guidelines.
in
alabama,
for
example,
county...
the
county
prosecutors
are
subject
to
written
circulars
of
instruction,
as
i
understand
it,
from
the
attorney
general,
so
even
though
they
may
be
elected
from
the
county
they
are
constrained
in
the
exercise
of
their
discretion,
as
i
understand
it,
by
higher
authority,
but
that
is,
as
i
understand
it,
completely
absent
in
this
case,
and
there
is
essentially
nobody
to
review
what
the
sheriff
of
chambers
county
does.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
we
agree
with
what
petitioner
said
on
that
point.
we
recognize
that
there
are
eleventh
circuit
decisions
at
least
indicating
that
sheriffs
sued
in
their
official
capacity
are
entitled
to
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
would...
i
think
that
decision
was
incorrect
by
the
district
court.
i
would
rely
on
brandon
v.
holt
for
that,
where
the
court
said
suing
a
governmental
official
in
his
or
her
official
capacity
is
really
a
pleading
device
that
brings
in
the
entity
that
he
or
she
acts
for.
i
think
when
the
sheriff
was
sued
in
his
official
capacity,
the
question
is,
well...
the
question
was,
in
which
capacity
and
that
in
some
sense
is
before
the
court
today,
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well
i...
counties,
as
i
tried
to
make
the
point
earlier,
here
it's
not
that...
the
county
can
control
the
sheriff.
the
county
is
the
electorate.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
actually,
alabama
law,
as
i
understand
it,
refers
to
the
county
as
the
body
corporate
and
politic,
not
the
county
commission,
but--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
recognize
that.
i
would
make
two
points
in
response
to
that.
first
of
all,
we
think
that
when
the
petitioners
sued
the
sheriff
in
his
official
capacity,
that
was
in
effect
naming
the
county
as
a
party
defendant,
and
it's
true
he
was
dismissed,
but
i
think
brandon
v.
holt
compels
that
conclusion.
second,
as
we
understand
it,
the
reason
why
the
chambers
county
commission
was
sued
was
they
have
the
power
of
the
purse
and
i
would
have
to
defer
to
the
other
people
who
will
be
arguing,
but
my
understanding
is
that
the
county
is
probably
not
a
necessary
and
indispensable
party
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
county
was
sued
when
the
sheriff
was
named
in
his
official
capacity.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it's--
