mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
the
merits,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
counties
in
alabama
are
liable
for
the
unconstitutional
actions
of
their
sheriffs
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983.
in
terms
of
jurisdiction,
which
i
propose
to
discuss
first,
the
question
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
authority,
by
the
virtue
of
what
it
called
discretionary
pendent
appellate
jurisdiction,
to
resolve
the
county
liability
issue
in
the
first
place
on
an
interlocutory
appeal.
let
me
state
at
the
outset
that,
because
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
the
merits,
we
would
be
pleased
if
its
opinion
were
vacated
one
way
or
the
other,
but
of
the
alternatives,
we
take
the
opposition
that
the
case
should
be
resolved
on
the
merits.
we
agree
with
our
opponents,
who
asked
the
eleventh
circuit
to
address
this
matter
in
the
first
place,
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
power
to
resolve
the
county
liability
issue
coming
as
it
did
in
the
context
of
an
otherwise
valid
interlocutory
appeal
on
qualified
immunity
grounds,
and
with
the
trial
already
on
hold
in
the
district
court
until
the
appeal
was
completed.
we
disagree
with
our
opponents
when
they
contend
that
the
county
liability
issue
is
independently
appealable
as
a
collateral
order.
as
far
as
back
as
owen
v.
city
of
independence
in
1980,
this
court
has
stressed
that
local
governments
are
not
cloaked
with
common
law
or
federal
constitutional
statutory
immunities,
and
those
are
the
sorts
of
immunities
that
give
rise
to
collateral
order
appealability
in
section
1983
cases.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes.
yes,
he
certainly
could
have.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
no.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
and
i...
i
guess
my
opponents
can
speak
to
this
better
than
i,
but
i
assume
he
was
not
asked
because,
under
existing
eleventh
circuit
case
law,
the
court
of
appeals
had
discretionary
pendent
review,
and
there
was
no
need
to
take
the
district
judge's
time
with
a
request
for
certification.
certainly,
if
it
had
been
done,
we
wouldn't
have
this
issue
today,
and
i
do
want
to
suggest
that--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
under
our
view,
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
because
i
think
the
situation
in
1367
is
very
different,
because
there
you're
talking
about
parties
who
are
not...
who
at
least
prior
to
1367
were
viewed
by
this
court
in
the
findley
case
as
not
even
being
properly
in
federal
court.
and
i
think
that's
very
different
than
a
situation
where
everyone
is
properly
in
the
federal
case,
and
the
only
question
is
whether
the
issue
and
the
parties
should
be
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
a
construction
of
pendent
appellate
jurisdiction
where
the
court
of
appeals
could
review
pendent
claims
of
the
party
that
had
the
right
to
bring
the
interlocutory
appeal
in
the
first
place
but
could
not
review
claims
brought
by
other
parties
in
the
same
case,
even
though
everyone
was
properly
in
federal
court.
so
i
think
there
are
two
very
different
situations
between
the
one
encompassed
by
1367
and
the
issue
we
have
here.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
because
i
think
1292(b)
is
a
very
different...
well,
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
i
think
1291
is
a
much
broader
statute
and
has
been
interpreted
much
more
broadly
than
1292(b).
1292(b)
is
guided
by
very
specific
factors,
and
has
a
very
specific
procedure
where
both
the
district
judge
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
to
approve
an
interlocutory
appeal
of
an
issue.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
but
in
a
certified
question,
there
is
not
a
preexisting
appeal.
in
other
words,
the
whole
interlocutory
appeal
process
starts
anew
with
someone
going
to
the
district
judge
and
saying
we
want
to
take
this
issue
up,
and
i
think
that
is
a
much
narrower
and
much
more
focused
situation
than
here,
1291,
which
is
a
broad
jurisdictional
statute,
and
where
an
appeal
already
exists.
i
mean,
for
example,
you
could
say
that
1292(b),
now
that
it
has
been
passed
and
enacted
and
used,
precludes
the
need
for
collateral
order
jurisdiction
under
1291,
and
that
we
no
longer
need
to
have
this
whole
notion
of
collateral
orders
under
1291
because
you
can
achieve
it
under
1292(b),
but
collateral
order
jurisdiction
has
not
been
jettisoned
because...
i
think
because
1291
is
a
much
broader
statute.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
but
it
seems
to--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--it
seems
to
us
to
be
rather
strange
to
have
the
notion
of
under
1291
an
appeal
that
already
is
validly
before
the
court
of
appeals...
that
is,
the
qualified
immunity
appeal
in
this
case...
yet
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
have
the
permission,
in
effect,
of
the
district
judge
in
order
to
consider
any
other
issues
in
the
case.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
we've
got
three
answers
to
abney,
and
let
me,
if
i
can,
spin
them
out
very
quickly.
i
mean,
first
of
all
we
believe
abney
can
be
read
as
this
court
exercising
its
supervisory
jurisdiction
over
the
courts
of
appeals,
saying
you
should
not
consider
pendent
claims
in
criminal
cases.
second,
and
fall-back
from
that
is
that
abney
can
be
read
as
a...
if
it's
read
as
a
jurisdictional
limitation,
it
applies
only
to
criminal
cases
in
light
of
this
court's
statement
in
several
cases
that
the
final
judgment
rule
should
be
enforced
more
strictly
in
criminal
than
in
civil
cases.
and
then
third,
if
abney
is
read
as
jurisdictional,
and
it
is
read
to
cover
civil
and
criminal
cases,
we
believe
it
is
in
conflict
with
earlier
decisions,
such
as
the
isen
case
and
the
stude
case,
and
that
abney
doesn't
comport
with
the
broad
spirit
of
1291,
and
if
necessary
should
be
overruled
to
that
extent.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
point
earlier,
and
i
see
it
now.
frankly,
i
don't
think...
i
think
it's
there
to
say
that
congress
has
probably
not
considered
this
situation
in
the
same
way
that
it
had
not
considered
collateral
order
appeals
when
cohen
came
out
in
1949,
and--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--but
abney
does
not
contain
a
very
thorough
discussion
of
this
issue.
i
mean,
all
abney
says
is
the
defendant
tried
to
bring
up
the
pendent
claim,
this
is
a
criminal
case,
and
you
know,
we
don't
want
to
encourage
this
sort
of
delay
in
criminal
cases,
and
then
there's
a
sentence
at
the
end
saying,
therefore
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction.
i
do
think
it's...
the
discussion
was
so
limited
that
i
don't
think
as
a
practical
matter
the
members
of
congress
thinking
about
the
final
judgment
rule
and
how
1291
is
going
on
into
the
future
were
really
thinking
about
that,
and
so
i
don't
think
that
is
an
assumption
that
should
guide
this
court.
i
think
instead
the
court
should
look
at
this
the
way
it
has
interpreted
1291
in
the
past,
whether
it's
with
a
final
judgment
rule
or
other
rules,
in
a
very
broad
way,
in
a
way
that
will
achieve
the
purposes
of
the...
of
1291,
which
are
the
limiting
of
piecemeal
appeals
and
the
limiting
of
effective
administration
of
justice,
and
another
example
i
want
to
give
is...
is
the
final
judgment
merger
rule,
which
of
course
has
been
around
for
a
long
time,
and
we
refer
to
this
at
page
19
of
our
supplemental
brief.
under
the
final
judgment
rule
as
applied
in
section
1291,
once
there
is
a
"final
decision"...
that
is,
a
final
judgment...
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
authority
to
review
all
prior
interlocutory
decisions
in
the
case,
even
if
they
could
not
normally
be
thought
of
as
final
decisions.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
very
well.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
we
were
forced
to.
we
were
drug
along.
in
terms
of
the
merits,
the
eleventh
circuit
in
this
case
never
disputed
the
fact
that
the
sheriff's
authority
to
set
law
enforcement
policy
within
his
or
her
county
is
final
and
unreviewable.
however,
the
court
said
it's
not
the
county's
policy
that
the
sheriff
is
setting.
the
court
of
appeals
never
said
for
whom...
for
which
unit
of
government
the
sheriff
sets
policy
but
the
only
alternative
i
think
would
be
the
state,
and
that's
what
our
opponents
contend.
but
in
looking
at
alabama
law,
three
factors
stand
out
and
together
demonstrate
in
our
view--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't...
we
don't
say
that
they
were
wrong
in
saying
what
alabama
law
means
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
but
we
are
saying,
given
what
alabama
law
is
and
what
the
eleventh
circuit
said
it
is,
it
has
a
different
result
in
terms
of
the
federal
law
than
the
eleventh
circuit
said
it
did.
i
mean,
the
question
of
what
does
state
law
mean,
and
what
are
the
parallel
relationships
in
state
law,
that
is
a
state
law
question,
but
given
state
law,
the
next
question
is,
does
that
mean
that
as
a
matter
of
section
1983
a
particular
official
sets
final
policy.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
no,
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
i
think
where
the
eleventh
circuit
says
that
the
sheriff
is
enforcing
state
policy
rather
than
county
policy,
we
do
dispute
that,
and
i
don't
think
they're
entitled
to
any
deference
on
that.
i
don't
think
that
is
an
interpretation
at
state
law.
that
is
a
conclusion.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i
think...
we
perceive
that
as
a
conclusion
that
the
eleventh
circuit
drew
from
the
givens
of
alabama
law.
the
fact
that
the
sheriff
has
final
and
unreviewable
authority
within
the
county
and
not
outside
the
county,
that's
a
state
law
question.
the
eleventh
circuit
never
disputed
that.
the
fact
that
the
sheriff
is
elected
by
the
voters
of
the
county,
state
law
question.
the
fact
that
the
sheriff's
office
is
funded
by
the
county
commission,
state
law
question.
where
the
dispute
comes
is,
given
those
factors
of
state
law,
what
does
that
mean
in
terms
of
federal
law,
in
terms
of
section
1983,
as
to
the
question
for
which
body
the
sheriff
sets
policy
and
which
body
is
therefore
going
to
be
held
liable
for
the
actions
of
the
sheriff?
we
think
that's
a
federal
law
question
and
the
eleventh
circuit
was
just
wrong
on
it.
the--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--well,
that's
what
the
district
court
actually
said
in
an
early
order
in
this
case
when
it
dismissed
the
sheriff
in
his
official
capacity.
we
disagree
with
that,
and
there's
a
footnote
in
parker
v.
williams
in
the
eleventh
circuit
where
they
discuss
this
issue,
and
they
say
pretty
much
the
same
thing.
they
say,
if
the
sheriff
is
being
sued
as
a
representative
of
the
state,
he
has
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
the
only
one
i'm
aware
of
is...
and
this
is
the
one
that
pertains
to
alabama...
is
the
one
in
parker
v.
williams,
and
at
the
end
of
that
footnote
the
eleventh
circuit
says,
now,
to
the
extent
the
sheriff
is
being
sued
in
his
official
capacity
as
a
representative
of
the
county,
we
don't
need
to
pass
on
that
because
the
county
is
a
defendant
in
parker
v.
williams
anyway.
so
although
the
eleventh
circuit
sort
of
held
that
he
was
protected
by
the
eleventh
amendment
in
his
official
capacity,
they
seemed
to
have
maybe
an
escape
valve
from
that,
if
when
one
sues
the
sheriff
in
his
or
her
official
capacity
you're
talking
about
a
suit
against
the
county
and
a
suit
against
the
sheriff
as
a
representative
of
the
county.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
first,
on...
let
me
respond
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
whether
there
are
any
cases
with
pendant
parties
bringing
otherwise
nonappealable
claims
along
with
an
appealable
claim,
and
we
cite
in
our
brief
the
1954
case
in
chicago
and
rock
island
railroad
v.
stude,
where
it
was
a
cross-appeal
that
the
supreme
court
said
should
be...
was
properly
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
along
with
the
originally
appealable
appeal
by
the
cross-parties.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
same
people.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
in
this
court
where
there
was
a
third
party
who
came
in,
but
i
think
the
point
is
well
made
by
stude
that
the
nonappealable
claim
was
brought
there
and
considered
by
a
party
that
did
not
have
an
original
right
to
appeal
at
that
point,
and
even
though
it
was
a
cross-appeal,
we
still
see
that
as
a
sort
of
pendant
party
thing
that
allows
nonappealable
claims
to
be
brought
by
parties
who
otherwise
don't
have
the
right
to
appeal.
and
also,
in
terms
of
the
court
of
appeals,
at
page
12
and
13
of
our
supplemental
brief
we
cite
some
court
of
appeals
cases,
and
of
course
there's
some
eleventh
circuit
cases
where
a
third
party
came
in.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
well,
that
may
certainly
be
the
case,
or
looking
at
the
case
once
they
have
it,
they
see
that
the
litigation
can
be
advanced
by
taking
and
reviewing
additional
issues.
on
the
eleventh
amendment
point--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--justice
scalia,
you
asked
me
earlier
about
the
eleventh
amendment
case
law...
i
mean,
the
eleventh
circuit
case
law
regarding
the
eleventh
amendment
status
of
a
sheriff's
suit
in
an
official
capacity.
there
are
some
alabama
cases
after
parker
v.
williams
that
repeat
the
point
in
the
parker
v.
williams
footnote
saying
that
sheriffs
should
be
considered
state
officials
for
purposes
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
our
view
is
that
they
are
all
a
misconstruction
of
what
parker
v.
williams
said.
and
let
me
say,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
here,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
alabama
statutes,
about
who
will
pay
a
judgment
against
the
sheriff
under
section
1983.
there's
nothing
to
say
it's
going
to
be
paid
by
the
state.
our
view,
and
this
is
from...
i
mean,
our
experience
from
outside
the
record
is
it's
actually
paid
by
an
insurance
policy
from
an
association
of
county
commissions,
but
at
any
rate,
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
we
do
not
think
has
been
properly
determined
by
any
court.
we
think
the
eleventh
circuit's
been
wrong,
and
if
it
becomes
necessary
in
this
case,
we
will
certainly
challenge
it.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
the
county
commission.
now,
in
terms
of
the
label,
my
opponent
says
that
alabama
law
labels
the
sheriff
as
a
state
official.
the
only
label
they're
talking
about
is
section
112
of
the
constitution
that
says,
"the
executive
department
shall
consist
of
a
governor
and
some
other
officers
and
a
sheriff
for
each
county.
"
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
posed
by
section
1983
of
for
which
body,
for
which
governmental
unit
does
the
sheriff
set
policy.
even
if
alabama
passed
a
statute
and
said,
the
sheriff
sets
law
enforcement
policy
for
the
state,
that
label
wouldn't
answer
the
question,
either.
you'd
have
to
look
at
the
functions
as
set
up
by
state
law,
and
if
usage
is
any
different
from
state
law,
you
look
at
that.
in
terms
of
labels,
there
are
several
statutes
that
refer
to
the
sheriff
as
a
county
officer.
one
of
them
is
cited
in...
thank
you.
