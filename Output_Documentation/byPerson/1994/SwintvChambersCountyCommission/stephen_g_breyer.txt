justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
a
list,
say,
here,
of...
there
are
two
things.
as
you
see
the
case
on
the
merits--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
always
possible
we'll
get
to
the
merits.
if
we
do--
[laughter]
--as
you
see
it
he's
either
a
state
official
or
a
county
official.
if
he's
a
state
official,
you
win.
if
he's
a
county
official,
do
you
lose,
or
is
there
some
other
theory
distinguishing
between
county
commissioners
and
county
something
else,
and
county
this,
and
county
that?
as
i
understand
your
argument,
if
he's
a
county
official,
you
lose.
do
i
have
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then...
and
then
if
he's
a
county
official,
the
county
commissioners
have
to
pay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
then
that's
how
you're
arguing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
wanted
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
he's
a
state
official,
you
win.
i've
got
that.
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
it's
a
yes--
[laughter]
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
course.
i
accept
that.
now
what
i
have
here
is,
i
have
two
lists,
and
i
want
to
be
sure
they're
complete.
the
main
thing
that
i
have
in
arguing
for
his
being
a
county
official
is,
he's
elected
by
the
county,
salary
is
paid,
the
expenses
of
the
office
are
paid,
and
his
jurisdiction
is
primarily
county.
okay.
i
have
in
favor
of
his
being
a
state
that
there's
a
document
somewhere
in
the
state
that
says
a
state,
like
a
statute
or
something,
or
a
regulation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
right--
[laughter]
--and
that's
important.
i
don't
mean
to
trivialize
it.
that
is
important.
and
the
second
thing
is,
he
could
be
impeached
by...
he
could
be
impeached
by
state
level,
and
the
third
thing
is
there's
some
eleventh
amendment
cases.
now,
i
want
you
to
do...
add...
i'm
asking
because
i
want
to
know
is
there
a
fourth,
fifth,
and
sixth
thing
i
should
put
on
that
list?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good.
