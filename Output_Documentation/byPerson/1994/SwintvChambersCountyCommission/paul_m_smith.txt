mr.
paul
m.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
on
the
merits
in
this
case
is
that
a
county
government
cannot
be
held
liable
under
section
1983
based
on
the
actions
of
an
official
like
the
sheriff
in
chambers
county,
who
is
properly
treated
as
a
state
official
both
under
state
law
and
for
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
who
operates
entirely
free
of
control
by
the
county
commission.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
if
the
county
commissioners
make
law
enforcement
policy,
the
county
is
clearly
responsible
for
any
actions
by
the
county
commission,
because
the
county
commission
is
the
governing
body
of
the
corporation,
which
is
chambers
county.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it
is
conceivable
that
state
law
could
establish
an
independent,
autonomous
municipal
official
who
has
authority
to
make
policy
for
the
municipal
corporation.
this
is
not
this
case.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
absolutely--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--if
state
law
said
that
sheriffs
are
county
officials
with
policymaking
authority
over
law
enforcement.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
i
think
there's
two
levels
of
inquiry,
your
honor.
i
think
first
you
have
to
look
at
whether
or
not
the
sheriff
is
a
state
official
or
a
county
official.
at
that
point,
i
think
if
you
determine
he's
a
state
official,
it
is
conceivable
that
there
might
be
some
areas
of
his
activity
where
he
works
under
the
control
and
effectively
is
deputized
to
the
county
commission,
and
that's
why
we
go
on
to
look
at
control
after
we
look
at
state
law
in
our
brief.
but
i
agree
with
you,
the
primary
issue
in
this
case
is,
is
the
sheriff
a
state
official
or
a
county
official,
and
every
indication
here
is
that
the's
a
state
official.
this
court
said
the
issue--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
those
things
also
apply
equally
to
any
number
of
people--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
to
begin
with,
your
honor,
the
state
constitution
expressly
designates
him
a
state
official.
he
has...
the
same
removal
procedures
apply
to
him
that
only
apply
to
state
officials
and
not
to
any
municipal
officials.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
sure.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
state
legislature,
to
begin
with,
if
it's--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--if
that
policy
were
illegal,
he
could
be
impeached
by--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--if
he's--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--with
respect
to
law
enforcement
decisions
that
are
discretionary
and
are
wholly
legal,
he
has
discretion
to
make
that
decision
himself.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
just
as
any
number
of
other
state
officials
in
alabama
and
everywhere
else
have
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
to
set
policy
for
the
state--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--within
certain
confines
of
the
law.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
circuit
judges
in
alabama,
district
attorneys
in
alabama,
all
unquestionably
state
officials,
are
elected
locally,
their
quarters
and
their
equipment
are
all
provided
through
the
county
commission.
they--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--every
time
a
prosecutor
makes
judgments
about
which
crimes
he's
going
to
prosecute
or
not
prosecute,
within
the
bounds
of
the
law,
he's
essentially
setting
some
kind
of
policy,
and
he's
clearly
a
state
official
doing
that
within
the
confines
of
chambers
county.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i'm
not
saying
that.
that's
clearly
what
the
law
in
alabama
is.
the...
he
has...
i
should
note
a
sheriff
has
all
of
the
absolute
immunity
that
is
accorded
to
state
executive
branch
officials
in
alabama,
not
accorded
to
any
municipal
officials.
the
removal
authority...
and
there's
a
fair
amount
of
supervision
as
well
at
the
state
level.
the
governor
can
direct
him
to
conduct
investigations--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
supervision
of
this
particular
policy
could
occur
in
the
sense
that
the
governor
could
direct
him
to
investigate
the
capri
club,
could
also
demand
a
report
in
the
activities
that
he
has
been
conducting
with
respect
to
the
capri
club,
and
if
he
didn't
get
a
report
that
was
accurate,
he
could...
that
would
be
an
impeachable
offense
as
well,
so
there
is
some
degree
of--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--as
i
indicated
before,
if
it's
a
discretionary
decision
between
two
legal
options
about
how
to
conduct
a
raid--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
state
has
made
a
decision
to
allow
some
discretion.
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it's
a
matter
of
policy
that
he
sets
for
the
state
at
the
local
level.
i
think
the
other
thing
you
have
to
focus
on
here
is
the
eleventh
amendment.
this
court
just
last
month,
or
two
months
ago,
said
we
determine
whether
or
not
a
particular
branch
of
government
or
office
of
government
is
covered
by
the
eleventh
amendment
by
looking
at
who
would
pay
the
judgment.
that
was
in
the
hess
case
involving
the
port
authority
up
in
new
york.
that
is
precisely
the
test
of
the
eleventh
circuit
in
a
number
of
decisions
in
a
row
has
applied
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
sheriff
in
alabama
is
protected
from
suits
in
his
official
capacity
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
it
is
consistently
held
that
the
state
would
pay
the
judgment
precisely
because
the
state
has
always
treated
sheriffs
as
state
officials.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
if
he
was
sued
under
state
law,
there
would
be
absolute
immunity,
because
he
has
state
immunity
as
a
state
official.
if
he
was
sued--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--there's
a
board.
you
can
go
to
a
board
of
adjustment
for
discretionary
relief,
but
there's
absolute
immunity.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
there
might
be
a
suit...
i
guess
if
it
was
a
negligence
claim
he
couldn't
be
sued
under
1983,
but...
so
that
would
be
the
only
way,
your
honor.
you're
right.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
certainly
you
can
always
ask
the
district
judge
to
do
that.
i
think
the
chances
that
it
would
have
been
granted
in
this
case
we
can
all
speculate
about.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
1292(b)
applies
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
district
court
proceeding
should
be
suspended
and
an
appeal
should
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
that
is
already
occurring
as
a
matter
of
right
under
the
collateral--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--for
another
party
under
a
related
issue.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
but
that's
been
the
rule
that
this
court
has
applied
in
any
number
of
contexts.
whenever
there's
been
appellate
jurisdiction
to
reach
a
particular
order,
the
routine
rule
of
this
court
has
been
to
say--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--right.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
dealing
one
way
or
the
other
with
the
question
of
whether
the
pendent
discretionary
jurisdiction
of
an
appellate
court
can
include
a
claim
brought
involving
a
separate
party.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
would,
though,
your
honor,
point
the
court
to
an
area
of
the
law
that
was
not
discussed
in
either
of
the
supplemental
briefs,
and
that
is
appeals
that
used
to
come
to
this
court
under
section
1252,
which
until
1988
was
a
statute
that
authorized
direct
appeals
to
this
court
from
any
federal
decision
or
order,
interlocutory
or
otherwise,
holding
a
federal
statute
unconstitutional,
and
the
doctrine
that
was
applied
by
this
court
for
decades
was
that
such
an
appeal
not
only
brings
up
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
that
federal
statute,
but
brings
the
entire
case
up
to
this
court,
and
this
court
then
said
that
it
had
discretion
in
those
appeals
to
decide
any
issue
that
was
present
in
that
whole
case,
as
the
doctrine
read.
and
for
example,
in
the
williams
v.
zabares
case
in
1980,
this
court
dealt
with
an
appeal
from
a
federal
district
court
decision
holding
the
hyde
amendment
unconstitutional,
and
also
in
that
same
case
the
court
had
held
various
state
statutes
unconstitutional,
and
in
this
court,
the
court
held
that
the
district
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
even
discuss
the
hyde
amendment,
but
then
said
the
whole
case
is
here
so
we're
going
to
go
ahead
and
proceed
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
constitutionality
of
these
state
statutes,
issues
which
were
not
within
the
scope
of
the
statute
that
brought
the
case
up
to
this
court.
so
there
is--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--with
respect,
your
honor,
the
doctrine
was
that
on
an
appeal
from
an
interlocutory
order
with
respect
to
one
issue,
which
is
what
the
statute
authorized,
the
whole
case
comes
with
it,
and
there's
discretion
to
go
beyond
it,
which
is
all
we're
saying
here,
that
when
there's
an
appeal
of
one
issue
in
the
case,
courts
of
appeals,
just
as
they
do
in
preliminary
injunction
appeals,
just
as
they
do
in
mandamus
situations,
as
the
court
held
in
schlagenhof,
just
as
they
do...
used
to
under
1252
in
appeals
here,
ought
to
have
some
discretion
to
decide
issues
that
are
clearly
presented
in
the
record
of
the
case.
both
parties
are
telling
them
it's
appropriate
to
decide
it,
and
it
just
doesn't
make
any
practical
sense
to
tell
the
courts
of
appeals
that
they
have
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
knowing
that
what
they're
doing
is
condemning
the
district
court
to
carry
on
perhaps
years
of
proceedings
that
are
totally
unnecessary--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--because
of
some
legal
error.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
the
county
commission
didn't
actually
have
a
clear
ruling
yet
on
the
monell
issue,
but
if
we
had
had
a
clear
ruling
against
us
on
the
monell
issue,
then
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
judgment
to
enter,
because--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
claim
would
have
still
been
pending
against
the
county,
so
there
wouldn't
have
been
anything
to
certify
under--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
although,
your
honor,
the
issue
is
clearly
one
purely
of
law,
and
the
district
court
showed
some
confusion
about
that,
at
one
point
saying
that
there
was
enough
to
get
the
trial
on
the
factual
question.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
was
not...
there
clearly
was
not
a
final
determination
in
the
district
court
on
this
monell
issue.
but
the
court
of
appeals
saw
that
this
issue
was
presented
in
the
record
of
this
case.
it's
a
pure
issue
of
law
that
would,
if
resolved,
allow
the
county
to
be
entirely
exonerated
in
this
case,
and
it
said
there's
no
reason
why
we
shouldn't
go
ahead
and
reach
this
pure
legal
question
now
that
the
case
is
up
here,
and
help
to
expedite
the
processing
of
this
case,
something
that
made
eminent
practical
sense
in
the
context
of
this
case.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that's
absolutely
right,
because
all
he
would
have
been
saying
is
that
the
claim
is
legally
valid,
and
we
have
to
go
ahead
and
try
it.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
so
there
wouldn't
have
been
anything
to
get
a
54(b)
on,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
conceivably,
although
if
we
were
talking
about
a
separate
appeal
that
would
have
stopped
the
case
in
its
tracks,
there
would
have
been
all
sorts
of
issues
of
practicality
there.
here,
the
case
was
already
stopped
in
its
tracks.
the
county
is
sitting
there,
and
the
individual
defendants
are
going
up
on
appeal.
there's
clearly
not
going
to
be
any
sort
of
proceedings
in
the
meantime,
and
it
simply
asked
the
court
of
appeals
to
take
the
opportunity
that
was
presented
by
this
separate
appeal
to
resolve
the
additional
issue.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it
could
be,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--although
1292(b)
also
has
a,
you
know,
a
set
of
standards
that
have
to
be
met
that
might
not
be
met
here.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
when
you
have
a
different--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
other
thing,
of
course,
here,
is
the
county
defendant
was
faced
with
case
law
in
the
eleventh
circuit
which
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
this
was
a
perfectly
appropriate
thing
to
do,
so
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
sort
of
criticize
the
litigation
decision
which
was
made
to
go
ahead
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--sure.
sure.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
sure.
i
understand
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
no
reason
to
make
people
go
through
the
hoops
of
1292(b)
when
there's
already
the
case
going
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
related
issue.
at
that
point,
it
shouldn't
be
up
to
the
district
court
to
decide
what
the
court
of
appeals'
scope
of
review
should
be.
it
should
be...
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
the
traditional
authority.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
sure,
but
that's
exactly
what
1292(a)
says,
and
this
court
has
said
for
decades
that
when
you
get
a
preliminary
injunction
appeal
you
can
go
ahead
and
resolve
the
whole
case,
because
it
sometimes
makes
more
sense
to
do
that.
the
youngstown
sheet
&
tube
case
was
an
appeal
of
a
preliminary
injunction,
but
the
case
was
resolved
on
the
merits
because
the
court
has
this
equitable
discretion
to
go
ahead
and
broaden
its
review
beyond
the
particular
order
that--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--in
nearly
every--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
i
guess
i
would
say
that
you
should
look
at
the
traditional
way
that
the
scope
of
review
has
been
treated
differently
from
the
ability
to
appeal.
we're
talking
about
how
broadly
a
court
of
appeals
can
rule
once
the
case
is
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
there's
been
a
lot
of
play
in
those
joints
for
many,
many
years,
and
congress
has
never
done
anything
to
restrict
it.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
they've
become
more
split
after
abney
and
begun
to
move
in
that
direction,
but
i
think,
you
know,
one
thing
the
court
might
want
to
consider
in
looking
at
this
is
that
the
large
number
of
decisions
of
the
courts
of
appeals
which
have
continued
to
try
to
find
some
way
to
broaden
their
scope
of
review
in
these
situations
because
of
the
really
serious
practical
considerations
that
come
into
play
when
you're
a
court
of
appeals
judge
sitting
there,
knowing
that--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
if
you
think
about
it,
though,
the
distinction
between
pendent
claims
and
pendent
parties
is
much
murkier
and
much
less
clear
in
the
appellate
context
than
it
is
at
the
district
court
level,
because
the
county
was
going
to
be
a
party
to
this
appeal
at
least
as
an
appellee,
no
matter
what,
and
the
claim
of
the
county,
the
plaintiffs
against
the
county
was
going
to
get
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
sooner
or
later
no
matter
what,
so--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--right.
so
it's
a
question
of
timing,
rather
than
whether
or
not
this
is
a
dispute
that
will
ever
get
into
the
federal
courts,
which
was
what
the
court
was
faced
with
in
findley,
talking
about
pendent
parties
at
the
district
court
level.
so
i
think
taking
into
account
that
quite
different
set
of
circumstances,
and
taking
into
account
the
discretion
that
has
traditionally
been
read
into
statutes
as
specific
as
the
one
we're
dealing
with
here,
indeed,
more
specific,
like
1292(a),
that
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
we're...
when
we're
piggy-backing
on
top
of
a
separate
appeal,
that
we're
doing
anything
that
congress
would
have
thought
was
strange,
or
that
was
not
left
to
this
court
to
authorize
as
an
appropriate
scope
of
review
issue.
it's
not
a
question
of
new
appeals,
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
can
go
beyond
one
order
to
resolve
other
matters
while...
once
the
district
court
proceedings
have
been
stopped
in
their
tracks
and
the
case
has
been
brought
up.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
i
think
there
may
be
issues
where
the
district
court
would
appropriately
say,
this
is
not
sufficiently
serious
or
important--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--to
merit
a
1292(b).
excuse
me?
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
certainly
think
that
could
be
true,
but
at
the
same
time
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
once
the
case
is
going
up
with
another
appeal,
though,
there
may
be
lots
of
practical
reasons
why
the
court
of
appeals
would
want
to
reach
it,
even
though
it
might
not
satisfy
the
1292(b)
standards.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
think
there's
just
a
different
standard
that
should
be
applied
once
you're
talking
about
not
creating
an
appeal,
but
simply
what
issues
ought
to
be
decided
now
that
we've
gone
to
the
trouble
of
having
a
proceeding
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
at
that
point
the
court
of
appeals
is
just
deciding
what
state
the
case
should
be
in
when
we
send
it
back,
what
we
should
tell
the
district
court
to
do
on
remand.
it's
just
a
whole
different
set
of
practical
concerns
that
i
would
think
allow
a
broader,
freer
hand.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
two
points,
your
honor.
clearly,
there's
a
lot
of
cases
which
say
you
can
go
beyond
looking
at
probability
and
discretion
and
just
go
ahead
and
decide
the
merits.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
right.
now,
there
are
cases...
i'm
not
aware
of
a
case
in
this
court,
but
there
certainly
are
cases...
judge
friendly's
decision
in
the
semmes
motor
case
cited
in
our
brief,
where
there
are
just
essentially
two
different
issues.
there
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
there
ought
to
be
a
stay
entered
in
one
litigation,
and
then
there
was
a
preliminary
injunction,
and
judge
friendly
said,
i'm
going
to
go
ahead
and
decide
whether
the
district
court
should
have
entered
a
stay,
and
that
doesn't
affect
the
propriety
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
i
think
these
two
issues
ought
to
be
decided.
that
was
certainly
his
view
of
how
it
ought
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i've
not
found
such
a
case,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
and
if
you
think
that
the
distinction
in
parties
makes
a
big
difference,
then
that
is
clearly
a
difference.
as
i
was
saying,
i
think
that
in
an
appellate
context
where
you
already
have
the
second
party
coming
up
as
an
appellee
and
where--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--just
because
it's
a
party.
conceivably
it
could
be
in
there
arguing
that
the...
against
the
sheriff
trying
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--you
know,
so
that
the
codefendant
might
be
kept
in
the
case.
i
mean,
there
could
be
a
conflict
there.
that
certainly
will
arise
in
some
circumstances
as
well,
where
the
codefendants
are
against
each
other
on
appeal.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
it's
clear
as
a
matter
of
law
that
they
could
not
do
that,
that
they
are
not
authorized
by
state
law
to
have
any
opinion
whatever
about
law
enforcement
policy,
and
i
don't
think
that's
disputed
here,
so
if
such
a
thing
occurred,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
law
by
the
county
commission.
there
may
be
times
when
you
need
some
facts
about
custom
and
usage,
but
this
is
not
such
a
case.
here,
the
question
is,
what
position
does
the
sheriff
occupy
in
the
state
hierarchy,
and
should
he
be
properly
viewed
as
a
state
official
or
as
a
county
official?
mr.
paul
m.
smith
they
have
to...
they
have
to
pay
the
money
that
goes
to
pay
his
salary,
which
is
set
by
state
law,
and
sufficient
supplies
and
material
to
let
him
carry
out
his
office,
and
they
have
to
give
him
a
jail
and
an
office
to
work
in
just
as--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--there
can
be
litigation
over
this
issue.
what
happens
is
that
the
county
commission
appropriates
a
certain
amount
of
money,
and
if
the
sheriff
thinks
it's
un...
doesn't
satisfy
the
state's
statutory
standard
of
reasonable
necessity,
then
the
sheriff
sues
the
county
commission.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
think
there
probably
is...
i'm
sort
of
getting
into
speculation
here,
your
honor.
there
may
well
be
some
county
executive
official
who
could
determine
whether
or
not
he's
actually
stealing
money
from
the
county
and
not
spending
it
on
inappropriate
use,
or
something
like
that.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
sheriff
is
a
county
official
in
this
case
is
so
clear
as
a
matter
of
law
that
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
how
anybody
could
suggest
that
the
reason
to
reverse
here
would
be
that
it
was
preliminary.
this...
the
guy's
clearly
covered
by
the
eleventh
amendment
under
the
standard
that
this
court
announced
just
2
months
ago,
and
the
state
constitution--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
well...
i
can
understand
how--
[laughter]
--at
first
blush
the
suggestion
that
maybe
a
county
sheriff
is
not
a
county
official
might
have
struck
the
court
as
odd,
but
in
fact
if
you
view
it
in
a
historical
context
the...
there's
really
little
doubt
that
the
state
has
taken
responsibility
for
this
official.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
if
he's
a
county
official,
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
he's
a
county
policymaker
on
law
enforcement.
if
he's
a
state
official--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
if
the
state
law
held
that,
that
was--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--if
he's
a
state
official--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
the
court
ought
to
look--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
to
be
fair...
to
be
fair,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
conceivable
you
could
have
a
state
official
who
in
some
of
his
functions
is
deputized
to
perform
municipal
functions.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
state
constitution.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
in
many
of
his
functions
he
is
supervised
by
the
state
officials.
the
governor
can
require
reports,
can
require
investigations--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
circuit
judges
supervise
him,
the
district
attorneys
supervise
him,
the
state
department
of
corrections
supervises
him.
the
county
commission
by
law
has
no
authority
to
supervise
him,
which
also
indicates
that
he's
a
state
official.
he
also
has
the
immunities
that
are
given
to
state
officials
under
state
law
but
not
given
to
municipal
officials
under
state
law.
i
think
ultimately,
though,
the
court
ought
to
look
at
the
eleventh
amendment
ruling
more
than
anything
else,
because
the
court
said
in
will
that
the
distinction
between
state
defendants
and
municipal
defendants
is
coterminous
with
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
we're
going
to
not
assume
that
the
congress
meant
to
overrule
any
aspect
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
here--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's
correct.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
think
the
state
of
alabama,
for
its
good
and
sufficient
reasons,
has
decided
there
needs
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
over
law
enforcement
functions
at
the
local
level,
because
crime
is
local
and
that's
where
we're
going
to
have
it
enforced.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
i
think
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
county
officials.
when
i
answered
that,
i
was
assuming
that
he
meant
by
county
officials
people
who
are
designated
by
state
law
as
the
chief
person
of
a
particular
area
function
for
that
county
as
a
municipal
corporation.
i
think--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
it
is
possible
for
state
law
to
set
up
autonomous
executive
officials
who
speak
for
a
particular
municipal
corporation,
if
the
law
very
clearly
does
that.
the
control
issue
really
comes
in
when
it's
murkier
and
where
somebody's
making
the
claim,
well,
sure
they
call
him
a
state
official
in
the
state
constitution,
but
in
reality
he's
more
of
a
local
official.
look,
he's
elected
locally.
and
then
i
say
at
that
point
you
really
ought
to
look
at
whether
or
not
he's
controlled
by
the
governing
body
of
the
county.
thank
you,
your
honor.
