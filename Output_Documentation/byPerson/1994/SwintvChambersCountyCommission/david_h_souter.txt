justice
david
h.
souter
--why
isn't
the
answer
to
that
the
holding
in
abney,
which
was
on
the
books
when
1292(b)
was
enacted
by
congress?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
would
be
a
point
to
be
considered,
but
it's
also
the
case
that
we're
trying...
or
if
our
object
is
to
consider
what
congress'
understanding
of
the
scope
of
1291
and
1292(b)
might
be,
the
fact
that
abney
came
first
before
the
enactment
of
1292(b)
would
be
a
reason,
whatever
its
soundness,
for
assuming
that
congress
intended
the
exclusive
means
of
getting
these
related
cases...
related
issues
to
beat
1292(b).
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
why
should
we
make
that
assumption?
abney
was
there
on
the
books.
congress
enacted
1292(b)
a
couple
of
years
later.
i
mean,
i
would
suppose
the
reasonable
assumption
is
that
congress
knew
what
we
had
been
doing
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
does
the
county
commission
have
to
have
control?
for
example,
let's
assume
the
county
commissioners
made
ultimate
law
enforcement
policy
for
the
county.
the
county
would
be
responsible
for
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
so
if
the
repository
of
discretionary
authority
over
law
enforcement
happens
to
be
in
the
sheriff
rather
than
in
the
county
commission,
why
wouldn't
the
county,
for
the
same
reasons,
be
liable?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
they
do,
i
take
it
your
answer
is,
yes,
the
county
would
be
responsible.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
issue
as
you
see
it
is
not
whether
there
happens
to
be
a
county
commission
between
"the
county"
and
the
sheriff,
the
issue
is
whether
the
sheriff
is,
in
fact,
a
county
official.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
not
every
indication.
i
mean,
he's
elected
by
the
county,
he's
paid
by
the
county,
his
expenses
are
paid
by
the
county,
his
jurisdictional
is
countywide.
i
mean,
those
are
indications
that
he
is
a
county
official.
justice
david
h.
souter
for
purposes
of
1983,
at
least.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
there
cases
where
it
might
be
appropriate
to
piggy-back
but
where
a
certification
could
not
be
made
under
1292(b)?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
appropriately
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
appropriately
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
should
think
that
would
be
a
good
reason
for
saying
they
shouldn't
get
up
at
that
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
is
the
court
of
appeals'
interests
significantly
different
from
the
district
court's
interest
here?
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
smith,
may
i
just
go
back
to
one
point?
you
were
speaking
of
the
supervisory
authority
of
state
officials.
i
take
it
you
agree
that
there
is
no
supervisory
authority
that
would
require
the
sheriff
to
get
the
approval
of
a
state
official
before
setting
the
kind
of
policy
for
the
county
that
is
alleged
to
have
been
in
effect
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
as
he
said
in
justice
stevens'
question,
now,
if
we're
going
to
have
raids
in
this
way,
with
people
dressed
like
this,
without
prior
notice
and
so
on,
there's
no
one
in
the
state
that
he
has
to...
at
the
level
of
state
government
whose
approval
he
has
to
get
in
order
to
implement
that
policy.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
