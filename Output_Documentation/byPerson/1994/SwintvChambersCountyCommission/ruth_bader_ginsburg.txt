justice

bader

suppose
the
district
judge
had
been
asked
and
then...
and
refused
to
certify
under
1292(b),
could
the
eleventh
circuit
nonetheless
exercise
pendent
appellate
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--perhaps
this
is
a
question
better
reserved
for
your
opponent,
but
when...
when
the
question
of
pendent
appellate
jurisdiction
drawing
in
other
parties
came
up
for
the
district
courts,
congress
provided
the
solution
in
1367,
is
it,
in
1990.
why
should
we
approve
a
court-made
solution
to
the
problem
on
the
appellate
level?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
very
purpose
of
a
final
judgment
rule
that
says,
you
reserve
all
of
your
objections
all
the
way
down
the
line,
and
then
you
have
an
appeal
from
the
final
judgment.
that's
the
very
objective
of
a
final
judgment
rule.
but
you
didn't
ask
the
eleventh
circuit
to
do
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
opponent
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
perhaps
we
ought
to
let
you
address
the
next
question
you
have
and
ask
your
opponent,
who
was
responsible
for
bringing
the
pendent
claim
urging
the
eleventh
circuit
to
take
it,
to
continue
with
the
1292(b)/1291
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
sheriff
has
eleventh
amendment
immunity
for
suits
against
him
in
his
official
capacity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfson,
you
relied
on
three
factors,
the
election,
his
salary
is
paid
by
the
county,
the
expenses
of
his
office
are
paid
by
the
salary...
by
the
county.
is
there
anything
more
that's
needed,
as
you
view
the
case,
to
impose
1983
liability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
sheriff
ran
over
somebody
in
the
course
of
getting
to
some
investigation,
who
would
pay
that
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
no
tort
claims
thing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could...
is
there
any...
you
said,
if
he's
sued
under
state
law.
is
there
any
other
way
for
him
to
be
sued?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
meant
judgments
in
general,
not
1983.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of
the
concerns,
which
we
don't
know
perhaps
everything
that
there
is
to
know
about
this,
is
because
the
district
judge
was
cut
off,
and
since
you
are
the
person
responsible
for
bringing
this
to
the
eleventh
circuit,
i
would
like
to
step
back
and
talk
about
the
legitimacy
of
bringing
the
county
up
before
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
first,
do
you
agree
that
you
could
have
asked
the
district
judge
to
certify
this
question
of
the
county's
responsibility
under
1292(b)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
that's
so,
aren't
you
just
doing
an
end
run
around
what
congress
wanted?
congress
deliberately
put
in
place
a
two-level
discretion.
first,
the
district
judge
has
to
say,
this
interlocutory
order
is
appealable.
then,
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
agree.
by
this
pendent
party
appellate
jurisdiction,
aren't
you
just
demolishing
that
two-level
discretion
that
congress
put
in
place
in
1292(b)?
you
could
do
an
end
run
around
1292(b)
every
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
another
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
extent,
you
do
an
end
run
around
12...
any
time
you
have
a
legitimate
interlocutory
appeal
of
any
party
in
the
case,
then
it's
totally
discretionary
with
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
district
court
thinks.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
what
is
the
routine
rule
of
this
court
with
respect
to
pendent
party
appellate
jurisdiction?
you've
given
the
example
of
isen,
which
involved
the
same
parties.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
routine
practice
with
bringing
up
a
party
who
could
never
have
gotten
there
on
any
question
on
her
own,
and
pending
that
party
without
consulting
the
district
judge...
the
district
judge
here
said,
i'm
not
finished.
i'm
going
to
revisit
this
before
the
case
goes
to
the
jury,
and
even
so
it
goes
up
on
your
theory
that
it's
all
discretionary
with
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
you're
not
aware,
then
it
can't
be
the
routine
practice
of
this
court
to
sanction
pendent
appellate
jurisdiction
over
a
party
who
could
not
be
there
otherwise.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
just
the
opposite--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
district
judge
said
he
wasn't
finished
with
it.
he
said,
i'm
not
making
a
final
ruling.
i'm
going
to
revisit
this
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
was
not
only
interlocutory
within
the
case
itself,
but
the
district
judge
said,
i'm
not
even
finished
with
this
single
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
even
if
the
district
judge
had
said,
i
think,
and
i'm
not
going
to
change
my
mind,
that
this
county
is
liable
under
12...
under
1983,
and
now
i'm
going
to
hear
the
case
on
the
merits--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
couldn't
have
gotten
a
54(b)
order
even
then.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
might
have
gotten
a
1292(b).
at
least
that
would
have
been
technically
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
when
congress
addressed
this
issue,
it
decided
it
wasn't
going
to
leave
it
all
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
could
have
done
that.
it
could
have
done...
just
had
that
one
discretionary
level,
but
it
deliberately
said
we
want
the
district
judge
to
say
if
that
judge
thinks
that
this
is
going
to
expedite
the
case,
an
immediate
appeal,
and
if
the
district
judge
says
no,
then
under
1292(b)
you
can't
do
it.
now,
you
presented
this
as,
this
is
a
routine
matter,
but
i
think
now
you
recognize
that
it
isn't
routine,
that
we
have
never
authorized
pendent
party
appellate
jurisdiction--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
congress
certainly
hasn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
later,
not
sooner--
--it
was--
--because
the
district
judge
wasn't
finished
with
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
one
of
the
reasons
was
the
district
could
have
made
a
difference...
you
said
it's
a
pure
question
of
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
custom
and
usage
counts
also
under
1983,
and
perhaps
when
the
district
judge
said,
i'm
going
to
revisit
this,
my
decision
is
not
final,
that's
what
he
had
in
mind.
that's
what
judge
varner
had
in
mind,
that
he
wanted
to
look
at
not
only
what
was
formerly
in
the
alabama
statute.
for
example,
do
we
know
whether...
could
the
county
commission
have
said,
this
kind
of
raid
is
something
we
don't
like,
so
we
are
telling
this
sheriff
that
we're
simply
not
going
to
pay
for
it?
you're
going
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
raid,
we're
not
going
to
pay
for
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
when
they...
don't
they
audit
his
books,
or...
they
pay
for
his
office.
don't
they
have
to
audit
his
books?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
do
they
exercise
supervision
at
least
to
the
extent
of
making
sure
that
he's
not
dining
at
the
fanciest
restaurant
in
town
and
charging
the
county
for
that?
don't
they
go
over
his--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
mean,
does
anybody
look
at
his
books
to
see
how
he
is
spending
the
county's
money,
and
who
is
that
somebody
who
does
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
only
stealing,
but
not
acting
unlawfully,
or
in
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
spending
the
county's
money
in
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there
is
a
county
body,
somebody
commissioned
by
the
county
commission
to
audit
the
books...
that's
my
question,
is
maybe
yes,
maybe
no,
but
the
district
judge
didn't
have
a
chance
to
explore
any
of
that
because
you
took
it
right
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
same
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
same
people
were
already
there
anyway.
i
was
asking
if
there
were
any
case,
any
authority
from
this
court
where
you
bring
up
somebody
who
could
not
have
gotten
there
as
a
petitioner
or
respondent
and
let
that
person,
who
the
district
judge
isn't
finished
with,
and
say
i
can
piggy-back
on
this
other
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
one
can
understand
why
courts
of
appeals
would
be
biased
in
favor
of
their
discretion
to
the
exclusion
of
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
stems
from
two
warrants
less
police
raids
on
a
night
club
in
chambers
county,
alabama.
individuals
affected
by
the
raid,
sued
the
chambers
county
commission
and
three
police
officers
asserting
civil
rights
violations.
the
defendants
sought
the
pretrial
dismissal
of
the
case.
the
three
police
officers
argued
that
they
were
immune
from
the
suit
because
they
had
violated
no
clearly
established
federal
law.
the
chambers
county
commission
argued
that
the
sheriff
who
had
authorized
the
raid
worked
for
the
state
of
alabama
not
for
chambers
county.
the
district
court
refused
to
dismiss
the
case
without
trail,
the
individual
police
officers
immediately
appealed;
they
invoked
a
rule
that
allowed
instant
appellate
review
when
a
trial
court
rejects
an
officer’s
plea
of
immunity
from
suit.
the
county
commission
also
appealed
and
the
viability
of
that
appeal
is
the
question
we
decide
today.
it
is
the
general
rule
that
appeals
may
be
taken
only
at
the
end
of
the
road
when
the
trial
court
is
finished
dealing
with
the
entire
case.
the
county
commission
asked
us
deviate
from
that
main
rule
and
to
decide
the
question
of
it's
liability
at
once
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
county
commission
urges
that
the
order
requiring
it
to
proceed
to
trial
could
not
be
reviewed
in
a
meaningful
way
after
trial.
second,
the
commission
argued
that
it
would
be
economical
to
hear
it's
appeal
together
with
the
police
officers
appeal,
adapting
only
the
second
reason
the
judicial
economy
reason,
the
court
of
appeals
exercise
pendant
appellate
jurisdiction
and
decided
the
case
definitively
in
favor
of
the
county
commission.
we
hold
unanimously
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
last
authority
to
take
up
the
county
commission’s
appeal
at
this
preliminary
stage
of
the
litigation.
unlike
the
district
courts
order
denying
the
police
officers
pled
of
immunity
from
suit,
the
order
refusing
to
dismiss
the
liability
claim
against
the
county
commission
can
be
reviewed
in
a
meaningful
way
after
trial
and
of
vital
importance,
the
district
courts
order
refusing
to
dismiss
the
claims
against
the
county
commission
was
only
a
tentative
order,
the
court
plan
to
reconsider
the
question
of
the
commission’s
liability
before
jury
deliberations.
our
opinion
explains
why
the
county
commission
cannot
lax
on
two
or
append
this
appeal
to
the
police
officers
appeals
by
statute
congress
has
authorized
district
court
to
certify
for
immediate
review
orders
that
the
trial
judge
considered
as
important,
pivotal
and
debatable.
congress
has
also
authorized
this
court
to
use
the
rule
making
process
to
define
and
levying
the
rules
governing
the
timing
of
appeals.
if
courts
of
appeals
had
pendent
appellate
authority
of
the
kind
asserted
here
this
congressional
design
between
district
court
certification
and
multifaceted
rule
making
would
be
severely
undermined.
the
county
commission
therefore
may
not
appeal
now
and
must
abide
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
