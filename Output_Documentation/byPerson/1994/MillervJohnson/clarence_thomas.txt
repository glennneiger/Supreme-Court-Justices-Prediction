mr.
parks,
let
me
change
the
facts
just
a
little.
let's
say
that
the
georgia
legislature,
anticipating
that
they
were
going
to
have
some
difficulty
in
retaining
the
white
vote...
let's
say,
the
democrats...
decided
that
our
loyal
constituent,
90-percent
voters
for
the
democratic
party,
are
blacks,
so
now
that
we
have
this
additional
district,
let's
make
sure
that
we
have
a
solid
democratic
district,
and
the
eleventh
district
was
drawn
solely
to
have
a
solid
democratic
district,
and
to
include
the
most
loyal
democratic
voters.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
clarence
thomas
that's
not
my
question.
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you,
but
that's
really
not
my
question.
my
question
is
purely
political.
the
state
of
georgia
is
becoming
increasingly
republican.
we
don't
want
to
lose
the
entire
state.
the...
to
retain
at
least
three
districts,
we
will
go...
we
will
create
three
districts
with
our
most
loyal
democratic
voters,
who
happen
to
be
black.
let's
say
that
is
the
purpose
for
the
three
districts.
what
is
wrong
with
that?
