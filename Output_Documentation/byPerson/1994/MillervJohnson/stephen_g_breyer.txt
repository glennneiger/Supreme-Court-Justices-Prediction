justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
in
your...
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then,
in
your
view,
if
people
in
the
legislature
take
race,
or
religion,
or
nationality
into
account
and
put
lots
of
members
of
one
group
into
a
district
for
a
host
of
political
reasons,
then
the
court
system,
the
700
federal
judges,
or
whatever,
will
start
to
reexamine
that.
is
that
what
your
statement
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
do
the
same
thing,
but
a
lot
of
democrats
are
also
of
group
x
that
isn't
black,
and
they
put
them
in,
or
in
california
they
put
in
another
group,
and
in
illinois...
you
understand
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
is
the
same
problem
throughout,
that
is
there...
how
do
you
define...
throughout...
if
i
put
the
problem
in
my
mind,
it's
this
way.
throughout
history,
maybe
race,
religion,
nationality,
and
a
host
of
similar
factors
have
been
taken
into
account
in
districting.
i
take
it
under
shaw
v.
reno
that
sometimes
the
single
factor
of
race,
while
it
could
be
taken
into
account,
goes
too
far.
all
right.
what's
the
criterion
by
which
you
measure
going
too
far?
now,
i
understand
the
opposite
side's
criteria.
they
say,
you
don't
go
too
far.
you
don't
even
get
into
this
matter
unless
you
have
a
bizarrely
shaped
district
that
differs
in
significant
ways
from
what
used
to
be
in
this
state,
because
that
bizarrely
shaped
district
is
a
signal,
a
signal
that
the
consideration
went
too
far.
now,
there
could
be
other
kinds
of
signals.
what
are
the
other
signals,
in
your
view,
because
if
we
could
find
a
signal,
then
perhaps...
and
i
could
understand
an
application
of
shaw
that
wouldn't
turn
everything
topsy-turvy,
but
what
are
the
signals?
the
solicitor
general
says,
i'll
tell
you
one,
that
the
shape
is
so
bizarre
when
considered
with
the
past
that
that
fact,
together
with
the
racial
motivation,
provides
a
threshold.
now,
maybe
i
don't...
maybe
that
isn't
the
right
signal,
maybe
i
don't
have
it
right,
but
i'm
trying
to
get
your
view
on
that
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then,
fine.
then
that...
you've
righted
my
question,
and
i'm
sorry
to...
but
then,
1)
i
can
understand
this
possibility,
as
several
of
the
briefs
have
stated
and
the
amicus
briefs
have
stated.
first,
you
have
a
threshold.
maybe
it
is
visual,
to
show
that
it
went
too
far.
then,
once
you
go
beneath
the
threshold,
you
look
to
see
if
there's
a
compelling
interest,
namely
a
remedy
for
past
discrimination,
of
which
there
has
been
plenty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
then
you
look
for
tailoring
under
the
five
traditional
criteria
of
whether...
that
this
court
has
put
out.
i
understand
that.
i'm
not
saying
it's
correct.
i
understand
it.
i
understand
the
alternative,
which
would
be
to
go
into
every
district
in
half
the
counties
in
this
state,
and
what
i'm
looking
for,
is
there
some
other
way
of
doing
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
it
a
compelling...
isn't
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--couldn't
it
be
a
compelling
interest
that
in
a
particular
place
for
many,
many
years...
many,
many,
many,
many
yeas
the
state
was
set
up
in
such
a
way
to
prevent
african
americans
from
having
the
same
kind
of
vote,
or
even
having
a
vote,
as
other
persons
had?
i
mean,
wouldn't
that
be
a
justification,
possibly,
in
particular
circumstances
for
overcoming
the
effects
of
a
history
of
discrimination?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then,
would
we
then
use--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
then
would
we
then
use,
if
we
got
past
the
threshold
and
then
we
found
such
a
compelling
interest,
then
would
you
not
use
what
the
abrams
briefs
or
some
of
the
briefs
have,
the
five,
the
traditional
tests
that
this
court's
developed
in
order
to
show
narrow
tailoring
that...
limited
in
duration...
you
know
the
five.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
limited
in
duration,
it's
roughly--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--equivalent
to
the--
