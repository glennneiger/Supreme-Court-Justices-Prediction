justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
an
issue
about
the
"why"
here?
i
thought
in
this
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
in
the
other
one,
there's
no
doubt
that
the
object
was
to
create
a
majority
minority
district.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
contested?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you'd
like
to
say
purpose
or
goal
instead
of
object,
that's
okay
with
me,
but
that
was
indeed
the
purpose
or
goal,
to
create
a
majority
minority--
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
if
georgia
should
deliberately
draw
a
district
in
order
to
prevent
blacks
from
electing
a
representative,
there
would
be
nothing
we
could
do
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
cannot--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
said
we
can't
do
anything
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed
we
did,
but
you're
now
telling
us
we
can't.
isn't
it
the
same
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
harm
proven.
the
harm
proven
is
that
someone
who
said
he
would
be
in
this
district
has
been
excluded
from
it
because
of
his
race.
you're
arguing
shaw
v.
reno
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
it's
any
more
difficult
to
figure
out
whether
the
legislature
drew
its
lines
to
put
blacks
in
or
to
keep
blacks
out.
the
one
question
is
the
same
as
the
other
question,
and
the
notion
that
one
is
impossible
for
us
to
determine
but
the
other
is
not,
i
don't
understand
the
reason
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
walbert,
let's
assume
i
think
strict
scrutiny
is
needed.
why...
did
georgia
do
any
study
about
whether
there's
a
compelling
state
interest
in
having
majority
minority
districts?
did
it
do
any
studies
as
to
whether
blacks
are
better
off
in
having
all
of
their
power
concentrated
in
a
few
districts
rather
than
being
dispersed
more
throughout
the
state
so
that
representatives
from
all
the
districts
will
have
to
take
into
account
black
people's
point
of
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
some
people
think
that's
the
best
way
to
reduce
the
influence
of
black
groups.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
did
a
study
to
see
how
much
the
blacks'
interests
were
taken
into
account
by
white
politicians,
even
though
the
politicians
elected
might
be
white,
did
they
not
have
to
cater
to
the
interests
of
the
black
one
in
their
district?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
have
to
consider
whether
that's
a
compelling
state
interest
or
not,
i
don't
know
we
can
just
sort
of
say,
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
political
process
made
that
judgment.
i
think...
it
isn't
self-evident
to
me
that
that's
a
better
way
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
mean
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
point
is
whether
the
political
desires
of
black
people
are
being
taken
into
account.
we
don't
in
this
country...
you
know,
supposedly
we're
not
supposed
to
care
about
the
color
of
people.
the
point
is
whether
the
political
interests
of
black
people
were
being
taken
into
account.
do
you
know
of
any
studies
that
say
they're
better
off
by
having
all
blacks
lumped
into
a
couple
of
districts
who
can
elect
somebody
who
is
black?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i'm
sure
the
officials
elected
think
it's
a
grand
idea--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
i'm
talking
about
whether
it's
a
grand
idea
for
the
racial
minority
that
you
assert
to
protect.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
constitution
has
as
an
objective
integrated
delegations?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
can
understand
the
constitution
has
as
an
objective
that
the
political
interests
of
every
individual,
including
minority
races
and
everything,
should
be
taken
into
account,
but
the
constitution
says
that
the
georgia
delegation
has
to
have
people
of
various
races.
is
that
what
the
constitution
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
like
treating
people
on
the
basis
of
their
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
i
thought
you
were
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
you
were
saying
that
was
a
constitutional...
desirable.
you're
just
saying
the
constitution
was
neutral
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
recognized
on
that
basis.
there
was
no
study
done
to
show
that
the
people
in
this
particular
district
have
a
whole
lot
of
community...
the
judgment
was
made,
blacks
have
a
community
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
racial--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
simply
racial
classification.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
there
has
been
a
political
gerrymander,
as
occurred
in
the
case
we
heard
just
before
this
one,
then
you
could
do
a
racial
district
that
more
or
less
matches
that
political
gerrymander,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
you
just
said,
so
long
as
you
conform
to
past
practice.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
they've
been
doing
this
in
louisiana
for
a
long
time.
they
have--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i
mean,
you're
lucky,
or
you're
unlucky,
depending
on
whether
you
want
to
use
racial
districting
or
not.
if
you're
lucky
enough
to
come
from
a
state
that's
been
using
gerrymanders,
you
can
do
it,
and
if
you're
unlucky
enough
to
come
from
a
state
that
hasn't
been,
as
you
tell
me
georgia
is,
then
you
can't
do
it.
does
that
make
very
much
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
ought
to
reconsider
your
position
about
whether,
you
know,
the
criterion
is
whether
you've
done
it
like
this
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
need
evidence
if
there's
an
admission.
i
mean,
what
if
you
come
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we've
done
it
for
this
purpose?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
an
earlier
question
that
justice
thomas
asked
about
adopting
an
odd-shaped
district
in
order
to
maximize
the
number
of
democratic
voters,
or
republican
voters,
whatever.
you
said
it
would
be
bad
if
you
simply
crammed
a
lot
of
voters
of
a
certain
race
into
that
district
in
order
to
maximize
the
vote
of
a
party,
knowing
that
that
race
votes
90
percent
one
way
or
the
other.
suppose
you
didn't
do
it
that
way,
however.
suppose
you
just
looked
at
the
voting
returns,
and
without
considering
race,
drew
the
same
weird-shaped
district.
it
would
come
out
the
same
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
precincts,
about
which
precincts
voted
republican,
which
voted
democratic,
and
when
you
ended
up,
you
had
an
odd-shaped
district
that
was
60
percent
black.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
be
a
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
probably
the
way
parties
do
political
gerrymandering,
isn't
it,
by
looking
at
the
returns
and
including
within
the
gerrymandered
district
those
precincts
that
have
returns
going
for
one
party,
the
other
whatever,
whether
it's
blacks
or
whites
that
were
responsible
for
the
returns.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
sure.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
stevens
is
from
chicago
in
the
good
old
days.
[laughter]
