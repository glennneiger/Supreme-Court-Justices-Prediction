mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
address
first
the
issue
that
members
of
the
court
have
raised
on
several
occasions
in
both
the
prior
argument
and
this
argument,
and
that
is
the
predominant
or
motivating
factor.
our
position
is
that
that
is
not
the
proper
analysis.
the
proper
analysis
under
shaw
or
under
this
court's
prior
precedents
is
whether
the
state
is
doing
something
for
blacks
that
it
would
not
do
for
others.
that
is,
where
blacks
are
being
treated
differently,
given
different
treatment,
arguably
to
assist
blacks,
that
it
would
not
provide
for
other
groups.
if
that
can
be
established
either
by
looking
at
the
shape
of
the
district
or
of
some
other
evidence,
that
is
sufficient
to
move
the
case
into
strict
scrutiny.
but
in
our
estimation,
that
has
to
be
the
threshold
analysis.
it
picks
up
many
of
the
questions
that
have
come
from
the
bench
today.
that
is,
if
the
state
is
drawing
districts
that
it
would
draw
for
polish
americans,
or
for
scottish
irish
in
louisiana,
or
for
other
groups,
then
our
position
is
that
does
not
trigger
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
i'm
not
arguing
that
it
is
subject
to
strict
scrutiny,
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
if
the
state
were
not
to
treat
blacks
who
have
a
community
of
interest,
and
that
can
be
established
in
the
record,
as
it
would
treat
other
groups,
then
blacks
are
being
denied
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
because
the
only
reason
they're
being
denied
the
treatment
that
others
receive
is
because
of
the
color
of
their
skins.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
don't
believe
it
does,
with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
one
looks
at
this
case,
for
example,
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
there
was
evidence
that
was
partially
convincing
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
community
of
interest
among
african
americans
within
the
eleventh
district,
but
what
the
court
said
is
as
follows,
and
this
is
at
44a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix:
it
says,
"the
problem
with
this
tack
is
that,
while
partially
convincing,
such
a
community
of
interest
is
barred
from
constitutional
recognition.
"
that
cannot
be
correct
under
the
constitution.
it
cannot
be
the
case
that
blacks
who
share
political
interest,
social
interest,
economic
interest,
a
history
of
discrimination
against
them
based
upon
their
race,
cannot
be
recognized
as
a
community
that
has
a
right
to
representation
in
the
halls
of
congress.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
but
justice
scalia--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--just
read
you--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
just
read
you
what
the
court
said
about
this,
that
there
was
partially
convincing...
in
other
words,
there
was
evidence
that
there
was
a
community
of
interest
that
transcended
race.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
don't
concede
that.
i
think
that
what
happened
here--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think
that
what
the
court
did
here
was
apply
an
incorrect
legal
standard.
that
is,
rather
than
trying
to
determine
whether
georgia
had
done
something
differently
for
blacks
than
it
had
done
for
other
groups,
it
concluded
that
because
race
was
involved
in
the
process,
even
a
predominating--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--consideration,
that
it
automatically
moved
into
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
what
the
court
did
was
not
look
at
the
extent
to
which
the
district
that
was
drawn
was
consistent
with
principles
that
georgia
had
applied
in
a
variety
of
other
circumstances.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
don't
believe
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
i
think
what
the
court
did
here
was
ignore
the
fact,
which
the
dissent
brings
out
very
clearly,
that
what
georgia
was
doing
was
consistent
with
what
it
had
done
in
the
past,
that
there
was
no
state
requirement
of
compactness,
that
there
had
been
no
state
requirement
that
you
couldn't
split
counties,
that
you
couldn't
split
cities.
that's
what
georgia
had
done
in
the
past,
so
the
question
becomes
one
of,
was
georgia
doing
something
different
in
this
case--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
relevance
is
that
if
one
looks
at
the
letters
from
the
department
of
justice,
what
those
letters
reflect
was
that
georgia
was
doing
not
only
with
respect
to
the
congress,
congressional
delegations,
but
with
respect
to
the
state
senate
and
the
state
lower
body
things
that
it
was
not
doing
with
respect
to
other
groups.
that
is,
it
was
fragmenting
black
populations,
it
was
moving
blacks
out
of
districts
where
they
appropriately
belonged,
and
those
were
the
reasons
why
the
objections
were
lodged
against
those
two
plans.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
absolutely--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--absolutely
not.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
i--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--what
the...
i
don't
accept
the
characterization
of
the
court,
but
i
won't
dignify
it
by
going
into
the
details.
the
point
is,
the
justice
department
was
doing
what
the
congress
of
the
united
states
directed
it
to
do
and
what
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
given
the
attorney
general
the
power
to
do.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
maximization,
but
the
answer--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--absolutely
not.
i
mean,
that
is
not
the
policy
of
the
justice
department.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
it
would.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
because
the
mandate
of
the
voting
rights
act
is
to
remedy
discrimination
and
to
prevent
actions
that
would
harm
groups
that
are
protected
under
the
act.
to
the
extent
the
attorney
general
is
carrying
out
her
responsibilities
in
ways
that
don't
connect
with
the
purpose
underlying
the
act,
then
there
would
be
problems
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
if
maximization
means
that
the
justice
department
was
requiring
something
that
was
not
reflective
of
the
fact
that
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect,
then
that
would
create
constitutional
problems,
but
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
i
think
if
one
looks
at
the
record,
looks
at
the
letters
at
99
and
120
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
is
clear
that...
may
i
complete
my
answer?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
the
justice
department
was
looking
at
what
georgia
had
done,
looking
at
the
fact
that
there
had
been
prior
findings
of
unconstitutional
purpose,
and
simply
saying,
you've
got
to
do
more,
given
these
facts.
thank
you
very
much.
