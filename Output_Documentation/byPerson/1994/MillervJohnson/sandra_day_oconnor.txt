o'connor
well,
why
is
district
shape
any
more
objective
as
a
criteria
than
discriminatory
purpose?
i
don't
see
that
it
is.
i
think
they're
both
objective.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
findings
of
the
court
below
indicated
that
the
department
of
justice
was
insisting
upon
maximization
of
any
possible
black
voting
strength.
it
was
not
retrogressive
for
the
state
to
create
two
districts,
but
the
department
of
justice
insisted
on
three
majority
minority,
and
the
court
found
that
to
be
the
case,
and
was
it
the
policy
of
the
department
of
justice
to
insist
upon
maximization--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
all
possible--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--strength?
i
mean,
it
certainly
appeared
to
be
the
case,
and--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--even
to
the
extent
that
confidential
informants
were
used
by
the
department
of
justice
and
within
the
state
legislative
process.
it
was
quite
a
dramatic
story,
actually.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if,
in
fact,
that
is
what
the
department
was
requiring,
can
that
serve
as
a
justification?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
legislature
is
found
by
the
court
to
have
been
so
driven
by
racial
considerations
that
it
ignores
compactness
and
contiguity
in
a
way
that
it
would
not
and
has
not
for
any
other
group,
and
that
it
was
driven
to
do
it
for
the
purpose
of
maximizing
a
particular
race
in
the
district.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
you
say
that
if
the
legislature
is
so
driven
by
race
that
it
ignores
compactness
and
contiguity
in
a
way
that
it
would
not
and
has
not
for
any
other
group,
that
that
would
state
an
equal
protection
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
parks--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
they're
here
defending
it
today,
aren't
they?
