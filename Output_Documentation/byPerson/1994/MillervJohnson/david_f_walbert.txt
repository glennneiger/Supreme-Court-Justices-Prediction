mr.
david
f.
walbert
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
in
this
courtroom
today
almost
exactly
one
half
century
after
the
decision
by
this
court
in
colgrove
v.
green.
i
think
that
case
is
particularly
important
to
us
today
just
to
remember
what
justice
frankfurter
said
there
as
he
warned
against
a
foray
into
the
political
thicket.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
that
was...
for
the
last
30
years,
your
honor,
this
court
has
navigated
that
political
thicket
through
baker
v.
carr
and
reynolds,
but
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
we're
at
a
fork
in
the
road
where
instead
of
going
through
a
manageable
political
thicket
where
one
person,
one
vote
decisions
are
made
based
on
mathematics,
we
are
standing
at
the
edge
of
a
precipice
where
if
shan
is
applied
like
the
district
court
did
here,
the
standards
of
open-ended
review
of
why
the
legislature
did
this,
why
they
did
that,
the
goodness
or
the
badness
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
particular
reapportionment
decisions,
we
would
respectfully
submit
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
georgia
that
we
have
a
whole
new
kind
and
character
of
political
thicket,
not
like
what
this
court
has
ever
gone
through
before.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
the
difference--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--that
there
was
a
purpose
and
a
goal
of
drawing
a
majority
minority--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--the
only
difference
that
we
have
on
this,
your
honor,
is
whether
that
was
the
predominant
objective.
there
was
indeed
a
purpose
to
draw
that
goal,
but
we
have...
i
think
i
could
not
state
the
argument
better
than
justice
breyer
asked
the
question.
it
is
meaningless
in
these
cases
to
have
a
district
court
try
and
determine
what
the
predominant,
substantial,
significant
type
of
decision
is
on
how
the
lines
are
drawn.
there
was
a
purpose
always
in
this
case.
there
was
a
consensus
politically
before
the
department
of
justice
ever
got
involved
in
the
state
of
georgia
to
try
and
draw
a
majority
minority
district
in
east
central
georgia,
no
question
about
that
fact.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
correct.
in
terms
of
the
second
one,
the
eleventh
district
that
is
at
issue
here,
the
one
that
the
findings
of
the
district
court
are
made
upon
and
the
one
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
are
involved
with,
the
eleventh,
however,
in
that
location
generally,
east
central
georgia,
there
was
indeed
a
consensus
politically
to
have
a
district
of
this
general
location.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
would
have
to
beg
to
differ
with
your
honor's
characterization
of
the
relative
complexity
of
the
two
kinds
of
cases.
this
court
and
the
evidence
in
this
case,
this
court
has
said
any
number
of
times,
and
the
evidence
is
undisputed
if
on
one
point
in
this
case
that
reapportionment
is
the
most
complex,
politically
complex
matter
that
ever
comes
before
a
general
assembly.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
relative
complexity
of
that
and
the
hundreds
of
issues
of
the
236
members
of
the
general
assembly
of
the
state
of
georgia,
the
two
would
pale
by
comparison.
i
think
that
is
the
evidence
in
this
case.
i
don't--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--it
is
unquestionably
at
least
a
whole
order
of
magnitude
much
more
sophisticated
and
much
more
complicated
on
the
first
hand.
on
the
other
hand,
we're
talking
about
politics.
we're
talking
about
that
very
thing
that
should
never
be
in
the
courts
when
it
doesn't
absolutely
have
to
be,
attendance
line
drawing
and
the
judgments
of
the
district
courts
about
the
whys,
the
wherefores,
and
the
wisdom
of
attendance
line
drawing
is
something
that
courts
should,
and
maybe
could,
manage.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well,
that's
what
this
court
held
they
can.
i'm
talking
about
the
relative
ability--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--in
terms
of
politics,
your
honor,
the
critical
distinction
between
this
case
and
what
your
honor
raises
is
this.
the
wall
of
separation
of
our
function
of
government
that
this
court
has
talked
about
for
100
years
is
what
we're
talking
about
crossing
now
when
we
get
into
the
wisdoms,
the
whys,
and
the
wherefores
of
reapportionment
decisions.
if
we're
going
to
make
the
kind
of
open-ended
review
of
reapportionment
decisions
that
was
made
by
this
district
court
in
this
case,
the
wisdom
of
whether
savannah
should
be
coastal
or
whether
it
should
be
part
of
this
district--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
i
think
that's
the
busbee
v.
smith
case
this
court
affirmed
which
we
stand
behind.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
but
no--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--the
court
did
something
about
that.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
those
courts...
first
of
all,
those
cases
had
the
prerequisite
that
helps
you
get
away
from
the
political
complexities
of
harm.
harm
was
proved.
there
is
no
harm
proved
here.
there
is
no
vote
dilution.
there's
no
claim
and
no
evidence
of
any
sort--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
in
the
busbee
case
we're
talking
about
whether
there
was
an
actual
effort
and
an
ability
to
keep
blacks
out
of
office,
but
that--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--i
would
respectfully...
there's
no
question
again,
justice
scalia,
that
there
is
an
element
of...
and
the
purpose,
there
was
a
purpose,
a
goal
to
draw
a
majority
minority
district
here.
what
i
am
taking
about
is
whether
you
can
get
in
there
and
talk
about
the
predominant
purposes,
and
whether
you
can
parse
it
down
and
talk
about
100
legislators.
this
line,
once
you
have
the
overall
objective...
let's,
you
know,
concede
this
at
the
outset.
once
you
have
the
overall
objective
of
creating
a
majority
minority
district,
i'm
not
sure
you
can
say
that
any
segment
or
part
of
that
line
is
indistinct
from
that.
it
does
not
have
some
purpose
in
it.
every
time
you
look
at
a...
this
is
an
1,184
mile
congressional
district
line.
is
there
5
miles
of
it
anywhere
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
race,
given
that
the
overall
purpose
was
in
fact
to
create
a
majority
minority
district?
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
if
you
can...
if
there's
an
answer
to
that.
i'm
not
sure
intellectually
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
answer
to
that
question.
there
are
a
hundred
but-fors
at
every
segment
of
the
line.
but
for
one
person
one
vote,
no
piece
of
the
line
would
be
where
it
was.
but
for
where
counties
are,
no
piece
of
the
line
would
be
where
they
are.
but
for
race
the
line
would
not
be
for
where
it
was.
and
our
difficulty
is
that
the
court,
to
make
those
decisions,
would
be
drawn
in
just
like
it
is.
the
court
here
talks
about
the
majority
of
the
opinion
talks
about
how
it
would
be
better
to
have
savannah
being
part
of
the
coastal
district,
and
the
distinction
between
the
majority
and
the
dissent
i
think
shows
up
quite
clearly
what
the
court's
choices
in
this
case
were.
judge
edmondson
writes
in
dissent,
i
don't
think
we
should
be
getting
into
the
minds
of
legislators
like
that.
i
don't
think
we
should
be
making
judgments
about
what
is
good
or
bad
about
reapportionment,
and
the
thing
that
we
are
distinguishing
between
school
desegregation
in
other
cases
is,
where
politics
are
the
issue,
as
they
are
in
this
case,
that
is
the
single
most
important
area
where
this
court
chould
tread
only
at
the
very--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--we
don't
think
what
your
honor
just
stated
is
part
of
section
5
or
section
2,
so
i
guess--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--i
think
that
would
not
be
appropriate,
certainly
under--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--the
statutory
framework.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
the
statutes
don't
require
that.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
neither
section
2
nor
section
5
require
it.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
think
it
would
very
much
depend
on
the
particular
facts
of
the
particular
case.
maximization--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--if
it
was
nothing
but
maximization,
without
regard
to
any
other
considerations,
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
because
that
at
some
point
would
get...
it
would
violate
shaw.
shaw
as
we
see
it--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--what
see
in
shaw,
i
suggest,
and
we
don't
see
it,
we
don't
read
it,
and
we
hope
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
cannot
have
the
goal
of
a
majority
minority
district
for
the
purpose,
given
the
facts
of
georgia,
and
those
facts
in
a
nutshell
are
the
reality
of
having
black
people
elected
to
office.
the
general
assembly
in
georgia
when
it
did
this
reapportionment
had
a
simple
choice.
we
will
draw
districts
to
have
blacks
elected,
or
we
won't.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
where
it
is
done
without
regard
to
anything
else
whatsoever
is
what
i
was
going
to
say.
in
other
words,
in
our
case
we
have
taken,
and
out
of
the
1,184-mile
district
boundary,
71
percent
of
that
follows
the
state
boundary,
county
boundaries,
and
city
boundaries.
the
great
bulk
of
the
remaining
29
percent
follow
precinct
boundaries--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
we're
saying
this,
your
honor,
and
nothing
more
than
this.
we're
saying
that
to
apply
shaw
and
to
reach
that
question
about
what
is
permissible
and
what
is
not
permissible
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
respectfully
urge
this
court
as
most
strenuously
as
we
can
to
try
and
draw
an
objective
set
of
standards
to
implement
the
shaw
case
rather
than
this
generalized
subjective
intent
thing,
rather
than
a
generalized
review
of
the
goodness
or
the
badness
of
the
redistricting
decisions
of
the--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--your
honor,
we
would
certainly
urge
the
court
to
stay
away
from
shape
as
a
talisman
where
it's
the
eye
of
the
beholder
type
of
shape,
does
it
look
good,
does
it
look
bad.
what
we
think
and
what
we
urge
the
court
is,
where
the
district
line
is
predominantly
composed
and
based
upon
the
kind
of
county
boundary,
state
boundary,
city
boundaries,
and
the
precinct
lines
then
is
the
last
remaining
part,
that
are
locally
determined
based
on
geographical
markers,
major
highways,
roads,
and
so
on,
that's
an
objective
standard,
that
we
say
that
is
where
the
line
should
be
drawn,
and
that's
where
we
say
it's
the
most
appropriate
way
because
that
will
not
draw
the
courts
into
the
political
thicket
any
deeper
than
they
otherwise
have
to
be.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
that
person's
out
of
court,
your
honor,
and
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law
when
you're
following
the
existing
lines
that
have
been
drawn
for
other
purposes,
that
is
by--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--no,
not
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form,
your
honor,
and
for
this
reason--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
this
is
the
reason
why.
that
requires
proof
of
harm.
it's
a
totally
different
case.
a
packing
case
would
be
very
difficult
to
prove.
as
your
honor
mentioned
in
the
johnson,
and
discussed
in
the
johnson
v.
de
grandy
case,
this
court
has,
and
for
good
reason,
shown
a
much
greater
reluctance
to
get
into
how
should
particular
lines
be
drawn
rather
than
multi-member
versus
single
member
challenges.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
for
shaw
cases.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
for
shaw
cases,
bizarreness
is
the
threshold.
for
a
packing
case,
that's
a
totally
different
matter.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
they
are,
but
the
elements
of
them
and
what
they
constitute
are
different
as
we
read
that
jurisprudence.
that
is...
those
are
harm
cases,
gingles...
packing,
and
of
course,
the
court
never
found
a
packing
case
to
my
knowledge,
has
ever
found
proof
of
one.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well,
there
is
no
proof
of
harm
in
a
shaw
case
as
i
understand
the
shaw
theory.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
your
honor,
i
think
i
must
have
misspoken
myself,
because
we're
not
saying
that
the
proof
of
harm
is
essential
to
the
shaw
case
as
that...
as
we're
reading
that
case.
i
was
trying
to
distinguish
how
you
prove
a
shaw
case
from
how
you
deal
with
a
packing
case
and
i
was
drawing
a
distinction,
saying
that
in
a
packing
case
the
element
of
harm
must
be
proved,
harm
in
the
sense
of
diminishment,
purposeful
diminishment.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well,
we
would
say
that
that
is
an
objective
standard
where
there
is...
the
lines
are
first
of
all
drawn
for
a
purpose
to
create
a
majority
minority
district,
but
then
in
terms
of
the
objective--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--no,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
think
the
thicket
of
how
much
purpose
goes
into
each
part
of
the
line,
whether
it's
a
good
reapportionment
decision
is
a
thicket
that
i...
we
urge
the
court
not
to
get
into,
and
i
think
that
the
objective
standards
we're
talking
about,
the
objective
standards
as
to
the
extent
to
which
the
district
line
in
fact
follows
traditional
boundaries,
geographical
markers
and
physical
features
and
major
highways,
that
is
the
kind
of
objective
standard
that
makes
a
decision
of
a
district
court
number
1
predictable
so
the
legislature
can
know
in
advance
what
do
we
have
to
do
and
what
can't
we
do?
number
2,
it
ensures
that
the
district
court
adjudication
process
is
predictable,
and
i
think
that's
of
critical
importance,
because
there's
two
sides...
the
two
sides
to
the
separation
of
powers
question
are,
1)
the
legislature
is
entitled
to
have
their
reapportionment
prerogatives.
politics
belong
in
the
courts.
the
other
thing
is,
it
is
inevitable
in
our
judgment,
and
i
think
justice
powell
was
the
one
that
wrote
so
eloquently
about
this
is,
if
the
courts
start
making
these
kinds
of
judgments,
the
integrity
of
the
courts
will
be
perceived
by
the
people
to
be
jeopardized.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
we
would--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--we
had
that
system
of
government
in
georgia
for
some
time,
justice
scalia.
we
had
all
white
districts
and
black
people
weren't
very
happy
under
that
process.
we
had
a
majority--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--with
all
due
respect,
no
one
had
to
commission
a
study.
the
political
process
made
that
judgment,
which
is
the
appropriate
way
for
that
judgment
to
be
made
in
the
reapportionment
process,
and
if
i
might--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--justice
scalia--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--we
have
236
representative
and
senate
districts
in
our
general
assembly.
of
those,
there
is
one
that
has
elected
a
black
person.
181
of
those
236,
justice
scalia--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
it
may
be
compelling.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
would
put
a
great
more
judgment
and
worth
in
the
testimony
of
the
black
people
who
testified
in
this
case
than
a
study
one
might
hire
a
university
professor
to
do.
i
would
put
a
great
deal
more
credence
in
the
number
of
elected
black
officials
who
have
been
elected
under
single
member
district
plans
where
the
majority
black
members--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--and
their
constituents.
excuse
me.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
if
the
equal
protection
clause
in
this
country
were
construed
so
that
it
was
prohibited
to
have
majority
minority
districts,
which
would
empirically
mean
that
the
delegation
in
georgia
would
revert
to
all
white
like
it
was
in
the
old
days,
that
would
be
a
construction
of
the
equal
protection
clause
that
i
think
would
stand
the
history
and
the
purpose
of
that
clause
and
the
civil
war
itself
on
its
head.
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
your
honor,
i
would...
that's
part
of
it.
i
would
say
there's
something
even
more
important
than
that,
justice
stevens,
and
i
think
instead
of
looking
at
the
past
history,
let's
look
at
the
present
reality
and
the
empirical
facts:
181
districts
in
georgia
are
majority
white
in
the
general
assembly,
house
and
senate
combined.
one
of
those
181
at
the
time
of
trial
had
a
black
person
representing
it.
that
tells
us
that
if
we're
going
to
have
an
integrated
congressional
delegation
we're
going
to
do
it
through
this
technique,
period.
that
is
georgia's
justification.
that's
why
it
did
it,
and
we
advocate
that
that
is
totally
significant,
adequate,
and
sufficient
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
the
constitution--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--the
constitution
says
this,
your
honor.
it
only
prohibits
the
states
from
doing
certain
things.
it
does
not
mandate,
and
in
its
prohibitions--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--and
making
a
decision
that
we
should
have
an
integrated
delegation
rather
than
a
segregated
one
is
one
that
is
a
legitimate
decision
that
falls
within
the
ambit,
and
is
permitted
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
that's
all
we're
saying.
we're
not
saying
that
the
state
was
mandated
to
do
this.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
we-re
saying--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--we're
saying
to
construe
the
constitution
in
the
opposite
direction
to
prohibit
what
the
state
did,
that's
our
problem.
we
think
that
would
be
inappropriate.
if
i
may
reserve
the
last--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--seconds--
