mr.
a.
lee
parks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
that
the
eleventh
congressional
district
was
an
intentional
racial
gerrymander
that
is
at
constitutional
odds
with
the
equal
protection
jurisprudence
of
this
court.
all
parties
in
this
case
i
think
would
agree
with
this
opening
premise:
race-based
remedies
are
a
constitutional
evil
that
will
be
condoned
only
on
a
limited
basis,
and
if
they're
temporary.
we
have
fallen
in
love
with
the
assumption
that
race-based
is
remedial,
and
in
this
case
the
illness
was
not
defined
before
the
remedy
was
assumed.
the
real
world
of
this
case
is
beyond
much
of
what
we
have
talked
about
here
today.
the
real
world
of
this
case
is
simple,
and
put
forward
in
length
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
the
state
of
georgia
was
confronted
with
a
regional
plan
of
the
department
of
justice
that
required
maximization
of
black
voting
strength
based
upon
a
heretofore
unavailable
technology.
that
technology
allowed
reapportionment
to
be
done
at
a
census
block
level
with
such
scalpel-like
precision
that
the
races
could
be
separated
to
achieve
particular
racial
percentages.
not
only
within
the
district,
but
because
of
that
precision,
the
department
of
justice
made
the
assumption
that
the
voting
rights
act
requires
racial
proportionality
within
the
districts.
that
is
the
only
explanation
for
why
georgia
would
have
been
required
to
rip
out
the
core
of
two
traditionally
established
districts
and
to
change
from
what
they
originally
proposed
to
what
ended
up
as
the
georgia
districting
plan.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
i
think
the
court
in
the
first
hays
opinion
dealt
with
your
honor's
hypothetical,
and
the
court
made,
i
think,
the
appropriate
distinction
between
motive
and
intent.
it
may
well
be
that
a
motive
would
be,
we
want
to
increase
the
democratic
strength
of
a
particular
district,
but
if
the
intent
was
to
strictly
use
racial
classifications,
then
i
think--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--i
think
because
it
employs
racial
classifications,
whether...
now,
the
state
would
come
in
and
say...
at
least
you
would
move
to
direct
scrutiny
because
it
employed
the
racial
classification.
i
don't
think
that
the
desires
of
the
democratic
party
rise
to
the
level
of
a
compelling
state
interest--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--that...
the
direct
answer
is,
that's
not
going
to
avoid
the
traditional
strict
scrutiny
analysis,
and
if
you
get
into
that,
i
think
that
the
political
issue
is
not
going
to
rise
to
the
level
of
a
compelling
state
interest
that
would
allow
that
type
of
districting
to
succeed.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
no,
justice
breyer.
i
think
that...
i
think
your
hypothetical
takes
it
a
step
further.
as
i
understood
justice
thomas',
there
was
only
one
consideration,
that
these
black
voters
were
going
to
be
moved.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
if
we
begin
to
broaden
the
spectrum
of
consideration,
then
i
think
that
it
becomes
a
more
difficult
question.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
right.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
in
looking
at
that
question,
i
went
back
to
the
oral
argument
that
was
presented
to
this
court
in
shaw
v.
reno
to
see
if
the
court
engaged
in
any
discussion
of
that.
there
is
only
a
single
question
in
response
on
whether
the
shape
of
the
district
would
either
be
an
element
or
some
some
threshold
test
or
merely
evidence
of
racial
classifications.
justice
o'connor
asked
the
question
at
page
38
of
the
transcript,
i
guess
you
would
agree
that
district
12
is
a
highly
irregular
shape.
do
you
think
that
districts
such
as
that
could
be,
in
and
of
itself,
some
evidence
of
an
invidious
intent,
and
the
state
of
north
carolina
agreed.
i
have
always
assumed
that
we
would
never
create
some
type
of
a
threshold
that
would
be
visual
in
nature
that
might,
in
fact,
mask
more
sophisticated--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--of
racially
gerry--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--right.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
your
honor,
the...
there's
one
additional
fact
i
don't
know
if
your
honor
has
included,
but
when
we
talk
about
visual,
there
are
two
maps
you
have
to
look
at.
you
cannot
just
look
at
the
map
that
shows
in
macro
form
the
geographical
boundaries
of
the
district.
no
matter
how
irregular
and
how
elongated
their
appendages,
they
might
just
show
that
a
municipality
was
on
that
appendage.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
well,
but
then
maybe,
but
if
we
have
just
this
specific
claim,
voters
contending
that
there
has
been
intentional
racial
classifications
that
has
resulted
in
a
gerrymandered
district,
but
we're
not
allowed
to
look
past
the
visual
to
juxtapose
the
race
map
to
see
that
these
lines
are
drawn--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--and
i
would
agree
with
that,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
the
end-all.
for
example,
in
this
case
we
have
not
only
the
bizarre
shape
of
this
district
compared
to
the
past
districting
principles,
but
we
also
have
facts
as
found
by
the
district
court
that
this
entire
districting
plan
was
driven
by
proportionality,
and
that
proportionality
far
exceeded
the
racial
and
geographic
demographics
of
this
state
to
sustain
it.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
is
the
essence
of
shaw
v.
reno.
i
think
what
shaw
v.
reno
is
trying
to
give
us
is
an
operative
way
of
dealing
with
these
cases.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
well,
i
would
assume
that
if
there
has
been
a
gerrymander
it
is
not
a
past
practice,
it
is
an
aberration
from
past
practices.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
well,
they
haven't
in
georgia.
we
have--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor,
because
it
then
allows
racial...
it
allows
racial
gerrymanders
to
escape
the
strict
scrutiny
that
this
court
wants
to
apply,
and
i
think--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--well,
i
didn't
view
that
as
the
end-all
of
the
case.
i
viewed
that
that
would
be,
again,
some
evidence
that
there
exists
a
racial
gerrymander.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
exactly.
you
don't.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
and
we
have
that
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
right.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
the
answer
that
the
district
court
had
to
that
problem,
your
honor,
was
elevating
the
standard,
and
i
think
it
made
an
intentional
elevation
from
the
arlington
heights
standard
to
a
higher
standard
in
recognition
that
reapportionment
is
a
legislative
act
where
race
is
frequently
taken
into
consideration.
"predominant
and
overriding",
in
the
words
of
our
court,
created
a
demonstrably
higher
standard
than
i
think
the
one
that
the
justice
is
concerned
about.
i
do
think
that
that
higher
standard
was
a
reasoned
choice
by
the
district
court
that
spoke
to
that
issue,
and
i
disagree
with
the
appellants
that
predominant
intent
is
some
unworkable,
unmanageable
standard
that
courts
can't
deal
with.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
in
terms
of
the
potential
litigation
that
either
test
might
generate?
mr.
a.
lee
parks
i
think
that
if
you're
talking
about
bizarreness
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--that
could
be
any--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--but
that
ultimately
becomes
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder.
i
mean,
everyone
can
look
at
a
map
and
see
their
own
animal,
just
like
you
look
at
the
clouds,
but
hard
and
fast
evidence
of
intent
is
hard
to
prove.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
right.
but
i
submit
to
you
that
visual
versus
the
burden
that
the
district
court
placed
on
us
of
showing
that
the
united
states
department
of
justice
drove
this
plan
to
the
point
of
irrationality--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--that
that
evidence
is
so
overwhelming--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--yes.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
i'm
not--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--i
think
not.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
because
i--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--first
of
all...
let's
back
up.
these
districts
were
drawn
before
shaw.
this
was
a
legislature
that
assumed
that
all
districts
possible
was
the
law.
this
legislature
now
has
that.
they
are
going
to
be
able
to
conduct
legislative
hearings
when
they
put
these
districts
together
that
make
sure
that
there
are
other
considerations.
they
will
create
their
legislative
record
which
will
insulate
the
district,
and
if
they
don't,
they
should
be
challenged.
this
is
a
pre-shaw
prototype,
where
they
couldn't
do
it
and
they
were
open
and
honest
about
what
they
were
doing,
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--your
honor,
that
is
not
far
off
the
point.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
i
think
that
if
you're
talking
about,
in
your
honor's
question,
a
bizarre
shape,
yes,
i
do,
because
the
only
thing
that
i
can--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--right.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
if
you
all
continue
to
believe
that
ujo
is
the
law,
then
that
is
not
barred
from
constitutional
permissibility.
if
you're
meeting
sound
districting
principles--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--i
think
it
depends
upon
the
extent
to
which
there
is
a
community.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
the
only
reason--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--the
only
reason
that
i
hesitate
is
that
the
community
of
interest
that
was
sought
to
be
put
forward
in
our
case
was
pure
race,
and
as
i
understand
in
your
honor's
hypothetical
you're
going
beyond
that,
and
if
you
go
beyond
that,
and
it's
not
race-based--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--yes,
because...
i
think
it
would,
because
race
has
fallen
out
of
the
mix
in
terms
of
predominant
characteristic
here.
you're
talking
about
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
race.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
well,
your
honor,
this
is
a
case
that
we
got
done
in
about
a
week,
and
the
state
never
really--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--well,
i
don't
know
if
it
will
even
need
to
be
done
then,
because
what
we'd
be
facing
then
is
a
legislature
that
made
a
reasoned
judgment
and
made
sure
that
it
did
not
violate
those
tenets.
that
is
an
overwhelming
burden
that
a
plaintiff
is
going
to
have.
not
only
do
we
have--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--right.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
no,
obviously
not,
but
again,
i
would
assume,
hearkening
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
earlier
on,
there
would
be
a
study
or
some
basis
for
that,
and
that
we
would
then,
as
plaintiffs,
evaluate
that
and
determine
whether
this
is
pretext
or
whether...
i
mean,
race
cases
in
employment
law,
in
contracting
law,
in
admissions
to
colleges,
we
all...
they
all
deal
with
these
issues,
and
we
don't
say
that
we're
going
to
ignore
quotas
at
a
university,
or
we're
going
to
ignore
quotas
on
public
contracting
because
the
give-and-take
of
a
political
fight
might
make
uncovering
the
racial
animus
that
drives
those
programs
difficult.
we
elevate
the
burden
of
proof
to
plaintiffs
because
it's
reapportionment,
but
we
don't
close
the
courthouse
door
because
it
may
be
bothersome.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
you
say
by
precincts?
mr.
a.
lee
parks
right.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
no.
no,
race
did
not
predominate.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
it's
similar
to
drawing
our
fifth
congressional
district.
you
would
draw
our
fifth
congressional
district--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--your
honor,
we
are
very
naive
in
about
political--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--gerrymandering
in
georgia.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
but
i
would
assume
that
would
be
a
good
way
to
do
it,
and
the
further
reason
i
say
that
is
this.
the
computer...
i
have
seen
this
computer.
we
bought
this
computer
that
does
this
work,
and
it
sat
on
the
bench
at
this
trial,
and
this
computer
can
bring
that
information
up
just
like
that,
show
you
the
precinct,
show
you
the
last
election,
and
you
can
draw
that
democratic
precinct
anywhere
you
want,
and
you
can
do
that
independent
of
race.
then
you
can
overlay
race.
then
you
can
overlay
any,
and
unbelievable
amounts
of
demographic
information.
it
truly
is
the
big
brother
of
government,
and
that
technology
has
led
us
into
this
abyss.
that...
the
law
has
got
to
catch
up
with
the
technology.
legislatures
now--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--huh?
mr.
a.
lee
parks
i
don't...
i
can't
conceive
that
they
could
do
it
with
the
surgeon-like
precision
we
can
do
it
now.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
i
stand
corrected.
let
me
read
to
you
what
the
state
of
georgia
said
2
weeks
before
it
gave
in
and
threw
its
towel
in,
what
it
said
to
a
federal
district
court
when
faced
with
a
department
of
justice
demand
that
three
districts
be
created.
this
is
on
page
22,
footnote
22
of
our
brief:
"this
plan
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
a
complaint
that
the
state
should
have
but
has
not
sought
proportional
representation
for
minority
citizens
as
a
goal.
"
the
state
went
on
to
lambast
the
department
of
justice
as
asking
for
not
only
unprecedented
but
a
dangerous
plan
regarding
the
political
proces
of
this
nation.
it
then
contended
that
the
plan,
as
it
was
ultimately
passed,
would
cause
racial
polarization
and
encourage
candidates
of
one
race
to
be
unresponsive
to
the
needs
and
wishes
of
another
race,
thereby
breeding
extremism
in
both
races
to
the
detriment
of
all
citizens.
a
max
black's
plan,
which
was
the
proponent
and
the
blueprint
for
their
plan,
in
the
opinion
of
the
state
2
weeks
before
they
accepted
it,
"will
most
certainly
have
the
effect
and
result
of
diminishing
minority
effectiveness
in
the
political
process...
diminishing
minority
effectiveness
in
the
political
process.
"
mr.
a.
lee
parks
they're
here
defending
it
today,
but
i
submit
to
you
that
the
record
is
overwhelmingly
clear
that
that
is
out
of
expedience
rather
than
any
compelling
state
justification.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
yes,
but
the
state...
in
that
case,
they
sought
through
section
2
to
have
these
three
minority
districts
drawn.
the
state
was
defending
it
and
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
case,
and
those
quotes
are
from
the
state's
brief
opposing
the
implementation
of
the
plan.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
yes,
but
that
plan
is
seeking
to
have
the
department
of
justice
mandate
made
the
law
through
section
2.
the
state
of
georgia
admits
that
the
voting
rights
act
could
not
stand
as
a
compelling
state
interest
for
this
plan.
when
you
remove
the
voting
rights
act
from
this
type
of
racial
gerrymandering,
what
else
is
there?
what
else
could
there
be?
the
state
says,
a
fair
shot.
a
fair
shot
is
code
for
proportionality,
because
proportionality
is
all
they
argued
at
the
district
court.
they
read
de
grandy
as
sanctioning
proportionality,
and
i
read--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--that
opinion
very
differently.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
yes,
that
would
become...
but
then
we
would
go
into
traditional
equal
protection
analysis.
have
you,
the
state
of
georgia,
come
up
with
a
limited
race-based
remedy,
temporary
in
nature,
and
narrowly
tailored
to
the
purpose.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
it
can't
just
automatically
be
proportionality.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
right.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
right.
but
we
get
to
the
point,
they're
not
contending
that.
they
are
contending
that
proportionality
in
and
of
itself
is
a
state
sovereign
legislative
prerogative
that
they
don't...
that
they...
they're
asking
this
court
to
politely
butt
out.
they're
saying
to
the
courts
of
the
united
states
that
we
want,
under
some
states'
rights
theory,
the
right,
even
though
we
really
did
this
because
the
justice
department
made
us
do
it,
we
have
to
defend
it,
and
what
we
want
to
say
is,
is
that
if
we
want
to
manipulate
racially
our
political
boundaries,
it's
no
business
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
if
that
is
the
only--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--i
would
hope
not,
justice
stevens.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
no,
i
hope
that
would
not
be
constitutional.
that
was
the
only
expressed
reason...
no
communities
of
interest,
no
nothing.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
right.
mr.
a.
lee
parks
and
that's
why
strict
scrutiny
helps
us
with
this.
it
makes--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--shaw
says
racial
or
ethnic
enclaves.
are
these
not
ethnic
enclaves,
and
is
an
ethnic
enclave
somehow
more
constitutional
than
a
racial
enclave?
we
read...
we
don't
read
a
distinction
in
the
shaw
case.
if
you
are
separating
people
because
of
their
race,
and
ethnicity
is
certainly
a
subcategory
of
race,
i
want
the
state
to
have
to
go
through
the
hoops.
it
may
well
get
through
it,
because
it
will
show
that
when
we
go
into
chinatown,
the
signs
are
all
in
chinese,
and
everyone
worships
a
different
god,
and
these
people
have
genuine,
independent
community-based
needs
to
have
a
political
voice
that
is
weighted
in
a
plethora
of
other
interests,
rather
than--
mr.
a.
lee
parks
--thank
you.
