justice
david
h.
souter
--there
certainly
wasn't
a
consensus
to
draw
a
third
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
if
the
lines
in
fact
are
conveniently
drawn
precisely
as
you
say.
they
follow
various
political
boundaries,
and
a
plaintiff
who
is
a
member
of
the
district
in
question
comes
in
and
says,
yes,
they
were
lucky,
they
had
these
boundaries,
but
in
fact
the
only
motivation
behind
the
drawing
of
these
lines
was
simply
to
find
a
set
of
lines
that
would
give
a
majority
minority
district
when
there
in
fact
is
no
justification
for
it.
is
that
person
out
of
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
in
effect
you're
telling
us
that
the
old
jurisprudence
of
dilution
is
in
fact
to
be
thrown
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
that
my
mythical
plaintiff
in
my
hypo
comes
in
and
says
that
was
their
predominant
purpose,
and
in
fact
the
result
and
the
intent
was
racial
packing.
you're
saying,
i
thought,
he's
out
of
court.
if
he's
out
of
court,
then
at
least
one
category
of
traditional
dilution
jurisprudence
is
overruled.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
are
you
saying
that
the...
i
thought
in
your
brief
you
thought
there
was
something
to
the
notion
that
bizarreness
would
be
the
threshold.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
really
saying
it's
not
bizarreness,
it's
harm?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
shaw
cases
and
packing
cases
are
all
fourteenth
amendment
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
would
the
harm
be
in
a
so-called
shaw
case
that
would
not
also
constitute
harm
under
the
old
line
of
packing...
the
old
line
of
dilution
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i'm
just
asking
your
position.
if
harm
is,
in
fact,
going
to
be
the
criterion,
and
bizarreness
is
to
be
identified
by
harm,
what
kind
of
harm
would
qualify
that
would
not
also
have
qualified
under
the
old
dilution
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then,
do
we
then
come
back
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
so-called
shaw
case
if,
and
only
if,
the
lines
are
drawn
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
respect
preexisting
political
boundaries?
is
that
the
essence
of
the
shaw
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
what
is
grotesque
is
a
question
of
purpose--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i
thought
a
moment
ago
you
were
saying
that
purpose
is
a
thicket
we'd
better
not
get
into.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
wasn't
there
also
evidence
that
community
of
interest
or
no
community
of
interest,
the
only
reason
this
was
done
was
that
the
justice
department
was
demanding
a
third
district,
time
was
growing
short,
you
didn't
want
to
take
your
chances
and
perhaps,
indeed,
didn't
have
time,
or
the
state
didn't,
in
the
district
of
columbia
court,
and
so
that
in
fact
something
was
being
done
here
differently
for
blacks
from
anything
that
would
have
been
done
from
any
other
identifiable
group,
and
that
in
effect
was
to
say,
we
surrender
to
the
justice
department.
your
demand
is
going
to
carry
the
day.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
was
certainly
an
evidentiary
basis
for
the
judge
to
find
that,
wasn't
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
and
indeed--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
will
assume
that
that
was
error,
but
even
on
your
own
criterion,
wasn't
the...
wasn't
there
also
an
evidentiary
basis
for
the
court
to
do
what
it
did?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
wasn't
the
evidence
equally
clear
that
georgia
was
in
fact
not
applying
them
here,
that
georgia
had
no
intention
to
apply
them
to
create
a
third
district,
and
the
only
reason
the
third
district
was
created
was
that
the
justice
department
was
demanding
it
and
time
was
running
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
all
you're
saying...
all
you're
saying,
i
think,
is
that
the
so-called
visual
test,
the
bizarreness
test,
will
not,
in
fact,
smoke
out
everything
that
is
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
think
general
days
was
very
clear
in
answering
me
that
that
is
not
his
position.
he's
saying
that
that
is
a
sufficient
test
to
identify
a
case
in
which
there
should
be
strict
scrutiny.
he
is
also,
i
think,
clearly
saying
that
the
other
tests,
those
tests,
for
example,
that
we
have
identified
for
a
traditional
dilution
jurisprudence,
are
still
there,
so
that
in
the
point
that
you
made
that
we
might,
in
fact,
have
a
nonbizarre
district
which
nonetheless
masked
quite
invidiously
intentional
discrimination,
they're
not
saying
that
you
can't
look
at
that.
they're
simply
saying
that
you
have
to
state
a
different
kind
of
claim,
e.g.,
a
packing
claim,
whatever
it
might
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
you
are
allowed
to
look
beyond
it,
but
if
you
want
to
look
beyond
it
for
purposes
other
than
bringing
what
i
will
call
a
bizarreness
shaw
claim,
you've
got
to
allege
those
kinds
of
harms,
for
example,
i.e.,
those
are
your
thresholds
that
are
identified
with
dilution,
and
there
may
be
other
reasons,
too,
but
that
would
be
one
reason,
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
would
be
one
answer
that
you
could
give
to
justice
breyer.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
where
does
your
answer
leave
you
in
response
to
the
question,
is
everything,
in
fact,
going
to
qualify
for
attack,
because
the
shaw
bizarreness
criterion
says
look,
there
is
a
point
at
which
the
consideration
of
race
may
indeed
become
just
outrageous.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
accept
the
fact
that
some
considerations
of
race
are
necessary.
i
mean,
you
can't
be
blind
when
you
draw
the
line.
some
are
outrageous.
the
traditional
dilution
jurisprudence
says
well,
we
identify
certain
kinds
of
harms
as
triggering
a
cause
of
action,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
were
saying
well,
we're
not
going
to
depend
on
bizarreness,
and
we're
not
going
to
depend
on
the
kind
of
dilution
harms,
and
doesn't
that
leave
you
as
saying,
whenever
you
consider
it
for
any
purpose,
which
in
fact
is
always,
because
you
can't
district
without
taking
it
into
consideration
somehow,
it's
going
to
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny,
and
therefore
every
single
districting
decision
in
a
multiracial
district
is
at
least
going
to
get
you
into
court.
how
do
you
avoid...
what
is
your
answer
to
that
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
any
way
to
comment
on...
and
maybe
there
isn't,
but
is
there
any
way
to
comment
on
the
likelihood
that
the
predominance
standard
is
in
fact
going
to
raise
a
series
of
claims
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
in
greater
numbers
than
the
bizarreness
threshold
would
do?
how
do
we
compare
those
two?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they're
saying
bizarreness
in
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--bizarreness
in
the
eye
of
history
is
what
they're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you've
got
to
find
an
animal
in
the
past,
too,
and
that
makes
it
a
little
harder.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
may
be,
but
that...
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
unduly--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
that
gets
it
to
a
pretty
fact-specific
point.
how,
as
a
general
criterion,
would
we
compare
what
predominant
purpose
and
bizarre
district
would
result
in?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
we
going
to
get
a
lot
more
cases
on
predominant
purpose
than
there
would--
justice
david
h.
souter
--be
on
bizarre
district?
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
not,
why
not
stick
with
bizarre
district?
