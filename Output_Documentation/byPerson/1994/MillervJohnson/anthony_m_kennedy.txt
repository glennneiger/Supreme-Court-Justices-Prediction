suppose
you're
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
do
you
have
a
constitutional
obligation
to
refrain
from
telling
the
state,
do
everything
you
can
to
create
majority
minority
districts
to
the
maximum
amount
possible?
justice
anthony
m.

i'm
asking
whether
or
not
it's
consistent
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
equal
protection
clause
for
the
attorney
general
of
che
united
states
to
direct
a
state
to
proceed
as
i've
indicated.
justice
anthony
m.

why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why?
why
wouldn't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--pardon
me?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
statute
did
permit
the
attorney
general
to
do
that,
would
there
be
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
facts
of
the
case
are
maximization
for
maximization's
sake.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
is
the
principle
of
shaw
that
would
be
violated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
acknowledge
that
at
some
point
it's
a
violation
of
the
constitution--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
direct
racial
districting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
assume
in
answering
my
question
that
there's
a
constitutional
violation,
that
the
constitution
means
something.
it
stands
for
protecting
a
significant
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
telling
us
that
it's
beyond
judicial
capacity
to
protect
that
significant
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
justice
department
said
that
as
a
matter
of
preclearance
policy
we
will
litigate
with
you
unless
you
maximize
all
black
districts,
would
that
raise
constitutional
concerns?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
you
draw
as
many
majority
black
districts
as
you
possibly
can
within
the
population.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
that...
if
that
were
the
policy,
would
it
raise
constitutional
concerns?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
miller
versus
georgia
and
the
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
georgia’s
most
recent
congressional
redistricting
plan.
the
1990
census
gave
georgia
an
additional
congressional
seat,
increasing
it's
delegation
from
ten
to
eleven.
the
state
legislature
enacted
a
new
districting
plan.
under
the
old
plan
there
had
been
one
majority-black
district
that
is
to
say
a
district
in
which
the
majority
of
voters
were
black.
under
the
new
plan
as
first
enacted
by
the
general
assembly
to
reflect
the
additional
seat.
there
would
be
two
majority-black
districts,
georgia
is
a
covered
jurisdiction
under
the
voting
rights
act
so
it
was
required
to
submit
his
new
redistricting
plans,
either
to
the
justice
department
or
to
united
states
district
court
before
the
plan
could
go
into
effect.
georgia
twice
submitted
the
proposed
redistricting
plan
to
the
justice
department
and
the
justice
department
twice
objected
on
the
ground
that
georgia
had
created
only
two
majority-black
districts
when
they
conceivably
could
have
created
three.
the
justice
department
relied
on
a
plan
advocated
by
the
aclu
and
referred
to
as
the
max-black
plan
which
would
have
created
three
majority-black
districts
in
georgia.
understanding
that
the
justice
department
would
not
preclear
any
proposed
plan,
until
it
created
three
majority-black
districts,
georgia’s
general
assembly
redrew
the
district-lines,
to
create
the
third
majority-black
district
and
it
finally
obtained
justice
department
approval.
the
key
to
the
approved
plan
was
the
eleventh
district,
the
dense
majority-black
populations
centers
of
atlanta,
augusta
and
savannah
were
appended
to
a
sparsely
populated
rural
core
in
order
to
create
the
district.
after
the
1992
elections
voters
from
the
eleventh
district
brought
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
georgia,
alleging
that
there
district
was
a
racial
gerrymander
and
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
the
district
court
agreed.
now,
the
district
court
cited
evidence
of
the
legislative
purpose
as
well
as
several
appendages
drawn
for
the
obvious
purpose
of
putting
black
population
into
the
eleventh
district.
the
court
found
that
race
was
the
overriding,
predominant
factor
in
the
redistricting
process,
it
further
concluded
that
georgia’s
plan
could
not
satisfy
strict
scrutiny,
the
rigorous
standard
by
which
we
judge
all
racial
classifications.
today,
in
an
opinion
by
the
court
we
affirm
the
district
court.
two
terms
ago,
we
decided
in
shaw
v.
reno
that
if
plaintiff
states
a
claim
under
the
equal
protection
clause
by
alleging
that
a
district
is
so
bizarre
on
its
face
that
it
is
unexplainable
other
than
by
race.
we
held
that
in
such
cases
the
plan
could
be
upheld
only
if
it
satisfies
strict
scrutiny.
our
holding
in
shaw
did
not
erect
an
artificial
rule
divorced
from
its
general
principals
of
equal
protection
analysis.
shape
is
relevant
not
because
bizarreness
is
a
necessary
element
of
the
constitutional
wrong
or
a
threshold
requirement
of
proof.
the
district
shape
is
relevant
because
it
may
be
persuasive
circumstantial
evidence
that
race
for
its
own
sake,
and
not
other
districting
principles,
was
the
legislature's
dominant
and
controlling
rationale
in
drawing
its
district
lines.
the
logical
implication,
as
the
courts
applying
shaw
have
recognized,
is
that
parties
may
rely
on
evidence
other
than
bizarreness
to
establish
racebased
districting.
he
plaintiff's
burden
is
to
show,
either
through
circumstantial
evidence
of
a
district's
shape
and
demographics
or
by
more
direct
evidence
going
to
legislative
purpose,
that
race
was
the
predominant
factor
motivating
a
legislature's
decision
to
place
a
significant
number
of
voters
within
or
without
a
particular
district.
to
make
this
showing,
a
plaintiff
must
prove
that
the
legislature
subordinated
traditional
race-neutral
districting
principles
to
racial
considerations.
where
these
or
other
race-neutral
considerations
are
the
basis
for
redistricting
legislation,
and
are
not
subordinated
to
race,
a
state
can
"defeat
a
claim
that
a
district
has
been
gerrymandered
on
racial
lines."
the
district
court
here
finds
that
it
was
exceedingly
obvious
both
from
the
shape
of
the
eleventh
district
and
from
the
wealth
of
other
evidence
that
race
was
the
predominant
factor
in
drawing
the
electoral
district.
in
fact
the
state
of
georgia
admits
in
his
brief
of
the
eleventh
district
is
the
product
of
a
desire
to
create
a
majority-black
district.
on
this
record,
we
fail
to
see
how
the
district
court
could
have
reached
any
conclusion
other
than
that
race
was
the
predominant
factor
in
drawing
georgia's
eleventh
district;
and
in
any
event
we
conclude
the
court's
finding
is
not
clearly
erroneous.
we
agree
also
with
the
district
court
that
georgia’s
plan
cannot
survive
strict
scrutiny.
whether
or
not
in
some
case
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act,
standing
alone
can
provide
compelling
interest
independent
of
any
interest
and
remedying
past
discrimination,
it
cannot
do
so
here.
the
congressional
plan
challenged
here
was
not
required
by
the
voting
rights
act
under
a
correct
reading
of
the
statute.
we
do
not
accept
the
contention,
that
the
state
has
a
compelling
interest
in
complying
with
whatever
preclearance
mandates
the
justice
department
issues.
where
a
state
relies
on
a
department's
determination
that
race-based
districting
is
necessary
to
comply
with
the
voting
rights
act,
the
judiciary
retains
an
independent
obligation
in
adjudicating
consequent
equal
protection
challenges
to
ensure
that
the
state's
actions
are
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
a
compelling
interest.
the
voting
rights
act
and
it's
grant
of
authority
to
the
federal
courts
to
uncover
official
efforts
to
abridge
minorities'
right
to
vote,
has
been
of
vital
importance
in
eradicating
invidious
discrimination
from
the
electoral
process
and
enhancing
the
legitimacy
of
our
political
institutions.
as
a
nation
we
share
both
the
obligation
and
the
aspiration
of
working
toward
this
end.
the
end
is
neither
assured
nor
well
served,
however,
by
carving
electorates
into
racial
blocs.
"if
our
society
is
to
continue
to
progress
as
a
multiracial
democracy,
it
must
recognize
that
the
automatic
invocation
of
race
stereotypes
retards
that
progress
and
causes
continued
hurt
and
injury."
it
takes
a
shortsighted
and
unauthorized
view
of
the
voting
rights
act
to
invoke
that
statute
which
had
played
a
decisive
role
in
redressing
some
of
the
worst
forms
of
discrimination,
to
demand
the
very
racial
stereotyping
the
fourteenth
amendment
forbids.
