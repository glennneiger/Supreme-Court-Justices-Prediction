v.
johnson.
spectators
are
admonished,

outside

courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
walbert,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
that
overruled
later?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
walbert,
following
brown
v.
board
of
education
there
were
a
number
of
challenges
to
school
districting
in
the
north
where
there
had
never
been
segregation
by
law,
and
those
challenges
were
based
on
the
idea
that
the
school
district,
the
school
boards
drew
racially
sensitive
district
lines
tending
to
keep
blacks
in
one
district,
and
those
kind
of
inquiries
were
exactly
the
same
sort
of
inquiry
here,
what
was
the
predominant
purpose
of
the
school
board,
and
apparently
those
matters
were
dealt
with
without
any
great
difficulty.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
if
you
asked
a
school
board
what
was
the
most
complex
matter
came
before
it
that
the
school
board
would
probably
say
redistricting--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--drawing
attendance
zones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
although
the
motive
inquiry
was
handled
apparently
without
any
undue
difficulty
in
the
claims
of
de
facto
segregation,
the
similar
motive
inquiry
can't
be
handled
in
a
case
like
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
they
manage
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
the
court...
this
is
a
little
bit...
i
don't
think
the
court
held
that.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
walbert.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are
you
stipu...
are
you
assuming
that
irish
descent,
polish
descent
is
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
the
same
way
that
race
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
just
repudiates,

categorization
by
race
is
subjected
to
a
much
more
demanding
standard
of
inquiry
than
something
else.
chief

william
h.

yes.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,

days.
mr.

we'll

from
