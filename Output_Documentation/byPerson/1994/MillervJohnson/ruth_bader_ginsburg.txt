general
days,
maybe
i
can
help
get
you
to
focus
on
the
question
i
think
justice
souter
was
trying
to
put.
there
is
in
this
record
two
plans,
successive
plans--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the
state
legislature
put
forward
with
two,
not
three
districts.
both
were
turned
down
by
the
department
of
justice.
justice
ruth
bader

what
relevance,
if
any,
does
that
have
that
georgia
tried
for
two
and
only
when
it
was
turned
down
by
the
department
of
justice
did
it
come
up
with
three?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
plan
that
georgia
legislature
adopted,
i
endeavor
to
explain
in
my
dissenting
opinion,
merited
this
court's
approbation,
not
its
condemnation.
legislative
districting
is
highly
political
business.
this
court
has
largely
respected
the
competence
of
state
legislatures
to
attend
to
the
task.
when
race
is
the
issue,
however,
courts
have
intervened
in
recent
decades
to
prevent
dilution
of
minority
voter
strength.
generations
of
rank
discrimination
against
african-americans,
as
citizens
and
as
voters,
account
for
that
surveillance.
two
terms
ago,
in
shaw
v.
reno,
this
court
took
up
a
claim
"analytically
distinct"
from
a
vote
dilution
claim.
shaw
authorized
judicial
intervention
in
extremely
irregular
apportionments
in
which
the
legislature,
plaintiff’s
alleged,
cast
aside
traditional
districting
practices
to
consider
race
alone
in
the
shaw
case
to
create
a
district
in
north
carolina,
in
which
african-americans
would
compose
a
majority
of
the
voters.
today
the
court
moves
beyond
shaw
to
announce
the
federal
courts
undertake
searching
review
of
any
district
with
contours
"predominantly
motivated
by
race.”
strict
scrutiny
will
be
triggered
not
only
when
traditional
districting
practices
are
abandoned,
but
also
when
those
practices
are
subordinated
to
that
is
given
less
weight
than
race.
applying
this
new
race
as
the
predominant
factor
standard,
the
court
invalidates
georgia's
districting
plan
because
georgia's
eleventh
district,
the
focus
of
today's
dispute,
was
designed
to
have
a
majority
nonwhite
electorate.
in
contrast
to
the
snake-like
north
carolina
district
inspected
in
shaw,
however
georgia’s
eleventh
district
is
not
bizarre,
it
is
not
extremely
irregular
or
irrational
on
its
face.
instead
the
eleventh
district
like
georgia’s
majority
white
districts
bears
the
imprint
of
familiar
districting
practices.
the
district
covers
a
core
area
in
central
and
eastern
georgia,
and
its
total
land
area
some
6800
square
miles
is
about
average
for
the
state.
the
border
of
the
eleventh
district
runs
close
to
1200
miles
in
line
with
georgia's
second
district,
which
has
over
1200
miles
to
its
border
and
the
state's
eighth
district,
with
the
border
also
running
close
to
1200
miles.
nor
does
the
eleventh
district
disrespect
the
boundaries
of
political
subdivisions.
of
the
22
counties
in
the
district,
14
are
intact
and
8
are
divided
and
that
puts
the
eleventh
district
at
about
the
state
average
in
divided
counties
and
notably
the
eleventh
district’s
boundaries
largely
follow
precinct
lines.
the
court's
disposition
renders
redistricting
perilous
work
for
state
legislatures.
statutory
mandates
and
political
realities
may
require
states
to
consider
race
when
drawing
district
lines.
but
today's
decision
is
a
counterforce;
it
opens
the
way
for
federal
litigation
if
traditional
districting
practices
arguably
were
accorded
less
weight
than
race.
attention
to
traditional
districting
practices
and
avoidance
of
bizarre
configurations
seemed
under
shaw
to
provide
a
safe
harbor.
in
view
of
today's
decision,
which
cuts
lose
from
the
bizarreness
criterion,
that
is
no
longer
the
case.
only
after
litigation
under
either
the
voting
rights
act,
the
court's
new
miller
predominantly
motivated
by
race
standard
or
both
will
states
now
be
assured
that
plans
conscious
of
race
are
safe.
federal
judges
in
large
numbers
may
be
drawn
into
the
fray.
this
enlargement
of
the
judicial
role
and
its
deployment
to
stem
the
creation
of
my
majority-minority
district
is
unwarranted
and
unsettling.
the
division
of
opinion
here
however,
suggests
that
in
this
difficult
area,
the
court
has
not
yet
spoken
a
final
word.
