justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
think
the
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
was
provided
by
the
statement
of
judicial
notice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
know
how
to
manufacture
legislative
history,
is
what
you're
saying.
[laughter]
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
i
understand.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
view
of
a
portion
of
the
district
court's
holding--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
grows
out
of
justice
scalia's
suggestion
that
perhaps
community
of
interest
among
persons
in
a
group
might
justify
an
odd-shaped
district,
and
the
district
court,
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out,
said
that
the
problem
with
doing
that
is
that
such
a
community
of
interest
is
barred
from
constitutional
recognition
if
it's
defined
by
racial
group.
do
you
think
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
assume
we
don't
have
a
bizarre
shape,
if
you
just
have
evidence
of
predominant
motive,
and
then
the
response
is,
yes,
we
had
the
predominant
motive,
but
we
were
trying
to
justify...
we
tried
to
justify
it
on
the
grounds
of
a
community
of
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
my
question
is,
is
that
barred
from
constitutional
recognition,
in
your
view?
you
could
probably
tell
me
yes
or
no,
i
suppose.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
should
be
barred
from
constitutional
recognition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
assume
you...
if
it's
barred
from
constitutional
recognition,
it
could
be
a
perfect
community.
they
could
all
go
to
the
same
church,
all
belong
to
the
same
athletic
clubs,
and
all
do
everything
in
common,
but
it
would
still
be
impermissible
under
the
court...
as
i
read
the
court
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
think
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
as
in
justice
thomas'
hypo
for
example,
they're
all
members
of
the...
90
percent
members
of
the
democratic
party,
they're...
90
percent
go
to
the
same
church,
90
percent
share
certain
athletic
interests,
or
other
community
interests,
would
that
be
permissible
justification?
that's
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
envision
rather
long,
factual
trials
on
these
cases,
on
both
sides,
both
on
the
motive
issue
and
on
the
justification
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
you
say,
you
didn't
have
shaw
v.
reno.
after
shaw
v.
reno,
do
you
think
you
can
do
it
in
a
week?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
you
had
a
legislative
finding
that
all
the
people
in
the
district
shared
a
community
of
interest,
a
legislative
finding
tracking
the
language
that
they
tried
to
put
in,
the
evidence
they
tried
to
put
in
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
the
end
of
the
case,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
precinct
captains
used
to
do
this?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
precinct
captains
ever
did
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
it
in
chicago.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
your
footnote
described
the
complaint
in
another
case,
that
they
were
describing,
the
complaint
in
jones...
is
this
jones
v.
miller?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they're
describing
the
complaint
in
that
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
if
the
city,
say,
was
composed
of
one-third
polish
americans,
one-third
swedish
americans,
and
one-third
irish
americans,
they
could
set
out
to
divide
up
the
city
council
in
thirds
for
representation
of
each.
that
would
be
constitutionally
permissible,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
only
reason,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
hope
they
wouldn't
do
it,
but
would
it
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--other
than
a
presumption
that
may
or
may
not
be
valid--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
swedish
americans
tend
to
share
certain
interests,
they
have
swedish
clubs
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you'd
say
strict
scrutiny
would
be
required
even
though
there
was
no
racial
basis
in
that
one?
