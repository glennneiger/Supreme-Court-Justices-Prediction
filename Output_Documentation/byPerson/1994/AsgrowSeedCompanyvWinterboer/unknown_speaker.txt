unknown
speaker
will
you
repeat
the
pages
number
again?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
preliminary
question?
2543,
the
right
to
save
seed
crop
exemption
section,
there's
a
"provided"
part
of
the
sentence
that
says,
"provided",
and
then
there's
a
sentence
following
that.
do
i
understand
that
congress
has
now
amended
this
statute
and
taken
that
proviso
out?
unknown
speaker
and
that
takes
effect
not
retroactively,
but
sometime
in
the
future?
unknown
speaker
so
this
case
is
not
moot.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
were
to
come
before
us
under
the
new
statute,
it
would
govern,
i
suppose.
i
mean,
there
wouldn't
be
this
exception,
this
proviso.
unknown
speaker
it
completely
eliminates
the
socalled
brown
bag
exemption.
unknown
speaker
uhhuh.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
does
it
continue
to
read,
"or
for
sale
as
provided
in
this
section.
"
or
did
they
take
out
that,
too?
unknown
speaker
who
do
you
suppose--
--i'm
not
surprised.
--drafted
this
statute?
do
we
know
to
whom
we
owe
this
debt
of
gratitude
for
perfect
language?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
into
that,
just
one
more
question
about
the
amendment.
is
it
not
true
that
the
two
remaining
sentences
after
the
proviso
has
been
deleted
did
allow
some
sales
of
seed,
so
that
there
still
is
some
room
for
the
sale
as
provided--
unknown
speaker
--it
goes
into
cereal,
or
beanbags,
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
but
you
concede
that
he
can
save
the
seeds--
unknown
speaker
--for
some
purposes.
unknown
speaker
well,
for
any
purpose.
can't...
doesn't
the...
don't
you
concede
that
a
farmer
can
set
aside
all
the
seed
he
has
and
decide
later
what
he
wants
to
do
with
it?
he
saves
seed
because
he
isn't
sure
how
many
acres
he
wants
to
plant
next
year
in
soybeans,
and
how
much
he
might
need
would
depend
on
that,
or
he
might
think
the
price
was
going
to
go
up,
and
if
he
saved
the
soybeans
he'd
get
more
later.
i
suppose
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
for
saving
seeds.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
doesn't
come
into
play
until
the
sale
is
made.
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
have
to
look
at
the
purpose.
unknown
speaker
at
the
time
of
sale.
unknown
speaker
and
the
federal
circuit,
in
deciding
this
case,
placed
a
lot
of
emphasis
on
the
word,
marketed,
didn't
it,
in
the
exception
(3),
is
it,
in
2541?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
say
the
term,
"marketing"
necessarily
includes
selling?
unknown
speaker
then
it's...
marketing
should
be
the
broader
term--
unknown
speaker
--not
the
selling.
unknown
speaker
if
we
agree
with
you
on
that,
do
we
have
to
reverse?
i
mean,
is
that
what
it
turns
on?
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
i'm
not
sure
how
you
get
the
amount
from
that,
because
if
there
was
no
violation
of
2541(3),
so
that
the
farmer
did
not
sexually
multiply
the
novel
variety
as
a
step
in
marketing,
including
as
a
step
toward
selling,
then
theoretically
his
whole
crop,
i
suppose,
is
subject
to
sale,
is
it
not?
now,
we
might
very
well
say,
or
a
jury
might
very
well
say,
if
he
sold
the
whole
crop,
well,
we
know
perfectly
well
he
must
have
planted
with
that
intent.
he
must
have
sexually
multiplied
with
that
intent,
and
they
might
find
a
violation.
but
in
theory,
if
he
did
not
plant
with
the
intent
specified
in
2541(3),
in
theory
his
entire
crop
might
be
subject
to
sale
without
violation.
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
sure,
but
he
might
have
planted
a
crop
and
decided
at
the
end
of
the
season
that
he's
decided
to
get
out
of
farming,
so
he
doesn't...
and
if
the
market,
let's
say,
for
seed,
is
higher
than
the
market
for
meal,
he
might
say,
i'm
going
to
get
out
of
the
business
completely,
i'm
just
going
to
sell
all
my
seed
to
my
neighbors.
that
wasn't
my
intent
when
i
started
out,
but
that's
my
intent
now.
they
can
raise
the
stuff.
where
is
that
a
violation?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you've
left
off
the...
if
saved
seed
in
the
production
of
a
crop
for
use
on
his
farm,
you
left
out
the
words,
"or
for
sale
as
provided
in
this
section.
"
unknown
speaker
that's
critical
also,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
question,
then,
is
what
is
provided
in
this
section?
unknown
speaker
but
why
do
you
say
it's
only
in
the
production
of
a
crop,
because
in
the
very
next
phrase,
"or
for
sale
as
provided
in
this
section.
"
it
seems
to
me
either
purpose
describes
a
kind
of
such
saved
seed.
unknown
speaker
but
where
do
you
get
the
definite
amount?
unknown
speaker
because
you're
reading
the
phrase
to
mean,
shall
not
infringe
any
right
to
save
seed,
and
use
such
saved
seed
in
the...
(a)
in
the
production
of
a
crop
for
use
on
his
farm,
or
(b)
for
sale.
that's
your
reading.
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
for
sale
necessarily
relates
back
to
the
saved
seed,
and
if
that
implies
quantity,
then
the
amount
that
can
be
sold
is
subject
to
that
quantity.
that's
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
you
place
a
lot
of
stress
on
the
"except"
clause,
"except
to
the
extent
that
such
action
may
constitute
an
infringement
under
subsection
(3).
"
if
i
understand
your
argument,
it
is
that
provision
which
prevents
a
farmer
from
saving
seed
for
reproductive...
for
crop
production
purposes,
other
than
his
own
crop.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
without
that
"except",
he'd
be
able
to
save
as
much
seed
as
he
wanted
for
crop
production
purposes,
for
future
seeding
purposes.
what
prevents
him
from
saving
an
infinite
quantity
for
future
seeding
purposes
is
that
if
he
set
out
with
the
intention
of
selling
it
to
somebody
else
for
seeding
as
opposed
to
using
it
for
seeding
himself,
he
would
be
violating
the
"except"
clause.
that
is,
he'd
be
violating
subsection
(3),
he'd
be
multiplying
the
novel
variety
as
a
step
in
marketing.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
on
the
facts
of
this
case
there's
no
dispute
that
the
crop
was
grown
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
marketing
all
of
it
to
other...
excuse
me,
not
marketing,
selling
it
to
other
farmers?
there
was
no
pretense
that
this
seed
was
going
to
be
either
used
for
replanting--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
farmer's
own
farm,
or
was
going
to
be
sold
for
nonreproductive
use,
that
there
was
an
admission
that
all
of
it
was
sold
to
other
farmers.
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
sold
to
others
as
seed.
unknown
speaker
and
getting
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
or
at
least
the
section
that
he
was
focusing
on,
i
don't
understand
why
his
cultivation
of
that
crop
was
not
a
violation
of
the
act
under
your
theory,
because
this
was
sexually
multiplying
a
novel
variety
as
a
step
in
marketing,
but
you
told
justice
o'connor
that
you
have
to
wait
till
the
sale
before
there's
a
violation,
and
i
don't
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
why?
why
couldn't
he
decide
to...
you
acknowledge
that
vegetable
farmers
save
5
years'
worth,
typically.
unknown
speaker
why
couldn't
the
soybean
farmer
decide
that
he's...
you
know,
i'm
going
to
save
5
years'
worth.
i'll
not
just
plant
the
crop
next
year,
i'll
plant
it
the
year...
are
you
placing
stress
on
the
word,
and
use
such
saved
seed
in
the
production
of
a
crop
for
use
on
his
farm?
you
mean
only
one
crop,
only
1
year's
worth,
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--only
1
year's
crop,
you're
saying.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that
there
is
no
limitation
on
saving,
the
limitation
is
on
save
plus
sell.
unknown
speaker
he
can
save
as
many
seeds,
either
to
plant
himself
or
to
sell
for
nonreproductive
use.
there's
no
limitation
on
saving
for
those
two
purposes.
unknown
speaker
what...
even
though
they
have
more
acreage
on
that
farm?
unknown
speaker
so
the
most
they
can
save
is
enough
for
800?
unknown
speaker
suppose
they're
thinking
of
buying
the
next
farm.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
go
out
of
business
after
1
year
and
you
have
4
years'
worth
of
seeds
left,
you're
saying,
tough
luck,
you
can't
do
anything
but
eat
it.
unknown
speaker
oh,
but--
--you
couldn't
sell
to--
--you
sell
it
to
the
developer.
he's
going
to
put
up
condos.
you
couldn't
sell
them
to
the
neighboring
farm.
unknown
speaker
four
years
worth
of
seed.
you've
got
to--
unknown
speaker
--what
do
you
do
with
tomato
seeds--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
stanley,
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
the
practical
difference,
at
least
in
the
soybean
business
and
barring
unforeseen
contingencies,
between
your
position
and
your
opponent
is
that
you
say
he
can
only
sell
1/45th
of
the
seed
he
produces,
and
he
says
he
can
sell
up
to
a
half?
unknown
speaker
in
this
particular--
unknown
speaker
--and
then
the
second
question,
if
you
do
have
the
time
to
address
it
before
you
finish
is,
could
you
tell
me
to
what
extent
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
relied,
and
presumably
erroneously,
on
the
sentence
after
the
proviso
that
congress
has
now
deleted?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
if...
suppose
we
thought
the
federal
circuit
got
it
right,
except
insofar
as
it
defined
"marketing".
how
does
that
affect
the
outcome?
unknown
speaker
that
would
mean
the
farmer
could
do
what,
if
we
disagreed
on
the
definition
of
"marketing"?
unknown
speaker
how
would
that
affect
the
outcome
in
this
case
at
the
bottom
line?
unknown
speaker
why...
if
what
justice
o'connor
supposes
is
correct,
we
disagree
with
them
on
marketing,
why
can't
you
win
your
case
under
2541(3),
that
there
was
a
sexual
multiplication
of
novel
varieties,
a
step
in
marketing,
end
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i'm
just
asking
you,
suppose
we
think
that
the
cafc
was
basically
correct
except
insofar
as
erroneously
defining
marketing,
what's
the
bottom
line
outcome
here,
if
that's
our
view?
unknown
speaker
but
more
than
what
you
say.
unknown
speaker
you
really
haven't
answered
my
question,
and
if
what
we
think
is
that
the
only
error
made
below
was
in
the
definition
of
the
term,
"marketing",
what
do
we
do
with
this
case,
and
how
does
it
affect
the
outcome
at
the
bottom
line?
unknown
speaker
even
given
the
circuit's
opinion
and
interpretation
of
the
"except"
clause
in
the
first
few
lines
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
no,
what
i--
unknown
speaker
--very
well,
mr.
stanley.
mr.
seamon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
and
you
disagree
with
that.
you
think--
unknown
speaker
--that
at
a
minimum,
"marketing"
is
the
larger
term,
and
it
includes
selling.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
cafc
except
insofar
as
it
defines
marketing,
or
do
you
think
it
made
other
errors?
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
you,
mr.
seamon,
to
help
me
with
one
point?
if
one...
and
i
think
this
is
way
the
federal
circuit...
construes
the
word
"marketing"
to
embrace
all
kinds
of
commercial
distribution
other
than
brown
bag
sales
to
other
farmers
if
that
were
a
correct
reading
of
the
word
"marketing",
then
the
court
was
right,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
they
made
other
errors,
but
the
result
would
be
correct,
if
one
read
it
that
way,
and
i
know
you
disagree
with
that
reading,
and
it
is
kind
of
counterintuitive,
but
if
you
do
construe
"marketing"
as
to
cover
the
universe
other
than
brown
bag
sales,
then
i
think
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
now?
unknown
speaker
on
his
farm.
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
saves
enough
seed
for
5
years'
worth
of
crops?
unknown
speaker
one
season.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
this
is
an
academic
question,
because
the
seeds
don't
last
for
more
than
a
year?
unknown
speaker
unlike
vegetables,
which
you
can
keep
for
5
years,
in
some
cases?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
had
violated
it
even
before
the
sale,
then,
hadn't
they?
unknown
speaker
very
cleverly
drafted,
it
really
is,
isn't
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
second
point?
nobody's
even
talked
about
that.
is
that
not
in
the
case?
there
is
a
point
on
which
you
disagree
with
petitioners,
and
that
is--
unknown
speaker
--labeling.
labeling,
right.
right,
whether
you
have
to
give
notice
to
the
person
to
whom
you
sell.
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
the
case?
do
we
have
to
decide
that?
unknown
speaker
you
say
it
is
not?
unknown
speaker
because
that's
too
remote
from
selling,
whereas
notice
is
not
too
remote.
why
make
us
draw
lines
like
that?
why
not
just
say,
selling
is
selling,
and
you're
exempted
from
that,
but
all
the
other
requirements
continue
to
apply?
i
don't
know
why
exportation
is
more
remote
than
notice
is.
unknown
speaker
why?
i
mean,
you've
got
to
sell
to
somewhere.
if
you
sell
abroad,
it's
exportation.
unknown
speaker
this
applies
to
all
state
laws,
not
just
state
laws
regarding
notice,
so
your
argument
really,
if
carried
to
its
conclusion,
would
say
all
state
laws
are
covered,
but
none
of
the
things
listed
in
2541
are
covered.
you
may
answer
the
question.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
question.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
seamon.
mr.
bode,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
that.
they
had
no
purpose
in
mind--
unknown
speaker
--just
went
out--
unknown
speaker
--but
can
that
be
true?
i
mean,
didn't
they
produce
enough
seed
so
they
couldn't
have
used
it
up
in
20
or
30
years,
and
you
can't
save
seed
that
long.
unknown
speaker
are
you
then
disagreeing--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
then
disagreeing...
not
knowing
much
about
farming,
we
were
told
by
one
person
that
the
soybean
seed
spoils
in
a
year
or
so.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
it
saves...
you
can
save
it
and
still
retain
its
quality
for
how
long?
unknown
speaker
for
how
long?
unknown
speaker
four
to
five
years?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
not
true
that
the
amount
of
seeds
they
produced
was
far
in
excess
of
enough
for
a
crop
for
four
or
five...
far
in
excess
of
four
or
five
crops?
unknown
speaker
so
then
is
it
not
patent
that
they
had
a
purpose
in
mind
that
they
would
sell
some
of
it
to
their
neighbors?
unknown
speaker
i
just
don't
understand
that
answer,
because
you
say
they
did
produce
enough
seed
they
couldn't
use
it
all
for
their
own
production,
even
in
4
or
5
years,
and
they
didn't
do
it
inadvertently,
did
they?
i
mean,
they
didn't
grow
the
amount
inadvertently?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be,
and
it
may
not
be
controlling,
but
it
just
is
clear,
it
seems
to
me,
that
they
must
have
contemplated
selling
some
of
their
seed
at
the
time
they
planted
this
crop.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
they
said
you
could
save
any
amount
but
couldn't
sell
any
amount
for
sexual
multiplication
purposes.
unknown
speaker
you
can--
unknown
speaker
--you
can
sell
seed
to
make
oil
out
of,
can't
you,
to
be
consumed?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
reproductive.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
now
has
been
written
out
of
the
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
your
view,
then,
if
a
farmer
made
51
percent
of
his
income
from
growing
melons,
and
he
devoted
the
remainder
of
his
farm
to
growing
soybeans,
he
could
be
in
the
brown
bag
business
with
100
percent
of
his
soybean
crop
because
he
would
still
be
predominantly
in
the
business
of...
or
the
predominant
source
of
his
income
would
be
that
of
farming
rather
than
selling.
unknown
speaker
i'm
puzzled.
i
thought
that
you
lost
at
least
in
part
in
the
federal
circuit
because
your
view
of
this
was,
as
long
as
it's
a
farmer
selling
to
another
farmer,
you're
home
free,
as
long
as
most
of
what
both
buyer
and
seller
do,
grow
crops
to
sell
the
product,
but
the
federal
circuit
cut
you
back
and
said...
what
percent
did
they
allow?
unknown
speaker
so
you
were
arguing
100
percent.
unknown
speaker
you
weren't?
unknown
speaker
what
were
you
arguing?
unknown
speaker
i
thought...
correct
me
on
this.
i
thought
the
federal
circuit
had
made
the
primary
farming
occupation
test
specific
to
each
crop.
unknown
speaker
is
that
correct?
all
right.
unknown
speaker
and
was
that
your
position
from
the
beginning,
so
that
you
conceded
even
in
the
district
court
that
you
were
in
violation
of
the
statute
in
part?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bode--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
understand
what
you
said
just
before
we
got
into
this
discussion
that
under
petitioner's
interpretation
the
limitation
to
primary
farming
occupation
is
irrelevant.
why
is
that
so?
unknown
speaker
only
if...
only
if
you
apply
that
provision
cropbycrop,
rather
than
across
the
board.
well--
unknown
speaker
--go
ahead,
answer
justice
scalia's
question.
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
term
primary
farming
occupation
found
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
he--
--how
do
we
know
who
that
is?
is
it
the
farmer
when
you
look
at
the
entire
farm
and
see
the
whole
production
of
the
farm
and
ask
how
much
is
sold--
unknown
speaker
--for
reproductive
purposes?
unknown
speaker
even
under
their
reading,
that
definition
would
at
least
limit
the
class
of
eligible
purchasers,
though.
you
say
it
would
be
totally
useless,
but
not
as
to
defining--
unknown
speaker
--you've
lost
me.
what
are
the
two
sentences?
you
consider
the
proviso
a
separate
sentence?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
a
bona
fide
sale
for
other
than
reproductive
purposes,
that's
the
sentence
you're--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
bode--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
bode,
judge
newman
called
this
an
ungainly
statute,
and
i
suppose
that's
a
proposition
that
everyone
would
agree
with,
and
if
we
are
of
the
mind
that
there's
more
than
one
plausible
reading
to
this
statute,
your
way
is
plausible,
asgrow's
way
is
plausible,
the
district
court's
way,
how
do
we
decide
which
is
the
one
that
congress
meant?
unknown
speaker
then
let's
just
stay
with
judge
rader
and
judge
newman.
unknown
speaker
if
we
think
both
of
their
interpretations
are
reasonable
interpretations,
interpretations
that
the
words
of
this
ungainly
statute
will
bear,
then
how
do
we
decide?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
answer
my
question
if
we
think
they're
both
reasonable.
the
federal
circuit--
unknown
speaker
--did
divide
6
to
5
whether
to
hear
this
en
banc,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
if
we...
to
accept
your
position,
must
we
say,
judge
newman's
interpretation
is
wrong,
that
there
is
a
right
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
it's
your
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
should
think
that
judge
newman's
interpretation
is
a
plausible
interpretation,
then
you
say
one
thing
we
might
take
into
account
is
what
the
farming
community
thought
the
statute
meant.
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
we
do
if
we
think
that
the
federal
circuit's
definition
of
marketing
was
wrong,
that
it
does
include
selling?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
your
point.
don't
you
think
"without
regard
to",
it
means
"despite"?
don't
you
think
"without
regard
to"
means
"despite"?
unknown
speaker
no?
unknown
speaker
that's
despite.
despite...
right,
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
asked
you,
what
if
we
disagree
with
that,
and
i
have
not
heard
an
answer.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but--
unknown
speaker
--that's
assuming
that
the
definition
of
2541(3),
right,
which
i'm
not
sure
it
does.
unknown
speaker
--why
isn't
it
redundant
under
yours
as
well?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
this
is
just
an
unnecessary
assertion
in
the
statute
that
so
long
as
you
don't
expect
it
to
be
used
for
reproductive
purposes,
you're
not
going
to
be
held
liable,
but
that
would
apply
to
a
sale
of
more
than
50
percent
by,
you
know,
your
interpretation
as
well,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
under
anybody's
interpretation.
but
really...
really,
you
were
saying
that
the
first
limitation
is
controlled
by
"such
saved
seed",
and
in
this
second
sentence
that
justice
scalia
is
now
focusing
on,
they
do
not
use
the
phrase,
"such
saved
seed".
unknown
speaker
so
the
equivalency
you
seek
between
the
two
sentences
is
absent.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
encompasses,
but
is
not
limited
to
it,
that's
the
point,
and
that
was
the
point
you
were
trying
to
make,
and
i
think
the
argument
fails
because
of
the
absence
of
that
phrase
in
the
second
sentence.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
true
with
soybeans.
that's
not
true--
unknown
speaker
--he
can
sell
them
for
soybean--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you
one--
--and
that's
what
most
people
do,
for
heaven's
sakes,
they
grow
soybeans
to
sell
as
crop.
i
mean,
the
brown
bag
thing
is
really
kind
of
a
smaller
exception,
isn't
it,
if
you
look
overall?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
in
the
price?
they're
selling
it
as
brown
bag
seed.
what
would
they
get
for
it,
as
opposed
to
they're
selling
it
as
soybean
for
nonreproductive
use?
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
were
selling
it...
if
the
winterboers
were
selling
it
to
sell
to
animals
or
for
human
consumption,
what
would
be
the
price
they
would--
unknown
speaker
--so
they
get
much
more
selling
it
as
seed.
unknown
speaker
that's
obtained
by
the
authority
language?
unknown
speaker
is
the
phrase
you're
focusing
on
"obtained
by
authority"?
unknown
speaker
oh,
the
last
sentence.
unknown
speaker
"a
purchaser
who
diverts
seed
from
such
channels--
"
unknown
speaker
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
so.
i'll
study
that.
but
the
third
sentence
could
also
apply
to
the
first
sentence,
could
it
not?
