mr.
richard
h.
seamon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
a
question
that
arose
previously,
which
is
whether,
if
this
court
disagrees
with
the
federal
circuit's
interpretation
of
the
term
"marketing",
what
the
proper
disposition
of
the
case
should
be.
in
that
event,
the
case
should
be
reversed,
because
in
that
situation,
it's
quite
clear,
if
the
court
rejects
the
very
restrictive
definition
of...
interpretation
of
"marketing"
that
the
federal
circuit
adopted,
respondents'
sales
of
soybeans
constituted
marketing
under
any
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
term.
the
federal
circuit's
restrictive
definition
that
would
say
that
"marketing"
only
involves
the
use
of
middle
men
and
extensive
advertising
isn't
compatible--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--we
certainly
do.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
the
way
in
which
"marketing"
differs
from
"selling"
is
that
marketing
includes
certain
activities
that
lead
up
to
the
sale,
preparing
the
goods
for
sale
in
the
market.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
our
disagreement
is
not
limited
to
that
point,
but
we...
but
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
we
think
that
the
federal
circuit
was
wrong
on
that
point,
and
in
this
case,
it's
particularly
clear
that
what
respondents
did
violated
subsection
(3)
of
section
2541.
they
were
able
to
sell
over
10,000
bushels
of
soybeans
in
a
single
crop
season.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
right,
because
the
federal
circuit
did
make
other
errors.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
believe
that's
correct,
but
i'd
want
to
do
more--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--and
i'll
try
to
do
that
in
the
course
of
addressing
the
other
errors
that
the
federal
circuit
made.
one
of
the
other
errors
that
we
believe
that
the
federal
circuit
made
is
in
its
reading
of
the
language
that
comes
immediately
before
the
word
40a
and
41a
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
we
believe
that
the
phrase,
"for
sale
as
provided
in
this
section.
"
modifies
the
word
"crop",
so
that
what
it
allows
is
a
use
of
the
crop
for
sale
as--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--i
am
reading
the
language
of
section
2543
on
page
41a,
that
immediately
precedes
the
italicized
word,
"proviso"...
"provided".
as
we
read
the
term,
"for
sale
as
provided
in
this
section.
"
it
modifies
the
noun,
"crop".
it
specifies
one
of
the
uses
to
which
the
crop
can
be
put.
for
that
reason,
under
the
language
preceding
the
proviso,
there
is
only
one
use
of
saved
seed,
and
that
is
its
use
in
the
production
of
a
crop.
the
crop
may
then
be
used
in
two
different
ways.
it
may
be
used
on
the
farm,
or
it
may
be
sold
as
provided
in
the
balance
of
the
section,
and
we
understand,
and
for
that
reason
we
believe
that
"such
saved
seed"
refers
only
to
such
seed
as
is
saved
for
the
purpose
of
producing
a
crop.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
on
the
farm.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
would
rely
in
that
case
on
the
term,
"a
crop"
to
suggest
that--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--what
can
be
sold
is
one
season's
worth
of
crop.
now,
we
recognize--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
it
depends
on
the
variety
that
you're
speaking
about.
it
may
well
be
that
soybeans
have
a
limited
useful
life,
but
other
crops--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
my
understanding.
that's
correct.
but
in
any
event,
it
is
correct
that
a
farmer
can
save
any
amount
of
seed
that
he
or
she
wants.
the
rights
of
the
owner
are
only
implicated
when
the
saved
seed
is
used
in
some
way,
and
there
are
a
couple
of
different
kinds
of
uses
that
may
violate
the
owner's
rights.
one
use
is
in
the
production
of
a
crop
as
a
step
in
marketing
the
crop
for
sale
as
seed.
in
this
case,
respondents
clearly
marketed,
used
their
seed
to
produce
seed
for
the
purpose
of
selling
the
resulting
seed
as
seed.
they
never
had
any
intention
of
doing
anything
else
with
it,
and
in
fact
all
of
the...
all
of
their
production
was
sold
for
use
as
seed.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
the
production
itself
violated
subsection
(3),
and
i
would
go
on
to
say
that
even
though
the
proviso
specifies
that
it
operates
without
regard
to
subsection
(3),
all
the
proviso
does
is
to
authorize
the
sale.
it
doesn't
speak
to
the
question
of
whether
the
precedent
production
of
the
crop
was
a
violation
of
the
owner's
rights.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
won't...
i
will
concede
the
point.
[laughter]
the
reason
that
we
believe
the
amount
of
seed
that
may
be
sold
under
the
proviso
is
limited
is
essentially
because
it
can
be
put
only
to
one
use
in
the
production
of
a
crop,
and
is
that
amount
the
sale
of
which
is
permitted
under
the
proviso.
we
think
that
the
primary
intent
of
the
proviso
was
to
allow
a
farmer
who
has
held
back
enough
seed
from
one
year's
crop
to
plant
the
next
year's
crop
to
sell
the
seed
if
the
farmer's
planting
plans
change.
the
federal
circuit's
interpretation
of
the
proviso
allows
farmers
to
go
beyond
that
narrow
but
still
very
practical
purpose
and
compete
directly
with
the
owners
of
the
novel
variety,
and
that
clearly
could
not
have
been
congress'
intent.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
is
in
the
case.
we
suggested
in
our
amicus
submission
that
the
issue
has
not
been
completely
briefed
below.
although
it's
properly
before
the
court.
if
the
court
rules
for
the
petitioner
on
the
question
of
how
much
saved
seed
can
be
sold
under
the
proviso,
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
the
second
issue,
because
the
second
issue
only
arises
assuming
that
a
sale
is
authorized
under
the
proviso.
if
the
court
holds
these
sales
were
not
authorized,
it
doesn't
come
up.
if...
when
a
sale
is
authorized
under
the
proviso,
the
second
question
is
whether
notice
has
to
be
provided
to
the
purchaser
of
the
brown
bag
seed
that
the
seed
is
a
protected
variety
under
the
statute.
we
find
that
issue
to
be
a
difficult
one,
although
on
balance
we
do
agree
with
respondents
that
notice
isn't
required.
i
would
just--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that
notice
is
not
required,
that's
correct.
essentially,
we
believe
there
is
a
lot
of
force
to
petitioner's
argument
that
there
are
some
types
of
infringing
conduct
that
are
so
unrelated
to
the
act
of
selling
a
crop
that
authority
for
the
sale
doesn't
encompass
authority
to
do
the
further
act.
as
an
example,
under
subsection
(2)
of
section
2541,
it
violates
an
owner's
rights
to
import
or
export
seed,
so
we
would
say
that
it
would
violate
subsection
(2)
for
a
farmer
to
export
seed
for
sale
to
a
farmer
in
another
country,
even
though
the
sale
was
otherwise...
met
the
requirements
of
the
proviso.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
well,
the...
the
exportation
is,
indeed,
very
remote
from
the
act
of
selling,
but
what
subsection
(6)
and
the
notice
requirement--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--there
is
a
lot
of
force
to
petitioner's
argument
that
sale
is
one
thing
and
providing
notice
is
another.
the
reason
that
we
ultimately,
on
balance,
side
with
respondents
on
that
point
is
just
that
subsection
(6)
doesn't
just
talk
about
giving
notice,
it
talks
about
dispensing
a
novel
variety.
it
contemplates
that
when
the
novel
variety
is
dispensed
in
some
form,
including
by
sale,
the
selling
farmer
should
provide
notice
to
the
purchasing
farmer
that
the
seed
is
a
protected
type.
but
it's
important
in
this
connection
to
note
that
in
the
proviso
itself,
congress
required
selling
farmers
to
comply
with
state
laws
governing
the
sale
of
crops,
and
many
of
those
state
laws
go
to
labeling
and
providing
certain
information
to
the
farmer
in
connection
with
the
sale.
we
think
that
because
congress
actually
gave
attention
in
the
proviso
itself
to
the
information
that
purchasing
farmers
should
have
regarding
the
variety,
if
it
had
intended
purchasing
farmers
to
have
the
further
information
that
this
seed
is
a
protected
variety,
it
would
have
spoken
to
that
in
the
proviso
itself.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
is
true
that
it
covers
all
state
laws--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--most
of
the
state
laws
governing
the
sale
of
seed
have
to
do
with
the
labeling
in
which...
on
which
the
seed
is
sold.
