mr.
richard
l.
stanley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
is
here
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
the
dominant
issue
in
this
case
is
how
much
of
a
farmer's
crop
in
a
protected
novel
plant
variety
can
be
sold
as
seed
under
the
terms
of
section
2543
of
title
vii
in
the
plant
variety
protection
act.
that
act
provides
exclusive
rights
to
breeders
of
sexually
reproduced
plants.
section
2543
provides
specific
and
limited
exemptions
from
the
acts
of
infringement
that
are
set
forth
in
section
2541
of
the
same
title.
the
text
of
sections
2541
and
2543
can
be
found
at
adjoining
pages
40a
and
41a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix
in
asgrow's
petition
for
certiorari.
i
will
use
these
pages
as
a
reference
as
needed
during
my
argument.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
yes.
it's
40a
and
41a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
they're
also
at
pages
1a
and
2a
of
the
merits
brief,
but
they're
not
on
facing
pages.
in
construing
section
2543,
the
federal
circuit
held
that
qualified
farmers
could
sell
up
to
50
percent
of
their
crop
to
others
for
use
in
reproductive
purposes.
in
other
words,
to
use
it
as
seed.
because
the
language
of
section
2543
does
not
support
that
interpretation,
that
decision
must
be
reversed.
for
proper...
in...
what
the
federal--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--all
right,
on
october
6
congress
amended
the
first
sentence
of
2543
and
removed
everything
after
the
word...
outside
the
word
provided
through
the
end
of
the
sentence,
such
that
the
first
sentence
now
ends
after
as
provided
in
this
section.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
right.
it's
a
prospective
amendment.
it
applies
to
those
certificates
that
are
applied
for
on
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
which
is
180
days
after
the
day
it
was
passed.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
no.
this
case
is
not
moot.
the
both--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--yes.
under
the
new
statute
there
is
no
right
to
sell
saved
seed
at
all
by
somebody
who
produces
it.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
it
eliminates
the
right
to
sell
such
safe
seed
under
the
statute.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
it
probably--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--no,
they
didn't.
they
put
the
period
right
at
the
end
of
"section".
[laughter]
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
i
think
maybe
he
intentionally
remained
nameless.
but
basically
the
job
i
have
today
is
to--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--right.
the
second
sentence
allows
the
sale
of
the
protected
variety
to
be
used
for
nonreproductive
purposes.
there's
a
distinction,
basically,
between...
which
isn't
always
consistent,
the
statute
between
basically
using
a
variety
as
a
crop
and
as
a
seed.
a
seed
is
what
is
planted,
used
to
reproduce
the
variety.
when
the
soybean,
the
variety
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
sold
for
crop,
it's
sold
to
a
mealmaker
or
somebody
to
be
used
for
consumption
purposes--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--right.
then...
the
classic
example
we've
been
using
is
tofu,
but
that's
use
of
it
as
a
crop.
the
saving
seed
aspect
is
when
you
use
the
soybean
for
purposes
of
replanting
it
on
the
farm.
in
the
case
of
soybeans,
the
actual
soybean
is
the
same,
whether
it's
sent
to
the
mealmaker
or
to
the...
you
know,
to
be
used
for
planting.
other
varieties
under
the
act
which
this
act
obviously
applies
to,
the
distinction
of
saving
seed
is
an
intentional
act.
for
purposes
of
that
in
vegetables,
for
something
like
celery
or
tomatoes,
the
plant
has
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
seed.
at
that
point,
the
crop
aspect,
the
tomato
or
the
celery
stalk,
no
longer
is
marketable
for
consumer
reasons.
in
other
words,
the
saving
of
seed
is
an
intentional
act,
because
you
had
to
let
the
seeds
develop
to
the
point
where
they
could
be
replanted.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
right,
by--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--right.
that
they--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--there's
a
lot
of
reasons
for
saving
soybeans.
the
reason
for
saving
seed,
there's...
by
itself,
the
saving
of
seed
is
not
an
act
of
infringement.
the
act
of
infringement
arises
when
a
farmer
saves
seed
and
sells
seed,
and
sells
seed
above
the
amount
that
congress
set
forth
in
the
statute
that
was
the
quantity
that
he
could
save.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
right.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
right.
it's...
looking
at
the
purpose
at
the
time
of
planting
is
not
sufficient.
you
have
to
look
at
the
farmer's
purpose
at
the
time
of
selling.
when
a
decision
is
made--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--right.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
right.
the
federal
circuit
defined
the
term,
"marketing"
very
narrowly,
and
construed
marketing
as
being
selling,
but
only
selling
that
involved
advertising
and
sales
representative
or
concentrated
marketing
aspects.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
it's
marketing--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--it's
marketing...
marketing
at
a
minimum
includes
selling.
it
includes
selling,
but
is
not
limited
to
selling.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
if
you
agree
with
that,
that
affects
the
amount
of
seed
that
can
be
saved.
the
determinative
question
here
is
how
much
seed
can
be
saved
and
sold
under
this
statute.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
because
the
most
that
a
farmer
is
going
to
use
on
his
own
farm
is
that
that
he
would
need
to
replant
his
farm.
if
he's
saving
seed,
particularly
where
he
saves
seed
in
a
manner
that
requires
an
intentional
act--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--that
is
a
violation
because
he
is
selling
more
than
is
allowed
under
the
statute.
if
i
can
turn
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
key
phrase
in
this
is
the
phrase,
"such
saved
seed".
the
term
7,
before
the
proviso,
and
one
at
line
13,
after
the
proviso,
and
two
points
about
1)
it's
a
particular
and
definable
quantity
of
seed.
it
is
not
any
seed
that
is
saved.
it's
not
any
saved
seed
or
any
seed
that's
produced
and
saved.
the
second
thing
is,
it
means
the
same
thing
both
before
the
proviso
and
after
the
proviso,
such
that
that
term,
"such
saved
seed"
has
the
same
meaning
at
both
places
in
the
statute.
the
definition
of
what
"such
saved
seed"
means
stems
right
from
the
opening
clause
of
the
statute.
reading
right
at
the
beginning,
it
says,
"except
to
the
extent
that
such
action
may
constitute
an
infringement
under
subsections
(3)
and
(4)
of
section
2541.
"
now,
that
opening
clause
does
not
mean
the
farmer
is
free
to
do
whatever
he
wants
except
for
violating
(3)
and
(4).
what
it
means
is
that
the
farmer
can
do
that
such
action
that
is
later
described
in
that
first
sentence,
provided
that
action
does
not
violate
(3)
or
(4).
that
action
that's
described
in
that
sentence
is
the
saving
of
seed
produced
by
him,
and
using
such
saved
seed
in
the
production
of
a
crop.
now,
if
you
read
subsection
(3),
it's
an
act
of
infringement
to
sexually
multiply
the
novel
variety
as
a
step
in
marketing
the
variety
for
growing
purposes,
so
if
you
look
at
how
that's
incorporated
into
the
beginning
of
section
2543,
that
means,
except
to
the
extent
that
such
action
may
constitute
sexually
multiplying
the
novel
variety
as
a
step
in
marketing.
it
shall
not
infringe
any
right
for
a
person
to
save
seed
produced
by
him
and
use
such
saved
seed
in
the
production
of
a
crop
for
use
on
his
farm
or
for
sale
as
provided.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
right.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
right.
the
such
saved
seed
can
be
used
in
the
production
or
for
sale
as
provided.
however,
the
such
saved
seed--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--well,
and
also
what
is
the
amount
of
such
saved
seed.
that
is
a
defined
quantity,
and
the
first
part
before
you
get
to
the
proviso
is
what
defines
the
amount
of
such
saved
seed,
and
what
defines
it
is
the
opening
clause.
you
can
save
seed
produced
on
the
farm
and
use
it
to
produce
a
crop,
but
only
to
the
extent
that
it
was
not
sexually
multiplied
as
a
step
in
marketing.
that--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--right,
but
if
such
saved
seed
is
a
definite
amount,
you
could
either
use
it
in
the
production
of
a
crop,
or
sell
it.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
the
definite
amount
comes
from
the
opening
clause.
such--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--right.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
yes.
the
such
saved...
the
word
"such"
is
what
defines
the
quantity.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
the
quantity
is...
if
i--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--well,
he's
not
going
to--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--well,
basically
a
farmer
can
save
for
his
own
use
no
more
seed
than
he'll
need
to
plant
his
farm,
sexually--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--right.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
right.
all
the
asgrow
variety,
protected
variety
seed
that
was
produced
by
the
winterboers
minus
the
amount
that
was
broken
and
not
usable
as
seed,
was
sold
to
others.
i
think
they
saved
a
small
amount
for
a
test
plot
of
less--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--for
use
as
seed
for
reproductive
purposes.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
no,
no.
at
the
time
where...
one
of
the
questions
pointed
out
that
he
may
wait
until
the
following
season
to
decide
what
he
wants
to
do
with
it.
in
that
situation,
you
might
have
to
wait
till
he
decides
to
market
it.
at
the
point
where
it's
clear
that
he
has
a
contract
to
sell
all
his
production
for
seed,
or
something,
at
that
point
there
is
no
amount
of
seed
that
can
be
saved.
however,
the
quantitative
limitation
in
this
case
comes
out
of
the
fact
that
such
saved
seed
is
that
which
was
sexually
multiplied
but
not
as
a
step
in
marketing.
almost
by
common
sense
the
most
that
can
be
is
the
amount
he
would
need
to
replant
on
his
own
farm.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
right.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
production
of
a
crop,
use
such
saved
seed
in
production
of
a
crop
shows
that
that's
one
way
the
saved
seeds
can
be
used,
and
i
think
that's
the...
that
it
helps
limit
the
amount
that
can
be
sold.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
that
can
be
sold.
you
can
save...
the
vegetable
farmer
can
save
seed,
that
the
act
of
saving
is
not
an
infringement.
the
act
of
infringement
only
comes
where
it's
sold,
and
the
sexual
multiplication
that
led
to
having
that
seed
to
sell
is
a
step
in
marketing
that
seed.
now,
i
need
to
use
a--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--saving
by
itself,
without--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--yes.
saving
by
itself,
without
more,
without
intent
to
market,
or
without
a
contract,
or
without
turning
around
and
selling
more,
if
i
can
use
a
hypothetical,
soybeans
generally
we've
been
using
1
acre,
or
1
bushel
per
acre
for
planting.
the
winterboers
have
an
800-acre
farm.
if
they
plant...
they
planted
their
265
acres
and
got
12,000
bushels
of
soybeans.
now,
they
only
need
800
bushels
to
plant
those
800
acres
on
their
farm,
so
the
most
seed
they
can
save
to
use
on
their
farm
is
800
bushels.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
they
have
800
acres.
that's
the
total
acreage
they
have.
they
planted
only
265
acres
in
our
variety.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
for
800,
because
there's...
they
can't
plant
any
more.
they
only
need
1
bushel
per
acre.
therefore--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--if
they
buy...
if
they
buy
the
next
farm
and
at
the
time
that
they're
saving
the
seed,
at
that
point
the
saving
is
not
a
multiplication,
but
if
that
plan
falls
through
and
they
don't
have
a
farm,
they
can
use
as
much
saved
seed
as
they
need
on
their
farm,
and
their
farm
is
still
800
acres.
i
mean,
you
have
a
situation
where
you
may
end
up
with
a
factual
question
if
they
really
had
that
intent,
but
it's
argued
that
in
the
vegetable
farmer
situation
you
can
save
50
years'
worth.
soybeans
cannot
be
saved
beyond
1
year.
they're
oilbased,
and
it's
not
practical
to
save
them.
vegetables,
you
can
put
them
in
the
refrigerator,
save
them
for
50
years,
but
the
most
you're
allowed
to
sell
in
any
1
year
is
what
you
would
need
to
produce
a
crop
on
your
farm.
the
vegetable
farmers
that
appeared
as
an
amicus
before
the
federal
circuit
were
not...
they
were
saving
for
their
own
use,
but
they
were
not
selling.
without
the
act
of
selling,
the
seed
certificate
owner
has
no
problem.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
well,
no.
there
would
be
a
question
on
whether
or
not
the
person
who
may
be
bought
your
business
would
cede
to
your
rights
in
that
seed,
but
you
can't--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--you
couldn't
save
more
than
would
be
needed
for
that
farm.
that's
the
way--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--right.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
they
may...
i
mean,
you
can
always
get
the
authorization
of
the
owner.
there
may
be
a
situation
where
it
can
be
explained
there,
or
the
owner,
if
it's
of
sufficient
quality,
may
well
buy
it
back
from
them.
there
are
ways
to
handle
that.
but
from
the
standpoint
of
how
much
seed
can
be
sold,
anything
beyond
what
they
need
to
produce
on
their
farm...
it
assumes
the
rational
farmer
is
going
to
save
no
more
seed
than
what
he
would
need
to
replant
his
own
farm
unless
he
was
going
to
market
it.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
right.
that's
what...
for
soybeans,
for--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--the
numbers
involved
in
soybeans.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
i
don't
think
the
federal
circuit
relied
on
the
second
sentence,
other
than
to
come
up
with
the
construction
of
"for
seeding
purposes",
which
i
think
both
parties
are
agreed
modifies,
obtained
by...
from
the
owner.
i
think
what
the
federal
circuit
did,
the
federal
circuit
went
wrong
right
at
the
beginning,
where
they
viewed
the
opening
clause
of
the
statute
as
being,
except
to
the
extent
such
action
constitutes
an
infringement
under
subsections
(3)
and
(4).
the
federal
circuit
used
that
as
an
exemption
saying
that
(3)
and
(4)
still
apply
to
farmers
and
the
rest
don't.
the
key
fact
here
is
that
"such
saved
seed"
is
a
defined
quantity
that
means
the
same
thing
when
it's
sold
under
the
proviso,
and
it
can
only
be
that
seed
that
was
sexually
multiplied,
but
not
as
a
step
in
marketing.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
the
federal
circuit's
definition
of
"marketing"--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--the
federal
circuit's
treatment
of
the
term
"marketing"
in
itself
is
erroneous.
you
have
to
look
at
the
two
references
to
section--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--it
would
affect
the
amount
of
seed
that
could
be
sold,
because
the
broader
the
definition
of
"marketing"
to
include
all
selling,
if
this
court
concludes
that
selling
includes
all
forms
of
selling,
i
think
the
answer
comes
up
to
be,
you
can
sell
no
more
than
what
would
be
needed
to
replenish
your
farm.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
that's
what
we
have
done
here,
but
the
question
in
this
case
is,
they're
claiming
that
they
are
under
the
exemption
in
2543,
and
in
order
to
determine
the
meaning
of
2543,
the
scope
of
it,
that's...
they're
claiming
an
exemption.
but
for
the
exemption
in--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--if
marketing
has
a
broader
definition
than
what's
at
the
federal
circuit,
the
amount
of
seed
that
can
be
sold
by
a
farmer
is
less
than
what
the
federal
circuit
held.
however,
the
federal
circuit--
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--the
reason
i'm
having
difficulty
answering
that
question
is,
the
federal
circuit,
by
misconstruing
the
opening
clause
of
the
statute,
their
definition
of
marketing
is
basically
out
on
its
own,
because
it
doesn't
follow
the
structure
of
the
statute,
of
the
two
references
to
2541(3).
therefore,
the
federal
circuit's
interpretation
in
my
view
is
so
divorced
from
the
language
of
the
statute
that
question
doesn't
solve
the
problem.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that,
i
think
that
at
a
minimum
the
case
should
be
remanded
at
the
federal
circuit
to
determine
that
issue,
and
basically
let
them
resort
out
the
issue
under
a
proper
interpretation
of
"marketing".
i
believe
that
when
"marketing"
is
given
its
proper
interpretation,
that
our
position
that
you
can
sell
no
more
than
needed
to
replant
a
farm
is
appropriate.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
i
think
the
federal
circuit's
interpretation
of
the
"except"
clause
cannot
stand
any
scrutiny
at
all.
mr.
richard
l.
stanley
--and
i
think
that's
what
caused
the
problem
with
their
interpretation.
if
marketing
still
applies
under
the
federal
circuit's
guideline,
that
a
farmer
is
still
subject
to
prohibitions
against
marketing,
i
think
the
winterboers
would
be
liable
in
this
particular
case,
but
i
think
the
structure
of
the
statute
would
not
be
solved
for
all
other
pvpa
varieties.
if
i
can
reserve
the
remaining
moments
i
have
for
rebuttal--
