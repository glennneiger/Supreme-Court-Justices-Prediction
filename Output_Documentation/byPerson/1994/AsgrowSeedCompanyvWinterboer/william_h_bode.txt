mr.
william
h.
bode
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
preliminarily,
i'd
like
to
note
that
the
record
establishes
that
the
winterboers
had
no
purpose
in
mind
for
their
crops
when
they
planted
their
crops.
that
is
in
the
deposition
of
mr.
winterboer.
mr.
william
h.
bode
they
had
no--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--purpose
with
respect
to
whether
they
would
sell
the
seed
later
for
reproductive
or
nonreproductive
purposes.
that
purpose
wasn't
established
until
later,
when
market
conditions
at
the
time
of
harvest
were
revealed.
i'd
also
like
to
correct
a
statement--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--well,
first
of
all,
you
can
save
seed
for
years
and
years,
not
just
1
year,
certainly
for
4
or
5
years.
mr.
william
h.
bode
secondly,
you
can
always--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--that's
incorrect.
mr.
william
h.
bode
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
bode
four
to
five
years.
mr.
william
h.
bode
yes.
the
only
effect
is
the
germination
rates
deteriorate
to
some
extent
over
time.
mr.
william
h.
bode
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
bode
no,
your
honor,
because
they
could
sell
all
of
their
harvest
for
consumption
purposes.
now,
the
other
point...
and
i
want
to
elaborate
on
that--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--justice
stevens,
that
ties
in
with
the
interpretation
now
propounded
of
this
text
by
asgrow.
this
was
an
interpretation
that
was
not
discerned
and
argued
by
asgrow
before
the
federal
district
court,
or
the
federal
circuit
panel,
and
it
wasn't
discerned
by
9
of
the
10
amicus...
amici
parties
below.
mr.
william
h.
bode
they
contemplated
selling
their
seed
either
for
reproductive
or
nonreproductive
purposes.
mr.
william
h.
bode
the
point
is
this,
and
it's
a
point
that
was
broached
by
justice
o'connor,
in
the
monsanto
brief
below,
which
invented
this
interpretation
which
is
now
adopted
by
asgrow
and
presented
before
this
court,
there
are
two
premises
that
are
necessary
as
a
matter
of
textual
analysis.
the
first
is
that
"marketing"
has
to
equal
"selling",
and
the
second
is
that
"crop"
has
to
be
limited
to
the
amount
of
seed
to
plant
an
ensuing
crop.
by
way
of
an
example,
if
a
farmer
plants
1
acre
and
harvests
45
bushels
of
soybeans,
then
under
the
recently
found
interpretation
of
this
text
by
asgrow,
it
can
save
only
1
bushel,
but
what
happens
to
the
other
44
bushels?
mr.
william
h.
bode
their
analysis
requires
that
the
term
1
bushel.
in
fact,
your
honor,
monsanto
in
its
brief
makes
this
statement
"if
saved
seed
does
equal
harvested
seed,
then
the
right
to
save
seed
would
be
unlimited
in
scope,
as
long
as
a
farmer
were
selling
to
another
farmer.
"
that's
admitted
by
monsanto,
whose--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--argument
was
adopted.
mr.
william
h.
bode
absolutely.
mr.
william
h.
bode
absolutely,
and
let's
assume
that
in
our
example
45
bushels
of
soybean
are
harvested.
then
the
issue
is,
how
many
can
be
sold
for
reproductive
purposes,
and
the
statute
tells
us
that.
it
tells
us
that
so
long
as
the
primary
farming
occupation
is
the
sale
of
the
soybean
for
nonreproductive
purposes,
the
farmer
can
sale...
can
sell
the
seed
for
growing
purposes.
note,
if
asgrow's
new
interpretation
is
correct,
that
phrase,
that
phrase
or
that
test,
whether...
what
is
a
farmer's
primary
growing
occupation,
would
be
written
entirely
out
of
the
act,
because
under
our
example,
only
1
bushel--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--it
has
been
now
by
congress,
prospectively
only.
mr.
william
h.
bode
yes.
we
believe
that
the
federal
circuit
correctly
parts...
parses
the
statute,
and
it
correctly
interpreted
the
primary
farming
occupation
be
satisfied
when
a
farmer
sells
the
majority
of
his
or
her
crop
for
nonreproductive
purposes.
mr.
william
h.
bode
50
percent
or
more.
mr.
william
h.
bode
no,
we
were
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
bode
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
bode
first
of
all,
we
had
agreed
for
purposes
of
the
appeal
that
the
primary
farming
occupation
of
the
winterboers,
the
test
was
satisfied.
as
we
note
in
footnote
3,
the
winterboers
sold
more
than
50
percent
of
each
of
the
protected
varieties
for
nonreproductive
purposes.
therefore,
the
winterboers
have
satisfied
the
primary
farmer
occupation
test
as
laid
down
by
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
william
h.
bode
that
is
correct--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--and
i
want
to--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--it
was
never
conceded.
it
wasn't
an
issue
before
the
appellate
court
because
both
parties
stipulated
that
winterboers
satisfied
the
primary
farming
occupation,
and
they
do
under
the
test
now
established
by
the
federal
circuit,
because
the
winterboers
with
respect
to
each
of
the
two
varieties
of
seed
never
sold
for
growing
purposes
more
than
50
percent
of
the
crop,
so
the
sales
of
the
winterboers
are
protected--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--according
to
the
federal
circuit
test.
mr.
william
h.
bode
because
under
petitioner's
interpretation,
only
the
most
trivial
amount
of
seed
could
be
sold
for
reproductive
purposes,
in
our
example,
just
1
bushel.
therefore,
there
would
never
be
any
occasion
to
inquire
whether
the
farmer...
primary
farming
occupation
test
was
satisfied,
because
in
every
instance,
the
farmer
would
have
sold
the
majority
of
his
or
her
crop
for
nonreproductive
purposes.
their
interpretation
writes
out
of
the
act
the
primary
farming
occupation
test.
mr.
william
h.
bode
i
think--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--justice...
yes.
justice
scalia,
regardless
of
whether
the
analysis
is
cropbycrop,
that
provision
is
written
out
of
the
statute
by
the
interpretation
of
asgrow,
because
you
never
have
an
occasion
to
inquire
what
the
primary
farming
occupation
would
be,
because
under
the
interpretation
that
they
now
press
before
this
court,
you'd
only
sell
1/45th,
you
only
could
sell
1/45th
of
your
crop.
mr.
william
h.
bode
your
honor,
it's
found
in
the
proviso
in
the
first
section,
and
it
says,
provided
without
regard
to
section
2541,
subsection
(3),
a
farmer
whose
primary
farming
occupation
is
the
growing
of
crops
for
nonreproductive
purposes
may
sell
to
other
farmers
similarly
situated
for
reproductive
purposes.
mr.
william
h.
bode
we--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--justice
o'connor,
we
accept
the
strict
interpretation,
the
strict
reading
of
the
primary
farming
occupation
test
by
the
federal
circuit.
that
is,
it's
a
test
that's
applied
variety
by
variety,
based
upon
the
majority
of
the
sales
made.
mr.
william
h.
bode
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to...
i'm
not
sure
that
i
have
properly
explained
the
crucial
consequence
of
accepting
that
"saved
seed"
means
the
whole
harvest.
you
see,
under
asgrow's
interpretation,
they
must
conclude
that
"saved
seed"
means
only
the
amount
of
seed
to
plant
the
next
crop.
because
otherwise,
when
a
farmer
later
makes
the
election
to
sell
to
other
farmers,
assuming
he's
qualified
to
do
that,
unless
1
bushel
in
our
example,
unless
it
means
that,
then
the
farmer
would
be
able
to
sell
the
whole
harvest,
except
to
the
extent
that
he
would
be
bound
by
the
primary
farming
occupation
test.
and
that's
admitted
by
monsanto
at
page
10
in
their
brief,
and
that's
the
argument
that
now
asgrow
propounds
before
this
court,
and
it's
interesting
to
note
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
submitted
by
asgrow
before
the
federal
district
court,
they
admit
that
6
on
their
brief.
and
where
do
we
get
that
result
textually?
by
the
phrase,
or
for
sale
as
provided
in
this
section.
there
are
two
sales
provided
in
the
section.
in
the
first
sentence,
there's
the
sale
from
farmer
to
farmer
for
reproductive
purposes,
and
the
second
sentence,
the
sale
for
consumption.
those
are
the
two
sales
provided
by
congress.
mr.
william
h.
bode
no.
that's
in
the
first
sentence.
mr.
william
h.
bode
so
the
first
sentence
provides
for
sales
by
farmers
for
reproductive
purposes.
mr.
william
h.
bode
and
the
second
sentence
provides
for
sales
by--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--for
consumption.
mr.
william
h.
bode
so
we
can
see
that
as
a
matter
of
textual
analysis,
"saved
seed"
must
include
the
whole
harvest.
mr.
william
h.
bode
well,
first
of
all,
i
would
disagree,
justice
ginsburg,
that
asgrow's
interpretation
is
reasonable.
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
think
it's
very,
very
contrived
and
resultsoriented.
mr.
william
h.
bode
i
think
that
the--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--justice
ginsburg,
the
unanimous
federal
circuit
panel
had
a
very
straightforward
and
reasonable
interpretation,
and
i
think
that's
an
interpretation
that
should
commend
itself
to
this
court.
in
that
respect,
i'd
like
to
return
to
this--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--i
think--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--i
would
suggest,
then,
that
the...
that
this
court
should
defer
to
the
federal
circuit
for
other
reasons.
among
those
reasons
is--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--i
think
you
should
defer
to
the
federal
circuit
panel,
your
honor,
because
that
is
the
interpretation
that
was
understood
by
the
farming
industry
for
the
last
two
decades.
that's
the
interpretation
that
was
issued
by
the
director
of
the
plant
variety
protection
office.
mr.
william
h.
bode
yes.
i
think
the
court
should
consider
that
the
balance
between
the
rights
of
farmers
and
breeders
struck
by
congress
appropriately
reflected
the
limited
showing
that
an
applicant
must
make
to
obtain
a
certificate.
an
applicant
need
not
show
that
this
new
variety
promotes
agriculture,
science,
or
the
arts,
or
that
it's
novel,
or
that
it's
not
obvious,
or
that
it
has
utility,
even,
the
customary
showings
that
have
to
be
made
for
a
patent.
rather,
the
most
inconsequential
change
of
a
morphological
aspect
of
a
plant,
such
as
the
color
or
shape
of
its
leaves,
qualifies
the
applicant
for
a
certificate.
when
we
appreciate
that,
that's
not
unreasonable
for
congress
to
have
retained
for
farmers
their
ancient
right
to
sell
seed
to
other
farmers.
mr.
william
h.
bode
i
have
two
responses
to
that,
justice
o'connor.
first,
if
you
look
at
the
test,
the
proviso
at
the...
and
the
first
phrase
of
the
proviso
says,
"without
regard
to
2541
subsection
(3).
"
so
whatever
bundle
of
activities
comprise
marketing,
congress
accepted
farmertofarmer
sales
from
those
infringing
acts.
but
i
suggest
that
the
reading
of
the
federal
circuit
is
very
reasonable.
let
me
explain
why.
mr.
william
h.
bode
no,
i
don't.
i
think
it
means--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--without
regard
to
these
infringing
acts,
sales
can
be
made,
that
you
can
make
sales,
if
you're
qualified,
to
another
farmer
for
growing
purposes
without
encroaching
any
right
established
by
2541,
subsection
(3),
and
that's
marketing.
mr.
william
h.
bode
but
i
think
here's
the...
what
the
federal
circuit
did
is
very
reasonable.
the
federal
circuit
interpreted
that
term,
"marketing",
to
mean
coordinated
and
extended
marketing
activities.
the
separate
use--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--it
has
no
consequence.
you
can
still
uphold
the
federal
circuit,
because
whatever
bundle
of
rights
comprise
"marketing",
farmers
are
excepted
from
them
by
the
first
phrase
of
the
proviso
in
the
section.
that
is,
that
without
regard
to
those
infringing
acts--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--the
farmer
can
make
these
sales.
mr.
william
h.
bode
it
does
not,
and
that's
why
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
circuit
was
reasonable.
coordinating
activities
by
agribusinesses
and
wholesalers
is
prescribed,
but
not
the
limited
marketing
activities
of
farmers
incidental
to
farmertofarmer
sales.
for
example,
a
farmer
could
put
out
a
seedforsale
sign
on
his
property
and
entertain
telephone
inquiries
about
the
nature
of
the
seed
he
has
for
sale.
that
might
be
a
marketing
activity,
but
it
wouldn't
be
the
concerted
and
extended
activities,
the
use
of
middle
men,
that's
prescribed
under
the
federal
circuit's
opinion,
and
under
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
in
delta
pine.
therefore,
that's
a
way
of
rationalizing
every
phrase
in
the
section,
making
every
phrase
operative,
and
it
comports
fully
with
the
federal
circuit's
interpretation,
extended,
coordinated
selling
activities
involving
the
multiplication
of
seed
for
growing
purposes
is
prohibited,
and
a
farmer
cannot
enter
contracts
with
farm
cooperatives
and
cotton
gins
and
wholesalers
to
multiply
seed
for
that
purpose,
but
a
farmer
can
engage
in
these
incidental
activities,
incidental
selling
activities
associated
with
selling
seed
to
another
farmer
directly.
mr.
william
h.
bode
that's
our
point.
what
happens--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--we
concede
that
wording
is
superfluous,
and
it's
an
artifact
of
the--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
bode
but
as
provided
by
the
phrase,
"or
for
sales
provided
herein",
and
in
petitioner's
brief,
they
concede
before
the
federal
district
court
the
saved
seed
encompasses
seed
sold
under
the
second
sentence.
mr.
william
h.
bode
we
disagree,
again,
because
the
specific
phrase,
or
for
sale
as
provided
in
that
section,
but
more
broadly,
because
of
this
problem...
this
problem,
justice
kennedy
what
is
the
farmer
to
do
with
the
other
44
bushels?
unless
the
farmer
is
exempted
from
those
infringing
acts
in
2541,
which
is
provided
in
the
first
sentence,
there's
very
little
he
can
do
with
it,
so
if
the
farmer
is
to
sell--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--seed
under
the
second
sentence,
he
has
to
be
relieved
of
many
or
most
of
the
infringing
acts.
mr.
william
h.
bode
for
soybean
consumption.
mr.
william
h.
bode
it
is.
the
winterboers
operate
on
the
fringe
of
the
market.
they're
selling
to
farmers
who
are
willing
to
buy
seed
that's
perceived
to
be
inferior.
generally,
farmers
aren't
going
to
trust
their
livelihood
to
unproven
seed
without
the
imprimatur
of
a
recognized
seed
company.
mr.
william
h.
bode
the
record
here
discloses
that
the
winterboers
received
approximately
eight
dollars
and
fifty
cents
8.50
for
their
soybeans,
whereas
asgrow
was
charging
15
to
16
dollars
a
bag.
mr.
william
h.
bode
approximately
5
to
6
dollars
a
bag.
mr.
william
h.
bode
they
get
essentially
the
amount
which
represents
the
labor
added
for
the
cleaning
activity
that's
necessary
prior
to
selling
it
for
reproductive
purposes.
justice
kennedy,
if
i
might,
if
you
look
in
that
second
sentence
again,
you'll
see
there's
a
notice
provision.
in
other
words,
it
springs
into
life
a
notice
provision
if
sales
are
made
outside
of
the
bona
fide
charter.
i
might
suggest
to
you
that--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--yes.
i
might
suggest
to
you
that
under
the
asgrow's
interpretation,
that
phrase
is
superfluous.
it
certainly
contradicts
their
interpretation,
and
it's
consistent
with
our
interpretation
that
that--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--yes.
if
there's...
it's
in
the
last
sentence.
the
phrase
that--
mr.
william
h.
bode
--it's
the
phrase
that
states--
mr.
william
h.
bode
"#
shall
be
deemed
to
have
notice.
"
you
see,
that's
consistent
with
our
interpretation,
because
there's
no
notice
required.
why?
because
the
first
sentence
exempts
that
infringing
act
with
respect
to
seed
sold
for
reproductive
purposes,
seed
sold
in
the
second
sentence.
if
that
weren't
so,
then
you
would...
you
would
have
no
purpose
for
that
last
sentence.
it
would...
it
would
be
meaningless.
mr.
william
h.
bode
that's
my
point.
the
first
sentence
and
the
second
sentence
and
the
third
sentence
are
all
one,
unified
section.
there's
no
independent,
separate
crop
exemption,
as
asgrow
suggests
at
page
5
of
its
brief,
and
therefore
it's
inapplicable
to
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
bode
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
