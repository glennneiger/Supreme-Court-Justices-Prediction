mr.
bode,
you
made
an
argument
a
little
earlier,
i've
been
trying
to
figure
it
out,
based
on
the
sentence...
i
guess
you
say
it's
the
second
sentence,
a
bona
fide
sale
for
other
than
reproductive
purposes
made...
i
think
you
said
that
under
the
petitioner's
interpretation
that
becomes
redundant,
was
that
your
point,
but
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
be
flight
of
life,
wednesday
we’ve
announced
decisions
about
termite
frequent
flyers
annuities
and
flee
bargaining.
this
one
is
about
farming.
it
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
asgrow
seed
company,
company
which
has
protected
two
varieties
of
soybean
seed
under
the
plant
variety
protection
act
of
1970
which
protect
owners
of
novel
seed
varieties
from
unauthorized
sale
of
their
seed
for
replanting
purposes.
the
respondent,
iowa
farmers,
planted
265
acres
of
asgrow’s
protected
soybeans
and
disposes
the
entire
salable
crop
my
making
so
called
“brown-bag”
sales
of
the
soybeans
to
other
farmers
for
use
as
seed,
enough
seed
to
plant
about
10,000
acres.
petitioners
sued
respondent
in
federal
district
court
contending
that
these
actions
violated
the
act.
respondent
sought
refuge
in
an
exemption
from
infringement
liability
found
in
section
2543
of
the
act
which
permits
farmers
to
make
some
sales
as
seeds
descended
from
protected
variety
seed
to
other
farmers
for
planting
purposes.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
asgrow
holding
that
the
exemptions
allows
a
farmer
to
save
and
resale
to
other
farmers
only
the
amount
of
seed
from
his
crop
that
he
would
need
to
replant
his
own
fields.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
exemption
permits
the
farmer
to
sell
up
to
half
of
every
crop
he
produces
from
protected
seed
varieties
for
planting
purposes.
so,
as
long
as
he
sells
the
other
half
for
food
or
for
feed
we
reverse
that
judgment.
the
exemption
set
for
us
in
the
proviso
to
section
2543
allows
a
farmer
to
sell
through
other
farmers
seed
which
he
has
cleaned
and
saved
for
planting
purposes.
however,
the
structure
of
the
sentence
is
such
that
this
authorization
does
not
extend
to
saved
seed
that
was
grown
for
the
very
purpose
of
selling
it
for
planting
because
that
would
violate
another
provision
section
2541(3).
as
a
practical
matter
this
means
that
the
only
crop
seed
a
farmer
can
resell
for
planting
is
that
which
he
has
saved
to
replant
his
own
fields.
thus
the
proviso
allows
a
farmer
who
saves
seeds
to
replant
his
acreage
but
later
changes
his
plans
to
sell
that
seed
for
reproductive
purposes.
it
does
not
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
authorize
farmers
to
engage
in
direct
competition
with
the
owners
of
the
novel
variety
by
selling
virtually
limitless
quantities
of
seed
to
other
farmers.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
