chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
93-1841,
adarand
constructors,
inc.,
v.
federico
pena,
secretary
of
transportation.
mr.
pendley.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
thank
you,
mr.
pendley.
general
days,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
days,
why
couldn't
congress
have
done
this
without
a
presumption,
and
just
said
that
if
the
dbe
can
show
factual
economic
disadvantage,
it
gets
the
benefit,
but
not
use
any
presumption?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
really
a
matter
of
administrative
convenience?
they
figured
it
would
come
out
this
way
in
the
majority
of
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
congress,
then,
was
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
perhaps
people
who
had
not
been
in
fact
economically
disadvantaged
might,
because
of
the
presumption,
nonetheless
get
the
benefit
of
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
"that",
what
do
you
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
competing
subcontractors?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no,
general
days.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
how
can
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
give
congress
authority
to
lessen
the
effect
of
that
amendment
on
congressional
actions?
there's...
i
think
there's
a
statement
in
the
katzenbach
case
that
congress
can
move
in
only
one
direction
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
could
make
the
standards
more
stringent,
but
not
less
stringent.
but
your
argument
is
in
effect
that
congress
can
make
the
standards
less
stringent
when
applied
to
congress.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
that
the
equal
protection
component,
let's
say,
of
the
fifteenth...
of
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
less
demanding
on
congress.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
the
states
look
for
when
they
conduct
their
annual
review,
or
is
it
possible
to
generalize
as
to
all
50
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
the
provision
that
would
require
or
permit
that
in
the
regulations,
or
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the...
a
lot
of
that,
at
least
14
and
15,
is
initiated
by
a
competitor.
i
gather
in
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
that
there
is
some
government-initiated
process
which
reviews
these
certifications?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
in
the
briefs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
days.
mr.
pendley,
you
have
4
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pendley.
the
case
is
submitted.
