okay.
unknown
speaker
general
days,
let
me
give
you--
--are
you
referring
just
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
presumption,
which
is
quite
an
important
part
of
the
case?
would
you
legal
argument
be
different
if,
instead
of
a
presumption,
the
statute
said
that
the
person
seeking
a
dba
certification
could
put
in
evidence
of
discrimination
against
other
members
of
that
person's
race
to
attempt
to
make
the
showing,
and
that
the
trial...
that
the
fact-finder
would
be
entitled
to
rely
on
such
evidence?
would
that
be
a
different
case?
