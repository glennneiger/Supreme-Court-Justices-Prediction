general
days,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
regulations?
do
the
regulations
contain
any
provisions
requiring
the
states,
or
whatever
the
agency
is
that
designates
a
particular
business
as
a
dbe
to
review
its
status
from
time
to
time,
or
is
it
once
designated
you
have
that
privilege
forever?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
about
a
specific
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
a
subcontractor
repeatedly
got
preferential
treatment
for
a
year
or
so
and
increased
its
gross
sales
from
100,000
to
20
million.
would
that
be
a
factor
that
would...
and
be
exactly
the
same
racial
composition
of
the
company.
would
it
be
apt
to
lose
its
certification
if
it
had
that
kind
of
business
growth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pendley--
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
permissible,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
tight
fit
would
be
that
an
afro-american
would
prove
that
a
lot
of
other
afro-americans
had
been
discriminated
against,
but
this
one
never
suffered
any
discrimination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
a
permissible
showing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
really
isn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
not
the
presumption
that
is
critical
but,
rather,
the
relevance
of
the
discrimination
against
other
members
of
the
race?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
that's
an
irrelevant
factor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
state
of
colorado's
presump...
certification,
is
that
permanent,
or
is
that
subject
to
periodic
review,
when
the
state
certifies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
anything
on
the
form
about
financial
success?
