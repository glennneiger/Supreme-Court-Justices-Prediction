mr.
william
perry
pendley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
adarand
is
a
small,
family-owned
corporation
that
does
business
in
colorado
springs,
colorado.
it
is
owned
by
and
operated
by
randy
pech,
his
wife
valerie,
his
mom
ruth,
and
their
friend
and
partner,
steve
gaglan.
in
the
year
surrounding
the
events
that
led
to
this
action,
adarand's
annual
average
gross
receipts
were
approximately
$900,000,
but
their
average
annual
net
profits
was
but
$30,000.
in
fact,
in
the
year
before
this
event,
they
had
a
net
negative
cash
flow
of
some
$20,000.
adarand
specializes
in
the
construction
of
highway
guardrails,
primarily
as
a
result
of
the
receipt
of
subcontracts
from
prime
contractors.
in
1989,
adarand
submitted
a
bid
to
do
the
guardrail
work
on
the
subcontract
as
a
subcontractor
along
4.7
miles
of
highway
in
the
san
juan
national
forest
in
extreme
southwestern
colorado.
although
it
submitted
the
lowest
bid,
and
although
it
has
an
excellent
reputation
for
doing
quality
work
on
a
timely
basis
its
bid
was
rejected
by
operation
of
the
statute
questioned
here,
a
statute
which
presumes
that
all
members
of
certain
enumerated
racial
and
ethnic
groups
are
socially
and
economically
disadvantaged.
adarand
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied
to
him
in
the
loss
of
this
$20,000
contract.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
when
we
look
at
the
statement
by
mountain
sand
and
gravel
at
page
30
and
31
of
the
joint
appendix,
mountain
sand
and
gravel
says,
but
for
the
scc,
the
subcontractor
compensation
clause,
adarand
would
have
received
the
contract.
but--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--no.
that
is
clear
by
other
means,
justice
souter.
there
are
several
means:
1)
adarand,
randy
pech
testified
that
in
fact
it
was
the
operation
of
the
presumption.
he
said,
gonzales
is
a
dbe
because
he
is
a
minority.
in
addition,
we
have
the
testimony
that's
contained
in
the
appendix
in
the
reply,
at
pages
7,
9
and
10,
and
14,
where
three
government
officials
testified
they
knew
of
no
circumstance
under
which
anybody
had
been
a
dbe
for
any
other
reason
than
the
operation
of
the
presumption.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
there...
justice
souter,
there
were
no
genuine
issues
of
material
fact
remaining
in
the
dispute.
as
page
31
of
the
appendix
in
our
petition
for
writ
of
cert
makes
clear,
both
parties
on
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment
stipulated
to
all
the
facts,
or
agreed
there
were
no
genuine
issues
of
material
fact
remaining
in
dispute.
one
of
those
issues
would
have
been
the
subcontracting
compensation
clause's
operation.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
we're
challenging
the...
several
statutes.
we're
challenging
section
502
of
the
small
business
act,
which
is
section
644(g),
which
is
contained
at
page
11-a
of
the
government's
brief.
in
addition,
that...
there
is
section
637(d),
which
is
on
page
11
of
the
government's
appendix,
which
sets
out
the
presumption,
and
that
presumption
is
applied
to
644(g)
because
of
the
appropriation
in
the
sturaa,
what's
called
the
sturaa,
the
surface
transportation
and
uniform
relocation
assistance
act,
which
is
at
page
16-a
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
no,
justice
ginsburg,
it
does
not,
simply
the
presumption
under
this
federal
highway
set-aside,
which
is
a
direct
funding
program.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
we...
no,
justice
o'connor.
we
believe
that
we
could
go
back
and
seek
relief.
we--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--we
seek
such
other...
such
other
relief
as
may
be
just
and
equitable
under
the
premises,
and
that's
on
page
24.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
we
are
seeking
both,
your
honor.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
well,
justice
o'connor,
we
believe
that
there
is
plenty
of
evidence,
that
they
know
of
no
other
basis
that
anyone
in
colorado
was
certified
as
a
dbe,
except
for
the
presumption.
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
that's
very
important,
justice
o'connor,
is
because
section
108,
the
subcontracting
compensation
clause,
requires
the
prime
contractor
to
provide
to
the
federal
government
a
copy
of
the
dbe
certification,
so
the
federal
officials
involved
in
this
program
have
known
from
the
very
beginning
the
basis
upon
which
the
certification
took
place,
which
adds
increased
importance
to
their
testimony
that
they
knew
of
no
situation
in
which
dbe's
were
certified
by
any
other
way
than
the
presumption.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
his
injury,
justice
o'connor,
is
the
fact
that
he
cannot
compete
on
an
equal
footing,
as
this
court
held
in
the
jacksonville
case,
that
that
is
the
harm,
that
is
the
harm,
direct
harm--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--i
don't
believe
so,
justice
o'connor.
but
what
mr.
pech
has
testified
is,
he
bids
on
every
single
contract
in
colorado.
every
single
guardrail
contract
in
colorado,
he
bids
on
those
projects,
and
as
long
as
there
is
a
subcontractor
compensation
clause
in
the
provision
that
prevents
him
from
competing
on
an
equal
footing,
he
will
be
unable
to
compete.
in
fact,
he
presented
evidence
in
response
to
the
government's
interrogatory
number
22
that
showed
he
had
lost
some
12
contracts
already
as
a
result
of
the
application
of
the
socially
and
economically
disadvantaged--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--yes,
your
honor,
justice
kennedy.
the
testimony
from
the
government
in
response
to
one
of
our
interrogatories
was
there
were
some
87
contracts
let
that
contained
guardrail
work.
of
those,
64
were
given
to
subcontractors
to
do,
and
of
that,
43
percent
of
that
number
went
to
dbe's,
and
that's
consistent
with
the
documents
provided
by
the
l.
s.
lee
amicus
brief,
where
they
point
to
the
general
accounting
office
report
that
shows
that
in
many
of
these
states...
for
example
in
colorado,
78
percent
of
the
traffic
signaling
is
going
to
dbe's.
in
connecticut,
90
percent
of
the
guardrails
and
fencing
is
going
to
dbe's.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
he
bids
on
every
one
that
has
a
guardrail,
depending
on
the
bid.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
the...
excuse
me,
your
honor,
the
floor
as
to
the--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--oh,
flaw.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
it's
my
hearing.
we
assert
that
the
flaw
is
the
presumption.
the
presumption--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--i
believe
that
we
did,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
there's
a
dearth
of
findings
when
one
examines
the
congressional
record.
basically,
what
we're
dealing
with
here
are
situations
where
there's
a
piggy-back
on
the
sba
administrative
relief
that
was
fashioned,
a
piggy-back
on
the
public
works
employment
act
that
this
court
considered
in
fullilove,
and
a
continuing
piggy-back
without
any
analysis
as
to
what
is
the
today
situation.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
i
think
that
fullilove
is
distinguishable,
your
honor,
with
regard
to
what
the
court
permitted.
there,
of
course,
as
you
know
it
was
a
facial
challenge,
and--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--yes.
well,
i'm
trying
to
answer
that,
justice...
excuse
me.
i
hope
this
is
the
answer,
and
the
answer
is
that
it
was
a
facial
challenge,
and
so
justice...
chief
justice
burger
insisted
that
he
had...
the
court
had
reasonable
assurances
that
the
administrative
process
would
be
operating
effectively
and
properly,
it
would
be
narrowly
limited,
it
would
be
limited
to
the
situations
in
which
it
applied,
in
fact,
as
amicus
pacific
legal
foundation
points
out
in
footnote
44,
it
was
very
clear...
44
of
the
fullilove
brief,
opinion...
it
was
very
clear
that
it
was
only
going
to
apply
to
minorities
who
were
disadvantaged.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
adequate
findings
here.
i
think
what
one
has
to
look
at...
the
court
should
look
at
is
the
appendix
b
of
the
government's
brief,
where
they
set...
where
it
sets
out
what
they
think
is
the
best...
its
best
shot
at
demonstrating
the
findings.
and
one
looks
at
pages
21
and
23,
for
example,
and
we
hear
again
the
litany
of
problems
that
small
businesses
like
adarand
face,
problems
getting
bonding,
problems
getting
certification,
problems
dealing
with
government
paperwork,
problems
getting
paid
by
prime
on
time,
these
are
problems
that
cut,
as
the
court
has
said
in
the
past,
not
across
racial
lines
but
across
business
on
size
lines.
that's
really
the
issue.
when
congress
makes
findings
like
that,
they
are
so
amorphous
as
to
be
limitless.
in
addition,
the
government
points
to
two
specific
things:
1)
problems
with
trade
unions
in
new
york,
and
2)
problems
with
state
officials
in
illinois.
now,
it
seems
that
those
cry
out
for
race-neutral
resolution,
that
those
are
issues
that
can
be
dealt
with
on
a
case-specific
basis
to
end
whatever
problems
are
occurring
with
trade
unions
or
with
state
officials
who
are
violating
the
law.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
oh,
i
think
that's
the
aspirational
goal,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
congress
be
victim-specific.
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
continuum
that
spreads
out
there,
we
have
a
victim-specific
remedy,
and
at
the
other
end
we
have
a
total
indifference
to
the
nature
of
the
victims,
if
they
are,
and
whether
or
not
they've
suffered.
that's
what
we
have
here,
total
indifference.
i
mean,
we
have
a
situation
here
where
a
hong
kong
banker,
a
japanese
electrical
engineer,
or
the
son
of
landed
gentry
from
spain
could
come
to
colorado
springs,
buy
51
percent
of
adarand,
and
turn
it
into
a
dbe.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
that's
the
government's--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--your
honor,
it
is
sufficient.
under
the
regulations
the
government
has
set
forward,
and
it's
discussed
on
page--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--the
way
the
regulations
are.
the
way--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--yes.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
in
this
situation,
justice
o'connor,
the
certification
was
by
the
states,
and--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--excuse
me.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
it
goes
a
lot
further
than
the
current
situation,
which
is
totally
indifferent
to
any...
any
injustice,
or--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--i
don't
think
the
regulations
can
be
read
that
way.
in
fact,
they
specifically
say,
there's...
in
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
that
we
discuss
on
page
22
of...
i
believe
it's
page
22
of
our
brief,
where
the
government
says...
talking
about
the
proposed
rulemaking
coming
out
on
certification,
and
it
says,
we've
had
inquiries
from
states
saying,
what
do
we
do,
do
we
inquire
into
the
economic
status
of
these
organizations?
and
the
answer
is,
states,
you
don't
do
that.
once
you
have
determined
that
this
applicant
is
a
member
of
one
of
the
identified
racial
groups,
the
inquiry
ends.
that
individual,
that
organization
is
certified.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
the
rules
permit
a
third
party
to
challenge
the
presumption,
but
as
pacific
legal
foundation
points
out
in
their
amicus
brief,
that's
not
consistent
with
the
real
world.
i
think
the
first
question
is,
is
it
fair,
is
it
right
to
ensure
the
equal
protection
guarantees
be
put
on
the
back
of
an
adarand,
rather
than
on
the
government,
which
is
dispensing
these
benefits,
and
the
benefited
party?
in
addition,
the
difficulty
an
adarand
has,
first
of
all,
judge
posner...
as
the
amicus
association
of
general
contractors'
brief
points
out,
discussing
judge
posner's
point
that
what
if
we
had
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
blacks
could
not
do
highway
construction
work?
that
would
be
odious
and
offensive
on
its
face,
even
if
it
was
rebuttable.
the
irony
here,
in
comparison
is
in
that
situation,
the
black
contractor
is
in
possession
of
the
knowledge
necessary
to
rebut
the
presumption.
here
an
adarand,
without
subpoena
power,
without
any
ability
to
gather
the
information,
is
incapable
of
challenging
the
presumption.
in
addition,
i
think
he
exposes
himself
to
being
a
litigious
entity
vis-a-vis
other
companies.
the
last
thing
you
want
in
the
highway
contracting
business
is
to
know
the
guy
you're
dealing
with
is
litigious.
in
addition,
a
possible
lawsuit
for
deformation
by
the
dbe...
as
the
solicitor
general
points
out
in
his
brief,
that's
a
criminal
violation,
to
hold
oneself
out
falsely
as
a
dbe.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
justice
breyer,
the
problem
with
it
is,
it's
an
impermissible
stereotype.
it's
a
racial
stereotype
that
presumes
that
every
member
of
one
of
these
listed
groups...
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
we
have
26
nation...
member,
individual--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
overrule
any
case.
i
think
this
is
totally
consistent
with
the
traditional
test
that
was
espoused
in
a
number
of
cases
the
court
has
embraced
with
regard
to
equal
protection,
and
it's
consistent
with
all
of
those
cases.
i
would
distinguish
metro
on
the
basis
that
we're
not
talking
about
a
gross
public
benefit
to
the
nation,
because
the
court
found
there
was
a
nexus
between
the
ownership
of
television
stations
and
what
is
broadcast--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--your
honor?
mr.
william
perry
pendley
fullilove
does
seem
the
most
obvious,
and
as
this
court
indicated
in
the
dissent...
some
justices
indicated
in
the
dissent
in
metro,
at
least
six
justices
wanted
something
approaching
strict
scrutiny.
the
triggering
mechanism
is,
we
have
a
stereotype
that
is
so
rarely
relevant--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--no.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
because
in
fullilove
it
was
a
totally
different
factual
situation.
it
was
an
as-applied
challenge.
the
regulations
had
come
out
in
october,
and
in
november
the
parties
filed
the
lawsuit.
we
have
a
situation
where
it's
actually
been
applied.
we
have
the
testimony
of
the
officials
as
to
how
it's
being
applied,
the
fact
that
they
can't
get
waivers,
they
don't
get
waivers,
the
fact
that
we
have
a
15
to
18-percent
set-aside,
and
the
fact
there's
a
presumption
that
operates,
all
of
these
things
are
distinguishable
from
the
factual
situation
in
fullilove.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
yes.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
yes.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
in
the
fullilove
case,
justice...
chief
justice
burger's
opinion
is
filled
with
references
to
the
flexibility
of
the
program,
the
waivers
in
the
program,
how
they
can
get
out
from
under
it,
the
ceilings
of
the
program,
how
they
could
not
give
to
dbe's
in
improper
situations,
so
it
was
a
very
flexible
program.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
the
prime
contractor,
justice--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--ginsburg?
the
prime
contractor
is
economically
compelled.
i
would
think
it
would
be
comparable
to,
say,
the
arlington
heights
case,
where
if
the
city,
instead
of
passing
a
zoning
change,
actually
said
we're
going
to
pay
$1,000
to
every
homeowner,
$1,000
more
if
that
homeowner
will
not
sell
to
a
minority.
that's
the
situation
we
have
here.
the
prime
contractor
is
being
told,
you'll
get
a
$10,000
bonus
if
you
give
this
contract
to
one
of
our
dbe's
instead
of
the
low-bidding
adarand.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
the
report
that
the
highway
department
did,
it's
a
1985
report
that's
entered
into
the
record,
a
1985
highway
report,
they
said
their
discussions
with
contractors,
with
prime
contractors
is
that
the
subcontractors,
they
don't
have
to
find
them,
the
subcontractors,
the
dbe's
come
looking
for
them.
in
addition,
the
dbe's
testified,
we
don't
need
the
help.
that's
all
very
nice
to
have
the
help,
but
we're
fine.
we're
perfectly
capable
of
doing
this
job.
we
don't
need
that
assistance.
so
in
addition,
i
also
think
on
its
face
that's
an
impermissible
racial
stereotype
to
say,
jeez,
all
these
dbe's
out
there
are
so
incompetent
that
they
need
the
help,
when
the
fact
is
they
don't.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
justice...
chief
justice...
this...
yes.
this
arrangement
is
not.
chief
justice
burger
said...
if
fullilove
pushes
the
outer
limits...
he
says,
just
because
it
pushes
the
outer
limits,
there's
no
reason
to
strike
it.
this
is
going
over
the
edge.
this
adarand
program--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--yes.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
justice
souter,
i
believe
it
goes
beyond
because
it
puts
the
burden
on
the
wrong
party.
it
puts
the
burden
on
a
party
who's
incapable
of
disproving
it
himself.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
no.
they
could
be
challenged
in
fullilove.
certification
could
be
challenged
in
fullilove.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
whether
or
not
the
parties
participating
were
authorized
to
participate
and
fell
within
the
definition,
but
the
point
here
is--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--of
a--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--mbe.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
here,
the
rebuttable
presumption,
the
burden
falls
upon
the
adarands
of
the
world
to
challenge
it.
if
the
burden
is
upon
the
adarands
of
the
world
to
assure
equal
protection,
that's
not
going
to
happen.
they
just
simply--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--the
presumption,
your
honor,
is
of
membership
in
the
race,
is
a
presumption
of
socially
harmed
and
economically
disadvantaged.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
yes.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
yes,
your
honor,
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
regard
to
the
presumption,
the
reason
the
presumption
wasn't
opposed,
mr.
justice
scalia,
is
because
from
the
beginning,
from
the
get-go
and
the
origin
in
this
case,
the
government
knew
the
presumption
worked,
and
that
was
the
assumption
all
the
way
through--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--this
process.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
i
think
that
would
be
an
absolutely
different
case.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
to
the
extent
that
congress
set
up
some
fact-finding
that
was
necessary,
some
level
that
was
necessary,
some
hurdle
that
had
some
meaning
that
there
was...
so
one
could
see
if
there
was
a
tight
fit
between
the
discrimination
and
the
remedy.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
no,
i...
that--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
no.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
i
think
it
has
to
be...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
exactly,
your
honor.
we--
mr.
william
perry
pendley
--as
i
pointed
out,
we
have
people
from
hong
kong
who
come
to
this
country
under
this,
26
asian
nations
that
are
listed.
the
presumption
was
never
challenged.
the
federal
officials
testified
it
was
the
operation
of
the
presumption.
in
our
reply
on
pages
7,
9,
10,
and
14,
it's
set
forth
where
they
said
that,
and
they
said
that
because
they
had
the
documents.
they
knew
that
it
was
the
presumption
that
was
working,
and
had
it,
and
that's
why
they
didn't
raise
it
until
this
last
point.
we
did
challenge
sturaa
in
our
complaint,
because...

of
the
complaint.
the
solicitor
general
is
correct,
others
may
qualify
for
this
program,
but
i
draw
the
court's
attention
to
page
212
of
part
23,
subpart
d,
appendix
a,
where
they
list
the
vietnam
veteran,
the
appalachian
white,
the
ascetic
jews,
but
said
it
must
be
emphasized
that
these
individuals
are
not
determined
to
be
socially
and
economically
disadvantaged
on
the
basis
of
their
group
membership,
rather
of
the
social
and
economic
disadvantage
of
each
must
be
determined
on
an
individual,
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
no,
your
honor.
that's
victim-specific.
that's
what
this
court
has
said
is
permissible,
but
here...
and
that's
the
difference
here.
those
in
the
presumption
group
step
forward,
prove
their
race.
those
in
the
nonpresumptive
group
step
forward
and
prove,
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
that
they
qualify.
the
government
cites
to
its
footnote
15,
with
regard
to
the
state's
annual
review,
this
is
a
regulation
that
applies
to
the
administrator
of
the
sba.
gonzales
was
certified
by
the
state
of
colorado,
not
under
this
program,
and
not
under
this.
in
fact,
the
regulations
are
very
clear
with
regard
to
what
is
required.
i
draw
the
court's
attention
to
page
23
of
our
brief,
footnote
20.
in
making
the
certification
decision,
the
recipient,
that's
the
state,
relies
on
this
presumption
and
does
not
investigate
the
social
and
economic
status
of
individuals
who
fall
into
one
of
the
presumptive
groups.
mr.
william
perry
pendley
i
believe
they
come
for
it
annually,
your
honor,
but
the
form
simply
says,
1)
is
it
what
percent
owned,
2)
check
your
race,

mr.
william
perry
pendley
--it
asks
the
question,

the
applicant
socially
and
economically
disadvantaged
under
the
sba
program,
and
in
this
case,
gonzales
checked
no.
the...
i
want
to
say
something
about
the
challenge
and
the
protest.
first
of
all,
when
an
adarand
challenges,
what
happens?
the
first
thing
that
happens
is
the
contracting
officer
stops
the
contract,
and
he
infuriates
the
prime
contractor.
number
2,
the
dbe
presumption
continues
in
place,
so
this
dbe
continues
to
be
able
to
bid
on
other
projects
until
the
process
is
over,
and
frankly,
when
one
examines
the
amorphous
basis
upon
which
one
is
socially
and
economically
disadvantaged
under
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
it's
hard
to
imagine
how
an
adarand
could
defeat
the
presumption.
thank
you,
your
honor.
