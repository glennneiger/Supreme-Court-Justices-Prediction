justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
the
statute,
and
there
are
several
statutes
under
which
one
can
be
certified.
can
you
tell
us
which
of
the
statutes
you
are
challenging
in
this
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
challenging
what
has
been
called
the
8(a)
certification,
or
are
you...
does
that
enter
into
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
fullilove
involved
a
straight-out
set-aside,
no
flexibility
at
all,
and
it
seems
that
this
program
is
about
the
most
flexible,
rebuttable
presumption...
i
thought
you
were
making
both
a
facial
challenge
first--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
let's
just
take
that
facial
challenge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
facial
challenge,
to
agree
with
you,
mustn't
we
overrule
fullilove?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
can
you
take
both
statutes
on
their
face
and
say
the
one
that
has
an
absolute
10-percent
set-aside
is
good,
and
the
other,
that
has
a
rebuttable
presumption,
that
has
a
concept
of
economic
disadvantage,
that
is
not
race-specific,
that
that
one
is
no
good?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here,
the
contractor
doesn't
even
have
to
have
anything
to
do
with
any
dbe,
the
successful
bidder
on
the
government
project,
isn't
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
congress
described
that
not
as
a
bonus
but...
am
i
wrong
in
recalling
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
cost
compensation,
recognizing
that
it
would
be
an
additional
cost
for
the
principal
contractor
to
take
on
a
subcontractor
that
didn't
have
secure
credit
and
that
might
have
to
have
some
assistance
in
dealing
with
labor
problems
and
the
like?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's...
you
said
that
on...
that
although
fullilove
was
okay
under
the
constitution
on
its
face,
this
arrangement
is
not.
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
fullilove
you
could
show
that
the
minority
status
claim
was
a
sham,
perhaps,
but
here,
it's
disadvantage,
you
can
say.
minority,
yes,
but
disadvantaged,
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
days,
i
believe
mr.
pendley
said
he's
not
challenging
the
8(a)
certification
program,
and
it
does
seem
that
there's
a
big
difference
when
you
get
to
economic
disadvantage,
that
it's
not
automatic
under
8(a).
am
i
right
in
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
there's
a
presumption
under
8(d)
that
if
nobody
challenges
it
just
sticks
based
on
minority
status,
but
that's
not
so
for
8(a)
certification?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
days,
am
i
right
that
adarand
in
fact
couldn't
bring
such
a
lawsuit
because
it
doesn't...
there,
there
would
be
no
standing.
isn't
it
only
the
procurement
officer
in
the
8(d)
program?
does
someone
in
the
position
of
adarand
have
a
right
to
sue
the
successful
bidder...
i
mean,
the
successful
dbe?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
only
thing
that
someone
in
adarand's
position
could
do
is
to
say,
procurement
officer,
there's
a
problem
here.
you
look
into
it.
