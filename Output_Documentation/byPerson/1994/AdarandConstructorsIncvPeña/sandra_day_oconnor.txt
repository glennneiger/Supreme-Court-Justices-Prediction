justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask,
mr.
pendley,
the
plaintiff
is
not
suing
for
the...
for
damages
or
any
backward-looking
relief
for
this
particular
contract,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
that
was
not
sought,
and
is
not
sought
in
this
suit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
you
were
seeking
an
injunction
and
forward-looking
relief.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
solicitor
general
takes
the
position
that
the
petitioner
lacks
standing
for
a
failure
to
show
that
the
presumption
was
applied
here,
or
if
it
was,
that
it
was
applied
incorrectly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
did
the
petitioner
show
would
be
his
future
damages,
or
the
injury
to
be
suffered
in
the
future?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
jacksonville,
was
there
some
backward-looking
relief
being
sought?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
contend
that
congress
failed
to
make
adequate
findings
concerning
racial
discrimination
in
the
construction
industry
to
support
the
legislation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
fullilove
spoke
at
some
length
on
the
adequacy
of
congressional
findings.
do
you
think
that
has
a
bearing
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
talking
about
the
findings
of
congress.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
goes
to
the
tailoring.
i
don't
think
that
goes
to
whether
there
were
adequate
findings
of
racial
discrimination,
and
fullilove
spoke
to
the
congressional
findings
of
discrimination
in
the
construction
industry.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
regulations
read
as
though
the
sba
will
issue
a
certification
only
if
the
business
shows
it
meets
the
definition
of
economic
disadvantage,
and
does
that
mean
that
each
participant
has
to
personally
demonstrate
harm
from
discrimination
to
qualify?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
that
were
the
regulatory
scheme--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
each
individual
would
have
to
show
a
demonstration
of
harm
from
discrimination
to
qualify?
does
that
meet
your
objections,
if
that
were
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
regulations
could
be
read
to
require
just
that
and
i
wondered,
if
they
did,
what
your
view
of
them
might
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
standard
we
apply
in
reviewing
this
scheme?
is
it
strict
scrutiny?
is
that
the
position
you
take?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
days,
as
a
practical
matter,
how
does
a
third
party
go
about
challenging
the
economic
disadvantage
presumption
as
applied
to
a
particular
contractor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
how
would
you
know
which
one?
i
mean,
you
have
a
particular
bid
situation.
there
is
a
job
going
out
for
bid.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
does
someone
like
petitioner
know
that
from
that
long
list
a
particular
one
is
going
to
be
trying
to
get
the
certification
and
therefore
that's
the
one
that
should
be
challenged?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
the
petitioner
know
that
gonzales
had
been
identified?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there's
no
mechanism
to
let
the
petitioner
know
in
a
particular
situation
that
this
is
the
one
to
focus
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
makes
it
much
harder
to
upset,
i
suppose,
after
the
fact.
are
you
aware
of
any
instances
where
third
parties
have
successfully
challenged--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--one
of
these
certifications?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
second
case,
i
have
to
announce
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
adarand
constructors.
it
challenges
federal
statues
and
regulations
that
give
firms
control
by
members
of
certain
racial
group
an
advantage
in
bidding
on
government
contracts.
adarand
claims
that
the
race
based
presumptions
contained
in
the
statutes
and
regulations
violate
the
guarantee
of
equal
protection
contained
in
fifth
amendment’s
due
process
clause.
the
districts
court
rules
in
favor
of
the
government.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
tenth
circuit
affirmed.
in
so
doing,
the
court
of
appeals
applied
a
lenient
intermediate
standard
of
review
to
the
racial
classifications
of
that
issue,
relying
on
our
decisions
in
fullilove
v.
klutznick
and
metro
broadcasting,
inc.
v.
fcc.we
granted
the
petition
of
adarand
constructors
for
certiorari,
and
we
now
vacate
the
court
of
appeals’
judgment
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
we
have
long
recognized
that
equal
protection
of
the
laws
is
a
personal
right,
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
to
every
individual.
we
have
also
recognized
that
laws
classifying
citizens
by
race
pose
an
especially
grave
threat
to
that
right,
because
in
most
cases
there
is
no
good
reason
for
government,
federal
or
state,
to
distinguish
between
citizens
on
the
basis
of
race.
as
we
explain
in
today’s
opinion
that
basic
principle
of
equal
protection
as
a
personal
right
is
the
basis
for
a
long
line
for
our
cases,
establishing
that
all
racial
classifications
are
suspect
and
to
be
carefully
reviewed
by
courts.
that
the
standard
of
review
of
racial
classifications
does
not
change,
depending
on
the
race
of
the
effected
persons
and
that
equal
protection
analysis
is
the
same
for
federal
and
state
governments.
after
a
1989
decision
in
richmond
v.
j.
a.
croson
co,
which
held
that
all
state
imposed
racial
classifications
must
be
reviewed
under
strict
scrutiny.
one
might
have
expected
that
federal
racial
classifications
would
be
subject
to
the
same
strict
standard.
in
1990,
however,
in
the
case
of
metro
broadcasting,
inc.
v.
fcc,
this
court
held
that
certain
racial
classifications
enacted
by
the
federal
government
were
subject
only
to
intermediate
scrutiny.
in
so
doing,
the
case
reopened
matters
that
our
precious
cases
seem
to
have
settled,
and
we
can
be
underlying
principle
that
equal
protection
is
a
personal
right
applicable
to
all
persons
of
all
races.
we
hold
today
that
metro
broadcasting’s
departure
from
that
principle
was
a
mistake
of
sufficient
magnitude
that
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
does
not
require
adherence
to
it,
and
we
therefore,
overruled
metro
broadcasting.
in
so
far
as
it
held
certain
racial
classifications
to
an
intermediate
standard
of
review.
henceforth,
the
single
standard
of
the
strict
scrutiny
applies
to
all
racial
classifications
imposed
by
whatever
federal
state
or
local
government
actor.
we
make
clear
however
that
the
strict
scrutiny
is
not
strict
in
theory,
but
they
hold
in
fact.
we
recognize
the
unhappy
persistence
of
both
the
practice
and
the
lingering
effects
of
racial
discrimination
against
minority
groups
in
this
country,
and
nothing
we
say
today
disqualifies
government
from
acting
in
response
to
it.
the
purpose
of
strict
scrutiny
is
to
afford
all
racial
classifications,
a
careful
and
searching
review,
in
order
to
distinguish
legitimate
from
illegitimate
use
of
race
in
governmental
decision
making.
when
that
careful
review
shows
that
a
racial
classification
serves
a
compelling
state
interest
and
is
narrowly
tailored
to
further
that
interest,
the
classification
as
constitutional.
moving
then
this
case
for
the
lower
courts
to
decide
in
the
first
instance,
whether
the
program
challenged
here
can
be
at
standard.
the
opinion
is
for
the
court
accepting
so
far
as
that
might
be
in
consistent
with
the
views
expressed
in
justice
scalia’s
concurring
statement,
and
except
for
part
3c,
which
is
joined
by
only
two
members
of
the
court.
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
have
each
filed
opinions
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg

justice
souter
has
filed

in
which
