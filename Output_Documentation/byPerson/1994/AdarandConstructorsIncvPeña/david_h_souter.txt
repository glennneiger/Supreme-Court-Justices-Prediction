justice
david
h.
souter
does
that
clarify
that
it
was
the
presumption
that
was
crucial
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
the
judge
take
that...
make
that
a
finding
that
that
was
an
undisputed
material
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
pendley,
i'm
still
trying
to
get
clear
on
the
significance
of
what
we
have
for
the
standing
issue.
let
me
go
back
behind
the
summary
judgment
motion
to
the
complaint.
did
your
complaint
specify
the
presumption
as
being
the
flaw
in
the
statutory
scheme,
or
the
clause
as
being
the
flaw?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i...
flaw--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
constitutional
infirmity.
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
my
regional
accent.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
asserted
that
in
the
complaint?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
see
how
it
could
do
that,
because
i
thought
that
the
claim
had
to
be
one
of
specific
injury
to
this
particular
subcontractor,
by
virtue
of
membership
in
some
group.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess,
to
make
it
clear,
i
thought
group
membership
was
necessary,
but
it
was
not
sufficient.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
is
it
sufficient?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
start
with
the
statute.
under
the
statute,
would
it
be
sufficient
simply
to
be
a
member
of
a
group?
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
don't
see
why
this
has
gone
beyond
fullilove.
fullilove
had,
what
was
it,
a
10-percent
set-aside,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
this
has
got
is
a
presumption
of
specific
harm
to
a
specific
subcontractor
which
in
fact
is
rebuttable.
how
does
that
go
beyond
the
limit
of
fullilove?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
it
puts
the
burden.
in
fact,
it
gives
an
opportunity
to
rebut
which
in
fullilove
did
not
exist,
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
the
challenge
have
consisted
of?
i
just
don't
remember
this.
you'll
have
to
help
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
fell
within
the
definition
as--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
a
minority.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
in
fullilove,
the
criterion
was
simply
class
membership,
whereas
here
the
criterion
is
ultimately
actual
harm,
isn't
that
correct?
the
difference
between
mbe
and
dbe,
then...
this
is
called
disadvantaged.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
presumption
is
of
harm,
i.e.,
to
this
particular
contractor,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
to
this
particular
contractor.
i
mean,
that
was
your
answer,
as
i
understood
it,
to
justice
scalia.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
are
the
criteria--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
what
are
the
criteria
for
determining
whether
it
is
sufficiently
successful
to
be
discharged?
i
understood
that...
and
i
can't
remember
whether
this
was
a
matter
of
statute
or
reg,
that
if
the
average
net
income
for
a
period,
i
think
of
3
years,
was
above
a
certain
multimillion-dollar
amount,
that
there
would
no
longer
be
qualification
for
an
economically
disadvantaged
status.
are
there
other
criteria,
perhaps
considering
a
shorter
period
of
time,
for
example,
under
which
the
states
could
refuse
to
continue
certification?
if,
for
example,
a
given
contractor
went
from
making
a
$500,000
a
year
profit
to
a
100
million-dollars-a-year
profit
in
1
year,
would
that
be
a
basis
for
withdrawing
the
designation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about...
where
are
the...
where
would
we
find
the
criteria
which
the
state
agencies
would
use
to
de-designate?
