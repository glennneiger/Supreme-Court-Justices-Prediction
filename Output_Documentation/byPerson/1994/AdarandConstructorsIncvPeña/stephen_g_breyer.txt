of
course,
here,
we're
not
presuming
that
black
people
can't
work
on
highways.
the
presumption
is
that
a
person
who
is
black
has
suffered
prejudice
or
cultural
bias.
do
you
think
that
that's
an
unreasonable
presumption
as
a
matter
of
fact,
or
is
it
that
you're
saying,
assuming
that
it's
reasonable
as
a
matter
of
fact,
nonetheless
there
is
something
in
the
law
that
forbids
it?
i
take
it
you're
arguing
the
latter,
and
what,
precisely,
is
it
in
the
law
that
forbids
making
that
presumption
which
might
be
reasonable
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
how
many
cases
would
this
court
have
to
overrule,
if
any,
in
order
to
reach
that
proposition
of
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know
i'm
asking
you
a
legal
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
legal
question
i'm
asking...
of
course,
you
could
take
it
on
either
ground.
i
had
assumed
you
were
assuming
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
rational
to
assume
that
black
people
have
suffered
prejudice
or
cultural
bias.
if
that's
so,
what
is
it
in
the
law
that
would
prohibit
the
congress
or
the
department
of
transportation
from
making
that
factual
but
rebuttable
presumption,
particularly
given
past
supreme
court
cases?
in
other
words,
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
those?
are
we
supposed
to
overrule
those
past
cases?
is
it
that
it's
unreas...
i'm
trying
to
get
your
legal
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fullilove
is
the
most
obvious.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fullilove
would
seem
the
most
obvious.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry,
i'm
asking
would
this
court
have
to
overrule
fullilove?
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
might
be
wrong
about
this,
but
i...
correct
me
if
i...
but
my
impression
was
under
section
8(d),
which
is...
i
take
it
is
what
they're
challenging,
it's
the
procurement
officer
who
makes
the
challenge.
the
procuring
agency
contracting
officer,
and
that
what
the
other
contractors
do
is,
they
submit
information--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
that
officer,
and
i
take
it
that
could
be
confidential,
or
not,
i
don't
know
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
take
it
it's
the
procuring
officer
himself
who
undertakes
the
burden.
the
contractor
doesn't
have
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
contractors
go
to
the
officer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
want
to
add
anything
about
the
limits
of
the...
the
limits
of
the
remedial
efforts?
that
is,
i
think
there
are
decisions
of
this
court
that
would
say
a
legislature
could
take
race
into
account
in
trying
to
cure
past
segregation
in
schools,
for
example...
skip
it.
that's
all
right.
