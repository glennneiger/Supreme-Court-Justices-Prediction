do
we
know
that
that
was
the
reason
for
the
rejection?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pendley,
isn't
it
accurate
to
say
that
actual,
personal
harm
from
discrimination
is
necessary,
but
it
is
presumed?
i
mean,
there...
isn't
the
scheme
of
the
statute
that
technically
it
is
necessary,
but
it
is
simply
presumed
to
exist
if
the
enterprise
is
a
minority
enterprise?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
the
government
says
that
that's
good
enough.
if
you
have
a
problem
with
the
presumption,
you
could
have
come
in
and
showed
that
in
your
case,
in
the
case
of
this
contract,
the
presumption
was
not
valid.
did
you
have
such
an
opportunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
he
know
that
the
company
is
claiming
that
status?
is
it
posted
somewhere
publicly
that
he
would
know
whose
claim
to
challenge?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
determined
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
response
to
somebody's
challenge,
or
on
its
own
initiative?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
example
where
somebody
in
the
position
of
adarand
successfully
challenged,
brought...
an
individual
successfully
brought
a
challenge?
do
you
know
of
any?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
of
any.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
adarand
says
that
as
a
practical
matter
that's
a
fantasy,
that
there's
not
enough
time,
there's
not
enough
information,
and
besides
which
you
blackball
yourself
by
identifying
yourself
as
a
litigious
individual.
no
general
contractor
wants
to
hire
somebody
who's
going
to
promote
litigation,
and
if...
now,
is
that
true
or
false?
unless
you
can
show
me
some...
you
know,
the
fact
that
this
presumption
is
really
only
that,
and
that
it's
a
real,
live,
working
system
in
which
it's
challenged
with
some
regularity,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
in
effect
a
conclusive
presumption.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
days,
what
is
the
limit
of...
if
there
is
any,
of
the
government's
ability
to
use
race
as
a...
as
the
basis
for
a
presumption
in
some
of
its
programs?
suppose
the
government
has
a
very
important
space
program
which
just
can't
afford
any
mistakes,
and
it
says,
just
looking
over
education
statistics,
whites
generally
have
a
higher
level
of
education,
and
we
are
going
to
assume
that
any
bidder
that
is
white-owned
is
a
more
competent
bidder...
it's
just
a
presumption.
it
can
always
be
refuted
by
nonwhite
bidders...
and
we're
going
to
use
that
presumption
for
the
program.
is
that
okay?
a
very--
justice
antonin
scalia
--very
serious,
critical
need
for
perfection
in
this
program,
and
the
government
says,
we're
just
going
to
adopt
this
presumption.
of
course,
it's
rebuttable.
no
problem.
if
you
want
to
come
in
and
show
that
even
though
you're
not
white,
you're
very
smart
and
very
competent,
that's
okay,
but
you
can
come
in
and
show
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
it's
a
good,
valid
governmental
purpose
in
both
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can
do
that,
but
can
it
do
it
by
adopting
race-based
presumptions?
i
mean,
there's
no
question
that
it
can
do
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
it
can
act
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
discrimination,
but
can
it
do
it
by
simply
adopting
a
presumption
on
racial
lines?
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
made
the
determination
in
fullilove,
i
suppose,
that
10
percent
was
the
adequate
remedial
number.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case,
if
i
understand
the
scheme
correctly,
is
that
there
is
no
particular
number.
it's
up
to
the
contractor.
he
can
give
preferential
treatment
to
as
many
mbe's
as
he
wants,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
punishment
doesn't
fit
the
crime.
i
mean,
it's
really
up
to
the
individual
contractor.
justice
antonin
scalia
optional
if
you
want
to
forgo
the
$10,000--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
he
more
favored
if
he
adds
on
more
dbe's?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is,
minority-owned,
not
necessarily
disadvantaged.
i
mean,
this
inquiry
isn't
an
annual
inquiry
into
whether
they
have
in
fact
been
discriminated
against.
it's
just
an
inquiry
into
whether
they
are
minority-owned
year
by
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
mean?
does
it
mean
that
there's
an
inquiry
into
whether
they
suffered
discrimination
in
the
past?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
determination
made
when
they're
certified?
i
thought
they're
certified
so
long
as
they're
minority-owned
and
therefore
come
within
the
presumption?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
presumed
discrimination?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
days,
could
i
ask--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
going
to
ask
about
the
standing
issue,
which
we
haven't
talked
about
this
morning.
you
spent
a
bit
of
your
principal
brief
on
that
issue.
was
it
raised
in
opposition
to
the
petition?
i
looked
quickly
through
that,
and
i
didn't
see
that.
is
there
some
reason
why
the
government
didn't
raise
it
then?
i
mean,
i
hate
to
take
a
case
and
go
through
the
labor
of
reading
the
briefs
and
then
dismissing
it
because
of
no
standing,
when
that
issue
was
not
raised
at
the
outset,
when
it
should
have
been.
did
the
government
raise
it
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
off-hand
where
that
was?
i
didn't
find
it
in
there,
and
i
really
don't
like,
you
know,
jurisdictional
arguments
that
come
after
we've
taken
the
case.
it's
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
very
nice,
but
i
don't
read
the
record
when
i
decide
whether
to
vote
to
grant
a
petition
for
certiorari.
i
read
the
brief,
and
the
brief
in
opposition...
the
petition
and
the
brief
in
opposition,
and
i
didn't...
i
don't
recall
that
being
an
issue
at
the
time,
and
then
when
i
get
the
principal
briefs,
i
find
it
is
an
issue
and
we
may
have
a
case
here
in
which
we
can't
decide
the
question
that
we
thought
we
were
going
to
decide.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
have
no
problem
with
that?
