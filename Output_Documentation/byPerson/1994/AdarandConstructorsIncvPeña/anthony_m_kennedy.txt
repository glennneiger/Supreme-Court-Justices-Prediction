justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
had
he
issued
about
83
bids
over
a
period
of
some
9
years?
was
that
the
testimony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
those
83,
or,
i
guess
64
where
there
were
subcontractors,
had
your
client
bid
on
all
of
those?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
government
interest
here
were
to
remedy
the
past
effects
of
racial
discrimination.
could
the
government
pass
a
statute
to
accomplish
its
interest
without
using
race-conscious
measures?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
open
to
one
who
challenges
the
certification
to
show
that
the
individual
that
owns
the
certified
firm
has
not
him
or
herself
been
the
victim
of
societal
discrimination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
the
act,
at
least
it's
theoretically
possible
to
challenge
the
determination
that
this
person
has
not
in
fact
been
subject
to
racial
discrimination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
the
sba
regulations
i
take
it
that
they
look
at
the
net
worth
of
the
certified
contractor--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
they
exclude
from
the
net
worth
the
value
of
his
residence
and
the
value
of
his
business,
so
if
you
had
a
business
that's
worth
$4
million
and
a
house
that's
worth
$1
million,
you'd
have
a
net
worth
of
zero
under
the
regulations,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
part
of
your
argument
that
there
was
no
injury,
that
adarand
had
the
ability
to
challenge
the
standing
of
the
successful
subcontractor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he...
they
do
ask
for
prospective
relief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
your
argument
is
that
it's
always
available
to
adarand
to
challenge
disadvantaged
status
by
suing
minority
contractors,
which
i
take
it
you
think
promotes
racial
harmony.
