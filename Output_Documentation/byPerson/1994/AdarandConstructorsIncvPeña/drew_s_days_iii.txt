thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
subcontracting
compensation
clause
challenged
here
is
a
means
of
effectuating
a
national
policy
designed
by
congress
and
supported
by
presidents
of
both
parties
to
ensure
to
the
greatest
extent
possible
that
federal
procurement
programs
do
not
compound
the
continuing
effects
of
well-documented
discrimination
but,
rather,
serve
to
offset
their
consequences.
the
process
by
which
compensation
is
awarded
is
neither
overinclusive,
since
members
of
certain
designated
racial
and
ethnic
groups
were
not,
in
fact,
disadvantaged
or
ineligible
under
the
program,
nor
underinclusive,
since
some
individuals
who
are
not
members
of
those
designated
groups
may
qualify
as
socially
and
disadvantaged
persons
under
the
regulatory
scheme.
mr.

mr.
chief
justice,
congress
could
have
done
that,
but
i
think
what
the
record
reflects
here
is
a
review
by
congress
over
a
number
of
years,
looking
at
the
degree
to
which
federal
contracting
dollars
were
going
to
contractors
who
had
participated
in
some
way
or
reinforced
discrimination
against
members
of
certain
racially
and
economically
disadvantaged
groups
and
decided
that
this
was
the
appropriate
way
to
do
it.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
wouldn't
characterize
it
as
administrative
convenience.
it
was
simply
a
determination
that
if
the
results
that
congress
wanted
to
have
occur
were
to
occur,
they
would
have
to
be
done
in
this
way.
congress--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--congress
was,
i
think,
concerned
about
that,
but
was
aware
that
the
administrative
scheme
that
was
in
place
or
set
up
after
the
statute
was
amended
would
deal
with
those
particular
problems.
one
has
to
understand
that
the
small
business
act,
for
example,
was
in
existence
for
25
years
before
congress
decided
to
focus,
as
it
has
in
recent
years,
on
the
problems
of
members
of
certain
racial
and
ethnic
groups
that
were
socially
and
economically
disadvantaged,
so
there
was
some
experience
on
the
part
of
congress
with
the
way
in
which
federal
procurement
dollars
were
somehow
not
finding
their
way
to
people
who
were
the
victims
of
discrimination.
mr.
drew
s.

what
a
contractor,
a
subcontractor
would
do
in
a
situation
like
this
in
adarand's
case
is
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
contracting
officer
or,
if
it
were
appropriate,
to
the
sba,
the
fact
that
it
felt
that
a
company
that
claimed
to
be
a
disadvantaged
business
enterprise
was
not
a
disadvantaged
business
enterprise.
it
could
point
to,
for
example,
the
amount
of
contracts,
the
number
of
contracts
that
that
particular
company
had
won.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
under
the
sturaa
scheme
disadvantaged
business
enterprises
are
listed
by
the
states
so
that
they
can
participate
in
programs
that
the
state
enters
into
with
the
federal
government,
so
it
is
possible
for
one
to
look
down
that
list
and
identify
those
who
are
claiming
to
be
disadvantaged
business
enterprises.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
it
can
be
done
at
the
time
that
that
subcontractor
comes
forward.
for
example,
in
this
subcontracting
compensation
clause
situation,
in
the
adarand
situation,
once
mountain
gravel
decided
that
it
was
going
to
participate
in
the
scc
program
and
was
seeking
out
disadvantaged
business
enterprises
and
gonzales
was
identified
as
a
dbe
that
could
fulfill
its
needs,
at
that
point--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--one
of
the
ways
that
adarand
would
know,
in
fact,
is
that
gonzales
has
been
involved
in
a
number
of
contracts,
and
they're
generally
aware--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think
that
once
the
subcontract
is
let
to
gonzales,
adarand
can
come
in
and
say
gonzales
does
not
qualify
appropriately
as
a
dbe.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
i
am.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
for
example,
a
challenge
that
came
through
the
sba
process
in
the
autek
case,
where
a
native
american
firm
had
claimed
social
and
economic
disadvantaged
status,
and
it
was
determined
that
because
of
the
income
of
that
particular
company,
it
should
not
be
permitted
that
status
as
a
disadvantaged
business
enterprise.
there
are
also--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--this
was
determined
by
the
small
business
administration.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it's
not
clear
exactly
how
that
was
done,
but--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--it's
very
hard,
justice
scalia,
to
identify
that,
because--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
correct,
but
the
record
does
reflect
that
there
have
been
many
situations
where
that
has
happened.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
by
that
i
mean
that
there
have
been
challenges
to
the
certification
of
agencies
as
disadvantaged
business
enterprises.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
the
point,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--no,
i
don't
think
that
we
have
precisely
pinned
down,
but
the
point
is
that
the
sba
and
the
state
contracting
agencies
get
information
from
a
number
of
sources,
and
they
are
open
to
claims
from
any
source,
and
then
investigate
those
particular
situations.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
it
is
not,
justice
scalia.
i'd
like
to
point
the
court
to
an
amicus
brief
by
the
latin
american
management
association,
which
identifies
at
pages
24
to
26
a
number
of
reported
situations
where
challenges
have
been
made.
it's
not
clear
from
what
particular
source
those
challenges
came,
but
challenges
were
successfully
made
to
claims
that
certain
organizations
were
disadvantaged
business
enterprises.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
don't
know--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct,
and
as
i
indicated,
this
information
can
be
received
from
any
source.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
justice
kennedy,
but
that
i
think
is
done
in
a
practical
sense
through
challenging
economic
disadvantage.
in
other
words,
if
a
challenge
can
show
that
a
claimed
disadvantaged
business
enterprise
is
competing
at
the
same
level
as
companies
that
are
not
disadvantaged
in
any
of
the
traditional
terms,
or
traditional
senses,
then
that
can
be
a
basis
for
disqualification.
as
i
indicated,
in
the
autek
case
that
was
the
way
the
court
looked
at
the
situation.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
it's
not
correct
to
say
that
there
can
be
a
challenge
to
someone
who
says,
i
am
an
african
american,
that
they
in
fact
are
not
african
american.
the
real
focus
of
this
program
is
on
disadvantage,
and
so
the
inquiry
naturally
focuses
on
whatever
the
problems
this
particular
organization
has
had,
if
it's
overcome
those
disadvantages
and
is
competing
as
would
any
other
agency
or
company,
then
it
is
not
eligible
for
participation
in
the
disadvantaged
business
enterprise
program.
and
let
me
just
say
on
the
question
of
whether
there
have
been
challenges,
we
view
this
particular
lawsuit
as
a
facial
challenge.
it
is
challenging
not
the
specific
operation
of
these
schemes,
but
challenging
the
existence
of
the
rebuttable
presumption
under
this
scheme
that
was
set
up
by
congress.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
in
fact,
justice
ginsburg,
although
it
appears
that
under
8(a)
one
can
challenge
economic...
that
there's
a
presumption
of
social
disadvantage
but
not
of
equal
economic
disadvantage,
and
that
under
the
8(d)
program
there's
a
presumption
with
respect
to
both.
the
fact
is
that
the
analysis
under
both
regimes
is
that
there
can
be
an
open
challenge
to
the
nature
of
the
particular
company
as
to
whether
it's
economically
disadvantaged,
so
the
regimes
and
the
challenges
and
the
rebuttals
are
all
directed
at
determining
whether
this
particular
company
is
economically
disadvantaged,
although
it
might
satisfy
the
social
disadvantage
prong
of
the
particular
scheme.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
difference
between
this
situation
and
the
situation
that
you
posed
is
a
question
of
whether
congress
is
acting
for
remedial
purposes,
and
what
we
have
here
is--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--no,
but
what
i'm
talking
about
is
congress
either
explicitly
or
by
way
of
the
operation
of
a
statutory
scheme
is
attempting
to
remedy
the
effects
of
prior
racial
discrimination,
relying
upon
its
authority
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth,
or
other
provisions
of
the
civil
war
amendment.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
congress
can
make
the
rules--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--less
stringent?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
what
this
court
has
indicated
in
a
number
of
decisions
is
that
congress
possesses
a
unique
and
comprehensive
power
to
legislate
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
or
section
2
of
the
thirteenth,
or
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
to
remedy
the
effects
of
racial
discrimination,
or
denial
of
equal
protection,
but
particularly
where
racial
discrimination
is
concerned,
and
the
example
that
justice
scalia
gave
indicates
nothing
about
the
desire
of
congress
to
deal
with
discrimination
and
to
remedy
it.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
it
can.
i
think
that
the
question
came
up
about
the
role
of
fullilove,
but
in
the
fullilove
case,
the
public
works
employment
act
that
was
at
issue
there
in
effect
designated
certain
groups
as
being
entitled
to
the
10-percent
set-aside
with
no
expectation
that
there
would
be
the
type
of
rebuttable
presumption
and
searching
inquiry
that
this
scheme
at
issue
here
provides.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mm-hmm.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
suppose
that's
correct
in
one
sense,
justice
scalia,
but
one
has
to
understand
how
the
scc
works.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
that's
not
correct.
first
of
all,
it
is
an
optional
program,
as
has
already
been
pointed
out.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
10
percent.
if
one
subcontracts
above
10
percent,
then
one
can
get
the
benefit
of
the
scc,
but
it's
not
an
open-ended
program.
in
other
words,
the
prime
contractor
cannot
continue
to
gain
more
and
more
money
by
taking
on
more
dbe
subcontractors
in
that
particular
contract,
because
the
compensation
is
limited
to
1.5
percent
of
the
overall
contract,
or
2
percent,
if
there
are
more
than...
two
or
more
subcontractors,
but
there's
not
an
infinite
ability
of
a
prime
contractor
to
just
add
on
dbe's
in
order
to
gain
compensation.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
he
is
not.
there's
no
indication
that
a
prime
contractor,
mountain
gravel
in
this
case,
would
have
lost
a
contract
because
it
didn't
take
advantage
of
the
scc.
it's
purely
optional,
and
therefore
mountain
gravel
could
have
decided
not
to
use
the
scc
at
all,
and
would
have
kept
the
prime
contract
and
would
have
carried
it
out
in
ways
other
than
under
the
dbe
program.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
the
regulations
require
that
there
be
an
annual
review
with
respect
to
dbe
certification.
it's
also
the
case
that
the
small
business
administration
under
its
program
conducts
annual
reviews
of
those
businesses
that
have
been
admitted
into
the
program.
what
we
have
here,
justice
stevens,
in
fact
is
a
continuing
review
by
congress
and
the
agency
with
respect
to
this
program.
under--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
i
think
what
the
review
is
supposed
to
do
is
identify
on
an
annual
basis
the
extent
to
which
those
who
have
been
certified
as
dbe's
are,
in
fact,
dbe's.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
not
correct.
it's
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
they
continue
to
warrant
the
benefits
under
this
program
as
disadvantaged
business
enterprises,
so,
for
example--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--no,
that's
a
determination
that's
made
when
they
are
certified,
but
after
they're
certified--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that
is
not
correct.
the
way
that
the
states
go
about
the
certification
process
is
to
look
not
only
at
whether
a
company
is
in
fact
presumed
to
be
economically
and
socially
disadvantaged
under
the
presumption,
but
also
whether
it
continues
to
be
economically
disadvantaged.
that
is,
has
it
continued
to
suffer
the
effects
of
discrimination
from
year-to-year.
so
if
there
is
a
company...
there
may
be
a
situation--
mr.

--it's
true
with
respect
to

it
could
be
decertified
because
it's
no
longer
a
small
business,
or
it
could
be
decertified
because
it
had
reached
a
level
of
economic
take-off
that
would
not
justify
its
receiving
whatever
benefits
were
available
under
the
program.
mr.

on

of

it
addresses
the
question
of
how
there
must
be
a
filing
annually
by
dbe's
and
if
there's
credible
evidence
coming
to
the
attention
of
the

it
may
trigger

the

that.

mr.

i
don't
understand
that
to
be
correct,
justice
kennedy,
but
in
any
event,
the
analysis
is
with
respect
to
whether
the
business
is
competing
in
a
way
that
would
justify
its
being
discharged
from
the
program
or
whether
it's
competing
in
a
way
that
reflects
that
it's
continuing
to
suffer

consequences--

the
discrimination
that

justice

there
are
various
ways
in
which
a
business
can
exit
from

type
of

there's
voluntary
withdrawal,
there's
an
expiration
of

program

actually

by

we

of
whether
there's
traceability,
or
redressability
with
respect
to
this
particular
situation.
there's
no
showing
that
adarand
lost
this
contract
because
of
the
rebuttable
presumption.
even
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
gonzales
was
a
disadvantaged
business
enterprise,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
indicates
that
gonzales
was
not,
in
fact,
socially
and
economically
disadvantaged,
and
therefore...
and
there's
no
showing
here
that
adarand
was
socially...
or
economically
disadvantaged,
and
therefore--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--it
is
true--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--no,
that's
not
the
suggestion.
our
point
is
that
under
this
court's
precedents,
lujan
and
lyons,
for
example,
this
court
has
imposed
very
severe
restrictions
on
the
extent
to
which
a
person
in
an
individual
lawsuit
can
seek
prospective,
injunctive,
or
declaratory
relief.
this
is
a
situation--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--no,
that
would
not
be
possible.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
right,
and
to
challenge
the
extent
to
which
the
contracting
officer
had
not,
in
fact,
done
that
and
had
allowed
a
dbe
that
was,
in
fact,
not
economically
and
socially
disadvantaged
to
benefit
from
the
operation
of
the
subcontracting
compensation
clause.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
