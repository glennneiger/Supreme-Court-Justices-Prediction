spectators

the

we'll

mr.
feirson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
really
haven't
borrowed
very
often
from
the
national
labor
relations
act,
have
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
pursuant
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
under
the
nlra?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
act,
you
mean
the
nlra.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
to
facilitate
collective
bargaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
depends,
too,
on
what
level
of
generality
you're
talking
about.
you
could
go
back
to
the
findings
in
1935
and
say
the
end
is
labor
peace,
but
that
doesn't
really
help
you
much
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
what
they're
going
to
get
is
basically
consensual,
whereas
here
what
you
get
is
by
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
feirson.
mr.
gold,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
feirson,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feirson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
case
which
i
have
to
announce
is
consolidated
case
number
94-834,
north
star
steel
company
v
charles
thomas.
this
case
and
no
case
that
is
consolidated
would
come
to
us
on
a
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
respondents
brought
claims
in
the
federal
district
court
in
pennsylvania,
claiming
that
the
petitioners,
who
were
their
employers,
had
laid
off
employees
without
giving
the
60-day
notice
required
by
the
worker
adjustment
and
retraining
notification
act
known
as
warn.
warn
does
not
provide
a
statute
of
limitations.
petitioner
has
moved
for
summary
judgment
arguing
that
the
court
should
borrow
the
six
month
statute
of
limitations
from
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
their
respondentâ€™s
action
could
be
barred
by
such
a
limitation
period.
the
third
circuit
consolidated
two
appeals
and
held
that
this
statute
of
limitations
for
warn
should
be
borrowed
from
state
law.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
souter
and
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today
and
i
should
say
incidentally
that
the
opinion
in
wyoming
v.
nebraska
was
also
authored
by
justice
souter,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
state
law
is
the
proper
source
of
the
statute
of
limitations
for
the
warn
act.
the
presumption
that
state
law
should
provide
the
limitation
periods
for
federal
statute
they
do
not
provide
their
own,
is
long
standing
and
settle.
only
when
state
limitations
period
would
frustrate,
the
objectives
of
the
cause
of
the
action
at
issue
have
we
departed
from
that
rule
and
here
because
several
analogous
state
statute
provide
limitations
period
that
would
not
frustrate
the
state
policy,
beside
the
point
that
a
federal
analogue
also
exists.
in
this
case
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
