mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
touching
briefly
on
two
observations
which
have
been
alluded
to
in
the
earlier
portions
of
the
argument
but
that
i
think
are
especially
crucial
to
the
disposition
of
this
case,
and
the
first
is
that
in
determining
whether
the
nlra
and
the
warn
act
are
analogous
for
purposes
of
limitations
borrowing,
the
question
is
not
whether
the
similarities
between
the
statutes
outnumber
the
dissimilarities,
but
as
mr.
gold
has
mentioned,
the
question
is
whether
the
statutes
are
similar
with
respect
to
those
features
which
would
be
especially
relevant
to
the
choice
of
an
appropriate
limitations
period.
and
then
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
allude
to
is
one
that
justice
ginsburg
mentioned.
that
is,
it's
not
simply
coincidence
or
a
fluke
in
this
case
that
the
actions
filed
would
be
timely
under
all
of
the
statutes
of
limitations
proposed
except
for
that
afforded
by
the
nlra.
statutes
on
the
order
of
2
to
3
to
4
years
are
far
more
typical
with
respect
to
the
filing
of
civil
actions
than
is
the
6-month
period
established
by
section
10(b),
and
i
think
that
should
lead
the
court
to
conclude
that
there
were
some
fairly
unusual
factors
at
work
that
led
congress
to
adopt
the
10(b)
limitations
period,
and
the
question
is
whether
those
factors
are
present
in
warn
act
suits
as
well.
and
i
think
the
two
crucial
factors
are
first,
as
mr.
gold
mentioned,
section
10(b),
the
nlra
generally
is
particularly
concerned
not
with
labor
law
in
general,
but
with
the
process
of
collective
bargaining
and
private
dispute
resolution
under
the
terms
of
a
cba,
and
i
think
the
contrast
between
delcostello
and
reed
is
telling.
this
court
borrowed
the
nlra,
the
section
10(b)
limitations
period
when
it
was
dealing
with
a
case
that
implicated
private
dispute
resolution
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
reed
it
was
dealing
with
the
general
field
of
labor
law.
it
was
even
dealing
with
an
area
in
which
some
of
the
primary
conduct
prohibited
by
title
i
was
also
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
nlra,
but
the
court
said
in
reed
that
because
the
case
did
not
touch
upon
the
formation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
or
the
private
resolution
of
disputes
thereunder,
borrowing
of
the
10(b)
limitations
period
was
inappropriate.
i
think
the
second
point
that's
crucial
in
determining
why
6
months
is
appropriate
in
the
nlra
context
is
that
the
filing
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
requires
simply
the
filing
of
a
charge
with
an
administrative
body.
the
nlrb
then
takes
responsibility
for
determining
whether
a
complaint
should
be
filed,
and
for
prosecuting
a
complaint
if
one
is
pursued,
and
by
contrast,
a
situation
in
which
the
responsibility
is
entirely
upon
the
private
litigant
to
file
suit
in
federal
district
court,
the
choice
of
such
a
short
limitations
period
is
less
appropriate.
we
recognize
from
delcostello
that
we
can't
make
the
argument
that
borrowing
a
limitations
period
established
for
a
limitations
charge
is
never
appropriate
for
filing
a
suit
in
court,
because
delcostello
held
that
sometimes
it
was,
but
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
body
of
federal
employment
statutes
generally,
we
see
a
pretty
clear
pattern.
those
statutes
like
the
nlra,
title
vii,
the
adea,
which
require
a
litigant
to
proceed
by
filing
an
administrative
charge,
typically
contain
periods
for
doing
so
on
the
order
of
3
to
6
months.
statutes,
by
contrast,
such
as
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
portal-to-portal
pay
act,
which
require
a
litigant
to
proceed
by
filing
a
suit
in
court,
typically
contain
a
limitations
period
on
the
order
of
2
to
3
years,
and
i
think
this
body
of
law
reflects
a
congressional
judgment
that
typically
a
litigant
should
have
more
time
when
the
responsibility
is
entirely
upon
him
to
pursue
his
claim
by
means
of
filing
a
judicial
action.
the
final
thing
i'd
just
like
to
touch
upon,
as
mr.
gold
said,
is
that
we
think
that
the
court's
presumption
of
sate
law
borrowing
has
worked
well.
we
think
that
borrowing
state
law
in
this
context
would
not
create
problems
of
disuniformity
and
unpredictability
that
are
so
extreme
as
to
outweigh
the
presumption,
but
if
the
court
was
particularly
concerned
with
uniformity,
we
think
that
there
are
better
ways
of
accomplishing
that
than
by
borrowing
the
nlra
statute
of
limitation,
such
as
borrowing
the
limitations
period
in
the
portal-to-portal
pay
act,
or
establishing
a
generic
characterization
of
warn
act
claims
that
would
apply
in
all
states.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i...
with
respect,
i
don't
think
it
would...
that
the
proper
disposition
for
this
court
would
be
to
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
ask
them
to
pick
a
statute.
that
is,
for
the
sake
of
predictability
the
court
obviously
doesn't
grant
cert
in
a
large
number
of
cases,
and
when
it
does
so,
it
typically
wants
to
establish
rules
that
will
guide
a
lot
of
lower
courts,
so
it
might
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
pick
the
proper
rule.
but
if
this
court
decides
that
it
doesn't
want
to
do
that,
then
i
think
the
proper
disposition
would
simply
be
to
say
that
suit
would
be
timely
under
any
of
the
plausible
limitations
periods,
and
leave
it
at
that.
i
don't
see
a
value
that
would
be
served
if
this
court
didn't
make
the
choice,
but
asked
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
so.
