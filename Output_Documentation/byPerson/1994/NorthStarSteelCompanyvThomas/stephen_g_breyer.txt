but
is
there...
that's
what
i
wonder.
i
mean,
isn't
there
another
reason
for
state
law,
that
it's
sort
of
like
the
civil
code?
i
mean,
states
tend
to
have
categories
of
things.
they
have
sort
of...
statute
of
limitations
apply
to
dozens
of
statutes
like
the
civil
code
does,
and
they're
in
the
business
of
trying
to
categorize
is
this
more
like
a
tort,
is
this
more
like
a
contract,
is
it
the
civil
code
or
the
penal
code
or
which
code.
well,
the
federal
government
just
isn't
like
that,
and
so
initially
you'd
have
a
much
harder
time
if
you
throw
every
statute
of
limitations
up
for
grabs.
rather,
we
look
to
the
civil
code...
we
look
to
the
state
originally,
you
see,
because
that
was
their
business,
applying
statutes
of
limitations
from
the
state
to
federal
and
state
causes
of
action.
