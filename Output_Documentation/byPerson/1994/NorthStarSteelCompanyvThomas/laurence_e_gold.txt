mr.
laurence
e.
gold
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
could
begin
with
delcostello,
it
seems
to
me
helpful
to
do
so.
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
delcostello
was
not
simply
a
situation
dealing
with
abstractions.
the
choice
that
was
seen
there
in
determining
how
to
deal
with
those
hybrid
suit
challenges
to
arbitration
awards
or
grievance
settlements
was
somewhere
between
20
days,
3
months,
6
months,
and
9
months,
and
the
court
was
very
concerned
in
reaching
its
eventual
conclusion
to
look
at
the
range
of
choices
that
were
suggested
as
clear
analogies
in
both
the
state
and
federal
level.
here,
we're
dealing
with
a
mandatory
wage
standard
or
labor
standard
statute
that
generates
a
quite
straightforward
damage
action
for
failures
to
act,
and
only
a
straightforward
court
damage
action.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the
statute
is
quite
clear
in
giving
the
union
standing,
associational
standing
to
seek
such
liability,
and
that
is
the
basis.
we
believe
that
congress
in
this
kind
of
situation
plainly
has
the
constitutional
authority
to
provide
such
associational
standing.
i
have
a
dual
obligation,
however.
i'm
also
here
on
behalf
of
the
north
star
plaintiffs
who
were
unrepresented,
and
obviously
in
that
case
you
have
an
action
by
a
group
of
individuals,
each
of
whom
plainly
has
standing
to
pursue
the
remedy
that
is
provided,
the
monetary
remedy
provided
to
them.
i
would
emphasize,
i
know
that
it
is
not
waivable,
that
the
standing
issue
is
not
one
that
to
this
point
has
been
pursued.
it
may
well
be
the
subject
of
a
petition
some
day.
in
terms
of
the
kind
of
situation
we
have
here,
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
important
to
note
two
things.
one,
while
the
petitioners
go
back
and
forth,
there
is
a
norm,
a
federal
rule,
and
the
norm
is
that
state
statutes
are
borrowed
unless
that
would
frustrate
federal
policy
or
is
at
odds
with
the
purpose
or
operation
of
the
federal
law.
and
secondly,
that
as
i've
indicated,
this
kind
of
cause
of
action
for
failure
to
provide
wages,
to
provide
employment,
payment
for
employment
or
employment
forgone,
is
a
quite
straightforward
claim
of
the
kind
that
the
law
has
dealt
with
and
that
state
law
deals
with
normally
by
a
range
of
statute
of
limitations
which
balance
the
needs
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
interests
of
the
law
and
the
needs
of
the
defendant
in
an
area
of
2
to
4
or
5
years.
that's
what
the
gamut
of
state
statutes
that
were
suggested
here
would
provide.
so
far
as
we
are
aware,
and
so
far
as
the
petitioners
have
shown,
a
state
law
with
a
6-month
statute
of
limitation
for
this
kind
of
employee
claim
is
all
but
unheard
of.
secondly,
we
believe
that
the
law
in
this
court
is
far
more
stable
than
the
petitioners
have
suggested.
their
argument
in
our
view
is
really
a
one-case
argument.
it's
agency
holding
corp.
v.
malley-duff,
the
rico
case.
aside
from
that,
this
court
has
two
lines
of
authority,
one,
state
law
applies,
two,
with
regard
to
implied
or
common
law
causes
of
action
that
come
out
of
or
are
brigaded
with
a
federal
statute
which
has
an
express
statute
of
limitation,
the
federal
law
provides
the
rule.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
your
honor--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
we
noted
at
the
end
of
our
brief
as
a
final
argument
that
if
there
was
a
federal
law
borrowing
rule,
if
you
looked
at
all
possible
analogies,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
portal-to-portal
act
are
very,
very
close
analogies
indeed.
i
think
that
the
problem
is
that
the
petitioners
are
awfully
cavalier
about
the
unsettling
effect
of
such
a
change
on
the
decided
cases.
except
if
you're
going
to
go
back
to
a
regime
of
prospective
overruling,
the
cases,
the
1983
cases,
the
other
cases
would
have
to
be
revisited
if
you
were
to
change
from
a
state
law
presumption
with
these
narrow
exceptions
to
a
federal
borrowing
regime
in
general.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
if
that
could
be
done,
i
am
not
here
to
argue
for
the
overall
virtue
of
state
borrowing.
if
we
were
at
square
1,
our
only
interest
is
that
the
search
for
the
balance
of
interest
and
policies
looks
to
the
balance
of
interest
that
goes
into
statutes
of
limitation,
not,
as
petitioners
would
have
it,
looking
for
a
norm
somewhere,
anywhere,
that
looks
like
this
norm
without
regard
to
what
kind
of
enforcement
system
or
what
the
purposes
and
policies
behind
the
norm
would
be.
so
i
could
not
argue
to
you
that
the
state
law
presumption
or
basic
borrowing
rule
is
of
the
essence
to
federal
jurisprudence.
i
would
only
argue
that
it
is...
it
has
been
established
by
this
court
as
the
norm.
it
is
read
into
federal
statutes
as
the
intent
of
congress
except
in
narrow
circumstances,
and
it
produces
rational
statutes
of
limitations
in
this
context
whereas
the
suggestion
of
nlra
borrowing
does
not.
beyond
that,
i
can
only
say,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
that
we're
dealing
with
a
wasting
resource
here.
starting
for
any
statute
after
1990
there
is
now
a
residual
federal
rule,
and
against
that
background
the
question
of
revising
the
basic
standard
and
unsettling
those
matters
which
have
been
settled,
some
of
which
drive
a
great
deal
of
litigation
like
1981
and
1983,
may
be
a
higher
cost
than
is
warranted
in
this
case,
where
the
state
statutes
really
are
very
close
to
the
most
analogous
federal
statute,
which
is
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
right,
and
i
do
think
that
when
we
have
the
discussion
of
the
kind
we
do
here
about
forum
shopping
and
complexities,
lawyers
and
clients
should
read
the
law
books
and
do
know
the
basic
statute
of
limitations,
and
it
is
the
rare
case,
one
hopes,
that
these
nice
questions
of
perfect
characterization
come
up.
that
doesn't
mean
this
court
can
avoid
those
nice
questions,
but
the
essential
point
is
precisely
the
one
you've
made,
justice
ginsburg.
from
our
perspective,
when
you
look
at
this
kind
of
claim,
we
ought
to
be
found
to
have
brought
this
warn
act
case
timely
in
just
over
a
year,
no
matter
whether
it's
a
state
borrowing
rule
or
a
federal
borrowing
rule.
the
nlra
analogy
just
doesn't
fit
because
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
reed,
and
it
would
seem
to
us
that
it's
difficult
to
come
up
with
two
cases
that
are
closer
in
terms
of
a
conceptual
question
of
when
you
go
to
nlra
borrowing
than
this
case
and
reed,
the
fact
that
there
is
an
overlap
between
the
nlra
norm
and
another
federal
statutory
norm
is
not
decisive.
that
isn't
what
this
court
means
when
it
talks
about
looking
to
the
policies
and
purposes
of
the
statute.
8(b)(1)a
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
covers
a
far
greater
fraction
of
landrum
griffin
title
i
101
cases
than
the
nlra
provisions
cover
with
regard
to
warn,
and
reed
quite
rightly
says
that
that
isn't
the
test,
the
test
is
the
policies
that
are
peculiarly
relevant
to
determining
the
proper
statute
of
limitations.
the
nlra
statute,
as
this
court
explained
in
delcostello
and
again
in
reed,
is
a
statute
of
limitation
that
has
to
do
with
protecting
the
formation
and
operation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
private
settlement
through
grievance
arbitration,
and
to
furthering
stable
ongoing
bargaining
relationships.
it's
not
easy
for
me
to
face
up
to
this
in
argument,
but
somewhere
between
75
percent
and
85
percent
of
the
people
covered
by
the
warn
act
are
not
governed
by
any
collective
bargaining
relationship.
the
purpose
of
the
warn
act
is
to
give
those
people
not
a
chance
to
work
out
a
private
settlement,
as
justice
kennedy
has
already
pointed
out,
but
an
opportunity
to
adjust
and
retrain
by
having
sufficient
notice,
and
we
haven't
even
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
warn
act
generates
a
notice
to
the
affected
community,
which
is
so
far
removed
from
any
conception
of
the
nlra
as
to
have
lost
all
touch
with
it.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
albeit
in
the
preemption
context,
but
equally
to
the
point
here,
that
they're
two
very
different
classes
of
labor
legislation,
labor
standards
legislation
which
redounds
to
the
benefit
of
all
employees
and
sets
norms
that
are
nonwaivable,
and
are
the
product
of
the
rules
of
the
state,
and
the
collective
bargaining
system,
which
aims
to
add
a
layer
of
protection
and
to
forster
a
private
resolution
system.
the
warn
act,
like
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
like
the
portal-to-portal
act
which
is
referred
to
in
the
legislative
history
here,
is
a
labor
standards
statute
which
generates
the
kind
of
court
litigation
which
has
always
been...
for
damages,
which
has
always
been
covered
in
the
range
of
situations
by
statutes
of
limitation
of
2
to
4
years,
not
the
kind
of
statute
of
limitation
in
the
nlra
which
has
a
particular
private
agreement,
private
resolution
system
in
mind.
thank
you.
