if
we
focus
on
those
employees,
the
ones
who
aren't
organized,
there's
a
concern
that
might
not
be
present
if
we
were
thinking
of
the
union,
so
lay
delcostello
to
one
side.
this
is
a
very
short
limitation
period.
if
we
look
at
the
nlra,
it's
6
months
to
file
a
charge,
right,
which
is
an
administrative
charge,
rather
easier
than
filing
a
court
complaint.
think
of
unorganized
employees,
the
ones
you
were
saying
could
go
alone,
and
the
necessity
of
coming
into
a
court
with
a
federal
complaint
in
6
months,
isn't
that
extraordinarily
short?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
all
tied
into,
it's
in
the
midst
of
bargaining.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
here
you
can't
make
that
claim
to
the
same
extent.
you
certainly
can't
make
it
for
the
people
who
are
not
represented
by
the
union.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
pennsylvania
law,
suppose
it's
a
disciplinary
layoff.
we
had
a
case
like
that
last
year.
the
employer
says,
you
go...
for
10
days
you're
suspended,
and
the
employee
then
wins
that
case,
wouldn't
there
be
a
claim
under
the
guarantee,
the
wage
state
law
to
say
that
my
wages...
at
least
there
are
some
state
laws,
we
had
one
last
year,
that
covered
precisely
that
situation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
would?
is
there
no
state
law
remedy
if...
this
is
a
wrongful
layoff
for
discipline.
is
there
no
state
law
claim
that
such
an
employee
would
have?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
there
would
be
no
claim,
you
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
could
be
a
claim
under...
some
state
laws
would
protect
workers,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
would
be
a
case
where
on
your
theory,
you're
not
getting
paid
for
wages
that
you
earned
by
being
on
the
premises
and
doing
the
job,
and
still
would
come
under
a
state
statute
that
provides
for--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
i
understand
correctly
the
law
that
if
we
say
your
argument
is
plausible,
and
then
you
say
the
analogy
to
the
state
guaranteed
wage
payment
law
or
to
the
fair
labor
standards,
those
are
also
plausible,
but
for
you
to
win
you
have
to
show
that
your
analogy
is
not
just
as
close,
and
not
just
closer,
but
clearly
closer,
significantly
more
appropriate.
so
if
we're
in
equipoise
in
that,
or
even
if
we
find
a
preponderance,
you
lose.
you
have
to
come
up
with
the
equivalent
to
clear
and
convincing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
but
one
of
your
arguments,
ultimate
arguments
is
maybe
we
shouldn't
have
that
presumption.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
shouldn't
the
very
change
in
1990
make
us
cautious
to...
for
this...
from
now
on
there's
this
default
provision,
and
it's
long.
it's
4
years.
so
shouldn't
that
make
us
very
cautious
about
reaching
back
for
the
time
before
we
had
that
and
change
what
that
regime
was?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
settled
expectation
would
be
what
our
case
law
was,
clearly
close
and
significantly
more
appropriate.
we
would
be
unsettling
that
expectation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
we
say,
what's
essential
to
your
position
in
this
case
is
that
we
reject
the
6-month
nlra
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
the
rest,
it's
in
one
sense
academic,
because
you'd
meet
any
other
conceivable
limitation
period,
whether
federal
or
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you've
had
your
administrative
toils,
and
you've
had
at
least
some
guidance
about
what
to
do.
you
haven't...
you're
just
not
out
there
alone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
do
that
you
have
to
go
first
to
the
eeoc.
here,
the
employee
on
your
version
would
have
to
go
directly
into
federal
court,
not
having
gotten
any
guidance,
any
counseling,
any
aid
from
any
administrative
agency.
