well,
but
i
mean,
every
federal
statute
you
should
look
to
federal
law
if
that's
the
criterion.
i
mean,
it's
always
obviously
better
to
have
one
federal
law
for
a
federal
cause
of
action,
but
we've
never
done
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
one
of
the
criterion.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
a
federal
statute
that
applies
nationwide?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
criterion
that
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
doesn't
do
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
factor
in
deciding
whether
this
particular
federal
statute
has
some
special
reason
for
picking
a
federal
statute
of
limitation.
every
federal
statute
has
that
reason,
so
you
know,
the
factors
you
should
pick
should
be
distinctive,
and
that
is
never
distinctive.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be
a
closer
analogy,
but
not
because
it's
national.
