justice
david
h.
souter
i
suppose
you're
going
to
get
to
this
at
some
point,
but
will
you
comment
specifically
on
why
the
nlra
is
a
better
source,
is
subject
to
a
better
analogy
than
the
pennsylvania
statute
for
payment
of
back
wages
due?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
and
some
cases
are
easy
and
some
are
not.
i
mean,
the
contingencies
upon
which
the
obligation
may
arise
can
be
very
difficult
to
untangle.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
the
ease
in
some
cases
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
is
a
good
reason
to
assume
ease
in
all.
let
me
go
back
to
another
aspect
of
the
analogy.
one
thing
the
nlra
does
not
do
is
to
provide
that
if
you
fail
to
warn,
you've
got
to
pay
60
days'
wages,
and
what
we're
dealing
with
is
the
case
in
which
the
policy
of
the
act
in
fact
is
not
realized,
the
warning
is
not
given,
and
at
that
point
it
seems
to
me
the
employee
is
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
employee
who
has
not
gotten
paid
for
the
last
60
days
that
he
worked.
he's
owed
60
days'
wages,
and
why
for
that
reason
isn't
the
analogy
with
the
wage
claim
statute,
and
i
will
say
a
state
wage
claim
statute,
the
strongest
analogy?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
he's...
the
nlra
doesn't
have
any
formula
to
the
effect
that
if
you
fail,
it's
equal...
the
failure
is
equal
to
60
days'
wages.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
depending
on
the
agreement.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
the
thought
is
cruder
than
that.
maybe
the
thought
is,
we've
been
saying
this
long
enough,
so
congress
may
simply
be
assumed
to
assume
that
we
will
follow
the
rule
that
we
look
for
the
analogy,
and
if
the
analogy
is
there,
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
and
a
moment
ago
you
were
avoiding
the
analogy
by
referring
to
it
as
back
pay.
another
way
of
characterizing
it
is
simply
to
say,
under
warn
you've
got
to
go
on
paying
for
60
days
after
you
give
the
notice,
and
if
you
give
notice
in
time,
you're
going
to
get
60
days
of
work
out
of
that.
if
you
don't
give
notice
in
time,
you
may
not
get
the
60
days
of
work,
but
you've
still
got
to
give
60
days
of
pay,
so
instead
of
being
a
back
pay
kind
of
statute,
what
it
is,
is
in
effect
a
guarantee
of
work
or
payment
in
the
absence
of
work,
and
so
it's
not
like
a
back
pay
statute,
it's
like
a
statute
guaranteeing
the
payment
of
wages,
e.g.,
the
pennsylvania
wage
collection
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
they're
not
earned
in
this
case,
it's
because
the
employer
does
not
give
the
notice,
so
that
if
in
fact
the
employer
says,
well,
this
case
does
not
cry
out
for
the
same
treatment,
it
is
only
because
the
employer
has
violated
the
statute,
and
that's
why
it
doesn't
cry
out
for
the
same
treatment.
indeed,
it
cries
out
for
at
least
as
equitable
a
treatment.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
those
60
days
of
wages
are
60
days
that...
that
penalty
is
in
lieu
of
wages
which
the
employer
could
have
paid
in
response
for
labor,
if
the
employer
had
given
notice
at
the
time
the
statute
says
he's
supposed
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
am
i
factually
wrong
on
that?
maybe
i
am.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me...
may
i
ask
it
this
way?
if
the
employer
gives
notice
60
days
before
closing,
the
plant
functions
for
the
60
days,
and
closes.
the
employer
pays
the
wages
for
the
people
who
worked
during
that
period,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
warn
has
nothing
more
to
say.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
employer
doesn't
give
the
notice
until
30
days
before
the
closing,
the
act
says
to
the
employer,
you
have
got
to
behave
by
paying
wages
just
as
if
you
had
given
notice
at
the
proper
time,
which
means
you've
got
to
pay
another
60
days
of
wages,
i.e.,
30
of
those
for
wages
actually
earned,
and
30
for
not
earned,
but
it's...
isn't
it
therefore...
if
that's
the
way
the
statute
functions,
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
this
statute
creates
a
wage
claim
in
order
to
enforce
the
notice
requirement?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
characterization.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
a
fair
characterization?
justice
david
h.
souter
thank
you,
mr.--
--mr.
stewart,
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
assuming
we
agree
with
you,
should
we
leave
the
judgment
below
in
its
present
state,
or
should
we
send
it
back
to
the
court
and
say,
pick
a
particular
statute?
shouldn't...
it's
true,
this
case
is
going
to
be...
this
case
on
that
assumption
would
be
upheld
no
matter
which
of
the
pennsylvania
statutes
might
apply,
but
shouldn't...
for
the
future,
shouldn't
there
be
a
clear
rule
down
in
the
federal
courts
there?
