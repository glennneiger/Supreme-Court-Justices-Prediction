mr.
steven
b.
feirson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
is
once
again
confronted
with
the
task
of
having
to
borrow
a
statute
of
limitations
to
fill
in
in
another
federal
statute
for
the
situation
where
the
congress
has
failed
to
provide
a
limitations
period.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
statute
is
the
worker
adjustment
and
retraining
notification
act,
or
warn.
in
creating
warn,
the
congress
took
a
right
which
already
existed
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
for
unionized
employees...
that
is,
the
right
to
advance
notice
of
impending
plant
closings
or
mass
lay-offs,
first
standardized
the
notice
period
to
60
days,
and
then
extended
that
right
of
notice
to
nonunionized
employees.
the
ultimate
goal
behind
both
the
notice
provision
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
warn
is
to
provide
employees
with
the
opportunity
to
do
something
to
lessen
the
adverse
effects
brought
upon
them
by
this
severe
economic
dislocation.
the
fact
that
warn
follows
the
nlra
model
has
resulted
in
the
regulations
which
have
been
drafted
to
govern
warn
coming
to
a
substantial
extent
from
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
has
also
resulted
in
numerous
court
decisions
which
look
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
try
to
fill
in
the
interstices
of
warn.
this
court
in
the
past
has
counseled
that
in
these
type
of
borrowing
situations,
while
there
is
generally
a
presumption
in
favor
of
state
law
borrowing,
when
a
federal
source
clearly
provides
a
closer
analogy
and
where
the
federal
policies
at
stake
and
litigation
practicalities
make
that
federal
source
a
significantly
more
appropriate
vehicle,
then
the
borrowing
ought
to
come
from
the
federal
source.
in
this
particular
instance,
with
respect
to
the
warn
act,
we
believe
that
you
have
a
national
labor
relations
act
which
is
by
far
a
closer
analogy
than
any
which
exists
at
state
law,
and
we
also
believe
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
both
furthers
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
warn
act,
that
particular
statute
of
limitations,
and
also
would
tend
to
avoid
the
kind
of
forum
shopping
and
collateral
litigation
which
would
be
inevitable
if
state
law
borrowing
goes
along
with
the
warn
act.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
no.
this
court
did
borrow
from
the
national
labor
relations
act,
for
example,
in
1983
in
delcostello.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
but
it
has...
this
court,
until
fairly
recently,
simply
didn't
borrow
very
often
from
any
federal
statute
until
the
last
10
or
12
years.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
yes.
the
fact
that
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
one
of
the
things
that's
going
on
is
a
balancing
of
interests...
that
is,
the
interest
of
employees
in
getting
notice,
and
then
ultimately
in
seeking
some
type
of
benefit
to
aid
them
in
the
event
of
a
plant
closing
and
a
mass
layoff,
and
what
the
warn
act
is
attempting
to
do
is
almost
precisely
the
same.
i
mean,
ultimately
there
are
differences,
to
be
sure,
but
ultimately
the
purpose
behind
both
is
to
give
employees
notice
so
they
can
do
something
to
help
protect
themselves
against
the
loss
of
their
job.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
both
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
under
the
warn
act
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
goal
is
being
pursued,
which
is
not
simply
a
collective
bargaining
goal
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
mean,
yes
there
is
a
value
in
having
the
employer
talk
to
employee
organizations,
but
there
is
an
end
in
mind,
and
the
end
in
mind
is
to
provide
the
opportunity
to
ameliorate
the
effects
of
a
plant
closing
or
a
layoff,
which
is
precisely
what
warn
is
doing.
the
flsa
does
nothing
more
than
say,
the
law
says
that
when
you
work
overtime
you
get
paid
time-and-a-half,
and
guess
what,
if
your
employer
doesn't
pay
you
time-and-a-half,
you
have
a
right
to
get
the
money
that
you
earned.
it
has
very
little
to
do
with
this
notice
notion,
and
the
use
of
the
notice
to
somehow
try
to
buffer
the
economic
harm
that's
going
to
occur
to
employees
when
they
lose
their
job.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
well,
i
believe
the
court
ought
to
look
at
all
those
acts.
again,
though,
the
right...
there
is
a
right
that
currently
exists
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
is
almost
identical
to
the
right
which
warn
gave
to
nonunion
employees,
which
is
a
right
to
get
notice
of
a
plant
closing,
to
prevent
an
employer
from
simply
saying
on
monday
morning
the
plant
is
closed,
so
long.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
no.
it's
pursuant
to...
it
arises
from
the
act
itself.
the
act
has
been
interpreted
to
require
effects
bargaining.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
excuse
me,
the
nlra
requires
effects
bargaining.
the
nlra
requires
the
union
and
the
employer
to
get
together
and
to
negotiate
about
the
impact
on
employees
when
a
plant
closes,
for
example.
in
order
to
have
effective
effects
bargaining,
there
has
to
be
notice
of
the
plant
closing.
i
mean,
if
the
employer
comes
in,
in
my
example,
on
monday
and
says
the
plant's
closed,
it
minimizes
the
ability
to
have
effective
bargaining,
so
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
for
unionized
employees
there
is
this
notice
right.
there
is
this
right
to
learn
about
the
plant
closing
before
it
happens.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
but
to
facilitate
collective
bargaining
to
what
end.
ultimately,
the
hope
is,
although
not
necessarily
the
expectation,
the
hope
is
that
that
collective
bargaining
process
will
result
in
something
happening
which
will
benefit
the
employees
who
are
going
to
suffer
from
the
economic
dislocation.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
no,
but
in
an
effects
bargaining
situation,
what's
crystal
clear
is
that
when
the
union
sits
down
with
the
management,
what
the
union
is
seeking
is
some
type
of
aid
for
the
employees
that
are
going
to
lose
their
jobs:
severance
pay,
retraining,
perhaps
some
type
of
concession
to
keep
the
plant
open...
i
mean,
it's
a
very
focused
inquiry.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
no.
what
we
would
maintain
is
what
you
get
here
is
consensual,
too.
the
notice
goes
out
under
warn,
and
the
employees,
if
they're
represented
by
a
union,
through
their
union
representative,
if
they're
not
represented
by
a
union,
themselves
individually
or
collectively,
because
they
have...
the
nonrepresented
workers,
the
nonunion
workers
have
section
7
rights.
they
have
a
right
to
act
collectively.
they
may
elect
a
representative,
they
may
go
in
a
group,
and
what
they
attempt
to
do
at
that
point...
and
the
whole
purpose
of
warn
is
to
start
to
take
action
to
protect
themselves.
one
thing
they
can
do
is
approach
the
employer
and
try
to
get
some
type
of
consensual
understanding
from
the
employer.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
so.
this
court
in
delcostello
held
that
the
6-month
period
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
applied
to
actions
where
an
employee
is
suing
his
or
her
union
and
the
employer
arising
out
of
the
alleged
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
on
the
part
of
the
union
and
the
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
that
particular
situation,
it
seems
to
me
that's
even
a
more
daunting
prospect
for
an
individual
employee.
he
doesn't
have
the
benefit
of
masses
of
people,
his
coemployees
who
are
being
laid
off,
he
doesn't
have
the
benefit,
perhaps,
if
he's
a
nonunion
employee
and
has
union
employees
next
to
him,
of
the
benefit
of
the
union
doing
something.
he's
taken
on
the
employer
and
the
union,
and
this
court
has
held
in
that
particular
circumstance
6
months
is
enough
time.
similarly--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--well--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--well,
the
filing
of
a
301
action
in
court,
while
it
clearly
has
an
impact
later
on
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
because
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
interpreted
through
a
301
action,
it
doesn't
have
a
direct
impact
on
the
ongoing
collective
bargaining
process.
i
mean,
there's
a
suit
by
an
employee
who
says,
i
don't
like
the
way
my
union
represented
me
with
respect
to
my
rights
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
it's
different.
not
only
that,
there
is
experience
now
under
the
warn
act,
and
there
have
been...
there
has
been
a
substantial
amount
of
litigation
filed
within
the
6-month
period.
in--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--i--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--well,
first
of
all,
justice
souter,
you
are
entitled,
an
employee
would
be
entitled
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
back
pay
in
that
situation,
so
in
other
words,
if
you
have
two
identical--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--it
is--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--no,
but
it
can
be
greater.
it
can
be
greater
or
it
can
be
lesser,
depending
on
how
many
days--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--well,
no,
depending
on
how
many
days'
wages
were
actually
lost.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
but
the
concept
is
that
in
both
the
nlra
situation
and
in
the
warn
act
situation,
back
pay
for
a
failure
to
give
notice
is
a
remedy.
the
problem
with
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
that
this
whole
notion
of
trying
to
find
an
analogy,
as
difficult
as
that
notion
is,
and
it
is
a
difficult
notion,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
premised
on
the
concept
that
you
want
to
find
an
analogous
statute
because
if
you
find
an
analogous
statute
there
is
some
thought
that
the
congress
may
have
balanced
the
same
sorts
of
interests.
i
mean,
that...
otherwise
it
makes
no
sense
to
look
for
an
analogy.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
but
we
have
to
define
what
we
mean
by
analogy,
and--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--in
the
pennsylvania
wage
collection
act,
those
wages
are
earned.
people
work.
the
wage
payment
and
collection--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--it's
not...
with
all
due
respect,
it's
not
necessarily
linked
to
whether
folks
work
or
don't
work.
for
example,
the
plant's
going
to
close
on
september
1st
no
matter
what.
if
you
give
notice
60
days
before
september
1st,
you
don't
owe
anything.
if
you
don't,
if
you
give
30
days,
then
you
owe
30
days.
the
time
people
work
and
the
time
they
actually
earn
money
is
not
dependent
on
the
notice.
the
60-day
back
pay
remedy
is
a
damage
remedy,
not
for
wages
that
have
been
earned,
but
which
are
not
paid.
they
are
damages
flowing
from
a
violation
of
the
act.
that
is
that
the
employer
didn't
do
what
the
employer
should
have
done.
that
is
a
base--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--it
is
not--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--no.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
no...
well,
i
think...
i
don't
know
if
it's
factually
wrong.
i
think
it's
conceptually
not
correct
in
that
what
it
is
is
a
damage,
is
a
liquidated
damage
remedy
for
failure
to
give
notice.
it's
not
in
lieu
of
wages
which
have
been
earned
or
which
would
have
been
earned
had
notice
been
given.
the
congress
came
up
with
a
liquidated
damage
provision.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
this
may
just
be
dancing
on
the
head
of
a
semantical--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--and
that's--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--no,
and
my
answer
to
that
would
be
no,
because
as
soon
as
you
say
it's
in
lieu
of
wages,
which
is
what
you
just
said,
as
soon
as
you
conceptualize
that
30
days'
damages
is
in
lieu
of
wages,
that
means
it's
not
earned.
that
means
it's
not
like...
at
its
core
it
is
not
like
the
wage
payment
and
collection
law.
warn
is
a
notice
statute.
the
flsa
and
the
pennsylvania
wage
and
collection
law...
i
hope
it's
nothing
i
said.
[laughter]
i
knew
i
wasn't
doing
especially
well,
but--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--thank
you
very
much.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
so
that,
it
is
a
difference
between
a
statute
which
says
workers
are
entitled
to
get
the
money
they
actually
earn
by
their
labors
versus
a
statute,
a
notice
statute
which
says
to
an
employer,
if
you
don't
give
notice
you
have
to
pay
damages,
and
we're
going
to
calculate
those
damages
because
we
don't
want
a
very
long
drawn-out
process.
that's
one
of
the
elements
of
the
warn
act.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
the
pennsylvania
law
would
not
cover
that
situation,
would
not
give
the
employee
wages
for
that
period
of
suspension.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
let's
assume
for
a
moment
that
it's
not
a
union
employee
with
a
just
cause
clause
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
because
if
it
was
a
union
employee
with
such
a
clause,
they
could
file
a
grievance
and
they
could
get
paid
for
that.
let's
assume
a
nonunion
employee,
pennsylvania's
is
an
employee...
an
employment-at-will
state,
and
in
that
particular
setting,
the...
what
the
court
would
say
is
that
the
employee
had
no
right
to
continue
to
be
employed--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--there
would
be
no
claim.
there
would
be
no
claim.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
yes.
my
understanding
is
that
there
are
certain
state
laws
for
payment
of
wages
which
include
sort
of
these
wrongful,
either
discharge
or
wrongful
suspension
notions,
but
they're
relatively
rare.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
but
again,
conceptually
that
would
be
a
damage
provision.
it
might
come
within
the
statute,
but
it's
different.
the
basis
of
the
pennsylvania
wage
payment
and
collection
law
and
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
putting
the
penalty
provisions
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
one
side
for
a
moment,
is
the
employees
have
earned
this
money.
they've
worked
for
it
and
they
haven't
been
paid
it,
and
so
these
statutes
give
the
employees
the
right
to
get
the
money
they
have
actually
earned
by
virtue
of
their
labors,
and
that
is
different
from
the
warn
act,
which
is
a
notice
statute.
the
reason
why
the
national
labor
relations
act
at
least
seems
to
us
to
be
much
more
analogous
is
it
has
as
an
overlay...
admittedly
it's
a
fairly
narrow
band,
but
it
has
as
an
overlay
this
notice
right,
and
when...
if
the
court
goes
to
look
for
an
analogy,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
analogy
the
court
ought
to
be
looking
for
is
a
notice
statute,
because
it
is--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--as
long
as
this
court
continues
to
adhere
to
the
presumption
that
state
law
borrowing
ought
to
be
favored,
that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
it
doesn't...
i
don't
think
in
this
particular
case
the
court
need
reach
that
far,
but
i
don't
think
in
light
of
what's
happened
over
the
last
10
or
12
years
it
makes
a
whole
lot
of
sense
any
more,
frankly.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
it
is
in
part
because
of
that,
it
is
in
part
because
the
enunciated
basis
underlying
the
presumption
is
that
congress
looks
at
what
this
court
does,
and
in
the
past
when
congress
looked
at
what
this
court
did
it
saw
that
it
always
borrowed
from
the
state,
and
so
when
congress
didn't
put
a
statute
of
limitations
into
a
federal
statute,
you
should
assume
that
the
congress
assumed
there
would
be
state
law
borrowing.
given
what's
happened
in
the
last
12
years,
not
only
the
decisions
in
this
court
in
delcostello
and
agency
holdings
and
lampf,
but
also
the
fact
that
in
1990
congress
itself
decided
that
it
didn't
much
like
state
law
borrowing,
at
least
prospectively,
to
sit
here
today
and
say,
geez,
there's
a
lot
of
vitality
to
this
state
law
borrowing
rule,
seems
wrong.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
the
legislative
history
behind
the
1990
enactment
suggests
that
the
reason
why
the
congress
didn't
make
that
retroactive
was
because
it
didn't
wish
to
upset
settled
expectations
with
respect
to
statutes
of
limitations.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
no,
i...
my
reading
of
what
the
legislative
history
suggests
is
that
when
they
talked
about
settled
expectations,
they
were
talking
about
the
fact
that
for
numerous
federal
statutes
over
the
years
there
had
become
settled
expectations
as
to
what
the
statute
of
limitations
ought
to
be,
and
to
apply
the
1990
act
retroactively
would
be
to
say,
for
example
in
the
lempt
case
in
theory
you
have
1
in
3
years.
and
people
are
now
out
there
and
have
been
for,
that's
a
relatively
short
period,
for
3
or
4
years
operating
on
a
1
and
3-year
assumption
if...
of
course,
it
was
passed
in
'90
so
this
is
not
a
good
analogy,
but
you
wouldn't
want
to
go
back
and
undo
that,
because
there
are
settled
expectations
about
what
the
statute
should
be,
and
so
that's
the
reason
they
didn't
make
it
retroactive.
that's
not
to
say
that
because
they
didn't
make
it
retroactive
that
doesn't
mean
that
congress
didn't
understand
that
we'd
continue
along
on
this
borrowing
course,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
to
suggest
that
congress
was
aware
of
what
the
tests
were
that
had
been
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
decisions
prior
to
1990.
in
fact,
there's
a...
i
don't
think
you
can
call
it
more
than
a
snippet
of
legislative
history,
but
there
is
a
snippet
of
legislative
history
in
one
of
the
house
reports
which
says
that
the
congress
recognizes
that
from
that
point
forward
the
borrowing
was
going
to
be
done
on
the
basis
of
whichever
state
or
federal
statute
was
most
analogous.
it
doesn't
seem
to
incorporate
any
type
of
presumption
in
favor
of
state
law
borrowing.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
the
problem,
of
course,
is
in
many
federal
statutes
like
this
one
there
are
no
real
analogues
at
the
state
level.
this
is
sort
of
unknown
at
common
law.
it's
not
the
sort
of
thing...
i
think
there
now
may
be
four
or
five
state
closing
laws,
which
means
there
are
45
states
that
don't
have
them.
there's
not
a
lot
of
experience
in
dealing
with
these
multi-state
types
of
statutes
as
compared
to
what
the
state
normally
does,
which
deals
with
causes
of
action
which
fall
within
the
boundaries
of
the
particular
state
and--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--well,
that...
i
would
not
argue
that
this
court
has
said
that
is
the
sole
criterion;
but
this
court
has
said
in
articulating
its
test
that--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--yes.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
no.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
no,
but
what
i
was
suggesting
is--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--is
that
one
of
the
criteria
is
a
desire
for
uniformity
to
avoid
forum
shopping
and
collateral
litigation,
and
that
is
true
that
whenever
you
adopt
from
a
federal
statute,
that
takes
care
of
that
particular
problem,
but
that's
one
factor,
but
it
is
a
factor,
and
it
is
a
factor
which
would
exist
each
time
you
borrowed
from--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--no,
but
that
is
a
factor
which
follows
upon
trying
to
pick
the
closest
analogy,
and
if
you
find
that
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
a
far
closer
analogy
than
anything
available
at
state
law,
then
you
look
at
the
other
factors,
and
that
would,
indeed,
weigh
in
favor
of
adopting
it.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
it
was
closer
because
it
was
national.
what
i
meant
to
suggest
was
uniformity
creates
a
uniform
standard
across
the
nation
and
thus
minimizes
the
forum
shopping
aspect.
to
the
extent
that
i
have
time
left,
i'd
like
to
reserve
it.
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
quickly,
i
think
it's
important
first
to
note
that
when
we
talk
about
a
6-month
statute
with
respect
to
the
warn
act,
frequently
it's
going
to
be
a
lot
more
than
6
months.
it's
only
6
months
if
there's
an
absolute
permanent
plant
closing.
otherwise,
in
the
more
complicated
situations
that
have
been
referred
to...
for
example,
mass
layoff
situations...
there
has
to
be
a
6-month
period
of
employment
loss
before
the
right
accrues,
so
that
in
essence
an
employee
may
have
as
much
as
a
year
before
they
have
to
file
suit.
that's
number
1.
with
respect
to
title
vii
being
an
administrative
agency
and
having
6
months
to
file
and
you
don't
have
to
bring
a
lawsuit,
you
do
have
to
bring
a
lawsuit
within
90
days
of
receiving
your
right-to-sue
letter
from
the
eeoc,
so
that
within
the
employment
laws
there
are
a
lot
of
short
limitations
periods.
and
finally--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--sometimes
you
are
out
there
alone
if
it's
the
equal
employment
opportunity--
mr.
steven
b.
feirson
--but
if...
in
both
situations,
whether
you
go
to
the
administrative
agency
or
you
go
to
a
lawyer
to
file
suit,
the
critical...
it
seems
to
me
the
critical
issue
in
a
statute
of
limitations
context
is
when
is
it
that
you
know
you
have
the
right,
and
in
both
situations
you
have
to
know
you
have
the
right
within
6
months.
thank
you.
