but
the
notice
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
to
invoke
the
board's
procedure
so
that
it
can
preserve
the
bargaining
context
over
the
short
period
of
time
when
collective
bargaining
agreements
often
exist.
it
seems
to
me
that's
quite
inapplicable
to
a
money
judgment,
to
a
money
claim
for
an
employee.
true,
the
employee
needs
it
as
fast
as
he
or
she
can
get
it
for
retraining,
et
cetera,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
much
more,
frankly,
like
the
fair
labor
standards
act
cause
of
action
under
federal
law.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
analogy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
may
have
jumped
ahead.
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
if
we
agree
that
a
federal
statute
should
apply,
that
we
should
make
the
determination
of
which
statute
at
this
level
rather
than
remanding,
but
the
analysis
does
seem
to
be
tangled
at
almost
every
juncture.
i
suppose
we
look
in
part
to
how
close
the
analogy
is
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
deciding
whether
to
take
the
state
or
federal
law,
but
if
we
do
that,
then
i
think
we
probably
also
should
look
at
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
in
part
because
we
now
have
many
more
federal
statutes
from
which
to
borrow?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
gold
suppose
that
the
pennsylvania,
or
a
state
statute
in
a
case
involving
warn
is
really,
we
think,
on
all
fours
with,
say,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
statute,
the
statutes
serve
precisely
the
same
function,
have
almost
the
same
types
of
provisions.
just
suppose
that.
would
there
be
any
reason
in
that
case
for
us
to
say
that
we
would
borrow
the
federal
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
our
existing
jurisprudence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
fact
that
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
parallels,
say,
most
of
the
state
statutes
from
which
we
would
borrow
would
not
be,
say,
special
exception
for
escaping
from
our
presumption?
