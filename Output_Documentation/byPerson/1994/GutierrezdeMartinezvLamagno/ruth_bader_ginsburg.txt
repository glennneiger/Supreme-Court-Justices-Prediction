justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
against
him
as
an
individual?
i
guess
the
united
states
i
can
understand
that
argument,
but
suing
him
as
an
individual...
you
can't
sue
the
united
states--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
the
united
states
either.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
say
the
diplomatic
immunity
is
so
total
that
even
acting
outside
the
scope
of
employment,
it
would...
there
is
no
remedy
in...
in
colombia?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you
sued
him
personally
based
on
all-purpose
jurisdiction,
you
sued
him
where
he
resided,
his
all-purpose
forum
where
he
resided?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
you
would
be
left
without
a
remedy,
but
isn't
there
some
kind
of
administrative
proceeding
ongoing
before
the
dea?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
the
plaintiff
seek
judicial
review?
i
mean
ordinarily
it's
more
desirable
to
have
the
united
states
than
the
employee
as
the
defendant,
so
the...
when...
but
when
there's
an
exception,
as
there
is
here.
otherwise,
the
certification
is
more
likely
than
not
to
please
the
plaintiff,
is
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
even
if
he
assaulted...
if
the
u.s.
employee
assaulted
the
plaintiff,
if
the
united
states
certified
that
this
was
within
the
scope
of
employment,
your
argument
is
thus
unreviewable,
and
that's
an
exception
to
the
tort
claims
act
because
it's
intentional
conduct...
intentional
tort...
there
is
no
remedy
against
anybody?
i
think
that's...
that's
your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
and
it
isn't
either/or...
either
the
united
states
is
liable...
if
so,
it's
exclusively
liable,
and
the
exceptions
apply;
or
if
the
united
states...
if
it's
outside
the
scope
of
the
employment,
then
the
employee
may
be
liable,
but
it
can't
be
both?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
once
the
united
states
is
substituted,
even
if
it's
determined
that
it
comes
within
an
exception
to
the
tort
claims
act,
why
isn't
it
just
like
you
have
an
ordinary
diversity
suit,
and
the
defendant,
two
days
after
the
complaint
is
filed,
moves
to
the
same
state
as
plaintiff,
so
you
have
no
more
diversity?
it
doesn't...
doesn't
wreck
federal
jurisdiction,
does
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
you...
then
you
have
federal
courts
trying
a
case
between
two
people
of
the
same
citizenship.
why
is
that
any
different
from
the
united
states
having
been
the
real
party,
and
then
the
united
states
dropping
out
because
the...
the
exception
applies,
but
the
court
finds
in...
was...
was
outside
the
scope
of
the
employment,
so
the
employee
gets
substituted?
why
is...
why
should
that
be
different?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
diversity
has
in
fact
ended.
here
there's
a
federal...
there's
the
suit
against
the
united
states...
certainly
a
secure
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction,
a
suit
against
the
united
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
once
existed,
just
as
diversity
once
existed
in
my
other
case,
so
once
federal
jurisdiction
having
latched
on,
the
court
can
continue
to
hear
the
case,
even
if
the
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
terminates
after
the
proceeding
begins?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
this
case,
to
be
the
judge
of
her
own
case.
that's
what
it
comes
down
to
ultimately,
does...
doesn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
here
if
there
is
a
certification,
everybody
is
off
the
hook.
the
employee
is
off
the
hook
and
the
united
states
is
off
the
hook.
so
you're
letting
an
executive
official
make
the
determination
that
no
one
is
liable
to
this
private
party
who
is
allegedly
injured
as
a
result
of
the
conduct
of
a
government
agent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
the
attorney
general
being
judge
in
her
cause,
in
that
sense,
is
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
of
the
government?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no...
there
was
no
issue
about
the
certification.
no
question
was
raised
about
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nobody
said
that
he
acted
outside
the
scope
of
his
employment,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
the
standards...
you
said...
you
just
used
the
words,
set
up
standards
for
how
the
determination
is
made.
as
i
understand
it,
the
u.s.
attorneys
all
over
make
these
certifications
or
not.
are
there
guidelines
for
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
don't
even
know
if
there's
any
uniformity
in
the
way
these
certifications
are
being
handed
out,
do
we?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
united
states
"shall
be
substituted"...
so
why
isn't
it
a
case
against
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
is
gutierrez
v.
lamagno
number
94-167.
this
is
a
case
that
presents
a
who
decides
question
an
executive
officer
definitely
or
a
court
on
judicial
review.
the
case
stems
from
a
car
accident
in
columbia,
south
america.
the
petitioners
are
citizens
of
columbia
who
were
injured
in
the
accident.
they
thought
to
recover
for
their
injuries
from
the
driver
whose
negligence
allegedly
caused
the
accident.
the
driver
is
a
federal
employee
now
back
in
virginia.
so,
the
petitioners
sued
him
in
a
federal
district
court
in
that
state.
special
rules
govern
personal
injury
suits
against
federal
employees.
if
the
attorney
general
certifies
that
the
employee
was
on
the
job
at
the
time
of
the
mishap,
the
united
states
replaces
the
employee
as
the
defendant.
usually
plaintiffs
don’t
resist
the
substitution
of
the
united
states
as
the
party
defendant
because
the
government
is
able
to
pay
an
eventual
judgment,
and
the
employee
may
be
less
well
healed,
but
in
rare
cases
the
united
states
is
immune
from
suit
while
the
employee
is
not,
and
in
those
cases,
the
plaintiff
will
want
the
employee
to
remain
as
the
defendant.
this
is
such
a
case.
the
united
states
is
not
suable
for
accidents
occurring
abroad.
so,
the
person
injured
in
columbia
would
have
no
case
unless
they
could
perceive
against
the
driver,
the
federal
employee.
the
key
question
in
instances
like
this
one
is
whether
the
employee
was
on
the
job
or
off
duty
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
if
the
driver
was
on
the
job,
the
united
states
must
be
substituted,
and
the
case
must
be
dismissed.
if
the
driver
was
not
on
the
job,
the
driver
and
not
the
united
states
is
the
proper
defendant
and
the
case
can
continue
in
court.
the
issue
we
resolve
is
who
decides
the
key
question
whether
the
driver
was
on
or
off
the
job.
the
attorney
general
certified
that
the
driver
was
on
the
job.
does
she
have
the
–
not
only
the
first,
but
also
the
final
word
on
that
subject
or
is
her
certification
subject
to
judicial
review.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
thought
the
attorney
general
certification
was
unreviewable
in
court
and
that
meant
the
case
had
to
be
dismissed.
we
reverse
that
that
disposition.
courts
ordinarily
assume
that
congress
intended
actions
of
executive
officials
to
be
subject
to
judicial
review
and
we
adhere
to
that
assumption
here.
the
assumption
is
one
the
attorney
general
has
self
urges
and
for
good
reason.
how
impartiality
as
solo
judge
in
a
case
like
this
one
is
rendered
doubtful
for
if
she
certifies
there
will
be
no
liability
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
or
on
the
part
of
the
employee,
no
litigation
cost,
no
judgment
to
pay.
so,
she
has
every
incentive
to
certify
rather
than
to
review
certification.
because
we
conclude
that
the
attorney
general’s
certification
is
subject
to
judicial
review,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
scalia
and
thomas
joined.
