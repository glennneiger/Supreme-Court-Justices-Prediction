mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
for
the
court
today
is
to
resolve
the
dispute
between
the
circuits.
that
is,
whether
or
not
the
attorney
general's
scope
of
employment
certification
issued
under
the
westfall
act
is
subject
to
de
novo
judicial
review
by
the
district
court.
this
action
involves
a
simple
automobile
accident
in
barranquilla,
colombia,
where
an
employee
of
the
federal
government,
driving
at
night,
injured
petitioners.
an
administrative
claim
was
filed
in
'91.
subsequently,
after
two
years
of
filing
additional
data
to
the
administrative
body,
told
the
statute
of
limitations
of
the
action
was
filed
in
'93.
three
months
subsequent
to
that,
the
attorney...
the
u.s.
attorney
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
issued
a
one-line
paragraph
saying
that
mr.
lamagno
was
in
fact
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
we
opposed
that
motion
in
the
district
court,
however,
based
on
the
fourth
circuit's
ruling
in
johnson
v.
carter,
that
held
that
there
was
no
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
but
to
dismiss
the
action
and
substitute
the
united
states.
as
a
result
of
being...
having
the
united
states
substitute,
the
action
was
dismissed
as
a
result
of
the
foreign
claims
exemption
to
the
federal
torts
claims
act.
and
this
action
was
then
filed...
a
petition
before
this
court.
we
hold
that...
we
believe
that
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
is
in
error
in
two
essential
ways.
first,
there
is
nothing
within
the
westfall
act
to
indicate
that
the...
that
the
presumption
of
judicial
review
under
the
federal
drivers
act,
which
was
the
underpinning
of
the
westfall
act,
was
amended.
that
at
all
times
judicial
review
was
maintained--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--yes.
under
(d)(1),
mr.
chief
justice,
they
changed
the
statutory
language
to
expand
what
was
under
the
federal
drivers
act...
that
is
immunity
from
suit
if
a
federal
driver
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment
at
the
time
of
the
car
accident...
to
encompass
all
federal
employees
as
long
as
they
were
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
employment.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
it
said
nothing,
with
the
exception
on
the
issue
of
removal
from
the
state
court
to
the
federal
court,
which
permitted
a
challenge
by
the
individual.
with
regard
to
a...
an
action
that
was
filed
in
divers,
in
the
federal
court.
it
was
moot.
there
was...
there
was
a
presumption
of
judicial
review,
and
the
courts
followed
that
presumption.
and
that--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--i...
i...
in
reviewing
the
decision--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--specifically,
no...
within
the
drivers--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--the
federal
drivers
act.
it
was
not
specifically
black-letter
law
within
the
statute.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
no,
your
honor.
subsequently,
the
westfall
act
expanded
the...
the
ability
of
immunity
from
suit
on
an
individual
basis
if
the
federal
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment.
the
reason
why
the...
the
need
for
judicial
review
is
threefold.
first,
without
judicial
review,
there
is
a
question
about
due
process.
here
we
have
individuals
who
have
a
right
of
action
as
a
result
of
a
tort
action,
having
property
damage
and
injuries,
having
no
opportunity
to
be
heard
as
a
result
of
a...
a...
a
certification...
scope
of
employment
by
an
administrative
body,
who
is
acting
both
as
a
factfinder
and,
at
the
same
time,
as
defense
of
the
federal
employee.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
correct.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
no,
your
honor.
as
a
result
of
sovereign
immunity,
mr.
lamagno
was
detailed
to
the
united
states
embassy,
and
so
there
is
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
in
colombia.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
correct.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
well,
you
could
not
under
colombian
civil
law
sue
him
as
an
individual
as
a
result
of
his
being
in
the
service
of
a
foreign
embassy.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
correct.
so
he
has...
in
that
capacity,
there
is
not,
within
civil
law...
the
civil
code
of
colombia,
a
scope
of
employment
exception
to
this
diplomatic
immunity.
and
so,
we're...
we're
essentially
without
recourse
under
the
laws
of
colombia.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
correct.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
it
occurred
in...
in
january
of
'91.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
correct.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
well,
because
essentially,
even
under
the
federal
drivers
act
you
had
a
right
to
challenge
the
issue
of
the
scope
of
employment
to
determine
whether
in
fact
at
the
time--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--that
is...
that
is
the
issue
before
this
court...
whether
in
fact
it
was
changed.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
before
the
accident
occurs?
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
based
on
that
hypothetical--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--well,
it...
no,
based
on
that
hypothetical.
however,
that...
those
facts--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--i
think...
i
think
there's
a
large
distinction
between
the
hypothetical
you
presented
and
the
facts
with
regard
to
the
westfall
act
and
the
antecedent
federal
drivers
act.
the
westfall
act
was
never
designed
and
never
attempted
to
remove
the
issue
of
judicial
review.
this...
there
is
cursory
legislative
language
in
the
history
of
it.
but
with
regard
to
the
specific--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--if
it
did--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--on
your
hypothetical--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--no.
based
on
your
hypothetical,
i
said
that
that
would
be
acceptable,
because
there
would
be
a
clear,
emphatic
statement
on
the
part
of
congress,
saying
that...
that
for
these
specific
findings
and
these
specific
fact
situations,
we
will
deny
and
we
will
underwrite
all
federal
employees.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
now,
whether
or
not
that
was
challenged
subsequent--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--leaving
both
issues...
both
the
factfinding
and
the
defending
of
the...
of
the...
of
the
employee.
and
then,
the
third
issue,
removing
all
recourses
for
the
injured
parties.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
but
that
is
the
issue.
our
challenge
is
whether
or
not
mr.
lamagno
was
in
fact
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
and
what
we
requested
both
at
the
administrative
level...
where
we
raised
the
challenge
initially...
was
some
sort
of
impartial
factfinding
that...
to
assure
that
in
fact
he
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment
to
provide
that
type
of
immunity.
neither
at
the
administratively
level
nor
at
the
judicial
level
do
we
have
that
type
of
impartial
factfinding.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
we
had
this
lawsuit
against
the
individual.
that...
that
is...
that
is
a
common
law
tort
that
occurred
in...
in
colombia,
which
we
have
sued
mr.
lamagno
in
his
individual
capacity.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
there
would
be
no
way
of
getting
into
the
court
because
of
the
diplomatic
immunity.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
because...
because
he
is
a
resident
of
virginia.
he
is
a...
he
works
out
of
the...
the
agency
that
is
stationed
in
virginia.
all
indices
indicates
that
this
is
where
his
connection
was,
was
in
virginia.
hence,
that's
why
the
lawsuit...
why
otherwise--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--we
served
process
both
on...
on
the
agency
head
and
also
on...
on
the
agency
in
his
name,
which
was
accepted.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
well,
they...
we
never
received
it
back
to
our
process
server,
your
honor.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
yes.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
theoretically
there
is
an
administrative
process.
but
if
the...
if
lamagno's
grandchildren
get
to
a
certain
age,
i'm
certain
that
they
will
be
able
to
deal
with
that,
because
here
we
are
four
years
down
the
road,
a
simple
car
accident,
and
dea
has
the...
has
not
responded
in
any
fashion
other
than...
i
should
say...
dea...
the
torts
division
of
the
justice
department,
because
it
was
transferred
from
dea
to
the
torts
division.
although
they
have
requested
mountains
of
documentation,
both
medical
reports
and
other...
other
information,
they
never
have
responded
during
this
four-year
course
as
to
what
the
status
of
this
action
would
be.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
well,
the...
the...
the
line
of
reason
from
this
court
starts
out
that
there
is
a
property
right
in
a
common
law
action.
that's
been
supported
in
petrousky
v.
united
states
in
the
second
circuit,
and
reaffirmed
there.
and
that,
once
you
have
that
property
right,
in
order
to
deprive
them
of
the
property
right,
you
have
to
have
due
process.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
okay,
one
moment,
your
honor.
according
to
petrousky,
they
cite
paul
v.
davis,
424
u.s.
693.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
but--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--but
that's
only
if
you
abide
by
the
analysis
that
when
the
westfall
act
was
passed,
it
was
designed
to
remove
judicial
review.
there
is
nothing
to
support
that...
that
assertion.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
i
believe
that...
that
you'd
have
the
same
sort
of...
of
problem
of
having
the
factfinder--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--yes.
yes,
i...
i
would
find
the
same
problem--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--the
issue
of
bias
by
the
factfinder
is
one
of
the
key
ingredients
of...
of...
of
this
particular
case.
because
here
you
have
the
person
who
is
the
supervisor
of
the
employee,
if
you
will,
making
the
decision
that
when
he
makes
the
decision
that
in
fact
scope
of
employment
exists,
it
ends
all
litigation.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
no,
they
are
colombian
citizens.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
in
barranquilla,
colombia.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
they're...
they're--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--it's
sad
to
say,
no.
but
in
this
instance,
when
they
have
an
action
against
an
employee
who
lives
in...
in
the
united
states,
and
they're
filing
under
state
law
right
of...
a
tort
action
under
the
state
law
of
virginia,
and
then
if
there
is
affirmative
government
action
to
deprive
them
of
the
right
to
litigate,
due
process
does
kick
in.
they
have
a
right
to
litigate
in
virginia.
but
for
the
fact
that
he
was
a
federal
employee,
they
would
have
had
this
issue
resolved
three
or
four
years
ago.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
no.
if...
if...
if
i,
as
a
tourist,
am
in
france
and
i
crash
into
someone's
car,
and
i
go
back
and...
and
the
people
in
france
come
over
to
virginia--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--to
ensure
that
he
has
due
process
within
the
judicial
system
to
have
his
case
litigated.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
we're
not...
we're
not
extending
the
due
process
clause
to
france.
what
we're
saying
is
that
once
the
person
comes
in
and
seeks
access
to
the...
the
u.s.
courts,
he
has
the
same
rights
as
any
u.s.
citizen
to
those...
to
the--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--i...
i
have
none,
your
honor.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
not
in
my
brief.
but
i--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--it
is
a
statutory
case,
your
honor.
i
backed
into
that
somewhat
unwanting
here.
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
it
was
suggested--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--it
was
suggested
in
my
brief
in
the
sense
that
it
follows
the
petrousky
argument
in
the...
that...
that
the
westfall
act
assured
that
there
would
be
judicial
review
and
that--
mr.
isidoro
rodriguez
--correct,
your
honor.
if
there's
no
more
questions,
i'll
reserve
time.
thank
you.
