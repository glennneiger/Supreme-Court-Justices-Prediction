with
diplomatic
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rodriguez,
did
you
make
this
constitutional
argument
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
surprised
you
spent
all
the
time
on
a
constitutional
argument.
i
thought
this
was
a
statutory
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
also
true,
isn't
it,
that
the
statute
does
provide
that
the
defendant
can
get
protected
from
you
by
appealing
an
adverse...
a
refusal
to
certify?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
correct
that
in
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical
you
would
have
the
case
removed,
and
then
you
would
file
an
answer
denying
your
liability?
i
mean
you...
you
defend
on
the
merits
that...
that
the
united
states
would
then
be
the
defendant...
in
her
hypothetical
she
gave,
where
you
said
he
was
in
the
scope
of
his
employment,
but
there
was
no
accident.
you'd
get
removal
and
substitution,
and
then
you'd
defend
on
the
merits,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
the
provision
you
quote
earlier?
i
had
thought
that
provision
would
cover
case
where
it
was
even
perfectly
clear
that
the
defendant
was
acting
in
the
scope
of
his
employment,
but
nevertheless,
the
united
states
would
have
a
defense
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
that
the
individual
would
not
have...
such
as
willful,
more
compounded,
and
things
like
that.
because
even...
even
if
he's
in
the
scope
of
his
employment,
there
would
be
cases
that
would
be
subject
to
remand
under
this
provision,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
when
the
united
states
cannot
be
held
accountable,
then
the
individual
remains
accountable,
even
though
he
was
acting
in
the
scope
of
his
employment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
correct
that
in
that
case
he
can
get
the...
a
state
judge
to
review
the
united
states
attorney
general's
refusal
to
certify?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
thinking
in
cases
in
which
the
united
states
refused
to
certify...
the
(d)(3)
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
don't
quite
understand
why
that
plain
language
carries
you
that
far.
because
it
does
carry
it...
there
shall
be
removal...
but
does
that
preclude
necessarily
the
judicial
review
of
the
determination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
that
there's
substitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
can't
you?
i
mean
it
doesn't
foreclose
it.
it
just
says
there
shall
be
substitution
and
removal.
but
having
been
removed,
why
does
that
foreclose
treating
the
defendant
just
like
you
treat
the
plaintiff?
because
on
one
hand
it
says
it
is
subject
to
review.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
you
have
to
get
outside
this
statute,
then
it
isn't
quite
as
plain
as
you
were
representing
it
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
always
subject
to
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
said,
well,
we
took
a
second
look
at
it
and
say
they
weren't...
those
criteria--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
thing
here.
the
criteria
are
whether
he's
in
the
scope
of
employment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
certainly
the
attorney
general
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
certify
if
the
man
was
not
in
the
scope
of
his
employment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's...
and
it
is
reviewable
in
some
situations,
you
admit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that's
correct
to
say
that
it's
against
the
government's
interest.
because
a
government
typically
protect
their
employees,
even
when
they're...
when
they're
sued
for
things
that
might
be
outside
the
scope
of
the
employment.
because
there
is
an
interest
in
the
morale
of
the
work
force
to
give
them
protection
of
this
kind.
it's
not
necessarily
entirely
against
the
government's
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
they're
willing
to
have
the
federal
government
pick
up
the
tab
on
the
liability...
is
what
they're--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
that's
in
the
overall
best
interest
of
the
work
force
and
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
question
about
the
word
"shall"...
great
emphasis
on
it?
is
it
not
true
that
you
can
leave
the
statute
with
all
the
"shalls"
that
are
in
it
as
it
is
now
and
then
add
a
sentence
at
the
end
providing,
however,
the
determine
shall
be
subject
to
judicial
review?
they
don't
need
the
"shalls"...
just
because
you've
got
them...
to
get
the
case
moving.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
point
is
that
the
"shalls"
don't
resolve
the
question
of
judicial
review.
they
just
resolve
the
question
of
initially
move...
movability
and
initial
substitution.
but
it
wouldn't
be
"however"
to
be
provided,
however,
that
if
the
court
finds
that...
that
the
certification
was
incorrect,
the
united
states
shall
not
be
substituted?
