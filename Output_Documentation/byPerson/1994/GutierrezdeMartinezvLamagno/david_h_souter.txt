well,
i...
i
take--
--do
we
know...
i
mean
i
suppose
one
of
the
considerations
to
bear
in
mind
in...
in
trying
to
infer
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
the
risk
that
it
might
have
been
guarding
against...
and
do
we
know...
do
you
know
either
in
gross
figures
or
in
percentage
terms
how
frequently
the
certification
in
fact
results
in
a
situation
like
this
in
which
the
united
states
ends
up
claiming
an
immunity
so
that
there
can
be
no
recovery
against
anybody?
