justice
antonin
scalia
this...
this
accident
occurred
after
the
westfall
act
was
passed?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
before?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
as
though
the
right
to
sue
existed
and
then
the
act
took
it
away.
the
act
said,
when
the
accident
occurred,
that
this
might
happen.
that...
that
the
attorney
general
might,
in...
in
effect,
say
you
can't
sue
this
individual?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
is
that
a
denial
of
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
they
changed
that
before
this
accident--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose...
suppose
the
federal
government
says,
ex
ante,
before...
before
an
accident
occurs,
they...
they
say
you
cannot
sue
personally
any
federal
employee?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
they
just
say,
you
know,
we...
we
have
made
the
determination
that
suits
against
federal
employees
are
so
much
trouble,
they
are
so
distracting
to...
to
their
execution
of
their
duties
that
one
of
the
perquisites
of
federal
employment
is
you
are
to
be
immune
from
civil
tort
suits,
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
denial
of...
of
equal...
of
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
just
one
step
short
of
that.
it
says
not
all
of
them
will
be,
but
only
those
that
the
attorney
general
says
shall
be,
shall
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
wait.
i...
i'm...
i
was
not
speaking
to
the
point
of
whether
the
act
removed
judicial
review.
i
was
speaking
to
your
argument
that
if
it
did
re...
remove
judicial
review,
it
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
all
i'm
speaking...
yes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
said...
you
said
it
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
leaving
it
to
the
attorney
general
is
what...
is
what
causes
it
to
be
a
denial
of
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course,
you're
making
an
argument
of
a
property
right.
it's
a
fine
argument
when
the
statute
is
passed
after
the
cause
of
action
arises.
but
this
statute
was
passed
before
the
cause
of
action
arises.
so
the...
so
the
point
can
be
made
that
the...
that
the
cause
of
action,
when
it
sprung
up,
was
automatically
limited
by...
by
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
no
cause
of
action
expected
or
anticipated,
except
one
that
was
subject
to
this
attorney
general's
specification.
justice
antonin
scalia
let...
let
me
ask
one...
one
more
variation
about
the
due
process
question.
would
you
have
the
same
due
process
objection
if
the
statute
did
not
say
that
the
attorney
general
would
certify
that
the
individual
was
acting
within
the
course
of
his
employment,
but
simply
said,
if
the
attorney
general
says,
no
cause
of
action,
there
shall
be
no
cause
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he's
not
finding
any
facts.
he's
just
saying
i
don't
want
this
guy
sued.
he's
not
finding
any
facts
at
all.
so
there
are
no
facts
for
courts
to
review.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
your
clients
american
citizens?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
accident
occurred
in
colombia?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they're
protected
by
the
due
process
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
whole
world
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
american
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
whole...
the
whole
world
has
a
right
protected
by
the
united
states
constitution
to
litigate
in
virginia?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
the
frenchman
is
protected
by
the
united
states
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
new
to
me.
why...
why
on
earth
does
the
due
process
clause
extend
to
a
citizen
of
france,
who
is
injured
in...
who
is
injured
in
france?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
suggested
in
your
brief.
i
think
the
argument--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
the
point
in
your
brief
that
most
troubles
me,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
point
isn't
that
it's
unconstitutional;
your
point
is
that
it
would
be...
since
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
it
were
interpreted
the...
the
way
you
don't
want
it
interpreted,
we
shouldn't
interpret
it
that
way.
we
should
avoid
the
constitutional
difficulty.
that's
your
argument;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
contains
more
than
similar
language,
it
goes
on
to
say,
(2)...
which
relates
to
removal...
it
says,
"this
certification
of
the
attorney
general
shall
conclusively
establish
scope
of
office
or
employment
for
purposes
of
removal.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
when...
when
something
is
removed?
you
have
to
accept
the...
i
mean
it's
clear
from
(2)
that...
that
you
must
accept
the...
the
scope
of
employment
determination
for
purposes
of
removal,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
very
strange,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
basis
for
jurisdiction
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
even...
even
assuming
that
it's
constitutional
to
do
that...
and
i
think
there
is
some
question
about
it...
it
is
certainly
weird
to
do
that.
to
say
it
must
remain
in
federal
court,
but
allow
the
federal
court
to
decide...
and
require
the
federal
court
to
decide
that
in
fact
this
is
not
a
scope
of
federal
employment
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
not
allow
the
federal
court,
once
having
decided
that,
to
send
it
back
to
the
state
court.
that's
very,
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
protect
defendants
from
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
should
have
said
it's
the
plaintiffs
that...
that
have
to
be
protected
from
you,
right,
not
the
defendants.
i
misspoke.
the
defendant
can
come
to
court,
but
the
plaintiff
can't?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
steward,
i...
i
must...
i'm
really
impressed
with
the
generosity
of
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
you
have
a
statute
that
says
"shall"
categorically.
and...
and...
and
you
argue
to
us
that
that
does
not
mean
"shall".
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
other
areas
where
there
is
much
less
clear
language
about
judicial
review...
in
immigration,
in...
in
review
of...
of
administrative
determinations
concerning
federal
employment
matters.
can
we
take
it
to
be
the
consistent
position
of
the
united
states
that
there
should
always
be
judicial
review?
is...
is
that
a
new...
a
new
approach
that
the
government
is
going
to
take?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
see
the
attorney
general
coming
in
and
saying,
dea
agents,
you
don't
know,
your
honor,
what
the
dea
agent
is
like.
i
mean
the
argument
here
is
that
he
is
always
on
duty.
he
is
always
on
duty.
always
dressed
to
look
like
a...
like
a
drug
dealer,
and
even
when
he
walks
down
the
street
he's
on
duty.
your
honor,
you
can't
possibly
know
what
it's
like.
i,
the
attorney
general,
know
that.
this
is
not
an
expertise
area?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
require
the
determination
to
be
made
at
all
then?
i
mean
why
not
just
leave
it
to
the...
i
thought
the
purpose
of
the
determination
was
to
get
this
thing
done
right
away,
so
the
employee
doesn't
have
to
litigate
this
matter
in
court.
you
know,
a
quick
determination.
but
you're
saying
it's
going
to
have
to
be
litigated
anyway,
even
if
there
is
the
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there's
no
doubt
that
congress
did
just
that
with
respect
to
removal
at
least.
because
with
respect
to
removal,
congress
did
say,
"and
we
really
mean
it",
right,
with...
with
that
spec...
separate
provision
that
says...
and
the
only
question
is
whether
they
did
a
similar
thing
with
respect
to...
to
liability
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
acknowledge
that
it
once
existed?
i
mean,
surely
a
proper
analog,
as
i
understand
your
brief,
would
be
a
situation
in
which
it
was
thought
that
one
of
the
parties
was
from
another
state,
and
then
it
is
discovered
in
the
federal
court
that
he
was
never
from
another
state.
that's
the
proper
analog.
here
it
was
thought
the
person
was...
was
within
the
scope
of
employment,
and
it
turns
out
that
he
wasn't
within
the
scope
of
employment.
so
that
ex
ante,
when
the
suit
was
filed,
the...
the
predicate
of
jurisdiction
did
not
exist
in
this
case;
isn't...
isn't
that
the
proper
analog?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
you'd
say
you
don't
really
get
down
to
the...
to
the
implications
when
you
have
a
"shall"?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kellogg,
could
you
say
something
about
the...
the
due
process
argument?
i
mean
the
arguments
made
that
we
should
interpret
"shall"
to
mean
something
other
than
"shall"
because
of
the
constitutional
problems
that
arise
otherwise.
is
there
a
constitutional
due
process
problem
about
taking
away
a
cause
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
the
greater
doesn't
always
include
the
lesser.
here...
here
they...
they
said
we're
going
to
leave
it
up
to
a
single
federal
official
to
decide
whether
you
have
a
cause
of
action
or
not.
is
it...
is
that
in
accord
with
due
process
of
law?
can
you
give--
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
a
certification
is
reviewable
somehow
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
final
agency
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
not
conceivable
that
apart
from
this
procedure,
apart
from
challenging
it
when...
when
the...
when
the
certification
is
made
to...
to
the
court
that
has
the
tort
action,
might
there
not
be
an
action
against
the...
let's
suppose
an
attorney
general
who
is...
or
a
u.s.
attorney
who
is
making
these
certifications
just
randomly,
just
in
order
to
help
both
the
employee
at
no
expense
to
the
government,
without
any
investigation
whatever...
is
there
a
possibility
of
a
separate
action
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
get
that...
to
get
that
decision
overturned?
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
have
a
different
standard
to
review.
the
court
wouldn't
determine
it
de
nova.
it
would
simply
determine
whether...
whether
the...
the
u.s.
attorney's
action
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
would
be
quite
different
from
what...
what...
what
is...
what
is
asked
for
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
understand
you
either.
you
mean
on
the
basis
of
the
other
side's
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
know
it's
the
united
states
when
you
get
to
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
on
the
basis
of
your
case,
you
do
know?
