but
could...
it
could
well
be
that
the
scheme
makes
a
lot
more
sense
if
we
just
say
that
it's
not
reviewable
at
all,
whether
it's
for
removal
or
anything
else...
once
that
certification
is
filed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
of
course
i
assume
that
the
united
states
administratively
could
nevertheless
allow
the
claim
in
this
case
even
though
the
united
states
itself
wouldn't
be
liable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
couldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
and
presumably
the
government
is
still
considering
this
claim?
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
mr.
stewart,
do
you
have...
i'm
sorry...
before
you
get
off
this
point...
or
the
government
could
review
the
attorney
general's
determination.
set
up
some
board
to
review
it.
i
mean
it's
very
strange
the
government
is
coming
in
and
asking
us
to
protect
defendants
from
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let...
let
me
ask
you
this.
does
the
attorney
general
sometimes
come
in
and
say
yes
this
per...
this
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment,
but
the
accident
didn't
occur
or
the
events
didn't
occur?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
what
kind
of
a
certification
is
entered
then?
do
you
say,
i
certify
the
employee
was
acting
within
the
employment,
but
it
didn't
happen,
or
what
do
you
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
don't
think
the
language
is
somehow
inadequate,
do
you,
when
it
says
"shall
be
substituted"?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
they
have
to
say
"and
we
really
mean
it"
or
what?
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
a
case
gets
to
the
federal
court
on
the
basis
that
the
employee
was
a
federal
employee.
and
under
your
theory,
if
the
certification
is
filed
by
the
attorney
general
that
the
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment,
that
ends
the
matter.
and
the
court
then
cannot
ever
inquire
into
the
basis
of
its
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
is
kind
of
curious,
isn't
it?
