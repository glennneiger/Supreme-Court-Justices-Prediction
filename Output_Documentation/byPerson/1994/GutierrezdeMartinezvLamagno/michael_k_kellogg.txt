mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
only
part
of
the
language
or
structure
of
the
westfall
act
that
the
government
is
able
to
rely
on
at
all
to
try
to
undermine
the
mandatory
language
of
the
statute
is
subsection
(d)(2),
which
says
that
certification
shall
be
conclusive
for
purposes
of
removal.
the
united
states
tries
to
argue
that
the
implication
of
that
provision
is
that
it's
not
conclusive
for
purposes
of
substitution.
there
are
several
reasons
why
that
implication
doesn't
hold.
first
of
all,
as
mr.
maloney
pointed
out,
it
does
not
change
the
mandatory
language
used
in
the
rest
of
the
statute
that
says
the
united
states
shall
be
substituted,
period.
the
only
condition
precedent
for
substitution
listed
in
the
statute
is
certification.
it's
the
only
event
that
the
district
court
is
charged
with
determining.
the
second
reason
the
implication
doesn't
hold
is
that
it's
counterbalanced
by
subsection
(d)(3),
which
says
that
if
the
attorney
general
does
not
certify,
then
the
plaintiff
can
seek
a
certification
from
the
court
that
he
was
in
fact
acting
within
the
scope
of
the
employment.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no,
the
plaintiff.
i
mean
the
defendant...
you're
right.
i
apologize.
the
defendant
can
seek
a
ruling
from
the
court--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--no.
because
the
statute
in,
(d)(3),
allows
the
united
states
to
remove
it
to
federal
court.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
then
the
defendant
petitions
for
certification.
the
united
states
then
removes
the
case
to
federal
court
under
(d)(3).
and
a
federal
court
judge
will
make
that
determination.
and
then,
if
he
rules
against
the
defendant...
says
he
was
acting
outside
the
scope
of
employment...
the
case
is
remanded
to
state
court.
but
by
providing
a
specific
provision
that
says
certification
is
reviewable
at
the
behest
of
the
defendant,
with
no
corresponding
provision
saying
it's
reviewable
at
the
behest
of
the
plaintiff,
the
implication
there
cancels
out
the
implication
that
the
government
tries
to
draw
from
(d)(3)...
that
it's
only
conclusive
for
purposes
of
removal.
a
third
reason--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--exactly.
that's
our
first
argument.
the
statute
repeats
"shall"
several
times.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
they
cancel
out,
and
we're
left
with
the
plain
language
that
says
"shall",
and
mandates
this
result
by
the
district
court.
if
you
want
an
explanation--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--it
says
there
shall
be
substitution,
period.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
now,
i
don't
think
you
can
go
on
and
say,
well,
okay,
but
the
district
court
could
resubstitute.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
if
you
look
at
an
analogous
statute...
let's
say
24(a)
of
the
federal--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--no,
i
think...
i
think
it
is
quite
plain.
but
if...
i
think
the
analogy
will
help
reveal
just
why
it's
so
plain.
under
24(a),
which
is
intervention
as
a
right,
it
says
if
certain
circumstances
are
met,
certain
criteria
are
met,
the...
the
person
shall
be
allowed
to
intervene.
now,
the
district
court
has
no
discretion
there.
if
those
criteria
are
met,
he
cannot
say,
okay,
you
can
intervene,
you've
met
the
criteria.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
now
get
out.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
but
those
criteria
were
not
met.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
but
the
criteria
in
the
statute
are
the
only
criteria
that
the
court
is
charged
with
determining.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
why
they
call
it
intervention
as
a
right.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no,
that
is
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
only
criteria
listed
in
the
statute
is
certification.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
attorney
general
is
charged
with
determining
whether
he's
within
the
scope
of
employment.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
at
the
behest
of
the
defendant.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--by
statute.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events,
of
course,
the
admission
of
the
attorney
general
that
the
employee
acted
within
the
scope
of
the
employment
is
going
to
be
contrary
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
and
there
was
needed
to
be
some
mechanism
which
the
defendant
employee
could
challenge
that
certification.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
there
is
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
statute
is
not
ambiguous.
it
directs
the
district
court
to
substitute
the
united
states
upon
certification.
the
second
reason
you
read
that
is
because
of
the
policy
purposes
of
having
immunity--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--the
policy
purpose
is
to
allow
the
attorney
general
to
articulate
the
circumstances
under
which
the
united
states
is
prepared
to
take
responsibility
for
the
action
of
its
employee
as
taken
within
the
scope
of
employment.
immunity
always
erects
a
barrier
which
could
lead
to
allegations
of--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--immunity--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--it's...
it's
not
handing
it
to
one
of
the
parties.
what
it
is
is
allowing
the
attorney
general
to
make
a
determination
based
upon
federal
law
as
to--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--no,
it's--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
not...
not
in
her
own
cause
of
action,
but
in
the
cause
of
action
of
her
employee.
in
the
vast
bulk
of
cases--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--in
the
vast
bulk
of
cases,
as
you
yourself
pointed
out,
the
admission
of
the
attorney
general
that
the
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment
will
be
essentially
against
interest.
it
will
be
something
that
the
plaintiff
will
want.
it's
only
in
the
small
number
of
cases
where
the
united
states
has
retained
an
immunity,
so
that
it
is
itself
not
subject
to
suit,
that
the
attorney
general's
certification--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--no,
that's
the
whole
point
of
immunity,
of
course.
congress
made
a
judgement
that
federal
employees
were
particularly
vulnerable
to
suit,
and
that
they
needed
this
sort
of
protection.
now,
if
you
breach
that
barrier--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct,
they...
they
are.
if
you
breach
that
barrier--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
your
answer,
quite
frankly,
was...
was
perfectly
correct
on
that
point.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
statute
was
passed
before
the
acts
in
question
occurred.
congress
could
have
passed
a
broader
statute,
cutting
off
any
suits
whatsoever
against
federal
employees.
therefore,
it
can
do
the
lesser
of
allowing
the
attorney
general
to--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--i...
i
see
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
and
i
certainly
have
not
seen
any
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
that
would
indicate
that
that
was
a
problem.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no,
i
don't
believe
that's
correct.
i
mean
you
could
have
added
a
sentence
on
there,
and
it
would
have
negated
the
natural--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
don't
believe
so,
justice...
justice
breyer.
i
think
the
key
point
here
is
that
the
determination
by
the
attorney
general
as
to
scope
of
employment
is
itself
under
the
common
law
generally
regarded
as
an
admission
or
a
ratification
of
the
acts
of
that
employee.
i
know
of
no
separation
of
powers
or
due
process
problem
in
allowing
an
employer
to
ratify
or
acknowledge
scope
of
employment
on
behalf
of
its
employee.
now,
ordinarily,
of
course,
under
the
common
law,
the
plaintiff
could
then
proceed
against
both
the
defendant
employee
and
the
employer
who
admits
responsibility--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that
is
precisely
what
this
court,
in
united
states
v.
smith
acknowledged
was
the
result
of
the
westfall
act,
and
the
intent
of
congress.
that
even
when
it
cuts
off
a
ordinary,
common
law
tort
action
against
the
employee
and
against
the
united
states,
it
is
still
precluded
by
the
act.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no,
there
was
no
judicial
determination--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--there
was
no
determination
in
smith.
there
was
merely
the
certification
of
the
attorney
general.
and
in
smith
this
court
indicated
that
that
certification
was
sufficient
to
require
substitution.
the
precise
issue
here--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct.
the
precise
issue
here
was
not
raised
there.
but
the
court's
discussion--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct.
but
the
court's
discussion
certainly
indicates
an
assumption
as
to
how
the
statutory
scheme
worked.
that
upon
certification,
the
united
states
was
required
to
be
substituted.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i...
i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia,
because
this
statute
really
sort
of
occupies
the
field,
and
sets
up
its
own
standards
for
how
the
determination
is
made.
besides
which,
i...
i
view
this
decision
in
the
light
of
a
discretionary
determination
by
the
attorney
general.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
was
unable
to
find
any.
i
looked
in
the
u.s.
attorneys
manuals
and
could
not
find
any.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
but
we
do
know
that
under
the
united
states'
view,
scope
of
employment
in
this
case
would
be
determined
under
the
law
of
colombia,
which
would
lead
to
all
sorts
of
problems
as
to
whether
a
federal
agent
is
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
federal
employment.
it
would
make
considerably
more
sense
to
have
that
determination
made
by
the
attorney
general
or
delegated
to
a
u.s.
attorney,
to
try
to
determine
some
sort
of
uniform
federal
standards,
rather
than
have
the
agent
subject
to
the
vagaries
of
whatever
law
of
whatever
country
he
happens
to
be
in.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i
think--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--i
think--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--true.
i
think
as...
as
an
initial
matter,
there
would
be
potentially
rule
11
sanctions
in
the
court,
where
the
attorney
general
or
the
u.s.
attorney
makes
this
certification.
i
mean
it
is
not
something
that
the
attorney
general
or
the
u.s.
attorney
is
likely
to
take
lightly.
because
they
do
have
to
go
into
court.
they
do
have
to
say,
we've
looked
into
these
circumstances.
we
are
certifying
this.
it's
a
representation
to
the
court
that
puts
the
credibility
of
the
united
states
on
the
line,
and
subjects
them
to
potential
rule
11
sanctions.
now,
whether
there
also
be
some
potential--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
in...
in
many
instances,
you'll
find
where
a
particular
side
wins
the
argument,
but
still
could
be
subject
to
rule
11
sanctions
for
misrepresenting
some
aspect.
the
court,
for
purposes
of
substitution,
cannot
look
behind
it.
but
if
the
court
had
reason
to
believe
that
in
fact
no
investigation
had
been...
had
been
conducted
or
that
it
was
done
randomly
or
arbitrarily,
it
is
a
representation
to
the
court,
subject
to
rule
11.
i'd
like
to
raise
a
final
point
about
the
article
iii
problems
in
this
case.
because
i
think
they
are
quite
substantial,
if
one
takes
the
united
states'
view
of
the
statute.
i
agree
absolutely
with
justice
scalia's
point
that
when
this
case
reaches
federal
court,
it
is
not
necessarily
a
case
against
the
united
states.
the
question
of
the
proper
defendant
is
precisely
the
question
that
the
united
states
says
the
district
court
is
going
to
resolve.
and
until
that
question
is
resolved,
the
identity
of
the
defendant
is
not
determined.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
does
say,
"shall
be
substituted",
but
if
it's
subject
to
review
by
the
district
court,
then--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--right.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
right.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
you
do
know.
it
is
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
and
therefore
there
is
no
jurisdictional
problem,
because
it's
a
suit
against
the
united
states
that's
clearly
covered
by
article
iii.
but
on
the
solicitor
general's
view,
if
the
defendant
is
properly
identified
as
the
employee
because
he
was
acting
outside
of
the
scope
of
employment,
then
there
is
no
federal
question--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--pendant
jurisdiction
involves
two
claims
generally.
one--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--because
i
don't
think
it
makes
sense
to
say
it
came
in
on
a
good
basis
if
it's
the
district
court
that
makes
the
determination,
not
the
attorney
general.
