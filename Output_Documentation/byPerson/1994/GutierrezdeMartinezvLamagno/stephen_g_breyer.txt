stephen
g.

but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
but
can
you
go
back
for
a
minute,
which
i...
i
thank
you
very
much
for
your
brief,
by
the
way,
which
was
very
helpful.
and
the
one
thing
i
found
missing
in
this...
because
i
do
think
it's
ambiguous
and
i'd
like
you
to
address...
is
what
i'd
call
a
page
of
history.
i
mean
if
you
go
back
to
gregoire
and
biddle
and
learned
hand,
people...
plaintiffs
could
sue
government
employees,
but
they
couldn't
recover
if
it
was
within
the
scope
of
their
employment;
right?
then
this
court,
in
westfall,
limited
that;
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
said,
well,
sometimes
you
can.
but
what
they
were
limiting
was
a
plaintiff's
right
to
recover
if
it
wasn't
in
the
scope
of
employment,
as
decided
by
a
judge
and
a
jury.
that
was
the
original
right.
so
why
in
heaven's
name
would
we
read
this
statute
not
simply
to
restore
scope
of
employment,
but
also
to
say
the
plaintiff
no
longer
has
a
right
to
that
decision
by
a
judge
and
a
jury?
so
that
if,
to
take
a
case
out
of
the
first
circuit,
there
is
an
allegation
that
an
employee
raped
a
woman
on
the
job...
that
wasn't
quite
the
case,
but
it
was
a
sexual
assault...
whether
or
not
that
occurred
will
be
decided
not
by
a
judge
or
a
jury,
but
by
the
attorney
general.
why
would
one
read
an
ambiguous
statute
to
reach
a
result
like
that,
that
is
so
contrary
to
the
history
of
this
area
of
the
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
policy
purposes
of
having
the
attorney
general
decide
whether
an
assault
and
battery
took
place,
the
policy
and
purposes
for
having
the
attorney
general
decide
the
facts
of
the
case,
to
decide...
the
attorney
general
should
decide
if
the
action
is
taken
away
from
the
plaintiff
rather
than
a
judge
and
a
jury...
or
at
least
a
judge?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
immunity
always
is
decided
after
an
initial
determination,
say,
by
an
agency
or
someone,
by
the
judge
or
the
jury
or
both.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
something
in
the
legislative
history
that
says
that
congress
wanted
not
only
to
restore
scope
of
immunity...
scope
of
employment
immunity,
but
also
to
take
the
plaintiff's
right
to
have
review
of
that
question
by
a
judge
and
hand
it
to
one
of
the
parties
in
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
about
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
you--
--i
wondered
about
a
different
constitutional
problem.
now,
i
don't
know
if
this
really
exists
or
not.
and
that's
why
i'd
appreciate
your
view.
but
there's
a
line
of
cases
in
this
court
that
talk
about
a
constitutional
separation
of
powers
problem
that
arises
when
you
take
a
common
variety...
common,
garden
variety
tort
action
and
you
say
that
common,
garden
variety
tort
action
is
no
longer
going
to
be
decided
by
a
court;
it's
going
to
be
decided
by
an
administrator.
they
go
back
to
crowell
&
benson,
shore,
marathon.
now,
here...
here,
in
fact,
even
in
crowell
&
benson,
you
could
take
a
common
variety
tort
action
and
give
it
to
an
administrator
because
there
was
judicial
review
of
that
administrator's
decision.
now,
here,
i
take
it,
you
would
be
taking
a
common,
garden
variety
tort
action,
handing
it
not
to...
really,
over
to
the
attorney
general
to
decide,
and
there
would
be
no
judicial
review
of
that
attorney
general's
decision
on
that
common,
garden
variety
tort
action.
now,
what
i
wonder
is,
doesn't
that
raise
some
kind
of
constitutional
problem
under
shore,
crowell
&
benson,
marathon,
and
all
those
cases
that
worry
about
taking
tort
actions
away
from
judges
and
juries
and
giving
them
to
federal
or
state
administrators?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
any
different
from
pendant
jurisdiction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
here
they
came
into
federal
court
on
a
good
basis.
there's
a
suit.
it's
determined
that,
hey,
this
is
a
simple
assault
and
battery.
the
attorney...
it's
not
in
the
scope
of
employment
at
all.
the
federal
forum
remains.
it
came
in
on
a
good
basis.
why
can't
it
remain
pendant,
just
like
a
state
pendant
claim?
