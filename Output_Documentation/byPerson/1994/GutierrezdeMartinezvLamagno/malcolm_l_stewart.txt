mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
under
the
westfall
act,
the
attorney
general's
scope
certification
is
subject
to
review
by
a
court
at
the
behest
of
a
tort
plaintiff.
the
large
majority
of
courts
of
appeals
to
have
addressed
the
question
have
also
concluded
that
the
scope
certification
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
that
view
is
consistent
with
the
text
of
the
westfall
act
and
with
the
strong
presumption
that
administrative
action
is
judicially
reviewable.
moreover,
to
permit
judicial
review
of
the
attorney
general's
scope
certification
does
not
render
the
act
susceptible
to
a
challenge
based
on
article
iii.
first,
the
text
of
the
act
does
not
definitively
resolve
the
interpretive
question
that
this
case
presents.
respondent,
in
his
amicus,
placed
principal
reliance
on
the
statute's
use
of
the
word
"shall".
and
in
johnson
v.
carter,
the
predecessor
fourth
circuit
case
to
this
one,
the
fourth
circuit
also
concluded
that
the
word
"shall"
reflected
an
unambiguous
congressional
intent
to
preclude
review
of
the
certification.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
word
2679
(d)(1)
says,
"upon
certification
by
the
attorney
general
that
the
defendant
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
office
or
employment--
"
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
"upon
certification
by
the
attorney
general
that
the
defendant
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
office
or
employment
at
the
time
of
the
incident
out
of
which
the
claim
arose,
any
civil
action
or
proceeding
commenced
upon
such
claim
in
the
united
states
district
court
shall
be
deemed
an
action
against
the
united
states
under
the
provisions
of
this
title
and
all
references
thereto,
and
the
united
states
shall
be
substituted
as
the
party
defendant.
"
and
2679
(d)(2)
contains
similar
language
with
respect
to
actions
that
are
commenced
in
state
court.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
right.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
our
position
is
that
if
the
attorney
general
certifies
in
a
case
that
arises
in
state
court,
and
the
case
is
removed
to
federal
district
court,
and
the
district
court
reviews
the
certification
and
determines
that
the
defendant
employee
was
not
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment,
the
case,
nevertheless,
remains
in
federal
court
because
of
the...
the
conclusive
(d)(2).
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
it's
certainly
the
normal
rule
in--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the...
the
normal
rule
of
federal
jurisdiction,
obviously,
is
that
a
federal
defense,
by
itself,
won't
confer
jurisdiction.
and
that's
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule.
but
as
a
constitutional
matter,
it's
certainly
clear
that
congress
may
provide
a
federal
forum
when
the
cause
of
action
arises
under
state
law,
but
if
a
viable
or
colorable
federal
defense
is
asserted...
as
this
court
said
in
mesa
v.
california.
and
essentially,
we
read
2679
(d)(2)
to
reflect
a
congressional
determination
that
where
the
attorney
general
has
certified,
the
federal
defense
at
least
remains
colorable.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think,
as
mr.
kellogg
has
pointed
out
in
his
brief,
there
is
a
divergence
of
opinion
among
the
circuits
as
to
the
factors
to
be
taken
into
account
in
certifying
and
the
factors
to
be
taken
into
account
in
judicial
review.
and,
in
particular,
the
dispute
pertains
to
the
question
of
whether
the
plaintiffs'
allegations
should
be
taken
as
true
in
making
the
initial
certification
and
in
conducting
judicial
review
thereof.
and
at
least
on
some
occasions,
the
attorney
general
will
base
her...
or
her
designee...
will
base
the
scope
determination
on
the
view
that
the
acts,
as
alleged
in
the
complaint,
are
within
the
scope.
the
district
court
may
disagree
with
that
determination...
may
determine
that
if
the
facts,
as
alleged,
were
proved
to
a
tee,
the
defendant
employee
would
be
acting
with
the...
outside
of
his
scope
of
employment.
but
the
possibility
still
remains
that
the
facts,
as
proved
at
trial,
would
establish
tortious
conduct,
but
conduct
within
the
scope
of
employment.
and
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
certainly--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--in
this
case
there
is,
21
u.s.c.
904,
the
administrative
claim
procedure
to
which
mr.
rodriguez
referred...
doesn't
apply
across
the
board.
it
says
that,
notwithstanding
the
foreign
tort
exception,
the
department
of
justice
may
settle
administratively
a
claim
based
on
the
actions
of
one
of
its
employees
abroad.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it's--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there
is
certainly
something
unusual
about
the
department
of
justice
affirmatively
asserting
the
position
that
one
of
its
acts
is
judicially
reviewable.
and
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
that
we
are
here
today.
the
first
is
that
the
court
has
often
stressed
that
there
is
a
strong
presumption
in
favor
of
judicial
review
of
executive
action;
that
that
presumption
is
overcome
only
in
very
unusual
circumstances;
and,
consequently,
we
feel
an
obligation
not
to
assert
a
non-reviewability
argument
unless
there
are
compelling
reasons
for
it.
the
second
is
that
during
congressional
consideration
of
the
bill
that
became
the
westfall
act,
we
represented
to
congress
our
view
that
under
the
act,
the
scope
certification
would
be
judicially
reviewable.
that's
not
binding
us
on
it,
but
i
think
the
department
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
the
statute
says
specifically
that
if
the
attorney
general
declines
to
certify
scope,
the
defendant
employee
may
seek
a
determination
from
the...
the
district
court.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
and
to
respond
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
to
hold
that
the...
the
certification
is
not
judicially
reviewable
obviously
would
take
the
courts
out
of
resolving
a
lot
of
questions
that
the...
the
courts
have
found
difficult
and...
and
troubling.
i
don't--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that...
that
has
sometimes
been
the
base...
basis
of
the
scope
certification;
that
a
tort
was
alleged
to
have
occurred.
the
attorney
general
or
her
designee
investigates
the
circumstances
and
concludes
that,
at
the
time
the
wrongful
conduct
was
alleged
to
have
happened,
the
defendant
employee
in
fact
engaged
in
no
tort,
but
was
simply
going
about
his
or
her--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
typically,
the
certification
itself
would
be
a
fairly
sparse
document.
a
certification
would
simply
say
something
to
the
effect
of
this
on;
that
i've
investigated
the
circumstances
of...
of
the
allegations
and
have
concluded
that
the
defendant
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment
at
the
time
of...
of
the
alleged
incident.
typically,
there
would
be
supporting
papers,
either
a
memorandum
in
support
of
the
notion
of
notice
of
substitution
or
an
affidavit
that
would
flesh
out
the
basis
for
the
conclusion.
i
think
here
we
had
something
of
a
truncated
proceeding
because
the
scope
certification
was
undertaken
immediately
after
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
johnson
v.
carter.
and
i
think
it's
likely
that
because
the
fourth
circuit
had
very
squarely
held
there
would
be
no
judicial
review,
there
was
probably
less
of
a...
a
sense
of
a
need
to
make
a
record,
and
certain--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
although
if
the
plaintiff
wanted
to
seek
judicial...
again,
under
the
view
of
most
circuits,
and
under
the
view
that
we
believe
is
the
correct
one,
of
the
westfall
act--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
plaintiff
could
seek
a
judicial
review
of
that...
that
process.
i
think
the
proper
construction--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
i
think
the
class
of
cases
in
which
the
certification
is
challenged
tends
to
be
an
unrepresentative
sample
of
tort
suits
against
federal
employees.
because
the...
the
challenge
is
generally
made
when
there
appears
likely
to
be
an
exception,
barring
suit
against
the
government
under
the
ftca.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
either
in
gross
terms
or...
or
percentage
terms.
and
to
some
degree
it
would
depend
on
the
perspicuity
of
plaintiff's
lawyer.
that
is,
if
all
plaintiff's
lawyers
were
fully
aware
of
the
ram...
of
all
the
ramifications
of
what
they
did,
presumably
they
would
not
name
the
individual
defendant...
a
employee...
as
the
defendant
to
begin
with
unless
they
suspected
there
was
some
bar
to
suit
against
the...
the
united
states
under
the
ftca.
so
that
might
affect
the
calculus.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i...
i
guess
i'd
have...
i
guess
i'd
have
three
responses
to
that.
first,
the...
the
kind
of
situations
in
which
we
would
most
want
to
assert
a
non-reviewability
argument
would
be
those
in
which
the
administrative
decis...
determination
rested
on
the
exercise
of
discretion
or
involved
a
substantive
area
that
courts
were
ill-equipped
to
consider...
such
as
the
national
security
area.
here,
as
to
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
individual
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment
at
a
particular
time,
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
courts
resolve
all
the
time.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
clearly
there
are
some...
some
cases
at
the
margins
in
which
normal
scope
of
employment
principles
will
be
more
difficult
to
apply
to
a
particular
government
employee.
but
i
think
the
vast
bulk
of
cases
will
involve
federal
employees
who
were
performing
fairly
traditional
tasks.
they
will
call...
judicial
review
will
call
upon
the
courts
to
perform
fairly
traditional
functions.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the...
i
think
the
proper--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i...
two
questions.
i
think
the
proper
understanding
of
the
word
v.
smith,
which
this
court
decided
about
four
terms
ago.
and
in
smith,
the...
it
involved
a
medical
doctor
accused
of
malpractice.
the
attorney
general
certified
that
that
doctor
had
been
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment.
and
the
plaintiff
said,
we
don't
challenge
the
scope
determination,
but
we
nevertheless
contend
that
substitution
is
improper
because
an
ftca
exemption
would
bar
a
suit
against
the
united
states.
and
this
court
held,
no,
when
the
defendant
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope,
that
employee
is
off
the
hook
even
if
there
is
no
recovery
under
the
ftca.
and
i
think
that's
the
gist
of
the
word
"shall".
that
if
the
certification
is
made
and
is
determined
to
be
valid,
a
court
cannot
say
for
some
other
reason,
we
will
nevertheless
resubstitute
the
individual
defendant
for
the
united
states.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
as
justice
ginsburg
quest...
ginsburg's
question
points
out,
without
knowing
the...
the
percentages,
there
will
certainly
be
a
large
number
of
cases
in
which
the
certification
will
not
be
challenged,
because
it's
not
in
the
plaintiff's
interest
to
challenge
it...
in
the
plaintiff's
interest
to
sue
the
united
states.
so,
at
least
in
a
large
class
of
cases,
the
certification
will
help
everybody
out...
will
be
of
service
to
the
plaintiff--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
and
courts...
the
attorney
general
and
reviewing
courts
have
devised
various
means
of
dealing
with
these
situations.
and
one
of
them
is
that
traditionally
the
attorney
general's
designee
has
investigated
the
circumstances
of...
of
the
alleged
in...
i'm
sorry--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
we
don't.
