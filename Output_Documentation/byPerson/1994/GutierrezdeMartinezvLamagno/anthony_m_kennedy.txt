justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
me
a
little
bit
more
about
your
due
process
argument?
what's...
what
line
of
authority...
what
precedents
from
this
court
do
you
cite
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
denial
of
due
process
when
the
certification
by
the
government
deprives
your
client
of
a
cause
of
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what's
your...
your
closest
case
in
point
from
this
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
aren't
there
instances
in
which
in
state
courts
there
is
a
pleading
of
malice
or
assault
and
battery,
and
there's
an
attempt
to
get
a
jury
trial
in
the
state
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do...
do
you,
in
any
event,
share
the
petitioners'
view
that
there
are
some
constitutional
concerns
if,
say,
a
state
cause
of
action
in...
before
a
jury
trial,
was
foreclosed
by
reason
of
the
certification
that's
non-reviewable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you...
you
mean
you
can't
name
the
employee
as
a...
as
a
second
party?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
allegation
is
the
employee
acted...
it
was
an
assault
and
battery
or
acted
with
malice,
i
assume
that's
beyond
recovery
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
you
can
only
bring
one
suit
against
the
government?
that's
not
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
reason
being
that
the
admission
was
adverse
to
the
dec...
declarant's
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
here...
but
here,
the...
the
admission
is
taken
as
defeating
a
cause
of
action,
say,
in
a
state
court
with
a
jury
trial
for
a
malicious
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's...
but
there
was
a
judicial
determination
there
of
the
fact
of
immunity.
and
that
isn't
so
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
judicial...
the
determination
here
is
a
unilateral
determination
by
the...
by
the
executive.
