mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
all
respect
to
petitioners'
representation
that
the
federal...
the
old
federal
drivers
act
did
not
contain
language
with
respect
to
judicial
review,
i'd
like
to
quote
subsection
(d)
from
the
old
federal
drivers
act,
which
is
2679,
codified
in
1982.
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
well,
on
page
9
of
respondent's
brief.
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
"should
a
united
states
district
court
determine
on
a
hearing
on
a
motion
to
remand
held
before
a
trial
on
the
merits
that
the
case
so
removed
is
one
in
which
a
remedy
by
suit
within
the
meaning
of
subsection
(b)
of
this
section
is
not
available
against
the
united
states,
the
case
shall
be
remanded
to
state
court.
"
that's
pretty
clear
language,
i
believe,
that
empowers
the
courts,
as
that
statute
was
written,
to
review
scope
of
the
employment
issues,
to
review
the
attorney
general's
certification.
that
empowered...
that
gave
the
courts
that
power.
the
new
westfall
act
passed
in
1980...
88...
took
that
power
away.
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
it
clearly
articulates
that
the
united
states
district
court
is
making
a
determination
on
a
hearing.
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
stat...
the
subsection
here
goes
on
to
say,
when
there's
not
an
available
remedy
against
the
united
states,
which
implies
that
what
they're
talking
about
is
where
the
district
court
found
that
the
certification
for
some
reason
was
invalid,
or
that
a
district
court
found
that
the
employee
was
not
acting
in
the
scope
of
his
employment,
and
therefore
had
the
ability
to
remand
that
case
to
the
state
court.
the
reading
that
the
government
and
the
third
circuit
give
on
the
(d)(2)
clause
in
the
current
westfall
act,
with
respect
to
the
language
of
"conclusive
for
purposes
of
removal",
is
a
strange
reading.
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
well,
that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
design
was
if
he
was
acting
in
the
scope
of
his
employment,
the
indi...
individual
employee
would
not
be
sued.
it
would
be
the
united
states
that
would
be...
would
be
held
accountable
for
the
employee.
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
well,
i
don't
believe
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
they
have
a
provision
that
says
there's
only
one
suit
that
can
be
brought.
and
that
is
against
the
united
states
government
if
this
employee
was
acting
in
the
scope
of
his
employment.
so
if
he
was
acting
in
the
scope
of
his
employment,
they
can
only
bring
one
lawsuit,
and
that's
against
the
government.
so
if
it's
barred
because
of
a
federal
tort
claims
exception--
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
--well,
you
can
name
him--
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
--justice
kennedy,
if
the
employee
is
held
to
be
with...
within...
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment...
and
albeit
there
are
some
intentional
torts
where
the
government
would
say
that
employee
was
not
acting
in
the
scope
of
his
employment...
but
let's
assume
for
a
second
that
he's
found
to
be
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
he
is
then
protected
under
the
act,
and
he
can't
be
sued
personally.
it's
the
united
states
that
has
to
be
sued.
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
that...
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
that
is--
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
--that's
correct.
they're
mutually
exclusive,
justice
ginsburg,
in
our
opinion.
the
government
pointed
out
that
under
the
current
westfall
act
they
give
a
interpretation
for
conclusive...
for
purposes
of
removal
under
the
(d)(2)
subsection
that
if
a
court
reviewed
the
scope
of
employment
issue,
found
the
employee
not
to
be
acting
in
the
scope
of
the
employment,
that
they
could
somehow
keep
the
case
in
federal
court.
well,
the...
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
congress
intended
to
create
this
additional
jurisdiction.
in
fact,
subsection
(d)(3)
under
the
act
specifically
says...
and...
and
i
should
draw...
step
back
for
a
second...
(d)(3)
is
the
section
that
provides...
the
only
section
under
the
westfall
act
that
provides
for
judicial
review,
and
that
is
when
an
employee
is
denied
certification.
he's
entitled
to
petition
the
court
for
review.
if,
upon
review,
the
court
finds
that
he
was
not
acting
in
the
scope
of
his
employment,
the
statute
mandates...
it
says
that
the...
the
court
shall
remand
this
case
back
to
the
state
court.
which
is
a
clear
indication
that
congress
meant
to
have
state
cases
tried
in
state
court.
the
only
reason
they
wanted
it
in
federal
court
is
because
they
assume
that
the
united
states
is
a
party
after
they
have
certified.
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
that's
correct.
i
believe
that's
what
congress
intended
in
the
legislation.
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
well,
it's...
it's...
it's
not
for
me
to
speculate.
i
believe
that's...
that
congress
was
pretty
clear
on
that,
justice
o'connor,
in
making
a
balancing
test
between
the
rights
of
plaintiffs
and
the
rights
of
federal
employees.
and
as
this
court
noted
in
the
smith
case
that
was
cited
by
my
adversary,
congress
gave
less
solicitude
for
plaintiffs'
rights
in
passing
this
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
well,
justice
scalia,
the...
the
language
in
(d)(2)...
(d)(1),
does
not
undermine
the
clear
and
plain
language
in
the
(d)(1)
clause,
which
says
that
upon
certification
by
the
attorney
general,
this
shall
be
deemed
an
action
against
the
united
states,
"and
the
united
states
shall
be
substituted.
"
that's
pretty
clear.
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
no.
if
the
plaintiff
moves
after
a
complaint
has
been
filed,
it
will
not
wreck--
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
--well,
that
wouldn't
be
different.
if
i
understand
your...
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
if
the
case
is
in
federal
court
by
virtue
of
diversity,
then
it
can
stay
in
federal
court.
there
is
a
federal
question.
there
is
a
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
diversity
action.
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
that's
correct.
and
that
was
the
presumption
that
congress
was
making...
if
the
united
states
was
a
party,
that
they
would
have
federal
jurisdiction...
even
if
there
wasn't
diversity.
and
that's
what
they...
that's
what
they
meant
by
the
language--
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
--well,
that's
correct,
under
appendant
jurisdiction,
a
district
judge--
mr.
andrew
j.
maloney,
iii
--that...
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
time.
