chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
94-167,
katia
gutierrez
de
martinez
v.
dirk
lamagno.
mr.
rodriguez.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
did
change
the
statutory
language,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
did
the
federal
drivers
act
say
about
judicial
review?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
now,
wait
a
minute.
there...
was
the
presumption
of
judicial
review
contained
in
the
language
of
the
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no;
you
can
answer
that
question
yes
or
no,
surely.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
it
any
other
kind
of
letter
law
within
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
the
argument
that
that
would
deny
due
process...
this
accident
took
place
in
colombia,
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you're
perfectly
free
to
sue
in
the
courts
of
colombia,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
before
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
you
couldn't
sue
the
government
for...
for
any
injury
inflicted
by
a...
an
employee
acting
in
the
course
of...
of
his
employment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
have
nothing
at
all
before
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
can
you
lay
venue
against
him
back
here
in
the
united
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was...
was
he
served
with
process
in
the
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
it...
yes,
but
i...
this
is
collateral,
but
i...
i
doubt
that
they
could
accept
service
for
him
personally,
could
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's...
what's
your
authority
from
this
court
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rodriguez.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
abouts
in
the
statute
does
the
word
"shall"
that
you're
referring
to--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--oh,
you're
going
a
little
fast.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
repeat?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
maloney,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
are
you
reading
from,
so
that
we
might
follow
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now
2679
(d)
just
talks
about
on
a
motion
to
remand,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
but
on
a
motion
to
remand.
and
at
least
the
westfall
act
seems
to
set
out
several
different
sections.
and
it
seems
to
treat
a
little
bit
differently
a
motion
to
remand
and
the
simple
determination
of
whether
a
suit
shall
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
maloney.
mr.
kellogg,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
that
each
side
has
an
expressio
unius
argument
going
for
it,
so
it
cancels
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it's
not...
if
it's
not
reviewable
by
the
court,
how
does
the
court
get
into
it
at
all
for
purposes
of
rule
11
sanctions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kellogg.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
