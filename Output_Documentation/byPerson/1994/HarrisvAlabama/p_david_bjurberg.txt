mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
espinosa
v.
florida,
this
court
upheld
florida's
capital
murderers
sentencing
scheme
which
also
included
a
jury
override
provision.
in
doing
so,
this
court
held
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
prevent
a
state
from
providing
for
the
so-called
dual
sentencers.
i
take
exception
to
that
characterization
of
what
alabama
law
truly
is
on
that.
the
statute
is
clear
that
only
the
judge
is
the
sentencer
in
alabama.
the
jury's
advisory
verdict
is
just
that,
it's
an
advisory
recommendation
as
to
perhaps
what
the
final
sentence
should
be.
espinosa,
this
court
said
that
this
concept
of
jury
override
was
constitutional.
now,
the
question
probably
really
boils
down
in
this
court
is,
in
florida
they
have
the
tedder
standard
that
we've
touched
on
already.
in
alabama,
we
have
a
standard
announced
by
our
supreme
court,
the
alabama
supreme
court,
saying
that
if
the
whole
catalogue
of
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances,
then
the
judge
is
allowed
to...
to--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--to
sentence
others
differently
from--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--yes,
because
the
judge
is
the
sentencer,
and
as
the
sentencer,
under
the
eighth
amendment...
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
we're
on
the
sentencing
side
of
the
eighth
amendment
business,
which
as
i
understand
this
court's
precedents
allows
for
discretion,
and
this
court's
been
very
careful
to...
any
procedure
that
cuts
back
that
discretion
has
been
found
to
violate
eddings
and
lockett.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
to
date
i
believe
we
have
approximately
26
cases
in
which
the
judge
has
chosen
to
sentence
to
death
over
a
life-without-parole
recommendation,
so
i
don't...
we
have...
approximate--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--i
cited
two
or
three
in
the
brief.
i
didn't
cite
them
all,
but
i'm
not
going
to
argue
with
the
numbers,
because
i
don't
think
we're
here
about
today.
we
rejected
the
statistical
approach
to
these
cases
in
mcclesky.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
no
override?
i
don't
know
that
number,
which
was
the
universe,
i
think,
that
justice
ginsburg
was
talking
about.
to
get
a
true
picture
of
it,
you
would
have
to
know
that
number
where
the
judge
accepts
the
life-without-parole
recommendation.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
yes.
you'd
have
to
know
that
number,
but
i
don't
think
we
ought
to
decide--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--well,
not
to
my
knowledge,
no,
and
i'm
not
sure
we
could
ever
know
that,
frankly,
so
i
take
great
exception
with
the
argument
that
alabama
does
not
have
a
standard,
it
does.
the
aggravating
circumstances
must
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances.
now,
that's
a
different
standard
before
the
judge
can
impose
the
death
sentence,
which
is
entirely
consistent
with
this
court's
eighth
amendment
precedent
of
1)
on
the
narrowing
side,
we
narrow
people
who
are
selected
for
the
death
penalty
through
the
use
of
aggravating
circumstances--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--yes,
sir,
it
can.
it
can,
and
if
a--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--no.
it's
the
same
standard,
and
i
take
exception
to
the
characterization
that
there
is
two
different
legal
standards
going
on
here.
there
aren't.
one
standard
consistently
applied
by
all
sentencers
in
alabama
is
the
aggravating
circumstances
must
outweigh
the
mitigating--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--no,
it
would
not,
because
the
sentencer
is
vested
with
discretion,
and
that's
the
essence
of
the
discretionary
process
and
whatever
weight
the
sentencer
wishes
to
give
to
these
various
factors
that
come
in
in
mitigation.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
well
i...
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
issue
is
before
the
court.
we're
up
here
on
an
eighth
amendment--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--okay.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
the
arbitrariness
versus
discretion
is
what
we're
really
at,
and
if
sentencer
a
says,
i
accept
the
jury's
verdict
and
i'm
going
to
give
it
some
weight,
is
that
a
different
legal
standard
than
saying,
well,
i...
there's
a
sliding
scale
here.
i'm
going
to
give
it--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--okay.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
a)
i
don't
think
you
have
an
eighth
amendment
arbitrariness,
because
what
you
have
is
the
sentencer
giving
this
particular
fact--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--perhaps
it
would
be
an
equal
protection
problem
in
that
similarly
situated
defendants
are
being
treated
differently.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
because
i
think
what
you
have
to
look
at
is
how
the
process
in
alabama
works.
i
mean,
certainly
under
that
hypothetical--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--well,
that's
the
crux--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--well,
i
don't
think
there
are
different
legal
standards.
each--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--yes,
it
would
be.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
well,
i
think
on
the
basic
guilt
or
innocence,
i
think
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
is,
i
find
that
the
evidence
is
sufficient
not
to
grant
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
correct.
i
mean,
i
think
that's
what
he's
saying
there.
i
think
in
the
sentencing
portion--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--on
guilt--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--yes,
i
think
it
is
consistent,
because
when
you
go
to
the
sentencing
hearing,
additional
information
concerning
the
defendant,
his
character
and...
or
her
character
in
this
case...
and
involvement
in
the
crime,
in
otherwise
those
mitigating
and
aggravating
circumstances
come
before
the
sentencer,
the
judge,
and
that
judge
can
then
weigh
those
factors
back
and
forth,
and
that's
what
this
judge
did
in
this
case.
let
me
just
quote
on
page
6
of
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--no,
there
isn't,
and
in
fact
i
think
that's
what...
the
judge
said
in
this
particular
case,
quoting
from
page
6
of
the
joint
appendix,
while
there
is
evidence
that
others
were
involved,
and
this
defendant
did
not
pull
the
trigger,
her
participation
was
such
that
but
for
her
there
probably
would
have
never
been
a
killing.
she
planned
it,
provided
the
financing,
and
stood
to
benefit
the
most,
so
i
think
that
was
one
of
the
questions
brought
up
below.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
yes.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
and
the
question
then
boils
down
to,
does
the
eighth
amendment
require
that
guidance--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--my
response
would
be
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
effect
has
given
that
guidance.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
now,
you
won't
find
that
case--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--because
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
not
determined
that
the
advisory
verdict
is
a
mitigating
circumstance--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--necessarily.
it
leaves
that
to--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--it
leaves
that
to
the
discretion
of
the
sentencer,
and
we're
saying
that
that
dis...
that
that
is
the
appropriate
place
to
leave
that
discretion.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
we
were
hypothesizing
different
legal
standards.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
no,
i
don't
believe
we
have,
in
that
we're
still
saying
that
the
sentencer
is
free
to
consider
this
jury's
advisory
verdict
and
consider
it
in
a
manner
which
the
eighth
amendment
allows
that
discretion
to
do
so.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
exactly.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
i
don't...
i
don't
think
they're
different,
in
that...
now,
because
the
sentencer
is
allowed
this
broad,
eighth
amendment
discretion
to
consider
that
advisory
verdict
as
a
mitigating
circumstance,
and
another
sentencer
might
consider
that
advisory
verdict
as
not
arising
to
that
particular
level,
in
other
words,
but
that's
inherent
in
discretion.
as
long
as
there
is
discretion
in
the
sentencer,
you're
going
to
get
different
treatments
of
essentially
the
same
thing.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
he
can...
yes.
i
mean,
the...
yes.
i
think
he
could...
he
could
say
that--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--and
he
might
have
some
view
as
to
whether
or
not
the
life-without-parole
recommendation
is
a
compromise
verdict.
as
in
this
case--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--yes,
i
think
it
would.
yes.
i
mean,
certainly
tedder--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--yes,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
but
in
alabama
we
don't
have
two
different
legal
standards.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
except
to
consider
it.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
the
statute
says,
consider
this.
take
this
into
account
when
you
ultimately
decide
your
sentence.
that's--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--the
question
is,
does
the
eighth
amendment
require
that?
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
and...
but
imposing--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--well,
perhaps
the
best
way
i
know
how
to
answer--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--yes,
it
would
be
open
to
that.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
no,
there
isn't.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
in
a
different
case,
coral,
or
coral,
he
did.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
he
did
not
give
great
weight,
because
in
other
sentencing
recommendations
that
this
particular
judge
has
written,
he
has
said,
i
give
the
jury's
recommendation
great
weight,
but
that
was
based
on
the
facts
of
that
particular
case,
and
in
coral
at
least
the
defendant
proffered
the
jury's
life-without-parole
recommendation
as
a
mitigating
circumstance,
and
the
residual
doubt,
as
in...
because
of
the
length
of
the
deliberations
of
the
jury
concerning
the
sentence,
as
mitigation.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
no,
it
wouldn't.
i
mean,
that's
inherent
in
any
fact-finding.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
because
as
i
understood
it
we
were
hypothesizing
different
legal
standards
to
be
applied
by
the
sentencer
when
considering
it.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
well,
because
if
you
have...
well,
the
discretion
is
in
the
sentencer.
i
guess
i
don't
completely
follow.
if
we're
hypothesizing
different
legal
standards,
which
we
don't
have
in
alabama,
then
there's
this
perhaps
arbitrariness
coming
in.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
no,
i
don't,
absolutely
not.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
not
to
my
remembrance.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
i
believe
so,
and
let
me
clarify
that.
the
appellate...
the
intermediate
appellate
court
doesn't
reweigh,
it
independently
weighs
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
on
appeal.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
and
in
alabama,
the
appellate
courts,
both
the--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--what
the
appellate
court
reviews,
justice
stevens,
is
the
death
sentence.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
no
presumption,
no,
sir.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
it
does,
yes.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
it
doesn't.
it
just
starts
again,
right.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
no,
i
think
it--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--yes.
between
the
two,
the
appellate
court
puts
itself
in
the
position
of
the
judge,
because
at
that
point
it
has
the
presentence
report
and
these
other--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--in
the
sense...
yes,
in
the
sense
that
it's
reviewing
the
death
sentence,
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence,
and
if
they
find--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--right,
it
did
not.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
no.
it's
a
fairly
elaborate
scheme
of
appellate
review.
first,
they
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
any
error
in
the
sentencing
proceeding.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
yes.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
it...
yes,
it
would
consider
that
in
this
process
of
the
appellate
weighing
of
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
yes,
and
that's
why
i
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
term,
reweighing.
i
mean,
that
implies
that
it's
just
a
new...
or,
repeating
the
process,
and
i
think
our
statute...
our...
well,
it
does
say
that
it's
a
independent
weighing
of
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
at
the
appellate
level,
plus
we
have
proportionality
review
that
was
alluded
to
by
ms.
friedman.
thank
you.
the
state
of--
mr.
p.
david
bjurberg
--compromise
in
the
sense
that,
justice
stevens,
it
took
them
approximately
25
minutes
to
reach
a
sentencing
decision
in
this.
perhaps,
and
i'll
admit
that
i'm
speculating
on
this
point,
that
once
they
returned
the
guilty
verdict,
then
the
compromise,
if
you
will,
was
to
return
the
life-without-parole
recommendation,
and
in
that
sense
a
compromise,
but
you're
correct,
there
are
only
two
possible
sentences,
yes.
the
state
of
alabama
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
alabama
supreme
court
and
uphold
louise
harris'
death
sentence.
