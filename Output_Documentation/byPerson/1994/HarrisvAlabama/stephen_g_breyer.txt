justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
the
question
here...
i'm
going
back
to
your
statement
that
there
is
a
standard--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
of
the
mitigating...
and
i
thought
that
their
point
is
that
the
alabama
courts
have
not
told
their
judges
a
simple
thing:
judge,
consider
this
a
mitigating
factor
like
the
other
ones
and
weigh
it,
as
you
would
any
other
mitigating
factor.
alternative
to,
judge,
this
isn't
a
mitigating
factor.
what
this
is,
just
keep
in
mind
that
other
human
beings
hearing
this
evidence
have
decided
differently
and
give
that
whatever
weight
in
your
mind
you
feel
ought
to
be
given
to
the
fact
that
1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
6,
7,
8,
9,
10,
11,
or
12
have
decided
differently
from
you.
now,
those
really
are
different
things.
judges
in
the
first
case
do
know
how
to
weigh,
and
judges
in
the
second
case,
all
the
time,
know
how
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
other
human
beings
might
decide
this
matter
differently.
but
the
alabama
supreme
court,
they
say,
has
not
told
the
judges
whether
to
do
the
one,
or
the
other,
or
a
third,
and
what
they
think
is
appropriate
as
guidance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
not
saying
a
lot
of
guidance.
they're
saying
just
that
much.
tell
them
whether
it's
another
mitigating
factor,
or
tell
them
whether
you
go
to
it
with
the
state
of
mind
that
you
might
have
with
new
trial,
directed
verdict,
any
other
situation
where
you
know
that
other
jurors...
give
them
that
much
guidance,
is
what
they're
saying,
and
what
i'm...
i'm
putting
their
argument,
i
think,
as
i
understand,
or
at
least
one
of
their
arguments,
and
i
want
to
see
what
your
response
is
directly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where?
i
didn't
see
that
one.
that
i
didn't
see.
i
did
see
that
in
a
case
which
didn't
involve
an
advisory
jury
they
talked
about
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
but
what's
the
case
where
they
say,
judge,
treat
this
jury
recommendation
as
you
would
any
other
mitigating
factor?
what's
the
name
of
the
case
where
they
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
it
or
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
it's
exactly,
that's
interesting,
that
you
find
it
happens
all
the
time.
can
you
think
of
another
example
where
in
fact
it
isn't
clear
whether
a
judge
has
to
consider
what
a
jury
says
as
if
it's...
the
distinction
i'm
drawing,
a
mitigating
factor,
i
understand
what
kind
of
thing
that
is,
and
it's
quite
a
different
thing
in
a
judge's
mind
to
ask
questions
like,
how
do
i
treat
this
advisory
jury
in
admiralty?
how
do
i
treat
the
opinion
of
the
advisory
jury
in
an
equity
matter
where
there's
also
a
matter?
how
do
i
treat
it
with
directed
verdict?
how
do
i
treat
it
on
new
trial?
how
do
i
treat
the
fact
that
other
people
have
decided
differently?
that's
the
kind
of
discrepancy
they're
trying
to
draw
a
wedge
between,
and
i
can't
think
of
any
other
example
in
the
law
where
i've
seen
this.
they're
saying,
give
us
that
much
guidance.
can
you
think
of
any
other
comparable
example?
what's
your
mind-set,
judge?
is
it
the
mind-set
of,
another
person
has
decided
this
differently
than
you,
or
is
it
the
mind-set
of,
there
is
another
mitigating
factor
out
there?
aren't
those
different,
or
are
they?
