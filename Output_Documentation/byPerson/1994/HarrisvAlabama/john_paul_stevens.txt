justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
think
the
provision
of
the
two
sentencers
as
you
describe
them
actually
increases
or
decreases
the
likelihood
of
a
death
sentence
across
the
uniform...
the
universe
of
cases
in
alabama?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
one
might
ask,
which
way
does
the
override
more
frequently
go?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
if
a
jury
does
return
a
recommendation
of
death,
normally
the
judge
accepts
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
response
to
the
state's
argument
that
the
history
in
alabama
shows
that
juries
were
predisposed
to
acquit
white
defendants
of
murdering
black
victims,
or
committing
crimes
against
them,
the
jury's
prejudice
would
tilt
the
scales
in
favor
of
the
white
defendant,
and
that
they
needed
the
judge
override
to
override
life...
arbitrary
recommendations
of
life
in
that
category
of
cases?
they
argue
that
in
their
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
it
correct,
as
justice
scalia
put
it
in
one
of
his
questions,
that
your
basic
position
is
that
if
the
judge
disagrees
with
the
jury
that's
a
sufficient
basis
for
a
different
result?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is...
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent's
view
of
what
the
statistics
would
show
that
if
a
jury
recommends
death,
in
95
percent
of
the
cases
the
judge
will
accept
the
recommendation,
whereas
if
the
jury
recommends
life,
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
cases
in
which
the
judge
will
disagree
and
act
independently,
impose
death?
justice
john
paul
stevens
two
or
three
where
the
judge
has
set
aside
the...
has
imposed
a
life
sentence
on
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
that
number
would
not
be
significant
unless
you
knew
how
often
the
judge
independently
might
have
reached
a
different
conclusion.
i
mean,
you
have
to
have
a
case
in
which
he
said,
well,
i
would
have
imposed
death,
but
given
the
jury's
recommendation
i'll
go
along.
do
you
know
of
any
such
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
system,
can
the
defendant
waive
the
right
to
have
a
jury
advisory
verdict?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
a
defendant
does
that,
is
the
judge's
standard
in
imposing
the
death
sentence
any
different
than
if
there
had
been
an
advisory
verdict
of
life,
namely
that
in
either
event
the
aggravating
must
outweigh
the
litigating?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
appellate
court
give
any
weight
at
all
to
the
judge's
determination
of
the
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
when
it
does
that
review,
does
it
adopt
any
sort
of
presumption
that
the
judge
was
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
starts
from
scratch,
as
though
it
were
the
original
sentencer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
just
merely
say
in
our
opinion
the
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
the
mitigating,
ergo
the
death
sentence
is
proper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
assuming
no
procedural
error,
but
just
on
the
ultimate
determination,
is
it
just
a
totally
de
novo
determination
that
in
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
tribunal
the
aggravating
outweigh
mitigating
and
that's
the
end
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
one
last
question.
you
made
reference
to
this
being
a
compromise
verdict,
and
i
didn't
quite
understand
that,
because
i
thought
the
jury
just
had
two
choices,
either
life
without
parole,
or
death.
