if
a
jury
were
out
of
this
picture
entirely
and
you
just
had
a
judge
with
the
standards
that
the
judge
has
given,
there
would
be
no
constitutional
infirmity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't--
--what
is
the
constitutional
requirement?
you
have
said
that
the
particular
standard
that
florida
uses
that's
been
called
the
tedder
standard,
that
that's
not
constitutionally
required,
but
i
don't
think
you
identified
what
is
the
constitutional
minimum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
the
least?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
friedman--
--but
the
role
that
the
jury
has
here
seems
to
be
a
familiar
one,
and
this
is
not
unknown.
it
is
like
the
advisory
jury
in
equity.
if
you
look
at
federal
rule
39(c),
you'll
see
an
advisory
jury,
that
it's
not
binding
on
the
judge,
that
he
will
consider
or
she
will
consider
for
the
value
he
or
she
thinks
it
has,
so
why
isn't...
and
that's
certainly
compatible
with
the
constitution.
why
should
this
be
regarded
differently?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
more
arbitrary
than
if
the
judge
were
alone
during
the
sentence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
any
indication...
we
don't
have
any
indication
of
how
many
times
the
jury
recommends
life
and
the
judge
leaves
it
alone,
although
he
might
come
in,
if
he
were
left
without
the
jury,
might
have
imposed
a
death
sentence
on
his
own.
we
don't
know,
and
without
knowing
that,
we
really
can't
project,
can
we,
whether
this
system
on
the
whole
favors
defendants,
or
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
did...
the
alabama
supreme
court,
at
least
it
said
this
statute
makes
the
jury
recommendation
advisory
only,
and
courts
have
had
experiences
with
advisory-only
juries,
but
you're
saying
in
the
death
context
an
advisory-only
jury
is
inherently
arbitrary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
sentence
where
the
jury
recommended
life
and
the
jury
left
it
alone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one
aspect
of
this
case
i
wish
you
would
address.
you
have
taken
the
position
very
clearly
that
the
jury
is
advisory
only,
the
judge
gives
it
whatever
credit
she
thinks
it
deserves,
and
yet
this
very
sentencing
judge
that
has
full
responsibility
for
the
sentence
says,
as
far
as
guilt
or
innocence,
that
the
jury
came
in
with
a
guilty
verdict,
the
court
has
no
reason
to
go
behind
the
guilty
verdict
of
the
jury
and
will
not
do
so.
so
the
judge
is
taking
no
responsibility
at
all
for
the
basic
conviction,
and
yet
says,
as
far
as
the
jury
is
concerned
on
sentencing,
there
i'm
not
going
to
give
it
any
credit
because
i
find
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances.
i
can
understand
the
system
that
says,
the
judge
has
to
say
yes,
i
agree
with
the
basic
conviction
and
then
go
on,
but
here,
the
judge
is
saying,
i'm
going
to
leave
it
to
the
jury
on
the
basic
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
have
no
question
about
that,
that
he
has
to
leave
the
jury
verdict
of
guilty
alone.
my
question
is,
can
he
sentence
a
person
to
death
unless
he
is
also
prepared
to
say,
i
would
have
reached
the
same
result
that
the
jury
did
on
guilt?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i'm
speaking
about
his
authority
when
it
comes
to
sentencing.
is
it
rational?
is
it
acceptable
for
a
judge
to
say,
without
committing
myself
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence...
in
other
words,
to
say,
i
might
have
found
this
person
innocent,
yet
i'm
going
to
give
him
the
death
sentence?
