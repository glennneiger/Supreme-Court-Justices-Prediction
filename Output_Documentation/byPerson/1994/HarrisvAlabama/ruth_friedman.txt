ms.
ruth
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
alabama's
capital
sentencing
scheme
provides
fo
two
decision-makers
to
determine
sentence,
a
jury
and
a
judge.
the
legislature
and
the
courts
of
alabama
have
always
said
that
the
jury
has
a
sentencing
role
to
play.
the
alabama
code
addresses
both
jury
and
judge
with
provisions
on
how
to
determine
sentence.
the
legislature
intended
that
"juries
play
a
major
role
in
capital
cases
in
alabama.
"
as
the
alabama
supreme
court
noted
in
its
landmark
decision
in
beck
v.
state.
the
court
confirmed
in
ex
parte
williams
that
tha
role
cannot
count
for
nothing
in
alabama's
system,
where
the
judge
is
the
ultimate
sentencing
authority,
following
the
jury's
completion
of
its
significant
part.
in
johnson
v.
state,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
that
an
alabama
capital
jury
must
be
death
qualified
precisely
because
it
plays
a
"key
role
in
the
sentencing
process.
"
and
despite
the
state's
suggestion
to
the
contrary
in
its
brief,
a
trial
court's
rejection
of
a
jury's
advisory
verdict
is
always
understood
and
referred
to
in
the
case
law
as
an
override
of
that
verdict.
ms.
ruth
friedman
that's
correct,
the
jury
does
not
have
final
authority--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--it
is
like
florida.
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
said
consistently,
actually,
that
alabama
is
virtually
identical
to
florida
in
that
it
is
a
dual
sentencing
state.
it
does
not
have...
the
jury
does
not
have
final
sentencing
authority,
but
it
is
a
constituent
sentencer,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
espinosa
that
in
florida
the
jury
is
a
constituent
sentencer
and
alabama
has
said
that
our
system
is
virtually
identical
to
that.
and
the
alabama
courts
have
said
repeatedly
that
the
jury
verdict
and
the
capital
sentencing
jury
has
a
very
significant
role
to
play,
and
that
can
be
discerned
from
both
the
statutory
provisions
and
the
case
law
in
alabama.
the
statutory
provisions
are
addressed
in
13a-5-46,
for
example,
to
the
capital
sentencing
jury,
on
how
it
is
to
determine
sentence,
and
that
includes
the
weighing
and
consideration
of
aggravation
in
mitigation,
the
returning
of
a
verdict
only
under
certain
circumstances...
that
is,
when
seven,
at
least
7
jurors
vote
that
death
is...
life
is
the
appropriate
punishment,
or
10
that
death
is
the
appropriate
punishment,
and
if
those
numbers
aren't
reached,
a
new
panel
must
be
empaneled
because
that
verdict
would
not
have
been
reached
by
the
first
sentencer.
the
state's
attempt
in
this
case
to
transform
the
life
without
parole
recommendation
of
this
constituent
sentencer
into
a
fact
in
mitigation
is
inconsistent,
thus,
with
the
history
and
the
logic
of
alabama's
capital
sentencing
scheme.
ms.
ruth
friedman
that's
correct.
well,
actually,
one
of
the
defendants,
the
codefendant
in
this
case,
pleaded
guilty
in
exchange
for
his
testimony.
ms.
ruth
friedman
sockwell.
ms.
ruth
friedman
that's
correct.
ms.
ruth
friedman
yes,
it
was.
ms.
ruth
friedman
that's
correct.
ms.
ruth
friedman
that's
correct,
and
it's
impossible
to
tell,
based
on
what
this
judge
did,
why
this
jury
was
rejected,
the
jury's
verdict
was
rejected
in
mrs.
harris'
case.
no
explanation
was
given
in
mrs.
harris'
case
of
why
the
jury's
life
without
parole
verdict
was
not--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--and
that's...
that's
exactly
right,
and
that's
why
mrs.
harris
is
here
today,
because
what
alabama
law
has
done
is,
in
essence,
created
a
dual
sentencing
system,
but
done
nothing
to
regulate
the
relationship
between
the
sentencers.
ms.
ruth
friedman
the
statute
does
not
require
any
more,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
ms.
ruth
friedman
because
this
court's
jurisprudence
under
the
eighth
amendment
has
always
said
that
procedures
by
which
a
death
penalty
is
imposed
must
be
reliable.
in
godfrey
v.
georgia,
for
example,
this
court
said
that
a
state
must
tailor
and
apply
its
law
in
a
manner
that
avoids
arbitrariness.
ms.
ruth
friedman
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
in
alabama,
it
is
pretty
consistent
with
federal
law
to
withdraw
the
jury
from
this
process.
it's
also
pretty
consistent
with
federal
law
to
withdraw
the
judge
from
this
process.
what
it
cannot
do
is
have
two
sentencers,
both
of
whom
are
governed
by
the
eighth
amendment,
and
have
no
connection
whatsoever
between
them.
ms.
ruth
friedman
that's
right.
the
tedder
standard
is
not
itself
constitutionally
required,
but
this
court
has
recognized
it
is
constitutionally
acceptable.
there
are
a
number
of
valid
standards
that
alabama
could
apply.
ms.
ruth
friedman
the
least
standard
might
be
that
the
jury's
verdict
is
rejected
if
there's
some
reasonable
basis
for
rejecting
that,
or
if
no
reasonable
person
could
differ
that
life
was
not
the
appropriate
punishment,
or
another
minimal
basis
could
be
that
the
jury's
verdict
was
itself
considered
a
mitigating
factor,
as
some
of
the
courts
have
done
in
alabama,
because
they
literally
do
not
know
how
to
factor
this
jury
verdict
into
the
sentencing
consideration.
ms.
ruth
friedman
the
jury
is
not
required
under
alabama
law
to
specify
aggravation
in
mitigation,
though
there
is
no
reason
in
this
case--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--justice
scalia,
i
disagree
would
be,
i
weigh
the
aggravation
differently
against
the
mitigation
to
come
up
with
a
different...
a
different
response.
alabama
law
requires
something
else.
ms.
ruth
friedman
but
alabama
law
requires
the
judge
to
do
something
else.
it's
not
just
enough
to
say,
aggravation
outweighs
mitigation,
because
the
statute
requires
something
else.
the
statute
requires
that
somehow
that
jury
verdict
be
factored
into
the
calculus,
be
factored
into
the
process.
ms.
ruth
friedman
and
our
contention
is--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--he...
this
trial
judge
did
say
that
he
considered
the
verdict.
ms.
ruth
friedman
he
clearly
must
have
disagreed
with
it.
ms.
ruth
friedman
because--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--he
said
nothing
about
what
may
have
been
improper
about
this
verdict,
and
when
there
are
two
sentencers,
which
alabama
has
created,
i
consider
it
simply
not
constitutionally
sufficient.
if
this
court...
if
a
trial
judge
had
said
with
regard
to
aggravation
and
mitigation,
i
did
what
i
was
supposed
to
do,
but
didn't
say
what
that
was,
that
wouldn't
be
sufficient,
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
other
contexts
that
simply
saying,
i
did
something,
such
as,
i
found
this
case
to
be
heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel,
is
not
enough
when
that
doesn't
provide
sufficient
guidance
to
the
sentencer
to
make
a
sentencing
decision,
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
ms.
ruth
friedman
because
the
eighth
amendment
requires
some
guided
discretion
of
the
sentencer,
and
here
we
have...
a
second
sentencer
has
to
evaluate
the
judgment
of
the
first
sentencer
and
has
absolutely
no
idea
how
to
take
that
into
consideration,
which
allows
for
arbitrariness,
and
that's
evidenced
by--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--and
if
the
judge
were
alone
during
the
sentence,
justice
ginsburg,
we
wouldn't
have
an
issue
here.
there
would
not
be
a
problem
of
a
disconnection
when
there
is
a
disagreement
between
the
sentencers,
and
alabama
is
free
to
set
up
that
system
if
it
wishes.
this
court
said
in
johnson
v.
mississippi
that
there
is
no
perfect
procedure
by
which
a
state
can
set
up
its
capital
sentencing
scheme,
but
it
cannot
set
up
a
scheme
that's
premised
in
any
way
on
caprice,
and
that's
what
we
have
here,
because
two
sentencers
are
required.
the
jury
verdict...
the
jury
in
this
case
is
very
much
like
a
penalty
phase
jury
in
other
states
where
there
is
no
additional
sentencer,
where
the
judge
is
not
involved.
it
is
death-qualified,
it's
got
to
be
properly
instructed,
it
has
to
hear
only
admissible
evidence
and
then
return
a
verdict
only
under
certain
circumstances,
and
as
i
said,
the
code
provision
is
addressed
to
the
jury.
ms.
ruth
friedman
she's
worse
off
under
the
scheme
that...
yes,
that
alabama
has
created.
ms.
ruth
friedman
but
we
cannot
look,
justice
kennedy,
at
the
scheme
as
if
there
is
no
jury.
ms.
ruth
friedman
i
think
she
would
not
be
worse
off
if
we
just
had
a
jury
involved
in
sentencing
in
alabama
or
if
we
just
had--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
ruth
friedman
because
she
was
sentenced
to
death
under
a
process
that
was
unreliable.
alabama
law
requires
that
that
jury
be
involved
in
the
sentencing
process.
ms.
ruth
friedman
because...
precisely
because
the
advisory
verdict
of
an
alabama
jury
is
not
simply
an
opinion.
an
alabama
law
has
never
treated
it
as
simply
an
opinion,
but
it
has
treated
it
as--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--if
it
was
just
an
opinion,
no.
if
it
was
just
a--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--because
it's
more
of
an
opinion,
justice
kennedy...
because
it's
more
than
an
opinion.
it
is
the
advisory
verdict
of
a
sentencer,
and
you
asked
in
this
case,
is
she
worse
off?
we
have
no
idea
why
the
judge
rejected
the
advisory
verdict
of
life
without
parole
in
this
case,
on
which
there
was
considerable
basis
for
returning
that
verdict.
this
jury
heard
evidence
that
mrs.
harris
was
a
mother
of
seven,
that
she
worked
three
jobs
while
she
was
raising
her
family,
that
she
had
no
prior
criminal
history
whatsoever,
and
that
this...
the
killing
in
this
case
occurred
after
a
history
of
domestic
strife
between
husband
and
wife,
including
incidents
in
which
her
husband
had
hit
mrs.
harris
in
the
head,
threatened
her
with
a
gun,
and
where
there
had
been
a
separation
and
an
application
for
divorce.
under
those
circumstances,
the
jury
was
required
under
alabama
law
to
return
a
considered
verdict,
an
advisory
verdict
of
what
the
appropriate
punishment
was,
and
alabama
law
requires,
the
statute
requires
that
the
judge
do
more
here
than
simply
consider
aggravation
and
mitigation,
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
cases
such
as
espinosa
v.
florida,
or
gardner
v.
florida,
that
when
the
alabama...
excuse
me,
when
a
trial
judge
must
do
more
than
simply
consider
aggravation
and
mitigation,
there
is
another
issue
that
this
court
must
take
into
account
which
can
lead
to
an
arbitrary
sentence
of
death,
which
is
what
happened
in
this
case,
which
is
why
she
is
worse
off.
when
one
looks
at
the
sentencing
orders
returned
in
the
cases
in
alabama,
it
is
impossible
to
have
any
kind
of
consistent
formulation
as
to
how
the
jury
was
made
part
of
the
process.
ms.
ruth
friedman
certainly,
justice
souter.
ms.
ruth
friedman
i
think
there
are
differing
legal
standards.
i
think
there
are
some
judges
who
say--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--i
think
there
are
other
cases
which
are
also
useful
to
look
at.
for
example,
there
are
some
judges
who
say,
i
reject
the
jury's
life-without-parole
verdict,
because
there's
a
reasonable
basis
for
doing
that,
and
there
are
other
judges
who
say,
i
reject
the
jury's
verdict
even
though
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
jury's
verdict.
they're
approaching
it
in
a
completely
different
way,
and
they
also
take
it
into
account
in
a
different
way.
some
do
treat
it
as
a
mitigating
factor,
as
your
honor
suggested.
some
treat
it
in
a
way
that
we
just
don't
even
know.
ms.
ruth
friedman
that's
exactly
right.
ms.
ruth
friedman
yes.
the
first...
except
for
the
first
question
that
you
mentioned
was,
i
follow
it.
in
the
cases
we
have
here,
where
they
haven't
followed
it,
but
i
can
give
you
examples
of
where
those...
there's
a
different
heightened
standard,
that's
exactly
right,
and
if
mrs.
harris
was
sentenced
according
to
one
of
those
standards,
she
might
come
out
with
one
sentence,
and
if
she
was
sentenced
according
to
a
different
one
of
those
standards
in
a
different
courtroom,
she
might
come
out
with
a
different
sentence.
ms.
ruth
friedman
i
think
we're
making
both
of
those
arguments.
ms.
ruth
friedman
it
is
flukish,
justice
scalia,
because
alabama
has
announced
no
standard
to
guide
the
discretion,
that's
exactly
right.
ms.
ruth
friedman
alabama--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--i
think
we
have
a
very
different
system
here,
justice
scalia,
than
just
the
consideration
of
aggravation
and
mitigating
factors.
the...
calling
the
jury
verdict--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--i'm
not
sure
it's
possible
to
say
whether
it
increases
or
decreases.
ms.
ruth
friedman
there's
no
question,
95
percent
of
the
overrides
in
the
state
are
life-without-parole
verdicts
of
a
jury
overridden
to
death.
ms.
ruth
friedman
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
stevens.
ms.
ruth
friedman
we
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
i
don't
think
we
can
talk
about
whether
the
system
favors
defendants
when
the
system
has
a
built-in
arbitrary
aspect
to
it.
ms.
ruth
friedman
it's...
not
necessarily.
it's
inherently
arbitrary
under
alabama's
system
because
of
what
alabama
has
created.
it
has
created
a
constituent
sentencer
by
all
of
the
case
law
and
all
of
the
provisions
that
are
addressed
to
that
first
sentencer.
certainly
the
eighth
amendment
requires
something
different
from
what
may
be
required
in
other
contexts
where
some
advisory
judgment
is
made,
but
certainly
there
are
other
contexts
in
the
law
as
well,
where
a
second
decisionmaker
is
asked...
is
given
some
rule
or
regulation
for
knowing
how
to
take
that
first
decisionmaker's
judgment
into
account.
ms.
ruth
friedman
i'm
afraid
i
don't
know
the
rule
in
equity
court,
justice--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
ms.
ruth
friedman
we
raised
a
fourteenth
amendment
and
an
eighth
amendment
claim,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
ms.
ruth
friedman
we
did
not
rely
specifically
on
the
equal
protection
clause.
ms.
ruth
friedman
i
don't
know
that
we
have
to
separate--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--perhaps
i
understood
exactly
what
question
i
was
being
asked.
i
think
the
analysis
is
the
same,
that...
and
really
the
most
direct
analysis
i
think
is
under
the
eighth
amendment
arbitrariness
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
which
is
that
capital
defendants
in
alabama
are
being
subjected
to
an
arbitrariness
process,
and
are
being
treated
inconsistently
because
of
that
arbitrary
process,
and
that,
i
think,
is
the
basis
for
decisionmaking
here.
because
alabama
has
created
a
dual
sentencing
system,
that
is
why
the
advisory
verdict
rises
to
a
certain
level.
it
is
true
that,
as
justice
ginsburg
mentioned
before,
that
the
statute
itself
says
this
advisory
verdict
is
an
advisory
verdict,
it
is
a
recommendation,
it
isn't
binding,
but
because
alabama
has
created
a
second
sentencer,
that
second
sentencer
is
also
subject
to
the
eighth
amendment,
and
because
of
that,
alabama
has
left
a
piece
out
of
regulating
the
relationship.
we
are
not
saying
that
alabama
need
make
that
advisory
verdict
binding
on
the
trial
court,
but
what
it
need
do
is
regulate
the
relationship
between
the
sentencers.
when
there
is
a
disagreement
between
the
sentencers,
that
second
sentencer
has
no
idea
how
to
factor
it
in,
and
the
problem
that
arises,
as
can
be
seen
in
the
different
orders
of
the
trial
courts,
is
that
without
some
standard,
without
some
guidance
from
the
alabama
supreme
court,
they
just
don't
even
know
what
it
is.
they
don't
know
how
to
make
it
part
of
the
process
at
all,
and
therefore
some
treat
it
as
a
mitigating
factor,
some
treat
it
as
a
prior
judgment,
some
try
and
weigh
it
into
the
balance,
even
though
they're
not
treating
it
as
a
mitigating
factor,
and
some
have
a
variety
of
legal
standards
under
which
to
reject
or
accept
that
verdict.
that
is
an
inconsistent
and
arbitrary
process.
ms.
ruth
friedman
it
is
insufficient,
and
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
what
the
alabama
supreme
court
does
in
its
discussion
of
reweighing
is
never
addressed,
what
the
jury's
role
was
in
the
process,
and
that's
certainly
what
happened
in
mrs.
harris'
case,
and
secondly,
alabama
does
not
reweigh
aggravation
and
mitigation
in
the
way
that
this
court
has
understood
that
term
in
cases
such
as
clemons.
it
has
said
specifically
in
longhorn
v.
state
that
it
does
not
reweigh,
and
if
there
are
errors
below,
that
sentence
is
sent
back
to
the
trial
court
for
the
trial
court
to
impose
sentence.
ms.
ruth
friedman
and
that's
true
for
the
intermediate
appellate
court
as
well,
justice
kennedy.
the
language
of
the
statute
is,
we
do
an
independent
reweighing,
and
that
language
certainly
goes
to
the
appellate
court's
review,
which
also
involves
proportionality.
but
what
it
does
not
do
is
address
part
of
the
process
that
happened
below,
which
is,
because
the
judge
was
required
to
do
more
than
consider
aggravation
and
mitigation,
but
also
to
make
that
jury
verdict
a
part
of
the
process,
which
is
mandated
by
statute,
the
appellate
review
is
insufficient
because
it
does
not
review
what
actually
happened
below.
and
as
to
reweighing,
the
alabama
appellate
courts
do
not
do
that
in
the
traditional
way
that
this
court
understands
reweighing
to
take
place.
and
as
i
mentioned
before,
in
cases
such
as
espinosa,
or
in
cases
such
as
gardner
v.
florida,
the
fact
that
aggravation
is
found
to
outweigh
mitigation
does
not
address
an
arbitrary
element
in
the
process,
and
that's
what
we
have
here,
with
the
disconnection
between
the
two
sentencers.
this
court
has
said,
in
cases
going
as
far
back
as
gregg,
that
the
eighth
amendment
limits
the
discretion
of
the
sentencers
to
minimize
the
risk
of
arbitrary
action,
and
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
arbitrary
action.
because
alabama
has
required
that
two
sentencers
be
involved
in
this
process,
it
creates,
without
some
connection
between
them,
the
risk
of
arbitrariness
because
there
is
no
standard
for
that
second
sentencer
to--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--certainly
the
judge
can
form
that...
can
provide
that
role
if
the
alabama
supreme
court
were
to
announce
such
a
standard
as
racial
prejudice,
if
there
was
some
evidence
or
suggestion
of
racial
prejudice,
or
some
other
kind
of
improper
action
on
the
part
of
the
jury,
but
that
has
not
happened.
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
announced
no
such
standard,
and
there
is
certainly
no
evidence
or
suggestion
in
this
case
that
there's
any
such
impropriety
in
the
forming
of
the
jury
verdict
here.
it
is
very
critical
for
this
court
to
understand
that
alabama
has
created
a
dual
sentencing
scheme,
and
the
role
of
that
jury,
while
it
is
not
binding,
while
it
is
advisory,
is
just
like
the
penalty
phase
juries
in
other
states
in
which
there
is
no
final,
ultimate
authority
by
a
judge.
therefore,
because
it
has--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--it
could
be
a
legitimate
object.
ms.
ruth
friedman
it
absolutely
could
be
a
legitimate
object.
ms.
ruth
friedman
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
exactly
where
your
honor's
going.
ms.
ruth
friedman
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
there
could
be
a
standard,
clearly,
where
if
there
was--
ms.
ruth
friedman
--well,
i
use
that
language
because
it
was
language
in
tedder.
there
can
also
be
a
more
minimal
standard.
ms.
ruth
friedman
that
could
be
a
standard
as
well.
that
could
certainly
be
a
standard.
there's
also
no
evidence
that
in
any
case...
you
know,
hays
was
one
case
which
a
standard
that
was
set
out
in
the
alabama
system,
were
alabama
to
announce
one,
that
hays
could
certainly
meet.
there
is
no
evidence
that
that
standard
applies
to
any
other
case,
and
particularly
mrs.
harris'
case,
where
there
is
no
evidence
of
racial
prejudice
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
the
jury,
and
there's
no
reasonable
basis
evident
in
this
record
to
determine
why
that
jury's
life-without-parole
verdict
wasn't
reasonable,
and
why
it
was
rejected
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
ruth
friedman
thank
you.
ms.
ruth
friedman
to
respond
to
the
earlier
questions
about
appellate
review,
the
alabama
supreme
court
does
not
see
itself
as
having
the
authority
to
impose
a
sentence
de
novo,
or
to
do
that
kind
of
reweighing
analysis
whenever
independent
of
some
kind
on
error
below.
if
there
is
an
error
below,
the
appellate
court
always
sends
the
case
back,
so
it
is
not
a
de
novo
sentencing
that
the
alabama
courts
have
ever
seen
themselves
authorized
to
perform.
ms.
ruth
friedman
it's
not
a
de
novo
review
of
the
evidence
below.
if
there
is
some
kind
of
error
below,
the
appellate
courts
in
alabama
do
not
see
themselves
as
authorized
to
fix
that.
what
they
do
is,
they
send
the
case
back
if
there
is
some
problem
below.
to
address
also
justice
o'connor's
point
earlier
about
the
coral
case
and
the
treatment
regarding
how
much
weight
was
given
to
the
jury
life-without-parole
verdict,
the
same
judge
not
only
gave
it
different
weight,
but
treated
it
as
a
mitigating
factor
in
one
case
and
not
a
mitigating
factor
in
another.
so
that
question
of,
from
county
to
county,
it's
so
irregular
that
even
the
same
judge
is
treating
the
verdict
in
a
different
way,
and
i
think
one
thing
we
can
tell,
certainly
from
the
practice
in
history
of
override
in
alabama,
is
that
alabama
defendants
certainly
are
not
benefiting
from
it.
95
percent
of
those
overrides
are
jury
life-without-parole
verdicts
overridden
into
death
verdicts.
what
alabama
has
is
an
otherwise
constitutional
process
that
is
operating
in
an
arbitrary
manner,
and
all
the
alabama
court
needs
to
do
is
state
a
rule
and
fix
that
arbitrary
problem.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
