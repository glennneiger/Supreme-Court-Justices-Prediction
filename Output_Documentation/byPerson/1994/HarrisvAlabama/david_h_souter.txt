justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
that
a
different
argument?
i
mean,
you've
been
arguing
about
the
unreliability
of
what
happened
in
this
case
and
can
happen
in
other
cases,
but
are
you
also
making
the
argument
that
in
fact
different
trial
judges
are
applying
different
standards
in
evaluating
what
the
jury's
verdict
actually
is?
not
merely
that
some
happen
to
give
great
weight
in
a
given
case
and
others
happen
to
give
little
weight,
but
that
there
are
different
legal
standards
that
they
are
bringing
to
bear
in
deciding
what
to
do
with
a
jury
verdict?
is
that
also
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
went
back,
and
here's
where
i
want
you
to
help
me
out.
i
went
back
through,
admittedly
somewhat
quickly
this
morning,
but
i
went
back
through
the
examples
that
you
gave
in
your
brief,
and
i
found
examples
in
which
some
trial
judges
are
saying
that
they
consider
the
jury's
recommendation
as
a
mitigating
circumstance.
i
found
some
in
which
they
simply
don't
say
that...
they
don't
say
that
they
don't
consider
it
a
mitigating
circumstance.
they
just
don't
describe
it...
and
i
found
a
third
category
in
which
judges,
whether
they
call
it
a
mitigating
circumstance
or
not,
in
fact
have
said
that
they
gave
great
weight
to
the
jury
verdict.
do
those
three
examples
ground
an
inference
that
there
are
different
legal
standards
being
used
in
the
importance
given
to
the
verdict
as
distinct
from
simply
different
treatments,
depending
on
what
in
individual
cases
judges
happen
to
think
the
value
of
the
jury
recommendation
is?
is
there
a...
as
they
say
today,
is
there
a
systemic
difference
based
on
legal
standards,
or
are
there
just
varieties
of
applications
which
vary
according
to
the
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
can
you
infer
that
from
the
examples
that
i
gave,
or
am
i
missing
something?
is
there
something
more
in
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
it
doesn't
follow
from
the
latter
instance
that
they're
not
giving
it
the
same
weight
they
would
give
it
if
they
called
it
a
mitigating
circumstance.
i
don't
think
we
can
infer
much
from
that.
but
you
say
there
are
examples
in
which
some
judges
say,
i
follow
it
because
it
is
reasonable,
implying...
because
there's
a
reasonable
basis
for
it,
implying
that
there
would
be
a
sort
of
heightened
standard
of
persuasion
to
reject
it,
whereas
others
say,
although
it
is
reasonable
i
reject
it
without
indicating
that
there
is
any
heightened
standard
for
rejection,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
you
give
me...
and
you
don't
necessarily
have
to
do
it
this
moment,
but
you
could
do
it
after
argument.
could
you
give
me
two
cases
illustrating
those
two
approaches?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
really
making
kind
of
an
equal
protection
argument
based
on
disparate
legal
standards,
rather
than
simply
a
variety
of
treatment.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
rule
in
an
equity
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
know
whether
there
is
a
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me.
do
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
to
be
that
yes,
that
probably
was
the
object
of
this
scheme,
and
that
it's
a
legitimate
object--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
simply
came
down
in
the
wrong
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
on
your...
going
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
in
which
you
thought
one
standard
might
be
that
the
judge
could
not
override
unless
no
reasonable
jury
could
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
trial
jury
did,
you
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
the
judge
to
perform
that
function.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you...
you
accept
the
legitimacy,
i
guess,
of
the
state's
argument
that
one
of
the
justifications
for
this
scheme
is
that
there
tends
to
be
a
racial
prejudice
in
favor
of
white
defendants,
and
i
go
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
first
question
in
which
she
said,
well,
what
might
the
standard
be?
one
of
the
examples,
as
i
recall,
that
you
gave
was
the
standard
that
the
judge
could
only
override
if
he
found
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
have
concluded
as
this
jury
did,
so
what
i'm
saying
is,
i
guess
it
follows
on
your
theory
that
it
would
be
more
difficult
on
your...
on
a
scheme
that
would
be
acceptable
to
you
for
the
judge
to
perform
this
kind
of
function
of
eliminating
the
racial
bias
in
the
sentencing
juries.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
pretty
tough
to
meet
a
standard
that
requires
a
finding
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
have
concluded
as
they
did.
that's
a
high
standard.
that's
higher
than
tedder.
justice
david
h.
souter
tedder
required
just
clear
and
convincing
demonstration.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
there
a
distinction
between
the
discretion
to
give
weight
according
to
what
the
evidence
warrants
in
a
given
case
on
the
one
hand,
and
discretion
to
consider
an
aspect
of
the
process
as
either
of
no
value
or
of
great
value?
and
i
thought
the
implication
of
the
way
justice
kennedy
phrased
his
question
was
that
the...
there
was
a
difference
not
specific
to
cases,
but
a
difference
which
amounted
to
a
different
legal
standard
in
the
manner
in
which
the
judges
from
county
to
county
were
evaluating
the
fact,
we'll
call
it,
of
the
jury
recommendation.
the
first
kind
of
discretion
to
take
evidence
for
what
it's
worth
is
undoubted.
the
second
kind
of
discretion
is
different.
why
doesn't
that
raise
a
problem
either
of
equal
protection,
or
of
arbitrariness,
or
of
arbitrary
variation
in
sentencing?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
grant
you
it
doesn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
i'd
like
to
know
what
you
would
say.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
make
it
clearer,
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
county
1,
the
judge
says,
i
always
accept
a
jury's
recommendation
unless
no
reasonable
jury
could
have
come
to
that
conclusion.
in
county
2,
the
judge
says,
i
never
accept
a
jury's
recommendation
as
carrying
any
more
weight
than
in
fact
i
think
it's
worth,
based
on
the
individual
circumstances
of
the
case.
assuming
you
have
that
kind
of
a
variation,
a)
do
you
have
an
eighth
amendment
problem,
b)
if
it
were
before
us,
would
you
have
an
equal
protection
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
you're
changing
my
hypo.
either
that,
or
i'm
not
making
my
hypo
clear.
in
the
first
case,
in
county
a
the
judge
says,
my
legal
standard
is,
i
always
accept
the
recommendation
unless
i
conclude
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
have
concluded
as
this
one
did.
in
county
b
the
judge
says,
i
accept
it
or
reject
it,
depending
on
the
weight
that
i
think
it's
worth.
i
don't
have
in
effect
any
override
standard
at
all.
now,
those
are
two
different
legal
standards.
is
there
an
eighth
amendment
problem
or
an
equal
protection
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
shouldn't
we
consider
the
same
disparity
under
our
nonarbitrariness
jurisprudence
under
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
am.
it's
working
on
different
legal
standards
in
different
counties.
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
that
infect
the
validity
of
the
standard,
of
the
process
under
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
my...
stick
to
my
hypo.
my
hypo
does
involve
two
different
legal
standards.
eighth
amendment
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
there
are
two...
again,
there
are
two
discretions
involved.
assume...
assume,
just
to
keep
it
simple,
a
hypothetical
case
in
which
two
judges
are
sitting
on
the
same
case.
a
jury
recommendation
comes
in.
each
judge
says,
i
really
do
not
have
very
much
confidence
in
this
jury,
for
various
reasons.
i
don't
think
the
jury's
qualifications
are
all
that
great,
and
so
if
i'm
going
to
weigh
this
for
what
it's
worth,
i'm
going
to
give
it
much
less
weight
than
i
would
normally
give
a
jury
recommendation.
one
of
those
judges,
however,
says,
i
believe
that
that
is
binding
on
me
unless
there
is
clear
and
convincing
evidence
or
evidence
rising
to
the
demonstration
of
irrationality
that
the
jury's
verdict
is
wrong.
the
other
one
says,
i'm
just
going
to
take
it
for
what
it's
worth.
those
two
judges
are
going
to
come
to
different
conclusions
in
following
the
jury's
verdict,
are
they
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
discretion
about
how
much
weight
to
give
the
jury's
verdict
is
inherent
in
the
function
of
weighing
evidence,
but
the
discretion
of...
i'm
sorry,
i'm
putting
it
badly.
the
discretion
to
determine
the
sort
of
value
in
the
abstract
of
what
the
jury's
recommendations
were
is
sort
of
inherent
in
the
indiscretion
to
consider
evidence,
but
the
discretion
to
override
or
not
depends
upon
a
legal
standard,
and
in
my
hypo,
there
were
two
different
legal
standards,
and
i
take
it,
as
you
conceded
earlier,
that
would
rise,
if
there
were
such
a
disparity...
one
county
has
a
judge
taking
the
one
position,
one
county
has
a
different
one...
that
would
rise
to
the
level
of
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
do...
is
there
not
at
least
an
obligation
for
the
state
to
say,
you
should
not,
judges,
give
this
a
kind
of
prima
facie
weight
simply
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it's
a
jury
recommendation?
you
should
never
give
it
any
weight
beyond
what
you
think
it's
worth
in
the
abstract?
isn't
a
capital
defendant
at
least
entitled
to
that
degree
of
illumination?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right,
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
the
eighth
amendment
doesn't
require
that,
then
the
door
is
open
for
the
imposition
not
merely
of
different
weights
to
give
a
verdict,
but
different
standards
for
judging
what
the
verdict
of
a
given
weight
is
worth,
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
so?
the
door
is
open
to
that,
if
the
alabama
supreme
court
gives
no
guidance
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
you
tell
me...
i
just
don't...
i
should
know
this,
and
i
don't.
did
the
petitioner
in
this
case
ask
the
judge
to
adopt
a
specific
ruling
of
law
which
would
state
or
articulate
the
weight
that
was
going
to
be
given
by
him
to
the
jury
verdict?
justice
david
h.
souter
as
if
it
were
the
jury?
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
give
the
jury
recommendation
any
weight
one
way
or
the
other,
either?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
it
place...
i
take
it,
it
places
itself
in
effect
in
the
position
of
the
jury
but
not
the
position
of
the
judge?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
can't
be
right,
because
it
considers
the
presentence
report,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
does
the
appellate...
the
appellate
court
then
considers
the
jury
verdict
in
some
sense.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
does
not
articulate
the
standard
it
uses
to
determine
whether
any
particular
prima
facie
weight
is
to
be
given
to
the
jury
recommendation,
or
whether
no
prima
facie
weight
should
be
given.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
does
it
do
with
the
presentence
report?
doesn't
it
consider
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
that's
more
than
just
reweighing.
in
other
words,
it
goes
through
a
sentencing
process
that
goes
beyond
reweighing
what
the
jury
weighed.
