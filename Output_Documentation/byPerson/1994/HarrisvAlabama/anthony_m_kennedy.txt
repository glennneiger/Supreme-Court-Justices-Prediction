justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
can
you
tell
me,
for
the
four
defendants
were
there
four
different
juries?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
in
the
jury...
was
it
sockwell--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--was
the
trigger
man?
that
jury
also
recommended
life?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
the
division
there,
was
it
7
to
5
as
well?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
a
different
jury
than
harris'
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
your
client
somehow
worse
off
because
a
jury
made
a
recommendation
of
life?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i.e.,
worse
off
than
if
there
had
been
no
jury
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we
look
at
just
that,
because
justice
ginsburg
was
asking
you
what
if
there
were
just
a
judge
sitting,
and
so
my
question
is,
is
your
client
really
worse
off
than
if
there
were
no
jury
at
all?
here's
a
jury
who
tells
a
judge,
7
to
5,
we
think
it
should
be
life.
how
is
she
worse
off
than
if
there'd
been
no
jury
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
that's
not
my
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
question
is,
why
is
she
worse
off
under
the
present
system?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
less
reliable
if
a
judge
has
an
opinion
to
take
into
account?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
assume
that
that's
what
you're
complaining
about.
let's
say
it
was
just
an
opinion.
is
your
client
any
worse
off?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
how
is
she
any
worse
off
under
this
procedure,
where
it's
even
more
than
an
opinion?
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
even
more
protection
for
her.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
assume
that
that's
true,
then
reweighing
by
the
alabama
appellate
court
is
insufficient?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
referring
to
the
intermediate
appellate
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
could
you
tell
us
in
that
period
where
you
had
26
overrides,
how
many
cases,
capital
cases
were
there...
potential
capital
cases
were
there
in
which
there
was
no
override?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it
were
shown
in
this
case
that
in
county
number
1
a
judge
says,
i
accept
the
advisory
verdict
unless
there's
a
reasonable
grounds
for
upsetting
it.
county
number
2,
the
judge
said,
i
give
very
little
weight
to
what
the
advisory
jury
says,
and
similar
disparate
approaches
in
various
other
counties.
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
in
answer
to
a
series
of
questions
that
justice
souter
and
i
were
posing
that
you
said
that
if
there
were
different
prevailing
practices
in
different
counties,
on
just
this
sort
of
legal
issue,
there
would
be
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
haven't
we
come
now
from
the
hypothesis
to
reality,
based
on
your
answers
to
judge
breyer's
questions,
justice
breyer's
questions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
i'm
not
sure
why
you
concede
that
there
would
be
an
eighth
amendment
violation,
under
our
earlier
hypothesis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
law
in
effect
says
a
judge
can
do
what
you
say
the
law...
what
the
judges
in
reality
do,
what
difference
does
it
make?
why
is
there
equal
protection...
or
an
eighth
amendment
violation
in
one
case
and
not
the
other?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
thee
were
an
eighth
amendment
violation
of
the
sort
that
we've
been
discussing,
would
it
be
cured
by
the
independent
reweighing
that
the
appellate
court
did
at
page
101
of
the
transcript?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
it
says
at
page
101
that
after
an
independent
weighing,
we
find
that
it's
the
proper
sentence.
