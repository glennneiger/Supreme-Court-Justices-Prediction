why...
what
about
just
disagreeing
with
the
jury?
i
mean,
i
could
understand
the
need
for
a
reasoned
rejection
of
the
jury
verdict
if
the
jury
verdict
itself
were
a
reasoned
verdict.
was
it?
did
the
jury
give
reasons
why
it
thought
that
the
death
sentence
should
not
be
imposed?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
just
comes
in
and
says,
we
recommend
life?
what
could
the
judge
possibly
say
to
explain
his
disagreement
except
to
say,
i
disagree?
not
knowing
the
reasons
the
jury
said
that,
how
can
you
explain
the
reason
for
your
rejecting?
his
reason
is,
i
see
it
differently.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
he
say
that
implicitly
simply
by
saying,
in
my
view
the
death
penalty
is
the
right
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
doesn't
require...
it
requires
that
he
consider
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
did.
did
he
consider
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
disagreed
with
it,
evidently.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
more
could
be
possibly
have
said--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
show
why
he
disagreed
with
it,
since
he
didn't
know
the
basis
on
which
it
was...
itself
was
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
you're
making
a
sort
of
furman
argument
that
sentencing
shouldn't
be
flukish,
and
that
it's
flukish
unless
all
of
the
judges
are
treating
the
jury's
recommendation
the
same
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
same
flukishness
occurs
whenever
you
allow
a
jury
or
a
judge
sentencer
to
take
account
of
mitigating
circumstances.
i
mean,
haven't
we
gone
down
that
road
in
lockett,
and
isn't,
in
effect,
allowing
the
judge
to
have
a
jury
recommendation
which
may
say,
you
know,
in
our
view
you
should
let
this
person
get
off
without
the
death
sentence,
isn't
that
simply
the
addition
of
an
additional
mitigating
factor
which,
to
be
sure,
provides
for
more
flukishness,
but
always
to
the
benefit
of
the
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
would
say
in
lockett
that
that's
not
only
okay,
but
it's
required,
at
least...
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
even
without
those,
i
don't
suppose
it's
irrational
to
say,
you
know,
i'm
not
sure
who
did
this,
but
whoever
did
it
deserves
the
death
penalty.
this
was
a
horrible,
heinous
crime.
i
could
conceive
that,
and
if
the
judge
says
it's
really
not
my...
not
my
role
in
this
state
system
to
decide
who
did
it,
but
i
do
know
that
whoever
did
it
deserves
the
death
penalty,
the
jury
having
found
that
this
person
did
it,
this
person
deserves
the
death
penalty.
there's
nothing
irrational
about
that,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
happens
all
the
time,
even
with
a
finding
of
guilt,
but
i
suppose
one
jury
might
consider
that
certain
facts
justify
a
particular
inference,
whereas
another
jury
would
conclude
that
those
same
facts
don't
justify
another
inference,
and
i
suppose
you'd
have
an
unjust
system
if
the
law
required
in
different
counties
those
divergent
findings,
but
not
if
a
jury
vested
with
discretion
happens
to
reach
them,
and
that's
what
you
say
is
the
situation
here,
that
you
may
indeed
have
divergences
with
different
judges,
but
they
are
not
divergences
required
by
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
judge
can
presumably
give
greater
degrees
of
discretion
to
some
juries
than
to
others.
he
may
trust
one
jury
more
than
another.
can
he
take
that
into
account?
justice
antonin
scalia
having
sat
with
this
jury
for
a
certain
amount
of
time,
he
may
have
some
views
as
to
how
good
the
jury
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
rule
would
eliminate
that
degree
of
discretion,
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
if
you
said--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
any
legal
standard.
there's
no
basis
for
any
judge
considering
himself
bound
by
any
legal
standard,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
to
consider
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
if
a
case
is
tried
to
a
judge
instead
of
to
a
jury
on
the
guilt
phase,
a
judge...
one
judge
could
say,
you
know,
i
consider
this
factor
crucial,
and
another
judge
could
say,
i
consider
this
factor
of
no
significance,
and
that
wouldn't
render
the
state's
system
arbitrary
or
unconstitutional,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
i'm
not
sure
if--
--it's
apparently
the
conferral
of
discretion
on
the
fact-finder.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
do
not
concede
that
merely
the
perception
of
different
legal
standards
is
enough
to
render
it
unconstitutional,
or
do
you
concede
that?
