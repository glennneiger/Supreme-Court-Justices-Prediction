chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-7659,
louise
harris
v.
alabama.
ms.
friedman,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
certainly
isn't
technically
correct,
is
it?
i
mean,
because
no
one
claimed
the
jury
has
final
authority
in
the
event
the
judge
didn't
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
not
like
florida.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
that's
consistent
with
alabama
law.
the
alabama
courts
have
never
required
an
explanation
from
the
judge
as
to
why
he
rejected
the
jury's
verdict.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
call
it
a
dual
sentencing
system,
but
the
statute
says,
while
the
jury's
recommendation
concerning
sentence
shall
be
given
consideration,
it
is
not
binding
upon
the
court.
here,
the
trial
judge
recited
that
he
had
considered
the
jury's
recommendation.
surely
the
statute
doesn't
require
any
more.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
thinking
the
constitution
requires
any
more?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
friedman,
did
you
raise
your
equal
protection
claim
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
was
that
just
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
incorporated
the
eighth
amendment,
or
was
it
in
so
many
words
a
reliance
on
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
you
can't
raise
an
equal
protection
clause
here,
claim
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
answered
justice
souter's
question,
i
thought,
that
you
were
raising
an
equal
protection
claim
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
friedman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bjurberg,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
that
alabama
law,
that
a
judge
could
not
set
aside
a
jury
verdict
on
a
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
unless
the
motion...
or
unless
there
were
sufficient
to
grant
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
or
a
judgment
of
acquittal
under
a
traditional
standard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
indication
in
this
case
that
the
sentencing
judge
gave
any
prima
facie
weight
beyond
just
considering
it
to
this
jury's
verdict?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bjurberg.
ms.
friedman,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
does
say,
after
an
independent
weighing
of
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
you
say
that's
not
an
independent
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
friedman.
the
case
is
submitted.
