mr.
dreeben,
can
you...
you
gave
us
one
example
of
a
prosecution
in
which
an
element
would
be...
an
element
of
the
crime
would
be
found
by
the
judge,
other
than
this
one,
and
that
was
whether
particular
land
is
within
the
territory
of
the
united
states.
do
you
have
any
other
examples?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it
would
really
help
me
a
lot
to
know
that
this
is
a
common
occurrence.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
prosecution
under
section
1984
for
depriving
someone
of
civil
rights,
a
conspiracy
to
deprive
someone
of
civil
rights,
and
the
deprivation
is
that
two
law
enforcement
officers
conspire
to
conduct
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
who
would
determine
whether
it
was
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
that's
because
you
never
let
it
go
to
the
jury.

this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent
michael
gaudin,
a
real
estate
broker
and
developer
made
numerous
false
statements
on
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
loan
documents.
he
was
convicted
of
violating
18
u.s.c.
section
1001,
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
make
false
statements
to
the
government.
at
his
trial
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
the
government
had
to
prove
that
the
false
statements
made
by
respondent
were
material,
that
is,
that
they
had
a
natural
tendency
to
influence
or
were
capable
of
influencing
hud’s
decision
to
ensure
the
loans,
but,
the
judge
also
instructed
the
jury
that
it
was
for
the
court
and
not
for
the
jury
to
decide
that
question
of
whether
the
false
statements
were
material,
and
he
instructed
them
that
they
were.
on
appeal,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
trial
judge’s
refusal
to
submit
the
question
of
materiality
to
the
jury
violated
respondent’s
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights.
in
the
unanimous
opinion
today
we
affirm
that
decision.
we
have
repeatedly
held
that
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
guarantee
a
criminal
defendant,
the
right
to
have
a
jury
determine
his
guilt
or
innocence
on
every
element
of
the
crime
with
which
he
is
charged.
this
right
has
an
impressive
pedigree.
blackstone
for
example,
described
“trial
by
jury”
as
requiring
that
quote
“the
truth
of
every
accusation
should
afterwards
be
confirmed
by
the
unanimous
suffrage
of
twelve
of
[the
defendant's]
equals
and
neighbors.”
justice
story
wrote
that
the
“trial
by
jury”
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
is
“generally
understood
to
mean…
a
trial
by
a
jury
of
12
men,
who
must
unanimously
concur
in
the
guilt
of
the
accused
before
a
legal
conviction
can
be
had.”
in
this
case,
the
government
conceded
materiality
as
an
element
of
guilt,
that
is,
an
element
of
the
offense
of
violating
1001
and
accordingly,
it
would
seem
that
respondent
had
a
right
to
have
the
jury
not
the
judge
to
decide
materiality.
the
government
offers
essentially
three
arguments
in
response
to
this
logic,
the
first
is
that
the
jury
need
not
decide
materiality
because
it
is
a
purely
legal
question
and
that
the
principle
requiring
the
jury
to
decide
all
of
the
client’s
elements
actually
applies
only
to
those
essential
elements
factual
components.
that
position
we
find
has
no
support
in
the
case
law.
indeed
our
1895
decision
in
spar!
v.
united
states
as
well
as
the
more
modern
authorities
on
which
the
government
relies
all
confirm
that
the
jury’s
constitutional
responsibility
is
not
merely
to
determine
the
facts
but
to
apply
the
law
to
those
facts
and
draw
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
government’s
next
argument
is
that
even
if
the
jury
generally
must
pass
on
all
of
the
elements,
there
is
an
exception
for
materiality
determinations
with
respect
to
false
statements
in
perjury
prosecutions
(which
are
analogous
to
the
determinations
made
in
section
1001
prosecutions).
contrary
to
the
government’s
argument
however
there
is
no
consistent
historical
tradition
supporting
this
position,
it
was
not
until
a
120
years
after
the
adoption
of
the
bill
of
rights,
that
the
rule
the
government
with
spouses
was
finally
adopted
in
england
not
by
judicial
decision
but
by
parliament,
and
more
importantly
there
was
also
no
clear
practice
in
this
country
at
or
near
the
time
the
bill
of
rights
was
adopted.
state
in
federal
cases
appear
not
to
have
addressed
the
question
until
the
latter
part
of
the
19th
century,
at
which
time
they
did
not
display
anything
like
the
virtual
unanimity
claimed
by
the
government.
although,
a
uniform
postratification
practice
can
assuredly
shed
light
upon
the
meaning
of
an
ambiguous
constitutional
provision,
the
practice
here
is
not
uniform,
and
the
core
meaning
of
the
constitutional
guarantees
is
not
ambiguous.
finally,
the
government
argues
that
stare
decisis
requires
that
respondent's
constitutional
claim
be
denied.
the
government
relies
on
sinclair
v.
united
states,
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
materiality
element
in
a
statute
criminalizing
the
making
of
false
statements
in
a
matter
under
congressional
investigation
was
a
question
of
law
for
the
judge,
we
overrule
that
case
today.
the
decision
manifestly
erroneous,
and
the
doctrine
of
the
stare
decisis
has
a
little
force
with
respect
to
this
president
which
involves
a
procedural
rule
resting
on
an
interpretation
of
the
constitution,
the
underpinnings
of
which
have
been
eroded
by
subsequent
decisions.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed.
our
opinion
as
i
said
is
unanimous.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
in
which
justices
o’connor
and
breyer
have
joined.
