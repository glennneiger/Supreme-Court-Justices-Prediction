justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that's
an
argument
against
the
jury
system.
it's
not
an
argument
against
submitting
this
issue,
is
it?
i
mean,
that...
what
you
say
there,
to
the
extent
that
it's
true,
it
could
be
true
of
any
issue
that
gets
submitted
to
a
jury.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
cannot
inform
our
answer,
because
that
would
simply
involve
us
in
total
circularity.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
but
if
we
do
that,
it
seems
to
me
we
could
say,
well,
when
the
materiality
issue
is
simply
a
strictly
relational
issue,
if
it's
strictly
an
issue
of
relevance,
okay,
there's
a
good
common
law
antecedent
for
saying
it
is
a
question
of
law
and
nothing
but
that.
but
on
the
basis
of
your
own
answer
to,
first
to
justice
o'connor
and
then
i
thought
to
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
you're
saying
there's
more
to
it
than
that,
because
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
possibilities
consistent
with
your
answer.
one
is
that
we
are
looking
to
what
you
called
policies,
which
in
fact
are
i
guess
statements
of
how
the
agency
does,
in
fact,
treat
certain
factual
material
that
may
come
before
it,
or
a
second
possibility
might
be
that
we
look
to
the
statutes
and
we
look
to
the
relevant
facts,
and
we
ask,
in
effect,
what
would
a
reasonable
official
with
these
responsibilities
do
with
these
kinds
of
facts,
which
gets
us
into
the
category
that
you
mentioned
of
kind
of
the
classic
reasonable
person
tort
law
concept.
in
either
case,
whether
we're
looking
for
the
actual
policy
or
the
policy
that
a
reasonable
person
would
follow,
we're
doing
something
more
than
simply
asking
a
question
of
the
relevance
of
one
proposition
to
another
proposition.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
then
leaves
you
with,
i
suppose,
the
reasonable
official,
given
the
responsibilities
that
the
law
imposes.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't
that,
therefore,
get
you
right
into
the
analogy
with
tort
law,
reasonable
person
questions,
or
classic
jury
questions?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
legal
fact
that
is
one
of
the
facts
that
would
inform
the
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
right.
does
that
take
you
to
the
point
of
saying
that
whenever
the
question
is,
as
you've
said
to
justice
o'connor,
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
that
it
must
always
be
reserved
by
the...
or
may
constitutionally
always
be
reserved
by
the
court
as
if
it
were
an
issue
of
pure
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
whenever
the
question
before
a
trial
court
is,
in
the
same
sense
that
it
is
here,
one
in
which
facts
about
the
law
as
well
as
facts
about
the
world
outside
the
law
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration,
i
take
it
your
position
would
be,
when
that
is
the
sense
of
the
mixed
law
and
fact
question,
it's
always
going
to
be
a
question...
it
may
constitutionally
always
be
a
question
reserved
for
the
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
what
if
the
issue
involved
whether
this
particular
defendant
had
acted
as
a
reasonable
person
subject
to
the
legal
responsibilities
that
taxpayers
have
would
have
acted?
would
that...
which
sounds
like
what
we're
talking
about
here.
would
that
kind
of
a
question
be
one
for
the
court
alone?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
how
long
does
that...
that
goes...
takes
you
back
to
sometime
in
the
19th
century,
but
that's
as
far
as
that
tradition
goes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
would
be
going
a
step
beyond
that
if
we
hold
your
way
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
if
the
inquiry
becomes
one
about
what
the
reasonable
agent
does,
that's
no
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
of
the
fact
that
the
legal
responsibilities
inform
the
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
wasn't
traditionally
the
added
feature
of
materiality
something
to
do
with
importance?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
it's
irrelevant,
it's
immaterial,
when
you
get
to
immaterial
in
effect
you're
saying
well,
even
if
it
is
logically
relevant,
it
is
factually
so
trivial
as
to
be
unimportant
here.
wasn't
that
where
the
line
was--
