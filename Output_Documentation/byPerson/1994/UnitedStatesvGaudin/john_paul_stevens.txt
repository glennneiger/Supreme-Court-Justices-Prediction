justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
dreeben?
you
started
out
telling
us
there
are
three
reasons
we
should
affirm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
sinclair
case,
the
history
of
perjury
trials,
and
you
never
got
to
the
third.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
an
analogy
between
that,
and
i'm
not
sure
there
is,
and
the
earlier
discussion
you
had
with
some
of
the
other
of
my
colleagues
about
an
administrative
agency,
that
the
judge
might
well
instruct
the
jury
about
what
the
duties
of
the
agency
are
and
what
its
responsibilities
under
the
law,
but
then
leave
the
question...
with
that
kind
of
guidance
say
the
material
issues
shall
be
decided
in
that
light?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
i
don't
quite
follow
that,
because
it
might
well
be
true
that
fact
a
is
terribly
important
to
a
certain
group
of
administrators,
even
administering
the
same
statute,
whereas
other
administrators
may
say,
get
on
the...
say
we
never
pay
any
attention
to
fact
a.--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
should
not
matter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
position
on
the
perjury
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is
an
element,
isn't
it,
in
most
perjury
statutes...
materiality?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
you're
saying,
then,
the
whole
line
of
cases,
the
whole
perjury
line
of
cases
is
incorrectly
decided,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
didn't...
in
kungys
we
held
the
other
way,
didn't
we?
we
held
it
was
a
matter
for
the
judge
to
decide.
