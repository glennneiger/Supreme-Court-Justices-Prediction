justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
in
this
case
the
trial
court
held
a
hearing
to
determine
what
effect
the
agency
officials
give
to
these
applications?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view,
was
that
testimony
significant
in
helping
the
judge
form
his
conclusion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
were
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
i
wouldn't
have
had
the
slightest
idea
of
how
these
forms
worked,
and
that
i
would
have
wanted
to
hear
the
testimony,
and
that
indicates
that
it's
something
that
i
don't
know
much
about
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
that
is
a
jury
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
think
that
it
might
have
been
proper
in
a
case
like
this
for
the
judge
to
hold
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
in
order
to
make
his
determination,
or
her
determination,
whether
or
not
the
agency
would
reasonably
rely
on
these
matters,
whether
or
not
it
would
be
material?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that
ever
occur
in
any--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--other
kind
of
criminal
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
do
this
in
any
cases
where
the
issue
is
something
other
than
materiality?
have--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
could
say
that
as
to
whether
particular
acts
affect
interstate
commerce
under
the
hobbs
act,
and
that
always
goes
to
a
jury,
doesn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
could
say
the
same
thing
here.
you
could
say
the
same
thing
here,
and
there
could
be
uniformity
nationwide
as
to
what
the
standards
of
materiality
are.
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
if
you
find
that
in
processing
the
loan
application
this
is
of
relevance
to
the
agency,
then
you
may
determine
that
it
is
material.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
dreeben--
--the
test
is
whether
or
not
it
can
affect
the
agency--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
whether
or
not
it
is
likely
to?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
might
very
well
vary
from
region
to
region
in
the
country,
depending
on
the
way
a
statute
is
administered.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
perhaps
that
ought
not
to
be
the
case,
but
perhaps
that
is
in
fact
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
open
to
us
to
decide
this
case
in
your
favor
without
reaching
the
constitutional
determination
that
would
bind
the
states?
