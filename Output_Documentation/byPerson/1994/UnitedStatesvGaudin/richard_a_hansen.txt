mr.
richard
a.
hansen
it
is,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
that
the
government
is,
indeed,
asking
this
court
to
take
a
very
great
step
beyond
the
sixth
amendment
cases
and
the
due
process
cases
that
this
court
has
consistently
applied,
and
in
that
regard,
in
making
that
observation
it's
interesting
to
me
to
note
that
the
government's
position
has
evolved
considerably
from
its
opening
brief
to
its
reply
brief.
the
government
for
the
first
time
has
adopted
this
distinction
of...
between
public
and
private
officials.
it
urges
this
court
to
find
what
we
would
characterize
as
an
exception
to
the
sixth
amendment
and
to
the
fifth
amendment
requirements
of
winship
based
upon
that
distinction.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
it
did
not
revolutionize
the
criminal
law,
but
it
recognized,
for
example,
the
broad
application
of
that
fifth
amendment
requirement,
and
the
sixth
amendment
cases
certainly
do
recognize
that
wherever
the
court
is
dealing
with
a
fact
bound
element...
and
really
in
kungys,
even,
this
court
characterized
in
a
footnote
the
determination
of
materiality
as
fact
bound,
which
is
why
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
that
language.
whenever
that
is
the
case,
and
it's
an
essential
element,
as
the
government
concedes,
it
must
be
decided
by
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
with
due
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
can
distinguish
sinclair.
we
feel
that
sinclair
dealt
with
an
entirely
different
issue,
and
that
some
of
the
more
modern
cases
that
we
have
relied
upon
to
support
our
position
have
drawn
the
distinction
and
have
shown
the
confusion
between
perjury
and
materiality
where
materiality
is
an
essential
element.
in
sinclair,
the
question
was
the
pertinency
to
a
congressional
inquiry
in
the
teapot
dome
scandal.
in
sinclair,
the
court
specifically
stated
that
pertinency
in
that
context
is
akin
to
relevancy,
and
the
court
explained
that
it
involves
no
factual
determination.
that
was
essential
to
the
court's
holding
in
sinclair,
and
we
have
just
the
opposite
situation
here.
as
this
court
said
in
tfc
industries
v.
northway,
which
was
a
securities
fraud
case,
materiality
involves
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
i
think
that's
a
very
critical
issue
to
examine,
and
we
ask
the
court
to--
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
--i
certainly
will,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
feel
that
if
the
court
looks
at
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
record
in
the
other
cases
from
the
other
circuits,
the
court
will
see
that
it
is
a
fact
bound
inquiry.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
reference
to
a
single
regulation
or
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
no,
you
don't,
and
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
court
never
did
look
at
a
single
statute.
if
the
government's
position
is
correct,
then
this
court
should
reverse
my
client's
convictions
based
upon
the
government's
position,
because
there
was
no
single
statute,
regulation,
or
anything
of
the
kind
ever
referred
to.
what
the
court
heard
in
deciding
materiality
in
this
case
was
common
sense
testimony
from
bank
officials
that
we
want
to
know
who's
paying
the
closing
costs
because
a)
that
helps
us
calculate
the
amount
of
the
loan--
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
--et
cetera.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
you
would,
and
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
every
court
that's
examined
it
has
determined
that
materiality
is
an
essential
element.
now,
some
of
the
courts
who
have
ruled
against
us,
like
in
the
hausmann
opinion,
have
stated,
there
is
merit
to
the
argument
that
this
should
be
decided
by
the
jury,
but
the
united
states
supreme
court
will
have
to
address
sinclair
before
we
can
rule
in
your
favor.
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
that
have
questioned
this
antiquated
rule.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
materiality
is
stated
that...
directly
in
the
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
yes,
a
material
fact,
and
i
think
it's
instructive
that
the
statute
itself
talks
about
material
facts.
we're
not
talking
about
legal
standards,
as
the
government
would--
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
--argue
to
this
court.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
we
submit
that
it
does.
we
submit
that--
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
--there's
much
more
to
it
that
supports
my
conclusion
that
it
is
factual.
if
one
looks
at
the
cases,
at
the
nature
and
character
of
the
testimony
presented
in
this
case,
for
example,
which
is
a
prime
example,
it
was
entirely
factual.
there
is
no
reference
made
to
guidelines.
the
loan
officer
said,
i
want
to
know
who's
paying
the
closing
costs,
because
it
affects
whether
we
issue
title
insurance,
for
example.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
i
would
say
that
the
similarity,
the
much
stronger
similarity
exists
between
1001
prosecutions,
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
court
proceeding,
as
perjury
does,
or
with
a
congressional
proceeding.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
justice
breyer,
as
many
of
the
cases
have
said,
the
distinction
between
law
and
fact
which
the
government
is
resting
upon
here--
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
--i
agree
that
that
analogy
of
law
and
fact
does
not
help.
it
doesn't
enlighten.
i
think
the
better
comparison,
though,
is
the
issue
of
materiality
and
the
way
it
is
determined
in
securities
fraud
cases,
bank
fraud
cases,
wire
fraud
cases,
and
mail
fraud
cases,
where
this
court
has
historically,
and
every
court
has
historically
held
that
that
must
be
submitted
to
the
jury
as
a
matter
of
sixth
amendment
and
fifth
amendment
jurisprudence.
i
think
once
you
realize
that
1001,
and
look
at
it
for
what
it
is,
which
is
a
generic
false
statement
statute
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
courtrooms,
the
better
analogy
is
to
the
securities
fraud
cases,
which
often
involve
complex
practices.
as
this
court
said
in
santa
fe
industries
we've
got...
that's
discussed
in
our
brief,
that
it's
difficult
for
juries,
but
nevertheless
the
jury
has
to
decide
whenever
it's
an
element
of
the
offense,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
most
pertinent
and
important
distinction
here
to
be
drawn
is
whether
it's
an
element
of
the
offense.
now,
in
sinclair,
it
was
akin
to
relevance.
the
court
was
determining
in
sinclair
that
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
that
was
a
pertinent
question
to
the
inquiry,
and
certainly
it
was
akin
to
relevance,
and
the
court
did
emphatically
say,
it
does
not
require
any
resolution
of
the
probative
force
of
any
evidence.
here
we
have--
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
--in
sinclair
the
court
uses
the
term,
element.
i
acknowledge
that
it
does,
in
it's
holding.
it
was
not
an
element
in
the
sense
that
we
are
speaking
of
here,
where
all
the
courts
have
said--
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
--whether
it
was
a
proper
question,
was
the
issue
in
sinclair.
the
defendant
in
that
case
said,
you're
asking
about
my
private
affairs,
regarding
my
business
dealings,
you
have
no
right
to
ask
that,
and
he
refused
to
answer.
now,
it
would
be,
i
think,
much
more
analogous
to
a
contempt
situation,
where
one
might
raise,
or
in
the
hugh
act
cases,
where
one
might
raise
the
relevance
in
the
priority
of
the
question
as
a
defense.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
no,
and
it's
not
the
way
the
courts
have
treated
it
under
1001
or
under
securities
fraud
cases,
where
it's
clearly,
legislatively,
an
element
of
the
offense
that
must
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
think
that
there's
a
great
potential
here
for
confusion
between--
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
--relevance--
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
--and
elements.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
but
that's
not
what
happens
in
these
cases,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
well,
i
would
submit
that
the
same
kind
of
cross
examination
that
has
occurred
in
past
cases
where
the
court
has
determined
it
would
be
the
same
kind
of
cross
examination
that
would
occur
if
the
jury
determined
it,
namely...
in
this
case
was
the
payment
of
38
in
closing
costs,
which
is
the
lowest
amount
of
any
of
the
accounts
in
a
multi
10,000
loan
transaction.
why
was
that
important
to
you?
you
could
ask
the
same
questions
on
cross
examination.
and
i
think
it's
curious
to
note
that
this
case
could
have
been
prosecuted
as
a
bank
fraud
case,
and
if
that
had
occurred,
the
witnesses
would
have
been
the
same,
the
questions
would
have
been
the
same,
the
issue
would
have
been
the
same,
but
it
would
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
materiality,
because
under
that
statute,
bank
fraud,
which
is
certainly
much
more
similar
to
this
case
than
perjury
cases,
it
is
a
jury
question,
and
that's
very
well
established.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
my
position
is
that
any
other
statutes
need
to
be
examined
for
legislative
extent.
if
materiality
is
an
essential
element
of
the
statute,
whether
it
be
perjury
or
a
different
statute,
then
i
think,
consistent
with
the
sixth
amendment
and
with
all
of
this
court's
decisions
about
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
structural
guarantee
of
the
sixth
amendment,
and
the
importance
of
submitting
all
elements
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
jury
no
matter
how
overwhelming
the
evidence,
i
would
say
if
it's
an
element,
then
even
under
some
perjury
statutes
it
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
it
certainly
is
with--
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
--i
wouldn't
say
the
whole
line,
but
i
would
say
that
some
of
them
are
troubling.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
and
i
think
the
distinction,
again,
must
be,
is
it
an
element
of
the
offense?
is
it
something
that
the
jury
has
the
ability
to
decide?
and
with
regard
to
materiality
under
the
generic
false
statement
statute,
the
answer
is
certainly
yes,
the
jury
can
decide
it.
we
just
have
to
look
to
the
securities
cases
and
the
bank
fraud
cases
to
see
that
juries
routinely
decide
this
based
on
pattern
jury
instructions.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
i
would
urge
this
court
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue
and,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
government,
i
believe
that
the
government
has
avoided
the
constitutional
issue
because
i
think
there
is
no
good
answer
to
the
question,
if
it's
an
element
of
the
offense,
why
shouldn't
the
jury
be
deciding
it,
particularly
if
it
is
a
fact
bound
element?
why
shouldn't
it
be
decided
like
every
other
element?
every
element,
to
some
extent,
of
every
criminal
offense
requires
application
of
the
law
to
the
facts.
we
call
upon
juries
to
do
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
mandate
in
every
criminal
case.
kungys,
of
course,
was
not
criminal.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
i
think
what
the
court
needs
to
do,
as
other
courts
that
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief,
many
of
them
state
supreme
courts,
the
number
isn't
many,
perhaps,
but
several...
state
v.
anderson
and
others,
and
judge
posner
in
the
staniforth
case,
which
we
discuss...
the
court
needs
to
clarify
that
there
is
a
difference
between
relevance,
as
that
term
is
used
in
sinclair,
and
materiality
as
that
term
is
used
in
a
false
statement
to
a
government
official
or
in
a
securities
fraud
case.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
as
different
as
night
from
day,
and
i
think
that's
the
reason
there
has
been
some
confusion.
materiality
as
a
concept
of
relevancy
is
antiquated,
and
i
think
some
of
the
perjury
cases
are
antiquated
that
the
government
relies
upon.
materiality,
when
it's
an
essential
element
of
the
offense,
is
subject
to
a
very
clear
definition.
this
court
set
forth
that
definition
in
kungys.
devitt,
blackmar
and
o'malley
has
a
conceptually
indistinguishable
definition
which
should
be
used
with
juries
for
deciding
materiality.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
it's
not--
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
--justice
breyer,
relevance
would
not
be
out
the
window.
i
think...
well,
one
unit
of
research
that
was
not
included
in
our
brief
concerns
the
hugh
act
cases,
and
in
any
proceeding
where
a
witness
feels
that
they
should
not
answer
a
question
because
it's
not
relevant,
it's
not
germane,
their
attorney
or
they
should
raise
an
objection,
and
that's
a
procedural
requirement
under
the
hugh
act
cases
that
were
decided
mainly
by
this
court
in
the
fifties.
relevance
is
not
out
the
window.
relevance
is
a
different
concept.
it
has
a
different
place
and
a
different
application
than
an
essential
fact
bound
element
of
a
criminal
offense,
which
is
what
materiality
is.
and
again,
i
think
we
confuse
materiality
and
relevance
because
of
the
reason
stated
by
justice
ginsburg,
that
it
used
to
be
part
of
a
litany
of
objections
that
attorneys
made
in
courtrooms.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
in
the
prior
context,
your
honor,
immaterial
meant,
it's
not
relevant,
it's
not
probative
of
the
issues
here
in
court,
and
that
was
an
objection
that
was--
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
--i
believe
it's
been
subsumed
within
the
objection,
it's
not
relevant,
in
modern
practice.
i
know
that
i
was
taught
in
law
school
evidence
class
not
to
make
that
objection
any
more
because
judges
want
precise
objections.
it's
not
relevant.
it's
too
prejudicial.
it's
incompetent.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
i
think
so.
i
think
it's
been
a
vague
concept.
i
think
maybe
it's
similar,
now,
to
the
federal
rule
of
evidence
403.
it
may
have
some
relevance
but
it's
overly
prejudicial
or
time
consuming
or
a
burden
upon
the
court.
to
finish
answering
justice
ginsburg's
question,
relevance...
materiality
is
defined
by
kungys
very
adequately,
and
again
i
would
reiterate,
in
different
terms,
but
conceptually
indistinguishably
from
the
devitt
and
blackmar
and
o'malley
definition.
is
it
of
the
type
of
information
that
would
likely
be
relied
upon
by
the
person,
whether
it's
a
government
official,
or
a
stockbroker,
or
a
bank,
in
making
the
official
decision
that
is
at
issue
in
that
case?
mr.
richard
a.
hansen
only,
i
submit,
because
there
was
no
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
kungys,
and
the
court
in
kungys
made
clear
that
it's
very
much
a
factual
inquiry.
in
kungys,
a
denaturalization
proceeding,
the
defendant
had
been
deported,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
or
should
be
denaturalized,
because
he
had
misstated
his
age,
and
they
were
concerned...
the
court
was
concerned,
the
government
was
concerned
that
he
had
previously
worked
at
a
nazi
death
camp.
he
had
his
own
explanation
for
why
he
had
changed
his
date
of
birth,
and
that
was
to
avoid
nazi
persecution
when
he
was
a
resident
of
germany,
and
because
he
claimed
that
he
had
worked
with
the
lithuanian
resistance.
in
that
case,
the
court
states
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
opinion,
and
i
quote
the
phrase
from
a
body
that
this
court
reiterated
and
quoted
in
kungys,
"materiality
rests
upon
a
factual,
evidentiary
showing.
"
and
at
another
point
in
discussing
the
opinion,
or
the
test
in
kungys,
the
court
stated
that
"there
are
an
infinite
variety
of
factual
patterns
that
would
affect
materiality.
"
it
is
clearly
the
kind
of
factual
dispute
that
a
jury
should
resolve,
and
it
bears
no
resemblance,
i
submit,
to
the
question
of
relevance
and
materiality
as
that
term
has
been
used
in
the
past.
in
conclusion,
i
would
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
we
feel
that
the
distinction
that
the
government
is
drawing,
based
upon
whether
the
person
lied
to,
in
effect,
is
a
government
official,
or
a
bank,
or
a
securities
firm,
is
not
a
valid
distinction,
and
it
certainly
is
not
a
valid
reason
for
overriding
the
very
important
sixth
amendment
requirement
that
a
jury
pass
upon
all
factual
elements
in
a
criminal
offense.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
