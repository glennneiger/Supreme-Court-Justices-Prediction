chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94
514,
the
united
states
v.
michael
gaudin.
is
that
the
way
your
client
pronounces
his
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
principle
of
judicial
notice
have
any
application
in
criminal
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
hansen,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
speak
of
the
requirements
of
winship,
mr.
hansen.
the
holding
of
winship,
as
i
recall,
was
that
the
burden
of
proof
in
juvenile
court
was
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
just
as
it
was
in
adult
court.
i
never
read
that
case
to
simply
revolutionize
the
criminal
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
with
the
sinclair
case?
that's
a
precise
holding
right
on
the
issue
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
materiality
involve
the
same
kind
of
inquiry
every
single
time
you
have
the
word
materiality?
what
precisely
is
the
issue
here
under
1001?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
will
you
examine
it
right
now?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
whether
it's
a
fact
bound
inquiry
or
what
the
precise
element
is,
you
look
at
the
statute
for
it.
you
don't
look
at
a
bunch
of
records
in
other
cases,
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
question
presented
by
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari...
in
a
prosecution
under
section
1001
for
making
false
statements
in
a
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
agency,
is
the
materiality
of
those
statements
to
be
resolved
by
the
court
rather
than
the
jury
+/?
i
would
think
you'd
look
at
1001
for
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
in
looking
at
the
language
of
1001,
where
do
you
find
the
materiality
requirement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
material
fact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it
says--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--wilfully
falsifies,
conceals,
or
covers
up
a
material
fact.
that
fact
that
it
says,
covers
up
a
fact,
doesn't
mean
that
materiality
is
a
factual
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
submit
that
just
because
the
noun,
fact,
is
being
modified
by
the
adjective,
material,
that
means
that...
the
adjective
means
it's
a
factual
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
was
not
an
element
of
the
offense
in
sinclair?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
difference
between
the
sense
we're
speaking
of
it
here
and
the
sense
it
was
used
in
sinclair?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
not
the
way
the
court
treated
it
in
sinclair.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--there's
also,
i
think,
a
great
potential
for
confusion
if
you
can
bring
in
all
sorts
of
witnesses
that
would
say,
you
know,
a
reasonable
person
would
have
thought
this,
or
a
reasonable
person
would
have
thought
that,
about
whether
an
agency
official
might
have...
you
know,
you
can
probably
bring
in
the
whole
hierarchy
of
the
agency
and
get
18
different
answers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
may
not
be
what's
happened
so
far
because
no
circuit
agrees
with
the
ninth
circuit,
but
if
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed
i
think
it
will
start
happening.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you're
saying
now
is
that
we
should
simply
go
through
the
statute
books
and
through
all
our
decided
cases
and
apply
this
very
bright
line
rule
that
you're
talking
about.
we'll
have
to
overrule
some
cases,
but
presumably
the
abstract
symmetry
that
you're
seeking
will
be
accomplished.
i
think
the
sixth
amendment
does
require
something
similar
to
that,
and
i
would
point
out,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
inconsistency
that
exists
here
is
not
simply
between
1001
and
perjury,
which
is
not
a
very
often
brought
prosecution,
but
rather
between
1001
and
bank
fraud,
mail
fraud,
securities,
fraud,
which
are
very
commonly
employed
statutes,
criminal
and
civil,
and
in
all
of
those
cases
there
is
a
glaring
anomaly,
i
would
submit,
that
this
court
should
clarify,
because
in
all
of
those
cases
the
jury
routinely
decides
the
issue
of
materiality
based
on
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so
we'd
have
to
go
back
and
also
change
the
rule
on
relevance
in
a
perjury
conviction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hansen.
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
your
opponent's
argument
that
if
that
is
sound,
then
we
should
go
the
other
way,
i
suppose
he
says
in
the
bank,
in
the
mail,
in
the
securities
fraud
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court,
number
94-514
united
states
versus
gaudin
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
