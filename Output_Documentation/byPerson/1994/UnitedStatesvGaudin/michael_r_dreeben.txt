mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
issue
of
materiality
in
a
prosecution
under
18
u.s.c.
1001
is
an
issue
of
law
for
the
court
or
an
issue
of
fact
for
the
jury
to
decide.
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
its
en
banc
decision
in
this
case
that
materiality
presents
a
factual
matter
that
must
be
decided
by
the
jury
under
this
court's
due
process
and
sixth
amendment
decisions.
in
so
holding,
it
disagreed
with
the
holding
of
every
other
regional
court
of
appeals
that
had
considered
the
question,
as
well
as
this
court's
decision
under
an
analogous
statute
under
sinclair
v.
united
states.
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
is
incorrect
for
three
reasons.
first,
this
court's
decision
in
sinclair
and
its
more
recent
decision
in
kungys
v.
united
states
establish
that
the
issue
of
materiality
in
a
prosecution
for
making
false
statements
to
a
government
body
is
a
legal
issue
and,
as
such,
it
is
properly
a
matter
for
the
court
to
resolve.
second,
the
classification
of
materiality
as
an
issue
of
law
has
deep
historical
roots
in
the
law
of
perjury,
and
that
law
has
always
recognized
that
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
false
statement
is
material
raises
a
question
of
law
for
decision
by
the
courts.
that
long
history
is
critical
in
resolving
the
question
of
the
propriety
and
constitutionality
of
deciding
materiality
by
the
court.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
it
might
make
sense
in
some
cases
to
describe
it
as
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
justice
o'connor,
but
the
question
of
what
kinds
of
facts
need
to
be
determined
either
in
a
perjury
or
a
prosecution
under
1001
is
very
different
from
the
kinds
of
historical
facts
that
we
usually
associate
with
a
jury
determination
such
as,
did
the
defendant
do
it,
and
what
his
intent
was.
in
a
perjury
case,
the
kinds
of
considerations
that
come
to
bear
are,
what
were
the
issues
in
the
prior
trial,
and
what
was
the
transcript
of
evidence
before
the
finder
of
fact
in
the
prior
trial.
those
kinds
of
factual
matters
are
not
really
the
kind
of
thing
that
call
for
a
jury
to
sort
out
conflicting
evidence,
except
perhaps
in
the
rare
case
which
arose
in
the
19th
century,
when
there
was
no
transcript
of
the
trial
and
there
had
to
be
some
decision
made
about
what
the
defendant
actually
said
and
what
was
at
issue
in
a
particular
trial.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
a
normal
1001
prosecution
the
ultimate
question
that
the
court
is
asking
is,
would
the
particular
misstatement
have
the
capability
of
affecting
the
decision
of
the
agency,
and
the
proposition
to
be
established
is,
what
are
the
agency's
functions
as
a
matter
of
law,
what
is
it
authorized
to
carry
out
and,
in
some
cases,
it
may
go
down
to
a
somewhat
more
refined
policy
level
of
what
is
the
agency
actually
trying
to
do
within
the
broad
scope
of
its
statutory
mandate?
certainly
the
question
of
what
the
agency
is
authorized
to
do
as
a
matter
of
law
is
a
pure
legal
question.
it
requires
the
consultation
of
statutes,
sometimes
of
regulations,
perhaps
of
legislative
history,
but
those
are
all
materials
that
a
court
deals
with
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
in
this
case
the
judge
held
a
hearing
on
that.
there
was
testimony
at
the
trial,
more
along
the
lines
of
the
testimony
that
justice
o'connor
was
describing,
testimony
about
would
the
false
statements
on
the
hud
forms
in
question
have
affected
the
agency's
decision
to
make
a
loan,
that
all
came
in
at
trial,
and
the
judge
then
instructed
the
jury
before
the
jury
got
the
case
that
the
issue
of
materiality
was
for
the
court
to
resolve
as
one
of
law,
and
there
was
no
debate
that
i
have
seen
in
the
transcript
about
whether
the
materiality
element
was
satisfied
in
this
case.
it
doesn't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
know,
since
the
judge
didn't
write
an
opinion.
it
may
very
well
have
informed
his
decision
in
the
matter,
although
there
were
other
ways
that
materiality
could
have
been
proved
in
this
case,
but
our
position--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that
it
indicates
that
the
details
of
any
particular
program
are
something
that
needs
to
be
established
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that's
hearing
the
particular
case,
but
that
alone,
in
our
view,
isn't
enough
to
treat
the
issue
as
one
that
must
be
resolved
by
the
jury.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
judge
could
have
held
a
hearing
outside
the
hearing
of
the
jury.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
it
does--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
it
does
occur
in
this
kind
of
case
as
well
as
in
a
perjury
case
where
judges
want
to
decide
the
issue
of
materiality
and
for
one
reason
or
another
the
evidence
isn't
admissible
in
the
case
in
chief,
so
that
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
there
are
very
many
issues
like
that,
there
aren't
too
many
of
them.
one
analogous
area
where
the
judge
does
decide
a
question
that
may
turn
on
facts
is
whether
a
particular
piece
of
property
is
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
which
is
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
as
well
as
an
element
of
many
offenses
that
the
united
states
prosecutes.
it's
settled
that
the
court
determines
whether
a
particular
piece
of
property
is
within
the
territory
of
the
united
states,
and
i
think
that
rule
would
apply
whether
the
judge
was
looking
at
a
deed,
or
whether
he
was
looking
at
a
description
of
land
and
needed
to
hear
some
evidence
about
what
that
land
actually
entailed,
so
that
is
not
a
totally
unknown
process.
but
our
position
here
is
largely
one
that
is
predicated
on
the
long
historical
view
that
determining
whether
a
particular
piece
of
information
or
a
particular
misstatement
is
material
is
something
that
the
court
does
do.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
do
concede
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
the
line
that
history
has
drawn
is
between
the
materiality
of
false
statements
to
private
parties
and
the
materiality
of
false
statements
to
government
bodies,
and
we
accept
that
line
as
one
that
has
enough
basis
in
reason
to
survive
the
question
of
whether
it
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
basic
question
in
determining
the
materiality
of
a
false
statement
to
a
private
party
is
how
a
reasonable
person
would
react
to
that
statement,
and
the
question
of
how
reasonable
people
do
things
has
been
in
our
system
one
that
we've
been
very
comfortable
assigning
to
juries.
and
it's,
of
course,
assigned
to
the
jury
in
the
negligence
context,
and
there
really
is
an
analogy
between
the
reasonable
person
standard
in
determining
materiality
and
the
reasonable
person
standard
in
tort
law
that
justifies
certainly
that
long
tradition
of
having
materiality
issues
decided
by
the
jury
when
they
are
to
private
parties.
when
government
bodies
are
at
issue,
in
contrast,
the
highest
level
of
generality
of
the
question,
and
i
would
submit
also
most
of
the
lower
levels,
or
more
specific
levels
of
analysis,
have
to
do
with
what
that
agency's
policies
and
practices
are,
which
raises
a
determination
that
in
many
cases
is
a
pure
question
of
law.
and
even
in
those
cases
where
it
requires
some
consideration
of
evidence
about
what
the
agency
actually
does,
the
ultimate
inquiry
focuses
on
what
that
agency's
policies
are,
which
is
something
that
should
not
be
resolved
differently
in
courtroom
around
the
country
depending
upon
whether
a
particular
jury
accepts
or
rejects
testimony.
it
should
rather
be
resolved
on
a
uniform
basis,
considering
all
of
the
evidence
that's
available,
including
agency
regulations
and
policies.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
not
making
the
factual
assumption
that
every
judge
would
agree,
but
i
do
make
the
assertion
that
when
a
question
of
law
is
at
issue
there
is
only
one
right
answer
to
the
question
that
judges
should
reach
in
determining
whether
an
agency
would
have
viewed
particular
information--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
question
of
what
is
proved
in
a
particular
case
does
go
to
the
jury,
but
i
think
that
judges
routinely
instruct
juries
that
if
certain
facts
are
found
they
constitute
the
requisite
effect
on
interstate
commerce--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
substantial
potential
for
disuniformity
if
you
entrust
the
question
of
whether
an
agency
would
have
been
capable
of
being
influenced
by
a
particular
piece
of
information
to
juries.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the...
in
our
system,
the
threshold
question
of
deciding
whether
the
jury
decides
a
particular
issue
is
how
the
court
system,
the
judicial
system,
classifies
it
as
an
issue
of
law
or
an
issue
of
fact.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
it
involves
the
court
in
total
circularity,
justice
souter.
what
i
think
that
it
does
is
require
the
court
to
look
back
into
the
legal
traditions
that
have
always
informed
the
determination
of
whether
a
particular
issue
is
factual
or
legal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
dispute,
justice
souter,
the
inquiry
of
1001
does
involve
a
bit
more
than
a
strict
relational
inquiry,
but
i
submit
that
the
core
of
the
inquiry
is
a
relational
issue,
and
the
determination
of
what
the
fact
must
relate
to...
in
other
words,
what
the
policy
actually
is...
is
in
most
cases
one
that
can
be
resolved
as
a
pure
question
of
law,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
court
should
assume
that
in
the
typical
1001
case
that
the
issue
is
whether
some
individual
agency
official
sitting
in
some
office
can
dictate
whether
the
government
values
or
doesn't
value
particular
information
based
on
his
testimony.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
right,
and
i
think
that
what--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
certainly
what
a
reasonable
person...
a
reasonable
private
person
would
do
is
one
that
tort
law
has
assigned
to
the
jury
system,
but
what
a
reasonable
agency
official
would
do,
what
a
hypothetical
reasonable
governmental
official
would
do
is
a
categorically
different
question.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
i
think
just
to
state
that
proposition,
justice
souter,
is
to
illustrate
why
it's
an
appropriate
determination
for
a
court.
determining
and
interpreting
how
the
law
and
particular
statutes
and
regulations
bear
on
an
agency
official's
assessment
of
a
problem
is
not
something
that
we
typically
entrust
juries
to
do,
and
i
think
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
it
doesn't,
and
the
reason
that
i
think
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
make
such
a
sweeping
analysis
in
this
case
in
order
to
decide
it
in
the
government's
favor
is
that
the
notion
of
what
constitutes
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
is
one
that
we
commonly
use
and
associate
with
the
standards
applicable
to
appellate
review.
it's
not
one
that
we
typically
use
for
sorting
out
what
questions
have
to
be
decided
by
a
jury
versus
what
questions
may
be
decided
by
a
judge,
and
as
a
result,
we
use
the
words,
mixed
question
of
law
or
fact,
in
a
variety
of
different
ways
that
don't
have
any
bearing
on
this
particular
problem.
this
problem--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
would
not
go
that
far,
and
i
don't
think
that
i
have
to
go
that
far.
there
may
be
questions
about
a
defendant's
intent
in
particular
circumstances
that
could
be
described
as
your
honor
has
described
them,
as
bearing
on
how
the
defendant
saw
particular
laws
and
regulations
as
bearing
on
his
conduct,
say,
in
a
tax
fraud
prosecution,
and
it's
not
the
government's
position
that
you
could
take
the
ultimate
issue
of
intent
from
the
jury
in
a
question
like
that,
simply
because
there
may
be
some
legal
principles
that
come
to
bear
on
a
set
of
facts
that
the
jury
has
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
so,
not
in
a
criminal
case,
and
again,
what
we
are
primarily
talking
about
there
is
the
difference
between
private
conduct
and
the
conduct
of
those
people
who
are
agents
of
and
who
represent
the
government,
and
we're
talking
about
that
against
the
backdrop
of
a
very
long
tradition
in
our
law,
not
only
in
perjury
cases
but
also
in
cases
that
arise
under
section
1001,
which
is
a
fairly
broad
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the...
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain
from
reviewing
all
of
the
legal
sources
available,
although
the
crime
of
perjury
is
a
very
old
crime
and
it
has
always
included
an
issue
of
materiality
as
a
prerequisite
for
conviction,
there
doesn't
seem
to
have
been
very
much
debate
on
the
issue
until
the
19th
century.
in
the
early
part
of
the
19th
century,
courts
did
address
the
question
and
reported
decisions,
and
they
resolved
it
with
a
uniformity
that
i
think
is
rather
rare
in
common
law
and
early
criminal
law
decisions
by
holding
that
the
issue
of
materiality
is
one
that
judges
decide.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
that...
i
think
the
step,
if
the
court
has
to
take
a
step
further,
is
a
very
small
step
indeed,
because
it
was
always
recognized,
as
i
said,
even
in
the
perjury
cases,
that
there
might
have
to
be
some
limited
amount
of
fact
finding
to
determine
what
the
issues
in
the
prior
trial
were,
and
to
determine
what
the
testimony
is
alleged
to
be,
and
i
think
that
those
really
form
analogues
to
what
courts
have
to
do
in
resolving
materiality
under
section
1001.
they
have
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
did.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
it
was
our--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we
do
not
think
this
should
be
plain
error.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
in
fact,
we
believe
that
it
would
be
preferable,
from
the
government's
standpoint,
to
have
this
legal
issue
resolved
on
its
merits
because
courts
are
instructing
juries
quite
often
on
how
materiality
should
be
resolved
in
section
1001
prosecutions.
and
the
ninth
circuit
hinted
very
strongly
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
take
materiality
from
the
jury
in
a
perjury
prosecution,
and
we
would
like
to
have
a
uniform
national
rule
that
is
compatible
with
what
all
of
the
circuits
but
the
ninth
circuit
have
said,
which
is
that
the
court
may
continue
to
resolve
this
issue
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
we're
not
as
interested
in
having
a
plain
error
determination
on
the
particularized
facts
of
this
case,
even
though--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
the
third
one
has
been
brought
out
in
the
court's
questions,
which
is
that
once
the
determination
that
a
question
before
the
court
is
one
that
is
classifiable
as
a
legal
issue,
this
court's
decisions
in
in
re
winship,
which
recognized
a
principle
that
antedated
in
re
winship
and
that
has
been
since
reaffirmed,
namely
that
the
jury
must
decide
the
factual
components
of
an
offense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
is
not
implicated.
the
primary
question
here
is,
is
it
a
permissible
determination
under
the
united
states
constitution
for
legislatures
to
make
the
issue
of
materiality
one
resolvable
by
a
court,
and
our
answer
to
that
is
yes,
in
view
of
the
very
long
legal
tradition
that
views
that
as
a
question
of
law.
as
a
result,
the
in
re
winship
line
of
cases,
which
do
not
concern
the
distinction
between
issues
of
law
and
fact,
simply
is
not
implicated
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
hesitate
to
give
very
many
examples,
because
the
issue
doesn't
arise
often
enough
to
generalize.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
would
not
be
able
to
give
your
honor
that
assurance.
there
are
a
certain
number
of
instances
in
which
courts
have
done
it.
the
ninth
circuit
did
it,
for
example,
in
deciding
whether
a
particular
property
was
property
of
the
united
states
in
a
prosecution
for
stealing
property
of
the
united
states.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
haven't
seen
the
question
put.
i
think
it
might
depend
on
what
kind
of
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
it
is.
if
the
claim
is
that
excessive
force
was
used
and
therefore
it
became
unreasonable,
the
question
of
whether
the
force
is
excessive
might
be
viewed
as
one
that's
appropriate
for
a
jury.
if
the
issue
were
whether
police
are
authorized
to
stop
somebody
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
and
conduct
a
brief
pat
down
search,
then
that's
a
question
of
law
resolved
by
this
court's
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
does,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
is
the
proper
body
for
resolving
the
issue.
i
don't
think
that
i've
seen
cases
in
which
courts
drew
upon
judicial
notice
to
instruct
the
jury
as
a
particular
matter,
but
that
might
be,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
kind
of
thing
that
has
a
family
resemblance
to
determining
what
is
the
territory
of
the
united
states
in
a
prosecution
that
depends
on
proving
that
a
particular
crime
occurred
within
the
territory
of
the
united
states.
the
jury
decides
where
did
this
crime
occur?
the
judge
instructs
the
jury
based
on
consulting
materials
of
which
he
may
take
judicial
notice,
i
assume,
that
a
particular
piece
of
land
belongs
to
the
united
states,
and
that
allocation
of
authority
between
the
judge
and
jury
has
never
seemed
to
raise
any
problems
in
any
of
the
reported
cases
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that's
the
strongest
analogy
that
respondent
could
have
in
support
of
his
position,
but
i
would
return
to
three
reasons
why
that
is
not
the
path
this
court
should
go
down
in
this
case.
the
first
is
that
the
ultimate
quarry
here,
the
ultimate
object
of
the
materiality
inquiry,
does
depend
on
a
conclusion
about
what
the
agency
is
legally
authorized
and
is
doing,
and
whether
a
particular
piece
of
information
could
affect
that
determination,
and
i
would
submit
that
whether
the
question
of
the
agency's
actions
is
resolved
at
the
level
of
explicit
statutory
direction,
less
explicit
but
perhaps
embodied
in
policies,
or
policy
statements,
or
even
testimony
by
agency
officials,
it's
all
the
same
generic
inquiry.
it's
an
inquiry
into
the
agency's
legally
authorized
activities.
the
second
reason
is
that
i
don't
believe
that
kind
of
a
question
should
be
resolved
differently
around
the
country
in
different
courtrooms
depending
on
whether
a
particular
jury
believes
this
agency
official
who
says
yes,
we
always
consider
this
kind
of...
piece
of
information
in
making
a
decision,
versus
another
jury
who
credits
some
former
agency
official
who
says,
oh,
no,
that
was
never
important
to
us.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
under
section
1001--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
contrast
to
some
statutes
that
does
not
matter
at
all,
because
the
ultimate
legal
issue
is
whether
it
could
affect
the
activities
of
a
department
or
agency.
it's
resolved
at
a
very
high
level
of
generality.
it's
different
from
the
materiality
inquiry
in
a
case
like
kungys
v.
united
states,
where
it
was
whether
this
particular
individual
who
received
citizenship
procured
his
citizenship
by
a
material
misrepresentation.
that
is
not
the
level
of
generality
at
which
you
resolve
materiality
in
section
1001.
it's
much
higher
than--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--whether
it's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--whether
it's
predictably
capable
of,
or
whether
it
has
a
natural
tendency
to
affect
the
agency
or--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
as
a
particular
factual
matter--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
it
can,
but
it
has
never
been
the
law
that
under
section
1001
particular
agency
officials
that
occupy
particular
positions
are
able
to
nullify
what
could
affect
that
agency's
determination
under
its
overall
authority
and
program
to
act.
it
simply
isn't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that--
[laughter]
--if
we
did
let
it
go
to
the
jury
we
would
be
inviting
all
kinds
of
defenses
that
depended
on
whether
a
particular
agency
official
actually
knew
that
the
statement
was
false
and
therefore
couldn't
possibly
have
been
affected
by
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
that
strongly
supports
the
position
that
we're
taking
that
materiality
is
not
something
that
individual
agency
officials
are
in
a
position
to
create
or
destroy
by
their
individual
conduct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
court
has
never
framed
the
inquiry
in
terms
of
a
reasonable
agency
official,
and
i
would
further
submit
that
the
question
of
what
reasonable
governmental
actors
do
is
quite
different
from
reasonable
private
actors.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
in
our
view,
there
has
always
been
in
a
perjury
case
the
need
to
ascertain
predicate
facts
in
order
to
make
a
determination
of
materiality,
but
that
has
never
meant
to
courts
around
the
country
that
the
ultimate
question
was
a
factual
one
that
had
to
be
decided
by
a
jury
rather
than
a
determination
that
the
court
made.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think,
justice
souter,
that's
the
same
distinction
that
we
were
discussing
earlier
between
the
effect
of
the
representation
on
a
reasonable
private
person
and
the
effect
of
a
representation
on
a
government
agent.
in
kungys
and
sinclair,
this
court
did
ascertain
what
the
particular
governmental
entity
was
doing.
it
ascertained
that
the
ins
was
seeking
to
determine
whether
somebody
was
qualified
for
citizenship.
in
sinclair,
the
court
had
to
determine
what
the
congressional
inquiry
was
in
order
to
figure
out
whether
a
question
was
pertinent
to
it.
but
once
it
had
ascertained
those
predicate
facts,
which
i
think
are
analogous,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
to
the
determination
of
what
the
agency's
program
is,
the
ultimate
application
of
the
legal
standard
is
one
that
the
court
can
do
as
a
matter
of
law.
thank
you.
