--but
mr.
dreeben,
you
recognize
that
in
the
case
of
material
misrepresentations
to
a
private
party,
for
example
in
the
securities
area,
that
those
are
regarded
as
questions
for
the
jury,
the
materiality
of
a
misrepresentation,
say,
in
a
proxy
statement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
how...
what
is
the
distinction?
do
you
just
say,
whenever
it's
to
a
government
agency
it's
for
the
judge,
and
whenever
it's
to
a
nongovernmental
entity
it's
for
the
jury,
and
what's
the
rhyme
or
reason?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
assuming
that
judges
will
all
agree,
so
it
would
be...
every
judge
would
agree
on
what's
material.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
have
any
relationship
to
special
doctrines
that
apply
to
actors
for
the
government,
like
there's
no
estoppel
against
the
government
based
on
the
particular
agent's...
is
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
as
it
is
used
in
evidence.
the
standard
litany,
when
you're
objecting
to
a
question,
is,
your
honor,
it's
incompetent,
irrelevant,
immaterial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
immaterial
mean
something
different
than
the
materiality
concept
that
you
are
discussing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
you
can
define
them
for
us.
when...
tell
me
what
the
old,
and
now
you
say
obsolete,
immaterial
meant
as
distinguished
from
relevant,
and
then
tell
me
what
material
means
in
the
context
of
this
1001
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
a
synonym
for
relevant,
then.
