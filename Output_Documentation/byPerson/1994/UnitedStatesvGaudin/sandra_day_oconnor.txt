if
you
were
deciding
it
as
an
original
proposition
it
would
make
sense
to
say
it
was
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
prosecutions
under
1001
does
it
depend
at
all
on
what
the
issue
is?
if
it
made
a
difference
what
the
government
agent
actually
thought
about
the
form
in
question,
that
seems
pretty
factually
related.
i
mean,
how
important
was
it
to
that
official
that
an
answer
be
thus
and
so?
justice
sandra

o'connor
mr.
dreeben,
now,
the
defendant
below
did
not
object
to
the
instruction
that
was
given
saying
it
was
a
question
of
law,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
the
lower
courts
treated
it
as
a
matter
of
plain
error.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
that
any
so
called
winship
type
error
is
always
plain
error?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
should
this
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
don't
quarrel
with
our
resolution
of
it
on
the
merits.
