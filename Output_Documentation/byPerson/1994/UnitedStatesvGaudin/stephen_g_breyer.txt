stephen
g.

well,
the...
couldn't
you
say
the
same
as...
in
a...
as
a
matter
of
relevance
to
a
perjury
conviction?
the...
in
a
perjury
trial?
there
was
another
trial
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
this
judge
now
doesn't
look
to
what
actually
would
have
affected
the
jury.
rather,
this
judge
now
looks
to
the
circumstances
of
the
prior
trial
and,
given
his
knowledge
as
a
judge
and
what
usually
affects
juries,
whether
or
not
it
would
have
done,
it
says,
this
is
relevant
or
not.
now
here,
i
think
the
government
is
saying,
but
i'm
not
positive,
that
materiality
in
respect
to
a
government
program
is
roughly
the
same.
the
judge
goes,
reads
the
statute
books,
finds
out
the
nature
of
the
program,
and
on
the
basis
of
how
the
program
works
and
how
it's
supposed
to
work,
works
out
whether
or
not
this
statement
would
likely
have
affected
the...
not
what
it
really
would.
the
psychology
of
the
individual
lending
officer
is
beside
the
point,
but
basically
it
calls
upon
the
knowledge
of
the
judge
to
understand
government
programs
in
the
same
way
that
a
perjury
prosecution
calls
upon
the
knowledge
of
the
second
judge
to
understand
how
the
first
trial
worked,
and
it's
in
that
sense
i
think
that
they
seem
quite
similar.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
you
see
judges
are
not
only
experts
on
court
proceedings.
they're
also
experts
on
how
regulatory
programs
work,
how
statute
books
work,
how
when
you
understand...
that's
a
fairly
close
analogy.
i
mean,
i'm
honestly
not
certain
about
this
case,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
quite
a
strong
analogy,
given
the
history
and
so
forth,
but
that's
why
i'm
interested
in
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
it's
fact,
but
it's
certain
facts
about
how
programs
work
based
upon
your
knowledge
of
statutes,
regulatory
things,
rather
than
what
actually
influences,
just
as
relevance
is
fact.
the
relevance
of
something
that
the
second
judge
has
to
decide
about
grows
out
of
the
facts
of
the
first
trial.
the
judge
in
the
second
trial
has
to
put
himself
back
in
that
situation.
that's
where
i'm
finding
the
analogy,
and
the
words,
fact
and
law,
don't
help
very
much,
because
i'm
prepared
to
say
that
both
involve
facts
or
law
or
whatever
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
wouldn't
we
have
to...
why...
just
overrule
all
the
relevance,
because
relevance
in
a
prior
trial
might
well
involve
a
host
of
factual
matters.
what
would
in
those
circumstances
have
proved
to
have
been
relevant
might
depend
on
what
might
have
been
admitted
later
on.
i
mean,
you
can
easily
construct...
so
i
guess
the
relevance
to
would
be
out
the
window,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
posner
makes
that
distinction,
but
i'm
not
certain
i
get
the
clarity
of
the
distinction.
