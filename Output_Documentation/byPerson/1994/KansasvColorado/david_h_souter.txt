justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
saying
that
if
they
had
followed
the
principles
there
would
have
been
another
11,000
acre
feet
in
the
river,
it
had
to
go
somewhere,
and
kansas
is
where
it
would
have
gone,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
even
though
the
record
is
agnostic
with
respect
to
measurements
at
the
state
line,
you're
saying
there
would
have
been
another
11,000
that
went
into
the
river,
and
it
had
to
go
to
us,
and
so
therefore
we
must
have
lost
it.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
you
don't
depend
on
the
argument
that
you
said
was
your
argument
in
response
to
my
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
technically,
you
don't
care,
for
the
sake
of
the
argument,
what
happened
to
the
11,000
gallons.
what
you
care
about
is
the
proposition
that
if
the
principles
are
violated,
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
tantamount
to
a
measurable
depletion.
that's
what
you
really
care
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
definition,
and
it
didn't
occur
to
me
that
i
had
this
question
before,
but
when
you
speak...
when
you
use
the
term,
material
depletion,
does
that
term
refer
solely
to
volume
of
water,
without
any
reference
to
the
capacity
of
the
recipient
of
that
water
to
use
it
beneficially?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
merely
a
change
in
acre
feet.
justice
david
h.
souter
where
do
you
go
to
enforce
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
they
had
been
adopted
by
the
states,
would
it
be
operative
without
ratification
by
congress?
would
it
have
taken
separate
ratification
if
it
was
a
state
agreement?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
does
that
go
to
the
violation
or
simply
to
damages?
isn't
there
a
violation
if
there
is,
in
fact,
a
material
depletion?
there
may
be
no
damage
remedy
unless
there
is
a
further
showing
that
usable...
that
the
usable
quantities
were
reduced,
too,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
i
want
to
get
this
straight.
i
misunderstood
your
earlier
answer,
because
i
thought
your
earlier
answer
was
that
material
depletion
referred
simply
to
quantity,
not
to
usable
quantity,
and
i
think
you're
now
saying
the
opposite,
and
i
want
to
know
which
it
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
were
too
subtle
for
me.
help
me
out.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
it's
not
just
quantity.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
agree--
--now--
--that
all
of
this
can
be
litigated
in
the
district
court
if
somebody
wants
to
litigate
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
standard
of
proof
would
be
clear
and
convincing
even
when
there
has
been
a
decree
and
the
issue
is
whether
it's
been
violated?
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
isn't...
is
that
going
to
be
a
difficult
question?
i
mean,
i
understand
the
argument.
i
guess
i
agree
with
it
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof
prior
to
the
establishment
of
a...
of
liability,
but
after
there
has
been
a
decree,
the
truth
is
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
or
states,
in
fact,
bound
by
the
decree
has
already
been
compromised.
i
mean,
they
have
already,
subject
to
this
higher
burden,
been
made
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
and
a
degree
entered,
and
once
the
sovereignty
is
no
longer
pristine,
if
you
will,
why
should
the
burden
of
proof
be
different
from
what
it
would
be
for
any
normal
litigant
who
has
lost
and
who
is
charged
with
having
violated
a
decree?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
disruption
theoretically
has
occurred
by
the
decree.
the
only
question
is
the
enforcement
of
the
decree,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
does
not
implicate
the
same
sort
of
disruption
in
settled
usage.
the
assumption
is
a
different
one,
that
the
usage
ought
to
be
according
to
the
decree.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i...
you're
that
there
is
certain
evidence
which
does
not
carry
with
it
a
high
probative
value,
and
it
seems
to
me
you
can
make
out
a
perfectly
good
case
for
that,
whether
you're
talking
about
a
preponderance
standard
or
a
clear
and
convincing
standard.
you're
saying,
this
isn't
good
enough
to
get
you
across
the
line
for
preponderance.
just
because
you
have
an
overall
preponderance
standard,
i
don't
think
it
means
that
you
let
in
a
study
if,
you
know,
its
51
percent
chance
is
that
it's
accurate.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
different
question,
if
i
may.
if
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
once
there
has
been
a
decree
the
burden
of
proof
for
someone
claiming
a
violation
is
a
preponderance,
not
clear
and
convincing...
we're
going
to
make
that
distinction.
clear
and
convincing
in
order
to
get
a
decree.
after
a
decree,
proof
of
violation
may
be
made
by
a
preponderance.
assuming
that,
would
it
make
good
consistent
sense
to
say,
preponderance
should
also
be
the
standard
when
there
is
a
claim
of
violation
of
a
compact?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
utility
of
recognizing
a...
let's
say
a
proof
of
vague
violation
when
it's
simply
going
to
lead
to
damages
and
the
vagueness
there
is
going
to
preclude
a
reliable
damage
remedy?
