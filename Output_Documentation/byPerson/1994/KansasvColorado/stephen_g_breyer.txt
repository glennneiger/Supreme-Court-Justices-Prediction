justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the...
what
do
you
rely...
as
i
understand
it,
though
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
answer
to
justice
scalia,
that
you
say
that
they
violated
the
procedures,
these
procedures.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
then
the
issue...
and
if
they
violated
the
procedures,
then
they
violated
the
compact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
other
side
says,
you're
right,
as
long
as
there
was
a
material
depletion
of
the
water
available
to
kansas,
and
you
think
that's
shown
automatically
by
the
fact
they
violated
the
procedures,
and
they
don't.
so
that's
my
understanding
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
that's
correct,
then
what
is
it
that
shows
that
automatically
violating
these
procedures
would
violate
the
compact,
without
some
further
showing
of
what
physically
happened
in
terms
of
availability
of
water
to
kansas?
what
is
it
that
shows
it
automatically?
the
best
think
that
i
thought
you
pointed
to
is
this
thing
about
a
letter
to
the
governor
of
kansas
from
mr.
dugan.
is
that
the
best
thing
for
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
i
had
with
that
letter,
which
is
what
i'm
getting
to,
is
it
says
that
if
they
don't
violate
the...
if
they
don't
violate
the
procedures,
they
won't
materially
deplete
the
flow.
isn't
that
what
it
says?
if
you
don't
violate
the
procedures...
what
i
have
is,
the
proposed
project
will
not
materially
deplete
the
water
if
it's
operated
under
the
guidelines.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
not
deplete--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right,
but
it
doesn't
say
what
will
happen
if
you
don't
comply
with
the
procedures.
it
leaves
it
up
in
the
air.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
then
if
that's
true,
then
what
is
it
that
you
have
to
prove
that
if
you
do
violate
the
procedures,
that
automatically
depletes
the
flow,
or
at
least
the
parties
thereby
agreed
to
that,
and
i
couldn't
find
anything
in
here
that
said
that
they
did
agree
to
that
automatic--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
that
may
be
true...
assume
it's
true.
they
had
procedures,
the
procedures
bind
them,
it's
all
part
of
a
deal,
but
don't
you
have
to
show
that
they
also
agreed
that's
part
of
this
deal
that
if
we
violate
the
procedures,
that
fact
in
and
of
itself
demonstrates
a
material
depletion?
it's
that
part
that
i
thought
the
special
master
didn't
agree
with
you
about.
maybe
you
did
violate
the
procedures.
then
go
work
out
some
deal
for
that,
but
have
you
automatically
shown
a
material
depletion
without
showing
what
happened
physically,
and
where
is
the
agreement
to
that,
that
the
violation
of
the
procedures
automatically
shows
a
material
depletion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
you
could
read
to
me
that
would
suggest
it
was
inherent
in
the
principles?
i
read
that
letter...
or
i
mean,
i
don't
want
you
to...
if
something
comes
immediately
to
mind,
or
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
what
people...
am
i
right
that
it's
the
trinidad
project
operating
principles,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
and
then
if
the
water
leaves
trinidad,
it
goes
to
the
john
martin
reservoir,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
maybe
this
11,000
feet,
or
i
don't
know
what
that
number
came
from,
but
it
would
go
down
to
the
john
martin
reservoir,
and
maybe
people
had
enough
water
anyway
in
the
john
martin
reservoir,
so
whether
they
had
11,000
or
not
11,000
didn't
make
any
difference
to
kansas
in
terms
of
what
happened
in
the
past.
i
mean,
is
all
this
explored
in
the
record?
i
had
the
impression
that
you
were
virtually
conceding
that
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
these
operating
principles
automatically
show
a
violation
thereof
is
a
violation
of
the
compact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
is
also,
you
have...
to
prevail
on
laches
you
have
to
show
you're
prejudiced
and
there,
i
take
it,
there
was
evidence,
and
the
master
went
through
it,
and
he
said,
well,
even
if
kansas
should
have
complained
sooner,
it
didn't
hurt
colorado,
because
colorado
would
have
had
to
collect,
i
guess,
this
data
of
what
was
being
pumped
out
of
wells
very
early,
years
and
years
and
years
ago,
and
you'd
have
to
speculate
that
if
they
had
complained
sooner,
colorado
would,
in
fact,
have
collected
this
data
sooner,
and
i
can't
tell,
says
the
master,
and
i
don't
find
any
prejudice.
so
there
was
a
finding
on
that
prejudice
part--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
he
said
you'd
have
to
speculate
in
order
to
support
you.
he
has...
he
lists
the
two
witnesses
who
died,
he
lists
the
hydrological
survey,
he
lists
all
kinds
of
stuff.
didn't
sound
like
speculation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
said
it's
highly
speculative
that
they
would
have
done.
