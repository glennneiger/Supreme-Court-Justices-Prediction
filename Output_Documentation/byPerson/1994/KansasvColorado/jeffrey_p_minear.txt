mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
the
issues
in
the
order
that
they
are
presented
in
our
brief.
first,
the
master
correctly
resolved
the
trinidad
claim.
kansas
has
predicated
that
claim
on
the
theory
that
trinidad
operations
have
breached
the
compact,
but
the
only
relevant
limitation
that
the
compact
imposes
on
new
projects
like
trinidad
is
that
they
cannot
materially
deplete
usable
flows.
kansas
has
made
no
showing
that
trinidad
has
had
that
effect.
instead,
kansas
has
attempted
to
show
that
colorado
has
allowed
a
local
irrigation
district
to
violate
reservoir
operating
principles,
but
those
operating
principles
are
not
a
part
of
the
compact,
and
hence
their
violation
cannot
establish
a
violation
of
the
compact.
simply
put,
kansas
cannot
predicate
its
compact
action
based
on
conduct
that
the
compact
does
not
forbid.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
believe
an
action
could
conceivably
be
brought
based
on
the
operating
principles
in
another
forum.
whether
it
would
be
the
district
court
or
a
state
court
would
depend
on
the
parties
that
are
bringing
the
suit.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
state
has
a
problem
here.
i
do
think
that
the
state's
best
argument
here
is
a
compact
violation
based
on
a
material
depletion
of
the
usable
flows.
if
there's
been
no
material
depletion
of
usable
flows,
they're
going
to
encounter
a
standing
objection
wherever
they
raise
the
claim
later
on.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
agree
with
the
special
master
it
did
not.
the
special
master
canvassed
the
records
and
he
concluded
that
there
was
no
showing
that
the
parties,
or
the
compact
administration
itself,
viewed
this
as
a
regulation
of
the
compact.
instead,
what
had
happened
here
was
the
bureau
of
reclamation
had
formulated
these
operating
principles
in
anticipation
of
the
completion
of
construction
of
the
trinidad
project.
they
circulated
the
operating
principles
to
interested
parties
to
see
if
they
agreed
with
the
operating
principles.
the
compact
administration
was
included
among
those
parties
that
they
consulted,
but
that
was
simply
a
consultation
method...
measure,
and
nothing
more.
the
master
also
correctly
concluded
that
kansas
had
failed
to
prove
its
winter
water
storage
claim.
the
master
carefully
examined
the
evidence,
he
discerned
numerous
serious
problems
with
the
kansas
water
model,
and
he
concluded
that
kansas
had
failed
to
show
that
the
winter
water
storage
program
had
caused
material
state
line
depletions.
the
record
fully
supports
that
conclusion.
kansas
seeks
to
overcome
the
master's
finding
by
arguing
that
colorado
should
bear
the
burden
of
disproving
kansas'
allegations.
that
argument,
however,
is
inconsistent
with
the
hornbook
rule
that
the
plaintiff,
the
party
that
seeks
to
alter
the
status
quo,
bears
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
would
be
our
view--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
is
our
view
that
it
would
make
sense
to
employ
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
in
this
situation.
the
reason
we
reach
that
conclusion
is
because
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
applies
in
actions
between
the
states
in
other
interstate
disputes,
most
frequently
in
actual
apportionment
measures,
and
the
factors
that
lead
to
the
application
of
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
namely
the
sensitive
nature
of
litigation
between
states,
and
also
the
disruptive
effect
of
disturbing
settled
water
uses,
both
call
for
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
to
make
sure
that
there
is
not
a
mistake.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
the
court...
this...
i
think
you're
speaking
to
the
1993
decision
in
nebraska
v.
wyoming,
and
in
that
case
the
court
noted
that
a
party
does
not
need
to
prove
injury
in
order
to
enforce
a
decree.
you
need
only
show
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
decree
itself,
but
the
court
did
not
speak
to
the
question
of
the
burden
of
proof,
or
the
standard
of
proof
in
that
situation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
take
the
position
that
it
should
be
the
same,
because
otherwise
you're
going
to
encounter
difficulties
in
litigating--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--these
cases
and
determining
which
standard
would
apply.
often--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--again,
we're
looking
to
what
the
court's
precedents
say,
and
the
other
factor
that
the
court
looked
at
was
the
disruptive
effect
of
disrupting
settled
water
uses.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that,
because
the
problem
here
is
really
one
of
the
question
of
the
level
of
confidence
you
have
with
respect
to
the
factual
findings
that
are
made,
and
this
case
nicely
illustrates
that.
the
kansas
model
here
had
numerous
serious
problems.
there's
no
doubt
that
everyone
was
concerned
through
the
course
of
travel
about
the
accuracy
of
its
predictions,
and
nevertheless,
the
results
of
relying
on
that
model
could
be
very
serious
for
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
this
does
go
to
the
standard
of
proof,
though,
whether
or
not,
to
what
degree
of
confidence
the
court
has
in
its
staff
findings.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
i
think
as
the
court
said
in
colorado
v.
new
mexico
that
the
question
of
the
standard
of
proof
does
go
to
the
level
of
confidence
the
court
brings
to
bear--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--with
respect
to
the
whole
case.
to
the
whole--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--why
would
this
case
settle--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
fact
in
the
colorado
v.
new
mexico
case,
it
was
just
the
opposite.
it
was
the
upstream
state
that
was
burdened
by
the
clear
and
convincing
standard.
it
was
colorado
with
respect
to
the
navajo
river
that
was
burdened
in
that
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
in
any
event,
i
think
that
the
question
here
really
is
a
question
of
consistency,
whether
or
not
you
think
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
one
single
standard
should
apply
when
there
are
actions
between
the
states,
or
whether
you
wish
to
switch
back
and
forth
between
the
standards.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
would
think
that
the
enforcement...
the
principle
that
you
apply
to
the
enforcement
of
a
decree
should
apply
to
the
enforcement
of
the
compact
as
well.
those
two...
the
compact
operates
very
similar
to
a
decree
in
terms
of--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
absolutely
right.
the
special
master
noted
that
the...
under
any
standard
of
proof
his
conclusions
would
have
been
the
same.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
are
not
actually
supporting
colorado
directly
on
laches.
we
have
simply
made
the
observation
that
this
court
in
the
past
has
taken
into
account
equitable
considerations
such
as
laches,
waiver,
and
acquiescence,
in
resolving
claims.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
would
say
that
the
different
principles
have
been
recognized
with
respect
to
litigation
involving
the
united
states.
generally,
laches
has
not
been
recognized
in
suits
between
a
private
party
against
the
united
states,
because
of
the
nature
of
a
private
sovereign
dispute.
here,
where
you
have
a
dispute
where
there
are
sovereigns
on
each
side,
the
court
has
shown
a
willingness
to
consider
laches
and
acquiescence
and
those
such
factors
at
least
as
respect
to
the
remedy
that
would
be
provided.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
that
is
correct.
i
believe
the
special
master
cited
to
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
our
belief
is
that
it
would
not
foreclose
a
claim
completely,
but
nevertheless,
it
would
affect
the
remedy
that
would
be
involved.
