mr.
david
w.
robbins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
colorado
similarly
supports
the
master's
report,
but
has
taken
four
exceptions
to
the
report.
i
would
first
like
to
address
some
comments
to
the
court
concerning
the
kansas
argument.
i
wish
to
make
it
clear
that
the
master
did
not
make
a
finding
on
the
amount
of
actionable
depletion
as
to
the
post
compact
wells
in
colorado.
counsel's
description
of
the
amounts
of
depletion
when
he
was
discussing
how
full
the
courtroom
might
be,
or
how
many
times
it
might
fill,
were
strictly
kansas'
allegations
at
the
close
of
the
evidence
in
this
case.
second,
with
regard
to
trinidad,
kansas
sought
to
use
article
iv-d
to
show
a
material
depletion.
however,
it
admittedly
did
not
show
that
there
was
a
material
depletion
to
state
line
flows.
remember,
article
iv-d
is
designed
to
permit
additional
beneficial
development
in
both
states
of
the
unused
water,
and
it
is
colorado's
position,
and
it
was
the
master's
determination,
that
kansas
had
to
show
that
there
was,
in
fact,
a
material
depletion
to
the
water
that
would
otherwise
be
available
to
kansas.
simply
showing
that
operating
principles
had
been
violated...
and
i
wish
to
point
out,
operating
principles
that
were
negotiated
not
between
the
state
of
colorado
and
the
state
of
kansas
but
between
the
purgatoire
river
water
conservancy
district,
a
governmental
entity
within
colorado,
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
and
the
state
of
kansas,
principles
which
were
then
subsequently
submitted
to
the
administration
for
their
imprimatur,
or
approval.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
there
are
two...
there
are...
if
i
may,
there
are
two
concepts
that
are
important
here.
the
first
one
is
material
depletion,
which
refers
to
a
depletion
as
a
volume
of
water.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
the
compact
negotiators
in
the
compact
negotiations
discuss
this,
and
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
a
change
in
colorado
that
was
not
terribly
significant
did
not
trigger
litigation.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
it
was
a...
what
they
were
concerned
about
was,
if
you
simply
use
the
term,
depletion,
kansas
and
colorado
might
be
here
every
year
arguing
about
some
small
glitch,
and
you
must
remember
that
this
is
a
river
that
has
average...
that
has
flow
conditions
that
on
the
average
are
a
number
of,
you
know,
600,000
or
800,000
acre
feet,
but
rise
into
the
millions
and
drop
into
the
200,000
and
300,000
each
year,
so
you
have
this
huge
variability
in
the
system,
and
they
didn't
want
us
here
all
the
time
arguing
about
little
numbers,
so
material
depletion
was
intended
to
cover
that.
secondly,
there
is
the
concept
of
usability.
it
was
important
to
the
framers
of
the
compact
that
waters
be
usable
in
each
of
the
states
if
there
was
to
be
a
call,
or
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
demand
on
john
martin
reservoir.
the
idea
was
that
there
was
water,
as
the
compact
was
negotiated,
passing
garden
city,
kansas,
unused,
and
they
wanted
to
be
certain
that
that
water
was
developable
in
each
state.
they
didn't
want
to
have
a
situation
where
kansas
was
making
insistence
upon
colorado
for
water
when
in
fact
they
had
supplies
within
kansas
passing
unusable
out
of
the
area
covered
by
the
compact.
the
procedures...
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
the
procedures
that
were
approved,
that
were
included
within
this
agreement
among
the
district,
the
bureau,
and
kansas,
approved
by
the
compact,
not
pursuant
to
rules
and
regs
authority
inherent
in
the
compact
but
simply
approved
as
a
resolution,
those
procedures
did
not
prescribe
daily
operation
for
trinidad
reservoir.
they
were
based
upon
bureau
of
reclamation
studies
that
dealt
with
averages.
next.
the
state
engineer
of
colorado
did,
in
fact,
terminate
by
order
the
aggrieved
use
of
the
operating
principles,
the
allegation
that
those
principles
weren't
being
followed.
that
order
is
in
effect
today.
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
to
assume
that
it
will
not
remain
in
effect.
colorado
is
not
in
the
business
of
seeking
to
violate
its
agreements.
in
response
to
justice
scalia,
the
parties
did
not
treat
the
procedures
as
being
part
of
the
compact.
in
fact,
as
far
as
the
state
of
colorado
was
concerned,
they
were
in
agreement
among
three
parties
that
it
was
brought
to
the
compact
in
colorado
because
kansas
requested
approval
by
the
commission,
voted
aye
that
those
procedures
should,
in
fact,
be
approved
by
the
compact
and
utilized.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
my
judgment
would
be
that
you
would
go
to
enforce
them
in
the
district
court,
bringing
in
the
parties
to
the
agreement,
namely,
the
purgatoire
district,
the
bureau,
and
the
entities
which
are,
in
fact,
operating
the
project.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
they
also
joined
the
colorado
state
engineer,
who
was
the
appropriate
water
official.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
that
would
be
my
interpretation.
that's
correct,
sir.
there's
no
administrative
agency
that
really
is
involved
in
this.
you
have
a
federal
agency
that
built
and
manages
the
project,
you
have
a
colorado
entity,
the
district,
whose
water
rights
were
the
rights,
the
interests
that
were
brought
into
the
reservoir
that
are
being
managed,
you
have
the
state
of
kansas,
that
sought
the
operating
principles--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--well,
the
compact
administration
received
a
complaint
from
kansas
under
article
viii-h,
which
was
the
investigation
section
of
the
compact,
seeking
to
obtain
an
investigation
by
the
administration
of
those
procedures,
and
that
investigation
was,
in
fact,
approved.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
mr.
justice
scalia,
i
jumped
over
myself.
there
is
an
administrative
procedure
before
the
compact.
however,
if
you
had
been
dissatisfied
with
how
those
procedures
were
operated,
you
were
entitled,
in
my
opinion,
to
take
the
matter
to
a
district
court.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
they've
no
authority
to
do
anything
about
the
procedures
unless
it
is
there...
unless
they
find
that
there
is
a
material
depletion,
and
their
authority
comes
in
through
material
depletion,
not
through
those
operating
principles.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
i
do
not
believe
that
the
administration
has
authority
to
order
the
change
in
those
procedures.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
well,
the
parties
to
the
agreement,
one
of
the
major
parties
to
the
agreement
is
not
here
before
you,
and
that's
the
purgatoire
district,
one
of
the
entities
that
gave
up
its
members,
agreed
to
the
subordination
or
use
of
its
water
rights
within
this,
pool
and
made
that
agreement
in
part
through
these
operating
principles.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
the
violation
needs
to
be
a
material
depletion
under
article
iv-d.
i
do
not
want
the
court
to
assume
for
one
minute
that
simply
by
not...
you
have
to
wrap
these
procedures,
mr.
justice
stevens,
into
the
compact.
they
don't
just--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--had
those
procedures
been
adopted
pursuant
to
viii-b,
you're
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
they
were
simply
approved
by
the
two
states.
they
were
not
adopted
pursuant
to
an
agreement
by
the
two
states.
the
principles
were
adopted
by
the
purgatoire
district,
the
bureau,
and
the
state
of
kansas.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
if
the
purpose
was
to
modify
the
way
in
which
the
compact's
no
material
depletion
standard
was
applied,
yes,
it
would.
i'd
like
to
move
on,
if
i
might,
to
colorado's
exception,
which
involves
the
defense
of
laches.
colorado
does
not
argue,
and
i
want
to
make
this
clear,
that
kansas
should
be
estopped
from
obtaining
prospective
relief
under
the
arkansas
compact.
however,
colorado
believes
that
this
court
should
consider
laches
for
any
well-pumping
occurred...
that
occurred
prior
to
1985.
in
response
to
the
position
stated
in
the
kansas--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--as
far
as
prospective
relief,
your
honor?
mr.
david
w.
robbins
damages
in
money
or
water
for
past...
any
past
depletions
that
are
found
to
violate
usable
flow,
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
the
master
did
not
find
a
quantity
of
water.
he
simply
said
that
from
all
of
the
evidence
he
believed
that
there
was,
in
fact,
a
violation
of
article
iv-d
of
the
compact
based
upon
first
compact
well-pumping
in
colorado.
he
did
not
quantify
that
amount.
that
is
left
for
a
subsequent
phase
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
prospectively?
mr.
david
w.
robbins
well,
i
think
the
prospective
relief
would
have
to
wait,
but
that
would
be
one
facet
of
the
relief.
kansas
is
entitled
to
one--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--well,
laches
would
cover
past
relief.
we
are
not
arguing
for
estoppel,
which
would
seek
to
prevent
kansas
from
enforcing
the
compact
in
the
future
based
upon
their
acquiescence
in
the
past
activity.
we're
simply--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--i
believe
that
there
are
cases,
your
honor,
that
are
in
the
patent
area
in
particular
where
that
is
exactly
how
laches
is
applied,
and
there
is
the
analysis
in
those
cases...
they
are
cited
in
our
brief...
in
which
a
patent
holder
fails
to
enforce
his
patent
over
a
period
of
time,
then
identifies
the
problem,
and
very
often,
in
at
least
the
circuit
court
decisions,
there
is
language
to
the
effect
that
the
enforcement
can
occur
prospectively,
but
as
to
claims
for
damages
or
recovery
for
past
activities,
they
are
barred.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
it
depends--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--on
the
facts
of
the
case.
now,
the
point
i'd
like
to
make
with
regard
to
the
kansas
position
is
that
in
its
reply
brief
to
the
court
at
pages
8,
and
again
at
19,
it
states
that
it
had
no
knowledge
or
reason
to
know,
before
1984,
that
pumping
in
colorado
was
violating
the
terms
of
the
compact,
and
i
would...
however,
i
would
direct
the
court
to
an
earlier
position
taken
by
kansas.
i
refer
to
the
march
4,
1986
reply
brief
filed
by
kansas
with
this
court
in
support
of
the
bill
of
complaint
at
page
10,
and
i
would
like
to
quote:
"the
implication
colorado
offers
the
court
is
that
kansas
has
sat
on
its
hands,
idly
watching
the
state
line
flows
decline
over
the
years.
"
"the
actual
history
is
quite
the
contrary.
"
"as
early
as
its
meeting
on
december
11,
1956,
the
administration
held
considerable
discussion
concerning
the
activity
of
well-drilling
and
its
effect
on
conditions.
"
"since
then,
well
depletion
has
been
discussed,
both
formally
and
informally,
at
numerous
meetings
of
the
compact
administration.
"
mr.
david
w.
robbins
no,
sir,
this
is
a
statement
of
counsel
in
the
brief
supporting
the
bill
of
complaint
in
this
case.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
the
master...
yes.
the
master
found--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--the
master
acknowledged
that
laches
was
an
appropriate
remedy
in
proceedings
of
this
sort.
kansas
introduced
no
evidence
to
suggest
why
the
delay
occurred.
they
relied
solely
upon
the
position
that
laches
did
not
apply
to
a
sovereign,
period.
the
master
in
part
speculated
that
kansas
was
relying
upon
colorado's
efforts,
which
are
replete
in
the
record,
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
well-pumping
depletion,
but
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect.
it
is
just
that,
speculation,
because
kansas
did
not
introduce
any
evidence
at
all.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
justice
breyer--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--that
is
correct,
but
the
master's
finding
is
again
based
upon
speculation,
because--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--he
says
colorado
would
not
have
collected
the
data...
would
not
have
collected
the
data
had
it
been
given
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
that's
correct,
but
that
flies
in
the
face
of
all
of
the
studies
that
were
done
in
the
state
of
colorado
during
this
period
seeking
to
collect
that
very
sort
of
data,
and
it
suggests,
without
any
opportunity
for
colorado
to
respond,
suggests
that
somehow
colorado
would
not
have
intensified
its
efforts
to
collect
data
if
it
knew
it
was
on
the
griddle,
but
colorado
didn't
know
it
was
on
the
griddle.
kansas
knew
throughout
this
period,
as
the
two
witnesses,
one
kansas
and
one
colorado,
suggest.
one
kansas
witness
said
in
1956
i
was
sent
into
colorado
to
look
at
wells
because
of
depletions
in
state
line
flows
for
the...
counsel
says,
we
operated,
throughout
this
period
we
were
continually
talking
about
this
problem
but
no
complaint
was
filed.
the
master
says
that
he
speculates
that
colorado
wouldn't
have
done
it
anyway,
but
the
facts
to
my
mind
suggest
quite
to
the
contrary.
the
state
of
colorado
consistently
worked
with
the
gs
throughout
this
period
trying
to
get
a
handle
on
this
very
problem,
and
there's
no
reason
to
speculate
that
if
the
state
in
this
compact
had
said,
we
wish
an
investigation
under
the
compact
into
the
impacts
of
wells,
that
it
would
not
have
redoubled
its
efforts.
without
that
complaint,
it
was
already
trying
to
do
that.
so
in
our
view
you
have
the
state
of
kansas
at
the
commencement
of
this
proceeding
acknowledging
that
it
knew
and
that
it
talked
about
this
issue
as
it
went
along.
it
also
acknowledged
in
its
reply
brief
that
it
in
fact
did
nothing
until
1984-1985
about
it.
so
you
have,
by
kansas,
admissions
on
both
of
the
important
issues
here,
and
the
next
issue
is
only
prejudice,
and
to
our
view,
the
fact
that
we
lost
the
opportunity
to
inquire
of
the
usgs
person
who
did
the
important
study
in
the
1960's
and
who
came
up
with
the
estimates
of
1940
pumping,
which
had
an
adverse
consequence
to
us
when
it
came
time
to
deal
with
post
compact
or
precompact
pumping.
we
weren't
able
to
defend
ourselves
in
that
regard
because
we
couldn't
get
an
explanation
of
how
the
1940
through
1949
numbers
were
derived.
we
were
unable
to
get
power
coefficients
or
power
records.
all
of
the
witnesses
in
the
case,
kansas
and
colorado
and
the
united
states,
acknowledge
that
in
these
early
periods
there
was
effectively
no
hard
data.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
colorado's
witnesses,
justice
o'connor,
said
that--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
the
answer
is
yes.
now,
i'd
like
to
explain
that
colorado
has
conceded
that
there
were
reductions
in
state
line
flow,
but
i
want
to
go
back
to
my
response
about
usable
flow.
my
answer,
yes,
is
qualified
that
we
have
not
had
a
quantification
of
depletion
to
usable
state
line
flow,
which
is--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--that's
not
correct--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--in
my
interpretation,
justice
souter.
i
believe
that
the
violation
is
a
material
depletion
to
usable
flows,
because
excess
flows
could
be
fully
depleted
in
one
state
or
the
other
without
there
being
a
violation.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
i...
what
i
tried
to
do
earlier--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--material
depletion
relates
to
depletions
to
usable
flow,
and
i
tried
to
explain
the
two
concepts.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
that's
correct.
it's
quantity...
it's
depletion
to
usable
quantity.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
