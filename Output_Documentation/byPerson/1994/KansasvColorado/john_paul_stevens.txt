justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
curious,
when
you
talk
about
the
courtroom,
are
you
assuming
it's
full
to
the
ceiling,
or
just
a
foot?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
that's
the
first
time
i've
seen
that
comparison
before.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
are
these
violations
of
the
procedures
ongoing,
or
have
they
been
terminated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
has
it
not
been
determined
that
there
were
violations,
so
doesn't
that
mean
they
will
cease
in
the
future,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
has
been
a
determination,
has
there
not,
that
there
were
violations
of
the
procedures,
and
does
it
therefore
not
follow
that
they
will
be
discontinued
in
the
future?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also
that
they've
been
terminated,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
where
do
you
go
from
that...
supposing
you're
right,
and
we
agree
with
you.
what
remedy
would
be
appropriate?
assuming
there's
been
no
material
loss
of
water,
what's
the
remedy,
just
stop
violating?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
master
thought
that
this
letter
that
says
we're
not
going
to
do
it
any
more
is
sufficient,
would
you
then...
do
you
still
want
the
injunction?
but
it's...
the
only
question
is
whether
you
should
have
an
injunction
or
not.
there's
no...
they're
not
going
to
get
more
water,
or
anything
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
what
you're
in
fact
saying
that
had
they
followed
the
procedures,
you
would
have
gotten
more
water
than
the
original
compact
contemplated?
you
sort
of
didn't
get
the
full
benefit
that
you're
seeking.
is
that
what
it
boils
down
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
if
you
got
this
11,500
feet,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
wouldn't
be
a
benefit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
you're
right
that
they
could
go
to
the
district
court,
assuming
that
there
was
an
ongoing
violation,
why
couldn't
that
be
addressed
in
an
original
jurisdiction
case?
i
don't
quite
understand
why
it
can't
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
violation,
if
they're
right,
is
one
committed
by
colorado,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
let's
assume
there's
no
violation
of
iv-d,
would
you,
but
assume
there
is
a
violation
of
viii-b.
they
set
out
procedures
and
all
the
rest.
you're
saying
they
have
no
remedy
in
this
proceeding,
even
if
they
were...
that
you
just
said...
you
told
us
colorado
doesn't
disobey
its,
or
violate
its
promise.
supposing
colorado
took
a
position,
there's
nothing
you
can
do
about
it.
we're
going
to
follow
our
own
procedures
and
forget
about
what
we've
agreed
to.
you'd
say
there'd
be
no
remedy
in
this
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
were
not
adopted
pursuant
to
the
agreement
between
the
two
states?
