justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is
it
correct,
however,
that
you
made
no
effort
to
show
that
in
fact
it
reduced
the
flow
from
what
it
would
have
been
had
there
been
no
project
at
all?
is
that
an
accurate
enough
statement?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
draper,
what
has
the
practice
of
the
parties
been
under
the
agreement?
has
it,
in
fact,
been
the
arkansas
river
compact
administration
that
has
prescribed
procedures
for
the
administration
of
this
project?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
are
they
given
authority
to
prescribe
those
procedures
by
some
document
other
than
this
compact?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
that
sets
up
the
project
does
not
authorize
them
to
prescribe
procedures?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
fact,
it
would
seem
the
parties
have
behaved
as
though
article
viii-a
and
viii-b
does
consider
these
procedures
part
of
the
compact.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i...
as
i...
but
as
i
understand,
the
difficulty
is
it's
11,000
square
feet
more
than
would
have
been...
it's
the
difference
between
complying
with
the
procedures
for
this
reservoir
and
not
complying
with
the
procedures.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
the
difference
between
what
the
flow
would
have
been
without
the
reservoir
and
complying
with
the
procedures.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
nub
of
the
disagreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
no...
you
have
no
administrative
appeal.
you
go
right
to
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
compact
administration,
as
i
understand
you,
simply
approved
these
procedures
at
the
outset
and
has
had
nothing
more
to
do
with
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
sort
of
inconsistent
with
saying
that
they're
out
of
the
picture.
they
not
only
approved
the
procedures
at
the
outset,
but
they
have
been
exercising
some
supervisory
authority
over
the
implementation
of
those
procedures,
is
what
you're
telling
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
what's
the
authority
of
the
administration
to
do
anything
with
regard
to
those
procedures?
where
do
they
get
any
authority?
why
do
people
go
to
them
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
somebody
says
it's
being
operated
out
of
compliance
with
the
procedures,
you
don't
go
the
administration.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say
that
any
wells
that
went
up
with
knowledge
of
kansas
can
be
closed
down.
that's
future
relief,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
laches
would
extend
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
new
to
me.
i've
never
heard
that
laches
is
limited
that
way.
i
would
normally
think
that
when
somebody
has
done
something
for
a
long
time
and
you
haven't
made
any
complaint
about
it...
is
that
the
normal
operation
of
laches,
that
it
operates
only
as
to
past
damages,
not
as
to
future?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
even
if
i
have
built
up
a
whole
business
upon
that
misuse
of
the
patent,
which
is
a
very
small
part
of
my
entire
business,
but
nonetheless
essential
to
it,
in
the
future
i'd
have
to
close
down
the
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
brought
by
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
that
doesn't
have
to
do
with
the
burden
of
proof.
i
mean,
if
a
study
is
not
reliable,
it's
not
reliable.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
overall
case
is
a
preponderance
standard,
but
each
individual
item
of
evidence,
including
whether
you've
showed,
you
know,
a
particular
study
is
valid
or
not,
you
don't
let
it
in
if
the
chances
are
51-49
that
it's
valid.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
whole
case,
and
why
should
we
favor
downs...
upstream
states
all
the
time?
i
mean,
that's
what
happens
with
adopting
something
other
than
a
preponderance
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
you're
upstream,
the
downstream
state
has
to
show,
you
know,
beyond
a
reasonable...
let's
use
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
is
such
a
doctrine
in
international
law,
isn't
there,
in
public
international
law?
