chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
105
original,
kansas
v.
colorado.
mr.
draper.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
over
what
period
of
time
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
master
found
that
there
was
no
damage
in
effect
to
kansas
because
there
was
no
proof
that
the
flow
at
state
line
was
any
different,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--could
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
my
question
was,
didn't
the
master
find
that
there
was
no
appreciable
change
in
volume
of
flow
at
state
line?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then...
but
then
if
the
master
is
right,
and
it's
up
to
kansas
to
show
some
depletion
of
flow
at
the
state
line,
kansas
still
fails,
it
seems
to
me,
even
if
there's
no
showing
one
way
or
the
other,
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
kansas,
and
this
is
kansas'
lawsuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
there
was
no
change
in
the
flow
at
the
state
line,
how
do
you
know
there
was
such
a
deprivation,
and
where
did
it
take
place?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
there
was
no
showing
there
was
a
change
at
the
state
line.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
also...
there's
a
stretch
of
the
river
below
john
martin
reservoir
in
colorado.
couldn't
it
just
as
easily
have
come
from
additional
pumping
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
if
11,000
acre
feet
leaves
john
martin
reservoir,
an
additional
11,
that
11,000
necessarily
shows
up
at
the
state
line
when
the
river
flows
in
colorado
for
a
number
of
miles
above
the
state
line,
and
there
surely
could
have
been
either
pumping
or
diversion
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
draper.
mr.
robbins,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
difference
there,
mr.
robbins?
what
sort
of
relief
might
the
master
give
if
he
didn't
apply
laches
to
the
well-pumping
that
occurred
before
1985?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
so
what
is
the
kind
of
relief
you
think
should
be
barred
by
laches?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--this
is
a
witness?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
master
canvassed
all
these
facts,
the
arguments
pro
and
con
about
inexcusable
delay
on
the
part
of
kansas,
and
found
against
colorado
on
that,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why
should
we
overturn
that
finding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
really
don't
have
to
decide
this
question
of
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case,
do
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
draper,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
draper.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
the
number
105,
the
state
of
kansas
v.
the
state
of
colorado.
the
arkansas
river
rises
on
the
east
side
of
the
continental
divide
in
the
colorado
mountains
and
flows
at
a
steep
gradient
from
its
source
south
to
canon
city,
colorado,
whence
it
turns
east
and
it
flows
to
the
royal
gorge
and
then
descends
gradually
through
the
high
plains
of
eastern
colorado
and
western
kansas.
it
then
makes
a
great
bend
northward
through
kansas,
then
bend
south
again,
flows
through
oklahoma
and
arkansas
and
empties
into
the
mississippi
river
for
a
length
of
1450
miles.
this
river
is
unique
in
one
aspect.
its
pronunciation
changes
as
it
goes
from
state
to
state.
when
it
rises
in
colorado,
it’s
the
arkansas
river;
but
when
it
flows
through
kansas,
it’s
the
ar-kan-sas
river.
remember,
when
it
goes
through
oklahoma
and
arkansas,
it
goes
back
to
the
arkansas
river.
in
1949,
kansas
and
colorado
entered
into
a
compact
designed
to
apportion
the
waters
of
the
arkansas
river.
this
original
action
involves
the
dispute
among
kansas,
colorado
and
the
united
states
over
a
claimed
violations
of
the
arkansas
river
compact.
the
special
master
we
appointed
has
filed
a
report
detailing
his
findings
and
recommendations
regarding
the
alleged
violations
of
the
compact.
we
agree
with
the
special
mater’s
disposition
of
he
disputed
issues
and
we
overrule
kansas
and
colorado's
exceptions.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
