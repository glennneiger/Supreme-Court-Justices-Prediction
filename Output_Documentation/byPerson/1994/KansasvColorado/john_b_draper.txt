mr.
john
b.
draper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
kansas
is
here
this
morning
in
support
of
the
report
of
the
special
master
in
this
case
in
all
respects
except
for
three
points.
this
is
a
compact
enforcement
case.
it
seeks
enforcement
of
the
arkansas
river
compact
between
colorado
and
kansas.
it
is
a
federal
statute
approved
by
congress
and
signed
by
the
president
in
1949.
kansas
is
the
downstream
state,
colorado
is
the
upstream
state.
the
united
states
intervened
in
the
case
after
it
was
filed
as
federal
agencies
physically
perform
some
of
the
reservoir
functions
involved
in
the
kansas
claims.
physically,
colorado
diverts
ten
times
as
much
water
as
kansas
diverts
in
this
basin.
colorado
normally
diverts
all
of
the
inflows
to
the
basin
at
least
once,
and
in
most
cases
many
times,
before
those...
the
return
flows
from
those
diversions
reach
kansas.
kansas
depends
on
those
return
flows
and
on
the
benefits
of
john
martin
reservoir,
which
was
conducted
in
the
1940's
about
60
miles
above
the
state
line,
and
whose
benefits
are
apportioned
by
the
compact.
the
rights
of
kansas
under
the
compact
are
protected
by
article
iv-d
of
the
compact
which
forbids
material
depletions
of
the
waters
of
the
arkansas
river
in
usable
quantity
or
availability.
kansas
claims
three
violations
of
the
compact
have
occurred.
the
special
master
has
agreed
with
kansas
on
its
largest
claim
based
on
increased
post-compact
pumping
in
colorado.
that
violation
amounts
to
some
400,000
to
500,000
acre
feet
of
water.
as
the
volume
of
this
courtroom
is
about
3-1/3
acre
feet,
that
amounts
to
about
140,000
volumes
of
this
courtroom,
inside
the
pillars.
although
the
special
master
approved
that--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--this
is
over
the
study
period
of
1950
through
1985,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
second
claim
asserted
a
violation
based
on
the
colorado
winter
water
storage
program.
the
study
period
for
that
claim
is
1976
through
1985,
a
shorter
period.
kansas'
evidence
showed
a
depletion
over
that
period
of
40,000
acre
feet,
or
about
12,000
volumes
of
this
courtroom.
the
third
claim
is
based
on
the
operations
of
trinidad
reservoir
on
the
purgatoire
river,
a
major
tributary
of
the
arkansas
river
in
colorado.
the
amount
of
that
claim
was
11,000
acre
feet
over
a
period
1979
through
1984,
which
amounts
to
approximately
3,300
volumes
of
this
courtroom.
kansas
has
filed
three
exceptions
to
the
master's
report.
mr.
john
b.
draper
i'm
assuming
it's
full
right
to
the
ceiling,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
draper
the
state
of
kansas
has
filed
three
exceptions.
it
has
excepted
to
the
denial
of
the
winter
water
storage
program
claim
and
the
trinidad
claim
by
the
special
master.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
the
two
claims
are
quite
different
with
respect
to
the
answer
to
your
question.
with
respect
to
the
trinidad
reservoir
claim,
he
did
dismiss
the
kansas
case
at
the
end
of
its
evidence
for
failure
of
proof,
but
the
reason
was
that
he
believed
as
a
matter
of
law
that
kansas
had
proved
the
wrong
thing.
we
proved
that
colorado
had
violated
the
operating
principles
adopted
by
the
arkansas
river
compact
administration
for
the
operation
of
this
reservoir.
we
believe
that
the
adoption
by
the
compact
administration
of
principles
for
the
operations
of
the
reservoir
which
were
proposed
by
the
united
states
bureau
of
reclamation
set
the
standard
for
compliance
with
respect
to
that
project
under
the
compact.
mr.
john
b.
draper
we
don't
believe
that's
true,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
this
is
the
only
forum,
certainly
the
only
meaningful
forum,
in
which
we
can
press
a
claim
for
violation
of
the
operating
principles.
mr.
john
b.
draper
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
state
of
kansas
received
some
benefits
from
the
adoption
of
the
operating
principles
that
correspond
to
the
allowance
of
the
project
in
the
first
place,
which
was
being
held
up
until--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--kansas
gave
its
approval.
mr.
john
b.
draper
the
answer
is
that
it
is
sufficient,
in
our
view,
to
prove--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--he
did
at
least
suggest
that
strongly,
your
honor.
he
was
looking
at
evidence
which
was
developed
on
a
study
period
of
1925
to
1957,
however,
and
not
for
the
operation
period
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case,
which
is
1979
through
1984.
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
what
the
effect
of
the
departure
from
the
operating
principles
was
for
that
period.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
the
evidence
showed
that
the
departure
from
the
operating
principles,
which
we
believe
is
the
compliance
standard
for
this
project,
did
cause
depletions
of
waters
that
otherwise
would
have
gone
to
kansas.
the
inflows
to
john
martin
reservoir--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--that
is
technically
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
draper
it
does
not
mention
the
state
line,
your
honor,
just
flows
available
for
use
to
kansas
users,
and
during
the
study
period,
the
inflows
to
john
martin
reservoir
were
divided
40
percent
and
60
percent
between
the
two
states,
and
delivered
to
the
state
line
with
the
help
of
a
trans-loss
account
to
be
sure
that
the
flows
actually
reached
kansas.
this
was
also
the
standard
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
used
when
it
devised
the
operating
principles
in
1964
and
proposed
those
to
the
compacting
states.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that
is
an
accurate
statement,
your
honor.
we
show
that
there
was
a
depletion
of
flows
to
kansas,
usable
flows
to
kansas
as
a
result
of
the
departure
from
the
operating
principles.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
draper
we
don't
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
this
forum
is
the
only
meaningful
forum
that
we
have,
that
the
state
of
kansas
has
to
enforce
the
operating
principles.
it
is
basically
an
interstate
dispute,
and
interstate
disputes,
whether
they're
under
a
compact
or
not,
must
be
brought
in
this
forum.
mr.
john
b.
draper
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
draper
yes.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
draper
yes.
that
is
the
letter
that
immediately
preceded
the
adoption
of
the
operating
principles
by
the
compact
administration.
it
appears
in
our
brief
at
page
a-85.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that
letter
indicated
that
strict
compliance
with
the
operating
principles--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--would
achieve
compliance
with
the
compact.
mr.
john
b.
draper
literally,
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
statement
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation
and
the
operating
principles
themselves,
the
mandatory
language
that
is
contained
in
those,
in
the
preamble
and
in
every
operative
section
of
the
operating
principles,
indicates
that
these
are
intended
to
be
binding
in
nature,
and
that
they
form
the
standard
of
compact
compliance
for
that
particular
project.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
article
viii-b(2)
of
the
compact,
which
appears
on
page
3
of
our
blue
brief,
accords
the
administration...
that's
the
compact
administration...
the
power
to
prescribe
procedures
for
the
administration
of
this
compact,
and
by
the
proviso
of
that
provision,
it
makes
very
clear
that
those
are
proceedings--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--the
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
the...
there
is
no
difference
between
compliance
with
the
operating
principles
and
the
compact
itself
with
respect
to
this
project.
it
was
studied
by
the
u.s.
bureau
of
reclamation,
it
was
determined
what
was
necessary
in
order
to
comply
with
the
compact...
this
is
a
reservoir,
incidentally,
which
is
220
miles
above
the
state
line,
and
the
compact
administration
was
looking
at
the
question,
how
do
we
operate
this
project
on
a
day-to-day
basis?
do
we
have
the
gates
of
the
reservoir
open
today,
or
not,
or
how
long
do
we
keep
them
open?
we
have
down,
or
in
the
compact
itself
the
general
proviso
that
there
shall
be
no
depletion
of
usable
flows.
what
does
that
mean
in
terms
of
the
daily
operations,
and
that's
what
the
compact
administration
was
adopting
here,
were
the
exact
daily
operations
so
that
the
dam
tender
who
is
employed
by
the
federal
government
will
know
when
the
open
the
gates
and
when
to
close
them
at
this
project.
mr.
john
b.
draper
they
have
been
terminated
for
the
moment
by
a
letter
from
the
colorado
state
engineer,
the
highest
water
official
for
domestic
water
use
in
colorado,
that
until
the
violations
were
either
determined,
or
the
practices
which
form
the
basis
for
the
violations
were
determined
not
to
be
a
violation,
or
the
principles
were
amended,
that
the
reservoir
would
be
so--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
john
b.
draper
there
is
an
assumption
for
purposes
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
this
claim
that
the
procedures
have
been
violated.
mr.
john
b.
draper
they
are
terminated
for
the
moment,
but
that
is
only
by
letter
of
the
colorado
state
water
official,
and
that
letter
could
be
revoked.
mr.
john
b.
draper
these
are
the
only
operating
procedures
for
this
project,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
draper
no,
your
honor.
the
compact
itself
is
the
basis
of
that
authority.
mr.
john
b.
draper
the
statute
that
sets
up
the
project
requires
that
the
project
be
operated
in
compliance
with
the
arkansas
river
compact.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
draper
yes,
we
believe
so.
kansas
agreed
to
those
procedures
and
required
that
they
be
adopted,
and
gave
its
approval,
which
was
essential
for
the
funding
to
construct
the
project.
once
it
got
into...
was
built
and
began
to
operate,
the
state
of
colorado
immediately
stored
more
water
than
is
allowed
under
the--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
it
is
inherent
in
the
principles
themselves,
and
it
is--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--no.
we
base
our
position
on
the
compact
and
the
preamble
and
the
text
of
the
operating
principles
themselves,
and
the
precedent--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--the
first
remedy
would
be
an
injunction
to
discontinue
the
violation.
mr.
john
b.
draper
well,
we
have
shown
that
we
were
deprived
of
11,000
acre
feet
by
the
failure
to
abide
by
the
operating
principles.
mr.
john
b.
draper
the
assumption
of
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
does
not
exist.
there
is
no
showing
that
there
was
no
change
at
the
state
line.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
correct.
there
was
a
showing
that
water
that
otherwise
would
have
been
available
to
kansas
users
in
john
martin
reservoir
was
depleted
by
11,000
acre
feet.
mr.
john
b.
draper
well,
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
tradeoff
that's
inherent
in
the
principles.
there
are
depletions
during
certain
periods,
and
you
end
up
with
a
slight
accretion,
but
there
is
no
indication
that
kansas
is
getting
any
benefit
beyond
compliance
with
the
compact
by
enforcement
of
the
operating
principles.
mr.
john
b.
draper
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
draper
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
draper
we're
saying--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--well,
the
evidence
is
that
a
total
of--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--that
is
our
argument.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that
water
would
have
come
to
kansas.
mr.
john
b.
draper
yes.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
draper
the
water
we're
talking
about,
the
11,000
acre
feet,
would
be
routed
down
the
river
with
extra
water
added
to
cover
transit
losses
to
arrive
at
the
state
line
intact.
mr.
john
b.
draper
much
of
what
you
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
correct.
however,
the
kansas
deliveries
are
measured
at
the
state
line.
mr.
john
b.
draper
these
are
the
trinidad--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--yes.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that
is
essentially
correct,
your
honor,
and
those
flows
are
flows
into
john
martin
reservoir
which
typically
empties
every
season.
it's
not
a
large
pool
of
water
that's
sitting
there
year
after
year.
it
typically
empties
within
a
few
weeks
at
the
beginning
of
the
irrigation
season,
except
under
very
unusual
circumstances.
mr.
john
b.
draper
if
you
could--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--that
is
the
nub
of
our
argument.
mr.
john
b.
draper
yes.
mr.
john
b.
draper
we
take
issue
with
that,
your
honor.
that
is
for
a
different
period,
1925
to
1957.
this
project
did
not
exist
then.
our
claim
is
based
on
actual
operations,
1979
through
1984.
thank
you.
mr.
john
b.
draper
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
respond
to
the
united
states
initially.
with
respect
to
the
winter
water
storage
program
claim,
i
believe
that
there
is
some
confusion
here
as
to
the
appropriate
question
that
the
court
needs
to
address,
and
that
is,
while
there
may
be
dispute
about
the
quantification
of
the
depletions
of
usable
flow
caused
by
the
colorado
winter
water
storage
program,
we
would
assert
for
your
review
that
there
is
no
meaningful
dispute
with
regard
to
the
existence
of
depletions.
we
showed
40,000
acre
feet
of
depletions
of
usable
flow.
colorado
did
not
take
it
to
the
usable
ultimate
answer,
but
when
it
analyzed
the
27
years
of
our
general
study
period
in
which
the
program
didn't
operate,
it
still
found
depletions.
in
addition,
their
expert
took
our
model
and
made
modifications,
made
it
better
for
him.
he
still
said
it
wasn't
what
he
would
do,
but
he
could
not
make
those
depletions
go
away.
it's
a
very
robust
result
as
to
whether
there
are
depletions
or
not,
and
before
you
now
is
not
what
is
the
exact
quantification
of
those
usable
depletions,
but
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
article
iv-d
at
all.
mr.
john
b.
draper
because
there
are
both
retrospective
and
prospective
remedies
potentially
available,
and
the
prospective
remedy
is
very
important
to
the
state
of
kansas.
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof,
we
believe
that
by
relatively
clear
implication
the
court
in
nebraska
v.
wyoming
has
indicated
that
the
appropriate
burden
is
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
we
believe
that
if
you
tilt
the
playing
field
by
adopting
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
for
enforcing
compact
rights,
that
you
are
favoring
the
defendant
state,
which
in
most
cases
will
be
the
upstream
state.
with
respect
to
mr.
robbins'
comments
on
the
trinidad
operating
principles,
that
they
were
not
adopted
under
viii,
article
viii-b
of
the
compact,
we
would
assert
that
they
are
just
exactly
the
kind
of
procedures
that
are
laid
out
in
article
viii-b(2),
and
that
it
is
very
clear
that
the
compact
administration
was
acting
in
compliance
with
that
provision.
he
also
asserted
that
there
was
no
agreement
between
the
states.
on
the
contrary,
when
this
interstate
compact
entity
makes
a
decision,
it
is
an
agreement
between
the
states
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
compact.
we
believe
also
that
the
court's
ruling
in
texas
v.
new
mexico
in
1983
is
very
instructive
with
respect
to
the
utility
of
observing
and
honoring
and
giving
effect
to
operating
procedures
such
as
those
that
were
adopted
for
the
trinidad
project.
it
would
save
this
court
from
micromanaging
the
operation
of
trinidad
reservoir
as
to
when
those
gates
should
be
open
and
when
they
shouldn't,
it
would
solve
other
problems
that
are
before
the
court
on
these
exceptions
such
as
burden
of
proof,
the
question
of
laches.
it's
immediately
clear
when
someone
fails
to
follow
a
procedure.
there
is
a
baseline
conduct
that
is
agreed
to,
and
where
it
has
been
approved
by
it,
even
proposed
by
the
united
states,
the
owner
of
the
project,
we
believe
that
it
makes
good
sense
to
honor
that
set
of
procedures.
i
would
simply
point
out
with
respect
to
the
laches
argument
that
mr.
robbins
made
that
colorado
does
have
the
burden
of
proof
on
its
affirmative
defense
and
that
the
key
difference
which
the
special
master
recognized
in
his
report
is
the
type
of
knowledge
that
they
are
accusing
kansas
of
having,
and
the
knowledge
has
to
be
of
a
compact
violation
or
sufficient
to
lead
to
an
investigation
of
the
existence
of
a
compact
violation,
and
not
simply
the
existence
of
wells
upstream.
that
is
a
much
more
complicated
and
less
direct
piece
of
knowledge,
and
the
assertion
over
the
years
in
the
reports
that
mr.
robbins
has
referred
to
was
that
the
primary
if
not
only
effect
of
pumping
in
colorado
was
on
the
downstream
surface
diverters
who
had
less
water
to
divert
in
their
canals.
thank
you.
