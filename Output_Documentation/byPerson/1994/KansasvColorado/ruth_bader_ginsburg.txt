justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
master...
you're
not
contesting
that
he
said...
your
theory
ultimately
was
that
a
violation
of
the
separate
operating
principles
per
se
constituted
a
compact
violation,
and
that
was
a
theory
that
he
rejected.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
was
wrong
with
his
observation
that
there
were
other
remedies,
assuming
that
the
operating
principles
were
violated,
that
there
were
remedies
appropriate
to
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thank
you.
and
do
you
take
issue
with
the
special
master's
example
that
if
the
operating
principles
are
followed
meticulously
and
nonetheless
there
is
a
substantial
depletion,
there
is
nothing
that
kansas
can
complain
about?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
ultimately
this
question
of
burden
of
proof,
clear
and
convincing,
preponderance,
is
academic,
but
that
is
not
so,
as
i
understand
it,
of
your
position
on
laches.
you
are
supporting
colorado
on
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
say
the
same
would
apply
against
the
united
states?
here
you
are
saying
yes,
it
can
apply
against
a
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
you've
made
an
important
qualification,
at
least
as
to
remedy.
it
may
not
preclude
a
claim,
but
it
may
affect
the
character
of
the
remedy.
