well,
on
those
two
claims,
mr.
draper,
the
special
master
concluded,
as
i
understand
his
report
and
recommendation,
that
kansas
just
failed
to
demonstrate
adequately
those
depletions,
and
if
that
factual
finding
is
valid,
why
doesn't
that
end
the
matter
on
those
claims?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
presumably
the
parties
to
that
special
operating
program
can
sue
in
district
court
to
enforce
any
rights
under
that
separate
agreement,
isn't
that
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
now
this
is
what
the
master
said,
and
i
think
i
have
the
quote
right:
kansas
did
not
attempt
to
establish
that
the
flows
of
the
arkansas
river
at
the
state
line
were
less
than
they
would
have
been
if
the
trinidad
project
had
not
been
constructed
or
operated
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
article
iv-d
of
the
compact
allows
developments
such
as
trinidad,
subject
only
to
the
proviso
that
they
don't
materially
deplete
usable
flows
at
the
state
line.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
isn't
kansas'
suit
a
suit
for
violation
of
the
compact?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
sg
takes
the
position
that
the
compact
does
not
even
empower
the
compact
administrators
to
amend
the
compact
to
create
a
new,
enforceable
right
under
the
compact.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
how
does
viii-b
authorize
the
compact
administrators
to
establish
a
compact
violation
that
differs
from
that
set
out
in
article
iv-d?
i
mean,
that's
what
the
standard
is.
that's
what
your
suit
was
brought
under.
that's
what
the
master
said
kansas
didn't
prove.
i
just
don't
see
how
you
get
where
you
want
to
go.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
robbins,
does
colorado
concede
that
although
it
isn't
quantified,
there
has
been
some
material
depletion
of
usable
state
line
flows
as
a
result
of
groundwater
depletion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
you
could
say
yes
or
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
operating
principles,
were
they
because
of
the
approval
of
them
by
the
compact
administrators?
did
that
become
a
rule
and
regulation
of
the
compact
administration?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
kansas'
burden
of
proof
here?
is
it
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
or
by
a
preponderance--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
the
compact
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
we
have
suggested
that
a
preponderance
standard
is
appropriate
for
violations
of
a
decree,
is
it?
