justice
david
h.
souter
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
you
do
if
the
injunction
were
dissolved?
would
you
enforce
the
statute
by
restricting
the
benefits
at
the
oklahoma
level?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
get
your
approval
back,
there's
no
risk
of
there
being
an
evasion
of
review
on
the
analogy
with
the
mootness
flaw,
is
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
be
a
continuing
question,
but
right...
but
it
is
not
a
continuous
question
right
at
the
moment.
it
seemingly
is
not
a
practical
one,
and
if
it
does
become
a
real
one
again,
it
can
be
reviewed
then,
can
it
not?
there's
no
risk
of
evasion
of
review.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
reason
for
your
concession
to
justice
kennedy
on
the
3
years
that
when
you
take
the
3-year
hypothesis
there
would
be
no
basis
upon
which
you
could
reasonably
argue
that
the
individual
was
not
a
resident
and
i
presume,
indeed,
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
california,
so
that
it
would
follow
that
the
correct
comparison
was
between
that
particular
citizen
or
resident
and
all
other
california
residents,
and
once
that
comparison
is
made,
there
is
a
penalty?
isn't
that
the
reason
for
your
concession?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
might
not
be
a
penalty,
but
i...
didn't
you
concede
that
under
the
3-year
hypothesis
you
would
have
some
constitutional
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
would
it
be
more
of
a
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
distinction
does
not
turn
on
obviousness
of
residence,
or
some
such
thing
as
that,
why
is
it
more
of
a
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
what,
on
your
theory?
if,
in
fact,
the...
it
is
not
required
to
compare
california
residents
with
california
residents,
why
should
the
differential
be
any
more
problematic
after
3
years
than
after
1?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
don't
understand
why.
problematic
assumes
that
there
is
some
reason
for
its
being
problematic,
and
i
don't
know
what
your
reason
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
ask
you
the
question
directly
which
keeps
coming
up.
why
is
it
inappropriate,
on
your
theory,
to
compare
one
california
resident,
i.e.,
the
one
who
has
moved
in
from
oklahoma
with
intention
to
stay,
with
all
other
california
residents
for
the
purpose
of
determining,
on
whatever
level
of
scrutiny,
whether
there's
an
equal
protection
problem?
why
is
that
an
inappropriate
comparison?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
your
rational
basis
is
saving
money?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
take
it
at
no
point
in
the
litigation
has
the
state
raised
this...
a
challenge
to
the
bona
fides
of
the
residents?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
true
if
you
look
at
it
on
a
purely
individualized
basis,
but
there
is
a
rational
argument,
i
suppose,
to
the
effect
that
california
or
any
state
simply
cannot
afford
to
provide
a
generous
welfare
scheme
if
the
magnet
is
going
to
be
so
great
that
there
are
going
to
be
a
lot
of
short-term
"transients"
taking
advantage
of
it...
i
use
transient
in
quotes...
so
that
in
fact
the
only
hope
for
raising
the
level
for
everybody
is
to
do
it
under
circumstances
in
which
the
short-term
attraction
is
going
to
be
mitigated,
otherwise,
nobody
can
afford
it.
so
that
an
argument
is
being
made
that
a
good
system
cannot
exist
without
some
kind
of
limitation
like
this.
that's
a
rational
argument,
isn't
it?
if
we're
on
a
rational
basis
test
or
if
we
were
starting
at
square
one
and
construing
what
is
an
undue
burden
on
the
right
to
travel,
wouldn't
that
be
a
relevant
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not
questioning
you
about
precedent.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
simply
questioning
you
about,
if
we
were
starting
at
square
one,
that
would
qualify
as
a
rational
argument,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect,
i
probably
wasn't
clear
on
that,
but
that
wasn't
the
hypothesis
that
i
was
making.
the
state
simply
says,
as
a
necessity
for
maintaining
this
laudably
generous
system,
no
one,
whatever
their
motives
may
be,
will
get
this
higher
benefit
until,
let's
say,
a
year
has
passed,
or
something
of
that
sort.
there's
no
screening,
there's
no
inquiry
into
motive,
just
saying,
look,
the
system
won't
work
if
we
have
to
pay
this
to
everybody
who
comes
in
during
the
first
year.
