you'd
just
lose
a
lot
of
federal
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
invalidation
of
the
waiver,
you're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
garelis,
are
you
still
litigating
the
invalidation
of
the
earlier
waiver?
is
that
still
in
litigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
is
done.
that
is
completed
and
final.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
elimination
of
the
prior
waiver.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
currently,
it
is
finally
invalidated.
once
and
for
all,
it's
done,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
what
it
was
under.
is
it
final,
is
all
i'm
asking?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
haven't
appealed
it,
but
it's
not
final?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
don't
understand
why
the
state
has
enough
interest
to
bring
this
case
here
but
did
not
have
enough
interest
to
continue
to
litigate
that
issue,
to
just
roll
over
and
say,
the
waiver's
dead,
and
we'll
let
it
die.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that,
if
it's
not
a
penalty,
it's
not
a
penalty?
under
what
constitutional
standard?
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
penalty,
you're
saying,
but
not
enough
of
a...
you're
acknowledging
it's
a
little
bit
of
a
penalty,
because
otherwise
multiplying
it
by
three,
three
times
zero
is
zero.
you
must
be
acknowledging
it's
at
least
a
little
bit
of
a
penalty,
but
you're
saying
it's
not
enough
to
run
afoul
of
the
constitution,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
does
that
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
constitution
require
welfare
benefits?
have
we
said
that?
what
case
did
we
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
what
is
this
phrase
you're
coming
up
with,
they
are
receiving
a
constitutionally
permissible
amount?
where
does
that
come
from?
where
do
i
look
to
to
find
out
what
a
constitutionally
permissible
amount
of
welfare
benefits
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
zero
is
a
constitutionally
permissible
amount,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
why
drag
in
this
constitutionally
permissible
amount?
i
mean,
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
read
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
do
you
have
to
put
that
limitation
in,
and
becomes
a
bona
fide
resident?
i
mean,
if
there's
a
freedom
to
travel,
i
assume
it's
freedom
to
travel
whether
you
choose
to
become
a
bona
fide
resident
or
not,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
state
using...
i
understand
that
we
have
a
general
rule
about
freedom
of
travel,
and
a
state
cannot
penalize
people
for
moving
into
the
state,
but
it
seems
to
me
entirely
reasonable
for
a
state
to
object,
if
it
wants...
especially
a
state
that
wants
to
have
a
generous
welfare
program,
to
want
to
preserve
the
funds
that
it's
expending
in
that
program
by
not
becoming
an
attraction
to
people
who
move
to
that
state
for
no
reason
except
to
get
the
increased
welfare.
it
seems
to
me
so
reasonable
to
say,
we're
being
very
generous,
more
generous
than
most
states,
but
our
system
will
self-destruct
if
it
attracts
people
from
other
states.
why
shouldn't
we
make
that
kind
of
an
exception?
and
that's
what
they're
trying
to
do
here.
i
don't...
you
know,
saving
money
is
not
the
justification.
the
justification
is,
we
don't
want
to
attract
welfare
recipients
from
other
states
by
our
generous
benefits.
that's
what's
going
on
here,
but
why
isn't
that
reasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
knew
you
were
going
to
say
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
there's
a
difference
in
treating
somebody
differently
by...
i
mean,
let's
say
we're
not
going
to
give
you
library
privileges
in
the
state,
or
you
can't
use
the
state
tennis
courts,
or
you
can't
use
the
state
schools
for
a
certain
period.
all
of
those
have
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
individual,
like
most
residents,
is
supporting
the
system
whose
benefits
he
is
using.
whereas
in
the
case
of
a
welfare
recipient
who
moves
there
in
order
to
obtain
welfare,
you
know
from
the
start
that
this
is
a
person
who's
going
to
be
deriving
these
benefits
of
the
state
never
having
contributed
to
the
tax
base
of
the
state
from
which
those
benefits
are
derived.
surely
that's
a
different
situation,
and
it
seems
to
me
you
should
be
able
to
have
a
different
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
only
the
case
with
welfare.
nobody
else
you...
in
none
of
the
other
areas
can
you
say
for
sure
that
this
person
will
not
be
contributing
to
the
tax
base
from
the
time
that
the
person
arrives,
and
yet
will
be
deriving
this
particular
benefit.
