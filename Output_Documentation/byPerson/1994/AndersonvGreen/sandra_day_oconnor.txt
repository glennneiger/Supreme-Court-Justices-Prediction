why
isn't
the
right
to
travel
implicated
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
possible
that
the
cost
of
living
is
higher
in
california
than,
let's
say,
louisiana?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
california's
scheme
make
any
adjustment
for
the
higher
cost
of
living?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
in
a
very
real
sense
the
new
residents
are
worse
off
in
real
terms
than
they
would
have
been
due
to
the
cost
of
living
increase,
aren't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
as
though
they
are
just
as
well
off,
in
real
terms,
as
if
they
stayed
in
louisiana.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
for
purposes
of
knowing
whether
there's
a
violation
of
any
constitutional
protection
given
to
the
right
to
travel
and
establish
a
new
residence
in
a
new
state,
perhaps
it
does
permit
that
kind
of
an
inquiry.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there,
of
course,
california's
extending
the
same
level
of
benefits
both
to
long-term
residents
and
to
new
residents,
and
in
these
circumstances
california
has
a
two-level
benefit
scheme,
a
lower
level
for
new
residents
and
a
higher
level
for
residents
of
some
duration.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
the
difference.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
was
just
suggesting
in
real
terms
there
may
well
be
a
penalty.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
issue
is
ripe?
