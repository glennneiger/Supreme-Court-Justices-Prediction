justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
federal
law
relevant,
too?
i
mean,
you
couldn't
put...
could
you
put
this
law
into
effect
without
the
federal
approval,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
california
put
a
law,
this
law
into
effect
without
the
matching
federal
dollars?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
could,
theoretically?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
cases
had
come
up
in
a
different
order...
suppose
you
had
been...
the
beno
case
had
come
up
first,
so
you...
the
federal
permission
was
not
there,
and
then
these
plaintiffs,
the
green
plaintiffs,
had
begun
this
lawsuit,
wouldn't
you
be
taking
the
position
that
their
lawsuit
was
premature
because
you
in
effect
had
no
law
in
effect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
isn't
that
really
where
we
are
now,
that
this
suit
has
in
effect
not
become
moot,
but
become
not
ripe?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
say
that
you
don't
have
any
law
in
force
at
the
moment
other
than
the
old
law
under
which
the
newcomer
gets
the
full
benefits,
then
you're
asking
us
to
decide
a
hypothetical
case
about
a
law
that
is
not
yet
in
being.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
effect
you
have
no
law
of
the
kind
that
the
plaintiff
is
challenging.
the
law
in
force
in
california
now
is
the
law
that
you
pay
full
benefits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is
there
any
reasonable
basis
to
predict
that
you'll
get
it
back
when
the
federal
government
has
turned
down
such
applications
by
other
states
with
the
identical
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
don't
sit
to
give
advice
to
the
secretary
or
anyone
else.
we
sit
to
decide
cases
involving
law
that
is
in
force--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
now
the
law
that
you're
trying
to
defend
is
not
yet
law
in
being.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
wouldn't
the
secretary
have
had
to
have
chosen,
because
the
injunction...
it
was
the
secretary's
action
that
was
invalidated
in
that
beno
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
the
secretary
didn't
have
adequate
notice
and
comment,
and
so...
and
the
secretary
chose
not
to
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
the
secretary
says,
they
said
i
didn't
have
adequate
notice
and
comment,
maybe
i
didn't,
you
would
be
in
a
pretty...
you'd--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
your
theory
is
right,
how
long
could
california
maintain
this
differential?
it's
now
for...
in
the
statute
that
was,
and
that
perhaps
will
be
again,
it
was...
what,
1
year?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
they
do
it
for
2
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
your
reasoning,
could
california
also
adopt
a
law
that
would
say,
if
you
move
into
california
from
a
state
that
has
a
higher
income
tax...
that
might
be
hard
to
imagine,
but
maybe
there
is
one--
[laughter]
--that
has
higher
taxes,
then
you
pay...
you
pay
to
us
the
higher
taxes
till
you've
been
here
for
a
year?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
scheme
like
this
where...
i
know
some
differences
between
residents
and
nonresidents,
but
here
the
variation
is...
depends
on
the
state
you
come
from,
so
if
you
come
from
new
york
to
california,
you're
better
off
than
if
you
come
from
louisiana
to
california.
is
there
any
other
scheme
that
takes
the
newcomer
and
treats
that
newcomer
differently,
instead
of
just
making
a
distinction
between
old-timers
and
newcomers,
makes
a
distinction
between
newcomers
from
new
york,
treated
rather
well,
newcomers
from
mississippi
treated
not
so
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
it
wants
federal
money,
isn't
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
could
put
in
its
own
welfare
program
without
federal
dollars,
but
the
likelihood
of
that
is
not
great?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
voting...
the
time
that
one
must
live
in
california
to
register
to
vote?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--anything
other
than
the
genuineness
of
the
residency
that
would
be
a
legitimate
basis
for
distinction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
both
sosner
and
vlandis,
those
situations,
it's
that
you
distrust
the
claim
that
i
really
am
a
californian.
