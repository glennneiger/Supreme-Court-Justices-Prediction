--but
is
that
issue
still
under
litigation...
that
issue?
are
you
still
claiming,
in
that
proceeding,
that
the
secretary
did
have
adequate
notice
and
comment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
realize
it
was
made
on
a
pre...
this
is
a
preliminary
injunction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
many
decisions
are
made
on
preliminary
injunction.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
california
is
saying
still
in
that
proceeding,
by
the
way,
the
secretary
did
have
adequate
notice
and
comment,
and
we
insist
that
this
matter
still
be
litigated,
and
we're
going
to
appeal
it
again.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
rational
basis
is
saving
money,
they
say
you'd
save
twenty
two
and
a
half
million
dollars,
about
$1
per
recipient,
if
you
cut
it
across
the
board.
what's
the
rational
basis
that
instead
of
cutting
it
$1
across
the
board,
you
decide
to
take
a
separate
group
of
people
and
cut
it
by
$400?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
take
it
you're
willing
to
follow
the
consequence
of
that,
which
they
suggested
that
you
wouldn't,
that
then
you'd
go
back
to
square
one.
the
decree
would
be
vacated,
the
injunction
and
so
forth,
and
you'd
be
back
at
square
one,
having
to
bring
your
case
later
if
that
turned
out
to
be
necessary.
