ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
california
statute
is
antithetical
to
fundamental
structural
principles
of
our
federal
union.
there
are
no
degrees
of
state
citizenship.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
no,
we
do
not,
your
honor.
we
do
not
think
there
is
a
live
case
or
controversy
before
this
court.
the
case
is
moot,
or,
alternatively,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
whatever
case
might
come
to
be
has
not
come
to
be
and
the
case
is
not
yet
ripe.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
the
state
concedes
that
the
waiver
required
to
put
the
statute
into
effect
was
invalidated
in
beno.
it
did
not
appeal
to
this
court,
the
secretary
did
not
appeal
to
this
court,
and
the
state
then
resubmitted
an
augmented
waiver,
a
different
waiver.
we
do
not
have
that
statute
before
us.
but
if
you
should
reach
the
merits
nonetheless,
we
urge
you
to
affirm
the
district
court,
because
the
california
statute
does
very
much
violate
the
constitution.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
the
state's
concession
that
it
cannot
effectuate
the
statute
without
the
waiver
that
has
been
invalidated
that
puts
the
case
before
you.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
very
unlikely,
your
honor.
if
it
ever
did
with
this
provision,
that
would
be
a
different
case,
which,
as
you
pointed
out,
is
not
yet
ripe,
is
not
before
us.
should
you
reach
the
merits,
however,
the
california
statute
that
has
been
invalidated
plainly
violates
most
fundamental
structural
principles.
when
a
person
crosses
over
the
state
border
from
louisiana
or
oklahoma
or
mississippi
to
california
and
becomes
a
bona
fide
resident
there,
that
person
is
entitled
to
be
treated
equally
with
other
citizens
of
the
state
of
california--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--as
justice
o'connor
suggested
before.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--you're
free
to
travel,
but
you're
not...
nonresidents
are
not
required
to
be
treated
equally
in
all
respects
by
a
state
which
they
are
merely
visiting,
but
in
a
state
where
one
is
a
citizen,
and
the
fourteenth
amendment's
citizen
clause
makes
us
all
citizens
of
the
state
in
which
we
reside,
one
is
entitled
to
be
equally
treated
with
all
other
citizens
of
the
state
in
which
we
reside.
now,
justice
souter
raised
the
point
earlier
that
perhaps
sometimes
durational
residency
requirements
might
be
acceptable
in
order
to
test
the
real
bona
fides
of
residency
in
cases
where
there's
reason
to
suspect
that
perhaps
someone
is
coming
to
a
state
and
not
really
intending
to
reside
there.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
your
honor,
you've
summarily
affirmed
decisions
upholding
durational
residency
requirements
for
in-state
decision--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--correct,
your
honor,
but
they
are
entirely
different
from
this
case,
because
as
this
court
noted
in
zobel,
as
in
vlandis,
the
reason
for
making
a
student
wait
a
year
to
get
the
benefits
of
in-state
tuition
is
that
a
student
is
likely
to
be
characteristically
transient
in
a
way
that
no
welfare
recipient
is.
a
student,
unlike
a
welfare
recipient,
is
likely
to
come
to
a
state,
take
the
benefit
of
the
low-cost
public
education,
without
an
intention
to
remain
indefinitely.
bona
fide
residence
turns
on
an
intention
to
stay
in
the
state
to
which
one
has
migrated.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
yes,
it
could,
your
honor.
the
states
have
latitude
to
set
up
the
terms
for
bona
fide
residency,
but
as
the
court--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--a
year
is
generally
too
long,
unless
there
is
special
reason
to
fear
that
a
certain
population
is
going
to
come
into
the
state
on
a
transient
basis
to
procure
a
benefit
from
that
state
and
then
leave.
that,
after
all,
was
the
justification
in
sosner
for
upholding
the
durational
residency
requirement
for
someone
seeking
a
divorce.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
your
honor,
welfare
recipients
are
unlike
students
or
divorce-seekers
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
state
here
concedes
that
all
the
afdc
recipients
in
this
case
are
bona
fide
residents
of
california,
and
with
good
reason,
because
california
investigates
the
bona
fides
of
residents
in
order
to
determine
whether
these
persons
are
eligible
for
welfare
in
the
first
instance.
as
justice
scalia
suggested
for
the
court
in
smith
v.
employment
services,
this
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
already
in
place
a
procedure
in-state
for
individualized
determinations
of
eligibility.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that
is
correct,
justice
souter.
bona
fide
residence
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
there's
no
benefit
which
these
afdc
recipients
can
come
into
the
state
and
procure
and
then
leave
with,
such
as
the
degree
in
the
tuition
cases
or
the
decree
in
the
divorce
cases--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--because
the
money
is
spent
as
soon
as
it's
received.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
no,
your
honor.
what
we
suggest...
that
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
what
we
are
suggesting
here
is
that
bona
fide
residency
cannot
be
a
justification
in
this
case.
the
state
cannot
use
the
test
of
bona
fide
residency
as
a
justification
for
treating
new
state
citizens
differently,
which
is
a
presumptive
violation
of
the
constitution.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
scalia,
if
that
is
the
state's
justification,
the
statute
is
still
unconstitutional
and
unreasonable.
that
is
a--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--let
me
explain
why.
first,
that
is
an
impermissible
end.
the
mechanism
here
is
de
jure
facial
discrimination
against
new
state
citizens.
of
course
a
state
may
hoard
some
of
its
state-created
resources
as
against
nonresidents
of
the
state,
those
who...
the
very
definition
of
state
sovereignty
entails
that
a
state
may
reserve
its
resources
for
its
own
people,
but
when
someone
crosses
the
border
into
the
state
and
becomes
a
citizen
of
that
state,
the
state
may
not
say
to
that
person,
we
will
now
treat
you
as
a
second-class
citizen.
imagine
that
a
state
were
to
say,
well,
you've
moved
from
massachusetts
to
new
hampshire,
new
hampshire
doesn't
have
an
income
tax,
but
new
hampshire's
going
to
take
your
money
at
the
massachusetts
rate.
imagine
if
a
state
were
to
say,
well,
you've
just
moved
to
town,
your
kids
can
go
to
school,
you're
bona
fide
residents,
but
they'll
have
to
go
to
a
special
classroom
until
you've
lived
here
for
a
year
with
peeling
paint
and
fewer
textbooks.
if
you
called
911
in
the
new
state
within
the
first
year,
would
they
say,
well,
you
have
to
wait
an
hour
for
an
ambulance
because
that's
how
long
you
had
to
wait
in
mississippi?
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
in
nordlinger
v.
hahn,
your
honor?
but,
your
honor,
that
was
a
case,
justice
stevens
in
which
you
did
not
reach
the
question
whether
there
was
any
violation
of
the
right
to
travel,
because
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
simply
moved
intrastate
from
los
angeles
to
another
place
in
california.
we're
arguing
here
that
where
there
is
facial
de
jure
discrimination
against
new
state
residents...
that
is,
those
who
are
defined
as
a
class
by
virtue
of
having
recently
migrated
across
state
lines...
then
your
concern
for
the
structural
principles
of
the
constitution
is
triggered
as
it
need
not
have
been
in
nordlinger.
and,
indeed,
in
other
cases,
such
as
williams
v.
vermont,
you've
said
that
residents
and
non...
recent
residents
may
not
be
treated
differently
from
longer-time
residents,
even
with
respect
to
the
assessment
of
a
tax,
in
that
case
an
excise
tax.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
we
would
have
no
objection
to
that,
your
honor.
if
the
state
were
asserting,
as
it
does
not,
that
it
was
testing
bona
fide
residence
here
by
a
durational
residency
requirement,
then
the
principle--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--your
honor,
we
would
concede
that
that
is
constitutional.
a
state
may
not
define
who
is
a
citizen.
a
citizen
becomes
a
citizen
of
the
state
upon
residence,
but
it
may
define
residency
so
long
as
its
definition
is
reasonable.
a
year
is
far
too
long
to
be
reasonable
in
a
case--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--i'm
not
certain
of
that,
your
honor.
it's
certainly
less
than
a
year,
but
it
is
not
inconsistent--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--yes,
your
honor.
if
the
test
is
for
bona
fide
residency,
or
if
the
test...
if
the
state
is
trying
to
say,
we
are
worried
that
you're
not
really
here
to
stay,
and
so
before
we
share
our
benefits
with
you
we
want
to
make
sure,
that
would
be
acceptable,
if
there
was
reason
to
think
that
this
population
was
in
danger
of
moving
out
of
the
state.
that
is
not
the
case
with
welfare
recipients.
it
is
not
the
case,
as
with
divorce-seekers
in
sosner
who
might
have
misrepresented
their
attachment
to
the
state
and
then
dragged
it
into
collateral
attacks
on
its
judgments
in
other
states
thereafter.
there's
nothing
the
welfare
recipient
takes
with
them.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
your
honor,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
california's
relatively
higher
grant
levels
attract
poor
people
at
higher
rates
than
they
would
be
attracted
otherwise
by
the
prosperity
or
other
features
of
the
state,
but
even
if
that
were
so,
you
have
in
the
past
consistently
said
that
a
state
may
not
make
itself
attractive
to
insiders
but
discriminate
against
newcomers
in
order
to
keep
an
influx
of
newcomers
from
coming
into
the
state.
you
said
it
in
shapiro,
you
said
it
in
maricopa
county,
it's
implicit
in
zobel.
had
alaska
been
permitted
to
make
itself
less
attractive
to
newcomers,
it
could
have
discriminated
in
handing
out
its
oil
bounties
based
on
the
length
of
residency
in
the
state.
but
there's
good
reason
for
that,
as...
there
is
good
reason
for
saying,
we
will
not
inquire
into
the
motives
why
people
move
across
state
lines,
and
that
is
because
the
very
principle
of
the
federal
union,
one
of
political
unification,
the
very
principle
of
enjoying
the
benefits
of
federalism,
involved
the
freedom
for
people
to
cross
state
lines
in
order
to
go
where
their
tastes
are
best
satisfied.
if
they
are
attracted
by
better
public
services,
or
lower
tax
rates,
or
better
schools,
to
moving
to
another
state,
this
court
has
always
said
in
the
past
that
we
cannot
say
they
are
less
deserving
because
they
go
to
use
that
public
resource.
but
even
if...
even
if
you
were
to
depart
from
that
line
of
precedent
and
say
now,
for
the
first
time,
that
if
someone
crosses
state
lines
in
order
to
use
a
public
service
that's
better
in
the
new
state
than
they
deemed
it
in
the
old,
this
statute
would
not
be
narrowly
tailored,
or
even
remotely
tailored
to
that
goal.
this
statute,
if
it's
trying
to
fence
out
those
who
come
for
higher
welfare
benefits,
as
the
chief
justice
hypothesizes,
if
it
were
aimed
at
that
goal,
it
doesn't
fit
it.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
your
honor,
if
it's
a
rational
basis
test,
it
must
still
not
serve
a
forbidden
purpose,
or
it
still
must
be
logically
related
to
its
distinctions.
that
is,
you
have
said
in
heller
v.
doe
that
a
statute
need
not
be
empirically
proven
by
the
state
to
rest
on
a
rational
basis,
but
surely
it
remains
the
case
that
it
must
logically
relate
to
the
distinction
it
draws,
and
there
is
no
logical
relationship
between
the
first
12
months
of
residency
and
welfare-seeking.
this
statute
applies
even
if
one
comes
to
california
to
start
a
job,
comes,
starts
working,
works
for
8
months,
and
loses
one's
job,
and
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
needs
to
seek
afdc
benefits.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
souter,
you
have
long
said
that
the
purpose
you
have
just
described
is
a
forbidden
purpose,
or
an
impermissible
one.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
yes.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
souter,
if
you
were
starting
at
square
one
and
ignoring
the
admonition
in
shapiro
that
the
goal
to
fence
out
needy
people
is
an
impermissible
one,
the
statute
would
still
not
be
logically
tailored
to
that
goal.
and
the
reason
is
that
california
is
able,
through
its
existing
individualized
investigations
of
welfare
eligibility,
to
determine,
if
it
wished
to,
what
are
the
reasons
that
people
come
to
california.
and
if
it
wished
to
fence
out
those
who
have
come
not
to
escape
being
battered,
as
did
the
named
plaintiffs
here,
not
to
rejoin
family,
as
did
the
named
plaintiffs
here,
not
to
come
for
a
job,
which
one
unfortunately
lost
because
of
structural
economic
problems,
as
is
often
the
case
these
days
in
california,
if
someone
in
the
california
welfare
system
determined
that
one
had
not
come
for
any
of
those
reasons
to
become
a
californian,
but
had
simply
come
to
get
higher
benefits
because
they'd
read
that
they
were
higher
there,
then
california
could
screen
those
people
out
with
no
additional
expense
beyond
what
it
is
already
incurring
through
individualized
investigations,
but
the
very
fact
that--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
we
do
not
concede
that
would
be
constitutional,
because
we
think
if
states
can
begin
to
investigate
the
motives
people
move
in-state,
whether
it's
for
better
schools
or
lower
taxes
or
a
better
way
of
life--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
kennedy,
we
argue
that
it
is
impermissible
to
treat
new
state
citizens
unequally
merely
because
they
have
come
to
get
higher
welfare
benefits.
the
court
said
that's
a
perfectly
permissible
reason
for
crossing
state
lines
in--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--your
honor,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out
before,
that
argument
is
scarcely
credible
in
a
case
where
the
state
could
save
the
same
amount
of
money
by
reducing
benefits
76
cents
across
the
board.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
state
is
on
the
brink
of
financial
disaster
if
it
does
not
seek
some
alternative
means
of
achieving
the
same
savings.
if
it
were
the
case
that
the
states
were
unable
to
offer
generous
benefits
without
encouraging
an
influx
of
indigents,
congress
could
remedy
the
problem
by
setting
uniform
benefit
levels
or
some
such
thing,
but
that
financial
question
is
not
an
excuse
for
abrogating
the
fundamental
structural
postulate
that
new
state
citizens
must
be
treated
equally
with
citizens
who've
resided
in
the
state
for
a
longer
time.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
scalia--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
scalia,
with
respect,
the
statute
is
not
limited
to
those
who
will
be
on
welfare
from
the
time
they
arrive.
this
statute
forbids
grants
of
afdc
at
california
levels
to
anyone
who
has
moved
to
the
state
within
the
past
12
months,
even
if
she
comes
in
with
a
job,
but
even
if
it
were
the
case
that
it
were
limited
to
that
population,
it
remains
invidious.
you
have
said
in
many
other
contexts
that
even
a
small
difference,
when
it
has
an
impact
on
some
fundamental
distinction
between
persons,
is
enough
to
trigger
heightened
review.
it
would
not
be
enough
to
give
$1
less
to
blacks
than
whites,
it
would
not
be
enough
to
give
$1
less
to
democrats
than
republicans,
and
new
state
citizens
and
old
state
citizens
are
in
that
same
position.
so
with
respect
to
library
privileges
or
fishing
licenses,
you
haven't
reached
those
questions,
but
it
might
be
the
case
that
even
as
to
those
benefits,
distinctions
between
new
state
and
old
state
citizens
are
either
invidious
or
they're
irrational,
but
this
is
not
a
fishing
license
case.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
your
honor,
as
you've
suggested,
both
the
opinion
for
the
court
and
the
concurring
opinion
in
zobel
suggested
the
reason
for
that
in
the
tuition
cases,
as
in
the
divorce
cases,
is
a
fear
that
there
will
be
a
characteristically
transient
population
that
will
misrepresent
its
intent
to
stay
in
the
state
a
long
time.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
not
at
all,
your
honor.
it
is--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--hardly
ever
permissible.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
we're
not
saying
it's
never
permissible.
we're
saying
that
it
is
hardly
ever
permissible.
there's
hardly
ever
going
to
be
a
good
reason
for
distinguishing
new
state
residents
from
old
state
residents.
when
you're
worried
that
the
new
state
residents
are
really
nonresidents
in
disguise,
then
there
is
a
good
reason,
but
this
is
not
such
a
case.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
perhaps--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--that's
one
situation,
justice
ginsburg,
and
there
may
be
others.
for
example,
it
might
be
permissible
for
the
state
to
require
that
someone
live
in
the
state
for
a
set
period
of
time
before
he
or
she
runs
for
governor,
or
state
office.
we
have
a
residency
requirement
in
the
constitution
for
the
president
and
members
of
congress,
and
perhaps
a
state
could
impose
a
requirement
that
one
reside
in
the
state
for
a
certain
period
in
order
to
develop
the
attachment
and
loyalty
that
high
office
requires,
and
there
may
be
other
instances
which
we
don't
need
to
reach
today.
but
the
point
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
no
good
reason
for
the
distinction
california
has
drawn
here.
either,
as
justice
scalia
suggests,
the
real
reason
is
to
fence
needy
people
out
of
the
state,
or
to
keep
the
state
from
being
swamped
by
an
influx
of
indigents
seeking
welfare.
well,
if
that's
the
reason,
then
you
would
have
to
reverse
a
quarter
of
a
century
of
precedent
to
say
that
it
was
permitted.
that
is
a
forbidden
purpose
under
our
law.
but
if,
as
the
state
now
claims,
the
purpose
is,
rather,
to
save
money,
then
it
draws
an
impermiss...
it
uses
an
impermissible
means.
the
end
of
saving
money
is
of
course
permitted,
but
it
bears
no
logical
relation,
no
rational
relation,
no
conceivably
rational
relation,
to
the
distinction
between
new
and
old
state
residents.
new
state
residents
are
not
in
any
way
a
peculiar
source
of
evil
in
california.
there
are
no
differences
between
the
population
of
new
state
residents
and
old
state
residents
with
respect
to
their
needs,
with
respect
to
their
probability
of
working,
with
respect
to
the
likelihood
that
they'll
stay
on
the
rolls
or
get
off
them.
they
are
identical
in
every
other
respect
except
the
timing
of
their
migration
to
the
state.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
there
is
no
such
showing
in
this
record,
justice
kennedy.
the
state
has
adduced
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
people
do
or
do
not
move
for
higher
welfare
benefits,
and
that
thesis
very
much
in
doubt
in
all
the
leading
literature.
the
statute
either
seeks
a
forbidden
end,
or
employs
a
forbidden
means.
it
either
seeks
to
fence
new
residents
out
of
the
state,
and
it's
been
a
half-century
since
edwards
that
the
court
has
said
a
state
can't
do
that
even
if
the
new
folks
are
poor,
or
it
uses
a
forbidden
means.
it
distinguishes
between
new
and
old
state
residents
when
that
distinction
is
not
rationally
related
to
any
purpose,
fiscal
purpose
or
any
other.
i
would
point
out
also
the
state
has
argued
here
that
somehow
its
ability
to
experiment
with
welfare
reform,
its
hands
will
be
tied,
and
that
under
rationality
review
you
don't
tie
the
hands
of
the
state
in
solving
its
economic
problems.
well,
with
respect,
an
affirmance
in
this
case
will
in
no
way
tie
the
hands
of
the
state
to
engage
in
every
sort
of
experiment
in
welfare
reform,
be
it
time
limits,
or
work
incentives,
or
any
other
distinction
among
recipients
of
public
assistance,
except
for
a
distinction
that
distinguishes
new
state
residents
from
old
state
residents.
the
state
has
left
a
lot
of
latitude
here.
the
reason
why
new
state
residents
and
old
state
residents
can't
be
treated
unequally
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
fact
that
they
can't
protect
themselves
in
state
politics.
this
is
quite
different
from
a
case
under
ordinary
rationality
review,
where
a
state
might
be
permitted
to
distinguish
between
optometrists
and
ophthalmologists,
or
truckers
and
trains.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
new
state
residents
are
precisely
those
who
could
not
protect
themselves
in
the
political
process
because
they
weren't
there
at
the
time.
here
the
state
has
chosen--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but...
they
can
get
into
the
process
to
vote,
but
they're
still
likely
to
be
a
small
minority,
and
that's
not
the
true
point.
the
true
point
is
that
they
cannot
be
treated
differently
because
of
their
new
state
residency
because
of
the
structural
postulates
at
stake
in
this
case.
whether
you
look
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested
in
zobel,
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
to
the
citizenship
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
or
to
the
commerce
clause
itself,
it
is
clear
that
both
to
make
us
one
political
union
and
to
permit
citizens
to
take
advantage
of
the
laboratories
of
experiment
that
the
states
represent,
mobility
across
state
lines
must
be
allowed.
and
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
that
means
not
only
that
states
can't
erect
barriers
at
the
border,
it
also
means
that
new
state
citizens
cannot
be
treated
differently
once
they
cross
that
border.
they
must
be
treated
equally
unless
there's
a
good
reason,
and
there's
no
good
reason
here.
in
conclusion,
the
judgment
below
should
either
be
dismissed...
the
case
should
either
be
dismissed
because
the...
it
is
moot
for
the
reasons
explored
earlier,
or
in
the
alternative,
if
you
reach
the
merits,
you
should
affirm,
because
the
state
has
advanced
no
permissible
justification
that
is
rationally
related,
much
less
compelling...
much
less
necessarily
related
to
its
goals.
thank
you.
