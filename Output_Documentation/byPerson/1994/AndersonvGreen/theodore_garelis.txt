mr.
theodore
garelis
garelis,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
garelis
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
california
is
seeking
review
of
the
summary
affirmance
by
the
ninth
circuit
of
an
order
granting
a
preliminary
injunction.
that
order
was
made
by
the
district
court
in
this
matter.
california
asks
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
remand
this
case
with
instructions
that
the
preliminary
injunction
be
dissolved.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes,
it
would.
mr.
theodore
garelis
at
the
moment,
your
honor,
we
could
not
do
so.
as
noted
in
our
brief,
california
is
restricted
from
implementing
the
statute
until
a
federal
waiver,
which
was
invalidated
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
related
ninth
circuit
case,
is
restored.
mr.
theodore
garelis
because
state
law,
the
statute
here
in
question,
absolutely
requires,
by
its
own
terms,
that
california
have
that
waiver.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes,
your
honor,
the
secretary--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
theodore
garelis
well,
the...
no,
it
does
not,
that
is
true,
but
we
hav
always--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--no,
i
do
not
believe
it
has,
but
we've
always
taken
that
position.
mr.
theodore
garelis
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
yes,
we
could.
mr.
theodore
garelis
if
the
operative
actions
were
taken
by
the
secretary
of
health
&
human
services
to
restrict
our
funding
on
california's
medi-cal
program,
yes,
that's--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--yes,
it
could.
mr.
theodore
garelis
it
could
theoretically,
but
it
would
run
the
risk
of
losing
a
good
deal
of
federal
matching
funds.
mr.
theodore
garelis
no,
we
would
not...
we
have
always
interpreted
this
section
as
a
mandate
by
the
california
legislature
that
we
would
not
implement
this
particular
statute
without
the
waiver.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes,
we
have.
i
believe
it
was
on
august
25th
my
client
submitted
an
augmented
waiver
request
to
the
secretary
of
health
&
human
services.
mr.
theodore
garelis
i
believe
the
secretary
has
done
that
recently,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes,
we
would.
mr.
theodore
garelis
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
case...
the
questions
here
are
persistent.
the
case
in...
the
questions
of
constitutional
validity
of
our
statute
are
certainly--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--well,
the
law
was...
the
approval
of
the
waiver
was
obtained.
the
statute
did
come
into
effect.
the
statute
was
then...
the
district
court
by
means
of
the
preliminary
injunction
refused
to
allow
us
to
implement
the
statute,
then
the
next
year...
and
that
was
all
in
1993,
in
199...
in
late
'92,
excuse
me,
and
then
in
early
'94,
earlier
this
year,
while
we
were
still
in
the
process
of
appealing
the
preliminary
injunction
to
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
beno
case
did,
indeed,
take
away
the
waiver.
it
invalidated
the
federal
waiver,
and
what
that
did
was
under
state
law
made
it
so
that,
once
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
is
settled
in
the...
california's
favor,
then
we...
until
we
get
the
waiver
back,
we
could
not
enforce
the
statute.
mr.
theodore
garelis
well,
we
did
have
the
approval,
and
as
soon
as
we
get
the
waiver
back
we
would
be
able
to
implement
it,
but
it
is
true
at
the
moment
we
would--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--well,
perhaps
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
secretary
has
turned
down
such
waivers
is
because
of
lack
of
guidance
from
this
court
that
our
statute
should,
indeed,
survive
a
constitutional
challenge.
mr.
theodore
garelis
well--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--well,
the
ninth
circuit
invalidation
was
on
procedural
grounds.
it
was
on
a
preliminary
injunction.
it
was
all
very
preliminary,
so
it
certainly
has
not
been
adjudicated
on
the
merits.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
theodore
garelis
no,
but
this
is...
what
we're
arguing
is
that
this
is
a
continuing
question.
mr.
theodore
garelis
well,
no,
but
i
believe
it
would
be
wise
policy
to
have
this
question
settled.
many
states
are
currently
trying
to
enforce
such
statutes.
many
states
are
very
interested
in
implementing
such
statutes.
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
will
be
there.
it
is
in
front
of
this
court
at
this
time.
we
will
all
have
to
come
back
and
revisit
this
again.
the
court
has
granted
certiorari.
if
we
get
the
waiver
back,
and
the
court
does
not
address
it
at
this
time,
we
will
be
back
here.
i'm
sure
that
plaintiffs
will
challenge
the
statute
again
on
exactly
the
same
grounds.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes.
mr.
theodore
garelis
i
really
cannot
answer
that
question.
i
don't
know
why
the...
what
grounds
the
secretary
used--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--the
waiver
we
have
was
approved,
and
it
was
invalidated
by
the
ninth
circuit,
so--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--the
invalidation
of
the
previous
waiver
was
accomplished
by
the
ninth
circuit.
we
did
not
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
that
case.
the
order
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
that
the
matter
be
remanded
with
instructions
that
an
augmented
waiver
request
be
presented
to
the
secretary
of
health
&
human
services--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--well,
we
have--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--it
is
currently
invalidated
by
means
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
theodore
garelis
that
was
only
under
a
preliminary
injunc--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i
would
say
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
theodore
garelis
because--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--it
was
invalidated
by
a
preliminary
injunction,
and--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--we
can
still
address
the
merits.
mr.
theodore
garelis
it
was
invalidated
on
the
basis
that
the
secretary
of
health
&
human
services
had
not
adequately
considered
the
opposition
of...
of
those
who
were
opposed
to
the
statute
at
that
time,
that
the
administrative
record
did
not
reflect
an
adequate
review
of
the
opposition.
mr.
theodore
garelis
the
instructions
were
that...
i
can't
quote
them
exactly,
but
it
was
that
the
matter
was
to
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
that
it
be
remanded
to
the
secretary
for
additional
consideration.
that's
as
close
a
quote
as
i
can--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i
believe
california
thought
that
the
best
we
would
be
able
to
do
is
simply
to...
is
get
a
remand.
we
did
ask
the
ninth
circuit
to
rehear
the
matter
so
to...
as
to
order
a
remand
without
an
invalidation.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes,
it
was.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
theodore
garelis
but
we
also
would
have
had...
we
also
had
the
ability
to
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
i
believe,
because
we
were
a
party
to
that
action
also,
and
it
was
our
waiver.
mr.
theodore
garelis
it
was
hard
to
argue
it
when
the
secretary
was
not
going
to
join
with
us.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes,
i
believe
that's
still
under
litigation,
because
the
decision--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--was
only
made
on
a--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--yes.
mr.
theodore
garelis
well,
we're
going
to
have
to
wait
and
see
what
the
secretary's
resolution
is,
and
we
have
no
other
plans
of
litigating
except
for
that.
california
statute
is
a
benefit
reduction
statute,
and
therefore
california
submits
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
should
therefore
be
determined
as
with
any
other
benefit
reduction
statute,
that
is,
by
rational
basis,
because
our
statute
does
not
impact
either
a
suspect
class,
does
not
penalize
a
fundamental
right,
therefore
the
proper
analysis
is
the
rational
basis.
here
at
issue
the
benefit
reduction
statute
is
implemented
by
a
two-tier
system
of
payment
levels.
this
court
has
previously
approved
two-tier
systems
in
the
context
of
domestic
relations,
and
it
has
certainly
approved
them
in
the
context
of
out-of-state
tuition
differentials.
we
believe
that
this
rationale
is
on
point
here.
furthermore,
even
the
shapiro
case
acknowledges
that
not
all
waiting
periods
are
penalties.
others
have
tried
to
distinguish
these
cases
on
the
grounds
that
neither
domestic
relations
nor
public
higher
education
involves
the
necessities
of
life,
and
that
public
assistance
does.
however,
we
would
submit
that
this
misstates
the
issues.
a
benefit
reduction
is
not
necessarily
limiting
the
necessities
of
life.
if
so,
we
believe
dandridge,
your
result
in
dandridge
would
be
inexplicable.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
garelis
we
would
maintain
that
we
could
do
it
for
a
year.
we
have
not
addressed
the
issue
of
more
than
that,
but
certainly
a
year
is
a
temporary
amount,
and
we
would
submit
a
year.
we
would
submit
at
some
point,
i'm
sure,
above
a
year,
that
would
not
be
temporary
any
more,
but
we
have
not
taken
a
position
on
what
that
higher
amount
would
be.
mr.
theodore
garelis
we
believe
california
could
do
so
with
a
rational
basis,
and
we
believe
that
that
statute
would
be
adjudicated
under
the
rational
basis
standard.
mr.
theodore
garelis
the
right
to
travel
is
not
implicated
to
the
extent
necessary
to
become
a
penalty,
because
the
statute
is
very
carefully
drafted
to
maintain
the
recipient's
level
of
receipt
of
benefits.
mr.
theodore
garelis
that
may
be,
but--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--no,
it
does
not.
mr.
theodore
garelis
well--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--we
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
an
examination
of
real
terms
goes
against
the
afdc
program
as
it
is
set
up.
the
afdc
program
requires
that
each
state
set
up
a
standard
of
need,
and
then
the
state
sets
up
its
benefit
payments,
and
the
two
yardsticks
don't
have
to
meet
each
other
at
all.
in
fact,
california's
benefit
levels
are
under
the--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--well,
when
a
person
comes
from
a
state
with
a
higher
benefit
level
to
california,
that
person
is
restricted
to
the
california
benefit
level
even
in
the
absence
of
our
statute,
and
that
is
constitutional,
so
there's
no
reason
why
a
person
coming
from
a
state
with
a
lower--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--that
is
true,
but--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--yes,
but
when
you're
talking
about
analyzing
whether
or
not
there's
a
penalty,
you're
looking
at
a
strict
scrutiny
analysis.
since
there's
no
penalty,
we
would
submit,
you
evaluate
our
two-tier
system
under
the
same
rational
basis
standard
that
you
would
do
any
equal
protection
challenge
to
a
statute.
mr.
theodore
garelis
okay,
but
you
see
there's
nothing
to
guarantee
that
that
person
had
a
benefit
level
in
the
prior
state
that
met
the
necessities
of
life
in
that
state,
either.
the
necessities
of
life
really
don't
have
a
whole
lot
to
do
with
the
setting
of
the
benefit
levels,
and
this
court
acknowledged
this
in
dandridge.
mr.
theodore
garelis
well,
if
i
did
suggest
that
a
certain
amount...
i
did
so
in
error,
and
i
apologize.
any
amount
above
a
year
is
not
at
issue
in
our
statute.
we
believe
a
year
is
permissible,
based
upon
the
sosner
case,
which
allowed
a
year...
i
believe
a
year's
residency.
mr.
theodore
garelis
i
believe
amounts
over
a
year
would
raise
more
problems.
it
would
raise
progressively
more
problems.
mr.
theodore
garelis
pardon?
mr.
theodore
garelis
well,
it
would
be
a
penalty
at
that
point.
it
would
impact
more
on
a
right
to
travel
at
that
point.
mr.
theodore
garelis
i
think
we
would
have
to
admit
that,
yes.
mr.
theodore
garelis
no.
almost
anything
would
have
an
effect
on
the
right
to
travel.
the
question
is,
is
that
effect
of
a
magnitude
such
as
to
constitute
a
penalty?
california
submits
that
our
statute
does
not
constitute
that
magnitude.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes,
we
do.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes,
we
do.
mr.
theodore
garelis
what
we're
arguing
is,
is
our...
is
the
effect
of
our
statute
on
the
right
to
travel
of
a
magnitude
to
constitute
an
impermissible
penalty?
mr.
theodore
garelis
what...
the
way
i
would
interpret
it,
your
honor,
is
that
we
possibly
have
some
deterrence
effect
on
travel.
we
have
crafted
our
statute
very
carefully
to
avoid
that,
but
to
the
extent
we
have
some
deterrence
effect
on
travel,
it
is
not
of
a
magnitude
to
constitute
a
penalty,
and
we
would
look
at
the
tuition
cases,
we
would
look
at--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i
would...
i
believe
i
would
agree
with
the
thrust
of
your
question,
your
honor.
you
have
to
look
at
our
entire
statute.
what
we
are
offering
is
the
same
amount
of
benefit
levels
as
the
recipients
had
in
their
prior
state
of
residence.
we
are
offering,
through
related
programs,
increases
in
the
ability
of
a
recipient
to
earn
more
money
and
keep...
a
working
recipient
to
earn
more
money
and
keep
more
of
that
income.
we
are
also
allowing
a
person
to
work
more
hours
than
is
customarily
allowed
and
still
keep
their
benefit
levels.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes,
i
am.
mr.
theodore
garelis
no,
i
don't
believe
it
would,
because--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--because
the
amount,
your
honor,
that
was
received
by
that
recipient
in
the
prior
state
is
a
constitutionally
permissible
amount.
mr.
theodore
garelis
in
that
state,
and
that
should
carry
over
to
california--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--because,
as
i
stated
before,
any
concepts
of
standard
of
need
are
not
necessarily
related
to
the
setting
of
benefit
levels.
the
setting
of
benefit
levels--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--well,
let
me
try
to
restate
it
for
a
second,
because
i
don't
believe
i
stated
it
clearly
enough.
i
believe
one
has
to
look
at
the
entire
statute
as
a
whole,
and
the
statute
in
effect
has
many
provisions,
because
there
are
related
provisions...
the
program
has
many
provisions.
it
has
increases
in
some
benefits,
and
it
has
decreases--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--we
would
submit
that
because
california
is
offering
a
constitutionally
permissible
amount
to
all
recipients,
because
eligibility
is
not
in
question,
as
it
is
in
a
lot
of
other
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court,
for
those
reasons,
our
statute
is
constitutionally
permissible
and
does
not
constitute
a
penalty
on
the
right
to
travel.
mr.
theodore
garelis
i
would
answer
yes
with
one
proviso,
that
i
understand
that
your
question
includes
something
that
is
in
our
statute,
which
is
that
the
recipients
are
receiving
a
constitutionally
permissible
amount
in
their
state
of
prior
residence--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--yes.
mr.
theodore
garelis
no,
it
does
not,
but
certainly--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--because
those
are
the
amounts
that
are
being
paid
in
the
prior
state
of
residence
that
have
not
been
challenged.
mr.
theodore
garelis
in
effect,
your
honor,
you
are
correct,
because--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--because
what
is
being
challenged
here--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--is
whether
or
not
california's
amount
is
constitutionally
permissible--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--and
i
want
to
encourage
this
court
to
look
at
the
fact
that
the
amount
that
we
are
offering
people
is
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
theodore
garelis
no,
but
what
we
are
offering
people
is
an
amount
that
is...
is
offered
by
another
state
but
is
not
challengeable
and,
therefore,
california
ought
to
be
able
to
offer
a
like
amount
to
that
person
temporarily.
mr.
theodore
garelis
i
don't
believe
so,
unless
you
look
at
the
circumstance
of
someone
coming
from
a
state
with
a
higher
benefit
level
coming
to
california
and
getting
a
decrease
in
their
benefit
level,
which
is
not
challengeable.
mr.
theodore
garelis
no.
i
still
don't
believe
that
i've
made
a
concession
that
3
years
would
be
a
penalty.
i'm
saying
that
there
would
be
some
amount
at
some
point
which,
when
added
to
all
other
factors,
would
imply
a
penalty.
mr.
theodore
garelis
i
believe
what
i
said,
we
would
have...
under
a
factual
record
it
would
be
more
of
a
problem,
yes,
but
california
has--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--because--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--it
would
be
more
of
a
problem
because
that
person
would
be
getting
a
rate
that
was
not
the
california
full-level
rate--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--for
a
longer
period
of
time.
mr.
theodore
garelis
because,
as
with
any
factual
distinction,
it
might
be
more
problematic.
we
are
not
conceding--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--because
i
believe
in
order
to
establish
whether
there's
a
penalty,
one
ought
to
compare
what
one
received
in
one
state
compared
to
what
one
is
getting
in
the
other
state,
what
one
is
getting
in
the
old
state--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i
don't
believe
that's
an
inappropriate
comparison.
i
believe
that
at
that
point
you
use
a
rational
basis
standard,
and
examine
whether
california
has
a
rational
basis
for
the
two
different
tiers.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes,
the
rational
basis
is
saving
money.
mr.
theodore
garelis
because
california
did
many
things
at
that
time.
it
did
cut
benefit
levels,
it
did
raise
fees
at
universities,
et
cetera,
the
legislature
made
the
determination
of
resource
allocation,
and
that
is
the
legislature's
prerogative
to
do
so,
and
i
believe
this
court
in
dandridge
acknowledged
that
fact.
mr.
theodore
garelis
thank
you.
