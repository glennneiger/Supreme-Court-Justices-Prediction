justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
submission
to
us
is
that
you
would
not
implement
it
without
the
waiver?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
you
applied
for
the,
or
reapplied
for
the
waiver?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
some
indication
that
the
department
has
denied
waivers
submitted
from
other
states
that
contain
this
provision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
i
could
ask
one
more
question
about
the
administrative
process--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
there
an
indication
in
the
administrative
record
that
the
reason
the
agency
has
denied
the
waiver
is
because
of
its
interpretation
of
the
constitutional
minimum
standards
that
it
has
required,
or
is
it
also
plausible
to
surmise,
or
to
interpret
the
agency's
action
as
being
simply
the
agency's
determination
that
this
is
somehow
inequitable
as
a
matter
of
welfare
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
clear
from
the
record.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
me
the...
you
answered
justice
ginsburg
that
perhaps
2
years
would
be
an
impermissible
waiting
period,
if
i
interpret
your
answer
correctly.
what
is
the
legal
standard
that
you
apply
to
determine
that
the
2-years
or
3-year
waiting
period
might
be
inappropriate?
does
it
become
a
penalty
at
that
time?
was
that
your
reasoning,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
perhaps
i
was
reading
too
much
into
your
answer,
and
you
didn't
make
that
concession,
but
let
me
ask
you,
would
a
3-year
waiting
period
raise
problems
that
this
statute
doesn't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
what
constitutional
standard?
what
constitutional
rule
would
be
violated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
longer
the
disability,
the
more
it
impinges
on
the
right
to
travel?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
but
then
you
are
conceding
that
an
infringement
or
a
burden
on
the
right
of
travel
is
impermissible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
posit...
you
take
as
your
opening
premise
that
there
is
a
right
to
travel--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
there
cannot
be
a
penalty
imposed
upon
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we're
just
arguing
here
about
whether
or
not
that's
a
penalty?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
am
i
supposed
to
take
judicial
notice
that
students
are
more
apt
to
move
than
welfare
recipients?
i
mean,
how
do
i
know
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
concede
that
that
would
be
constitutional,
do
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
we're
slipping
away
from
the
argument
about
whether
or
not
this
isn't,
leaving
precedent
aside,
a
rational
policy
for
the
state
of
california,
who
wants
to
have
an
intact,
sound
welfare
program.
that's
where
we
began.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
you
ended
up
by
saying
you
could
screen,
and
i
just
don't...
i
don't
see
the
relation
between
the
two
arguments.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ms.
sullivan,
was
there
any
showing
in
this
record,
or
is
there
any
discussion
in
the
literature
with
a
statistical
survey
to
show
that
people
do
or
do
not
move
for
higher
welfare
benefits?
