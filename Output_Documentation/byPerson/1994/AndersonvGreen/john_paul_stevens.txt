but
is
the
length
of
the
period
the
measure
of
the
deterrence
on
travel?
supposing
that
the
payment
differential
is
the
difference
between
$400
and
$395,
and
you
say,
3
years
of
that
differential
would
be
unconstitutional,
but
1
year
of
the
difference
between
$400
and
$75
would
not
be
a
penalty.
is
that
your
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
suggesting
that
the
magnitude
of
the
differential
and
real
impact
on
the
person's
livelihood
is
what
we
should
look
at,
rather
than
just
the
length
of
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then,
if
it
were
true
that...
in
one
state
there
was
a
very
dramatic
difference
of...
i
can't
remember
the
figures,
but
there
was,
from
one
of
these
states
there
was
a
rather
dramatic
difference
in
the
amount
of
money.
would
that
perhaps
justify
a
different
result
as
to
people
coming
from
some
states
as
opposed
to
people
coming
from
other
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
matter
how
dramatic
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
that
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
your
test
before,
you
were
suggesting
that
at
a
certain
point
the
burden
becomes
a
penalty
and
interferes
with
the
right
to
travel,
and
i'm
a
little
puzzled
as
to
why
the
magnitude
of
the
differential
is
irrelevant
to
that
analysis,
but
the
period
of
time
is
critical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
statute
be
constitutional
if
it
did
not
have
those
offsetting
benefits
in
it?
supposing
all
you
had
was
this
one
naked
differential
in
the
amount
of
the
benefits
for
1
year,
and
it's
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
difference
a
month,
and
that's
the
only
difference
between
the
two
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
quite
sure
whether
you're
saying
yes
or
no
to
my
question.
if
there
were
no
difference
between
your
statute...
between
your
treatment
of
people,
recent
arrivals
and
old-time
residents,
other
than
a
rather
substantial
difference
in
the
dollar
payments
that
they
got
each
month
for
1
year,
no
matter
how
dramatic
the
difference,
would
that
be
permissible,
without
any
offsetting--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
can
say
you
pay
a
different
tax
rate.
they
can
say
you
pay
a
different
tax
on
your
home.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
point
that
in
the
chief
justice's
example
it
would
be
all
right
provided
they
gave
the
person
nothing,
not
just
a
lesser
benefit?
