chief
justice

h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-197,
eloise
anderson
v.
deshawn
green,
et
al.--
mr.
garelis.
is
that
the
correct
pronunciation
of
your
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
garelis.
mr.
garelis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that,
mr.
garelis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
realize
it
says
it
has
to
have
the
waiver.
i'm
looking
on
page
3
of
your
brief--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--which
sets
forth...
it
says,
this
section
shall
not
become
operative
until
the
date
of
approval
by
the
united
states
secretary
of
hhs.
i
take
it
at
one
time
the
secretary
did
approve--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
so
the
thing
became
operative
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
becoming
nonoperative
if
the
approval
is
revoked,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
it
been
construed
by
the
california
courts
on
that
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
was
the
basis
on
which
it
was
invalidated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
was
the
dis...
that
it
was
to
be
sent
back
to
the
secretary?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
again,
where
do
you
get
the
term,
consti...
the
reason
that...
the
constitutional
challenge
here
isn't
to
the
amount
in
the
abstract
but
to
the
fact
that
you
pay
california
residents
a
different
amount
than
you
pay
arrivals
who
have
been
there
less
than
a
year,
and
that
constitutional
challenge
is
based
on
the
right
to
travel,
but
certainly
you're
not
suggesting
that
someone
back
in
nevada,
or
wherever
they
may
have
come
from,
could
challenge
their
welfare
payment
on
the
grounds
that
it
wasn't
enough
to
live
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
garelis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
sullivan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
do
have
a
statute
before
us,
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
at
all
clear,
simply
reading
the
statute,
that
the
state
is...
state's
argument
is
correct.
it
seems
to
me
one
could
read
the
statute
to
say
that
once
the
waiver
has
been
given,
the
statute
comes
into
effect,
and
it
says
nothing
about
later
revocation
of
a
waiver,
but
the
fact
that
the
state
says
the
state
doesn't
plan
to
do
anything,
it
seems
to
me,
is
what
makes
the
case
moot
or
not
ripe,
rather
than
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
we've
upheld
durational
residency
requirements
for
state...
in-state
tuition,
not
just
for
testing,
but
simply
categorically.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
are
decisions
on
the
merits.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
a
state
set
up
any
sort
of
a
time
limit
and
say
that
you
don't
become
a
bona
fide...
you
cannot
become
a
bona
fide
resident
until
you've
at
least
been
here
30
days.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
year
is
too
long,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
your
view,
ms.
sullivan,
is
there
some
federal
rule
that
determines
how
we
find
out
whether
someone
is
a
bona
fide
resident?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
california
in
this
case,
ms.
sullivan,
said
nobody
shall
get
the
california
benefits
but
they'll
get
lower
for
60
days,
and
it's
not
to
allow
us
to
investigate,
but
we
simply
don't
recognize
anybody
as
a
resident
or
citizen
of
california
who
has
not
been
physically
present
here
for
60
days?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's...
no,
it's
not
testing
bona
fide
residence
at
all
under
my
hypothesis.
the
person
who
has
not
yet
been
there
60
days
could
take
the
stand
after
30
days
and
say,
i
left
my
former
domicile,
i
have
no
intent
to
ever
leave
california,
i
plan
to
leave
here
indefinitely.
so
as
far
as
conflicts
of
law,
that
type
of
thing,
one
would
meet
the
traditional
residency
test,
but
california
says
no,
that's
not
enough.
here,
it's
got
to
be
60
days.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
think,
if
california
pays
a
good
deal
more
in
welfare
benefits
that
other
states
do,
that
people
who
are
receiving
those
benefits
in
other
states
will
be
attracted
to
california?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
it's
a
rational
basis
test,
it
doesn't
really
need
tailoring,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
you're
putting
too
much
of
an
absolute
construction
on
some
of
our
other...
the
in-state
tuition
cases,
i
mean,
it
isn't
just
a
total
refusal
to
allow
the
states
to
make
any
distinction
between
old
and
new
residents.
they're
allowed
to
do
it
in
the
case
of
in-state
tuition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
there
have...
the
cases
have
gone
the
other
way.
your
tendency...
i
believe
you're
stating
that
this
is
just
never
permissible.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
presumably
they
can
get
into
the
political
process,
at
least
under
your
hypothesis,
in
very
short
order.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
sullivan.
the
case
is
submitted.
