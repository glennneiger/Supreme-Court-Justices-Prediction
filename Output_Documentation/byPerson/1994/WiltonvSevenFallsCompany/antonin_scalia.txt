justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
we're
back
where
we
started.
you're
saying
there's
an
unflagging
obligation
to
assert
jurisdiction,
although
once
it
asserts
jurisdiction
you
can
then
say,
however,
we
don't
think
this
is
an
appropriate
case
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
get
out
of
here,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
do
you
gain
by
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
gain
simply
the
statement
we...
instead
of
saying,
we
don't
think
this
is
an
appropriate
case,
get
out
of
here,
the
court
must
say,
we
think
this
is
an
appropriate
case
for
us
to
take
jurisdiction,
but
not
to
grant
relief,
get
out
of
here.
have
you
really
won
a
lot
for
your
clients
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
thought
that
answer
just
contradicts
what
were
you
telling
justice
souter.
i
thought
you
were
telling
justice
souter
that
you
were
not
going
to
make
them
go
through
that
extra
step
of
saying
we
have
jurisdiction
but
we're
not
going
to
give
you
a
judgment.
i
thought
you
said
that
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
that
the
district
judge
can
say
what
you've
just
said,
we
should
go
forward,
but
then
can
immediately
say,
having
gone
forward
we
find
that
all
things
considered
it's
better
for
the
state
court
to
proceed
than
it
is
for
us
to
proceed,
and
therefore
on
the
merits
we
decline
the
declaratory
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
the
merits
decision
is
also
a
moses
cone
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
now,
on
the
merits
of
whether
to
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
or
not,
what
is
the
standard
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but...
yes,
i
assume
not,
but
let's...
is
it
the
same
standard
as
moses
cone?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
lot
more
restrictive
of
the
federal
court
than
moses
cone,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
orlando,
you
answered
justice
o'connor
that
that
is
indeed
the
issue
here,
whether
we
should
use
as
a
jurisdictional
issue
what
we
have
said
to
be
the
basis
for
a
merits
determination
under
declaratory
judgment
actions,
but
is
that
really
the
issue?
do
we
know
that
the
dismissal
in
the
district
court
here
was
a
jurisdictional
dismissal?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
did
you
get
it,
it's
on
b
2,
b
1
of
the
cert
petition?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
i'm
a
fair
reader,
and
i
can't...
it
says,
b
2,
"the
district
court
in
its
discretion
may
provide
declaratory
relief.
"
it
didn't
say,
may
exercise
jurisdiction.
"to
determine
if
declaratory
relief
is
appropriate.
"
not
if
entertaining
jurisdiction
is
appropriate,
"the
court
may
consider
whether
the
declaratory
judgment
action
was
filed
in
anticipation
of
a
trial
on
the
same
issues.
"
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
and
then
it
goes
down
and
says,
"thus,
the
court
finds
that
exercising
jurisdiction
to
grant
declaratory
relief
would
result
in
the
piecemeal
adjudication.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
merits?
i
mean,
the
merits
is,
if
there
is
another
state
action
pending
and
declaratory
judgment
was
filed
in
anticipation
of
trial
on
that
same
issue,
why
isn't
that
exactly
the
merits?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
he
say
that?
was
it
put
that
way,
not
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe,
but
he
might
have
said,
as
the
court
here
said,
jurisdiction
to
grant
the...
this
is
very
subtle,
but
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
although
he
ended
up...
i'm
afraid
i
misled
counsel,
saying
he
dismissed.
he
didn't
dismiss.
he
stayed,
and
stayed,
i
guess,
is
really
much
more
consistent
with
declining
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
case
for
the
moment.
isn't
that
right?
or
maybe
it
isn't.
maybe
it
means
i
exercise
jurisdiction,
but
i'm
just
not
going
to
make
up
my
mind
about
the
declaratory
judgment.
maybe
it's
in
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
down
the
road
apiece.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
moses
cone
do,
do
you
remember?
did
they
dismiss
or
stay?
we
call
all
of
these
things
abstention
cases.
i
went
through
them
once
and
i
forgot
what
conclusions
i
came
up
with,
but
some
we
dismiss
and
some
we
simply
say,
we're
going
to
wait
to
see
what
the
state
court
does.
what
was
moses
cone?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
quite
different
things,
really,
aren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
did
the...
justice
stevens
and
i
were
just
speculating,
how
does
a
stay
get
to
be
appealable
as
a
final
order?
i
mean,
suppose
he
hadn't
announced
a
stay,
just
put
it
at
the
bottom
of
his
stack
of
cases,
just
didn't
get
to
it
for
several
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sounds
right
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
maybe
the
case
doesn't
belong
here.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statements
you
were
just
making
about
this
being
premature
as
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
assume...
and
about
race
to
the
courthouse
assumes
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
was
not
meant
precisely
to
permit
what
occurred
here,
to
permit
an
out
of
state
defendant
who
does
not
want
to
have
to
be
subjected
to
state
courts
to
file
first
in
order
to
avoid
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not...
i'm
saying...
i'm
just
saying
what
you
assumed.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
right
or
wrong,
but
why
do
you
assume
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
was
their
mistake,
then.
they
really
shouldn't
have
made
that
decision.
they
could
have
just
not
shown
up
and
say,
we
really
aren't
really
sure.
should
the
whole
thing
turn
on
that,
do
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
easy
enough
for
an
insurance
company
never
to
make
up
its
mind
categorically
until
the
action
is
filed.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
our
thinking.
it's
the
founding
fathers.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
blame
it
on
them.
it's
not
a
frivolous
suggestion.
they
did
establish
diversity
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
say
you've
nicely
avoided
that
by
including
another
party
in
the
state
action,
which
is
a
party,
a
texas
party,
so
that
removal
in
this
case
will
not
be
possible,
and
as
i
recall
they
say
that
occurred
after
they
filed
the
declaratory
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seemed
like
a
nice
argument
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
surely
true
when
the
state
action
is
filed
first,
but
here
it
was
filed
second.
suppose
an
insurance
company
wants
to
get
this
thing...
there's
some
reason
why
it
thinks
it's
necessary.
there
are
elderly
witnesses
involved.
they
don't
want
to
take
a
chance
about
witnesses
dying,
so
they
want
to
get
it
resolved
quickly,
and
they
don't
know
how
long
it
is
going
to
take
the
plaintiff
to
file,
so
they
file
a
declaratory
judgment
action
at
once,
and
then
what?
i
don't
know.
contract
statute
of
limitations
in
texas,
what
is
it?
it's
5
years
later
in
the...
after
a
lot
of
evidence
has
been
taken
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action
the
state
action
commences.
you
wouldn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
in
fairness,
though,
they
agreed
to
dismiss
it
because
they
thought
it
was
moot.
didn't
they
think
that
there
was
not
going
to
be
any
claim
made
against
them?
