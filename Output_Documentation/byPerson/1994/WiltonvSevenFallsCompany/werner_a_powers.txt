mr.
werner
a.
powers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
i
believe
opposing
counsel
has
conceded,
what
we
have
before
this
court
today
is
merely
a
question
of
statutory
construction,
no
more,
no
less.
the
question
before
this
court
is,
does
the
declaratory
judgment
act
mean
what
it
says
when
it
says
"may"
as
oppose
to
"must"
declare
rights,
and
are
we
going
to
engraft
on
this
statute
some
requirement
that
the
discretion
can
only
be
exercised
after
there
is
some
hearing
on
the
merits,
whatever
that
means?
the
issue
before
this
court
is
made
simpler,
it
seems,
because
it
comes
on
the
heels...
not
on
the
heels,
after
the
decision
in
brillhart
some
50
years
ago,
which
i
believe
has
already
answered
the
question
of
statutory
construction
for
this
court.
justice
frankfurter
clearly
held
that
the
discretion
was
vested
in
the
district
court
by
this
statute
to
have
the
discretion
not
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
a
declaratory
judgment
act,
particularly
when
there
is
a
state
court
proceeding
that
can
resolve
the
issue
and
all
the
issues
are
issues
of
state
law,
so
that
issue
has
been
decided.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
i
believe
he
does
use
the
term
"jurisdiction"
in
the
opinion.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
it
is
very
subtle,
and
picking
up
on
a
point
that
was
made
earlier,
it
may
be
that
we're
talking
semantics
more
than
anything
else.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
is
the
decision
not
to
exercise
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
relief
no
different
than
saying,
i'm
exercising
my
discretion
not
to
grant
relief?
mr.
werner
a.
powers
justice...
judge
hittner
in
his
opinion
was,
i
thought,
very
artful
in
the
way
he
drafted
his
opinion.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
indeed.
perhaps
it's
no
different
than
a
court
deciding
to
allocate
its
docket
in
such
a
way
that
it's
going
to
put
this
case
down
the
road
apiece.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
and
see
what
happens
in
the
state
court.
now,
that's
not
a
jurisdictional
decision.
that's
just
a
docket
allocation.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
treated
it
as
a
final
judgment
in
that
it
was
for
all
practical
purposes
concluded
with
the
stay.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
that
is
an
intriguing--
mr.
werner
a.
powers
--i
think
that
is
a
fair
point,
and
perhaps
does
argue
that
perhaps
abstention
analysis
is
at
play
here
to
some
degree.
i
don't
know
that
the
court
of
appeals
actually
focused
on
that
issue
when
they
took
jurisdiction.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
that
may
very
well
be
the
case.
but
to
say
that
they
did
not
focus
on
the
issue
is
not
to
say
that
had
they
focused
on
the
issue
they
may
have
decided
that
they
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
begin
with,
perhaps,
because
they
could
have
construed
this
as
a
nonjurisdictional--
mr.
werner
a.
powers
--that
is
true.
that
is
true.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
your
question.
i
think
that--
mr.
werner
a.
powers
--well,
they
are.
as
i
recall,
though,
the
policy
reasons
for
underlying
the
abstention
doctrines,
at
least
in
part,
was
that
it's
perhaps
less
prejudicial
to
the
litigant
who
is
petitioning
for
relief
to
stay
the
action
and
to
keep
it
on
the
court's
docket
in
order
to
see
how
the
state
court
action
or
the
parallel
proceeding,
whatever
that
might
be,
proceeds,
and
that's
somehow
less
draconic.
i
must
confess,
i
don't
know
that
that's
necessarily
true
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
i
don't
see
why
they
can't
simply
dismiss
the
case,
and
then
if
it
needs
to
be
refiled,
it
can
be
refiled
later
if
need
be,
but
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
that's
correct.
the...
whatever
procedure
is
used,
it
seems
to
me,
to
resolve
the
matter,
is
certainly...
should
not
be
dispositive
of
this
appeal.
the
problem
i'm
having
also
with
the
merits
of
this
issue
that's
being
advanced
by
the
petitioner
is,
we
have
had
the
decision
by
this
court
some
50
years
construing
the
statute.
there's
been
no
legislative
response
to
it.
now,
they've
had
plenty
of
time...
the
legislature
has
had
plenty
of
time
to
engraft
whatever
protections
need
to
be
engrafted
on
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
and
has
done
nothing,
which
i
think
leads
even
more
conclusively
to
a
conclusion
by
this
court
that
in
the
absence
of
some
legislative
response
to
the
earlier
decision,
that
we
should
interpret
the
statute
as
it
was
interpreted
by
justice
frankfurter.
now,
whether
that
means
it's
a
jurisdictional
issue,
or
it's
simply
a
decision
not
to
grant
the
relief,
how
that
is
handled
semantically,
it
probably
would
be
a
pure,
a
logically
pure
reasoning
to
say
it's
nonjurisdictional,
that
it's
simply
a
question
of
interpreting
the
statute
and
denying
the
relief
under...
with
the
discretion
of
the
court.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
i
think
so.
i
think
so,
but
i
also
think
you
could
probably
run
a
rule
56
motion
and
get
to
the
same
result.
that's
why
i
didn't
quite
understand
earlier
why
that
should
make
a
difference
whether
you
run
a
rule
56
motion,
a
summary
judgment
motion
saying
that
because
of
these
parallel
proceedings
you
should
not
exercise
jurisdiction
here,
or
you
should
not
grant
the
relief
because
there's
another
forum
better
suited
to
grant
complete
relief
with
all
the
parties.
either
way,
you
would
get
to
the
same
result,
it
seems
to
me,
whether
it
would
be
under
rule
12
or
under
rule
56,
and
surely
we're
not
here
in
this
court
because
it
was
a
rule
12
motion
as
opposed
to
a
rule
56
motion
that
was
filed
below,
but
either
of
those
two
provisions
would,
of
course,
accord
the
same
relief.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
i
think
so,
but
i'm
not
so
sure
you
have
a
statute
of
limitations
issue
with
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
this
case,
but
that
would
be...
that
is
typically
one
of
the
reasons
for
staying
instead
of
dismissing,
is
to
avoid
any
kind
of
statute
of
limitations
bar.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
if
memory
serves,
and
i
always
hate
to
pull
a
case
out
of
the
top
of
my
head,
but
doesn't
the
landis
case
speak
to
a
situation
where
a
trial
court
abuses
its
discretion
by
manipulating
its
docket
in
such
way
as
to,
in
essence,
never
reach
judgment
on
a
case?
mr.
werner
a.
powers
i
think
that's
the
case,
but
that's--
mr.
werner
a.
powers
--no.
we
did
not
ask
for
anything.
we
were
the
defendant.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
absolutely
not,
simply
a
declaratory
relief.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
no.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
we've
traveled
a
long
way.
it
must
belong
here.
[laughter]
mr.
werner
a.
powers
we
must
get
an
opinion
on
this.
the...
but
it
is
an
intriguing
jurisdictional
issue,
i
grant
that.
the...
i'm
also
having
difficulty
understanding
any
public
policy
reason
for
engrafting
the
colorado
river
notions
onto
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
the...
you
know,
making
erie
leaps
into
state
law
is
great
sport,
but
you
know,
the
fact
is
that
federal
courts
would...
who
already
have
an
overly
burdened
docket
ought
to
be
spending
what
little
precious
time
they
have
addressing
federal
issues,
federal
crimes,
and
not
guessing
at
what
a
state
court
will
do
in
resolving
purely
a
state
law
question.
the
declaratory
judgment
action
also,
as
in
this
case,
is
simply
used
for
abuse.
i
mean,
for
abuse
for
forum
shopping.
this
is
a
classic
example,
it
seems
to
me,
of
a
misuse
or
abuse
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
in
this
case,
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
insurance
law
for
just
a
moment,
typically
in
a
third
party
insurance
contract
you
have
two
distinct
duty.
you
have
a
duty
to
indemnify,
and
you
have
a
duty
to
defend.
in
this
case,
the
insurance
carriers
had
already
decided
not
to
afford
coverage
to
the
respondents.
they
had
already
rejected
any
coverage
with
respect
to
the
defense
obligation.
they
certainly
didn't
need
to
petition
a
federal
court
in
order
to
get
comfort
before
they
made
that
decision.
they
made
that
decision
without
any
judicial
intervention.
and
in
terms
of
indemnification
obligations,
the
winkler
county
action,
which
is
the
subject
of
the
declaratory
judgment
suit
below,
that
state
court
proceeding
is
still
on
appeal.
it
may
be
reversed.
who
knows
what
will
happen
with
that
state
court
proceeding,
so
it's
premature
to
grant
a
declaratory
judgment
action
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
will
be
indemnity.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
it's
in
west
texas,
your
honor.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
how
large
the
county
seat
is,
but
it's
a
relatively
rural
area.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
in
the
underlying
litigation...
this,
of
course,
does
not
involve
any
of
the
insurance
carriers.
it
was
brought
there
in
part
because
that...
it
was
an
oil
and
gas
dispute,
and
venue
was
proper
under
state
law
in
that
jurisdiction
because
of
where
the
oil
and
gas
was
being
developed.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
justice
scalia,
i
will
take
issue
with
that,
if
i
may.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
well,
the
purpose
of
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
before
a
party
breaches
a
contract,
before
they
engage
in
conduct
that
might
be
a
breach
of
contract,
and
thereby
expose
themselves
to
the
damages
that
flow
from
that,
that
they
would
go
to
court
to
seek
a
declaration
of
what
the
contract...
contractual
rights
and
duties
are.
that's
the
classic
example
of
why
you
would
use
a
dj,
and
that
often
happens
in
the
insurance
industry.
an
insurance
carrier
decides
to
defend,
even
though
they
think
there's
no
coverage,
and
then
they
simultaneously...
before
they
breach
a
contract
they
simultaneously
seek
a
declaration
of
their
rights
as
to
whether
they
have
a
duty
to
defend.
in
this
case,
the
carriers
had
already
decided
to
deny
defense.
they
had
already
breached
the
contract,
if
they
indeed
had
breached
it,
so
there
was
no
need
to
seek
a
declaration
with
respect
to
that
issue.
with
respect
to
duties
of
indemnification,
as
your
honor
knows,
you
cannot
use
the
declaratory
judgment
action
to
adjudicate
purely
speculative
results,
and
until
the
winkler
county
action
is
ultimately
resolved,
either
by
affirming
the
trial
court's
judgment,
or
modifying
it,
or
remanding
it
and
retrying
it,
whatever
happens,
it's
impossible
to
know
whether
there
will
ultimately
be
a
duty
to
indemnify
under
the
insurance
contracts,
so
why
are
we
wasting
time
with
a
declaratory
judgment
action
where
the
carrier
has
already
decided
to
breach
the
contract,
if
it
did
breach
the
contract,
and
it's
too
early
to
tell--
mr.
werner
a.
powers
--well--
mr.
werner
a.
powers
--i
think
we
would
have
had
a
truer
application
of
a
dj
action
if...
if
upon
giving
notice
to
the
carrier,
the
carrier
had
come
in
and
defended
the
lawsuit
and
simultaneously
sought
a
declaration
of
rights.
that
would
be
a
classic
example
and
a
proper
example.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
well,
at
the
risk,
of
course,
of
heresy
to
the
constitution,
i
will
say
there
is
something
that
many
state
courts
find
offensive,
at
the
concept
that
a
state
court
is
somehow
biased
simply
because
a
foreign
interest
is
before
the
bar,
and...
but
aside
from
that--
mr.
werner
a.
powers
--yes,
i
know,
but--
mr.
werner
a.
powers
--but
by
the
same
token,
by
the
same
token
congress
has
repeatedly
distinguished
between
federal
jurisdiction...
i
mean,
diversity
jurisdiction
and
federal
question
jurisdiction,
making
it
much
easier
for
litigants
to
petition
a
federal
court
for
relief
than
for
purely
diverse
parties
to
seek
federal
relief.
besides,
they
have
an
answer.
they
have
a
remedy.
if...
we
have
removal
statutes,
and
they
either
apply
or
they
don't
apply,
and
so
where
a
court--
mr.
werner
a.
powers
--well,
two
responses
to
that.
first
of
all,
it's
not
true,
and
of
course,
if
it
were
true,
they
had
a
remedy.
they
could
have
removed
the
case
and
argued
fraudulent
joinder
of
the
nondiverse
party,
and
there's
a
whole
body
of
law
that
could
have
come
to
their
rescue
if
rescue
they
needed.
but
they
didn't
remove
the
case.
they
didn't
test
the
fraudulent
joinder,
and
the
reason
they
didn't
do
it
is
because
it's
patently
frivolous,
because
obviously
the
hunts,
who
are
the
other
plaintiffs
and
the
other
carriers,
they
didn't
talk
the
other
carriers
into
rejecting
coverage
solely
so
the
hills
could
defeat
removal
jurisdiction,
so
while
that's
a
nice
argument
that--
mr.
werner
a.
powers
--well,
it's
a
nice
argument.
they
have
a
remedy
for
that,
and
so
the
issue
that
you're
addressing,
and
that
is,
are
we
doing
disservice
to
the
constitution
by
creating
an
impediment
to
a
foreign
interest
seeking
relief
from
a
federal
court,
the
answer
is
no.
the
answer
is,
they
have
removal
statutes.
if
the
removal
statutes
apply,
they
will
apply,
and
if
the
foreign
interest
has
truly
a
right
to
be
in
federal
court,
that
right
will
be
afforded.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
and
the
answer
to
that,
again,
is
in
the
framers
of
the
constitution
and
in
the
congress.
i
mean,
the
district
courts
are
creatures
of
legislation,
and
the
legislation
makes
clear
that
you
have
to
have
complete
diversity,
so
i
guess
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
no,
they
can't
remove
the
case
because
there
isn't
complete
diversity,
but
then
it
was
never
envisioned
that
litigants
could
petition
the
federal
court
where
there
wasn't
complete
diversity.
that's
just
the
way
the
statutes
are
written.
i
have...
in
responding
to
your
questions,
i
believe...
i
suppose
there's
one
thing
i
should
pick
up
if
i
can,
justice
ginsburg,
because
i
want
to
stress
that
we
should
not
divorce
rules
of
law
from
practicality,
and
there
is
nothing
more
egregious
than
two
courts
racing
to
judgment
with
the
same
controversy.
there
is
nothing
that
creates
more
waste.
there
is
nothing
that
creates
more
animosity
between
two
systems
of
justice,
a
state
system
and
a
federal
system
of
justice.
i've
been
there.
i've
seen
it,
and
you
see
it
frequently
where,
whenever
one
litigant
in
the
race
to
judgment
is
displeased
with
a
ruling
by
that
judge,
he
runs
to
the
other
forum
and
tries
to
pit
one
court
against
another
court.
it's
not
only
a
waste
of
resources,
it's
entirely
unseemly,
it
seems
to
me,
and
absent
extraordinary
circumstances
there
is
no
reason
for
a
federal
court
to
be
acting
in
a
purely
declaratory
manner
when
you
have
a
pending
state
court
action
that
can
fully
resolve
the
issues.
as
was
noted
by
one
of
the
justices
earlier,
somebody
has
to
give.
somebody
has
to
give,
and
congress
in
the
dj
statute
gives
the
federal
courts
the
ability
to
give,
and
that's
what
the
federal
courts
should
do,
is
they
should
give,
and
they
should
yield
to
the
state
court
remedy.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
i
think
under
the
law
he
would
probably
have
the
discretion
to
do
that.
i
would
argue
that
to
exercise
that
discretion
would
be
abusive
under
those
circumstances.
i
have
a
hard
time
imagining
any
situation
in
which,
given
the
pendency
of
a
state
court
action,
given
that
you're
only
dealing
with
state
law
questions,
okay,
given
that
you
have
complete
identity
of
parties
in
the
two
proceedings,
i
find
it...
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
compelling
reason
why
a
federal
court
should
make
an
erie
leap
that
it
doesn't
need
to
make
solely
for
the
purpose
of
intruding
itself
into
that
state
court
action.
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
a
reason
for
that.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
i
think
that
is
why
the
discretion
feature
is
given
to
the
district
court.
you
could
perhaps
hypothesize
a
situation
where
the
state
court
action
is
not
filed
until,
say,
several
years
after
the
federal
court
action
has
been
filed,
and
it
has
proceeded
apace
to
such
a
point
that
it
would
be
a
total
waste
of
judicial
resources
not
to
reach
a
resolution.
mr.
werner
a.
powers
indeed,
and
in
this
case,
of
course,
very
little
water
had
been
tread
before
the
state
order
was
entered.
moreover,
one
fact
i
think
is
interesting
in
this
case,
bearing
on
this
issue,
is
that,
remember
there
were
two
declaratory
judgment
actions.
the
petitioners
come
into
this
court
saying,
all
we
want
is
to
rush
to
judgment,
rush
and
hurry
and
get
a
declaratory
action
filed
and
get
resolution
of
this
issue.
they
dismissed
their
first
case.
they
dismissed
it,
and
quite
frankly
would
never
have
refiled
it
but
for
the
fact
that
the
policyholder
declared
its
intentions
to
seek
affirmative
relief
in
state
court,
so
this
is...
just
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
is
not
one
where,
as
you
might
posit,
a
carrier
legitimately
is
at
a
loss
for
a
declaration
of
its
rights.
this
is
not
that
case.
they
did
not
seek
an
immediate
resolution
of
the
issue.
in
fact,
they
agreed
to
dismiss
their
case,
and
there
are
no--
mr.
werner
a.
powers
--i
don't
believe
that
there's
anything
in
the
record
to
suggest
that,
and
i
might
say,
there's
been
a
lot
of
things
outside
the
record
in
the
briefing,
and
i
haven't
pointed
that
out
in
opening,
but
much
of
the
arguments
that
they
make
that
the
hills
have
engaged
in
forum
shopping
themselves
is
really
outside
the
record,
and...
but
anyway,
that
did
not
exist
there.
unless
there
are
any
other
questions
by
the
court,
i
appreciate
the
court's
attention
and
i
yield
the
rest
of
my
time.
