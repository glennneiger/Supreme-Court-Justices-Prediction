chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94
562,
leslie
wilton
v.
seven
falls
company.
mr.
orlando.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
follow
up
on
justice
kennedy's
question,
does
your
answer
suggest
that
the
court
should
treat
a
dismissal
as
exactly
the
same
way
as
staying?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
even--
--on
these
facts,
supposing
the
district
judge
had
said,
i
have
jurisdiction
here,
and
i
have
an
unflagging
obligation
to
exercise
it,
but
on
these
facts,
there's
a
lawsuit
pending
in
the
state
court
and
i'm
not
going
to
grant
a
declaratory
judgment.
is
that
a
permissible
disposition
of
the
case
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
saying
the
district
court
has
to
go
through
the
whole
moses
cone
list,
even
though
it's
a
declaratory
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
the
fact
that
it's
a
declaratory
judgment
affect
the
moses
cone
calculus?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
was,
how
does
the
presence
of
a
declaratory
judgment
request
affect
the
moses
cone
analysis?
are
you
in
the
process
of
answering
it,
or
have
you
gotten
onto
something
else?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
spite
of
the
discretion
granted
by
the
statute
itself?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
orlando.
mr.
powers,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let's
go
ahead
on
the
assumption
it
does,
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
winkler
county?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in...
how
large
is
the
county
seat?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
reason
why
all
this
litigation
was
brought
there
rather
than
somewhere
else?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
