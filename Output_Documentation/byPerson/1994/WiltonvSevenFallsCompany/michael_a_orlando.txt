mr.
michael
a.
orlando
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
heart
of
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
the
use
of
the
word
"may"
in
the
context
of
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act,
which
provides
that
the
federal
courts
may
declare
the
rights
and
other
legal
relations
of
any
interested
party
seeking
such
declaration.
we
contend
that
the
word
"may",
as
used
in
that
context,
means
three
things
and
only
three
things.
the
first
is
the
literal
connotation
of
the
word,
such
that
the
federal
courts
may
grant
the
relief
requested
and
make
a
declaration,
the
second
meaning
is
that
the
court
may
grant
the
declaration
provided
there
is
a
justiciable
controversy,
and
the
third
meaning,
the
final
meaning,
is
that
the
court
may
grant
the
relief
provided
the
case
does
not
fall
within
the
category
of
cases
presenting
exceptional
circumstances
as
described
by
this
court's
colorado
river
doctrine.
the
present
analytical
framework
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
fails
in
the
third
respect,
and
that
is,
it
gives
no
balancing
of
the
guidelines
that
were
established
in
colorado
river
and
moses
cone
against
the
virtually
unflagging
obligation
of
the
district
court
to
accept
jurisdiction
of
the
case,
and
that
is
precisely
the
fatal
flaw
in
the
fifth
circuit's
approach.
the
majority
of
the
circuits
around
the
country
have
adopted
the
colorado
river
moses
cone
analytical
framework,
and
that
seems
to
be
working
well
with
the
district
courts.
they
are
able
to
use
the
factors
that
have
been
established
as
the
six
factors
to
be
considered
in
such
cases,
they
balanced
those
factors,
weighed
it
against
the
concept
that
jurisdiction
is
virtually
unflagging,
and
they
either
decide--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--yes,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you,
and
i
agree
that
that's
what
mr.
borchard's
understanding
of
the
remedy
was
as
well,
is
that
a
new
federal
remedy
was
being
created.
it
was
something
that
at
that
point
in
time
the
federal
courts
would
not
have
had
the
ability
to
decide
a
case
that
just
sought
a
declaration,
because
there
was
no
federal
remedy
along
those
lines,
but
the
heart
of
the
issue
is
that
there
must
be
a
distinction
between
the
exercise,
the
threshold
question
of
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
versus
the
granting
of
the
equitable
remedy
being
sought,
and
the
petitioners
herein
do
not
contend
that
granting
of
a
declaration
is
mandatory.
the
wording
of
the
statute
is
contrary
to
that.
what
we
do
contend
is
that
there
is
discretion
to
grant
the
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you
that
that
is
a
sensible
way.
the
only
disagreement
that
the
petitioners
have
with
the
way
things
are
happening
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
that
what
is
essentially
unfettered
discretion
is
given
to
the
district
judge
to
abstain
on
that
threshold--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--question.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
well,
your
honor,
beginning
with
the
brillhart
case,
which
essentially
is
the
respondents'
touchstone
in
this
matter,
which
seemed
to
give
very
wide
discretion
to
the
district
court
on
the
very
threshold
issue,
the
very
next
term,
in
the
winter
haven
case,
this
court
said
that
you
can
decide
these...
you
can
abstain
or
use
discretion,
but
it's
only
in,
i
believe
the
words
were,
the
extraordinary
case,
or
the
exceptional
circumstances,
and
so
in
the
very--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--yes,
your
honor,
the
winter
haven
case
was
a
declaratory
judgment
case.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
i
believe
injunctive
relief
was
sought
in
that
case
as
well.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
the
court
has
said
that,
and
that's...
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
that
is
not
our
position
in
this
case.
our
position
is
that
what
we
merely
seek
is
that
this
court
declare
to
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
colorado
river
moses
cone
analytical
framework
should
apply.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
not
from
the
literal
sense
of
the
word
"abstention",
which
i
take
to
mean
dismissal,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
again,
your
honor,
i
do
contend
that
it
is
a
threshold
question.
we're
not
standing
before
this
court
contending
that
the
colorado
river
moses
cone
analysis
is
not
a
threshold
issue.
i
believe
it
is.
it
is
something
that
the
court,
the
district
court
in
the
very
first
instance,
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
a
respondent
should
go
through
the
analysis
of
looking
at
a
given
set
of
standards
and
say,
either
this
case
should
be
dismissed
or
stayed
based
on
the
guidelines
as
set
by
this
court,
and--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--yes,
your
honor.
in
this
instance,
where
we're
referring
to
parallel
state
court
proceedings
as
being
the
basis
for
such
an
abstention
or
stay,
as
the
court
in
moses
cone
noted,
the
effect
of
a
stay
when
you're
dealing
with
parallel
state
court
litigation
is,
practical
consequences,
the
same
thing
as
a
dismissal
because
of
the
res
judicata
effect.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
the
court...
unfortunately,
your
honor,
what's
happening
is
the
lower
courts,
the
circuit
court
opinions
as
well
as
the
district
court
opinions,
do
terribly
confuse
just
the
very
pure
abstention
doctrine
versus
the
prudential
deference,
as
some
of
the
cases
refer
to
it
as,
in
the
colorado
river
moses
cone
analysis.
and
i
would
ask
the
court
that
it
adopt
this,
what
i
would
term
prudential
deference,
in
the
same
situation
of
a
declaratory
judgment
remedy
with
a
diversity
based
case,
and
that's
what
this
court
is
presented
with
here
today,
is
the
basis
for
federal
court
jurisdiction
is
purely
diversity,
do
not
have
a
federal
question
involved
in
this
case,
and
under
that--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--no,
your
honor.
that
is
not
what
i'm
asking.
what
i
am
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
say
that
there
is
a
virtually
unflagging
obligation
to
exercise
jurisdiction
unless
there
are
exceptional
circumstances
in
which
the
court
can
either
abstain
or
defer
to
the
state
court.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
that...
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree,
because
that
is
what
the
colorado
river--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--well,
that
is--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--your
honor,
the
practical
effect
of
telling
the
lower
courts,
though,
that
they
may
simply
elect
not
to
take
a
declaratory
judgment
case
for
any
reason
at
all
as
long
as
it's
not
bias
or
prejudice,
means
that
we
have
effectively
done
away
with
a
declaratory
judgment--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--i'm
sorry
i
was
confusing,
your
honor.
what
i
meant
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
was,
i
don't
believe
that
it's
necessary
to
go
through
a
trial
process.
i
thought
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
so,
because
as
this
court
did,
as
judge
hittner
did,
we
had
to
have
a
hearing,
an
oral
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
and
all
that
the
petitioners
are
requesting
herein
is
that
at
such
time
as
the
district
court
takes
up
the
motion
to
dismiss,
that
he
consider
that
he
has
a
virtually
unflagging
obligation
to
accept
the
jurisdiction,
but
that
in
exceptional
circumstances
he
may
either
abstain
completely
or
defer
to
the
state
court.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
well,
i
do
agree
from
the
standpoint
that
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
make
an
initial
ruling
on
the
merits
when
considering
whether
or
not
to
defer
or
abstain.
all
that
must
be
done
is
an
analysis
of
the
very
threshold
jurisdictional
question
under
a
certain
set
of
guidelines,
and
i
believe
borchard
in
some
of
his
writings
also
presaged
some
of
the
guidelines
that
the
court
should
use,
and
although
i
don't
know
that
he
predicted
the
six
that
came
out
of
the
colorado
river
moses
cone
analysis
very
well--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--well,
the
main
reason
that
you
do
force
some
sort
of
guidelines
onto
the
district
court
is
because
if
you
do
not
do
that,
your
honor,
then
essentially
you
have
unfettered
discretion,
and
that's
our
big
squabble
today,
is
that
we
contend
that
the
district
courts
should
not
have
unfettered
discretion.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
yes,
your
honor,
i
would--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--your
honor,
the...
our
contention
is
that
the
colorado
river
moses
cone
analytical
framework
should
be
used
in
precisely
that
fashion.
that's
all
that
we
ask.
if
the
district
court
in
reviewing
that
line
of
cases
makes,
in
his
discretion,
the...
an
order
stating
that
his
court
should
either
abstain
completely
or
defer
to
the
state
court,
then
we
wouldn't
be
here
today,
and
that's
precisely
what's
happening
throughout
the
majority
of
the
district
courts
around
the
country
today,
but
just
not
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
no,
that's
not
what--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--i
believe
that,
your
honor,
the
moses
cone
decision
was
purely
a
jurisdictional--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--that...
those
facts
aren't
presented
by
this
case--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--your
honor,
so--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--i
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
because
the
declaratory
judgment
statute,
the
grant
of
a
declaration
is
essentially
an
equitable
remedy,
that
the
court's
other
equitable
decisions
would
apply
in
that
setting
as
well.
just
as
the
court
must
look
at
whether
or
not
the
granting
of
an
injunction
was
proper
in
a
given
case,
then
the
court
will
exercise
the
same
standard
on
the
merits
as
it
would
in
any
other
equitable--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--not
on
that
alone,
your
honor,
only
because
that
would
have
been
just
one
of
the
factors
that
the
court
has
said
in
the
colorado
river
and
moses
cone
analysis
that
should
be
looked
at.
the
court--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
precisely
the
position
that
this
case--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--it
affects
it
in
the
sense
that
this
court's
decision
just
about,
i
guess
6
years
ago
in
the
nopsi,
a
shorthand
rendition
of
the
new
orleans
public
service
case,
that
was
a
declaratory
judgment
case
as
well,
and
the
court,
although
it
didn't
go
through
the
colorado
river
moses
cone
abstention
analysis
because
it
presented
a
different
type
of
abstention,
the
court
was
having
to
look
at
the
burford
and
younger
abstention
doctrines,
that
was
a
declaratory
judgment
case,
and
it
just
so
happened
it
presented
federal--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--well,
your
honor,
i
guess
it
doesn't
change...
our
position
would
be
that
it
does
not
change
the
colorado
river
moses
cone
analysis
at
all,
that
the
same
factors--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--yes,
your
honor,
because
the
discretion
that's
granted
by
the
statute
itself
is
the
discretion
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
statute
itself,
from
just
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute,
does
not
mention
the
word
"jurisdiction".
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
does
the
word
"jurisdiction"
appear.
that
statute
is
merely
the
creation
of
a
federal
remedy,
and
that
got
back
to
my
opening
statement,
your
honor,
that
i
believe
that
the
only
proper
way
to
interpret
that
language
of
"may"
declare
the
rights
is
that
threefold
test,
that
you
literally
can
declare
the
rights,
you
have
to
go
through
the
justiciability
analysis,
you
can't
grant
the
declaration
if
it's
not
a
justiciable
controversy,
and
also,
you
don't
have
to
grant
the
relief
if
you
go
through
the
colorado
river
moses
cone
analysis--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
calvert--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
the
will
v.
calvert
case,
your
honor,
which
was
decided
just
a
couple
of
years
after...
it
was
in
between
colorado
river
and
moses
cone,
there
were
four
justices
that
were
led
by
the
chief
justice
in
the
plurality
opinion
which
sent
the
case
back
down,
as
i
recall,
but
the
fifth
justice,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
voted
with
the
other
four
justices
to
state
very
specifically
that
the
colorado
river
analysis
should
apply.
so
we
did
have
five
justices...
even
though
there
were
three
separate
opinions
in
that
case,
five
of
the
justices
post
colorado
river
said
no,
we
need
to
apply
the
colorado
river
analysis.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
that
is
the
precise
question
before
this
court--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--it
doesn't
present
the
better
point
of
view
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
the
first
and
perhaps
the
most
important
is
just
the
pure
separation
of
powers
between
congress
and
the
legislative
branch.
the
congress
set
forth
the--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--yes,
your
honor,
the
congress
did
give
discretion,
but
again,
i
would
reemphasize
that
our
position
is
that
that
discretion
was
to
grant
the
relief,
not
to
accept
jurisdiction.
congress,
it
is
very
clear,
and
there
are
some
cases...
i
can't
recall
the
name
of
any
that
this
court
has
said,
but
i'm
almost
certain
there
is
supreme
court
precedent
for
the
authority
that
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
is
a
remedial
statute,
that
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
jurisdiction,
and
while
it
is
a
discretionary
remedy,
there
are
lots
of
federal
discretionary
remedies,
injunction
relief,
though
really
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
reason
to
treat
the
discretionary
relief,
the
equitable
type
of
relief
being
stated
from
a
declaratory
judgment
versus
any
other
type
of
equitable
relief
that
this
court--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--part
of
the
problem
with
that
approach,
your
honor,
is
that
if
this
court
does
not
give
some
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
as
to
which
factors
should
or
should
not
be
looked
at
by
the
district
court,
then
in
essence
the
court
is
granting
unfettered
discretion,
and
what
is
or
may
happen
is
the
district
court
may
simply
look
at
his
docket
and
say,
my
docket
is
overcrowded
with
criminal
cases--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--if
that's
the
only
factor,
then
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
although
it
is
a
fairly
compelling
factor
in
and
of
itself,
if
the
court
didn't
look
at
some
of
the
other
reasons
why
the
case
might
properly
be
in
federal
court,
then
it
would
be
our
contention
that
again,
that
would
be
basically
unfettered
discretion.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
the
dismissal,
although
the
order
is
not
worded
specifically
saying
that
i'm
declining
to
accept
jurisdiction,
a
fair
reading
of
the
order,
as
well
as
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
is
that
it
was
a
threshold
question.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
but
it
is...
i
agree
that
is
the
wording,
but
there
was
no
consideration
of
the
merits
of
the
proceeding,
and
that's
really
the
basis
for
my
position,
your
honor,
is
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
hearing
he
didn't
talk
about
merits.
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
well,
the
merits
of
this
case
would
have
had
to
address
the
propriety
of
whether
or
not
the
insurer
should
be
defending
the
underlying
litigation,
which
was
the
principal...
one
of
the
principal
issues--
mr.
michael
a.
orlando
--well,
those...
your
honor,
there
are
perhaps
three
or
four
of
the
other
colorado
river
moses
cone
factors
that
the
court
should
have
considered
and
the
court
should
have
balanced
