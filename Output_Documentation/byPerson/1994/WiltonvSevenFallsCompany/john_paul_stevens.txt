justice
john
paul
stevens
you
know,
one
of
the
ironies
of
the
issue
is,
we
talk
about
colorado
river
as
unflagging
obligation,
and
of
course
they
didn't
retain
jurisdiction
in
that
case
itself,
and
one
of
the
factors
that
justice
brennan
mentioned
in
the...
in
his
opinion
under
all
these
unflagging
factors
is
desirability
of
avoiding
piecemeal
litigation,
citing
brillhart.
and
he
also
says
that
the
factors
don't
have
any
necessary...
you
don't
know
which
one
is
the
heaviest
and
how
to
weigh
them,
but
i
don't
know
why,
even
within
the
colorado
river
formulation,
one
couldn't
say
that
a
district
judge
has
some
discretion
to
decide
whether,
given
the
case
going
forward
in
two
different
court
systems,
which
one
is
a
better
forum
for
adjudicating
the
merits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
he
looks
at
the
docket
and
says,
if
i
take...
keep
this
case,
i'll
be
able
to
try
it
in
about
30
months,
it
will
probably
go
to
trial
next
week
in
the
state
court,
and
that's
the
only
factor
i
look
at.
is
that
a
sufficient
factor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
it's
just
a
stay,
not
a
dismissal.
was
this
an
interlocutory
appeal,
or
was
that...
is
a
stay
a
final
judgment?
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
have
jurisdiction
to
review
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
case
was
still
pending
in
the
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
any
time
the
district
court
decided
to,
he
could
have
just
said
i
think
i'll...
i
find
out
that
the
proceedings
have
been
delayed
interminably
over
in
the
states,
and
i
think
we
ought
to
go
ahead
with
this
trial.
nothing
would
have
prevented
the
judge
from
doing
that,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
that's
why
they
didn't
want
to
publish
their
opinion.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
they
affirmed.
they
didn't
dismiss
the
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why--
--is
this...
i'm
sorry.
go
on.
of
course,
isn't
there
another
factor
we
at
least
ought
to
think
about
for
a
minute,
that
one
of
the
whole
purposes
of
diversity
jurisdiction
is
to
avoid
the
danger
of
a
forum
that's
somewhat
prejudiced
in
favor
of
the
local
citizenry,
and
if
the
law
would
say,
well,
we
will
let
the
local
court
go
forward,
we
kind
of
forget
why
the
authors
of
the
constitution
even
granted
diversity
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
not
say
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
a
federal
district
judge
to
say,
well,
that's
a
pretty
complex
proceeding
over
there
in
the
state
court.
it's
going
to
take
a
long
time
to
decide.
they've
got
all
those
parties
in,
and
these
parties
just
want
me
to
decide
one
narrow
issue.
i
will
exercise
my
discretion
to
go
ahead
and
decide
that.
you
wouldn't
say
he'd
be
off
base
doing
something
like
that,
would
you?
