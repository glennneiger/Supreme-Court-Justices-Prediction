justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
--well--
--but
did
the
district
court,
or
the
circuit
court
in
this
case,
ever
purport
to
be
abstaining?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
your
argument
so
far
you
have
talked
about
the
discretion
not
to
grant
declaratory
relief
as
if
it
were
abstention,
and
it
seems
to
me
those
are
very
different
things.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
many
of
the
factors
you
look
to
with
the
abstention
determination
parallel
the
factors
that
you
look
to
with
reference
to
declaratory
relief,
but
i
suggest
that
perhaps
the
one
factor
that
is
not
present
in
declaratory
relief
is
a
virtual
unflagging
obligation,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
conflating
in
all
of
your
discussions
so
far
abstention
and
failure
to
grant
declaratory
relief
in
the
sound
discretion
of
the
court,
and
that
those
are
analytically
two
quite
separate
foundational
principles
for
the
court
to
consider.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suggest
to
you
again
that
the
court
did
not
say,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
interpret
its
opinion
as
saying,
that
it
was
abstaining.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
want
us
to
say
there
is
an
unflagging
obligation
to
grant
declaratory
relief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
counsel,
suppose
that
the
state
of
new
york,
i
don't
know
if
this
is
true
or
not,
has
a
statute
which
is
exactly
parallel
to
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
suit,
and
this
action
were
brought
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
enjoin
the
parties...
to
declare
the
rights
of
the
parties.
would
you
tell
the
state
court
of
new
york,
in
determining
whether
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
grant
a
declaratory
judgment,
that
it
has
to
consider
moses
cone
factors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
is
no
different
than
that.
now,
many
of
the
factors
that
the
court
considers
sound
very
much
like
moses
cone
factors,
and
they
are,
but
you
don't
cite
moses
cone
for
the
proposition
that
the
declaratory
judgment
relief
is
either
properly
or
improperly
denied
in
the
matter
of
the
court's
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
colorado
river,
as
i
read
the
opinion
we
affirmed
the
order
dismissing
the
complaint.
we
usually
should
talk
about
dismissing
actions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
ask
for
an
injunction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
1292,
or
did
the...
pardon
me.
did
the
plaintiff
ask
for
an
injunction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
1292(a)
doesn't
work.
