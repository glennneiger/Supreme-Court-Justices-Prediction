mr.
orlando,
now
moses
cone,
that
was
not
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
was
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
thought
after
colorado
river,
wasn't
there
that
case
of
will
v....
what
was
it?
justice
sandra

calvert--
--calvert,
and
didn't
the
plurality
there
refer
back
to
brillhart
and
say
brillhart
set
the
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
why
shouldn't
we
adhere
to
that?
that
was
a
post
colorado
river
case.
moses
cone
wasn't
a
declaratory
judgment
case.
why
shouldn't
we
stick
with
brillhart?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
it's
time
to
declare
that
brillhart
sets
the
standard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
exactly,
and
i
would
like
to
know
why
that
doesn't
present
the
better
point
of
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
congress
gave
the
judicial
branch
some
discretion
in
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
that's
clear
on
the
face
of
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
first
case
is
number
94-562,
wilton
versus
seven
falls
company
and
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
petitioners
are
various
insurance
underwriters.
the
respondents
are
owners
of
oil
and
gas
properties
in
texas.
the
respondent's
ask
the
petitioner's
to
defend
or
indemnify
them
under
several
commercial
liability
insurance
policies.
when
they
became
involved
in
litigation
against
third
parties
and
the
insurance
underwriters
decline
to
do
that
and
after
a
sizable
verdict
was
entered
against
respondents,
the
respondents
told
the
petitioners,
they
intended
to
file
suit
under
the
insurance
policies.
the
petitioners
immediately
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
in
federal
district
court
to
the
effect
that
their
policies
did
not
cover
respondent's
liability.
the
respondents
then
sued
petitioners
in
state
court,
and
asked
the
federal
district
court
to
dismiss
or
in
the
alternative
to
stay
the
declaratory
judgment
action
given
the
pendency
of
the
parallel
state
court
action.
the
federal
district
court
did
enter
a
stay
on
a
ground
that
the
state
suit
encompassed
the
same
coverage
issues,
raised
in
the
federal
action.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
two
different
circuit
court
splits
on
issues
in
the
case.
first,
courts
of
appeals
have
divided
on
the
circumstance
under
which
federal
district
courts,
may
stay
or
dismiss
declaratory
judgment
actions
in
light
of
the
pendency
of
the
similar
state
court
proceedings.
some
courts
applied
this
court's
1942
decision
in
brillhart
which
upheld
a
district
court's
broad
discretion
to
enter
a
stay
under
circumstances
similar
to
this
case.
other
courts
have
looked
to
language
in
this
court's
cases
in
colorado
river
and
moses
cone
and
upheld
that
a
district
court
must
point
to
exceptional
circumstances
before
it
may
stay
or
dismiss
federal
declaratory
judgment
actions.
we
hold
a
more
permissive
standard
set
forth
in
brillhart
rather
than
the
exceptional
circumstances
test
governed
here.
the
declaratory
judgment
act
in
our
view
justifies
standard
vesting
district
courts
with
broad
latitude
in
determining
whether
and
when
to
grant
a
declaratory
judgment.
our
cases
have
repeatedly
characterized
the
act
as
an
enabling
act
which
confers
a
discretion
on
the
courts
rather
than
an
absolute
right
upon
the
litigant,
and
because
of
this
broad
discretion
we
think
the
declaratory
in
a
declaratory
judgment
context,
the
normal
principle
that
federal
courts
should
adjudicate
claims
within
your
jurisdiction,
yields
to
considerations
of
practicality
and
wise
administration.
now,
the
second
issue
on
which
court
of
appeals
have
divided
is
the
proper
standard
of
appellate
review
of
district
court's
decisions
to
stay
declaratory
judgment
proceedings.
some
courts
adopted
de
novo
review
standard,
others
review
for
abuse
of
discretion.
we
believe
that's
more
consistent
with
the
statute
to
vest
district
courts
with
the
discretion
in
the
first
instance
because
facts
bearing
on
the
fitness
of
the
case
for
resolution
are
peculiarly
within
their
knowledge
and
grasp.
accordingly,
we
hold
a
proper
measure
of
review
is
the
abusive
discretion
standard.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
justice
breyer
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
