justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
we
just
go
back
to
that.
we're
dealing
with
a
request
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
it
was
my
understanding,
as
i
think
it
was
borchard's,
who
wrote
the
act,
that
a
declaratory
judgment,
that
that
is
a
matter
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
that
there
is
jurisdiction,
but
it
need
not
be
exercised.
that's
the
way
the
author
of
the
act
described
it.
that's
what
the
notion
of
a
declaratory
remedy
is.
well,
if
it's
too
iffy,
the
court
says
we
won't
handle
it,
for
any
of
a
variety
of
reasons.
isn't
that
what
a
declaratory
action
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
a
declaratory
judgment
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
no
other
relief
sought?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
this
court
ever
said
what
you're
contending,
that
you
must
exercise
the
jurisdiction
but
when
you
go
through
the
whole
trial
you
stop
because
you
have
discretion
with
respect
to
the
remedy?
that
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
what
extent
is
what
you're
saying
inconsistent
with
the
statement,
there
is
nothing
automatic
or
obligatory
about
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction
by
federal
court
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action
even
if
the
parties
are
proper
and
the
jurisdictional
amount
is
present.
the
distinction
between
jurisdiction
over
the
case
and
the
propriety
of
exercising
that
jurisdiction
must
be
borne
in
mind.
those
are
borchard's
words
about
the
statute
that
he
largely
composed.
i
take
it
you
don't
agree
with
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
must
you
go
through
a
checklist,
instead
of
saying,
here's
a
case
where
the
insurer
is
suing
first,
and
then
you
have
another
case
where
the
insured
is
coming
into
court,
there's
no
federal
question,
there
are
more
parties
in
the
state
court
action,
and
the
one
thing
that
you
shouldn't
have
is
wasting
judicial
resources
by
having
two
courts
deal
with
the
same
matter
at
the
same
time,
so
one
court
should
defer
to
the
other,
right?
it's
just
simply
a
question
of
which
one
should
wait.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
that
a
fundamental
point
is,
you
should
not
have
two
lawsuits
over
the
same
matter
going
on
at
the
same
time,
unless
there's
extraordinary
reason
for
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right,
and
then
the
decision
has
to
be
made
which
of
the
two
lawsuits,
and
what
are
the...
we
have
two
lawsuits
going
on
now.
what
are
the
standards
that
you
say
should
control
whether
the
federal
court
suit
stops
and
lets
the
state
go
forward,
or
whether
the
state
should
stop
and
let
the
federal
suit
go
forward?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
all
that
could
be
done
in
the
state
court,
and
i
think
you
agreed
with
me
that
one...
the
fundamental
thing
that
we
start
with
in
these
days
of
overcrowded
courts,
even
without
that,
you
should
not
have
two
courts
proceeding
in
the
same
matter
at
the
same
time.
that's
so
basic.
and
then
the
question
is,
which
one,
and
it
seems
that
this
court,
this
district
court
just
explained
why,
that
everything
could
be...
everything
that
was
brought
to
the
federal
court
and
more
was
pending
before
the
state
court,
plus
that
suit
came
up
in
the
ordinary
course,
the
insured
suing
the
insurer,
not
the
insurer
anticipating
the
suit.
so
what
reasons,
other
than
the
ones
that
were
given,
need
to
be
given?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
factors,
other
than
1)
there
should
be
one
lawsuit;
2)
the
state
court
is
not
going
to
relinquish
this
case.
it's
got
all
the
parties,
or
more
of
the
parties
before
it
than
in
the
federal
court.
what
else,
beyond
that,
should
a
sensible
district
judge
consider?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
just
the
difference
between
12b(1),
which
would
be
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
12b(6)
doesn't
state
a
claim
for
relief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
the
stay
result
in
the
district
court
is
like
if
you
grant
a
motion,
a
forum
non
conveniens
motion
when
the
forum
is
broad
and
the
district
court
wants
to
make
sure
that
that
other
litigation
really
goes
forward
before
dropping
the
case.
if
it's
reinstituted
there
may
be
a
statute
of
limitations
question.
maybe
that
was
the
logic
behind
the
stay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
can
they
remove,
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
state
court
suit
doesn't
have
complete...
there
isn't
complete
diversity,
and
there's
no
basis
that
you
could...
one
defendant
could
get
out
and
get
into
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that's
very
far
afield
from
your
case
where
the
federal
action
was
reinstituted
after
you
gave
notice
that
you
were
bringing
a
suit
in
state
court.
