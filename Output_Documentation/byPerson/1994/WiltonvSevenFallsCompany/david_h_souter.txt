but
isn't...
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
infer
that
there
is
a
derivative
or
implicit
discretion
to
determine
whether
to
go
ahead
and
have
a
trial
on
the
issue,
because
let's
assume
we
apply
colorado
river,
moses
cone,
or
any
other
set
of
criteria.
if
the
court
right
at
the
threshold
says
it's
perfectly
clear
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
it's
quite
unlikely
that
we
would,
in
fact,
grant
relief,
that
is
a
very
good
reason
for
the
court
at
that
stage
to
say,
we
therefore
are
going
to
abstain.
why
doesn't...
why
isn't
that
a
sensible
way
to
give
practical
effect
to
the
discretion
that
you
concede?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
--but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
just
ask
one
other?
your
reference
to
unfettered
discretion
i
think
sort
of
takes
its
significance
from
the
fact
that
you
continue
to
reiterate
throughout
your
argument
that
you
have
here
this
morning
that
there
is
this
unflagging
obligation
to
exercise
discretion,
which
i
took
you
to
mean
was
something
inconsistent
with
abstention,
absent
an
overwhelming
case
for
abstention,
and
that
really
is
not
so.
if,
in
fact,
there
is
the
derivative
discretion
that
i
was
talking
about,
then
we
are
not
in
a
situation
in
which
there
is
this
unflagging
obligation
as
we
are
in
the
circumstances
which
moses
cone
and
colorado
specifically
addressed.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
maybe
a
summary
judgment
process.
in
other
words,
time
has
got
to
be
spent
evaluating
perhaps
uncontested
facts,
but
time
has
got
to
be
spent
doing
something
more
than
would
be
done
if
you
simply
say
at
the
threshold
point,
get
out
of
here.
