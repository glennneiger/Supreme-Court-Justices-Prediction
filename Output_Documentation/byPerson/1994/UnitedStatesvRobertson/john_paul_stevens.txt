mr.
warren
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
russell
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
constitutional
argument
is
based
on
the
assumption
they
define
everything
that
go
into
the
class,
but
how
does
that
respond
to
the
argument
that
here
the
only
class
is
gold
mines?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
may
i
go
back
to
russell
for
a
second?
your
distinction,
if
i
understand
it,
is
that
there
it
talked
about
the
whole
class
of
activities,
and
here
it
talks
about
the
activities
of
the
particular
enterprise,
in
this
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
this
statute
had
read...
instead
of,
any
enterprise
which
is
engaged
in
or
the
activities
of
which
affect
interstate
commerce,
if
it
had
said,
any
enterprise
which
is
engaged
in
activities
which
affect
interstate
commerce,
then
you
would
agree
you
would
lose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question?
just
looking
at
the
general
purpose
of
the
statute
to
reach
competitive...
the
use
of,
in
competitive
markets,
of
funds
that
are
the
product
of
income
derived
from
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
basically
organized
crime,
and
i
understand
it's
been
given
broader
construction
than
perhaps
congress
intended,
but
looking
at
the
heart
of
the
statute
and
wanting
to
police
investments
of
this
kind
of
money,
why
would
congress
want
to
do
anything
less
than
its
full
power
to
reach
all
of
the
use
of
proceeds
of
this
kind
of
activity?
what
would
the
reason
be
for
the...
i
mean,
what
sense
does
your
distinction
make
in
terms
of
the
overall
purpose
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
threshold
inquiry
has
to
be...
there's
no
doubt
about
the
threshold
of,
you're
regulating
the
proceeds
of
activities
that
are
clearly
subject
to
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate,
the
organized
crimes...
you
know,
getting
the
money
in
the
first
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
we're
talking
about,
what
can
they
do
with
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
basically
a
full
power
answer
would
say,
they
can't
do
anything
with
i,
we
want
to
get
it
all,
and
you
say
that...
why
wouldn't
that
be
the
more
normal
reading
of
the
statute?
