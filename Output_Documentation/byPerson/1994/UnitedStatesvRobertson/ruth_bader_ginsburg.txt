but
you're
not
relying
on
necessary
and
proper
here,
are
you,
mr.
estrada?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
doesn't
our
recent
decision
in
the
allied
bruce
case
have
some
relevance
to
this
problem
of
what
affects
commerce?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
warren,
you
use
the
word,
has
to
have
a
substantial
effect,
so
does
it
turn
on
the
success
of
the
mine?
that
is,
we
look
to
the
reality
and
not
the
expectation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
mr.
robinson's
dream
had
come
true,
then
he
would
be
covered,
but
it's
just
because
his
mine
was
not
successful
that
he's
not.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
you
invest
and
strike
it
rich,
you're
covered
by
rico,
but
if
you
invest
and
it
turns
out
to
be
a
bust,
you're
not
covered?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
what
extent
do
you
rely
on
the
ninth
circuit
point
about
the
distance
of
alaska?
wouldn't
the
same
thing
apply
to
two
states
that
are
very
close
to
each
other,
just
as--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
warren,
in
connection
with
employees,
perhaps
the
alaska
distance
doesn't
make
a
distinction
that
cuts
against
you.
there
was
a
whole
line
of
cases
about
people
who
go
up
to
alaska
to
work
and
then
come
back
to
california
sick
and
lame
and
are
a
burden
on
the
california
workers
compensation
system,
so
wouldn't
the
effect
of
getting
employees
to
come
to
alaska,
wouldn't
that
have
an
amplified
effect
on
interstate
commerce--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--than
the
distance
between,
say,
new
york
and
new
jersey?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
warren,
the
ninth
circuit
was
obviously
concerned
about
the
sweep
of
this
provision,
and
there
was
an
issue
left
over.
i
think
the...
what
was
the
issue
that
was
left
over
about
sentencing
under
this
count?
