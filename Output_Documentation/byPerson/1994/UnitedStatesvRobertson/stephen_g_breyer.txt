g.

well,
is
that
really
true
that
the
government's
position
is
that
if
two
pizza
parlors
in
downtown
anchorage
fix
their
prices,
the
sherman
act
applies?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
didn't
accept
that,
would
it
be--
[laughter]
just
in
case
one
didn't
go
that
far,
is
this
distinguishable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
is
it
possible?
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
mean,
one
could
look
to
see
whether
or
not
congress
intended
each
individual
farmer,
the
class
of
which
affects
the
price
of
wheat,
also
to
fall
within
the
statute,
and
sometimes
the
answer
would
be
yes,
and
sometimes
no,
depending
on
what
the
statute's
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
the
output
of
gold
mines,
or
gold
mines,
even
local
mines,
because
like
wheat
they
affect,
what
reason
is
there
in
this
statute
to
believe
that
congress
would
not
have
wanted
to
bring
within
the
statute
every
single
enterprise
that
is
a
member
of
this
class?
here,
the
reason...
the
language
is
jurisdictional,
i
take
it,
in
the
statute.
in
the
sherman
act,
for
example,
they're
interested
in
going
after
only
certain
kinds
of
price-fixing
agreements,
but
here
the
language
is
jurisdictional.
they'd
like
every
pizza
parlor
to
fall
within
it
if
they
could,
wouldn't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
now
beyond
the
power
of
commerce...
congress
to
say,
this
gold...
in
other
words,
you're
saying
now,
congress
doesn't
have
the
constitutional
power
to
penalize
investment
in
this
kind
of
gold
mind,
this
kind
of
investment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
also
took
out
$30,000,
didn't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
didn't
they
take
out
some
nuggets
or
something?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
15
percent
of
the
output
was
taken
out
of
state?
