mr.
estrada,
in
your
view,
is
there
any
business
enterprise
in
america
that
wouldn't
be
covered
by
rico?
what
are
the
limits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
distinguish
the
situation
here
from
the
situation
which
was
argued
recently
here
in
the
lopez
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
does
the
sherman
antitrust
act
have
a
lesser
scope
of
coverage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
language
in
each
is
somewhat
different,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--now--
--so
if--
--counsel,
are
you
arguing
that
this
gold
mine
operation
doesn't
even
come
within
congress'
power
to
regulate,
or
is
it
your
position
that
congress
had
intended
to
exercise
less
than
its
full
power
under
the
rico
statute?
it
wasn't
clear
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
ones
that
aren't
successful?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
just
asked
you
that
same
question.
you
said,
no,
congress
could
reach
it,
but
it
didn't.
now,
what
is
your
position?
it
has
just
shifted
dramatically.
