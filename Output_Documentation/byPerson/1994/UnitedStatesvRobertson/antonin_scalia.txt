justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
case,
i
mean,
lopez
involved
a...
this
case
involves
a
commercial
enterprise--
justice
antonin
scalia
--doesn't
it?
the
only
question
is
whether
it's
interstate
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
lopez
didn't
involve
a
commercial
enterprise
at
all.
it
was
a
gun
in
a
schoolyard.
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
it's
commerce
doesn't
make
any
difference
for
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
expands
the
commerce
clause
to
cover
things
that
the
commerce
clause
wouldn't
otherwise
cover?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
wonderful.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
i
have
to
agree
with
that
to
agree
with
the
government
in
this
case?
because
i
don't
agree
with
it
as
to
the
sherman
act,
as
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
sherman
act
doesn't
use
"affecting
interstate
commerce"
at
all,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
language
is
"in
restraint
of
trade
between
the
states.
"
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
matter
how
the
rest
of
the
sentence
reads,
so
long
as
the
word
"affecting"
is
in
it,
that's
it,
it's
sort
of
a...
it
does
everything.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
the
best
way
to
read
it
either,
i
don't
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
would
it
have
expressed
the
thought
that
a
normal,
english-speaking
person
would
express
by
saying,
any
enterprise
the
activities
of
which
affect
interstate
or
foreign
commerce?
suppose
i
wanted
to
really
require
that
the
activities
of
that
enterprise
affect
interstate
commerce,
rather
than
the
activities
that
that
enterprise
engages
in
when
engaged
in
by
others
in
the
aggregate
affect
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
would
i
express
the
thought
that
i
would
normally
express
by
saying,
any
enterprise,
the
activities
of
which
affect
interstate
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
cannot
say
it
any
more
in
english?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
really
think
that
that's
what
our
cases
now,
that
whenever
congress
uses
the
word
"affecting"
the
rest
of
the
sentence
doesn't
matter?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
what
we've
said,
maybe
we
should
unsay
it,
because
it
certainly
is
a
trap
for
the
unwary
legislator
who
thinks
that
he's
speaking
english,
and
it
turns
out
that
if
he
uses
the
word
"affecting"
all
sorts
of
unreal
things
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
our
cases
are
presumed
to
say
reasonable
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
maybe
we
should
adhere
to
that
presumption.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
government's
view
is
so
expansive,
it
really
doesn't
even
matter
if
you
use
"affecting"
does
it,
because
it's
not
used
in
the
sherman
act,
and
you
take
the
same
"it
covers
everything"
view
of
the
sherman
act,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you
use
"affecting",
or,
alternatively,
do
not
use
"affecting",
it
covers
everything.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
not
the
different
powers
that
congress
has,
the
commerce
power.
does
it
have
power
to
regulate
even
this
mine
under
the
commerce
power
if
it
wanted
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
a
lemonade
stand
that
doesn't
go
anywhere
doesn't
affect
interstate
commerce,
and
if
it
turns
into
mcdonald's,
it
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
was
your
position,
too.
i
thought
you
were
just
saying
congress
could
do
that,
but
didn't
do
it
here.
i
thought
it
was
essentially
an
interpretive
argument
you
were
making,
rather
than
a
constitutional
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
warren,
what's
your
best
case?
what
case
displays
an
interpretation
by
this
court
of
the
word,
"affecting"
that
would
make
you
win
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
involve
the
word,
"affecting".
i
mean,
i
agree,
that's
a
wonderful
line
of
cases.
unfortunately,
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
this.
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--restraint
of
trade
between
the
states
is
what
you're
talking
about,
and
the
court
said,
you
know,
that
that
seems
to
focus
on
the
individual
activity,
or
at
least
we
used
to
say
that,
but
you
don't
have
a
single
case
in
which
"affecting"
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
as
you
urge
us
to
interpret
it
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
i
guess
you
could
say
the
same
reason
we
think,
or
used
to
think
that
the
sherman
act
doesn't
cover
small
businesses
that
don't
substantially,
individually
substantially
affect
interstate
commerce,
that
the
federal
government
left
it
to
state
valentine
acts
to
do
that
job
with
respect
to
smaller
enterprises.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
the
national
labor
relations
act.
a
lot
of
acts
have
been
inter...
or
have
been
limited
by
either
the
statute
or
the
regulations
that
implement
them
to
major
interstate
activities,
leaving
the
states
to
do
the
rest.
