mr.
glenn
s.
warren
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
commerce
clause
has
any
limitations.
does
the
term,
"interstate
commerce"
mean
anything,
or
is
it
a
jurisdictional
fiction?
this
court's
precedents
require
that
the
phrase,
rico
statute,
require
that
there
be
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
the
government
effectively
urges
upon
this
court
a
standard
of
identifiable
and
perceptible.
that
is,
if
there
is
an
activity,
whether
it
be
a
pizza
parlor
or
the
buying
of
tissue
paper,
that
activity
is
identifiable,
it
has
a
potential
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
and
under
the
government's
theory
would
be
cognizable
under
the
rico
statute.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
justice
kennedy,
that
instruction
was
applied
to
section
1956,
which
was
one
of
the
racketeering
acts
which
was
a
part
of
count
6,
which
was
the
general
rico
count.
the
general
rico
count
used
the
language,
"affects
interstate
commerce".
it
did
not
use
the
language,
"in
any
way
affects
interstate
commerce.
"
it
would
be
our
position
that
this
is
a
jurisdictional
question
which
was
not
waived,
in
any
event,
by
the
failure
to
object.
furthermore,
there
was
a
request
by
trial
counsel
to
submit
a
special
instruction
on
the
rico
count.
that
request
was
denied
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
the
rico
statute
talks
about,
and
the
statute
that
mr.
robertson,
the
respondent,
was
prosecuted
under,
talks
about
actual
effects.
it
does
not,
as
in
the
sherman
act,
talk
about
an
agreement
which
has
potential
consequences.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
that
is
my
position,
because
i
believe
that
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
talks
about
effects
of
the
enterprise
on
interstate
commerce
and
not
potential
effects.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
i
believe
that
congress
does
have
the
power
in
different
ways
to
regulate
gold
mines
such
as
the
one
that
existed
in
this
case.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
even
ones
that
are
not
successful
under
congress'
different
powers
that
congress
has,
but
it's
my
position
that
rico
statute,
which
refers
to
the
gold
mine
as
the
enterprise,
does
not
cover
the
gold
mine
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
i
believe
that
it
would
have
that
power
if
it
wanted
to,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
rico
statute
in
this
instance
reached
this
gold
mine.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
that
may
be
the
possible
consequence
of
the
statute
the
way
it
is
written.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
well,
under
the
government's
theory,
i
believe
that
the
lemonade
stand
would
affect
interstate
commerce,
because
any
activity
has
some
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
my
position
is
that
there
must
be
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
and
therefore
the
lemonade
stand
would
not,
but
a
mcdonald's
franchise
might,
depending
on
the
particular
activities.
the--
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
--the
russell
case
is...
the
russell
case
looked
at
title
viii
of
the
organized
crime
control
act
of
1970,
and
uses
language
which
is
different
than
the
rico
statute.
russell,
or
section
844(i)
of
title
xviii,
talks
about
buildings,
vehicles,
and
property
that
are
used
in
activities
which
affect
interstate
commerce.
the
rico
statute,
on
the
other
hand,
talks
about
enterprises
which
affect
interstate
commerce.
the
rico
statute
does
not
address
enterprises
which
are
used
in
activities
which
affect
interstate
commerce.
therefore,
i
believe
that
there
is
a
significant
difference,
and
that
congress
was
aware
of
that
difference
when
it
passed
both
of
those
statutes,
since
they
were
both
parts
of
the
organized
crime
control
act
of
1970.
furthermore,
in
the
organized
crime
control
act
of
1970,
congress
in...
i'm
sorry,
the
arson
statute
is
title
xi.
title
viii
was
the
gambling
statute,
which
says
that
if
certain
requirements
are
met,
a
certain
number
of
people
gamble
and
so
on,
then
there
is
a
per
se
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
so
i
believe
that
in
passing
the
organized
crime
control
act
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
different
approaches
it
could
take
to
interstate
commerce.
with
the
arson
statute,
it
used
language,
buildings
and
so
on
engaged
in
activities
which
affect
interstate
commerce,
rico
it
used
language,
enterprises
which
affect
interstate
commerce,
and
in
the
gambling
statute,
it
defined
a
class
of
activities.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
i
agree,
justice
breyer,
congress
may
have
wanted
to
bring
every
enterprise
under
its
jurisdiction,
but
i
would
submit
that
is
beyond
the
commerce
power
of
congress.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
that
is
my
position
with
the
approach
that
congress
used
in
this
particular
case.
it
has
defined--
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
--with
all
respect,
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
if
congress
had
defined
a
class
of
gold
mines
that
it
wished
to
regulate,
then
the
individual
mines
within
that
class
could
be
aggregated
to
establish
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
but
when
congress
uses
the
generic
term,
"enterprise",
which
covers
virtually
every
activity
within
the
united
states,
it's
a
class
that
is
so
broad
that
it
is
tantamount
to
trying
to
exercise
the
commerce
power
itself
over
every
activity.
the
rationale,
i
would
submit,
of
the
class
analysis,
is
that
classes
are
subsets
of
the
whole,
and
that
congress
can
properly
pick
out
particular
classes
and
regulate
those
classes.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
if
congress
did
not
make
the
subclass
classification,
then
effectively
it
would
be
regulating
every
enterprise
from
the
lemonade
stand
to
general
motors.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
well,
the
statute
itself,
in
addition
the
two...
the
class
which
would
be
enterprises
which
have
elicit
funds
invested
in
them,
has
words
of
limitation,
which--
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
--i
would
agree
with
that
position,
that
it's
not
a
textual
question.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
well,
i
believe
as
a
matter
of
logic,
if
nothing
else,
that
if
congress
can
define
a
class
as
including
all
enterprises
in
the
united
states,
then
effectively
the
commerce
power
has
no
limitation,
and
as
even
the
government
concedes--
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
--well,
i
think
the
government's
position
is
that
congress
could
legislate
over
all
enterprises
in
the
united
states,
and
then
could
use
those,
could
aggregate
those
and
declare,
or
ask
the
court
to
interpret
that
aggregation
as
having
the
substantial
effect
on
commerce,
and
therefore
there
would
be
no
distinction
between
interstate
and
intrastate
commerce.
every
type
of
commerce
would
be
subject
to
congressional
legislation.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
i'm
making
two
arguments,
justice
scalia.
i
do
not
believe,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
that
congress
can
with
this
kind
of
class
approach
exercise
jurisdiction
over
every
class.
i
am
also
making
a
statutory
argument
that
it
did
not
do
so
in
this
case.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
well,
gold
mines
are
not
defined
either
by
congress
in
the
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history.
unlike
the
russell
case,
for
example,
where
the
legislative
history
reflected
that
there
was
a
congressional
concern
about
buildings,
and
this
court
was
then
able
to
interpret
the
class
of
activities
as
being
commercial
real
estate,
there's
nothing
in
this
statute
or
its
legislative
history
to
indicate
any
concern
about
gold
mines,
so--
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
--right,
the...
and--
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
--yes.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
i
disagree
with
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
words,
"affect
interstate
commerce"
have
a
general
meaning
which
we
can
look
at
and
take
into
every
statute.
i
believe
that
those
words
have
been
used
in
different
ways,
and
that
we
have
to
take
a
close
look
at
the
way
the
words
are
used
in
a
particular
statute,
and
it's
my
position
that
those
words
reflect
an
intent
that
only
substantial
effects
on
interstate
commerce
be
cognizable
under
the
rico
statute.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
i
agree
with
you,
justice
ginsburg.
i
do
not
rely
on
the
ninth
circuit
to
that
extent,
because
i
think
that
almost
any
activity
in
the
united
states
or
in
any
given
state
draws
supplies
and
purchases
supplies
from
another
state,
whether
we're
talking
about
alaska,
or
california,
or
new
york,
or
wyoming,
so
i
do
not
rely
on
the
ninth
circuit
distinction
in
that
regard.
as
far
as
the
activities
of
the
enterprise,
the
government
would
lump
anything
that
happened
in
connection
with
the
gold
mine
and
call
it
interstate
commerce.
the
activities
of
the
gold
mine,
in
our
view,
were
those
activities
which
were
ongoing
and
which
were
unique
to
this
particular
mine,
and
that
would
be
the
extraction
of
minerals
from
the
ground,
and
the
sale
of
minerals
in
alaska.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
well,
that
is,
i
would
argue
first,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
is
not
technically
an
activity
of
the
mine.
it's--
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
--well,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
an
activity,
and
can
be
viewed
as
an
activity,
i
would
argue
that
it
did
not
constitute
any
kind
of
substantial
effect
in
this
case.
it's
a...
it's
the
type
of
activity,
if
you
will,
that
is
a
part
of
every
business.
there
are
probably
few
businesses
that
do
not
have
people
who
come
from
other
states
to
work
at
one
time
or
another.
it's
not
a
significant
part
of
the
activity
of
the
mine,
if
it
is
considered
an
activity
of
the
mine.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
i
believe
the
analogy
to
the
sherman
act,
some
of
the
sherman
act
cases.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
agree
that
the
sherman
act
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
rico,
because
the
sherman
act
does
talk
about
the...
about
effects
on
interstate
commerce,
or
at
least
the
court's
interpretation
of
the
sherman
act
in
various
cases
talks
about
that.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
"affecting"
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
in
class
of
activities
cases,
and
the
court
has
indicated
that
when
there
is
a
class,
there
must
be
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
i
do
not
have
a
case
which
discusses
this
issue
in
terms
of
a
nonclass
analysis
and
addresses
an
individual
activity,
but
it's
my
position
that
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
requires
that
there
be
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
otherwise
the
distinction
between
interstate
and
intrastate
commerce
is
lost,
and
there
is
no
limit
to
the
commerce
power.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
looking--
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
--looking
at
any
particular
activity,
there
might
be
a
heightened
effect
if
there
are
a
number
of
employees
coming
from
one
state
to
another.
i
would
point
out
that
in
this
case
there
were
a
total
of
only
five
or
six
employees
who
worked
at
this
particular
mine
over
the
span
of
3
years,
so
even
if
these
employees
did
travel
in
interstate
commerce,
it
was...
as
the
ninth
circuit
pointed
out,
it
was
certainly
not
of
any
importance.
in
fact,
i
would
almost
refer
to
some
of
these
incidents
such
as
the
travel
of
employees,
the
driving
of
a
cadillac,
which
the
government
refers
to,
as
incidental
effects,
a
term
which
this
court
used
in
oregon
state
medical
society
to
describe
sporadic
and
few
contacts
with
interstate
commerce,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
same
is
true
in
this
situation.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
there
could
be
some
concern
about
the
federal-state
balance.
that
could
be
one
reason
why
congress
would
not
want
to
cover
every
single
enterprise.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
yes.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
yes.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
well,
even
if
it
were
the
more
normal
reading
of
the
statute,
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
but
there
may
be
certain
types
of
activities
that
congress
wants
to
reach,
and
it
wants
to
use
its
full
powers
to
reach
those
activities,
but
the
commerce
power
just
does
not
allow
it
to
reach
those
activities.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
that
would--
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
--i
would
agree
with
that.
i
would
again
refer
the
court
to
the
sherman
act,
because
even
though
the
language
of
the
sherman
act
does
not
talk
about
affecting
interstate
commerce,
i
believe
it
provides
a
useful
analog
to
an
analysis.
this
court's
sherman
act
cases
have
historically
talked
about
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
and
i
would
submit
that
is
what
the
rico
statute
talks
about.
the
gold
mine
in
alaska
sold
gold
intrastate
to
refiners
in
alaska.
there's
no
evidence,
although
there
is
an
inference,
that
that
gold
was
subsequently
sold
outside
of
alaska,
but
in
the
scheme
of
what
probably
is
a
multitrillion-dollar
market,
as
the
court
below
pointed
out,
$200,000
over
a
period
of
3
years
is
not
a
significant
amount
of
activity.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
i'm
sorry?
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
there
was
approximately
$30,000--
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
--that's
correct,
but
that...
that
was
not
an
activity
of
the
mine.
if
anything,
that
was
a...
that
could
be
looked
at
as
one
of
the
participants
in
the
mine,
mr.
robertson,
the
respondent,
just
taking
the
money
out
of
alaska.
this
was
not
an
activity
of
the
mine
where
it
sold
mine...
sold
gold
in
alaska,
or
sold
gold
outside
of
alaska.
this
was
somebody
just
taking
the
gold.
if
that
were
to
provide
a
jurisdictional
basis,
the
fact
that
somebody
could
take
something
from
an
enterprise
and
travel
to
another
state,
then
again,
almost
any
activity
could
have
some
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
glenn
s.
warren
well,
this
count,
the
rico
count
brings
the...
brings
mr.
robertson's
sentence
within
the
sentencing
guidelines,
and
without
the
rico
count,
then
all
other
counts
that
he
was
convicted
on
would
not
be
within
the
sentencing
guidelines,
because
they
occurred
prior
to
november
1,
1987.
the
government
acknowledges
in
principle
that
the
commerce
clause
has
limits.
its
approach,
however,
is
to
abandon
what
i
would
submit
is
the
longstanding
substantial
effect
test
of
this
court,
and
would
give
congress
an
unbridled
power
to
punish
any
kind
of
criminal
conduct.
this
could
result
in
the
punishment
of
criminal
conduct
which
has
really
nothing
to
do
with
interstate
commerce.
it
can
result
in
overburdening
of
the
federal
courts,
an
expansive
use
of
the
rico
statute
in
both
the
criminal
and
the
civil
context
and,
i
would
submit,
it
could
act,
will
act
to
significantly
affect
the
federal-state
balance.
by
upholding
the
language
of
the
rico
statute
in
this
particular
case,
which
is
to
view
"affects
interstate
commerce"
as
giving
congress
the
power
to
legislate
over
any
type
of
effect,
congress
can
simply
pass
a
statute,
indicate
that
it
is
exercising
its
commerce
clause
jurisdiction
over
an
activity
or
activities
which
affect
interstate
commerce,
and
there
basically
is
no
check.
i
would
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
ruling
of
the
court
below.
