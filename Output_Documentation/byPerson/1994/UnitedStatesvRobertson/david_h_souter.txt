justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
estrada,
would
the
following
argument
be
sound?
it
would
go
like
this,
that
if
congress
wanted
to
make
it
unequivocally
clear
that
it
was
legislating
to
the
fullest
extent
of
its
powers,
it
would
have
described
the
activity
of
the
enterprise
in
this
way:
it
would
have
spoken
of
an
enterprise
which
engages
in
activities
that
affect
interstate
commerce.
that
would
have
made
it
clear
that
the
enterprise
was
simply
one
participant
in
a
broader
activity,
or
congeries
of
activities
that
have,
in
the
aggregate,
this
substantial
effect,
but
that
what
congress
in
fact
did
was
to
speak
of
an
enterprise,
the
activities
of
which
affect
commerce,
which
suggests
that
we
are
speaking
or
looking
not
to
an
aggregate,
but
to
the
particular
activities
of
that
enterprise,
and
to
them
alone.
is
that
sort
of
contrast
in
language
the
basis
for
a
sound
argument
that
congress
was
taking
a
narrower
view
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
whenever
you
see
it,
it's
basically
a
signal
for
the
shorthand,
whatever
we
can
do
we're
doing?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
argument
in
effect
i
guess
is...
and
i'm
not
saying
it's
an
illegitimate
argument,
but
i
guess
that
argument
in
effect
is
that
wherever
congress
uses
the
term,
"affecting
commerce",
by
using
the
broadest,
most
umbrella
kind
of
term,
it
therefore
is
including
any
of
the
kind
of
more
restrictive
tests,
like
involving
the
instrumentalities,
or
involving
goods
that
have
moved,
and
so
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
what
we've
come
with
in
your
answers
to
me
and
to
justice
scalia
are
a
kind
of
three
variants,
one
of
which
would
make
it
expressly
clear
that
we
were
talking
about
an
enterprise
whose
activities,
when
aggregated
with
others,
affected.
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
the
answer
that
you
gave
to
justice
scalia,
something
to
the
effect
like,
the
activities
of
which
alone
affect
interstate
commerce,
and
what
we've
got
in
the
statute
is
something
in
between.
and
i
suppose
you
could,
simply
on
the
basis
of
these
answers,
argue
that
we
have
an
ambiguous
statute
here,
even
though
each
of
those
three
variants
uses
the
word
"affect",
and
i
suppose
if
we
get
to
that
point,
the
thing
to
do
is
to
look
to
legislative
history.
you
don't
want
to
say
that
to
justice
scalia,
but
you
could
say
that
to
me.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
can,
but
why
does
it
follow
from
that
that
congress
may
not
do
it
otherwise?
in
other
words,
why
does
it
have
to
make
that
subclass
identification?
i
don't
see
your
basis
for
assuming
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean,
that
doesn't
follow.
i
mean,
there
still
are
the
substantially
affecting
commerce
tests.
it
doesn't
mean
that
it
takes
over
every
activity
in
the
country.
it
simply
means
it
goes
as
far
as
it
can
go,
and
what
reason
is
there
to
assume,
textually
or
constitutionally,
that
it
can
only
go
as
far
as
it
can
go
if
it
does
it
by
the
specific
identification
of
what
you
call
subclasses
to
be
regulated?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
a
different
argument.
i
mean,
you're
now
making
a
textual
argument,
and
i
understood
you
before
to
be
saying
that
if
congress
wants
to
legislate
to
its
limit,
it
must
do
so
as
a
constitutional
matter,
i
suppose,
by
identifying
each
so-called
subclass
which
it
wishes
to
regulate
to
the
extent
of
its
power,
and
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
an
argument
based
on
the
text
of
this
statute.
i
understood
that
to
be
an
argument
based
on
the
way
congress
has
to
exercise
its
constitutional
power.
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
if
it's
not
a
textual
question,
what,
then,
is
the
constitutional
basis
for
your
imposition
of
this,
identify
the
subclass
requirement,
before
congress
can
legislate
to
the
extent
of
its
powers?
where
do
you
get
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
has
no
limitation
beyond
the
substantially
affecting
commerce
limitation,
and
congress
would
say,
that's
absolutely
right.
that's
just
what
we
intend
to
do.
