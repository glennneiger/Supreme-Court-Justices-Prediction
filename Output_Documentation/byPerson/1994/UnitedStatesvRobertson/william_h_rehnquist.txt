chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-251,
the
united
states
v.
juan
paul
robertson.
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
it's
we
rather
than
you
who
brought
the
case
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
was
the
last
time
since
mcculloch
v.
maryland
that
we
held
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
case
would
you
say
relied
on
the
necessary
and
proper
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
gibbons
v.
ogden
relied
on
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
the
way
mcculloch
did.
gibbons
v.
ogden
was
just
a
broad
definition
of
the
commerce
power.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
the
power
is
justified.
it's
justified
by
whom?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
are
the
cases
that
you
can't
remember
from
the
thirties
and
forties?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
estrada,
your
opponent
relies,
in
part
at
least,
on
gulf
oil
v.
copp
paving.
how
do
you
distinguish
that
case
from
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
warren,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
about
hiring
employees
to
come
to
alaska
from
somewhere
else?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
finding
people
to
run
the
operation
is
an
activity
of
the
mine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
warren.
mr.
estrada,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
94-251
united
states
against
robertson.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
that
court
overturned
the
respondent?s
conviction
for
violating
a
section
of
rico
which
makes
it
illegal
to
invest
the
proceeds
of
unlawful
activity
in
any
enterprise
which
is
engaged
in
or
affects
interstate
commerce.
it
concluded
that
the
government
had
failed
to
introduce
evidence
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
alaskan
goldmine
in
which
respondent
had
invested
his
unlawful
proceeds
was
engaged
in
or
affected
interstate
commerce.
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
we
reversed
the
court
of
appeals.
at
trial
the
government
proved
the
respondent?s
goldmine
purchased
equipment
and
supplies
and
recruit
employees
from
outside
alaska.
the
goldmine
was
surely
engaged
interstate
commerce
and
the
judgment
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
