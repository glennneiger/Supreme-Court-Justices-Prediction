mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent
was
a
california
lawyer
who
became
involved
in
drug
dealing
and
other
crimes.
with
money
obtained
from
his
crimes,
he
invested
in
a
venture
to
mine
gold
in
alaska.
he
was
eventually
convicted
of
narcotics
offenses
and
of
violating
the
racketeering
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act,
known
as
rico.
rico
makes
it
a
crime
for
any
person
to
use
income
derived
from
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
to
acquire
an
interest
in
any
enterprise
"which
is
engaged
in,
or
the
activities
of
which
affect
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
"
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
narcotics
conviction,
but
it
reversed
the
rico
conviction
for
lack
of
proof
that
the
activities
of
the
gold
mining
venture
affected
interstate
commerce.
the
court
held
that
a
minimal
effect
on
interstate
commerce
would
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
rico,
but
that
an
incidental
effect
on
that
commerce
would
not.
the
court
then
found
that
the
government's
evidence,
including
the
fact
that
the
gold
mining
venture
had
hired
employees
outside
of
alaska
and
purchased
equipment
outside
of
alaska,
showed,
at
most,
an
incidental
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
the
ninth
circuit
emphasized
that
alaska's
geographical
isolation
means
that
most
supplies
and
equipment
must
get
there
via
interstate
commerce,
and
it
believed
that
alaska's
dependence
on
interstate
commerce
should
not
mean
that
local
businesses
in
alaska
are
covered
by
rico.
we
brought
the
case
here
because
the
ninth
circuit
decision
conflicts
with
the
view
of
every
other
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
what
sort
of
a
jurisdictional
proof
satisfies
the
requirements
of
rico.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
i
stand
corrected,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
argument
in
the
case,
now
that
it
is
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
starts
with
the
language
of
rico,
and
that
language
reaches
all
enterprises
the
activities
of
which
affect
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
this
court's
cases
made
clear
that
the
phrase,
affect
commerce,
is
a
term
of
art
that
congress
uses
to
exercise
all
commerce
power
it
has
under
the
constitution,
and
that
congress
intended
to
exercise
all
of
its
constitutional
power
in
rico
is
confirmed
not
only
by
its
use
of
that
term
of
art,
but
also
by
the
fact
that
one
of
its
principal
goals
in
enacting
rico,
which
was
to
safeguard
small
businesses
from
infiltration
by
organized
crime,
could
likely
not
be
achieved
under
any
narrower
view
of
the
jurisdictional
requirement.
under
rico,
then,
in
our
view,
the
question
is
whether
the
activities
of
the
enterprise,
here
the
gold
mining
venture,
affect
commerce
when
measured
by
the
full
constitutional
authority
of
congress
and,
under
that
standard,
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
sufficient
to
meet
the
government's
burden.
the
ninth
circuit
conceded
that
respondent
and
his
employees
traveled
between
alaska
and
the
lower
48
states
in
connection
with
the
work
in
the
mine,
that
the
mine
obtained
supplies
and
equipment
from
the
lower
48
states,
and
the
respondent
mortgaged
a
home
he
owned
in
arizona
to
finance
the
second
mining
season
in
1986.
in
addition,
the
evidence
showed
that
the
mine
sold
a
substantial
amount
of
gold
in
alaska
worth
at
least
$200,000,
that
the
purchasers
of
the
gold
were
part
of
a
broader
market
in
precious
metals
that
reached
beyond
alaska,
and
that
therefore
the
mine's
output
was
part
of
a
class
of
activities
that
in
the
aggregate
substantially
affects
interstate
commerce.
in
addition,
the
evidence
showed
that
respondent
and
his
associates
used
the
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce
repeatedly,
the
mail
and
the
telephones,
as
part
of
the
business
of
the
mine.
in
our
view,
all
of
that
evidence
was
clearly
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
government's
burden
under--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--as
a
factual
matter,
justice
o'connor,
i
cannot
think
of
any
business
in
the
country
that
could
not
be
covered
by
rico,
given
that
what
is
at
issue
is
the
full
constitutional
authority
of
congress.
i
understand
that
the
commerce
principle
is
a
limited
one,
and
we
do
agree
with
that.
however,
the
facts
on
which
it
operates
are
not
limited,
and
in
our
economy
on
this
day,
i
cannot
think
of
anything
that
is
likely
to
actually
happen
in
the
real
world
that
would
not
be
covered
by
this
court's
cases
construing
the
extent
of
congress'
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
this
case
is
significantly
different
from
lopez.
as
i
understand
the
claim
of
the
respondent
in
lopez
and
the
view
that
was
followed
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
that
case,
congress
is
required
to
make
findings
and
to
set
forth
some
sort
of
an
explanation
as
to
why
it
views
the
activities
that
it
is
trying
to
reach
as
affecting
commerce.
we
do
not
think
that
that
is
the
case,
but
even
if
it
were
in
this
case,
i
think
congress
did
that
and
more.
congress
in
this
case
considered
the
statute
very
carefully.
it
was
dealing
with
a
broad
national
problem
that
it
thought
the
old
laws,
both
state
and
federal,
had
been
entirely
inadequate
to
deal
with.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
that's
right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
the--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
that
is
true,
justice
scalia.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
for
purposes
of
the--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
does
make
a
difference
for
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause,
justice
scalia.
it
may
not
make
a
difference
for
purposes
of
whether,
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
congress
can
reach
something
that
is
not
in
itself
commerce
in
order
to
safeguard--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--in
effect,
yes--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--justice
scalia,
but--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--oh,
mr.
justice
rehnquist...
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
my
reading
of
wickard
v.
filburn
would
be
to
that
effect.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
my
recollection.
i
must
say
that
i'm
not
entirely
sure.
there
are
several
cases
which
unfortunately
i
can't
think
of
in
the
1930's
and
'40's,
and
especially
in
the
'40's,
in
which
the
court
restated
the
view
of
gibbons
v.
ogden
and
pointed
out
that
that
was
merely
an
application
of--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that's
right,
although
in
later
cases
in
the
1940's
this
court
expressed
the
view
that...
the
broad
view
that
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
had
expounded
in
the
ogden
case
was
in
fact
merely
an
exposition,
even
though
he
didn't
himself
say
so,
of
the
power
of
congress
because
of
the
combination
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--mm-hmm.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
my
understanding,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
there
are
cases
in
the
1940's,
and
i'm
fairly
sure
of
it,
because
understand
that
we
have
read
them
recently,
xx
just
can't
cite
you
one.
maybe
when
i
rise
again
i
will
be
able
to.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
in
effect...
i
will
answer
that
question
in
two
steps,
justice
ginsburg.
we
don't
need
to
in
the
sense
that
i
think
the
evidence
in
this
case,
inasmuch
as
the
enterprise
engaged
in
interstate
transactions,
doesn't
call
upon
us
to
do
so.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
i...
but
the
only
reason
that
it
is
necessary
to
point
to
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
commerce
clause
in
itself,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
authorizes
congress
to
regulate
only
commerce,
and
the
so-called
affectation
doctrine
that
allows
congress
to
deal
with
other
matters
that
are
not
in
themselves
commerce,
but
they
have
an
effect
on
commerce,
is
usually
justified
by
reference
to
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
even
though
the
cases
talk
about
it
as
the
commerce
power.
it
is
not
in
itself
the
commerce
power
in
the
sense
that
that
term
is
used
in
the
constitution.
it
is
a
statement
of
how
far
congress
can
go
when
it
combines
the
commerce
power
and
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
by...
this
court's
cases
have
made
reference
in
explaining
why
congress
has
been
held
to
have
authority
to
reach
matters
that
are
not
in
themselves
commerce
to
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
in
fact,
and
the
court
has
explained
on
occasion,
that
even
though
the
cases
speak
of
congress'
power
to
reach
anything
that
affects
commerce,
some
of
the
more
cases...
some
of
the
court's
cases
have
been
more
specific,
and
have
pointed
out
that
congress
under
the
commerce
clause
can
reach
only
commerce
in
itself,
but
that
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
congress
can
then
reach
other
things
that
are
not
in
themselves
commerce,
but
that
affect
commerce,
and
this
court's
cases
dealing
with
whether
something
affects
commerce
and
saying
that
congress
has
power
to
reach
those
matters
are
usually...
are
logically
traceable
to
reasoning
based
ultimately
on
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
i
was
going
to
turn
to
the
justifications
given
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
though
that
despite
all
of
the
evidence
of
interstate
conduct
in
this
case,
the
fact
that
the
enterprise
hired
employees
and
purchased
equipment
outside
of
alaska,
that
a
different
result
was
warranted
by
its
description
of
the
effects
on
commerce
as
incidental
rather
than
minimal.
and
that
was
wrong,
because
this
court
stated
in
wickard
v.
filburn
that
questions
as
to
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
really
should
not
be
solved
by
reference
to
any
formula
that
gives
controlling
weight
to
nomenclature,
and
that
the
real
question
is
whether
actual
effects
can
be
identified
on
commerce,
and
in
this
case,
they
surely
could.
the
second
reason
that
the
ninth
circuit
gave
was
based
on
the
isolation
of
the
state
of
alaska,
and
we
do
not
think
that
that
isolation
should
count
against
our
case.
it
is
certainly
true
that
many
of
the
businesses
in
alaska
have
to
obtain
supplies
and
equipment
from
interstate
commerce,
but
that
state
is
hardly
unique
in
that
respect,
and
much
the
same
could
be
said
about
rhode
island
or
wyoming.
no
state
of
the
union
is
entirely
self-sufficient,
and
in
our
view
it
makes
little
sense
to
say
that
the
greater
a
state's
dependence
on
interstate
commerce,
the
less
likely
it
will
be
that
the
activities
within
that
state
will
be
deemed
to
affect
interstate
commerce.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
we
think
that
the
sherman
act,
the
hobbs
act,
and
rico,
all
go
to
the
limits
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
therefore
if--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
right.
the
language
in
each
of
them
is
somewhat
different.
some
of
them
use
the
word
nlrb
cases,
particularly
the
polish
case
versus
the
nlrb,
all
of
those
are
terms
of
art
that
are
used
to
invoke
the
full
authority
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause,
and
therefore
all
of
those
terms
have
been
interpreted
by
this
court,
when
congress
uses
them,
as
going
to
the
limits
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
i
do
know,
justice
scalia.
in
this
case,
no,
because
in
our
view
the
evidence
in
this
case,
and
this
is
how
we
tried
to
prove
most
of
these
cases,
was
actually
sufficient
to
show
that
the
enterprise
was
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
it
hired
its
employees
outside
of
alaska,
and
it
purchased
equipment
and
supplies--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
it
does
not.
it
is--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that's
right,
and
i
know
the
view
that
you
expressed
in
summit
health.
as
i
understand
your
view
in
that
case,
the
view
was
that
the
activity
in
that
case
could
be
reached
by
congress,
but
that
in
passing
the
sherman
act,
congress
did
not
exercise
its
full
authority.
in
this
case,
it
seems
fairly
plain
to
us
at
least
that
congress
in
using
the
words,
rico
was
passed,
congress
had
been
told
again
and
again
by
this
court
that
if
it
wished
to
invoke
its
full
power
under
the
commerce
clause,
these
were
the
words
it
had
to
use,
and
therefore,
no,
even
if
you
continue
to
hold
your
view
as
to
the
sherman
act,
justice
scalia,
that
should
not
keep
you
from
sort
of...
from
taking
our
view
of
this
case
under
this
statute.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
case
stated
that
when
congress
engages,
or
defines
a
class
of
activities,
the
court's
role
in
effect
is
significantly
different,
but
from
the
examples
that
the
court
cited
in
that
footnote
12,
especially
the
perez
case,
it
is
evident
that
what
the
court
was
getting
at
is
that
when
congress
itself
does
what
it
did
in
the
perez
case,
that
no
further
proof
of
interstate
commerce
at
all
is
called
for
in
any
given
case.
that
doesn't
really
answer
the
question
here,
because
congress
exercised
its
full
power
under
the
commerce
clause,
and
that
full
power
could
be
met
by
a
class
of
activities
analysis,
or
any
other
way
in
which
congress
could
lawfully
exercise
its
power,
and
the
significant
difference
that
the
court
was
talking
to
in
that
case
was
the
difference
between
having
to
prove
the
fact
in
every
case
and
having
to
have
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
the
fact
in
any
one
case.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
the
instruction
given
by
the
court
is
basically
the
ninth
circuit
pattern
jury
instruction.
i
think
it's
8.34,
and
it
doesn't
really
go
into
detail
as
to
interstate
commerce.
the...
that
was
not
objected
to,
and
as
can
be
expected
in
most
of
these
cases,
when
the
case
was
tried
to
the
jury,
this
wasn't
really
what
the
case
was
turning
on.
i
mean,
the
main
contention
on
the
other
side
was
that
he
had
not
in
fact
been
involved
in
drug
trafficking.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
right.
that's
right,
and
we
think
that
that's
clearly
wrong
under
this
court's
cases.
the
ninth
circuit's
view
is
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
so
insufficient
that
the
respondent
was
entitled
to
a
judgment
of
acquittal
on
the
rico
count,
and
that
that's
the
end
of
that
count.
obviously,
we
cannot
go
back
to
the
jury
and
try
it
again.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
because--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes.
that
would
be
an
instruction
that
is
tailored
to
the
facts,
and
it
is
all
right
for
a
court
to
instruct
the
jury
on
the
legal
significance
of
facts
so
long
as
it
makes
clear
that
the
question
as
to
whether
the
facts
exist
is
for
the
jury.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter.
congress
usually
will
write
the
words,
"affect
commerce"
at
the
end
of
the
language
that
otherwise
makes
conduct
a
crime
on
the
understanding
that
that
goes
to
the
full
power
of
its
commerce--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
and
i
would
give
as
an
example
to
you
the
scarborough
case,
which
dealt
with
coming
into
possession
of
a
firearm
in
commerce,
or
in
affecting
commerce.
this
court
held
in
that
case,
in
the
scarborough
case,
that
even
though
the
language
said,
possession
affecting
commerce,
that
that
requirement
would
be
satisfied
by
proof
that
the
firearm
had
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
at
some
point
in
human
history,
even
if
it
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
conduct
of
the
defendant,
and
if
that
had
happened
before
the
defendant
came
to
have
the
firearm,
and
i
think
cases
like
that
properly
give
congress
an
understanding--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
exactly
our
argument,
justice
souter,
and
i
think
that
that's--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
yes,
and
i
understand
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
and
i
understand
that
that
may
not
be
the
best
way
to
write
the
statute,
but
if
the
court's
cases--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
justice
scalia,
because
once
phrases
have
acquired
the
status
of
terms
of
art,
and
congress
has
been
told
that
it
can
go
to
the
very
limit
by
using
them,
they--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--you
could
say--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
you
could
say--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
if
that
is
what
one
means,
one
could
say,
the
activities
of
which
considered
in
isolation
affect
interstate
commerce.
i
mean,
all
we're
talking
about
is
how
do
we
determine
congressional
intent,
and
in
a
world
in
which
the
court's
cases
have
told
congress
that
these
words
have
independent
legal
significance,
while
it
may
make
more
sense
in
an
alternative
world
to
sort
of
write
the
statute
differently,
congress
in
effect--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
i
think
that
it
matters
in
the
sense
that
the
activities
of
the
enterprise
of
course
have
to
affect
commerce,
but
one
of
the
tests
that
may
make
that
true
under
this
court's
cases,
and
especially
the
nlrb
cases,
is
that
they
may
affect
commerce
because,
considered
with
other
like
activities
throughout
the
country,
the
effect
on
commerce
is
substantial.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
but
it
isn't,
because
one
of
the
canons
of
this
court's
cases
is
that
congress
is
presumed
to
know
what
this
court's
cases
say
and,
in
effect,
if
you
had
a
case
that
told
congress
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
but
even--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--justice
scalia,
if
you
had
a
case
that
told
congress
that
it
could
reach
to
the
full
limits
of
the
commerce
clause
by
affixing
to
the
statute
the
score
of
"suwannee
river",
and
congress
did
that,
it
should
be
taken
to
have
reached
to
the
limits
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
that's
basically
all
that
we're
arguing
here.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
have
said
it
to
justice
scalia
before,
justice
souter,
and
it
didn't
do
me
much
good
at
the
time,
but
yes,
if
that
were
necessary
to
ascertain
the
meaning
of
congress,
our
view
is
that
the
use
of
the
term
of
art
itself
makes
it
clear.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
there
are
several--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--if
you
use
"affecting"
or
"obstructing",
or
several
of
the
other
words
that
this
court
has
identified--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
it
is,
and
i
see
that
my
time
is
running
low--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
because
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
it
is
possible
to
make
good
arguments,
as
he
did
in
summit
health,
that
the
sherman
act,
because
of
its
different
language,
doesn't
go
so
far,
that
would
not
really
be
there
for
rico,
which
has
much
more
expansive
language.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
we
would...
no.
we
would
look
to
see
whether
the
language
uses...
used
by
congress
reaches
to
the
full
limit
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
if
it
does,
then
that
class-of-activities
analysis
would
be
available
in
every
case.
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--thank
you.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
one
case
in
response
to
the
question
you
asked
earlier.
it
is
not
cited
in
our
brief.
the
name
is
u.s.
v.
ferger,
f-e-r-g-e-r,
250
u.s.
199,
and
the
citation
is
at
page
203,
in
which,
after
stating
the
substance
of
the
affectation
doctrine
the
court
stated,
"it
would
be
superfluous
to
refer
to
the
authorities
which,
from
the
foundation
of
the
government,
have
measured
the
exertion
by
congress
of
its
power
to
regulate
commerce
by
the
principle
just
stated,
since
the
doctrine
is
elementary,
and
is
but
an
expression
of
the
text
of
the
constitution.
"
citing
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
i
have
nothing
further.
