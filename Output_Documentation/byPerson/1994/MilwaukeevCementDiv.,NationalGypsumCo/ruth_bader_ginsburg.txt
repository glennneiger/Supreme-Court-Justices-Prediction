justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
what--
--how
did
this
award
get...
excuse
me.
how
did
this
award
get
to
be
$5
million
of
interest
on
a
$1
million
award?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
challenge
that
as
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
in
the
district
court
you
were
just
arguing
straight
up
interest
or
no
interest,
not
any
question
if
interest,
then
the
rate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
issue
would
still
be
open
to
you
if
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
the
seventh
circuit
were
to
be
affirmed--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
work
out
in
the
jones
act?
for
example,
a
sailor
is
found
to
be
two-thirds
at
fault
and
the
ship
one
third,
would
that
person,
even
though
he
was
two-thirds
at
fault,
get
prejudgment
interest?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
other
comparative
negligence
analogy
in
the
realm
of
admiralty
where
this
question
comes
up,
other
than
collision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
would
it
be
resolved
in
that
context?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
the
cases
in
which
the
presumption
is
operative?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wasn't
that
the
difference
between
admiralty
and
common
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
admiralty
it
was,
you
just
had
the
opposite
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
let's
take,
then,
in
the
admiralty
setting,
justice
souter's
question.
why,
when
you're
just
paying
on
your
percentage
of
the
fault,
and
the
main
rule
in
admiralty
is
interest,
prejudgment
interest,
why
doesn't
the...
why
shouldn't
that
rule
apply?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
they
applied
that,
the
exception
only
if
a
defendant
had
protracted
the
litigation,
some
notion
of
litigation
misconduct,
but
not
in
this
situation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
cases
to
that
effect
outside
when
it
was
the
old
50-50
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
a
case
of
50
percent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stover,
how
does
that
differ
from
the
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit
that
mutual
fault
of
the
parties
in
a
collision
case
does
not
constitute
a
circumstance
justifying
denial
of
prejudgment
interest.
what
more
do
you
want
this
court
to
say,
other
than
that's
right
or
wrong?
