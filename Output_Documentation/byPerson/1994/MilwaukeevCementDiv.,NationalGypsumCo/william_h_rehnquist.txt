chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-788,
the
city
of
milwaukee
v.
cement
division,
national
gypsum
company.
mr.
strauss.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
there's
no
federal
statute
governing
prejudgment
interest,
period,
or
prejudgment
interest
in
admiralty
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
plaintiff
recover
damages
from
any
other
defendant
in
this
case
other
than
the
city
of
milwaukee?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
amount
of
discretion
did
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
in
this
case
leave
to
district
courts
in
the
future
to
deny
prejudgment
interest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
strauss.
mr.
stover.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
wasn't
that
sort
of
a
collision.
this
wasn't
two
vessels.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
always
been
a
discretionary
exception,
hasn't
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
scotland?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
they
do
contain
statements
by
the
authors
of
the
opinion
that
the
award
of
prejudgment
interest
in
admiralty
is
discretionary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
both
the
fifth
and
the
eleventh
circuits
have
a
very
substantial
amount
of
admiralty
business.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
came
from
the
eighth
circuit.
he
used
to
sit
in
st.
louis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
presumably
a
settlement
itself
would
make
the
litigation
itself
and
the
amount
payable
become
due
much
earlier,
so
that
prejudgment
interest
would
be
a
smaller
factor
than
if
you
tried
to
assess
it
after
trial
and
appeal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stover.
mr.
strauss,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
strauss.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
order
number
94-788,
city
of
milwaukee
v.
cement
division,
national
gypsum
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
