mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
go
directly
to
a
couple
of
questions
asked
here,
because
i've
lived
with
this
case
since
that
ship
went
down
and
i
saw
it
the
next
morning,
and
i
know
some
of
the
answers
and
i
don't
think
mr.
strauss
does.
first
of
all,
in
personal
injury
cases
as
well
as
in
all
admiralty
cases,
prejudgment
interest
is
the
rule.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
anderson
v.
whittaker,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
out
of
the
sixth
circuit,
which
disagrees
with
the
fifth
circuit,
holds
that
prejudgment
interest
in
a
personal
injury
case
is
the
rule.
all
admiralty
courts
in
all
circuits,
including
the
fifth
and
the
eleventh,
hold
that
prejudgment
interest
is
to
be
awarded.
now,
whether
you
want
to
talk
about
it
in
terms
of
a
court
has
the
discretion
to
award
it,
or
it
is
the
rule
and
the
court
has
discretion
to
deny
an
award
of
prejudgment
interest,
the
measure
is
still
the
same.
did
the
court
abuse
its
discretion
by
denying
prejudgment
interest?
the
reason
we're
here
is
because
the
ninth,
sixth,
and
seventh
circuits
hold
that
the
exception
to
awarding
prejudgment
interest
is
special
circumstances,
and
all
courts
agree
on
that.
the
ninth,
sixth,
and
seventh
circuits
hold
that
mutual
fault,
or
if
you
want
to
call
it
magnitude
of
fault,
or
if
you
want
to
call
it
genuine
dispute
in
a
mutual
fault
situation,
they
are
not
special
circumstances,
and
they
do
not
justify
by
themselves
a
denial
of
prejudgment
interest.
the
third
and
eighth
circuits
have
not
ruled
on
the
question,
but
have
given
indication
in
cases
that
they
probably
are
going
to
go
along
with
the
sixth,
seventh,
and
ninth
in
that
line
of
reasoning.
district
courts
in
the
first,
second,
third,
fourth,
and
eighth
circuits
have
held
that
mutual
fault
is
not
a
special
circumstance.
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
eleventh
circuit,
which
generally
goes
along
with
it,
have
held
that
it
is
a
special
circumstance,
and
a
judge
may
exercise
his
discretion
to
deny
prejudgment
interest
if
he
wants
to
because
of
mutual
fault,
and
that's
why
we're
here.
there's
a
split
in
the
circuits
on
this,
and
the
majority
rule
is
what
i'm
espousing,
and
the
minority
rule
is
what
mr.
strauss
is
espousing.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
relatively
simple
thing,
although
nothing
is
ever
simple,
i
guess,
in
life,
but
the
underlying
philosophy
for
the
award
of
a
prejudgment
interest
is
that
it
is
a
part
of
damages.
it
is
compensation.
it
serves
to
compensate
for
the
loss
of
the
use
of
money
as
damages
from
the
time
of
the...
when
the
cause
of
action
arose
until
the
time
of
judgment.
in
admiralty,
which
is
a
separate
body
of
law,
and
i
think
this
court
recognizes
that
because
in
miles
v.
apex
marine,
where
the
court
spoke
through
justice
o'connor,
it
very
clearly
talked
about
admiralty
as
a
separate
regime.
it
has
some
statutory
things
that
apply
to
it,
but
by
and
large
it
is
a
judge-made
law,
and
has
been
since
the
beginning
of
this
country.
certainly,
there
are
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
longshore
&
harbor
workers
compensation
act,
the
jones
act,
the
rules
of
the
road
and
those
kind
of
things,
but
by
and
large
the
law
in
admiralty
in
this
country
has
been
case
law.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
well,
justice
souter,
i
can't...
you
have
to
look
at
it
two
ways,
i
would
think.
one
is
in
what
percentages
of
cases
is
fault
ascribed
by
each
party
to
the
other,
and
that
would
probably--
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
--i
would
think
well
over
50
percent
of
collision
cases
involve
mutual
fault.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
they
are
finally
resolved
as--
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
--not
under
my
view.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
i
want
interest
awarded.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
i
would
think
so,
oh
yes,
definitely--
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
--and
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
would
be
doing
even
more,
because
you'd
be
sending
signals
and
doing
all
sorts
of
things
which
i'll
get
to
a
little
later,
but
i...
the
majority
of
collision
cases,
if
we're
going
to
restrict
this
to
collision
cases,
the
majority
of
collision
cases
involve
mutual
fault,
just
as
i
think
almost
a
rule
of
thumb
in
the
insurance
industry,
when
you're
talking
about
intersection
accidents
with
automobiles,
i
think
they
think
that
virtually
all
of
them
have
dual
fault
on
them,
and
they
approach
them
on
a
90-10
basis
even
when
it's
a
rear
end
accident,
but--
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
--no,
this
wasn't.
this
was
a
collision
of
a
vessel
moored
at
a
dock
in
milwaukee
in
the
outer
harbor,
and
a
violent
storm
occurred
and
the
ship
sank
in
the
slip,
an
unusual
circumstance,
a
little
bit
like
looking
at
the
andrea...
the
ile
de
france
burning
at
the
dock
in
new
york.
but
in
admiralty,
prejudgment
interest
has
always
been
awarded.
you
can
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
beginning
of
this
country,
and
in
the
earliest
cases,
and
these
are
cited
in,
i
think,
the
briefs
of
both
parties,
there's
a
case,
del
col
v.
arnold,
way
back
in
3
dallas,
before
they
ever
even
were
doing
anything
but
summarizing
cases.
and
the
anna
maria,
and
the
amiable
nancy,
both
of
which
were
decided
by
chief
justice
marshall,
were
prize
cases,
and
the
rule
developed
from
that
that
in
the
prize
cases,
where
they
were
dealing
with
privateers
who
had
seized
vessels
and
seized
cargo
illegally,
the
rule
was
to
have
them
pay
back
to
the
owner
the
value
of
the
vessel
or
the
value
of
the
cargo
plus
interest
to
the
date
of
judgment,
and
admiralty
has
always
awarded
prejudgment
interest,
except
these
exceptions.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
there
has
been
a
discretionary
exception,
but
other
than
in
the
fifth
and
eleventh
circuits,
where
they
exercise
it
to
include
mutual
fault,
it
has
never
in
any
of
the
other
circuits
included
mutual
fault.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
the
scotland
i
believe
was
the
forerunner...
i'm...
if
that
steam
navigation
company
case,
they
talked
about
prejudgment
interest
in
it
and
said
that
it
was
to
be
awarded,
but
the
scotland
and
another
case
that's
cited
by
the
city,
the
maggie
smith,
involved
limitation
of
liability
and
stipulations
for
value,
or
value
bonds,
which
in
those
days
were
not
required
to
contain
interest
and
didn't,
and
so
they
said,
you
don't
have
to
award
it
in
these...
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
but
no
courts
have
denied
prejudgment
interest
except...
or
not
awarded
it
except
where
their.
--except
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
eleventh
circuit,
except
under...
where
there
are
special
or
peculiar
circumstances,
and
the
special
or
peculiar
circumstances,
except
in
those
two
circuits,
have
always
been
postcasualty
or
postaccident
circumstances
such
as
laches
or
even
less
than
laches,
delay
in
starting
the
lawsuit,
delay
in
prosecuting
a
claim,
exaggerated
or
fraudulent
claims,
postaccident
fraud,
frivolous
claims,
bad
faith
estimate
of
damages,
no
damages
sustained.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
but
one
of
the
basic
reasons
that
that
particular
finding
of
the
trial
court
was
overturned
was
because
96
percent/4
percent
is
the
exact
ratio
of
the
claimed
damages,
$6.5
million
and
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars,
and
that
obviously
is
no
grounds
for
apportioning
fault
under
a
true
comparative
negligence
regime,
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
was
turned
over.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
justice
stevens,
to
my
way
of
thinking,
and
i
think
the
correct
way
of
thinking,
is
that
prejudgment...
is
that
mutual
fault
either
is
a
reason
or
it
is
not
a
reason,
but
there's
no
halfway
between.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
but
that's
the
true
comparative
negligence
regime.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
you
take
into
account
the
equities
between
the
parties,
their
stance,
their
fault,
whatever,
down
to
the
point
of
accident,
when
you
apportioned
your
negligence.
that's
true
comparative
negligence.
prejudgment
interest
shouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
negligence.
it's
an
element
of
damages.
it
has
to
do
with
compensation.
it's
awarded
to
make
the
recovery,
whatever
the
recovery
is,
the
recovery
today,
not
the
recovery
5
years,
10
years
ago,
in
this
case
13
years
before,
because
that
isn't
a
just
recovery.
the
reason
it
isn't
a
just
recovery
is
because
the
party
that's
getting
it
isn't
getting...
isn't
being
put
in
the
place
today
that
it
would
have
been
in
had
the
accident
not
occurred,
whereas
the...
and
that's
the
object,
i
think,
of
tort
liability.
that's
the
object
of
tort
litigation,
is
to
get
the
parties
today
where
they
would--
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
--well,
i
can
only
quote,
justice
o'connor...
not
quote,
but
state
what
the
seventh
circuit
said
in
the
amoco
cadiz
decision,
which
is
that
delay
isn't
a
reason
not
to
award
it.
delay
is
a
reason
to
award
it.
in
this
particular
case,
the
court
questioned
why
the
delay.
the
only
abnormal
parts
of
this
litigation
were
a
1-year
delay
due
to
the
trial
court
changing,
and
there
was
a
pending
motion
on
disqualification
of
counsel,
and
the
court
that
got
it
was
burdened
and
didn't
have
time
to
do
it,
and
took
a
year
to
decide.
the
other
is
that
the
trial
court
took
3
years
and
3
months
to
render
a
decision
following
the
conclusion
of
submission
of
briefs.
i
can't
speak
to
that.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
judge
curran.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
judge
thomas
curran
in
milwaukee.
but
i
would
like
to
speak
to
a
couple
of
things,
because
i
think
it
bears
on
what
the
court
would
be
interested
in
in
this,
and
that
is
what
would
happen...
i
said
before
that
to
my
way
of
thinking
the
underlying
policy...
and
i
think
this
is
to
this
court's
way
of
thinking,
too.
i
think
it
was
espoused
very
clearly
in
the
west
virginia
case.
the
underlying
policy
or
objective
is
not
to
put
the
parties
in
the
same
position
they
would
have
been
in
back
at
the
time
of
casualty,
but
to
put
them
in
the
same
position
today
that
they
would
have
been
in
had
the
casualty
not
occurred,
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
to
award
interest
during
the
intervening
period.
in
a
case
of
mutual
fault
and
mutual
damage
like
this,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
dollars
and
cents
whether
you
assess
the
true
comparative
negligence
and
then
take
the
damages
and
assess
prejudgment
interest
on
the
city's
damages
and
assess
prejudgment
interest
on
the
ship's
damages
and
then
offset
them,
or
whether
you
just
offset
the
damages
and
assess
prejudgment
interest
on
the
difference.
the
dollars
and
cents
comes
out
identically.
but
what
is
important
is
that
prejudgment
interest
achieves
the
objective
of
placing
the
parties
today
where
they
would
have
been
today
had
the
accident
not
occurred.
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
a
rule
awarding
prejudgment
interest
in
mutual
fault
cases,
or
making
it...
well,
awarding
prejudgment
interest
in
mutual
fault
cases,
which
is
what
i
wanted
to
do,
what
would
be
the
result?
it
would
only
change
the
law
in
the
fifth
and
eleventh
circuits,
and
strangely
enough,
the
eleventh
circuit,
i
don't
quite
understand
what
happened
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
but--
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
--yes,
they
do,
your
honor,
but
i
would...
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
would
think
that
if
someone
claimed
that
the
fifth
circuit
overshadowed
the
second
circuit
today
in
the
admiralty
field
that
would
cause
consternation
in
the
ranks.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
they
probably
do.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
they
may
now.
i
don't
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
anyone
in
new
york
would
ever
concede
that
they
overshadow
new
york
in
history
or
in
importance.
but
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
the
rule
that
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
follow,
it
would
only
change
the
law
in
the
fifth
and
eleventh
circuits.
i
started
to
say,
strangely
enough,
judge
nangle
in
a
case,
it's
not
cited
in
anyone's
brief,
but
judge
nangle
of
the
southern
district
of
georgia
in
june,
june
29
of
last
year,
decided
a
case,
a
death
on
the
high
seas
act
case,
and
talked
about
this
very
thing,
and
said,
i
have
already
assessed
the...
taken
into
account
the
fault
of
the
parties
when
i
apportioned
negligence,
and
i
will
not
do
it
again.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
oh,
did
he?
i
don't
think
that
explains...
well,
maybe
it
does
explain
it,
but
he
then
awarded
prejudgment
interest
to
a
plaintiff
who
was...
in
that
case,
this
was
a
personal
injury
case,
wrongful
death,
plaintiff
decedent,
awarded
prejudgment
interest
to
one
who
was
33-1/3
percent
negligent.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
adverse
effects
from
a
rule
that
they
want?
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
i
would
believe
there
would
be
if
the
rule
that
they
want
were
adopted
by
this
court,
which
is
that
the
court
has
discretion
to
deny
prejudgment
interest
or
not
to
award
prejudgment
interest
in
mutual
fault
cases
if
it
wants
to.
it
would
change
the
law
everywhere
except
the
fifth
and
eleventh
circuits.
it
would
increase
uncertainty
in
a
mutual
fault
admiralty
collision
case,
and
there
would
be
no
uniformity.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
that
were
the
rule
adopted,
i
don't
know
what
would
be
the
standard
of
review.
it
would
certainly
be
almost
undiscernible
as
to
when
a
court
would
abuse
its
discretion.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
i
would
think
so,
yes,
but
how
would
you
measure
an
abuse
of
discretion?
i
can't
see
a
way
to
do
it.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
would
preclude
settlements,
or
slow
them
down
because
of
the
uncertainty,
the
lack
of
uniformity--
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
--by
the
same
token,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
leaving
open
the
question
as
to
prejudgment
interest,
leaving
it
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
would
encourage
a
party,
particularly
a
party
which
had
incurred
lesser
damages,
to
gamble,
to
roll
the
dice.
what
have
we
got
to
lose?
if
they
decide
against
us,
we
just
pay
what
we
would
have
to
pay
anyway,
but
in
the
meantime,
we
have
had...
we
gamble
that
we
have
had
this
interest
free,
because
the
judge
in
a
mutual
fault
decision
will
deny
prejudgment
interest,
whereas
if
the
rule
is
to
award
it,
there
is
certainty.
and
in
fact
i
think
that
a
rule
that
would
award
prejudgment
interest
in
mutual
fault
cases
would
encourage
participation
in
such
things
as,
certainly
in
bifurcation,
because
you
know
that
when
you
get
done
with
the
initial
trial
on
liability,
you're
going
to
have
certainty.
it
isn't
going
to
come
back
and
face
you
again
when
it
comes
to
damages.
i
think
it
would
encourage
the
use
of
mini
trials
and
summary
trials
again
because
of
certainty.
you
know
that
when
you
get
a
decision
there
it's
going
to
be
a
reading
on
what
is
going
to
finally
occur.
it
may
not
be
the
exact
reading,
and
half
the
time
it
doesn't
agree
with
what
you
think
it's
going
to
be,
but
it's
a
reading,
an
educated
reading
on
the
case.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
the
seventh
circuit
is
the
only
one
that
has
ever
stepped
in
and
reassessed
a
fault
and
even
said
what
it
is
instead
of
sending
it
back,
and
off-hand
i
can't
cite
you
the
authority,
but
i
remember
going
through
this
at
the
time
of
the
appeal,
and
they
weren't
the
first
who
ever
did
that,
but
they
followed
the
clearly
erroneous
rule,
and
on
the
face
of
it
the
96-4
apportionment,
which
was
in
exact
proportion
to
the
damage
occurred,
claimed
to
be
incurred
by
the
parties,
was
not
exactly
cricket
for
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
well,
there
was--
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
--yes,
justice
scalia.
they
didn't
exactly
come
out
and
say
that,
but--
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
has
before
it
a
true
comparative
negligence
regime,
and
if
you
are
considering
true
comparative
negligence,
then
when
you
compare
the
negligence
and
reach
a
final
conclusion
as
to
it,
it
should
be
final,
and
however
the
outcome
after
that
in
damages
one
party
probably
is
going
to
recover
something
from
the
other.
it
may
be
a
lot,
it
may
be
a
little,
but
they're
going
to
recover
something.
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
as
each
party
recovering
from
the
other,
each
party
being
a
winner
and
a
victim,
and
each
party
recovering
something
from
the
other,
prejudgment
interest
should
be
awarded
on
each
recovery,
and
then
you
offset
them.
what
we
did
here
is
just
bypass
that
and
offset
them
to
begin
with,
and
there
was
a
net
recovery.
but
the
party
entitled
to
the
net
recovery
is
entitled
to
that
recovery
as
if
its
value
today,
not
its
value
in
this
case
13
years
previously.
unfortunately,
litigation
does
take
time
once
in
a
while.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
if
one
party
is
guilty
of
wanton
and
wilful
misconduct
in
your
comparison
of
negligence
you
take
that
into
account.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
well,
if
that's
your
hypothetical,
justice
stevens,
i
would
say
that
it
should
not
be
considered,
but
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
proper
hypothetical,
because
i
can't
imagine
a
trial
court
faced
with
wanton
and
wilful
misconduct
on
the
part
of
one
party
and
ordinary
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
other
party
not
taking
that
into
account
in
apportioning
the
fault.
i
would
think
every
court
would
do
that.
i
would
like
to
say
one
thing.
if
this
court
should
see
fit
to
uphold
the
seventh
circuit
and
to
uphold
the
underlying
policy
and
all,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
within
the
scope
of
the
consideration
and
within
the
scope
of
this
case
if
the
court
could
lay
down
some
parameters
for
the
awarding
of
prejudgment
interest.
i
don't
mean
talking
about
prime
rate,
or
government
bonds,
or
u.s.
treasury
bills,
or
anything
like
that,
because
that
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
but
fixing
some
parameters
so
that
it
is
clear
that
prejudgment
interest
is
to
be
awarded
as
compensation,
as
damages.
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
place
the
party
that's
getting...
that's
recovering
the
money
in
the
position
that
it
would
have
been
today
had
the
accident
not
occurred,
and
the
way
to
do
that
is
to
assess
interest
during
the
intervening
period
at
a
reasonable...
let's
say
to
assess
a
reasonable
or
just
interest
during
the
intervening
point...
period
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
plaintiff
to
make
the
plaintiff
receive...
not
the
plaintiff,
the
recovering
party,
to
make
the
recovering
party
receive
just
compensation.
mr.
harney
b.
stover,
jr.
well,
personally,
if
the
court
will
say
that,
and
says
i'm
right,
the
seventh
circuit
is
right,
i
wouldn't
want
any
more,
but
i
would
just
think
that
as
a
matter
of
policy,
since
this
court
is
considering
prejudgment
interest
in
a
mutual
fault
case
and
this
court
has
a
history
of
developing
a
philosophy
to
award
prejudgment
interest
unless
it's
precluded
by
something
in
admiralty,
by
special
or
peculiar
circumstances,
of
course
where
there's
a
statutory
prohibition
against
it,
where
there's
a
longstanding
legal
principle
against
it,
but
in
other
cases
this
court
has
been
developing
a
history
of
awarding
prejudgment
interest,
so
this
might
be
a
likely
case
to
fix
some
parameters,
not
specific
or
anything,
but
some
general
parameters
for
the
award.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
