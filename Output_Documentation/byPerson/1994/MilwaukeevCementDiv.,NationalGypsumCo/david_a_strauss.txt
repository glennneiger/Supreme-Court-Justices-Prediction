mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
district
court
in
an
admiralty
collision
case
may
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
withhold
prejudgment
interests
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiff
was
the
party
predominantly
at
fault,
and
that
the
defendant,
throughout
much
of
the
litigation,
had
reason
to
believe
it
would
not
be
held
liable
at
all.
the
collision
involved
in
this
case
occurred
on
christmas
eve,
1979,
when
a
storm
blew
up
in
lake
michigan
near
milwaukee.
a
ship
called
the
em
ford,
loaded
with
cement,
broke
away
from
its
mooring,
crashed
into
its
berth,
took
on
water,
and
sunk.
the
respondents
are
the
owners
and
insurers
of
the
ship,
and
they
sued
in
admiralty
for
$6.5
million.
they
claim
that
the
city
was
negligent
in
not
warning
of
the
danger
of
storms.
the
city
denied
negligence
and
said
that
the
accident
had
been
caused
by
the
negligence
of
the
ship's
master
in
leaving
the
ship
essentially
unattended
in
its
berth,
without
any
means
to
monitor
the
weather
or
to
call
for
help.
the
city
also
counterclaimed
for
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
in
damage
to
its
dock.
the
suit
didn't
come
to
trial
until
1986,
at
which
point
the
issue
of
liability
was
tried.
the
district
court
decided
the
liability
issue
in
1989,
and
it
ruled
at
that
point
that
the
respondents
were
almost
entirely
at
fault.
specifically,
the
city
was
liable
for
only
4
percent
of
the
damages.
that
ruling
of
the
district
court,
10
years
after
the
accident,
was
reversed
by
the
seventh
circuit
a
year
later.
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
district
court
had
inadequately
explained
its
apportionment
of
liability.
instead
of
remanding,
however,
the
seventh
circuit
itself
reapportioned
the
liability,
still
assigning
the
bulk
of
the
share
to
respondents,
two-thirds
to
respondents,
one-third
to
the
city.
at
that
point,
the
parties
entered
into
a
settlement
agreement
on
the
liability
issue.
the
city
agreed
to
pay
$1.67
million,
compared
to
the
$6.5
million
initially
sought,
to
the
respondents.
the
parties
further
agreed
in
this
settlement
that
the
district
court
would
determine
whether
prejudgment
interest
was
to
be
awarded,
and
if
so,
in
what
amount.
the
district
court
then
denied
the
respondents'
request
for
$5.3
million
in
prejudgment
interest.
the
district
court
recognized,
and
it
is
common
ground
here,
that
in
admiralty
the
presumption
is
in
favor
of
awarding
prejudgment
interest,
but
the
district
court
denied
prejudgment
interest
in
this
case
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiff
was
far
more
at
fault
than
the
city,
and
that
throughout
most
of
the
litigation,
nearly
all
of
the
litigation,
there
was
a
good
chance
that
the
city
would
not
be
held
liable
in
any
way.
the
seventh
circuit
again
reversed,
holding
that
the
district
court
may
never
exercise
discretion
to
withhold
prejudgment
interest
on
the
grounds
that
the
plaintiff
was
at
fault,
and
this
court
then
granted
certiorari.
now,
there
is
no
general
federal
prejudgment
interest
statute.
instead,
judge-made
rules
govern
prejudgment
interest
in
federal
courts
in
admiralty,
and
in
cases
arising
under
federal
statutes
that
are
silent
on
the
matter
of
prejudgment
interest.
the
one
constant
in
these--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--there
is
no
federal
statute
governing
prejudgment
interest
in
admiralty
cases.
there's
also
no
umbrella
federal
statute,
as
there
is
for
postjudgment
interest.
there
are
prejudgment
interest
provisions
in
certain
specific
federal
programmatic
statutes.
in
the
judge-made
cases
that
govern
admiralty
and
also
the
federal
statutes
that
are
silent
on
prejudgment
interests,
the
one
constant
has
been
that
an
award
of
prejudgment
interest
is
by
no
means
automatic,
as
this
court
said
in
its
most
recent
such
case.
rather,
the
trial
court
has
discretion
in
deciding
whether
to
award
prejudgment
interest.
here,
the
district
court
exercised
its
discretion,
and
withheld
prejudgment
interest
because
two
factors
coalesced.
first,
for
the
first
11
years
of
the
13-year
litigation,
the
city
had
every
reason
to
think
that
it
would
be
subject
to
no
significant
liability.
the
suit
was
initially
brought
by
a
ship
that
had
broken
loose
from
its
mooring.
the
city
did
not
moor
the
ship.
the
claim
was
only
negligent
failure
to
warn.
when
the
district
court
decided
the
liability
issue,
the
district
court
reapportioned
the
liability
on
a
96
to
4
basis,
holding
the
city
only
4
percent
at
fault.
even
after
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
the
plaintiffs
were
still
the
party
predominantly
at
fault
by
a
ratio
of
2
to
1,
and
that
was
the
second
factor
that
influenced
the
district
court's
exercise
of
its
discretion.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
was
11
years
after
the
accident,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
first...
the
decision
was
10
years
after
the
accident.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reverse
it
until
11
years
after
the
accident.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
district
court,
which
was--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that's
quintessentially
the
kind
of
issue
that
the
district
court
is
in
a
position
to
resolve,
and
were
the
district
court
to
say,
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion,
you
should
have
known
all
along
that
you
might
be
held
substantially
liable,
the
district
court
could
exercise
its
discretion
and
award
prejudgment
interest
in
some
amount.
but
the
district
court
here
reached
the
opposite
conclusion,
and
all
we're
contending
for
is
that
the
district
court
should
be
able
to
exercise
its
discretion
in
that
regard.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
accident
occurred
on
christmas
eve,
1979,
justice
kennedy,
and
the
interest
was
accumulating
all
that
time.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
1.677
million.
that's
the
claim,
is
for
$5.3
million.
that's
the
claim
that
the
respondents
are
making.
as
i
said,
the
other
factor
that
influenced
the
district
court
and
that
has
been
prominent
in
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--and
needless
to
say,
justice
kennedy,
we'd
be
delighted
if
it
were
a
lower
amount,
but
that's
the
amount
the
respondents
are
asking
for,
i
assume
calculating
it
at
prime
rate,
which
is
of
course
a
serious
question
whether
that
should
be
the
rate,
when
it's
a
municipal
government
that's
being
asked
for
the
interest,
but
respondents
make
that
calculation.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
we,
in...
the
district
court
denied
all
prejudgment
interest.
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
that
and
remanded
for
a
calculation
of
the...
of
interest.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
also
argued
about
the
rate
in
the
district
court,
justice
ginsburg,
and
it's
our
position
that
prime
rate
is
completely
inappropriate
for
a
municipal
government
that
can,
after
all,
borrow
in
the
market
at
less
than
half
of
prime
rate,
and
that
would
continue
to
be
our
position.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--if
the
seventh
circuit
were
to
be
affirmed,
the
issue
of
rate
would
still
be
open,
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg,
although
the
seventh
circuit
did
seem
to
say
that
prime
rate...
the
choice
should
be
between
prime
rate
and
the
short
term
borrowing
rate
of
the
city,
so
it
made
some
remarks
about
the
rate,
but
the
issue
of
rate
would,
subject
to
those
limits
placed
on
it
by
the
seventh
circuit,
be
open
on
remand,
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
there
again,
justice
scalia,
that
points
to
a
problem
that
i
think
the
district
court
is
in
a
position
to
resolve,
although
i
should
say
that
our
contention
is
the
district...
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
simply
to
announce
the
principle
that
in
a
case
where
the
plaintiff
is
predominantly
at
fault
and
the
defendant
had
a
reason
to
think
it
wasn't
liable,
the
district
court
can
exercise
its
discretion.
the
other
factor,
as
i
said,
that
influenced
the
district
court
was
just,
as
this
court
has
said
in
its
prejudgment
cases,
the
relative
equities
of
the
parties,
a
factor
that
this
court
has
frequently
said
should
play
a
role
in
deciding
the
award
of
prejudgment
interest,
and
the
district
court
was
influenced
by
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
were
not
only
at
fault
but
predominantly
at
fault.
after
all,
in
a
regime
of
contributory
negligence,
which
to
be
sure
admiralty
has
never
had,
in
a
regime
of
contributory
negligence,
a
party
who
is
even
somewhat
at
fault
receives
nothing.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i...
under
the
jones
act,
i
believe,
justice
ginsburg,
prejudgment
interest
is
not
available,
i
believe.
here's
why.
the
jones
act
remedial
provisions
are
aligned
with
those
of
the
fela,
and
this
court
decided
in
monessen
that
there's
no
prejudgment
interest
available
under
the
fela,
so
that
while
i
can't
say
that
it's
a
settled
issue,
i
believe
prejudgment
interest
is
simply
unavailable
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
in
personal
injury
cases
as
well,
other
than
jones
act
cases,
such
as
a
personal
injury
arising
out
of
a
collision,
the
issue
would
come
up.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
context
in
which
it
comes
up.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
that's
the
same
question
as
the
court
is
faced
with
here.
that's
a
question
that's
open.
traditionally,
the
cases
have
said
the
district
court
has
discretion.
the
presumption
is
in
favor,
which
we
don't
contest,
but
the
district
court
has
discretion,
and
the
position
that
we
contend
for
and
that
many
courts
of
appeals
have
endorsed
is
that
when
there's
a
dispute
about
the
existence
of
any
liability,
and
the
plaintiff
is
at
fault,
the
district
court
may...
need
not,
but
may
exercise
its
discretion
to
deny
prejudgment
interest.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
believe
all
admiralty...
all
admiralty
cases,
i
believe,
justice
ginsburg.
all
admiralty
collision
cases.
i
don't
know
if
the
presumption
is
operative
in
general
average
cases,
for
example.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
believe
not.
is
that...
i
believe
not,
your
honor,
but
i'll
have
an
answer
to
that
for
you
on
rebuttal.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
justice
souter,
we're
not
asking
to
be
treated
any
differently
from
any
tortfeasor.
the
common
law
rule
was
that
you
don't
recover
prejudgment
interest
in
torts.
you
recover
it
only
in
contract
cases,
or
in
cases
where
the
damages
were
ascertainable,
which
i
think
meant
liquidated.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
an
independent
rule,
justice
souter,
even
in
cases
not
involving
contributory
negligence.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
at
admiralty
you
had
the
presumption
in
favor,
that's
right.
the
common
law
was
much
more
hostile
to
prejudgment
interest
than
admiralty,
which
was
not
hostile
to
it,
but--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
i
think
the
answer,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
prejudgment
interest
has
had
a
separate
status
in
our
system.
prejudgment
interest
hasn't
been
seen
as
something
that
automatically
went
along
in
order
to
make
the
plaintiff
whole.
this
is--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--justice
souter,
i
mean,
i
think
the...
if
the
sole
objective
of
the
system
were
to
provide
a
plaintiff
with
full
compensation,
there
would
be
no
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
there
are
two
things
really,
justice
souter.
the
first
is
not...
i
don't
know
if
it's
an
objective,
but
it's
the
traditional
treatment
of
prejudgment
interest.
prejudgment
interest--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
what
it
would
mean
in
this
case,
saying
that
prejudgment
interest
must
be
awarded
not
as
a
matter
of
discretion
but
must
be
awarded,
period--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
there
really...
okay,
justice
souter
there
are
two
questions,
and
i
think
i
may
have
been
confused
over
which
you
were
asking.
if
the
question
is,
why
should
there
be
any
discretion
at
all,
then
my
principal
and
only
answer
is
to
say
that...
is
that
to
say
there's
no
discretion
would
be
to
overrule
over
100
years
of
precedent
with
which
congress
has
apparently
been
satisfied.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
if
the
question
is,
given
that
there's
discretion,
why
should
it
be
exercised
in
a
case
like
this,
then
there
really
are
two
points
to
be
made.
the
first
is
that
awarding
prejudgment
interest
puts
pressure
on
a
defendant
to
settle.
there
may
be
cases
in
which,
the
district
court
apparently
thought
this
was
one,
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
put
so
much
pressure
on
a
defendant
to
settle.
when
prejudgment
interest
is
going
to
be
awarded,
defendant,
the
city
in
this
case,
is
in
the
position
of
saying
to
itself,
if
we
don't
settle
on
whatever
terms
the
plaintiff
is
offering,
we
are
in
effect
going
into
the
market
and
borrowing
money
from
them
and
guaranteeing
them
a
return
at
possibly
prime
rate
for
the
duration
of
the
litigation,
13
years.
that's
a
major
decision
for
a
city.
it's
a
nice
thing
for
a
plaintiff
to
have,
a
guaranteed
investment
at
that
rate.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
that's
right,
justice
souter,
and
it's
why
we
don't
contend
for
anything
more
than
a
degree
of
discretion
in
the
district
court
when
it
decides,
as
it
evidently
did
here,
that
the
defendants
have
acted
in
a
reasonable
fashion,
it
can
then
withhold
the
award
of
prejudgment
interest.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
second
reason
is
this
history
of
using
prejudgment
interest
to
respond
to
equity-like
considerations,
the
relative
equities
of
the
parties,
considerations
of
fundamental
fairness,
which
i
think
is
best
interpreted
as
reflecting
the
kinds
of
concerns
that
underlay
both
contributory
negligence
and
different
kinds
of
comparative
fault
rules.
there
are,
after
all,
comparative
fault
regimes
in
which
a
plaintiff
that
is
50-percent
at
fault
doesn't
recover
at
all,
and
the
best
interpretation,
i
think,
of
the
court's
repeated
references
to
fundamental
fairness,
considerations
of
the
equities,
is
to
say
that
a
district
court
can
say,
well
in
this
case
the
plaintiff
was
so
much
more
at
fault
that
we're
going
to
deny
not
its
recovery,
it
gets
its
recovery,
but
we're
going
to
deny
it
prejudgment
interest.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
i
don't--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--no,
not
at
all,
justice
souter.
i
mean,
there
are
many
reasons
to
believe
the
contrary,
one
of
which
is
the
body
of
cases
justice
ginsburg
alluded
to.
in
personal
injury
actions
in
admiralty
the
rule
has
always
been
comparative
fault,
yet
courts
applied
the
principle
there
as
well.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
i
think
this
principle
that...
mutual
fault
with
a
good
faith
dispute
is
the
way
they
put
it,
meaning,
i
think,
that
the
defendant
had
reason
to
think
it
would
not
be
held
liable
at
all,
they've
applied
that
principle
as
well.
that's
a
separate
principle
from
the
plaintiff's
prolonging
its...
prolonging
the
litigation.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
we
have
cases
to
that
effect
involving
personal
injury
which
was
never
subject
to
the
50-50
rule
cited
in
our
brief,
a
case
called
ceja
from
the
fifth
circuit,
another
case
called
pluyer
from
the
fifth
circuit,
which
was
cited
in
our
brief.
but
there
are
other
reasons
for
this
as
well.
this...
i
mean,
if
what
you
were...
when
courts--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
tradition,
justice
scalia...
the
tradition
is
a
tradition
of
discretion
in
the
awarding
of
prejudgment
interest,
of
not
regarding
prejudgment
interest
simply
as
an
element
of
the
plaintiff's
compensation.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
if
the...
justice
scalia,
if
the
sole
objective
were
to
provide
the
plaintiff
with
full
compensation,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
explain
why
prejudgment
interest
at
some
rate
shouldn't
be
awarded.
the
rate
would
be
highly
controversial.
but
prejudgment
interest,
like
attorney's
fees,
is
one
of
the
elements
of
our
system,
or
like
indirect
economic
costs,
or
like
approximate
causation,
these
are
elements
of
our
system
in
which
compensation
of
the
plaintiffs
has
not
been
the
sole
objectives.
plaintiffs
aren't
fully
compensated
when
they
have
to
pay
their
own
fees.
nonetheless,
in
our
system
they
have
to
pay
their
own
fees.
they're
not
fully
compensated
when
they
don't
get
prejudgment
interest,
but
the
tradition
in
our
system
for
over
100
years,
which
congress
not
only
hasn't
changed,
but
when
congress
thought
about
enacting
a
general
federal
law,
it
left
discretion
alone--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
want
to
deny
that
some
courts
of
appeal
used
the
rule
that
way,
but
it's
not
the
case
that
discretion
was
only
exercised
to
mitigate
unfairness.
in
fact,
one
of--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
one
of
the
cases
we
cite
from
this
court,
the
scotland,
justice
bradley's
opinion
from
1884
or
'5,
upheld
a
denial
of
prejudgment
interest,
and
justice
bradley,
explaining
why
he
was
upholding
the
denial,
talked
about
how
reasonable
it
was
for
the
defendant
in
this
case
to
pursue
the
position
it
was
pursuing
in
the
case.
he
didn't--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--it
was
not,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
it
was
a
case
of
undivided
damages.
now,
the
court--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
there
are
no
findings
on
this
point,
justice
o'connor,
but
so
far
as
one
can
infer
from
the
record,
there
were
really,
well,
three
things
going
on.
one
was
there
was
some
collateral
litigation
about
a
plaintiff,
disqualification
of
plaintiff's
counsel.
plaintiff's
original
lead
counsel
was
disqualified
for
a
conflict
of
interest,
and
there
was
a
trip
to
the
court
of
appeals
about
that.
the
second
was
the
case
was
transferred
from
the
docket
of
one
district
judge
to
another,
and
the
third
was
that
the
district
judge
took
3
years
from
the
date
of
the
submission
of
the
case
to
the
date
of
rendering
the
judgment,
so
those
three
factors,
combined
with
the
usual
delays
of
discovery,
so
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
record.
as
i
say,
there
are
no
findings
on
the
question
of--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--yes,
it
would.
it
was
a...
this
is
the
scotland,
the
case
from
this
court?
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
it
would.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
was
i
believe
a
limitation
of
liability
case.
as
i
said
in
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
about
the
one
reason
that
the
district
court...
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave
for
denying
all
discretion
in
these
cases,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
that
discretion
had
been
used
to
offset
the
harsh
effects
of
the
divided
damages
rule.
we
lay
out
many
reasons
in
our
brief,
including
the
one
i
mentioned
to
justice
souter,
the
cases
that
were
cited,
that
we
cited
in
our
brief
that
the
divided
damages
rule
wasn't
in
play
and
nonetheless
this
mutual
fault
approach
to
prejudgment
interest
was
applied,
but
i
suppose
the
best
way
to
explain
the
weakness
of
the
court
of
appeals
reasoning
is
that
this...
denying
prejudgment
interest
is
a
very
crude
way
of
dealing
with
the
supposed
inequities
of
the
divided
damages
rule.
when
lower
courts
wanted
to
deal
with
those...
with
the
perceived
harshness
of
that
rule,
what
they
did
was
to
design
rules
to
deal
with
it,
the
so-called
major-minor
fault
rule,
that
when
a
party
was
only
somewhat
at
fault
they
would
not
divide
damages,
and
the
so-called
in
extremis
rule,
which
operated
to
somewhat
the
same
effect.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
none
on
the
grounds
of
the
plaintiff
being
predominantly
at
fault,
or
the
defendant
having
a
reasonable
litigation
position
throughout
the
litigation.
none
on
that
ground.
the...
i
believe
they
left
open
the
possibility
that
prejudgment
interest
could
be
denied
if
the
plaintiff
delayed
in
litigating,
although,
of
course,
justice
scalia's
line
of
questions
could
be
asked
about
that,
too,
even
if
the
plaintiff's
delaying,
the
defendant
still
has
the
money,
the
plaintiff
still
doesn't
have
the
money,
why
not
award
the
interest.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
two
clarifications,
and
then
just
one
point.
i'm
told
that
one
party
to
the
case
did
settle
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial,
but
no
effort
was
made
to
integrate
that
settlement
with
the
settlement
with
the
city.
secondly,
justice
scalia,
the
passage
in
the
scotland
i
was
thinking
of
is
at
118
u.s.
519,
at
519,
the
beginning
of
that
page,
and
let
me
be
clear
about
what
my
submission
is.
the
scotland
is
not
a
mutual
fault
case,
so
the
claim
cannot
be
made
that
the
prejudgment
interest
is
being
used
to
adjust
the...
to
compensate
for
the
divided
damages
rule.
what
justice
bradley
did
there,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
take
into
account
the
reasonableness
of
the
defendant's
posture
in
the
litigation,
and
say
that
justified
the
exercise
of
discretion
to
deny
prejudgment
interest.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
issue
was
limitation
of
liability,
and
the
defendants...
what
justice
bradley
is
saying,
i
think,
is
that
the
defendant
tried
to
pursue
this
in
good
faith.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
there
is
a
certain
coherence
to
the
idea
that
we
should
have
a
nondiscretionary
regime
in
which
prejudgment
interest
is
simply
awarded
as
a
matter
of
course
no
matter
what,
in
order
to
make
the
plaintiff
whole
and
take
away
any
windfall
from
the
defendant.
there's
a
certain
coherence
to
that
regime.
of
course,
that
regime
would
require
upsetting
literally
a
century
of
precedent.
if
we
are
not
going
to
have
that
regime,
if
we
are
going
to
have
a
discretionary
regime,
then
our
submission
is
that
a
case
in
which
one
party
pursued
the
litigation
in
a
reasonable
fashion,
or
at
least
so
the
district
court
apparently
thought,
and
that
party
was
much
less
at
fault
than
the
other,
is
an
appropriate
one
in
which
to
exercise
discretion.
we're
not
saying
that
in
all
such
cases
prejudgment
interest
must
be
denied.
we're
not
saying
that
remotely.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
in
those
cases
where
the
defendant
is
much
less
at
fault
than
the
plaintiff,
and
the
defendant
had
reason
to
think
it
would
not
be
liable
at
all,
the
district
court,
if
there
is
to
be
discretion...
if
there
is
to
be
discretion...
that
is
an
appropriate
case
in
which
the
district
court
should
be
allowed
discretion.
thank
you
very
much.
