justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
strauss,
i
guess
i'm
just
missing
the
basic
logic
of
the
position.
if
we
reject
the
contributory
negligence
concept
in
which
the...
you
know,
the
tortfeasor
is
not
going
to
get
a
nickel,
so
that
we
do
not
have
a
per
se
rule
that
those
who
commit
torts
or
are
in
some
way
responsible
for
their
own
damages
get
nothing,
and
in
fact
we
do,
as
here,
have
a
rule
in
which
the
only
thing
you
are
paying
for
is
the
share
with
respect
to
which
you
are
at
fault,
why
should
you
be
treated
any
differently
from
any
other
tortfeasor
who
is
at
fault,
whether
in
fact
there
was
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
other
party
or
not?
why
shouldn't
you
pay
for
the
time
value
of
the
damage
that
you
caused?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that...
now,
you
correct
me.
i
assume
that
did
not
survive
the
rejection
of
the
old
contributory
negligence
concept,
did
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
maybe
the
point
of
the
question
is,
why
should
it?
in
other
words,
there...
i
suppose
we're
simply
invoking
a
concept
of
equity
or
fairness.
if
you
are
not
being
forced
to
pay
for
anything
more
than
your
own
negligence,
why
shouldn't
you
pay
the
time
value
of
the...
for
the
period
of
recovery?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
what's
the
countervailing
objective
that
justifies
a
different
result?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's
just...
if
i'm
selling
you
short,
don't
let
me
do
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying,
well,
we
just
haven't
done
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
not
to
be
awarded
without
a
good
reason,
and
i'm
saying
what
are
the
good
reasons,
and
your
first
answer
is,
well,
it's
been
treated
differently,
which
is
i
think
the
equivalent
of
saying
we
just
haven't.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
a
major
decision
for
any
party
in
litigation
in
which
there
may
be
discretion
exercised
to
award
such
interest.
i
mean,
the
little
angel
on
the
other
shoulder
of
the
city
can
say,
if
we
don't
settle,
and
it
takes
a
long
time
to
pay...
to
litigate,
then
it's
going
to...
and
we
lose
to
some
degree,
then
they
are
going
to
be
a
long
time
without
the
value
which
we
ultimately
will
be
adjudicated
to
have
taken
from
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
what's
the...
you
had
a
second
reason.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
historically
the
reason
was
the
divided
damages
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
it...
interest...
to
the
extent
the
divided
damages
rule
produced
an
inequity,
an
economic
inequity,
prejudgment
interest
can
distort
that
even
further,
but
you
don't
think
that's
the
reason
for
the
solicitude
over
the
years?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
strauss,
may
i
just
go
back
and
ask
you
another
question
about
the
case
that
you
referred
to
in
answering
justice
ginsburg?
you
said
that
was
a
case
of
undivided
damages.
would
it
have
been
a
divided
damages
case
if
there
had
been
fault
on
the
other
side?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
stover,
if
you're
not
accepting
that,
and
assuming
that
we've
got
some
policy
choices
to
make,
can
you
tell
us
what
percentage
of
cases
as
a
general
rule
in
admiralty
involve
mutual
fault,
so
that
if
we
were
to
rule,
for
example,
that
mutual
fault
was
a
reason
to
deny
them,
what
percentage
of
cases
would
we
be
excluding
from
the
general
rule
if
we
did
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
about
the
cases
in
which
fault
is
ascribed
to
each
party
by
the
ultimate
fact-finder?
justice
david
h.
souter
in...
that
is,
they
are
finally
resolved.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
we
would
be
excluding,
on
your
view,
more
than
half
the
cases
from
the
operation
of
the
rule,
of
the
interest
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
no--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
we
went
mr.
strauss'
way,
we
would
be
excluding
more
than
half
the
cases
from
the
possibility
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
