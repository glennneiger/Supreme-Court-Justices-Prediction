mr.
stover,
what
about...
this
one
case
keeps
running
through
my
mind.
i
don't
know
whether
it
makes
a
difference
or
not
as
to
whether
it's
a
special
or
unusual
circumstance
as
you
use
the
term,
had
the
ultimate
outcome
been
the
same
as
at
the
end
of
the
first
trial,
96
percent
fault
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff
and
4
percent
fault
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
but
this
tremendous
disparity,
tremendous
amount
of
damage
makes
this
4
percent...
could
make
even
the
4
percent
a
very
significant
item.
would
even
a
96,
97
percent
fault
be
a...
possibly
be
an
unusual
circumstance
that
would
justify
denial
of
prejudgment
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
conceivably
there
could
be
a
valid
reason
for
that
kind
of
an
apportionment,
and
instead
of
it
coming
out
even,
it
might
have
been
the
city's
damages
were
just
half
of
that
amount,
and
then
you'd
have
a
lot
of
money
involved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
logically
what
you
say
makes
a
lot
of
sense,
but
somehow
or
other
it
seems
sort
of
strange
to
me
to
say
somebody's
96
percent...
assuming
such
a
case,
96
or
99
percent
fault,
and
they
end
up
collecting
a
huge
sum
of
money
and
getting
prejudgment
interest.
somehow
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
sense.
logically
it,
does,
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
was
the
judge,
just
out
of
curiosity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
sophisticated
application
of
the
old
divided
damage
rule.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be,
in
your
view,
a
permissible
special
circumstance
if
the
trial...
finder
of
fact
thought
that
the
prevailing
party
for
its
share
of
the
responsibility
was
guilty
of
wilful
and
wanton
misconduct
that
in
other
contexts
were
adjusted
by
punitive
damages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
though
what
they
did
only
contributed...
was
only
the
causal
factor
for
half
of
the
damages?
i
mean,
the
malicious
or
wilful
character
of
the
conduct
might
not
affect
the
division
between
whether
it's
75-25,
or
35-65,
but
it
would
just
be
a
factor
that
would
normally
justify
punitive
damages.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
arises
out
of
american
disaster
that
occurred
on
christmas
eve
in
1979,
when
a
cargo
ship
sunk
in
milwaukee
harbor
during
a
very
severe
winter
storm.
the
ship
was
worth
about
five
million
dollars
and
internally
caused
some
damage
to
the
wharf
and
the
city
and
the
owner
of
the
ship
got
involved
in
litigation
each
accusing
the
other
of
negligence.
as
result
of
a
long
trial
and
appeals
and
one
thing
and
other,
it
was
finally
determined
that
the
ship
owner
was
primarily
responsible
for
the
loss.
two-thirds
of
the
responsibility
requested
on
the
ship
owner
and
one-third
on
the
city,
which
meant
that
when
they
figured
out
all
the
pluses
and
minuses,
there
was
a
net
liability
of
about
million-and-a-half
dollars
that
the
city
owed
to
the
ship
owner.
the
question
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
or
not
pre
judgment
interest
shall
be
paid
on
net
amount
for
the
period
of
time
since
the
accident
occurred.
the
general
rule
in
that
time
collision
cases
prejudgement
interest
is
awarded,
but
there
are
exceptions
for
peculiar
circumstances
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
either
of
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
which
make
the
major
recover
was
primarily
responsible
for
the
loss
or
the
fact
that
there
was
the
genuine
dispute
about
liability
constitutes
a
kind
of
exceptional
circumstance
that
will
justify
a
denial
of
prejudgement
interest.
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
held
that
no
such
interest
should
be
awarded.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
we
agree
with
the
views
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
prejudgment
interest
is
appropriate.
opinion
is
unanimous
except
for
the
fact
that
justice
breyer
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
the
case.
