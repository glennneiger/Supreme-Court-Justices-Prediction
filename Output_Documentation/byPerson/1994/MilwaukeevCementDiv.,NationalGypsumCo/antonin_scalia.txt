justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course,
that
line...
how
far
along
in
that
11-year
period
did
the
96-4
percent
judgment
come?
i
mean,
that's
not
the
whole
11
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
first
decision
was
11
years--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
at
most
10
years.
at
most,
1
year
they
thought
they
were
not
very
much
responsible.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
leap
to
the
conclusion
from
the
fact
that
the
district
court
gave
a
96-4
break
that
all
during
the
period
up
until
then
the
city
thought
it
would
have
negligible
liability.
i
don't
know
why
that
follows.
certainly
it's
reasonable
to
say
that
from
the
time
of
the
district
court
decision
until
the
time
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
the
city
thought,
what
the
heck,
i'm
not...
the
interest
won't
amount
to
anything.
it's
only
for
that
1
year.
that's
not
such
a
big
deal.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
guess
i
don't
know
why
the
amount
should
depend
on
what
the
city
could
borrow
for
as
opposed
to
what
the
person
to
whom
the
city
should
have
paid
the
money
sooner
would
have
been
able
to
get
for
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
a
very
long
tradition
that
you're
referring
to.
i
mean,
two
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i...
but
what's
important
to
me
is
why
should
the
discretion
be
exercised
in
this
case?
you
assert
that
the
prejudgment
interest
is
sort
of
a
penalty
upon
the
losing
party
for
not
settling
sooner.
i
don't
know
why
one
has
to
look
at
it
that
way.
one
can
look
at
it
as
simply
natural
justice.
the
person
who's
been
injured
has
been
deprived
of
the
value
of
what
was
taken
from
the
time
it
was
taken,
not
from
the
time
the
judgment
occurred.
why
isn't
that
an
equally
valid
way
to
look
at
it,
and
if
you
look
at
it
that
way,
i
see
no
reason
to
reduce
the
amount
simply
because
the
city
had
no
reason
to
think
it
was
going
to
lose.
the
fact
is,
the
city
was
at
fault
to
a
certain
amount,
and
it
should
pay
up
and
do
justice.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
substantial
series
of
cases
that
you
show
where
this
discretion
was
exercised
are
cases
where
it
was
exercised
in
order
to
again
move
in
the
direction
of
greater
fairness,
not
taking
account
of
the
fact
that
the
city
couldn't
settle.
certainly,
the
majority
of
cases
where
it
was
exercised,
it
was
exercised
to
mitigate
the
old
rule
that
no
matter
how
minimally
negligent
you
were,
you
ended
up
paying
50
percent.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
else
was
it
used
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
hard
to
figure
out
what
to
settle
for,
if
you
didn't...
a
lot
would
depend
on
whether
the
district
judge
chose
to
give
prejudgment
interest
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
wondering
how
they
got
that
percentage.
that's
how
it
was,
just
the
basis
of
how
much
each
one
had
incurred.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
in
other
words,
a
pox
on
both
of
you,
go
bear
your
own
loss,
essentially.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
as
i
read
what
he
says,
the
posture
was
that
the
defendant
tried
to
put
up
the
money
into
the
court,
and
the
court
wouldn't
have
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
proffer
the
money
and
the
court
wouldn't
allow
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
can
see
a
possible
reason
for...
and
the
plaintiff
refused
it.
