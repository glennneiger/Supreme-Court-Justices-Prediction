but
it
doesn't
work
very
well
when
there
is
such
a
long
delay
in
getting
the
issue
resolved.
i'm
not
sure
which
party
ought
to
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
fact
that
the
court
didn't
get
around
to
it
for
10
years.
justice
sandra

o'connor
well,
they
do
in
numbers
of
cases
decided--

sandra

told.
