what
was
the
base
sum
on
which
the
interest
was
accumulating?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
still
somewhat
astounded
that
it
can
be
almost
two-and-a-half
times
the
amount
of
the
principal.
justice
anthony

other
than
saying
that
the
law
of
the
two
circuits
would
be
displaced,
as
opposed
to
a
substantial
number
of
others,
would
there
be
any
other
adverse
effects
from
the
rule
that
the
petitioner--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
espousing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
the
district
court
under
the
proposed
rule
would
have,
of
course,
more
discretion
than
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
same
subject.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
rule
does...
that
the
city
advocates
does
give
the
district
court
some
insulation
against
the
shock
produced
by
the
court
of
appeals
reallocating
the
fault
that
he
assessed.
