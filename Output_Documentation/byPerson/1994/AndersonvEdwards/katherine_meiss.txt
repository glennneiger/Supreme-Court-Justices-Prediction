ms.
katherine
meiss
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
argues
that
its
consolidation
rule
is
a
valid
way
to
save
money.
we
do
not
dispute
that
states
may,
in
their
afdc's
plans,
take
into
account
economies
of
scale
in
an
effort
to
save
money.
however,
california
has
quite
simply
chosen
the
wrong
method.
although
states
do
have
discretion
in
setting
up
afdc,
that
discretion
is
limited
by
congressional
action,
the
regulations
of
hhs,
and
the
decisions
of
this
court.
one
such
limit
is
that
in
counting
income
and
resources,
the
states
may
only
count
income
and
resources
that
are
actually
available,
in
determining
the
grant
and
payment
amount,
and
to
which
an
individual
has
a
legal
entitlement.
for
the
most
part,
the
state
follows
this
principle
in
formulating
assistance
units.
let
me
explain
a
little
bit
about
how
the
system
works.
if
i
were
to
take
in
my
orphan
nephew,
the
state
would
pay
to
me
a
full
grant
of
299
a
month,
and
it
does
that
despite
the
fact
that
i
have
income
of
my
own
ineligible
for
afdc.
the
state
does
that
because
one
of
the
goals
of
the
statute
is
to
encourage
the
care
of
children
in
the
homes
of
their
relatives,
and
also
because
i
have
no
legal
obligation
to
support
that
child.
similarly,
as
the
state
admits,
if
two
adult
sisters
live
together,
both
of
whom
were
poor,
both
of
whom
had
children
and
required
afdc,
the
state
again
would
pay
two
full
grants
and
would
set
up
two
separate
assistance
units,
and
similarly,
they
do
this
because
there
is
no
legal
duty
to
support.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
poorest
people
and
the
neediest
people,
the
state
stops
following
this
general
rule
and
forces
consolidation
and
doesn't
pay
a
full
grant.
sweeping
the
whole
family
into
the
assistance
unit
is
important,
as
counsel
has
noted,
because
once
in,
all
of
the
income
and
resources
count.
ms.
katherine
meiss
the
consolidated--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--assistance
unit
rule?
ms.
katherine
meiss
no.
the
rule
applies
whether
the
caretaker
in...
california's
rule
applies
whether
the
caretaker
is
applying
or
not,
so
in
my
example
of
the
two
sisters,
to
go
back
to
that
example,
and
the...
let's
say
the
second
sister
died,
the
caretaker
relative
would
be
the
first
sister
on
afdc.
she
would
be
on
afdc
with
her
child,
and
the
second
unit,
which
they
would
try
to
consolidate
together,
would
be
the
orphan
nephew.
ms.
katherine
meiss
so
what's
wrong
is
that
when
they
take
that
step,
when
california
does
that,
what
it
does
is,
it
actually
looks
at
the
situation
and
says,
we
have
two
assistance
units.
it
doesn't
start
out
by
saying
there's
one
assistance
unit.
it
says,
we
have
two,
an
assistance
unit
of
the
caretaker
relative
and
the
child,
and
her
child,
and
an
assistance
unit
made
up
of
the
orphan
nephew,
and
then
it
combines
those
assistance
units,
but
since
it
starts
with
two
assistance
units,
it's
clear
what
it's
doing
is
presuming
that
there's
income
that's
being
shared
between
those
assistance
units,
and
when
it
does
that,
it
violates
the
plain
language
of
the
availability
regulations
at
issue
in
this
case.
ms.
katherine
meiss
uh-huh.
ms.
katherine
meiss
that's
incorrect.
ms.
katherine
meiss
but
in
fact
that's
not
what
is
happening
here,
and
the
solicitor
general's
assertion
that
with
lump
sum
income
they
would
allow
people
to
simply
opt
out
is
not
found
in
any
regulation
or
policy
and
is
clearly
contrary
to
california's
practice.
ms.
katherine
meiss
as
i
understand
your
interpretation,
you're
suggesting
that
the
state
would
only
attribute
the
caretaker's
income
to
her
children,
but
it
doesn't
just
do
that.
it
also
attributes
her
income
to
the
nephews--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--and
the
other...
the
nonsiblings,
the
cousin,
and
what's
wrong
with
that
is
that
in
doing
so
they
violate
the
plain
language
of
the
three
federal
availability
regulations
at
issue
in
this
case.
those
regulations
prohibit
the
state
from
reducing
or
otherwise
prorating
the
grant
to
the
family
based
on
the
presence
in
the
home
of
some
other--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--nonresponsible
individual.
ms.
katherine
meiss
if
you
look
at
the
plain
language
of
the
regulations,
they're
clear.
the
language
says,
you
can't
reduce
or
otherwise
prorate
based
on
the
presence
of
somebody
in
the
household.
it
says
you
can't--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--but
that's
exactly
what
they're
doing
in
this
case.
they're--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--mm-hmm.
ms.
katherine
meiss
but
that
is
the
reason
they're
doing
it,
justice...
they
are
attributing
the
income
because
these
individuals
live
together
in
the
same
household.
for
instance--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--no,
they're...
they
start
out...
this
is--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--they're
argument
is...
they
start
out,
though,
with
two
units,
and
then
they
combine
those
two
units,
and
it's
when
they
take
that
step
of
combining
those
two
units
that
they're
violating
the
availability
principle.
the
availability
principles
applies
when
those
first
units
were
set
up,
but--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--well,
we're
saying
her
interpretation
ignores
the
language
of
the
regulations
which
forbid
proration
or
reduction,
forbid
assuming
a
contribution
of
support,
and
say
that
you
can't
count
as
available
income
when
somebody
doesn't
have
the
legal
ability
to
make
it
available.
that's
the
plain
language
of
the
regulations.
but
the
drafters
of
the
regulations
went
beyond
that
and
said
that
in
addition,
we
mean
what
we
say,
and
they
said
that
you
can't
force
a
contribution
of
support,
and
that's
precisely
what
the
agency
does
in
this
case,
and
what
california
does.
ms.
katherine
meiss
under
the
case
thomas
jefferson
university
and
other
precedents
of
this
court,
if
an
agency's
interpretation
is
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
the
regulations
and
is
inconsistent
with
the
contemporaneous
interpretation
that
the
drafters
gave
to
those
regulations,
then
no
deference
should
be
owed
to
them.
secondly--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--what
they're
now
saying
is
that
they
can
force
a
contribution
of
support,
and
that
they
can
join
these
two
assistance
units,
and
if
you
look
at
42
federal
register,
which
we
cite
on
page
22
of
our
brief,
it's
very
clear
that
the
secretary
at
that
time
said
there
was
no
basis,
no
legal
basis
for
forcing
a
contribution
of
support,
but
that's
precisely
what
they're
doing
in
this
case
is,
they're
forcing
that
contribution.
ms.
katherine
meiss
the
secretary
has
said
that
states
may
do
this.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
however,
this
current
interpretation
is
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
the
regulations,
and
the
contemporaneous
construction
put
on
those
regulations
by
the
drafters.
in
addition,
the...
if
you
look
at
the
second
regulation,
233.90,
which
is
the
substitute
parent
regulation,
it
says
that
in
establishing
financial
eligibility
and
grant
determinations,
in
determining
the
amount
of
the
assistant
payment,
the
income
only
of
the
parent
may
be
considered
available,
and
that
is
a
very
clear
statement.
what
the
state
does
here
is,
we're
not
only
going
to
sweep
in
the
parent's
income,
but
we're
going
to
sweep
in
the
income
of
the
nephew,
and
that's
clearly
forbidden
under
this.
and
furthermore,
no
deference
is
owed,
because
what
the
agency
has
basically
done
is
rewrite
this
regulation.
it's
amending
or
changing
this
regulation.
it's
not
really--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--we're
saying
that...
that's
correct.
in
essence,
that's
correct.
we're
saying
the--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--language
of
the
regulations
is
clear.
ms.
katherine
meiss
that's
correct,
your
honor,
we
are
doing
that.
we're
saying
that
the
language
is
clear
that
this
kind
of
imputation
of
income...
it's
the
automatic
assumption
that's
forbidden
in
this
case,
and
that
in
addition
to
the
language,
the
contemporaneous
construction
put
on
those
words
by
the
drafters
of
this
also
suggest
that
this...
that
the
hhs's
position
is
incorrect.
but
in
addition,
we're
also
arguing
that
the
regula...
that
what
they've
done
in
adopting
the
action
transmittal
is
they've
adopted
a
statement
that
they
should
have...
it's
basically
an
amendment
to
the
regulation,
it
changes
the
three
availability
regulations,
and
that
should
have
been
done
pursuant
to
the
administrative
procedures
act,
and
for
both
of
those
reasons,
this
is
not
a
deference,
and
we
feel
the
court
is
in
a...
is
basically...
the
issue
for
the
court
is,
do
these
regulations
forbid
this
practice,
that's
correct.
ms.
katherine
meiss
yes,
that's
correct,
but
in
this
case...
in
this
case,
the
plain
language
of
the
regulations
is...
we
believe
is
very
clear.
it
says,
you
can't
do
this
kind
of
automatic
assumption.
we
wouldn't
have
an
argument
with
the
state
if
the
state
were
to
say,
are
you
willing
to
contribute
your
money?
the
state
doesn't
do
that.
the
state
says,
simply
because
you
all
live
together,
we're
going
to
throw
you
all
into
this
one
assistance
unit,
and
essentially
what
the
state
is
doing
is
undermining
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
well.
in
king
v.
smith
and
in
lewis
v.
martin
the
court
said...
in
lewis
v.
martin
in
particular,
the
court
said
that
a
step-parent
could...
income
could
not
be
used,
if
they
didn't
owe
a
legal
duty
of
support,
to
decrease
the
grant
to
a
needy
child,
and
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
is
through
the
back
door
do
the
same
thing
by
saying,
we'll
sweep
this...
they
could,
under
their
rationale,
sweep
the
step-parent
in,
and
that
clearly
would
undermine
the
decision
of
this
court.
and
the
state
wants
to
save
money,
but
congress
has
said
when
states
want
to
save
money
in
shared
housing
situations
such
as
this,
there
is
a
way
to
do
it.
ms.
katherine
meiss
well,
the
state
says
that
the
reason
they
do
it,
your
honor,
is
to
save
money.
ms.
katherine
meiss
not
necessarily.
i
mean,
the--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--that's
correct.
ms.
katherine
meiss
but
the
state
admits
its
purpose
here
is
to
save
money,
and
that
they
feel
they're
allowed
to
do
that
because
of
the
economies
of
scale
that
exist
in
shared
living
situations.
and
congress
has
said,
when
states
want
to
take
into
those
kinds
of,
those
economies
of
scale
in
a
shared
living
situation
where
you
have
more
than
one
assistance
unit...
which
is
the
case
here,
as
the
state
admits
it
starts
with
two
units...
the
way
to
do
that
is
pursuant
to
a
valid
proration
plan
under
42
u.s.c.
612,
and
in
that
plan,
congress
set
out
a
way
for
states
to
achieve
these
same
savings,
or
similar
savings,
to
the
one
they
achieve
through
the
consolidated
assistance
unit
rule.
but
what
the
state
is
doing
here
is
essentially
an
end
run
around
the
proration
mechanism,
the
proration
statute,
and
trying
to
do
an
end
run
around
the
three
availability
regulations
at
issue
in
this
case.
ms.
katherine
meiss
well,
we
also
base
our
case,
your
honor,
on
the
court's
interpretation
of
the
language
of
what
income
and
resources
can
be
attributed
to
an
individual
under
602(a)(7)(a),
which
is
the
basis
on
which
the
state
says
it
gets
its
discretion
to
define
assistance
units,
so
we
also
have
that
statutory
claim,
and
we
also
make...
as
interpreted
by
this
court
and
the
regulations
basically
flesh
out
or
make
concrete
the
availability
principle
and
how
it's
used
in
this.
and
we
also
say,
we
also
claim
that
the
policy
or
the
rule,
rather,
violates
the
intent
of
the
afdc
statute,
which
is
to
encourage
the
care
of
children
in
the
homes
of
their
needy
relatives,
which
is
to
provide
for
maximum
self-support,
and
to
strengthen
family
life,
and
that
california's
rule
has
the
exact
opposite
effect.
that
is,
it
destabilizes
the
lives
of
the
families
the
program
is
designed
to
assist,
it
decreases
the
amount
of
money
available
to
these
families,
and
it
creates
such
a
disincentive,
as
you
can
see
from
the
facts
of
one
of
our
plaintiffs,
and
will
for
many
families,
that
they
will
be
forced
to
give
up
these
needy
orphaned
and
abandoned
nephews
and
nieces
and
place
them
in
a
foster
care
system,
and
house
them
away
from
their
home.
ms.
katherine
meiss
well,
in
one
sense
it's
a
false
issue,
because
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
just
the
number
of
individuals
in
the
home,
but
the
legal
responsibility
that
those
individuals
owe
to
one
another.
the
state
admits,
for
instance,
that
it
will
pay
two
caretaker
relatives...
in
the
example
that
i
used
in
the
beginning,
two
sisters
who
are
living
together
on
afdc,
it
will
be
pay
them
two
full
grants,
so
if
you
had
a
situation
where
you
had
one
caretaker,
a
sister
with
two
children
and
another
sister
with
one
children,
and
you
had
a
unit
of
five,
they
would
pay
a
higher
amount
to
that
group
of
people.
so
it's
not
the
number
of
people
that's
important,
but
it's
their
legal
responsibility
to
one
another,
and
the
state
is
basically
saying
that
they
want
to
get
at
the
fact
that
there
are
only
five
people
here,
and
five
people...
with
five
people
there's
an
economies
of
scale,
and--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--no.
their...
if
you
take
their
position
to
its
logical
conclusion,
they
could
sweep
anybody
into
the
unit,
justice
scalia,
but
they...
in
their
regulations,
and
their
rule
is
that
they
don't
do
that,
and
they
don't
do
that
because
there's
no
legal
responsibility
owed
between
the
two
sisters
in
those...
in
that
situation,
and
there's
no
legal
obligation
between
the
cousins.
there's--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--that's
correct.
the
congress
has
decided
that
in
certain
instances
we
will
presume
that
there's...
we're
going
to
allow
this
kind
of
automatic
assumption
that
income
is
available,
and
one
of
those
is
the
mandatory
filing
unit
rule,
which
says
that
nuclear
families
can
be
forced
to
share
their
income
and
resources,
but
this
is
not
a
nuclear
family
we're
dealing
with,
and
so
it's
distinguishable.
there's
one
thing
that
i
would
like
to
correct
that's
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioners,
and
that
is
a
footnote
on
page
15...
on
page
15,
footnote
5,
which
suggests
that
the
harmful
effect
or
the
invidious
effect
of
this
regulation
is
muted
somewhat
by
the
fact
that,
as
they
say,
there's
a
new
action
transmittal
which
would
allow
the
extended
family
members
in
this
case
to
get
foster
care,
and
i
just
want
to
clarify
that
that's
incorrect.
what
that
action
transmittal
merely
said
was
that
when
a
parent
is
taking
care
of
foster
children,
that
that
parent
is
themselves
eligible
for
regular
afdc
for
their
own
needs,
and
that's
a
change
from
prior
law,
but
it
doesn't...
it
has
no
effect
on
this
case,
because
by
definition
the
children
in
this
case
are
not
eligible
for
foster
care.
if
these
children
were,
they
would
have
applied
for
it,
because
they
would
get
so
much
more
money
from
foster
care,
but
by
definition
these
children
don't
meet
the
complicated
linkage
requirements
for
foster
care,
and
therefore
the...
and
i
want
to
point
that
out
because
the
effect
of
the
policy
is
to
create
such
economic
insecurity
in
families
that
those
individuals,
as
happened
in
the
moore
family
here,
are
forced
to
give
those
children
up
to
foster
care.
ms.
katherine
meiss
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
children
that
we're
dealing
with
are
children
who
are
taken
in
by
these
relatives,
are
by
definition
abandoned
or
orphaned,
they're
victims
of
abuse
or
neglect,
and
so
most
of
them
come
to
the
households
with
greater
needs,
with
far
greater
needs,
emotional
needs,
and
many
of
them
are
simply
dropped
off,
as
happened
in
one
of
our
plaintiffs'
case,
merely
with
the
clothes
on
their
back
and
nothing
else.
and
so
there
is
a
difference
between
a
regular
nuclear
family,
i
think,
and
this
kind
of
a
family,
and
that
is,
in
a
nuclear
family
one
generally
plans
the
family.
they
know
when
they're
going
to
have
children.
they
will
hang
onto
the
crib,
if
they're
still
having
youngsters.
but
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
the
individual
is...
you
didn't
plan
for
this.
somebody's
died--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--no.
ms.
katherine
meiss
no,
because--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--because
by
definition
the
children
in
this
situation
do
not
meet
the
foster
care
definition.
ms.
katherine
meiss
because
the
foster
care
program
requires
that
children
be
removed
from
a
home
at
a
certain
point
in
time,
that
they
be...
that
they
go
through
the
court
system
in
order
to
have
foster
care
placed,
and
these
children
aren't.
these
are
children
who
simply
came
into
the
home
of
a
relative
because
somebody
died.
they
voluntarily
claimed
their...
basically
that's--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--no.
these
caretakers
and
these
children
can't
by
definition
do
that.
that's
why
they're
receiving
regular
afdc.
ms.
katherine
meiss
it's
both
state
and
federal
law.
ms.
katherine
meiss
and
what
i
mean
is
that...
is
that...
yes,
the
foster
care
system
is
again
a
joint...
what
i
mean
is
that
these
individual
children
don't
qualify.
they
don't
meet
these
eligibility
criteria
that
i
was
referring
to,
so
their
family
is
stuck
with
the
regular
afdc
grant,
and
they
cannot
qualify
for
foster
care.
i'd
like
to
talk
for
a
minute
about
what
it
is
that
actually
occurs
when
the
state
combines
the
unit
and
what
actually
happens
to
individuals,
and
in
a
minute
get
back
to
this
question
of
lump
sum
income.
first,
when
they
combine
the
units,
it
violates
the
regulations
at
issue
because
in
so
doing
it
consolidates
the
unit.
it
reduces
the
grant
based
on
the
fact
that
this
individual
lives
with
the
other
folks,
despite
that
there's
no
legal
obligation
of
support
between
those
individuals,
and
perhaps
the
best
example
is
from
our
named
plaintiffs,
the
edwards
household.
the
edwards
household,
when
the
child
first
came
in
they
mistakenly
under
their
rule
paid,
but
correctly
under
our
interpretation,
two
different
units,
two
different
grants,
and
had
two
assistance
units,
so
the
edwards
grant,
when
they
consolidated,
went
for
the
household
from
901
a
month
to
630
a
month.
the
child,
the
needy
niece
who
came
into
the
new
household,
her
grant
went
from
341
a
month
to
210
a
month,
so
what
they're
doing
in
that
situation
is
actually
reducing
the
amount
of
assistance
payment
paid
to
the
household
and
to
the
individual
child
based
on
the
presence
of
the
family
members
and
the
household
together,
even
though
there's
no
legal
duty
to
support.
secondly,
in
violation
of
the
substitute
parent
regulation,
which
says
that
you
can
only
presume
and
make
this
automatic
assumption
that
the
income
of
a
parent
is
going
to
be
available,
they
assume
that
all
people
in
the
household
will
contribute
to
one
another,
and
here
the
example
that
was
asked...
i
think
it
was
justice
ginsburg
asked
about,
if
you
were...
if
the
solicitor
general
were...
allowed
the
family
to
remove
themselves
from
a
lump
sum
income,
they
couldn't
do
that
if
outside
income
came
into
the
home,
and
that's
correct.
so
in
that
situation,
when
somebody
gets,
for
instance,
social
security
death
benefits,
which
are
probably
the
largest
single
source
of
outside
income
in
the
afdc
program,
if
an
individual
such
as
the
child
of
the
caretaker
relative
were
to
receive
those
death
benefits,
then
not
only
would
that...
would
the...
would
they
be
attributable
to
the
parent,
the
mother,
and
to
the
child,
but
they're
also
attributable
to
the
nephew,
and
that
point
there's
nothing--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--that's
simply
incorrect,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
he
meant
to
say,
because
that
is
not
the
rule.
the
rule
is
very
clear
that
if
the
income
comes
into
the
home,
and
you're
in
the
assistance
unit,
then
it
has
to
be
attributed
between
the
individuals
within
that
assistance
unit,
so
once
that
assistance...
and
this
is
why
this
is
important.
once
that
assistance
unit
is
combined,
then
all
the
income
and
resources
that
come
into
that
home
are
attributable
to
the...
to
everybody
in
the
assistance
unit.
ms.
katherine
meiss
who
could?
ms.
katherine
meiss
well,
he
can't
if--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--no.
if
it's
the
child
who
gets
the
money,
the
child
who
gets
the
death
benefit,
the
child
of
the
mother
can't
opt
out
of
the
assistance
unit
without
taking
both
the
mother--
ms.
katherine
meiss
--and
the
child
off...
no.
ms.
katherine
meiss
no.
ms.
katherine
meiss
if
it's
the
nephew
that
gets
the
outside
income?
but
that's
incor...
that's
correct
in
the
future,
the
nephew
might
be
able
to
opt
out.
but
in
our
situation,
for
instance,
we
have
groups
of
multiple
nephews,
so
for
instance,
you
have
two
sets
of
cousins,
two
cousins
each,
okay.
if
this
set
of
cousins
has
no
income
but
this
set
of
cousins
over
here,
one
of
the
two
gets
outside
income,
that
one
cousin
cannot
opt
out,
because
that
cousin
is
brought
in
because
of
his
sibling
being
in
there,
and
so
they're
all
combined,
so
they
would
have
to
stay
in
the
assistance
unit.
the
only
way
you
could
not
count
that
income
is
if
both
of
those
cousins
opted
out,
and
the
problem
with
that
is
that
these
children
are
needy,
and
need
afdc.
it's
slightly
disingenuous,
i
think,
for
the
state
to
suggest
that
these
needy
orphans
or
nephews
need
not
apply,
or
aren't
mandated
to
apply
for
afdc.
they
really
have
no
choice.
i
mean,
they're
in
need.
they're
the
poorest
of
the
poor,
and
so
it's
not
true
that
you
could
opt
out
in
that
case.
and
similarly,
as
i
said,
it's
news
to
me
today
that
with
the
lump
sum
income
rule,
it's
a
similar
kind
of
thing
if
the
individual
got
a
lottery
ticket,
as
you
suggested,
although
the
largest
kind
of
lump
sum
is
typically
social
security
death
benefits
awards.
if
the
individual
got
social
security
death
benefit
awards,
and
that
death
benefit
came
to
the
child
of
the
parent
again,
the
nephew
could
not
opt
out.
i
mean,
that's
what
the
rule
says
now,
and
i'm
surprised
by
what
the
sg
is
saying.
i
think
what
the
solicitor
general
maybe
was
suggesting
is
that
if
it
only
came
to
the
nephew,
then
the
nephew
could
opt
out,
but
since
the
parent
and
the
child
have
to
be
in
the
assistance
unit,
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
that.
ms.
katherine
meiss
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
class
definition
says
that
any
individual...
it's
true
none
of
our
named
plaintiffs
received
a
lump-sum
income,
or
outside
income,
but
the
class
definition
is,
any
individual
affected
by
this
policy,
and
at
the
time
this
was
submitted
to
the
district
court
we
had
a
joint
stipulation
of
undisputed
facts,
and
one
of
those
facts
was
that
outside
income
would
be
treated
in
the
same
way,
so
i
do
believe
the
matter
was
before
the
district
court.
to
summarize,
one
of
the
basic
principles
in
the
afdc
program
is
that
only
income
that
is
actually
available
to
somebody
or
that
they
have
a
legal
entitlement
to
can
be
counted
in
determining
the
grant
and
assistance
payment
amount.
congress
has
recognized
this
principle,
and
has
created
certain
exceptions
to
it.
for
instance,
the
mandatory
filing
unit
rule,
which
we
talked
about
earlier,
42
u.s.c.
(a)(38)
is
one
of
those
exceptions
in
which
it
said
nuclear
family
members
must
be
on
aid
together.
similarly,
the
proration
plan
pursuant
to
42
u.s.c.
612,
which
says
that
you
can
assume
economies
of
scale
and
which
we
say
is
the
method
which
should
be
used
in
this
case,
since
you
have
a
shared
living
situation
with
more
than
one
assistance
unit.
that's
an
exception
to
the
availability
regulation,
and
there
are
other
similar
ones,
such
as
congress
has
now
allowed
the
deeming
of
step-parent
income.
but
congress
has
not
created
an
exception
in
this
case,
and
as
the
state
admits,
it
starts
with
two
assistance
units
and
then
it
combines
those
assistance
units.
that
combination
of
assistance
units
is
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
the
regulations,
and
it's
contrary
to
the
contemporaneous
construction
given
those
regulations
by
their
drafters
when
they
were
adopted.
hhs's
interpretation
there
also
ignores
the
plain
language
and
the
contemporaneous
construction
and
was
not
adopted
pursuant
to
the
apa.
therefore,
no
deference
is
owed
to
that
interpretation.
ms.
katherine
meiss
thank
you,
your
honor.
