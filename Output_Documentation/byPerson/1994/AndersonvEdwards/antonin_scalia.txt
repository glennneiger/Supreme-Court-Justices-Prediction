justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
california's
rule
was,
he
can
pull
out,
but
that
the
time
at
which
the
attribution
is
determined
and
the
drawdown
is
computed
is
the
time
at
which
he
received
the
entitlement
to
that
money,
so
even
if
he
does
get
out
afterwards,
you
have
fixed
the
rule
for
drawdown
of
that
lump
sum
payment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
disagree
with
that
interpretation?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
only
to
opt
out,
but
to
remove
the
drawdown
requirements
from
the
rest
of
the
unit.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
apply
to
a
child,
too,
or
just
a
nephew?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
direct
offspring.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
family-friendly,
if
it's
encouraging
kids
who
win
the
lottery
to
leave
home.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
isn't
necessarily
saving
money.
i
mean,
saving
it.
it's
redistributing
it.
to
the
extent
it...
more
money
goes
to
these
units,
less
money
will
go
to
other
units.
i
mean,
it
isn't
clear
that
this
is
a
net
saving
in
welfare
expenditures,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
does
save
money
with
respect
to
this
unit,
but
if
it
didn't
save
that
money,
every
unit
would
have
to
get
that
much
less.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
necessarily
no,
either.
i
mean,
you
really--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
really
can't
say
the
money's
coming
out
of
welfare.
you
just
don't
know
where
it's
going.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
gather
the
state
is
also
saying,
and
i
guess
the
government
is
agreeing,
that
if
california
wanted
to,
it
could
consider
that
to
be
a
single
unit,
too.
they've
really
chosen
to
say,
we'll
treat
it
as
a
single
unit
when
there's
one
caretaker
for
everybody,
but
i
suppose
their
position
is
that
they...
the
definition
of
the
assistant
unit
is
up
to
them,
and
even
though
there
are
two
caretakers,
they
could,
where
the
two
caretakers
choose
to
live
together
with
the
children,
they
could
call
that
a
single
unit,
too.
isn't
that
their
position,
as
you
understand
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
you
can
only
combine
units
where
they
are
only
a
single
caretaker,
or
at
least
where
everyone
in
the
unit
could
be
under
a
single
caretaker?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
that
limitation
come
from?
why
couldn't
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--create
other
units
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
availability
rules
do
have
something
to
do
with
the
formation
of
units.
i
thought
it
was
your
position
that
the
two
are
quite
separate.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unless
you
accept
the
theory
that
the
respondents
here
have
been
urging,
that
there
is
a
limitation
that
springs--
justice
antonin
scalia
--from
the
attribution
rule.
