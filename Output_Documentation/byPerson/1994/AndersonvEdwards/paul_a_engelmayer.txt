mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
filing
rules
such
as
california's
are
consistent
with
the
regulations
governing
the
afdc
program,
and
that
is
the
longstanding
view
of
the
secretary
of
health
&
human
services.
california's
rule
simply
ensures
that
single
caretaker
families
with
the
same
number
of
dependent
children
and
the
same
financial
resources
receive
the
same
amount
of
aid,
otherwise,
as
my
cocounsel
has
observed,
there
would
be
a
disparity
of
aid
simply
between
two
families,
simply
because
the
children
in
one
family
happen
to
be
siblings
and
the
children
in
the
other
were
not.
eliminating
that
disparity
was,
in
our
view,
one
of
a
number
of
permissible
ways
that
california
had
to
allocate
its
finite
afdc
resources.
under
this
court's
decisions
in
dandridge
and
in
jefferson,
the
state
alternatively
could
have
put
a
flat
ceiling
on
the
family
grant
regardless
of
the
number
of
children
in
the
unit,
in
the
family,
and
it
alternatively
could
have
reduced
across
the
board
the
level
of
benefits.
california's
judgment
was
that
the
approach
it's
taken
was
the
most
fair
one,
and
under
the
social
security
act,
it
was
california's
prerogative
to
balance
those
equities.
the...
as
for
the
availabilities
rule,
the
availability
regulations,
those
address
a
different
situation
entirely.
they
forbid
a
state
from
imputing
income
either
to
a
dependent
child
or
a
group
of
dependent
children
from
an
outside
source
unless
that
outside
source
has
a
legal
duty
to
provide
that
support.
they
do
not
prevent
a
state
from
assuming
that
children
under
the
care
of
the
same
caretaker
will
share
amongst
themselves.
that's
clear
both
from
the--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--that's
absolutely
right,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
i
think
they
do.
the
regulations
are
printed
on
pages
30
through
32
of
the
petition
appendix,
and
i
think
the
dispositive
language
is
as
follows:
the
regulations
forbid
a
state
from
including...
from
attributing
income
to
somebody
because
either
they
are...
attributing
income
from
a
person
because
they
are
either
present
in
the
same
household
or
included
in
the
same
family.
but
california
has
a
different
basis
for
grouping
children
together,
and
that
is
that
in
addition
to
being
included
in
the
same
household
and
present
in
the
same
family,
those
children
are
also
claiming
afdc
with
the
same
caretaker.
in
other
words,
there's
a
different
triggering
criterion
here.
that's
clear,
for
example,
on
page...
on
appendix
30,
the
regulation
there.
they
refer
to...
it
refers
to
support,
for
the
support
of
the
assistance
unit,
making
it
implicitly
clear
that
it
is
support
from
outside
of
the
group
of
people
claiming
aid.
i
think
in
this
respect
the
rule
simply
is
drawing...
what
california
has
done
is
simply
drawing
on
a
broader
premise
in
the
act,
which
is
that
family
members
share.
that
was
reflected
in
this
court's
decision
in
bowen
with
regard
to
child
support
payments,
where
the
court
noted
that
the
possibility
that
one
child's
use
of...
the
use
of
funds
earmarked
for
one
child
solely
for
the
selfish
benefit
of
that
one
child
is
really
more
of
a
theoretical
than
a
practical--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--there
are
two
answers
to
that,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--he
is
a
nonlegally
responsible
individual,
but
he's
being
included
with
the
other
child
not
solely
because
of
his
presence
in
the
household,
but
rather
because,
in
addition
to
being
in
the
household,
he
has
claimed
afdc
with
the
same
caretaker.
california
is
not
simply
saying
that
any
nephew
or
uncle
in
the
household,
regardless
of
whether
they've
claimed
aid,
has
that
person's
income
attributed
to
those--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--or
it's...
or
presence
in
the
household.
it's
not
simply
presence
in
the
household.
california
could
not,
in
our
view,
under
the
availability
regulations
require
that
income
be
attributed
from
somebody
purely
because
they
lived
in
the
same
house,
even
if
there
was
some--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--or,
more
practically,
the
fact
that
that
person
is
having
aid
claimed
for
themselves
under
the
auspices
of
the
same
caretaker.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
justice
o'connor,
we
disagree
with
that.
our
position
with
regard
to
the
lump
sum
rule
is
as
follows:
that
602(a)(17)
of
the
statute
does
prohibit
the
assistance
unit
from
claiming
money
for
the
period
of
time
determined
by
dividing
the
lump
sum
by
the
standard
of
need,
however
many
months
that
might
be.
however,
we
believe
that
a
person
can
opt
out
both
beforehand,
if
they
anticipate
the
receipt
of
money,
or
afterwards,
either
by
physically
leaving
the
household
or
withdrawing
their
application
in
subsequent
months
for
afdc.
i
think
otherwise
you
do
have
a
problem
of
unavailability
in
this
respect:
if
the
premise
of
the
rules
here
is...
of
the
availability
rules
is
that
the
inclusion
in
the
household
is
not
enough,
once
somebody
has
simply
said
in
an
emancipatory...
in
a
way
in
which
they're
essentially
announcing
their
emancipation,
i
no
longer
belong
to
this
assistance
unit,
i
am
not
longer
under
the
presence...
under
the
auspices
of
this
caretaker,
it
then
becomes
simply
a
matter
of
that
person's
income
being
attributed
purely
because
of
their
presence
in
the
household,
so
we
would
think
there's
a
problem.
at
the
same
time--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--we
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
that...
we
do,
however,
feel
that
that
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
it
is
a
facial
challenge.
none
of
the
plaintiffs
have
alleged
that
they
anticipate
to
receive
lump
sum
payments.
to
the
extent--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--justice
scalia,
i
think
you've
correctly
interpreted
the
way
california
applies--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--we
disagree
with
that.
we
believe
that
there
should
be
an
opportunity
to
opt
out
for
those
people
not
required
by
federal
law--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--that's
right.
i
think
it
simply
would
be
a
matter
of--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--after
winning
the
lottery
for
successive
afdc
periods,
which
are
months.
i
think...
because
otherwise
you
really
are
truly
saying
of
the
nephew
who
is
no
longer
claiming
afdc,
purely
because
you're
present
in
the
same
household,
we
are
going
to
block
your
cousins,
if
you
will,
from
receiving
aid.
i
think
that
does
implicate
the
same
policy
concerns
as
the
availability
rule,
and
the
language
of
it
would
seem
squarely
to
speak
to
that
issue.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
well,
if
you're...
by
child
you
mean
a
direct
offspring--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--well,
direct
offspring,
if
you
have
two
siblings,
then--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--not
to
leave
home--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--in
fact,
that's...
our
view
is
that
the
person
need
not
leave
home,
but
simply
in
this
next
month
not
have
afdc
claimed
for
themselves.
i
think
it
is
important--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--for
that...
for
that
next
month,
that's
absolutely
right.
now,
of
course,
if
a
particular
child
was
anticipating...
if
a
family
realized
that
a
child
in
the
unit
was
going
to
be
receiving
a
decent
amount
of
money
that
was
not
disregarded
under
the
act
in
subsequent
months,
such
as
to
reduce
the
family's
old
grant,
california's
rule
permits
the
family
not
to
claim
aid
for
that
child
in
subsequent
months,
justice
ginsburg,
and
so
as
a
result
there
is
flexibility
here.
all
california
is
simply
saying
is,
if
you
do
actually
elect
to
claim
afdc
with
the
same
caretaker,
you
should
be
grouped
together
much
as
you
would
be
if
you
were
siblings.
i
think
in
that
regard
it's
very
important
just
to
emphasize
the
limited
impact
of
this
rule.
it
doesn't
force
anybody
to
apply
to
afdc.
congress
went
further
by
requiring
the
inclusion
of
immediate
family.
the
state
here
has
simply
said,
only
if
you
apply
must
you
be
included.
in
the
second
respect,
i
think
the
concerns
that
the
respondents
have
raised
about
the
attribution
of
outside
income
are
somewhat
overblown.
section
602(a)(8)(a)
of
the
statute
provides
that
the
earned
income
of
any
child
claiming
afdc
while
still
a
student
is
100-percent
disregarded
in
order
to
ensure
that
there
is
some
remaining
incentive
for
that
person
to
continue
to
work.
in
all
likelihood,
that's
going
to
be
the
overwhelming
amount
majority
of
cases
where
outside
income
is
being
brought
into
the
unit
by
a
child
in
that
unit.
i'd
like
to
address
briefly
the
court
of
appeals
rationale
here.
they
equated
the
caretaker
with
the
man
in
the
house,
so-called,
from
king
v.
smith
on
the
grounds
that
neither
might
be
legally
responsible
under
state
law
for
particular
children,
such
as
a
niece
or
a
nephew.
that
was
wrong
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
it's
the
statute,
not
the
filing
rule,
which
puts
the
caretaker,
an
extended
family
member,
in
the
role
of
caretaker.
that's
in
section
606(a),
which
defines
the
caretaker
to
include
aunts,
uncles,
nieces,
nephews,
cousins.
as
a
result,
a
rule
that
simply
consolidates
two
assistance
units
gives--
