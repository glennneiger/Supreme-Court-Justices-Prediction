mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether,
everything
else
being
equal,
a
state
may
provide
the
same
amount
of
afdc
benefits
to
a
family
where
the
dependent
children
are
all
related
to
their
caretaker,
but
are
not
siblings
of
one
another,
as
the
state
does
where
the
children
are
all
brothers
and
sisters
of
one
another.
california
and
28
other
states
have
adopted
a
rule
that
requires
the
combination
of
assistance
units
when
there
are
more...
when
there
are
two
or
more
assistance
units
residing
in
the
same
household
with
the
same
caretaker
relative.
california
also
requires
the
combination
of
assistance
units
if
there
are
two
caretaker
relatives
and
they
are
married
to
each
other.
the
full
text
of
california's
regulation
is
set
forth
at
the...
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
note
3
on
page
17,
note
3
in
the
district
court
opinion.
the
fundamental
error
committed
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
in
the
beaton
case,
which
was
the
case
the
district
court
relied
on
in
ruling
in
this
case
and
which
the
ninth
circuit
simply
followed
in
affirming
the
district
court
in
this
case,
was
to
look
at
the
federal
income
rules
before
looking
at
the
question
of
whether
the
state
has
the
discretion
and
the
right
to
require
afd
recipients
who
live
together
in
the
same
household
to
be
considered
one
assistance
unit
for
purposes
of
computing
the
grant
that
they
receive
from
the
state.
in
essence,
the
ninth
circuit
put
the
cart
before
the
horse.
it
looked
at
the
income
availability
rules
before
looking
at
the
state's
discretion
to
decide
that
assistance
units
and
groups
of
afdc
recipients
living
in
the
same
household
may
be
combined.
the
rule
that
we
are
proposing
that
the
court
adopt
in
this
case
is
that
under
cooperative
federalism,
which
this
court
has
recognized
is
the
afdc
system
that
congress
has
enacted,
the
states
have
the
discretion
to
make
this
kind
of
a
rule,
that
assistance
units
living
in
the
same
household
be
combined,
a
part
of
their
afdc
program.
to
put
that
another
way,
we're
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
neither
congress
nor
the
secretary
of
health
&
human
services
have...
by
express
edict,
where
that
is
the
only
way
the
state's
discretion
may
be
circumscribed
in
the
afdc
programs,
have
taken
that
discretion
away
from
the
states.
i
would
like
to
illustrate
first
how
the
rule
works
in...
with
a
practical
example,
and
then
i
would
like
to
make
four
points.
first
of
all,
the
points
i
would
like...
just
briefly
going
through
the
points
i
would
like
to
make
this
morning,
first
of
all,
deciding
who
must
be
in
an
afdc
assistance
unit
is
largely
a
matter
of
state
discretion,
just
as
the
state
has
a
right
to
decide
how
poor
a
person
has
to
be
before
they
receive
benefits
and
how
much
afdc
benefits
the
state
should
pay
that
person.
the
second
point,
when
assistance
units
are
combined,
the
income
and
resources
of
all
the
persons
in
that
household
who
are
claiming
afdc
are
considered
as
available
to
every
other
member
of
that
unit.
the
availability
rules
really
relate
to
the
situation
after
the
assistance
units
are
combined,
and
determining
whether
the
individual
has
income
available
to
that
person
such
that
it
then,
because
of
the
combination
of
the
assistance
units
and
the
operation
of
the
federal
statute--
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
--well,
your
honor...
your
honor's
question--
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
--your
question
implicates
the
lump
sum
rule.
first
of
all,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
once
the
assistance
unit
is
combined,
the
income
and
resources
that
are
available
to
each
of
those
individuals
are
considered
available
to
the
unit
as
a
whole.
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
well,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
your
honor,
there
is
a
federal
family
filing
unit
rule
in
section
602(a)(38)
of
42
u.s.c.
which
provides
that
if
the...
where
congress
provided
in
1984
that
the
father,
mother,
and
brothers
and
sisters,
all
of
whom
live
in
the
same
household,
their
needs
and
income
must
be
considered
together,
such
that
if
one
of
those
individuals
receives
a
lottery
winning
or
a
lump
sum
income
of
some
kind,
that
person,
that
income
is
deemed
available
to
all
the
individuals.
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
under
current
california
interpretation
of
federal
requirements
and
federal
regulations,
no.
the...
however,
that...
i
would
want
to
make
clear,
first
of
all,
that
is
not...
none
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
present
that
set
of
facts.
the
class
definition
does
not
include
a
plaintiff
such
as
that,
such
as
one
who
has
outside
income,
and
i
believe
the
court
can
decide
this
case
without
reaching
those
income...
the
lump
sum
rule
which
is
provided
by
federal
law
under
subdivision
602(a)(17)
of
the,
42
u.s.c.--
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
--well,
your
honor,
that
person
would
not
be
eligible
for
afdc,
because
the
persons
eligible
for
afdc
are
limited
to
dependent
children
under
the
age
of
21
and
their
caretaker
relative.
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
if
he
lived
with
that
household,
his
income
would
not
be
considered
available
to
the
others,
in
the
same
way,
your
honor,
as,
for
instance,
mrs.
edwards,
who
is
one
of
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
she
is
not
a
needy
caretaker.
in
other
words,
she
is
not
receiving
afdc
on
her
own
behalf
as
a
caretaker
of
her
children.
her
income...
if
she
received
a
lottery
payment,
that
income
would
not
be
deemed
available
to
the
children
in
the
unit.
simply,
we're
talking
about
the
members
of
the
assistance
unit,
those
persons
claiming
afdc,
and
that's
what
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
cases
this
court
decided
in
the
late
sixties
and
early
seventies,
where
we
were
dealing
with,
in
king,
a
man
in
the
house,
a
substitute
father,
or
a
lodger,
as
was
the
case
in
van
lare.
those
situations
involved
a
person
who
is
not
a
member
of
the
assistance
unit.
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
no,
if...
as
long
as
they're
nephews.
if
they
were
her
children,
then
they--
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
--no,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
they
could
not
mandate
that
she
be
in
the
unit.
she
does
not
have
to
apply
for
afdc
unless
she
wants
to.
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
that's
correct.
the
third
point,
which
i
have
actually
to
some
extent
already
addressed,
was
that
the
rule
is
essentially...
is
a
very
logical
rule.
in
other
words,
we're
talking
about
individuals
who
are
all
applying
for
afdc,
and
it
fits
the
same
kind
of
rationale
and
logic
as
the
family
filing
unit
rule,
which
is
the
federal
rule
that
a
nuclear
family,
all
individuals
in
a
nuclear
family,
must
be
considered
together,
and
their
income
and
resources
must--
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
--if...
only
physically,
essentially.
if
the
nephew
went
to
live
with
another
family,
and
therefore
those
winnings--
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
--if
that
person
was
in
an
afdc
recipient...
in
an
assistance
unit
and
be
receiving
afdc
at
the
time,
that
person...
that
person's
income
would
be
deemed
available
to
the
other
nephew.
i
assume
that's...
if
it's...
assuming
it's
his
brother.
if
it's
not
his
brother,
then
we're
talking
about
two
assistance
units,
but
if
it's
his
brother,
he
would
be...
he
would
have
to
be...
that
income
would
then
disqualify
both
of
those
individuals
from
receipt
of
afdc
for
such
time
as
it
takes
the
family
to
spend
that
money
down.
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
well,
your
honor,
in
that
situation,
currently
under
california
law
and
policy,
the
individual
would
not
be
able
to...
once
the
income
was
received,
the
individuals
would
be
deemed...
who
are
in
that
assistance
unit
at
that
point
would
be
deemed
to
be
ineligible
for
such
time
as
it
takes
to
spend
the
money
down.
if
the
family
anticipates
the
receipt
of
the
lump
sum
ahead
of
time
and
can
essentially
send
the
cousin
to
live
with
rich
aunt
mary
instead
of
living
in
the
assistance
unit,
then
that
income
then
would
not
be
considered
as
available,
essentially
taking
the
person
out
of
that
situation.
if
the...
the
state
has
not...
at
this
point
does
not
have
any
regulations
governing
this,
and
again
the
situa...
factual
situation
is
not
presented
by
the
facts
of
this
case
and
therefore
it's
not...
was
not
developed
in
the
court
below.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
dealing
with
the
situation.
the...
if
i
could
just
illustrate
briefly
how
the
rule
works,
if
we
consider
two
families
living
next
door
to
each
other
in
the
same
town
in
the
state
of
california,
one
family
headed
by
a
single
caretaker
relative,
three
minor
children
are
in
the
home,
and
each
child
is
determined
to
be
eligible
for
afdc
as
being
deprived
of
support
and
care
of
one
of
that
person's
parents,
and
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
children
and
the
caretaker
are
all
financially
needy.
the...
in
one
household
there's
a
single
mother
and
her
three
children.
in
that
household,
under
federal
law
and
under
state
law,
there's
only
one
assistance
unit,
a
four-person
assistance
unit
because
the
caretaker
is
also
eligible
for
afdc,
and
in
california,
currently
that
four-person
assistance
unit
would
receive
a
maximum
grant
of
723.
the
other
household
right
next
door,
single
mother,
one
child,
takes
in
two
grandchildren.
her
eldest
daughter
has
died,
or
is...
has
abandoned
the
children.
in
that
household,
there
are
two
assistance
units.
initially,
there
are
two
assistance
units,
one
made
up
of
the
mother
and
her
child,
the
other
made
up
of
the
two
grandchildren.
california's
rule
simply
provides
that
in
that
instance
where
there
are
two
assistance
units,
one
relative
caretaker,
that
the
assistance
units
be
combined.
if
the
assistance
units
are
combined,
that
family
receives
the
same
maximum
aid
payment
as
does
the
first
family,
723
a
month,
irrespective
of
whether
that's
determined
to
be
an
adequate
amount
for
purposes
of
support
or
not.
that's
really
not
the
issue
here.
the
issue
is,
we
have
two
families
that
are
similarly
sized
and
essentially
similarly
situated,
a
single
caretaker
and
three
minor
children.
if
there
are...
if
the
state's
rule
cannot
be
enforced
and
we
have
to
have
two
assistance
units
in
that
family,
then
the
state
has
to
pay
out
980
to
that
second
family
because
there
are
two
two-person
assistance
units,
each
of
which
receive,
under
current
california
law,
a
maximum
aid
payment
of
490.
obviously,
the
reason
for
the
assistance
unit
rule,
the
combination-of-assistance
unit
rule
that
we
have
suggested,
is
that
the
state
sees
this
as
a
way
of
treating
families
who
are
similarly
sized
the
same,
and
it
also
saves
money.
there's
no
debate
about
that.
it
does
save
money
for
the
state
of
california.
the...
i
would
like
to
address
briefly,
because
i'd
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal,
the...
our
rule
is
different
from
the
family
filing
unit
rule,
which
is
the
federal
rule
that
mandates
a
nuclear
family,
the
children,
the
brothers
and
sisters,
parents,
step-parents
and...
not
step-parents,
excuse
me.
i
misspoke...
the
parents
and
natural
children
or
adopted
children
of
that
family
be
considered
together.
that
in
a
sense,
congress
in
a
sense
took
the
option
away
from
recipients
to
exclude
persons
from
the
assistance
units
that
may
have
income
that
would
disqualify
them
or
would
disqualify
the
family,
or
result
in
less
benefits
for
the
family.
that
rule
forces
individuals
into
an
assistance
unit,
and
congress
can
do
that.
congress
can
say,
irrespective
of
the
availability-of-income
principle
in
the
regulations,
we're
going
to
require
that
these
individuals
be
together
in
an
assistance
unit.
california's
rule
doesn't
force
anybody
to
apply
for
afdc.
california's
rule
simply
says,
if
you're
going
to
apply
for
afdc,
and
under
the
circumstances
of
the
rule
a
single
caretaker
relative,
all
those
individuals
in
the
household
must
be
considered,
their
needs
and
resources
must
be
considered
together.
so
we're
really
not...
and
what
we're
really
looking
at
then
is
whether
the
federal
regulations
in
some
way
have
prohibited
that,
and
we
submit
that
they
do
not,
that
the
regulations
only
come
into
play
after
the
assistance
unit
is
formed
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
individual
is...
has
income
and
resources
that
are
available
to
that
individual
such
that
they
would
be
deemed
available
to
the
rest
of
the
assistance
unit.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
the...
on
the
last
point
regarding
the
combination
of
assistance
units
being
a...
somehow
the
boogie
man
in
this
case,
the
combination
of
assistance
units
as...
the
state's
right
to
combine
assistance
units
in
this
instance
has
always
been
the
interpretation
of
the
department
of
health
&
human
services
and
its
predecessor,
the
department
of
health,
education
&
welfare.
that's
always
been
its
interpretation.
it's
true
that
the
department
or
the
secretary
only
addressed
the
question
of
the
availability
regulations
in
the
most
recent
action
transmittal,
the
one
that's
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
was
issued
in
1994.
it's
true
that
the
secretary
only
addressed
the
availability
regulations
at
that
point.
however,
the
secretary
is
presumed
to
know
what
its...
what
his
or
her
regulations
are,
and
the
earlier
interpretations,
which
were
interpretations...
not
changes
in
the
rules,
but
interpretations,
which
do
not
need
to
be
adopted
pursuant
to
the
administrative
procedures
act,
were...
are
consistent,
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
combine
assistance
units
in
this
instance.
and
i
believe
that
there...
although
the
current
california
rule
says
that
only
an
assistance
unit
where
there's
a
single
caretaker
relative
and
children
who
are
not
siblings
of
one
another,
or
two
caretakers
of
separate
assistance
units
who
are
married
to
each
other
or
have
a
child
in
common,
if
those
are
the
only
situations
the
state
has
currently
addressed,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
state
could
not
address
the
further
situation
which
was
discussed
at
some
length
by
respondents'
counsel,
that
if
there
were
two
sisters
living
in
the
same
house,
each
with
their
own
children,
again
we're
talking
about
individuals
either
one
of
whom
could
be
the
caretaker
for
her
sister's
children,
for
her
nieces,
for
her
nephews.
in
that
instance,
i
believe
it's
perfectly
consistent
with
the
understanding
of
who
a
caretaker
can
be,
that
the
state
can
combine
those
assistance
units
in
that
case.
secondly,
i
think
the...
in
the
arguments
about
the--
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
--i
believe
that
is...
that
would
be
the
limitation
of--
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
--the
limitation--
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
--well,
the
limitation
does
come
from
the
availability
rules,
that
if
you
were
dealing
with
a
situation
of
a
man
in
the
house,
the
mother's
boyfriend,
who's
not
the
father
of
the
children,
who's
not
applying
for
afdc,
i
think
that's
a
limitation.
that
would
prevent...
the
availability
rules
would
prevent
the
state
from
imputing
the
income
of
that
person,
that
person
who
is
not
in
the
assistance
unit
who
just
happens
to
be
living
in
the
house.
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
well,
to
the
extent
that
all
the
persons...
well,
let
me
clarify.
to
the
extent
that
all
the
persons
in
the
household
are
applying
for
afdc,
we
would
take
the
position
in
general
that
they
could
be
put
in
the
same
assistance
unit.
however,
if
you
had
an
assistance
unit,
two
groups
of
people
living
in
the
same
house,
one
headed
by
a
woman
who
is
not
related
to
another
woman,
also
living
in
the
house,
they
each
have
their
own
children,
we
could
not
combine
assistance
units
in
that
instance,
because
then
there
is
absolutely
no...
the
two
sisters--
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
--the
two
women
are
not
related.
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
well,
there's
a
limitation,
your
honor--
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
--there's
a
limitation
that
arises
out
of
606(a)
of
42
u.s.c.,
which
lists
those
individuals
who
can
be
caretaker
relatives.
caretaker
relatives
have
to
be
related
to
the
children
that
they
are
caring
for.
in
other
words,
when
you
have
two
sisters
that
are
related
by
means
of
an
aunt,
niece
or
nephew
relationship,
so
that
is
a
difference.
i
would
like
to
address
a
question
that
justice
kennedy
asked,
that
you
asked
earlier
about
the
guardian,
the...
assuming
that
there
was
a
receipt
of
some
money
by
an
individual
that
was
in
a
blocked
guardianship
account.
the
family,
under
the
lump
sum
rules
as
they're
currently
constituted,
does
have
the
option
of
trying
to
prove
to
the
welfare
department
that
the
money
is
not
available,
not
actually
available.
they
could
present
that,
and
if
it's
not...
has
nothing
to
do
with...
it's
not
something
that's
under
the
control
of
that
family
why
it's
unavailable,
they
could
go
ahead
and
try
to
prove
that,
and
if
it's
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
welfare
department
they
would
not
consider
that
income
as
available
to
the
rest
of
the
members
of
the
assistance
unit.
the...
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
history
of
the
regulations
in
addition
to
their
plain
language,
i
think
it's
very
clear,
if
you
look
at
this
court's
decisions
in
king
and
van
lare
and
lewis
from
the
late
sixties,
early
seventies--
mr.
dennis
paul
eckhart
--thank
you,
your
honor.
