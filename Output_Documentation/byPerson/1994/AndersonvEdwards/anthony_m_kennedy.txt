justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
one
of
the
dependents
is
not
the
outside
source.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
the
regulations
make
that
clear?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
page
30
i
think
that
may
be
the
thrust
of
the
regulation,
but--
--page
30
of
what?
of
the
appendix,
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari.
the
phrase
is
"nonlegally
responsible
individual".
why
isn't
the
nephew
who
is
in
the
unit
and
who
has
the
money,
why
isn't
he
a
nonlegally
responsible
individual?
suppose
that
his
money
is
in
a
court-ordered
guardianship
account
because
it's
a
tort
claim
not
available
to
him
until
he's
18?
you
would
attribute
that
money
to
the
unit,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
he
a
nonlegally
responsible
individual?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
see,
so
it's
the
word
"solely"
that
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
the
difference,
then,
is
between
presence
in
the
household
and,
i
take
it,
membership
in
the
unit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
doesn't
say...
it
says
solely.
--solely.
it
says
solely.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
think
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
the
regulation
you
have
to
quote
it
accurately.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
says
solely,
and
i
think
that's
a
very
important
word.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
they
are
doing
it
because
he's
a
member
of
the
unit
receiving
payments.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
that's
their
argument,
but--
