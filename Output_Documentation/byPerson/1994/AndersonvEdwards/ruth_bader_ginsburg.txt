suppose
it's
his
cousin
and
they
had
been
in
the
same
unit
under
this
california
whatever,
unit
filing
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
after
winning
the
lottery?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that
would
not
be
the
case
if
what
the
person
got
in
a
lump
sum
wasn't
enough
to
take
that
person
off
afdc,
so
they
would
still...
then
the
income
would
be
attributed
to
everyone
in
the
unit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ms.
meiss,
you're--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you're
always
up
against
a
hard
argument
when
you
say,
it
violates
the
plain
meaning,
and
these
are
regulations
of
the
hhs.
they
interpret
them
differently.
twenty-eight
states
interpret
them
differently.
some
courts
have
interpreted
them
differently,
and
yet
you
say
there
is
only
one
plain
meaning.
are
the
rest
of
the
people
unreasonable,
who
have
interpreted
it
another
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
do
we
owe
no
deference
to
the
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
regulations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
your
evidence
of
a
contemporaneous
interpretation
different
from
the
one
the
secretary
is
now
advancing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
secretary
ever
take
a
position
that
states
could
not
combine
the
two
units,
as
california
and
28
states
do?
did
the
secretary...
i
thought
the
secretary
had
always
accepted
that
that
was
the
states'
option.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they're
arguing
that
it's
susceptible
to
its
reading.
you
are
saying
there's
only
one
way
to
read
this
regulation,
and
the
secretary
is
saying
that
it's
reasonable
to
read
it
our
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
by
your
argument--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
have
to
say
that
this
language
is
clear
and
leaves
no
room
for
interpretation,
even
though
the
secretary
responsible
for
the
regulation
has
argued
otherwise.
you
are,
in
effect,
asking
us
to
reject
the
secretary's
own
interpretation
and
the
interpretation
of
the
courts
that
have
disagreed
with
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
have
given
deference
to
the
secretary's
position
even
in
cases
where
her
position
is
not
stated
in
a
rulemaking.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
is
the
three
availability
regulations
and
not
any
statutory
peg
that
you...
on
which
you
base
your
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
matching
inequities
that
the
state
presents
to
us
if
we
were
to
adopt
your
view
of
this...
they
have
it
set
out
graphically
on
page
39
of
their
brief...
and
the
comparison
that
they
make
among
units
that
they
assert
are
similarly
situated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there's
not
between
a
brother
and
sister,
but
that's
by
statute,
i
suppose.
