does
the
rule
only
apply
insofar
as
people
in
the
household
are
asking
for
the
federal-state
assistance
to
them?
in
other
words,
suppose
you
had
one
member
of
any
of
the
units
involved
here
who
won
a
big
pile
of
money
on
a
lottery
ticket,
could
that
person
opt
out
of
welfare
benefits
and
the
state
couldn't
force
those
who
remained
to
consider
that
person's--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--money?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can
someone
opt
out
of
the
unit
and
say,
i
don't
want
assistance
any
more,
so
don't
count
me
in?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let's
say
it
is
not
a
father,
mother,
and
their
children.
we
have
these...
a
nephew
or
a
cousin
or
something
in
the
household.
can
somebody
who
receives
outside
money
opt
out
of
the
unit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
a
care...
but
the
caretaker
could
presumably
have,
if
it's
a
woman,
her
own
resources,
and
if
she
takes
into
the
household
a
couple
of
indigent
nephews,
i
take
it
she
could
apply
for
afdc
assistance
for
the
nephews
and
not
herself--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
california
couldn't
mandate
that
she
be
in
the
unit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
i
said
nephews.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
can't
consider
her
income
in
determining
what
the
nephews
get?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
to
clarify
it...
these
regulations
are
very
confusing
to
me...
the
nonneedy
caretaker
with
the
two
indigent
nephews,
and
one
of
the
nephews
comes
into
some
money,
they're
both
in
the
assistance
unit,
but
later
one
of
the
nephews
comes
into
some
money,
gets
a
tort
claim
or
a
lottery
ticket
or
something
and
has
money,
can
that
lucky
nephew
get
out
of
the
unit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
stays
right
there
in
the
household,
but
doesn't
want
the
benefits
any
more.
he
says,
count
me
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
except
california's
attorney
here
today
says
that
someone
can't
opt
out
of
the
assistance
unit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
california
can't
have
a
different
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
rule
only
applies
if
the
caretaker
is
also
applying
for
assistance--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
that
the
point?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
this
situation,
can
the
caretaker
be
eligible
under
the
foster
care
program,
and
apply
to
be--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
foster
parent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
caretaker
couldn't
go
to
the
court
and
say,
please
do
what's
necessary--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
i
thought
the
solicitor
general's
attorney
said
that
person
could
opt
out
of
the
unit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
nephew
could.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it's
a
nephew,
the
nephew
can
opt
out--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--according
to
the
sg.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
we
don't
really
have
the
opt-out
situation
and
the
lump-sum
question
before
us
here.
