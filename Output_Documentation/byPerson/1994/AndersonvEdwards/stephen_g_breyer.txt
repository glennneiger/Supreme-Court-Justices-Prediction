justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
the...
it
sounded
to
me
like
a
compromise,
like
the
two
nephews
and
the
two
children
are
there.
okay,
that's
four,
and
there's
the
sister,
and
now...
so
there's
one
adult
and
there
are
the
four
children.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
am
i
right,
it
seems
to
say,
look,
for
purposes
of
what
the
grant
size
is,
we're
going
to
give
you
as
if
it
were
four
regular
children.
that's...
we're
going
to
treat
them
the
same.
for
purposes
of
attributing
the
income
of
this
adult,
it
can
be
attributed
to
her
two
real
children,
but
it
can't
be
attributed
to
the
nieces
and
nephews.
now,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
if
both
of
those
are
right,
that
doesn't
sound
illogical.
it
sounds
as
if
it's
a
kind
of
compromise:
we'll
treat
them
as
one
family
for
the
purposes
of
how
much
the
grant
is,
but
we'll
treat
them
as
two
families
when
we
try
to
do
the
attribution,
the
reason
being
that
we
want
to
encourage
the
aunt
to
take
in
the
other
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what's
wrong...
what
have
i
said
that...
i'm
trying
to
understand
it.
what's
wrong
with
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
i
just
suggested?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
empirical
information?
i
take
it
underlying
their
theory
is
that
a
man
or
a
woman
who's
looking
after
four
children
will
probably
treat
them,
and
life
will
go
on
roughly
the
same,
whether
those
four
children
are
four
direct
children,
or
two
children
and
two
nephews,
and
on
its
face
you'd
think...
i
don't
know
the
details
and
facts,
but
probably
that's
by
and
large
true.
at
least,
they
argue
that
it
is,
or
at
least
the
state
could
find
that.
is
there
any
information
that
suggests
it
isn't
true?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
he
could
opt
out
of
the
assistance
unit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
one
who
gets
the
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
can't
opt
out
of
the
assistance
unit?
