justice
john
paul
stevens
your
position
is
that
this
is
an
aggravation
case,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
i
understand
you
correctly
that
even
though
there
might
have
been
a
symptom
of
the
disease
before
the
vaccination,
therefore
it's
not...
therefore
what
happened
after
the
vaccination
is
not
the
first
symptom
of
the
onset,
nevertheless,
i
understand
your
position,
there
could
be
a
serious
aggravation
caused
by
the
vaccine,
and
the
first
symptom
of
that
was
the
seizure
within
3
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
there...
but
that's
not
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals,
or
am
i
right
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
make
two
arguments.
1)
you
say
the
small
head
size
is
not
a
symptom.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
one
of
your
arguments.
and
alternatively
you
argue,
under
the
table,
that
the
seizure
within
3
days,
or
whatever
the
period
was,
was
the
first
symptom
of
a
serious
aggravation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
have
two
alternative
arguments.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
correct,
is
it
not,
that
your
opponent
does
rely
in
part
on
it
being
an
aggravation
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
theory
of
the
special
master
was,
you
compare
the
condition
at
the
time
of
the
vaccination
with
the
condition
in
the
long
run,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
opponent's
argument
is
that
the
seizure
itself
was
an
aggravation,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
what
the
table...
that's
the
theory
of
the
table
under
his
view
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
that
the
seizure...
as
to
the
first
seizure
the
child
had?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
at
least
there's
an
argument
that
hasn't
been
resolved
by
the
courts
below
as
to
whether
that
might
itself
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
table.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
symptom
or
a...
a
first
symptom
or
manifestation,
or
of
the
significant
aggravation.
it
seems
to
me
that...
it
seems
to
me,
in
other
words,
the
statute
could
be
satisfied
by
someone
who's
perfectly
healthy,
if
they
had
the
wrong
symptom.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
if
they're
a
symptom,
that's
all
the
statute
requires,
and
that's
what
you're
opponent
argues
here
in
his
alternative
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
manifestation
is
in
the
dysjunctive,
compared
to
symptom,
symptom
or
manifestation.
