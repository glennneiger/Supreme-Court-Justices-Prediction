mr.
gornstein,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
to
question
1
in
the
cert
petition,
do
we
need
to
reach
the
question
of
the
standards
under
question
2,
as
posed
in
the
cert
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
respondent
spends
a
good
deal
of
time
discussing
how
the
district
court
might
have
reached
the
wrong
conclusion
on
the
facts
here.
i
assume
all
of
those
matters
are
open
on
remand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
counsel,
the
special
master
found
that
the
child
had
not,
in
fact,
suffered
a
residual
seizure
disorder,
and
you
didn't
petition
for
cert
on
that.
i
didn't
think
that
was
before
us
here.
the
ca
fed
has
not
addressed
that,
has
it?
i
just
didn't
think
that
argument
was
even
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
you
were
just
arguing
this
residual
seizure
disorder
point,
and
i
understood
that
that
issue
was
not
here.
it
was
decided
against
you
by
the
special
master,
and
it
isn't
here.
