mr.
gornstein,
if
we
had
only
the
language
that
was
in
that
table
and
not
the
statutory
language,
wouldn't
there
be
more
of
a
case
for
the
opposite
interpretation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
difference
in
the
two
briefs...
you
refer
to
a
scientific
term,
and
the
plaintiffs
refer
to
small
head,
not
conceding
that
that
was
any
kind
of
symptom
of
any
malady.
is
that
what
the
dispute--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
a
matter,
counsel,
for
medical
judgment,
and
weren't
there
expert
witnesses
who
testified
that
that
was
a
manifestation,
or
symptom,
of
the
ultimate
disability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
did
the
experts
who
testified
in
this
case
call
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
say
it's
not
a...
let's
leave
aside
the
aggravation
point.
if
you're
just
talking
about
the
first
symptom
of
the
illness,
then
you
would
agree
that
you
must
show
not
only
that
there
was
a
symptom
within
the
table
time
after
the
vaccination,
but
that
it
was
the
first
symptom.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
point
to
the
words
in
the
finder
of
fact's
findings
that
say
what
you've
just
summarized?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
moxley,
in
answer
to
the
question
that
was
asked,
i
think
that
there
was
something
the
fact-finder
said.
he
said...
this
is
on
page
43a...
"no
significant
aggravation
of
maggie's
underlying
brain
disorder
was
manifested
within
3
days
following
the
administration
of
the
dpt
vaccine.
"
so
he
made
a
finding
that
there
was
no
significant
aggravation.
