justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
one.
what
was
the
first
symptom?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
they
exclusive?
are
they
recited
to
be
exclusive?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
difference
does
it
here
whether
it's
called
a
symptom
or
anything
else?
as
i
understand
it,
the
finding
below
was
that
there
was
a
pathological
condition
of
the
brain
which
was
evidenced
by
the
small
head
size,
if
you
like,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that
there
was
that
pathological
condition
before
the
vaccine
was
administered,
and
that's
what
needs
to
be
proven,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
look
at
(a)(1)(a).
that's
what
you
say
was
not
adequately
done.
it
requires
a
showing
of
the
matters
required
by
section
300aa(11)(c)(1).
where
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
bottom
of
page
4,
vaccine
injury
table,
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
goes
on,
and
the
first
symptom
or
manifestation
of
the
onset
or
of
the
significant
aggravation
of
any
such
illness,
disability,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
leave
that
out.
that's
central
to
the
case,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
the
debate.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
simply
just
can't
say
that
the
special
master
ignored
that
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
illness
is
not
the
seizure.
surely
the
seizure
is
a
manifestation
of
an
illness,
isn't
it?
is
the
seizure
the
illness?
you
ask
what
his
illness
is,
he
has--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
and
what
this
requires
is
that
the
first
symptom
or
manifestation
of
the
onset
or
of
the
significant
aggravation
of
the
illness
have
occurred
within
the
period
after
the
vaccine--
justice
antonin
scalia
--was
administered.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
the
debate
is
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
the
finder
of
fact
conclude
as
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
surely
that's
a
factual
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
moxley,
may
i
come
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
what
the
finder
of
fact
had
to
say
about
aggravation?
you
referred
us
to
page
27a,
and
footnote
4.
i
have
read
it
now
three
times,
and
i
find
not
a
word
about
aggravation.
it
says
nothing
about
aggravation.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
the
closest
you
can
find
to
a
finding
by
the
special
master
that
this
was
a
significant
aggravation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--page
27a.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
give
me
another
page.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
find
a
mention
of
aggravation
on
page
27.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
why
did
you
cite
that
page
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was
aggravation.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'll
ask
you.
aggravation.
what
did
the--
[laughter]
what
did
the
finder
of
fact
have
to...
you're
contending
this
was
an
aggravation.
where
did
the
finder
of
fact
find
an
aggravation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
what
you're
saying
is,
not
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
at
all,
that
the
finder
of
fact
did
not
find
any
aggravation.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
