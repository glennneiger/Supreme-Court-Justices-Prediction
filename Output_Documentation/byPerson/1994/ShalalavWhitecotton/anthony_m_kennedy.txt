anthony
m.

--well,
let
me
ask
you,
and
perhaps
this
will
bring
you
to
your
second
point,
was
it
the
hearing
examiner's
theory...
is
it
the
government's
theory
that
the
ultimate
condition,
the
encephalopathy,
was
related
to
the
microcephaly?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
the
reason...
or
perhaps
there
are
other
reasons.
is
that
the
reason
that
the
ultimate
condition
is
not
idiopathic?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
are
you
saying
that
you
can
concede
that
the
microcephaly
is
idiopathic,
in
the
sense
that
we
don't
know
what
caused
it,
but
that
you
still
prevail
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
idiopathic
depends
on
the
question
we're
asking,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
medical
profession
use
the
word,
idiopathic,
in
the
same
sense
that
we're
using
it
here,
relative
depending
on
which
question
we're
asking?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
agree,
i
take
it,
that
there
can
be
different
kinds
of
symptoms
evidencing
the
same
cause,
right,
evidencing
the
same
disease.
a
disease
can
have
more
than
one
symptom,
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
suppose
that
a
symptom
of
encephalopathy
occurred
before
the
administration
of
the
vaccine.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
presumption
would
not
be
satisfied
then,
would
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
i
think
that's
what
we're
here
to
argue
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
think
it
would
assist
the
court
if
you
would
argue
that
point,
because
that's
where
you're
in
disagreement
with
the
government,
and
that's
why
the
case
is
here.
