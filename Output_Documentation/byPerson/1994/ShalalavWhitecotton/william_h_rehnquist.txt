we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-372,
donna
e.
shalala
v.
margaret
whitecotton.
mr.
gornstein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
the
term
"first"
somewhat
superfluous
with
the
term
"onset"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
first
doesn't
modify
onset,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
moxley,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
wasn't
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
ruling,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
court
of
appeals...
i
understood
the
court
of
appeals
to
leave
the
findings
of
the
special
master
undisturbed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
defending
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
since
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
virtually
not
at
all
with
the
findings
of
the
special
master,
i
don't
see
why
you
should
concentrate
on
the
findings
of
the
special
master,
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
moxley?

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--of
the
petitioner's
brief,
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
special
master
hear
medical
evidence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
repeat
justice
o'connor's
point,
my
impression
was
the
findings
simply
are
not
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
keep
criticizing
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
on
36a
does
the
special
master
talk
factually
about
aggravation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
special
master
anywhere
make
any
factual
finding
that
there
was
an
aggravation?
yes
or
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
moxley,
we've
been
questioning
you
several
times
about
findings
of
aggravation.
you
answered
me
just
a
moment
ago
that
the
special
master
made
no
finding.
now
justice
ginsburg
points
out
that
he
made
a
very
express
finding.
how
can
you
stand
up
there
at
the
rostrum
and
give
these
totally
inconsistent
answers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
should
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you...
perhaps
you
haven't
confused
us
so
much
as
just
made
us
gravely
wonder,
you
know,
how
well-prepared
you
are
for
this
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gornstein,
you
have
11
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
94-372,
shalala
v.
whitecotton
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
