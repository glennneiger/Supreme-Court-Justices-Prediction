mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
under
the
vaccine
injury
act
and
involves
an
interpretation
of
two
related
provisions.
the
first
creates
a
presumption
that
a
vaccine
has
caused
a
child's
condition
when
the
first
symptom
or
manifestation
of
the
onset
of
that
condition
occurs
within
a
specified
period
after
the
administration
of
a
vaccine.
the
second
permits
the
secretary
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
causation
by
showing
that
the
child's
condition
is
due
to
factors
unrelated
to
the
vaccine.
our
position
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
its
interpretation
of
each
of
these
provisions.
let
me
start
with
the
statutory
presumption
in
section
300aa-11,
which
appears
in
page
2
of
our
brief.
the
court
of
appeals
interpreted
the
requirement
that
the
first
symptom
or
manifestation
of
onset
must
occur
in
the
statutory
period
to
mean
that
a
presumption
of
causation
will
arise
whenever
any
manifestation
of
a
covered
condition
occurs
after
the
administration
of
the
vaccine,
even
if
that
condition
has
already
manifested
itself
beforehand.
so
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
if
a
child
has
very
clear
manifestations
of
a
serious
brain
injury,
and
then
has
the
vaccine,
and
then
another
manifestation
of
the
same
condition,
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
there
will
be
a
presumption
that
the
vaccine
caused
the
onset
of
the
child's
condition,
and
we
think
that
interpretation
is
incorrect
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
use
of
the
statutory
terms,
first,
and
onset.
when
a
condition
has
already
manifested
itself
prior
to
the
administration
of
a
vaccine,
any
manifestation
of
that
same
condition
that
occurs
after
the
administration
of
the
vaccine
cannot
be
first,
and
it
cannot
be
a
manifestation
of
onset.
the
very
first
symptom
or
manifestation
of
onset
necessarily
implied
the
absence
of
any
preexisting
symptom
or
manifestation
of
that
same
condition.
the
second
reason
that
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
its
interpretation
is
that
its
interpretation
fails
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
congress
specifically
addressed
cases
where
conditions
had
already
manifested
themselves
prior
to
the
administration
of
a
vaccine
through
the
significant
aggravation
presumption.
under
section
300aa-11,
there
is
a
separate
presumption
of
causation
when
the
first
symptom
or
manifestation
of
a
significant
aggravation
of
a
preexisting
condition
occurs
within
the
statutory
period.
we
think
the
clear
import
of
that
separate
presumption
is
that
when
a
condition
has
already
manifested
itself
prior
to
the
administration
of
the
vaccine,
a
presumption
that
the
vaccine
has
something
to
do
with
the
child's
condition
can
only
arise
when
that
preexisting
condition
has
gotten
worse
after
the
administration
of
the
vaccine.
so
under
a
simple
and
straightforward
reading
of
the
statutory
language,
the
simple
existence
of
a
symptom
or
manifestation
of
a
covered
condition
in
the
statutory
period
is
never
enough
by
itself
to
trigger
the
presumption
that
the
vaccine
has
caused
the
child's
condition.
in
addition,
it
must
either
be
the
case
that
there's
no
preexisting
symptom
or
manifestation
of
that
condition,
or
the
child's
condition
has
gotten
markedly
worse
afterwards.
by
holding
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
the
existence
of
a
symptom
or
manifestation
of
a
condition
in
the
statutory
period
was
sufficient
by
itself
to
trigger
the
statutory
presumption,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
erred.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
even
if
we
were
just
looking
at
that
table
language,
and
that
appears,
by
the
way,
at
page
4
of
our
brief,
and
says,
"time
period
for
first
symptom
or
manifestation
of
onset
or
of
significant
aggravation
after
vaccine
administration.
"
there
would
be
more
of
a
case,
but
i
still
think
you
would
come
to
the
same
conclusion,
because
the
words
"first"
are
still
used
in
relation
to
the
term
"onset"
and
i
think
when
a
condition
has
manifested
itself
prior
to
vaccine
administration,
anything
that
comes
after
that
cannot
be
the
first
manifestation
of
onset.
even
trying
to
give
some
meaning
to
the
word
"first"
in
the
table
period
is
difficult,
given
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
interpreted
that
phrase,
because
if
congress
had
set
out
to
do
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
done,
it
wouldn't
have
needed
to
use
the
word
"first"
at
all.
it
could
have
just
said,
any
symptom
after
vaccine
administration,
because
any
symptom
is
always
first
in
relation
to
what
came...
comes
after
the
statutory
period.
the
only
real
reason
to
use
the
word
"first"
is
to
make
clear
that
you're
talking
about
first
in
relation
to
what
came
before
the
statutory
period.
but
whatever
ambiguity
you
have
when
you
just
look
at
this
language,
i
think
the
bigger
problem
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
is
that
it
looked
here
at
all,
because
the
purpose
of
the
vaccine
injury
table
is
not
to
set
out
what
the
claimant
is
required
to
show
in
order
to
trigger
the
statutory
presumption.
it's
set
out
to
show
the
time
period
in
which
the
claimant
has
to
make
that
showing.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
think
you
have
the
first
symptom
or
manifestation
of
onset,
or
significant
aggravation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
it...
it
does
modify
onset,
yes,
but
i
think
it's
just
first
symptom
or
manifest...
it's
somewhat
superfluous,
i
would
agree,
but
i
think
it
makes
it
more
clear.
it
describes
a
relationship
between
"first"
and
"onset".
so
i
think
that
that
is
the
basic
mistake,
is
in
looking
to
the
vaccine
injury
table,
because
what...
under
section
300aa-13,
it
tells
you
that
compensation
is
appropriate
when
the
petitioner
has
demonstrated
the
matters
in
300aa-11,
and
300aa-11
is
the
part
of
the
statute
we're
relying
on,
which
is
very
clear,
and
i
believe
even
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
when
you
look
at
300aa-11,
it's
very
clear
that
the
claimant
has
to
show,
in
effect,
the
first
of
all
manifestations.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
you
do
not.
we
have
presented
both
questions
because
we
think
that
in
this
case
one
or
the
other
has
to
be
suffic...
there
are
two
independent
grounds,
and
either
one
will
do.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
we
would
agree
that
those
matters
are
open
on
remand.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
the
first--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
first
symptom
or
manifestation
was
the
abnormally
small
head
size
at
birth,
which
was...
the
special
master
found
was
a
positive
indication
that
this
child
was...
already
had
a
very
serious
brain
injury.
the
second
clear
manifestation
occurred
at
between
3
and
4
months,
and
that
was
the
fact
that
she
fell
further
behind
on
the
growth
chart
in
head
size,
and
so
that
was
also,
the
special
master
said,
a
manifestation
that
she
had
a
preexisting
brain
injury,
serious
brain
injury.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
would
say
it's
not
the
head
size
that's
the
cause,
it
is
the
abnormally
small
brain
that
is
the
cause
of
the
injury,
and
it
is
the
abnormally
small
head
size
that
tells
you
you
have
an
abnormally
small
brain,
and
sometimes
the
term
microcephaly
is
used
to
refer
to
both
of
those
things,
but
what
you
have
is
an
abnormally
small
head
size
that
tells
you
you
have
an
abnormally
small
brain,
and
that's
what
the
special
master
found.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
the
other
side
may
have
a
different
view
on
whether
the
kind
of...
the
head
size
here
was
sufficiently
indicative
of
an
abnormally
small
brain,
the
kind
of
abnormally
small
brain
that
would
result
in
the
conditions,
and
that
was
the
dispute
that
was
had
at
trial.
the
special
master
resolved
that
by
finding
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
that
it
was
so
abnormally
small
as
to
indicate
abnormally
small
brain
that
would
give
rise
to
these
conditions.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
that's
clearly
supportable
in
the
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturb
the
special
master's
findings
on
that,
and
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
i
was
simply
saying
that
that
is
open
on
remand
for
them
to
argue
that
there's
something
wrong
with
that
finding.
we
don't
think
there
is.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
that's
the
factual
dispute,
that
the
head...
they
would
agree,
i
believe,
that
at
some
point
the
head
size
is
so
small
as
to
let
you
know
that
there
is
a
real
problem
and
that
brain
injury
has
already
occurred,
but
they'll
have
to
speak
for
themselves
on
that
issue,
but
i
think
what
they
would
say
is,
it
wasn't
small
enough,
and
that
the
special
master
heard
conflicting
evidence
about
that
and
concluded
that
it
was.
he
also
concluded...
really,
the
main
dispute
was
at
birth,
but
there
was
really
no...
what
was
even
clearer
evidence
is
the
further
fall-off
below
the
second
percentile
that
occurred
between
the
third
and
fourth
month.
even
their
expert
agreed
that
that
was
an
indication
that
some
serious
brain
injury
had
occurred
at
3
months,
no
later
than
3
months.
it
could
have
occurred
at
birth.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes,
that's
right,
that
the
abnormally
small
brain
led
to
the
difficulties
that
this
child
later
experienced
in
life,
including
mental
retardation,
and
cerebral
palsy,
that
these
are,
in
fact,
children
with
microcephaly,
over
90
percent
turn
out
to
have...
are
mentally
retarded.
there's
only
a
small
percentage
that
are
not.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
reason
that
the
ultimate
condition
is
nonidiopathic
is
that
we
take
a
different
view
of
what
that
term
means
than
did
the
court
of
appeals.
we
think
that
what
not
idiopathic
rules
out
is
the
secretary
saying
something
like,
we
know,
we
have
evidence
that
the
vaccine
did
not
cause
the
child's
condition,
but
we
have
no
idea
what
did.
the
court
of
appeals
took
that
one
step
further
back
and
said,
even
if
we
can
identify
a
factor
that
caused
the
child's
condition,
we
then
have
to
go
back
and
show
what
caused
that
factor,
effectively
requiring
a
dual
layer
of
causation.
so
it
wasn't
enough
for
the
government
to
show
that
the
small
brain,
abnormally
small
brain
led
to
the
child's
condition
unless
the
government
can
then
go
back
and
show
what
caused
the
child
to
have
a
small,
abnormally
small
brain
size
in
the
first
place.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
right,
because
i
think
idiopathic
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute
simply...
it
describes
a
situation
where
the
secretary
says,
i
have
no...
the
vaccine
couldn't
have
caused
it.
i
have
no
idea
what
did.
that's
not
this
case.
the
secretary
is
saying,
we
know
what
caused
the
child's
condition.
it
is
the
preexisting
microcephaly,
or
abnormally
small
brain.
we
just
don't
know
what
caused
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
exactly
right,
and
i
think
that
to
resolve
that
ambiguity
i
think
you
should
go
back
to
the
core
language
in
section
300aa-13,
which
says
that
the
secretary...
(b),
that
shows
that
the
secretary
can
rebut
the
presumption
of
causation
by
showing
that
the
child's
condition
is
due
to
factors
unrelated
to
the
administration
of
that
vaccine.
when
you
just
read
that
language,
you
definitely
get
the
sense
that
the
secretary
can
rebut
the
presumption
of
causation
by
showing
an
alternative
cause,
but
nothing
in
that
would
require
the
secretary
to
establish
the
cause
of
the
cause,
and
i
think
when
you
move
down
to
the
later
references
to
idiopathic,
you
should...
and
unknown,
you
should
read
them
in
light
of
that
basic
distinction.
what
must
be
known
is
the
cause,
not
the
cause
of
the
cause,
and
the
purpose
of
this
idiopathic
provision
was
to
clear
up
an
ambiguity
that
would
otherwise
have
existed
if
they
had
just
said,
factors
unrelated
to
the
administration
of
the
vaccine,
because
at
that
point
it
might
have
been
the
case
that
the
secretary
could
have
said,
i
know
the
vaccine
didn't
cause
it.
i
have
evidence
to
prove
it.
i
don't
know
what
did,
but
a
factor
unrelated
did.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
that's
right.
i
can't
say
that's
100
percent
true,
but
i
think
they
would
describe...
they
could
easily
describe
it
either
way,
depending
on
the
question
you're
trying
to
answer.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
as
long
as
you
could
show
that
the
alzheimer's
preexisted
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
administration
of
the
vaccine,
yes,
because--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
right,
and
cancer
would
be
a
good
example.
if
you
had
a
preexisting
cancer,
and
you
knew
that
led
to
certain
brain
problems,
mental
retardation
or
whatever,
even
if
the
cancer
was
idiopathic
in
the
sense
that
we
don't
know
what
caused
the
cancer,
it's
not
idiopathic
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
because
it
is
a
specific
factor
that
the
secretary
is
relying
on
to
explain
the
child's
condition.
the
secretary
would
not
be
saying
in
that
case,
i
have
no
idea
what
caused
this
child's
condition.
the
one
other
reason
that
i
would
give
in
support
of
our
interpretation,
other
than
the
statutory
language
that
i
relied
on,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
is
really
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
compensation
program,
because
by
adding
a
second
layer
of
causation,
they
are
really
requiring
compensation
in
cases
in
which
everyone
would
agree
that
the
vaccine
could
not
have
caused
the
child's
condition
because
something
else
did.
that
is
not
consistent
with
congress'
intent
to
limit
compensation
to
vaccine-related
injuries.
if
the
court
has
nothing
else,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
just
two
ouick
points.
one
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
question
of
significant
aggravation.
it
decided
this
case
as
an
onset
case,
and
that's
clear
from
page
5a
of
our...
to
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
where
they
quote
the
language
from
the
table
that
refers
to
onset.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes,
and
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
special
master
found
that
there
was
no
significant
aggravation.
there
is
a
discussion
of
the
evidence
in
support
of
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
would
say
that
that
wa
part
of
the
analysis.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
their
theory,
and
i--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--his
theory
was
that
the
seizure
was
the
manifestation
of
a
significant
aggravation,
and
the
special
master
addressed
that
and
said
that
it
wasn't
because
the
seizures
were
very
brief
and
transient,
that
after
the
seizures
in
the
table
period,
that
the
child
returned
to
her
prevaccine
neurological
status,
that
she
continued
to
progress
at
the
basically
kind
of
slow
but
sure
pace,
and
that
she
ultimately--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that
is
the
first
seizure
the
child
had,
yes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
two
of
the
three
courts
below
resolved
it,
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
would
say
the
special
master
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
and
that
issue
is
open
on
remand--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
hypothetical.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
okay.
i--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i
think--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i
think
there
has
to
be
medical
evidence
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--to
say
that
that
is
a
manifestation
of
encephalopathy,
and
if
that's
true,
then
the
child
has
not
demonstrated
the
prima
facie
case,
and
then
you
turn
to
the
question
of
significant
aggravation,
and
you
look
to
see
whether
the
seizure
is
a
manifestation
of
something
that,
a
marked
change
in
the
condition
for
the
worse.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
you
could,
but
i'm
not
sure
i
see
what
the
problem
with
that
is,
when
the
statute,
the
terms
of
the
statute
say
that
the
claimant
has
to
show
that
the
first
symptom
or
manifestation
of
encephalopathy
occurred
after
a
vaccine
administration.
and
if
there
is
a
preexisting
manifestation
of
encephalopathy,
and
there
is
medical
evidence
to
that
effect,
it's
just
that
we
don't
know
what
caused
the
encephalopathy,
then
there's
no
presumption,
because
the
natural...
the
natural
implication
of
the
evidence
is
that
the
child
already
had
something,
and
then
the
statute
says
you
look
to
whether
there's
significant
aggravation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
that
what
the
statute
says
is
it
has
to
be
a
manifestation
of
a
significant
aggravation,
which
means--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--a
manifestation
of
a
significant
aggravation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
the...
but
the
significant
aggravation
is
defined--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--if
it
was
a...
if
someone
could
say,
testify,
based
on
that
manifestation,
that
that
was
a
manifestation
of
a
marked
deterioration
in
the
child's
condition,
because
significant
aggravation
is
defined
on
page
6
of
our
brief,
300aa(33)(4),
the
term
significant
aggravation
means
any
change
for
the
worse
in
a
preexisting
condition
which
results
in
markedly
greater
disability,
pain,
or
illness,
accompanied
by
substantial
deterioration
of
health.
so
you
have
to
be
able
to
say
that
that
seizure
was
a
manifestation
of
that.
that
is,
that
it
was
a
manifestation
of
a
change
for
the
worse
in
a
preexisting
condition
which
results
in
markedly
greater
disability,
pain,
or
illness,
and
the
special
master
carefully
examined
that
and
found
that
it
was
not.
seizures
can
be
entirely
benign.
they
can
be
something
that
is
a
manifestation
of
significant
aggravation.
they
can
be
a
manifestation
of
something
in
between
benign
and
significant
aggravation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
on
significant
aggravation?
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
think
it
has
to...
i
would
repeat
my
argument
that
it's
not
enough
for
it
to
be
a
symptom.
it
has
to
be
a
manifestation
or
a
symptom
of
a
significant
aggravation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
right,
and
it
was...
the
special
master
found
it
was
neither
in
this
case.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
sure.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
souter,
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that
description.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
that
as
long...
in
the
first
case,
even
if
you
don't
know
what
caused
it,
if
you
can
say,
this
is
a
manifestation
of
encephalopathy,
and
that
is
the
table
condition
that
the
claimant
is
seeking
compensation
for,
and
the
person
doesn't
know
exactly--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
right.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
that's
the
key,
is
encephalopathy,
because
that's
what
the
table
says
you
can
recover
for,
either
the
onset
of
encephalopathy,
or
a
significant
aggravation
of
encephalopathy.
that's
the
key
condition,
and
so
when
you
go
back
and
say,
what
happened
before
table
time,
the
question
you're
asking
under
the
first
part
of
our
analysis
is,
was
there
a
symptom
or
manifestation
of
encephalopathy,
not
of
head-jerking,
or
anything
else.
it
could
be...
you
get
nowhere
with
head-jerking.
on
the
second
part
of
our
analysis,
if
you
could
show
that
head-jerking
is
some
sort
of
defined
condition
that
causes,
ultimately,
encephalopathy,
then
you
would
win
as
a...
on
a
factor
unrelated,
even
if
the
first
symptom
or
manifestation
of
that
condition
occurred
after
the
administration
of
the
vaccine,
and
that's
the
difference
between
our
two
theories.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
right.
the
special
master
found
that
there
was
not
a
residual
seizure
disorder
because
the...
one
of
the
requirements
is
that
the
effects
last
for
a
period
of
more
than
6
months,
and
the
special
master
found
that
that
was
not
so
with
respect
to
residual
seizure
disorder.
