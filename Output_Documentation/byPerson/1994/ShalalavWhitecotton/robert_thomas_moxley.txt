mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
behalf
of
maggie
whitecotton,
we
are
not
contending
for
a
departure
from
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
nor
are
we
contending
for
a
rule
based
on
a
generous
interpretation
of
the
statute,
nor
are
we
contending
for
an
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
are
contending
for
an
enforcement
of
the
express
language
of
section
300aa-13(a)(2)(a),
found
at
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
which
states
that
the
term
"factors
unrelated
to
the
administration
of
the
vaccine.
"
does
not
include
any
idiopathic,
unknown,
hypothetical,
or
undocumentable
cause,
factor,
injury,
illness,
or
condition.
on
the
subject
of
microcephaly,
we
do
not
believe
that
microcephaly
qualifies
as
a
first
symptom
of
encephalopathy.
microcephaly
is
the
measure
of
the
outside
of
the
head
at
its
largest
point.
it's
not
a
measure
of
the
function
of
the
brain
inside.
any
error
in
measurement
is
always
in
measuring
it
too
small,
because
the
largest
part
of
the
head
is
what
the
doctor
looks
for.
microcephaly
is
not
a
diagnosis.
it
is
not
a
disease
any
more
than
short
stature
is
a
symptom
of
disease.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
correctly
stated,
no
medical
authority
would
consider
it
to
be
a
symptom.
correctly
stated,
a
medical
authority
would
consider
it
to
be
a
finding,
and
to
call
it
a
symptom
is
to
be
sloppy
in
the
use
of
the
language.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
i
cannot
recall,
your
honor,
that
experts
ever
called
it
a
symptom,
as
such.
in
the
context
of
the
statute,
the
statute
prescribes
what
symptoms
of
encephalopathy
are.
the
symptoms
of
encephalopathy
are
set
forth
extensively
in
section
14(b)(3)(a),
the
age
and
qualifications
to
the
interpretation
of
the
vaccine
injury
table,
and
proof
of
an
encephalopathy,
in
table
time
at
least,
or
even
outside
of
table
time,
under
that
statute
is
very
narrow,
and
it
focuses
on
specific
medical
findings
such
as
eeg,
such
as
bulging
fontanel,
it
even
says
that
the
classical
signs
of
a
dpt
reaction
are
compatible
with
but
not
proof
of
an
encephalopathy,
so--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--they
are
not
exclusive,
but
i
don't
believe--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--that
is
correct--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--well,
what
we
believe
this
court
should
do
is
articulate
a
rule
which
will
guide
us
in
our
practice,
and
we
believe
the
enforcement
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
sets
forth
a
sequence
of
analysis
that
must
be
performed.
we
believe
that
what
the
special
master
did
was
skipped
a
step
in
the
sequence.
the
sequence
in
the
statute
is
first,
13(a)(1)(a),
and
then
13(a)(1)(b).
13(a)(1)(a)
first
calls
for
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
has
proven
a
table
case.
in
this
case,
the
proof
of
this
case,
in
the
government's
proof
of
this
case,
the
government
used
the
table
reaction
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
proof
of
the
preexisting
condition,
and
the
special
master
skipped
over
the
table
reaction
to
get
into
the
causation
inquiry
before
the
special
master
made
the
findings
that
give
us
the
benefit
of
the
presumption.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
in
a
very
strong
sense,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
i
agree
that
that
happened,
although
the
special
master
did
violence
to
the
statute,
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
able
to
determine
the
case
in
that...
because
of
that
legal
error.
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
said
what
they
can't
do,
but
we
believe
that
this
court
should
set
forth
a
rule
telling
us
what
they
can
do,
and
we
believe
that
the
proof--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--oh,
very
much
so,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
oh,
i
don't
so
much
focus
on
the
findings,
your
honor,
as
the
process
which
the
special
master
went
through,
and
the
special
master
skipped
over
the
finding
of
the
table
injury.
the
special
master
found,
parenthetically,
as
it
were,
that
technically
the
petitioners
had
put
on
a
table
case.
our
strongest
argument
is
that
the
statute
requires
a
focus
on
the
table
time
injury.
as
implied
by
our
statement
of
the
questions
presented,
we
believe
that
the
secretary
must
prove
through
a
logical
sequence
of
cause
and
effect
that
the
so-called
factor
unrelated
can
be
shown
as
the
cause
of
the
table
injury.
in
this
case,
the
special
master's
analysis
was
whether
or
not
the
so-called
factor
unrelated
was
consistent
with
the
ultimate
outcome.
we
believe
it
would
be
legally
and
logically
inconsistent
to
allow
the
government
to
use
the
same
facts
which
give
rise
to
the
presumption
to
also
defeat
the
presumption,
and
the
government
syllogism
of
causation
in
this
case
was
that
this
child
had
to
have
an
organic
brain
syndrome
because
this
child
had
a
small
head,
and
this
child
had
seizures,
and
this
child
had
cerebral
palsy,
et
cetera.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
11(c)(1)
is
the
statute
found
at
page
4
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
11(c)(1)
merely
sets
forth
the
requirements
of
the
petition
that--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--no,
it...
the
requirements
of
the
petition.
the...
11(c)(1)(c)(i)
says
a
petition
shall
contain
documentation.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
i...
the
statute
is
on
page
3,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
page
2.
page
2
is
section
11.
it
says,
the
petition
shall
contain
documentation
that
the
person
who
suffered
such
injury
sustained
or
had
significantly
aggravated
any
illness
set
forth
in
the
vaccine
injury
table,
and
the
first
symptom
or
manifestation
of
the
onset
or
significant
aggravation
occurred
within
the
time
set
forth
in
the
table.
now,
it's--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--yes.
now--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--well,
the
thing
that...
i
agree,
yes,
your
honor.
the
matter
that
is
central
to
the
case
is
that
what
happened
to
maggie
whitecotton
in
table
time
is
the
onset
of
a
table
condition,
a
residual
seizure
disorder.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
well,
the
special
master--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--the
special
master
found,
your
honor,
that
the
child
technically,
"technically"
satisfied
the
provisions
of
the
table
with
regard
to
a
residual
seizure
disorder.
that
is,
the
child's
first
seizure
occurred
in
table
time.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
that
has
to
be
the
onset
of
a
significant
aggravation.
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
table
injury,
ab
initio,
in
table
time,
has
to
be
something
that
satisfies
the
table.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
the
encephalopathy,
the
acute
encephalopathy--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--was
the
injury,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
yes,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--a
residual
seizure
disorder--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--a
residual
seizure
disorder
is
a
table
injury
and
it
is
a
specific
table
injury,
and
it
is
a
specific
species
of
table
injury,
and
it's
also
the
most
specific
well-known
species
of
vaccine
injury.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
your
honor,
i
believe
the
ca
fed
recognized
that
the
seizure,
under
the
statute,
was
clearly
the
onset,
the
first
onset
of
symptomatic
encephalopathy,
and
i
believe
that's
a
correct
holding.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
the
special
master
did
say
that
the
child
suffered
a
residual
seizure
disorder.
the
special
master
said
that
the
child
doesn't
now
suffer
from
a
residual
seizure
disorder.
what
that
doesn't
take
account
of,
your
honor,
is
the
fact
that
a
residual
seizure
disorder
and
an
encephalopathy
are
overlapping
definitions,
and
the
residual
seizure
disorder
is
in
the
table
to
satisfy
by
itself
the
requirements
of
the
table
to
show
a
table
time
encephalopathy.
the
ca
fed
showed
that
the
child...
held
that
the
child
had
suffered
a
table
time
encephalopathy,
and
i
don't
think
anybody
factually
disputes
that.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
the
special
master
did,
your
honor.
the
special
master
synthesized
his
findings
from
the
literature,
and
we
submit
that
they
are
not
the
type
of
finding
to
be
given
deference
by
an
appellate
court
because
they
are
logically
absurd
on
their
face.
if
90
percent
of
the
children
with
this
head
size
had
seizure
disorders--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--i
agree
that
we're
not
arguing--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--i
understand
that,
your
honor.
our--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--many
manifestations,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
i...
no,
i
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--yes.
the
issue...
the
issue--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--yes,
your
honor.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
an
acute
encephalopathy
occurs
within
table
time.
if
the
child
has
a
preexisting
condition,
the
focus
is
whether
or
not
that
acute
encephalopathy
radically
changes
that
child's
future
prognosis.
if
the
encephalopathy
does
radically
change
that
child's
future
prognosis,
that
child
has
had
a
significant
aggravation.
there
is
no
way
to
trigger
the
significant
aggravation
presumption
other
than
to
have
an
acute
encephalopathy
in
table
time,
and
the
sudden
onset
of
seizures
in
table
time,
and
the
diagnosis
in
the
record
by
the
treating
physicians
of
a
dpt
encephalopathy,
satisfies
that
burden
whether
or
not
the
child
had
a
preexisting
condition.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
i
don't
exactly
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
the
issue
is...
is
whether
or
not
the
disease,
the
alleged
disease
necessarily
includes
the
symptoms.
all
are
in
agreement
that
the
alleged
organic
brain
syndrome
which
allegedly
preexisted
the
table
time
reaction,
all
are
in
agreement
that
the
table
time
reaction
is
not
typical
of
organic
brain
syndrome.
all
are
in
agreement
that
seizures
are
not
typical
of
organic
brain
syndrome.
all
are
in
agreement
that
cerebral
palsy
is
not
necessarily
a
manifestation
of
organic
brain
syndrome.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
i
believe
that...
i
believe
it
gets
back
to
13(a)(2)(a).
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
the
answer
is
that
there
was...
that
microcephaly
is
not
a
disease.
microcephaly
might
be
a
symptom
of
a
disease.
chronic
organic
brain
syndrome
is
not
a
disease,
either.
it
is
an
idiopathic
disorder.
it
is
totally
speculative.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
i
believe
the
government
has.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
i
believe,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--i
don't
believe
that
it
has
to
be
the
first
symptom
in
a
significant
aggravation
case.
the
legislative
intent
has
a
specific...
fact-specific
example
in
it
of
the
aggravation
of
a
seizure
disorder,
and
all
it
requires
is
that
the
seizures
become
more
frequent,
so
the
first--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--that
is
correct
for
what
we
call
an
onset
case,
your
honor,
yes.
i
don't
dispute
that
at
all.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
our
position
is
that
this
case
satisfies
the
table
presumption
for
significant
aggravation.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--well,
it's
both.
our
theory
is
that
we
had
actually
the
first
symptom
of
an
encephalopathy
as
defined
by
the
act
in
table
time
after
the
shot.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
yes.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
the
finder--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--the
finder
of
fact
found
that
we
technically
fit
the
table,
but
that
maybe
congress
did
not
intend
for
the
table
to
be
literally
applied.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
there
is
a
footnote.
one
would
have
to
look
in
the
petition
for
writ,
and
have
to
look
for
the
special
master's
decision.
page
27a
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
the
special
master
found
that
the
child's
condition
satisfied
the
injury
table
but
that
he
did
not
have
to
find
a
table
injury,
and
footnote
4,
he
said
his
conclusion
was
based
on
a
literal
reading.
however,
congress
may
have
intended
something
else.
we
believe
that
we
need
a
rule
that
will
govern
us
in
our
practice.
we
believe
that
we
need
a
rule
which
puts
the
burden
on
the
government
after
we
satisfy
our
burden,
and
does
not
put
a
burden
on
us
to
disprove
the
government's
case
in
the
satisfaction
of
our
burden.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
it
doesn't--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
you
are.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
the
thing
that
would
have
to
be--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--yes,
your
honor.
the
thing
that
would
have
to
be
added
to
your
significant
aggravation
scenario--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--in
order
for
us
to
satisfy
our
case
to
show...
our
burden
to
show
a
table
case
would
be
for
that
seizure
after
the
shot
to
be
the
first
of
weekly
seizures.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
i
believe
so,
yes.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
your
honor,
in
the...
there's
a
legal
standard
there
that's
implicit.
the
office
of
special
masters
has
articulated
a
presumption
of
normalcy
for
the
child
at
the
time
of
the
shot
if
the
child
has
had
no
overt
symptoms
of
encephalopathy,
and
if
you'll
look
at
the
government's
reply
brief,
they
would
put
the
burden
on
us
of
proving
that
the
child
was
normal
at
the
time
of
the
shot,
and
we
believe
that
we
need
an
articulation
of
what
this
statute
means
in
terms
of
what
it
means
to
our
practice,
and
we
believe
that
the
court
should
find
that
this
child
has
the
right
to
be
presumed
to
be
normal
if
she
had
no
symptoms
of
encephalopathy
that
fit
the
statute--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--well,
the
first
symptom
does
not
require
a
showing
that
the
child
was
normal.
the
first
symptom
is
the
first
symptom.
the
seizure
in
this
case
was,
indeed,
the
first
symptom.
there
were
no
symptoms.
microcephaly
is
not
a
symptom.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
the
special
master
went
into
the
question
of
comparing
the
ultimate
condition,
consistency
of
ultimate
conditions.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
that
is
the--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--i
agree.
i--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--i
believe
that
she
was
asking
me
if
i
was...
if
i
could
point
out
whether
or
not
the
court
had
addressed
the
issue
of
a
table
injury,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
i
believe
that--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--the
finder
of
fact
used
the
massoci
test
as
articulated...
as
ostensibly
argued
in
my
brief,
which
was
to
compare
the
ultimate
condition
of
the
speculative...
compare
the
ultimate
condition
to
the
outcome
from
the
speculative
organic
brain
syndrome.
because
the
special
master
focused
on
the
final
outcome
rather
than
on
the
table
injury,
the
special
master
was
able
to
find
that
the
causation
of
the
ultimate
outcome
was
from
the
speculative
hypothetical
preexisting
condition.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
not
at
all,
properly.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
no.
he
addressed
aggravation
at
page
36a--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--of
that

opinion.
mr.

moxley
a
comparison
of
the
condition
prior
to
the
administration
of
the
vaccine
and
an
exercise
of
deciding
whether
or
not
that
condition
was
consistent
with
the
current
condition.
if
you
believe
that
the
child
is
brain-injured
prior
to
the
shot,
there's
a
way
of
saying
that
the
ultimate
condition
is
always
consistent--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--i
don't
believe
the
special
master
did.
i
don't
believe
the
special--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--no.
he
found
that
there
was
no
aggravation.
the
issue
to
us
is
whether
or
not
the
table
condition
itself
is
an
aggravation,
and
the
special
master's
analysis
is
whether
or
not
the
ultimate
condition
is
an
aggravation,
and
we
believe
that
it
strips
us
of
the
statutory
presumption
of
compensability--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--i
agree,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
onset
of
a
residual
seizure
disorder
in

robert

moxley
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
don't
mean--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--i
don't
mean
to
confuse
the
court.
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
your
honor,
it
is
our
assertion
that
the
onset
of
a
residual
seizure
disorder
in
table
time
is
a
significant--
mr.
robert
thomas
moxley
--aggravation
as
a
matter
of
law.
thank
you,
your
honor.
