justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
need
a
rule,
i
mean,
i
thought
this
case
came
here
on
a
slightly
different
theory.
imagine
a
baby
is
born.
on
the
3rd
february
it
has
a
seizure.
on
the
3rd
march,
it
has
another
seizure.
on
the
1st
april
it
gets
some
dpt
vaccine,
and
on
the
3rd,
it
has
a
third
seizure.
in
that
circumstance,
i
thought
the
statute
makes
clear
that
you
have
not...
will
not
be
able
to
recover.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
were
not
able,
in
that
situation,
to
show
what,
i
guess,
the
statute
here
in
11(c)
requires,
that
you
have
to
show
that...
what
are
the
exact
words,
that
the
first
symptom
or
manifestation
of
the
injury
or
the
aggravation
occurred
within
3
days
after
the
dpt
vaccine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
yet
the
fed
circuit
seemed
not
to
do
that
simple
thing.
rather,
they
seemed
to
say
that
even
if
it
were
just
the
case
i
was
describing,
that
that
words
wouldn't
apply.
that's
what
i
thought
the
issue
was
initially,
and
then
that
seems
to
be
mixed
up
with
a
different
issue,
is,
is
this
small
head
size
like
the
prevaccine
seizures
or
not
like
the
prevaccine
seizures?
you're
saying
not,
it
wasn't
a
symptom
or
manifestation,
and
i
guess
initially
the
other
side
said
it
was.
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
not,
explain
why
i'm
not.
am
i...
i
am
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
to
be
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there'd
have
to
be
some
change.
in
the
pure
case
that
i
imagine,
everybody's
in
agreement.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
then
the
question
is,
was
it
somehow
an
aggravation,
a
symptom
of
a
significant
aggravation,
the
first
symptom
of
a
significant
aggravation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
if
so,
the
statute
seems
to
say,
if
it's
the
first
symptom
of
the
significant
aggravation...
that's
what...
the
words
it
uses,
then,
if
you
show
that,
you
prevail,
but
then
what's
the
legal
argument?
they're
saying,
and
as
it
comes
up
here,
it
seems
as
if
there
is
a
finding
that
it
isn't
the
first
symptom
of
a
significant
aggravation.
there
was
a
disease
here
that
preexisted,
and
there
was
no
significant
change.
those
are
fact-findings.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
the
statute
says,
the
statute
says
that
you,
the
petitioner,
have
to
demonstrate
by
a
preponderance
of
evidence
matters
in
the
petition,
in
300aa(11)(c)(1).
one
of
those
matters
is
that
the
first
symptom
or
manifestation
of
the
significant
aggravation
occurred
within
3
days
after
the
dpt
vaccine,
so
it
would
seem
to
say
that
you
have
to
show
that.
so
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
but
mr.
gornstein
i
think
has
raised
a
point
which
he'd
like
guidance
on
in
this,
because
suppose
that
this
child
has
the
seizure
within
3
days
after
the
dpt
vaccine
is
administered,
and
suppose
that
really
is
the
first
seizure,
and
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
so
you
don't
have
to
go
into
a
long
thing
about
causation,
you
don't
have
to
go
into
a
long
thing
about
whether
there
was
some
other,
mysterious
thing
that
caused
it.
well,
you
could,
on
your
interpretation,
have
to
go
into
that
long
thing,
because
if
mysterious
disease
x
that
nobody
knows
about
in
fact
had
caused
something,
arguably,
prior
to
the
administration
of
the
vaccine,
like
a
head-twisting,
or
something,
then
it
would
be
open
to
the
government
to
say,
oh,
you
see,
that
was
really
the
first
symptom,
in
which
case
by
the
back
door
you'd
bring
in
all
these
other
mysterious,
idiopathic
or
whatever,
causes.
i
think...
i'm
not
positive,
but
i
think
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
bothering
him,
and
i
think
that
that's
the
sort
of
thing
he'd
like
an
interpretation
about,
so
what
would
we
say
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
there's
a
mysterious
idiopathic
cause,
some
weird
thing,
and
the
government
wants
to
say,
this
weird
thing
is
the
cause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
they're
forbidden
by
the
statute
to
bring
that
up,
but
they
might
say,
wait
a
minute,
there
was
a
first
symptom.
the
first
symptom
was
a
neck-twisting
or
something--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--even
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
there
is.
there's
a
doctor
who
comes
in
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
could
bring
that
in
even
with
the
weird,
mysterious,
idiopathic
mystery
disease?
you
see,
that's
what's
worrying
him,
the
weird,
idiopathic
mystery
disease
which
had
its
first
symptom,
according
to
dr.
x,
before
the
vaccine
was
administered.
