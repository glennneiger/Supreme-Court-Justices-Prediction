justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
any
question
in
the
record,
just
as
an
evidentiary
matter,
that
the
head
size
can
be
treated
as
a
cause
of
the
brain
injury?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there's
no
question
about
the
evidentiary
basis
for
that
relationship.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
therefore
reverse,
there's
not
going
to
be
a
fight
over
what
the
evidence
shows.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
say
there's
no
question
about
the
evidentiary
basis
for
that
finding.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
your
under...
does
sense
of
idiopathic,
as
you
are
saying
the
statute
uses
it,
broad
enough
to
cover
this
situation:
is
a
condition
idiopathic
when
that
condition
is
part
of
a
recognized
disease,
in
and
of
itself,
although
we
don't
know
what
causes
the
disease?
for
example,
if
you
had
a
vaccine,
one
of
the
symptoms
of
which
is
people
get...
sometimes
get
forgetful
after
a
couple
of
days,
and
someone
with
alzheimer's
disease
had
the
vaccine
and
was
indeed
forgetful.
we
wouldn't
say,
in
effect,
i
suppose,
that
alzheimer's
disease
causes
forgetfulness.
that's
what
we
mean
by
alzheimer's
disease,
so
in
that
case,
if
the
secretary
came
in
with
evidence
there
was
preexisting
alzheimer's
disease,
would
that
be
sufficient
for
rebuttal
under
your
understanding
of
idiopathic?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
nothing
is
idiopathic,
then,
i
guess,
if
it
is
a
condition
which
is
sort
of
a
recognized
set
of
symptoms
or
conditions
within
normal
diagnostic
practice.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
necessary
to
satisfy
the
burden,
but
it's
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
burden,
because
you've
also
got
to
show
that
it
was...
that
these
symptoms
were
the
manifestations,
the
first
manifestations
of
the
onset
of
the
disease,
and
that
in
and
of
itself
doesn't
follow
merely
from
introducing
evidence
that
after
the
vaccination
the
symptoms
occurred.
you've
got
to
introduce
something
else,
haven't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
may
not
be
typical,
but
if
in
fact
the
evidence
is
that
they
were
caused,
and
you
don't
also
introduce
some
evidence
to
the
effect
that
there
was
no
other
manifestation
of
the
disease
prior
to
vaccination,
you
haven't
touched
all
the
bases
required
in
the
statute,
have
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what's
the
answer
to
my
question
first?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no
one
is
claiming
in
this
case
that
microcephaly
is
itself
the
disease.
i
mean,
i...
maybe
i'm
missing
your
point--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
i
don't
think
that
responds
either
to
the
government's
position
or
to
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
the
disease
was
encephalopathy,
and
the
government
is
simply
saying
that...
well,
i...
strike
what
the
government
is
saying.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
make
the
case
that
you
have
to
make
in
the
first
instance,
you
would
have
to
show
not
merely
that
there
was
some
manifestation,
some
symptoms
of
that
following
the
vaccination,
but
that
in
fact
it
was
the
first
symptom,
that
it
was
the
symptom
of
an
onset,
and
if
you
don't
show
that,
you
haven't,
in
fact,
made
out
your
prima
facie
case,
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i--
--mr.
gornstein,
assume...
i'm
sorry.
just...
i
want
to
follow
up
one
point
on
the
aggravation.
supposing
that
it
is
true
that
if
3
days
after...
within
3
days
after
an
aggravation,
the
child
has
the
first
seizure
the
child
has
ever
had,
and
at
that
point
in
time,
that
would
be
one
symptom
of
a
serious
aggravation.
now,
it
may
turn
out,
over...
if
you
look
at
it
a
year
later
that
there
never
was
a
serious
aggravation.
this
would
have
happened
anyway.
but
is
it
not
true
that
looking
at
it
as
of
the
period
48
hours
after
the
vaccination,
the
table
condition
is
satisfied
if
it
is
a
symptom
of
something
that
she
may,
in
fact,
not
have?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
it
has
to
be
a
symptom.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
my
i
try
out
two
alternatives--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
see
if
i
understand
your
position.
assume
justice
breyer's
hypothetical.
the
first
seizure
occurs
whatever
it
was,
a
day
after
the
vaccination.
prior
to
the
vaccination
there
has
been
head-twisting,
neck-twisting
of
some
sort.
the
medical
evidence,
the
government
presents
medical
evidence
in
the
first
case,
the
first
hypothetical,
by
a
doctor
who
says,
in
my
judgment
there
probably
was
a
relationship
between
the
seizure
and
the
preexisting
neck-twisting.
that
is
not
a
standard
syndrome,
but
i
think
that's
what
we're
ultimately
going
to
find,
so
for
that
reason
i
posit
a
cause
of
the
seizure
which
is
not
the
vaccination.
that's
hypothetical
number
1.
hypothetical
number
2,
the
doctor
says,
there
is
in
fact
a
recognized
syndrome
or
condition
in
which
seizures
and
neck-twisting
go
together.
you
get
neck-twisting,
you
know
you're
going
to
get
a
seizure
or
there's
going
to
be
a
high
probability
of
a
seizure
later
on.
this
conjunction
of
symptoms
is
readily
observed
and
understood
as
kind
of
a
standard
diagnostic
category,
and
we
call
that
category
disease
x.
disease
x
has
nothing
to
do
with
vaccinations.
you
would
have
gotten
the
seizure
anyway
because
you
had
the
neck-twisting.
as
i
understand
your
position,
in
the
first
case,
the
claimant
would
have
made
out
at
least
a
case
for
the
presumption.
it
would
not
have
been
affected
by
this
hypothesis
of
an
idiopathic
cause
which
nobody
but
the
doctor
testifying
knows
about.
in
the
second
case,
the
presumption
would
not
apply,
because,
in
fact,
no
reasonable
finder
of
fact
would
conclude,
if
they
accepted
the
doctor
as
telling
the
truth
and
as
a
competent
medical
expert,
no
reasonable
finder
of
fact
would...
in
fact
would
conclude
that
this...
that
the
seizure
was,
in
fact,
a
first
manifestation
of
an
aggravation.
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
well
then,
correct
me
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
mean,
even
if
you
don't
know
what
causes
encephalopathy--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
there
is
always
seizures
that
go
with
encephalopathy--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
you
have
evidence
of
preexisting
encephalopathy.
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
residual
seizure
disorder
point?
i
thought
it
was
decided
by
the
master
that
that
was
not
established.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
as
an
infant,
the
respondent
the
margaret
whitecotton
experienced
symptoms
of
an
injury
to
the
brain
shortly
after
receiving
the
vaccination.
she
subsequently
filed
for
recovery
under
the
national
childhood
vaccine
act,
which
provides
that
a
claimant
establishes
a
prima
facie
entitlement
to
compensation,
when
she
shows
that
the
first
symptom
of
certain
injuries
occurred
within
a
specified
time
period
after
vaccination.
the
special
master
denied
respondent's
claim
finding
that
she
had
experienced
symptoms
of
her
injury
prior
to
receiving
her
vaccine.
the
court
of
federal
claims
affirmed,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
a
claimant
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
whenever
she
shows
that
symptoms
of
her
condition
occurred
within
the
post
vaccination
period,
identified
by
the
statute,
even
if
there
was
evidence
of
her
condition
before
the
vaccination.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
federal
circuit
and
hold
it
under
the
plain
language
of
the
act,
the
demonstration
that
a
claimant
experienced
symptoms
of
an
injury
after
receiving
the
vaccine,
while
necessary,
is
insufficient
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case.
the
claimant
must
also
show
that
the
symptoms
were
her
first
and
hence
that
no
evidence
of
injury
appeared
before
the
vaccination.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer
joins.
