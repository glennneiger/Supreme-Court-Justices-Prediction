mr.
fried,
i
just
don't
think
that's
true,
that
we
only
accord
deference
to
agency
officials
in
their
areas
of
expertise.
we
certainly
accord
deference
to
an
agency
officer
as
to
the
meaning
of
that
agency's
regulation.
now,
that's
a
preeminently
lawyer's
type
question,
what
the
text
of
a
regulation
means.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
being
a...
you
know,
an
expert
about
technical
safety
matters.
it's
just
what
the
meaning
of
the
regulation
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
accord
deference.
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
could
show
that
they
would
automatically
have
the
consequence,
you
wouldn't
have
to
reply
upon
this
regulation
anyway,
because
you
would
show
that
it's
not
negligence
to
have
them.
yes.
if
they
all
have
that
consequence,
it
couldn't
possibly
be
negligence,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
if
you
can't
say
that,
then
you
cannot
say
that
this
regulation
in
effect
prohibits
the
use
of
antilock
brakes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
agency
just...
when
you
say
respected
it,
just
did
the
act
that
it
required,
but
not
for
the
reason
that
it
stated,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
important
to
your
case
to
establish
not
just
that
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
required
the
elimination
of
that
regulation,
but
also
that
it
established
the
reason
for
the
elimination
of
the
regulation,
and
that
just
doesn't
track.
to
find
the
reason
for
it,
we
simply
look
to
the
ninth
circuit
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
the
reason--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
is
the
reason
the
agency
eliminated
it?
nonsense.
the
agency
eliminated
it
because
it
had
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
have
to
say
something
is
true
which
it
believes
is
false.
you
can
comply
with
the
judgment
of
the
court
even
while
thinking
the
court
is
wrong,
can't
you?
i
know
a
lot
of
people
that
lose
here
that
think
that.
[laughter]
and
they
comply
nonetheless.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
i
think
you're
saying
it
doesn't
necessarily.
of
course
not,
but
the
only
reason
to
have
this
provision
is
to
cover
that
element
of
the
common
law
that
does.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
common
law
liability
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
common
law
liability
includes
a
lot
of
things.
it
includes
standards,
it
includes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--procedures,
and
all
sorts
of
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
since
we're
dealing
with
a
statute
that
issues
standards,
this
thing
must
be
addressing
common
law
liability
insofar
as
liability
is
based
on
standards,
otherwise
it's
meaningless.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
like
saying,
compliance
with
the
motor
vehicle
safety
standard
will
not
permit
a
10-person
jury.
it
would
make
no
sense.
it
must
be
addresses
as
standards,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
is
that
an
extreme
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
this
case.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wolfson,
i
gather
from
what
you've
said
that
you
do
take
the...
or,
the
government
does
take
the
extreme
position
that
there
could
be
a
standard
in
effect,
and
nonetheless
an
individual
could
held
liable
at
common
law
for
not
violating
that
standard
for
complying
with
the
standard,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
then
what
do
you
think
the
meaning
of
the
exception
for
the
common
law
is,
for
common
law
liability?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
need
that
for
cases
like
this.
you're
saying
there's
no
standard.
i
assume
that
the
exception
applies
only
when
there's
a
standard.
you're
telling
us
there's
no
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
might
be
ambiguous
on
the
point
of
whether
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
it
is
preempted.
you
say
it
is
preempted
impliedly.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
preempted.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
is,
you
can,
indeed,
be
held
liable
in
tort
for
refusing
to
violate
a
federal
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
you
don't
think
this
provision
has
any
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
cannot
be
common
law
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
i
really
don't
know
what
that
provision
means.
maybe
it
means
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
congress
doesn't
trust
state
regulators.
maybe
congress
thinks
state
regulators
are
too
much
under
the
thumb
of
automobile
manufacturers
or
some
other
lobby
group,
and
therefore
is
unwilling
to
have
its
standards
preempted
by
state
regulators,
but
trusts
the
courts,
and
thinks
that
perhaps
if
a
state
court
as
a
common
law
matter
wants
to
set
aside
a
standard,
that's
another
matter.
that's
a
conceivable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--attitude,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
that
the
manufacturers
who
lost
the
battle
at
the
federal
regulatory
agency
will
simply
go
out
and
fight
it
state-by-state
before
the
state
regulators
and
get
it
reversed,
and
they
didn't
want
that
to
happen,
but
they're
not
worried
about
the
common
law
reversing
it.
