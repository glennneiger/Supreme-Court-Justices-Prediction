suppose...
sorry.
suppose
it
were
just
what
they
say
it
is,
which
i
think
it
isn't,
but
suppose
it
were,
that
the
agency
said,
we've
studied
this
for
4
years.
we're
not
going
to
tell
you
you
can't
have
the
brakes.
we
think
maybe
you
shouldn't.
they're
very
dangerous.
we
regulate
every
aspect
of
this
problem
but
that
because
we
think
they're
so
dangerous,
and
that's
what
they
say,
and
that's
the
rule.
under
those
circumstances,
could
juries
all
over
the
country
say
that
these
things,
which
nhtsa
found
very
dangerous
and
therefore
left
them
out,
say
you
have
to
have
them?
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
that
that
is
this
case,
but
i
think
they'd
like
to
make
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
could
go
forward.
then
why
has
congress
created
an
act
that's
supposed
to
have
safety
as
its
objective
if,
in
fact,
the
agency
specifically
defined
that
this
thing
is
very
dangerous,
nonetheless
the
truckers
all
over
the
country
would
have
to
have
them?
