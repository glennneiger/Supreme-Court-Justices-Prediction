justice
john
paul
stevens
i
still
don't
quite
understand,
mr.
fried,
just
following
up
with...
you
were
interrupted
on...
you
were
going
to
quote
something
that
was
in
writing
that
was
in
place
now,
that
preempts
the
state--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
that
what
you
just
referred
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
it's
just
as
clear
as
if
it
in
so
many
words
said,
you
may
not
use
antilock
brakes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
it's
as
though
the
statute
said,
or
the
regulation,
you
may
not
use
them
if
they
have
this
degrading
consequence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
may
not
use
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
they
in
effect
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
it
say
they
all
have
this
consequence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
about
the
systems
at
issue
in
this
case?
do
they
have
that
consequence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
they
don't
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
you
have
the
driver
response
problem,
wouldn't
that
apply
to
any
system?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
the
plaintiffs
alleged
in
this
case
that
such
a
system
is
now
available,
and
you
were
negligent
not
to
use
it?
why
is
that
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
reserves
that
judgment
to
nhtsa?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
fact
prohibits
any
use
of
antilock
devices
until
we
say
they're
okay--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
devices
that
do
not
function
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they
retain
the
option
to
use
those?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
clear
that
that
excludes
only
those
identified
in
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
let
me...
can
i
just
interrupt?
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
vast
difference
between
a
regulation
that
sets
a
minimum
standard
on
the
one
hand,
and
one
can
say,
well,
that
doesn't
preempt
common
law
liability
for
imposing
an
even
tough
standard
on
the
one,
but
if
you
had
an
express
prohibition
in
a
federal
statute
or
standard
saying
you
can't
use
antilock
brakes--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
a
state
could--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
exactly
what
i
thought
justice
kennedy
gave
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
no,
the
express
prohibition
in
the
federal
statute
saying
you
may
not
use
antilock
brakes.
do
you
think
you
could...
georgia
could
impose
liability
saying
you
were
negligent
because
you
did
not
violate
the
federal
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure
there's
an
inconsistency.
they're
making
a
violation
of...
they're
making
people...
requiring
people
to
violate
federal
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
doesn't
it
apply
in
a
case
of
minimum
standards?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
state
standard,
common
law
standard
could
be
a
little
tougher.
the
antilock
brake
standard
might
require
stopping
in
10
feet,
and
they
might
say,
well,
you're
negligent
unless
it
could
stop
you
in
5
feet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
just
one
question,
mr.
fried.
you
cited
a
case
in
your
first
presentation,
cited
in
one
of
your
opponents
amicus
briefs,
and
i
didn't
get
the
citation.
