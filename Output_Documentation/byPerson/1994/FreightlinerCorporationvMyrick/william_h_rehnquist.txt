we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-286,
freightliner
corporation
v.
ben
myrick.
mr.
fried.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
footnote
8
on
page
9
of
the
respondent's
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
find
this
quite
unsatisfactory,
mr.
fried,
that
things
that
seem
to
be
at
the
core
of
the
case
were
either
lodged
or
are
in
the
footnote
in
someone
else's
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
fried.
mr.
gottesman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gottesman,
strictly
speaking,
that
isn't
the
question
that
we
granted
certiorari
on.
we
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
of
whether,
if
there
is
express
preemption,
there
can
also
be
implied
preemption.
is
it
your
position
that
this
is
one
of
those
anterior
questions
that
has
to
first
be
decided
before
we
get
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
it's
just...
in
that
case,
it
would
be
the
jury
setting
up
a
standard
that
is
totally
in
conflict
with
the
federal
law.
the
federal
law
says,
antilock...
you
must
have
antilock
brakes
or
you
must
not
have
them,
and
the
jury
is
saying
something
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gottesman.
mr.
wolfson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolfson.
mr.
fried,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fried.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
94-286
freightliner
