justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
position,
mr.
fried,
that
if
a
truck
had
airbrakes
on
it,
and
there
was
an
accident,
that
the
federal
standard
could
be
used
or
argued
to
a
jury
as
evidence
that
it
was
unsafe?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
it
didn't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
that
indicates
there's
an
absence
of
a
safety
standard.
the
act
requires
that
there
is
preemption
if
there
is
a
safety
standard
in
place,
but
this
is
an
absence
of
a
standard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
get
to
justice
ginsburg's
point
in
just
a
slightly
different
way.
suppose
the
agency
said,
we
do
not...
we
have
concluded,
after
looking
at
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
that
we
do
not
have
sufficient
information
to
rule
on
this
one
way
or
the
other.
the
matter...
the
estopping
regulation
is
rescinded,
the
distance
regulation
is
rescinded
for
trucks,
and
we
are
going
to
study
the
matter
further.
would
that
be
preemptive
of
the
georgia
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
is
what
we're
interested
in
is
what
the
agency
has
done,
not
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
said,
and
if
the
agency,
in
my
hypothetical,
has
said,
"we
wish
to
study
the
matter
further,
we
do
not
have
information
at
this
time
sufficient
to
make
up
our
mind
one
way
or
the
other.
"
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
see
that
that
is
a
safety
standard
that
preempts
the
georgia
rule,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
very
close
to
what
we
have
and
what
justice
ginsburg
was
getting
at
in
her
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not
a
standard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
the
federal
government
said,
there
may
be
no
antilock
braking
system
on
a
truck,
everyone
would
agree
that
the
state
cannot
have
a
regulation
to
the
contrary,
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
a
jury
find
there
would
be
negligence
for
not
having
the
antibrake
system?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
most
extreme--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
focus
on.
it
says
that
common
law
liability
will
exist,
but
that's
different
from
saying
that
the
state
is
free
to
set
the
standard
for
what
the
negligence
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
common
law
liability
doesn't
necessarily
include
the
formulation
of
the
standard
of
care.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
the
extreme
that
we're
talking
about.
