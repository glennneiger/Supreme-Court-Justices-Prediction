justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
is
with
respect
to
airbrake
systems,
but
it's
not
comprehensive
with
respect
to
the
vehicles
upon
which
an
airbrake
system
may
be
installed.
there's
nothing
comprehensive...
it
is
expressly
noncomprehensive
with
respect
to
them,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
point
that
we
have
to
focus
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
do
so,
but
the
only
word
from
the
national
government
with
respect
to
them,
by
the
national
government's
own
text,
does
not
apply
to
trucks
and
trailers.
i
will
stipulate
to
the
comprehensiveness
of
the
regulation
with
respect
to
those
vehicles
that
it
has
application
to,
but
the
point
that
seems
to
be
dispositive
to
me
is,
it
doesn't
apply
to
these
vehicles,
therefore
there
can't
be
express
preemption,
and
i
would
suppose,
a
fortiori,
there
can't
be
implied
preemption.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
no
matter
how
comprehensive
the
regulation
may
be
with
respect
to
those
vehicles
that
it
covers,
it
is
neither
comprehensive
nor
even,
if
you
will,
in
existence
with
respect
to
those
vehicles
that
it
does
not
cover,
so
i'm
missing
your
point
here.
i
don't
see
the
relevance
of
arguing
the
comprehensiveness
of
what
it
says
when
it
applies
to
the
question
of
whether
it
applies
to
these
trucks
and
trailers,
which
by
its
express
terms,
it
does
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i'm
focusing
on
the
text
of
the
amendment.
what
was
the
text
of
the
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
inserting,
that's
not
this
case.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
suppose
it
would
apply
in
the
case
of
an
expressly
provided
option.
you
may
have
it
or
not
have
it.
an
express
option,
as
distinct
from
an
option
by
silence.
i
suppose
it
would
apply
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
is
slightly
different
from
the
example
you
just
gave,
because
here,
your
position,
i
take
it,
is
what
the
agency
has
done
is
the
equivalent
of
agency
silence.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
expressly
saying
nothing,
if
you
will.
