justice
clarence
thomas
this
is
a
far
less
exciting
case.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
there
are
actually
two
cases
involved
and
these
cases
involved
automobile
collisions
with
tractor
trailers
and
the
accident
injured
one
respondent
and
killed
the
spouse
of
another
respondent.
the
petitioners
here
are
the
manufacturers
of
the
tractor
trailers.
in
these
common
lawsuits
brought
by
respondents,
the
respondents
alleged
that
the
absence
of
an
antilocking
braking
system
or
the
abs
system
in
the
tractor
trailers
constituted
the
negligent
designed
effect.
the
district
court
held
that
respondent’s
claims
were
preempted
by
he
national
traffic
and
motor
vehicle
safety
act
of
1966
and
by
the
national
highway
traffic
safety
administration
standard
(nhtsa)
121.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
tort
lawsuits
were
not
expressly
preempted
under
circuit
precedent
and
that
there
was
no
implied
conflict
between
federal
law
and
state
law.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
§
1392(d)
of
15
of
the
u.
s.
c.
prohibits
the
state
from
establishing
any
motor
vehicle
safety
standard
when
a
federal
standard
is
in
effect
which
regulates
“the
same
aspect
of
performance”.
respondent’s
claims
are
not
preempted
because
there
are
simply
no
federal
standard
currently
enforced
with
regard
to
stopping
distances
or
vehicle
stability
for
trucks
or
trailers.
although
the
government
had
thought
to
regulate
that
aspect
of
performance
with
standard
121
that
regulation
was
vacated
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
1979.
so,
in
essence
what
we
are
saying
is
that
a
standard
that
does
not
exist
cannot
preempt.
state’s
thoughts
remain
free
to
establish
their
own
safety
standards
regarding
truck
stopping
distances
and
abs
devices.
justice
scalia
concurs
in
the
judgment.
