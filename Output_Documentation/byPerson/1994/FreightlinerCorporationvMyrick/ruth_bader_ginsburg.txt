mr.
fried,
why
shouldn't
we
accept
the
administrator's
determination
of
what
the
status
of
regulation
is?
if
your
reading
is
plausible,
and
their
reading
is
plausible,
and
they
are
telling
us
that
the
expert
administrator
says,
in
effect,
there
is
no
federal
standard,
why
don't
we
owe
that
position
deference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
fried,
suppose
one
were
to
read
this
as
the
agency's
responding
not
to
its
own
better
judgment,
but
to
the
compulsion
of
the
ninth
circuit?
forgetting
about
the
deference
point
that
i
raised
earlier,
why
isn't
the
most
reasonable
reading
of
what
happened
here
is
that
the
agency
is
now
in
the
position
of
saying,
well,
we're
not
yet
ready
to
promulgate
a
final
rule
on
this
point
because
the
ninth
circuit
says
we
have
to
do
a
little
more
work?
why
isn't
that
the
most
reasonable
reading,
that
they
have
suspended
their
judgment.
they
have
not
made
a
judgment
that
this
is
unsafe,
or
that
there
should
be
an
option,
as
they
made
in
the
case
of
the
airbag/seatbelt
regulation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
mr.
fried,
you
concede
that
if
all
we
ever
had
here
was
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
of
the
part
of
121
that
the
ninth
circuit
rejected,
if
all
we
ever
had
was
that,
and
the
agency
never
made
it
a
rule,
then
there
would
be
no
argument
about
preemption,
that
the
states
could
have
their
tort
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
everything
really
hinges...
your
argument
hinges
on
the
respect
that
we
owe
to
that
ninth
circuit
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
it
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
mr.
gottesman,
on
the
case
that's
not
this
case,
wouldn't
it
be
a
powerful,
strong
defense
on
the
part
of
the
manufacturer
to
say,
we
had
to
have
this
device
under
federal
compulsion?
