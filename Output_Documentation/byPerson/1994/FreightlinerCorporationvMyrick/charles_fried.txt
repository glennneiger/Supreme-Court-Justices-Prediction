mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
these
two
consolidated
cases,
the
eleventh
circuit
overruled
its
own
prior
decision
in
taylor
v.
general
motors,
an
airbags
case,
to
hold
that
conflict
preemption
may
not
be
implied
under
the
safety
act.
thereby,
it
reversed
grants
of
summary
judgment
in
two
district
courts
below
and
allowed
the
plaintiffs,
the
respondents
here,
to
claim
that
under
georgia
tort
law
it
may
be
claimed
to
be
a
design
defect
for
manufacturers
not
to
incorporate
antilock
devices
in
their
airbrake
systems.
though
the
first,
third,
and
tenth
circuits,
like
the
eleventh
circuit,
had
held
previously
that
conflict
preemption
may
be
implied
under
the
safety
act,
the
eleventh
circuit
believed
that
this
court's
decision
in
cipollone
v.
liggett
group
required
a
different
rule
because
there
had
been
express
attention
to
the
subject
of
preemption
in
the
act,
thereby
virtually
foreclosing
any
further
inquiry
into
implied
or
conflict
preemption.
we
believe
that
is
wrong,
and
that
express
preemption
does
not
virtually
foreclose
inquiry
into
implied
preemption.
we
also
believe
that
it
is
wrong
to
say
that
section
39...
1397
saves
inconsistent
state
law,
including
tort
law.
before
explaining
why
there
is
indeed
an
incompatibility
here
between
allowing
a
georgia
jury
to
find
a
design
defect
and
the
safety
act,
i'd
like
to
say
just
one
very
brief
word
about
why
the
eleventh
circuit
rule
is
surely
incorrect.
if
that
rule
were
correct,
then
it
would
compel
congress,
every
time
it
legislates,
to
add
a
"we
mean
it"
clause,
a
clause
which
says,
and,
of
course,
we
preempt
all
inconsistent
and
incompatible
state
law.
such
a
boilerplate
clause
would
add
nothing
to
the
supremacy
clause,
nor
would
it
subtract
anything
from
the
burdens
on
this
court,
the
task
of
this
court,
in
determining
what
state
laws
are
and
are
not
incompatible.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
there--
mr.
charles
fried
--that
is
the
contention
principally
urged
by
the
solicitor
general,
and
we
believe
that
is
incorrect.
the
case
which
most
compelling
is
brought
to
mind
was
actually
cited
by
respondents'
amici
atla.
that's
the
ilsa
petroleum
case,
in
which
this
court
said
that
a
preempted
inference
is
not
to
be
drawn
by
inaction
alone,
to
be
sure,
but
from
inaction
joined
with
action,
and
what
i'd
like
to
do
is
indicate
to
you
that
there
was
in
this
case
both
action
and
inaction,
and
that
those
two
together
in
fact
constitute
a
federal
determination
that
it
is
dangerous...
not
simply
unwarranted,
but
dangerous,
or
potentially
dangerous,
to
require
the
incorporation
of
antilock
brakes
in...
antilock
devices
in
airbrake
systems.
mr.
charles
fried
there
would
not.
that
would
not,
but
that--
mr.
charles
fried
--no.
we
rely
on
the
history,
but
also
on
the
text
of
the
present
standard
121.
it's
the
solicitor
general
who
asks
us
to
read
121
as
if
the
subject
of
antilock
devices
had
not
been
addressed,
but
that
is
simply
wrong.
the
subject
is
addressed.
it's
addressed
in
two
places
in
the
present
standard.
it
is
addressed
first--
mr.
charles
fried
--the
administrator
is
owed
deference
because
of
the
administrator's
expertise.
the
administrator
has
expertise
in
safety
matters.
that
expertise
led
the
administrator
to
conclude
in
1978
and
before,
that
it
is
safe
and
required...
and
appropriate
to
require
antilock
devices.
that
judgment
was
reversed.
that
judgment
was
rejected
by
the
courts,
and
certiorari
was
granted
here.
i
believe
that
at
that
point
any
deference
due
to
the
administrator
was
exhausted.
the
administrator--
mr.
charles
fried
--well--
mr.
charles
fried
--on
that,
let's
turn
to
the
meaning
of
the
regulation,
because
there
is...
if
there
is
deference
to
be
paid,
i
think
that
deference
cannot
carry
all
the
way
to
the
conclusion
which
respondents
and
the
solicitor
general
seek,
because
in
this
case
there
was
a
federally
mandated
process,
and
the
outcome
of
that
process
was
the
removal,
and
that
removal
is
textual.
it's
not
just
a
hole.
it's
not
just
like
the
air
in
the
souffle.
it's
there.
it's
on
page...
i
don't
have
the
page,
but
it's
s3
of
the
regulation.
it
says--
mr.
charles
fried
--in
the
lodging,
your
honor.
it's
not...
it
was
subsequently
lodged
with
the
court
to...
it's
referred
to
in
the
briefs,
but
the
actual
regulation
we
lodged
subsequently
with
the
court,
on
page
377
of
that
lodging,
but
it
simply
says,
and
it
is
quoted
in
all
the
briefs,
that
notwithstanding
the
provisions
which
in
effect,
to
use
the
solicitor
general's
phrase,
in
effect
impose
an
antilock
device
requirement,
notwithstanding
it,
that
requirement
is
removed.
so
that's
there,
in
the
text.
now,
there
is
further
addressing
of
anti--
mr.
charles
fried
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
fried
no.
i'm
going
to
refer
to
another
provision
as
well,
which
i'm
frank
to
say
we
didn't
focus
on
until
late
in
the
game,
but
the
respondents
cite
it
on
page
9,
footnote
8
of
their
briefs,
and
that
is
standard
s5.5.1
on
page
383
of
the
lodging.
now,
that
standard--
mr.
charles
fried
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
i
hope
i've
got
the...
yes,
that's
right.
that
refers
to
s5.5.1,
and
what
that
standard
says
is
that
if
you
are
going
to
put
antilock
devices
in
your
airbrake
systems,
then
they
may
not
degrade
the
total
performance
of
the
system.
mr.
charles
fried
i
wish
it
had
been
otherwise,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
fried
it
could
be
used
if
it
violated
5.5.1
as
set
out
by
the
respondents.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
device--
mr.
charles
fried
--oh,
if
it
did
not,
then
that,
too,
would
be
preempted.
just
like
georgia
cannot
say
it
is
a
design
defect
not
to
incorporate
antilock
devices,
even
though
the
basis
of
the
federal
determination
was
that
it
is
dangerous
to
have
such
a
requirement,
so
florida,
let's
say,
to
give
an
example,
could
not
say
it
is
a
design
defect
for
manufacturers
to
incorporate
properly
functioning
antilock
devices
which
nevertheless,
because
of
driver
error
or
maintenance
problems,
which
are
the
two
things
that
plague
these
devices,
has
led
to
an
accident.
either
way--
mr.
charles
fried
--there
is...
standard
121,
altogether,
is
a
comprehensive
design
and
performance
standard.
it
is
not
just
a
performance
standard.
it
has
many
elements
of
design,
and
altogether
it
says
what
constitutes
minimally
acceptable
airbrake
systems.
mr.
charles
fried
an
antilock
device
becomes
part
of
an
airbrake
system.
it
is
integral
to
the
airbrake
system.
it
isn't--
mr.
charles
fried
--oh,
the
difficulties
that
are
being
raised
apply
as
well
to
implied
preemption,
that
is
correct,
but
what
one
has
to
do
is
consider
what
the
federal
government
has
done
and
why
it
has
done
it.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
it
does
apply
to
all
trucks
and
trailers,
including
those
that
incorporate
antilock
devices,
because
those
antilock
devices
cannot,
if
they're
functioning
properly,
bring...
the
malfunctions
in
them,
rather
than
maintenance
and
driver
mistakes,
cannot
bring
the
performance
of
the
rest
of
the
system
below
the
prescribed
minimum.
so
it
addresses
that.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
the
provision
i've
been
citing
to
you
is
in
the
standard
as
it
is
now
in
operation,
and
the
amendment
withdrew
the
requirement
of
having
that
device
in
all
airbrakes.
now,
it
seems
to
me
important
to
ask,
why
did
it
withdraw
that
requirement,
if
the
reason
it
was
withdrawn
has
to
do
with
the
safety
concerns
of
the
act,
not
a
concern
for
uniformity,
not
a
concern
simply
that
the
agency
hadn't
done
it's
knitting
right,
hadn't
produced
the
right
evidence,
but
because
the
record
compelled
the
conclusion
that
this
requirement,
as
a
requirement,
is
dangerous.
mr.
charles
fried
justice
ginsburg,
you're
quite
right,
the
agency
did
not
in
its
heart
of
hearts,
expressed
in
its
own
news
releases,
accept
the
ninth
circuit's
determination.
they
said,
the
administrator
said,
we
still
think
we're
right,
but
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
this
thing
which
you
still
think
is
right
is
not
just
unwarranted,
it
is
dangerous.
mr.
charles
fried
it
would
be
because
the
premise
was
not...
and
this
is
what
i
have
to
keep
coming
back
to.
the
premise
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
was
not,
"look,
you
don't
have
a
sufficient
basis
for
imposing
this
requirement.
"
rather,
they
went
further.
they
say,
"imposing
this
requirement
is
dangerous".
if
they
had
said,
imposing--
mr.
charles
fried
--again,
that
formulation
assumes
that
the
decision
forced
on
a
reluctant
agency
was
a
decision
that
what
you've
done
here
is
simply
not
sufficiently
justified,
rather
than
a
decision
which
was
at
the
heart
of
the
safety
concerns...
that
is
to
say,
what
you
have
done
here
is
dangerous,
and
the
agency,
of
course,
has
had
the
matter
under
continual
review
ever
since.
congress
has
urged
it,
in
both
1988
and
1991,
to
hurry
up
its
review.
in
1992,
they
issued
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking,
but
the
agency
record
and
the
agency
materials
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
over
and
over
again
state
that
there
are
still
grave
problems
about
these
devices,
and
these
problems
are
not
the
problems
of
cost.
mr.
charles
fried
what
is
a
standard
is
121
as
a
whole,
and
121
as
a
whole
tells
you
what
are
minimally
safe
airbrake
systems,
and
those
minimally
safe
airbrake
systems
do
not,
cannot
be
compelled
to
include
antilock
devices
because
it
is
dangerous.
that
is
our
view
of
what
the
standard
is
at
this
moment.
mr.
charles
fried
oh,
no,
they
do
say
you
may
use
them.
mr.
charles
fried
you
may
use
them
if,
when
properly
functioning,
they
don't
degrade
the
rest
of
the
system.
you
may
use
them.
there
are
three
kinds
of
problems
that
were
experienced
with
the
antilock
devices.
one
problem
was
electrical
failures.
for
instance,
you'd
pass
a
radar,
and
the
radar
would
cause
this
device,
which
is
an
electrical
device,
to
put
on
the
antilock
brake
when
you
don't
want
it,
or
perhaps
to
remove
it.
the
second
kind
of
failure
was
maintenance
problems.
the
third
was
driver
reactions,
the
same
problem
which
caused
the
administrator
just
recently
to
withdraw
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
on
automobile
antilock
brakes.
now--
mr.
charles
fried
--if
they
have
this
degrading
consequence--
mr.
charles
fried
--you...
i
believe
that--
mr.
charles
fried
--oh,
well
they...
it's
not
as
if.
it
says
that
in
so
many
words.
mr.
charles
fried
no,
they
don't.
they
say,
if
they
do.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
there
are
no...
these
trucks,
which
were
manufactured--
mr.
charles
fried
--they
don't
have...
they
do
not
have
the
devices.
the
point
that
i'm
making--
mr.
charles
fried
--oh,
we
don't...
we
could
not
say
that
they
do
all
have
that
consequence.
mr.
charles
fried
i
mentioned
the
three
kinds
of
difficulties,
because
5.5.1
addresses
only
the
first.
the
maintenance
problems
and
the
driver
response
problems,
which
are
grave,
and
which
the
agency
in
its
technical
reports
continuously
refers
to,
those
persist,
and
when
i
answered
justice--
mr.
charles
fried
--no.
it's
possible
that
one
day
there
will
be
a
system
design
such
that
drivers
will
respond
properly.
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
preempted
because
the
judgment
that
those
systems
are
now
available
is
a
judgment
which
we
believe
is
reserved
to
nhtsa,
the
correct
place
to
make--
mr.
charles
fried
--121
as
a
whole
reserves
that
judgment
to
nhtsa.
mr.
charles
fried
no.
mr.
charles
fried
leaves
the
option
open,
and
forbids
either
georgia
or
florida
to
impose
design-defect
liability
for
having
them
or
not
having
them.
that
it
retain...
in
other
words,
you
retain
the
option.
the
manufacturers
retain
the
option
to
put
well
functioning
devices
on
their
trucks.
mr.
charles
fried
those
are--
mr.
charles
fried
--no,
they
are
not.
those
are
explicitly
excluded,
as
respondents
point
out,
by
5.5.1.
mr.
charles
fried
electrical
failure.
it
says,
electrical
failure,
so
maintenance
problems,
driver...
inappropriate
driver
response
can't
be
called
electrical
failure,
that's
correct,
and
so
it's
the
actual
functioning
of
the
thing,
since
it
is
indeed
an
electrical
device.
mr.
charles
fried
they
would
not,
because
there
would
not
have
been
any
occasion
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
reach
a
conclusion
on
the
record
as
part
of
the
mandated
process
under
the
act
that
such
a
requirement
is
a
dangerous
requirement
with
which--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
believe
it
hinges
more
on
the
respect
that
the
agency
owed
to
that
ninth
circuit
judgment.
the
agency
has
to
operate
lawfully,
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
it
would
be
unlawful
because
it's
dangerous
to
require
this,
and
the
agency
reluctantly,
to
be
sure,
respected
that
judgment.
it
had
no
choice.
so
i
say
yes,
it
is
the
agency
to
which
we
point,
a
reluctant
agency,
but
the
agency
nonetheless.
mr.
charles
fried
and
that
reason
is
that
this
requirement--
mr.
charles
fried
--is
dangerous.
mr.
charles
fried
but
the
agency
is
a
law-abiding
agency,
and
therefore
it
must
act
pursuant
to
a
judgment
of
a
court
of
law.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
it
is
quite
interesting
on
this
score
that
the
agency
consistently
has
been
unable,
and
in
its
technical
reports,
has
been
unable
to
show
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
fried
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
entirely
correct
that
we
sort
certiorari
in
this
court
on
the
eleventh
circuit's
rule
about
implied
preemption
and
that
was
the
only
matter
as
to
which
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
circuits.
now,
the
brief
in
opposition
raises
the
26
simply
by
a
casual...
or
i...
drop
the
casual,
simply
by
the
statement
that
since
the
federal
regulations
did
not
forbid
antilock
devices,
there
can
be
no
conflict.
of
course,
that's
not
our
position.
it
was
not
the
position
of
the
dissenting
judge,
it
was
not
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
found
there
was
a
conflict,
or
the
district
courts.
nevertheless,
this
is
not
a
case
like
the
one
you
handed
down
yesterday.
this
is
not
one
governed
by
your
rule
14.1,
which
deals
with
the
cert
position.
it's
15.1
and,
of
course,
the
court
is
entirely
free
to
proceed
to
the
no-conflict
point
if
it
chooses.
now,
it's
important
to
see
that
the
courts,
the
three
courts
below
did
decide
this
in
terms
of
implied
preemption,
and
did
indeed
find
a
conflict.
the
implied
preemption
perhaps
has
some
more
force
to
it
than
the
express
preemption,
because
the
conflict
is
with
what
we
insist
is
a
total
federal
determination,
and
that
is
how
this
court
had
looked
at
the
ilsa
petroleum
case
although
reaching
a
difference
conclusion,
but
by
language,
which
supports
us
and
the
atlantic
richfield
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
as
well.
finally,
i
should
point
out
that
it's
not
quite
accurate
to
say
that
nhtsa
has
said
we're
not
ready
yet,
not
quite
yet,
but
everybody
has
these.
in
these...
these
trucks
were
manufactured
in
'82
and
'87.
they
only
began
to
be
offered
as...
antilock
devices
only
began
to
be
offered
as
options
after
the
later
truck
was
manufactured,
and
presumably
because
the
manufacturers
did
not
believe
they
could
comply
until
then
with
5.5.1,
and
what's
important
to
see
is
that
nhtsa
has
continuously,
at
the
highest
levels,
sought
to
impose
this
requirement
and
continuously
been
compelled
by
its
own
technical
people
in
reports
which
we
cite
to
you
to
say
that
the
evidence
shows
that
the
problems
have
not
yet
been
solved.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
charles
fried
ilsa
petroleum.
it's
cited
in
the
atla
brief.
that's
the
case
in
which
the
court
spoke
of
the
preemptive
smile
cannot
be
there
if
there
is
no
cat
left,
but
we
say
there's
a
cat.
thank
you,
your
honor.
