mr.
fried,
even
if
we
accept
your
position
on
that,
we
have
here
an
express
preemption
clause,
as
i
understand
it,
and
it
preempts
state
standards
applicable
to
a
particular
aspect
of
performance
addressed
by
a
federal
standard
that
is
in
effect,
and
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
federal
standard
in
effect
now
on
antilock
brakes,
and
how
can
there
be
express
preemption?
how
do
we
even
get
that
far?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
just
isn't
a
federal
standard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fried--
--well,
if
the
federal
government
had
never
had
any
regulation
in
effect
at
all
dealing
with
antilock
brakes,
would
there
be
any
reason
to
think
the
express
preemption
clause
is
invoked
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
rely
on
the
history
of
what
happened,
i
gather.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
if
there
were
a
federal
performance
standard
applicable
here,
is
it
your
position
that
the
savings
clause
would
still
preserve
this
cause
of
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
i
could
find
some.
