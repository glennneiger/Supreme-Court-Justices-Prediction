mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
it
may
be
well
to
recall
what
this
lawsuit
in
georgia
alleges.
it
alleges
that
these
two
trucks,
the
trucks
that...
one
truck
that
killed
mrs.
lindsey,
the
other
that
maimed
mr.
myrick,
these
two
trucks
were
not
designed
as
safely
as
they
might
have
been,
and
it
alleges
that
by
the
time
these
two
trucks
were
manufactured,
which
was
many,
many
years
after
the
record
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
reviewing,
7
years
in
the
case
of
one
truck
and
12
years
in
the
case
of
the
other,
that
at
that
time
there
were
available
safe
antilock
brakes,
and
that
those
brakes
would
have
been
safer
than
the
brake
system
that
was
chosen.
now,
at
the
core
of
this
case,
and
i
think
it
is
reflected
by
the
discussion
so
far,
is
the
question
of
whether
there
is
any
federal
determination
with
which
this
lawsuit,
if
it
were
won
by
the
plaintiffs,
would
conflict,
and
recall,
the
plaintiffs
haven't
won
this
lawsuit
yet.
they
are
going
to
have
to
prove
that
in
fact
by
1982
or
1987
there
were,
in
fact,
safety
devices
that
would
have
made
this
truck
safer
with
an
antilock
device.
so
the
preemption
issue
has
to
be
considered
on
the
hypothesis
that
such
evidence
could
be
presented.
if
it's
not,
the
georgia
courts
are
obviously
not
going
to
find
for
the
plaintiffs,
and
so
we
focus
on
that
question
first.
now,
the
jumping
off
point
is
a
proposition
that
all
the
parties
here,
including
the
united
states,
agree
on,
and
i'll
give
you
the
petitioner's
formulation
of
that
point,
because
i
think
it's
one
that
we
all
agree
on.
conflict
preemption
could
not
exist,
of
course,
where
there
was
no
federal
determination
on
the
specific
subject,
so
that's
the
petitioner's
formulation
of
what's
involved
here.
and
so
the
question
we
have
is
whether
there
is
a
federal
determination
on
the
specific
subject
of
whether
antilock
brakes
are
unsafe
in
cars.
now,
there
once
was
a
specific
judgment.
obviously,
the
initial
regulation
by
the
agency
said,
you
must
have
them,
because
we
believe
they
are
safer.
plainly,
if
that
regulation
had
remained
in
effect,
this
lawsuit
would
not
be
preempted.
it
would
be
entirely
consistent
with
the
federal
regulation.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we
do,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
question
presented
necessarily
subsumes
that.
it
says,
whether
the
act
preempts
state
common
law
standards
that
conflict
with
federal
standards.
implicit
is
that
in
the
point
that
they
have
to,
as
part
of
that,
demonstrate
that
there
is
a
conflict.
in
the
brief
in
opposition
at
page
26,
we
expressly
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
it
is
our
contention
that
there
is
no
conflict,
and
the
proposition
made
on
that
point
was
made
actually
more
broadly
in
the
brief
in
opposition.
beginning
on
page
21
is
the
caption,
"respondent's
common
law
claims
do
not
conflict
with
the
safety
act,
nor
with
standard
121.
"
and
on
page
26,
the
precise
point
that
we're
making
here
is
made.
that
is,
that
the
present
status
of
the
federal
regulations
is
that
they
don't
preclude
antilock
brakes,
but
they
impose
no
requirement
one
way
or
the
other,
that
in
that
context,
there
is
no
conflict
if
georgia
says
well,
we
encourage
you,
or
at
least
we
will
award
tort
damages
against
you,
if
you
don't
have
them.
so
the
issue
is
properly
preserved.
it
is
a
ground
that
would
sustain
the
decision
below,
and
i
think
really
this
point
is
also
the
point
that
goes
to
the
question
of
express
preemption.
i
think
the
two
are
really
the
same,
and
that
is,
whether
there
is,
in
fact,
a
conflict
between
what
the
state
is
doing
and
what
the
federal
regulations
say.
is
there
a
federal
regulation
in
effect
that
would
be...
would
comprehend
the
point
that
the
georgia
courts
are
being
asked
to
decide
in
this
case?
and
the
regulation
as
it
presently
stands
says
that
as
to
the
aspects
of
performance
which
are
involved
here,
the
ability
of
a
truck
to
stop
within
a
certain
distance
at
a
certain
speed,
and
the
ability
to
do
so
without
jackknifing
or
skidding,
what
is
sometimes
called
vehicle
stability,
as
to
those
aspects,
those
were
dealt
with
in
the
original
regulation,
and
each
of
the
provisions
that
dealt
with
those
aspects
of
performance
is
now
declared
not
to
be
applicable
to
trucks
and
trailers,
so
the
present
state
of
the
regulatory
record
is
that
there
is
no
regulation
that
deals
with
those
aspects
of
performance
of
trucks,
the
ones
which
the
ninth
circuit
said
effectively
required
antilock
brakes.
now,
the
petitioners
say,
well,
but
that
gives
us
an
option.
well,
of
course
it
does.
whenever
there's
no
regulation
in
effect,
they...
the
government
has
chosen
not
to
regulate
something,
they
enjoy
the
options
that
all
citizens
do,
to
do
whatever
is
not
regulated,
but
that
hardly
constitutes
a
federal
interest
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
preempt,
or
that
it
did
preempt
on
the
face
of
this
statute.
now,
petitioner's
argument
ultimately
depends
on
its
trying
to
infuse
the
statement,
there
is
no
regulation
applicable
to
trucks
and
trailers,
with
the
ninth
circuit's
reasons
for
requiring
that
they
suspend
their
earlier
regulation.
now,
the
first
proposition,
of
course,
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
doesn't
have
the
power
to
preempt,
only
the
agency
does,
and
the
agency
has
said
there's
no
regulation
in
effect
applicable
to
trucks
and
trailers,
but
the
second
point
is,
this
is
an
overreading
in
any
event
of
what
the
ninth
circuit
said.
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
it
was
convinced
from
the
record
that
antilock
brakes
promised
greater
safety
in
trucks,
and
it
said
to
a
large
degree,
these
devices
were
already
perfected.
it
said,
but
there
were
some
trucks,
a
substantial
number,
for
which
it
was
a
potential
hazard,
and
it
said
the
reason
this
regulation,
which
required
all
trucks
to
have
safety
devices,
was...
had
to
be
suspended
is
because
it
did
not
distinguish
between
those
on
which
it
was
safe
and
those
that
were
not.
you
can't
have
a
regulation,
said
the
ninth
circuit,
requiring
that
all
trucks
have
antilock
brakes
if
some
trucks
would
be
potentially
dangerous.
there
had
not
actually
been
any
injury
with
these,
but
there
was
the
"potential"
because
some
manufacturers
were
saying,
"we're
having
problems".
and
again,
from
petitioners'
brief,
they
say,
uniform
requirements
on
all
trucks
in
all
their
variety
of
configurations
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
condemned.
you
can't
have
a
uniform
blanket
requirement.
so
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
say
that
antilocks
are
unsafe
on
all
trucks.
it
said,
they're
unsafe
on
some
trucks,
and
some
trucks
based
on
a
record
that
was
made
in
1975,
long
before
these
trucks
were
manufactured.
now,
our
lawsuit
is
not
seeking
a
determination
that
all
trucks
must
have
antilocks.
our
lawsuit
contends
that
these
two
trucks
would
have
been
safer
if
they
had
antilocks.
we
have
to
prove
that.
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
is
not
at
all
inconsistent
with
our
proving
that.
first
of
all,
they
recognized
even
then
that
many
trucks
would
be
safe
with
antilocks.
secondly,
this
is
7
and
12
years
later,
and
as
everybody's
briefs
point
out,
there
has
been
what
is
called
a
second
generation
of
antilock
devices
which
are
safe.
there
has
been
a
huge
increase
in
the
actual
usage
by
manufacturers
of
antilock
devices,
even
though
they're
not
required
to
do
so
by
the
present
regulation,
and
so
nothing
in
the
ninth
circuit,
even
if
you
were
to
read
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
as
though
it,
in
heightened
verbal,
appeared
here
as
an
explanation
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
regulation.
that
would
suggest
nothing
that
says
the
ninth
circuit
has
any
disposition
not
to
recognize
this
lawsuit,
or
to
find
it
inconsistent
with
the
federal
interest,
and,
of
course,
the
interested
agencies
are
here.
the
interested
agency,
i
should
say,
nhtsa,
is
here,
telling
you
that
there
is
no
impeding
of
any
kind.
there's
no
express
preemption,
there's
no
implied
preemption
in
this
case,
because
there
is
no
federal
interest
with
which
this
collides,
and
there
is
no
regulation
on
this
aspect
of
performance.
we
withdrew
it.
now,
petitioner
says,
but
there's
some
other
provision
that
says,
if
you
choose
antilock
brakes,
then
you
must
have
them
conform
electrically
to
what's
required,
so
they
say,
see,
there
is
some
regulation
of
antilock
brakes
in
this
case.
but
the
preemption
provision
of
this
statute
doesn't
say,
if
they
regulate
that
item
of
equipment
the
states
can't
act.
the
preemption
provision
says,
if
they
regulate
an
aspect
of
performance
of
an
item
of
equipment,
the
state
can't
act,
and
in
this
case,
the
item
of
equipment
is
antilock
brakes,
and
they
have
not
regulated
the
performance
standards
that
are
at
issue
here.
now,
we
have
not
yet
gotten
to
the
question
of
whether
the
savings
clause
would
in
any
event
sustain
this
lawsuit
even
if
there
were
some
conflict,
but
we
do
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
savings
clause
in
this
case,
by
its
terms,
professed
to
save
any
common
law
liability
that
manufacturers
had.
compliance
with
this
act
was
not
to
remove
any
common
law
liability,
and
the
legislative
history
that
accompanies
that
confirms
what
it
says.
the
legislative
history
said,
now,
we--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
we
have
three...
yes.
we
have...
well,
if
there
were
one
applicable
to
this.
we
have
two
points.
first,
this...
the
tort
lawsuit
is
not
a
safety
standard
within
the
meaning
of
the
preemption
clause.
that's
confirmed
by
the
savings
clause.
that
is,
with
the
benefit
of
the
savings
clause,
we
know
that's
not
what
they
meant
by
a
safety
standard,
a
tort
judgment.
but
beyond
that,
we
do
have
the
savings
clause
itself
which
was
put
in
there,
and
this
is
not
like
the
morales
case,
or
the
american
airlines
case,
where
you
were
dealing
with
a
statute
that
had
had
a
savings
clause
way
back
when,
when
regulating
airlines
was
the
vogue,
and
congress
said,
not
only
are
we
going
to
regulate
it,
but
we
want
not
to
interfere
with
any
state
regulation
of
airlines,
but
then
20
years
later,
congress
came
along
and
said,
now
we
want
to
deregulate
the
airlines,
and
so
we
want
to
make
it
quite
clear,
we
are
now
going
to
preempt
state
regulation,
and
those
unhappy
with
that
reached
back
to
that
earlier
savings
clause,
which
was
not
focused
specifically
on
common
law
lawsuits.
it
said,
all
state
law
is
preserved.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
absolutely.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
after
first
saying
that's
not
this
case,
our
strongest
position
would
be
yes.
when
i
say
strongest,
our
most--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--advanced
position,
yes,
and
it
would
be
yes
because
that
is
what
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
says.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
think
when
you
read
the
language,
the
language
says,
compliance
will
not
exempt
them
from
any
common
law
liability,
any
common
law
liability,
and
you
read
the
legislative
history
of
the
people
who
both
wrote
it
and
who
were
the
conferees
adopting
it.
what
they
have
said
is,
we
do
not
mean
this
to
have
any
effect
on
tort
liability.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
does--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
it
is
the...
i
don't...
that
was
the
chief
justice's
characterization.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
is
to
have
which
provision,
the
savings
clause,
or--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
standards
of
care
are
apart--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it
isn't--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
as
i
say,
that
was
not
my
characterization.
i
said
it
was
our
strongest--
[laughter]
--our
most
far-reaching
characterization
of
the
statute,
and
i
want
to...
if
you
could
just
automatically
assume
at
the
end
of
every
third
sentence
there
is,
this
is
not
this
case--
but
the
argument
that
is
made
by
petitioners
is
that
congress
can't
have
meant
that.
that
would
be
absurd,
to
allow
the
states
to
compensate
people
on
the
theory
that
they
obeyed
a
requirement
of
a
federal
law,
and
there
is,
to
be
sure,
an
absurdity
exception
to
the
plain
language
reading
of
the
statute,
but
i
want
to
suggest
that
this
is
not
absurd.
this
court
has
repeatedly
written
opinions
in
which
it
has
demonstrated
an
understanding
that
there
is
a
difference
between
an
actual
prohibition
on
conduct
and
simply
compensating
people
who
are
being
hurt.
in
silkwood,
all
nine
justices...
and
there
was
no
savings
clause
there,
but
all
nine
justices
said,
we
start
with
the
presumption
that
congress
doesn't
mean
to
take
away
common
law
compensation
if
it
doesn't
provide
any,
and
it's
going
to
take
heavy--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no,
of
course
they
can't
have
an
express
prohibition,
but
a
tort
action
is
not.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes...
oh,
well,
i'm
sorry.
the
tort
action
is
not
an
express
prohibition.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
that
is
what
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
says,
and
there
is
not
an
inconsistency.
georgia
obviously
can't
tell
them
we're
going
to
put
you
in
jail.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
they're
not.
people
can't
violate
the
federal
law.
if
they
violate
the
federal
law,
their
trucks
will
be
removed
from
the
road,
they
will
be
hit
with
heavy
civil
penalties,
and
they'll
have
to
recall
every
truck.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
they
can't
violate
the
federal
law.
they
must
obey
the
federal
law.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but
then
they
have
to
compensate
the
people
they
hurt,
that's
all.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
there
would
be
a
disagreement
about
standards,
but
there
would
not
be
a
conflict
in...
there
would
be
no
threat
to
the
federal
interest,
which
is
what
preemption
is
all
about.
nobody
is
going
to
violate
an
absolute
command
of
the
federal
requirement.
they're
just
going
to
have
to
compensate,
that's
all.
and
so
it's
not
absurd,
and
it's
indeed
consistent
with
what
this
court
did
both
in
silkwood
and
in
goodyear
atomic
v.
miller.
it
recognized
the
congress
may
want
to
have
exclusive
regulation.
you've
got
to
do
it
our
way,
but
we
don't
mind
if
the
state
compensates
people.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
repeatedly,
every
third
sentence.
[laughter]
it
is
our
position
that
obviously
that
is
not
this
case.
there's
no
conflict
at
all.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
there's
no
express
preemption.
there's
no...
we
don't
need
the
savings
clause
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
of
course,
no
judge
in
any
state
in
this
union
would
let
that
case
get
to
a
jury.
let's
be
clear
about
that.
the
test
is
whether
the
manufacturer
behaved
reasonably.
that's
the
test
under
both
causes
of
action
in
georgia.
that's
the
test
for
design
defects
in

i
think
there's
probably
not
a
decided
case
in
history
that
has
held
somebody
to
have
behaved
unreasonably
because
they
obeyed
a
federal
statute.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman

[laughter]
well,
i
want
to
qualify
what
i
just
said.
i
hope
not
in
arizona,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
not
this
case,
your
honor.
thank
you.
