mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
the
implied
preemption
point,
the
department
of
transportation,
the
nhtsa,
perceives
no
conflict
between
its
own
lack
of
regulation
of
antilock
brakes,
and
the
georgia
tort
law
that
is
relied
on
by
respondents,
and
nhtsa
does
not
construe
its
own
federal
safety
standards
either
in
this
case
or
generally
as
conferring
this
federally
protected
immunity
from
state
tort
judgments.
on
the
express
preemption
case,
nhtsa
believes
that,
first,
congress
did
not
intend
the
preemption
clause
of
the
saving
act...
of
the
safety
act
to
reach
tort
liability
and,
second,
that
even
if
tort
suits
are
covered,
that
georgia
law
would
not
be
preempted
in
this
case
because
the
law
would
not
relate
to
an
aspect
of
performance
of
the
standard,
covered
by
a
standard
that
is
in
effect.
section
1397(k)
makes
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
safety
act's
preemption
clause
to
reach
common
law
liability.
congress
enacted
that
saving
clause
specifically
to
preclude
the
argument
that
compliance
with
federal
standards
would
provide
a
defense
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
to
state
common
law
liability,
but
that
is
essentially
what
the
petitioners
are
asking
for
here,
albeit
in
the
guise
of
preemption,
and
congress
did
draw
a
distinction
between
the
state-imposed
prescriptive
standards,
which
were
preempted,
and
the
state-imposed
tort
liability,
which
was
not.
that
is
the
best
explanation
for
the
enactment
of
the
saving
clause,
and
really,
petitioners
have
offered
no
alternative
explanation
for
why
congress
would
have
enacted
it,
or
any
alternative
interpretation
of
the
saving
clause.
there
is
also
what
we
conceive
to
be
the
narrower
ground
for
why
georgia
tort
law
would
not
be
preempted
in
this
case
expressly,
and
that
is,
even
the
preemption
clause
applies
only
when
there's
a
federal
standard
in
effect
and
when
the
state
standard
governs
by
the
same
aspect
of
performance
that
is
regulated
by
that
federal
standard.
nhtsa
does
not
have,
in
effect,
any
safety
standard
that
either
requires
or
prohibits
the
installation
of
antilock
brakes
in
trucks,
and
it
also
does
not
have
in
effect
any
federal
standard
that
does
the
same
thing
indirectly,
as
was
originally
conceived,
such
as
by
regulating
stopping
distances
or
vehicle
stability
requirements
in
trucks.
the
petitioners'
argument,
which
is
essentially
that
what
nhtsa
has
left
unregulated
is
a
form
of
regulation,
is
really
quite
inconsistent
with
the
way
that
nhtsa
perceives
its
role
under
the
safety
act.
nhtsa's
function
under
the
safety
act
is
to
set
minimum
standards
of
performance,
and
generally
speaking
the
regulatory
scheme
does
not
provide
that
anything
that
is
not
regulated
is
regulated,
that
there
is
this
federally
protected
option
to
avoid
further
state
regulation
or
state
liability.
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
area
of
antilock
brakes,
this
is
simply
an
area
that,
as
of
now,
nhtsa
has
left
unregulated,
and
until
it
does
step
in,
the
states
are
free
to
fill
that
regulatory
gap
either
by
prescriptive
standards
or
by
an
enactment
of
state...
or
by
the
implementation
of
state
tort
liability,
which
is
what
the
respondents
are
asking
for
here.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no,
i
don't
think...
i
think
we
would
take
the
position
that
that
should
be
analyzed
as
a
matter
of
implied
preemption.
that
is,
if
the
federal
government
had
a
standard
that
required
a
specific--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--size
headrest--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--and
the
state
standard
of
care...
if
the
state
sought
to
essentially
premise
liability
on
compliance
with
a
federal
mandate,
that
would
preemptive
as
a
matter
of
implied
conflict
preemption.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
exception
for
the
common
law
reaches
cases
like
this.
i
might
say,
i
think
in--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that
the
congress
put
"the
saving
act"
because
it
thought
that
with...
the
preemption
clause
standing
by
itself
might
be
ambiguous
on
the
point,
and
so
the...
and
so--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--tort...
whether
common
law
liability
would
be
considered
a
standard
and
thus
preempted
under
1392,
so
the
saving
clause--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it...
a
standard...
a
state
standard...
a
state
standard
when
there
is
a
federal
standard
in
effect,
a
state
prescriptive
standard
issued
by,
say,
the
george
department
of
motor
vehicles--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--would
be
preempted.
state
tort
liability
that
might
achieve
similar
effect
indirectly
is
not
preempted.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
as
a
matter
of
implied
preemption,
you
cannot
be
held
liable
in
tort
if
that
liability
is
premised
on
compliance
with
a
federal
mandate.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it...
well,
the
provision
says,
compliance
with
federal
standard,
but
if
there's
a...
will
not
provide
a
defense
to
state
tort
liability,
but
i
think
if
there's
a
federal
standard
that
requires
obedience
to
a
specific
mandate,
like
a
headrest
of
a
specific
size,
it
isn't
really--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
it
isn't
really--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
it--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes,
exactly.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
nhtsa
perceives
no
difficulty
with
that
situation.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
only...
there
would
only
be
a
federal
conflict,
a
conflict
with
a
federal...
an
implied
preemption
situation
if
the
reason
why
the
option
were
provided
was,
as
in
the
airbag
case,
to
preserve
a
diversity
of
approaches
because
nhtsa
believed
the
safety
act
required
that.
if
nhtsa
simply
says,
we're
not
regulating...
we're
not
requiring
you
to
have
this
option,
we
think
it
might
be
a
good
idea,
but
you
go
ahead
and
decide
and
there
are
three
ways
you
might
accomplish
something,
that's
not
really
a
conflict
situation.
it's
an
area
that
nhtsa
has
left
unregulated,
and
here,
nhtsa
has
left
open
to
truck
manufacturers
in
some
sense
the
option
to
install
antilock
brakes
or
not
to.
nhtsa--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes.
there
is
a
regulatory
gap
here.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that's
correct,
and
i
might
add,
i
don't
think
that
that
silence
takes
on
a
different
character
just
because
the
standard
was
vacated
in
response
to
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
don't
think
it
is
this
case,
but
i
think
even
there
the
tort
suit
could
go
forward.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
in
that
situation,
if
the
evidence
on
the
rulemaking
record
was
so
compelling
that
nhtsa
could
have
only
concluded
that
the
device,
the
antilock
brake
device,
should
be
prohibited,
then
perhaps
nhtsa
should
have
issued
a
standard
that
prohibited
antilock
brakes,
but--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
there
are
a
number
of--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
there
are
a
number
of
reasonable
explanations
why
congress
drew
the
distinction
between
state
prescriptive
standards
and
common
law
liability.
congress
might
have
believed
that
preempting
common
law
liability
would
be
a
greater
intrusion
under
federalism
and
state
sovereignty
because
the
common
law
had
been
in
operation
for
a
long
period
of
time.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that's...
it's
a
plausible
reason
for
why
congress
might
have
done
it,
but--
