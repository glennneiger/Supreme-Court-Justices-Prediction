mr.
james
s.
liebman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
curtis
lee
kyles
is
on
death
row
for
a
robbery-murder
he
steadfastly
claims
he
did
not
commit,
and
that
his
initial
accuser,
beanie
wallace,
did
commit.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
jury
had
a
reliable
opportunity
to
assess
the
evidence
on
that
identity
question,
notwithstanding
the
quantity
of
evidence
that
the
prosecution
suppressed.
both
sides
agree
that
the
materiality
standard
of
united
states
v.
bagley
controls.
under
that
standard,
mr.
kyles'
conviction
must
be
overturned
if
disclosure
of
the
evidence
suppressed
by
the
state
would
have
created
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
reasonable
doubt
in
the
mind
of
one
or
more
of
the
jurors,
and
a
reasonable
probability
is
a
probability
sufficient
to
undermine
confidence
in
the
outcome.
although
legally
narrow,
the
case
is
factually
complicated,
and
i'd
like
to
take
a
couple
of
minutes,
if
i
could,
to
give
the
background.
when
dolores
dye
resisted
a
thief
in
the
parking
lot
of
a
schwegmann's
supermarket
in
new
orleans,
the
thief
shot
her
once
in
the
face
at
point
blank
range,
walked
to
her
car,
and
drove
off.
the
state's
evidence
that
kyles
was
the
killer
was
in
four
categories.
first
were
four
eye-witness
identification
of
kyles
as
the
killer,
all
of
them
confirmed
by
an
in-court
viewing
of
kyles
standing
side-by-side
with
beanie
wallace.
second
was
the
portion
of
a
vinyl
roof
of
a
car
in
a
blurry,
blown-up
photograph
of
the
crime
scene
which
prosecutors
argued
resembled
kyles'
car.
third
was
physical
evidence
that
the
state
claimed
that
kyles
had
possessed
but
kyles
said
he
did
not
possess,
mainly
the
victim's
ford
ltd
which
beanie
wallace
claimed
kyles
had
sold
to
him,
the
victim's
purse
and
personal
effects
the
police
found
in
a
large,
plastic
trash
bag
outside
the
kyles'
home,
and
a
gun,
the
murder
weapon,
found
behind
the
stove
in
the
kyles
kitchen.
and
fourth,
then,
were
physical
evidence
that
kyles
admitted
possessing,
a
2-inch
square
schwegmann's
receipt
with
kyles'
fingerprints
on
it
found
in
the
ltd
and
15
cans
of
dog
and
cat
food
found
in
the
kyles'
kitchen,
some
of
which
matched
the
brands
that
the
victim
bought.
kyles
then
offered
the
testimony
of
seven
witnesses
tending
to
show
that
all
of
the
state's
evidence
was
consistent
with
kyles'
innocence
and
beanie
wallace's
guilt.
first,
one
of
the
eye
witnesses
admitted
she
only
saw
the
perpetrator
from
the
side
and
back
and
had
not
identified
a
photo
of
kyles
in
a
photo
array,
and
the
other
three
eye
witnesses
who
had
identified
kyles
in
a
photo
array
admitted
that
they
saw
the
same
picture
of
kyles
five
times
before
they
testified
at
trial
and
identified
him
in
court.
second,
kyles
himself
testified
that
you
couldn't
tell
the
color,
make,
model,
or
any
attributes
of
the
car
in
the
blurry,
blown-up
photograph
and,
in
any
event,
it
wasn't
his
car.
third,
defense
witnesses
testified
that
they
saw
beanie
driving
the
victim's
car
within
an
hour
of
the
killing
and
furtively
changing
its
license
plates,
that
beanie
had
the
opportunity
to
plant
the
purse
and
gun
when
he
was
at
the
kyles'
home
and
alone
in
the
kyles'
kitchen
on
the
sunday
prior
to
the
police
search
on
monday,
and
then,
as
to
the
sales
receipt,
kyles
testified
to
hitching
a
ride
with
beanie
in
the
ltd
to
buy
cigarettes
and
transmission
fluid,
and
as
to
the
pet
food,
his
witnesses
testified
that
the
kyles
family
kept
a
cat
and
a
dog,
and
a
police
photograph
was
introduced
showing
a
bottle
of
hartz
dog
shampoo
in
a
closet
in
the
kyles'
home.
as
i
will
shortly
show
in
detail,
there
are
four
separate
reasons
why
there
would
have
been
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
reasonable
doubt
if
the
state
had
disclosed
the
evidence
it
suppressed
rather
than
suppressing
and
misrepresenting
it.
first
are
the
suppressed--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--he
was
not
called
to
testify
at
trial.
he
was
present
in
that
courtroom,
but
he
was
not
called
to
testify.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
that
is
true,
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
subject
of
the
ineffective-assistance
portion
of
this
claim
which
has
been
addressed
in
the
lower
courts
and
is
part
of
the
cert
petition
here,
though
we
did
not
address
in
our
brief,
and
that
is--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
on
the
brady
claim...
that's
right.
on
the
brady
claim,
we...
what
we
assume
is
that
had
the
state
disclosed
the
suppressed
evidence,
the
use
of
that
evidence
would
be
the
use
that
competent
counsel
would
make
of
it,
but
we
assume
that
it
would
be
the
effect
of
that
evidence
in
the
trial.
the
court
below
found
that
a
strategically
reasonable
attorney
would
not
call
beanie
wallace
no
matter
what.
now,
on
the
ineffective
assistance
portion
of
our
claim,
we
disagreed
with
that,
but
it
is
a
matter
of
the
determination
of
the
court
below,
and
in
fact
a
number
of
courts
in
the
state
and
federal
system
have
said
in
this
case
any
attorney
wouldn't
want
to
get
anywhere
near
beanie.
you'd
want
to
just
present
the
theory
that
he
did
it
and
let
the
jury
achieve
a
reasonable
doubt
on
that
basis.
i
want
to
talk
about
the
suppressed
eye-witness
statements.
as
their
photos
reveal,
and
i
have
brought
copies,
kyles
and
beanie
were
facially
similar
in
bone
structure,
profile,
coloring.
stood
side-by-side,
however,
the
two
men
clearly
and
distinctly
did
not
resemble
each
other.
kyles
was
a
maypole,
6-foot
tall,
125
pounds,
beanie
wallace
a
fire
plug,
5-foot
5-inches
tall,
140
pounds.
the
controlling
issue,
then,
was
whether
the
witnesses
saw
the
killer's
build
as
the
killer
attacked
the
victim
outside
her
car,
or
whether
they
only
saw
the
victim's...
the
killer's
face
when
he
fled
in
the
victim's
car,
and
on
that
issue,
contrary
to
the
testimony
at
trial,
the
suppressed
statements
show
that
only
one
witness
got
a
good
look
at
the
killer's
height,
size,
and
build,
and
that
witness
in
a
suppressed
statement
exactly
described
fire
plug
beanie
wallace,
not
maypole
curtis
kyles.
second,
based
on
the
chance
discovery
of
a
portion
of
a
car's
vinyl
roof
in
the
corner
of
a
blown-up
photo,
the
district
attorney
argued
that
kyles'
car
was
parked
near
the
victim...
near
the
crime
scene
moments
after
the
killer
fled
in
the
victim's
car.
confidence
in
a
verdict
premised
on
this
self-described
key
element...
the
prosecutor
called
it
a
key
element
of
his
case...
is
undermined
by
the
state
suppression
of
a
police
memorandum
showing
that,
if
anything,
the
police
knew
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
the
prosecution
argued,
namely
that
the
police
did
not
leave
matters
to
chance,
that
they
systematically
listed
the
license
numbers
of
"vehicles
parked
in
the
schwegmann's
parking
lots
around
schwegmann's
on
september
20,
1984.
"
and
it
showed
that
the
petitioner's
car
was
not
on
the
list.
the
list
was
suppressed.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
your
honor--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--there
is
a
factual
dispute
about
that,
but
i
don't
think
it's
important.
the
memorandum
itself
disputes
the
factual
finding.
the
factual
statement
was
that
they
only
searched
one
part
of
one
lot.
the
memorandum
itself
said,
here
are
the
cars
parked
in
the
schwegmann's
lots,
plural,
at
the
particular
time.
it
was
done
by
three
detectives,
and
they
had
19
cars,
and
the
thought
that
there
were
too
many
cars
that
three
detectives
couldn't
get
more
than
6
each
is
a
little
bit
hard
to
understand.
nonetheless,
it
doesn't
matter,
because
the
testimony
was
that
the
part
of
the
lot
that
they
did
search
was
in
the
immediate
area
of
the
crime
scene,
and
the
picture
itself,
the
blown-up
photograph
itself,
shows
the
very
edge
of
the
crime
scene,
because
there's
the
police
cruiser
right
there
on
the
edge
of
the
crime
scene,
and
you
can
see
that
the
only
thing
that
separates
the
crime
scene
from
the
blurry
photograph
that's
obscured
is
one
row
of
parked
cars,
so
it's
in
essence
the
second
row
of
parked
cars
over.
they
took
the
list
down
at
9:15
after
the
store
had
closed.
one
can
predict
that
this
car
shown
in
the
photograph
would
have
been
probably
the
closest
car.
certainly
it
would
have
been
one
of
the
closest
cars
to
the
crime
scene.
so
the
finding
was
that
they
only
looked
in
the
immediate
area,
but
the
picture
shows
that
the
car
in
question
was
in
the
immediate
area,
so
i
don't
think
it
really
matters
what
we
do
with
that
factual
issue.
third,
had
the
state
disclosed
only
its
evidence
about
beanie
wallace,
there
is
also
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
reasonable
doubt,
for
the
jury
would
have
seen
that
most
everything
the
police
witnesses
testified
and
that
the
prosecutors
argued
about
beanie
wallace
was
false.
it
also
would
have
shown
that
most
everything
the
otherwise
not
entirely
believable
defense
witnesses
said
about
beanie
was
true,
and
most
importantly,
that
the
police
had
substantial,
affirmative
evidence
in
their
files
that
beanie
wallace
was
the
killer.
finally,
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
reasonable
doubt
arises
from
the
suppressed
evidence,
notwithstanding
the
only
two
untainted
pieces
of
evidence,
the
receipt
and
the
pet
food.
now
for
the
details,
beginning
with
the
eye-witness
identifications,
and
i'm
going
to
focus
here,
as
did
the
majority
below,
on
the
three
identifications
that
seemed
most
reliable
to
the
court
below,
because
they
were
predicated
on
a
photo
array.
although
similar
of
face,
as
i
said,
as
the
photographs
reveal,
maypole
curtis
kyles
and
fire
plug
beanie
wallace
were
unmistakably
different
in
build,
so
the
state's
case
depended
on
the
witnesses'
opportunity
to
see
the
killer
before
he
got
in
the
victim's
car.
at
trial,
the
testimony
claimed
that
the
opportunity
was
present
for
the
witnesses,
and
the
prosecutor
then
bragged
in
summation
that
"all
of
them
had
an
excellent
opportunity
to
view
the
homicide
and
the
person
who
did
it.
"
"nobody
changed
his
story.
"
"nobody
was
trapped
in
a
lie.
"
mr.
james
s.
liebman
no.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
no,
that's
not
right,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
you
have
the
photographs,
and
of
course--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--yes,
the
photographs
are
a
part
of
the
record,
and
i'd
be
glad
to
give
you
the
exhibit
numbers,
if
you'd
like
the...
kyles
is
s-45,
trial
exhibit,
and
d-19
in
the
postconviction,
and
then
beanie's
mug
shot
has
two
numbers
at
trial,
either
d-4
or
s-44.
but
it's
not
only
that,
every
one
of
the
courts
below
made
a
determination.
they
all
tell
you,
we
looked
at
the
photographs
and
this
is
what
we
saw,
and
you
will
see
at
the
trial
court,
fifth
circuit,
the
district
court,
and
even
the
state's
brief
in
this
court,
everybody
says
they
don't
look
alike,
because
they
are
different
in
physical
build.
one
is
much
thinner
and
much
taller,
one
is...
and
it
all
goes
to
height,
weight,
and
build
in
each
of
course.
there's
only
one
judge
in
this
record
that
said,
i'm
going
to
just
look
at
the
two
faces
and
see
what
they
look
like,
and
that's
judge
king
below,
and
in
footnote
55
at
the
joint
appendix,
120
through
21,
she
says,
"i
looked
at
the
faces
alone
and
they
resemble
each
other.
"
in
addition,
there
is
trial
testimony
from...
it's
uncontradicted.
the
only
trial
testimony
about
how
the
two
people
looked
was
from
defense
witnesses,
and
they
testified,
and
this
is
quoting
the
fifth
circuit.
they
said,
"kyles
and
beanie
resembled
one
another
in
profile
and
from
the
side,
and
had
similar
complexions.
"
that's
at
page
55,
quoted
in
the...
or,
paraphrasing
the
testimony
in
the...
that
was
at
trial,
but
it's
in
the
fifth
circuit
opinion.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
there
were
witnesses
who...
no,
there
were
no
witnesses
who
said
they
didn't
look
alike.
the
eye
witnesses
looked
at
them
side
by
side
and
said
it's
him
and
it's
not
him,
and
i'm
sure,
but
they
didn't
characterize
what
it
was
that
led
them
to
that,
but
of
course,
if
you
looked
at
them
you
couldn't
possibly
think
that
they
could
be
the
same
person,
because
one
was
so
much
taller
than
the
other.
but
what
the
suppressed
statements
show
is
that
the
witnesses,
only
one
witness
did
have
the
excellent
opportunity
that
the
prosecutor
claimed.
that
witness
described
beanie
wallace
to
the
t.
the
other
witnesses
did
change
their
stories,
and
one
of
them
could
have
been
trapped
in
a
lie
if
the
statement
had
been
released.
and
let
me
start
with
isaac
smallwood.
on
page
35
of
our
blue
brief
we
have
laid
out
his
testimony.
he
said
that
he
got
a
good
opportunity
to
see
the
assailant's
build
as
he
watched
the
assailant
shoot
the
victim,
walk,
then,
he
said
nonchalantly
to
the
victim's
car,
get
in
the
car,
and
drive
away.
this
testimony
was
very
important
to
smallwood,
because
he
testified
over
and
over
again
that
once
the
killer
was
in
the
car,
he
could
only
see
the
side
of
the
killer's
face
and
nothing
else,
but
as
the
state
now
accepts
in
his
brief,
smallwood's
testimony
was
false.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
no,
that's
not
true.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
because
at
the
first...
you're
referring,
i
assume,
to
the
first
trial,
the
testimony
at
the
first
trial
to
which
the
state
refers
in
its
brief,
and
the
difference--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--there
was
no
difference
on
the
critical
point.
what
smallwood
said
at
the
first
trial...
and
the
state
only
gives
you
page
51
of
the
transcript.
a
lot
of
it's
on
page
52.
what
he
says
was,
i
heard
the
shot
and
i
turned
around,
and
i
watched
the
man
walk
from
his
car,
walk
from
the
crime
scene,
the
murder
scene,
and
get
into
his
car,
and
he
was
asked,
well,
how
did
he
walk?
well,
he
walked
nonchalantly.
so
both
at
the
first
trial
and
at
the
second
trial
and,
in
fact,
in
the
suppression
hearing,
smallwood
said,
i
saw
the
man
outside
the
car.
i
got
a
good
look
at
him
outside
the
car.
the
only
thing
that
was
different
was
whether
he
actually
saw
the
shooting,
but
of
course
nobody's
disagreeing...
there's
no
issue
about
whether
there's
a
shooting
and
somebody
got
killed.
the
only
issue
is
whether
they
got
a
chance
to
see
the
man
before
he
got
in
the
car.
in
addition,
justice
souter,
trial
counsel
did
attempt
to
impeach
smallwood
on
that
minor
discrepancy,
did
he
see
him
from
the
beginning
or
only
part
of
the
way,
and
he
did
it
by
asking
henry
williams,
who
was
smallwood's
partner,
standing
right
next
to
him,
isn't
it
true
that
smallwood
didn't
turn
around
until
after
the
shot
was
fired,
and
his
partner
says
no,
that's
not
true,
so
there
was
no
way
to
impeach
that,
because
you
didn't
have
the
statements
which
would
have
permitted
that,
but
the
critical
point
was
whether
they
saw
him
out
of
the
car.
the
same
thing
is
really
true,
and
in
smallwood's
testimony
he
says--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--because
the
first
trial
said
that
smallwood...
both
trials,
his
testimony
at
both
trials
was
that
he
saw
the
assailant
outside
the
car,
standing
up,
walking,
clear
shot
at
him.
i
could
see...
he
could
see
his
physique.
the
question
was,
could
you
see
the
characteristic
on
which
beanie
and
kyles
differ?
one's
tall
and
thin,
one's
short
and
fat.
they
have
a
similar
face.
and
he
says,
yes.
in
both
trials
he
said
yes,
i
saw
him
walking
from
the
crime
scene
to
the
car.
the
only
difference
is
whether
he
actually
also
saw
the
shooting
or
not,
but
that
did
not
undermine
his
capacity,
his
opportunity
to
see
the
difference
between
the
two
that
makes
the
two
absolutely...
you
couldn't
mistake
them,
but
you
could
mistake
them
in
face
and
that's--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--yes,
i'm
sorry.
in
the
suppressed
statement,
and
i'm
coming
to
that,
what
smallwood
says
is,
i
heard
a
loud
pop.
when
i
looked
around,
i
saw
a
lady
lying
on
the
ground
and
there
was
a
red
car
coming
towards
me.
question:
when
you
heard
the
shot
and
looked,
was
the
black
man
standing
near
her?
no,
he
was
already
in
the
car,
coming
toward
me.
so
he
test...
his
statement,
his
contemporaneous
statement
was
that
he
never
saw
the
man
outside
the
car.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
what--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--you
might
have...
your
honor,
he
doesn't
say...
he
says
he
heard
the
gunshot,
and
then
he's
trying
to--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--the
police
officer
asked
him
exactly
that
question,
your
honor,
in
the...
it's
at
joint
appendix
189
through
'90.
the
police
officer
said,
well,
when
you
heard
the
shot
and
looked,
was
the
black
man
standing
near
her?
he
wanted
to
know,
tell
me
what
you
saw,
and
the
answer
was
no,
he
was
already
in
the
car
coming
towards
me,
and
he'd
already
said
earlier
that
that
was
the
case.
there's
a
lot...
you
have
to
understand,
he
was
actually--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
let
me
explain.
he
was
standing
at
a
construction
site.
essentially
they
were
trying
to
get
cars
going
past
the
construction
site.
there's
a
lot
happening.
he
hears
a
gunshot.
you
know,
in
traffic
and
things
he
may
not
immediately
know
exactly
what
it
is,
and
what
he
said
in
the
earlier
trial
was
that
he
didn't
turn
around
until
his
friend
told
him,
hey,
look,
something's
going
on
over
there,
and
that's
when
he
turned
around,
and
that's
when
he
saw
the
person
in
the
car.
but
in
any
event,
he
was
very
clear...
the
police
explored
exactly
this
point
with
him,
and
he
said,
no,
no,
no,
i
just
didn't
see
him
outside
the
car,
only
in
the
car.
territo's
testimony,
the
second,
is
the
same,
is
similar
in
that
he
testified
at
trial
that
his
only
good
look
at
the
assailant
was
when
the
killer
pulled
the
victim's
car
around
territo's
truck,
stopped
next
to
territo's
car,
they
exchanged
looks,
and
then
the
car
went
on
and
made
a
right
turn.
but
territo's
contemporaneous
statement
was
that
the
light
turned
green
and
the
killer
pulled
continuously
around
him
and
made
the
right
turn,
and
that
while
that
was
happening,
territo
was
focusing
on
getting
the
license
plate
number,
which
he
did.
so
this
made
the
critical
witness
henry
williams,
who
was,
as
the
district
attorney
described
him
as
his
best
witness.
he
told
the
jury,
this
is
my
best
witness,
and
indeed,
by
all
accounts
williams
did
get
the
best
look
at
the
robbery
and
shooting,
and
a
few
hours
later
he
described
the
man
he
saw
commit
it,
and
this
is
the
description
he
gave
at
page
197
of
the
joint
appendix
a
black
male,
about
19
or
20
years
old,
about
5
foot
4
or
5
foot
5
inches,
140
to
150
pounds,
medium
build,
dark
complexion,
and
plaited
hair,
short.
williams
thus
gave
an
identical
description
of
beanie
wallace.
on
that
very
same
day
that
williams
gave
this
statement,
the
police
got
information
and
reflected
it
in
a
police
report
that
said
that
beanie
wallace
had
committed
another
murder,
and
in
it
they
gave
beanie
wallace's
height
and
weight,
and
it
was
5
foot
5
inches,
140
pounds,
same
day.
the
description
was
not
of...
and
also
21
years
old,
which
is
much
closer
than
kyles,
who
was
a
25-year-old
man
at
the
time,
6-foot
tall,
125
pounds.
so...
and
the
materiality
of
williams'
description
of
a
short,
stocky
killer,
like
beanie
wallace,
and
not
a
tall
man
like
curtis
kyles,
a
tall,
thin
man,
is
compounded
by
the
length
the
state
went
to
conceal
it.
because
at
a
pretrial
suppression
hearing
to
identify,
the
defense
counsel
asked
the
chief
detective,
he
said,
i
know
you're
not
going
to
turn
over
the
statements
to
me,
but
i
want
to
know,
tell
me
"in
any
single
point,
were
there
discrepancies
in
the
physical
descriptions
given
of
the
assailant.
"
and
chief
detective
dillman
said
that
the
only
discrepancy
besides
a
few
years
in
age
was
3
inches
in
height,
ranging,
he
said,
from
5
foot
8
inches
to
just
under
6
feet,
and
beyond
that
he
said
explicitly,
because
defense
counsel
kept
pushing,
he
said
there
were
no
other
discrepancies.
confidence
in
the
outcome
is
undermined,
whatever
might
have
been
the
case
here
had
the
state
offered
the
identifications
and
then
turned
over
the
witnesses
for
fair
cross-examination,
on
the
basis
of
the
eye-witness
statements.
they
instead
decided
to
conceal
those
statements,
which
included
clear
evidence
that
somebody
else
had
committed
it,
and
to
present
demonstrably
false
testimony
by
smallwood,
and
that
simply
cannot
instill
confidence
in
the
outcome
but
only
misgivings.
let
me
move--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--your
honor,
the
reason
i
am
prepared
to
draw
that
conclusion,
although
that's
possible,
is
that
state
has
acknowledged
in
its
brief
that
it
was
false,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
state
can
draw
that
inference,
i
can
draw
it,
but
the
most
important
thing,
obviously,
is
that
a
juror
could
draw
the
inference
that
the
contemporaneous
statement
is
the
better
description
than
one
several
months
later.
i'd
like
to
move
now
to
the
evidence
that
beanie
wallace
pointed
the
police
to
that
seemed
to
implicate
kyles.
in
theory,
defense
witnesses
explained
all
that
witnesses
by
saying
that
it
was
beanie
who
had
the
car
at
a
time
when
beanie
said
kyles
had
it,
that
beanie
had
furtively
changed
the
license
plates
on
it,
and
that
beanie
was
in
a
position
to
plant
the
purse
and
the
gun
when
he
visited
the
kyles'
home
and
was
seen
alone
in
the
kitchen.
the
problem,
of
course,
was
that
the
state
impeached
all
of
the
defense
witnesses
by
showing
that
all
of
them
were
friends
of
the
defendant
and
two
of
them
had
criminal
records,
and
then
the
state's
witnesses
resolutely
refused
to
corroborate
the
defense
claims
about
beanie,
and
in
cross-examination
the
prosecutors
ridiculed
those
claims
and
valorized
beanie
wallace.
according
to
detective
dillman
in
testimony,
or
the
prosecutors
in
argument,
there
was
no
evidence
that
beanie
had
a
criminal
record.
that's
a
quote
from
the
prosecutor.
beanie
had
not
informed
for
money
in
the
past,
they
said,
and
he
was
a
good
citizen
informant
with
the
courage
to
call
the
police
and
leave
his
name.
there
was
no
evidence,
the
police
said,
that
beanie
changed
the
license
plate
on
the
ltd.
it
was
not
beanie
who
told
the
police
to
search
the
garbage
for
themselves
but,
rather,
the
police
who
thought
it
up
themselves
and,
they
said,
the
police
did
not
direct
beanie
to
go
to
the
kyles'
home
on
sunday,
nor,
so
far
as
they
knew,
did
he
go
to
the
home
on
sunday,
nor
was
it
logical,
argued
the
prosecutor
in
closing,
for
beanie
to
go
to
a
house
that
he
thought
was
about
to
be
raided
by
the
police.
every
one
of
those
statements
by
the
prosecutor
or
the
chief
detective
was
false
in
ways
in
which
the
testimony
of
seemingly
impeached
defense
witnesses
turned
out
to
be
true,
and
so
the
jury
was
dispossessed
not
only
of
evidence
that
impeached
the
investigation
in
the
case,
the
police
investigation
in
the
case,
but
also
affirmatively
showed
that
curtis
kyles
did
not
commit
the
killing
but
that
wallace
did.
and
if
i
can
give
just
a
couple
of
examples
of
this,
the
tape
reveals
that...
and
the
detectives
testified
in
postconviction,
that
the
police
did
not
think
up
the
garbage
search,
but
that
beanie
wallace
told
them
to
go
search
the
garbage.
that
the
police
were
taking
their
cues
from
the
likes
of
wallace
might
itself
have
created
doubts
about
the
investigation,
given
wallace's
character,
his
prior
record,
the
fact
that
he
informed
for
money
and
all
of
that,
he
was
a
known
murderer,
admitted
murderer.
but
the
evidence
is
much
more
important
because
it
incriminates
beanie
at
the
same
time
as
it
impeaches
the
investigation
for,
inexplicably,
beanie
somehow
knew
that
only
the
purse
and
the
bags
and
some
personal
effects...
he
said
exactly
that.
that's
what's
going
to
be
in
the
garbage
bag,
but
the
gun
won't
be
there.
the
eight
bags
of
discarded
groceries,
they
won't
be...
he
knew
exactly
what
was
going
to
be
in
there,
and
he
knew
it
24
hours
before
the
garbage
bag
even
went
out.
beanie's
handler,
detective
miller,
said,
he
admitted
in
postconviction
that
he
thought
at
the
time
that
beanie
may
have
planted
the
incriminating
evidence
in
the
garbage.
that
the
detective
could
have
thought
that
i
think
suggests
that
a
juror
could
have
thought
that
and
formed
a
reasonable
doubt
on
that
basis.
in
addition,
prosecutor
strider
recorded
his
interview
with
beanie
in
between
the
two
trials.
in
that,
beanie
admitted
that
he
did
go
to
the
kyles'
home
on
sunday,
he
admittedly
was
in
the
kyles
home...
this
is
all
on
page
262
of
the
joint
appendix.
he
admitted
he
was
in
the
kyles
home
and
in
the
kitchen
by
himself,
and
he
admittedly
went
there
not
only
with
the
knowledge
but
at
the
behest
of
the
police.
they
asked
him,
they
called
him
up,
as
page
262
reveals,
and
said,
what
about
the
gun,
and
he
said,
i'll
find
out,
and
he
went
over
to
the
kyles
home,
he
left,
he
called
detective
miller,
he
went
back
to
the
kyles
home,
he
was
there
for
2
hours,
in
the
kitchen
alone,
he
leaves,
and
he
meets
detective
miller
by
prearrangement
on
a
corner,
and
they
talk
about
the
gun.
detective
miller
testifies
in
postconviction,
we
learned
where
the
gun
was
from
beanie.
so
what
you
have
here
is
evidence
that
beanie
knew
that
he
could
get
in
the
house,
put
the
gun
wherever
he
wanted,
because
the
police
were
waiting
for
him
to
come
out
with
information
about
the
gun
before
he
was...
they
were
going
to
move
in.
finally,
we
have
three
statements
by
beanie
which
are
totally
inconsistent
with
each
other
in
every
particular,
and
what
they
reveal
is
a
pattern
that
as
each
new
fact
came
out
that
the
police
knew
something,
beanie
changed
his
story
either
to
pin
something
more
on
kyles
or
to
blame
a
witness
against
beanie
with
having
been
implicated,
though
that
person
had
never
been
implicated
before.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
yes.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
brady
claim
encompasses
everything
that
was
lost
to
the
jury
by
the
ineffectiveness
claim,
but
then
so
much
more,
the
narrow
ground
for
the
court,
is
the
brady
claim,
because
the
prejudice
analysis
is
the
same.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
brecht
would
enter
into
the
case
only
if
there
were
an
error,
in
which
case
it
might
be
analyzed
as
a...
on
the
harmless
error,
but
the
fifth
circuit's
second
reference
to
brecht
says
that
since
we
didn't
find
an
error,
we
don't
have
to
get
to
the
brecht
standard.
my
position
would
be
that
the
bagley
standard
is
sufficiently
strong
that
once
you've
met
the
bagley
standard
you
could
also
meet
the
brecht
standard,
but
that's
not
really
an
issue
before
the
court.
traditionally,
the
court
lets
the
lower
courts
apply
harmless
error
analysis
in
the
first
instance,
once
there's
been
an
error.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
there
was
an
error,
not
whether,
if
there
was,
something
might
follow
from
that.
if
i
may--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--yes,
i'd
be
glad
to
do
that,
justice
stevens.
there
are
really
three
things
that
the
state
might
have
wanted
to
prove
with
the
dog
food.
the
first
was,
was
it
strange
that
kyles
would
have
pet
food,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
on
the
theory
of
both
parties
at
trial
kyles'
family
had
an
interest
in
dog
food.
the
kyles
family
said
they
had
cats
and
dogs,
and
had
four
witnesses
to
say
it,
but
the
state's
theory
was
that
they
took
eight
bags
of
groceries
and
threw
out
everything
but
the
dog
and
cat
food,
and
of
course
their
photograph
showed
the
hartz
flea
shampoo,
so
of
course
there's
really
no
question
both
sides
were
claiming
that
there
was
a
need
for
dog
food
in
this
family.
there
was
an
interest
in
having
dog
food
in
this
family.
so
then
the
second
question
becomes,
is
there
something
about
the
brands
of
dog
food
that
is
inculpatory,
but
there
were
three
brands,
actually
four
brands
in
interest.
there
were
two
matching
brands,
and
the
two
matching
brands
that
she
bought
and
that
they
had
were
the
standard
brands,
kal
kan,
9-lives.
she,
however,
bought
a
third
brand,
and
expensive
brand
for
a
finicky
cat,
but
the
third
brand
that
the
kyles
family
had
was
a
cheap
brand
that
she...
there
was
no
evidence
that
she
would
ever
buy.
so
there
were
a
lot
of
families
in
new
orleans
on
that
day
who
would
have
kal
kan
and
9-lives
dog
and
cat
food
in
their
house,
so
maybe
it's
some
evidence,
but
it
certainly
doesn't
overcome
the
rest
of
the
defects
caused
by
the
suppression.
finally
is
kyles'
testimony.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
no,
your
honor,
the
photograph
was
presented
at
trial.
our
point
about
this
evidence
is,
it's
the
only
untainted
evidence--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--and
you
can't
build
a
case
on
that.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
finally
is
curtis
kyles'
testimony
about
the
food,
and
all
i
can
say
on
that,
your
honor,
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
schwegmann's
advertising
manager,
he
confirmed
every
specific
of
what
curtis
kyles
said.
kyles
said,
i
went
there,
there
was
a
little
white
shelf
tag,
the
prices
were
two-for-something,
three-for-something,
i
thought
it
was
on
sale,
and
i
bought
it,
and
what
the
manager
said
was,
small
white
shelf
tag,
two-for-something,
three-for-something,
it
wasn't
on
sale,
but
we
used
the
multiple
price
because
it
made
customers
think
it
was
cheaper
than
it
otherwise
would.
so
the
only
discrepancy
is
that
the
manager
said
we
used
a
sales
gimmick,
kyles
in
a
sense
said
i
fell
for
the
sales
gimmick,
but
otherwise
it's
absolutely...
and
kyles
is
a
man
of
dull
normal
intelligence
in
this
record,
so
it
makes
clear
that
the
testimony
was
quite
the
same.
i'm
going
to
reserve
the
remainder.
