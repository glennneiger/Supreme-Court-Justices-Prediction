justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
just
to
follow
up
on
that
one
point,
why
is
it
that
the
first
trial
testimony
was
not
wholly
sufficient
for
the
impeachment
purposes
without
the
statement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
standard
does
not
give
much
guidance
to
the
prosecutor
as
to
what
its
constitutional
obligation
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--under
brady,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
on
a
brady
proceeding,
where
the
prosecution
denies
it
has
to
turn
something
over,
the
trial
court
does
make
an
evidence-by-evidence
ruling,
as
to
whether
or
not
each
bit
of
evidence
is
inculpatory
or
exculpatory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
standards
the
prosecutors
have
to
use
is
on
an
evidence-by-evidence--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
precisely.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we'd
have
had
time
to
ask
the
petitioner's
counsel,
both
of
the...
beanie
and
the
defendant
were
in
court,
and
all
four
witnesses
looked
at
both
of
them
in
court
and
said
that
it's
definitely
not
beanie.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
has
the
defense,
or
the
petitioner's
response
been
to
that
in
previous
proceedings,
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
say
that
this
was
suggestive--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--was
beanie
seen
in
the
first
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
was
not
identified?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
beanie
was
in
the
line-ups?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
the
witnesses
ever
shown
mug
shots
of
beanie?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
pretty
clear
that
he
was
complicit
in
this
taking
of
the
stolen
automobile,
or
in
the
use
of
a
stolen
automobile,
that
he
knew
that
it
was
stolen.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
to
the
garbage,
he
might
have
planted
that
first.
