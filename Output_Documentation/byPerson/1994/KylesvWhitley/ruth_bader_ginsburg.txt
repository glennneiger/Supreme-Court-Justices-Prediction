--before
you
finish
that,
i
ask
you
just
to
clarify
two
legal
points.
i
take
it
from
your
argument
you
are
pressing
only
the
brady
point
and
not
the
strickland
point.
everything
in
your
argument
seems
to
indicate
that,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
other
question
is
there's
a
peculiar
reference
in
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
two
references
to
brecht,
and
you
started
out
by
saying
bagley
is
the
standard.
is
it
your
position
that
bagley
is
the
standard
and
brecht
shouldn't
enter
into
this
case
at
all?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
no
indication
why
the
police
didn't
show...
didn't
put
beanie
in
the
line-up,
is
there?
