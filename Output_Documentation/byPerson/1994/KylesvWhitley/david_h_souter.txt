justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
it
also
the
case...
isn't
it
also
the
case
that
you
were
in,
or
the
trial
counsel
was
in
just
as
good
a
position
to
go
after
smallwood
at
the
second
trial
as
he
would
have
been
if
the
disclosure
had
been
made?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
difference
between...
that's
right,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
agree
that
anything
that
would
amount
to
substantial
impeaching
evidence
in
relation
to
evidence
the
state
had
put
in
would
be
subject
to
disclosure?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
it
is
not
your
view
that
substantial
impeaching
testimony
would
be
subject
to
the
brady
obligation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you...
i
take
it
from
the
way
you
answer
that
you
believe
this
judgment
should
be
made
on
an
item-by-item
basis.
therefore,
for
example,
if
the
testimony
impeaching
smallwood
would
not
by
itself
have
risen
to
the
standard
of
undermining
the
verdict,
there
would
be
no
obligation
to
turn
that
over.
am
i
correct
that
you
do
it
on
an
item-by-item
basis?
justice
david
h.
souter
your
view
is
that
that
is
the
standard
that
we
should
apply?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm...
i
want
to
get
back
to
this
point
about
ethics.
we're
not
concerned
directly
here
with
ethics,
we're
concerned
with
the
brady
obligation,
and
do
i
understand
you
to
agree
that
the
appropriate
test
for
the
violation
of
brady
is
a
test
which
considers
the
cumulative
effect
of
all
the
evidence
claimed
to
have
been
withheld
in
relation
to
the
cumulative
effect
of
all
the
evidence
that
in
fact
did
go
in?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't
bagley
concerned,
in
that
respect,
simply
with
the
issue
of
substantially
undermining
the
verdict,
and
wasn't
that
the
sense
in
which
bagley
was
getting
into
cumulativeness?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
ask
one
more
preliminary
question,
and
i
thought
it
was
clear,
but
maybe
it
isn't.
what
the
police
knew
and
what
the
prosecutors
knew
were
different
things
in
relation
to
some
of
these
items
as
evidence,
as
you
have
mentioned.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
state
held
to
a
disclosure
standard
based
on
what
all
state
officers
at
the
time
knew?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
that's
what
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
there
might
well
be
a
brady
violation,
even
though
there
was
no...
as
you
were
saying
earlier,
there
was
no
unethical
conduct
on
the
part
of
a
given
prosecutor.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
my
only
point
was
whatever
the
test
is,
there
could
be
a
brady
violation
and
still
not
be
any
unethical
conduct
on
the
part
of
a
prosecutor
if
he
did
not
know--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
has
everybody
in
the
line-up
got
to
be
a
suspect?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
then,
why
was
that
an
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
presume
neither
do--
--well,
he
was
an
informant.
excuse
me.
he
was
the
informant,
though,
wasn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
in
1984,
a
woman
was
shot
and
killed
in
a
grocery
store
parking
lot
in
new
orleans.
several
days
later,
acting
on
an
informant’s
tip,
the
police
arrested
the
petitioner
curtis
kyles
for
the
murder.
the
murder
weapon
and
other
incrementing
physical
evidence
were
later
found
at
kyles’
house.
after
a
first
trial
ended
in
a
hung
jury,
kyles
was
tried
a
second
time
convicted
of
first-degree
murder
and
sentenced
to
death,
his
conviction
in
sentence
were
affirmed
on
direct
appeal.
during
state
post
conviction
proceedings
however,
it
was
revealed
that
the
prosecution
failed
to
disclose
to
the
defense
many
items
of
evidence
favorable
to
kyles.
among
other
things
that
stated
withheld
eyewitness
statements
taken
by
the
police
soon
after
the
shooting
which
revealed
that
the
eyewitnesses
differed
significantly
in
their
descriptions
of
the
gunman.
the
state,
it
also
withheld
a
number
of
statements
made
to
the
police
by
the
informant.
the
statements
contained
significant
inconsistencies
and
inculpatory
remarks
and
could
have
been
use
to
support
kyles’s
argument
that
the
informant
was
actually
the
murderer
and
had
both
the
opportunity
and
the
motive
to
plant
the
gun
and
the
other
evidence
in
kyles's
house.
after
exhausting
state
avenues
to
relieve
kyles,
review
federal
habeas.
he
claimed
that
his
conviction
had
been
obtained
in
violation
of
this
court’s
decision
in
brady
and
maryland,
which
held
that
the
suppression
by
the
prosecution
of
evidence
favorable
to
the
accused
violates
to
process
where
the
evidence
is
material
to
guilt
or
punishment.
the
district
court
denied
relief
in
the
divided
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
today
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
hold
that
kyles
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
considering
the
cumulative
effect
of
all
this
suppressed
evidence
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
had
the
evidence
been
disclosed
the
results
of
the
kyles’s
trial
would
have
been
different.
the
state
cannot
avoid
this
result
by
arguing
that
the
police
failed
to
bring
the
favorable
evidence
to
the
prosecutor’s
attention.
the
suppressed
evidence
would
have
supported
a
powerful
cross-examination
of
the
state’s
two
best
eyewitnesses.
it
would
have
bolstered
the
defense
argument
that
the
informant
was
a
real
murderer
and
would
have
cast
out
on
the
thoroughness
and
reliability
of
the
police
investigation.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
in
which
justice
ginsburg
and
breyer
joined
and
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
kennedy
and
thomas
joined.
