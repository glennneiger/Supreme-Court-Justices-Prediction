before
you
get
onto
that,
was
beanie
called
at
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
assert
that
the
defendant's
main
hope
for
acquittal
was
that
beanie
did
it,
yet
the
defense
did
not
call
beanie?
justice
antonin
scalia
--purposes
we
have
to
assume
that
that
was
not
incompetent
assistance
of
counsel,
i
assume?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
rebuttal
to
that
was
that
they
didn't
list
all
of
the
cars.
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
there
a
factual
dispute
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
all
we
have
for
it
is
your
word
that
the
two
are
not
recognizable
one
from
the
other
except
when
you
see
them
both
standing
up.
i
mean,
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--conceded
by
everybody?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
must
have
taken
a
long
time
to
turn
around
after
the
pop.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
gunshot,
and
he
turns
around,
and
the
fellow
who
did
the
gunshot
at
close
range
had
already
gone
to
the
car,
gotten
in
the
car,
and
is
driving
by?
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
sort
of
stood
there
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
make
any
sense,
is
all
i'm
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
necessarily
false
evidence
by
smallwood.
you
don't...
one
of
the
two
was
in
error.
it's
either
the
later
or
the
earlier.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
was
withheld
that
would
have
destroyed
that
was
simply
the
photograph
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
peebles,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
the
test
you're
giving
us.
i
can
understand
using
a
cumulative
test
after
there
has
been
an
established
violation
of
brady.
you
look
at
each...
not
just
each
single
piece
of
evidence
that
should
have
been
turned
over
one
by
one,
but
you
look
at
all
of
them
and
see
whether
that
would
have
made
a
difference.
but
you're
not
just
urging
that,
you're
saying
that
there
isn't
even
a
violation
until
you
consider
all
of
the
evidence
cumulatively.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can
never
say
that
any
single
piece
of
evidence
has
to
be
turned
over.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
put
it
the
other
way.
you
can
never
say
that
any
single
piece
of
evidence
didn't
have
to
be
turned
over.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
would
not
know
before
the
fact.
you
can
never
say,
before
the
fact,
i
clearly
have
no
obligation
to
turn
this
over,
because
it
all
depends...
whether
you
do
or
do
not
depends
upon
whether,
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
that
piece
of
evidence
plus
all
the
other
ones
that
might
help
a
little
bit
here,
a
little
bit
there,
whether
they
all
together
would
have
made
a
difference.
if
so,
then
retroactively,
you
had
an
obligation
to
turn
it
over.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
crazy,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
peebles,
i
don't
know
why
you
concede
that
once
inside
a
car
a
fire
plug
and
a
bean
pole
look
alike.
i
mean,
is
all
the
discrepancy--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
height
of
these
two
people
in
the
legs?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
torsos
are
the
same
height,
and
one
of
them
has
very
short
legs
and
the
other
inordinately
long?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
you
did.
you
did,
though.
you
said
once
they're
in
the
car
you
can't
tell
the
difference
in
height.
i
think
a
very
short
person
in
a
car
doesn't
come
up
as
high
on
the
window
as
a
very
tall
person.
