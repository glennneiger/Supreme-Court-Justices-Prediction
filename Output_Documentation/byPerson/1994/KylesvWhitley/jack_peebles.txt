mr.
jack
peebles
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issues
upon
which
you
granted
certiorari
include
the
question
of
ineffectiveness
of
representation
as
well
as
misconduct
and
nondisclosed
evidence,
but
the
petitioner's
brief
did
not
go
into
the
question
of
strickland,
so
i
will...
i'll
not
argue
that
point
unless
the
court
has
some
questions
on
it.
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
nondisclosed
information
by
the
police
in
this
case
would
have
created
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
different
verdict
had
it
been
disclosed.
the
state
suggests
as
strongly
as
we
can
that
it
would
not.
the
police
in
this
case
were
in
good
faith,
the
prosecutors
were
in
good
faith,
they
presented
an
extremely
strong
case
of
evidence,
and
the
defendant
was
duly
convicted.
both
the
u.s.
district
court
below
and
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
overwhelming,
and
they
both
analyzed
the
very
items
that
counsel
has
been
talking
about
here,
and
i
would
like
to
go
into
those
myself
and
give
you
the
state's
perspective
as
to
this
same
evidence,
again
on
the
thesis
that
bagley
is
essentially
the
criterion
we're
using,
and
the
law
that
we're
working
under.
mr.
jack
peebles
no,
your
honor.
in
louisiana
we
do
not
agree
that
the
statements,
which
were
not
disclosed,
were
exculpatory.
in
louisiana,
the--
mr.
jack
peebles
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
as
we
interpret
bagley,
the
mere
fact
that
evidence
might
be
favorable,
or
potentially
favorable
to
the
other
side,
does
not
create
a
duty
to
disclose.
the
constitutional
duty
to
disclose
only
arises
when
the
failure
to
turn
over
that
evidence
would
create
an
unfair
trial,
or
would
undermine
confidence
in
the
outcome
of
the
decision,
and
one
of
the
footnotes
in
bagley,
justice
blackmun,
i
believe,
pointed
out
that
if
you
required
a
prosecutor
to
turn
over
anything
that's
potentially
favorable,
then
you
create
an
impossible
situation
for
prosecutors
in
trying
to
make
that
decision.
and
in
fact
i
believe
that
in
bagley
they
expressly
rejected
the
view
taken
by
two
of
the...
by
the
dissent
in
that
case
which
would
have
created
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
turn
over
anything
that
was
potentially
exculpatory.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
think
it
should
be...
if
it
was
substantially
impeaching,
i
think
it
should
be
turned
over,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
ethical
obligation,
and
i
believe
that
in
this
case,
had
the
prosecutors
believed
that
these
statements
contained
substantial
impeachment
material,
they
would
have
turned
them
over,
but
whether
or
not
they
acted
correctly
ethically
in
making
their
decision
not
to
turn
these
statements
over,
we
submit
that
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
the
constitution
was
violated
by
this
action.
mr.
jack
peebles
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
the
state's
position.
mr.
jack
peebles
it
would
not
be
unless
the
failure
to
disclose
that
information
would
create
a
reasonable
probability
that
you
might
have
a
different
outcome
in
either
the
penalty
hearing
or
the
guilt--
mr.
jack
peebles
--your
honor,
when
the
prosecutor
is
making
these
decisions,
it
unfortunately
is
usually
on
an
item-by-item
basis,
but
when
a
reviewing
court--
mr.
jack
peebles
--no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
the
standard
for
the
reviewing
court,
we
submit,
is
to
consider
all
of
the
trial
and
all
of
the
evidence
which
was
presented
at
trial,
and
the
nondisclosed
evidence,
and
consider
the
evidence
cumulatively,
and
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
did,
and
they
said
that.
mr.
jack
peebles
it
certainly
does
not.
mr.
jack
peebles
it
certainly
does
not,
your
honor.
it
makes
it
difficult
for
a
prosecutor
to
know,
in
the
perspective
that
he
is
faced
with
when
he
goes
to
trial,
as
to
exactly
what
might
become
important
later
on,
and
that's
why
we
submit
that
a
prosecutor
must
be
given
a
certain
amount
of
leeway
in
making
a
judgment
call
of
this
type.
to
come
back
much,
much
later
and
say,
well,
in
view
of
the
evidence
that
was
presented,
you
made
the
wrong
decision,
i
submit
that
it's
not
proper
to
really
call
his
judgment
unethical
unless
there's
a
clear
showing
that
he
used
very
bad
judgment
and
that
he
did
withhold
evidence
that
should
have
been
disclosed.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
that's
my
position.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
mr.
jack
peebles
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
police
are
entitled
to
a
separate
standard.
that's
the
old
problem
we
have
in
police
enforcement.
here
we
have
a
case
that
was
tried
less
than
3
months
after
the
murder
occurred.
the
prosecutor
dealt
primarily
with
the
chief
homicide
detective
and
his
assistant,
and
the
police
were
doing
all
kinds
of
investigations,
and
they
didn't
actually
deliver
the
homicide
report
to
the
prosecutors
until
2
days
after
the
trial.
now--
mr.
jack
peebles
--he
would
have
turned
it
over.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
that
the
defense
would
have
used
some
of
this
material,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
that
had
the
prosecutor
known
about
some
of
this
material,
they
would
have
turned
it
over
simply
to
avoid
the
kind
of
problem
that
they
actually
ran
into
in
this
case,
but
that
had
to
do,
we
submit,
with
the
ethics
of
the
prosecutor
at
that
time,
which
we're
prepared
to
defend
in
this
case.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
the...
it
should
have
been
disclosed,
in
my
opinion--
mr.
jack
peebles
--there
was
a...
no.
mr.
jack
peebles
not
under
the
context
of
this
case.
mr.
jack
peebles
if
i
may
elaborate...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jack
peebles
as
we
appreciate
the
bagley
test,
your
honor,
that
is
the
rule.
five
justices
of
the
court,
as
we
appreciate--
mr.
jack
peebles
--yes.
i'm
sure
there
are
single
pieces
of
evidence
which,
by
themselves,
could
be
of
sufficient
importance--
mr.
jack
peebles
--a
prosecutor
might
have
a
duty
to
disclose
it,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
create
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
think
that's
what
bagley
says.
mr.
jack
peebles
well,
i
think
that's
what
bagley
says,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
submit--
mr.
jack
peebles
--yes.
bagley
didn't
really
speak
to
the
issue
of
the
cumulative
effect
of
the
evidence.
we
would
suggest
that
the
cumulative
effect
of
the
evidence
is
that
which
is
properly
considered
would
come
from
the
fact
that
whether
due
process
is
violated
depends
upon
whether
the
defendant
received
a
fair
trial,
and
the
only
way
you
can
determine
whether
he
received
a
fair
trial
on
review
is
to
look
at
all
of
the
evidence.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
it
usually
doesn't
come
up
in
the
trial
context,
your
honor,
because
if
it's
not
disclosed,
it's
usually
not
revealed
until
later,
but
the
reviewing
court
judge,
if
it
gets
pointed
out
to
them
before
the
appeal--
mr.
jack
peebles
--yes,
case--
mr.
jack
peebles
--evidence...
that's
the
only
one
we
can
use,
your
honor,
because
we
don't
know
what
the
evidence
is
going
to
be--
mr.
jack
peebles
--until
after
the
case
is
over,
and
it's
so
much
easier
to
look
at
a
case
after
it's
over,
especially
long
after
it's
over,
than
it
is
at
the
time.
in
this
case,
for
instance,
there
is
just
no
question,
i
submit
from
a
reading
of
all
of
the
transcripts,
that
these
prosecutors
did
a
conscientious
job,
and
they
never
considered
beanie
to
be
a
suspect
in
this
case,
and
they
never
considered
these
statements
to
present
a
substantial
conflict
insofar
as
the
evidence
that
they
presented
was
concerned.
if
i
may
go
into
that
briefly,
unless
the
court
had
other
preliminary--
mr.
jack
peebles
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
the
state
is,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
no
question
about
that.
we're
not
trying
to
differentiate
between
them.
mr.
jack
peebles
if
by
a
brady
violation
you
mean
the
obligation
to
turn
over
anything
that
is
of
potential
value
to
the
defendant,
we...
our
argument
is
that
if
you
want
to
define
the
brady
violation
that
way,
that's
fine.
but
from
the
standpoint
of
determining
whether
the
denial
or
refusal
to
turn
over
this
information
is
a
violation
of
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights,
the
criterion
set
up
for
doing
that
in
bagley
is
to
look
at
all
of
the
evidence,
determine
whether
or
not
the
nondisclosure
of
this
evidence
created
a
reasonable
probability
that,
had
the
evidence
been
disclosed,
you
would
have
had
a
different
result.
that's
the
test,
we
submit.
mr.
jack
peebles
if
it
was
inadvertent--
mr.
jack
peebles
--that's
correct,
and
i
think
that's
probably
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
prosecutors
were
never
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
tape
that
was
made
of
beanie
in
this
case
by
the
police.
the
prosecutors
were
never
aware
of
the
printout
of
the
license
plates
that
occurred
in
this
case.
they
so
testified
at
the
trial.
and
in
fact
this
printout
was
never
in
the
da's
file.
it
was
located
4
years
after
the
trial
was
over
in
a
police
department
file,
and
i'm
sure
the
reason
it
remained
in
the
police
department
file
was,
when
they
saw
that
it
was
a
printout
which
did
not
include
the
defendant's
car,
and
they
did
not
feel
that
it
would
assist
in
the
prosecution,
they
just
left
it
there.
mr.
jack
peebles
on
postconviction
relief,
the
entire
da's
file
and
the
police
files
were
made
available
to
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
don't
recall
whether
there
was
a
court
order,
but
we
did
it
voluntarily,
i
do
know
that.
there
was
no...
there
was
no
attempt
to
withhold
any
of
this
information
pertaining
to
the
printout
or
any
other
aspect
of
this
case.
mr.
jack
peebles
no,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
it's
not
clear.
the...
detective
miller
at
the
postconviction
hearings
testified
that
the
printout
represented
license
plates
from
vehicles
in
the
immediate
area.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
submit
that
the
picture
represented
a
car
that
was
not
in
the
immediate
area,
your
honor.
you
can
look
at
the
picture
and
perhaps
make
your
own
mind
up
about
that.
mr.
jack
peebles
it's
a...
it's
a
question
of
interpretation
of
the
evidence,
the
interpretation
of
the
pictures
and
that,
but
that
picture
of
that
car
was
not
a
major
part
of
the
state's
case.
this
case...
the
problem
with
this
case
from
our
perspective
is--
mr.
jack
peebles
--it
was.
it
was,
but
from
our
perspective,
we
have
a
tremendously
overwhelming
case
of
eye-witness
testimony
here,
plus
additional
hard,
factual,
tangible
evidence,
and
the
other
side
is
attempting
to
get
the
court
to
look
at
what
were
really
very
minor
parts--
mr.
jack
peebles
--of
this
trial.
mr.
jack
peebles
they
all
gave
opinions,
your
honor,
regarding
the
height
of
the
perpetrator,
as
i
recall.
robert
territo
said
that
he
was
close
to
6
feet,
henry
williams
said
he
was
5-4
to
5-5,
willie
jones,
who
tentatively
identified
the
perpetrator,
said
he
was
about
5-9,
and
lionel
plick,
who
was
another
witness
who
did
not
testify,
said
he
was
about
5-10.
there
is
no
hard
evidence
in
the
record
comparing
the
heights
of
these
two
people,
beanie
and
the
defendant.
now,
in
the
statement
that
was
taped,
they
asked
beanie
to
describe
kyles
and
he
said,
he's
about
my
height,
and
the
officer
then
said
well,
it
appears
to
be
about
6
feet
tall,
but
if
you
look
at
the
photographs,
and
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
and
the
fifth
circuit
commented
on
this,
beanie
appears
to
be
taller
than
kyles.
i'm
sorry,
kyles
appears
to
be
taller
than
beanie,
their
complexions
are
different,
and
their
facial
structure
is
quite
different.
but
all
of
that
simply
goes
to
the
question
of
how
well
each
of
these
people
could
see
this
perpetrator,
and
the
fact
is
that
in
this
case
the
perpetrator
had
seven
people
look
at
him,
or
at
least
six
people
look
at
him,
when
he
caused
the
victim
to
scream.
two
of
these
people
were
in
automobiles
right
close
by
on
a
road
right
next
to
the
parking
lot,
three
people
were
working
on
the
parking
lot,
and
two
people
were
standing
at
a
bus
stop
some
distance
away.
now,
the
two
people
standing
at
the
bus
stop
were
about
200
feet
away,
and
they
could
see
the
actions
of
the
person,
give
a
general
description
of
him,
but
they
could
not
identify...
could
not
identify
curtis
kyles
as
the
perpetrator.
now,
the
others,
however,
two
people
in
the
cars,
were...
had
occasion
to
be
very
close
to
the
perpetrator,
and
the
three
people
working--
mr.
jack
peebles
--the
trial
testimony,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
no,
no.
i'm
basing
the...
of
the
four
people
who
testified
at
trial,
both
their
statements--
mr.
jack
peebles
--three
of
those
gave
statements.
mr.
jack
peebles
their
statements.
mr.
jack
peebles
six
statements
were
given
to
the
police.
mr.
jack
peebles
we're
not
certain
that
the
prosecutor
saw
those
statements,
but
for
purposes
of
this
case,
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
they
either
saw
the
statements
or
that
they
should
have
seen
them.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
they
testified
4
years--
mr.
jack
peebles
--yes.
they
testified
4
years
after
the
event,
and
they
said
we
probably
saw
the
statements.
we're
not
certain.
at
one
point
they
said,
i'm
sure
i
did
see
the
statements,
but
he
didn't
presently
remember
seeing
them.
but
they
did
state
clearly
that
their
conviction
was
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
statements
that
was
of
substantial
value
to
the
defense,
and
therefore
they
felt
no
obligation
ethically
to
turn
the
statements
over.
the
state
presented
four
eye
witnesses,
three
of
whom
testified
that
they
saw
the
shooting,
saw
the
defendant
leave
the
area,
and
some
of
them
were
as
close
as
15
feet
to
the
defendant
as
he
slowly
drove
by
them,
and
they
testified
positively
that
this
defendant
was
the
person.
and
after
the
defendant's
attorneys
took
the
position
that
another
person,
beanie,
was
the
perpetrator,
the
state
brought
all
of
these
witnesses
back,
had
beanie
come
into
the
courtroom,
had
the
defendant
stand
next
to
him,
and
then
each
of
these
four
defendants
again
positively
identified
curtis
kyles
as
the
perpetrator,
and
they
said
that
beanie
was
not
the
perpetrator.
beanie
does
not
look
anything
like
curtis
kyles.
the
state
trial
judge
commented
on
this
in
his
opinion
on
postconviction
and
emphasized
the
fact
that
they
don't
resemble
each
other.
the
fifth
circuit,
in
its
opinion,
said
that
if
you
look
at
the
photographs,
you
can
tell
they
don't
resemble
each
other.
your
honor,
we...
your
honors,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
close
question
here
but
that
you
have
two
separate
individuals,
and
that
they
did
not
appear
alike,
and
that
the
state,
as
a
result,
had
a
very
strong
case.
now,
the
defense,
the
petitioner
here
had
complained
about
the
statement
particularly
of
isaac
smallwood.
mr.
smallwood
was
one
of
three
workers
who
was
on
the
schwegmann's
lot
at
the
time.
when
he
originally
was
questioned
by
the
police
at
the
scene,
he
said,
i
heard
a
pop,
i
looked
up
and
i
saw
this
car
coming
toward
me,
and
the
fellow
came
very
close
to
me
and
i
think
i
can
recognize
him.
now,
when
they
tried
the
case
the
first
time,
he
said
that
same
thing.
i
saw
the...
i
heard
a
pop,
i
saw
the
car
coming,
and
i
could
recognize
the
man
as
he
came
by
me.
at
the
second
trial,
he
said
he
saw
the
entire
thing.
now,
neither
the
state
nor
the
defense
picked
upon...
picked
up
on
the
fact
that
there
was
this
discrepancy,
and
the
reason,
i
submit,
that
they
didn't
pick
up
on
this
fact
was
that
the
discrepancy
was
essentially
unimportant.
the
discrepancy
involved
simply
whether...
at
what
point
he
first
started
viewing
the
perpetrator.
as
the
fifth
circuit
pointed
out
there
was
no
part
of
mr.
smallwood's
statement
in
which
he
made
a
statement
which
would
challenge
his
ability
to
recognize
and
identify
the
defendant,
or
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
identification
was
not
in
question
there.
mr.
jack
peebles
well,
we
submit--
mr.
jack
peebles
--we
submit
that
there...
it
doesn't
make
that
much
difference.
most--
mr.
jack
peebles
--yes.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
mr.
jack
peebles
that
didn't
make
any
difference,
and
then
he
came
within
15
feet
of
him
and
drove
slowly
by.
mr.
jack
peebles
no.
that's
correct.
as
to
smallwood,
it
would
be
difficult
for
him
to
tell
how
tall
he
was.
according
to
my
notes--
mr.
jack
peebles
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
the
response
is
that
there
was
a
misidentification--
mr.
jack
peebles
--they
are
saying
that
because
there
had
been
one
prior
trial,
which
it
ended
in
a
mistrial,
and
there
had
been
prior
pretrial
hearings
in
which
kyles
had
appeared
in
court
and
was
seen
by
these
witnesses,
that
this...
this
influenced
them
in
deciding
at
this
trial,
the
previous
occasions
on
which
they
had
seen
beanie
had
influenced
them
on
this
occasion.
that
was
the...
that
was
the
argument
that
they
have
persistently
maintained.
however,
that--
mr.
jack
peebles
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
he
was
not
identified
at
the
first
trial.
he
was
present
outside
the
courtroom,
but
he
was
not
brought
into
the
courtroom.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
don't
concede
that.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
don't
concede
that,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
intend
to
concede
that
point.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
would
rephrase
it,
your
honor,
to
say
that
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
determine
the
height
of
a
person
in
the
car.
if
i
may
suggest
to
justice
kennedy,
the
fact
is
that
within
4
days
after
this
trial,
though,
aside
from
the
court
appearances,
the
police
presented
eye...
i'm
sorry,
photographic
line-ups
to
these
people,
and
according
to
the
testimony
at
the
pretrial
hearings,
the
witnesses
immediately
and
without
hesitation
picked
out
of
this
photographic
line-up
kyles.
mr.
jack
peebles
he
was
not,
but
they
all
picked
out
kyles.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
think
one
of
them
was,
your
honor,
my
recollection
is,
i
can't
tell
you
which
one,
and
that
that
one
said...
on
postconviction,
that
one
said
that
it
was
not...
it
was
not
beanie.
that
was
jones,
if
i
recall
correctly,
willie
jones.
the
defense
showed
willie
jones
a
photograph
of
beanie,
i
believe
with
the
hairpiece
from
kyles,
and
jones
said
no,
it
was
not.
so
we
submit
that
the
evidence
was
very
strong
by
the
state
there
with
these
eye-witness
identifications,
but
we
would
point
out
that
in
addition
to
these
identifications--
mr.
jack
peebles
--he
was
not
a
suspect,
your
honor.
he
was
never
a
suspect.
we
had
both
the
chief
homicide
detective--
mr.
jack
peebles
--no.
no,
but
they
had--
mr.
jack
peebles
--well,
he
was
not
under
arrest
or
anything.
he
was
just
a
citizen.
we
had
no
reason
to
put
him
in
the
line-up.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
he
was
the
informant,
but
the
police
at
no
time
suspected
beanie
of
being
a
suspect
in
this
case.
that
was
their
conscientious
conclusion.
in
addition
to
the
evidence
of
the
eye
witnesses--
mr.
jack
peebles
--i
think...
i
would
suggest
that
probably
that
is
a
conclusion
that
could
be
drawn
by
a
rational
person.
that's
why
i
think
the
state
steered
clear
of
presenting
beanie
as
a
conscientious
person
that
we
could
rely
upon.
we
didn't
call
him
as
a
witness.
we
didn't
make
his
character
a
witness,
as
a
subject
of
the
case,
and
we
did
not
present
a
theory
of
the
case
which
required
the
jury
to
believe
beanie.
the
only
time
beanie's
name
was
mentioned
was
when
the
defense
attorney
cross-examined
the
police
officials
with
regard
to
how
they
obtained
some
of
the
evidence,
and
that
evidence
included
the
sales
slip
found
in
the--
mr.
jack
peebles
--your
honor,
we
can't
know
that
for
sure.
all
we
can--
mr.
jack
peebles
--the
theory
was
that
it
probably
was
the--
mr.
jack
peebles
--yes.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
that
was
only
conclusion
that
could
be
drawn
from--
mr.
jack
peebles
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
that
was
the
state's
thesis,
and
in
addition
to
that
fact,
the
murder
weapon
was
filed
in
kyles'
residence.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
defense
claims
that
beanie
planted
that
weapon,
but
a
close
examination
of
the
record
shows
that
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
do.
when
the
police
came
to
kyles'
house,
they
found
not
only
the
weapon,
but
they
found
a
holster
for
the
weapon
in
a
separate
room,
they
found
bullets
that
fit
the
weapon
in
a
separate
dresser
drawer,
they
found
a
number
of
these
things,
which
indicated
that
kyles
possessed
this
weapon,
and
that
it
would
have
not
been
easy
for
all
this
to
be
planted.
but
in...
not
just
the
weapon,
the
petitioner
is
claiming
that
beanie
planted
the
lady's
purse
in
kyles'
garbage.
in
order
to
do
this,
kyles,
according
to
the
theory
of
the
petitioner,
beanie
would
have
had
to
tell
the
police
on
saturday
you
better
check
his
garbage,
and
then,
before
the
police
checked
the
garbage
on
sunday,
kyles...
i'm
sorry,
beanie
would
then
have
had
to
go
to
kyles'
house
the
next
day
and
plant
the
evidence.
that's
an
unlikely
scenario
for
anyone
who's
planting
evidence.
mr.
jack
peebles
he
might
have.
he
might
have,
but
anyone
could
have
planted
it,
but
it's
speculative.
it's
so
speculative
that--
mr.
jack
peebles
--well,
i
don't
think
the
prosecutor
knew
that
as
a
fact.
mr.
jack
peebles
the
police
said
that
they...
the
police
contact
with
this
man
was
detective
miller,
and
detective
miller
didn't
even
inform
his...
the
principal
homicide
detective
in
this
case
of
most
of
the
things
that
he
did
with
his
informant.
that
seems
to
be
the
way
that
police
operate
with
informants,
and
that's
not
to
say
the
state
shouldn't
be
held
responsible
for
everything
the
informant
tells
the
police,
but
that's
simply
the
situation
here.
now,
with
regard
to
the
pet
food,
that
is,
again,
a
fairly
minor
part
of
the
state's
case.
the
fact
is,
though,
that
when
the
police
came
to
the
kyles'
apartment,
they
found
stacks
of
kal
kan
dog
food
and
9-lives
cat
food,
and
that
just
happened
to
be
the
same
kind
of
cat
food
and
dog
food
that
the
victim
traditionally
purchased,
so
testified
her
husband.
however,
i
don't
want
to
take
this
out
of
perspective.
our
case
did
not
rely
upon
the
pet
food
or
the
victim's
purse
being
found
in
the
garbage,
or
these
pieces
of
tangible
evidence.
the
heart
of
the
state's
case
was
eye-witness
identification,
which
was
strong
and
was
never
broken,
in
spite
of
vigorous
cross-examination.
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
here
that
the
witnesses
only
saw
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
from
the
side,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
we
submit
is
taking
a
very
narrow
view
of
what
these
witnesses
saw.
the
fact
is
that
they
saw
this
petitioner
from
the
moment
of
the
shooting
until
after
he
got
in
his
car,
drew
off
the
lot
and
onto
the
highway
and
then
even
waited
for
a
red
light
before
he
finally
escaped
beyond.
they
all
said
they
got
a
very
good
view
of
him.
they
all
positively
identified
him.
mr.
jack
peebles
thank
you
very
much.
