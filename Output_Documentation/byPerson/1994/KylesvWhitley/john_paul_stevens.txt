justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
haven't
explained...
i'm
not
sure...
is
that
also...
is
that
different
from
the
suppressed
statement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
liebman,
could
you
comment
on
the
dog
food
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
peebles,
before
you
get
into
that,
is
it
common
ground
that
there
was
a
duty
to
disclose
the
suppressed
statements
and
the
information
that
mr.
liebman
talked
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but...
excuse
me
just
a
minute.
if
one
assumes,
just...
i
know
you
disagree
with
it,
but
one
assumes
that
they
contained
impeaching
material
that
might
have
helped
the
other
side's
case,
would
you
agree
there
would
have
been
a
duty
to
disclose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
preliminary
question?
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
some
of
the...
call
it
suppressed
material,
undisclosed
materials,
whatever
term
you
want
to
use,
was
known
to
the
police
but
not
actually
disclosed
to
the
prosecutor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
is...
was
there
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
police
to
disclose
to
the
prosecutor...
how
do
we
measure
what
the
prosecutor
would
have
done
if
he'd--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--known
about
it,
or
are
the
police
allowed
to
withhold
sort
of
in
a
separate...
is
there
a
separate
standard
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
didn't
one
of
the
prosecutors
testify
that
had
some
of
this
material
been
presented
to
him,
he
would
have
turned
it
over?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
take
a
specific
example.
what
about
the
smallwood
statement
that
was
inconsistent--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--with
an
important
part
of
the
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
a
duty
to
disclose
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
a
constitutional
duty
to
disclose
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
it
rather
clear
that
if
the
printout
had
been
available
to
the
prosecutor,
that
the
prosecutor
could
not
have
made
the
argument
about
the
picture,
which
was
right
near
to
the
scene,
that
he
did
make?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
and
the
picture
was
also
the
immediate
vicinity,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
opponent
just
misrepresented
the
record
to
us,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
part
of
the
state's
affirmative
case,
though,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many
of
the
eye
witnesses--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--were
able
to
identify
the
height
of
the
perpetrator?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
talking
about
just
based
on
their
statements,
not
on
the
trial
testimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
trial...
seven
eye
witnesses
testified--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
there
were--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--when
you
refer
to
seven,
it
was
seven--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--statements
given
to
the
police.
justice
john
paul
stevens
six,
and
how
many
of
those
six
were
turned
over,
(a)
to
the
prosecutor,
and
(b)
to
the
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you're
saying
in
part
is
that
it
is
possible
the
prosecutors
were
not
aware
of
the
statements
and
any
possible
discrepancies
between
the
statements
and
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
they
wouldn't
have
had
a
duty
to
correct
the
errors
in
the
witness'
statements.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
according
to
your
opponent,
he...
if
he...
it
makes
a
big
difference
if
you...
if
you
rely
on
the
size
of
the
perpetrator,
whether
he
saw
him
outside
the
car
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
that
discrepancy,
isn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
is
it
not
correct
that
there
is
a
discrepancy
between
the
suppressed
statement
and
the
testimony
as
to
whether
he
saw
him
outside
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
point
is
that
that's
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
course,
driving
by
in
a
car,
you
couldn't
tell
how
tall
he
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
about
the
sales
slip,
i
was
curious,
is
it
the
state's
position
that
the
sales
slip
was
the
slip
of
the
victim's
purchases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
their
theory
in
presenting
it?
it
was
a
very
small--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--even
though
it
was
much...
then
smaller
than
her
normal
amount
of
purchases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
that
she
did
not
make
her
typical
purchases
that
week.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
she
did
make
her
typical
purchases
of
dog
food.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
she
did
make
her
typical
purchases
of
dog
food
but
of
nothing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--else
in
her
weekly
shopping.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
of
course,
the
prosecutor
argued
that
he
wasn't
even
there
on
sunday
when
they
knew
he
was,
if
i
remember--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
police
knew
he
was.
this
is
another
thing
the
police
didn't
tell
the
prosecutor.
