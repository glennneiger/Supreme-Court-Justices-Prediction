mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
invalidated
a
longstanding
regulation
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
interprets
the
term
"harm"
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
endangered
species
act's
prohibition
against
the
taking
of
listed
species.
the
regulation
defines
the
statutory
term
"harm"
to
mean
an
act
which
actually
kills
or
injures
wildlife.
the
second
sentence
elaborates
upon
that
basic
definition
in
one
particular
circumstance.
it
provides
that
harm
includes
significant
habitat
modification
or
degradation
that
actually
kills
or
injures
wildlife
by
significantly
impairing
its
essential
behavioral
patterns,
including
breeding,
feeding,
or
sheltering.
the
court
of
appeals
invalidated
this
regulation
on
its
face.
the
court
concluded
that
the
take
prohibition
in
section
9
of
the
act
applies
only
to
the
direct
applications
of
force
against
wildlife.
respondents
argue
for
a
comparably
narrow
interpretation
saying
that
the
take
prohibition,
including
harm,
applies
only
to
conduct
that
is
purposeful
and
directed
at
wildlife.
in
our
view,
both
of
these
narrow
constructions
are
wrong.
a
party
challenging
a
regulation
on
its
face
bears
a
very
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
no
circumstances
exist
under
which
the
regulation
may
be
valid.
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
respondents
have
failed
to
show
that
congress
categorically
excluded
those
deaths
or
injuries
to
protected
wildlife
that
result
from
habitat
modification.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
for
a
criminal
violation--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--knowing.
the
statute
specifically
requires
in
section
11(b)
that
the
person
must
act
knowingly.
that's
also
true
for--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
the
person
must...
need
not
know
that.
in
fact,
congress
specifically
amended
the
act
in
1978
to
change
the
scienter
from
wilfully
to
knowingly,
to
change
it
from
a
specific
intent
crime
to
a
general
intent
crime.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
a
question
of
knowledge
of
the
law
which
is
nor
ordinarily
required.
what
is
required,
though,
under
our
interpretation
of
knowingly,
is
that
the
person
must
know
that
the
conduct
in
which
he
is
engaging
will
have
the
prescribed
effect
on
the
protected
wildlife.
in
other
words,
he
must
know
that
there
is
significant
habitat
modification
for
wildlife,
and
must
know
that
it
will
impair
the
behavioral
patterns,
such
as
depriving
it
of
food,
depriving
it
of
essential
shelter.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
x-citement
video,
the
court
made
clear,
i
believe,
that
it
was
not
necessary
that
the
person
know
that
the
material
was
obscene
in
the
legal
sense,
but
what
the
person
did
have
to
know
was
the
general
character
of
the
material
in
terms
of
its
displaying
explicit
sexual
acts
involving
minors.
so
here
we
believe
what
the
person
has
to
know
is
that
his
conduct
will
have
the
effect
on
the
wildlife,
but
what...
the
only
thing
he
doesn't
have
to
know
is
that
the
species
is
listed,
and
that
was
what
congress
was
driving
at
by
changing
the
mens
rea
requirement
from
wilful
to
knowingly.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
do.
what...
the
position...
there
may
be
some
question
on
the
facts
whether
the
anticipated
harm
to
the
protected
bird
there
was
sufficiently
immediately
likely
to
happen,
but
the
analysis
that
the
court
applied
as
a
legal
matter
we
believe
is
correct,
because
there--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
the
goats
and
sheep
that
were
permitted
to
graze
there
were
eating
the
shoots
of
the
trees
on
which
the
protected
bird
depended
for
its
entire
habitat,
in
fact,
for
feeding,
for
shelter,
and
ultimately
for
breeding,
and
we
think
that
this
fits
very
readily
into
the
normal
understanding
of
what
the
word
"harm"
means.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
well,
"take"--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--historically--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
concept
of
"take"
may
have
its...
i
think
does
have
its
roots
in
ancient
wildlife
law
as
you're
describing,
but
what
congress
has
done
is
built
upon
that
an
extrapolated
from
that,
and
in
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
congress...
there
were
prior
federal
wildlife
statutes
that
did
not
contain
the
word
"harm",
in
fact
did
not
contain
the
word
"harass".
the
migratory
bird
treaty
act
did
not
contain
either
of
those
words,
and
yet,
for
example,
in
the
fmc
case
we
cite
in
our
brief,
a
corporation
was
convicted
of
a
crime
for
discharging
chemicals
into
a
pond.
the
birds
landed
on
it,
and
died
as
a
result
of
landing
there.
now,
they
died...
it
was
not
in
the
classic
sense
hunting.
it
was
in
that
respect
changing
the
habitat
where
the
bird
would
land,
and
even
under
a
statute
that
didn't
contain
"harm"--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
wasn't,
it
was...
but
it
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
it
was
argued
in
that
case
that
that
wasn't
"kill",
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
found
that
it
was
"kill".
what
congress
did
in
the
marine
mammal
protection
act
was
add
the
word
"harass",
and
then
in
this
statute
specifically
added
the
word
"harm",
and
we
think
that
congress--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
understand
that.
i'm
just
describing
it
in
terms
of
how
the
predecessor
statutes,
other
statutes
on
which
congress
was
presumably
building
when
it
added
the
words
"harass"
and
"harm".
if
i
could,
there
are--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
was...
the
statute
included
"take".
it
also
included
"kill",
and
what
the
court
was
interpreting
there
was
"kill",
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
it
was
promulgated
almost
contemporaneously
with
the
passage
of
the
act,
soon
after
that,
and
significantly,
then,
this
court
in
its
celebrated
case
in
tva
v.
hill
concluded
in
that
case,
pointed
out
not
only
that
the
construction
of
the
tellico
dam
would
have
violated
section
7
of
the
act,
but
that
it
would
have
also
violated
the
take
prohibition,
because
it
would
have
destroyed
the
habitat
of
the
snail
darter
that
was
necessary
both
for
breeding,
or
for
spawning,
and
for
feeding.
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
act
is
pervasive
in
its
protection
for
species,
and
pointed
out
with
specific
reference
to
the
habitat
aspect
of
the
harm
regulation,
saying
we
don't
see
how
completion
of
the
dam
could
other
than
harm
the
snail
darter,
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
have
only
been
seven
criminal
prosecutions.
what
fish
&
wildlife
service
typically
does
is
when
a
problem,
or
potential
problem,
has
come
to
its
attention,
it
notifies
the
landowner
and
invites
the
landowner
to
contact
fish
&
wildlife
service,
because
this
is
not
an
absolute
prohibition.
the
harm
regulation
does
not
establish
an
absolute
prohibition.
what
it
does
is
trigger
a
requirement
that
a
person,
if
he
wants
to
develop
his
land
or
do
something
that
would
destroy
critical
or
essential
habitat,
to
apply
for
a
permit
and
enable
the
fish
&
wildlife
service
to
suggest
ways
in
which
that
activity
could
be
done
in
a
way
that
would
minimize
the
harm.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
fish
&
wildlife
regulations
in
50
c.f.r.
1732(b)
say
that
fish
&
wildlife
shall
issue
a
permit
if
the
statutory
criteria--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
fish
&
wildlife
regulations--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
they
have...
since
the
statute
was
passed
these
regulations
have
provided
that
a
permit
shall
be
issued.
it's
designed
consistent
with
the
overall
thrust
of
the
act
to
protect
the
species
to
ensure
that
before
someone
goes
ahead
and
destroys
habitat
in
a
way
that
may
be
completely
unnecessary,
that
he
obtain
the
advice
and
assistance
of
the
expert
agency
in
a
way
that
it
might
be
tailored.
for
example,
in
the
spotted
owl,
if
a
person
applies
for
an
incidental
take
permit,
what
the
fish
&
wildlife
service
may
say
is
fine,
go
ahead,
but
preserve
some
habitat
along
the
stream
for
the
owls
to
fly
from
one
habitat
to
another,
or
don't
clearcut,
just
take
some
trees
in
ways
that
would
minimize
the
taking
of
protected
species.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
i
may--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
i
may,
on
the
word
"take",
there
are
other
uses
of
the
word
"take"
that
i
think
are
instructive
here.
for
example,
the
other
use
of
the
word
"take"
that
has
been
brought
into
this
very
case
is
that
the
takings
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
there
the
court
has
held
that
"take"
does
not,
in
the
way
respondents
are
arguing,
mean
only
the
physical
appropriation
of
property.
it
also
applies
to
regulations
that
restrict
the
use
of
property.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
there's...
it's
a
word
with
many,
many
meanings.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
the
there
is...
the
word
"take"
also
has
a
meaning
of
taking
lives.
for
example,
one
might
say
that
a
flood
that
inundated
a
valley
took
50
lives,
and
that's
not
hunting,
it
is
action
which
has
the
consequence
of
eliminating--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
if
you're
harming
the
animal
in
a
way
that
affects
its
essential
behavioral
characteristics...
for
example,
take
the
salmon
that
would
be
swimming
up
the
river
to
spawn.
if
you
put
a
barrier
in
the
river
so
it
can't
reach
its
spawning
grounds,
the
salmon
may
die
in
the
same
period
of
time,
but
will
not
be
able
to
reproduce.
i
think
that's
"harm"
within
any
meaning
of
that
term,
and
again,
the
word
"harm"
is
a
statutory
term.
it's
not
just
"take".
congress
supplied
a
definition
which
includes
tva
v.
hill.
and
then,
if
i
may,
in
1982,
significantly,
and
this
is
very
important,
what
congress
did
was
enact
a
permit
program
recognizing,
specifically
recognizing
in
the
senate
report
that
"harm"
means
habitat
modification
that
harms
a
species.
what
congress
did
was
enact
a
permit
program
that
permits
such
takings,
incidental
takings
to
go
forward,
but
only
in
specific
circumstances,
not
that
they're
entirely
outside
the
act,
but
resting
on
the
premise
that
they
are
covered
by
the
harm
regulation.
congress
said
they
may
go
forward
if
they
are
incidental
and
not
the
purpose
of
the
conduct,
and
we
think
those
statutory
phrases
are
inconsistent
with
respondent's
position
that
"harm"
or
"take"
applies
only
to
purposeful
conduct
that
is
aimed
at
a
species
such
as
hunting.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right,
and
also
on
the
face
of
the
act
we
think
refutes
respondent's
suggestion
that
it
refers
only
to
such
things
as
hunting
that
are
aimed
at
or
directed
at
a
specific
animal--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
the
statute--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
still
might
be
a
question,
if
the
secretary
had
given
it
that
interpretation,
but
here,
under
chevron,
the
secretary
has
given
it
this
interpretation
for
17
years
this
court
recognized
that
congress
responded
to
it
and
built
upon
that,
and
we
think
at
least
under
chevron
the
word
"harm"
carries
that
meaning,
and
congress
recognized
that
by
saying
that
you
can
get
a
permit
to
engage
in
activity
that
harms
a
species
incidentally,
and
not
for
the
purpose--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
justice
scalia,
in
the
background
of
both
the
1978
and
1982
amendments
there
is
no
suggestion
that
this
was
a
crazy
interpretation
of
the
word
"harm".
congress
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
a
valid
interpretation
of
the
word
"harm".
there
was
a
proposal
by
senator
garn
to
amend
"harm"...
to
amend
"take"
to
exclude
forestry
practice--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
may
not
change...
it
doesn't...
it's
not
binding
in
that
respect.
at
the
very
least,
though,
we
would
think
it
reinforces
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary's
prior
interpretation
under
chevron
by
adding
a
permit
program
when
congress
could
very
well
have
altogether
exempted
such
a
proposal,
which
senator
garn
offered
and
withdrew.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we
think
the
1982
amendments
are
immensely
significant,
because
of
the
exemptions
that
congress
did
enact,
and
enacted
under
carefully
limited
circumstances,
to
enable
the
fish
&
wildlife
service
to
ensure
that
the
incidental
takes
that
may
occur
as
a
result
of
land
development
and
other
activities
do
not
jeopardize
the
species,
and
significantly,
the
conference
report
is
unusually
explicit
in
the
type
of
situation
that
congress
was
driving
at
in
this
situation,
and
that
is
a
conservation,
a
habitat
conservation
plan,
and
the
conference
report
uses
this
language:
a
habitat
conservation
plan
to
preserve
the
feeding
and
breeding
habitat
of
a
butterfly,
xx
butterfly
on
san
bruno
mountain,
south
of
san
francisco,
which
could
not
have
gone
forward
under
the
harm
legislation.
congress
then,
explaining
the
way
the
1982
permit
process
was
supposed
to
work,
endorsed
what
was
done
there,
which
was
a
cooperative
effort
among
the
fish
&
wildlife
service,
the
county,
municipalities,
and
the
private
developer--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--by
each
house
passing
the
conference
report
which
contained
this
explanation
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
that
is
certainly
true,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
vote
on
the
bill,
but
it
is
often
expressed
in
terms
of
approving
the
report
of
the
conference
committee.
in
any
event,
what
was
clearly
before
congress
was
an
explanation
of
how
this
was
expected
to
work,
which
was
a
situation
such
as
that,
or
for
a
small
landowner
who
wanted
to
develop
land
or
timber
harvest,
to
come
in
with
a
proposal
to
say,
this
is
how
i
plan
to
do
it.
i
plan
to
take
the
following
precautions
to
minimize
the
harm
to
this
protected
species,
and
you
can
get
a
permit,
and
that,
in
our
view,
is
a
very
sound
way
for
congress
to
have
enacted
a
statute
and
for
it
to
be
administered.
it's
much
like
riverside
bayview
homes,
where
the
court
emphasized
that
the
fact
that
there
was
a
regulatory
regime
affecting
adjacent
wetlands
did
not
mean
that
no
one
was
going
to
ever
be
able
to
fill
adjacent
wetlands.
it
just
meant
that
there
was
a
permit
program
so
that
that
particularly
sensitive
environmental
area
would
be
scrutinized
by
the
expert
agency.
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
this
has
come
up
as
a
facial
challenge,
and
so
there's
nothing
before
the
court
in
terms
of
how
the
permit
application
would
be
reviewed,
and
whether
respondents
could
then
argue
that
if
a
permit
was
denied,
that
it
was
improperly
denied,
but
here
we
have
a
challenge
to
a
regulation
on
its
face,
arguing
essentially
that
congress
categorically
excluded
harm
resulting
from
habitat
modification.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the
common
theme,
we
think,
that
runs
throughout
the
definition
of
tva
v.
hill
were
of
national
importance,
both--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
may
be,
but
we
think
that's
a
question
of
proximate
causation
and
degree
and
a
factual
question
of
whether
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
purposeful...
purposeful...
two
responses
to
that.
first
of
all,
within
the
definition
of
"take"
itself,
"purposeful"
is
not
a
common
thread.
one
could
kill--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
"kill",
for
example,
in
the
hypothetical
i
was...
or
the
case
i
was
describing
before
of
chemicals
spilled
into
a
pond
that
would
kill
a
bird
that
landed
there,
the
chemicals
were
not
put
in
the
pond
for
the
purpose
of
killing
the
wildlife,
and
yet
it
had
that
effect.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we
think
it
does
not,
and
the
other
reason
we
think
it
does
not
is
because
the
criminal
and
civil
penalty
statutes
contain
a
scienter
requirement
of
knowledge,
but
in
the
separate
sections
that
deal
with
civil
penalties
and
criminal
penalties,
so
for
an
injunctive
action
you
don't
need
to
prove
knowledge,
and
there's
no
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
show
knowledge.
what
congress
was
focusing
on
was
the
impact
on
these
species
which
congress
determined
to
be
of
national
importance,
not
the
blameworthiness
of
individuals
when
it
comes
to
civil
injunctive
actions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it
would
encompass
a
situation
if
you...
for
example,
if
you
attempted
to
block
passage
of
salmon
to
a
spawning
ground
but
were
unsuccessful,
that
would
be
an
attempt
to
harm
the
salmon
species.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
but
that's
the
second
half
of
the
definition,
or
attempt
to
do
any
of
those
things.
the
first
half
of
the
definition
does
not
contain
the
word
"attempt".
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
for
criminal
liability
you
would
have
to
have
knowledge
of
the
consequence.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
for
the
action
itself,
no,
you
would
not
have
to
have
knowledge,
and
again,
there's
no
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
that
for
an
injunctive
action,
because
what
congress
was
focusing
on
was
the
impact
on
the
species.
congress
did
not
want
the
species
to
be
incidentally,
accidentally
killed,
or
have
its
essential
feeding
or
sheltering
grounds
eliminated,
and
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--will
satisfy
it
as
well.
that's
correct.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
stress
that
this
is
not
a
new
question
in
the
administration
of
the
endangered
species
act.
the
regulatory
interpretation
adopted
here
has
been
in
effect
since
1975,
and
this
court
relied...
pointed
to
that
regulation
in
terms
of
the...
in
tva
v.
hill
in
pointing
out
the
pervasive
protection
for
protected
species
under
the
act.
and
in
tva
v.
hill,
the
construction
of
the
tellico
dam
was
not
done
for
the
purpose
of
harming
the
snail
darter.
it
was
not
directed
at
the
snail
darter.
it
was
a
classic
incidental
take
by
destroying
the
habitat
of
the
snail
darter
that
it
depended
upon
for
both
spawning
and
feeding
purposes.
that's
exactly
the
sort
of
application
that
respondents
are
now
challenging
many
years
after
tva
v.
hill
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
it
was,
and
that's
we
think
significant.
the
discussion
of
knowledge,
knowledge
is
not
in
section
13...
excuse
me,
in
1538,
the
basic
prohibition
against
take.
knowledge
comes
in
only
in
the
penalties,
for
civil
penalties
and
criminal
penalties
retrospective
penalties
for
prior
conduct.
for
an
injunctive
action,
you
sue
for
a
violation
of
section
1538,
which
has
know
knowledge
requirement
in
it,
and
that's
consistent
with
the
way
congress
would
have
wanted
the
scheme
to
work.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
you
can--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
you
can
show
that
the
habitat
modification
is
going
to
actually
kill
or
injure
the
species
by
significantly
impairing
its
behavior,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
for
an
injunctive
action,
but
that's
typical
in
civil
injunctive
actions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
again,
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
my
only
point
is
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
my
only
point
is
that
knowledge
is
not
part
of
the
basic
prohibition.
that's
the
only
point
that
i
was
making.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
what...
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
that
is
the
way
this
court
interpreted
the
statute,
and
the
way
congress
responded
to
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
significant
dictum
because
it
greatly
informed
the
way
congress
amended
the
act
in
both
1978
and
1982.
the
construction
of
the
tellico
dam
would
have
violated
both
section
7
and
section
9,
as
this
court
pointed
out.
in
1978,
congress
enacted
the
special
exemption
provision,
exempting
projects
from
section
7
if
they
were
of
regional
or
national
importance,
and
then
said
any
such
project
granted
an
exemption
will
also
be
exempt
from
the
prohibition
against
taking
in
section
9
or
any
implementing
regulations.
given
the
fact
that
this
court
specifically
referred
to
the
harm
regulation,
that
reference
to
regulations
can
only
have
been
to
the
harm
regulation,
and
the
legislative
history
to
the
'78
act
shows
that
that
was
true.
and
then
again
in
1982,
congress
saying
not
at
all
costs,
it
created
the
special
permit
exemption
to
allow
takes
to
go
forward
in
particular
circumstances.
but
it
wasn't
just
in
1982.
in
1973,
the
legislative
history
of
the
report
shows
that
with
respect
to
the
word
"harass"
it
would
allow
the
secretary
to
regulate,
the
house
report
said,
whether
intentional
or
not,
regulate
or
prohibit
activities
of
bird
watchers
where
the
effect
of
those
activities
might
disturb
the
birds
and
make
it
difficult
for
them
to
hatch
or
raise
their
young,
in
other
words,
interfere
with
their
breeding
activities.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
it
would
significantly
impair.
not
just
momentarily
disturb,
but
if
you
had
lights
on
day
and
night--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
interfered
in
a
way
so--
[laughter]
interfered
in
a
way
so
that
it
would
not
breed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
only
endangered--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
and
that's
why
we
think
congress
would
have
added
the
word
"harm"
and
species.
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
the
prior
statutes
referred
to
individual
animals.
this
one
refers
to
harm
to
species,
which
includes
depriving
it
of
food
or
shelter
or
breeding
grounds.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
