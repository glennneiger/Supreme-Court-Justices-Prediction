the
endangered
species
act
of
1973
contains
a
variety
of
protections
that
designed
to
save
some
extinction
species
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
designates
as
endangered
or
threatened.
section
9
of
the
act
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
person
to
take
any
endangered
or
threatened
species.
the
secretary
has
promulgated
a
regulation
that
defines
the
statute
prohibition
on
takings
to
include
“significant
habitat
modification
or
degradation
where
it
actually
kills
or
injures
wildlife.”
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
secretary
exceeded
his
authority
under
the
act
by
promulgating
that
regulation.
the
respondents
are
small
landowners,
logging
companies,
and
families
dependent
on
the
forest
products
industries
in
the
pacific
northwest
and
the
southeast
and
organizations
that
represent
their
interest.
they
brought
this
facial
challenge
to
the
secretary’s
regulation
arguing
that
he
had
exceeded
his
authority
when
he
interpreted
the
statutory
term
called
“harm”
to
include
habitat
modification.
they
alleged
that
they
had
suffered
economic
injury
from
the
application
of
that
regulation
to
the
northern
spotted
owl
and
the
red-cockaded
woodpecker.
in
a
practical
sense
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
applies
to
commercial
activity
that
is
not
intended
and
directed
at
endangered
species
but
just
by
going
ahead
with
the
projects
will
indirectly
have
the
effect
of
destroying
habitat
and
therefore
injuring
the
species.
in
order
to
understand
the
case,
it’s
appropriate
to
go
back
in
the
history
of
few
years.
the
statute
as
i
indicated
was
enacted
in
1973
and
it
contains
three
basic
prohibitions;
one
it
prohibits
the
federal
government
from
undertaking
or
completing
any
action
which
will
destroy
an
endangered
species.
it
authorizes
the
federal
government
in
a
second
provision
to
acquire
land
in
order
to
help
protect
endangered
species
and
then
in
section
9,
the
provision
at
issues
in
this
case
it
directly
prohibits
the
taking
of
species
by
private
parties
and
the
respondents
here
argue
that
was
not
intended
to
overlap
with
the
other
prohibitions.
we
had
a
case
back
in
1977
that
construed
the
impact
of
the
act
on
a
very
important
federal
project
the
construction
of
the
tellico
dam
by
the
tennessee
valley
authority,
which
after
some
$27-$28
million
had
expended
on
the
project,
everyone
thought
it
was
clear
that
it
would
destroy
the
habitat
of
a
small
fish
known
as
“the
snail
darter”
and
the
question
was
whether
the
act
required
that
the
construction
of
the
dam
be
interrupted
and
not
allow
to
be
completed
not
withstanding
the
extraordinary
expenditure
of
public
funds
and
the
court
in
what
i
think
is
one
of
his
finest
opinions
by
the
chief
justice
berger,
upheld
the
statue’s
prohibition
against
completing
the
dam
not
withstanding
it’s
a
excessive
cost
and
in
an
opinion
in
which
he,
its
rather
a
long
opinion
he
discusses
at
great
detail
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
and
its
broad
purposes,
he
pointed
out
among
other
things,
as
it
was
finally
passed
the
endangered
species
act
of
1973
represented
the
most
comprehensive
legislation
for
the
preservation
of
endangered
species
ever
enacted
by
any
nation
and
he
sorted
through
the
legislative
history
and
concluded
that
not
withstanding
the
excessive
cost
involved
in
that
case
the
policy
of
the
statute
as
determined
by
the
congress
of
united
states
required
the
rather
extreme
result
of
holding
the
construction
of
the
dam.
in
the
end
of
this
opinion,
he
had
a
paragraph
that
i
think
merits
quotations
because
that
was
instructed
to
those
of
us
who
had
to
pursue
further
study
the
statute
today.
he
ended
up
saying
our
individual
appraisal
of
the
wisdom
or
un-wisdom
of
a
particular
course
consciously
selected
by
the
congress
is
to
be
put
aside
in
the
process
of
interpreting
a
statute.
once
the
meaning
of
enactment
is
discerned
and
its
constitutionality
determined,
the
judicial
process
comes
to
an
end.
we
do
not
said
as
a
committee
of
review
nor
are
vested
with
the
power
of
veto.
he
then
quotes
a
very
moving
passage,
there
is
attributed
to
sir
thomas
moore
by
robert
bolt
which
i
will
not
take
the
time
of
the
but
i
tell
you
its
in
437
u.s.a
page
195
for
those
of
who
are
interested
and
he
answer
was
by
saying,
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
in
our
constitutional
system
the
commitment
of
the
separation
of
power
which
is
too
fundamental
for
us
to
preempt
congressional
action
by
judicial
decreeing,
what
accords
with
“commonsense
and
the
public
wheel.”
our
constitution
vest
such
responsibilities
in
the
political
branches
and
that
opinion
was
for
the
majority
of
six
over
three
defenders.
today
we
have
another
majority
of
six
over
three
defenders
who
come
to
a
similar
conclusion
in
this
case
and
our
reasoning
someone
who
has
not
is
persuasive
or
complete
as
the
chief
justice’s
was
but
we
rely
and
what
we
understand
to
be
rather
ordinary
interpretation
of
the
word
“harm”
which
is
in
the
statute.
our
understanding
of
the
legislative
history
and
our
feeling
that
in
amendment
of
the
statute
adapted
in
1982
which
authorized
company
such
as
the
respondents
to
seek
permits
to
go
forward
with
their
product
with
their
operations,
if
they
could
come
forward
with
an
adequate
conservation
plan
that
would
save
the
species.
all
of
these
things
together
persuade
us
that
the
secretary’s
regulation
was
within
the
statutory
authority
granted
by
the
congress
and
for
those
reasons;
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
while
joining
our
opinion
has
also
filed
with
separate
concurring
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
have
joined.
