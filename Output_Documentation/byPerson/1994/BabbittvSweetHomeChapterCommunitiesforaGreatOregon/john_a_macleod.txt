mr.
john
a.
macleod
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
three
points
this
morning
in
response
to
the
government's
argument.
first,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
text
and
structure
of
the
act,
and
show
what
9
congress
was
focused
on
certain
types
of
conduct,
and
wasn't
attempting
to
establish
a
broad,
regulatory
authority
over
any
form
of
human
activity
based
solely
on
what
its
injurious
effect
might
be
to
wildlife.
secondly,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
some
of
the
hard
cases
that
come
up
under
the
statute,
and
in
doing
so,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
regulation,
because
it
focuses
on
effect
and
not
on
the
types
of
conduct
with
which
congress
was
concerned,
will
assure
that
the
wrong
questions
are
asked
about
whether
a
take
occurred
in
every
instance.
finally,
i'd
like
to
say
something
about
the
1982
amendments
and
the
meaning
of
incidental
take.
the
1973
congress
focused
on
two
threats
to
rare
species.
it
wanted
to
stop
the
destruction
of
their
necessary
habitat,
and
it
wanted
to
stop
people
from
hunting
and
killing
them
and
trading
in
them.
it
addressed
the
habitat
destruction
issue
in
sections
5
and
7.
those
provisions
say
that
that's
what
they're
about.
section
5
in
particular
provides
a
very
effective
means
for
addressing
the
very
problems
that
the
secretary
claims
authority
to
regulate
under
section
9.
it
is
a
land
acquisition
authority
in
which
congress
said
to
the
government,
if
you
need
to
protect
habitat,
you
have
the
authority
and
the
funding
to
do
so.
section
9
has
a
very
different
purpose.
it
zeroed
in
on
the
issue
of
hunting
and
killing
rare
animals,
and
of
putting
an
end
to
what
was
becoming
a
thriving
business
of
trafficking
in
them,
and
what
it
says
is
very
clear.
it
establishes
a
series
of
prohibited
acts.
that's
in
fact
the
very
title
of
section
9,
"prohibited
acts",
and
what
it
says
is
that
it
is
unlawful
to
import--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
in
section
9(a)(1).
mr.
john
a.
macleod
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
your
honor,
at
page
14a.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
what
congress
focuses
on
in
section
9(a)(1)
and
its
series
of
prohibited
acts
is
the
importation,
or
the
exportation,
or
the
possession,
or
the
selling,
or
offering
for
sale,
or
transportation,
or
delivery,
or
shipment,
or
taking
of
protected
species.
the
focus
that
you
have
there
is
on--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--no,
your
honor,
not
under
the
statute
as
we
read
it.
it
is,
of
course,
under
the
regulation,
because--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--that
is
the
sure
way
to
avoid
it.
now,
there's
another
protection
before
you
get
to
the
land
acquisition
authority,
and
that's
the
protection
of
section
7(a)(1)
of
the
statute,
which
does
impose
on
the
federal
government
a
duty
to
avoid
jeopardy,
as
you
all--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--well,
it's
not...
it's
on
government
lands,
but
it
is
also
private
lands--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--yes.
if--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--justice
stevens,
in...
if--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--under
the
statute
that's
section
1536(a)(1),
and
that
is
at
petitioner's
brief
at
page
6a.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
[laughter]
the
answer
to
the
question,
justice
stevens,
is
when
you're
dealing
with
purely
private
lands
and
there's
no
federal
permitting
or
anything
of
that
sort
involved,
yes,
the
answer
to
that
is
to
use
the
land
acquisition
authority
under
section
5.
now,
it's
possible,
given
a
particular
situation
that
if
it
went
to
a
court,
a
court
might
find,
in
a
given
case,
that
if
there
was
enough
knowledge
and
the
end
result
was
clear,
they
might
be
willing
to
stretch
the
statute
or
the
language
a
little
bit
to
reach
it,
but
certainly--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--well--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--yes.
they
may
try--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--to
do
that
under
the
statutory
purpose,
but
the--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--that's--
[laughter]
the
answer
to
the
question,
justice
stevens,
is
when
you're
dealing
with
purely
private
lands
and
there's
no
federal
permitting
or
anything
of
that
sort
involved,
yes,
the
answer
to
that
is
to
use
the
land
acquisition
authority
under
section
5.
now,
it's
possible,
given
a
particular
situation
that
if
it
went
to
a
court,
a
court
might
find,
in
a
given
case,
that
if
there
was
enough
knowledge
and
the
end
result
was
clear,
they
might
be
willing
to
stretch
the
statute
or
the
language
a
little
bit
to
reach
it,
but
certainly--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--well--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--yes.
they
may
try--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--to
do
that
under
the
statutory
purpose,
but
the--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--that's--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--that's
correct
as
a
matter
of
statutory
language,
justice
stevens.
that
is
our
view.
now,
the
focus
of
section
9(a)(1)
is
on
these
various
kinds
of
specified
conduct
and
on
attempts
to
engage
in
those
kinds
of
conduct.
through
this
section
9
prohibition
congress
wanted
to
stop,
for
example,
such
things
as
the
importation
of
ivory.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
it's
1538--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
yes,
that
is--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--14a.
thank
you.
it
wanted
to
stop
such
things
as
the
importation
of
ivory,
which
was
causing
elephants
to
be
killed.
it
wanted
to--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--well--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--it
is
knowing,
but
it's
also
knowingly
violates,
so
you
have
to
know
what
the
violation
is,
justice
o'connor,
and
what
that
means,
we
think,
is
that
you
not
only
need
to
know...
you
need
to
know
what
a
take
is.
you
need
to
know
whether
it
is
a
violation
or
the
form
of
conduct
which
we
say
it
is
under
the
statute,
or
simply
is
any
kind
of
an
act
that
may
have
an
injurious
effect,
which
is
what
the
government
says
it
is
under
the
regulations.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
we
would
certainly
say
so,
although
the
government's
position
appears
to
be
that
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
yes.
we
would
say
that
that
knowledge
is
necessary,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
that
is
very
much
our
position,
justice
scalia.
i
didn't
mean
to
convey
otherwise.
that's
very
clear
from
the
way
congress
has
used
the
term
"take".
it's
a
term
that's
used
many
times
throughout
the
act.
you
focus...
forgive
me,
justice
breyer.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
no.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
no.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
if
you
were
intending
to
do
that,
yes.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
yes--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--justice
breyer,
that
would
be
a
taking.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
in
your
hypothesis
it
is
an
action
directed
at
wildlife.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
it
would
not
have
violated
the
act--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--in
our
opinion.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
it
would
have
violated
the
regulation,
to
be
sure,
because
the
effect
of
killing
the
birds
is
present,
and
it
may
well
be--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--in
our
opinion,
no,
although,
justice
breyer--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--well,
i
think
that
the
hypothetical
that
you
pose,
justice
breyer,
is
certainly
a
situation
where
a
court
might
well
say,
let's
look
at
the
character
of
the
underlying
conduct.
there
was
some
recklessness
about
it.
there
was
some
indifference
to
whether
you
were
going
to
kill
endangered
birds.
in
these
circumstances,
we
will
interpret
the
take
prohibition
to
reach
that.
the
problem
is--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--well,
i
do
believe
that
if
he's
killing
them
for
fun--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--again,
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
a
circumstance
which
would
not
be
covered
under
the
act--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--if
i
may,
justice
breyer,
i
think
it
is
important
to
look
at
the
various
ways
that
congress
has
used
this
term
"take"
throughout
the
act.
there
is
no
circumstance
in
which
its
use
of
"take"
in
the
various
statutory
provisions
in
which
it
comes
up
can
be
reconciled
with
the
secretary's
position.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
"harm"
is
a
broad
word
in
and
of
itself,
in
a
vacuum,
stripped
of
the
context.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
for
example,
the
government
has
said
that
"harm"
means
injury.
we
believe
it
is
possible
to
injure
an
animal
without
doing
any
of
the
other
words.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
well,
not
necessarily.
if
you...
when
we
go
to
the
zoo,
we
see,
for
example,
signs
that
say,
don't
feed
the
animals.
if
you
feed
an
animal
something
that
is
not
good
for
the
animal,
you
may
injure
it
in
some
way
without
actually
wounding
it,
so
we
do
think
that
it
really
does
have
a
different
meaning.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
and
wouldn't
be
wounding.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
i
was
actually
building
up,
justice
stevens,
to
feeding
them
in
the
wild.
i
didn't
mean
to
confine
them
to
the
zoo.
but
another
example
might
be,
we've
heard
from
mr.
kneedler
a
couple
of
times
about
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
the
fmc
case.
that's
another
example.
if
you
situation,
so
that
would
be
a
covered--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--justice
kennedy,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
shooting
at
children
intending
to
kill
them
and
being
negligent
in
the
way
you
conduct
your
target
practice,
and
again,
it
may
well
be
that
if
you
are
negligent
in
that
circumstance,
that
may
be
enough
to
find
it
to
be
a
take.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
forgive
me,
justice
scalia?
mr.
john
a.
macleod
if
you
didn't
have
a
child
but
you
had
another
animal,
yes,
that
would
be,
we
believe,
an
incidental
take
under
this
statute.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
purposeful
activity
is
the
requirement,
we
believe,
justice--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--because
you
may
well
have
a
situation
where
you
are...
where
you
are
fishing
for
shrimp,
for
example,
and
you
cast
down
a
net
intending
to
catch
shrimp,
and
you
pull
up
an
endangered
turtle,
your
act
is
purposeful
in
the
sense
of
fishing,
it
was
an
action
directed
at
wildlife,
but
you
have
pulled
up
something--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--that
you
didn't
have
in
mind.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
it's
not
enough
in
the
context
of
the
destruction
of
the
habitat,
because
what
congress
focused
on
was
conduct
and
not
on
effects.
it
is...
if
congress
wanted
to--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--well,
we
don't
believe...
justice
souter,
for
example,
under
the
secretary's
regulation,
which
is
what
we
really
are
challenging,
which
is
what's
at
issue
here,
once
you
get
to
injurious
effects,
the
inquiry
goes
no
further.
if
you're
driving
down
the
highway,
for
example,
and
you
hit
a
listed
insect
on
your
windshield,
under
the
secretary's
regulation,
you
have
committed
a
take.
we
say
that's
not
a
take,
but
in
that
circumstance
you
weren't
asking
all
of
the
relevant
questions
about
the
nature
of
the
underlying
conduct
that
congress
put
in.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
we
believe
that
the
facial
challenge
falls
in
this
circumstance,
because
every
single
time
you
apply
the
regulation
you
apply
it
with
a
different
inquiry
than
the
inquiry
which
is
appropriate
under
the
statute.
it
is
simply
not--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--well,
we
have
in
this
case,
justice
souter...
we
have
made
a
challenge
to
the
statute
as
being
ultra
vires.
we
really
aren't
dealing
with
the
knowing
aspect
of
it.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
i
mean
the
regulation.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
the
knowing
requirement
is
in
the
penalty
provisions,
justice
scalia,
and
those
are
at--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--yes,
that's
correct--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--justice
o'connor.
(a)...
(b)
is
the
criminal
penalty,
and
that's
in
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
5a.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
yes.
the
facial
challenge
is
not
out
the
window
because
the
very
nature
of
the
conduct
which
is
specified
by
the
regulation,
namely
the
effects
of
any
activity,
whatever
it
may
happen
to
be,
on
listed
wildlife,
prevents
any
inquiry
by
the
agency
or
by
the
court
about
the
standards
that
the
congress
established
in
defining
"take".
the
nature
of
the
conduct,
it
prohibited
certain
types
of
conduct
not
only
through
the
words,
the
ten
definitional
words
used
to
define
1538(a)(1).
these
are
all
words
of
conduct.
they
say,
do
not
do
these
things.
when
we
think
in
terms
of
thou
shalt
not
kill,
for
example,
we're
thinking,
thou
shalt
not
murder.
we're
not
thinking
of
an
accidental
death.
when
we
say,
do
not
harm
someone,
we
understand
that
as
an
active
prohibitory
word
to
mean,
do
not
use
some
forceful
conduct,
some
direct
action
against
a
species.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
justice
kennedy,
we
don't
say
that
it's
inappropriate
or
irrelevant
to
look
at
effects.
we
just
say
that
you
shouldn't
look
to
the
effects
alone,
but
under
the
regulation,
that's
what
you're
left
with.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
you
can
look
at
the
effects
as
long
as
they're
one
of
a
number
of
relevant
inquiries
under
the
statute.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
that
is
absolutely
correct.
that
would
be
an
incidental
take,
but
it
would
be
a
take
nonetheless.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
it's
certainly
not
insulated
under
the
regulation,
justice
stevens,
that
much
is
clear.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
there
is
a
foreseeability,
a
knowledge
element,
an
opportunity
to
avoid--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--well,
you
don't
know
that
it
is,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
well,
let's
assume
you
don't
know
that
it's
going
to
kill.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
when
you
get
to
the
point
of
knowing
that
you're
going
to
do
something,
if
you
didn't
have
the
regulation,
and
if
that
case
were
brought,
if
there
were
an
enforcement
action
brought
against
you
based
on
that
set
of
facts,
you
may
well
have
a
result
that
would
have
found
that
to
be
a
take,
but
that's
not--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--not
of
the
common--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--it
does,
and
the
fact
is,
congress
could
well
have
written
this
prohibition
in
terms
of
effects
instead
of
in
terms
of
conduct.
if
congress
did
do
that--
mr.

--in
adopting
the
incidental
take
provisions?
mr.
john

i--
mr.
john
a.
macleod
--congress
acted
in
a
way
in
adopting
that
provision
which
is
consistent
with
either
interpretation.
it
is
every
bit
as
valid
to
say
that
an
incidental
take
occurs
in
the
course
of
a
commercial
fishing
operation.
in
fact,
that
language
has
been
in
the
marine
mammal
protection
act
since
1972,
10
years
before
congress
adopted
this
provision
here.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
i'm
sorry,
justice
souter,
i've
lost
your
question.
mr.
john
a.
macleod
because
the
taking
action
doesn't
have
to
be
purposeful
as
against
the
protected
species.
it
can
be
purposeful
against
any
species,
and
if
it
happens
to
sweep
in
the
protected
species,
then
that
is
a
take.
that
is
an
incidental
take,
but
it's
a
take
nonetheless.
you
took
the
wrong
animal,
but
it's
still
a
take.
