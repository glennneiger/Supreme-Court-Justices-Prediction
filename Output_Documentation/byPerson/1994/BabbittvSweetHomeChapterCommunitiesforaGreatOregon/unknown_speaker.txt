unknown
speaker
would
you
tell
us
preliminarily,
mr.
kneedler,
what
the
mens
rea
requirement
is
under
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
go
to
everything
in
the
statute?
must
a
person
know
that
an
endangered...
an
animal
that's
in
an
endangered
species
category--
unknown
speaker
--is
at
risk?
unknown
speaker
but
why
wouldn't
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
have
to
know
that
a
particular
animal
was
endangered?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
that
our
holding
in
x-citement
video
bears
on
the
interpretation
of
the
mens
rea
requirement?
unknown
speaker
but
would
have
to
know,
for
example...
if
you
drained
a
pond
on
your
property,
you'd
have
to
know
that
there
is
a
particular
frog
or
whatever--
unknown
speaker
--it
is
in
the
water--
unknown
speaker
--before
you
could
be--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
that
that
palila
case
from
hawaii
is
consistent
with
your
view?
unknown
speaker
what
actual
injury
or
death
was
found
there,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
word
"take"?
let's
start
with
the
word
"harm"...
"take".
we
have
here
a
statute.
the
operative
provision
of
the
statute
is
the
provision
that
says
it
is
unlawful
for
any
purpose...
for
any
person
subject
to
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
to
take
any
protected
species
within
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
that
word
goes
all
the
way
back,
and
to
take
an
animal,
it's
clear
what
to
take
an
animal
means,
absent
a
definition.
to
take
an
animal
refers
to
hunters.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
historically,
i've
never
heard
it
used
in
any
other
way,
to
take
an
animal,
to
take
a
species
of
animal.
okay,
step
1.
then,
step
2,
you're
going
to
say,
but
there
is
a
definition
of
"take"
in
this
case.
the
definition
happens
to
contain
the
word
"harm".
the
word
"harm",
and
every
other
word
within
that
definition,
can
be
interpreted
in
a
way
consistent
with
that
old-fashioned
meaning
of
"take",
but
the
agency
here
has
chosen
to
take
that
one
word,
"harm",
and
instead
of
giving
it
a
meaning
consistent
with
"take",
has
given
it
a
meaning
that
makes
the
word
"take"
an
absolutely
inappropriate
word
to
use
in
that
operative
provision
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
you
take
an
animal
when
you
plow
your
land
and
accidentally
destroy
the
habitat
of
the
animal.
you
have
taken
the
animal.
i
mean,
nobody...
nobody
would
use
the
word
in
that
sense.
unknown
speaker
only
if
you
choose
to
interpret
the
word
"harm"
the
way
you
want
to
interpret
it.
it
can
be
interpreted
another
way
that
fits
perfectly
well
within
the
concept
of
"take".
unknown
speaker
was
that
a
case
from
this
court?
unknown
speaker
was
that
issue
specifically
raised
within
the
case?
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
regard
a
court
of
appeals
case
as
any
sort
of
a
binding
precedent.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
operative
word
in
that
other
statute?
it
was
also
"take"?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
this
regulation
interpreting--
unknown
speaker
--1975?
unknown
speaker
how
has
the
enforcement
of
the...
that
was
a
case
involving
the
government,
but
against...
enforcement
against
private
actors,
how
has
that
come
about
over
the
years?
before
you
were
engaged
in
an
explanation
of
the
criminal
prosecution
prospect,
but
in
fact,
what
has
the
enforcement
experience
been?
unknown
speaker
it's
only
absolute
if
fish
&
wildlife
wants
it
to
be
absolute.
unknown
speaker
whose
regulations?
unknown
speaker
which
they
can
change.
unknown
speaker
because
when
you
take
trees,
you're
taking
the
owl.
that's
the
theory
of
this?
i
mean,
i
note
the
way
you
use
"take
trees".
unknown
speaker
the
whole
spotted
owl
thing
is
based
on
the
notion
that
people
who
are
harvesting
trees
are
taking
owls?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
realistic
assessment
of
the
meaning
that
was
intended
in
this
particular
statute
by
the
word
"take"?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
could
say
"take"
means
to
commit
theft,
too.
you
take
something
from
someone
else.
but
obviously,
that's
not
the
meaning
used
here.
unknown
speaker
it
can
mean,
too,
you
know...
he
did
a
double
take.
it
can
mean
a
lot
of
things.
[laughter]
but
when
you
say
you
"take"
an
animal,
it
means
you
hunt
the
animal
and
reduce
it
to
your
control
by
wounding
it,
by
killing
it,
by
harming
it.
it
means
harming
the
animal,
not
harming
the
forest,
which
causes
the
animal
to
starve
to
death.
to
say
that
that's
taking
an
animal
seems
to
me
just
weird.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler--
--because--
--i'm
sorry.
no,
i'm
sorry.
go
on.
i've
asked
a
lot.
your
point...
i
take
it
your
point
is
it's
inconsistent
because
the
statutory
modification
in
effect
recognized
the
regulation
as
being
reasonable,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
don't--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
just
interrupt
you?
i
take
it
you're
not
arguing
that
in
the
absence
of
a
regulation
the
word
"harm"
would
cover
what
you
claim
it
covers
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
the
later
statutory
modification
which
acknowledges,
let's
assume
that
it
does,
that
it
includes
habitat
modification,
i
would
find
that
persuasive
if
what
that
modification
did
was
add
some
new
restriction
or
talk
about
the
nature
of
the
restriction
that
had
previously
been
imposed,
but
all
this
amendment
does
is
enable
you
to
get
out
of
the
restriction.
let's
assume
i'm
a
congressman
who
voted
for
the
original
endangered
species
act,
and
when
i
said,
in
that
statute,
it's
unlawful
to
take
any
protected
species,
i
thought
i
meant
it's
unlawful
to
take
any
protected
species,
and
i
find
that
this
agency
has
interpreted
"take"
to
mean
no
citizen
in
the
country
can
do
anything
to
his
land
if
it
harms
a
species.
and
i
say,
my
god,
that's
terrible,
and
i
try
to
get
enough
votes
to
get
that
repealed,
to
get
that
interpretation
repealed
in
the
statute.
i
cannot
get
enough
votes.
there
have
never
been
enough
votes
to
enact
it,
but
there
are
also
not
enough
votes
to
repeal
it.
so
i
say,
well,
at
least
let's
give
fish
&
wildlife
the
authority
to
grant
an
exemption
from
it.
it
won't
be
as
bad.
in
fact,
require
them
to
consider
exemptions
from
it.
that's
a
perfect
explanation
of
that
modification,
and
it
at
no
time
gives
you
a
majority
in
the
congress
who
thought
that
every
citizen
in
the
country
can
be
prevented
from
using
his
own
land
if
that
modification
is
going
to
modify...
is
going
to
harm
wildlife.
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
assumption
binding
upon
us?
if
congress
enacts
a
mitigating
statute
based
on
what
is
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
the
statute,
does
that
make
the
statute
suddenly
change
its
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
have
the
votes
for
it.
having
the
votes
for
it.
having
the
votes
to
overturn
it
is
quite
different
from
having
the
votes
to
enact
it
in
the
first
place.
if
they
never
had
the
votes
to
enact
it
in
the
first
place,
we
shouldn't
be
enforcing
it
upon
all
the
citizens
of
the
country.
which
do
you
think
is
more
persuasive,
mr.
kneedler,
speculation
about
what
congress
might
have
done,
or
the
actual
record
of
what
they
did
in
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
you
say
congress
endorsed
it.
how
did
congress
go
about--
unknown
speaker
--well,
a
conference
report
isn't
the
same
thing
as
legislation.
unknown
speaker
and
each
house
doesn't
pass
it.
what
do
you
mean,
each
house
passing...
did
the
whole
house
vote
on
the
conference
report?
is
there
a
vote
on
a
conference
report?
i
thought
they
vote
on
the
bill.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
do
i
understand
that
these
respondents,
none
of
them
have...
there's
been
no
enforcement
against
any
of
them.
there's
been
no
application
for
a
permit.
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
categorically
include,
would
be
a
better...
it
didn't
include,
would
be
a
better
way
of
putting
it.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
kneedler,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
other
side's
argument
as
categorically
excluding
the
habitat
modification
as
a
step
which
might
lead
to
liability.
if...
i
don't
understand
the
other
side
to
be
arguing
that
if
i
had
a
spotted
owl
nesting
in
the
tree
outside,
and
i
went
outside
and
cut
the
tree
down
for
the
express
purpose
of
killing
the
owl,
who
would
go
down
with
the
tree
and
be
crushed,
that
that
would
be
excluded
from
liability.
it's
habitat
modification...
i
think
what
they're
arguing
is
simply
that
habitat
modification
which
does
not
have
a
purpose
to
kill
or
eliminate
the
species
by
these
various
means
is
excluded.
unknown
speaker
some
habitat
modification
can
be
an
interim
step,
but
it's
not
a
separate
generic
category.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
what
they're
arguing.
unknown
speaker
and
their
answer
to
that
argument
is
that
once
you
get
beyond
the
sort
of
specific
intent
to
kill
through
habitat
modification,
you're
getting
beyond
the
purposeful
activity
which
is
the
common
thread
of
all
the
more
specific
verbs
in
the
definition.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
a
common
thread,
except
for
the
generic
word
"harm"?
unknown
speaker
"kill"
is
a
species
of
"take".
it
carries
a
purposeful
connotation,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
know
of
any
other
federal
criminal
statute
that
provides
for
an
attempt
crime
that
is
attached
to
something
other
than
a
purposeful
crime,
because
this
definition,
which
includes
"harm"...
the
definition
of
"take"
it
says
means
to
harass,
harm,
pursue,
hunt,
wound,
kill,
trap,
capture,
or
collect,
or
to
attempt
to
engage
in
such
conduct.
now,
what
do
you
mean?
this
means
to
attempt
to
cut
down
a
forest?
unknown
speaker
attempt
does
suggest
a
very
purposeful
intent.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
saying
you
don't
have
to
attempt
to
stop
the
salmon
from
reaching
their
breeding
ground.
that's
your
whole
point.
you
don't
have
to
be
attempting
to
doing
that.
all
you
want
to
do
is
build
a
dam
or
something,
and
so
the
attempt
would
be
the
attempt
to
build
a
dam.
unknown
speaker
knowledge--
unknown
speaker
--your
argument
is
that
the
act
may
be
satisfied
by
a
completed
act
which
isn't
purposeful,
but
a
purposeful
attempt--
unknown
speaker
--very
well,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
macleod,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
are
you
reading
from
somewhere,
mr.
macleod?
unknown
speaker
where
may
we
find
it?
is
it
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask...
may
i
give
you
a
hypothetical
that
troubles
me
and
get
your
explanation
for
it?
say
i'm
a
real
estate
developer.
i
want
to
build
a
new
development
in
the
everglades,
a
new
golf
course,
say,
and
i
have
no
desire
to
harm
any
endangered
species,
but
i
do
know
that
if
i
build
this
golf
course
a
certain
rare
bird
will
become
extinct.
is
that
a
taking?
unknown
speaker
yes,
of
course,
under...
but
is
it
your
view
that
in
order
to
prevent
that
from
happening
the
government
has
to
acquire
that
land?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
on
government
projects.
unknown
speaker
i'm
assuming
an
entirely
private
project.
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
any
way
to
stop
it,
other
than
acquiring
the
land?
unknown
speaker
what
is
7(a)?
give
us
a
real
section
number,
would
you?
i--
unknown
speaker
--for
those
of
us
who
are
not--
unknown
speaker
--be
sure
you
answer
my
question
before
you
move
on.
unknown
speaker
what
statutory
language
would
they
stretch,
the
word
"take"
and
the
word
"harm"?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
language...
or
"harass",
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
those
would
be
the
words
they'd
have
to
stretch.
unknown
speaker
but
under
your
view,
they
should
not
do
that.
unknown
speaker
what
statutory
language
would
they
stretch,
the
word
"take"
and
the
word
"harm"?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
language...
or
"harass",
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
those
would
be
the
words
they'd
have
to
stretch.
unknown
speaker
but
under
your
view,
they
should
not
do
that.
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
they're
categorically
prohibited
from
doing
that.
unknown
speaker
this
is
1539,
number
1539?
unknown
speaker
38?
unknown
speaker
oh,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
page
14.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
say
the
mens
rea
requirement
is
for
the
criminal
statute?
what
do
you
have
to
know?
unknown
speaker
if
it's
knowingly.
unknown
speaker
does
the
defendant
have
to
know
that
a
particular
animal
is
on
the
endangered
species
list
and
that
the
conduct
will
injure
or
kill
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
i'm
just
asking
what
your
position
is.
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
that
your
position,
if
you
really
are
serious
about
the
word
"take"
and
the
word
"harm"
as
a
definition
of
"take",
i
would
think
your
position
is
that
it
is
not
enough
to
know
that
the
animals
will
die.
your
intent
must
be
to
reduce
those
animals
to
your
control.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's
one
of
the
problems
i
was
having,
that
the
act
doesn't
say
take
an
animal,
does
it?
it
says,
take
a
specie.
unknown
speaker
and
i
don't
think
daniel
boone
used
to
take
species.
unknown
speaker
not
even
robin
hood.
unknown
speaker
so
that
to
me
signaled
that
this
might
be
a
technical
phrase,
and
then
when
i
got
to
the
technical
part,
which
is
in
the
definition,
i
did
read
this
word
harm,
and
so
you're
talking
about
harming
the
specie.
now,
if
a
person
goes
out
and
puts
guns
around
his
property
that
shoot
up
into
the
air
in
order
to
stop
sparrows,
and
knows
that
they'll
also
stop
protected
birds,
i
take
it
that
would
violate
the
act,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
intending
to
do
is
protect
your
corn,
so
you
put
guns
out,
and
the
guns
you
know
will
not
only
kill
the
sparrows,
they'll
also
kill
a
few
rare
birds.
unknown
speaker
you
know
it.
unknown
speaker
and
on
my
understanding
of
the
law,
intent
includes
both
an
action
that
you
wish
to
have
happen,
and
also
an
action
that
you
know
will
happen
as
a
result
of
what
you
do,
whether
or
not
you
wish
it.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
it's
not
directed
at
wildlife.
what
it's
done,
it's
done
for
entertainment,
but
the
person
knows
it's
going,
as
a
consequence,
to
kill
a
few
rare
birds.
i
take
it
that
that
person
would
have
killed
these
birds,
maybe
all
of
them.
there
are
none
left,
and
i
would
imagine
a
person
who
did
that,
even
if
he
did
it
for
fun
or
for
education,
or
for
whatever
reason,
knowing
that
would
come
about,
would
have
violated
the
act.
isn't
that
so,
or
is
it
so,
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not?
unknown
speaker
so
in
other
words,
if
a
person
goes
out,
and
for
any
reason
he
wants...
and
he
likes
rare
birds,
but
doesn't
care
that
much,
and
sets
traps
for
other
things
which
he
knows
will
have
the
effect
of
killing
the
koala
bears,
the
butterflies
and
everything
else,
even
though
he
says
personally,
you
know,
i
couldn't
care
less,
i'm
doing
this
for
fun,
that
person
does
not
violate
the
act,
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
i
did
not
hold
that
position,
and
held
the
position
that
the
person
who
was
doing
this
for
fun,
or
whatever
reason,
knowing
that
the
koala
bears
would
be
destroyed,
if
i
started
out
thinking
that
that
would
violate
the
act,
then
would
there
be
any
way
to
distinguish
between
the
person
who
did
that
by
shooting
guns
and
the
person
who
did
that
by
chopping
down
trees,
or
the
person
who
did
that
by
modifying
the
habitat
in
other
ways?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
i
want
to
know
what's
right,
not
what
the
court...
you
see,
i
felt,
as
i
read
through
it,
to
be
totally
honest,
that
there
was
no
way
to
reach
your
position,
which
is
certainly
a
reasonable
position,
but
i
didn't
understand
how
i
could
reach
it
without
thinking
that
the
person
who
goes
out
and
kills
the
koala
bears
for
fun
is
also
outside
the
act.
i
mean,
he
kills
them
wanting
to
do
some
other
thing,
and
since
i
don't
see
how
congress
could
have
put
that
outside
the
act,
then
i
don't
see
how
to
reach
your
position.
that's
my
whole
point
which
i'm
driving
towards
that
i
wanted
to
get
a
response
from
you.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no,
i
don't
mean
that.
i
misspoke.
i
mean,
he
intends
to
do
some
other
thing
which
he
knows
as
a
result
of
shooting
these
guns
in
the
air,
or
whatever,
will
have
the
undoubted
consequence
of
destroying
the
koala
bears,
but
doesn't
want
that
to
happen,
but
just
knows
it
will.
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
right.
now,
my
problem
is,
is
that
plausible?
i
agree
with
you
that
the
way
to
get
to
your
position
is
to
deny
my
hypothetical
case,
but
then,
to
me
it
isn't
plausible
that
congress
wanted
to
pass
this
act
and
not
prohibit
the
person
who
for
other
reasons
is
shooting
the
guns
off
and
happens
to
wipe
out
the
specie,
knowing
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
macleod,
why
not
look
at
the
word
"harm"...
as
i
understand
your
position,
it's
as
though
the
word
"harm"
were
not
there.
it
has
no
independent
significance.
it's
going
out
there
to
trap
the
animal,
to
kill
the
animal,
to
collect
the
animal,
but
what
function,
independent
of
those
other
words,
does
the
word
"harm"...
does
it
add
anything?
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
me
an
example,
on
your
reading
of
this
statute,
where
something
would
not
kill,
would
not
trap,
but
would
harm,
and
therefore
be
covered?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
the
word
"wound"
to
take
care
of
that.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you--
--and
that
would
not
be--
--can
you
think
of
another
example?
that's
ingenious,
but
can
you
think
of
another
one?
[laughter]
i
think
that's
a
pretty
good
example.
it's
an
excellent
example.
can
you
think
of
another
one?
i
suppose
a
hunter
who
wanted
to
get
this
game
by
poisoning
instead
of
by
shooting
it,
you
could
get
a
lot
of
game
that
way.
and
he
would
be
hunting...
and
he
would
be
hunting,
and
he
would
be
trapping
and
capturing.
and
wouldn't
be
wounding.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
point
is,
he'd
be
within
the
statute
without
the
word
"harm",
in
his
example.
you
have
responded
to
justice
ginsburg
by
finding
one
example
of
a
harm
that
is
not
otherwise
covered
by
the
statute.
it's
a
very
unlikely
example
that
you're
trying
to
feed
some
endangered
species
in
the
zoo.
[laughter]
can
you
think
of
any
other
example
that
the
word
"harm"
covers
and
would
not
otherwise
be
covered
by
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
as
justice
breyer's
question
points
out,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
saying
is
not
even
consistent
with
the
common
law
of
crimes.
if
two
people
in
two
different
instances
shoot
at
little
children,
one
because
he
hates
children,
the
other
because
he
just
wants
target
practice,
they're
both
equally
culpable,
and
your
position
wants
us
to
distinguish
between
those
two
instances.
that's
not
even
standard
criminal
liability
law.
unknown
speaker
well--
--mr.
macleod--
--a
child
and
a
duck
is
the
analogue,
right?
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
analogue
is
a
child
and
a
duck.
shooting
at
a
duck
and
hitting
a
child
would
be
the
situation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
macleod,
isn't
the
fact
that
the
mens
rea,
in
fact
the
mental
element,
both
civil
and
criminal,
is
knowing,
the
answer
to
what
i
take
is
your
argument...
strike
the
word
"take".
what
i
assume
to
be
your
argument--
[laughter]
--that
in
fact
purposeful
activity
is
the
norm
in
this
string
of
verbs,
and
therefore
"injure"
must
be
read
as
implying
some
purposeful
activity?
if
the
mens
rea
is
knowing,
in
the
statute,
then
in
effect
congress
is
saying
purposeful
activity
is
not
the
requirement,
and
that
makes
the
answer
to
justice
breyer's
objection
even
more
difficult,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
then
why
is
the
state
of
mind
expressly
provided
to
be
knowing?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--true,
but
there's
another
example,
and
that
is
the
case
in
which
you
put
down
the
net
and
you
don't
want
to
catch
the
endangered
species.
that's
not
what
you
want
to
do,
but
you
know
that
that
is,
in
fact,
what
you
are
going
to
accomplish,
and
the
statute
says,
by
using
the
word
"knowing",
that
in
fact
your
knowledge
is
sufficient
to
make
you
liable
under
the
statute.
i
mean,
you
can't...
it
makes
no
sense,
it
seems
to
me,
to
say
that...
for
congress
to
provide
that
you
must
knowingly
commit
a
purposeful
act.
the
state
of
mind
has
got
to
be
knowing,
and
if
the
state
of
mind
is
knowing,
then
there
isn't
a
purposeful
element
in
the
verbs,
and
if
you
know
that
your
net
is
going
to
pull
up
the
endangered
species,
that's
enough,
and
that,
i
suppose,
is
consistent
with
the
secretary's
regulation,
that
if
you
know
the
destruction
of
the
habitat
is
going
to
result
in
the
killing
and
the
injury,
that's
enough.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
know...
but
the
regulation...
it
seems
to
me
the
most
you
can
get
out
of
that
argument
is
that
by
going
to
effect,
the
regulation
adds
an
element
which
is
not
covered
by
knowing
in
this
sense,
that
the
regulation
may
cover
the
case
in
which
you
don't
know
that
you're
going
to
get
the
species
in
the
net,
or
when
the
tree
goes
down,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
me
you're
wrong
when
you
say
it's
got
to
be
purposeful
activity.
so
that
that
can't
be
the
argument
that
wins
the
case.
the
argument
that
wins
the
case
for
you,
i
suppose,
has
got
to
be
that
this
goes
beyond
merely
knowing
activity
to
an
activity
which
has
an
effect
which
is
not
known
at
the
time
it's
committed,
but
that's
not
a
purposeful
argument.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
making
a
facial
challenge,
and
i
suppose
if
there
are
instances,
and
a
substantial
number
of
instances,
in
which
knowing
conduct
would
in
fact
be
consistent
with
the
statute,
that
i
suppose
is
the
end
of
your
facial
challenge,
and
the
most
that
you
could
argue
would
be
in
a
separate
case,
that
the
regulation
should
not
be
construed
to
cover,
could
not
be
construed
to
cover
the
case
in
which
you
had
no
reason
to
know
that
the
representative
of
the
species
was
going
to
be
hurt,
but
you
don't
get
that
by
a
facial
challenge,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
that...
i
mean,
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
you're
simply
saying
the
inquiry
under
the
statute
is
whether
there
was
a
purposeful
act
the
conscious
object
of
which
was
to
destroy
the
species
through
destruction
of
this
individual
member
of
it,
and
if
that
is
not
true,
then
there
are
going
to
be
loads
and
loads
of
instances
in
which
the
secretary's
reg
is
in
fact
going
to
cover
the
kind
of
knowing
conduct
which
i
suppose
the
mens
rea
indicates
was...
requirement
indicates
was
the
object
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
to
the
regulation.
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
knowing
requirement?
what
text
of
a
knowing
requirement
are
we
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
section
1540--
unknown
speaker
--(b)?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
unfair...
the
other
big
sort
of
question
that
i'd
had
is,
you
see,
once
i
get
out
of
this
mens
rea
thing,
to
get
onto
a
different
matter,
i
mean,
you
can
find
a
mens
rea
that...
then
you
win,
but
if
we
reject
that,
then
i
can't
think
of
a
way
of
trying
to
take
"habitat"
out
of
the
word
"harm".
it
seems
that
some
instances
you'd
have
it
there,
some
instances
you
wouldn't,
and
that
your
clients
and
the
others
who
are
worried
about
extreme
applications
of
this
thing
ought
to
go
and,
case
by
case,
say
this
is
an
extreme
application,
if
they're
accused
of
a
crime,
say
the
criminal
element
is
not
there,
if
their
land
is
taken,
say
maybe
they
have
to
have
compensation,
but
what
i
can't
see
is
the
facial
challenge,
where
you'd
say
they're
all
out
the
window.
now,
i'd
like
a
response
to
that.
i'm
putting
that
in
order
to
get
a
response
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
in
judging
whether
or
not
the
actor
is
culpable
under
that
standard,
we
often
look
to
find
what
are
the
logical,
likely,
and
natural
consequences
of
the
acts,
and
that's
the
equation
that
you
want
to
excise
from
this
analysis,
it
seems
to
me,
which
brings
us
almost
full
circle
to
where
we
began,
asking
you
how
to
distinguish
this
purposeful
interpretation
you're
putting
forward
from
what
we
often
and
always
do
in
criminal
law
and
in
mens
rea
analysis.
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
can
look
to
the
effects.
unknown
speaker
mr.
macleod,
i
thought
you
have
to
start
with
the
take.
i
thought
your
position
was
that
what
there
has
to
be
is
a
taking-type
activity.
if
you
are
engaged
in
taking
animals,
and
you
know
that
the
taking
of
some
animals
may
take
one
of
the
protected
species,
you
are
knowingly
taking
the
protected
species.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
engage
in
an
activity
which
is
not
a
taking
activity,
you
are
not
knowingly
taking.
unknown
speaker
so
if
you're
cutting
down
trees,
you're
not
knowingly
taking,
even
though
you
may
kill
an
owl,
but
if
you're
shooting
some
other
species,
knowing
that
there
are
owls
in
the
vicinity,
and
you
shoot
an
owl,
you
are
knowingly
taking
an
owl.
unknown
speaker
but
that...
but
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
example,
you
chop
down
a
tree
and
you
know
it's
going
to
fall
on
someone's
house
and
kill
the
occupant,
but
you
don't
care
about
killing
him,
you
just
want
to
cut
down
the
tree,
is
that
insulated
from
criminal
liability,
and
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
under
the
common
law
of
murder,
isn't
that...
even
though
you
didn't
intend
it,
but
you
just
know
it's
going
to
happen,
that
somebody's
going
to
get
killed
as
a
result
of
your
cutting
down
the
tree--
unknown
speaker
--and
we
have
precisely
the
same
thing
in
this
area.
cut
down
the
tree,
it's
going
to
kill
the
last
particular
bird,
or
something.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
do
know
it.
under
your
assumption,
you
know
it's
going
to
kill,
but
you
don't
care,
because
that's
not
what
you're
interested
in.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
hypothetical
you've
got
to
confront
is
one
where
you
do
have
that
knowledge.
my
golf
course
example,
you
know
you're
going
to
extinguish
the
habitat,
and
you
said
the
only
way
you
can
avoid
that
is
to
buy
the
land,
and
i
don't
understand
how
you
get
around
justice
kennedy's
question.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you--
--i
don't
see
how
you
could--
--concede
that
you'd
be
guilty
of
the
common
law
crime
of
murder
if
you
did
that
but
not
of
the
common
law
crime
of
taking.
unknown
speaker
the
thing
is,
you
knew
you
were
going
to
kill
him,
but
you
would
not
know
you
were
going
to
take
him
because
you
were
not
engaged
in
a
taking
activity.
you
were
cutting
down
a
tree.
it
depends
on
what
word
you're
using
in
defining
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
one
thing,
though,
and
you
said...
i
know
we
haven't
made
it
easy
for
you,
but
you
said
you
were
going
to
get
to
this.
[laughter]
i
mean,
in
the
1982
amendment,
didn't
congress
act
consistently
with
what
i'm
going
to
call
generally
the
knowing
interpretation
here
as
distinct
from
the
purposeful
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
government's
position.
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
unknown
speaker
why
would
congress
have
needed
an
incidental
exception
if
the
activity...
if
it
was
required
to
prove
purposeful
activity
in
every
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
a
requirement
for
liability,
civil
or
criminal,
that
the
destruction
of
the
species
or
the
particular
example
which
would
lead
to
the
destruction
of
the
species
be
purposeful,
i.e.,
it
is
my
conscious
object
to
destroy
the
species,
or
to
destroy
this
individual
member,
why
was
there
a
need
for
an
incidental
taking
exception?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
macleod.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
that
was
an
action
for
an
injunction
in
tva
v.
hill?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
you
can
stop
somebody
from
cutting
down
trees
on
his
land
even
if
he
doesn't--
unknown
speaker
--he's
violated
the
act,
although
he's
not
subject
to
criminal
penalties,
even
if
he
doesn't
know
that
there's--
unknown
speaker
--there's
no
state
of
mind
requirement,
then.
unknown
speaker
but
how
could
that
possibly
happen?
i
mean,
wouldn't
you
be
in
court
getting
the
injunction,
and
you'd
tell
the
person--
unknown
speaker
--that
if
he
cuts
down
the
tree,
it's
going
to
kill
the
koala
bear--
unknown
speaker
--and
by
that
time
he'd
know
it.
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
didn't
happen
to
be
true
you
wouldn't
get
the
injunction.
unknown
speaker
so
i
don't
see
how
there'd
be
no
state
of
mind
requirement.
unknown
speaker
can't
we
pick
an
uglier
example
than
the
koala
bear?
we
don't
have
any
koala
bears
in
this
country,
do
we?
[laughter]
we
pick
the
cutest,
handsomest
little
critter.
this
hill
case,
mr.
kneedler,
is
that
the
case
in
which
we
described
this
statute,
or
congress
in
this
statute
as
having
determined
that
endangered
species
must
be
protected
no
matter
what
the
cost?
is
that
where--
unknown
speaker
--it
really
said
that?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that's
an
adequate
description
of
the
statute
and
of
what
congress
did
and
of
what
congress...
no
matter
what
the
cost?
unknown
speaker
in
dictum,
and
you
want
us
to
stand
by
that
dictum.
unknown
speaker
this
was
on
private
land?
you
couldn't
go
out
on
your
back
yard
and
watch
a
bird
nesting
if
it
might
