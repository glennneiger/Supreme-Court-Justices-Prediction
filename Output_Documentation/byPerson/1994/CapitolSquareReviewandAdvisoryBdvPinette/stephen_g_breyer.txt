justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
quick
question,
please.
could
you
just
repeat
like
in
30
seconds
or
very
briefly,
what...
i
quite
agree
with
you,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
have
a
menorah
and
not
have
a
cross.
i
don't
really...
i
understand
the
difficulty
of
finding
a
distinction,
so
you'd
say,
don't
have
either.
i
see
the
picture,
and
i
can
understand
you
say,
gee,
people
will
think
this
cross
right
in
front
of
the
statehouse
is
a
state
cross,
but
what
i
don't...
that's
your
argument,
all
right.
but
what's
the
legal
test
that
will
say
whether
it
should
be
back
10
feet,
20
feet,
30
feet?
what
is
the
legal
test?
it
sounds
as
if
the
lower
courts
did
apply
a
reasonable
observer
test.
are
you
disagreeing
with
their
application
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
this
court
supposed
to
do,
in
your
opinion?
is
this
court
supposed
to
say,
i've
never
been
to
this
square.
i
don't
know
if
this
photograph
really
telescopes
distances.
what
do
you
want
us
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
state
is
broke,
and
it
says,
the
only
way
we
can
balance
the
budget
is
to
sell
our
10-acre
plot
for
an
office
building,
you'd
let
them
do
that,
wouldn't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there's
one
circumstance
in
which
they
can
totally
eliminate
the
public
forum
and
you
agree.
