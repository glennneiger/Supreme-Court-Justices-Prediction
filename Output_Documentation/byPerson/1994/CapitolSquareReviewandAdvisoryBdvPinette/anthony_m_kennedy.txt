do
you
think
the
reasonable
observer
can
conclude
that
petition
and
assembly
are
important
activities
to
take
place
at
the
seat
of
government,
assuming
that
that
is
a
valid
legal
category?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
your
theory
ask
us
to
presume
what
a
reasonable
observer
would
conclude?
do
we
have
to
make
that
as
some
sort
of
an
empirical
inquiry
in
all
of
these
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
even
if
we
stipulate,
then,
that
most
people,
certainly
most
reasonable
people,
will
not
conclude
that
the
state
is
sponsoring
or
hsa
anything
to
do
with
this
message,
that
the
message
is
still
prohibited,
or
the
message
must
still
be
suppressed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
usually
in
the
law
talk
about
a
reasonable
observer
for
a
starting
point,
and
i'm
asking
you
if
your
theory
doesn't
require
us
to
assume
that
a
reasonable
observer
would
attribute
this
message
to
the
sponsorship
of
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
this
is
not
a
part--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
then
we
must
assume
that
under
your
theory
even
if
a
reasonable
observer
would
not
attribute
this
message
to
the
state,
the
state
still
is
required
to
suppress
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
different,
because
the
whole
assumption
there
was
that
the
state
was
sponsoring
the
message,
and
that's
not
this
case
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
wasn't
the
assumption
of
the
opinion.
the
assumption
of
the
opinion
was
that
it
was
state-sponsored.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
hasn't
occurred
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
any
indication
in
lee
v.
weisman
that
a
graduation
is
a
public
forum?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
haven't
you
conceded
that
this
is
a
public
forum?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
position
a
reasonable
observer
would
think
it's
a
religious
symbol
sponsored
by
the
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
a
reason
be
that
they
didn't
want
the
ku
klux
klan
to
get
in
on
the
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
that
be
a
legitimate
reason
for
adopting
a
rule
prohibiting
all
unattended
displays?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
my
question
is,
suppose,
following
up
the
chief
justice's
question,
the
commission
says,
we
have
had
for
years
a
christmas
tree
and
a
menorah.
now
we
have
a
sign
that
is
very
controversial.
it's
a
symbol
of
hate
to
many
people.
the
only
way
we
can
stop
this
is
to
have
a
new
rule,
no
unattended
displays.
is
that
constitutionally
permissible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
once
you
have
this
rule,
the
state
in
perpetuity,
or
at
least
for
the
reasonable
future,
has
to
allow
the
ku
klux
klan
cross?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
state
say
that
because
there
is
controversy
over
religious
symbols
generally
at
christmastime,
we
are
going
to
leave
the
field,
as
it
were,
and
prohibit
all
unattended
displays?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
can
have
a
ku
klux
klan
cross
on
every
statehouse
lawn
in
the
united
states?
