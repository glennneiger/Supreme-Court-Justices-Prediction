justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
renner,
one
of
the
points
that
you
make
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
seem
to
have
applied
a
rule
that
so
long
as
the
forum
is
public,
and
so
long
as
the
actual
sponsor
is
private,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
that
rule.
i'm
looking
at
page
a8
of
the
petition
appendix,
and
on
that
page
the
court
quotes
from
a
prior
case,
refers
to
those
two
factors,
but
the
quotation
goes
on
to
say,
"although
these
facts
are
not
automatically
determinative,
recent
precedent
indicates
that
they
should
carry
much
more
weight
than
the
details
of
the
display
emphasized
by
the
plaintiffs.
"
now,
i
might
very
well
agree
with
you
that
the
manner
in
which
the
appearance
of
this
display
was
analyzed
was
not
a
very
nuanced
treatment,
but
i
also
have
difficulty
in
going
as
far
as
you
would
have
us
go
and
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
just
applying
an
automatic
rule,
public
forum,
private
sponsor,
end
of
issue,
because
it
did
say
that
these
are
not
automatically
determinative.
why
should
we
find
a
legal
error
on
the
record
that
we
have,
including
the
court's
opinion?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
then
saying
that
the
reasonable
observer
test
is
passed
here,
or
are
you...
as
distinct
from
saying
that
it
need
not
be
applied?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
it
meets
the
test.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
not
saying
that
the
test
is
irrelevant
to
the
decision
of
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
renner--
--are
you
arguing...
and
i
hadn't
perceived
this
before...
that
because
the
government
has
in
the
past
customarily
used
this
area
to
display
its
messages,
therefore
a
reasonable
observer
would
say
if
the
message
is
displayed
there,
it
must
be
the
government's?
if
so,
what
are
the
other
messages
that...
or
displays
that
the
government
has
placed
there
that
would
lead
to
that
inference?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
mentioned
such
as,
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
picky,
but
do
we
get
beyond
such
as?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
thermometer
always
comes
up,
but
is
there
anything
else?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
means
the
christmas
tree,
it
means
the
thermometer,
and
i
guess
after
allegheny
it
means
the
menorah
next
to
the
christmas
tree.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
menorah
may
or
may
not
be
identified
with
the
government--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
do
we
have
any
other
factual
premises
from
which
to
draw
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
wolman,
that's
what
i
thought
you
had
been
getting
at
before,
and
i
guess
you've
relinquished
this
position
if
it
was
yours,
but
let
me
just
put
it
forward
and
get
your
response
to
it.
let's
assume
that
we
do
have
something
like
a
lamb's
chapel
situation.
it
seems
to
me
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
lamb's
chapel
situation
is
that
the
use
that
has
been
allowed
of
the
public
facilities,
whatever
they
may
be,
has
been
sufficiently
nonselective
and
universal
that
sort
of
everybody
knows
that
there
is
no
endorsement
implication
when
suddenly
a
religious
group
comes
along
and
says,
yes,
we
want
to
have
a
meeting
in
this
room,
too.
i
thought
you
were
leaving
open
the
door,
however,
to
a
situation
in
which
the
religious
use
is
in
some
visual
or
some
other
way
so
remarkable,
or
so
different
from,
in
some
sense
different
from
the
prior
nonreligious
uses,
that
somebody
would
not
necessarily
know
that
there
was
no
endorsement
here.
and
in
a
case
like
that,
i
thought
you
were
leaving
the
door
open
to
a
reasonable
observer
kind
of
analysis,
and
i
thought,
so
in
that
sense
you're
allowing
a
case-by-case,
or
the
possibility
of
a
case-by-case
exception,
even
though
you
accept
as
a
general,
or
propose
as
a
general
rule
the
lamb's
chapel
analysis.
did
i
misunderstand
you
in
that
respect?
justice
david
h.
souter
on
the
same
rules
that
every
other
display
is
permitted.
in
other
words,
you're
saying
everybody's
got
to
play
by
the
same
rules.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
as
far
as
you
go,
isn't
it?
