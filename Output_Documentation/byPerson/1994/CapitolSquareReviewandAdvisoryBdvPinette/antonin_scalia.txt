justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
renner,
could
you...
i'm
not
clear
as
to
what
kind
of
unattended
displays
were
permitted
under
ohio's
law.
did
they
have
to
be
related
to
christmas
or
hanukkah?
it
was
only
during
the
holiday
season,
i
understand,
but
during
that
season,
could
the
libertarian
party
have
put
up
a
display?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
was
that
content
limitation
on
unattended
displays.
the
only
unattended
displays
you
were
going
to
allow
were
those
whose
message
pertained
to
the
holidays,
and
none
others.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
purely
religious.
i'm
talking
about
anything
else.
can
you
limit
your
permission
for
unattended
displays
to
just
those
that
have
to
do
with
the
holiday
season
and
for
all
other
purposes
no
one
can
have
an
unattended
display?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
libertarian
party
could
have
put
up
an
unattended
display.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
now,
why
wouldn't
the
state
be
worried
that
people
would
think
the
state
was
endorsing
the
libertarian
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
can
endorse
the
libertarian
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
want
to
be
a
real
ohioan
you
should
support
the
libertarian
party?
they
can
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
really
can
support
a
particular
political
party
officially
and
say
you're
not...
you
know
you're
not
a
patriotic
ohioan
if
you
don't
vote
libertarian?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wasn't
aware
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
wouldn't
worry...
but
in
any
case,
you
wouldn't
worry
about
that
being
identified
with
the
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
allowing
it
up
in
front
of
the
state
building?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
the
nazi
party
did
it
i
guess
the
legislature
wouldn't
worry
about
the
nazi
party
display
being
associated
with
the
state,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
they
have
this
regulation
that
you
say
permits
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
it's
lawful
or
not,
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
the
members
of
the
ohio
legislature
wouldn't
worry
about
the
nazi
party
being
associated
with
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
they
don't
worry
about
it
with
the
nazi
party,
i
don't
know
why
they
would
worry
about
it
with
the
kkk
or
with
a
cross,
or
with
a
religious
symbol.
it
just
seems
implausible
to
me
that
they
are
really
worried
about
the
state
being
identified
with
the
messages
that
they're
allowing
to
be
put
there.
why
would
they
worry
about
it
with
religion
and
not
with
other
things?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
worried
about
it
whether
it's...
it
is
in
the
first
amendment,
but
you
also
have
to
establish
a
risk
of
identification,
and
if
there's
a
real
risk
of
identification,
i
doubt
whether
the
ohio
legislature
would
say,
anybody
with
any
sort
of
an
unpleasant
message
can
stick
it
up
in
front
of
our
statehouse.
if
they
were
really
worried
about
identification,
i
doubt
whether
they'd
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
renner,
there's
just
something
that's
inconsistent
with
the
defense
that
ohio
comes
up
with.
you're
here
representing
ohio,
you're
an
assistant
attorney
general
for
ohio,
and
you're
saying,
this
is
a
terrible
thing
if
somebody
puts
up
a
sign
in
this
location
people
will
think
that
it
represents
the
views
of
the
state,
but
it's
the
state
that
has
invited
people
to
put
up
signs
here.
if
you
really
were
worried
about
people
confusing
private
messages
to
the
state's
message,
you
could
have
established
this
location
for
signs
somewhere
else.
but
to
say
that,
put
it
up
here,
and
then
say,
however,
not
religious
ones
here
because
someone
might
confuse
that
message
with
our
message,
well,
why
weren't
you
worried
about
that
for
all
other
messages?
i
don't
understand
that.
that
doesn't
seem
reasonable
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
that
any
display
could
go
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
close
it
to
the
public
forum
and
you
would
have
no
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
seem
reasonable
to
me
to
both
do
it
and
then
come
in
complaining
about
people's
messages
being
mistaken
for
those
of
the
state
when
you
have
invited
people,
all
people,
not
just
religious
groups
but
all
people
to
come
in
and
stick
their
message
up
in
front
of
the
statehouse.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wolman,
is
this
an
all-purpose
public
forum
at
all
times?
that
is,
as
i
understood
it,
unattended
displays
have
only
been
allowed
during
the
holiday
season.
am
i
correct
in
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
said
unattended
displays.
i
assume
these
merchants
did
not
walk
away
and
leave
their
wares
just
sitting
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
i
mean,
you
think
that's
an
innocuous
limitation?
an
innocuous
limitation
is
a
limitation
to
only...
that
kind
of
speech
that
the
state
likes?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
absolutely
the
worst
kind
of
limitation.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wolman,
i
confess
not
to
understand
your
argument,
how
you
wish
us
to
decide
this
case.
i
had
thought
that
the
principle
you
would
espouse
was
the
lamb's
chapel
principle,
that
if
the
state
does
this
for
all
others
it
is
no
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
to
treat
religion
the
same
way
as
others.
is
that
what
you're
appealing
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you've
mentioned
some
case-by-case
evaluation.
how
does
that
fit
with
case-by-case
evaluation?
do
you
want
us
to
evaluate,
case
by
case,
whether
there's
too
much
identification
with
the
statehouse,
or
do
you
want
us
to
simply
say,
if
you
do
it
for
everybody
else,
you
have
to
do
it
for
religion?
which
is
the
approach
you're
urging?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
necessarily.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
maybe
if
i
thought
this
is
too
closely
associated
with
the
state
capitol,
i...
it's
just
a
factual
matter,
whether
i
think
the
crosses
are
too
close
to
the
capitol,
and
if
they
are,
then
even
though
you're
allowing
other
speech,
the
cross
can
be
excluded.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
exclusions.
then
it
is
not
a
case-by-case
evaluation
you're
urging
on
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is,
or
it
isn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
exclusion.
i'm
not
talking
about...
let's
leave
time,
place,
and
manner
out
of
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
allow
others
to
do
it,
you're
saying
you
have
to
allow
crosses
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you've
retracted
the
answer
you
gave
me,
in
other
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
one
or
the
other.
we're
not
talking
about
time,
place,
and
manner.
we're
talking
about,
having
made
the
determination
that
you
let
other
people
do
it,
must
you
let
religious
people
do
it,
and
i
thought
your
answer
to
me
was
yes,
but
you're
answer
to
justice
souter--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
not
necessarily.
if
it's,
you
know,
a
reasonable
observer
would
confuse
it
with
the
state,
then
you
don't
have
to
let
them
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
means
there
would
be
no
content
regulation.
does
that
mean,
under
the
history
of
this
particular
public
forum,
that
if
i
came
in
and
asked
you
for
an
injunction
requiring
you
to
allow
me
to
put
up
a
sign,
"vote
for
ceorge
bush",
someone
that
ohio
did
not
endorse,
they
would
have
to
allow
that
sign
in
that
forum?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
could,
we
must.
i
think
i
see
what
you're
getting
at.
you
regard
the
unattended
as
a
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction.
you're
saying
you
have
to
allow
people
to
march
and
picket
and
assemble
and
protest
there,
but
you
don't
have
to
allow
unattended
displays,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
a
time,
place...
that's
a
manner
restriction.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
it
also
your
position,
in
answer
to
justice
souter
and
me,
that
the
state
could
place
a
manner
restriction
only
upon
religious
displays
out
of
establishment
clause
concerns?
that
is,
everybody
else
can
have
an
unattended
display,
but
if,
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
there's
too
much
of
a
risk
of
associating
it
with
the
capitol,
religious
groups
cannot
have
unattended
displays.
is
that
what
you
were
saying
to
justice
souter?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
permitted.
they
just
have
to
be
attended,
that's
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
they're
just
doing
it
because
they
just
don't
like
the
kkk
thing.
it
gets
a
lot
of
their
citizens
mad,
and
they
say,
well,
if
we
let
everybody
else
do
it,
we
have
to
let
the
kkk
do
it,
and
it's
not
worth
it.
we're
just
not
going
to
have
any
unattended
displays.
can
they
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
in
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
capitol
square
is
a
ten
acre
plaza
surrounding
the
state
capitol
in
columbus,
ohio.
it
is
a
traditional
public
forum
that
for
over
a
century
has
been
used
for
public
speeches,
gatherings
and
celebrations,
both
secular
and
religious.
state
law
gives
an
agency
called
the
capitol
square
review
and
advisory
board,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
responsibility
for
regulating
use
of
this
square.
in
recent
years
such
diverse
groups
as
homosexual
rights
organization,
the
ku
klux
klan
and
the
united
way
have
held
rallies
in
the
square.
the
board
has
also
permitted
a
variety
of
unattended
displays,
a
state-sponsored
lighted
tree
during
the
christmas
season,
for
example,
a
privately
sponsored
menorah
during
chanukah,
a
display
showing
the
progress
of
the
united
way
campaign
and
booths
and
exhibits
during
an
arts
festival.
in
november
1993,
the
board
received
an
application
from
the
ohio,
ku
klax
klan
to
place
across
on
the
square
during
the
christmas
season.
it
denied
that
application
on
the
ground
that
permitting
the
display
would
violate
the
establishment
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
ohio
klan
through
its
leader
vincent
pinette,
who
is
the
respondent
here,
filed
the
present
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio,
seeking
an
injunction,
requiring
the
board
to
issue
the
requested
permit.
the
district
court
granted
that
injunction
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
the
state’s
petition
for
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit.
private
religious
speech
is
as
fully
protected
under
the
free
speech
clause
as
private
secular
expression.
in
a
traditional
or
a
designated
public
forum
like
capitol
square,
a
state
may
regulate
expressive
content
and
religious
content
is
at
issue
here,
only
if
such
a
restriction
is
necessary
and
narrowly
drawn
to
serve
a
compelling
state
interest.
petitioners
assert
only
one
justification
for
closing
capitol
square
to
respondent’s
cross,
namely
the
state’s
compelling
interest
in
avoiding
official
endorsement
of
christianity,
as
required
by
the
establishment
clause.
we
find
that
interest
not
to
be
implicated
here.
twice
previously
in
cases
called
lamb's
chapel,
v.
center
moriches
school
district
and
widmar
v.
vincent,
we
have
addressed
the
combination
of
private
religious
expression,
a
forum
available
for
public
use
and
the
state’s
interest
in
complying
with
the
establishment
clause.
both
times,
we
struck
down
the
attempted
discriminatory
exclusion
of
private
religious
speech.
petitioners
tried
to
distinguish
those
cases
by
arguing
the
capitol
squares’
proximity
to
the
seat
of
government,
may
produce
the
perception
that
the
cross
bears
the
state’s
approval.
they
urges
to
apply
the
endorsement
test
used
by
some
of
our
recent
decision
and
to
find
that
because
an
observer
seeing
across
with
the
state
capitol
behind
it,
might
mistake
private
expression
for
officially
endorsed
religious
expression,
the
state’s
content
based
restriction
of
religious
speech
is
constitutional.
seven
of
the
justices
reject
that
conclusion,
four
because
the
endorsement
test
is
not
applicable
and
three
because
there
has
been
no
endorsement.
the
reminder
of
my
summation
refers
to
the
four
justice
plurality
opinion
in
which
is
i
am
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
kennedy
and
justice
thomas,
holding
that
the
so
called
endorsement
test
does
not
apply.
the
cases
which
support
the
existence
of
an
endorsement
test
in
our
establishment
clause
jurisprudence,
involved
either
religious
expression
by
the
government
itself,
as
in
lynch
v.
donnelly
which
involved
a
crèche
erected
by
a
municipality
or
they
involved
government
action
that
allegedly
discriminated
in
favor
of
private
religious
expression
as
in
allegheny
county
v.
aclu,
which
involved
preferential
placement
of
a
privately
constructed
crèche
on
county
property.
this
case
involves
neither
government
speech
nor
government
favoring
of
certain
private
speech
or
is
it
an
issue
of
purely
private
expression
occurring
in
a
public
forum
open
to
all
speakers
on
equal
terms.
we
have
consistently
held
that
it
is
no
violation
for
government
to
enact
neutral
policies
that
happen
to
benefit
religion.
here
the
only
action
by
the
state
is
the
maintenance
of
capitol
square
as
a
public
forum
with
a
neutral
access
policy.
the
test
petitioner
has
proposed,
would
appropriately
be
called
not
an
endorsement,
but
a
transferred
endorsement
test,
attributing
to
a
neutrally
behaving
government,
private
religious
expression,
simply
because
some
people
might
mistake
it
for
sectarian
government
expression.
such
a
test
has
no
antecedent
in
our
jurisprudence
and
would
work
considerable
mischief
by
forcing
public
officials
to
guess
about
the
constitutionality
of
every
proposed
active
private
religious
expression
in
a
public
forum.
moreover
since
the
principal
of
transformed
endorsement
cannot
be
limited
to
public
forum
cases,
it
would
also
permit
challenges
to
perfectly
neutral
grand
programs
for
example,
where
participation
of
religious
groups
or
entities
might
create
the
appearance,
though
there
is
no
reality
of
endorsement.
if
the
state
guesses
wrong
in
one
direction,
it
is
guilty
of
an
establishment
clause
violation.
if
in
the
other,
it
is
liable
for
suppressing
free
exercise
or
free
speech
a
risk
not
run
when
the
state
restrains
only
its
own
expression
and
not
private
expression,
it
would
be
irresponsible
to
make
to
make
the
nation’s
legislatures
walk
such
a
minefield.
if
ohio
is
concerned
about
misperceptions,
nothing
prevents
it
from
requiring
all
private
displays
in
the
square
to
be
identified
as
such,
but
the
state
may
not
on
the
claim
of
misperception
of
official
endorsement,
ban
all
private
religious
speech
from
the
public
square
or
discriminate
against
it
by
requiring
religious
speech
alone
to
disclaim
public
sponsorship.
the
plurality
thus
concludes
that
religious
expression
cannot
violate
the
establishment
clause,
where
one,
it
is
purely
private
and
two,
it
occurs
in
a
traditional
or
designated
public
forum,
publicly
announced
and
open
to
all
on
equal
terms.
those
conditions
are
satisfied
here,
and
therefore,
the
state
may
not
bar
respondent’s
cross
from
capitol
square.
justice
thomas
who
is
one
of
the
plurality
has
also
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
souter
and
breyer
joined.
justice

has
filed
an

concurring
in

in
