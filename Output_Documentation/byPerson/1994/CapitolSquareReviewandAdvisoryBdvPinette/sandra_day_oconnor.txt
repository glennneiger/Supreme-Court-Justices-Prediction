justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
the
capitol
square
a
public
forum,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
accept
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
as
i
understand
it,
at
one
time
the
board
here
had
adopted
a
regulation
saying
that
all
displays
on
the
square
had
to
be
attended
by
someone.
wasn't
that
the
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
unattended
displays
permitted
at
the
christmas
season?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
would
have
been
a
content-neutral
sort
of
a
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
board
could
certainly
adopt
that
as
a
policy,
couldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
also,
i
suppose,
could
designate
a
certain
part
of
the
capitol
square
where
it
would
allow
displays
by
different
groups.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
hasn't
attempted
to
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
withdrew
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
the
board
permitted
other
groups
to
have
displays
in
the
capitol
square
area
during
the
holiday
season?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
any
other
groups?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
has
the
board
denied
access
to
capitol
square
to
groups
other
than
the
kkk?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
one
last
question.
i
understand
that
the
cross
that
was
erected
or
proposed
to
be
erected
and
in
fact
was
by
the
kkk
here
had
a
disclaimer
attached
to
it
saying
it
was
not
a
display
of
the
government.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
of
course,
the
board
could
have
required
other
types
of
disclaimers
on
more
permanent
material
if
it
chose,
could
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
a
reasonable
person
know
how
to
read,
though,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
think
so,
and
they
can
read
the
disclaimer,
can
they
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
think
your
argument
is
so
farfetched
it's
just
hard
to
bring
it
down
to
reality,
to
the
real
world.
here
is
this
thing
with
a
sign
that
says,
this
isn't
government
sponsored--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
board
has
every
power
to
protect
itself
by
any
reasonable
regulation,
and
yet
it
comes
here
arguing
for
this
remarkable
proposition
to
suppress
speech
in
a
discriminatory
fashion.
i
just
think
your
argument
falls
short
of
what
this
court's
cases
have
required.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
wolman,
do
you
concede
that
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
regulations
can
be
adopted
by
the
board,
or
the
city--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
the
use
of
this
area?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
one
such
possibility
be
no
unattended
displays?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
suppose
they
could
designate
a
certain
smaller
area
of
the
open
space
for
use
by
anyone
who
has
a
display.
