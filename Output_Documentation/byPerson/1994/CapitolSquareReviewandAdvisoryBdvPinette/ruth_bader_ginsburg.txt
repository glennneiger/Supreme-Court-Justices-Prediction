justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
take
it
your
argument
today
is
that
the
menorah
would
have
to
fall
in
the
same
category
as
the
cross.
your
opening
statement
was
that
no
religious
symbol,
and
yet
ohio
itself
made
the
distinction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
i
take
it
from
your
opening
statement
at
this
argument
that
you
have
now
reconsidered
and
you...
i
thought
you
said
in
the
beginning
of
your
argument
that
no
religious
symbol
could
be
in
front
of
a
building
that
is
identified
with
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
renner,
can
you
clarify,
because
the
record
at
one
point
refers
to
this
as
a
10-acre
area,
and
in
another
place
it's
just
one
block.
what
are
we
talking
about?
what
is
this
area,
and
how
close
is
the
association?
how
close
are
these
symbols?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolman,
do
you
believe
the
establishment
clause
has
nothing
to
say
here?
you
have
answered
the
question
so
far
that
you
can't
distinguish
between
the
political
message
and
the
religious
message,
certainly
not
one
religion
and
another.
mr.
renner
seemed
to
be
saying,
well,
we
have
to
be
a
little
extra
concerned
about
the
endorsement
notion
because
there's
an
establishment
clause
that
we
have
to
do
something
with.
how
do
you
fit
the
establishment
clause
into
the
way
you
view
this
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
could
we
bring
it
down
to
this
case,
and
to
make
it
concrete,
if
you
can
focus
your
attention
on
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
the
kaplan
case,
and
there
judge
feinburg
and
one
of
his
colleagues
thought
that
no
viewer...
in
that
case
it
happened
to
be
a
menorah.
it
could
have
been
cross...
no
viewer,
seeing
this
religious
symbol
in
front
of
the
city
hall,
could
reasonably
think
that
it
was
there
without
the
approval
of
the
government.
now,
we're
not
taking
there
the
statement
of
a
dolt
who
is
not
acquainted
with
public
forum
law,
but
two
respected
judges
from
the
second
circuit,
and
what
do
we
make
of
that
reaction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
didn't
ask
to
have
this
placed
in
the
particular
place.
you
put
it
where
you
were
told
to
put
it,
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
wouldn't
have
any...
you
didn't
say,
we
must
have
it
at
this
location.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
far
as
the
location
and
the
size
of
the
sign,
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--could
it
have?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
it
have
said,
we
want
this
sign
to
be
not
of
cardboard,
we
want
it
to
be
legible,
large
letters...
could
it
have
said
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
size
of
the
religious
symbol?
could
the
state
have
said,
we
will
allow
these
symbols
but
not
so
that
they
overwhelm
the
space,
or
dictate
a
limit
on
the
size?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well--
--then
you
are
saying
the
establishment
clause
doesn't
operate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
relevant,
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
you
said,
if
everything
is
the
same,
the
establishment
clause
doesn't
apply
to
all
speech.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
could
you
give
me
an
instance
where
you
could
ban
a
religious
symbol,
but
could
not
ban
the
thermometer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
you
could
ban
the
klan
cross,
but
you
could
not
ban
the
red
cross,
which
people
i
think
don't
associate
with
religion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then,
the
establishment
clause
you
say
really
doesn't
bear
on
this
problem.
