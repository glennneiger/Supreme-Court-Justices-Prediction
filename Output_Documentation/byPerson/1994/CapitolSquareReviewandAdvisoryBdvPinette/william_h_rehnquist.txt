chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-780,
capitol
square
review
and
advisory
board
v.
vincent
j.
pinette.
mr.
renner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
renner,
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
at
the
very
seat
of
government?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
it
have
to
be
located,
say,
at
least
in
a
county
seat?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
when
you
say
the
seat
of
government,
you're
not
talking
about
a
geographical
location
of
a
capital
or
a
county
seat.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
really
mean,
then,
anything
more
than
a
government
building?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--wasn't
there
testimony
in
the
record
here
from
a
rabbi
that
said
that
a
menorah
was
a
religious
symbol?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
an
opinion
of
the
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
it
command
the
votes
of
five
justices?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
the
reasonable
observer
be
expected
to
know?
would
the
reasonable
observer
be
expected
to
know
everything
that
had
been
displayed,
say
for
the
last
12
months,
the
last
5
years?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
far
was
it
from
high
street?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
the
menorah
fare
under
your
reasonable
observer
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your...
not
what
some
plurality
opinion
of
this
court
might
say,
but
under
the
reasonable
observer
test.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nonetheless,
the
board
approved
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
renner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wolman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
a
perfectly
valid
regulation
can
be
passed
from
a
number
of
motives,
and
it
seems
to
me
if
the
state
decides,
you
know,
we're
getting
a
lot
of
flack
from
people
who
see
this
klan
display
up
here
of
the
cross,
and
we're
taking
heat
from
it,
and
we
realize
we
can't
just
ban
the
klan's
cross,
but
we're
going
to
ban
everything
and
just
avoid
the
problem.
why
would
that
raise
a
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
an
ad
hoc
willy
nilly
judgment.
i'm
talking
about
a
state
decision
that
we
are
simply
not
going
to
have
any
unattended
displays
at
any
time
in
the
future.
it's
pulling
in
the
limits
of
the
forum.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
was
attended.
[laughter]
i
don't
wish
to
make
you
retravel
ground
you've
already
traveled,
but
i
am
still
not
clear
as
to
your
answer
whether
or
not
at
this
juncture
the
state
could
say,
because
there
is
highly
unpopular
speech
attended
to
the
ku
klux
klan
symbol,
we
are
enacting
a
rule,
no
unattended
symbols.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wolman,
supposing
you
have
not
the
state
capitol
in
columbus,
where
you
have
10
acres,
but
a
state
capitol
which
has
a
much,
much
smaller
grounds,
and
they've
got
some
beautiful
flowers
planted
there,
and
they
say,
you
know,
we're
not
having
any
displays
here
at
all
on
these
grounds.
there's
a
capital
park
across
the
street
that
you
can
go
to,
but
we
just
don't
have
any
displays,
attended
or
unattended,
on
these
grounds.
is
that
permissible?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
why
can't
ohio
return
to
that
sort
of
a
thing
even
though
previously
it
wasn't?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
said
they
can
never
get
out
of
their
public
forum.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
they
just
have
a
content-neutral
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
we
have
to
inquire
into
their
motive
why
they
have
a
content-neutral
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
94-780,
capitol
square
review
and
advisory
board
v.
pinette
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
