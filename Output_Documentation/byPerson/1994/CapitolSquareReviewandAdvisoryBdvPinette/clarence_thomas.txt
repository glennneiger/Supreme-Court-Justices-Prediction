--mr.
wolman...
i
hate
to
interrupt
you,
but
i'd
like
to
ask
just
a
couple
of
questions,
if
i
may.
you
say
that
this
is
a
religious
symbol.
what
is
the
religion
of
the
klan?
justice
clarence
thomas
but
i
think
the
argument...
the
reason
i
ask
is
so
much
of
the
argument
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
this
cross
is
a
religious
symbol.
now,
is
there
testimony
to
the
effect
that
it
is
a
religious
symbol.
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
if
it
has
a...
and
i
don't
know
what
the
mix
is.
let's
say,
50-50,
50
whatever
other
reasons,
and
50
religious,
then
how
does
that
become
a
free
exercise
problem?
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
i
mean,
it's
a
problem
in
this
case.
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
now,
with
that
said,
what
is...
what
does
a
burning
cross
symbolize?
justice
clarence
thomas
so
there
are
some
people...
as
i
understand
the
record,
there
were
some
concerns
that
some
of
the
citizens
of
columbus,
when
they
saw
that,
could
actually
see
fire
on
that
cross.
justice
clarence
thomas
that's
right.
justice
clarence
thomas
but
doesn't
the
record
suggest,
though,
that
there
was
some
concern
that
people
would
see
more
than
the
religious
symbol
in
that
cross?
justice
clarence
thomas
but
that
message
doesn't
implicate
the
establishment
clause.
justice
clarence
thomas
do
you
think
that
the
political...
with
respect
to
the
cross,
that
the
political
message
for
the
klan
overwhelms
the
religious
free
exercise
considerations,
that
if
someone...
if
i
said
that
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan
is
carrying
a
cross
down
pennsyivania
avenue,
would
the
average
person,
or
the
reasonable
person,
think
that
that,
that
the
klan
is
engaged
in
an
exercise
of
religion,
or
a
political
statement?
justice
clarence
thomas
so
we're
shoe-horning
a
political
case
into
the
religious
component
of
the
first
amendment.
