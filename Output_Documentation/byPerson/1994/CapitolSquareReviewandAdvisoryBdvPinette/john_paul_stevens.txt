mr.
renner,
may
i
ask
the
other
side
of
the
coin
from
justice
scalia's
question?
do
you
understand
the
rule
in
the
sixth
circuit,
which
i
guess
there
was
a
case
arose
in
michigan
before
this
one,
to
make
it
necessary
for
the
state
to
permit
the
libertarian
party
to
put
up
a
sign
such
as
you
describe
if
they
want
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
understand
the
court
of...
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
require
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
said
it's
an
open--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
renner--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
one
question...
excuse
me.
i
just
want
to...
is
it
your
position
that
you
can
permit
the
menorah
while
denying
the
cross?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what
it
seemed
to
be,
and
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
it
wasn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
invited
anybody
to
put
a
message
up
whose
message
you
disagree
with?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
have
you
permitted
anybody
to
put
a
message
up
whose
message
you
disagree
with?
justice
john
paul
stevens
everything
you've
done
is
consistent
with
the
view--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
whenever
it's
there
you...
people
will
think
you
endorse
it,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
are
you...
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
that
content-based...
supposing
the
state
regarded
the
capitol
grounds
as
something
like
a
very
giant
bulletin
board
that
they
put
in
their
front
hall.
could
they
not
say,
we
will
only
allow
messages
to
go
up
there
that
the
state
in
general
endorses,
like
some
kind
of
a
poster
saying
don't
smoke,
or
don't
drink,
or
contribute
to
the
united
way,
and
so
forth,
things
like
that
that
are
not
very
controversial?
could
they
limit
the
forum
in
that
way,
by
content
but
only
those
things
the
state
thinks
are...
that
a
sound
public
policy,
it's
bipartisan
and
the
rest,
would
support?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
would
have
to
allow
that.
they'd
have
to
allow
political
campaigning
on
the...
by--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--has
that
ever
been
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
record
suggesting--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
can
they
abandon
the
public
forum?
can
they
terminate
the
public
forum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
every
city
square
in
every
state
in
the...
every
capitol
square
in
every
capital
in
the
united
states
a
public
forum,
and
if
not,
why
can't
ohio
say,
we
want
to
be
like
everybody
else,
and
not
make
it
a
public
forum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
your
position
on
that?
