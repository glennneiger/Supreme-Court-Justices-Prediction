mr.
michael
j.
renner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
attempt
to
preserve
several
minutes
for
rebuttal.
this
court
today
is
faced
with
a
factual
pattern
which
requires
the
analysis
of
the
friction
that
is
created
when
two
prongs
of
the
first
amendment
rub
against
each
other.
ohio
suggests
that
this
court
adopt
a
workable
rule
that
any
purely
religious
display
which
is
unattended
and
positioned
at
the
very
seat
of
government
should
be
considered
as
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
mr.
chief
justice,
the
seat
of
government
would
be
a
building
or
structure
from
which
the
public
realizes
the
power
of
government
does
its
work.
this
could
be
obviously
a
capital
building,
it
could
be
a
city
hall,
it
could
be
a
county
courthouse,
it
could
be
a
federal
building.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
i
am
not
aware...
well,
i
don't
think
there
are
any...
there
would
be
federal
post
office
buildings
that,
for
instance
in
cities
other
than
county
seats
which--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
we're
talking
about
a
facility
which
the
reasonable
observer,
the
public,
the
common
man,
would
associate
as
being
governmental
in
its
authority
and
from
which
governmental
activities
are
carried
out.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
probably
not,
your
honor.
there
are
probably
some
government
buildings
that
are
in
rented
office
structures,
for
instance,
and
which
the
reasonable
observer
might
not
recognize
the
building
as
that
of
government,
in
which
case
our
rule
would
not
carry
the
same
weight.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
reasonable
observer
does
understand
that
assemblies,
demonstrations,
speeches
and
rallies
take
place
at
the
seat
of
government
frequently,
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
justice
o'connor,
the
capitol
square
has
been
recognized...
certainly
the
state
of
ohio's
capitol
square
has
been
recognized
as
a
public
forum.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
we
accept
that
it
is
a
public
forum,
your
honor,
but
if
i
could
explain
that
just
because
it
is
a
public
forum
doesn't
mean
that
unattended
displays
are
recognized
as
being
anything
other
than
a
governmental
display.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
i
believe
there
was--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--well,
that's
correct.
i
think
the
tenor
of
the
resolution
was
there
would
be
no
displays
at
the
statehouse
grounds,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
we
would
certainly
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
that
would
be
correct
also,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
it
didn't
attempt
to
adopt
that...
it
adopted
the
regulation
you
first
suggested,
but
did
not--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--adopt
the
regulation,
the
second--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--yes.
i
guess
i
have
to
answer
yes
your
honor,
because
the
state
itself
has
a
holiday
display.
the
state
owns
the
holiday
display.
it
owns
the
christmas
tree.
as
part
of
a
previous
holiday,
several
previous
holiday
displays,
it
has
allowed
the
petition
of
one
of
the
jewish
branches
in
the
city
to
erect
a
menorah
in
conjunction
with
that
holiday
display.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
the
united
way
at
one
time
requested
the
state
to
have
positioned
in
front
of
the
state
capitol
building
a
thermometer
showing
the
progress
of
the
united
way
campaign
in
the
community,
which
the
state
readily
approved.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
your
honor,
other
than
the
ones
that
you
and
i
have
just
discussed,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
petitions
for
unattended
displays
on
the
statehouse
grounds.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
there's
a
photograph
attached
to
the
documents
presented
to
the
court
of
the
disclaimer.
it
was
of
a
cardboard
nature
which
did
receive
immediate
wind
damage,
but
it
was
there.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
there
is
an
infinite
variety
of
potential
disclaimers
that
could
be
employed.
you're
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
justice
souter,
the
reason
that
we
believe
that
there
was
legal
error
in
the
sixth
circuit
is
because,
though
there
were
various
portions
of
the
sixth
circuit
decision
which
address
other
factors...
it
even
mentioned
the
enforcement
analysis...
the
court
still
pronounced
as
its
conclusion
that
any
private
speech
in
a
public
forum
is
permissible.
it
didn't
say,
any
private
speech
which
doesn't
impact
reasonable
observers
in
a
negative
way
or
in
a
positive
way
with
regard
to
their
understanding
of
the
religious
nature.
it
didn't
say,
any
private
speech
that's
accompanied
by
a
disclaimer.
it
just
said,
as
its
conclusion,
that
any
private
speech
in
a
public
forum
is
appropriate
speech
regardless
of
its
content.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
justice
scalia,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
the
display
that
was
permitted
at
the
statehouse
ground
involved
a
long
tradition
of
ohio's
owned
and
operated
christmas
tree.
once
various
courts
of
this
land,
including
our
own
sixth
circuit,
and
some
analysis
by
this
court
in
the
allegheny
case,
determined
that
a
holiday
display
which
included
both
a
christmas
tree
and
the
menorah
was
not
a
purely
religious
display
but
had
a
holiday
connotation,
ohio
followed
that
pronouncement
and
permitted
the
erection
of
the
menorah.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
well--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--you're
correct,
justice
scalia,
the
state,
of
course,
which
was
making
its
decisions
under
the
guidance
of
court
determinations,
had
concluded
that
it
would
be
an
establishment
clause
violation
to
allow
purely
religious
displays
to
be
exhibited.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
oh,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
if
in
fact
displays
are
going
to
be
permitted
in
the
public
forum,
we
think
the
state
probably
has
the
right
to
say,
no
displays
may
be
presented.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
but
if
displays
are
going
to
be
presented--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--then
the
free
speech
and
equal
access
provisions
would
require
us
to
provide
them
to
all
speech
content.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
that
would
be
my
under...
as
long
as
it
were
not
purely
religious,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
they
might
be,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
well,
there's
no
proscription
in
the
constitution
that
the
state
may
not
be
involved--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--i'm
not
aware
of
a
restriction.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
well,
i
would
hope
that
they
wouldn't,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
it's
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
well
i--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--well,
as
i'm
standing
here,
your
honor,
i'm
trying
to
think
of
what
proscription
in
the
constitution
or
the
bill
of
rights
which
would
proscribe
that.
it
certainly
would
not
be
an
establishment
clause
proscription.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
well--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--as
the
attorneys
for
the
state
of
ohio
we
would
certainly
want
to
review
all
other
constitutional
provisions
and
statutes.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
your
honor,
to
say
that
they
wouldn't
worry
about
it
would
be
disingenuous.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
that's
correct.
the
regulation
would
not...
the
regulation
which
we
have
advised
the
board
to
work
under
would
not
proscribe
forms
of
speech
other
than
those
that
violate
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
well,
i
hope
that
it
would
be
because,
your
honor,
that
religion
has
a
specific
qualification
in
the
first
amendment,
and
i
would
hope
that
the
state
worries
about
the
things
that
their
attorneys
suggest
that
they
worry--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--your
honor,
i
think
i
would
agree
with
your
analysis.
as
the
record
below
indicates,
the
state
did
struggle
considerably
with
the
notion
of
allowing
the
ku
klux
klan
to
rally
or
put
up
displays
at
the
statehouse,
but
they
did
permit
them
to
rally.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
no,
i
don't
understand
it
that
way,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--it
would
require
that
if
in
fact
those
forums
of
speeches
were
allowed
to
others.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
i
think
the
state
of
ohio
could
proscribe
all
unattended
displays,
but
i
think
once
speech
is
opened
up,
the
only
way
that
the
state
of
ohio
could
forbid
any
speech
is
if
it
were
a
violation
of
some
other
constitutional
provision.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
and
that's
what
we
assert
is
the
problem
here
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
there
was,
your
honor,
and
he
testified
quite
vehemently
that
it
was
a
purely
religious
symbol,
as
viewed
by
members
of
his
faith.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
it
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
that
ohio
made
the
distinction,
but
it
was
based
on
directives
that
ohio
felt
had
been
provided
to
it
by
superior
courts.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
that
is
our
belief,
justice
ginsburg.
we
are
still,
however,
living
with
a
decision
that,
as
we
read
the
allegheny
county
case,
that
says
that
the
menoran
is
not
a
purely
religious
symbol.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
it
was
in
the
opinion--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--i
do
not
believe
that
it
did,
your
honor.
it
was
in
the
opinion
of
justice
blackmun,
who
of
course
read
the
opinion
for
the
court,
but
i
don't
believe
that
section
of
it
did
command
the
five
votes.
it
is,
however,
the
guidance
that
the
state
of
ohio
has
worked
with
since
it
was
rendered.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
believe
it's
necessary.
i
think
that
our
result
is
achieved
whether
we
use
the
analysis
of
the
endorsement
test
and
use
the
analysis
of
a
reasonable
observer,
or
if
we
use
the
analysis
of
lee
v.
weisman,
in
which
there
was
an
indirect,
coercive
effect
because
of
the
mandatory
nature
of
subjecting
the
school
students
to
the
prayer.
this
is
very
much
like
that
because
the
placement
of
this
cross
will
automatically
require
many
thousands
of
citizens
to
view
this
message,
the
message
of
the
cross
superimposed
upon
the
state
capitol
building,
so--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--if
it
were
a
fact
that
nobody,
or
no
reasonable
people
would
associate
the
state
of
ohio--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--i'm
saying,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
it
requires
that
analysis.
i
think...
i
think
that
analysis
supports
the
result
we
urge
upon
the
court,
because
we
think
that
a
reasonable
observer
under
these
circumstances,
with
a
message
as
powerful
as
that
of
an
unattended
cross
in
the
presence
of
the
state
capitol
building,
that
there
would
be
countless
reasonable
observers
who
would
be
connecting
those
two
images--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--but
it
doesn't
require
that.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
the
answer
to
that
question,
i
think,
your
honor,
lies
in
the
decision
of
lee
v.
weisman
in
which
the
reasonable
observer
analysis
was
not
required
either,
but--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--well,
i
would
invite
the
court
to
consider
the
parallels,
because
it
was
in
that
case,
after
all,
private
speech
that
was
rendered
by
the
rabbi
that
was
in
question.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
well,
i
think
the
court
concluded
it
was
state-sponsored
by
some
fact
patterns
that
connected
the
rabbi
with
the
message,
and
with
the
school
system
in
that
case,
that
the
rabbi
was
invited
by
the
school
system
to
give
the
benediction
and
the
invocation.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
it
has
not,
but
i
also
do
not
believe,
your
honor,
that
lee
v.
weisman
would
have
turned
on
a
situation
in
which
the
rabbi
called
up
the
school
and
said
that
my
daughter's
graduating,
may
i
present
the
invocation
for
the
school
system.
in
other
words,
if
there
was--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--well,
there
is
none,
and
we
would
suggest--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--we
have
conceded
that
it
is
a
public
forum
for
speeches
and
discussions.
we
would
emphasize
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
history
of
private
use
of
this
plot
of
ground
in
front
of
the
state
capitol
building
for
attended...
unattended
displays
other
than
those
which
were
approved
and
supported
by
the
state
government.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
oh,
i
think
if
we
apply
the
reasonable
observer
test,
which
we
encourage
this
court
to
do,
we
would
have
to
conclude
that
when
we
have
a
message
as
powerful
as
the
cross,
placed
in
front
of
a
building
that's
recognizable
as
the
state
government--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--that's
right.
well,
it
meets--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
the
rule
that
we
suggest
that
the
court
adopt,
whether
the
court
were
to
apply
the
endorsement
analysis
or
were
to
apply
the
indirect
coercion
analysis,
the
fact
patterns
would
result
in
this
conclusion.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
no,
obviously
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
reasonable
observer,
in
fact,
contrary
to
what
was
said
in
the
sixth
circuit,
that
a
reasonable
observer
knows
all
relevant
facts,
we
submit
that
a
reasonable
observer
is
a
common
man,
an
average
man
that
is
not
either
a
hypothetical
dolt,
as
suggested
in
the
sixth
circuit,
or
one
that--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--i
think
most
of
them
certainly
would.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
they
can
read
the
disclaimer
if,
justice
o'connor,
they're
close
enough
to
assemble
to
be
able
to
see
the
disclaimer.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
well--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--if
i
may,
justice
o'connor,
discuss
the
notion
of
the
reasonable
observer
who
can
read
and,
under
the
fact
patterns
of
this
case,
what
we
have
is
a
10-foot
high
cross
displayed
in
the
middle
of
the
statehouse
grounds
surrounded
by
8
to
10
25-story
or
higher
buildings
from
which
people
can
observe
this
scene
of
the
statehouse
and
the
cross
at
distances
far
greater
than
they
are
capable
of
reading
any
disclaimer.
this--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--your
honor,
i
will
try
to
describe
this
as
visually
as
i
can
paint
with
words.
the
capitol
square
is
nearly
a
square
parcel
of
land.
it
comprises
a
total
of
approximately
10
acres.
a
large
portion
of
that
is
consumed
directly
in
the
middle
by
the
state
capitol
building
of
the
state
of
ohio.
directly
to
its
east,
on
the
eastern
portion,
is
what
is
called
an
annex,
or
now
the
senate
office
building,
which
is
connected
to
that
and
uses
up
most
of
the
ground
to
the
east
of
the
building.
to
the
west
of
the
building
is
the
front
of
the
capitol.
it
faces
the
main
street
in
the
city
of
columbus,
and
it
is
probably
500
feet
in
width
and
probably
300
feet
from
the
street
to
the
capitol
building.
it
is
this
location
that
the
government
has
used
to
display
all
of
its
unattended
displays.
that's
where
our
statues
are,
where
our
flags
are,
where
our
unattended
messages
from
the
government
of
the
state
of
ohio
are
positioned,
and
it
is
in
this
area,
in
a
grassy
portion...
there
are
several
quadrants
surrounded
by
sidewalks,
grassy
portions
of
this
plaza.
in
the
middle
of
one
of
those
grassy
portions
is
where
the
cross
was
placed.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
approximately
100
feet,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
well,
your
honor,
first
of
all
i
would
refer
to
unattended
displays
that
were
put
up
there
on
a
temporary
basis,
such
as
the
united
way
thermometer.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
we
don't.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
we
don't
get
beyond
it,
your
honor.
the
history
of
unattended
displays
here
includes
those
permanently
displayed
by
the
government.
the
united
way--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
and
that--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--we
do
not,
and
if
i
might
add,
the
one
testimony
that
we
have
in
the
record
of
a
witness
called
by
the
respondents
indicated
that
when
he
viewed
the
thermometer,
he
viewed
this
as
government
support
for
the
thermometer.
our
premise
is
that
in
this
context,
in
this
location
which
is
so
predominantly
historically
a
place
where
government
displays
its
messages,
that
a
reasonable
observer
will
understand
a
message
to
be
related
to--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--the
menorah
has
been
suggested
to
us
by
courts
of
previous
jurisdiction--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--well,
under
the
reasonable
observer
test,
we
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
there
would
be
very
many
reasonable
observers
who
would
think
that
a
menorah
is
anything
other
than
a
purely
religious
symbol.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
the
board
approved
it,
your
honor,
as
described
before,
based
on
the
previous--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--well,
we
think
that
it
has
such
a
favored
location
on
a
prominent
position
of
governmental
property
that
the
only
conclusion
that
a
reasonable
observer
would
have
is
that
it's
approved
and
supported--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--by
the
government.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
that's
not
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
no.
our
position
is
that
we
have
permitted
the
menorah
based
on
helpful
suggestions
that
have
been
previously
rendered--
[laughter]
--that
the
menorah
is
not
purely
religious.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i'm
not
certain
that
the
state
has
ever
invited
the
use
of
this
property
for
displays,
but--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--i'm
saying
that
we,
based
on
analysis
of
equal
access,
that
we
would
not
deny
any
display
based
on
speech
content,
but
i
would
put
out
that
when
the
united
way
barometer
went
up,
it
went
up
with
the
approval
of
the
state
of
ohio,
and
people
saw
it
as
having
the
approval
of
the
state
of
ohio,
and
that
was
permissible
because
the
state
of
ohio
is
not
required
constitutionally
not
to
support
the
united
way.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
we're
not
required
to
do
that,
because
the
first
amendment
only
requires
us
to
forestall
from
participating
in
religious--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--i
don't
think
that's
an
accurate
description
of
what
the
state
of
ohio--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--i
don't
know
that
we've
ever
invited
anybody
to
put
a
message
up.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
we've
only
permitted
united
way--
mr.
michael
j.
renner
--no.
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i'd
like
to
preserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
your
honor,
i
want
you
to
instruct
the
sixth
circuit
that
if
they're
going
to
apply
a
reasonable
observer
test
and
a
public
forum
notion
they
still
must
determine
what
a
reasonable
observer
would
see
as
the
message
from
that
public
forum.
they
must
determine
whether
the...
is
this
a
state
message
or
a
private
message?
they
must
not
simply
assume
that
because
it's
in
a
private
forum
everybody...
in
a
public
forum,
everybody
is
going
to
know
it's
private
speech.
mr.
michael
j.
renner
thank
you,
your
honor.
