mr.
benson
a.
wolman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
has
chosen
to
recast
some
of
the
events
that
have
occurred
in
this
matter.
the
record
does
not
support
the
notion
that
the
menorah
and
the
united
way
thermometer
were
the
only
items
there.
the
district
judge
in
his
finding
of
fact
number
13
specifically
noted
that
the
united
way
thermometer
and
booths
and
arts
festival
displays,
in
addition
to
the
menorah
and
the
state's
tree,
were
examples.
that's
the
word
the
district
judge
used
based
on
his
findings,
based
on
his
familiarity
with
the
particular
setting.
what
is
before
the
court,
we
believe,
is
that
here
we
have
a
quintessential
public
forum,
a
public
forum
in
which
the
state
has
permitted
a
variety
of
displays,
and
those
displays
suddenly
the
state
chooses
to
confine.
suddenly
it
chooses
to
say,
my
client's
symbol
shall
not
be
there,
and
it
relies
upon
its
claim
of
establishment
clause.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
no,
justice
scalia.
in
fact,
the
record
here
reflects
that
such
things
as
the
arts
festival,
which
were
not
held
during
winter
weather,
and
which
there
were
displays
and
booths,
those,
for
instance,
were
in
the
summer,
and
there's
no--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--that
may
be
during
the
daytime,
but
the
unattended
displays
of
art
have
appeared
there
overnight.
those
are
not
just
fold
up
the
tents
and
leave.
nonetheless,
there
were...
the
united
way
display
was
to
the
best
of
everyone's
understanding
not
a
part
of
any
holiday
seasonal
display,
so
it
was
a
year-round
matter,
and
what
we
have
here
is
the
state
suddenly
announcing
a
new
rule,
a
new
rule
not
having
previously
precluded
any
display
from
being
there.
the
record
doesn't
reflect
any
given
instance
where
that
happened.
the
new
rule
we
think
clearly
violates
the
precedents
of
this
court
going
back
a
substantial
period,
and
even
in
the
modern
era,
larson
v.
valente
as
an
example,
where
the
court
had
held
that
where
there
might
be
a
compelling
interest
in
the
state
to
not
violate
the
establishment
clause,
nonetheless
the
state
has
a
duty
to
use
mechanisms,
mechanisms
so
as
to
preserve
freedom
of
expression,
mechanisms
that
are,
to
use
the
court's
language,
closely
fitted
to
the
circumstances.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
one
possibility
might
be
no
unattended
displays
at
any
time,
including
religious
and
nonreligious.
we
would
maintain
that
they
could
say,
no
unattended
displays
so
long
as
there
was
some
legitimate
reason
for
extracting
that
part
of
the
speech
of
the...
speech
in
that
forum
from
what
it
is
at
present.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
they
could
indeed.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
there
is
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
to
suggest
that,
justice
kennedy.
it
could
well
be.
the
state
did
initially
have
public
statements
and
discussions
regarding
that
it
did
not
wish
to
have
the
klan
display.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
no,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
we
believe
that
when
there
is
a
traditional
public
forum,
as
there
is
in
this
case,
the
state
cannot
be
in
the
position,
as
it
did
in
this
case,
of
making
ad
hoc
willy
nilly
judgments.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
it
could
pull
in
the
limits
of
the
forum.
we
believe
it
ought
not
to
be
doing
so
for
any
unholy...
any
type
of
unholy
reason.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
we
believe
not.
we
believe
that--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--no,
justice
kennedy.
we
believe
that
time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions
must
be
reasonable.
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
has
for
decades
held
that
time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions,
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions
are
appropriate,
but
should
not
be
content-based.
we
do
maintain
that
the
state
could,
indeed,
exclude
all
unattended
displays.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
and,
justice
stevens,
yes,
in
that
particular
hypothetical
example,
they
are
not
looking
to
the
content
of
individual
speakers.
they
are
withdrawing
the
whole
area
as
a
public
forum
and
just
labeling
it
as
a
state
area.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
well,
frankly--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--justice
scalia,
we
do
not
find
that
acceptable.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
public
forum
area.
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
the
entire
statehouse
grounds
could
not
be
withdrawn
from--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--justice
ginsburg,
we
believe
that
the
establishment
clause
clearly
creates
a
legitimate
interest
for
the
state
to
make
an
inquiry.
when
you
have
a
public
forum,
we
do
acknowledge
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
honoring
the
establishment
clause
and
following
its
commands.
in
this
particular
instance
and
in
general
the
state
makes
a
major
mistake.
the
establishment
clause
is
to
be
read
along
with
the
free
exercise
clause
and
the
other
expression
clauses
of
the
first
amendment.
we
believe
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause
are
co-guarantors
of
religious
liberty.
it
was
not...
the
establishment
clause
was
not
designed
to
be
hostile
to
religious
expression.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
justice
ginsburg,
we
believe
that
the
establishment
clause
serves
a
very
significant
interest
for
the
society,
and
as
applied
to
this
case,
we
think
the
district
court
and,
indeed,
the
circuit
as
well,
properly
applied
the
reasonable
observer
test.
the
state's
position
on
this
would
ban
all
religious
expression
in
this
context.
we
believe
the
reconciliation
of
potentially
conflicting
provisions
of
the
constitution
requires
a
narrowly
tailored
approach,
closely
fitted
is
i
think
the
appropriate
language,
and
in
so
doing,
the
state
has
all
of
the
time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions
that
it
customarily
can
use
within
the
forum.
it
can
use
those
here.
the
state
can
use
disclaimers
if
it
feels
it
becomes
necessary,
all
of
those.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
it
was
not
placed
in
a
particular
place.
it
was
placed
closer
to
the
street
than
to
the
building.
perhaps
to
understand,
since
mr.
renner
made
reference
to
the
exhibit
in
their
petition
for
cert,
i
would
encourage
you
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
to
look
at
supplemental
exhibit
106
at
the
very
end.
that,
i
think,
gives
you
the
kind
of
display.
the
klan
cross
was
not
up
at
that
moment.
it
had
been
vandalized.
but
you
can
see
other
crosses,
little
ones,
that
were
there,
too.
i
appreciate
the
state's
photography
from
a
low
angle,
shooting
upward.
we,
of
course,
engaged
in
distant
photography.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
no,
not
at
all.
the
state
could
have
said
where,
if
it
applied
that
to
all
symbols.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
the
state
didn't
insist
on
a
sign
of
any
particular
size.
the
state
was
given--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--it
could
have.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
it
could
have,
and
on
the
facts
in
this
case,
it
took
so
long
for
the
processes
to
go
forward
my
clients
very
speedily
put
together
their
symbol
and
the
disclaimer
after
the
district
court
ruled
a
couple
of
days
before
christmas.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
justice
ginsburg,
the
state
may
well
have
limitations
on
size
of
any
of
the
displays
within
the
forum,
and
if
it
ultimately
became
necessary,
in
order
to
serve
a
compelling
state
interest
of
establishment
clause
protection,
the
state
could
have
suggested
limitations.
as
it
was,
on
the
record
in
this
case
you
had
the
menorah,
which
was
14-feet
high
across,
10-feet
high,
a
christmas
tree
at
a
distance
which
was
20-feet
high.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
that
is
correct.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
justice
scalia,
we
believe
that
presumptively
the
speech
should
be
treated...
religious
speech
should
be
treated
the
same,
presumptively,
but--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--but
not
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
in
other
words,
there
may--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--no,
not
excluded,
justice
scalia.
the
state
could
impose
time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions
and
take
a
variety
of
measures,
not
exclusions.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
no,
it...
well--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--justice
scalia--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--exclusion,
you're
absolutely
correct,
is
not
a
case-by-case.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
that's
correct,
and
time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions
might
be
appropriate
in
terms
of,
if
there
is
that
overwhelming
appearance
of
endorsement
that
the
state
seems
so
worried--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--i
think
not.
i
think
i
was
stating,
one
hopes
sufficiently
articulated,
that
when
there
is
this
tradition,
as
in
lamb's
chapel,
when
there
is
this
understanding
of
the
access
to
the
forum,
that
reasonable
observers
would
understand
the
nature
of
the
forum.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
no.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
no,
i
believe
not,
justice--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--no.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
no,
justice
scalia.
the
reasonable
observer
approach
does
not
justify
a
ban.
the
reasonable
observer
approach,
that
approach
may
only
justify
the
use
of
appropriate
time,
place,
and
manner
devices.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
i
believe
that
the
state
rules
do
not
prohibit
that,
and
that
the
state--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--yes.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
that's
correct.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
i
do
not
know
if
that--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--i
don't
know
of
anything
specifically
on
that
in
the
record.
there
was,
after
all
of
this,
a
candidate
for
governor
who
chose
to
camp
out
for
roughly
a
month
on
the
statehouse
lawn,
but
of
course,
that
would
have
been
attended.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
no.
we
believe
that
the
state
cannot
say,
because
there
is
hostility
to
this
symbol,
we
are
closing
it
down.
that's
closing
it
down
because
of--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--no,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
the
state
cannot
terminate
the
public
forum,
which...
this
is
one
of
the
most
quintessential
ever.
this
is
the
central
square,
the
city
square.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
this
is
in
fact--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--no.
we
believe
that
state
capitol
buildings
and
county
buildings
are
traditional
locations
for
speech
and,
in
fact,
as
this
court
has
noted
in
edwards
v.
south
carolina,
this
is
one
of
those
areas
most
important
to
have
speech.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
we
could,
depending
on
events
that
occurred.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
the
state,
for
neutral
reasons,
not
content-based,
the
state
could
choose
not
to
have
unattended
displays.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
yes.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
no,
we
would--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--we
would
say
that
religious
displays
must
be
permitted,
not
banned.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
no.
we're
saying
if
there
are
other
forms
of
displays,
political,
social,
whatever
those
forms
of
displays,
then
the
religious
symbols
must
be
permitted.
we
do
maintain--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--everyone
has
to
play--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--by
the
same
rules.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
not
quite.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
no.
we
are
saying
that
in
those--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--well,
i
think
one
is
not--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--if
everything
is
the
same,
the
establishment
clause
would
not
apply,
but
these
things
happen
in
different
ways
in
different
places,
and
everything
may
not
be
the
same.
there
may
be
some
circumstance
where,
for
instance,
the
state--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--i
can't
think--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--i
cannot
think
of
an
example
where
you
could
outright
ban.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
the
establishment
clause
may
bear
where,
if
absent
certain
types
of
handling
of
displays
it
becomes
necessary
for
some
special
reason,
given
the
extraordinarily
immense
display
as
an
example,
it
may
be
appropriate
to
have
in
general
time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
that's
content
neutral,
and
it
is
permissible.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
it
could
return
to
it,
if--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--no,
i
was
speaking
of
the
general
public
forum,
slightly
distinguished
from
displays.
if
they
have
a
content-neutral
reason
for
not
having
the
displays
there--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--yes.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
if
they
do
have
a
content-neutral
rule,
then,
indeed,
they
could
exclude
unattended
displays
from
the
public
forum,
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
i
mean,
it
may
be
that
unattended
at
night
creates
problems.
people
might
walk
into
them,
lighting,
there's
all
kinds
of
reasons
one
can
come
up
with
why--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--no.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
we
would,
indeed.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
the
klan
members
hold
themselves
out
in
this
record
as
christians.
they
hold
themselves
out
as
the
symbol
being
not
just
a
symbol
of
their
faith,
but
a
symbol
of
history,
a
symbol
of
history
that
many
of
us
may
find,
at
the
very
least,
disquieting.
nonetheless,
it
reflects
a
symbol
of
the
confederate
cross,
the
scottish
clans
of
the
1300's...
it's
not
just
a
religious
symbol.
it
has
a
variety
of
meanings,
as
do
most
types
of
symbols.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
there
is
testimony
as
to
the
mixed
purpose,
and
indeed,
not
just
testimony,
but
the
disclaimer
itself
specifically
recited...
it's
at
page
12
of
our
brief
in
chief.
the
disclaimer
itself
specifically
said
it
was
to
express
respect
for
the
holiday
season
and
to
in
fact
test
the
government
of
the
state
of
ohio,
challenge
them
over
their
discriminatory
application,
granting
the
application
of
the
menorah.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
well,
we
believe
that
free
exercise
is
not
a
problem.
we
believe
that--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--in
this
case,
the
state
is
asserting
that
the
establishment
clause
bans
it,
and
we
think
they're
totally
off-base
in
doing
it.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
a
burning
cross,
i
believe,
would
symbolize
the
general
orientation
of
the
ku
klux
klan
against
racial
minorities,
not
just
you,
ethnic
minorities,
myself
and
others,
a
whole
variety
of
purposes.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
could
see
fire,
you
mean
figuratively?
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
perhaps
some
could.
the
record
here
indicates,
though,
there
were
no
security
issues.
the
judge
specifically--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--yes,
i
think
that's
true,
and
that's
a
political
message,
and
one
very
much
protected
by
the
free
speech
clause.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
we
believe
not.
the
political
message
does
not.
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
my
own
personal
views,
but
not
in
the
record,
are
that
i
would
view
it
as
mostly
a
political
statement,
but
we...
and
in
fact
we
believe
that
the
state
has
used
the
establishment
clause
as
a
make-weight
in
this
matter.
the
establishment
clause
is
not
irrelevant,
but
we
think
that
it
has
been--
mr.
benson
a.
wolman
--we
believe
the
state
has
done
just
that.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
