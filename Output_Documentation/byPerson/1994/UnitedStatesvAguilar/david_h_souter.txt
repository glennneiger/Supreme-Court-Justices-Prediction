justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
feldman,
i
suppose
if
we
went
about
statutory
interpretation
sort
of
in
the
usual
way
and
looked
at
the
series
of
related
statutes,
1503
and
1512,
and
we
looked
at
them
cold,
we'd
probably
say,
well,
1512
is
the
one
which
is
obviously
aimed
at
this
situation,
and
so
the
catch-all
in
1503
probably
shouldn't
be
construed
to
cover
it.
as
i
understand,
as
i
recall
your
brief,
an
answer
to
that
is
that
in
fact
1512(b)
in
fact
does
not
have
the
same
kind
of
coverage
that
1503
would
have
on
your
theory.
would
you
explain
to
me
what
the
distinctions
are?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
omnibus
character.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
there
was
another
distinction
that
you
were
making,
and
i
don't
remember
what
it
was.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
but
that's
always
true
of
a
catch-all,
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
i
mean,
if
that
were
the
distinction,
then
in
effect
the
catch-all
would
always
be
duplicative
of
the
more
specific
statute
on
your
theory,
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
your
earlier
case,
was
the
fbi
agent
acting
sort
of
specifically
as
the
grand
jury's
agent
at
the
time?
was
he
going
back
and
forth
and
the
grand
jury,
in
effect,
requested
the
agent
to
gather
information?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
suppose
under
the
omnibus
clause
you
could
prosecute
a
person
for
lying
before
his
own...
at
his
own
trial
on
the
witness
stand.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
answer
to
what's
bothering
people
possibly
an
historical
answer?
is
this
particular
point
of
drafting,
the
use
of
the
word
"corruptly",
something
from
the...
a
much
earlier
statute?
what
i'm
thinking
of
is,
i
can
remember
reading
old
statutes
that
speak
of
feloniously,
for
example,
committing
acts.
well,
the
fact
that
they're
made
crimes
by
the
statute
means,
in
a
sense,
they're
all
feloniously
done,
and
all
that's
trying
to
pick
up
is
the
general
notion
of
criminal
intent.
are
we
in
the
same
boat
with
"corruptly"
in
this
statute,
that
it's
sort
of
a
piece
of
antique
drafting?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
know
when
it
first
appeared
in
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
he
doesn't
really
have
to
have
knowledge
of
the
application.
he
has
to
have
knowledge
that
there
has
been
an
authorization
or
an
application.
he
doesn't
have
to
know
what's
in
it,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
the
knowledge
which
is
spoken
of
in
the
first
clause
is
a
knowledge
of
possibility,
it's
not
a
knowledge
of
specifics.
justice
david
h.
souter
specifics
will
satisfy
it,
but
possibilities
will,
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
possibility
about
its
content,
duration,
and
so
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
an
application
which
the
agent
believes
to
be
possible
is
also
a
possible
interception.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
not
modify
it,
but
it
may
refer
back
to
it
in
the
sense
of
taking
the
meaning
possibility
from
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
do
that
simply
by
referring
to
what
the
defendant
understands
or
believes
to
be
the
application,
or
the
authorization.
that
is
a
perfectly
consistent
reading,
i
would
suppose,
and
i
thought
a
moment
ago
you
conceded
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
the
answer
to
your
objection,
to
your
argument
that
he
does
not
have
to
know
the
particular
content
or
details
of
the
authorization,
he
does
have
to
know
that
there
has
been
an
application
or
an
authorization,
and
the
knowledge,
the
reference
of
possibility,
is
back
to
what
he
knows,
i.e.,
understands
to
have
been
the
application
or
the
authorization,
and
if,
in
fact,
what
he
knows
is
indeterminate,
then
the
possibility,
i
would
suppose,
is
likewise
indeterminate?
justice
david
h.
souter
not
necessarily
knowledge
of
its
content
or
specifically
the
content
of
any
order
that
may
have
been
issued?
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
you're
saying
that
the
knowledge
he
gets
would
preclude
the
intent
which
is
necessary?
