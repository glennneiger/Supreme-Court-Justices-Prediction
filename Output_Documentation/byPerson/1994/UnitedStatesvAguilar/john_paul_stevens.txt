mr.
feldman,
what
is
the
closest
case
in
the
courts
of
appeal
supporting
your
position
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
grubb
case
was
testimony
before
the
grand
jury,
wasn't
it?
justice

wasn't
the
grubb
case

justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that's
troubling
me,
mr.
feldman?
supposing
the
defendant
knows
there's
a
wiretap,
and
knows
that
it
authorizes
interception
of
x's
conversations
with
y,
thinks
it
authorizes
x's
conversations
with
z,
but
in
fact,
it
doesn't.
he
tells
z.
does
he
violate
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
knew
about
the
application.
he
knew--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
was
an
existing
application.
he
knew...
he
thought
it
was
a
little
broader
than
it
was,
and
he,
for
bad
purposes,
told
the
person
who's
not
affected
by
it
at
all,
with
the
intent
to
violate
it.
would
that
violate
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
very
similar
to
this
case,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's...
that's
sort
of
lateral
rather
than
vertical,
but
it's
the
same
sort
of
impossibility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
wrong
about
that,
just
as
in
my
hypo
he's
wrong
about
the
person
who
might
be
affected
by
it.
