mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
out
of
the
conviction
of
respondent,
a
united
states
federal
district
court
judge,
on
two
counts.
the
first
count
charged
him
with
obstruction
of
justice
in
violation
of
the
omnibus
clause
of
18
u.s.c.
section
1503,
and
it
was
based
on
his
attempt
to
obstruct
a
grand
jury
investigation
by
making
false
statements
to
fbi
agents
that
he
knew
would
be
reported
to
the
grand
jury.
the
second
count
charged
him
with
disclosing
a
wiretap
application
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
2232(c).
that...
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
first
count
on
the
ground
that
his
conduct
could
not
constitute
obstruction
of
justice
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
it
reversed
his
conviction
on
the
second
count
on
the
ground
that
the
wiretap
that
he
disclosed
had
already
expired
by
the
time
he
disclosed
it.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it
likely
would
have
been
covered.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it
likely
would
have
been
covered
under
section
1512.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think
the
main
reason
is
that
respondent's
conduct,
if
you
looked
at
what
he
did,
was
aimed...
it
was
felt
was
aimed
directly
at
the
grand
jury
investigation,
and
that
therefore
the
count
that
had
to
do
with
obstruction
of
a
grand
jury
investigation
was
the
most
appropriate
count.
about
a
month
before
he
made
the
false
statements
to
the
fbi
agents,
his
coconspirator
informed
him
there
was
a
grand
jury
investigation
going
on,
and
he
said
he
was
concerned
about
what
would
happen
if
he
was
subpoenaed
to
testify.
at
the
beginning
of
the
interview
with
the
fbi
agents,
almost
at
the
very
early
stages
he
asked,
am
i
a
target,
a
term
which
he
later
testified
was
known
to
be
used
by
fbi
agents
in
connection
with
grand
jury
investigations.
at
the
end
of
the
interview,
near
the
end
of
the
interview
when
they
asked
him,
do
you
have
any
questions
for
us,
his
response...
almost
his
first
response
was
first
whether,
again,
whether
he
was
a
target,
and
secondly,
expressing
concern
that
he
might
be
indicted,
and
finally,
when
he
testified
at
trial
in
this
case,
he
specifically
said
that
he
knew
that
his
statements
would
be
reported
to
the
grand
jury,
at
least
at
the
end
of
the
interview.
now,
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--at
least
agent
carlon
did.
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
other
one
did
or
not.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
there
was
a
feeling
that
they
were
in
charge
of
bringing
it
to
the
grand
jury,
because
i
don't
think
the
count
rested
on
any
showing
that
they
were
in
charge
of
the
investigation.
his
obstruction
of
the...
he
was
trying
to
get
false
information
to
the
grand
jury
in
the
same
way
that
somebody
who
alters
or
destroys
documents
is
trying
to
get
that
false
information
to
a
grand
jury.
the
medium
he
chose,
which
was
an
effective
one,
could
have
been
an
effective
one,
was
through
the...
making
false
statements
to
the
fbi
agents
that
he
knew
would
be
reported
to
the
grand
jury,
but
i
don't
think
their
status
as
being
in
charge
of
the
investigation
was
essential
to
the
charge,
or
even
important.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
he
wasn't
charged
under
1001.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
in
our
view
that
would
have
applied.
i
do
have
to
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
a
very
expansive
view
of
what's
been
called
the
exculpatory
no
doctrine,
and
it's
not
clear
to
me
whether
it
would
have
or
wouldn't
have
in
the
ninth
circuit.
it's
kind
of
hard
to
make
that
out.
but
in
any
event,
the
reason
he
was
charged
under
1503
as
opposed
to
that
count
was,
once
again,
that
when
the
case
was
analyzed
it
was
seen
that
his
conduct
was
aimed
directly
at
the
grand
jury
investigation,
and
that
therefore
that
was
the
most
important
and
the
most
appropriate
charge
to
bring
before
the
trial
jury.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
1512
in
some
respects
is
broader
than
1503,
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think
the
main
point
would
be
that
section
1503
is
a
catch-all
provision,
and
it
covers
a
great
deal
of
conduct
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
what
would
be
covered
by
section
1512.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
and
i
think
it's
also,
i
guess
i
would...
i'd
just--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
i
don't
think
that
that's
true
that
it
would
always...
it
has
some
overlap
both
with
the
earlier
clauses
of
section
1503,
with
section
1512,
and
with
some
of
the
other
obstruction
of
justice
statutes,
but
the
fact
that
it
has
that
overlap
is
necessarily
a
result
of
the
fact
that
it
is
an
omnibus
clause
and
a
catch-all
clause.
those
other
statutes
in
turn
cover
conduct
that's
not
covered
by
section
1503.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
do
think
he
could
have
been
charged
under
1512.
it's
not
uncommon
in
federal
criminal
prosecutions
that
there's
a
number
of
different
statutes
that
would
apply
to
a
given
defendant's
conduct,
and
it's
up
to
the
prosecutor
to
decide
which
is
most
appropriate.
i'd
also
point
out
that
under
section
1512
the
penalties
are...
i
think
the
monetary
penalty
is
five
times
as
high,
the
term
of
imprison...
the
maximum
imprisonment
is
twice
as
high,
and
there
are
differences
of
that
sort
between
the
two
statutes
that
might
make
one...
that
might
go
into
the
decision
as
to
which
one
to
charge,
but
the
main
reason
was
that
we
felt
that
his
conduct
was
aimed
directly
at
the
grand
jury,
and
that
that's
what
should
be
charged.
i'd
also
say
that
i
don't
think
that
it's
appropriate
to
construe
a
catch-all
provision
such
as
1503
by
first
looking
to
other
provisions
and
seeing
what
the
coverage
of
those
is
and
cutting
out
holes
from
1503
to
correspond
to
other
provisions.
1503
has
always
been
understood
to
cover
not
only
some
of
the
territory
that
the
other
provisions
cover,
but
some
of
the
territory
that
they
don't
cover,
and
where
the
conduct
comes
within
the
plain
meaning
of
the
omnibus
clause
of
section
1503,
there's
no
reason
to
then
look
at
some
other
statute
to
see
that
even
though
it's
within
the
plain
meaning
of
that
omnibus
provision,
we're
going
to
cut
a
hole
for
1512,
or
1513,
or
1508,
or
any
of
the
other
obstruction
of
justice
statutes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
before...
well,
i
think
the
closest
case
probably
is
the
grubb
case,
united
states
v.
grubb.
there
was
also
the
wood
case,
where,
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
reversed
the
conviction
on
grounds
that
are
not
that
clear
to
me,
so
we
wouldn't
agree
with
the
result
in
that
case.
but
in
addition
to
that,
even
before
1982,
when
congress
made
the
change
and
enacted...
when
grubb
was
enacted--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
the
grubb
case
was
testimony
to
an
fbi...
it
was
statements
that
were
made
to
fbi
agents
that
were
investigating,
just
as
the
agents
were
here,
and
would
be
reported
back
to
the
grand
jury.
in
addition
to
that,
before...
even
before
1982,
when
section
1512
was
enacted,
there
was
a
case
called
hawkins,
which
we
cite
at
page
19
of
our
petition,
that
involved
very
similar
conduct,
also
false
statements
to
fbi
agents.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
there's
no...
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
and
certainly
as
far
as
you
can
tell
from
the
reports
of
any
of
those
cases,
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
he
was
acting
any
closer,
in
any
closer
connection
to
the
grand
jury
than
the
fbi
agents
were
here.
that
is...
you
have
to
remember
that
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
there
was
a
pending
proceeding
and
respondent
knew
that
that
pending
proceeding
was
going
on.
he
also
knew
that
his
false
statements
would
be
reported
to
the
grand
jury.
that's
what
he
told
the
jury,
the
trial
jury.
i
think,
in
fact,
he
was
right,
because
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
that
carlon
did
testify
before
the
grand
jury.
i
think
that's
as
close
a
connection
as
you
need.
respondent
has
argued
that
you
need
some
kind
of
1503.
i
don't
know
what
that
term
means.
it's
not
one
that
any
court
of
appeals
has
ever
used
in
connection
with
this
statute.
insofar
as
it
means
that
there
has
to
be
some
connection,
in
that
ordinarily
people
don't...
ordinarily,
in
order
to
be
said
to
endeavor
to
obstruct
something,
you
ordinarily
would
use
some
means
that
has
some
capability
of
affecting
that
proceeding
that
you're
trying
to
obstruct,
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
it,
but
i
don't
know
how
directness
would
be
measured,
and
nor
do
i
see
anything
in
section
1503
that
distinguishes
between
direct
and
indirect,
or
allows
you
somehow
to
draw
degrees
of
directness
and
say
well,
this
is
direct
enough
to
be
prosecuted
under
1503,
and
that
is
not.
if
the
defendant's
intent
is
to
obstruct
the
grand
jury,
and
if
there's
a
pending
proceeding
and
the
defendant
knows
that
that
pending
proceeding
is
going
on,
his
conduct
is...
can
be
prosecuted
under
the
omnibus
clause
of
section--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that's
probably
right.
you
probably
could.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
"corruptly"
has,
i
think,
uniformly
been
construed
by
the
courts
of
appeals
to
mean
that
you
need
the
specific
intent
to
obstruct,
and
in
fact
it
has
a
number
of
different
meanings
depending
on
what
the
specific
offense
probably
is
that's
being
charged,
because
there's
such
a
broad
range
of
conduct
that
does
come
in
within
the
omnibus
clause.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
in
combination
with
"endeavor"
it
brings
into
intent.
i
mean,
"endeavor"...
"endeavor"
was
added...
the
history
of
the
statute
is
that
"endeavor"
was
added
in
order
to
eliminate
the
niceties
of
the
law
of
attempt
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
i
don't
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think,
first
the
jury
was
instructed
in
this
case
that
respondent
had
to
be
trying
to
obtain
some
advantage
for
himself,
and
they
found
that
he
was,
and
in
fact
he
was
trying
to
obtain
an
advantage
for
himself.
he
was
trying
to
avoid
being
called
before
the
grand
jury,
and
he
was
trying
to
avoid
being
indicted
in
improper
ways,
so
that...
as
far
as
the
definition
that
you
read,
i
think
that
this
case
satisfies
it
easily.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
in
some...
i
guess
the...
stating
the
fact
that
the
defendant
has
lied
is
not
itself
a
statutory
term.
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
why
that
would
create
a
problem.
"corruptly"
indicates
that
you
have
to
have
the
specific
intent
to
obstruct.
there's
been
numerous
cases,
not
only
about
false
statements
made
directly
to
a
grand
jury,
but
about...
i
think
a
core
application
of
section
1503
is
the
alteration
or
destruction
of
documents
for
presentation
to
a
grand
jury,
and
that
conduct
really
is
identical
to
the
conduct
that
respondent
engaged
in
here,
except
that
instead
of
by
altering
a
document
and
giving
that
to
the
grand
jury,
you're
making
a
statement
to
the
fbi
agent
that
will
bring
an
equally
false
piece
of
information
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
guess...
i
don't
know
if
i...
i
can't
think
of
an
example
offhand
for
that,
but
again,
i'm
not
sure
why
the
fact
of
whether...
why
you...
false
statement
cases
may,
just
like
alteration
or
forgery
of
document
cases,
may
always
be
corrupt,
because
whenever
they're
altering
or
forging
a
document
knowingly,
it's
going
to
be
a
corrupt
action
in
the
sense
that
the
statute
means
it.
i
suppose
if
the
defendant
was
not
trying
to
gain
any
benefit
for
himself
or
other,
someone
else,
perhaps
it
wouldn't
be
corrupt
in
that
sense,
although
it's
hard
to
envision
a
case
where
the
defendant
would
engage
in
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
so,
except
the
only
thing--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
was
in
the
statute
at
least
as
far
back
as
the
pettibone
case
100
years
ago
in
1893,
or
'92.
i'm
not
sure...
i
have
a
feeling
it
may
well
go
back
to
the
origin
of
the
statute,
which
was,
i
think,
1831.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
our
theory
that
he
actually
did
give
notice,
although
only
an
attempt
would
be
necessary
for
violation
of
this
statute.
i
think
the
dispute
about
that
provision
centers--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
and
the
question
is
whether,
when
the
statute
says,
what
he
has
to
disclose
is
the
possible
interception,
really
the
dispute
concerns
the
meaning
of
the
word
"possible"
there.
now,
what
the
statute
requires
is
that
a
defendant
have
knowledge
of
either
an
authorization
or
an
application
to
intercept
telephone
communications,
that
he
act
in
order
to
obstruct
such
interception,
and
that
he
give
notice
of
the
possible
interception.
now,
when
you
talk
about
the
interception
that
might
result
from
an
application
or
authorization
for
wiretapping,
the
interception
has
to
be
understood
to
extend
not
simply
to
the
initial
period
of
up
to
30
days
that
you
can
get
an
order
for,
but
any
additional
extensions
of
that
period
that
might
be
added,
and
respondent
plainly
thought
that
that's
what
had
occurred
in
this
case,
when
5
months
after
he
found
out
about
the
authorization
he
gave
notice...
he
gave
notice
to
the
target
of
it
in
order
to
obstruct
it.
in
our
view,
the
term,
"possible",
there,
was
used
to
tie
back
into
the
first
clause
of
the
statute.
that
is,
it
ordinarily
will
be
the
case
that
a
defendant
will
not
know
whether
interception
actually
is
going
on,
and
defendant
didn't
know
that
in
this
case.
ordinarily,
all
the
defendant
will
find
out
about
is
an
application
or
an
authorization.
he
doesn't
know
what's
happened
to
it
after
that.
and
so
when
congress
referred
in
the
final...
in
the
last
part
of
the
statute
to
the
possible
interception,
what
they...
what
congress
was
referring
to
is,
what
he
has
to
disclose
is
that
of
which
he
has
knowledge,
that
there
is
a
possible
interception,
and
that's
the
act
of
disclosure
that's
prohibited.
in
other
words,
if
the
defendant
goes
to
someone
and
says,
"there's
a
possible
interception,
or
there
might
be
an
interception
on
your
phone.
"
"i
heard
about
it.
"
"you
better
not
talk
on
the
phone.
"
then
i
think
he's
guilty
of
violating
the
statute.
that,
i
think,
is
clearly
the
meaning
of
the
term
"possible"
in
the
statute,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
defendant
violated...
that
respondent
violated
it.
now,
respondent
says,
and
the
court
of
appeals
believed,
that
the
term
"possible"
was
a
term
of
limitation
on
the
statute,
and
that
congress
wanted
to
let
the
people
who
disclose
a
statute
with...
a
wiretap
with
intent
to
disrupt
it
should
be...
should
not
be
able
to
be
prosecuted
if
for
some
reason
entirely
unbeknownst
to
them
the
interception
is
not
going
on,
or
can't
go
on.
if,
for
instance,
the
target
is
deceased,
if
the
target's
moved
to
a
new
house
and
isn't
at
the
same
telephone
number
anymore,
if
the
target's
already
been
informed
of
the
wiretap,
and
therefore
wasn't
going
to
be
talking
on
the
phone
under
any
circumstances,
or
if
the
wiretap
has
expired,
as
happened
in
this
case.
but
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
reason
why
congress
would
have
created
a...
would
have
written
a
statute,
and
i
really
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
create
those
kinds
of
windfall
defenses
that
are
based
on
the
fact
that
the
defendant
didn't
know
about
the...
didn't
know
about
the
fact
that
he's
now
saying
precludes
his
prosecution.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
there
is
any
disagreement.
i
mean,
to
be
frank,
the
statute...
there's
only
been
a
few
prosecutions
under
the
statute.
i
think
there's
only
one
or
two
other
reported
decisions.
i
don't
think
that
there's...
i
don't
think
anyone...
any
other
court
has
directly
addressed
it
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
did
in
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
would
have
been...
i...
you
know,
i...
it
would
have
been...
you
would
have
had
to
show
under
1512
was
that
there
was
an
official
proceeding,
and
in
this
case
you
had
to
show
there
was
a
pending
proceeding.
i
think
it
really,
as
a
matter
of
law,
works
out
to
the
same
thing.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
possible
that
he
would
be
able
to.
i
can't
definitively
say
whether
he
would
or
not,
but
i
do
think
that...
i
do
think
it's
important
in
this
case
that...
to
realize
that
the
omnibus
clause
of
1503
being
a
broad
clause
that's
intended
to
extend
or
to
cover
lots
of
territory,
not
only
territory
that's
also
covered
by
the
earlier
provisions
of
section
1503
and
by
other
statutes
but
also
far
beyond
that,
that
when
congress
enacted
1512,
they
would
have
had
no
way
to
know
the
courts
would
later...
and
at
that
point
they
didn't
change
the
omnibus
clause
at
all.
they
would
have
had...
congress
would
have
had
no
way
to
know
that
courts
later
would
come
along
and
construe
the
statute
as
if
they
had
narrowed
the
scope
of
the
omnibus
clause.
in
fact,
what
congress
knew
at
that
time
was
that,
as
in
the
hawkins
and
haldeman
cases
that
i
was
talking
about
before,
was
that
people
had
been
prosecuted
for
conduct
that
was
very
similar
to
the
conduct
that
respondent
engaged
in
here,
and
they
also
knew
that
the
omnibus
clause
of
1503
was
not
limited
to
simply
covering
gaps
that
weren't
covered
by
other
statutes,
that
it
was
instead
intended
to
cover
a
broad
range,
including
many
things
that
were
covered
by
other
statutes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
there
were.
there
were
references
to
witnesses
in
the
two
earlier,
very
specific
clauses
of
1503,
and
what
congress
did
is
took
each
of
those
references
and
made
them
into
a
whole
separate
statute.
but
the
omnibus
clause,
which
stands
on
its
own
and
as
a
matter
of
grammar
and
as
a
matter
of
logic,
and
it's
far
broader
and
has
never
been
limited
just
to
the
scope
of
the
earlier
clauses
of
1503,
the
omnibus
clause
was
not
changed
at
all.
in
our
view,
that's
the
central
fact
about
interpreting
what
congress
did
when
it
made
that
change.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
essentially
that's
right.
i
think
what
he
has
to
be
shown
to
do
is
intend
to
obstruct
or
interfere
with
the
wiretap
of
which
the...
of
which...
that
could
have
resulted
from
the
facts
of
which
he
has
knowledge,
what
his
knowledge
is.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
don't
think
he
does
get
off
under
the
circumstances.
i
think
if
he
has
such...
i
think
ordinarily
in
the
criminal
law
if
you
have
that
kind
of
total
disregard
for
whether
you're
violating
the
law
or
not,
i
think
ordinarily
that
would
be
shown
to
have
the
necessary
intent,
just
as
if
you
shoot
a
gun
at
someone
and
you
don't
really
care
if
you
kill
them
or
something,
i
think
ordinarily
you
would
be
charged
with
murder.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
but
i
think
the
"in
order
to"
clause
is
meant
to
apply
for
the
purpose
of
interfering
with
the
wiretap.
i
think
respondent
in
this
case,
he
told...
he
said
on
several
occasions
that
he
had
heard
about
the
wiretap
at
work
2
months
after
he
made
his
disclosure.
he
said--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
don't
think
he
could
be,
but
the
reason
he
couldn't
be
is,
if
you
know
that
the
wiretap
has
expired,
then
you
can't
be
found
to
have
intended
to
obstruct
it,
or
at
least
it
would
be
a
very
odd
situation,
which--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right,
and
i
think
that
would
obviously
be
an
entirely
inappropriate--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
think
so,
and
i
don't
think
that
that
kind
of
guesswork
is
what
i'm
talking
about
when
i
say
that
he
knows
that
it's
expired.
i
don't
think
it's
whether
he's
guessing
that
it
might
be
expired,
and
indeed,
in
criminal
investigations
and
in
complex
criminal
investigations,
it's
very
common
for
wiretaps
to
be
extended
for
successive
30-day
periods
with
or
without
short
breaks
for
a
very,
very
long
period
of
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
he
testified?
you
know,
if
the...
i
think
even
more
probable
than
not
i
don't
think
would
be
sufficient.
if
he
testified
that
he
believed
that
it
had
not
expired
and
didn't
intend
to
obstruct
it,
and
if
the
jury
believed
that,
then
i
suppose
the
jury
could
have
acquitted
him,
but
i
do
think
at
least
the
jury
certainly
isn't
required
to
listen
to
what
his
testimony
would
be
on
that
point,
nor
i
think
did
he...
i
don't
think
he
did
testify
in
this
case
to
anything
like
that
fact.
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
protect
not
just
the
existing
wiretaps,
but
the
possibility
that
wiretaps
would
be
continued
and
would
be
extended
at
a
later
date,
and
would
be
extended
perhaps
with
a
short
gap
or
perhaps
not,
and
it's
precisely
because
congress
knew
that
these
things
only
go
for
a
maximum
of
30
days
at
a
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
i
think
as
long
as
there's
a
possibility
that
the
wiretap
could
be
extended,
i
think
the
statute
could
be
read
to
read...
to
apply
to
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
might
well
be
the
case.
the
fact
is
that
in
this
case
the
inventories
weren't
given
until
a
year
after
he
made
his
disclosure,
or
more
than
a
year
afterwards,
and
indeed,
the
provision
that
congress
put
in
the
statute
for
extending
the
period
of
giving
the
inventory
and
therefore
disclosing
to
the
target
that
there's
been
a
wiretap,
the
fact
that
congress
allowed
for
those
periods
to
be
extended
specifically
to
protect
the
ongoing
wiretap
and
the
ongoing
investigation,
i
think
supports
our
construction
of
the
statute,
that
it,
too,
was
intended
to
protect
against
the
possibility
of
the
extensions.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
just
had
two
brief
points
i
wanted
to
make.
first,
with
respect
to
section
1503
and
the
questions
that
arose
concerning
agent
carlon's
testimony,
section
1503
is
a
statute
that
prohibits
endeavors,
and
the
one
principle
that's
been
quite
clear
from
this
court's
decisions
about
the
statute
is
it
prohibits
endeavors
to
obstruct
justice.
therefore,
although
it's
not
important
whether
agent
carlon
actually
testified,
what
is
crucial,
especially
in
light
of
counsel's
argument,
i
think,
is
that
respondent
himself
testified
at
trial
that
he
knew
that
the
false
statements
that
he
made
to
agent
carlon
would
be
reported
to
the
grand
jury,
and
i
think
that's
what
makes
it
sufficient
to
violate
the
statute.
with
respect
to
section
2232(c),
i
think
that
i'd
just
like
to
make
two
other
brief
points.
one
is
that
the
statute
was
clearly
designed
not
just
to
address,
to
be
retributive
of
an
actual
evil
that
occurred,
an
obstruction
of
an
interception,
but
to
have
a
broader
deterrent
effect.
that's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
the...
aside
from
the
language
of
the
statute.
i
think
it's
clear
from
that,
but
also
the
legislative
history,
which
where
the...
both
the
senate
and
house
committee
reports
on
the
statute
describe
in
identical
terms
the
coverage.
that
is,
it
is
intended
to
deter.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
guess
that
would...
i
think
that
would
depend
on
whether
in
the
first
clause
of
the
statute
it...
what
it
is
that
he
has
to
have
knowledge
of,
when
it
says
he
has
to
know
of
an
application
or
authorization.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think...
it's
hard...
i
tell
you,
frankly,
it's
hard
for
me
to
tell--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
really
don't
think
it
is.
well,
at
least
in
this
case
it's
clear
that
what
he
knew
and
what
he
repeatedly
said
he
knew
was
that
there
was
an
interception
going
on.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
well,
i
mean,
i
suppose
in
that...
in
the
case
that
you
posit,
i
think
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
that,
too,
if
he
acted
in
order
to
obstruct
the
interception
that
he
knew
about...
so
long
as
he
knew
about
it,
and
as
long
as
what
he
acted
was
in
order
to
obstruct
it,
and
what
he
said
was,
there's
a
possible
interception,
again
referring
back
to
what
his
actual
knowledge
was.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't...
i
do
a
couple
of
things.
one
is,
i
don't
think
that...
the
statute
talks
about
having
knowledge
of
an
application
or
an
authorization,
and
what
you
get
at
the
end
of
the
process
is
knowledge
of
a
completed
wiretap,
not
necessarily
an
application
or
an
authorization.
in
some
sense--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
it
would
be
likely
to
be.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think
also
because
there
would
be
the
question
of
whether
you
would
construe
that
to
be
knowledge
of
an
application
or
an
authorization,
not
just
merely
because
of
the
fact
that
it's
completed,
but
it's
not...
what
he's
finding
out
there
is
the
inventory
of
the
actual
conversations,
not
the
application
or
authorization.
