mr.
feldman,
though,
did
i
understand
you
correctly
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
that
you
didn't
have
doubts
about
the
fit
of
1512,
that
you
would
think
that
1512
did
fit,
but
for
whatever
reason
you
chose
1503
instead.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
word
"corruptly"?
does
that
add
anything
to...
is
a
plain
lie
enough?
if
so,
then
"corruptly"
doesn't
seem
to
add
anything
on
your
view
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
a
lie
would
be
a
deliberate
falsehood,
would
be
for
some
purpose,
and
my
concern
is,
you
seem
to
be
reading
this
as
though
"corruptly"
just
wasn't
there,
to
add
nothing
more
than
a
deliberate
or
conscious
factor
to
it,
but
that's
what
a
lie
is.
you
consciously
tell
an
untruth.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
we
can
get
at
my
problem
this
way.
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
something
that
would
not
fit
because
it
isn't
corrupt,
that
is
a
false
statement,
but
would
not
fit
within
the
catch-all
but
is
not
corrupt?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
he
knew...
if
he
knew
that
the
wiretap
had
expired,
would
he
be
guilty
of
violating
this
statute?
it
wasn't
clear
to
me
what
your
position
is
on
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
could
just
be
intending
to
tip
your
relative
off
that
he's
under
suspicion
for
something.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
he
wouldn't
be
violating
this
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
isn't
it
logical
that
a
federal
judge
would
understand
that
the
chances
were
better
than
not
that
the
tap
would
not
have
been
continually
renewed,
so
that
at
the
time
he's
tipping
off
his
relative
it's
still
alive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
he
testified
he
thought
it
was
more
probable
than
not
that
this
tap
had
expired.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
tie
anything
to
the
time
when
the
inventory
is
given
as
any
kind
of,
at
least
at
that...
that
is
the
point
when
the
statute
no
longer
applies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
luskin,
what
about
judge
hall's
view
that
interception
is
still
possible
until
the
district
court...
as
long
as
the
district
court
orders
the
secrecy
of
the
tap
maintained?
that
seemed
to
be
what
her
position
was
on
the
three-judge
panel.
the
interception,
even
if
expired
for
the
moment,
remains
possible
until
the
time
that
the
district
judge
says,
i'm
taking
this
out
from
under
the
secrecy
cloak.
