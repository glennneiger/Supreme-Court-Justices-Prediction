justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
also
wondering
about
the
words
"in
order
to"
in
the
second
statute.
what
do
you
have
to
show
"in
order
to"?
what's
puzzling
me,
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
this,
is
imagine,
say,
that
the
defendant
says
something
about
the
tap,
but
his
motive
is
simply
to
tell
his
relative
why
he
shouldn't
come
to
the
house,
or
suppose
that
he
isn't
really
interested
in
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
new
application
and
a
new
tap.
he
doesn't
specifically
intend
to
stop,
interfere
with
the
old
expired
tap.
he
knows
sometimes
these
things
expire,
sometimes
they
don't,
sometimes
they're
renewed,
sometimes
there's
a
new
one.
what
kind
of
specific
intent
do
you
have
to
show
in
those
words
"in
order
to"?
why
wouldn't,
for
example,
you
have
to
show
that
he
specifically
intended
his
main
motive
was
to
interfere
with
this
old,
now
expired
tap,
as
compared
with
some
new
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that's
puzzling
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
he's
thinking
in
his
own
mind,
sometimes
these
things
expire...
most
judges
know
that
they
expire.
sometimes
they
get
new
ones.
i
really
don't
care
whether
i'm
giving
away
something
for
an
old
expired
tap.
that's
of
no
interest
to
me.
maybe
they
have
a
new
one.
i
don't
know.
then
he
gets
off.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.
feldman--
--but
if
you
shot
a
gun
up
in
the
air
and
it
happened
to
kill
somebody,
you
didn't
do
that
"in
order
to"
kill
somebody.
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what,
in
your
opinion,
is
the
proper
method
of
limiting
both
these
statutes,
i.e.,
1503
and
1512?
i
mean,
1512
is
enormously
broad
as
well.
it
talks
about
using
misleading
conduct
possibly
to
influence
the
testimony
of
a
witness.
well,
literally,
i
guess,
somebody
goes
and
smiles
in
a
certain
way,
thinking,
aha,
wears
a
certain
kind
of
tie,
or
goes
out
and
gives
some
kind
of
statement
to
a
fourth
cousin,
or
says
something
publicly
that
they
know
will
be
reported
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
influence
a
witness,
or...
i
mean,
you
can
spin
it
out
endlessly,
and
is
all
that
caught
by
this
statute?
is
it
totally
up
to
the
attorney
general,
or
is
there
some
kind
of
limiting
principle
that
will
separate
conduct
which
might
have
a
bad
motive,
but
be
very
common,
from
conduct
that's
very
specific,
like
yourself
testifying
falsely,
or
knowing
a
person
is
going
to
submit
tampered
documents?
i
mean,
what's
the
limiting
principle
so
that
this
statute,
or
both
of
them,
don't
encompass
the
earth?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
amorphousness
is
over
in
1512
as
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
therefore,
really
my
question
goes
to
both,
and
it's
a
general
question,
but
you've
thought
about
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
it's
relevant,
and
the
question
really
is,
how
do
you
separate
out
what
is
perhaps
quite
normal
but
very
indirect
conduct,
but
badly
intended?
i
wear
a
certain
tie,
i
talk
to
the
fourth
cousin,
i
talk
about...
i
say
something
to
the
press,
i
say
something
very
general
to
fourteen
other
people
whom
i
hope
will
be
repeated
back,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
how
do
you
distinguish
that
in
the
law,
which
would
fall
within
the
words,
from
yourself
testifying
falsely,
sending
false
documents
which
are
very
specific?
how
do
we
draw
that
line?
one
possibility
is,
there's
no
way
to
do
it.
just
leave
it
up
to
the
good
sense
of
the
attorney
general.
the
other
possibility
is,
there
is
a
way
to
do
it,
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
explore.
