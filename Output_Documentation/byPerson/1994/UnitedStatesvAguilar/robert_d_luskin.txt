mr.
robert
d.
luskin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
this
prosecution,
the
government
seeks
to
use
two
statutes,
section
1503
and
section
2232(c)
of
title
xviii,
in
ways
in
which
they
have
never
been
employed
before.
their
construction
would
dramatically
and
capriciously
extend
the
scope
of
those
statutes
without
safeguarding
a
single
interest
that
those
statutes
are
designed
to
protect.
with
respect
to
section
1503,
it's
the
government's
position
that
the
words
of
the
statute,
in
particular
the
words
of
the
omnibus
clause,
speak
for
themselves.
if
they
do,
they
do
not
speak
loudly
or
very
clearly.
the
omnibus
clause
in
essentially
its
present
form
has
been
on
the
books
for
more
than
150
years,
and
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
grubb
case,
this
is
the
first
prosecution
in
which
the
government
has
attempted
to
use
the
omnibus
clause
to
reach
simple
false
statements
to
undisclosed
potential
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury.
the
government's
construction
of
section
1503
is
flawed
in
at
least
two
distinct
respects.
in
the
first
place,
simply
on
the
basis
of
its
terms,
the
government
through
this
prosecution
ignores
the
significant
qualitative
distinction
between
the
types
of
conduct
that
have
been
traditionally
punished
under
the
omnibus
clause
and
the
type
of
conduct
it
seeks
to
punish
here,
and
in
the
second
place,
the
government's
construction
of
the
omnibus
clause
ignores
its
place
in
the
statutory
scheme
of
which
it
plays
but
a
small
part.
since
1982,
congress
has
made
as
clear
as
it
could
possibly
make
it
that
misconduct
in
relation
to
witnesses,
and
specifically
misconduct
in
relation
to
witnesses
that
is
expressly
covered
under
the
terms
of
section
1512,
should
be
prosecuted
there
and
nowhere
else.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
congress
narrowed
the
scope
of
1503
and
by
doing
that,
yes,
impliedly
narrowed
the
scope
of
section
1503.
there
was
nothing
implied
about
what
it
did
to
section
1503,
which
was
to
eliminate--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--it
took
everything
in
relation
to
witnesses
out,
and
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
the
government's
theory
of
this
prosecution,
which
is
that
judge
aguilar,
by
his
false
exculpatory
statements
to
the
fbi,
influenced
the
fbi
agents
as
potential
witnesses
so
that
they
would
convey
false
information
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
no,
sir.
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
paradigm
example
of
what
this
court
recognized
in
fausto,
which
is
that
when
congress
reorganizes
a
coherent
legislative
scheme,
that
it's
important
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
prior
text
with
a
view
towards
what
congress
attempted
to
accomplish
in
the
future.
section...
the
omnibus
clause
of
section
1503
had
never,
ever
been
used
before
1982
in
the
way
in
which
the
government
suggest
it
be
used
here.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
what
i
think
it
is,
it's
an
argument
to
say
that
in
looking
at
what
congress
accomplished
in
section
1512,
it's
important
to
look
at
the
prior
statutes,
as
this
court
did
in
fausto,
with
a
view
to
what
the
court
was
trying
to
accomplish.
what
fausto--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--i'm
sorry.
that's
correct.
in
fausto,
your
honor,
the
court
went
back
and
said
that
by
enacting
the
civil
service
reform
act
this
court
impliedly
intend...
that
congress
impliedly
intended
to
repeal
a
prior
construction
of
the
back
pay
act,
which,
by
negative
influence
from
the
new
statutory
scheme,
should
no
longer
be
maintained.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
no,
sir.
i
think
as
in
fausto
what
we're
saying
is
that
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
doctrine
of
implied
repeal
is
inapplicable,
that
this
is
a
common
sense
rule
of
where
the
congress
enacts
a
coherent,
legislative
scheme
addressed
to
a
specific
area,
which
is
in
this
case
wrongful
conduct
in
relation
to
witnesses
or
potential
witnesses,
it's
important
to
go
back
and
look
at
other
historical
provisions
with
a
view
towards
what
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
well,
if
we
were
solely
to
look
at
section
1503,
your
honor,
i
think
what
we
place
reliance
on
is
corruptly
endeavoring
to
disrupt
the
due
administration
of
justice.
from
the
beginning,
this
provision,
which
arose
out
of
the
court's...
the
congress'
effort
to
codify
the
contempt
provision,
required
a
nexus
between
the
wrongful
conduct
and
something
that's
going
on
in
court.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
i'm
saying
that.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
are
really
two
components
to
the
obstruction
of
a
due
administration
of
justice.
the
first
is
whether
as
a
matter
of
almost
but-for
causation
there's
a
possibility
that
something
that
one
does
outside
the
court
could
eventually
have
some
impact
on
something
that
happens
in
the
court,
but
the
other
thing
that
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it
has
a
qualitative
component
as
well.
and
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
in
re
michael,
which
was
a
contempt
case
but
was
also
considering
the
question
of
the
due
administration
of
justice
in
which
the
court
said
that
even
perjury
in
court
was
not
necessarily
obstructive
of
the
due
administration
of
justice
unless
it
could
be
demonstrated
qualitatively
that
there
was
a
risk
of
harm,
and
all
of
the
cases
relied
upon
by
the
government,
have
one
of
two
defining
characteristics
that's
just
not
present
here.
in
the
first
place,
where
the
grand
jury
affirmatively
exercises
its
authority
to
secure
particular
testimony,
for
example
by
a
subpoena
or
by
compelling
the
attendance
of
a
witness
before
the
grand
jury,
it's
perfectly
clear
in
those
circumstances
that
wrongful
conduct
at
that
point
has
a
substantial
risk
of
interfering
with
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
no,
ma'am.
i
think,
for
example...
and
i
think
the
destruction
of
evidence
cases
are
perfectly
good
examples
of
that.
where
the
grand
jury
has
expressed
its
interest
in
a
particular
subject
matter,
or
seeing
a
particular
document,
then
the
destruction,
concealment
or
forgery
of
that
document
would
have
the
potential
for
interfering
with
the
due
administration
of
justice.
that,
of
course,
is
not
what
was
going
on
here.
the
government
eschews
reliance
on
any
suggestion
that
the
fbi
agents
were
the
grand
jury's
agents,
or
that
they
were
acting
on
behalf
of
the
grand
jury,
that
they
had
directed
their
inquiry
or
in
any
way
expressed
an
independent
interest
in
that
subject
matter.
the
second
defining
characteristic,
your
honor,
is
affirmative
conduct
by
the
defendant
that
substantially
raises
the
risk
that
wrongful
information
is
going
to
reach
the
grand
jury,
and
i
would
give
as
a
paradigm
example
of
that
the
bribery
of
a
witness,
or
the
situation
in
hawkins,
where
the
witnesses
went
out
and
caused
a
third
party
to
pretend
to
be
a
fictitious
witness
to
give
false
testimony,
and
there,
by
the
defendant's
affirmative
endeavor,
there
is
a
likelihood
that
the
false
information
that
that
defendant
is
relating
will
reach
the
grand
jury
and
interfere
with
its
process
and,
of
course,
that's
not
present
here
either.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
i
get
it--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--i--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--i
get
it,
your
honor,
from
the
concept
of
obstruction
of
the
due
administration
of
justice,
and
the
gloss
that's
been
placed
on
that
concept
by
cases
such
as
in
re
michael
in
this
court,
and
by
other
cases
which
require--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--no,
sir.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
we
don't.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
in--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--it
makes
a
difference
only
insofar
as
it
helps
to
characterize
the
caliber,
or
quantity,
or
significance
of
the
conduct
that
has
to
take
place,
and
the
reason
that
that's
important
is
because
of
the
risk
it
carries
with
it
of
an
undue
influence
on
the
grand
jury.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
it
becomes
more
corrupt
because
it
raises
the
risk
that
the
lawful
functions
of
the
grand
jury
will
be
impeded
or
obstructive.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
we
did.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
issue
has
been
framed
by
the
government's
reply
brief,
in
which
they
suggested
essentially
that
any
kind
of
misconduct
in
any
fashion
that
might
sort
of
float
downstream
on
a
current
of
causation
might
affect
the
grand
jury.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
yes,
sir.
michael
is
found
at
66
supreme
court
reporter,
at
page
78,
and
it
is
cited
in
the
grubb
case,
on
which
the
government
relies.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
and
michael,
your
honor,
was
a
contempt
case.
it
was
not
under
1503,
but
the
issue
was
what
constitutes
interference
with
the
due
administration
of
justice,
and
section
1503
is,
if
you
will,
a
cousin
of
the
contempt
statute,
and
both
of
them
arose
together
out
of
an
effort
to
codify
the
same
concept.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
well,
two
things,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
what
congress
expressly
sought
to
do
by
enacting
section
1512,
and
it's
reflected
in
the
legislative
history,
is
two
things.
one
is
to
broaden
the
expansion
for
witnesses,
but
the
second
was
to
dispense
with
this
very
amorphous
concept
of
"corruptly"--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--it
is,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--that's
right.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
and
i
think
where
that
is
captured,
your
honor,
and
it's
been
captured
by
the
decisions
of
the
tenth
and
eleventh
circuits
in
the
wood
and
thomas
cases,
is
to
impose
a
requirement
that
in
addition
to
this
wrongful
intent,
the
conduct
itself,
qualitatively,
viewed
qualitatively
in
isolation,
has
to
have
a
natural
and
probable
consequence
of
influencing
the
due
administration
of
justice.
that's
the
standard
which
is
imposed
in
those
circuits
on
prosecutions
under
1503.
the
second
circuit
has
adopted
a
foreseeability
concept.
i
think
what's
called
out
for
here
is
some
notion
in
addition
to
the
but-for
causation
which
the
government
relies
on,
is
some
notion
that's
analogous
to
approximate
causation,
which
actually
establishes
a
nexus
between
the
character
of
the
conduct
itself
and
the
risk
of
harm
to
an
official
proceeding.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
we
do
assert
it
doesn't
exist
here.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
i
think
it
could
be
charged
under
1512.
i
think--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--i
think
that
we--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--anything
could
be
charged.
i
think
that
this
conduct
could
be
charged,
if
at
all,
under
1512.
i
think
that
there
is
a
significant
issue
on
the
facts
of
whether
or
not
judge
aguilar
had
any
idea
that
there
was
an
official
proceeding
going
on,
or
whether
he
had
any
desire
to
influence
anybody
who
might
be
a
witness
in
that
official
proceeding.
i
think
the
closest
charging
analogy
here
would
be,
of
course,
1001,
which
is
the
provision
under
which
these
charges
are
traditionally
brought
and,
of
course,
it's
our
speculation
here
that
the
reason
that
it
wasn't
done
so
was
that
judge
aguilar
was
initially
charged
also
with
a
substantive
rico
offense
under
section
1962(c),
of
which
this
act
was
charged
as
a
predicate
offense
of
racketeering.
section
1001
is
not
a
rico
predicate.
section
1503
is.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
on
section
1503,
your
honor,
and
the
instruction
is
found
at
page
127
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
they
must
find
that
the
conduct
of
judge
aguilar
was
designed
"in
some
way"
to
impede
the
functions
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
the
ninth
circuit
ultimately
affirmed,
and
we
objected
to
the
instruction
insofar
as
it
implied
that
there
was
some
natural
relationship
between
the
role
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
function...
the
fbi
agents
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
grand
jury
on
the
other.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor,
the
grand
jury
doesn't
hear
exculpatory
evidence,
and
had
the
fbi
agents
actually
believed
the
exculpatory
false
statements
that
judge
aguilar
had
made,
as
a
practical
matter
in
99
out
of
100
cases
those
exculpatory
statements
would
not
have
been
reported
to
the
grand
jury,
and
there's
no
evidence
that
the
fbi
agents
were
or
did,
in
fact,
testify
to
the
grand
jury
on
this
matter.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
but
that,
your
honor,
is
the
distinction
between
the
grand
jury
on
the
one
hand
and
the
fbi
on
the
other.
those
statements
might
well
be
viewed
to
be
material
under
1001
insofar
as
they
affect
the
functions
of
the
fbi
and
the
fbi's
investigation,
but
the
fbi's
investigation
is
not
the
grand
jury's
investigation.
the
grand
jury's
investigation
is
something
which
is
distinct,
and
which
it
controls.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
but
they're
not
linked,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
government's
theory
is
that
they
were
linked
by
the
fact
that
the
fbi
agents
as
potential,
undisclosed
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury,
might
have
carried
judge
aguilar's
false
statements
in
to
the
grand
jury
and
thereby
confused
them.
what
we're
saying
is
that
that
link
is
so
attenuated
that
it
does
not
fall
within
the
scope
of
an
obstruction
of
the
due
administration
of
justice.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
the
testimony
is
only,
your
honor,
that
one
agent
did
testify.
there's
nothing
in
the
transcript
which
would
indicate
whether
he
testified
before
he
interviewed
judge
aguilar,
or
after
he
interviewed
judge
aguilar,
or
whether
he
testified
concerning
the
subject
matter.
there
were
three
other
individuals
who
were
indicted,
and
for
all
we
can
tell
from
the
transcript
of
the
grand
jury
foreman's
testimony,
agent
carlon
might
well
have
testified
long
before
this
interview
took
place.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
yes,
sir,
you
do,
but
in
this
case
there's
really
no
evidence
at
all
from
which
one
could
infer
that
agent
carlon
testified
after
this
interview,
or
about
this
interview,
or
in
relation
to
this
interview.
let
me
turn,
if
i
may,
to
section
2232(c).
the
difference
between
our
position
and
that
of
the
government
is
that
first
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
accurately
and
fairly
accounts
for
all
the
terms
of
the
statute.
the
second
difference
is
that
the
government
wishes
to
extend
section
2232(c)
to
cover
those
situations
in
which
someone
who
is
under
the
mistaken
impression
that
a
wiretap
or
an
authorization
may
be
in
effect
discloses
that.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
government
seeks
to
prevent
windfall
defenses.
it's
a
case
in
which
it
seeks
to
preserve
windfall
prosecutions.
section
2232(c),
by
its
terms,
is
a
temporally
limited
statute.
it
is
designed
in
all
of
its
aspects
to
protect
the
integrity
of
wiretap
applications
and
authorizations
during
the
period
of
time
in
which
they
are
operating,
and
not
before,
and
not
after.
when
an
application
has
been
filed,
or
an
authorization
is
in
effect,
an
interception
is
possible,
and
a
defendant,
by
specifically
intending
to
interfere
with
such
interception,
can
impede
that
interest
which
congress
wishes
to
protect.
after
the
expiration
of
an
interception,
no
harm
is
possible,
no
interest
protected
by
the
statute
can
be
jeopardized,
and
that
conclusion
emerges
from
two
aspects
of
the
statute.
the
first
is
the
specific
intent
provision,
which
requires
that
the
defendant,
having
knowledge
of
an
application
or
an
authorization
to
intercept
electronic
communications,
discloses
that
with
the
specific
intent
to
impede
such
interception.
the
term
refers
back
to
the
initial
clause
in
which
the
knowledge
takes
place.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
well,
it's--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--not
a
possibility
about
the
existence
of
an
application
or
an
authorization.
there
my
be
some
speculation--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--yes,
sir--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--that's
correct.
but
when
he
acts
with
specific
intent,
it's
got
to
be
an
intent
to
interfere
with
such
interception
of
which
he
has
knowledge.
if
a
defendant,
for
example,
were
to
disclose
the
existence
of
a
wiretap
for
some
other
purpose...
for
example,
if
a
defendant
were
to
infer
from
the
existence
of
an
authorization
or
a
wiretap
that
a
particular
individual
must
be
a
government
witness,
and
were
to
disclose
the
existence
of
the
wiretap
to
someone
else
for
the
purpose
of
killing
that
witness,
it
would
be
a
horribly
wrongful
act.
it
would
not
be
an
act
comprehended
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
it
would
not
violate
section
2232(c).
the
statute
is
designed
by
congress
to
protect
one,
and
one
thing
only,
and
that
is
the
integrity
of
an
authorization
or
an
application
while
it's
in
place,
and
the
second
place
from
the
statute
from
which
that
conclusion
emerges
is
the
fact
that
congress
defines
the
class
of
disclosures
which
would
be
wrongful
to
be
disclosed,
and
it
defines
that
through
the
use
of
the
term
"possible
interception".
now,
an
application
which
has
been
made
but
not
yet
approved
is
possible,
an
authorization
which
is
in
place
but
has
not
yet
expired
is
a
possible
interception,
but
an
application
which
has
been
denied--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--but
the
problem
with
that,
your
honor,
is
that
the
term
"possible
interception"
defines
what
may
or
may
not
be
disclosed.
it
doesn't
modify
the
defendant's
state
of
mind,
or
his
intent.
the
difficulty
with
what
the
government
wants
to
do
here--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--it
could
indeed,
your
honor,
but
where
it
sits
in
the
statute,
the
possible
interception
refers
back
to
the
initial
clause,
which
is,
an
application
has
been
made,
or
an
authorization
is
in
place,
and
in
our
view
it
defines
the
class
of
disclosure
which
are
prohibited.
in
that
sense,
it's
really
no
different
than--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--no.
no,
i
don't,
because
what
that
would
do
is
put
the
possible
interception
back
in
the
knowledge
component,
that
the
defendant
has
to
have
actual
knowledge
of
an
application
or
an
authorization,
and
in
this
respect,
really
it's
no
different
than
the
requirement
which
has
been
imposed
judicially
in
section
1503
that
there
be
a
pending
grand
jury--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--i
understand
what
your
honor
is
saying,
but
what
the
statute
says
is,
you
have
to
have
knowledge
of
an
application
or
authorization.
you
have
to
have
specific--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--that's
correct,
but
in
the
final
clause,
which
defines
the
class
of
disclosures
which
may
not
be
made,
the
way
in
which
congress
has
defined
that
is
to
say
he
may
not
disclose
a
possible
interception,
and
that
doesn't
modify
the
defendant's
state
of
mind,
it
defines
the
class
of
things
which
may
not
be
disclosed,
and
i
think
the
government
moves
"possible"
back
into
the
state
of
mind.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
so,
and
the
reason
that
it
doesn't
is
that
the
statute
covers
not
only
the
wrongful
disclosures
of
authorizations,
but
applications,
and--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--no,
sir.
i
think
that
allows
congress
to
punish
the
disclosure
of
an
application.
if
you
were
to
find
out
from
me,
and
i
were
an
fbi
agent,
that
i'd
applied
for
a
wiretap
but
the
court
had
not
yet
ruled
on
it,
and
you
were
to
disclose
that
fact,
you
would
be
disclosing
the
existence
of
a
possible
interception,
and
the
interception
is
possible
because
i
have
applied
for
it
but
it
hasn't
been
received.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
that's
right,
and
that--
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
--you're
giving
notice
of
a
possible
interception.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
you're
giving
notice
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
an
interception
is
possible,
because
it's
been
applied
for.
if
you
said
only
interception,
it
would
not
comprehend
the
wrongful
disclosure
of
an
application,
which
is
what
the
statute
specifically
seeks
to
do.
mr.
robert
d.
luskin
and
i
think
that
that
confuses
two
separate
statutory
provisions,
your
honor.
section
2518(8),
which
allows
the
continuation
of
a
secrecy
order,
allows
that
secrecy
order
to
be
continued
for
good
cause,
and
that
good
cause
can
include
any
number
of
things,
including
protecting
the
integrity
of
an
ongoing
criminal
investigation.
under
2232(c),
if
i
were
to
disclose
an
expired
wiretap
which
i
found
out
about
wrongfully
for
the
purpose
of
interfering
with
the
criminal
investigation
and
not
with
a
wiretap,
which
i
know
to
be...
to
have
been...
to
expire,
i
would
not
violate
the
statute.
there
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
statute,
because
i
would
not
have
satisfied
the
intent
provision,
and
the
problem
with
judge
hall's
analysis
is
i
think
she
collapses
section
2518
under
section
2232(c).
i
think
looking
at
it
precisely
the
opposite
way,
the
government's
construction
of
this
statute
would
lead
to
altogether
absurd
results,
which
is
that
if
an
individual
under
section
2518
were
to
receive
notice
of
the
existence
of
a
wiretap
and
were
mistakenly
to
believe
that
that
statutory
notice
under
section
2518
meant
that
a
wiretap
was
still
possible,
or
might,
indeed,
be
in
existence,
and
were
to
disclose
that
fact
for
the
purpose
of
thwarting
the
wiretap,
under
the
government's
view
of
the
statute,
that
individual
who
has
received
required
statutory
notice
would
violate
section
2232(c).
it
would
lead
to
an
absolutely
absurd
result
in
which,
of
course,
there's
no
possibility
of
harm.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
