justice
antonin
scalia
was
he
charged
under,
what
is
it,
1001,
for
simply
making
false
statements
to
an
executive
official
in
the
performance
of
his
duties?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
have
applied,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
it's
still
redundant.
doesn't
"endeavor"
bring
in
intent?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
read
you
an
entry
in
black's
law
dictionary?
"corruptly.
"
"when
used
in
a
statute,
this
term
generally
imports
a
wrongful
design
to
acquire
some
pecuniary
or
other
advantage.
"
it
appears
in
a
lot
of
statutes,
and
it
usually
means
by
bribery,
to
do
it
corruptly.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words
i
think
what
justice
ginsburg
and
i
are
asking
is,
how
much
of
a...
you
say
it's
a
catch-all.
how
much
of
a
catch-all
is
this
last
clause?
it
doesn't
say,
whoever
misleads,
it
says
who
only
does
it
in
certain
ways,
corruptly,
or
by
threats
of
force,
or
by
any
threatening
letter
or
communication.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
even
would
expire
and
a
new
one
be
authorized.
it
doesn't
say,
"such
authorization".
it
says,
"such
interception".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we've
been
discussing
it
as
though
it
said,
"such
authorization".
that's
really
not
what
it
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
get
all
of
this
out
of
the
word
"corruptly"?
you
say
"corruptly"
does--
justice
antonin
scalia
--does
handle
destroying
evidence,
it
does
cover
that,
but
it
does
not
cover
lying.
i
don't...
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
say
so,
but
i
don't
know
why
the
language
leads
you
to
that
conclusion.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
relying
on
"corruptly"
for
it,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
well,
what
do
you
rely
on
"corruptly"
for,
anything?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you...
well,
but
you
did
on
page
22
of
your
brief:
finally,
even
if
in
some
circumstances
section
1503
might
be
read
as
to
cover
a
prospective
witness,
blah,
blah,
blah,
a
mere
false
statement
is
not
one
of
those.
the
phrase
"corruptly"
endeavors
to
influence,
blah,
blah,
blah,
on
which
the
government
relies,
should
not
be
construed
in
isolation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
"corruptly"
that
makes
any
difference
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
becomes
more
corrupt
if
it's...
if
it's
greater
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems--
--mr.
luskin,
you've
referred
several
times
to
the
michael
case.
do
you
cite
that
in
your
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
assert
that
that--
--did
you
ask
for
an
instruction
on...
i'm
sorry.
you
don't
assert
that
that
doesn't
exist
here,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
not
proximate
enough,
so
it
wouldn't
even
be
covered
by
1512?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
successfully.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
anything
could
be
charged
under
1512.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
luskin,
you're
discussing
possible
interception
as
though
it
means
possible
interception.
you
cannot
give
notice
of
a
possible
interception
of
something
that
does
not
exist.
surely
the
phrase,
possible
interception,
means
the
possibility
of
interception,
does
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
give
notice
of
an
interception
that
does
not
now
exist
and
may
never
exist,
it
is
just
possible?
you
cannot
possibly
give
notice
of
a
possible
interception.
you
can
give
notice
of
the
possibility
of
interception,
to
be
sure.
isn't
that
what
it
reasonably
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
it
be
the
existence
of
a
possible
interception?
when
you
say
it's
a
possible
interception,
you're
saying
it
doesn't
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet
you're
giving
notice
of
the
existence
of
something
that
doesn't
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
possibility
of
interception,
is
what
you're
giving
notice
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
about
the
last
example
that
mr.
luskin
gave
about
someone
who
receives
notice
of
a
wiretap
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
for
that,
though,
you'd
have
him.
