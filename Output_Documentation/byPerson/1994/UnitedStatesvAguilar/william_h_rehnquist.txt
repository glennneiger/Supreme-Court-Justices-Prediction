we'll
hear
argument
now

number
94-270,
united
state
against
aguilar.
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
charge
to
the
jury
with
respect
to
the
1503,
would
that
have
been
different
if
the
respondent
had
been
indicted
under
1512?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
could
respondent
perhaps
be
retried
under
1512
without
the
bar
of
the
statute
of
limitations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
were
some
changes
made
in
1503--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--at
the
time
1512
was
enacted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
luskin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
congress
in
1982,
mr.
luskin,
impliedly
narrowed
the
omnibus
clause
of
1503?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
took
witnesses
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how,
mechanically,
did
congress
accomplish
this
process
of
narrowing
the
omnibus
clause?
it
didn't
rewrite
any
of
the
language
in
the
omnibus
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
perfectly
good
argument
for
saying
it
shouldn't
be
used
that
way
after
1982,
but
it's
not
a
very
good
argument
for
saying
that
congress
changed
the
meaning
of
the
clause
in
1982.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
congress
was
trying
to--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
but
of
course
the
doctrine
of
implied
repeal
is
disfavored,
and
as
i
understood
it,
you're
not...
are
you
relying
here
on
the
doctrine
of
implied
repeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
was
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
a
citation
now
for
the
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
intent
did
the
jury
have
to
find
in
order
to
convict
judge
aguilar
on
the
counts
that
it
did?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
jury
found
that
it
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
we
review
evidence
after
conviction
in
a
light
most
favorable
to
the
government,
do
we
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
luskin.
mr.
feldman,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
number
94-270
united
states
v.
aguilar.
a
jury
convicted,
respondent
district
judge
aguilar
based
on
allegations
that
judge
aguilar
assisted
a
convicted
felon
to
get
a
conviction
set
aside.
specifically,
the
judge
informed
a
friend
of
the
felon
that
the
government
had
taped
that
friend's
phone
under
its
investigation.
the
jury
convicted
judge
aguilar
of
legally
disclosing
information
he
had
learned
from
a
wiretap
application
under
section
2232
of
the
criminal
court.
even
though
the
wiretap
had
unbenounced
to
him
already
expired
at
the
time
he
made
the
disclosure
and
although
also
when
questioned
by
the
fbi
regarding
the
events
in
question
the
respondent
lie
to
the
fbi
agents.
for
this
the
jury
convicted
him
of
endeavoring
to
obstruct
the
due
administration
of
justice
under
section
1503
of
the
criminal
court.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
sitting
in
bank
reverse
both
convictions.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today
we
affirm
the
ninth
circuit
in
part
and
reverse
it
in
part.
in
the
first
part
of
the
opinion
joined
by
six
members
of
the
court,
we
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
that
respondent’s
conduct
cannot
be
punished
as
an
endeavor
to
obstruct
justice,
but
for
different
reasons
in
the
ninth
circuit
is
subscribed
to.
various
courts
of
appeals
in
reliance
on
our
early
decision
in
pettibone
v.
united
states
have
construed
section
1503
to
limit
the
very
broad
language
of
the
so-called
omnibus
clause
under
which
respondent
was
convicted.
although,
actions
taken
by
a
defendant
must
reflect
an
intent
to
influence
grand
jury
proceedings,
any
punishable
endeavor
must
also
have
the
natural
and
probable
effect
if
interfering
with
those
proceedings.
here
the
government
failed
to
prove
that
element
of
the
offense.
we
therefore
affirm
to
that
portion
of
the
ninth
circuit’s
decision.
we
disagree
however
with
the
ninth
circuit’s
disposition
of
the
wiretap
charge
in
an
opinion
joined
by
eight
members
of
the
court.
section
2232(c)
prohibits
the
disclosure
of
information
that
a
wiretap
has
been
sought
or
authorized.
the
statute
requires
the
defendant
know
an
authorization
requires
for
a
wire
interception
has
been
made
or
granted
and
that
the
defendant
disclose
such
information
with
intent
to
obstruct
“such
interception”
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
respondent’s
argument
that
the
disclosure
of
expired
wiretaps
cannot
possibly
impede
such
interceptions,
fails
in
the
phase
of
the
statutory
language
we
think.
the
statutory
phrase,
possible
interception
with
intended
to
punish
the
situation
where
a
defendant
discloses
a
wiretap
application
that
is
not
being
granted
and
thus
does
not
know
whether
interception
will
ever
occur.
respondent’s
reading
of
the
statute
would
create
numerous
unintended
defenses
based
on
impossibility.
we
therefore
reverse
that
portion
of
the
ninth
circuit’s
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
from
this
portion
of
the
court’s
opinion.
