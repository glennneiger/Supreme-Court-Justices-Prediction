justice

day
o'connor
mr.
feldman,
no
charge
was
brought
under
section
1512,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
the
conduct
here
would
have
been
covered
by
1512?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
might
have
fitted
it
rather
closely.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
was
no
charge
brought
under
that
section,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
feldman,
your
time
is
going
to
be
up
shortly,
and
there
was
another
section
under
which
the
defendant
was
charged,
section
2232(c),
giving
notice
or
attempting
to
give
notice
of
a
possible
wiretap
interception.
is
it
your
theory
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
an
attempt
to
give
notice,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
over
the
fact
that
at
the
time
of
the
defendant's
action
the
wiretap
authorization
had
terminated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
some
disagreement
in
the
lower
courts
about
the
impossibility
question?
i
gather
there
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
disagree
with
you
that
somehow
the
amendment
of
section
1512
affected
the
meaning
of
the
omnibus
clause
in
1503,
if
we
disagree
on
that,
do
you
place
reliance
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
1503?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
something
that
you
tell
a
witness
that
you
know
is
going
to
testify
at
the
proceeding,
hoping
to
affect
the
proceeding,
can
have
that
nexus.
i
don't
accept
that...
your
theory
is
that
no
statement
to
a
witness
could
possibly
affect
a
juror
or
judge.
i
think
it
could.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
don't
think
that
1503
is
limited
by
the
need
to
use
a
bribe
or
a
threat
of
violence
or
something
of
that
kind?
