justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
fbi
agents
testify
before
that
grand
jury,
the
ones
that
talked
to
him
in
honolulu?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
any
showing,
or
was
it
the
government's
theory
that
they
were
more
or
less
in
charge
of
bringing
the
matter
to
the
grand
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
object
to
the
instruction
and
submit
an
instruction
which
encapsulated
the
theory
that
you've
just
presented
to
justice
breyer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
clear
to
me
why
there's
no
necessary
nexus
between
the
success
for
the
outcome
of
the
grand
jury
investigation
and
giving...
trying
to
lead
the
fbi
agents
down
a
false
trail.
i'm
not
sure
why
there
isn't
that
proximate
connection
that
you
say
is
necessary
for
a
conviction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
government
abandons
the
grand
jury
investigation
because
it's
been
led
down
a
false
trail,
you
say
that's
not
impeding
the
due
administration
of
justice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
hypothetical
is
that
the
two
are
linked.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
fact
one
of
the
agents
did
testify,
didn't
he?
