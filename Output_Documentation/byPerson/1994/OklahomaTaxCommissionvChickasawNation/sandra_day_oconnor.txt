well,
mr.
rothfeld,
now,
this
hayden-cartwright
act
point
was
not
raised
below,
or
dealt
with.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
would
require
us
to
interpret
the
meaning
of
"reservation"
within
that
act
i
guess
for
the
first
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
was
nothing
express
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
here
that
referred
us
to
the
hayden-cartwright
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
broad
is
the
sweep
of
this
treaty
in
your
view?
what
about
an
indian
who...
a
tribal
member
who
lives
off
the
reservation
and
owns
property
off
the
reservation
and
is
asked
to
pay
a
property
tax?
