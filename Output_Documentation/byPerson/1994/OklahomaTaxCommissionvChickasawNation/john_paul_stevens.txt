mr.
arrow,
can
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--probably
a
stupid
question,
but
does
the
place
where
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
falls
determine
whether
the
consumer
or
the
dealer
can
deduct
the
payment
for
federal
income
tax
purposes?
does
it
have
any
independent
significance,
is
what
i'm
really
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's...
what
difference...
does
it
make
any
difference
other
than
for
this
deciding
whether
the
indian
tribes
have
to
pay
the
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
either
event,
even
if
the
retailer
isn't
the
taxpayer
in
a
technical
sense,
it
still
can
have
a
statutory
obligation
to
collect
the
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
have
to
confess
that
the
thing
that
keeps
running
through
my
mind
is,
as
i
remember
the
moe
case,
the
court
said
the
tribe
cannot
market
its
tax
exemption
by
selling
to
nonmembers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
answer
to
that
is,
they
can
do
it
if...
they
can
market
the
tax
exemption
if
the
incidence
of
the
tax
falls
on
the
retailer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
an
economic
sense
you
certainly
are--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
you're
able
to
sell
it
cheaper
than
the
retailers
who
must
pay
the
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
don't
have
the
per
se
rule,
supposing
it's
not
a
sale
to
a
consumer.
suppose
they
went
into
the
hotel
business.
they
opened
a
hotel,
or
a
ski
resort,
right
on
the
reservation.
could
oklahoma
tax
the
income
and
the
property
and
everything
else
from
that
activity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that
i...
maybe
it's
obvious,
but
why
is
it...
supposing
the
ski
resort
attracts
skiers
from
all
over
the
state,
most
of
whom
are
not
indians,
and
don't
they
market
their
tax
exemption
if
they
don't
have
to
pay
any
taxes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you...
well,
okay.
