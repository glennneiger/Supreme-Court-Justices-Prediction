mr.
rothfeld,
most
of
these
gas
stations,
i
understand
it,
are
in
indian
territory
but
not
on
the
reservation.
i
mean,
the
most
this
statute
would
show
is
that
the
reservation
was...
is
excluded.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
means
indian
territory?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
land
law,
but
this
is
not
land
law.
when
you
say,
united
states
military
or
other
reservation,
i
hardly
think
that
that
refers
to
indian
territory,
apart
from
indian
reservations.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
least,
it's
highly
questionable
that
it
does.
that's
even
assuming
that
it
covers
indian
reservations
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any...
i
mean,
you're
talking
economic
realities.
is
there
any
such
thing
as
a
tax
upon
a
retailer,
or
a
tax
upon
a
business?
any
tax
upon
a
business
is
going
to
be
passed
downward
to
the
maximum
extent
possible.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
don't
we
have
to
determine
it
on
formalistic
bases?
it's
going
to
end
up,
the
purchaser's
going
to
pay
for
it
one
way
or
another.
you're
telling
me
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
tax
on
a
retailer,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
saying
if
you
do
that
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
tax
on
a
retailer,
because
a
retailer
will
always
pass
the
tax
downward
to
the
maximum
extent
possible.
unless,
as
a
matter
of
form,
he
is
required
to
collect
penny
for
penny
from
the
consumer,
there's
no
such
thing.
he's
going
to
pass
it
down
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
claim
this
is
a
question
of
federal
law?
where
the
oklahoma
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
is
a
question
of
federal
law,
or
it's
a
question
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
they
have
to
be
able
to
determine
what
the
oklahoma
law
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
we
not
just
accept
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
question
of
state
law,
as
we
usually
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
what
i
understand
you
want
us
to
look
to.
you
don't
want
us
to
look
to
whom
the
legislature
intended
to
saddle
with
the
tax.
what
do
you
want
us
to
look
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
actually
ends
up
paying
the
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
were
arguing
to
us
that
it
was
unrealistic
to
view
the
incidence
of
the
tax
as
being
on
one
party
or
the
other,
and
now
you're
saying
it
doesn't
matter
who
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on,
you
should
just
be...
just
look
at
the
scheme
and
see
if
it's
hurting
the
tribes
too
much.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
haven't
said
that,
you've
said
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
asked
you
how
you
determined
who
bears
the
incidence
of
the
tax.
you
reject
formalism.
you
reject
who
the
state
says
must
pay
it.
you
ask
us
to
simply
decide
who
gets
hurt
by
it.
you're
the
one
that's
proposing
this,
not
our
prior
decisions.
if
you
look
at
who
ends
up...
out
of
whose
pocket
it
ultimately
comes,
it
ultimately
comes
out
of
the
tribe's
pocket.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
about
the
two
provisions
of
law
mentioned
by
your
opponent?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
definition
section
and
the
exemption
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
something
on
36.
you're
not
talking
about
501b?
justice
antonin
scalia
"provides
that"...
it's
about
a
third
of
the
way
down
the
page...
"purchasers
of
nontaxable
diesel
fuel
must
comply
with
the
provisions
of
section
509
in
order
to
avoid
the
taxes
levied
by
sections
501.
"
--is
that
it?
that
is
on
page
36.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
about
c.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
owe
it
to
themselves,
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean,
if
i
take
money
out
of
one
pocket
and
put
it
in
my
other,
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
saying
they're
not
using
it
to
sell
more
gas.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
just
using
it
to
make
more
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
anybody
in
the
state,
other
than
indians,
who
market
more
gas
by
charging
less
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
i'm
from
the
east
here,
and
i'm
always
used
to
seeing,
you
know,
the
tax
price
and
then
it
says,
you
know,
plus
3,
plus
2,
whatever
the
tax
is.
plus
4.
plus
4,
whatever
it's
gotten
up
to
now.
it's
not
like
that
in
oklahoma?
it
just
says,
you
know,
flat
price,
and
you
can
bargain?
you
can
bargain
the
price
down?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
if
the
incidence
were
not
on
the
purchaser,
i
would
expect
that
some
people
would
charge
the
tax
and
some
people
wouldn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there's
no--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if...
no,
if
the
incidence
were
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
the
purchaser.
i
expect
that
some
people
simply
wouldn't
charge
any
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
gas
stations
don't
show
a
tax
charge,
is
what
you're
telling
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
get
that
out
of
the
statute?
i
mean,
i
would
think
if
you're
interpreting
the
statute
as
broadly
as
you
ask
us
to...
or
the
treaty,
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
basis
of
just
its
language,
i
would
think
you'd
have
to
say
that
a
member
of
the
tribe
wouldn't
have
to
obey
general
state
laws.
he's
a
descendant
of
the
tribe
that
was
given
these
guarantees.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
that
what
it
meant
to
them
at
that
time
is
that
an
indian
who
was
living
in
indian
country
was
not
subject
to
state
regulation,
taxes
or
anything
else,
but
the
one
who
was
living
outside
of
indian
country
would
be
subject
to
state
regulation
and
state
taxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
draw
the
line
just
for
purposes
of
taxes?
how
can
you
get
that
out
of
this
statute?
it
seems
to
me
if
you
say
that
an
indian
off
of
the
reservation
or
out
of
indian
country
cannot
be
taxed,
it
seems
to
me
you
would
also
say
he
cannot
be
regulated
in
any
other
fashion.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
nice
line
you're
drawing.
i
mean,
it
may
be
a
wonderful
line,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
treaty
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
of
the
descendents
of
the
chickasaw...
it
seems
to
me
you're
governing
the
descendents
of
the
chickasaw
nation
if
you
regulate
their
conduct,
whether
with
regard
to
charging
them
an
income
tax,
or
with
regard
to
preventing
certain
actions
of
theirs
by
reason
of
criminal
law,
or
anything
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
want
us
to
give
this
a
liberal
interpretation,
it
means
that
nobody
will
govern
the
descendents
of
the
chickasaw
nation.
it's
clear
what
that
means.
you
don't
govern
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
good
line.
i
just
don't
see
it
anywhere
in
the
text
of
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
reason
they
did
it,
mr.
rothfeld,
is
they
were
worried
that
it
would
prejudice
this
litigation.
by
changing
the
rule,
they
would
in
effect
be
admitting
that
it
wasn't
already
that
way.
