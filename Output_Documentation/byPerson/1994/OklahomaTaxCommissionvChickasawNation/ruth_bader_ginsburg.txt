mr.
rothfeld,
even
if
you're
right
that
the
court
could
entertain
this
statutory
argument,
isn't
it
extraordinary
for
this
court
to
be
a
court
of
first
view?
very
often,
the
court
won't
even
address
a
question
clearly
raised
by
a
petition,
it
will
wait
for
a
circuit
split,
but
you're
asking
this
court
to
jump
in
and
interpret
this
statute
before
anyone
else
has,
and
that's
quite
unusual.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
might
also
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
say,
we
leave
that
question
to
one
side
because
it
has
not
aired
before
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
then
that
if
this
pending
law,
or
this
law
that
is
now
dead,
had
passed,
there'd
be
no
difference
at
all
in
substance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
difference
that
the
consumer
can
see
between
what
would
have
been
if
this
law
had
passed
and
what
is?
now,
the
formal
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
retailer.
if
it
had
been
placed
on
the
consumer,
would
there
be
any
difference
in
what
the
consumer
would
see
at
the
pump,
say?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
arrow--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
about
the
member
of
the
tribe
that
lives
in
the
town,
that's
the
one
we're
talking
about,
who
can
vote
in
the
town
as
a
resident,
whose
children
can
go
to
school
there,
who
gets
fire,
police,
all
protection,
why
should
that
person
not
have
to
pay
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
there's
any
consequence
for
federal
tax
purposes
placing
the
incidence
on
the
retailer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there's
no
difference,
how
do
you
explain
the
reluctance
of
the...
or
the
nonaction
by
the
senate
in
killing
this
bill?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oklahoma.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
since
that
would
clarify
it
for
the
future,
there
wouldn't
be
any
possible
doubt.
why
wouldn't
they
just
go
ahead
and
do
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
second
decision
i
have
to
announce
is
oklahoma
tax
commission
against
chickasaw
nation,
94-771.
this
case
concerns
the
taxing
authority
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
as
it
bears
on
the
chickasaw
nation,
a
federally
recognized
indian
tribe
and
all
members
of
the
tribe,
taxes
of
two
kinds
are
at
issue.
first,
oklahoma’s
exercise
tax
on
motor
fuels,
second
the
state
income
tax.
the
us
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
oklahoma
may
not
apply
the
state’s
motor
fuels
tax
to
retail
sales
made
by
chickasaw
nation
convenient
stores
located
on
tribal
land.
the
tenth
circuit
also
held
that
oklahoma
may
not
apply
its
income
tax
to
wages
of
members
of
the
tribe
who
are
employed
and
paid
by
the
tribe
but
who
reside
in
oklahoma
outside
indian
country.
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
on
the
motor
fuels
tax
but
reverse
the
tenth
circuit’s
decision
regarding
the
income
tax.
concerning
the
motor
fuels
tax,
it
is
central
law
when
congress
does
not
instruct
otherwise
that
an
exercise
tax
is
un-impossible
if
its
legal
incidence
falls
on
a
tribe
or
its
members
for
sales
made
within
indian
country.
the
court
of
appeals
reasonably
determined
that
the
legal
incidence
of
oklahoma’s
fuels
tax
falls
on
the
retailer
not
on
the
wholesaler,
not
on
the
consumer.
we
therefore
hold
that
the
state’s
tax,
as
it
is
currently
designed,
cannot
be
collected
for
sales
made
at
the
tribe’s
retail
stores.
so,
holding,
we
decline
to
consider
the
argument
that
the
federal
hayden-cartwright
act
expressly
authorizes
states
to
tax
motor
fuels
sales
made
on
indian
reservation.
oklahoma
did
not
raise
this
point
in
the
lower
courts
or
in
its
petition
for
review
and
we
will
not
fit
as
a
court
of
first
instance
to
resolve
the
matter.
our
decision
as
to
the
fuels
tax
is
unanimous.
turning
to
the
state
income
tax
question,
we
hold
that
oklahoma
may
tax
the
wages
of
the
chickasaw
nation
and
members
of
the
chickasaw
nation,
who
are
employed
and
paid
by
the
tribe
but
reside
within
the
state
of
oklahoma
outside
indian
country.
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
the
tribe
guarantees
the
tribe
and
its
members
that
no
territory
or
state
shall
ever
have
a
right
to
pass
laws
for
the
government
of
the
chickasaw
nation.
but
that
provision
does
not
displays
the
general
principle,
which
holds
way
both
interstate
and
internationally
that
a
sovereign
may
tax
the
income
from
all
sources
of
those
who
reside
within
its
borders.
on
the
application
of
oklahoma’s
income
tax,
the
members
of
the
tribe
who
work
for
the
tribe
but
live
outside
indian
country,
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
o'connor
and
souter
joined.
