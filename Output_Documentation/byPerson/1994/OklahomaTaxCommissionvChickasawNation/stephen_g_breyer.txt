justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
respondents
say
that
we
should
dismiss
this
as
improvidently
granted.
do
you
know
the
status
of
the
legislation,
and
is
what
you
just
were
talking
about
an
added
reason
for
doing
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
if
it's
the
effect,
isn't
it
going
to
be
adverse
to
the
tribe
no
matter
who
you
put
it
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
so
i
mean,
if
you
really
want
us
to
look
to
the
economic
effect,
i
take
it
if
there
are
only
a
few
gas
stations
owned
by
the
tribe,
and
prices
are
competitive,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
gas
stations
elsewhere
in
the
state,
that
whether
you
say
the
consumer
is
paying
it
or
whether
you
say
the
distributor
is
paying
it,
or
whether
you
say
somebody
else
is
paying
it,
in
the
absence
of
the
tax,
the
tribe
could
charge
more
money,
which
they'd
keep,
and
in
the
presence
of
the
tax,
they'll
have
to
give
that
extra
money
to
the
government.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
point
is,
if
you
look
at
the
formality
of
it,
the
formality
isn't
on
the
tribe,
is
it,
or
is
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
the
formality
is
you
don't
win
on
that
one,
and
if
you
look
at
the
reality,
you
don't
win
on
that
one,
either.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
isn't
the
economic...
that's
my
question.
if
the
price
is
$1
a
gallon
and
it's
set
by
competition
all
over
the
state,
and
20
cents
of
that
dollar
is
going
to
the
state
government,
i
guess
the
tribe
also
can
charge
$1
a
gallon,
because
that's
the
competitive
price,
and
if
they
don't
have
to
pay
20
cents
out
of
that
dollar
to
the
state,
they
can
keep
it,
and
so
those
are
the
economic
circumstances.
no
matter
who
you
say
this
tax
is
being
borne
by,
the
reality
is
it
would
be
borne
by
the
tribe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
the
reason
that
they
didn't
pass
it
because
they
didn't
want
to
moot
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
speak
for
the
tax
commission.
well,
it
wouldn't
moot
the
case
as
to
past
tax
obligations,
would
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
it
your
view
that
the
only
reason...
if
it
made
no
difference,
it's
hard
to
see
why
they
didn't
pass
it,
unless
they
were
worried
that
it
might
make
the
significance
of
this
case
less
significant
and
maybe
we
would
dismiss
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
given
your
new
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
a
weakness,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
i
mean,
but
that's...
if
this
is
a
tactical
concern
of
one
kind
or
another,
which
is
what
i'm
curious
about...
i'm
not
saying
it
expresses
a
weakness
in
the
case...
i
think
that
might
be
relevant,
if
that
is
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there's
a
problem
for
us
in
this
case
in
that
there's
a
new
issue
brought
that
wasn't
argued
below
that
isn't
obvious
how
it
comes
out
one
way
or
the
other,
yet
is
determinative,
and
so
that
makes
it
a
harder
matter
to
reach
the
issue
that
this
was
granted
cert
to
decide,
and
in
the
meantime,
it's
additionally
confused
because
they
could
moot...
or
not
moot
it,
but
they
could
get
rid
of
the
problem
by
changing
the
law,
and
so
that
somehow
feeds
into
this
mix,
too--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
that's
why
i
ask
the
question.
