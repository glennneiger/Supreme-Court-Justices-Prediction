mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
counsel
for
the
tax
commission
has
made
clear,
this
case
involves
two
questions.
with
the
court's
permission,
we
would
first
turn
to
the
fuel
tax
question,
reserving
the
treaty
question
with
relation
to
the
income
tax
until
later
in
this
argument.
with
respect
to
the
fuel
tax,
we
would
like
to
make
four
points
before
this
court.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
below
is
entitled
to
deference
with
regard
to
its
interpretation
of
state
law.
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
characterized
this
as
a
state
law
question.
we
on
the
respondent's
side,
representing
the
chickasaw
nation,
understand
that
this
is
primarily
a
state
law
question.
we
agree
with
that
proposition.
obviously,
as
the
chief
justice
has
just
pointed
out,
there
is
a
federal
component
to
the
extent
that
this
court
in
chemehuevi
established
foursquare
the
proposition
that
the
absence
of
an
express
pass-through
provision
in
a
state
tax
does
not
mean,
ipso
facto
and
a
fortiori,
that
the
resultant
tax
is
not
a
consumer
tax.
that
is
the
federal
component
of
the
rule.
beyond
that,
this
court
has
treated
those
questions
as
state
law
questions,
and
in
cases
too
numerous
to
cite,
but
one
which
we
have
mentioned
in
our
brief
is
haring
v.
prosise,
this
court
has
indicated
that
it
is
this
court's
practice
to
accept
conclusions
of
courts
of
appeals
with
respect
to
questions
of
state
law
even
if
independent
examination
might
have
justified
a
different
conclusion.
that's
the
first
point
that
we
would
like
to
make
with
respect
to
the
fuel
tax.
this
takes
us
to
the
second
point,
which
is
that
independent
examination
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
by
this
court
in
this
case
on
the
state
law
question
with
reference
to
the
incidence
of
the
fuel
tax
would
not
justify
a
different
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals
conclusion
that
the
incidence
of
the
fuel
tax
is,
in
fact,
on
retailers,
in
this
case
the
chickasaw
nation,
the
retail
indian
tribe.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
say
in
answer
to
that
that
while
it
might
be
theoretically
possible
that
a
retailer
might
choose
to
"absorb"
part
of
the
tax
and
therefore
there
might
be
some
theoretical
difference,
our
inclination
is
the
same
as
the
implications
of
justice
scalia's
question,
which
is
that
you
know,
can
you
really
see
any
difference
between
the
tax
and
the...
regardless
of
where
the
incidence
would
be,
and
the
answer
might
well
be
no.
with
respect
to
justice
scalia's
question
of
counsel,
we
would
simply
invoke
along
this
very
same
line
what
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
in
opposition
at
page
17,
wherein
we
quote
an
argument
which
had
been
made
by
the
tax
commission
in
the
court
of
appeals
below.
this
is
on
page
17
of
the
brief
in
opposition
in...
at
line
3
of
page
17.
petitioner's
own
earlier
argumentation
expressly
noted
that
the
search
for
taxes
included
in
the
wholesale
price
could
look
back
forever,
and
for
the
same
reasons
it
could
look
forward
forever
for
the
same
reason
as
well,
and
so
our
answer
would
be
to
incline
to
answer
justice
ginsburg's
question
in
the
negative.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor.
this--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--that's
right.
the
petitioner
tax
commission
has
made
a
great
deal
of
the
fact
that
section
501c
is
in
a
so-called
definitional
section
of
the
statute.
when
one
examines
that
beyond
the
superficial
characterization
of
the
word,
501
of
the
statute
which
begins
the
fuel
tax
scheme
has
the
word
"definitions"
in
the
heading.
when
one
looks
at
501c,
one
finds
that
what
501c
is
definitional
of
is
storage,
and
so
to
the
extent
that
one
finds
it
in
the
definitional
provision
of
the
statute,
counsel
for
petitioner
tax
commission
and
the
tax
commission
itself
has
attempted
to
indicate
that
there
is
some
talismanic
aspect
of
the
fact
that
we
find
section
501c
in
a
definitional
provision,
but
the
definition
is
one
of
storage.
we
have
a
specific
answer
to
that
also.
it
simply
states,
and
i'm
quoting
from
section
501c,
the
critical
proposition
advanced
by
the
tax
commission,
nothing
in
this
section
shall--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
specifically
i
would
refer
the
court
to
section...
the
blue
brief,
to
the
brief
of
petitioner
at
page
36,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor.
where
they
are
quoting...
36
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner,
yes,
your
honor.
section
501...
a
definitional
provision
of
the
statute
at
about
line
12
of
the
page.
your
honor,
i
fail
to
find
it
in
the
brief
of
petitioner
at
this
point.
it
is
cited
in
our
brief,
but
i
don't
have
the
page
in
front
of
me.
i
apologize,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
501b,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
that...
i
believe
that
may
be
a...
that
may
be
a
misquotation.
i
believe
they're
referring
to
501a
at
that
point,
or
501b,
pardon
me.
i'm
talking
about
501c,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
i'm
given
the
petition
by
cocounsel.
at
page
39a
of
the
petition,
and
at
page
39a,
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
page,
"nothing
in
this
section
shall
require
a
distributor,
dealer,
or
retailer
to
collect.
"
and
the
tax
commission
relies
heavily
on
the
fact
that
it
indicates
that
somehow
retailers
collect.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
in
chief
that
this
simply
requires
a
negative
inference,
that
petitioner
is
attempting
to
draw
a
negative
inference
from
this
that
something
else
requires
payment
of
the
tax
by
a
consumer,
which
is
absolutely
not
the
case.
we
point
out
further
that
the
provisions
which
are
really
definitional
as
to
the
incidence
of
the
fuel
tax
are
largely
section
505
of
the
statute,
specifically
section
505c,
and
also
section
506
of
the
statute,
which
provide...
and
these
are
cited
in
our
brief
in
chief...
which
provide
that
the
distributor
is
an
agent
of
the
state
for
collection
of
the
fuel
tax.
and
we
find,
as
we
have
indicated
in
the
rest
of
our
remaining
brief,
that
as
to
those
provisions,
section
505c
and
section
506,
as
well
as
section
507,
as
well
as
section
502,
there
are
numerous
provisions
which
are
ignored
by
the
tax
commission
which
establish
the
definition
of
where
the
legal
incidence
of
the
fuel
tax
is
rather
than
simply
carving
out
a
phrase
and
basing
their
argument
on
a
negative
implication
of
a
provision
of
the
statute
which
is
contained
in
the
definition
of
"storage".
we
submit
that
the
statute
taken
as
a
whole,
in
short,
even
though
there
is
that
possible
implication,
but
it
requires
a
negative
and
an
incorrect
implication,
that
nothing...
because
nothing
requires
a
distributor,
retailer,
or
dealer
to
collect,
that
something
else
requires
that
collection
be
from
consumers,
and
there
simply
is
no
pass-through
provision
to
consumers
anywhere
in
this
scheme,
express
or
implied.
with
respect
to
the
agricultural
exemption
which
is
cited,
and
this
is
the
second
provision
that
is
relied
upon
primarily
by
the
petitioner
tax
commission,
they
are
referring
to
the
agricultural
exemption
in
section
509
of
the
statute,
which
simply
states
that
anyone
who
is
claiming
an
agricultural
exemption
for
gasoline
to
be
used
for
farm
use
shall
not
be
required
to
pay...
"to
pay".
and
we
have
indicated
to
this
court,
having
recognized
the
significance
in
plain
meaning
in
text
before
this
court,
but
we
have
indicated
that
that
word,
which
by
the
way
was
inserted
in
1939...
and
we
have
researched
the
legislative
history.
there
is
nothing
which
indicates
any
intent
to
change
the
legal
incidence
of
fuel
tax
scheme
in
1939,
but
we
have
described
that
as
colloquial.
we
also
point
out
to
this
court
that
in
section
508b
of
the
statute
the
identical
provision
with
respect
to
the
aircraft
tax
indicates
that
the
exemption
is
one
which
can
be
claimed
by
the
distributor,
and
other
provisions
of
the
statute
are
silent
on
this
whatsoever,
but
the
critical
proposition
that
we
indicate,
and
the
critical
provisions
which
we
have
cited
to
this
court
which
affirmatively
establish
the
legal
incidence
of
the
fuel
tax,
are
section
505e
with
respect
to
diesel
fuel
tax.
section
505e
expressly
imposes
payment
obligations
on
retailers
or
dealers,
and
the
only
response
that
we've
seen
in
the
reply
brief
from
the
petitioner
tax
commission
is,
well,
that
only
applies
to
diesel
fuel,
that's
one,
and
secondly
the
hayden-cartwright
act.
those
are
the
only
answers
that
they
have
to
that,
because
it
is
expressed
in
that
provision,
section
505e
of
the
fuel
tax
statute,
that
under
those
circumstances
the
diesel
fuel
tax
is
clearly
to
be...
payment
obligations
are
imposed
on
retailers
or
dealers.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
i
am
not
aware
of
any
for
that
purpose,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
your
honor,
clearly
in
another
non-indian
context
this
court,
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
justice
souter
as
recently
as
the
jefferson
lines
case,
going
back
to
complete
auto
transit,
has
disregarded
the
formalities
involved
in
a
tax,
but
in
this
case,
we
submit
to
this
court
that
one
either
has
a
per
se
rule
in
this
complex
area,
or
one
does
not.
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
per
se
rule,
one
must
acknowledge
the
fact
that
the
legal
incidence
must
be
controlling
for
purposes
of
the
per
se
rule
if
the
per
se
rule
is
to
avoid
cumbersome
and
duplicative
litigation.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes.
yes,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that's
absolutely
right.
we
point
out
in
part,
specifically
along
those
lines,
that
they're
unlike
the
oklahoma
cigarette
tax,
unlike
the
california
cigarette
tax
at
issue
in
chemehuevi.
both
of
those
cases
contained
independent
obligations
on
the
parts
of
consumers
to
pay
for
untaxed
cigarettes
and
forbade
the
use
of
untaxed
cigarettes.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that...
in
1931,
your
honor,
the
legal
incidence
could
only
be
characterized
as
dual.
in
1931,
the
oklahoma
legislative
scheme
was
amended
to
include
a
situation
whereby
the
wholesaler
paid
the
tax
but
could,
at
its
option,
pass
the
tax
along
to
retailers,
and
so
both,
in
those
situations,
the
statutory
scheme
at
that
point
in
time
imposed
obligations
on
both.
in
1933,
during
the
dust
bowl,
and
by
the
best
of
our
research,
based
upon
what
we
found
with
references
to
defaulting
dealers
in
the
statute,
in
1933
the
incidence
clearly
is
moved
onto
wholesale...
onto
retailers,
pardon
me,
with
wholesale
distributors...
what
has
now
become
section
506
originated
in
1933...
with
wholesale
distributors
limited
specifically
to
agents
of
the
state
for
collection.
and
at
that
point,
they
still,
and
they
do
still
today,
have
an
independent
obligation
to
pay
over
to
the
state...
to
remit
is
the
technical
term
of
art
which
the
oklahoma
fuel
tax
code
uses...
to
remit
moneys
to
the
state
which
have
been
collected
from
retailers,
and
there
is
a
penalty
in
section
506
for
embezzlement.
not
for
tax
evasion
on
the
part
of
wholesalers,
but
rather
for
embezzlement
in
those
circumstances
where
wholesale
distributors
do
not
pay
over
to
the
state
that
money
which
we
have
collected,
but
there
are
independent
payment
obligations
on
retailers
also,
such
as
section
505e.
so
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
it
is
possible
that
they
both
have
obligations,
one
to
remit
moneys
that
it
has
collected,
as
the
statute
says,
as
the
agent
of
the
state,
and
moneys
which
it
holds
in
trust,
the
other
the
primary
obligation
to
pay,
but
in
no
sense
is
there
any
obligation
on
consumers,
and
that's
the
important
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
precisely,
your
honor.
precisely.
now,
of
course,
we
are
not
marketing
the
tax
exemption
in
a
loose
sense
of
the
term.
the
chickasaw
nation
and
all
the
other
tribes
of
the
state--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--well--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--well,
in
point
of
fact
that
doesn't
occur,
your
honor,
because
the
tribe
has
imposed
its
own
fuel
tax,
which
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
fuel
tax
imposed
by
the
state,
so
therefore
as
a
matter
of
economic
reality
in
this
particular
set
of
facts
there
is
no
economic
advantage
whatsoever.
every
tribe
in
the
state
has
done
the
same.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
well--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia,
but
the
distinction
being
there
is
no
marketing
and
exemption
from
the
standpoint
of
a
consumer
purchaser
having
any
artificial
inducement.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
correct,
and
our
position
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
is,
if
the
incidence
of
the
fuel
tax
is
on
the
retailer,
they
can
do
that.
the
premise
of
the
moe
and
colville
cases
was
that
the
incidence
of
the
fuel
taxes
there
was
on
the
consumers,
and
this
court
had
expressly
so
found
and
had
been
supported
by
lower
court
interpretations
of
state
law
in
both
of
those
cases,
and
as
questions
have
indicated--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--who
market
more
gas
by
charging
less
tax?
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
no.
i
have
not
successfully
negotiated
yet,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
if
the
incidence--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--if
the
incidence
were
not
on
the
retailer,
your
honor?
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
not
on
the
purchaser.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
well--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--yes.
again,
justice
scalia,
with
respect
to
your
question
of
a
while
ago,
with
respect
to
your
question
as
to
whether
there's
really
any
such
thing
from
a
standpoint
of
economic
reality,
you
know,
the
question,
i
suppose,
might
rhetorically
be,
is
there
any
difference
between
not
charging
a
portion
of
the
tax
and
simply
cutting
profits
1
or
2
cents,
you
know,
and
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
that's
part
of
my
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
as
well.
if
i
might,
your
honor,
i
notice
that
my
5-minute
light
has
come
on,
i'd
like
to
move
to
the
treaty
question
very
briefly,
which
has
not
been
yet
addressed
in
this
oral
argument
before
the
court.
we'd
like
to
make
about
four
points
about
the
treaty,
very
briefly
your
honor.
first
of
all,
we'd
like
to
focus
on
the
characteristics
of
this
treaty,
which
are
extraordinarily
unique
in
the
history
of
the
united
states.
the
history,
which
we
have
recounted
in
some
detail
over
about
the
first
11
pages
of
our
brief
in
chief,
is
very
unique
with
respect
to
the
relations
between
the
united
states
and
the
choctaw
nation.
that
treaty,
the
treaty
of
dancing
rabbit
creek,
is,
of
course,
the
treaty
to
which
the
chickasaw
nation
later
becomes
beneficiary
by
treaty
in
1837.
this
treaty,
and
this
has
not
been
contested
by
the
tax
commission,
involves
broader
guarantees
of
self-government
than
any
guarantees
than
had
ever
been
given
in
any
treaty
in
the
history
of
the
united
states.
this
is
an
uncontroverted
fact.
there
has
been
no
dispute
of
that
issue
by
the
tax
commission.
it
is
also--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--yes,
your
honor.
we
would
not
think
that
it
would
cover
that
situation.
we
think
that
the
significant
interpretive
aspects
of
this
is
that
first
of
all
it
involves
governmental
relationships
between
tribes
and
their
own
members,
and
secondly
that
it
involves
a
nexus
to
tribal
lands,
and
here
the
nexus
to
tribal
lands
is
that
the
indian
country
is
the
situs
of
the
place
where
the
governmental
activities
and
the
employment
occurs.
that
would
be
our
limiting
feature,
justice
o'connor.
in
terms
of
interpretation--
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
we
think
that
it's
possible
that
other,
broader
interpretations
could
be
made.
we,
as
well
as
the
tax
commission,
as
well
as
this
court,
have
thought
of
numerous
hypotheticals
which
could
go
beyond.
at
this
point,
we
confine
our
theory,
we
suspect
that
probably
many
of
those
theories
would
not
be
successful,
and
should
not
be
successful,
but
rather
than
attempting
to
litigate
the
possibilities,
we
have
simply
advanced
a
very
narrow
theory
before
this
court.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
yes,
i
understand
the
question,
justice
ginsburg.
the
answer
is,
this
court
in
sac
and
fox
addressed
at
least
part
of
that
question,
as
it
had
prior
to
that
in
mcclanahan.
in
sac
and
fox,
this
court
indicated
very
clearly
that
treaty
questions
aside,
and
other
questions
aside,
and
also
the
williams
v.
lee
infringement
question
aside,
residence
is
a
very
significant
component
of
a
presumption
of
the
per
se
rule
under
mcclanahan,
and
we
understand
that.
but
the
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
simply
no
difference,
because
chickasaw
tribal
members,
as
all
tribal
members,
are
eligible
for
state
services
whether
or
not
they
reside
in
indian
country,
so
to
the
extent
that
the
tax
commission
attempts
to
advance
the
proposition
that
somehow,
somehow
it
is
different
for
tribal
members
who
live
outside
of
indian
country,
that
they're
somehow
entitled
to
more
state
services
than
members
who
live
in
indian
country,
this
court
has
already
held
in
sac
and
fox
and
mcclanahan
that
those
who
work
and
reside
in
indian
country
are
already
exempt
from
state
income
taxation.
and
therefore
the
distinction,
for
this
purpose,
your
honor,
the
distinction
is
simply
a
distinction
without
a
difference
from
the
standpoint
of
whether
or
not
the
employee
of
the
government,
of
the
tribe,
lives
within
or
without
indian
country,
because
under
either
circumstance
they're
going
to
be
eligible
for
state
services,
and
under
those
circumstances,
there's
no
principled
basis
for
a
distinction
for
purposes
of
applying
the
treaty,
even
extending
the
treaty
to
cover
situations
which
this
court
has
not
yet
ruled
on
under
general
law
and
sac
and
fox.
mr.
dennis
w.
arrow
thank
you
very
much.
