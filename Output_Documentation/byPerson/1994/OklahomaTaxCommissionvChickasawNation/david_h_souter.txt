justice
david
h.
souter
your
references
to
doubt
i
guess
are
to
the
departmental
view
at
the
time.
we've
never
construed
it
to
cover
an
indian
reservation.
have
lower
courts
so
construed
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
have
you
cited
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
it's
one
which
i
gather
your
client
has
embodied
in
a
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
so?
i
mean,
under
oklahoma
law
the
taxpayer
here
is
deemed
to
be
in
this
case
the
retailer,
and
hence
the
tribe.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
don't
we
draw...
i
mean,
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it,
but
didn't
oklahoma
win
the
last
case
by
a
little
line-drawing
of
exactly
that
sort?
maybe
i
should
ask
whether
you
would
like
to
win
this
one,
or
for
us
to
go
back
and
adopt
the
dissent
in
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case
of
a
couple
of
weeks
ago.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
did
very
well
with
formal
line-drawing
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
pardon
me?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
that
might
be
its
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
did
not
focus
on
economic
effects.
i
mean,
that
was
one
reason
why
the
dissent
and
the
majority
parted
ways.
