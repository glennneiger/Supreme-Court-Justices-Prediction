mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
fuel
tax
issue.
our
position
is
that
the
court
should
resolve
that
issue
by
applying
the
principle
that
a
state
may
not
directly
tax
indian
activities
in
indian
country
except
where
congress
has
abrogated
tribal
immunity
in
explicitly...
excuse
me,
in
unmistakably
clear
terms.
applying
that
principle,
oklahoma
may
not
impose
its
fuel
tax
on
the
chickasaw
nation's
retailers,
because
congress
has
not
abrogated
tribal
immunity
in
this
area,
and
because
under
state
law
the
court
of
appeals
reasonably
concluded
that
legal
incidence
falls
on
the
retailer.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
absolutely.
it
is
legal
incidence
that
determines
whether
or
not
a
showing
of
congressional
abrogation
is
required.
if
the
tax
were
to--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
believe
it
is
correct.
i
mean,
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
distinction.
in
other
words,
in
moe
and
colville,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
tax...
the
determinative
factor
where
taxes
fell
on
the
purchaser
was
whether
the
purchaser
was
an
indian,
in
which
case
the
tax
could
not
be
imposed,
or
whether
it
was
on
a
non-indian,
so
there
was
legal
incidence
there,
as
in
chemehuevi,
that
was
the
decisive
factor.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
i
think
the
basis
for
the
per
se
rule,
which
relies
on
legal
incidence,
goes
back
historically
to
the
sovereign
immunity
that
tribes
have
had
under
the...
vis-a-vis
the
states
under
the
constitution.
it
also,
though,
as
the
court
noted
in
county
of
yakima
just
3
years
ago,
has
practical
justifications.
for
example,
one
of
them
is
that
it
serves
the
goal
of
predictability.
it
allows
both
states
and
tribes
alike
to
rely
categorically
on
the
presence
or
absence
of
congressional
authorization
in
determining
whether
a
tax
would
be
or
is
valid.
it
also
obviates
the
need
for
an
ongoing
inquiry
into
whether
the
balance
of
interests
that
at
one
point
may
have
justified
a
tax
has
changed
over
time,
if,
for
example,
it
is
shown
that
only
a
portion
of
a
given
tax
maybe
is
being
passed
along.
as
i
noted,
there
is
also
an
historical
dimension
to
it,
in
that
it
reflects
the
sovereign
immunity
the
tribes
have
under
the
constitution
vis-a-vis
the
states,
and
finally,
and
perhaps
this
is
most
important,
it
leaves
the
states
with
considerable
flexibility.
in
this
case,
all
oklahoma
need
do
is
to
change
the
legal
incidence
of
the
fuel
tax
to
make
sure
that
it
falls
on
the
ultimate
purchaser.
that
is
what
other
states
with
significant
indian
populations
have
done.
that's
so
they've
administered
their
tax
statutes
consistent
with
principles
of
indian
sovereignty.
i
think
this
case
is
very
much
like
citizen
band
potawatomi,
in
that
oklahoma,
having
applied
its
tax
laws
in
violation
of
settled
principles
announced
by
this
court
of
indian
sovereignty,
has
now
come
to
this
court
asking
that
those
principles
be
scrapped.
rather,
i
think
the
proper
solution
is
for
oklahoma
to
conform
its
tax
practices
to
those
principles.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
very
briefly
to
the
subject
of
hayden-cartwright,
recognizing
that
it
is
our
view
that
the
subject
was
not
raised
below
or
in
the
petition
and
therefore
should
not
be
reached,
but
should
the
court
reach
the
issue,
our
position
is
that
the
act
does
not
authorize
state
taxation
of
indian
tribes.
that,
we
submit,
is
clear
from
this
court's
decision
in
white
mountain
apache.
there,
the
court
held
that
the
act
does
not
authorize
taxation
of
fuel
use
by
a
non-indian
company
doing
business
for
a
tribe
on
its
reservation,
this
despite
the
fact
that
the
hayden-cartwright
act
explicitly
authorizes
taxation
of
fuel
use,
and
the
court
in
that
case
reserved
the
question
of
whether
the
act
even
applies
on
a
reservation.
our
submission
is
that
if
the
act
did
not
authorize
direct
taxation
of
a
non-indian
company
doing
business
for
a
tribe
on
its
reservation,
it's
awfully
difficult
to
see
how
the
act
could
then
be
said
to
authorize
direct
state
taxation.
moreover,
applying
the
unmistakably
clear
standard
from
yakima
and
blackfeet
and
bryan,
the
tribe...
neither
the
statute...
the
hayden-cartwright
act
doesn't
refer
anywhere
to
tribes
or
indians.
there's
no
indication
that
at
the
time
of
the
act,
1936,
indians
were
even
selling
fuel
on
their
reservations,
and
there's
no
evidence
that
congress
considered
the
distinct
barrier
to
taxation
posed
by
tribal
immunity.
what
the
act
does,
i
think,
instead
is
to
address
and
get
rid
of
a
distinct
separate
barrier
posed
by
the
territorial
barrier
posed
by
the
federal
status
of
certain
land,
for
example,
military
reservations.
on
the
subject
of
legal
incidence,
just
very
briefly,
we
believe
it's
principally
a
question
of
state
law.
there
are
sound
bases
for
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
in
particular,
as
my
cocounsel
has
noted,
it
appears
that
the
statute
requires
that
the
retailer
pay
the
taxes
to
the
distributor
for
remission
to
the
state,
and
it
protects
distributors
against
nonpaying
retailers,
but
has
no
corresponding
provisions
governing
the
retailer-to-consumer
step
in
the
transaction.
in
addition,
there's
a
useful
contrast
here
between
other
oklahoma
laws,
which
quite
explicitly
put
legal
incidence
on
the
consumer.
the
cigarette
tax
law
that
was
adverted
to
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
example,
and
the
special
fuels
tax
law
that
oklahoma
has
at
section
702
and
703
of
its
code
book,
and
it's
cited,
i
believe,
at
pages
6
to
7
in
a
general
way,
the
special
fuel
tax
section
of
my
cocounsel's
brief.
that
also
applies
explicitly
to
the
consumer.
i
think
some
sort
of
a
conclusion
can
be
drawn
based
on
the
absence
of
such
clear
focus
on
either
use
or
consumption
in
this
tax.
finally,
with
regard--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
do
not,
justice
ginsburg.
finally,
our
position
is
that
the
chickasaw
nation's
treaty
with
the
united
states
prohibits
the
states
from
taxing
wages
paid
by
the
chickasaw
nation
to
its
member
employees.
now,
it's
certainly
true,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
that
the
treaty
says
absolutely
nothing
about
income
taxes,
or
taxation
of
any
kind.
nevertheless,
i
think
one
has
to
read
the
treaty,
as
this
court
noted
in
choctaw
nation
involving
the
very
same
treaty,
from
the
vantage
point
of
the
indian
signatory
in
1830
in
the
case
of
the
choctaw,
1837
in
the
case
of
the
chickasaw,
those--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
think
the--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--if
i
may
respond
this
way,
i
think
from
the
vantage
point
of
the
indian
signatory
in
1830,
having
no
idea
that
some
day
this
territory
would
be...
this
land
would
some
day
become
part
of
a
state
known
as
oklahoma,
or
of
any
state,
having
no
conception
of
this
idea,
even,
of
state
income
taxation,
such
an
indian,
if
they
were
trying
to
express
the
thought
that
no
state
shall
ever
interfere
with
the
relationship
between
a
tribe
and
its
member,
if
they
were
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
put
that
in
a
treaty,
it's
hard
to
think
of
a
more
emphatic
way
than
the
language
which
the
treaty
uses,
which
is,
"no
territory
or
state
shall
ever
have
the
right
to
pass
laws
for
the
government
of
the
chickasaw
nation
or
their
descendents.
"
the
treaty
also
provides
that
where
any
well-founded
doubt
appears
regarding
treaty
terms,
it
should
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
tribe,
and
while
that's
a
tenet
of
statutory
construction
that
this
court
has
used
in
many
indian
treaty
cases,
this
is
a
rare
treaty
that
furthermore
includes
it
itself.
justice
ginsburg
inquired
as
to
the
limits
of
this
theory.
in
our
view,
the
limits
of
the
theory
involve
simply
laws
that
would
interpose
the
state
between
the
tribe
and
its
members,
in
this
case
by
actually
removing
part
of
the
wages
paid
by
a
tribe
to
its
members
and
thus,
a
property
tax,
for
example,
or
a
residency
tax
or
a
gasoline
tax
imposed
on
off-reservation
activity.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
well,
they're
not
long
gone
in
the
sense
that
they're
working,
in
this
case,
for
the
tribe,
and
they're
tribal
employees.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
for
the
tribe,
mr.
chief
justice?
if
it's
not
for
the
tribe--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--if
it's
not
for
the
tribe,
there's
no
tribal
relationship
with
the
members
that's
being
disturbed.
if
it
is--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--but
this
court--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--justice--
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
--i
think
if
we
were
talking
here
about
a
treaty
or
a
statute
that
had
been
enacted
not
having
to
do
with
the
indian
context,
i
would
probably
agree
with
you
that
government
probably
would
have
something
more
to
do
with
the
process
of
governance,
as
you
say.
but
i
think
from
the
vantage
point
of
the
indians
at
the
time,
i
think
the
understanding
would
be
that,
you
know,
at
least
insofar
as
the
tribe
is
dealing
with
its
members,
nobody
should
be
getting
in
between
there.
once
you
stray
off
the
reservation
and
you're
not
dealing
with
your
tribe,
criminal
laws
in
a
state,
for
example,
i
don't
think
that
historically
make...
that
the
logic
would
carry
through
as
much.
mr.
paul
a.
engelmayer
thank
you.
