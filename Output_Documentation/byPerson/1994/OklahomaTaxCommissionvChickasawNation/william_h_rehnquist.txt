chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-777...
771,
pardon
me,
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
v.
chickasaw
nation.
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
argument
raised
before
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
rothfeld?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
first
question
presented,
which
i
take
it
the
hayden-cartwright
act
would
have
to
come
under,
or...
it's
not
at
all.
it
says
whether
principles
of
preemption
or
indian
sovereignty
preclude
a
state
from
imposing
a
tax
on
sales
of
motor
fuel.
now,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
that
really
necessarily
includes
the
idea
that
there's
an
applicable
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
not
what
our
previous
cases
have
done,
is
it?
i
mean,
they
have
stuck
to
what
you
regard
as
a
formalistic
evaluation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're...
so
you
say
perhaps
the
tenth
circuit
was
wrong
here
in
deciding
the
question
of
oklahoma
law
as
to
where
the
incidence
of
the
tax
fell.
is
this
the
legislation
that's
dead
for
this
session
in
the
oklahoma
legislature,
to
change
the
incidence
of
the
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
quite
a
different
test
than
saying
we
ought
to
look
at
the
economic
impact,
which
i
thought
you
were
saying
a
moment
ago.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
chemehuevi,
which
was
maybe
10
years
ago...
i
just
glanced
at
it
again...
there
we
reversed
the
ninth
circuit
because
we
thought
it
had
been
wrong
in
deciding
where
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
was,
so
at
least
we
thought
at
that
time,
10
years
ago,
that
that
was
the
test.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
may
do
us
less
than
justice.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rothfeld.
mr.
arrow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
place
in
the
briefs
where
we
can
find
that
that
you're
quoting?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
the
incidence
of
the
tax
have
significance
outside
of
the
indian
law
context?
i
mean,
if
there's
a
failure
to
pay
a
concededly
owed
tax,
the
state
tax
commission,
it
may
depend
on
how
the
laws
are
drawn
whether
they
can
come
after
the
wholesaler
or
the
retailer
or
the
purchaser,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
arrow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
engelmayer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
engelmayer,
is
your
principle
that
if
congress
hasn't
abrogated
the
immunity,
the
state
can't?
is
that
consistent
with
our
decisions
in
moe
and
colville
and
chemehuevi?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
it
not
required
in
the
case
of
one
kind
of
legal
incidence,
if
your
theory
is
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then...
and
you
say
you
trace
that
back
to
a
congressional
determination
of
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
the
members
are
long
gone
from
the
reservation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
a
member
that
lives
off
the
reservation
and
works
off
the
reservation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
for
the
tribe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
engelmayer.
mr.
rothfeld,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
the
case
is
submitted.
