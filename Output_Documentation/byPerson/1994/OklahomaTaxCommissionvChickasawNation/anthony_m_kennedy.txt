it
we
reject
your
argument,
i
take
it
that
oklahoma
could
easily
revise
its
taxing
scheme
in
order
to
collect
these
taxes.
just
make
it
a
consumer-based
tax.
justice

so
the
cost
of
adhering
to
our
precedents
is
really
rather
slight.
the
state
can
simply
conform
to
the
rules
we've
set
forth
and
to
the
rules
that
all
of
the
other
states
have
been
following
in
evaluating
the
lawfulness
of
their
taxing
schemes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
surely
the
legislators
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
other
states
with
substantial
indian
reservations
are
well
aware
of
our
taxing
jurisprudence,
and
it
would
be
quite
astounding
for
us
to
presume
to
the
contrary.
