mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
two
oklahoma
taxes,
an
excise
tax
on
motor
fuel
and
the
state
income
tax,
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
could
not
be
applied
to
an
indian
tribe
or
to
certain
of
its
members.
now,
i'll
talk
about
those
taxes
in
turn,
starting
with
the
one
on
motor
fuel.
in
holding
the
tax
invalid,
the
court
of
appeals
applied
what
it
thought
to
be
a
per
se
rule
that
precludes
the
imposition
of
any
state
tax
whose
legal
incidence
falls
upon
an
indian
tribe
unless
that
tax
has
been
expressly
authorized
by
congress.
now,
because
the
court
found
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
falls
upon
the
retailer
of
the
fuel,
and
because
the
retailers
in
this
case
are
tribally
owned
convenience
stores
located
on
federal
trust
land
in
indian
country,
the
court
of
appeals
applied
its
per
se
rule
to
strike
down
the
tax.
we
think
there
are
three
things
wrong
with
this
decision.
first,
congress
has
expressly
authorized
this
tax.
second,
the
court
of
appeals,
even
apart
from
the
congressional
action,
should
not
have
applied
a
per
se
rule
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
and
third,
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
found
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
to
fall
upon
the
retailer
of
the
motor
fuel.
first,
congress
has,
by
statute,
expressly
authorized
the
very
tax
that
the
state
has
imposed
in
this
case.
the
hayden-cartwright
act
provides
in
so
many
words
that
states
may
impose
taxes
on
motor
fuel
sold
on
united
states
military
or
other
reservations.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
was
not,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
should
not
preclude
its
consideration
here.
this
is
not
a
new
claim
or
a
new
issue
that's
being
injected
into
the
case
at
this
point.
this
is
simply
additional
authority
for
what
has
been
the
tax
commission's
consistent
claim,
and
that
claim
is
that
the
tax
here
is
not
preempted.
i
think
to
consider
that
sort
of
preemption
claim
the
court
typically
in
indian
preemption
cases
looks
upon
the
entire
body
of
federal
legislation
and
certainly
the
hayden-cartwright
act
is
legislation
that
deals
specifically
with
the
question
of
whether
congress
intended
a
tax
of
this
kind
to
be
preempted.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
"reservation"
at
the
time
the
act
was
written.
this
court--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
this
court
had
said
some
years
before
in
united
states
v.
celestine
that
the
term
"reservation"
is
used
in
the
land
law
to
refer
to
any
body
of
land,
large
or
small,
that
has
been
reserved
from
sale
by
congress
for
any
purpose,
and
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
these--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
it
clearly
does
cover
indian
reservations.
your
honor.
as
i
say,
the
court
had
defined
the
term
"reservation"
to
include
specifically
indian
reservations.
as
to
whether
these
particular
lands
are
covered
by
that,
these
are
federal
trust
lands,
clearly
lands
that
have
been
reserved
from
sale
by
congress,
and
as
the
court
said
in
celestine,
the
general
use
of
the
term
is
to
refer
to
lands
that
have
been
reserved
for
any
purpose.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
true,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
true.
the
court
has
not
yet
expressed
an
opinion
on
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
again,
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
is
whether
or
not
this
oklahoma
law
is
preempted,
and
clearly
to
answer
that
question
requires
a
consideration
of
the
body
of
congressional
legislation.
i
guess
there
is
some
parallel
here
in
the
independent
insurance
agents
case
that
the
court
relied
upon
earlier
this
term
in
lebron,
and
the
issue
is
whether
the
statute
had
been
repealed,
and
that
point
was
not
argued
even
in
the
briefs
on
the
merits
or
at
oral
argument,
and
nevertheless
the
court
found
it
was
appropriate
to
look
to
whether--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that's
a
highfalutin
way
of
asking
whether
or
not
the
statute...
the
state
statute
is
preempted,
and
again
it's
difficult
to
resolve
a
question
of
preemption,
and
particularly
a
question
of
indian
preemption
which
the
court
has
looked
at
the
entire
body
of
federal
legislation
to
see
if
there
is
an
extant
federal
policy
that
bears
on
the
question
without
considering
whether
there
is
a
federal
statute
in
the
area,
and
this
federal
statute
clearly
expresses
the
intent
of
congress
as
to
the
particular
point
that's
at
issue
here,
so
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
again,
we
are
presenting
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
state
law
is
preempted,
and
to
answer
that
question
we
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
look
to
the
entire
body
of
federal
legislation
to
determine
whether
or
not
congress
has
expressed
a
policy
that
bears
on
the
particular
tax.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i...
certainly
that's
within
the
court's
discretion,
your
honor.
i
can't
disagree
with
that,
but
i
think
that
in
this
setting,
in
which
the
question
is
whether
federal
law
displaces
the
state
tax,
looking
to
the
body
of
federal
legislation
is
an
appropriate
way
of
resolving
that
point.
and
i
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
if
the
court
were
to
look
at
the
hayden-cartwright
act,
it
would
see
that
there
is
a
federal
policy
that
deals
specifically
with
the
question
in
this
case,
and
specifically
provides
that
gasoline
taxes
and
other
motor
fuel
taxes
may
be
collected
by
states
on
reservations,
and
again,
as
i
suggested
to
justice
scalia,
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
"reservation"
at
the
time
the
act
was
written.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
so
far
as
i
am
aware,
your
honor,
there
is
one
lower
court
decision
on
this
point
which
has
construed
it.
it's
a
decision
of
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
which
appears
in
273
northwest
reporter
involving...
it's
in
re
motor
fuel
liability--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
was
not
cited,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
the
legislation
that
the
tribe
refers
to
in
its
brief
is
essentially
dead
for
this
term
of
the
oklahoma
legislature,
so
there
is
no
prospect
that
the
case
be
mooted,
and
i
think
this
is
clearly...
even
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
this
was
not
a
ground
that
it
can
base
its
decision
upon,
this
is
not
a
ground
for
dismissing
the
case
as
improvidently
granted.
the
hayden-cartwright
act
was
specifically
noted
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
said
that
it
was
not
going
to
reach
it,
so
the
court
was
certainly
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
act
at
the
time
the
petition
was
presented,
and
i
should,
i
suppose,
move
on
to
the
question,
perhaps
the
more
fundamental
question,
entirely
apart
from
the
act,
of
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
that
there
is
a
per
se
rule
that
precludes
state
taxation
of
the
kind
of
this
case.
we
think
that
that
clearly
was
wrong,
and
explaining
why
that's
so,
it's
useful
to
start
with
three
points
that
are
not
disputed
between
the
parties
in
this
case.
i
think,
first,
that
both
the
united
states
and
the
tribe
recognize
that
the
balance
of
state
and
tribal
interests,
which
ordinarily
is
of
crucial
importance
in
resolving
the
question
of
whether
a
state
may
assert
its
jurisdiction
on
the
reservation,
they
acknowledge
that
that
balance
decisively
favors
the
state
in
this
case.
they
also
acknowledge
that
their
rule
rests
upon
a...
economically
meaningless
legal
formulas,
and
the
formulas
are
of
legal
incidence
that
has
no
connection
to
the
economic
realities
in
this
case,
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
there
is--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
that
was
the
court
of
appeals
conclusion,
your
honor.
we
disagree
with
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
but
we
think
that
the
question
of
where
the
legal
incidence
falls
has
no
economic
bearing,
no
bearing
as
a
matter
of
economic
reality.
i
think
that
the
tribe
acknowledges--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
it
would
be
the
commission's
preference
to
win
both
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
i
can
confidently
state
that
it's
the
commission's
preference
to
win
both
of
those
cases,
and
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--and
i
think
that
they
are
entirely
consistent.
as
i
understand
the
court's
position
in
jefferson
lines,
it
focused
on
an
actual
difference
between
a
sales
tax
and
a
gross
receipts
tax.
i
mean,
the
court
pointed
out
that
a
sales
tax
can
be
collected
only
in
one
state,
and
there,
therefore,
is
no
possibility
of--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
that
is
certainly
true,
but
there
was
a
real
difference,
a
real
world
difference
between
the
two
types
of
taxes
that
were
at
issue
in
that
case.
there
is
no
real
world
difference
between
the
tax
that
oklahoma
is
applying
here
as
interpreted
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
tax--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
that's
quite
right,
and
that
is
a--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no.
i'm
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
what
the
court
should
do
is
determine
these
cases
without
reference
to
the
formality
at
all,
to
the
legal
formulas,
and
simply
look
to
the
effect
of
the
state
law
on
the
tribe.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
that
is
absolutely
right,
and
we
therefore
think
that
in
determining
whether
a
tax
of
this
kind
is
valid,
the
court
should
look
to
whether
or
not
it
has
an
impermissible
effect
on
the
tribe.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that
it's
clear
from
the
body
of
the
court's
cases
that
it
has
not
regarded
legal
instances
as
the
be-all
and
end-all
of
the
inquiry
that
is
necessarily
decisive.
in
the
sac
and
fox
and
the
colville
cases,
for
example,
the
state
imposed
taxes,
automobile
and
excise
taxes
and
registration
fees,
on
members
of
the
reservation
living
on
the
reservation
when
there
was
the
tribe
living
on
the
reservation
who
garaged
their
cars
on
the
reservation,
and
the
court
said
that
those
taxes
might
well
be
valid
if
they
were
apportioned
to
deal
with
use
of
the
car
outside
of
indian
country.
the
court
didn't
say
that
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
falling
upon
the
member
of
the
tribe
was
dispositive
in
those
cases.
in
the
moe
case,
the
court
also
said
that
its
decision
striking
down
state
taxes
did
not
deal
with
the
issue
in
which
the
receipts
that
are
subject
to
tax
are
attributable
to
nonreservation
sales
to
nonmembers,
and
the
court,
i
think
generally,
as
in
the
sac
and
fox
case,
has
referred
to
the
rule
in
state
imposition
of
taxes
on
indians
as
a
presumption.
such
a
presumption
presumably
may
be
overcome,
so
i
don't
think
it's
the
case
that
legal
incidence
is
necessarily
decisive.
what
the
court
has
done
is
on
a
number
of
occasions
strike
down
state
taxes
that
fell
on
what
the
court
has
described
as
value
generated
on
the
reservation
by
the
tribe.
those
are
taxes
like
the
tax
on
the
income
of
a
tribal
member
reservation
resident,
at
issue
in
mcclanahan,
cases
like
the
tax
on
the
sale
by
the
tribe
on
the
reservation
to
members
of
the
tribe
of
goods
that
were
used
on
the
reservation
that
were
at
issue
in
moe
and
colville.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
true.
we
think
that
it
is
clear
that
oklahoma,
under
moe
and
colville
and
chemehuevi
and
the
other
cases
of
the
court
acknowledging
the
state's
power
to
impose
such
a
tax,
the
state
could
modify
the
tax
legislation
here.
the
court...
the
tribe
acknowledges
in
its
brief
that
all
the
state
need
do
is
insert
somewhere
in
the
text
of
the
tax
statute
the
legislative
intent
that
the
burden
of
the
tax
be
borne
by
the
consumer,
that
that's
sufficient
to
validate
the
tax.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
let
me
respond
in
two
parts
to
that,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
first
of
all
the
court
would
not
be
adhering
to
its
precedent.
there
certainly
is
no...
i
mean,
in
the
sense
that
the
court
does
not
have
to
depart
from
any
of
its
decisions
to
rule
for
the
state
here.
there
is
no
case
in
which
the
court
has
struck
down
a
tax
that
otherwise
would
be
valid,
as
this
one
clearly
would
be,
simply
because
the
legal
incidence
was
said
to
fall
upon
the
wrong
person.
but
there
are
substantial
costs
that
are
associated
with
a
tax...
with
a
rule
that
judges
the
validity
of
a
tax
based
upon
this
kind
of
formalism.
it
serves
principally
this
rule,
as
what
the
court
described
in
complete
auto
as
a
trap
for
the
unwary
legislative
draftsman
who
is
not
likely
to
be
focusing
on
this
program,
certainly
can't
anticipate
that
years
down
the
road
a
tribe
is
going
to
become
a
retailer
or
a
wholesaler
of
fuel.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that
this
case
actually
is
an
illustration
of
the
problem,
that
the
oklahoma
legislature
i
think
had
been
laboring
under
the
assumption
that
the
legal
incidence
of
this
tax
fell
upon
the
consumer.
the
state
has
consistently
taken
the
position
throughout
this
litigation
that
it
does
not
fall
upon
the
retailer,
and
one
problem
with
this
kind
of
formalistic
rule
is
that
it
will
prompt
people
to
search
for
statutory
ambiguities
to
devise
tax
exemptions
for
themselves.
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
legislation
that
is
dead
would
have
declared
the
intent
of
the
oklahoma
legislature
that
the
tax
fall
upon
the
consumer.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
no,
we
don't
suggest
that
it's
a
question
of
federal
law.
certainly
in
the
first
instance
it's
a
matter
of
state
law,
although
if
the
rule
is,
and
we
say
it
should
not
be,
but
if
the
rule
is
that
the
legal
incidence
determines
the
availability
of
an
immunity
from
state
taxation
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
if
there
is
a
federal
rule
of
preemption
that
turns
upon
the
existence
of
legal
incidence,
then
clearly
the
federal
courts
are...
must
be
able
to
determine
where
that
incidence
falls.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
would
otherwise
be
impossible
to
resolve--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
that's
right.
we
don't
suggest
that
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
where
the
legal
incidence
lies
as
a
matter...
as
to
the
intent
of
the
oklahoma
legislature,
and
the
court
has
said
that
the
intent
of
the
legislature
is
determinative
in
determining
where
the
legal
incidence
of
a
tax
falls.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
clearly
wrong,
and
the
court
has
in
other
cases,
as
in
chemehuevi,
a
very
similar
situation,
has
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
got
it
wrong
and
has
determined
the
legal
incidence
for
itself.
i
mean,
i
think
that
that...
the
chief
justice
referred
to
the
cases
of
the
court
accepting
legal
incidence
as
dispositive.
i
think
that
what
the
cases
of
the
court
have
done
have
found
legal
incidence
as
an
easy
way
of
disposing
of
the
case,
and
as
in
chemehuevi,
where
the
court
of
appeals
got
it
wrong,
the
court
of
appeals
has
stepped
in,
and
we
think
that
it
is
clear
here
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
get
it
wrong.
as
we
read
the
tax
statute,
there
are
two
provisions
that
bear
specifically
on
the
question
of
whether
the
consumer
or
the
retailer
bears
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax.
we
think
both
of
those
indicate
that
it
clearly
is
the
consumer
who
bears
the
legal
incidence,
and
i
think
that
if
the
court
chooses
to
move
in
that
direction
and
not
reach
the
more
fundamental
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
such
a
per
se
rule,
they
can
easily
dispose
of
the
case
by
finding
that
the
legal
incidence
does
fall
upon
the
consumer.
those
two
provisions
i
should
know
quickly.
one
of
them
is
a
definitional
provision
of
the
statute
which
refers
to
collection
of
taxes
by
both
retailers
and
distributors,
making
clear
that
both
of
them
were
intended
by
the
legislature
to
collect
the
tax
from
someone
further
down
the
distribution
chain.
that
is
confirmed
by
another
provision
of
the
statute,
an
exemption
provision,
which
provides
that
purchasers...
that's
the
ultimate
consumers...
who
buy
gasoline
for
agricultural
uses
are
relieved
of
the
obligation
of
paying
the
tax,
again
indicating
that
it
is
ordinarily
the
purchaser
who
is
intended
to
pay
the
tax.
so
i
think
that
is
an
easy
ground
on
which
the
court
can
dispose
of
this
case,
but
i
should
return
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
absolutely
right,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
that
is
the
most
powerful
argument
for
why
such
a
formalistic
rule
makes
no
sense.
the
court
has
said
that
legal
incidence
falls
upon
the
consumer
where
the
legislator
intends
for
the
tax
to
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer.
that
is
so
even
though
the
tax
doesn't...
even
though
the
state
law
doesn't
expressly
require
the
pass-through.
that
was
the
holding
in
chemehuevi,
and
that
is
true
even
when
there
is
no
sanction
imposed
upon
the
retailer
who
fails
to
pass
the
tax
on.
that
was
the
holding
in
the
mississippi
tax
commission
case
and
first
agricultural
bank
cases.
so
all
that
the
legislature
need
do
to
change
the
legislative
incidence
of
this
tax
is
declare
somewhere
in
the
text
of
the
statute
its
intent
that
the
burden
of
the
tax
be
borne
by
the
ultimate
consumer,
and
as
justice
scalia
noted
before,
that
makes
no
difference
in
reality.
it
does
not
affect
the
tax
collection
procedure
at
all.
it
does
not
collect
the
obligation
upon
the
retailer
in
this
case.
to
have
the
validity
of
the
state
tax
law
turn
upon
that
sort
of
formalism
i
think
makes
no
sense.
the
court
has
rejected
that
approach
in
complete
auto
and
in
various
other
settings,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
that
kind
of
dinosaur
of
a
rule,
having
become
extinct
everywhere
else,
should
continue
lumbering
along
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
the
court
should
look
to
the
same
considerations
that
it
looks
to
outside
of
the
tax
context,
where
it
looks
to
what
the
court
has
called
the
particularized
inquiry
into
the
state,
the
tribal,
and
the
federal
interest.
if
the
tax
is
one
that
imposes
an
impermissible
burden
on
the
tribe
by
somehow
threatening
to
infringe
on
tribal
sovereignty,
or
the
mechanisms
of
tribal
government,
as
in
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
invalidated
state
taxes,
the
tax
should
be
invalid,
so
for
example--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
it
doesn't
matter
who
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on.
i
think
it
matters
what
the
effect
of
the
tax
is
upon
the
tribe,
upon
the
mechanisms
of
tribal
government.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
but
the
court
has
already
held
in
moe
and
colville
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
true,
justice
breyer,
but
the
court
has
confronted
that
balance
repeatedly
in
cases
in
which
the
legal
incidence
fell
upon
the
ultimate
purchaser
and
has
found
that
the
tribal
interests
in
those
circumstances
do
not
outweigh
the
state's
interest,
and
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
is.
we
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
on
the
contrary,
i
think
that
we
do
win
on
the
reality,
because
the
court...
the
court
has
judged
taxes
in
which
the
legal
incidence
falls
upon
the
purchaser,
the
taxes
in
moe
and
in
chemehuevi,
and
in
colville,
and
in,
most
recently
in
milhelm
attea.
the
court
has
viewed
those
in
terms
of
the
economic
reality.
the
court
has
said--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
think
the
rule
the
court
has
stated
is
that
a
state
law
is
not
invalid
simply
because
it
has
an
adverse
economic
impact
on
the
tribe.
the
court
has
said
there
must
be
a
particularized
inquiry
into
the
state
tribal
interests,
and
the
state
has
conducted
that
inquiry,
and
although
what
you
say
is
true
as
a
matter
of
economic
reality,
the
court
said
quite
clearly
in
colville
that
there
is
no
right
on
the
part
of
the
tribe
to
collect...
to
make
sales
that
it
would
not
otherwise
have
made
simply
because
it
is
marketing
a
tax--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
no--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--but
i
think
the
test
is
not
as
the
court
has
said
it.
the
test
is
not
who
is
hurt
by
the
tax
or
whose
pocket
the
tax
comes
out
of.
the
test
is
whether
the
state
law
infringes
upon
the
mechanisms
of
tribal
government,
undermines
the
mechanisms
of
tribal
government
in
a
fundamental
way.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
maybe
i
have
misspoken.
i
don't
suggest
that
the
tax
falls
upon
whoever
bears
the
economic
impact.
i'm
saying
that
in
judging
the
constitutionality,
the
validity
of
a
state
tax
law
as
it
bears
on
indian
tribes,
the
court
must
look
to
the
effect
of
that
tax
on
the
tribal
interests
that
the
court
has
said
are
significant.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
again,
i
think
that
the
court
has
found
it
an
easy
and
noncontroversial
way
to
dispose
of
these
cases
on
the
ground
that
the
legal
incidence
doesn't
fall--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
don't
presume
to
tell
the
court
what
it
was
thinking
when
it
resolved
these
cases,
your
honor,
but
as
i
said,
it
is
i
think
clear
from
the
tenor
of
the
court's
opinion
as
in
sac
and
fox
and
colville,
where
it
did
not
dispose
of
challenges
on
the
ground
that
these
taxes
have
a
legal
incidence
that
falls
upon
members
of
the
tribe,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
the
court
said,
in
fact,
those
taxes
might
well
be
permissible
if
they
were
properly
apportioned,
even
though
the
legal
incidence
fell
upon
the
member
of
the
tribe
on
the
reservation,
and
i
think
that
what
the
court
has
looked
to
throughout
this
body
of
cases
is
whether
or
not
the
total...
the
tax,
as
applied,
has
an
impermissible
effect
on
the
mechanisms
of
tribal
government.
in
the
cases
in
which
the
legal
incidence
was
found
to
fall
upon
someone
other
than
the
tribe,
the
court
has
looked
to
whether
or
not
tribal
operations
would
be
displaced,
whether
or
not
it
was
real
tribal
interest
that
was
at
stake,
and
that
is
clearly
not
the
case
here
where
all
the
tribe
is
doing
is
importing
onto
the
reservation
goods
manufactured
elsewhere
that
are
going
to
be
marketed
for
resale
largely
to
non-indians
for
use
outside
of
indian
country.
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
the
court
has
no
questions.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
a
couple
of
points.
let
me
start
with
the
motor
fuel
tax
and
questions
that
were
raised
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
stevens,
whether
or
not
the
legal
incidence
actually
makes
any
difference
in
the
real
world.
i
think
the
answer
quite
clearly
is
no.
the
only
entity
that
has
a
legal
obligation
to
do
something
here,
and
against
whom
the
state
has
any
rights,
is
the
distributor,
who
neither
of
us
suggests
bears
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax,
so
the
question
then
is
whether
or
not
the
state's
failure
to
insert
these
magic
words
of
legal
incidence
somewhere
in
the
text
of
the
tax
statutes,
words
that
would
have
no
actual
effect,
should
render
the
tax
invalid.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
of
the
state--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that
the
state
was
of
the
view
that
it
should
get
this
issue
resolved,
that
it
should
not
be
bound
by
a
semantic
rule
to
resolve
its
law
around
something
which
is
meaningless,
and
i
think
the
court--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
if
the
tax
commission
is
correct
in
its
contention
here
that
that
rule
should
not
have
legal
effect,
the
legal
incidence
rule,
then
there
is
no
need
for
the
state
to
modify
its
rule
in
accordance
with
this.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
they
may
have
been
concerned
that
it
would
moot
the
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
can't
speak
for
all
the
motivations
of
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
past
tax
obligations
are
precluded...
a
suit
to
collect
those
precluded
by
the
tribe's
sovereign
immunity,
which
is
one
problem
with
this
type
of
rule.
in
fact--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
they
may
well
have
been
concerned--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--they
may
well
have
been
concerned
that
it
would
moot
the
case.
i
don't
think
they
were
concerned
that
it
would
reflect
some
weakness
in
the
case.
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
they
thought
there
was
unnecessary--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i'm
sorry,
i
may
not
be
following
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
it
will
always
be
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
will
always
be
the
case
that
where
there's
an
argument
about
the
meaning
of
legal
incidence
that
it's
possible
to
avoid
it
by
changing
the
state
law.
i
mean,
that
has
not
been
the
court's
reaction
in
the
past.
in
a
case
like
complete
auto,
the
state
could
have
changes
its
law
to
delete
the
reference
to
privilege
of
doing
business
in
interstate
commerce,
which
the
court's
prior
decisions
it
heard,
it
felt
held
determinative,
and
the
court
said
it
wasn't
necessary
for
the
state
to
modify
its
law
around
the
formalism.
the
proper
course
was
to
get
rid
of
the
formalism
so
that
it
wasn't
determinative
in
the
future,
and
clearly,
as
i
was
saying
before,
there
is
no
real
world
impact
of
determining
the
legal
incidence
falls
on
one
party
or
the
other,
and
therefore
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
law
should
be
held
invalid
because
the
magic
words
were
not
used.
the
court
has
rejected
that
rule
in
the
past
in
virtually
every
other
context.
there
is
no
reason
to
have
it
here
unless
precedent--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
probably
not,
and
the
reason
is
because
the
court
has
said,
looking
to
the
economic
reality,
that
the
state
can't
tax
value
generated
on
the
reservation
by
a
tribal
enterprise,
and
that
explains
the
outcome,
i
think,
in
cases
like
colville
and
moe,
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
state
could
not
tax
sales
by
the
tribe
to
tribal
members
of
goods
for
use
on
the
reservation.
that
was
an
entirely
intertribal
operation,
and
allowing
the
state
to
assert
its
interest
there,
where
it
really
has
no
concern,
no
regulatory
concern
at
all,
and
no
responsibilities,
would
really
threaten
to
displace
the
mechanisms
of
tribal
government.
that
principle
does
not
apply
here,
because
the
customers
are
in
large
part
nonmembers
who
are
taking
the
goods
subject
to
tax
off
the
reservation
immediately.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
the
lines
the
court
has
drawn
in
cases
like
hebezon
is
whether
or
not
there
is
value
generated
on
the
reservation
by
the
tribe.
