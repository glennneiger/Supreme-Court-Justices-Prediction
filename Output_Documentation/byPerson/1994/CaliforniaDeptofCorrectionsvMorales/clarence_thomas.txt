justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
in
an
essence
it
involves
twice
convicted
murder
who
says
that
after
i
was
convicted
you
had
changed
the
parole
hearing
rules
and
that
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
respondent
was
convicted
of
murdering
his
wife
in
1980
while
on
parole
for
previous
murder.
he
became
eligible
for
parole
in
1990.
as
required
by
california
law
the
board
of
prison
terms
held
a
hearing
in
1990.
at
that
time
the
board
found
respondent
unsuitable
for
parole
although
the
california
law
in
effect
when
respondent
was
convicted
provided
for
annual
hearings,
parole
hearings.
in
1981
amendment
to
that
law
allowed
the
board
to
differ
respondent’s
subsequent
hearings
for
up
to
three
years.
in
this
case
the
board
differed
the
hearing
of
respondent.
after
it
found
that
the,
it
was
not
reasonable
to
expect
the
parole
would
be
granted
and
another
hearing
during
the
intervening
years.
the
board
scheduled
respondent’s
next
hearing
for
1992.
respondent
then
filed
this
habeas
petition.
he
argued
that
as
apply
to
him,
the
1981
amendment
constituted
and
ex
post
facto
law.
the
district
court
denied
the
petition
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
the
amendment
effectively
increase
respondent’s
sentence.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reverse.
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
aimed
at
laws
that
retroactively
alter
the
definition
of
crimes
or
increase
punishments.
the
1981
amendment
has
or
had
no
effect
on
the
punishment
attach
to
respondent’s
crime.
it
left
untouched
respondent’s
indeterminate
sentence
as
well
as
the
substantive
formula
for
securing
any
reductions
to
that
sentence.
the
amendment
simply
altered
the
methods
for
fixing
a
parole
release
date
under
identical
substantive
standards.
respondent
contains
that
there
is
some
conceivable
risk
that
the
amendment
will
effect
the
actual
term
of
his
confinement.
we
conclude
however
that
respondent’s
speculation
is
insufficient
to
establish
an
ex
post
facto
violation.
the
amendment
creates
only
the
most
attenuated
possibility
of
increasing
the
measure
of
punishment
for
the
effected
crimes,
this
showing
his
insufficient
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
