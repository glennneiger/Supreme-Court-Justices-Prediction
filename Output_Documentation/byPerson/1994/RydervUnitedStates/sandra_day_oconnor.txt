i'd
like
to
ask
you
how,
under
these
circumstances,
the
petitioner
was
harmed.
the
subsequent
appointment
by
the
secretary
of
transportation
put
the
very
same
people
back
on
the
court
who
made
the
decision,
and
it's
hard
to
construct
any
kind
of
harm
to
the
petitioner
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
have
a
very
different
situation,
for
example,
if
it's
an
article
iii
court,
and
a
non-article
iii
judge
is
participating.
i
can
imagine
some
sort
of
harm.
here,
with
an
article
i
situation,
where
the
very
same
people
are
reappointed,
it's
very
hard
to
understand
what
the
harm
might
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
at
common
law,
an
appointment-related
challenge
of
the
kind
you're
trying
to
make
here
as
defense
to
a
prosecution
would
not
have
been
considered
justiciable,
would
it?
it
would
have
been
limited
to
the
bringing
of
quo
warranto,
or
something
of
that
kind,
never
allowed
as
a
defense
to
a
prosecution.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
may
be,
in
fact,
what's
behind
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine
as
such,
the
notion
that
when
raised
as
the
petitioner
did
here,
it
just
isn't
going
to
produce
an
overturning
of
the
conviction.
