justice
antonin
scalia
were
facts
challenged
at
the
intermediate
stage?
in
other
words,
did
the
intermediate
court
have
any
fact-finding
to
do
which
would
not
have
been
reconsidered
by
the
court
of
military
appeals?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
what
justice
ginsburg
says
would
seem
to
be
correct,
that
if
there
are
only
issues
of
law,
you've
simply
skipped
the
middle
stage.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
put
it
in
a
context
of
article
iii
courts.
if
someone
had,
let's
say,
lost
in
the
district
court,
and
raised
issues
of
law
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
then
he
applied
here
for
certiorari
and
we
also
affirmed,
surely
it
would
make
no
difference
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
properly
constituted
or
not,
because
he
got
a
full
review
of
the
same
things
that
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
by
us,
so
how
could
it
possibly
affect
his
status?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lotz,
i
want
to
go
back
to
whether
there's
any
harm
done
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
later
review
anyway
which
would
have
been
the
same
review.
what
if
the...
what
if
a
court
of
military
review
had
found
for
the
defendant
in
the
case?
what
would
have
happened?
does
the
united
states
always
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can't
really
tell.
it
might
have
come
out
differently
with
a
different
panel.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
united
states
might
not
have
appealed.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
might
also
have...
or
might
they.
was
there
any
factual...
i
think
you
said
before
there
was
no
factual
issue
even
before
them,
was
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
still
and
all,
at
least
there's
a
chance
they
would
have
come
out
for
the
defendant
and
the
united
states
would
not
have
appealed.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lotz,
before
you
waste
more
ammunition
on
prospectivity,
why
do
we
have
to
worry
about
prospectivity?
this
prospective
decision
did
not
come
from
an
article
iii
tribunal
anyway,
and
we
don't
have
any
case
law
that
says
that
non-article
iii
tribunals
can't
even
achieve
selective
prospectivity
if
they
want
to.
is
there
any
restriction
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
say
it
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
we
be
tied
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
it...
it
might
be
ironic,
but
i
don't
know
why
it
would
pose
any
problem
from
the
standpoint
of
prospectivity
juris.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
that
this,
even
as
applied
to
article
iii
courts
this
allows
selective
prospectivity?
that
is
to
say,
in
a
particular
case
we
think
selectively
we
should...
this
renders
harper
wrong,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
you
get
that
out
of
that
language.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
if
the
language
means
what
you
say
it
means,
it
validates
selective
prospectivity
as
well
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--one
would
have
to
make
that
argument.
it's
the
only
argument
the
language
allows.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
least
properly
appointed
judges.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
appointments
clause
does
not
assure
quality.
i
mean,
it
is
neither...
it
is
neither
not
complied
with
when
a
person
of
no
quality
is
appointed,
nor
is
it
complied
with
when
a
person
of
quality
is
appointed--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
then
i
don't
see
what
the
relevance
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
other
judges
might
have
come
out
other
ways.
justice
antonin
scalia
judges
sometimes
come
out
different
ways--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
on
the
same
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you
cannot
assure
us
that
this
would
have
come
out
the
same
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
--it
seems
to--
--can
we
ignore
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine,
then,
in
our
consideration--
--that's
what
i--
--of
this
case?
because
frankly,
you
know,
i
used
it...
as
you
know,
i
was
in
the
justice
department
for
several
years,
and
used
it
often,
but
i
never
recall
its
being
used
except
collaterally,
as
to
something
that's
already
happened
and
someone
challenges
it
after
it's
happened,
not
in
the
case
where
someone
is
before...
immediately
before
an
officer
whom
he
claims
xx
improperly
appointed.
he
says,
you
have
no
right
to
xx
in
my
case.
has
the
government
ever
asserted
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine
in
that
case,
in
that
kind
of
situation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
it
is
raised
immediately
before
the
officer,
before
he
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
we've
asserted
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
before
we...
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
real
risk
for
this
court
in
adopting
this
kind
of
an
approach
that
you're
urging
on
us,
that
we
look
upon
the
individual
case,
and
before
we
apply
the
doctrine
that
the
officer
who
rules
on
a
case
has
to
be
one
properly
appointed,
at
least
where
the
challenge
is
raised
immediately.
the
problem
with
your
approach
is
that
in
some
situations
it
would
lead
us
into
confrontations
with
the
executive,
where
the
executive
appoints
someone
who
is
a
close
friend,
let's
say,
or
one
of
the
reasons
for
which
you
have
an
appointments
clause,
that
there
is
indeed
some
problem,
but
you
cannot
say
the
individual
appointed
was
incompetent.
all
you
can
say
is
that
the
individual
was,
perhaps,
one
more
favorable
to
the
appointing
officer
than
the
appointments
clause
would
have
provided.
in
order
to
protect
the
person
in
a
case
like
that,
we
would
have
to
make
an
affirmative
finding
that
this
person
was
an
unsatisfactory
individual,
that
he
had
judged
the
case
improperly,
was
not
as
good
as
another
judge.
i
don't
want
to
have
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
could
remand
to
have
them
apply
the
six-factor
test,
i--
