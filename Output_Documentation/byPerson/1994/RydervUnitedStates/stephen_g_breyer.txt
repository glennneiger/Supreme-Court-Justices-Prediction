stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry,
i'm
just
missing
something.
i
may
have
just
missed
this,
but
in
the...
i'm
just
reading
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief,
and
in
the
appendix
they
said
in
the
united
states
coast
guard
court
of
military
review...
that's
the
one
that
was
not
properly
constituted,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
was
an
assignment
of
error
that
the
appellant
received
a
disproportionate
sentence
because
the
military
judge
unduly
emphasized
the
deterrent
function
of
sentencing,
and
then
i
didn't
find
the...
i
didn't
find
that
referred
to.
i
may
have
just
missed
it
in
the
u.s.
court
of
military
appeals.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
an
issue
that
they
decided
below
in
the
improperly
constituted
court
that
the
properly
constituted
court
didn't
decide.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
we
probably
would
have
to
reach
the
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
difficulty
that
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
is
in...
i
haven't
read
the
whole
carpenter
opinion,
but
in
the
part
of
it
in
your
brief,
the
reason
that
they
give
for
not
extending
it
backwards,
it
says
just
as
the
acts
of
the
fec
commissioners
were
accorded
de
facto
validity
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
we
hold
that
judicial
acts
of
the
chief
judge
are
entitled
to
de
facto
validity.
now,
if
that's
the
reason
that
they
gave,
then
how
can
we
know
whether
they
would
have
given
some
other
reason
if
they'd
adopted
your
theory
that
you're
arguing
now?
