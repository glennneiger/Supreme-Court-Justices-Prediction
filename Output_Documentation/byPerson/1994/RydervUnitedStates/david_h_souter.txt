justice
david
h.
souter
--which
we
would
have
to
do
if
we
went
the
other
way
from
yours
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
effect
you're...
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
there
is
remedial
discretion
to
give
no
remedy
whatsoever,
and
therefore
i
don't
see
how
you
draw
the
distinction
between
prospectivity
of
remedy
and
prospectivity
of
vindication
of
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
one
way
to
do
that,
for
example,
would
be
to
recognize
a
harmless
error
doctrine
as
we
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
a
very
far
step
from
that
to
say
that
to
sort
of
deny
the
old
slogan
and
say
yes,
irdeed,
there
can
be
rights
absolutely
without
remedy,
and
that
seems
to
me
the
consequence
of
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
one
of
the
consequences
of
accepting
that
argument
is
that
no
one,
i
suppose,
no
party
in
interest,
will
ever
have
an
incentive
to
challenge
a
valid
appointment
in
these
circumstances.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
it
say
that,
on
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
they
were
good
enough
the
first
time,
why
aren't
they
good
enough
the
second
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
once
again,
the
consequence
of
taking
that
as
relevant
is
in
effect
to
say
that
as
long
as
the
improperly
appointed
people
are
competent,
there's
nothing
to
worry
about.
there's
no
other
value
to
be
concerned
with.
as
long
as
they
get
it
right,
who
cares?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the...
in
effect
you're
saying
there
just
is
not
an
independent
value
in
policing
the
appointments
clause
by
providing
the
normal
incentive
for
a
party
like
this
to
raise
the
issue
prospectively,
and
you're
saying
that,
and
implicitly
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying
there
just
is
not
a
value
that
outweighs
the
importance
of
getting
a
particular
issue
right
on
the
merits.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
long
as
they
get
it
right,
who
cares?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
would
suppose
he
has
even
the
disincentive
on
your
theory,
because
if
he
raises
it,
as
i
suppose
he
ought
to
do,
at
the
trial
level,
he
has
to
worry
about
making
all
those
judges
mad,
and
i
suppose
that
if
he
knows
that
he
gets
nothing
independently
by
raising
the
appointments
clause
issue,
there
is
in
fact
an
incentive
not
to
raise
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
see
why
your
argument
doesn't
cut
against
you
on
that,
because
it
seems
to
me
what
you've
shown
us
is
that
this
would
be
a
defect
which
it
would
be
very
easy
to
remedy.
there
are
only
these
two
judges,
and
according
to
your
brother
there
are
only
ten
cases.
as
he
said,
no
sky
is
going
to
fall
to
correct
this
defect.
