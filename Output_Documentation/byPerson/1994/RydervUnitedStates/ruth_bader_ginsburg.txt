mr.
lotz,
if
we're
concerned
with
practicality,
then
isn't
this
business
about
de
facto
at
the
middle
tier
kind
of
an
academic
exercise?
after
all,
you
have
no
complaint
about
the
court
of
first
instance,
and
then
there
was
a
review
at
the
third
tier,
a
fully
competent
court,
and
the
conviction
was
affirmed,
so
even
if
there's
an
infirmity
at
the
second
tier,
why
should
it
matter?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
can
you
tie
it
into
this
case
and
tell
me
what
it
was
that
was
reviewed
as
the
second
tier
that
was
not
reviewed
on
final
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
conceivable
that
the
issues
were
the
same,
and
if
they
were,
then
this
is
kind
of
a
moot
case,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
freitag
it
was
in
the
first
instance
there
was
an
infirmity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
glidden
it
was
a
question
of
an
article
iii
judge
at
the
second
tier.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
think
of
a
case,
let's
say
cases
in
the
circuit,
and
a
question
is
certified,
so
it
comes
right
here.
we
have
no
middle
tier.
or,
in
the
old
days,
when
we
had
three-judge
courts
more
often
than
we
do
now...
take
a
voting
rights
case
nowadays,
three-judge
court,
go
right
to
the
supreme
court...
the
middle
tier
seems
to
be
an
unnecessary
extra
in
this
picture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
two
reviews,
no
less
than
one,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
remedy
would
be
going
back
perhaps
to
the
same
panel,
or
what
would
you
remedy
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
these
very
same
judges
who
are
now
constitutionally
appointed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
it
be
unlawful
for
the...
after
all,
they
are
already
familiar
with
this,
and
it
would
be
least
expensive
to
have
the
same
judges
review
what
they
did
now
that
they
have
the
proper
appointment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
when
this
court
reverses
an
appellate
panel
and
it
has
to
go
back
to
that
same
panel,
and
maybe
there
was
an
alternate
ground
to
end
up
for
the
same
party?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
clarify
the
issue
that
was
raised
before
this
tribunal
that
you
say
was
improperly
composed
and
therefore
has
to
be
redone,
precisely
what
that
issue
was,
and
whether
it
would
be
appropriate
then
to
say
only
as
to
the
unreviewed
issue
does
this
have
to
go
back
to
have
what
would
be
a
first
appeal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
would
it
be
appropriate
to
have
just
that
issue--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--since
the
other
issues
were
reviewed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
a
remediless
one--
--yes.
--so
why...
mr.
wallace,
your
distinction
between
choice
of
law
and
remedy
has
a
familiar
ring.
we
heard
it
in
a
case
called
reynoldsville
casket
not
too
long
ago.
are
you
familiar
with
that
case?
i
know
that
the
government
wasn't
a
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
identical
argument
was
made...
well,
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
service
of
process
question
there,
that
was
a
question
of
choice
of
law,
and
choice
of
law,
that
was
fully
retroactive,
but
remedy,
applying
it
to
this
plaintiff,
you
didn't
have
to
do
that,
because
that
was
a
question
of
remedy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
that
be
easier
than
have
to
face
habeas
later
on?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
what
do
you
think
of
the
argument
about
the
issues
that
were
reviewed
by
the
court
of
final
instance?
i'd
like
your
frank
answer
to
the
question
that
i
raised.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
they
have
to
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--since
this
is
a
unique
situation,
would
they
have
to
be?
why
couldn't
the
review
simply
be
on
the
written
record,
with
no
oral
argument?
just
have
three
judges
who
hold
proper
appointments.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
at
least
with
respect
to
buckley
v.
valeo,
wasn't
that
just
a
challenge
head-on
to
the
statute
with
no
individual's
case
on
the
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
didn't
have
somebody
in
the
position
of
ryder.
