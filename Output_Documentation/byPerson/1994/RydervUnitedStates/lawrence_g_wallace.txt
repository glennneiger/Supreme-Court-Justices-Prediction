mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
1993
decision
in
harper
v.
the
virginia
department
of
taxation
recognized
a
distinction
between
retroactive
application
of
a
legal
rule
as
a
choice
of
law
matter
and
remedial
issues,
a
distinction
previously
discussed
in
opinions
in
the
american
trucking
and
jim
beam
cases
that
were
not
subscribed
to
by
a
majority
of
the
court.
in
those
cases,
the
distinction
was
important
because
they
involved
invalid
schemes
of
state
taxation,
and
the
remedial
issues
implicated
questions
of
state
law.
here,
the
distinction
is
important
because
the
remedial
issues
implicate
questions
of
remedial
discretion
of
a
federal
appellate
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there...
in
particular
circumstances
there
can
be
occasions
when
a
remedy
is
not
appropriate.
i
mean,
the
breadth
of
the
remedial
discretion
of
federal
appellate
courts
is
actually
something
codified
and
recognized
in
a
familiar
provision
of
title
28
of
the
code,
which
was
not
cited
heretofore
in
the
case,
but
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
of
it,
and
i
notified
counsel
of
it
yesterday
when
in
preparation
for
this
argument
its
relevance
became
apparent,
and
because
it's
not
quoted
in
the
papers
i'll
just
read
it
briefly
to
the
court,
title
21...
section
2106
of
title
28,
and
it's
the
ending
that
seems
to
us
in
context
to
have
particular
relevance.
it
says:
"the
supreme
court
or
any
other
court
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
"
--and
that,
presumably
the
court
of
military
appeals
is
any
other
court
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
but
it
codifies
a
principle
whether
that's
true
or
not...
"may
affirm,
modify,
vacate,
set
aside,
or
reverse
any
judgment,
decree
or
order
of
a
court
lawfully
brought
before
it
for
review,
and
may
remand
the
cause
and
direct
the
entry
of
such
appropriate
judgment,
decree,
or
order,
or
require
such
further
proceedings
to
be
had
as
may
be
just
under
the
circumstances.
"
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
rather
clear
implication
is
when
there
are
reasons
to
conclude
in
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case
that
further
proceedings
would
not
be
just
under
the
circumstances,
further
proceedings
need
not
as
a
remedial
matter
be
ordered
in
that
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
understand
that.
i'm
looking
to
this
provision
as
a
codification
of
remedial
principles
that
are
inherent
in
the
exercise
of
appellate
authority
in
any
event,
and
as
a
guide,
rather
than
as
something
that
necessarily
has
to
apply
to
the
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
not
say
it
renders
harper
wrong
at
all.
i
would
say
that
the
circumstances
to
be
looked
to
are
not
necessarily
selective
circumstances,
but
the
circumstances
that
would
warrant
pure
prospectivity
such
as
the
court
has
ordered
in
some
of
its
cases,
including
northern
pipeline
v.
marathon
and
buckley
v.
valeo.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
one
could
make
that
argument.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
what
is
just
under
the
circumstances
can
be
looked
at
in
a
more
generalized
way
than
the
selective
prospectivity
way
of
looking
at
it.
the
circumstances
are
not
self-defining,
that
they
necessarily
mean
selective.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
may
be
rights
without
remedy
in
a
particular
circumstance,
although
there
would
be
remedies
in
other
circumstances,
and
what
i
would
like
to
suggest
here
is
that
there
were
six
factors,
six
considerations
that
were
before
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
that
apply
to
all
nine
or
ten
of
the
pending
cases...
this
is
not
a
selective
matter...
that
warranted
their
conclusion
that
when
there
was
no
other
defect
in
the
proceedings
there
was
no
need
to
order
relief
in
this
case,
and
i
would
like--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
is
in
our
view,
justice
souter,
not
the
consequence,
because
anyone
who
raises
an
additional
issue,
as
the
petitioner
here
did,
would
have
the
incentive
to
also
raise
the
appointments
clause
issue,
because
if
there
were
another
error
or
defect
in
the
proceedings
that
required
retrial
or
remand
to
the
court
of
military
review,
certainly
then
the
court
of
military
appeals
should
say
any
further
hearing
should
be
conducted
by
a
tribunal
constituted
in
a--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--because--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--because
there
now
has
been
a
definitive
ruling
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
that
this
defect
had
occurred.
that
happened
to
be
a
question
of
first
impression
in
the
carpenter--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
weren't
a
party.
i
have
some
familiarity
with
it.
it's
a
case
pending--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that's
a
case
in
which
the
government
is
not
taking
a
position
which
is
pending
before
the
court.
i
did
not
hear
the
argument,
and
i'm
reluctant
to
comment
about
the
case
itself.
i
do
think
that
we
should
look
at
the
particular
circumstances
with
which
the
court
of
military
appeals
was
faced
when
it
determined
under
buckley
v.
valeo
to
accord
the
judicial
acts
of
these
two
judges
with
de
facto
validity
for
purposes
of
the
cases
that
were
then
before
it,
and
there
are
six
considerations
that
we
think
justified
that
in
the
situation
that
they
were
presented
with,
and
it's
a
rather
narrow
situation
that
they
were
presented
with.
if
i
can
just
recount
what
these...
the
first
is
that
they
had
already,
by
the
time
they
rendered
the
decision,
there
was
already
a
cure
that
had
been
effectuated.
there
can
be
debate
about
the
validity
of
that
cure,
but
the
secretary
of
transportation
had
reappointed
the
same
two
judges.
the
second--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it
was
an
effort
to
correct
the
defect
that
had
been
found,
and
to
that
extent
the
public
interest
consideration
required--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it's
a
cure
for
the
future.
the
question
is
one
of
statutory
authority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
but
there's
a
very
substantial
argument
that
these
statutes
should
be
interpreted
in
conformity
with
the
appointments
clause
rather
than
in
a
manner
that
would
not
enable
the
responsible
officials
to
comply
with
the
appointments
clause
while
still
conducting
the
proceedings
that
congress
has
authorized.
i
think
our
argument
is
quite
strong
on
that.
in
any
event,
to
that
extent
the
public
interest
had
been
addressed.
now,
there...
i've
already
mentioned
the
second
factor,
that
there
was
no
other
error
or
defect.
they
found
no
error
in
the
trial
that
occurred
in
the
case,
for
example,
or
any
error
in
the
appellate
proceedings
to
the
extent
they
had
been
reviewed
and
they
decided
certain
contentions
were
not
worthy
of
their
review.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we'd
reverse
for
that
reason,
and
any
further
proceedings
would
be...
they
could
order
it
would
have
to
be
before
a
tribunal
constituted
in
accordance
with
the
appointments
clause.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
but...
but
the
competence
is
quite
important
when
you're
talking
about
whether
in
the
absence
of
other
defect
there's
reason
to
upset
the
result
of
the
particular
proceeding
and
redo
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
light--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
light
of
the
adequate
incentive
to
raise
the
issue
along
with
other
issues
which
the
defendant
will
have
if
for
no
other
reason
than
because
if
he
persuades
an
appellate
court
that
there
was
more
than
one
error,
the
appellate
court
is
less
likely
to
say
that
it's
satisfied
that
the
cumulative
effect
of
the
errors
was
harmless.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
we
generally
have
to
operate
on
the
assumption
that
judges
will
rise
above
personal
reactions
to
contentions
and
rule
on
their
legal
merits.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
well,
this
gets
me
to
another
one
of
the
considerations
that
is
relevant.
what
the
court
of
military
appeals
was
faced
with
here
was
a
situation
involving
only
two
individual
judges
in
the
entire
military
court
system.
military
trial
judges
all
have
to
be
active
duty
commissioned
officers.
it's
only...
and
they
don't
need
a
second
appointment
from
the
president
under
this
court's
decision
in
weiss.
it's
only
on
the
courts
of
military
review
that
civilians
can
be
appointed,
and
it's
only
these
two
judges
on
the
coast
guard
court
of
military
review
who
were
appointed
as--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--with
respect,
justice
stevens,
i
have
not
yet
made
my
point.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
which
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
these
two
individuals
happened
both
to
be
persons
who
had
served
while
on
active
duty
as
commissioned
officers
as
judges
of
courts
of
military
review,
so
while
the
analogy
is
not
a
perfect
one,
they
are
in
many
respects
and
important
respects
similar
to
judges
on
senior
status.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
are
not
contesting
whether
the
appointments
clause
was
violated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we're
talking
about
an
exercise
of
remedial
discretion
in
the
circumstances.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
defect
has
been
remedied
for
future
cases,
in
our
view,
and
we
do
think
that
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
resist
collateral
attack
on
habeas
corpus
efforts
which
may
be
made.
there
will
be
more
than
ten
cases
litigated,
mr.
justice,
even
though
we
think
that
it
could
be
cured
by
rehearing
ten
cases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we'll
be
facing
the
habeas
anyway,
unless
we
prevail
in
this
case,
and
then
the
habeas
cases
would
follow
a
fortiori
from
it.
my
point
in
comparing
these
two
judges
to
judges
on
senior
status
is
that
there
is
no
reason
to
question
their
qualifications
that
they
could
fully
and
fairly
hear
such
cases.
they've
heard
many
such
cases
sitting
pursuant
to
valid
appointments
prior
to
this
particular
problem.
and
when
you
combine
that
with
the
fact
that
ordinarily
when
a
case
is
remanded
to
a
court
it's
remanded
to
the
same
panel,
and
these
judges
have
now
been
reappointed...
two
of
the
three
judges
on
the
panel
were
these
same
judges.
no
other
error
was
committed
by
them...
to
send
it
back
to
the
same
panel
would
be
a
rather
useless
gesture
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
were
issues
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
denied
review
of.
my
point
is
that
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
judges
who
heard
and
passed
on
those
issues
were
not
fully
qualified
to
do
so.
they
had
been
doing
so
in
the
past
pursuant
to
appointments
that
were
proper
under
the
appointments
clause.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--of
course,
but
there's
a
question
here,
if
you
don't
follow
the
normal
practice
of
remanding
it
to
the
same
panel,
if
you
specify
that
there
have
to
be
different
judges,
which
can
occur
here
because
the
military
judges
have
been
rotated,
although
the
same
two
civilian
judges
out
of
the
five
judges
still
sit
there,
you're
really
giving
this
particular
criminal
defendant
something
that
most
of
the
defendants
don't
have,
which
is
two
reviews,
and
these
reviews
are
more
extensive
reviews
in
the
military
system
factually
than
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--ordinary
court
of
appeal
reviews.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
whatever
it
is,
it's
something
that
other
defendants
don't
get,
two
de
novo
reevaluations
of
the
evidence.
whether
there's
briefing
and
argument
or
not,
we're
still
dealing
with
the
record
from
a
court
martial.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
sits
in
panels
of
three,
which
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--five.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
would,
because
the
military
judge
who
was
on
this
case
has
been
rotated
out
of
this
service,
and
there
are
three
new
military
judges
on
the
court,
and
they...
active
duty
judges,
that
is,
and
they
could
hear
the
case.
it
would
be
possible.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
can...
the
panels
rotate,
and
it
can
be
the
three
military
judges.
in
the
navy,
marine,
or
the
army
or
air
force
court
of
military
reviews
there
are
no
civilian
judges,
so
you
always
have
panels
consisting
entirely
of
active
duty
officers.
that
would--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
don't
really
know.
i
guess
that
is
the
answer,
i'm
told
from
a
nod
of
the
head,
but
i
do
know
that
their
practice
would
ordinarily
be
to
go
back
to
the
same
panel,
and
in
order
for
the
court
of
military
appeals
to
order
anything
other
than
that
the
same
judges
reconsider
the
same
matters
without
suggesting
any
error
occurred--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
think
that
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine
is
the
backdrop
here
against
which
this
was
a
proper
exercise
of
remedial
discretion.
that
doctrine
has
been
recognized
over
and
over.
strictly
speaking,
we
don't
think
that
that
was
precisely
what
was
applied
in
the
de
facto
officer
cases.
the
courts
never
reached
the
merits
of
whether
there
had
been
a
defect
in
the
appointment.
here,
the
reasoning
was,
as
it
was
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
that
there
had
been
a
defect
in
the
appointment
but
that
nonetheless
the
official
acts
that
have
been
taken
should
be
accorded
de
facto
validity,
which
is
more
a
question
of
remedial
discretion
than--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
can't
say
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
can't
say
whether
we've
ever
asserted
it.
we're
not--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
don't
know
of
a
case
where
we
have,
and
we're
using
it
only
as
a
backdrop
to
the
exercise,
what
we
believe
is
the
proper
exercise
of
remedial
discretion
in
this
case
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
there
has
to
be
a
substantial
basis
for
believing
that
the
cure
was
valid.
i
don't
think
that
that
question
need
be
resolved
in
advance
before
it's
been
litigated
in
the
lower
courts
or
briefed
and
argued
in
this
court
on
the
basis
of
that,
and
i
think
we
certainly
have
a
substantial
basis
for
arguing
that
the
cure
was
effective.
let--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
don't
say
that
this
case
should
turn
on
an
assessment
by
this
court
of
that
kind
of
question.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
court
of
military
appeals,
when
it
resolved
a
question
of
first
impression
that
was
before
that
court,
namely,
that
the
principle
of
weiss
that
a
second
commission
was
not
needed
cannot
be
extended
to
retired
military
officers,
that
the
question
is
whether
the
circumstances
that
they
were
dealing
with
justified
their
remedial
decision
that
these
particular
cases
need
not
be
reheard
because
of
the
circumstances
in
which
they
had
been
heard.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
it
is
properly
looked
at
as
an
exercise
of
remedial
discretion
in
that
use
of
the
buckley
case.
in
1984,
in
a
case
that
petitioner
cites
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
an
opinion
that
was
joined
by
then
judge
ginsburg,
called
andrade
v.
lauer,
the
court
of
appeals
there
described
buckley
the
following
way:
the
court's
discussion
of
remedies
in
buckley
did
advert
to
the
need
on
prudential
grounds
to
avoid
interfering
with
past
actions
of
the
commission.
the
court's
discussion,
however,
gives
no
indication
that
this
was
a
matter
of
anything
other
than
ordinary
remedial
discretion
in
a
case
involving
reform
of
an
entire
institution.
the
prospectivity
that
the
court
adopted
in
buckley
for
its
relief,
as
it
did
in
cipriano
v.
city
of
houma
and
in
northern
pipeline
v.
marathon,
was
basically
a
remedial
question
rather
similar
in
kind
to
other
aspects
of
the
court's
jurisprudence,
where
it
has
held
that
remedies
are
not
rigid
and
mechanical,
but
are
adaptable
to
the
circumstances
presented.
that's
true
in
harmless
error
jurisprudence
in
the
criminal
area.
it's
true
with
respect
to
the
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
which
otherwise
applies--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it
arose
in
that
context,
that
is
correct,
although
there
had
been
actions
taken
of
an
administrative
nature
that
were
not
being
undone.
i
mean--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct,
but
even
in
injunction
jurisprudence
the
court
has
said
it's
error
to
interfere
with
action
in
the
future,
that
it
doesn't
comply
with
the
statute
until
the
statute
has
been
complied
with
in
cases
like
weinberg
v.
romero
barcello.
