justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i--
--mr.
lotz--
--go
ahead.
go
ahead.
i
was
just
going
to
ask
you,
what
is
your
view
as
to
the
validity
of
the
appointment
made
in
1993
in
january?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
is
it
not
correct
that
it
was
made...
was
that
appointment
made
before
the
judgment
in
this
case
became
final
in
the
sense
that
all
direct
review
was
over?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
your
view,
i
gather,
then,
that
even
if
the
valid
appointment
were
made
20
minutes
after
the
case
was
over
it
would
be
too
late?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
you
would
argue,
though,
that
as
is
true
with
us,
that
the
court
of
last
resort
is
sometimes
affected
by
the
caliber
of
the
judging
in
the
intermediate
court.
it
always
has
an
impact.
i
know
it
does
for
me
when
we
review
cases.
i
think
a
lot
about
what
the
intermediate
court
said,
even
if
i
end
up
agreeing
with
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this:
when
you're
getting
into
this
distinction
between
direct
review
and
collateral
attack,
this,
i
understand,
is
on
direct
review,
but
is
it
your
position
that
your
client,
if
he
had
not
raised
it
during
the
proceeding
but
had
waited
until
after
the
appellate
process
had
run
its
course
and
then
brought
a
habeas
corpus
petition,
that
relief
would
have
been
appropriate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
i
think
teague
would
no
longer
be
a
problem
if
we
decided,
and
perhaps
we'd...
it
may
be
in
the
first
case,
but
somewhere
along
the
line
i
would
assume
that
the
question
could
be
raised.
if
it
were
not
teague-barred
you
would
think...
i
understand
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far,
but
do
you
think
there
might
be
a
distinction
between
the
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
could
have
cases,
it
seems
to
me...
you
say
the
government
was
on
notice,
and
in
a
perfect
world
we
all
know
what
the
law
is,
but
there
are,
potentially
at
least,
some
very
close
questions
under
the
appointments
clause
in
which
the
government
might
reasonably
think
that
there
had
been
a
proper
appointment
but
later
on,
after
years
go
by,
somebody
realizes
there
was
a
flaw
in
the
procedure,
and
in
the
meantime
hundreds
of
cases
have
been
decided.
can't
there...
there
is
a
legitimate
reliance
interest
at
some
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
if
you
rely
on
that,
you're
really
asking
us
to
decide
whether
that
was
a
valid
cure
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
we
were...
we
thought
it
was
a
perfectly
obvious
ineffective
effort
to
correct
it,
would
it
still
be
satisfactory
to
you?
i'm
not
saying
that's
the
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
rather
strange
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
they
tried
to
cure
it
if
they
didn't,
in
fact,
do
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say--
--it's
arguably
a
cure
for
the
future.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
again,
that
seems
to
me
if
there
were
another
error
you'd
reverse
for
that
reason.
you
wouldn't
worry
about
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
argument
sounds
to
me
like
you'd
say
you
got
tried
before
a
judge
who
happened
not
to
be
a
lawyer,
not
to
be
appointed
or
anything
else.
we
have
100
other
federal
judges
who
are
great
judges,
but
the
one
you
got
tried
before
just
didn't
happen
to
be
one
of
those,
and
we'll
rely
on
the
other
100.
i
think
the
one
that
tries
the
litigant's
case
is
the
important
one
to
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
interested--
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
true
of
the
coast
guard?
i
thought
they
always
worked
it
out
so
they
had
at
least
one
civilian
judge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
can
i
ask
you
sort
of
a
broader
question?
your
argument
has
been
entirely
sort
of
an
appeal
to
discretion.
you've
got
six
factors.
you've
only...
i
only
know
what
three
of
them
are.
i
know
you're
going
to
give
us
three
more
when
you
get
through,
and
that
you
rely
on
section
2106.
you're
not
relying
at
all
on
anything,
any
legal
doctrine,
a
de
facto
doctrine
that
would
apply
regardless
of
these
particular
equities
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it's
critical
to
your
position,
then,
that
the
subsequent
attempt
to
cure
the
defect
was
valid.
it
seems
to
me
your
position
would
be
totally
unpersuasive
if
there
was
just
a
mere
attempt
later
on
to
cure
it,
and
nobody
seems
to
want
to
argue
whether
the
later
appointment
did,
in
fact,
cure
it.
