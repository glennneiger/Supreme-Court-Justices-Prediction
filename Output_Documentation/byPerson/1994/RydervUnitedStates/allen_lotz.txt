mr.
allen
lotz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner,
james
d.
ryder,
was
convicted
at
a
general
court
martial
of
several
offenses
pursuant
to
article
66
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
his
case
was
then
automatically
appealed
to
the
coast
guard
court
of
military
review.
his
case
was
heard
there
by
three-judge
panel
consisting
of
two
civilian
military
appellate
judges
and
one
active
duty
commissioned
officer.
during
the
course
of
that
appeal,
he
raised
as
a
contention
that
the
judges
of
that
court
had
not
been
appointed
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
appointments
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
court
of
military
review
rejected
that
contention.
the
case
was
then
reviewed
further
on
discretionary
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals,
and
the
appointments
issue
was
raised
again
by
that
court.
the
court
of
military
appeals
rejected
that
contention
on
the
grounds,
or
on
the
basis
of
its
recent
decision
in
the
carpenter
case.
in
carpenter,
the
court
of
military
appeals
found
that
the
civilian
judges
of
the
coast
guard
court
of
military
review
had
been
improperly
or
unconstitutionally
appointed,
but
affirmed
their
decision
there
anyway,
saying
only
that
just
as
the
acts
of
the
federal
election
commissioners
were
accorded
de
facto
validity
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
we
hold
that
the
judicial
acts
of
the
civilian
judges
are
entitled
to
de
facto
validity.
the
case
is
now
here
to
address
the
question
of
what
the
effect
of
the
unconstitutional
appointments
of
these
military
appellate
judges
is
on
the
decision
in
the
case.
everyone
is
in
agreement,
the
government
has
conceded,
that
the
civilian
judges
of
the
coast
guard
court
were
unconstitutionally
appointed,
yet
the
government
then
goes
on
to
say
nevertheless
there
should
be
no
relief
in
this
case
under
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine.
mr.
allen
lotz
your
honor,
our
view
is
that
that
appointment
is
not
valid,
but
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case
because
the
decision
at
issue
here
was
made
before
the
secretary's
memorandum.
mr.
allen
lotz
well,
justice
stevens,
direct
review
continues,
but
it
was
made
before
the
case
was
decided
by
the
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
allen
lotz
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
my
view.
mr.
allen
lotz
justice
o'connor,
the...
this
court's
cases
in
separation
of
powers
cases
have
never
indicated
that
a
showing
of
direct
harm
is
necessary.
if
you
look
at
buckley,
northern
pipeline,
morrison
v.
olson,
freitag--
mr.
allen
lotz
--the
freitag
decision,
also
while
this
court
found
the
appointments
there
to
be
proper,
there
was
a...
as
it
was
put
there,
the
decisions
of
the
special
trial
judges
of
the
tax
court
would
have
been
invalid
had
they
not
been
properly
appointed.
that
was
also
an
article
i
court.
the...
this
court's
decision
in
mistretta
defined
the...
or
referred
to
the
separation
of
powers
as
necessary
to
the
preservation
of
liberty.
a
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers
is
really
an
invitation
to
mischief,
to
prejudice
arising,
and
furthermore,
while
this
appeal
to
the
court
of
military
review
was
automatic,
it
was
by
no
means
a
pro
forma
appeal.
there
were
significant
issues
raised
dealing
with
the
fairness
of
the
underlying
court
martial.
mr.
allen
lotz
currently,
under
the
very
old
common
law,
which
viewed
the
holding
of
an
office
as
akin
to
a
property
right,
that's
correct.
that
has
not
been
the
view
recently
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
the
decision
of
the
d.c.
circuit
court
in
the
federal
election
commission
v.
nra
political
victory
fund--
mr.
allen
lotz
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
the
question
we're
deciding
here,
whether
it
will,
and
we're
not
talking
about
an
overturning
of
the
conviction,
basically
an
overturning
of
the
appeal
where
the
unconstitutionally
appointed
judges
sat.
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine
is
really
a
rule
of
practicality
designed
to
avoid
chaos
and
mass
disruption
when
a
defect
in
an
appointment
is
discovered
long
after
the
fact.
mr.
allen
lotz
well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
review
at
the
court
of
military
appeals
by
no
means
corrected
this.
the
court
of
military
appeals
is
limited
to
reviewing
matters
of
law.
the
court
of
military
review,
on
the
other
hand,
has
much
broader
powers
to
review--
mr.
allen
lotz
--the...
i
can't
tell
you
specifically
anything
that
was
not
reviewed.
the--
mr.
allen
lotz
--well,
we
don't...
our
position
is
that
it's
not
moot.
the
court
of
military
review,
by
statute,
may
only
affirm
those
findings
that
it
finds
correct
in
law
and
fact.
the
court
of
military
appeals
takes
the
facts
as
they're
found.
the
petitioner
also...
the
case
is
not
moot.
he
has
a
punitive
discharge
that's
not
been
executed.
mr.
allen
lotz
there
was
no
fact-finding
that
was
critical
to
the
decisions
of
the
issues.
mr.
allen
lotz
well,
your
honor,
the
statute
provides
the
petitioner
with
the
right
to
an
appeal
at
the
court
of
military
review.
the
constitution
requires
that
that
appeal
be
heard
by
judges
appointed
in
a
manner
designed
to
enhance
their
quality
and
their
statute,
and
that
wasn't
done
here,
and--
mr.
allen
lotz
--justice
scalia,
the...
my
understanding
of
the
decisions
in
glidden
and
in
freitag
indicate
that
it's...
you
don't
have
to
show
direct
harm.
mr.
allen
lotz
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
lotz
glidden
involved
two
cases.
one
was
at
the
trial
level,
one
was
at
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
allen
lotz
well,
justice
ginsburg,
congress
didn't
think
it
was
an
unnecessary
extra
and
provided
for
it.
the
court
of
military
review
traditionally
is
the
petitioners
or
the
appellant's
best
hope
for
relief.
in
addition,
review
of
the
court--
mr.
allen
lotz
--that's
correct,
but
it's
a
statutory
right.
but
furthermore,
the
court
of
military
appeals
is
not
an
appeal
as
of
right.
that's
done
on
petition
only.
mr.
allen
lotz
we
did.
mr.
allen
lotz
it
was.
mr.
allen
lotz
normally
they
grant
on
specific
issues.
occasionally,
the
court
will
specify.
mr.
allen
lotz
they
reviewed
the
issues
specified
by
the
petitioner,
which
in
essence
were
the
same
issues
reviewed
by
the
court--
mr.
allen
lotz
--after
denial
of
appropriate
review
in
the
court
of
military
review.
mr.
allen
lotz
i
would
absolutely
agree
with
that,
justice
stevens.
mr.
allen
lotz
remedy
would
be
a
review
anew
in
the
court
of
military
review
by
constitutionally
appointed
judges.
mr.
allen
lotz
my
position
is
that
they
should
not
review
the
same
case
again
as
they
have
already
given
an
opinion
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
allen
lotz
it's
our
opinion
that
that
would
be
unlawful,
yes.
mr.
allen
lotz
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the...
in
essence,
at
the
earlier
appeal
they
were
not
constitutionally
appointed
judges,
and
in
that
capacity
they
issued
a
decision
expressing
their
opinion
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
i'm
sure
this
court
understands
that
that's
normally
inappropriate
to
then
sit
as
a
judge
on
that
same
case.
mr.
allen
lotz
on
a
prejudgment
of
the
merits
of
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
lotz
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
but
a
moot
court
is
by
definition
an
academic
exercise,
not
a
real
dispute
between
live
parties,
so
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
situation.
mr.
allen
lotz
i
believe
that
there...
that
may
be
different
in
that
the...
i'm
assuming
that
the
appellate
panel
that's
reversed
was
consti...
or
composed
entirely
of
constitutionally
appointed
judges,
and
their
opinion
then
is
expressed
only
in
their
judicial
capacity.
mr.
allen
lotz
the
united
states
does
not
always
appeal.
the...
and
of
course
it
depends
on
the
grounds.
mr.
allen
lotz
it
might
have.
mr.
allen
lotz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
lotz
it
was
basically
a
legal
issue
regarding
evidentiary
issues.
mr.
allen
lotz
that's
correct.
there
could
have
been
a
new
trial.
mr.
allen
lotz
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
lotz
i
appreciate
your
asking
that,
justice
breyer.
the...
that
issue
was
raised
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
review
was
not
granted
on
that
issue,
but
that
also
is
the
kind
of
issue
that
the
court
of
military
review
has
more
leeway
on
approving
only
that
portion
of
the
sentence
that
they--
mr.
allen
lotz
--that's
correct.
mr.
allen
lotz
that's
correct,
and
i
apologize
for
that
misstatement.
the
government
is
arguing
here
that
this
application
of
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine
here
is
akin
to
pure
prospectivity
which
it
claims
has
never
been
expressly
renounced
by
this
court,
but
whatever
its
application
in
a
civil
case
seeking
injunctive
relief
like
buckley,
it's
fairly
clear
from
a
reading
of
justice
souter's
plurality
opinion
in
beam
that
that
implies
or
assumes
that
you
can't
have
juris
prospectivity
in
a
criminal
case.
griffith
makes
it
clear
that
there's
no
selective
prospectivity
in
a
criminal
case.
beam
and
harper,
there's
no
selective
prospectivity
in
civil
cases.
mr.
allen
lotz
justice
stevens,
i'm...
that's
not
my
client.
i
don't
represent
anyone
who's
here
on
habeas
corpus.
i
think
a
habeas
corpus
petitioner
with
the
same
grounds
would
have
an
uphill
struggle
based
on
teague
v.
lane,
the
limits
on
relief
in
habeas
cases.
mr.
allen
lotz
i
think
that
there
may
well
be
a
distinction
between
a
case
on
direct
review
and
collateral
review.
mr.
allen
lotz
well,
justice
scalia,
my
reading
of
griffith
and
beam
and
harper,
all
of
those
went
back
to
state
courts,
which
by
definition
are
not
article
iii
courts,
plus,
it
would
be
ironic
to
say
that
it's
okay
for
the
court
of
military
appeals
to
issue
a
purely
prospective
decision
that
this
court
could
not
do
even
when
that
case
comes
up
here.
mr.
allen
lotz
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
lotz
the--
mr.
allen
lotz
--the--
mr.
allen
lotz
--in
this
case,
if
petty
officer
ryder
had
not
persuaded
the
court
of
military
appeals
that
the
appointments
of
the
court
of
military
review
judges
were
unconstitutional,
basically
that
he
lost
on
the
legal
issue
at
the
court
of
military
appeals
but
won
on
that
issue
at
this
court...
this
is
an
article
iii
court
that
should
not
issue
purely
prospective
decisions.
it
would
be
ironic
if
he
could
lose
below
and
do
better
here
than
he
does
by
winning
below.
mr.
allen
lotz
well,
and
as
i
said
earlier,
griffith
and
beam
and
harper
all
dealt
with
state
courts,
and
forbidding
them
from
applying
prospective
adjudication.
the--
mr.
allen
lotz
--the
issue
that
was
not
granted
review
at
the
court
of
military
appeals
dealt
with
a
contention
that
the
panel,
which
is
the
equivalent
of
the
jury,
imposed
an
unduly
severe
sentence
because
of
the
way
the
military
judge,
the
military
trial
judge
answered
a
question
and
that
he
may
have
overemphasized
the
general
deterrent
effect
of
a
harsh
sentence
and
led,
then...
which
led
the
panel
to
impose
that
unduly
harsh
sentence.
the
court
of
military
review,
their
statutory
authority
indicates
that
they
should
approve
only
that
part
of
the
approved
sentence
that
they
find
correct
in
law
and
fact.
they
have
statutory
authority
simply
to
say,
we
find
this
sentence
too
severe,
and
reduce
it.
mr.
allen
lotz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
lotz
i--
mr.
allen
lotz
--i
don't
believe
it
would.
it
would
still
permit
the
review
in
the
first
instance
of
all
the
issues
by
unconstitutionally
appointed
judges,
and
the
appointments
clause
requires
the
proper
appointments.
this
whole
prospectivity
issue
is
contrary
to
the
nature
of
the
judicial
process.
by
necessity,
it
looks
backwards
and
tries
to
resolve
disputes
between
real
litigants.
the
value
in
purely
prospective
decisionmaking
when
it's
been
applied
in
civil
cases
has
really
been
to
protect
the
settled
expectations,
particularly
large
economic
interests
that
have
been
arranged
based
on
an
erroneous
but
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
the
law
is.
you
really
don't
have
those
considerations
in
this
case.
there's
not
a
large
reliance
interest.
petty
officer
ryder
certainly
didn't
rely
on
the
validity
of
these
appointments.
he
challenged
the
appointments
when
he
was
before
that
court.
mr.
allen
lotz
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
government
was
on
notice
of
the
allegation
of
this
appointments
defect.
it
was
raised
in
the
briefs.
the
government
took
no
steps
to
correct
it
before
the
decision.
the
government
created
the
flawed
process
in
the
first
place
by--
mr.
allen
lotz
--when
there
is
reasonable
reliance
that
may
be
a
factor,
but
that's
only
really
been
applied
in
civil
cases
anyway.
this
is
a
criminal
case.
the
government
created
the
problem
in
the
first
place,
was
on
notice
of
it,
and
could
have
corrected
it
in
a
couple
of
fashions
and
did
not
do
that.
mr.
allen
lotz
there
is
in
some
cases,
your
honor.
the...
this
is
not
that
close
case,
is
our
contention,
plus
reliance
interests
normally
speak
in
terms
of
many,
many
people.
there
are
only,
by
my
count,
ten
appellants
situated
similarly
to
petty
officer
ryder.
we're
not
talking
about
the
republic
collapsing
under
the
weight
of
many,
many
reappeals.
this
case
has
often,
and
it's
the
nature
of
judicial
review
in
itself,
that
if
a
decision
below
is
reversed,
it
causes
a
certain
amount
of
disruption.
that's
simply
the
nature
of
the
process.
another
problem
with
applying
a
purely
prospective
decision
here
is
it
reduces
the
incentive
to
litigate
an
issue
like
this.
if
an
appellant
sees
that
he's
likely
to
get
a
decision
in
his
favor
on
the
law
but
no
relief,
there's
really
no
incentive
to
litigate
it,
and
it
would
permit
these
sorts
of
problems
to
continue
uncorrected.
if
there
aren't
any
other
questions,
i'd
just
like
to
conclude
by
asking
that
the
court
remand
the
case
for
a
new
appeal
by
a
properly
appointed
court
of
military
review
judges
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
allen
lotz
just
very
briefly,
at
the
risk
of
repeating
what
justice
breyer
and
justice
ginsburg
said,
this
six-factor
analysis
that
mr.
wallace
referred
to
is
not
apparent
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
decision
in
carpenter.
they
took
one
sentence,
took
one
case,
buckley,
which
was
a
case
seeking
only
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
with
respect
to
the
argument
about--
mr.
allen
lotz
--well,
that...
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
would
generate
much
more
litigation
than
sending
ryder
back
to
the
court
of
military
review,
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
specifically
considered
and
rejected
the
government's
contention
in
carpenter
that
the
fact
that
these
individuals
were
retired
military
officers
somehow
improved
their
position
under
the
appointments
clause.
thank
you.
