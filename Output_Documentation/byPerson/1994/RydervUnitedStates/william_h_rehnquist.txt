chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
94-431,
james
ryder
v.
united
states.
mr.
lotz.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
lotz,
did
you
petition
for
review
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
it
granted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what...
do
they
grant
on
specific
issues,
or
do
they
review
the
same
things
that
you
argued
to
the
intermediate
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
did
they
do
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
really
did
get
a
review
by
a
correctly
constituted
court
of
the
same
issues
that
you
raised
in
the
first
tier
appellate
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
it
be
unlawful?
there's
no
charge
of
bias
or
anything
like
that.
it
was
just
a
defect
in
their
appointment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
certainly
don't
understand
that.
on
what
are
you
basing
your
contention?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
three,
say,
professors
sat
on
a
moot
court
and
the
question
was
presented
to
them
and
they
decided
it
for
the
moot
court
and
then
later
the
exact...
they
were
all
appointed
to
a
court
of
appeals,
and
later
the
exact
same
question
comes
up
in
the
court
of
appeals,
are
they
disqualified
because
they
participated
in
the
same
thing
in
a
moot
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
petitioned
the
court
of
military
appeals
to
review
that
and
they
declined
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
how
about
the
prosecuting
arm
of
the
coast
guard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
that
generally
true
in
a
lot
of
cases
where
you're
talking
about
reliance
interest?
you
simply
rely
on
the
existing
state
of
the
law,
and
you
may
have
set
up
part
of
the
existing,
or
lobbied
for
or
drafted
statutes
that
created
the
existing
law
that's
later
found
to
be
flawed,
but
i
don't
think
that
dispenses
with
the
concept
of
a
reliance
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lott.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
court
of
military
appeals
isn't
established
under
title
28,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace--
--how
is
the
first
round
appellate
panel
of
the
coast
guard
constituted?
do
they
sit...
does
the
court
sit
in
panels
of
three?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
total
membership?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
would
be
possible,
if
you
decided
that
the
two
who
had
sat
previously
should
not
review
it,
still
to
get
a
fully
constituted
panel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
is
it...
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
would
you
ordinarily
have
the
three
military
judges
constituting
a
panel,
or
would
there
always
be
a
civilian
on
the
panel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
lotz,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lotz.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
case
i
am
going
to
announce
is
number
94-431,
ryder
versus
the
united
states,
and
here
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
a
drug
offense
by
a
court
marshall
convened
by
the
coast-guard.
he
appealed
his
sentence
to
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
court
of
military
review
of
the
coast-guard.
the
court
rejected
his
challenge
to
the
appointment
of
two
of
those
judges,
based
on
the
appointments
clause
of
the
constitution
and
it
affirmed
his
conviction.
on
further
appeal,
the
court
of
military
appeals
held
that
the
appointment
of
those
judges
had
violated
the
appointments
clause,
but
it
upheld
petitioner's
conviction
anyway.
it
reasoned
that
the
actions
of
the
improperly
appointed
judges
were
valid
de
facto.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
military
appeals.
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine
confers
validity
on
actions
performed
by
a
person
who
acts
under
the
color
of
official
title
even
though
it's
later
discovered
that
the
legality
of
that
person's
appointment
is
deficient.
cases
in
which
this
court
is
applied,
the
doctrine
defined
the
action
of
judges
and
criminal
matters
valid
de
facto
have
involved
technical
violations
of
designation
statutes,
where
the
defendant
didn?t
raise
the
timely
objection
to
the
officer's
title.
unlike
those
cases,
the
petitioner
here
did
timely
object
to
the
appointment
of
the
appellate
panel
in
a
claim
grounded
in
the
appointments
clause,
and
that
clause
by
preventing
the
diffusion
of
appointment
power
is
the
constitutional
provision
designed
in
part
to
benefit
litigants
and
so,
to
preserve
the
incentive
to
raise
such
challenges
with
respect
to
questionable
judicial
appointments
we
hold
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
question
and
whatever
relief
maybe
appropriate.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
