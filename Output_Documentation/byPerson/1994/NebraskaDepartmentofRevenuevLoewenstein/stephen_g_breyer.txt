justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
key
question
to
me,
i
mean,
these
two
questions
that
justice
kennedy
brought
up
and
this.
i
don't
understand
this
statute,
nebraska
77-2716(e),
which
is
the
addback.
now,
in
order
to
make
this
clear,
i
have
to
take
a
second,
and
i
want
to
use
a
slightly
more
realistic
example.
i
mean,
you've
been
arguing
is
it
really
a
collateralized
loan,
or
is
it
really
a
sale?
well,
it
has
some
characteristics
of
each.
is
a
nectarine
really
a
plum?
is
it
really
a
pear?
is
it
really
an...
i
mean,
it's
some
of
each,
or
whatever.
all
right.
suppose
you
start
there
and
say,
that
doesn't
solve
it.
but
what
might
solve
it
is
that
the
government,
when
it
issues
the
bill
at
an
original
issue
discount,
it's
easy
to
figure
out
what
the
interest
of
that
is.
the
irs
does
it
all
the
time,
and
then
you
allocate
it
daybyday,
and
just
say
the
state
can't
tax
that.
is
that
right,
and
if
that
is
right,
how
does
this
statute
fit
into
it?
i
mean,
let
me
give
you...
suppose
that
the
repoer
has
1
million
dollars
worth
of
treasuries,
90-day
bills.
let's
say
they
pay
15,000
dollars
of
interest
at
6
percent
for
90
days,
and
suppose
what
he
does
is
he
repos
it
out
to
the
ford
motor
company
for
1
day,
which
my
calculation
says
is
worth
about
167
dollars
in
interest.
that
tbill
interest
goes
right
to
the
repoer.
now,
what
the
repoer
has
got
is,
he's
got
1
million
dollars
in
cash
for
a
day,
and
he's
had
to
pay,
say,
150
dollars
for
it.
does
this
nebraska
statute
mean
on
his
tax
return
he
puts
in
167
dollars
of
taxfree
interest,
and
then
reduces
that
by
150
dollars?
to
me,
that's
an
odd
reading
of
the
statute,
because
i
would
say
the
150
is
not
an
expense
of
this
repo
transaction.
rather,
it's
an
expense
related
to
whatever
transaction
he
will
engage
in
with
the
1
million
dollars
cash
that
he's
got.
he
might,
for
example,
take
in...
i
guess
that's
called
a
reverse.
he
takes
in
1
million
dollars
of
treasuries
from
solomon
brothers,
and
what
he
hopes
to
do
is
charge
them
152
dollars
for
that
1-day's
use
of
the
million,
so
he's
got
152
dollars,
subtracts
the
150,
and
it's
2.
that's
how
i'd
read
that
statute
of
nebraska.
but
they've
said,
your
opponents,
that
isn't
how
it's
read,
the
150
dollars
is
allocated
to
the
167
dollars,
and
now
i
want
to
know
from
you,
is
it,
or
isn't
it?
have
you
followed...
have
you
followed
it
all
right?
i'm
sorry
to
be
so...
but
you
see
what
i'm
saying?
i'm
saying
that
the
payment
to
ford,
the
payment
to
ford
from
the
repoer,
is
a
payment
for
the
1
million
dollars
in
cash
that
the
repoer
got.
it
shouldn't
be
allocated
to
the
167
interest
on
those
treasury
bills
that
are
in
the
hands
of
ford
for
the
day.
it
should
be
allocated
to
whatever
income
that
million
dollars
is
used
in
the
hands
of
the
repoer
to
generate.
is
that
the
right
reading
of
the
statute?
if
it
is,
you
are
only
taxing
the...
you're
not...
you're
leaving
the
whole
10
percent,
or
whatever
it
is,
free
of
tax.
if
it
isn't,
you're
taxing
some
of
it.
if
it's
too
complicated
to
follow,
forget
it.
i'm
sorry.
i'll
have
to
find
out
the
answer.
the
question
is,
i
want
to
know
how
this
particular
statute
works,
(e).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
very
bravely
i'm
going
to
try
this
again,
since
i'm
thinking
that
it
seems
quite
important
in
my
mind
as
to
how
the
case
comes
out.
the
repoer
receives
the
interest
on
the
treasury
bills
while
the
bills
are
repoed,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
repoer
pays
some
money
to
the
holder
of
those
bills.
that's
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you're
saying
the
money
he
pays
is
his
own
payment
of
interest.
it's
an
expense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
nebraska
then
gets
its
tax
return,
you
say...
suppose
it
was
5,000
dollars
in
interest.
he
would
say
5,000
dollars
in
interest
was
taxfree.
that's
what
he'd
put
at
the
top.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
he
has
to...
he
then
looks
at
the
statue
and
says,
but
i
paid
4,000.
i
paid
4,000
to
the
holder
of
the
bills
when
they
were
repoed.
does
he
have
to,
in
effect,
subtract
the
4,000
from
the
5,000
so
he
only
has
1,000,
or
does
he
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
he
does
have
to
subtract
the
4,000
from
the
5,000,
as
you
read
the
nebraska
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
we
should
assume
that's
so
for
purposes
of
deciding
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
is
not
whether
it's
legal
to
diminish
it.
the
question
is,
does
it
diminish
it,
and
the
answer
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
i
want
to
go
back,
if
i
can,
to
justice
kennedy's...
it's
the
same
question
i
think
many
of
us
have.
it
starts
with
your
footnote,
and
it...
i'm
thinking
of
the
1
million
dollars
in
treasury
bills.
say
they
issue
for
985,000
dollars,
as
there's
15,000
dollars
you
might
call
an
original
issue
discount.
that's
the
interest.
and
suppose
you
start
with
the
proposition
that
that
15,000
dollars
is
the
amount
the
state
shouldn't
tax--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--forgetting
how
you
characterize
it.
they
can
have
any
kind
of
system
they
want,
within
limits,
as
long
as
they
don't
get
at
that
15,000.
now,
you've
continuously
said,
and
you
do
that
in
your
footnote,
that
it's
that
statute
we've
been
talking
about
that
requires
an
addback
of
some
kind.
you
know
what
i'm
thinking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
as
i
read
that
statute,
it
doesn't.
as
i
read
that
statute,
it
only
requires
an
add
back
of
costs
incurred
to
carry
the
bonds.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you're
not
carrying
the
bonds
when
you've
repoed
them
out
to
general
motors.
general
motors
is
carrying
the
bonds.
rather,
you've
got
1
million
dollars--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you're
going
to
use...
you've
got
1
million
dollars
because
they
have
your
bonds
for
a
day
and
you
have
their
million
for
the
day,
and
so
the
money
that
you're
paying
to
general
motors
for
the
1-day's
loan
of
the
treasury
bills,
so
you
get
the
million,
is
not
a
cost
of
the
treasury's
bills.
it's
a
cost
of
whatever
income
you
use
that
million
in
your
hands
to
get.
so
that's
why
i
read
the
statute,
as
i
read
it
according
to
its
language,
as
not
infringing
on
the
15,000,
but
i
have
to
admit
you've
told
me
it
infringes
on
the
15,000,
and
they
seem
to
concede
the
point,
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
finding
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court
on
the
matter,
and
therefore
i
don't
know
what
to
do.
that's
my
question.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm...
what
i'm
interested
in
is
that
narrow
statute
that
talks
about
adding
back
the
expenses
of
carrying
the
treasury
bills.
if
i
take
it
literally...
i
don't
want
to
just
repeat
myself,
but
if
i
take
it
literally,
you
wouldn't
add
it
back,
because
it
isn't
a
cost
of
carrying
the
treasury
bills,
which
during
the
repo
are
in
the
hands
of
the
person
to
whom
you
have
repoed
them.
rather,
it
is
a
cost
of
whatever
income
you
use
the
money
you
"borrowed"
to
earn.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
wouldn't
add
it
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
you're
right.
if
that's
what
happens,
you
add
it
back
in,
and
if
in
fact
you
had
a
90-day
bill,
and
what
you
did
was,
you
gave
it
to
90
different
people
for
a
day,
you
would
discover
there
was
virtually
no
interest
that
wasn't
taxed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
your
point
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
could
we
do
this,
could
we
say,
suppose
you
said,
look,
the
states
have
to
respect
15,000
dollars
of
the
original
issue
discount,
and
they
have
a
lot
of
leeway
as
to
how
they
do
it,
but
they
have
to
respect
it.
one
way
they
could
do
it
here
is,
they
could
say,
the
repoer
gets
the
15,000,
gets
the
whole
thing,
and
doesn't
deduct
this
as
a
cost.
another
way
they
could
do
it
is
give
it
to
their...
your
client.
we
don't
know
how
nebraska
does
it.
we
send
it
back
to
the
nebraska
supreme
court
and
tell
them
to
decide
nebraska
law
and
how
it
works
out
consistent
with
the
principle.
could
we
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
xx--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
but
if
you're
going
by
the
code
you'd
say,
fine,
you
allocate
the
original
issue
discount
day
by
day,
but
i
don't
know
that
the
federal
code
would
require
giving
days
3
to
the
repoer,
or
to
the
person
who's
holding
the
security,
say,
ford
motor,
or
general
motors.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
code
that
tells
you
the
answer
to
that
question.
the
natural
thing,
if
it's--
