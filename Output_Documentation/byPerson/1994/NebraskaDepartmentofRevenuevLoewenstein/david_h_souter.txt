justice
david
h.
souter
so
we
just
decided,
in
effect,
on
the
hypothetical,
we
assume
that
the
repoer
doesn't
get
it,
and
therefore
you're
left.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
clear
under
the
statute
that
the
repoer
doesn't
get
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
clear
under
the
statute
that
your
client
doesn't
get
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
whereas
the
statute
does
address
the
repoer?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
uncertainty
stems
from
revenue
rulings
under
both,
doesn't
it?
