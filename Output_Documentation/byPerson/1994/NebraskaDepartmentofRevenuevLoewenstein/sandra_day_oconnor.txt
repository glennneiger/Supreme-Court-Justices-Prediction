well,
what
kind
of
unforeseen
consequences
would
result
from
our
characterization
of
this
as
a
loan?
if
there
is
a
bankruptcy
by
the
entity
that
is
acquiring
the
bonds
temporarily,
then
if
it's
the
owner
there
would
be
one
consequence,
if
it
was
a
loan
there
would
be
another.
what
about
treating
the
thing
as
a
loan
for
purposes
of
sec
regulation
of
the
sales?
i
mean,
i'm
concerned
that
calling
it
something
here
may
have
some
unforeseen
consequences.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there
other
instances
where
something
is
characterized
one
way
for
bankruptcy
purposes,
yet
another
way
for
security
purposes,
yet
another
way
for
tax
purposes?
is
that...
is
it
extraordinary
to
have
a
different
characterization
for
tax
purposes
than
for
other
purposes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
know,
mr.
wittler,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
dealt
with
an
aspect
of
this
argument
in
the
bartow
county
board
of
tax
assessors
case,
where
the
court
said
that
the
tax
exemption
required
by
the
constitution
and
section
3124
is
not
a
tax
shelter,
and
federal
obligations
may
be
acquired
in
part
by
liabilities,
and
when
they
are,
a
pro
rata
method
of
allocating
a
fair
share
to
the
liabilities
doesn't
infringe
on
the
immunity.
and
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
runs
somewhat
counter
to
what
the
court
said
in
bartow--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
you
don't
have
to
have
out
there
somewhere
the
full
exemption,
that
if
there...
if
you
borrow
money,
and
you
have
to
offset
the
cost
of
that
to
engage
in
the
purchase
of
the
federal
obligations,
you
lose
some
of
the
exemption.
i
thought
that's
what
this
court
said.
