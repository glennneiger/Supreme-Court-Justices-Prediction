justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska,
it’s
another
tax
case.
respondent
a
nebraska
resident
owns
shares
in
mutual
funds
that
earn
some
of
their
income
by
engaging
in
financial
transactions
called
repurchase
agreements
or
repos
for
short.
in
a
typical
repo
transaction
one
who
holds
federal
debt
securities
whom
we
would
refer
to
as
seller-borrower,
transfers
these
securities
to
the
funds
and
exchange
the
funds
then
pays
the
seller-borrower
specified
amount
of
cash.
at
a
later
date
the
funds
transfer
the
securities
back
to
seller-borrower
returns
the
cash
to
the
funds.
at
that
time
the
seller-borrower
pays
the
funds
interest
at
an
agreed
upon
rate
that
there
is
no
relation
to
the
yield
on
a
security
underline
the
repo.
this
interest
is
in
turn
distributed
to
respondent
in
proportion
to
his
share
of
the
funds.
petitioner
the
nebraska
department
of
revenue
determined
that
respondent
had
to
pay
nebraska
income
tax
on
interest,
income
derived
from
repos
involving
federal
securities.
respondent
challenge
this
ruling
in
the
nebraska
courts,
he
argue
that
taxing
such
income
violated
the
constitution
and
a
federal
statute
that
prohibits
states
from
tax
and
interest
on
federal
securities.
the
trial
court
agreed
with
respondent
and
nebraska
supreme
court
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
nebraska
taxation
of
interest
income
derives
from
the
repos,
does
not
violate
the
federal
statute
or
the
constitution.
for
purposes
of
statute
the
interest
earned
by
the
funds
is
interest
on
loans
from
the
funds
to
the
seller-
borrower,
not
the
interest
on
the
federal
securities.
in
the
repo
context
the
securities
operate
as
collateral
for
the
loans.
numerous
speeches
of
the
repos
are
described
in
detail
in
our
opinion,
lead
to
this
conclusion.
the
funds
and
seller-borrower
characterized
these
repos
as
sales
and
later
repurchases,
but
we
reject
respondent’s
arguments
that
these
labels
preclude
us
from
viewing
the
repos
as
loans.
in
tax
cases
it
is
a
substance
and
economic
realties
over
transaction
account.
the
substance
and
economic
realities
of
the
repos
here
show
that
the
funds
are
receiving
interest
on
cash
that
they
have
loan
to
the
seller-borrower.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
