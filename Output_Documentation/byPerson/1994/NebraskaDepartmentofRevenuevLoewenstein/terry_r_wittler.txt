mr.
terry
r.
wittler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
since
1862,
federal
obligations
have
been,
by
statute,
exempt
from
taxation
by
the
states.
nebraska
statutes
begin
by
recognizing
this
exemption
by
providing
a
deduction
from
a
federal
adjusted
gross
income.
however,
the
nebraska
department
of
revenue
has
adopted
an
administrative
ruling
that
essentially
takes
away
that
exemption
in
the
case
of
repurchase
agreements.
that
revenue
ruling
violates
the
applicable
federal
statute
and
the
supremacy
clause,
and
the
nebraska
supreme
court
reached
the
correct
ruling
when
it
invalidated
that
revenue
ruling.
the
results...
to
reach
that
result,
the
revenue
department
says
that
you
should
disregard
the
way
in
which
the
parties
structured
their
transaction
and
restructure
it
to
fit
their
interpretation.
the
revenue
department's
ruling
does
not
comply
with
this
court's
decision
in
frank
lyons,
which
sets
out
basically
a
threepart
test
for
determining
whether
or
not
the
structure
the
parties
have
chosen
should
be
respected.
first
of
all,
that
case
requires
that
it
be
a
genuine
multiparty
transaction
with
economic
substance,
secondly,
the
form
of
the
transaction
must
be
based
on
business
and
economic
realities,
and
thirdly,
it
must
be
based
on
taxindependent
considerations.
it
may
not
have
been
structured
that
way
solely
to
avoid
tax.
the
transactions
in
this
situation,
these
repurchase
agreements,
meet
each
of
those
three
tests
under
frank
lyons,
and
accordingly
the
government
should
be
required
to
respect
the
form
in
which
the
parties
have
chosen
to
structure
their
transaction.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
think
that
frank
lyon
was
the
beall
and
endall.
i
think,
though,
that
any...
the
form
that
you
choose
is
not
determinative
in
this
case.
the
way
in
which
you
read
frank
lyon,
or
the
way
in
which
you
might
adjust
the
holding
of
frank
lyon
is
really
not
determinative,
because
the
state's
position
is,
we
don't
look
at
any
of
those
aspects.
we
look
solely
at
the
socalled
economic
substance,
and
that's
the
only
test
we
apply,
and
we
apply
it
as
we
see
fit,
and
we
reach
the
result
that
we
choose.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
begs
the
question,
and
let
me
explain
why.
economics
strives
to
be
valuefree.
it
tries
to
be
valueneutral.
the
law,
on
the
other
hand,
is
valuedriven,
it's
valueladen,
and
let
me
give
you
some
examples
of
why
i
think
that
begs
the
question.
if
i
have
a
widget
factory,
and
i
hire
12-year-old
children,
or
i
hire
adults,
to
an
economist,
he
or
she
would
say,
the
economic
substance
of
those
two
transactions
is
the
same.
but
the
law
says
no,
a
very
different
result
comes
about.
if
i
hire
a
salesperson
to
sell
my
widgets,
and
i
pay
him
or
her
a
commission,
the
law
says
it's
deductible.
if
i
pay
a
bribe
to
someone
to
purchase
my
widgets,
the
law
says
that's
unlawful.
an
economist
says
those
two
payments
are
exactly
the
same
for
economic
substance.
the
law
says,
we
don't
care,
we
treat
them
dramatically
different.
if
i
borrow
100,000
dollars
for
a
vacation
home,
my
interest
is
taxdeductible.
if
i
borrow
100,000,
buy
an
rv
to
go
to
exactly
the
same
place
for
a
vacation,
it's
not
taxdeductible.
that's
why...
that's
the
basic
fallacy
of
the
state's
approach,
is
to
look
solely
at
economic
substance.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
it
does,
your
honor,
but
that...
and
that
structure
is
chosen
by
the
parties
for
reasons
independent
of
the
tax
considerations,
and
i
think
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
that
a
significant
part
of
this
market,
participants
in
this
market,
are
municipalities,
school
districts,
agencies
that
pay
no
tax.
they
enter
into
repurchase
agreements
not
for
tax
reasons,
but
because
of
business
and
regulatory
concerns
that
they
have
to
meet.
and
i
want
to
go
back
just
one
moment
to
what
i
feel
is
the
basic
fallacy
of
the
economic
analysis.
if
i
loan
10,000
dollars
to
general
motors,
and
i
loan
10,000
dollars
to
the
united
states
treasury,
the
economic
substance
of
those
two
transactions
is
identical.
but
congress
has
said
the
500
dollars
that
i
earn
on
one
is
fully
taxable,
and
the
500
dollars
on
the
other
is
not
taxable
by
the
state,
and
that's
what
we're
here
to
talk
about.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
justice--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--because
nebraska
doesn't
have
a
supremacy
clause,
and
the
u.s.
congress
does,
and
in
the
recent
case
involving
south
carolina
v.
baker,
this
court
held
that
the
exemption
of
municipal
bonds
interest
is
statutorily
based.
it's
granted
by
congress.
it
has
no
constitutional
features.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
that's
not
what
i
mean
to
say,
your
honor.
if
congress...
if
3124
was
repealed
tomorrow,
we'd
still
have
a
problem
with
the
nebraska
approach,
because
it
singles
out
federal
obligations
and
doesn't
mention
state
obligations,
so
it
discriminates.
but
no,
our
basic
position
is
it's
based
on
the
statute.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
number
1,
to
answer
that
question.
i
don't
know
for
a
fact
how
they
treat
them.
what
i
know
is
that
the
department
of
revenue
apparently
thought
it
necessary
to
adopt
this
regulation
to
reach
federal
repo
income,
and
it
has
not
seen
fit
to
adopt
a
similar
regulation
to
allow
it
to
meet
state
of
nebraska
repo
income,
so
all
i
know
is
that
there's
a
ruling
that
addresses
federal,
none
that
addresses
state,
and
i
believe
under
those
circumstances
it
discriminates.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
i
can
give
you
a
theory,
your
honor.
the
united
states
may
have
an
interest
on
the
one
hand
in
seeing
that
the
exemption
is
preserved,
because
that
reduces
costs,
borrowing
costs
to
the
treasury,
in
which
case
they
would
side
with
us,
and
there
may
be
persons
within
the
united
states
who
are
concerned
about
maintaining
the
validity
of
union
planners
in
that
line
of
cases
and
going
after
revenue
arising
from
municipal
bonds
who
would
be,
their
interest
being
with
the
nebraska,
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
way
nebraska
has
structured
its
approach,
which
is
a
very
curious
way
to
do
it,
it
starts
with
the
federal...
your
federal
adjusted
gross
income,
which
includes
revenue
from
the
united
states,
because
it's
taxable
at
the
federal
level.
and
then
it
says,
okay,
now
you
can
back
out
your
interest
on
federal
obligations,
unless
you
borrowed
some
money
to
help
hold
those
obligations.
if
you
borrowed
some
money
from
general
motors
or
from
anybody
else,
you
don't
get
to
back
it
all
out,
you
just
get
to
back
out
the
part
that
is
offset
by
a
deduction,
and
that's
where
we
lose
the
parity
with
the
federal
approach,
because
the
federal
approach--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
i
am,
because
the
statute
says,
their
position
is,
even
though
i've
loaned...
i've
sold
these
to
somebody
else,
i
really
own
them.
if
i
really
own
them,
i
must...
but
yet
i'm
paying
interest
to
somebody,
i
must
be
paying
that
interest
to
carry
the
obligations.
in
other
words,
i
own
the
obligations.
i'm
carrying
them,
even
though
i've
loaned
them
out,
and
that
is
what
2716(1)(e)
says.
if
you've
paid
that
interest
to
carry
those
obligations,
we're
going
to
take
away
your
federal
exemption,
we're
going
to
narrow
it
down,
chew
it
down,
and
that's
where
the
loss
comes
in.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
yes.
if
you
disregard
the
statute
that
says
you
don't
get
the
full
benefit,
you
do
get
the
full
benefit,
that's
absolutely
true,
and
the
reasons
go
back
to
an
earlier
question--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--i
agree
that
at
a
federal
level,
in
terms
of
the
statutory
scheme,
you're
right,
as
long
as
somebody
gets
it,
the
statute's
complied
with.
the
problem,
and
the
reason
why
you
have
to
be
careful
how
you
draft
a
statute
to
achieve
that
result,
goes
back
to
this
court's
holding
in
denman
v.
slayton
way
back
in
1930.
if
you
allow
people
to
simply
pass
the
obligation
back
and
forth
by
borrowing
to
buy
exempt
obligations,
then
you
face
a
situation
where
i've
got
10,000
dollars
in
salary
income,
and
i
decide
i'm
going
to
go
out
to
my
local
bond
dealer,
borrow
10,000
dollars
worth
of
securities,
or
borrow
100,000
dollars
worth
of
securities,
pay
them
10,000
dollars
in
interest,
receive
10,000
from
the
government,
offset
the
two,
bingo,
i
pay
no
tax.
not
only
do
i
not
pay
tax
on
the
interestfree
income,
but
i've
got
a
nice
deduction
for
interest
that
i
can
offset
against
my
salary,
and
i
wash
my
hands.
i
pay
no
interest.
that's
why
the
scheme
of
265
was
developed,
and
that's
why
you've
got
to
have
an
offset
one
place
and
add
back
another.
it
makes
a
difference
from
a
tax
equity
point
of
view.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
justice--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--bartow
county
dealt
with
a
net
worth
tax,
and
a
net
worth,
the
net
worth
is
an
abstraction.
it's
not
a
tax
of
your
assets.
it's
not
a
tax
against
your
liabilities.
what
the
taxpayer
wanted
to
do
in
bartow
county
was
say,
i've
got
these
nontaxable
assets,
i've
got
these
liabilities,
they
cancel
each
other
out,
and
what
i
have
left
is
tax
exempt.
what
the
taxing
authority
wanted
to
do
was
just
reverse
it
and
say,
no,
we're
going
to
offset
your
liabilities
against
your
exempt
obligations,
and
everything
you've
got
that's
left
is
fully
taxable,
and
the
compromise
was,
realistically,
was
to
say
no,
we
have
to
offset
them.
we
have
to
have
them
be
pro
rata,
and
the
tax
exempt
can
bear
their
fair
share
of
the
burden.
here,
the
state
is
saying
no,
not
only
are
you
not
going
to
get
a
double
benefit,
you're
not
going
to
get
any
benefit.
we're
going
to
treat
you
just
like
if
you'd
gone
out
and
bought
a
fully
taxable
obligation
for
general
motors
or
anybody
else.
that's
realistically
the
only
reason
that
the
state
department
of
revenue
adopts
a
ruling
like
this,
is
to
earn
some
money
for
the
state,
and
if
you
run
through
the
arithmetic,
they
will
increase
their
revenues
by
exactly
the
amount
of
repurchase
revenue
they
recapture,
and
to
take
my
example
of
the
total
of
500
dollars
in
interest
that
the
federal
treasury
writes
a
check
for,
it
slowly
disappears,
the
more
and
more
people
down
the
road
who
have
repurchase
obligations,
and
that's
why
it's
basically
a
violation
of
the
statutes.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
right.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
yes,
i
do.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
that's
right.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
i
agree--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--well,
you
can
affirm
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
but--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--your
honor,
if
you
adopt
their
position
that
we--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--but
your
honor,
this
language--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--tracks
section
265,
and
there
is
extensive
litigation
history
about
how
you
decide
whether
you
add
it
back
in
or
not,
and
the
cases
consistently
take
the
position
that
with
repos
you
add
it
back
in.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
that's
right.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
that's
our
position.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
no,
your
honor.
the...
it's
a
twostep
addback.
we
start
at
the
federal
level,
where
the
income
is
included,
because
federal
law
says--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--yes.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
well,
i'd
have
no
case,
but
i'd
also
owe
no
tax.
i
would
have
gotten
an
exemption.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
that's
right.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
all
right.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
right.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
right.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
that's
right,
but
loewenstein
would
know
that
he
was
going
to
lose,
and
he
would
say
to
the
repoer,
i'm
not
going
to
cut
the
deal
that
i
cut
with
you
last
year,
because
now
i
know
i'm
going
to
have
to
pay
tax
on
it,
so
now
i
want
more
money,
because
i'm
going
to
have
to
pay
tax.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
yes.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
because
the...
they
have
a
choice
only
in
the
sense
they
have
to
do
it
the
constitutional
way.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
i'm
saying
somebody
has
to
get
it.
they've
said
nobody
gets
it.
if--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--it
hasn't.
i
think
no
authority.
i
think
all
it
can
do
is
interpret
3124,
that
says,
somebody
gets
it,
and
nebraska
says
nobody
gets
it.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
and
that
violates
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
but
as--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--i
pointed
out,
money
is
fungible.
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
we
could
redraft
the
contract
tomorrow
to
say
it's
cut
the
other
way,
and
the
net
effect
is
the
same.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
first
of
all,
your
honor,
nebraska
law
incorporates
by
reference
federal
tax
law.
even
if
it
didn't,
31
u.s.c.
3124(b)
says,
in
determining
the
tax
status
of
interest,
we
look
at
federal
law.
federal
law
has
made
a
policy
decision
that
we're
going
to
prorate
that
zero
coupon
interest
over
a
period
of
time,
and
i
don't
know,
but
i
presume
the
reason
is
because
otherwise
people
could
wait
till
the
day
before
that
comes
due,
run
out,
buy
it,
say,
"even
though
i've
only
owned
this
30-year
bond
1
day,
all
of
the
interest
in
this
last
payment
is
mine.
"
and
that
leads
to
the
sorts
of
tax
manipulation
that
the
court
found
unacceptable
in
the
frank
lyon
case.
but
here,
the
basic
principle
is
that
somebody
has
to
get
tax
exempt
interest
income
according
to
the
statute,
and
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
nebraska,
they
have
tried
to
take
away
at
least
a
portion
of
that
exemption.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
because--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--because
nebraska
has
said,
in
a
separate
statute,
mr.
repoer,
you
clearly
don't
get
it.
we're
not
going
to
give
it
to
you
because
you've
entered
into
a
repurchase
arrangement,
and
you've
been
paying
out
interest
over
time.
we're
not
going
to
let
you
get
the
deduction.
they've
taken
that
position.
if
that's
their
position,
then
i
say
somebody's
got
to
get
it,
and
my
guy
was
the
one
who
should
have
got
it,
and
you
can
work
through
the
arithmetic
in
the
statute
to
show
why
he
should
have.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
it's
a
hypothetical.
it's
simply,
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
says--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--i
believe
it's
clear,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
it's
clear
under
the
revenue
rule
that
my
client
doesn't
get
it.
the
statute
does
not
address
that.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
no,
sir.
there's
a
statute
that
talks
about
taking
interest
deductions,
and
there's
a
statute
that
talks
about
excluding
federal
obligations.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
he
gets
the
same
benefit,
your
honor,
that
he
would
have
gotten
if
he
bought
a
fully
taxable
obligation.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
he
gets
an
interest
deduction.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
yes,
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
it
was
a
taxable
or
nontaxable--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--but
where
did
the...
where
did
the
other
500
go?
that's
the
question.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
but
then
we
have
two
people
who
have
gotten
500
dollars,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
it's
a
business
expense,
and
it
goes
against
the
taxexempt
income,
except--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--no,
your
honor.
i
agree,
for
one
party
to
the
transaction,
he
gets
a
deductionfree
interest
payment,
just
like
he'd
get
whether
he
was
dealing
in
taxable
or
taxexempt
obligations,
and
he
gets
a
little,
tiny
exemption
for
what's
left
over,
the
difference
between
the
500
and
600.
he
gets
100.
but
no...
the
remainder
paid
by
the
federal
government
goes
to
somebody
else
who
now
becomes
fully
taxable,
and
that's
the
evil
in
the
approach
the
state
of
nebraska
takes.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
you
certainly
could
do
that,
your
honor,
but
the
federal
law
says--
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
--it
will
be
governed
by
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
the
internal
revenue
code
explains
how
we
allocate
these
payments
that
occur
over
time,
so...
and
nebraska
law
then
incorporates
by
reference
the
federal
internal
revenue
code,
so
it
wouldn't
advance
us
a
great
deal.
mr.
terry
r.
wittler
thank
you.
