justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--nebraska
requires
the
addback?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
does
bring
up
the
question
that
if
you're
wrong
about
3124
and
what
it
requires,
it
may
not
follow
that
loewenstein
or
the
mutual
fund
is
the
person
nebraska
would
look
at
to
make
the
cure?
what
about
just
not
allowing...
not
requiring
the
addback?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
if
the
argument
is
that
what
3124
requires
is
that
every
dollar
of
interest
be
fully
reflected,
i
suppose
nebraska
could
do
that
two
ways.
one
way
would
be
to
say,
loewenstein
gets
the
benefit.
another
way
would
be
to
say
this
person,
whatever
we
call...
the
repoer,
some
briefs
have
called
it,
doesn't
have
to
add
back
the
expense
of
the
financing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
would
you
pick
one
or
the...
would
you
be...
do
you
know
which
one
nebraska
would
pick
if
it
were
required
to
make
that
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
part
of
your
response
that
in
respect
to
how
you
treat
that
deal,
you
treat
it
just
the
way
the
feds
treat
municipal
and
state
bonds
with
respect
to
the
addback
of
the
expense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
that's
what
the
system
was.
it's
exactly
tracking
what
the
feds
do.
but
how
do
you
treat
state
and
municipal
bonds,
the
same
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
the
treatment
is
the
same.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
what
extent
does
nebraska
copy,
or
is
it
guided
by,
how
the
federal
authorities
treat
repo
arrangements?
do
you
look
at
these
individual...
these
different
deals
on
your
own,
or
is
there
some
attempt
at
conformity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
interstate
cooperation,
since
many
states
are
your
friends
in
this
matter?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
you
are
saying
is
you
are
essentially
treating
this
like
a
secured
loan?
the
parties
are
concerned
that
you're
treating
this
as
though
it
were
a
borrowing
to
finance
the
purchase
of
these
bills.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
distinguish
the
situation
of
the
municipal
bond
and
the
federal
taxation?
municipal
bonds
are
also
exempt,
but
if
we
were
talking
about
municipal
bonds
and
the
taxing
authority
is
the
federal
government,
then
i
believe
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
the
interest...
that
the
interest
to
the
reserver
would
be
taxable.
but
you
say...
so
explain...
the
same
kinds
of
transactions,
but
on
the
one
hand
tbills
and
the
state
taxing
authority,
and
the
other
hand,
municipal
bonds
and
the
federal
taxing
authority.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
can't
nebraska
say,
we
want
to
do
the
same
thing
that
the
feds
are
doing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
so
you're
resting
not
just...
it's
not
just
what
3124
means,
but
you're
saying
the
constitution
requires
that,
so
even
if
congress
was
explicit
in
3124,
and
says,
and
we
don't
mean
that
the
interest
paid
to
the
reverser
is
not
income,
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
rejecting
what
we
were
just
told,
that...
we
were
just
told
that
nebraska
treats
state,
its
obligations
the
same
way,
and
you're
saying
it
doesn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
has
been,
so
far
as
i
know,
no
voice
from
the
u.s.
side,
the
treasury
side,
in
all
of
this,
and
you
are
not
exactly
in
the
position
of
mcculloch
in
this
case.
with
all
the
friends
that
are
appearing,
is
there
any
reason
why
we
have
not
had
any
position
for
the
united
states?
if
the
idea
is
that
3124
means
that
you
can't
have
this
addback
for
the...
why
have
we
heard
nothing
but
silence
from
the
federal
government?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
should
loewenstein
or
the
mutual
funds
prevail
in
any
event?
why
isn't
the
flaw,
if
there
be
a
flaw,
that
the
addback...
if...
your
theory
about
what
3124
requires
doesn't
mean
that
loewenstein
has
to
be
the
one
to
get
the
tax
benefit.
it
could
be
the
repoer
by
not
charging
him
with
the
addback.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
all
right,
got
it.
but
then
this
entire
case,
this
entire
controversy
comes
up
because...
because
of
the
requirement
of
the
addback.
in
other
words,
if
nebraska
didn't
have
that
requirement,
you
would
have
no
case,
loewenstein
would
have
no
case,
is
that
right?
nevada--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--let's
just--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--focus
on
this
part
about
the
addback
that
the
repoer
has
to
do
under
nebraska
law.
if
nebraska
didn't
require
that,
you
would
have
no
case,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
you
have
gotten
the
exemption?
isn't
it...
if
nebraska...
you,
i
thought,
are
arguing
for
loewenstein--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
the
repoer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
the
repoer
doesn't
get
all
the
interest,
and
doesn't
have
to
add
back
any...
any
offsetting
cost
of
borrowing
for
whatever
the
borrowing
is
for--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
every
dollar
is
accounted
for,
but
the
repoer
gets
it
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
reverser
gets
interest
income.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
that's
the
position
that
nebraska
took,
there
would
be
no
argument
under
3124,
and
loewenstein
would
lose,
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
i'm
right
about
nebraska
having
a
choice,
if
what
they're
doing
is
not
permissible,
then
they
have
a
choice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
should
a
court,
a
federal
court,
make
that
choice
for
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
told
me
the
constitution
doesn't
care
about
whether
the
repoer
or
the
reverser
gets
the
benefit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
they...
even
if...
even
if
that...
even
if
you
would
prevail
on
that
point,
somebody
gets
it,
what
authority
does
this
court
have
to
say
which
somebody
it
should
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
have
just
one
question
about
why
nebraska
is
not
taking
the
position
that
california
and
some
other
states
have
taken
that
all
of
this
is
beside
the
point,
because
what
loewenstein
receives
is
simply
a
taxable
dividend
from
the
mutual
fund.
