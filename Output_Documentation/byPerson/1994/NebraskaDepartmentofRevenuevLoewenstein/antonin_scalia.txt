justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
the
normal
sale
of
treasury
bonds,
couldn't
you?
if
you
sell
a
bond
that
has
a
certain
maturity
price,
and
if,
in
fact,
rates
for
other
obligations
have
gone
up,
the
money
you
get
won't
depend
upon
the
face
interest
on
the
government
obligation.
it
will
depend
upon
what
the
market
is
at
the
time,
won't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet
that
transaction,
you
acknowledge,
is
exempt
from
taxation,
is
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i'm...
that
factor
is
irrelevant,
once
you
acknowledge
that
in
just
a
straight
sale
of
a
treasury
bond,
it...
the
amount
you
pay
for
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
interest
rate
on
the
face
of
the
bond.
it
has
to
do
with
what
the
going
market
is,
so
i
don't
see
how
that's
a
point
for
you
at
all,
the
fact
that
the
interest
rate
depends
on
market
rate.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bartel,
i
have
a
problem
with
your
urging
us
to
look
at
the
economic
reality
of
the
transaction.
i
mean,
there
are
various
levels
of
economic
reality,
i
suppose.
certainly
one
reality
is
that
as
a
result
of
this
transaction
the
buyer
owns
the
treasury
bills
for,
you
know,
for
the
period,
and
that
is
real.
the
buyer
really
owns
them,
right?
is
not
the
buyer
the
owner
during
that
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well,
you're
raising
exactly
my
point.
we
want
to
talk
about
this
case.
we're
going
to
have
to
examine
these
repo
agreements
one
by
one
to
determine
what...
you
know,
what
the
economic
reality
of
this
particular
repurchase
agreement
is.
why
isn't
it
much
simpler,
for
purposes
of
the
administration
of
the
federal
tax
law,
to
say
whoever
owns
them
gets
the
deduction,
period,
work
it
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
lay
the
ground
rules
such
as
what,
such
as
whether
the
agreement,
as
in
this
case,
does
not
give
full
indicia
of
ownership?
justice
antonin
scalia
each
case
is
a
different
inquiry.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
going
to
be
a
very
narrow
decision
you're
asking
us
to
write,
this
just
in
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
repo
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but...
this
is
just
repeating
justice
ginsburg's
question,
but
i
still
don't
understand
your
answer
to
it.
granted
what
you've
just
said,
that
they've
taken
away
the
interest
income,
somebody's
entitled
to
get
it,
don't
you
have
more
of
a
case
to
make
than
that?
don't
you
have
to
show
that
your
client
is
entitled
to
get
it,
and
all
we
can
say
is,
somebody's
entitled
to
get
it?
why
does
that
mean
that
you
win?
i
mean,
you're
claiming--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
claiming
that
nebraska
has
to
give
it
to
your
client,
not
to
the
repoer.
why
is
that?
whereas
all
you
come
before
us
and
say
is,
nebraska
has
to
give
it
to
either
my
client
or
the
repoer.
