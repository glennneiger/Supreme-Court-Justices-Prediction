justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
respondent's
brief,
the
red
brief
at
about
page...
it's
at
page
26...
he
sets
forth
a
hypothetical
transaction
where
a
10,000
dollar
treasury
bill
is
due
in
360
days,
and
he
has
a
series
of
hypotheticals,
and
the
first
one,
of
course,
is
if
the
taxpayer
just
holds
it
for
360
days,
and
he
paid
9,500
dollars
for
it,
he
redeems
it
for
10,000
dollars,
there's
then
500
dollars
worth
of
interest,
and
all
of
that
is
covered
by
the
exemption.
everybody
agrees
with
that.
do
you
agree
with
his
second
example...
i
take
it
you
do...
that
if
the
bill
is
sold,
just
as
an
outright
sale,
no
repo
agreement,
just
an
outright
sale,
180
days
down
the
road,
that
the
exemption
of
500
dollars
is
given
250
to
each
holder?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
it's
correct
that
if
i
own
a
bill
for
180
days,
a
360-day
bill,
and
i
then
transfer
it
to
a
second
holder,
we
each
split
the
exemption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
they
each
get
the
exemption
under
nebraska
law,
don't
they?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
now,
when
we
get
to
the
repo
transaction,
do
you
agree
with
the
characterization
he
gives
of
how
the
repo
transaction
works?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
nebraska
law
under
your
theory,
if
you
prevail,
will
the
full
500
dollars
of
exemption
be
accorded
to
someone
in
this
transaction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
nebraska
law
in
the
repo
transaction,
would
the
original
holder
who
is
the
sellerborrower
receive
under
this
hypothetical
a
500
dollar
exemption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
important
because
if
the
answer
is
yes,
which
is
the
answer
you've
given,
that
diminishes
the
exemption,
doesn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
economic
sense
of
it
is
that
if
the
person
who
has
the
cash
derived
from
the
collateralized
loan,
if
that's
what
you
want
to
call
it,
uses
that
cash
to
earn
money
from,
say,
a
general
motors
instrument,
or
something
like
that,
that
that
is
outside
nonexempt
income,
and
that
the
cost
of
that
is
outside
expenses
that
are
offset
against
the
outside
income,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
your
statute
does
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
that
is
so,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
respondents
may
have
a
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
you're
asking
us
to
recharacterize
the
transaction
that
the
parties
have...
have
engaged
in
here
in
an
economic
sense,
so
we
are
simply
asking
you
in
an
economic
sense
whether
or
not
the
full
exemption
is
being
accorded
to
one
or
both
of
the
parties
under
your
accounting
system,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying
well,
maybe
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
bears
upon
the
wisdom
or
the
prudence
of
our
allowing
you
to
recharacterize
the
transaction
in
the
way
that
you
seek
to
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
is,
because
if
one
or
the
other
theories,
and
i'm
not
sure
which
one
it
is,
operates
to
deprive
securities
of
their
economicexempt
status,
then
the
purpose
of
the
statute...
then
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
contravened,
and
we
interpret
the
law
according
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
so
we
do
begin
by
asking
what
is
the
economic
effect
on
the
market
for
federal
securities,
on
the
grant
or
the
denial
of
the
full
exemption
to
which
the
securities
are
entitled,
and
we're
asking
that,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
structure
of
the
transaction
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
a
third
possibility
be
that
under
either
theory
the
full
exemption
is
allowed
and
therefore
the
market
is
unaffected?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
seems
to
me
quite
a
plausible
theory
if
they
deprive
you
of
any
of
the
exemption,
because
then
it
works
out,
and
that's
the
problem
i
have
with
your
footnote
at
page
29.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
comparing
apples
and
oranges,
or
nectarines
and
peaches,
whatever
we're
using
here
today.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you
disregard
nebraska's
addback
to
the
borrower's
interest
expense
deduction,
does
the
borrower
otherwise
get
the
full
benefit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
it
seems
to
me
quite
plausible
for
nebraska
to
say
that
you
don't
get
it,
because
by
your
contract,
you
pay
all
of
the
federal
interest
back.
loewenstein
pays
all
of
the
federal
interest
back
to
the
original
holder.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
that
might
make
a
difference.
well,
suppose...
think
about
it
in
terms
of
a
zero
coupon
bond,
and
there's
just
one
coupon
that's
clipped
at
the
end
of
the
line,
and
that's
the
person
that
gets
the
interest,
and
in
the
meantime
there's
a
repo
transaction,
and...
and
the
dealer
transfers
the
federal
obligation
to
the
repoer,
and
the
repoer
has
to
pay...
pays
the
money
over
and
receives
interest
for
that,
which
is
not
the
interest
on
the
federal
obligation.
i
mean,
why
cannot
the
state
tax
that
interest
quite
properly,
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
line,
whoever
owns,
presumably
the
dealer
by
that
time,
the
bond
with
the
coupon
will
clip
the
coupon,
get
the
interest,
and
get
the
deduction?
