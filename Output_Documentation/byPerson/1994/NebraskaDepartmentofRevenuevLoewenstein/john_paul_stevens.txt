yes,
but
isn't
it
true
that
although
the...
let's
assume
there's
600
dollars
of
federal
interest,
and
500
dollars
of
interest
paid
to
the
buyerlender.
now,
the
500
doesn't
reduce
the
amount
of
the
government
interest
that's
exempt
from
tax,
but
is
it
not
available
as
an
ordinary
deduction
for
interest
payments
in
connection
with
what
the
person
wanted
to
use
the
money
for?
he
does
get
the
benefit
from
it
in
a
different
form,
does
he
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
does
therefore
get
the
benefit
of
the
deduction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
instead
of
treating
it
as
600
of
taxfree
income,
he
treats
it
as
100
of
taxfree
income
and
a
500
deduction
from
your
gross
income,
which
brings
you
out
to
the
same
figure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
other
500
is
income
to
the
person
who
lent
the
money.
the
500
is
interest
to
the
buyerlender.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
one
of
them's
a
deduction,
one
of
them's
income.
it's
true
that...
i
understand
what
you're
saying
about
changing
the
character
of
it.
it's
not
federal
income
exempt
from
taxation
under
the
statute,
but
the
500
dollars
is
a
business
expense,
i
should
think,
because
it's
the
cost
of
borrowing
that
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
it
brings
you
down
to
the
same
amount
of
taxable
income,
it
seems
to
me.
maybe
i'm
missing
something.
