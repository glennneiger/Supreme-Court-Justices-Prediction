mr.
l.
jay
bartel
yes,
your...
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
section
3124,
title
31
of
the
united
states
code,
prohibits
state
taxation
of
federal
obligations
and
the
interest
thereon.
this
prohibition
extends
to
every
form
of
state
taxation
that
considers
in
its
computation
federal
obligations
or
the
interest
on
federal
obligations.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
nebraska's
taxation
of
income
received
by
a
mutual
fund
shareholder
derived
from
repurchase
agreements
involving
federal
obligations
violates
section
3124,
repurchase
agreements
which
we
believe,
in
essence,
were
transactions
that
in
substance
were
loans
between
private
parties
secured
by
federal
obligations.
the
nebraska
supreme
court
erred
in
holding
that
nebraska's
tax
violated
section
3124.
the
computation
of
nebraska's
tax
did
not
consider
directly
or
indirectly
either
federal
obligations
or
interest
on
federal
obligations.
the
repurchase
agreements
entered
into
by
the
mutual
funds
which
distributed
income
to
respondent
loewenstein
were
in
essence
secured
loans
in
which
federal
obligations
merely
served
as
collateral.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
repurchase
agreements
are
called
repos
for
short,
and
they're
in
essence
contracts
involving
the
simultaneous
sale
and
future
repurchase
of
an
asset,
usually
treasury
securities.
repos
generally
consist
of
what
is
a
twopart
transaction.
in
step
1,
the
party
that
holds
federal
securities,
denominated
as
the
seller,
transfers
the
securities
to
another
party,
the
buyer,
in
exchange
for
cash.
in
this
case
the
buyer
would
have
been
the
mutual
funds.
the
second
step
consists
of
a
contemporaneous
agreement
by
the
seller
to
repurchase
the
securities
at
the
original
sale
price,
plus
an
agreedupon
amount
of
interest
at
a
rate
specified
in
the
agreement.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
interest
paid
by
the
seller
is
based
on
prevailing
market
rates
on
loans
or
financing
transactions
of
similar
maturity
and
risk.
in
fact,
it
was
stipulated
below
that
the
interest
paid
by
the
seller
on
repurchase
is
less
than
the
interest
rate
accruing
on
the
underlying
obligations.
that
was
in
the
second
stipulation,
paragraph
19.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
that
is
true.
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
yes.
the
distinction
here,
your
honor,
is
that
the
way
the
repurchase
agreement
is
structured,
that
the
funds
in
essence
are
never,
the
owner
is
entitled
to
the
federal
exemption.
what
they
receive
is
interest
at
a
rate
agreed
to
between
private
parties
that
really
doesn't
bear
a
relation
to
the
interest
rate,
and
more
importantly--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--it
is
in
purposes
of
the
overall
analyzation,
i
think,
of
the
nature
of
the
agreements,
because
what
we
are
contending,
again,
is
that
the
real
substance,
the
true
substance
of
the
agreements
is
that
the
mutual
funds
were
not
the
true
owners
or
substantive
owners
of
the
underlying
obligations.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
adopt
a
secured
loan
characterization
of
all
repos
for
all
purposes.
with
respect
to
your
concern
regarding
the
treatment
of
the
purchase
agreements
in
bankruptcy,
congress
has
in
large
part,
of
course,
dealt
with
that
concern
by
an
amendment
to
the
bankruptcy
code.
there
may
be
purposes
for
securities
law
transactions
to
be
viewed
again
as
differently.
it's
pointed
out
in
the
amicus
briefs
filed
by
the
investment
company
institute
and
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
new
york
that
not
all
repos
are
identical
to
the
precise
transactions
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
i
would
not
think
so,
although
i
don't
have
any
ready
examples.
i
think
the
mere
fact
that
when
you
look
at
repos
themselves
and
that
there
has
been
a
division
of
the
characterization
and
treatment,
depending
upon
the
purpose
served,
even
the
bankruptcy
decisions,
the
bevill
case,
that
discuss
the
characterization
of
repos
for
tax
purposes
recognize
that
there
may
be
different
reasons
why
a
rule
or
a
principle
of
construction
should
be
adopted
for
tax
purposes
that
is
different
than
the
concerns
in
a
bankruptcy
context.
and
that,
in
essence,
is
why
we
think
that
the
economic
substance
principle,
which
has
been
recognized
by
federal
courts,
construing
the
exemption
of
repurchase
agreements
involving
cases
construing
section
103
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
deals
with
the
exemption
of
interest
on
state
and
local
obligations,
and
state
court
cases
that
have
also
relied
on
the
economic
substance
analysis
to
look
at--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--it
appears
in
the
hypothetical
that
what
he's
dealing
with
is
a
shortterm
treasury
bill
that
may
be
an
obligation
issued
with
discount.
that,
to
the
extent
that
i
believe
that
is
the
nature
of
the
hypothetical,
that
is
correct,
but
we
don't--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--i
believe
under
the
oid
rules
under
the
federal
income
tax
code
there
would
be...
if
you
are
the
actual
holder
and
there
is
a
transfer
in
substantive
owner,
then
that
holder
who
is
a
substantive
owner
is
required
to
report
that
portion
as
income,
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
no,
we
do
not,
your
honor,
because
we
believe
it,
again
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
fails
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
funds
do
not
receive
exempt
interest
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
we
believe
that
it
is
accorded
to
someone
in
the
transaction.
it
is
accorded
to
the
sellerborrowerrepurchaser.
they
are
the
substantive
owner
of
the
obligations,
and
they're
the
ones
who
maintain
the
entitlement
to
the
exemption.
now,
what
respondent
seems
to
be
saying
is
that
the
fact
that
most
states
have
a
statute
which
disallows
deduction
for
interest
expense
incurred
to
carrier
hold
the
federal
obligation.
now,
the
sellerborrower
may
be
required
to
make
application
of
such
a
statute
if
it
pays
interest,
to
hold
or
acquire
that
federal
obligation.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
yes,
most
states
do,
that's
correct.
in
fact,
i
think
all
states
do
according
to
amicus
investment
company
institute.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
well,
the
effect
of
the
addback
provision
could
be
to
reduce
the
economic
benefit.
they
would
still
receive
a
500
dollar
exemption,
but
there
may
be
a
requirement
to
add
back,
but
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
an
impairment
or
a
violation
of
section
3121.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
that
would
be
an
application
to
the
dealer.
it
would
not
be
an
application--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--it's
our
position,
of
course,
that
section
3124
doesn't
require
that
result,
and
we
would
rely
on
the
court's
decision
on
first
national
bank
of
atlanta
v.
bartow
county.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
we
attempted
to
respond
in
our
brief
with
a
response
to
their
example.
i
hope
that's...
that's
adequate.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
in
our
view,
the
nebraska
statute
is
the
counterpart
to
internal
revenue
code
section
265,
which
denies
interest
expense
deduction
incurred
to
carry
state
and
local
obligations,
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
in
repo
transactions?
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
the
nebraska
statute
only
exempts
from
state
taxation
interest
earned
from
ownership
of
nebraskabased
obligations.
it
does
not,
on
its
face,
exempt
repo
interest
attributable
to
transactions
involving
nebraskabased
obligations,
so
it's
our
position
in
nebraska,
consistent
with
our
taxation
of
repo
income
involving
federal
obligations,
that
that,
too,
would
be
subject
to
nebraska
income
tax.
there
is
no
discrimination,
contrary
to
the
argument
that
respondent
has
made.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
yes.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
we
would
take
the
position
that
it's
ownership
only
in
the
most
nominal
sense,
bare
legal
title,
if
you
will.
all
the
true
indicia
of
ownership
we
don't
believe
go
to
the
buyer.
if
you
look
at
the
general
repurchase
agreement
in
this
case--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--the
internal
revenue
code
has
by
ruling
adopted
various
criteria,
or
it
looks
at
characteristics
that
can...
are
used
to
determine
whether
secured
loan
characterization
is
appropriate
to
repurchase
agreements
involving
state
and
local
obligations.
those
are
referred
to
in
our
brief.
economic
substance
is
important,
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
tax
matter,
and
that
is
the
general
principle
that's
been
long
recognized.
in
the
context
here,
we
think
analyzing
economic
substance
as
a
standard
is
appropriate.
now,
that
may
lead
to
different
results
if
you
have
different
characteristics
in
other
repos,
but
we're
dealing
here
with
a
specific
type
of
repo
engaged
in
by
the
mutual
funds.
we
think
the
court
can
accept
the
economic
substance
principle,
lay
the
ground
rules,
and
that
will
allow
parties
to--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--yes.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
but
if
parties
outside--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--because
of
the
fact
that
repos
can
differ
so
much
in
nature,
i
think
we'd
be
hardpressed
to
ask
for
anything
else.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
the
revenue
ruling
at
issue
simply
spoke
in
terms
of
repos
being
deemed
secured
lendings.
it
did
not
establish
specific
criteria
for
repos
themselves.
what
rule
may
be
adopted
as
a
result
of
a
decision
would
obviously
depend
on
that
decision.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
in
terms
of
the
treatment,
it
seems
that
most
states
tax
this
income.
that's
the
general
consensus
you
derive
from
looking
at
the
brief
of
the
amicus
state
and
local
legal
center,
as
well
as
investment
company
institute.
as
to
how
they
do
it,
whether
it's
by
judicial
decision,
whether
they
do
it
by
administrative
ruling,
there
is
even
some
inconsistency
with
some
states
saying
that
they
can
tax
all
dividends
from
mutual
fund
shareholders.
we
haven't
attempted
to
do
that.
we're
only
looking
at
that
portion
which
is
derived
from
repurchase
agreements.
so
i
don't
know
that
other
states
have
adopted
exactly
the
same
test,
but
i
think
they're
all
urging
the
court,
the
amicus
states,
to
look
at
economic
substance
as
the
test
to
be
applied.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
that
is
correct.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
that
is
correct.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
that
is
correct.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
yes.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
again,
based
on
my
understanding
of
the
statute,
that
that
would
be
the
application,
assuming
it
was
a
nebraska--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--yes.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
i
don't
know
that
i
can
say
that,
i
guess,
but
i'm...
my
understanding--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--no
more
so
than
does
any
state
statute
which
has
an
addback
like
nebraska's
if
this
were
a
direct
borrowing
to
obtain
the
obligation.
in
other
words,
that
would
require
a
reading
of
section
3124
that
we
think
is
well
beyond
what
is...
is
required
by
first
national
bank
of
atlanta.
the
pro
rata
deduction--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--only
in
an
economic
sense,
is
my
answer
to
that,
and
it's
not
constitutionally
required,
and
the
statute
doesn't
require
that
the
exemption
be
handled
any
differently.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
yes.
that
is
in
substance
what
it
is.
that's
how
it's--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--well--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--the
key,
though,
is
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
exemption
statute
itself,
what
is
a
state
precluded
from
doing?
it
may
not
tax...
impose
a
tax
on
a
federal
obligation,
or
interest
on
a
federal
obligation,
that
considers
that
in
its
computation.
our--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--in
an
economic--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--even
if
the
transaction
were
characterized
as
a
sale
and
repurchase,
if
the
funds
were
the
actual
owner,
then
that
raises
another
question.
then
is
not,
if
they
are
the
owner
and
they
are
reselling
the
obligation,
wouldn't
that
in
essence
be
gain
on
sale,
which
the
states
have,
i
think,
the
authority
to
tax
a
gain
on
sale
of
a
federal
obligation.
so
if
they
are...
it's
clear
from
the
agreements
that
what
they're
bargaining
for
is
not
the
interest
from
the
federal
government,
and
if
it
is
a
real
sale,
then
in
actuality
what
they
are
getting
is
gain
on
sale
of
that
federal
obligation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
again,
may
it
please
the
court--
it
seems
that
the
issue
in
respondent's
argument
is
focused
on
the
validity
of
the
addback
provision
which
nebraska
and
apparently
other
states
have.
we
believe
the
validity
of
the
addback
provision
was
established
by
the
court's
decision
in
first
national
bank
of
atlanta
v.
bartow
county,
and
if
that
is
the
only
argument
that
they
have
to
present,
we
think
that
the
court
can
certainly
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
of
course,
that's
largely
a
policy
question.
our
department
of
revenue
simply,
in
looking
at
the
cases,
i
suppose,
from
the
other
states,
saw
that
the
trend
was
to
allow
the
passthrough
of
interest
income
earned
by
direct
ownership
of
federal
obligations.
we
have
not
raised
the
issue,
but
i
assume
it's
based
on
the
trend
in
those
decisions,
but,
of
course,
our
position
isn't
binding
on
what
other
states
may
attempt.
there's
been
no
decision,
obviously,
by
this
court
on
that
question.
