m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it,
mr.
boyle,
rule
9(a)
mitigates
that
argument
somewhat
in
that
a
petition
can
be
dismissed
if
there's
been
lack
of
diligence
in
filing...
if
the
state...
at
least
if
the
state
can
show
prejudice,
i
believe,
under
that
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
why
that
would
happen.
if
he's...
let's
assume
that
in
this
case
the
marijuana
conviction
was
set
aside.
why
wouldn't
he
just
be
automatically
held
under
any
sensible
procedure
for
the
next
consecutive
sentence,
or
am
i
missing
something?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
i
see.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
not
contending
that
he
lacked
diligence
in
filing
this
petition,
are
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
