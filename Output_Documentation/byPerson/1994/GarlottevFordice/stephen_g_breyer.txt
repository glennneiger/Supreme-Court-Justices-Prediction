justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
you
think
that
there
is
a
way...
suppose
you
thought...
i'm
just
trying
this
one.
i
don't
know
your
reaction,
but
suppose
you
thought
that
peyton
and
these
other
cases
means
yes,
these
sentences
are
all
smushed
together
somehow,
so
is
there
still
a
difference
between
the
period
of
time
where
the
two
sentences
combined
means
that
he
has
to
be
confined...
in
this
case
that's
10
years
and
10
months...
and
then
the
period
of
time
after
that.
in
other
words,
suppose
10
years
and
10
months
runs--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
it
will,
and
then
that
day
comes,
and
then
he
isn't
released.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
now,
what
i
wonder
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--after
that
day
comes
and
goes,
then
if
he
wanted
to
challenge
that
first
sentence,
intuitively
that
seems
much
more
like
the
case
where
a
person's
been
out
for
awhile,
and
at
worst
what
happens
is
that
that
earlier
sentence
is
sort
of
taken
into
account
as
an
aggravating
factor
in
his
life
that
stops
parole,
whereas
before
that
10
years
and
10
months
runs,
it
seems
much
more
like
that
that
earlier
sentence
is
having
an
active
effect
at
forcing
him
to
be
confined
for
an
additional
10
months.
now,
i
don't
know
if
there
is
a
way
conceptually
of
taking
that
into
account
or
not.
that's
what
i'm...
i'm
wondering
what
your
view
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
yes,
i
know
that's
his
theory.
that's
why
i
thought--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
why
i
wanted
to
know
what
you
thought.
what
do
you
think
about
that?
i
mean,
is
there
some
distinction
possible
there,
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes,
but
i
mean,
if
you
lost
on
your
basics
theory
you'd
still
prefer
that
he
lose
his
right
to
challenge
the
initial
conviction
once
the
10
years
and
10
months
comes
to
pass.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
i
wondered
if
there...
if
you've
thought
of...
you
might...
you
probably
haven't
thought
about
it.
i
haven't
thought
it
through,
but
if
there
is
some
way
conceptually
that
that
would
work.
i
mean,
i
see
an
intuitive
difference,
and
i'm
not
sure
if
it
works
out
in
the
context
of
the
cases.
