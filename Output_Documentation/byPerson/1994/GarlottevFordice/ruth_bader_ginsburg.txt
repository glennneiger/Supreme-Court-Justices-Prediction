was
there
any
rhyme
or
reason
to
the
sentence
order,
mr.
boyle?
i
think
the
prosecutor
said
he
was
indifferent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
reason
the
judge
might
put
the
longer
sentence
first
and
the
shorter
sentence
second,
or
the
other
way
around,
as
in
this
case,
the
shorter
one
first
and
the
longer
one
second?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
he
say
thanks
but
no
thanks
to
the
good
time
because
i
want
to
challenge
the
sentence.
if
i
don't
get
the
good
time,
my
time...
i'll
still
be
under
the
first
sentence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
rhyme
or
reason
to
do
the
order
of
these
sentences?
the
prosecutor
was
indifferent,
and
peyton
we
have
an
example
of
the
shorter
sentence
second.
in
this
one,
the
shorter
sentence
is
first.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
he
has
no
reason
to
challenge
those
life
sentences,
and
his
reason
is
only
to
challenge
the
marijuana
sentence,
as
to
which
you're
not
making
any
claim
of
lack
of
diligence.
the
problem
was,
he
had
to
exhaust
his
state
remedy.
that's
why
he
didn't
get
to
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
no
lack
of
diligence.
you
were
making
an
argument
that
this
is
an
example
of
lack
of
diligence
because
he
still
hasn't
challenged
his
murder
convictions
on--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
meaning
of
the
words
“in
custody”
as
those
words
are
used
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute.
a
prisoner,
who
wants
to
attack
a
state
conviction
as
unconstitutional,
may
do
so
in
federal
court
to
a
habeas
corpus
petition
only
if
he
is
still
in
custody
under
the
conviction.
the
petitioner
here
harvey
garlotte,
plead
guilty
in
a
mississippi
state
court
in
1985
to
a
charge
of
marijuana
possession,
and
two
murder
charges.
sentences
were
imposed
in
this
order.
first,
a
three
year
term
for
the
marijuana
conviction.
second,
two
life
terms
to
run
concurrently
on
the
murder
charges.
the
two
life
terms
were
consecutive
to
that
is
they
were
to
be
served
after
the
three
year
marijuana
term.
soon
after
these
sentences
were
imposed,
garlotte
commenced
attacks
on
the
marijuana
conviction
in
mississippi
state
courts.
when
his
claims
were
unsuccessful
at
the
state
level,
he
sought
federal
habeas
relief
again
attacking
the
marijuana
conviction.
by
that
time
however,
garlotte
had
completed
service
of
the
prison
period
set
for
the
marijuana
offence,
and
had
begun
serving
the
life
sentences.
the
state
of
mississippi
maintained
that
because
garlotte
has
served
at
the
prison
term
imposed
for
the
marijuana
conviction.
he
was
no
longer
in
custody
as
required
by
the
habeas
statue.
united
states
courts
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
agreed
with
the
state,
and
therefore
rejected
garlotte’s
habeas
petition.
we
hold
that
garlotte
was
in
custody
under
the
marijuana
conviction
when
he
found
his
federal
habeas
challenge.
accordingly,
we
reverse
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
to
define
in
custody,
we
rely
primarily
on
a
1968
decision
of
this
court
peyton
against
rowe.
that
case
involved
two
virginia
prisoners,
both
of
them
incarcerated
under
state
imposed
consecutive
sentences.
we
allow
the
prisoners
in
peyton
to
reply
for
federal
habeas
relief
from
sentences
they
had
not
yet
begun
to
serve.
we
said
in
peyton
that
for
purposes
of
the
“in
custody”
requirement,
we
review
consecutive
sentences
as
a
continuous
series
flowing
together
as
one
stream
and
not
as
totally
discrete
units.
the
statutory
words
in
custody
should
not
be
given
a
meaning
here
different
from
the
meaning
we
gave
those
words
in
peyton
simply
because
the
sentence
imposed
under
the
challenge
conviction
lies
in
the
past
rather
than
in
the
future.
justice
thomas
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
joins.
