well,
the
practical
effect
is,
if
the
marijuana
conviction
were
set
aside
the
petitioner
would
be
entitled
to
an
earlier
release
date
from
the
remaining
sentence,
i
gather.
justice

at
an
earlier
date--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
this
were
set
aside.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
the
challenge
to
the
marijuana
conviction
brought
during
the
period
of
time
when
the
petitioner
was
still
serving
a
sentence
on
the
marijuana
conviction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
that.
i'm
asking
whether
the...
his
challenge
to
the
marijuana
conviction
was
brought
at
a
time
when
he
was
still
serving
time
on
the
marijuana
conviction,
and
i
would
think
that
would
be
just
a
factual
thing,
yes
he
did,
or
no
he
didn't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when
he
first
challenged
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
regardless
of
the
reason,
what
happened
in
peyton
was
that
the
court
said
you
could
aggregate
the
sentences
and
a
habeas
challenge
would
lie
immediately,
even
to
one
that
technically
hadn't
started
to
run
yet.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
you
apply
that
principle
here,
then
there
is
jurisdiction
even
though
the
marijuana
conviction
sentence
has
expired
because
it
has
an
effect
on
the
length
of
time
the
prisoner
will
actually
serve
on
the
second
conviction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
were
reasons
given,
but
it
nonetheless
adopted
a
principle
of
aggregating
them
and
letting
the
habeas
challenge
be
brought.
