justice
david
h.
souter
but
do
you
take
the
position
that
peyton
does
not
control?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
are
saying
we
cannot
rule
against
you
without
overruling
peyton.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
peyton
was
construing
a
statute,
and
it
was
construing
the
word
"custody"
in
the
statute,
and
it
said
that
term
is
going
to
be
construed
on
the
theory
of
in
for
one
sentence,
in
for
all,
and
i
don't
see
how
that
construction
can
vary
depending
on
whether
we
are
looking
forward
or
whether
we
are
looking
backward.
this
isn't
a
question
of
just
common
law
policymaking
that
the
court
was
going
through
here.
it
was
going
through
statutory
construction,
and
i
don't
know
why
we
are
not
bound
by
it
under
the
normal
rules
of
stare
decisis.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying,
therefore,
or
you're
implying
that
the
same
word
in
the
same
statute
has
radically
different
meanings,
depending
on
whether
we
look
forward
or
whether
we
look
back?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
a
tough
row
to
hoe.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
you
explain
how
we
have
that
freedom?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're...
it's
fine
to
say
that,
but
you're
in
effect
rejecting
the
premise
of
the
question.
the
question's
premise
is,
we've
already
construed
custody
to
say,
all
consecutive
sentences
are
continuous,
to
be
regarded
as
one
for
purposes
of
what
is
custody
under
this
statute.
how
do
we
have
an
option
to
say,
in
fact,
we
were
wrong,
that
only
applies
when
we
are
looking
forward?
that
isn't
what
we
held,
and
i
don't
see
how,
in
principle,
we
could
redefine
the
identical
term
in
the
two
circumstances.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
you
see--
justice
david
h.
souter
--not
broadly,
but
the
court
did
not
say,
for
purposes
of
looking
forward
statutes
are
or
sentences
are
continuous.
it
said,
sentences
are
continuous,
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
therefore
we
can
look
forward.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
went
through...
i
just
skimmed
peyton
again.
i
mean,
peyton
has
sort
of
two
parts,
in
a
way.
it
has
a
policy
and
it
has
a...
well,
three
parts,
i
guess.
it
has
a
historical
analysis,
then
it
has
a
kind
of
policy
analysis
of
considerations,
and
then,
in
its
concluding
section,
it
draws
the
lesson
that
mr.
boyle
relies
upon
and,
perfectly
true,
it
says
in
the
policy
analysis
we're
worried
about
the
value
or
lack
of
value
in
looking
ahead,
but
when
it
gets
to
construe
the
statute
it
says,
custody
means
a
continuity
of
sentences,
and
it...
i
don't...
you...
i
don't
see
how
we
could
hold
your
way
without
saying
that
the
term
is
going
to
have
different
meanings
depending
on
whether
we
look
forward
or
look
back.
and
there
may
be
policy
reasons
for
wishing
it
did,
and
they
are
in
part
addressed
by
the
point
that
justice
kennedy
made,
but
regardless
of
policy
reasons
for
wishing
it
could,
we're
still
faced
with
the
fact
that
we've
only
got
one
word
in
one
statute,
and
i
don't
see
how
it
can
have
two
meanings.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
does
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
does,
but
your
argument
suggests
that
there
is
somehow
an
inducement
for
their
delay,
and
i
don't
see
that,
because
i
don't
see
why
the
inducement
is
not
likely
to
work
against
them.
i
would
suppose
the
inducement
would
be,
if
they
really
have
a
claim,
to
get
it
out
and
get
it
litigated.
if
they
don't
have
a
claim,
they're
not
going
to
be
any
better
off
40
years
later.
