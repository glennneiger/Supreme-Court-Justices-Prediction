justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
you've
been
very
careful
each
time
to
say
he's
eligible
for
parole
earlier
if
the
shorter
sentence
is
set
aside.
is
it
clear...
what
is
missouri...
mississippi
law
on
the
following
hypothesis.
the...
say
there's
no
bail
or
anything
pending
appeal.
the
person
starts
serving
a
sentence
immediately,
and
the
short
sentence
is
fully
served
before
the
appeal
process
is
over,
and
the
appellate
court
sets
aside
the
short
sentence
and
leaves
in
place
the
long
sentence.
does
he
get
an
earliest
release
date
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
not
just
eligibility
for
parole.
he
would
in
fact
get
the
earlier--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
as
a
matter
of
mississippi
law,
what
is
the
condition
that
must
be
met
in
order
to
file
a
collateral
attack
in
mississippi?
is
custody
the
standard
there,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
that
mean
that
as
a
matter
of
mississippi
law
he
would
be
too
late
to
attack
his
sentence,
or
has
that
not
been
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
3-year
statute
or
limitations
regardless
of
the
length
of
the
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
were
within
one
of
the
exceptions,
would
you
be
able
to
file
after
the
3
years...
after
the
short
sentence
had
expired?
in
other
words,
do
you
have
a
rule
in
mississippi
such
as
the
one
you're
contending
should
apply
in
federal
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
too
late
in
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
white,
have
you
finished
your
argument,
because
i
wanted
to
ask
you
one
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
directly
related
to
the
case.
i'm
just
curious,
because
you've
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
in
these
cases,
do
you
think
the
general
exhaustion
rule
is
a
sound
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that
outweighs
the
delay
that
it
causes,
is
the
question
that
runs
through
my
mind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you
very
much.
