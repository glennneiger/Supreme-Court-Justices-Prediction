mr.
brian
d.
boyle
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
harvey
garlotte
has
been
confined
in
mississippi
since
1985
under
a
consecutive
term
of
3
years
imprisonment
and
two
follow
on
concurrent
life
terms.
in
this
habeas
action,
mr.
garlotte
challenges
the
conviction
that
resulted
in
the
3-year
term,
and
the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
mississippi's
treatment
of
all
of
mr.
garlotte's
consecutive
sentences
as
a
single,
essentially
general
sentence
for
penalogical
purposes
means
that
mr.
garlotte
was
in
custody
for
purposes
of
habeas
corpus
when
he
began
this
action
in
1989.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
well,
we
argue,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
mississippi
essentially
aggregates,
or
treats
as
unitary,
a
series
of
consecutive
sentences,
and
by
that
i
mean
the
prisoner
is
assigned
a
single
date
of
parole
eligibility,
which
turns
on
the
total
period
of
confinement,
not
on
the
individual
sentences,
the
order
in
which
those
sentences
have
been
prescribed
is
irrelevant
to
the
prisoner's
release
date,
and
such
penalogical
functions
as
calculating
earned
time,
calculating
good
time,
those
functions
are
made
on
the
basis
of
the
total
term
of
confinement,
so
i
analogize
consecutive
sentences
to
a
general
sentence
for
multiple
convictions.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
a
general
sentence--
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
--your
honor,
a
general
sentence
at
common
law
was
a
single
term
of
confinement
for
convictions
upon
multiple
counts.
it
raised
any--
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
that's
basically
our
point,
your
honor,
that
for
all
intents
and
purposes
mississippi
treats
consecutive
sentences,
administers
them
as
a
general
sentence
in
which--
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
--that's
basically
correct,
your
honor.
he
would
be
entitled...
he
would
be
eligible
for
release
on
parole--
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
--at
an
earlier
date,
that's
correct.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
that's
correct.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
our
argument,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
garlotte
is
being
held
under
all
of
his
convictions,
including
the
marijuana--
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
--looking
at
the
marijuana
sentence
alone,
your
honor,
no,
he
was
not
marking
time
on
that
sentence.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
when
he
first
brought
his
federal
petition,
when
he
first
went
to
federal
court.
it's
a
matter
of
debate
in
terms
of
when
he
first
went
into
state
court
to
exhaust
his
state
remedies.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
that's
precisely
our
position,
that
it's
impossible
to
parse
the
consecutive
sentences
that
mr.
garlotte
is
serving
under,
and
indeed
inappropriate
to
do
so,
because
the
state
doesn't
do
so
for
any
penalogical
purposes.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
make
a
slightly
different
point.
i
think
the
question
whether
garlotte
is
marking
time
on
the
marijuana
sentence
is
somewhat
separate
from
the
question
whether
he's
being
held
under
the
marijuana
conviction,
and
as
i
answered
justice
o'connor's
question,
looking
at
the
marijuana
sentence
alone,
he
is
not...
he
was
not
marking
time
on
that
conviction--
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
--well,
the
state
insists
that
it
expired
at
that
point.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
looking
at
the
sentence
individually,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
but
you
have
a
different
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
based
on
peyton.
you're
saying
the
reason
the
sentences
were
amalgamated
in
peyton
in
order
to
be
able
to
"anticipate"
a
sentence
for
purposes
of
habeas
attack
was
to
satisfy
the
jurisdictional
requirement
that
he
be
in
custody.
well,
if
you
can
amalgamate
in
order
to
anticipate,
the
you've
got
to
follow
the
same
jurisdictional
rule
when
in
fact
you're
looking
backwards,
so
i
think
you're...
you
have
a
separate
argument
saying
you
can't
have
peyton
for
jurisdictional
purposes
and
not
allow
me
to
attack,
i.e.
on
the
basis
of
custody
for
jurisdictional
purposes,
and
that's
a
separate
argument,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
that's
an
argument
based
on
peyton,
and
you're
saying
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
the
principle
that
derives
from
peyton
is
that
a
prisoner
serving
consecutive
sentences
is
in
custody
under
any
one
of
those
sentences
for
the
balance
of
his
confinement.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
oh,
undoubtedly
there
were
practical
considerations
that
motivated
the
court
in
peyton,
and
those
you
described,
and
it
is
clear
that
the
rule
that
we
propose
would
permit
mr.
garlotte
to
challenge
his
marijuana
conviction
for
as
long
as
he
remains
in
iron
bar
confinement
in
mississippi,
just
as
it
would
permit
another
prisoner
serving
a
life
sentence
to
challenge
that
life
sentence
for
as
long
as
he
remains
confined.
but
the
practical
considerations
that
motivated
the
court
in
peyton
led
to
a
principle
in
the
case
that
obviously
spans
beyond
the
narrow
factual
circumstances
that
the
peyton
court
confronted,
and
the
principle
is
that
the
prisoner
serving
consecutive
sentence
is
for
all
intents
and
purposes
really
serving
a
general
sentence
on
multiple
convictions,
and
can
bring
the
petition
in
time.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
at
the
sentencing
hearing
the
prosecutor
expressed
total
indifference
to
the
order
in
which
garlotte
would
be
required
to
serve
his
sentences,
and
for
good
reason.
it
doesn't
matter
for
purposes
when
he
will...
for
purposes
of
the
most
important
event
for
the
state
and
the
prisoner,
which
is
when
he
might
be
released
into
the
community,
the
order
in
which
those
sentences
appear
in
the
commitment
order
makes
no
difference.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
no
reason
that
occurs
to
me,
except
perhaps...
and
we
don't
make
this
argument
at
all
here...
except
perhaps
to
foreclose
collateral
review
if
we're
wrong
here.
i
think
we've
canvassed
the
cases
pretty
carefully
in
mississippi,
and
there's
no...
appears
to
be
no
rhyme
or
reason
to
the
order
of
sentences
such
as
we
have
here,
a
short,
fixed
period
of
confinement
followed
by
a
consecutive
life
term.
in
many
cases,
you
find
the
life
sentences
first
to
be
followed
by
the
fixed
terms
of
imprisonment,
and
in
that
instance,
of
course,
the
prisoner
becomes
eligible
for
parole,
eligible
for
release
without
having
even
begun
serving
the
fixed
terms
of
imprisonment
that
follow
the
consecutive
sentences...
follow
the
life
terms,
so
i
think
that
provides
a
handy
illustration
of
how
consecutive
sentences
really
do
amount
to
a
general
sentence.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
my
understanding
of
mississippi
law
is
that
he
would.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
right.
one
of
the
other
features
of
consecutive
sentences
that
we
point
out
in
our
opening
brief
is
that
time
served,
or
time
marked
under
one
of
the
consecutive
sentences
is
really
only
provisionally
credited
against
that
sentence.
if
one
of
the
sentences
positioned
earlier
is
invalidated
for
any
reason,
subject...
or
pardoned,
the
later
consecutive
sentence
sort
of
slides
forward,
and
the
person
gets
full
credit,
and
that's
another
point
we
make
about...
or
another
basis
for
our
conclusion
that
consecutive
sentences
really
do
amount
to
a
single,
general
sentence
upon
multiple
convictions.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
i
think
it's
tough
luck,
and
for
this
reason.
i
don't
think
states
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
giving
a
prisoner
an
opportunity
to
bank
time
under
an
unconstitutional
conviction
they
can
apply
against
a
future
offense.
i've
described
mississippi
law,
and
how
mississippi's
position
on
the
custody
question
is
inconsistent
with
the
statutes
that
define
mr.
garlotte's
custody,
but
mississippi's
position
is
likewise
inconsistent
with
its
own
actions
in
administering
mr.
garlotte's
sentences,
and
profoundly
inconsistent.
on
the
one
hand,
we're
told
that
mr.
garlotte's
sentence
expired
and
was
supposedly
beyond
redetermination,
beyond
adjustment,
sometime
between
1988
and
1986.
it's
hard
to
tell.
it
depends
on
when
you
look
at
it.
but
in
1992,
pursuant
to
recently
enacted
legislation,
the
mississippi
department
of
corrections
credited
a
significant
amount
of
earned
time,
meritorious
earned
time
to
mr.
garlotte's
confinement.
the
net
result
was
that
his
marijuana
sentence
was
cut
in
half,
and
the
mississippi
department
of
corrections
credited
the
time
that
was
freed
up
against
the
life
sentences.
now,
i
don't
know
how
that
action
can
be
reconciled
with
mississippi's
position
here
that
the
sentence
is
over
and
done
with
and
beyond
adjustment.
the
critical
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
the
credits
that
were
awarded
in
1992
remain
reversible,
and
for
as
long
as
mr.
garlotte
is
in
iron
bar
confinement.
i
think
that
illustrates
how
the
marijuana
conviction
restrains
mr.
garlotte
throughout
the
aggregate
duration
of
his
confinement.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
the
mississippi
statutes
which
are
cited
in
the...
or
quoted
in
full
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
provide
for
the
computation
of
earned
time,
or
commutation
on
the
basis
of
the
total
period
of
confinement
when
a
prisoner
is
under
consecutive
sentences,
and
separate
provisions
of
mississippi
law
provide
for
forfeiture--
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
--that's
right,
your
honor,
for
as
long
as
he
remains
in
prison.
if
he
violates...
i
can't
remember
the
exact
words,
but
if
he
commits
a
serious
violation
of
prison
rules
20
years
from
now
the
state,
under
my
reading
of
the
mississippi
statutes,
can
withdraw
that
earned
time,
and
in
that
situation,
of
course,
he
will
be
deemed
to
have
begun
technically
serving
the
life
sentences
a
year-and-a-half
later.
now,
mississippi
contends
that
the
so-called
discharge
dates
of
each
consecutive
sentence
must
be,
even
though
they're
irrelevant
for
penalogical
purposes
in
mississippi,
they
have
to
be
treated
as
sacrosanct
by
federal
courts
in
confronting
a
habeas
challenge.
i
think
that
argument
is
the
one
that
is
foreclosed
by
peyton,
and
quite
clearly
so.
virginia
in
that
case
tried
to
block
a
prisoner
from
challenging
the
second
of
two
sentences...
i
think
they
were
30
and
20-year
sentences...
in
that
case
on
the
ground
that
he'd
only
been
in
prison
a
few
years
and
hadn't
yet
begun
to
serve
the
second
term.
observing
that
the
prisoner
in
that
case
had
a
single
parole
date
under
virginia
law,
the
court
held
that
he
was
for
all
practical
terms
serving
a
50-year
sentence
and
it
would
be
treated
as
such
for
habeas
purposes.
essentially,
what
the
court
held
is
that
the
sentence
under
which
a
prisoner
is
technically
marking
time
is...
that
question
whether
the
prisoner
is
marking
time
under
the
challenged
sentence
is
a
separate
one
from
whether
he
is
held
or
in
custody
under
the
conviction,
and
that's
amplified
by
some
of
the
court's
other
decisions,
hensley
v.
municipal
court,
estelle
v.
dorrough,
and
braden
v.
30th
judicial
district
court,
which
permit
a
prisoner
to
challenge
confinement
that
he
is
scheduled
to
serve
in
another
jurisdiction
before
that...
before
he's
begun
to
serve
that
confinement.
i
think
the
theory
is
that
in
that
situation
the
prisoner
is
not
only
being
held
by
the
first
jurisdiction
to
discharge
the
first
sentence,
but
he's
also
being
held
in
anticipation
of
serving
another
sentence.
mississippi
relies
a
great
deal
on
maleng
v.
cook,
and
submits
that
the
issue
has
already
really
been
decided
in
maleng,
but
all
maleng
held
was
that
a
sentence
or
a
conviction
that
no
longer
poses
any
present
restraints
on
a
prisoner
does
not
become
a
source
of
custody
for
purposes
of
federal
habeas
corpus
simply
because
it's
been
used
to
enhance
a
sentence
upon
a
subsequent
conviction.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
i
think
that's
fair,
your
honor.
the
actual
facts
of
peyton
were
such
that
the
prisoner
had
not
yet
begun
to
serve
the
sentence
he
was
challenging.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
that's
correct,
but
the
sentence
at
issue
in
that
case
was
not
imposed
consecutively.
there
was
no
basis
to
conclude
that
the
earlier
sentence
that
had
been
used,
or
earlier
conviction
that
had
been
used
to
enhance
the
subsequent
sentence
was
somehow
aggregated
or
combined
into
a
single
sentence
by
the
jurisdiction
for
purposes
of
such
things
as
parole
eligibility,
commutation,
and
so
forth.
the
only
continuing
influence
of
that
prior
conviction,
in
fact,
was
the
prisoner's
status
as
a
felon,
which
was
obviously
influential
to
the
sentencing
judge
in
the
subsequent
conviction
in
seeing
that
the
prisoner
is
a
danger
and
thus
enhancing
the
sentence.
i
think
the
principle
to
be
derived
from
maleng
is
that
in
that
situation
where
a
prior
fully
expired
conviction
is
used
to
enhance
a
sentence
for
a
subsequent
offense,
that
the
source
of
the
prisoner's
injury
and
the
proper
object
of
his
habeas
petition
is
that
subsequent
sentence,
that
subsequent
conviction,
and
that's
in
fact
what
the
court
held
in
that
case.
the
court
found
jurisdiction
over
the
claims
in
the
case,
but
albeit
through
the
subsequent
offense
and
subsequent
sentence.
now--
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
--i
agree
that,
your
honor,
that
concerns
about
delay
are
legitimate
concerns.
i
don't
think
they're
present
here.
the
state
doesn't
argue
that
mr.
garlotte
delayed
inexcusably
his
habeas
petition
here,
and
i
think
our
position
is
that
the
jurisdictional
scope
of
the
statute,
which
congress
delimited
in
terms
of
confinement,
in
terms
of
custody
such
that
a
prisoner
serving
a
life
sentence
could
conceivably
wait
40
years
before
bringing
a
habeas
challenge--
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and
so
i
would
regard
the
jurisdictional
question
as
ill-suited
to...
or
the
jurisdictional
inquiry
as
ill-suited
to
try
to
deal
with
concerns
about
delay.
it
seems
rule
9(a)
is
a
perfectly
fitted
remedy.
i'd
make
another
point,
and
that
is
where
you
have
a
prisoner
serving
a
continuous
period
of
confinement
under
multiple
convictions
there
is...
there's
no
real
incentive
for
a
prisoner
to
delay
bringing
his
habeas
claims.
each
day
that
passes
is
potentially
another
day
in
unconstitutional
confinement.
each
day
that--
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
--i
don't
contend
that
practical
considerations
are
irrelevant
here.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
i
think,
justice
souter,
the
principle
of
peyton
does
control
this
case,
the
principle
being
that
a
prisoner
serving
consecutive
sentences
is
in
custody
under
each
conviction
supporting
those
sentences
throughout
the
aggregate
duration
of
the
confinement.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
without
overruling
or
modifying
its
principle.
i
think
that's
right.
there
are
practical
considerations
to
point
out
in
mississippi's
position
as
well.
i'll
mention
a
few
of
them.
the
first
is
that
the
rule
sought
by
mississippi
would
make
the
availability
of
redress
for
constitutional
claims
turn
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
on
the
order
in
which
those
sentences
are
positioned
in
the
commitment
order,
and
for
no
real
reason,
when
the
state
concedes
that
the
order
in
which
they
are
to
be
served
makes
no
difference
for
important
penalogical
events.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
our
threshold
position,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
each
of
the
convictions
supporting
the
consecutive
sentences
poses
a
present
restraint
throughout
the
duration
of
confinement,
and
in
light
of
that
i
think
that
permitting
the
availability
of
redress
to
turn
on
the
order
in
which
the
sentences
appear
in
the
commitment
order
when
that
order
makes
no
difference
for
purposes
of...
for
penalogical
purposes
in
mississippi
would,
indeed,
be
arbitrary.
another
effect
of
the
rule
sought
by
mississippi
is
that
it
would
place
prisoners'
constitutional
claims
at
the
mercy
of
the
exhaustion
process.
a
prisoner
who
moved
diligently
to
exhaust
his
state
remedies
and
that
exhaustion
process
for
whatever
reason
did
not
conclude
prior
to
the
technical
expiration
or
the
so-called
discharge
date
of
the
first
consecutive
sentence
would
be
foreclosed
from
habeas
relief.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
here,
of
course--
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
--but
the
difference
here,
your
honor,
is
that
the
marijuana
conviction
will
pose
restraint
on
mr.
garlotte,
will
have
custodial,
real
custodial
effects
on
mr.
garlotte
throughout
the
time
he
is
confined
in
mississippi,
an
iron
bar
confinement,
and
in
that
circumstance,
i
think
it's
unfair
to
leave
those...
the
claims
he
may
have
against
that
conviction
at
the
mercy
of
the
exhaustion
process.
the
final
point,
from
a
practical
perspective,
is
that
it
would...
the
rule
sought
by
mississippi
would
put
courts
in
the
sometimes
confounding
position
of
trying
to
figure
out...
trying
to
parse
consecutive
sentences
and
trying
to
figure
out
when
confinement
ends
under
one
and
begins
under
another.
this
case
is
a
perfect
example,
where
the
technical
discharge
date
of
mr.
garlotte's
marijuana
conviction
swung
wildly
from
'88
to
'86.
it
may
swing
back
again.
there's
no
reason
to
take
on
that
burden
when
the
state
doesn't
do
so
for
purposes
of
administering
its
penal
system
and
when
nothing
of
importance
penalogically
turns
on
those
technical
discharge
dates.
it
would
be--
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
--there
may
be
some,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
there
may...
those
variations
may
have
significance
for
purposes
of
the
federal
question,
but
my
understanding
of
mississippi's
rules
is
that
these
are
the
customary
rules
under
which
consecutive
sentences
are
administered,
for
good
reason.
the
state
doesn't
want
to
risk
having
a
prisoner
paroled
on
the
first
conviction
and
sentence
before
he
begins
to
serve
another
conviction
and
sentence.
the
state
doesn't
want
to
put
itself
in
the
position
of
having
a
prisoner
released
because
the
first
sentence
is
invalidated
or
pardoned
pending
the
service
of
other
sentences.
it
wants
a
continuous
period
of
confinement,
and
so
i
think
the--
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
--under
consecutive
sentences
he
would,
justice
kennedy,
and
that's
because
the
commencement
date
for
each
subsequent
consecutive
sentence
is
a
function
of
the
termination
date
of
the
prior.
if
the
sentences
were
truly
separate,
if
they
were...
if
they
each
had
separate,
fixed
beginning
and
end
dates,
you
could
imagine
a
situation
in
which
a
prisoner
would
be
eligible
for
parole
and
might
get
parole,
be
in
the
community,
before
he
was
called
to
serve
the
subsequent
sentences.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
so
the
state
sees
real
advantages
in
aggregating,
amalgamating
consecutive
sentences
and
treating
them
as
a
general
sentence,
and
our
submission
is
that,
given
that
election,
mississippi
has
to
accept
the
consequences
that
turn
on
long
periods
of
confinement.
the
state
i
don't
think
should
be
permitted
to
resurrect
artificial
discharge
dates
as
a
means
of
closing
habeas
review
when
those
discharge
dates
have
absolutely
no
meaning
under
the
penal
system.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
brian
d.
boyle
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
make
just
a
couple
of
points.
first,
on
the
question
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
parse
consecutive
sentences
according
to
whether
the
prisoner
is
marking
time
in
those
sentences,
another
thought
occurred
to
me,
sitting
down,
and
this
is
amplified
in
the
briefs.
in
mississippi,
as
i
think
in
most
states,
the
sentences
are
really
discharged
in
dovetail
fashion,
so
that
when
mr.
garlotte's
initial
parole
eligibility
comes
around
in
march
1996,
he
will
still
have
the
balance
of
his
life
terms
to
serve
as
well
as
a
parole
term
on
the
marijuana
conviction.
this
is
not
idle
imagination,
either.
one
of
the
cases
we
cite,
williams
v.
puckett,
describes
a
situation
where
a
prisoner
who
was
on
probation
committed
a
subsequent
offense,
was
sentenced
upon
that
offense,
and
had
his
probation
revoked.
the
order
in
which
the
department
of
corrections
considered
those
sentences
satisfied
was
first
the
mandatory
term
on
the
revoked
probation,
second,
the
minimum
parole
term
on...
actually,
it
was
a
nonparolable
offense,
armed
robbery,
that
entire
10-year
term
next,
and
finally
the
parole
term
on
the
original
offense,
so
it's...
they
really
are
discharged
in
dovetail
fashion.
then
also,
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
question,
which
is
an
intriguing
one,
i
think
this
case,
of
course,
illustrates
the
direct
restraint
that
is
posed
by
garlotte's
marijuana
conviction,
but
i
think
even
beyond
the
date
of
initial
parole
eligibility,
like
in
the
year
15
or
20,
the
sentences
still
are
treated
as
a
general
sentence.
the
earned
time
that
he
has
on
his
marijuana
conviction
is
carried
forward
and
can
be
forfeited
at
any
point,
and
if
the
marijuana
conviction
is
invalidated,
he
can
get
credit
for
that
service
on
his
life
sentences,
even
at
that
point.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
