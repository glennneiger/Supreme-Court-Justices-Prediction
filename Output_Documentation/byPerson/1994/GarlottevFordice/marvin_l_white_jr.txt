mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
basic
arguments
here,
and
the
argument
that
we
are
looking
at
is
the
extension
of
peyton
v.
rowe
to
this
particular
situation.
peyton
was
decided
to
take
care
of
a
specific
situation,
the
overruling
of
mcnally
v.
hill,
which
had
set
up
a
rule
of
prematurity
in
the
bringing
of
a
habeas
petition
for
sentences
to
be
served
in
the
future.
the
circuits
that
have
decided
contrary
to
the
fifth
circuit
have
grasped
on
the
language
found
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion
without
any
analysis
of
the
reason
for
peyton
to
be
decided.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
but
that
was
not
the
basis
of
peyton.
peyton
was
to--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--but
the
court
repeatedly
said,
for
sentences
to
be
served
in
the
future,
not
in
the
past.
i
mean,
we
have
a
different
factual
situation--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
we
contend
that
it's
a
totally
different
fact
situation,
and
that
it
is...
the
basis--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--absolutely.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
if
the
sentence
has
already
been
served,
he
is
not
in
custody
on
that
sentence
any
longer.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
i
don't...
and
of
course
i
don't
read
peyton
that
broadly,
as
being
the
answer
to
the
whole
question.
i
mean,
it...
in
the
last--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--paragraph,
i
think--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--in
that
last
paragraph.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
in
the
last
paragraph.
every
other
time
it
mentions
about,
in
the
future.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
in
the
future,
in
the
future.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
the
policy
considerations
certainly
weigh
heavily
in
this
case,
because
once
this
court
says
that
it
can
retroactively
do
so,
somebody
that
has
been,
even
with
justice
kennedy's
concern,
or
i
mean,
comment
about
rule
9,
this
does
not
mean
that
these
people
can't
raise
these
claims
that
are
40
years
old.
you
know,
even...
the
case--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--the
question
that's--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
this
very
petitioner
belies
this
whole
argument
about
not
delay,
of
the
lack
of
delay
that
they
make,
saying
that
everybody's
going
to
rush
in
and
file
their
habeas
as
quick
as
they
can.
his
state
remedies
were
exhausted
on
two
consecutive
murder
convictions
that
he's
serving
now
in
1992.
he
has
yet
to
file
a
habeas
claim
on
those
cases.
this
is
not
something
that
we
don't
see
every
day
in
dealing
with
habeas
cases.
they
wait
10,
15
years,
and
all
of
a
sudden--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--no.
he
filed
this--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--but
he
had
already...
his
sentence
had
expired
in
this
case
and,
of
course,
they
say...
the
petitioner
is
arguing
that
aggregate
sentences
don't
make
any
difference
under
mississippi
law,
that
they're
all
amalgamated.
well,
they're
not.
we
only
have
to
look
at
page
54
of
the
joint
appendix
to
see.
why,
if
they
didn't
make
any
difference,
why
would
the
state
of
mississippi
or
the
department
of
corrections
produce
something
there
that
has
a
parole
eligibility
date
and
a
discharge
date
on
it
for
each
sentence?
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
not
under
coffey
v.
lavallee.
i
mean,
if
he
filed
it
while
he
was
in
custody
he's...
then
it
continues.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
is
later--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--restored?
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
oh,
and
it--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--and
it's
later
taken
away,
is
what
we're
saying.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
what
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no,
and--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--i
was
not
saying
no
to
your
question,
there.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
retroactively
we
don't
take
away
good
time
as
a
matter
of
policy.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
of
course,
there's
been
no--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--there's
been
no
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
case
to
bring
out
the...
these
ifs,
ands,
and
buts
in
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
in
the
application
there,
but
that
doesn't
happen,
you
know.
the
hundred
and...
the
time
that
he
has,
good
time
on
this,
will
not
be
taken
away
from
him.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
under
the
statute,
but
the
practice
and
procedures
right
now
that
are
in
effect
and
every
decision
of
our
supreme
court
has
said
that
any
benefit,
and
that's
why
it's
been
refigured,
is
that
the
benefit
goes
to
the--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
our
supreme
court
has
held
that
they're
not
unitary,
though.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
the
point
being
that
if
it,
at
some
later
point
it
did,
i
think
that
that...
you
know,
he
could
then
file.
it
could
be
timely.
but
at
the
time,
if
we
have
a
situation
where
this
is
not...
his
sentence
has
expired,
and
the...
just
as
the
discharge
date
in
this
case,
it
is
passed.
it
was
long
passed.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
it
is
credited...
well,
there
are
two
types.
there's
earned
good
time
and
meritorious
good
time.
they
are
two
different
animals.
they
get
confused.
now,
when
you
enter
in
on
a
sentence,
you
are
given
credit.
as
of
1992,
you're
given
credit
for
half
the
sentence
that
you
will
serve,
are
sentenced
to
serve,
and
at
any
time
during
your
sentence,
parts
of
that
can
be
taken
away.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
certainly.
in
this
particular
case,
if
you're
sentenced
to
a
life
sentence
you
don't
get
that...
there
are
exceptions
to
the
half-time
credit.
he
would
have
had
no
good
time
at
this
point
at
all.
he
would
not
be...
start
receiving
any
good
time
or
meritorious
earned
time
until
next
month,
or
june
of
this
year.
he
would...
you
know,
the
10
years
on
a
life
sentence
is
day
for
day,
without
any
reduction,
and
then
if
that...
when
that
parole
eligibility
date
is
reached
for
the
murder
conviction,
then
the
marijuana
conviction
would
start
to
be
served,
and
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
meritorious
earned
time
and
statutory
earned
time,
good
time.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
of
course,
he
timely
filed
it
here,
within
the
3-year...
we
have
a
3-year
statute
of
limitations
from
the
time
that
you
enter
a
guilty
plea
or
the
time
the
state
supreme
court
decides
it's
a
case
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
regardless.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
and
if
you
don't
bring
it
within
the
3
years,
it's...
you
know...
there
are
some
exceptions.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
mean,
there
are
exceptions
to
the
statute,
but
basically
we
have
a
3-year
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that...
i
mean,
if
he...
if
his
time
has
been
served,
he--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--he's
out
of
court.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
it's
too
late.
i
mean,
if
he
has
a
1-year
sentence,
you
know--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--and
he
serves
that
1-year
sentence,
he
can't
wait
2
more
years
to
attack
that...
collaterally
that
1-year
sentence.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
correct.
so
you
know--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--no,
not
yet.
and
of
course
in
this
particular
case
the
state
contends
that
we...
the
aggregate
sentences
do
make
a
difference,
as
i
was
explaining
there,
that
they...
the
order
in
which
they're
served,
and
in
this
particular
case,
under
petitioner's
theory,
that
he
would
be
able
basically
to
challenge
this
marijuana
conviction
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
because
in
mississippi
if
you're
sentenced
to
life,
you're
sentenced
to
life,
while
even
though
you
are
eligible
for
parole
in
10
years
and
may
get
out
of
jail,
under
mississippi
law
you
stay
under
a
sentence
of
life
for
the
rest
of
your
life,
and
therefore
he
would
have
been
able
to
challenge
this
marijuana
conviction
until
the
day
he
died.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
that's
true.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
they're...
the
thing
is
they're--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--they're
separate
convictions
for
separate
crimes.
you
know,
i
can
understand
that
a
life
sentence,
because
of
the
collateral
consequences
of
that
that
extend
throughout
the
life
of
being
basically,
i
think
technically
in
custody
for
the
rest
of
your
life,
whether
you're
behind
bars
or
not,
and
the
marijuana
conviction,
this
3-year
sentence,
you're
saying
because
i'm
in
for
this
one
i
get
a
free
ride
on
this
one,
and
whereas
if
a
person--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--or
we
put
it--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--right.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
right.
but
there
again
is
the
reason
we
do
that
is
because
we
want
that
speedy
resolution
of
that...
those
future
sentences,
so
we
don't
wait
for
40
years
or
20
years
or...
to
determine
these
cases,
and
that's
why...
i
mean,
that's
the
state's
position
here,
is
that
this
actually
turns
peyton
on
its
head,
because
it
invites
delay
and
not...
in
this
case,
and
you
know,
and
as
i
say,
in
this
very
case
is
an
example
of
that,
where
he
has
not
challenged
his
life
sentences
in
federal
court,
although
his
state
court
remedies
were
exhausted
on
may
2nd,
1992.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
that
happens
every
day,
that
people
exhausting
their--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--no,
that
was
not
the
argument
i
was
making.
the
argument
that
this
is...
shows
that
this
does
not
happen.
everybody
is
not
going
to
rush
in
and
file
their
habeas
petition
as
soon
as
possible
on
every
case,
and
the
parallel
case
with
this,
the
consecutive
sentence,
that's
not
happened
yet.
we're
not
saying
that
he
did
not,
as
soon
as
his...
well,
and
he
really
didn't
file
this.
he
filed
some
more
dilatory
state
pleadings
instead
of,
after
a
determination
of
the
state
post
conviction
petition
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
he
filed
a
second
one,
a
second
petition
in
state
court
alleging
the
very
same
issues
that
had
just
been
denied
instead
of
going
on
and
filing
his
federal
habeas.
i
mean,
that's...
it's
quite
often
done,
and
that's...
i
mean,
it's
not...
it
was
not
a
long
delay,
of
about
a
year,
maybe,
that
he
took
to
file
his
second
almost
identical
petition
in
state
court,
but
this...
you
know,
this
delayed
his
time,
and
this
was,
you
know,
his
choice
to
file
this
instead
of
going
into
federal
court,
because
he
exhausted
his
issues
in
that
first
petition--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--and
basically
reexhausted
them
in
the
second
petition
and
wasted
a
year's
time
filing
a
second
petition
in
state
court.
so
i
mean...
and
i
don't
even
know
if
the...
thinking
back
now,
i
don't
know
whether
the...
if
he
had
filed
within
that
first
time
he
would
have
still
been
within
his...
within
the
time
that
he
was
serving
the
marijuana
conviction,
but
that
did
happen.
i
mean,
this
happens
quite
often,
and
so
of
course
by
looking
at
it
this
way
i
think
we
turn
the
rule
in
peyton,
jurisdictional
rule
in
peyton
upside
down
when
we
say
that
you
can
go
back
and
challenge
sentences
that
are
fully
served,
even
though
there's
an
aggregate,
they
aggregate
in
the
future,
and
i
think
that
that's
certainly
the
way
it
should
be
viewed.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
as
it
will.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
he's
not
going
to
be.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
under
the
present--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--under...
petitioner's
theory
is
that
he
is
still,
will
be
on
parole
for
the
marijuana
sentence
at
the
same
time
he
is
on
parole
for
the
murders
if
and
when
he
ever
gets
out--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--and
that...
and
so
therefore
he
contends
that
that
collateral
consequence
of
being
on
parole
extends
whether
it's
10
or
15
or
20
years
before
mr.
garlotte
is
released
from
custody.
i
mean,
it's...
presently
the
set-off
is...
on
the
first
time
of
eligibility
for
parole
is
anywhere
from
3
to
5
years
right
now,
and--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--of
course,
our
argument
is
that
when
he
served--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--that
he
was
required
to
on
the
marijuana
conviction.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
and
we
have
a...
in
the
penitentiary
recs
we
have
an
earliest
parole
date
and
discharge
date.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
mean,
in
the
records
there
that
are
presented
to
the
inmate,
and
there
is
a
mistake
in
the
one
here,
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
footnote,
and
as
mr.
garlotte
points
out
to
the
court
in
his
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
9
and
10.
i
mean,
he
realizes
that
this
paper,
because
of
a
clerical
error,
is
in
error,
and
he's
actually
not
to
be
released
until
some
2
months
later
than
they
have
listed
there.
his
earliest
parole
date
is
not
listed
because
of
a
clerical
error
in
applying--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--oh,
absolutely.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes.
i
mean,
i
think
that
there's...
you
know,
there's
a
way
to
do
that.
of
course,
we'd
rather
have
the
whole
loaf
than
half
in
this
situation,
and
our
concern,
too,
is
that
the...
is
this
going
to
be
retroactively
applied
to
all
habeas
petitioners?
i
mean,
even
in
the
face
of
rule
9
it's
going
to
create...
could
create
a
tremendous
work
load
on
our
office
to
have
to
answer
all
these
things.
i
mean,
it's...
there's
one
thing
to
assert
jurisdiction
and
say
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction,
and
a
total...
a
totally
different
one
to
have
to
go
into
a
rule
9
situation
where
you
may
have
to
answer
the
total
thing
and
do
an
extensive
search
for
records
and
transcripts
and
things
like
this
that
may
be
very,
very
old
or
may
not
even
be
extant,
so
when
you
have
a
jurisdictional
bar
you
are
on
a
much
more
solid
ground
than
you
are
on
a
rule
9
bar
in
a
habeas
situation.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
is.
i
think
the
state
court
should
have
first
crack
at
it,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
you
know,
if...
in
our
federal
system,
yes,
i
think
it
outweighs
heavily
the
fact
that
the...
the
state
courts
are
catching
most
of
these
things,
and
they're
making
corrections
in
these
cases
and
vacating...
i
know
i,
my
court
has
changed,
in
the
17
years
i've
been
with
the
attorney
general's
office
has
changed,
where
it
was
a
perfunctory
denial
on
post
conviction
rules,
where
they're
seriously
considered,
and
many,
many
vacations
of
sentences
are...
you
know,
you
see
opinions
written
in
post
conviction
cases
where
you
didn't
used
to
see
that.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
there
were
many,
many
just
perfunctory
denials.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
thank
you.
