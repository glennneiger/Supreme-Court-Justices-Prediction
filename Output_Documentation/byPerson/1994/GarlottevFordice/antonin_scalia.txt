justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
your
position
is
that
he
was
serving
time
on
that,
because
you
can't
separate
the
time
on
that
from
the
time
on
the
rest.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
it
wasn't
principle
that
was
driving
peyton.
maybe
it
was
a
practicality
that
was
driving
peyton.
why
can't
you
say,
you
know,
the
law
makes
up
these
categories.
there's
no
such
thing
as,
you
know,
whether
it's
separate
or
amalgamated.
it's
simply
how
you
choose
to
look
at
it,
and
we
choose
to
look
at
it
as
amalgamated
in
peyton
in
order
that
you
didn't
have
to
wait
a
long
time
before
you
could
try
the
factual
matters
necessary
to
determine
the
earlier
incarceration,
but
in
this
case
that
practicality
cuts
in
precisely
the
opposite
direction,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--whereas
if
you
had
been
sentenced
to
that
separately
and
then
had
been
released,
and
then
committed
another
crime,
and
then
later
it
was
disclosed
that
you
didn't
actually
commit
the
earlier
crime,
that's
just
tough
luck.
it
wouldn't
be
credited
against
your
later
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
reversible?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
he
misbehaves
later,
the
earned
time
that
he
got
earlier
which
shorted
his
marijuana
conviction
will
be
put
back
on
the
marijuana--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
boyle,
i'm
concerned
about
the
practical
effects
of
what
you
urge
us
to
do
here.
that
is,
about
opening
up
to
challenge
very
stale,
very
stale
convictions
on
the
basis
of
evidence
that's,
i
mean,
20,
30,
40
years
old.
you're
saying
anyone
who's
serving
under
consecutive
sentences
can
now
go
back,
even
though
he
didn't
raise
the
challenge
at
the
time,
and
challenge
a
sentence,
2,
3
year
sentence
that
he
served
at
the
beginning
of
his
incarceration.
why
would
we
want
to
create
that
kind
of
problems
for
the
state
and
federal
courts
if,
as
you
say,
none
of
our
decisions
squarely
requires
us
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
that
happens
when
a
prisoner
hasn't
gotten
any
more
than
the
one
sentence
as
well.
i
mean,
if
he
ends
up
and
serves
his
3
years
and
it
serves
more
than
3
years
for
the
habeas
proceedings
to
be
completed,
it's
then
too
late
to
get
any
habeas
relief.
he
served
his
time,
it's
water
over
the
dam,
and
he
can't
challenge
that
conviction
any
more--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
if
it
has
continuing
future
effect,
at
least
for
purposes
of
recidivism
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
his
point
is
that
that's
just
a
paper
distinction.
what
would
happen
if
he
files
promptly
in
habeas
and
the
case
goes
all
the
way
through
state
courts
and
it
gets
up
to
our
court
3-1/2
years
later,
and
because
he's
acquired
a
half-year's
worth
of
good
time,
3-1/2
years
is
1
day
later
than
his
term
expired?
we'd
have
to
dismiss
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
moot,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
he
files
it
3-1/2
years
plus
1
day,
all
right?
then
he's
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
good
time
that
he's
earned
on
his
4-year
sentence
is
later
restored?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
still
serving
his
sentence.
he
has
this
4-year
sentence
plus
two
life
sentences
afterwards,
and
he's
gotten
a
half-year's
worth
of
good
time
credits
on
his
4-year
sentence,
so
he
files
his
habeas
action
during
that
period
that's
been
eliminated.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
virtue
of
his
good
time
credits.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
later
restored...
yes,
right.
i
mean,
the
good
time
credits
are--
justice
antonin
scalia
--later
eliminated.
does
it
retroactively--
justice
antonin
scalia
--become
a
timely
habeas
petition?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't?
why
not?
he's
served
4
years
on
it.
he
filed
it
within
the
4-year
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
just
policy.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
permits
it,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
permissible
for
that
to
happen,
isn't
it,
during
his
entire
time
of
incarceration?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
wrote
the
statute
differently
so
that
what
you
do
is
in
fact
what
you...
only
what
you
can
do,
then
we'd
have
a
different
case.
we
might
have
a
case
where
we
don't
have
one
unitary
sentence,
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
is
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
your
supreme
court
has
not
held
that
you
can't
take
away
good
time
credits
previously
given.
you
can.
you
just
tell
me
you
don't
do
it.
well,
the
fact
that
you
don't
do
it
doesn't
establish
what
kind
of
a
sentence
you
have.
it's
just
a
practice.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
troubled
by
the
fact
that
this
thing
can
be
filed
in
a
manner
that's
declared
to
be
untimely
and
then
retroactively
it
can
be
rendered
timely.
you
tell
me,
well,
you
don't
do
it.
well,
that's
nice
of
you,
but
it
doesn't
fit
with
the
theory
of
the
case,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
there's
no
statute
on
federal
habeas.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he's
able
to
challenge
his
life
sentence
conviction
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
wrong
with
being
able
to
challenge
this
other
one
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
if,
indeed,
the
two
are
sort
of
mish-mashed
together,
and
he's
serving
them
all
together--
justice
antonin
scalia
--each
having
an
effect
on
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
if
this
is
put
last.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
acknowledge
if
the
short
sentence
were
put
after
the
life
convictions
he
would
have
been
able
to
challenge
that
short
sentence
for
his
entire
life,
both
when
he
originally--
justice
antonin
scalia
--went
in
and
later
when
he
was
serving
it.
