chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-6790,
harvey
garlotte
v.
kirk
fordice.
mr.
boyle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
mississippi
treated
it
as
kind
of
a
generic
sense,
or
something
like
that?
i
didn't
catch
your
exact
phrasing,
but
i
gather
it's
something
of
importance
to
your
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
a
general
sentence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
simply
a
single
sentence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
didn't
have
here.
they
were
consecutive
sentences.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
missouri...
mississippi
treats
consecutive
sentences
much
like
a
general
sentence
for
multiple
con...
would
have
been
treated
at
common
law,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
surely
it's
not
literally
impossible
to
parse.
maybe
it's
inappropriate,
as
you
say,
but
one
can
tell
a
3-year
sentence
from
a
much
longer
sentence,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
had
expired
by
the
time
he--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
if
it
was
a
sentence
for
3
years,
one
can
tell
simply
by
looking
at
state
law,
i
suppose,
whether
or
not
it
had
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--do
you
think
it's
fair
to
say,
mr.
boyle,
that
neither
maleng
nor
peyton
cover
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
one
is
on
one
side
and
one
is
on
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
actual
facts
of
maleng
were
that
the
sentence
had
been
served
and
was
not
affecting
his
present
custody
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
court
in
peyton
used
the
jurisdictional
analysis
to
solve
a
practical
concern,
didn't
it?
that
suggests
that
the
jurisdictional
statute
may
not
be
regarded
as
like
the
twelve
tablets,
so
to
speak.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
you
would
have
a
hard
time
justifying
your
characterization
of
that
as
arbitrary,
saying
that
you
have
to
challenge
a
sentence
during
the
time
in
which
you're
serving
it.
now,
your
argument
may
be
that
the
statute
permits
that,
which
i
understand,
but
i
don't
think
it's...
i
think
it's
hard
to
say
it's
arbitrary
if
it
doesn't
permit
it,
to
simply
say,
you
had
a
sentence
for
3
years
imposed
upon
you
and
you
have
to
challenge
it
during
the
time
you're
serving
that
sentence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
this
rule
be
applied
in
states
other
than
mississippi?
i
mean,
i
suppose
you're
going
to
have
some
variations,
maybe
50
variations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
boyle.
mr.
white,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean,
if
you're
sentenced
to
10
years,
and
you
start
serving
your
sentence
on
march
1st,
1995,
you
are
said
to
have
a
5-year
sentence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
statute
of
limitations
is
a
necessary
but
not
a
sufficient
condition
for
the
habeas
petitioner
to
meet.
if...
even
though
he's
within
the
3-year
year
statute
of
limitations,
if
he's...
if
the...
his
sentence
has
already
expired,
he
can
no
longer
challenge
it
in
state
collateral--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
white.
mr.
boyle
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
boyle.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
94-6790
garlotte
against
fordice
would
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
