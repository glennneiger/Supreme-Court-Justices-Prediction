--mr.
bruton,
may
i
ask
if
ease
of
calculation
is
the
reason
why
you
are
not
urging,
as
central
states
is,
the
easterbrook
position
as
a
fallback?
that
is,
using
the
date
of
withdrawal
as
the
critical
date?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
choices
as
you
see
it
are
only
the
two
on
which
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
third
circuit
divided?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
if
the
withdrawal
occurred
on
that...
in
fact
occurred
on
that
very
last
day,
so
that
the
employer
had
made
all
the
contributions
for
that
year?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
it
say,
as
of
day
zero?
i
see
the
word
amortize,
but
i
don't
see
as
of
day
zero.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
amortize
says
spread
out,
but
it
doesn't
say,
starting
when.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
willard,
but
on
your
theory
there
would
always
be
some
gap
period.
it
may
be
short,
but
there'll
always
be
some
gap
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
there
is
a
gap...
either
way
you
move,
there's
going
to
be
one
side
or
the
other
disadvantaged,
so
why
don't
we
fall
back
on
the
beneficial
purpose
of
this
whole
plan,
this
whole
scheme?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
stressing
the
difference
between
ambiguity
and
simply
making
no
provision,
is
that
it?
you
said,
there's
no
room
for
construction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
willard,
do
you
know
why
judge
easterbrook
thought
the
case
that
created
the
split
really
didn't,
because
at
the
end
of
his
opinion
he
says
that
he
thought
it
doubtful
that
huber
actually
held
the
employer
must
pay
interest
from
the
valuation
date.
