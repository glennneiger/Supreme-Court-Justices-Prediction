justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that
schedule?
assume
a
case
in
which
the
annual
payment
that
it
has
to
make
is
100
percent
of
the
unfunded
liability.
one
payment
would
do
it,
and
the
payment
would
be
due
in
august
of
the
year,
and
it's
made
in
august
of
the
year.
they
paid
up
to
that
time
by
the
regular
payment.
would
you
say
they
also
had
to
pay
a
year's
interest
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
the
answer
to
the
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
your
answer
is
yes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
reason...
and
even
though
the
payment
is
made
in
full,
there's
been
no
arrearage,
it's
all
done
in
one
simple
payment,
nevertheless
you'd
charge
them
1
year's
interest
and
treat
that
as
the
amount
of
the
unfunded
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
january
1st
to
august
under
the
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though,
if
there
had
been
no
withdrawal,
say,
as,
you
know,
they
just
had
gradually
had
lesser
participation,
they
had
stayed
in
the
plan,
paid
that
amount,
that
discharged
their
liabilities
and
everybody
could
go
home,
they'd
still...
you
have
to
add
on
the
interest
because
they're
withdrawing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
one
isn't
any
easier
to
calculate
than
the
other.
i
mean,
your
schedule
is
no...
wouldn't
be
any
harder
to
calculate
if
you
just
didn't
put
the
interest
in
in
the
first
payment.
you'd
have
the
same--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
get
that
conclusion
out
of
the
word
"amortize"
in
this
section,
and
it's
puzzling
to
me
how
an
amortization
of
a
single
payment
for
the
full
amount
of
principal
due
would
contemplate
interest
being
paid
on
that
amount
if
you
pay
it
promptly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
paid
it
in
full
on
the
date
due,
it
would
fully
fund.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they'd
made
the
payments
up
to
august,
as
currently,
then
they
make
the
full
payment
of
the
unfunded
vested
liability
in
one
single
payment,
that
would
fully
fund
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
calculated
as
of
the
january
date,
but
the
employer
has
made
payments
from
january
to
august
under
the
old
schedule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
presumption
is
that
when
he
withdraws,
the
amount
calculated
as
of
the
first
of
the
year
will
remain
the
correct
amount,
without
further
fiddling
with
the
figures.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
that
the
word
"amortize"
mean
it's
that
amount
plus
the
year's
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
normally,
when
you
amortize
a
single
payment,
do
you
toss
interest
on
top
of
it?
have
you
ever...
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
that
ever
having
been
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
assumption
that
the
actuaries
used
realistic
interest
rates?
they
couldn't
use
a
7
percent
rate
for
one
year
when
the
interest
is
really
3
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
a
prepayment,
in
all
our
hypotheticals
we're
assuming
that
you
fix
the
unfunded
liability
as
of
december
31,
1980,
and
in
my
hypothesis
the
company
decides
to
pay
it
in
full
on
january
1st
of
the
following
year.
you're
saying
you
have
to
pay
the
full
amount,
plus
a
year's
interest--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
order
to
make
the
fund
whole,
but
that
more
than
makes
the
fund
whole,
the
plan
whole.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
such
a
case,
isn't
it,
because
they
made
contributions
through
august,
and
then
they
paid
interest
from
august
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
that
that
calculation
is
made
every
year
regardless
of
whether
anybody
withdraws
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
part
of
the
routine
accounting
in
front.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
willard,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
understanding
of
what
it
is
in
the
statute
that
imposes
any
interest
obligation
at
all?
the
reason
i
ask
is
that
this
is
kind
of
a
strange
amortization.
instead
of
taking
an
amount
and
then
figuring
out
how
long...
many
years
it
would
take
to
pay
it
off,
you
take
an
amount
and
then
you
first
figure
the
amount
of
the
annual
payment,
which
is
more
or
less
a
substitute
for
your
annual
contributions,
i
guess,
based
on--
why
couldn't
it
have
reasonably
been
argued
that
if
they
are
a
substitute
for
contributions
that
would
have
been
made
to
pay
off
this
liability,
they
should
bear
no
interest
at
all?
what
is
it
in
the
statute
that
forecloses
that
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry,
i
lost...
what
you
quoted--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
me
was
where?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
does
the
pbc...
how
do
they
explain
their
position,
if
they
say
they
can't
find
the
answer
in
the
statute?
