before
we
get
too
far
away
from
justice
stevens'
question,
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
the
answer.
if
schlitz
had
paid
the
full
amount
of
the
demand
in
1981...
that
is
to
say,
before
the
first
payment
was
due...
what
interest
component
would
schlitz
have
been
liable
for?
suppose
it
paid
it
the
day
after
the
demand...
when
was
the
demand,
sometime
in
august?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see
how
that
doesn't
undercut
your
position
that
the
interest
has
to
be
included
as
if
the
payment
isn't
made
until
january
1,
'82.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'd
say
that's
perfectly
sensible
from
a
financial
standpoint,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
undercut
your
theory
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
is
it
that
interest
is
not
charged
if
there's
a
full
discharge
at
once,
but
it
is
not
if
the
full
payment
is
made,
say,
on
the
first
payment
date?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
incidentally...
and
that's
your...
you
stick
with
your
answer
to
me
on
that
point?
i
wanted
to
make
sure
that
you
hadn't
changed
your
answer
to
me.
assume
full
payment
the
day
of
the
demand,
and
this
is
before
the
first
day
that
payment
is
due.
no
interest
due
at
all,
or
accrued
interest,
or
a
year's
interest?
there
are
three
choices.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
23.3?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
so
then,
a
full
year's
interest
must
be
paid.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
matter
if
it's
paid
on
the
date
of
demand,
and
even
if
that
date
of
demand
is
before
the
first
required
payment
under
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that's
a
different
answer
than
you
gave
me
the
first
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
had
thought
you
conceded
in
your
brief
that
no
interest
would
be
due
under
that...
under
that
hypothetical.
perhaps
i'm
incorrect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
before
you
get
off
the
prepaid
interest
statute,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
you
can
explain
the
"if
any"
consistently
with
the
position
that
schlitz
takes,
save
and
except
that
it
is
entitled
to
all
of
the
accrued
interest.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
"if
any"
could
mean
that,
assume
that
schlitz
in
the
third
year,
if
it's
making
yearly
payments,
decides
it's
going
to
pay
everything,
and
it
makes
a
timely
payment,
and
then
if
it
prepays
all
the
balance,
it
would
pay
no
interest,
and
that
could
explain
the
word
"if
any",
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
