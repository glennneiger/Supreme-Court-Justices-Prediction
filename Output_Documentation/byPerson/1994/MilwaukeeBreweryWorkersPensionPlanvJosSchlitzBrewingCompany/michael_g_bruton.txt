mr.
michael
g.
bruton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
1981,
the
joseph
schlitz
brewing
company
closed
its
milwaukee
plant
and
completely
withdrew
from
the
milwaukee
brewery
workers'
pension
plan,
a
defined
benefit,
multiemployer
plan
in
which
schlitz'
employees
had
participated
since
the
plan's
inception
in
1954.
in
the
late
1970's
and
early
1980's,
the
brewing
industry
in
milwaukee
was
considered
a
declining
industry.
the
number
of
hours
that
plan
participants
were
currently
working
were
diminishing.
at
the
same
time,
the
average
age
of
plan
participants,
as
well
as
their
length
of
service,
was
increasing.
as
a
result,
this
plan,
like
many
other
multiemployer
plans
at
that
time,
experienced
significant
underfunding
problems.
as
of
december
31st,
1980,
which
was
the
last
day
for
this
plan
in
the
year
prior
to
the
year
in
which
schlitz
withdrew,
this
plan
had
unfunded
but
vested
liabilities
in
excess
of
111
million
dollars.
that
amount
represented
the
difference,
as
of
that
day,
between
the
fair
cash
market
value
of
the
plan's
assets,
approximately
51
million
dollars,
and
the
present
cash
value
of
the
plan's
liability
to
pay
for
vested
benefits
at
some
future
date,
as
of
that
date,
approximately
162
million
dollars.
it's
significant
to
note
that
in
1980,
in
reducing
the
future
liabilities
for
present
cash...
for
the
vested
benefits
to
present
cash
value,
this
plan
used
a
discount
rate
of
7
percent.
after
carefully
studying
the
problems
that
multiemployer
plans
faced
in
the
area
of
underfunding,
and
the
application
of
erisa
to
the
multiemployer
plans,
congress
passed
the
multiemployer
pension
plan
amendments
act
of
1980,
or
mppaa.
perhaps
the
most
significant
portion
of
mppaa
is
the
requirement
that
a
withdrawing
employer
continue
to
make
payments
to
a
multiemployer
plan
in
an
effort
to
fully
fund
a
portion
of
the
unfunded
vested
liabilities
which
are
attributed
to
that
employer.
simply
stated,
the
question
in
this
case
is,
how
much
was
schlitz
required
to
pay
to
this
plan?
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
i
think
the
question,
your
honor,
is,
in
total
how
much
was
schlitz
required
to
pay?
the
important
component
of
the
amount
that
schlitz
was
required
to
pay
is
the
interest
on
the
unfunded
but
vested
benefits
that
were
allocated
to
it.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
that
is
correct.
it's
important...
the
answer
to
the
question
lies
in
the
proper
application
of
section
4219(c)(1)(a)
of
mppaa.
that
provision
can
be
found
at
page
4
of
the
blue
brief
of
the
petitioner.
in
that
section,
congress
very
carefully
and
with
great
detail
instructed
that
a
presumed
or
hypothetical
payment
schedule
should
be
created
in
order
to
determine
the
number
of
level
annual
payments
that
a
withdrawing
employer
should
be
required
to
make.
in
this
case,
of
the
111
million
dollars
in
unfunded
liabilities
as
of
december
31st,
1980,
schlitz
was
allocated
23.3
million
dollars,
but
schlitz
has
not
paid
23.3
million
dollars.
despite
never
missing
a
payment
and
never
being
late
with
a
payment,
schlitz
has
paid
28...
approximately
28.5
million
dollars.
the
plan
submits
that
when
section
4219(c)(1)(a)
is
properly
applied,
that
the
plan...
that
schlitz
should
have
paid
approximately
31.1
million
dollars.
that
2.6
million
dollar
difference
depends
on
how
the
first
payment
in
this
presumed
schedule,
which
must
be
established
under
4219,
is
treated.
the
plan
submits
that
when
properly
constructed,
the
payment
schedule
is
contained
in
the
blue
brief
of
petitioners
at
page
28
and
29.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
the
interpretation
of
the
proper
application
of
the
prepayment
provision
would
provide
the
answer
to
that
question.
the
prepayment--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--the
answer...
the
plan
submits
that
the
answer
is
that
interest
would
have
accrued
from--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
i
think
in
the
instance
in
which
the
first
payment
actually
occurred,
or
payment
in
full
actually
occurred
prior
to
the
first
day
of
the
plan
year
after
withdrawal,
that
interest
would
be
charged
only
for
the
period
from
the
last
day
of
the
plan
year,
the
day
on
which
the
amount
of
the
unfunded
vested
liabilities
are
fixed,
and
the
day
that
the
full
actual
payment
is
made.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
under
your
example,
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
and
in
order...
that
would
be
done
in
order
to
fully
fund
the
amount
of
the--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--i
think
that
congress
has
essentially
said,
we
are
going
to,
for
sake
of
convenience
and
ease
of
calculation,
eliminate--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--i
agree
that
the...
the
ease
of
calculation,
if
you
use
either
accrual
of
interest
from
the
date
that
the
amount
is
fixed,
the
date
of...
the
last
day
of
the
plan
year
before
the
withdrawal,
or
the
first
date
that
the
presumed
payment
is
made,
that
those
two
schedules
are
equally
easy
to
calculate.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
we
carefully
looked
at
the
statute,
and
we
could
find
no
support
in
the
statute
for
judge
easterbrook's
position
that
in
some
way
a
portion
of
the
interest
during
that
period
could
be
charged
to
the
withdrawing
employer.
the
statute
says
that
the
payment
should
be
amortized.
in
fact,
in
the
section
that's
at
issue
in
this
case,
the
word
"interest"
does
not
appear.
the
statute
does
not
limit
or
qualify
the
term,
"amortize".
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
we
view
the
statute
as
giving
no
alternative.
congress
could
have
provided
logically,
rationally,
reasonably
to
begin
interest
from
the
date
of
withdrawal,
or
until
the
date
of
the
first
actual
payment.
there
are
many
alternative
scenarios
that
congress
could
have
constructed
in
order
to
approach
the
equity
that
they
were
attempting
to
achieve.
however,
the
one
that
congress
selected
is
the
scenario
in
which
the
amount
of
the
unfunded
liabilities
are
calculated
as
of
the
last
day
of
the
plan
year
prior
to
withdrawal.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
in
fact,
if
it
occurred
on
the
last
day,
using
the
timetable
in
this
case
as
an
example,
if
the
withdrawal
in
this
case
had
occurred
on
december
31st,
1980,
the
calculation
of
the
amount
of
unfunded
vested
liabilities
would
have
been
as
of
december
31st,
1979.
the
employer
would
have
been
making
contributions
for
that
entire
year.
those
contributions
may
or
may
not
have
reduced
the
unfunded
vested
liabilities
from
the
level
that
they
existed
a
year
earlier.
congress,
in
order
to
eliminate
the
need
to
continually
recalculate
that
amount,
essentially
said
we
will
not
consider
for
that
year
of
withdrawal
any
additions
to
or
subtractions
from
the
unfunded
vested
liabilities.
in
other
words,
congress
considered
the
contributions
for
that
year,
the
actual
contributions
that
were
being
made,
as
a
wash,
and
for
purposes
of
making
the
calculation
easy
to
determine,
and
to
prevent
plans
from
incurring
enormous
actuarial
expenses
each
time
a
withdrawing
employer
decided
to
withdraw,
a
simple
method
of
just
designating
the
end
of
the
plan
year
prior
to
withdrawal
was
adopted.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
correct.
it
is
our
position
that
interest
accrues
from
the
date
that
the
amount
was
fixed,
the
end
of
the
prior
plan
year...
in
this
case
it
would
be
december
31st
of
1980.
if
schlitz
had
paid
the
full
amount
due
as
of
august
31st,
1981,
the
amount
of
interest
that
they
would
have
had
to
pay
in
addition
to
the
23.3
million
dollars,
would
be
interest
which
accrued
from
the
december
31st,
1980
date
to
the
august
31,
1981
date.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
congress
provided
that
an
employer--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--it
does
not,
because
the
prepayment
provision
is
entirely
separate
from
the
provision
that
is
utilized
to
calculate
the
number
of
longterm
payments,
so
to
speak.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
interest
would
accrue
up
until
that
first
payment
date.
at
that
point,
there
would
be
one
full
year
of
interest.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
the
scenario,
as
i
understood
the
hypothetical
question,
was
that
the
23.3
million
dollars
would
be
the
amount
tendered
at
the
first
full
payment,
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
would
be
insufficient,
because
by
that
point
in
time,
at
least
a
portion
of
the
first
year's
worth
of
interest
will
have
accrued.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
the
prepayment
provision,
which
is
set
forth
at
page
25
of
the
red
brief
of
the
respondent,
specifically
says
what
must
be
prepaid
in
order
to
comply
with
this
statute,
and
it
is
somewhat
counterintuitive.
the
employer
shall
be
entitled
to
prepay
the
outstanding
amount
of
the
unpaid
annual
withdrawal
liability
payments.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
it
does.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
the
statute
goes
on
to
say
that
they
should
also
pay
accrued
interest,
if
any.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
yes,
justice
souter
and,
in
fact,
while
it
is
not--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--it
is.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
and
in
fact,
while
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
i
think
that
taken
to
its
logical
extension,
the
entire
amount,
that
some
total
of
all
of
the
required
payments
in
this
presumed
schedule,
in
our
case
31.1
million,
is
the
amount
that
would
be
due
if
there
was
a
prepayment
at
any
time,
and
there--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--the
purpose
for
the
amortization
is
to
fully
fund
this
amount
which
was
calculated.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
if
it
was--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--if
the
amount
that
was
being
funded
was
calculated
as
of
the
date
that
the
first
payment
was
made,
i
agree
it
would
fully
fund--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--and
congress
has
said--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--congress
has
said
that--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--correct.
the
unlimited
use
of
the
term,
"amortize",
unqualified
by
any
other--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--well,
if
the
payment
is
made
on
the
same
day
the
debt
arises,
there
would
be
no
interest.
if
the
payment--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
prepayment
provision
would
require
full
payment
of
the
total
amount--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--the
31.1...
31.1.
the
sum
total
of
all
the
required
payments
under
this
hypothetical
presumed
schedule
that
was
created--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--right.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
correct.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
i
apologize
if
i
initially
was
confused.
the
prepayment
provision--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--i
believe
that
the
prepayment
provision
is
one
that
could
take
briefing
and
argument
and
debate
and
discussion
in
another
case.
it
is
a
complex
provision.
it
is
one
that
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case
because
there
was
no
prepayment.
however,
if
you
carefully
read
what
congress
permitted
in
the
prepayment
provision,
it
is
that
the
employer
is
entitled
to
prepay
the
outstanding
amount
of
the
unpaid
annual
withdrawal
liability
payments...
annual
withdrawal
liability
payments.
that
provision,
while
it
has
not
been
interpreted
by
this
court,
can
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
in
order
to
prepay
you
must
pay
the
full
sum
total
of
all
of
the
payments
in
this
schedule
which
is
created
by
4219.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
that
is
correct.
and
in
addition,
if
you
step
back
for
a
moment
and
put
this
in
the
context
of
mppaa,
in
which
this
court
has
already
recognized
the
purpose
was
to
protect
the
plan
participants
and
their
beneficiaries
as
well
as
the
employers
who
continued
to
contribute
to
the
plan,
a
scenario
could
be
constructed,
a
prepayment
scenario,
using
some
of
the
figures
in
this
case,
for
example,
wherein
an
employer,
in
times
of
decreasing
return
on
market
investments...
let's
say,
for
example,
the
market
was
returning
approximately
3
percent
rather
than
the
7
percent
interest
rate
which
was
used
in
this
case,
an
employer
would
have
an
incentive
to
prepay
if
it
did
not
have
to
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
annual
withdrawal
liability
payments.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
however,
these
payments
extend
over
a
20-year
period.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
there
are...
there
will
be
instances,
there
is
no
question
that
there
will
be
instances
in
which,
on
a
purely
actuarial
analysis
the
withdrawing
employer
will
pay
something
more
than
is
necessary
to
make
the
plan
whole.
however--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--not
necessarily,
justice
stevens.
we
don't
know,
because
it
was
never
determined
in
the
court
below
or
in
the
arbitration
proceeding,
precisely
what
happened
to
the
underfunding
of
this
plan.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
i
think
that
i--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--i
don't
believe
that
that
is
correct.
i
believe
that
the
amount
that
the
employer...
excuse
me,
the
plan,
will
typically
lose
if
schlitz'
interpretation
is
correct
is
the
amount
of
interest
on
one
full
year
on
the
unfunded
liabilities--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
the
amount
that's
fixed
as
of
day
zero,
however,
is
not
impacted
by
what
occurs
between
day
zero
and
day
365.
it
is
neither
reduced
nor
increased.
we
are
attempting
to
fund
at
the
end
of
day
5,000
or
6,000
the
amount
that
was
calculated
at
day
zero.
if
we
exclude
interest
from
day
zero
to
day
365
on
that
amount,
because
the
amount
is
not
affected
by
what
occurred
in
the
first
365
days,
positively
or
negatively,
then
there
will
be
a
deficiency
in
attempting
to--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--that
regular
monthly
payment,
however,
did
not
relate
to,
in
any
way,
the
23.3
million
that
was
calculated
as
of
day
zero.
those
regular
payments
may
or
may
not
have
changed
the
actual
amount
of
the
unfunded
liability.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
no,
because
congress
said,
we
want
to
amortize
the
amount
calculated
as
of
day
zero,
and
that
is
the
goal
and
the
purpose
of
this
whole
schedule,
to
fully
amortize
that
amount.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
it
is
not
included
in
the
section
4219(c)(1)(a).
however,
the
common
and
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term,
"amortize"...
schlitz
has
conceded
that
interest
payments
are
included
in
the
schedule.
schlitz
says
you'd
have
to
treat
the
first
payment--
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
--it
contemplates
that
in
each
payment
there
will
be
both
an
interest
component
and
a
component
attributed
to
reduce
the
amount
of
the
unfunded
benefits.
it
also
contemplates
that
at
the
end
of
this
payment
schedule
there
will
be
complete
and
full
funding
of
the
amount
being
amortized,
and
since
that
amount
is
23.3
million
dollars
as
of
day
zero,
in
order
to
fully
and
completely
fund
it,
there
must
be
interest
accruing
as
of
day
zero,
and
what
occurs
between
day
zero
and
day
365,
congress
has
said
we
will
disregard,
whether
it
be
favorable
to
the
plan
or
unfavorable
to
the
plan,
we
will
simply
disregard.
our
goal
here
is
to
allocate
a
portion
of
the
unfunded
vested
benefits
to
schlitz
as
of
day
zero
and
make
sure
that
schlitz
makes
enough
payments
to
fully
fund
it,
and
because
that
amount
was
reduced
by
the
7
percent
discount
rate,
the
interest
rate
must
also
be
7
percent
from
day
zero.
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
remaining
time
i
have.

the
pbgc
told
the
third
circuit
that
they
could
not
determine
what
congress
intended.
clearly,
if
there
is
any
ambiguity,
or
room
for
doubt,
when
the
amount
that
is
trying
to
be
amortized
is
considered
and
when
the
purpose
for
mppaa
is
applied
to
protect
plan
beneficiaries
and
the
participants
and
remaining
contributing
employers,
the
plan's
interpretation
is
the
only
one
that
makes
sense.
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
justice
stevens,
they
don't.
they
simply
say,
if
it's
not
there,
congress
must
not
have
intended
it,
and
we
simply
say,
by
using
the
word
"amortize",
schlitz
conceded
that's
sufficient
to
trigger
interest
on
all
the
other
payments,
why
isn't
it
sufficient
for
the
first?
mr.
michael
g.
bruton
thank
you.
