yes,
but
that's
always
true.
i
mean,
scenarios
can
go
one
way
or
the
other.
my
problem
with
the
case
is,
for
every
one
you
think
of
one
way,
you
can
think
of
a
counterbalancing
one
the
other
way.
but
where
it
doesn't
seem
to
counterbalance
is
just
the
point
that's
being
raised,
that
if
in
fact
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
correct,
then
wouldn't
employers
normally
have
to
pay
more
than
their
fair
share,
while
if
the
other
person's
interpretation
is
correct,
the
most,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
fund
could
ever
lose,
is
60
days'
worth
of
interest
plus
whatever
time
calculated.
do
you
see
why
i
arrive
at
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
is
it
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
see
one
full
year,
because
it
seemed
to
me
the
way
this
works
is,
23
million
is
what
would
be
necessary
to
make
the
plan
whole
as
of,
let's
call
it
day
zero,
and
then
the
statute
says,
how
many
payments
of
4
million
dollars,
because
that's
their
normal
payment...
say
how
many
payments
of
4
million
dollars
will
it
take
to
raise
that
23
million
if
the
first
payment
was
made
on
day
366--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right,
and
what
you
don't
know
is,
do
they
mean,
including
the
interest
for
that
year
or
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
frontloaded
or
backloaded.
now,
if
you
assume,
as
you'd
want
to,
that
it's
backloaded,
then
the
money
that's
coming
in
is
as
if
they
paid
not
a
penny
from
day
zero,
but
in
reality
the
employer
will
always
be
making
his
monthly
payments
throughout
the
year,
until
the
minute
he
withdraws,
and
as
of
the
minute
he
withdraws,
there's
then,
if
the
plan
wants
it,
it
can
get
as
much
as
they
want
60
days
later.
so
i
didn't
say,
see
how
in
reality
the
plan
could
lose
more
than
that
60-day
period,
plus
whatever
time
is
needed
to
calculate
this
big
calculation.
that's
how
i
reach
that
conclusion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
there
won't
be
if
the
employer
is
making
a
monthly
payment
during
that
whole
period.
if
he
pays
his
regular
monthly
payment
there's
no
problem.
the
fund's
getting
the
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
since
they
may
or
may
not
have,
shouldn't
we
assume
that
they
will
be
sufficient
to
keep
the
plan
where
it
was
left?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
that
that
lump
sum
thing
cuts
in
your
favor.
i'm
not
certain,
though,
that
it's
determinative,
and
if
your
position
is
right,
then
how
long
does
it
take
funds
normally
to
make
the
calculations
of
the
underfunding?
is
there
a
normal...
does
it
take
a
day,
or
a
month,
or
6
months,
or
when
do
they
normally
come
up
with
the
figures
of
last
year's
plan?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
if
that's
typical,
and
if
your
interpretation
is
correct,
and
the
60-day
period
is
there,
there
would
be
then
be
typically
8
months
of
interest
lost
to
the
funds,
which
means
that
typically
in
a
statute
designed
to
make
funds
whole,
you
would
have
8
months
too
little
money,
8
months'
worth
of
interest.
that
seems
to
me
an
odd
interpretation
of
a
statute
where
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
told
the
third
circuit
it
was
totally
unclear.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i'm
speaking
typically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
soon
can
they
do
the
calculation
if
they
really
want
to
do
it
as
quickly
as
possible?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
legislative
history,
i
had
this
slight
question.
it
seems
awrully
much
to
me
as
if
it's...
every
argument
i
see
a
counterargument.
it
seems
very,
very
ambiguous,
and
they
seem
mostly
to
wash.
the
thing
i
wondered,
though,
is
why
would
congress
have
brought
in
this
notion
of
this
second
year
if
it
hadn't
had
a
backloaded
amortization
in
mind?
what
they're
trying
to
do
is,
they
take
the
23
million,
and
they
ask
the
question,
how
many
payments
at
4
million
dollars
each
at
an
interest
rate
of
4
percent
will
be
necessary
to
raise
the
4
million?
that
question
has
the
same
answer
whether
you
calculate
it
as
of
the
date
of
year
zero,
or
as
the
date
of
year
1,
if,
in
fact,
it's
frontloaded,
so
why
would
they
have
brought
in
this
notion
of
the
second
year,
unless
they
meant
it
to
be
backloaded?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
strong
evidence
they
changed
it
to
frontloaded?
i
mean,
i
noticed
you
have
a
house
report
there
which
you
don't
quote--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
you
characterize.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
just
tell--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
can
look
it
up
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
they
did
is
not
change
to
the
first
day
of
the
year
when
due.
they
changed
it
to
the
first
day
of
the
plan
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
that's
totally
consistent
of
their
thinking
of
this
sum
as
if
the
sum
had
been
due
a
year
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
particularly
if
there's
no
evidence
they
intended
any
change
by
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
wasn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
milwaukee
brewery
workers’
pension
plan
v.
jos.
schlitz
brewing
company
has
to
do
with
the
multiemployer
pension
plan,
which
sometimes
they
are
underfunded.
there
isn't
enough
money
in
the
plan
and
an
employer
wants
to
withdraw
and
when
the
employer
does
withdraw
he
has
to
make
a
payment,
which
is
his
share
of
the
underfunding
and
the
issue
in
the
case,
when
makes
that
payment,
the
issue
before
us
was,
if
he
pays
in
installments,
when
does
interest
begin
to
run
and
the
statute
seems
to
give
two
choices.
it
either
begins
to
run
from
the
beginning
of
the
year
in
which
he
withdrew,
the
end
of
the
last
year
or
the
beginning
of
the
year
after
he
withdrew
and
the
question
is
which
is
it.
well,
basically
what
we
decided
looking
at
the
statute
is
it
tells
us
to
pretend
that
the
employer’s
first
installment
is
due
as
if
the
first
day
of
the
next
year
and
we
decided
that’s
when
interest
begins
to
run
because
normally
you
don’t
pay
interest
on
something
until
you
actually
have
to
pay
the
money.
now,
the
reasons
are
much
more
complicated
than
that,
but
they
are
all
spelled
out
in
the
opinion
if
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
