justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
isn't
the...
all
right,
isn't
that
if
the
calculation
is
made
on
the
assumption
in
effect
on
your
theory
that
the
debt
becomes
due
on
december
31
of
the
previous
year,
and
that
the
first
payment
is
made
on
january
1
of
the
year
following
the
withdrawal,
so
isn't
there
always
going
to
be
1
year's
accrued
interest
whenever
you
make
the
first
payment,
even
if
you
prepay
it?
aren't
you
liable
for
1
year's
accrued
interest?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
thought
the
payment
schedule...
i
mean,
first
there's
a
calculation
as
to
the
unfunded
liability.
then
there's
a
calculation...
as
i
understand
it,
based
on
these
conventions
of
december
31
of
one
year,
january
1
of
the
next
following
one,
there
is
a
calculation
of
the
first
payment
due,
and
the
first
payment
due
is
made
on
the
conventional
assumption
that
a
year
is
going
to...
a
full
year
is
going
to
elapse.
so
therefore,
isn't
the
question,
on
your
theory,
not
whether
8
months
of
interest
would
have
accrued
if
x
dollars
was
due
on...
it
was
due
8
months
before,
but
rather,
isn't
the
accrued
liability
plus
a
year's
interest
due
whenever
you
make
the
first
payment,
whether
you
make
it
at
the
last
possible
date,
or
whether
you
make
it
at
the
first
possible
date?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
doesn't
that
annual
withdrawal
liability
payment
include
on
this
conventional
calculation
basis
a
year
of
interest?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
then
why
is
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
that
he
only
has
to
pay
8
months
of
interest?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
thought
your
answer...
i
thought
your
interpretation
of
that
provision
was
that
accrued
interest
there
refers
to
interest
which
accrued
on
any
payments
as
to
which
the
employer
was
delinquent.
we're
not
talking
about
delinquency
payments.
we're
talking
about
the
interest,
which
is
never
called
interest
in
the
statute,
which
is
implied
by
the
concept
of
amortization,
so
it
seems
to
me
that,
given
your
answers
both
to
the
socalled
if
any
objection,
and
your
construction
of
the
statute
based
on
this
conventional
scheme,
that
the
first
payment,
whenever
it
is
made,
even
if
it
is
prepaid
at
the
first
possible
moment,
should
include
a
year's...
a
year
of
interest.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
your
answer
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
annual
is
calculated
on
the
assumption
that
the
debt
begins
to
run
on
the
date
that
the
amount
of
the
debt
is
calculated,
and
that
no
payment
is
made
until
a
full
year
has
elapsed,
so
therefore
the
annual
payment
implies,
by
definition,
a
year
of
interest.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
the...
i
mean,
the
counterargument
there
is
that
the
entire
set
of
calculations
is
being
done
on
a
set
of
conventional
assumptions,
and
one
conventional
assumption
is
that
the
date...
that
the
debt,
rather,
comes
into
existence
on
the
date
it's
amount
is
calculated,
so
that
if
literally
you
paid
at
any
time
after
that
date,
the
december
31
date,
some
interest
would
have
run.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
unclear
after
the
argument?
i
mean,
i
thought
it
was
clear
after
the
argument
that
at
least
a
year's
interest--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
going
to
be
added
on.
i
thought
that
was
their
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
under
their
interpretation,
as
i
understand
it,
the
word,
"interest"
preceding
"if
any"
would
refer
to
interest
on
delinquent
payments,
because
their
argument
is
that
interest...
the
interest
that
is
implied
by
the
concept
of
amortization
is,
in
fact,
never
expressly
referred
to
in
the
statute,
and
that
when
the
statute
does
speak
of
interest,
it's
referring
to
interest
on
delinquency,
so
i'd
like
to
know
your
response
to
that,
but
isn't...
to
begin
with,
isn't
their
view,
at
least
internally,
consistent?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
wouldn't
in
these
fat
years,
but
whatever
rule
we
come
up
with
is
going
to
be
a
rule
for
the
lean
years,
too.
you're
saying
they
had
a
lot
of
good
luck,
but
i
mean,
we
can't
construe
the
statute
on
the
assumption
that
even
conservative
actuaries
are
always
going
to
produce
that
much
luck
for
them.
