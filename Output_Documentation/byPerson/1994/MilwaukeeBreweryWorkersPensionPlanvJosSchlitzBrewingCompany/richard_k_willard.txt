mr.
richard
k.
willard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
schlitz'
position
is
that
the
obligation
to
pay
does
not
arise
until
after
the
plan
calculates
the
amount
of
the
withdrawal
liability
and
transmits
a
demand
for
payment,
so
that
if
schlitz
were
to
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
principal
in
this
case,
the
allocated
share
of
the
unfunded
vested
benefits,
within
the
demand
period,
then
it
would
pay
no
interest.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
your
honor,
they
did
in
an
amicus
brief
filed
in
the
third
circuit
in
the
huber
case,
which
agreed
with
our
position.
they
did
not
express
a
position
in
this
court,
and
the
solicitor
general's
brief
filed
at
the
petition
stage
pointed
out
that
that
expressed
the
views
of
the
solicitor
general
but
not
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
i'd
like
to
explain
why
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
supports
our
view
that
if
full
payment
were
made
within
the
initial
demand
period
there
would
be
no
interest.
we
point
out...
we
quote
on
pages
10
and
11
of
our
red
brief
the
language
of
section
1381
and
section
1382.
section
1381
defines
the
term,
the
withdrawal
liability,
and
it
has
a
definition
in
there,
it
has
several
stages,
and
it's
very
clear
that
that
definition
does
not
include
any
component
for
interest.
section
1382,
which
we
also
quote
at
page
11
of
our
brief,
said,
this
is
the
amount,
the
withdrawal
liability
which
the
plan
assesses
and
collects
from
the
withdrawing
employer.
section
1399(b),
which
is
also
quoted
and
referred
to
in
our
brief,
pages
21
and
22,
provides
that
the
demand
notice
that's
sent
out
by
the
plan
when
there's
a
withdrawal
includes
two
things,
the
amount
of
the
liability...
that's
determined
in
the
statute...
and
the
schedule
for
liability
payments,
so
there's
a
distinction
drawn
in
the
statute
between
the
demand
for
liability
and
the
schedule
of
payments,
and
in
fact,
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
demand
letter
sent
by
the
plan
to
schlitz,
which
appears
at
page
153
of
the
joint
appendix,
includes
a
number.
it
includes
the
wrong
number...
it's
41
million
dollars.
later
it
was
reduced
to
23.3
million
dollars,
but
it
includes
a
number,
and
that
number
is
the
principal
amount
of
the
allocated
share
of
unfunded
vested
benefits.
that's
the
amount
they
demanded
that
schlitz
pay.
it
didn't
include
any
interest,
and
in
the
hearing
before
the
arbitrator,
which
is
also
cited
in
our
brief,
the
plan's
expert
witness
agreed
that
this
amount
did
not
include
any
interest.
and
so
we
have
a
situation
where,
under
the
statute,
and
as
the
demand
letter
was
sent
in
this
case,
a
demand
was
made
for
the
payment
of
a
principal
sum,
no
interest,
and
our
position
is
that
if
schlitz
had
paid
that
principal
sum,
it
would
have
paid
no
interest
at
all,
and
therefore,
that
is
the
point
at
which
the
liability
arises,
and
if
schlitz
chose
to
pay
over
time
thereafter,
interest
would
begin
to
accrue
at
the
point
that
the
liability
arises.
the
position
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
would
be
a
little
bit
as
if
you
were
buying
a
house
and
interest
began
to
run
not
from
the
date
title
was
transferred,
but
from
the
date
the
appraisal
was
done,
which
may
have
been
some
months
earlier.
normally
interest
accrues--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--well,
that
is
the
position
that
the
plaintiff
has
taken,
although
it's
a
little
unclear
how
much
interest
they
claim
would
arise
and
how
it
would
be
calculated,
but--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--right.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
i
believe
his
position
was
8
years
of
interest
would
be
added
on.
in
other
words,
if
you
prepaid
you'd
have
to
pay
all
the
interest
that
would
have
accrued
during
the
entire
schedule.
page
13
of
their
reply
brief
i
believe
that's
the
position
they
take,
and
i
thought
that's
what
he
was
saying
here
today.
the
prepaying
provision,
though,
section
1399(c)(4),
refers
to
accrued
interest,
if
any,
and
that
appears
at
page
7a
in
bold
face
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
it
says
that
you
shall
be
entitled
to
prepay
plus
accrued
interest,
if
any,
and
under
their
interpretation
of
the
statute,
there
would
always
be
accrued
interest,
because
interest
would
run--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--there's
one
problem
with
their
view,
justice
souter,
and
that
is
that
the
subsection
(6),
which
appears
at
page
9a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
refers
to
the
interest
that's
used
in
calculating
the
amortization
schedule
as
an
exception
to
the
normal
interest
accrual
rule.
it
says,
"except
as
provided
in
paragraph
(1)(a)(ii).
"
which
is
where
it
talks
about
constructing
the
amortization
schedule,
"interest
under
this
subsection
shall
be
charged
at
rates
based
on
prevailing
market
rates.
"
which
refers
then
to
the
delinquent
interest,
so
the
statute
itself
in
(6)
appears
to
create
two
categories
of
interest,
interest
that's
charged
at
prevailing
market
rates,
which
is
the
default
interest,
and
interest
which
is
calculated
as
it
is
under
paragraph
(1)(a)(ii),
which
refers
to
the
construction
of
the
amortization
schedule.
so
while
the
statute
is
admittedly
a
bit
opaque,
it
does
appear
to
view
interest
as
being
involved
in
both
concepts.
the
amortization
schedule
as
well
as
the
payment
of
delayed...
payment
of
interest
on
delayed
obligations.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
justice
kennedy,
that
was
the
explanation
that
the
third
circuit
in
huber
gave
to
the
"if
any"
language.
that
assumes
that
if
they
paid
off
the
balance
on
one
day
and
then
turned
around
and
made
a
principal
payment--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--on
the
same
day,
that
that
would
be
treated
as
two
separate
payments,
but
normally,
at
any
point
after
the
amortization
schedule
begins,
there
would
be
some
accrued
interest
at
that
point,
and
so
if
you
were
to
prepay
at
any
point
after
the
amortization
schedule
starts,
there
would
be
some
amount
of
accrued
interest.
it's
interesting,
the
legislative
history
discloses
when
that
"if
any"
term
appeared.
the
original
version
of
this
statute,
as
drafted
by
pbgc,
provided
that
interest
accrued
from
the
date
of
withdrawal
until
paid
at
market
rates,
a
very
simple,
maybe
sensible
solution,
but
one
that
congress
got
rid
of.
instead,
they
took
out
all
references
to
interest
accruing
on
timely
paid
obligations
and
added
in
the
words
60-day
demand
for
payment,
to
indicate
that
they
contemplated
that
if
timely
payment
was
made
immediately
after
withdrawal,
there
wouldn't
be
interest,
that
interest
would
only
accrue
if
you
paid
over
time
and
not
in
a
lump
sum
at
once.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
the
record
shows
in
this
case
that
the
valuations
were
generally
done
about
the
middle
of
the
year,
may,
june,
july.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
i
think
we
should
look
at
the
facts
of
our
case
to
try
to
illustrate
that.
it
really
depends
on
when
the
withdrawal
occurs
during
the
plan
year.
if
it
begins
at
the
very
beginning--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--that's
right.
if
it
occurs
at
the
beginning
of
the
plan
year,
then
there
would
be
a
longer
gap
while
waiting
for
the
valuation.
the
valuation
has
to
be
done
by
statute
every
year
anyway,
and
so
the
statute,
by
keying
onto
this,
produces
an
efficiency,
because
if
the
valuation
is
already
done,
then
it's
a
very
simple
matter
to
get
the
assessment
made.
here
in
this
case
the
valuation
date
was
december
31st,
1980.
schlitz
withdrew
in
august
of
1981.
in
fact,
they
only
made
5
months
of
contributions
during
that
plan
year,
because
they
were
struck
on
may
31st
and
ceased
operations
thereafter.
but
for
5
months
of
the
year
they
were
making
contributions,
and
the
contributions
were
required
by
statute
to
include
an
amount
to
amortize
the
unfunded
liability,
to
bring
down
the
23
million
dollar
liability
to
a
lower
number
and,
in
fact,
here,
they
did.
pages
201
to
206
of
the
joint
appendix
show
that
the
normal
cost
of
this
plan
was
only
a
little
over
1
million
dollars
a
year,
and
yet
the
actual
contributions
projected
for
the
year
were
9
million,
so
almost
90
percent
of
the
contributions
that
were
being
made
were
going
to
pay
interest
on
or
to
reduce
the
unfunded
liabilities.
only
a
little
over
10
percent
were
actually
normal
cost.
so
during
that
5-month
period,
schlitz
made
a
considerable
contribution
to
reduce
the
amount
of
the
liability.
then
there
is
the
gap.
the
demand...
the
withdrawal
was...
notice
was
given
in
august,
the
demand
letter
was
sent
on
september
29th,
the
actual
first
payment
was
due
and
paid
by
november
1st.
that's
not
60
days,
because
the
statute
says,
up
to
60
days.
the
plan
can
demand
payment
in
less
than
60
days,
if
it
chooses
to
do
so,
and
it
did
so
here.
demand
was
made
september
29th
for
payment
by
november
1st,
which
is
only
a
little
over
a
month.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
if
the
valuation
is
done,
then
it
should
just
be
a
matter
of
a
few
days.
the
tricky
part
of
it
is
coming
up
with
actuarial
valuation.
that
report,
once
it's
done,
sets
the
amount
of
unfunded
liabilities,
and
then
the
only
issue
is
allocating
out
among
the
employers.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens,
it
is.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
is
part
of
the
routine
accounting,
and
i
should
note
also
that
the
allocation
here,
and
in
fact
this
whole
issue,
is
a
dispute
among
employers.
this
is
a
dispute...
the
real
parties
at
interest
on
the
other
side
are
miller
and
pabst,
because
if
the
more
schlitz
pays
as
a
withdrawal
liability,
the
less
they
have
to
pay,
and
vice
versa,
so
this
is
not
a
dispute
between
beneficiaries
and
employers.
instead,
it's
a
dispute
among
employers
for
how
the
funding
is
going
to
be
allocated.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not.
i'm
simply
pointing
out
that
the
real
interest
here
is
the
interest
of
the
remaining
employers,
because
if
schlitz
contributes
less,
then
the
remaining
employers
have
to
contribute
more
to
make
up
unfunded
liability.
in
other
words,
the
statutory
scheme--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--i
understand,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
there
will
always
be
some
gap,
in
this
case
a
few
months
only,
whereas
under
the
petitioner's
view,
they
would
always
assess
12
months'
interest,
even
though
the
gap
is
much
shorter.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
first
of
all,
if
the
statute
is
silent
on
the
issue
of
charging
interest
of
this
withdrawal
here,
period,
then
we
believe
that
the
courts
do
not
have
the
authority
on
their
own
to
impose
that
liability.
in
other
words,
if
congress
forgot
to
take
care
of
this
problem,
or
if
there
is
a
gap
in
the
statutory
scheme,
then
that
should...
that
problem
should
be
solved
by
congress
and
not
the
courts.
in
our
view,
the
statutory
language
makes
it...
does
not
provide
for
the
assessment
of
this
interest,
and
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
this
was
not
a
simply
oversight
but
was
a
deliberate
choice
that
congress
made
in
the
process
of
drafting
the
statute.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
our
position
is,
there's
not
room...
this
is
not
an
ambiguous
statute
that
could
be
read
to
allow
the
imposition
of
interest.
there
simply
is
nothing
here
that
provides
for
it.
it's
clear
under
the
statute
that
the
liability
arises,
and
the
amount
of
the
liability,
when
it
arises,
is
the
principal
amount,
not
the
principal
amount
plus
a
year
of
interest,
and
so
we
don't
think
there's
room
here
for
the
court
to
find
the
imposition
of
interest,
and
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
it
is
a
deliberate
choice.
there
is
the
reference
to
whether
or
not
the
liability
is
frontloaded
or
backloaded.
well,
at
one
point
the
liability
was
backloaded.
the
first
markup
of
the
bill
provided
that
the
presumed
payments...
the
payments
were
presumed
to
be
made
as
if
they
occurred
at
the
end
of
the
year
in
which
made,
and
that
allowed
for
the
payment
of
1
year
of
interest
in
the
first
year's
payments
of
interest.
then,
for
some
unexplained
reason,
by
the
time
it
was
passed
on
the
floor,
that
was
changed.
the
presumed
payment
occurred
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
in
which
the
payments
were
made.
so
the
statute,
while
it
was
originally
backloaded,
turned
into
a
frontloaded
statute
between
the
first
markup
and
the
time
the
bill
passed
on
the
floor
of
the
house.
why?
we
don't
know
for
sure.
we
do
know
that
a
number
of
changes
were
being
made
to
reduce
the
amount
of
withdrawal
liability
during
the
legislative
process
because
of
complaints
by
employers
that
this
was
too
onerous,
and
we
also
know
that
at
least
one
witness
testified,
and
we
cited
this
at
page
39
of
our
brief,
that
the
interest
charges
under
the
original
bill
would
have
been
excessive.
so
while
congress
didn't
say,
this
is
why
we
made
the
change,
we
know
they
were
making
changes.
they
said
they
were
making
a
number
of
changes
in
order
to
reduce
the
amount
of
liability
imposed
on
employers,
and
they
took
a
statute
where
the
interest
was
backloaded
and
turned
it
into
one
that
was
frontloaded.
so
while
there
are
a
number
of
other
aspects
of
the
legislative
history
that
we
think
support
our
reading
of
this
statute,
we
think
it's
clear
that
as
to
this
one
feature,
the
accrual
of
interest,
it
is
that
interest
would
not
accrue
until
the
point
that
the
amortization
schedule
began.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
i
understand,
justice
stevens,
and
initially
i
thought
maybe
there
wasn't
any
provision
for
statutory
interest.
after
we
look
at
it,
though,
there
is
this
reference
to,
in
the
section
accruing
at
market
rates,
that
says,
"except
as
provided
in
paragraph
(1)(a)(ii).
"
this
is
quoted
at
page
9a
of
the
red
brief,
and
we...
and
that
is
the
paragraph
in
which
there's
a
reference
to
constructing
the
amortization
schedule,
and
so
our
view
is
that
congress,
while
they
may
have
camouflaged
what
they
were
doing
so
that
it
wouldn't
be
apparent
they
were
charging
interest--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
paragraph...
page
9a
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
bold
face.
this
is
the
provision
about
interest
being
charged
at
market
rates.
it
says,
"except
as
provided
in
paragraph
(1)(a)(ii),
interest
shall
be
charged
at
market
rates.
"
paragraph
(1)(a)(ii),
if
we
look
back
to
page
4a,
is
the
statement
that
the
determination
of
the
amortization
period
shall
be
based
on
the
assumptions
which
includes
the
interest
rate
assumption.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
so
it's
hidden
in
there,
and
i
don't
know
why.
i
think
maybe
congress
was
sensitive
to
all
the
complaints
they
got
about
interest
and
decided
to
hide
what
they
were
doing,
but
that's
the
choice
they
made.
i'd
like
also
to
follow
up
a
little
further
on
the
question
justice
ginsburg
asked
about
whether
our
interpretation
means
that
the
plan
is
shortchanged.
i
mean,
i
think
we
can
see
that
both
interpretations
are
not
precise.
one
may
lend
itself
to
overpayment,
one
to
underpayment,
but
there
are
a
number
of
other
features
of
the
statutory
scheme
that
protect
plans
and
go
against
the
withdrawing
employer,
that
should
more
than
outweigh
the
loss
of
a
few
months'
interest.
actuarial
projections
generally
are
imprecise
and
are
normally
supposed
to
be
conservative.
that
is,
actuaries
are
supposed
to
overestimate
the
liabilities,
not
underestimate
them,
and
here,
for
example,
as
pointed
out
at
page
174
of
the
joint
appendix,
this
plan
was
earning
in
the
year
of
the
valuation
over
15
percent
of
its
investments,
and
yet
they
assumed
they
would
only
be
able
to
earn
7
percent
as
the
actuarial
rate
of
return.
now,
that's
perfectly
proper
for
an
actuary
to
do.
they're
supposed
to
be
conservative.
but
if,
in
fact,
the
plan
earned
more
than
7
percent
on
its
investments,
then
they
wouldn't
need
nearly
as
much
money
as
they
projected,
and
schlitz
would
have
overpaid.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
i
understand,
justice
souter,
but
what
i'm
pointing
out
is,
actuaries
generally
try
to
err
on
the
conservative
side,
so
it's
not
a
situation
where
it's
equally
likely
to
be
wrong
one
way
than
another.
actuaries
are
supposed
to
and,
generally,
try
to
be
conservative
to
provide
a
cushion
there,
so
there
is
a
cushion
that's
provided.
also,
the
annual
payment
formula
here
is
skewed
to
require
employers
in
a
declining
industry
like
this
to
pay
more
money
after
they
withdraw
than
they
did
before,
so
that
the
annual
contribution
from
schlitz
actually
went
up
after
it
withdrew
and
no
longer
had
employees
participating
in
the
plan.
and
then
finally,
the
plan
is
revalued
every
year,
and
the
assumptions
are
adjusted,
so
if
in
fact
the
plan
is
having
a
streak
of
bad
luck,
the
actuarial
assumptions
are
adjusted,
the
funding
levels
are
changed,
and
the
remaining
employers
make
up
the
difference.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
they
didn't
because
it
was
originally
backloaded
and
they
changed
it
to
frontloaded.
now--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--it
may
have--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--right.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
right.
well,
we
cite
to
the
text
of
the
bill
as
it
was
marked
up,
and
we
actually
reproduce
it
in
appendix
a
to
our
brief,
and
so
if
we
look
at
page...
and
it
may
take
me
just
a
moment
to
find
this--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--but
i
will--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--it
is...
we
cite
in
this
appendix
both
the
original
pbgc
bill,
then
we
include
in
here
in
italics
in
brackets
the
language
of
the
first
markup,
and
then
we
include
the
language
in
bold
face
as
finally
enacted,
and
the...
here
we
go,
here.
the--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--page
3a
of
the
appendix
to
the
red
brief,
and
in
the
very
middle
of
it,
two
i's...
this
would
be...
italicized
paragraph
in
the
very
middle
of
the
page.
it
says,
the
period
of
years
necessary
to
amortize
the
liability
in
level
annual
payments,
determined
under
paragraph
(b)
as
if
each
payment
were
made
at
the
end
of
the
year
when
due.
that's
backloaded.
that's
the
language
of
the
markedup
bill
in
the
subcommittee
of
the
house
education
and
labor
committee.
now,
that
very
language
got
changed.
we
flip
over
to
the
bold
face
on
page
4a,
and
it
says
that...
calculated
as
if
the
first
payment
were
made
on
the
first
day
of
the
plan
year...
this
is
the
first
paragraph
at
the
top
of
the
page,
in
the
middle
of
it...
as
if
made
on
the
first
day
of
the
plan
year
following
the
plan
year
in
which
the
withdrawal
occurs
and
as
if
each
subsequent
payment
were
made
on
the
first
day
of
the
subsequent
plan
year.
so
it's--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--that
change
was
made
after
the
initial
markup--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--in
the
subcommittee.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
before
the
full
committee
report.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
so
it
was
after
the
subcommittee--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--before
the
full
committee.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--i
don't
know,
justice
scalia.
we
know--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--right.
right,
could
easily
be
more,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
what
they
had
in
mind,
justice
scalia.
i'm
talking
about
what
they
did.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that's
right.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
but
at
that
time--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--but
at
that
time,
the
actuarial
valuation
date
was
not
a
year
before.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
it
was
not.
in
other
words,
there
were...
this
gets
more...
this...
justice
breyer,
this...
the
legislative
history
of
this
is
complicated,
but
once
it
is
sorted
through,
the
picture
it
paints
is
fairly
clear.
the
actuarial
valuation
date
at
that
point
was...
there
were
alternatives,
depending
on
whether
you
use
the
presumptive
method,
in
which
case
it
was
the
end
of
the
year
in
which
withdrawal
occurred,
or
all
other
methods
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
year
in
which
withdrawal
occurred,
and
so
for
them
to
have
required
there
to
be
1
year
of
interest
in
addition
to
the
interest
of
the
year
in
which
the
payment
was
made
would
have
required
2
years
of
interest,
but
that
would
not
necessarily
have
taken
you
back
to
the
valuation
day,
which
might
have
been
1
year,
a
year
and
a
half,
2
years,
who
knows?
in
other
words,
never,
throughout
the
drafting
of
this
statute,
did
congress
tie
the
accrual
of
interest
to
the
valuation
date.
it
might
have
coincided
with
it
at
one
point
or
another
by
chance.
it
doesn't
coincide
with
it
now,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history,
that
suggests
congress
thought
interest
should
accrue
from
the
valuation
date,
any
more
there's
any...
than...
than
interest
would
accrue
from
the
date
the
appraisal
is
done
on
your
home.
congress
has
always
indicated
that
the
interest
accrual
is
keyed
to
the
payment
schedule,
and
when
they
changed
it
from
a
backloaded
to
a
frontloaded
payment
schedule.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
yes,
justice
scalia,
the
people
who
were
drafting
that.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
the
various
people
who
changed
it
as
it
went
along,
and
they
may
have
even
been
staffers,
but
whoever
they
were,
they
did
it,
and
that's
what
happened,
and
so
we
have
a
statute
here
that
does
not
provide
for
the
accrual
of
interest
prior
to
the
time
the
amortization
schedule
begins,
that
does
not
tie
it
in
any
way
to
the
valuation
date,
and
on
that
basis,
we
conclude
the
court
has
no
choice
but
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
as
i
recall
in
huber,
justice
ginsburg,
the
withdrawal
occurred
at
the
outset
of
the
plan
year,
and
so
it
was
a
little
hard
to
tell
whether
the
court
in
huber
meant
that
interest
should
accrue
from
the
date
of
withdrawal
or
from
the
end
of
the
prior
plan
year,
since
they
were
so
close
together
in
time,
and
in
fact
one
later
district
court
case
which
we
cite,
which
was
affirmed
by
the
third
circuit
without
opinion,
seemed
to
have
thought
that
it
was
accruing
from
the
withdrawal
date
and
not
from
the
end
of
the
prior
plan
year.
i
have
to
agree
those
opinions
are
somewhat
murky,
and
so
i
can
understand
why
judge
easterbrook
may
have
been
confused.
also,
i
would
point
out
that
in
none
of
these
cases
up
till
now
has
interest
really
been
the
principal
issue
in
the
case.
even
in
the
court
of
appeals
here,
other
issues
predominated,
and
so
it
may
be
that
other
courts
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
this
interest
rate
accrual
issue
in
quite
as
much
detail
as
we
have
in
briefing
it
for
the
court
today,
or
the
court
has
in
studying
it.
