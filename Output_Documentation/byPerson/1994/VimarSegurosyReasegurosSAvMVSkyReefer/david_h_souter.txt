justice
david
h.
souter
but
wasn't
that
issue
expressly
reserved
by
the
first
circuit?
they
don't
have
it...
their
opinion...
one
of
their
footnotes
i
thought
indicated
that
they
didn't
reach
that
issue,
and
that
issue
wasn't
before
them,
so
there
was
no...
they
were
not
ruling
based
on
the
state
of
japanese
law,
and
they
were
assuming
that
of
course,
if
they
were
correct,
that
would
be
reached
in
the
first
instance
by
the
arbitrator,
but
we
don'
have
that
before
us
to
review
in
any
case,
do
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
might
be
so
determined
by
the
arbitrator
if
it
gets
to
arbitration.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
that's
not
foreclosed
by
the
reference
to
arbitration.
that
may,
in
fact,
be
exactly
the
result.
justice
david
h.
souter
assuming
that
lessening
can
mean
something
other
than
the
application
of
a
rule
which
imposes
a
lower
standard
of
liability,
assuming
that
in
your
favor,
isn't
there
something
a
little
bit
antique
about
the
argument
that
by
having
to
go
to
tokyo
or
morocco
or
what-not,
the
injured
party
is
being
dragged
around
the
world?
i
mean,
isn't
virtually
every
situation
going
to
be
exactly
like
this?
it
isn't
the
injured
party.
bacchus
isn't
running
around
the
world,
a
marine
insurer
is,
and
i
assume
you,
as
a
marine
insurer,
have
some
sense
of
your
exposure
to
appear
in
various
forums
of
arbitration
around
the
world,
so
isn't
there
something
a
little
bit
outdated
about
the
argument
that
liability
in
fact
is
being
lessened
by
having
to
go
to
tokyo
or
morocco?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
wouldn't
you
make
the
same
argument
if
the
arbitration
was
going
to
be
in
los
angeles?
is
it
that
you
just
want
a
bright
line
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would
be
just
as
tough
for
you
to
go
there
as
it
would
be
to
go
to
lisbon.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
isn't
that...
aren't
you
now
talking
about
substantive
rules
of
arbitration
as
opposed
to
the
cost
of
having
to
go
somewhere?
i
mean,
those
are...
i
understand
the
two
different
arguments,
but
aren't
they
two
different
arguments,
and
the
reason
that
you
might
like
los
angeles
better
than
lisbon
is
because
of
the
rules,
but
so
far
as
the
cost
argument
is
concerned,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
why
is
it
harder
to
go
to...
i've
been
saying
lisbon,
than
to
go
to
los
angeles?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
they
don't
like
the
law
when
they
get
there,
but
that's...
you
know,
that's
an
argument,
but
it's
a
different
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying
that
every
time
the
arbitration
clause
also
contains
a
kind
of
specific
choice
of
law
clause,
that
the
arbitration
clause
carries
the
choice
of
law
clause
with
it,
as
it
did
in
justice
stevens'
example?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
do
you
get
to
the
point
of
fundamental
unfairness,
because
you
were
arguing
it
was
okay
in
his
example,
because
they
had
negotiated
and
accepted
it.
where
do
you
get
to
the
point
of
fundamental
unfairness
on
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that
would
be
unfair
because
in
effect
there
would
be
no
fair
arbitral
forum.
the
example
that
justice
stevens
was
giving
was
assuming,
i
think,
that
there
was
a
perfectly
reasonable
arbitration
process
that
just
happened
to
be
a
rule
that
displaced
the
liability
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
i
guess
what
you're
saying
is,
it
may
get
to
the
point
of
fundamental
unfairness
if
there's
something
fundamentally
wrong
with
the
arbitration
process,
but
it
never
gets
to
the
point
of
fundamental
unfairness
if
it
simply
substitutes
different
rules
of
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
could
lose
on
that
point
entirely,
and
still
you
would
maintain...
i
assume
you
would
maintain
the
position
that
the
mere
existence
of
the
arbitration
clause
is
not
what
the
statute
means
by
lessening
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
guess...
am
i
correct
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
ultimately
assuming
was
that
the
question
of
their
resemblance
would
be
decided
in
the
first
instance
by
the
arbitrator,
the
district
court
would
retain
jurisdiction,
and
subject
to
whatever
rules
for
review
of
arbitration
might
exist,
the
issue
could
ultimately
come
back
to
the
district
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
simply
would
be
resolved
by
arbitration
in
the
first
instance,
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
was
assumed?
