chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
v.
reaseguros...
no,
vimar
seguros
y
reaseguros
v.
m/v
sky
reefer...
the
spectators
are
admonished
to
remain
quiet
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
is
still
in
session.
mr.
mcdermott.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
saying
that
this
would
necessarily
lessen
the
liability
of
a
carrier?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
your
authority
for
it?
what
case
do
you
rely
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
case
from
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
fact
the
bremen
v.
zapata
case
suggests
quite
a
different
approach,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
much
more
tolerant
approach
to
arbitration
clauses,
and
a
less
distrust
of
foreign
forum
and
foreign
laws.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
talked
about
relieving,
or...
was
it
relieving
or
lessening?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
we're
not
talking
about
a
guilty
plea
here.
we're
talking
about
an
engagement
that
sophisticated
businesspeople
enter
into.
if
they
sign
it,
why
isn't
that
enough?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
i
didn't
say
the
bill
of
lading
was
a
sophisticated
document.
i
said,
sophisticated
businessmen
enter
into
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
there
must
be
a
case-specific
inquiry
every
time
there's
a
bill
of
lading
as
to
whether
the
shipper
read
it
or
not,
or
knew
of
its
contents?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
strange
doctrine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
are
you
advocating?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
that.
why
should
that
be?
i
mean,
why
aren't
grown
people
bound
by
the
agreements
that
they
enter
into?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
every
time
we
get
a
consent
agreement
to
arbitrate
under
the
faa,
we...
a
court
must
look
at
it
to
make
sure
that
the
parties
had
what
you
called
informed
consent
that
they
had
read
the
terms
of
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcdermott.
mr.
walsh,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
negotiable
in
the
bills
and
notes
sense--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--not
as
a
subject
of
the
word
"negotiated".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
thank
you,
mr.
walsh.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
94-623,
vimar
seguros
y
reaseguros
v.
m/v
sky
reefer
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
