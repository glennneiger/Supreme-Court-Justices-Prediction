justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clear
that
the
application
of
foreign
law
is
prohibited
by
cogsa,
if
foreign
law
is
the
same
as
cogsa
itself?
do
we
have
a
case
that
involves
that,
where
the
foreign
law
is
identical?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
congress--
--i
thought
it
did.
i
thought
it
involved
the
limitation
on
vessel
owners'
liability
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
lessening
of
that
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no,
i
think
it
prohibited
lessening
of
a
vessel's
liability,
and
the
conclusion
of
the
case
that
making
you
go
to
another
court
did
not
constitute
a
lessening
of
the
vessel's
liability,
which
is
i
think
exactly
what's
going
on
here,
except
that
it's
another
state
instead
of
a
foreign
country,
but
you
have
to
travel
a
long
way.
i
guess
we'd
have
to
say
it's
okay
so
long
as
it's
a
foreign
country
that's
no
further
away
than
florida
was
from...
where
did
he
buy
the
ticket?
oregon.
washington.
it
was
the
west
coast
somewhere.
that's
a
long
distance.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your
response
to
the
point
made
in
footnote
25
of
the
respondents'
brief,
which
says
the
cogsa
contains
the
same
kind
of
an
exemption,
namely
it
says
that
neither
the
carrier
nor
the
ship
shall
be
responsible
for
loss
or
damage
arising
or
resulting
from
(i)
act
or
omission
of
the
shipper
or
owner
of
the
goods,
his
agent
or
representative.
why
wouldn't
that
cover
the
exact
situation
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
say
the
faa
does
not
apply
to
any
boilerplate
provisions
in
contracts,
only
to
hammered
out,
negotiated
arbitration
provisions?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
you
just
said,
that
this
was
not
negotiated.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
that
means
that
an
arbitration
clause
that
is
null
and
void
under
a
rule
prohibiting
arbitration
is
unaffected
by
the
faa?
that
would
sort
of
make
the
faa
useless.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
what
about
this
law
question?
there's
a
square
disagreement
between
you
and
counsel
on
the
other
side
as
to
whether
japanese
law
is,
indeed,
different
from
cogsa.
what
did
the
lower
court
assume
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
making
the
argument
here
that
you're
a
fortiori
entitled
to
win
if
they
are
the
same,
and
in
order
to
sustain
that
argument,
we
have
to
make
a
finding
about
whether
they're
different
or
the
same,
which
hasn't
been
made.
