mr.
mcdermott,
isn't
it
an
anomaly
that
in
cogsa
we
are
modeling
our
domestic
law
on
an
international
model...
the
whole
purpose
of
it,
wasn't
it,
of
the
hague
rules,
was
to
achieve
greater
uniformity
in
these
bills
of
lading...
and
then
to
say
we,
on
the
substantive
side
we're
trying
to
get
greater
uniformity
within
the
international
shipping
community,
and
then
say,
but
we
don't
trust
foreign
fora?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
this
venue
entirely
unrelated
to
the
voyage?
it
was
japanese
interests
that
owned
and
operated
the
ship,
was
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
your
position
be
different
if
the
place
for
arbitration
was,
say,
morocco?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
how
would
it
be...
let's
take...
i
thought
your
position
was,
any
place
other
than
the
united
states
is
no
good.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
then
why
are
you
responding
differently
to
morocco
versus
tokyo,
or,
say,
spain,
where
the
insurer
is
from,
versus
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
these
all
build
from
the
indussa
case
that
was
in
1967.
the
world
commercially
has
become
smaller.
we
have
become
less
provincial
with
regard
to
arbitration,
and
even
judicial
proceedings
in
other
places.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
like
the
cruise
line
in--
--exactly.
--what's
the
name
of
the
case?
carnival
cruise.
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
said
that...
you
had
a
witness
to
say
that
the
japanese
law,
which
is,
or
at
least
purports
to
be
modeled
on
the
hague
rules
just
like
cogsa,
you
had
a
witness
on
your
side
saying
the
japanese
law
is
different.
was
there
a
witness
on
the
other
side
saying
the
japanese
law
is
the
same?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
no
finding
was
made
to
that
effect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
should
we
take
a
different
view
of
the
bill
of
lading
than,
say,
for
example
the
contract
ticket
that
the
passenger
certainly
had
no
say
in
negotiating,
as
far
as
the
relevance
of
this
being
a
one-sided
contract,
a
take-it-or-leave-it
contract?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
said
we'll
assume
that
arguendo.
they
first
went
through
a
discussion
of
why
they
thought
indussa
was
probably
passe.
didn't
they
do
that
first?
and
then
they
said,
but
we'll
just
assume,
and
then
go
on
with
the...
put
the
two
in
conflict,
but
didn't
they
give
a
pretty
strong
signal
that
they
didn't
think
that
cogsa
was
in
conflict?
wasn't
that
the
thrust
of
the
whole
first
part
of
their
opinion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
everything
preceding,
notwithstanding
the
arguably
tremulous
ground
on
which
indussa
and
its
progeny
currently
sit,
and
we
had
pages
referring
to
carnival
cruise
and
to
bremen...
isn't
the
first
circuit
saying,
we
think
that
the
way
is
paved
by
carnival
cruise
and
bremen,
but
even
if
we're
wrong
about
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--might.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
1970
change
to
ratify
the
convention
on
enforcement
of
foreign
arbitral
awards?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
arbitration
per
se.
if
the
arbitration
were
in
the
united
states,
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
must
be
in
the
united
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
perhaps
we
should--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--concentrate
on
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked.
i
have
the
same
concern.
usually
we
try
to
avoid
conflict,
not
to
make
conflict,
and
the
first
circuit
seemed
to
be
going
down
the
line
that
there's
nothing
inconsistent
about
this
bill
of
lading
provision
with
cogsa,
and
then
it
switched
gears
and
said,
well,
we'll
assume
conflict.
but
why
should
we
assume
conflict?
why
shouldn't
we
first
see
if
there
really
is
any
conflict
with
cogsa,
and
on
that
score,
is
judge
friendly
still...
is
he
really
off
for
modern
times?
it
does
cost
something
to
ship
everybody
to
japan
when
the
relevant
evidence
is
in
the
united
states.
