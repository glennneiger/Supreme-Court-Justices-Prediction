justice
anthony
m.

--suppose
the
parties
agree
by
a
separate
bill
of
lading
simply
to
supersede
and
ignore
the
provisions
of
cogsa,
and
then
that
contract
is
sought
to
be
enforced
in
a
court,
in
the
united
states
district
court.
it
take
it
then
cogsa
operates
to
revoke
that
superseding
contract.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
under
the
federal
arbitration
act,
although
under
section
2,
referring
to
the
arbitrability
of
maritime
contracts,
the
last
clause
says
that
you
cannot
arbitrate...
that
you
must
arbitrate
save
upon
such
grounds
as
exists
at
law
and
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract,
can
you
argue
here
that
what
the
petitioners
are
asserting,
that
there's
grounds
to
revoke
the
provision
in
the
bill
of
lading
that
superseded
cogsa?
isn't
that
a
ground
that
exists
at
law
and
equity
for
the
revocation
of
the
contract
under
section
2
of
the
arbitration
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
faa
has
a
specific
exception:
save
upon
such
grounds
as
exist
at
law
or
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract,
and
i
assume
that
would
be
the
revocation
of
any
part
of
a
contract.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
doesn't
that
operate
to
restore
cogsa,
then?
justice
anthony

kennedy
this
case
begin
in
massachusetts
district
court
when
owner
damaged
cargo
and
the
owner’s
marine
insurers
sued
the
ship
and
its
owners
the
allegation
was
about
over
a
$1
million
where
the
oranges
and
lemons
have
been
damaged,
when
they
were
loaded
in
an
improper
way.
the
shipment
was
from
morocco
where
the
fruits
was
loaded
or
misloaded
to
massachusetts.
the
contract
of
carriage
is
astandard
form
standard
form
of
ocean
bill
of
lading
the
dispute
is
over
one
of
the
clauses
in
the
bill
of
lading.
it
provides
damage
claims
will
be
subject
to
arbitration,
there
is
no
dispute
over
that
it
goes
on
to
provide
that
the
arbitration
will
be
in
tokyo
and
will
proceed
under
japanese
law,
there
is
a
dispute
over
that.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
the
arbitration
to
proceed
as
provided
in
the
bill
of
lading
and
the
first
circuit
affirmed.
the
cargo
owner
and
the
marine
insurers
object
to
these
rulings.
they
are
the
petitioners
here
and
we
now
affirm.
the
petitioner
argues
that
the
arbitration
clause
can
not
be
enforced
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
because
it
is
contrary
to
another
federal
law
the
so
called
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
and
the
acronym
for
that
is
cogsa.\
cogsa
has
a
provision
that
renders
null
and
void
any
term
in
the
bill
of
lading
which
lessens
the
liability
that
cogsaotherwise
provides
in
the
petitioner’s
view
the
additional
cost
and
inconvenience
of
going
to
japan
and
arbitrating
under
japanese
law
lessens
the
liability
in
the
sense
this
prohibited
back
by
cogsa
and
we
hold
that
a
foreign
arbitration
clause
does
not
per
se
lessen
liability
under
cogsa.
cogsa
sets
out
certain
duties
and
obligations
that
are
carried
and
may
not
alter
to
its
advantage
in
the
bill
of
lading,
but
it
does
not
identify
the
particular
procedures
or
the
form
for
enforcing
these
obligations.
that’s
the
fact
that
a
form
maybe
more
costly
and
less
convenient,
for
a
shipper
does
not
lessen
liability
as
those
terms
are
used
in
cogsa,
our
reading
is
consistent
with
principles
of
international
committee
their
implicit
in
the
hague
rules
and
it
is
the
hague
international
convention
on
which
cogsa
in
fact
is
modeled.
it
also
accords
with
the
way
other
nations
that
have
ratified
the
hague
rules
have
interpreted
their
international
obligations.
the
petitioner
also
argues
that
the
arbitration
clause
lessens
liability
when
combined
with
japanese
choice
of
law
clauses
because
the
japanese
version
of
the
hague
rule
as
the
petitioner
interprets
it
release
the
respondent
for
certain
negligent
conduct
that
would
be
remedy
done
at
cogsa.
we
need
not
to
address
that
argument
at
this
interlocutory
stage
because
the
arbitrators
will
decide
the
choice-of-law
question
in
the
first
instance.
for
these
reasons
we
affirm
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
justice
breyer
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision.
