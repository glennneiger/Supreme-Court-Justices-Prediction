justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
hypothetical
question?
supposing
the
bill
of
lading
contained
an
arbitration
clause,
and
the
clause
said
that
there
shall
be
no
liability
without
proof
of
wilful
and
wanton
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
carrier,
and
the
arbitrator
shall
decide
whether
there
is
or
not,
would
that
be
enforceable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
left
of
cogsa,
then?
if
you
put
an
arbitration
clause
in
and
it
says
in
it,
none
of
the
provisions
of
cogsa
shall
apply
to
this
transaction,
and
the
arbitrator
shall
do
it
under
some...
and
they
set
out
a
set
of
rules
that
would
govern
this
arbitration.
that
would
be
perfectly
all
right,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what's
unfair
about
it?
the
parties
can
read
the
agreement
before
they
sign
it.
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
fundamental
unfairness
if
the
terms
are
explicit
in
the
arbitration
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maximum
liability,
$100
for
each
ton
of
goods,
or
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
whole
premise
of
cogsa
is
that
you
don't
have
time
for
knowledge
and
negotiation
in
advance,
because
you
have
these
transactions
taking
place
with
time
considerations
and
all
the
rest,
and
there's
some
interest
in
uniformity
that
cogsa
was
intended
to
serve.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
under
your
view,
all
of
that
could
be
agreed
to
not
be
followed
in
a
particular
shipping
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
assume
all
people
who
own...
make
million
dollar
purchases
of
oranges
are
pretty
sophisticated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your
case
would
be...
your
legal
position
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
nobody
ever
was
within
400,000
miles
of
japan.
that's
an
exaggeration.
your
case
would
be
the
same
if
all
the
witnesses
were
local
people
in
boston.
justice
john
paul
stevens
some
of
whom
might
not
really
want
to
go
to
tokyo
to
testify
for
15
minutes
in
some
kind
of
an
arbitration.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
may
well
be,
as
a
practical
matter,
much
more
difficult
to
prove
the
liability
if
you
have
to
go
10,000
miles
to
a
distant
forum
than
if
you
do
it
right
where
everybody's
right
at
home.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
just
assuming...
my
hypothetical
is
everybody
lives
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
boston
in
my
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
and
they
still,
under
your
view
they
still--
[laughter]
--have
to
go
to
tokyo,
and
even
if
the
law
is
radically
different,
there's
still
no...
the
arbitration
agreement
is
still
enforceable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
will
argue
it's
not
different
because
of
the
international
convention,
but
i
don't
think
that's
essential
to
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
not
sure
how
you
get
around
justice
kennedy's
concern
that
the
cogsa
says,
in
so
many
words,
if
you
have
different
terms
in
a
bill
of
lading
than
those
the
statute
requires,
that
bill
of
lading
is
null
and
void,
and
you're
saying
well,
we
can
write
a
different
bill
of
lading
as
long
as
we
have
an
arbitration
clause.
that
to
me
is
hard
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you'd
also
say--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
applying
a
different
nation's
law
does
not
lessen
liability,
either.
you
say
that,
as
i
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
by
doing
that
it
said
we
can
assume
arguendo
that
it's
different,
and
we
still
will
require
arbitration,
and
if
your
position
depends
on
them
being
the
same,
then
there
is
not
a
necessary
finding
that
they
are
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're...
and
under
the
court
of
appeals
rationale,
you're
entitled
to
win,
even
if
they're
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
said,
we
don't
have
to
decide
it.
