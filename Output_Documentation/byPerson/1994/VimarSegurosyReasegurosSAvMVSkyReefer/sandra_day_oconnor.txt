mr.
mcdermott,
is
japan
a
signatory
to
the
hague
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
we
know
whether
japan's
law
differs
significantly
from
u.s.
law
with
regard
to
liability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
and
in
any
event,
even
if
it
were
arbitrated
in
japan,
would
the
case
remain
in
the
district
court
for
purposes
of
ultimate
review
under
whatever
the
standard
is
of
review
for
arbitration?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
if...
unless
we
think
that
holding
the
arbitration
in
another
country
lessens
the
liability,
cogsa
just
doesn't
invalidate,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
question
is
whether
the
mere
location
of
the
arbitration...
setting
aside
any
choice
of
law
question
to
be
applied,
the
mere
holding
of
the
arbitration
in
japan
somehow
lessens
the
liability
of
the
carrier?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
walsh,
i
have
some
difficulty,
frankly,
with
your
approach,
and
i
wonder
why
we
shouldn't
just
look
at
cogsa
and
see
what
it
prohibits
and
what
it
doesn't
prohibit,
and
ask
whether
cogsa
prohibits
the
holding
of
the
arbitration
proceeding
in
japan,
does
it
lessen
the
liability
of
the
carrier
to
have
the
arbitration
held
in
japan,
without
looking
at
the
moment
at
the
choice
of
law
issue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
was
certainly
the
thrust
of
judge
friendly's
approach
in
that
indussa
case,
but
you
say
that's
been
somehow
changed
over
the
course
of
the
intervening
years.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
presumably
cogsa
was
adopted
in
conformance
with
the
hague
rules.
