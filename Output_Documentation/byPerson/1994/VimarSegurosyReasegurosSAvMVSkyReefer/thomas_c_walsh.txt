mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
is
apparent,
i
believe,
we
strongly
believe
the
faa
is
the
dominant
statute
here
and
overrides
any
provisions
in
cogsa.
when
this
transaction
commenced,
bacchus
associates,
the
assured
of
vimar,
entered
a
contract
with
galaxie,
a
moroccan
supplier,
and
they
purchased
a
shipload
of
oranges.
in
that
transaction,
they
obtained
a
bill
of
lading,
a
negotiable
bill
of
lading,
which
was
issued
by
the
shipowner--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
it
as
delivered
to
galaxie,
your
honor,
and
in
turn
galaxie,
as
part
of
the
sale
contract
with
bacchus,
delivered
the
bill
of
lading
to
bacchus.
bacchus
and
their
assurance
company
were
never,
in
reality,
in
direct
contact
on
the
bill
of
lading
with
the
shipowner.
they
took
that
bill
of
lading
as
part
of
the
purchase
contract
for
the
oranges
from
galaxie.
the
shipowner
did
what
he
is
supposed
to
under
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
he
issued
a
bill
of
lading
and
he
delivered
it
to
the
shipper,
galaxie.
in
the
context
of
its
transaction
with
galaxie,
we
believe
that
bacchus
could
have
negotiated
for
any
bill
of
lading
it
wished.
galaxie...
strike
that.
bacchus
also
entered
a
contract
for
the
use
of
the
vessel.
bacchus
was
not
simply
the
purchaser
of
the
fruit.
bacchus
also
arranged
for
a
vessel,
the
sky
reefer,
to
perform
a
single
voyage
charter
from
agadir,
morocco,
to
new
bedford,
massachusetts.
that
contract
with
the
time
charter
of
the
vessel
assumedly
made
a
profit
for
bacchus,
was
economically
more
desirable
than
simply
having
galaxie
deliver
the
fruit
to
new
bedford,
and
that
clause
which...
that
contract,
voyage
charter
which
bacchus
negotiated
with
the
time
charter
of
the
vessel,
contained
an
arbitration
clause.
bacchus
contends...
complains
about
arbitration
clauses,
and
yet
in
that
instance
they
negotiated
and
accepted
one.
we
believe
those
are
relevant
factors,
and
that
the
bill
of
lading
which
was
used
here,
a
negotiable
bill
of
lading
in
essentially
a
normal
commercial
sense,
would
be
exactly
the
type
of
ocean
bill
of
lading
which
is
referred
to
in
the
federal
arbitration
act,
which
says
ocean
bills
of
lading
are
valid
and
enforceable
when
they
contain
arbitration
clauses.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
believe
it
would,
your
honor,
it
would
before
the
arbitrators.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
at
some
point,
your
honor,
i
believe
you
reach
a
stage
of
what
has
been
called
fundamental
unfairness,
or
is
not
fundamentally
fair.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
your
honor,
if
you
assume
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--if
you
assume...
your
honor,
if
you
assume
sophisticated
traders,
and
you
assume
knowledge
and
negotiation,
it
is
difficult--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
your
honor,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
cogsa
that
does
not
have
to
do
with
the
arbitration
clause,
and
does,
in
the
normal
course
of
events,
reflecting
the
hague
convention,
which
is
what
it
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--between
sophisticated
individuals,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
the
case.
they
are--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
they're--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--your
honor,
i
believe
you
can
get
to
fundamental
unfairness
in
the
sense
of
geography,
in
the
sense
of
foreign
law
statutes...
for
example,
if
you
assume
there
was
a
country
where
we
were
sending
someone
to
arbitrate
and
the
law
in
that
country
provided
that
anyone
awarding
a
judgment
in
favor
of
an
american
would
be
disenfranchised,
that
would
be
fundamentally
unfair.
there
is
no
reasonable...
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
arbitration
would
be
done
in
a
fair
fashion.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
and
i
believe--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
we
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
it
does
not
lessen
if
you
reach
that
issue.
we
submit
that
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
congress
would
intend
that
we
be,
in
the
context
of
lessening,
measuring
air
fares
and
hotel
bills
in
arbitrations.
we
do
not
believe
that
is
reasonable.
we
don't
believe
that's
what
anyone
meant.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
think
in
large
part,
your
honor,
it's
simply
the
passage
of
time
and
the
changes
in
air
fares
and
transportations
and
faxes,
and
things
that
we
deal
with
in
the
commercial
world,
that
has
resulted
in
a
different
attitude,
and
perhaps
that
was
appropriate
then,
and
perhaps
it
is
not
now.
in
respect
to
the
law
that
was
applied,
we
do
believe
that
the
hague
rules
would
be
applied
in
this
arbitration
either
by
japanese
law
or
by
cogsa,
they
being...
both
statutes
being
essentially
incorporations
of
the
same
convention.
now,
they
do
differ,
we
believe,
in
somewhat
minor
words,
and
one
obviously
has
been
translated
from
english
to
japanese
and
back
to
english,
so
there
is
some--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
we
understand
that
the
japanese
hague
rules,
japanese
equivalent,
was
also
done
in
that
fashion.
there
are
some
differences,
in
part
cultural
differences.
our
statute,
for
example,
refers
to
act
of
god.
the
japanese
refers
to
supervening
incidents
of,
something
of
that
nature.
in
any
translation,
if
you
will,
of
a
convention
i
would
submit
that
there
will
be
some
minor
changes,
and
that
is,
we
believe,
what
you
see
in
this
situation
and
not
a
major
change
in
the
liability.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
structure
is
the
same.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
believe
that's
true,
your
honor.
the
district
court--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--i
believe
that
was
intended,
your
honor,
to
deal
with
fraud,
duress,
and
things
of
that
nature.
to
the
extent...
excuse
me.
is
it
not
circular,
your
honor?
to
the
extent
it
violates...
it
does
not
violate
cogsa
because
the
faa
dominates,
then
it
is
acceptable.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
would
assume
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
don't...
at
the
moment
i
can't
think
of
the
answer,
your
honor,
although
i
had
it
earlier.
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--the...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
it
does
cost
something,
but
in
this
case
it
is
not
as
if
your
entire
evidence
is
in
the
united
states.
you
have
crew
members
from
the
vessel
whose
home
is
in
japan.
you
have
a
vessel
owner
who
has
contact
with
japan.
you
have
evidence
you
would
expect
from
morocco
as
to
the
packaging
of
the
goods.
that
will
undoubtedly
be
an
issue.
you
have
evidence
from
morocco
as
to
the
stowage
of
the
goods--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that
is
true,
your
honor,
and
they
might
decide
not
to
go,
and
there
might
be
a
change
in
the
agreement
at
that
point.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
cannot
quickly
tell
you
whether
it's
further
from
morocco
to
tokyo
than
morocco
to
new
york.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--if
everyone
lives
in
boston,
your
honor,
no
one
will
want
to
travel.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind,
your
honor,
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
arbitration,
a
totally
different
vehicle
than
litigation.
it
has
benefits.
it
is
more
efficient
in
some
ways
than
litigation.
it
is
prompt.
it
is...
there
are
some
good
things
about
it,
but
there
are
also
some
detriments.
the
law
may
not
be
applied
in
as
meticulous
a
fashion.
the
review
may
not
be
as
detailed.
it
is
a
tradeoff,
and
what
we
believe
is
that
arbitration
in
this
day
and
age
should
be
encouraged,
and
that
under
the
federal
arbitration
act,
referring
to
bills
of
lading,
this
is
what
they
meant.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
my
belief
is
that
there's
nothing
in
cogsa,
your
honor,
which
says
i
cannot
put
an
arbitration
clause
in
a
bill
of
lading.
it
says
i
cannot,
if
you
read
it
that
way,
lessen
the
liability.
we
don't
believe
that
arbitration
lessens
the
liability.
to
lessen
liability,
your
honor,
we
would
have
to
take
a
standard,
cost
and
other
things,
which
we
would
say
is
litigation,
deduct
from
that
the
cost
which
would
be
arbitration--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--and
also
say
it's
greater
or
lesser.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
your
honor.
while
that
is
probably
not
necessary
for
this
case
in
its
present
status,
yes,
i...
that's
true.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
lower
court,
my
recollection
is,
your
honor,
simply
said
that
issue's
not
before
us.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
our
position
does
not
depend
on
it
being
the
same.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
your
honor.
the
district
court--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
and
the
district
court
here
with
the
security
posted
retains
jurisdiction
until
this
matter
is
finally
ended.
i
believe
that
we
have
covered
most
of
the
matters
which
were
relevant
this
morning.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
simply
forego
the
rest
of
my
time.
