mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
concerns
a
perceived
conflict
between
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
and
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
case
arises
from
the
sale
of
a
cargo
of
oranges
which
was
shipped
from
morocco
to
massachusetts.
petitioners
subrogated
underwriter
of
the
purchaser
of
the
cargo,
and
respondents
are
the
vessel
owner
and
the
ship
in
rem.
among
the
commercial
documents
that
the
purchaser
received
from
the
shipper
when
it
purchased
the
cargo
was
an
ocean
bill
of
lading
that
the
vessel's
agents
had
issued
to
the
shipper
in
morocco.
included
in
the
fine
print
boilerplate
clauses
of
the
bill
of
lading
was
a
japanese
law
clause
and
a
tokyo
arbitration
clause.
the
purchaser
first
had
notice
of
these
clauses
when
it
received
the
bill
of
lading
from
its
bank,
after
it
had
paid
for
the
goods.
by
that
time,
the
bill
of
lading
terms
were
fait
accompli.
when
the
cargo
arrived
damaged
in
massachusetts,
petitioner
filed
suit
in
the
district
of
massachusetts.
respondents
moved
under
chapter
1
of
the
faa
to
stay
the
case
pending
arbitration
in
tokyo.
petitioner
opposed
the
motion
on
the
grounds
that
the
foreign
arbitration
clause
was
invalid
as
a
prohibited
lessening
of
the
carrier's
liability
under
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
yes,
it
is.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
as...
in
this
case,
we
believe
it
does,
because
we
do
not
believe
that
the
japanese
hague
rules
impose
on
the
vessel
owner
the
nondelegable
obligation
to
load
and
stow
the
cargo
carefully.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
no.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
well,
the
district
court
would
retain
jurisdiction
of
the
case,
not
least
because
it
has
in
rem
jurisdiction
over
the
ship,
so
there
is
always
the
opportunity,
after
the
arbitration
in
japan
were
concluded,
to
come
back
to
the
court
here
and,
for
one
reason
or
another,
if
there
had
been
manifest
disregard
of
the
law,
for
example,
to
seek
vacation
of
the
award.
what
the
first
circuit
did,
in
answer
to
justice
souter's
question,
was
simply
defer
the
issue
of
what
choice
of
law
the
arbitrators
would
apply.
however,
it
is
petitioners'
position
that
there
is
simply
no
choice
of
law
issue
in
this
case,
because
cogsa
itself
applies
to
all
bills
of
lading
in
united
states
trade,
and
this
court
decided
almost
100
years
ago
in
the
knott
case
that
choice
of
law
clause
in
bills
of
lading
are
invalid,
because
they
are
directly
in
contravention
of
the
express
enacting
provisions
then
of
the
harter
act,
today
of
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
the
enacting
clause
of
cogsa,
section
1300,
says,
the
american
cogsa,
this
act
shall
apply
to
all
bills
of
lading
in
united
states
trade,
and
given
that
congressional
directive,
that
japanese
law
clause
in
this
bill
of
lading
was
null
and
void,
and
what
petitioner--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--yes.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
that
may
be
the
result,
but
here,
respondents'
own
expert,
a
japanese
lawyer,
has
stated
in
an
affidavit
that
the
japanese
hague
rules
would
be
applied
in
this
arbitration
if
conducted
in
japan.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
no,
we
do
not
have
a
case
where
it
is
identical,
but
we
do
have
in
this
case
a
statute
which
says
that
cogsa,
this
cogsa
applies
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
it's
not
so
much
an
issue
of
trust,
justice
ginsburg.
the...
what
congress
did
when
it
enacted
cogsa
was
yes,
to
model
our
cogsa
to
the
american
cogsa
on
the
hague
rules,
but
it
nevertheless
said
that
our
statute
shall
apply
to
bills
of
lading
in
united
states
trade,
and
yes,
it
is
true
that
it
brought
uniformity
to
international
commerce,
but
that
did
not
give
the
courts
here
in
the
united
states
license
to
disregard
what
is
our
statute,
and
all
of
the
jurisprudence
which
has
been
developed
over
the
last
60
years
which
supports
what
our
interpretation
of
cogsa
is.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
well,
lessening...
lessening
has
multiple
aspects.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
well,
first
of
all
the
wesermunde
decision
in
the
eleventh
circuit.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
not
from
the
supreme
court,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
yes,
but
only
in
the
context
of
a
freely
negotiated--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--yes,
provided,
however,
that
you
do
not
have
what
this
court
decided
in
knott
almost
100
years
ago,
which
was
an
express
declaration
that
foreign
law
cannot
be
applied
in
a
case
dealing
with
a
bill
of
lading
governed
then
by
the
harter
act.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
relieving
in
the
harter
act.
today
in
cogsa
it's
relieving
or
lessening.
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
which
have
addressed
the
analogous
provision,
which
is
a
foreign
jurisdiction
clause,
which
inevitably
is
tied
to
a
foreign
law
clause,
have
concluded
that
it
is
a
prohibited
lessening
of
the
carrier's
liability
to
force
the
cargo
owner
to
go
to
a
remote
jurisdiction
in
a
venue
that
almost
always
is
entirely
unrelated
to
the
voyage,
and
often
under
color
of
a
foreign
law.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
yes,
but
the
cargo
was
lifted
in
morocco;
it
was
shipped
and
discharged
in
massachusetts.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
depending
upon
the
law,
it
would
be
different.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
that
is
correct.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
well,
i
didn't
intend
to
respond
differently.
the
petitioners'
position
is,
any
forum
which
is
outside
the
united
states
is
invalid
under
cogsa,
because
it
imposes
burdens,
it
imposes
hardships,
and
it
creates
unacceptable
risks
that
the
law
which
will
be
applied
will
not
be
the
controlling
united
states
law.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
we
don't
believe
so,
because
the
burdens
of
going
half-way
around
the
world,
dragging
your
witnesses
half-way
around
the
world,
are
very
formidable
and
they
still
remain
quite
significant.
it
is
one
thing
to
have
what
we've
traditionally
had
in
the
united
states,
namely
60
years
of
cargo
practice
where,
in
a
case
such
as
this,
where
the
cargo
is
damaged
in
massachusetts,
where
all
the
witnesses
are
located,
where
all
the
evidence
can
be
readily
assembled,
where
the
case
can
be
handled
quickly
and
expeditiously--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--we--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--no,
we
don't...
arbitration
in
the
united
states
is
materially
different
from
arbitration
abroad.
i
mean,
there
is
a
body
of
arbitrators,
for
example,
here
in
the
united
states,
who
are
familiar--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--not
a
gross
difference,
but
there
are
transaction
costs
abroad
which
will
inevitably
be
greater
than
the
cost
of
presenting
a
claim
here
in
the
united
states.
there
are
witnesses
who
will
have
greater
difficulty
traveling
abroad
to
give
testimony
than
they
would
here
in
the
united
states.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
because
of
the
deterrent
effect
of
a
foreign
arbitration,
or
a
foreign
litigation,
or
any--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--there
are...
it
is
a
different
argument.
on
one
hand
there
are
what
i
call
the
transaction
costs.
that
deals
with
the
burdens
that
are
placed
on
a
claimant
to
produce
the
witnesses
and
the
evidence
necessary
to
support
it's
claim.
there
is
also
the
risks
that
when
you
get
to
that
foreign
forum,
there
will
be
a
different
law
that
will
be
applied,
not
the
law
which
congress
says
shall
govern
any
claim
brought
under
this
bill
of
lading,
and
in
combination,
that
amounts
to
a
lessening.
all
of
the
courts
of
appeal
which
have
looked
into
this
issue
have
concluded
that
in
fact
it
is,
from
a
practical
perspective,
a
lessening
to
force
someone--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--that
is
true,
but
what
is
also
equally
provincial,
if
not
more
so,
what
is
equally
parochial,
if
not
more
so,
is
the
insistence
of
foreign
carriers
that
they
be
sued
only
in
their
home
jurisdictions,
under
color
of
their
laws.
what
these
bill
of
ladings
clause
represents
is
the
carrier's
insistence,
without
negotiation--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--well,
carnival
cruise
lines
first
of
all
did
not
deal
with
a
statute
such
as
cogsa,
which
governs
the
substantive
rights
of
the
parties
to
the
contract,
in
this
instance
to
the
bill
of
lading.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
well,
that
act
applied
to
the
measure
of
damages,
and
it
prohibited
any--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--no,
their
right
to
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
the
lessening
language
in
the
second
section
of
the
limitation
of
liability
act
which
was
at
issue
in
carnival
cruise
line
simply
prohibited
a
clause
in
a
ticket
contract
that
reduced
or
lessened
access
to
a
federal
court.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
without,
of
course,
adding
to
the
problem
we
have
here
of
a
provision
which
would
change
the
law
that
applies,
and
which
would
remove
all
guarantees
that
the
cogsa,
which
is
the
american
enactment
that
requires
it
be
applied
to
this
bill
of
lading,
be
enforced.
if
you
go...
if
a
japanese
carrier,
as
in
this
case,
puts
a
japanese
law
and
arbitration
clause,
it
removes
all
guarantees,
apart
from
the
additional
transaction
costs.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
the
japanese
lawyer
whose
affidavit
is
in
the
record
simply
said
that
the
japanese
hague
rules
would
be
applied
to
the
arbitration.
it
is
our
position,
when
you
compare
the
japanese
hague
rules
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law,
to
cogsa,
when
you
focus
on
section
3(2),
which
is
the
provision
which
pertains
to
the
vessel
owner's
obligation
to
load
and
stow
the
cargo,
there
is
a
manifest
difference
between
the
two,
and
there
would
be
a
lessening
of
the
substantive
liability
under
the
japanese
hague
rules.
s--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--no,
absolutely
not.
the
merits
were
never
addressed
in
the
courts
below.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
that
deals
with
the
interplay
of
sections
3
and
4
of
cogsa
and
the
hague
rules.
the
authorities
that
were
cited
demonstrate
in
the
united
states
the
carrier
has
the
nondelegable
obligation
to
load
and
stow
the
cargo
even
if
that
cargo
is
loaded
and
stowed,
as
in
this
case,
by
stevedores
hired
by
the
shipper.
in
other
words,
the
carrier
simply
can't
delegate
entirely
to
the
shipper,
or
to
the
stevedores
hired
by
the
shipper,
the
responsibility
for
the
safety
of
the
cargo.
in
contrast,
the
japanese
hague
rules
impose
the
obligation
to
load
only
on
the
carrier
and
on
those
hired
by
him,
which
would
exclude
the
stevedores
in
this
case
hired
by
the
shipper,
so
the
construction
of
article
3,
which
is
independent
of
the
exception
which
justice
scalia
mentions
in
section
4,
does
create
a
significant
difference
between
the
japanese
law
and
the
united
states
law,
and
if
not
proven
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
judge
friendly
mentioned
in
indussa,
in
order
to
determine
if,
in
fact,
there
would
be
any
potential
change
in
the
law,
you
would
simply
have
experts
forecasting
what
a
court
might
or
might
not
do.
that
itself,
we
believe,
is
unacceptable
lessening
of
liability,
because
it
removes
the
glue
from
what
is
otherwise
a
bona
fide
claim
assertable
here
in
the
united
states,
and
what
the
first
circuit
did
not
do
on
the
merits,
if
you
conclude
that
in
fact
a
bill
of
lading
clause
providing
for
foreign
jurisdiction
is
invalid
under
cogsa,
is
a
lessening
of
liability,
it
did
not
seek
to
reconcile
the
two
statutes.
in
particular,
it
did
not
determine
whether
or
not
cogsa,
which
is
a
federal
law,
would
have
been
a
basis
under
the
savings
clause
in
section
2
of
the
faa
for
finding
that
the
bill
of
lading
clause
was
revocable,
and
what
it
was
the
obligation,
we
believe,
of
the
first
circuit
to
do,
is
attempt
to
reconcile
those
two
statutes,
not
simply
conclude,
as
the
first
circuit
did,
that
the
two
statutes
were
irreconcilably
in
conflict
and
then
just
pick
one
over
the
other,
in
this
case
the
faa.
if...
if
a
bill
of
lading
clause
is
invalid
under
cogsa,
if
it's
a
prohibited
lessening
of
liability
under
section
3(8),
it
is
then
revocable
at
law
within
the
meaning
of
the
savings
clause
of
section
2.
furthermore,
apart
from
the
literal
terms
of
the
savings
clause,
which
makes
these
two
statutes
textually
reconcilable,
the
policies
which
have
animated
this
court
in
its
decisions
on
the
federal
arbitration
act
don't
come
into
play
in
this
case,
because
there
is
no
meaningful
consent
in
bills
of
lading
to
any
of
the
bill
of
lading
terms.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
no,
that
is
not
our
position
at
all.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
that's
true,
but
the
faa
applies
technically,
but
in
terms
of
reconciling
the
two
statutes
to
see
whether
there
is
room
for
cogsa
to
remove
this
foreign
arbitration
clause
from
the
grasp
of
the
faa,
to
reverse
the
analogy
which
the
first
circuit
used,
which
said
that
the
faa
removed
the
foreign
arbitration
clause
from
the
grasp
of
cogsa,
you'd
have
to
examine
the
policies,
we
believe,
in
the
two
statutes,
and
the
policy
of
informed
consent,
which
has
animated
most
of
this
court's
decisions
concerning
arbitration,
doesn't
exist
in
a
case--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--well,
it's
not...
a
bill
of
lading
essentially
is
not
a
sophisticated
document
which
informed
businessmen
enter
into.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
well,
it's
a
form
bill
of
lading
which
is...
which
the
carrier
issues
at
ports
around
the
world
to
shippers
who
may
or
may
not
be
informed
of
what
that
bill
of
lading
represents.
that
document
is
then
transferred
incident
to
the
contract
of
sale.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
no.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
well,
we're
not
advocating
that
doctrine.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
that
in
terms
of
reconciling
the
two
statutes
cogsa
acquires
much
greater
force
in
weight
in
a
situation
where
the
foreign
arbitration
clause
wasn't
negotiated
in
any
sense,
and
where
the--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--because
in
the
case
of
bills
of
lading,
ocean
bills
of
lading
governed
by
cogsa,
freedom
of
contract
is
not
the
controlling
doctrine.
cogsa
is
a
statutory
overlay
which
is
imposed
on
the
bills
of
lading
because
it
is
a
given,
and
it
has
been
assumed
by
the
precedents
of
this
court
for
50
years,
that
bills
of
lading
are
contracts
of
adhesion,
and
because
they
are
contracts
of
adhesion,
it
is
not
a
private
contract
which
should
regulate
the
rights
of
the
parties.
rather,
it
is
the
statute
that
overrides
the
terms
in
the
con--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--that
is
not
in...
it
is
not
our
position
that
that
is
indispensable
to
the
application
of
the
faa
to
a
form
contract.
in
this
case,
however,
it
demonstrates
that
cogsa
and
the
policies
that
animate
cogsa
have
far
greater
weight
than
any
policy
that
would
support
the
application
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
that
is
true.
the
premise--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--that's
correct.
that
is
petitioner's
position,
and
that
is
the
position
that
the
lower
courts
of
appeals
have
reached
unanimously
in
examining
the
very
same
types
of
clauses
which
are
forum
selection
clauses,
foreign
litigation
clauses.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
faa
is
entirely
displaced
because
there
was
not
notice
and
opportunity
to
negotiate.
the
faa
in
sections
1
and
2
applied
to
bills
of
lading,
but
in
terms
of
demonstrating
whether
or
not
a
particular
bill
of
lading
clause
should
be
enforceable,
as
the
court
held
in
mitsubishi,
the
court
has
to
look
not
to
the
policies
behind
the
faa,
but
rather
to
the
policies
behind
the
other
statute.
and
the
other
statute
in
this
case
is
cogsa,
and
it's
the
congressional
intentions
in
the
other
competing
statutes
which
determine
whether
or
not
a
bill
of
lading
clause
should
be
enforced,
and
the
purpose
of
cogsa
is
to
invalidate
adhesionary
clauses
that
override
bill
of
lading
rights,
and
if
those
bill
of
lading
rights
have
not
been
negotiated,
then
there
is
no
reason
for
cogsa
not
to
apply
in
full
force,
and
that
is
petitioner's
position.
the...
what
the
first
circuit
did
was
simply
say,
the
faa
controls,
period.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
they
assumed
that
the
two
were
irreconcilably
in
conflict
and
therefore
they
applied
maxims
of
construction
to
choose
one
or
the
other.
they
went
on
to...
the
first
record
went
on
to
say
that
it
was
the
less
specific
statute,
cogsa
was
the
less
specific
statute,
which
we
think
is
wrong--
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
--with
the
proviso
of
footnote
5,
which
is
on
page
10a,
in
which
the
first
circuit
says,
we
recognize,
however,
that
absent
the
faa,
cogsa
might
operate
to
nullify
foreign
arbitration
clauses
and
bills
of
lading.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
might,
certainly,
but
what
the
first
circuit
was
clearly
recognizing
was
that
it
was
only
the
faa
which
salvaged
this
foreign
arbitration
clause,
and
that
conflict
between
the
two
statutes
was,
we
think,
resolved
incorrectly,
because
cogsa
is
clearly
the
more
specific
statute.
it
pertains
to
bills
of
lading
that
are
negotiable
title
documents,
which
are
the
documents
indispensable
to
the
international
sales
of
goods.
the
faa
applies
virtually
to
every
maritime
contract.
in
contrast,
congress
enacted
cogsa
for
the
specific
purposes
of
regulating
the
rights
of
parties
to
bills
of
lading,
and
cogsa
was
also
not,
as
the
first
circuit
found,
the
earliest
statute,
which
was
superseded
by
the
enactment
of
the
faa
as
positive
law
of
1947.
that
1947
enactment
was
never
intended
to
have
substantive
effect,
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
the
first
circuit
was
clearly
wrong
in
applying
an
early
or
later
maxim
of
statutory
construction.
the
controlling
maxim,
we
believe,
was
which
was
a
specific
statute,
whether
there
was
an
implied
repeal
of
cogsa,
and
clearly,
in
both
instances
we
think
the
first
circuit
came
out
the
wrong
way.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
well,
we
think
not.
it
wasn't
raised
below,
and
for
that
reason
we
don't
think
the
issue
is
before
the
court,
but
the
1970
convention
has
a
savings
clause
just
like
chapter
1
of
the
faa
does
in
section
2.
it
specifically
says,
in
article
3(2),
that
if
an
arbitration
agreement
is
null
and
void,
then
it
need
not
be
enforced,
and
an
arbitration
clause
rendered
null
and
void
by
cogsa
would
not
be
enforceable
even
under
the
convention
as
enacted
in
1970.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
well,
the
cogsa
is
not
a
statute
that
is
targeted
at
arbitration.
it
is
simply
a
statute
that
is
targeted
at
clauses
that
reduce
a
carrier's
liability,
but
what
the
first
circuit
essentially
did
here
was
to
elevate
an
arbitration
clause
above
any
other
provision
in
the
bill
of
lading
that
might
violate
cogsa.
what
congress
said
in
1925,
when
it
enacted
the
faa,
was
that
arbitration
clauses
should
not
be
on
any
higher
footing
than
any
other
contract
clause,
but
to
say,
as
the
first
circuit
did
here,
that
the
only
bill
of
lading
clause
which
can
be
enforceable,
even
if
it
violates
cogsa,
is
an
arbitration
clause,
is
to
give
an
arbitration
agreement
a
superiority
to
every
other
contract
clause
in
the
bill
of
lading.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
we
do
not
contend
that
that
lessening
of
liability
would
be
so
extreme
as
to
validate
the
clause.
it's
not
the
petitioner's
position
that
arbitration
per
se
is
contrary
to
cogsa,
nor
do
we
contend
that
cogsa
claims
can't
be
arbitrated.
they
certainly
can
be.
mr.
stanley
mcdermott,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
