mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
labeling
prohibition
bans
factual
information
that
is
concededly
truthful,
accurate,
and
not
misleading.
the
government's
assertion
that
congress
wanted
to
ban
even
accurate
information
in
order
to
deter
strength
wars
finds
no
support
in
the
text
of
the
act,
in
the
committee
reports,
the
senate
report
or
the
house
report,
in
the
floor
debates,
or
in
the
congressional
testimony.
congress'
articulated
and
only
concern
was
the
prevention
of
false
or
misleading
speech.
in
any
event,
two
courts
have
found
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
accurate
disclosure
of
alcohol
content
on
beer
labels
would
result
in
strength
wars.
to
the
contrary.
they
found
that
the
vast
majority
of
consumers
would
use
that
information
to
choose
moderate
or
low
strength
beers.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
even
if
it
were
clear
that
congress
thought
there
would
be
strength
wars,
and
i'll
return
to
that
in
a
moment,
because
there's
no
reason
to
think
congress
did,
it's
still
the
requirement
under
the
central
hudson
test
for
the
court
to
determine,
based
on
the
evidence,
whether
the
means
chosen
by
congress
would
actually
advance,
directly
and
materially,
that
goal.
in
this
case,
applying
the
central
hudson
test,
both
district
courts
found
there
was
no
evidence
that,
even
if
that
was
the
congressional
goal,
this
labeling
ban
would
further
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
there
could
be
some
degree
of
deference
to
congressional
findings
that
there
would
be
strength
wars,
but
in
this
case
there
were
no
congressional
findings
whatsoever,
and
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
and
even
the
legislative
history
of
the
precursor
faca
regulations,
you
will
find
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
was
the
least
bit
concerned
with
strength
wars.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
no,
not
at
all,
justice
scalia.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
justice
scalia,
it's
not.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
sable
case,
it
was
precisely
the
absence
of
any
congressional
findings
of
fact
that
resulted
in
the
striking
down
of
that
law
under
the
first
amendment.
the
only
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
in
terms
of
deference--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
if
congress
had
made
findings
of
fact,
then
there
would
be
an
argument
that
the
courts
should
show
some
deference
to
those
congressional
findings
of
fact.
it
should
never--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--you
simply
apply
the
central
hudson
test.
there's
no
congressional
finding
to
which
the
court
should
defer.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
why
statutes
are
subjected
to
judicial
review
under
the
central
hudson
test,
and
on
applying
the
central
hudson
test,
the
court
found
there
was
no
evidence...
no
evidence
that
in
fact
accurate
disclosure
of
alcohol
content
on
beer
labels
would
result
in
strength
wars.
and
to
return
to
your
question,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
those
concurrent
findings
of
fact
by
two
lower
courts
should
be
binding
here.
the
government
is
inappropriately
attempting
to
reargue
the
very
same
evidence
it
argued
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
essentially
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
i
realize
this
is
a
first
amendment
case,
but
the
court's
special
rule
for
de
novo
review
of
lower
court
findings
of
fact
in
first
amendment
cases
has
always
been
applied
in
cases
where
the
lower
court
findings
of
fact
were
against
the
first
amendment--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--it
is
truly
a
finding
of
fact,
your
honor.
there
were
witnesses
and
testimony
and
studies
and
hearings
on
the
empirical
question
of
whether
disclosure
of
alcohol
content
would
result
in
strength
wars,
and
the
evidence--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--as
of
the
present
time,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
there
was
no
congressional
determination
in
1934.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
there
was
no
congressional
presumption
in
1934.
the
point--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--yes,
absolutely,
your
honor,
it
could.
that's
not
this
case,
and
we
don't
need
to
show
that
in
this
case,
because
in
this
case
there
were
no
such
findings
in
1934.
if
you'll
look
at
the
congressional
hearings
and
the
faca
hearings,
you'll
find
that
the
sole
and
exclusive
concern
was
that
beer...
unlike
wine
and
spirits,
beer
should
not
be
sold
on
the
basis
of
alcohol
content
because
at
that
time
technologically
it
was
impossible
to
determine
accurately
the
alcohol
content
of
beer,
so
a
statement
that
this
beer
contains
3
percent,
4
percent,
5
percent,
was
inherently
likely
to
be
false
and
misleading.
that
was
not
true
with
respect
to
wine
and
spirits.
structurally,
the
fact
that
the
same
law
prohibits
disclosure
of
alcohol
content
of
beer
but
permits
and,
in
fact,
requires
alcohol
content
of
wine
and
spirits,
cannot
be
explained
if
strength
wars
was
the
objective,
but
can
be
explained
if
preventing
misleading
speech
was
the
objective.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
we
do
concede
that,
but
the
government
conceded
in
this
case
that
the
information
at
issue
in
this
case
is
accurate.
technology
has
changed.
it
is
now
as
possible
for
producers
of
beer
to
determine
the
alcohol
content
of
the
products
precisely,
as
it
is
for
producers
of
wines
and
spirits,
and
therefore
the
government
has
conceded
that
this
ban
cannot
be
defended
on
the
traditional
ground
for
defending
restrictions
on
commercial
speech,
namely
that
the
speech
would
be
false
or
misleading.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
hopefully
the
high
school
students
wouldn't
be
drinking
anything.
that
should
be
prohibited
under
the
general
law.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
there
was
actually
evidence
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
the
agency
itself
agrees,
that
there
is
a
substantial
market
overlap
in
the
markets
for
beer,
wine,
and
spirits.
that
is
why,
when
the
agency,
after
the
court
decisions
below,
issued
regulations
requiring
or
permitting
the
statement
of
alcohol
content
on
beer
labels,
it
required
that
it
be
stated
as
a
percentage
of
volume
precisely
so
that
consumers
could
compare
like
with
like,
could
compare
with
wine
and
spirits.
if
i
could
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
house
report,
which
mr.
kneedler
began
by
discussing,
that
passage
from
the
house
report
to
which
he
referred
is,
in
my
opinion,
taken
entirely
out
of
context.
the
house
report
does
say--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--yes.
i'm
reading
from
the
actual
house
report
itself,
which
is
page
143
of
the
house
report.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
house
report
states,
quote,
malt
beverages...
malt
beverages
should
not
be
sold
on
the
basis
of
alcohol
content
because
"attempts
to
sell
beer
and
other
malt
beverages
on
the
basis
of
alcoholic
content
are
attempts
to
take
advantage
of
the
ignorance
of
the
consumer.
"
now,
if
you
will
look
at
the...
that
house
report
was
under
the
chairmanship
of
representative
cullen.
when
representative
cullen
introduced
this
bill
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
at
the
congressional
record
for
1935,
page
11715,
he
explained
precisely
what
that
meant.
he
said,
quote,
that
the
bill
was
designed
"to
prevent
the
unfair
trade
activities
of
those
in
the
industry
who
chisel
and
take
advantage
of
the
ignorance
of
the
consumer
by
dishonest
labeling
and
advertising.
"
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
provisions
of
the
act
were
designed--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
he
surely
meant
that,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--we
don't
even
need
to
know
how
many
people
were
there
when
he
said
that,
your
honor,
because
the
house
report
itself,
and
the
senate
report
itself,
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
bill
is
to
prevent
fraud
and
deception.
and
the
reason
for
that
was
there
was
unrebutted
testimony...
everyone
agreed
that
in
1935
you
could
not
accurately
determine
the
content
of
malt
beverages,
but
you
could
of
wine
and
spirits.
that
is
structurally
why
congress
prohibited
disclosure
of
alcohol
content
for
beer
but
required
it
for
wine
and
spirits.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
that's
a
good
question,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i
don't
know
the
answer,
and
it's
not
in
the
record
when
that
became
possible,
but
it
is
undisputed
that
it
is
possible,
and
that
this
ban
cannot
be
defended
on
the
ground
of
preventing
false
and
misleading
speech.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy,
and
the
government
has
attempted
to
do
that
by
asserting
in
the
lower
courts
the
strength
wars
interest,
and
now
asserting
in
this
court
the
twenty-first
amendment
interest,
and
let
me
turn
to
those.
as
i've
noted,
empirically
the
lower
courts
found
there's
no
evidence
that
the
labeling
ban
would
further
the
strength
war
interest.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
dispute
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
the
government
could
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
deterring
strength
wars
if
that
means
deterring
people
from
continually
increasing
the
alcoholic
content
of
their
benefits.
i
do
not
dispute--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
it
clearly
doesn't
really
entertain
that
interest,
because
if
it
did--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
the
reason
we
don't,
your
honor,
is
that
structurally,
if
that
were
the
government's
interest,
why
would
congress
not
have
prevented
disclosure
of
alcohol
content
on
wines
and
spirits,
which
are
much
higher
content?
second,
if
that
were
the
government's
interest--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--oh,
i
understand
your
question
now,
justice
souter.
let
me
be
clear,
then.
i
do
not
dispute
that
the
government,
namely
the
executive
branch,
is
today
asserting
a
strength
war
interest.
i
take
that
as
given.
what
i
do
dispute
is
that
congress
in
1935
had
a
strength
war
interest
in
mind.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
agree
with
that--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
souter.
in
this
case,
that
interest,
the
strength
war
interest,
was
subjected
to
a
trial,
and
empirically
was
found
that
the
evidence,
the
labeling
ban,
did
not
further
the
government's
interest.
in
fact,
overall,
the
overall
effect
of
the
labeling
ban
is
actually
to
disserve
the
government's
asserted
interest
in
strength
wars.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that's
what
district
judges
are
required
to
do
under
the
central
hudson
test,
and
appropriately
so,
because
we're
talking
about
a
ban
on
speech
which
is
concededly
truthful,
accurate,
not
misleading,
and
important
to
consumers.
let
me
turn,
though,
to
the
question...
to
the
point
your
question
suggests.
even
assuming
that
this
law
did
marginally
advance
the
government's
strength
war
interest,
it
is
certainly
not
reasonably
tailored,
under
the
fourth
prong
of
the
central
hudson
test.
in
fact,
it
is
completely
unnecessary.
the
government
could
directly
and
more
effectively
achieve
both
its
strength
war
interests
and
its
twenty-first
amendment
interest
simply
by
limiting
the
alcohol
content
of
beer
except
in
states
that
permit
a
higher
limit.
the
government
has
actually
conceded
in
this
case
that
its
strength
war
objective
could
be
fully
satisfied
by
a
federal
alcohol
content
limit.
it
lamely
argues,
however,
that
such
a
federal
limit
would
be
inconsistent
with
its
twenty-first
amendment
interest.
that
is
plainly
not
so.
simply
by
providing
the
same
kind
of
state
override
for
a
federal
alcohol
limit
that
the
law
already
provides
for
the
labeling
ban,
the
government
could
directly
and
more
effectively
achieve
both
of
its
asserted
interests,
so
even
if
the
law
marginally
advanced
the
government's
interest,
it
surely
fails
the
reasonably
tailored
prong.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
justice
breyer,
you've
asked
two
questions.
let
me
try
to
answer
them.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
first,
the
government
has
described
the
first
question
you
asked
basically
as
its
border-crossing
argument.
the
argument
is
that
by
banning
labeling
or
advertising
in
states,
that
will
facilitate
the
interests
of
those
11
states
who
choose
a
state
law
to
limit
the
alcohol
content
of
beverages.
that
totally
ignores
the
fact
that
in
two-thirds
of
the
country,
state
law
permits
advertising.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
breyer,
we
have
not
challenged
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
we...
we--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--we--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--we
do
agree,
however,
with
your
honor,
and
we
said
in
our
brief,
that
in
our
view
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
that
both
the
labeling
ban
and
the
advertising
ban
only
apply
in
states
that
themselves
independently
prohibit
labeling
or
prohibit
advertising.
we
think
that's
the
proper
construction
of
the
statute,
though
we
haven't
challenged
the
contrary
construction.
but
even
if
we're
talking
about
a
law
that
parallels
state
law,
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
because
if
the
state
wanted
to
prohibit
accurate,
truthful
information
on
beer
labels
for
the
same
strength
war
objective,
then
on
the
record
in
this
case,
because
it
would
not
advance
that
objective
whatsoever,
that
would
violate
the
first
amendment.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well
first,
justice
breyer,
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
noted
in
one
of
his
questions,
this
is
a
federal
law,
and
the
twenty-first
amendment
gives
no
affirmative
power
whatsoever.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
let
me
turn--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--let
me
turn
to
that.
first
of
all,
it's
not
necessary,
but
even
if
it
were,
then
the
question
would
be,
could
a
state
for
these
same
reasons
ban
labeling
on
beer,
and
the
answer
is
no,
because
the
first
amendment
would
prohibit
it.
the
twenty-first
amendment,
as
this
court
ruled
in
crisp,
is
primarily
a
limitation
on
the
federal
government's
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
in
crisp,
this
court
said
the
twenty-first
amendment
does
not
authorize
the
states
to
ignore
their
obligations
under
the
other
provisions
of
the
constitution.
in
craig
v.
boren,
this
court
ruled
that
the
intermediate
scrutiny
test
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which
is
virtually
indistinguishable
from
the
commercial
speech
test
under
central
hudson,
was
not
lowered
or
lessened
even
in
a
state
case
because
of
the
presence
of
the
fourteenth...
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
it
would
be
astonishing
if
this
court
were
to
rule
that
for
some
reason
the
standard
of
review
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
lowered
because
of
the
twenty-first,
but
the
standard
of
review
under
the
first
amendment
is.
in
fact,
turning
to
the
first
amendment,
in
larkin
v.
grendel's
den,
this
court
has
already
held
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
does
not
lower
the
standard
of
review
under
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--and
there's
no
reason
why
it
should
lower
the
standard
of
review
under
the
free
speech
clause
of
the
same
first
amendment.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that
raises
a
much
more
difficult
and
quite
different
question.
i
know,
as
your
honor
wrote
in
posadas,
that
it
has
often
been
thought
there
is
a
common
sense
link,
without
the
need
for
evidence,
between
promotional
advertising
that
is
designed
to
increase
demand,
and
a
likelihood
that
it
will
increase
demand,
but
it's
a
vastly
different
situation
here.
we're
not
talking
about
promotional
advertising,
we're
talking
about--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i'm
happy
to
do
that.
i'm
happy
to
do
that,
your
honor.
it's
a
complicated
answer.
first
of
all,
it
depends
on
whether
you're
dealing
with
a
mature
market
or
not.
there's
a
great
deal
of
empirical
evidence
that
in
a
mature
market,
such
as
the
beer
market,
the
only
purpose,
the
only
effect
of
advertising
is
not
to
increase
overall
demand
but
to
shift
brand
loyalties.
but
putting
that
aside
for
the
moment,
we're
talking
here
about
a
particular
product
trait,
alcohol
strength.
there
is
no
common
sense
reason
to
believe
that
advertising
a
particular
product
trait
will
increase
consumer
demand
for
the
underlying
product.
that
depends
on
whether
consumers
want
that
trend
or
not.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
i
do
know
that
there
are
decisions
of
this
court
saying
that
states
cannot
categorically
ban
other
kinds
of
advertising,
price
advertising
of
drugs
in
virginia
state
board,
price
advertising
of
legal
services
in
bates.
it
would
depend
on
whether
application
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
authorized
a
state
to
ban
a
law
that
was
in
fact
designed
to
increase
demand.
that's
not
this
law
at
all.
whether
consumers
would
buy
beer
that's
higher
strength
or
lower
strength
is
an
empirical
question.
that
empirical
question
was
subjected
to
a
trial,
and
the
trial
courts
found
that
the
vast
majority
of
consumers
would
prefer
low
strength,
just
like,
if
you
subjected
it
to
a
trial,
probably
most
consumers
today
would
prefer
lower
sugar
content
in
children's
cereals
than
higher
sugar
content.
higher
is
not
necessarily
preferred.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
that's
a
question
that
i
haven't,
frankly,
thought
about,
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to.
i
do
know,
however,
that
the
way
that
question
would
be
answered
would
be
by
applying
the
central
hudson
test
and
deciding
whether
the
government
had
a
substantial
interest
in
shifting
consumer
demand
in
that
way,
substantial
and
legitimate
interest,
and
whether
the
law
would
advance
it.
that's
not
the
interest
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
in
fact,
justice
scalia
made
the
point
about
malt
liquor
in
one
of
your
questions.
it
is
true
that
this
law
already
permits
consumers
to
identify
the
highest
strength
products,
because
it
permits
the
use
on
the
label
and
in
advertising
of
the
term,
malt
liquor.
now,
mr.
kneedler
said
that
it's
only
some
years
ago
that
malt
liquor
came
to
be
known
as
the
highest
strength
malt
beverage,
but
if
you'll
look
at
the
1935
hearings
before
the
faca
regulations,
you
will
see
over
and
over
again
there
that
at
that
time
ale
was
thought
to
be,
and
known
to
be,
the
highest
strength
beer
product.
and
there
was
questioning
and
testimony
about
that,
and
the
chairman
and
every
witness
said,
it
is
okay
with
us
to
allow
you
to
use
the
word
ale,
as
long
as
it's
truthfully
ale,
even
though
that
means
that
consumers
will
know
which
are
the
highest
strength
products.
that
is
completely
inconsistent
with
any
concern
that
accurate
disclosure
of
factual
information
will
result
in
strength
wars.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
justice
scalia,
ale
is
a
malt
beverage,
but
it
is
produced
quite
differently
from
beer.
beer
is
what's
called
a
bottom
fermentation
process,
and
ale
is
a
top
fermentation
process.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
i
guess
it's
something...
i
guess...
i'm
not
sure,
but
i
think
it's
something
like
milk
in
the
old
days
before
it
was
homogenized.
the
cream
on
the
top
of
the
milk
would
be
the
equivalent
of
the
ale,
and
the
rest
of
the
milk
would
be
the
equivalent
of
the
beer.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
malt
liquor
is
the
highest
strength--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--malt
beverage.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
there
is
another
difference,
your
honor,
which
is
the
reason
why
most
consumers
don't...
only
3
percent,
historically,
of
consumers
choose
malt
liquor.
the
other
difference
is,
as
you
increase
the
alcohol
strength,
you
necessarily
increase
the
bitterness,
the
harshness,
the
roughness
of
the
taste,
and
therefore
malt
liquor
has
a
much
rougher,
harsher
taste
than
lower
alcohol
products,
which
is
precisely
why
most
producers
are
targeting
the
mid-market
and
lower.
coors,
for
example,
two-thirds
of
coors'
sales
are
of
its
light
beer
product,
which
is
4.1
percent
alcohol.
that's
what
they
asked
permission
to
do,
to
say
that
our
light
beer
is
4.1
percent
alcohol.
clearly,
coors
was
not
trying
to
attract
the
high
strength
market
there,
because
4.1
percent
is
at
the
low
end,
the
bottom
end
of
the
mainstream
range
of
beers
in
this
country,
and
why
would
coors,
which
gets
two-thirds
of
its
revenue
from
selling
a
light
beer,
want
to
abandon
that
market,
increase
the
beer
strength,
lose
those
customers,
and
compete
for
3
percent
of
the
market?
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
does
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
alcohol
content,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
it's
not
one-to-one,
but
there
is
a
one-to-one
correlation
between
calories
and
alcohol,
and
light
beer
is
supposed
to
be
lower
in
calories,
as
it
is,
and
in
order
to
do
that,
it's
necessary
to
make
it
lower
in
alcohol
content
as
well.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
typical
light
beer
will
have
less
alcohol
content.
there
is
a
range
of
alcohol
contents
in
light
beers,
however,
and
that's
what
coors
wanted
consumers
to
know.
they
wanted--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
was
not
there,
but
that's
apparently
what
the
transcript
reflects,
your
honor.
coors
did
want
to
dispel
misleading
impressions
about
the
strength
of
its
products,
but
what
it
wanted
to
disclose
was
the
accurate,
honest
information
about
the
strength
of
its
products,
and
that
information
would
have
shown
that
its
products
were
not
the
high
strength
products.
the
coors
light
beer
is
4.1
percent...
that's
what
it
wanted
to
say...
which
is
at
the
low
end.
the
other
product
it
wanted
permission
to
label
was
its
regular
beer,
which
is
4.6
percent,
which
is
the
very
mid-point
of
the
range
in
this
country.
it's
not
a
high
strength
product
at
all.
coors
was
obviously
not
trying
to
market
its
product
to
attract
the
high
strength--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
it's
probably
about
in
the
middle
of
lights,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
you
can't.
you
cannot.
if
you
happen
to
be
in
one
of
the
two-thirds
of
the
states
of
this
country
that
permit
advertising,
you
can
learn
that
from
the
advertising,
including
advertising
right
in
the
beer
store
next
to
the
label,
but
this
federal
law
bans
that
information
from
the
label
itself.
it
obviously
cannot
directly
and
materially
advance
the
federal
government's
interests
because
of
that
fact,
and
even
if
it
did,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
there
is
a
simple,
more
effective
way
to
control
the
strength
war
problem
the
government
currently
asserts
simply
by
limiting
the
alcohol
content
except
in
states
that
permit
a
higher
limit.
the
government
has
conceded
that
that
would
achieve...
fully
achieve
its
strength
wars
interest.
there's
no
reason
to
ban
truthful,
accurate,
and
important
information
in
these
circumstances.
thank
you
very
much.
