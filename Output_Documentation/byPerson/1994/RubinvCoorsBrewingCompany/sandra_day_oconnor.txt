mr.
kneedler--
justice
sandra

--there
is
both
an
advertising
ban
and
a
labeling
ban--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
malt
beverages?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
advertising
ban
applies
only
in
states
that
have
imposed
similar
restrictions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
labeling
ban
applies
unless
states
affirmatively
require
disclosure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
leads
to
a
very
curious
result,
because
in
a
majority
of
states,
then,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
would
leave
the
brewers
free
to
advertise
alcohol
content
on
malt
beverages
but
not
to
place
that
information
on
the
labels,
and
that
just
seems
a
very
odd
scheme
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
am
i
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
defense
was
something
about
encouraging
price
wars,
or
something,
and
i
would
have
thought
that
advertising
it
would
be
much
more
likely
to
result
in
the
problem--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
the
government
is
concerned
about
than
would
putting
a
truthful
piece
of
information
on
a
label.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
certainly
weakens
the
government's
position
with
regard
to
the
justification
for
the
labeling
ban.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
kneedler,
what
test
or
standard
do
you
suggest
that
we
apply
in
testing
this
ban
on
commercial
speech?
ordinarily,
we
would
apply
the
central
hudson
test,
but
it
seems
you
are
urging
us
not
even
to
employ
that
standard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
is
it
a
fact
that
in
the
tenth
circuit
argument
coors
disclosed
that
its
reason
for
this
litigation
was
to
dispel
the
notion
that
coors
is
a
weak
beer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
part
of
the
argument?
