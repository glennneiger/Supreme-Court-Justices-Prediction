mr.
kneedler,
are
we
to
look
at
the
purpose?
this
is
a
flat
ban.
it
says,
thou
shall
not
put
the
content
of
alcohol
on
the
label.
is
the
constitutionality
dependent
on
the
motive
of
the
particular
challenger,
when
all
that's
at
issue
is
whether
there
can
be
a
flat
ban?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
true
that
atf
itself
is
giving
out
the
alcohol
content?
if
someone
calls
and
says,
i'd
like
to
know
the
alcohol
content
of
coors
beer,
or
some
other
beer,
the
atf--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
the
government
is
giving
out
the
information
for
the
asking,
what
sense
does
it
make
to
prohibit
that
information
on
the
label
so
that
the
consumer
will
be
saved
a
telephone
call?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
kneedler,
one
thing
we
know
about
posadas
is
fairly
recent,
so
the
legislature
could
have
taken
into
account
that
commercial
advertising
is
subject
to
a
first
amendment
check.
isn't
it
true
that
back
in
1935
there
was
no
notion
that
commercial
advertising
was
within
the
first
amendment--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
that
wasn't
the
attitude
to
this
kind
of
legislation
more
or
less
anything
goes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
once
a
case
in
this
court
of
a
statute
that
regulated
the
sale
of,
in
fact,
a
malt
beverage,
and
the
law
was
defended...
this
was
the
law
that
said
boys
couldn't
buy
3.2
beer
until
they
are
21,
girls
could
at
18.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
defense
was,
boys
drive
more,
drink
more,
commit
more
alcohol-related
offenses.
all
of
that
was
true.
that
was
shown
to
be
true,
and
yet
this
court
held
the
law
unconstitutional
despite
the
twenty-first
amendment,
so
i
don't
buy
your
argument
that
because
we're
in
twenty-first
amendment
territory,
therefore
the
constitutional
checks
on
government
action
are
so
diluted
that
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
you
don't
have
a
nude
dancer.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
other
example
in
all
of
food
and
drug
labeling
law
where
knowledge
is
prohibited,
knowledge
of
the
content
of
what
one
is
ingesting
is
prohibited
on
the
label?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
law?
here
we're
dealing
with
a
statute
passed
by
congress.
has
congress
said
in
any...
for
any
other
food
or
drug,
there
shalt
not
tell
the
public
what's
in
this
commodity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
mr.
ennis,
you
are
conceding
that
in
1934,
'35,
there
was
a
legitimate
documented
purpose
for
this
statute.
that
is,
one
could
not
accurately
gauge
the
percentage
of
alcohol
in
malt
beverages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
a
state
wanted
to
encourage
drinking
wine
instead
of,
say,
distilled
spirits,
could
it
say,
we
have
a
flat
advertising
ban
on
distilled
spirits,
but
we'll
allow
you,
indeed
encourage
you,
to
advertise
wine
so
as
to
get
the
consumers
to
shift
their
preferences?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
evidence
of
wars,
was
there
anything
about
substitution
of
consumers
who
are
looking
for
higher
alcohol
content
to
wine,
to
something
with...
or
to
the
bitterer
beverage,
the
malt
liquor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
couldn't
this
regulation
make
it
worse?
i
mean,
if
you
go
to
new
orleans
at
mardi
gras
time
you
see
a
lot
of
cheap
wine
around,
perhaps
as
many
as
those
bottles
of
beer.
