of
course,
labeling
isn't
always
for
promotive
purposes.
sometimes
you
have
warning
labels.
what
if
they
said,
warning,
you
have
4
percent
alcohol
in
this
stuff,
that's
dangerous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
say
it
is.
they
say
they
want
to
inform
the
consumer
about
how
much
alcohol
is
in
the
beer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
probably
was
unanimous
agreement
that
all
competition
was
undesirable,
too,
in
that
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
a
pretty
rigid
industry
in
1933.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
classic
examples,
the
antitrust
enforcement
throughout
this
industry,
at
that
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
basis
of
alcohol
content
for
this
rather
limited
product,
but
what
about
everything
else,
like
wine,
and
whiskey,
and
other
alcoholic
beverages?
why
doesn't
the
same
interest
work
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
the
industry
presented
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
supposing
that
the
market
is
consumed
of
a
variety
of
consumers,
some
of
whom
want
to
get
drunk
as
fast
as
they
can,
and
they're
the
people
you're
concerned
about,
and
others
of
whom
would
like
to
be
careful
and
moderate
in
their
drinking
and
be
able
to
drive
without
violating
the
statutes
and
so
forth.
they
have
an
interest
in
knowing
how
much
alcohol
is
in
the
beer,
not
for
that
purpose
but
for
a
good,
legitimate
purpose
of
safety,
and
health,
and
all
the
rest.
do
we
weigh
their
interest
in
the
balance,
or
is
it
sufficient
to
sustain
the
statute
to
say,
well,
maybe
the
15,
20
percent
of
the
people
are
hard
drinkers
and
want
to
get
drunk,
and
we're
going
to
focus
on
them
and
ignore
the
others?
is
that
a
sufficient
justification
for
sustaining
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
the
market
is
equally
divided
between
the
two
kinds
of
people
i
described,
does
the
first
amendment
require
us
to
give
preference
to
one
interest
rather
than
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
first
amendment
is
neutral
on
whether
there
should
be
disclosure
and
public
knowledge
of
important
information.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
half
the
people
would
benefit
from
a
paternalistic
denial
of
information--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
in
posadas,
with
gambling,
that
was
advertising
that
was
justified,
not
refusal
of
labeling.
that
wouldn't
justify
a
statute
that
said
that
the
black
jack
table
can't
post
the
actual
odds
of
winning
or
losing,
or
something
like
that,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
anything
that
you
can
prohibit
in
terms
of
advertising
you
can
also
prohibit
in
labeling.
that's
your
solution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
malt
liquor,
top
or
bottom?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
malt
liquor
top
or
bottom?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
it's
the
highest
strength,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
that
the
only
difference
between
it
and...
ale
and
beer,
that
it's
got
more
alcohol
in
it?
