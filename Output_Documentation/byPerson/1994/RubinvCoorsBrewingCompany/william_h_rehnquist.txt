chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-1631,
lloyd
bentsen
v.
the
coors
brewing
company.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
kneedler,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
advertising
ban
is
not
being
challenged
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
twenty-first
amendment,
mr.
kneedler,
conferred
authority
on
the
states,
not
on
the
federal
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
ennis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
ennis,
how
do
we
treat
that
here?
is
it
an
appropriate
function
for,
say,
a
district
court
to
say
that,
well,
we
know
that
congress
thought
there
were
going
to
be
strength
wars
but
we
don't
think
there
will
be,
therefore
the
statute
that
congress
passed
is
invalid?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
no
deference
is
given
to
the
congressional
determination
that
it
was?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
the
sort
of
finding
just
as
if
two
lower
courts
had
made
a
finding
in
a
diversity
accident
case
that
the
stop
light
was
green
rather
than
red?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
truly
a
finding
of
fact
when
you're
challenging
what
is
thought
to
be
a
legislative
premise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
of
1934?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
could
that
contradict
a
congressional
determination
as
of
1934?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
could
it
contradict
a
congressional
presumption?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if...
just
to
isolate
this
particular
issue,
what
if
there
had
been?
what
if...
let's
say,
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
it
was
clear
that
congress
thought
there
would
be
strength
wars
in
1934,
could
a
finding
by
a
district
court
in
1992
that
in
1992
there
was
no
danger
of
a
strength
war,
could
that
upset
a
congressional
determination
in
1934?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
reading
from
somewhere
that
we
can
look
at?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
somewhere
in
the
briefs,
or--
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
it
is
not,
except
that
isolated
passage.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when,
between
1934
and
the
present,
did
it
become
possible
to
measure
the
alcoholic
content
of
beer,
because
i
remember
in
the
service,
all
you
could
buy
in
px's
was
something
called
3.2
beer,
so
apparently
by
1943
they
at
least
thought
they
had
learned
to
measure
the
content
of
beer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
mr.
ennis,
perhaps
conceding
that,
could
a
state
simply
ban
liquor
advertising?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
you
should
respond
to
hypothetical
questions,
even
though
they're
not
necessarily
involved
in
your
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
my
question
was
not
what
you're
answering.
maybe
i
should
repeat
my
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
was,
could
a
state
ban
liquor
advertising,
ban
all
advertising
for
alcoholic
beverages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
light
beer
doesn't
mean...
has
nothing
to
do
with
alcoholic
content.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
typical
light
beer
will
have
less
alcohol
content?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ennis.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
93-1631,
rubin
v.
coors
brewing
co.
would
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
