justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
concede
that
at
least
as
an
interest
on
the
first
prong,
or,
i
guess,
the
second
prong,
central
hudson,
that's
a
perfectly
legitimate
interest
for
the
government
to
have,
so
your
attack
here
goes
simply
to
whether
it
furthers,
and
whether
it
fits?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
way
you
pose
your...
put
your
answer,
i
assume
you
are
implicitly
claiming
that
the
government
doesn't
really
entertain
that
interest.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
don't
we
take
the
government's
statement,
the
statement
of
the
government's
lawyer,
as
representing
the
government's
position
on
its
interest
and
then
see
whether
in
fact
there
is
a
furtherance
and
there
is
a
fit?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
the
government
doesn't
have
a
good
argument
in
support
of
its
interest
in
the
sense
that
it
should
have
had
an
interest
in
doing
more
than
it
did.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
agreed,
but
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy,
i
thought,
was
that
in
fact
the
government
interest
could
change
over
time,
and
i
thought
it
was
implicit
in
what
you
said
that
the
government
doesn't
have
to
reenact
the
statute
for
the
purpose
of
manifesting
a
new
interest
that
could
legitimately
be
considered
under
central
hudson.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
