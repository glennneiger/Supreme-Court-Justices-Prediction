it
seems
to
me,
mr.
kneedler,
that
if
you
were
to
prevail
in
this
case
and
one
of
us
was
assigned
the
majority
opinion,
we'd
begin
by
saying,
the
government
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
ensuring
that
consumers
are
not
fully
informed,
and
then
after
that
the
opinion
would
get
rather
difficult,
it
seems
to
me.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
kneedler,
what
do
we
do
if
we
have
a
case
in
which
congress
has
a
legitimate
and
sustainable
interest
in
restricting
commercial
speech
when
it
passes
a
statute,
but
then
because
of
the
passage
of
time
and
changes
in
marketing
and
changes
in
consumer
habits,
that
interest
is
quite
evidently,
let's
assume,
no
longer
legitimate,
no
longer
compelling?
is
the
statute
then
subject
to
attack,
do
you
think,
or
can
you
defend
it
on
the
grounds
that
at
the
time
it
was
enacted
there
was
a
legitimate
interest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
cast
it
something
in
terms
of
a
presumption
and
indicate
that
perhaps
consumer
tastes
being
fickle
would
change
in
the
near
future
and
this
statute
would
again--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
that
if
we
rule
in
favor
of
coors
that
the
state
statutes
would
necessarily
be
invalid
too,
state
antilabeling?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
to
follow
from
that
that
the
state
statutes
would
be
invalid
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
interests
would
the
states
have
that
you
have
not
been
able
to
identify
and
adduce
in
your
brief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
the
government
could
defend
its
statute
on
the
grounds
that
even
though
there
was
no
legitimate
purpose
at
the
time
of
its
enactment,
a
legitimate
purpose
has
arisen
since.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
can't
know
any
of
this
by
looking
at
the
label.
[laughter]
