justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
and
it
is
an
interesting
case
that
involves
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
beer
labels
and
the
first
amendment
an
unlikely
combination.
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act
prohibits
beer
labels
from
displaying
alcohol
content.
respondents
sought
approval
from
the
batf
for
proposed
labels
that
disclosed
alcohol
content,
but
this
application
was
rejected.
respondent
filed
a
suit
on
the
ground
that
the
ban
on
disclosure
had
violated
the
first
amendment
protection
of
commercial
speech.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
respondent
and
invalidated
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
act.
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
and
held
that
the
ban
violates
the
first
amendment
because
it
fails
to
advance
the
government
interest
in
a
direct
and
material
way.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
we
agree
with
the
government
that
it
does
have
a
substantial
interest
in
suppressing
competition
by
brews
on
the
basis
of
alcohol
content.
we
do
not
agree
however
that
the
government
asserted
interest
in
facilitating
the
state’s
exercise
of
their
powers
over
alcohol
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
a
sufficiently
substantial
interest.
the
government
has
offered
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
states
are
in
need
of
federal
assistance
in
this
area.also,
the
ban
fails
because
it
does
not
directly
advance
the
government
state
of
interest
in
suppressing
“strength
wars”.other
parts
of
the
act
that
mere
implementing
regulations
such
as
provision
allowing
the
disclosure
of
alcohol
content
in
advertisements
and
the
identification
of
certain
high
alcohol
beers
as
malt
liquor,
undermine
and
counteract
the
effects
of
the
labeling
ban.
further,
the
ban
is
more
expensive
than
necessary,
since
available
alternatives
to
the
labeling
ban,
such
as
directly
limiting
alcohol
content
of
beers
were
prohibiting
marketing
efforts
that
promote
the
high
alcohol
strength
would
be
less
intrusive
to
the
first
amendment’s
protection
for
commercial
speech.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
