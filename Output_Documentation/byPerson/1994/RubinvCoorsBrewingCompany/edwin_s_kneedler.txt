mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
unconstitutional
a
provision
in
section
5(e)
of
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act
that
has
regulated
the
interstate
sale
of
malt
beverages
for
almost
60
years.
specifically,
paragraph
(2)
of
section
5(e)
prohibits
statements
of
alcohol
content
on
the
labels
of
malt
beverages
unless
such
statements
are
required
by
state
law.
that
provision
was
enacted
soon
after
adoption
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
and
was
designed
to
implement
it,
and
it
reflected
a
considered
judgment
by
congress,
as
stated
in
the
house
committee
report,
that
malt
beverages
should
not
be
sold
on
the
basis
of
alcohol
content.
this
restriction
serves
the
substantial
governmental
interest
of
not
facilitating
or
encouraging
the
purchase
or
consumption
of
malt
beverages
for
the
purpose
of
getting
intoxicated.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
by
virtue
of
the
way
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
has
construed
it,
the
parenthetical
clause
in
section
5(e)(2)
specifically
addresses
the
interaction
of
state
and
federal
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
can
be
that
difference
in
those
states,
but
first
of
all,
i...
congress
could
reasonably
conclude
that
having
the
alcohol
content
on
the
bottle,
on
the
very
product
that
is
the
subject
of
the
commercial
transaction,
would
enable...
facilitate
impulse
buying
at
the
point
of
sale,
so
at
the
very
time
the
consumer
is
going
to
buy--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
thus
far,
although
i
think
the
materials
suggest
that
we're
beginning
to
see
some
movement
into
traditional
advertising,
that
has
not
been
a
problem,
and
perhaps
because
advertising
is
often
at
a
national
level,
particularly
media
advertising,
so
that
advertising,
if
it's
not
lawful
everywhere,
for
instance,
in
network
tv,
that
it
wouldn't
be
placed
because
it
wouldn't
be
lawful
in
a
number
of
states
into
which
it
would
go.
and
of
course,
if
the
states
perceive
a
problem
in
this
area,
they
may
enact
laws
addressing
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
think
it...
first
of
all,
the
point
you're
raising
i
think
would
only
go
to
the
application,
in
any
event,
to
the
labeling
ban
in
those
states
that
allow
advertising
but
don't
require
the
labeling,
and
thus
far
in
this
case
respondent
has
not
challenged
the
application
of
the
labeling
requirement
on
a
state-by-state
basis
in
that
manner,
and
again,
the
substantial
governmental
interest
here
includes
the
interest
in
accommodating
state
regulations,
so
the
labeling
restriction
applies
unless
a
state
strikes
a
different
balance.
now,
if
in
those
states
that
have
not
prohibited
advertising
the
federal
regulation
on
labeling
were
thought
to
be
somewhat
undermined,
that
would
be
a
problem
only
in
those
states.
but
again,
that
has
not
been
the
burden
of
respondent's
argument
in
this
case.
respondent's
submission
of
its
labels
to
atf
was
across
the
board
and,
in
fact,
at
page
61
of
the
joint
appendix
respondent
asks,
specifically
asks
atf
to
consider
its
submission
as
a
package,
as
a
program,
including,
in
fact,
both
advertising
and
labeling
restrictions.
atf
denied
it
except
in
those
states
that
allowed
it
in
the
manner
that
you've
described,
and
then
respondent
brought
this
suit
under
the
apa
to
challenge
atf's
restriction
across
the
board.
if
it...
if...
an
as-applied,
or
a
state-by-state
challenge
of
the
sort
you're
describing,
would
be
a
different
lawsuit.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
correct.
the
advertising
ban
was
sustained
by
the
district
court,
and
respondent
has
not
challenged
that.
in
fact,
it's
interesting,
at
page
35
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
where
the
district
court's
decision
on
remand
is
set
forth,
the
district
court
specifically
acknowledges
in
the
first
paragraph
on
page
35a,
i
agree
after
hearing
the
evidence
that
attempts
to
market
alcohol
content
as
a
product
attribute
are
not
legitimate
attempts.
they
are
contrary
to
substantial
governmental
policy.
that
is
precisely
the
judgment
that
was
set
forth
in
the
house
report
in
1935.
the
district
court
accepted
that
very
judgment
with
respect
to
advertising,
but
then
inconsistently,
in
our
view,
declined
to
accept
and
recognize
the
very
same
purpose
as
it
applies
in
labeling.
as
this
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
one
type
of
labeling,
but
that
is
not
the
sort
of
labeling
that
respondent
is
promoting
here.
it's
signif--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
with
all
respect,
it
seems
quite
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
respondent's
very
purpose
in
challenging
the
labeling
restriction
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
it's
relevant
in
this
precise...
in
this
particular
sense,
and
it's
a
sense
that
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
both
posadas
and
in
central
hudson,
and
that
is
that
a
restriction
such
as
this
rests
on
the
common
sense
judgment
that
a
dampening
of
advertising
or
promotion
will
dampen
the
demand
for
the
product,
and
in
this
case
the
restriction
of
the
demand
on
the
basis
of
this
particular
attribute,
alcohol
content,
would
dampen
the
demand
to
buy
the
product
for
the
purpose
of
getting
intoxicated
on
the
basis
of
that
attribute.
in
posadas
and
central
hudson--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--with
respect
to
malt
liquor,
in
particular,
last...
in
the
spring
of
1993,
atf
solicited
public
comments
on
precisely
the
use
of
malt
liquor.
historically
malt
liquor...
now,
malt
liquor
is
understood
as
a
category
of
malt
beverage
that
has
a
higher
alcohol
content,
but
historically
malt
liquor
was
a
term
that
encompassed
the
entire
category
of
malt
beverages,
and
this
is
an
understanding
that
goes
way
back,
so
when
those
labels
were
first
approved
in
the
early
sixties,
atf
presumably
concluded
that
malt
liquor
did
not
have
a
particular--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--apparently...
apparently
atf
does
not
have
an
explanation
in
its
records
for
why
they
were
approved,
but
this
is
now
being
considered.
but
again,
if
malt
liquor
is
thought
to
be
a
particular
problem,
then
that's
something
that
atf
can
address
under
what
respondent
concedes
to
be
its
powers
under
the
other
labeling
provisions,
and
atf
is
considering
precisely
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
to
reiterate,
justice
scalia,
that
rationale
would
apply
only
in
those
particular
states
where
advertising
was
permitted
and
the
labeling
restriction
applied.
much
like
edge
broadcasting,
this
statute
furthers
the
additional
interest
of
accommodating--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--oh,
i'm
sorry,
but
with
respect
to
malt
liquor,
well,
that...
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
district
court,
or
court
of
appeals
judgment
in
this
case,
and
i
think
there
is
a
question
whether,
i
suppose
a
legislative
judgment
for
atf
to
make
in
the
first
instance
whether
malt
liquor
in
fact
conveys
that
sense.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
one
of
the
atf
witnesses
at
trial
said
that,
but
again,
that
i
think
furthers...
highlights
that
this
is
not
a
blanket
prohibition
on
any
public
utterance
or
information
about
alcohol
content.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
what
it
is,
justice
ginsburg,
is
the
difference
between
making
information
available
for
consumers
who
want
to
look
to
that
information
if
they
should
want
to
compare
on
the
basis
of
selecting
on
the
basis
of
low
alcohol
content,
for
example,
on
the
one
hand,
and
on
the
other
hand
making,
not
allowing
brewers
and
others
to
use
precisely
the
alcohol
content
of
the
beverage
for
purposes
of
promoting
it,
and
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
with
all
respect,
justice
kennedy,
in
1935,
when
congress
looked
at
this
precise
question,
and
in
fact
before
that
in
1934,
when
the
federal
alcohol
control
administration
looked
at
this
question,
there
was
virtually
unanimous
agreement
among
the
brewing
industry
itself
that
competition
on
the
basis
of
alcohol
content
specifically
including
the
labeling
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but...
but--
[laughter]
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
first
of
all
in
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but
the
twenty-first
amendment,
which
had
just
been
adopted,
recognizes
that
there
can
often
be
a
very
substantial
governmental
interest
in
not
promoting
competition
on
the
basis
of,
in
particular,
alcohol--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
problem
that
congress
had
before
it
in
1934--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--was
one
specifically
related
to
malt
beverage
and
the
behavior
of
brewers
in
the
malt
beverage
industry
that
in
fact
had
promoted
beer
as
an
intoxicant
rather
than
as
a
beverage
or
as
a
food
type
beverage.
in
posadas,
for
example,
the
court
recognized
that
puerto
rico
had
not
prohibited
advertising
concerning
all
forms
of
gambling,
but
had
focused
on
the
particular
form
of
gambling
that
had
led
to
the
particular
social
ill
that
was
being
addressed,
in
that
case
casino
gambling,
and
this
case,
in
our
view,
is
exactly
like
posadas
and
in
fact--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
the
point
you're
making
in
fact
cuts
the
other
way.
this
statute
was
passed
in
the
immediate
wake
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
which
conferred
on
the
states
what
this
court
has
recognized
as
an
extra
measure
of
power
to
regulate
in
the
area
of
alcohol
production
and
sale
and,
in
fact,
traditionally
the
alcohol
industry
has
been
subject
to
perhaps
the
most
stringent
regulations
of
any
area
for...
and
principally
to
regulate
access
to
the
product.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i...
our
submission
is
not
that
the
first
amendment
is
inapplicable
in
this
context,
and
in
the
case
you're
speaking
of,
that
was
a
situation
where
the
state
was
operating
in
an
area
where
class-based
stereotypes
were
simply
not...
were
not
permissible.
in
this
case,
first
of
all
in
the
first
amendment
speech
case,
both
before
and
after
craig
v.
boren,
this
court
has
recognized
in
california
v.
larue
and
subsequent
cases
that
the
first
amendment
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
alcohol
has
to
be
accommodated
or
the
state
government
may
properly
accommodate
the
first
amendment
to
the
compelling
governmental
interest
in
regulating
alcohol.
and
in
larue,
in
fact,
the
court
deferred
to
what
it
termed
the
reasonable
judgment
by
the
california
legislature
that
nude
dancing
should
not
take
place
where
alcohol
is
sold
even
though
it
was
alleged
that
the
conduct
there
should
have
been
examined
under
the
o'brien
test,
and
the
court
said
that
the
o'brien
test
was
unnecessary
precisely
because
the
state
was
operating
in
an
area
governed
by
the
twenty-first
amendment.
and
we
think
that
if
that
rationale
applied
in
larue,
it
applies
a
fortiori
here
because
what
we
were
talking--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
what
we
do
have
is,
we
think,
something
even
more
compelling,
and
that
is
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
commercial
speech
is
subject
to
regulation
precisely
because
it
is
closely
related
to
commercial
transactions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
oh,
i
think
the
statute
carries
with
it
a
strong
presumption
that
the
circumstances
that
gave
rise
to
it
continue
to
obtain,
and
i
do...
and
i
think
it's
important
that
what
is
being
alleged
here
are
changes
in
the
market,
or
changes
in
consumer
preferences,
which
are
themselves
subject
to
change
and,
in
fact,
one
thing
that
respondent
doesn't
acknowledge
is
that
the
very
consumer
preferences
that
respondent
is
suggesting
are
happening...
a
push
toward
low
alcohol
beer...
are
undoubtedly
influenced
in
large
part
by
the
very
restrictions
that
respondent
is
challenging
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
but
i
also
think
that
what...
where
the
governmental
regulation
is
directed
to
market
influences,
that
the
fact
that
the
market
might
change
doesn't
alter
the
fact
that
there
is
an
inherent
possibility
that
a
certain
type
of
advertising
will
promote
the
conduct,
and
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
first
of
all,
even
if
some
segments
of
the
market,
on
average,
the
alcohol
content
is
going
down,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
governmental
purpose
here
is
not
directly
advanced
as
to
those
portions
of
the
market
where
there
would
be
promotion
on
the
basis
of
high
content.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there
is...
there
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--several
things
i
would
point
to.
first
of
all
was
the
very
substantial
evidence
in
1934
and
1935
when
this
was
first
adopted
by
the
federal
alcohol
control
administration
and
by
congress,
and
then
today,
with
respect
to
the
malt
beverage...
excuse
me,
the
malt
liquor
segment
of
the
market,
which
is
a
market
that
i
think
there's
general
acknowledgement
it's
a
higher
alcohol
content
beer,
or
malt
beverage,
and
it
is
promoted
on
the
basis
of
its
alcoholic
content.
and
also,
again,
with
respect
to
coors,
the
record
contains
cards
that
were
handed
out
by
coors,
and
in
fact
coors
entered
into
a
settlement
with
atf,
or
at
least
handed
out
by
a
distributor,
identifying
the
alcohol
content
of
coors
beverages
as
compared
to
other
beers
within
various
price
ranges.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
for
the
most
part,
yes.
i
mean,
the
court
made
this
point
in
central
hudson,
for
example,
in...
where
the
court
said
it
was
up
to
the
agency
to
balance
the
judgment
as
to
whether
the
off-peak
and
on-peak
electric
demand
would
go
up
or
down
depending
on
what
sort
of
advertising
would
take
place,
and
we
think
a
similar
point
is
true
here.
what
there
is,
there
may
be
competing
interest
with
respect
to
whether
disclosure
of
the
content
would
actually
further...
would,
on
balance,
be
preferable,
or
whether
not
allowing
promotion
of
the
product
on
the
basis
of
the
precise
attribute
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
addresses,
whether
prohibiting
that
is,
on
balance,
the
preferable
approach.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
suppose
in
this
sense,
that
if
the
food
&
drug
administration
prescribes
a
certain
list
of
ingredients
that
shall
be
on
there
and
nothing
else--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
that
i'm
aware
of,
but
again,
going
back
to
justice
stevens'
point,
it
really
is
a
question
of
striking
a
balance,
and
what
this
statute
does,
for
example,
is
to
allow
the
states
in
the
exercise
of
their
twenty-first
amendment
power
to
strike
a
different
balance
and
perhaps
conclude
that
the
interest
in
disclosure
outweighs
the
concerns
about
promoting
the
product
for
the
purposes
of
getting
intoxicated,
and
in...
on
page
16a
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
as
long
as--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
as
long
as
the
legislature
could
reasonably
conclude--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
half
the
people
might
benefit,
but
the
risks
associated
with
the
other
half
getting
the
information
might
be
far
worse.
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
past
the
dangers
associated
with
alcohol
consumption,
and
it's
precisely
the
people
most
prone
to
use
alcohol...
young
people,
for
example,
unsafe
driving
on
the
highway,
who
would
be
attracted
to
the
alcohol
because
of
its
higher
content.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
think
the
statute
satisfies
the
central
hudson
test
for
the
reasons
i've
explained.
it
directly
advances
the
goal
of
not
promoting
alcohol
consumption
for
the
purpose
of
getting
intoxicated,
and
it's
tailored
to
that
end
by
focusing
on
that
attribute,
but
we
do
think
it's
significant
that
this
regulation
takes
place
in
the
context
of
what
this
court
recognized
in
posadas
as
socially
harmful
activities.
although
posadas
involved
gambling,
it
also
specifically
identified
alcohol
consumption
as
another
socially
harmful
activity,
and
like
gambling,
it
can
have
adverse
consequences
on
third
parties.
it's
not
simply
the
individual
himself
or
herself
who
might
want
the
information,
but
it
may
have--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
we
think
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
think
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
think
the
activities
identified
in
posadas
are
ones
in
which
there
is
a
tradition
in
history
of...
of
considerable
social
ill,
of
governmental
concern,
and
a
history
of
stringent
regulation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
may--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the...
i
suppose
one
could
identify
the
categories
associated
with
morality
or
vice,
but
in
this
case
it's
not
even
necessary
to
identify
what
the
category
might
be
in
the
abstract
on
the
basis
of
posadas.
here,
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
in
this
court's
decision
in
kordel
it
recognized
that
labeling
is
a
form
of
advertising,
but
what
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--at
least
with
respect
to
alcohol,
and
we
think
in
this
case
there's
no
need
to
consider
what
the
parameters
of
the
posadas
category
might
be,
because
the
twenty-first
amendment
embodies
in
the
constitution
itself
the
compelling
governmental
interest
in
regulating
that
category
of
commercial
activity.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
but
this
statute
among
other
things
advances
the
state
interest
because
states...
a
number
of
states,
in
fact
almost
every
state,
either
by
operation
of
this
statute
or
their
own
statutes,
have
a
restriction
on
labeling.
but
my
point
is
that
the
twenty-first
amendment,
while
conferring
authority
directly
on
the
states,
does
recognize
in
the
constitution
itself
the
important
governmental
interest
in
regulating
alcohol.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
would
at
least
call
them
into
question,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
the
governmental
interest
in
this
should
necessarily
depend
upon
a
state-by-state
examination
of
the
interest.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
the
states
should
not
be
precluded
from
demonstrating
what
their
interests
are
and
what
information
has
been...
has
been
gathered,
and
on
what
basis
they
acted.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
the
court
were
to
conclude,
contrary
to
our
submission,
that
there
had
to
be
broader
factual
findings,
we
wouldn't
think
that
the
states
should
be
foreclosed
from
doing
that.
but
again,
the
twenty-first
amendment
we
think
empowers
the
states
to
nip
in
the
bud
the
potential
for
promotion
of
alcohol
on
the
basis
of
alcohol
content.
they
should
not
have
to
wait
for
the
damaging
effects.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
in
response
to
questions
by
justice
o'connor
and
justice
scalia,
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
pages
65
and
336
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
include
the
wallet
cards
that
coors
distributed
listing...
comparing
its
alcohol
content
to
those
of
others,
in
which
it
was
listing
itself
as
highest,
or
close
to
the
highest,
and
also
the
advertisement
that
it
asked
atf--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
advertisement
it
asked
atf
to
include
lists
both
lights,
on
page
65
lists
both
light
beers
and
full-bodied
beers,
and
it
lists
itself
as
one
of
the
highest
content
light
beers,
and
also
within
the
mid-to-high
range
of
the
regular
beer.
so
the
point
is,
coors
was
holding
itself
out
as
having
at
least
an
average,
if
not
above-average
alcohol
content
within
each
segment
of
the
market,
which
is
precisely
what
this
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
purpose
is
to
prohibit...
it's
a
balance
of
the
interest
in
labeling.
at
the
point
of
sale,
there
are
two
interests,
and
the
labeling,
to
be
able
to
compare
alcohol
content
at
the
point
of
sale
by
picking
up
two
bottles
can
lead
to
impulse
buying
in
the
same
way
that
this
court
recognized
in
the
lawyer
advertising
case
there
can
be
impulse
decisions
on
hiring
an
attorney
by
virtue
of
the
face-to-face
contact.
the
second
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
with
respect
to
the
purpose
of
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
was
a
discussion
primarily
within
the
malt
beverage
industry,
because
that's
where
the
abuse
was,
and
it
was
identified
as
an
abuse,
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
house
report
on
page
16-a.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
justice
ginsburg,
no.
the
statute
has
been
construed
by
atf
to
allow
disclosure
of
low
alcohol
content
beer,
so
it's
tailored
to
limiting
the
concern
about
marketing
on
the
basis
of
high
alcohol
content
and
intoxication.
