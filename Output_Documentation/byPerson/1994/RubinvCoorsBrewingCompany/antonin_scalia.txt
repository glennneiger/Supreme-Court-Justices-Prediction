justice

is
it
common
sense
to
allow
that
to
be
put
on
billboards
but
not
on
the
label,
and
is
it
common
sense
not
to
allow
the
percentage
to
be
shown,
but
to
allow
it
to
be
called
on
the
label
and
in
advertising
malt
liquor,
or
i
suppose
supermalt
liquor?
justice
antonin
scalia
had
it
changed
its
meaning
by
the
early
sixties?
you
don't
think
when
it
came
out
as
malt
liquor
in
the
early
sixties
that
wasn't
known
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
one
step
at
a
time
is
a
fine
thing
when
you're
not
in
the
first
amendment
area,
but
it
seems
to
me
we
demand
a
higher
level
of
rationality
when
you're
prohibiting
the
conveying
of
information,
and
i
think
it
is,
it
seems
to
me,
quite
irrational
to
allow
the
notion
that
this
beverage
contains
a
higher
than
ordinary
alcoholic
content
to
be
conveyed
in
all
other
ways
but
not
by
saying
it
has
4
percent
alcohol.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
disagree.
you
can
say
malt
liquor
on
the
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
kneedler,
what
evidence
does
the
government
have,
what
hard
evidence,
that
there
will
be
a
war
of
brewers
fighting
to
put
in
more
expensive
alcohol
into
their
beer
when
this...
what
hard
evidence
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
friends
who
consume
hard
whiskey,
and
they
tell
me
that
the
alcoholic
content
of
that
has
gone
down
over
the
years,
to
their
great
disappointment,
from
90--
[laughter]
from
90
to
86
to
80.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there's
any
evidence
that
there
would
be
a
price...
that
there
would
be
a,
you
know,
an
alcoholic
content
war.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
evidence
is
there
such
a
thing
would
happen?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
can
look
over
the
vast
range
of
activities
that
are
lawful,
that
are
not
wicked
enough
to
be
made
unlawful,
and
say,
well,
some
of
them
are
questionable
enough
that
we
don't
want
the
people
to
have
information
about
them.
i
mean,
that
has
great
possibility.
what
about
automobiles?
i
guess
car
manufacturers
can
be
prohibited
from
advertising
how
fast
a
car
can
go.
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
even
how
many
horsepower
the
engine
has.
justice
antonin
scalia
people
tend
to
drive
too
fast.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
so
with
driving
automobiles?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
hard
to
think
of
what's
more
heavily
regulated
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry,
you
think
a
statute
survives
judicial
attack
if
congress
makes
findings
which
it
would
not
survive
if
congress
didn't,
so
we're
telling
congress
to
legislate
in
a
certain
fashion?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
we
assume
that
the
necessary
findings
sustain
any
congressional
statute?
isn't
that
the
assumption?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
would
be
valid
if
there
were
findings
of
fact--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
since
congress
did
not
make
findings
of
fact
it's
invalid?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
otherwise
a
statute
could
be
valid,
could
be
invalid,
we
don't
assume
that
the
findings
were
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
my
understanding.
i
think
every
piece
of
legislation
comes
to
us
with
a
presumption
of
validity,
with
a
presumption
that
the...
it's
not
a
conclusive
presumption,
but
certainly
we
take
it
that
going
in,
congress
did
its
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ennis,
surely
there
are
different
classes
of
consumers
of
liquor,
wine,
and
beer.
i
mean,
one
doesn't
find
high
school
students
hanging
around
the
street
corner
drinking
rose
wine,
and
if
that's
the
class
of
consumer
one
is
worried
about,
it
makes
sense
to
have
a
different
rule
for
beer
than
one
might
have
for
hard
liquor
or
wine.
i
don't
know
that
that's
irrational.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
happens,
and
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
law
may
well
be
concerned
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
he
may
not
have
meant
that.
i
mean,
that
sounds
good.
that's
how
i
would
market
the
bill,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it...
do
we
know
how
many
people
were
there
when
he
said
that?
i
mean,
maybe
nobody
heard
him.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
a
strange
determination
for
judges
to
make?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
congress
and
the
other
political
branch
that
judges
what
means
are
most
appropriate
to
certain
ends.
do
you
really
think
a
federal
district
judge
can
sit
in
judgment
on
whether,
nationwide,
this
particular
interest
is
furthered
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
ale?
what's
the
difference
between
ale
and
beer?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
that
explains
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
4.1
is
the
low
end
of
beers,
but
not
the
low
end
of
lights,
i
gather.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
highest
light?
