stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
go
back
for
a
second?
i
need
some
help
on
this
point,
which
may
be
just
a
technical
point,
but
it
is
one
i
need
some
help
on.
suppose
that...
i
think,
divide
the
states
into
two
categories,
states
that
have
an
advertising
ban,
and
states
that
don't.
all
right,
as
to
the
second
group
of
states,
i
don't
know
what
interest
this
fulfills,
this
labeling
ban,
so
i
guess
i
agree
with
you
on
that
one.
but
as
to
the
first,
what
about
their
argument
that
this
helps...
this
helps
the
states
enforce
their
twenty-first
amendment
right
to
get
rid
of
all
these
trade
wars
and
so
forth,
and
suppose
i
thought
that.
then
what
should
we
do?
and
suppose
i'd
also
thought
that
they've
got
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
wrong,
that
that
word
require
doesn't
mean
that
you
distinguish
between
(e)
and
(f),
but
rather
the
second
part
of
(f)
sweeps
both,
and
it
was
just
a
little
overkill,
that
word
require.
suppose
i
thought
all
those
things.
i'm
not
saying
i
do,
but
suppose
i
did,
then
what
would
you
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
probably
about
four.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
that
i'm
thinking
of
those
11.
now,
suppose
you
interpreted
the
statute
to
mean
that
what
they
had
in
mind
was
the
advertising
and
labeling
bans
are
supposed
to
exist
only
where
there
are
state
advertising
and
labeling
bans.
why
wouldn't
i
interpret
the
statute
that
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
there
certainly
is
strong
language
supporting
that.
and
then
if
you
do
interpret
the
statute
that
way,
then
why
wouldn't
it
be
constitutional
as
an
effort
to
simply
prevent
what
at
that
time
they
thought
would
have
been
shipping
from
out-of-state
a
label
that
would
have
violated
the
state
law?
that's
what
i
think
of
that
argument
as
being.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
no
one
has.
that's
why...
we're
supposed
to
uphold
statutes
as
constitutional
if
they
can
be
so
upheld,
reasonably--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
that's
why
i'm
uncertain,
as
a
technical
matter,
what
one
is
supposed
to
do
in
this
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if...
with
that
kind
of
an
argument.
that's
why
i'm
asking
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
they
have
much
more
power,
i
take
it,
a
state,
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
or
some
more
power
than
if
that
twenty-first
amendment
weren't
there,
and
suppose
that
we
thought,
or
i
thought,
suppose
i
thought
that
it
just
squeaks
within
that,
therefore
a
state
can
ban
this,
then
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
does
it
not
give
power?
that's
my
question,
really.
might
it
not,
or
does
it
or
does
it
not
give
power
to
the
federal
government
to
reinforce
the
state
ban
by
passing
a
law
federally
necessary--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
make
that
state
ban
effective?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
purpose
served...
the
purpose
served
by
this
labeling
reg
in
those
33
states
that
allow
you
to
advertise
is?
