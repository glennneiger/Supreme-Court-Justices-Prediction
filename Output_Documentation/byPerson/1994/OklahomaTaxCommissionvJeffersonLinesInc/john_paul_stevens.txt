justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
your
tax
would
cover...
forget
interstate
commerce
and
transportation
for
a
moment.
supposing
you
bought
your
super
bowl
tickets
in
oklahoma,
would
the
tax
apply,
the
super
bowl
being
played
in
some
other
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
going
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
there
doesn't
have
to
be
any
part
of
the
service
performed
within
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
then,
a
travel
agency
doing
business
in
oklahoma
pays
the
tax
on
all
the
sales
it
makes
regardless
of
what
the
tickets
are?
in
other
words,
somebody
buys
tickets
from
an
oklahoma
travel
agent
for
use
going
from
new
york
to
london
or
some
place,
he'd
still
pay
the
tax
in
oklahoma?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
told
me
earlier
that
a
comparable
transaction
to
the
apple
transaction
would
be
subject
to
the
tax.
i
asked
you
about
a
super
bowl
ticket.
that's...
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
going
to
the
super
bowl
in
miami
and
selling
apples
in
miami.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
right
to
have
the
event
take
place
is
purchased
in
your
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
don't
those
cases
suggest
that
maybe
this
tax
should
not
have
been
imposed
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
rather
than
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
if
you're
relying
on
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
don't
we
have
to
assume...
or
maybe
we
don't,
i
don't
know...
that
this
tax
is
properly
imposed
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
if
it
isn't,
we
surely
can
save
ourselves
a
lot
of
work.
have
you
argued
that
it's
not
imposed,
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
the
tax
is
not
collectible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
long
as
the
tax
is
imposed
on
a
customer,
how
could
they
impose...
how
could
another
state,
other
than
the
one
where
the
ticket
is
bought,
impose
a
tax?
charge
it
on
the
bus?
i
mean--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--on
the
passenger.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
would
that
work?
you
get
on
the
bus
in
oklahoma
city
to
get
off
in
minneapolis.
you
buy
your
ticket,
you
pay
the
sales
tax.
how
would
minneapolis
collect
a
use
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
passenger,
by--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--when
they
get
off
the
bus.
i
see.
