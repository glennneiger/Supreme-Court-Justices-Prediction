we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
93-1677,
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
v.
jefferson
lines,
inc.
mr.
johnston.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
exactly
what
is
the
provision
of
the
oklahoma
tax,
because
in
answer
to
that
question
of
justice
stevens,
you
said
if
it
applies
to
transportation,
but
then
certainly
a
super
bowl
ticket
to
admit
one
into
the
super
bowl
doesn't
deal
with
transportation.
what
is
the
relevant
provision
of
the
oklahoma
tax
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
would
that
reach
tickets
to
the
super
bowl?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
johnston.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
deruyter,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a...
supposing
your
bus
company
has
a
route
from
oklahoma
city
to
dallas,
and
the
bus
fills
up
in
oklahoma
city
with
gas,
enough
to
take
it
to
dallas,
now
can
oklahoma
tax
the
entirety
of
that
purchase
of
gas
even
though
a
lot
of
it
is
going
to
be
used
for
transportation
in
texas?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
taxable
event
in
minneapolis
is
alighting
from
the
bus?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
wouldn't
be
taxing
the
full
value
of
the
ticket
in
minnesota,
you
would
just
be
taxing
an
aliquot
share
based
on
mileage?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
deruyter.
the
case
is
submitted.
