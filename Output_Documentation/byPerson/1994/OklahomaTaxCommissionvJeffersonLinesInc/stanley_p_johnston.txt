mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
the
court
today
is
the
question
of
whether
the
state
of
oklahoma
may
constitutionally
impose
on
the
in-state
purchaser
and
require
the
in-state
vendor
to
collect
a
sales
tax
on
the
purchase
of
bus
transportation
sold
within
the
state,
the
tax
being
measured
by
the
full
purchase
price
of
the
ticket
even
though
the
ultimate
destination
of
the
trip,
or
a
portion
thereof,
is
to
be
traveled
beyond
the
state's
borders.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
basically
very
simple.
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
a
general
sales
tax
which
taxes
the
sale
of
tangible
personal
property
and
certain
services,
including
bus
transportation
by
common
carriers.
this
tax,
as
most
or
all
common
sales
taxes,
is
imposed
upon
the
consumer,
is
collected
by
the
vendor,
it
is
a
percentage
of
the
purchase
price,
and
is
added
to
that.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
under--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
your
honor,
i
believe
it
would
if
the
sale
occurs
in
oklahoma
under
the
statute.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
yes.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
yes,
your
honor,
it
would.
under
the
statute,
if
the
sale
occurs
in
oklahoma,
then
the
transaction
is
taxable
in
oklahoma.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
they
are
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
under
the
stipulations
that
are
in
the
joint
appendix,
beginning
at
page
3,
the
intrastate
routes
and
interstate
routes
that
are
operated
or
were
operated
by
jefferson
involve...
the
intrastate
being,
of
course,
totally
within
the
state
of
oklahoma,
and
according
to
the
stipulation
the
only
sales
involved
in
this
case
were
those
which
originated
in
oklahoma
and
terminated
outside
of
the
state.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i...
my
memory
of
the
opinion
was
that
it
did
recognize
that
jefferson
sold
other
types
of
interstate
trips
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
for
instance,
round
trips
would
be
one
type.
the
stipulation
wasn't
part
of
that,
but
that
was
a
stipulation
that
is
in
the
record,
that
these
sales,
the
exact
sales
in
question
in
this
case
were
all
those
which
originated
in
oklahoma
and
extended
outside
the
state,
or
had
a
destination
outside
the
state.
in
that
respect,
jefferson,
while
operating
in
oklahoma
and
selling
its
bus
trips
and
selling
its
bus
tickets
from
various
outlets
and
locations
across
the
state
for
both
intrastate
and
interstate
trips...
that
is,
extending
beyond
the
state's
borders,
collected
sales
tax
only
on
those
bus
tickets
which
were
sold
for
intrastate
trips.
jefferson,
of
course,
had
a
sales
tax
permit
issued
by...
as
a
vendor
by
the
state
of
oklahoma,
the
oklahoma
tax
commission,
and
dutifully
reported
all
sales
made
in
oklahoma,
both
intrastate
and
interstate
trips.
on
the
sales
tax
report,
however,
jefferson
then
deducted
those
sales
which
were
connected
with
interstate
trips,
did
not
collect
or
remit
sales
taxes
on
those
sales,
only
the
net.
jefferson
filed
for
bankruptcy,
and
office
audits
by
the
tax
commission
of
jefferson's
sales
tax
report
developed
that
the
interstate
trips,
the
tax
was
not
being
collected
or
remitted,
and
a
claim
was
filed.
jefferson
objected
in
the
bankruptcy
court
to
the
claim.
the
bankruptcy
court
sustained
jefferson's
claim
that
it
violated...
that
the
tax
on
these
trips
violated
the
commerce
clause.
the
court,
of
course,
analyzed
the
state
tax
in
view
of
the
four-prong
test
of
complete
auto.
analyzing
and
realizing
that
jefferson
is
physically
present
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
when
it
makes
all
of
these
bus
sales,
these
ticket
sales,
and
that
jefferson's
customers
are
physically
present
in
the
state
when
the
sale
is
made,
the
bankruptcy
court
found
that
this
presence
satisfied
both
the
nexus
requirement
of
complete
auto
and
also
established
that
the
state
was
providing
services
both
to
jefferson
and
to
its
customers
in
connection
with
the
sales
transaction,
and
therefore
the
fourth
prong
was
satisfied
that
the
tax
was
fairly
related
to
services
provided
by
the
taxing
state.
as
to
the
second
prong
of
the
complete
auto
test,
however,
that
the
tax
be
fairly
apportioned,
the
court
looked
at
the
accepted
test
of
whether
or
not
the
tax
is
internally
consistent.
that
is
whether,
if
every
other
state
enacted
the
same
tax,
would
there
be
multiple
or
double
taxation.
the
court
found
that
there
is
not,
because,
of
course,
a
bus
ticket
can
be
sold
in
only
one
state.
as
to
the
second
portion,
however,
the
bankruptcy
court
determined
that
the
tax
as
it
applies
to
interstate
trips
was
not
fully...
fairly
apportioned
because
the
court
envisioned
that
the
tax
was
essentially
the
same
as
the
tax
in
a
prior
case,
central
greyhound
lines
v.
mealey.
however,
in
the
case
before
this
court
today,
we
are
talking
about
a
sales
tax.
it
is
a
tax
on
the
consumer.
the
taxable
transaction
is
the
sale
itself,
and
it
is
not
the
thing
that
is
purchased
or
the
use
of
the
thing
purchased.
in
central
greyhound--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--i...
it's
incorrect
under
the
law,
your
honor,
and
you're
speaking
of
the
greyhound
case,
which
is
an
almost
identical
case
which
is
currently
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit.
the
stipulations
in
that
case
were
a
bit
broader
than
the
stipulations.
they
did
not
restrict
themselves
to
trips,
only
to
trips
originating
in
oklahoma
and
terminating
outside
insofar
as
interstate
trips
are
concerned,
but
the...
i'm
sorry--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
under
the
statute
and
under
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
decisions
the
oklahoma
sales
tax
is
effective
and
applicable
only
if
the
sale
occurs
in
oklahoma,
and
in
this
case,
that
is
if
the
trip
is
sold
in
oklahoma.
that
is,
if
i
go
and
buy
a
ticket.
i'm
not
talking,
of
course,
just
the
piece
of
paper
but
what
the
ticket
represents
and,
of
course,
in
common
parlance
one
does
not
buy
transportation
to
new
york,
one
buys
a
ticket
to
new
york.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
that's
just
flat
wrong,
your
honor.
under
the
statute
and
under
the
supreme
court
decisions
in
regard
to
the
oklahoma
sales
tax,
the
sale
to
be
taxable
in
oklahoma
must
occur
in
oklahoma.
it
cannot
occur
outside
the
state.
it
simply
doesn't
apply.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
would,
because
my
memory
of
the
statute
is
that
it
does
tax
admission
to
places
of
amusement,
and
if
the
sale
were
made
in
oklahoma,
then
it
would
be
taxable
in
oklahoma,
because,
as
with
the
super
bowl
ticket
or
a
bus
ticket,
the
way
people
purchase
these
services--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--not
in
such
circumstances,
where
you
have
certainly
physical
evidence
in
the
form
of
the
ticket,
but
legal
evidence
where
the
service
is
bought
and
paid
for
and
at
that
point
the
purchaser
has
the
right
to
the
service
and
the
right
to
do
with
that
service
as
he
will.
the
ticket,
for
instance,
whether
it
be
a
football
game
or
a
bus
ticket,
the
purchaser
once
they
buy
and
pay
for
the
ticket
they
can
give
it
away,
they
could
sell
it,
i
suppose
they
could
leave
it
in
a
will.
in
either
case,
i
would
also
suggest
that
the
ticket
doesn't
have
to
be
used.
the
service
doesn't
have
to
be
enjoyed
for
the
transaction
to
have
occurred
and
for
the
transaction
to
be
taxable.
in
this
case,
the
transportation
involved
doesn't
have
to
be
used.
it
is
not
a
tax
on
transportation,
and
that
is
the
error
of
the
courts
below
in
their
reliance
upon
central
greyhound
lines
v.
mealey,
because
that
was
a
tax
on
the
revenues
from
transportation.
it
was
tax...
a
gross
income
tax
on
the
bus
company.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
if
it's
in
regard
to
transportation?
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
yes,
sir,
under
this
statute.
if
the
sale
occurs
there,
and
it
would
be
in
that
case,
as
i
understand
the
question,
then
it
would
be
taxable,
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
as
to
transportation
it
is...
and
that's
contained
on
pages
2
and
3
of
the
brief
for
petitioner...
in
section
1354,
title
68
of
the
oklahoma
statutes
is
the
general
levying
statute,
which
levies
the
sales
tax
of
4
percent,
it
is
now
4-1/2
percent
of
the
gross
receipts
or
gross
proceeds
of
sale
of
a)
tangible
personal
property,
c)
transportation
for
hire
to
persons
by
common
carriers...
i've
omitted
the
rest
of
that,
but
it
includes--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--in
other
sections
or
subsections,
rather,
of
the
sales
tax
statute,
the
tax
is
levied
on
the
sale
of
admission
to
amusement...
sports
and
amusement
places.
i
thought
i
had
made
that
clear.
but
it
is
not
in
this
subsection,
but
it
is
within
the
taxing
statute
as
a
specifically
enumerated
service.
the
courts
below,
both
the
bankruptcy
court,
or
all
three
of
the
courts,
the
bankruptcy
court,
the
district
court
on
appeal,
and
then
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeal,
all
held
that
the
tax
was
not
fairly
apportioned
under
the
external
consistency
test.
all
three,
however,
based
their
decisions
and
relied
upon
the
case
of
central
greyhounds
v.
mealey.
as
i
believe
i
earlier
said,
this
was...
that
case
involved
a
different
kind
of
a
tax,
a
different
kind
of
a
taxpayer,
on
a
totally
different
transaction.
the
district
court,
i
believe
it
was,
indicated
that
it
found
no
substantial
difference
between
a
sales
tax
in
this
case
and
a
gross
income
tax
in
the
central
greyhound
case.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
if
it
had
been
a
sales
tax
on
the
consumer
as
opposed
to
an
income
tax
on
the
provider
of
the
service,
then
i
believe
that
the
focus
of
the
constitutional
examination
which
looks
at
the
transaction
would
be
looking
at
the
transaction
involving
the
consumer
and
his
purchase,
as
opposed
to
the
bus
company
and
taxing
its
revenues
from
the
providing
of
the
service,
and
that,
i
believe,
is
the
difference.
if
it
had
been
a
different
tax,
i
believe...
if
it
had
been
a
tax
similar
to
this,
then
the
results
would
have
been
different.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
it
is,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
under
all
the
precedents
you
have
to
look
at
the
transaction
that
is
being
taxed.
in
this
situation,
the
transaction
that
is
being
taxed
is
the
purchase
of
the
service,
not
the
providing
of
the
service
nor
the
making
of
money
from
the
providing
of
the
service.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
only
difference.
it
certainly
has
that
similarity,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i'm
afraid
i'm
not...
i'm
not
aware
that
there
was.
if
there
was,
i'm
not
aware--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--because
in
central
greyhound
we
are
talking
about
taxing
the
bus
company
on
its
revenues,
its
gross
receipts
in
that
case,
not
net
revenues,
but
from
the
providing
of...
providing
its
own
income,
the
generation
of
income,
in
that
case
more
than
one
state.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
in
this
case
the
bus
company
is
not
only
permitted
to
do
that,
it
is
required.
it's
a
provision
of
the
statute.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i
think
that's
not
only
correct,
your
honor,
but
it
also
is
constitutionally
significant,
because--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--it
is
the
primary
difference,
yes,
sir.
as
far
as
the
economic
result
of
an
income
tax
for
a
corporation,
of
course,
it
is
basically
always
going
to
trickle
down
to
its
customers
in
the
form
of
higher
prices
for
whatever
the
corporation
is
doing.
however,
the
tax
on
the
corporation's
income,
even
though
the
ultimate
cost
of
that
tax
may
eventually
increase
the
cost
of
its
services
to
the
customers,
for
instance
in
the
liggett
&
myers
case,
that
does
not,
according
to
the
court,
make
that
a
tax
on
the
customer,
and
i
believe
we
have--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--central
greyhound
was,
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
the
difference
is,
as
far
as
oklahoma's
interest,
is
that
oklahoma
is
levying
a
transaction
tax
on
the
purchaser
in
oklahoma
and
not
on
the
bus
company.
that
transaction
occurs
totally
within
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
nowhere
else.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i
would
doubt
it.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i
think
that
the
difference
as
it
applies
to
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that
in
the
case
of
tangible
personal
property,
a
sales
tax
on
that,
you're
taxing
the
transfer
of
the
title
or
possession
of
that
personal
property.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
the
question
is,
is
where
does
it
occur?
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
under
that
situation,
your
honor,
yes,
i
believe
there
is,
because
if
the
sale
of
a
ticket
that
represents
the
right
to
the
bus
trip
on
behalf
of
the
customer,
if
that
sale
occurs
in
massachusetts,
according
to
your
example,
then
the
transaction
whereby
i
purchase
and
acquire
all
the
rights
to
the
thing
that
i
have
purchased,
that
occurs
in
massachusetts,
and
if
massachusetts
has
the
oklahoma-type
sales
tax,
then
it's
taxable
there,
i
submit.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--yes,
your
honor.
i
made
the
distinction
only
between
tangible
personal
property
and
service
to
this
extent,
that
it's
well
settled
that
for
tangible
personal
property
you
have
the
delivery
of
either
title
or
possession.
that
is...
and
the
right
to
control.
in
the
situation
of
the
bus
ticket
and
intangibles,
intangible
services,
then
we
are
talking
about
the
same
transaction,
it's
the
same
transfer,
but
it
is
the
right
to
have
and
control
that
service,
not
necessarily
the
ultimate
enjoyment.
for
instance,
it
is
not
the
tax
on
the
eating
of
the
apple
or
the
riding
of
the
bus.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i
believe
you
have,
your
honor.
yes,
you
have.
if
that's--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--the
only--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
that
is
what
the
stipulation
covers,
and
that's
all
it
covers,
your
honor.
i
have
no
doubt
that
it's
possible
for
the
sales
that
were
reported
during
these
periods
by
jefferson,
some
of
them
may
have
been
round
trips...
round
trip...
round
trips
out
of
the
state
and
back
in.
i
do
not
know.
the
record
doesn't
reflect
it.
the
only
stipulation
is
what
we
have
before
us.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
your
honor,
i--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--if
your
honor...
if
i
understand,
this
would
be,
for
instance--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--a
sale
in
oklahoma--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--of
something
that
occurred
totally
outside.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
yes.
your
honor,
it...
under
the
statute,
if
under
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
the
sale
occurred,
then
i
believe
that
where
the
service
were
employed
or
enjoyed
would
not
make
a
difference
under
the
statute.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
if
a
sale
were...
if
i
ordered
the
apple
to
be
delivered
from
one
state
to
another
state--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--there
is
a
question
in
my
mind
whether
in
that
case,
although
you're
assuming
the
complete...
the
sale
in
oklahoma.
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
an
oklahoma
sale
in
that
case.
the...
for
instance,
in
the--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--because
in
the
super
bowl
problem,
as
the
question
was
posed,
the
sale
was
completed.
that
is,
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
both
parties
were
there,
and
the
transfer
of
the
ticket
representing
the
service
and
giving
the
right
to
the
service
was
transferred
from
one
to
the
other
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
so
as
i
understood
the
question,
all
of
the
transaction
as
far
as
the
right
to
the
service
occurred
within
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
the
cases
with
which
i
am
familiar
do
require
that
there
be
some
sort
of
delivery,
the
completion,
although
the
statute
requires
transfer
of
either
title
or
possession
in
the
state.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
the
mcgoldrick--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--the
mcgoldrick
case
would
be
one
case,
your
honor,
because
the
agreement
was
made
first,
then
the
coal
was
mined
or
released,
then
it
was
shipped
from
a
place
out
of
state
into
new
york,
and
actual
physical
delivery
of
the
coal
to
the
buying
customer
was
made
in
new
york,
so
the
interstate
portion
of
that
delivery
the
court
found
to
be
basically
incidental
and
not
violative
of
interstate
commerce.
other
cases
to
which
we
would
point
the
court's
attention,
and
we
have
in
the
brief,
are
those
situations
involving,
for
instance,
airline
fuel
in
wardair
canada.
although
the
fuel
was
delivered
and
sold
to
the
airline
in
the
state
of
florida,
it
was
actually
used
primarily
out
of
the
state
of
florida.
the
courts
nevertheless
found
that
it
was
taxable
certainly
for
domestic
commerce
clause
purposes.
there
was,
of
course,
the
foreign
commerce
clause
additional
considerations.
and
the
similar
situation
in
the
itel
containers,
where
the
containers
leased
were
used
exclusively
in
foreign
commerce
and,
of
course,
we
believe
that
the
decision
in
goldberg
v.
sweet
involving
the
telephone
calls
is
very
similar
to
the
situation
in
this
case,
because
in
effect
you
had
a
tax
there
very
similar
to
a
sales
tax.
it
was
of
an
intangible
service.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
i
believe
because
of
the
circumstances
or
the
nature
of
that
transaction,
and
the
statute
provided
the
possibility
as
the
court
noted,
although
i
believe
the
court
said
that
there
was
a
very,
very
slight
possibility,
but
a
possibility,
that
an
interstate
telephone
call
could
be
subject
to
tax
in
two
states,
but
only
two
states,
and
the
court
then,
of
course,
observed
that
even
if
there
was
that
slight
possibility,
then
the
credit
provision
would
act
to
take
care
to
avoid
any
actual
multiple
taxation.
i
believe
in
this
case
that
where
you
have
the
transaction...
i
don't
believe
any
other
state
would
have
nexus
to
tax
the
transaction
that
we're
talking
about
here,
and
that
is
the
sale
of
the
trip.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
it
could.
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
it
could
in
that
event,
your
honor,
as
i
believe
most
bus
companies
are
entitled
to
various
taxes,
and
certainly
income
taxes.
under
the
scenario
that
is
adopted
by
the
courts
below,
if
one
state
taxed
a
bus
company
and
another
state
taxed
a
customer,
that
amounts
to
multiple
taxation,
then
obviously
one
of
those
taxes
has
to
go,
and
that
i
believe
is
not...
this
is
not
what
the
law
says,
and
it's
certainly
not
what
we
have
today.
most
companies,
if
not
all
companies,
are
subject
to
taxes
on
their
income
along
with
other
taxes.
this
does
not,
under
the
commerce
clause,
however,
prevent
states
from
taxing
their
customers
when
those
customers
buy
products
from
those
companies.
i
believe
the
two
different
types
of
taxes
are
not
equatable
and,
therefore,
in
this
case
we
do
not
have
the,
even
the--
mr.
stanley
p.
johnston
--thank
you.
