mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
practical
effect
of
this
tax
and
the
express
language
of
the
taxing
statute
are
the
same.
this
is
a
tax
on
interstate
bus
transportation.
however
the
state
of
oklahoma
may
attempt
to
labelize
or
localize
the
activity
which
it
seeks
to
impose
its
tax,
this
is
a
tax
on
interstate
activities
which
occur
far
beyond
the
borders
of
that
state.
now,
the
lower--
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
--this
court
has
held
that
income
tax
must
be
fairly
apportioned
and
has
dealt
with
a
number
of
apportionment
formulae
which
it
requires
that
income
taxes
be
subjected
to,
so
the
answer
to
that--
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
--it
is
not
exempt,
no.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
i
am
not
saying
that
a
sales
tax
cannot
be
imposed
on
interstate
transportation.
i
am
simply
saying
that
when
it
is
imposed
on
interstate
transportation
it
must
follow
the
precedents
of
this
court,
the
complete
auto
requirement
of
fair
apportionment.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
yes.
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
because
the
total
delivery
of
possession
of
that
gas
is
made
within
the
state
of
oklahoma.
that's
similar
to
the
itel
case
and
mcgoldrick
and
a
number
of
cases
where
this
court,
as
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
said,
the
delivery
of
possession
and
title,
but
principally
delivery
of
possession,
gives
a
state
the
right
to
impose
a
tax.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
that's
similar
to
what...
the
situation
that
this
court
dealt
with
in
goldberg.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
the
court
held
there,
based
on
the
particular,
different
facts
from
this
one,
that--
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
--you
held
that
the
state
could
tax
that
service
address.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
that's--
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
--that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
the
finding
of
the
court
in
goldberg...
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
this
case
is
different
than
the
goldberg
situation.
the
court
in
that
case
made
a
finding
based
on
the
facts
that
there
was
an
administrative
impossibility
of
apportionment.
here,
by
contrast,
and
we
cite
the
central--
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
--there
were
parties
to
that
case
that
argued
that...
that
it
was
administratively
feasible
in
goldberg
to
apportion
the
tax
between
the
states,
but
the
court
found,
as
part
of
its
decision,
that
it
was
administratively
impossible.
here
we
have
the
contrast
where
this
court
in
a
number
of
situations
has
held
that
it
is
not
only
administratively
possible
but
has
approved
judicially
the
apportionment
on
the
basis
of
mileage.
in
fact,
in
complete
auto
itself,
the
court
indicated
that
it
was
fairly
apportioned
because
it
only
applied
to
transportation
within
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
i
believe
that--
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
--i
believe
that
that
should
not
be
subject
to
the
oklahoma
tax
because,
assuming
that
you
find
that
the
super
bowl
ticket
is
a
service,
a
performance,
then
the
place
where
the
service
is
performed
is
the
place
that
may...
that
has
the
jurisdiction
to
impose
a
tax.
that
is
what
the...
by
the
way,
the
state
of
oklahoma
supreme
court
in
the
pioneer
telephone
case
has
so
held.
it
has
held
that
the
place
of
delivery
of
possession
is
the
place
where
goods
may
be
taxed,
but
the
place
of
performance
is
the
place
that
can
tax
a
service.
interestingly,
that
case,
plus
the
tad
screen
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
are
never
dealt
with
by
the
commission
in
their
briefs
or
in
its
argument
before
this
court.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
we're
arguing
both,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
i
don't
believe
we
have.
we've
argued
in
our
brief
that
the
manner
in
which
the
state
has
applied
the
tax
to
jefferson
bus
lines
is
inappropriate
because
they
have
argued
that
they
can
impose
their
tax
on
the
sale
of
a
ticket,
the
transaction
or
the
payment,
it's
not
clear,
rather
than
on
the
delivery
of
the
service,
which
is
the
operating
incidence,
the
object
of
the
tax,
and
therefore
we
have
argued
that
as
applied,
this
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
no,
we
have
not
shown
that.
that...
that
would
be
a
different
case.
it
is
not
before
the
court,
and
what
they're...
i
mean,
what
they're
suggesting
is
that
by
applying
a
use
tax
in
combination
with
the
sales
tax
only
to
all
miles
traveled
within
the
state,
they're
suggesting
that
they
would...
they
would
get
equal
or
more
tax
than
they're
getting
here.
that
argument,
that
averaging
argument
has
not
been
sustained
by
this
court.
i
think
this
spring
in
associated
industries
the
argument
was
made
that
a
use
tax
on
average
was
fair,
but
this
court
held
that
that
kind
of
analysis
was
not
appropriate,
that
you
must
look
at
the
individual
taxpayer,
and
that
is
where
it
is
significant
that
the
tax
here
is
imposed
upon
the
individual
passenger,
because
to
say
on
average,
passengers
are
not
discriminated
against
or
unfairly
apportioned
does
not
solve
he
dilemma
of
the
individual
passenger.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
if
the
tax...
the
answer
is
yes,
assuming
the
tax
is
imposed
on
the
delivery
of
the
rental
itself
as
opposed
to
the
situation
in,
i
believe
it
was
itel
where
they...
there
was
a
lease
of
containers,
but
they
said
the
tax
was
imposed
on
the
delivery
of
possession.
if
the
tax
is
like
itel,
then
the
answer
would
be
different,
but
if
the
tax
is
imposed
on
the
lease,
then
you
should
have
an
apportionment.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
that
is
correct.
that
is
what
i
do
with
the
state
of
south
dakota.
i
allocate
my
bills
to
clients
that
i
bill
in
south
dakota
on
the
portion
of
the
services
that
i
do
in
minnesota.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
but
we
are
required--
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
--yes.
i
look
at
evco,
ingram-richardson,
decisions
of
this
court
which
dealt
with
services
rendered
wholly
within
one
state,
and
the
court
said
the
tax
is
properly
imposed
because
all
of
the
services
were
rendered
within
a
single
state.
the
same
thing
in
complete
auto.
there
just
has
not
been
the
case
that
at
least
i'm
aware
of
where
you
have
services
rendered
across
state
lines
as
you
have
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
goldberg,
as
i
indicated,
administratively
impossible.
there
the
court
said
that
there
were
only
two
states
that
could
impose
the...
that
had
the
nexus
to
impose
the
tax,
and
they
also
said
that
to
the
extent
there
was
a
credit
mechanism
there
could
be
no
multiple
taxation,
and
therefore
in
discussing
the
apportionment
aspect
of
complete
auto,
the
court
said
that...
that
the...
that
the
way
the
telephone
calls
were
made
were...
the
way
people
understood
the
use
of
the
telephone
was
consistent
with
applying
a
tax
on
the
user
in
the
state.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
i
believe
that
you
do,
that
by
saying
that
you
impose
a
tax
on
the
sale
of
the
ticket,
at
bottom
what
you
are
saying
is
that
you
are
imposing
a
tax
on
the
contract,
making
of
the
contract
and
the
making
of
the
payment.
in
this
case,
we
happen
to
have
a
coincidence
of
the
making
of
the
contract
and
the
making
of
the
payment
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
but
it
would
be
quite
simple...
i
mean,
obvious
in
a
different
situation.
i
think
justice
breyer
has
given
us
an
example--
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
--no
other
view
can
tax
the
act
of
making
the
sale.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
however,
i'm...
the...
this
court
has
said
you
must
look
at
the
operating
incidence
of
the
tax.
the
operating
incidence
of
this
tax
is
on
the
measure
of
the
tax,
and
the
measure
of
the
tax
is
the
gross
receipts
from
the
total
trip,
and
therefore
our
argument
is
that
the...
the
argument
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
is
too
narrow,
that
you
can't
look
only
at
the
actual
transaction,
but
you
must
look
at
the
operating
incidence
of
the
tax,
and
that
is
clearly
on
the
total
gross
receipts,
which
is
not
apportioned.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
the
determination
of
an
apportionment
formula
is
in
essence
a
legislative
decision.
there
is
in
this
case...
to
answer
the
goldberg
situation,
there
is
in
this
factual
situation
an
administratively
feasible
method
of
apportionment
which
is
judicially
sanctioned,
and
that's
what
we're
saying.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
which
is
mileage.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
i
agree
in
a
theoretical
sense
that
that
is
a
legislative
decision.
we're
not
asking
the
court--
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
--i
certainly
believe
that
apportionment
on
the
basis
of
mileage
is
not
only
feasible
but
judicially
sanctioned,
and
it
was
referenced
as
such
in
the
illinois
decision,
citing
central
greyhound
v.
mealey.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
we
argue
that
our
position
is
consistent.
in
the
mcgoldrick
berwind-white
case,
the
state
is
allowed
to
impose
a
tax
on
the
full
sale
price
of
the
delivery
of
possession
of
the
good.
that
is
the
entire
object
of
the
transaction.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
applying
that
same
rule
to
the
delivery
of
services,
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
impose
a
tax
on
the
object
of
the
transaction,
which
is
the
delivery
of
the
services
where
those
services
occur,
and
only
the
portion
of
those
services
that
occur
in
the
taxing
state
can
that
state
tax.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
no.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
combination
of
states
in
which
the
service
is
performed
in
total
can
tax
100
percent
of
the
value
of
the
service.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
assuming...
oklahoma
and
texas
in
combination
can
tax
100
percent
of
the
value
of
that--
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
--i
go
back
to
what
this
court
has
said
in
those
delivery
of
goods
cases,
that
the
object
of
the
transaction
is
the
delivery
of
the
good.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
because
when
a
person
purchases
a
ticket,
they
don't
have
the
full
right
to
the
object
of
that
transaction.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
believe
that
the
delivery
of
the
good
cases
essentially
say
that
when
a
purchaser
of
goods
has
complete
dominion
and
control
on
those
goods,
the
transaction
is
complete,
whereas
in
the
purchase
of
a
service,
the
dominion
and
control
of
the
object
of
that
transaction
can
never
be
complete
until
the
passenger
completes
their
travel,
and
if
that
is
interrupted
in
the
middle,
they
have
a
right
to
a
refund
of
the
portion
of
the
sales
tax,
on
the
portion
of
the
trip
they
didn't
complete.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
travel
agent
is
simply
an
agent
in
that
situation,
either
for
the
passenger
or
for
jefferson
lines,
and
it
should
not
make
a
difference
on
how
the
transaction
is
taxed.
the
object
of
the
transaction,
the
object
of
the
tax
and
the
tax
is
not
laid
on
the
travel
agency
but
rather
it's
laid
on
the
passenger,
the
user
of
the
service,
so
i
think
the
answer
is
that
it
passes
through
the
travel
agency.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
i
think
airline
tickets
are...
congress
has
acted
in
that
area,
but--
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
--right.
right.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
jefferson
operates
on
routes
that
basically
go
north
and
south
from
the
state
of
minnesota.
the
only
state
that
we're
aware
of
in
that
system
that
imposes
a
tax
on
bus
transportation
is
the
state
of
missouri,
which
imposes
a
tax
applicable
only
on
intrastate
tickets.
in
other
words,
they
only
impose
their
tax
on
a
ticket
purchased
for
travel
beginning
and
ending
within
the
state
of
missouri,
never
touching
another
state.
other
than
that,
there
may
be
two
or
three
other
states
throughout
the
country
that
seek
to
impose
a
tax
on
bus
transportation.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
yes.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
yes,
if
they
were
all
delivered
to
new
york.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
exactly.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
i
can't
answer
your
question
without
reference
to
the
goldberg
decision.
there,
they
only
imposed
the
tax
on
calls
charged
to
a
service
address
in
illinois,
so
there
would
not
be
a
tax
on
a
call
that
was
charged
to
a
service
address
in
new
york.
that's
the
first
part
of
that
answer.
secondly,
they
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
was
administratively
impossible
to
allocate...
you
know,
where
the
service
was
performed.
if...
and
i
submit,
if
another
case
came
up,
technology
has
changed
that
they
can
allocate
that
telephone
service,
then
i
would
argue
that
telephone
case
would
be
similar
to
the
case
we
have
before
the
court
today.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
i
think--
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
--are
we
talking
buses
now
or
telephones?
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
if
we're
talking
telephones,
the...
that's
similar
to
a
tax
that
we
cite
in
our
materials,
the
case
out
of
florida,
and
that's
exactly
what
they
did,
and
that
might
be
an
appropriate
apportionment.
what
this
court
held
in
goldberg
was
that
the
state
of
illinois
could
impose
a
tax
on
100
percent
of
the
fees
charged
to
a
service
address
in
illinois.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
exactly.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
i've
thought
about...
i
thought
about...
you
know,
when
i've
read
goldberg,
my
view
of
that
is
simply
that
i
don't
think
the
state
of
oklahoma
argues
that
apportionment
on
a
mileage
basis
is
difficult,
or
impossible
to
do.
they
simply
argue
it's
not
relevant
in
this
case.
as
opposed
to
the
telephone
situation,
as
i
indicated
before,
if
the
facts
were
different
in
goldberg
i
think
the
result
might
have
been
different
in
goldberg,
and
if
you
have
the
technology
to
allocate
to
states
where
there's
a
real
nexus
to
tax
in
goldberg,
i
think
you
might
have
a
different...
my
view
of
it,
there
would
be
a
different
result.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
you
are
correct.
we
have
not
shown
actual
multiple
taxation.
we
suggest
that
there's
a
high
possibility,
particularly
once
the
states
read
the
decision
in
this
case,
for
other
states
to
impose
use
taxes
or
sales
taxes
with
the
same
language
that
we
have
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
the
tax
here
is
on
the
rendering
and
furnishing
of
services.
they
could
impose
that
or
a
gross
receipts
tax
where
a
credit
mechanism,
for
example,
would
not--
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
--how
could
another
state
impose
a
tax
on
the
customer?
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
on
the
passenger.
a
use
tax,
for
example.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
minnesota
would
simply
audit
the
tickets
purchased
outside
the
state
and
ask
for
an
allocation
on
the...
assuming
mileage--
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
--impose
it
on
the
passenger,
require
that
the
bus
company
collect
the
tax.
that's
typical
use
tax.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
not
when
they
get
off
the
bus.
the
passenger
would
have
it...
would
have
it
collected
by
jefferson,
you
know,
when
he
bought
the
ticket
in
oklahoma.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
no.
the
taxable
event
in
minnesota
is
the
travel
which
commences
at
the
iowa
border
and
concludes
at
the
terminal
wherever
they
get
off.
mr.
steven
d.
deruyter
that's
what
i
would
suggest.
however,
if
minnesota
adopted
a
sales
tax
statute
identical
to
the
tax
statute
before
the
court,
i
believe
that
there's
no
apportionment.
they
could
impose
a
tax
on
the
full
value.
