justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are
the
case
authorities
that
you
can
point
us
to
that
require
this
distinction
between
tangible
services
and
the
sale
of
goods,
or
intangible
services,
rather,
and
the
sale
of
goods?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
you're
sticking
with
that
distinction
so
that
if
oklahoma
tries
to
tax
a
sale
for
goods
that
are
shipped
and
delivered
in
other
states,
the
shipment
outside
of
oklahoma,
the
delivery
outside
of
oklahoma,
the
receipt
outside
of
oklahoma
but
the
sale
in
oklahoma,
i
take
it
you
say
that's
not
taxable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--this
is
the
apple.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
breyer's
apple
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
if
this
service
were
for
the
delivery
of
tangible
property?
i
mean,
it's
hard
to
call
that
a
service.
the
apple
hypothetical,
are
you
sticking
with
the
answer
that
that
is
not
taxable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
complete
the
sale
in
oklahoma,
but
the
apples
are
going
to
be
shipped
from
washington
to
california.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
is
that
different
from
justice
stevens'
super
bowl
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
assume
the
same
thing
happens
with
the
apple
hypothetical.
the
deal
is
made,
signed,
sealed,
completed
in
oklahoma,
and
delivery
and
receipt
to
take
place
outside
of
oklahoma,
delivery
of
the
goods
that
are
the
subject
of
the
completed
sales
contract.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
is
that
the
mcgoldrick
case?
what
are
the
cases
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
can
point
us
to
from
this
court
that
require
us
to
make
a
distinction
between
services
and
tangible
goods,
if
that's
the
distinction
you
want
us
to
make?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
theory,
i
take
it
all
sales
taxes
on
rent-a-cars
have
to
be
apportioned
to
the
extent
the
rent-a-car's
being
driven
out
of
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
same
if
you
hire
an
attorney
in
one
state
but
all
of
the
services
really
involve
his
or
her
traveling
out
of
state
to
make
a
report
and
a
recommendation,
if
there's
a
state
service
tax
that
has
to
be
apportioned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
are
you
coming
out
on
that
with
the
state,
pretty
well?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
think
constitutionally
this
is
required?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
apportionment
formula
that
you
suggest
is
mileage
traveled
in
each
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
is
mileage?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
that
a
person
transfers.
he
takes
the
bus
from
oklahoma
to
st.
louis,
and
then
has
to
transfer
and
spends
a
lot
of
time
in
st.
louis.
it
would
be
like
an
airline
hub,
changing
to
a
different
bus
to
go
on,
say,
i
don't
know,
to
new
orleans.
couldn't
missouri
argue,
well,
it's
not
just
miles,
because
there
was
a
hub
here,
and
there
was
a
bus
change
so
we
get
more
of
the
tax,
it's
not
just
mileage?
it
seems
to
me
that
mileage
might
not
be
administratively
feasible
or
necessarily
fair.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
not
just
a
legislative
decision
if
we're
asking
whether
or
not
the
apportionment
mechanism
is
available
and
feasible,
because
that's
what
we
need
to
distinguish
the
illinois
tax
on
telephone
calls.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
may
not
be
a
very
legally
persuasive
argument,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
oklahoma
were
right
in
this
case,
many,
many
states
would
have
enacted
sales
taxes
where
none
now
exist
on
transportation
tickets.
do
you
agree
with
that?
i
mean...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
take
it
this
is
a
unique
tax,
or
am
i
incorrect?
do
many
states
tax
the
sale
of
airline
tickets
for
interstate
travel,
for
instance?
