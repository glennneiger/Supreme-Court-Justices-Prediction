i
thought
greyhound
was
a
tax
on
the
company?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
this
is
a
tax
on
the
purchaser,
not
on
the
company?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
big
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
different
from
the
apples?
all
your
rights
to
the
apple
are
acquired
in
massachusetts.
i
really
don't
understand
the
distinction
you're
drawing.
in
fact,
i
thought
you
told
me
earlier
that
the
apple
transaction
would
be
taxed?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
make
the
distinction
for
personal
property
because
we've
held
that
the
state
where
the
contract
for
sale
is
made
cannot
impose
a
sales
tax,
haven't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it
be
the
same
for
an
income
tax
on
the
revenues
derived
from
interstate
transportation?
are
they
also
exempt?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
income
from
interstate
transportation
is
not
exempt
from
state
taxes,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
that
the...
that
a
sales
tax
cannot
be
imposed
on
interstate
transportation.
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
the
states
in
between?
there's
nobody
curled
up
anywhere.
