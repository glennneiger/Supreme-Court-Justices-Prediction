justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
johnston,
one
more
background
fact.
in
the
two
bankruptcy
proceedings
that
i
think
involved
another
bus
company
there
was
a
statement
that
you
tax
even
tickets
that
were
sold
outside
the
state.
was...
the
bankruptcy
judge
thought
that
the
tax
reached
transportation
of...
where
the
ticket
was
sold
out
of
state.
was
that
incorrect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
tax
reach,
as
the
bankruptcy
judges
seem
to
think,
transportation
sold
in
other
states,
but
that
occurs
at
least
in
part
in
oklahoma?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
this
statement,
the
statute
also
allows
oklahoma
to
tax
transportation
sold
in
other
states
which
occurs
in
oklahoma,
that's
just
flat
wrong,
is
that
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
respect
to
central
greyhound,
is
it
your
position
that
if
new
york
had
made
that
tax
a
tax
on
the
sale
of
the
ticket,
then
it
would
have
come
out
the
other
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
johnston--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
the
only
reason
for
the
distinction
i
can
see.
i'm
still
puzzled
by
the
initial
question
that
justice
o'connor
posed
and
your
answer
to
it.
you
do
have
in
the
stipulation
that
here,
interstate
routes
are
those
which
originate
in
oklahoma
and
terminate
in
a
state
other
than
oklahoma.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
does
that
stipulation
mean
that
what
we
have
been
talking
about,
a
ticket
purchased
in
oklahoma
but
for
transportation
between
states
other
than
oklahoma,
that
that
is
something
that
the
statute
purports
to
reach
but
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
only
sales
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
are
routes
that
originate
in
oklahoma
and
terminate
some
place
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
court's
stress
of
the
credit
mechanism
that
was
present
in
that
case
and
not
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
would
have...
would
be
able
to
put
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
company--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
the
miles
in
that
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
deruyter,
one
argument
that
was
made,
i
think
by
the
tax
commission,
was
that
if
they
were
able
to
tax
the
customer
who
is
traveling
on
oklahoma
roads,
set
up
tolls,
maybe,
along
the
road,
so
they
taxed
all
of
the
miles
within
oklahoma,
that
they'd
probably
net
more
than
they
are
now,
when
they're
taxing
only
the
person
who
purchased
the
ticket
in
oklahoma.
have
you
shown
that
that
is
not
so,
that
in
fact
if
they
went
on
your
theory
of
taxing
people
who
travel
the
roads
in
oklahoma,
no
matter
where
they
begin,
no
matter
where
they
end...
the
argument
is
that
they
state
would
collect
even
more
if
they
did
it
that
way.
have
you
shown
that
that's
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
deruyter,
would
you
explain
why
it
isn't
necessary
for
new
york
in
the
berwind-white
situation
to
take
off
something
because
the
coal
traveled
interstate?
new
york
can
tax
the
full
value
of
the
sale...
although
it
started
some
place
else
and
value
was
added
all
along
the
way
it's
the
place
where
it
ends
up
can
tax
the
full
value.
why
can't,
equally
with
regard
to
services,
the
place
where
it
starts
out
tax
the
full
value?
why
such
a
difference
between
the
treatment
of
goods
on
the
one
hand,
where
we
let
the
state
tax
it
all
at
the
end,
and
here,
a
similar
thing
that
the
state
can
lay
its
hands
on,
the
sale
of
the
ticket,
can
also
tax
the
whole
thing?
why
should
we
treat
those
differently?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
unlike
goods,
where
we
let
somebody
tax
the
full
value,
nobody
in
an
interstate
sale
can
tax
the
full
value
of
the
service?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
follow
that.
tell
me
who
can
tax
the
full
value
of
a
bus
trip
from
oklahoma
to
texas.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
new
york
didn't
have
to
worry
about
combining
with
anybody
in
berwind-white.
it
could
tax
the
full
value
of
the
sale.
i'm
asking
you,
and
i
think
you
answered
that
services,
yes,
one
place
could
tax
the
full
value
of
the
service
too,
but
you
have
answered
the
concrete
example
differently.
you
said
two
places
could,
but
not
one
place.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
then
making
a
distinction
between,
there
isn't
one
place
that
can
tax
in
full
a
service
that's
rendered
interstate,
unlike
goods.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
antihead
tax,
right?
i
mean,
that
you
can't
have
a
head
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
other
bus
companies?
is
oklahoma
peculiar
in
taxing
bus
tickets,
or
do
other
states
do
it,
too?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
haven't
shown
that
there's
any
multiple
taxation
in
fact
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
the
transportation,
say,
from
oklahoma
to
texas,
texas
is
not
laying
a
tax
on
that
customer
so
that
the
ticket
is
being
taxed
twice.
