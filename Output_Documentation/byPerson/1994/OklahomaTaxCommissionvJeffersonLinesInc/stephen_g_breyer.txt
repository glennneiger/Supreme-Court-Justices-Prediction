justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
does
that
make
a
difference?
i
mean,
a
state...
the
state
of
new
york
has
a
big
interest,
i
take
it,
in
the
income
that
its
own
corporations
make,
so
the
connection
between
new
york
and
its
company,
greyhound,
is
great.
here,
with
the
sales
tax,
i
guess
oklahoma
has
far
less
interest
either
in
the
company
or
in
the
trip,
so
if
there's
a
difference,
why
does
it
cut
in
your
favor?
why
doesn't
it
cut
against
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
is
it
the
case
here,
i'm
not
certain,
but
suppose
i'm
in
massachusetts
and
my
son's
at
school
in
california,
and
i
think
it
would
be
nice
to
send
him
an
apple
every
month,
so
i
get
these
things
in
the
mail
you
do,
they'll
send
washington
apples
to
california
once
a
month.
can
that
be
taxed
in
massachusetts
if
i
buy
the
apples
in
massachusetts?
they're
washington
apples
going
to
california.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer's
no,
i
take
it.
all
right.
why
is
it
any
different
if
i
buy
him
a
haircut
once
a
month?
i
mean,
suppose
i'm
in
massachusetts,
i
think
he
should
get
a
haircut
out
at
stanford,
so
there's
a
new
service,
which
there
ought
to
be,
that
they'll
give
him
a
haircut
once
a
month.
[laughter]
i
mean,
does
it
make
any
difference?
if
you
can't
tax
the
apples
going
from
washington
to
california,
why
should
you
be
able
to
tax
the
haircut?
if
you
can't
tax
the
haircut,
why
can
you
tax
the
bus
trip?
all
of
those
things
are
bought
in
massachusetts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
all
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
why
should
there
be
a
difference,
my
point
is,
between
the
apples
and
the
haircut
and
the
bus
trip?
they
all
take
place
totally
outside
the
state
of
massachusetts,
but
the
sales
of
each
take
place
within.
is
there
any
reason
they
should
be
treated
differently?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
state
of
the
art
on
this,
but
if
the...
or,
i
start
out
in
washington,
the
state
of
washington,
and
i
buy
a
bus
ticket
and
a
crate
of
apples,
and
i'm
going
to
new
york,
and
i
take
it
if
i
eat
up
the
apples
on
the
way,
all
new
york
can
tax
is
the
two
remaining
ones
that
are
with
me
in
new
york.
is
that
the
state
of
the
law
on
goods?
i
bought
the
whole
thing,
by
the
way,
in
new
york.
but
is
that
the
state
of
the
law
on
goods?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
take
it
on
services...
if
that's
the
state
of
the
law
on
goods,
then
i
take
it
on
services
it
would
be
the
same,
that
new
york
could
tax
me
on
that
portion
of
the
bus
trip
that
takes
place
in
new
york,
but
it
couldn't
tax
me
on
the
portion
in
iowa
any
more
than...
on
your
theory
any
more
than
it
could
tax
me
on
the
apples
that
i
ate
as
i
was
going
through
iowa.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
then
what
do
you
do
about
the
case
of
the
telephone
system,
because
with
the
telephones
i
can
understand
that
i'm
in
illinois,
and
i
phone
my
brother
in
new
york,
and
i
can
easily
imagine
i
got
the
service
of
talking
to
my
brother
when
i
was
in
illinois.
it's
as
if
he's
sort
of
curled
up
inside
the
receiver.
[laughter]
there's
a
voice
there,
and
i
hear
it,
and
so
forth.
but
also
the
same
thing
is
happening
in
new
york,
so
why
couldn't
you
say,
well,
look,
at
least
new
york
and
illinois
could
tax
this.
so
how
do
we
reconcile
that
case
with
what
our
theory
was
on
the
bus
with
the
apples?
that's
where
i'm
having...
i
mean,
we've
got...
i've
got
it
all
worked
out,
almost
but
not
quite.
that's--
