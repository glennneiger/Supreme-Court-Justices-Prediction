mr.
johnston,
does
oklahoma
tax
the
sale
in
oklahoma
of
bus
tickets
for
transportation
that
is
not
at
all
conducted
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
that
neither
begins
nor
ends
in
the
state
of
oklahoma?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
ticket
is
purchased
there--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
transportation
outside
the
state.
does
oklahoma
tax
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
that's
what
i
asked.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
assume
the
sale
occurs
there,
but
none
of
the
transportation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
any
such
sales
at
issue
in
this
case,
do
you
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
stipulation
seems
inconsistent
with
something
stated
in
the
bankruptcy
court
opinion,
and
i
just
didn't
know
which
one
to
think
was
the
correct
one.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
as
a
practical
matter,
what's
the
difference?
the
measure
is
the
same,
which
is
the
sale
price
of
the
ticket.
it's
exactly
the
same
measure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
a
tax
on...
an
excise
tax
on
interstate
phone
calls
made
from
or
to
an
in-state
address?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
exactly,
and
what
did
we
hold
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
didn't
we
hold
that
the
state
could
tax
those
calls?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
whole
price
of
the
call--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--including
the
portion
that
covered
the
out-of-state
use
of
the
facilities
of
the
telephone
company.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
is
this
different?
is
it
any
more
difficult
to
divide
up
or
apportion
telephone
line
charges
than
highways?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
strikes
me
as
being
insubstantial.
i
don't
see
why
it's
any
more
difficult
there
than
here.
i
would
think
you
have
exactly
the
same
thing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
justice
stevens'
super
bowl
ticket
purchase
in
oklahoma?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
apportion
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
except
for
the
telephone
calls
in
goldberg.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
say
the
taxable
event
is
the
sale
of
the
ticket,
only
one
state
can
impose
it,
isn't
that
so?
you
don't
get
the
problem
of
multiple
taxation
if
the
taxable
event
is
the
sale.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
this
situation,
what
other
state
could
tax
the
sale,
do
you
suppose?
if
the
purchase
is
made
in
oklahoma,
and
the
payment
of
the
ticket
is
made
in
oklahoma,
what
other
state
can
tax
the
sale,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
the
opinion
in
number
93-1677,
oklahoma
tax
commission
v
jefferson
lines
inc.
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
