justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
no
separate
transaction
in
central
greyhound,
is
it?
it's
simply
the
moment
at
which
you
do
the
figuring.
instead
of
saying
the
tax
is
due
when
the
ticket
is
purchased,
the
tax
is
due
when
you
add
up
all
your
gross
income
and
find
out
what
it
is.
isn't
that
the
only
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there...
was
there
any
other
kind
of
income
that
went
into
gross
income
in
central
greyhound
that
is...
in
addition
to
revenue
from
the
sale
of
transportation?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i'm
not...
then,
like
the
court
below,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
difference
is,
then.
explain
that
to
me
again.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
the
difference,
then,
that
in
the
case
of
the
tax
here,
the
bus
company
is
given
an
authorization
to
add
on
the
tax
up
front
and
state
it
as
a
tax
when
it
collects
it,
as
distinct
from
simply
dealing
with
it
as
a
cost
of
business
and
passing
it
on
sub
silentio
when
it
figures
the
price
of
its
ticket?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
realize
that,
but
is
that,
then,
the
only
distinction
between
the
two?
it's
up
front
in
one
case
and
it's
an
unstated
cost
of
doing
business
which
increases
the
cost
of
the
ticket
in
the
other
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
only
difference.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
the
object
of
the
transaction
in
this
particular
case
the
right
to
obtain
travel
services
at
some
future
time,
and
why
isn't
that
transaction
just
as
complete
as
the
transaction
when
goods
are
purchased?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
do.
they've
got
the
ticket,
and
if
the
bus
company
won't
carry
them,
they
can
sue
the
bus
company
for
damages.
i
mean,
economically,
it
seems
to
me,
they've
got
the
full
value
of
the
transaction,
and
they're
going
to
realize
that
value
either
by
traveling
or
by
making
the
bus
company
pay.
the
distinction,
i
suppose
is,
when
they
buy
the
coal,
the
people
along
the
line
responsible
for
getting
the
coal
there
no
longer
have
to
do
anything,
whereas
in
this
case
people
along
the
line
in
the
future
do
have
to
do
something.
either
they've
got
to
carry
them
on
the
bus,
or
they've
got
to
pay
up
in
some
way,
but
the
fact
is
the
right
to
the
service
is
what
he's
buying,
and
i
would
suppose
that
right
is
complete
once
he
pays
the
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
agree,
then,
that
if
the
bus
company
were
selling
the
tickets
in
the
first
place
to
travel
agents
and
travel
agents
were
then
selling
them
to
the
travelers,
that
at
least
the
transaction
as
between
the
bus
company
and
the
travel
agent
would
be
complete
at
that
point,
and
that
would
be
fully
taxable?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
isn't
the
case
here,
but
if
that
were
the
case,
would
that
particular
transaction
as
between
the
company
and
the
agent,
as
distinct
from
the
agent
and
the
traveler,
even
on
your
theory,
be
fully
taxable
without
apportionment?
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
couldn't
they
simply
have
said,
we
allocate
it
50-50,
one
person
is
curled
up
inside
the
telephone
in
illinois,
another
one
is
curled
up
in
new
york,
we
split
it
right
in
half,
and
each
state
could--
justice
david
h.
souter
and
spoke
of
the
problem
of,
the
difficulty
of
attribution.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
difficult...
i
mean,
it
looks
as
though
there's
a
very
simple
way
that
they
might
apportion,
and
so
the
question
is,
do
we
follow...
do
we
say,
well,
if
it
was
tough
in
the
phone
case,
it's
equally
tough
in
this
case,
and
say
there
can't
be
an
apportionment,
or
do
we
say
we
were
wrong
about
apportionment
in
the
first
case,
it's
easy
in
each
instance,
and
therefore
we
see
it
your
way
here?
which
way
do
we
go?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
eight
circuit.
oklahoma
taxes
sales
and
transportation
for
hire
when
the
sale
is
made
within
the
state.
as
with
sales
taxes
generally,
the
buyer
must
pay
the
tax
to
the
seller
who
then
transfer
collected
tax
over
to
the
state.
in
this
case
jefferson
lines,
a
bus
company
refused
to
collect
and
pass
along
sales
taxes
on
bus
travel
from
oklahoma
to
other
states.
although
it
did
collect
and
remit
taxes
to
travel
that
began
and
ended
within
the
state.
in
the
course
of
bankruptcy
proceedings,
the
state
start
to
recover
the
uncollected
taxes,
but
jefferson
objected
arguing
that
by
taxing
ticket
sales
at
4%
regardless
of
whether
the
trip
takes
place
wholly
within
oklahoma,
what
takes
a
passenger
out
of
state,
oklahoma
was
acting
in
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
jefferson
maintained
that
by
taxing
more
than
a
portion
of
the
ticket
price
that
reflected
travel
within
oklahoma
or
itself,
oklahoma
was
taxing
value
derived
from
travel
through
other
states.
jefferson
further
argued
that
the
tax
payer
was
thus
place
at
the
risk
of
multiple
taxation
because
any
other
state
through
which
the
bus
travels
would
be
able
to
impose
its
own
taxes
upon
jefferson
or
its
passengers
for
use
of
the
roads.
jefferson
relied
for
support
on
the
case
of
central
greyhound
lines,
inc.
against
mealey,
decided
by
this
court
in
1948
which
struck
down
the
tax
on
bus
tickets
by
new
york
on
much
of
the
same
grounds;
although
there
the
tax
was
collected
not
indirectly
from
the
purchases
but
directly
from
the
bus
company.
the
bankruptcy
court
agreed
with
jefferson,
the
district
court
affirmed
and
so
did
the
court
of
appeals.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
eight
circuit
and
hold
that
oklahoma’s
tax
does
not
violate
the
commerce
clause.
the
sale
of
the
transportation
services
here
the
payment
for
receipt
of
the
ticket
for
present
commencement
of
the
trip
because
in
one
state
alone,
and
is
akin
to
the
traditional
sales
transaction,
which
at
least
in
the
context
of
the
sale
of
goods,
we
have
long
recognized
as
permitting
a
full
sales
tax
to
the
buyer.
we
therefore
classify
oklahoma’s
tax
with
taxes
of
sales
generally.
in
so
far
as
central
greyhound
points
the
other
way,
we
find
that
it
differs
from
oklahoma’s
sales
tax
and
that
the
new
york
tax
was
placed
directly
on
the
seller
and
it
was
that
feature
which
give
rise
the
possibility
of
multiple
taxation.
here
the
tax
falls
on
the
buyer
of
the
services
who
is
no
more
subject
to
multiple
taxation
than
the
buyer
of
goods
would
be.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
o’connor
joins.
