i
suppose
for
many...
i
mean,
the
basic
thing
that
i
have
a
lot
of
trouble
is,
i
don't
understand
this
word
predominant.
are
you
saying
that
people
can
draw
district
boundaries
in
order
to
put
into
one
district
large
numbers
of
catholics,
jews,
germans,
hispanics,
italians,
all
kinds
of
things,
but
not
blacks,
and
if
there
is
some
distinction
there,
what
is
the
distinction,
particularly
in
light
of
the
history
in
this
country,
and
how
do
you
in
fact
draw
a
line
where
you've
gone
too
far?
i
mean,
those
are
the
problems
that
are
in
my
mind,
and
this
word
predominant
seems
like
a
keystone,
but
what
does
it
mean?
i
can
understand
what
it
might
mean
if
you
have
a
very...
maybe
it's
something
to
do
with
shape.
i
mean,
what
is
your
view
of
the
standard?
are
you
saying
that
under
your
principle
all
of
the
districts
in
the
united
states,
or
many
of
them,
or
most
of
them
are
suddenly
going
to
be
redistricted?
what
sort
of
workable
principles
are
there,
and
what
are
you
aiming
towards?
that's
what
i...
the
questions
in
my
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
would
be
true
in
many,
many,
many
districts
in
the
united
states.
since
the
time
of
1789
people
did
look
to
not
only
racial
but
characteristics
of
nationality,
religion,
class,
occupation,
a
host
of
different
things
in
drawing
districts,
and
i
imagine
that
in
any
case
whether
you
were
an
irish
american,
an
african
american,
or
whatever
the
legislature
thought
might
produce
a
vote
for
their
side,
that
if
we
go
back
and
look
at
those
little
jogs,
and
so
forth,
in
the
boundary,
there
is
a
little
jog
there
or
here
where
that's
what
was
in
the
legislator's
mind.
now
how,
in
fact,
is
a
court
going
to
go
into
this
and
say
when
that
little
jog
is
or
is
not--
justice
stephen
g.

--appropriate
or
not
appropriate?
