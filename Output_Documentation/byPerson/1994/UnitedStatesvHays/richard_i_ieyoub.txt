mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
the
louisiana
congressional
reapportionment
case,
the
first
such
case
to
reach
this
court
on
the
merits
after
shaw
v.
reno.
the
district
court
held
that
louisiana's
fourth
congressional
district
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
also
held
that
all
race
conscious
redistricting,
while
not
always
unconstitutional,
is
always
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
louisiana's
population
is
over
30
percent
black.
since
the
end
of
reconstruction
until
the
1980's
blacks
have
never
comprised
a
majority
in
any
of
louisiana's
congressional
districts.
it
wasn't
until
1983,
compelled
by
federal
court
order,
that
louisiana
drew
its
first
majority
minority
district,
and
not
until
1990
did
louisiana
send
its
first
congressman
to
washington.
in
this
century,
no
black
has
been
elected
to
either
state
wide
office,
or
to
congress,
or
the
state
legislature,
except
from
majority
minority
districts,
and
i
hardly
need
to
remind
this
court--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
i
think
a
majority
minority
district
is
a
district
that
will
give
minorities
a
fair
opportunity
to
elect
representatives
of
their
choice.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
of
any
independent
definition.
it's
simply
that
the
district
contains
a
majority
minority
population.
for
instance,
louisiana's
fourth
congressional
district
has
a
55
percent
majority
minority
population.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor.
and
of
course,
louisiana
has
had,
unfortunately,
a
history
of
past
discriminatory
practices.
act
1,
your
honors,
is
an
effort
on
the
part
of
a
majority
white
legislature
to
afford
minorities
a
fair
opportunity...
i
do
not
say
a
guarantee,
but
a
fair
opportunity
to
have
a
second
minority
voice
in
the
halls
of
congress.
act
1
does
not
guarantee--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
because
of--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
the
history
that
we
have,
the
voting
history
in
the
state
of
louisiana
is
an
indication--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
we
will
accept
the
reality
that
a
black
has
never
been
elected
to
a
legislative
seat
or
to
a
congressional
seat
unless
it
was
from
a
majority
minority
district
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
we
have
to
accept
that
fact
because
that
is
the
history.
as
to
the
fourteenth
amendment--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--no,
your
honor.
we--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--we
try
to
draw
the
districts...
we
try
to
draw
the
districts
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
a
fair
opportunity
to
minorities
to
elect
their
candidates
with
the
hope
that
soon
we
will
not
have
to
consider
race
in
this
situation.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
it
can
eliminate
it.
i
think
that
if
a
state
is
reasonable
and
balanced
in
its
drawing
a
majority
minority
district,
i
think
that
if
we
send
a
message
that
race
does
not
submerge
all
other
facts
in
the
consideration
of
drawing
a
majority
minority--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
we
send
that
message
because
this
is
a
district
that
only
gives
a
fair
opportunity.
it
doesn't
pack
minorities
into
a
particular
district.
it's
55
percent
black
population,
which
we
have
evidence
to
establish
is
almost
necessary
to
give
a
fair
opportunity.
if
you
look
at
the
congressional
districts
that
border
district
4,
you
will
find
that
those
districts
have
between
an
18
to
27
percent
black
population,
which
is
more
black
population
than
75
percent
of
all
the
other
districts
nation
wide,
so
that's
some
indication
that
we're
not
trying
to
send
out
a
message
that
we're
trying
to
segregate
or
separate.
rather,
we're
trying
to
include.
we're
trying
to
give
a
fair
opportunity
here.
if
you
look
at
5
of
the
12
parishes
that
were
split
in
drawing
district
4,
you
will
find
that
the
portion
of
the
parishes
that
were
brought
into
district
4
actually
had
a
greater
white
population
than
a
black
population.
for
instance,
evangeline
parish.
that
section
of
evangeline
parish
that
came
into
district
4
had
a
62
percent
white
population
and
only
a
37
percent
black
population.
what
we
are--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
for
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
condemning
act
4
as
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
is
fundamentally
wrong
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
district
court
misread
shaw
v.
reno
and
applied
strict
scrutiny
in
condemning
district
4,
which
is
not
bizarre
on
its
face
if
you
measure
it
by
objective
standards
of
past
redistricting
principles.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
the
most
compact.
it
follows
very
closely
the
old
eighth
congressional
district,
which
was
a
majority
white
district.
it
follows
it
extremely
closely.
i
invite
your
honors
to
look
at
the
color
depictions
of
the
maps
of
the
old
eighth
congressional
district
which
we
have
supplied
the
court.
there
you
will
see
25
years
of
redistricting
history
upon
which
the
configuration
of
the
old...
of
the
fourth
congressional
district
is
built.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
your
honor,
there
was
evidence
that
was...
that
it
was
drawn
in
such
a
way
as
to
assist
congressman
gillis
long
into
being
elected,
but
obviously
it
was
never
challenged
in
any
court.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
has
struck
down,
but
political
considerations
can
be
taken
into
consideration
when
drawing...
when
redistricting.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that
is
my
mistake,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
has
ever
struck
down
a
political
gerrymander
to
protect
incumbency.
incumbency,
in
fact,
can
be
considered
in
redistricting.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no,
your
honor.
the
criteria
that
i
urge
upon
the
court
is
to
use
past
redistricting
history,
past
redistricting
principles,
ensuring
that
the
district
that
is
drawn
is
not
significantly
stranger
in
shape
than
any
other
district.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
there's
no
question,
your
honor,
that
the
legislature
considered
race
in
trying
to
form
a
majority
minority
district.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
to
some
extent,
your
honor,
but
not
so
dramatically
that
one
could
say
it
was
a
dramatic
departure
from
past
redistricting
principles,
and
certainly
district
4
does
not
look
that
much
stranger
than
the
old
district
8,
which
was
a
majority
white
district.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
your
honor,
in
some
cases
district
4
is
actually
more
compact
than
the
old
district
8.
district
8
extended
from
the
texas
border
all
the
way
to
lake
ponchartrain.
that
is
not
the
case
in
district
4.
it
follows
the
same
red
river
parishes
down
the
red
river
and
mississippi
axis
through
central
louisiana
and
ends
around
baton
rouge.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor,
it
does
represent
quite
a
change
from
act
42.
this
we
submit,
your
honor,
is
a
compact
district
that
does
not
depart
dramatically
from
past
historical
configurations.
in
fact,
it
follows
the
old
eighth
district
quite
a
bit.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
your
honor,
i
think
that
initially
one
can
look
at
the
particular
configuration
of
the
district
and
make
a
determination,
at
least
looking
at
it,
whether
or
not
the
configuration
is
bizarre.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
what
needs
to
be
done
is
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
district
does
follow
historical
redistricting
configurations.
if
it's
not
stranger
than
other
districts
that
have
been
drawn
using
other
factors,
if
that
is
the
case,
then
certainly
it
is
not
bizarre
under
shaw
v.
reno,
and
strict
scrutiny
should
not
apply.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
your
honor,
if
it's
bizarre...
if
you
say
that
it
is
bizarre,
and
strict
scrutiny
applies,
then
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
compelling
state
interest,
and
then
whether
or
not
it's
narrowly
tailored,
or
the
plan
is
narrowly
tailored
to
satisfy
that
compelling
state
interest.
if
you
apply
strict
scrutiny,
then
i
think
that
the
court
has
to
prove,
or
show
the
compelling
state
interest,
and
it
can
be
done
that,
even
if
the
court...
it
can
be
done
even
if
the
court
finds
that
it
is
bizarre.
