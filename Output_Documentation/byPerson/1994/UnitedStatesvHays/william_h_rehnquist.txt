general
ieyoub.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean,
general
ieyoub,
about,
what
is
a
majority
minority
district?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
it's
almost
self
defining,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
if
you
say
nobody
has
been
elected
except
from
a
district
which
will
give
minorities
a
chance
to
elect
a
minority,
is
there
any
independent
definition
of
a
majority
minority
district?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
that
perhaps
is
the
definition,
that
the
district
has
a
majority
of
a
minority
population.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wasn't
the
old
eighth
district
deliberately
gerrymandered
just
to
keep
representative
long
in
office?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
ieyoub.
general
days,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
it's
a
purely
visual
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
only
looking
at
the
shape
of
the
district.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
perhaps
is
the
same
thing
i
think--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--justice
o'connor
was
trying
to
get
at.
supposing
that
the
shape
itself
does
not
prove
to
be
really
"bizarre"
but
a
finding
of
fact
is
made
that
the
predominant
purpose
of
the
legislature
was
to
construct
a
majority
minority
district.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
bizarreness
by...
is
not
an
essential
ingredient
of
a
claim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ujo
was
a
badly
splintered
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
days.
mr.
warren,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
warren,
certainly
it
is
not
a
cosmetic
makeover
in
the
sense
that
is...
it
follows
closely
the
lines
of
the
earlier
district.
it's
quite
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
mean,
geographically
it's
quite
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
sure
does.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing...
supposing,
mr.
warren,
that
the
evidence
before
the...
shows
that
the
louisiana
legislature
simply
paired
off
this
district
because
they
wanted
about
a
70
percent
democratic
majority
in
it.
can
you
come
into
court
and
say
well,
the
statistics
from
past
voting
in
louisiana
show
that
90
percent
of
blacks
vote
democratic,
therefore,
although
ostensibly
it
was
democratic
it
was
really
racially
motivated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you...
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
warren.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
94-558
and
a
related
case
united
states
versus
hays
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
