justice

scalia
the
assumption
being
that
unless
a
minority
is
in
a
majority,
they
don't
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
get
one
of
their
members
elected
in
louisiana,
an
acceptance
of,
essentially,
racial
voting.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
acknowledge
that
in
louisiana
you
don't
have
a
chance
of
being
elected
unless
you're
elected
by
a
majority
of
your
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
accept
that.
you
accept
that
as
the
reality
and
want
to
draw
district
lines
on
the
acceptance
of
that
reality,
that
people
vote
by
race,
and
that
we
must
district
by
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
this
will
help
society
to
get
away
from
considering
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
intentionally
drawing
the
districts
according
to
race,
and
having
people
run
on
the
basis
of
race,
presumably,
in
these
racial
districts,
you
think
we're
going
to
eliminate
this
terrible
state
of
affairs
in
louisiana,
that
people
vote
by
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
going
to
eliminate
it
rather
than
entrench
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
are
you
sending
that
message
when
you
draw
a
district
on
the
basis
of
race,
and
when
you
come
up
and
acknowledge
that
you
don't
have
a
fair
chance
of
getting
elected
in
louisiana
unless
people
of
your
race
vote
for
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
going
to
be
our
criterion.
any...
have
we
ever
stricken
down
a
gerrymander
that
was
done
for
political
purposes?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
going
to
be
our
criterion
as
to
whether
this
district
is
too
weird.
if
it
were
done
for
political
purposes,
and
there's
nothing
too
weird
for
political
purposes--
[laughter]
--it
can
be
done
for
racial
purposes.
is
that
the
criterion
you
urge
upon
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
didn't
stick
to
the
old
district.
you
intentionally
altered
the
old
district,
as
unusual
as
it
is.
you
made
it
a
little
more
unusual,
or
unusual
in
a
different
way,
in
order
to
ensure
that
you
had
a
certain
majority
of
people
of
a
certain
race,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is,
indeed,
how
the
district
was
formed.
you
didn't
just
take
this
old
gerrymandered
district
and
leave
it
there.
you
changed
it
to
be
sure
you
could
get
a
certain
number
of
people
of
a
certain
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
general,
i
don't
think
the
question
has
been
whether
they
use
it
at
all.
i
thought
the
question
has
been
whether
that
has
been
the
predominant
consideration.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
whether
that's
the
basis
on
which
the
district
was
drawn,
and
i
thought
that
that
had
been
conceded
here,
that
these
are
not
hypothetical
questions
you're
getting.
i
thought
that
that
is
the
case
here,
that
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
acknowledges
that
that's
how
the
district
was
drawn,
with
the
precise
purpose
of
getting
a
majority
minority
district.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
a
distinction
can
be
made
between
situations
where
race
is
one
of
a
lot
of
factors
that's
considered
in
districting
and
situations
in
which
race
is
the
determinative
factor,
where
you
set
out
to
create
a
majority
minority
district?
can't
that
distinction
be
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you're
included
in
because
you're
black,
i
presume
you're
excluded
out
because
you're
white.
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly
a
person
who's
contiguous
enough
that
he
might
have
been
included
in
but
for
the
fact
that
they
wanted
to
exclude
any
more
white
votes,
i
assume
he'd
have
some
complaint,
but
he
might
have
to
show
that,
i
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
have
to
do
that.
you
would
satisfy
me
if
you
could
show
some
evidence
that
but
for
racial
districting
one
of
your
plaintiffs
would
have
been
in
a
different
district.
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
a
concrete
harm.
a
person
would
have
been
in
one
district.
he
is
put
in
another
district
solely
by
reason
of
racial
districting,
even
though
the
racial
districting
might
not
have
had
anything
to
do
with
his
race,
but
you
haven't
even
demonstrated
that,
as
far
as
i
can
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
for
this
racial
districting
any
one
of
your
plaintiffs
would
have
been
in
a
different
district?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
had
to
be
redrawn.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
had
to
be
redrawn
because
the
prior
system
was
unconstitutional.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
make
some
showing
that
the
redrawing
would
have
included
them
in
a
different
district
but
for
this
racial
factor.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
know
that
you've
made
any
such
showing.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
do
say
that
anybody
in
the
state
has
a
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
warren,
i
assume
when--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
regular
districts
and
it's
one
of
the
elements
of
regular
districts,
ordinarily
race
is
not
the
predominant
factor.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
factors
you're
taking
into
account.
geographic
proximity,
same
schools,
community
of
geographic
interests,
and
so
forth.
that's
what
makes
regular
districts
ordinarily
less
challengeable,
but
if
you
find
one
where
the
only
reason
they
picked
this
particular
regular
district
is
race,
then
you
have
a
different
situation,
but
an
unusual
one,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
only
assert
it's
bad
if
race
is
the
predominant
consideration.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
acknowledge
that
race
can
be
one
of
the
considerations
in
a
whole
bunch?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
not
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if,
and
this
raises
both
kiryas
joel
and
the
ujo
case,
what
if
a
racial,
ethnic,
or
religious
group
has
certain
social
characteristics
that
render
it
cohesive?
i
always
viewed
ujo
as
not
lumping
these
people
together
because
they
were
hasidic
jews
but
because
they
had
a
lifestyle
that
rendered
them
a
natural
political
community.
you
would
have
no
objection
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
a
city
which
has
an
area
that
is
a
social
unit,
all
of
which
is
black,
and
perhaps
the
blackness
has
something
to
do
with
the
social
unit
of
it,
that
being
lumped
together,
would
you?
