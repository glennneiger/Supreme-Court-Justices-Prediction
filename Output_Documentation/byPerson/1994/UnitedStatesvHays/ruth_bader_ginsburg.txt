justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general,
may
i
just
be
clear
on
one
fact?
we
now
know
what
a
majority
minority
district
is,
and
you
said
the
population,
the
black
population
was
30
percent
of
the
state.
before
1983,
was
there
any
majority
minority
district?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
no
black
had
ever
been
elected,
ever?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
original
one
did.
you
reacted...
louisiana
reacted
to
shaw
v.
reno.
what
was
the
difference
between
the
district
that's
here
before
us
and
the
original
one
that
you
had?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
represents
quite
a
change
from,
what
was
it
called,
act
42?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
general
days,
isn't
it
the
case
here
that
it's
conceded
the
endeavor
was
to
create
a
majority
minority
district,
and
i
think
you
answered
justice
o'connor's
question
by
distinguishing
reno
v.
shaw
from
simply
endeavoring
to
create
a
minority
majority
district.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
cited
precedent.
i
thought
you
had
in
mind
united
jewish
organizations
v.
carey,
and
wasn't
the
predominant
purpose
there
to
create
a
minority
majority
district?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
warren,
they're
all
of
different
races.
aren't
these
plaintiffs
of
different
races?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
little
hard
to...
i
could
see
if
you
had
white
plaintiffs
who
said
we
were
put
out
of
this
district
because
we
were
white,
but
you
have
a
black
plaintiff
and
a
white
plaintiff
and
an
asian
american
plaintiff,
so
every
race
is
equally
discriminated
against,
treated
the
same.
i
don't
see
how
you
get
racial
discrimination
by
an
exclusion
that
equally
affects
a
black
and
a
white.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
these
people
are
left
out
without
regard
to
their
race,
or
put
in
another
district.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
really
are
arguing
a
kind
of
standing
that
i
up
until
now
thought
existed
only
in
the
establishment
clause
area.
is
anybody...
anybody
in
the
state
can
object
to
this
kind
of
districting?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
weren't
put
out
because
of
their
race,
since
they
were--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--all
different
race.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
warren,
you
did
start
out
with
plaintiffs
who
were
voters
in
the
district
that
you
challenged.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
the
state
too
it
back
and
said,
we
realize
this
plan
has
infirmities.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
coming
up
with
a
new...
and
that
left
your
people
out.
there's
no
way
to
connect
them
back
to
the
plan
that
is
moot.
it's
academic.
compare
them
to
where
they
were
before
there
was
any
42.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
warren,
what
do
you
do
with--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was
a
badly
splintered
opinion,
but
there
were
two,
if
you
will,
stereotypes
involved
in
the
ujo
case,
and
both
of
them,
both
groups
accepted
the
proposition
that
if
we
can
have
our
district
not
every
hasidic
jew
is
going
to
vote
the
same
way
but
a
lot
of
them
are,
and
the
same
assumption
was
made...
what
is
the
difference
between
louisiana
and
new
york,
or
do
we
just
say,
ujo
is
a
hopeless
precedent,
forget
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
warren,
i'd
like
to
be
clear
on
whether
you
make
a
distinction
between
race
and
other
suspect
categories.
would
you
make
any
different
argument
if
we
were
talking
about
polish
americans,
about
italian
americans,
about
irish
americans?
suppose
the
dominant
or
a
substantial
purpose
was
to
have
a
district
where
the
dominant
national
origin
group
would
be
irish.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
warren,
when
you
speak
about
difficult
decisions,
one
of
the
many
problems
in
this
case
is
when
you
deal
with
shaw
v.
reno,
when
you've
got
one
criterion,
bizarreness,
and
that's
not
hard
to
apply,
but
to
determine
predominant,
substantial,
and
it
can
spread
to
other
groups,
national
origin
groups
that
have
been
classified
as
suspect,
it
seems
you're
getting...
you're
opening
the
door
to
the
kinds
of
challenges
that
the
federal
courts
were
into
of
necessity
in
the
school
segregation
cases
and
to
a
limited
extent
in
the
redistricting
cases.
it
just...
well,
how
can
you
contain
this
thing
once
you
open
the
door
in
this
way?
