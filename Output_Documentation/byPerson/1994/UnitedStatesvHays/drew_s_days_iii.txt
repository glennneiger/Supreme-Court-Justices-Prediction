mr.

s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
my
argument
by
trying
to
address
the
question
that
justice
souter
was
putting
to
general
ieyoub
about
the
relationship
between
bizarreness
and
the
nature
of
the
inquiry.
first
of
all,
i
agree
with
justice...
general
ieyoub
that
the
court
here
used
the
wrong
legal
standard
in
determining
whether
the
district
was
bizarre
sufficient
to
trigger
strict
scrutiny
under
this
court's
decisions
in
shaw.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
it,
as
this
court
had
addressed
it
in
shaw
v.
reno,
there
would
have
to
be
a
showing
of
the
bizarreness
of
the
district,
otherwise
what
would
happen
is
courts
could
justify--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--justice
o'connor,
we
don't
read
shaw
v.
reno
to
authorize
that
type
of
inquiry.
what
we
see
shaw
v.
reno,
with
respect,
as
doing
is
imposing
some
limiting
principles
on
preexisting
precedent.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
i
don't
think
it's
a
purely
visual
test.
i
think,
as
general
ieyoub
indicated,
there
has
to
be
some
inquiry
on
the
part
of
the
court
with
respect
to
what
has
been
done
in
the
past.
it's
an
objective
and
comparative
analysis,
not
simply
eyeballing.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
only
looking
at
the
shape
of
a
district
i
think
does
not
provide
the
type
of
information
that
we
believe
this
court
was
seeking.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
under
those
circumstances
i
think
the
case
would
move
into
strict
scrutiny
and
the
state
would
have
to
show
a
compelling
interest
for
doing
what
it
was
doing.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
it
is,
because
prior
to
shaw
v.
reno,
and
as
i
indicated
i
don't
think
shaw
v.
reno
changed
the
law,
it
was
not
possible
to
set
out
an
equal
protection
claim
unless
one
could
show
that
there
was
some
injury.
that
is,
intent
to
discriminate
and
a
discriminatory
effect,
and
it
is
not
our
reading
of
shaw
v.
reno
that
it
changed
that
law.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
with
respect,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
that's
what
shaw
v.
reno
says.
it
says
that
the
district
is
drawn
in
a
way
that
can
be
reasonably
understood
as
being
solely
for
the
purpose
of
separating
the
races.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
correct,
that
shaw
v.
reno--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--because
i
think
this
court's
prior
precedent
dictates
that.
let
me
give
an
example
of
how
the
court's
standard
here--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--the
explanation
would
be
that
shaw
v.
reno
did
not
create
a
new
cause
of
action
that
rejected
prior
causes
of
action.
we
understand
shaw
v.
reno
to
say
that
if
it
is
shown
that
the
district
is
so
bizarre
that
it
can
be
understood
in
only
a
racial
gerrymandering
fashion,
then
the
state
is
responsible
for
justifying
that
under
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
because
this
court
did
not
change
the
prior
law,
and
what
the
prior
law
said,
what
this
court
recognized,
was
that
race
is
something
that
is
always
a
part
of
the
redistricting
process.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
neutral
redistricting
line,
so--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
what
this
court
recognized
in
shaw
v.
reno
and
other
cases,
as
i
was
about
to
describe,
was
that
race
is
a
consideration
along
with
other
criteria
in
the
redistricting
process,
so
if
what
you're
saying,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
whenever
a
state
uses
race
as
one
of
the
considerations
in
the
redistricting
process,
it's
automatically
moved
over
into
strict
scrutiny.
then
the
consequences
are
as
follows.
if
louisiana,
for
example,
drew
a
district
that
recognized
the
interest
of
creoles,
decided
that
creoles
had
a
different
language,
had
a
different
religious
view,
had
different
political
views
and
different
economic
concerns,
that
would
not
trigger
any
constitutional
review.
but
if
the
state
looked
at
a
group
of
blacks
and
decided
that
those
blacks
had
commonalities
of
interest
that
coincided
with
race
but
did
not
turn
solely
on
race
and
tried
to
recognize
those
communities
of
interest,
the
reading
that's
being
suggested
would
automatically
shift
that
determination
by
the
state
into
strict
scrutiny,
and
it
is
our
position
that
for
this
court
to
suggest
that
every
time
a
state
or
a
locality
or
a
municipality
goes
through
a
redistricting
process
and
uses
race
as
one
of
the
considerations
that
it
moves
into
strict
scrutiny
has
several
problems.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
understand
that,
justice.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
but
justice
scalia,
we
can
talk
about
whether
the
state
satisfied
strict
scrutiny,
but
the
point
i
think
that
is
very
important
to
make
in
terms
of
the
process
is,
it's
not
merely
a
matter
of
shifting
burdens,
it
is
that
even
with
a
completely
regular
traditional
district
with
no
deviations
whatsoever,
the
standard
that
the
district
court
used,
namely,
where
race
conscious
redistricting
is
involved
it
is
not
necessarily
unconstitutional
but
always
subject
to
strict
scrutiny,
is
a
very
powerful
and
i
think
very
disruptive
and
incorrect
way
of
looking
at
the
districting
process.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
distinction
can
be
made,
but
i
think
the
process
is
important.
if
a
state
uses
an
approach
that
happens
to
coincide
with
concentrations
of
racial
minorities,
i
think
the
test
that's
being
presented
here
would
automatically
haul
before
the
court
the
legislative
officers
who
were
involved
in
this
process
to
probe
their
intent,
to
find
out
what
they
were
thinking,
what
all
of
them
had
in
mind
when
they
passed
the
statute.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
absolutely,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that's
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that
we
did
not
understand
shaw
v.
reno
to
repudiate
prior
precedent,
and
in
ujo,
five
justices
of
this
court
very
clearly
said--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--it
was
badly
splintered,
but
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
one
can
find
in
that
opinion
a
recognition
that
in
the
limited
circumstance
where
the
state
was
trying
to
respond
to
a
denial
of
preclearance
by
the
united
states
attorney
general
under
the
voting
rights
act,
that
what
new
york
did
there
was
consistent
with
the
constitution.
there
are
other
positions
there
that
we're
not...
we
recognize
were
not
shared
by
a
majority--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
let
me
take
the
second
part
of
that.
i
think
the
court
has
indicated
it's
always
available
for
plaintiff
to
bring
a
packing
claim.
that's
independent
of
this
process,
and
it
would
be
like
a
traditional
lawsuit
showing
dilution,
which
was
not
a
right
that
was
abrogated
or
altered
in
any
way
insofar
as
we're
concerned
by
shaw
v.
reno,
so
that
claim
would
still
be
available.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
absolutely
correct.
now,
on
the
question
of
whether
a
district
is
found
bizarre
by
the
court,
then
what
happens
at
the
point
of
meeting
strict
scrutiny
and
showing
a
compelling
interest
are
narrow
tailoring.
i
think
that
if
bizarreness
were
found,
it
might
be
impossible
to
satisfy
the
claim
that
it
was
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
for
thinking
that
a
section
2
violation
might
occur.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
there
would
be
a
possibility
under
section
5,
and
there
would
also
be
a
possibility
of
justifying
it
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
because
the
compelling
interest
that
the
state
has
put
forward
here--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
correct,
and
therefore
there
is
obviously
a
connection
between
a
bizarreness
finding
and
a
section
2
defense,
but
not
between
bizarreness
and
some
of
the
other
claims
that
are
made.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
that's
not
the
position.
it's
a
more
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis,
and
it's
not
an
automatic
determination
as
to
how
that
would
be
resolved.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
believe
it
was
a
contiguous
district,
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
justice
o'connor,
as
you
are
aware,
we
did
not
raise
the
standing
issue,
but
i
think
that
it
is
a
problematic
concern
in
this
case.
if
shaw
v.
reno
in
fact
entitled
people
because
of
certain
stigmatic
harm
or
the
possibility
that
they
would
not
be
adequately
represented
to
bring
a
shaw
v.
reno
claim,
those
who
are
either
in
the
district
or
in
adjoining
districts
who
might
be
affected
by
the
district
i
think
probably
have
the
type
of
standing
that
the
court
had
in
mind
in
shaw
v.
reno.
the
problem
is
how
far
to
take
that,
and
whether
it
can
go
to
the
extent
of
the
entire
state,
anyone,
any
place
in
the
state
can
bring
this
type
of
lawsuit
with
respect
to
one
district.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
the
only
thing
i'm
trying
to
point
out
is
that
prior
to
the
shaw
v.
reno...
may
i
complete
my
answer--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--mr.
chief
justice?
prior
to
shaw
v.
reno
standing
was
consistent
with
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
like
the
wright
case,
where
there
had
to
be
something
shown.
injury,
in
fact,
traceability
and
redressability.
under
shaw
v.
reno
there
appears
to
be
some
variation
in
those
standards.
thank
you
very
much.
