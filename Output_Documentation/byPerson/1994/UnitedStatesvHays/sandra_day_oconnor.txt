justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
was...
is
district
4
the
most
compact
majority
minority
district
that
could
be
drawn
outside
new
orleans?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
case
did
that?
that's
a
new
one
to
me.
i
didn't
know
that
we
had
a
case
that
struck
down
political
gerrymandering
on
the
basis
of
protecting
incumbents.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
general
days,
let's
suppose
that
the
evidence
discloses...
and
remove
it
from
this
case
for
a
moment.
let's
just
suppose
the
evidence
discloses
clearly
that
the
predominant
purpose
of
drawing
the
particular
district
boundaries
was
to
achieve
a
certain
racial
goal.
that
was
the
predominant
purpose,
regardless
of
appearance.
is
there
a
claim
made?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
the
extreme
appearance
of
a
district
boundaries
might
be
strong
evidence
of
just
that,
that
the
predominant
or
sole
purpose
was
to
draw
it
along
racial
lines.
now,
if
that's
established
by
other
means,
is
the
court
not
to
look
at
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
days,
speaking
of
section
5,
in
preclearing
does
the
department
of
justice
assume
that
unless
the
legislature
of
the
state
creates
a
majority
minority
district
where
it
is
possible
to
do
it,
that
otherwise
there...
you
would
assume
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
we'll
get
into
that
more
in
the
next
case,
but
let
me
ask
you
one
other
thing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
did
not
live
in
district
4,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
did
not...
they
lived
in
some
district,
was
it
contiguous
to
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
assume
that
they
have
standing
to
raise
this
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
parks,
where
do
the
plaintiffs
reside,
in
what
district?
he's
mr.
warren.
excuse
me,
mr.
warren.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
do
the
plaintiffs
reside?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
were
in
the
1992--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--district.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
they
contend--
--are
they
contiguous
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
they
in
a
district
that
is
contiguous
now
to
4?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
they
haven't
personally
been
denied
equal
protection
treatment,
have
them?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
some
kind
of
generalized
grievance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
consolidated
cases
come
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
western
district
of
louisiana.
they
concern
a
challenge
to
louisiana's
congressional
districting
plan
called
act
1.
act
1
contains
two
so-called
majority-minority
voting
districts.
one
of
them
district
2
is
located
in
the
new
orleans
area.
the
other
district
4
begins
in
the
northwest
part
of
the
state
and
runs
southeast
along
the
red
river
to
baton
rouge.
appellees
who
do
not
reside
in
either
majority-minority
district
claim
that
act
1
is
a
racial
gerrymander
that
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
focusing
particularly
on
district
4
agreed
that
act
1
constitutes
a
racial
gerrymander
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
under
the
principles
this
court
announced
two
terms
ago
in
shaw
versus
reno.
it
also
held
that
act
1
is
not
narrowly
tailored
to
furthering
a
compelling
governmental
interest
unless
that
it
is
unconstitutional.
louisiana
and
the
united
states
as
a
defendant-intervener
appealed
directly
to
this
court.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
do
not
reach
the
merits
of
appellees
challenge
to
act
1,
because
we
conclude
that
appellees
lack
standing
to
bring
it.
it
is
well-settled
and
an
order
to
bring
suite
in
federal
court,
a
plaintiff
may
not
assert
a
generalize
grievance
against
allegedly
illegal
governmental
conduct,
but
instead
must
have
personally
suffered
what
our
case
is
called
“injury
in
fact”.
we
have
held
that
racial
classifications
of
any
sort
cause
individualized
injury.
we
have
recognized
in
shaw
that
in
the
voting
context
such
classifications
can
cause
special
representational
harms,
but
appellees
do
not
live
in
the
allegedly,
racially
gerrymander
district
where
they
might
suffer
these
representational
harms
nor
have
they
shown
that
they
personally
have
been
classified
according
to
their
race.
appellees
therefore,
have
failed
to
demonstrate
louisiana’s
redistricting
plan
injured
them,
and
as
they
have
not
carried
their
burden
of
showing
they
have
standing
to
sue.
we
vacate
the
district
court’s
judgment
and
remand
the
case
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
statement
in
which
justice
souter
joins;
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
ginsburg
concurs
in
the
judgment.
