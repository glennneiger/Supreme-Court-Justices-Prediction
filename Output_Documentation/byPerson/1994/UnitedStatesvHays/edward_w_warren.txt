mr.
edward
w.
warren
chief
justice
rehnquist,
may
it
please
the
court:
before
discussing
this
morning
how
this
case
fits
within
the
court's
traditional
equal
protection
framework,
i
think
it's
probably
important
to
set
the
record
straight.
first
is
the
district
court
held
act
1,
which
is
challenged
here,
is
a
cosmetic
makeover
of
act
42,
which
the
state
of
louisiana
concedes
was
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
specifically,
district
4
in
act
1
joins
together
four
widely
separated
cities.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that's
a
misperception
in
this
sense.
there
are
four
major
metropolitan
areas.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
it
looks
different.
if
you're
simply--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--talking
about
visual
appearances,
it
looks
different,
but
let
me
stress
that
the
key
to
this
district
4
is
four
metropolitan
areas
which
heretofore
in
louisiana
history
had
always
been
in
three
or
four
separate
congressional
districts.
the
key
to
creating
this
district
was
joining
them
together
in
one
district,
combining
them
in
one
district.
now,
when
they
were
combined
in
one
district,
in
order
to
accomplish
that,
you
end
up
having
to
split
parishes,
and
this
district
splits
12
of
its
15
parishes.
no
previous
district
in
the
history
of
louisiana
ever
split
more
than
four
parishes.
indeed,
no
entire
plan
in
the
history
of
louisiana
ever
split
more
than
seven.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
justice--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--justice
o'connor,
they
reside
in
grambling
and
ruston,
louisiana.
those
two
communities
were
in
the
previous
district
4,
the
zorro
district
that
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
referring
to.
when
the
lines
were
redrawn,
they
were
therefore
separated
out
from
the
new
district
4.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes,
they
are.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes.
they
were
in
district
5,
and
it
is
contiguous
to
district
4.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
no,
chief...
i
mean,
no
justice
kennedy.
their
position
was
and
is
that
they
have
a
right
not
to
be
classified
by
race
for
purposes
of
districting.
their
claim
is
really
closely
analogous
to
the
kind
of
claim
that
is
made
with
respect
to
jury
selection.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
they've
been
mistreated,
and
this
is
what
i
was
trying
to
address,
justice
kennedy,
they
have
been
mistreated
by
the
state
of
louisiana
by
being
classified
by
race
for
purposes
of
districting.
it
was
their
race,
and
it
was
the
race
of
louisiana
citizens,
which
determined
the
lines
which
were
drawn,
and
i
think
we've
proved
that.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
justice
ginsburg,
our
claim
is
that
our
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
be
treated
without
regard
to
race.
it
is
true--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--no,
but
citizens
in
the
state
are
being
classified
by...
on
racial
grounds
in
order
to
draw
these
district
lines,
as
the
district
court
so
found
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
we
are
making
a
claim
which
is
closely
analogous
to
the
standing
found
in
the
jury
selection
cases.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
but
still
and
all,
it
is
based
upon
the
right
of
every
citizen
not
to
be
put
on
a
particular
petit
jury
based
on
his
or
her
race.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
first
let
me
say
that
it...
the
jury
pool
from
which
juries
are
selected
is
very
much
like
the
electorate
from
which
districts
are
being
drawn,
but
let
me
go
further
to
say
our
plaintiffs
were,
as
i
responded
to
justice
o'connor,
in
district
4
of
act
42,
which
was
then
invalidated.
now
they
are...
they...
whether
black
or
white,
they
are
outside
of
the
new
district
4,
that
is
true,
but
we--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--well--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--they
weren't
individually,
perhaps,
but
the
district
lines
were
drawn
based
upon
race
so
that
individuals
who
were
black
or
white
or
lived
in
those
communities
where
the
lines
were
being
drawn
on
race
were
being
classified
by
race.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
i
think
that
they
have--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--a
personal
right
not
to
be
classified
by
race.
we
analogize
it
in
our
brief
to
brown.
i
mean,
the
question
in
brown
was
not
whether
or
not
there
was
a
different
education.
it
was
stipulated,
albeit
probably
not
truly,
the
fact
that
the
education
was
equal.
the
question
was
being
classified
by
race
for
purposes
of
education.
this
is
classification
by
the
state
for...
by
race
for
purposes
of
voting.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
first
of
all,
i
think
we
are
arguing
that
persons
who
are
in
districts
adjacent
to
this
district
are
being
affected,
because
the
district...
let
me
say,
i
don't
want
to
engage
in
the
very
racial
stereotypes
which
are
the
problem
of
this
case
in
order
to
defend
standing.
i
don't
want
to
say
that
my
black
plaintiff
is
being
harmed
because
he's
being
put
in
a
vastly
white
majority
district.
that
is
feeding
the
very
stereotype
which
is
the
vice
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
i
think
again,
unless
i
engage...
it's
easy
enough
for
me
to
make
the
allegation
that
my
plaintiff
ed
adams,
who
is
black,
is
being
harmed
by
being
put
in
a
district
that
is
85
percent
white.
i
could
do
that.
sure
i
could
make
that
allegation,
but
if
i
made
that
allegation,
i
would
be
predicating
that
allegation
on
the
very
vice
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
racial
stereotyping.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
i
think
we
have
demonstrated
that,
because...
because--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--well,
but
for
this
entire
process
they
would
have
been
in
district
4
and
act
42.
they
were
taken
out
of
that
when
the
lines
were
redrawn,
but
because
those
lines
were
redrawn
on
a
racial
basis
they
were
put
out
of
a
previous
district.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
of
course
they
had
to
be
redrawn.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
i--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--well,
i
think
i've
made
the
following
showings.
let
me
try
to
summarize,
because
i
don't
want
to...
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--indeed.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
right.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
but
your
honor,
you're
missing
one
major
point
that
i
keep
trying
to
stress.
we
challenged
act
1.
we
did
not
challenge
district
4.
we
challenged
the
entire
state
law
which
districted
by
race
state
wide.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
i
do
say
anybody
in
the
state
has
a
claim.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
i'm
not
trying
to
duck
that
at
all.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
i
apologize.
i
didn't
mean
to
avoid
that,
because
we
do
say
that.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes,
justice--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
first,
that's
not
our
case,
but--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--well,
i
mean,
i
think
it's
not
our
case
because
i
think
these
lines
don't
meet
any
of
the
criteria
you're
talking
about,
but
let
me
continue
and
not
argue--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--oh,
in
your
hypothetical,
if
we
assume--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--we're
assuming
away
shape.
we're
assuming
away
traditional
districting
principles.
that
is,
we
don't
have
the
split
parishes
and
split
cities
and
all
the
things
that
i
was
referring
to
previously.
if
we
have
only
the
concession
that
race
was
the
predominant
factor,
it
is
still
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
it
is
unconstitutional
unless
the
state
can
come
forward
with
a
compelling
interest.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
they
have
no--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--the
history
won't
do
it.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
that
would
be
equally
questionable.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
i
don't
think
we
would...
in
a
real
world
i
don't
think
we
get
stymied
in
the
way
in
which
you're
talking.
race
cannot
be
the
predominant
factor
under
this
court's
equal
protection
analysis.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
but
i
think
an
extremely
unusual
one.
i
mean,
this
is
a
hypothetical
that
is
really
impossible
to
be
true
in
reality,
because
i
think--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--yes.
i
think
this
is--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--sure.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
sure.
race...
i
agree
with
what--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--this
court
has
had
for
20
years
a
framework
for
evaluating
these
cases,
these
questions
of
mixed
motive.
that
framework
applies
here
just
as
it
does
in
a
whole
variety
of
different
settings.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
it
requires
a
careful
examination
of
facts,
and
those
facts
can
include
consideration
of
the
real
purpose
of
the
legislature.
let
me
say,
though,
it's
a
lot
easier
than
that
is
suggested,
because
what
you
could
look
at,
and
shaw
was
an
example
of
one
type
of
evidence,
the
bizarre
shape
of
the
district.
another
is
exactly
what
i
was
trying
to
start
with,
which
was...
which
is,
did
you
follow
traditional
district
principles?
did
you
follow
louisiana's
own
history?
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
i
understand
exactly,
and
justice
breyer,
the
starting
point
is
this
court's
traditional
analysis
under
vandermeer...
i
mean,
under
washington
v.
davis
and
arlington
heights.
now,
the
question
is
always
going
to
be
factual.
the
question
that
you're
asking,
though,
is
always
was
the
factor
which
drove
this
district
a
suspect
classification?
was
it
race,
in
this
case.
if
the
answer
to
that
was
yes--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--first...
first
of
all--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--first
of
all,
justice
breyer,
this
court
said
in
shaw,
and
i
think
justice
o'connor's
opinion
on
this
draws
about
the
right
line,
and
that
is
that
race
can
help
us
to
define
the
boundaries
of
a
community.
i
mean,
it's
not
irrelevant.
it
is
one
of
these
things
that
is
going
to
be
before
the
legislature,
and
we
know
it
is
going
to
be
before
the
legislature.
the
problem
is
when
race
takes
over
and
the
district
is
being
drawn
based
upon
racial
stereotypes,
and
if
i
could
quote
from
what
our
opponents
said
in
their
brief,
because
they
make
this
point,
they
say
that
blacks
and
presumably
whites
also
vote
differently
and,
as
they
say,
are
different
politically
cohesive
groups,
and
they
argue
that
without
race
dominant
districting,
those
groups
are
going
to
be
put
at
a
competitive
disadvantage,
but
what
that
is
doing,
it
is
making
assumptions
that
all
blacks
are
going
to
vote
the
same
way,
all
whites
are
going
to
vote
the
same
way,
that
blacks
can't
represent
whites
and
whites
can't
represent
blacks.
what
it
is
doing
is
erasing
us
as
individuals.
we
should--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--no,
i
don't
think
you're
saying
all--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--but
i
think
what
you're
saying,
you're
making
again,
it
is
just
as--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
if
being
a
polish
american
is
a
suspect
classification,
it's
the
same--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--i
think
it's...
i
think
you're
making
an
assumption
of
it
being
a
benefit,
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it
is
a
stereotype--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--i'm
not
at
all
sure,
and
i
think
that
black
legislators,
who
knows,
but
i
think
that...
those
are
the
presumptions
that
we
cannot
rest
on.
and
let
me
say
again,
you
come
back
to
the
jury
selection
cases
i
find
extremely
helpful
in
this
regard,
because
what
is
the
prosecutor
doing
but
making
assumptions
about
how
blacks
or
white
or
men
or
women
are
going
to
vote
in
a
particular
case,
and
it
is
that
stereotypical
assumption,
even
if
it
has
some
factual
basis--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--that
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
problem.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
i
think
this
court
in
shaw
did
deal
with
ujo
and
probably
dealt
with
it
about
right.
i
mean,
ujo
was
filed
as
a
vote
dilution
case.
it
was
not
filed
and
was
not
pursued
as
this
case
is
being
pursued.
this
case
is
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
classifying
voters
by
race
is
precluded
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
how
you
prove
that
is
a
different
question,
and
it's
difficult,
and
there's
going
to
be
difficult
problems
of
proof
in
some
cases.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
it
would
be
a
very
hard
proof.
that's
a
very
different
case
for
two
reasons.
number
1,
when
you
join
a
political
party
you're
making
a
choice.
by
contrast,
when
the
state
makes
assumptions
about
you
as...
because
of
the
color
of
your
skin,
the
state
is
engaged
in
prohibited
racial
stereotyping.
number
2,
this
court's
precedents
make
a
distinction
between
race
and
political
considerations.
justice
brennan
said
it
very
eloquently
in
the
ujo
case.
this
court
recognized
that
again
in
shaw.
this
court
has
a
line
that
it
has
drawn
between
political
gerrymandering
and
racial
stereotyping,
which
is
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
we
suggest
that
what
this
court
said
in
arlington
was
that
it
mus
be
a
substantial
motivating
factor
to
create
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
but
substantial
motivating
and
predominant
first
of
all
i
think
are
simply
semantic--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--distinctions,
but
let
me
say
secondly,
under
arlington
heights,
substantial
motivating
factor
is
what
triggers...
what
creates
a
prima
facie
case.
the
state
always
has
an
opportunity
to
come
back
and
say
no,
it's
not
the--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--predominant
factor.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
i
really
don't
think
that's
the
case.
this
court
relied
from
the
very
outset
on
this
court...
i
mean,
the
district
court
relied
from
the
very
outset
on
this
court's
decisions
in
arlington
and
wright
v.
rockefeller,
and
they
conducted
three
long
hearings
of
2
days
each,
and
had
it
simply
been
a
matter
of,
was
race
considered
at
all,
well,
it
would
have
been
an
easy
case.
what
they
found
on
the
record
was
that
race
was
the
fundamental
factor,
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
court's
opinion,
fundamental
factor
driving
act
1
was
race.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
justice
ginsburg,
we
address
that
in
our
brief,
and
we
said
that
if
a
suspect
classification
becomes
the
touchstone,
it's
invalid.
we
used
the
kiryas
joel
case
as
an
example
of
that
and
several
justices
on
this
court
actually
cited
shaw
in
connection
with
their
opinions
in
that
case.
the
question
is,
and
it
was
in
that
case,
the
defining
feature
was
the
hasidic
sect,
the
satmar
sect,
and
that,
if
it
becomes
the
touchstone,
is,
i
think,
the
basis
for
invalidation.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
not
at
all.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
no,
not
at
all.
i
mean,
i--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--because
that
is
the
racial
stereotyping.
the
question--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--no,
no,
no.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
the
question--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--these
are
always
going
to
be
difficult
factual
questions,
but
it's
a
different
issue.
what
is
the
boundary
of
the
community?
in
justice
scalia's
question,
the
social
aspects
of
the
community
are
helping
to
define
the
community.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
right.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
race
is
different,
and
it's
not
just
race,
it
is
suspect
classifications.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
race
comes
into
play
in
lots
of
decisions
that
are
made
in
society
which
are
subject
to
the
arlington
heights
analysis.
this
is
not
the
only
place
where
the
decisionmaker
is
going
to
be
aware
of
race.
the
question
is
factual.
the
question
is
difficult
sometimes.
a
lot
of
times
it's
easy.
here
it's
easy.
here
it's
easy
because
the
district
court
held
three
separate
hearings,
it
sorted
through
all
the
facts,
it
heard
all
the
evidence,
it's
evident,
self
evident,
i
think,
to
anyone
who
examines
the
record
that
this
district
was
drawn
based
on
race,
it
split
parishes,
cities,
it
was
designed
for
this
purpose.
there
can
be
hard
cases,
sure.
there's
going
to
be
hard
cases
under
any
arlington
heights
analysis,
but
this
court
has
concluded...
this
court
did
conclude
in
gingles,
when
we're
talking
about
difficult
factual
questions
like
this,
that
the
district
court's
judgment
should
be
respected
unless
the
decision
is
clearly
erroneous,
unless
the
findings
are
clearly
erroneous,
and
here
they
plainly
are
not
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
difficult
to
contain.
i
think
most
districts
nationwide,
the
majority
of
any
race,
are
there
because
that's
where
the
communities
are
and
we
don't
have
this
problem,
but
let
me
tell
you
the
problem,
and
that
is
that
the
justice
department
has
a
program
which
is
maximizing
the
number
of
majority
minority
districts
nationwide
and
forcing
states
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
racial
stereotyping
that
is
at
issue
here.
that
is
the
problem.
if
the
justice
department
were
to
follow
beer
and
back
away
from
a
maximization
approach,
we
would
have
far
fewer
challenges,
and
most
of
these
problems
could
be
resolved
by
district
courts
if
and
when
challenges
are
made.
these
challenges
are
being
made--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--thank
you.
