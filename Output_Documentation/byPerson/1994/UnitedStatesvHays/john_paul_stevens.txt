justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
tried
to
avoid
it
once.
can
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question
that's
been
running
through
my
mind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
heart
of
the
case
you
say
is
driven
by
race.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
state
legislature
had
two
alternative
plans
to
consider,
both
of
which
had
completely
compact
districts,
had
followed
state
county
lines,
or
parish
lines,
were
equal
in
population,
they
were
equal
in
all
respects
in
terms
of
neutral
factors
except
one.
in
one
plan
there
are
two
majority
minority
districts,
in
the
other
plan
there
are
no
majority
minority
districts,
and
the
history
of
the
case,
the
legislative
history,
is
perfectly
clear
that
everybody
in
the
legislature
unanimously
voted
for
the
two
minority
minority
districts,
minority
majority,
simply
because
they
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
state
of
louisiana
to
have
two
black
congresspersons.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
it
is
your
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
assuming...
i'm
trying
to
follow
up
on
justice
o'connor's
question
as,
how
important
is
the
shape
of
the
district,
and
i'm
assuming
there's
no
shape
problem
at
all
in
my
hypothetical--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
no
doubt
at
all
about
the
controlling
factor
in
the
decision
between
these
two
plaintiffs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
unconstitutional
in
my
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
their
only
reason,
in
my
example--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--their
only
reason
is
they
think
they
have
a
history
they're
not
proud
of,
and
they
would
like
to
have
two
black
representatives
in
congress.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course--
--now,
supposing
the
other
choice
is,
the
majority
in
fact
voted
the
other
way
and
said,
we'll
vote
for
the
other
plan
because
we
don't
want
two
black
representatives.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
couldn't
choose
either
one.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
it's
the
predominant
consideration
for
only
those
legislators
who
are
frank
in
their
voting
in
the
legislature.
they
said
candidly
what
they
were
doing
and
others
said
nothing.
when
does
it
become
predominant?
does
it
have
to
be
a
majority
that
say
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
requires
a
careful
examination
of
legislative
history
to
find
out
what
the
real
motive
was,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
warren,
does
it
make
that
assumption
really
that
all
will
vote
the
same
way,
or
that
a
sufficient
number
of
them
will
vote
the
same
way
to
make
a
political
judgment
that
makes
sense,
such
as
all
catholics
tend
to
vote
in
a
certain
way
in
the
city
of
chicago
or
all
polish
americans
tend
to
vote
in
a
certain...
are
you
saying
they
are
all
going
to
vote
the
same
way?
i
don't
think
anybody
thinks--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you're
just
saying
there's
a
political
reality
at
work
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
invidious
to
assume
that
all
blacks--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
it
less
invidious
to
assume
that
all
polish
americans
will
vote
the
same
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
only
if
it's
a
suspect
classification
that
you
don't
get
the
benefit
of
being
able
to
have
your
group
interest
treated
as
a
group
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
certainly,
don't
you
think
more
black
legislators
would
have
voted
for
this
plan
than
against
it,
and
is
it
invidious
to
make
that
political--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
why
isn't
the
fact
that
they
typically
vote
together
sufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean,
it's
a
stereotype
if
it's
a
social
affinity--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
mean,
a
stereotype
if
it's
a
political
affinity
but
not
a
stereotype
if
it's
a
social
affinity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
then
doesn't...
wouldn't
proof
that
they
in
fact
have
a
social
affinity
overcome
the
presumption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
can
take
judicial
notice
of
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
can't
take
similar
judicial
notice
whenever
the
characteristic
is
a
racial
characteristic,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
normally
race
is
different
because
it's
normally
totally
irrelevant
to
the
decision.
but
see,
in
this
case,
apparently
louisiana
made
a
decision
that
it
was
not
irrelevant,
and
therefore
the
normal
reason
for
strict
scrutiny
does
not
apply.
