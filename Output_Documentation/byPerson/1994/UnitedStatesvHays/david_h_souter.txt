justice
david
h.
souter
general,
may
i
go
sort
of
behind
your
present
argument
to
what
i
understand
your
brief
to
say
and
raise
a
question
about
that?
as
i
understand
it,
the
point
of
what
you're
arguing
now
is
that
because
this
district
is
not
bizarre,
since
it...
on
historical
grounds
there's
nothing
that
unusual
about
it,
there
shouldn't
be
any
strict
scrutiny
applied
at
all,
because
you
say
shaw
and
reno
requires
bizarreness
as
sort
of
the
threshold
showing
in
order
to
require
a
strict
scrutiny
analysis,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
have
been
assuming,
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
just
as
you
would
try
to
define
bizarre
by
what
is
traditional,
that
you
would
probably
argue,
and
i
guess
i
have
assumed,
that
what
is
sufficiently
compact
for
the
gingles
test
probably
has
the
same
sort
of
historical
criterion.
if
it's
compact
to
the
degree
it
historically
has
been,
that's
compact
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
here's
the
problem
i
have
with
the
argument.
if
that
is
going
to
be
the
condition
upon
which
we
apply
strict
scrutiny,
then
once
we
find
that
a
district
is
bizarre
enough
to
be
subject
to
the
scrutiny,
it's
necessarily
going
to
flunk
the
gingles
test,
so
that
it
could
never,
in
effect,
be
justified
as
necessary
or
reasonably
necessary
to
avoid
a
section
2
violation.
conversely,
if
it
doesn't
flunk
the
gingles
test,
if
it's
not
bizarre,
then
if
we
adopt
your
position
or
adopt
the
bizarreness
position,
we
would
never,
at
least,
be
scrutinizing
it
for
any
other
purpose.
we
would,
for
example,
never
get
to
the
point
of
scrutinizing
it
for
packing.
how
do
we
get
out
of
that
bind,
that
if
we
scrutinize
it
at
all
it's
necessarily
going
to
flunk.
if
we
don't
scrutinize
it,
we
never
would
look
to
other
violations
such
as
a
packing
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
your
argument
was...
i
realize
that's
what
we're
all
going
to
do
in
the
first
instance,
but
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
whether
we
ultimately
classify
it
as
bizarre
or
not
is
going
to
depend
on
whether
it
departs
significantly
from
what
had
been
produced
by
non...
we
assume
nonracial
districting
in
the
past,
so
that
we
may
start
out
by
looking
at
it,
but
ultimately
what
we're
going
to
do
on
your
theory
is,
is
to
ask,
is
this
like
what
we
used
to
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
but
then
how
do
we
solve
the
problems
that
are
bothering
me?
how
do
we
solve
the
problem
that
if
it's
bizarre
enough
to
scrutinize,
it
necessarily
is
going
to
flunk
the
test?
maybe
that's
the
easy
part.
and
how
do
we
also
solve
the
problem
that
if
it's
not
bizarre
enough
to
scrutinize,
we
wouldn't
look
for
other
violations
such
as
packing?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
your
view--
--as
i
understand
it,
what
you're
saying
is
that,
you're
saying
we
should
read
what
we...
what
the
majority
said
in
shaw
is
a
mechanism
basically
to
make
the
first
cut
so
that
every
time
there
is
not
an
automatically
litigable
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
my
problem
is,
why
isn't
that
also
going
to
function
for
reasons
raised
in
my
question
as
a
last
cut?
in
other
words,
if
you
flunk
the
bizarreness
test,
you're
necessarily
going
to
flunk
any
attempt
to
get
a
section
2
justification
because
it
won't
be
compact
with
gingles.
conversely,
if
you
pass
the
bizarreness
test
based
on
historical
comparison
you
don't
look
at
anything
else,
like
packing?
how
do
we
get
out
of
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
shaw
and
reno
basically
is
just
one
entrance
gate
to
equal
protection.
it's
not
exclusive.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
there
be
an
opportunity
to
justify
it
on
avoiding
section
5?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
simply
is
the
state's
autonomous
effort
to...
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
in
the
jury
cases
the
people
who
are
objecting
are
rather
narrowly
identified.
it
is
a
party
who
can
challenge,
and
it
is
a
party
who
can
challenge
based
upon
the
interests
of
excluded
jurors,
not
on
the
basis
of
the
whole
world,
or
the
whole
state
population.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
but
if
i
happen
to
be
going
about
my
business
on
the
street
below
the
courthouse
and
i
find
that,
or
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
discriminatory
jury
selection
is
going
on,
i
can't
walk
in
and
be
given
standing
to
object
to
it,
and
yet
the
analogy
is
that
if
i
am
at
the
furthest
corner
of
louisiana
i
can
do
precisely
that
with
respect
to
this
district.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
warren,
may
i
ask
you
just
to
clarify
something
about
your
position?
when
you
were
addressing
justice
breyer's
question,
one
of
the
things
he
said
that
was
bothering
him
was
how
we
deal
with
the
concept
of
predominant
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
understand
it,
your
position
is
not
that
it
must
be
the
predominant
purpose.
if
it
is
a
motivating
factor
at
all,
that
is
sufficient
to
trigger
the
scrutiny
on
your
position,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
predominant.
justice
david
h.
souter
academic
distinctions.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
the
judge
then
in
this
particular
case
go
too
far?
i
take
it
what
you're
describing
is
the
criterion
that
the
judge
in
the
johnson
case
used.
didn't
the
judge
in
this
case
take
a
more...
adopt
a
lower
threshold
for
strict
scrutiny
than
yours?
