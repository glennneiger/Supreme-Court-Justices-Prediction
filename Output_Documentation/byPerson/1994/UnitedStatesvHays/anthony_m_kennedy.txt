justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
you
accept
that
fact,
do
you
draw
these
districts
in
order
to
perpetuate
that
practice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
to
try
and
eliminate
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
agree
that
in
the
shaw
v.
reno
context
it
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution
to
draw
a
district
with
the
predominant
purpose
of
composing
it
on
the
basis
of
one
race,
or
substantially
one
race.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
itself,
i
take
it,
is
the
evil
that
the
constitutional
protection
is
designed
to
prevent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
that
is
so,
why
should
it
be
confined
just
to
districts
with
an
irregular
shape?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
other
than
the
precedent,
what
would
be
the
explanation
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view,
why
should
that
be
a
constitutional
violation
under
shaw?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
chief
justice
is
right.
all
you're
imposing
is
a
visual
test,
and
that
makes
very
little
sense
to
me,
other
than
that
as
one
threshold
indicator
of
the
prohibited
intent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
they
contend
that
the
zorro
district
was
correctly
designed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
assuming
that
their
contention,
and
i
think
that
would
be
their
contention,
is
that
both
the
zorro
district
and
this
district
are
improper,
how
have
they
been
mistreated
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
except
for
the
zorro,
their
brief
residence
in
the
evanescent
zorro
district,
how
are
they
any
different
from
any
citizen
in
louisiana,
following
justice
souter's
question?
it
seems
to
me
you're
arguing
for
a
generalized
standing,
which
i
think
would
take
us
quite
beyond
our
existing
case
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
have
to
show
some
particularized
injury,
and
i'm
simply
asking
you
how
your
plaintiffs
are
different
than
plaintiffs
in
any
other
part
of
the
state,
other
than
the
fact
they're
contiguous,
but
they
would
have
always
been
contiguous,
other
than
the
zorro
district,
which
they,
too,
challenged.
