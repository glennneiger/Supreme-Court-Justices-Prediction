justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
statute
it
says,
incidental
powers,
right?
the
word
is
"incidental".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
what
i'd
like
to
know...
and
i
take
it
there
are
then
some
semicolons
and
a
number
of
things
listed,
and
nowhere
is
listed
the
word,
securities,
yet
somebody
at
some
point
must
have
thought
that
"incidental"
includes
securities,
which
isn't
listed,
otherwise
they
wouldn't
have
written
the
second
sentence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
now,
what
is...
and
if
you
can
say
it
in
a
sentence
or
so,
what
is
the
comptroller's
basic
theory
of
how
you
define
that
word,
"incidental"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
can
he
put
anything
in
under
the
sun?
i
mean,
he
must
have
some
theory
as
to
how
you
get
this
word
"incidental",
which
couldn't
be
limited
just
to
the
next
six
clauses,
but
can't
include
everything
in
the
world,
so
what
is
the
basic
theory
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that...
but
isn't
that
the
crucial
point,
really,
which
makes
us
not
like
insurance?
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
that
insurance
in
its
heartland
concept
is
a
group
of
people
in
this
room
get
together
and
they
think
something
bad
might
happen
to
them,
and
they
say,
if
something
bad's
going
to
happen
to
us,
at
least
we'll
get
some
money,
and
so
what
they're
doing
is,
they're
worried
about
a
risk
of
bad
things
that
are
going
to
happen.
they're
called
risk-averse.
so
they
put
up
some
money
now,
a
little
bit,
and
then
if
something
bad
happens
they
get
a
lot
more.
that
helps
them
feel
better,
all
right,
or
other
things.
this
isn't
that
at
all
from
the
insurance
company's
point
of
view.
maybe
you
measure
it
and
decide
what
the
price
is
going
to
be,
because
you
take
life
into
account.
that's
a
decision
as
to
what
you're
going
to
charge.
but
what
the
person's
buying
is
not
some
protection
against
some
bad
thing
happening
to
them.
he's
buying
an
income
stream
that
happens
to
be
measured
by
his
life,
just
as
if
he
bought
a
coupon,
a
bond,
or
some
other
thing,
or
a
black
acre
for
his
life,
or
a
condominium
in
florida
for
his
life.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
rather
heartland
difference,
even
though
i
absolutely
concede
that
insurance
companies
sell
this
kind
of
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes,
life
insurance--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
correct.
you
sell
a
lot
of
things
under
the
name,
insurance,
that
other
people
also
sell.
i'm
not
denying
that
insurance
companies
sell
this
kind
of
thing.
all
i'm
saying
is...
and
it's
a
question...
isn't
this
somewhat
removed
from
the
heartland
of
what
we
think
of
as
normal
insurance,
and
doesn't
that
fact,
or
why
doesn't
it,
even
though
insurance
companies
certainly
sell
this,
doesn't
that
make
a
difference,
or
does
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
going
to
say
it
doesn't
make
a
difference,
or
you're
going
to
say
it
isn't
different,
but
i'm
interested
in
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
when
life
insurance
is
bought,
normally
people
say,
when
a
bad
thing
happens
to
me,
i
don't
know
when,
i'll
at
least
have
some
money
for
my
children.
now,
people
buy
it
for
other
reasons,
like
investment,
and
so
it
isn't
necessarily
100
percent
that
way.
i'm
drawing
a
difference,
and
what
i'm
driving
towards
is
this:
why
isn't
this
more
like
banking
than
stocks
and
bonds?
people
put
money
in
a
bank
account,
and
the
bank
pays
interest,
so
instead
of
the
bank
paying
interest,
the
bank
one
day
says,
i'll
tell
you
what
we'll
do,
we'll
save
all
this
money
for
you,
and
then
we'll
pay
it
back
to
you
with
some
interest
later
on
when
you
retire,
in
equal
monthly
payments.
now,
people
do
put
money
in
banks
all
the
time,
and
they
do
want
to
get
back
this
money.
why
isn't
this
more
like
banking
than
taking
your
money
and
buying
a
stock
and
bond?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
mean
if
insurance
companies...
this
is...
they're
not
selling
life
insurance,
they're
selling
something
called
an
annuity,
and
i
agree
that
insurance
companies
also
sell
annuities.
you're
saying
that
92
means
that
if
insurance
companies
decide
to
sell
off
their
real
estate...
they
have
a
lot
of
bad
real
estate
investments...
or
if
they...
is
it
whatever
insurance
companies
do
that
they
can't
do?
what
is
the
interpretation
of
that,
92?
i
mean,
whatever
insurance
companies
used
to
sell,
that
means
banks,
or
if
insurance
companies
sold
a
lot
of
it...
is...
how
does
that
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
insurance...
mutual
funds
also
involve
the
pooling
of
risk.
bond
funds
also
involve
the
pooling
of
risk.
lots
of
things
involve
the
pooling
of
risk.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if,
in
fact--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
all
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
if
real
estate
companies
pool
condominiums,
and
sell
condominiums
for
people's
life,
that
also
is
in
the...
the
banks
couldn't
do
that,
either?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
you
could
have...
pool
condominiums.
people
sell
condominiums,
a
life
estate
in
a
condominium.
i
don't
know
if
that's
a
comparable
thing
or
not,
but
you
can
use
2
weeks
in
florida
in
this
house
for
the
rest
of
your
life.
big
insurance
companies
might
sell
those
things.
would
that
also...
is
anything
that's
measured,
that's
a
pool
and
it's
measured
by
a
person's
life,
is
that
the
definition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
sorry,
i
don't
quite
understand,
because
i
have
in
front
of
me
two
sentences
from
section
24(7).
we
know
what
those
two
sentences
are,
right?
all
right.
now,
are
you
saying
that
in
the
statute
books
there's
some
other
sentence
some
place
that
affirmatively
gives
to
banks
the
authority
to
sell
securities?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
answer's
no.
all
right.
so
the
only
sentences...
i'm
just
looking
at
the
words.
i
just
want
to
look
at
the
words.
you're
appealing
to
the
legislative
history,
i
think,
aren't
you?
no,
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
just
not
looking
at
the
legislative
history.
i'm
just
looking
at
the
words.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
wants
to--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're...
i
misunderstood
you,
too.
you're
saying
that
the
predecessor
sentence
of
the
sentence
which
now
is
the
final
one
in
section
7
extended
that
authority.
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
i
understand
you.
