mr.
david
overlock
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
by
talking
about
the
pooling
question
that
was
just
being
discussed
here
by
mr.
rosenthal,
because
it
seems
to
us
very
critical
here
to
understand
the
nature
of
insurance,
because
the
comptroller
misstated
in
his
definition
of
insurance.
he
said
that
insurance
is
indemnification
against
risk
of
loss,
and
that
is
not
the
case.
that
is
a
description
of
casualty
insurance.
life
insurance
and
annuities
are
insurance,
but
they
do
not
involve
indemnification
against
risk
of
loss.
the
elements
of
insurance
are,
in
fact,
pooling
and
sharing
of
risk,
which
mr.
rosenthal
said.
that's
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
cases
in
trying
to
construe
the
term,
the
business
of
insurance.
if
you
take
a
life
insurance
situation,
the
people
who
buy
the
life
insurance
are
insuring
against
the
loss
of
income
due
to
death
for
the
benefit
of
their
dependents,
and
the
people
who
die...
let's
make
sure
i
get
this
correct.
the
people
who
die
early
are
subsidized
by
the
premiums
paid
by
the
people
who
die
late.
in
annuities,
you
are...
the
annuity
purchaser
is
insuring
against
the
loss
of
income
for
the
annuity
purchaser,
because
loss
of
income
ordinarily
accompanies
age
and
retirement,
and
the
people
who
die
late
end
up
subsi...
boy,
i'm
afraid
i'm
going
to
get
it
wrong.
[laughter]
there
is
a
pooling
of
risk,
and
the
people
who...
between
the
people
who
die
early
and
the
people
who
die
late.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
i'm
very
grateful.
[laughter]
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
i
think
you've
crystallized,
in
fact,
the
problem,
because
your
description
also
would
apply
to
life
insurance--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--delineated
as
insurance.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--i
think
it
does
not
make
a
difference,
because
when
you're
dealing
with
the
risk
of
life
and
death,
it
is
not
that
the
risk
may
not
happen.
that's
what
you
have
with
an
indemnity
policy.
you
have
a
risk
that
may
not
occur.
you
may
not
suffer
a
loss,
and
that's
where
the
comptroller
got
off
the
tracks
by
going
off
on
indemnification
against
risk
of
loss.
for
annuities
and
insurance,
you're
dealing
with
the
risk
of
mortality.
that
risk
will
happen.
we
will
die.
the
only
question
is
when--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--and
the
timing
of
your
death,
the
stream
of
income
that
is
generated
by
your
life
is
what
you
will
insure.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
well,
your
honor,
i
think
this
is
an
elegant
theoretical
construct,
but
i
don't
think
it's
the
way
that
the
pooling
of
risk
has
been
viewed
in
insurance
and
in
fact
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
you
look
at
section
92,
for
example,
which
talks
specifically
only
in
extending
insurance
powers
for
representation
of
a
life
insurance
company
as
well
as
others.
so
congress
clearly
was
thinking
of
a
life
insurance
company
as
selling
insurance.
that's
right
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
that
the
national
bank
in
a
small
town
is
permitted
to
sell
insurance
as
agent
for
a
fire,
life,
or
other
insurance
company,
so
although
this
may
be
a
theoretical
possibility,
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
context
of
this
case
available
as
an
outcome.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
of
course
not,
because
annuity
product
does
involve
the
pooling
of
risk,
the
risk
of
outliving
your
income,
the
risk
of
a
penniless
old
age.
it
does
involve
an
investment
component
like
the
other
elements
of
whole
life
insurance.
we
always
recognized
that.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
but
it
also
has
an
insurance
component.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
you
do
not
have
one
purchaser
subsidizing
the
loss
or
gain
of
another
purchaser,
that's
the
difference,
and
what...
in
the
life
insurance
and
in
annuities,
the
difference
is,
what
you
get
depends
upon
when
you
die--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--and
that
is
uniquely
different--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--from
mutual
funds
or
any
other
type
of--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--i
didn't
understand
the--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--i
think
if
you're
protecting
against
a
risk
of
loss
and
it
involves
the
pooling
and
sharing,
you
do,
in
fact,
have
insurance.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
true,
your
honor,
because
the
annuity
begins
to
pay
at
the
maturity
date.
it
can
begin
immediately,
but
it's
more
customary
at
a
maturity
date
which
is
often
coincident
with
the
retirement
date,
and
it
is
designed
to
ensure
that
there
will
be--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--i
think
most
people
assume
their
income
will
go
down.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
well,
it
is
a
contractual
relationship.
it
goes
on
regardless
of
the
individual
circumstances
of
the
annuity
purchaser,
but
the
fact
remains,
from
the
company's
standpoint
and
from
the
purchaser's
standpoint,
they
are
pooling
their
risk
with
the
other
purchasers
of
that
annuity
product.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
i
can
only
refer
you
to
the
many
insurance
treatises
which
deal
with
exactly
this
issue,
and
agree
that
that
is
what
people
are
doing,
and
if
you
look,
people
are
buying
life
contingency
annuities.
they
want
to
have
that...
they
are
preserving
income
for
their
lives.
that
is,
it
seems
to
me
is
direct
support
for
what
we
are
trying
to
say
here.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
they...
the
difference
is,
i
think,
that
what
you
get
depends
on
how
long
you
live.
it
is
a
different
type
of
arrangement
both
from
the
issuer's
standpoint
and
the
purchaser.
if
the
purchaser
really
wanted
simply
to
save,
the
purchaser
could
buy
a
term
certain
annuity.
this
is
a
very
small
part
of
the
annuity
market.
that
is
just
an
annuity
for
10
years.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
live
or
die.
your
heirs
or
beneficiaries
will
get
that
annuity
payment
if
you
die
before
the
end
of
it.
that
is
a
very
small
part
of
the
market,
and
the--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--we
think...
the
pooling
of
risk
is
not
present
there,
yes,
that's
true.
it
is
not
clear
that
nationsbank
has
asked
to
do
that,
or
the
comptroller
has
raised
the
issue.
i
don't
think
it's
before
the
court.
but
we
do
recognize
the
pooling
of
risk
is
not
present
there.
those
annuities
are
regulated
as
insurance.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
well,
it
is
a
small
part
of
the
market,
and
my
point
was
simply
that
the
purchaser's
annuities
are
not
taking
the
pure
tax-deferred
benefit
which
is
being
posited
by
the
court
here,
but
rather,
they're
choosing
the
product
which
provides
also
this
insurance
characteristic,
the
life
definition
of
their
benefits.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
because
that
is
an
individualized
transaction.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--i
think
that
we
also
do
have
to
look
at
the
traditions
of
regulation
of
insurance
in
this
country
at
some
point,
and
at
that
point--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--i
don't
want
to
be--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--if
annuities
had
changed
in
any
material
way,
that
would
be
possibly
true,
but
we
think
annuities
in
their
core
really
are
exactly
the
same
as
they
were
100
years
ago
or
50
years
ago
or
80
years
ago.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
variable
annuities
are
the
single
innovation,
you're
exactly
right.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
they
were
not
sold
then.
they
came
on
the
scene
in
the
fifties.
about
75
to
85
percent
of
the
market,
according
to
the
petitioner's
source,
is
currently
fixed
annuities,
not
variables.
the
variable
annuities
have
been
held
by
this
court
to
include
a
securities
element,
but
there's
also
an
insurance
element
that
is
retained
in
the
variable
annuities.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
no,
your
honor.
the
enumerated
powers
of
banking
have
been
crystallized,
really,
as
three:
taking
of
deposits,
the
extending
of
credit,
and
the
exchanging
of
credits.
it
has
nothing
to
do...
the
sale
of
a
variable
annuity
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
those.
now,
a
question
has
been...
and
it's
been
unclear,
i
think,
in
the
argument
from
petitioners
as
to
whether
the
second
sentence
of
this
provision,
section
24(7),
is
really
at
issue
here,
the
business
of
dealing
in
stocks
and
securities.
the
comptroller
expressly
excluded
reliance
upon
that
provision.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rely
on
it,
either,
so
we
think
that
question
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
we
think
not,
because
they're
a
different
kind
of
security,
and
here
it's
necessary
to
harmonize
the
provision
there
with
the
provision
of
section
92,
which
we
do
think
has
a
powerful
negative
implication,
because
variable
annuities
have
both
security
and
insurance
characteristics.
i
think
justice
kennedy's
question
was
on
point
on
that.
they
do
have
both
characteristics.
banks
have
been
allowed
to
sell
securities,
but
the
assumption
in
that
has
been,
these
are
tradable
securities.
annuities
are
not
like
that.
they're
not
that
kind
of
security,
and
in
order
to
harmonize
that,
because
they're
also
insurance,
harmonize
it
with
section
92,
it's
necessary
that
they
not
be
an
instrument
that
can
be
handled
by
national
banks.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
well,
i
think
there's
some
confusion
here,
because
the
initial
stock
and
security
trading
power
for
national
banks
was
created
by
the
mcfadden
act
in
1927,
and
that
was
an
affirmative
grant
of
power.
in
the
1930's,
the
glass-steagall
act
amendment
that
and
basically
rendered
it
in
the
current
form
to
prevent
national
banks
from
selling
other
types
of
products.
what
this
court
has
said
is,
that
was
the
first
time
national
banks
were
authorized
to
sell
them.
the
comptroller,
in
a
technique
somewhat
akin
to
what
has
happened...
he's
done
here
did,
prior
to
that,
tell
national
banks
that
they
could,
in
fact,
start
to
sell
debt
securities,
and
there
was
some
development
in
that
area
which
became
very
controversial
during
the
depression.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
well,
i
think
if,
in
fact,
that
issue,
the
bank's
ability
to
sell
securities,
had
come
to
this
court
in
1925,
the
decision
of
this
court
would
have
had
to
be
that
they
lacked
the
power
to
do
so.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
well,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
i
think
we're
getting
this
turned
upside
down,
because
in
fact
congress
had
to
grant
that
power
because
the
banks
didn't
have
the
power,
just
as,
if
banks
are
really
to
have
the
power
to
sell
annuities,
congress
is
going
to
have--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--your
honor,
i
don't
read
it
that
way.
i
think
the
form
of
that
statute
has
to
be
understood
in
the
sequence
between
the
mcfadden
act
and
the
glass-steagall
act,
which
cut
back
on
a
preexisting
power
which
had
been
created
only
6
or
7
years
earlier,
and
that
accounts
for
the
form
of
it.
there
was
a
preexisting
power,
but
it
was
unauthorized,
and
we
think
that
by
congress
authorizing
it,
going
to
that
step--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--by
which
i
mean
it
had
been
approved
by
the
comptroller
but
was
not
legal,
and
that
if
it
had
been
tested
in
the
courts
it
would
have
been
found
illegal.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
i
think
if
you
look
back,
and
this
issue
has
not
been
briefed
in
this
case,
and
it
has
not
been
developed
by
the
comptroller,
and
it
has
not
been
developed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
so
this
court
is
coming
to
it
in
the
first
instance,
but
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
mcfadden
act
and
the
way
that
was
written,
then
that
will
explain
why
the
glass-steagall
act,
that
sentence
now
is
written
in
such
a
way--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--i
think
that's
what
this
court
found
in
clarke
v.
securities
industries
association,
yes.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
well,
it's
first
form
was
enacted
in
1927
in
the
mcfadden
act,
and
then
it
was
amended
in
the
glass-steagall
act.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
'33
or
'34.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
no.
i'm
saying
the--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--second
sentence
was
rewritten.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
well--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--i
don't
think
that
was
a
helpful--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--i'm
referring
to
the
development
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
authorized
those
activities,
yes.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
i
did
want
to
talk
just
a
second
about
the
sequence
of
the
statutes
here,
because
it
seems
to
us
very
important.
section
24(7)
was
adopted
in
1863.
it
included
an...
the
incidental
powers
clause
without
change
for
the
last
130
years.
in
1915
and
1916,
almost
50
years...
more
than
50
years
later,
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
comptroller
concluded...
and
now
it's...
the
national
banks
had
no
insurance
powers.
in
fact,
the
comptroller
said
insurance
was
an
outside
business
naturally
belonging
to
others.
now,
he
then
asked
for
a
statute
to
be
enacted
to
allow
the
banks
and
small
towns,
national
banks
and
small
towns
to
exercise
these
powers,
and
specifically
he
specified
that
it
would
be
unwise
and
undesirable
to
give
it
to
the
banks
in
larger
towns.
this
sequence,
it
seems
to
us,
is
very
powerful,
because
the
comptroller
is
saying
that
in
1990
he's
all
of
a
sudden
discovered
that
back
in
1863
that
statute
actually
authorized
insurance
sales
and
annuity
insurance...
sales
of
annuities
all
along,
and
i
think
that
renders
the
entire
sequence
in
1915
and
1916
really--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--well,
but
this
court
in
construing
section
24(7)
has
been
very
careful
to
tie
any
extension
to
those
powers
to
the
express
powers
enumerated
in
section
24(7).
as
justice
sutherland
wrote
in
the
first
national
bank
of
st.
louis
v.
missouri,
you
can
only
carry
into
effect
those
powers
which
are
granted.
incidental
powers
can
only
be
used
in
that
regard.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
yes,
and
of
course,
that's
a
very
fair
point,
which
is,
the
statute
does
not
say
the
business
of
banks.
it
says,
the
business
of
banking,
which
must
mean
something
more,
and
indeed--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--absolutely
not.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
well...
i
don't
think
that
was
the
import.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
perhaps
i
misread
it.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
the...
we
think
that
the
express
powers
given
to
banks,
the
way
those
are
carried
into
effect
will
change
over
time.
for
example,
how
you
receive
deposits,
will
become
safety
deposit
boxes...
those
have
been
approved
by
this
court.
you
can
go
to
atm
machines.
these
are
all
developments,
but
it
relates
to
the
express
powers
of
the
banks.
the
banks...
the
business
of
banking
will
change.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
i
think
it
is
all
part
of
the
extension
of
credit,
which
is
authorized.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
yes.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
i
think
that
has
been
the
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
i
don't
have
it
before
me.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
that
has
been
read
to
involve
the
extension
of
credit,
because
personal
security
wouldn't
apply
to
corporations
as
well.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
it
has
been
read
to--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--extension
of
credit
generally,
and
we
think
that
is
fair.
that
is
contemplated.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
i
think
it
does
say
so,
your
honor.
what
it
does
not
say
is
that
there's
any
power
to
sell
insurance,
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
section
92
and
what
congress
was
doing
in
response
to
what
the
comptroller
said,
congress
was,
in
fact,
responding
to
this
need
only
to
grant
a
small
amount
of
insurance,
and
as
this
court
has
held,
powers
not
conferred
by
congress
are
denied
in
that
sort
of
setting.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
because
the
bank
itself
is
not
receiving
deposit
here.
it
is
acting
as
an
agent
for
an
insurance
company--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--in
a
context
where--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--well,
i
think
in
this
instance,
section
92
indicates
that
congress
addressed
this
and
specifically
indicated
that
it
did
not
want
banks
to
participate
in
this
kind
of
activity.
thank
you,
your
honor.
