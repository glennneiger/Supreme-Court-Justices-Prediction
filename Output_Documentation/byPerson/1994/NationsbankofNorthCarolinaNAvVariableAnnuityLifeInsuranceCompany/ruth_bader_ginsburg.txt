justice

bader

mr.
dumont,
before
you
go
on
with
that,
would
you
just
tell
us
the
expression,
business
of
banking,
you
said
that
the
six
specifics
are
exemplary,
not
exclusive.
where
would
one
look
to
find
the
limits
of
the
term,
business
of
banking,
or
are
there
no
limits
that...
that
emerge
from
the
text,
one
must
see
what
banks
are
doing
at
a
particular
point
in
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
banks
are
selling
annuities
now?
to
what
extent
are
banks
selling
annuities?
what
percent
of
the
market,
and
as
between
national
banks
and
state
banks?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
order
of
20
percent.
now,
suppose
we
do
not
accept
your
argument
about
the
comptroller
could
cover
lots
of
insurance
if
he
chose
to
do
so,
do
you
lose,
or
can
you
treat
annuities
discretely?
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question,
can
you
say,
even
if
the
banks
can't
touch
life
insurance,
still
they
can
allow
banks
to
engage
in
the
sale
of
annuities?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosenthal,
what
about
the
cases
that
this
court
had,
the
manhart
case
involving...
those
involved
annuities,
the
tia
craft
cases,
where
there
were...
there
was
a
pooling
male
and
female,
and
the
question
was
whether
that
was
lawful
under
title
vii,
but
that
was...
it
was
certainly
pooling
a
risk.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stewart,
why
isn't
it
appropriate
to
look
at
this,
as
justice
breyer
i
think
suggested,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
bank's
customer,
the
notion
that
the
customer
has
savings,
wants
to
invest
the
savings
for
a
return
that
will
be
there
for
a
rainy
day,
for
later
years,
and
that
an
annuity
is
today
a
substitute
for
that,
more
attractive,
but
it
serves
the
same
customer
who
has
savings
and
wants
to
invest
the
savings
for
a
return.
so
the
bank
is
serving
that
very
same
need
that
was
once
served
in
a
very
simple
way
and
now
there
are
more
ways
to
serve
it.
why
isn't
that...
if
you
look
at
the
bank
serving
its
customer,
the
depositor,
why
aren't
those
two
very
much
alike?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
you
could
sell,
you
say.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
brief
for
the
federal
petitioners
at
pages
34...
33
and
34,
there's
a
footnote
that
seems
to
indicate
that,
while
small,
it's
not
that
small,
the
kind
of
annuity
that
doesn't
depend
on
the
length
of
one's
life.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
think
the
argument
was
all
along.
i
think
it
was,
the
business
of
banking
changes
over
time,
and
i
think
as
mr.
rosenthal
put
it,
this
statute
is
like
some
other
statutes
that
are
meant
to
govern
a
business.
the
phrase,
"restraint
of
trade"
may
mean
something
different
today
than
it
meant
when
it
was
originally
put
in
the
sherman
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
second
opinion,
i
will
announce
covers
the
consolidated
cases
nationsbank
v.
variable
annuity
life
insurance
co.
and
ludwig
v.
variable
annuity
life
insurance
co.
we
hold
in
this
unanimous
decision
that
national
banks
may
serve
as
agents
in
the
sale
of
annuity.
annuities
are
contracts
under
which
the
issuer
receives
premiums
from
the
purchaser
in
exchange
for
a
continuing
series
of
payments.
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
who
is
the
officer
congress
charged
with
superintendence
of
national
banks,
determines
that
federal
law
permits
annuity
sales
as
a
service
to
bank
customers.
variable
annuity
life
insurance
company,
a
company
engaged
in
the
sale
of
annuities
challenged
the
comptroller's
decision.
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
texas
upheld
comptroller's
ruling,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
disagreed
and
declared
that
the
controller
had
incorrectly
interpreted
the
national
bank
act.
we
granted
the
petitions
for
review
of
the
comptroller
and
nations
bank,
the
national
bank
given
permissions
to
broker
annuities
and
we
now
reverse
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit.
when
the
interpretation
of
an
expert
administrator
such
as
the
comptroller
fills
a
statutory
gap
in
a
way
that
is
reasonable
in
light
of
congress’
revealed
design
courts
respect
the
administrator’s
judgment.
the
comptroller
we
conclude
reasonably
typed
annuity
sales
as
incidental
to
the
business
of
banking
under
the
relevant
provision
of
the
national
bank
act.
further,
he
reasonably
classified
annuities
as
investments
not
insurance
under
the
statutory
prescription
in
point.
as
the
comptroller
found
by
making
an
initial
payment
in
exchange
for
a
future
income
stream,
the
bank
customer
who
purchases
an
annuity
from
the
bank
is
deferring
consumption,
setting
aside
money
for
retirement,
future
expenses,
a
trip
around
the
world
or
a
rainy
day.
for
her,
an
annuity
is
like
putting
money
in
a
bank
account,
a
debt
instrument,
or
a
mutual
fund
and
attending
to
those
investments
for
customers
is
plainly
within
“the
business
of
banking.”
as
the
comptroller
further
found,
the
customer’s
investment
objectives
distinguished
annuity
from
insurance,
the
primary
purpose
of
which
is
to
indemnify
loss,
because
the
comptroller’s
reading
of
a
national
bank
act,
is
reasonable.
we
defer
to
that
reading.
