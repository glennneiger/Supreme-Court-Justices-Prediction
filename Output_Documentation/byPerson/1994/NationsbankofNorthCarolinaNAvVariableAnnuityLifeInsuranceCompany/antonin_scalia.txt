justice
antonin
scalia
--how
unlike
are
they
to
life
insurance
contracts?
why...
couldn't
you
make
the
same
argument
about
regular
life
insurance,
that
it's...
that
it's
a
form
of
investment?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
well,
no--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whole
life,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
always
been
considered...
whole
life
insurance,
anyway,
has
always
been
considered
a
medium
of
saving
and
investment
as
well
as
a
medium
of
life
insurance,
hasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
argument
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
at
least
insofar
as
straight
life
insurance...
not
term
insurance,
but
investment
life
insurance
is
concerned,
bank
could
have
been
life
insurance
agents.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that's
faithful
to
what
was
sought
to
be
achieved
by
this
amendment
regarding
insurance.
you
think
it
was
contemplated
that
banks
generally
could
engage
in
the
sale
of
whole
life
insurance.
i
find
that
very
difficult
to
credit.
i
just...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
very
likely.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
does
the
business
of
banking
besides...
besides
the
banks
that
are
restricted
by
this
very
provision?
where
does
one
get
the
concept
of
the
business
of
banking,
if
not
from
the
banks
that
are
governed
by
this
restriction,
which
restricts
them
to
the
business
of
banking?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
proper
interpretation
to
ask
under
that
statute,
whether
this
is
an
incidental
power?
that's
not
how
i
read
it.
i
would
think
the
question
is
whether
it
is
the
business
of
banking.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
doesn't
say,
colon,
to
discount
and
negotiate
promissory
notes,
to
loan
money,
et
cetera,
which
would
be
an
enumeration
of
the
incidental
powers.
it
rather
says,
to
conduct
the
business
of
banking
by,
rather
than
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
the
statistics
you
recited
just
before
your
answer
to
that
question,
are
they
applicable
to
fixed
annuities
as
well
as
variable?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is,
two-thirds
of
all
state
banks
sell
fixed
annuities?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
do
involve
a
pooling,
so
you're
focusing
on
the
word
whether
there's
a
risk
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
very
helpful
to
limit
somebody
to
the
business
of
banking
if
the
business
of
banking
means
anything
that
banks
want
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
do
in
sufficient
numbers.
