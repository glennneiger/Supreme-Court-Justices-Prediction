mr.
dumont,
may
i
ask
you
a
related
question?
just
assume...
i
know
you
don't
assume
this,
but
just
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
annuities
in
question
could
be
classified
either
as
securities
or
as
insurance.
just
take
that
as
a
given.
in
deciding
which
way
to
classify
them,
i
would
like
to
know,
if
we
do
know,
what
the
object
of
section
9
was.
i
have
assumed
that
the
object
of
section
92
was...
beyond
its
desire
to
help
out
the
little
banks
by
giving
them
an
extra
source
of
cash,
that
its
object
also
reflected
an
intent
to
protect
independent
insurance
brokers.
am
i
right?
and
if
i
am
right,
is
that
a
reason
for
construing
the...
for
saying
that,
other
things
being
equal,
we
ought
to
recognize
that
objective,
and
we
ought
to
construe
these
annuities
as
being
insurance
rather
than
securities
in
order
to
realize
the
protective
object
of
92?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
didn't
that
letter
also...
i
forget
the
exact
words,
but
didn't
that
letter
make
some
such
remark
as,
you
know,
it's
not
going
to
hurt
the
others
too
much?
they
said,
well,
you
know,
the
little
banks
will
be
able
to
make
a
little
money
on
this,
but
it's
not
going
to
hurt
the
others,
by
which
i
assume
they
meant
the
insurance
brokers?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
realize
it
was
doing
that,
but
that's
where
it
stopped,
and
why
would
it
have
stopped
unless
it
wanted
to
protect
insurance
brokers?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
know,
but
what
about
the
answer
to
my
question?
assuming
that
we
recognize
that
there's
a
limitation
there,
isn't
the
only
likely
object
of
the
limitation
to
protect
insurance
brokers?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
grant
you
that,
but
i
think
you're
getting
a
little
bit
away
from
my
question.
my
question
is,
why
did
they
put
the
limitation?
why
did
they
limit
it
to
the
small
banks,
and
was
there
any
reason
they
did
so,
except
to
protect
insurance
brokers?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
you
also
draw
an
intelligible
line
between
fixed
and
variable?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
are
if
the
two
terms
are
interchangeable
as
between
the
two
statutes,
but
if
we
assume
they're
not
necessarily
interchangeable,
i
take
it
the
insurance
character,
the
significance
of
the
actuarial
element
is
much
greater
in
the
case
of
a
fixed
annuity.
justice
david
h.
souter
aren't
there
two
other
problems
with
your
analogy?
you
say
that
what
is
being
insured
here
is
loss
of
in...
insurance
against
lost
income
from
living
too
long,
but
as
i
understand
it,
characteristically
the
income
stream
begins
regardless
of
whether
you
live
too
long
or
not,
and
it
begins
regardless
of
whether
you
have
other
income
or
not,
and
so
in
both
of
those
respects
there's
a
clear
distinction
from
kind
of
the
paradigm
case
of
casualty
insurance.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean,
most
people
don't
assume
that
they're
going
to
go
broke
on
their
retirement
date.
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it's
an
income
supplement
really,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
it's
not
a
benefit
that
accrues
only
if
one's
income
drops
below
a
certain
level.
if
the
person
retires
and
his
rich
uncle
leaves
him
millions
the
next
day,
he's
still
going
to
get
his
benefit,
so
it
doesn't
seem
to
have
that
feature
of
the
income
casualty
that
sets
it
going.
rather,
it
has
a
feature
of
income
planning.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
grant
you
that
there
is
a
pooling
going
on,
and
i
grant
you
that
there
is
an
actuarial
feature
in
deciding
what
you're
going
to
charge
for
what
you
do,
but
i
don't
think
there's
such
a
neat
analogy
as
suggested
by
the
notion
that
what
is
being
insured
against
is
loss
of
income
from
living
too
long,
because
the
triggering
events
are
simply
different
from
what
they
are
in
a
casualty
circumstance,
and
i
just...
i
guess
that's
why
i
think
the
analogy
is
weak
rather
than
strong.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
stewart,
you
may
already
have
alluded
to
this,
but
let
me
ask
you,
with
respect
to
your
argument
that
in
fact
the
enumerated
powers
are
essentially
exclusive,
do
you
agree
that
the
final
sentence
of
the
seventh
section
makes
no
sense,
except
on
the
congressional
assumption
that
the
enumeration
was
not
exclusive,
because
there's
nothing
in
the
enumeration
that
would
be
taken
to
refer
to
stocks
and
securities,
so
congress
must
have
assumed
that
in
fact
the
so-called
powers
incident
to
banking
were
broader.
how
do
you
deal
with
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
this
was
essentially
just
a
kind
of...
perhaps
a
misleading
and
untidy
way
to
deal
with
what
congress
took
as
a
fait
accompli?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
shouldn't
congress...
why
shouldn't
we
deal
with
a
fait
accompli
in
this
case?
the
banks
are
selling
all
of
this
stuff.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
now
we're
in
the
situation
in
which
the
1925
analogue
doesn't
work
with
respect
to
annuities,
either.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
if
it
was
appropriate...
i
guess
my
question
is,
if
it
was
appropriate
for
congress
to
write
the
final
sentence
on
the
assumption
that...
and
i
think
it
makes
no
logical
sense
otherwise...
on
the
assumption
that
the
bank's
incidental
powers
could
include
the
power
to
sell
stocks
and
securities,
and
congress
did
that
because
the...
you
know,
the
cat
was
out
of
the
bag,
then
why
isn't
it
equally
appropriate
for
us
to
construe
the
first
sentence
on
that
same
set
of
assumptions,
which
i
gather
would
put
us
in
the
same
interpretive
position
that
the
state
of
new
york
is
in
with
respect
to
its
statute,
which
was
taken
as
the
model
for
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
that's
all
congress
was
doing,
congress...
all
congress
had
to
say
is,
they
can
sell
stocks...
they
can
broker
stocks
and
securities,
and
that
isn't
what
it
said.
it
wrote
a
sentence
which...
the
logical
form
of
which
implies
that
the
power
is
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
understand.
what's
an
unauthorized
preexisting
power?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
and
if
all
congress
meant
to
do
was
to
legalize
what
the
comptroller
had
been
doing,
the
sensible
way
to
do
that
would
have
been
to
say,
it
is
lawful
for
banks
to
sell
stocks
and
securities,
but
it
didn't
do
that.
it
wrote
a
sentence
which
seems
to
imply
that
they
had
a
general
power
to
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying
that
in
the
mcfadden
act,
the
text
of
which
is
not
incorporated
here,
there
was
an
affirmative
grant
of
authority
to
sell
stocks
and
bonds?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
can
generalize
with
respect
to
the
extension
of
credit,
why
can't
you
generalize
with
respect
to
the
investment
power,
which
happens
to
be
receiving
deposits?
people
today,
instead
of
just
making
deposits,
want
other
ways
of
making
investments.
if
generalization
is
good
with
respect
to
credit,
why
isn't
generalization
good
with
respect
to
investment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
is
to
say
we
won't
generalize,
but
my
question
is,
why
don't
you
generalize?
