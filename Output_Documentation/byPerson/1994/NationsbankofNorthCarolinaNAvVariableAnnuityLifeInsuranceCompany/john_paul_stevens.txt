the
people
who
die
late
are
subsidized
by
those
who
die
early.

mr.
stewart,
would
a
purchase
by
an
elderly
person
of
a
life
estate
in
a
retirement
home
be
insurance
within
your
definition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
it's
the
same
subsidy.
the
people
who
live
a
short
period
of
time
subsidize
those
who
live
longer.
it's
exactly
the
same
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
the
same
risk,
the
same...
i
don't
understand
the
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
you
do
that
to
much--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you
do
that,
don't
you
fall
into
your
opponent's
argument
that
business
changes
over
the
times,
and
what
might
not
have
been
insurance
50
years
ago
can
be
considered
insurance
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
take
the
position...
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
concept
of
banking
was
frozen
as
of
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
you
disagree
with
justice
scalia's
question,
i
gather.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
it
was
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
maybe
i
didn't
understand
it,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
for
example,
there's
a
power,
loaning
on
personal
security.
does
that
mean
that
the
note...
the
person
who
gets
the
note
must
be
personally
liable
on
every
note
that
the
bank
makes?
for
example,
lending
money
on...
mortgaging
real
property,
or
chattel
mortgages,
all
that...
how
do
you
justify
all
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
extension
of
credit
is
authorized?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
see
that.
where
is
extension
of
credit
authorized?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
of
the
five
powers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
only
loaning
is
by
loaning
money
on
personal
security.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wouldn't...
or...
and
nobody
guarantees
the
note.
it's
just
secured
by
a
piece
of
real
estate.
i
don't
know
how
that
fits
in
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
doesn't
say
so?
