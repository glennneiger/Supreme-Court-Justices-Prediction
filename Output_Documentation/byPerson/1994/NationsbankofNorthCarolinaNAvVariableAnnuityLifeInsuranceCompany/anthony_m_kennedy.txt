justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
a
plausible
argument
to
say
that
an
annuity
can
be
both
insurance
and
a
security,
or
are
these
mutually
exclusive
categories?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
you
had
told
me
that
the
distinction
between
securities
on
the
one
hand
and
insurance
on
the
other
is
not
very
helpful
to
this
case,
yet
i
see
you're
relying
on
that
in
your
answer
to
justice
souter.
