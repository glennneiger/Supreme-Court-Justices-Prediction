mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
by
noting
what
this
case
does
not
involve.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
bank
underwriting
annuities.
this
does
not
involve
a
bank
seeking
to
become
a
general
insurance
agent.
what
it
does
involve
is
nationsbank's
attempt
to
sell
a
specific
financial
investment
product
which
is
currently
being
sold
by
federally
insured
thrift
institutions,
federal
credit
unions,
and
by
respondent's
admission
at
least
a
third,
and
we
believe
two-thirds
of
all
state
banks,
including
the
state
banks
that
nationsbank
competes
with,
which
are--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--our
application,
justice
o'connor,
included
a
request
to
sell
every
modern
form
of
annuities,
and
we
are--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--well,
our
application
included
fixed
and
variable,
every
possible
combination
that's
available
in
the
marketplace,
and
indeed,
we
do
represent
several
different
insurers
and
have
sold
virtually
every
combination
known,
so
you're
talking
about
the
whole
panoply
here.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
i
haven't
looked
as
carefully
as
i
should
have
on
that
issue.
my
understanding
is
that
the
banks
which
sell
annuities
where
states
permit
it,
permit
the
sale
of
the
full
panoply,
and
indeed,
let
me
expand
on
that,
according
to
the
latest
available
statistics
banks,
depository
institutions
in
1993
sold
on
the
order
of
13
and
a
half
billion
dollars
worth
of
annuities,
representing
19.3
percent
of
all
individual
annuity
sales.
those
are
depository
institutions.
it's
a
huge
amount
of
volume,
and
it's
our
belief
that
the
comptroller
is
permitted,
under
the
national
bank
act,
to
at
least
include
that
as
one
of
his
factors
in
determining
what
constitutes
the
business
of
banking.
it's
not--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--no.
we
are
not...
we
are
simply
an
agent.
we
are
a
broker.
the
policy
is
issued
by
hartford
life
insurance,
or
some
company--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--you
will
go
to
an
account
executive
at
the
branch,
you
will
indicate
that
you
are
interested
in
purchasing
annuities,
the
account
executive
will
provide
you
with
material
on
a
wide
variety
of
different
policies,
you
will
look
at
that
material
and
you
will
decide
which
of
the
various
features
you
would
like,
and
then
you
will
write
out
a
check,
not
to
nationsbank,
but
to
the
issuer
for
the
amount
of
the
policy,
and
we
will
handle
the
application
and
arrange
for
the
sale.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
yes,
we
do.
we
do.
the
position
respondents
have...
has
taken
in
its
brief
is
really
that
the
business
of
banking
is
a
concept
which
was
frozen
as
of
1863.
i
mean,
it's
frozen,
i
say
in
my
brief,
like
some
matthew
brady
daguerreotype.
we
don't
believe
that
the
business
of
banking
was
frozen
by
banking
powers
that
existed
at
that
time
and
by
the
same
token
we
don't
believe
it's
infinitely
elastic.
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
grant
the
comptroller
reasoned
discretion,
as
it
does
under
a
variety
of
other
statutes
which
include
similar
language.
this
court
has
had
no
problem--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--i
think...
i
think
this
would
be
a
tougher
case,
justice
o'connor,
if
the
comptroller
had
approved
our
right
to
be
a
general
insurance
agent,
to
sell
auto
insurance,
life
insurance--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--i
do
not
believe,
your
honor,
that
section
92
prohibited
large
banks
from
selling
any
insurance
product.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
from
selling,
justice
o'connor,
any
insurance
policy,
any
insurance
product,
any
product
of
an
insurance
company,
we
do
see
some
negative
implication
in
the
sense
that
if
we
were
here
trying
to
sell
all
insurance
products,
all
products
of
insurance
companies,
we
think
that
that
would
be
a
tougher
case,
but
we
note,
your
honor,
that
at
the
beginning
of
section
92,
congress
express...
congress
expressly
preserved
existing
banking
powers.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
but
there...
i
don't
think
there
is,
justice...
chief
justice.
the
fact
is
that
there
wasn't
a
general
power
to
sell
all
policies.
i
mean,
all
insurance.
all
there
was
under
24(7)
is
the
right
to
engage
in
those
activities
incidental
to
the
business
of
banking.
even
in
1994,
all
that
the
banking
industry
has
contended
is
that
24(7)
allows
the
sale
of
credit
life
insurance,
certain
policies
which
are
related
to
lending
and
annuities,
but
not--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--no,
i'm...
i
thought
what
i
had
answered
was
that
i
think
there
is
a
negative
implication
to
the
extent
that,
if
we
were
here
in
a
case
in
which
we
were
seeking...
a
large
bank,
nationsbank
were
seeking
to
sell
auto
insurance,
life
insurance,
the
full
panoply
of
insurance,
then
i
think
the
argument
about
negative
implication
has
more
weight,
but
we're
not
seeking
that
here.
we're
talking
about
very
specialized
and
particular
products.
if
i
may
turn
it
around,
what
was
the
purpose
of
congress
adding
the
language
at
the
beginning
of
24(7)
if
it
was
not
to
preserve
the
right
to
sell
some
products
under
other
banking
powers,
and
that's
all
we're
talking
about
here,
and
there
are
two
banking
powers
we're
talking
about,
24(7)
and
the
power
to
deal
in
stocks
and
securities,
the
second
sentence
of
24(7).
and
i
would
note
that
we
are
here
urging
both
powers,
because...
and
this
is
a
point
which
may
get
lost
in
the
briefs.
there
are
really
two
lawsuits
here.
there's
a
lawsuit
against
the
comptroller
with
respect
to
the
1990
approval.
there's
also
a
lawsuit
against
nationsbank
to
enjoin
us
from
selling
either
fixed
or
variable
annuities.
when
we
appeared
in
the
district
court,
we
defended
the
right
to
sell
under...
under
the
general
business
of
banking,
but
we
also
defended
on
the
grounds
that
under
previous
rulings
which
were
adopted
in
1990
we
had
the
right
to
sell
variable
annuities
under
the
second
sentence
of
24(7).
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
i
think
that
the
comptroller
had
the
discretion--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--i--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--i
think,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
a
critical
difference,
and
the
critical
difference
is
that
an
insurance
policy,
a
life
insurance
policy
dealt...
deals
with
an
insurable
risk,
the
risk
that
someone
will
die
prematurely.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
no,
it
doesn't.
it
deals
with...
it
deals
with...
it
has
a
mortality
calculation.
i
concede
that
all
of
them
have
mortality
calculations,
but
there
area
lot
of
instruments
and
a
lot
of
entities
which
have
mortality
calculations
which
are
not
insurance.
the
key
is,
and
i
think
the
court
has
said
this,
sharing
of
insurance
risk,
and
i
believe
that
the
authorities
which
we've
cited,
and
there
are
voluminous
academic
authorities,
say
that
annuities
are
not
insurance
because
they
do
not
involve
an
insurance
risk.
only
the
insurance
companies
would
argue
that
living
to
a
ripe
old
age
constitutes
a
risk.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
i
think
pooling...
the
word
pooling
occurs,
but
the
question
is,
was
there
a
pooling
of
insurance
risk,
and
i
think
what
the
comptroller
said
in
his
opinion
and
what
i
think
he
was
reasonable
in
concluding
was
that
annuities
do
not
involve
a
pooling
of
insurance
risk,
and
we've
cited
in
our
briefs,
and
i
think
it's
hard
to
disagree
that
there
are
lots
of
authorities
out
there,
lots
of
academicians,
lots
of
court
cases
which
have
held
that
annuities,
fixed
annuities
do
not
involve
a
pooling
of
insurance
risk.
they
do
involve
mortality
calculations.
we
concede
that,
but
we
don't
think
this
that
that's
the
hallmark.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
risk,
and
that's
the
word
that
has
been
focused
on
in
numerous
decisions
of
this
court,
the
word
risk,
and
really
what
they
mean
is
insurance
risk
in
those
cases.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
thank
you,
sir.
