mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
federal
banking
law
permits
national
banks
to
act
as
agents
in
the
sale
of
annuities.
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
who
has
supervisory
authority
over
the
national
banking
system,
based
his
conclusion
that
it
does
on
three
determinations,
each
grounded
in
his
technical
and
policy
expertise:
first,
that
banks
are
authorized
to
broker
financial
investments
on
behalf
of
their
customers,
second,
that
modern
annuity
contracts
are
essentially
investment
products,
and
third,
that
nothing
in
12
u.s.
code
section
92,
which
authorizes
banks
operating
in
small
towns
to
operate
general
insurance
agencies,
prohibits
sales
of
annuities
by
banks
located
elsewhere.
the
court
of
appeals
erred
by
failing
to
defer
to
the
comptroller
on
each
of
these
judgements.
the
general
banking
power
statute,
12
u.s.
code
section
24
seventh,
provides
at
the
outset
that
national
banks
may
exercise
"all
such
incidental
powers
as
shall
be
necessary
to
carry
on
the
business
of
banking.
"
defining
what
is
part
of
the
business
of
banking
at
any
given
time
requires
an
intimate
understanding
of
a
highly
dynamic
field.
it
is
therefore
a
task
uniquely
within
the
competence
of
the
comptroller.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
the
courts
are
certainly
well
advised
to
look
at
those
things
as
exemplary
of
what
is
encompassed
within
the
business
of
banking,
the
core
business
of
banking.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
think
that
the
language
of
the
first
phrase
there,
24
seventh,
is
broad
enough
to
go
beyond
just
the
listed
powers,
and
the
courts
have
so
held
in
a
variety
of
cases,
including--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i
think
if
you
wanted
to
operate
a
general
insurance
agency
you
would
be
in
the
province
of
section
92,
but
let
me
point
out
that
the
second
sentence
of
section
24
seventh
i
think
is
very
important
here,
if
i
may,
and
the
second
sentence,
which
was
added
in
the
1930's,
says
the
business
of
dealing
in
securities
and
stock
by
the
association
shall
be
limited
to
purchasing
and
selling,
and
so
on.
it
goes
on
to...
it
recognizes
the
existence
of
the
business
of
dealing
in
securities
and
stock,
and
this
court
has
twice
before
recognized
in--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
the
glass-steagall
provision.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
my
point
is
that
the
way
that
that
sentence
is
phrased
indicates
that
it
is
not
granting
a
new
power
but
recognizing
and
limiting
one
that
was
already
granted.
in
fact,
this
court
has
specifically
recognized
that
fact
in
both
clarke
v.
securities
industry
association
and
sia
board
of
governors.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
that
that
would--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
that
sort
of
question
would
be
one
for
the
comptroller
in
the
first
instance
and,
of
course,
is
not
involved
here.
i
think--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
that
if
there
were
a
practice,
as
there
is
in
this
case
over
a
long
period
of
years,
of
banks
dealing
in
that
kind
of
thing
as
agent
for
their
customers
without
substantial
equity
risk,
and
that
that
had
been
recognized
by
the
courts
over
time,
i
think
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
comptroller...
and,
by
the
way,
i
think
i
should
add,
if
other
banks
and
savings
institutions
regulated
by
other
entities,
such
as
state
banks
or
federal
thrifts,
were
engaging
in
the
same
activity,
i
think
it
would
be
reasonable--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
say
that
the
sale
of
investment
products,
the
brokering
of
investment
products
is
something
that
has
been
carried--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
they
are
different
questions.
the
sale
of
investment
products
has
been
carried
out
over
a
long
period
of
time
by
banks,
and
that's--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--annuities
have
been
sold
by
banks
other
than
those
regulated
by
the
comptroller
in
the
last
several
years.
in
fact,
banks
are
quite
a
substantial
part
of
that
business,
other
banks,
and
that's
really
part
of
the
comptroller's
point
here,
is
that
there
are
lots
of
banking
institutions
that
are
conducting
exactly
this
kind
of
agency
sale,
and
there's
no
reason
why
national
banks
should
not
be
allowed
to
encompass
that
within
their
business
of
banking.
but
we're
perfectly
willing
to
address
the
question
of
why
annuities
are
like...
modern
annuities
are
like
investment
products
of
the
kind
that
banks
have
traditionally
brokered.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it
is
not
a
statutory
term.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
think
that
the...
the
statutory
term
is,
the
business
of
banking.
the
question
is,
what
is
fairly
encompassed
within
the
business
of
banking
and
powers
incidental
thereto?
the
comptroller
has
determined
that
the
brokerage
sale
of
investment
products
of
a
variety
of
different
kinds,
whether
or
not
they
are
securities
and
stock
specifically
recognized
by
the
statute--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
believe,
financial
investment
products,
yes,
or
financial
investment
instruments.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
the
discussion
goes
on
to
talk
about
exactly
why
they
are
investment
instruments
in
the
modern
context,
why
annuities
are,
and
i
can
turn
to
that.
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
modern
market,
and
this
is
something
the
comptroller
did,
that
the
essential
feature
of
the
modern
annuity
contract
is
really
a
tax
deferral
feature.
in
the
accumulation
of--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i
think
it's
perfectly
fair
to
look
at
the
text
as
a
good
starting
point
for
what
is
the
business
of
banking,
but
i
think
it
would
be
erroneous
to
take
a
statute
like
this,
that
is
really
an
organic
law
to
govern
the
development...
to
govern
the
existence
of
the
banking
industry
and
to
try
to
freeze
at
any
one
time
exactly
what
banks
are
doing,
and
say,
well,
they
were
doing
that
in
1864,
and
unless
congress
acts
specifically,
they
can
do
no
other
thing
from
now
on.
and
i
would
point
out
that
this
court
has
had
to
address
a
variety
of
issues,
such
as
borrowing
money,
which
are
not
specifically
referred
to
in
section
24
seventh,
and
yet
the
court
has
not
had
a
lot
of
trouble
saying,
well,
look,
we
look
at
a
particular
case
with
particular
facts,
and
this
is
a
power
which
is
necessary
to
carry
on
the
business
of
banking,
and
i
think
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
analysis
we
look
to
here.
now,
there
are
a
variety
of...
the
text
is
the
best
starting
point,
but
also,
i
do
think
that
as
the
business
develops,
and
banks
in
a
variety
of
jurisdiction
start
dealing
with
particular
kinds
of
products
that
one
can
fairly
look
to
that
development,
as
the
court
really
did,
or
as
the
state
and
lower
federal
courts
did,
in
the
case
of
securities
and
stock,
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
part
of
the
business
of
banking
in
the
1860's,
but
certainly
by
the
time
of
the
1930's,
when
glass-steagall
was
passed,
this
court
has
properly
recognized
that
that
was
a
recognized
part
of
what
banks
were
doing.
they
were
brokering
securities
and
stock
for
their
customers.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
to
answer
the
first
question,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
particularly
appropriate
to
consider
that
a
central
purpose
of
92,
to
protect
insurance
agents.
there
is
concern
expressed
in
the
primary
legislative
history,
the
comptroller's
letter
on
the
subject
in
1916,
that
banks
should
not
become
department
stores
and--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
there
was
certainly
recognition
of
that,
but
again,
i
think
you
need
to
look
at
that
in
the
context
of
what
92
was
doing,
which
was
authorizing
a
national
bank
operating
in
a
small
town
to
carry
on
an
entire
general
agency.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
we
really
think
that
section
92
was
limited
to
granting
an
additional
power.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
no.
even
if
we
grant
that
there's
some
preemptive
scope
to
92,
and
that
therefore
there's
a
question
to
be
decided
about
what
was
the
purpose
of
92
and
what
might
be
the
sort
of
insurance
product
that
falls
within
it,
there's
no
indication
that
that
was
meant
to
sweep
away
any
product
that
might
ever
be
sold
by
an
insurance
company,
or
anything
that
might
for
some
purposes
be
denominated
insurance.
and
in
this
context,
we'd
be
perfectly
willing
to
concede,
as
you
say,
that
annuities
might
for
some
purposes
be
classified
as
insurance
and
for
other
purposes
not.
as
long
as
they're
in
that
middle
ground,
it
is...
it
was
perfectly
within
the
comptroller's
province
to
decide--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
certainly.
i
mean,
they...
first
of
all,
the
presumption
was
that
a
bank
in
a
large
city
had
plenty
of
banking
business
and
didn't
need
the
additional
revenue.
that's
the
primary
reason,
and
that's
reflected
in
the
comptroller's
letter,
and
also
that
a
bank
in
a
large
town
that
had
lots
of
banking
business
should
be
concentrating
its
attention
primarily
on
its
banking
business
as
opposed
to
running
a
general
insurance
agency,
whereas
none
of
those
things
applied
in
the
small
town.
incidentally,
he
did
mention
that
they
also
wouldn't
be
taking
business
away
from
insurance
brokers
in
small
towns
because
they
might
not
be
an
insurance
broker
in
such
a
town.
all
of
that
is
fine,
but
i
don't
think
it
gets
away
from
the
central
purpose
of
92
being
to
confer
additional
power
on
banks
and
small
towns
to
allow
them
to
raise
extra
revenue
by
operating
a
general
insurance
agency,
and
really
none
of
those
purposes
was
engaged
here.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
to
begin
with,
it's
importance
to
distinguish...
for
instance,
the
court's
prior
cases
like
bailey,
for
one,
and
united
benefit
life,
looked
in
the
securities
law
context
at
whether
something
was
a
security,
on
one
hand,
or
an
annuity
contract
or
insurance
on
the
other,
and
that
made
sense
in
that
statutory
context
because
the
specific
statutory
exception
was
from
securities
law
for
annuity
contracts
or
insurance
contracts.
we
have
a
very
different
context
here,
which
is
a
statute
which
simply
confers
some
authority
to
deal
in
a
broad
range
of
insurance
products
on
banks
and
small
towns.
there
isn't
anything
to
set
against
insurance
like
securities.
there's
no
other
product
that
you're
really
deciding,
is
it
one
or
the
other.
in
this
case,
it
can
perfectly
well
be
both.
the
question
is,
does
it
fall
within
the
scope
of
insurance
as
that
is
intended
in
section
92?
and
our
answer
to
that
is,
the
comptroller
was
perfectly
within
the
grounds
of
reason
to
conclude
that
no,
because
these
products
in
the
modern
marketplace
were
sufficiently
like
modern,
other
modern
investment
products,
and
sufficiently
unlike
the
broad
range
of
general
insurance
products,
that
he
could
determine
that
they
are
part
of
the
business
of
banking
and--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--not
go
under
section
92.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
think
it
depends
on
what
kind
of
life
insurance
we're
talking
about.
pure
term
insurance,
no,
i
don't
think
you
can
make
the
same--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--there
are
a
variety
of
insurance
products--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--the
insurance
industry
has
shown
itself
to
be
very
inventive
in
operating
in
that
medium
ground
between
pure
investment
and
pure
insurance.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
it
has,
to
the
extent
that
it
has
always
existed,
which--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--the
comptroller
has
made
no
determination
on
that,
but
our
argument
would
be
that
the
comptroller
could
look
at
a
particular
set
of
insurance
products,
including
whole
universal
life
products,
and
decide
that
if
they
have
predominantly...
predominantly
investment
characteristics
they
are
within
the
scope
of
the
banking
powers
and
outside
the
scope
of
section
92.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
know
what
congress
or
the
comptroller
thought
about
life
insurance
and
banks
in
1916,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
really
completely
relevant.
assuming
that
they
thought...
that
they
would
have
been
completely
surprised
at
the
notion
that
a
bank
anywhere
could
have
sold...
without
92
to
could
have
sold
an
insurance
policy
or
an
annuity
that
doesn't
give
any
scope
for
the
development
of
the
business
of
banking
and
the
development
of
the
products.
i
mean,
i
think
if
you
really
looked
at
1916
life
insurance
products
and
annuity
products,
then
and
now,
you'd
find
that
they
are
very
different,
the
market
is
very
different,
the
country
is
very
different,
and
the
business
of
banking
is
very
different.
there's
no
reason
why
one
should
freeze
the
business
of
banking
or
the
concept
of
insurance
for
purposes
of
section
92.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
banking,
of
course,
started
out
as
a
state-regulated
activity,
and
still
very
many
banks,
including
many
very
important
banks,
are
state-regulated,
for
instance
in
new
york,
and
as
you
know,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
recently
said
on
a
case
identical
to
this
that
new
york
banks
are
entitled
to--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--the
latter
part,
i
don't
know,
the
breakdown
between
state
banks
and
national
banks.
i
don't
have
them
at
the
tip
of
my
finger.
there
are
figures
in
our
brief
about
the
percentage.
it's
a
considerable
percentage,
on
the
order
of
20
percent
of
the
modern
annuities
market,
which
is
a
bank
market,
i
believe.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
you
can
certainly
say
that.
annuities
are,
and
always
have
been,
and
are
treated
under
state
insurance
laws,
for
that
matter,
as
separate
products
from
other
kinds
of
insur...
from
insurance
at
all,
and--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
variable
annuities
i
should
say
have
been
held
by
this
court
in
the
securities
context
to
be
securities,
and
therefore
they're
clearly
covered
by
the
second
sentence
of
24
seventh,
and
there
really
shouldn't
be
any
issue--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--the
fixed
annuities
are
a
more
difficult
case,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
no,
no,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
the
securities
context...
and
we
agree
that
they're
not
the
same
context.
they're
not
necessarily
the
same
context,
but
both
the
comptroller
and
the
sec
and
this
court
have,
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
both
securities
and
banking,
recognized
that
variable
annuities
are
essentially
mutual
fund
products.
they
are
investment
products,
and
they
are
securities.
they
are
regulated
like
securities,
and
they
are
sold
like
securities,
so
in
that
sense
they're
clearly
covered
by
the
second
sentence
of
section
24
seventh.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
don't
know
that
the
comptroller
has
a
taken
a
particular
position
on--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--the
basic
theory
is
really
two
things:
one
is,
you
look
to
the
kinds
of
things
that
are
listed,
and
to
things
that
might
be
either
convenient
or
useful
to
carrying
out
those
listed
powers,
or
a
reasonable
extrapolation
from
them,
and
the
second
is
that
you
look
at
banking
practices
as
they
