justice
sandra

o'connor
well,
mr.
dumont,
you
rely
on
the
language
in
the
seventh
section
there
of
the
business
of
banking.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
phrase
is
followed
by
a
listing
of
six
specific
things
that
banks
can
do,
and
it's
been
my
understanding
that
most
courts
have
defined
the
business
of
banking
in
terms
of
those
specifically
enumerated
powers
rather
than
something
more
broad.
should
we
not
look
to
the
six
specific
things
and
see
if
something
is
closely
related
to
those?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
think
any
investment
instrument
of
financial
investment
interest
is
within
the
business
of
banking
even
though
it's
not
mentioned
in
any
of
the
six
listed
things?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
including
the
selling
of
insurance
policies
of
any
kind.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean
the
glass-steagall--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
add
it
unless
the
sale
of
securities
and
stock
had
been
covered,
is
your
point.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
a
bank
have
power
to
deal
in
expensive
art
for
investment
purposes?
some
people
use
art
as
an
investment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
within
their
powers,
too?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
language
would
stretch
that
far?
would
that
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
by
the
comptroller
to
which
we
should
defer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
say
that
the
sale
of
annuities
is
something
that
has
been
carried
out
over
a
long
period
of
time
by
national
banks?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
annuities.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
annuities?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
include
all
types
of
annuities,
fixed,
variable,
and
those
in
between?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
including
fixed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
isn't
there
some
negative
implication
from
section
92
that
large
banks
can't
sell
insurance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
my
question
is
this:
is
there
some
negative
implication,
from
the
language
of
section
92,
that
suggests
that
large
banks
may
not
sell
insurance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
see
no
negative
implications?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
isn't
the
sale
of
a
fixed
annuity
very
much
like
the
sale
of
a
life
insurance
policy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't...
try
to
focus
on
my
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
a
fixed
annuity
does
exactly
the
same
thing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
were
variable
annuities
sold
at
the
time
these
laws
were
passed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
were
not
sold
then.
it
tended
to
be--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so
as
to
the
variables,
do
you
think
that
falls
within
the
enumerated
powers
of
banking
under
the
seventh
section,
to
the
extent
they're
securities?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
curious,
though,
inasmuch
as
this
court
has
said
those
instruments
are
securities,
whether
it
wouldn't
fall
squarely
within
that
provision.
