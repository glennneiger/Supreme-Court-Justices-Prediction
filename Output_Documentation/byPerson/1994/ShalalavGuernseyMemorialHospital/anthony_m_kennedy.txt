well,
is
your
case
weaker
or
stronger
without
the
manual?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
begins
with
a
rather
splendid
accounting
problem.
it
arises
from
a
dispute
between
a
hospital
which
is
medicare
provider
and
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services.
the
hospital
is
the
guernsey
memorial
hospital
in
cambridge,
ohio.
like
many
borrowers,
when
interest
rates
change,
the
guernsey
memorial
hospital
decided
that
it
would
refinance
bonds
that
it
had
issued
and
so
they
retired
the
old
bonds
and
purchased
new
ones.
now,
this
gave
it
an
accounting
loss
for
the
first
year,
or
a
group
of
years
and
that's
the
question
before
us.
the
accounting
loss
was
for
the
refinancing
cost
of
the
bonds.
everyone
agrees
that
the
loss
is
reimbursable
as
the
medicare
covered
loss
to
the
extent
that
the
hospital
participates
in
the
medicare.
the
argument
is
about
whether
the
entire
loss
must
be
reimbursed
upfront,
which
is
what
the
hospital
wants
or
whether
it
must
be
threaded
with
the
life
of
the
old
bonds
which
is
what
the
secretary
contends
for.
now,
the
accounting
dispute
intern
involves
a
more
significant
legal
question.
it
is
whether
the
secretary’s
regulations
resolved
the
issue
by
requiring
reimbursement
and
in
accordance
with
generally
accept
with
accounting
principles
or
whether
the
secretary
is
free
to
promulgate
policy
guidelines
that
depart
from
those
principles.
now,
we
agree
with
the
secretary,
that
the
regulations
do
not
require
reimbursement
according
to
the
generally
accepted
accounting
principles,
nor
must
the
regulations
resolved
every
accounting
issue
in
precise
detail.
the
guideline
announced
by
the
secretary
is
valid
and
controls
the
adjudication
of
procedures
followed
to
resolve
these
cost
disputes.
the
policy
of
the
secretary
requiring
that
the
cost
be
spread
on
over
a
period
of
years
is
a
reasonable
implementation
of
the
secretary’s
duty
to
avoid
distortions
in
the
reimbursement
process.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reach
the
opposite
conclusion.
so,
its
judgment
must
be
reversed.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
joined
by
justices
scalia,
souter
and
thomas.
