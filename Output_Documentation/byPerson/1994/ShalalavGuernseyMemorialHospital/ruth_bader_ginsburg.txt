mr.
jones,
if
you
could
give
an
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
did
the
reporter
report
accurately,
that
would
be
helpful.
i
think
it
was
clear
up
until
your
brief
in
this
case
that
you
conceded
that
the
hospital's
report
form
was
okay.
it
was
a
proper
report.
i
couldn't
tell
for
sure
whether
you
were
continuing
to
make
that
concession
in
your
brief
here.
did
the
hospital
report
properly?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just...
did
the
hospital
report
properly?
you
seem
to
be
saying,
the
reimbursement
doesn't
have
to
match
the
report,
but
the
hospital
asked
the
question,
we
have
to
fill
out
this
form
and
claim
our
costs.
was
that
cost
report
proper
in
compliance
with
the
statute
and
regulations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
the
hospital
filed,
should
the
hospital,
instead
of
taking
this
all
at
once
have
split
it
up,
have
amortized
it,
as
you
did
in
your
reimbursement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
other
indications,
other
illustrations,
apart
from
this
one,
where
the
report
from
the
hospital
is
correct,
it's
a
proper
report,
it
reports
the
cost--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--which
is
reasonable,
a
reasonable
cost,
so
the
debate
is,
as
here,
not
whether
you
can
take
this
cost,
but
when?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
you
correctly--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
there's
no
debate
between
the
two
sides
that
this
is
a
reasonable
choice
for
her
to
make,
and
she
could
have
made
it
in
a
regulation,
the
only
question
is,
must
she
do
it
in
the
regulation
and
not
stick
it
in
the
prm?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
you
reported
in
your
brief
that
in
fact,
before
you
put
this
in
the
prm,
there
was
extensive
consultation,
prior
consultation.
if
you
were
engaging
in
that,
why
didn't
you
just
have
it
done
by
notice
and
comment
rulemaking?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
taebel,
let
me
ask
you
to
respond
to
the
question
that
was
raised
about
this
prm
being
hundreds
of
pages,
and
if
the
secretary
had
to
do
all
of
the
fine
things
that
she's
done
in
the
prm
by
regulation
we
would
have
regulations
of
monstrous
size,
and
she
would
be
bogged
down
all
the
time,
having
a
manual
that
gets
changed
monthly,
maybe
even
weekly,
having
to
go
through
notice
and
comment
for
every...
what
is
in
that
big,
fat
manual
that
doesn't
have
to
go
through
notice
and
comment,
and
what
would
have,
under
your
fix
on
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
any
notion
about
how
many
items
in
this
manual
are
inconsistent
with
gaap?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
she
get
out
of
it
by
changing
413.20,
by
not
saying
that
the
standardized
whatever,
that
gaap
is
the
rule
unless
there's
a
regulation
to
the
contrary?
could
she
change
413
to
have
something
other
than
gaap
apply
to
what
has
to
be
reported?
