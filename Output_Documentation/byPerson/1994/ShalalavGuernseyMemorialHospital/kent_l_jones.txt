mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
medicare
act
and
section
413.9
of
its
implementing
regulations,
the
united
states
reimburses
the
reasonable
cost
of
services
provided
to
medicare
beneficiaries.
the
secretary
of
hhs
makes
the
reimbursement
determinations
under
the
act
subject
to
judicial
review
under
the
apa.
this
case
concerns
whether,
in
making
these
determinations,
the
secretary
is
required
by
her
regulations
to
apply
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
even
when
she
rationally
determines
in
a
particular
case
that
application
of
those
principles
will
not
arrive
at
the
reasonable
cost
for
the
services
provided
during
the
reimbursement
period.
in
our
view,
the
language
of
the
regulations
contains
no
such
requirement.
section
413.20
of
the
regulations,
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied,
specifies
that
providers
are
to
maintain
their
cost
records
by
use
of
standardized
definitions
and
accounting
procedures
and
practices,
and
states,
and
i
quote,
"that
essentially
reimbursement
under
the
act
involves
making
use
of
that
cost
data
to
arrive
at
equitable
and
proper
payment.
"
while
nothing
in
these
general
admonitions
about
maintaining
and
using
cost
data
to
arrive
at
equitable
and
proper
payment
represents
a
clear,
unambiguous
and
firm
undertaking
by
the
secretary
that
she
will
always
apply
gaap
in
reimbursement
determinations.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
to
maintain
their
costs.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
section
413.9
of
the
regulation
is
the
substantive
standard
that
provides
that
all
payments
will
be
made
with
respect
to
reasonable
costs.
that's
the
substantive
standard.
section
413.20--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
we--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
the
easiest
way
for
me
to
explain
that
is
to
point
out
that,
even
if
a
provider
follows
a
particular
format
in
submitting
the
costs,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
costs
thus
submitted
are
reasonable
costs
to
be
reimbursed
under
medicare.
for
example,
under
accrual
accounting,
which
is
what
the
regulation
talks
about,
or
even
under
gaap,
a
hospital
with
gold
plumbing
could
arrive
at
a
valid
accounting
statement
for
its
actual
depreciation
costs.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
as
the
administrator
pointed
out
in
this
case,
the
timing,
the
coordination
of
the
timing
of
the
cost
with
the
periods
benefited
by
that
cost
is
as
important
in
the
determination
of
reasonable
cost
as
the
amount
of
the
cost.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
there's...
there
are
several
points
involved
in
your
question,
and
let
me
see
if
i
can
address
them.
the
first
point
is
whether
these
regs
require
that
we
imply...
employ
gaap,
and
our
point
is,
the
text
of
the
regulations
doesn't
require
it,
and
it
would
be
illogical
for
any
such
requirement
to
exist,
because
gaap
has
only
a
remote
relationship
to
whether
costs
are
reasonable.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
hospital
reported
its
expenses
in
a
proper
amount,
and
by
interpretation
of
the
agency's
regulations,
what
the
hospital
is
required
to
do
is
to
apply
the
accrual
basis
of
accounting,
and
it
applied
an
accrual
basis
of
accounting.
the
question
is,
having
met
the
format
requirement
of
the
reimbursement
requirement,
whether
the
costs
thus
reported
are
reasonable
with
respect
to
the
services
provided
during
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
was
proper
as
to
amount
and
not
as
to
the
timing
of
the
attribution
of
the
costs
to
the
periods
benefited
by
the
expense.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that
is...
maybe
i'm
misunderstanding
your
question
about
what
is
a
cost
report.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
if
they
had
followed
prm
233,
that
is
the
way
they
would
have
submitted
their
cost
report.
it
makes
little
sense
for
the
secretary
to
require
its
intermediaries
to
recast
these
expenses
when
they're
submitted
in
a
manner
that
doesn't
correspond
to
the
secretary's
reimbursement
rules.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
they
did
follow,
and
did
file--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--based
upon
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
for
this
type
of
transaction.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
will
concede
it
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
that
we
don't
have
a
problem
with
providers
estimating
their
costs
in
an
accurate
manner,
which
they
did,
and
submitting
them
to
us
for
us
to
make
a
determination
of
what
reasonable
cost
is.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
don't
want
to
quibble,
but
on
the
other
hand,
this
is
our
regulation,
and
we're
entitled
to
interpret
it,
and
all
that
that
regulation--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is
easy
to
gloss
over
the
specific
words
of
these
regs,
and
i
certainly
don't
want
to
do
that,
but
i
think
that
it's
also
important
to
realize
that
the
statute
and
the
reg
413.9
are
the
substantive
standard.
congress
adopted
reasonable
cost
as
the
substantive
standard.
we
couldn't
alter
that
standard
if
we
wanted
to,
and
we
don't
want
to.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
only
detail
referred
to
in
413.20
is
advice
that
you
should
use
standard
definitions
in
accounting
practices.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
the
detail
on
which
this
case
turns
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--is
whether
these
costs
are--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
detail
that
should
answer
this
case
is
whether
these
are
reasonable
costs.
all
that
the
regs
that
have
been
relied
on
by
the
courts
below
refer
to
is
how
you
are
to
prepare
and
maintain
and
submit
your
cost
data.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
see
all
of
the
detail
in
413.20
and
24
that
you're
referring
to.
let
me
explain--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--not
by
words,
and
not
by
interpretation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
i
don't
concede
that,
justice
souter.
the
statute...
the
reg
413.24
refers
to
submitting
your
cost
data
on
the
accrual
basis
of
accounting.
it
defines
that
term
in
the
reg
simply
in
a
manner
that
differentiates
that
from
cash
basis
accounting.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
now,
the
decisions
of
the
accounts
principles
board
are
quite
clear
that
gaap
is
just
a
subset
and
not
an
exhaustive
list
of
all
accrual
accounting
methodologies,
and
it's
with
that
thought
in
mind
that
i
think
the
court
should
consider
the
consistent
interpretation
of
the
secretary
since
these
regs
were
adopted
over
20
years
ago.
her--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
see
it
in
the
text,
and
more
importantly--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
certainly--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
says
standard
accounting
practices.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
actually,
you're...
that's
the
statute.
the
statute
makes
a
reference
to--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--considering,
among
other
things,
the
reimbursement
criteria
of
national
organizations.
the
reg
that
you're
talking
about
just
says,
maintain
your
cost
data
so
we
can
audit
it,
and
we
want
you
to
maintain
it
by
reference
to
standard
definitions
and
accounting
practices,
and
then
the
last
sentence
explains
the
context
that
i'm
trying
to
inarticulately
establish,
and
that's,
last
sentence
says,
essentially
reimbursement
under
the
act
involves
making
use
of
this
data
to
arrive
at
equitable
and
proper
payment.
now,
i
understand
essentially
means
mainly
involve,
making
use
of
means
we're
going
to
do
something
to
the
data
that
you've
given
us
to
arrive
at
something
else,
and
that
something
else
is
equitable
and
proper
payment,
and
to
know
what
that
means
we
go
to
the
statute
and
413.9,
which
says
reasonable
cost.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
justice
scalia,
the
statute
doesn't
say
the
secretary
shall
issue
regs,
it
says,
reasonable
costs
shall
be
determined
in
accordance
with
the
regs.
these
reasonable
cost
cases--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--regulations
adopted
by
the
secretary.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
for
the
last
20-some
years
the
secretary,
as
in
this
case,
has
been
making
determinations
as
to
reimbursable
costs
under
section
413.9,
which
is
the
requirement
that
payment
shall
be
made
of
reasonable
costs.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
yes,
there's
a
very
good
example
that
i'd
like
to
describe
in
some
detail
for
you.
it
came
out
of
the
research
medical
center
case
in
the
eighth
circuit,
and
what
the
court
held...
what
that
was
about
was
where,
in
preconstruction
of
a
facility,
interest
was
accruing
on
a
debt.
it
was
reasonable
interest.
it
was
reasonably
related
to
the
construction
of
this
facility.
what
the
secretary
determined
in
a
prm
was
that
this
type
of
preconstruction
interest
should
not
be
paid
by
medicare,
it
should
be
capitalized
until
the
building
is
finished,
and
then
it
should
be
reimbursed
over
an
amortized
period
while
the
building's
being
used.
now,
the
reason
that
she
did
it
that
way
was
because
it
is
extremely
important
in
medicare
to
align
the
costs
incurred
over
the
periods
benefited
by
this
cost,
precisely
because
the
hospital's
level
of
reimbursement,
the
percentage
of
its
costs
that
are
repaid,
fluctuates
depending
upon
the
level
of
service.
and
in
the
research
medical
center
case,
the
court
gave
the
example
of
a
cost
incurred
by
a
hospital
in
year
1
that
provides
benefits
for
10
years,
and
the
court
said
that
if
the
medicare
payment,
if
medicare
paid
that
whole
cost
in
year
1,
and
then
the
hospital
stopped
covering
medicare
patients
in
years
2
and
thereafter,
the
result
would
be
medicare
fully
paid
for
costs
that
benefited
non-medicare
patients
in
other
years.
that
result
would
precisely
contradict
the
statutory
cross-subsidization
rule,
which
is
that
medicare
funds
shall
not
be
used
to
provide
benefits
for
non-medicare
patients.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no
one
has
doubted
that
this
particular
application
of
the
amortization
principle
in
this
case
is
a
rational
application.
what
you
seem
to
be
referring
to,
justice
scalia,
is
the
question
of
whether
the
only
way
the
secretary
could
adopt
a
reasonable
rule--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
when
gaap
adopted
a
different
rule,
4
of
the
18
members
of
the
board
didn't
like
it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--said,
let's
stay
with
the
old
method.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
and
there's
two
aspects
to
that
question.
the
first
is
whether
she
has
to
do
it
in
a
regulation
because
her
regs
require
gaap,
which
i
don't
think
they
do.
they
don't
plausibly
do
that
by
their
terms,
or
by
interpretation.
the
only
other
way
that
she
could
be
required
to
adopt
this
by
regulation
would
be
if
some
statute
compelled
that
requirement.
the
only
statute
is
the
one
justice
scalia...
that's
applicable
is
the
one
justice
scalia
referred
to,
which
says
reimbursement
shall
be
determined
in
accordance
with
the
regs
establishing
methods.
she
has
such
regs.
the
question
is
whether
she
has
to
adopt
every
detailed
subconcept
as
a
regulation,
and
this
court
has
never
held
any
agency
to
that
requirement.
the
sec--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
this
is
a
form
of
interest
expense
issue,
but
most
of
the
other
subregs
refer
to...
for
example,
in
the
capital
expense
area...
say
reimbursement
is
limited
to
the
following
types
of
costs,
and
then
talk
about
those
costs,
types
of
capital
costs,
but
the
substantive
ceiling
on
these
types
of
capital
costs
is
in
413.9,
which
is
the
reasonable
cost
limit.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
it's
an...
i
think
the
administrator
was
quite
clear
that
it
was
an
interpretation
of
413.9,
and
we
agree
with
that.
moreover,
i
would
direct
the
court--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i
suppose
every
reasonable
expense
would
be
probably
an
expense...
i'm
not
sure.
my
guess
is
that
every
type
of
expense
is
addressed
somewhere
in
the
manual,
but
all
of
those
descriptive
provisions...
i
mean,
in
the
regulations,
but
all
of
those
other
descriptive
provisions
are
subject
to
413.9,
which
is
what
the
administrator
relied
on
here.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
i...
if
i
said
that,
i
didn't
mean
that.
what
i
mean
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--okay,
exactly
what
justice
stevens
was
talking
about.
there
are
other
provisions,
including
the
accounting
provisions--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
in
regulations,
that
set
out
the
methods
by
which
costs
should
be
submitted,
the
types
of--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--costs...
again,
as
justice
stevens
referred
to,
42
c.f.r.
413.153
sets
out
limits
on
the
capital,
the
types
of
capital
costs
that
may
be
reimbursed,
but
the
bottom
line
substantive
answer
to
your
question
that
the
secretary
has
relied
on
for
over
20
years
is
that
her
authority
is
by
statute
and
regulation
to
make
determinations
of
reasonable
costs,
and
that
that
is
the
manner
in
which
these
determinations
are
made.
now,
under
nlrb
v.
bell
aerospace,
this
court
has
acknowledged
that
it's
up
to
the
agency
to
decide
whether
to
proceed
by
adjudication
or
by
regulation,
and
in
this
case
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
think
this
statute
requires
the
agency
to
act
by
regulation.
it
says,
reasonable
costs
shall
be
determined
in
accordance
with
regulations.
it
doesn't
say
that
every
minute
substandard
as
to
what's
a
reasonable
cost
must
be
set
forth
in
a
substantive
rule.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
of
course,
i
haven't
talked
to
those
people,
and
so
i
would
be
hypothesizing,
but
i
can
tell
you
from
representing
government
agencies
there's
always
a
tension,
if
not
a
risk,
involved
in
making
a
concrete,
substantive
rule
that's
binding
that
reduces
the
flexibility.
you
come
up
with
the
rule
that
you
say,
if
a,
b,
and
c
happen,
then
you
won't
get
reimbursement,
and
the
hospitals
then
say,
well,
a
and
b
happened,
but
we
did
d
instead
of
c.
i'm
not
saying
that...
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is,
it's
somewhat
like
in
this
court
sometimes
when
you
want
to
see
an
issue
percolate
in
the
court
of
appeals
some
more
before
you
adopt
a
substantive
decision.
the
agency
wants
to
retain
its
flexibility
before
it
makes
sure,
and
sometimes
it
does
when
it,
after
sufficient
experience,
issues
substantive
rules.
what
the
agency...
the
cost
the
agency
pays
for
not
issuing
the
substantive
rule
is
that
it
has
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case.
it
has
to
defend
its
determination
on
the
facts.
it
has
to
show
that
it
wasn't
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
think
our
case
depends
on
the
manual.
i
think
what
the
man...
what...
the
relevance
of
the
manual
to
this
case
is,
it
shows
that
the
hospital
had
advance
notice,
it
shows
that
we're
behaving
in
a
consistent
fashion,
and
it
provides
some
additional
credibility
to
the
administrator's
finding,
but
it's
the
administrator's
findings
that
the
court
needs
to
look
to
to
decide
whether
this
is
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
it's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
not
suggesting--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
we
don't
have
to
issue
regulations.
we
have
issued
regulations.
that's
really
not
the
question
that
you
have
to
consider.
the
question
is
whether,
in
articulating
substantive
standards
under
the
reasonable

we
have
to
issue
minute

in
as
detailed
an
issue
as
this
one,
advance
refunding
on
indebtedness.
i

the

manual

inches
thick.
these...
this
is
not--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
there's
no
sub...
unless
you
interpret
the
substantive
regulation
in
a
way
that
requires
gaap
to
be
applied,
whether
it
results
in
reasonable
costs
or
not,
whether
it
results
in
reasonable
timing
or
not,
and
unless
you're
willing
to
ignore
the
consistent
interpretation
of
the
secretary
for
20
years
to
the
contrary,
that
question
isn't
presented.
under
this
court's
decision
as
recently
as
last
year
in
thomas
jefferson
university,
the
secretary's
consistent,
rational,
and
contemporaneous
interpretation
of
her
regulations
is
entitled
to
controlling
weight,
and
since
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
agreed
that
it
was
not
arbitrary
or
capricious
to
require
amortization
in
this
context,
and
because
the
regs
don't,
by
their
terms,
require
an
unthinking
application
of
gaap
in
every
situation,
under
the
apa
the
court's...
i'm
sorry,
the
secretary's
decision
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--what's
different
is
that
what
they
did
was,
in
this
kind
of
transaction
the
logic
is
very
simple.
you
incur
some
costs
today
to
save
more
costs
tomorrow.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you...
the
secretary
has
reasonably
concluded
that
it
more
accurately
coordinates
the
extended
benefit
of
this
transaction
with
the
costs
incurred
to
affect
it
to
amortize
those
costs--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--over
a
future
period.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
does
in
this--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--my
first
point
is...
and
time's
running
short...
that
simply
all
you
have
to
decide
is
whether
there's
a
rational
basis
for
the
secretary
to
have
had
a
different
view,
and
both
the
courts
below
agreed
that
there
was.
more
importantly,
in
my
view,
these
interest
costs
of
these
bonds
that
are
going
to
be
extinguished
continue
to
accrue
as
an
economic
fact
until
they
are
in
fact
extinguished,
which
in
this
case
doesn't
happen
for
7
years,
and
so
what
the
secretary...
i'm
sorry,
what
the
hospital
has
attempted
to
do
is
prepay
the
economic
costs
of
the
old
bonds,
even
though
they
remain
in
existence,
and
what
the
secretary
has
concluded
is
that
amortizing
those
prepayments
over
the
remaining
periods
more
accurately
coordinates
the
real
benefits
of
this
transaction
with
the
costs
incurred.
i'd
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you.
there
are
two
questions
of
interpretation.
the
first
is
whether
the
secretary
is
required
by
her
regulations
to
apply
gaap
in
reimbursement
determinations.
her
consistent
and
contemporaneous
interpretation
of
the
regs
has
been
that
it
does
not.
that
interpretation
has
been
set
out
in
the
manual,
which
makes
quite
clear
that
gaap
applies
only
if
there
is
no
other
applicable
manual
provision.
it's
been
made
clear
in
her
litigation
over
the
last
15
years
on
this
subject,
and
her
rational
and
contemporaneous,
consistent
interpretation
should
be
given
controlling
weight
in
understanding
her
own
regulation.
now,
the
other
question
of
interpretation
is
whether
the
amortization
of
these
types
of
advance
refunding
costs
are
rationally
to
be
related
to
the
periods
over
which
they
benefit
the
hospital
by
reducing
its
costs.
for
the
reasons
that
we've
explained,
it
seems
eminently
rational.
the
courts
below
agreed
with
that.
and
not
to
quibble,
but
there
were
three
dissents
to
the
gaap
opinion,
but
one
of
the
part...
one
of
the
members
of
that
opinion
who
assented
to
the
opinion
also
believed
that
amortization
would
have
been
proper.
this
is
an
issue
on
which
accrual
accounting
could
reach
different
conclusions,
and
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
secretary
as
to
that
substantive
question
was
not
unreasonable
or
arbitrary,
and
i
should
point
out
that
in
thomas
jefferson
university,
when
the
court
emphasized
the
deference
which
the
secretary's
decision
should
be
given...
the
court
emphasized
that
these
kinds
of
determinations
involve
the
application
of
policy
judgments
to
the
facts
of
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--thank
you.
