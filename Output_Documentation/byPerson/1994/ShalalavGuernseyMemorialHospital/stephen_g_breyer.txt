stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you,
what
is
special
about
this
reg?
that
is,
what
is
special
about
233?
that
is,
if
i
read
the
thing
to
say,
okay,
normally
apply
gaap,
not
always,
we
have
some
discretion
there.
well,
okay,
going
along
with
you
that
far,
what's
special
about
this
one?
i
mean,
if
in
fact--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
bought
all
their
medicine
in
this
year
and
wrote...
and
didn't
write
the
check
till
next
year,
they'd
accrue
the
expense
this
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
different
about
setting
up
a
trust
fund
which
is
irrevocable
to
pay
back
the
premiums
on
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
the
reg
is,
reading
it
back,
that
you
pay
it
back
amortizing
it
over
the
difference
between
the
time
that
you
issue
the
refunding
bonds
and
the
time
that
the
holders
of
the
refunded
bonds
get
their
principal
back,
which
could
be
next
year,
it
could
be
next
month.
it
bears
no
particular
relationship
to
the
period
of
time
over
which
the
interest
will
be
payable
on
the
refunding
bond--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
it
doesn't
correlate
with
the
medical
costs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
plain
language
says...
it
says
that
they
are
followed.
it
says
they
are
followed,
but
the
language
has
to
do
with
reporting,
so
you'd
have
to
imply
that
the
substantive
reimbursement
also
follows
it,
which
is
not
what
it
says,
but
maybe
it's
a
fair
implication.
but
if
it's
a
fair
implication,
i
take
it
it
would
be
normally.
normally.
so
what's
wrong
with
their
argument
that
this
is
unusual,
the
accounting
profession
has
danced
around
on
this
all
the
time,
they've
come
up
both
ways,
this
is
unusual,
and
that's
why
we
went
the
other
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
calls
for
it
on
reporting.
it
doesn't
call
for
it
on
reimbursement
unless
you
imply
that,
i
take
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
doesn't
she
get
some
leeway
interpreting
her
own
regulation,
which
is
hers,
in
a
way
that
would
be
fair,
that
would
allow
the
whole
thing
to
function
well,
with
248
million
different
items
of
reimbursement,
which
i
take
it
she
couldn't
take
10
years
to
put
in
regs?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then,
if
i
understand
this,
it's
rather
like
a
hospital
that
would
say...
suppose
you
could
set
up
an
irrevocable
trust
with
$1
million
in
it
to
prepay
meals
over
the
next
10
years...
it
might
be
rational
to
say
you
incurred
the
expense
in
year
1.
that's
what
you'd
like
to
say.
it
might
also
be
rational
to
accrue
it
as
the
transaction,
namely
the
meals
are
delivered,
in
which
case
you'd
have
to
amortize
it.
i
take
it
this
is
a
little
bit
like
that.
it's
rational
to
say
you
incurred
the
whole
prepayment
expense
when
you
put
it
in
the
trust,
or
it's
rational
to
say
the
expense
was
incurred
as
the
trust
paid
out
the
prepaid
interest
to
the
original
bondholders
with
their
principal.
is
that
right?
i'm
asking
you
to
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
