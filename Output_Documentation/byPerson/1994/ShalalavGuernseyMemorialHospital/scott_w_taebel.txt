mr.
scott
w.
taebel
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
one
of
timing.
that
is,
under
the
plain
language
of
the
general
medicare
reimbursement
regulations,
the
secretary
can
put
off
payment
for
this
admittedly
reimbursable
loss.
eight
federal
courts,
including
two
circuits,
have
addressed
this
precise
question,
and
they
have
all
answered
it
in
the
negative.
if
the
secretary
wants
to
amend
or
supplement
her
existing
reimbursement
regulations,
she
must
do
so
through
the
promulgation
of
another
regulation.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
justice
scalia
was
indicating,
the
secretary
has
an
obligation
under
the
statute
to
promulgate
her
methods
of
reimbursement.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
if
she
did
not
do
that,
your
honor,
and
she
initially
determined
that
these
costs
should
be
amortized,
then
perhaps
she
could
do
that.
however,
in
this
case
we
have
a
sharp
contrast
between
her
positions
taken
with
respect
to
advance
for
funding
losses.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
no,
your
honor.
she
has
already
issued
a
regulation.
she's
issued
a
regulation
calling
for
the
gaap
approach.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
that
is
regulation,
it's
currently
codified
at
section
413.20,
and
it
indicates,
your
honor--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--with
due
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
all
it
can
call
for.
there
can
be
no
more
standardized
accounting
practices
widely
accepted
in
the
hospital
and
related
fields
than
gaap.
in
fact,
we
count
seven
times
in
the
government's
appellee's
brief
before
the
sixth
circuit
where
they
agreed
that
that
statute
referred
to
gaap.
there
is
no
issue
with
respect
to
that.
under
gaap,
if
a
cost
was--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
the--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--the
regulation.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
yes.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
yes.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
yes,
your
honor,
because
gaap
by
definition
is
the
most
standardized
accounting
practice,
widely
accepted,
that
there
is.
there
really
is
no
issue
with
respect
to
that,
or
there
had
not
been
until
the
briefs
before
this
court.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
your
honor,
there
was
no
gaap
pronouncement
prior
to
1972.
that's
exactly
why
apb
opinion
number
26
came
out
to
clarify
different
treatments
of
this
particular
type
of
cost.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
yes.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
your
honor,
the
regulation
does
not
refer
to
gaap
as
it
existed
in
1966.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
that
is
true,
your
honor.
however,
this
has
been
the
law,
as
it
were,
for
the
accounting
profession
since
1972.
if
the
secretary
wants
to
change
her
general--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--no,
your
honor,
we
are
not
claiming
that
gaap
can
turn
an
otherwise
unallowable
cost
into
a
cost
related
to
patient
care.
that
is
not
the--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
well,
because
i
believe
justice
stevens
was
referring
to
the
gaap
pronouncement
prior
to
1972,
and
there
had
been
no
official--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
i
agree
with
that,
justice--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--scalia,
because--
[laughter]
i
appreciate
the
assistance,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
your
honor,
the
government
does
complain
that
they
will
have
to
promulgate
regulations
for
every
cost
item.
we
don't
think
that
that's
the
case.
most
cost
items,
as
we've
been
indicating
here,
are
recognized
consistent
with
gaap.
when
she
wants
to
promulgate,
or
she
wants
to
use
a
different
method
that
deviates
from
the
gaap
approach,
that's
when
she
has
to
go
forward
with
apa
rulemaking.
she
did
not
do
that
here.
her
method
is
plainly
inconsistent
with
the
prescribed
gaap
approach.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
i
do
know,
your
honor,
that
based
on
other
court
decisions,
the
secretary
has
sought
to
promulgate
by
regulation
several
of
her
manual
provisions.
that's
discussed
in
the
amicus
brief.
it's
a
1991
notice
in
the
federal
register.
she
has
the
ability
to
do
that,
but
bear
in
mind,
please,
that
most
costs
are
reported
and
paid
consistent
with
generally
accepted
accounting
principles.
that's
exactly
why
the
program
utilizes
gaap.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
that's
what
the
regulation
says,
your
honor.
she
has
to
follow
gaap--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--her
regulations
control
over
the
manual
provision,
your
honor.
she
has
adopted
gaap--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--actually,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
her
method
is
not
even
consistent
with
one
of
the
gaap
methods.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
once
she's
adopted
gaap,
if
gaap
changes
she
would
have
to
change
her
regulation.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
it
refers
to,
again,
standardized
definitions,
accounting
statistics,
and
reporting
practices--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--yes,
and
it
also
indicates,
your
honor,
that
changes
in
those
methods
will
not
be
required
in
order
to
determine
costs
payable
under
the
medicare
program.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
well,
i
think
in
this
case,
your
honor,
we
rely
on
gaap
to
report
our
costs,
and
we
claim
that
when
a
cost
is
incurred,
according
to
gaap,
it
then
must
be
payable
under
the
medicare
program.
we
think
that's
the
nexus
that
the
sixth
circuit
found
here
in
the
regulatory
language.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
but
the
regulatory
provision
you're
citing,
justice
scalia,
continues,
and
it
says,
to
determine
costs
payable
under
the
program.
that
is,
if
a--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--because
in
this
case,
your
honor,
there's
no
disagreement
that
this
particular
loss
is
a
reimbursable
cost.
the
only
question
we
need
to
answer
now
is
when
is
that
cost
payable,
and
this
language
here,
which
is
the
general
rule,
indicates
that
it's
payable
when
it's
incurred,
basically,
and
under
gaap,
it's
incurred
in
1985,
the
year
of
the
refinancing.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
the
problem
with
that,
though,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
she
has
to
promulgate
her
methods
of
reimbursement
by
regulation.
she
claims
that
we
can
report
under
one
method
and
she
can
pay
under
an
entirely
different
method.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
she
is,
and
it
indicates
that
changes
in
those
practices
will
not
be
required
in
order
to
determine
costs
payable.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
your
honor,
i
think
the
problem
here
was
articulated
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs.
it
talks
about
the
black
hole
theory.
if
she's
going
to
pay
us
under
a
different
method
that
deviates
from
the
general
gaap
approach,
she
has
to
put
that
into
regulation
form.
we
don't
know
what
that
method
is.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
that
particular
sentence,
your
honor,
indicates
that
payment
will
be
made
based
on
our
financial
reports
as
usually
maintained.
the
way
we
usually
maintain
our
books,
your
honor,
is
according
to
gaap.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
but
prior
to
1986,
your
honor,
when
the
regulations
were
redesignated,
413.20
had
been
part
of
former
part
405,
and
the
subchapter
heading
it
was
under
at
that
time
was
"reasonable
cost
reimbursement
general
rules".
that
changed
when
the
designation
of
the
regulations
changed,
beginning
in
1986.
the
advanced
refunding
here
occurred
in
1985.
if
i
can--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
exactly
what
the
sixth
circuit
held,
your
honor,
and
that
is
her
manual
provision,
which
is
a
substantive
rule,
when
it
conflicts
with
the
regulatory
language,
is
invalid.
therefore,
we
are
entitled
to
reimbursement
for
the
full
medicare
portion
of
our
advanced
refunding
loss
in
the
year
it
was
incurred,
1985.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
it
is,
your
honor,
and
we're
maintaining
that
interpretation
here
should
not
be
deferred
to,
because
it's
inconsistent
with
the
plain
language
of
the
regulation.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
the
problem
with
it,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the
regulation
calls
for
the
gaap
approach,
and
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
secretary
can
choose
another
method.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
well,
it
indicates
that
changes
in
these
practices
will
not
be
required
in
order
to
determine
costs
payable.
we
have
the
argument
here
that
the
cost
is
already
reimbursable.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
the
only
question
is,
when
is
it
payable?
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
well,
the
other
problem,
your
honor,
besides
the
plain
language,
is
her
interpretation
of
these
regulations.
as
i
indicated,
with
due
respect
to
the
secretary
and
mr.
jones,
there
has
been
actually
inconsistency
across
the
board
on
this
issue.
the
prior
manual
provision
that
she
applied
to
advanced
refunding
losses
between
december
31,
1976,
and
the
issuance
of
manual
provision
233,
under
that
manual
provision,
guernsey
memorial
hospital
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
full
medicare
portion
of
its
advanced
refunding
loss
in
the
year
of
the
refinancing.
that
is
because,
under
the
prior
manual
provision
215,
guernsey
memorial's
loss
qualified
as
a
small
loss,
which
was
meaning
it
was
less
than
50
percent
of
what
its
interest
expense
otherwise
would
have
been.
therefore,
under
that
manual
provision,
we
would
have
received
the
full
medicare
portion
quite
unlike
what
her
treatment
is
now,
when
she's
issued
233.
so
we
have
inconsistencies
between
233
and
the
underlying
regulations,
we
have
inconsistencies
between
233
and
manual
provision
215,
and
we
also
have
a
problem,
i
think,
just
in
a
vacuum.
this
manual
provision
is
a
substantive
rule
under
the
apa
because
it
creates
a
complicated
new
method
for
reimbursing
advanced
refunding
losses.
mr.
jones
indicated
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
thomas
jefferson.
i
think
in
stark
contrast
to
the
case
here,
you
had
a
particular
regulation
dealing
with
the
specific
cost
item
in
question
there.
we
don't
have
any
regulation
here.
all
we
have
is
the
general
regulation
indicating
that
gaap
ought
to
be
followed.
the
manual
provision
does
not
interpret
413.9.
we
find
that
somewhat
curious,
because
that
regulation
reiterates
the
statutory
requirement
that
she
promulgate
her
methods
by
regulation.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
because,
your
honor,
she
readily
admits
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
gaap.
gaap
prohibits
the
amortization
of
the
loss.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
yes.
she's
called
for
it
here
in
this
regulation.
we
report
consistent
with
gaap.
we
put
the
loss
in
our
tax
statement,
in
our
financial
reports,
and
now
we
suddenly
have
to
come
up
with
a
whole
new
set
of
bookkeeping
requirements
for
medicare
reimbursement.
if
she
wants
to
do
that,
she
has
to
put
it
in
a
regulation.
i
will
also
add
that--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--i
believe
so,
your
honor.
she
claims
that
her
interpretation
has
been,
we
utilize
gaap
unless
there's
a
regulation
or
a
manual
provision
to
the
contrary.
the
problem
with
that
is,
she's
using
a
forward
to
the
prm
to
apply
gaap
so
that
she
can
now
get
out
from
underneath
gaap
to
another
manual
provision.
somewhere
along
the
way
here,
i
think
she
needs
to
promulgate
her
methods
of
reimbursement
by
regulation.
that's
what
congress
intended
since
the
inception
of
the
medicare
program
in
1965.
that's
what
the
plain
language
of
42
u.s.c.
1395(x)(lv)(1)(a)
states.
it's
reproduced
at
page
2
of
the
petition.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
yes,
she
could,
your
honor.
however,
we
would
indicate
on
the
record
of
this
case...
we
certainly
don't
have
much
of
a
record,
because
we
haven't
gone
through
the
apa...
but
on
the
record
of
this
case,
i
think
the
regulation
would
still
be
subject
to
rationality
attacks,
because
the
overwhelming
record
evidence
here
indicates
that
the
loss
does
not
relate
to
future
periods.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
the
court
of
appeals...
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
the
secretary
could
make
a
respectable
argument
that
that
type
of
treatment
in
a
regulation
would
be
rational.
however,
in
this
record,
the
overwhelming
evidence
indicates
that
the
loss
does
not
relate
to
future
periods,
and
the
hospital
doesn't
incur
any
costs
related
to
that
loss.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
no,
it's--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--no,
it's
not,
justice
stevens,
because
in
that
case
you
have
an
asset
on
the
books.
here,
the
bonds
have
been
defeased
entirely.
the
hospital's
been
discharged.
there's
nothing
on
the
books.
the
trustee
is
now--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--on
the
record
of
this
case,
yes,
we
are,
your
honor,
because
the
statute--
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
--the
statute
requires
that
costs
must
be
incurred.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
the
problem
with
that,
justice
breyer,
is,
after
the
refinancing
these
costs
are
on
the
books
of
the
trustee.
they're
not
on
the
books
of
the
hospital.
these
are
not
costs
of
the
hospital
after
the
refinancing.
i
think
you're
referring
to
a
situation
where
there
may
have
been
some
relation
between
the
hospital
and
the
escrow
fund.
there
is
none
here.
those
costs
after
1985
are
no
longer
costs
of
the
hospital.
mr.
jones
indicated
a
decision
from
the
eighth
circuit
in
research
medical
center
where
interest
was
capitalized
over
the
life
of
the
asset.
in
that
case,
that
approach
is
consistent
with
gaap.
it's
the
normal
practice.
you
have
interest
during
construction.
you
attach
it
to
the
underlying
asset,
and
it
is
amortized,
very
similar
to...
as
what
justice
stevens
was
referring
to,
depreciation.
by
analogy,
if
you
sell
or
dispose
of
a
depreciable
asset,
since
it's
off
your
books,
you
don't
have
it
any
more,
you
recognize
the
loss
or
gain
on
the
sale
the
time
you
transfer
it.
that
is
the
analogy
that
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board
utilized
in
its
opinion
in
this
case.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
there
were
18
voting
members,
your
honor,
and
3
dissented,
and
the
dissents
are
not
consistent
with
the
secretary's
position
here,
either.
mr.
scott
w.
taebel
they
suggest,
your
honor,
that
there
had
been
different
methods
at
that
time,
and
that
because
the
loss
relates
to
the
prior
period,
or
the
period
when
the
refunded
bonds
were
in
existence,
that's
why
the
apb
decided
it
had
to
be
only
one
method,
and
that
is,
you
recognize
it
currently
in
income.
in
conclusion,
then,
your
honor,
we
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
below.
thank
you.
