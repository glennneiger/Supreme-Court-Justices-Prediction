well,
mr.
jones,
you
say
that
this
regulation,
413.20,
just
governs
how
medicare
providers
are
to
report
their
costs
to
the
hhs--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
to
the
intermediary,
and
if
that's
so,
then
what
regulations
say
how
hhs
will
determine
the
method
to
be
used
in
providing
reimbursement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
mandate
the
provider
to
follow
generally
accepted
accounting
principles,
and
i
guess
you
concede
that
under
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
these
amounts
would
be
reportable
and
recoverable
up
front--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--then
i
don't
know
why
the
secretary
shouldn't
follow
the
same
program
in
determining
what's
reimbursable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
now
wait
a
minute,
i
thought
the
secretary
had
said,
yes,
the
costs
we're
talking
about
here
in
this
case
are
reimbursable,
we're
just
going
to
do
it
annually,
we're
not
going
to
do
it
up
front.
don't
we
assume
that
these
are
reasonable
reimbursable
costs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
this
isn't
gold-plated
plumbing.
this
is
something
that
the
secretary
says,
yes,
we'll
let
you
have,
but
we're
going
to
do
it
annually.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
was
an
improper
cost
report.
you're
not
making
the
argument
that,
yes,
the
report
was
proper,
but
the
reimbursement
doesn't
have
to
correspond
to
the
report?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
they
follow
generally
accepted
accounting
principles,
they
could
have
filed
it
exactly
as
they
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
did
do
that,
didn't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
theory,
the
regulation
413.20
says
if
you
do
that
you're...
that's
proper
for
your
report.
i
don't
know
what
413.20
means,
if
it
doesn't
mean
that.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
concede
that
the
report
filed
was
proper,
or
else
413.20
has
no
meaning.
