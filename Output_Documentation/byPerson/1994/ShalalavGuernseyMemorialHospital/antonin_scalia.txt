justice

scalia
not
don't
have
a
problem,
you've
told
them
to
do
that
in
413.20.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
mr.
jones.
however,
the
statute
requires
that
the
manner
of
determining
reimbursement
be
prescribed
by
regulations.
is
it
your
contention
that
the
only
regulation
the
secretary
has
issued
to
comply
with
that
statutory
mandate
is
413.9?
that's
it?
i
mean,
congress
goes
to
the
trouble
to
say,
you
know,
the
reasonable
costs
shall
be
actually
incurred,
and
shall
be
determined
in
accordance
with
regulations
establishing
the
method
or
methods
to
be
used.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
does
not
always
require
regulations
to
be
issued.
here,
it
specifically
does,
and
you
tell
us
that
the
only
thing
the
secretary
did
to
comply
with
that
was
14.9,
which
is
what,
you
know...
almost
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
the
regs.
in
accordance
with
regulations--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
think
that's
a
requirement
to
issue
regulations?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
depends
on
whether
you
regard
these
charges
as
charges
that
are
attributable
to
what
was
done
in
the
past,
or,
rather,
as
charges
that
are
attributable
to
the
new
financing,
which
is
really
a
very
theological
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i,
you
know,
i
don't
know,
you
could
answer
it
either
way,
and
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
have
answered
it
the
other
way.
now,
if
you
had
wanted
to
answer
it
your
way
and
had
put
that
answer
down
in
regulations
instead
of
in
what
you
call
the
secretary's
provider
reimbursement
manual,
we
would
have
a
lot
more
information
in
front
of
us
from
that
regulation
which
might
have
been
challenged
in
court
at
the
time
it
was
issued,
but
you
didn't
do
that.
you
just
put
it
in
your
manual.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
any
other
regulations...
i'm
not...
maybe
i
asked
this
before,
but
i'm
not
sure
i
got
a
clear
answer.
the
statute
says
that
costs
shall
be
determined
in
accordance
with
regulations
establishing
the
method
or
methods
to
be
used
and
the
items
to
be
included,
and
the
only
regulation
the
secretary
has
issued
to
which
that
could
possibly
apply
is
413.9.
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
else
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
regulations?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
submitted.
i'm
not
talking
about
submission.
i
understand
413.20
deals
with
submission.
i'm
talking
about
how
costs
are
to
be
determined.
justice
antonin
scalia
bell
aerospace
did
not
involve
a
statute
that
requires
the
secretary
to
act
by
regulation,
or
the...
i
guess
it
was
laid
on
an
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
i
hate
to
keep
coming
back
to
this,
but
i
really
consider
it
central
to
the
case,
and
i
am
frankly
quite
surprised
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
secretary
has
no
obligation
to
act
in
this
field
by
regulation.
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
does
one
describe--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
requirement
that
such
regulations
may
provide
for
a
determination
of
the
costs
of
services
on
a
per
diem,
per
unit,
per
capita,
or
other
basis?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
those
regulations
which
may
or
may
not
be
issued,
if
they
are
issued
have
to
provide
for
that,
but
if
they're
not
issued
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
it's
a
reasonable
position,
however,
that
if
you
intend
to
depart
from
those
general
practices
and
principles
generally
applied
by
national
organizations
which
are
referred
to
in
the
statute,
at
least
those
departures
would
be
expected
to
be
by
regulation.
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
statute
or
the
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
or
the
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
regulation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--referred
to
gaap.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but--
--that's
what
i
thought
it
was,
too,
and
i
thought--
--why
did
you
answer
justice
stevens
the
way
you
did?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
but
he
gave
you
a
hypothesis
in
which
he
assumed
that
there
was
a
position
which
then
changed.
i
assumed
that
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
would
be
that
that
would
be
no
change
in
the
department's
policy
at
all,
since
the
department's
policy
is
to
follow
gaap,
whatever
that
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore
the
amendment
of
gaap
would
not
change
the
department's
policy.
it
continues
to
be,
to
follow
gaap.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
the
government's
explanation
of
413.20
a
lot
more
reasonable
than
yours?
the
first
sentence,
after
all,
says
that
the
principles
require
that
providers
maintain
sufficient
financial
records,
and
it's
speaking
of
what
records
have
to
be
maintained,
and
then
the
second
sentence,
the
one
you're
relying
on,
says
standardized
definitions,
et
cetera,
are
followed.
changes
will
not
be
required.
we
won't
make
you
change
your
books.
you
can
keep
your
books
the
way
you've
been
doing
it,
but
that
still
doesn't
mean
that
we're
going
to
make
our
determinations
on
the
basis
of
those
decisions.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says,
changes
will
not
be
required
in
order
to
determine
costs
payable,
and
they're
saying
that.
we're
not
going
to
make
you
change
these
systems.
we
can
determine
your
costs
without
you
making
any
changes
in
those
systems.
just
submit
this
information,
although
today
i
guess
they
said
you
do
have
to
change
them,
that
you
weren't
complying,
but
i
had
thought
they
said
you
can
submit
it
this
way,
and
we'll
make
any
adjustments
needed.
why
isn't
that
a
reasonable
reading
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
would
think
your
argument
would
be
that
we
shouldn't
read
it
to
be
an
invalid
reg,
that
if,
indeed,
the
secretary
would
not
have
complied
with
the
law
adequately
unless
413.20
is
read
to
be
a
substantive
requirement
and
not
just
a
reporting
requirement,
we
should
not
assume
that
the
secretary
was
not
complying
with
the
law,
and
therefore
we
should
read
it
as
a
substantive
requirement.
i
guess
that's
your
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
detailed
is
that
requirement,
mr.
taebel?
why
does
it
extend
to
this
particular
item
and
not
to...
you
know,
you
can
go
very
far
down
into
the
details
of
cost
accounting.
how
far
down
into
the
details
does
she
have
to
go?
how
do
we
know
that
this
is
at
a
high
enough
level
that
really
it
had
to
be
handled
by
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
position
is
that
any
cost
accounting
principles
which
the
secretary
requires
that
are
contrary
to
generally
accepted
accounting
principles,
at
least
those
must
be
adopted
by
regulation?
