chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-1251,
donna
shalala
v.
guernsey
memorial
hospital.
we'll
hear
from
you,
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jones.
mr.
taebel,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
taebel,
what
would
have
happened
if
the
secretary
had
issued
no
regulations
whatever
pursuant
to
the
statutory
section
we're
talking
about
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
my
hypothesis
was,
she
didn't
do
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
she
would
have
been
better
off
if
she
had
issued
no
regulation
under
the
statute
than
if
she'd
issued
the
one
she
did?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
which
regulation
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
doesn't
call
for
the
gaap
approach,
i
didn't
think,
when
i
read
it.
it...
certainly
not
in
terms--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
standardized
definitions,
accounting
statistics,
and
reporting
practices
that
are
widely
accepted
in
the
hospital
and
related
fields
are
followed.
you
say
that
requires
gaap?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
you
relying
on
for
the
proposition...
you're
simply
saying
that
the
language
of
413.20
adopts
gaap?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
with
commas
after
each
of
them,
so
standardized
accountings
and
a
number
of
other
things,
and
you
say
that
incorporates
gaap
without
any
further
elaboration?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
there's
a
conflict
between,
say,
a
standard
accounting
and
a
standard
statistic,
or
standard
reporting
practice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
the
last
sentence
of
413.20,
which
says,
essentially
the
methods
of
determining
costs
payable
under
medicare
involve
making
use
of
data
available
from
institutions'
basic
accounts,
as
usual,
to
arrive
at
equitable
and
proper
payment
for
services
to
beneficiaries.
that
sounds
like
the
secretary
has
a
good
deal
of
latitude.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
isn't
this
a
promulgation
of
her
system
of
reimbursement?
she's
going
to
arrive
at
equitable
and
proper
payments.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
changes
in
the
practices
for
the
hospitals
reporting
to
her.
it
doesn't
say
that
she's
necessarily
going
to
conform
exactly
to
the
same
principles
that
may
govern
the
hospital
in
reporting
to
her,
as
i
read
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
isn't
the
last
sentence
of
413.20
perfectly
good?
you
know,
beggars
can't
be
choosers.
you're
coming
to
get
some
money,
and
she
says
she's
going
to
make
equitable
and
proper
payments.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
and
what
follows
as
a
result
of
that,
when
she
doesn't
issue
adequate
regs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
could
she
then
simply
promulgate
the
manual
as
it
now
is,
subject
to
notice
and
comment,
and
then
that
would
be
a
governing
regulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
agree
with
you
on
that,
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
taebel.
mr.
jones,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
order
number
93-1251,
shalala
against
guernsey
memorial
hospital
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
