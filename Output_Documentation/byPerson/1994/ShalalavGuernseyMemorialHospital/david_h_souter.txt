justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
there's...
may
i
just
raise
this
basic
question
about
your
interpretation?
as
i
understand
you,
you're
saying
413.9
is
the
operative
regulation
on
reimbursement,
413.20
and
413.24
are
simply
accounting
and
reporting
regulations,
and
accounting
does
not
necessarily
determine
reimbursability.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
very
odd,
should
we
not
consider
it
very
odd
in
trying
to
make
sense
of
413.20
and
413.24
that
the
only
regulation
on
reimbursement
is
at
this
very
high
level
of
generality,
413.9,
whereas
all
of
the
detailed
regulations,
or
regulations
of
comparatively
greater
detail,
do
not
even
address
the
ultimate
issue
of
reimbursability.
that
seems
to
me
an
unreasonable
way
for
us
to
read,
and,
with
respect,
for
you
to
read,
413.20
and
413.24.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
true,
but
in
trying
to
make
sense
of
20
and
24,
there's
something
very
strange
about
your
going
to
the
trouble
of
greater
detail
in
those,
when
you
never
go
to
the
trouble,
or
the
secretary
never
goes
to
the
trouble,
on
your
reading,
of
addressing
in
detail
the
question
of
reimbursability.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
the
detail
upon
which
this
case
turns.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
it's
a
pretty
important
detail.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
drives
reimbursability,
the
case
is
going
to
go
one
way,
and
if
it
doesn't,
it's
going
to
go
the
other
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize
that,
but
what
about
the
oddity
of
addressing
accounting
in
so
much
greater
detail
than
addressing
reimbursability?
is
that
in
fact
a
reasonable
way
for
us
to
read
20
and
24?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
is
the
detail
of
reference,
in
effect,
to
generally
accepted
accounting
principles.
justice
david
h.
souter
not
by
words,
but
you
concede
that
in
fact
it
is
picked
up
by
the
words
that
are
used,
do
you
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me...
if
i
may,
let
me
just
go
to
20,
leaving
aside
the
specific
reference,
what
was
it,
in
24
on
accrual
basis...
does
20
pick
up
generally
accepted
accounting
principles?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
use
that
phrase--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
it
refers
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--standards
of
national
organizations,
and
it
refers
to...
i
believe
it
refers,
in
effect,
to
insurance
organizations.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
doesn't
that
beg
the
question?
i
thought
you
were
reading
section
20...
419.20,
and
i
thought
you
were
also
reading
the
statute
in
such
a
way
that
the
appropriate
phrases
there
simply
pick
up
whatever
the
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
are
at
the
time
and
incorporate
them,
so
that
if
those
principles
do
in
fact
change,
if
a
new
bulletin
is
issued,
then
the
statute
and
the
regulation
would
incorporate
the
change.
i
thought
that
was...
that
is
not
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
effect,
you're
saying
that
unless
you
read
419.20
as
a
reimbursement
reg,
the
secretary
has
not
issued
adequate
regs
as
required
by
the
statute.
that's
your
major
premise.
