in
fact,
it
not
only
is
rational,
it's
the
one
that
gaap
itself
used
up
until
1972,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
exactly
what
regulation
is
being
interpreted--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
interpretive
bulletin?
i
think
you
rely
primarily
on
the
general
413.9.
is
it
not
arguable
that
that
was
really
an
interpretation
of
the
interest
expense
regulation,
because
that's
where
it
appears
in
the
manual?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
not
contend
that
this
bulletin
is
an
interpretation
of
413.153?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
falls
in
the
interest
expense
portion
of
the
manual.
that's
what
puzzles
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
taebel,
can
i
ask
you
kind
of
a
basic
question
that's
running
through
my
mind
in
this
case?
as
i
understand
your
basic
position,
it
is
that
this
issue
is
of
sufficient
importance
that
it
ought
to
be
addressed
by
regulation
following
notice
and
comment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
is
it
that
if,
when,
prior
to
1972,
gaap
had
a
rule
that
was
consistent
with
the
secretary's
present
rule,
then
gaap
changed
its
rule,
there
was
no
notice
and
comment,
but
the
effect
of
that
under
your
view
is,
that
changed
the
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
assume
it
was
clear
under
gaap
it
was
permissible
before,
because
there's
no
suggestion
that
before
1972
it
would
have
violated
gaap
to
follow
this
procedure.
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
so
assume
this
had
been
spelled
out
in
a
gaap
ruling
that
was
in
existence
from
1966
to
1972.
is
it
your
position
that
gaap,
without
any
public
notice
or
comment,
could
in
effect
change
the
regulation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
from
'66
to
'72,
it
certainly
fell
into
the
language
of
the
regulation
as
well
as
it
does
since
1972.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
my
question
is,
assume
the
law
in
the
accounting
profession
was
just
as
clear
before
'72
with
the
other
rule
as
it
has
been
since
'72
with
the
rule
they
have
now.
could
gaap
have
changed
the
effect
of
the
secretary's
regulation
by
simply
changing
its
rule
without
notice
and
comment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
what
if
you
have
a
period
where
there
is
no
answer
in
gaap,
as
i
gather
is
your
view
from
1966
to
1972,
and
the
secretary
establishes
a
policy
that
gaap
later
disagrees
with.
now,
she
must
automatically
follow
gaap
even
though
gaap
is
silent
up
to
that
point.
that's
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though,
if
there
was
already
a
regulation
on
the
book
which
had
been
interpreted
in
an
interpretive
bulletin
that
had
been
on
the
books
for
several
years
and
no
one
had
questioned,
she
would
nevertheless
have
to
abandon
that
interpretive
bulletin
and
follow
gaap?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
at
the
time,
under
my
hypothesis,
at
the
time
the
manual
was
promulgated
it
correctly
explained
what
the
regulation
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
was
assuming
that
as
a
hypothesis,
that
nevertheless
she
would
have
to
change
it
when
gaap
plugged
what
was
previously
a
loophole.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
taebel,
following
up
on
the
chief
justice's
thought...
all
of
this
is
under
the
subheading
of
subpart
b.
accounting
methods
and
reports
is
the
whole...
what
you'd
look
at,
but
subpart
c
is
what
deals
with
limits
on
cost
reimbursement,
which
is
an
entirely
different
subpart,
but
it
does
suggest
that
the
regulation
thought
that
reporting
information
is
subject
to
one
set
of
information
and
limits
on
cost
reimbursement
are
in
another
group,
which
include
things
like
interest
expense,
depreciation
expense,
and
all
of
that,
and
we're
fighting
about
the
treatment
of
an
item
of
interest
expense
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
analogy
to
spending
a
couple
of
million
dollars
to
put
a
new
wing
on
the
hospital
and
depreciating
it
over
the
next
10
years
is
pretty
much
like
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
spent
a
lot
of
money
to
reduce
their
future
interest
expense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
seriously
arguing
the
secretary's
position
is
irrational.
are
you
really?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
never
going
to
sell
me
on
that
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that
opinion
wasn't
unanimous,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
the
accounting
bulletin.
that
was
not
unanimous,
the
gaap
ruling.
there
were
dissents
from
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
do
suggest
the
contrary
view
is
not
irrational,
at
least.
