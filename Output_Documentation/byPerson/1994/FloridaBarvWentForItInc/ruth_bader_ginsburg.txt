personal
injury
lawyers,
not
probate
lawyers.
potential
plaintiffs'
lawyers,
not
potential
defendants'
lawyers.
how
can
you
say
this
isn't
based
on
content
if
it
is
the
potential
personal
injury
plaintiff's
lawyer
that
is
being
stopped
within
30
days
but
not
the
probate
lawyer,
not
the
insurance
adjuster,
and
not
the
attorney
for
the
potential
defendant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
how,
in
terms
of
your
justification,
the
privacy
of
the
person,
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
person
who
is
making
the
solicitation
is
an
insurance
adjuster
for
the
other
side,
or
a
potential
defendant's
lawyer,
or
a
probate
lawyer.
if
the
idea
is
this
person
should
be
let
alone,
should
not
get
lawyer'
letters,
then
i
don't
understand
even
the
rationale
for
saying
only
certain
kinds
of
lawyers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
ohralik
say
only
personal
injury
lawyers
can't
have
face-to-face
contact,
or
was
this
all
lawyers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
state
bar
regard
this
court's
decision
in
edenfield
v.
fane
as
a
guiding
light
in
this
area?
you
seem
to
be
making
a
grand
scale
attack
on
everything
since
bates,
so
i
would
like
to
know
in
particular,
since
that
has
been
an
important
decision
in
this
line
of
commercial
advertising
lawyer
solicitation
cases,
edenfield
v.
fane,
do
you
regard
that
as
a
precedent
that
you
have
no
quarrel
with?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
within
limits.
you're
not
quarreling
with
ibanez.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
indeed,
you
supported...
you
came
in
as
a
friend
of
this
court
and
said
the
state
is
not
permitted
to
have
that
kind
of
regulation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
one
of
those
justices
made
the
point
that
several
of
the
questions
you've
received
are
trying
to
get
at...
justice
shaw.
how
do
you
answer
his
concern
that
this
ban
will
effectively
deprive
many
accident
victims
of
information
that
would
be
helpful
to
them
at
the
most
crucial
time
for
them,
that
that
30-day
period
may
be
the
most
crucial
time
when
they
need
help
most?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rogow,
maybe
you
could
just
go
back
and
amplify
your
statement
that
these
letters
are
highly
regulated.
now,
there
isn't
a
form
letter
that
the
bar
association
gives
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could...
does
the
bar,
or
could
it,
consistent
with
the
first
amendment,
require
pre-screening
of
letters,
solicitation
letters
that
are
going
to
be
sent
out
within
the
first
30
days,
or
ever?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
letter-by-letter,
but
the
attorney's
own
form
letter.
