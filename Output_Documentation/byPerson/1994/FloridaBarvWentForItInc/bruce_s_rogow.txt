mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fundamental
premise
of
the
commercial
speech
cases
is
that
truthful,
nonmisleading
information
is
of
great
benefit
to
the
listener,
and
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
the
letters
at
issue
in
this
case
are
highly
regulated
by
the
florida
bar.
at
page
12-a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
set
forth
the
extensive
regulations
about
these
letters...
what
they
must
contain,
what
they
must
say,
the
fact
that
the
envelope
and
each
page
must
be
stamped
"advertisement".
these
are
the
least
intrusive,
the
most
discreet
forms
of
communication,
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
mode
of
communication
can
be
precluded
by
the
florida
bar
for
a
period
of
30
days
during
the
time,
as
then
chief
justice
shaw
of
the
florida
supreme
court
said,
during
the
time
when
a
person
is
most
in
need
of
the
information.
and
yes,
the
question
of
underinclusiveness,
as
mr.
richard
i
think
has
now
conceded,
goes
to
whether
or
not
this
regulation
directly
and
materially
advances
substantial
state
interests,
and
if
one
of
those
state
interests
is
this
theoretical
privacy
right,
then
how
is
that
state
interest
directly
and
materially
advanced
by
a
rule
which
precludes
the
lawyer
from
sending
a
letter
informing
a
person
of
his
or
her
rights
but
allows
the
insurance
adjuster
or
the
defense
lawyer
to
communicate
with
that
person
any
time.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
there
are
several
problems
with
this.
one,
the
evil,
if,
indeed,
it
is
an
evil
to
hear
truthful,
nonmisleading
information,
and
we
don't
subscribe
to
the
notion
that
that's
evil
or
injurious
in
any
way,
but
that
evil,
if
it's
going
to
be
directly
and
materially
stopped,
if
a
state
regulation
is
going
to
accomplish
that,
has
to
be
even-handed.
it
has
to
be
fair.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
justice
scalia,
the
change--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
has,
and
lawyers
are
treated
differently.
indeed...
indeed,
the
regulations
that
the
florida
bar
imposes
are
different.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
i
don't
think
they're
irrelevant
when
the
purpose
stated
by
the
bar,
justice
scalia,
is
to
protect
the
privacy
of
people
at
moments
when
they've
had
an
accident.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
state
has
made
this
argument,
which
basically
is
an
image
and
dignity
argument.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
that
supports
the
notion
that
truthful,
nonmisleading
letters
sent
to
people,
highly
regulated
letters,
have
any
impact
upon
the
administration
of
justice.
that's
a
hollow
argument.
it's
a
shallow
argument
that's
been
made.
the
lesson
from
virginia
board
of
pharmacy
and
central
hudson
is
that
commercial
speech
is
of
value,
and
if
it
is
of
value,
then
it
must
have
protection.
all
i
hear...
i
hear
no
rule
suggested
by
the
bar.
i
hear
this
kind
of
vague
leave
it
to
the
states,
but--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--i
do
not
think
it
could
try
to
prevent
that
image
by
trying
to
preclude
truthful,
nonmisleading
speech.
there
are
ways
to
try
to
preclude
it.
president
bushnell
of
the
aba
in
this
month's
aba
journal,
in
his
president's
letter,
says
we
should
address
the
good
things
that
we
do.
that
is
the
high
road.
the
high
road
is
to
let
the
public
know,
as
the
bar
in
florida
and
other
states
have
done,
that
lawyers
serve
important
purposes
righting
wrongs,
redressing
grievances,
not
to--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--we
have
fought
an
image
issue
for
a
long
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
not
going
to
be
remedied
simply
by
precluding
these
letters,
certainly
not
under
the
constitutional
standards
that
have
been
set
by
this
court.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
souter?
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
justice
breyer--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--well,
justice
breyer,
grief
is
not
the
gravamen
of
this
rule
and,
indeed,
there
are
two
other
portions
of
the
rule
that
address
that.
one
precludes
harassment,
and
the
other
says
that
if
a
person...
if
a
lawyer
knows
or
should
know
that
a
person
is
not
able
to
make
a
principled
decision,
then
that
person
should
not
be
contacted.
but
remember,
this
rule
applies
to
all
accidents,
not
just
the
grief-stricken
situation,
and
i
think
that
people
who
are
in
grief
need
some
information,
too.
the
suggestion
that
a
letter,
which
can
be
discarded,
and
this
court
has
said
that
in
both
bolger
drugs
and
in
shapero,
the
suggestion
that
a
letter
which
can
be
discarded
somehow
intrudes
upon
that
grief
i
think
stretches
the
notion
of
this
mode
of
communication.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
study
that
the
bar
made
was
made
of
200
people
in
1987
who
apparently
received
direct
mail
letters,
and
something
like
11
percent,
or
21,
said
that
they
were
offended
by
receiving
the
direct
mail
letters.
now,
that
is
not
the
kind
of
burden
of
proof
that
the
bar
would
have
to
carry
under
ibanez
or
any
of
the
first
amendment
cases
dealing
with
this.
but
even
if
some
people
are
offended...
and
i'm
sensitive
to
the
good
manners
of
respecting
grief.
even
if
they
are--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
is
a
lawyer,
justice
o'connor.
john
blakely
is
a
lawyer
who
sends
direct
mail
advertising,
and
he
is
a
plaintiff
in
the
case
along
with
went
for
it,
inc.,
which
is
a
referral
service.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
do,
and--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
does
not,
justice
o'connor,
because
as
a
referral
agency,
all
it
can
do
is
identify
people
who
may
be
in
need
of
this
information
and
then
a
lawyer
can
obtain
that
information
from
the
referral
service,
but
the
referral
service
is
bound
by
the
same
rules
as
the
lawyer
is,
and
that's
why
went
for
it,
inc.
is
a
plaintiff
also
in
the
case.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
shares
them
with
lawyers.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
justice
o'connor,
letters
that
are
highly
regulated
by
the
bar
that
must
include
a
statement
of
the
lawyer's
qualifications
that
are
at
the
same
moment--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--police
reports,
accident
reports,
which
are
matters
of
public
record.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
does
not.
it
does
not,
no.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
some
lawyers
may
run
advertisements
of
different
sorts,
but
whether
or
not
they
run
an
advertisement
of
their
availability
is
different
from
running
an
advertisement
saying,
i
am
in
the
referral
business.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes.
the
commercial
speech
cases
that
we
rely
upon,
bates--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--well,
actually,
there
is,
justice
ginsburg,
although
it's
not
in
this
record.
the
bar
has
recently
promulgated
a
handbook
for
lawyer
advertising
which
contains
forms
of
suggested
different
kinds
of
communications
that
would
meet
bar
standards,
but
no,
the
regulation
that
is
before
the
court
sets
out
15
or
16,
and
they
were
summarized
by
the
court
of
appeals,
regulations
upon
the
letters.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
don't
think
the
bar
could...
could
require
pre-screening,
and
one
of
the
problems
is,
is
that
this
delay
in
the
access
to
information
is
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
it
is
important
for
people
to
have
information
quickly,
and
i
think
that
the
bar
agrees,
and
has
stated
in
its
brief,
that
it
is
important
to
communicate
to
people
the
availability
of
legal
services.
but
there
is
no
pre-screening,
but
there
is
a
contemporary
submission.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i...
perhaps
the
bar
could
request
these
letters
and
look
at
them.
there
is
a
contemporary
filing
of
each
letter
with
the
florida
bar
advertising
commission,
i
think
it
is,
so
a
lawyer
is
obligated
to
also
send
a
copy
of
the
letter
after
it's
been
out,
and
so
the
bar
would
have
an
opportunity
to
review
these
letters,
but
it
would
not
be
prior
to
the
submission
of
these
letters,
to
the
depositing
of
them
in
the
mailbox.
we
rely
upon
the
commercial
speech
cases
which
form
the
underpinnings
of
the
decision
below
and
have
been
consistent.
there
is
no
reason
to
retreat,
and
the
bar
has
really
offered
no
principled
reason
to
retreat
from
the
line
of
cases,
beginning
with
virginia
board
of
pharmacy,
running
through
central
hudson,
bates,
zauderer,
rmj,
which
are
on
the
foundation
that
i
have
said,
that
truthful,
nonmisleading
information
conveyed
in
a
mode,
and
the
mode
the
court
described
in
shapero,
the
most
unobtrusive
mode
of
communication,
conveyed
in
a
mode
which
the
bar
has
now
even
taken
a
step
beyond
and
regulated
and
required
that
they
be
stamped
with
"advertisement",
that
these
are
threatening
to
any
substantial
state
interest.
basically,
the
bar's
argument
is,
is
that
that
line
of
cases
from
central
hudson
through
ibanez
should
be
discarded,
or
at
least
discarded
as
to
lawyers,
and
that
bates,
rmj,
and
zauderer
were
wrongly
decided,
and
that
really
is
the
essence
of
what
the
bar
is
saying,
and
its
other
suggestions...
the
measure
of
an
argument
oftentimes
is
how
far
one
must
stretch
to
make
it,
and
when
the
bar
likens
these
lawyers'
letters
to
sound
trucks
and
residential
picketers,
trying
to
draw
strength
from
residential
privacy,
from
those
kinds
of
analogies,
i
think
that
demonstrates
how
far
the
bar
must
reach
to
try
to
get
around
what
the
established
jurisprudence
is.
and
when
the
bar
says
lawyers
are
like
prisoners
and
military
personnel
and
schoolchildren
and
the
institutional
speech
cases
should
somehow
or
other
be
applied
to
lawyers,
i
think
that,
too,
demonstrates
how
difficult
the
bar's
case
is,
but
it
is--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--pardon
me,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
kuhlmeier,
hazelwood
v.
school
district,
whether
or
not
schoolchildren
can
publish
things,
goldman,
the
yarmulke
case
in
the
military,
situations
in
which
there
is
custody
and
control
in
employment
and
property
interests
at
stake
of
the
government.
i
think
those
analogies
just
reach
too
far.
the
bottom
line
in
this
case
is
whether
truthful,
nonmisleading,
carefully
tailored
information
regulated
by
the
bar
harms
any
substantial
state
interest.
the
answer--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
is
true,
justice
o'connor,
and
they
are
more
highly
regulated,
and
yet
that
regulation
must
be
delicate,
because
the
lawyer's
work
informing
people
of
their
rights,
remedying
wrongs,
redressing
grievances,
may
be
more
important
than
selling
shoes,
and
so
it
needs
to
be
able
to
be
communicated
if
it's
truthful
and
nonmisleading,
and
that's
exactly
what
this
case
is
about.
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
about
anything
being
untruthful
or
anything
being
misleading.
this
information
is
important.
it
needs
to
be
protected.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
should
be
affirmed.
