chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
number
94-226,
florida
bar
v.
g.
stewart
mchenry.
mr.
richard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
the
state
is
saying,
then,
is
that
a
certain
number
of
lawyers
will
chase
ambulances
if
we
don't
prohibit
them,
and
it's
going
to
make
the
whole
bar
look
bad
if
they
find
out
that
these
people
are
chasing
ambulances,
therefore
we'll
prohibit
it.
that
sounds
like
an
odd
justification.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
is
it
really
a
terribly
legitimate
state
goal
to
say,
we
want
to
protect
not
the
substance
of
the
reputation
of
the
legal
profession
but
the
appearance
of
the
reputation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
one
reason
for
the
underinclusiveness,
if
it
be
that,
is
that
the
florida
bar
can't
regulate
insurance
adjusters.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
richard.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rogow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
some
of
our
cases,
mr.
rogow,
in
the
commercial
speech
area
have
said
that
the
government
can
confront
evils
one
step
at
a
time.
it
doesn't
have
to
regulate
the
whole
waterfront
before
it
addresses
a
single
evil
that
it
perceives.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
rogow,
supposing
the
bar
were
to
conclude,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
should
agree,
that
this
kind
of
solicitation
gives
an
impression
to
people
who
receive
it
that
lawyers
are
extremely
greedy,
and
very
anxious
to
make
a
lot
of
money.
do
you
think
the
state
or
the
bar
has
any...
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
could
somehow
try
to
prevent
that
image
from
prevailing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
florida
state
bar
tries
that
and
it
just
doesn't
work.
people
still
think
lawyers
are
greedy.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
refer
to
as
the
institutional
speech
cases,
mr.
rogow?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
referred
to
the
institutional
speech
cases.
what
cases
are
those?
i'm
not
sure
i
know
exactly
what
you
mean.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
richard.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
94-226
florida
bar
v.
went
for
it
inc.
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
