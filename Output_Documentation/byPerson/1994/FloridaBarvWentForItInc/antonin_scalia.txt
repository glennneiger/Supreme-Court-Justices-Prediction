why
can't
they
say--
--of
course,
at
the
time
the
first
amendment
was
adopted,
all
advertising
by
lawyers
could
have
been
restricted.
i
mean,
this
is
a...
the
change
was
effected
by
our
decision
in
bates.
i
don't
know
that
the
change
has
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
you
cannot
in
any
respect
treat
lawyers
differently.
justice

that's
been
a
long
tradition.
justice

so
at
least
insurance
adjusters
are
irrelevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
one
purpose.
the
other
purpose
is
the
decorum
that's
appropriate
to
the
instrumentalities
of
justice.
justice

i'm
certainly
glad
i
never
passed
through
the
stage
of
being
a
lawyer
before--
[laughter]
it
might
have
helped
you,
actually.
the...
what
i
wondered
was
this.
it
seemed
to
me
they're...
a)
i
don't
know
if
they're
arguing
this
as
their
strongest
justification,
but
it
did
make
an
impression
upon
me
that
a
man
or
a
woman
who
has
just
suffered
a
serious
accident,
maybe
has
lost
a
husband
or
a
wife,
is
not
a
model
of
a
rational
consumer,
and
so
what
they're
saying
is,
protect
that
person
for
30
days
both
from
harassment
and
so
that
when
a
choice
of
lawyer
is
made
it's
more
rational.
you
can
tell
them
during
that
30
days
who's
available.
you
can
refer
them
to
the
referral
service.
you
could
keep
big
lists
of
people.
you
could
keep
all
the
advertising
material
in
one
place
and
tell
them,
go
there,
but
for
30
days,
leave
them
alone
so
that
they
have
a
chance
to
make
this
decision
more
rationally.
now,
that
i
took
it,
at
least
to
me,
was
a
fairly
powerful
justification.
now,
what's
wrong
with
it?
