stephen
g.
breyer
so
suppose
that
in
florida...
i
can...
suppose
there's
been
a
bad
accident,
and
it
involves
a
man
or
a
woman
who
knows
nothing
about
law,
so
obviously
they're
terribly
upset,
and
i
can
understand
why
you
might
want
to
keep
lawyers
away
from
them
for
30
days.
but
suppose
that
man
or
that
woman,
who's
terribly
upset
and
doesn't
have
much
money
and
knows
nothing
about
law,
would
like
to
find
a
lawyer.
how,
in
florida,
can
they
do
it?
that
is,
what
well-known
ways
are
there
for
people
who
know
nothing
about
law,
who
have
just
been
in
a
bad
accident,
who
think
they
might
need
a
lawyer,
who
don't
have
friends
who
are
lawyers,
how
do
they
find
out
where
to
go?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
asking
you...
i
wanted
a
factual
answer.
that
is,
i'm...
what
actually
do
they
do?
they
could
go
to
the
yellow
pages,
maybe
they
have
a
friend
who
has
a
lawyer,
and
you
say,
call
the
bar.
what
does
that
involve?
is
there
a
system
so
that
people
who
don't
know
how
to
get
to
lawyers
can?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
maybe
you
want
to
add
a
word
or
two.
you're
interested
very
much
in
all
these
legal
cases,
which
is
right,
but
i'm
interested
at
the
moment
in
the
facts.
that
is,
on
the
one
hand
you're
saying
what
justifies
this
are
lawyers'
reputations
and
the
need
to
give
a
man
or
a
woman
a
little...
a
few
days
of
peace.
on
the
other
hand,
they're
saying,
but
how
would
such
a
person
find
a
lawyer
when
they
might
need
one?
now,
so
far
you've
said
the
yellow
pages,
which
strikes
me
as
not
terrific,
the...
maybe
they've
seen
some
ads
somewhere,
and
then
there's
this
thing
called
the
referral
service.
but
i
mean,
does
the
referral
service
get
to
people?
do
they
know
about
it?
is
there
a
way
for
a
human
being
to
find
a
lawyer
when
he
or
she
feels
he
needs
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
way
is
they'll
write
him
a
letter,
and
then
he'll
know
somebody's
interested.
