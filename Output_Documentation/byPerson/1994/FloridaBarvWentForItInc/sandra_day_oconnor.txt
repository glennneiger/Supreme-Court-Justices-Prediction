justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
florida
permit
lawyers
to
solicit
business
in
person?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
distinguish
this
case
from
that
of
shapero?
it
seems
pretty
close.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
doesn't
a
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction
have
to
be
content-neutral?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
is
this
content-neutral?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
doesn't
this
regulation
address
only
certain
types
of
speech,
and
it's
there
with
reference
to
a
particular
kind
of
speech?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
o'connor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
lawyer
referral
service--
--yes,
what
is
there?
--operative?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
lawyers
advertise
on
television
in
florida?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
personal
injury
lawyers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
they
advertise
on
billboards
in
florida?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
your
client
is
sensitive
to
such
matters?
perhaps
you
are,
mr.
rogow,
but
this...
now,
who
is
it
you're
presently
representing?
it's
not
a
lawyer,
it's
some
entity,
as
i
understand--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--went
for
it,
inc.,
and
do
you
represent
went
for
it,
inc.?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
you
describe
for
us
just
what
it
is
that
went
for
it,
inc.
does
in
florida
to
contact
accident
victims?
does
it
study
police
reports
and
get
information
about
any
incidents
and
then
identify
the
people
and
write
letters?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
i...
it
gets
information
about
accidents
and
then--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--shares
that
with
lawyers
who
send
letters
to
these
victims.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
does
it
do?
it
looks
at
police
reports
or
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
presumably
it
also
runs
ads,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
the
lawyers
run
some
ads,
do
you--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
service
went
for
it
provides
is
finding
names
of
victims
and
furnishing
them
to
lawyers
who
pay
them
for
that
information--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
there's
room
for
any
more
regulation
under
the
commercial
speech
doctrine
for
people
who
are
licensed
by
the
state
to
carry
out
their
duties?
it
isn't
as
though
a
lawyer
is
a
totally
free
agent.
the
lawyer,
presumably
in
florida
as
in
most
states,
must
be
licensed
by
the
state,
and
the
state
thereby
gains
more
control
over
that
person
than
over
somebody
who
goes
into
the
business
of
selling
shoes,
for
example.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
respondents
challenge
rules
of
the
florida
bar
association
that
prohibit
lawyers
from
sending
targeted
direct
mail
solicitation
letters
to
accident
victims
and
their
relatives.
for
30
days
following
an
accident
or
a
disaster
and
fighting
several
of
this
court’s
precedence
the
district
court
held
that
the
state
bars
30
day
ban
was
unconstitutional.
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse.
under
the
central
hudson
standard
that
we
have
devised
for
the
commercial
speech
context,
a
restriction
on
commercial
speech
that
does
not
concern
unlawful
activity
and
is
not
misleading,
is
permissible
if
the
government
asserts
a
substantial
interest
in
support
of
its
regulation
establishes
that
the
restriction
directly
and
materially
advances
that
interest
and
demonstrates
that
the
regulation
is
narrowly
drawn.
we
believe
that
the
florida
bar’s
short
ban
on
targeted
mailings
to
accident
victims
withstands
this
scrutiny
under
the
central
hudson
gas.
first,
the
bar
has
substantial
interests
in
promoting
professionalism
and
preventing
lawyers
from
engaging
an
invasive
conduct
during
periods
of
grief,
bereavement
or
injury.
second,
statistical
and
anecdotal
data
compiled
by
the
florida
bar
suggested
the
florida
public
to
use
direct
mail
solicitations
in
the
immediate
wake
of
accidents
as
an
intrusion
on
privacy
that
reflects
clearly
on
the
legal
profession.
third,
the
ban
scope
is
reasonably
well
tailored
to
its
objectives.
we
find
it
significant
that
the
ban
is
limited
to
a
30
day
period
and
that
there
are
many
other
ways
for
like
injured
victims
to
learn
about
the
availability
of
legal
representation
during
that
time
for
example,
by
way
of
yellow
pages
and
other
advertising
and
billboards
and
the
like.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justices
stevens,
souter
and
ginsburg.
