david
h.
souter
mr.
richard...
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
please
finish
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
your...
i
thought
your
primary
justification
was
protecting
those
who
were
in
shock
and
grief.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
said,
we
don't
want
to
trivialize
this
case
by
saying
we're
simply
trying
to
protect
the
image
of
the
bar.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
took
it
from
that
that
your
primary
justification
is
the
sensibilities
of
the
people
to
whom
the
letters
would
be
addressed.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that
is
the...
to
the
extent
that
that
is
the
justification,
may
i
take
you
back
to
the
underinclusiveness
point,
because
the
issue
that
is
raised
by
that
is
the
extent
to
which
the
regulation
in
question
really
does
have
any
substantial
effect
in
accomplishing
your
object,
and
when
it
is
as
underinclusive
as
this
is...
insurance
adjusters
can
get
in
touch
with
them,
potential
defendants
can
get
in
touch
with
them,
probate
lawyers
can
get
in
touch
with
them,
and
so
on...
isn't
that
a
rather
heavy
mark
against
your
justification,
to
be
as
underinclusive
as
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
have
no
doubt
of
that.
i
mean,
i
will
assume
that,
but
there's
still
the
problem
of
underinclusiveness,
because
the
same
people
can
be
victimized
by
insurance
companies
and
by
defendants
and
by
other
kinds
of
lawyers,
and
how
do
you
deal
with
the
underinclusiveness
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
goes
very
much
to
the
question
of
the
degree
to
which
your
regulation
advances
the
interest
that
you
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
richard,
for
purposes
of
judging
this
case,
do
we
have
to
simply...
do
we
not,
in
fact,
simply
assume
that
what
is
being
used
here
is
state
power,
and
therefore
it...
as
a
practical
matter
it's
the
state
rather
than
a
bar
association
as
such
which
is
being
judged
by
first
amendment
standards?
is
that
a
correct
assumption?
justice
david
h.
souter
not
admit
greedy
people
to
practice
law.
