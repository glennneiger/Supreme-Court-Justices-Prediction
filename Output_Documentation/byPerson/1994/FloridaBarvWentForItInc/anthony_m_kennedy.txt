yes,
but
you
justify
this
regulation
by
what
the
communication
says.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
was
not
true
in
the
cases
that
you've
cited.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
here,
you
do
justify
the
regulation
in
terms
of
the
content
of
the
communication.
that's
the
whole
point
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
you
might...
you
might
still
prevail,
but
it's
not
content-neutral.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
follow
up
on
how
this
works?
suppose
that
you
do
go
to
the
yellow
pages
and
you
phone
an
attorney
and
you
say,
i've
had
a
terrible
accident,
will
you
please
write
me
a
letter
about
the
terms
of
the
employment,
and
this
is
all
within
the
first
or
second
day.
is
the
lawyer
permitted
to
write
the
letter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does...
that's...
is
there
some
exception
to
the
written
communications
rule
that
you
quote
at
page
2?
i
mean,
i
assumed
that
your
answer
would
be
what
it
is,
but
i
don't
get
that
from
reading
the
regulation
at
page
2
of
your
brief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about...
suppose
a
relative
of
a
client
writes...
tells
the
attorney
please
write
my
nephew?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
have
to
examine
the
regulation
as
it's
given
to
us,
and
as
i
read
it,
at
least
in
the
case
that
i
put
the
lawyer
could
not
write
the
client,
or
the
proposed
client.
