justice

but
do
you
think
the
effect
on
the
person
to
whom
the
message
is
addressed
is
a
secondary
effect
within
the
meaning
of
renton?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
renton,
you're
not
talking
about
the
people
who
wanted
to
go
to
these
theaters.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
talking
about
what
it
did
to
the
neighborhood.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
the
audience
or
the
message.
whereas
here,
you're
talking
about
the
effect
of
the
message
on
the
people
who
receive
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
should
we
be
con--
--may
i
ask
another
question
about
the
florida
practice?
does
the
bar
routinely
either
prohibit
or
encourage
letters
to
accident
victims
within
the
first
30
days
of
the
accident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
bar
association...
i'm
talking
about
the
bar
association,
not
individual
lawyers.
does
the
bar
association
affirmatively
make
an
effort
to
make
known
to
the
accident
victims
that
they
have
this
referral
service
available?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
mail
those
to
the
accident
victim
within
the
30-day
period
after
the
accident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
if
it
would
be
consistent
with
your
position
here
to
say
maybe
we
should
prohibit
it
because
they
don't
want
to
be...
they're...
you
know,
they're
emotionally
disturbed
during
that
30-day
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
can
regulate
defense
lawyers
and
probate
lawyers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
can
only
be
one
defense
lawyer
at
a
time,
i
suppose.
that's
right.
there
wouldn't
be
a
flood
of
them
in
any
one
case.
[laughter]
but
it
seemed
to
me
it
might
be
equally
offensive
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
evidence
that
there's
these
mass
mailings?
is
that
really
the
fact?
i
can
understand
there'd
be
a
lot
of
them,
but
what
do
you
mean
by
mass
mailing?
what
does
a
typical
injured
plaintiff
get
in
the
mail,
according
to
their--
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
should
probably
pass
a
statute
saying
you
can't
say
un-nice
things
about
lawyers.
[laughter]
and
not
read
dickens
or
shakespeare.
i
wondered
if
that
was
them.
and
not
admit
greedy
people
to
practice
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your
opponent
says
it's
not
one
letter,
it's
a
flood
of
letters,
and
as
i
understand
it
you
said
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
and
i
haven't
read
this,
but
they
do
refer
to
a
study
that
the
bar
made
that
indicated
that
this
was
regarded
as
a
problem
of
some
magnitude.
