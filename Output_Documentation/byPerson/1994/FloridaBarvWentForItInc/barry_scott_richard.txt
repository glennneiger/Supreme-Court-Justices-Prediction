mr.
barry
scott
richard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arose
out
of
the
adoption
by
the
florida
supreme
court
of
a
rule
which
prohibited
attorneys
from
engaging
in
direct
mail
solicitation
to
victims
of
accidents
or
their
survivors
for
a
period
of
30
days
after
the
accident.
the
district
court
declared
that
the
rule
was
unconstitutional,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
unusual
postscript
to
its
opinion,
the
eleventh
circuit
stated
that
it
was
disturbed
that
it
was
required
by
this
court's
earlier
decision
in
bates
and
its
progeny
to
reach
that
result.
the
concern
that
was
expressed
by
the
eleventh
circuit
reflected
similar
concerns
expressed
by
at
least
seven
justices
in
full
or
partial
dissents
in
bates
and
the
cases
following
bates.
bates
itself
was
a
limited
decision
by
its
own
characterization.
it
held
only
that
a
state
could
not
entirely
prohibit
an
attorney
from
engaging
in
what
the
court
later
in
ohralik
referred
to
as
restrained
advertising
of
the
rates
for
routine
legal
services
and
nothing
more.
a
year
later,
in
ohralik,
this
court
stated
that
the
states
had
a
critical
interest
in
maintaining
the
high
standards
of
professionalism
in
connection
with
attorney
advertising,
and
in
fact
it
permitted
states
to
prohibit
altogether
an
attorney
from
engaging
in
direct,
person-to-person
solicitation
of
any
nature.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
no,
ma'am,
it
does
not.
in
doing
so,
this
court
in
ohralik
noted
that
an
attorney's
interest
in
his
or
her
remunerative
employment
was
charged
with
only
marginal
first
amendment
concerns,
and
that
regulation
of
that
type
of
advertising
falls
within
the
state's
proper
sphere
of
economic
and
professional
regulation.
in
ohralik,
the
court
noted
a
significant
distinction
between
the
restrained
advertising
that
the
court
had
permitted
in
bates
and
what
it
referred
to
in
an
earlier
case
of
railroad
trainmen
v.
west
virginia
as
ambulance
chasing.
the
case
this
court
stated
in
ohralik
did
not
involve
ambulance
chasing.
ten
years
later,
however,
in
zauderer
and
shapero,
the
court
prohibited
the
states
from
regulating
what
in
essence
amounted
to
ambulance
chasing.
in
zauderer,
the
court
held
that
states
could
not
prohibit
direct
solicitation
of
clients
based
upon
a
particular
legal
problem,
and
in
shapero,
the
court
took
another
giant
step
forward
when
it
held
that
states
could
not
regulate
the
direct,
targeted
solicitation
of
particular
individuals
who
had
suffered
or
were
about
to
suffer
a
particular
legal
problem.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
this
case
can
be
distinguished
from
shapero
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
reasonable
time,
place,
or
manner
restriction.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
it
does,
and
we
believe
that--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--well,
we
believe
it
is
content-neutral
within
the
scope
of
what
this
court
has
interpreted
as
content-neutral.
what
it
said
in
clark
v.
community
for
creative
nonviolence,
and
in
ward
v.
rock
against
racism,
and
in
renton
v.
playtime
theatres
is
that
the
issue,
the
principal
inquiry
in
determining
content
neutrality,
and
i'm
quoting
from
ward,
is
whether
the
government's
purpose
in
control...
is
the
controlling
consideration.
government
regulation
of
expressive
activity
is
content-neutral,
the
court
said,
so
long
as
it
is
justified
without
reference
to
the
content
of
the
regulated
speech.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes,
justice
connor,
it
does,
but
this
court
has
never--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--has
never
said
that
simply
because
you
must
make
reference
to
the
content
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
falls
within
the
scope
of
the
regulation,
that
it
therefore
violates
the
content-neutral
rule.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
we
justify
it--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--it
justifies...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
just--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--well,
justice
kennedy,
i
would
suggest
that
it's
justified
by
the
nature
of
the
person
to
whom
the
communication
is
sent,
the
circumstances
of
that
individual.
in
renton,
clearly
it's
necessary
to
make
reference
to
the
nature
of
the
film
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
contains
adult
situations,
which
is
what
the
renton
ordinance
provided,
that
you
had
to...
you
could
prohibit
it
within
certain
zoned
areas.
you
must,
therefore,
make
reference
to
the
content
of
the
film
to
determine
whether
or
not
it's
subject
to
the
regulation,
but
what
this
court
said
was
that
that
wasn't
the
controlling
factor
if
the
purpose
of
it
was
not
to
control
the
content
but
rather
to
control
the
secondary
effects
of
it.
it
said
the
same
thing
essentially
in
ward,
that
you
have
to
look
at
whether
or
not
reference
to
the
content
was
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
the
content.
here
the
content
is
permitted--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--well,
that...
that
is,
your
honor,
if
you're
talking
about
the
effect
upon
that
individual.
if
you're
talking
about
the--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--well,
you
are--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--you're
talking
about
the
effect
upon
the
community
and
the
surrounding
area.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
what
we're
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
determine
that
it
has
a
secondary
effect
upon
the
legal
profession
as
a
whole
and,
in
turn,
the
administration
of
justice,
and
that
the
ability
of
the
state
to
make
that
judgment
has
been
entirely
removed
by
this
court's
prior
opinions.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
what
we're
talking
about,
justice
rehnquist,
is
the
extent
to
which
we
are
going
to
permit
the
states
to
make
these
judgments,
as
opposed
to
the
extent
to
which
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
micromanage
the
question
of
attorney
advertising,
and
what's
happened
here
is
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
essentially
this
court
has
said
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
given
type
of
attorney
advertising
will
have
an
adverse
effect
upon
the
view
of
the
public
as
to
lawyers
and
the
institutions
that
they
serve
is
beyond
the
scope
of
state
consideration.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is.
the
justices
of
this
court
and
most
judges
wear
black
robes.
we
hold
these
proceedings
in
a
magnificent
edifice.
we
require
lawyers
to
meet
certain
dress
codes.
why
do
we
do
that?
we
do
that,
i
would--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--well,
that's
indistinguishable,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
suggest,
from
the
renton
situation
with
adult
films.
what
we're
really
talking
about
when
you
ask
that
question
is
whether
it's
underinclusive,
which
is
not
a
constitutional
issue.
you
can
make
reference
to
the
content
if
your
purpose
is
not
to
control
the
content.
here,
the
state
of
florida
doesn't
seek
to
control
the
content.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
justice
ginsburg,
that
may
well
be
true,
and
it's
an
issue
that
was
addressed
by
this
court
in
ohralik,
where
they
mentioned
precisely
what
your
honor
is
saying
with
regard
to
the
possibility
of
adjusters
contacting
individuals.
what
the
court
said
in
ohralik,
which
i
think
is
accurate,
implicitly
what
they
said
was,
that's
not
a
constitutional
question.
that
can
be
dealt
with
and,
in
fact,
is
dealt
with
by
courts
which
view
with
a
very
dim
eye
agreements
that
are
entered
into
by
individuals
prior
to
the
time
that
they've
had
an
opportunity
to
visit
with
a
lawyer,
but
that's...
that
is--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--that
is
what
the
rule
says,
but
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again...
well,
it
doesn't
define
the
lawyer.
it
says
that
you
can't
contact
a
person
in
order
to
solicit
business
for
a
period
of
30
days
after
a
personal
injury.
now,
that,
of
course,
wouldn't
affect
an
adjuster,
who's
not
a
lawyer.
it
wouldn't
affect
a
lawyer
for
an
insurance
company
who
is
not
seeking
to
solicit
business.
but
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
that
the
state
may
deal
with
these
issues
on
a
step-to-step
basis
as
it
sees
a
need
for
it,
and
that
that's
not
a
constitutional
issue,
so
it
may
well
be
that
the
state
ought
to
go
back
at
some
point
and
look
at
that
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
should
be
expanded,
but
the
constitutional
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
state
can
deal
with
this
as
to
anyone.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
the
edenfield
case
was
a
case
of
limited
application,
and
we
do
not
have
a
problem
with
edenfield.
we
believe...
and
i'm
glad
you
asked
the
question,
because
we
believe
that
the
essential
problem
here
was
created
in
zauderer
and
in
shapero,
and
not
solely
because
this...
and
that
goes
well
beyond
the
question
of
whether
this
is
a
time,
place,
or
manner
restriction.
we
believe
that
the
decisions
that
were
made
in
zauderer
and
shapero
were
blatantly
inconsistent
with
two
other
lines
of
cases
that
this
court
had
been
deciding
simultaneously.
one
of
them
was
the
cases
on
commercial
solicitation,
commercial
advertising
generally,
and
the
other
was
what
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief
as
the
institutional
speech
cases.
what
this
court
said
in
central
hudson
v.
public
service
commission
and
in
board
of
trustees
v.
fox
is
that
the
states
are
entitled
to
considerable
deference
in
determining
where
to
draw
the
line
on
commercial
advertising,
and
when
it
begins
to
be
too
much
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
first
amendment.
in
board
of
trustees
v.
fox,
in
addition
to
saying
that
there
is
no
least
restrictive
means
test,
the
court
said
this:
it
said,
we
have
been
loath
to
second-guess
the
government's
judgment
regarding
where
to
draw
the
line.
we
take
into
account
the
difficulty
of
establishing
with
precision
the
point
at
which
restrictions
become
more
extensive
than
their
objective
requires,
and
provide
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
needed
leeway
in
a
field,
commercial
speech,
traditionally
subject
to
government
regulation.
well,
at
the
same
time
the
court
was
saying
that,
it
was
saying
with
respect
to
lawyers...
and
this
is
just
commercial
solicitation,
which
in
ohralik
the
court
said
was
only
marginally
charged
with
first
amendment
protection.
at
the
same
time
it
said
that,
it
essentially,
in
zauderer
and
shapero,
gave
the
courts...
gave
the
states
no
leeway...
no
leeway
to
deal
with
this.
it
basically
said,
you
don't
have
a
substantial
enough
interest
to
consider
it.
in
fact,
in
shapero,
in
part
3
of
shapero,
which
represented
the
views
of
only
four
justices
but
nevertheless
was
part
of
the
opinion
of
the
court,
it
said
you
couldn't
even
deal
with
the
format
of
the
letter.
you
couldn't
even
deal
with
the
letter
that
was
essentially
a
used-car
type
of
an
advertisement
that
said
to
an
individual,
free
legal
services,
that
made
subjective
predictions
of
success,
that
said,
call
me
now.
now,
in
ohralik,
this
court
said
that
the
state
had
a
substantial
interest
in
avoiding
the
potential
that
a
lawyer,
because
of
the
lawyer's
training
and
experience,
could
be
overbearing
with
an
individual,
and
yet,
in
shapero,
in
part
3
of
shapero,
it
essentially
said,
you
can
use
any
type
of
enticement
to
get
that
individual
to
call
you,
and
then
you're
basically
free.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
there
are
numerous
ways
to
do
it.
they
can,
of
course,
look
in
the
yellow
pages,
they
can
call
the
local
bar,
they
can
call
friends
who
are
lawyers,
but
beyond
that,
we
are
not
suggesting
to
this
court--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--both
of--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--yes,
ma'am.
both
at
the
state
level
and
at
the
local
bar
level
there
are
lawyer
referral
services.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
you
call
the
bar
and
they
make
available
to
you
from
a
list
of
lawyers
those
who
have
indicated
that
they
handle
that
type
of
work.
in
addition,
florida
recognizes
both
designation
of
fields
and
specialization
as
certification,
so
there
are
a
list...
lawyers
are
listed
in
the
yellow
pages
by
designation
of
a
field
or
by
certi...
the
fact
that
they've
been
certified
to
handle
a
particular
field.
my
understanding
is
that
most
states
now
permit
lawyers
to
list
in
the
yellow
pages
with
designations.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes,
they
do.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes,
they
do.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i'm
not
aware
of
whether
or
not
we
have
billboard
advertising,
but
this
court's
decision
in
shapero
would
not
allow
the
state
to
control
billboard
advertising.
in
fact,
part
3
wouldn't
allow
the
state
to
control
what
it
looked
like.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
the
bar
takes
no
position
as
to
that,
because
it
believes
it
is
not
permitted
to
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
oh,
yes,
sir,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
has
publications
that
it
attempts
to
widely
distribute,
it
has
public
service
announcements
that
it
distributes,
all
of
which
a
bar
is
entitled
to
do
as
a
public
service
in
the
florida--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
practice
by
the
florida
bar
to
mail
things
to
any
victims.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
i
would
like
to
address
that,
justice
stevens.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
that
would...
personally,
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
a
letter
that
does
not
seek
to
get
business
for
a
given
lawyer
advising
an
individual
that
they
have
rights
that
they
may
seek
a
lawyer
for,
and
in
that
regard,
the
florida
bar
is
not
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
holding
in
bates.
the
holding
in
bates
simply
said
that
restrained
advertising
of
availability
and
prices
of
services
for
routine
legal
matters
are
permissible
under
the
first
amendment.
we
don't
challenge
that,
but
we
believe
that
the
court
should
return
to
the
states
the
ability
to
manage
the
degree
and
the
manner
in
which
lawyers
proceed
to
do
that,
rather
than--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--that's
correct.
ibanez,
which--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
and
we
were
happy
with
the
opinion
that
you
wrote
in
the
case,
and
the
opinion
was
a
unanimous
opinion,
and
we
had
no
problem
with
ibanez
whatsoever.
ibanez
went
to
an
extreme
by
saying
that
a
person
could
not
even...
a
lawyer,
according
to
the
board
of
accountancy,
could
not
even
indicate
that
that
lawyer
was
also
a
cpa,
a
simple,
truthful
statement
which
had...
which
reflected
nothing
with
respect
to
any
substantial
state
interest,
and
i
can't
see
how
that
could,
either.
now--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--justice
breyer--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--i'd
like
to
give
you
several
responses
to
that.
there
are
those
things.
in
addition,
because
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
overturn
bates,
there's
no
reason
why
a
lawyer
who
desires
to
make
the
public
aware
of
the
fact
that
that
lawyer
is
available
and
provides
services
in
a
given
area
should
not
be
able
to
run
an
ad.
that's
not
the
issue,
we
believe,
in
this
case.
in
addition,
we
don't
believe
that
it's
a
proper,
constitutional
purpose
for
the
federal
courts
to
micromanage
the
question
you're
raising,
which
is,
to
what
extent
should
states
be
able
to
tell
lawyers
that
they
can
or
cannot
engage
in
these
activities?
the
one
other
remark
that
you
made
that
i
would
like
to
respectfully
comment
on
was
that
the
substantial
state
interest
that
we
were
suggesting
here
was
that
lawyers
be
able
to
protect
their
reputations,
which
is
what
the
respondent
wishes
to
suggest
is
the
substantial
state
interest,
and
i
think
that
trivializes
what
we
are
really
suggesting
here.
we
are
not
saying
that
lawyers
should
be
able
to
protect
their
reputations,
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
we
learned
several
hundred
years
ago
that
the
manner
in
which
we
treat
our
fundamental
institutions,
that
the
dignity
which
we
grant
to
those
institutions,
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
respect
the
public
has
in
them
and
their
credibility
as
institutions.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes,
he
is,
or
she
is.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
florida
interprets
that
rule
not
to
prohibit
it
once
a
contact
has
been
made
with
the
lawyer
and
he
has
a
relationship
with
the
potential
client.
florida
does
not
interpret
that
rule
to
prohibit
a
lawyer
from
responding
to
a
prior
request
by
a
client,
or
a
potential
client.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
your
honor,
you're
asking
me
questions
now
that
i
don't
know
the
answer
to.
i
don't
know
whether
florida
has
addressed
that,
or
the
extent
to
which
it
has
addressed
that.
the
only
concern
that
i
have
here
is
the
extent
to
which
the
lower
court
said
florida
cannot
address
it
at
all.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
florida
i
can
tell
you
doesn't
interpret
it
that
way,
but
the
question
of
that
interpretation
was
never
an
issue
in
this
case,
and--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--i
was
just
going
to
point
out
that
there's
a
significant
distinction
between
what
your
honor
is
suggesting
and
a
mass
mailing
of
innumerable
letters
to
an
individual
who
has
just
been
involved
in
an
accident
or
a
personal
tragedy
at
any
point
and
who
has
not
sought
any
lawyer,
and
finds
a
virtual
feeding
frenzy
taking
place
as
to
who
that
individual
is
going
to
select
as
a
lawyer,
or
whether
that
individual
is
going
to
select
anybody,
and
the
issue
here
which
this
court
has
recognized
is
that
there
is
a
substantial
state
interest
in
protecting
the
professional
standards
of
the
bar,
and
the
question
is
what
does
that
mean,
and
i
would
suggest--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--well,
we--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--we
see--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--justice
souter,
we
have
advanced
two
separate
substantial
interests.
one
of
them
is
the
protection
of
the...
or
the
enhancement
of
the
professional
standards
of
the
legal
profession,
and
the
second
is
not
so
much
to
protect
individuals,
but
that
the
state
has
a
substantial
interest
in
maintaining
a
community
standard
of
privacy
and
tranquility,
the
same
thing--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--well,
the
florida
supreme
court,
and
the
florida
bar
prior
to
that,
perceived
a
particular
problem.
the
problem
that
the
bar
perceived
and
that
the
supreme
court
perceived
was
that
attorneys
were
obtaining
mass
listings
from
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
of
individuals
who
had
been
injured,
and
sending
mass--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--well,
this
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
cases
that
underinclusiveness
is
not
itself
unconstitutional.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
that
is
an
answer,
your
honor,
and
that's
correct.
it
cannot
regulate
insurance--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--it
can
regulate
defense
lawyers,
but
florida
apparently
has
not
perceived
a
problem
with
defense
lawyers
inundating
an
individual
who's
been...
who
has
been
injured.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
you
know,
your
honor,
the
lower
court
here
didn't
strike--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--that's
not
in
the
record,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it's
the
florida
supreme
court
that
adopts
this
rule.
through
the
florida
bar
as
an
arm
of
the
court,
the
court
requests
the
bar
to
propose
rules
to
it,
but
it
is
the
florida
supreme
court,
after
public
debate,
at
which,
by
the
way,
the
florida
supreme
court
hears
from
the
public
at
large...
it's
not
limited...
the
court
will
adopt
the
rule
as
it
sees
fit,
and
will
modify
the
rule
that's
been
proposed.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
we
think
here
are
numerous
ways
in
which
the
florida
bar
and
the
florida
supreme
court
through
the
bar
can
remedy
that
problem,
which
is
essentially
a
problem
of
the
social
question
of
how
we
make
people
aware
of
the
accessibility
of
legal
services.
we
do
not
believe
it's
necessary
to
remedy
that
problem
by
the
federal
courts,
and
in
particular
this
court,
decreeing
that
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
to
consider
the
strictly
commercial
implications
of
certain
types
of
attorney
advertising.
because
what's
happened
here
is,
it
has
been
raised
to
a
constitutional
level,
and
what
has
been
imposed
upon
the
states
in
reality
is
a
least
restrictive
means
test
and
what
appears
to
be
pretty
close
to
a
clear-and-convincing-evidence
test,
something
that
hasn't
been
done
in
any
of
the
other
commercial
fields,
and
something
in
fact
that
hasn't
been
done
in
fields
involving
political
and
ideological
speech
when
it
comes
to
issues
of
protecting
public
privacy
and
public
tranquility
and
issues
involving
matters
that
may
affect
the
mission
of
other
fundamental
public
institutions
in
which
this
court
has
said
considerable
deference
must
be
granted
to
the
states
to
make
this
decision.
instead,
when
it
comes
to
attorney
advertising,
the
court
has
interjected
itself
and
federal
courts
have
interjected
themselves
to
the
point
of
saying,
we
will
manage
this
issue,
and
we
will
allow
the
states
whatever
the
other
problems
may
be
that
the
states
ought
to
be
able
to
address.
the
real
question
here
is,
shouldn't
the
states
be
able
to
address
whether
or
not
an
attorney,
by
the
manner
in
which
he
is
approaching
individuals
with
whom
he
has
no
prior
relationship,
by
the
manner
in
which
he
is
presenting
himself
and,
in
turn,
the
legal
profession,
and
perhaps
in
turn
the
administration
of
justice,
shouldn't
the
state
be
able
to
consider
whether
or
not
that
has
an
unduly
adverse
effect
upon
not
only
that
individual,
not
only
a
community
standard
of
propriety
in
terms
of
privacy
and
tranquility,
but
upon
the
entire--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
