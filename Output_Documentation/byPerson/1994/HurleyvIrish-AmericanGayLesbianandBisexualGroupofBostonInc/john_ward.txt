mr.
john
ward
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
do
not
press
that
issue
here.
we
included...
i
believe
that
the
court
is
free
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
on
any
grounds
it
chooses,
and
we
certainly--
mr.
john
ward
--we
dropped
a
footnote
acknowledging
amicus'
position.
we
do
not--
mr.
john
ward
--we
do
not
press
that
position
in
this
court,
your
honor.
this
is
a
case
about
discrimination.
the
finding
of
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
was
that
the
council
excluded
the
members
of
glib
on
the
basis
of
their
sexual
orientation,
that
they
excluded
them
for
who
they
were,
not
what
they
said.
mr.
john
ward
the
court
can
certainly
review
the
facts
in
a
first
amendment
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
first
amendment
rights
have
been
violated.
however,
a
finding
of
discrimination
is
uniquely
dependent
upon
credibility,
and
even
in
hernandez
v.
new
york,
for
example,
the
court
pointed
that
out,
even
where
constitutional
rights
are
implicated.
mr.
john
ward
well,
i
think
the
term
"message"
as
it's
been
used
in
this
case
really
is
more
confusing
than
illuminating,
justice
kennedy.
my
clients
wanted
to
be
included
in
the
parade.
they...
the
trial...
they
wanted
to
be
included
in
what
the
trial
judge
found
to
be
an
open
recreational
event.
the
trial
judge
found
that
they
had
been
discriminated
against.
he
ordered
that
they
be
included
on
the
same
basis
as
everybody
else.
everybody
else
self-identified.
mr.
john
ward
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
between
who
someone
is
and
what
their
message
is.
they
did
not
come
in
with
a
sign
saying
"gay
is
good".
mr.
john
ward
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
ward
the
council
has
the
right
to
exclude
on
the
basis
of
viewpoint.
what
the
trial
judge
found
was
that
they
excluded
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation.
that's
discrimination
under
state
law.
mr.
john
ward
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
when
linda
brown
went
to
school
in
little
rock
her
going
in
there
was
expressing
something.
for
purposes
of
the
discrimination
statute,
the
expression
is
incidental.
when
a
discriminator
excludes
someone,
that
also
under
some
circumstances
sends
a
very
powerful
message.
mr.
john
ward
there
was
no
finding
about
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
ward
no,
there
was
no
finding
that
they
were
let
in
in
other
units.
mr.
john
ward
no,
that's--
mr.
john
ward
--there
was
only
mr.
hurley's
testimony
which
the
trial
judge
disbelieved,
but
i
think
the
point
is,
your
honor--
mr.
john
ward
--which
was
he
said
i
never--
mr.
john
ward
--he
said,
i
never
knowingly
excluded
someone
on
the
basis
of
their
sexual
orientations,
which
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saying,
i
knew
that
so-and-so
was
gay
and
let
him
in.
mr.
john
ward
the...
i
think
that
the
point
here,
justice
scalia,
is
that
one...
under
the
antidiscrimination
laws
one
cannot
be
penalized
for
merely
self-identifying
any
more
than
the...
when
a
discriminator
excludes--
mr.
john
ward
--for
the
same
reason
that
if
the
council
had
said,
we
don't
object
to
the
presence
of
jews,
just
jewish
surnames,
or
we
don't
object
to
the
presence
of
blacks
provided
they
somehow
conceal
who
they
are.
this
group,
the
order
of
the
trial
court
simply
said,
let
them
in
on
the
same
basis
as
everybody
else.
if
they
wanted
to...
if
the
council
wanted
to
exclude
all
signs,
they
could
have
done
so.
they
were
certainly
entirely
free
to
do
that.
there
was
nothing
in
the
order
of
the
court
that
said
that
glib,
unlike
any
other
group,
can
come
in
with
some
sort
of
message.
mr.
john
ward
that
is
correct,
but
what
i...
i
think
i--
mr.
john
ward
--i'm
saying
that
didn't
happen,
and
i'm
saying
it
for
two
reasons,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
there
was
a
state
finding
also
that
this
was
an
open
recreational
event,
that
there
really
was--
mr.
john
ward
--justice
o'connor,
i
see
a
very
clear
distinction
between
viewpoint
discrimination
and
discrimination
against
people
simply
for
being
who
they
are.
mr.
john
ward
i
think
that
if
the
issue
here--
mr.
john
ward
--a
public
accommodation,
right,
but
what
the
council
is
saying
is
that
they're
reading
into
the
mere
presence
of
a
group
that's
protected
under
the
massachusetts
statute,
a
message.
discriminators
always
do
that.
that's
what
discrimination--
mr.
john
ward
--because
whatever
the
group
had
as
its
expressive
notion
when
it
formed,
all
it
said
in
the
parade
is,
we
are
irish-american
lesbians,
gay
men
and
bisexuals.
mr.
john
ward
of
course.
mr.
john
ward
right.
mr.
john
ward
the
difference,
i
think,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
john
ward
--i
think,
justice
kennedy,
that
glib
is
like
the
numbers,
it's
not
like
the
sign.
in
other
words,
what
the
council
was
doing
is
what
discriminators
always
do.
they're
conflating
identity
with
some
message
that
they
read
into
it,
and--
mr.
john
ward
--however,
there
was
no
message
in
that
sense.
mr.
john
ward
i
would
agree
that
the
council
is
free
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
viewpoint.
it
is
not
free--
mr.
john
ward
--correct.
in
other
words...
yes.
if
my
clients
came
in
with
a
sign
saying,
"gay
is
good",
they
could
keep
it
out.
however,
that's
not
what
happened
here.
the
finding--
mr.
john
ward
--i
don't
disagree
that
each
of
those
purposes
is
expressive,
justice
ginsburg.
my
point
is
that
none
of
those
messages
was
stated
in
anything
that
glib
said
in
the
parade.
they
simply
carried
a
sign.
mr.
john
ward
i'm
taking
the
position
that
when
all
other
groups
in
the
parade
are
allowed
to
simply
self-identify,
that
the
act
of
my
client
in
simply
self-identifying,
which
is
all
they
did,
is
not
the
expression
of
an
antithetical
message
in
that
sense.
the
court
did
not
order--
mr.
john
ward
--i'm
saying...
no,
they
certainly
did
not
find
any
expression
in
the
parade.
groups
have
a
motive
for
organizing.
people
that
test--
mr.
john
ward
--no,
they
did
not
find
that,
justice
souter.
they
found
that
these
were
the
purposes
for
the
formation
of
the
group.
mr.
john
ward
they
found
that
the
group
marched
in
the
parade,
that
they
were
discriminated
against
because
of
their
sexual
orientation,
not
because
of
any
extrinsic
message
that
they
sent,
or
that
they
conveyed.
mr.
john
ward
it
said
simply,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
said
"irish-american,
gay,
lesbian
and
bisexual
group
of
boston.
"
which
is
the
identity
of
who
these
people
were.
it
did
not
say,
repeal
the
sodomy
laws.
it
did
not
say,
we
question
your
traditional
values.
it
did
not
say
anything
of
that
kind.
mr.
john
ward
in
the
same
sense
that
a
black
person
marching
in
the
parade,
i
take
it,
would
be
proud
of
his
or
her
identity.
mr.
john
ward
except
that
generally
speaking,
lesbians,
gay
men,
and
bisexual
people
are
not
immediately
evident
to
the--
mr.
john
ward
--i
would
call
it
self-identifying,
just
as
a
star
of
david,
just
as--
mr.
john
ward
--i
think
it's
objective
facts.
i
think
that's
what's
illustrative
here,
are
the
tests
that
the
court
has
used
in
the
club
cases.
it's
an
objective
question.
you
look
at
two
things.
you
look
at
what
kind
of
event
the
council
has
created,
what
the
court
found
that
it
was
an
open
recreational
event,
and
then
you
look
at
the
impact
of
the
inclusion
of
the
unwanted
group
on
that
event.
in
this
case...
and
this
court's
cases
have
suggested
that
if
a
group
is
so
organized
around
a
discernible
specific
expressive
purpose
that
the
mere
inclusion
of
the
unwanted
group
would
seriously
disable
them
from
their
expressive
purposes,
then
perhaps
the
group
wins.
in
this
case--
mr.
john
ward
--except
that,
justice--
mr.
john
ward
--exactly.
however,
what
the
trial
judge
found
and
what
the
supreme
judicial
court
affirmed
was
that
the
relationship
of
the
council
to
this
event
was
that
of
standing
basically
indifferent
to
the
messages,
that
that's
what
really
happened,
and
that
that--
mr.
john
ward
--well,
i
think
that
clubs
often
did
that
when
they
wanted
to
exclude
black
people,
and
this
court
consistently
said
you
can't
reorganize
around
a
racist
purpose
and
become
thereby
a
private
club.
i
think
the
analogy
fits
here.
mr.
john
ward
well,
it
controls
as
to
the
finding
of
discrimination.
it
controls
as
to
the
finding.
mr.
john
ward
oh--
mr.
john
ward
--i
think
what
that
really
means,
justice
stevens,
is
there
are
some
circumstances
under
which
discrimination
is
incidental.
that's
the
ku
klux
klan
case,
for
example,
where
the
ku
klux
klan,
which
we
both
cite,
the
ku
klux
klan
wanted
to
march
through
a
town
of
maryland
with
members
only,
and
the
naacp
wanted
to
march
alongside
of
them.
the
trial
judge
said
the
mere
inclusion
of
this
unwanted
group
would
destroy
the
message.
that's
a
far
cry
from
this
case,
where
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
judicial
court
both
found
an
open
recreational
event
in
which
the
parade
organizers,
despite
what
they
later
said,
which
was
found
to
be
basically
pretextual,
stood
more
or
less
indifferent
to
the
messages.
upon
the
arrival
of
the
hated
group,
or
the
unwanted
group,
let's
say,
they
immediately
assert
that
we
have
always
organized
around
a
specific
expressive
purpose
that
excludes
the
mere
presence
of
this
group.
the
trial
judge
didn't
buy
it.
frankly,
i
don't
blame
him.
and
the
remedy
that
he
ordered
was,
treat
them
like
everybody
else.
it
was
not,
give
them
special
rights
to
come
in
with
some
sign
saying
whatever
they
wanted
to
say.
it
would
say
simply
to
exclude
them.
you
let
everybody
else
self-identify.
let
them
self-identify.
mr.
john
ward
on
the
basis,
justice
scalia,
that
they
can
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
viewpoint.
however,
the
finding
was
that
that's
not
what
was
going
on
here.
mr.
john
ward
anything
they
want
to,
sure.
mr.
john
ward
because
that
goes
to
the
essence,
otherwise
you
would
give
a
discriminator
an
objector's
veto.
every
time
somebody
came
along
and
self-identified
they'd
say,
we
don't
object
to
you.
we
object
to
your
jewish
surname,
or
to
your
star
of
david,
or
to
your...
some
other
feature.
mr.
john
ward
no,
but
we...
under
the
massachusetts
statute
sexual
orientation
is
what
it
is,
and
to
say
that
merely
announcing
it
disentitles
you
from
exercising
the
right
of
equality...
i
mean,
for
example,
in
an
employment
situation,
the
employer
could
say,
i
never
knowingly
fired
a
gay
person,
but
then
if
somebody
finds
out
that
the
employee
is
gay
and
the
state
law
bans
discrimination
on
that
basis,
nobody
would
say
that,
well,
okay,
you
weren't
kicking
him
out
for
his
sexual
orientation
but
simply
for
announcing
that
fact.
it
just
doesn't--
mr.
john
ward
--it
isn't
your
honor.
however,
that's
not
what
happened
here.
what
happened
here
was
much
more
like
the
pruneyard
case,
where
the
organizers
of
the
event...
the
boston
marathon
also
has
a
parade
permit
and
provides
entertainment
for
a
million
people.
that
mere
fact
doesn't
convert,
doesn't
answer
the
question
about
what
the
relationship
of
the
organizers
to
the
event
was,
and
what
the
state
courts
found
here
was
that
the
relationship
of
the
organizers
to
the
event
was
one
more
of
gatekeeper
than
a--
mr.
john
ward
--your
honor,
i
think
that
what
the
trial
justice
was
doing
was
characterizing
their
position,
not
dictating
it
to
them.
mr.
john
ward
well,
justice
ginsburg,
we
don't
say
that
they
win.
we
simply
say
that
they've
created
a
new
legal
controversy,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i'm
sure
you
know,
they
marched
in
'95
under
the
protest
theme
by--
mr.
john
ward
--no,
we
have
appealed.
mr.
john
ward
that
fact
has
changed.
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
appealed...
we
appealed
actually
on
abstention
grounds.
mr.
john
ward
correct.
mr.
john
ward
that's
right.
mr.
john
ward
exactly.
mr.
john
ward
right.
mr.
john
ward
right.
mr.
john
ward
well,
i
think
the
most
recent
case,
at
least
the
most
recent
case
that
i've
come
across,
is
hernandez
v.
new
york,
the
jury
selection
case
in
which
the
trial
judge
made
a
finding
of
no
discrimination,
and
what
this
court
says
was,
because
this
is
a
who-did-what-to-who
question--
mr.
john
ward
--no,
it
wasn't.
mr.
john
ward
correct.
mr.
john
ward
bose
was
a
first,
but
even
in
bose,
justice
scalia,
great
deference
is
given
to
factual
questions,
particularly
a
question
like
discrimination,
which
depends
largely
on
credibility.
every
discriminator,
generally
speaking,
asserts
a
racially
neutral
or
neutral
explanation
for
their
behavior.
mr.
john
ward
the
shifting
rationales
given
by
the
chief
witness
for
petitioners
was
the
basic
evidence
that
the
trial
justice
relied
on.
mr.
john
ward
because--
mr.
john
ward
--to
the
trial
judge
and
to
me
it
shows
that
the
person
was
not
being
credible
in
his
explanations,
that
his
real
basis
was
discrimination
based
on
sexual
orientation.
mr.
john
ward
i
think
it's
typical
of
what
discriminators
always
do,
justice
scalia.
they
always
come
up
with
some
sort
of
explanation.
they
never
want
to
say
we
don't
want
them
in
because
of
their
sexual
orientation.
mr.
john
ward
they
started
out
with
safety
reasons.
they
started
out
with
some
unsubstantiated
beliefs
that
this
was
a
group
of
radicals
that
were...
they
got
to
this
business
of
no
sexual
themes,
which
mr.
darling
acknowledged
in
the
trial
court
meant
no
self-identification.
mr.
john
ward
justice...
excuse
me,
justice
scalia--
mr.
john
ward
--that's
not
what
he
found.
he
found
that
on
page...
justice
kennedy
quoted
it
at
the
beginning--
mr.
john
ward
--b4.
i...
they
excluded
them
on
the
basis
of
their
sexual
orientation
and
i
so
find.
before
that,
he
drops
a
footnote
explaining
what
their
version
of
this
is,
but
that's
not
the
version
that
he
adopts.
he
says--
mr.
john
ward
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
take
that
footnote
to
be,
including
the
i.e.,
to
be
his
characterization
of
their
position,
not
his,
but
in
any
event--
mr.
john
ward
--i
think
so.
but
in
any
event,
the
conflation
of
mere
identity
with
messages
and
values
is
paradigmatically
what
discrimination
is.
you
say,
i
don't
like
you
because
of
who
you
are,
and
i
find
in
that
messages
and
values.
that
in
itself
has
never
received
any
protection
in
this
court.
it's
never
been
permitted
to
be
converted
into
viewpoint
discrimination.
that's
paradigmatically
a
pretext.
mr.
john
ward
that
that...
no,
that
that
was
their
final
position,
that
their
final
position
was--
mr.
john
ward
--his
characterization
of
their
final
position,
yes.
in
the
end,
this
is
a
case
about
discrimination.
the
finding
of
the
two
courts
below,
well-supported
in
the
record,
was
that
the
reason,
the
real
reason
that
glib
was
kept
out
was
its
members'
sexual
orientation
and
not
any
message,
because
there
was
no
