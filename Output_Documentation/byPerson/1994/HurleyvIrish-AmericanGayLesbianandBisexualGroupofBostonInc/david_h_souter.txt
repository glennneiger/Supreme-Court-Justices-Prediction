justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
darling,
you've
answered,
i
guess,
two
questions,
and
i
want
to
make
sure
that
you
stand
by
the
answer
in
each
one,
and
i
want
you
to
comment
again
on
the
relevance
of
each
one.
the
first
is
you,
i
think
you
told
justice
kennedy
not
only
that
the
parade
was
expressive
in
its
nature...
i
guess
all
parades
are
in
your
view...
but
that
that
was
crucial
to
your
case.
you
also
said
that
the
particular
message,
the
viewpoint,
if
you
will,
was
generally
a
celebration
of
religious
and
social
values
of
irish
catholics.
is
that
viewpoint
crucial,
the
existence
of
that
viewpoint
as
the
expression
conveyed
by
the
parade,
crucial
to
your
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
interrupt
you
and
get
to
another
point?
you're
saying
that
your
viewpoint
is
not
essential
to
your
case,
and
i
take
it
you're
saying
it's
not
essential
to
your
case
that
your
parade
have
any
viewpoint
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
it
essential
to
your
case
that
the
parade
be
expressive?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
let's
assume
they
are
wrong.
let's
assume
that
in
fact
they
are
expressing
nothing,
so
that
the
parade
stands
on
the
same
footing,
let's
say,
as
a
public
restaurant,
would
the
result
be
the
same
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
message
in
this
case?
how
would
you
state
the
message
that
glib
is
trying
to
convey?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
message
is,
it's
great
to
be
irish.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
enough,
isn't
it?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
agree
that
we
can
review
that
in
a
first
amendment
case,
that
we
can
review
that
finding
and
address
justice
breyer's
question
so
that
perhaps
that
finding
is
in
fact
not
dispositive
for
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
none
of
the
parade's
messages
were,
either,
and
we're
talking
about
that
which
is
kind
of
reasonably
implicit
and
reasonably
conveyed
throughout.
are
you
taking
the
position
that
unless
you
literally
have
a
sign
with
a
declarative
statement
on
it
that
the
rule
does
not
apply?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
are
then
saying
that...
i
guess
you're
saying
that
in
the
absence
of
an
express
declarative
statement,
none
of
these
three
purposes
to
which
justice
ginsburg
has
alluded
and
the
massachusetts
courts
found
as
your
expressive
point
is
in
fact
a
point
being
expressed
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
didn't
they
find
that
your
three
purposes
were
expressed
by
you
marching,
by
your
group's
marching
with
self-identification?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
the
petitioner
has
customarily
organized
the
st.
patrick's
evacuation
day
parade
in
boston
from
which
they
excluded
the
respondent
glib,
a
group
of
gay,
lesbian
and
bisexual
individuals
of
irish
descent
who
wanted
to
march
in
the
parade
as
a
unity
under
its
own
banner.
glib
sued
in
state
court
under
the
commonwealth's
public
accommodations
law
and
one
in
order
requiring
petitioners
to
include
glib
in
the
parade.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
parade
was
a
place
of
public
accommodation
within
the
meaning
of
that
law
and
held
it
because
petitioners
did
not
impose
an
exact
message
or
theme
on
the
parade.
his
activity
was
not
expressive
and
that
therefore
ordering
the
inclusion
of
glib
did
not
violate
petitioners'
rights
under
the
first
amendment,
the
supreme
judicial
court
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
we
reverse.
we
reviewed
the
facts
without
deference
to
the
trial
court
as
we
must
in
first
amendment
cases,
and
find
that
the
parade
with
its
banners,
flags,
costumes
and
music
is
expressive
much
as
a
protest
march
is
even
though
the
private
sponsors
have
been
rather
lenient
in
their
admission
of
expressive
units.
it
is
also
readily
apparent
that
glib's
participation
in
the
parade
is
expressive.
thus,
although
the
public
accommodations
law
is
on
it's
pace
unremarkable
and
poses
little
threat
to
private
speech
interest.
its
peculiar
application
here
essentially
declared
petitioner
speech
itself
to
be
the
public
accommodation
to
which
all
beneficiaries
of
the
law
should
have
access.
this
uses
the
state's
power
however
violates
the
fundamental
first
amendment
rule
that
a
private
speaker
has
the
autonomy
to
choose
what
to
say
and
what
to
leave
unsaid.
glib
has
offered
nothing
that
would
support
such
an
intrusion
here.
unlike
turner
broadcasting
in
fcc
in
which
we
reviewed
cable
access
regulations
allegedly
addressing
cable
operators'
monopoly
of
access
to
their
subscribers.
no
comfortable
contention
has
been
advanced
here
that
petitioners
are
able
to
silence
the
voices
of
competing
speakers,
nor
of
course
can
the
massachusetts'
mandate
be
justified
as
it
means
to
route
out
prejudice
among
those
verdict
to
include
glib's
message
for
a
private
speaker
who
takes
to
the
street
corner,
it
should
be
free
from
interference
by
the
state
based
on
the
content
of
what
he
says.
this
approval
of
petitioners'
unedited
statement
however
great
does
not
justify
using
the
state's
power
to
compel
inclusion
of
the
message
petitioners
do
not
wish
to
carry.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
