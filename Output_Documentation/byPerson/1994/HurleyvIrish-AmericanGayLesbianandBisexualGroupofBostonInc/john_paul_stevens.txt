justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
they
let
the
baptists
join
the
parade
if
it's
a
catholic
parade?
justice
john
paul
stevens
up
to
a
point.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
darling,
can
i
just
raise
one
question?
i'm
concerned
about
the
question
justice
breyer
asked
you,
because
the
court
of...
supreme
court,
or
court...
whatever
you
call
this
top
court,
does
expressly
say
the
finding
was
not
clearly
erroneous.
now,
are
you
saying
we
can
decide
this
case
without
setting
aside
that
finding,
and
if
you
say
we
must
take
a...
review
the
record
de
novo
on
that
finding,
do
we
also
have
the
right
to
review
the
de
novo
on
that
state
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
include
complete
review
of
the
finding
of
no
state
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
ward?
it's
really
remarkable
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me,
both
of
you
seem
to
agree
on
the
applicable
law.
they
agree
they
can't
exclude
you
because
of
who
you
are,
and
you
agree
they
can
exclude
you
if
you're
sending
a
message.
so
the
real
question
is,
how
do
you
decide
which
it
is,
and
the
point,
the
question
is,
for
me
at
least,
do
you
answer
that
question
by
looking
at
your
motive,
their
interpretation
of
what
you
look
like,
or
the
reasonable
neutral
person's
interpretation
of
the
sign?
what
is
the
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ward,
can
i
ask
another
question,
following
up
on
my
preceding
question?
if
it's
an
objective
test,
and
say
objectively
the
neutral
observer
would
say
yes,
there's
an
expression
going
on
here,
but
nevertheless
the
evidence
was
very
clear
that
the
real
motive
was
that
they
didn't
want
you
to
march
with
them,
which
is
what
that
found,
that
real
motive
would
really
not
be
controlling
under
the
objective
test,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
would
be
permissible
discrimination
if
the
objective
observer--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
think
that
there's
a
message
there
they
don't
like.
now,
maybe
they
would
have
excluded
you
whether
or
not
there
was
a
message,
but
maybe
they
can
get
away
with
it
if
there's
a
message.
that's
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--could
i
just
ask
one
quick
question?
could
they
exclude
the
ku
klux
klan
on
the
basis
of
the
uniforms
they
wear,
or
the
sheets
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
is
that
different
from
self-identification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
darling,
would
you
comment
directly
on
your
opponent's
argument
that
the
particular
signs
they
were
going
to
carry,
and
it's
all...
forget
your
motive
in
letting
them
out
and
they're
motive
in
doing
it,
but
just,
i
want
to
watch
the
parade.
now,
would
i
see
anything
that
would
be
more
than
what
he
describes
as
self-identification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
self-identification,
or
is
that
message,
and
if
so,
what
is
the
message?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
some...
i'm
wrestling
with
this,
to
be
very
honest
with
you.
there
is
some
force
to
the
notion
that
this
is,
maybe
a
jewish
group
wanted
to
wear
yarmulkes
for
self-identification.
would
they
be
permitted
to
march
if
they
didn't
wear
their
yarmulkes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
do
we
look
at...
would
you
agree
that
to
decide
what
their
message
was
we
should
just
look
at
what
they
purported
to
carry
in
the
parade,
not
all
this
other
evidence
about,
they
thought
it
might
give
moral
support
to
people
in
new
york,
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
my
question
was,
in
trying
to
decide
what
the
message
is,
do
we
just
look
at
what
they
were
going
to
do
in
the
parade,
or
do
we
look
at
their
testimony
that
i
think
this
will
also
give
moral
support
to
other
groups
around
the
country,
and
so
forth
and
so
on?
what
do
we
look
at
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
is
a
message
on
the
one
hand
or
merely
self-identification
on
the
other?
