well,
let's
pose
it
in
a
different
context.
suppose
there's
a
ringling
brothers
barnum
and
bailey
circus
in
town
and
they
have
a
parade,
and
an
animal
rights
group
wants
to
join
the
parade
with
their
signs
that
say,
animals
shouldn't
be
used
as
they
are
in
circuses.
now,
do
you
think
they
have
a
right
under
a
public
accommodation
law
to
join
that
parade?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
a
barnum
and
bailey
parade
doesn't
have
any
viewpoint
other
than
just,
gee,
the
circus
is
in
town
and
everybody
come.
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
public
event.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
very
different
than
compelled
speech.
i
mean,
how
is
it
that
the
government
can
compel
someone
in
their
private
speech
to
convey
values
or
a
message
of
someone
else?
i
didn't
think
that
was
possible
under
the
first
amendment.
