chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
94-749,
john
j.
hurley
and
the
south
boston
allied
war
veterans
council
v.
the
irish-american
gay,
lesbian
and
bisexual
group
of
boston.
mr.
darling.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
darling,
my
recollection
is
that
the
trial
justice
in
this
case
made
a
finding
that
that
was
not...
that
based
partly
on
his,
i
guess,
disbelief
of
one
of
the
witnesses,
or
doubt
about
the
witness'
credibility,
this
was
not
kind
of
an
idea-centered
parade.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
entitled
to
more
careful
review
on
a
first
amendment
factual
issue,
certainly,
than
otherwise,
but
still
credibility
issues
have
been
traditionally
for
the
trier
of
fact,
even
in
that
area.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
you're
saying,
i
gather,
mr.
darling,
is
it
isn't
just
a
message
it's
great
to
be
irish,
but
that
it's
great
to
be
roman
catholic,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
you
answer
my
question
more
directly?
is
the
roman
catholic
religion
a
part
of
your
message?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
respondent
challenge
the
finding
of
no
state
action
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
didn't
cross
petition,
did
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
darling.
mr.
ward,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
ward,
just
to
perhaps
follow
up
on
that
question
as...
you
do
not
challenge
the
conclusion
of
the
massachusetts
courts
that
there
was
no
state
action
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
can
affirm
on
an
alternate
grounds,
but
not
one
that
you
have
not
advanced
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
an
amicus
cannot
raise
a
separate
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
may
be
the
rule
for
the
massachusetts
antidiscrimination
law,
but
if
massachusetts
antidiscrimination
law
results
in
forcing
parade
organizers
to
allow
people
with
signs
and
placards
that
are
inconsistent
with
what
the
parade
says
its
message
is,
then
it's
a
problem
under
the
first
amendment,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
didn't
happen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
did
your
group's
sign
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
person
with
a
jewish
surname
has
got
that
jewish
surname
permanently,
but
a
klansman
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
wear
a
robe.
he
could
come
without
the
robe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
ward.
mr.
darling,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
darling.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
number
94-749,
hurley
versus
irish
american
gay
lesbian
and
bisexual
group
of
boston
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
