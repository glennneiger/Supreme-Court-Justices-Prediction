mr.
chester
darling
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
government
can
mandate
the
expression
of
messages
and
viewpoints
in
a
privately
organized
parade
over
the
objections
of
the
private
organizers.
after
ordering
the
respondent,
the
irish-american
lesbian,
bisexual,
and
gay
group
of
boston,
into
the
1992
and
1993
parades,
and
after
a
hearing
before
a
trial
court,
a
judgment
issued
and
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts,
and
in
that
judgment
the
supreme
judicial
court
upheld
a
statement
and
declaration
by
the
trial
court
that
a
proper
celebration
of
st.
patrick's
and
evacuation
day
requires
diversity
and
inclusiveness.
this
pronouncement
reflects
only
one
of
the
plain
errors
and
misapplications
of
well-settled
law
that
requires
reversal
and
a
vacation
in
this
action.
the
veterans
council
clearly
stated
what
the
expressive
purpose
of
their
parades
were.
they
announced
during
trial
and
prior
to
their
application,
filing
their
application
itself,
that
they
wished
to
celebrate
their
traditional
religious
and
social
values.
mr.
chester
darling
your
honor,
the
facts
in
this
case,
where
we
have
raised
a
claim,
a
first
amendment
claim,
and
where
the
expressions
of
my
client
have
been
altered,
we're
asking
that
strict
scrutiny
be
applied.
if
that
is
done,
then
it
will
be
seen
that
there
were
no
facts
at
all
to
support
any
conclusion
that
my
clients
either
discriminated
or
were
conducting
anything
other
than
their
own
celebratory
parade.
mr.
chester
darling
mr.
chief
justice,
as
far
as
the
credibility
of
mr.
hurley
was
concerned,
that
related
to
testimony
that
he
gave
in
response
to
questions
asking
at
what
stage
did
they
reject
and
why
did
they
reject
the
group
as
a
marching
unit.
mr.
chester
darling
the
parade
is
inherently
expressive,
justice--
mr.
chester
darling
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
chester
darling
--no,
sir,
but
what
follows
is
that
unless
my
clients
or
future
parade
applicants
receive
the
protection
of
this
court
they
will
be
exposed
to
the
injunction
and
the
onerous
terms
that
have
been
applied
by
both
the
trial
court
and
affirmed
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
in
compelling
them
to
either
voice
a
message
that's
mandated
by
the
state
or
remain
silent,
or
in
order
to
modify
the
injunction,
to
return
to
the
court
with
hat
in
hand
asking
if
their
speech
finally
met
the
focus
and
diversity
and
inclusiveness
that
this
case
mandates
in
my
client's
first
amendment
parades.
mr.
chester
darling
i
would
think
not,
justice
souter.
mr.
chester
darling
the
fact
that
any
parade
is
inherently
expressive,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
realistically
nowadays
people
make
applications
for
parade
permits,
as
has
been
done
in
this
case--
mr.
chester
darling
--that's
correct.
mr.
chester
darling
no,
it's
not.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
if
my
clients
march
down
a
street
on
a
permit
that's
issued
by
the
city
of
boston,
whether
it's
a
moving
assembly
or
a
group
of
persons,
there
will
be
some
people
that
will
make
a
determination
that
my
clients
or
that
group
of
people
are
expressing
something.
this
case--
mr.
chester
darling
--if
it
was
a
permitted
activity
and
there
was
no
expression
involved,
probably
not,
justice--
mr.
chester
darling
--they
do
indeed,
justice--
mr.
chester
darling
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
chester
darling
--we
have
a
judgment
that
made
a
finding
that
it
was
impossible
to
discern
any
specific
expressive
purpose
in
my
client's
first
amendment
activity,
but
this
court
has
access
to
the
exhibits,
and
particularly
a
video
tape
that
demonstrates
without
question
that
my
clients
are
engaging
in
a
first
amendment
activity
with
viewpoints
and
political
messages
and
celebrating
their
religious
values.
the
judge,
the
trial
judge,
acknowledged
and
identified
those
very
values
my
clients
are
expressing.
mr.
chester
darling
well,
we've
described
a
group
of
people--
mr.
chester
darling
--we've
described
a
group
of
people--
mr.
chester
darling
--well,
i'm
sorry
if
i
misspoke,
justice
scalia,
but
the
fact
is
that
any
group
of
people
or
any
individual
cannot
be
compelled
to
speak
in
behalf
of
the
state
or
be
the
courier
for
the
state's
message.
mr.
chester
darling
that's
correct,
justice.
my
clients
define
the
scope
and
content
of
the
parade.
they
vote
to
include
and
exclude
people
and
groups
with
messages
that
they
approve
of
in
their
parade
that
are
consistent
with
the
overall
theme,
a
celebration
of
the
patron
saint
of
the
archdiocese
of
boston,
st.
patrick.
mr.
chester
darling
yes.
the
limitations
are
adjudged
on
a
case-by-case
and
a
group-by-group
manner
by
the
veterans.
they
vote
to
include
and
exclude
groups,
and
they
vote
on
the
basis
of
their
own
personal
feelings.
not
just
mr.
hurley
but
the
vote
of
60
people
made
the
determination
to
exclude
the
respondent
in
this
case.
mr.
chester
darling
no,
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
the
fact
that
my
clients
do
not
have
a
litmus
test
so
far
as
sexual
orientation
is
concerned
for
participation
in
the
parade
is
very
clear
from
the
record.
my
clients
have
excluded
messages,
not
the
people.
the--
mr.
chester
darling
--glib
had
three
purposes
that
were
found
as
expressive
during
the
trial.
they
were
enumerated
by
the
court
as
first
to
express
its
members'
pride
in
their
dual
identities,
second
to
demonstrate
to
the
irish-american
and
the
gay,
lesbian,
and
bisexual
communities
the
diversity
within
those
respective
communities,
and
to
show
support
for
the
irish-american
gay,
lesbian,
and
bisexual
men
and
women
in
new
york
city,
the
ilgo
members,
who
were
seeking
to
participate
in
the
new
york
st.
patrick's
day
parade.
they
sought
to
demonstrate
and
proclaim
their
diversity
on
the
basis
of
their
sexual
orientation
in
the
parade.
they
also
had
a
political
message
to
support
the
people
that
were
excluded
from
the
st.
patrick's
day
parade
in
new
york,
and
my
clients
have
messages
that
they
really
don't
have
to
explain.
they
merely
have
to
display
them.
they--
mr.
chester
darling
--that's
one
of
them,
justice
souter.
mr.
chester
darling
one
of
them.
i
cannot
emphasize
enough
the
fact
that
for
3-1/2
years
i've
been
explaining
the
basis
for
my
client's
speech,
and
being
asked
why
they
wish
to
express
their
religious
values,
what
relationship
do
the
joey's
clowns
have
to
st.
patrick,
all
of
the
most
absurd
questions
i've
heard
in
my
modest
career.
what
this
case
revolves
around
is
messages.
my
clients
have
their
messages.
they
may
be
old-fashioned,
or
they
may
be
traditional
messages.
mr.
chester
darling
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
messages
contained
in
my
client's
parade
are
numerous
and
powerful
messages.
they
include
an
anti-abortion
group.
now,
that
group
had
been
excluded
for
several
years
because
they
wished
to
display
signs
and
pictures,
and
shout
to
the
crowd,
the
spectators,
and
hand
out
literature
as
they
passed
down
the
street.
mr.
chester
darling
it
certainly
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
ancient
order
of
hibernians
have
been
an
integral
part
of
the
veterans
parade
for
many
years.
they
declined
to
participate
in
the
parade
because
of
the
forced
inclusion
of
the
respondent
in
the
'92
and
1993
parades.
my
clients
wanted
that
religious
component
in
their
parade,
the
ancient
order
of
hibernians.
because
of
the
forced
inclusion
of
the
viewpoint
by
the
courts,
the
hibernians
did
not
participate.
my
client's
speech
was
diminished.
mr.
chester
darling
well,
it's
part
of
their
cultural
expression,
justice
stevens.
they're
ecumenical
in
their
irish--
mr.
chester
darling
--i
believe
that
was
a
homily
that
was
added
at
the
end
of
the
judgment
in
the
superior
court
decision,
but
clearly
the
fact
that
homosexuals
and
bisexuals
and
lesbians
have
marched
in
my
client's
parade
for
years
is
of
no
great
consequence
to
my
clients,
that
a
gay
city
councillor
who
is
openly
gay
who
marched,
and
that
appears
in
the
record,
and
he
was
not
disturbed.
and
mr.
hurley
did
not
have
him
excused
from
the
parade,
as
he
did
in
'93,
when
the
court
ordered
my
clients
to
include
glib
with
their
sexual
orientation
massagist,
and
mr.
hurley
ordered
the
exclusion
of
a
truck
with
an
antigay
message
on
it,
and
assisted
by
the
police
they
were
thrown
out
of
the
parade.
my
clients
do
not
care
about
the
sexual
orientation
or
the
religious
background
or
the
ethnic
composition
of
anyone
in
their
parade.
they
select
groups
that
are
consistent
with
what
they
perceive
to
be
their
version
of
a
celebration
of
st.
patrick
in
their
neighborhood,
and
it
has
some
neighborhood
features,
and
that's
why
the
baptist
bible
trolley
is
invited,
and
that's
why
a
number
of
local
organizations
are
invited.
a
great
deal
has
been
made
about
the
factual
situation
relating
to
people
showing
up
and
paying
to
join
in
the
parade.
well,
this
is
not
supported
at
all
in
the
evidence,
not
one
iota.
mr.
chester
darling
it
can
in
its--
mr.
chester
darling
--justice
breyer,
my
clients,
if
they
wish
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
their
speech,
in
their
speech
they
can,
but
as
far
as
discriminating
independently
of
their
speech,
that
is
conduct,
and--
mr.
chester
darling
--i'm
suggesting
that
the
finding
of
discrimination,
justice
breyer,
was
made
inappropriately
on
the
very
basis
of
the
words
you
have
just
read.
the
trial
judge
equated--
mr.
chester
darling
--the
trial
judge
equated
the
sexual
orientation
with
messages
and
values.
in
my
book,
if
you
combine
a
message
and
a
value
you've
got
a
viewpoint,
not
a
sexual
orientation.
mr.
chester
darling
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
court
review
the
entire
record,
because
i
would
be
very
distressed
if
my
clients'
rights
of
free
speech
were
abridged
on
the
basis
of
one
judge's
opinion
of
what
message
and
viewpoint
combined
to
mean.
mr.
chester
darling
messages
and
values.
excuse
me.
mr.
chester
darling
well,
if
values
and
message
equate
to
sexual
orientation,
i
have
difficulty
with
that,
justice
kennedy,
but
you
could
read
prior
to
the...
in
the
same
footnote,
while
we're
on
the
same
page,
the
pretext
and
the
credibility
of
mr.
hurley
were
mentioned
in
this
area
of
the
decision,
and
mr.
hurley
and
the
veterans
council
knew
nothing
about
this
group
when
they
first
approached
the
veterans
council
to
march
in
their
parade.
this
is
reflected
in
the
record.
they
had
no
name.
they
had
three
people
that
were
forming
a
group
that
wanted
to
march,
so
naturally,
when
they
finally
sent
in
an
application,
which
is
reflected
in
the
exhibits,
that
described
themselves
as
a
social
club,
they
did
not
have
enough
information
about
the
group
and
they
were
also
hearing
information
in
the
community
about
the
three
participants
that
wanted
to
organize
the
group.
after
they
found
out
what
the
messages
of
the
group
were,
they
took
a
vote,
and
they
voted
to
exclude
any
group
with
any
sexual
theme
from
their
parade.
they're
entitled
to
do
that.
they're
entitled
to
define
the
parade
in
any
form
and
shape
that
they
wish.
that
was
not
pretextual.
the
court
found,
as
being
discriminatory,
the
very
fact
that
my
clients
voted
to
exclude
any
groups
with
sexual
themes
to
be
discriminatory
in
itself.
therefore,
i
think
the
focus
is
correct
on
that
area.
i
sincerely
think
that
values
and
messages
do
not
necessarily
mean
sexual
orientation.
they
mean
a
viewpoint,
and
it's
the
viewpoint
that
was
imposed
on
the
parade
that
brought
us
here
today.
if
my
clients
were
marching
with
a
group
of
people
that
did
not
have
the
signs
and
the
messages
that
are
reflected
in
this
record,
then
there
would
be
no
dispute.
the
fact
that
the
sign,
the
proclamations
on
the
sign,
and
their
announced
messages
that
were
determined
to
be
as
i
read
to
the
court
by
the
trial
judge,
my
clients
can
reject.
they
can
include
and
exclude
any
messages
they
wish
to.
mr.
chester
darling
that's
correct,
justice.
mr.
chester
darling
the
matter
was
fully
litigated
at
trial.
there
was
a
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
there
was
no
state
action.
respondent--
mr.
chester
darling
--the
fact
that...
there
was
a
also
a
fact
found
that
the
veterans
were
private
actors.
as
to
assuming
some
role
that
may
have
been
assigned
by
james
michael
curley
back
in
1947,
whatever
happened
then
respectfully
is
not
relevant
now.
today,
the
boston
transportation
department
issues
permits
on
a
first
come,
first
served
basis.
my
clients
have
applied
for
and
received
the
permit
for
many
years.
no
one
else
has
applied.
my
clients
run
their
parade.
they
generate
the
money
for
the
parade.
they
raise
the
money
for
their
parade.
they
have
meetings
to
design
the
content
of
that
parade.
they
have
no
contact
with
the
city.
in
1992,
in
1993
we
had
two
mayors
that
were
literally
trying
to
force
this
group
into
the
parade.
my
clients
resisted
that.
if
it
was
a
city
sponsored
or
city...
my
clients
were
administering
the
parade
for
the
city,
then
my
clients
would
simply
have
said
well,
you
take
your
parade
and
go,
we'll
do
ours.
they've
never,
ever
felt
they
were
acting
in
the
role
of
an
administrator
for
the
city
of
boston.
they
conduct
and
run
their
own
parade
and
they
design
it
in
a
form
and
style
of
their
choosing.
mr.
chester
darling
yes,
justice
scalia,
and
the
judge
made
a
very
detailed
number
of
findings
relating
to
the
symbiotic
relationship,
or
the...
all
the
way
back
to
evans
v.
newton
as
far
as
what
had
traditionally
been
done
by
the
city.
mr.
chester
darling
i
would
think
the
compelling
need
of
protecting
fundamental
first
amendment
rights
would
require
a
complete
review
relating
to
our
first
amendment
claims.
mr.
chester
darling
i
would
think
not,
justice
stevens,
but
if
that
was
so,
and
this
court
did,
i'd
be
delighted
if
the
court
would
revisit
the
state
action
that
was
visited
upon
my
clients
by
two
mayors
of
boston
that
coerced
my
clients
into
including
a
group
into
their
parade
that
they
did
not
wish
to
include.
mr.
chester
darling
no.
they...
mr.
chief
justice,
they
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
be
affirmed
in
every
significant--
mr.
chester
darling
--they
did
not,
no,
sir.
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
chester
darling
again,
i
would
urge,
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors,
that
any
review
of
the
record
will
reflect
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation
by
my
clients
in
this
record...
in
the
whole
enterprise.
my
clients
discriminated
against
messages,
historically
they
have.
they
included
the
naacp,
they
excluded
the
kkk,
they
excluded
an
anti-gay
group,
and
they
wished
to
exclude
a
group--
mr.
chester
darling
--a
sign
that
stated,
irish-american,
gay,
lesbian,
and
bisexual
group
of
boston.
mr.
chester
darling
it's
a
message,
it's
an
identification,
it's
a
proclamation,
and
it
is
a
message
that
my
clients
did
not
deem
appropriate
including
in
their
expression
of
their
version
of
a
celebration
of
a
st.
patrick's
day
parade,
however
they
designed
it.
the--
mr.
chester
darling
--what
my
clients
do,
justice
stevens,
is
evaluate
a
group
on
the
basis
of
their
message
and
what
they'll
contribute
to
my
client's
speech,
their
overall
celebration.
mr.
chester
darling
in
my
opinion,
they
wouldn't
exclude
jewish
people
that
wore
yarmulkes.
they
would
exclude
people--
mr.
chester
darling
--well,
it's
also
a
distinction,
too.
that
sign
makes
a
distinction
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation.
it
announces
a
distinction
between
one
sexual
orientation
and
another,
and
it's
clear
how
absurd
extending
this
argument
goes,
because
if
the
actual
statute
itself
was
applied
to
the
fact
that
that
sign
represented
a
distinction
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation,
that
glib
themselves
had
violated
the
very
statute
that
they
are
imposing
on--
mr.
chester
darling
--any--
mr.
chester
darling
--as
far
as
my
clients
are
concerned?
mr.
chester
darling
my
clients--
mr.
chester
darling
--my
clients
can
exclude
it.
they
can
exclude
any
message
in
any
parade
that
they
deem
inappropriate.
thank
you
very
much.
