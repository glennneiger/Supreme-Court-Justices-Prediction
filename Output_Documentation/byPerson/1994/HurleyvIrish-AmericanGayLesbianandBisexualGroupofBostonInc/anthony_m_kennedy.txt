justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
chief
justice's
question
interests
me
also.
what
is
the
evidence
to
show
that
the
purpose
of
this
parade
was
to
express
any
viewpoint?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
want
us
to
make
a
finding,
than,
that
a
parade
is
per
se
an
expressive
activity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
your
case
depend
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
well,
i'm
not
sure.
i
take
it...
and
we
can
ask
the
respondents.
i
take
it
that
the
whole
position
of
the
respondents
is
that
they
want
to
proclaim
a
message.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
answer
would
be
that
even
if
your
parade
is
nonexpressive
in
its
history
and
in
its
tradition,
that
you
have
the
right
to
keep
it
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
that
your...
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
plausible
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
hypothetically,
let's
assume,
following
justice
souter's
line
of
questioning,
that
this
parade
was
like
a
picnic
or
something
that
had
no
expressive
purpose
whatsoever.
that
may
be
wrong.
let's
assume
hypothetically.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
still
have
an
argument,
and
maybe
you
don't
think
you
do.
i
should
think
you
still
have
an
argument
that
even
if
it
is
neutral
in
its
custom
and
in
its
format,
you
have
the
right
to
say
that
it
cannot
be
used
for
some
other
person's
message.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
have
to
take
the
argument
if
you
don't
want
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
one
judge
always
finds
the
facts.
on
page
b4
of
the
appendix
i
think
is
the
place
where
the
trial
judge
makes
the
finding
that
justice
breyer
has
asked
about.
footnote
5,
the
last
sentence
of
footnote
5
on
page
b4
says
the
defendant's
final
position
was
that
glib
would
be
excluded
because
of
its
values
and
its
message,
i.e.,
it's
members'
sexual
orientation.
that
seems
to
conflate
two
different
concepts.
it's
quite
a
confusing
finding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
contest...
i
assume
you
concede
that
your
clients
wanted
to
be
in
the
parade
because
they
wanted
to
proclaim
a
message.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
it's
a
fair
conclusion
from
this
record
that
the
plaintiffs
had
no
interest
in
proclaiming
their
message
in
this
event?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
precisely,
but
the
first
amendment
is
concerned
with
the
latter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
amendment
is
concerned
with
the
latter,
and
if
messages
are
the
grounds
for
the
exclusion
from
the
parade,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
is
the
end
of
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
point...
suppose
that
were
true.
you
know
the
case
of
wooley
v.
maynard--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
driver's
license
that
said
live
free
or
die?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
driver
of
that
car
was
not
engaged
in
expression.
he
didn't
think
about
it.
but
the
point
was
that
once
somebody
told
him
he
had
to
express
a
message,
the
court
found
that
this
was
state
interference,
and
that
this
was
state-mandated
expression
which
is
contrary
to
the
first
amendment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
point
is
that
even
if
the
parade
were
not
expressive
earlier,
and
i
doubt
that,
but
even
if
it
were,
i
should
think
the
organizers
could
say
we
don't
want
it
turned
into
an
expressive
activity,
and
that
this
case
is
much
easier
than
a
driver's
license
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
can
we
just
get
one
thing
established.
you
would
agree
that
if
the
reason
for
the
exclusion
of
your
clients
was
solely
because
of
their
message...
solely
because
of
their
message...
that
the
exclusion
would
be
within
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
organizers
of
a
private
parade?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
agree
with
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
including
your
client's
viewpoint.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
know
that
seriously
disable
is
found
in
any
of
our
cases.
i
think
quite
the
contrary,
that
if
you
have
an
expressive
purpose,
you're
entitled
to
maintain
the
purity
of
that
expression.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
newspapers,
for
instance,
can't
be
required
to
print
retraction
articles.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
think
even
if
that
were
so
historically
they
could
change
their
position
when
another
group
wants
to
have
a
message.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
trial
court
says
the
veteran's
position
is
paradoxical.
a
proper
celebration
of
st.
patrick's
and
evacuation
day
requires
diversity
and
inclusiveness.
i
suggest
that
for
a
state
entity,
which
is
the
court,
to
tell
a
private
speaker
how
to
celebrate
st.
patrick's
day
is
antithetical
to
first
amendment
principles.
