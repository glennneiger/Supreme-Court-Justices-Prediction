mr.
darling,
i
understood
your
brief
to
say
this
is
your
parade
and
you
can
do
with
it
what
you
will,
somebody
else
can
do
what
they
will
with
their
parade.
that's
the
essence
of
your
argument.
it's
your
parade
to
make
it
do
whatever
you
want
it
to
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you--
--are
there
any
limitations
on
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
darling,
before
you
finish,
there
was
one
of
the
friends
of
the
court
that
suggested
that
there
was
an
open
issue
here
about
perhaps
state
action.
i
think
you
would
concede,
would
you
not,
that
if
this
were
the
state
of
massachusetts
or
the
city
of
boston
parade,
they
could
not
pick
and
choose
among
messages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
about
the
notion
that
because
there
were
so
many
close
ties
between
your
group,
the
veterans
council,
and
the
city
of
boston,
this
state
action
or
governmental
action
was
implicated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
finding
that
boston
wasn't
involved
and
so
the
municipal
defendants
were
dismissed,
but
what
about
the
notion
that
you
took
on
the
mantle
of
the
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
ward,
what
about
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ward,
there
is...
there
are
three...
there's
a
statement
i
think
in
the
court
of
first
instance
and
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
three
purposes.
they
sound
like
they're
expressive.
the
last
one
was
support
for
the
new
york
group
that
was
seeking
to
march
in
the
parade
there.
now,
would
you
review
those
three
and
tell
me
why
each
of
them
is
not
conveying
a
message?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
ward,
you
agree
with
that,
don't
you,
because
you
urged,
did
you
not,
that
this
case
was
now
moot,
because
you
now
concede
that
this
parade
has
an
expressive
purpose
and
therefore
they
can
take
the
position
that
you're
opposing...
they
can
now
take
it...
your
conduct
hasn't
changed.
what
has
changed,
that
you
now
say
it's
legitimate
to
deny
you
the
right
that
was
vindicated
for
you
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
you
said
the
reason
this
case
is
moot
is
that
you're
not
contesting
that,
that
you
did
not
contest...
after
the
district
court
ruled
against
you,
you
didn't
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have.
