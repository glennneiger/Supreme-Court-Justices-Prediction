justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
made
that
argument
in
your
brief,
frankly.
i'm
surprised
that
this
comes
to
you
as
a
revelation.
i
thought
it
was
in
your
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
darling,
i
thought
you
said
you
couldn't
do
whatever
you
wanted
with
a
parade.
i
thought
you
conceded
that
you
could
not
exclude
gays,
lesbians,
and
bisexuals
from
marching
in
the
parade
if
they
want
to
march,
so
long
as
they
are
not
trying
to
convey
a
message
which
you
do
not
want
conveyed.
you
don't
contest
that
the
massachusetts
law
is
applicable
to
the
parade
insofar
as
the
exclusion
of
someone
simply
for
being
a
homosexual
or
lesbian
or
a
bisexual
is
concerned,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
as
i
recall,
the
district
court
found
that
st.
patrick
would
not
have
excluded
the
homosexuals,
lesbians,
and
bisexuals,
isn't
that
right,
something
to
that
effect.
his
mission
was
not
just
to
the
straights,
or
something
of
that
sort.
[laughter]
is
that
a
finding
of
the
district
court,
or
the
lower
court
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
was
found
by
the
trial
court,
wasn't
it.
i
mean,
it
said
that
there
was
no
symbiotic
relationship,
is
how
it
was
addressed.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
get
back
to
the
question
of
why
glib
wanted
to
be
in
the
parade,
they
didn't
want
to
be
there
to
recreate,
as
was
found
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
court.
glib's
purposes
are
to
express
its
members'
pride
in
their
dual
identities
as
irish
or
irish-american,
to
demonstrate
to
the
irish-american
community
and
to
the
gay,
lesbian,
and
bisexual
community
the
diversity
within
those...
and
to
show
support.
all
of
those
are
expressive
activities.
they
were
there
to
express
something,
weren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
not
incidental.
if
these
people
were
allowed
in
to
march
in
other
units
and
were
not
excluded
from...
was
there
any
evidence
of
that
by--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no
finding
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
finding
that
they
weren't,
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
any
evidence
whatever
that
a
person
would
be
excluded
from
the
parade,
marching
in
another
unit,
if
that
person
was
homosexual
or
lesbian
or
bisexual?
was
there
any
evidence
whatever
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
was
the
opposite.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
basis
on
saying
that
this
existed,
that
somebody
else
said
it
didn't
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
also
not
the
same
thing
as
evidence
that
somebody
was
excluded
simply
because
of
his
sexual
orientation.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
this
isn't
a
matter
of
penalizing.
it's
a
matter
of
not
wanting
to
convey
the
expressions,
the
demonstrations,
and
the
showings
of
support
that
this
group
wanted
to
make
in
that
particular
parade.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
reading
into
it.
the
group
said
that
they
wanted
to
express
their
pride
in
their
dual
identities
as
irish
and
homosexuals.
this
group
does
not
believe,
whether
you
agree
with
it
or
not,
that
being
homosexual
is
something
to
be
proud
of,
and
therefore
do
not
want
that
idea
to
be
expressed
in
their
parade.
why
is
that
not
simply
saying
you
don't
have
to
have
expressed
what
you
do
not
want
to
have
expressed?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
enough
to
show
that
you
are
proud
of
that
fact,
which
is
what
their
object
is
to
express
their
pride
in
those
dual
identities.
that's
all
you
need
to
show
that
pride,
is
to
hang
it
up
in
a
sign.
how
else
does
one
show
pride
in
a
certain
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right,
and
if
that
person
held
up
a
sign
and
said,
black
unity,
that
would
be
an
expression
of
pride
in
blackness.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
i
mean,
the
point
at
issue
is
whether
there's
an
expression
of
anything
in
their
mere
marching
with
a
sign
saying
what
they
are,
and
it
seems
to
me
you
must
acknowledge
that
it
is...
there
is
an
expression
of
pride
in
what
they
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
you
mean,
by
self-identifying,
pride.
i'll
accept
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
they
didn't.
they
didn't
let
everybody
else...
was
that
the
finding,
that
no
group
was
ever
excluded?
they
kept
out
the
kkk,
didn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
well,
if
you
assume
that
there's
no
expression
going
on
here
i
think
that's
probably
right.
but
let
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
a
first
amendment
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
try
bose.
justice
antonin
scalia
bose
was
a
first
amendment
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
evidence
was
there
for
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation
as
opposed
to
expression?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
that
show
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
show
casting
about
for
something
that
the
trial
court
would
accept.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
it
leads
to
that
conclusion.
it
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
he's
trying
to
come
up
with
something
that
the
court
will
accept.
as
it
turns
out,
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
did
this
shift?
i
mean,
what
were
the
shifts
in
their
explanation?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
trial
judge
finds
that
g-l-b
would
be
excluded
because
of
its
values
and
its
message,
i.e.,
its
members'
sexual
orientation.
if
that's
what
the
trial
court
means
by
sexual
orientation,
i'm
very
troubled,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
i.e.
is
i.e.,
it's
not
the
g-l...
the
defendant's
final
position
was
the
g-l-i-b
would
be
excluded
because
of
its
values
and
its
message,
i.e....
and
this
is
the
court
speaking...
its
members'
sexual
orientation,
so
apparently
the
court
thinks
that
exclusion
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation
consists
of
excluding
because
of
value
and
message.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
defendants'
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you're
saying
about
the
i.e.,
because
this
is
very
important
to
me.
it
says
what
the
finding
of
sexual
orientation
means.
you're
saying
that
the
trial
judge
was
saying
that
the
defendants,
that
is,
the
veterans
group
managing
the
parade,
admitted
that
they
were
excluding
people
because
of
their
members'
sexual
orientation?
is
that
what
the
i.e.
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
his
characterization
of--
