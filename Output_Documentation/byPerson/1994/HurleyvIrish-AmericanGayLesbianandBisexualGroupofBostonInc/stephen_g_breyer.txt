justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
are
we
supposed
to
do...
i
take
it
that
you
concede,
or
do
you
not,
that
if
your
groups
want
to...
your
group
cannot
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
can
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just...
you
wouldn't
let
a
person
in
just
because
he
was
afro-american,
that
was
your
only
reason?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
that's
not
my
point.
my
point
actually
is
that
there's
a
factual
finding
in
this
record,
i
take
it...
the
sjc
says
that
the
judge
found
that
glib
was
excluded
from
the
parade
because
of
the
sexual
orientation
of
its
members.
now,
that's
a
finding
that
we
have
here,
and
so
is
that
finding...
are
we
supposed
to
accept
that,
or
reject
that?
i
take
it
that
there's
a
finding
that
the
parade
normally
includes
everybody,
and
however
they
didn't
include
these
people
not
because
they
weren't
proud
to
be
irish,
they
were,
but
because
they
didn't
like
their
sexual
orientation.
now,
i
just
read
that
sentence
is
what
it
said
in
the
sjc,
so
are
you
saying
that
you
do
have
a
right
to
exclude
because
of
the
sexual
orientation,
or
are
you
saying
that
wasn't
why
they
were
excluded,
and
if
it's
the
latter,
what
do
we
do
about
the
fact-finding?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
what
are
we
supposed
to
do,
because
what
we
have
is
that
sentence
of
the
supreme
judicial
court,
which
i
take
it
is
a
finding.
are
we
supposed
to
say...
look
into
the
record
and
say
they're
wrong?
are
we
supposed
to
remand
it
for
a
further
factual
finding?
are
we
supposed
to
take
it
as
a
fact?
what
do
you
suggest
we
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wanted
to
ask
you,
i'm
having
trouble
with
your
ku
klux
klan
example,
because
there
is
no
state
law
that
says
we're
going
to
protect
members
of
the
ku
klux
klan
the
same
way
we
protect
sexual
orientation.
i
take
it
there
is
a
state
law
that
protects
sexual
orientation
and
forbids
discrimination
on
that
basis
just
as
race,
religion,
national
origin.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
we
take
that
as
a
given.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
it
has
to
be
exactly
the
same
as
if
we're
saying,
no
african
americans,
or
no
irish,
or
whatever.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
given.
all
right.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
is
it
actually
motive
that
is
irrelevant?
i
mean,
if
in
fact
the
real
reason
were
because
of
sexual
orientation
and
the
group
doesn't
really
care
about
the
message,
that's
just
a
pretext,
then
i
guess
your
point
is
there
is
no...
there
is
no
constitutional
right
when
you
don't
care
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
sign
that
says
glib>
["].
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
your...
all
right.
now,
what
i'm
getting
to
is
this.
if
that's
where
we're
all
more
or
less
starting,
and
the
real
motive
would
be
relevant,
here
we
have
your
finding.
have
you
found
in
supreme
court
cases,
and
this
is
what...
you've
read
them
more
recently.
who
goes
into
the
factual
record
to
decide
whether
or
not
that
finding
really
is
supported
or
not
supported?
is
it
supposed
to
take
place
in
this
court?
are
there
cases
that
say
we
would
remand
it
for
further
consideration
by
the
sjc,
or
back
to
the
trial
court?
how,
from
your
reading
of
the
cases,
should
we
deal
with
the
proper
resolution
of
that
factual
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
their
actual
reason
was
that
the
sign
calls
attention
to
a
fact
that
makes
them
feel
uncomfortable.
is
that
a
justification?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
that
stand?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
where
does
it
stand
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
what
happens
is
that
that
just
makes
them
feel
uncomfortable,
since
it's
public,
and
they
don't
like
it.
now,
where
does
that
stand
under
first
amendment
law?
