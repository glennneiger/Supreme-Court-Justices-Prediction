mr.
allan
r.
chason
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
o'connor
asked
mr.
farr
if
the...
a
broad
reading
of
the
statue
would
in
fact
sweep
away
state
law.
that
is
our
position
exactly,
that
a
broad
reading
of
section
2,
particularly
to
the
limits
of
the
constitutional
powers
of
congress,
would,
in
fact,
sweep
away
a
great
amount
of
state
law
and,
in
fact,
we
cannot
imagine
congressional
intent
in
1925
for
congress
to
regulate
contracts
where
people
in
a
city
arrange
to
have
insects
in
their
home
sprayed.
we
cannot
imagine
a
congressional
intent
to
reach
that
far
into
traditionally
state
matters.
i
would
like
to
turn
first
in
this
question
of
statutory
construction
to
the
express
language
of
the
act.
i
would
like
to
draw
into
that
the
legislative
history,
because
we
draw
different
conclusions
from
the
legislative
history
as
the
ones
that
mr.
farr
has
outlined
for
you.
first,
the
choice
of
the
word
"involving"
commerce
we
believe
is
important,
because,
as
the
chief
justice
has
mentioned,
traditionally
the
word
"affecting"
commerce
has
been
used
when
congress
wanted
to
use
all
of
its
constitutional
power.
the
question
was
asked
whether
that
was
a
term
of
art
in
1925.
well,
we
don't...
we
can't
look
into
the
minds
of
the
congressmen
that
voted
on
that
act,
but
we...
what
we
can
say
is
that
they
were
aware
that
they
had
less
than...
that
they
had
more
power
than
to
only
regulate
contracts
which
were
directly
in
commerce,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
our
cite
in
footnote
17
of
our
brief
to
two
cases
of
that
era,
and
as
the
will
v.
department
of
state
police
case
tells
us,
that's
what
we
look
to,
are
the
authorities
of
the
era.
we
don't
know,
as
justice
scalia
mentioned
yesterday,
exactly
what
these
congressmen
were
thinking
about
in
1925,
or
whether
they
read
supreme
court
precedent,
but
nevertheless,
in
trying
to
give
some
meaning
to
the
word
1922.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
yes,
sir.
excuse
me.
the
coronado
coal
company
case,
and
also
to
the
united
leather
workers
case
in
1924,
both
of
which
preceded
the
passage
of
the
act
in
1925,
and
the
reason
that
we
believe
that
those
cases
are
important
is
that
they
very
clearly
draw
a
distinction
between
the
two
kinds
of
powers
which
the...
which
congress
had
under
the
commerce
clause.
that
case
talked
about
the
fact
that
on
the
one
hand
congress
had
power
to
regulate
matters
which
were
in
the
current
or
flow
of
commerce,
and
in
talking
about
what
was
in
the
current
or
flow
of
commerce,
they
used
the
words,
matters
which
involve
commerce
intrinsically,
involving
commerce
intrinsically.
now,
whether
that
was
a
specific
language
that
congress
had
reference
to
2
years
later
when
they
passed
this
act,
we
cannot
know,
but
that
was
an
authority
of
the
era,
and
the
same
language
was
used
again
in
the
united
leather
workers
case
2
years
later.
now--
mr.
allan
r.
chason
--justice
scalia,
that's
a
difficult
question,
whether
simply
the
fact
that
crossing
state
lines
is
commerce.
now,
we
cited
in
footnote
16
of
our
brief
the
ware
and
leland
case
and
cases
which
hold
that
the
mere
residence
of
the
parties
does
not
amount--
mr.
allan
r.
chason
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
my
difficulty
with
your
hypothetical,
justice
scalia,
is
that
again
it
is
hard
to
imagine,
particularly
if
the
performance
of
the
contract
involved
consumers,
that
congress
could
have
intended
to
regulate
that
kind
of
transaction.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
the
way
this
contract
was
performed
was
that
terminix,
through
its
local
office
in
the
same
community
where
these
people
lived,
sent
a
truck
just
a
matter
of
a
few
blocks,
or
maybe
miles,
over
to
spray
insects
in
their
home,
and
terminix
can
only
point
to
two
things
which
might
offer
some
connection
with
interstate
commerce.
they
say
that
the
pesticides
that
were
sprayed
were
made
in
states
other
than
alabama
and
sent
there...
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
that
is
true
or
not...
and
then
that
the
companies
were
organized
in
states
other
than
alabama,
and
we
just
think
that
those
tenuous
kinds
of
connections
with
interstate
commerce
is
not
what
congress
intended.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
well,
if
your
honor
is
speaking
of
the
way
that
the
contract
was
actually
performed,
we
had
no
way
of
knowing
that.
it
could
not
have
been
within
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
parties,
and
i
think--
mr.
allan
r.
chason
--yes,
your
honor,
the--
mr.
allan
r.
chason
--your
honor,
i
would
feel
that
in
the
first
place
that
statement
in
perry
v.
thomas
is
dictum
because
it
was
a
state
court
case
where
that
finding
was
not
necessary
to
the
holding
of
the
case.
now,
questions
about
the
purposes
for
which...
the
breadth
of
the
purposes
of
liberal
federal
policy
and
so
forth
might
fairly
be
applied
to
questions
like
in
perry
v.
thomas,
where
the
issue
is
not
so
much
what
is
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
the
statute,
but,
rather,
the
question
is,
given
that
the
statute
reaches
this
problem,
what
is
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
agreement?
we
would
submit
that
those
are
two
very
different
inquiries,
that
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
the
statute
involves
matters
of
federalism
which
this
court
in
the
gregory
v.
ashcroft
line
of
cases
has
in
recent
years
relied
on,
requiring
a
plain
statement
rule
that
congress--
mr.
allan
r.
chason
--i
think
that
the
court
needs
to
resolve
the
question
concerning
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
the
statute,
whether
the
statute
applies
in
state
or
federal
court.
that
question
needs
to
be
answered.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
justice
o'connor,
our
reading
of
the
legislative
history
is
that
first
it
was
intended
to
apply
as
a
procedural
matter
in
federal
court,
but
given--
mr.
allan
r.
chason
--yes,
your
honor.
that
is
one
of
the
issues
that
we
have
raised,
and
the
brief
that
has
been
joined
in
by
the
attorneys
general
of
20
states,
in
which
we
join.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
i
would
admit,
justice
ginsburg,
that
there
are
difficulties
in
the
application
of
this
act,
as
was
fully
pointed
out
in
the
majority
and
dissenting
opinion
in
southland.
we
feel
like
southland
was
wrongly
decided,
and
i...
there's
not...
i
can't
say
too
much
to
add
to
what
has
already
been
said
in
the
amici
brief
which
was
filed
by
the
states
attorney
generals
or
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
justice
scalia--
mr.
allan
r.
chason
--justice
scalia,
the
only
thing
i
can
say
to
you
in
response
to
that
is
that
i
don't
believe
that
the
significance
of
southland
was
fully
appreciated
until
cert
was
granted
in
this
case.
now,
whether
that's
an
answer
to
your
question
or
not,
i
don't
know,
but
i
truly
believe
that,
and
that
was
the
point
made
by
the
attorneys
general
in
their
brief.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
yes,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
the
contemplation
of
the
parties
test
says
something
about
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
parties
at
the
time
they
entered
into
the
contract.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
if
i
understand
your
question,
justice
souter,
it
would
be
that
the
parties
contemplate
interstate
commerce
but
in
fact
there
is
none?
mr.
allan
r.
chason
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
your
question,
and
if
i
could
be
permitted
to
explain
why
i
don't
know,
i
can
say
that
we
view
the
contemplation
of
the
parties
test
as
an
attempt
to
look
at
the
practical
consequences
of
what
happened
in
the
transaction
under
inquiry,
and
to
give
effect
to
what
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
parties
were.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
the
notions
of
foreseeability,
your
honor,
are
not
foreign
to
our--
mr.
allan
r.
chason
--one
of
the...
one
of
the
objections
that
terminix--
mr.
allan
r.
chason
--not
if
the
test
is
objective,
which
we
say
that
it
is.
not
if
the
contemplation
of
the
parties
is
evidenced
by
the
contract,
as--
mr.
allan
r.
chason
--again,
we
get
back
to
questions
about,
what
are
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
parties,
and
what
could
they
foresee,
what
could
they
reasonably
foresee?
mr.
allan
r.
chason
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think
there
are
some...
the
contemplation
of
the
parties
test
is
a
judge-made
rule
made
in
1961,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
different
question
from
the
jurisdictional
question
that
is
first,
that
the
first...
that
the
court
would
come
to
first.
we
do
not
embrace
every
construction,
every
comma
in
the
contemplation
of
the
parties
test.
we
recognize
that
there
are
possibly
some
difficulties
with
it,
and
that's
the
reason
i
tried
to
answer
justice
souter's
question
in
terms
of,
it's
hard
to
say
on
a
particular
hypothetical
fact
situation
that
yes,
this
would
or
would
not
pass
the
test.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
well,
terminix
makes
that
argument,
your
honor,
that
a
practical
solution
to
this
problem
is
just
to
broadly
construe
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
the
statute,
and
then
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
tests,
and
for
practical
purposes
maybe
not
all,
but
almost
all
contracts
would
be
drawn
within
the
purview
of
the
statute,
and
we
don't
think,
absent
a
clear
congressional
statement,
that
that
was
their
intent.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
to
cover
transactions
like
the
one
here?
mr.
allan
r.
chason
your
honor,
my
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
that
i
do
believe
you
need
a
clear
statement
of
congressional
intent,
and
i
would
cite
your
honor
to
the
gulf
oil
v.
copp
paving
case,
which
i
believe
is
very
important
to
our...
the
analysis
that
we
would
urge
this
court
to
take
here.
that
case
was
decided
in
1974,
and
it
involved
section
2
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
and
we
don't
cite
it
to
the
court
for
the
statute
that
was
being
reviewed
there,
but,
rather,
for
the
reasons,
and
that
case
involved
an
asphalt
plant
in
california,
and
the
asphalt
was
going
on
interstate
highways
which
were
contended
to
be
instrumentalities
of
commerce.
and
in
the
copp
paving
case
the
court
discussed
that
those
were
merely
nominal
connections
with
interstate
commerce,
and
that
congress
never
intended
to
get
involved
in
those
kinds
of
details,
and
i
believe,
justice
souter,
that
the
copp
paving
case
can
be
read
as
holding
that
before
congress
will
be
permitted
to
get
involved
in
those
kinds
of
essentially
local
matters,
there
must
be
some--
mr.
allan
r.
chason
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
no,
your
honor,
the...
it...
as
i
remember
the
language
of
that,
of
section
2,
it
was
engaged
in
commerce,
and
the
court
read
engaged
in
to
mean
the
same
thing
as
in.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
yes,
sir.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
no,
your
honor,
we
don't...
we
don't...
we
rely
on
the
facts
of
bernhardt.
we
feel
that
this
court
would
need
to
overrule
bernhardt
on
its
facts.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
no,
your
honor.
we
would
not
think
that
affects
commerce
is
the
proper
test.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
we
think
it
was
right
on
the
facts.
we
think
the
facts
are
what
the
court
should
look
to,
because
the
facts
are
clear
that
it
would
have
been
within
the
commerce
power
of
congress
to
regulate
that
transaction.
now,
whether
that
part
of
the
test
was
dicta,
i
can't
say,
but
we
would
not
accept
the
test.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
i
can't...
i
can't
express
an
opinion
on
exactly--
mr.
allan
r.
chason
--the
answer
that
i
would
give
you,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
facts
in
that
case
speak
very
loudly,
very
clearly,
that
when
a
new
york
company
is
hiring
a
new
york
employee
to
go
to
vermont
and
run
their
plant,
that
if
the
act
reaches
as
broad
as
constitutionally
permissible,
that
transaction
must
be
regulated,
and
that
is
the
position
of
terminix
in
this
case,
is
that's
the
reach
which
should
be
given
to
this
act,
and
mr.
farr
has
admitted
that
in
his
statements
and
in
his
brief.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
if
i
remember
the
facts
of
wickard
v.
filburn,
justice
stevens,
one
of
the
relevant
facts
in
that
case
was
that
there
was
some
machinery
used
from
out
of
state.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
if
i
could
make
one
point
about--
mr.
allan
r.
chason
--if
i
could
make
a
point
about
the
legislative
history,
that
i
really
would
like
to
say
to
i
think
draw
the
case
into
focus,
at
least
as
far
as
the
legislative
history
that
terminix
relies
on,
i
think
that
it's
very
important...
we
don't
know
exactly
what
congress
thought
or
understood
about
the
word
1925,
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
we
have
these
two
cases
that
were
on
record
before
them.
we
also
know
that
in
the
subcommittee
hearings
there
was
a
brief
filed
by
julius
cohen,
who
was
the
principal
draftsman
of
the
act.
in
that
brief,
he
included
a
section
which
discussed
congress'
authority
to
do
what
they
were
doing.
in
the
brief,
he
used
the
words
"affecting".
he
told
congress
about
the
two
kinds
of
commerce
power
that
it
had.
he
explained
to
them
that
they
had
this
narrower
view
of
commerce,
and
that
they
also
have
control
over
matters,
i
believe
he
used
the
word
"affecting"
commerce
in
one
place,
and
"relating
to"
commerce
in
another
place.
at
the
time
that
he
wrote
that
brief...
and
let
me
also
say
that
after
he
submitted
that
brief,
there
was
a
house
report
filed
which
drew
the
same
distinction.
it
noted
that
congress
not
only
had
the
power
to
regulate
actual,
physical
movement
of
goods
in
interstate
commerce,
but
it
also
had
the
power
over
contracts
which
affect
commerce.
now,
at
the
time
that
that
report
was
written,
the
bill
covered
any
contracts.
the
original
bill,
the
language
of
section
2,
covered
any
contracts.
i
don't
know
what
happened
after
that
time,
but
i
do
know
that
congress
was
informed
of
the,
at
least...
i
can't
say
that
congress
was
informed
of
the
full
breadth
of
the
commerce
power,
but
i
do
know
that
they
were
informed
that
they
had
something
more
than
just
to
regulate
transactions
in
commerce.
now,
after
they
were
informed
of
that,
the
bill
was
amended.
the
bill
was
amended
90
days
later
in
the
senate.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
well,
we
don't
know
why...
what
they
were
worried
about.
as
justice
o'connor
wrote
for
the
court
in
the
gregory
case,
the
way
federalism
is
supposed
to
work
is
that
it
is
the
power
of
the
ballot
box,
that
is,
the
political
process
reigns
in
congress
when
it
tries
to
intrude
onto
state
affairs,
provided
the
court
does
not
do
that,
interfere
with
that
effort.
i
think
an
equally
likely
explanation,
justice
souter,
is
that
during
the...
this
bill
was
under,
had
been
filed
the
previous
term.
it
was
under
submission
in
congress
for
2
years.
now,
i
don't
know
what
happened
during
that
2
years,
but
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
an
equally
likely
possibility
is
that
the
people
in
those
congressional
districts,
or
in
those
senate
districts,
objected
to
the
breadth
of
including
any
contracts
in
the
bill,
and
that
it
was
amended
to
narrow
the
scope
of
what
section
2
would
do.
i
don't
have
any
concrete
proof
that
that
happened,
but
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
that's
just
as
likely
as
his
explanation
for
what
happened.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
would
agree
with
that,
but
if
i
could
explain
further,
if
you
read
the
legislative
history,
if
there's
one
thing
that
comes
out
clear,
it
is
that
the
principal
support
for
the
legislation
came
from
trade
associations
and
merchants,
and
people
who
would
be
in
the
flow
of
commerce.
i
cannot
imagine
that
in
1925
congress
intended
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
this
act
to
cover
transact...
spraying
insects
in
fairhope,
alabama.
sure
there
was
a
purpose
to
change
the
common
law
rule.
i
don't
deny
that,
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
answers
the
question.
the
question
is
over
what
jurisdictional
field,
or
what
was
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
the
act.
now,
our
principal
point
in
contradiction
to
the
one
that
terminix
has
made
is
that
we
know,
whatever
the
reach
of
the
act
it
was
something
less
than
affecting
commerce.
now,
exactly
what
it
was,
we
have
a
difficulty
defining
a
rule
to
describe
it.
now,
the
contemplation-of-parties
test
is
an
effort
to
do
that.
that's
a
judge-made
rule.
we
would
suggest
that
if
the
jurisdictional
inquiry
is
made,
and
once
the
court
gives
some
definition
to
the
term,
involving
commerce,
then
the
court
could
fashion
a
rule
or
a
test
if
it's
dissatisfied
with
the
contemplation-of-the-parties
test
to
properly
define
the
jurisdiction
of
section
2.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
i
have
not
suggested
one
exactly.
i
would
think
that
it
ought
to
go
something
like,
or
something...
it
ought
to
incorporate
notions
of
reasonable
expectations
of
the
parties,
and
foreseeability
of
the
timely
entering
into
the
contract,
and
not,
as
the
question
that
was
asked
by
justice
scalia,
that
the
validity
of
contracts
can
only
be
determined
ex
post.
that
can't
be
the
way
the
rule
works.
it
must...
whether
the
contract
is
subject
to
the
act
must
be
capable
of
determination
at
the
time
the
contract
is
made,
not
ex
post.
mr.
allan
r.
chason
your
honor,
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
have
all
the
answers
to
the
questions
of
exactly
what
the
test
would
say,
and
part
of
that
difficulty
is
that,
at
least
the
way
i
see
this
case,
the
first
question
that
the
court
needs
to
address
is,
what
is
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
the
act,
and
to
my
way
of
thinking
about
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
normally
what
this
court
has
done
is
first
determine
what
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
the
statute
is
and
then,
secondly,
try
to
fashion
a
test
that
will
lead
courts
which
inquire
about
that
in
the
right
direction,
and
we
feel
like
something
akin
to,
if
not
exactly
like,
the
contemplation
of
the
parties
test
would
lead
in
that
direction
if
the
court
construes
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
the
act
as
we
think
it
should.
