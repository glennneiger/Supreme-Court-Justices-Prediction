justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case
involves
a
local
termite
inspection
contract
made
in
alabama.
the
contract
had
a
clause,
requiring
arbitration
of
disputes.
the
respondent
bought
the
house
they
found
it
swarming
with
termites.
so,
they
brought
a
law
suit
in
state
court,
and
the
terminix
asked
for
arbitration,
but
the
alabama
courts
wouldn't
send
the
case
to
arbitration
because
under
alabama
law,
arbitration
clauses
like
this
are
invalid.
in
section
two
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
however,
makes
them
valid.
so,
the
question
was,
does
the
federal
law
govern
or
the
state
law
govern.
there
were
three
parts
to
that
question.
first
part,
the
people
who
said
the
state
law
governs
says
that
this
court
should
overrule
a
case
called
southland
which
held
really
that
federal
arbitration
act
governs
in
state
courts
and
these
people
said
no,
that
shouldn't
be
so,
the
state
law
should
govern
in
the
state
courts.
this
court
refuses
to
overrule
southland,
and
therefore,
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
applicable
in
state
courts.
the
second
question
concerned
the
meaning
of
a
word
in
that
act,
involving
commerce,
and
if
involving
commerce
has
a
broad
interpretation,
then
this
contract
may
fall
within
it.
we
felt
that
it
does
have
a
broad
interpretation,
and
the
third
question
was
whether
or
not
the
other
words
called
a
contract
evidencing,
like
it
has
to
evidence
commerce
and
does
that
have
a
broad
or
a
narrow
interpretation,
and
basically
we
held
that
these
words
evidencing
commerce
have
a
broad
interpretation,
and
basically
what
was
an
issue
and
functionally
is
some
people
argued
that
the
broad
interpretations
might
hurt
consumers
because
a
person
who
was
a
consumer
who
had
a
very
large
damage
claim
would
not
be
able
to
get
into
the
court.
they'd
have
to
go
to
arbitration
and
we
thought
that
probably
the
purpose
of
this
statute
thing
to
help
people
like
consumers.
more
often
a
broad
interpretation
would
help
them
particularly
if
they
had
small
claims
where
they
want
to
go
to
arbitration
rather
than
be
in
the
state
court.
so,
on
balance
we
felt
that
the
broader
interpretation
of
the
words
involving
commerce
was
more
consistent
with
the
basic
purposes
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
we
held
that,
therefore,
it
governs.
justice
o'conner
thought
not
to
dissent,
but
a
concurring
opinion
and
as
well
as
joining
the
opinion.
there
is
that
separate
opinion
and
also
justice
scalia
filed
a
dissent
and
justice
thomas
joined
by
justice
scalia
filed
a
dissent.
