mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
alabama
law
applied
by
the
courts
below
declaring
all
predispute
arbitration
agreements
to
be
unenforceable
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
embodies
precisely
the
sort
of
hostility
to
arbitration
that
prompted
congress
to
enact
a
federal
arbitration
act
in
the
first
place.
nevertheless,
the
alabama
courts
held
that
the
federal
law
did
not
apply
to
this
case,
saying
that
the
reach
of
the
act
is
limited
to
transactions
in
which
the
parties
contemplated
substantial
interstate
activity.
we
think
this
reading
of
federal
law
is
too
narrow,
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
best
reading
of
the
language
and
history
of
the
act
indicates
that
congress
meant
to
exercise
its
commerce
power
fully,
except
as
it
is
specifically
provided
in
the
definitions
and
the
exceptions
contained
in
section
1
of
the
act,
and
second,
the
benefits
to
commerce
that
congress
sought
to
obtain
through
enforcement
of
arbitration
agreements...
greater
certainty
in
dealings,
lower
litigation
costs,
fewer
litigation
delays,
and
ultimately
the
lower
cost
of
goods
and
services...
apply
to
all
transactions
within
the
scope
of
the
commerce
power,
not
just
to
some
of
them.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
1925,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
your
honor,
the
best
evidence
i
think
that
we
have
of
that
in
1925
is
first
of
all
congress'
own
view
as
reflected
briefly
in
the
house
report,
which
indicated
that
the
commerce
power
extended
to
all
contracts
relating
to
interstate
commerce.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
just
o'connor,
i
think
it
was
not
uniformly
as
broad
as
it
is
today.
i
would
certainly
admit
that.
however,
if
one
looks,
for
example,
at
the
brief
that
was
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
aba
to
congress
in
1924,
actually,
i
believe,
that
refers
to
a
very
broad
definition
of
the
commerce
power,
indicating
that
it
reached
not
just
matters
that
in
fact
involved
the
crossing
of
state
lines,
but
purely
intrastate
matters
that
had
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
justice
o'connor,
let
me
make
two
points,
if
i
may.
of
course
i
would
say
that
the
court
ought
to
give
meaning
to
the
words
that
congress
used,
as
i
hope
to
explain
this
morning.
i
don't
think
that
those
words
support
a
narrow
interpretation
of
the
act.
but
before,
perhaps,
i
turn
to
that,
i'd
like
to
make
clear
that
the
issue
regarding
the
construction
of
the
scope
of
the
act
overlaps
with
but
is
not
the
same
issue,
precisely,
as
the
issue
whether
the
act
preempts
state
law.
the
court
has
said
that
the
federal
act
does
not
occupy
the
field,
and
does
not
preempt
all
state
law.
for
example,
i
think
it
is
understood
now
that
state
laws
of
general
applicability
can
be
applied
to
arbitration
agreements
and,
indeed,
the
language
of
section
2
itself,
which
provides
that
they
can
be
provoked
on
grounds
applicable
to
any
contract
would
suggest
that,
and
the
court
in
the
stanford
university
case
indicated
that
the
parties
could
in
fact
incorporate
state
law.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
i
would
say,
without
knowing
exactly
the
details
of
the
transaction,
the
act
might
well
apply
but
would
not
necessarily
preempt
whatever
the
state
law
is.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
if
that's...
if
the
definition
of
the
law
is
a
very
narrow
law
that
is
aimed
at
arbitration
agreements
itself,
i
think
in
fact
it
probably
would
be
preempted--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--to
the
extent
the
federal
act
applies.
but
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
that
state
law
as
a
whole
is
not
preempted
by
the
federal
arbitration
act.
there
may
be
particular
state
laws--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
i
mean,
perhaps
even
rules
that
go
to
the
construction
of
the
contract,
or
rules
that
deal
with--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
let
me
try
to
use
an
example.
if,
for
example,
a
contract
was
signed
by
someone
representing
that
they
have
authority
to
sign
for
a
corporation
and
they
do
not,
that
can
be
applied
to
make
the
arbitration
agreement,
as
well
as
any
other
parts
of
the
contract,
unenforceable.
it's
possible
if
a
state
law,
for
example,
had...
a
state
had
a
law
that
said,
all
provisions
that
are
not
on
the
face
of
the
contract
must
be
separately
initialed
by
the
parties,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
one
could
say
that's
not
something
that
aims
at
arbitration,
not
something
that
is
intended
to
make
arbitration
more
difficult
itself.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
would
be.
that
would
be
preempted
by
the
federal,
no
question,
and
i
should
make
clear
to...
just
by
way
of
clearing
up
any
of
this
introduction,
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
there
is
no
question
in
our
mind
that
the
alabama
law
being
applied
here
has
to
be
preempted.
this
is...
the
alabama
law
that
we
are
talking
about
here
says,
we
do
not
enforce
arbitration
agreements
simply
because
they're
an
arbitration
agreement.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
i
can't
give
an
absolutely
clear
answer
for
every
case,
because
it
depends
on
the
particular
nature
of
the
state
law.
at
least
the
way
i
believe
the
correct
analysis
would
be
is
that
one
would
look
at
the
nature
of
the
state
law,
how
broadly
does
the
state
law
apply?
if
it
applies
to
all
the
agreements,
including
arbitration
agreements,
that
seems
to
me
it
puts
it
on
the
side
where
it
is
not
preempted.
if
it
applies
exclusively
to
arbitration
agreements,
it
clearly
puts
it
on
the
side
of
the
line
where
it
is
preempted.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
i
think
one
starts
with
the
language
of
section
2,
and
the
language
of
section
2
says
that
agreements
to
arbitrate,
within
the
field,
which
i
will
discuss
this
morning,
are
enforceable
save
on
grounds
that
are
sufficient
for
revocation
of
any
contract
and,
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that,
when
one
is
looking
at
state
law
seeking
to
be
applied
to
an
arbitration
agreement
and
seeking
to
say
that
it
makes
it
enforceable,
one...
the
first
inquiry,
naturally,
one
makes
is,
is
this
grounds
for
revocation
of
any
contract?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
from
arbitration
specifically,
i
do
not
believe
that
you
can
consistently
with
the
federal
act.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
this,
i
should
point
out,
is
not
a
statute
in
which
congress
has
made
specific
findings
to
which
the
court
has
to
defer
saying
that
we
believe
a
specific
activity
affects
interstate
commerce
and
then
directly
regulates
that
activity.
with
that
exception,
though,
however,
we
do
believe
that
the
correct
reading
of
this
language
in
fact
does
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
reach
all
contracts
that
are
within
its
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
the
word
"involving"
commerce,
for
example,
the
word
"involving"
is,
among
its
meanings,
synonymous
with
the
word
"affecting".
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
could,
i
agree.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
fact
is
that
if
one
goes
back,
i
think
one
cannot
fairly
say
that
the
use
of
the
word
1925.
i
don't
think
that
can
fairly
be
attributed
to
congress
until
sometime,
probably
after
schechter
and
perhaps
even
further
after
that,
in
the
late
1930's.
so
if
one
is
looking
here...
and
the
first
thing
one
notices
is
that
congress,
of
course,
did
not
use
the
word
1
of
the
act
at
a
different
point.
it
used
the
word
1923,
in
a
case
cited
in
our
brief,
united
states
v.
luskey,
at
least
gave
that
word
quite
a
generous
reading
in
another
context.
furthermore,
it
seems,
quite
frankly,
that
when
the
house
report
talks
about
having
relied
on
the
interstate
commerce
power,
it
talked
about
that
power,
as
i
mentioned
before,
extending
to
contracts
relating
to
interstate
commerce,
and
on
the
two
occasions,
it
seems
to
me,
where
the
court
has
given
some
indication
of
how
it
was
reading
that
language,
it
seems
apparent
on
both
occasion
that
it
read
it
very,
very
broadly.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
in
fact
it
did
read
the
language
broadly,
if
one
looks
at
the
inquiry
that
the
court
made.
it
said,
we
first
look
to
whether
the...
essentially
the
duties
this
person
were
performing
were
in
commerce,
whether
the
person
was
producing
goods
for
commerce,
or
whether
the
person
was
engaged
in
activities
that
affected
commerce,
which
is
precisely
the
test
that
we
think
is
the
right
test.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
the
contract
involved
in
bernhardt,
it's
not
clear
from
that,
there's
almost
no
discussion
of
what
the
facts
are
as
to
what
the
duties
were
that
the
person
undertook.
my
own
view
is
that
bernhardt
on
the
facts
would
come
out
the
other
way,
but
i
think
the
test,
at
least
the
inquiry,
is
exactly
the
right
inquiry
that
the
court
should
apply,
whether
in
fact
it's
either
in
commerce,
whether
it's
producing
goods
for
commerce,
or
whether
the
activity
affects
commerce.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
don't
think,
at
least
in
one's
that
i'm
aware
of,
that
there
are
decisions
about
consumer
contracts
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
when
you're
signing
the
contract
you
are
agreeing
to
arbitrate
your
disputes
under
the
agreement,
and
i
think
the
natural
presumption
is
that
you
are
in
fact
intending
to
go
ahead
and
agree.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
justice
scalia,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
fact
when
congress
includes
a
reference
to
interstate
commerce
as
a
jurisdictional
nexus
in
a
statute,
that
the
rule
frankly
is
exactly
the
opposite.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
federal
statute
in
which
congress
requires
a
nexus
to
interstate
commerce
for
jurisdictional
reasons
in
which
congress
requires
the
person
subjected
to
the
law
to
have
an
intent
about
interstate
commerce--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--in
order
to
be
covered.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
it
involves
contracts
which
relate
to
transactions
involving
commerce,
so
one
is
looking--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
agree
it's
a
possible
reading.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
really
don't
think
the
reading
makes
any
sense,
because
what
that
attributes
to
congress
is
an
intent,
first
of
all,
as
i
say,
to
require
some
sort
of
subjective
intention
about
interstate
commerce,
which
i
think
would
be
unprecedented
with
respect
to
any
federal
law,
and
the
second
thing--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--but
what's
lacking
from
all
of
that...
i
mean,
this
in
a
sense
is
perhaps
a
variation
of
what
the
alabama
court
applied
as
its
test
and
what
judge
lumbard
applied...
is
any
explanation
for
why,
in
fact,
congress
would
want
to
put
that
kind
of
limitation
into
the
act,
to
make
the
coverage
of
the
act
turn
on
what's
on
the
face
of
the
contract
or,
as
the
alabama
courts
would
have
it,
the
subjective
intention.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
that
assumes--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--but
that
assumes
an
intention
on
the
part
of
someone
who
is
signing
the
contract
to
say,
i
am
signing
on
the
face
of
the
contract
an
agreement
that
in
the
event
disputes
arise
between
us
we
will
go
to
arbitration.
however,
my
secret,
undisclosed
knowledge,
is
that
i
believe
this
to
be
an
intrastate
transaction
and
therefore
this
will
be
unenforceable
in
certain
states.
i...
it
makes
no
sense
to
me,
frankly--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--to
think
congress
wanted
to
pin
it
onto
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that's
correct,
but
in
a
way
that
seems
to
me
to
point
up
why
the
real
question
ought
to
be
whether
the
transaction
does,
in
fact,
involve
interstate
commerce.
i
don't
think
that
congress
wanted
people
to
be
able
to
enforce
arbitration
agreements
outside
what
congress'
power
would
typically
be
simply
by
making
a
recitation
in
the
contract,
so
the
question
would
still
be,
even
if
there
was
the
recitation
in
the
contract,
does
the
contract
in
fact
involve
interstate
commerce,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
test
ought
to
be
even
if
there
is
no
recitation
in
the
contract
about
what--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
i
mean,
the
contract
here
does
in
fact
show
an
agreement
between
terminix
international,
which
is
a
national
company
headquartered
in
tennessee,
and
the--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--respondents,
located
in
alabama.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it...
i
think
it
might
depend
on
what
particular
duties
they
are
undertaking
under
the
contract.
now,
here--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--if
they're
guaranteeing
performance
of
the
contract,
i
think
that
an
arbitration
agreement
in
that
should
be
enforceable
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
and
would
be
within
the
coverage.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
mean,
if
one
is
looking
to
this
particular
transaction,
i
mean,
it
is
a
transaction
of
relatively
modest
size,
i
suppose.
i
mean,
i
think
it
is
directly
within
the
flow
of
interstate
commerce.
virtually
any
test
you
can
use,
frankly,
i
think
reaches
this
contract,
because
it
is
an
interstate
agreement,
there
are
materials
moving
across
state
lines
in
order
to
perform
the
contract...
i
would
be
hard-pressed
to
say
that
one
contract
viewed
in
isolation
has
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
what
congress
is
requiring,
again,
when
it
is
using
the
term,
transactions
involving
commerce.
i
mean,
the--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
i...
no,
i
think
particular...
particular
arbitration
contracts
are
found
within
that
definition.
for
example,
congress
has
criminal
laws
that
apply
to
transactions
in
or
affecting
commerce,
and
the
courts
must
decide
whether
in
fact
a
particular
transaction
involves...
i
mean,
excuse
me,
is
in
or
affecting
commerce
based
on
that
standard.
now,
the
courts
apply
a
generous
standard,
assuming,
i
think
correctly
in
those
cases,
as
we
think
here,
that
congress
is
intending
to
exercise
its
power
to
the
fullest
extent.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
so,
in
the
absence
of
congressional
findings.
i
think
there,
the
relationship
by
any
of
the
normal
standards
that
the
court
applies
without
findings
would
be
too
attenuated.
let
me
point
out--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
your
honor,
i
think,
again,
it
serves
the
same
function
as
defining
the
class
of
contracts
that
congress
was
intending
to
reach,
just
as,
when
congress
uses
the
terms,
affecting
commerce
in
criminal
statutes,
it
is
indicating
what
particular
acts
and
transactions
it's
trying
to
reach
by
those
statutes,
and
if
one
steps
back
for
a
second
and--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
if
one
looks
back--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--the
congress
is
saying,
we
did
not
intend
to,
but
i
think
that's
important,
because
in
1925,
when
congress
was
enacting
this
legislation,
it
was
enacting
it
against
a
background
of
hostility
towards
enforcement
of
arbitration
agreements,
hostility
from
the
very
courts
that
were
going
to
have
to
interpret
the
act.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
oh,
i
think
there
would
have
been
a
very
definite
risk
in
1925.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
mean,
congress
was
very
concerned
in
1925,
and
i
think
judge
medina
says
this
many
years
later
in
robert
lorance,
that
unless
it
was
very
careful
and
put
this
on
sound
jurisdictional
grounds,
the
courts,
which
did
not
want
to
enforce
arbitration
agreements,
would
invalidate
it
as
beyond
the
scope
of
congress'
power.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that...
my
reaction
to
it
is
that
if
one
applies
the
test
that
the
court
applied
in
bernhardt,
that
that
would
be
found
to
be
too
attenuated.
that
is
my
position.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
in
the
absence
of
findings.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
because
this
one,
in
fact,
does
involve
interstate
commerce,
that
you
are
dealing
with
out-of-state
dealers.
i
mean,
this
is
not,
in
fact,
a
contract
where
one
has
to
say
this
is,
everything
about
it
looks
local,
does
it
have
an
effect,
it's
an
agreement
with
a
national
company
to
provide
services
to
someone
in
another
state,
and
that
seems
to
me
is
on
its
face
within
the
commerce
power.
the
question
posed--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
i--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--based
on
the
findings
that
congress
made.
congress
made
findings
and
then
regulated
a
specific
activity,
and
i
think
that
falls
in
a
different
category.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
just
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
first,
with
respect
to
the
contemplation
of
the
parties,
it
has
yet
at
least
been
explained
to
my
ear
why
congress
would
want
the
scope
of
the
act
to
turn
on
the
parties'
contemplation
about
interstate
commerce.
the
logic
of
this
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
even
though
the
parties
solemnly
agree
in
a
written
contract
to
arbitrate
their
disputes,
if
they
do
not,
on
the
face
of
the
same
contract,
say
something
about
interstate
commerce,
it
means
that
they
are
not
intending
federal
law
to
apply.
in
the
first
place,
i
don't
think
that
is
a
logical
inference
to
draw
from
it
and,
secondly,
i
can't
imagine
that
congress
would
intend
that
that
undisclosed
inference
be
the
basis
for
deciding
whether
federal
law
applied
or
not.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
one
has
to
look,
i
think,
at
the
reasons
that
congress
wanted
to
make
arbitration
agreements
enforceable.
they
had
several
thoughts
in
mind,
1)
that
it
would
provide
some
sort
of
greater
certainty
in
dealings,
but
in
particular
that
it
would
lower
the
cost
of
litigation,
it
would
lower
delays,
or
reduce
delays
that
were
associated
with
disputes
that
arise
out
of
agreements.
now,
what
you
have
in
this
particular
case
is
simply
a
contract
for
the
sale
of
goods
and
services,
a
standard,
garden-variety
contract,
one
that
we
believe
involves
interstate
commerce,
for
sale
of
a
service
involving
goods
to
a
citizen
in
another
state.
now,
what
is
there
about
that
contract
that
makes
it
inappropriate
for
arbitration,
as
congress
viewed
arbitration?
indeed,
the
legislative
history
talks
about
dealings
such
as
a
farmer
selling
his
potatoes
to
an
out-of-state
dealer,
and
makes
reference
to
that
clearly,
i
think,
suggesting
that
that
would
be
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
now,
this
may
seem
like
a
mundane
transaction,
if
one
thinks
of
interstate
commerce
in
some
grand
sense,
but
in
fact,
arbitration
in
contracts
like
this
also
can
reduce
costs,
can
reduce
the
burden
on
the
courts,
and
ultimately
can
reduce
prices
to
the
very
consumers
who
sign
contracts
like
this,
and
those
policies
clearly
apply
to
what
everybody
agrees
is
the
scope
of
the
act.
thank
you.
