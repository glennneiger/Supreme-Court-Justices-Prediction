unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
i
suppose...
now,
this
act
was
adopted
in
what
year?
unknown
speaker
right,
and
as
of
that
time,
i
suppose
we
didn't
have
as
broad
a
view
of
commerce
power
as
we
have
today?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
acknowledge,
though,
that
we
had
a
narrower
view
of
the
commerce
clause
power
in
1925
than
we
have
today?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
my
view,
as
expressed
in
the
southland
case,
is
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
do
more
in
this
federal
arbitration
act
than
affect
what
happens
in
federal
courts.
this
court
has
rejected
that
view.
i
still
think
that
was
correct,
but
faced
with
southland,
do
you
think
that
we
should
properly
give
some
meaning
to
the
words
that
congress
used
involving
commerce,
evidencing,
the
word
evidencing...
do
the
use
of
those
words
indicate
some
narrower
reach
of
the
statute
than
you
would
have
us
adopt?
there
are
many
laws
out
there
among
the
states
that
try
to
protect
consumer
contracts
from
having
arbitration
clauses,
and
preserving
the
rights
of
people
to
sue,
and
your
view
would
sweep
all
of
those
aside,
and
i'm
concerned
that
that
wasn't
what
congress
had
in
mind.
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
can
i
ask...
this
is
a
very
interesting
point
that
you're
making.
if
alabama
had
a
statute
similar
to,
say,
i
think
georgia
has
one
of
these
statutes
that,
there's
a
dollar
limit
and
they
exclude
consumer
contracts
of
this
kind.
would
you
say,
then,
the
federal
act
would
not
apply
here,
if
alabama
had
a
statute
like
that,
rather
than
just
a
100
percent
policy
against--
unknown
speaker
--where
the
state
law
says
certain
contracts
are
not
subject
to
arbitration,
certain
consumer
contracts
are
not,
how
could
it
apply
without
preempting
it?
that's
what
i
don't
quite
understand.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
the
rules
of
whether
the
company
is
liable
on
the
merits
are
not
preempted,
you
mean.
unknown
speaker
the
rules
that
deal
with
whether
or
not
the
arbitration
clause
is
enforceable
would
always
be
preempted,
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
if
the
state
law,
as
i
think
the
georgia
law
does
say,
said
that
for
an
arbitration
clause
to
be
enforceable
that
paragraph
of
the
contract
has
to
be
initialed,
even
though
nothing
else
has
to,
that
would
be
unenforceable.
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
may
i
ask
you
to
be
entirely
clear
about
this?
i
believe
that
justice
stevens
was
referring
to
his
position
in
southland
that
the
state
could
carve
out
certain
kinds
of
contracts
like
franchise
agreements,
and
you
have
given,
do
i
understand
you
correctly,
to
say
no,
that
can't
be
done?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that,
mr.
farr?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
conflict
with
federal
policy
is
just
as
severe
in
either
case.
whether
it's
sort
of
a
penalty
against
a
state
for
singling
out
arbitration
agreements,
i
mean,
as
far
as
the
conflicts
with
federal
law
is
concerned,
whether
it's
a
general
law
or
a
specific
law
addressed
to
arbitration
agreements,
it
has
the
same
result.
unknown
speaker
then
the
answer
to
the
question
i
posed
is,
you
cannot
carve
out
from
arbitration
specific
kinds
of
contracts.
you
can't
carve
out
consumer
contracts,
franchise
contracts,
particular
categories
of
contracts
to
exempt
them
from
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
given
the
language
of
section
2,
though,
the
key
language
seems
to
be
a
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
involving
commerce.
you
wouldn't
say
that
that
language
would
cover
everything
that
congress
might
have
covered
had
it
wished
to
exercise
its
commerce
clause
power
to
the
limit,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
certainly,
it
can
also
be
read
to
be
less
sweeping
than
"affecting".
unknown
speaker
"affecting"
has
been
almost
a
word
of
art
in
our
commerce
clause
jurisdiction,
whereas
"involving"
hasn't.
unknown
speaker
what
about
bernhardt
v.
polygraphic?
it
didn't
seem
to
read
it
very,
very
broadly
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
didn't
really
say
it
had
to
do,
it
said
it
did
not
do
any
of
those
three
things.
but
you
would
not
deny,
would
you,
that
that
contract
could
be
regulated
by
the
federal...
under
the
commerce
power,
the
contract
involved
in
bernhardt.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
the
way
justice
douglas
stated
the
question.
let
me
ask
you
this:
are
there
any
appellate
court
decisions
or
are
there
a
significant
number...
the
act's
been
on
the
books
now
for
70
years.
have
there
been
consumer
contracts
that
appellate
courts
have
said
are
subject
to
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
as
i
understand
your
proposal,
you
would
decide
whether
this
contract
involves,
or
whether
it
evidences
a
transaction
involving
commerce
ex
post.
that
is,
if
there's
a
contract
for
the
purchase
in
sale
of
widgets,
you
wouldn't
look
at
that
contract
to
see
whether
it
specifically
contemplates
the
transportation
of
widgets
interstate
commerce,
but
rather
you'd
look
to
see
what
actually
transpired,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
at
the
time
you
sign
the
contract,
you
don't
really
know
whether
it's
going
to
be
arbitrable
under
the
federal
law
or
not,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
one
side
can
be
rolling
the
dice
and
saying,
you
know,
there
is...
i'm
signing
this
standard
form
contract
that
has
an
arbitration
provision,
but
inasmuch
as
i
don't
intend
this
contract
to
actually
involve
interstate
materials,
my
contemplation
is
that
this
thing
won't
be
covered.
it
seems
like
a
very
strange
test
as
to
whether
a
contract
is
enforceable,
or
as
to
what
it
imposes
on
the
parties,
to
look
to
later
events
and
see
what
happens
later,
but
that
is
really
what
you're
proposing.
if
it
turns
out
that
the
contract
involves
interstate
commerce,
we
will
retroactively
say
that
federal
law
requires
the
arbitration
agreement
to
be
enforced
despite
state
law.
if
it
turns
out
that
it
doesn't
involve
interstate
commerce,
then
we
won't.
i
find
that...
i
don't
know
of
any
other
instance
in
the
law
where
we
sit
around
and
wait
to
decide
whether
the
provision
is
valid
or
not.
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
not
laws--
unknown
speaker
--but
they
are
not
laws
involving
contracting.
this
is
a
law
specifically
involving
contracting.
it
validates
and
renders
enforceable
despite
state
law
the
particular
contractual
provision,
and
you
usually
don't
validate
or
invalidate
contracts
ex
post.
unknown
speaker
more
precisely,
it
involves
contracts
evidencing
a
transaction
involving
commerce,
which
could
be
read
to
mean
that
the
contract
must
show
on
its
face
that
it
involves
interstate
commerce,
so
if
the
contract
says,
i
will
buy
and
sell
widgets
now
located
in
ohio
which
will
be
brought
to
me
in
pennsylvania,
then
it
would
qualify,
but
if
it
just
says,
i
will
buy
and
sell
widgets,
it
doesn't
qualify.
that's
a
possible
reading.
unknown
speaker
not
a
subjective
intention
at
all,
an
objective
one,
one
that
is
recited
in
the
contract.
if
it's
not
recited,
it's
not
there.
whatever
their
subjective
intentions
were,
we
don't
care.
does
the
contract
evidence
interstate
commerce?
if
it
does
not
evidence
it,
the
faa
doesn't
apply.
unknown
speaker
so
you
could
know
at
the
outset
whether
this
provision
that
you're
agreeing
to
is
enforceable
or
not.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
good
reason.
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
if
it's--
unknown
speaker
--if
it's
a
question
of
what's
recited
on
the
face
of
a
contract,
and
this
is
a
form
contract,
the
person,
in
this
case
terminix,
drawing
the
contract,
would
say
on
the
face
of
it
this
is
a
contract
involving
commerce,
and
i
guess
the
consumer
wouldn't
have
much
of
a
choice
about
what
the
contract
says.
unknown
speaker
why
did
you
say
earlier
that
it's
entirely
an
after-the-fact
determination?
there
certainly
were
elements
in
this
case
where
one
could
say,
i
mean,
the
company
being
from
out
of
state,
the
contract
having
been
purportedly
executed
out
of
state--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
farr,
if
it
were
in
all
other
respects--
unknown
speaker
--a
local
agreement,
would
you
say
the
fact
that
a
parent
company
of
a
contracting
party
is
an
out-of-state
concern
would
be
sufficient
to
make
the
act
applicable?
unknown
speaker
say
they
guarantee
performance
of
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
if
we
were
to
say,
as
we've
sometimes
suggested
in
the
antitrust
area,
that
the
contract
must
have
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
do
you
have
any
idea
how
this
case
would
come
out?
unknown
speaker
you
mentioned
at
the
start
of
your
argument
that
in
many
statutes
congress
makes
findings
that
the
particular
activity
affects
commerce.
actually,
the
result
of
your
argument
here
is
just
as
if
congress
did
make
those
findings
in
this
case.
that's
the
purport
of
your
argument,
is
it
not,
i.e.
that
arbitration
contracts
affect
interstate
commerce?
i
mean,
that--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
we
replicate
a
situation
like
wickard
v.
filburn,
where
one
farmer
in
ohio
agrees
with
his
neighbor
to
sell
him
50
bushels
of
wheat,
and
they
have
an
arbitration
agreement
in
it,
and
nobody
claims
that
the
wheat
ever
went
anywhere
except
across
the
local
road,
but
i
suppose
if
you
apply
wickard
v.
filburn
you'd
say,
well,
if
he
hadn't
sold
that
50
bushels
of
wheat
to
his
neighbor,
he
might
have
sold
it
to
somebody
else
that
might
have
baked
some
bread
that
went
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
is
that
contract
subject
to
the
federal
arbitration
act?
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
may
i
ask
you
a
related
question?
if
the
clause
in
question
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
an
implicit
finding,
what
does
it
add?
in
other
words,
why
is
the
act
any
different
with
this
clause
from
what
it
would
be
without
it?
because
if
the
act
did
not
have
this
arguable
limitation
on
it,
and
it
were
applied
to
a
transaction
which
is
claimed
not
to
involve
commerce
in
any
way,
that
would
be
the
defense
to
the
attempt
to
enforce
the
arbitration
agreement,
which
will
be
the
case
here.
so
if
it
simply
is
a
jurisdictional
statement,
but
it
is
not
a
finding
by
congress
that
all
arbitration
are
within
the
jurisdiction,
i
don't
see
what
function
it
has.
unknown
speaker
but
in
fact
unless
parties
attempted
to
apply
the
arbitration
agreement
and
to
enforce
the
federal
act
in
cases
which
clearly
did,
or
in
cases
which
did
not
in
fact
involve
commerce,
the
functioning
of
the
act
would
be
no
different.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
congress...
you're
saying,
in
effect,
that
congress
is
saying
to
the
federal
courts,
when...
and
parties,
i
suppose,
when
you
refuse
to
apply
this
agreement
to
contracts
that
do
not
involve
commerce,
you're
right.
that's
basically
the
function
of
the
provision.
unknown
speaker
in
your
judgment,
in
the
absence
of
this
limitation,
would
there
have
been
a
risk
of
facial
invalidity
to
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that's
what
they
were
guarding
against.
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
can
i
just
ask
you
one...
maybe
you
want
to
answer
it
on
your
reply.
are
you
sure
about
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question?
you
really
don't
think
that
would
be
enforceable,
an
arbitration
clause
in
the
example
he
gave
you?
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
before--
--but
you
think
that's
correct,
though?
that's
your
position--
unknown
speaker
--and
if
so,
how
do
you
distinguish
that
contract
from
this
one?
unknown
speaker
but
the
services...
it
isn't
where
the
service
is,
but
where
the
owner
of...
anyway,
i
won't
take
any
more
of
your
time.
unknown
speaker
then
you're
saying
it
doesn't
go
the
full
length
of
congressional
power,
because
the
chief
is
giving
you
an
example
of
something
that
was
held
to
be
within
the
commerce
power.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
farr.
mr.
chason,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
you
cite
the
case
to
our
honors,
i
think,
you
don't
cite
our
honors
to
the
case,
but
that's
all
right.
unknown
speaker
why
doesn't
it
involve
commerce,
why
isn't
it
in
commerce
if
i
contract
with
someone
to
bring
in
some
individuals
from
out
of
state
to
perform
services
in
this
state
in
spraying
bugs,
and
to
use
bug
spray
that
is
manufactured
by
that
company
in
another
state,
and
will
be
brought
across
state
lines
for
the
purpose
of
spraying?
that
would
be
involving
commerce,
wouldn't
it?
it
would
be
in
commerce.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--no,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
residence.
i'm
talking
about
a
contract
that
specifically
says,
on
its
face,
you
know,
party
a
will
send
from
pennsylvania
into
ohio
a
workman
who
will
spray
the
bugs
and
then
go
back
to
pennsylvania,
and
they
will
use
for
that
purpose--
unknown
speaker
--well,
sure
you
do.
why
isn't
that
a
contract
involving
commerce?
it
clearly
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
a
different
point.
that's
a
different
point,
and
the
point
you
were
making,
i
thought,
was
that
this
contract
did
not...
was
not
in
commerce,
did
not
involve
commerce.
now,
maybe
it
didn't
if
you
just
look
at
its
face,
but
if
you
look
at
the
way
it
played
out,
what
was
actually
performed,
surely
that
involved
commerce.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
tenuous.
i
mean,
when
you
spray
bugs
you
use
two
things,
you
use
people
to
spray
and
you
use
the
spray.
if
the
spray
is
coming
from
another
state,
surely
that's
a
contract
involving
interstate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
what
about,
wasn't
the
original
seller
of
the
home
didn't
say
something
about,
wasn't
there
testimony,
i
want
to
go
with
a
national
company
instead
of
a
local
company?
unknown
speaker
and
may
i
ask
you
what
you
make
of
this
court's
statement
in
perry
v.
thomas
that
the
faa
embodies
congress'
intent
to
provide
for
the
enforcement
of
arbitration
agreements
within
the
full
reach
of
the
commerce
clause?
did
we
just
get
it
wrong?
unknown
speaker
that
was
soundly
rejected
by
the
court
majority
in
southland
so
far
as
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
concerned,
any
concept
of
federalism.
it
was
held
the
federal
arbitration
act
applies
in
state
courts
as
well
as
federal
courts.
and
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
reach
should
be
different
in
federal
and
state
courts,
are
you?
you're
saying
that
this
agreement,
whether
this
case
were
brought
in
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court,
that
the
result
should
be
the
same
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
text
of
the
statute
doesn't
draw
any
distinction
between
state
or
federal
courts
if
it's
applicable.
is
there
some
different
test
for
one
where
suit
is
brought
in
state
court?
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
arguing
that
southland
be
overruled?
unknown
speaker
then
you
would
have
a
different
result,
if
that's
your
theory,
if
the,
say
gwins,
who
are
also
defendants,
if
they
moved
to
a
state
outside
alabama
so
you
would
have
a
diversity
case,
so
the
defendants
could
have
removed...
if
you
make
a
difference
between
the
substantive
law
applicable
in
state
and
federal
court,
and
the,
then
you
get
into
the
whole
mess
that
erie
was
intended
to
eliminate,
right?
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
square
holding.
it
would
be
sort
of
hard
to
overrule
it
without
upsetting
a
lot
of
reliance,
i
suppose,
upon
it.
there
have
to
be
a
lot
of
contracts
in
which
arbitration
provisions
have
been
inserted
with
the
full
expectation,
in
light
of
southland,
that
they'd
be
valid.
unknown
speaker
it's
precisely
the
kind
of
a
case
where
it's,
especially
in
a
field
involving
contracting,
it's
very
hard
to
go
back
and
overrule
a
prior
decision
without
upsetting
a
lot
of
reliance.
unknown
speaker
is
one
of
the
implications
of
your
position
that
it
is
within
the
control
of
the
parties
to
determine
whether
the
federal
act
is
going
to
apply
because
they
simply
can
be
explicit
in
their
original
contract
as
to
whether
they
understand
that
commerce
will
be
affected
or
implicated?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
their
statement
of
that
contemplation
in
the
original
contract
going
to
be
conclusive,
on
your
theory?
if,
you
know,
if
a
restaurant
owner
in
iowa
contracts
with
a
fish
supplier
for
lobsters,
and
they
put
in
the
contract
the
performance
of
this
contract
will
in
no
way
implicate
interstate
commerce,
does
that
control?
are
these
out-of-state
lobsters
you're
talking
about?
well,
i
left
that
term
unstated.
i
wanted
to
leave
some
sport
in
the
question.
[laughter]
is
that
provision
going
to
be
conclusive
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
federal
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
no.
i
was
thinking
that
they
would
like
to
live
in
a
dream
world
in
which
there
are
iowa
lobsters--
[laughter]
--and
in
fact
there
aren't
any,
and
it
might
even
be
suggested
that
no
reasonable
restaurant
owner
or
fish
supplier
could
so
assume,
but
they
put
that
in
their
contract
very
explicitly.
nothing,
no
implications
on
interstate
commerce
in
the
performance
of
this
contract.
is
that
going
to
be
conclusive,
on
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
reasonable
expectations,
then
i
suppose
the
answer
to
my
question
is
no,
that's
not
going
to
be
conclusive.
unknown
speaker
so
there's
no
way,
i
guess
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
there's
no
way,
i
gather,
then,
to
simplify
the
administration
that
your
position
would
sort
of
foist
upon
the
courts,
because
no
matter,
no
matter
what
the
statement
by
the
parties
in
their
contract
about
what
they
contemplate,
any
one
of
them
would
be
free
at
any
time,
i
suppose,
to
say
well,
that
just
wasn't
reasonable,
and
therefore
i
shouldn't
be
bound
by
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it...
do
you
agree?
do
you
agree?
a
party
could
always
wiggle
out
by
saying
that
just
was
not
reasonable.
unknown
speaker
then
isn't
it
much
too
easy,
in
a
form
contract,
for
the
party
who
is
writing
the
contract
just
to
put
in
anything?
we
contemplate
interstate
commerce,
and
then
the
person,
the
homeowner
really
doesn't
have
any
choice
about
what
the
contract's
going
to
say
on
its
face.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you're
going
to
go
by
what's
on
the
face
of
the
contract,
isn't
it
so
that
in
the
case
of
a
form
contract,
the
party
who
writes
the
contract
can
put
anything
they
want
on
the
face
of
it?
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
an
objective
test,
that
will
be
the
end
of
it.
the
contract
says
this
contract
contemplates
interstate
commerce,
and
if
this
contract
says
that,
then
what
happens
to
the
contemplation
of
commerce
test?
is
the
only
thing...
this
case
can't
simply
be
about
that
the
form
left
out
one
sentence.
unknown
speaker
but
it
should
be
easy
to
say.
the
whole
reason
people
enter
into
an
arbitration
agreement
is,
they
don't
want
to
litigate.
you've
destroyed
arbitration
agreements
of
all
of
their
value
if
you're
saying
any
time
you
sign
one
you're
going
to
have
to
litigate
about
what
the
reasonable
expectation
of
the
parties
was.
even
if
it's
set
forth
in
writing,
that
won't
govern.
we
need
a
lawsuit
about
what
our
reasonable
expectation
was.
you've
destroyed
arbitration
agreements.
unknown
speaker
you
need
a
clear
congressional
statement
for
the
proposition
that
congress
surely
could
not
have
intended
that
every
such
agreement
as
this
would
give
rise
to
a
potential
lawsuit
over
arbitration,
which
was
the
point
of
justice
scalia's
question.
i
mean,
do
we
need
a
clear
statement
from
congress
to
assume
that
that
at
least
was
not
in
congress'
contemplation?
unknown
speaker
or
any
transaction
in
which
there
can,
there
is
an
invitation
to
litigation
over
what
is
in
the
contemplation
of
the
parties,
or
the
reasonable
contemplation
of
the
parties.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
case
involved
the,
that
statute
deals
with
transactions
in
commerce
as
opposed
to
the
affecting
commerce
standard
in
the
sherman
act.
unknown
speaker
i
really
don't
think,
are
you
saying
this
should
be
read
as
in
commerce
and
excluding
everything
affecting
commerce?
unknown
speaker
they
same
point
they
made
in
the
bunte
case,
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
bernhardt
formula?
mr.
farr
said
the
formula
was
right,
although
in
his
judgment
the
result
on
the
facts
was
wrong.
do
you
accept
that
as
a
proper
formula
for
involving
commerce?
unknown
speaker
but
as
far
as
douglas'
statement
of
what
is
involving
commerce,
do
you
accept
that
as
a
proper
statement
of
the
law?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
the
court
got
it
wrong
on
the
law
but
right
on
the
facts
in
that
case,
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--it
was
a
declaration
of
what
those
words
meant
in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
the
perry
words,
that
that
was
dictum,
and
the
douglas
formula
was
wrong
in
bernhardt,
so
where
did
the
court
have
a
right
answer
in
the
majority
opinion?
unknown
speaker
well,
no.
he
says
the
50
bushels
of
wheat
transaction
would
not
be
covered.
unknown
speaker
well,
whether
that--
--that
was
not
recapitulated
in
my
hypothetical.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
the
case
isn't
famous
for
that,
anyway.
[laughter]
i
don't
recall
that
machinery.
it's
famous
for
what
the
chief,
how
the
chief
justice
described
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr's
answer
to
that
is,
they
were
worried
about
facial
invalidity.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
dispute
that
the
main
focus
of
congress
was
what
the
federal
courts
were
doing
in
rejecting
arbitration
agreements,
the
federal
courts'
hostility
to
arbitration
agreements
under
the
era
of
swift
v.
tyson,
when
they
were
declaring
general
common
law.
i
mean,
we're
way
back
in
pre-erie
days.
it
was
the
hostility
of
the
federal
courts
to
arbitration
that
was
the
principal
reason
for
the
federal
arbitration
act.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
second
choice,
other
than
the
contemplation-of-the-parties
test?
unknown
speaker
so
your
second
choice
is
your
first
choice.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
chason.
mr.
farr,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
