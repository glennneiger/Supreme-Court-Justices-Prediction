mr.
paul
bender
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justce,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
only
question
before
the
court
in
this
case
is,
as
both
other
counsel
have
said,
the
question
whether
edmonds'
definition
of
family
that
limits
the
number
of
unrelated
persons
who
may
live
together
in
certain
areas
of
the
city,
is
a
law
regarding
the
maximum
number
of
occupants
permitted
to
occupy
a
dwelling.
the
questions
that
were
raised,
have
been
raised
during
oral
argument
by
justice
scalia
and
others
about
whether
zoning
provisions
are
covered
and
about
whether
this
kind
of
restriction
can
constitute
a
discrimination,
are
ones
on
which
the
government
has
taken
a
uniform
position
and
ones
on
which
the
decisions
below
are
uniform.
there
have
been
no
decisions
in
this
court.
but
those
questions
are
not
in
this
case.
this
is
the
threshold
issue
of,
do
you
even
get
to
those
questions,
or
does
the
exemption
just
take
it
completely
out
of
scrutiny
under
the
fair
housing...
end
of
this
case.
congress
could
easily
have
written
this
to
also
exempt
this
kind
of
unrelated
persons
provision.
they're
very
common.
many
communities
around
the
country,
a
large
percentage,
have
this
kind
of
provision,
and
they
simply
could
have
said,
the
maximum
number
of
unrelated
persons,
or
the
maximum
number
of
occupants
permitted
to
occupy
a
dwelling.
by
using
the
language--
mr.
paul
bender
--right,
and
this
clearly...
those
maximum
occupancy
provisions,
the
language
you
just
used,
justice
stevens,
is...
are
terms
that
are
commonly
used
in
the
industry,
and
they
are
thought
to
refer
to
the
kind
of
thing
that
edmonds
has
and
most
communities
have.
edmonds,
i
think,
is
that
for
each
person
in
a
bedroom
you
need
an
additional
50
feet.
it's
to
stop
overcrowding.
it's
for
health
and
safety
reasons.
they're
overcrowding
provisions.
they're
density
provisions.
they're
maximum
occupancy
provisions.
that's
clearly
what
this
was
intended
to
refer
to.
we
don't
think
there's
any
need
to
look
at
the
legislative
history,
but
if
you
do
look
at
the
legislative
history,
it's
entirely
clear
as
well,
because
the
only
reason...
this
exemption
came
into
the
statute
along
with,
in
1988,
along
with
the
prohibitions
on
discrimination
against
the
handicapped
and
discrimination
on
grounds
of
family
status.
it
wasn't
in
there
before,
and
the
reason
it's
in
there
is
because
it
was
feared
that
without
this
kind
of
exemption
people
with
large
families
who
sought
to
live
in
small
apartments
so
that
they
would
have
five
or
six
people
in
a
bedroom,
when
told
you
can't
do
that
because
the
bedroom
isn't
large
enough
for
five
or
six
people,
would
say,
but
you
can't
tell
us
that,
because
that
would
be
a
discrimination
against
us
on
grounds
of
family
status,
and
this
was
put
in
there
to
make
sure
that
people
could
not
use
the
housing
act
to
insulate
themselves,
to
immunize
themselves
against
their
violation
of
health
and
safety
regulations.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i...
we
do
not
take
that
position.
mr.
paul
bender
we
think
it
applies
to
the
entire
statute.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
we
do
not
rely
on
the
legislative
history
to
tell
us
what
this
exemption
means.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
and--
mr.
paul
bender
--right,
and
i
think...
if
you
think
about
it,
try
to
think
of,
are
there
other
provisions
of
the
housing
act
that
people
might
use
to
defend
themselves
against
overcrowding
limitations,
and
it's
a
stretch
to
think
of
them,
but
it
would
be
possible.
somebody
might
say,
somebody...
a
member
of
a
minority
group
with
a
large
family
might
say,
large
families
are
more
prevalent
in
minority
groups
than
anywhere
else,
and
therefore
you
can't
use
your
overcrowding
limitation
against
me,
because
it
has
a
discriminatory
impact.
the
housing
act,
remember,
includes
discriminatory
impact.
it's
not--
mr.
paul
bender
--that,
too.
mr.
paul
bender
so
that
i
think
if
somebody
tried
to
use
the
handicapped
provision
or
the
race
discrimination
provision,
or
perhaps
a
religion
would
say
that
people
should
have
very
large
families,
and
somebody
would
say
well,
my
religion
tells
me
i
have
to
have
all
these
children,
and
i
can't
afford
a
larger
apartment,
and
therefore
i'm
entitled
to
violate
the
overcrowding
provisions.
i
think
congress
meant
to
say
you
couldn't
use
that
provision
of
the
statute,
either,
and
that's
because
they
thought
that
these
overcrowding
provisions
and
the
debates
in
congress
are
full
of
this,
that
these
overcrowding
provisions
are
so
important,
because
they
relate
to
disease,
they
relate
to
fire,
they
relate
to
epidemics,
those
kinds
of
things.
they're
so
important
that
they
should
not
be
trumked.
they
should
not
be
overruled.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
right,
and
the
reason
is
so
strong
that
it
overcomes
the
effects
protection
on
discrimination
against
any
of
these,
handicapped
or
others,
if
it
applies.
and
i
think
that's
also
important,
that
principle
is
also
important
whether
you
look
to
see
whether
the
city's
view
in
this
case
is
tenable,
is
being
consistent
with
congress'
purpose
and
i
think,
as
has
been
said,
it's
not,
because
if
this
ordinance
were
permitted
to
come
within
the
exception,
that
would
mean
that
cities
could
fence
out
handicapped
people
from
living
in
certain
areas
of
the
city
in
those
circumstances
where
handicapped
people
needed
to
live
in
congregate
living
arrangements
in
order
to
be
able
to
live.
no
more
than
one
would
say
that
a
city
could,
through
a
no-animals
rule,
or
a
no-pets
rule,
fence
out
blind
people
from
living
in
that
part
of
the
city
because
they
need
to
have
a
guide
dog,
would
congress
have
wanted
to
say
that
cities
can
say,
handicapped
people
who
need
congregate
living
arrangements...
and
there
are
lots
of
groups
of
handicapped
that
do.
the
elderly
handicapped,
for
example,
mentally
retarded
people,
aids
victims,
often
need
to
live
in
these
arrangements.
they
need
the
support
of
a
minimum
number
of
people
in
order
to
be
able
to
live,
especially
with
economic
factors
that
mean
that
they
have
to
share
the
costs,
and
so
they
need
a
minimum
number
of
people
to
get
the
sufficient--
mr.
paul
bender
--that's
basically
the
same
as
this.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
i
think--
mr.
paul
bender
--that's
slightly
different.
if
there
were
something
about
extraordinary
situations,
and
it
indicated
what
those
extraordinary
situations
were,
and
they
were
fairly
limited--
mr.
paul
bender
--it
would
be--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
basic
rule,
justice
scalia,
i
think
is
you
have
to
be
able
to
look
at
the
ordinance
and
see
a
limit
on
the
maximum
number
of
occupants,
and
the
reason
why
we
think
that
is
because
the
reason
for
this
exception
was
to
permit
local
and
state
and
federal
laws
that
limited
occupancy
for
reasons
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
what
kind
of
occupants
they
are.
they
have
to
do
with
overcrowding,
and
so
as
long
as
the
ordinance
doesn't
deal
with
overcrowding,
it
doesn't
come
within
this
exception.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
look
at
the
definition
of
what's
family
in
the
edmonds
ordinance.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
anybody
who's
genetically
related.
mr.
paul
bender
it's--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
i
don't
think
it
deals
with
overcrowd...
it's
overcrowding
of
the
dwelling
that
this
is
concerned
with,
not
with
overcrowding
of
the
area.
i
think
that's
quite
clear
in
the
exception
itself.
it's
a
maximum
number
of
occupants
permitted
to
occupy
a
dwelling,
not
the
maximum
density
of
occupants
in
the
neighborhood.
that's
not
within
the
meaning
of
this.
and
also,
it's
not
only
families.
you
could
have
the...
you
could
have
the
oxford
house
here--
mr.
paul
bender
--no.
mr.
paul
bender
if...
i
don't
understand
the
question.
under
the
edmonds
ordinance
you
can
have
a
family
and
up
to
five
unrelated
people,
but
a
family
can
be
infinitely
large.
remember,
a
family
is
not
defined
here
as
parents
and
children,
or
even
parents,
children,
and
grandchildren.
it's
anyone
genetically
related.
we
don't
know
what
that
means.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
it.
but
you
could
have
five...
three
sisters
and
two
brothers,
each
of
whom
are
married,
who
get
together
in
a
congregate
living
arrangement.
apparently,
they
could
live
in
a
house,
and
then
you
could
have
a
house
exactly
the
same
size
next
to
it,
and
the
10
people
in
the
edmonds
oxford...
in
oxford
edmonds
house
could
not
live
there.
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
congress
intended
to
prohibit
by
the
fair
housing
act,
and
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
would
be
permitted
if
this
ordinance
came
within
this
exception.
if
there
are
no
other
questions--
