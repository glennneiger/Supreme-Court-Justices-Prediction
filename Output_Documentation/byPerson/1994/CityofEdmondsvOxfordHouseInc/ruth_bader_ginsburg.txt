justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
a
provision
of
the
federal
fair
housing
act.
the
provision
totally
exempts
from
the
act’s
requirements,
reasonable
restrictions
regarding
the
maximum
number
of
occupants
permitted
to
occupy
a
dwelling.
the
parties
disagree
on
the
breadth
of
that
total
exemption
and
so
do
the
federal
courts
of
appeals.
the
dispute
before
us
involves
oxford
house
which
operates
in
the
city
of
edmonds,
state
of
washington,
a
group
home
housing
10-12
persons
recovering
from
alcoholism
or
drug
addition.
the
group
home
is
located
in
a
neighborhood
zone
for
single
family
dwellings.
the
city
of
edmonds
zoning
code
defines
a
family
as
related
persons
without
regard
to
number
or
five
or
fewer
unrelated
persons.
because
the
occupants
of
oxford
house
are
not
related,
the
city
charged
that
the
group
home
violated
its
zoning
code.
oxford
house
asserts
that
its
home
in
edmonds
is
sheltered
by
the
fair
housing
act
which
prohibits
discrimination
against
persons
with
handicaps,
recovering
drug
addicts
and
alcoholics
it
is
undisputed
here,
qualify
as
handicap
persons
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
court
of
first
instance,
a
federal
district
court
in
the
state
of
washington
agreed
with
the
city
of
edmonds
it
ruled
that
the
provision
of
the
city’s
zoning
code
defining
family
restricted
the
maximum
number
of
occupants
for
dwelling
and
was
therefore
exempt
from
fair
housing
act
governance
but
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
that
determination.
we
granted
review
to
settle
the
conflict
illustrated
by
the
diverse
decisions
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
today
that
the
fair
housing
act
exemption
for
rules
setting
the
maximum
number
of
occupants
for
dwelling
does
not
sort
the
edmond’s
zoning
code
definition
of
family.
that
definition
describes
who
may
compose
a
family
unit?
it
does
not
prescribe
the
maximum
number
of
occupants
a
dwelling
may
house.
rules
of
the
later
kind
set
absolute
feelings,
total
occupancy
limits
not
in
relation
to
families
but
in
order
to
prevent
over
crowing
in
dwellings.
concluding
that
the
city
of
edmonds’
zoning
code
rule
defining
families
does
not
qualify
for
the
fair
housing
acts
absolute
exemption,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
joined.
