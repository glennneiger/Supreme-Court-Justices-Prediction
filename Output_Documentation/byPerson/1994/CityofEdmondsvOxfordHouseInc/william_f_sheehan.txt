mr.
william
f.
sheehan
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--yes,
i
will
indeed.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
can
start
with
that
question
initially,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it
may
be
the
same
question
that's
on
the
mind
of
some
of
the
other
justices.
we
contend...
you'll
understand
that
i'm
now
jumping
ahead
to
the
merits
of
the
argument
that
we
will
make
if
we
prevail
here
on
remand
in
the
lower
courts.
we
contend
that
the
statute
requires
a
reasonable
accommodation--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--yes.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
that
is
exactly
right.
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
opinion
said
so
expressly.
we
will
contend,
if
we
prevail
here,
on
remand
we
will
contend
that
the
city
will
discriminate
against
us
if
it
refuses
to
make,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
a
reasonable
accommodation
in
rules,
policies,
practices,
or
services.
we
believe
that
local
zoning
ordinances
fall
within
the
language
of
rules,
policies,
practices,
or
services,
and
so
do
the
half-dozen
decisions
cited
at
footnote
7
of
our
brief,
including
decisions
out
of
the
tenth
and
the
third
circuits.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
none
from
this
court.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
we
will
contend
that
the
effect
of
the
city's
law
is
to
work
a
discrimination
that
is
prohibited
by
the
statute.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
have--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--refers
zoning
matters
to
the
attorney
general--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--yes,
it
does,
your
honor,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
think
zoning
ordinances
are
covered
by
the
act,
because
cases
involving
the
legality
of
zoning
ordinances
are
referred
to
the
attorney
general,
and
the
legislative
history,
i'm
reading
from
page
148
of
the
joint
appendix,
provides...
states
that
the
committee
intends
that
the
prohibition
against
discrimination
against
those
with
handicaps
apply
to
zoning
decisions
and
practices.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
that
was
a
house
committee
report,
your
honor.
in
1988--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
in
1988,
congress
extended
the
fair
housing
act
to
handicapped
persons
congress
knew
must
live
in
group
homes
in
residential
areas.
if
the
city's
construction
of
the
statute
is
correct,
it
means
that
all
local
governments
across
the
country
can
entirely
exclude
all
group
homes
entirely
from
their
cities.
now,
that
is
true
not
only
for
single
family
zoning,
but
it's
for
multifamily
zones
as
well.
all
group
homes
for
handicapped
can
be
excluded.
the
city
takes
the
position
that
its
ordinance
comes
within
the
exemption
because
it's
constitutional.
so
was
the
ordinance
in
the
village
of
belle
terre
case,
which
defined
a
family
to
mean
two
or
fewer
unrelated
people.
if
the
city
is
correct,
every
local
government
can
adopt
a
village
of
belle
terre
ordinance
and
exclude
group
homes
for
the
handicapped
completely.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
the
statute
requires...
the
statute
exempts
a
restriction
on
the
maximum
occupancy
of
the
number
of
persons
who
can
occupy
a
dwelling.
the
city
construes
that
statute
to
allow
the
exclusion
of
all
group
homes.
it
would
be
remarkable
if...
in
our
view,
if
in
a
statute
meant
to
extend
the
protective
embrace
of
the
fair
housing
act
to
handicapped
persons
who
congress
knew
must
live
in
group
homes--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--it
was
wrong
for
several
reasons,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
it
construed
the
exemption,
as
the
city
does,
in
isolation
from
the
rest
of
the
statute.
just
yesterday
in
the
gustafson
decision,
this
court
said
that
it's
duty
is
to
construe
statutes,
not
isolated
provisions.
the
city
can
point
you
to
nothing
else
in
the
statute,
or
the
legislative
history,
or
its
purposes
and
policies,
that
gives
any
indication
that
congress
meant
to
exclude
group
homes.
a
second
reason,
your
honor,
is,
as
you
described
the
ruling
of
the
district
court,
and
as
you
described
the
city's
position,
you
said
that
the
city's
definition
of
a
family
does
provide
a
maximum.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
your
honor,
if
the
maximum
is
written
in
terms
of
the
kind
of
health
and
safety
restrictions
that
housing
codes
typically
impose,
a
group
home
can
be
excluded.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
no,
your
honor,
but
i
have
to
jump
ahead
again
to
the
merits
to
say
why
that's
not
correct.
an
80-story
group
home
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
reasonable
accommodation,
but
the
ordinance
that
would
be
subject
to
the
80-story
group
home
would
not
be
exempt
from
a
merits
review
under
the
statute
unless
it
were
written
in
the
terms
that
we
say
congress
meant
to
exempt,
namely,
proscriptions
on...
i
mean
to
say,
restrictions
on
the
number
of
people
who
can
occupy
a
particular
dwelling
based
on
health
and
safety
concerns
related
to
the
space
of
that
dwelling.
our
construction
of
the
exemption
lives
happily
with
the
statute.
it
also
lives
happily
with
the
antidrug
abuse
act
in
which
congress
mean
to
promote,
to
finance
group
homes
like
oxford
house
for
six
or
more
people.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
what
makes
this...
what
makes
the
city's
ordinance
fall
outside
the
exception
is
that
it
doesn't
fit
into
the
language
of
the
exception
and
it
doesn't
fit
into
the
rest
of
the
structure
of
the
fair
housing
act
or
the
antidrug
abuse
act.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
it
does
not...
if
you
stand
in
front
of
a
house
in
edmonds,
if
you
walk
inside
that
house,
if
you
stand
next
to
two
identical
houses
in
edmonds,
you
can't
tell
how
many
people
can
reside
in
that
house
under
the
city
zoning
ordinance.
you
can
under
its
housing
code.
so
the
city's
zoning
ordinance
with...
looking
strictly
at
the
words
of
the
statute
and
thinking
of
nothing
else,
does
not
identify
the
maximum
number
of
people
who
can
occupy--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--well,
i'm
talking
about
an
empty
house,
your
honor.
if
you
stand
in
front
of
an
empty
house--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--no.
i'm
just
saying
that
the
city's
ordinance
may
impose
a
maximum
number
on
some
groups
of
people
but
not
on
other
groups,
and
it
does
not,
within
the
words
of
the
statute,
identify
the
maximum
number
of
people
who
can--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--it
does.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
it
does.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
that's
correct,
it
does.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
in
that
sense,
your
honor,
it
is
a
maximum.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
because--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--because
it
would--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--well,
your
honor,
the
district
court's
ruling
can
be
explained
by
its
refusal
to
consider
the
exemption
in
the
context
of
the
overall
statute.
the
ordinance
does...
the
ordinance
does
define--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--the
ordinance
does
identify
a
maximum.
it
identifies
a
maximum
number
of
some
kinds
of
people
who
can
live
in
a
dwelling.
it
does
not
identify
the
maximum
number.
the
ordinance
is
not
written
in
the
way
that
one
might
expect
if
congress
had
meant
to
exempt
a
zoning
ordinance.
it
sounds
very
much
like
the
way
one
would
write
an
exception...
i
meant
to
say
the
exception,
not
the
ordinance.
the
exception
is
not
written
in
the
way
you'd
expect
if
congress
was
intending
to
exempt
zoning
laws.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
your
honor,
zoning
laws
are
concerned
with
the
character
of
neighborhoods.
housing
code
density
restrictions
are
concerned
with
the
health
and
safety
of
individuals
inside
a
dwelling.
a
zoning
code
restriction
on
the
number
of
individuals
who
may
live
in
a
house
is
not
concerned
with
the
health
and
safety
of
those
individuals
inside
the
house,
because
the
restriction
applies
whether
the
house
has
2
rooms
or
20.
zoning
is
concerned
with
neighborhoods.
housing
codes
are
concerned
with
density
of
particular
dwellings.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
because
they
wanted
to
preserve
the
character
of
single
family
zoned
areas.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
no,
it
doesn't,
and
the
reason
that
we
believe
that
congress
intended
to
exempt
only
health
and
safety
related
rules
such
as
you
find
in
a
housing
code
is
in
part
because
of
the
origin
of
the
exception,
and
it
stems,
as
was
noted
earlier,
from
the
concern
that
large
families
might
insist
upon
living
in
small
quarters,
and
the
legislative
history
suggests
that,
in
order
to
allay
that
concern,
congress
enacted
this
exemption.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
it
isn't.
it
is
not.
we
have
not
contended
that.
i
understand--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--well,
if
in
fact
the
legislative
history,
if
we
were
to
rely
on
that
legislative
history
and
this
court
were
to
agree,
we
would
win,
so
i'm
not
shy
on
relying
on
it
for
that
reason.
i
just
think
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
argue
that
handicapped...
groups
of
handicapped
people
can
overcrowd
dwellings
and
cause
health
and
safety
problems
that
housing
code
restrictions
are
meant
to
avoid.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
i--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--no,
your
honor,
i
have
never
said
that
the
committee
report
states
that
the
restriction
does
not
apply
to
handicapped
people.
we
don't
take
that
position.
we
haven't--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
--it
does
not,
your
honor.
it
suggests
that
the
restriction
was
designed
to
alleviate
concerns
about
family
discrimination
issues,
but
it
does
not
say
that
it
does
not
apply
to
handicapped,
to
concerns
involving
overcrowding
by
handicapped
individuals.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
let
me
say
one
other
thing
about
the
way
the
statute
is
written.
we
have
cited
at
page
28
of
our
brief
a
model
housing
code
which
is
promulgated
by
the
american
public
health
association
and
the
center
for
disease
control.
this
is
a
model
housing
code,
and
it
says
that
the
permissible
occupancy
of
a
dwelling
"is
the
maximum
number
of
individuals
permitted
to
reside
in
a
dwelling
unit."
that
sounds
an
awful
lot
like
our
restriction.
