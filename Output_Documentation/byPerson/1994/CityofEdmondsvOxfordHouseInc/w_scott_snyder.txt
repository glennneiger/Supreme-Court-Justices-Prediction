mr.
w.
scott
snyder
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
court
with
one
question.
are
traditional
zoning
schemes,
which
set
aside
a
portion
of
the
community
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
family,
as
defined
in
accordance
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
exempt
from
the
reasonable
accommodation
requirements
of
the
fair
housing
act
amendments
under
section
3607(b)(1),
exempting
any
reasonable
local
restriction
on
the
maximum
number
of
occupants
who
may
occupy
a
dwelling?
if
congress
is
to
overturn
over
70
years
of
federal
deference
to
local
zoning
decisions,
and
to
limit
communities'
ability
to
set
aside
a
portion
of
the
community
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
family,
we
believe
it
should
be
required
to
do
so
in
clear,
unequivocal
language
stated
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
as
justice
marshall
stated
in
his
dissent
in
belle
terre,
zoning
is
the
most
important
function
performed
by
local
government.
the
city
believes
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
in
the
city
of
athens
case,
using
the
exemption
to
permit
a
threshold
inquiry
into
the
reasonableness
of
local
zoning
ordinances,
furthers
a
number
of
important
policy
considerations
and
meets
the
intent
of
congress.
first,
to
do
so
preserves
the
traditional
deference
which
this
court
and
the
federal
courts
have
given
to
local
zoning
decisions
and
legislative
decisions
allocating
portions
of
the
community.
secondly,
such
an
interpretation
prevents
the
fha
from
coming
into
conflict,
potentially,
with
constitutional
concerns
raised
by
the
amicus
pacific
legal
foundation.
third,
to
do
so
permits
the
federal
courts
to
continue
to
prohibit
exactly
the
type
of
discrimination
referenced
in
the
joint
committee
report,
that
is,
cleburne-type
discrimination,
in
which
groups
of
disabled
persons
are
judged
on
a
different
basis
or
subjected
to
differing
requirements
than
groups
of
other
unrelated
individuals.
finally,
using
the
reasonableness
standard,
as
opposed
to
the
reasonable
accommodation
standard,
prevents
the
federal
courts
from
having
to
make
inquiries,
individual
fact-based
inquiries,
into
the
individual
siting
decisions
of
group
homes
based
in
large
part
upon
the
specific
characteristics
of
a
particular
program.
we
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
in
their
decision
in
our
case
when
it
asserted
that
the
vast
majority
of
zoning
ordinances
would
go
unreviewed.
the
reasonableness
standard
which
the
court
has
applied
in
a
variety
of
constitutional
cases,
beginning
with
euclid,
provide
a
structural
review
of
zoning
ordinances
which
is
consistent
with
the
pattern
of
decisionmaking
of
this
court.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
the
fair
housing
act
amendments
accomplished
many
things.
for
example,
it
set
up
a
conciliation
and
review
process.
what
i
point
to,
particularly
in
the
joint
committee
report,
is
that
the
only
case
cited,
and
the
only
evil
described
with
respect
to
what
the
congress
was
trying
to
cure
with
respect
to
local
zoning
ordinances,
was
cleburne-type
discrimination.
cleburne
is
cited
twice,
both
in
the
general
comments
and
the
specific
section-by-section
comments.
there
are
other
things,
obviously,
that
the
act
did.
for
example,
having
the
conciliation
process
provides
an
administrative
structure,
potentially
lessens
the
burdens
on
the
courts,
and
allows
a
way
for
disabled
individuals
to
have
their
problems
addressed
with
the
assistance
of
hud
investigators.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
the
reasonable
accommodation
standard
is
most
frequently
discussed
in
the
comments
as
they
address
structural
issues:
exiting,
entrances,
stairs,
the
same
sort
of
barrier-free
removal
which
have
occurred
in...
through
the
ada,
for
example.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
i
guess
the
city's
position
would
rely,
perhaps,
on
a
stronger
point,
we
believe,
and
that's
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
itself,
and
particularly
the
exemption.
in
our
reply
brief
we
cite
rice
v.
the
board
of
trade
case,
which
was
a
situation
in
which
there
was
a
general
prohibition
of
a
certain
type
of
regulation,
and
then
an
exemption
created
for
reasonable
rules
created
in
a
certain
area,
the
breadth
of
the
exemption
itself,
which
refers
to
any
reasonable
local
limitation.
secondly,
this
court
and
the
federal
courts,
as
they've
discussed--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--excuse
me.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
correct.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
well,
i
think
there
are
probably
two
sources
of
law.
when
you
see
the
word
"reasonable",
it
implies
a
balancing
test,
obviously.
we
think
that
the
first
level
of
inquiry
in
terms
of
structural
review
would
be
to
resort
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
which
in
four
or
five
decisions
have
looked
at
local
zoning
ordinances
and
determined
certain
attributes
to
be
reasonable
in
a
constitutional
sense.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
that
would
be
one
of
the
standards.
again,
i...
the--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--yes.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
i
think,
as
i
said,
there
are
several
levels
of
inquiry.
the
second
level
of
inquiry,
probably
an
analogy
would
be
best.
there's
a
community
immediately
south
of
the
city
of
edmonds
which
is
comprised
solely
of
single
family
zoning,
but
which
has
an
identical
definition
of
family
to
that
of
the
city
of
edmonds.
applied...
the
same
ordinance,
or
the
same
definition
of
family
in
that
community,
would
work
to
exclude
the
disabled
from
the
community.
the
key
difference
in
the
city
of
edmonds'
structure
is
that
edmonds
affirmatively
amended
its
ordinance
to
remove
the
cleburne-type
discrimination
and
to
open
other
zoning
districts
of
the
city
to
group
home
use.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
i
believe
it
has
a
broader
significance,
looking
to
the
structure
and
history
of
the
purposes
of
zoning
ordinances
as
developed
over
the
past
70
years.
the
very
nature
of
a
zoning
ordinance--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--the
latter,
with
a
qualification,
sir.
i
think,
again,
reasonableness
implies
a
balancing
test,
looking
at
both
the
law
and
the
facts.
it's
not
the
depth
of
inquiry,
that
individualized
fact-based
inquiry
that
reasonable
accommodation
has
been
given
under
the
ada
and
other
statutes.
the
very
essence
of
a
zoning
ordinance
is
the
ability
of
a
community
to
distinguish
and
classify
uses.
an
ordinance
which
set
up
unreasonable
categories
would
be
exclusionary
in
that
sense.
an
ordinance
which
categorizes
on
a
reasonable
basis
is
definitional
in
nature
and
also
is
the
very
purpose
of
zoning.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
the
respondents
assert
that
because
the
uniform
housing
code,
which
the
city
of
edmonds
has
adopted,
is
specifically
mentioned
in
the
comments,
that
that
is
the
only,
the
sole
and
only
type
of
occupancy
limit
that
can
be
asserted.
as
we
know--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--yes.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
that's
correct,
and
i
think
that's
the
key
distinction
in
the
case.
three
reasons
or
examples,
i
think,
would
be
helpful
at
this
point.
the
uhc,
the
uniform
housing
code,
is
directly
mentioned
in
the
comments,
but
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
goes
on
to
use
"any
reasonable
limitation",
to
me
clearly
implying
that
there
are
other
reasonable
occupancy
limits
that
can
be
employed.
if
they
had
meant
to
say,
the
uhc
and
square
footage
limitations
they
could...
are
the
only
type
that
could
have
been
permitted,
they
should
have
said
so.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
in
addition
to
having
belle
terre
problem,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
it
is
asserted
by
the
government,
and
has
been
since
1990,
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
definition
of
family
in
the
city
of
edmonds
which
sets
a
limit
on
the
number
of
individuals
who
may
occupy
a
dwelling--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--is
in
violation
of
the
fhaa,
because
a
group
home--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--the
city
gladly
embraces
your
viewpoint.
[laughter]
i
think
that's
a
question
better
for
my
brothers.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
in
a
technical
sense
there
are
at
state
law
and
in
federal
case
law
very
clear
distinctions
between
rulemaking.
an
ordinance
typically
implies
an
enactment--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--i
have
not,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
i
think
that's
correct.
let
me
come
at
it
from
a
slightly
different...
let
me
agree
with
you
in
a
different
way,
if
you
will.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
i'm
not
aware
of
that
distinction,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
a
difficult
question
for
me
to
answer.
again,
the
context
is
so
much
different
from
what
is
presented
here.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
yes.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
that's
correct.
again,
3607(b)(1),
and
this
is
the
second
part
to
my
answer
to
justice
scalia,
sets
up
three
categories.
it
discusses
federal,
state,
and
local
limitations.
the
traditional
role
of
zoning
authorities
has
been
top-down
categorizations,
dividing
communities
into
districts,
categorizing
on
the
basis
of
common
attributes,
in
effect
setting
aside
portions
of
the
community,
the
basic
building
block
of
which
is
the
single
family
zone--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
correct.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
it
makes
it
a...
an
occupancy
limit,
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
simply
because--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--i
take
your
point.
it's
basically
moore
v.
east
cleveland
and
the
constitutional
limitation
on
the
city's
ability--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--it's
correct
that
it's
limitless
as
far
as
the
definition
is
defined.
as
the
record
shows--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
i
take
your
point.
i
would
also
believe
that
the
record
shows
an
associated
basis--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--as
written,
yes,
sir,
i
do.
i
think--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--i
think--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--i
think
it
would
be
a
matter
of
deference
to
the
traditional
role
that
local
government
has
placed
in
defining
the
use
of
lots
and
homes.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
that
is
one
evil...
or,
i'm
sorry,
that's
one
form
of
regulation
that
they
explicitly
indicated
they
wished
to
preserve.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
i
think
there's
a
danger
in
relying
particularly
on
the
comments
of
individual
legislators.
that
may
have
been
their
view,
but
if
they
didn't
have
the
votes
to
bring
it
forward
on
the
basis
of
things
in
the
statute--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--nothing
that
i
can
cite
at
this
time,
sir.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
the
city
does
not
rely
on
the
legislative
history.
we
believe
that
our
position
is
covered
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
as
written.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
if
that
was
their
intent,
sir,
the
statute
is
extremely
poorly
written
and
structured.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
yes.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
i
think
your
reading
would
achieve
the
purpose
that
the
city
looks
to
protect,
which
is
the
traditional
deference
of
the
courts
to
local
zoning
structures.
traditionally--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--if
that
was
the
intent
of
congress,
placing
a
general
exemption
without
any
limitation
as
to
section
it
seems
to
me
applies
the
exemption
to
the
fair
housing
act
amendments
as
a
whole.
it's
not
limited
in
any
way
to
the
specific
section.
it's
not
an
exemption
to
the
section
on
familial
status.
it's
an
exemption
to
the
fair
housing
act
amendment,
which
as
you
have
noted--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--that's
certainly
what
it
says,
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
i
appreciate
the
assistance,
sir.
[laughter]
the
traditional
role
of
local
governments
in
zoning
has
been,
again,
to
categorize,
and
we
believe
that
it's
the
interplay
of
the
uniform
housing
code
which
limits
square
footage
from
the
bottom
up,
looking
at
rooms,
bedrooms,
and
specific
square
footage
requirements,
as
well
as
the
traditional
top-down
role
of
local
government
to
set
aside
zoning
districts
and
regulate
occupancy
per
lot
per
building
per
structure,
and
the
interplay
of
those
two
specific
types
of
rules
and
regulations
work
to
establish
the
local
government's
role
in
occupancy
limitation.
state
and
federal
governments
have...
may
have
different
roles
depending
upon
their
specific
interest
in
a
subject.
again,
i
think
the
key
from
the
city's
perspective
is
the
70
years
of
deference
to
this
type
of
decisionmaking.
it's
very
difficult,
or...
communities
assign
and
create
zones
and
make
classifications
based
upon
a
specific
understanding
of
their
particular
demographic
nature.
as
the
record
indicates,
the
average
unit,
family
unit
size
or
dwelling
unit
in
the
city
of
edmonds
is
2.41
individuals.
the
five
or
fewer
unrelated
individuals
creates...
it's
basically
double
that
number.
it
creates
an
area
in
which
groups
of
unrelated
individuals
with
or
without
disabilities
can
come
together
and
establish
household
arrangements.
the
traditional
role,
as
established
by
euclid,
for
local
governments
has
been
to
make
those
distinctions
so
that
it
can
plan,
so
that
we
can
make
reasonable
assumptions
about
the
number
of
people
who
reside
in
a
neighborhood,
in
a
lot,
and
make
density
decisions,
thereby
planning,
sizing
water
pipes,
sizing
sewers,
knowing
where
the
locate
a
precinct
house
or
a
fire
station.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
i
believe
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
was
enacted
at
the
same
time
that
the
fair
housing
act
was
incorporated
into
state
law,
was
to
paraphrase
a
city's
obligations
under
the
fair
housing
act
amendments.
this
court's
assistance
in
interpreting
what
those
obligations
are
would
give
the
washington
courts
great
assistance.
there
is
no
case
pending
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
provision
has
never
been
interpreted.
as
far
as
mootness
goes,
as
long
as
there
are
damage
claims
against
he
city
of
edmonds
pending
with
respect
to
actions
which
may
have
occurred
in
1990,
3
years
before
the
statute,
we
believe
that
the
issue
should
be
resolved
by
the
court.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
well,
the
phrase
is
residential
structure,
which
further
confuses
the
issue.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
i
suggest
that
the
meaning
of
that
particular
phrase
in
the
state
statute
be...
that
there
be
deferral
to
the
state
courts
to
determine
it.
this
court's
ruling
on
what
the
city's
obligations
are
under
the
fair
housing
act
amendments--
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
--it
would
provide
direction
to
the
court
as
to
what
was
the
intent...
or
the
washington
state
courts
as
to
what
was
the
general
purpose
of
the
fair
housing
act
amendments,
remembering
that
this
provision
was
enacted
at
the
state
legislature
in
conjunction
with
an
adoption
of
the
fair
housing
act
amendments.
it's
been
incorporated
in
the
growth
management
act
for
the
state
of
washington,
rcw
chapter
3670a,
or
36a.70,
which
also
requires
each
local
community
to
annually
conduct
a
special
needs
population
assessment
to
determine
what
the
needs
of
the
disabled
are
in
each
community
and
to
plan
for
them.
now,
we
believe
that
that's
the
proper
role
of
local
government,
is
to
take
that
big
picture
approach,
determine
how
many
group
homes
require
siting,
how
much
of
a
community
needs
to
be
set
aside,
and
then
to
properly
categorize
those,
where
they
belong
in
the
community
based
on
a
neutral
criteria
as
to
how
many
residents
they
would
have
and
what
the
other
physical
characteristics
of
a
particular
group
home
are.
i'd
like,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
w.
scott
snyder
mr.
chief
justice,
two
points.
this
case
has
never
been
about
whether
disabled
persons
should
be
excluded
from
the
city
of
edmonds,
but
simply
where
within
the
community
they
should
reside,
given
the
numbers
and
institutional
nature
of
the
use.
we
believe
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
position,
or
decision
in
the
athens
case,
applying
a
reasonable
standard
and
looking
at
the
factual
basis
for
the
ordinance
structure,
the
overall
structure
of
the
scheme,
is
the
proper
way
to
approach
it.
it
protects
the
rights
of
the
disabled,
and
assures
that
they
have
a
place
in
the
community.
secondly,
we
believe
that...
as
counsel
stated
a
few
minutes
ago
for
oxford
house,
he
says
the
city
can
point
to
nothing
in
the
statute
which
supports
a
portion
of
its
position.
we
believe
this
is
one
of
those
legislative
situations
of
someone
trying
to
keep
an
elephant
in
their
living
room.
it's
simply
impossible
to
ignore.
we
believe
that
the
better
interpretation
would
have
been
that
had
congress
intended
to
overrule
traditional
single
family
zoning,
that
it
should
have
done
so,
and
should
have
done
so
on
the
basis
of
the
statute.
we
believe
that
there
weren't
the
votes
for
that,
that
had
this
issue
been
addressed
directly
it
might
not
have
happened,
that
the
court
should
look
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
and
determine
what
congress
did,
not
what
policies
or
programs
it
might
have
promoted
in
a
different
statute.
in
1990,
citizens...
pardon
me,
officials
of
the
city
of
edmonds
sat
with
the
hud
conciliator.
they
were
told
that
their
definition
of
family,
because
it
had
no
limit
on
the
number
of
related
individuals,
was
a
violation
of
the
fair
housing
act
amendment.
their
question
is
the
same
question
i
put
to
the
court
today.
as
they
asked
the
hud
investigator,
where
in
the
statute
does
it
say
so?
thank
you
for
this
opportunity
to
participate
in
a
unique
national
institution.
thank
you.
