unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
statute
does
nothing
more
than
impose
the
constitutional
standard
on
municipalities?
unknown
speaker
mr.
snyder,
i
may
not
understand
your
argument,
but
if
all
the...
if
the
act's
objective
was
limited
to
avoiding
cleburne,
or
cleburne
kind
of
discrimination,
why
would
it
also
have
put
in
the
requirement
of
reasonable
adjustment
of
the
zoning
ordinances
to
achieve
the
objects
of
the
act?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
the
reasonable
accommodations
are
just
as
you
put,
structural,
physical,
not
doctrinal,
certainly.
unknown
speaker
but
that
isn't
quite
right.
unknown
speaker
it
say,
any
reasonable.
it
says,
any...
doesn't
it
limit
it
to
ordinances
that
control
the
maximum
number
of
occupants?
unknown
speaker
so
at
least
we've
got
to
decide
whether
it's
that
kind
of
ordinance.
unknown
speaker
yes.
you
haven't
said--
--well,
it
says
any
reasonable
local
ordinance
imposing
a
maximum.
is
"reasonable"
determined
in
accordance
with
the
purposes
of
the
act,
or
is
it
reasonable
from
the
standpoint
of
general
zoning
laws,
or
do
we
know?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
reasonable
under
the
due
process
clause?
is
that
the
point?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
assume
that's...
that
must
be
assumed.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
any
zoning
ordinance
has
to
pass
due
process
muster,
or--
unknown
speaker
--so
that
doesn't
help
us
much.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
only
question
is,
does
2
of
your
brief,
do
we
determine
"reasonable"
with
reference
to
the
objectives
of
this
act?
unknown
speaker
if
it
has
a
broader
purpose,
does
it
also
include
the
purposes
of
this
act,
or
do
we
only
reach
the
purposes
of
this
act
after
we
have
found
out
that
this
is
somehow
a
valid,
reasonable
zoning
ordinance
with
reference
to
standards
that
are
outside
the
act?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
threshold
question...
maybe
i'm
missing
something...
that
it's
a
particular
kind
of
ordinance.
it
has
to
be
one
that
relates
to
the
maximum
number
of
people
that
occupy
the
property.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
exemption,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
have
to
convince
us,
and
maybe
you're
right,
that
this
is
such
an
ordinance,
even
before
we
decide
whether
it's
reasonable.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
edmonds,
the
city
does
have
and
has
adopted
a
provision
that
would
limit
the
maximum
number
of
occupants
based
on
the
square
footage
per
person
available
in
the
dwelling,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
the
argument
of
the
other
side
is,
that's
the
kind
of
ordinance
this
federal
law
refers
to.
unknown
speaker
and
not
your
definition
of
family.
unknown
speaker
so
you
concede,
then,
that
if
it
didn't
have
the
provision
for
five
unrelated
members,
if
the
definition
of
family
in
the
edmonds
provision
just
meant
individuals
married,
related
by
genetics,
et
cetera,
and
there
was
no
provision
for
five
or
fewer,
you
wouldn't
have
a
prayer
of
coming
within
this
exemption.
you'd
have
to
work
it
out
under
the
basic
thou
shalt
not
discriminate
and
thou
shall
make
reasonable
accommodations.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i'm
sorry,
i'm
so
far
behind
the
curve
on
this
one,
i
don't
even
understand
what
violation
you
need
an
exemption
from.
you
come
in
arguing
that
you
come
in
within
the
exemption.
what
is
the
violation
that
you
have
to
be
exempted
from?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
provision
does
it
violate,
is
what
i'm
concerned
about.
the
only
provision
i
can
find
is
the
provision
that
says
its
unlawful
to
discriminate
against
any
person
in
the
terms,
conditions,
or
privileges
of
sale
or
rental
because
of
a
handicap,
and
then
it
defines
discriminate
to
include
a
refusal
to
make
reasonable
accommodations
in
rules,
policies,
practices,
or
services.
it
doesn't
mention
laws,
ordinances...
i
note
the
government
in
its
brief
in
this
case
constantly
refers
to
zoning
rules.
i
never
heard
the
expression,
zoning
rules.
we
always
say
zoning
ordinances,
zoning
laws,
but
suddenly
there's
this
category
of
zoning
rules.
do
you
acknowledge
that
a
refusal
to
make
reasonable
accommodation
in
laws
comes
within
that
phrase,
in
rules,
policies,
practices,
or
services?
it's
a
very
strange
way
to
put
it,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
a
law
is
not
a
rule?
[laughter]
an
ordinance
is
not
a
rule?
unknown
speaker
in
the
general
category
of
rules,
do
you
think
ordinances
do
not
fall
within
that
category?
you've
never
advanced
that
rather
radical
suggestion,
have
you?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
point
was
when
you
get
so
specific
as
to
list
things,
rules,
policies,
practices,
services,
if
you
meant
laws
and
ordinances,
you
would
have
said
them.
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
some
experience
with
this
language
in
federal
legislation
and
accommodations,
let's
say
in
the
employment
area,
where
it
has
not
been
limited
to
something
lesser
than
law?
unknown
speaker
reasonable
accommodations,
say
the
notion
with
respect
to
religion
in
title
vii,
isn't
this
a
familiar
qualification,
that
you
sometimes
are
permitted
to
make
distinctions
if
it
costs
too
much
if
the
accommodation
isn't
reasonable?
does
that
just
exclude
the
realm
of
a
law
that
would
have
to
have...
a
local
law
that
would
have
an
exception?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
you
might
get
to
that.
you
say
we
don't
even
have
to
bother
with
what
this
provision
about
reasonable
accommodation
means,
because
we
are
just
totally
out
of
it.
unknown
speaker
we're
out
of
it
under
the
exemption,
so
justice
scalia's
point
might
be
a
live,
active
point
if
you're
wrong
about
the
exemption,
but
you
said...
say
this
legislation
doesn't
touch
us
for
reason
a.
maybe
it
doesn't
touch
you
for
reason
b,
but
we're
here
arguing
about
what
this
3607(b)(1)
means.
unknown
speaker
and
we
had
gotten
to
the
point
where
you
said,
if
we
had
as
the
definition
of
the
family
simply
related
people,
then
you
would
not
have
a
prayer
of
coming
within
this
exemption,
whatever
else
might
take
you
out
of
the
act.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
depending
on
what
is
a
tag-on
to
the
definition
of
family,
in
this
case
five
or
fewer
people...
in
belle
terre,
what
was
it,
two
people?
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that
that
little
tail
on
the
basic
provision
which
defines
family
is
what
gets
you
into
this
exemption.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
that
you
concede
that
a
requirement
that
persons
be
related
is
not
a
maximum?
unknown
speaker
it's
true
that
it's
not
a
knowable
number.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
because
the
statute
says
maximum
number,
and
definition
of
family
is
limitless
as
far
as
number
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
one
way
of
describing
a
numerical
limit,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
we
ascertain
whether
the
people
are
related.
unknown
speaker
and
that
sets
the
numerical
limit,
because
anybody
that's
not
related
takes
it
over
the
numerical
limit.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
do
you
think
that
this
is
a
maximum,
then,
under
the
definition
of
(b)(1)?
unknown
speaker
what
would
congress'
purpose...
i
can
understand
why
congress
wanted...
might
have
said,
look,
we're
not
even
going
to
go
into
a
local
zoning
rule
that
says
don't
crowd
people
into
a
single
house.
don't
take
a
little
house
and
stuff
10
people
into
it.
you
do
that,
you're
okay.
but
what
would
have
been
the
point
of
congress
wanting
to
exempt
from
all
of
this
a
law,
a
rule,
a
local
zoning
rule
that
said
single
family
housing?
why
would
they?
i
mean,
i
can
understand
why
they
would
have
wanted
the
interpretation,
don't
stuff
people
into
a
house.
unknown
speaker
it
means
that.
but
if
all
the
city
did
was
just
say,
we're
going
to
have
single
families
in
this
place,
whether
it's
one
person
or
50
people
in
the
family...
it
would
be
a
big
family...
why
would
congress
want
to
exempt
all
those
from
the
fair
housing
law?
i
mean,
from
the
handicapped
law?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
congress
wanted
to
do
that,
but
there's
quite
a
lot
that
suggests
that
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
give
way
to
antistuffing
rules,
if
you
like.
unknown
speaker
and
did
they
indicate
anywhere
that
they
wanted
to...
worried
about
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
else,
i
take
it.
there
is
nothing
else.
unknown
speaker
yes,
okay.
well,
i
guess
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
the
legislative
history...
the
house
report,
was
it?
then
you'd
have
to
say
that
the
whole
thing
is
only
limited
to
the
family
discrimination
provision
anyway,
and
not
to
the
discrimination
against
the
handicapped,
because
that
whole
thing
is
under
that
title,
as
i
recall.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
understand,
but
the
other
side
does,
without
bringing
in
with
the
legislative
history
the
limitation
that
it
was...
that
it
speaks
as
though
this
provision
only
goes
to
the
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
family
stats
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
handicap.
unknown
speaker
why?
it
seems
to
me
that
this
releases
a
town
from
certain
restrictions.
you
can't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
family
status.
that's
apart
from
the
handicapped,
isn't
that
true?
that's
one
of
the
bases,
proscribed
bases,
familial
status,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
this
whole
thing
seems
to
be
an
exemption
to
permit
you
to
discriminate
on
family
status.
the
first
sentence
takes
care
of
stuffing
too
many
children
into
a
small
apartment,
and
the
second
sentence
takes
care
of
keeping
the
kids
out
of
a
retirement
community,
so
the
statute
is
totally
logical
if
it's
looked
at
as
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
handicapped,
having
only
to
do
with
not
stuffing
too
many
children
in
a
tiny
apartment
and
letting
the
retirement...
letting
older
people
be
free
from
the
noise
of
children.
unknown
speaker
and
then
it
would
just
not
relate
to
the
handicapped
at
all.
you'd
have
to
make
your
case
or
not
on
the
basis
of
the
statutory
proscription
plus
the
reasonable
accommodation.
unknown
speaker
it
would...
my
reading
would
say
that
you
don't
come
under
this
exemption
at
all,
because
the
exemption
is
not
dealing
with
the
handicapped.
the
exemption
has
to
do
with
overcrowding
in
small
apartments,
too
many
children
in
one
apartment.
it's
an
exemption
that
deals
only
with
familial
status
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
second
sentence
certainly
is
limited
to
familial
status,
is
it
not?
what
does
the
second
sentence...
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
provision
that
says,
nothing
in
the
provisions
on
familial
status
apply
with
respect
to
housing
for
older
people?
unknown
speaker
your
response
is
precisely,
thereby
emphasizing
that
the
first
sentence
isn't
limited
just
to
families.
doesn't
that
make
it
seem
even
clearer?
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
what
edmonds
can
do
now,
it's
under
a
further
restriction
from
state
law,
from
washington
state
law,
and
i
would
be
interested
in
knowing
what
you
understand
to
be
the
command
in
this
recent
washington
statute.
unknown
speaker
whether...
one
thing
is
to
say
your
case
is
not
moot,
but
you
are
also
saying
this
doesn't
give
you
any
clear
state
command
for
the
future?
i
thought
that
the
statute
meant
that
from
henceforth
you
were
to
treat
handicapped
dwellings
the
same
way
you
treat
family
units.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
how...
what
should
we
do
about
that?
that
is,
what
is
the
appropriate
thing?
it
looks,
if
you
read
this
provision,
the
city
may
not
enact
any
zoning
regulation
occupied
by
persons
with
handicaps
differently
from
a
similar
residential
structure
occupied
by
a
family
or
other
unrelated
individuals.
on
its
face,
that
seems
as
if
it
means
that
you
can't
treat
these
people
differently,
because
they
have
handicaps,
than
you
would
treat
a
family,
but
it
might
not
mean
that.
that's
what...
so
what
should
we
do?
unknown
speaker
would
help.
how
would
it
help?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
snyder.
mr.
sheehan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
sometime
during
your
presentation,
mr.
sheehan,
will
you
tell
us
what
you
think
is
the
section
of
the
statute
that
makes
it
applicable
to
zoning
regulation?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
anticipate--
unknown
speaker
--it's
related
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
merely
held
that
the
exemption
didn't
apply,
and
they
did
not
reach
the
merits
of
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
the
rules,
or
discrimination,
or
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
so
all
of
that
would
be
open
on
remand.
unknown
speaker
none
from
this
court,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
more
than
that,
you
have
to
say
that
the
city
is
discriminating
in
the
terms,
conditions,
or
privileges
of
sale
or
rental
of
a
dwelling.
unknown
speaker
it's
law
is
a
privilege
of
sale
or
rental.
unknown
speaker
and
your
assertion
is
that
rules
is
meant
to
preempt
state
laws
and
ordinances.
unknown
speaker
even
though
a
provision
concerning
the
effect
on
state
law
is
much
more
specific
later
on
and
refers
to
state
laws,
and
even
though
section
36...
what
is
it,
3610(g)--
unknown
speaker
--(2)(c)
says
if
the
secretary
determins
that
the
matter
involves
the
legality
of
any
state
or
local
zoning
or
other
land
use
law
or
ordinance.
it
refers
specifically
to
law
or
ordinance.
unknown
speaker
did
the
congress
intend
that,
or
just
the
committee?
was
that
a
house
committee
or
a
senate
committee?
unknown
speaker
but
just
to
clarify,
it
is
your
position
that
there
has
not
been
a
first
view
on
any
of
those
issues,
so
the
only
thing
that's
here
for
us
to
review
is
the
interpretation
of
3607?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
every
local
government
could
adopt
a
maximum,
which
could
exclude
group
homes,
if
it's
a
maximum.
the
only
question
is,
is
it
a
maximum?
that's
what
the
statute
said.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
definition
of
family
for
the
city
that
we're
looking
at
does
in
one
sense
establish
a
maximum
number
of
unrelated
people
who
can
live
in
a
single
family
home,
and
the
district
court
judge,
judge
dwyer,
found
that
that
established
a
maximum.
the
ninth
circuit
disagreed,
but
why
was
the
district
court's
interpretation
wrong
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
mean
no
maximum
can
exclude
a
group
home?
is
that
your...
no
matter
if
the
ordinance
is
a
maximum
or
isn't,
a
group
home
cannot
be
excluded?
unknown
speaker
that
means
you
could
build,
you
know,
80-story
group
homes
in
otherwise
single
family
areas.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
tell
me
why
this
isn't
a
maximum?
is
it
because
the
family
definition
is
openended
as
to
numbers?
it
is
controlled
by
related?
is
that
what
makes
this
not
a
maximum?
unknown
speaker
does
it
not
fit
within
the
language
of
the
exception
because
it's
not
a
maximum?
unknown
speaker
well,
because
maximum
is
in
terms
of
occupants,
and
of
course
i
guess
you
can't
tell
the
number
of
occupants
till
you
go
in
the
house.
that's
the
way
it's
written.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
saying
you
have
to
be
able
to
look
at
that,
determine
from
the
outside
of
the
house
how
many
occupants
are
in
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
identify
the
maximum
number
of
unrelated
people--
unknown
speaker
--who
can
live--
unknown
speaker
--in
a
house
in
that
part
of
the
city.
unknown
speaker
and
in
that
sense,
it
is
a
maximum.
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
question
is,
why
don't
we
read
it
as
being
within
the
meaning
of
3607(b)(1)--
unknown
speaker
--because
it
does
establish
a
maximum.
unknown
speaker
i'd
assumed
that
you
were
arguing
because
of
the
legislative
history,
and
because
of
the
general
structure
of
the
federal
law
in
general,
but
if
you
just
look
at
this
provision,
3607,
it
does
appear
to
fall
within
it,
doesn't
it,
which
certainly
could
explain
the
district
court's
ruling.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sheehan,
some
of
us
are
having
trouble
hearing
you.
maybe
if
you
raised
the
lectern
a
little
bit
with
that
crank
over...
now
you're
lowering
it.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
looking
at
the
ordinance
for
a
second,
i
guess
we
have
a
normal
legal
animal
that's
difficult.
part
of
it
seems
to
have
a
maximum
called
five
unrelated,
part
of
it
doesn't
seem
to
have
a
maximum,
called
single
family.
you
could
have
a
little
family
or
a
big
family.
all
right.
so
then
i
guess
i'd
like
to
look
to
the
basic
purpose
of
this
particular
zoning
reg.
was
it
to
prevent
overcrowding?
was
it
to
do
something
else?
why
did
they
pass
this
reg?
what's
the
point
of
it,
or
the
zoning
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
say
anything...
what
is
the
concern
of
this
particular
zoning
rule
before
us?
why
did
they
pass
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sheehan
you
refer
to
health
and
safety
reasons
several
times
in
connection
with
the
ordinance
requirements,
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
it
says,
federal
restrictions
regarding
the
maximum
number
of
occupants
permitted
to
occupy
a
dwelling.
it
doesn't
say
for
what
reason
the
maximum
may
be
imposed.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
this
exception
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
a
handicapped
exclusion?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you're
going
to
buy
the
legislative
history,
it
seems
you
just
pick
the
portion
of
it
you
like
and
omit
the
portion
you
don't
like?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
all
they
had
in
mind
was
family
status,
so
if
you're
going
to
use
legislative
history
for
the
one,
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
use
it
for
the
other.
unknown
speaker
alternatively,
if
the
committee
report
could
be
so
mistaken
about
whether
this
provision
applies
to
the
handicapped
at
all,
then
it
may
be
equally
mistaken
about
what
the
provision
means
as
far
as
maximum
is
concerned.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you
either
buy
the
whole
report,
in
which
case
you
say
it
doesn't
apply
to
handicapped
at
all,
or
if
you
say,
oh
yes,
it
does
apply
to
handicapped,
then
you're
looking
at
a
committee
report
that
is
very
ignorant,
that
just
makes
a
botch
of
the
whole
thing,
to
think
that
it
only
applies
to
family
status.
unknown
speaker
it
says
that,
though.
unknown
speaker
i
will
get
it,
and
we
will
see.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
sheehan.
mr.
bender,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
true,
mr.
bender,
that
most
of
those
cities
that
have
a
provision
like
this
also
have
a
maximum
occupancy
provision?
unknown
speaker
but
the
government
doesn't
take
that
position,
does
it,
that
the
exemption
only
applies
to
what
it
was,
you
tell
us
it
was
intended
to
cover,
and
that
is,
the
family
status
provision,
so
you
didn't
have
to
bring
in
someone
with
eight
children
if
the
apartment
doesn't
have
room
for
eight
children.
unknown
speaker
well,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
then
you're
picking
and
choosing
in
the
legislation.
you're
saying
it's
authoritative
for
one
purpose,
it's
not
authoritative
for
the
other,
because
that
provision,
the
legislative
history
of
the
house
report
says
section
3607(b)(1)
amends
the
act
to
make
additional
exemptions
relating
to
the
familial
status
provisions.
unknown
speaker
and,
in
fact,
the
first
sentence
relates
not
just
to
the
familial
status
provision
but,
you're
telling
us,
to
the
handicapped
provision.
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
my
goodness,
no
one
would
ever
look
only
to
legislative
history,
would
they?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
they'd
look
to
position,
structure,
language,
and
legislative
history
where
it's
helpful,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
so
in
some
of
these
things
might
be
helpful,
but
on
others
not.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
they
might
say
that
having
a
large
family
was
a
handicap.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
vote
for
that
one.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
the
reason
for
the
overcrowding
provision
in
a
normal
municipal
ordinance
applies
equally
whether
the
people
are
handicapped
or
not.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bender,
is
it
your
position
that
any
numerical
limitation
that
has
an
exception
is
not
a
numerical
limitation,
because
i
mean,
you
know,
you
could
read
this
ordinance,
or
you
could
write
it
differently.
you
could
say,
no
house
in
this
area
of
the
city
shall
have
more
than
five
occupants
unless
it
is
a
family.
you
know,
make
that
one
exception,
so
it's
a
five-occupant
limit,
but
an
exception
for
families.
unknown
speaker
it's
basically
the
same
as
this,
and
you
say
the
exception
causes
it
to
not
be
a
numerical
limitation.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
say,
no
more
than
a
hundred
people
in
the
apartment
building
unless
in
extraordinary
situations
that's
necessary.
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
extraordinary--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
difference
here
is
that
families
are
not
extraordinary.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
the
single
family
limitation
basically
deal
with
that,
don't
you
think?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
deal
with
population
density?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--that's
because
you
don't
want
to
put
down,
you
know,
limits
on
the
number
of
children
people
can
have,
but
basically,
when
you
have
a
single
family
limitation,
isn't
it...
doesn't
it
deal
with
overcrowding
in
the
area?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
want
a
whole
lot
of
people.
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
matter
how
big
that
dwelling
is,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
can
only
have
one
family.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
bender.
mr.
snyder,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
