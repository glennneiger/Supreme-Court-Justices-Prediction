mr.
paul
bender
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
court
of
appeals
appellate
jurisdiction
which
the
court
inquired
about
at
the
beginning
of
petitioner's
argument,
under
the
position
that
the
government
took
in
johnson
and
jones,
which
you
heard
last
week,
this
would
be
appealable,
because
it's
a
question
that
relates
in
some
sense
to
the
qualified
immunity
defense.
under
the
narrow...
the
narrow
view
that
only
questions
of
whether
the
law
is
clearly
established
are
appealable
under
mitchell,
then
it
would
not
be
appealable.
i
think
there's
an
in-between
question.
the
thing
that
seemed
to
concern
the
court
most
in
johnson
and
jones
was
whether
the
court
would
have
to
look
through...
whether
the
appellate
court
would
have
to
look
through
the
record
to
see
whether
there
were...
whether
factual
issues
were
in
dispute
or
not.
the
ground
of
appeal
in
this
case
was
that
the
district
judge
had
failed
to
use
the
correct
direct
evidence
standard.
judge
green
had
interpreted
the
direct
evidence
standard
not
really
to
require
only
direct
rather
than
circumstantial
evidence,
and
the
ground
of
appeal
was
that
he
was
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
the
direct
evidence
standard,
as
the
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
on
the
appeal--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
agree
completely.
our
argument
in
johnson
and
jones
was
that
if
it's
a
question
of
law
related
to
a
qualified
immunity
defense,
that
that
should
be
a
different--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
our
argument
in
johnson
was
that
the
qualified
immunity
defense
is
there
to
protect
people
who
did
not
violate
clearly
established
constitutional
rights,
so
you
can
state
the
qualified
immunity
by
saying,
an
official
who
did
not
violate
clearly
established
constitutional
rights
has
qualified
immunity.
if
he
stated--
mr.
paul
bender
--yes,
right.
if
you
say...
but
that
depends
on
a
broader
statement
of
the
qualified
immunity
defense
than
is
necessary,
so
it's
really
a
question
of
how
you
define
the
qualified
immunity
defense,
and
also
a
question
of
whether
you
want
to
limit
appeals
to
the
question
of
law,
or
whether
you
want
to
expand
appeals
to
appeals
that
require
looking
through
the
record
to
see
whether
there
are
sufficient
factual
allegations.
this
question,
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
in
this
case
it
was
really
a
pure
question
of
law
that
related
to
a
rule,
that
is,
the
direct
evidence
rule,
that
the
court
adopted
as
part
of
its
vindication
of
qualified
immunity,
and
so
it's
not
just
any
rule
of
law,
like
a
statute
of
limitations,
for
example,
interpretation.
it's
a
rule
of
law
that
was
adopted
in
order
to
protect
officials
against
suits
in
the
area
that
the
court
feels
they
should
be
protected.
ever
since
the
court...
coming
to
the
merits,
ever
since
the
court
has
recognized
the
ability
of
plaintiffs
to
sue
federal
officials
for
violations
of
constitutional
rights
in
bivens,
the
court
has
been
concerned,
as
has
the
government,
with
making
sure
that
while
meritorious
suits
are
permitted
to
go
forward,
the
threat
of
litigation
does
not
improperly
interfere
with
an
official's
exercise
of
discretion,
and
the
actual
bringing
of
litigation,
the
burdens
of
litigation,
going
through
discovery
and
trial,
does
not
interfere
unduly
with...
in
insubstantial
cases--
mr.
paul
bender
--right.
mr.
paul
bender
our
view
is
consistent
with
the
views
of,
i
think,
seven
circuits
that
have
looked
at
this
question,
and
that
is
that
the
court
ought
to
adopt
a
standard
requiring
specific
allegations
of
the
basis
for
the
claim
of
unconstitutional
motive
before
you
go
to
the
discovery
stage
of
the
case.
it's
not
a
heightened
pleading
standard,
because
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
call
it
a
pleading
standard.
i'm
not
sure
the
federal
rules
permit
you
to
make
it
a
pleading
standard,
especially
since
rule
9
says
that
intent
can
be
pleaded
generally,
and
therefore
i
don't
think
it's
just...
if
it's
in
the
pleading,
it
satisfies
it,
but
even
if
it--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
rules
that
provide
a
basis
for
it.
one
is
rule
26,
which
gives
a
judge
control
over
the
discovery
process,
and
which
says
that
the
judge
can
consider
in,
i
think
it's
26(b)(2)(iii),
the
judge
can
consider
whether
the
burdens
that
the
discovery
is
going
to
impose
are
worth
it
in
light
of
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
need
of
the
discovery.
i
think
that
a
judge,
in
order
to
implement
this
court's
qualified
immunity
jurisprudence,
and
the
feeling
the
court
has
had
that
people
should
have
the
right
to
be
free
from
discovery
on
insubstantial
claims,
that
a
judge
could
enforce
a
heightened
specificity
standard--
mr.
paul
bender
--in
a...
yes,
in
a
clear
case,
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to,
right.
another
possibility
is
rule
7,
which
permits
the
court
to
order
a
reply
so
that
when
a
defendant
pleads
a
defense
of
qualified
immunity
in
response
to
the
complaint
either
through
motion
or
through
an
answer,
the
court
could
order
the
plaintiff
to
file
a
reply
to
that
supplemental
pleading
which
would
have
to
have
the
specificity.
it's
very
much
like...
as
justice
ginsburg
said
before,
it's
very
much
like
a
motion
for
a
more
definite
statement,
although
this
comes
from
the
special
concerns
of
qualified
immunity
rather
than
the
more
general
concerns
of
the
motion
for
a
more
definite
statement.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
you
can
do
that.
you
can
say
that
that...
the
plea
of
qualified
immunity
means
that
the
judge
should
require--
mr.
paul
bender
--again,
i
see
no
reason
why
you
could
not
do
that,
so
i
think
there
are
at
least
three
different
bases--
mr.
paul
bender
--yes,
(b)(2)(iii),
i
think,
which
talks
about
the--
mr.
paul
bender
--(b)(2),
and
then
there's
(iii),
which
talks
about
the
judge
dealing
with
the
burdens
of
discovery.
so
what
we
would
like
to
see
is
in
response,
and
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
this
is...
this
responds
to
your
question...
it
certainly
is
possible
for
people
to
just
say,
he
or
she
did
it
with
an
unconstitutional
motive,
but
if
you
have
a
requirement
that
there
has
to
be
some
specificity...
what's
that
based
on?
are
you
just
making
that
up?
are
you
just
imagining
that?
are
you
just
saying,
well,
he's
a
republican,
i'm
a
democrat,
therefore
he
must
hate
me,
therefore
he's
doing
something
to
retaliate
against
me...
that
wouldn't
be
enough.
you've
got
to
give
some
objective
basis,
or
some
direct
evidence
basis
if
you
have
it,
for
saying
that
this
was
something
that
was
done
with
an
unconstitutional
motive,
and
if
the
plaintiff
isn't
able
to
do
that,
then
i
think
there's
a
very,
very
great
likelihood
that
it's
an
insubstantial
case,
and
the
right
thing
to
do
would
be
to
dismiss
it
as
early
as
possible,
as
the
court
has
said.
i
don't
think
that's
an
absolute
rule.
there
may
be
some
cases
where
the
judge
would
be
convinced
that
it
would
be
proper
to
permit
the
plaintiff
to
do
some
limited
discovery
because
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case
it's
not
fair
to
force
the
plaintiff
to
plead
with
more
specificity,
given
the
circumstances,
but
i
think
those
would
be
extremely
rare,
and
i
think
you
can
leave
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
to
do--
mr.
paul
bender
--right.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
and
you
must
answer
it
with
enough
specificity
to
justify
going
forward,
and
i
think
you're
right
that
that
comes
from
the
desire
of
the
defense
of
qualified
immunity
to
not
have
people
forced
to
go
through
discovery
on
insubstantial
claims,
and
that
it
is
worthwhile
testing
whether
the
claim
is
substantial
or
not
as
early
in
the
process
as
possible
by
that
kind
of
automatic
motion
for
a
more
definite
statement,
yes.
the
direct
evidence
rule,
on
the
other
hand,
we
agree
completely
with
the
petitioners
there,
although
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
serving
the
purposes
of
qualified
immunity,
that
the
threat
of
suit
not
interfere
with
lawful
discretion
and
insubstantial
claims
not
be
a
burden.
it
really
doesn't
do
that.
it
filters
out
some
cases,
but
it
doesn't
filter
out
cases
depending
upon
whether
they're
more
or
less
substantial,
or
depending
upon
whether
they
are
in
the
area
of
unclear
law
or
the
area
of
clear
law.
it
seems
much
more
like
an
arbitrary
rule
that
just
filters
out
cases.
it's
almost
as
if
in
medical
malpractice
cases,
because
courts
will
worry
about
too
many
of
these
cases
being
insubstantial
and
interfering
with
doctors'
freedom
of
action,
a
rule
were
adopted
which
would
say
that
they
have
to
be
based
on
eyewitness
testimony
of
the
medical
malpractice
rather
than
on
other
kinds
of
evidence.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
