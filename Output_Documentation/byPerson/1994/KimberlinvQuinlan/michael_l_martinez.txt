mr.
michael
l.
martinez
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it's
important
at
the
outset
to
note
that
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
office
with
respect
to
the
point
that
heightened
pleading
standard
is
misnomer,
and
the
court
doesn't
need
to
reach
the
so-called
heightened
pleading
standard
issue
in
this
case
because
this
case
is
really
a
heightened
production
case.
this
case
came
up
through
the
district
court
when
the
respondents
move
to
dismiss
or
for
summary
judgment,
as
almost
always
happens
in
these
cases,
as
their
initial
response
to
the
complaint.
they
moved
to
dismiss
or
summary
judgment
asserting
qualified
immunity.
in
response
to
that,
the
petitioner
submitted
several
exhibits,
along
with
some
deposition
testimony,
and
in
reply
the
government,
who
at
that
time
was
representing
the
respondents,
responded
with
that
as
well,
and
the
district
court
decided
this
case
on
a
qualified
immunity
basis.
now,
it
decided
it
in
terms
of
applying
what
has
been
called
the
heightened
pleading
standard,
and
judge
green
disagreed
with
what
the
d.c.
circuit
law
is
in
terms
of
direct
versus
circumstantial
evidence,
but
that
was
the
basis
it
was
decided
on,
and
really
this
case
is
a
heightened
production
case,
not
a
heightened
pleading
case,
although
the
rule
has
been
called
variably
by
various
courts
a
heightened
pleading
standard.
it's
important
to
understand
that
this
rule
flows
out
of
this
court's
decision
in
harlow
v.
fitzgerald
and
its
progeny.
harlow
made
it
very
clear,
as
subsequent
cases
have
as
well,
that
this
court
wanted
to
extract
the
subjective
component
of
the
immunity
analysis
that
existed
before
harlow.
prior
to
harlow,
there
was
both
a
subjective
inquiry
and
an
objective
inquiry.
harlow
extracted
the
subjective
inquiry
prong
of
that
analysis
precisely
because
this
court
recognized
that
questions
of
motive
like
we
have
in
this
case
can
inherently
only
be
resolved
by
a
jury,
and
this
court
decided,
because
of
the
numerous
kinds
of
costs
and
impediments
that
these
kinds
of
lawsuits
impose
on
public
officials,
that
it
was
not
worth...
for
protection
of
the
public
and
the
protection
of
an
efficiently
run
government,
it
was
not
worth
getting
into
the
burdens
of
discovery
and
what-not
for
inquiring
into
an
official's
motive,
and
therefore
harlow
can
be
read
as
totally
excluding
an
inquiry
into
motive.
none
of
the
lower
courts,
with
the
possible
exception
here
and
there
of
an
occasional
court,
has
been
willing,
however,
to
read
harlow
and
its
progeny
as
it
can
be
read,
namely--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
it's
precisely
for
that
reason,
and
numerous
courts
have
examined
that
harlow...
the
question
of
whether
harlow
could
be
read
that
broadly.
it's
precisely
because
the
lower
courts
have
decided
that
it
cannot
be
read
that
broadly
that
we
have
had
the
development
over
the
years
of
the
so-called
heightened
pleading
standard.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
no,
i
was--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--i
was
not
quarreling
with
that.
i
was
merely
stating
that
to
set
the
stage
for
why
we
have
these
heightened
pleading
standards,
or
really,
as
in
this
case,
a
heightened
proof
standard.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
in
adopting
this
direct
versus
circumstantial
component
of
this
heightened
pleading
or
heightened
proof
standard,
was,
i
think,
attempting
to
come
as
close
to
what
the
purpose
and
meaning
of
harlow
was,
but
at
the
same
time
preserving
the
interests
of
allowing
a
petitioner,
a
plaintiff,
to
go
forward
with
the
case
where
that
plaintiff
had
only
the
very
strongest
kind
of
evidence
to
support
a
bad
motive
on
the
part
of
an
actor.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
your
honor,
in
this
context...
justice
scalia,
in
this
context
the
authority
for
doing
that
is
a
couple
of
things.
it
arises
in
part
out
of
the
fact
that
qualified
immunity
is
a
substantive
defense,
and
i
think
when
you
couple
that
with
a
requirement
in
rule
56(c)
that
a
party
opposing
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
has
to
come
back
with
very
specific
responses
to
that
motion
to
dismiss
or
for
summary
judgment.
you
can
impose
it
on
that
basis.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
well,
i...
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
is
that
it
stems
from
the
very
strong
message
that
this
court
has
sent
in
harlow
and
cases
after
harlow
that
we
do
not
want
to
get
into
motive.
we
want
to
purge
from
the
question
of
qualified
immunity
what
an
official's
motive
is,
and
so
the
development
of
any
of
these
heightened
pleading
standards
has
been
to
try
and
deal
with
the
conflicting
concerns
of,
you
know,
how
on
the
one
hand
do
we
decide
these
qualified
immunity
cases
on
an
objective
basis
when
the
question
of
motive
itself
is
inherently
a
subjective
inquiry?
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
well,
your
honor,
the
other
examples
where
those
kind
of
standards
apply,
which
we've
mentioned
in
our
brief,
would
include
fraud
cases,
would
include
conspiracy
allegations--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--fraud
cases
are.
conspiracy
allegations
are
not.
there's
the
two-witness
rule
that
requires--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--when...
that--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--your
honor,
i
believe
it's
primarily
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
it's
on
that
basis
that
the
d.c.
circuit
adopted
this
particular
direct
versus
circumstantial
evidence.
the
idea
was
to
require
only
the
strongest
kind
of
evidence
at
the
outset
in
responding
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
for
summary
judgment
asserting
qualified
immunity.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
we
don't
quibble
with
that,
your
honor.
that's
clearly
true.
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
that
say
that
in
different
contexts.
however,
the
substantive
immunity
right
here
and
the
purposes
that
underlie
immunity
justify
in
this
context
having
that
kind
of
rule.
they
do
because
qualified
immunity
again,
arising
out
of
harlow,
attempts
as
much
as
possible
to
purge
the
question
of
motive
from
the
inquiry.
i
think
it's
important
to
keep--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--no,
i
don't
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
for
example,
we're
not
talking
about,
here,
about
the
egregious
case.
i
think
you
wouldn't
ever
get
to
this
point
where,
unless
you
had
somebody
who
acted
objectively
unreasonable.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
a
set
of
circumstances
where
a
public
official
acts
in
an
objectively
unreasonable
manner,
then
you
don't
get
to
the
question
of
motive.
conversely,
as
in
this
case,
where
you
have
a
set
of
circumstances
where
the
official
acted
in
an
objectively
reasonable
manner,
the
motive
should
not
matter--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--because
he
has
not
violated--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--well,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
it's...
your
honor,
when
you
couple
the
fact
here
with
the
fact
that
he
did
not...
the
respondents
did
not
violate
any
clearly
established
law,
and
on
an
objective
view
of
this
record
did
not
violate
an
official's...
did
not
violate
mr.
kimberlin's
constitutional
rights,
on
an
objective
view,
setting
aside
motive
for
a
moment,
he's
clearly
entitled
to
qualified
immunity,
and
that's
what
harlow
says.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
now--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--there
were
reasons,
but
the
reason
is
different
from
motive.
the
reason...
there
are
really
two
issues
here.
the
first
was
the
cancellation
of
the
press
conference
by
the
petitioner,
and
the
second
was
his
being
placed
in
administrative
detention
later
that
night,
and
the
reasons,
which
are
well
articulated
in
the
record
by
evidence,
documentary
evidence
at
or
near
the
time
that
these
events
occurred,
the
cancellation
of
the
press
conference
arose
out
of
the
fact
that
prison
regulations
do
not
provide
inmates
to
have
press
conferences.
they
do
not
permit
that.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
the
second
one
was
that
director
quinlan
was
informed
that
evening
that
a
national
reporter
had
reported
to
the
director
of
public
affairs,
mr.
miller,
at
the
department
of
justice,
that
the
petitioner
feared
his
life
was
in
danger.
upon
hearing
that,
mr.
quinlan
said,
well,
let's
place
him
in
administrative
detention
until
we
can
determine
whether
that
in
fact
is
true,
and
he
was
put
aside
in
administrative
detention,
which
is
a
nonpunitive
detention,
until
the
nature
of
the
threat
could
be
assessed,
and--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
question
has
to
be,
do
we,
as
a
society,
want
to
engage
in
these
kinds
of
inquiries
about
motive
when
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
shows
that
the
actions
were
violative
of
any
clearly
established
law,
but
where
there's--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--no,
your
honor,
i
would
agree
that
could
be
inquired
into,
but
that's
not
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
kimberlin
was
not
treated
in
any
manner
different
from
anyone
else,
and
that's
the
whole
point.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
when
you
look
at
these
facts,
he
was
acting...
the
respondents
were
acting
objectively
reasonable.
there
was
a
basis
for
denying
the
press
conference.
the
regulations
do
not
provide
for
inmate
press
conferences
and,
indeed,
this
court
has
recognized
in
other
cases
that
it's
proper
for
prison
officials
not
to
allow
inmates
to
have
access
to
the
press
beyond
that
that's
accorded
to
any
other
member
of
the
public.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
would
disagree
with
that
statement.
leatherman
certainly...
leatherman
held
that
municipalities
sued
under
1983
do
not
have
the
ability
to
apply
a
heightened
pleading
standard,
do
not
have
the
ability
to
assert
that
a
heightened
pleading
standard
applies
to
them,
and
this
court
specifically
in
leatherman
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
whether
a
heightened
pleading
standard
would
apply
to
individually
sued
public
officials,
and
the
rationale--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
the
rationale
of
leatherman
was
that
heightened
pleading
standards
don't
apply
to
municipalities
because
municipalities
do
not
have
the
right
to
assert
qualified
immunity.
that's
the
distinction
in
this
case.
now,
there
are
some
lower
courts
that
have
held,
subsequent
to
leatherman,
that
the
rationale
of
leatherman
would
preclude
any
application
of
heightened
pleading
standards
to
these
kinds
of
cases
against
public
officials,
but
there
are
also
other
courts
that
have
examined
the
issue
and
held
to
the
contrary.
the
d.c.
circuit
has
looked
at
it
in
this
case,
as
has
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i
believe
one
or
two
other
circuits
have
as
well,
so
that
issue
obviously
has
not
been
finally
decided,
but
i
would
take
issue
with
the
notion
that
leatherman
would
exclude
this
kind
of
rule
in
cases
where
public
officials
are
sued
in
a
bivens
or
1983
context.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
primarily
i
would
agree
with
that--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--justice
souter,
yes.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
well--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--i
do
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
no,
it--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
boils
down
again
to
a
reading
of
harlow
and
what
this
court
meant
when
it
wrote
harlow
and
when
it
wrote
its
subsequent
decisions.
this
court
has--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--that's
correct,
but--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--well,
i
would
disagree,
your
honor.
harlow--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--yes.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
in--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--but
that
was
the...
that
is
a
just...
we
gave
that
as
an
example,
justice
ginsburg,
as
a
case
that
supports
the
notion
that
the
application
of
the
direct
versus
circumstantial
rule
does
not
weed
out
all
cases,
and
that
is
correct,
if
you're
going
to
have
a
rule
that
permits...
that
opens
the
door
slightly
to
motive-based
cases
going
forward
in
this
context,
then
davis
v.
passman
is
such
a
case,
because
congressman
passman
in
that
case
wrote
a
letter
to
the
plaintiff,
mrs.
davis,
saying
we
don't
want
to
hire
you
because
we've
got
enough
women
already.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
well,
your
honor,
it's
not
my
heightened
evidence
rule,
but
the
answer
is,
i
would
say
yes,
there
are...
i
would
think
that
any
statements
made
by
witnesses,
if
you
had
someone
who
perhaps
overheard
a
statement
made
by
the
defendant,
i
think
there
are
other
situations,
clearly,
where
direct
evidence
would
come
up
in
a
manner
that
might
be
other
than
a
written
letter
like
you
had
in
davis
v.
passman,
but--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--well,
your
honor,
you
have
to
draw
the
line
somewhere,
otherwise
you're
getting
back
to
the
notion
we
had
pre-harlow,
where
you
had
extensive
inquiries
into
motive
on
the
part
of
plaintiffs
suing
government
officials
in
their
individual
capacities.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
i--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--i
can't
think
of
any,
justice
scalia.
i
would
say
yes--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--that's
essentially
correct.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
that's
essentially
correct.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
well,
i'd
certainly
agree
with
that
wholeheartedly,
justice
breyer.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
and
that's
the
whole
point.
i
think
this
court...
this
court
attempted
in
harlow
to
strike
some
kind
of
a
balance
between--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
court's...
the
court's
precedent
makes
that
very
clear.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
i
think
that's
exactly--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--i
think,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--yes,
sir.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
i
think,
justice
scalia,
to
answer
your
question,
you're
right,
since
bivens
was
a
doctrine
created
by
this
court,
you
certainly
could
create
that
as
an
effort
to
counterbalance
or
respond
to
the
problem
that
has
arisen
out
of
the
creation
of
the
bivens
doctrine.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
i
believe
it
has,
your
honor,
but
that's
not
in
the
record,
and
i
don't
have
any
figures
to
point
to
other
than,
the
only
figures
that
are
in
the
record
are
the
solicitor
general
noted
in
his
brief
that
i
believe
for
the
years
1993
and
1994--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--there
were
something
like
1,500
or
1,600
cases
against
the
bureau
only,
and
that
i
think
ultimately
only
two
of
those
resulted
in
a
judgment.
i'm
not
sure
of
those
numbers
exactly,
but
it's
roughly
along
those
lines.
now,
those
figures
don't
tell
us
how
many
of
those
cases
went
through
a
discovery
phase,
how
many
of
them,
you
know,
were
dealt
with
at
what
stage
and
how
they
ultimately
got
dealt
with
by
the
district
courts,
but
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
yes,
a
substantial
number
of
these
cases
have
been
filed
and
continue
to
be
filed.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
well,
justice
stevens,
the
1983
qualified...
qualified
immunity
is
a
judicial
doctrine
that
goes
back
many
years,
and
the
court
in
a
couple
of
decisions
in
the
1970's,
after
bivens
had
been
announced
by
this
court,
applied
and
expanded
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine
to
apply
to
both
1983
and
bivens
cases.
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
that's
correct.
that's
absolutely
correct,
and--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
justice
ginsburg.
if
i
may,
with
the
time
i
have
left,
we
have...
i'd
like
to
address
the
point
we
made
in
our
brief
with
respect
to
an
alternative
standard.
if
for
some
reason
the
court
decides...
and
i
appreciate
that
you
have
recognized
the
problem,
as
justice
breyer
said,
that
there
is
a
problem
here.
if
for
some
reason
the
court
decides
that
the
direct
versus
circumstantial
evidence
test
is
not
the
way
the
court
wants
to
proceed
in
dealing
with
this
problem,
we
believe
an
alternative
that
the
court
ought
to
consider
and
adopt
is
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
test,
as
we've
outlined
in
our
brief.
that
is
a
test
that
is
applied
by
this
court
in
various
other
areas
of
the
law.
it's
well-developed--
mr.
michael
l.
martinez
--because
of
the...
justice
breyer,
because
of
the
particular
concerns
that
underlie
the
rationale
of
harlow.
the
way
that
test
would
work
would
be
a...
when
a
complaint
is
filed,
the
government
would
respond
with
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
for
summary
judgment
asserting
qualified
immunity,
and
this
is
only
in
motive-based
cases,
i
hasten
to
add,
asserting
qualified
immunity,
and
then
to
rebut
the
allegation
of
improper
motive,
the
burden
would
shift
to
the
plaintiff
to
respond
with
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
there
was
an
improper
motive,
and
we
believe
the
application
of
that
standard
would
help
obviate
this
problem
a
little
bit.
under
that
standard,
circumstantial
evidence,
we
contemplate,
would
be
permitted
in,
but
it
would
still
have
to
be
very
high
circumstantial
and
direct
evidence,
because
it
would
have
to
add
up,
as
it
does
in
a
libel
setting,
to
clear
and
convincing
evidence
to
defeat
a
motion
of
qualified
immunity
where
intent
is
a
factor.
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
that
regardless
of
which
of
these
standards
you
apply,
if
you
decide
to
apply
one
of
them,
it's
important
to
emphasize
again
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
actions
of
the
respondents
were
objectively
reasonable.
indeed,
a
conspiracy
is
alleged
in
this
case,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
even
shows
that
these
two
respondents
ever
spoke
to
each
other,
let
alone
conspired,
and
it's
important
to
keep
that
in
mind.
this
case
is
exhibit
a,
in
our
view,
as
to
why
there
should
be
a
heightened
pleading
or
proof
standard
and
as
to
why,
as
this
court
said
in
butz
v.
economou,
these
insubstantial
cases
should
be
terminated
quickly
and
promptly,
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
that
completes
my
argument.
