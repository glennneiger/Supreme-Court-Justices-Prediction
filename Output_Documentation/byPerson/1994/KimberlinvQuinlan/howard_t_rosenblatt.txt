mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
below
erred
in
requiring
bivens
plaintiffs
to
come
forward
with
direct
evidence
of
unlawful
intent
in
cases
that
turn
on
intent,
and
in
holding
that
reliance
on
circumstantial
evidence,
no
matter
how
probative,
is
inadequate
to
overcome
a
claim
of
qualified
immunity.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
found
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
had
supported
his
allegations,
his
first
amendment
allegations,
with
facts
and
evidence
that
were
concrete,
specific,
and
nonconclusory.
in
reversing,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
the
petitioner
must
also
have
come
forward
with
direct
evidence
of
intent,
and
that
reliance
on
circumstantial
evidence
is
insufficient
to
overcome
a
claim
of
qualified
immunity.
now,
there's
no
question,
i
think,
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
means
by
direct
evidence
of
intent
is
some
evidence
of
an
expression
of
intent
that
comes
directly
from
the
lips
of
the
defendant.
as
the
concurring
opinion
below
put
it,
a
confession.
now,
i'd
like
to
address
just
two
points
here
today.
first,
that
this
direct
evidence
rule
of
the
d.c.
circuit
is
contrary
to
this
court's
consistent
precedent
with
respect
to
direct
and
circumstantial
evidence,
and
is
contrary
to
logic,
we
would
submit,
and
secondly,
that
this
court
has
available
to
it
several
options
that
will
strike
a
more
appropriate
balance
between
the
rights
of
the
victims
of
constitutional
violations
to
seek
vindication
in
court
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
interest
of
public
officials
to
avoid
the
distractions
that
can
come
from
an
insubstantial
lawsuit.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
the--
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
--we
did
not
raise
that
question,
your
honor.
the
matter
had
been
pretty
well
settled
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
d.c.
in
the
case
of
siegert
v.
gilley.
we
didn't
raise
it.
obviously--
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
--yes,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
--our
position
is
first,
even
though
we
didn't
waive
it...
even
though
we
didn't
assert
it
it's
not
waived
because
it's
a
jurisdictional
question,
and
secondly,
that
would
be
one
way
for
this
court
to
resolve
this
case,
to
find
that
pursuant
to
the
court's
decision
in
johnson,
whatever
that
may
turn
out
to
be,
we
find
that
there's
no
jurisdiction,
there
should
have
been
jurisdiction
by
the
court
of
appeals,
therefore
the
district
court's
ruling
which
allowed
the
case
to
stay,
allowed
the
case
to
proceed
with
discovery,
would
be
reinstated.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
it's
happened
before,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
i
think
that
would
be
an
absolute
legitimate
reading
of
the
court's
decision.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
be
specific
in
saying,
not
require
the
lawyers,
those
of
us
who
practition
in
the
area
and
the
judges
below,
to
try
to
infer
that
that's
what
the
court
had
in
mind
but--
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
--well,
my
concern,
your
honor,
is
that
advocates
and
judges
may
well
decide
that
it's
a
part
of
qualified
immunity,
but
it's
not
a
part
of
qualified
immunity
that's
immediately
appealable,
because
this
is
all
a
balance
that
we're
trying
to
reach.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
right.
that's
what
would
happen.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
right,
and
we
don't
think
it's
necessary.
we
think
that--
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
--i
think
the
appealability
issue
has
not
been
briefed
below.
it...
the
court
i
think
may
well
find
this
way.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
for
those
practicing
that
it
could
go
ahead
and
strike
down
this
direct
evidence
rule
and
perhaps
any
heightened
pleading
rule,
but
not
necessary.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
--exactly
right.
exactly
right.
[laughter]
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
no.
it's
our
position,
though,
that
i
think
just,
first
and
foremost
the
court
can,
and
can
sua
sponte,
on
its
own
initiative,
decide
that
there's
no
jurisdiction
at
the
court
of
appeals
and
there's
no
jurisdiction
in
this
court,
your
honor,
and
that
could
be
the
first...
that
often
is
the
first
question
that
one
would
look
at,
and
it
would
be
a
way
of
disposing,
or
as
justice
scalia
says,
not
disposing
of
this
issue.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
i
think
if
we
assume
that
all
questions
of
qualified
immunity
are
appealable,
then
we
would
be
saying
yes,
this
is
not
a
question
of
qualified
immunity,
and
therefore
it's
not
an
affirmative
defense
of
the
federal
officials,
but
we
would
have
to
make
that
assumption
first
that
all
questions
that
relate
to
qualified
immunity
are
appealable
for
us
to
get
that
inference.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
yes.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
right.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
it's
our
position
that
that
is
not
a
qualified
immunity
defense.
that's
the
whole
rub
of
the
case.
qualified
immunity--
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
--well,
in
this
one
we
also
think
that
it's
not
part
of
qualified
immunity.
the
d.c.
circuit
disagrees.
the
d.c.
circuit
says
this
isn't
an
i-didn't-do-it
kind
of
defense.
this
is
a,
even
if
i
didn't,
you
don't
have
direct
evidence.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
i
didn't
think
it,
but--
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
--well,
they're
trying
to
strike
an
appropriate
balance
here.
they're
trying
to...
they're
trying
to
put
into
content
the
concerns
that
this
court
expressed
in
harlow.
those
concerns
were
that
any
question
of
state
of
mind
automatically
goes
to
a
jury,
and
therefore
it's
inconsistent
with
the
view
that
these
cases
should
be
terminated
quickly
if
they're
insubstantial.
it's
our
view
that
that's
no
longer
the
case.
that
concern,
we
think,
has
been
put
to
rest
in
subsequent
opinions
of
this
court
and
the
lower
courts.
it's
no
longer
the
case
that
state
of
mind
automatically
goes
to
jury...
to
a
jury.
but
for
your
honor's
question,
the
reason
that
it's
conceivable,
although
we
would
argue
against
it,
it's
conceivable
that
courts
of
appeals
would
think
that
this
is
still
a
matter
of
qualified
immunity,
is
because
it's
not
only
an
i-didn't-think-it
defense,
it's
a
you-don't-have-a-quantum-of-evidence
allowing
you
to
stay
in
court.
whether
i
did
it
or
not,
it's
your
job,
mr.
petitioner,
to
come
forward
with
some
evidence.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
well,
the
i-didn't-do-it,
the
way
i
understood
it,
was
more
the
ultimate
question
to
be
decided,
and
in
fact
if
this
court
or
if
the
lower
courts
had--
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
--it
is
the
ultimate
question.
the
only
way
that
it
would
be
part
of
qualified
immunity
is
this
idea
of
having
a
heightened
standard,
although
not
proving
your
case,
having
enough
to
stay
in
court.
we
would
agree
with
your
honor,
though,
that
first
that
it's...
that
it
is
part
of
the
i-didn't-do-it
defense,
and
that's
not
part
of
qualified
immunity.
in
our
view,
qualified
immunity
is
typically
maybe
i
did
it,
maybe
i
didn't.
it
doesn't
matter,
because
i'm
immune.
the
law
wasn't
clearly
established.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
well,
we
think
that
the
direct
evidence
rule
versus
circumstantial
evidence
rule
is
contrary
to
this
court's
consistent
precedent.
this
court
has
long
held
that
there
is
intrinsically
no
difference
between
direct
and
circumstantial
evidence,
that
sometimes
circumstantial
evidence
can
be
even
stronger,
more
satisfying,
more
persuasive
than
direct
evidence,
and
that's
particularly
true
when,
in
cases
like
this,
justice
ginsburg,
intent
is
at
issue.
circumstantial
evidence
is
often
the
only
kind
of
evidence
to
get
an
intent,
and
it's
generally
the
most
reliable,
how
people
act,
how
people
behave
are
often
much
more
probative,
far
more
reliable,
far
more
enlightening
about
someone's
state
of
mind
than
what
they
say
about
it
after
the
fact.
so
in
our
view,
this
is
an
arbitrary
rule
whose
only
purpose
is
to
eliminate
bivens
cases,
and
i
think
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
the
only
causes
of
action
that
are
actionable
here,
the
only
violations
that
are
actionable
here
because
of
the
official's
qualified
immunity,
are
violations
of
rights
that
are
clearly
established,
and
so
this
rule
would
require
federal
officials
and
state
officials
to
confess,
to
admit
to
have
violated
a
right
that
they
are
presumed
to
know
about.
we
think
this
is
likely
to
happen
in
the
most
extraordinary
cases,
and
it
would
wipe
out
an
entire
line
of
bivens
cases,
bivens
cases
that
involve
some
of
our
most
treasured
rights,
the
right...
it
would
eliminate
discrimination
cases,
racial,
gender
discrimination
cases,
the
selective
prosecution
cases,
freedom
to
associate,
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
and
in
this
case
the
first
amendment.
we
think
that
the
public
interest...
and
that's
what
we're
trying
to
do,
i
think,
is
achieve
a
balance.
the
public
interest
in
assuring
that
violations
of
that
type
don't
go
unremedied
is
at
least
as
strong
as
the
interest
in
sparing
federal
officials
the
need
to
possibly
explain
themselves
when
these
rights
are
at
issue.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
to
allow
the
heightened
pleading
rule?
well,
let
me
say,
your
honor,
the
answer...
it's
problematic
after
this
court's
decision
in
leatherman.
we
believe,
though
that
there
are
a
number
of
options
that
would
strike
a
balance.
let
me
be
clear
here.
we
believe
that
there
is
a
legitimate
policy
reason
to
protect
federal
officials
from
insubstantial
lawsuits,
that
at
least
within
the
parameters
of
clearly
established
rights,
federal
officials
should
be
free
to
engage
in
the
unflinching
discharge
of
their
duties,
but
when
clearly
established
rights
are
implicated,
as
this
court
has
held,
federal
officials
should
be
made
to
hesitate,
and
so
there
shouldn't
be
a
total
immunity
against
these
suits.
now,
what
options
are
available
to
the
court?
we
think
that
no
matter
what
option
the
court
takes,
there
are
going
to
be
certain
meritorious
cases
that
get
dismissed,
there
are
going
to
be
certain
blameless
officials
who
go
through
some
discovery,
but
i
think
what
we
should
try
to
do
is
find
a
solution
that
minimizes
both
possibilities.
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case,
the
government
in
this
case
has
come
up
with
a
standard
that
we
would
embrace.
it
basically...
and
i
think
it's...
the
court
has
authority
to
adopt
it
because
it's
consistent
with
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
namely,
and
obviously
the
government
will
articulate
it
better
than
i,
but
namely
when
a
defendant
comes
forward
with
a
qualified
immunity
defense,
it's
up
to
the
plaintiff
to
give
his
story.
he
can't
hide
the
ball.
he
has
to
say
who
did
what
to
whom
when.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
right.
we
believe
it
could
be
done
before
discovery,
at
least
to
tell
the
plaintiff's
story
as
he
currently
knows
it
so
that
the
government
officials
and
the
court
can
determine
whether
we're
really
talking
about
clearly
established
rights.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
well,
we
believe
that
this
court
has
made
clear
that
this
determination
should
take
place
before
discovery,
and
so
this
is--
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
--that's
exactly
right,
and
it
would
have
to
be
viewed
in
the
early
context
of
the
case
in
which
there
is
no
discovery.
the...
at
times
the
plaintiff
can
only
paint
with
a
broad
brush,
and
that
should
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
it
is,
your
honor,
because
rule
9
says
what
has
to
be
in
a
complaint,
and
that
the
only
heightened
pleading
that's
permissible
are
for
cases
of
fraud,
and
so
we
think
that
it
would
be
consistent
with
9(b),
because
this
is
something
that
would
go
on
during
the
motion
practice.
the
one
thing
we
would
urge
is
that
this
direct
evidence
standard
should
be
rejected,
and
that
the
adoption
of
almost
any
other
standard
leads
to
reversal
of
the
court
below.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
we
absolutely
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
however,
unlike
the
situation
when
harlow
v.
fitzgerald
was
decided,
this
court
4
years
later
decided
anderson
v.
liberty
lobby,
which
rejected
the
notion
that
simply
because
you're
alleging
that
motive
was
improper
doesn't
mean
that
you
get
to
a
jury.
it
means
that
that
is
as
susceptible
to
early
determination
as
any
other
factual
issue,
and
the
lower
courts
have
followed
that.
and
so
yes,
we
believe
that
the
federal
official
should
be
protected
from
that
kind
of
bare
allegation
of
malice,
but
today,
after
harlow
and
after
anderson
v.
liberty
lobby,
that
is
the
case.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
it
was
a
libel
case
which
gave
even
more
protection
to
the
defendants,
and
we
think
that
that
actually
draws
a
nice
parallel,
because
we
are
looking...
we
do
have
policy
reasons
to
protect
the
defendants
in
this
case,
and
so
for
that
reason
we
think
that
they're
very
close.
the
main
thing
that
anderson
did,
at
least
in
many
of
these
other
cases,
is
show
that
state
of...
just
because
state
of
mind's
at
issue,
just
because
you
allege
it,
doesn't
mean
that
you
get
to
drag,
in
this
case
federal
officials
through
the
litigation
mud
and
into
trial.
there
are
still
ways
through
control
of
discovery
and
through
vigorous
applications
of
the
current
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
as
they
currently
exist,
to
protect
what
are
very
important
values,
namely
officials
being
able
to
perform
their
duties
without
undue,
although
perhaps
not
without
know,
but
without
undue
impediment.
if
there
are--
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
--right,
and
it--
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
--let
me
just
point
out,
there
is
no
affidavit
like
that,
but
that's
certainly
their
position.
i
think
what
we
would
have
to
do
and
i
think
what
we've
done,
although
discovery
is
still
early,
what
we
would
have
to
do
is
come
forward
with
facts
and
evidence
that
would
permit
a
jury,
would
be
sufficient
to
permit
a
jury
to
come
back
in
our
favor,
and
so
in
this
case,
our
main
approach
is
to
show
that
the
explanations
given,
that
the
inmate
feared
for
his
safety,
was
pretextual,
that
the
person
who
supposedly
said
that
has
denied
it
in
a
sworn
affidavit,
that
there
was
no
concern
for
the
safety,
that
there
was
pressure
from
political
forces,
and
on
and
on.
maybe
one
thing
taken
alone
wouldn't
be
enough,
but
taken
together,
we
think
it
at
least
creates
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact,
and
that's
what's
required
in
these
cases
at
least
to
get
more
discovery.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
howard
t.
rosenblatt
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'd
just
like
to
make
a
few
points.
one
is
that
whether
we
call
it
a
heightened
pleading
or
a
heightened
production
standard,
this
rule
fashioned
by
the
d.c.
circuit
is
contrary
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
if
they
call
it
a
heightened
production
standard,
then
it's
contrary
to
rule
56
in
many
ways,
first,
because
not
all
inferences
are
drawn
in
favor
of
the
nonmoving
party,
as
the

mr.

well,
it's
clearly
the
case
that
there
are
two
interests
here
to
be
balanced.
one
of
them
is
to
protect
federal
officials
against
insubstantial
lawsuits.
however,
in
our
view
this
test
not
only
doesn't
do
that
in
many
cases,
but
it
goes
way
too
far
in
favor
of
them
in
other
cases.
thank
you.
