unknown
speaker
mr.
rosen...
go
ahead.
mr.
rosenblatt,
the
district
court
thought
the
case
ought
to
proceed.
it
didn't
terminate
it.
unknown
speaker
and
an
appeal
was
then
taken
by
the
defendants
in
the
case
to
the
cadc.
did
you
raise
the
question
there
about
whether
an
appeal
was
properly
before
the
cadc?
unknown
speaker
cohen
didn't
permit
an
appeal?
unknown
speaker
you're
aware
that
we
had
a
case
argued
here
recently--
unknown
speaker
--that
isn't
too
far
removed
from
this,
the
johnson
case,
and
i
just
wondered
what
your
position
was
on
the...
whether
the
cadc
had
appellate
jurisdiction
here.
unknown
speaker
or
more
precisely,
that
would
be
a
way
for
this
court
not
to
resolve
this
case.
[laughter]
because
the
case
would
just
continue,
and
the
same
issue
that
we
thought
we
would
reach
would
come
up
later.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rosenblatt,
would
that
be
so
if
we
were
to
say
that
there's
no
appellate
jurisdiction
because
it
doesn't
come
under
the
mitchell-cohen
exception,
then
aren't
we
in
effect
saying
that
this
kind
of
defense
doesn't
fit
under
qualified
immunity,
that
what
qualified
immunity
deals
with
is
whether
or
not
the
law
is
clearly
established?
if
we
say...
make
that
jurisdictional
determination,
and
that
means
there
is
no
qualified
immunity
defense,
then
the
heightened
pleading
rule,
the
direct
or
indirect
evidence
goes
out
the
window.
it's
just
not
a
qualified
immunity
issue.
unknown
speaker
how
could
it
not
be,
when
the
whole
purpose
of
the
lower
courts
exempting
the
special
pleading
rule
and
the
direct
evidence
rule
was
to
tie
it
into
this
qualified
immunity?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
go
back
to
the
split
qualified
immunity
that
it
was
originally
the
intention
of
harlow
to
get
rid
of.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
quite
an
irony,
to
go
that
circle.
unknown
speaker
are
we
supposed
to
address
this
without...
i
mean,
i
find
this
actually
a
rather
difficult
question,
whether
it's
appealable
or
not,
and
we
have
another
case
that
may
shed
some
light,
or
may
not,
but
there's
no
decision
of
the
lower
court
on
this
issue,
is
there,
and
has
it
been
fully
briefed
here?
i
don't
think...
i
mean,
this...
i'm
nervous
about
deciding
this
without
a
lower
court
decision,
without...
what
do
you
think
we
should
do?
unknown
speaker
so
you'd
like
us
both
to
say
it's...
we
strike
down
the
direct
evidence
rule
and
by
the
way,
it
wasn't
appealable.
unknown
speaker
i
realize--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
i
mean,
that's
not
going
to
happen,
so
what
should
we
do?
[laughter]
what
should
we
do?
unknown
speaker
then
we
get
back
to
my
question,
but
if
you
say
that,
then
aren't
you,
in
effect,
saying
it
doesn't
come
within
qualified
immunity?
unknown
speaker
you're
familiar
with
the
case
that
we
heard
last
week,
which
was
a
question
of,
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
a
case
is,
what's
in
an
officer's
head?
unknown
speaker
is
the
first
case,
what
happened,
did
he
do
it,
is
that
a
qualified
immunity
defense
when
the
officer
says,
i
didn't
do
it,
i
wasn't
there?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
how
about
this
one?
all
right.
unknown
speaker
this
is
an
i-didn't-think-it.
unknown
speaker
now,
if
an
i-didn't-think-it
defense
is
just
like
an
i-didn't-do-it
defense,
then
neither
of
them
come
within
qualified
immunity,
but
you
hesitated,
and
it's
interesting
that
you
did,
because
it
seems
to
me
the
courts
of
appeals
are
doing
exactly
that,
having
much
more
difficulty
categorizing,
characterizing
the
i-didn't-think-it
than
they
had
with
i-didn't-do-it.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
the
same
for
the
i-didn't-do-it?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
whether
i
thought
it
also
is
the
ultimate
question?
unknown
speaker
what
are
your
views
on
the
merits
of
the
issues
that
are
here,
mr.
rosenblatt?
unknown
speaker
you're...
i
assume
you
would
make
the
same
arguments
against
a
heightened
pleading
rule
as
opposed
to
a
direct
evidence
rule,
but
would
you
like
to
address
the
latter?
do
you
think,
if
we
disagreed
with
you
as
to
the
policy
balance
here,
and
we
thought
it
was
very
important
to
protect
public
officials
from
frivolous
suits,
do
we
have
the
authority
to
impose
a
heightened
pleading
rule?
unknown
speaker
this
is
in
the...
at
the
summary
judgment,
early
discovery
phase,
rather
than
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
i
assume?
unknown
speaker
by
requesting
affidavits
as
part
of
a
summary
judgment
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
a
more
definite
statement,
like...
12
being
a
more
definite
statement.
unknown
speaker
is
that
consistent
with
rule
9?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rosenblatt,
don't
you
exaggerate
it
somewhat
by
saying
that
although
there's
an
interest
in
law
enforcement
officers
acting
fearlessly,
there's
also
an
interest
in
preventing
their
violating
clearly
established
rights?
what's
involved
here
is
they're
doing
things
that
they
had
full
authority
to
do
which
didn't
violate
any
rights
unless...
unless...
there
was
an
improper
motive
behind
what
they
did.
well,
you're
always
able
to
allege
an
improper
motive.
any
lawful
action
of
an
official
can
be
unlawful
if
it
is
done
for
an
unlawful
motive,
so
i
don't
see
that
this
is
a
case
of
easily
protecting
clearly
established
rights.
there's
a
serious
problem
on
your
side
of
the
case
as
to
whether
there
ought
to
be
some
higher
standard.
now,
whether
we
have
authority
to
adopt
it
or
not
is
another
question,
but
surely
you
should
give
the
devil
his
due
and
say
there
is
a
real
problem
when
a
law
enforcement
official
does
something
that's
perfectly
legal,
but
he
may
be
held
liable
because
somebody
can
charge
him
with
having
done
it
for
an
improper
motive?
unknown
speaker
but
to
what
extent
is
liberty
lobby
on
the
intent
phase
colored
by
the
fact
that
it's
a
libel
case?
unknown
speaker
can
you
be
concrete
about
this
case?
this
is
an
officer
who
said,
i
did
it
for
a
proper
reason.
he
did
it
for
a
proper
reason,
he
didn't
do
anything
that's
in
any
way
wrong.
unknown
speaker
he
has
an
affidavit
that
says
that.
what
must
you
do
to
get
you
to
trial?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
rosenblatt.
mr.
bender,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
get
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
ordinarily
just
because
the
district
court
decided
a
question
of
law
wrong.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
characterize
it
as
a
qualified
immunity
defense.
if
it's
not,
if
it's
like,
i
didn't
do
it,
then
it
doesn't
come
out...
then
it
doesn't
come
under
qualified
immunity
and
you
don't
have
any
reason
to
have
any
special
rules
of
any
kind.
unknown
speaker
if
your
argument
was
that
i
didn't
do
it
is
a
qualified
immunity.
unknown
speaker
well,
cases
where
the
allegation
just
turns
on
the
so-called
improper
motive
of
the
official
seem
to
be
cases
that,
as
others
have
pointed
out,
are
very
easily
brought.
unknown
speaker
and
difficult
to
deal
with
factually.
now,
just
how
should
we
deal
with
cases
like
that
involving
public
officials?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
rule
do
you
tie
it
to?
what
rule
permits
courts
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
must.
i
think
you
would
say
that
a
judge...
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to.
unknown
speaker
could
you
take
it
as
the
pleading
defendant
pleads,
as
the
defendant,
qualified
immunity,
and
that
is
taken
automatically
as...
a
court
in
sum
says
that's
automatically
a
statement,
a
motion
for
a
more
definite
statement
unless
the
complaint
is
already
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
and
can
we
do
that?
unknown
speaker
you'd
say
the
plea
of
qualified
immunity
is
taken
as
a
matter
of
law
to
be
a
motion
for
a
more
definite
statement,
which
must
be
satisfied
unless
the
complaint
is
sufficiently
detailed.
i
just
want
to
get
your--
unknown
speaker
--26(b)(2),
is
that
what
you
said?
unknown
speaker
(b)(3),
okay.
(b)(2)
i
didn't
see--
unknown
speaker
--that
overlay
would
come
from
the
substantive
rule
about
the
qualified
immunity
protection,
because
otherwise
averments
in
an
answer
are
deemed...
automatically
deemed
denied
or
avoided--
unknown
speaker
--and
here
it
was
suggested
that
we
have
just
the
opposite,
automatic...
automatic
assumption.
instead
of
deeming
that
you
deny
it
or
avoid
it,
you
must
answer
it.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
bender.
mr.
martinez,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
martinez,
wouldn't
that
just
go
against
what
really
harlow
was
trying
to
do?
plaintiffs
had
two
strings
in
their
bow
pre-harlow.
they
could
say,
violated
clearly
established
law,
and
then
they
could
say,
even
if
the
law
was
as
foggy
and
as
mushy
as
it
could
be,
this
officer
acted
maliciously.
it's
the
second
thing
that
harlow
took
out
of
that
case,
and
there
isn't,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
any
hint
that
harlow
was
conceiving
of
this
kind
of
case
where
liability
or
not
turns
on
what
the
officer
thought.
harlow
took
away
from
plaintiffs
that
malicious...
he
was
a
bad
actor,
even
if
the
law
was
foggy,
and
that's
understandable.
it
didn't
speak
at
all
to
this...
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
to
this
question.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
quarreling
with
that
and
said
that
harlow
could
be
read
that
broadly--
unknown
speaker
--to
take
out
all
consideration
of--
unknown
speaker
--do
we
have
authority
to
do
that?
i
mean,
to
decide
that
certain
defenses
are
favored
and
others
are
less
favored,
and
we
can
simply
require
more
evidence
for
some
things
than
others?
what's
our
authority
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
i
mean,
specific
responses.
you
have
to
specifically
show
what
evidence
you
have
to
prove
the
illicit
intent,
but
in
all
other
situations
that
evidence
can
be
direct
evidence,
it
can
be
circumstantial
evidence,
it
does
not
have
to
be
more
than
a
preponderance
to
prevail--
unknown
speaker
--what
other
instances
do
you
have
where
we
have
created
such...
without
any
statutory
authority
such
heightened
standards
of
proof
or
of
pleading?
unknown
speaker
but
those
are
in
the
federal
rules--
--they're
there.
--fraud
cases.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
refer
to...
the
conspiracy
allegations
are
what,
where--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
in
our
cases,
or
in
the
courts
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
i
think
it's
only
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
unless
i'm
mistaken.
unknown
speaker
why
is...
i
thought
circumstantial
is
sometimes
stronger
than
direct,
direct
is
sometimes
stronger
than
circumstantial.
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
that's
quite
different.
isn't
motive
here
really
relevant
as
evidentiary?
but
for
a
bad
motive
it
is
quite
likely,
they
want
to
prove,
that
the
person
would
have
been
allowed
to
speak,
and
therefore
there
was
some
kind
of
political
discrimination.
i
mean,
it
isn't
as
if
they...
isn't
that
what...
how...
what's
the
underlying
theory
of
this?
unknown
speaker
it's
only
objective--
unknown
speaker
--well--
--isn't
it
only
objectively
reasonable
if
the
motive
was
what
he
says
it
was?
unknown
speaker
if
it's
a
pretext,
is
it
objectively
reasonable?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
was
no
motive--
unknown
speaker
--if
there
was
no
motive
whatsoever,
they
couldn't
have
done
this.
they
had
to
have...
they
could
not
have
thrown...
did
what
they
did
to
him,
i
don't
remember
the
details,
for
no
reason
at
all.
they
had
to
have
a
reason,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
go
to
the
second
one.
what
about
the--
unknown
speaker
--there's
disagreement
about
the
motive
with
which
that
was
done.
i
mean,
your
client
says,
i
did
it
for
these
reasons,
which
certainly
appear
plausible
on
their
face,
but
the
plaintiff
says
no,
it
was
done
for
improper
political
reasons.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
that
that
simply
cannot
be
inquired
into
in
a
case
like
this?
unknown
speaker
but
you've
always
got
a...
i
won't
say
always,
but
in
many
cases
you
have
a
claim
that
this
was
perfectly
proper
to
have
done
to
this
individual
so
long
as
you
treated
other
people
similarly
situated
the
same
way,
but
if
you
just
made
kind
of
a
totally
different
regime
for
one
person
that
was
much
harsher
than
for
another,
then
you
may
have
a
constitutional
violation
just
based
on
that,
and
you
say
that
can't
be
inquired
into.
unknown
speaker
but
still--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
martinez,
but
for
the
cadc
heightened
evidence
standard,
this
thing
would
proceed
to
trial
on
the
basis
of
circumstantial
evidence,
and
would
you
care
to
comment
on
this
court's
holding
in
leatherman,
handed
down
in
1993,
where
we
made
it
pretty
clear
that
as
a
matter
of
policy
you
might
make
an
argument
to
have
some
other
rule,
but
unless
the
federal
rules
authorized
the
imposition
of
heightened
standards,
the
courts
don't
have
the
authority
to
adopt
them.
unknown
speaker
that
certainly
points
in
a
direction
against
support
of
the
cadc
requirement.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
whole
thrust
of
the
leatherman
opinion.
we
didn't
decide
this
case,
that's
why
we
have
it
here
now,
but
the
thrust
of
it
argues
against
your
position.
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
that
your
argument,
that
its
root
is
that
the
reason
this
case
does
not
come
within
leatherman
is
that
there
is
a
general
proposition
of
immunity
law
that
we
should
not,
in
fact,
tolerate
any
more...
any
further
causes
of
action
than
absolutely
necessary
if
those
causes
of
action
require
an
inquiry
into
motive?
that's
basically
your
proposition,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
and
i
thought
your
reason
was
precedent,
but
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
and
you
agree,
that
in
fact
the
only
sense
in
which
this
court
eliminated
the
inquiry
into
motive
was
as
a
general
characteristic
or
element
of
qualified
immunity.
it
did
not
in
any
way
purport
to
eliminate
that
kind
of
an
inquiry
into
cases
in
which
motive
may
be
an
element
of
a
particular
cause
of
action
to
which
qualified
immunity
is
pleaded.
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
agreed
with
it
when
justice
ginsburg--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
well,
if
that...
if
justice
ginsburg's
statement
of
the
law
is
correct,
then
doesn't
that,
in
effect,
eliminate
your
argument
that
we
should
be
deciding
this
case
in
accordance
with
a
generalized
policy
of
inquiring
into
the
motives
of
officials?
isn't
that
the
end
of
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
because
there
are
some
causes
of
action,
you
admit,
that
do
involve
motive,
and
we
can
and
should
inquire
into
them,
and
if
that
is
the
case,
then
what
is
the
justification
for
a
heightened
pleading
requirement,
let
alone
in
an
unqualified
immunity
case,
let
alone
a
direct
evidence
requirement?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
just
agreed
with
justice
ginsburg's
reading
of
harlow.
unknown
speaker
which
leaves
you
without
much
to
go
on.
unknown
speaker
mr.
martinez,
maybe
we
can
take
it
in
the
context
of
a
concrete
example
that
you
yourself
gave,
davis
v.
passman.
unknown
speaker
a
member
of
congress
says,
i
fire
one
of
my
staff
members,
and
if
that's
done
for
a
reason
like
inefficiency,
or
downsizing,
it's
perfectly
all
right,
but
if
he
says,
i
fire
you
because
we
need
a
man
for
this
job,
then
it's
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
you
gave
that
as
an
example
of
a
case
where
motive
counts.
the
only
thing
that
counted
was
motive.
unknown
speaker
that's
where...
you
had
a
self-confession.
under
your
heightened
evidence
rule,
any...
is
there
anything
other
than
a
self-confession,
yes,
i
had
a
bad
motive,
this
was
my
motive?
anything
else
that
you
could
get
to
trial
on?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
that
letter
might
be,
if
the
case
went
to
trial,
it
might
be
a
southern
gentleman's
way
of
saying
something
that
he
thought
was
a
kindness,
and
that
in
fact
was
not
discriminatory,
and
in
other
cases
you
might
have
somebody
who
was
rampantly
discriminating
because
of
a
person's
sex
or
race,
but
is
very
good
at
using
the
right
words,
you
could
never
prove
it
out
of
that
person's
mouth,
and
you
say
one
case
goes
to
trial,
and
the
other
one
doesn't?
unknown
speaker
mr.
martinez,
i
assume
that
direct
evidence
of
intent
always
has
to
be
a
confession.
i
mean,
i...
in
the
nature
of
things--
unknown
speaker
--isn't
that
the
direct
evidence?
i
mean,
you
can
say
you
can
have
a
witness
instead
of
the
defendant
coming
to
say
it
in
court,
but
it
has
to
be
a
confession.
what
other
direct
evidence
of
intent
is
there?
unknown
speaker
it's
inside
a
person's
head.
unknown
speaker
either
he
utters
it,
or
you
don't
know
it
directly.
unknown
speaker
yes.
it
sounds
to
me
a
little
bit
as
if
this
intent
motive
is
a
red
herring.
i
think
i've
had
a
thousand
cases,
or
five
hundred,
anyway,
where
the
whole
question
involves
motive.
did
he
fire
this
person
because
he
was
a
member
of
the
ppd,
or
the
pnp,
or
was
it
because
he...
late
all
the
time.
it's
the
most
common
kind
of
case.
so
i
thought
that
the
basis
for
your
argument,
an
alternative
basis,
which
i'd
as
soon
you
address
if
you
want,
is
that
if
there
isn't
some
kind
of
heightened
pleading
thing,
the
seven
or
600
district
judges
will
probably
have
50,000
cases
filed
by
everybody
who
wants
to
sue
everybody
all
over
the
government,
and
instead
of
just
getting
rid
of
them
right
away
because
there
are
no
facts,
you
don't
know
what
they
are,
or
if
you
could
find
out
the
facts
they'd
be
nothing,
everybody
has
to
answer
them,
the
department
has
to
write
all
these
answers,
they
have
to
start
doing
discovery,
and
that's
a
very
difficult
burden.
now,
i'm
making
an
argument,
obviously,
that
i
got
out
of
what
you'd
say,
but
i
want
to
know
if
you'd
like
to
address
that.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
i
just--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what's
worrying
about
the
argument
is,
does
this
court
actually
have
the
power
just
to
write
an
opinion
that
says
that,
or
does
it
have
to
refer
the
matter
to
the
rules
committee,
or
does
it
have
to
ask
the
sg
to
bring
it
up
when
he's
on
such
a
committee?
it's
a
question
of
what
we
actually
can
do.
i
mean,
i
recognize
the
problem,
but
i
think
there
is
a
question
as
to
how
do
you
go
about
bringing
about
this
result?
i
mean,
we
don't
know
how
many
cases
would
be
filed.
i
have
a
suspicion,
but
i
don't
know,
so--
--in
that
regard,
mr.
martinez,
you
insist
that...
or
at
least
you
said
that
1983
and
this...
and
bivens
have
to
be
treated
alike,
in
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
to
some
extent,
you
know,
you're
perhaps
too
polite
to
make
the
argument,
but
justice
breyer's
concern
is
certainly
reduced
in
the
case
of
bivens.
since
we
invented
the
cause
of
action
ourselves
i
suppose
we
could
invent
the
attempted
manner
of
proof
of
the
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
that
wouldn't
extend
to
1983,
and
it
would
be
rather
strange
to
treat
bivens
actions
different
from
1983
actions.
unknown
speaker
but
in
a
pinch
you'd
take
it,
i
betcha.
unknown
speaker
let
me
suggest--
unknown
speaker
--well,
has
the
problem...
i
mean,
we're
concerned
with
that
kind
of
thing
as
judges,
but
outside
the
d.c.
circuit,
has
the
paper
been
piling
up?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
martinez--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
martinez,
i
wonder
with
regard
to
qualified
immunity
under
1983,
a)
who
invented
the
qualified
immunity
defense,
and
b)
who
invented
the
rule
that
subjective
motivation
won't
defeat
a
qualified
motive
defense?
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
suggesting,
and
really
trying
to
be
helpful
to
you,
that
the
court
has
not
always
relied
on
more
traditional
forms
of
lawmaking
in
this
whole
area
of
the
law.
unknown
speaker
absolute
immunity
also
came
from
the
courts,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
really...
i
got
that
from
your
brief.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
that
one.
i
mean,
the
purpose
of
this
would
be,
there
are
a
lot
of
claims
that
if
you
knew
what
the
person
was
claiming,
you'd
say
to
the
plaintiff,
what
is
your
point,
and
by
the
time
he
explained
his
point,
you
would
see
there
was
no
case.
but
sometimes,
there
is
a
case,
and
of
course,
if
when
he's
explained
his
point
there
is
a
case,
why
should
you
impose
a
greater
burden
on
that
plaintiff
than
any
other
plaintiff
in
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
martinez.
mr.
rosenblatt,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
unknown
speaker
why
does
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
feel
impelled
to
invent
this
special
pleading
rule,
heightened
evidence
rule?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
