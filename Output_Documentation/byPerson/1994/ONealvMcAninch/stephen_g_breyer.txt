justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
second
case
is
robert
o'neal
v.
fred
mcaninch.
this
involves
the
following
situation,
a
defended
is
convicted
of
a
crime
in
a
state
court,
he
comes
into
a
federal
habeas
court
and
he
claims
that
there
was
a
constitutional
error
that
infected
the
trial
for
example
of
his
conviction.
the
court
decides
he
is
right,
there
was
a
constitutional
error,
but
still
he
does
not
get
a
new
trial
if
the
matter
was
harmless.
the
question
presented
to
us
was
under
those
circumstances
who
has
to
prove
harmlessness
or
lack
of
harmlessness?
is
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
show
it
was
not
harmless
or
is
it
on
the
government
to
show
it
was
harmless?
what
we
decided
is
this,
normally
when
you
are
a
court
of
appeals
or
other
court
reviewing
the
transcript
of
a
trial.
the
judge
should
try
not
to
rely
upon
burdens
of
proof.
the
judge
should
read
the
transcript
in
the
record
and
make
up
his
or
her
own
mind.
in
those
rare
instances
where
the
judge
ends
up
in
grave
doubt,
then
we
think
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
show
that
there
was
not
harmlessness.
that
our
reasoning
that
if
that
there
was
harmlessness
that
the
burden
is
on
the
government,
it
shows
that
the
error
was
harmless.
a
reason
is
basically
itâ€™s
consistent
with
prior
president,
it
makes
the
law
uniform
and
for
reasons
that
we
spell
out
in
the
opinion
it
is
consistent
with
the
interest
of
justice.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
have
joined.
