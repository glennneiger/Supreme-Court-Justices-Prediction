justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
this
was
your
view
prior
to
the
decision
in
brecht,
because
it
was
a
civil
proceeding
the
harmless
error
inquiry
burden
was
on
the
petitioner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
the
chapman
standard,
who
had
the
burden,
in
a
habeas
corpus
civil
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
the
chapman
standard,
of
course,
arose
on
direct
review
cases
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
had
been
applied
by
a
number
of
courts
in
the
habeas
context
before
brecht.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
that
time,
when
that
standard
was
being
applied
in
the
civil
proceeding,
under
your
view,
who
had
the
burden?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
was
a
civil
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have...
let
me
just
cut
you
off
for
just
a
second
there.
what
is
your
best
authority
for
the
proposition
that
in
a
trial
which
has
admittedly
been
affected
by
constitutional
error,
the
presumption
nevertheless
remains
that
the
judgment
should
be
respected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
have
a
specific
case
on
the
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
have
a
case
that
says,
in
effect,
what
you've
been
saying,
that
even
though
there's
been
constitutional
error
in
arriving
at
a
judgment,
the
presumption
nevertheless
remains
that
the
judgment
should
stand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
wouldn't
it
be
affected
to
this
extent,
that
if
you
take
seriously
the
language
about
looking
at
the
entire
record
and
weighing
it
against
the
entire
record,
that
somebody
has
to
decide
whether
it's
worth
the
judge's
time
to
say,
let's
look
at
the
whole
record
in
this
case?
if
you
go
with
the
petitioner,
the
government
has
to
make
up
its
mind
that
it
thinks
its
worth
the
effort.
if
they
don't,
neither
side
decides
it's
worth
the
effort,
then
the
judge
just
goes
ahead
and
grants
relief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
right.
if
the
government
doesn't
bear
the
risk,
or
if
the
government
does
bear
the
risk,
presumably
it
won't
raise...
make
a
serious
argument
on
it
unless
it
thinks
it
has
a
pretty
good
basis
for
asking
the
judge
to
read
this
whole
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
the
plaintiff
in
every
case
should
ask
the
judge
to
conduct
a
harmless
error...
to
be
sure
he
is...
that
it's
not
harmless.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
view
would
require
the
judge
in
every
case
to
read
the
record
and
conduct
harmless
error
review.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
i
mean,
he's
going
to
have
to
do
it
in
every
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
why,
but
i
think
there
is
a
very
significant
difference
in
work
load
on
the
court
on
which
view
one
takes,
because
if
the
government
doesn't
think
it's...
thinks
it's
close
enough
so
they're
probably
not
going
to
prevail
on
harmless
error,
they
just
don't
ask
the
judge
to
read
the
record,
but
the
petitioner
would
always
have
to
ask
him
to
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
point
is
that
he
has
to
make
it
as
part
of
his
petition,
and
they
may
not
even
call
for
a
rule
to
show...
they
may
not
issue
a
rule
to
show
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas,
if
you
take
the
other
view,
at
least
he
can
issue
the
rule
to
show
cause,
and
then
they
bring
in
the
harmless
error
inquiry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
therefore
whether
it
calls
for
a
response
from
the
other--
