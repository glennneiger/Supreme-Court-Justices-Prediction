justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
you
do
not
prevail
in
this
case,
and
a
court
looks
at
all
the
evidence
and
concludes,
we're
not
sure
what
would
have
happened,
but
this
had
a
significant
influence
on
the
jury's
determination,
it
was
a
close
case,
it
was...
we
just
don't
know,
what
result
under
the
standard
that
you
are
proposing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
and
what
result
under
the
standard
that
the
state
and
the
government
are
proposing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
as
you
interpret
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
government
and
the
state
are
arguing
for,
the
petitioner
has
to
show
what,
that
there
likely
would
have
been
a
different
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
know
that.
what
about
the
effect
on
the
verdict?
what
does
the
petitioner
have
to
show
under
the
state's
proposal,
as
you
understand
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that
mean
it's
more
likely
that
not
that
the
verdict
would
have
been
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
grave
doubt,
in
your
view,
if
the
judge
looks
at
the
case
and
he
or
she
says,
i
just
can't
tell?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
think
that
a
grant
of
the
writ
would
be
consistent
with
the
government's
position
to
the
standard
in
the
case
that
we've
just
put?
grave
doubt,
even
under
the
government's
standard--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
writ
is
granted?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
under
the
government's
standard
the
writ
is
granted
if
there's
grave
doubt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
shouldn't
we--
--so
your
test
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
showing
that
it
actually
affected
the
verdict?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that,
in
the
hypothetical
i
put
to
petitioner's
counsel,
where
the
judge
is
just
in
doubt,
we
assume
a
constitutional
error,
let's
say
an
un-mirandized
statement
is
introduced,
it's
a
very
close
case,
i
just
don't
know,
petitioner
loses,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
you
go
about
making
that
determination
in
a
really
close
case?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
the
jury's
going
to
come
out.
i
just
don't
know.
that
means
petitioner
has
to
lose.
how
does
he
go
about
overcoming
this
burden?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're
assuming
they
show
a
constitutional
error.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
cordray,
if
the
petitioner
were
to
prevail
here,
would
there
be
a
significant
practical
effect
on
the
work
load
of
the
state
prosecutors
in
defending
against
habeas
applications?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
no...
i
take
it
that
the
trial
court
also
has
the
option
to
say...
to
address
the
constitutional
issue
first
and
say
there's
no
constitutional
violation,
in
which
case
he
doesn't
have
to
read
the
record
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
should
think
if
there
is
a
constitutional
violation,
then
he's
going
to
have
to
read
the
record,
and
one
party
or
the
other
has
the
burden
to
persuade.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
suppose
all
you're
saying
is
that
the
petitions
will
be
bigger.
i
don't
think
the
work
of
the
court's
any
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
back
where
we're
started.
that's
not
true
if
the
judge
says
there's
no
constitutional
violation
here,
i'm
not
going
to
read
this
record,
i
don't
have
to.
