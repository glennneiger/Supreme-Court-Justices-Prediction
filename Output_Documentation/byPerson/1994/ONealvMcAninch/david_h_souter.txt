justice
david
h.
souter
do
i
understand
you,
i
guess
going
back
to
your
answer
to
the
question
by
justice
kennedy,
that
you
regard
the
issue
in
this
case
as
being
both
about
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
quantum
of
proof,
or
do
you,
on
the
other
hand,
say
the
only
thing
that
is
before
us
is
the
question
of
who
has
the
burden,
and
the
quantum
of
what
would
be
necessary
to
carry
that
burden
is
a
separate
issue
for
a
separate
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
the
substantial
contribution
is
in
fact--
justice
david
h.
souter
--a
statement
of
quantum
of
proof.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
rule
your
way,
could
a
sound
argument
be
made
in
direct
review
chapman
cases
that
the
burden
should,
in
fact,
be
in
that
case
on
the
appellant,
because
although
you...
i
mean,
you
have
de
novo
review
of
the
strictly
legal
issue,
the
question
of
prejudice
is
not
that
kind
of
an
issue,
and
why
shouldn't,
if
we
go
your
way
here,
why
shouldn't
the
appellants
likewise
have
the
burden
to
prove
that
in
fact
there
was
actual
prejudice?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
it...
you
say
it's
a
direct
continuation,
but
the
parties
don't
stand
in
the
same
relation
to
each
other
in
terms
of
their
obligations
to
go
forward.
there
is
at
least
an
intellectual
burden
that
has
to
be
satisfied
by
the
appellant
to
prove
that
there
was
legal
error,
so
they're
not
in
the
same
spot
they're
in
at
the
moment
the
jury's
empaneled.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
kind
of...
isn't
that
sort
of
begging
the
question?
the
question
is,
should
it
be,
and
we
don't...
why
should
we
have
a
rule
that
assumes
prejudice?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
really
think
that
probably
the
strongest
answer,
then,
to
my
question
is
one
of
statutory
interpretation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
then
saying
it's...
basically
it's
a
question
of
statutory
construction,
that
so
far
as
the
so-called
policy
arguments
might
go,
you
could
make
just
as
strong
an
argument
for
placing
the
burden
on
the
appellant
under
chapman
as
you
can
for
placing
the
burden
on
the
petitioner
here
under
kotteakos?
