mr.
richard
a.
cordray
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
to
reframe,
the
single
issue
on
which
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
is
whether
the
habeas
petitioner
or
the
habeas
respondent
bears
the
burden
of
showing
that
any
error
identified
at
trial
was
of
such
magnitude
that
it
actually
had
a
substantial
and
injurious
effect
in
determining
the
jury's
verdict.
it
is
our
position
that
the
habeas
petitioner
properly
bears
this
burden,
as
stated
in
brecht,
for
two
reasons:
first,
this
is
consistent
with
the
nature
of
habeas
proceedings
as
civil
actions.
second,
this
is
consistent
with
the
longstanding
tenor
of
this
court's
habeas
jurisprudence,
which
recognizes
that
a
collateral
challenge
to
a
separate
and
distinct
state
court
judgment
requires
the
party
initiating
the
collateral
challenge
to
make
all
the
showings
necessary
to
justify
setting
aside
that
state
court
judgment.
and
justice
o'connor,
i
think
you
are
correct
to
note
that
a
habeas
action,
this
court
has
long
held,
is
a
civil
action.
that
means
that
the
petitioner,
who,
in
essence,
is
the
plaintiff
in
the
case,
must
make
all
the
showings
necessary
to
justify
relief,
and
this
is,
in
essence,
an
element
of
the
claim
necessary
to
show
a
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
there
must
be
a
causal
link,
as
the
solicitor
general
submitted
in
the
brief
for
the
united
states,
between
the
error
and
the
verdict
to
justify
relief
here.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
your
honor,
i
think
that
prior
to
brecht
the
general
understanding,
and
i
guess
the
court
said
in
brecht
it
had
not
yet
confronted
it
specifically,
was
that
the
chapman
standard
would
be
applied
in
these
cases.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
well,
the
chapman
standard,
i
believe,
your
honor,
was
a
criminal
law
formulation,
which
said
that
the
state
must
show
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that
is
appropriate
in--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
believe--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--because
this
court
specifically
stated
under
the
chapman
standard
that
the
state
had
the
burden,
the
state
did
have
the
burden
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yes,
although
that's
not
consistent
with
the
general
tenor
of
civil
proceedings.
it
was
an
exception
to
the
historical
rule,
and
that's...
when
the
petitioner
points
to
the
traditional
body
of
case
law,
they're
really
only
pointing
to
the
chapman
case
and
the
chapman
approach,
otherwise
the
consistent
tenor
of
this
court's
case
law
in
a
habeas
proceeding
is
that
the
petitioner,
the
one
bringing
a
collateral
challenge
to
a
separate
and
distinct
state
court
judgment,
must
make
all
the
showings
necessary
to
justify
relief,
which
includes--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--yes,
but
your
honor,
i
think
when
this
court
in
brecht
specifically
confronted
the
issue
and
said
that
the
chapman
approach
is
not
appropriate
on
collateral
review,
it
was
setting
aside
the
chapman
approach,
which
was
a
criminal
law
formulation
that
the
state
must
show
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
instead
was
returning
to
this
court's
traditional
habeas
principles
as
stated
in
cases
like
adams,
where
justice
frankfurter
for
the
court
said
that
it
is
not
asking
for
too
much
if
the--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--yes,
but--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--because
i
think
that
with
chapman
the
court
carried
in
a
criminal
law
formulation,
and
i
think
that
the
court's
application
of
kotteakos
both
before
and
since,
palmer
v.
hoffman,
mcdonough
power,
is
that
in
a
civil
proceeding
the
party
seeking
to
set
aside
the
judgment
must
bear
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
error
actually
affected
the
result
in
the
case
such
as
to
influence
its
substantial
rights,
and
that's
the
appropriate
formulation,
we
believe,
in
this
case.
in
particular,
justice
ginsburg,
to
return
to
the
question
you
asked
of
the
petitioner,
we
do
not
understand
that
the
analysis
here
on
this
issue
would
be
an
affirmative
defense
that
the
state
must
raise.
that
would
not
be
consistent
with
the
court's
habeas
jurisprudence.
instead,
what
would
be
consistent
is
to
treat
it
as
the
court
has
treated
procedural
default
in
mccleskey,
in
coleman,
exhaustion
in
granberry
v.
greer,
as
a
matter
that
the
state
must
raise,
or
it
may
waive
it,
but
once
raised,
the
burden
is
on
the
petitioner
to
make
the
showings
necessary
to
justify
relief,
and
we
think
that
that's
what's
consistent
with
the
court
habeas
jurisprudence.
and
we
think
that
that's
true
because
the
fundamental
nature
of
these
proceedings
again
is
they
are
collateral
challenges
to
separate
and
distinct
state
court
judgments.
this
court
has
held
in
all
such
collateral
proceedings
such
as
in
park
v.
raley,
two
terms
ago,
that
the
burden
is
on
the
parties
seeking
to
challenge
that
judgment,
which
is
now
presumed
to
be
final,
and
the
presumption
of
finality
has
attached
when
it's
been
upheld
on
direct
appeal,
to
make
the
showings
necessary
to
justify
setting
aside
that
judgment,
and
it
is
also
consistent
with
this
court's
touchstone
principles
of
its
habeas
jurisprudence,
which
stress
that
there
are
interests
that
the
state
and
its
citizens
share
here
that
are
felt
in
very
human
terms
by
the
state
and
its
citizens.
this
goes
directly,
if
we
have
endless
relitigation
in
these
issues,
to
the
return
effect
of
the
criminal
laws
which
is
felt
in
all
of
our
communities
and
neighborhoods.
it
goes
directly
to
public
confidence
in
the
judicial
system.
it
erodes
that
confidence
which
is
necessary
if
we're
going
to
secure
the
voluntary
cooperation
of
citizens
who
are
victims
of
crime,
witnesses
to
events.
as
this
court
said
in
engle
v.
isaac,
quoting
an
article,
famous
article
by
the
late
professor
bator
on
habeas
and
finality,
it
also
goes
to
the
rehabilitation
of
the
offender,
because
one
who
doesn't
yet
recognize
that
they
stand
fully
and
finally
convicted
is
not
prepared
to
undertake
rehabilitation,
and
these
are
very
important
interests
that
the
state
and
its
citizens
feel,
i
would
stress,
in
very
human
terms.
and
the
presumption
of
finality,
if
it
means
anything,
means
that
when
a
petitioner
has
not
succeeded
in
showing
that
error
identified
at
trial
actually
had
an
effect
on
the
jury's
verdict,
a
substantial
injurious
effect,
it
is
not
appropriate
to
presume,
then,
that
the
state
court
judgment
should
be
set
aside.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
that
is
the
test
that--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
think
that
that
is...
yes,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
only
posture
that's
consistent
with
the
presumption
of
finality
that
this
court
has
stressed
attaches
in
habeas
cases.
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
state
court
judgment
should
be
upheld,
rather
than
set
aside,
where
the
petitioner
has
not
succeeded
in
making
all
the
showings
necessary
to
justify
relief,
and
that
is
what
the
presumption
of
finality
must
mean,
that
we
don't
presume,
in
a
close
case,
that
the
state
court
judgment
be
set
aside.
instead,
we
presume
that
it
should
be
upheld.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
think
that
in
these
cases,
in
every
case,
the
petitioner
attempts
to
show
constitutional
error.
the
state,
of
course,
attempts
to
show
that
there
was
not
constitutional
error.
the
petitioner
also--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
understand.
and
petitioner
will
also
attempt
to
show
substantial
injurious
effect
on
the
jury's
verdict,
and
the
state
will
attempt
to
show,
no,
that's
not
the
case,
but
there
are
substantial
safeguards
that
are
built
into
this
process
for
a
habeas
petitioner.
this
court
has
stressed
that
it
is
a
plenary
federal
review
of
the
issue,
it
is
a
de
novo
review
undertaken
on
the
entire
record
in
the
case,
and
third,
and
maybe
most
important,
it
is
a
matter
of
judgment
that
involves
a
qualitative
assessment
of
the
effect
of
the
error
on
the
jury's
verdict,
and
not
simply
a
simplistic
assessment
of
guilt,
and
it's
those
safeguards
that
the
lower
courts
have
applied
consistent
with
this
court's
brecht
decision.
and
i
think
that
petitioner's
claim
before
this
court
is
that
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
placed
here,
as
the
court
has
consistently
historically
placed
it
in
habeas
cases,
excepting
only
the
chapman
approach,
that
there
will
somehow
be
an
end
to
this
court's
habeas
jurisprudence
safeguarding
the
liberty
rights
of
offenders.
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
the
lower
courts
have
faithfully
applied
brecht
in
the
spirit
of
that
decision,
they
have
made
this
full,
de
novo
review
on
the
record,
they
have
granted
writs
under
this
standard,
in
the
cumbie
case
out
of
the
eleventh
circuit,
the
jeffries
case
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
cited
in
our
brief,
and
we
think
that
there
are
those
substantial
safeguards
built
in
for
the
petitioner,
the
offender.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
we
would
agree
with
the
solicitor
general,
though
we
don't
have
any
statistical
analysis,
this
would
be
a
narrow
class
of
cases.
but
in
this
narrow
class
of
cases,
we
think
this
raises
a
very
fundamental
point
about
the
philosophy
of
this
court's
jurisprudence,
which
is,
in
the
close
case,
are
we
going
to,
in
the
end,
presume
that
the
state
court
judgment,
separate
and
distinct
judgment,
should
be
set
aside,
or
are
we
going
to
presume
that
it's
going
to
be
upheld,
and
the
petitioner,
this
court
has
always
held,
is
the
one
who
must
make
those
showings.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
your
honor,
i
think
our
authority
for
that
is
the
tenor
of
this
court's
habeas
jurisprudence
dating
back
to
adams.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
dating
back
to
adams
v.
united
states,
and
also
the
court's
brecht
decision
itself,
that
where
you
have
error,
you
don't
know
what
effect
it
has
on
the
jury's
verdict
until
a
showing
is
made,
and
the
court
said
it
must
be
a
substantial
injurious
effect,
and
petitioner
must
make
that
showing
to
show
that--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--we
think
that
all
of
the
cases
this
court
has
decided
on
habeas...
granberry
v.
greer,
which
is
an
exhaustion
case,
procedural
default
cases,
abuse
of
the
writ
cases,
and
all
of
those
cases,
there
are
allegations
and
perhaps
identification
of
error,
but
to
the
point
is
that
the
petitioner
must
make
the
showings
necessary
to
justify
relief,
to
show
a
causal
link
between
the
error
and
the
jury's
verdict,
such
that
we
now
can
know
with
some
assurance
that
the
custody
here
is
actually
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
no,
it
does
not.
there
are
some
errors,
your
honor,
that
the
court
has
recognized
are
reversible
per
se.
however,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
class
of
errors
that
are
constitutional
trial
errors
where
the
court
has
said
there
must
be
a
further
showing
that
the
error
actually
affected
the
jury's
verdict,
and
if
there's
no
such
showing,
if
there
is
no
such
link
drawn
by
the
petitioner
in
the
case,
then
the
state
court
judgment
should
not
be
presumed
to
be
set
aside.
we
think
that
that
is
consistent
with
the
longstanding
tenor
of
this
court's
habeas
jurisprudence.
it's
also
consistent,
again,
with
the
nature
of
a
habeas
proceeding
as
a
civil
action.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yes,
it
would.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
think
it
raises,
your
honor,
a
separate
question,
and
this
question
was
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
here
as
question
1,
and
it's
a
question
that
some
of
the
courts
have
wrestled
with.
if
there
was
no
chapman
standard
applied
on
direct
review,
should
it
be
chapman,
then,
that
is
applied
on
collateral
review,
and
thus
far
the
court
has
declined
to
take
up
that
issue,
and
i
think
correctly,
because
the
court
laid
down
a
single,
consistent
standard
in
brecht
that
should
apply
on
all
collateral
review
cases,
but
that's...
i
would
stress
here
that
that's
a
separate
question.
there
was
a
question
1
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
was
denied
review
here,
and
so
i
don't
think
that
question
is
present
in
the
case
at
this
point.
at
least,
we've
not
briefed
it
or
presented
it
to
the
court.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
think
that's
right,
because
the
court
denied
review
on
that
question.
we
think
that
brecht
answers
it
pretty
clearly,
that
that
is
the
brecht
standard
that
will
apply
on
collateral
review,
not
the
chapman
standard.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
think
here
are
two
reasons,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
on
a
direct
review
you
have
an
appeal
that
is
a
continuation,
a
direct
continuation
of
the
underlying
criminal
proceeding,
and
so
the
criminal
law
formulation
of
chapman--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
think
those
observations
are
correct,
your
honor.
there
might
be
some
argument
made,
but
i
think
that
neither
of
the
arguments
would
really
apply
with
much
force
in
that
setting
because
the
appeal
there
is
a
continuation
of
the
underlying
criminal
proceeding.
it
also
is
not
a
collateral
challenge.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
think
that,
as
your
honor
indicates,
that
is
a
separate
question
as
to
whether
chapman
is
an
appropriate
standard
on
direct
review.
the
state
does
not
challenge
that,
and
neither
do
we
think
that
either
of
the
arguments
we
are
resting
so
heavily
on
here
really
would
apply
to
suggest
that
chapman
is
inappropriate
on
direct
review,
because
that
is
still
a
criminal
proceeding,
and
it
also
doesn't
involve
a
collateral
challenge
to
a
separate
and
distinct
judgment.
and
i
think
that
in
particular
the
court
here
has
indicated
that
on
a
2254
proceeding,
the
rules
this
court
has
adopted
implementing
2254,
rule
11
specifically
points
the
courts
to
draw
upon
the
federal
civil
rules
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
and
the
federal
civil
rules,
as
i
indicated,
have
always
been
applied
going
back
to
palmer
v.
hoffman,
1943,
reaffirmed
in
mcdonough
power--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
think
that
the
court...
my
sense
would
be
the
court
would
consider
that
it
has
directly
considered
the
chapman
standard
on
direct
review
of
criminal
cases,
and
considers
that
to
be
the
correct
approach.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
agree,
and
those
are
the
things
i'm
trying
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yes,
i
agree,
and
i'm
trying
to
articulate
that.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
policy
arguments,
or
the
fundamental
touchstone
interest
this
court
has
stressed
applying
collateral
review
of
on
habeas
proceedings
are
distinct.
the
presumption
of
finality
only
attaches
once
a
conviction
has
been
upheld
all
the
way
on
direct
appeal,
and
only
then
do
the
interests
that
i
attempted
to
articulate
of
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
criminal
laws,
the
public
confidence
in
the
judicial
system
that
this
court
stressed
in
brecht
and
has
stressed
in
a
number
of
cases,
really
do
begin
to
apply,
as
this
court
has
said,
once
the
case
goes
over
to
collateral
review
in
a
distinct
proceeding,
and
so
i
think
that
is
a
distinct
matter.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
very
clear
from
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
that
first
of
all
they
found
that
there
was
no
error
in
the
jury
instruction.
it
was
a
proper...
perhaps
not
ideal,
but
a
proper
statement
of
ohio
law
and
complicity
and
conspiracy
that
intent
to
kill
can
be
presumed
from
circumstances,
including
a
common
design
to
enter
into
a
crime
that
is
reasonably
likely
to
cause
the
death
of
the
victim.
however,
more
than
that,
the
court
only
assumed
arguendo
that
there
was
error,
perhaps,
in
a
combination
of
jury
instruction
with
prosecutorial
comment,
and
so
if
the
court
were
to
disagree
with
us
as
to
the
allocation
of
burden
of
proof,
we
think
both
sides
would
agree
that
remand
would
be
appropriate
first
for
the
sixth
circuit
to
actually
determine
if
there
was
error,
and
second,
whether,
under
a
different
allocation
of
burden
of
proof,
that
the
verdict
should
be
upheld
nonetheless.
but
again,
we
think
that
it
is
very
clear
that
in
a
collateral
challenge,
a
civil
action
habeas
proceeding,
the
burden
should
be
allocated
here
to
the
habeas
petitioner
to
make
the
showing
necessary
to
justify
relief,
to
show
that
the
presumption
of
finality
should
be
set
aside,
and
that
that's
consistent
with
the
court's
view
of
habeas
proceedings
as
only
correcting
extreme
malfunctions
in
the
state
court
process
that
have
grievously
wronged
an
offender.
if
the
habeas
petitioner
is
unable
to
show
that
error
actually
had
effect
on
the
jury's
verdict,
actually
had
a
substantial
injurious
effect,
we
would
submit
that
the
state
court
system
has
not
extremely
malfunctioned,
it
has
not
grievously
wronged
the
habeas
petitioner.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
don't
think
that
the
allocation
of
the
burden
would
affect
the
work
load
one
way
or
the
other,
because
both
parties
always
have
every
incentive
to
present
their
best
arguments
as
to
whether
there
is
error,
and
as
to
whether
that
error
actually
had
an
effect
on
the
jury's
verdict.
what
it
will
affect
is
the
approach
that
state
courts...
that
federal
courts
take
philosophically
whether
they
should
set
aside
state
judgments
merely
based
on
a
presumption
or
instead
should
accord
them
the
presumption
of
finality
that
this
court
has
stressed
so
long
and
so
consistently.
