mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
the
habeas
petitioner
should
bear
the
burden
of
proof
as
to
harmless
error.
that's
not
based
on
an
analysis
of
section
2111,
the
harmless
error
statute,
or
the
federal
rules
of
civil
or
criminal
procedure,
because
in
our
view
those
rules
were
primarily
designed
to
deal
with
errors
that
occur
in
a
federal
proceeding
from
the
time
the
proceeding
was
started
until
the
time
the
court
is
asked
to
assess
the
effect
of
some
error
that's
occurred.
instead,
it's
based
on
the
fact...
this
case
does
not
involve
that
kind
of
a
situation.
the
error
that
occurred
here
occurred
in
a
state
court
proceeding
that
was
finished
and
came
to
final
judgment
before
the
federal
proceeding
was
instituted.
in
those
circumstances,
in
our
view
the
crucial
point
is
that
there
has
been
a
final
judgment
in
the
prior
proceeding,
and
that
that
is
what
is
being
attacked.
the
habeas
petitioner
bears
the
burden
of
proving
that
an
error
was
committed
in
that
proceeding,
and
for
essentially
the
same
reasons,
we
think
the
habeas
petitioner
bears
the
burden
also
of
showing
that
that
error
was
not
harmless,
that
it
had
some
effect
on
the
outcome.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
i
would
agree
with
that,
if
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
number
of
cases
that
are
likely
to
be
affected.
i
can't
give
you
an
empirical
survey,
or
empirical
results,
but
if
you
look
through
f.
2d,
and
look
through
appellate
decisions,
there
are
dozens
of
appellate
decisions
that
have
addressed
harmless
error
after
having
found
error
on
habeas.
most
of
them
don't
even
mention
the
concept
of
burden
of
proof,
and
at
least
my
sense
of
looking
at
them
is
that
it's
not
ordinarily
the
decisive
question,
so
i
don't
think
it
would
affect
a
very
large
number
of
cases.
on
the
other
hand,
in
cases
where
it
will
affect
things,
it
can
have...
it
can
be
a
very
extremely
important
issue.
in
this
case,
for
instance,
the
petitioner
was
originally
tried
14
years
ago.
the
possibilities
of
retrying
him
at
this
time,
it
would
be
very
difficult,
and
the
confidence
in
the
outcome
of
that
proceeding
that
would
result
in
a
just
conviction
if
he
turned
out
to
be...
if
he
was
guilty
would
be
severe.
it's
for
those
reasons
that
the
habeas
corpus
statute
specifically
speaks
in
terms
of
the...
what
the
petitioner
must
show
is
that
he's
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
not
that
he's
in
custody
pursuant
to
a
judgment
rendered
at
a
trial
at
which
a
constitutional
error
occurred.
in
our
view,
because
he
must
be
shown
to
be
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
that
imports
a
notion
of
causation
which
is
essentially
what--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
wouldn't...
what
i
would
extract
from
that
is
simply
that
the
claim
that
the
habeas
petitioner
must
make
out
is
that
he's
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
and
that
it
is
an
element
of
that
claim.
his
custody
isn't
a
violation
of
the
constitution
unless
there
was
an
error
that
occurred
and
that
error
had
some
relationship
to
his
custody.
that
is,
the
error
caused
his
custody
in
some
sense,
and
that,
in
that
sense,
is
what
the
harmless
error
rules
are
about.
it
is
because
that
is
one
element
of
his
claim
that
he
must
show
that
it's
up
to
the...
it's
because
it's
an
element
of
his
claim
that
he
must
make
that
he
must
make
the...
carry
the
burden
of
proof
as
to
harmless
error.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
suppose
you
could.
i
mean,
i
think,
first,
all
of
the
policies
that
this
court
has
referred
to
time
and
time
again
about
the
very
great
cost
imposed
by
habeas
relief
would
not
apply
in
a
situation
of
direct
review.
i
think
also
the
court's
repeatedly
said
habeas
is
not
supposed
to
serve
the
function
of
a
direct
appeal.
and
i
would
finally
point
out
that
rule
52(a)
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
to
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
government
of
showing
harmless
error
once
there's
been
an
error
that's
been
shown
by
the
defendant.
so
i
think
that's
squarely
governed
by
those
rules.
it
may
be
reasonable
on
direct
review
for
a
court,
when
the
court
is
in
equipoise
as
to
whether
or
not
an
error
had
a
substantial
and
injurious
effect
on
the
verdict,
it
may
be
reasonable
for
that
court
to
overturn
the
conviction
and
send
it
back
for
a
new
trial.
but
on
habeas,
where
the
court
is
not
able
positively
to
state
that
the
error
did
have
such
a
substantial
injurious
effect
on
the
verdict,
i
think
that
the
petitioner
hasn't
made
out
his
claim
and
that
the
habeas
petition
should
be
denied.
petitioner
has
argued
that
the
result
in
this
case
will
affect
the
procedures,
and
that
there's...
i
disagree
with
the
petitioner
that
there
is
a
procedural
rule
that
a
court
has
to
determine
either
harmless
error
or
whether
the
error
occurred,
in
what
order
the
court
has
to
determine
those
two
questions.
a
court
can
reasonably
act
by
assuming
that
an
error
has
occurred
and
asking
itself
whether
it's
harmless,
or
they
can
find
out
whether
the
error
occurred
and
then
conduct
a
harmless
error
review.
i
don't
think
that
the
order
of
proof
will
be
affected
by
the
result
in
this
case,
nor
do
i
think
that
the
introduction
of
evidence,
or
the
burdens
of
showing
what
facts
might
be
relevant,
is
going
to
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
as
i
understand
the
question,
if
you're
referring
to
a
burden
of
production,
it's
not
really
the
question
that
we've
addressed.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
agree
that
that's
vital,
because
i
think
the
issue
will
inevitably
surface,
but
what
we're
really...
the
issue
that
i'm
more
interested
in
in
this
case
is,
who
bears
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion?
that
is,
where
the
court
as
a
substantive
matter--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
don't...
i
think
if
the
government
approaches
the
case
and
finds
that
an
error
has
been
committed,
i
don't
think
it
should
ask
the
court
to
conduct
a
harmless
error
analysis
unless
it
can
conclude
that
that
analysis--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
if
the
petitioner...
i
think
if
the
petitioner
views...
thinks
that
that's
a
sound
claim
that
he
ought
to
be
making,
that
i
think...
yeah,
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that's
right.
well,
i
think
petitioner...
i
think
that
is
because
there
has
been
already
a
final
judgment
in
the
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
ordinarily,
once
there's
been
a
final
conviction
that's
been
affirmed
and
you're
on
habeas,
ordinarily
the
government
will
take
the
position
that
that
conviction
is
valid
and
will
litigate
the
harmless
error
issue
if
there's
a
good
reason
to
litigate
it.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
i
agree.
of
course,
that
would
be
the...
i
think
that
is
certainly
the
ordinary
way
of
proceeding,
but
i
just
wanted
to
make
the
point
before
that
i
don't
think
it's
the
exclusive
or
required
way
for
the
court
to
proceed.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
i
agree.
in
this
court's
decision
in
brecht
v.
abrahamson,
the
court
did
say
that
it
adopted...
in
adopting
the
kotteakos
standard
that
lower
federal
courts
will
have
a
substantial...
will
have
an
understanding
of
what
that
standard
means,
because
there's
been
a
lot
of
case
law
that's
developed
around
it,
but
i
think
that
when
the
court
said
that,
it
certainly
did
not
say
that
that
was
compelled
by
the
harmless
error
statute
or
by
the
federal
rules,
certainly
not
by
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
nor
was
it
addressing
the
burden
of
proof
issue.
indeed,
as
to
that
point,
the
experience
of
the
lower
federal
courts,
chapman
and
kotteakos
were
equal.
the
lower
federal
courts
had
had
very
substantial
experience
at
that
time
in
dealing
with
both
standards.
it
was
a
necessary
condition,
perhaps,
for
the
court
to
adopt
the
kotteakos
standard,
that
this
court
would
have
had
confidence
that
what
it
was
adopting
would
be
understood
by
the
lower
federal
courts,
but
i
don't
think
it
was
a
sufficient
condition,
and
i
certainly
wouldn't
read
into
that
any
statement
about
the
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
issue.
it
was
just
that
this
standard,
substantial
and
injurious
effect
on
the
verdict,
was
something
that
the
lower
federal
courts
would
be
able
to
understand
what
it
means,
because
there's
been
a
lot
of
case
law
developed
about
that
in
a
number
of
circumstances.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
