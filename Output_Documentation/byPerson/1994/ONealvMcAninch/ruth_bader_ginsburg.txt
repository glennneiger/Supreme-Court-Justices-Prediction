justice

is
it
your
position
that
the
substantive
standard
that
you
get
out
of
kotteakos
makes
the
linkage
question
a
matter
of
affirmative
defense,
if
we
take
the
civil
case
model,
that
your
burden
is
to
show
the
constitutional
violation?
once
you
show
that,
there's
some
kind
of
presumption
operating
in
your
favor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
showing
substantial
likelihood
of
contributing
to
the
conviction...
my
question
is,
if
you
take
the
civil
case
model,
is
that
showing
an
element
of
your
case,
or
is
it
more
properly
regarded
as
an
affirmative
defense
on
the
part
of
the
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
yet
when
chapman
was
carried
over
to
a
civil
proceeding,
a
habeas
proceeding,
it
was
assumed
that
the
distribution
of
the
persuasion
burden
would
be
the
same.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
also
picking
up
a
standard
from
the
criminal
context...
just
as
chapman
came
from
the
criminal
context,
so
did
kotteakos.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
wouldn't
it
follow
that
then
you
take
the
standard
from
the
criminal
context,
and
you
also
take
the
allocation
of
burdens?
it
was
just
a
substitution
of
one
for
the
other.
why,
when
chapman
didn't
shift
the
burden
to
kind
of
a
civil
format,
would
the
kotteakos
formula
do
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
direct
review
the
standard
would
remain
chapman,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
was
no
such
application
of
chapman
here
in
the
state
court,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
make
no
difference
at
all?
does
it
make
a
difference
that
when
you
come
over
to
collateral
review
you
either
have
had
in
the
state
courts
a
chapman-style
review
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
would
remain
an
open
question
however
we
decide
this
allocation
of
the
burden
of
persuasion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
that
the
practical
consequences
of
a
decision
one
way
or
another
are
slight?
that
is,
that
there
are
not
many
cases
where
the
trier
is
in
equipoise
about
the
linkage
between
the
constitutional
violation
and
the
impact
on
the
conviction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it
odd
to
extract
a
burden
of
proof
rule
from
a
statute
that
doesn't
even
tell
us
what
the
substantive
standard
is
in
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
that
your
main
complaint
is
that
the
courts
will
say,
never
mind
there
was
a
constitutional
violation,
we
won't
bother
with
that,
we'll
see
if
you've
proved
a
connection,
if
you
haven't
proved
a
connection,
we'll
never
get
to
the
constitutional
violation,
instead
of
the
other
way
around?
is
that
in
essence
what
your
problem
is?
