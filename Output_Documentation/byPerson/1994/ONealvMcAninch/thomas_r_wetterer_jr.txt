mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
robert
o'neal's
case
is
that
once
a
habeas
corpus
petitioner
has
proven
a
constitutional
violation,
does
the
state
then
have
the
burden
to
prove
the
constitutional
violation
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
under
kotteakos?
it
used
to
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
under
chapman.
this
court
adopted
the
kotteakos
standard,
which
reduced
the
burden
that
the
state
must
maintain,
and
with
the
reduction
of
the
burden
also
came
the
allocation
of
the
burden,
so
yes,
the
state
must
maintain
the
burden
of
proving
the
error
harmless.
with
kotteakos
came
the
kotteakos
case
law.
as
in
justice
stevens'
case,
justice
stevens'
concurrence
indicated
that
placed
the
burden
of
proving
harmless
error
on
the
state
for
constitutional
claims.
this
was
consistent
with
all
the
court's
precedent
in
this
area
of
harmless
error
determination.
under
chapman,
the
burden
was
placed
upon
the
state
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
now
the
court
has
placed
the
burden
upon
the
state
to
prove
the
error
harmless,
with
no
substantial
and
injurious
effect
upon
the
verdict.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
and
that
was
the
issue
that
this
court
resolved
in
the
brecht
case,
and
didn't
make
a
different
result
by
reducing
the
burden
on
the
state
to
accommodate
the
interest
of
the
state
in
finality,
comity,
and
federalism.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
because
the
writ
would
no
longer
be
able
to
serve
the
purposes
that
this
court
has
placed
upon
it.
in
order
to
protect
the
factually
innocent
and
ensure
the
accurate
determination
of
guilt
and
innocence
in
the
trial
process,
and
to
protect
the
constitutional
rights,
the
burden
must
remain
with
the
state.
in
those
cases
in
which
there
is
an
equal
inference
on
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
has
met
his
claim
or
not,
traditionally
the
state
has
borne
that
risk
of
error
and
the
risk
that
the
constitutional
right
was
not
violated.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
under
the
current
case
law
it
indicates
that
not
as
many
as
would
under
other
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
in
habeas
corpus,
because
under
habeas
corpus
law,
under
fretwell,
the
court
is
supposed
to
first
determine
whether
a
constitutional
violation
has
been
made.
if
this
court
were
to
place
the
burden
upon
the
petitioner,
then
this
case
would
affect
every
case,
every
habeas
corpus
case
in
the
united
states,
because
then
the
court
would
then
have
to
determine
prejudice
as
part
of
the
determination
on
the
merits.
if
this
court
remains
the
burden
on
the
state
to
prove
harmless
error
once
the
petitioner
has
proven
a
constitutional
violation,
then
this
will
affect
a
few
cases,
because
under
the
chapman
standard
it
was
estimated
that
only
1
in
1,000
cases
warranted
any
review
under
the
chapman
standard.
it's
assumed
that
not
that
many
petitioners
will
make
the...
will
find
relief
under
the
lower
standard
of
kotteakos,
and
therefore
it
depends
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
whether
this
impact
has
a...
has
an
impact
in
every
federal
case
that
ever
comes
before
any
court
or
magistrate,
or
whether
this
decision
only
applies
in
those
situations
that
once
the
court
has
found
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights.
if
there's
been
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights
proven
by
the
petitioner,
that
has
met
the
interest
that
this
court
has
set
for
a
meeting
of
comity,
finality,
and
federalism
under
mccleskey.
at
that
point,
the
state
has
no
interest
in
a
constitutionally
defective
judgment.
under
the
kotteakos
standard,
this
court
has
said
that
when
there
is
grave
doubt
as
to
the
impact
of
the
error,
then
relief
is
to
be
granted,
and
that
is
those
cases
in
which
the
state
has
been
unable
to
demonstrate
that
the
error
did
not
affect
the
rights
of
the
case.
in
a
lot
of
cases,
it
will
be
very
clear
for
the
court
that
the
error
did
or
did
not
affect,
but
in
those
few
cases,
in
those
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
reviewed
the
record,
found
a
constitutional
violation,
and
then
have
been
unable
to
really
determine
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
but
they
have
grave
doubt,
and
those
cases
clearly
were
granted
relief
under
chapman
and
should
still
remain
to
be
granted
relief
under
kotteakos
and
brecht.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
under
this
standard,
the
kotteakos
standard,
the
new
trial
would
be
granted,
because
every--
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
--that
that
petitioner
would
remain
with
loss
of
life
or
liberty.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
the
petitioner
must
demonstrate
that
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation,
and
that
is
a
huge
hurdle
to
overcome
in
federal
habeas.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
under
the
state's
proposal,
the
petitioner
has
to
prove
that
it
actually
had
a
substantial
and
injurious
effect
upon
the
verdict,
and
then
besides--
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
--it
depends
upon
whether
the...
would
appear
that
there
would
be
a
conflict
with
kotteakos,
because
kotteakos
says
if
there's
grave
doubt
as
to
the
outcome,
then
you're
supposed
to
grant
relief--
the
state's
saying
that
we
have
to
prove
actual
prejudice.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
that's
grave
doubt
under
the
kotteakos
standard.
if
the
judge
can
say,
i
have
grave
doubts,
or
i
have
doubts
that
this
verdict
was
obtained
a
constitutional
manner,
and
then
we
have
found
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
the
government
standard
does
not--
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
government
wants
us
to
prove
actual
prejudice.
they
are
going
away
from
the
kotteakos
standard
and
saying
that
besides
proving
that
we
have
a
constitutional
claim,
we
have
to
prove
that
it
had
an
actual
impact
upon
the
jury.
not
that
there
is
grave
doubt,
or
surely
doubt,
but
that
there
was
an
actual
prejudice.
they're
relying
on
the
actual
prejudice
language
in
the
court's
earlier
decision.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
grave
doubt
as
to
prejudice,
yes,
your
honor.
this
court,
when
it
adopted
the
kotteakos
standard,
the
grave
doubt
standard
is
in
that
case
and
in
the
lower
case
law,
so
those
case
law
would
provide
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
which
they
can
use
in
determining
the
constitutional...
the
determination
of
whether
to
grant
a
writ.
in
order
to...
this
court
has
relied
upon
federal
habeas
to
provide
guidance
to
the
states
and
other
courts
as
to
what
the
constitution
means.
that
has
always
meant
that
the
courts
must
first
determine
a
constitutional
error,
then
determine
whether
impact.
if
there
was
a
merger,
as
the
state
is
asserting,
between
the
two
concepts,
then
habeas
would
no
longer
be
able
to
provide
any
guidance
to
the
courts,
because
every
time,
the
court
would
have
to
look
at
prejudice
as
part
of
the
constitutional
claim.
it
is
consistent
to
find
cases
in
which
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
and
a
person
may
be
entitled
to
relief
under
chapman
but
may
not
be
entitled
to
relief
under
the
kotteakos-brecht
standard.
the
state
courts
would
then
still
know
that
they
have
a
constitutional
violation
that
they
should
then
review
in
their
making
their
decisions.
this
court
grants
so
few
cert
petitions
on
direct
review
that
it
remains
necessary
for
this
court
to
maintain
that
difference.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
this
court
has
traditionally
relied
on
it
as
a
quasi-civil
action.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
however,
in
this
habeas
corpus
action
it
is
considered
by
most
a
quasi-criminal
and
civil
proceeding
because
it
protects
the
life
or
liberty
of
an
individual.
it's
not
the
same
as
when
someone
is
suing
over
whether
or
not
a
contract
has
been
breached
and
the
standard
is
beyond
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
this
court
has
set
the
kotteakos
standard
for
the
determination
of
whether
custody
is
the...
whether
or
not
a
violation
has
occurred.
that's
a
standard
for
the
court
to
decide,
and
the
petitioner
just
demonstrates
his
claim,
and
then
the
court
makes
a
decision
on
whether...
what
the
effect
of
that
is.
if
there's
been
a
finding
that
there
has
been
substantial
injurious
effect,
then
he
is
held
in
violation
of
his
custody,
but
traditionally
the
court
has
never
found
that
custody...
custody
has
always
equaled
whether
the
person
has
been
held
and
whether
the
court
can
grant
relief.
it
is
never
held
that...
in
recent
habeas
law
that
custody
means
that
the
petitioner
must
prove
prejudice
for
noncon...
for
constitutional
claims
in
federal
habeas.
it's
always
separated
out,
the
two
concepts,
because
by
merging
of
the
two
concepts,
we
don't
protect
the
people
that
habeas
is
supposed
to
protect.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
but
in
a
non...
but
you're
never
going
to
have,
in
a
civil
case,
your
honor,
a
situation
where
you
have
a
plaintiff
proving
that
the
state
has
violated
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
o'neal
has
demonstrated
that
the--
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
--in
those
civil
actions,
because
they're
going
for
monetary
damage,
they're
not
deprived
of
their
life
or
liberty
as
a
result
of
state
action.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
because,
your
honor,
mr.
o'neal
didn't...
isn't...
mr.
o'neal
was
found
to
have
a
constitutional
violation
at
his
trial.
he
did
not
receive
any
relief
on
that
in
state
court.
he's
now
come
into
federal
court
and
said
his
case
should
have
been
granted
relief,
and
under
chapman
he
would
have
been
granted
relief
by
the
district
court
finding.
now,
he's
wanting
to
get
his
chance
at
having
a
constitutionally
fair
trial,
and
consistently
this
court
has
said
that
the
habeas
is
to
protect
people
like
mr.
o'neal,
people
whose
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated,
and
ensure
the
accuracy
and
determination
of
the
guilty
and
innocent
in
the
state
proceedings.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
once
we
have
shown
a
constitutional
violation,
we
have
overcome
a
presumption.
the
presumption
is
that
if
we
go
into
federal
habeas
corpus
and
we
do
not
prove
a
constitutional
violation,
we
lose,
and
at
that
point,
this
process
stops.
the
state
is
presumed
to
have
obtained
a
constitutionally
valid
judgment.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it's
more
of
an
affirmative
defense
on
the
state
to
avoid
the
actions
of
the...
for
the
prior
conduct.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
this
court
has
already
determined
the
quantum
of
proof
under
kotteakos,
by--
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
--we
are
not
here
to
attack
that
position.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
state's
position
of
placing
the
burden
on
the
petitioner
attacks
that
petition--
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
--and
is
inconsistent
with
the
kotteakos
standard
and
the
lower
case
standards,
and
that
the
court
has
already
accommodated
the
interests
of
the
state
by
reducing
the
standard
for
collateral
review,
and
that
is
not
being
challenged
by
mr.
o'neal.
what
mr.
o'neal
is
saying
at
this
point
is,
he's
proven
his
constitutional
violation.
the
state
should
then
have
to
prove
that
they
did
not
deprive
him
of
his
liberty
in
an
unconstitutional
manner
by
demonstrating
it
had
no
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
case,
and
we
believe
that
that
meets
the
kotteakos
standard.
when
there's
an
allocation
of
the
burden
upon
the
petitioner,
it
demonstrate...
it
places
upon
the
petitioner
the
risk
that
the
lower
court
will
make
an
error
in
that
judgment
on
whether
or
not
he's
met
his
burden.
traditionally,
that
has
been
placed
with
the
state
in
the...
for
the
protection
of
liberty.
however,
with
placing
the
burden
upon
the
petitioner,
we
also
run
the
risk
that
in
those
close
cases
in
which
there...
you
cannot
say
that
there
has
been
obtaining
of
a
verdict
in
an
unconstitutional
manner,
that
the
petitioner
would
not
obtain
relief
with
the
burden
being
placed
on
him.
if
the
burden
is
placed
on
the
state,
then
those
petitioners
will
obtain
relief
under
the
kotteakos
standard,
and
that
will
meet
all
the
interests
of
the
state
and
meet
the
interests
of
the
petitioner.

said,

kind
of
serious
constitutional
defect
that
gives
rise
to

substantial
risk
that

innocent
person

is
fully
sufficient
to
meet
that
standard.
"
the
court
had
before
it
in
the
brecht
case
whether
or
not
to
adopt
the
kotteakos
standard,
the
chapman
standard,
or
some
other
standard,
and
decided
to
go
with
the
kotteakos
standard.
at
that
point,
the
kotteakos
standard
was
known
to
include
the
burden
of
proof
being
placed
upon
the
state.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
but
this
court
said
it
wanted
the
lower
courts
to
use
the
case
law
in
kotteakos
as
guidance
to
determining
habeas
cases.
that
case
law
is
only
available
if
the
court
adopts
the
same
standard,
and
that's
what
this
court
was
saying.
it
did
not
say
that
the
kotteakos
standard
is
okay,
but
place
the
burden
upon
the
state.
it
needed
to
do
that.
mr.

wetterer,

yes,
it
was,
your
honor.

wetterer,

the
determination
of
harmless
error.
the
determination
of
harmless
error--
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
--justice
stevens
in
his
concurrence
opinion
addressed
the
issue
directly.
it
was
not
addressed
directly
by
the
other
opinions.
however,
in
the
majority
opinion,
when
the
court
indicated
that
the
kotteakos
case
law
was
to
be
applied
and
then
issued
the
olano
decision,
indicating
in
olano
the...
affirming
that
the
state
would
bear
the
burden
under
kotteakos,
the
court
should
have
given
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
that
the
burden
was
placed
upon
the
state
under
the
kotteakos-brecht
standard.
in
this
case,
mr.
o'neal
was
deprived
of
his
liberty
as
a
result
of
a
defective
jury
instruction
that
transferred
intent
from
the
codef...
from
codefendants
to
him
in
such
a
manner
that
the
state
did
not
have
to
prove
intent
upon
him
to
find
him
guilty.
in
fact,
as
the
magistrate
indicated
in
his
reports,
the
jury
could
have
believed
mr.
o'neal's
story
when
he
testified,
and
the
evidence
that
supported
him,
finding
him
to
be
factually
innocent,
but
have
to
convict
him
under
this
theory,
because
he
did
innocent
acts
which
aided
a
conspiracy,
and
therefore
this
jury
instruction
did
have
a
substantial
and
egregious
effect
upon
the
outcome
of
the
case
and
the
lower
court
should
have
granted
relief
in
this
case.
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
found
by
the
sixth
circuit.
the
court...
the
sixth
circuit
traditionally,
when
it's
reviewing
the
record
and
determines
there's
no
constitutional
violations,
gives
short
shrift
and
says,
there's
no
constitutional
violation
here,
and
then
dismisses
the
case
in
its
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
particular
case
in
the
last
two
pages
of
the
opinion
found
that
some
of
the
errors
the
petitioner
raised
did
not
raise
to
a
constitutional
level,
and
therefore
they
indicated
they
weren't
going
to
even
analyze
them.
under
the
boyde
standard
adopted
by
this
court
for
determination
of
a
jury
instruction,
the
court
does
not
look
only
at
the
jury
instruction,
but
has
to
look
at
how
the
jury
instruction
is
used
by
the
court,
by
the
parties
in
this
particular
case,
and
boyde,
even
though
in
this
case
the
jury
instruction
alone
was
not
a
violation,
it
became
a
constitutional
violation
when
it
was
used
by
the
court
in
this
manner,
and
in
response
to
the
prosecutor's
comments.
in
the
record
below,
there
will
be
a
demonstration
that
there
was
three
instances
in
the
closing
argument
of
the
prosecutor
in
which
he
made
references
to
transferred
intent
arguments
to
the
jury,
and
that
the
court,
in
its
original
charge,
made
at
least
six
references
to
the
ability
to
transfer
intent,
and
at
least
three
references
in
a
supplemental
charge
which
was
given
after
the
jury
was
given...
asked
a
question
about
reasonable
doubt.
in
mr.
o'neal's
case,
the
prosecution
made
a
very
gruesome
argument
to
the
jury,
and
asked
them
to
go
back
in
the
room,
put
the
clothes
on,
walk
around
and
think
about
what
it
would
be
like
to
hit
at
someone
in
the
head
with
a
crowbar,
and
that
they
should
find
these
parties
guilty.
if
the
jury
really
believed
at
that
point
the
best
evidence
of
guilt,
toney's,
then
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
come
back
and
ask
for
any
further
instructions,
because
under
the
state's
theory,
the
best
theory
the
state
had
was
that
mr.
o'neal
killed
mr.
podborny
with
the
help
of
his
assistant,
and
that
mrs.
podborny
had
paid
for
that
to
be
done,
and
that
there
were
other
people
that
verified
mrs.
o'neal's...
mrs.
podborny's
story,
but
there
was
no
one
to
tie...
o'neal's
issue
was
very
substantially
in
doubt.
but
the
jury
came
back,
and
they
asked
for
more
instructions,
and
at
that
point
they
got
this
defective
jury
instruction
again
which
basically,
if
the
jury
found
that
mr.
o'neal
was
factually
innocent,
they
had
to
find
him
guilty
based
on
the
intent
of
others
that
had
been
convicted
in
an
earlier
proceeding.
this
case,
if
the
burden
is
placed
upon
the
state,
would
not
affect
that
many
cases.
it
would
only
affect
the
cases
in
an
equipoise,
and
those
are
the
cases
that
this
court
has
traditionally
said
are
entitled
to
relief.
the
person
that
has
been
deprived
of
his
liberty
has
that
liberty
taken
away
in
a
trial,
and
we're
saying
that
as
a
result
of
that
constitutional
violation
that
has
occurred,
and
that
there's
grave
doubts
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
be
in
prison
at
all,
or
he
should
have
obtained
a
new
trial.
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice,
the
society
has
always
borne
that
risk,
and
in
these
cases,
society
should
still
remain
to
bear
that
risk.
when
we're
dealing
with
the
administration
of
justice,
sometimes
justice
should
go
before
the
easy
administration
of
justice,
and
in
this
case,
it
goes
hand-in-hand,
because
if
the
court
were
to
place
the
burden
upon
this
petitioner
and
other
petitioners,
it
would
extremely
complicate
the
process
and
would
make
it
a
burden
upon
the
district
courts
at
all
levels
to
determine
what
constitutes
the
constitution.
every
individual
should
know
what
constitutes
a
constitutional
violation,
whether
on
direct
review
or
collateral
review.
this
court--
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
--because
every
petitioner
after
this
case
would
have
to
plead
fact
specifics
in
the
record
to
demonstrate
why
this
error
had
an
impact,
how
it
was
substantially
egregious,
besides
alleging
his
constitutional
violation.
at
that
point,
the
court
would
then
have
to
decide
whether
he
sufficiently
raised
facts
to
warrant
the
issue
of
a
show-cause
order.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
when
the...
under
the...
or
under
current
practice
in
federal
courts,
petitioner
files
a
petition
which
just
states
the
reasons
for
a
constitutional
violation.
at
that
point,
the
court
has
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
violation.
if
there
is,
he
grants
a
show
cause
order,
and
the
process
starts.
if
he's--
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
--unless
it
was
an
issue
in
which
it
was
overwhelmingly
a
stupid
issue
raised
by
the
petitioner
and
a
claim
that
wouldn't
affect
the
case,
then
the
courts
would
not
issue
a
show
cause
order.
but
once
a
show
cause
order
is
issued,
then
they
have
to
file
a
return
of
writ,
and
then
the
court
looks
at
the
record,
and
at
that
point,
even
before
determining
the
merits
of
the
claim,
if
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
whole
record,
as
justice
stevens
indicates,
that's
going
to
complicate
the
process
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
a
constitutional
error.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
your
honor,
it
should,
and
that's
what
this
court
said
under
lockhart
v.
fretwell,
that
those
are
two
separate
issues,
constitutional
claim,
and
whether
or
not
there's--
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
--it
would
become
part
and
parcel
of
the
constitutional
claim.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
it's
part
of
the
determination
of
whether
to
grant
relief,
but
if
the
court
does
not
find
a
constitutional
violation,
regardless
of
reviewing
the
record,
if
he
looks
at
the
violation
and
says,
this
does
not
violate
the
constitution,
then
he
doesn't
have
to
get
to
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
we
would
respectfully
disagree
on
that
point,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
the
court
can
focus
on
just
whether
or
not
a
constitutional
claim
has
arisen
at
that
point,
and
that
makes
it
a
lot
simpler
process.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
the
work
of
the
courts
will
be...
will
have
to
deal
with
harmless
error
at
all
levels,
and
the
work
of
the
lower
courts
would
be--
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
--that's
what
we
would
like
this
court
to
say.
by
placing
the
burden
on
the
state
if
the
court
finds
there's
no
constitutional
violation,
they
don't
have
to
address
that
issue
at
all.
only
at
the
finding
of
a
constitutional
violation
would
they
have
to.
under
mccleskey
and
stone,
the
court
has
said
the
state
has
no
final
interest
in
a
case
in
which
there's
been
a
constitutional
violation,
and
therefore
this
burden
is
a
necessary
burden
to
be
placed
upon
the
state.
in
those
closed
cases
in
which
there
are
grave
doubts,
the
court
is
only
looking
at
this
particular
constitutional
violation.
it
may
have
other
constitutional
violations
that
it
can't
look
at,
and
we're
saying
in
those
cases
in
which
there's
a
grave
doubt,
the
petitioner
should
be
granted
a
new
trial.
in
this
particular
case,
the
prosecutor
has
informed
me
he's
going
to
try
mr.
o'neal
again,
and
mr.
o'neal
wants
to
be
tried
again.
he
wants
to
clear
his
name,
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that
habeas
corpus
does.
it
allows
the
petitioner,
if
he's
able
to
pursue
his
claim,
to
get
a
new
trial
if
the
state
grants
him
that
new
trial.
it's
up
to
the
state
at
that
point,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
that's
what
he's
told
me.
he
wants
to
have
his
name
cleared
by
a
trial.
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
we
were
granted...
your
honor,
i
was
granted
a
writ
by
the
district
court.
i
asked
my
client
at
that
point
what
he
wanted
to
do.
he
wanted
a
new
trial.
he
did
not
want
to
offer
any
deal
to
the
state.
the
state
in
this
case
has
run
three
trials.
there
are
three
transcripts
out
there
dealing
with
all
the
witnesses.
in
the
third
trial
that
arose
2
years
after
the
original
one,
there
was
a
conviction,
too,
on
other
charges,
but
the
state
has
not
indicated
they're
unable
to
try
this
man
again.
in
fact,
they
have
the
exhibits,
except
for
the
exhibits
that
were
ruled
unconstitutional
by
the
district
court.
some
of
those
have
been
lost,
but
all
the
other...
the
main
witnesses
in
this
case
are
still
available
for
trial,
and
the
state
has
indicated--
mr.
thomas
r.
wetterer,
jr.
--basically,
your
honor,
because
the
petitioner
always
shows
a
nexus
by
his
constitutional
claim
with
the
case
in
order
to
grant
the
show
cause
order.
but
now,
what
the
court
are
saying
is,
well,
how
do
i
know
there
wasn't
10
other
witnesses
that
came
in,
or
how
do
i
know
this
wasn't
in
the
record,
and
petitioner
has
to
plead
the
negative.
he
has
to
demonstrate
that
somehow
this
had
some
overwhelming
effect,
so
he
has
to
explain
what
the
state's
arguments
would
be,
and
that's
a
burden
that
the
petitioner
shouldn't
have
to
bear.
and
in
this
particular
case,
we're
talking
about
a
small
class
of
individuals,
if
the
court
decides
the
burden
remains
on
the
state,
and
those
individuals
traditionally
have
been
granted
relief
by
this
court,
because
this
court
has
determined
that
the
final...
that
there
is
a
premium
to
be
paid
by
the
state
when
there's
been
no
fair
trial
and
the
finality
and
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
undermined
by
a
constitutional
violation
that's
been
proven,
and
in
mr.
o'neal's
case,
he
should
have
that
opportunity
for
a
new
trial.
thank
you,
your
honor.
