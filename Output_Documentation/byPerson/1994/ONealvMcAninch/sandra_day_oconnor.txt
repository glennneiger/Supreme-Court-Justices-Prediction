mr.
wetterer,
i
guess
habeas
corpus
is
a
civil
action,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
we
had
indicated
that
it
is
civil,
and
certainly
the
longstanding
rule
is
that
the
plaintiff
in
a
civil
case
has
the
burden
of
proof
of
all
elements.
justice

but
presumably
the
prisoner
in
a
habeas
action
still
has
to
prove
that
the
prisoner
is
being
held
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cordray,
you
don't
have
much
time
left,
and
i
wanted
to
ask
a
different
sort
of
question.
as
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
sixth
circuit,
do
you
think
the
sixth
circuit
found
there
was
a
constitutional
error
in
the
instruction?
