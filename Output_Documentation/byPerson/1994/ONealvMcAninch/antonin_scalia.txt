does
this
apply
even
to
what
we
have
called
in
some
of
our
cases
structural
error?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
your
answer
to
that
was
that
in
direct
review
the
question
is
whether
the
conviction
was
proper,
whereas
on
collateral
review
the
question
is
whether
the
individual
is
being
held
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution,
and
if
the
latter
is
true,
only
where
he
makes
a
showing
not
only
that
there
was
a
mistake
in
the
conviction,
but
also
when
he
makes
a
showing
that
that
mistake
led
to
his
incarceration.
it's
really
a
different
question
on
direct
review,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
habeas
statute
that
makes
the
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
could
really
run
the
same
argument
on
direct
appeal,
too,
i
suppose.
you
could
say
that
it's
the
burden
of
the
convicted
defendant
to
show
that
the
conviction
was
a
result
of
the
error
of
law,
not
merely
that
there
was
an
error,
but
that
the
conviction
was
improper,
and
the
conviction,
you
could
say,
was
not
improper
unless
you
show
that
the
error
of
law
produced
the
conviction,
and
yet
we
don't
say
that.
i
mean,
you
could
run
the
same
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
you--
