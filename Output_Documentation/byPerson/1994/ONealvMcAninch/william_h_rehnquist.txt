chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-7407,
robert
o'neal
v.
fred
mcaninch,
warden.
mr.
wetterer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
chapman,
mr.
wetterer,
was
on
direct
appeal.
why
shouldn't
the
result
be
different
on
habeas?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
shouldn't
it
also
accommodate
those
interests
by
saying
that
the
burden
is
on
the
petitioner
rather
than
on
the
state
as
to,
when
the
thing
is
equally
divided,
i
guess?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
a
lot
of
cases
will
be
affected
by
how
we
decide
this
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
use
the
term,
grave
doubt,
though,
you're
not
talking
about
the
constitutional
violation,
but
grave
doubt
as
to
whether
there
was
any
prejudice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
habeas
petitioner
has
to
satisfy
the
court
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
certainly
accords
with
the
normal
civil
presumption,
that
he's
the
plaintiff,
and
he's
got
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
a
1983
action?
all
the
time
you
have
plaintiffs
trying
to
prove
that
the
state
has
violated
their
constitutional
rights,
and
yet
the
burden
of
proof
remains
on
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
in
most,
in
a
civil
case,
once
it's
over,
it's
over.
federal
habeas
gives
people
in
your
client's
position
really
a
second
bite
of
the
apple.
they've
already
been
found
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
now
they're
getting
a
second
try,
so
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
say
the
burden
of
proof
should
be
on
them
right
across
the
board?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
in
the
appendix,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
the
kotteakos
standard
also
applied
at
that
time
just
on
direct
appeal,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
question
really
wasn't
before
us
in
kotteakos,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
burden
of
proof?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
test
for
harmless
error
was
certainly
before
us,
but
nobody
directly
presented
the
question
of
who
should
have
the...
run
the
risk
of...
bear
the
burden
of
persuasion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wetterer.
mr.
cordray,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cordray,
let
me
ask
you
the
same
question
that
i
asked
petitioner's
counsel.
the
court
has
found
a
constitutional
violation.
now
it
must
apply
the
kotteakos
standard,
and
i
can't
rephrase
it
exactly,
but
by
hypothesis,
the
only
cases
in
which
the
outcome
on
this
particular
case
is
going
to
make
any
difference
is
where
the
court
is
going
to
say,
yes,
there's
been
a
constitutional
violation,
and
i
just
can't
say
whether
there's
a
grave
likelihood
that
it
substantially
affected
his
rights.
how
often
does
that
come
up,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
assume--
--thank
you,
mr.
cordray.
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
wetterer,
you
have
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
ruling
in
favor
of
the
state
here
complicate
the
task
of
the
district
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
the
government
going
to
be
doing
that
on
the
other
side
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
placed
otherwise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
some...
before
brecht,
there
was
some
form
of
harmless
error
applied
in
habeas
corpus,
but
you
say...
but
that
was
never
taken
into
consideration
in
the
drafting
of
the
petition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
wouldn't
the
court
first
look
at
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claim,
particularly
if
it's
as
difficult
as
you
say
to
look
into
the
harmless
error
aspect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
you're
trying
to
show
that
the
district
court's
task
will
be
tremendously
complicated
if
we
don't
rule
in
your
favor,
and
you're
saying,
because
they're
going
to
have
to
immediately
look
to
see
whether
there
was
any
effect
of
the
alleged
constitutional
error.
you're
suggesting
they
would
decide
the
harmless
error
question
before
the
constitutional
question.
i
just
don't
see
why.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
still...
however
we
decide
this,
it's
part
and
parcel
of
the
constitutional
question.
whether
the
burden
of
proving
the
kotteakos
standard
was
met
is
on
your
client
or
on
the
state,
it's
still
part
of
the
constitutional
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
can
do
that
under,
however
we
rule
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me,
the
judge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
your
client
affirmatively
wants
to
be
tried
again
as
opposed
to
having
the
charges
against
him
simply
dismissed
for
failure
to
produce
witnesses?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wetterer.
the
case
is
submitted.
