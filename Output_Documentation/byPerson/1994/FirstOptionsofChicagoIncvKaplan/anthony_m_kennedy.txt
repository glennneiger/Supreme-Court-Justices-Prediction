do
you
think
our
law
is
or
should
be
that
there
is
a
difference
when
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
person
is
subject
to
the
arbitration
as
opposed
to
the
case
where
the
question
is
whether
the
subject
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
within
the
arbitration?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
in
each
case
there
has
to
be
a
clear
and
unmistakable
reference
to
the
arbitrator?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
there's
no
difference
in
the
two
instances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
aren't
some
parties'
issues
close?
that
is
to
say,
agents,
principals,
joint
ventures--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
so
that
there
can
be
some
questions
of...
what
we'll
call
personal
jurisdiction
that
are
subject
to
a
less
deferential
rule.
there
does
not
need
to
be
a
clear
and
unmistakable
delegation?
