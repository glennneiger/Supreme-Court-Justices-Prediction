justice

what
do
you
have
here...
what
is
the
closest
thing
to
a
formal
stipulation
to
have
the
arbitrator
decide
that
you
have
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
did
it
say
that
moreover,
we
will
be
content
with
whatever
determination
the
arbitrator
makes?
it
seems
to
me
what
your
case
comes
down
to
is
that
whenever
you
choose
to
litigate
jurisdiction
before
the
arbitrator,
you
have
automatically
conceded
that
whatever
the
arbitrator
says
goes,
and
i
don't
see
that
that
follows.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
reminds
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
the
old-fashioned
rule,
which
we've
left
behind
a
long
time
ago
in
all
jurisdictions
as
far
as
i
know,
that
you
could
not
challenge
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court,
that
if
you
appeared
to
argue
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction,
you
automatically
submit
yourself
to
the
court's
jurisdiction.
that
rule's
been,
you
know,
superseded
with
regard
to
law
courts
for
a
long
time.
i
don't
know
why
we
should
bring
it
back
in
with
regard
to
arbitrators.
you
could
even...
you
could
make
a
special
appearance,
even
at
common
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
but
it's
a
question
of
what
is
the
reasonable
implication
of
the
mere
fact
that
the
party
appears
to
argue
the
point.
if
what's
at
issue
is
whether
a
particular
action
came
within
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
or
not,
arguing
that
point
before
the
arbitrator
is
arguably
an
implicit
submission
of
the
point
to
the
arbitrator,
but
where
what
your
contention
is
quite
simply,
mr.
arbitrator,
you
have
no
jurisdiction
over
me
at
all,
i
don't
even
want
to
be
before
you,
arguing
that
before
the
arbitrator
is
not
implicitly,
is
in
no
way
implicitly
saying,
and
moreover,
even
though
you
have
no
right
over
me,
whatever
you
decide
is
okay
with
me.
that
is
certainly
not
reasonable
a
implication
to
take
from
the
mere
appearance
in
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
why
is
that?
somebody
speaking
of...
somebody
shows
up
at
my
house
with
a
bulldozer
and
says,
i
own
this
property.
i'm
going
to
raze
this
house
and
build
a
different
one
here,
and
i
say,
no,
wait
a
minute,
i
don't
think
you
own
this
house.
let's
discuss
that.
and
i
argue
with
him
about
whether
he
in
fact
owns
the
house.
i
am
unable
to
persuade
him.
he
says,
no,
i've
listened
to
you,
i
conclude
you
don't
own
the
house.
he
therefore...
he
then
proceeds
to
bulldoze
it
down.
would
you
come
into
court
and
say,
well,
you
know,
scalia,
you
shouldn't
have
argued
with
him
about
it?
[laughter]
once
you
argued
with
him
about
it,
you
subjected
yourself
to
his
decision,
whatever
it
was.
he
decided
you
didn't
own
it.
and
that's
what's
going
on
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
fellow
comes
to
the
arbitrator
and
he
says,
i'm
about
to
arbitrate
this
case.
but
wait
a
minute.
don't
arbitrate
this
case.
you
have
no
business
arbitrating
it.
he
says,
i'm
sorry.
you
argued
it.
you
lost.
you
had
your
fair
day
in
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
just
not
fair,
it
really
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
he
certainly
would
have
spoken
to
the
bulldozer
first,
then
he'd
run
off
to
court,
and
so
also
here.
he'd
speak
to
the
arbitrator
first.
he'd...
oh,
look,
i
really
think
you
don't
belong
in
this
case,
and
then
he'd
try
to
persuade
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
tend
to
regard
the
subject
matter
cases
as
being
cases
in
which...
it's
whether
this
closely
related
issue
is
within
the
arbitration,
but...
and
that's
why
i
think
you're
getting
the
response
you
do,
but
one
can
conceive
of
a
subject
matter
case,
for
example,
in
which
i've
agreed
to
have
my
relations
with
my
broker
determined
by
stock
exchange
arbitration,
and
the
stock
exchange
arbitrator
wants
to
decide
a
tort
action
between
me
and
somebody
who's
hit
me
with
his
car.
it
may
be
a
subject
matter
dispute
technically,
but
i'd
certainly
apply
the
same
kind
of
notion
that
it's
not
implicitly
given
to
the
arbitrator.
justice
antonin
scalia
since
they're
close,
it's
easy
to
think
that
implicitly
that
call
was
left
to
the
arbitrator.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
happened
at
this
prehearing
conference
where
they
assertedly
withdrew
their
objection?
what
specifically
happened?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
issue
is
whether
that
means
we
withdrew
it
from
consideration
at
the
conference,
or
whether
it
means,
we
withdrew
it
from
consideration
at
the
conference,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
nice
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
wrote
that,
i
wonder?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
10(a)(4)
does
not
apply
to
the
arbitrators
exceeding
their
jurisdiction
in
the
context
where
the
parties
have
submitted
jurisdiction
to
the
arbitrator?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
not
reviewed
de--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
wait.
i'm
not
talking
about
whether
it's
in
excess
of
his
powers.
i'm
talking
about
whether
it
should
be
reviewed
de
novo
or
not.
you
would
not
review
it
de
novo.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
can
you
argue
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
requires
de
novo
review
of
all
jurisdictional
matters?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
