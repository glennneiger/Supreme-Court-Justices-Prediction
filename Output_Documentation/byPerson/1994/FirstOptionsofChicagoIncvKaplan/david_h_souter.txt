justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
they
forego
that
determination
on
a
de
novo
standard
of
review.
they
give
up
something.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
to
that
extent--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
analogue
seems
to
me,
just
as
justice
scalia
said,
it's
like
the
analogue
of
the
person
who
files
a
special
appearance
and
then
argues
jurisdiction.
in
that
case,
in
the
old...
under
the
old
rule
they
lost
completely.
under
this
rule,
they
lose
the
de
novo
judicial
determination.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what's
the
difference
also,
then,
between
that
situation
and
the
situation
which
i
thought
your
brief
was
referring
to
in
which
there
is
simply
a
straight
refusal
to
arbitrate?
i
am
going
to
stay
home.
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
in
the
absence
of
a
default
rule,
you
can
perfectly
well
do
that,
and
that
simply
puts
the
burden
on
the
other
side
to
haul
you
into
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
haven't
changed--
justice
david
h.
souter
--a
moment
ago,
i
thought
you
might
be
changing
your
position
on
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
i
thought
you
said
that
if
they
did
not
want
to
suffer
the
effects
of
implicit
agreement
by
submission,
they
would
have
to,
they
the
objecting
party
would
have
to
go
into
court,
and
you're
not
saying
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
you
are
making
a
difference
between
a
personal
jurisdiction
question
and
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
was
that
that
might
be
subject
to
different
treatment.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean,
the
legal
standard
is
the
same,
but
in
effect
they're
usually
going
to
apply
it
differently
to
a
subject
matter
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
isn't
it
because
there's
a
different
standard?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
just
to
go
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy,
the
reason
you
answered
him
as
you
did,
then,
is
that
you
in
effect
were
assuming
most
subject
matter
questions
are
close.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
all
you
meant
by
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
you
fall
back
to
this
as
just
kind
of
a
secondary
position.
the
argument
would
go
something
like
this.
whenever
you
submit
issues
to
arbitration,
in
effect
you're
consenting
to
a
kind
of
rough-and-ready
disposition
of
whatever
your
claims
or
disputes
may
be,
and
therefore
there's
no
reason
to
sort
of
draw
fine
lines
as
to
what
you
were
rough
and
ready
about.
but
on
the
question
of
whether
you
decide
or
agree
or
not
to
appear
before
an
arbitrator
in
the
first
place,
that
in
fact
is
an
agreement
sort
of
to
be
distinguished,
because
if
you
didn't
agree
to
that,
then
nobody
can
claim
that,
in
effect,
you
asked
for
a
rough-and-ready
procedure
and
that's
what
you
got,
so
why
don't
you
say
that
there
is,
in
fact,
a
superior
value
to
be
served
by
making
this
distinction
between
subject
and
person,
and
the
person
agreement
at
least
must
be
clear
and
unmistakable,
regardless
of
what
the
subject
agreement
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
simply
by
varying
the
standard,
we'd
get
to
the
same
point
that
we
would
get
to
on
your
analysis
if
we
didn't
vary
the
standard,
because
the
one
question
is
not
going
to
be
close,
and
the
other
question
is
going
to
be
close,
but
justice
kennedy
said
the
subject...
the
personal
jurisdiction
questions
can
be
close
when
you
get
into
agency
and
so
on.
