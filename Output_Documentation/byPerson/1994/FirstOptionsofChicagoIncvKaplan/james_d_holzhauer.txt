mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
primary
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
courts
should
give
normal
deference
to
an
arbitration
decision
on
the
issue
of
arbitrability
when
the
objecting
party
asks
the
arbitrators
to
decide
that
issue.
first
options
filed
claims
against
mk
investments,
its
president
and
sole
shareholder,
manuel
kaplan,
and
his
wife,
carol
kaplan.
there
was
no
dispute
as
to
the
arbitrability
of
the
claims
against
mk
investments,
but
the
kaplans
objected
to
the
arbitrability
of
the
claims
against
them
individually.
they
withdrew
those
objections
at
a
prehearing
conference,
but
2
years
later,
they
filed
a
motion
stating
that
the
arbitrators
had
not
yet
ruled
on
their
objections,
and
asking
the
panel
for
a
ruling.
their
motion
included
a
detailed
memorandum
of
law
addressing
all
of
the
bases
for
arbitrability
asserted
by
first
options.
the
arbitration
panel
gave
the
issue
full
consideration,
and
ruled
that
the
claims
against
the
kaplans
individually
were
arbitrable.
respondents'
arguments
cannot
diminish
the
fact
that
they
asked
for
and
received
the
arbitrator's
ruling
on
the
arbitrability
issue,
so
the
question
is
whether
such
a
ruling,
like
rulings
on
other
issues
submitted
to
arbitration,
is
entitled
to
deference,
or
must
be
reviewed
by
courts
de
novo.
although
parties
are
clearly
entitled
to
an
initial
judicial
determination
of
arbitrability,
this
court's
decisions
in
at&t
technologies
and
warrior
&
gulf
make
it
equally
clear
that
the
parties
can
submit
the
arbitrability
issue
to
the
arbitrators
instead.
now,
respondents
agree
that
if
the
parties
formally
agree
to
submit
the
arbitrability
issue
to
the
arbitrators
for
a
conclusive
determination,
deferential
review
may
well
be
appropriate,
but
they
apparently
believe
that
deference
is
due
only
if
the
parties
enter
into
a
formal
written
agreement
or
stipulation
to
have
the
arbitrators
finally
decide
that
issue.
there
is
no
principal
distinction--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--we
have
a
motion
that
they
filed
with
an
accompanying
memorandum
of
law
saying,
addressing
the
issue
of
jurisdiction,
and
asking
the
arbitrators
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
had
jurisdiction.
of
course,
they
asked
the
arbitrators
to
determine
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
we
don't
say
that
whatever
the
arbitrators
say
goes.
we're
saying
that
whatever
the
arbitrator
says
is
in
entitled
to
the
usual
form
of
deference.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
the
determination
of
whether
they've
agreed
to
submit
it
to
arbitration?
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
think
that
that
is
obviously
entitled
to...
that
should
be
reviewed
by
the
court.
in
at&t
technologies
in
particular,
the
question
was
whether
the
parties...
the
issue
that
was
raised
by
the
dictum
in
that
case
was
whether
the
parties
had
clearly
and
unmistakable
agreed
to
submit
the
arbitrability
issue
to
the
arbitrators,
but
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
in
that
case
the
issue
came
up
in
the
first
instance
in
the
courts.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
yes,
it
is.
yes,
it
is,
but--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--the
law
in
the
third
circuit
was
very
confused
before
this
case,
and
continues
to
be
confused.
there
have
been
a
number
of
courts
that
have
said
that
in
all
situations
there
will
be
judicial
review
on
a
de
novo
basis
of
arbitrability
determinations,
but
the
third
circuit
wasn't
one
of
those
courts.
in
at
least
four
cases
that
i
know
of,
the
united
industrial
workers
case,
the
yorkaire
case,
which
was
a
district
court
decision
affirmed
by
the
third
circuit,
pennsylvania
power,
and
a
case
called
gk
management,
the
third
circuit
took
our
position
and
said
that
when
the
arbitrators
argue
the
issue
of
arbitrability,
when
the
parties
argue
the
issue
of
arbitrability
to
the
arbitrators,
the
arbitrators'
determination
is
entitled
to
deference,
so
the
issue
is
quite
up
in
the
air
in
the
third
circuit.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
sure.
that's
the
question
that
is
posed
most
directly
by
the
ninth
circuit's
george
day
decision.
there--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--my
position
would
be
that
that
would
not
be
sufficient.
now,
that's
not
in
this
case.
the
parties
didn't
do
anything
like
that
here,
object
and
say,
we'll
go
on
but
we
don't
want
you
to
reach
that
issue.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
would
force
them
to
litigate
the
issue
in
one
forum
or
another.
clearly
they
have
the
right
to
litigate
that
or
to
obtain
initial--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--if
they
wanted
district
court
review
on
a
de
novo
basis,
yes,
i
would
say
they
would
have
to
go
to
district
court
at
the
outset,
but
as
the
slew
of
cases
that
this
court
sees
and
that
we
all
see
going
to
arbitration
demonstrates,
parties
submit
very
difficult
and
complex
issues
to
arbitration
all
the
time.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
don't
think
that's
correct
at
all.
in
fact,
in
the
sixth,
eighth,
and
ninth
circuits,
we've
had
the
rule
for
some
time
that
arbitrability
determinations
of
arbitration
will
be
entitled
to
deferential
review,
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
evidence
that
respondents
have
cited
or
that
i've
been
able
to
find
that
in
those
circuits
we
have
a
difficulty
with
arbitration--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--right
to
court.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
to
begin
with,
we're
not
arguing
at
all
that
the
parties
waive
or
forego
their
right
to
determination
of
arbitrability
when
they
present
that
issue
to
the
arbitrator.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
they
give
up
the
right
to
have
a
judicial
determination
de
novo,
but
in
return,
they
achieve--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--the
benefits
of
arbitration.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
there
are
a
lot
of
differences
between
court
jurisdiction
and
arbitral
jurisdiction.
arbitral
jurisdiction
is
a
product
of
the
consent
of
the
parties.
it's
a
contractual
matter.
the--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
there
are
many
situations
in
which
arbitrability,
arbitration
is
not
set
by
a
particular
preexisting
contract
but
by
the
agreement
of
the
parties.
they
have
a
dispute,
and
they
decide
that
they're
going,
rather
than
go
through
the
more
lengthy
and
perhaps
more
expensive
process
in
the
federal
courts
or
the
state
courts,
they're
going
to
submit
that
dispute
to
arbitration.
in
this
case,
the
parties
had
a
dispute
as
to
lots
of
issues,
and
one
of
the
issues
they
had
a
dispute
as
to
was
arbitrability,
and
in
this
case
the
party
that
objected
to
arbitrability,
the
two
parties
that
objected
to
arbitrability,
submitted
that
issue
to
the
arbitrator.
now,
clearly--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--yes,
as
far
as
whether
the
parties
have
the
authority
or
the
right
to
submit
that
to
arbitration
if
they
want
to.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
whether
they
had
agreed
to
arbitrate
at
all?
no,
i
don't
think...
i
misunderstood
that
question,
and
no,
i
don't
think
they
have
a
right
to
de
novo
review
of
whether
they
agreed
to
arbitrate
at
all
if
they
submit
that
question
to
the
arbitrators.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
if
you're
not
satisfied
with
having
the
arbitrators
determine
arbitrability,
the
alternative
is
to
go
into
court.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
both.
whether
a
dispute
is
arbitrable--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--i
think
that
we
can
make
those
issues
quite
separate,
but
i
believe
the
result
is
the
same
under
both
situations.
i
believe
that
the
question
is
whether
somebody
had
agreed
to
arbitrate
a
dispute,
that
that
party
has...
is
perfectly
entitled
to
submit
that
issue
to
the
arbitrators,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
respondents
disagree
with
that,
that
the
parties
can
submit
the
question
of
arbitral
jurisdiction
over
them
to
the
arbitrators.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
disagree
with
that.
i
think
that
the
party
has
the
right
to
submit
that
issue,
along
with
the
subject
matter
issue,
to
the
arbitrators,
and
that
by
going
to
the
arbitrators
and
saying,
okay,
we
have
this
objection
to
arbitrability,
these
are
the
four
issues
that
we
claim,
reasons
why
we
claim
this
is
not
arbitrable,
we're
going
to
go
ahead
and
argue
those
to
you
and
submit
those
to
you
along
with
our
counterclaim
and
along
with
our
defense
to
the
rest
of
this
case.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
the
george
day
decision,
and
i
agree
with
respondent's
point
on
that.
respondents
thought
that
that
would
be
a
very
inefficient
and
wasteful
way,
that
it
would
be
better
off
having
the
parties
argue
the
issue
of
arbitrability
either
to
the
court
or
to
the
arbitrators
in
the
first
instance.
i
also
think
that
that
kind
of
scheme
could
result
in
an
inappropriate
form
of
gamesmanship.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
my...
that
again,
you
know,
it's
not
this
case,
but
my
view
is
that
would
be
a
waiver
of
the
argument,
and
i
think
there's
a
big
difference
between
waiver
and
deference
in
this
case.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
absolutely.
under
the
federal
arbitration
act,
under
those
circumstances,
the
parties
seeking
arbitration
would
be
required
to
file
a
motion
to
compel
to
get
that--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--before
them.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
no.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
no,
i'm
not.
as
i
understood
the
question,
it
was
whether...
it
was
basically
the
george
day
question,
whether
a
party
can
say,
i
object
to
arbitrability.
i
don't
want
to
even
waive
that
question
here
because
i'm
afraid
of
waiving
it.
i'll
go
ahead
with
the
rest
of
the
case,
but
i
want
the
courts
to
determine
arbitrability
de
novo.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
think
that
should
be
a
waiver.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
mm-hmm.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
right.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
right.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
right.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
the
reason
we
need
a
special
rule
in
this
situation
is
because
we
have
a
federal
arbitration
act
and
a
well
announced
federal
policy
regarding
arbitration
that
encourages
arbitration
and
enforces
agreements
to
arbitrate
and
gives
strong
deference
to
arbitral
decisions,
and
the
question,
i
think,
should
be
is,
not
why
should
this
contract
question
be
treated
any
differently
than
any
other
contract
question,
but
why
should
this
contract
question
decided
by
an
arbitrator
be
treated
differently
than
any
other
contract
question--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--by
an
arbitrator?
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
right.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
if
what
you're
saying
is,
is
basically
that
the
courts
should
decide
this
issue
with
the
same
kinds
of
standards
that
they
apply--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--to
other
deferen...
other
arbitration
decisions--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--on
contract
matters.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
there
also
is
a
question
in
this
case,
for
example,
as
to
whether
mr.
kaplan
had
agreed
to
pay
over
certain
money,
and
as
to
whether
first
options
had
agreed,
or
first
options
had
increased
mr.
kaplan's
losses
and
therefore
was
responsible
for
some
of
those
debts,
and
those
questions
were
in
large
part
contractual
questions
governed
by
the
four-part
workout
agreement.
i
think
this
court's
rulings
and
the
entire
scheme
of
federal
arbitration
is
quite
clear
that
we
don't
treat
arbitrators'
resolution
of
those
questions
the
same
as
we
treat
other
contract
questions.
we
treat
them
the
same
as
we
treat
other
contract
questions
that
have
been
submitted
to
arbitration.
the
first
decisionmaker
is
the
arbitrator,
and
that
decisionmaker
is
entitled
to
a
substantial
amount
of
deference,
and
i
think
that
should
be
the
same
rule
in
this
case.
i
think
what
we
come
down
to
at
bottom,
and
this
is
clear
from
your
questions,
justice
breyer,
what
we
come
down
to
at
bottom
is
a
question
of
what
should
the
rule
be--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--by
a
clear
and
unmistakable
submission...
i
think
we
should
go
back
to
what
we
mean
by
that
language
in
at&t
technologies,
and
again,
that
was
a
case
where
the
issue
came
up
in
the
first
instance
in
the
courts,
and
the
court
was
speculating
as
to,
well,
what
would
the
rule
be
if
one
party
is
saying,
but
they
agreed
to
submit
this
to
arbitration,
so
you
should
submit
it
to
arbitration?
they
agreed
to
submit
the
arbitrability
issue.
there
can
be
doubt
about
that.
did
they
really
agree
to
that?
before
the
courts
can
compel
somebody
to
go
to
arbitration,
the
courts
should
determine
that
they
clearly
and
unmistakably
agreed
to
do
that.
here,
we
have
a
very
different
situation.
the
party
that's
objecting
to
arbitration
did,
in
fact,
submit
that
issue
to
arbitration.
they
did--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--exactly.
the
submission
of
the
issue
to
arbitration
is
a
clear
and
unmistakable
agreement
to
submit
the
issue
to
arbitration.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
right.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
right--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--that
comes
from
the
at&t
technologies
case--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--and
it's
completely
different
from
this
situation,
and
i
think
you're
exactly
right,
the
question
of
whether
the
parties
have
agreed
to
arbitration
is
a
different
question
from
whether
the
case
is
arbitrable--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--and
i
think
the
submission
in
this
case
is
the
key
indication
that
they've
agreed
to
submit.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--i
think--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--i
suggest
that
when
the
gentleman
showed
up
with
the
bulldozer,
you
had
a
few
fewer
options
than
mr.
kaplan
had.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
mr.
kaplan
had
the
right
to
refuse
to
go
ahead
with
arbitration.
i
am
not
going
to
go
ahead
with
arbitration.
nobody
would
have
bulldozed
his
house,
and
nobody
would
have
seized
his
bank
account.
mr.
kaplan
also
had
the
right,
if
he
objected
that
way,
to
proceed
to
federal
court,
but
he
also
had
the
right
to
ask
the
arbitrators
to
decide
that
issue.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
he
could
have
gone
and
said,
i
object
to
arbitrability
and
i'm
going
to...
i'm
not
going
to
show
up.
i'm
going
to
go
to
federal
court--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--and
i'm
going
to
require
you
to
go
to
court.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
there
is,
and
that's
often
in
the
rules
that
parties
have
agreed
to.
in
this
case,
in
the
philadelphia
exchange
rules,
there
was
a
provision
that
if
a
party
doesn't
show
up
he
can
be
subjected
to
liability,
and
that's
one
of
the
reason
why
in
some
situations
merely
refusing
to
show
up
may
not
be
an
adequate
remedy.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
but
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
so
much
whether
there's
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
the
question
is,
how
do
we
treat
the
decision
on
the
agreement
to
arbitrate?
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
in
this
case
there
are
four
different
ways
in
which
arbitrability
could
have
been
found.
the
four-part
workout
document
was
one
of
them.
the
philadelphia
exchange
rules
in
two
different
ways
was
another
one,
and
there
was
a
waiver
argument
as
well,
so
it's
not
just
the
contract.
there's
a
four-part
workout
document.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
the
waiver
argument
is
that
they
initially
filed
objections
to
arbitrability.
they
showed
up
at
a
prehearing
conference
and
specifically
withdrew
those
objections.
they
didn't
raise
them
again
until
2
years
later.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
not
a
lot.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
i
assume
the
parties
spent
time
during
those
2
years
preparing
their
case
and
working
on
their
witnesses.
there
was
nothing
formal.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
the
arbitrator,
the
arbitration
panel
was
not
doing
anything
during
that
time,
but
that
waiver,
if
it
took
place,
took
place
in
front
of
the
arbitration
panel.
this
was
a
prehearing
conference
in
front
of
the
arbitration
panel.
they
were
there,
and
certainly
they--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--no,
that's
not
correct.
in
this
prehearing
conference
they
withdrew
their
objections
to
arbitrability.
the
parties
disagree
as
to
whether
they
withdrew
those
objections
for
the
purpose
of
proceeding
with
that
conference,
or
whether
they
withdrew
them
in
a
more
general
sense,
which
is
our
position.
then
2
years
passed.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
we
give
those
parties
the
alternative
to
either
refuse
to
arbitrate,
which
can
be
a
viable
option
in
some
cases,
or
to
go
to
federal
court
themselves,
or
to
submit
the
arbitrability
issue
along
with
everything
else
to
the
arbitrators,
and
in
this
case
that's
what
the
parties
did,
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
there's
an
agreement
to
arbitrate,
but
whether,
when
the
parties
decided
to
go
ahead
and
submit
that
issue--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--yes.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
two
points
about
that.
first
of
all,
there
have
been
several
circuits
that
have
had
this
rule
for
quite
some
time,
and
we
haven't
found
that
to
be
a
huge
problem.
the
parties
in
those
circuits
defer
to
the...
decide
to
go
ahead
with
the
arbitration
and
have
the
arbitrators
decide
the
issue.
the
second
point
is,
we're
not
saying
that
the
parties
get
no
review
at
that
point.
if
the
arbitration
decision
on
arbitrability
is
off
the
wall,
or
implausible,
as
judge
kozinski
said
in
a
very
similar
case,
they
still
get
review,
but
the
arbitration
decision
is
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
my
time
is
up,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
i
think
that
question
is
pretty
well
addressed
in
the
briefs,
and
i
think
it's
of
diminished
importance
depending
upon
the
outcome
of
the
first
question.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
thank
you.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
thank
you.
i
think
everyone
in
this
case
agrees
that
the
parties
are
entitled
to
allow
the
arbitrators
to
decide
the
issue
of
arbitrability.
the
only
question
is
how
they
do
that,
or
how
they
signal
that,
whether
that
has
to
be
for
some
reason
especially
clear
and
unmistakable,
and
that
the
action
of
submitting
it
to
the
arbitrators
itself
is
not
enough.
i
believe
the
argument
that
mr.
roberts
makes
that
submission
must
be
especially
clear
and
unmistakable,
and
must
include
language
saying,
yes,
i
agree
to
be
permanently
bound
by
this,
or
to
waive
de
novo
review,
is
based
on
a
misreading
of
this
court's
cases
in
john
wiley
and
sons,
warrior
&
gulf,
and
at&t
technologies.
in
none
of
those
cases,
remember,
had
an
arbitrator
decided
the
issue
of
arbitrability,
and
the
central
principal
underlying
those
cases
is
not
involved
here.
the
issue
there
was
whether
the
courts
could
compel
a
party
to
submit
a
dispute
to
arbitration
without
first
determining
that
the
party
had
agreed
to
arbitrate.
as
the
court
put
it
in
john
wiley,
a
compulsory
submission
to
arbitration
cannot
precede
a
judicial
determination
because
a
party
can't
be
compelled
to
arbitrate
if
arbitration
does
not
bind
it
at
all.
nobody
compelled
the
kaplans
to
submit
their
arbitrability
objections
to
the
arbitrator
in
this
case.
they
asked
the
arbitration
panel
to
rule
on
arbitrability,
and
having
done
so,
they're
bound
by
the
result,
and
the
only
question
that
really
is
before
this
court
is
whether
their
act
of
submission
constitutes
an
agreement
to
submit
that
issue
and
have
it
considered
in
a
binding
way
by
the
arbitrators.
there
were--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--right.
if
they
want
to
do
that,
if
they
want
to
preserve
judicial
review
de
novo,
they
have
to
get
the
court
to
do
it
initially.
now,
perhaps
i'm
wrong
about
saying
the
george
day
rule
is
wrong,
and
that
we
should
have
an
initial
objection,
and
that
should
suffice,
but
that's
not
this
case.
there's
no
initial
objection
here,
there
was
actual
submission,
so
that
wouldn't
determine
the
outcome
of
the
case
and
shouldn't
be
decided
here.
i
think
the
notion
that
there's
some
special
magic
to
going
to
court
and
getting
a
de
novo
review
is
a
manifestation
of
the
old
hostility
to
arbitration.
parties
submit
this
issue
to
arbitration
all
the
time.
