are
you
saying
if
they
had
not
done
that,
they
had
just
said
to
the
arbitrator,
we
don't
think
you
have
this
authority,
but
we
won't
argue
it
because
we
don't
want
to
waive
it,
would
they
then
have
been
entitled
to
de
novo
review?

if
they
had

they
have

not
made

unless
the
district
judge
took
this

say,

but
you
couldn't
say
that
would
be
clearly
erroneous.
