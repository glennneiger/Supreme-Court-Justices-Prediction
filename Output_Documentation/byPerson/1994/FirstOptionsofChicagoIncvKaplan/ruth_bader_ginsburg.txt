justice

but
you
say
consent
of
the
parties,
and
this
is
what
puzzles
me
about
your
case.
you
seem
to
make
no
distinction
at
all
between
the
question
that
typically
would
come
up
under
a
labor
arbitration
of
what...
the
what
question,
what
is
arbitrable--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--from
who
submitted
to
arbitration,
and
here
we
have
that
who
submitted
to
arbitration,
and
on
that
question,
like
a
personal
jurisdiction
question,
what
authority
is
there
that
who
is
treated
just
like
what,
and
that
if
you
put
it
before
the
arbitrator,
then
you
get,
in
essence,
what
the
old
special
appearance
was.
you
can
argue
jurisdiction.
if
you
lose
on
that,
forget
it,
you're
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
there's
no
difference
between
a
who
and
a
what
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
agreed
that
the
starting
point
is
there
must
be
a
clear
and
unmistakable
submission
of
the
issue.
whether
it's
the
who
question
or
the
what
question,
there
must
be
a
clear
and
unmistakable
submission,
and
everything
else
about
who
is
parties
can
preserve
the
question
of
whether
the
tribunal
has
authority
over
them,
so
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
presumption
going
in?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
the
clear
and
unmistakable
standard
doesn't
apply,
or
that
when
they
go
to
the
arbitrator
and
say,
we
don't
think
we
belong
before
you
but
we're
ready
to
let
you
decide
it,
that
that's
a
clear
and
unmistakable
submission
that
the
arbitrators'
decision
will
get
only
deferential
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
much
different
argument.
you're
saying...
first,
i
don't
see
where
they
said
we
specifically
waive.
they
argued
against,
in
effect,
personal
jurisdiction
before
the
arbitrator.
they
lost.
they
went
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
essence
of
your
argument,
i
take
it,
is
that
everything
must
be
made
a
federal
case
by
the
person
who
says,
i
never
agreed
to
arbitrate,
because
you
can't...
if
you
put
it
to
the
arbitrator
and
the
arbitrator
agrees,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter,
and
the
litigation
becomes
unnecessary.
you
make
litigation
in
federal
court
necessary
for
everyone
who
says,
i
didn't
agree
to
submit
myself
to
arbitration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
gather
that
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
if
you
want
to
protect
your
right
to
a
federal
forum,
you
must
go
to
federal
court,
you
cannot
hope
that
the
arbitrator
will
say,
right,
you
never
agreed
to
arbitrate,
which
would
leave
out
a
certain
number
of
these
cases,
but
every
time
a
person
says,
i
didn't
agree
to
arbitrate,
it
must
be
brought
up
in
federal
court,
otherwise
you
lose
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
what
about
the
submission
of
the
counterclaim,
which
wasn't
compulsory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
that
a
submission
to
the
authority
of
the
arbitrator?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
far
as
the
difference
that
has
been
described
as
personal
jurisdiction
versus
subject
matter,
who
and
what,
you
have
been
candid
in
saying
you
don't
draw
that
line,
and
i'm
curious
why--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
don't
say
that
it's
a
different
question,
once
they
agreed
to
arbitration,
what
was
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
from,
did
they
ever
agree
to
arbitrate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
practically,
the
kaplans
must
show
up,
because
mki
unquestionably
has
submitted
to
arbitration--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
not
as
individuals,
but
as...
and
on
the
closeness
of
the
mki,
so
that
they
were
interchangeable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
issue
is
in
fact
that
if
they...
to
preserve
that,
they
must
get
into
a
federal
court.
as
mr.
roberts
pointed
out,
the
case
could
wash
in
many
ways
before
the
arbitrators,
so
the
issue...
there
would
never
have
to
be
any
federal
litigation.
