chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
emphasized
as
recently
as
mastrobuono
that
arbitration
is
a
matter
of
contract,
of
agreement
between
the
parties.
a
party
cannot
be
forced
to
enter
into
binding
arbitration
unless
it
has
agreed
to
do
so
and
because
arbitration
involves
the
relinquishment
of
constitutional
rights,
this
court
has
held
that
the
question
of
arbitrability...
did
the
parties
agree
to
arbitrate
+/?
is
for
the
courts
to
decide,
not
arbitrators,
unless
the
parties
"clearly
and
unmistakable
provide
otherwise".
here,
the
kaplans
never
signed
an
agreement--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
arbitrability,
and
the
question
in
this
case
is,
did
the
kaplans
agree
to
arbitrate
that
question,
the
question
of
arbitrability?
did
they
agree
to
be
bound
by
the
arbitrator's
decision
on
the
arbitrator's
own
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
other
words,
there
is
an
arbitration
contract,
and
there's
a
dispute.
is
that...
that's
also
called
arbitrability.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
term
is
used
simultaneously
in
both
instances.
this
case
is
the
question
of
arbitrability
of
arbitrability.
did
we
say,
we
don't
think
there's
any
arbitral
jurisdiction,
but
we're
going
to
let
the
arbitrators
be
judge
in
their
own
case,
and
decide
whether
there's
arbitral
jurisdiction,
and
in
that
instance,
as
the
court
said
in
the
at&t
case,
the
party
arguing
that
that
situation
is
applied
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
by
a
clear
demonstration
of
evidence
and
clearly
and
unmistakably.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
in
both
instances
the
appropriate
standard
of
review
is
de
novo.
it
calls
for
a
judicial
determination.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
i
do,
and
particularly--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
as
a
practical
matter
in
applying
the
standard
there
may
be
a
difference
when
you
have
a
conceded
agreement
to
arbitrate,
and
the
parties
said
yes,
there
is
an
arbitration
agreement
between
us,
but
we
don't
think
this
issue
is
within
it.
there,
it
may
be
more
likely
that
that
would
go
to
the
arbitrators,
but
when
the
basic
claim
is,
we
never
agreed
to
arbitrate
at
all,
then
i
think
you
have
the
clearest
case
for
judicial
determination
and
no
deference
to
the
arbitrators.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
question
is
also
a
question
of
arbitrability.
it's
outside
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
agreement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
it
is
more
likely
that
a
court
will
determine
that
an
issue
is
within
the
scope
of
an
arbitration
clause
if
the
parties
agree
that
there
is
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
likelihood
of
deferring
to
an
arbitrator's
decision
when
the
issue
is,
is
there
an
agreement
to
arbitrate,
is
far...
it's
far
less
likely
that
you
would
defer
to
an
arbitrator's
decision
then.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
the
standard's
different.
the
standard
is
the
same.
it's
de
novo.
it's
a
matter
for
the
courts
to
decide.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
question
here
is
not
even
that
question.
was
that
given
to
the
arbitrator?
the
question
here
is,
did
these
parties
agree
to
let
the
arbitrator
decide
whether
it
was
given
to
the
arbitrator.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
in
other
words,
sort
of
scope
of
the
arbitrator's
authority.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
may
make
more
sense
to
assume
that
the
parties
would
agree
that
it
was
left
to
the
arbitrators,
but
in
a
situation--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--they
may
be,
your
honor,
but
this
one...
this
one
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
guess
my
point
is
that
the
distinction
between
who
and
what
is
not
the
important
distinction.
the
distinction
is,
is
there
an
arbitration
agreement,
and
the
question
is
simply
where
on
the
edges
of
that
agreement
does
this
dispute
lie,
or
is
the
basic
dispute,
is
there
any
kind
of
an
agreement
at
all?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
law,
your
honor.
in
the
former
case,
it
could
be
a
close
case.
for
example,
in
the
labor
context,
where
you
have
an
ongoing
relationship,
parties
will
often
give
the
issue
of
arbitrability
to
the
arbitrators,
but
here,
that's
not
the
context.
the
kaplans
never
signed
an
agreement
with
an
arbitration
in
it.
they
refused
to
sign
the
submission
agreement.
we
heard
that
they
submitted
this
dispute
to
arbitration.
they
expressly
refused
to
sign
the
submission
agreement,
even
though
mki,
the
corporation,
did.
they
filed
a
formal,
written
objection
to
arbitral
jurisdiction
at
the
outset
of
the
proceeding,
and
when
the
proceedings
continued,
they
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
reiterating
their
objection.
against
this
background,
the
third
circuit
correctly
ruled
that
they
did
not
agree
to
arbitrate
any
issue
with
first
options,
let
alone
clearly
and
unmistakably
agree
to
arbitrate
the
issue
of
arbitrability.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
difficult
to
say,
because
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
the
fact
of
the
withdrawal
and
its
scope
are
not
even
docketed
or
noted
in
the
arbitration
record.
the
stipulation
of
the
parties
says
that
we
withdrew
the
objection
from
consideration
at
that
conference,
at
the
february
26,
19--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
in
our
respective
briefs
we
underscore
different
portions--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--of
the
stipulation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
was
a
joint
stipulation,
so
we
preserved
each
argument.
i
think
it's
clear
that
it
doesn't--
[laughter]
from
that
very
ambiguity
shows
that
that
certainly
cannot
be
cited
as
clear
and
unmistakable
evidence
that
we
agreed
to
submit
the
issue
to
bind
mutual
arbitrability
to
binding
arbitration.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly,
under
section
4
of
the
federal--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
there
is.
first,
in
the
first
instance,
did
they
agree
to
arbitrate
a
dispute,
not
arbitrability,
that's
de
novo
review,
straight
contract
interpretation,
but
in
the
arbitrability
question,
at&t
insisted
on
a
higher
standard
i
think
because
you're
asking...
you
would
otherwise
be
asking
the
arbitrators
to
be
the
judge
in
their
own
case,
turn
it
over
to
them.
you
tell
us
whether
you
have
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
judges
are,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
i
think
arbitrators
are
likely
to
find
arbitral
jurisdiction,
and
that's
why
there's
a
higher
standard,
and
why
this
court
in
not
only
at&t,
but
warrior
&
gulf
before
that,
said
that
an
argument
that
arbitrability
had
been
committed
to
the
arbitrators
must
be
shown
by
a
clear
demonstration
of
facts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it
varies
from
arbitral
forum
to
arbitral
forum.
i
don't
think
there's
a
general
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that's
the
general
situation,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'll
do
so
now.
petitioner
argues
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
apply
a
different
standard
of
review
depending
on
whether
the
district
court
upheld
an
arbitration
award
or
vacated
an
arbitration
award.
if
a
district
court
vacates
an
arbitration
award,
that's
normal
appellate
review,
plenary
review
of
questions
of
law,
clearly
erroneous
questions
of
fact,
but
they
say
if
the
district
court
upholds
the
arbitration
award,
you
should
apply
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
they
cite
the
eleventh
circuit
for
that
rule.
i
think
this
court
should
adhere
to
the
rule
that
prevails
in
at
least
nine
other
circuits,
which
is,
you
apply
normal
appellate
review
regardless
of
the
outcome
below.
standards
of
appellate
review
should
depend
on
the
institutional
capabilities
of
the
respective
courts
and
the
nature
of
the
issue,
not
who
won.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
plenary
review
of
questions
of
law,
and
clearly
erroneous
review
of
questions
of
fact.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
district
court
is
supposed
to
find
that
it
was
submitted
to
arbitration,
if
it's
the
question
of
arbitrability,
as
in
our
case,
by
clear
and
unmistakable
evidence,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
that
steps
into
the
shoes
of
the
district
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
are--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
is
complicated
in
some
situations.
this
one
doesn't
strike
me
as
a
complicated
situation
because
there
is
no
contract
between
these
parties
providing
for
any
kind
of
arbitration,
let
alone
arbitration
of
the
issue
of
arbitrability.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
conclude
that
the
district
court's
finding
was
clearly
erroneous,
and
to
the
extent
it
relied
upon
that
waiver,
and
again,
that's
not
even
docketed
in
the
arbitration
record,
so
it's
difficult
to
debate
too
much
what
happened.
it's
certain--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--first,
it's
very
unclear
whether
those
were
compulsory
counterclaims
or
not,
and
once
the
kaplans...
first
of
all,
mrs.
kaplan
did
not
submit
any
counterclaims,
so
that
rationale
would
not
apply
to
submitting
her
to
arbitral
jurisdiction,
but
once
the
arbitrators
had
decided
to
go
forward,
it
would
have
been
foolhardy
for
mr.
kaplan
to
sit
on
his
rights
and
not
raise
his
claims
so
that
they
wouldn't
have
a
full
picture
of
what
happened
under
his
version
of
the
facts.
there's
no
requirement.
if
you
have
objected
to
jurisdiction,
done
your
best
to
explain
to
the
arbitrators
why
they
have
no
jurisdiction,
and
they're
going
to
go
ahead
anyway,
you
had
better
put
in
your
side
of
the
story,
or
you
may
well
have
been
held
to
have
lost
it
later
on
if
a
court
does
not
agree
with
your
jurisdictional
position.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
arbitration
is
a
matter
of
contract,
and
the
question
is,
is
this
within
the
scope
of
the
contract,
and
if,
for
example,
you
have
an
agreement
with
a
broker
to
arbitrate
issues,
disputes
with
respect
to
investments,
and
you're
walking
down
the
street,
and
your
broker
happens
to
be
driving
by
and
hits
you,
your
tort
suit
is
not
subject
to
that
arbitration
agreement,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
as
clear
as
a
situation
where
you
have
a
contract
between
first
options
and
mki
investments
with
an
arbitration
clause,
and
they
try
to
say,
well,
because
of
that
contract,
you,
mr.
and
mrs.
kaplan,
have
to
arbitrate.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
distinction
is
between
the
scope
of
the
contract
and
not
whether
it
covers
individuals
or
events.
contracts
and
agreements
to
arbitrate
can
single
out
particular
disputes
and
events,
and
can
single
out
particular
individuals.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
it's
a
workable
distinction,
although
i
think
it
may
have
been
just
backed
to
where
we
were
a
while
ago,
in
suggesting
when
you
have
a
conceded
agreement
to
arbitrate
between
parties,
the
questions
are
going
to
be
closer
than
when
the
basic
dispute
is
over
whether
there's
an
agreement
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
again
there
are
questions,
though,
about
the
scope
of
a
conceded
agreement.
when
the
dispute
is,
there
was
no
agreement,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
questions
are
not
close,
and
you're
in
at&t's
clear
and
unmistakable
evidence
standard.
now,
the
approach
of
the
third
circuit,
which
is
also
the
approach
in
the
first,
the
fourth,
the
seventh,
and
the
d.c.
circuits,
allows
arbitrators
to
consider
jurisdictional
objections
in
the
first
instance
without
penalizing
a
party
by
saying
that
it
forfeits
its
right
to
a
judicial
determination
of
arbitrability.
the
main
benefit
of
that
approach
is
that
it
may
obviate
the
need
for
court
involvement
at
all
if
the
objecting
party
wins,
if
the
arbitrators
arrive
at
a
compromise,
or
if
the
development
of
evidence
before
the
arbitrators
dissuades
the
objecting
party
from
pursuing
its
objection.
petitioner's
approach
would
require,
as
counsel
recognized
this
morning,
resort
to
courts
every
time
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
arbitrability
and
the
objecting
party
desired
to
preserve
its
right
to
a
judicial
determination
of
that
issue.
it
would,
to
borrow
language
from
the
allied-bruce
terminex
case,
be
breeding
litigation
from
a
statute
that
seeks
to
avoid
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
depends
on
what
the
rules
of
the
arbitration
forum
provide.
here,
the
rules
of
the
philadelphia
exchange
said
if
you
don't
show
up,
the
arbitrators
can
go
ahead
without
you,
and
so
what
the
petitioner
apparently
would
have
us
do
is
show
up,
because
we
don't
want
a
default
entered,
object
in
some
way
so
that
we
don't
waive
our
objection,
but
don't
say
too
much,
because
if
we
say
too
much,
then
we're
going
to
be
held
to
have
submitted
the
issue
to
the
arbitrators.
that's
a
very
fine
line,
and
it's
a
fine
line
in
an
area
where
the
court
has
emphasized
we
don't
want
fine
lines.
if
you're
going
to
tell
us
that
this
person
agreed
to
arbitrate
arbitrability,
you
have
to
show
that
by
a
clear
demonstration,
as
the
court
said
in
warrior
and
gulf,
or
clearly
and
unmistakably,
as
it
said
in
at&t.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
was
argued
by
the
petitioners.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
that
was
not
a
proper
basis
for
exercising
jurisdiction.
you
had
in
the
workout
agreement
four
separate
contracts.
only
one
contained
an
arbitration
clause.
that
was
signed
only
by
first
options
and
mki,
and
the
kaplans
only
signed
one,
and
it
did
not
contain
an
arbitration
clause.
now,
the
district
court,
reading
those,
said
well,
we're
going
to
read
them
altogether
so
that
everybody
arbitrates,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
more
natural
reading
is
to
say,
they
knew
how
to
put
an
arbitration
clause
in
the
contract
when
they
wanted
to,
and
they
didn't
put
one
in
the
one
that
the
individual
signed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
there
was
a
stipulation
of
facts,
and
the
parties
agreed
that
there
was
no
need
for
a
hearing,
or
the
taking
of
any
witness
testimony.
now,
in
considering
whether
to
defer
to
an
arbitrator's
decision
on
arbitrability,
i
think
it's
important
to
consider
why
we
defer
to
arbitrators'
decisions
on
the
merits
when
we
do
defer.
it
is
not
because
of
any
presumed
experience
or
expertise
on
the
part
of
the
arbitrator.
parties
can
choose
anyone
they
want
to
be
their
arbitrator.
it
is
because
the
parties
have
agreed
to
be
bound
by
the
arbitrator's
decision,
not
the
courts,
and
any
more
searching
judicial
review
would
in
effect
substitute
the
court's
decision
for
that
of
the
arbitrator's.
it
would
undermine
the
parties'
agreement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
absolutely.
we
don't
dispute
that
parties
can,
if
they
do
it
clearly
and
unmistakably,
agree
to
have--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
is
not...
particularly
in
at&t,
the
court
said
the
usual
way
you
do
that
is
by
stipulation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
petitioner
today
refused
to
acknowledge--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
simply
saying
they
weren't
giving
up
their
right--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--had
the
effect
of
preserving
their
right--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
i
think
that's
true.
the
agreement
to
be
bound
is
the
basis
for
deference.
when
the
very
question
is,
is
there
an
agreement
to
be
bound,
there's
no
basis
for
deference.
now,
we
didn't
hear
much
about
the
federal
arbitration
act
from
the
petitioner,
and
i
think
the
reason
is
that
it
strongly
supports
the
third
circuit's
position.
the
federal
arbitration
act
provides
for
post
arbitration
vacatur
of
an
arbitral
decision
if
the
arbitrators
exceeded
their
powers.
section
10(a)(4).
it
doesn't
provide
any
mechanism
for
a
prearbitration
determination
of
arbitrability
on
the
part
of
an
objecting
party.
now,
we
are
not
saying
that
there
is
no
such
judicial
remedy,
but
we
do
think
it's
hard
to
argue
that
the
act
contemplates
only
prearbitration
judicial
determinations
of
arbitrability
when
the
only
mechanism
in
the
act
is
for
post
arbitration
determinations
of
arbitrability,
and
if
you
look
at
section
10(a),
it
seems
clear
that
the
10(a)(4)
determination
that
the
arbitrators
exceeded
their
powers
is
one
that
calls
for
de
novo
judicial
review.
the
reason
is
that
the
other
subsections
plainly
do.
10(a)(1),
the
arbitrators
were
corrupt,
or
guilty
of
fraud.
10(a)(2),
they
were
guilty
of
bias.
10(a)(3),
they
were
guilty
of
misconduct.
those
are
not
determinations,
by
their
nature,
in
which
a
court
would
defer
to
what
the
arbitrators
thought.
a
court
is
not
going
to
defer
to
the
arbitrator's
decision
upon
careful
consideration
that
they're
not
corrupt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
parties
have
clearly
and
unmistakably
agreed
that
the
arbitrator
is
to
decide
arbitrability--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--then
his
decision
on
arbitrability
is
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
not
in
excess
of
his
powers,
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
think
it
should
be
subject
to
the
deferential
standard
of
review--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
the
parties
have
clearly
and
unmistakably
agreed
to
commit
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
the
arbitrators.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
all
jurisdictional
matters,
just
the
allegations
that
the
arbitrators
exceeded
their
powers,
and
if
there
is
an
agreement
to
commit
that
to
the
arbitrators'
decision,
it's
not
in
excess
of
its
powers.
the
provision
obviously--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--contomplates
a
distinction
between--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--a
wrong
decision
and
a
decision
in
excess
of
their
powers.
now,
the
petitioner
also
argues
that
the
result
in
this
case
is
somehow
unfair,
because
the
kaplans
were
able
to
renew
their
jurisdictional
objection
in
court
after
having
proceeded
to
have
the
merits
decided
by
the
arbitrators,
but
the
kaplans
did
not
want
the
arbitrators
to
decide
the
merits.
they
never
signed
an
arbitration
agreement,
refused
to
sign
the
submission
agreement,
formally
objected
to
the
arbitrator's
jurisdiction,
and
moved
to
dismiss.
the
situation
that
the
petitioner
objects
to
is,
of
course,
the
same
situation
that
applies
to
a
party
who
objects
to
jurisdiction
in
district
court.
they
are
not
only
allowed
to
go
ahead
to
trial
on
the
merits
if
they
lose
on
jurisdiction,
but
they
must
do
so
before
they
can
renew
their
objection
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
thank
you,
your
honor.
