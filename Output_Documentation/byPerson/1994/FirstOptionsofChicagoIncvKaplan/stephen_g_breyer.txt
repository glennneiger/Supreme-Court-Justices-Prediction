justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--this
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
that's
what
i
wonder,
maybe.
why
should
we
decide
this
question,
aside
from
the
fact
we
granted
cert
to
decide
it,
but
the...
look,
as
i
understand
it,
someone
has
a
piece
of
paper
called
a
contract,
and
it's
filled
with
references
to
arbitration.
and
then
they
get
into
a
fight.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
question
is,
is
this
part
of
the
thing
subject
to
arbitration,
and
smith
says
it
is,
and
jones
says
it
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that
fight,
they're
free
to
submit
to
arbitration,
aren't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
whole
question
is,
have
they
agreed
to
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
what
about
our
old
friend
the
objective
theory
of
contracts,
which
i
guess
was
invented
by
christopher
columbus
langdell,
or
galileo,
or
williston
or
someone,
where
what
you
do
is
say
to
the
district
judge,
this
is
a
contracts
question
like
many
others.
use
the
objective
theory
of
contracts,
look
at
the
circumstances,
and
decide
what
they
agreed
to.
maybe
their
going
to
this
arbitration
reflects
the
fact
that
they
wanted
the
arbitrator
to
decide
it
like
any
other
question.
maybe
it
just
represents
one
of
the
parties
being
dragged
there
kicking
and
screaming,
and
saying,
oh
well,
you
know,
i'm
not
giving
up
my
right
to
court
review.
what
it
does,
in
fact,
depend
on
are
the
circumstances.
why
do
we
need
some
special
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
the
answer
to
that
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
course
is,
in
my
mind
is,
it
shouldn't
be,
but
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
they
did
agree
to
submit
that
question
to
arbitration,
and
obviously
the
parties
could
make
it
clear.
they
could
write
in
their
agreement,
we
are
submitting
the
question
of
whether
this
is
an
arbitrable
question
to
arbitration,
pure
and
simple.
that's
it.
then,
if
the
arbitrator
decided
that,
fine.
it
would
be
like
any
other
question.
they
might
also
say,
by
the
way,
we're
here
kicking
and
screaming.
we
don't
give
up
our
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
we
have
the
ambiguous
middle
case,
which
is
this
one.
so
you
say
to
the
district
judge,
decide
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--contract
decisions,
namely,
you're
trying
to
decide
what
the
parties
agreed
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
well,
that's...
look,
that's
exactly
the
point
that's
bothering
me.
there
is
language
in
a
supreme
court
opinion
that
says
that
the...
this
agreement,
jones
and
smith,
do
you
agree,
jones,
to
submit
the
issue
of
arbitrability
to
arbitration?
jones:
yes,
i
do.
jones:
do
you
agree
to
build
my
house?
smith:
yes,
i
do.
why
does
the
first
agreement
have
to
be
clear
and
unmistakable,
but
the
second
doesn't?
i
mean,
why...
why
can't
you
just
say,
look,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
they
agreed
to
submit
the
arbitrability
issue
to
arbitration.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
issue
is
whether
they
agreed
to
submit
the
house
issue
to
arbitration,
and
then
you
just
look
at
it
like
any
other
agreement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
there
is
this
language,
though,
about
clear
and
unmistakable,
but
i
don't
see
where
in
the
arbitration
act
that
policy
would
come
from
and,
indeed,
you
might
think
it
was
the
opposite,
if
anything,
but
i
don't
see
why
it
isn't
neutral.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
could
have
come
out
the
other
way.
that
is,
if
the
arbitrator
had
said,
there
is
no...
they
didn't
agree
to
submit
this
to
arbitration,
and
i
guess
you
would
have
had...
on
your
theory
you
would
have
had
to
say,
they
have
a
right
to
come
into
court
and
try
to
get
the
judge
to
send
it
back
to
arbitration.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
it's
a
typical
contract
question
again,
and
sort
of...
i
mean,
the
law's
so
complicated,
i
hate
to
proliferate
standards
unnecessarily,
so
when
you're
dealing
with
that
first
question,
the
first
one,
namely,
is
there
or
is
there
not
an
agreement
here
to
submit
this
issue,
call
it
x,
because
it
happens
to
be
called,
whether
or
not
there's
an
arbitra...
did
they
or
did
they
not
agree
to
submit
this
issue,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there's
arbitrability,
did
they
agree
to
submit
this
one
itself
to
arbitration?
is
there
some
reason
to
apply
some
specially
strict
standard--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--such
as
clear
and...
i
know
that
there
is
language
to
that
effect.
what
i'm
looking
for,
is
there
a
reason
for
that?
is
there...
i
mean,
if
there
weren't,
you
see,
a
special
standard,
it
would
be
the
same
as
everywhere
else
in
the
law
and
lawyers
would
get
less
confused
and
so
forth.
but
is
there
some
reason
for
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why...
judges
all
the
time
are
judges
in
the
case
of
whether
they
have
jurisdiction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i
mean,
so
why
couldn't
you
have...
what
does
the
arbitrator...
do
you
think
he
cares?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
once
looked
up
these
questions
of
law
versus
fact
in
the
contract
area,
where
a
court
of
appeals
is
supposed
to
review
a
decision
as
to
what
were
the
terms
of
a
contract
by
a
district
court,
and
it
just
struck
me,
it
wasn't
that
simple.
it
seemed
like
quite
a
nightmare--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
to
where
exactly
you
give
deference
to
the
decision,
because
here
we're
really
talking
about...
you're
very
specific.
we're
talking
about
whether,
when
they
went
to
the
arbitrator,
a
term
of
going
to
the
arbitrator
was
the
kaplans
thinking,
we
are
going
to
the
arbitrator
for
an
initial
decision,
but
we
do
not
mean
to
give
up
our
right
to
de
novo
judicial
review
on
the
question
of
arbitrability.
that's
sort
of
like
a
term
of
the
thing.
i
mean,
i'm
just
concerned
about
being
overly
simple
as
to
what
this...
i
agree,
if
you're
willing
to
say,
yes,
the
standards
are
the
same
as
in
any
other
contract
dispute
in
respect
to
judicial
review
at
the
appellate
level
of
the
district
court
decision.
is
that
the
proposition
you'll
stand
by?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
regardless
of
how
complicated
it
is,
and
it
is
complicated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
makes
the
second
question
the
same
as
the
first.
that
is,
assume
that
a
and
b
say,
we
want
the
arbitrator
to
decide
the
question
of
arbitrability.
we
really
want
it.
we're
giving
up
any
de
novo
thing.
and
then
the
arbitrator
does
decide
it.
then,
in
your
view,
that
decision
would
have
the
same
right
to
deference
as
any
other
decision.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
they
clearly
and
unmistak...
in
all
the
situations
you
say,
look,
the
kaplans
are
drawn
into
this.
they
have
to
show
up
and
so
forth,
and
you
gave
a
lot
of
good
reasons
why
they
do,
but
those
reasons,
of
course,
also
show
that
the
fact
of
showing
up
is
not...
whether
you
have
clearly
and
unmistakably
or
not,
they
show
without
any
such
standard,
that
simply
showing
up
is
not
an
agreement
to
give
up
your
right
to
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
that's
why
i
don't
see
the
breeding
litigation.
i
mean,
if
they...
if
you
stay
away
from
the
arbitrator,
maybe
you
could
get
an
injunction,
the
kaplans,
against
the
arbitration.
that's
questionable,
i
guess.
or
you'd
at
least
make
them
run
and
compel
the
arbitration.
that's
the
court
part.
the
kaplans
might
go
there,
and
they
might
say,
hey,
we're
here
anyway.
we
don't
want
to
give
up
a
damn
thing,
but
if
they
want
to
go
decide
this
first,
that's
their...
go
ahead.
that
would
be
clearly
and
unmistakably
that
they
weren't
giving
up
their
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
may
be
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
first
options,
a
securities
company
said
that
mki,
an
investment
company
owed
it
some
money
and
that
mki’s
owners;
the
kaplan
should
make
up
any
deficiency.
there
was
no
agreement
on
this.
the
whole
thing
went
to
arbitration.
the
kaplans
protested;
they
said,
“we
never
agreed
to
arbitrate.”
the
arbitrators
bet,
“oh
yes,
you
did”
and
then
they
went
to
court
and
the
court
said
“no,
the
kaplans
didn’t
ever
agree
to
arbitrate”
and
we
agree
to
review
two
questions
growing
out
of
this.
the
first
question
is
should
a
court
review
an
arbitrator’s
decision
like
this
one
saying,
“you
all
agreed
to
arbitrate”?
should
a
court
review
that
independently
or
should
it
defer
to
the
arbitrator?
now,
this
question
is
not
about
the
merits,
it’s
not
even
about
whether
the
merits
are
arbitral,
it’s
about
who
should
basically
decide
whether
the
merits
are
arbitral,
the
court
or
the
arbitrators?
the
answer
to
the
question
is
easy.
it
depends
upon
what
the
parties
agree,
what
do
the
parties
agree
who
should
decide
the
matter?
that's
because
arbitration
is
a
matter
of
contract
and
the
courts
normally
look
to
the
party’s
intentions
as
with
any
other
contract.
it
isn’t
quite
like
any
other
matter.
as
the
law
does
assume
if
there
is
silence,
if
there
is
ambiguity,
the
court
assumes
that
the
parties
want
the
judges
to
decide
the
matter
independently
unless
they
clearly
indicate
it
to
the
contrary
that's
because
this
matter
is
rather
arcane,
the
parties
probably
didn’t
think
about
it
and
this
presumption
more
or
less
in
the
general
rule
accords
with
their
likely
intent.
the
kaplans
here
did
not
clearly
say
they
wanted
the
arbitrators
to
decide
arbitrability
so
they
win.
the
second
question
is
what
standards
did
courts
of
appeals
use
when
they
review
a
district
court
decision
confirming
in
arbitration
award?
one
circuit
says
especially
lenient
standard.
the
other
circuit
say
normal
standards.
we
decide
that
that
single
circuit
a
voice
crying
in
the
wilderness
is
wrong.
we
agree
with
the
other
circuits.
a
court
should
use
normal
standards
not
some
special
lenient
standard,
that's
because
the
way
courts
of
appeals
review
district
courts
is
really
a
function
of
their
comparative
expertise
and
function
not
a
question
of
the
desirability
of
some
substantive
outcome.
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
is
affirmed.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
