chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-560,
first
options
of
chicago
v.
manuel
kaplan.
mr.
holzhauer,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--not
an
arbitrator's
determination
that
the
parties
have
agreed
to
submit
the
dispute
to
arbitration.
don't
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
a
different
thing
than
whether
the
parties
agreed
to
arbitrate
at
all,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you...
i
thought
in
response
to
a
question
i
asked
you
earlier
you
agreed
that
the
parties
always
had
a
right
to
de
novo
review
of
the
question
of
whether
they
had
agreed
to
arbitrate
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
the
only
way
to
avoid
submission
is
you
don't
simply
say
to
the
arbitrators,
we
didn't
agree
to
submit
this,
or
we
didn't
even
agree
to
arbitrate,
you
must
go
into
district
court
and
get
a...
file
an
unnamed
action
of
some
sort?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
talk
about
arbitrability
as...
when
you
say
arbitrability,
do
you
mean
the
agreement
to
arbitrate,
or
do
you
mean
whether
a
particular
part
of
the
dispute
is
subject
to
the
agreement
to
arbitrate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
you
would
clarify
things
for
several
of
us
up
here
if
you
could
break
it
down
and
look
at
it
as
first,
did
a
party
agree
to
arbitrate
at
all,
and
second,
what
did
the
party
agree
to
arbitrate,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested
in
her
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--isn't
there
a
line
of
authority...
it
may
be
minority
authority
somewhere...
that
says
if
you
don't
show
up
before
the
arbitrator,
you
can
nonetheless
be
held
liable
for
the
arbitrator's
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
seems
to
me
it's
all
the
more
important
then
that
there
be
some
clear...
a
finding
that
there's
been
a
clear
agreement
to
arbitrate
in
the
first
place,
if
that
can
happen
to
you
if
you
do
agree
to
arbitrate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
it
was
contested
by
the
respondents
that
the
respondent
individually
ever
agreed
to
arbitrate,
that
they're...
in
those
four
documents.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
waiver
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
had
gone
on
in
the
intervening
2
years?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
anything,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
arbitrator
wasn't
doing
anything.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
holzhauer.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts,
when
you
use
the
term,
arbitrability,
you
mean
the
agreement
of
the
parties
to,
the
consent
of
the
parties
to
have
a
dispute
arbitrated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
how
would
you
describe
a
question
of
whether
a
particular
subject
is
subject
to
the
arbitration
agreement,
which
the
parties
concededly
agreed
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
that's
what
confuses
me.
it
seems
to
me
it's
two
distinct
things,
and
people
call
them
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
talking
judicial
psychology,
or
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
normal
appellate
review
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
about,
say,
the
decision
of
a
court
that
an
agreement
either
was
or
was
not
submitted
to
arbitration?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
is
a
question
of
law,
in
your
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
gather
in
some
circuits,
or
under
some
regimes
of
law,
and
perhaps
state
court,
a
party
can
simply
not
show
up
at
the
arbitration
if
that
party
claims
he
never
agreed
to
arbitrate,
and
will
not
be
defaulted,
or
prevented
from
later
getting
review.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
hear
live
testimony
in
connection
with
its
decision
on
this
respect,
or
did
they
just
review
the
documents?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
holzhauer,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
holzhauer.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
94-560
first
options
of
chicago
v.
kaplan
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
