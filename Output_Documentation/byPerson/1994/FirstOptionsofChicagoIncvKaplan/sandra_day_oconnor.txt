what
was
the
law
in
the
third
circuit
at
the
time
of
this
arbitration?
i
understood
that
the
third
circuit
had
taken
the
position
that
by
objecting
to
the
arbitrator's
jurisdiction,
which
the
respondent
did
here
initially,
a
party
does
not
waive
the
right
to
judicial
determination
of
arbitrability.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.--
--what
if
the
parties
were
expressly
reserved
judicial
review
before
submitting
it
to
the
arbitrator.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
would
force
anybody
who
didn't
want
to
lose
the
right
of
judicial
review
to
litigate
that
issue
first.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
would
force
them
to
litigate
it
in
district
court
if
they
ever
wanted
district
court
review
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
just
seems
to
kind
of
defeat
the
whole
purpose
of
arbitration.
it
just...
it
complicates
life
for
the
courts,
and
it
complicates
life
under
the
arbitration
setup.
i
don't
see
why
we
have
to
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
holzhauer,
are
you
going
to
deal
at
all
with
the
second
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
arbitrators
get
paid
by
the
case
that
they
take
to
arbitrate,
as
opposed
to
a
judge
that
gets
paid
the
same
salary
whether
or
not
the
judge
hears
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
general,
if
you
go
out
and
engage
an
arbitrator,
presumably
they're
paid
by
the
case
they
agree
to
take.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
intend
to
address
the
second
question
on
which
we
granted
certiorari?
