justice
david
h.
souter
was
that
explained
in
the
opening
statement?
could
you
elaborate
on
what
was
said
in
the
opening
statement?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
does
it
indicate?
i
mean,
i...
i
read
it
the
same
way
justice
o'connor
did,
and
i...
i
don't...
what
is
your
reason
for--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
why
did
he
get
into
his
daughter's
hospitalization
and
his
monday
schedule?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
if
he...
if
he
was
denying
the
motion
on
the
ground
that
there
had
not
been
the
specifications
that
rule
10
required,
why
get
into
his
daughter's
medical
condition?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if...
if
we're...
if
we're
going
to
make
an
argument
based
on
what
trial
counsel
could
be
expected
to
do,
why
isn't
it
equally
fair
to
make
an
argument
about
what
trial
judges
could
be
expected
to
do?
and
i
would
have
supposed
that
if
the
trial
judge
was
denying
that
motion
based
on
rule
9
or
rule
10
grounds,
he
would
have
said
i'm
denying
your
motion
because
you
haven't
conformed
with
rule
9
to
put
it
in
writing,
if
that
was
the
case,
or
rule
10,
to
specify
what
you're
supposed
to
specify.
and
he
didn't
do
that.
and
i
am
also
supposing
that
if
he
had
done
anything
like
that,
counsel
would
have
said,
gosh,
judge,
please
give
me
a
piece
of
paper
and
let
me
write
this
out.
so,
why...
why
isn't
it
a...
a
fair
inference,
when
the
judge
says
nothing
about
these
rules,
that
the
judge
in
fact
is
not
relying
on
those
rules
in
any
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
did--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
knew
something
more
than
that,
didn't
he?
he
knew
that
counsel,
who
was
an
officer
of
the
court
and
need
not
be
sworn
in
making
representations
in
that
courtroom,
had
represented
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
the
judge
and
to
the
jury
that
that's
what
the
witnesses
would
testify.
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
i
presume
what
he
stated
was
not
if
things
go
as
well
for
me
as
possible,
these
people
will
say
as
follows.
i
presume
what
he
said
is,
i
have
these
three
witnesses.
he
described
their
relationship,
their
location,
et
cetera.
and
they
will
testify
that
the
defendant
was
in
california
at
the
time.
i
presume
that's
what
he
represented
in
open
court.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
of
course,
i
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
is
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
trial
judge's
reasons
when
it
reviews
the
adequacy
of
those
reasons
for
granting
the
motion.
so,
if
the
trial
judge's
reasons
do
not
look...
do
not
reasonably
refer
to
rule
10,
then
i
suppose
on
anybody's
theory,
the
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
have
to
search
the
record.
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
all
i'm...
all
i'm
saying
is
that
i
thought
what
the...
the
state
court
of
appeals
would
review
would
be
the...
the
reasons
given
by
the
trial
judge
for
ruling
as
he
did.
isn't
that
correct?
