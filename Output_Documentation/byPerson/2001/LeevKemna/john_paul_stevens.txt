justice
john
paul
stevens
these
were
sequestered
witnesses,
as
i
remember
it.
at
the
time
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
did
the
lawyer
point
out
that
the
bailiff,
or
whoever
it
was,
had
told
them
they
would
be
excused
for
the...
till
the
next
day?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wasn't
until
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
also
have
to
factor
in
the
fact
they
were
sequestered
witnesses
not
in
contact
with
any
of
these
people
you're
discussing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
defendant
was
in
custody,
was
he
not,
during--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so,
they
didn't
have
actual
contact
with
him.
they
couldn't
have
gone
in
and
said,
hey,
we're
going
to
lunch.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
filed
by
the
same
lawyer
who
represented
him
during
the
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know.
he
wanted
to
get
out
of
there
because
he
wasn't
going
to
get
paid
even
for
the
notice
of
appeal.
it
seemed
to
me
he
was
anxious.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
once
he
had
gotten
fee
for
what
had
been
done,
he
sort
of
lost
interest
in
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt?
isn't
it
orrect
that
the
witnesses
were
sequestered,
and
the
one
person
who
would
know
where
they
were
would
be
a
court
employee
who
had...
in
charge
of
the
sequestered
witnesses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
trial
counsel
was
in
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
just
tell
me
on
that,
what
could
he
have
told
the
judge
that
he
knew
that
he
didn't
tell
the
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he...
the
judge
knew
what
testimony
they
were
going
to
give.
you
don't
question
that,
do
you,
that
there--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--didn't...
didn't
the
lawyer
announce
it
in
his
opening
statement
to
the
jury?
isn't
that
one
reason
it
was
so...
so
prejudicial
that
they
didn't
show
up?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
judge
heard
the
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
knew
what
the
witnesses
were
intended
to
testify
to,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
did
know
that
much,
don't
you
agree?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
later
file
affidavits
substantiating
what
the...
was
said
in
the
opening
statement,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
later
file
affidavits
consistent
with
what
the
counsel
had
said
in
his
opening
statement.
