and
they
had
come
voluntarily.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
had
not
come
by
subpoena.
they
weren't
subpoenaed
until
they
got
to
missouri.
they
came
there
voluntarily?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
did
it
take
17
months
to
bring
out
the...
the
information
that
a
court
official
told
these
people
their
testimony
wouldn't
be
needed?
was
it
not
needed
at
all
or
not
needed
till
tomorrow?
that's
unclear.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
he
have
any
reason
to
think
that
witnesses
who
had
come
on
their...
by
their
own
expense
all
the
way
from
california
and
who
were
in
the
courtroom
that
very
morning...
they
were
there
at
8:
30,
as
i
understand,
and
at
10
o'clock
they're
still
there.
why
would
he
have
any
reason
to
think
they
would
leave?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
we
have
the
transcript
that
shows
exactly
that.
he
told
the
jury
these
are
the
three
witnesses.
they
will
testify
that
he
was
in
california.
he
described
the
witnesses
and
he
said,
they
will
testify.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
didn't
say,
the
best
thing
that
you
might
infer
from
what
they
testify.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
judge
was
fully
apprised
that
the
defendant
was
expecting
to
put
on
witnesses
and
that
hey
were
alibi
witnesses.
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
how
would
they
know?
how
would
they
know
the
strength
of
the
government's
case
if
they
hadn't
been
there
to
hear
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wilson,
at
the
time
of
the
new
trial
motion,
the
transcript
was
available
to
the
judge
of
the
proceedings?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
concern
with
your
position
is
you
suggest
twice
in
your
brief
that
counsel
ought
to
have
scribbled
out
this
24.09
notice.
he
could
have
had
a
legal
pad
and
scribbled
it
out.
that
seems
inconsistent
with
your
answer
that
you're
not
seeking
to
the
form.
here
is...
is
a
man
on
trial
for
a
very
serious
offense.
the
lawyer
is
faced
with
the
absence
of
the
only
witnesses
he
has.
he's
got
to
do
his
best.
should
he
be
thinking
about
scribbling
anything
on
a
piece
of
paper?
should
he
be...
have
all
of
his
attention
trained
on
how
can
he
do
the
best
for
his
client
under
these
extremely
horrible
circumstances?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
don't
know...
we
don't
know
that...
that
the
idea
of
you
have
to
scribble
something
in
the
court
has
been
around
for
some
time
because,
as
you
said,
there's
no
case
that
presents
precisely
that
situation
where
the
motion
is
in
the...
in
the
heat
trial
something
unexpected
happens.
you
have
no
precedent
that
says,
even
so,
under
the
missouri
rules
you
must
sit
there
in
your
seat
at
counsel
table
and
scribble
out
a
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wilson,
in...
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
hunting
through
the
whole
record,
wouldn't
counsel,
notified
about
the
24.10
requirement,
say,
judges,
you
don't
have
to
read
through
the
whole
record?
i'm
putting
it
all
in
front
of
you,
the
exact
words.
it
will
maybe
be
two
or
three
pages,
but
not
a
whole
record.
shouldn't
the
attorney
be
able
to,
in
this
very
case,
in
a
matter
of
a
few
pages
say
where...
where
it
was
in
the
transcript?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
review
in
this
case
a
judgment
of
the
us
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
that
deals
with
criminal
proceedings
in
missouri
state
courts.
the
petitioner
remon
lee
stood
trial
for
murder
and
alibi
was
his
sole-defense,
reclaimed
he
was
visiting
his
family
in
california
at
the
time
of
the
murder
in
kansas
city.
lee’s
mother,
sister
and
step-father
traveled
voluntarily
from
california
to
kansas
city
to
support
his
alibi
defense.
defense
counsel
previewed
the
witnesses’
testimony
on
voir
dire
and
in
detail
during
his
opening
statement.
both
the
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel
referred
to
the
expected
alibi
testimony
as
the
trial
unfolded.
on
the
morning
of
the
third
and
final
day
of
trial,
lee’s
family
members
came
to
the
courthouse
and
were
seen
in
a
witness
waiting
room
while
the
trial
proceeded.
unaccountably,
they
left
the
building
and
could
not
be
found
when
the
time
came
for
lee
to
present
their
testimony.
lee's
counsel
asked
the
trial
judge
for
an
overnight
continuance
to
enable
him
to
reach
the
witnesses
and
bring
them
back
to
court.
the
judge
refused
to
delay
the
trial
speculating
that
the
witnesses
had
abandonedly.
the
judge
further
stated
he
could
not
resume
that
trial
the
next
day
because
he
had
to
be
with
his
daughter
in
a
hospital
nor
could
he
continue
the
proceedings
the
following
day
because
he
had
another
trial
scheduled
then.
the
trial
resumed
without
any
alibi
testimony.
lee
was
convicted
and
later
sentenced
to
life
imprison
without
possibility
of
parole.
lee
appealed
urging
that
the
denial
of
the
continuous
motion
deprived
him
of
due
process
in
particular
of
a
fair
opportunity
to
defend
against
the
murder
charge.
the
appeals
court
held
that
two
procedural
defects
in
the
presentation
of
lee's
continuance
motion,
barred
consideration
of
his
due
process
plea.
in
the
trial
court,
neither
defect
had
been
raised
by
the
prosecutor
or
noted
by
the
judge.
fist
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
said
missouri
supreme
court
rule
2409
requires
that
continuous
motions
be
made
in
writing
but
this
motion
was
made
only
orally
in
open
court.
second
the
appeals
court
continued
this
request
did
not
set
out
all
the
elements
rule
2410
list
for
continuances
necessitated
by
the
absence
of
witnesses.
we
ultimately
sought
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
federal
court
appending
affidavit
in
which
his
alibi
witnesses
accounted
for
their
absence
they
said
a
court
officer
told
them
to
leave
because
their
testimony
would
not
be
needed
until
the
next
day.
the
witnesses
verified
their
continuing
willingness
to
testify
on
lee's
behalf.
the
federal
trial
and
appeals
courts
nevertheless
declined
to
consider
lee's
due
process
objection
to
the
denial
of
an
overnight
continuance.
they
held
that
the
missouri
appeals
court
has
stated
adequate
procedural
grounds
for
its
decision.
in
the
extraordinary
circumstances
this
case
presents
did
the
former
flaws
and
lee's
continuance
motion
constitutes
state
law
grounds
adequate
to
block
federal
review
of
his
due
process
right
to
defend
lee.
that
is
the
question
on
which
we
grant
a
review,
we
decided
in
lee’s
favor.
we
vacate
the
eight
circuit
judgment
and
remand
the
case
to
that
court
for
consideration
of
lee's
federal
denial
of
due
process
claim.
ordinarily
noncompliance
with
the
firmly
established
regularly
followed
state
rule
will
be
adequate
to
foreclose
review
of
a
federal
claim.
our
precedent
leaves
no
doubt
on
that
score.
there
are
however
exceptional
cases
in
which
exorbitant
application
of
a
generally
sound
procedural
rule
renders
the
state
ground
inadequate
to
block
consideration
of
a
federal
question.
this
is
such
a
case.
three
considerations
in
combination
determined
our
judgment:
first,
when
the
trial
judge
denied
these
motions
he
stated
a
personal
reason
for
insisting
an
immediate
completion
of
the
trial
his
daughter’s
next
day
hospitalization,
a
reason
that
could
not
have
been
countered
by
an
entirely
fault-free
continuance
motion;
second,
no
prior
published
missouri
decision
insisted
on
flawless
continuance
motions
in
the
atypical
circumstances
we
have
here;
the
sudden
unanticipated
and
at
the
time
unexplained
disappearance
of
critical
witnesses;
third
and
most
important,
lee
substantially
complied
with
the
key
rule,
each
of
the
elements
required
by
rule
2410
were
either
covered
by
lee's
oral
motion
or
otherwise
inescapably
apparent
on
the
record.
regarding
rule
2409,
we
agree
with
dissenter
in
the
eight
circuit
that
to
insist
on
a
written
continuance
motion
in
the
heat
of
a
murder
trial
upon
discovery
that
subpoenaed
witnesses
were
suddenly
and
unaccountably
absent
would
inject
an
alice-in-wonderland
quality
into
the
proceedings.
in
sum,
in
lee's
case
no
perceivable
state
interest
would
be
served
by
insistence
on
perfect
compliance
with
the
state
procedural
rules
in
question.
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
failure
meticulously
to
observe
those
rules,
rules
raised
only
on
appeal
and
not
at
trial
when
lee
could
have
cured
an
alleged
defend
do
not
constitute
state
ground
adequate
to
block
review
of
lee's
federal
claim.
we
remand
to
the
case
to
the
eight
circuit
to
consider
the
merits
of
lee's
contention
that
the
trial
judge
by
refusing
to
grant
an
overnight
continuance
denied
him
his
due
process
right
to
put
on
a
defense.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia
and
thomas
joined.
