justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wasn't
there
a
thing
too
that
he's
a
minister,
the
father,
and
he
was
scheduled
to
give
a
sermon
that
night?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
why
do
you
think
that
might
have
been?
i
mean,
why...
why
do
you
think...
i
mean,
i
was
wondering
why
it
wasn't
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
not
to
put
the
thing
in
writing
and
not
to
comply
with
10.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
didn't
say
all
that
in
the
opening
statement,
did
he?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
wonder
why
is
there
no
ineffective
counsel
claim.
why
didn't
the
federal
court
in
this
case
say,
well,
look,
you're
the
lawyer
in
the
state
court
at
the
trial,
didn't
comply
with
rules
9
and
10?
my
goodness,
that
was
in
effective
assistance.
why
didn't
the
habeas
court
say
that
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
didn't
they
say
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now...
now,
that's
exactly
right.
now
i
want
to
know
why
do
you
think
that...
that
that
claim
wasn't
raised
at
that
hearing,
namely,
the
after-the-trial
hearing,
the
post-conviction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
and
what
i'm
really
driving
at
is,
isn't
the
reason
that
they
didn't
raise
rule
9
and
rule
10
as
showing
ineffective
assistance
at
that
post-trial
business
is
because
nobody
dreamt
that
the
courts
in
that
state
of
missouri
would
apply
rule
9
and
rule
10?
because
up
to
that
point,
nobody
had
even
mentioned
them.
they
didn't
get
mentioned
until
the
appellate
court,
after
this
series
of
events,
on
its
own
raises
rule
9
and
rule
10.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
that...
i...
i
mean,
they
have
a
lot
of
cases.
you
know,
and
in
their
reply
brief
they
have...
the
other
side
has
some
that
seem
pretty
much
on
point
against
you.
but
there's
no
case
that
i
can
find
directly
on
point.
direct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so,
if
that...
maybe
you
can
suggest
one,
but
i'll
go
back
and
read
it.
but
the...
the
rule...
the
standard
i
thought
might
be
useful
is
the
standard
in
respect
to
that,
that
did
the
lawyer
have
fair
notice
that
the
rule
exists
and
applies
in
the
circumstances.
now,
maybe
since...
and
it
was
written
in
an
amicus
brief
that
favors
your
side...
maybe
you
approve
of
that
standard.
and
i'd
like
to
know,
a,
do
you
or
not?
and
if
you
do
approve
of
that
standard,
but
i
come
to
the
conclusion
here
that
that
trial
judge
did
not
have
fair
notice
that
the
missouri
rules
would
apply
in
these
circumstances
where
he
was
suddenly
surprised
by
the
loss
of
witnesses
and
nobody
in
the
courtroom
said
a
word
about
9
or
10.
and
nobody
said
anything
about
9
ever,
and
the
appellate
court
went
and
applied
it
for
the
first
time
on
its
own.
that's
a
big
question,
but
it
has
two
parts,
and
i'd
like
an
answer.
the
standard
and
the
application
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
the...
the
three
aspects
of
it
that
suggest
maybe
this
lawyer
did
not
have
fair
notice
that
the
rule
would
apply
in
the
circumstances
are,
first,
the
lawyer
was
surprised
by
his
loss
of
witnesses.
so,
he
didn't
have
time
to
prepare
anything
in
writing
in
advance.
second,
he's
in
the
courtroom
talking
to
the
judge
and
he
knows
full
well
that
everyone
in
that
courtroom
knows
every
single
thing
about
what
rule
9
and
rule
10
require.
there
was
no
missing
fact.
the
judge
knew
it.
the
prosecuting
attorney
knew
it,
and
he
knew
it.
and
third,
there
is
no
missouri
case
that
says
that
we're
going
to
require
a
useless
act
in
the
circumstance
where
the
lawyer
has
suddenly
been
surprised
by
his
loss
of
witnesses
and
everything
is
going
on
orally
in
front
of
the
judge
anyway.
now,
those
are
the
three
that
i
think
cut
against
you,
and
so
i'd
like
your
reply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
going
to
tell
me
right
now...
we
both
read
this
record.
and
are
you
going
to
tell
me
that
in
your
opinion,
the
judge
did
not
know
that
these
witnesses
were
here
to
say
that
the
defendant
was
in
california
at
the
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--actually
i
asked
the
question
that
i'd
like
an
answer
to.
the
question
that
i
asked
you
was
whether
you're
prepared
to
say
right
now
that
the
judge
did
not
know
that
the
purpose
of
these
witnesses
was
to
testify
that
the
defendant
was
in
california
at
the
time.
i
didn't
ask
you
the
question
that
justice
scalia
asked.
i
asked
you
my
question.
i'd
like
to
know
the
answer
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
different...
well,
if
you're...
you're
willing
to
say,
which
i
think
is
fair
and
i
think
correct,
that
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
the
judge
knew
that
the
point
of
these
witnesses
was
to
testify
that
the
defendant
was
in
california
at
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
third
part
which
is...
i...
i
take
it
as
well
that
you
would
agree
that
the
judge
heard
that
this...
the
missing
witness
is
a
minister
who's
there
for
a
religious
event
that's
taking
place
that
evening.
all
right.
so,
we
know
that
9
and
10
were
not
literally
complied
with.
now,
but
they
might
have
been
substantially
complied
with.
and
so,
at
this
point,
when
everybody
knows
in
the
room
what's
going
on,
was
the
lawyer
fairly
apprised
that
what
we
had
to
do
was
perform
what
he
might
have
thought
of
as
a
useless
act?
and
the
case
that's
the
strongest
for
your
yes
answer,
he
had
to
go
through
the
form
even
though
the
substance
was
right
there
in
the
case
of
the
surprise
witnesses...
your
strongest
case
or
two
under
missouri
law
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
if
i
read
through
the
transcript
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
everyone
in
that
courtroom
in
that
very
short
trial,
in
the
circumstances
given
what
was
said,
would
have
very
clear
that
this
lawyer
does
mean
to
tell
the
judge,
one,
these
are
my
own
witnesses
that
make
a
difference.
two,
they're
alibi
witnesses.
three,
they're
going
to
say
he's
in
california.
four,
i
don't
know
why
they
left.
five,
give
me
a
couple
of
hours
or
at
least
till
tomorrow
morning.
he's
giving
a
sermon
downtown
and
i'd
like
to
try
to
find
him.
now,
if
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
any
one
reasonable
person
in
that
courtroom
would
have
thought
that
was...
the
lawyer
was
saying
that
in
the
circumstances,
i
could
hold
against
you.
is
that
right?
if
i
think
that
the
circumstances
were
such
in
the
courtroom
that
anyone
would
have...
any
reasonable
person
would
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
in
effect
what
the
lawyer
was
telling
the
judge.
