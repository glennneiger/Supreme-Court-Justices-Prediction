justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
tell
you...
let
me
tell
you,
counsel,
what...
what
concerns
me
about
your
case.
let's...
let's
assume
that
you
can
convince
us
that
given
the
haste...
the
press
of
trial
and
the
shortness
of
time
that
the
counsel
did
about
all
he
could...
all
he
could
do.
but
there
was
a
post-conviction
new
trial
motion
some
17
days
or...
or
2
weeks
later,
and
at
that
point,
the...
the
counsel
made
no
specific
showing
as
to
why
the
witnesses...
the
mystery
remained.
there
was...
a,
there
was
no
showing
at
all
or
even
mentioned
of
the
fact
that
a
court
officer
might
have
misled
them,
and...
and
b,
we
never
know
why
they
left.
whether...
the
counsel
had
2
weeks
to...
to
supplement
that
motion.
i...
let
me
as
you
this
as
a
predicate.
i
assume
that
the
state
trial
judge
at
the
new
trial
motion
had
the
opportunity
and
the
right
under
state
law
to
revisit
his
ruling
denying
the
continuance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
was
nothing
new
shown
by
counsel
at
that
point.
so,
even
if
you...
if
we
concede
that
the
press
of
trial
and
the
surprise
that
attended
the
disappearance
of
the
witnesses
excused
the
counsel
from
doing
anything
more,
he
surely
is
not
excused
from
this
skimpy
showing
2
weeks
later.
that's
what
bothers
me
about
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you're...
you're
saying
that
missouri,
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
did
not
afford
adequate
opportunity
for
this
attorney
to
explain
the
disappearance
of
his
witnesses.
and
even
if
i
grant
you
that
the
rush
of...
that
the
press
of
time
was
such
that
we
can
excuse
the
performance
at
the...
on
the
day
of
trial--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--2
weeks
later
he
had...
he
had
all
the
opportunity
in
the
world
to
explain
this,
i
think.
now,
judge,
we
were
in
a
hurry
when
you
denied
the
continuance.
maybe
you
didn't
understand
him,
and
here's
what
happened.
he
doesn't
do
that.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
end
of
the
case
from
a
due
process
standpoint.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
missouri
gave
to
the
attorney
the
opportunity
to
revisit
the
entire
matter
at
the
post-conviction
motion
for
a
new
trial,
and
nothing
further
was
adduced.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there's
where
i
disagree
with
you
because
2
weeks
later,
he
didn't
show
anything
more
other
than
they
were
alibi
witnesses.
and
i'll...
i'll
assume,
for
purposes
of
this
question
that
he
knew
that
because
of
the
opening
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
we
don't
need
to
have
at
that
time
because
we
have
the
benefit
of
hindsight
2
weeks
later,
and
you
had
nothing
new.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
please...
please
don't
ask
us
to
write
an
opinion
where
we
tell
judges
it's
wrong
to
tell
counsel
to
hurry
along.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
think
it's
fair
to
say...
or
maybe
it
isn't.
maybe
you
can
argue
with
this...
that
what
the
appellate
court
was
saying
that
at
least
under
24.10,
there
was
an
insufficient
showing,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
trial
judge
found.
the
trial
judge
didn't
cite
24.10.
he
doesn't
say
i'm
ruling
against
you
because
you're
inadequate
of
showing
under
24.10.
but
it's
clearly
implicit
in
his
ruling.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
i
assume...
i
assume
there
are
a
number
of
factors
that
go
into
the
judge's
decision.
one
is
that...
the...
the
court's
own
schedule.
the
other
is
the
reason
these
people
have
gone.
he
says
it
looks
like
your...
you
folks...
i
think
he
said
you
folks
have
been
abandoned
by
these
witnesses.
and
so,
he
gives
a
number
of
reasons,
all
of
which
are
exactly
what
he
has
to
do
under
24.10
even
though
he
doesn't
cite
24.10.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they
might
have
gone
down
to
get
an
apple
out
of
the
vending
machine.
i
mean,
the
counsel
has
got
a
lot
to
do.
he's
got
his
closing...
his
opening
statement
for
the
defense.
he's
got
his
witnesses.
he
goes
down.
they're
not
in
the
room.
i
don't...
i
don't
attribute
much
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and,
of
course,
i
suppose
the
lawyer
knew
what
the
family
would
testify
to
before
they
heard
the
strengths
of
the
prosecution's
case,
which
was
that
there
were
four
witnesses
that
put
him
in...
in
the
city.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
experience
that
witnesses
ever
have
second
thoughts
about
giving
their
story
after
they've
heard
the
strength
of
the
prosecution's
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
don't
want
us
to
decide
this
case
on
the
fact
that
he
didn't
make
an
affidavit,
do
you?
i
mean,
that's
so
easy.
the
judge
puts
him
under
oath
or
gives
him
2
minutes
to
write
something
out.
you're
not
resting
on
that,
are
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--24.10
i
would...
i
would
think.
