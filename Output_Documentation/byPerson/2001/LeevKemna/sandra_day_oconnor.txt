well,
at
least
as
far
as
24.10's
elements
are
concerned,
presumably
those
could
have
been
addressed
by
counsel.
i
mean,
the...
the
different
requirements
could
have
been
orally
presented.
i
would
assume
that
24.10
sets
out
certain
information
that
is
generally
regarded
by
the
state
as...
as
crucial--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
making
the
decision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about...
i
didn't
find
anything
about
that
at
all.
the
sixth
requirement
was
that
the
affiant
knows
of
no
other
person
whose
evidence
or
attendance
he
could
have
procured
at
trial
by
whom
he
could
prove
the
same
facts.
was
that
addressed?
i...
i
didn't
find
it.
perhaps
you
could
point
me
to
where
that
was
addressed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
at
least--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--we
know
that
the...
the
trial
judge
did
not
deny
the
continuance
on
the
basis
of
a
failure
to
comply
with
those
rules,
did
he?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
trial
judge
said,
well,
i
can't
grant
that.
you
didn't
file
it
in
writing.
you
didn't
supply
this
information.
that's
not
in
the
record,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
trial
judge
denied
it
because
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
hospital
with
his
daughter
on
one
day
and
he
had
another
trial
in
another
case
starting
the
day
after.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
witnesses
were
there,
we're
told.
they...
they,
in
fact,
were
there
and
subpoenas
had
issued.
they
were
there.
and
it
is,
i
think,
somewhat
unusual
that
in
the
strange
circumstances
of
their
disappearance,
that
there
wouldn't
be
some
small
amount
of
time
given
to
find
out
what
had
happened.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
were
these
witnesses
in
the
courtroom
to
hear
that
testimony?
i
thought
they
had
been
sequestered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
robin-vergeer,
was
any
due
process
argument
ever
raised
at
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
level?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
the
post-conviction
proceeding,
as
i
recall,
what
was
raised
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
primarily.
