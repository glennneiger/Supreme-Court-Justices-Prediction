chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
00-6933,
remon
lee
v.
mike
kemna.
ms.
vergeer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're...
you're
just
summarizing
now,
i
take
it.
you're
going
to
go
into
more
detail
as
to
why--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
rules
are
arbitrary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
before
the
trial
court,
you
mean
in
the
presentation
made
at
that
time
orally
by
counsel?
answer
that
yes
or
no,
please.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where...
where
else
are
you
saying
it
came
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
the
trial
judge
is
supposed
to
remember
the
opening
statement
by...
by
defense
counsel
when
he
passes
on
a
motion
for
a
continuance
that's
made
at
the
end
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you
say
that
the
trial
judge
knew
it
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
their
purpose
was?
i...
i
didn't
get
that
at
all
out
of
the
transcript.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
counsel
has
to
make
a
showing
of
his
own.
it's
not
just
responding
to
questions
from
the
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what...
what
the
purpose
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's...
it's
odd
in
a
way,
and
perhaps
this
doesn't...
that,
you
know,
you
would
have
to
get
a
capias
and
arrest
your...
your
father-in-law
and
your
mother
and
your
sister.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
rules
for
reviewing
that
sort
of
thing
in
this
court
have
changed
a
good
deal
from
the
time
of
osborne
against
ohio
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
denial
on
the
basis
that
it
hadn't
conformed
to
rules
what?
09
and
10?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
vergeer.
mr.
wilson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
suppose
a
lot
of
judges
concentrate
intently
on
opening
statements
the
way
they
do
perhaps
motions
that
they
have
to
decide
or
something
like
that.
if...
if
some...
in
the
rare
instance
where
opposing
counsel
objects
to
an
opening
statement,
the
judge...
but
certainly
he
doesn't
pay
attention
to
that
the
way
he
would
to
lots
of
other
things
in
the
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
i...
29.09.
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
interpret
it
to
apply
to
things
like
a
motion
for
a
continuance
arising
during
trial
because
it...
well,
it's
very
difficult,
i
would
think,
for
a
lawyer,
suddenly
faced
with
an
emergency
like
this,
to...
you
know,
you
obviously...
you
can't
go
back
to
your
office
and
dictate
a
motion,
and
to
simply
write
out
something
in
longhand
when
perhaps
he
can
simply
make
the
statement
orally.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wilson.
ms.
vergeer,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
vergeer.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
00-6933
lee
versus
kemna
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
