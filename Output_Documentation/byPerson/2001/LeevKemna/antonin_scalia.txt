justice
antonin
scalia
this...
this
goes
to
the
importance
of
those
witnesses.
i
find
it
extraordinary
that
you
didn't
get
a
neighbor
or,
you
know,
somebody
other
than
his
mother,
his
father
or
stepfather,
and
the
sister
to
come
and
testify
he
was
out
there.
nobody
else
saw
him
there?
he...
he
stayed
in
their
home
the
whole
time?
you
know,
if
i
was
looking
for
people
to...
to
bring
to
testify
for
an
alibi...
he
was
there
for
how
long?
for
the
whole
holiday
season?
justice
antonin
scalia
nobody
else
saw
him
there
that
he
could
have
brought
in?
he
has
to
bring
in
his
mother,
his
stepfather,
and
his
sister?
justice
antonin
scalia
do...
do
we
know
that
if
he
had
been
given
the
couple
of
hours'
continuance,
which
is
what
he
asked
for,
you
would
have
located
the
witnesses?
where
did
they
go?
i...
i'm...
that
part
of
the
story
never
comes
out
from
this
stuff.
they...
they
just
disappear
from
the
courthouse.
is
there
any
explanation
of
what
happened
to
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
did
they
go?
i
mean,
had
they
gone
to
a
movie?
i
mean,
if
they
were
not
back
at
the
uncle's
house,
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
unless
it
was
a
very
short
movie.
i
mean,
the
couple
of
hours'
continuance
that
he
asked
for...
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
it
would
have
been...
it
would
have
been
enough,
and
that's
all
he
asked
for.
these
witnesses
just
disappeared
into
thin
air.
we
still
don't
know
where
they
went.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
that,
you
know,
if
he
had
only
gotten
these
couple
of
hours,
everything
would
have
been
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think...
i
think
that's
your
burden.
i
think
you
have
to
show
that
there
was
an
error
that...
that
harmed
your
client,
and...
and
if
the
refusal
to...
to
give
a
couple
of
hours'
continuance...
if
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that...
that
it
caused
any
harm,
what's
the
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
nothing
in
those
facts
that
suggests
you
could
find
them
in
2
hours.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
quoting...
i'm
quoting
from
your
brief.
lee
asked
his
counsel
to
request
a
couple
of
hours'
continuance
to
try
to
locate
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
lee
told
the
court
that
he
knew
the
witnesses
were
still
in
town,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you...
counsel
did
ask
for
a
continuance
until
the
following
morning.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
think
it
was
assurance
that
the
witnesses
would
be
provided
within...
within
the
time
frame
that...
that
they
asked
for.
i
didn't
see
where
that...
that
assurance
was,
and
that's
what...
what.10
requires,
and
that's
what
i
think
the
trial
judge
didn't...
didn't
have,
and
that's
the
reason
he
said,
forget
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
of
the
reasons.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
also
skipped
voluntarily
just
before
they
were
supposed
to
be
put
on
the
stand
under
oath.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
one
factor
that
into
account
as
to
whether
these
witnesses
who
suddenly
vanish
into
thin
air
are
likely
to
be
found?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
there
under
subpoena.
they
knew
that
they
were
going
to
be
testifying
in
an
hour,
and
they
left
without
apparently
telling
the
person
who
had
subpoenaed
them,
their...
their
son's
counsel,
or
anybody
else.
i
mean,
are
those
circumstances
which
would
lead
one
to
believe
that
it's
going
to
be
a
cinch
to
find
these
people
and
bring
them
back
within
a
reasonable
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
their
sequestering
prevent
their
leaving
a
message
with
the...
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
or
a
marshal
or
someone
saying,
tell
my
son
we're
going
because
we
had
a
medical
emergency
or,
you
know...
or
because,
as
the...
as
the
later
story
comes
out,
some
marshal
told
us
to
leave?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
that
so
implausible
that
they
should
just
walk
out,
not
leave
any
word
for...
for
their
son
for
whom
they
were
about
to
testify.
i...
and
i
don't
think,
if
i
were
a
trial
judge,
i
would
have
thought
these
witnesses
are
about
to
be
found
within...
within
a
reasonable
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
they
could
have
told
somebody
to
tell
him,
couldn't
they?
and...
and
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
at
that
time...
this
story
came
up
a
lot
later
after
the...
much
later
than
2
weeks
that...
that
in
fact
it
had
been
some
court
personnel
who
told
them
that
they
were
no
longer
needed.
as
far
as
the
trial
court
knew--
justice
antonin
scalia
did
he
get
in
touch
with
these
people
before...
before
2
weeks...
i
mean,
before
the
motion
for
reconsideration
of...
of
the
denial
of...
of
continuance
came
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
extraordinary.
i
mean,
if
they
were
so
easy
to
find,
one...
one
would
have
thought
that
he
would
have
contacted
them
within
the
2
weeks
and
they
would
have
told
him
within
those
2
weeks
that
a
court
personnel
had
told
us
to
leave.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
doesn't
mention
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--2
weeks
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you...
you
can't
say
that
he...
he
got
in
touch
with
these
witnesses
who
would
have
been
so
easy
to
find
within
a
day.
you
can't
even
say
that
he
got
in
touch
with
them
2
weeks.
justice
antonin
scalia
even...
even
where
it
wasn't...
the
denial
wasn't
based
on
that
basis.
are
any
of
the
other
missouri
cases
involve
a
situation
where
the
trial
judge
did
not
rely
on
9
or
10,
but
nonetheless,
his
action
was
affirmed
on
the
basis
of...
of
failure
to
comply
with
9
or
10?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
the
lawyer's
assurance
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
in
fact
he
did
not
have
the
lawyer's
assurance.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wilson,
i
thought
you
weren't
going
to
rely
very
much
on
the...
on
the
not
written
part,
but
let's
talk
about
the
other
part,
that
all
of
these...
even
if
all
of
these
factors
of
substance
that
had
to
be
in
the
motion
were
somewhere
in
the
trial
transcript
and
even
if
you
could
say
that
this
trial
judge
knew
it,
you
couldn't
say,
could
you,
that
the
court
of
appeals
knew
it,
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
look
back
to
this
motion
without
searching
the
entire
transcript
and
asking
itself,
i
wonder
what,
under
this
transcript,
the
trial
judge
knew?
the...
the
court
of
appeals
in
missouri
could
not
look
at
the
motion
and
say,
well,
he
set
forth
what
he
had
to
say...
set
forth.
that...
that's
clear,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
been
constrained
to
review
the
entire
trial
record,
which
it
is
one
of
the
purposes
of...
of.10
to
avoid.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
purposeless,
even
if
you
assume
that
the
trial
judge
knew
that...
that
in
fact
the
lawyer
was...
was
making
the
affidavit
that
he...
that
he
had
to
make.
