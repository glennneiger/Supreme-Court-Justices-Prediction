ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
remon
lee
is
serving
a
life
sentence
without
possibility
of
parole
for
first
degree
murder
without
ever
having
had
a
chance
to
present
testimony
from
witnesses
who
could
have
established
his
innocence.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
discussing
whether
lee's
failure
to
comply
with
two
missouri
rules
governing
motions
for
continuance
is
an
adequate
state
law
ground
to
bar
consideration
of
lee's
federal
due
process
claim
based
on
the
state
trial
court's
denial
of
a
brief
continuance.
in
the
circumstances
in
which
his
motion
for
a
continuance
was
made,
the
answer
is
no.
under
this
court's
existing
precedents,
missouri
rules
24.09
and
24.10
are
not
adequate
to
bar
review
of
lee's
due
process
claim
because
application
of
the
rules
in...
in
this
case
was
arbitrary
and
serves
no
legitimate
state
interest
where
lee
lacked
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
comply
with
the
letter
of
the
rules
under
the
circumstances,
where
lee
supplied--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--yes.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
correct.
i
was
just
summarizing
for
the
court
the
circumstances
that
made
it
so
that
there
was
no
legitimate
state
interest
served
in
this
case.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
that's--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--that's
correct,
and
every
piece
of
information
required
by
those
rules
were
before
the
trial
court.
the
missouri--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--no.
every
element--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
opening
statement
by
defense
counsel.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
let
me
clarify
a
few
things.
every
element
required
by
the
rules
was...
was
before...
was
stated
by
counsel
or
by
the
defendants
on
the
stand--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
discussion
with
the
trial
court
was...
bear
in
mind
the
discussion
with
the
trial
court
occurred
in
an
emergency
situation
where
witnesses
are
suddenly
gone
and
the...
and
counsel
is
now
before
the
trial
court
explaining
what
had
happened.
everyone
in
the
discussion
knew
who
the
witnesses
were
and
why
they
were
crucial
to
his
defense.
this
was
a
short
trial--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--yes,
and
the
trial
court...
even
in
the
colloquy,
you
can
see
that
the
trial
court
knew
who
the
witnesses
were.
at
one--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--at
one
point
during
the
discussion...
the
only
question
that
the
trial
court
had
for
counsel
was
were
these
witnesses
under
subpoena,
and
counsel
answered
that
question
yes,
twice.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
when
the...
when
counsel
pulled
out
the
subpoenas
and
starting
reading
from
the
subpoena
and
he
read,
gladys
edwards
is
supposed
to
come
on
the
last
day
of
trial
at
9
o'clock,
the
trial
court
responded,
is
she
the
mother,
showing
that
the
trial
court
understood
who
the
witnesses
were.
bear
in
mind
this
was--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--there
was
only
one
issue
in
the
case
and
that
was
whether
the
defendant
was
correctly
identified
by
the
eye
witnesses
or
was
he
somewhere
else.
this
was
the
entire
affirmative
defense
for
mr.
lee.
three
witnesses
were
his
entire
affirmative
defense,
and--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--yes.
in
the
opening
statement,
which
occurred
only
the
day
before
this
exchange
took
place,
counsel
outlined
for
the
trial
court
and
the
jury
the
fact
that
minister
james
edwards,
mr.
lee's
stepfather;
gladys
edwards,
his
mother;
and
laura
lee,
his
sister
had
traveled
from
california
to
testify
that
during
the
period
of
july
through
october
1992,
mr.
lee
had
been
staying
with
them
in
california
and
was
not
in
kansas
city.
and
they...
and
his
statement
provided
certain
details
that
showed
why
they
remembered
when
it
was,
that
he
had
come
out
for
the
birthday
parties
for
himself
and
for
his
niece
and
had
stayed
through
the...
up
to
the
halloween
party.
and
all
of
this
was
laid
out
in
the
opening
statement
and
made
it
clear
that
these
witnesses
were
crucial
to
his
defense
and
is
what
his
entire
defense
was
based
on.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
july
through
october.
the
record
is
silent--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--i...
i
can't
answer
that.
the
record
is
silent
on
who
saw
him.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
correct.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
okay.
as
for
why,
i
was
not
trial
counsel
below.
i
don't
know
why
he
didn't
say
more
in
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
but
i
can
tell
you
that
the
missouri
rules
governing
motions
for
a
new
trial
say
that
when
a...
when
error
is
assigned
at
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
stage...
and
this
is
rule
29.11
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
rules...
that...
and
a
request
is
denied
and
then
that's
made
a
basis
for
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
a
short
general
statement
reiterating
that
ground
is
appropriate
in
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
as
for
why
he
didn't
say
more,
i
can't
answer
that.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
i
have--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--i...
i
disagree.
i
think
that
the
ruling
on
the
motion
for
a
continuance
is
evaluated
ex
ante.
it's
evaluated
at
the
time
that
the
motion
was
denied,
and
at
the
time
that
the
motion
was
denied...
and
the
standard
has
been
stated
in
unger
v.
sarafite.
quote--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
motion
for
a
new
trial
restated
his
grounds
for
granting
a
new
trial,
the
fact
that
the
witnesses
had
come
in...
and
it
did...
it
did
explain
that
they...
these
were
the
alibi
witnesses
from
california...
so
that
was
clear
in
the
motion
for
a
new
trial...
and
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
had
denied
that
motion
without
giving
him
a
short
recess
or
without
enforcing
the
subpoenas.
these
witnesses
were
under
subpoenas,
and
rule
26.03
of
the
missouri
rules
states
that
when
a
witness
doesn't...
isn't
there
for
a
criminal
trial,
he's
under
subpoena,
he's
subject
to
arrest.
there's
no
special
procedural
rule
that
governs
how
that
has
to
happen.
the
judge
took
no
effort
whatsoever
to
enforce
the
subpoenas
in
this
case,
and
we're
talking
about
just
a
short...
a
few
hours'
continuance
to
try
to
figure
out
what
happened
and
to
get
them
in.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
that
was
not
stated
in
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
it
was
in
the
rule
29.15
state
post-conviction
motion
that
that
issue
first
came
up.
but
the
question
of
why
the
witnesses
ultimately
left
and
whether
the
state
was
responsible
for
that
is
really
a
separate
issue.
that
goes
to...
well,
that
may
go
to
cause,
but
it
also
goes
to
whether
he
has
a
separate
due
process
claim
on
that
basis.
it's
not
necessary
to
figure
out
why
the
witnesses
left
to
evaluate
whether
or
not
the
trial
court's
denial
of
a
brief
recess
to
try
to
figure
out
what
happened
to
the
witnesses
was
an
arbitrary
denial--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
reason
why
they
left
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
the
moment
that
the
trial
court
ruled
on
the
motion
for
a
continuance,
he
didn't
know
where
they
were,
counsel
didn't
know
where
they
were,
the
prosecutor
didn't
know
where
they
were.
at
that
moment,
was
it
reasonable
to
deny
him...
i
mean,
the
defendant
only
asked
for
2
hours,
just
a
few
hours--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--there's
nothing
new
in
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
but
no
new
facts
need
to
be
adduced
in
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
it
is
appropriate
in
missouri
to
bring
facts
that
are
outside
of
the
record
in
a
rule
29.15
post-conviction
motion,
and
they
were
brought
up
in
the
rule
29.15
post-conviction
motion.
there's
no
mystery
here
about
why
the
state
trial
court
judge
denied
the
motion,
and
he
denied
it
on
the
merits.
he
did
not
deny
it
because
the
application
was
defective.
the
prosecutor
didn't
object
to
the
application,
either
the
request
for
a
continuance
or
the
form
in
which
the
request
was
made.
had
the
trial
court
or
the
prosecutor
signaled
some
question...
and
again,
bear
in
mind
the
emergency
way
that
this
came
up...
had
signaled
some
question,
he
could
have
cured
it.
and
in
a
way,
you
have
a
kind
of
a
reverse
sandbagging
where
error
is
left
embedded
in
the
record
and
it
isn't
until
the
direct
appeal
2
years
later
that
anyone
suggests
there
was
something
procedurally
defective
about
the
motion.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
well,
the
affidavits
of
the
witnesses
don't
state
where
they
went
when
they
left.
in
the
rule
29.15
post-conviction
motion,
it
states
that
they
went
to
a
relative's
house.
the
defendant
represented
to
the
trial
court
at
the
time
of
the
colloquy
that
he
knew
they
were
still
in
town
because
there
was
a
religious
event,
and
counsel
provided
the
actual
address
of
the
relative's
house,
at
which
were
believed
to
be
staying,
and
told
the
trial
court
judge
that
they
had
no
telephone
there,
which
is
why
the
girlfriend
had
gone
out
looking
for
them.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
the--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
record
doesn't
establish
for
sure
where
it
is
that
they
went
at
the
time
they
left
or
for
a
fact
that
they
could
have
been
brought
in.
again,
i...
i
don't
think
that
that's
necessary
to
the
ruling
because
it's
evaluated
at
the
time
of
the
trial
court's
denial.
but
if
the
court
disagrees,
it
could
remand
this
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
engage
in
more
fact-finding
about
what
the
witnesses
did.
the
lower
courts
never
got
that
far.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
contradicts
the
representations
made
by
counsel
and
the
defendant
to
the
state
trial
court
that
they
were
staying
at
a
relative's
house
and
that
they
were
still
in
town,
and
the
state
has
never
offered--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--well,
counsel's
actual
request
for
a
continuance
was...
was
until
the
following
morning.
and
if
nothing
else,
even
if
counsel
couldn't
have
found
them,
the
state
has
an
obligation--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--correct,
and
then
it's...
and
then--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--but
then...
but
ultimately
counsel
asked
for
an
overnight
continuance.
and
that's
when
the
whole
exchange
with
the
judge
takes
place
where
the
judge
says,
oh,
friday
i'm
going
to
be
with
my
daughter
in
the
hospital.
then
the
lawyer
says,
well,
what
about
monday,
and
the
trial
judge's
response
is,
i
have
another
trial
scheduled.
so,
that's
where
that
whole
exchange
takes
place.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
correct.
and
the
sheriff's
office
could
have
gone
out.
counsel
also
asked
for
arrest
warrants...
he
called
them
capiases...
arrest
warrants
to
go
out
to
find
the
witnesses,
if
necessary,
if
he
couldn't
have
located
them.
and
that's...
that's
the
least
that
the
due
process
clause
and
the
compulsory
process
clause
would
require,
would
be
some
effort
to
try...
to
try
to
bring
in
the
witnesses--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--you
know,
i
think
that
is
a
backup
suggestion
by
counsel
to
cover
all
bases.
they
were
under
subpoena.
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
have
witnesses
under
subpoena
there.
they
had
mysteriously
disappeared.
he
had
no
idea
why
they
left
or
where
they
had
gone.
and
he
was
covering
all
of
his
bases
by
asking
the
trial
court
for
arrest
warrants,
if
necessary.
it
may
never
have
come
to
that
because
the
girlfriend
wasn't
even
given
enough
time
to
get
to
the
relative's
house
to
see
if
they
were
there.
and
just
returning
also
to
the
circumstances
in
which
this
exchange
took
place,
the
trial
court
had
created
a
real
sense
of
rush
and
urgency
in
this
trial.
i've
quoted
several
instances
in
the
opening
brief.
it's
footnote
9
where
the
state
trial
court
had
indicated
to
counsel
that
he
wanted
to
move
this
case
along.
just
before
the
lunch
recess,
in
fact,
he
said,
i
want
this
courtroom
cleared
by
2:00
p.m.
and
that's
trial
transcript
page
570.
i
want
this
courtroom
cleared
by
2:00
p.m.--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--no.
[laughter]
no.
and
i'm
not
saying
that
the...
the
trial
court
doesn't
have
broad
discretion
in
how
to
manage
its
docket
and
everything
else.
but
when
counsel
was
before
the
judge
and
is
explaining
the
situation
that
has
occurred,
the
atmospherics
that
had
arisen
where
the
trial
court
judge
is
pressuring
them
to
move
along
factor
into
how
the
colloquy
went,
especially
given
that
this
is
an
unexpected
situation.
it's
not
that
different
from
what
happened
in
osborne
v.
ohio,
although
i
think
that
case
is
less
compelling
than
ours
because
there
was
no
emergency
situation.
but
in
osborne
v.
ohio,
ohio
had
a
rule
requiring
that
jury...
that
objections
to
jury
instructions
be
made
right
before
they're
delivered.
counsel
didn't
object
to
the
lack
of
an
instruction
on
lewdness,
but
this
court
said
that
the
pretrial
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
first
amendment
grounds
was
sufficient
and--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--well,
the
basic
principles
regarding
when
a
state
law
ground
is
adequate
haven't
changed
much.
this
court
takes
a
functional
approach
to
looking
both
to
whether
or
not
a
litigant
has
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
preserve
his
claim
and
also
to
whether
anything
would
be
gained
whether
all
of
the
purposes
served
by
the
rules
have
been
fulfilled,
such
that
there's
some
adequate
state
interest
in
enforcing
a
procedural
default.
the
purpose
of
these
rules
is
to
permit
the
trial
court
to
pass
on
the
merits
of
a
motion
for
a
continuance.
the
trial
court
denied
this
motion
on
the
merits,
and
we
quarrel
with
the
basis
for
the
trial
court's
denial.
we
think
it
was
as
arbitrary
as
arbitrary
can
be.
but
there's
no
mystery
here
was
to
why
the
trial
court
ultimately
denied
that
request
and
it
wasn't
because
of
any
procedural
defect
in
that
motion.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
correct.
and...
and
there's...
there's
something
anomalous
about
an
appellate
court
coming
in
to
enforce
a
procedural
rule,
in
circumstances
where
there's
an
emergency
situation,
such
that
neither
the
trial
court,
the
prosecutor,
or
the
defendant
believed
that
there
was
anything
more
that
needed
to
be
done.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
the
only
thing
that
could
possibly
be
missing
in
the
showing
that
was
made
during
the
exchange
on
the
continuance
was
a
failure
to
repeat
the
full
opening
statement
regarding
what
the
witnesses
would
have
testified
to.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
what
rule
24--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--rule
24.10(b)
requires
the
name
and
address--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--i'm
reading
from
page
3a
of
the...
the
appendix
to
the
opening
brief.
it
requires
the
name
and
residence
of
such
witness,
if
known...
that
was
given...
and
also
facts
showing
reasonable
grounds
for
belief
that
the
attendance
or
testimony
of
such
witness
will
be
procured
within
a
reasonable
time.
the
showing
that
was
made
to
the
trial
court
during
the
discussion
was
both
that
they
were
still
in
kansas
city,
missouri.
they
hadn't
left
for
california,
and
that
they
had
reason
to
believe
they
were
still
there
because
they
had
a
religious
event
to
attend.
if
he
had
written
out
of
amotion,
he
couldn't
possibly
have
said
more.
that
is
a
sufficient
showing
under
that
ground.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
and--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--that's
correct.
they
were
subpoenaed
in
counsel's
office
when
he
was
interviewing
them.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
but
we
don't--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--no,
because
there
was
no
factual
basis
at
that
moment
before
the
state
trial
court
judge
to
have
any
idea
whether
it
was
a
medical
emergency,
a
misunderstanding,
they
had
gone
to
lunch
and
hadn't
come
back
on
time.
there
was
no
information
before
the
state
trial
court
at
that
moment
to
form
any
assumption
about
why
they
left.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
correct.
they
were
in
a
separate
witness
room,
and
during
the
time
that
they
supposedly
left,
there
were
trial
proceedings
that
were
going
on.
there
was...
they
were
in
trial
with
witnesses
at
the
point
that
they...
that
the
witnesses
left.
so,
there
wouldn't
have
been
contact.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
well,
if
you
credit
the
later
story--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--you
have
witnesses
who
apparently
are
unsophisticated.
they're
not
lawyers.
they're
not
schooled
in
the
law,
and
if
you
credit
their
story
that
someone
told
them
their
testimony
wasn't
needed
that
day
and
they
could
leave--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--correct.
he
had...
he
was
a
minister
and
he
had
a
religious
event
in
kansas
city
that
day
and
the
next,
which
was
the
reason
that
was
given
for
believing
that
they
were
still
in
town.
no
one
made
any
effort
to
track
these
witnesses
down
or
to
enforce
the
subpoena.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
correct?
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
correct,
correct.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
it
actually
makes
the
trial
court's
decision
that
much
more
arbitrary
because
at
the
moment
that
the
trial
court
is
faced
with
this
question,
you
have
witnesses
who
traveled
voluntary
from
california,
who
are
under
subpoena,
who
actually
appeared
in
the
courthouse,
were
sitting
in
a
witness
room,
and
had
suddenly
disappeared,
and
no
one
knew
why.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
well,
with
respect
to
your
question
regarding
the
delay,
i
think
that's
just
a
function
of
how
the
missouri
post-conviction
process
unfolded.
he...
you
know,
he
filed
a...
a
motion
for
post-conviction
relief
later
in
'94.
counsel
was
then
appointed.
counsel
filed
an
amended
petition,
and
so
you
had
the
passage
of
time.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
i
don't
know
whether
he
got
in
touch
with
them
or
not.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
the
record--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
record--
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
--the
record
is
silent
on
that.
i...
i
can't
answer
that.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
yes,
it
was
and
in
fact,
he
was
relieved
during
the
sentencing
hearing
that
took
place.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
correct.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
that
is
an
impression
that
the
record
gives.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
i
don't
know.
getting
back...
just
to
return
to
the
second...
to
this
court's
cases
because
i
think
i
was
beginning
to
get
into
osborne.
i
think
that
osborne
supports
our
position
here
because
the
court
took
a
functional
approach
in
osborne
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any...
anything
that
would
be
gained
by
forcing
counsel
to
repeat
information
that
was
already
before
the
judge,
and
the
court
said,
no,
there
was
no...
there
was
no
default.
other
cases
in
which
this
court
has
found
that
procedural
rules
were
applied
with
the
phrase
being
pointless
severity
or
whether
there
were
arid
rituals
of
meaningless
form
where
technical
niceties
were
not
observed,
but
nonetheless
counsel
could
substantially
comply
with
the
showings
required
by
the
rules,
cases
like
douglas
v.
alabama
where
you
didn't
repeat
a
futile
objection,
cases
like
staub
v.
city
of
baxley
where
counsel
challenged
on
first
amendment
grounds
an
entire
ordinance
and
didn't
signal
out
particular...
particular
provisions
to...
to
attack
because
it
was
clear
what
the...
what
the
lawyer
was
challenging.
wright
v.
georgia
and
naacp
v.
alabama
ex
rel.
flowers
where
the
claims
weren't
grouped
exactly
right
in
the...
in
the
state
court
appeal,
but
this
court,
nonetheless,
found
that
no
purpose
would
be
served
by
finding
a
default
in
those
cases.
all
of
those
suggest...
and...
and
also
the
fact,
of
course,
that
the
defendant
did
not
have
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
comply
with
the
letter
of
the
rules,
but
nonetheless
substantially
complied
with
the
rules.
all
of
those
suggest
there
should
be
no
default,
and
in
the
alternative,
even
if
there
was
one,
that
there
should
be
a
finding
of
cause
and
prejudice.
and
with
the
court's
permission,
if
there
are
any
more
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
just
a
few
quick
points.
with
respect
to
the
proffer
and
somebody
being
willing
to
put
their
credibility
on
the
line,
the
defendant
actually
took
the
stand
during
the...
the
colloquy
on
the
continuance.
he
was
sworn,
which
actually
you
would
think
is
a
superior
form
of
proof
to
an
affidavit,
and
there
he
was
subject
to
cross-examination
by
the
prosecutor,
if
there
had
been
any
questions.
she
didn't
have
any
other
than
to
clarify
that
the
witnesses
had
been
under
subpoena,
which
they
had
been.
and...
and
so,
i...
i
think
that
the...
that
whole
like
of
inquiry
about
whether
somebody
is
willing
to
sort
of
swear
to
facts
in
support
of
the
motion
sort
of
falls
by
the
wayside
because
he
was
on
the
stand.
in
addition,
in
terms
of
what...
what
all
the
players
in
the
sea
knew
about...
about
these
witnesses,
there's
a
rule.
it's
rule
25.05
of
the
missouri
rules
that
requires
a
notice
of
an
alibi
to
be
given.
apparently
one
was
given
because
the
prosecutor
came
prepared
in
her
opening
statement
to
address
briefly
the
fact
that
there
was
an
alibi
defense
that
she
expected
to
be
presented.
and
in
addition,
the
detectives
interviewed
these
witnesses
while
they
were
in
kansas
city
and
took
statements
from
them,
and
if
there
was
any
question
later,
as
the
record
developed
further
in
federal
court,
about
whether
these
witnesses
really
would
have
said
what...
what
they
said
they
were
going
to
say,
the
state
had
whatever
notes
or
statements
that
was
taken
from
the
interviews
that
were
done
with
these
witnesses.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
at
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
defendant
argued
the
denial
of
the
brief
continuance
and
the
denial
of
the
arrest
warrant
to
enforce
the
subpoenas...
argued
that
that
denied
the
defendant
a
fair
trial.
due
process
clause
was
specifically
mentioned
in
the
post-conviction
motion
and
on
appeal
in
the
missouri
court
of
appeals.
ms.
bonnie
i.
robin-vergeer
actually,
it...
it
was
both.
in
the
amended
post-conviction
motion
and...
and
the
relevant
passage
is
on
page
56
of
the
joint
appendix
and
it
continues
through
page
58...
the
defendant
specifically
argued
that
movant
was
denied
his
rights
to
due
process
of
law
and
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
when...
and
then
it
sort
of
recites,
and
it...
and
it
goes
along
and
says...
and
talks
about,
a,
the
fact
that
someone
told
the
witnesses
to
leave
and,
b,
that
the
trial
court
overruled
the...
the
defense
motion
for
a
continuance.
so...
so,
the
due
process
clause
is...
is
explicitly
stated
there
and...
and
thereafter.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
