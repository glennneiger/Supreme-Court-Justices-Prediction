mr.
paul
c.
wilson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
kennedy...
kennedy,
you
are
quite
right
to
be
disturbed
by
counsel's
failure
to
provide
the
court
any
more
information
or
better
showing
under...
under
rule
24.10
in
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
that
was
filed
2
weeks
after
the
events
that
the
court
has
been
discussing
than
he
did.
but
what
should
trouble
this
court
much,
much
more
than
that
is
that
2
months
following
the
last
day
of
petitioner's
trial,
his
new
trial
motion
was
heard,
and
the
trial
court
asked
counsel
whether
he
had
anything
else
that
he
would
like
to
submit
in
consideration
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
and
counsel
replied
no.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
first
of
all,
for...
for
counsel
to
have
represented
the
facts
that
24.10
requires,
counsel
would
have
had
to
believe
that
they
were
true.
and
one
of
the
principal
purposes--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--excuse
me?
i'm--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--the
habeas
court
addressed
the
question
of
whether
there
was
such--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--and
because
they...
they
said
that
claim
was
never
raised
to--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--first,
how
trial
counsel
conducts
trial
motions
and
post-trial
motions
is
an
area
in
which
he...
there
is
a
broad
discretion
for
the
trial
counsel.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
justice
breyer,
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
that
is
not
correct.
first,
these
are
published
rules
of
court
that
were
in
the
book
long
before
petitioner's
trial,
and
the
cases
applying
these
rules,
in
fact,
comparable
to
these
and
in
others,
are...
it's
an
unbroken
string
of
precedent.
so,
counsel
was
either
aware
of
those
or
was
certainly
deemed
to
be
aware
of
those.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
and
second--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--he
didn't
say
because
i
find
that--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--no,
your
honor.
he
did
not
cite
that.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
i
don't
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
i
don't
believe
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
i
don't
believe
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
indicates
that
that
is
why
he
denied
the
motion.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
i...
i
think
the
record
clearly
shows
that
the
reason
he
denied
the
continuance
is
because,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
he
determined,
on
the
circumstances
that
had
been
presented
to
him,
that
these
witnesses
abandoned
the
defense.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
the...
the
continuance
that
was
requested
was
till
the
following
morning,
and
it
was
in
that
context...
and...
and
it
is
a
single
sentence
utterance
there,
that...
that
he
noted
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
in
the
courthouse--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--the
trial
judge
could
have
been
responding
to
the
idea
that
even
though
you've
not
made
a
sufficient
showing,
i'm
not
going
to
cut
a
break
for
this
because--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--he
found
that
an
insufficient
showing
had
been
made,
and
there
are
other
factors
that
he
would
have
been
considering.
first,
counsel
had
committed
to
this
trial
schedule.
second,
defense
counsel
had
announced
himself
ready
to
proceed
and
had
put
on
part
of
his
case.
third--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--except
that
the
circumstances
that
were
presented
to
the
trial
court,
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
supported
his
conclusion
that
they
had
left--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--there
was
a
court
employee
in
contact
with
them
and
also
trial
counsel
was
in
contact
with
them
and
the
defendant.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
but
trial
counsel
went
and
checked
on
them
at
10
o'clock
when
the
state
rested
its
case.
he
was
back
one
subsequent
time
i
believe
the
record
shows.
but
at
least
he
says
in
the
new
trial
motion...
he
says
with
clarity
and
particularity
that
he
went
there
at
11
o'clock
and
they
were
gone.
so,
from
the
time
he
knew
that
they
were
gone,
2
hours
elapsed
before
they
were
back
in
front
of
the
trial
court.
and
it
is
important
to
note
that
the...
the
colloquy
that
occurs.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
but
if
these
are
the
witnesses
that
stand
between
this
young
man
and
life
in
prison
without
parole,
it
is
absolutely
to
be
presumed
that
trial
counsel
did
what
trial
counsel
would
do
in
that
circumstance
and
say,
you
are
under
subpoena.
you
don't
leave
this
courtroom
unless
i
tell
you...
you
don't
leave
the
courthouse
unless
i
tell
you
it
is
okay.
our
case
is
now
beginning.
it
will
proceed--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--justice
ginsburg,
he
may
not
have
believed
that
they
would
leave
or...
or
suspected
they
might
leave,
but
these
are
the
sorts
of
instructions
that
trial
counsel
give
their
witnesses
whether
or
not
they
think
that
that
might
happen
because
the
circumstances
can
be
very
dire
if
they
do
leave.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
first,
the
judge
did
ask,
following
the
discussion
about
what
had
happened,
whether
counsel
intended
to
file
a
motion
for
a
continuance.
it
seems
clear
in
that
that
he
expected
or
at
least
had
reason
to
believe
that
counsel
would
be
providing
a
writing.
second,
this
trial
judge
was
a
very
well-respected
court
of
appeals
judge
in
the
state
of
missouri,
and
in
fact
he
sat
on
the
panel
that
decided
state
v.
settle,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
which
was
a
case
that
determined
that
a
showing...
where
the
24.10
showing
was
not
made,
either
by
affidavit,
but
also
by
substance,
that
the
motion...
that
the
denial
of
the
motion
could
be
affirmed
on
that
basis
alone.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
i
don't
know
any
of
the
dozens
of
missouri
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
briefs
that
applied
the
rule
that
a
failure
to
comply
with
those
rules
will
foreclose
appellate
review
where
they
cited
that
the
trial
judge
had
made
a
specific
finding
24.09
has
been
or
24.10
has
been
violated.
instead,
that's
the...
the
review
that
the
appellate
court
undertook.
second--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--justice
breyer--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--the
standard
that
you
gave
me,
justice
breyer,
i
don't
believe
differs
materially
from
the
standard
in
ford
v.
georgia
which
is
firmly
established
and
regularly
applied.
it's
important
to
note
that
regularly
applied
does
not
mean
precisely
applied
to
these
exact
circumstances
in
a
published
case
prior
to
the
defendant's
trial,
but
rather
regularly...
regularly
enforced.
and
so,
i
believe
that
the
standard
you
articulate
is
a
good
one,
and
this
rule
meets
it
because,
a,
it's
published,
and
b,
there
were
an...
an
unbroken
string
of
precedents
both
before
defendant's
trial
and
since
that
time,
and
not
one
of
them
excuses
a
default
under
24.09
or
24.10,
reaches
the
merits
of
a
request
for
a
continuance,
and
finds
that
the
denial
was
error.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
surprise,
justice
breyer,
was
not
present.
he
went
to
the
witness
room
at
11
o'clock
in
the
morning
before
the
lunch
break,
substantially
before
the
lunch
break,
and
discovered
that
they
had
left.
from
11
o'clock
then
until
just
after
1
o'clock
is
the
amount
of
time
he
had
to
conduct
his
investigation
as
to
where
they
had
gone,
but
also
to
prepare
a
writing.
but
leave
aside
the
writing
requirement,
which
may
or
may
not
have
operated
with
any
purpose
in
this
situation...
i
believe
that
it
did.
but
more
importantly,
he
did
not
gather
the
information
and
present
it
all
at
once
to
the
judge
that
24.10
requires.
second--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--he
did
not
tell
the
judge
that
these
witnesses
could
be
located
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
and
that
they
would
give
the
testimony
that
it
has
been
suggested
they
would
give.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
i...
i
do
question
that,
justice
stevens.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
the...
the...
a
lawyer's
statements
and
opening
statement
are
not
evidence
and
they're
not
evidentiary.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
he
did
hear
the
statement,
but
what's--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--but
24.10
requires
more
than
that,
justice
stevens.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
i
do,
but...
but
it
requires
someone
to
attach
their
credibility
to
the
proposition
that
they
will
actually
give
that
testimony.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
your
honor,
that
might
be
true
as
a
general
proposition,
but
we
don't
need
to
rely
on
a
general
proposition
in
this
case
because
this
judge
told
these
lawyers
in
this
lawsuit
the
following.
quote:
i
don't
have
a
lot
of
faith
in
what's
said
in
opening
statements
anyway.
that's
the
trial--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--the
judge
knew
that
he
did
not
have
anybody
in
that
courtroom
who
was
willing
to
stand
up
and
say
on
my
credibility,
that's
what
these
witnesses--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--or
any
other--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--that's
correct.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
i
believe
that
the...
that
the
judge
knew
what
had
been
said...
what
had
been
attributed
to
them
in
the
opening
statement.
i...
that
is
not
the
test
that
24.10
requires.
that's
not
the--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--at
the
most--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--yes.
at
the
most
what
he
knew
was
counsel
expected
that
to
be
their
testimony
the
day
of--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--no,
i
don't
believe
that
that's
correct.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
what
you
can
say
his
statement
and
opening
statement
means.
i
think
that
it
means
that
standing
there...
at...
at
the
most,
what
you
could
say
is,
standing
there
in
front
of
the
jury...
and
he's
addressing
the
jury
and
not
the
judge...
that
his
best
expectation
of
the
best
the
evidence
will
be
out
of
the
witnesses'
mouths
is
as
he
stated
it.
i
don't--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--that
is
what
he
told
the
jury.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
yes.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
but
counsel's
statements
to
the
jury
in
opening
statement
are
not
held
to
the
level
of
a
representation
of
an
officer
of
the
court
to
the
judge--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--the
judge
knew
facts...
knew
those
facts
from
the
opening
statement
only.
but
24.10
requires
someone
to
attach
their
credibility
to
those
propositions
when
they
are
asserted
as
the
basis
for
an
interruption
in
the
orderly
conduct
of
a
criminal
trial.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
that...
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
does
happen.
and
i
believe
especially
it
can
happen
in
a
case
such
as
this
one
where
the
defense
counsel
did
not
know
the
strength
of
the
state's
case
as
accurately
as
he
might
have
because
instead
of
the--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--they
had
been
sequestered.
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
i
don't
know
that
they
did
know,
but
i
know
that
they
visited
frequently
with
the
defendant
and
with
defendant's
counsel.
i
don't
know
that
they
did
know.
and...
and
it
isn't
for
us
9
years
later--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--excuse
me?
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
yes,
4
years
later
they
did,
4
years--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--missouri
v.
cuckovich
and
other
cases
cited
in
the...
in
the
dissent
in
the
eighth
circuit
where
he
quite
candidly
categorizes
and
admits
that
missouri
rules
of
24.09
and
24.10
applied
prior
to
trial,
at
the
outset
of
trial,
and
during
trial.
they
apply...
they
apply--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--your
honor,
i
am
not--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--i'm
not
going
to
stand
on
the
formality,
and
we
didn't
stand
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
formality
of
a
writing
or
even
the
formality
of
an
affidavit.
but
there
was
no
one
in
the
courtroom
at
the
time
this
issue
was
being
decided
who
was
willing
to
attach
their
credibility
to
these
assertions,
who
was
willing
to
say
to
the
judge,
if
you
stop
this
trial,
i
believe
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
i
can
produce
these
witnesses
and
that
they
will
give
this
defendant
an
alibi,
that
they
will
say
on
the
date
and
time
of
this
murder,
he
was
not
within
1,000
miles.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
in
effect,
what
the
lawyer
was
telling
the
judge
by
reference,
implied
or
otherwise,
to
the
entire
body
of
trial
is
not
what
24.09
or
24.10
require.
they
require
that
that
showing
be
made
in
the
application
for
the
continuance.
now,
if
we
say
that
an
oral
application
is
fine,
okay,
but
you
still
have
to
present
the
facts
and
you
have
to
present
them
in
a
way
that
makes
them
believable
because
what's
being
asked
for
is
a
serious
imposition
on
the
trial
court
and
its
conduct
of
this
criminal
trial.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
i
don't
know,
justice
ginsburg.
the
new
trial
motion
was
filed
2
weeks
after
trial,
but
the
new
trial
motion
was
heard
2
months
after
trial.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
justice
ginsburg,
that
argument
in
the
brief
is...
is
not
made
to
show
what
a
reasonable
lawyer
would
do
or
what
every
lawyer
could
do,
but
rather
to
show
that
it
was
neither
impossible
nor
impractical...
impracticable
to
comply
with
the
rule.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
it
may
be
surprising
that...
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
missouri
supreme
court
have
done
that,
but
they
have
done
it.
and
that
is
the
missouri
law
and...
and
it
has
been
so
for
some
time.
and
the
mere
fact--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--well,
the...
no.
the...
the
precise
circumstances
of
this
petitioner's
case
have
not
arisen
in
a
published
case
in
missouri.
that's
correct.
but
there
is...
it
was
clear
that
in
the
midst
trial
and
even
in
some
exigency,
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
missouri
supreme
court
had
held
24.09
and
24.10
to
require
a
writing
and
a
sufficient
showing
in
the
past.
and...
so,
if
this
counsel...
as
soon
as
this
colloquy
was
concluded
and
the
motion
had
been
denied,
they
turned
immediately
to
the...
to
the
petitioner's
counsel's
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
at
the
close
of
all
of
the
evidence.
he
made
that
motion
orally,
but
because
he
knew
that
in
order
to
preserve
his
right
to
appeal
any
of
the
points
therein,
he
asked
the
judge,
and
the
judge
gave
him
permission,
to
file
the
writing
later.
the
same
is
true
with
this
rule.
because
anybody
who
had
read
the
cases
applying
24.09
and
24.10
would
know
that
you
are
forfeiting
your
right
to
appellate
review
of
a
denial
if
you
have
not
put
the
sufficient
showing
before
the
judge
and
done
so
in
writing.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
yes,
that
is
clear.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
yes,
it
is.
24.10...
one
of
the--
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
--yes.
the
purpose
would
be
to
provide
a
meaningful
appellate
review
by
bounding
the
relevant
facts
in
a
credible
fashion
and
presenting
them
not
just
to
the
trial
judge,
but
also
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
no,
i
don't
believe
so
because
the...
the
very
purpose
of
the
appellate
rule
is
that
they
will
not
do
exactly
that.
if
24.09
and
24.10
were
not
complied
with,
then
it
doesn't
really
matter.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe...
i
believe
that
what
is
appealed
from
is
the
decision
and
not
the
reasons
for
the
decision.
mr.
paul
c.
wilson
except
that
compliance
with
24.10
doesn't...
doesn't
require
you
to
be
able
to
trace
it
through
the
record,
but
rather
that
you
presented
it
all
at
once
to
the
trial
judge
and
that
you
did
so
with
some
credible
reason
to
believe
that
what
was
being
asserted
was
so.
your
honors,
2...
2
months
after
this...
after
the
denial
of
the
continuance
occurred,
they
appeared
before
this
very
same
trial
judge
to
hear
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
no
explanation
was
given
to
that
judge.
no
better
or
further
showing
was
provided.
even
the
simplest
fact
like
the...
like
that
they
were
available
and
able
to
testify
the
very
next
day
in
kansas
city
was
not
offered
to
this
trial
judge.
there
was
no
due
process
claim
before
this
trial
judge
either
at
trial
or
on
the
motion
for
new
trial,
and
he
had
no
facts
to
believe
that
he
had
done
anything
other
than
what
was
fundamentally
fair
under
that
circumstance
on
the
circumstances
as
they
had
been
presented
to
him
in
the
context
of
the
motion
for
a
continuance.
thank
you.
