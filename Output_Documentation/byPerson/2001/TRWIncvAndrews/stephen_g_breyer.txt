justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
to
a
person,
if
you're
right,
who
finds
out
3
years...
3
years
later
she's
denied
credit,
and
the
reason
was
because
3
years
ago
the
company
sears
got
a
report
that
had
all
kinds
of
incorrect
information
in
it
or
whatever?
is
that
person
without
any
remedy
totally?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
happens
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--let's
suppose--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--she...
in
year
1
you
do
a
credit
report.
you
have
19
things
you're
not
supposed
to
disclose:
old
arrest
records,
old
bankruptcy
records.
you
do
everything
wrong.
all
right.
you
send
it
off
to
sears.
she
doesn't
actually
apply
until
year
8
to
get
credit
from
sears.
sears
goes
to
its
files,
looks
up
this
old
report,
says
no
credit.
now,
does
she
have
any
remedy
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
she
can
sue
who?
she
can
sue
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
your...
your
client
deals
with
sears
in
year
1.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
year
1
and
they
never
see
sears
again.
in
year
8,
the
credit
is
denied.
is
there
any
remedy
for
the
person
who
was
denied
the
credit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
reason
that
i
think
i'm
having
such
difficulty
with
it
is
because
on
your
theory,
the
statute
doesn't
begin
to
run
till
discovery
anyway.
so,
you
have
to
imagine
a
case
where
the
only
way...
the
thing
didn't
begin
till
discovery.
then
this
proviso
is
supposed
to
be
doing
some
work?
what
could
it
be?
i
mean,
it
seems
you
have
to
think
of
very
weird
cases,
very
unusual
cases
before
you
could
imagine
a
situation
where
the
proviso
would
serve
any
function
at
all
on
your
theory,
which
is
it
doesn't
run
till
discovery
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that,
of
course,
is
true,
but
it's
very
hard
to
see
how
a...
a
deception
could
be
a
material
deception
where
the
person
is
fully
aware
of
the
underlying
liability.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
and
if
he
is
not
fully
aware
on
your
theory,
the
underlying
statute
didn't
begin
to
run.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
strike
full
aware.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
looking
for
the
example
on
your
theory
of
the
case
and
at
the
heart
of
the
statute
which
has
to
do
primarily
with
two
things.
you've
got
to
have
reasonable
procedures,
et
cetera,
when
you
have
your
agency,
and
then
in
the
few
cases,
comparatively,
where
somebody
wants
the
information
about
them,
you
have
to
give
it
to
them.
okay?
that's
basically
what
it's
about.
that
heartland
of
the
statute
on
your
theory...
it's
hard
for
me
to
find
examples
that
would
be
significant
in
number
where
this
proviso
would
be
doing
any
work.
now,
that's
my
problem,
and
you
can
respond
to
that
by
giving
me
obvious
examples
where
it
would
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
you
just
swallowed...
the
words
you
just
swallowed
are
my
problem.
if
those
misrepresentations
were
material,
then
she
wouldn't
have
discovered
the
underlying
harm
anyway.
so,
you
wouldn't
have
needed
the
proviso
on
your
theory
of
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
those
were
the
examples
i
was
looking
for.
you
see?
that...
you
put
your
finger
right
on
where
i'm
having
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i
mean,
the...
i
still
don't
see
it.
maybe
you
need
an
example.
my
simpleminded
thinking
of
it
is
the
consumer...
the
credit
people
make
a
misrepresentation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
the
consumer
and
it's
either
material
or
it
isn't.
if
it
is
material,
that
must
be
because,
at
least
in
most
cases,
it's
hidden,
some
fact
that
is
relevant
to
showing
liability,
in
which
case
you
don't
need
the
special
exception
because
the
person
didn't
know
all
the
facts.
they
hadn't
discovered
it.
or
it's
not
material,
in
which
case
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
exception
anyway.
now,
that's
my
simpleminded
thought,
and
what
i
started
with
and
i
think
i'll
continue
with
is
you
produce
an
example
that
proves
my
simpleminded
thought
is
simplemindedly
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
because
the
question
is
simply
this.
imagine
there
were
no
proviso.
think
of
the
example
you
just
gave.
are
you
going
to
admit
on
your
theory
that
the
statute
began
to
run
against
your
consumer,
or
are
you
going
to
say,
of
course,
it
didn't
run?
he
didn't
discover
what
was
going
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
are
you
going
to
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
difficulty...
the
difficulty
i'm
having
with
that,
though
i
see
that
now,
is
basically
what
you've
done
there
is
you've
taken
a
statute
that
doesn't
discuss
any
of
these
things,
and
you
take
what
would
be
a
full
discovery
rule,
and
then
you
break
it
into
bits.
now,
you
say...
you
say,
well,
we're
taking
a
bit
out
of
it
and
that's
the
work
that
the
proviso
will
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
a
little
nervous.
perhaps
congress...
i
don't
know
if
i
would
have
written
the
statute
this
way,
but
i
assume
that
the
credit
companies
were
arguing,
look,
if
you
have
a
discovery
rule
here
across
the
board,
even
discovery
injury,
what
will
happen
is
45
million
americans
who
never
ask
for
their
report,
2
million
do.
all
right?
20
years
later,
it
turns
out
that
we
used
an
unreasonable
procedure
20
years
ago.
and
lawyers
for
the
45
million
others
will
start
combing
the
records
to
find
out
how
there
was
an
invasion
of
privacy
or
some
other
injury,
and
before
you
know
it,
will
proliferate
lawsuits
about
things
that
happened
20
or
30
years
ago
and
created
only
minor
injuries
that
people
didn't
even
know
about
then.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they...
they
don't
know.
they
don't
know
who
was...
you
know,
there's
no
way
to
know
if
it
was
an
unreasonable
procedure,
who
was
told
what.
