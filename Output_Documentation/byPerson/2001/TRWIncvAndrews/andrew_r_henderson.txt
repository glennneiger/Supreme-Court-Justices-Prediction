mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
looking
at
the
statute
at
issue,
there
are
two
parts
to
it.
the
first
part
is
the
main
part
that
provides
that
under
the
fair
credit
reporting
act,
the
2-year
limitation
begins
when
liability
arises.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
that...
that
is
the
rule
that's
been
adopted
by
many
circuit
courts
of
appeal
around
the
country,
in
cada
and
in
the
connors
case.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
i
don't
know
that
it's
the
rule
of
this
court.
that's
what
we're
here
to
answer
today
in
part.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
holmberg--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--that's
correct,
and
i...
and
i'm
not
here
to
defend
the
articulation
of
the
judgment
by
the
ninth
circuit.
i...
i
believe
that
the
judgment
was
correct,
but
for
reasons
that
can
be
much
better
explained.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
thank
you.
and
there
are
the
two
parts.
the
first
part
is
the
liability
arises
language,
which
generally
applies--
the
second
part
is
an
estoppel
provision,
and
a
very
liberal
one
at
that,
in
that
it
calls
for
a
complete
renewal
of
the
limitations
period,
not
merely
suspension,
which
is
the
normal
rule
at
federal
law.
so,
it
is
a
very
liberal
estoppel
provision
enacted
by
congress
that
should
in
no
way
derogate
the
application
of
the
normal
provision,
the
liability
arises
language.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that
when
you
consider
the
misrepresentation
exception,
what...
what
it
is
is
it
is
a
very
additive
provision
that
says
that
if
there
is
an
intervening
misrepresentation
by
a
credit
reporting
agency,
during
the
running
of
a...
of
a
normal
limitations
period,
then
there
is
complete
renewal
upon
discovery
of
that
intervening
misrepresentation,
not
merely
suspension,
which
is
the
normal
federal
rule,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
at
least
members
of
this
court
have
recognized,
for
example,
in
jordan
chardon
v.
soto
in
1983
in
the
dissent.
but
the...
the
fact
that
congress
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
if...
if
this
particular
type
of...
of
egregious
misconduct
arises,
which
is
not
the
normal
misconduct
that
the
statute
is
meant
to
address,
but
this
particular
new
type
of
egregious
misconduct
arises,
then
we're
going
to
have
a
complete
renewal
when
that
is
discovered.
that
really
is
an--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--no.
it
says
that
the...
that
the
limitations
period
shall
begin
from
and
shall
run
from...
for
2
years
from
the
discovery
of
the
misrepresentation.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
it's
shown
on
page
1
of
the
blue
brief,
for
example.
and
it's...
it's
a
very
long
provision
that
takes
up
the
bulk
of
statute
at
issue.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
it...
it
uses
the
word
except,
but
it
is
clearly
an
additive
provision
that...
and
the
odd
thing
about
this
is
that
the
four
courts
of
appeals
that
have
misconstrued
the
statute
in
my
view
have
looked
at
this
and
have
said,
that
which
is
clearly
additive
should
be
read
so
as
to
subtract
from
the
main
provision
in...
in
a
substantial
way.
and
it
makes
no
sense
that
when
congress
intended
to
simply
add
something,
that
is
clearly
for
the
benefit
of
consumers,
and
that
provides
2
full
years
upon
the
discovery
of
an
intervening
deception,
should
how...
somehow
be
read
to
truncate
the
normal
provision.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
justice
breyer,
they
are
discovery
of
two
different
things.
just
as,
for
example,
the
seventh
circuit's
cada
decision,
which
was
written
by
judge
posner,
clearly
makes
a
distinction
between
the
injury
discovery
rule,
which
is
an
accrual
rule,
and
equitable
estoppel,
which...
which
is
used
normally
to
suspend
the
running
of
a
statute
of
limitations
after
it
has
begun,
well,
the
injury
accrual
rule
has
to
do
with
the
discovery
of
the
injury
commencing
the
limitations
period.
equitable
estoppel
has
to
do
with
discovering
the
deception
or
the
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
the--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--fully
aware
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
that...
i
beg
to
differ,
justice
breyer.
it's...
full
awareness
is
the
kind
of
full
awareness
that
the
dissent
in
kubrick
argued
for,
which
is
full
awareness
of
all
the
elements,
including
the
breach
of
the
duty.
we
do
not
argue
that
the
breach
of
the
duty
need
be
discovered--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
gladly,
justice
breyer.
the
best
example
would
be
the
facts
in
this
case,
and
i'll
add
some
facts
to
show
you
how
the
misrepresentation
exception
would
work.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
the
plaintiff's
privacy
was
breached
four
times
between
july
1994
and
january
1995,
and
she
had
no
reason
to
know
that
until
she
went
to
apply
for
credit
in
the
normal
course
of
her
business
in
may
of
1995.
now,
immediately
upon--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--she
had
no
cause
of
action
because
she
had
not
suffered
any
injury
as
a
result
of
these
completely
latent
privacy
breaches,
and
in
fact,
she
could
have
gone
to
her
grave
never
knowing
about
them.
but
because
she
went
out
and
applied
for
credit,
she
found
out
about
them,
and
she
immediately
asked
for
and
received
her...
a
consumer
file
disclosure
from
trw,
the
defendant.
now,
trw,
the
defendant
in
this
case,
did
not
misrepresent
any
facts,
did
not,
for
example,
conceal
those
four
privacy
breaches.
had
they
done
so,
however,
had
they
sent
back
to
here
a
letter,
in
which
they
had
concealed
the
four
privacy
breaches,
then
she
would
still
be
perhaps...
well,
she
might
not
even
be
aware
of
the
injury
at
that
time,
but
she
would
certainly...
the...
the
misrepresentation
exception
at
that
point
in
time
would
be
invoked
if,
in
fact,
the
misrepresentation--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--well,
there
may
be...
there
may
well
be
other
misrepresentations
that
could
be
made
by
a
credit
reporting
agency,
however,
that
was...
that
went
to
the...
their...
that
were
material
to
their
liability,
and
the
fact
that...
that
they
might
not--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--well,
perhaps
they
could
give
a
misrepresentation
to
the
effect
that
the
federal
government
requires
us
to
use
the
procedures
we
use,
and
they've
been
deemed
reasonable
by
the
federal
government
or
in
some
other
way
reasonable--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--as
i
sit
here,
i'm
trying
to
come
up
with
one,
but
i
think
that
any
misrepresentation
by
the
credit
reporting
agency
in
response
to
a
consumer
demand--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--yes.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
no,
i
don't
believe
it's
at
all
superfluous
any
more
than
i
believe
equitable
estoppel
is
superfluous
from
the
injury
discovery
rule.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
well,
i...
i
believe
that,
for
example,
if
a
consumer
were
to
inquire
of
a
credit
reporting
agency
saying
give
me
everything
in
your
file,
which
includes
all
the
credit
accounts,
all
the
disclosures
for
up
to
2
years
for
employment
purposes
and
lesser
amount
of
time
for
other
reasons,
and
if
there
was
any
disclosure
in
there
or
any
representation
in
there
by
the
credit
reporting
agency
that
was
intended
to
deceive
the...
the
consumer
about
the...
about
the
extant
liability,
then
it
could
be,
for
example,
as
i
said,
a...
a...
some
message
from
the
credit
reporting
agency
saying
that
we
are...
we
are
required
by
law
to
have
the
procedures
we
have
or
to
do
that
which
we
did,
which
would
be
a
falsehood
and
intended
to
deceive
the
consumer
from
bringing
a
claim
for...
for...
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
procedures
were,
in
fact,
reasonable.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
how
would
the
consumer
know
that
the
misrepresentation
is--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--it
would
be
a
misrepresentation
about
the
behind-the-scenes
activity
of
the
credit
reporting
agency.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
are
you
talking
about
a
misrepresentation
to
a
user
of
the
credit
report?
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
i
think
you're
confusing
a
misrepresentation
made
to
a
user
of
a
credit
report
from
a
misrepresentation
made
to
the
consumer
who
inquires
of
a
credit
reporting
agency.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
they
should
be
the
same
given...
except
that
there
might
be
differences
in
time.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
they...
that's
the
problem.
that's
what
congress
was
intending
to
address.
the
way
it's
set
up
is
that,
for
example,
if
i
apply
for
credit
and
it's
denied,
the
credit...
the
creditor,
potential
creditor,
is
supposed
to
notify
me
that
it
was
based
on
a
report
from,
for
example,
trw.
i
am
then
put
on
notice--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--exactly.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
to
whom?
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
and
let
me
give
you
one.
for
example,
if
in
the
initial
credit
report
that's
given
out
that
is
erroneous
to
a
user,
there
are
trade
accounts
that
do
not
belong
to
the
consumer,
they
belong
to
someone
else
and
they
are
negative
trade
accounts,
and
yet...
and
on
that
basis
the...
the
user
writes
to
the
consumer
and
says,
you
don't
credit,
we've
got
a
credit
report
from
trw,
and
on
that
basis
we're
denying
your
credit.
so,
the
consumer
turns
to
trw
and
says,
please
give
me
a
credit
report,
and
they
look
at
it
and
they
go,
oh,
there's
all
this
derogatory
information
in
there
that
does
not
belong
to
this
consumer,
let's
get
it
out
of
there
and
give
it
to
the
consumer.
so,
they
take
out
these...
these
trade
lines
that
are
derogatory
and...
and
in
so
doing
misrepresent
information
to
the
consumer
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
material
and
to
deceive
the
consumer
such
that
the
consumer
is
then
misled
about
the
status
of
the
files.
and...
and
presumably
all
this
is
done
with
the
intent
of
deceiving
the--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--i
think
under--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--under
the
injury
discovery
rule
or
the
actual
injury
occurrence
rule,
either
one
which
we
favor,
the
injury
occurs
when
the
credit
is
denied,
and
then
immediately
thereafter
the
consumer
is
put
on
notice.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
and
so,
yes.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
well,
i
think
the...
it's
true
that
the
equitable
estoppel
might
apply
even
if
they
had
not
added
the
misrepresentation
exception,
but
as
members
of
this
court
have
recognized,
for
example,
when...
when
this
court
declined
the
opportunity
to
apply
a
federal
rule
to
class
action
in
civil
rights
cases,
that
the
general
rule
under
federal
law
is
suspension
not
renewal,
which
means
that
normally
you
would
just
toll
the
running
of
the
limitations
period
for
such
amount
of
time
as
there
is...
as
there
is
a
deception
in
place.
however,
congress
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
that's
not
the
rule
here.
we
want
complete
renewal.
we
want
2
full
years
of
unadulterated
knowledge
in
which
to
go
about
considering
whether
to
bring
a
claim.
and
it...
and
it's
odd
to
think
that
the
congress
would
want
that
2
full
years
in
the
situation
where
a...
when
a
misrepresentation
had
sprung
up
but
not
allow
the
same
2
full
years
in
the
normal
case
after
discovery
of
an
injury.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
well,
this
court
in
kubrick
seemed
to
settle
upon
an
injury
and
causation
accrual
rule,
but
i
believe
that--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--based
on
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
has
developed
in
the
courts
of
appeals
in
cada
and
connors,
that
it
is...
injury
alone
is
enough
to
set
the...
to
set
the
plaintiff
on
a
course
of
diligence
towards
the
potential
presentation
of
a
claim.
i
think
obviously
the
injury
and
causation
accrual
rule
is...
is
more
liberal
and
more
fair
in
many
ways.
it's
the
rule
in
germany,
for
example.
but...
but--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--but
if
i
could,
your
honor,
i
want
to
just
talk
also
about
the
actual
injury
occurrence
rule.
in
hyde
v.
hibernia
national
bank
in
1987,
i
believe
it
was,
the
fifth
circuit
looked
at
this
statute
and
said
in
the
case
of
negligence
violations,
you
have
an
actual
injury
occurrence
rule.
in
the
case
of
willful
violations,
you
really
need
to
discover
the
fraud.
it
was
somewhat
of
a...
an
elegant
theory
that...
that
was
derived
by
the
fifth
circuit,
but
it's
been
argued
throughout
this
case
at
all
levels,
in
the
district
court.
in
fact,
in
the
petition
at
page
24a
is
a
discussion
of...
in
the
appendix
at
page
24a
is
a
discussion
of
hyde
v.
hibernia
national
bank.
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
i
don't
believe
so.
if
it
is
an
injury,
it
is
the
most
metaphysical
type
of
injury,
such
as
underground
trespass
where
some
mining
company
burrows
beneath
someone's
land
that
is,
by
its
very
nature,
undiscoverable,
unnoticeable.
and
if
it
is
an
injury,
it
is
so
metaphysical
and
so
unreal
that
it
cries
out
for
the
application
of
the
injury
discovery
rule,
which
by
the
way,
does
not
require
actual
discovery
in
all
cases,
but
can
also
be
invoked
by
constructive
discovery.
and
yet,
where
you
have
an
injury,
if
it
is
an
injury,
of
this
nature
that
is
by
its
nature
undiscoverable,
unnoticeable,
then
of
course,
you
would
have
to
have
the
injury
discovery
rule
at
hand.
i
want
to
also
point
out
that
there
is...
there
was
some
question
about
the
meaning
of
liability
arises.
congress
more
recently
has
indicated
that
the
phrasing...
the
phraseology
used
in
this
statute,
the
liability
arises
language,
is
synonymous
with
accrual
language.
and
i
ask
the
court
to
look
at
49
u.s.c.,
section
32710,
and
the
case
of
carasco
v.
fiori
enterprises,
the
site
for
which
is
985
f.
supp.
931
at
pages
934
through
935.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
recognized
that
when
congress
amended
the
odometer--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--it
is,
and
it...
and
it
analyzes
what
congress
did
with
respect
to
the
odometer--
mr.
andrew
r.
henderson
--thank
you.
