justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
that's
an
argument
that
you
really
save
those
records;
you
shouldn't
throw
them
away.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
talking
about
your
exposure
to
state
cause
of
action
where
they
have
a
discovery
rule
that
your
exposure
runs
beyond
the
2
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
seems
to
me
you
would
have
an
interest
in
keeping
records
that
would
disprove
unmeritorious
claims.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
right,
and
the
question
is
which...
which
is
the
greater
number.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
does
but
still
is
an
exception
from
the
basic
prohibition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
that
you
could
then
get
the
relief
against
sears
doing
the
same
thing
all
over
again?
you
don't
think
you
could
tell
them
to
straighten
out
the
record
for
future
requests?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
haven't
been
injured,
how
can
you
get
the
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
have
to
assume
that
there's
a
violation
for
the
injunction
to
lie.
