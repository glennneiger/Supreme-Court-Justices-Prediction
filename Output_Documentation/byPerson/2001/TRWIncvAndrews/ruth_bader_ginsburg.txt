justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
argument
that
the
plaintiff
isn't
harmed...
the
plaintiff
may
not
be
harmed
by
the
disclosure?
so,
there
may
have
been
a
violation
of
the
statute,
but
no
claim
for
damages,
because
nothing
bad
has
happened
to
the
plaintiff.
so,
you
have
to
wait
until
something
bad
happens
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
liability
for
what,
if
you're
not
damaged?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
would
have
been
sure
about
that
if
the
language
in
the
initial
bill,
which
was
the
date
of
the
occurrence
of
the
violation...
if
that
language
had
been
used.
since
congress
chose
not
to
use
that
language,
which
would
have
been
clear,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
phrase
that
they
did
use,
when
liability
arises,
is
ambiguous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
we
know
it
means
the
same
thing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
other
states
have
changed
the
way
california
has?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
of
the
arguments
you
make,
if
i
remember
correctly,
was
the
ninth
circuit
is...
is
a
large
area,
so
we...
whatever
they
say
is
going
to
govern
for
the
nation
because
we
can't
keep
our
books
one
way
for
california
and
another
way
for
someplace
else.
but
california
is
a
pretty
large
state.
if...
if
you're
saying,
well,
california
has
done
it,
it
doesn't
bother
us,
we
go
our
merry
way,
why
wouldn't
you
do
the
same
thing
under
the
ninth
circuit's
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
then
this...
this...
whether
it's
a
discovery
rule
or
whether
from
the
date
of
the
violation
doesn't
matter,
as
far
as
your
record
keeping
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
statute
of
limitations
i
thought
was
2
years.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
that's
more
than
7
months
or
a
year.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
you
can
say,
we
don't
have
the
records
after
whatever
is...
the...
the
time
periods...
the
statute
of
limitations
is
longer
than
the
required
record
keeping.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
nothing
that
prevents
you
from
keeping
the
records.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we...
we
do
have
a
federal
agency
in
this
picture,
the
ftc.
they
know
something
about
credit.
do
we
owe
them
any
kind
of
respect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you're
not
asking
us
to
say,
no,
there's
no
discovery
rule.
but
what
you're
saying
is
you
can
find
congress
otherwise
intent...
intended
from
something
that's
not
an
express
negation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but
all
that
the
court
must
do
to
hold
in
your
favor
is
to
say
you've
got
an
express
misrepresentation
exception.
then
that's
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
including
the
d.c.
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
this
statute
say
this
during
thing?
it
just...
you
put
a
lot
of
words
into
it,
but
all
that
it
seems
to
say
is
that...
that
if
there's
a
misrepresentation,
the
statute
doesn't
run.
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
don't
we
take
a
look
at
it?
where
is
this
provision
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
henderson,
you
have,
from
i
think
your
answer
to
justice
breyer,
pretty
well
indicated
that
there
would
be,
even
under
your
view,
a
large
overlap
where
you'd
never
get
to
the
misrepresentation
exception
because
the
claim
never
arose
in
your...
in
your
view
of
the
case.
you
stopped
yourself
in
the
middle
of
your
answer
to
him
and
gave
an
answer
that
suggested
that
the
claim
wouldn't
accrue
anyway.
so,
you'd
never
get
to
the
misrepresentation
exception.
and...
and
i
think
that
a
lot
turns
on
that.
so,
i
would
like
you
to
give...
i
have
exactly
the
problem
that
justice
breyer
has.
i
couldn't
think
of
something
that
wouldn't
be
covered
by
your
main
rule,
which
is
nothing...
no
liability
arises
until
the
person
suffers
the
injury,
knows
that
she's
suffered
the
injury.
now,
give
me
an
example
where
she
knows
she
suffered
the
injury
and
would
have
the
benefit
of
the
misrepresentation
exception.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
had
time
when
you
wrote
your
brief
to
think
about
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if...
if
the
misrepresentation
exception
is
superfluous
on
your
reading
of
the
statute,
that
is
a
powerful
reason
for
us
not
to
agree
with
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
give
us
a
concrete
example
where
it
would
have
any
work
to
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
a
credit
theft
and
the
time
allowed
for
brining
suits
under
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
called
by
its
initials
fcra.
the
act’s
time
limitations
provisions
section
1681(p)
contains
a
main
rule
and
an
exception.
generally,
an
action
to
enforce
any
liability
created
under
the
act
must
be
brought
within
two
years
from
the
date
on
which
the
liability
arises.
in
cases
involving
certain
misrepresentations
by
the
credit

company
to
the
person
whose
credit
is
affected
however,
suit
may
be
brought
within
two
years
after
the
plaintiff’s
discovery
of
the
misrepresentation.
the
ninth
circuits
construed
this
entire
provision
and
might
have
a
prescription
that
court
described
as
the
general
federal
rule.
statutes
of
limitations,
the
ninth
circuit
said,
begin
running
upon
the
plaintiff’s
discovery
of
her
injury
here
the
tarnish
on
her
credit,
unless
congress
has
expressly
legislated
otherwise.
accordingly,
that
court
read
section
1681(p)
to
contain
two
discrete
discovery
prescriptions,
a
generally
applicable
implied
discovery
rule
and
in
addition
the
exceptional
discovery
rule
set
out
in
the
statute's
text,
applying
what
it
believed
to
be
the
general
rule,
the
appeals
court
held
timely
all
four
other
fcra
disclosure
claims,
plaintiffrespondent
adelaide
andrews
brought
against
defendantpetitioner
t.r.w.,
inc.
the
ninth
circuit's
sole
rule
even
though
two
of
andrews’
four
claims
were
brought
more
than
two
years
by
close
to
a
month
or
three
after
the
occurrence
of
the
alleged
violation.
those
claims
came
under
the
wire
the
ninth
circuit
said
because
they
were
initiated
less
than
two
years,
in
fact
some
17
months
after,
andrews
discovered
the
asserted
wrongdoing.
we
reversed
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
and
hold
that
a
general
discovery
rule
does
not
govern
section
1681(p).
that
section
explicitly
delineates
the
exceptional
cases
in
which
discovery
figures
the
two-year
limitation
and
andrews
claims
did
not
fall
within
the
exceptional
category.
even
if
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
identified
a
general
presumption
in
favor
of
a
discovery
rule
and
issue,
we
do
not
decide
such
a
presumption
would
not
apply
to
the
fcra
section
1681(p)'s
text
and
structure
our
opinion
explains.
so
that
congress
sought
to
preclude
judicial
implication
of
a
discovery
rule
where
congress
sets
out
particular
exceptions
to
a
general
prohibition
courts
have
no
warrant
to
enlarge
the
exceptions
absent
a
green
light
turned
on
by
the
legislator.
in
this
case,
we
will
distort
1681(p)'s
text
while
we
too
convert
the
explicit
limited
exception
into
a
general
rule.
reading
a
general
discovery
rule
into
section
1681(p),
we
stressed
with
impractical
effect
render
the
expressed
exception
insignificant,
if
not
wholly
superfluous,
that
reading
runs
up
against
the
cardinal
principle
of
statutory
construction.
we
do
not
likely
attribute
to
words
congress
wrote
redundancy
or
trivial
significance.
because
the
issue
was
not
raised
below,
we
do
not
reach
andrews’
alternative
argument
even
if
section
1681(p)
does
not
incorporate
a
general
discovery
rule
she
maintains.
the
liability
does
not
arise
under
the
fcra
when
a
violation
occurs
but
only
on
a
sometimes
later
date
when
actual
damages
materialize.
given
the
complaint
in
this
case,
we
doubt
that
the
argument
even
if
generally
persuasive
would
save
andrews
from
encountering
a
time
bar.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion,
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
