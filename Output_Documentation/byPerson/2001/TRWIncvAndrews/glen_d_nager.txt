mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
statute
of
limitations
on
a
claim
of
improper
disclosure
under
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
does
not
commence
until
the
plaintiff
discovers
her
injury,
as
opposed
to
the...
the
date
of
the
improper
disclosure.
in
doing
so,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
parse
the
language
of
the
statute
of
limitations
that
is
in
the
fair
credit
reporting
act,
but
rather
said
that
language
was
not
sufficiently
expressed
to
overcome
a
presumption
in
favor
of
a
discovery
rule
that
the
ninth
circuit
held
is
read
into
that
statute
and
all
federal
statutes.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the...
the
injury
for
each
alleged
improper
disclosure
would
have
occurred
on
the
date
of
the
alleged
improper
disclosure,
justice
o'connor,
although
some
of
the
damages--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
there
were
four
allegedly
improper
disclosures
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
first
was
in
july
of
1994,
and
when
that
disclosure
was
made,
it
revealed--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--to
the
third
party.
and
the
first
one
here
was
to
a
bank.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
they...
they
might
not
know
about
it,
although
the...
the
way
these
reporting
systems
work,
if
they
ever
actually
apply
for
credit
themselves
and
they're
denied,
they
will
automatically
know
about
it,
which
of
course
is
what
happened
to
the
respondent
in
this
case.
she
didn't
know
about
the--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that's
correct,
and
the
statute
expressly
states
that
the
action
must
be
filed
within
2
years
of
the
date
upon
which
liability
arises.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it
does
have
private
causes
of
action.
the
federal
trade
commission,
of
course,
also
has
authority
to
enforce
the
statute
through
cease
and
desist
orders,
through
civil
penalties--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--absolutely,
justice
o'connor.
we
don't
dispute
that.
but
what
is
does
envision
is
private
enforcement
within
2
years
of
the
date
of
disclosures.
that's
what
the
statute
expressly
says
on
its
face.
it
says
the
action
can
be
brought,
but
if
it's
going
to
be
brought,
it
has
to
be
brought
within
2
years
from
the
date
upon
which
liability
arises.
and
in
plain
english,
as
well
as
under
the
terms
of
this
statute,
if
there
is
liability,
it
arises
upon
the
date
of
the
improper
disclosure.
we
know
that
in
plain
english,
the
term
arise
means
come
into
existence,
originate.
and
we
know
under
this
statute,
section
616
and
617,
which
specify
what
a
defendant's
liability
can
be,
the
statute
equates
liability
with
a
failure
of
a
defendant
to
comply
with
a
requirement
of
the
section.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
statute
says,
justice
ginsburg.
the
statute
says
that
liability
arises
upon
an
improper
disclosure.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff
sought
injunctive
relief,
punitive
damages,
and
actual
damages,
as
well
as,
if
they
prevailed
at
trial,
for
attorney's
fees.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
it's
unclear
under
statute
whether
you
can
get
nominal
damages.
certainly
the
statute
expressly
states
that
in
the
case
of
an
alleged,
willful
violation
of
the
statute,
which
is
what
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
alleged,
you
can
get
punitive
damages.
and
the
case
law
also
allows
for
a
plaintiff
to
seek
injunctive
relief.
let
me
clarify
what
the
injury
is,
justice
ginsburg.
maybe
this
will
assist
both
you
and
justice
o'connor.
what
this
statute
does
is...
the
credit
reporting
companies
have
computer
databases
that
compile
information
about
credit
reporting
histories
of
individuals.
and
it
makes
that
database
available
to
subscribers,
banks,
insurance
companies,
and
the
like.
and
a
creditor
can
go
onto
that
database,
just
like
your
law
clerks
can
go
on
westlaw,
and
pull
off
information.
and
when
they
pull
that
information
off,
if
there
weren't
reasonable
procedures
in
place
to
prevent
them
from
improperly
pulling
information
off,
that
would
be
an
improper
disclosure,
which
would
injure
the
person
because
it
would
invade
their
privacy
and
reveal
confidential
information
about
themselves.
under
state
law,
they
possibly
would
have
a
claim
for
invasion
of
privacy,
or
if
there
was
inaccurate
information
in
the
database,
for
defamation
of
character.
what
this
statute
did
was
it
created
a
federal
right
against
improper
disclosure
in
the
absence
of
reasonable
procedures
of
people's
credit
history.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
don't
know--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i
don't--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--at
the
time
of
enactment
of
this
statute,
the...
the
statutes
of
limitations
of
which
i'm
aware
of
at
state
law,
ran
from
the
date
of
the...
of
the
disclosure,
not
from
the
date
of
discovery.
that
was
typical
in
the
1969-1970
time
frame
for
invasion
of
privacy
claims
and
for
defamation
claims.
and
we
also
know
that
this
statute
is
one
of
six
titles
of
the
consumer
credit
protection
act,
and
we
know
that
each
of
the
statutes
of
limitations
in
those
other
five
titles
run
from
the
date
of
alleged
violation.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i
understand
the...
the
point,
justice
ginsburg,
but
let
me
make
the
case
for
why
that's
not
a
correct
conclusion
to
draw
from
the
premise.
it
obviously
would
have
been
simpler
if
they
had
used
the
language
from
the
date
of
violation,
but
they
used
a
phrase
that
means
the
same
thing.
and
when
they
made
the
change--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--we
know
it
means
the
same
thing
because
every
time
this
court
has
had
a
case
that
has
used
the
term
arise,
it
has
said
that
means
the
date
upon
which
the
event
happens,
not
the
date
upon
which
someone
discovers
it
later.
and
we
know
in
section
616
and
617
of
this
statute
that
liability
is
defined
by
reference
to
the
acts
of
the
defendant.
and
we
also
know
that
there
is
an
explicit
exception
in
section
618,
the
statute
of
limitations
provision,
which
does
expressly
refer
to
a
discovery
rule,
but
it
says
the
discovery
rule
is
applied
in
the
case
of
a
willful
and
material
misrepresentation
of
a
disclosure
required
by
the
statute.
and
the
strong
implication
from
the
inclusion
of
an
express
reference
to
the
discovery
rule
and
the
exception
is
that
the
general
rule
doesn't
include
a
discovery.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
you're
absolutely
right.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the...
the
other
cases
that
the
court
have
said
cause
of
action
arises.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no,
i
don't.
and
i...
i
would
point
you
to
the
court's
decision
in
the
bay
area
laundry
case,
which
was
dealing
with
the
multi-employer
pension
plan
amendments
act.
that
statute,
like
that
statute,
although
it
used
the
phrase,
cause
of
action
arise,
had
a
6-year
limitation
period
from
the
date
the
cause
of
action
arose
or,
alternatively,
3
years
from
the
date
of
discovery
of
the
cause
of
action.
and
this
court,
looking
at
the
primary
statute
of
limitations
provision,
said
that
reflects
the
standard
rule
of
statute
of
limitations
law,
that
the
statute
of
limitations
commences
when
the
cause
of
action
is
complete,
not
upon
discovery.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes,
justice--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that
is
correct.
the
court
can
also
assume,
since
these
are
the
allegations
in
this
case,
for
purposes
of
considering
this
issue,
you
could
consider
that
the
failure
to
maintain
procedures
was
in
fact
intentional
because
they've,
in
fact,
proceeded
under
the...
under
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
prohibits
intentional
noncompliance
with
the
statute
because
they've
alleged
a
right
to
punitive
damages
and
an
intentional
noncompliance
with
the
ninth
circuit
remanding
this
case
to
the...
to
the
trial
courts.
the
claim
is
not
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
they
should
have
the
right
to
proceed
on
their
allegations,
including
their
claim
for
punitive
damages.
so,
you
could
consider
under
either
section
of
the
statute.
we
would
say,
as
they
themselves
conceded
in
their
briefs
to
the
ninth
circuit,
they
said
mrs.
andrews
was
per
se
damaged
when
her
privacy
was
invaded
by
the
disclosures.
now,
they've
made
an
actual
damages
argument
in
this
court.
that's
not
the
argument
they
were
making
in
the
court
below.
what
they
were
saying
in
the
court
below
is
what
would
be
assumed
from
their
complaint
and
would
have
been
assumed
in
any
action
at
common
law
where
someone
was
alleging
invasion
of
privacy
or
defamation,
that
their
injury
occurred
upon
the
date
of
the
alleged
improper
disclosure,
although
they
may
have
suffered
some
additional
damages
or
more
damages
or
all
of
their
damages
at
a
later
point
in
time.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
for
purposes--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that
is
correct.
let...
let
me
move
for
a
second
and...
and
explain
why
the
ninth
circuit's
importation
of
a
discovery
rule
into
this
statutory
scheme
makes
little
sense.
it's
in
the
nature
of
this
statutory
scheme
and
the
subject
matter
that
it's
dealing
with
that
the
claims
that
this
statute
can
give
rise
to
become
stale
very
quickly.
the
reason
is,
is
all
of
the
information
that's
critical
to
presenting
one
of
those
claims
is
not
in
the
hands
of
the
plaintiff.
it's
either
in
our
computer
database
or
in
the
records
of
the
creditors
who
in
the
crediting
reporting
agencies
give
the
information
to.
and
that's
why
when
congress
passed
this
statute,
it
said
that
there
were
going
to
be
certain
disclosures
that
it
was
going
to
require
either
the
credit
reporting
agencies
to
make
or
the
creditors
to
make.
but
it
also
specified,
because
of
concerns
about
the
burdens
of
record
keeping,
quite
finite
periods
of
time
by
which
those
records
would
have
to
be
kept.
so,
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
a
credit
reporting
agency
only
had
to
keep
a
list
of
who
a
disclosure
was
made
to
for
6
months,
and
now,
as
amended
in
1996,
they
only
have
to
keep
it
for
a
year.
and
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
there
was
no
requirement
placed
upon
a
subscriber
to
our
database,
one
of
the
creditors,
for
any
time
period
they
had
to
keep
their
own
records.
now,
in
1976,
the
equal
credit
opportunity
act
was
passed,
and
the
federal
reserve
board
promulgated
regulations
requiring
that
a
creditor
keep
records
of
any
action
it
takes
to
deny
credit
for
up
to
25
months.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
because
of...
of
the
enormous
amounts
of
information
that
are
retained,
the
record
retention
policies
of
credit
reporting
agencies
and
creditors,
pursuant
to
guidance
received
from
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
federal
trade
commission...
record
retention...
we...
we
get
rid
of
those
records
at
the
end
of
2
years
as
a
credit
reporting
agency,
and
the
banks
get
rid
of
them
after
25
months.
so,
the
claims--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--the
underlying
credit
information
is
preserved,
as
long
as
it's
not
negative,
forever.
if
it's
negative,
the
statute
prohibits
the
credit
reporting
agencies
for
retaining
it
for
more
than
7
months.
but
remember
what
the...
the
claim
is
is
an
improper
disclosure.
so,
what
you
have
to
know
is,
is
who
was
the
information
disclosed
to
and
when.
and
this...
the...
that's
a
separate
data
field.
and
under
the
statute,
that
list
has
to
only
be
maintained
for
a
year
after
1996
by
the
credit
reporting
agency.
so,
the
only
way
to
find
out
that
a
disclosure
has
been
made
is
either
within
a
year...
or
we
actually
keep
it
for
2
years
because,
in
the
case
of
an
employment
application,
you
have
to
keep
it
for
2
years,
or
from
the
creditor,
and
they
only
keep
it
for
25
months.
what
that
means
is,
is
that
claims
that
aren't
discovered
within
2
years
that
would
be
preserved
under
this
statute...
the
underlying
records
that
would...
would
reliably
prove
whether
a
disclosure
has
been
made
and
contained
an
inaccuracy
won't
exist.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
we
would.
and
the
reason
we
wouldn't
is...
for
example,
california
has
already,
under
its
state
consumer
code,
changed
its
statute
of
limitations
to
be
a
discovery
rule,
but
the
credit
reporting
agencies
haven't
changed.
and
the
reason
is
we...
we
have
no
desire
to
facilitate
the
bringing
of
causes
of
action.
and
i'm
going
to
be
honest...
candid
with
the
court
about
it.
and
the
information
is
expensive
to
retain.
so--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
ginsburg.
i
do
know
from
my
client
and
partners
who
practice
in
this
area
regularly
that
their
impression
is
no
state
has
a
statute
of
limitations
that
is
longer...
i'm
sorry.
no...
no
state
has
a
record
keeping
requirement
that
exceeds
the
federal
record
keeping
requirement.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
we
would
go...
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
as
long
as
the
federal
law
or
state
law
doesn't
require
us
to
keep
the
records
any
longer
than
the
present
1-year
requirement,
we're
not
going
to
keep
the
records
for
any
longer--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--as
far
as
the
record
keeping.
what
i
would
suggest
is
it
would
leave
the
courts
and
our
clients...
to
the
extent
that
claims
are
asserted
after
the
records
are
gone,
it
will
be
left...
we
will
be
left
defending
against
claims
that
are
based
upon
quite
unreliable
evidence,
and
the
courts
will
be
left
adjudicating
claims
that
are
based
upon
quite
unreliable
evidence
because
the
underlying
documents
won't
exist.
and
the
reason
that
i
would
like
to
make
that
point
to
the
court,
justice
ginsburg,
is
because
the
very
most
fundamental
purpose
of
a
statute
of
repose...
of
the
repose
aspect
of
a
statute
of
limitations
is
to
prevent
society
and
its
courts
from
being
burdened
with
claims
that
can't
be
reliably
proved.
and--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens,
because
no
one
disputes
in
this
case
what
congress
contemplated
in
the
record
keeping
requirements.
and
my
point
to
the
court--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--the...
the--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
the...
the...
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is...
is
no.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's...
that's
true.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
and
i
think
the...
the...
i
can't
tell
you
that
i
have
actual
empirical
information,
and
my
client
would
tell
you
that
the
number
of
inaccurate
disclosures
is
de
minimis
relative
to
the
number
of
accurate,
proper
disclosures.
that's
why
we
maintain
reasonable
procedures.
but
i
can
tell
you
this...
and
i
think
this
is
the
issue
in
this
case...
is...
how
long
did
congress
contemplate
that
we
would
keep
those
records
for,
and
what
statute
of
limitations
did
congress
correlate
with
those
record
keeping
requirements?
because
when
asking
what
could
congress
have
intended
through
this
statute
of
limitations
rule,
when
it
only
said
that
we
had
to
keep
the
records
for
6
months
in
1970
and
for
a
year
in
1996,
it
couldn't
possibly
have
been
contemplating
that
it
would
create
a
statute
of
limitations
that
would
produce
unreliable
claims
for
the
court,
that
the
more...
much
more--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--the
statute...
yes
because
the--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--it
understandably
gives
the
plaintiff
some
time
to
commence
their
lawsuit.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
correct.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
nothing
other
than
lots
of
expense.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i...
i
think
the
answer
is
you
plainly
do
not
owe
them
deference
in
the
chevron
sense
because
they
don't
have
rulemaking
power
and
they're
not
the
only
agency
charged
with
that
administration
of
this
statute.
and
i
don't
think
that
you
owe
them
skidmore
level
respect
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
first
time
they've
articulated
this
position
is
in
their
brief
in
this
case.
they
don't
address
the
language
of
the
statute
other
than
to
say,
well,
other
words
in
other
statutes
have
been...
haven't
foreclosed
the
importation
of
a
discovery
rule,
and
so
perhaps
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
import
one
here.
and
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
language
of
this
statute
is
very
clear.
it
may
not
be
perfectly
clear,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
phrase,
liability
arise,
has
a
plain
english
meaning,
which
corresponds
very
naturally
with
the
liability
provisions
of
section
616
and...
and
section
617.
and
the
overwhelmingly
strong
negative
implication
of
the
misrepresentation
exception,
which
has
an
express
reference
to
a
discovery
rule...
and
as
you
noted,
justice
ginsburg,
both
the
senate
and
the
house
bills
had
a
date
of
violation
language.
and
the
conference
committee
report,
which
changed
that
language
and
added
the
misrepresentation
exception,
commented
that
its
action
was
taken
only
for
the
purpose
of
adding
the
misrepresentation
exception,
not
for
changing
the
underlying
meaning
of
the
basic
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that's
correct.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
think
that
in
some--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--with
respect
to
just
a
pure
improper
disclosure,
it
may.
i'm
not
sure
i
know
the
answer
to
the
question.
what
i
can
say...
and
i
think
this
may
not
answer
your
question,
but
i
think
it's
important
for
you
to
know...
is
that
if
a
case
of
identity
theft
has
occurred
here,
the...
our
individual
consumer
who
isn't
aware
of
the
disclosure...
they
will
find
out.
they
may
not
find
out
in
a
month.
they
may
not
find
out
in
6
months,
but
once
the...
a
report
is
issued
in
a
false...
to...
to
a
person
who
isn't
the
consumer,
if...
if
the
consumer
later
applies
for
credit
and
they're
denied
credit,
they
have
to
be
told
by
the
creditor
that
denies
them
credit
why
they're
denying
them
credit
and
where
they
got
the
consumer
credit
report
from,
and
then
they
can
go
check
on
our
database
as
to
what
actually
is
on
the
database.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no,
no.
they
may
because
they
may
not
apply
for
credit
within
2
years.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no,
no.
what
i'm...
what
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that
there
are
improper
disclosures
that
might
not
be
discovered
within
2
years.
but
if
there
is
a
disclosure
which
adversely
impacts
an
individual's
credit
rating
and
their
desire
to
obtain
credit,
they
will
find
out
about
the
fact
that
their
credit
has
been
impaired
when
they
do
apply
for
credit,
whether
it's
within
the
2-year
period
or
not.
now,
they
won't
know,
because
the
records
won't
exist
any
longer,
who
that
credit
information...
what
other
creditors
that...
that
information
was
given
to,
but
the
underlying
data
about...
will
be
in
the
database
about
what
their
credit
is
and
why
their
credit
is
being
adversely
impacted.
that...
that
was
the
point--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--and
they'll
have
a
claim
about
that
specific
injury
if
the
specific
injury
is
in
year
3
i
was
denied
credit,
because
in
order
for
that
credit
to
be
denied,
there's
going
to
be
a
new
credit
report
that's
requested.
that
will
be
a
new
disclosure,
and
if
the
new
request
for
credit
is
denied
because
of
something
in
the
credit
record
reflecting
the...
the
fact
of
earlier
multiple
applications
for
credit
that
have
been
denied,
they
have
to
be
told
that
and
they
have
to
be
told
who
gave
it
to
them.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
if
you
look
at
the
claims
in
this
case,
the
two
claims
that
are
subject
to
this
court's
review
right
now
are
the
oddball
claims.
they're
the
improper
disclosure
claims,
not
the
inaccuracy
claims.
there's
no
doubt
the
respondent
had
a...
had
the...
found
out
within
the
2
years
and
thus
had
the
ability
to
timely
bring
a
claim
about
when
she
was
actually
denied
credit
herself.
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i'm
not
sure
i--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--she
finds...
she
finds--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--when
does
she
apply
for
credit?
that's--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--if
she
applies
in
year
8,
she'd
have
a...
a
remedy
for
the
credit
that
she
was
denied
in
year
8.
she--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--she
could
sue
the...
the
credit
reporting
agency
for
inaccurately
disclosing.
if
i'm
understanding
you
correctly,
there's
a
new
report
that's
issued.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
oh,
i'm...
i
misunderstood.
if
there's
not--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--in
the
absence
of
a
willful
misrepresentation,
not...
not
under
this
statute.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it's
almost
inconceivable
that
they
wouldn't
ask
again,
and
it's
also
probably
slightly
less
inconceivable
but
still
relatively
inconceivable
they
would
still
have
the
records
because
it's
in
their
interest
and
i'm
sure
they
have
the
record
retention
policies
to
abandon
them
as
well.
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
let
me
move
quickly
to
the
presumption
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied.
it's...
it's
wrong
and
it's
wrong
for
two
reasons.
first,
insofar
as
they--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
said
that
in
the
absence
of
an
express
statement
by
congress,
it
would
imply
a
discovery
rule
into
this
statute...
into
this
statute
irrespective
of
the
particular
words
this
statute
chose
to
use.
and
so
there's
a
basic...
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling.
one
is
that
a
default
rule
will
be
a
discovery
rule,
and
secondly,
that
they'll
apply
that
default
rule
in
every
case
under
every
federal
statute
unless
the
statute
expressly
refers
to
discovery
for
the
basic
statute
of
limitations
rule.
with...
with
respect
to
the...
their
clear
statement
rule,
this...
neither
this
court
nor
any
other
court
of
appeals
that
i'm
aware
of
has
equated
a
statute
of
limitations
with
a
retroactive
law
with
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
or
with
any
of
the
areas
of
law
in
anglo-american
jurisprudence
where
this
court
has
said
that
it
will
require
a
specifically
clear
statement
from
congress
in
order
to
accept
the
proposition
that
congress
had
a
particular
intent.
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
embraced
a
discovery
rule
as
a
default
rule
have
said
in
the
silence
of
congress,
not
in
the
ambiguity
of
congress.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
our
primary
position
in
this
case
is
that
this
statute,
when
you
look
at
the
term,
liability
arise,
when...
when
the
court
looks
at
the
misrepresentation
exception,
when
it
looks
at
the
definitions
of
liability
in
sections
616
and
617,
the
only
reasonable
construction
of
this
statute
is
that
the
basic
statute
of
limitations
rule
is
the
traditional
complete
cause
of
action.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
correct.
we
would
also
say
if
the
court
chose
to
decide
what
kind
of
default
rule
should
be
applied
in...
in
this...
in
this
case
or
in
federal
cases
generally,
that
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
vastly
overstates
the
support
and
authority
for
using
a
discovery
rule
as
a
default
rule.
this
court
for
150
years
at
least
has
said
that
the
traditional
rule
is
the
complete
cause
of
action
rule.
this
court
has
made
exceptions
to
the
complete
cause
of
action
rule
in
the
cases
of
fraud,
in
the
case
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act,
and
in...
in
the
context
of
medical
malpractice
claims
in
the
federal
torts
claims
act.
but
both...
in
kubrick,
dealing
with
the
federal
torts
claims
act,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
in
that
case
said
that
the
general
rule
is
an
injury
rule,
not
a
discovery
rule.
and
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out
in
his
dissent,
an
injury
rule
would
be
the
thing
that
makes
the
most
sense
in
the
commercial
context
and
the
debate
in
that
case
was
simply
about
in
the
peculiar
context
of
medical
malpractice
claims,
what
should
the
discovery...
the
united
states
in
that
case
didn't
contest
that...
that
a
discovery
rule
shouldn't
apply.
and
the
question
was
what
kind
of
discovery
rule
should
apply.
now,
it
is
true
that
a
number
of...
of
courts
of
appeals...
and,
justice
ginsburg,
when
you
were
on
the
d.c.
circuit,
you
wrote
one
of
the
opinions...
said
that
in
the
late
1980's
in
the
wake
of
kubrick,
a
number
of
federal
courts
of
appeals
had,
in
fact,
adopted
discovery
rules
as
default
rules
in...
in
statutory
silence.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that...
that
congress
has
written
reams
of
united
states
code
against
the
traditional
rule,
not
against
the
discovery
rule,
that
once
you
enter
into
the
debate...
into
the
notion
of
using
a
discovery
rule
as
a
default
rule,
you
run
into
exactly
the
kinds
of
problems
that
the
court
faced
in
klehr
and
in
rotella
where
then
this
is,
well,
which
discovery
rule
do
we
use
now?
is
it--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
