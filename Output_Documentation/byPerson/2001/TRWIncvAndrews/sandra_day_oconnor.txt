when
did
the
injury
occur
here
to
the
respondent?
justice
sandra
day

disclosure
to
who?
i
mean,
when...
when
exactly
did
the
injury--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--disclosure
to
some
third
party.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
and
the
person
injured
may
never
know
about
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it...
it's
a
2-year
statute
of
limitations.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this
the
type
of
statute
that...
that
depends
largely
on
private
enforcement
to
implement
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
general,
i
think
you
would
look
at
this
as
one
that
envisions
private
enforcement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
not
what
we
said
in
holmberg.
that
was
a
much
more
limited
case--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--than
the
ninth
circuit
gave
it
credit
for.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
is
odd
in
the
context
of
a
statute
that
has
the
other
language
in
it
where
congress
spells
it
out.
yes,
here
we
think
there
has
to
be
discovery.
i
just
find
the
juxtaposition
in
this
statute
difficult
to
overcome.
