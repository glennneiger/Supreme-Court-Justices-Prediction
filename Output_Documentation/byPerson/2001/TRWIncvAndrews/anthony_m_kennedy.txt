justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
our
previous
cases
haven't
looked
at
when
liability
arises.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
some
other
noun
before
the
arise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
anything
turns
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let...
let
me
ask
you.
the
case
is
a
little
bit
difficult
because
we're
not
quite
sure
of...
of
the
boundaries
and
dimensions
of
the
negligence
cause
of
action
that
was
alleged
here.
and
i
assume
you're,
of
course,
contesting
liability.
i...
i
take
it
you...
you
do
concede
you
must
concede,
because
of
the
statute,
that
there
is
a
general
duty
on
the
part
of
the
reporting
agencies
and
trw
not
to
be
negligent
in
the
performance
of
its
statutory
obligation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
we
can,
i
guess,
then
consider
the
case
based
on
a
supposed
cause
of
action
where
there
is
negligence
and
there
is
injury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
in
this
case,
i'm...
i'm
sure
you
would
contest
it.
you
would
say
there
was
no
negligence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
understand.
you
mean
if
i
apply
for
credit
and
trw
checks
me
out,
they're
only
interested
in
the
last
2
years?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
the...
at
common
law,
as
i
recall,
i
think
under
california
statute
in
defamation
actions,
the
statute
began
to
arise
from
the
date
of
the
statement,
from
the
date
of
the
defamation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
assume
that
one
rationale
for
that
was
because
if
the
injured
party
doesn't
discover
the
statement
for...
for
2
or
3
years,
it's
necessarily
diminished
and
any
remediation
is
minor.
is...
is...
and
assume
that
is
the
rationale.
does
that
apply
to
you
or
not?
does...
does
the
fact
that
the
erroneous
credit
information
was
given
2
or
3
years
ago
in
most
cases
diminish
its...
its
injurious
nature?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
i
can
say
that.
i'm...
i'm
just
trying
to
think--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
it
is
quite
correct
for
you
to
begin
with
the
statute,
but
just
a
carryover
of
the
very
last
point.
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong,
wasn't
it,
when
it
said
the
general
federal
rule
is
that
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
run
when
a
party
knows
or
has
reason
to
know
the
injury?
i
mean,
that's...
that's
just
not
the
general
federal
rule,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
certainly
not
the
rule
of
this
court,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
sidetracked
you
on
the
statute,
and
i
think
that
is
the
right
place
to
begin.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
to
me
is
one
of
the
hard
parts
of
this
case.
it's
not
quite
expressio
unius,
exclusio
alterius,
but
it's
close.
and
congress
did
consider
whether
or
not
the...
the
rule
that
the
statute
begins
when
the
injury
arises
ought
to
be
modified
and
it
did
modify
it
for
a
misrepresentation
but
not
otherwise.
and
that's,
it
seems
to
me,
a
very
difficult
problem
for
you
to
overcome.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
true,
though,
that
under
what
i
think
is
the
prevailing
rule
in
most
circuits
at
least,
there
would
be
an
equitable
estoppel
there,
and
the
statutory
proviso
need
not
have
covered
that
unless
it
meant
to
indicate
that
there
was
a...
an
injury-based
statute
of
limitations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
might,
if
there
were
a
higher
interest
rate
charged
and
you
didn't
know
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
always
true
under
equitable
estoppel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
always
true
under
equitable
estoppel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have
that...
now,
it's
true
that
the
whole...
the
statute
doesn't
run,
but
you
don't
have
2
years.
