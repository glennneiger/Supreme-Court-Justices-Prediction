mr.
kent
l.

it's
really
the
second
question,
of
course,
whether
if
the
statute
has
an
injury
discovery
rule,
that
would
be
negated
by
the
misrepresentation
exception.
but
the
court
is
focused
on
that
and
there
is
a
direct
and
simple
answer
to
it.
in
this
court's
own
opinion
in
rotella,
at
page
555,
the
court
said,
in
applying
a
discovery
rule,
we
have
been
at
pains
to
explain
that
discovery
of
the
injury,
not
discovery
of
the
other
elements
of
the
claim
is
what
starts
the
clock.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
injury
discovery
rule
starts
the
clock
in
the
sense
that
once
you
become
aware
of
the
injury,
you
have
a
duty
of
inquiry
to
find
out
the
cause
of
the
injury,
who
caused
it,
whether
it
violated
your...
a
standard
of
care
that
was
owed
to
you.
if
in
making
that
inquiry,
the...
the
defendant
lies
to
you
about
one
of
those
aspects...
for
example,
he
conceals
what
he
actually
disclosed...
the
statute
then
gives
you
2
years
from
the
date
you
discover
the
truth.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
you're...
you're
mixing,
i
think,
two
points.
one
is
what
is
disclosed
to
you
as
the...
if
the
consumer.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
you
think
that
they
violated
your
rights
and
you
ask
them
something,
what
they
tell
you.
that's
what
the
misrepresentation--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
just
erroneous
information?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
see
that
you
would
have,
but--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
possible,
but
if
you
were
charged
a
higher
interest
rate,
you'd
probably
be
on
a
duty
of
inquiry
to...
reasonable
diligence
to
find
out
whether
that
was
injury
to
you.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
didn't
say
that
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
ask
them
to
correct
the
record.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you'd
be
entitled
to
ask
them
to
correct
the
records,
and
you'd
be
entitled
to
have
them
do
so.
but--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they'd
be
required
to
correct
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--here's
the
way
that
would
work,
as
i
understand
it.
if
i
asked
them
to
correct
the
records
and
they
failed
to
do
so
without
a
reasonable
cause,
i
could
bring
a
suit
to
require
them
to
correct
the
records,
and
if
they
willfully
refused
to
do
so,
i
might
be
able
to
prove
both
actual
damages
and
punitive
damages.
but
i
would
still
have
to
have
some
actual
damages
before
i
got
a
monetary
recovery.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that...
well,
i
think
the
word
liability
in
this
statute,
like
any
statute
that
uses
cause
of
action
accrues,
cause
of
action
arises...
these
are
ambiguous
terms
that
the
court
has
to
interpret
based
on
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
is
not
a
statutory
action
for
an
injunction.
there
is
a
statutory
action
for
damages
when
the...
when
the
defendant
either
acts
negligently--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
comes
from
the
invocation
of
the
common
law
when--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
it's...
it's
a
cause
of
action
that
perfects
the
rights
created
by
the
statute.
i
wouldn't
call
it
an
implied
right
of
action,
but
i
would
think
that
a
federal
court
sitting
in
equity
would
be
able
to
give
an
injunction
to
enjoin
repeated
violations
of
a
statute.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
doesn't
strike
me
as
a
startling
idea,
that
the...
that
an
injunction
can
be
given
in
a
situation
when
you're
not
able
to
obtain
money
relief.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
you
have
to...
you
have
to
determine
that
for
an
injunction
to
be
given.
but
this...
the
question
here...
i
mean,
the
second
half
of
the
question
i
think
is
easily
answered,
and
if
the
court
has
more
questions
on
that,
fine,
but
if
not,
i'd
like
to
address
the
first
question,
which
is
does
the
phrase,
liability
arise,
suggest
an
interpretation
that...
that...
from
which
we
would
conclude
that
the
injury
discovery
rule
applied
as
opposed
to
the
injury
accrual
rule.
and
congress
often
creates
remedies
for...
for
injuries
that
are
latent
or
hidden,
and...
and
it's
improbable
to
assume
that
when
congress
does
so,
it
intends
to
curtail
that
remedy
before
even
a
diligent
plaintiff
could
be
expected
to
learn
of
it.
and
so,
the
injury
discovery
rule
has
been
applied
by
the
courts
in
interpreting
these
kinds
of
vague
provisions
like
liability
arises
and
cause
of
action
accrues
to
give
them
meaning
in
the
context
where
there's
a
hidden
or
latent
claim
that
wouldn't
be
expected
to
be
discovered
in
the
ordinary
course.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there...
there
is
nothing
odd.
in
fact,
it's
ordinary,
as...
as
it
was
pointed
out,
for
this
kind
of
fraudulent
concealment
or
equitable
estoppel
rule
to
be
applied
to
a
statute
that
has
an
injury
discovery
provision.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the...
justice--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--justice
scalia,
the
misrepresentation
is...
is
of
any
fact
material
to
the
violation.
the
discovery
rule
is
only
of
the
injury,
as
this
court
said
in
rotella
and
as
the
other
courts
have
also
held.
if...
you...
you
can
know
of
the
injury
and
not
know
what
caused
it
or
who
or
whether
they
were
liable
for
it.
and
if
they...
the
defendant
lies
about
that,
when
you're
trying
to
inquire,
during
this
2-year
period
from
discovery
of
the
injury...
if
they
lie
about
that,
the
statute
can...
comes
in
and
says,
we're
not
going
to
let
them
profit
from
their
lie.
they're
going
to
be...
you're
going
to
get
another
2
years
from
the
time
you
discover
the
injury.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
sorry.
discover
the
lie.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is...
that
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--right.
this
statute
does
not...
is
not
a
codification
of
the
entire
doctrine
of
equitable
estoppel.
it's
a
specification
of
the
doctrine
of
equitable
estoppel
in
the
specific
context
of
these
kinds
of
claims.
and
it's
focuses
on
these...
these
specific
types
of
claims.
so,
i
don't
know
whether
it
intends
to
preclude
any
broader
equitable
estoppel
doctrine,
but
i
do
know
that
what
congress
has
provided
is
simply
a
application
of
the
equitable
estoppel
rule
in
the
specific
context
of
this
statute.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
you
have
the...
under
the
injury
discovery
rule,
you
have
the
requirement
that
the
plaintiff
act
with
some
reasonable
diligence.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
if
they
don't...
if
they
don't
make
any
inquiry
at
all
over
20
years,
i
think
a
court
could
conclude
that
they
didn't
act
with
reasonable
diligence.
i
certainly
don't
know
of
any
decision
applying
the
injury
discovery
rule
that
refuses
to
apply
it
simply
because
it
may
have
applications.
i
mean,
i've
never
seen
a
court
say
that
when
these
kinds
of
hidden
harms
are...
are
remedied
by
congress,
congress
meant
to
let
them
go
unremedied
if
they
weren't
discovered.
i
mean,
it's
just
the
opposite.
it's
because
as...
as
petitioner
says,
yes,
you
can
have
injuries
that
aren't
discovered.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the...
there
are
two
different
aspects
of
this
case.
one
is
the
inaccurate...
inaccurate
reports,
which
is
i
believe
what
you're
talking
about,
but
then
there's
the
thing
that
can
never
be
discovered,
which
is
the
improper
disclosure.
when
i
say
can
never
be
recovered,
i
mean
is
not
ordinarily
going
to
be
likely
to
be
discovered.
this
case
actually
only
involves
the
improper
disclosure.
and
the
court's
analysis
of
this
statute
of
limitations
issue
should
appropriately
focus
on
the
fact
that
these
kinds
of
improper
disclosures
are
inherently
hidden
and
not
going
to
be
known
by
the...
by
the
plaintiff.
