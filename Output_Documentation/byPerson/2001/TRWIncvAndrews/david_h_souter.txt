justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
saying
in
that
respect
it's
just
like
common
law
defamation.
the
minute
the...
the
defamatory
statement
is
out,
your...
your
injury
is...
is
complete
for
purposes
of
a
cause
of
action.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
your
only
point
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
i
take
it
what's
implicit
in
your
argument
is
that
if
they
are
not
given
notice
that
they
have
been
denied
credit
within
2
years,
chances
are
not
very
great
that
they're
going
to
get
that
notice
after
2
years.
isn't
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
i
know.
but
in
terms
of
probabilities,
isn't...
i...
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
assuming.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
know.
but
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
i
mean,
you're
saying
that
there
certainly
are
going
to
be
cases
in
which
the
2
years
will
have
passed
and
then
specific
injury
will
arise.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
if
there
were
anything
wrong
in
what
it
disclosed
to
her,
presumably
the
consumer
would
know,
and
that
would
start
the
period
running.
and
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
consumer
to
invoke
the
exception.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
assume
it's
a
misrepresentation
about
the
consumer.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
the...
if
the
behind-the-scenes
activity
of
the
credit
reporting
doesn't,
in
fact,
result
in
a
misrepresentation
about
the
consumer,
where
is
there
going
to
be
any
cause
of
action
ever
at
any
time?
proviso
or
no
proviso.
justice
david
h.
souter
a
false...
false
statement
about
the
consumer
in
a
matter
that
would
be
material
to
a
decision
to
extend
credit
to
the
consumer.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't...
i
guess
what
i
was
assuming
was
that
when
the
consumer
inquires,
the
consumer
is
told
all
those
facts
which
are
in
the
credit
reporting
company's
file
which
bear
on
the
consumer's
credit
worthiness
which
are
the
sorts
of
things
that
the...
that
the
credit
rating
service
discloses
when
a
credit
inquiry
is
made.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
there
any
reason
to...
i
mean,
i...
i'm
not
following
you.
are
you
saying
that
in
some
cases
they
won't
give
the
consumer
the
entire
file?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so,
you're
saying
that
if
the
credit
reporting
service
lies
to
the
consumer
when
the
consumer
says,
tell
me
what
you've
got
and
who
you've
been
telling,
then
the
proviso
would
have
some
work
to
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
under
your
theory,
the
consumer
is
never
put
on
notice.
