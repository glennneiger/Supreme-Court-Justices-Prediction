justice

scalia
can
you
get
nominative...
a...
nominal
damages
and
punitive
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
out
of
curiosity,
what...
what
are
the
statute
of
limitations
applicable
to
state
actions
for,
let's
say,
trade
liable
i
suppose?
somebody
gives
out
inaccurate
information
about...
about
the
financial
standing
of
a
particular
person
or
company.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
the
statutes
run?
do
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--normally
run
from...
from
the
date
of
the
liable
or
from
the
date
that...
that
the
person
finds
out
about
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
they
would
also
prove
meritorious
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
say
there
was
a
new
report.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
unlikely,
of
course,
that
sears
is
going
to
be
using
an
8-year-old
report
without
asking
again,
and
you'd
probably
give
the
same
information
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
had
no
cause
of
action
before
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
henderson,
your...
your
response
to
justice
breyer's
question
leaves
me
with...
with
some
confusion
as
to
what
you
mean
by
injury
discovery
rule.
i
assumed
it
meant
at
the
time
the
consumer
knows,
one,
that
he's
been
injured,
number
two,
by
the
defendant.
and
the
example
that
justice
breyer
was
given,
you
say
it's
enough
he
just
knows
he
was
injured
because
he
was
denied
credit.
is
that
the
rule
you
want?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
causation.
and...
and
you
don't...
it's
enough
that
he
knows
he
was
denied
credit
and...
and
the
statute
runs
then
even
if
he
doesn't
know
that
the
reason
he
was
denied
it
was...
was
the...
the
inaccurate
reporting.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
destroys...
it
destroys
the
exception,
so
you
don't
want
to
use
it
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
the
release
of...
of
confidential
information
an
injury?
that...
that
does
not
count
as
an
injury.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
find
that
a
credit
reporting
agency
has
given
incorrect
information
to...
to
somebody
who's
inquired.
i
haven't
been
denied
credit.
in
fact,
they
give
me
credit
anyway.
but
i
find
that
they
have
given
inaccurate
information.
is
that
injury
discovery?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i...
i
discover
that
the
credit
reporting
agency,
in...
in
its
information
to
sears,
included
erroneous
information.
sears
has
given
me
credit
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
i
had
any
injury?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
erroneous
information.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
detrimental.
it's
detrimental
but
sears
gives...
sears
gives
me
the
credit
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
i
suffered
any
injury
under
this
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
they'd
be
liable.
they'd
be
liable
in
a
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
an
injunction.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
the
word
liability
in
the
statute
refers
only
to
monetary
recovery?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
they
include
injunction
and
refer
not
merely
to
monetary
damages,
but
to
an
action
for
injunction?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
the
action
for
injunction
come
from
if
not
from
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
believe
in
federal
common
law.
if
there's...
there's
a
cause
of
action,
it's
a
cause
of
action
under
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
there's
any
liability,
but
you
can't
get
money
damages
before
there's
any
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
that
isn't
odd.
what's
odd
is...
what
is
odd
is
how
it's
expressed.
if...
if
the
first
part
was
expressed
in
intending
to
have
a
discovery
rule,
the
way
it
was,
you
would
expect
the
last
part
to
have
been
expressed,
the
action
may
be
brought
at
any
time
within
2
years
after
the
misrepresentation
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
course,
you
would
imply
2
years
after
discovery
of
the
misrepresentation.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you...
you
can
discover
the
misrepresentation,
that...
that
is,
the...
the
erroneous
credit
information.
you
can
discover
that
and
you
can
sue
indefinitely
after
that.
that
doesn't
start
anything
running.
it's
only
when
you
find
that
that
misinformation
has
caused
a
denial
of
credit
that
your
cause
of
action
arises.
you
can
just
leave
it
there.
