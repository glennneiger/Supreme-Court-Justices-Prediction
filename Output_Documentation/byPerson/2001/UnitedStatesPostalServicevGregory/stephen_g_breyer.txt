justice
stephen
g.
breyer
justice
o'connor's
example?
and
let
me
add
one
thing,
that
the
prior
disciplinary
actions
are
being
grieved.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
question
was
do
you,
should
i
repeat
it
or
you
have
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
question
is
take
the
present
situation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
my
hypothetical,
it
can't
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
their
their
point
on
that
particularly
is
what
were
you
is,
all
right
the
the
particular
point
i
think
on
that
is
that
the
the
federal
circuit
really
just
said
the
m
the
mspb.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
woman
who
works
for
an
agency
is
late
for
the
twentieth
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
as
i
read
the
federal
circuit,
it
says
just
what
you
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
cannot
use
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mhm...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
so,
that's
their
approach.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
that
statute
seems
to
be
talking
about
cross
referencing
b.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
piece
of
paper,
which
says
you
were
convicted
nineteen
times
before
there're
nineteen
pieces
of
paper,
okay
whether
that
counts
as
evidence
towards
the
preponderance
to
support
what
they
did
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
make
the
argument
either
way.
