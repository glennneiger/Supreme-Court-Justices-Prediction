justice
antonin
scalia
this
would
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
union
could
say,
you
know,
i
think
you
deserved
it
and
and
we're
not
going
to
proceed
any
further.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
not
an
inju-
if
if
that
if
that's
what
it
is,
is
not
an
injustice
peculiar
to
this
arrangements.
justice
antonin
scalia
d-
do
you
think
that
for
purposes
of
either
collateral
estoppel
or
for
purposes
of
whether
a
criminal
court
can
use
a
prior
conviction
in
deciding
the
sentence
d-
do
you
think
it
it's
accurate
to
analogize
the
grievance
procedure
as
a
prior
case
pending
on
appeal?
or
would
you
rather
characterize
it
as
a
collateral
attack...
justice
antonin
scalia
final
action
by
the
employer?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
happens
to
collateral
attacks
when
you
have
a
final
criminal
conviction
and
there
is
a
collateral
attack
on
that
criminal
conviction,
although
the
conviction
itself
is
final?
when
a
sentencing
court
has
that
conviction
before
it,
does
it
not
use
that
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
the
collateral
attack
is
later
successful,
what
is
what
is
the
remedy
for
the...
justice
antonin
scalia
to
reopen
the
proceeding.
justice
antonin
scalia
remand
necessary?
what
i-
i-
if
we
agree
with
with
you
on
the
merits,
what
what
remains
to
be
decided
by
the
federal
circuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
d-
does
the
government
acknowledge
that
the
mspb
can
determine
that
it
is
arbitrary,
capricious,
or
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
agency
to
decline
to
reopen
a
proceeding
after
a
grievance
has
gone
forward
and
has
found
one
of
the
convictions
on
which
the
dismissal
is
based
to
have
been
invalid?
justice
antonin
scalia
regulations
permit
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
board's
right?
doesn't
the
board
have
to
find
that
the
agency
action,
in
refusing
to
reopen,
is
arbitrary,
capricious,
or
an
abuse
of
discretion?
i
mean,
the
board
can
say
when
it
will
reopen
it's
own
cases,
but
but
the
board
can't
tell
the
agency
when
the
agency
must
reopen
its
cases,
can
it,
unless
the
failure
to
reopen
is
arbitrary
or
capricious?
justice
antonin
scalia
talking
about
ultimate
success
in
the
grievance
and
then
then
the
employee
comes
back
to
the
agency
and
says,
look,
you
you
goofed.
justice
antonin
scalia
board
find
that
to
be
an
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
proposition
that
they
are
not
final
in
in
in
the
sense
that
that
that
a
a
judicial
determination
is
final.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
a
grievance
is
not
pending,
the
board
would
have
to
review
the
prior
disciplinary
action
to
be
sure
that
that
was
supported
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
surely
it
surely
it
doesn't
mean
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
the
burden
of
proof
is
this
employee
has
been
convicted
of
prior
disciplinary
violations
in
the
past.
justice
antonin
scalia
saying
that's
not
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
same
presumption
still
valid
even
though
the
the
action
is
being
grieved?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
as
though
it
were
unilateral
employer
action
without
a
hearing
and
procedural
guarantees.
justice
antonin
scalia
judgment
is
final
until
un-
un-
and
what
you're
grieving
is
employer
action,
and
and
that
action
is
final
until
a
grievance
overturns
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
already
conceded
in
in
response
to
an
earlier
question
of
mine
that
y-
that
the
that
the
board
does
not
have
to
establish
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
the
accuracy
of
any
prior
disciplinary
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
thought
you
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
been
no
grievance.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
your
answer
is
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
he
or
she.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
i'm
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
board
has
to
assume
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
other
situation
in
which
the
the
r-
the
ref-
the
re-
the
review
of
agency
action
is
conducted
on
a
basis
more
demanding
than
the
agency
action
itself?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
agency
ignored
the
fact
that
that
that
a
grievance
was
pending,
you
assert
that
would
have
been
entirely
lawful.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
it's
on
appeal
to
the
merit
systems
protections
board,
you
say
the
merit
systems
protection
board
can
reverse
the
agency
because
at
that
stage,
suddenly
the
fact
of
the
prior
disciplinary
action
is
not
determinative.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
other
instance
in
administrative
law
where
what
the
agency
does
is
right,
but
on
appeal
it's
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
go
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course,
it
has
to
worry
about
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
evidence
is
g-
is
is
good
evidence
before
the
agency,
the
mere
fact
of
the
prior
disciplinary
action,
but
it
suddenly
becomes
bad
evidence
before
the
merit
system
protection
board.
justice
antonin
scalia
proven.
justice
antonin
scalia
i-
i-
i-
i-
is
that
right?
i
mean
i
d-
justice
antonin
scalia
can
say,
well,
it
wasn't
proven,
but
you
know,
i
think
we
ought
to
put
this
on
your
record
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
has
to
find,
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
the
employee
was
guilty
of
the
alleged
infraction.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine...
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
should
say
that
even
when
there
is
no
grievance,
the
board
should
not
take
account
of
the
prior
of
the
prior
disciplinary...
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say
even
if
it's
not
being
grieved.
