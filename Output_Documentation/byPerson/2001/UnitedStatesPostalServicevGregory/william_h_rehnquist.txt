united
states
postal
service
versus
maria

mr.

[inaudible]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
if
we
reverse
on
the
question
presented,
we
should
leave
it
to
the
federal
circuit
to
decide
whether
to
direct
reopening
of
the
proceedings
or
to
affirm
the
mspb?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
brands,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
talking
now
about
review
before
the
mspb,
not
before
the
federal
circuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
we're
reviewing
here,
mr.
brands,
is
not
the
merit
systems
protection
board's
action,
but
the
action
the
federal
circuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
understand
it,
the
federal
circuit
here
said
this
was
not
in
accordance
with
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
you
you
say
it's
u-
not
in
accordance
with
law,
and
then
in
the
same
sentence,
you
say
it
arbitrarily
disregards
the
burden
of
proof.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a-
and
which
i
don't
think
the
federal
circuit
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
the
the
that's
that's
s-
standard
you
say
governs
the
merit
systems
protection
board?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
basis
for
the
federal
circuit's
decision
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
d-
where
do
you
find
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
blamed
on
the
government?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
if
you're
talking
about
judicial
proceedings,
i
don't
think
those
rules
would
necessarily
carry
over
to
this
sort
of
rather
low
level
administrative
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
say
that
the
prior
is
rev-
reviewed
de
novo,
i'm
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
an
entirely
accurate
statement
because
it
was
a
prior
that
was
left
unchallenged,
i
take
it,
at
the
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
statement
then
is
limited
towards
the
sort
of
prior
which
is
un-
under
review.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
employer
says
there
is
a
prior
here,
as
well
as
the
current
conduct,
that
has
never
been
grieved,
n-
never
been
challenged?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
throughout
the
admis-
the
proceedings
for
the
merit
system
protection
board,
in
the
d-
initial
decision
of
the
administra-
it
u-
the
petitioner's
referred
to
the
respondent's
referred
to
as
the
appellant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
did
the
federal
circuit
get
that
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
mr.
brands,
we're
reviewing
the
federal
circuit's
decision
here,
not
the
mspb's
decision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
you
tell
th-
that
one
cryptic
phrase
how
can
you
tell
that's
what
it
meant
by
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
garre,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
no.
00-758
united
states

service
versus
gregory
