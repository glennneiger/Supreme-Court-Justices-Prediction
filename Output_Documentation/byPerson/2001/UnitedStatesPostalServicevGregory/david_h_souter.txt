david
h.
souter
may
may
i
just
ask
you
to
get
into
this
problem
of
months
and
years?
the
months
and
years
problem
i
i
understand
is
is
simply
a
function
of
of
what
you
claim
to
be
the
slow
pace
of
arbitration.
justice
david
h.
souter
my
my
poin-
i
guess
my
point
is
that
you
say
this
is
the
situation
that
exists.
justice
david
h.
souter
invites
delay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
garre,
apropos
of
the
remand,
you
mentioned
that
the
respondent
had
not
brought
to
the
board's
attention
the
fact
that
the
arbitrator
had
ordered
the
first
disciplinary
action
vacated.
justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
answer
the
question,
would
would
you
tell
us
why
it
would
make
any
difference
whether
it
is
whether
there's
the
collateral
proceeding
going
on,
whether
there's
a
direct
attack
going
on?
why
isn't
there
a
presumption
of
regularity
that
attends
the
government's
action
until
it
is,
in
fact,
overturned
as
a
result
of
the
arbitration...
justice
david
h.
souter
the
arbitration
proceeding.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
but
i
mean,
that
gets
us
back
to
the
question
we
keep
going
back
and
forth
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
prove
the
existence
of
the
infraction
in
substance
just
as
if
they
were
proving
it
as
part
of
the
current
charge?
and
it
seems
odd
to
me
to
say
that
they
would
have
to
prove
it
just
as
much
as
if
it
were
part
of
the
current
charge.
justice
david
h.
souter
collateral
estoppel
applies.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
be
no
presumption
of
regularity.
justice
david
h.
souter
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
is
that
the
that
the
aggravating
fact
is
subject
to
exactly
the
same
burden
of
proof
that
the
specific
instance
of
of
later
conduct
is
is
is
subject
to,
the
the
the
instance
that
gets
us
before
the
board
on
appeal
anyway.
