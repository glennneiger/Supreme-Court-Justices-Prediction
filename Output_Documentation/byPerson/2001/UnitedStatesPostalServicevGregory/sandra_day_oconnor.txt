where
is
section
seventy-seven
oh

in
the
material
before
us
in
the
briefs?
justice
sandra

o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
after
four
disciplinary
actions
were
taken
against
her,
the
respondent
was
terminated
from
her
employment
at
the
united
states
postal
service.
at
the
time
of
the
termination,
the
first
three
of
the
disciplinary
actions
were
the
subject
of
ongoing
grievance
procedures
pursuant
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
postal
service
and
respondent’s
union.
the
respondent
appealed
her
termination
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
which
rather
than
holding
off
review
of
the
three
actions
pending,
the
outcome
of
the
grievance
proceedings,
the
board
went
ahead
and
reviewed
the
actions
independently
under
the
framework
set
forth
in
its
case
of
bolling
versus
the
department
of
the
air
force.
during
the
board’s
review
process,
the
respondent’s
first
grievance
was
resolved
in
her
favor
but
petitioner
did
not
inform
the
board
which
found
her
termination
to
be
reasonable.
on
review,
the
federal
circuit
held
that
the
board
may
never
rely
on
disciplinary
actions
that
are
pending
in
grievance
proceedings
in
determining
the
reasonableness
of
a
penalty
on
appeal
to
the
board.
we
hold
that
the
board
need
not
hold
off
its
review
pending
the
outcome
of
union
grievance
procedures.
it
may
instead
review
disciplinary
actions
pending
in
grievance
independently.
such
independent
review
meets
the
civil
service
reform
act’s
requirement
that
the
board’s
actions
not
be
arbitrary
capricious
and
abusive
discretion
or
otherwise
not
in
accordance
with
law.
no
one
has
suggested
that
the
board
has
applied
its
independent
review
policy
arbitrarily
or
that
it
lacks
reasons
for
its
approach,
nor
independent
board
review
contrary
to
any
law.
if
the
review
under
the
board’s
precedent
in
the
bolling
case
is
itself
adequate,
a
question
which
is
not
before
us,
then
the
postal
service
may
need
its
burden
of
proof
under
the
civil
service
reform
act
by
prevailing
either
before
the
board
or
in
the
grievance
proceedings.
the
board’s
statutory
authority
to
review
serious
disciplinary
actions
taken
against
workers
covered
by
the
act
must
include
the
authority
to
independently
review
the
more
minor
disciplinary
actions
upon
which
the
serious
actions
are
based.
and
the
board’s
independent
review
may
reach
a
different
result
than
that
reached
in
grievance
proceedings,
but
this
is
merely
the
result
of
the
parallel
review
systems
established
by
the
civil
service
reform
act.
because
the
board’s
practice
is
not
to
rely
on
disciplinary
actions
instead
of
already
been
overturned
in
grievance
proceedings,
however,
we
remand
to
the
federal
circuit
to
determine
the
effect
of
the
resolution
of
respondent’s
first
grievance
on
the
board’s
decision.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
