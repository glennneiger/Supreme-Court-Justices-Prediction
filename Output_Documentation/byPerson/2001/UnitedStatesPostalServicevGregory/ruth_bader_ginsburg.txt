in
civil
litigation
generally,
when
there
when
there's
a
proceeding
that's
dependent
on
a
prior
proceeding
that's
on
appeal,
the
standard
operating
procedure
is
for
the
second
proceeding
to
be
held
at
abeyance
pending
the
appeal
of
the
first.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
doesn't
prevent
it,
but
it
is
the
standard
proceeding
to
hold
the
second
one
in
abeyance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
you
don't
have
the
the
anomaly
of
giving
effect
to
a
judgment
that
has
been
overturned.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why,
if
the
agency
action
goes
into
effect
immediately?
what
what
i'm
presenting
to
you
is
the
the
thing
goes
through
the
agency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i-
i-
would
you
explain
that
if
to
me?
two,
why
would
the
why
if
the
firing
is
is
okay,
at
least
until
it's
overturned,
why
couldn't
the
the
agency
fill
the
vacancy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
disagreement
between
you
and
the
respondent,
is
there
not,
about
whether
the
m-
b-
the
agency,
the
postal
service,
is
bound
or
whether
it's
only
the
mspb.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
pb
rule,
that
you
if
if
while
the
mspb
thing
is
still
going
on,
one
of
the
grievances
e-
the
mspb,
if
the
person
hasn't
been
fired,
will
reconsider.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
discretionary,
isn't
it?
that
the
board
doesn't
have
to
reopen
if
it
doesn't
want
to.
justice
ruth
bader

government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
you
would
hold
the
second...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
abeyance
would
apply.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
be-
m-
before
you
finish,
i'd
like
you
to
answer
the
government's
assertion
that
your
neat
solution,
which
is,
agency,
you
can
fire
this
persons,
but
mspb
must
abide
the
grievance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
does
weaken
your
argument
that
the
government
serves
its
purpose.
