mr.
henk
brands
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
henk
brands
the
mspb
has
held
that
whenever
the
agency
comes
before
the
mspb
and
relies
on
aggravating
facts,
not
necessarily
the
particular
charge
before
the
mspb,
but
other
things,
for
example,
the
employee
is
simply
not
very
good
or
or
something
like
that,
that
has
to
be
proven
as
well
by
by
a
preponderance
de
novo
in
the
mspb.
mr.
henk
brands
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
always
the
same.
mr.
henk
brands
and...
mr.
henk
brands
certainly
when...
mr.
henk
brands
no,
justice
scalia,
we're
not
saying
that.
mr.
henk
brands
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
analogy
that
the
government
would
like
to
draw
is
to
an
agency
action
that
is
subject
to
section
seven
oh
six
review
under
the
apa,
but
that
is
not
the
right
analogy,
we
respectfully
submit.
mr.
henk
brands
right.
mr.
henk
brands
well,
that
is
true,
and
perhaps
the
brevity
of
the
a-
of
the
discussion
by
the
court
of
appeals
can
be
explained
on
the
ground
of
of
the
fact
that
the
government
did
not
respond
to
any
of
respondent's
arguments
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
henk
brands
and
that's...
mr.
henk
brands
that
is
correct,
but
nevertheless,
its
judgment,
we
think,
is
is
right
on
the
money.
mr.
henk
brands
that
is
correct.
mr.
henk
brands
we
think
it
actually
was,
your
honor,
because...
mr.
henk
brands
the
petition
appendix
seven
a
where
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
its
rule
is
necessary
because
the
foundation
of
the
board
of
the
mspb's
douglas
analysis
would
otherwise
be
compromised.
mr.
henk
brands
and
again,
we
would
we
would
suggest
that
the
del-
telegraphic
nature
of
that
may
may
also
be
blamed
on
the
government's
conduct
of...
mr.
henk
brands
well,
let
let
me
just
explain
real
quick
what
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
meant
by
that.
mr.
henk
brands
i
don't
think
i
said
that,
your
honor.
mr.
henk
brands
well,
the
the
statutory
burden,
of
course,
always
applies.
mr.
henk
brands
no,
it's
not
necessarily
yes.
mr.
henk
brands
i
would
distinguish
between
three
factual
scenarios.
mr.
henk
brands
no,
that's
actually
not
entirely
true.
mr.
henk
brands
[inaudible]
mr.
henk
brands
that's
pre-
that's
precisely
correct,
mr.
henk
brands
precisely.
mr.
henk
brands
we
th-
we
don't
think
it
is
enough
in
a
situation
like
this
situation
where
the
prior
is
being
grieved,
and
here's...
mr.
henk
brands
well,
the
bolling
rule
is
squarely
before
the
court.
mr.
henk
brands
we
think
it
is
enough
in
a
situation
where
the
prior
has
become
final
on
its
own
steam.
mr.
henk
brands
that
is
not
how
we
would
characterize
it.
mr.
henk
brands
we
would
not
view
it
as
a
collateral
attack.
mr.
henk
brands
very
well.
mr.
henk
brands
i...
mr.
henk
brands
we
think
there's
no
presumption
of
regularity
because
when
the
action
comes
for-
before
the
board
or
before
an
arbitrator
itself,
it
is
not
entitled
to
any
reg-
mr.
henk
brands
simply
for
this
reaner-
reason,
justice
justice
souter.
mr.
henk
brands
well,
i
would
i
would
distinguish
between
three
situations.
mr.
henk
brands
that
is
correct,
although
that
burden
will
be
very
easy
to
discharge
in
a
case
where
a
prior
has
already
become
final
or,
for
that
matter,
where
a
prinor-
prior
was
never
attacked.
mr.
henk
brands
presumption
of
regularity
are
applied
to
a
government
action
that
itself
is
entitled
to
deference
when
it
is
reviewed
by
a
court.
mr.
henk
brands
the
government
action,
if
it
is
taken
to
the
mspb,
is
not
entitled
to
any
deference
at
all
because
the
government
bears
the
burden
of
proving
de
novo
that
what
happened
actually
occurred.
mr.
henk
brands
that's
precisely
correct,
although
as
i
said,
in
two
situations
that
is
a
burden
of
proof
that
should...
mr.
henk
brands
third
situation.
mr.
henk
brands
your
honor,
far
be
it
for
me,
of
course,
to
to
argue
that
collateral
estoppel
should
apply,
but
the
mspb,
for
example,
has
applied
collateral
estoppel
to
prior
final
arbitral
orders,
and
we
don't
necessarily
see
anything
wrong
with
that.
mr.
henk
brands
no,
your
honor.
mr.
henk
brands
that's
that's
precisely
correct.
mr.
henk
brands
situation,
it
would
ordinarily
be
reasonable
for
the
government
to
argue
and
the
mspb
to
to
agree
that
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
exists
in
such
a
situation
because
if
the
if
the
employee
thought
that
a
preponderance
did
not
exist,
then
he
or
she
would
probably
have
taken
it
to
the
mspb
or
to
an...
mr.
henk
brands
well,
the
agency
is
not
is
not
s-
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
agency
may
simply
level
a
charge
is
not
subject
to
this
burden
of
proof.
mr.
henk
brands
i
would
not
characterize
this
as
an
appeal.
mr.
henk
brands
when
the
agency
levels
its
charges,
brings
its
charges
in
the
first
place,
it
does
not
have
to
worry,
do
we
ha-
can
we
sustain
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
henk
brands
well,
it's
not
bad
evidence.
mr.
henk
brands
well,
your
honor,
it
i-
that
is
true.
mr.
henk
brands
that
is
simply
because
before
the
federal
cir-
before
the
mspb,
the
burden
is
on
the
government
agency
to
prove
its
charges
and
review
is
de
novo.
mr.
henk
brands
it's
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
page
fifty-one,
and
we
refer
to
it
in
our
our
claim
rested
on
the
on
this
on
this
burden
of
proof
in...
mr.
henk
brands
the
government
can
fire
her.
mr.
henk
brands
no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
henk
brands
and
because
you
did
it
nineteen
times
before,
we're
firing
you
today.
mr.
henk
brands
now,
however,
when
that
removal
comes
to
the
mspb,
mr.
henk
brands
in
the
ordinary
case,
those
nineteen
priors
will
have
become
final.
mr.
henk
brands
it's
not
a
question
of
reasonableness,
your
honor.
mr.
henk
brands
respectfully,
your
honor,
that
is
not
how
the
mspb
itself
has
interpreted
section
seventy-seven
oh
one
c
one
b.
mr.
henk
brands
circumstance,
and
in
our
view,
it
couldn't
really
have
been,
be
any
other
way.
mr.
henk
brands
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
henk
brands
what
i
was
referring
to
when
i
was
referring
to
that
phrase
on
page
seven
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
henk
brands
well,
it
actually
said
it
twice,
your
honor.
mr.
henk
brands
that's
actually
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
henk
brands
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
henk
brands
but
the
question
is
whether
whether
there's
any
reason
for
the
mspb
to
defer
to
that,
and
we
submit
no.
mr.
henk
brands
prosecutor
coming
before
a
trial
court.
mr.
henk
brands
justice
scalia,
i'm
i
i
wouldn't
would,
p-
i
wouldn't
put
it
right
th-
that
way
or
precisely
that
way.
mr.
henk
brands
well,
i-
i-
it's
an
argument
that's
raised
for
the
first
time
today
here
at
the
lectern.
mr.
henk
brands
well,
i
don't
think
it
quite
weakens
our
argument,
your
honor,
because
we're
talking
about
letter
carriers
in
this
particular
case,
for
example.
mr.
henk
brands
the
short
answer
is
no,
if
the
allegation
is
that
those
are
disciplinary
grievances.
