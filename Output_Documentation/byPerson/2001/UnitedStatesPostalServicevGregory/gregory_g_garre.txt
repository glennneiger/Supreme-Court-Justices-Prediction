mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
for
decades
federal
employers
and
the
merit
systems
protection
board
have
engaged
in
the
common
sense
practice
of
considering
an
employee's
prior
disciplinary
record
in
deciding
what
punishment
is
appropriate
for
subsequent
misconduct.
the
settled
practice
has
long
been
to
do
so,
even
when
a
prior
disciplinary
action
is
subject
to
a
pending
labor
grievance,
although
in
that
context,
the
board
permits
the
employee
to
collaterally
attack
the
prior
actions
in
proceedings
before
it.
in
this
case,
the
federal
circuit...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
overtur-
if
there...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
government
employer
bears
the
burden
of
proving
the
action
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
under
the
loun-
longstanding
framework,
which
is
established
by
the
board's
bolling
decision,
the
employer
has
to
prove
the
fact
of
the
prior
action,
and
he
has
to,
and
the
employer
has
to
im-
prove
that
it
was
preceded
by
certain
procedural
protections,
first,
that
the
employee
received
advance
notice
of
the
action,
second,
that
the
employee
had
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
charges
before
the
supervisor,
as
well
as
by
a
higher
authority
within
the
agency,
and
third,
that
there
was
a
record...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
does,
a-
and
that's
and
th-
that's
the
same
type
of
challenge
that
is
framed
in
the
early
stages
of
the
grievance
process.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
in
that
circumstance,
the
board
has
held
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
rely
on
that
action
to
defend
the
subsequent
action.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
first
of
all,
there's
grievances
can
be
pressed
before,
during,
and
after
appeals
before
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i-,
my
understanding
is
that
in,
even
when
a
grievance
is
proceeding,
the
board
would
would
proceed
with
the
processing
of
its...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i'm
sorry.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
board
can't
go
to
an
arbitrator
and
tell
him...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
a
matter
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agree-
arrangement.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that
can
happen
and
it
happens
at,
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
arrangement
is
the
the
grievances
are
withdrawn
by
the
union
or
they're
ri-
withdrawn
under
the
arrangement
that's
been
worked
out
under
the...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that
that
would
be
a
decision
left
to
the
arbitrator
under
the
framework
of
the
negotiated
grievance.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it's
it's
very
problematic.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
th-
there
are
several
problems
with
the
abeyance
rule
adopted
by
the
federal
circuit,
which
is
essentially
the
narrow
rule
which
is
hypothesized
by
respondent.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
first
of
all,
although
the
employee
is
paced
in,
placed
in
a
non-duty,
non-pay
status
when
she's
removed
by
the
agency,
she
continues
to
fill
a
permanent
slot
on
the
agency's
rolls,
and
if
the
abeyance
rule
is
going
to
require
agencies
to
keep
the
employee
in
that
position
for
months,
if
not
years,
on
end,
that's
problematic
from
the
employer's
perspective.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
the
employee
is
placed
under
the
practice
followed
by
the
postal
service
and
i
believe
other
employers
as
well,
the
employee
occupies
the
full-time
slot,
and
until
her
removal
is
affirmed
by
the
board,
she
continues
to
fill
that
slot.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
i
think
they
have
tried,
but
the
fact
is
that
in
the
postal
service,
there's
currently
a
hundred
and
twenty-six
thousand
grievances
pending
in
that
process,
backlogged.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
this
is
the
situation
that
exists,
and
the
board
isn't
required
to
hold
its
appeals
in
abeyance
while
that...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
first
of
all,
the
inherent
informality
of
the
grievance
and
arbitration
process
is
always
going
to
invite
delay.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
that
hasn't
happened,
and
i
don't
think
it's
unique
to
the
postal
service
ar-
arbitration
context.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
i
think
it's
the
latter.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
absolutely.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
they
can
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
we
think
that
this
court
should
decide
the
question
presented,
reverse
the
decision
below,
and
remand
for
further
proceedings,
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
grievances
were
withdrawn
by
the
union
when
the
board
affirmed
the
the
removal.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
the
issue
that
that
remains
open
is
the
question
of
what
effect
the
grievance
that
has
been
set
aside
should
have
on
the
board's
decision
affirming
the
removal.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
we
th-
we
th-
that's
what
we
would
ask
this
court
to
do.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
we
we
think
that
the
fairest
reading
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
as
it
applies
both
to
federal
employers
and
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
the
holding
of
the
court
is
unqualified.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
first
of
all,
we
don't
we
don't
think
that's
the
fairest
interpretation
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
the
the
board's
regulations
permit
the
board
to
reopen
any
case
at
any
time
to
reconsider
it
in
light
of
a
grievance
which
may
have
proved
successful.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
the
the
typical
practice
is
that
the
employee
will
go
to
the
board
and
say,
reopen
my
appeal
because
this
grievance
has
proved
successful.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
the
employee
may
do
that,
and
the
board
may
do
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
is
discretionary,
and
that's
really
no
different
than
any
other
reopening
procedure
which
would
exist
to
to
enable
a
court
or
other
body
to
reconsider
something
in
light
of
subsequent
evidence.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
think
that
they
are
final.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
think
that
the
board
can
take
those
into
account
under
the
bolling
framework,
which
allows
the
board
to
consider
the
prior
disciplinary
actions
under
a
procedural
perfr-
framework
which
looks
to
the
procedural
protections
provided
in
those
proceedings
and
then
considers
whether
those
actions...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
to
reopen
the?
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
those
arbitrations
could
go
forward.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
under
the
memorandum
that's
in
place,
if
the
respondent's
removal
were
affirmed
by
the
board,
then
under
the
memorandum
in
place,
the
union's
practice
is
to
withdraw
those
agreements
under
the
collective
bargaining
arrangement.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
bring
that
to
the
attention
of
the
board.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
federal
circuit
ruling
in
this
case
is
not
based
in
any
way
on
the
burden
of
proof
applied
in
board
proceedings.
