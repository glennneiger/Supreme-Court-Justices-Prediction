what
about
the
employer?
can
the
postal
department
s-
d-
say
,
well,
you
know,
this
this
sh-
sh-
she's
not
an
employee
here
anyway,
we're,
you
don't
need
to
continue
this?
or
is
it
y-
you
you
leave
me
with
the
impression,
rightly
or
wrongly,
that
this
this
i-
the
that
this
is
just
at
the
option
of
the
union.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
proceed
if
it
wants
or
doesn't
have
to
proceed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
we're
trying
to
establish
and
i
think
you
would
have
to
concede
that
there
are
some
instances
in
which
once
the
employee
is
terminated,
the
grievance
proceedings
as
to
other
matters
must
stop.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
because
it's
the
option
of
the
union
other
than
what
the
union
agreed
to
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
bargaining
agreement
is
silent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
e-
if
it's
c-
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
there's
no
choice
in
the
matter,
the
grievance
is
stopped.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
fatal
to
your
case,
but
if
this
happens,
i
think
we
should
confront
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
rebuttal
time,
but
there's
one
question
that
that
that
that
still
hasn't
been
answered
for
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
position
be
before
the
postal
service
as
to
the
union's
request
to
reopen
those?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
to
or
to
continue
those
un-
una-
those
pretermitted
grievance
proceedings.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
objection
to
those
going
forward?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
the
union
was
obje-
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
go
forward,
the
and
the
postal
service
didn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
still
that
isn't
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
because
this
in
this
case
we
have
a
grievance
that
was
not
fully
determined.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
trouble
with
the
proposition
you
just
stated,
but
this
case
is
with
an
with
an
unadjudicated
grievance
or
or
grievance
with,
that
had
not
been
fully
determined.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
briefs
correct
in
telling
us
there
are
a
hundred
and
twenty-six
thousand
pending
grievances
in
the
postal
system?
