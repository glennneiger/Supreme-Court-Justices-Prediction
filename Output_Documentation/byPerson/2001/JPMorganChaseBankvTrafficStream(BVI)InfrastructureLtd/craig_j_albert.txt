mr.
craig
j.
albert
[ns]
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
i'm
referring
to
english
law,
mr.
craig
j.
albert
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
it
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
inquiry
had
the
united
kingdom
actually
cited
to
any
statute
or
any
case
ever
decided
in
any
english
court
anywhere
on
the
subject,
mr.
craig
j.
albert
well,
actually,
the
british
nationality
act
carves
out
classes
of
citizens,
and
classes
of
subjects,
and
persons
who
are
neither
bri-
i-
neither
citizens
nor
subjects,
mr.
craig
j.
albert
well,
i
i
think
that
the
question
here
is
whether
the
deference
should
be
unyielding
to
a
litigation
and
advocacy
position
which
the
british
government
puts
forth
in
its
briefs
versus
the
substantive
basis
for
that
position
which
one
would...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
respectfully,
justice
honor
o-
o'connor,
i
i
think
i
i
think
that
the
conclusion
ought
to
be
different,
because
there
is
nothing
wi-
the
f-
the
first
step
in
the
inquiry
is,
what
would
thirteen
thirty-two
a
two
have
to
say
about
corporations,
and
we
know
that
thirteen
thirty-two
a
two
is
a
reference
to
citizens
or
subjects
which
is
consistently
wh-
which
before
the
letson
fiction
was
adopted
had
had
resulted
on-
had
resulted
in
severe
conflict
over
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
for
corporations
at
all.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
respectfully,
justice
ginsburg,
thirteen
thirty-two
c
does
not
say
that
corporations
are
citizens
of
their
states.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
thirteen
thirty-two
a
two,
humans,
then
applying
the
thirteen
thirty-two
c
presumption,
that
would
bring
corporations
within
the
scope
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
yes,
i-
there
there
is
a
reference
to
it,
but
not
in
the
not
in
the
not
in
the
provision
of
thirteen
thirty-two
a
two
on
the
on
the
o-
on
the
extension
of
that
dispute
between
citizens
of
a
state
and
citizens
or
subjects
of
a
foreign
state,
and
in
fact,
mr.
chief
justice,
congress
in
fact
had
used
the
word,
aliens,
the
broader
r-
the
broader
word,
in
the
original
enactment,
in
the
judiciary
act
of
seventeen
eighty-nine,
but
congress
abandoned
that
language
when
it
revised
the
statute
in
eighteen
seventy-five.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
in
scotland,
yes,
because
a
because
the
scottish
people,
the
english
and
welsh
people,
and
the
people
of
northern
ireland
all
are
citizens
of
the
metropolitan
united
kingdom,
the
united
kingdom
of
great
britain
and
northern
ireland.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
[inaudible]
mr.
craig
j.
albert
i
think
that
the
distinction
is,
i-
no
one
is
disputing
here
that
the
british
virgin
islands
is
subordinate
to
the
united
kingdom,
no
one
is
disputing
that
its
people
ultimately
are
answerable
to
the
authority
of
the
united
kingdom,
but
that
that...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
[inaudible]
mr.
craig
j.
albert
subject
to,
not
subject
of,
and
that
is
why
the
british
nationality
act
is
so
important
here,
mr.
craig
j.
albert
i-
no,
justice
breyer.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
the
proper
allegation
in
a
case
like
this
would
be
that
a
corporation
is
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
scotland
and
is
therefore
a
citizen
or
subject
of
a
subject
of
the
united
kingdom.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
is
because
england,
wales,
scotland,
and
northern
ireland,
along
with
the
channel
islands,
are
the
constituent
parts
of
the
metropolitan
united
kingdom.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
because
when
parliament
enacts
a
law
of
general
applicability
within
the
united
kingdom,
its
applicability
is
to
those
four
jurisdictions
that
i've
mentioned,
england,
wales,
scotland,
and
northern
ireland,
along
with
in
in
some
instances
the
channel
islands,
but
it
does
not,
of
its
force,
extend
to
the
british
overseas
territories,
the
british
dependent
te-
the
and
the
what
what's
now
known
as
the
british
overseas
territories.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
they
are
not
stateless
people
at
all.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
they
are
just
a-
i-
they
are
they
are
very
similar
to
what
our
territorial
residents
would
have
been
before
we...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
residents
of
u.s.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
they
were
nationals
and
natives.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
no,
they
were
not.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
i
do
not
advocate
the
position
that
the
matimak
the
matimak
court
adopted
that
these
corporations
were
stateless.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
i-
they
belong
to
the
united
kingdom,
but
that
does
not
answer
the
statutory
question
at
issue
here,
because
even
if
they
belong
to
a
kingdo-,
e-
even
if
they
belong
to
the
united
kingdom,
that
does
not
make
them
citizens
or
subjects
of
the
kingdom.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
congress...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
justice
scalia...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
the
laughter
from
the
audience
in
fact
i-
-ocuses
focuses
the
point
here,
because
that
was
the
fundamental
shift
in
the
understanding
of
the
colonists
and
their
relationship
to
the
british
government.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
oh,
we
had
been.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
justice
stevens,
there
are
two
places
in
which
that
abandonment
can
come
about.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
it
certainly
has
not
happened
here,
but
there
is
another
way,
because
when
nations
adopt
the
idea
of
volitional
allegiance,
the
new
idea
of
what
a
subject
is,
then
the
nation
itself
can
change
its
laws
to
determine
what
the
status
of
its
people
are.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
but
the
british
nationality
act
does
have
to
do
with
what
the
people
within
the
british
virgin
islands...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
or
more
particularly,
as
we
would
treat
one
of
our
territories,
because
the
ability
of
congress
to
legislate...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
yes.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
they
are
not
subjects...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
the
position
that
that
has
been
advocated
here,
and
i
think
that
the
a-
a-
and
that
-as
been
uniformly
advanced
by
the
scholars
is
that
citizenship
versus
subjectship
is
simply
i-
simply
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
determini
i-
describing
what
the
relationship
is
of
one
in
either
a
democracy
or
a
monarchy,
and
what
has
happened
in
the
united
kingdom
is
that
as
the
country
has
evolved
from
a
strict
monarchy
to
a
constitutional
monarchy
with
democratic
principles,
that
the
ideas
of
subjectship
have
evolved,
and
the
idea
of
citizenship
has
been
incorporated
into
their
law.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
i
would
have
thought
that
had
the
united
kingdom
had
a
statute
on
which
it
could
rely,
or
any
decision
on
which
it
could
rely,
it
would
cite
them.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
is
in
the
lodging
at
page
l
thirty-one,
an
excerpt
from
its
diplomatic
manual
which
describes
the
various
categories
under
the
british
nationality
act.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
manual
b-
th-
mr.
craig
j.
albert
i
think
it
is
a
pure
advocacy
position,
mr.
craig
j.
albert
it
does
not
deserve...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
justice
kennedy,
the
uk...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
i
think
that
at
the
second
level
of
matimak
inquiry,
when
th-
th-
that
the
court
would
necessarily
have
to
inquire
as
to
whether
or
not
a
person
is
or
is
not
a
subject,
and
i
think
that
that
i
would
be
w-
i
am
willing
to
concede
that
britain
could
change
its
statute
for
general
purposes
or
for
limited
purposes
so
as
to
give
to
these
territorial
citizens
the
right
to
proceed
in
american
courts,
and
we
would
defer
to
that
simply
by
reason
of
simply
simply
for
reasons
of
international
comity.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
sovereignty
is
that
power.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
the
land
that
sits
in
the
middle
of
london
at
leicester
square,
famous
tolk
versus
moxie
land,
is
subject
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
kingdom,
but
that
does
not
make
the
land
a
subject,
and
so
the
mere
fact
that
the
united
kingdom
adopts
legislation
which
regulates
behavior
of
its
people,
both
within
the
metropolitan
united
kingdom
and
within
its
territories,
does
not
mean
that
the
people
within
its
territories
are
subjects
for
purposes
of
thirteen
thirty-two,
and
i
say
that
becau-
i-
i-
especially
in
light
of
the
fact
that
as
we
stand
here
today
the
united
kingdom
has
adopted
a
new
statute
which
has
not
yet
come
into
force,
because
a
statutory
instrument
has
not
yet
been
signed
for
it,
which
will
render
the
british
depedent
territories'
citizens
to
be
british
citizens,
giving
those
british
citizens
now
the
right
of
abode
within
the
united
kingdom,
and
that
will
happen
in
the
future.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
i
think
that
a
that
a-
applying
the
l-
that
the
proper
way
to
apply
the
letson
principle
here
is
that
a
british
virgin
islands
corporation
should
never
be
subject
to
diversity
to
to
diversity
grou-
diveristy
jurisdiction
precisely
because
the
presumption
is
that
its
shareholders
have
opted
for
british
virgin
islands
status
rather
than
opted
for
british
status.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
the
s-
second
circuit
did
not
reach
the
constitutional...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
a
presumption
in
this
court
that
the
use
of
the
same
language
in
article
three
and
in
title
twenty-eight
means
that...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
because
if
you
look
to
the
judiciary
act
of
seventeen
eighty-nine,
which
was
adopted
nearly
contemporaneously,
congress
used
the
broader
language,
alien,
rather
than
the
narrower
language,
citizen
or
subject,
and...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
that's
correct,
mr.
craig
j.
albert
and...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
it
would
be
mere
speculation
on
my
part
to
suggest
what
it
was
that
they
meant,
since
this
was
one
of
the
least
debated
provisions
of
the...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
i
think
that
it
is
entirely
possible
that
in
seventeen
eighty-seven
congress
i-
the
convention
intended
to
extend
the
grant
of
authority
to
the
full
measure
of
diversity
jurisdiction
over
cases
involving
all
foreigners,
but
the
reason
that
i
don't
think
that
they
focused
on
the
issue
was
because
in
seventeen
eighty-seven
there
really
were
not
these
cases
of
i-
there
there
was
not
were
not
a
lot
of
cases
probably
no
cases
in
which
there
were
people
who
lacked
subjectship
yet
nevertheless
were
foreigners.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
think
that
the
canadians
were
subjects
of
the
crown
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
were
in
a
settler
colony
rather
than
in
a
plantation,
a
plantation
colony,
and
the
w-
one
of
the
difficulties
of
the
british
law
of
that
entire
era
is
that
it
never
really
had
a
unifor-
i-
it
never
had
a
uniform
picture
of
who
its
persons
were,
and
what
the
relationship
was
between
the
crown
and
each
one
of
the
different
types
of
colonies
that
it
created
and
that
was
very,
very
difficult
for
bri-
that
was
very
difficult
for
britain,
because
because
because
britain
had
different
types
of
colonies
which
promoted
different
types
of
british
interests,
and
therefore
it
created
different
types
of
governments
within
them,
and
created
different
statuses
with
respect
to
immigration
and
migration
to
europe
for
those
people.
mr.
craig
j.
albert
the
ones
that
are
certainly
not
subjects
right
now
are
those
which
are
the
british
overseas
territories,
which
include
the
british
virgin
islands,
the
cayman
islands,
bermuda,
mr.
craig
j.
albert
pardon
me?
mr.
craig
j.
albert
the
isle
of
man,
the
channel
islands
are
british
ci-
are
are
british
citizens,
mr.
craig
j.
albert
oh,
british...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
sorry
british
british
british
subjects,
and...
mr.
craig
j.
albert
the
falklands
the
falklands,
i-
th-
those

are
not
british

citizens.
