let's
assume
a-
and
i'm
not
sure
that
this
is
an
accurate
proposition
of
international
law,
that
a
subject
of
a
sovereign
has
a
special
duty
to
obey
the
laws
of
that
sovereign.

subject?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice

where
can
we
what
w-
where
can
we
document
the
proposition
that
you've
just
stated?
what
what
do
i
look
to
t-
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
she
cited
t-
justice
anthony

no
more
established
authority
like
blackstone,
or...

suppose
that
kind
of
person
that
justice
o'connor
and
you
just
discussed,
a
true
stateless
person,
is
temporarily
in
a
a
port
of
au-
australia,
or
san
francisco,
or
monterey,
mexico,
c-
c-
can
it
be
said
consistently
with
th-
the
statute
here
in
question
that
they
are
at
least
temporarily
subject
to
the
laws
of
australia
while
they're
there,
bec-
because
they're
stateless
and
they
have
no
other
higher
obligation,
so
they're
th-
then
subject...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
be
stateless
persons
who
are
not
within
the
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
comment
on
the
stateless
person
problem,
n-
not
not
not
a
a
a
legal
person?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
next
time
i'm...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
arguing
for
what
we
might
call
a
variable
definition
of
subject,
that
vi
residents
are
subjects
of
great
britain
in
some
cases
and
not
others?
that
is
to
say,
you
re-
said
earlier
that
the
uk
could
make
a
treaty
binding
on
vi
residents,
vi
citiz-
so
that
you
can
be
subject
of
th-
great
britain
in
some
instances
and
not
others.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
c-
characterize
your
argument
that
way,
would
would
that
be
a
proper
characterization
of
your
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
doesn't
that
potential
indicate
that
there
is
sovereignty
because
isn't...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
capacity
to
exercise
power
and
authority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
are
subjects
because
of
the
potential
of
the
exercise
of
that
power.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
about
leicester
square?
