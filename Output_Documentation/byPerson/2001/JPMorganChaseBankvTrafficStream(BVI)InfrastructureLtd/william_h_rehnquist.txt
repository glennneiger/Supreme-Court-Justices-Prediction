w-
when
you
say
the
united
kingdom
has
expressed
its
sovereignty,
ms.
reid,
do
you
mean
that
you're
looking
at
their
statutes,
or
that
their
diplomatic
representatives
have
made
a
representation?
chief

william

-ish
to
reserve
the
rest
of
your
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.

the
say
the
uk
takes
one
position
and
makes
a
representation,
but
the
state
dep-
our
state
department
disagrees?

william
h.
rehnquist
wh-
what
sor-
what
sort
of
an
action
should
our
t-
courts
take?
chief

william
h.

the
i-
i-
i-
if
you
were
to
submit
the
views
of
the
state
department
in
a
case
like
this,
no
matter
what
else
there
is
in
the
record,
we
should
accept
the
views
of
the
state
department?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
you're
now
relying
on
eng-
english
law,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
that
may
create
some
difficulty
for
united
states
courts,
particularly
when
the
uk
is
is
making
representations
here
as
as
to
one
point,
then
you
you
you
tell
us
we
have
to
lo-
read
english
law,
which
we're
much
less
familiar
with,
of
course,
than
american
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
i
i
i
realize
that.
