justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
suppose
even
as
to
natural
persons
in
this
sort
of
eccentric
island
i-
in
the
real
world,
if
if
we
didn't
recognize
their
claim
to
i-
to
individual
sovereignty
or
nationality,
in
the
real
world
i
assume
they
would
be
subject
to
some
other
national
sovereign
and
they'd
v-
by
that
virtue,
by
virtue
of
that
be
swept
up
under
the
the
term,
citizen
or
subject,
wouldn't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
reason
you
take
that
position,
i
take
it,
is
that
the
the
impetus
for
the
constitutional
grant
was
in
effect
to
to
keep
countries
from
getting
mad,
rather
than
for
purposes
of
extending
jurisdiction
as
such
to
everyone
who
whom
whom
one
might
want
to
sue
in
a
federal
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
second
case
that
i
have
to
announce
this
morning
is
no.
01-651
jp
morgan
chase
bank
against
traffic
stream
(bvi)
infrastructure
limited.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
by
statute,
the
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
cases
between
citizens
of
state
and
citizens
who
are
subjects
of
a
foreign
state.
the
respondent,
traffic
stream,
is
a
corporation
organized
under
the
laws
of
the
british
virgin
islands,
which
is
an
overseas
territory
under
the
political
authority
of
the
united
kingdom.
after
traffic
stream
and
a
new
york
corporation
the
petitioner,
jp
morgan
chase
bank,
became
embroiled
in
a
contract
dispute,
chase
attempted
to
sue
traffic
stream
in
federal
court.
the
second
circuit
held
it
because
traffic
stream
is
a
corporation
of
the
british
virgin
islands,
and
the
islands
are
not
recognized
as
an
independent
country,
jurisdiction
would
not
lie.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse.
both
the
jurisdictional
statute
and
the
constitutional
provision
allowing
alienage
jurisdiction
were
intended
to
insure
foreign
as
a
neutral
forum
for
dispute
resolutin.
in
this
way,
the
united
states
could
provide
incentives
for
foreign
investment
and
avoid
angering
foreign
governments.
given
the
pervasive
authority
exercised
by
the
united
kingdom
over
the
british
virgin
islands,
these
purposes
of
alienage
jurisdiction
must
serve
by
treating
the
british
virgin
islandsâ€™
corporations,
as
citizens
who
are
subjects
of
the
united
kingdom.
it
does
not
matter
that
united
kingdom
law
may
provide
fewer
rights
to
residents
of
the
british
virgin
islands
than
it
does
to
other
united
kingdom
subjects.
it
is
our
own
law
that
we
consult
in
determining
whether
a
corporation
will
have
access
to
our
courts,
and
it
is
beyond
dispute
to
the
nationals
of
a
foreign
state,
whatever
their
status
in
their
home
country,
might
be
treated
as
citizens
or
subjects
of
that
state
for
purposes
of
federal
jurisdiction.
