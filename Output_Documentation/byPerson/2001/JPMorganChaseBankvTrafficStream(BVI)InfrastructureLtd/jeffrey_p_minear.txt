mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
[ns]
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
that
you
should
defer
to
the
united
states
views
on
these
matters.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
cases
suggest
that
that's
that
is
the
result
that
would
follow.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
we
we
do
believe
that
you
should
defer
to
the
united
states
views,
as
because
oftentimes
on
the
question
that
l-
let
me
distinguish
here
the
question
of
subject
is,
of
course,
the
meaning
of
that
term
is
a
legal
question
that
this
court
would
interpret
according
to
its
normal
practices,
but
the
question
of
whether
a
foreign
entity
is
a
foreign
state
is
a
question
that
is
properly
entrusted
to
the
political
branches.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
a
an
individual.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
