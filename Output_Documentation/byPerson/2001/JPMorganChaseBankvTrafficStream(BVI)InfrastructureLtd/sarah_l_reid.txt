ms.
sarah
l.
reid
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
alienage
diversity
statute
provides
that
the
federal
courts
have
original
jurisdiction
of
civil
actions
between
citizens
of
different
states
and
citizens
who're
subjects
of
a
foreign
state
where
the
matter
in
controversy
exceeds
seventy-five
thousand
dollars.
the
question
presented
today
is
whether
respondent,
traffic
stream
bvi
infrastructure
limited,
a
corporation
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
the
british
virgin
islands,
qualifies
as
a
subject
of
the
united
kingdom
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute.
petitioner,
jp
morgan
chase
bank,
submits
it
clearly
does.
it
is
well
settled
that
the
term,
citizens
and
subjects,
applies
to
corporations
and
not
just
natural
persons.
it
is
also
not
controversial
that
a
subject
is
one
who
owes
allegiance
to
and
is
under
the
protection
of
a
foreign
state.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
in
terms
of
looking
to
this
matter
of
the...
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
subject?
in
determining...
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
submit
it
is
in
the
first
instance,
but
in
saying
that
must
then
look
at
the
nature
of
the
relationship
and
look
at
the
foreign
state
which
is
asserting
the
sovereignty,
and
certainly
that
is
a
matter
that
we
should
consider
ca-
carefully.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
both,
both
the
fact
that
they
have
i-
intervened
as
an
amicus
in
this
and
in
other
cases,
but
also,
particularly
in
the
case
of
respondent,
if
one
looks
at
the
bvi
constitution
enacted
in
nineteen
seventy-six,
it
is
enacted
as
a
result
of
the
act
of
parliament
and
the
order
of
parliament,
and
it
reserves
expressly
all
power
to
the
crown
ultimately,
and
it
is
only
from
the
crown
that
the
l-
the
law
is
then
delegated
to
the
elected
legislative
council.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
i
would
s-
say,
your
honor,
in
ninety-nine
percent
of
the
cases,
that
you're
right.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
right,
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
exactly.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
agree,
your
honor.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
i
would
agree.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
i-
an
an
an
analogy,
though,
not
completely
perfect,
but
it
i-
you
-ow
jp
morgan
chase
is
a
corporation
organized
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
similarly,
a
corporation
set
up
under
the
laws
of
of
applicable
oversea
territories
in
the
first
instance
of
course,
must
follow
the
laws
of
their
legislative
district,
but
they
must
also
abide
by
an
agreed
upon
laws
and
conventions
with
the
united
kingdom,
and
that
is
specifically
an
issue
in
the
caribbean,
where
there
are
certain
financial
disclosure,
which
is
is
i-
mandated
in
part
through
the
relationship,
constitutional
relationship
between
the
united
kingdom...
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
to
a
certain
extent,
the
treaties,
that
i-
for
example
the
narcotics
enforcement
treaty.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
and
the
united
kingdom
what
the
authority
and
sovereignty
that
the
united
kingdom
has...
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
not
that
i-
not
that
we
have
have
cited
to
your
honor,
though
in
many
ways
there
are
parliamentary
debates
that
you
can
tha-
a-
access
concerning
i-
which
are
referenced
in
the
white
papers
concerning
the
relationship
between
the
overseas
territories
and
and
the
g-
and
the
king,
which
are
quite
remiziscen-
reminiscent
of
the
debates
before
the
american
revolution
in
terms
of
virtual
repenta-
representation
and
citizenship...
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
in
very,
very
rare
instances,
and
those
instances
are
where
the
individual
has
either
renounced
their
citizenship,
which
has
ye-
on
occasion
occurred,
or
where
they
have
been,
you
know,
exiled,
and
have
not
yet
acquired
citizenship
somewhere
else,
and
we
would
submit
that
the
cases
cited
by
the
matimak
court
deal
with
those
kinds
of
statelessness.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
no.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
that
is
true,
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
yes.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
right.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
[inaudible]
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
the
the...
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
no.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
that
w-
i-
tha-
that
i
think,
was
the
entanglement
that
they
were...
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
[inaudible]
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
and
just
briefly
on
the
issue
of
the
promotion
of
commerce,
i
wanted
t-
to
make
the
point
that
jp
morgan
chase
bank
and
the
financial
markets,
you
know,
consider
the
matimak
decisions
as
ones
to
have
potentially
very
deleterious
effects
on
international
commerce.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
absolutely,
and
i
practice
before
them
f-
frequently,
but
the
perception
on
the
part
of
foreign
foreigners
is
that
the
federal
system
is
one
with
procedures
are
uniform
across
the
country,
and
a
per-
predictability,
perhaps,
i-
that
i-
is
more
a
matter
of
perception
than
of
reality.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
and
vice
versa.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
that
that's
true.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
no.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
no.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
court.
ms.
sarah
l.
reid
right.
