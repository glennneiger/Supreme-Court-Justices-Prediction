is
this
a
question
of
federal
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
who
is
a
citizen
or
subject
of
a
foreign
state,
or
whether
an
in-
or
whether
a
corporation
in
this
instance
is
a
citizen
or
subject?
is
that
a
federal
law
question?

if
we
were
dealing
with
a
private
individual
rather
than
a
corporation,
do
you
think
there
c-
could
be
a
stateless
person
who
wouldn't
fit
under
this
stat-?
justice

even
even
if
the
british
nationality
can
be
read
as
saying
that
corporations
formed
in
the
british
virgin
island
are
not
citizens,
it
doesn't
say
they're
not
subjects
of
the
united
kingdom,
does
it?

find
anything
that
indicated
to
me
that
a
corporation
formed
in
the
british
virgin
islands
was
not
a
subject
of
the
uk,
and
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
brief
filed
by
the
uk
that
says
they
are
subjects,
so
what
do
we...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
from
an
american,
us
perspective
under
the
statute,
citizens
are
subjects,
and
the
fact
that
it
is
a
corporation
formed
in
the
british
virgin
islands
would
lead
me
to
conclude
that
is
a
subject
of
a
foreign
nation
under
our
own
statute.
