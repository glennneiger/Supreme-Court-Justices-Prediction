ms.
reid,
every
corporation
must
be
formed
under
some,
the
law
of
some
sovereign,
and
if
that's
right,
a
corporation
just
can't
generate
itself.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why?
i-
w-
aren't
new
york
courts
fairly
versus
this
is
not
a
question
of
saying
for
our
corporation
you
can't
enter
a
us
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
it
is
a
little
different
from
what
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
post
revolution,
when
the
british
creditor
said
state
courts
are
simply
not
going
to
let
them
collect
on
their
debts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
anyway,
you
you
i
think
no
one
has
suggested
a
dynamic
interpretation
of
thirteen
thirty-two,
so
that
if
the
original
rationale
is
not
as
strong
today
as
it
was
then,
that
somehow
the
meaning
of
thirteen
thirty-two
would
change.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
i-
o-
no
other
circuit
has
followed
the
second
circuit,
have
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
are
some
us
citizens
who
don't
have
access
to
the
federal
court
because
they're
not
a
citizen
of
any
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
a
law
that
has
long
since
become
abs-
obsolete.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
those
words
cover
only
human
individuals
and
not...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
corporation
if
i
say
is
it
is
is
that
does
that
come
within
thirteen
thirty-two
jurisdiction,
a
corporation
formed
in
scotland?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
my
problem
is
if
if
take
some
the
british
virgin
islands,
a
place
that's
s-
still
held
in
something
like
colonial
status,
that
you
say
that
scotland,
which
has
a
great
deal
more
independence,
belongs
to
the
uk
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
subject
of
the
uk,
but
the
british
virgin
islands,
or
the
cayman
islands,
that
have
less
independence,
are
not
subjects?
that...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
may
be
something
a
lawyer
could
understand,
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
much
sense,
does
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
subjects?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
people?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the-
they
are
british
the
their
state
is
is
the
uk?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
of
and
to
the
united
states,
i
assume,
the
residents
in
the
us
territories.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
they
were
citizens?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
stateless,
were
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
why
isn't
a
corporation
organized
in
the
british
virgin
islands
or
the
cayman
islands
why
is
that
stateless?
there's
only
one
state
it
can
belong
to,
because
these
are
not
independent
sovereigns.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
belong
to
some
state,
and
if
you
wh-
either
they
belong
to
the
uk,
or
they
belong
to
something
that
isn't
a
sovereign,
or
they're
stateless.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
discomfort
in
saying,
well,
that's
what
the
uk
law
is,
and
you
told
us
that
what
the
companies
act
means,
when
the
uk
itself
is
telling
this
court,
you've
got
it
all
wrong?
er
are
y-
you
you're
standing
before
the
court
as
an
interpreter
of
uk
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
corporation?
you're
talking
about
what
will
be
the
status
of
individuals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
be
the
case
it
would
be
that
congress
would
be
immobile
as
well.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
one
i'm
putting
to
you,
because
the
statute
uses
the
same
term,
citizens
or
subjects.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
subject
means
within
article
three
that
it
doesn't
mean
within
thirteen
thirty-two
and
why
a
court
should
interpret
it
interpret
them
differently.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not
i-
in
the
constitution
says
citizen
or
subject,
doesn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mean
what
does
subject
mean
within
the
constitution,
within
article
three,
as
it
reads?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
urging
a
certain
statutory
interpretation,
and
then
you
said,
well,
maybe
it
has
a
different
meaning,
the
word
subject,
in
the
constitution,
so
i'm
asking
you
to
tell
me
what
could
be
those
different
meanings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
among
the
subjects,
or
well,
the
the
entities
that
are
under
uk
sovereignty,
which
of
those
are
subject
and
which
of
them
are
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ones
are?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
ones
are?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
ask
citizen,
i
said,
s-
subject.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
i-
if
they're
formed
under
scotland,
wales,
northern
ireland,
they're
okay,
yes,
but
if
they're
formed
under
bvi,
they're
not.
