i
guess
then
maybe
corporations
incorporated
in
scotland
are
not
citizens
or
subjects
either,
because
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
corporations,
does
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wouldn't
people
then
be
surprised
if
it
doesn't
say
anything,
if
we
said
that
scottish
corporations
weren't
citizens,
or
in
fact,
would
the
people
who
live
in
these
islands
be
a
little
surprised
if
the
supreme
court
were
to
say,
you're
not
nationals?
a-
how
how
is
it
work?
this
this
is
not
an
act
that
refers
to
corporations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are
but
these
people
aren't
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
english
law,
the
reason
that
although
their
eng-
their
law
says,
i
guess,
that
counselor
law,
the
diplomatic
manual,
the
thing
that
says
you
have
to
swear
allegiance
if
you're
in
the
british
foreign
you
know,
you're
in
the
british
virgin
islands,
all
the
laws
are
subject
to
british
authority
and
so
forth,
so
the
reason,
in
your
opinion,
despite
all
those
things
they
list
in
their
brief,
that
makes
it
very,
very
similar,
the
reason
that
a
corporation
incorporated
in
wales
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
kingdom
or
subject
of
the
united
kingdom
but
these
are
not,
because
it's
the
british
virgin
islands,
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
-ritish
nationality
act
has
nothing
to
do
with
corporations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
your
point
there,
but
so
i'm
cutting
you
off,
but
they
they
say
that
in
these
places
the
queen
appoints
the
governor,
the
governor
is
responsible
for
internal
security,
public
service,
and
court
administration,
but
all
the
laws
they
pass
in
these
places
are
subject
to
review
by
the
foreign
office,
the
commonwealth
office,
and
then
the
q-
the
the
the
queen
in
council,
which
is
a
group
of
particular
individuals,
that
the
legislative
council
swears
its
allegiance
to
to
the
crown
before
it
takes
place,
and
so
they
haven't
just
discarded
this
place
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
terri-
people
in
our
territories
like
puerto
rico,
let's
say,
which
is
a
commonwealth...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
or
samoa,
they
are
not
subjects
of
the
united
sta-
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
the
united
states,
and
are
not
subject
to
its
laws.
