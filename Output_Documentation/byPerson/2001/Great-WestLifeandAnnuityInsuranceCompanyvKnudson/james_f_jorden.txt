mr.
james
f.
jorden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners'
claim
for
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
reimbursement
clause
in
the
benefit
plan
at
issue
in
this
case
falls
squarely
within
the
language
of
erisa,
section
502(a)(3)(a),
which
appears
in
full
text
at
page
13
of
our
brief,
which
provides
for
a
civil
action
by
a
fiduciary
to
enjoin
any
act
or
practice
which
violates
the
terms
of
the
plan.
in
its
first
amended
complaint,
great-west
sought
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
prior
to
the
time
any
of
the
funds
were
disbursed
in
this
matter
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
it
sought
injunctive
relief
and
other
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
employee
benefit
plan.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
language
and
the
structure
and
the
purpose
of
erisa
support
the
proposition
that
section
502(a)(3)(a),
specifically
in
this
case
(a)(3)(a),
to
enjoin
the
knudsons
from
disbursing
funds
as
to
which
they
had
power
to
determine--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--well,
your
honor,
we
believe
it
is
equitable
relief.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
well,
your
honor,
two
things.
first,
i
believe
in
this
case
on
these
facts
the
injunction
was
a
typical
injunction.
prior
to
the
time
actions
were
taken
by
the
knudsons
to
disburse
any
of
the
funds
from...
from
hyundai,
an
injunction
was
sought
against
them
to
prevent
them
from
disbursing
those
funds
until
the
federal
claim
under
502(a)(3)--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--two
points
on
that,
your
honor.
first...
first
is
that
if
you're
assuming
that
there's
an
adequate
remedy
at
law--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--well,
one
would
have
to
presume
that
we
were
seeking
money
damages
in
this
case.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
concept
of
a
constructive
trust,
which
is...
which
is
employed
by
many
of
the
lower
courts,
the
courts
of
appeals,
to
enforce
these
reimbursement
causes--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--judge
posner...
judge
posner
in
health
cost
controls,
your
honor,
v.
washington
held
that
a
constructive
trust
was
a
proper
remedy
in
this
context.
and
indeed,
at
common
law,
a...
in
imposing
a
constructive
trust,
courts
of
equity
decided...
concluded,
because
after
all,
a
constructive
trust
was
essentially
imploding
legal
remedies
because
the
person
attempting
to...
to
impose
the
constructive
trust
did
not
have
legal
title
to
the
property,
therefore
courts
of
equity
had
to
step
in
and
impose
an
equitable
remedy.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is
precisely
within
the
language--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--we
sought
an...
an
injunction
at
several
levels,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
none,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
no
injunction
was
issued.
the
injunction
was
denied
by
the
district
court.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
we
sought
an
injunction
either
to...
for
the
federal
court
to
enjoin
the
state
court
proceeding
from...
from
the
second...
from
enforcing
that
settlement
or
to
enjoin
the
knudsons,
the
respondents
in
this
case,
from
disbursing
the
funds
that
were
ultimately
paid
out
in
that
settlement
or
from
directing
parties
who
received
those
funds
from
disbursing
those
funds.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
well,
as
a
part
of
the
mandatory
injunction,
the
language
of
the
mandatory
injunction
that
was
sought,
your
honor,
was
to
pay
the
plan
the
$411,000
that
the
knudsons,
unjustly
enriched,
owed
back
to
the
plan.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
well,
your
honor,
the
concept
of
specific
performance
for
the
payment...
for
the
enforcement
of
an
obligation
is
definitely
an
equitable
concept.
and
as
this
court
in
bowen
determined,
when
you
are
seeking
to
enforce
against
someone
that
they...
that
they
carry
out
the
very
obligation
that,
either
under
a
statute
or
under
the
terms
of
a
plan,
they're
obliged
to
carry
out,
as
was
the
case
in
bowen,
the
fact
that
money
might
ultimately
be
paid
does
not
make
that
money
damages.
that's
still
specific
relief.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
it
is
not
clear
to
me
if
equity
would
have
done
that,
your
honor.
but
i
will
say
this.
if
congress
decided
in
502(a)(3)
to
permit
fiduciaries
to
enforce
the
terms
of
a
plan,
they...
they
cited
in
502(a)(3)(a)
the
authority
to
seek
injunctions
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan.
it
is
clear
that
at
common
law
injunctions
were
equitable
in
nature.
the
fact
that
in
a
later
portion
of
502(a)(3)
it
refers
to
other
appropriate
equitable
relief,
it
seems
to
us,
simply
reinforces
the
notion
that
fiduciaries...
first
of
all,
fiduciaries
have
an
obligation--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--that's
part
of
our
argument,
your
honor.
it
is
absolutely.
section
404(a)
of
erisa
obligates
fiduciaries
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan.
it's
one
of
their
obligations.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
it's
hard
to--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--your
honor,
since
i
understand--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--that
the
congress
cannot...
cannot
simply
grant
injunctive
authority
and
call
it
equitable.
however,
it
is
quite
clear--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--that
enforcing
the
terms
of
a
trust
are
equitable.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
well,
i
think--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--oh,
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
true.
absolutely.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
is
equitable
in
nature?
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
well--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
a
declaratory
relief
can
be
both.
the
declaratory
relief
here
clearly
would
be
equitable
in
nature
because
it's
enforcing
the
terms
of
a
plan.
the
congress--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
we
are
seeking
restitution,
which
is
clearly
an
equitable
remedy,
which
was
recognized
by
this
court's
decision
in
mertens
as
an
equitable
remedy
and...
and
reconfirmed
in
the
more
recent
decision--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--of
harris
trust.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
no,
your
honor.
great-west--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--yes,
your
honor.
there
was...
there
was
a...
that
case,
the
pending
case...
a
summary
judgment
motion
was
filed
by
great-west
seeking
the
federal
court,
notwithstanding
the
judgment
in
the
state
court...
of
course,
great-west
was
not
a
party
to
the
state
court
proceeding,
your
honor.
the
federal
court
proceeding...
the
summary
judgment
motion
was
filed
seeking
the
reimbursement
claim,
the
restitution
amount.
the
district
court
denied
that,
and
that
case
was
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
said
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
because
you're
seeking
money.
and...
and
our
position
is,
first,
we
were
seeking
an
injunction.
that
gave
the
federal
district
court
jurisdiction.
that
gave...
that
gave
a
cause
of
action
which
they
could
consider
under
502(a)(3)(a).
and
beyond
that,
we're
seeking
restitution
for
the
balance
of
the
money
that
is
owed
the
plan
based
on
the
unjust
enrichment
of
the--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
well,
that
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
great-west...
great-west
had
no
obligation
to
intervene.
in...
in
some
cases,
in
fact,
in
jefferson...
pilot
v.
krafka,
which
is...
which
appears
at
page
29
of
our...
of
our
brief,
in
the
footnote
11...
state
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
to
construe
the
terms
of
an
erisa
plan
except
under
section
502(a)(1)(b)
of
erisa
which
allows
a
participant
to
bring
a
claim
for
benefits.
now,
if
the
participant
had
wanted,
as
the
court-appointed
amicus
brief
argues
that
this
should
have
all
been
decided
in
one
court...
if
the
participant
had
wanted
to
have
this
decided
in
state
court,
they
could
have
brought
great-west
in
by
alleging
a
claim
under
502(a)(1)(b).
now,
the
state
court
would
have
had
concurrent
jurisdiction.
that
is
the
only
place
in
erisa
which
gives
state
courts
jurisdiction
to
construe
the
terms
of
a
plan.
bearing
that
in
mind,
justice
o'connor,
if
great-west
were
to
intervene,
it
would
be
asking
the
state
court
to
construe
the
terms
of
the
plan
to
determine
the
status
of
its
restitution
rights.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the...
at
the
district
court's
decision,
which...
excuse
me...
the
state
court
decision,
joint
appendix
143,
the
state
court
makes
very
clear
that
it
is
in
the
process
of
making
its
decision
reviewing...
it
calls
it
the
health
insurance
policy.
it's
not
really
that...
reviewing
the
terms
of
the
plan
and
construing
the
terms
of
the
plan
for
the
purpose
of
determining
what's
the
appropriate
restitution,
what's
the
appropriate
reimbursement.
our
position
is
the
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
do
that
unless
they
were
doing
so
under
a
claim
brought
by
the
respondents
under
502(a)(1)(b),
in
which
case,
of
course,
we
could
have
removed
that
to
federal
court.
not
having
done
so,
we
also
don't
have
a
right
to
go
into
state
court
and
ask
the
state
court
to
construe
that.
now,
one
of
the
reasons
why
502(a)(3)
has
to
give
us
a
right
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan
is
because
we
know
the
beneficiary
has
a
right
to
do
that.
under
502(a)(1)(b),
it
can
go
into
state
court
or
federal
court
and
enforce
the
terms
of
a
plan,
including
to
get
benefits
and
money.
second,
we
ought
to
be
able
to
go
into
a
federal
court
and
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan.
and
the
fact
that
we
get
money
shouldn't
preclude
us
from
doing
that.
and
finally,
congress
requires
us
to
go
in
and
enforce
the
terms
of
a
plan
under
404.
and
indeed,
courts
have
uniformly
said
we're
entitled
to
do
that.
for
example...
a
very
clear
contract
case...
if
an
employer
fails
to
make
the
contributions
to
a
plan,
where
is
the
fiduciary
going
to
get
the
authority
to
go
and
sue
the
employer?
under
502(a)(3)(a).
that
is
where
they
go.
so,
there
is
no
reason
why...
congress
clearly
intended
under
502(a)(3)(a),
when
you're
enforcing
the
terms
of
a
plan,
unlike
as
in
mertens
where
you
were
not
enforcing
the
terms
of
a
plan,
where
you
were
not
enforcing
the
terms
of
a
specific
provision
of
erisa,
here
it
is
clear
that
we
should
be
entitled
to
enforce
the
terms
of
a
plan
even
if
that
means
preserving...
returning
money
to
the
plan.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
well,
your
honor,
if
it's
an
injunction,
it
doesn't...
our
view
is
it...
it
is
equitable.
by...
by
definition,
congress
has
said
it's
equitable.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
well,
we
believe,
your
honor--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--no,
i
would
say
not,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
congress...
as
this
court
has
said,
erisa
principles
start
from
trust
principles
unless
the
language,
the
structure,
or
the
purpose
of
erisa
is
to
the
contrary
with
respect
to
the
particular
issue.
there
are...
trust
principles
apply
in
enforcing
the
terms
of
a
plan.
you
can't
enforce
the
terms
of
a
plan
unless
you're
applying
trust
principles.
that
means
any
injunction
to
enforce
the
terms
of
a
plan
by
definition
must
be
equitable
in
nature.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
restitution--
mr.
james
f.
jorden
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
and...
and
citing
to
judge
posner
again
in...
in
health
cost
controls,
he
says
it's
legal
in
a
legal
case
and
equitable
in
an
equitable
case.
mr.
james
f.
jorden
and
in
that
case...
in
those
cases
where...
where
a
plan
is
seeking
restitution,
it's
equitable
in
nature.
if
i
may
reserve,
your
honor.
