justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
you?
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
that.
why
do
you
have
to
construe
the
plan?
it
seems
to
me
the
plan
is
perfectly
clear.
you're
enforcing
the
plan.
you're
not
construing
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
justice
scalia's
question
about
(a)(3)(a)?
supposing
the
statute
said
to
compel
any
party
to
do
x,
y,
or
z,
and
to...
in
such
a
case
they
may
call
the
remedy
an
injunction,
even
though
it
wouldn't
otherwise,
would
that
be...
does
congress
have
power
to
do
that?
compel
the
party
to
pay
money,
list
all
the
things
that
the
plaintiff
here
is
asking
for,
but
not
describe
it
as
an
injunction
and
then
say,
and
they
may
call
that
an
injunction
if
that
relief
is
granted.
why
couldn't
they
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
be
sure
you
cover
it
before
you
get
through?
what
about
it
being
within
(a)(3)(a)
and
that
(a)(3)(a)
just
gives
the
word
enjoin
a
very
broad,
non-historic
meaning,
according
to
my
hypothetical
a
second
ago?
why
is
that
impossible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
be
so
terrible
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
taranto,
can
i
ask
you
to
respond
to
an
argument
that
occurs
to
me?
if...
going
back
to
the
text
of
(a)(3),
if
you
just
had
(a)(3)(a),
i...
i
think
you've
agreed
one
could
read
that
to
just
have
a
sort
of
a
statutory
injunction
that
is
divorced
from
prior
equity
practice
and
just
includes
doing
anything
that
is
necessary
to
comply
with
the
plan.
but
you
respond
to
that
by
saying,
but
(b)
says
other
equitable
relief,
which
therefore
has
the
effect
of
narrowing
what
otherwise
might
be
a
permissible
reading
of
(a).
am
i
correct
that
that's
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
my...
my...
the
reason
i'm
concerned
about
that
response
is
it
seems
to
me
that
(b)
was
intended
to
broaden
the
remedies
available
rather
than
to
narrow
them,
and
you're
necessarily
construing
it
as
a
narrowing
construction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
taranto,
i
think
there's
some
tension
between
the
argument
you're
making
now,
which
is
certainly
a
persuasive
argument,
and
the
cases
you
cite
on
page
38
of
your
brief
that
talk
about
the
gap
between
federal
law
and
state
law.
