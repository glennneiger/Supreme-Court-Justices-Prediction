argument
next
in
no.
99-1786,
great-west
life
&
annuity
insurance
company
v.
janette
knudson.
mr.
jorden.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you...
what
you
sought
here,
mr.
jorden,
was
an
injunction,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
i
want
to
ask
you
some
detail
about
the
injunction
that
was
granted.
was
it
simply
an
injunction
that
required
the
respondent
here
to
hold
onto
the
funds,
or
was
it
an...
an
injunction
against
their
refusing
to
pay
the
funds
to
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
which
one
was
finally
issued?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what...
what
were
the
terms
of
the
injunction
which
you
sought?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
didn't
seek
an
injunction
against
them
for
refusing
to
pay
you
the
funds?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
you
have
a
claim
against
somebody
for
$1,000
because
you
painted
their
house,
could
you
go
into
court
and
get
an
injunction
against
them
refusing
to
pay
the
claim
to
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
it
has...
it
has
to
come
within
the
limits
of...
of
the
equitable
adjectives
in...
in
the
section
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you...
well,
you
say
then
congress,
when
it
said
you
can
grant
an
injunction,
didn't
mean
an
injunction
of
the
kind
that
the
courts
of
equity
traditionally
grant,
but
just
anything
the
court
felt
like.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
what...
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
i
certainly
don't
follow
that
at
all.
but
you're
certainly
entitled
to
make
the
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jorden.
mr.
wolfson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but...
okay.
why
did...
why
did
congress
limit
the
relief
to
the
term
equitable
then?
it
could
have...
it
could
have
given
a
much
broader
charter,
but
our
cases
interpreting
it
have
said
it
means
equitable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
a
real
limitation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
we
should
have
a
bivens
cause
of
action.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
can't...
don't
you
think
you
can
make
an
argument
that
since
congress
has
dealt
with
injunctions
in
(a),
(b)
does
not
authorize
injunctions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you...
thank
you,
mr.
wolfson.
mr.
taranto,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
legislative
history
indicating
why
congress
limited
the
relief
which
it
permitted
in
this
section
to
equitable
relief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
taranto.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-1786
great-west
life
and
annuity
insurance
company,
against
knudson
will
be
announced

scalia.
