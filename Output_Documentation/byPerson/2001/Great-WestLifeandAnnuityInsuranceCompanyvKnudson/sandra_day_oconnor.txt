excuse

mr.
jorden,
may
i
ask--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--a
question
not
quite
along
these
lines
of
whether
you
properly
sought
an
injunction,
but
acknowledging
that
you
did
seek
an
injunction
and
it
was
refused?
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
federal
court,
the
district
court,
refused
in
part
because
the
petitioner,
great-west,
said
that
it
only
had
a
right
to
that
part
of
the
settlement
allocated
to
past
medical
expenses
and
that
only
$13,828
was
allocated
to
past
medical
expenses.
that
was
part
of
the
reasoning
in
the
denial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
and
as
i
understand
it,
great-west
did
not
appeal
from
that.
i
mean,
it
just...
you've
accepted
that
apparently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
was
no
appeal,
was
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
was
it
that
great-west
didn't
intervene
in
the
state
suit?
certainly
it
knew
about
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
try
to
subrogate
the
claims
some
way?
