justice

--isn't
it
clear
that
declaratory
relief
is
neuter?
that
is,
you
can
have
a
declaratory
relief,
i...
x
owes
y
x
amount
of
money.
that's
the
declaration.
a
declaratory
judgment
can
be
either,
depending
upon
what
else
you
ask
for.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
else
you
could
ask
for.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
talk
about
injunction
and
specific
performance.
the
one
word
that
i
haven't
heard
from
you
yet...
and
i'm
surprised
i
haven't...
is
restitution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
this
is
what
you're
seeking
is
to
get
back,
to
recoup
what's
owed
the
plan
from
this
larger
pot.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
were
making
the
argument
that
in
any
case
restitution
was
an
equitable
remedy.
therefore,
even
if
we
leave
injunction
and
specific
performance
out
of
it,
what
you're
seeking--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
restitution--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
taranto,
what
about
the
presence
of
state
subrogation
laws
where
the
state
has
a
strong
law
reflecting
its
policy
that
there
shouldn't
be
any
subrogation
actions
in
the
state
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
taranto,
you...
what
you're
telling
us
then
is
that
there
would
be
no
preemption
in
this
class
of
cases,
that
in
this
class
of
cases
where
the
plan
insurer
is
saying
we
want
to
get
from
this
recovery
the
amount
that
we
advanced,
that
in
this
class
of
cases
you
would
have
an
entirely
federal
law
governed
claim
that
could
only
be
brought
in
state
court.
i
don't
want
to
talk
about
the
other
claims
that
you
might
have,
but
here
where
the
plan
insurance
company
says,
here's
this
tort
recovery,
we
want
our
piece
of
it,
we
want
that
restored,
we
want
our
advance
restored
to
us,
for
that
category
of
case,
you're
telling
us
you
have
a
claim
under
federal
law
that
can
be
brought
only
in
state
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
any
more
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--any
more
so
than...
than
the
back
pay
under
title
7,
which
is
money?
why
isn't
this
really
comparable
to
that?
i
mean,
congress,
one
would
assume,
didn't
want
compensatory
damages
or
punitive
damages,
and
that's
what
they
meant
when
they
said
appropriate
equitable
relief.
but
if
back
pay,
which
is
fungible
money,
can
be
classified
as
equitable,
why
not
this
kind
of
restitution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could
have
under
both...
i
think
this
is
correct...
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
under
title
7,
a
monetary
remedy
without
any
reinstatement.
