and
is...
is
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
that
argument
based
on
the
assumption
that
if
a
legislature
increases
the
injunctive
authority
of
a
court
by
statute,
that
injunctive
authority
is
still
equitable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
think
it
would...
i
think
you
would
want
to
say--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i...
i
thought
you
would
answer
yes
because
it
seems
to
me
that
helps
you.
i...
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
would
assume
that
a
legislature,
if
it's
a
state
court...
or
the
congress,
if
it's
a
federal
court...
can
say
the
injunctive
power
extends
beyond
what
was
traditionally
equity
to
a,
b,
and
c
and
that
you
could
still
call
it
fairly
equitable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
in
this
case
it
was
in
conjunction
with
declaratory
relief
i
thought.
have
we
ever
said
that
declaratory
relief
is
equitable
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
very
odd
that
you'd
have
a...
a
body
of
federal
common
law
that
can
be
applied
only
in
state
courts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
wasn't
there
a
reason
given...
the
limitations
on
the
plan's
ability
to
sue
elsewhere?
and
as
justice
stevens
and
justice
ginsburg's
line
of
questioning
suggests,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
(a)
and
(b)
are
both
going
to
do
some
work
in
the
statute,
that
to
insist
that
(a)
simply
embodies
the
historic
definition
of
equity
is...
is
too
narrow.
and
you
can
say
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
expand
the
injunctive
power
to
analogs
that
are
close
to
equitable
actions
here
in
accounting
or
instructions
to
a
guardian
or
instructions
to
a
trustee,
it
seems
to
me,
is
very
close
to
historic
equitable--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--even
if
congress
has
directed
otherwise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
question
is,
hasn't
congress
directed
otherwise
necessarily
in
(a)?
