mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
summarize
the
three
points
i
want
to
make
for
why
petitioners'
money
suit
does
not
request
appropriate
equitable
relief
and
therefore
is
outside
502(a)(3).
my
first
point--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i...
i
think
because
of
the
word
other
in...
in
the...
the
provision.
to...
to
separate
the
enjoin
clause
from
the
other
appropriate
equitable
relief
i
think
does
impossible
violence
to
the
congressional
specification
that
injunctions
are
a
subset
of
the
appropriate
equitable
relief.
one
practical
consequence
i
think
that
would
follow
from
wrenching
those
apart
would
be
that
a
plan
could
write
a
liquidated
damages
or
some
other
damages
provision
into
the
plan
and
then
seek
an
injunction
for
payment
of
that
money.
i
don't
think
that
that--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--oh,
i'm
not
sure
that
there
would
be
anything
terrible,
and
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
congressional...
i
mean,
i
think
congress
could
call
a
remedy
anything
it
wants,
subject
to
constitutional
constraints,
for
example,
seventh
amendment
constraints,
and
seventh
amendment
issues
might
well
arise.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
don't
think
one
is
enforceable.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
don't
know
how
much.
liquidated
damages...
i
will
make
specific
reference
to
another
provision
of
502,
which
is
502(g).
the
question...
congress
specifically
dealt
with
the
question
of
delinquent
contributions
by
enacting
section
515.
it
limited
515
to
delinquent
contributions
from
multi-employer
plans
and
plans
adopted
pursuant
to
collective
bargaining
agreements.
and
then
it
said
there's
a
specific
remedy
for
that,
502(g)(2),
which
talks
about
legal
relief.
that
expanded
the
universe
of
relief
available
for
a
particular
kind
of
monetary
issue
which
includes
liquidated
damages.
but
the
limitations
that
mertens
i
think
correctly
identified
in
502(a)(3)...
namely,
it's
limited
to
equitable
relief...
by
its
terms,
carves
out
of
the
universe
of
remedies
that
our
legal
system
has
traditionally
thought
necessary
one
particular
or
one...
one
subset
of
that
relief
and
says
this
is
all
that's
available.
there
are
other
circumstances
erisa
by
virtue
of
a
broad
but
not
universal
preemption
in
which
plan
terms
are
not,
in
fact,
remediable.
when
beneficiaries
seek
medical
treatment
to
which
they're
guaranteed
under
the
terms
of
a
plan
and
don't
get
it
in
time
before
it
becomes
a
moot
point,
those
provisions
become
unenforceable.
it's
not
unheard
of
in
erisa.
now,
i
do
want
to
say
that
i
think
that
the
particular
interest
that
we're
talking
about
here,
the
plan's
interest
in
recourse
to
recover
money
that
ought
to
come
from
somebody
else...
namely
hyundai,
the
third-party
tortfeasor
or
alleged
third-party
tortfeasor...
i
think
need
not
be
viewed
as
unavailable.
i
think
that
preemption
law
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
rule
out,
in
particular,
the
plan's
suit
as
subrogee
in
state
court,
a
plain,
garden
variety
tort
suit--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that...
that--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i
think
that
this
court's
preemption
decisions,
as
i
read
them,
don't
make
that
impossible,
but
make
it
more
difficult.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i...
i
do
think
that
this
court's
preemption
decisions,
from
pilot
life
and
some
of
its
successors,
have
language
in
them
that,
taken
all
by
themselves,
might
suggest
that
any
contract
cause
of
action
on
the
same
subject
that
is
addressed
in
one
of
the
erisa
remedial
provisions
would
be
preempted.
each
of
those
cases,
in
fact,
involved
requests
for
greater
relief
than
was
made
available,
and
that
might
well
be
a
problem
for
the
kind
of
contract
action
you're
talking
about
here.
if
that
relief
is
legal
relief
and
it's
covered
by
502(a)(3)
as
a
subject
matter
and
congress
did
not
provide
for
it,
there
is
a
fairly
strong
inference
that
that
kind
of
relief
was
relief
that
congress
did
not
want
provided.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i...
i
don't
think
that
it,
in
the
end,
works
to
say
that
anytime
equitable
relief...
that
anytime
there's
no
legal
relief,
then
there
must
be
equitable
relief
because
then
i
think
we've
erased
the
distinction
congress
has
meant...
has
created.
i
do
think
the
subrogation
action
presents
a
much
easier
case,
indeed
a
case
that
ought
to
fall
outside
preemption
law.
it
has
not
been
the
case
under
erisa
and
it
has
not
been
the
case
under
the
labor
management
relation
act
section
301
provision
that
erisa
draws
on
that,
as
petitioners'
counsel
said,
every
suit
involving
interpretation
of
the
plan
is
preempted,
every
state
court
suit.
this
court,
for
example,
in
the
lingle
decision,
which
i
did
not
cite
in...
in
my
brief,
but
lingle
against
magic
chef
at
the
very
end
says
plan
interpretation...
or
i
guess
collective
bargaining
agreement
interpretation
in
the
301
context...
is
something
that
state
courts
can
do
as
an
adjunct
to
a
suit
where
the
elements
of
liability
and
the
duties
are
determined
otherwise.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i...
i
think
that
i
would
agree
with
petitioners
that
the
question
of
the
plan's
rights
are
matters
of
federal
law,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
possible
for
a
state
to
say
an
erisa
plan
that
does
provide
in
terms
for
subrogation,
stepping
into
the
shoes
of
the
beneficiary's
tort
claim...
i
don't
think
a
state
could
properly
deprive
the
plan
of...
of
that
right.
i
think
that
would
be
a
matter
of...
of
federal
law.
but
once
the
plan--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
don't
know
about
all...
all--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i...
i
guess
i...
i
should
say,
although
i
guess
it's
not
my
place
to
be
doing
a
lot
of
conceding
this
morning,
but
i
would
be
happy,
of
course,
if...
if
many
state
laws
were
not
preempted.
i
think
for
purposes
of
this
case
in
addressing
the...
the
concern
about
whether
plans
have
recourse,
a
very
narrow
question
is
presented,
and
that
is
whether
plan's
tort
suit
against
the
alleged
tortfeasor
is
preempted
because
not
in
determining
whether
the...
the
third-party
alleged
tortfeasor
violated
a
tort
duty
and
is
liable,
not
in
determining
the
amount
of...
of
overall
harm
caused,
but
rather,
in
deciding
whether
the
plan
can
be
there
as
a
plaintiff
and
what
portion
of
any
such
recovery
would
belong
to
the
plan,
those
essentially
ancillary
matters,
which
might
require
interpretation
of
the
plan...
those,
it
seems
to
me,
don't
get
preempted.
and
as
long
as
those
don't
get
preempted--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i...
i
don't
think
that
this
would
be
only
in...
in
state
courts
because
there
could
be...
i
mean,
the
interpretation
of...
of
many
plan
provisions
is
going
to
come
through
an
(a)(1)
action,
the
beneficiary
suing
for...
for
benefits.
there
may
be
specific
kinds
of
equitable
relief
that
is...
that
are
requested
that
would
fall
under
502(a)(3).
my...
my
point
is
that
there
is
no
reason
to
distort
what
i
think
is
the
natural
meaning
of
equitable
relief
based
on
an
admittedly
serious
concern
that
a
plan
might
not
have
recourse
for
money
because
i
think
the
plan
does
have
recourse
for
money
through
bearing
the
burden
of
pursuing
that
money
against
the
tortfeasor,
in
which
the
interpretation
of
the
plan
is
ancillary
and...
and
incidental
just
like
at
the
very
end
of
the
lingle
against
magic
chef
decision,
which
was
then
quoted
and
picked
up
again
in
the
livadas
decision
in
1994,
in
the
labor
contract
context.
state
courts
are
entitled,
despite
a
generally
very
broad
preemption
of
the
labor
contract
interpretation,
to
interpret
labor
contracts.
so
too
with
respect
to
the
plan
for
this
limited
role
for
subrogation.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i...
i...
if
i
can
say
it
slightly...
slightly
differently.
i
think
that
the
state
tort
law
is
the
claim...
creates
a
claim
for
negligence
and
any
damages
caused
by
that.
what
subrogation
does,
which
i
think
ought
to
be
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
which
probably
just
follows
the
terms
of
an
erisa
plan,
is
say
that
the
plan
can
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
beneficiary's
rights
under
state
law.
and
i
do
think
that
that
mode
of
proceeding
to
find
essentially
a...
to
find
a
recovery
out
of
money
that
in
justice,
according
to
petitioners,
ought
to
come
from
the
third-party
tortfeasor
is
available
in
state
court.
and
therefore,
a
principal
worry
about
adhering
to
what
i
think
is
the
natural
meaning
of
equitable
relief
in
(a)(2)...
in
(a)(3)
weakens
substantially.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the...
the
reason
that
i--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that
i
have
suggested
is
that
the
contract
action
between
the
plan
or
its
fiduciary,
which
the
cases
have
not
treated
as
identical,
but
the
contract
action
against
the...
against
the
beneficiary
to...
for
a
supposed
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
plan
feels
an
awful
lot
like
the
subject
matter
covered
directly
by
(a)(3).
and
if,
therefore,
that
contract
action
would
be
requesting
relief
that
could
only
really
be
legal
relief,
there
would
be
a
much
stronger
preemption
argument,
a
conflict
preemption
argument,
that
says
congress
really
did
say
we
want
equitable
relief,
we
don't
want
legal
relief,
and
that
would
be
a
stronger
preemption--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i...
i
think
we're
understanding
each
other,
and
i...
and
i
can
see
the
way
out
of
the...
the
stronger
preemption
argument
as
to...
as
to
that.
i
think
the
preemption
argument
as
to
the
subrogation
suit,
the
ordinary
tort
suit,
is
much,
much
weaker
to
begin
with
and
therefore
doesn't
require
as...
as
strong
a...
a
response.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i...
i
think
i'm
construing
it
in...
in
two
ways.
perhaps
as
narrowing,
but
more
importantly
as
clarifying
what
otherwise
would,
i
think,
be
the
more
reasonable
reading
of
(a),
the
enjoin
clause,
even
if
there
were
nothing
else.
i
think
the
more
reasonable
reading
would
be
injunctions
as
equity
made
them
available.
when
i
read...
what
your
first
comment
said,
if
all
that
was
there
was
the
enjoin
language,
i
think
that
language
by
itself
might
be
taken
to
mean
enjoin
any
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
plan.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
the
better
reading
even
without
the
language
that
follows,
but
i
think
the
language
that
follows
compels
adoption
of
that
because
it
characterizes
as
equitable
relief
the
injunctions
provided
for
in
the
first
clause.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
i...
i
have
reviewed
the...
the
legislative
history,
the
collective
three-volume
legislative
history,
and
as
i
think
some
of
this
court's
decisions
have...
have
indicated,
some
of
the
earlier
bills
contained
broader
relief
provisions,
legal
or
equitable
relief,
and
that
was
cut
back
for
reasons
that
at
least
i
don't
recall
having
seen.
in...
in
the
one
reference
to...
which
i
cited
in...
in
my
brief
i
think
at
page
27...
in
one
of
the
senate
reports
that
discusses
the
immediate
predecessor
of
this
provision,
there's
no
general
reference
to
any
kind
of
relief
that's
necessary
to...
to
make
plans
protect
all
of
their
rights
or
vice
versa.
it's
been
principally
a
beneficiary
protection
statute.
and
there's
also
no
general
reference
to
restitution
in
the
abstract.
there's
a
reference
to
injunctions
and
specifically
to
constructive
trusts.
so,
even
there,
there
isn't
a
general
idea
that
anytime
we're
talking
about
what
sometimes
are
called
direct
damages
or
general
damages
or
contractual
damages,
and
therefore
making
whole
the
loser
of
a
particular
sum
of
money
that's
been
promised,
that
that
action
would
somehow
be
transformed
into
an
equitable
action
when
historically
it
very
plainly
wasn't.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
let
me...
let
me
try
to
answer
that...
that
this
way.
this
court
has
never
said
that
for
the
important
constitutional
question,
that
back
pay
is
indeed
equitable
relief
for
seventh
amendment
purposes.
it
has
several
times
said
we
are
not
deciding
that
and
have
not
decided
that.
the
courts
of
appeals
have,
for
many
years,
in
fact
so
held.
but
if
you
look
back
at
the
original
decisions
that
so
held
back
in
the
1960's,
they
all
rested
on
something
that
is
suggested
directly
by
the
language
of
title
7,
which
is
not
that
back
pay
standing
alone
is
equitable
and
therefore
outside
the
jury
trial
right,
but
that
equity
always
had
the
power
to
award
money
when
incidental
to
and
intertwined
with
traditional
equitable
relief.
in...
in
the
context
of
title
7,
as
in
the
context
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
on
which
title
7
was
based,
back
pay
enters
not
as
a
separately
authorized
remedy,
but
as
reinstatement
with
or
without
back
pay.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
and...
and
i
agree
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have,
for
a
long
time,
treated
that
as
outside
the
jury
trial
right,
but
this
court
has
never
said
so.
and
perhaps
more
importantly
as
a
matter
of
congressional
intent,
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
in
1974,
when
writing
the
erisa
provision,
was
adopting
any
specialized
meaning
of
equitable
relief
that
congress
may
have
had
in
mind
in...
in
the
title
7
context.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
but
(b)...
(b)
does
quite
definitely,
as
harris
trust
indicates,
expand
beyond
injunctions
the
available
relief.
because
harris
trust,
after
all,
was
a
classic
form
of
restitution
where
the
money
that
was
being
sought
was
traceable.
it,
of
course,
doesn't
have
to
be
the
very
same
money.
it
can
be
either
money
commingled
with
other
funds
or
the
product
or
profits
from
it,
which
are
exactly
the
three
things
that
this
court
listed
in...
in
harris
trust.
that
wouldn't,
under
any
circumstance,
be
an
injunction,
but
it
would
be
a
traditionally
available
form
of
equitable
relief.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
whole
of
502(a)(3),
both
(a)
and
(b),
can
reach
beyond
the
limits
that
equity
made...
set
on
the
relief
that
the
court
of
chancery
would...
would
make
available.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i'm
sorry?
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i...
i
don't
think
so
because,
again,
textually
the
two
clauses
are
linked
by
the
word
other.
and
if
it
weren't
the
case,
then
again
a
plan
could
write
a
damages
provision
into
its...
into
itself
and
effectively
turn
(a)(3)
into
an
authorization
to
get
damages
by
saying
we're
just
seeking,
by
enjoining
the
promised
damages
that
you
cause,
an
injunction.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i...
i
guess
i...
i
find
the...
the
much
more
natural
reading
of
this
provision
in
the
context
of
(a)(2)
which
talks
about
equitable
and
other
remedial
relief
and
(g)(2)
which
talks
about
legal
and
equitable
relief
to
be
that
congress
in
(a)(3)
said
we
want
equitable
relief
available.
and
i...
i
take
it,
at
least,
that
a
specific
illustration
of
why
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
separate
those...
those
apart
even
aside
from
what
i
think
is
the
more
natural
textual
point
is
that
it
would
allow
the
plan
again
to
write
damages
provisions
into
their
terms,
the
plan's,
and
then
come
into
court
and
say,
we
want
an
injunction
for
the
beneficiary
to
pay
us
any
damages
that
are
caused
by...
by
some
act
because
that's
what--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--but
i'm
not
sure,
i
guess,
if...
if
a
plan
term
said
the
beneficiary...
i
mean,
i
think
this
could
go
either
way,
but
to
take--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--right,
right.
and
i...
and
i
think
that
that's...
that
that's
just
so
far
outside
any
recognizable
concept
of...
of
equitable
relief--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i...
i
guess
i...
i
would
say
that
it's...
it
is
a
better
reason
either
to
let
congress
alter
the
statute
if
unanticipated
problems
have...
have
arisen
or,
more
immediately,
to
make
sure
that
preemption
law
isn't
taken
to
an
extreme
that
precludes
what
i
think
is
the
more...
is
the
preferable
solution
anyway,
which
is
that
there
is...
by
the
very
terms
of
the
plan,
there's
an
intrinsic
reference
of
this
interest,
of
this
right,
to
an
underlying
state
court
suit.
it
is
preferable
from
a
systemic
point
of
view,
from
the
point
of
view
of
avoiding
the
extra
costs
of
duplicative
litigation,
of
avoiding
the
potential
conflict
between
federal
and
state
courts
on
either
the
very
same
or
closely
related
questions
for
there
to
be
a
single,
consolidated
proceeding
in
which
the
entire
question
gets
wrapped
up
who
is
supposed
to
get
the
single
pot
of
money.
there
may
be
special
reasons,
as
there
was
in
this
case,
where
the
state
court
is
probably
uniquely
entitled
to
create
the
special
needs
trust.
there
are
good
reasons
for
that
consolidated
state
court
proceeding
to
be
the
forum
where
the
plan
protects
this
interest,
and
preemption
law
i
think
very
readily
allows
the
plan
to
do
that.
as
long
as
there
is
that
outlet,
perhaps
even
under
mertens,
if
there
isn't
that
outlet,
but
as
long
as
there
is
that
outlet,
then
i
think
the
more
natural
reading
of
502(a)(3)
should
be
respected.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
those...
i...
i
agree
that
there
is...
that
there
are
certain
gaps
between
federal
and
state
law
that,
in
the
beneficiary
context,
have
become
all
but
commonplace
because
there
is
an
inference,
which
no
court
has
yet
figured
a
way
to...
to
supersede,
the
way
justice
breyer
was
talking
about,
that
when
beneficiary
relief
under
(a)(1)
is
limited
to
benefits,
it's
not
that
congress
has,
in
effect,
determined
that
damages
that
flow
from
violation
of
term
plans
to...
to
provide
necessary
medical
services
are
not
available.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
