mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
with
the
point
that
was
being
made
by
my
colleague,
which
is
that
this
is
the
only
mechanism
by
which
a
plan
can
enforce
a
term
of
the
plan.
this
is
equitable
relief
under
erisa.
it
can
be...
a
number
of
kinds
of
equitable
relief
are
available.
if
not
a
mandatory
injunction,
then
the
classic
forms
of
equitable
relief,
specific
enforcement
of
the
terms
of
a
plan--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--several
points--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--several
points,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
adequate
remedy...
there
is
no
adequate
or
certain
remedy
at
law
in
a
situation
like
this.
erisa
itself
does
not
provide
for
a
claim
of
money
damages.
and
it's
very
important
to
remember
we're
talking
about
whether
a...
a
term
of
the
plan
can
be
enforced.
there
is
a
strong
federal
policy
in
favor
of
some
mechanism
for
enforcement
of
the
term
of
the
plan.
now,
there's
no...
mertens
teaches
us
there's
no
federal
action
for
damages
based
on
a
violation
of
the
plan.
there
is
no
state
law
action
for
damages
for
a
violation
of
the
plan
because
this...
this
is
governed
exclusively
by
federal
law.
it
involves
the
construction
of
a
term
of
the
plan.
and
indeed,
if
the
plan
were...
if
the
plan
were
to
seek
an
action
for
damages
or
an
injunction
under
state
law,
that
would
be
deemed
completely
preempted
by
federal
law
under...
under
this
court's
previous
decisions.
so...
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
my
point,
justice
scalia,
is--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
if...
if
the
plan
provided...
it's
quite
possible
if
the
plan
provided,
for
example,
that
an
employer
would
make
a
contribution
to
the
plan,
to
ensure
that
the
plan
was
adequately
funded,
in
the
amount
of
$1,000
a
month
and
then
the
employer
refused
to
do
so,
it's
difficult
to
believe
congress
intended
that
there
be
absolutely
no
remedy
for
enforcement
of
such
a
central
term
of
the
plan
which
would
be
necessary
to
make
sure
that
the
plan
could
continue
in
existence.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--there
are...
there
are
in...
this
ties
to
one
of
justice
breyer's
points.
there
are
examples
under
which
courts
of
equity
would
enforce,
by
specific
enforcements,
contracts
to
pay
money.
and
these
are...
we've
cited
to
pomeroy,
and
there's
a
lengthy
footnote
in
that
page
at
pomeroy
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
examples,
contracts
to
pay
insurance,
contracts
to
pay
indemnity,
contracts
to
hold
harmless,
all
of
which
bear
a
strong
family
resemblance
to
the
kind
of
thing
we're
discussing--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--a
beneficiary
could...
could
sue
the
plan
under
502(a)--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
first
of
all,
even
if
the
beneficiary
sued
the
plan
under
502(a)(1)(b)
of
erisa,
that
is
a
federal
law
lawsuit.
so,
there's
no
question
that
still
federal
law
governs.
so,
there's
no
question
at
all
about
resorting
to
a
separate
corpus
of
state
law
to
interpret
the
plan.
second,
congress
for
various
reasons
said
that
the
beneficiary
could
sue
the
plan
in
state...
in
state
court.
it
did
not
provide
that
the
plan
could
sue
the
beneficiary
in
state
court.
erisa
is
quite
clear
that
that
has
to
be
in
federal
court.
there's
exclusive...
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
a
civil
action
brought
to
enforce
an
action
brought
by
a
fiduciary
for...
for
the
various
kinds
of
equitable
relief
set
forth
in
section
502(a)(3).
so,
for
one,
as
is
in
the
plan's
shoes,
it
is
equitable
relief
under
erisa
or
nothing.
and
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
it...
it
did
occur...
that
did
occur
to
me
in
the
last
hour,
mr.
chief
justice.
now...
now,
one
other
point.
the
complaint
does
say
for...
the
complaint
was
framed
when
the
money
had
not
yet
left
hyundai
and
was
framed
at
that
point
in
terms
of
a
prohibitory
injunction.
it
did
ask
for
such
other
equitable
relief
as
might
be
available.
and
there
are
classic
forms
of
equitable
relief
that
would
be
available,
restitution,
a
constructive
trust,
or
an
equitable
lien,
which
might...
any
number
of
which
might
be
applied
in
this
case
depending
on
who
might
be
the
appropriate
defendant
or
what...
what
theory
or
where
the
money
is
and
so
forth.
now--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--at
the
timing
of
the
suit,
i
think
there
would
have
been...
there
would
have
been
no
problem.
a
prohibitory
injunction
would
have
very
properly
been
issued
by
the
district
court
to
prevent
the
funds
in
the
settlement
from
being
disbursed
in
violation
of
the
plan,
which
is
how
(a)(3)(a)
is
framed.
and
there
is
a
res,
by
the
way.
it
may
not
be
money
that
came...
it
may
not
be
the
exact
same
dollars
that
came
from
the
plan,
but
the
settlement
check
and
the
amounts
that
are
derived
from
it
are
a
res
over
which
a
constructive
trust
might
properly
issue.
another
point
about
money
coming
from
the
plan.
in
harris
trust,
the
case
that
the
court
decided
a
couple
of
years
ago,
that
was
a
claim...
an
equitable
claim
for
restitution.
and
the
court
had
no
difficulty
with
concluding
that
such
an
equitable
claim
would
lie.
but
i
don't
think
anybody
thought
that
salomon
brothers,
which
had
participated
in
the
fiduciary
breach...
i
don't
think
anybody
thought
they
were
still
holding
the
same
dollars
that
they
had
obtained
by
participating
in
the
breach
of
the
fiduciary
duty.
i
mean,
it
was...
it
was
a
question
of
replacing
those
dollars,
and
that's...
and
that's
a
proper
application
of
the
equitable
remedy
of
restitution.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
don't
think
it
is
limited
by
(a)(3)(b)
that
says
appropriate
equitable
relief.
i
think--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
congress
can
simply
declare
that
black
is
white.
i
mean,
congress
cannot
simply
declare
that
something
is
an
injunction
which
isn't
really
an
injunction.
but
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
(a)(3)(a)
might
be
limited
to
prohibitory
injunctions
as
opposed
to
mandatory
injunctions,
but--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--but...
but
(3)...
but
(3)(b)(ii)
also
refers
to
enforcement
of
the
term
of
the
plan,
and
that...
that
is--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--(b)
little...
(b)(ii),
little
roman
ii,
refers
to
enforcement
of
the
term
of
the
plan
i
believe.
and
i
think
specific
enforcement
of
a
term
of
the
plan,
which
is
again
a
remedy
which
was
typically
available
in
a
court
of
equity,
would
classically
fall
under
that
situation
and
then
not--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--mr.
chief
justice,
i...
i
wouldn't
slice
it
that...
you
know,
that
closely.
enforcement
of
the
term
of
the
plan
very
often
might
require
an
order
in
the
nature
of
specific
enforcement
of
a
plan
that
might
not
fall...
if...
if
(a)(3)(a)
were
limited
to
prohibitory
injunctions,
i
think
(a)(3)(b)
would
be
there
to
remain.
and
as
the
court
pointed
out...
made
clear
in
harris
trust,
all
of
(a)(3)
is
really
kind
of
a
catchall
or
a
safety
net
kind
of
remedy
that's
there
to
ensure
that
plans
are
enforced
according
to
their
terms.
that
is
a
fundamental--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--policy
of
erisa.
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
congress
could
do
it,
but
i
don't...
i
mean,
congress
could
do
it.
but
i
think
an
ordinary
understanding
of
the
term
injunction...
it
doesn't
have
to
be
limited
to
a
specific
analog
that
a
court
of
equity
might
have
issued
in
1685,
and
congress
can
expand
the
court's
injunctive
power.
i
don't
think
that
congress
was
intending
to
say,
well,
it's
really
damages,
but
we'll
just
call
it...
call
it
an
injunction.
but
this
is
not--
