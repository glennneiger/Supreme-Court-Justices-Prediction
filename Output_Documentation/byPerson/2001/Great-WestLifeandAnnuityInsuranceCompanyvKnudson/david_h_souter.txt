okay.
that
doesn't...
that
doesn't
rule
out
equity.
but
take
the
case...
i
was
going
to
ask
you
a
question
similar
to
the
chief
justice's.
let's
assume
someone
has
signed
a
promissory
note,
and
on
the
date
the
promissory
note
becomes
due,
the
individual
is
entitled
to
an
inheritance
under
a
probate
court
decree.
would
equity
grant
an
injunction
at
the
behest
of
the
noteholder
against
using
the
inheritance
for
any
purpose
other
than
paying
the
note?
i
would
have
thought
not.
and
that
seems
to
be
very
similar
to
the
situation
that
you're
in
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
you're,
in
effect,
saying
that
(b)...
the
reference
to
equity
in
(b)
does
not
limit
the
breadth
of
the
authority
in
(a).
that's
your
real
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're...
you're
saying
that
given
the
timing
of
the
suit,
this
falls
literally
squarely
within
subsection
(a).
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're...
you're
using
the
word
other
as...
as
implying
in
(a)
a
limitation
of
(a)
to
only
those
instances
in
which
a
1750
or
whatever
court
of
equity
would
have
awarded
an
injunction.
but
isn't
there
another
way
of...
of
giving
some...
some
meaning
to
other
here?
and
that
is
to
say
that
other
was
referring
back
to
injunctions
which
(a)
refers
to
simply
as
a
generic
form
of
relief.
everybody
would
agree.
what...
what's
an
injunction?
a
legal
remedy
or
equitable
remedy?
sure,
it's
an
equitable
remedy.
and
the
only
thing
that...
that
other
is
referring
to
in
(b)
is
the
kinds
of
remedy.
it
doesn't
necessarily
imply
that
that
kind
of
remedy,
when
awarded
under
(a),
was
a...
was
a
remedy
only
in
those
instances
in
which
in
the
old
law
it
could
have
been
awarded.
so,
why
isn't
the...
the
generic
remedy
meaning
of
other
a
satisfactory
construction
which
then
leaves
the
courts
free
to
issue
any
kind
of
injunction
under...
under
(a)
to
enjoin
a
violation
of
the
plan?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but...
presumably,
under...
under
(a),
under
any
injunction
practice,
the...
the
court
would
require
proof
that
there
was
need
for
an
injunction
in
the
first
place.
in
other
words,
one
couldn't
simply
come
in
and
say,
gee,
they
might
violate
it,
so
give
us
an
injunction.
but
if
one
could
make
out
a...
a
case
in
the
first
instance
for
their
need...
of
a
need
for
the
injunction,
that
it
seems
to
me
would
answer
your
concern
that
it
could
be...
that
(a)
thereby
could
be
turned,
in
effect,
through
a
plan
provision
into
a
general
legal
remedy.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
going
to
take
it
one
step
further
and
say
you
can
always
get
an
injunction
under
any
circumstances
saying
pay
over
the
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
i
agree
but
i
think
it's
also
pretty
likely
outside
anything
that
congress
might
have
been
thinking
about
too.
isn't
it?
in
other
words,
the...
the
very
fact
that
congress
perhaps
didn't...
didn't
have
that
in
mind,
because
it
is
so
far-fetched,
is
a...
is
a
good
reason
to
read
(a)
as...
as
broadly
as
i'm
suggesting.
