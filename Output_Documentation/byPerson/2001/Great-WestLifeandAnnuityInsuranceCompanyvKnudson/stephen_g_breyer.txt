justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
that
clearly
wrong?
i
mean,
if
you
have
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
i
don't
think
you
can
issue
an
injunction.
what's
wrong
with
the
perfectly
adequate
remedy,
that
you
go
bring
a
suit
under
state
law?
you
attach
the
asset,
and
if
you
win,
you
get
the
money.
what's
inadequate
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
assume
it.
i
want
you...
i
say
why
isn't
it
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
and
if
it
is
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
go
into
a
court
of
equity
in
the
year
1750
where
they
really
knew
equity--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
guess
that
they
would
have
said,
i'm
not
going
to
issue
you
the
injunction
that
you
happened
to
get
here
because
you
have
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
and...
and
as
i
read
this,
i
can't
get
over
in
my
mind
that
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
that's
why
i
asked
you
the
question.
i'm
trying
to
get
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
know
many
constructive...
i'm
going
to
stop
you
because...
right
where
you're
going.
i've
found
many
cases
where
you
impose
a
constructive
trust
on
funds
that
go
out
of
the
trust
and
you
trace
those
funds.
but
i
can't
find
the
case...
and
you
may
be
able
to
get
me
one...
where
you
impose
a
constructive
trust
on
money
that
never
originated
from
a
trust
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this.
now,
maybe
if
you...
so,
in
your
answer
right
now,
maybe
you
can
cite
me
that
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
it
isn't
equitable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my...
my
book
of
restitution
says
sometimes
it's
equitable,
sometimes
it's
legal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
just
what
my
book
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
looked
up
every
one
of
those,
and
having
looked
up
every
one
of
them,
our
research
so
far
shows
that
there
is
no
category,
specific,
restitution,
anything
else,
that
this
would
count
as
equitable
because
in
each
instance,
they
would
have
said
that
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
and
there
is
no
basis
for
a
constructive
trust,
because
this
is
not
funds
that
come
out
of
the
trust.
rather,
it's
exactly
what
justice
souter
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
question
i
posed,
and
that's
what
i
would
like--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
key
to
this
is
your
statement
that
there
is
no
remedy
in
the
state
court
because
it's
interpreting
the
plan.
if
a
beneficiary...
can
a
beneficiary
sue
the
plan
in
state
court
where
interpretation
of
something
is
required?
is
there
some
kind
of
lawsuit
where
they
can
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
that
being
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because...
follow
me
because
it's
quite
important
to
me.
why
then
couldn't
you
say,
but
of
course
this
isn't
preempted,
of
course
the
right
remedy
is
the
state
court
remedy
for
damages,
and
of
course
in
that
situation
congress
intended
the
plan
to
be
able
to
sue
to
get
their
money
back,
and
whatever
interpretation
is
necessary
by
the
state
judge
is
fine?
why
can't
you
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
why
subrogee?
because
this
to
me
now
i'm
thinking,
having
listened
to
this,
is
a
key
point
to
me.
why
can't
the
plan
simply
bring
an
ordinary
contract
action
attaching
the
asset
in
state
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
does
it
have
to
be
a
subrogee?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
are
we
dealing
with
language
in
decisions
that
didn't
focus
on
this
circumstance?
because
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
congress
would
not
have
wanted
the
plan
to
be
able
to
sue
people
who
owed
them
money
including
beneficiaries.
after
all,
the
purpose
of
erisa
is
to
protect
the
assets
of
the
workers
in
plans.
so,
i'm...
i'm
quite
interested
if
you
can
say
anything
more
about
this
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
which...
which
would
be
the
easier
route?
if
i'm
convinced
that,
of
course,
congress
wants
the
plan
to
be
able
to
get
its
money
back,
legally
now
is
it
more
proper
to
say
it's
not
preempted
the
state
court
action,
ordinary
contract
with
attaching
the
assets?
or
is
it
more
legally
correct
to
say
there
is
no
state
court
action;
therefore,
there
is
no
adequate
remedy
at
law;
therefore,
an
action
close
to
restitution
or
specific
performance
lies?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i
see
that
except
for
one
point.
i
don't
see
why
you're
going
down
the
subrogation
route,
which
at
least
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
suggests
would
cause
a
lot
of
problems,
rather
than
simply
saying
it's
a
straight
contract
action
under
state
court...
under
state
law.
why?
what's
the...
you
have
a
reason
for
doing
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
which
point
you'd
say
that
congress
certainly
didn't
mean
they
can't
sue
people
to
get
money
belonging
to
the
plan.
we
have
the...
am
i
right?
i'm
trying
to...
it's
a
kind
of
circle,
and
i'm
trying
to
see
if
i
have
the...
all
the
parts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
couldn't
you
have
historically
gotten--
