justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you
say
to
enjoy
any
act
or...
do
you
think
that
includes
to
enjoin
your
refusing
to
pay
me
money
that
you
owe
me?
because
it
doesn't
just
say
to
enjoin.
it
says,
to
enjoin
any
act
or
practice,
or
(b)
to
obtain
other...
other...
appropriate
equitable
relief.
so,
i...
you
know,
i
take
that
to
mean
an
injunction
that
is
a
normal
equitable
injunction,
an
injunction...
an
injunction
that
is
equitable
relief.
and...
and
that
puts
the
burden
on
you
to...
to
show
that
refusing
to
pay
me
money
that
you
owe
me
can
be
enjoined
in
equity,
which
i
don't
think
it
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
want
to
talk
about
purpose,
i
frankly
don't
see
why
it
is
in
accord
with
the
purpose
to
limit
the
relief
to
equitable
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
if
the
only
way
to
get
the
relief
is
at
law,
the
purpose
of
the
act
would...
would
allow
you
to
get
relief
at...
at
law.
but...
but
the
act
chose
not
to
go
that
far.
it
just
says,
you
know,
to
enjoin
any
act
or
to
obtain
other
appropriate
equitable
relief.
so,
you
don't
think
the
injunction
portion,
to
enjoin
any
act
or
practice,
refers
to
normal
equitable
injunction.
it
could
be...
it's
a
type
of
injunction
that
would
not
have
been
available
in
equity.
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
you
say
that...
that
under
this,
since
it's
exclusively
federal
causes
of
action
and
since
the
federal
statute
does
not
provide
for
any
legal
remedy,
that
any
so-called
equitable
remedy
is
available
because
there
is
no
legal
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that...
is
that
your
point?
so,
you
could
bring
an
injunction...
if
a
plan
provided
that
somebody
would
pay
a
lump
amount
of
cash
to
the
plan
on
a
certain
day,
you
could
bring
an
injunction
to
prevent
that
person
from
failing
to
pay
the
lump
amount
of
cash.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wolfson,
i...
i
want
to
be
clear
about
the
government's
position.
the
government's
position
is
that
if
you're
under
(a)(3)(a),
it
must
be
a
classic
equitable
injunction
that
you're
seeking?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
rather,
it
doesn't
matter?
in
which
case,
i
don't
know
why
you're
going
into
all
of
this.
is
the
government's
position
that
under
(a)(3)(a)
you
can
enjoin
any
act
that
is
in
violation
of
commitments
made
under
the
plan?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so,
whether...
whether
it
would
be
an
ordinary
injunction
that
a
court
of
equity
would
give
out
or
not,
you...
or
courts
have
the
power
to
enjoin.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
because
it
says
enjoin
any
act,
not...
not
any
failure
to
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
think...
do
you
think
an
injunction
can
issue
under
(b)?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
would
you
enforce
a
liquidated
damages
provision,
assuming
a
plan
has
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
there's
a
lot
of
stuff
that's...
that's
permissible
under
erisa
that
is
simply
not
enforceable
in
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
other
state
restrictions
on
contracting
are
overridden
simply
because
it's
an
erisa
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
provisions
for
excessive
punitive
damages?
i
mean,
there
are
all
sorts
of
state
provisions
for
contract
law.
they're...
they're
all
to
be
set
aside
once...
once
you
have
an
erisa
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent,
janette
knudson,
was
rendered
quadriplegic
by
a
car
accident.
the
employee
health
plan
of
her
employer,
petitioner
earth
systems,
inc.
covered
about
$411,000
of
her
medical
expenses.
the
plan
includes
a
reimbursement
provision
that
is
the
basis
of
this
action.
this
provides
the
plan
with
the
right
to
recover
from
a
beneficiary
any
payment
for
benefits
paid
by
the
plan
that
the
beneficiary
is
entitled
to
recover
from
a
third
party.
janette
and
her
then-husband,
respondent
eric
knudson,
brought
a
state
law
tort
action
against
the
manufacturer
of
the
car
involved
in
the
accident
and
other
alleged
tortfeasors.
the
parties
to
that
action
negotiated
a
$650,000
settlement
which
allocated
about
$14,000,
the
portion
of
the
settlement
attributable
to
past
and
medical
expenses
to
satisfy
the
plan’s
claim
of
$411,000.
instead
of
cashing
the
check
for
that
amount
however,
the
petitioner
great-west
life
and
annuity
insurance
company,
the
insurer
for
the
plan
which
had
paid
janette’s
medical
expenses
and
thereby
assignee
of
the
plan’s
rights
under
the
reimbursement
provision,
filed
this
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california
seeking
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
under
section
502(a)(3)
of
erisa
to
enforce
the
reimbursement
provision
by
requiring
the
knudsons
to
pay
$411,000
of
any
proceeds
recovered
from
third
parties.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
knudsons
and
was
affirmed
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
ground
that
judicially
decreed
reimbursement
for
payments
made
to
a
beneficiary
of
an
insurance
plan
by
a
third
party
is
not
equitable
relief,
and
is
therefore
not
authorized
by
502(a)(3).
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
affirm.
section
502(a)(3)
authorizes,
among
other
things,
a
civil
action
by
a
fiduciary
“(a)
to
enjoin
any
act
or
practice
which
violates
the
terms
of
the
plan
or
(b)
to
obtain
other
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
redress
such
violations
or
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan.”
we
held
in
a
case
called
mertens
versus
hewitt
associates
that
the
term
equitable
relief
in
section
502(a)(3)
must
refer
to
“those
categories
of
relief
that
were
typically
available
in
equity.”
here,
petitioners
seek
in
essence
to
impose
personal
liability
on
respondents,
the
knudsons,
for
a
contractual
obligation
to
pay
money,
relief
that
was
not
typically
available
in
equity.
indeed,
a
claim
for
money
due
and
owing
under
a
contract
is
quintessentially
an
action
at
law.
we
are
not
persuaded
by
petitioners’
attempts
to
characterize
the
relief
they
seek
as
equitable.
first,
petitioners
argue
that
they
are
entitled
to
relief
because
they
seek
to
enjoin
respondents
from
failing
to
reimburse
them
in
violation
of
the
plan.
however,
an
injunction
to
compel
the
payment
of
the
money
passed
due
under
a
contract
or
specific
performance
of
a
past
due
monetary
obligation
was
not
typically
available
in
equity.
those
rare
cases
in
which
a
court
of
equity
would
decree
specific
performance
of
a
contract
to
transfer
funds
or
suits
which
unlike
the
present
case,
sought
to
prevent
future
losses
were
either
incalculable
or
would
be
greater
than
the
sum
awarded.
second,
petitioners
argued
that
their
suit
is
authorized
by
502(a)(3)(b)
because
they
seek
restitution
which
they
characterized
as
a
form
of
equitable
relief.
however,
not
all
relief
falling
under
the
rubric
of
restitution
is
available
in
equity.
plaintiff
who
asserted
no
title
or
right
to
possession
of
particular
property
but
merely
sought
money
to
pay
for
some
benefit
the
defendant
had
receive
from
him
had
a
right
to
restitution
at
law
through
an
action
derived
from
the
common-law
writ
of
assumpsit.
in
contrast,
the
plaintiff
could
seek
restitution
in
equity
ordinarily
in
the
form
of
a
constructive
trust
or
an
equitable
lean
only
where
money
or
property
identified
as
belonging
in
good
conscience
to
the
plaintiff
could
clearly
be
traced
to
particular
funds
or
property
in
the
defendant’s
possession.
here,
the
funds
to
which
petitioner's
claim
an
entitlement
under
the
plan’s
reimbursement
provision,
namely
the
proceeds
from
the
settlement
are
not
and
have
never
been
in
the
knudsons’
possession.
the
disbursements
from
the
settlement
were
paid
by
two
checks,
one
made
payable
to
a
special
needs
trust
created
under
california
law
for
janette’s
care,
and
the
other
to
respondent’s
attorney
who,
after
deducting
his
own
fees
and
costs,
paid
the
remaining
funds
to
respondent’s
other
creditors.
the
kind
of
restitution
that
petitioners
seek
therefore,
is
not
equitable,
but
legal.
we
note
in
the
opinion
that
there
may
have
been
other
means
for
petitioners
to
obtain
the
legal
relief
that
they
seek
but
respecting
congress’
choice
to
limit
the
relief
available
under
502(a)(3)
to
equitable
relief
requires
us
to
recognize
the
sometimes
recondite
differences
between
law
and
equity
to
which
the
statute
refers.
because
petitioners
are
seeking
relief
that
is
essentially
legal
502(a)(3)does
not
authorize
this
action
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter
and
breyer
have
joined.
