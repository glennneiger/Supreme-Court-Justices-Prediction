mr.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
w-
you
you've
presented
three
questions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
number
of
cases,
going
back
fifty
years,
that
if
you're
talking
about
an
a
unreasonable
rate
of
return
or
a
taking
or
something
that
has
constitutional
implications,
you
you
can't
attack
the
method
because
different
methods
can
work
out
differently.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they're
probably
going
to
be
set
by
by
state
commissions,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
aren't
these
costs
and
fees
going
to
be
ultimately
set
by
state
commissions
applying
the
fcc
rules?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
the
cases
say
you
can't
do,
it
seems
to
me,
going
back
to
the
j-
stone's
opinion
fifty
years
ago,
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
duquesne,
that
you
can't
attack
the
methodology
unless
you
can
point
to
some
something
wrong
in
the
actual
fee
that
you're
allowed
or
the
rate
that
you're
allowed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
numerous
cases
have
said
that
m-
he-
his,
th-
the
ratemaking
agency
is
not
required
to
follow
histor-
to
adopt
historical
costs
as
the
method
of
fixing
rat-
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
true
of
any
utility
in
those
cases
that
we've
we've
decided
over
the...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
who
is
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
but
you're
you're
saying
rule
seven
oh
two
prevents
you
from
ge-
getting
back
what
you
otherwise
should
have
through
capital
costs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
w-
what
language
in
rule
seven
oh
two
are
you
relying
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
page
eighty-three
a,
toward
the
end
of
seven,
r-
rule
seven
oh
two,
it
says,
state
states
may
adjust
the
cost
of
capital
if
a
party
demonstrates
to
a
state
commission
that
either
a
higher
or
lower
level
of
cost
of
capital
is
warranted
without
the
commission
conducting
a
rate
of
return
or
other
rate-based
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
language
i
just
quoted
to
you?
how
do
you
distinguish
that
if
you
don't
if
you
don't
agree
with
me?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
w-
o-
or
or
the
or
the
state
prescr-
was
this
last
part,
or
the
state
prescribed
rate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but,
what
part
of
footnote
eight
are
you
relying
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
here
no
property
is
taken
in
the
condemnation
sense
of
the
word.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i-
i
don't
think
it
comes
under
the
just
compensation
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

well,

barr.
