mr.
william
p.
barr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
start
with
a
brief
illustration
that
i
think
will
help
crystallize
the
legal
issues,
both
the
so-called
forward-looking
issues
and
the
historical
cost
issues.
the
illustration
itself
self
starts
with
a
forward-looking
perspective.
now,
any
firm
that
operates
and
builds
a
network
incurs
three
costs
going
forward.
let's
say
i,
the
hypothetical
new
entrant
capable
of
coming
in
today
and
instantaneously
deploying
the
most
efficient
network
possible
today,
i
would
have
to
expend
my
baseline
facility
costs.
and
let's
say
the
fcc
is
right.
let's
say
that
costs
about
a
hundred
and
eighty
billion
dollars
to
reproduce
the
system
today
from
scratch.
then
i
would
face
my
operating
costs
that
are
dictated
by
the
network
that
i
just
built.
let's
say
those
are
seventy-five
billion
dollars
a
year.
and
then
i
would
face
the
incremental
capital
investment
that
i
would
make
each
year
to
upgrade
and
expand
the
network.
let's
say
that's
thirty
billion
dollars
a
year.
now,
let
me
show
why
under
telric
no
firm
that
actually
makes
expenditures
can
recover
them.
mr.
william
p.
barr
the
seventy-five
is
operating
costs...
mr.
william
p.
barr
dictated
by
the
network...
per
year?
per
y-
mr.
william
p.
barr
that
i've
deployed.
mr.
william
p.
barr
per
year,
which
is
how
much
our
operating
costs
are
per
year.
mr.
william
p.
barr
no.
mr.
william
p.
barr
yes.
mr.
william
p.
barr
that's
the
sunk
capital...
mr.
william
p.
barr
yeah.
mr.
william
p.
barr
i'm
going
to
show
it's
devoted
to
all
three,
and
i'm
going
to
show
how
telric
does
not,
going
forward,
permit
the
recovery
because
it
bases
compensation,
for
someone
who
has
already
expended
money
on
the
network,
on
the
imaginary
cost
structure
of
a
hypothetical
entrant
who
can
be
unconstrained
and
who's
capable,
at
any
given
time,
of
instantaneously
deploying
and
ubiquitously
deploying
a
brand
new
network
that's
the
most
efficient
at
that
point.
mr.
william
p.
barr
well
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
the
court
has
done
is
made
distinctions
between
ends
and
means.
mr.
william
p.
barr
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
william
p.
barr
the
rates
themselves
will
be
set
by
by
the
state
commissions,
implementing
a
methodology,
and
we
are
complaining
about...
mr.
william
p.
barr
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
has
always
reviewed
methodologies.
mr.
william
p.
barr
well,
if
if
the
if
if
we
are
correct
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
fair
opportunity
to
recover
our
costs,
and
the
government
decides
that
they're
going
to
spin
a
roulette
wheel,
i
can't
come
in
and
say
that's
a
problem?
that
exposes
me
to
risk?
the
reason
we
have
why
do
we
have
methodologies
set
in
the
first
place
instead
of
later
r-
instead
of
later
proceedings
that,
we
have
them
to
set
up
front
a
promise
to
pay
that
sets
investor
expectations
and
ensures
that
the
users,
not
the
government,
is
going
to
end
up
footing
the
bill.
mr.
william
p.
barr
that's
the
method,
but
the
objective
has
to
be
an
opportunity
of
getting
me
back
my
costs.
mr.
william
p.
barr
no.
mr.
william
p.
barr
the
reason
we
have
methodologies
and
the
reason
i'm
entitled
to
know
that
i
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
recover
it
is
that
i
shouldn't
be
forced
to
spend
money,
to
lay
out
money
unless
i
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
get
it...
mr.
william
p.
barr
well,
actually,
y-
you
know,
we
do
know
whether
it's
so.
mr.
william
p.
barr
there
are
two
reasons.
mr.
william
p.
barr
yes.
mr.
william
p.
barr
there
are...
mr.
william
p.
barr
right.
mr.
william
p.
barr
in
in
the
duquesne
case,
the
court
said
even
a
small
shift
in
methodology
warrants
a
p-
an
increase
in
the
risk
of
premium
because
you
are
always
entitled
to
get
pay
for
wh-
to
whatever
risk
you're
exposed
to.
mr.
william
p.
barr
th-
the
problem
here
i-
i-
the
problem
here
in
this
order...
mr.
william
p.
barr
th-
the
the
decision
took
place
in
the
federal
proceeding,
and
it
took
place
in
paragraph
six
eighty-eight
and
seven
oh
two
of
the
order.
mr.
william
p.
barr
joint
appendix
three
eighty-five
three
eighty-six
and
joint
appendix
three
ninety-five.
mr.
william
p.
barr
the
s-
the
the
issue
here
is
the
cost
of
capital
in
the
une
business,
our
wholesale
business.
mr.
william
p.
barr
well,
your
honor,
it
it
it
it
does
say
that
y-
you
use
you
start
with
the
the
current
rate
of
return
and
the
current
depreciation.
mr.
william
p.
barr
it
says
that
we
bear
the
burden
in
the
state
proceedings
of
showing
a
business
risk,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
business
risk
relates
to
actual
competition.
mr.
william
p.
barr
yeah.
mr.
william
p.
barr
they
don't.
mr.
william
p.
barr
the
fcc...
mr.
william
p.
barr
okay.
mr.
william
p.
barr
no,
because
the
thing
they're
depreci-
the
thing
they're
depreciating
is
the
telric
price.
mr.
william
p.
barr
their
briefs
talk
about
cost
of
capital.
mr.
william
p.
barr
they
allow
the
cost
of
capital
that
exists
in
a
closed
market.
mr.
william
p.
barr
the
rule
says
no.
mr.
william
p.
barr
but
but
if
you
change
the
rule,
mr.
william
p.
barr
you
theoretically
could
do
a
high
enough
rate
of
return.
mr.
william
p.
barr
okay.
mr.
william
p.
barr
asked
i-
i,
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
william
p.
barr
yes.
mr.
william
p.
barr
that
the
s-
that
the
existing
rate
of
return
and
existing
depreciation
are
reasonable
starting
points.
mr.
william
p.
barr
starting
point.
mr.
william
p.
barr
actual
competition.
mr.
william
p.
barr
yes.
mr.
william
p.
barr
but
it
is
a
separate
order.
mr.
william
p.
barr
we
recognize
that
incumbent
lecs
are
likely
to
face
increased
risks
given
the
overall
increases
in
competition
in
the
industry,
which
might
warrant
an
increased
cost
of
capital.
mr.
william
p.
barr
that
paragraph
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
that
paragraph
and
the
way
it
is
read
and
applied...
mr.
william
p.
barr
i
would
distinguish
it
by
then
looking
at
the
rule,
which
is
rule
five
oh
five,
and
that's
on
joint
appendix
fifty-one
and
fifty-two.
mr.
william
p.
barr
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
barr
that's
right,
and
that's
a...
mr.
william
p.
barr
that's
a
directive
to
the
state.
mr.
william
p.
barr
it
binds
yes,
it
does
bind
them.
mr.
william
p.
barr
the
rate...
mr.
william
p.
barr
the
the
the
they
cannot
consider
in
se-
in
setting
the
cost
of
capital
historical
costs.
mr.
william
p.
barr
and
how
do
they
determine
h-
what's
high
enough...
mr.
william
p.
barr
well,
i
think,
you
know,
y-
your
concurrence
in
in
in
duquesne,
justice
scalia,
made
a
v-
very
fundamental
point,
which
is
you
can't
talk
about
return
on
risk
without
implying
a
standard.
mr.
william
p.
barr
be
able
to
recover
my
capital.
mr.
william
p.
barr
looking
at
what
my
capital
is
in
relation
to
what
you're
allowing...
mr.
william
p.
barr
that
was
mixing
the
apples
and
oranges.
mr.
william
p.
barr
correct.
mr.
william
p.
barr
t-
well,
by
using
the
same
depreciation
schedule...
mr.
william
p.
barr
and
hypothesizing
a
new
network,
mr.
william
p.
barr
that
reduces
my
e-
my,
that
reduces
my
capital
charge.
mr.
william
p.
barr
no.
mr.
william
p.
barr
five
years
i
have
to
buy
a
new
switch,
and
i
strand
what
i
haven't
yet
recovered.
mr.
william
p.
barr
the,
well,
yes.
mr.
william
p.
barr
the,
yes.
mr.
william
p.
barr
depreciation...
mr.
william
p.
barr
yes.
mr.
william
p.
barr
this
is
a
separate
proceeding,
mr.
william
p.
barr
their
application
of
telric.
mr.
william
p.
barr
in
the
universal
service.
mr.
william
p.
barr
paragr-
paragraph
two
fifty
of
that
order.
mr.
william
p.
barr
joint
appendix,
but
it's
a
pub-
i-
it's
the
parallel
proceeding
to
this
where
they
were
setting
telric
for
our
universal
service
prices.
mr.
william
p.
barr
i-
it
has
to
be
either
the
federal
interstate,
that's
a
retail
rate.
mr.
william
p.
barr
state's
prescribed
rate
of
return
for
intrastate
intrastate
services.
mr.
william
p.
barr
well,
the
next
paragraph,
paragraph
five,
says
that
we
agree
with
those
commentators
that
argue
that
currently
authorized
lives
should
be
used
because
the
high
cost
areas
are
unlikely
to
face
a
serious
competitive
threat.
mr.
william
p.
barr
that
second
consideration
is
notwithstanding
the
incumbent's
contrary
suggestion
implicit
in
any
determination
of
the
true
economic
cost
of
capital.
mr.
william
p.
barr
make
up
a
value...
mr.
william
p.
barr
no,
that's
wrong
in
two
respects.
mr.
william
p.
barr
percent
of
our
lines
have
been
taken
in
this
respect.
mr.
william
p.
barr
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree
because
i
think
that
the
reason
wh-
w-
when
you
dedicate
property
and
there's
a
taking,
the
reason
the
government
has
to
come
up
with
a
methodology
to
pay
is
precisely
because
it
has
to
promise
to
pay
at
the
point
of
the
dedication.
mr.
william
p.
barr
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
barr
right,
a-
a
return
in
order
to
give
us
a
fair
opportunity
to
get
our
money
back.
mr.
william
p.
barr
these
use
the
same
facilities.
mr.
william
p.
barr
well,
yes,
but
it's,
that's
like
going
to
gm
and
saying
give
away
your...
mr.
william
p.
barr
n-
no.
mr.
william
p.
barr
not
in
the
context,
i-
y-
you
have
cost
and
you
have
value
methodologies.
mr.
william
p.
barr
constitution
doesn't
dictate
a
methodology,
but
what
t-
it
does
say
is
that
whatever
methodology
is
selected,
it
ultimately
has
to
be
judged
by
this
court
as
to
whether
it
provides
us
a
fair
opportunity
to
recover
our
costs.
