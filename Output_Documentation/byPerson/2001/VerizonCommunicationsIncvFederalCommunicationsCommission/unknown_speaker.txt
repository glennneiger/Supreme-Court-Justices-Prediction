but
but...
unknown

well,
because
we're
not
com-,
well,
unknown

in
the

unknown
speaker
no,
i
don't.
but
there
are...
unknown

rates,
unknown

no.
you
wouldn't.
you
wouldn't
concede
that.
unknown

in

there
are
two

on

there

no.
the

the

they

telric...
unknown

they
take,
excuse

unknown

right?
unknown

right.
unknown

problem.
unknown
speaker
i
had
also...
unknown
speaker
paragraph...
unknown
speaker
by
the
fcc...
unknown
speaker
there?
unknown
speaker
where?
what's
the
language?
unknown
speaker
starting...
unknown

yeah,

ninety-
unknown
speaker
yes.
in
fact,
they've
admitted
it
in
their
brief.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
in
the
record,
unknown
speaker
as
if
there's
instantaneous
entry.

but
isn't

okay.

but
that
is
not...

the
rate
cannot...
unknown

but
they
don't
have
to...
unknown
speaker
how
do
they
determine
what's
high
enough,
your
honor?
unknown
speaker
you're
going
to
be...
unknown
speaker
unless
you
have
a
standard?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
very...
unknown
speaker
it's
the
risk
i'm
not
going
to...
unknown
speaker
but
now,
i'm
sorry.
in...
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so,
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
on
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
because
in...
unknown
speaker
by
that?
unknown
speaker
can
can...
unknown
speaker
if,
this
is...
unknown
speaker
but
it's...
unknown
speaker
the
rate
of
return
must
either
be...
unknown
speaker
it's
published
opinion,
but
it's
not
part
of
the
record.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
retail

the
retail
rate.
yes.
unknown
speaker
there...
unknown
speaker
on
the...
unknown
speaker
costs.
you
can't
just...
unknown
speaker
for
it.
unknown
speaker
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
have
they
done
so?
w-
is...
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i-
i-
unknown
speaker
compensation
clau-
unknown
speaker
and
this
takes
us...
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
every
time...
unknown
speaker
taking.
unknown
speaker
return.
that
was
the
deal.
unknown
speaker
this.
unknown
speaker
but
you're...
unknown
speaker
chevys
because
you're
still
making
money.
unknown
speaker
reasonably...
unknown
speaker
techniques.
unknown
speaker
well
there
might
be,
there...
unknown
speaker
you
can't
meet
that
burden
with
a
wheel.
you're
really
saying
that...
unknown

that...
unknown

be
based
upon
the

unknown
speaker
agree.
unknown
speaker
are
actual
are

unknown
speaker
what's
ultimately
reasonable?
unknown

duquesne
case.
unknown
speaker
paragraph...
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
says...
unknown
speaker
utility
has.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
care
if
it's
required
by
the
s-
unknown
speaker
capital
that
they've
invested,
unknown
speaker
because...
unknown
speaker
that
they
get
a
fair
return.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
it...
unknown
speaker
taken
into
account.
unknown
speaker
in
footnote...
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
provision
that
shows
where
that
will
be
taken
into
account
a
fair
at
all.
is
it...
unknown
speaker
written.
unknown
speaker
let's
just
take...
unknown
speaker
let's
just
take...
unknown
speaker
to
these
services.
unknown
speaker
case.
unknown
speaker
so,
you...
unknown
speaker
giving
co-
unknown
speaker
the
local
exchange...
unknown
speaker
what...
unknown
speaker
but
we
refused...
unknown
speaker
exclusive.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
they're...
unknown
speaker
also...
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
confiscatory?
unknown
speaker
to
allow
someone
else
to
use
it.
unknown
speaker
competition...
unknown
speaker
well,
they...
unknown
speaker
deal
in
some
generality,
this
area
does.
but
one
of...
unknown
speaker
right,
unknown
speaker
question?
unknown
speaker
fine.
okay.
now,
that's
what-
all
right,
then
you're
right
where
i
think
you...
unknown
speaker
partial
dissent...
unknown
speaker
methodologies...
unknown
speaker
then
we
can
adjudicate
that.
all
right.
now,
unknown
speaker
exist?
unknown
speaker
we
could
never
compete
using
irrelevance...
unknown
speaker
to
uphold
them.
i
mean,
that's...
unknown
speaker
and
if
you're
going
to...
unknown
speaker
capital
are
set.
unknown
speaker
the
risks
of
operating
in
the
system.
so,
i
think
it...
unknown
speaker
if
if
that
that...
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
take
it...
unknown
speaker
basically
his
point.
unknown
speaker
to...
unknown
speaker
telephone
service.
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
but
there's
a
significant,
i
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
unknown
speaker
for
years
and
years.
unknown
speaker
it,
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
