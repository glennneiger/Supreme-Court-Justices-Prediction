but
your
your
point
there
the
answer
justice
scalia's
question,
i
take
it,
was
forgetting
your
first
problem
that's
your
first
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
one
you
brought
up
at
the
beginning.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
they're
pretending
actual
competition
is
what
makes
the
difference,
but
what
the
problem
arises
out
of
is
the
fact
that
they're
pricing
on
a
hypothetically
perfectly
competitive...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
point
were
wrong,
then
the
answer
to
justice
scalia,
i
take
it,
would
be,
there's
no
other
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
r-
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
may
all
be
true,
and
i
have
only
one
question
to
ask,
and
it
be
and
i'm
asking
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you're
saying
is
in
response
to
what
i
said,
that
i
am
wrong
in
saying
that
the
telric
set
depreciation,
capital
return,
and
other
numbers,
i
am
wrong
in
saying
that
they
will
earn
you
a
fair
rate
of
return
on
a
hundred
and
forty
billion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
can
find
that
in
the...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mhm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mhm...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
capital
charge
will
fall
from
a
hundred
and
forty
billion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
a
chance
to
ask
you
a
different
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
like
a
little
bit
less
generality
than
that,
i-
if
if
i-
w-
i-
i-
if
you
can
give
it
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
basically
the
objective,
to
get
them
to
enter
when
they
should
enter,
is
that
fair?
to
get
them
to
enter
when
economically
they
should
enter,
not
when
economically
it'd
be
wasteful
for
them
to
enter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
what
they're
trying
to
do,
then
how
could
it
possibly
do
that,
to
write
an
order
that
says
the
depreciation
rate
and
the
rate
of
return
that
you
are
going
to
charge
is
going
to
be
based
upon
not
what
it
will
cost
you,
but
rather,
what
it
will
cost
some
hypothetical
firm
that
isn't
there,
let
alone
saying
the
same
thing
in
respect
to
telephone
poles,
in
respect
to
wires,
in
respect
to
efficiency
of
administration,
in
respect
to
a
twenty-two
percent
discount
for
a
competition
that
doesn't
exist?
in
other
words,
how
does
it
even
come
close
to
answering
that
question
to
look
not
at
the
cost
of
this
firm,
but
at
the
cost
of
some
hypothetical
firm
that
by
definition
doesn't...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
blank
slate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
basically
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
u-
my
question,
i
don't
want
to
distract
you
because
others
had
a
different
question
had
nothing
to
do
with
confiscation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
assuming
that,
w-
his
ar-
mr.
barr's
argument,
i
take
it,
was
that
paragraph
seven
oh
two
put
read
in
any
disclaimers
you
want,
and
they
have
loads
of
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
may
not
have
paraphrased
it
correctly,
but
i
think
that's...
