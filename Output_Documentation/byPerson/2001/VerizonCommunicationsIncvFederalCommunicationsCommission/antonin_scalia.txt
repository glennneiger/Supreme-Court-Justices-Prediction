that's

cost.
justice

just
a

it's
i
mean,
but
there's
always
a
risk,
i
suppose,
until
you
get
the
final
determination
by
whoever
the

is.
justice

you
you
don't
concede
that
necessity,
do
you?

otherwise,
you
would

compensation,
it

b-
if
if
all
of
that
is
true
and
you're
exposed
to
so
much
greater

i
assume
that
your

will
be
much
higher.
justice

can
you
get

back
in

what

gee.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
justice
antonin

consider
it
if
they
give
you
a
high
enough
rate
on
your
telric
costs.
justice
antonin
scalia
past
costs
were,
indeed,
ten
million,
and
they're
saying,
well,
it's
just
five
because
somebody
else
could
do
it
for
five
if
they
came
in

now.

it's

don't
you
have
the

of
showing

this

at

justice

you
you
can't
meet

with
with
with

you
can

up

just
say,
well,
you
know,
you
can't
prove
that
you're
not

that

this

some

you
can
come
up

say,
it's
always
been
so
difficult.
justice

you've
departed
from
my
from
my
hypothesis,
i'm

i
don't

that
spinning

is
okay.
justice

telling
me

spinning

okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
say
that
you
don't
constitutionalize
the
prudent
investment
rule
is
not
to
say
that
any
methodology
will
go,
even
one
that
does
not
enable
somebody
who
has
made
investments
under
a
commitment
from
the
government
to
allow
a
fair
return,
to
recover
that
fair
return.
justice
antonin
scalia
confiscatory
to
say
that
we're
going
to
make
you
use
your
capital
plant,
which
costs
a
hundred
and
forty
billion,
and
we're
going
to
allow
you
to
depreciate
it
as
though
it
were
only
seventy
billion?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
asserting
that
the
states
can
can
kick
up
the
cost
of
capital
rate
on
the
basis
of
u-
of
the
fact
that
the
utility
is
not
is
not
getting
depreciation
on
its
sunk
costs.
