mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
the
c-,
this
court
has
said
that
the
challenger
of
a
rate
has
a
heavy
burden
to
make
a
convincing
case
that
the
outcome
is
confiscatory.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
the
the
person
who
challenges
the
way
the
commission
is
setting
rates
has
to
deter-
has
to
present
to
this
court
a-
an
explanation
for
why
that
the
system
that's
developed,
wheth-
whether
it's
spinning
a
wheel
or
whatever
and
i
i
i
won't
engage
in
that
c-
hypothetical
because
we've
got
a
several
hundred
page
record
that
looked
into
various
different
arguments
with
respect
to
various
different
methods
of
recovery.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
no,
i
don't...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
no,
it
it
does
not
have
to
be.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
by
the
circumstances
and
and
the
constitutional
obligation
to
set
a
reasonable
rate
under
the
statute
considering
this
methodology
and
limited
by
the
constitutional
standard
that
this
court
has
articulated
as
the
lowest
reasonable
rate,
a
rate
that
is
not
confiscatory.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
it
would,
it
has
refused
to
constitutionalize
the
embedded
cost
or
historical
cost
formulation.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
t-,
that
argument
is
made,
but
it's
not
substantiated
by
anything
in
the
record
in
in
this
this
long,
elaborate
telric
articulation
of
of
numerous
standards,
both
with
respect
to
cost
of
capital
and
depreciation
because
the
very
next...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that
because
that's
precisely
what
it
said
in
the
statute.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i-
u-
you
may
not,
justice
scalia,
but
the
but
the
the
case
has
been
presented
on
alternative
bases
the
heavy
burden
that
the
local
exchange
carriers
must
carry
here
is
proving
that
the
embedded
cost,
historic
cost
requirement
is
either
in
the
statute
or
in
the
constitution.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
its,
it
that's
correct.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i'm,
the
problem,
justice...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
it
is
not
taken
into
account
what
their
embedded
costs
are
with
respect
to
portions
of
their
network
that
may
or
may
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
provision
of
the
service
or
the
network
element
involved
here.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
can't
determine
what
those
are.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
justice
scalia.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
spinning
a
wheel
is
okay.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
precisely.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that's
one
of
the
things
that
i
was,
that
mr.
barr
said
that
i
think
the
court
would
take
issue
with.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
the
the
baseline
constitutional
standard,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
once
you
can
look
at
the
results,
is
this
a
non
f-
confiscatory
result.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
court,
the
t-
congress
might
have
said,
with
respect
to
a
transportation
company,
you've
had
it
au-
that
t-
you've
had
the
taxi
service
all
to
yourself
for
all
these
many
years
and
now
we're
going
to
allow
other
some
competition
in
there,
and
you
and
you've
got
some
monopolistic
facility,
and
we're
going
to
let
s-
your
competitors
use
some
piece
of
it.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
what
they
wanted
to
do
with
the
st-,
the
they
wanted
to
accomplish
a
number
of
goals,
which
are
set
forth
in
the
preface
of
the
statute
to
which
i
alluded
to
before,
which
is
to
reduce
prices,
to
inspire...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
one
of
the
important
considerations,
and
it's
hard
to
not...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
the
important
objectives
that
they
hoped
to
achieve
was
to
develop
a
pricing
methodology
that
would
encourage
new
entrants
to
come
into
the
market
and
pay
fees
that
would
allow
them
to
enter
the
market
at
competitive
rates
and,
encourage
them
to
develop
new...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yeah,
i
s-,
i
think
that's
a
fair
premise.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
seems
to
me
that
they
did
try
to...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
pointed
out
in
your
e-
in
your
dissent,
your...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
in
the
other
other
time
this
case
was
before
the
court,
there
are
a
variety
of
different...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that
various
different
economists
look
at
and
think
that
they
can
accomplish
those
kind
of
objectives.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
in
the
first
place,
we're
not
talking
about
replicating
an
entire
firm.
