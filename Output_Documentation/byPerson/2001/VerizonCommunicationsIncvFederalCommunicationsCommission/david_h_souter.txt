by

it

some

you're

you

then
why
haven't
you
come

the

there

i-

justice

but
you're
saying
the

and
the

these
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
in
the
telecommunications
act
of
1996,
congress
sought
to
promote
competition
in
local
telephone
markets
in
part
by
requiring
incumbent
companies
with
local
monopolies
to
list
elements
of
their
telephone
networks
to
competitors.
to
implement
the
act,
the
fcc
promulgated
the
regulations
at
issue
which
prescribed
pricing
of
elements
for
lease
and
additionally
requires
incumbents
to
combine
or
connect
the
elements
as
necessary
for
the
entrants
to
provide
retail
services.
the
eighth
circuit
invalidated
both
the
fcc’s
pricing
rule
and
its
additional
combination
rule
as
inconsistent
with
the
plain
meaning
of
the
act.
the
fcc’s
pricing
rule
prescribes
a
forward-looking
rate
setting
method
on
the
basis
of
what
it
calls
total
element
long-run
cost
or
telric
for
short,
and
that
refers
to
the
most
efficient
technology
and
network
configuration
available
at
existing
wire
centers.
the
circuit
of
court
read
section
252(d)(1)
of
the
act
which
governs
pricing
to
allow
forward-looking
methods
of
rate
setting
as
a
general
matter
but
not
telric.
because
even
though
telric
did
not
resolve
the
confiscation
of
the
incumbent’s
property,
it
did
not
take
into
account
the
incumbent’s
actual
cost
of
leasing
out
an
element.
the
eighth
circuit
also
invalidated
the
additional
combination
rules
as
plainly
inconsistent
with
section
251(c)(3)
of
the
act,
which
sets
forth
the
general
duty
of
incumbents
to
lease
network
elements.
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
affirm
in
part,
reverse
in
larger
part,
and
remand.
we
affirm
the
eighth
circuit’s
holdings
that
the
act
permits
forward-looking
rate
setting
methods
and
that
telric
does
not
effect
an
unconstitutional
taking
of
property,
absent
of
showing
of
actual
confiscatory
rates.
we
reverse,
however,
the
circuit’s
invalidation
of
telric
and
the
additional
combination
rules.
neither
is
foreclosed
by
the
statutes
plain
meaning
and
each
deserves
deference
as
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
the
act
requires.
the
word
cost
in
plain
language
or
in
the
technical
vocabulary
of
public
utility
regulation
is
not
limited
to
the
actual
historical
cost
incurred
via
providing
incumbent.
for
example,
a
merchant
who
is
asked
the
cost
of
providing
the
goods
he
sells
may
reasonably
quote
the
current
wholesale
market
price
not
the
price
he
paid
for
the
particular
items
he
happens
to
have
on
his
shelves.
in
concepts,
such
as
reproduction
cost
and
traditional
rate
making
were
similarly
independent
of
actual
cost.
hence,
the
legitimacy
of
the
fcc’s
choice
of
a
forward-looking
not
a
rigidly
historical
pricing
methodology,
nor
was
it
unreasonable
for
the
fcc
to
pick
telric
as
the
means
to
implement
the
act’s
goal
of
promoting
local
competition.
as
a
threshold
matter,
telric
does
not
make
the
assumption
of
a
perfectly
competitive
market
as
the
incumbent’s
claim
while
it
does
make
explicit
allowance
for
adjustments
of
rates
by
state
commissions
in
individual
cases.
although
the
incumbents
have
argued
that
telric
will
discourage
not
promote
investment
in
facilities
by
competitors
entering
the
local
markets.
facts
on
the
record
are
at
odds
with
this
claim.
the
entrants
of
indicated
in
the
incumbents
do
not
dispute
that
the
telric
regime
has
facilitated
$55
billion
in
competitive
capital
spending
in
local
telephone
markets.
as
for
the
additional
combination
rules,
and
the
section
251(c)(3)
of
the
act
does
not
say
that
entrants
must
do
any
and
all
combining
but
rather
that
the
incumbent
shall
provide
unbundled
network
elements
in
a
manner
that
allows
requesting
carriers
to
combine
such
elements
in
order
to
provide
a
telecommunication
service.
the
rules
placing
a
limited
obligation,
nonetheless,
on
the
incumbents
to
do
some
combining,
a
reasonable
attempt
to
make
the
incumbents
statutory
duty
to
lease
elements
a
practical
one
by
giving
entrants
who
are
unable
to
make
a
connection
of
equipment
that
they
need
to
do
business,
the
option
of
paying
incumbents
to

the

for
them
where
that
is
technically
feasible.
