justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
has
been
said
that
most
legal
controversies
turn
on
two
questions:
who
decides,
and
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
this
case
presents
the
question
of
who
decides,
judge
or
jury?
the
context
is
capital
murder,
the
issue,
life
or
death.
an
arizona
jury
found
timothy
ring
guilty
of
first
degree
murder.
then
the
trial
judge
seating
without
a
jury
conducted
a
sentencing
hearing.
under
arizona
law,
to
impose
death
rather
than
life-imprisoned
the
sentencing
judge
must
find
at
least
one
of
several
statutorily
enumerated
aggravating
circumstance,
for
example,
that
the
murder
was
committed
in
an
unusually
cruel
manner
or
for
financial
gain.
in
ring’s
case,
a
murder
committed
in
the
course
of
robbery,
the
judge
found
the
latter
aggravating
factor
and
also
no
overweighing
cause
for
leniency
and
so
sentenced
ring
to
death.
ring
maintains
that
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
constitution
precludes
assignment
of
the
aggravating
factor
determination
to
a
judge.
any
finding
necessary
to
increase
a
sentence
above
the
maximum,
otherwise,
applicable
here
to
raise
the
sentence
from
life
to
death,
ring
contends
falls
within
the
decisional
providence
of
the
jury.
we
rejected
that
very
argument
in
a
1990
decision
walton
against
arizona.
in
walton,
we
held
that
arizona
property
assign
the
aggravating
factor
determination
to
the
judge.
aggravating
factors,
we
said,
were
sentencing
considerations
not
elements
of
the
offensive
capital
murder
therefore,
they
prompted
no
jury
trial
right.
two
years
ago,
ten
years
after
walton,
we
decided
a
pack
mocking
case
of
apprendi
v.
new
jersey.
apprendi
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
prohibits
exposing
a
defendant
to
a
prison
term
longer
than
the
maximum
sentence
he
could
receive
based
solely
on
the
facts
resolved
by
the
jury’s
verdict.
the
apprendi
majority
did
not
overrule
walton,
instead
the
court
distinguished
walton
from
apprendi
on
the
ground
that
under
arizona’s
capital
sentencing
scheme,
juries
did
bear
responsibility
for
finding
all
facts
necessary
to
put
a
crime
in
the
capital
category.
the
dissenters
in
apprendi
thought
the
majority
had
missperceived
arizona
law.
a
defendant
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
in
arizona,
the
apprendi
dissenters
observed,
cannot
receive
a
death
sentence
unless
a
judge
makes
the
factual
determination
that
a
statutory
aggravating
factor
exists.
this
reality,
that
apprendi
dissenters
said,
made
it
impossible
to
reconcile
the
two
decisions.
the
dissenters
in
apprendi
of
course
thought
walton
was
the
precedent
to
preserve
and
apprendi
misguided.
when
timothy
ring
appealed
his
death
sentence
to
the
arizona
supreme
court,
that
court
agreed
with
him
that
apprendi
cast
out
on
walton’s
continued
viability.
politely,
that
court
explained
that
the
aprendi
majority’s
attempt
to
distinguish
walton
was
unsatisfying.
a
defendant
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
in
arizona
that
state
highest
court
said
cannot
receive
a
death
sentence
unless
a
judge
makes
the
factual
determination
that
the
statutory
aggravating
factor
exists.
without
that
critical
finding,
the
maximum
sentence
to
which
the
defendant
exposed
its
life
imprisonment
and
not
the
death
penalty.
the
arizona
supreme
court
understood
however,
that
it
was
bound
to
follow
walton
unless
and
until
this
court
overruled
it,
accordingly,
that
court
rejected
ring’s
sixth
amendment
argument
and
affirmed
his
death
sentence.
informed
by
the
arizona
supreme
court’s
account
of
arizona
law,
we
now
comprehend,
as
the
apprendi
dissenters
did
two
years
ago,
that
apprendi
and
walton
are
indeed
irreconcilable
and
we
today,
overrule
walton.
we
hold
that
the
sixth
amendment
secures
the
capital
defendant
no
less
than
to
non-capital
defendant
the
right
to
a
jury
determination
of
any
fact
on
which
the
legislature
conditions
an
increase
in
their
maximum
punishment.
resisting
the
conclusion,
we
announce
today
the
state
of
arizona
essentially
restated
the
apprendi
majority’s
portrayal
of
alabama
law.
ring
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
for
which
arizona
law
specifies
death
or
life
imprisonment
as
the
only
sentencing
options.
ring
was
therefore
sentenced
within
the
range
of
punishment
authorized
by
the
jury’s
guilty
verdict.
this
argument
fails
in
view
of
the
provision
cross-referenced
in
arizona’s
first
degree
murder
statute.
the
cross-reference
provision
specifies
that
the
finding
of
an
aggravating
circumstance
is
essential
to
any
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
arizona
also
repeated
distinction
drawn
in
walton
between
elements
of
a
defense
which
must
be
found
by
a
jury
and
sentencing
factors
which
may
be
left
to
the
judge.
regarding
any
wrencheting
up
of
the
maximum
punishment
however,
apprendi
renders
arizona’s
argument
untenable;
apprendi
repeatedly
instructed
that
labeling
a
fact
where
circumstances
an
element
or
a
sentencing
factor
is
not
determinants
of
the
question,
who
decides
judge
or
jury?
finally,
arizona
put
a
twist
on
the
adage
death
is
different.
arizona
enumerated
aggravating
factors
the
state
suggested
under
pressure
of
this
court’s
eighth
amendment
decisions,
pressure
placed
on
the
states
to
limit
discretion
in
death
penalty
decision
making.
the
tightening
forced
on
the
states
by
the
eighth
amendment,
the
thought
seems
to
be,
should
be
matched
or
compensated
for
by
loosening
the
constraints
of
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee.
the
notion
that
expansion
of
one
right
justifies
contraction
of
another
is,
as
the
apprendi
dissenters
recognize,
far
into
our
constitutional
jurisprudence.
in
arriving
at
today’s
decision,
overruling
walton,
we
are
mindful
that
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
adhering
to
precedent
contributes
importantly
to
the
stability
of
the
law,
but
the
doctrine
is
not
unyielding
and
we
have
overruled
prior
decisions
when
there
is
strong
reason
for
setting
the
law
straight.
this
is
such
a
case.
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment
would
be
senselessly
diminished
if
it
encompassed
the
fact-finding
necessary
to
increase
a
defendant’s
maximum
prison
term
by
two
years,
but
not
the
fact-finding
necessary
to
put
him
to
death.
we
hold
that
the
sixth
amendment
controls
both
elevations
and
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
arizona
supreme
court.
justice
scalia
has
filed

concurring
opinion

which
justice
thomas
joins;

kennedy
