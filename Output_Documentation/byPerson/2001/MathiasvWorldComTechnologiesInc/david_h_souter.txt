justice
david
h.
souter
--your
injury
results
at
least
in
a
formal
sense
from
the
fact
that,
in
order
to
get
the
review
which
the
companies
sought,
they
made
your
state
regulators
defendants
in
a
case,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
essence
of
what
they
were...
the
essence
of
what
the
companies
were
claiming
was
not
some
kind
of
right
asserted
against
the
state
as
a
sovereign
entity
or
against
these
regulators
in
official
or
individual
capacity.
the
essence
of
what
was
going
on
was
an
attempt
to
review
in
effect
a
regulatory
decision.
why
does
that
implicate
immunity
in
the
sense
that
we
usually
think
of
immunity
in
eleventh
amendment
issues
to
be
implicated?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that's...
anyone
who
loses
a
case
has
been
injured
by
the
actions
of
the
judge
who
made
a
mistake
of
law,
or
by
the
regulator
in
a
regulatory
case,
so
that
in
itself
doesn't
take
it
out
of
the
usual
attempt
simply
to
get
review
of
a
judicial
or
a
quasi-judicial
decision
that
you
say
is
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
a
formality.
it
seems
to
me
that
by
naming
them
the...
those
who
are
appealing
are
doing
nothing
more
than
saying,
look,
these
people
in
their
adjudicatory
capacity
made
a
mistake,
we
want
that
mistake
reviewed,
in
the
same
sense
that
people
work
their
way
up
through
levels
of
appeal
in
the
judicial
system,
and
that
certainly
is
not
a
classic
example
of
the
kind
of
implication
of
state
sovereignty
which
the
immunity
doctrines
and
the
eleventh
amendment
have
addressed.
i
guess
i'm
saying,
is
this
really
a
case
that
implicates
eleventh
amendment
immunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
does
that,
again,
put
you
in
any
different
position
from
a
state
commission
in
a
run-of-the-mill
utilities
case,
even
within...
let's
say
just
within
the
state
system,
to
keep
it
simple?
in
some,
maybe
all
states,
if
there
is
an
appeal
from
a
rate
order
the
regulatory
body
can
be
represented
by
counsel
and
say,
you
know,
we
got
it
right,
don't
reverse
us,
but
they
are
not
regarded
as
parties
to
litigation
in
the
classic
sense.
so
you
could
have
been...
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is,
you
could
have
been
heard,
which
is
one
of
the
consequences
of
the
way
they
went
about
this
procedurally,
but
you
could
have
been
heard
without
being
a
party
in
the
usual
sense.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
they
had
decided
that
it
did?
i
think
that's
the
question.
what
if
they
had
decided,
having
construed
it,
well,
you
know,
this
is
really
what
it
says,
but
boy,
if
we
interpret
it
this
way,
it
violates
the
act?
then
what
do
they
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
can
you
construe
it
differently?
i
mean,
it
says
what
it
says.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
then
they're
not
doing
construction
any
more,
they're
doing
application
of
federal
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
they
came
to
that
conclusion,
that
although
they
construe
the
law
of
contracts
to
have
reading
a,
nonetheless
reading
a
violates
or
does
not
violate
the
federal
statute,
do
you
still
maintain
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction
to
review
that,
neither
under
the
provision
at
issue
in
this
case
nor
under
1331?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
can
review
it
because
there
is
a
federal
question
involved--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
for
purposes
of
1331
there's
no
federal
question
involved?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that
still
doesn't
explain...
i
mean,
you've
still
got
the
mess
that
justice
breyer
referred
to.
why
would
congress
want
to
legislate
that
kind
of
bifurcation
that
makes
for
all
of
this
confusion?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
congress
would
have
wanted
this
to
happen?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
--ms.
mcdowell,
i...
go
on,
tony,
finish.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the...
i
mean,
i
take
it
the
reason
you
assume
that
is
that
the
commission
is
not
a
party
in
interest
in
the
sense
of
having
a
personal
stake.
they
have
the
same
kind
of
stake,
i
suppose,
that
any
judge
does
when
an
order
of
his
gets
appealed,
but
that's
their
only
interest.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
was
going
to
enforce
it,
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
had
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
could
not
be
appealed
in
the
federal
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
aren't
we
slightly
outside
of
that
situation,
because
there
are
some
federal
standards
here,
aren't
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
can
be--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
public
interest
a
state
concept
or
a
federal
concept?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
has
to
be
state
on
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's
the
case,
then,
it
says
we've
got
an
unusual
action
here,
because
we're
talking
about
parties
who
have
no
personal
or
even
official
interest
except
as
interpreters
of
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
in
effect
saying
that
they
might
dispute
the
application
of
the
supremacy
clause.
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
the
state
court
is
not
named
as
a
party
when
a
case
gets
from
a
state
supreme
court
on
a
federal
question
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
assumed
that
they
will
respect
the
supremacy
clause
if
there
is
a
federal
declaration
of
law,
and
why
shouldn't
the
same
assumption
govern
if
there
is
federal
review
of
a
state
order
on,
in
effect,
a
federal
question
jurisdiction
basis?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
agree.
the
only
thing
that
i
have
been
suggesting
takes
this
out
of
that
simple
case
is
that
you
don't
have,
i
think,
here
the
classic
case
of
the
state
executive
official.
you
have
a
state
regulator
that
is
acting
in
a
kind
of
a
quasi-judicial
capacity,
and
it
seems
that
one
way
to
look
at
it
would
be
to
think
of
it
more
as
a
court
than
as
an
executive
office.
