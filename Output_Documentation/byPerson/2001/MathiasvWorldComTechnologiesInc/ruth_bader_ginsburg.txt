except,
isn't
it
the
ordinary
rule
that
when...
there
may
be
a
special
consideration
in
that
patent
context,
and
maybe
yours
is
also,
but
i
had
thought
that
reasons
that
went
against
the
judgment
winner
do
not
get
any
kind
of
preclusive
effect,
so
that
you
would
not
be
bound
by
this
jurisdictional
holding
which
was
against
you.
you
prevailed
on
the
merits,
you
have
that
judgment,
so
you
don't...
you're
not
stopped,
precluded
from
relitigating
the
case.
in
other
words,
the
two
go
together.
if
you
can't
appeal
it,
then
you're
not
bound
by
it.
isn't
that--
justice

and
did
you
say...
did
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
that
if
this
particular
issue
had
come
up
at
the
time
of
approval,
then
there
would
be
federal
court
review,
so
if
something...
the
character
of
the
issue
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
it's
just,
if
it
comes
up
in
one
proceeding,
federal
court,
if
it
doesn't
come
up
simultaneously,
the
very
same
question
doesn't
come
up
simultaneously,
then
you
have
this
split.

but
if
the
fcc
were
performing
this
role...
take
virginia's
statement...
and
you
are
appealing
the
fcc's
order,
all
those
cases
are
you
against
the
commission.
isn't
it...
isn't
that
routine?
