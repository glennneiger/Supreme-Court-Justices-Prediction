does
the
opinion
below
cause
you
some
kind
of
continuing
injury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
that
in
a
post
determination
interpretation
case,
that
the
commission
doesn't
look
to
251
and
252,
it
can't
look
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
it's
just
a
very
odd
concept
that
the
state
commission
launches
this
vehicle
having
looked
at
the
federal
law,
and
then
subsequent
interpretation
doesn't
involve
federal
law.
it's
just...
that's
just
hard
for
me
to
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
still
not
entirely
clear
on
what
your
position
is
if
the...
if
there's
an
interpretation
dispute
that
doesn't
raise
any
federal
question
at
all.
do
you
agree
that
that
has
to
be
resolved
only
in
a
state
court,
or
do
you
think
they
have
a
choice
of
forum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
question
is,
do
they
have
to
pay
on
tuesday
instead
of
thursday,
and
that's
governed
by
some
state
common
law
rule
or
something.
that,
you
would
agree,
could
not
be
litigated
in
federal
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
and
could
not
go
to
federal
court.
that's
the
other
part
of
my
question.
i
didn't
quite
get
your
answer
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
even
if
there's
a
waiver,
i
mean,
what
is...
you
have
to
have
federal
jurisdiction
before
you
can
sue
in
federal
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assume
there's
no
diversity,
just
a
normal
state
law.
i'm
still
not
quite
clear
whether
you
say
yes
or
no.
do
you
agree
with
the
carrier
that
it
is
a
pervasive...
like
a
tariff,
so
that
anything
relating
to
it
raises
a
federal
question,
or
do
you
agree
that
they
are
a
category
of
contract
issues
that
could
only
be
regulated
at
state,
or
litigated
in
state
court?
