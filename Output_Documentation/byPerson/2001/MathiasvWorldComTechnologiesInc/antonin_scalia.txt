justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
it's
no
longer
an
interpretation
question?
they
are
no
longer
interpreting
the
contract.
they
have
interpreted
it,
but
they
say,
having
interpreted
it
this
way,
we
find
that
this
way
violates
federal
law,
and
therefore
we
disallow
it,
and
there's
still
no
review
of
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
1331?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
relying
on
silence
regarding
interpretation,
and
in
the
hypothesis
we
were
just
discussing,
it
was
no
longer
an
interpretive
question.
the
state
court,
or
the
state
commission
had
decided
the
interpretation.
having
decided
it,
they
moved
to
another
question,
does
this
interpretation
violate
the
federal
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
they
have
to
move
to
that
second
question,
and
if
they
do,
they
just
override
their
interpretation,
but
that's
no
longer
an
interpretive
question,
it
seems
to
me,
at
that
point,
so
your
distinguishing
of
section
252
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
in
an
ordinary
private
contract,
if
the
state
court
refuses
to
enforce
the
contract,
let's
say
on
the
ground
that
it
would
be
a
contract
combination
or
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
and
thus
violate
the
sherman
act,
you
would
be
able
to
get
review
of
that
determination
in
federal
court,
wouldn't
you?
but
you're
saying
that
this
contract
can
be
overridden
and
disallowed
by
a
state
court
on
a
federal
ground
with
no
review
of
that
federal
ground
by
any
federal
court,
so
that
you
can
have
different
interpretations
of
the
sherman
act
all
around
the
country,
with
no
federal
court
being
able
to
review
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--let's
assume
we
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know
in
order
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
going
to
ask
the
same
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
still
going
to
have
some
bifurcation?
you're
still
going
to
have
some
contract
cases
that
go
to
the
state
court,
and
some
that
go
to
the
federal
court?
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
under
1331?
would
you
say
everything
gets
into
court
under
1331,
whether
it
deals
with
deciding
whether
the
agreement
meets
the
requirements
of
this
section
or
not?
you
would
say
the
contract
is
a
federal
contract,
so
that
under
1331
even
the
interpretation
of
that
contract
gets
into
federal
court,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
gee,
you
ought
to,
because
that's
the
only
thing
that
will
stop
this
terrible
bifurcation
that
you're
so
worried
about.
it's
still
going
to
be
a
mess.
you're
going
to
have
some
cases
in
federal
court
and
some
in
state
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
get
into
that,
you're
separating
interpretation
of
the
contract
from
violation
of
the
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
mean
the
state
still
has
control
over
what
the
contract
means?
it's
still
a
state
contract,
and
the
ultimate
determiner
of
what
the
contract
means
ought
to
be
the
state,
if
it's
state
law,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
different
states
have
different
approaches.
they
may
even
have
different
rules
of
evidence
and
so
forth.
what's
going...
i
don't
see
how
the
federal
government
gets
into
this
business
without
taking
on
itself
the
burden
of
interpreting
these
contracts.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
interpretation
is
barred?
i
mean,
if
a
contract
says
something,
it
very
plainly
on
its
face
says
something
that
violates
the
federal
act,
there's
only
one
way
to
interpret
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
don't
understand
how
you
play
that
game.
i
mean,
you're
assuming
that
it's
always
ambiguous
whether
you
can
interpret
in
a...
so
that
you
can
interpret
it
in
a
way
that
violates
federal
law
or
in
a
way
that
doesn't,
and
that
somehow
therefore
that
interpretation
becomes
a
federal
question.
even
if
that's
correct,
it's
certainly
not
always
true
that
there
is
the
possibility
of
interpreting
it
in
a
way
that
does
not
violate
federal
law,
and
i
guess
you're
saying
that
nonetheless,
in
that
case,
the
case
becomes
a
federal
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
the
claim
would
be,
look,
the
very
contract
that
you're
interpreting
is
a
contract
which
is
authorized,
and
authorized
only
by
federal
law,
and
that's
enough
to
get
us
into
federal
court,
and
you
reject
that
position.
