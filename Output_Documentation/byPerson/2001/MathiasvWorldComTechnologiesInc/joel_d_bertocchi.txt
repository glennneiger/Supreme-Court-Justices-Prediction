mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
yes,
you
are,
mr.
chief
justice.
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
local
telecommunication
provisions
of
the
telecommunications
act
of
1996
introduced
competition
into
local
telephone
markets.
the
act
did
so
in
sections
251
and
252.
section
251
imposes
the
obligation
to
interconnect,
and
requires
incumbent
carriers
to
enter
into
agreements
that
will
provide
access
to
their
competitors
to
those
incumbents'
networks.
section
252
prescribes
procedures
under
which
those
agreements,
contracts,
as
they
are,
are
negotiated,
arbitrated,
approved,
and
filed,
and
the
act
stops
there.
it
does
not
go
on
to
interpret...
to
discuss
interpretation
or
enforcement
of
those
agreements.
from
its
title
through
its
text,
section
252
demonstrates
that
congress
was
silent
regarding
interpretation
and
enforcement.
nonetheless,
interpretation
is
not
unaccounted
for,
because
into
that
silence,
under
preexisting
law,
stepped
the
states.
that
preexisting
law,
still
good
under
the
1996
act,
not
preempted
or
repealed
by
it,
provides
that
the
interpretation
of
these
contracts
is
a
state
law
process
which
has
been
deliberately
left
by
congress
to
state
regulators,
including
state
judges,
who
will
apply
state
contract
law
to
those
provisions.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
we--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--yes.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
i
believe
the
conclusive
answer
is
that
our
assertion
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
over
us
and
that
we...
if
there
was
jurisdiction
over
us
and
over
this
cause
of
action,
we
are
asserting
immunity
as
a
claim
that
we
can
bring
regardless
of
the
result
on
the
merits.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
i
cannot...
i'm
afraid
i
cannot
cite
you
to
any.
i
believe
that
these
questions
are
preserved
regardless
of
the
merits.
i
cannot
point
you
to--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--well,
it
does,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
it
is
going
to,
if
it
stands,
result
in
our
continuing
to
be
brought
to
federal
court,
in
spite
of
the
immunity
that
we
assert,
and
it
is
going
to
continue
to
place
these
cases
in
federal
court
even
though
we
believe
that
they
are
properly
state
court
cases
completely,
and
that
our
state
court
should
have
the
opportunity
to
review
these,
to
review
all
the
matters
that
are
raised,
and
to
fulfill
both
their
duty
to
apply
state
law
and
their
obligation
to
consider
whether
their
state
law
construction
in
any
way
is
inconsistent
with
federal
law.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor,
and
i
will
have
a
look.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
i
understand,
your
honor.
i
believe,
though,
that
we...
that
the
district
courts
of
the
seventh
circuit
would
consider
themselves
bound
by
the
seventh
circuit's
decision,
and
we
would
have
to
go
to
court
to
litigate
that,
which
we
believe
would
be
a
violation
of
our
immunity,
and
in
addition,
we
believe
that
the
jurisdiction
would
not
be
there,
and
by
doing
that
we
would
essentially
be
being
kept
out,
as
we
have
been
kept
out
of
our
state
courts
for
at
least
some
period
of
time,
and
in
that
sense
i
believe
that
there
is
a
continuing
injury
that
results
from
this.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
they
subjected
them
to...
the
individual
commissioners
to
suit
and
made
them
defend
their
rule,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
i
think
it
does
so
for
two
reasons.
first,
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
complaint
that
ameritech
filed,
ameritech
asserted
in
its
complaint
that
it
had
been
injured
by
the
actions
of
the
state
commissioners.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
result...
the
other
thing
that
the
complaint
does
is,
it
names
the
individual
commissioners
as
defendants.
it
subjects
them
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court,
and
it
raises
issues
as
to
whether...
which
we
have
argued
at
great
length
in
all
of
our
briefs,
as
to
whether
that
violates
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
we
believe
it
does.
i
will
admit
that
as
things
have
turned
out,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
district
court
and
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
disagree
with
the
decision
of
the
commission,
there
have...
none
of
the
parade
of
possible
bad
things
have
happened
to
us.
there
has
been
no
injunction
entered
against
us.
there
has
been
no
contempt
proceeding.
at
this
point
there
might
not
be
an
award
of
attorney's
fees,
but
that's
because
of
the
way
the
case
came
out.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
not
in
this
interpretation
case,
no.
we
believe
we
were
necessary
parties,
but
we
believe
that
because
we
believe
these
are
state
actions
and
that
we
are...
and
we
are
necessary
parties
under
state
law
to
administrative
review.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
given
the
fact
that
this
was
a
federal
court
reviewing
a
state
proceeding,
we
might
well
have
been
able
to
be
heard
if
the
district
judge
had
allowed
us
in,
and
again,
as
i
indicated...
and
i
believe
this
is
still
in
response
to
the
question...
it
has
turned
out
that
because
the
district
court
agreed
with
us,
nothing
has
happened
to
us
that
doesn't
happen
to
us
in
state
court
when
our
decisions
are
affirmed.
but
in
state
appellate
proceedings
from
illinois
commerce
commission
orders,
when
the
appellate
court
disagrees,
it
enters
a
decree
that
invalidates
or
in
some
way
amends
or
remands
the
order.
that
is
not
the
type
of
relief
that
is
contemplated
in
the
full
range
of
a
federal
equity
suit
in
which
commissioners
are
named
as
individuals
or
even,
i
would
submit,
in
a
case
in
which
the
state
commission
were
named
as
a
party.
in
this
case,
ameritech
did
not
sue
the
state
commission,
for
reasons
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand,
but
we're
willing
to,
because
we're
here,
assume
that
the
commissions
are...
commissioners
are
an
acceptable
substitute,
but
even
in
that
instance,
the
order
is
entered
by
the
tribunal,
by
the
appellate
tribunal
on
the
state
side
against...
an
order
is
entered
that
simply
supervenes
the
commission's
order.
in
this
instance,
ameritech
filed
a
complaint
asking
for
the
federal
court
to
enter
orders
that
are
specifically
directed
at
the
commissioners
and,
if
they
had
sued
the
commission,
would
have
been
specifically
directed
at
the
commission.
that
is
relief
that
we
don't
believe
is
contemplated
by
the
statute,
but
we
also
think
it's
significantly...
it
could
be
significantly
different.
it
hasn't
turned
out
that
way...
excuse
me.
it
hasn't
turned
out
that
way
in
this
case,
because
the
district
court
and
the
seventh
circuit
have
agreed
on
the
merits,
but
it
could
have,
and
that
was
our
concern,
and
that
is
why
we
are
here,
because
we
don't
know
how
it's
going
to
turn
out
in
the
next
case.
your
honors,
these
proceedings,
interpretive
of
the
contracts
as
they
were,
did
not
take
place
under
section
252.
that
qualifier
is
critical
to
jurisdiction
under
section
(e)(6)
and,
indeed,
limits
any
application
of
(e)(6).
it
does
not
make
any
difference...
respondents
have
devoted
a
substantial
amount
of
energy
to
this,
but
really
it
does
not
make
any
difference
if
we
are
talking
about
an
action,
a
case,
a
determination,
whatever
it
is
that
the
commission
does
still
must
be
done
under
252
in
order
for
jurisdiction
to
attach
under
252(e)(6),
and
in
that
respect
the
text
and
scope
of
section
252
is
plain.
it
goes
as
far
as
the
filing,
the
formation
and
filing
of
the
agreement--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--your
honor,
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
blue
brief
in...
we've
attached
both
sections
251
and
252
as
an
appendix,
and
252
starts
at
page
12a
of
that
appendix.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
if
we're
talking
about
an
interpretation
case,
the
answer
is
essentially
a
combination
of
state
law,
which
now
makes
compliance
with
federal
law,
with
the
act,
a
requirement,
and
the
general
requirement
that
in
any
case
that
a
state
court
hears,
it
not
contravene
federal
law.
that
law--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not,
if
we
are
talking
about
an
interpretation.
to
read
that
language
into
252
is
to
suggest
that
an
interpretation
is
really
a
modification,
and
i
think
those
things
are
very
distinct
concepts
of
the
law.
if
it
happens
during
an
approval
process,
that's
different,
but
that
would
be
my
response.
i
think
in
the
end
the
result
would
be
the
same,
because
the
state
court
is
clearly
required
in
any
case,
and
certainly
in
one
of
these
cases,
to
determine
whether
it...
its
decision,
its
construction
of
the
contract
follows
federal
law.
that's
what
the
commission
did
in
this
case,
and
that's
what
the
illinois
appellate
court
would
do.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
it...
well,
your
honor,
interestingly
enough,
in
this
case
it
can't,
because
this
was...
the
provisions
that
deal
with
reciprocal
compensation
in
this
case
were
negotiated,
and
they're
not
required
to
comply
with
the
act,
but
even
in
a
case
where
there
had
been
an
arbitration,
and
where
there
was
an
issue
with
respect
to
that,
i
believe
that
certainly
the
commission...
certainly
the
court
could
look
to
federal
law
and
see
if
there
was
anything
that
didn't
comply
with
251
and
252.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
i
think
the
interpretation
will
involve
federal
law
in
many
instances,
your
honor,
but
the
interpretation
cases
are
going
to
be
driven
by
state
law,
and
this
case
is
another
good
example
of
that.
in
this
case,
the
way
the
commission,
i
think,
looked
at
this
case
is
the
proper
way.
they
construed
the
contract
first
and
then
determined
whether
their
construction
violated
any
federal
law,
including
fcc
rulings,
and
decided
that
it
did
not,
so
i
am
not
at
all
suggesting--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--then
i
think
that
they
would
have
to
construe
it
differently.
they
would
have
to--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--well,
they
cannot...
they
are--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--i
think,
your
honor,
in
that
instance,
if
they
wanted...
if
the
contract
could
survive,
what
they
would
do
is,
they
would
say
the
federal
law
superseded
whatever
state
contract
principle
they
applied
in
construing
it
in
the
first
place.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
exactly,
your
honor.
there
is
not
a
law--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--we
do
maintain
that,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
yes--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--well,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
section
1331,
we
start
our
analysis
back
at
section
252.
we
believe
that...
and
i
think
that
the
case
that
comes
closest
to
describing
the
way
this
would
work
is
the
jackson
transit
case.
jackson
transit...
in
jackson
transit,
the
court
seemed
to
assume
1331
jurisdiction
but
went
on
to
say,
we
have
to
take
a
look
at
congressional
intent
to
determine
whether
those
contracts
which
are
required
to
be
in
place
by
federal
law,
whether
litigation
over
whether
those
contracts
are
binding
and
what
they
mean
should
take
place
in
federal
or
state
court,
and
we
believe,
again,
that
the
silence
regarding
interpretation
in
section
252
and
the
remedy
provided
in
section
252(e)(6)
suggests
that
that
is
the
remedy
that
congress
intended
to
be
made
available.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--your
honor,
i...
it
is
no
longer
an
interpretive
question,
but
the
proceeding
is
still
an
interpretive
proceeding.
we
read
252
to
cover
a
certain
type
of
proceeding
that
leads
to
approval
and
ends
at
a
very
particular
point.
respondents
point
out
that
this
is
not
the
end
point
for
disputes
under
the
contract,
and
that
is
certainly
likely
to
be
true,
but
it
is
the
end
point
for
how
far
252
goes,
and
the
fact
that
federal
issues
may
come
up
afterwards
does
not
change
the
fact
that
congress
in
252(e)(6)
provided
a
very
specific
remedy
that
was
designed
to
review
matters
that
were
decided
in
the
approval
process.
we
believe
that
that
jurisdictional
restriction
operates
both
with
respect
to
252(e)(6)
and
suggests
that
it
applies
under...
that
a
limitation
should
be
placed
on
1331
jurisdiction
as
well.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
it
is
more
difficult,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
that's
what
it
does.
we're
talking
about--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
to
read
it
that
way
and
then...
and
to
include
interpretation,
enforcement
proceedings
under
it
would
essentially
read
the
words
under
252
under
the
statute.
certainly
there
is
a
difference
between
the
language,
the
word
determination
and
the
language
in
the
actual
preemption
provision
in
(e)(4)
that
says,
approvals
or
rejections,
but...
and
the
respondents
argue
that
that
suggests
that
determinations
is
a
broader
term.
our
position
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
a
broader
term,
but
our...
that
if
it's
not
under
252,
it
doesn't
matter
what
kind
of
action
it
is,
and
interpretations
and
enforcements
are
not
covered
by
that
statute.
it's
a
very
particular
statute
that
goes
only
so
far
and
no
further.
in
addition,
it
seems
that
that
argument
and
the
use
of
those
words
is
somewhat
inconsistent,
because
the
united
states
suggests
that
the
more
specific
terms
in
(e)(4)
suggest
that
determinations
must
mean
anything
that
happens
in
a
case
related
to
these
contracts,
but
it
seems
to
me
if
approvals
and
agreements
in
(e)(4)
is
a
narrow
term,
then
approvals
and
agreements,
which
is
all
252
addresses,
is...
must
be
read
equally
as
a
narrow
term,
and
it's
inconsistent
to
say
that
determinations
under
252
goes
beyond
that.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
yes.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
exactly,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
that
procedural
difference
is
the
basis
for
the
distinction,
but
we
believe
that
that
distinction
is
entirely
rational
is
in
accord
with
what
happens
in
the
life
of
contracts.
in
real
life,
in
contracts
outside
the
context
of
telecommunications,
issues
will
come
up
in
negotiation
and
maybe
there'll
be
a
contract
and
maybe
there
won't.
if
the
same
issue
comes
up
once
the
contract
is
in
force
and
the
parties
can't
reach
an
agreement,
which
they
have
the
opportunity
to
do
in
any
case,
then
they
have
to
go
to
court,
someone
has
to
go
to
court
to
get
it
enforced,
so
the
notion
that
the
timing
of
an
issue
affects
where
it's
going
to
be
litigated
is
not
at
all
surprising,
and
is
entirely
consistent
with
what
we
believe
congress'
intent
was
in
252.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
my
belief
is
that
if
a
state
court
invalidated
a
contract
on
federal
grounds,
appeal
would
be
to
the
state
appellate
court,
and
the
federal
court
that
would
be
able
to
review
that
determination
if
it
was
wrong
is
this
court,
so
there
is
always
going
to
be
a
federal
court
that
can
determine
that.
what...
and
the--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--if
that
were--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--for
purposes
of
1331,
there
may
be
federal
issues
involved,
but
we
believe
that
there
is
a
specific
congressional
intent,
reflected
in
the
specificity
of
252...
you
can
look
at
it
as
silence,
or
you
can
look
at
it
as
specificity...
in
the
specificity
of
252
to
have
these
matters
litigated
in
state
court,
and
again
i
would
cite
jackson
transit
for
the
proposition
that
whether
there
is
an
arising
under
question
under
1331
does
not
mean
you
still
don't
look
to
the
question
of
where
the
contracts
are
litigated.
in
that
case,
the
contracts
had
to
be
there
because
of
federal
law.
they
had
to
be
honored
because
of
federal
law,
but
there
was
a
legislative
intent
that
was
discerned
by
this
court
to
have
those...
the
binding...
to
have
the
litigation
concerning
those
contracts
take
place
in
state
court.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
i
think
they
would
want
such
a
thing
because
the
telecommunications
act
represents
a
change
in
the
way
utilities
are
regulated,
and
although
everybody
agrees
that
that
is
true,
i
think
that
the
respondents
misapprehend
the
change.
the
change
is
to
reduce
regulation
over
the
parties
to
telecommunications
transactions
once
access
is
assured.
the
interest
in
this
case
was
access,
and
once
that's
over
with,
these
are
to
be...
these
cases
are
to
be
treated,
i
believe,
like
regular
contracts
cases.
this
case,
again,
is
a
good
example.
it
was
driven
by
state
law
and
the
federal
questions
came
up
afterwards
in
determining
whether
the
construction
was
proper,
and
in
that
instance
i
think
congress
intended
to
leave
the
matters
to
state...
to
the
state
commission
under
state
law
and
to
state
courts.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
i
think
congress
would
want
to
do
it
because
it
recognized
that
most
of
these
cases
were
going
to
be
like
this
one.
this
is
not
a
case
about
access,
which
is--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
well,
your
honor,
i
think...
this,
in
the
sense
of
state
courts
deciding,
construing
these
contracts
and
then
deciding
any
incidental
federal
law
questions
under
their
normal
obligation
to
do
so.
yes,
we
think
that's
what
they
wanted,
and
we
think
that's
what
they
wanted
because
they
would
recognize,
as
in
this
case,
that
these
cases
are
state-law
driven.
the
goal
of
the
act
is
access.
this
case
is
not
about
access.
the
respondent,
the
competing
telecom
companies
had
had
access,
they
will
have
access,
they
have
it
today,
and
they
will
have
it
tomorrow.
this
case
is
about
whether
ameritech
owes
them
money.
that
is
a
contracts
case.
it
may
implicate
federal
law,
as
any
state
contracts
case
theoretically
could,
but
we
believe
that
congress
wanted
them
to
be
treated
as
contracts
cases.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
response
to
questions
from
justice
souter,
adjudicative
context
really
provides
the
reasoning
that
ex
parte
young
doesn't
apply
here.
contrary
to
what
mr.
smith
said,
the
statute
doesn't
say
you
can
sue
state
commissioners
in
federal
court.
(e)(6)
doesn't
reference
state
commissioners
at
all.
this
case
is
in
a
sense
more
like
larson
than
larson.
larson
was
not
about
whether
the
case...
whether
the
authority
for
the
contracting
official
came
from
federal
or
the
state
law.
it
was
about
the
characterization
of
what
he
was
doing,
and
the
court
assumed
he
was
wrong
in
what
he
did
in
that
instance,
and
in
this
instance,
in
the
adjudicative
context,
it
makes
even
more
sense.
certainly
with
respect
to,
i
believe,
mr.
smith's
remark
about
a...
mr.
smith
referred
to
the
fact,
or
there
was
a
question
about
the
fact
that
the
commission
might
dispute
the
application
of
the
supremacy
clause,
and
certainly,
if
a
commission
did
that,
if
a
commission
declined
to
follow
federal
law,
that
would
be
a
different
story,
and
undoubtedly
there
would
be
some
ability
to
correct
that
action.
but
the
illinois
commission
isn't
doing
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
illinois
commerce
commission
has
never
tried.
this
is,
i
think,
correctly
characterized
as
a
quasi-judicial
proceeding,
not
executive
or
legislative.
it
is
not
accurately
compared
to
rate-making
cases,
which
are
much
more
legislative.
this
is
adjudication
of
a
contract
issue
regarding
a
particular
contract,
and
in
that
respect
i
would
go
back...
that
would
lead
me
to
the
last
point
i
want
to
make,
which
is
that
this
is
a
case
about
a
contract
to
which
the
act
does
not
apply.
it's
interesting,
mr.
smith
said
he
didn't
think
the
complaint
in
this
case
would
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
yet
he's
here
arguing
that
it
belongs
in
federal
court.
i'm
assuming
that...
and
i
may
be
wrong.
i
don't
want
to
speak
for
him.
i'm
assuming
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
would
be
an
attempt
to
throw
it
out
of
federal
court.
these
cases,
this
case
is
a
contract
case
regarding
a
contract
to
which
the
act
does
not
apply,
and
section
252(a),
which
allows
the
courts
to
negotiate...
allows
the
parties
to
negotiate
contracts
any
way
they
want
clearly
suggests
that
they
have
the
right
to
do
so
without
regard
to
federal
law.
in
this
instance,
ameritech
has
put
federal
allegations
in
the
complaint.
one
of
them
is
that
this
contract
violates
the
act,
but
if
you
look
in
their
brief,
they'll
see...
you'll
see
that
they
say
that
this
can't
be
restricted
to
violations
of
federal
law
because
in
negotiated
cases
that
would
allow
jurisdiction
to
move
on
to
the...
to
move
to
what
they
call
the
vanishing
point.
we
agree
with
that
entirely.
jurisdiction
over
interpretation
does
go
to
the
vanishing
point.
the
only
way
federal
issues
are
going
to
come
up
in
these
cases
is
if
state
courts
construe
a
contract
in
a
certain
way
and
then
disregard
federal
law.
that
is
not
what
the
illinois
commerce
commission
is
going
to
do.
thank
you,
your
honor.
