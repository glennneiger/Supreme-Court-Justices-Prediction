justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
ms.--
--do
they
have
authority
under
state
law
to
do
that?
if
we
asked
the
solicitor
from
illinois...
i
didn't
have
time
to
ask
him...
what
is
the
authority
by
which
the
state
commission
proceeded
in
this
case,
what
would
he
have
said,
do
you
think,
and
would
you...
and
is
that
the
same
as
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
absent--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
you
say
it...
are
you
saying
that
necessarily
the
state
commission
must
be
acting
under
252?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
252--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
was
just
going
to
say,
252
refers
to
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
is
that
a
federal
standard,
or
does
that
just
incorporate
state
standards
from
state
to
state,
or
is
it
a
little
bit
of
both,
because
most
states
have
a
formulation
something
like
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ms.
mcdowell,
i
have
a
problem
with
other
language
in
this
(e)(6).
one
of
the
arguments
you
make
is
that
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
bifurcate
these
proceedings,
that
they
should
all
be
in
the
federal
court,
the
interpretation
as
well
as
the
approval.
the
problem
is,
the
only
thing
that
(e)(6)
allows
the
federal
district
court
to
determine
is
not
the
interpretation
of
the
contract.
it
does
not
give
the
federal
court
authority
to
determine
what
the
contract
says.
it
only
gives
it
authority,
i
quote,
to
determine
whether
the
agreement
or
statement
meets
the
requirements
of
section
25
and
this
section.
now,
in
some
cases,
there
may
be
a
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
whether
a
particular
interpretation
will
violate
the
federal
rules,
but
there
are
going
to
be
a
lot
of
other
contract
disputes
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
whether
there's
a
violation
of
the
federal
rules.
now,
are
all
of
those
contract
cases
going
to
go
to
state
court,
and
all
of
the
contract
cases
that
somehow
involve
the
question
of
whether
the
agreement
or
statement
meets
the
requirements
of
this
section,
do
they
go
to
federal
court,
or
do
you
just
ignore
those
words,
that
limitation?
to
determine
whether
the
agreement
or
statement
meets
the
requirements
of
section
25
and
this
section,
that's
the
only
authority
the
federal
court
has.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
all
of
the
instances
projected
by
justice
stevens,
do
you
think
the
state
would
be
a
necessary
party,
or
would
there
be
any
cases
in
which,
a
contract
dispute
where
the
state
isn't
a
necessary
party?
the
state
is
a
necessary
party
because
it
goes
first
through
the
commission?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
but
doesn't...
even
in
the
case
justice
stevens
describes
about
paying
tuesday
or
thursday,
isn't
the
presumption
that
there
would
have
been
a
state
commission
order
which
is
now
being
set
aside?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
they're
not
a
necessary
party,
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
it's
sustainable
to
say
that
there
has
been
a
waiver
because...
by
participation
in
the
state
scheme,
so
that
you
don't
need
ex
parte
young?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
if
you
have
a
case
in
which
one
of
the
arguments
made
by
one
of
the
parties
is
that
if
you
interpret
the
contract
this
way,
it
will
violate
the
federal
act?
does
that
stay
in
the
state
court,
or
is
that
a
federal
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
issue
we've
been
wrestling
with
for
100
years
exists
in
one
of
these
cases,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
don't
one
of
these
contracts
refer
to
federal
law?
