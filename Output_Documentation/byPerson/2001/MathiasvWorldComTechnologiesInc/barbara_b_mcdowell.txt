ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
district
courts
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
cases
contending
that
a
state
public
utility
commission
has
construed
and
enforced
an
interconnection
agreement
in
a
manner
contrary
to
federal
law.
that's
true
whether
one
looks
specifically
at
section
252(e)(6)
of
the
1996
act,
or
more
generally
at--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
your
honor,
the
section
establishes
specific
procedures
to
be
followed
at
the
arbitration
and
approval
stage.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
but
these
agreements
exist
only
by
virtue
of
section
252.
the
state
commissioners
have
authority
to
regulate
these
agreements
only
by
virtue
of
section
252.
they're
subject
to
the
standards
of
section
252,
and--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--no,
it
doesn't
speak
specifically
about
interpretation
and
enforcement.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
but
this
court
said
in
the
ardestani
case,
for
example,
that
under
a
statutory
provision
means
subject
to
or
by
authority
of,
and
state
commissions
are
acting
by
authority
of
section
252
when
they're
construing
and
enforcing
interconnection
agreements.
they
have
no
other
authority
under
federal
law
to
do
that.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
we
don't
have
to
guess,
because
the
state
commission
specifically
said
what
authority
it
was
proceeding
under,
and
it
cited
both
section
252
and
illinois
law,
and
certainly
a
state
commission,
whenever
it
takes
an
official
act,
is
acting
at
least
in
part
under
its
own
state
law--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--and
here
it's
acting
also
acting
under
section
252.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
when
it's
regulating
an
interconnection
agreement
that's
established
by
virtue
of
section
252,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
it's
a
federal
standard.
it's
a
standard
that's
been
incorporated
in
the
communications
laws
for
many
years.
the
states,
pursuant
to
section
252(e)(3),
are
allowed
to
also
impose
consistent
state
standards
in
the
course
of
their
approval,
and
interpretation
we
would
say
of
the
interconnection
agreements
as
well,
but
it's
basically
a
federal
standard.
it's
one
under
which
the
fcc
could
promulgate
regulations
to
instruct
the
state
commissions
and
to--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
and
the--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
you
may
have
bifurcation,
or
there
are
other
alternatives.
for
example,
at
the
interpretation
and
enforcement
stage
the
parties
would
be
free
to
go
to
state
court.
there's
not
an
exclusive
direction
of
the
parties
to
federal
court,
as
there
is
at
the
approval
stage
under
section
(e)(4),
and
in
some
of
these
cases
state
commissions
may
waive
their
sovereign
immunity
and
decide
that
they
would
rather
have
these
claims
heard
entirely
in
federal
court,
and
that
would
be
permissible
as
well
under
the
supplemental--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--we're
not
pressing
that
argument,
your
honor,
although
ameritech--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
there
may
be
some
such
cases,
but
as
i
was
suggesting,
there
are
alternatives
to
that.
in
addition,
there
may
not
be
that
many
cases
in
which
there's
a
viable
claim
that
a
state
commission
has
interpreted
an
agreement
contrary
to
federal
law.
these
cases
have
typically
come
up
only
with
respect
to
this
particular
issue
of
compensation
for
internet
calls,
a
very
important
issue
to
the
carriers,
and
one
that
they've
been
willing
to
litigate
extensively,
but
it's
not
clear
at
this
early
stage
in
the
implementation
of
the
1996
act
that
there
are
going
to
be
a
large
number
of
claims
of
this
sort,
so
the
thought
that
there
are
going
to
be...
there's
going
to
be
a
bifurcation
problem
in
every
case
is
not
clear,
at
least
at
this
stage.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
unless
there
was
some
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction,
they
would
have
to
go
to
state
court
for
that--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--we
haven't
yet
taken
a
definitive
position
on
this
question,
justice
stevens.
ameritech
is
arguing
that
these
contracts,
interconnection
agreements
are
pervasively
federal,
similar
to
a
federal
tariff,
so
that
every
question
that
arises
under
them
is
necessarily
federal.
we
think
for
purposes
of
this
case,
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
decided,
what's
relevant
are
only
those
claims
that
contend
that
a
state
commission
has
violated
the
1996
act
in
its
interpretation
of
an
agreement,
so
there
may
be
a
large
category
of
cases
that
can
come
to
state
court
and
that
would
present
only
issues
of
state
law.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
yes,
unless
there
was
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
by
the
state
commission
and
diversity
or
some
other
basis
for
jurisdiction.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
and
there
may
be
diversity.
diversity
was
asserted,
for
example,
in
the
north
carolina
case.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
see
it
as
a
difficult
question
on
which
we
haven't
taken
a
definitive
position.
the
question
ultimately
is
one
of
congress'
intent,
and
certainly
there
is
much
in
the
statute
to
suggest
that
congress
was
creating
federalized
contracts.
these
are
not
simply
private
party
agreements.
they
are
federal
regulatory
instruments.
on
the
other
hand,
congress
also
left
room
for
states
to
apply
their
own
consistent
standards
under
section
(e)(5),
and
congress
also
expressly
preserved
existing
state
and
federal
law
to
the
extent
that
it
was
not
expressly
preempted,
so
it's
a
more
difficult
question
whether
these
contracts
are
entirely
federal,
and
we
have
not
take
a--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--we
don't
think
they're
necessary
parties.
we
think
they're
valuable
parties
to
have
because
it
makes
it
easier
to
enforce
the
federal
court
or,
indeed,
a
state
court
judgment,
but
we
think
that
in
the
ordinary
case--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
or
its
enforcement
is
being
enjoined.
typically,
though,
a--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--no.
to
the
extent
that
there
will
be
two
adverse
parties
to
the
proceeding,
one
challenging
the
state
commission's
order
and
one
defending
it,
the
party
defending
the
order
can
ordinarily
be
expected
adequately
to
represent
the
state
commission's
interest.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
and
certainly
federal
statutes
are
often
challenged
in
cases
in
which
the
united
states
is
not
involved.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
that's
the
standard
practice
in
the
federal
system,
and
when
the
fcc
acts
in
the
place
of
a
state
commission
the
fcc's
decisions
will
be
reviewable
in
a
proceeding
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
hobbs
act,
in
which
the
fcc
is
named
as
a
party.
that's
the
standard
procedure,
as
we
understand
it,
and
most
states
as
well,
that
the
agency
issuing
a
decision
will
be
a
party
to
proceedings
challenging
it.
we
don't
see
that
as
essential,
though,
in
this
particular
context.
we
see
no
particular
reason
to
think
the
parties
will
not
abide
by
the
federal
court's
decision,
and
that
the
state
commission
also
will
not
abide
by
that.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
i
could
turn
briefly
to
the
sovereign
immunity
questions,
as
several
courts
of
appeals
have
recognized,
this
is
a
straightforward
ex
parte
young
case
against
state
officials.
the
case
is
seeking
prospective
injunctive
relief
to
include
their
enforcement
of
orders
that
are
alleged
to
be
contrary
to
federal
law.
ex
parte
young
itself
was,
the
underlying
action
was
one
against
state
regulatory
commissioners,
and
there
have
been
many
cases
in
this
court
that
have
involved
federal
challenges
to
state
regulatory
decisions
of
this
nature.
we
see
nothing
in
section
252(e)(6)
or
anything
else
in
the
1996
act
that
suggests
a
congressional
intent
to
preclude
this
sort
of
ex
parte
young--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--from
enforcing
rate
orders
issued
by
the
state
commission.
the
specific
case
before
the
court
was
contempt
sanctions
against
the
attorney
general,
but
the
underlying
case
was
also
against
the
state
regulatory
commissioner.
also,
in
ex
parte
young
the
court
cited
a
number
of
prior
decisions
as
authority,
including
reagan
v.
farmer's
loan
&
trust,
which
was
another
similar
type
of
action
against
state
regulatory
commissioners.
we
have--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--i
think
it--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--as
i
recall,
and
my
understanding
may
be
inaccurate,
the
case
was
brought
before
any
enforcement
action
had
actually
been
threatened
or
taken.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
oh,
i
think
the
attorney
general
was
expected
to
enforce
it.
there
was
a
specific
minnesota
statute,
as
i
recall,
that--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--required
him
to
enforce
the
rate
orders,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
was
critical
to
the
court's
holding.
there
are
many,
many
cases,
including
several,
in
fact,
against
members
of
the
illinois
commerce
commission,
that
have
involved
challenges
under
ex
parte
young
to
rate
orders
and
other
sorts
of
regulatory
orders.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we've
argued
that
as
well,
your
honor.
that's
dependent
on
whether
the
statute
was
sufficiently
clear
to
put
the
state
commissioners
on
notice
that
by
exercising
federal
regulatory
authority
under
the
act
they
would
thereby
be
subject
to
suit
in
federal
court.
