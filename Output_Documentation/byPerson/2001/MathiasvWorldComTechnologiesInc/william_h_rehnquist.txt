chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
00-878,
richard
l.
mathias
v.
worldcom
technologies.
mr.
bertocchi.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
a
patent
case
in
307
u.s.
that
says...
where
the
lower
court
ruled
both
on
infringement
and
on
the
validity
of
the
patent,
and
the
person
who
sought
to...
had
won
on
one
of
them.
this
court
said
you
could
have
a
decision
on
the
other
point.
that
might
be
of
some
help
to
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position
that
the
private
parties
could
have
brought
the
case
to
the
district
court
without
naming
the
commission?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
section
252
in
the
briefs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
isn't
any
federal
law
of
contracts.
there
may
be
a
lot
of
federal
law
of
telecommunications,
but
the
two
could
certainly
be
regarded
as
separate,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
position
on
252
and
in
response
to
your
question
from
justice...
is
very
likely
well-taken.
i
think
your
position
is
1331
is
harder
to
defend.
how
do
you
defend
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
it
suggests
there's
a
large
lacuna
between
the
approval
process
and
the
interpretation
process,
which
is...
you
know,
i
can
understand
how
you
can
construe
252
that
way,
but
i
think
you
have
to
read
252
as
precluding
1331
jurisdiction,
and
i
think
that's
a
more
difficult
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bertocchi.
ms.
mcdowell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let's
look
specifically
at
252,
and
252(6),
where
it
says
in
any
case
in
which
a
state
commission
makes
a
determination
under
this
section,
and
all
the
section
talks
about
is
approval.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
talks
only
about...
you
agree,
don't
you,
that
it...
substantively
it
deals
only
with
the
approval?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
it
talks
about
is
approval.
i
don't
think
you've
answered
my
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
speak
specifically
or
any
other
way
about
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
district
judges
aren't
parties
to
an
appeal
from
their
decisions,
are
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ex
parte
young,
though...
i'm
trying
to
recall
the
facts.
it
was
decided
even
before
i
was
on
the
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
enjoining
a
minnesota
attorney
general,
wasn't
it,
from
doing
something
in
the
future?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mcdowell.
mr.
smith,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
the
commission
is
a
necessary
party,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
bertocchi,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bertocchi.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
case
which
i
have
to
announce
is
no.
00-878,
mathias
versus
worldcom
technologies,
inc.
in
this
case
we
granted
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
consider
three
questions.
we
later
granted
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit
in
verizon
maryland
versus
public
service
commission
of
maryland
and
united
states
versus
public
service
commission
of
maryland
to
review
the
same
questions
arising
in
the
same
factual
contest.
our
decision
in
those
cases
has
just
been
announced
by
justice
scalia.
we
therefore
dismiss
the
writ
in
this
case
as
improvidently
granted.
justice
oâ€™connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
of
decision
of
this
case.
