justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
a
very
preliminary,
quick,
i
hope...
and
i
hope
you'll
have
a
conclusive
answer.
i
can't
get
an
answer.
it's
a
procedural
matter.
i
take
it
you
won
below.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
won
on
the
merits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
i've
always
thought
that
you
appeal
from
a
judgment,
basically.
the
judgment
now
under
the
seventh
circuit
says,
you
win.
but
what
you're
saying
is,
their
reason
was
the
wrong
one.
we
should
have
won
because
there
was
no
jurisdiction
or
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
bar.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
they
gave
for
our
winning
was
wrong.
well,
i
didn't
think
you
could
appeal
that
kind
of
thing.
judges
make
mistakes
in
their
reasoning
all
the
time.
i
do,
too,
and
if
you
could
appeal
from
the
reasoning
of
an
opinion,
as
opposed
to
the
judgment,
we'd
be
here
700
days
a
year,
so...
and
i
can't
find
a
case
where
that
happened,
so
is
that...
and
i
hope
there's
a
conclusive
answer
to
what
i
say,
because
it's
terrible
if
the
case
washes
out
for
that
reason.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
is
there
any
precedent
at
all
where
that's
ever
happened
before?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
you're
in
the
state
court
and
you've
won,
and
they've
sued
you
in
the
state
court,
and
then
suppose
that
their
claim
is
the
following,
the
agreement
as
interpreted
by
the
commission
does
not
meet
the
requirements
of
section
251,
including
the
regulations
prescribed
in
the
fcc
pursuant
to
section
251,
and
then
the
judge
asks
you
this
question:
counsel,
where
is
the
law
that
says
it
has
to
meet
the
requirements
of
section
251,
including
the
regulations
prescribed
by
the
fcc
pursuant
to
section
251?
where
is
that
law?
what
was
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
in
252?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
it...
isn't
the
difficulty
this,
that...
i
mean,
we
don't
lightly
imply
a
negative
on
1331
jurisdiction,
and
it's
perfectly
possible
to
read
the
sentence
in
subsection
(6)
as
simply
saying,
whatever
the
state
commission
may
do
in
applying
these
two
sections
gets
federal
court
review,
and
going
no
further
than
simply
to
make
it
clear
that
you
do
get
federal
court
review
of
it,
in
effect
as
a
regulatory
matter.
if
you
read
it
that
way,
which
the
text
certainly
allows
you
to
do,
1331
stands.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
approvals,
agreements
and
arbitration.
you
would
agree
that
would
be
covered,
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
would
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
my
question,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
order
to
win
your
1331
point,
you
have
to
show
that
congress
really
wanted
this
interpretation
that
you're
giving
of
252,
right,
it
really
wanted
it
and
had
a
pretty
good
reason
for
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
reason?
i
mean,
it
creates
a
pretty
big
mess,
doesn't
it?
we're
going
to
get
into
a
new
jurisprudence
of
what's
an
interpretation
and
what's
an
approval,
and
you're
going
to
start
splitting
the
documents
apart
and
it
sounds
to
me
like
a
mess,
and
i
don't
know
why...
maybe
congress
wrote
those
words,
but
why
would
they
want
such
a
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
also...
would
you
correct...
as
long
as
we're
on
ex
parte
young,
as
i
understand
it,
in
ex
parte
young,
there
was
no
action
brought
until
the
executive
branch
of
the
state
said,
we're
going
to
take
certain
action
here
in
accordance
with
this
order.
in
other
words,
they...
ex
parte
young
was
not
brought
immediately
upon
the
issuance
of
the
state
rate
order--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
simply
to
review
the
order.
it
was
brought
because
a...
somebody
in
a
different
branch
or
agency
of
the
government
said,
oh,
now
we
are
going
to
take
some
action
under
that
which
is,
in
effect,
going
to
hurt
the
person
who
brought
the
ex
parte
young
action.
is
my
understanding
correct?
