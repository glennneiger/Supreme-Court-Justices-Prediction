mr.
paul
m.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
complaint
that
ameritech
filed
in
this
case
in
federal
court
specifically
alleged
not
only
that
the
icc
had
misinterpreted
the
interconnection
agreements
at
issue,
but
also
that
its
order
requiring
payment
of
reciprocal
compensation
for
a
particular
category
of
calls
violated
several
specific
sections
of
the
telecommunications
act
as
well
as
several
allegedly
applicable
fcc
rulings.
for
that
reason,
our
position,
and
i'm
arguing
today
for
worldcom
and
several
other
companies
who
had
signed
interconnection
agreements
with
ameritech
and
also
were
sued
as
codefendants
along
with
the
icc,
our
position
is
that
the
complaint
stated
straightforward
preemption
claims
alleging
ongoing
violations
of
federal
law
by
state
officials
and
therefore
those
claims
were
within
federal
jurisdiction
and
also
actionable
notwithstanding
the
eleventh
amendment.
where
we
differ
with
ameritech
and
actually
with
the
final
respondent
at&t
is
on
the
question
that
was
being
discussed
earlier,
which
is
the
scope
of
valid
federal
claims
in
enforcement
cases,
and
specifically
whether
a
claim
of
mere
misinterpretation
of
an
interconnection
agreement
raises
any
federal
issue
or
not.
our
position
is
that
in
most
cases,
at
least,
a
claim
of
misinterpretation
of
an
interconnection
agreement
would
raise
claims
only
under
state
common
law
contracts
and
therefore
has
to
be
treated
as
a
state
law
claim,
but
in
terms
of
this
case,
since
the
contract...
the
complaint
did
allege
violations
of
the
statute
and
fcc
rulings,
there
certainly
was
jurisdiction,
we
believe.
now,
let
me
turn
first
to
the
jurisdiction
issue,
and
then
i
want
to
get
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
certainly
it
ought
to
be
done
by
virtue
of
some
analysis
of
the
intent
of
the
parties,
if
it's
a
negotiated
agreement.
there
also
are
agreements
which
are
imposed
through
arbitration,
and
then
the
commission
is
essentially
analyzing
its
own
intent
in
imposing--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
congress,
your
honor,
very
specifically
turns
over
responsibility
for
developing
these
contracts,
reviewing
them,
to
state
commissions,
and
in
the
process
of
doing
that
says
that
while
the
state
commissions
have
to
follow
various
substantive
standards
in
251,
they
also
are
authorized
in
more
than
one
place
in
the
act
to
impose
their
own
policies
that
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
federal
policies,
and
it
also
said
the
parties
can
negotiate
agreements
notwithstanding
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
act,
and
that
the
state
commission
can't
overturn
them
unless
they
find
that
they
violate
the
public
interest
and
necessity.
so
what
you
have
here
is
a
very
clear
recognition
by
congress
that
they
want
these
to
be
real
contracts,
not
merely
orders
applying
federal
standards,
and
that
there
will
be
lots
of
issues
which
under
this
court's
ruling
should
be
viewed
as
state
law
contract
issues
that
will
come
up
in
the
enforcement
proceedings,
so
we
don't
see
any
basis
under
jackson
transit
and
this
court's
other
cases
dealing
with
the
development
of
federal
common
law
for
saying
that
the
contract
interpretation
rules,
the
rules
for
determining
how
the
contract
ought
to
be
read,
ought
to
be
elaborated
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
in
the
federal
courts
rather
than
through
analysis
of
state
common
law
which
already
exists.
now,
these
cases
will
be
sometimes
in
federal
court
and
sometimes
in
state
court,
because
there
will
be
some
times
when
there
are
federal
claims
that
are
brought
that
can
sustain
a
motion
to
dismiss.
i
don't
happen
to
think
these
claims
would
have
sustained
a
motion
to
dismiss,
but--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
see
that
as
a
federal
question,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
that
is
essentially
what
ameritech
claimed
here.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
rejected
that
on
the
merits,
but
their
claim
was
that
this
interpretation
was
barred
by
the
fcc's
interpretation
of
the
act.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
their
claim
was
that
even
if
that
is
what
the
parties
intended,
that
federal
law
had
evolved
to
the
point
where
that
was
preempted
by
congress,
or
by
the
fcc.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i'm
not
sure
i
really
meant
to
say
that
every
case
becomes
a
federal
case.
i
think
there
are
lots
of
situations
in
which
the
interpretation
as
done
by
the
commission
is
then
a
matter...
whether
that's
correct
or
not
is
a
state
law
issue.
what
i
meant
to
answer
in
response
to
your
question
was
then,
if
a
party
says
that
interpretation
of
what
the
parties
really
intended
has
somehow
brought
the
contract
into
some
inconsistency
with
applicable
fcc
regulations,
that's
a
federal
claim.
at
the
same
time,
if
the
commission
says,
we
think
they
probably
intended
this,
but
we're
not
going
to
do
that
because
we
think
federal
law
requires
us
to
do
y
instead
of
x,
that
also
raises
a
federal
question.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
but
if
they're
merely
looking
at
the
intent,
there
will
be
lots
of
situations
where
there
isn't
any
federal
preemption
because
the
law,
after
all,
says
if
you
negotiate
it,
the
substantive
provisions
of
251
don't
apply.
in
most
of
those
situations,
you're
going
to
have
state
law
contract
issues
which
will
be
then
analyzed
by
the
state
commission
and,
absent
some
additional
federal
issue
that
comes
along,
the
place
where
that
would
be
appealed
would
be
the
state
court,
in
my
understanding.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
unless
there
was
some
odd
situation
involving
diversity,
my
sense
is...
my
understanding
is--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
under
jackson
transit,
that
the
fact
that
the
federal
statute
requires
that
a
contract
exists
but
doesn't
specify
the
terms
of
the
contract,
in
that
situation
the
contract
itself
remains
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
actually,
as
to
negotiated
contracts,
the
federal
standards--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--are
very,
very
loose.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it
has
to
either
be
discriminatory
or
a
violation
of
public
interest,
which
is...
and
the
specific
rules
of
251
don't
apply.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
would
view
that
as
something
that
is
authorizing
the
state
commission
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--to
apply
its...
no,
obviously,
they
can
look
at
federal
policies
if
they
want
to,
but
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
it's
inherently
federal
in
the
way
that
the
solicitor
general
does.
now,
there
are
other
situations
that
could
come
up.
a
contract
could
expressly
incorporate
federal
law,
and
that
might
or
might
not
create
a
federal
claim.
this
court
has
wrestled
for
100
years
with
the
issue
of
when
federal
law
incorporated
into
state
law
causes
of
action
do
or
don't
create
federal
question
jurisdiction.
in
other
situations,
the
state
commission
might
have
imposed
the
terms
of
the
contract
in
an
area
where
the
parties
didn't
agree,
and
in
that
situation,
if
they
are
imposing
it
by
virtue
of
their
interpretation
of
the
federal
regulations,
and
then
that
particular
clause
is
later
interpreted
in
some
way
that
deviates
from
the
federal
regulations,
that
might
well
be
a
federal
claim
as
well.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
there
have
been
assertions,
your
honor,
that
that's
the
case.
my
reading
of
these
contracts
is
that
they
make...
that
they...
and
certainly
in
this
case,
the
illinois
case,
it
specifically
gives
a
definition
of
when
reciprocal
compensation
will
be
paid,
and
both
the
commission
and
the
two
lower
courts
all
said
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
has
been
an
incorporation
of
federal
regulations.
this
is
a
case
where
we
can
divine
the
actual
intent
of
the
parties,
that
these
calls
should
be
treated
as
calls
where
this
compensation
would
be
paid.
and
so
what
they
said
was,
this
is
not
an
incorporation
case,
and
i
believe
the
contract
in
the
verizon
case,
to
come
next,
is
the
same,
that
there
was
an
intent
at
the
time
that
was...
that
the
state
commissions
have
said
we're
going
to
hold
you
to...
even
though
federal
law
may
have
moved
on,
every
time
it
moves
on
they
say,
if
you
agreed
to
something
else,
you're
still
stuck
with
it,
and
that's
what
the
courts
in
both
of
these
cases
have
said
as
well
as
the
commissions.
maybe
if
i
could
turn,
then,
to
the
eleventh
amendment
issues,
it
is
certainly
our
view
that
the
five
circuits
that
have
said
these
cases
present
straightforward
ex
parte
young
cases,
those
circuits
are
correct,
because
they
do
involve,
in
situations
where
there
is
a
federal
claim
being
asserted
against
an
action
of
a
state
commission,
either
an
enforcement
case
or
an
approval
case,
a
claim
seeking
an
order
bringing
the
state
commission
into
compliance
with
federal
law,
and
it
is,
i
think,
an
ongoing
violation
of
federal
law,
because
when
they
approve
and
enforce
an
interconnection
agreement,
or
they
enforce
it
in
some
way,
interpret
it
in
some
way,
they
are
then
telling
the
parties
that
they
have
to
live
by
that
interpretation
during
the
term
of
the
agreement.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it's
our
position
that
they
are
a
necessary
party,
but
to
use
the
technical
term
under
the
federal
rules,
if
there
was
a
reason
why
they
can't
be
sued
and
that
the
case
can't
go
forward,
then
they
may
not
be
an
indispensable
party.
the
distinction
is
drawn
in
rule
19
between
those
two.
certainly,
they've--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but
what
makes
them
a
necessary
party
is
that
the
private
parties
have
an
interest
in
having
the
administrative
body
that
has
told
them
to
do
x
be
bound
by
a
ruling
from
the
federal
court
which
they're
trying
to
get
which
says
don't
do
x,
do
y,
and
that--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--and
the
reason
why
a
federal
district
court
is
not
named
as
a
defendant
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
power
in
a
unitary
system
to
direct
the
district
court
to
do
something.
when
a
federal
court,
though,
is--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--right,
but
i
think--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--it
may
be
factually
true
that
most
of
the
time
state
commissions
will
obey
federal
courts,
but
100
years
of
jurisprudence
under
ex
parte
young
and
before
all
follow
the
federal
administrative
model
and
say
that
as
to
federal...
state
executive
officials,
when
they
violate
federal
law,
that
you
name
them
as
a
defendant.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
though,
the...
a
large
number
of
these
ex
parte
young
cases,
going
back
to
the
reagan
v.
farmer's
loan
case
that
ms.
mcdowell
mentioned,
an
ex
parte
young,
cases
involving
rate-making
commissions,
railroad
commissions
and
others
that
are...
have
always
been
named
as
the
defendants.
in
their
official
capacity
the
individuals
are
named,
and
that
reagan
case
in
1894
said
that's
not
an
eleventh
amendment
problem.
you're
not
really
suing
the
state,
you're
suing
them
to
bring
them
into
compliance
with
the
federal
statute.
ex
parte
young,
the
defendants
included
not
just
the
attorney
general
but
also
the
rate-making
commissioners,
and
that
is
just
the
way
it's
done,
and
i
don't
think
it
has
any,
as
you
have
suggested,
any
great
intrusion
on
the
sovereign
interests
of
the
state
to
have
them
named.
in
fact,
that's
the
essence
of
ex
parte
young,
that
it's
not
an
intrusion
on
their
interests
to
have
them
brought
into
compliance
under
the
supremacy
clause,
and
it
would
be,
i
think,
an
odd
rule
to
say,
well,
we're
going
to
start
having
review
of
state
actions,
or
some
category
of
state
actions
in
federal
court
for
compliance
with
federal
law
where
we
don't
name
the
defendants
as...
the
state
as...
state
individuals
as
defendants.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
now,
there's
been
a
number
of
other
arguments
raised
against
the
application
of
ex
parte
young
here.
i
don't
think
any
of
them
is
very
substantial.
there's
a
notion
that
somehow
there's
an
elaborate
remedial
scheme
here
comparable
to
the
one
in
seminole
tribe,
but
in
fact
there
isn't
any
elaborate
remedial
scheme
in
the
statute.
it
just
says
you
can
sue
state
commissions
in
federal
court,
or
to
the
extent
we're
relying
on
1331,
there's
no
scheme
at
all.
we
also
have
an...
the
invocation
of
the
larson
case
which
was
discussed
by
this
court
in
detail
in
pennhurst.
larson,
i
believe,
is
the
case
that
you
apply
in
a
situation
where
you
don't
have
supremacy
clause
considerations
at
stake.
essentially,
what
the
court
said
in
pennhurst
is,
when
the
supremacy
clause
is
at
issue,
we
basically
allow
lawsuits
to
proceed
against
all
prospective
ongoing
violations
of
federal
law
by
state
officials,
but
larson
provides
a
test
that
says
where
you're
suing
without
supremacy
clause
considerations
to
enforce
state
law
against
state
officials
or
federal
law
against
federal
officials,
in
that
situation
you
try
to
differentiate
between
mere
violations
of
federal
law
and
violations
that
are
so
serious
that
we
won't
treat
the
state
official
or
the
federal
official
as
an
agent
of
the
state
any
more.
that
is
not
the
test
that
ought
to
be
applied
under
ex
parte
young,
and
certainly
has
not
been
applied
in
the
past.
we
also
have
the
fourth
circuit's
analysis
in
which
it
undertook
an
entire
sort
of
ad
hoc
balancing
test
trying
to
weigh
state
interests
against
federal
interests.
i
think
this
court
is
clearly
on
record
as
saying
that
in
the
ex
parte
young
context
we're
not
going
to
get
into
that
kind
of
balancing
test.
the
balancing
test
of
the
fourth
circuit
i
thought
was
particularly
unfortunate,
because
basically
what
that
court
did
is,
it
looked
at
the
merits
of
the
case
and
said,
well,
we
don't
think
that
the
federal
claims
are
very
strong
here,
so
therefore
we're
going
to
say
there's
no
ability
to
sue
the
state
under
ex
parte
young,
and
that
doesn't
seem
like
a
very
helpful
way
to
go
about...
thank
you,
your
honor.
