i
suppose
i
suppose
that
the
government
didn't
think
of
what
it
was
doing
as
giving
an
extra
twelve
weeks
of
leave.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i'm
assuming.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it,
would
have
been
a
better
remedy
if
the
agency
had
said,
and
if
you
don't
tell
them,
you
have
to
pay
them
ten
thousand
dollars
cash.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh
well,
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thousand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thousand
dollars
cash
to
any
employee
because
the
notice
provision
wasn't
given,
and
all
small
employers,
large
employers,
any
time
they
fail
to
to
now,
would
you
have
but
you
would
have
preferred
that
remedy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
trying
to
make
to
to
try
to
understand,
to
put
you
in
the
position
of
the
agency.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
count
it
as
leave.
