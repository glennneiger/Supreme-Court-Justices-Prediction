mr.
luther
o.
sutter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fmla
guarantees
much
more
than
twelve
weeks
of
absence
from
work.
the
fmla
guarantees
a
specific
bundle
of
statutory
rights
that
an
employer
must
grant
eligible
employees.
in
many
cases,
the
company's
leave
plan,
as
is
the
case
here,
may
provide
different
rights
from
the
bundle
of
rights
that
in
the
fml-
that
the
fmla
grants
eligible
employees.
eight
twenty-five
two
oh
eight
and
eight
twenty-five
seven
hundred
a
implement
the
statute
in
an
in
an
important
way.
under
the
regulations,
eight
twenty-five
two
oh
eight
and
seven
hundred,
if
the
employer
wants
a
period
of
absences
or
leave
to
count
against
a
worker's
annual
fmla
entitlement,
the
employer
must
do
three
things.
first,
the
company
must
decide
to
grant
the
worker
this
bundle
of
rights
that
the
fmla
grants
him
or
her.
second,
the
employer
must
tell
the
employee
that
they
have
these
bundle
of
rights,
and
third,
the
employer
must
tell
the
employee
that
the
employ-
the
employer
has
elected
to
count
this
period
of
leave
against
the
fmla.
[inaudible]
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
yeh-
yes,
justice
o'connor,
it
does.
twenty-nine
usc
twenty-six
nineteen
provides
that
each
employer
shall
post
a
general
notice
in
the
form
that
the
secretary
shall
prescribe,
so
congress
painted
in
in
in
broad
brush
brush
strokes
and
intended
that
the
secretary
had
the
ability
to
provide
what
information
is
provided
to
employees.
[inaudible]
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
well,
your
honor,
that
is
just
as
this
court
noted
in
the
f
in
f
in
the
fda
case,
just
simply
because
the
secretary
has
spoken
and
required
posting
in
this
instance
does
not
mean
that
the
secretary
cannot
fill
the
gap,
as
it
were
and
require
personal
notice
if
the
secretary
determines
that
such
notice
is
reasonably
necessary
to
implement
the
act.
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
all
would
agree
that
it
is
difficult
to
exercise
a
right
that
one
does
not
know
that
one
has,
and
in
this
case
the
secretary
decided
that
the
employer
must
first
choose
to
that
the
fmla
that
the
worker
will
get
the
fmla
rights,
and
then
tell
the
employee,
and
this
regulation
promotes
communication,
communication
between
the
employer
and
the
employee.
[inaudible]
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
justice
ginsburg,
the
thrust
of
my
argument
is,
is
that
the
fmla
is
more
than
just
twelve
weeks.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
yes.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
well,
i
can
see
where
one
might
believe
that
it
is
a
bit
odd,
but
again,
justice
ginsburg,
the
company
leave
plan
in
this
case
did
not
provide
her
with
all
of
the
fmla
bundle
of
rights.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
because
the
the
l-
leave
plan
in
this
case,
for
example,
did
not
allow
her
to
have
intermittent
leave.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
well,
justice
scalia,
the
doctor
only
had
two
options.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
well,
an...
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
well,
justice
scalia,
we
it
is
difficult,
looking
three,
four
years
later,
to
determine
whether
or
not
ms.
ragsdale
would
have
been
able
to
work
intermittently.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
well,
certainly
the
district
court
did
not
address
the
issue
of
prejudice.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
right.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
no,
no
justice
kennedy,
i
do
not
believe
that
we
are,
because
in
this
case,
while
the
statute
explicitly
requires
twelve
weeks
of
leave
in
any
period,
twenty-six
twelve
b
one
also
allows
employees
to
extend
that
twelve
weeks
over
a
calendar
year
using
intermittent
leave,
so
looking
at
this
case
as
simply
a
calculation
of
weeks
is
inaccurate.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
s-
specific
issue
here
is
what
happens
when
the
employer
provides
the
employee
with
less
rights
w-
than
the
fmla
bundle
of
rights
provides.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy,
in
terms
of
time
i
believe
the
court
is
correct.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
the
secretary
may
have
reasonably
required
that
this
analysis
occur
after
the
need
for
for
intermittent
leave
arose.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
under
either
a
morning
prophylactic
rule,
or
the
interpretive
powers
granted
the
secretary
under
chevron,
we
believe
the
regulation
is
entirely
appropriate
because
the
issue
of
notice
is
not
addressed.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
if
the
employee
does
not
need...
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
not
unless,
for
example,
she
is
involved
in
a
a
serious
car
accident,
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
that's
exactly
correct,
justice.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
yes,
and
that's
an
that's
an
entirely
reasonable
interpretation,
a
a
reasonable
alternative
to
what
the
secretary
did
here,
but
that
is
not
the
just-
i-
judge
mcgill
did
not
give
the
secretary
the
appropriate
deference
that
she
is
entitled
to
in
promulgating
this
regulation.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
the
company
granted
four
weeks
pre-
fmla
eligibility
and
twenty-six
weeks
post.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
well,
and
y-
as
this
court
recognized
in
f
in
in
the
fda
case,
you
cannot
read
one
statute
in
isolation.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
the
company
never
gave
the
doctor
the
option
to
allow
miss
ragsdale
to
work
intermittently.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
yes,
justice,
but
there
is
also
a
a
provision
for
appropriate
injunctive
relief
such
as
reinstatement
and
other
and
relief
as
the
court
may
deem
appropriate,
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that,
as
one
of
the
justices
recognized,
this
is
not
simply
about
money.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
well,
that's
true,
justice
o'connor,
but
the
regula-
the
regulatory
scheme
provides
that
the
employer
should
have
given
her
a
date
by
which
she
would
have
been
eligible
for
fmla
leave.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
and
that
is
why
that
is
why
that
is
why
congress
required
the
fmla...
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
of
course
it
is,
and
it
might
be
entirely
reasonable
for
me
to
stand
up
here
and
substitute
my
judgment
for
the
secretary's,
but
it
is
also
equally
reasonable
that
the
company
be
allowed
the
benefit
of
making
this
determination,
and
to
the
to
say
that
the
requirement
that
employees
communicate
is
in-
is
inferred,
we
disagree,
because
you
see,
twenty-six
twelve
twenty-six
eleven
requires
communication
for
planning
when
intermittent
leave
is
required.
mr.
luther
o.
sutter
thank
you.
