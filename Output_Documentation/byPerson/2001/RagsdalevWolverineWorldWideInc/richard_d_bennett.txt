mr.
richard
d.
bennett
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
again,
the
issue,
as
justice
scalia
has
pointed
out,
is
not
is
not
the
requirement...
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
congress
specified
a
monetary
penalty.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
i
think
the
some
employers
may
object
to
the
to
the
amount
of
the
penalty,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
i
i...
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
well,
aside
from
constitutional
issues
as
a
p-
penalty,
i
believe
we
have
to
look
at
what
congress
intended.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
[inaudible]
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
i
believe
the
agency
does
have
a
range
to
choose
what's
reasonable,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
believe...
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
well,
again,
one
of
the
contingents
we
raise,
your
honor,
is
that
congress
specifically
spoke
to
notice,
all
the
notice
that's
required
under
the
statute.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
again,
u-
the
secretary
can
exercise
the
discretion
to
determine
a
fashion
a
reasonable
remedy
for
the
company's
failure
to
to
provide
this
u-
this
notice,
but
that
remedy,
your
honor,
cannot...
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
your
honor,
i
i
believe
the
o-
the
penalty
that
de-
u-
that
the
secretary
should
have
granted
in
this
particular
case,
or
authorized
under
this
regulation,
would
be
a
monetary
penalty.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
there
would
be.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
i
suppose,
in
those...
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
what
we
con-
we
contend,
your
honor,
they
could
not.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
correct,
your
honor,
but
if,
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
provided
the
leave
already
granted
provided
provided
the
employee
had
already
been
given
twelve
weeks
of
leave
under
the
conditions
contained
within
the
statute,
your
honor,
that
is
our
contention.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
your
honor,
that's
not
our
s-
u-
specific
case,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
your
honor,
we
i-
again,
under
the
statute,
if
you
read
the
statute,
and
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
surrounding
the
statute,
im-
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
statute
congress
specifically
noted
in
the
legislative
history
that
united
states
stood
alone
in
the
industrialized
world
as
not
having
leave
for
these
particular
types
of
conditions.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
y-
your
honor,
we
n-
n-
n-
n-
that
is
a
a
a
good
point
that
your
honor
makes.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
the
statute
deals
with
that,
your
honor,
in
the
u-
section
d-
dealing
with
interference.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
yes,
your
honor,
we
posted
the
statutory
notices,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
because
my
client
has
a
i-
its
own
company
provided
leave
policy,
this
is
within
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
it's
also
within
the
employee
handbook,
so
the
employees
were
aware
of
it
through
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
through
the
employee
handbook
which
was
handed
out
along
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
all
employees.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
i
do
not
believe
there
was
any
specific
reference
to
the
fmla
notice
posting,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
not
by
the
company,
your
honor,
but
the
statute
doesn't
require
that.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
i
believe
there
was
there
was
a
notice
on
these
regulations
when
they
came
out
initially,
and
then
they
issued
final
regulations,
and
u-
i
can't
speak
d-
directly
as
to
the
comments
that
were
all
the
comments
that
were
made
about
this
one
particular
regulation,
but
i
believe
the
dol
in
their
brief
does
mention
that
there
was
not
an
objection
specific
objection
by
employers
to
that,
and
i
i
believe
that
to
be
accurate,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
believe
and
i
i
n-
n-
i
can
attest
for
my
client's
purpose
that
we
did
rec-
r-
recognize
from
reading
that
that
that
what
we
were
going
to
have
to
do
was
grant
additional
leave,
additional
leave,
that
we're
not
going
to
be
able
to
grant
additionally,
that
we're
going
to
have
to
grant
addition
leave
over
an-
above
what
we've
given.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
no,
justice
ginsburg,
it
was
not.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
your
honor,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
i-
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
if
the
employee
was
given
the
leave,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
leave
counts.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
you
didn't
hold
their
job
open...
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
the
it's
not
like,
as
if
the
leave
doesn't
count.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
an
additional
twelve
weeks
plus
damages...
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
giving
them
their
job
back.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
your
honor,
the
s-
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
department
of
labor
provide
that
if
an
employer
s-
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
no,
sir,
they're
they're
i-
tha-
tha-
that's...
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
your
honor,
i
believe
the
statute
itself
creates
a
default
rule.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
for
the
unpaid.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
i-
in
twenty-six
twelve
c
and
twenty-six
twelve
d
one,
the
statute
specifically
talks
about
unpaid
leave,
that
leave
shall
be
unpaid.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
i-
t-
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
the-
i-
their
assumption
is
that
there's
a
gap
and
that
it's
reasonable
for
them
to
step
in.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
position,
your
honor,
is
that
congress
specifically
decided
not
to
require
that.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
well
your
but
justice
souter,
the
statute
is
not
silent.
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
that's...
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
be
it
paid
or...
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
that's
that's...
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
that's
in
the
statute,
that's...
mr.
richard
d.
bennett
there
are
many
employers
out
there
who
such
as
my
client
who
have
more
generous
leave
policies.
