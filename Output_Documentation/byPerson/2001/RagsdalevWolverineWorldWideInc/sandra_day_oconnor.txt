does
the
act
require
the
posting
of
some
general
notice
in
the
place

about

well,
can
the
secretary
then
provide
that
it
has
to
be
done
by
personal
communication?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
that
can
be
met
by
just
posting
some
general
notice
saying
that
any
leave
taken
by
an
em-
an
employee
is
going
to
require
taking
fmla
leave
first?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
course,
you
couldn't
really
do
it
on
the
front
end
here
because
she
wasn't
eligible
originally
for
fmla
leave.
