mr.
justice
ruth
bader

sutter,
mistuh-
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
if
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
the
employee
initially
did
not
qualify
for
the
fmla
leave
because
she
hadn't
been
there
long
enough.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
that's
a
separate
question,
but
let's
assume
that
there's
no
difference
in
the
rights
under
each,
and
in
this
case
i
don't
know
that
that
bundle
that
you
describe
is
any
different
under
the
company
plan
as
far
as
continuing
the
insurance
and
the
pension
payments,
but
is
it
your
contention
that
she
would
therefore,
because
she
didn't
have
enough
to
qualify
her
for
the
fmla
leave,
she
would
get
sixteen
weeks...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
a
little
odd
that
when
she
didn't
qualify
she
gets
extra
time
than
if
she
had
already
been
there
long
enough
to
qualify,
in
which
case
it
would
be
only
twelve
weeks.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
understood
what
judge
mcgill
said
in
the
eighth
circuit,
he
did
say
that
he
there
could
be
cases
where
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
regulation
to
apply
if
she
could
show
that
she
was
that
she
was
disadvantaged
by
not
being
given
the
option,
and
he
so
he
left
that
door
open
if
there
were
some
disadvantage.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
his
reason,
i-
i
understand,
was
that
congress
said
twelve
weeks,
and
to
interpret
that
statute
that
says
twelve
weeks
to
mean
twenty-four
weeks,
or
in
this
case
even
more
than
that
because
the
company
leave
was
thirty
weeks,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
his
view
was
that
the
regulation
conflicted
with
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here
there's
there's
something
really
strange
about
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
any
noncompliance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
stewart,
suppose
somebody
has
worked
for
five
months
but
the
company
has
leave
that
kicks
in
that
early,
and
then
seven
months
later
would
qualify
for
the
f
m
l
l
but
or
has
already
had
much
more
than
the
twelve
weeks
of
leave,
hasn't
been
given
notice
because
there
wasn't
any
eligibility,
what
happens
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
the
could
the
agency
choose
a
a
monetary
penalty?
could
the
agency
as
a
matter
of
administrative
discretion
impose
a
a
penalty,
or
would
that
have
to
come
from
the
is
is
that
even
within
the
realm
of
choice
that
the
agency
would
have?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
assume
that
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
secretary
to
say,
give
them
notice
that
the
leave
counts
as
this
for
this
purpose,
that
that
would
be
permissible.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
w-
what
does
the
secretary
have
in
her
arsenal
to
put
teeth
behind
that,
if
if
if
not
the
extension
of
the
period?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
be
reasonable?
y-
i-
th-
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
question
was
the
secretary
has
authority
to
do
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
argument
in
the
brief
that
that
that
she
could
have
initially
had
the
company
leave
when
she
wasn't
eligible
yet,
and
then
she
could
have
said
at
that
point,
four
weeks
later
when
she
became
eligible
for
the
fmla
leave,
she
could
say,
okay,
company,
stop
the
company
leave.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
if
the
requirement
was
so
difficult
to
deal
with,
one
would
expect
there
would
have
been
some
comment
to
that
effect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that,
because
that's
what
the
regulation
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
requirement
that
went
beyond
what
the
federal
act
requires.
