in

so
that
during

that

off
the

counts
that
for
purposes
of
monetary
liability,
but
it
doesn't
count
that
for

she's

would
there
ever
be
an
instance
in
which
the
secretary,
on
a
case

could
say
that
we
are
g-
i-
ordering
you
to
grant
additional

suppose
the

knows
that

does
make
a
difference
t-
in
answering
the
question
whether

can

standard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
involves
an
employee
and
employer
who
were
covered
by
the
family
and
medical
leave
act
--
that
is
federal
statute
is
which
sometimes
referred
to
as
fmla
--
under
the
act,
the
employees
are
guaranteed
12
weeks
of
unpaid
leave
each
year
for
certain
specified
purposes
and
the
employer
here,
wolverine
world
wide
inc.
granted
its
employee
and
her
name
is
tracy
ragsdale
30-weeks
of
leave
when
her
cancer
condition
kept
her
out
of
work
in
1996.
so,
the
act
requires
12
weeks
the
employer
granted
30
weeks.
the
employer
however
did
not
designate
in
advance
that
the
leave
she
took
would
count
as
fmla
leave
as
a
regulation
of
the
department
of
labor
requires
the
employer
to
do.
ragsdale
sued
the
employer
containing
that
because
no
advance
notice
was
given
to
her,
she
was
entitled
to
12
more
weeks
of
leave.
under
her
theory
this
additional
leave
and
not
the
leave
she
had
taken
would
be
the
fmla
leave.
a
specific
regulation
issued
by
the
secretary
of
labor
supported
her
position.
the
employer
asserted
that
the
regulation
requiring
the
additional
leave
in
every
case
where
notice
is
not
given
but
without
any
injury
to
the
employee
was
invalid
because
it
was
beyond
the
secretary’s
authority
under
the
act.
the
district
court
agreed
that
the
regulation
was
invalid
and
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
employer.
the
court
of
appeals
also
agreed
with
the
employer
disposition
and
we
now
affirm.
the
secretary’s
regulation
is
inconsistent
with
the
structure
of
the
act.
the
act
allows
employees
to
sue
employers
but
it
requires
that
the
employees
show
that
their
rights
under
the
statute
were
violated
and
that
they
suffered
some
specific
injury.
in
the
case
at
hand,
the
employee’s
rights
were
not
violated
and
she
suffered
no
injury.
she
would
have
taken
the
entire
30-week
absence
even
if
the
employer
had
complied
with
the
notice
requirement.
the
regulation
nevertheless
transformed
the
company’s
failure
to
give
notice
along
with
its
refusal
to
grant
her
more
than
30-weeks
of
leave
into
an
actionable
violation
of
the
statute.
furthermore
the
secretary’s
penalty
amends
that
fmla's
most
fundamental
substantive
guarantee
the
employee’s
entitlement
to
a
total
of
12-work
weeks
of
leave
during
any
12
month
period.
the
12
week
figure
was
the
result
of
compromise
between
groups
with
marked
but
divergent
interests.
the
secretary’s
chosen
penalty
subverts
the
careful
balance,
for
it
gives
certain
employee
a
right
to
more
than
12
weeks
of
fmla
compliant
leave.
in
defense
of
the
regulation,
the
government
notes
that
a
categorical
penalty
requiring
the
employer
to
grant
more
leave
is
easier
to
administer
than
one
involving
a
fact
specific
inquiry
into
what
steps
the
employee
would
have
taken
had
the
employer
given
the
required
notice.
regardless
of
how
serious
the
problem
an
administrative
agency
seeks
to
address,
however,
it
may
not
exercise
its
authority
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
administrative
structure
congress
enacted
into
law.
these
and
other
considerations
explained
in
the
opinion
persuade
us
that
the
regulation
cannot
be
within
the
secretary’s
priority
issue
rules
necessary
to
carry
out
the
act.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
affirmed.
justice
o’connor
has
written
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
souter,
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined.
