wasn't
able
to
have
intermittent
leave
anyway,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
doctor
skewed
his
medical
advice
and
and
told
her
you
can't
work
at
all
only
because
the
employer
hadn't
told
her
she
could
work
intermittently?
i
ca-
i
can't
imagine
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
problem
i
have
with
your
case
is
is
not
not
the
i-
the
rule
that
the
employer
has
to
give
notice.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
act
you
have
to
prove
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
agree
that
that's
the
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
rule
that
the
secretary's
adopted,
even
though
the
statute
itself,
in
the
provisions
that
it
that
it
sets
forth
for
where
the
employer
has
failed
to
comply
with
the
act,
does
not
adopt
a
prophylactic
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
but
where
the
employee
has
no
fmla
rights,
that
is
to
say,
where
the
leave
that
the
employer
provides
gives
the
employee
everything
that
the
employee
would
have
under
the
f
fmla,
why
should
the
employee
get
another
twelve
weeks?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
is
not
the
requirement
of
i-
t-
to
my
mind
i-
is
not
the
requirement
of
notice
that
a-
a-
at
the
beginning
of
the
leave.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
i'm
i
i
i
agree
that
that
that
those
are
questions,
but
it
seems
to
me
those
are
questions
that
that
that
have
to
be
answered
by
by
the
person
who
is
seeking
to
impose
a
liability
on
the
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
prophylactic
rule,
an-
and
e-
which
the
statute
itself
does
not
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
had
no
rights,
he's
not
guilty
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
sure
i'm
not
sure
it's
it's
incumbent
upon
you
to
to
write
a
regulation
for
the
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
employer's
leave
doesn't
precisely
mirror
the
statutory
requirements?
for
example,
what
if
the
employer's
leave
does
not
allow
intermittent
leave?
it
says,
you've
got
to
take
your
your
twelve
weeks
in
in
one
big
lump.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
employer's
leave
does
does
not
does
not
comply
with
all
of
the
conditions,
all
right,
that
that
are
required
by
the
act,
and
the
employee
goes
off
on
that
leave,
and
there's
no
notification
that
the
employee
could
get
more,
could
have
the
benefits
continued
or
what
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
leave
count?
it
doesn't
count
as
as
as
statutory
leave,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
the
damage
provision
would
cut...
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
you're
saying
it's
it's
it's
a
false
it's
a
false
question
as
as
as
to
whether,
when
the
employee
takes
leave,
he's
taking
f
l
m
fmla
leave
or
employer's
leave,
that
that
that
that
there
aren't
two
categories?
justice
antonin
scalia
give
the
notice
in
order
that
the
employee
can
know
which
of
the
two
leaves
he's
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
leave
counts
under
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
you
haven't
provided
in
connection
with
the
leave
everything
that
the
statute
requires,
such
as
a
person
can
come
back
to
the
same
job
and
so

there's
a
damages
