justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
go
back
to
the
question
of
of
what
the
damages
are?
on
your
view,
or
on
the
secretary's
view,
does
the
employee
get
another
twelve
weeks
of
leave
if
the
employee
does
not
need
another
twelve
weeks
of
leave?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
the
employee
is
cured.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
whatever
the
reason
for
the
leave
was,
sickness
or
pregnancy
leave,
whatever,
it's
it's
over,
so
that
i
take
it
that
the
the
additional
twelve
weeks,
are
only
an
additional
twelve
weeks,
if
the
person
still
has
some
medical
or
social
need
for
the
leave.
justice
david
h.
souter
there-
s-
fore
saying
that
even
the
notice
provision
i-
is
is
beyond
the
st-
secretary's
power?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
that's
what
what
you
were
suggesting
a
moment
ago.
justice
david
h.
souter
cannot
even
require
a
notice?
justice
david
h.
souter
period
chosen
in
this
case
because
the
employer's
regulation
says
we'll
only
do
it
for
thirty
days
at
a
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
no
provision,
but
neither
is
there
any
clear
answer
to
the
question,
and
i
suppose
one
of
the
the
arguments
in
favor
of
the
secretary's
regulation
here
is
that
it
really
was
a
gap
filling
regulation
with
respect
to
unpaid
company
leave.
justice
david
h.
souter
for
for
unp-
when
when
the
company's
leave
is
unpaid?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
it,
the
default
rule,
again?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that
that
as
i
understand
it,
that
addresses
the
the
issue
of
w-
b-
the
character
of
the
leave,
if
there
isn't
a
full
twelve
weeks
provided,
but
as
i
understand
it
also
there
is
no
clear
default
provision
when
we
have
a
situation
in
which
there
could
be
concurrent
i-
in
which
the
leave
could
be
seen
either
as
unpaid
company
leave
or
as
leave
under
the
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
the
statute
didn't
talk
about
that,
there
has
g-
or
it
is
reasonable
for
the
secretary
to
come
up
with
a
rule
that
tells
us
whether
it
counts
against
the
act
or
whether
it
doesn't
in
the
unpaid
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
congress
may
not
have
required
it,
but
at
the
end
of
the
twelve
weeks
there's
still
the
question,
did
this
count
under
the
statute,
or
didn't
it
count
under
the
statute,
and
if
the
statute
is
silent,
it
would
seem
to
be
that
that
would
be
a
a
a
subject
for
s-
the
secretary's
regulation.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
was
the
purpose
of
having
the
special
provisions
with
respect
to
whether
it
counts
as
statutory
or
company
when
the
leave
is
paid?
