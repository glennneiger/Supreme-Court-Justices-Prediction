mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well
well,
first
it's
not
clear
in
many
cases,
and
it's
not
clear
in
this
case,
whether
in
fact
the
leave
that
the
employer
provided
complied
with
all
the
requirements
of
the
act.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
the
thrust
of
the
secretary's
regulation
is
that
it
is
better
to
have
a
bright
line
rule
than
to
require
the
courts
to
engage
in
after
the
fact
speculative
inquiries
regarding
what
might
have
been
done
months
or
years
earlier
if
the
requisite
notice
had
been
given
and
and
this,
to
the
extent
this
is
harsh,
it
is
harsh
in
the
same
way
that
a
statute
of
limitations
is
harsh.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
certainly,
statutory
li-
statutes
of
limitations
by
by
definition
are
imposed
by
the
legislature,
but
there
are
instances,
and
we've
cited
one
in
our
brief,
in
which
an
administrative
agency
that
is
given
authority
to
resolve
complaints
under
an
act
may
be
authorized
to
promulgate
reasonable
procedural
regulations
to
implement
that
directive,
and
that
might
include
the
requirement
that
a
claim
be
filed
within
a
certain
number
of...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
do
you
have
our
our
brief
this
is
on
page
twenty-four
of
our
brief
in
footnote
six.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
first
the
the
regulation
specific-
she
she
was
not
entitled
to
fmla
leave
at
the
time
of
her
first
request,
but
in
fact
the
the
dol
regulations
specifically
require
that
if
an
employee
requests
leave
for
an
fmla-covered
purpose
but
is
not
yet
eligible
for
the
protections
of
the
fmla,
the
employer
is
required
to
notify
the
employee
of
the
time
when
she
will
become
eligible,
and
second,
at
any
rate,
when
the
employee
made
her
first
request
for
extension
of
leave
she
had
passed
the
the
twelve
month
period
and
she
was
eligible
for
the
protections
of
the
act,
and
it's
true
that
in
terms
of
the
sheer
number
of
weeks
of
leave
that
it
was
willing
to
give,
the
company
was
more
generous
than
the
act
required,
but
the
fact
that
an
individual
or
a
business
goes
beyond
the
requirements
of
the
law
in
some
respects
doesn't
excuse
its
noncompliance
with
other
aspects
of
the
law.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
that
that
the
intermittent
leave
is
itself
important,
and
and
again
there
may
be
a
substantial
question
as
to
whether
this
particular
employee
could
have
made
effective
use
of
the
fmla
right
to
intermittent
lead
leave
had
she
known
she
had
it,
and
the
secretary
might,
as
the
eighth
circuit
suggested,
have
adopted
the
regulatory
approach
under
which
that
would
be
the
dispositive
inquiry,
but
instead
the
secretary
has
chosen
to
promulgate
a
bright
line
rule.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
in
this
case
the
statute
not
only
gives
the
agency
general
rulemaking
authority
but
also
provides
that
it
will
be
a
violation
of
the
act
for
an
employer
to
interfere
with
or
restrain
an
employee
in
her
exercise
of
fmla
rights
and
and,
by
its
nature,
that
language
presumes
that
there
will
be
instances
in
which
employer
conduct
is
not
in
terms
prohibited
by
the
act,
but
is
likely
to
have
the
practical
effect
of
dissuading
or
preventing
employees
from
effectively
exercising
their...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
sir-
un-
under
the
the
nlrb,
under
the
nlrbs
approach
to
implementation
of
the
nlra,
the
question
of
whether
employer
conduct
has
interfered
with
or
restrained
the
exercise
of
protected
rights
is
not
resolved
by
asking
whether
particular
employees
were,
in
fact,
deterred
from
engaging
in
protected
conduct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
bu-
the
analogy
to
the
statute
of
limitations
is
really
that,
if
the
statute
of
limitations
has
expired,
we
don't
ask
whether
the
defendant
could
have
done
anything
differently,
or
whether
the
defendant
was
prejudiced
by
the
absence
of
notice
within
the
two
year
period.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
may
i
answer?
mister...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there's
a
separate
provision
in
the
statute
that
makes
eligibility
for
fmla
benefits
contingent
upon
having
worked
twelve
hundred
fifty
hours
in
the
preceding
calendar
year
and,
therefore,
it's
likely
that
an
employee
who
had
worked
only
five
months
and
then
had
been
on
leave
for
seven
months
would
fail
to
satisfy
that
requirement.
