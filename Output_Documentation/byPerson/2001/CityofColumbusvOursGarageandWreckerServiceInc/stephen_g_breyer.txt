there's
a...
there's
a
problem
with
cities
when
you
get
to
safety
regulation
for
trucks.
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
safety
regulation
that
a
city
might
want
to
have
that
wouldn't
have
a
negative
impact
or
some
impact
on
routes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
routes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i
mean,
there's
a
long
history
in
the
icc
of
trying
to
create,
say,
dynamite
truck
routes.
well,
you
can
imagine
what
something
like
that
does
once
you
start
talking
about
it
within
the
city.
and...
and
every
neighborhood
in
sight
says,
send
it
somewhere
else.
so,
it's
not
illogical
that
people
who
are
worried
about
creating
uniformity
of
routes
would
say,
keep
the
cities
out
of
this.
it's...
it's
a
nightmare.
and...
and...
but
i
have
no
reason
to
know
whether
this
is
so
or
not.
and
so
i
ask
you,
is
there
any
kind
of
safety
regulation
that
doesn't
get
into
that
kind
of
routing
nightmare
when
you
talk
about
cities?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
looking
for
specifically--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
most
cities
i've
been
in
had--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
at
the
same
question
that
i
think
everyone
has
asked.
in
my
mind...
and
i
might
be
misremembering...
there
are
lots
of
streets...
there
used
to
be
in
san
francisco
and
you'd
see
a
sign,
and
it
would
say,
no
trucks
over
3-and-a-half
tons.
and
it
seems
to
me
in
boston
i
can
think
of
seeing
signs.
i
thought
maybe
they
said,
no
trucks
over
such
and
such.
maybe
they
just
say
no
vehicle
over
such
and
such.
and
my
impression
is
that
in
many
cities
there
are
many
such
streets,
and
which
streets
there
are
is
a
matter
for
the
municipality
to
decide.
and
it's
a
shifting
pattern,
and
typically
it's
in
residential
areas.
and
there's
lots
of
local
regulation
of
that
kind.
that's
my
impression.
and
i
want
to
know,
on
your
reading
of
this
statute,
does
this
change
when
i'm
thinking
of
those
signs
on
one
street
after
another?
does
that
all
change
because
they're
preempted,
and
now
each
neighborhood
has
to
go
to
sacramento,
if
they're
in
california,
and
convince
the...
the
legislature?
i'd
be
very
surprised
if
that
is
so,
that
congress
changed
so
well
established
a
municipal
pattern
of
behavior
without
saying
anything
about
it.
and
therefore,
i
think
everyone
is
driving
at
the
same
question.
i
understand
about
all
the
licensing
stuff,
but
i
want
to
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
i'm
saying
when
your...
accept
the
fact
that
if
i
accept
your
position
in
this
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--at
the
moment
i'm
thinking
all
this
traditional
regulation
of
what
street
you
can
use
if
you're
a
truck
is
being
wiped
out.
i
mean,
that's
relevant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
motor
carriers
of
property
or
just
motor
carriers?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
if
they...
if
they
don't
say
on
the
street
motor
carriers
of
property
cannot
use
this,
then
it's
not
preempted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
not
a
word
of
legislative
history
i
take
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
the
middle
one?
what
about
the
middle
one?
it
says,
the
authority
of
a
state
to
impose
highway
limitations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
can't
figure
out,
for
the
life
of
me,
how...
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
say
the
state
can
impose
limitations
on
the
use
of
highways,
but
the
city
cannot
impose
limitations
on
the
use
of
streets.
but
your
reading
would
lead
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
same
problem,
you
didn't,
is...
to
me
anyway,
is...
is
(3)(a).
do
you
see
what
i'm
thinking?
i
mean,
the
same
human
being
at
the
same
time
wrote
the
words
in...
in
(c)(2)(a)
and
he
used
the
word
state,
and
at
precisely
the
same
time,
he
wrote
the
second
exception,
which
is
(3)(a)--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
he
put
in
political
subdivision.
and
what
i
cannot
get
over
is
i
don't
see
how
a
single
human
being
on
the
same
day
at
the
same
time
could
write
two
exceptions,
use
the
word
"state"
in
one
and
use
the
word
"political
subdivision"
in
the
other,
without
meaning
a
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
answer.
