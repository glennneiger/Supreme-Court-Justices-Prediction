to
give
us
any
examples
of
municipal
safety

that
are
preempted
by
this
section
as
it's
been
interpreted
below?
justice

as
a
practical
matter?

so,
we're
really
talking
about
licensing
schemes.
is
this
anything
that
the
state
couldn't
undertake
to
do
itself
with
its
state
driver's
license
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cordray,
i
hope
you'll
tell
us
the
practical
effects
of
the
decision
below.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
also
speaks
to
routes
or
weight
limitations.
are
there
situations
where
the
city
or
town
is
particularly
aware
of
traffic
problems
within
the
city
or
a
weak
bridge
or
something
and
that
its
limitations
are
needed?
