mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
in
1994
divested
the
states
of
their
traditional
authority
to
delegate
police
powers
over
local
safety
matters
to
their
political
subdivisions.
it
would
be
no
small
matter
for
congress
to
impose
such
a
restriction
on
the
states,
and
we
submit
they
did
no
such
thing
in
this
instance.
in
making
that
point,
it
may
be
helpful
to
look
at
the
text
of
the
statute,
which
is
reprinted
in
full
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
blue
brief.
and
page
a-2
of
that
appendix
specifically
repeats
the
language
of
(c)(2)(a),
the
operative
provision
at
issue
here.
and
our
first
point,
as
a
matter
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
is
that
congress
specifically
said
that
the
preemption
provision,
quote,
"shall
not
restrict
the
safety
regulatory
authority
of
a
state."
now,
prior
to
1994,
ohio,
the
state
of
ohio,
had
exercised
regulatory
authority
in
this
area
by
delegating
its
power
specifically
over
tow
truck
regulations
to
local
political
subdivisions.
it's
very
difficult
for
us
to
understand
how
the
court
of
appeals
interpretation
does
not
in
fact,
quote,
"restrict
the
safety
regulatory
authority
of
a
state."
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--yes,
your
honor.
and
the
normal
russello
argument
is
that
a
litigant
like
myself
is
trying
to
read
into
another
provision
a
term
that
is
specifically
mentioned
elsewhere
in
the
statute.
here
the
suggestion
is
that
we're
trying
to
read
the
term,
political
subdivision,
into
(c)(2)(a).
that's
not
what
we're
trying
to
do.
what
we're
saying
is
the
traditional
safety
regulatory
authority
of
a
state
was
preserved
by
(c)(2)(a)
and
traditionally
states,
including
ohio,
had
specifically
exercised
that
authority
by
delegating
it
in
some
instances
to
state
executive
branch
agencies
and
in
other
instances,
specifically
here,
to
political
subdivisions.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
actually
it
did,
although
it's...
it's
backwards,
in
the
sense
that
they
generally
regulate
all
motor
carriers
at
the
state
level,
but
they
exempted
tow
trucks,
therefore
allowing
political
subdivisions
like
columbus
to
enact
their
own
tow
truck
ordinances.
so,
in
fact,
in
this
case
it
would
be
specific,
although
i
wouldn't
say
our
argument
rests
on
that
point.
many
states
like
ohio
are
home
rule
states,
which
in
their
constitutions
give
general
grants
to
political
subdivisions
to
have
powers
of
local
self-government.
so,
in
this
case,
i...
i
would
say
it's
a
little
easier
because
there
was
something
specific
as
to
tow
trucks,
but
i
wouldn't
say
that
our
argument
rests
on
that
point.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no.
that
it
includes
the
right
to
delegate
political
subdivisions.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
right.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
we're
not
saying--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--we're
not--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--we're
not
saying
states
are
political
subdivisions.
we're
simply
saying
the
preservation
of
a
state,
deregulatory
authority
of
a
state
includes
the
power
to
delegate.
but
as
to
(c)(2)(c),
keep
in
mind
that
was
a
1995
amendment.
that
was
not
part
of
the
original
legislation.
so,
the
suggestion
would
be
that
congress's--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--style
in
1995
modified
the
1994
act.
and
no
one
is
arguing--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that's...
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
i...
in
o'gilve,
the
court
said
specifically
that
a
later
act
cannot
modify
the
terms
of
an
earlier
act.
but
let
me...
i
think
there's
another
answer
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--right.
well,
your
honor,
the...
the
thing
that
i
think
may
be
helpful
in
thinking
about
(c)(2)(c)
and
the
other
mentions
of
political
subdivision
throughout
14501
is
they're
all
in
the
context
of...
context
of
the
enact
or
enforce
language,
which
is
exactly
how
(c)(1)
reads.
(c)(1)
says
these
political
bodies
may
not
enact
or
enforce
these
particular
laws.
that,
of
course,
is
not
the
way
(c)(2)(a)
or,
for
that
matter,
(a)(2)...
(a)(2)
does
exactly
the
same
thing.
it
preserves
the
safety
regulatory
authority
of
the
state
over
these
various
other
provisions
elsewhere
identified
in
title
49.
when
it
comes
to
(c)(2)(c),
it's
dealing
with
a
topic
specifically
mentioned
in
(c)(1),
prices.
and
it
follows
the
exact
same
structure
of
(c)(1),
not
surprisingly,
because
it's
dealing
with
a
topic
that
is
covered
in
(c)(1).
(c)(2)(a)--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--exactly,
your
honor.
and
there
was
a
division
of
authority,
going
back
to
1966,
where
the
old
icc
had
regulated
all
of
the
economic
issues
over
motor
carriers,
and
the
department
of
transportation
had
regulated
all
the
safety
issues.
and
what
happens
in
1994
is
they're
simply
deregulating.
the
icc
is
deregulating
this
area.
they
wanted
to
make
sure,
as
this
court
said
in
morales,
that
states
wouldn't
undo
that
particular
deregulatory
effort.
but
at
the
same
time,
as
(c)(2)(a)
and
(a)(2)
makes
clear,
they
wanted
to
preserve
the
provisions
of
a
separate
part
of
title
49
dealing
with
safety
issues,
something
that
dot,
a
separate
agency,
had
always
regulated.
and
i
hope,
justice
scalia,
this
will
help
in
getting
to
your...
your
point.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely.
and...
and
if...
if
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
reverse,
it
would
certainly
be
within
the
rights
of
respondents
to
go
back
to
the
sixth
circuit
and
say,
as
to
some
of
these
provisions
of
the
columbus
code,
they
are
not
in
fact
safety
ordinances
or
safety
provisions,
and
therefore
they
could
be
regulated
as
a
price,
route,
or
service.
but
there's
another,
i
think,
important
point
that
responds
to
this
issue
of
the
mention
of
political
subdivisions
elsewhere
in
14501.
i
think
there
is
general
agreement
in
the
case
that
as
to
(c)(2)(a),
all
of
the
other
words,
every
single
other
word
in
(c)(2)(a)
including,
for
example,
the
definition
of
the
term
safety,
is
defined
not
from
1994
on
by
looking
at
the
difference
of...
between
safety
and
price,
routes,
or
services
mentioned
in
(c)(1)...
in
other
words,
you
would
not
define
safety
after
1994
based
on
its
contextual
comparison
to
prices--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
it's
on
a-2
of
our
appendix,
and
it's...
it's
labeled
motor
carriers
of
property.
excuse
me.
i
should
have
made
that
more
clear.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
these
other
terms
in
(c)(2)(a)
i
think
all
would
agree
would
be
defined
by
other
provisions
in
title
49.
for
example,
the
word
safety
would
be
defined
by
the
provisions
in
chapter
311
of
title
49,
which
is
a
large...
a
large
section
of
the
code
dealing
with
safety
provisions.
it
would
not
be
within
the
states'
rights
after
1994
to
suddenly
start
reinventing
new
definitions
of
safety,
new
definitions
of
hazardous
materials
routing
restrictions
or
size
and
weight
routing
restrictions.
we
would
be
stuck
with
all
of
those
definitions,
including
notably
those
preemption
provisions.
we
think
it
would
be
a
rather
odd
interpretation
of
(c)(2)(a)
to
say
that,
yes,
you
determine
the
meaning
of
all
of
these
preserved
matters
by
reference
to
other
parts
of
title
49,
but
you
do
not
do
so
when
it
comes
to
what
the
meaning
of
safety
regulatory
authority
of
a
state
is.
and
when
you
look
at
those
other
provisions
of
title
49,
it's
quite
clear
that
congress
contemplated
in
all
of
them...
routing
restrictions,
safety...
that
states
could
delegate
their
power
to
local
subdivisions.
that's
not
only
in
some
of
the
statutory
provisions,
but
it's
in
the
regulations.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
not
our
argument,
your
honor.
we're
not
saying
a
state--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--we're
not
saying--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i...
i
disagree,
your
honor.
we're
not
saying
that...
congress...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
congress
has
no
right
to
empower
a
city.
congress
can't
create
a
city.
they
can't
give
it
a
power.
that's
a
power
the
states
have.
it
made
perfect
sense
in
(c)(2)(a)
to
preserve
the
safety
regulatory
authority
of
a
state
because
it's
the
state
legislature's
job
to
determine
what
other
political
bodies,
if
any,
regulate
in
that
area.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
that
we
think--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
your
honor,
that
would
strike
me
as
an
extraordinary
hoop
for
congress
to
ask
the
states
to
step
through.
we're
not
aware
of
a
single
statute
that
this
court
has
ever
construed
to
mean
that
state
legislatures
alone,
but
not
their
political
subdivisions,
can
regulate
a
particular
area.
i'm
not
aware
of
a
single
statute
where
that's
ever
happened.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
right.
excuse
me?
the
last
word?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
right.
the...
and
i
think
the
respondents'
point
is
or
suggestion
is
that
it
would
be
quite
natural
for
congress
to
say,
as
to
routing
restrictions,
we
want
uniform
laws.
we
want
them
to
be
the
same
throughout
the
state,
and
we
don't
want
to
bother
with
municipalities
establishing
different
regulations
for
a
routing
restriction.
well,
the...
the
whole
point
of
a
routing
restriction
is
to
account
for
differences
within
the
topography
or
geography
of
the
states.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
hazardous...
i...
i
don't
think
the
general
rule
has
been
that
either
the
federal
government
or
the
states
have
been
concerned
about
heavily
populated
regions
deciding,
for
example,
to
route
hazardous
materials
around
their
beltway
as
opposed
to
through
the
middle.
everyone
thinks
that's
a
good
idea,
and
the
cities
generally,
including
columbus,
have
been
left
in
control
of
that
kind
of
decision,
which
is
something
obviously
one
doesn't
need
to
worry
about--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--in
a
size
and
weight
situation,
of
course,
you're
going
to
situations
where
bridges
or
particular
roads
in,
you
know,
densely
populated
areas
require
different
rules
than
in
rural
regions
of
a
state
where,
for
example,
the
roads
are
bigger
and
even
if
they're
not
bigger,
they're
not
as
near
to
either
businesses
or
heavily
populated
areas.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
could...
could
a...
a...
the
question,
first
of
all,
would
be
whether
that
relates
to
interstate
commerce,
and
if
it
relates
to
interstate
commerce...
that
is,
commerce
between
states...
then
the
department
of
transportation
is...
is
going
to
very
heavily
regulate
that
particular
route
restriction
and...
and
has
authority
to
preempt
it,
even
as
a
matter
of
regulation.
if
it's
purely
intrastate,
traditionally
that's
been
something
that
congress
or
the
agencies
hardly
regulated
at
all,
and
to
the
extent
they
regulated
them,
it
was
only
when
there
was
federal
funding.
but
for
the
most
part,
the
regime
has
been
that
a
locality
makes
that
decision
through
a
delegation
of
power
from
their
state
legislature.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
it
is,
your
honor,
but
title
49...
i
think
it's
31147...
specifically
says
that
traffic
laws...
i
think
a
speeding
limit
would
fall
under
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--is
something
that
the
department
of
transportation
does
not
regulate
and
neither
does
congress,
which
to
me
is
one
more
indicator
that
you
don't,
after
1994,
start
having
free-form
debates
about
what
safety
means.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
on
what
ground?
i
mean,
it
would
have
to
be
a
price,
route,
or
service
for
there
to
be
preemption.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
as...
i
see
what
you're
saying.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
right.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
i
think
the
position
they
would
take...
and
maybe
they
could
clarify
this...
is
that
if
it's
not
a
price,
route,
or
service,
you
ignore
(c)(2)(a),
and
you
simply
go
to
the
rest
of
title
49.
but
i'm
not...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
if
i
could
make
one
more
point,
justice
scalia,
and
i
hope
this
responds
somewhat
to
the
point
you
raised
earlier.
state
laws,
even
if
you
think
of
them
as
state
legislative
acts,
are
being
preempted
in
this
case.
let's
ignore
the
state
of
ohio.
new
york.
the
state
of
new
york
says
as
to
populations
with
more
than
1
million
people,
the
cities
in...
those
populations
can
enact
tow
truck
ordinances.
this
interpretation
that
the
court
of
appeals
embraced
preempts
that
state
law.
there's
no...
strictly
speaking,
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
city
law
divorced
from
a
state
law.
the
city
power
comes
from
the
states
and
there's
just
no
such
thing.
and
we
think,
as
the
lack
of
parallelism
between
(c)(1)
and
(c)(2)
indicates,
all
they
were
doing
was
preserving
that
traditional
safety
regulatory
authority
of
a
state.
if
i
could
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
i'd
appreciate
it.
thank
you.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i'd
like
to
respond
to
a
few
of
the
points--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
your
honor,
not
in...
in
the
insurance
area.
but
there's
a...
i
think
a
better
answer
to
that
concern,
and
the
better
answer
is,
our
point
is
that
(c)(2)(a)
incorporates
all
of
these
preexisting
preemption
provisions.
they
are
preemption
provisions
in
other
parts
of
title
49,
whether
it's
insurance,
safety,
size
and
weight
routing,
or
hazardous
material
routing.
so,
the
problem
with
justice
o'connor's
point
of
practical
consequences...
in
reversing
the
sixth
circuit,
there
is
no
gap
here.
why?
because
for
60
years,
congress
and
the
department
of
transportation
have
been
regulating
these
very
areas,
both
with
respect
to
state
laws
and
city
laws,
to
the
extent
they've
been
enacted.
so,
the
multiplicity
of
insurance
regulations
is
a
false
concern.
i
mean,
the...
congress
has
already
indicated
in
31138
and
39
what
the
rules
are
there.
the
department
of
transportation
has
implemented
regulations
that
do
get
chevron
deference,
and
they
lay
out
what
the
rules
are.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
right.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
right.
your
honor,
look...
compare
(3)(a)
to
(c)(1).
they
follow
the
exact
same
enact
or
enforce
language.
(c)(2)(a)
does
not
use
the
enact
or
enforce
language.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
the
answer,
number
one.
number
two,
remember,
(c)(3)
is
for
the
benefit
of
motor
carriers.
they
want
to
make
sure
they
could
have
these
rules,
whether
city
or
state,
apply
to
them
on
a
city-by-city
not
state-by-state
basis.
now,
the...
the
regulatory
purpose,
your
honor...
the
landmark
legislation
in
this
area
was
the
1980
law
that
deregulated
interstate
commerce.
everyone
agrees
that
did
not
divest
cities
of
authority.
the
1994
law
at
issue
here
was
about
intrastate
commerce,
primarily
to
put
fedex
and
ups
on
a
level
playing
field,
and
suddenly
respondents
are
saying
that
deregulated...
regulatory
purpose
required
the
divestment
of
local
authority?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
it's
at
its
outer
edges,
and
that
to
me
is
what
is
so
odd
about
this
particular
interpretation.
they're
saying
in
the
intrastate
area,
you
could
divest
states
of
their
authority
to
delegate,
but
they've
not
done
it
in
the
interstate
area?
i
mean,
how
absurd
is
that?
it's...
it's
got
it
exactly
backwards.
now,
the
practical
consequences...
i
want
to
go
back
to
again...
of
their
interpretation.
(c)(2)(a),
they've
agreed,
has
to
be
construed
the
same
way
throughout,
and
there
are
countless...
as
we
indicated
in
our
opening
brief,
every
state
in
the
country
has
delegations
to
cities
that
have
size
and
weight
controls,
size
and
weight
rules
that
would
be
eliminated
by
this
particular
construction.
thank
you.
