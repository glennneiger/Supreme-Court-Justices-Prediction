so...
so,
if
a
state
were
to
say
all
prices
of
all
trucks
in
this
state
have
to
be
$50...
all
trucks...
and
they
don't
say
motor
carriers
of
property,
that's
not
preempted.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
it's
not
correct.
and
similarly,
if
they
say
on
a
street,
no
truck
can
use
this
street--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
they
don't
say
motor
carriers
of
property,
it's
the
same.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
found
not
a
word...
am
i
right?
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
history
of
this...
although
there
was
some
human
being
who
wrote
these
words,
there
is
not
a
word
in
any
document,
hearing,
report,
debate
that
casts
any
light
on
this
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no.
i'm
just
trying
to...
it's
mysterious
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i'm
having
trouble,
and
therefore
i...
i
just
sometimes
look
at
the
legislative
history--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
try
to
figure
it
out.
and
you
haven't
found
anything,
nor
does
the
other--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
sutton,
could
you
ask
one...
answer
one
factual
question
for
me?
your...
your
brother
made
the
argument
that
in...
in
reading
(c)(2)(a),
he
went
to
the
last
clause
and
said
on
your
theory
every
political
subdivision
could
enact
its
own
financial
responsibility
and
insurance
laws
and
so
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
would
be
a
crazy
scheme.
my...
my
question
is,
is
there
in
fact
any
history
of
municipalities
enacting
these
kinds
of
statutes
so
that
it's
something
that
might
have
been
in
congress's
mind?
