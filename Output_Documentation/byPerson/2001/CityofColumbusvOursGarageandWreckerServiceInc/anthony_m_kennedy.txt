would
your
argument
be
the
same
if
the
state
had
not
made
a
specific
delegation?
did
it
make
a
specific
delegation
with
respect
to
tow
trucks?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
that
connection,
i
was
going
to
ask
could
this...
suppose
that
you
do
not
prevail
in
this
case
and
we
accept
the
respondents'
interpretation.
could
the
state
then
every
year
have
a
cleanup
statute
in
which
it
says
the
state
hereby
adopts...
or
authorizes
cities
that
are
no
less
than
x
number
of
persons,
no
greater
than
y
number
of
persons,
obviously
referring
to
the
city
of
columbus,
that...
that
the
state
then
allows
specifically
columbus
to
regulate,
that
it
have
an
ordinance
and
it
just
tracks
the
whole
ordinance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
then
we're
not
arguing
about
very
much
in
your
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
there
been
any...
what's
the
closest
case
respondents
could
cite
to
show
a
contrary
practice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
from
this
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
if
a
city
says
no
trucks
through
the
park
with
the
public
playground
between
certain
hours,
that
has
to
be
the...
the
state?
that's
the
only
one
that
could
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
what
about
the...
the
answer
that
you
gave
earlier
to
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
and
i
had?
no...
no
trucks
through
the
playground
or...
or
through
a
residential
neighborhood
at
a
certain
time.
i
thought
you
said
that
would
be
preempted,
but
now
you're
saying
it
applies
only
if
they're
motor
carriers
of
property?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
you're...
you're
asking...
you're
asking
us
to...
to
have
a
very
careful
grammatically
correct
reading
of
the
act,
and
in
your
answer
that...
that
you've
just
given
to
justice
scalia,
transportation
of
property
is
preceded
by
an
or.
it
seems
to
me
the
first
clause
is
quite
independent,
related
to
a
price,
route,
or
service
of
any
motor
carrier.
that's
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
i'm
not
sure
the
qualification
you
urge
on
us,
in
order
to
mitigate
the
effects
of
this
holding
works.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
think
this
statute
is...
that
there
are
arguments
either
way
for
interpreting
it,
shouldn't
we
pay
heed
to
the
petitioners'
point
that
it's
a
very
serious
matter
for
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
tell
states
how
they
should
govern
themselves?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's...
let's
say
we...
we
disagree
with
that.
is...
is
that
not...
let's
say
we
find
the
statute
in...
in
equipoise,
or
the
arguments.
should
we
not
give
force
to
the
argument
petitioner
makes
that
the
states
should
be
presumed
to
have
the
authority
to
determine
how
best
to
govern
themselves?
