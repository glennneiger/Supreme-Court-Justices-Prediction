justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sutton,
would...
would
you
look
a
little
further
down
in,
in
the
provision
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
your
brief?
look
on
page
a-3.
you
were
reading
from
(c)(2)(a)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
which
it
says,
shall
not
restrict
the
safety
regulatory
authority
of
a
state.
and
you
say
that
includes,
you
know,
political
subdivisions
of
a
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
okay.
just
read
two...
two
lines
later,
(2)(c)
where
it
says,
does
not
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
again,
it
uses
the
same...
shall
not
restrict,
does
not
apply
to
the
authority
of
a
state,
or
a
political
subdivision
of
a
state,
to
enact
or
enforce
a
law,
regulation,
or
other
provision.
why
in
that
provision
does
it
say
does
not
apply
to
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision?
because
you're
telling
us,
when
you
say
state,
it
includes
whatever
authority
the
state
has
to
delegate
to
a
political
subdivision.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
wouldn't
have
needed
that
language
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
we
always
look
at
an
act
in
toto
and...
and
don't
try
to
piece
it
apart
as
to
what
was
enacted
when.
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
make
sense
of
this
statute
as
a
whole.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
modify
it,
but
it...
it
can
give
clear
indication
of
what...
of
what
it
meant.
i
mean,
you're
assuming
that
it
modifies
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it's
not
defined.
it
doesn't...
there's
not
a
definition
that
says,
state
includes
political
subdivision
of
a
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
it's
not
your
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
a
stronger
argument
if
that
were
your
argument.
that...
that's
my
point.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
understand
all
that,
of
course.
and...
and
in
isolation,
that
phrase
most
naturally
would...
would
mean
safety
regulatory
authority
of
a
state,
including,
of
course,
its
ability
to
delegate
it
to
municipalities.
but
what
is
sticking
in
our
craw
is
the
fact
that
elsewhere
in
the
statute,
the
language
is
very
careful
to
distinguish
between
the
authority
of
a
state,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the...
and
the
separate
authority
of
political
subdivisions
of
the
state.
now,
what...
what
is
your
explanation
for
those
other
separations?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
are
many
federal
statutes
that...
that
make
grants
to
municipalities
for
various
functions
and
don't
make
it
to
the
state.
this
is
a...
certainly
the
federal
government
interfering
in
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
its
municipalities.
and
the
state
has
no...
no
ability
to
veto
whether
the
municipality
is
going
to
accept
those
funds
or
not.
and
there's...
there's
been
a
lot
of
controversy
within
the
states
between
the
municipalities
and
the
state
government
as
to...
as
to
what
money
should
be
accepted
and
so
forth.
it
seems
to
me
that
has
exactly
the
same
effect
as
what
you're
talking
about
here.
the
federal
government
has,
indeed,
indeed,
intervened
in
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
its...
and
its
political
subdivisions.
justice
antonin
scalia
who...
who
administers
this
statute?
is
there
a
federal
agency
that...
that
can
be
said
to
be
administering
this...
this
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cordray,
on
this
point,
look
at
on
page
a-2,
(c)(1),
the
general
rule.
it
has
at
the
very
end
of
it
the
phrase,
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
reading
on
page
a-2,
(c)(1),
the
general
rule
from
which
(c)(2)
is...
is
an
exception.
and
the
general
rule
is,
except
as
provided,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
no
state,
political
subdivision
shall
enact
any
provision
having
the
force
and
effect
of
law
related
to
a
price,
route,
or
service
of
any
motor
carrier.
and
then
there's
a
lot
of
other
language.
and
then
at
the
very
end,
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of
property.
does
that
phrase
at
the
end
go
all
the
way
back
to
related
to
a
price,
route,
or
service
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
would
make
it
a
very
narrow
provision
then,
wouldn't
it,
that...
that
we're
excluding
the...
the
municipalities
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
just
couldn't
say
you're
not
allowed
to
use
this
street
to
carry...
to
carry
moving
goods
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
what
it
would
go
to
if
it
didn't
go
to
that.
it
can't
go
to
the
stuff
after
the
or.
or
any
motor...
motor
private
carrier,
broker
or
freight
forwarder
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of...
what
is
a...
what
is
a
motor
private
carrier
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of...
of
property?
it
has
no
meaning
unless
you
read
it
all
the
way
back
up
to
price,
route,
or
service
with
respect
to
the
transportation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
the
best
statute,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
the
best
statute.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
their...
their
answer
is
that...
that
when
you
speak
of
the
regulatory
authority
of
a
state,
that
naturally
connotes
the
authority
to...
to
delegate
that
to...
to
municipalities.
but
when
you
speak
of
the
authority
of
a
state
to
enact
or
enforce
a
law,
that...
that
much
less
naturally
includes
the
authority
of
a
municipality
to
enact
or
enforce
a
law
so
that...
and
all
of
those
other
references
are
in
connection
with
that
phrase,
to
enact
or
enforce
a
law.
are
they
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
wait.
i...
i
missed
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
where?
what...
what
section
are
you
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
get
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
authority
of
a
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
very
end
of
that
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
(2)(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
part
of
your
argument
was
also
that
streets
are
not
highways,
and
i'm
surprised
you
didn't
make
that
point
when
we
were
talking
about
the...
you
know,
no
trucks
on
a
school
street
or
something
like
that.
isn't
the
term
highways
arguably
different
from...
from
local
residential
neighborhood
streets?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
guess
we'll
have
to
use
the
statute.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cordray,
what...
what
about
the
point
made
that
if...
if
you
accept
your
interpretation,
municipalities
not
only
would
not
be
able
to
enact
regulations
themselves,
they
would
not
be
able
to
enforce
regulations
adopted
by
the...
by
the
state,
which
would
be
a
great
inconvenience,
that
the
only
enforcement
can
be
by
the
state
police
and
not
by
local...
local
police.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
support
is
the
context
of
the
statute,
which--
