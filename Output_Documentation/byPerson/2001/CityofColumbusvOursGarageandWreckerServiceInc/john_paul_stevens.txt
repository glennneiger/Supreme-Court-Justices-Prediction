mr.
sutton,
can
i
ask
you,
do
you
regard...
just
assume
the...
assume
the
other
side
is
right
on
their
interpretation.
would
that
mean
that
a
city
could
not
fix
speed
limits
in
neighborhoods?
speed
limit
is
a
safety
regulation,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
a
traffic
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
if
the...
if
it's
not
federally
regulated,
would
there,
nevertheless,
not
be
preemption
under
their
interpretation
of
this
provision
of
speed
limit
rules?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i
mean,
if...
if
you
read
the
(c)(2)(a)--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as...
as
saying
only
states
are...
can...
are...
preserve
the
right
to...
to
regulate
safety--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
seems
to
me
that
would
preempt
a
local
government's
right
to
fix
a
15-mile
limit
in
a
school
zone.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stewart,
before
your
time
goes
out,
will
you
give
us
your
third
point
too?
you
gave
us
the
first
two.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
on
the
division
of
responsibility?
is
it
your
view...
your
understanding
that
the
cities
would
not
be
able
in
their
licensing
scheme
to
regulate
the
rates
that
the
truckers
charge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
similar
question?
supposing
that
there's
a
heavy
rain
storm
in
a
city
or
something
and
it
becomes
unsafe
to
use
a
certain
street
if
the
truck
is
over
a
certain
size.
could...
the
police
would
not
be
permitted
to
divert
the
traffic
around
that
particular
flooded
area,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
this
is
for
safety
reasons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
figure
it's...
it's
dangerous
because
the
thing
is
too
deep
and
the
trucks
have
to
over-set...
overturn
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
preempted,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing...
truck
size
traffic,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
i
don't
think
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you
read
(c)(1)
as
narrowly
as
you're
suggesting,
you
don't
even
need
the
exemption
because
it
only
relates
to
law,
regulation,
or
other
provision
related
to
price,
route,
or
service.
so...
and
it
doesn't
even
reach
safety.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
(c)(1)
uses
may
enact
or
enforce
just
as...
as
(c)(2)(c)
does,
whereas
(c)(2)(a)
does
not.
the
to
enact
or
enforce
language
applies
in
every
subsection
except
the
one
that
we're
arguing
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if...
but
if
you
didn't
add
the
political
subdivision
in
those
states
and
if
you
had
a
home
rule
state,
then
a
local
government
could...
would
not
be
affected
by
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
described
the
regulatory...
regulatory
authority
in
gross
as
you
do
in
(2)(a),
then
it
would
apply
to
the
authority
to
delegate.
but
when
you're
talking
about
authority
to
enact
or
enforce,
then
you
have
to
identify
the
entities
that
do
the
enacting
and
the
enforcing.
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
perfectly
logical
distinction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
don't
you
agree
that
if
you
didn't
have
all
the
other
subdivisions
in
here,
that
would
be
the
normal
reading
of
regulatory
authority,
which
would
include
the
authority
to
delegate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
one...
but
in
one
provision,
they
say
regulatory
authority,
which
has
a
plain
meaning
that
you'd
be...
brings
a
result
you
disagree
with.
in
the
other
they
consistently
use
authority
of
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision
to
enact
or
enforce.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
don't
refer
to
political
subdivision,
it
just
wouldn't
include
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
it
says
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision
may
not
enact
or
enforce.
that's
the
language
of
the
preemption
clause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
too
fast
for
me.
where
is
the
insurance
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
in...
in
(2)(a),
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
boils
down
to
the
point
that
there
are
10
provisions
in
the
statute.
nine
of
them
are
perfectly
clear.
the
tenth
says
the
same
thing,
but
we're
not
going
to
read
it
the
way
it
seems
to
read
because
it's
not
as
clear
as
the
other
nine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
about
all
it
amounts
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the...
in
the
nine,
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
just
read
the
one
all
by
itself,
it's
perfectly
clear
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
only
reason--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
only
support
you
have
is
they're
not
as
detailed
and
specific
in
the
one
in
question
as
they
are
in
the
other
nine.
