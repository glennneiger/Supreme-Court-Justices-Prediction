mr.
richard
a.
cordray
the
practical
effect
of
the
decision
below,
as
you
uncovered
it
in
your
questioning
earlier,
is
that
federal
law
preempts
municipalities
and
other
local
governments
from
imposing
their
own
individual
licensing
schemes
upon
motor
carriers
of
property
and
that
is--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--size
and
weight
limitations,
as
the
other
matters
addressed
in
(c)(2)(a),
would
be
regulated
at
the
state
level,
not
at
the
local
level
under
the
proper
reading
of
this
statute.
and
the
reason
is
that
congress
did
not
want
to
open
up
the
trucking
industry,
where
it
was
attempting
to
do
something
new,
which
is
deregulate
it
nationwide
and
create
an
unfettered
free
market
for
trucking
and
transportation
services.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that
could
be
done
at
the
state
level
and
it
could
be
done
either
by
going
to
the
state
legislature,
as
you
suggested,
or
it
could
be
done
by
setting
up
a
very
simple
administrative
scheme
at
the
state
level
where
you
would
go
to
the
state
department--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--specifically
because
they
were
trying
to
deregulate
this
market
nationwide.
to
leave
in
place
every
municipality
with
the
option
to
license
different
motor
carriers
of
property
is
not
only--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--again,
i
think
that
petitioners
agree
and
all
the
courts
have
agreed
that
every
subsection
of
(c)(2)(a)
has
to
be
read
together,
and
to
the
extent
municipal
authority
is
being
preempted
in
one
respect,
it's
being
preempted
in
all.
and
the
reason
is
that
congress
was
recognizing
that
schemes
directed
specifically
to
motor
carriers
of
property
at
the
local
level
simply
incorporated
too
much
regulation
that
would
interfere
with
and
impede
a
free
market
for
transportation
services
and
motor
carriers--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--certainly
they
could.
this
goes
to
your
question
you
asked
earlier
which
is
whether
traffic
laws,
ordinary,
general
traffic
laws,
would
be
preempted
under
our--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--statute--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--they...
they
would
be...
they
would
be
diverting--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--they
would
be...
no.
they
would
be
diverting
presumably
all
traffic
that's
heavy
enough
to
create
a
safety
problem.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yes,
but...
but
it's
not
directed
simply
to
motor
carriers
of
property.
it's
directed
to
all
trucks,
all
oversize
vehicles.
it
could
be
private
vehicles,
rvs
that
people
use
to
take
vacations,
whatever
it
might
be.
that
would
be
permissible.
and
traffic
laws,
i
want
to
stress,
are
not
preempted
by
this
statute.
this
statute
is
not
limitless.
as
this
court
has--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--let
me
step
back.
if
the
ordinance
related
to
all
oversize
vehicles...
that
would
be
a
general
traffic
regulation...
that
would
be
permissible.
and
i'll...
and
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
moment,
why
traffic
laws
are
not
preempted
by
the
statute.
they...
they
are
not
related
to
price,
route,
or
service
of
motor
carriers
of
property.
if
it
was
directed
specifically
to
a
type
of
motor
carrier
of
property,
as
this
licensing
scheme
is...
it
applies
directly,
specifically,
and
only
to
tow
trucks...
that
would
be
a
different
matter.
municipalities
are
not
permitted
to
do
that,
and
congress
specifically
wanted
to
do
that
because
although
there
was
a
tradition
of
lots
of
regulation
at
the
state
and
local
level,
congress
was
making
a
policy
decision,
as
it's
free
to
do,
to
say
that
all
of
that
is
impeding
a
free
market
for
transportation
services
and
motor
carriers
that's
affecting
broad
segments
of
the
american
economy.
we
want
to
bring
down
costs,
rid
us
of
these
inefficiencies--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--all
right.
again,
it's
not
what's
specifically
at
issue
in
this
case,
but
i
understand
the
court
wants
the
answer
to
the
hypothetical.
absolutely.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
it
could
be
dealt
with
either
of
two
ways,
your
honor.
either
it
could
be
regarded
as
a
general
traffic
law,
like
a
one-way
street,
like
a
speed
limit,
and
the
like,
in
which
case
we
believe
that
it
would
not
come
within
the
preemption
clause
ex
ante
because
it
has
to
have
a
connection
with
or
reference
to
motor
carriers
of
property
to
come
within
the
terms
of
this
preemption
clause--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--motor
carriers
of
property
which
is
what--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--then
it
is
a
general
traffic
regulation
no
different
from
where
the
speed
limit
says
55
miles
per
hour
and
trucks
have
to
obey
it,
just
as
cars
do.
and
motor
carriers--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--well,
it
would
be
those
who
come
within
the
terms
of
this
specific
preemption
clause.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yes.
i...
i
believe
that
this
statute
is
referring
to
for
hire
carriers
of...
motor
carriers
of
property.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
no,
that
is
not
correct
because
it's
specifically
referenced--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--yes.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
the
reason
is...
no.
the
reason
is
that
specifically
references
price.
there
are
lots
of
laws
that
in...
tangentially
will
affect
routes.
all
right?
a
one-way
street
law,
for
example,
has
to
be
obeyed
by
trucks,
just
as
it
is
by
cars.
that's
not
within
this
preemption
clause.
so,
that's
one
way
to
address
it.
all
right.
and...
and
that
would
be
true
of
all
general
traffic
laws,
just
as
it's
true
of
all
general
tort
laws,
general
tax
laws.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
right.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor,
and
it's
just...
it's
just--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
believe
it
is.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
this
is
a
key
point.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
with--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--and
the
title
of
the
provision
is
motor
carriers
of
property.
that's
specifically
what
they're
dealing
with,
as
distinguished
from
motor
carriers
of
passengers,
which
are
addressed
earlier
in
the
same
section
of
the
statute,
14501(a).
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
it's...
it's
clear
enough
with
respect
to
the
things
we
care
about
here,
which
is
that--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--congress
very
carefully
attempted
to
distinguish
between
a
state
and
a
political
subdivision
of
a
state.
and
it
did
so
repeatedly
in
the
statute
for
the
specific
purpose
of
drawing
a
distinction
between
them.
and
the
only
way--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--no,
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
and
this
case
is
a
good
example
of
it.
they
are
attempting
to
impose
a
licensing
scheme
with
respect
to
tow
trucks
and
could
do
it
with
respect
to
any
motor
carrier
of
property,
parcel
delivery
service,
or
the
like.
and
their...
their
rationale
for
doing
so
apparently
is
safety.
but
in
fact,
that
is
exactly
what
is
preempted
by
this
statute
and
by
this
clause.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
it
would.
if
the
state
is
doing
the
regulating
or
enacting
the
law,
under
this
statute,
the
way
it
reads
and
the...
the
way
it
was
designed,
that
would
be
permissible,
even
if
it's
nonuniform.
if
we
wanted
to
make
it
uniform,
we'd
have
to
go
to
the
legislature
and
try
to
get
that
package
amended
or
go
perhaps
to
the
state
department
of
transportation
which
also
could
do
this
through
an
administrative
scheme.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
no.
it's
not
simply
a
matter
of
form
because
congress
made
a
judgment
that
if
there
were
50
different
states
imposing
their
own
schemes,
that
would
be
less
impediments
and...
and
tangle
of
restrictions
impeding
a
free
market
than
if
39,000
municipalities
and
local
governments
around
the
country
were
free
on
their
own
to
do
what
they
wished,
and
that
that...
that
was
in
fact
very
much
undercutting
the
desire
to
get
to
a
free
market
in
transportation
services.
but
i
also
want
to
go
back
to
your
comment
and
your
question
earlier.
this
statute
does
not
itself
distinguish
between
economic
regulation
that's
preempted
on
the
one
hand
and
safety
regulation
that's
not
on
the
other.
the
phrasing
of
the
statute
is
much
broader.
it
is
related
to
price,
route,
and
services
of
a
motor
carrier
of
property.
that
may
not
only
be
economic
regulation.
and
so
the
notion
that
that's
the
divide
and
we
can
simply
remand,
the
lower
court
can
sort
it
out,
i
believe
is
not
correct.
now,
as
we've
seen
here,
the
fact
that
the...
the
statute
is
broad
does
not
mean
it's
all
encompassing.
i
mean,
i
could
see
an
argument
that
truck...
trucking
companies
no
longer
now
have
to
pay
corporate
tax
because
that
affects
their
price.
but
that's
a
general
provision.
as
this
court
has
said
in
construing
erisa
and
needs
to
be
imported
here
in
the
dillingham
case
and
the
like,
there
has
to
be
a
connection
with
or
reference
to
the
specific
item
at
issue.
here
motor
carriers
of
property.
and
that's
what
we
have
with
this
licensing
scheme
here
which
is
directed
specifically
at
tow
trucks
and
will
have
a
very
direct
relation
and...
and
effect
on
their
prices
and
services.
i
also
want
to
mention
the
problem
of
surplusage
because
it's
not
been
mentioned
on
the
other
side,
and
it's
very
important
here.
what
possible
reason
would
congress
have
had
for
including
in
the
statute
what
obviously
is
a
key
phrase?
it
shows
up
seven
times
in
the
course
of
the
single
statute.
political
subdivision
of
a
state.
why
would
that
be
included
at
all
if
the
authority
of
a
state
is
to
be
read,
as
petitioners
would
have
it,
to
always
include
within
it
the
authority
of
a
political
subdivision.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
two
reasons
why
that
does
not
work,
your
honor.
they
agreed
that
the
subsections
of
(c)(2)(a)
have
to
be
read
in
parallel
and
the
second
one
with
respect
to
size
and
weight
and
the
like.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
regulatory
authority.
it
just
says
authority
of
a
state.
second,
in
the
preemption
clause
itself--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--well,
regulatory
authority
is
the
phrase
used
in
the
first
subclause--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--of
(c)(2)(a)
related
to
safety.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
but
they're
not
talking
about
authority
to
regulate.
they're
just
talking
about
authority
of
a
state
with
respect
to
the
size
and
weight,
hazardous
cargo,
and
then
with
respect
to
insurance.
and
insurance
is
an
excellent
example
i'll
get
to
in
a
moment.
but
also
in
the
preemption
clause
itself,
(c)(1),
it
refers
to
the
authority
of
a
state
to
enact
or
enforce
a
law
or
regulation.
that
is
regulatory
authority,
and
it
distinguishes
it
full
stop
from
the
authority
of
a
political
subdivision
of
a
state
to
do
the
same
thing.
what?
enact
or
enforce
a
regulation.
so,
the
regulatory
authority
is
being
discussed
specifically
in
the
preemption
clause
itself.
that's
the
fallacy
of
starting
the
analysis
here
by
jumping
all
the
way
to
(c)(2)(a)
and
wrenching
that
text
out
of
context
and
divorcing
it
from
the
preemption
clause
that
it's
meant
to
be
a
savings
subordinate
to.
but
the
preemption
clause
itself--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--that's
correct,
which
is
a
telling
point.
in
every
subsection,
congress
went
out
of
its
way
to
add
political
subdivision
of
a
state.
i've
still
not
heard
a
single
sensible
explanation
for
why
they
would
bother
to
do
that.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
no,
not
correct
because
their
notion
is
that
state
includes
delegating
to
its
local
government
as
a
delegated
power
from
the
state.
they
want
to
read
the
two
as
being
encompassed
within
one
another.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
well,
i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
and
again,
there's
nothing
about
regulatory
authority
that
is
unique
in
this
statute
because
(c)(2)(a)
does
refer
to
regulatory
authority
with
respect
to
safety,
but
it
doesn't
refer
to
regulatory
authority
with
respect--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
would
agree
that
if
(c)(2)(a)
alone
were
the
statute--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--that
would
be
a
sensible
reading.
but
if
you...
that...
that's
taking
it
out
of
a
context
where
congress
specifically
is
dealing
with
a
state
and
a
political
subdivision
regularly
in
the
statute
and
then
in
one
instance
a
special
kind--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--but
it
doesn't--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--it
doesn't
have
a
plain
meaning.
it
doesn't
really
have
any
meaning
because
in
the
preemption
clause
itself,
they're
referring
to
the
authority
of
a
state
to
regulate,
and
they're
separately
referring
to
the
authority
of--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--correct.
that's
right.
enact
or
enforce
what?
a
regulation,
which
is
the
same
thing
as
to
regulate.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that
was
my
point.
i
was
trying
to
make
it
earlier.
i...
i
didn't
make
it
as
clearly
as
you
just
did.
but
that's
exactly--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--well,
that's
exactly
right.
trying
to
give
some
special
meaning--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--we're
talking
about
(c)(2)(a).
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
this
is
a
point
i
tried
to
make
earlier
and
i
did
not
make
it
as
clearly
as
the
chief
justice
just
did.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
but
they're
attempting
to
give
some
special
meaning
to
the
phrase
safety
regulatory
authority,
but
by
their
own
argument,
that
can't
follow
because
they
want
to...
they
have
to
read
all
these
provisions
the
same
way.
and
the
second
subclause
there
refers--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--to
the
authority
of
a
state,
nothing
about
safety,
nothing
about
regulatory,
and
has
to
be
read
in
the
same
fashion.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
third
subclause
there,
which
relates
to
insurance
requirements,
they
would
be
saying
that
municipalities
are
free
to
impose
their
own
insurance
requirements
upon
motor
carriers
of
property.
so,
fedex,
ups
in
different
municipalities
would
have
to
meet
different
insurance
requirements.
they'd
have
to
do
different
kinds
of
filings
and
have
very
different
kinds
of--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--it's
the
third
subclause
in
(2)(a).
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
and
that
is
completely
at
odds
with
the
statute
because
in
14504,
which
this
court
is
going
to
take
up
in
a
case
called
yellow
freight
next
term,
it
says
specifically
there...
congress
said
even
50
registrations
by
motor
carriers
of
property
in
different
states
for
insurance
purposes
is
too
many
for
our
taste.
we
think
there
should
only
be
one,
and
they
said
the
single
state--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--yes.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that
would
be
one
respect,
your
honor,
in
which
either...
if
it
was
a
general
traffic
regulation,
then
it
would
not
be
preempted
at
all.
or
if
it
were
preempted,
it
would
have
to
be
done
at
the
state
level
and
it
could
be
done
by
the--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--arguably
it
could
be,
but
i
believe
for
purposes
of
title
49,
it's
a
defined
term
to
include
streets.
but
our
point
there
was
that
it's
perfectly
sensible
for
congress
to
say
that
the
states
shall
deal
with
these
issues,
but
not
the
municipality.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
one
way
or
the
other.
but
again,
traffic
regulations--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--generally
are
not
within
the
preemption
clause.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yes.
the
legislative
history
here--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--yes,
i
understand.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
the
legislative
history
here
is
confused
and
somewhat
unilluminating.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
there
are
two
responses
to
that
question.
the
first
is
the
example
that
was
already
given
which
is
when
the
federal
government
puts
a
grant
to
a
municipality
full
stop
and
doesn't
allow
the
state
to
control
the
use
of
that
grant,
that's
an
example
like
this.
but
the
other
point
i
would
make
is
throughout
its
history,
congress
has--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--may
i--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
know
of
none,
but
this
is
a
new
departure
for
congress.
they
have
always
taken
free
markets
and
sought
to
regulate
them.
here
they're
taking
a
market
they
had
regulated
and
the
states
and
localities
had
regulated
and
they're
now
trying
to
deregulate
it.
that's
a
new
development
and
it
calls
for
new
measures.
and
the
measure
here
was
to
try
to
clear
away
all
this
underbrush
of...
of
state
and
local
restriction--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--congress
did
make
a
clear
statement
by
including
the
term,
political
subdivision,
whenever
it
wanted
political
subdivisions
to
either
have
authority
or
be
restricted
in
that
authority,
and
then
specifically
speaking
only
to
states
here.
there
could
not
be
a
clearer
statement
of
that.
why
else
ever
use
the
term,
political
subdivision?
that
is
unexplained.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
they
could
have
used
the
term
state
everywhere
alone
and
then
said,
state
but
not
political
subdivision,
here.
or
they
could
this
term,
state
and
political
subdivision,
everywhere
and
omit
the
term,
political
subdivision,
here.
those
are
the
same
meaning
and
they're
the
same
purpose.
and
again,
canons
of
construction
have
been
denigrated
in
this
case,
but
they
have
to
do
with
the
natural
and
ordinary
reading
of
statutes.
the
baseline
that
congress
uses
to
draft
laws
in
some
confidence
that
the
executive
branch
and
the
courts
will
interpret
them
as
congress
meant
them,
and
that's
exactly
what's--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--that's
a...
that's
a
statement
i
couldn't
disagree
with
more
strongly.
the
solicitor
general
here
has
conceded
they
have
no
authority
to
administer
this
statute.
the
notion
that
you
have
a--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--the...
the
notion
that
a
deregulatory
statute
that
took
governmental
entities
out
of
an
area
to
create
a
free
market
would
now
be
subject
to
umpiring
by
the
federal
agency,
in
terms
of
the
scope
of
preemption,
which
is
an
issue
this
court
has
always
said
is
for
the
courts
to
determine--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--their
construction
is
to
leave
them
as
an
umpire.
but
i
would
say
certainly
not
chevron
deference.
at
most
some
sort
of
skidmore
respect,
but
that's
only
entitled
where
there's
some
sort
of
reason
to
think
that
before
they
got
to
their
litigation
position
here,
which
has
migrated
in
the
course
of
this
case...
it
started
off
as
an
argument
about
repeal
by
implication.
it's
now
turned
into
argument
about
sort
of
reading
statutes
together
to
import
them
into
this
statute...
is
entitled
to
really,
i
think,
no
respect
here
because
it
is
not
persuasive.
they
have
not
analyzed
the
statute
in
detail--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--in
any
of
their
prior--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
wouldn't
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
but
again--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--we
agree,
but
that's
not
what
this
preemption
clause
is
about
or
any
preemption
clause
is
ever
about.
when
they
say
enact
or
enforce
here,
they
don't
use
it
in
the
terms
of
making
law
and
executing
the
law.
they
use
it
in
the...
in
the
sense
of
enacting
new
law
or
applying...
or
enforcing
and
applying
preexisting
law.
and
the
point
of
this
preemption
clause
is
to
say
that
municipalities
do
not
have
the
authority
to
act
in
this
realm
by
imposing
their
own
public
policies.
it's
a
matter
of
either
new
law
or
preexisting
law.
that's
the
structure
of
many
of
these
preemption
statutes
the
court
has
dealt
with.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
we
think
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear
here,
your
honor.
they
explicitly
extinguished
the
power
of
the
municipality--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--no.
there's
no
substantive
tenth
amendment
issue
here.
there's
no
commandeering
of
states
or
local
governments
to
enact
some
sort
of
program.
this
is
the
same
as
the
court
in
wolens
where
they
said
this
statute
must
be
read
to
say
the
state
cannot
legislate
in
this
area,
but
they
can
enforce
contracts
through
their
courts.
there's
no
tenth
amendment
problem
with
that.
that's
congress
exercising
its
power
under
the
supremacy
clause,
anything
in
the
laws
or
constitution
of
the
states
notwithstanding.
and
as
the
solicitor
general
said
in
the
brief
in
the
mortier
case,
the
notion
that
when
congress
decided
that
there
could
be
state
regulation
but
they
had
to
preempt
local
regulation,
that
they
would
somehow
have
to
be
forced
to
preempt
state
regulation
as
well,
simply
turns
the
tenth
amendment
on
its
head.
so,
we
don't
think
that
there's
any...
any
serious
constitutional
issue
here.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
no,
that's
not
what
it
boils
down.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
it
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
congress
deliberately
inserted
a
phrase
here,
political
subdivision
of
a
state,
so
that
it
can
preempt--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--and...
and
it--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--well,
it's...
it
is
clear,
i
believe,
because
it's
clear
because
they
said
a
state
cannot...
a
political
subdivision
cannot--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--and
they
state
the
authority
of
a
state
to
do
certain
things.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
no.
i
think
it
is
equally
detailed
and
specific.
and...
and
there's
no
rationale
for
congress
legislating
in
this
way
or
drafting
this
language
or
enacting
it
unless
they
intended
to
make
a
difference.
that's...
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
including
that
language.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
no.
text
and
context.
that's
correct.
