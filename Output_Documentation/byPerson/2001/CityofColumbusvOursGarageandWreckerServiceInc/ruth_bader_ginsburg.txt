mr.
sutton,
are
you
making
the
distinction
there
between
the
safety
regulations
which
would
be
covered
under
(c)(2)
and
the
economic
regulation
which
would
be
the
main
prohibition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there's
a
question
i
think
that
still
would
be
left
open
even
if
you
prevail;
that
is,
whether
these
regulations
are
appropriately
characterized
as
economic
or
safety.
you
say
they're
all
safety.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
hasn't
been
adjudicated
yet.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
what
extent,
mr.
stewart,
does
the
department
of
transportation...
you
said
there's
no
administrator
of
the
statute,
but
they
do
have
authority
under
the
motor
safety...
motor
carrier
safety
assistance
program
that
seems
to
be
relevant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
cordray,
that's
open.
mr.
sutton
said
that
that
question
whether
these
regulations
are
genuine
safety
regulations
or,
on
the
other
hand,
economic
is
not
determined
by
this
case.
here
the
question
is
whatever
is
safety,
may
the
state
delegate
that
authority
to
the
municipalities.
i
did
want
to
get
your
response
to
a
question
justice
kennedy
asked
mr....
and
it
was
answered
for
you
by
mr.
sutton.
suppose
the
state
says,
okay,
we
do
business
by
dealing
with
municipalities.
so,
we
will
simply
take
the
municipal
regulation
of
toledo
and
the
municipal
regulation
of
columbus,
and
we'll
put
it
all
together
in
one
package.
it
will
say,
state
regulation
of
safety,
and...
and
we'll
preserve
everything.
would
that
be
permissible
under
your
reading
of
this
federal
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
it's
strictly
a
question
of
form
that
we're
dealing
with,
that
states,
you
can
delegate
to
your
cities,
as
you
always
have,
just
say,
cities,
what
do
you
want
and
we'll
give
it
to
you
by
enacting
a
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cordray,
is
there...
is
there
an
example...
any
other
example
of
a
federal
statute...
i
mean,
it
is
unusual
to
say,
states,
you
can
no
longer
decide
how
your
authority
is
going
to
be
exercised.
an
ordinary
mode
of
a
state
exercising
its
authority
is
to
delegate
it
to
localities.
apart
from
this
statute,
is
there
any
other
federal
statute
that
says,
state,
you
may
do
it
but
you
may
not
delegate
it
to
a
regional
or
local
or
municipal
unit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
a
state...
that's...
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--congress
giving
money
to
a
municipality.
i
asked
an
instance
in
which
congress
says,
state,
you
may
do
it
but
you,
state,
may
not
delegate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
since
it
was...
since
you
say
it's
singular
and
this
is
new,
wouldn't
you
expect
congress
to
make
a
clear
statement
that
the
state
may
not
delegate
this
authority
because--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
state
may
not
delegate
this
authority
to
a
political
subdivision.
just
as
simple
as
that,
to
negate
what
has
been
the
assumption
all
along.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
executive
branch.
now,
you...
i
know
you
have
said,
and
i
quite
agree,
that
the
department
of
transportation
has
no
supervisory
authority,
it
has
no
chevron
deference.
but
doesn't
it
deserve
some
respect
from
the
courts
simply
because
it
has
familiarity
with
the
area
of
motor
carrier
regulation
that
the
courts
don't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they've
not
conceded
the
department
of
transportation...
you...
deserves
no
respect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
say
umpiring.
i
said
its
views
on
the
proper
construction
of
this
statute.
what
weight,
if
any,
should
this
court
give
to
the
department
of
transportation's
view,
this
is
what
the
statute
means?
not
as
an
umpire,
not
as
a
referee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
interstate
commerce
act
preempts
that
it
forbids
a
state
or
political
subdivision
of
a
state
from
enacting
of
enforcing
laws
or
regulation
affecting
motor
carriers
of
property,
but
the
act
also
provides
that
the
preemption
rule
shall
not
restrict
the
safety
regulatory
authority
of
the
state.
does
this
exception
to
preemption
cover
safety
regulations
enacted
or
enforced
by
localities?
that
is
the
question
this
case
presents.
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
local
regulations
are
preempted.
we
hold
that
safety
regulations
of
localities
as
well
as
those
of
state
are
safe
from
preemptio,
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
sixth
circuit’s
judgment.
the
city
of
columbus,
ohio
regulates
the
operation
of
tow
trucks
within
city
limits
by
local
ordinance.
a
local
tow
truck
operator
called
ours
garage
joined
by
a
trade
association
of
tow
truck
operators
commenced
this
litigation
seeking
to
establish
that
columbus’
rules
were
preempted
under
the
federal
act.
on
cross-motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
federal
district
court
ruled
in
the
favor
of
the
tow
truck
complainants,
now
respondents,
and
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
the
city
had
argued
that
its
regulations
was
saved
by
the
exception
for
state
regulatory
authority
over
safety
matters,
but
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
the
safety
exception
covered
only
state
not
local
regulations.
state
authority
generally
includes
the
choice
to
regulate
centrally
or
to
delegate
rule
making
and
enforcement
authority
to
localities.
the
sixth
circuit
so
acknowledged
but
it
declined
to
apply
that
general
rule
in
this
case
because
the
federal
preemption
provision
prefers
discretely
to
states
and
the
political
subdivisions
while
the
safety
exception
prefers
only
to
state
authority
and
does
not
mention
political
subdivisions.
explaining
why
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeal’s
judgment,
we
note
first
the
differences
in
the
phrasing
of
the
various
exceptions
to
preemption.
the
preemption
rule
itself
along
with
two
of
the
exceptions
use
the
words
authority
of
state
and
their
political
subdivisions
to
enact
or
enforce
regulations.
in
contrast,
the
safety
exception
and
another
exception
on
covering
shipping
of
household
goods
use
quite
different
more
concise
formulations.
the
argument
that
the
present
of
words
in
one
provision
and
their
absence
in
another
reveals
congress’
design
grows
weaker
with
each
difference
in
the
formulation
of
the
provisions
under
inspection.
further,
if
the
safety
exception
is
read
unyieldingly
to
cover
state
regulation
exclusively,
then
the
preemption
rule
will
prevent
localities
not
only
from
enacting
but
also
from
enforcing
coverage
safety
rules,
the
keywords
are
enact
or
enforce,
even
if
such
rules
were
passed
by
the
state
legislature,
but
that
would
make
scant
sense
for
state
law
is
commonly
enforced
by
local
governments.
most
important
to
our
decision,
construing
the
words
safety
authority
to
a
state
to
exclude
localities
would
yield
the
determination
at
odds
without
federal
system's
traditional
comprehension
of
the
state’s
historic
police
power.
safety
regulations
of
yield
in
which
customarily,
the
states
have
allowed
localities
to
address
local
concerns.
under
this
court’s
decisions
in
point,
it
takes
a
purpose
made
clear
and
manifest
by
congress
to
warrant
a
judicial
determination
that
the
national
legislator
cut
off
a
state’s
power
to
delegate
rule
making
authority
to
the
state’s
component
parts.
finding
no
such
clear
purpose
in
the
federal
act,
we
resist
attributing
to
congress
a
design
to
disturb
a
state’s
decision
on
the
division
of
authority
between
its
central
and
local
units
over
safety
on
municipal
streets
and
roads.
respondent’s
reading
becomes
all
the
more
curious,
we
finally
note,
given
their
affirmation
that
ohio
could
without
affront
to
the
federal
act
simply
adapt
columbus’
regulations
to
govern
in
that
city,
to
lead
those
regulations
to
govern
there
and
so
on
down
the
list
of
the
state’s
municipalities.

scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
o’connor
has
joined.
