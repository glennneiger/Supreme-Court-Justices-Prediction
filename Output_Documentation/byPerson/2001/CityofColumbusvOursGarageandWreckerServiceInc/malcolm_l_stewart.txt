mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
phrase,
safety
regulatory
authority
of
a
state,
in
section
14501(c)(2)(a)
is
most
naturally
read
to
encompass
the
state's
traditional
authority
to
delegate
its
powers
to
political
subdivisions.
that
view
is
supported
by
the
larger
statutory
context
in
which
the
phrase
appears
and
by
the
purposes
of
the
1994
act.
as
mr.
sutton
has
explained
and
as
this
court
has
frequently
recognized,
one
integral
component
of
the
state's
ability
to
regulate
within
its
borders
is
to
delegate
as
much
or
as
little
power
as
it
wishes
to
subordinate
political
units.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
guess
there
are
about
three
responses
we
would
make.
the
first
is,
as
mr.
sutton
points
out,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
other
provisions
are
identical
but
for
the
inclusion
of
the
word
political
subdivision.
for
instance,
in
subsection
(c)(2)(c),
which
is
at
the...
the
top
of
a-3
of
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--petitioners'
brief,
it
refers
to
the
authority
of
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision
of
a
state
to
enact
or
enforce
a
law.
now,
even
though
delegating
power
to
municipalities
is
an
integral
feature
of
the
state's
regulatory
authority,
it
would
certainly
be
less
than
clear
that
when
a
municipality
enacted
or
enforced
a
law,
pursuant
to
such
delegation,
it
could
not
necessarily
be
said
that
the
state
had
enacted
or
enforced
that
law.
and
so,
if
the
provision
left
out
political
subdivisions
and
simply
said
that
the
preemption
rule
does
not
apply
to
the
authority
of
a
state
to
enact
or
enforce
a
law,
there
would
be
ambiguity,
and
congress...
whether
it
was
necessary
or
not,
congress
might
rationally
choose
to
eliminate
that
potential
ambiguity
through
an
express
reference
to
political
subdivision.
but
the
phrase
that
appears
in
subsection
(2)(a)
is
simply
safety
regulatory
authority
of
a
state,
and
that,
as
you
say,
would
most
naturally
be
construed
to
encompass
the
authority
to
delegate
power
to
municipalities.
the
second
point
is
that
based
on
the
country's
traditions,
it
would
certainly
be
an
unusual
thing
for
congress
to
interfere
with
the
states'
decisions
as
to
the
amount
of
power
that
should
be
delegated
to
subordinate
political
units.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
believe
the
respondents
have
cited
a
couple
of
court
of
appeals
cases
which
have
held--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--none
from
this
court.
the...
the
respondents
have
not
cited
any
case
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
any
federal
statute
had
the
effect
of
divesting
a
state
of
its
authority
to
delegate
power
to
political
subdivisions.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
cited
the
lee
deadwood
case
in
our
brief
as
support
for
the
proposition
that
congress
would
constitutionally
be
authorized
to
preempt
municipal
law
without
preempting
state
law
if
it
chose.
our
only
point
is
it
would
be
sufficiently
unusual
that
we
would
expect
congress
to
address
the
matter
fairly
directly.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we...
i
think
that
as
it's
been
interpreted--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--as
it's
been
interpreted
below,
i
believe
the
types
of
regulations
that
have
been
held
preempted
are...
are
fairly
similar
to
the
city
of
columbus's
regulation,
namely,
a
licensing
scheme
in
which
the
vehicle
is
inspected,
the
driver
is
tested
to
ensure
proficiency
in
the
operation
of
the
vehicle.
and
those
have
been
held
to
be
preempted
on
the
ground
that
they
relate
to
routes--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
i
think
that
the
licensing
scheme,
while
we
would
respect
ohio's
decision
to
delegate
that
to
municipalities,
it...
in
truth
i
think
this
is
something
that
could
fairly
realistically
be
accomplished
at
the
state
level.
now,
with
respect
to
some
of
the
other
matters
that
are
specified
in
(c)(2)(a),
for
instance,
route
controls
based
on
size
and
weight
or
hazardous
nature
of
the
cargo,
because
the
determination
at
issue
is
whether
a
particular
vehicle
or
a
particular
cargo
is
suitable
for
a
particular
stretch
of
road,
those
are
the
sorts
of
things
that
can't
realistically
be
expected
to
be
done
in
their
entirety
at
the
state
level.
and
therefore,
it
would
be
a
particular
disruption
of
the
state's
processes--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
third
point
is
that
to
the
extent
that
the
provision
at
issue
here
is
ambiguous
and
the
court
wants
to
interpret
it
by
reference
to
other
relevant
statutory
provisions,
it
is
important
to
examine
the
larger
statutory
context.
that
is,
(c)(2)(a)
is
not
limited
to
safety.
it
specifies
these
other
matters,
and
as
mr.
sutton
was
pointing
out,
the
other
matters
are
covered
in
detail
in
different
provisions
of
title
49.
in
general,
those
other
provisions
of
title
49
contain
their
own
preemption
provisions.
they
explain
at...
at
great
length
what
states
can
and
can't
do.
at
least
in
the
area
of
safety,
state
law
is
specifically
defined
to
include
the
law
of
the
local
governmental
unit,
and
so
the...
the
safety
regime
in
the
other
parts
of
title
49
specifically
contemplates
municipal
safety
regulation.
and
it
would
be
odd
to
think
that
congress,
in
this
oblique
way,
has
superseded
that
carefully
developed
statutory
framework.
and
to
put
this
in
larger
historical
context,
to
follow
up
on
mr.
sutton's
point,
from
1966
to
1995,
at
the
federal
level
there
was
division
of
regulatory
authority
between
the
icc
which
did
economic
regulation
and
the
department
of
transportation
which
did
safety
regulation.
and
it's
no
coincidence
that
state
law
as
to
economic
matters
was
preempted
at
about
the
same
time
that
the
icc
saw
its
powers
diminished
and
the
icc
was
eventually
eliminated
altogether.
this
was
part
of
a
larger
program
of
deregulating
the
economics
of
commercial
trucking.
but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there...
there
is
no
federal
agency
entrusted
with
the
administration
of
this
particular
statute.
the
department
of
transportation
administers
the
related
provisions
of
title
49
that
are
specifically
addressed
to
these
matters,
and
their
implementation
of
their
responsibilities
under
those
provisions
would
be
affected
by
this
court's
decision
in
this
case
because
if
there
is
no
municipal
safety
regulation
at
all,
that
would
obviously
have
an
impact
on
their
administration
of
the
scheme
for
determining
when
municipal
regulation
is
and
is
not
permitted.
but
they
are
not
specifically
entrusted
with
authority
over
this
scheme.
so...
so
to
return
to
the
point
about
the
division
of
responsibilities,
congress
eliminated
the
icc,
eliminated
federal
economic
regulation
of
commercial
trucking,
and
at
the
same
time
it
preempted
state
law
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
states
didn't
undo
the
federal
deregulatory
efforts.
but
there's
been
no
federal
deregulation
in
matters
of
trucking
safety.
the
prior
provisions
of
title
49
remain
on
the
books.
there's
no
expression
of
congressional
discontent
with
the
manner
in
which
power
in
those
areas
has
been
divided
between
the
federal,
state,
and
local
governments.
to
the
contrary,
the
conference
report
accompanying
the
1994
act
refers
specifically
to
those
preexisting
provisions
and
expresses
the
intent
that
their
administration
continue
unchanged.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
motor
carrier
safety
assistance
program,
and
they
also
have
authority
under
other
provisions
of
title
49
to
review
and
declare
to
be
preempted
state
and
local
laws...
state
and
local
safety
laws
that
apply
to
transportation
in
interstate
commerce.
again,
those
are
not
provisions
of
this
particular
statute.
they
are
among
the
preexisting
provisions
of
title
49
that
were
intended
to
be
preserved
by
subsection
(c)(2)(a).
