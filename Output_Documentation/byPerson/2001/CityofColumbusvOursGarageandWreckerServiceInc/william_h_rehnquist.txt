we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
01-419,
city
of
columbus
v.
ours
garage
and
wrecker
service,
inc.--
mr.
sutton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
mr.
sutton,
is
that
the
first
section
(a)(1)
does
say,
no
state
or
political
subdivision
thereof
and
no
interstate
agency.
it
talks
about
a
political
subdivision
so
that
when
you
come
down
to
the
section
you've
just
quoted,
and
it
only
says
state,
there's
perhaps
a
fair
inference
that
only
a
state
and
not
a
political
subdivision
is
included.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where...
where
exactly
is
(c)(2)(a)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
about
a
restriction
that
on
a
particular
residential
street
that's,
nonetheless,
an
arterial
highway,
no
trucks
over
10
tons?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sutton.
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
cordray,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--why
would
congress
choose
to...
to
regulate
in
that
way,
say
we
want
the
state
to
do
it
but
not
the
locality?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
i'm
not
talking
about
licensing.
i'm
talking
about
the...
the
example
of,
say,
that
no
trucks
over
10
tons
on
this
particular
road.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
term,
motor
carriers
of
property...
does
that
mean
motor
carriers
of
property
for
hire
or
any
motor
carrier
that
is
carrying
property?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
which
does
it
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(c)(2)(a)
at
the
bottom
of
page
a-2
in
the
same
sentence
uses
this
shall
not
restrict
the
safety
regulatory
a
state...
authority
of
a
state
with
respect...
or
the
authority
of
a
state.
they
don't
use
the
adjective
regulatory
even
in
the
second
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
obviously,
i...
i
missed
it,
so
say
it
again.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
the
bottom
of
page
a-2.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if...
if
you
lose,
you
know--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
you're
changing
your
argument...
you
know,
if
you
lost
in
the
lower
court,
you'd
probably
be
well
advised
to
change
your
argument.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
cordray.
mr.
sutton,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's...
what's
congress's
authority
to
regulate
intrastate
commerce?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sutton.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-419
the
city
of
columbus
