how
do
you
describe
the
test
applied
by
the
board?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
should
there
be
any
other
component?
i
mean,
i
think
your
client
lost
basically.
so--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
else
should
be
part
of
the
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
there's
another
element
that
you're
ignoring.
i
thought
the
board
looked
both
at
whether
it
was
a
meritless
lawsuit
against
the
unions
and
whether
it
was
for
a
retaliatory
purpose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
the
other
element?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
and
how
do
we
define
retaliatory
purpose?
what...
what
constitutes
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
think,
in
the
board's
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
is
there
any
other
effect
by
virtue
of
the
finding
of
the
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
true
in
terms
of
money,
it's
the
fees.
is
there
any
other
effect--
--by
virtue
of
their
finding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
i...
do
you
agree
that
under
the
board's
rule
here
that
it
does
allow
the
board
to
find
the
unfair
labor
practice
and
impose
the
sanctions
on
litigation
brought
by
employers
that
is
not
limited
to
just
shams
and
abuse
of
process?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
does
allow
the
imposition
of
these
things
for
an
employer
suit
that
could
be
considered
objectively
reasonable
at
the
time
it
was
brought.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
that
have
the
necessary
effect
of
at
least
chilling
some
conduct
that
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it
does.
you
have
to...
you
would
have
to
concede
that
it
does.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
petitioner
is
an
industrial
contractor
which
received
a
contract
to
modernize
a
california
steel
mill.
the
petitioner
and
the
mill
owner
later
filed
a
federal
law
suit
against
several
unions
claiming
the
labor
unions
had
engaged
in
lobbying,
litigation,
and
other
activities
in
order
to
delay
the
project
because
the
petitioner
employed
non-union
employees.
the
petitioner
eventually
lost
or
withdrew
each
of
its
claims
in
the
law
suit.
in
the
meantime,
two
labor
unions
lodged
complaints
against
the
petitioner
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
board’s
general
counsel
then
issued
a
complaint
alleging
that
the
petitioner
had
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
filing
and
maintaining
it
federal
law
suit.
the
board
ruled
in
favor
of
the
general
counsel
finding
that
petitioner’s
law
suit
had
not
been
meritorious
and
had
been
filed
to
retaliate
against
the
unions.
the
board
ordered
the
petitioner
to
pay
the
union’s
legal
fees
to
stop
prosecuting
such
suits
and
to
post
notices
of
the
board’s
findings
at
appropriate
places.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
enforced
the
board’s
order.
we
granted
certiorari,
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse
and
remand.
the
first
amendment’s
petition
clause
protects
the
right
to
petition
the
government
for
a
redress
of
grievances.
we
have
considered
this
right
in
the
past
when
interpreting
certain
federal
laws.
for
example,
in
the
anit-trust
context,
we
have
held
that
genuine
petitioning
is
immune
from
anti-trust
liability.
this
case
raises
the
same
basic
issue
of
when
litigation,
a
form
of
petitioning,
may
be
found
to
violate
federal
law,
but
this
time,
we
deal
with
it
in
the
labor
law
context.
previously,
we
have
held
that
the
labor
relations
board
may
enjoin
baseless
lawsuits
brought
with
the
retaliatory
motive,
but
the
issue
here
is
the
standard
for
declaring
completed
law
suits
unlawful
with
respect
to
a
class
of
lawsuits
that
are
not
baseless.
in
the
anti-trust
context,
our
standard
for
immunity
protects
all
reasonably
based
petitioning
or
lawsuits
as
well
as
all
petitioning
unmotivated
by
anti-competitive
intent.
the
labor
relations
board
argues
that
such
broad
immunity
is
unnecessary
here
because
most
labor
law
adjudications
cannot
be
launched
solely
by
private
action
and
because
the
board’s
remedies
are
not
punitive.
but
this
does
not
mean
that
the
board’s
penalties
raise
no
first
amendment
concerns
for
if
the
board
can
declare
a
suit
unlawful,
the
finding
of
illegality
alone
is
a
burden
on
petitioning.
here,
such
a
burden
affects
a
class
of
reasonably
based
but
unsuccessful
lawsuits
that
the
board
finds
to
be
retaliatory.
although
we
have
analogized
baseless
lawsuits,
default
statements
that
are
outside
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment,
that
analogy
does
not
directly
extend
to
reasonably
based
but
unsuccessful
lawsuits.
the
board
confines
its
penalties
to
retaliatory
suits
which
it
defines
as
suit
brought
with
a
motive
to
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
rights
protected
by
federal
labor
law,
but
even
with
this
limitation,
the
board’s
standard
is
still
broad
enough
to
cover
many
suits
that
are
genuine
attempts
to
test
the
legality
of
conduct
the
plaintiff
reasonably
believes
to
be
illegal
under
other
federal
law.
thus,
there
is
a
serious
constitutional
question
under
the
first
amendment.
since
nothing
in
the
relevant
statutory
text
requires
that
the
statute
be
read
so
broadly
as
to
reach
all
reasonably
based
but
unsuccessful
lawsuits
filed
with
a
retaliatory
purpose,
we
decline
to
do
so.
we
hold
that
the
board’s
standard
is
invalid
under
the
applicable
statute.
we
reverse
the
sixth
circuit’s
judgment
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
