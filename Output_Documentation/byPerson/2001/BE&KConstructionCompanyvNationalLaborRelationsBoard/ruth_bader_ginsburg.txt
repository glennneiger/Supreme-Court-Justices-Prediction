mr.
baskin,
back
up
a
bit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
the
court
in
that
very
paragraph
gave
a
definition
of
what
it
meant.
so,
i
wouldn't
look
outside
this
document
for
what
the
court
meant
by
with
merit/without
merit
when
the...
look
at
the
sentence
in
the
middle
of
that
paragraph.
it
says
if
the
judgment
goes
against
the
employer
and
the
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
judgment
against
you.
or
if
his
suit
is
withdrawn
or
is
otherwise
shown
to
be
without
merit.
otherwise
shown
to
be
merit.
i
took
that
to
mean
if
you
lose,
it's
shown
to
be
without
merit.
there
may
be
other
situations
in
which
it's
shown
to
be
without
merit.
so,
it
seems
to
me
the
best
place
to
find
out
what
the
court
meant
merit/without
merit
is
the
very
opinion
that
we're
construing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
fact
that
it's
triple
damages
is
a
little
different
than
fee-shifting.
so,
one
could
easily
say,
when
you're
exposed
to
treble
damages,
putative
damages,
yes,
that's
a
punishment.
here
fee-shifting
is
the
rule
in
most
countries
in
the
world.
so,
what
is
the
more
here?
i
understand
the
more
in
antitrust
cases,
treble
damages.
here
you
say,
well,
there's
a
finding
that
you
have
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice.
what
are
the
consequences
in
addition
to
that
you
have
to
pay
the
other
side's
legal
fees?
what
are
the
adverse
consequences--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--explain
that.
you
did
say
that
in
your
brief
about
debarment,
and
i
didn't...
i
can
understand
when
you
say
someone...
someone's
reputation
is
affected
by
being
labeled
a
law
violator.
but
you
said
something
about...
about
the
jeopardy
of
debarment
and
i
wasn't
clear
how
that
would
work.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
do
with
the
2
decades
that
have
elapsed...
about
2
decades...
since
justice
white's
opinion
which
has
been
interpreted
by
the
board
the
way
the
language
most
naturally
reads?
the
one
thing
is
to
say
when
the
case
first
came
out
it
was
ambiguous.
but
now
we
have
2
decades
of
consistent
interpretation
of
that
language
by
the
board.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
baskin,
that...
that
goes
back
every
time
to
how
you
construe
this
paragraph,
and
so
if
the
position
that
justice
white
is
making
a
distinction
here
between,
on
the
one
hand,
an
ongoing
proceeding...
the
first
amendment
says
you
can't
stop
it.
never
mind
deference
to
state
courts.
that's
another
consideration
that
weighs
it
to
the
same
end,
but
traditionally
under
the
first
amendment,
a
prior
restraint,
stop
it,
has
been
what
the
court
has
looked
at
most
cautiously.
then
justice
white
tells
us,
but
it's
different
once
the
adjudication
is
over.
the...
the
line
between
prior
restraint
and
subsequent
punishment
goes
all
the
way
through
first
amendment
learning,
and
you
treat
this
as,
well,
ambiguous,
but
if
it
were
clear
it's
that
there's
any
difference
between
stopping
an
ongoing
proceeding
and
looking
at
a
situation
after
it's
been
adjudicated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
mr.
baskin
told
us
that
there
are
punitive
aspects
to
this
that
could
lead
to
debarment
he
said.
so,
it's
not
simply
to
provide
for
fee-shifting,
but
that
there
are
heavy
consequences.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
is
retaliatory
motive...
is
that
before
us
in
this
case?
i
mean,
it
may
be
that
this
court,
by
saying
that
the
board...
that
there
was,
even
in
this
case,
insufficient
evidence
of
retaliatory
motive,
but
i
didn't
think
that
was
the
question
presented
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
on
that,
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
well,
what
is
it
that
shows
that
this
was
in
retaliation
for
violation
of
section
7
rights
instead
of
being
in...
in
response
to
the
union's
desire
simply
to
harass
the
employer?
i
think
that
there
are
very
serious
questions
about
that,
but
my
view
was
of
this
case
that...
that
wasn't
before
us.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
wallace,
we
are
concerned
with
the
bill
johnson's
case,
and
a
question
has
been
raised
about
where
does
the
authority
to
come...
come
from
for
this
fee-shifting.
it
does
appear
in
the
court's
opinion
in
bill
johnson's.
if
a
violation
is
found,
the
board
may
order
the
employer
to
reimburse
the
employees,
whom
he
has
wrongfully
sued,
for
their
attorney's
fees.
where
did
the
court
come
up
with
that
fee-shifting?
was
that
something
that
the
board
had
been
doing?
did
the
government
propose
it?
but
it's
right
there
in
the
court's
of
opinion
that
the
proper
remedy
is
fee-shifting.
