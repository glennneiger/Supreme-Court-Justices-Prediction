mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
board
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
had
no
difficulty
in
reading
bill
johnson's
the
way
i
think
most
people
would
read
this
court's
opinion
as
comprehensively
addressing
what
the
board
was
doing
with
respect
to
the
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8(a)(1)
of
the
filing
of--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--retaliatory
lawsuits.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
didn't
hear
you.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
disagree
with
that,
and...
and
no
court
of
appeals
that
has
reviewed
board
decisions
since
bill
johnson's
has
read
it
that
way.
the
court
quite
clearly
distinguished
between
enjoining
ongoing
lawsuits,
which
it
said
could
be
done
only
if
the
lawsuit
was
baseless.
otherwise,
the
board
has
to
wait
until
the
lawsuit
has
been
resolved.
if
the
lawsuit
turned
out
favorably
to
the
employer,
then
it
could
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
but
if
the
lawsuit
turned
out
to
be
unmeritorious,
if
the
employer
lost,
then
the
board
could
consider
whether
it
was
filed
for
a
retaliatory
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
beg
to
differ.
the
court
specifically
noted
that
some
of
the
claims
of
the
employer
had
already
been
dismissed
in
the
state
courts,
and
in
footnote
15,
at
the
end
of
the...
its
opinion,
it
said
the
board,
therefore,
can
use
the
criteria
we--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it...
it
was
a
direction
for
how
further
proceedings
in
the
case
should
be
handled.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
any
event,
if
i
may
turn
now
to
address
the
question
that
the
court
asked
the
parties
to
address
in
formulating
the
question
presented
here.
our
submission
in
this
case
is
that
this
court's
holding
in
professional
real
estate
investors
interpreting
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
court's
decision
in
bill
johnson's,
including
this...
these
dicta
to
govern
further
proceedings
interpreting
the
national
labor
relations
act,
are
entirely
compatible
with
one
another
in
light
of
the
important
differences
in
the
purposes,
processes,
remedies,
and
practicalities
of
enforcement
that
were
implicated
in
the
two
statutory
schemes
at
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
board
is
not
contradicting
anything
found
by
the
courts.
the
question
of
retaliatory
motive
was
not
at
issue
in
the
underlying
litigation,
and
the
board
has
to
wait
under
this
court's
decision
in
bill
johnson's
before
it
addresses
the
question
of
whether
there's
been
an
unfair
labor
practice--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the...
the
cases
against
unions
are
much
less
numerous
to
begin
with
because
unions
are
less
apt
to
bring
lawsuits
to
interfere
with
the
rights
of
employees
under
section
7
for
concerted
activity.
we're
talking
about
a
retaliation
against
section
7
rights.
usually
that's
been
the
subject
of
employer
suits,
but
the
board
does
apply
the
same
test
when--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but
those
were
against
the
employer,
and...
and
they--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
would
have
to
be
a
showing
a
violation
by
the
union
of
8(b)(4),
not...
not
that
the
lawsuit
was
an
8(a)(1)
violation
against
the
concerted
activities
rights
of
employees.
the
employer
would
have
to
show
that
the
union
lawsuit
violated
duties
that
the
union
owes,
and
that
was
resolved
against
the
employer
on
the
merits
in
this
case
because
the...
the
subject
of
the
lawsuits
was
about
working
conditions
at
the
site
of
employment,
which
was
a
legitimate
union
concern.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
isn't
punishment.
it's
make-whole
relief
under
an
administrative
scheme
which
is
meant
to
protect
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
concerted
rights,
and
it
involves
no
contradiction
of
any
issue
that
was
before
the...
the
court
in
the
underlying
litigation
which
did
not
have
occasion
to
address
whether
the
suit
was
brought
for
a
retaliatory
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the...
the
case
to
which
the
chief
justice
referred
earlier,
wisconsin
department
of
industrial
relations
against
gould,
was
one
in
which
this
court
held
that
wisconsin
law
was
preempted,
and
wisconsin
could
not
refuse
to
make
purchases,
state
purchases,
from
companies
that
had
been
found
to
have
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act
because
the
whole
purpose
of
the
remedy
scheme
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
remedial
and
the
remedies
are
limited,
and
the
idea
is
to
get
labor
disputes
behind
us,
not
to
have
disruptions
of
the
economy,
to
keep
productivity
going,
and
to
keep
the
people
employed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i...
i
wouldn't
think
that...
that
anything
would
turn
on
it,
but
it
is
not
punitive.
the
only
remedy
that's
granted
is
a
make-whole
remedy
that
the
costs
incurred
by
the
prevailing
defendants
in
a
suit
brought
for
an
improper
motive,
namely
to
coerce
those
defendants
in
the
exercise
of
rights
granted
them
by
federal
statute
when
suit
turned
out--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--notice
is
to
be
posted.
the
cease
and
desist
order
issues.
those...
those
parts
of
the
remedy
were
not
challenged
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
board
proceedings
are
much
less
burdensome
than...
than
court
proceedings
to
those
that
are
issue,
and
the
court
held
in
bill
johnson's
that
the
board
remedy
of
recompensing
the
defendants
who
prevailed
in
this
suit
for
their
costs,
because
the
suit
was
brought
to
defeat
their
section
7
rights,
was
a
permissible
remedy
by
the
board.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
they
held
it
in
the
sense
of...
of
prescribing
that
rule
for
the
further
proceedings
to
be
held
in
that
very
case
on
remand
from
the
court's
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
when
the
court
prescribes
a
rule
of
that
nature,
the
united
states
considers
itself
bound
by
it
in
its
further
handling--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--exactly
so.
that...
i
thought
the
court
made
it
quite
clear
in
bill
johnson's
that
as
long
as
the
suit
was
an
unmeritorious
one,
in
the
sense
that
it
did
not
prevail,
the
board
could
afford
the
limited
remedy
that's
available
under
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
it...
it's
a
far
less
daunting
situation
than
what
the
court
was
faced
with
under
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
professional
real
estate
investors
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
absolutely.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but,
of
course,
the
board's
findings
are
subject
to
judicial
review.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
this
court's
make
it
quite...
this
court's
decisions
make
it
quite
clear
that
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
it
is
board
rather
than
courts
that
have
the
responsibility
of
ruling
about
unfair
labor
practices.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
make-whole
relief--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--not...
not
at
all.
that's...
that
is
what
is
at
issue,
and
the...
the
national
labor
relations
act
authorizes
the
board,
under
this
court's
opinion
in
bill
johnson's,
to
afford
that
kind
of
a
limited
remedy--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's
approximately
it,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
can...
there
can
be
cases
in
which
a
voluntary
dismissal
was
taken
with
prejudice.
sometimes
the
question
of
whether
it
was
an
unmeritorious
suit
becomes
a
debatable
question.
but
ordinarily
it's
one,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
in
which
the
courts
have
ruled
against
claims
that
the
employer
made.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we...
we
didn't
come
up
with
analogies
in
which
regulatory
agencies
do
the
fee-shifting.
there
are
certainly
many
statutes
that
provide
for
fee-shifting.
the
fogerty
case
discusses
a
number
of
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
not
a
reference
to
fee-shifting
as
such
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
but
congress
did
say
in
section
8(a)(1)
that
it
shall
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
an
employee
to
interfere
with,
restrain,
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
the
concerted
activity
rights
for
mutual
aid
and
protection
that
are
guaranteed
in
section
7.
and
this
court
in
bill
johnson's
recognized
that
there
had
been
a
history
of
the
use
of
the
courts
for
that
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
retaliatory
motive
would
be...
it
would
have
to
be
shown
that
the
suit
was
brought
for
the
purpose
of
coercing,
discouraging,
suppressing,
restraining
the
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the...
the
board
addresses
that
question
in
light
of
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
to
the
extent
that
the
suit
was
not
baseless
in
law
or
fact
that
the
employer
brought--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
weighs
in
the
employer's
favor.
there
are
other
factors
that
weigh
against
the
employer.
in
this--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
only
if
the
employer
has
brought
suits
against
the
union
or
the
employees.
it
certainly
can
defend
against
any
suit--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--this
court
did
not
indicate
in
any
way
that
it
could
not
reexamine,
modify
the
rules
of
noerr-pennington
or
of
professional
real
estate.
the
court--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it...
it
certainly
construed
the
antitrust
laws
in
light
of
the
fact
that
those
laws
focus
mostly
on
private
conduct
in
the
marketplace,
not
on
petitioning
for
government-imposed
restraints,
and
that
there
was
a
need
in
construing
them
not
to...
to
allow
improper
chilling
of
the
bringing
of
lawsuits
or
other
forms
of
petitioning
activity.
and
in...
in
professional
real
estate
itself,
the
procedural
posture
focused
on
the
need
for
summary
judgment
to
be
available
against
a
counterclaim
for
treble
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws
in
circumstances
in
which
the
counterclaimant,
after
the
underlying
copyright
infringement
suit
was
found
to
be
objectively
reasonable,
was
saying,
but
i
still
need
further
discovery
in
order
to
ascertain
the
intent
and
motives
of
the
original
plaintiff
in
bringing
the
copyright
infringement
suit
because
it's
my
view
that...
that
they
didn't
really
expect
to
prevail
and
that
they
were
bringing
it
for
anticompetitive
purposes.
and
the
danger
that
the
court
was
addressing
there
was
that
much
of
the
protective
quality
of
the
noerr
doctrine
itself
could
be
undermined
if
the
original
lawsuit
that
supposedly
is
protected
could
be
chilled
by
the
prospect
of
burdensome
discovery
and
treble
damages.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there...
there
is
a
very
limited
remedy
available
here
compared
to
the
prospect
that
treble
damages
might
be
awarded
on
the
basis
of
rather
unpredictable
findings
about
subjective
motivation
in
bringing
the
lawsuit.
and
it...
it...
it's
a
remedy
that's
been
applied
against
a
background
of
what
this
court
in
bill
johnson's
referred
to
as
a...
a
powerful
tool.
powerful
was
the
word
the
court
used.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
agree
with
you
on
that
point,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i...
i
agree
with
you
completely.
in
fact--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it's
certainly
part
of
the
background
of
the
case,
but
the
court
did
limit
the
grant
of
certiorari
to
whether
these
two
decisions
are
compatible
given
the
differences
between
the
two
acts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
seldom
direct
evidence
of
that
kind,
although
occasionally
there
is
direct
evidence
of
animus
in
the
bringing
of
the
suit.
but
the
board
has
relied
on
a
number
of
factors,
which
we've
set
out
on
page
47
of
our
brief,
in
various...
in
various
cases
in
seeing
retaliatory
motive.
in
this
case
one
of
the
more
persuasive
ones
was
that
the
lawsuit
was
brought
against
parties
that
the
plaintiff
knew
or
should
have
known
did
not
participate
in
the
allegedly
unlawful
conduct.
they
included
as
defendants
unions
that
had
not--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
the...
the
petition--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--was
about
the
compatibility
of
the
court's
decision
in
professional
real
estate
with
what
we
had
taken
to
be
the
court's
clear
prescription
of
the
limits
on
the
remedy
of
the
8(a)(1)
and
unfair
labor
practice
in
the
bill
johnson's
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
precisely
so.
but
the
board
had
been
doing
it
regardless
of
the
merits
of
the
underlying
lawsuit.
the
board
had
become
so
concerned
with
the
use
of
the
courts
for
retaliatory
litigation
that
whether
the
lawsuit
was
meritorious
or
not,
if
it
found
that
it
was
brought
for
the
purpose
of
defeating
section
7
rights,
it
was
awarding
fees.
and
the
court
said,
no,
wait
a
minute.
you
can't
do
that
and
you
can't
enjoin
lawsuits
that
are
not
baseless.
the
court
was
really
correcting
the
board
and
reining
in
that
remedy
in
a
way
that
the
board
has
complied
with.
