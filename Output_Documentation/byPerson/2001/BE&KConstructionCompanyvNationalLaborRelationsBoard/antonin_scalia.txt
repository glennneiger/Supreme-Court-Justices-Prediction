justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
baskin,
is
your...
is
your
argument...
in
your
opening
remarks,
you...
you
referred
only
to
the
first
amendment.
is...
is
it...
is
it
a
constitutional
argument
you're
making?
to...
to
agree
with
you
here,
do
i
have
to
agree
that
if
congress
passed
a
law
adopting
the
english
rule
on...
on
attorney's
fees,
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
says...
so,
it's
a
statutory
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
too
fuzzy
for
me.
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
a...
is
it...
does
the
constitution
prohibit
it
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
constitution
prohibits.
so,
your
answer
to
my
question
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you...
you
cannot...
that
congress
could
not
adopt
the
english
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
do
that
by
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
why
do
you
say
it's
been
in
doubt
for
most
of
the
20-year
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
it
has
been
contested
constantly
during
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--20...
20-year
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
did
say
that,
but
of
course,
that
was
not
the
situation
before
the
court.
i
mean,
it...
it
may
be
the
clearest
dictum
in
the
world.
it
may
be
the
dictum
closest
to
a
holding
possible,
but
it
is
still
dictum.
the
court
did
not
have
before
it
a
case
in
which
the
employer
had
already
brought
the
suit
and
had
lost.
now,
you
know,
it
said
what
would
happen
in
that
situation,
and
you
know,
i
think
that's
entitled
to
some
weight.
but
the
issue
that
your
opponent
wants
to
argue
here
is
whether
the
court
was
wrong
to
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
those
cases
were
not
before
them.
it
said
what
the
board
can
do
in
those
cases
that
are
not
now
before
us.
as
i
say,
it
may
be
a
dictum
that
is
the
very
next
thing
to
a
holding,
but
it
is
not
a
holding.
those
were
not
cases
that
the
court
had
in
front
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly,
as
many
dicta
are.
as
many
dicta
are,
and
we
do
not
always
observe
those
directions
when
we...
when
we
have
the
opportunity
to
examine
the
matter
in
a...
in
a
more
immediate
context.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i
have
one
particular
difference
in
mind
that
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on.
i...
i...
it's...
it
seems
to
me
that
what
is
sought
to
be
done
here
is
much
worse
as
far
as
the
independence
of
the
courts
and
the
guarantee
of
access
to
the
courts
by...
by
the
citizenry
is
concerned
than
what
was
sought
to
be
done
in...
in...
what
case...
professional
real
estate.
and
this
is
the
difference.
in
professional
real
estate,
it
would
have
been
the
courts
that
would
have
decided
the
facts
which
would
have
imposed
upon
the
losing
party
attorney's
fees.
in
this
situation,
it
is
going
to
be
the
labor
board
that
will
decide
the
factual
question
of
whether
there
was
a
retaliatory
motive,
and
the
courts
will
have
to
defer
to
that
factual
finding
if
there
is
a
basis
in
the
record,
whether
the
courts
agree
with
it
or
not.
i
find
it
quite
offensive
to
think
that
article
iii
courts
are
going
to
be
told
that
certain
people
who
have
come
to
them
for
relief
will
pay
a
penalty
for
doing
so
on
the
basis
of
a
retaliatory
motive
found
not
by
article
iii
courts
at
all
but
by
the
labor
court...
but
by
the
labor
board.
in
that
respect,
this
case
is
much
worse
than...
than
what
was
going
on
in...
in
professional
real
estate.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
will
address
it
in
a
proceeding
before
the
board.
they
will
find
an
unfair
labor
practice
on
the
basis
of
their
finding
of
a
retaliatory
motive.
and
i...
i
note,
by
the
way,
as
to,
you
know,
how...
how
much
we
can
trust
those...
those
findings...
i
had
one
of
my
law
clerks
look
up
how
many...
how
many
times
the
board
has
imposed
this
kind
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
penalty
for...
for
bringing
a
lawsuit.
since
the
power
systems
case
in
'78,
which
is
when
they
started
this
process,
they
have
26
decisions
ordering
the
employer
to
pay
attorney's
fees
incurred
in
defending
a
lawsuit
and
3
decisions
in
which
it...
it
ordered
a
union
to
do
so.
now,
is...
is
there
some
reason
that
unions
are
not
using
lawyers
as
much
as
companies
are
these
days?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
were
union
lawsuits
in
this
present
case,
weren't
there?
plenty
of
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
suits...
suits
against
the
employer
can
certainly
be
brought
to
impair
the...
the
rights
of
the
employees
not
to...
not
to
unionize.
justice
antonin
scalia
never...
never
mind
the
26
to
3.
just...
just
tell
me
why
i...
as...
as
an
article
iii
judge,
i
should
not
be
concerned
about
leaving
it
to
a
federal
agency
to
make
the
factual
finding
that
will
determine
whether
somebody
will
be
punished
for
bringing
a
reasonable
lawsuit,
although
one
which
ultimately
loses
in
federal
courts.
why
shouldn't
i
be
concerned
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
just
talk
about
the
make-whole
remedy.
we
held
in
1982
that
in
a
private
suit
for
an
unfair
labor
practice,
which
provides
for
making
whole
the...
the
plaintiff
for...
for
his
damages,
there
was
no
authority
in
the
court
to
award
attorney's
fees,
that
making
whole
there
did
not
include
attorney's
fees.
what...
and...
and,
you
know,
the
language
was
very
clear
about
the
american
rule
and
what
a...
what
a
change
it
would
be.
why...
why
should
it
be
any
different
when
the
unfair
labor
practice
is...
is
decreed
by
the
board
rather
than
in
a
private
action?
it
doesn't
say
explicitly
that
you
can
get
attorney's
fees,
just
as...
just
as
the
other...
the...
the
private
action
provision
didn't
say
explicitly.
it
just
said,
you
know,
whatever
damages
you
have.
and
damages
were
not
intended
to
include
that.
why
should
we
hold
any
differently
in
this
situation,
especially
when
the
result
is
to
leave
it
to
the
board
to
decide
whether...
whether
somebody
will
be
punished
for
bringing
a
meritorious
but
ultimately
unsuccessful
suit
in
federal
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
held
it
or...
or
said
it.
i
mean,
that...
that's
one
of
the
disputes
here,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
just
going
around
the
dictum
point
again.
i
consider
it
dictum,
and...
and
the
issue
is
whether
that
was
a
wise
thing
to
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i'm...
i'm
not
criticizing
you
for
arguing
the
point,
certainly
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it's
where
the
board
finds--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
those
where
the
board
and
not
federal
courts
on
their
own
find
a
retaliatory
motive.
justice
antonin
scalia
for...
so
long
as
there's
substantial
evidence,
which
means...
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
parts
of
this
statutory
proceeding
do
not
exclude
the
federal
courts
from
their
business,
do
they,
which
this
does
by
imposing
penalties
upon
people
who
come
to
the
federal
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
agree
with
that
and
the
only
issue
is
whether
that
statutory
provision
places
within
the
board
the
power
to
impose
this
particular
sanction
for
an
unfair
labor
practice,
a
penalty
for
bringing
a
meritorious
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
have
to
be
very
explicit
because
it's
such
an
extraordinary
thing.
that's
what
our
jurisprudence
very
clearly
says.
and
here
with...
with
no
more
explicitness
than
there
was
in
the
case
in
summit
valley,
the...
the
agency
is
assuming
the
power
to
fee-shift
and
to
make
the
factual
determination
upon
which
the
fee-shifting
turns.
i
think
that's
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
have
to
defer
both
to
the
board's
determination
of
what
constitutes
a
retaliatory
motive
and,
even
more
so,
to
the
board's
factual
determination
that
retaliatory
motive
existed.
all
it
takes
is
one
witness
who
says
it
existed,
and
that
would
constitute
substantial
evidence.
and
if
the
board
goes
with
that
witness,
the
courts
have
to
effectively
penalize
the
company
for
seeking
resort
in
the
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
only
one...
one
where
what?
