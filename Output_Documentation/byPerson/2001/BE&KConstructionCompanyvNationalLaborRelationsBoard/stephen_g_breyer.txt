justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
happened
to
say
precisely
what
the
nlrb
said
it
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
a
judgment
goes
against
the
employer
in
the
state
court,
if
it
goes
against
him,
then
he's
had
his
day
in
court.
and
then
the
board
may
proceed
to
adjudicate
the
unfair
practice
claim,
and
then
the
employer's
suit,
having
been
proved
unmeritorious,
the
board
can
take
that
fact
into
account
when
it
decides
the
labor
law
violation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you've
been
reading
three
cases
to
us,
so
that
seems
to
be
the
language
that
you
have.
i...
i
read
that
as
saying
you
lose.
period.
end
of
the
matter.
that's
what
the
board
decides.
now,
i
put
that
so
you'll
reply
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
you
to
address,
if
i
can
go
back
to
the...
what
i
think
was
the
chief
justice's
question.
your...
your
basic
point,
i
take
it,
assuming
with
you,
as
i
will,
for
the
moment
that
the
language
is
ambiguous
in
bill
johnson,
is
that
we
should
treat
or
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
as
treating
the
antitrust
statute
and
the
labor
statute
a
case
brought
by
a
defendant
the
same
way.
and
obvious
differences,
which
i'd
like
you
to
address,
are
that,
one,
there
is
a
history
in
the
labor
law
of
employers
using
cases
brought
at
law
either
to
break
unions
or
to
win
disputes.
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
nlra
was
passed.
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
antitrust
laws.
there
is
no
such
history.
second,
the
employer...
the...
the
matter
is
committed
to
an
expert
board
in
the
labor
area,
which
apparently
believes
that
the
way
to
enforce
the
labor
law,
unlike
the
antitrust
law,
is
to
say
the
sham
exception
exists
before
the
case
is
decided,
but
once
the
case
is
decided,
we're
going
to
keep
employers
out
of
the
courts
by
saying
if
they
lose,
that's
the
end
of
any
immunity
that
they
get.
and
we
will
now
look
to
what
their
motive
was
in
bringing
this
lawsuit.
we
have
an
expert
board.
we
have
a
different
history.
we
have
different
statutes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now,
what
is
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
obviously...
look--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i...
but
i'm
trying
to
stay
away
from
bill
johnson
because
obviously
if
you're
right
that
the
statute
holds
it,
i
mean,
i...
all
right.
go
ahead.
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
i
mean,
that's
a
normal
problem,
isn't
it,
with
the
labor
statutes
and
most
other
statutes.
it
forbids
retaliatory
behavior.
of
course,
you'll
have
cases
where
people
make
the
wrong
decision
about
it,
where
it's
hard
to
predict,
and
so
forth.
but
that's
the
general
situation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
trying
to
carve
out
a...
an
exception
where
you're
home
free
from
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
the
make-whole
relief
simply
that
they've
said,
since
ours
is
a
statute
which
foresees
taking
labor
disputes
out
of
the
courts
and
putting
them
into
the
board,
since
that's
why
it
was
passed,
we're
going
to
say
a...
a
loser
in
a
federal
lawsuit
that
violates
that
basic
underlying
purpose
has
to
pay
attorney's
fees
to
the
winner?
now,
is
there
anything
here
other
than
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
is...
i'm
sorry.
is
there
any
authority?
i
mean,
i
thought,
as
a
matter
of
proposition,
maybe
there
would
be
some
authority
like
a...
an
electricity
generating
regulator
would
have
said
in
certain
kinds
of
lawsuits,
you
have
to
have
fee-shifting.
the
sec
might
say
in
certain
kinds
of
lawsuits,
certain
companies
have
to
pay
attorney's
fees.
the
barbers'
regulator
might
say
in
certain
union...
or
certain...
certain
instances
the
barbers
have
to
pay
the
legal
fees
of
somebody
else.
is...
is
there
any
comparable
authority
any
other
place
that
you've
found?
it...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
an
absurd
proposition
of
law
or
of
constitutional
law
that
a
regulator
who's
in
charge
of
a
particular
group
of
individuals
or
businesses
says
in
particular
circumstances
there
will
be
fee-shifting.
but
maybe
that's
total...
maybe
this
is
the
only
case
that's
ever
come
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
know...
as
long
as
you're
finished,
i
thought
the
26
cases
were
26
cases
in
which
they
awarded
attorney's
fees.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
i
thought
they
weren't
supposed
to
award
attorney's
fees
or
anything
unless
there
was
a
retaliatory
motive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
no,
but
i
mean,
of
course
they
did.
i
mean,
how
many
cases
where
there
where
people
alleged
retaliatory
motive
and
they
found
the
opposite?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
those
are
the
ones
where
they
won.
how
many
did
they
lose?
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
this
26
case
business.
i
thought
the
26
cases
were
the
ones
that
they
awarded
it
in,
and
i
thought
they
were
only
supposed
to
award
it
where
it's
retaliatory.
so,
it's
hardly
surprising
it's
retaliatory.
