may
i
just
ask
this,
mr.
baskin?
do
you
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
an
ongoing
case
and
a
completed
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the...
in
your
view,
the
standard
is
the
same.
it's
not
that
the
board
tries
to
enjoin
the
proceeding
as...
as
opposed
to
later
on
bringing
an
unfair
labor
practice
after
it's
over.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
should
be,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
that
johnson
says
it's
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
at
least
it
says
there's
a
different
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
view
is
there
should
be
no
different
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
the
whole
key
to
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
won
over
half
their
cases,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
they
win...
they
won
some
15
out
of
their
29
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
ask...
talking
about
the
history
of
the
case,
could
you
tell
me
how
did
this
case
end
up
in
the
sixth
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
first
amendment
argument
goes
by
the
boards
once
the
case
is
over.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
isn't
it
correct
that
the
scope
of
chilling
is
limited
to
those
with
a
retaliatory
motive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--should
be
chilled
in
those
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
every
8(a)(1)
case,
the
retaliatory
motive
is
found
by
the
board.
that's
part
of
the
statutory
proceeding,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
an
issue
that
was
raised
by
question
3
of
the
cert
petition,
and
we
didn't
grant
it.
