justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i...
i
have...
i
have
the
same
question
that
i
think
underlies
justice
breyer's
concern.
you
would
seem
to
give
zero
weight
to
the
board's
interest
in
stopping
a
purely
retaliatory
suit.
the
board
says,
now,
you
have
organized
this
clerical
unit
and
if...
if
you
persist
in
your
union
activity,
we're
going
to
sue
you
for
the
way
you've
been
keeping
our
books.
we're
going
to
sue
you
for
malpractice,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
and
so
long
as
there's
any
basis
for
the
suit,
they
can
do
that
in
your...
or
am
i
misstating
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
there's
always
abuse
of
process
if
there's...
but
if
there's
some
basis,
then
you
can
use
it
specifically
to
retaliate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can
specifically
use
it
to
retaliate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
we're
talking...
we're
talking
in...
in
the
labor
context.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
lose
the
suit.
so,
there's...
you
do
not...
you're
not
the
prevailing
party
in
the
suit.
and
you...
you
lose
on
the
merits.
there's
nothing
the
board
can
do
about
it
if
you've
done
it
specifically
to
retaliate
and
for
no
other
purpose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
there's
a
retaliatory
motive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is...
is
the
point
of
this
colloquy
whether
or
not
this
act
can
be
called
punitive
or
this
nlrb
doctrine
can
be
called
punitive?
i...
i
had
thought
you
said
that
it
is
punitive,
or
am
i
wrong?
maybe
you
think
nothing...
maybe
you
think
nothing
turns
on
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in...
in
a
case
like
this,
if
we
have
essentially
these
facts,
if
the
finding
of
the
board
was
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
employer
in
bringing
the
suit
was
because
the
employer's
board
of
directors
met
and
they
say,
we
are
being
hurt
in
the
marketplace,
public
opinion
is
against
us,
we
must
bring
these
suits
to
protect
our
position
in
the
business
community,
i
take
it
that
is
a
retaliatory
motive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you...
you
know
what
i'm
trying...
trying
to
get
at.
the...
the
union
is
doing
these
to
weaken
the
employer
and
the
employer
meets
and
says,
this
is
hurting
our
business,
it's
hurting
us
in
the
marketplace.
is
that
retaliatory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assume...
assume
that
there...
it's
not
baseless.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
can
be
retaliatory
for
the
employer
to
protect
its
business
against
suits
by
the
union
which
are
brought
by
the
union
for
the
motive
of
weakening
the
employer.
that's
retaliatory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
it's
been
bringing
suits
in
order
to
stop
the
other
suits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let...
let
me
ask
you
in
a
related
vein.
maybe
it's
an
unrelated
vein.
can...
could
congress
overrule
noerr-pennington?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
noerr-pennington
doesn't
have
a
constitutional
underpinning.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my...
my
concern...
my
concern
is...
is
this,
is
that
the
first
amendment
has
its
own
corrective
counterspeech,
but
what
the
board
has
done
here
is
it's
defined
retaliatory
motive
so
broadly
that
it's
taken
away
that
first
amendment
corrective.
and
that
is
itself
a
distortion
of
first
amendment
principles
which
allowed
the
unions
to
bring
these
suits
in
the
first
place,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it...
i
take
it
the
background
of
this
case
is
that
there
was
a
finding
of
retaliatory
motive
and
we
have
to
make
our
decision
based
upon
the
way
the
board
interprets
retaliatory
motive
in
cases
such
as
this.
