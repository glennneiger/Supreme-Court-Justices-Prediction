mr.
maurice
baskin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
an
important
question
arising
under
the
petition
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
petitioner
be&k
construction
is
asking
the
court
to
hold
that
the
first
amendment
protects
objectively
based
lawsuits
from
being
declared
unlawful
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
the
court
has
already
held
that
the
first
amendment
does
protect
lawsuits
from
statutory
sanction
under
both
the
nlra
and
the
antitrust
laws
so
long
as
the
suits
are
meritorious,
meaning
that
they
are
not
objectively
baseless.
in
the
bill
johnson's
case,
the
court
said...
and
i
quote...
it
is
not
unlawful
to
pursue
a
meritorious
lawsuit
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
fact,
the
court
said
it
twice
and
specifically
cited
the
noerr-pennington
doctrine
of
the
antitrust
law.
then
it--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--well,
the
test
by
the
board
is
one
which
says
that
the
employer
must
be...
must
prevail,
must
be
100
percent
prevailing
in
the
lawsuit.
as
a
standard
that's
impossible
for
any
employer
to
anticipate
in
advance.
no...
no
employer
can
ever
be
100
percent
sure
of
prevailing.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
the
question
is
what
was--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--the
test
is
what
is
the...
was
there
an
objective
basis
for
the
litigation.
it's
not
a
win-or-lose
test,
as
the
court
said
in
professional
real
estate...
and
i'll
quote
again...
it's
got
to
be
objectively
baseless
in
the
sense
that
no
reasonable
litigant
could
realistically
expect
success
on
the
merits.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
in
this
case,
your
honor,
an
answer
is
yes
because
the
court
itself
has
interacted
with
the...
both
of
the
acts.
they
cross
reference
with
each
other.
bill
johnson's
referred
directly
to
the
california
motor
transport.
professional
real
estate
referred
to
bill
johnson's
as
if
it's
one
consistent
whole.
and
it
is.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
but
the
irony
here
is
that
the
nlrb
has
not...
has
not
interpreted
its
own
statute.
it's
not
being
deferred
to
here.
the
nlrb
is
interpreting
this
court's
decision
in
bill
johnson's.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
no,
your
honor.
in
bill--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--three--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--yes.
three
things
in
the
phrasing
that
you
just
said.
first,
the
court
said
the
board
may
proceed,
did
not
say
it's
an
automatic
result.
said
may
adjudicate
the
unfair
labor
practice,
did
not
say
it's
an
automatic
result.
and
then
key
phrase,
having
proved
to
be
unmeritorious,
what
does
unmeritorious
mean?
well,
this
court
has
consistently
said
what
unmeritorious
means.
it
said
so
before
bill
johnson's
in
the
christiansburg
case.
mr.
maurice
baskin
yes.
mr.
maurice
baskin
yes.
mr.
maurice
baskin
yes,
and
if
it
were
the
holding
of
the
opinion,
it
would
have
greater
weight.
but
this
is
not
the
holding
that
we're
talking...
that
we're
parsing
out
here.
this
is
dicta
because
the
essential--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--it
is
clearly
dicta
because
the
court
stated
what
was
the
issue
before
it,
and
the
sole
issue
before
it
in
bill
johnson's
is
stated
at
the
beginning
of
the
opinion,
whether
the
nlrb
may
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order
to
halt
the
prosecution
of
a
state
court
civil
suit
brought
by
an
employer
to
retaliate
against
employees.
and
the
holding
of
the
case,
which
analyzes
the
first
amendment
at
great
length,
says
that
the
right
of
access
to
the
courts
is
too
important
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
it
also
defines
meritorious
as
being
reasonable
basis,
language
in
the
court's
opinion.
mr.
maurice
baskin
yes.
mr.
maurice
baskin
yes.
both
elements
must
be
present.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
it's--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--yes.
it's
very...
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
improper
motivation
purpose
test
that
was
in
the
professional
real
estate
case,
which
also
has
the
two-part
test.
you
look
at
the
objective
basis
first,
and
then
and
only
then
if
there's
no
objective
basis,
you
look
at
whether
there
was
a
retaliatory
motive.
and
how
that's
defined,
although
the
court
did
not
grant
cert
on
that
issue,
we
contested
vigorously
the...
the
board's
finding
of
retaliatory
motivation
here...
because
in
fact
the
board
has
made
it
a
rubber
stamp.
it's
become
automatic
if
the
case
relates
in
any
way
to
union
activity,
the
board
finds
that
it's
retaliatory
motivation.
but
the
first
part
of
the
test
is
an
objective
one
that
the
court
has
spelled
out
both
in
bill
johnson's
itself
and
in
professional
real
estate.
and
to
take
any...
to
take
the
board's
standard
puts
employers
in
an
impossible
situation.
it
is
unworkable.
going
back
to
the
question
of
dicta
or
not,
you
have
ambiguous
language
at
best
because
we
have
several
different
references
to
meritorious
throughout
the
bill
johnson's
opinion.
mr.
maurice
baskin
it's
one
mostly
as
to
timing
and
facts
available
to
the
board,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
was--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--the
substantive
standard
should
be
the
same.
mr.
maurice
baskin
should
be.
mr.
maurice
baskin
we're
all
here
today
because
the
language
in
the
tail
end
of
the
bill
johnson's
opinion
is
ambiguous
as
to
what
they
intended
the
standard
to
be.
mr.
maurice
baskin
as
to...
the...
the
impact
was--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--correct.
mr.
maurice
baskin
that
really
is
the
whole
key
to
the
case.
mr.
maurice
baskin
no.
we
are
not
saying
that.
we
are
not
seeking
to
constitutionally...
we
are
asking
no
more
than
that
you
apply
this
standard
to
the
two
statutes
you've
already
applied
it--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--no.
it
is
a
constitutional
and
statutory
argument,
which
is
what
the
court
itself
said
in
both
of
these
cases
because
there's
a
sanction
involved.
mr.
maurice
baskin
it
prohibits
a
statute
from
prohibiting
it.
mr.
maurice
baskin
constitutional
and
statutory.
mr.
maurice
baskin
no.
the
difference...
here's
the
important
difference.
mr.
maurice
baskin
but
is
there
an...
a
declaration
of
unlawfulness
involved?
there
are
many
fee-shifting
statutes.
we're
not
taking
issue
with
mere
fee-shifting,
but
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
saying
that
be&k
broke
the
law,
and
that's
what
also
happened
under
the
antitrust
laws.
they're
saying...
they're
issuing
a
cease
and
desist
order
from
filing
so-called
nonmeritorious
litigation.
mr.
maurice
baskin
first,
the
most
important
is
the
declaration
that
you
are
a
law
violator
in
and
of
itself.
you
have
to
post
a
notice
for
your
employees
not
only
at
this
job
site
but
all
across
the
country.
you
have
your...
your
customers
become
aware
of
it.
the
unions
certainly
make
sure
your
customers
become
aware
of
it.
there's
the
serious
danger
of
debarment
either
privately
or
by
governmental
action.
mr.
maurice
baskin
it's
not
meant
in
the
legal
sense
and
the
government...
we're
not...
we're
not
talking
about
whether
the
government
has
to
debar
the
company,
but
both
private
actors
and
many
government
contracting
officers
take
the
view
they
don't
want
to
deal
with
people
who
have
been
declared
to
be
law
violators.
the
goodwill
and
reputation
of
the
company
is
at
stake.
mr.
maurice
baskin
yes,
they
did.
and
then
the
federal
government
just
last...
2
years
ago
in
the
previous
administration,
had
come
through
with
a
set
of
rules
saying
that
companies
would
be
debarred
if
they
were
found
to
have
violated
labor
laws.
so,
having
this...
a
declaration
of
illegality
in
place
is
what
makes
this
different,
justice
scalia,
from
a
random
fee-shifting
statute,
and
that's
why
we
are
not
asking
you
to
do
anything
other
than
what
you've
already
done,
which
is
to
apply
the
first
amendment
to
two
statutes
which
you
have
determined
have
great
commonality
over
the
years,
as
each
one
keeps
referring
back
to
the
other
in
this
doctrine.
mr.
maurice
baskin
i
regret
to
say
it's
a
tribute
to
the
speed
of
the
board's
processes
and
the
process
of
getting
this
case
up
to
this
level
on
this
issue
because
this
case
alone
has
taken
7
years
to
work
its
way
through
the
board.
when
the
litigation
was
begun
in
this
case,
it
was
1987.
the
bill
johnson's
case
was
fresh.
there
was
considerable
doubt
as
exactly...
as
to
exactly
what
it
meant.
i
should
note
that
in
the
district
court
opinions
that
are
part
of
the
appendix,
the
unions
raised
bill
johnson's
and
said
that
it...
they
were
protected
under
it,
citing
it
interchangeably
with
professional
real
estate.
mr.
maurice
baskin
excuse
me?
mr.
maurice
baskin
depending
on
how
you
count,
they
just
barely
got
over
50
percent.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
in
fact,
by
the
time
this
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
be&k
was
no
longer
doing
business
in
california.
the
gravamen
of
its
doing
business
was
in
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
maurice
baskin
and
that's
why
the
decision
was
made--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--the--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--the
irony
is
that
the
court
considered
those
purported
differences
in
the
bill
johnson's
case
and
rejected
them.
mr.
maurice
baskin
no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
the
first
part.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
to
me
it's...
the
interesting
thing
about
this
case
is
the
court
has
itself
considered
these
very
questions
that
you're
raising
and
you
have
answered
them,
and
you
do
not
need
to
revisit
them
to...
to
come
out
with
the
conclusion
that
the
nlrb
has
either
misinterpreted
the
standard
or
that
the
standard
is
unworkable.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
only
in
one
respect.
it
has
to
have
an
objective
basis.
we
are
not
here
defending
sham
litigation,
baseless
litigation.
mr.
maurice
baskin
more
than
some.
it
must
be
reasonable
basis.
and
yes,
yes.
mr.
maurice
baskin
the
court...
this
court
has
said
that
if
there
is
an
objective
basis,
that
means
it's
a
meritorious
lawsuit.
then
there
may
also
be
a
motivation
of
retaliation.
weighty,
countervailing
considerations.
mr.
maurice
baskin
yes.
mr.
maurice
baskin
if
it
is
a
reasonable,
meritorious
suit,
as
this
court
has
defined
it,
where
the
right
of
access
to
a
court
is
too
important
to
be
called
an
unfair
labor
practice
solely
on
the
ground
that
what
is
sought
in
the
court
is
to
enjoin
employees
from
exercising
a
protected
right
because
of
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution,
the
right
to
petition
the
courts
with
a
meritorious
lawsuit.
mr.
maurice
baskin
no,
your
honor,
because...
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
court
held
in
professional
real
estate.
the
employer
has
the
right
not
to
be
second
guessed
with
20/20
hindsight
as
long
as
it
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
suit.
mr.
maurice
baskin
because
the
employers
are
being
chilled
and,
in
effect,
the
retaliation--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--but
there's
actually
less
retaliation
that's
going
to
take
place
once
the
suit
is
completed.
if
that
were
the
standard,
then
the
board
should
be
instructed
to
intervene
sooner
to
keep
the
employees
from
having
to
spend
more
money
to
defend
themselves.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
here
there's
even
a
more
compelling
interest.
you
have
two
statutes,
federal
statutes,
that
the
employer
was
invited
to
file
lawsuits
under.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
the
ambiguity
was
in
the
opinion
that
led
the
board
to
take
an
erroneous
view--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--well,
a
settled
body
of
erroneous
law.
and
is
that
what
the
court--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--well,
first,
the
court
has
said
you
don't
defer...
that...
that
you
can't
read
anything
into
congressional
inaction,
particularly
when
it
has
taken
this
long
before
the
board
ruling
really
was
definitive.
and
it
has
taken
that
long.
the
issue
has
been
in
doubt
for
most
of
that
20-year
period.
but
the...
going
beyond
that,
the...
the
board--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--because
it's
been
in
doubt.
cases
like
this
one
have
been
taking
a
long
time
to
wind
their
way
through
the
process.
at
each
step,
the
board
said,
well,
we
think
that
it...
there...
it
was
contested,
as
the
board
said--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--yes.
mr.
maurice
baskin
absolutely.
mr.
maurice
baskin
there
have
been
dissents,
but
no,
the
board
has
generally
taken
a
consistent
view.
mr.
maurice
baskin
yes,
but
the
board--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--but
the
board
is
not
entitled
to
deference
in
its
interpretation
of
the
u.s.
constitution
or
of
this
court's
decision.
and
that's
all
that
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
constitution
and
this
court's
opinion.
it's
not
interpreting
the
statute.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
it
is...
stare
decisis
is
a
form
of
deference,
and
we're
talking
about
stare
decisis
would
apply
to
the
court's
own
opinion.
only
this
court
is
required
to
defer
to
itself
about
its
own
opinion.
your...
and
so
that's
why
we
are
talking
about
deference,
i
would
submit.
at
least
i
interpret
your
question
as
asking
should
you
stick
with
what
the
board
has
come
up
with.
this
court
has
not
ruled
on--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--on
bill
johnson's
since
bill
johnson's.
mr.
maurice
baskin
i
contest
that
it's
a
settled
statutory
regime,
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
first
amendment
right,
and
that
the
board's
outcome,
which
it
has
taken
this
long
to
reach
back
to
the
court,
is
wrong
under
the
first
amendment.
it
has
proved
to
be
unworkable
and
it
subjects
employers
to
the
impossible
situation
in
future
cases
and
in
cases
going
on
right
now
that
they
are
expected
to
have
100
percent
certainty
of
the
outcome.
indeed,
the...
the
board
could,
under
this
standard,
say
that
you
can
win
a
jury
verdict,
go...
have
it
upheld
by
the
district
court,
only
to
be
reversed
by
an
appeals
court,
and
still
be
found
under
this
court's
standard
to
be
nonmeritorious
and
you
lose.
you
have...
you
have
violated
the
law.
mr.
maurice
baskin
if
there's
a
retaliatory
motive.
and
that's
all
it
takes.
there's
a
retaliatory
motive.
you
go
through
all
of
that
based
on
an
attack
on
your
businesses,
which
is
why
employers
tend
to
file
these
lawsuits.
they
don't
like
lawyers
that
much,
don't
want
to
spend
the
money
to
do
it,
but
they're
under
attack.
be&k
was
under
attack
in
every
conceivable
forum.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--well,
no,
it's
the
board
that's
carving
out
an
exception
from
the
basic
first
amendment
protection
that
this
court
has
recognized
already.
mr.
maurice
baskin
there...
there
can
be
a
difference,
mainly
the
difference
of
having
more
facts,
having
an
outcome
in
front
of
the
board
at
that
point.
and
what
the
court
wanted
to
get
across...
the
issue
in
front
of
the
court
in
bill
johnson's
was
don't
interfere
with
an
ongoing
lawsuit.
we
don't
know
how
it's
going
to
turn
out.
all
right.
once
it
turns
out,
if
it's
without
merit...
meritorious...
i'd
just
invite
the
court
to
look
at
each
use
of
the
word
meritorious
in
the
bill
johnson's
opinion.
you
will
regrettably
find
some
inconsistencies
not
only
internally
but
with
other
opinions
of
this
court
both
before
bill
johnson's
and
after.
you
have
the
opportunity
to
clarify
the
law
now
in
a
way
that
is
very
straightforward
under
the
professional
real
estate
investors
test.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
maurice
baskin
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
just
briefly
like
to
address
the
question
of
retaliatory
motive,
but
only
as
i
understood
the
justices'
questions
to
be
does
it
suffice
alone
so
that
they...
the
board
can
rightly
ignore
the
question
of
the
objective
basis.
and...
and
the
reason
it
does
not
suffice,
among
others,
is
perhaps
looking
at
the
26
decisions
justice
scalia
found,
there's
only
one
among
them
where
there
was
no
finding
of
retaliatory
motive
and
there
only
because
it
was
found
that
the
action
didn't
relate
in
any
way
to
the
union
activity.
mr.
maurice
baskin
where
there
was
no
finding,
where
the
board
found
no
retaliatory
motive.
it
found
against
the
employers
25
out
of
26
times.
once
it
found
that
the
employer
had
lost
the
lawsuit,
automatically
according
to
the
board,
no
merit.
even
though
they
had
all
the
best
circumstances
leading
up
to
the
loss,
they
lost.
no
merit.
then
the
board
proceeds
to
the
retaliatory
motive
step
supposedly
going
to
protect
employers,
and
all
they
say
is
does
it
relate
to
union
activity.
well,
if
it
relates,
except
for
one
case
where
it
didn't,
boom,
you
lose.
the
employers
lose.
and
what
the
result
of
that
is,
is
that
no
employer
can
go
to
court
if
any
sort
of
protected
activity
is
even
arguably
involved
because
even
if
you
convene
a
panel
of
experts,
as
be&k
did
in
this
case,
and
go
as
far
as
you
can
to
make
sure
you
are
not
trampling
on
any
employee
rights,
if
you
go
to
court,
you
will
be
found
to
have
violated
the
law
unless
you
can
say
with
100
percent
certainty
that
you're
going
to
win.
and
no
one
can
say
that.
mr.
maurice
baskin
no.
26
cases
with
attorney's
fees
plus,
attorney's
fees--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--yes.
the
board
found
retaliatory
motive.
mr.
maurice
baskin
in
the
26
cases--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--no.
as
i
understood
justice
scalia,
and
frankly
our
own
research,
is
these
are
26
cases
that
reached
the
board
where
the
board
could
have
gone
either
way,
and
every
time,
except
for
the
one,
they
found
no
merit
and
retaliatory
motive.
and
they
did
so
almost
automatically
because
of
their
misreading
of
a
principle.
we
say
a
misreading.
but
either
way,
it's
a
bad
principle.
mr.
maurice
baskin
the
26
cases
are--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--yes,
that's...
that's
what
we
know.
they
found
retaliatory
motive.
and
the
limited
point
that
i'm
making
here
at
the
end
is
that
this
retaliatory
motive
idea
is
no
more...
not
enough
protection
under
the
nlra
just
as
it
is
not
enough
protection...
and
you've
already
found
it
to
be
not
enough
protection...
under
the
antitrust
laws.
and
that's
why
the
professional
real
estate
standard
is
the
correct
standard
and
it's
the
only
one
that
protects
employers'
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
thank
you.
