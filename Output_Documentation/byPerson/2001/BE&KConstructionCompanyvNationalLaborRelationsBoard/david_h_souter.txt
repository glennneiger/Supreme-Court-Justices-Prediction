justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
are
two
responses
to
the
dicta
point
it
seems
to
me.
the
first
one
is
it
was
dicta,
but
it
was
dicta
that
preceded
a
remand
in
which
this
issue
in
fact
would
be
explored.
and
the
second
response
is
the...
as
i
understand
it,
the
board
itself
has
followed
the...
the
dicta
for...
i
forget
how
many
years
now,
but
consistently
followed
it
and
congress
has
done
nothing
about
it.
so,
a,
query
whether
it's
dicta,
and
b,
even
if
it
is,
isn't
it
the
kind
of
dicta
that
at
this
point
definitely
should
be
followed?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that
ignores
the
fact
that
we're
not
concerned
solely
with
chilling;
we're
also
concerned
with
retaliation.
and
if
we
didn't
have
the
retaliatory
character
of
the
lawsuit
involved,
i
would
think
you
would
have
a
much
stronger
argument
as
you
just
made
it.
but
the
retaliation
is
there
and
i
don't
see
how
we
can
accept
your...
in
effect,
your
chilling
argument
without
ignoring
the
retaliatory
character.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they're
being
chilled
in...
in
engaging
in
retaliation
for
the
exercise
of
statutory
rights.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the...
the
answer
to
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
set
out
in
the
cases.
we've
got
a...
we've
got
a
federalism
interest
in
letting
the
state
courts
at
least
adjudicate
their
cases.
so,
that's
the
answer
to
that
objection.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let's
go
back
then
to
the...
to
the
difference
between
the
two
federal
statutes.
the
premise
of
justice
breyer's
question
a
moment
ago
accepted
the
ambiguity.
if
we
are
not
that
indulgent
and
if
we
read
bill
johnson's
the
way
justice
ginsburg
read
it...
and
i
will
be
candid
to
say
i
read
it...
number
one,
the
ambiguity
does
not
leap
out
at
us.
and
number
two,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
even
if
we
assume
there
was
ambiguity
at
the
beginning,
we
have
had
20
years
of
board
practice
which
seems
to
me
to
have
dissipated
any
ambiguity.
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right
i
believe,
and
the
board
has
made
it
very
clear
how
the
board
is
reading
it,
and
after
20
years,
we've
got
a
pretty
clearly
settled
body
of
law,
haven't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
we're
interpreting
statutes...
the...
the
settled
body
is
clear
and
congress
is
apparently
quite
agreeable
to
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
has
the
board
ever
taken
a
different
position
in
the
20-year
period?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
the
board's
position
has
been
clear
for
20
years.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
board
is
slow.
it
may
take
the...
the
cases
may
be
in
wending
their
way
through.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
we're
not
raising...
i
think
justice
ginsburg's
question
and
my
question
is
not
so
much
geared
to
an
issue
of
deference.
we're...
we're
trying
to...
to
get
at
the...
what
seems
to
us
the
fact
that
the
law
has
become
settled.
it
may
require
no
deference.
it
may
have
become
settled
because
an
administrative
agency
was
interpreting
what
you
think
was
an
ambiguous
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
first
place.
but
it
seems
to
have
become
settled.
and
there
is
a
good
reason,
which
underlies
ultimately
our...
our
approach
to
stare
decisis
in
statutory
cases,
for
letting
settled
statutory
understandings
stayed
settled
unless
the
legislative
branch
wants
to
change
them.
and
that's
the
argument
we're
getting
at,
not
deference.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
saying
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
saying
that
in...
as...
as
your
own
answers
indicate,
for
20
years
there
seems
to
have
been
a...
a
settled
practice
on
the
part
of
the
board
which
at
best
is
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
why
shouldn't
we
let
a
settled
statutory
regime
stay
settled
unless
the
legislative
branch
wants
to
change
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
you
say
the
board
could
have
gone
either
way,
you
don't
mean
that
you
know
the
evidence
and
that,
in
fact,
on
the
evidence,
the
board
could
have
gone
either
way.
you
simply
mean
that
it's
a
case
in
which
if
the
evidence
showed
there
was
retaliation,
they
could
award
the
fees,
and
if
the
evidence
did
not
show
retaliation,
they
couldn't
award
the
fees.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
all
we
know
is
that
in
those
cases,
they
found
retaliatory
motive.
we
don't
know
that
they're
wrong.
