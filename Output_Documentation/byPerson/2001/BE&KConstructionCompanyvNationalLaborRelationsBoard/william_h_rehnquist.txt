01-518,
the
be&k
construction
company
v.
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
baskin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
should
the
test
from
professional
real
estate
automatically
be
carried
over
to
the
labor
relations
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i...
i
wonder
if...
if
the
national
labor
relations
board
doesn't
have
some
discretion
to
say
that
the
labor
situation
is
somewhat
different,
as
they
apparently
do,
from
the
antitrust
situation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
our
lower
case,
the...
wisconsin
set
out
to
do
that
on
a
state
basis,
didn't
it?
if
you
violated
the
labor
act,
the
state
was
not
going
to
deal
with
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
baskin.
mr.
wallace,
we'll

from
you.

h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
when
i
ask
you
a
question,
please
stop.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
listen
a
little
more
closely.
do
you
disagree
with
mr.
baskin's
contention
that
the
word
meritorious
is
used
inconsistently
in
the
part
of
bill
johnson's
that
we're
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
the
courts'...
is
the
board's
definition
of
a
unmeritorious
lawsuit
simply
one
which...
in
which
the
plaintiff
does
not
get
what
the
plaintiff
wants.
it's
thrown
out
of
court,
so
to
speak.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how...
how
would
it
vary?
why
do
you
use
the
term
approximately?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
baskin,
you
have
4
minutes
