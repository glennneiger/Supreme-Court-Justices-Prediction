justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
your
position...
your
position
would,
as
justice
breyer
suggested,
mean
that
the
soldiers
and
sailors
civil
relief
act
is
invalid,
insofar
as
it
tolls
state
statute
of
limitations
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
would...
this...
this
would
be
a
big
surprise,
i
think--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
members
of
the
armed
forces.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why...
why
do
you
want
to
go
that
far?
why
don't
you
stick
with
what
the
lower
courts
did
and
talk
about
the
eleventh
amendment?
what...
what
possible
advantage
is
it
to
you
to
make
this
sweeping
argument
you're
making?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
that
regard,
what's
the
matter
with
the
solicitor
general's
approach
that
says
the
statute
was
never
intended
to
cover
nonconsenting
states?
don't
interpret
as
applying.
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how...
how
do
you
respond
to
the
soldiers
and
sailors
civil
relief
act
as
applied
to
states
in
tolling
causes
of
action
against
the
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
the
petitioners
lance
raygor
and
james
goodchild
sued
the
university
of
minnesota
in
federal
district
court
asserting
age
discrimination
claims
under
both
state
in
federal
law.
the
claims
were
based
on
the
allegations
that
the
university
had
reclassified
their
jobs
and
reduced
their
salaries
after
the
petitioners
declined
to
accept
their
early
retirement.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
claims
on
eleventh
amendment
grounds
because
the
university
was
an
arm
of
the
state
of
minnesota.
the
petitioners
then
refiled
their
state
law
claims
in
state
court.
the
university
moved
to
dismiss
them
based
on
the
applicable
state
statute
of
limitation
which
should
have
been
run,
the
state
said.
the
petitioners
resisted
the
dismissal
based
on
a
tolling
provision
in
the
federal
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute,
and
that
provision
purports
to
toll
the
limitations
period
for
supplemental
state
law
claims
while
they
are
pending
in
a
federal
court
action,
and
for
30
days
after
dismissal
if
that
action
is
dismissed.
the
state
district
court
dismissed
the
claims,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
the
state
supreme
court
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
held
that
the
federal
tolling
provision
was
unconstitutional.
as
applied
to
claims
against
a
nonconsenting
state
defendant.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
but
on
different
grounds.
the
petitioners
sought
to
have
their
state
law
claims
heard
in
federal
court
under
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute.
the
statute
does
not
authorize
jurisdiction
in
federal
court
for
state
law
claims
against
nonconseting
state
defendant,
because
that
would
abrogate
states'
sovereign
immunity.
the
federal
statutes
general
granted
jurisdiction
contains
no
clear
statement
of
an
intent
to
abrogate
states'
sovereign
immunity.
in
these
circumstances
the
question
before
us
is
whether
the
federal
statute
tolling
provision
should
be
read
to
apply
when
those
claims
are
dismissed
and
refiled
in
the
state
court,
and
we
have
recognized
that
a
state
of
course,
in
the
first
instance,
can
prescribe
the
terms
and
conditions
on
which
it
consents
to
be
sued
on
its
own
state
courts.
we
relied
on
a
clear
statement
rule
of
statutory
construction,
and
that
requires
congress
to
make
its
intention
clear
when
it
alters
the
constitutional
balance
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
we
do
not
reach
the
constitutional
claims
here
because
we
read
the
statute
as
not
being
applicable
in
this
circumstances,
and
because
we
think
the
tolling
provision
properly
construed
does
not
apply
to
petitioners
claims
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
dismissing
them.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
souter
and
breyer
have
joined.
