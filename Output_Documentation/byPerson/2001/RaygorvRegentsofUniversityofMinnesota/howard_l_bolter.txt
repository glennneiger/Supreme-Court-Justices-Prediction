mr.
howard
l.
bolter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
1367
is
a
constitutional
and
sensible
response
by
congress
to
the
serious
procedural
problems
that
were
facing
the
federal
courts
prior
to
1990.
those
procedural
problems
arose
due
to
state
claims
that
were
pending
in
the
federal
courts
at
that
time
under
this
court's,
what
was
then
called,
pendent
jurisdiction
and
is
now
called
supplemental
jurisdiction.
the
problem
specifically
was
what
happens
to
those
state
claims
that
are
pending
in
federal
court
when
the
expiration
of
the
statute
of
limitations
on
those
claims
occurs.
the
courts
were
faced
with
a
dilemma
at
that
point,
do
they
dismiss
these
claims
and
risk
having
them
not
be
refiled
in
the
state
court
or
do
they
retain
those...
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
those
claims
and
decide
issues
that
might
be
better
suited
for
the
state
courts
when
they
don't...
when
the
federal
court
no
longer
wants
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
the
problem
with
that
solution,
justice
scalia,
is
that
there
is
no
guarantee
that
there
would
be
an
agreement
to
waiver.
the
defendant
is...
it's
up
to
the
defendant
to
agree
to
that
waiver
and
to
say
that
they
will...
they
will
not
bring
up
that
statute
of
limitations
defense
in
state
court.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
in
that...
in
that
situation,
it
might
work.
there
might
be
supplemental
jurisdiction
and
the
plaintiffs
will
not
lose
their
claims.
however,
that
is
just
one
court's
potential
solution.
there
were
a
number
of
solutions
that
were
being
attempted
at
the
time
with
varying
effectiveness.
it
didn't
guarantee,
across
the
board,
that
plaintiffs
would
be
able
to
bring
those
state
claims
in
federal
court
and
be
assured
that
they
would
be...
that
they
wouldn't
be
forfeited
if
the
statute
of
limitations
ran
out.
one...
one
possible
solution
to
the
problem
doesn't
make
1367
unconstitutional.
1367
was
a...
was
a
general
response
to
a
general
problem
that
was
occurring
below.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
to
do
that,
the
court
needs
to
address
the
threshold
question
of
whether
the
statute
abrogates
in...
in
the
first
place,
whether
tolling
is
an
abrogation
of
the
state's
immunity,
and
we
contend
that
it
is
not.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
if
the...
if
that
scenario
was
taken
and...
and
the
construction
is...
is
construed
not
to
apply
to
the
states,
there
will
be
serious
constitutional
problems
that
will
be
created
by
that
construction,
particularly
depriving
the...
the
federal
litigants
of
their
access
to
the
federal
forum.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
the
right...
the
due
process
rights
of
a
plaintiff
to
have
their
cause
of
action
heard
in
a...
in
a
certain
forum,
to
make
sure
that
they
would
have
those
claims
heard.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
i
don't
know
if
there's
a
case
that's...
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
take
that...
that's
the
logan
case
that...
that
shows
that
a...
that
a
plaintiff
has
a
right
to
have
their...
their
cause
of
action
heard.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
that...
that's
correct,
not
to
have...
not
to
have
it
heard
in...
in
the
federal
court
against
the
state,
but
to
have
it
heard
in
some
forum.
the
way--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--that's...
that's
right.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
due
process
violation
would
be
if
you
construe
the
statute
not
to
apply
to
the
states,
you
don't
have
the
protection
of
tolling
a
state
claim
against
a
state
in
federal
court.
and
if
a
state
asserts
its
constitutional
defense
of
sovereign
immunity,
that
claim
could
be
barred,
but
be...
in--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--we...
we
could
have
filed
a
protective
action,
but
the...
that
has...
i
think
there
are
two
parts
to
that...
that
answer.
first,
we
could
have
filed
a
protective
action,
but
there's
no
guarantees
that
the
state
would
have
stayed
that
action.
it
might
have...
it
might
have
forced
litigation
on
that
matter,
creating
res
judicata
and
claims
preclusion
issues
in
the
federal
court.
it
might
have
sought
to
dismiss
it
because
of
claims
splitting.
and
the
next
part
of
the
question
is
that
the...
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
said
that
this
was
a
facially
unconstitutional...
section
1367--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--they...
they
could
do
that,
but
the
point
is
that
it
wasn't...
there
was
no
guarantee
that
they
will.
they
might
also
choose
not
to
stay
it
and
not
to
clog
up
their
dockets
and
have...
have
cases
affecting
their
statistics.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
they...
if
the
claim
is
filed
in
minnesota
on...
they
will
not
dismiss
if
it
was
clear
that
the
federal
court
would
not
have
exercised
jurisdiction
over
that
federal...
over
that
state
claim.
and
in
minnesota,
it
was
not
clear
at
that
time,
and
it's
still
not
clear
because
the...
the
university
and
the
states
have
this
constitutional
defense
which
they
can
assert
or
not
assert.
it's
at
their
discretion.
in
fact,
some
of
the
cases
that
we've
cited
show
that
minnesota,
the
university,
has
litigated
cases,
on
the
merits
in
federal
court,
state
and
federal
claims.
so,
the
point
there
is
that
we
didn't
know
that
the
court
would
not
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
state
claims,
and
if
we
were
to
file
with
that
knowledge
in...
in
state
court,
they
could
have
dismissed
on
claims
splitting
or
claim
preclusion
ground...
or
claims
splitting
grounds
because
the
federal
court
might
have
exercised
jurisdiction.
it
was
not
clear.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
no,
that's
not
what
we
are
saying.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
the...
the
scenario
that
you
just
posed
about
the
6-month
and
the
1-year
time
limits...
you
could
still
file
that
state
claim
in
federal
court
within
6
months.
you
have
to
comply
with
the...
the
state
cause...
the
state
statute
of
limitations.
it's
just
in
a
forum
that
maybe
the
state
will
ultimately
object
to.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
i
think
in
your...
in
that
hypothetical,
it
probably
would
impede,
but
that's
not
the
situation
that
we
have
in
front
of
us.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
what
the...
what
the
statute
does
here,
if
it's
applied
to
a
state,
is
it
tolls
the
time
limit.
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
change
the
time
limit
for
the...
the
statute
of
limitations.
if
we
were
to
file
this
claim
on
the
50th
day,
1367(d)
wouldn't
apply.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
it
gives
you
the...
the
tolling...
the
tolling
provision
runs
for
30
days
after
the
time
after
the
dismissal.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
well,
it
gives
a
longer
tolling--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--i
would
respectfully
disagree
that
it
reconfigures
the...
the
statute
of
limitations
because
it's...
the
statute...
the
state
statute
has
to
be
complied
with
in
order
for
1367
to...
to
be
triggered.
it
has
to
be
filed
within
the
appropriate
time
period.
and...
and
that
meets
the
statute
of
limitations
objectives
that
the
state
was
seeking
when
it...
when
it
created
that
45-day
period.
the
fact
that
it's
being
tolled
after
it's
been
timely
filed
is
not...
that's...
that's
not
a
core
interest
that's
protected
by
the
state
sovereign
immunity.
tolling
a
statute
that
has
been
complied
with,
in
this
case
filing
within
that
45
days--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--well,
the...
the
state
statute
is
silent
on
tolling.
it's
not
a
condition
of...
of
the
state's
waiver
of
that
45-day
period
and--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--that's
what...
they
found
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion,
but
that
was...
that...
the
state
court's
initial
decision
there
was
based
on
a...
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
pennhurst
ii
when--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--they
have
the
discretion
to
decide
that,
but
it's
our
position
that
the
tolling
provision
of
1367(d)
can
also
toll
that
time
period
because
it's
not
abrogating
the
state's
sovereign
immunity.
it's
not--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--but
it
doesn't
defeat
the
purpose
of...
of
the
statute
of
limitations
and...
and
the
need
to
file
in
a
timely
fashion
with
that
state
statute
to
begin
with.
and
i
think
that's
what
the...
the
state...
the...
if
the
state
has
a
core
interest
in
the
statute
of
limitations,
that's
what
it
would
be,
is
that
claims
are
filed
within
that
time
period.
now,
whether
it's
filed
in
a...
in
a
jurisdiction
to
which
the
state
ultimately
objects
is...
is
another
point.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
article
iii
to
control
the
lower
federal

gives
the...
the
government
the
power
to
create
these...
these
federal
practices
and

in
this
case,
the...
the
way
to
address
combined
federal
and
state
claims,
as
well
as
its...
its...
the
powers
to
protect
individuals
from
losing
their
due
process
rights
to

and
burdening

to
the
federal

mr.
howard

bolter
yes,
article
iii
and...
and
partly
on
the
equal...
equal
protection
for...
to
allow
plaintiffs
to
have
access
to
federal
courts
and
bring
their
federal
claims
and
their
state
claims
if
they...
if
they
need
to
do
that
as
well.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
in
some
circumstances,
they
were
because
of
the
claims...
the
combination
of
the
claims
splitting
and
claims
preclusion
laws
in
the
state
courts
and
states
and
the
statute
of
limitations
on
those
pendent
claims
if
they
were
brought
in
federal
court
could
result
in
a
denial
of
a
forum
for
that
state
claim
if...
if
a
federal
claim
was
also
asserted.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
i
don't
think
it's...
that
it's
explicit
in
the
congressional--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--i
think
it's
implicit
in
there
that
they're--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--well,
the
protections
that
it...
that
it
provides--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--i...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
aside
from
nothing
explicit,
i
don't...
i
don't
know
what
congress
was
thinking
other
than
what
i
could
speculate.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
yes,
it
did
come
out
of
the
federal
courts
study
committee?
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
that's
right.
i
think
that
goes
to
the
article
iii,
i
guess
i...
if
i'm
not...
if
i'm
misunderstanding
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
i
have
to
think
about
that
for
just
a
second.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
that...
i
think
that
is
an
example.
i
think
probably
nash
is
also
an
example.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
i'm
not
sure,
justice
kennedy,
if
it
was
or
not.
i
think
nash,
though,
was
also...
i
think
nash
gets
to
your
question
as
well.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
the
nash...
the
nash--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--nash
v.
florida
industrial
commission.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
i...
i
couldn't
hear
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
that
case
also
talks
about
burdening
the
federal
rights
in
an
nlrb
case.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
in
that
situation
with...
with
two
states,
i
would
say
that
unless
it
was
within
the
time
period
of
california,
it
would
probably
not
be
tolled
in
that
situation.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
well,
we
have
a
filing
in
federal
court
here
with...
with
a
statute
that...
that
directly
addresses
the
tolling--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--well,
i
think
that
the
tolling
provision
is
different.
i
mean,
it
does
give
additional
time,
but
it
doesn't
extend
the
time
period
that
the
state
was
open
and
exposed
to
liability.
it
doesn't
extend
that
45-day
period.
they
were
already
notified
of
it.
they...
they
were
put
on
notice.
they
had
the...
they
knew
that
they
were
going
to
be
sued
and
it
was
brought
in...
within
that
45-day
period.
the
fact
that
it
was
suspended
during
a
time
period
where
the
state
was
in
federal
court
at
its
own...
its
own
discretion,
it
would
be...
it
would
be
harmful
to
the
plaintiffs
to
have
the
state
be
able
to
use
the
delay
in
time
that
it's
pending
in
federal
court
to
bar
the
claim
from
being
brought
after
that
in
state
court.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
they
didn't
make,
as
a
part
of
that
condition,
anything
about
tolling.
that's...
that's
i
think
the...
the
first
point,
and...
and
that's
what
this
statute
is
doing,
is
tolling.
it's
not
changing
that...
that
right,
that
built-in
right
that
you
talk
about,
to
the
45-day
period.
that...
that
still
has
to
be
complied
with.
but
this
is
talking
about
tolling,
which
is
a
different...
it's
a
different
animal
here,
but
it
doesn't
extend
that
time
limit,
that...
that
built-in
time
limit
simply
by
tolling.
it
suspends
it
from
running
out
but
it
doesn't
extend
it.
i
couldn't
have
filed
that
claim
75
days
after
it
was
sued.
i
had
to
file
it
within
45
days
or
else
it
would
have
been
barred,
and
1367
would
not
have
attached.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
yes.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
well,
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--well,
i
don't
think
that
it
washes--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--i
don't
know
that
i
understand.
are
you
saying
that
they
had
power
under
the
commerce...
if
they
had
power
under
the
commerce
clause,
could
they
do
this?
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
well,
i
guess
i
don't
disagree
that
it's
not
unreasonable
to
toll
this...
these
statutes
of
limitations.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
i'm
not
aware
of
a
case
like
that,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
yes,
and...
and
that's
what
we
have
done
in
this
case,
or
that's
what
we...
that's
what
this...
and
that's
what
this
statute
protects
against,
losing
those
claims.
i...
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understood
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
about
can
you
do
that
in
federal
court,
i
mean,
latch
onto
those
federal
claims?
yes.
i
mean,
that...
that
is
what
supplemental
jurisdiction
is
about
in
this
situation.
so,
i
don't
think
that
that's...
that's
appropriate
to
do
that.
and...
and
it
goes
back
to
giving
the
state
a
choice
of
whether
it
wants
to
be
there
or
not
by
exercising
its
constitutional
defense
of
sovereign
immunity.
i
mean,
i
think
the
key...
one
of
the
key
things
here
is
that
this...
that
the
tolling
does
not
abrogate
the
state's
sovereign
immunity
because
it's
in
a
jurisdiction
that
it
wants
to
be
in
at
all
times.
the
choice
is
its
own.
and
the
sovereign
immunity
core
principles
described
by
this
court
in
its
jurisprudence
have
been
whether
and
where
a
state
can
be
sued,
and
it
doesn't
infringe
on
those
core
interests.
tolling
has
never
been
identified
as
a
core
interest
of...
of
sovereign--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--i
don't--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--no.
i
think
that
the...
that
1
year
has
to
be
respected,
but
this
is
about
tolling.
it's
not
about
changing
a
statute
of
limitations.
this
is
about
tolling
the
time
period
for
it
to
run
out.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
for
rebuttal.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
address
something
that
was
brought
up
on...
again
in
questioning
the
university
about
being
a
nonconsenting
state.
it
is...
their
arguments...
the...
the
university
and
the
solicitor
general's
arguments
rely
on
the
fact
that
they
were
a
nonconsenting
state
throughout
this
whole
procedure.
and
that's
not
an
accurate
characterization
of
what
went
on
here.
when
they
were
sued
in
federal
court,
they
were
not
a
nonconsenting
state
until
9
months
later
when
they
brought
that
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
they
did
do
that.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
they--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--raising
the
defense
in
the
answer
was
just
like
raising
any
other
defense
in
that
answer.
they
had
to
assert
it
or
else
they
would
risk
a
waiver
argument
later
on.
all
that
did
was
preserve
their
right
to
bring
the...
the
motion
9
months
later.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
well,
they
were
not
a
nonconsenting
state.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
yes,
they
had
not
filed
the
motion
and
until
that
motion
was
filed,
the
court
can't
rule
on
it.
the
court
can't...
is
not
going
to
dismiss
the
claim,
and
there
will
be
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
all
the
claims
that
are--
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
--all
we
knew
by
the
answer
is
that
they
were
asserting
an
affirmative
defense,
just
like
they
asserted
a
statute
of
limitations
defense
or
laches
or
waiver.
and
none
of
those
can
be
ruled
upon
by
the
court
until
they
are
affirmatively
brought
before
them
to
rule
on.
they
might
have
just
decided
not
to
do
anything
with
it
until
the
matter
was
tried
on
its
merits,
and
they
have
done
that
in
another
case,
the
eldeeb
case,
which
they
received
summary
judgment
on
the
merits
of
both
state
and
federal
claims.
mr.
howard
l.
bolter
we
did
not
anticipate
that
that
could
be
a
construction
of...
of
1367...
of
1367(d),
otherwise
we
might
have
reevaluated
whether
or
not
to
bring
it.
but
that
wasn't...
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
that
that
was
the
status
of
the
case
law--
