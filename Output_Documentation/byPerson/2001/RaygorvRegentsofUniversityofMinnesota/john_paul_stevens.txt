justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
sort
of
preliminary
question
i'm
kind
of
puzzled
about?
what
is
the
source
of
the
federal
government's
power
to
enact
the
statute
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
it's
article
iii
you
rely
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question
as
a
preliminary
matter?
putting
the
eleventh
amendment
to...
to
one
side
just
for
a
moment,
because
i
do
understand
your
position
there,
assume
this
was
a
suit
against
a
public
utility
and
the...
and
they...
minnesota
provided
an
especially
short
statute
of
limitations
for
that
public
utility.
would...
would
you
think
the...
the
federal
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
in
such
a
case,
or
would
it
be
valid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
case
upholding
it,
no
case
striking
it
down.
but...
but
in
any
event,
you
think
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
even
if
you
didn't
have
a
state
defendant.
