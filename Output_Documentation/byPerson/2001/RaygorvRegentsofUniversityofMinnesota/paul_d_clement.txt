mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
this
court
confronts
a
general
grant
of
jurisdiction,
like
1367(a),
it
routinely
infers
that
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
nonconsenting
states.
such
a
construction
avoids
difficult...
upsetting
the
balance
between
federal
and
state
powers.
for
similar
reasons,
this
court
should
construe
section
1367(d)'s
tolling
provision
not
to
apply
to
nonconsenting
states.
that
reading
avoids
the
difficult
sovereign
immunity
questions
posed
by
the
application
of
a
federal
statute
to
extend
the
state
statute
of
limitations
against
a
nonconsenting
state
in
state
court.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
nub
of
the
point--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--is
this
court
should
apply
a
clear
statement
rule
to
this
statute,
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute,
and
since
there's
no
indication
in
the
text
or
legislative
history
that
congress
had
any
contemplation
that
this
would
apply
to
nonconsenting
states,
this
court
should
construe
the
provision
as
not
applying
to
nonconsenting
states.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there
is...
there
is
enough
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
if
the
court
wanted
to,
to
reach
the
second
argument
that
we
offer
in
our
brief,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
first
argument
we
offer
in
the
brief,
which
you
could
call
the
clear
statement
argument,
is
a
more
narrowly
tailored
and
focused
answer
to
the
constitutional
issues
that
are
raised
by
applying
the
statute
to
nonconsenting
states.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
if
i
could,
i
would
focus
on
the
clear
statement
argument
because
i
think
it
does
very
narrowly
avoid
the
constitutional
issue
that's
raised.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
this
court
only
needs
to
decide
that
it
would
raise
grave
constitutional
doubts
before
it
would
need
to
apply
the...
the
clear
statement
rule
because,
although
in
some
contexts,
in
the
abrogation
context,
for
example,
a
clear
statement
rule
assumes
that...
that
the
congress
can't
constitutionally
do
something,
in
other
contexts
as
gregory
v.
ashcroft,
will
against
the
michigan
department
of...
of
state...
in
those
cases,
this
court
has
applied
clear
statement
principles
even
though
they
don't
assume
the
answer
to
the
constitutional
question.
and
that,
of
course,
is
consistent
with
the
way
this
court
approaches
matter
as
a
general
matter
and
its
preference
to
avoid
constitutional
questions.
the...
the
court,
for
example,
just
last
term
in...
in
vermont
against
united
states
ex
rel.
stevens,
applied
similar
principles
of
statutory
construction
to
avoid
directly
addressing
the
eleventh
amendment--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think,
for
example,
in
the
stevens
case,
this
court
interpreted
the
term
person
not
to
include
the
state.
what
effectively
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
here
is
interpret
the
term,
any
claim,
in
section
1367(d)
to
say
any
claim
except
one
against
a
nonconsenting
state.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
that's
exactly
right.
and
in
will
against
michigan
where
the
court
had
already
held
that
1983
did
not
implicate
eleventh
amendment
issues,
this
court
nonetheless
held
that
in
state
courts,
the
term
person
in
1983
does
not
apply
to...
to
states
or
to
state
officers
acting
in
their
official
capacities.
and
i
think
all
of
those
cases
and
the...
the
court's
decision
in
gregory
against
ashcroft
and
in
will
all
stand
for
the
proposition
that
this
court
can
apply
a
clear
statement
type
principle
to
avoid
a
constitutional--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i...
i
think
that...
that
in
order
to
maintain
consistency
with
our
position
in
this
case,
we
would
have
to
ask
this
court
to
apply
a
clear
statement
rule
in
that
case,
and
the
current
version
of
the
statute
would
probably
not
apply
to
states
under
that...
under
that
theory.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
we
haven't
seen
that
the...
that
the
issue
of
sovereign
immunity
arising
in
those
contexts,
and
it
very
well...
well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
very
well
may
be,
as
counsel
for
the
university
of
minnesota
suggested,
that
states
will
have
the
good
sense
in
those
instances
to
waive
their
sovereign
immunity
defense.
i
mean,
the
same
principles
that
are
going
to
motivate
the
federal
government
to
pass
the
soldiers
and
sailors
civil
relief
act
are
going
to
motivate
state
governments
to
waive
their
sovereign
immunity
defenses
in
those
claims.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that...
two
points
i'd
like
to
make.
first
of
all,
it's
worth
focusing
on
the
fact
that
even
before
1367(d),
the
informal
federal
court
practices
for
dealing
with
potentially
untimely
state
claims
did
not
apply
to
nonconsenting
states.
justice
scalia,
you
raised
the...
the
problem
of
conditioning
a
dismissal
on
a
withdraw...
of
statute
of
limitations
defenses.
but,
of
course,
under
pennhurst
ii,
a
state
has
an
absolute
right
to
insist
that
the
pendent
claims
against
it
be
dismissed.
so,
in
that
context,
the
federal
court
would
not
be
able
to
condition
the
dismissal
on
a
waiver
of
a
statute
of
limitations
defense,
nor
would
it
be
able
to
retain
jurisdiction
over
the
claim.
so,
it
stands
to
reason
that
1367(d)
should
no
more
apply
to
cases
against
nonconsenting
states
than
the
federal
court
practices
it
replaced.
lastly,
i
would
emphasize
that
this
interpretation
of
section
1367(d)
does
not
place
plaintiffs
in
an
untenable
position
or
in
an
unconstitutional
bind.
plaintiffs,
in
cases
where
the
state
objects
to
federal
court
jurisdiction
as
a
blanket
matter,
have
the
same
rights
that
they
would
have
under
pennhurst
ii.
they
can
file
both
claims
in
state
court,
the
federal
and
the
state,
which
seems
a
complete
answer
to
any
due
process
objections,
or
they
can
file
parallel
proceedings.
even
if
the
state
makes
a
decision
whether
to
consent
on
a
case
by
cases,
as
minnesota
appears
to
do,
the
state...
the
plaintiff
can
still
attempt
to
get
consent
in
the
first
instance,
and
if
it's
not,
it
can
make
a
protective
filing
along
the
lines
that
justice
ginsburg
suggested.
in
the
end,
it
seems
that
plaintiffs
lack
any
case
law
to
support
their
due
process
arguments.
i
think
that
respondent,
in
fairness,
lacks
any
case
law
to
support
its...
its
article
i
legislative
power
argument.
there's
really
no
need
for
this
court
to
make
any
significant
case
law
in
order
to
decide
this
case
if
it
simply
applies
the
clear
statement
test
we
suggest
in
our
brief.
if
there's
no
other
questions,
i'll
submit.
