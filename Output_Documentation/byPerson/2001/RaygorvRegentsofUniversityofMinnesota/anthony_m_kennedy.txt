justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
wonder
about
that.
my
understanding
is...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
please...
that
the
federal
statute
gives
you
an
extra
30
days.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
so
if
you...
if...
if
as
in
this
case,
i
think
you
file
on
the
last
day
or
the
next-to-the-last
day
in
the
federal
court,
then
you're
given
an
extra
30
days.
so,
you
do
reconfigure
the
state
statute,
contrary
to
your
suggestion.
and...
and
i
have
a
significant
problem
with
that.
it
might
be
that
the
tolling
provision
is
necessary
in
order
to
make
the
federal
courts
operate
and
exercise
their
jurisdiction
in
an
efficient
manner,
but
this
statute
goes
beyond
that
and
gives
a
longer
statute
of
limitations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
does
reconfigure
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
we
were
to
conclude
that
this
statute
must
rest
upon
article
iii.
we...
we
reject
your
due
process
and
equal
protection
suggestions.
what's
the
closest
case
that
you
have
where
we
have
sustained
a
power
like
this
pursuant
to
congress'
authority
to
establish
tribunals
under
article
iii?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
terrell/taro
v.
burt
construction
company
where
the
state
cannot
condition
the
filing
of
articles
of
incorporation
on
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
go
to
federal
court?
it
can't
burden
the
right
to
go
to
federal
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
although
i
think
terrell/taro
was
probably
a
commerce
clause
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which...
which
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
nash.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
going
back
to
the
statute
of
limitations
point,
i...
i
should
know
this,
but
if
i
file
a
complaint
in
the
nevada
state
courts
and
the
nevada
court
said,
this
doesn't
belong
here,
there's
no
jurisdiction,
the
cause
of
action
arose
exclusively
in
california,
and
it
dismisses,
and
you
then
file
in
california,
is
there
tolling
as
a
general
matter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
well,
that...
that
seems
to
me
very
similar
to
what
we
have
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you're...
you're...
well,
it
does
or
it
doesn't.
but
you...
you
indicated
earlier
that
the
statute
of
limitations
was
not
in
any
way
extended
because
it
was
tolled
by
the
filing.
but
it
is
extended
by
this
additional
30
days.
you
basically
have...
what
was
it?
45...
the
45
plus
30.
you
have
75
days
now,
almost
double.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
actions
against
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
would...
what
would
possibly
be
the
ground
for
distinguishing.
the
state
has
sovereign
immunity
or
it
doesn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
precisely.
they
can
waive
if
they
want
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
suppose
under
the
rule
you're
suggesting
that
we
adopt
the
state
could...
let's
assume
that
the
claim
is
filed
in
the
federal
court
on
the
fifth
day,
and
there's
40
days
more
left.
i
suppose
the
state
could
just
sit
back
and
wait
for
60
days
before
it
moves
to
dismiss
to
allow
the
claim
to
go
stale,
under
your
submission.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
not
only
is
possible.
it's
the
necessary
concomitant...
necessary
sequence
from
the
rule
you...
you
propose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
possible,
it's
necessary.
that's
your
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
the
result
you
want
us
to
adopt.
