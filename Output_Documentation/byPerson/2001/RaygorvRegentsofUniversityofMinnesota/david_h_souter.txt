justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
take
it
you're
saying
that
whether
you
regard
it
as
built
in
or
whether
you
regard
the
policy
as
simply
a
policy
of
repose,
article
iii
power
or
section
5
power
is
what
it
is,
and...
and
it
can
accomplish
what
this
statute
wants
to
accomplish.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's...
essentially
you're
going
back
to
the
eleventh
amendment.
i
mean,
your...
i
understand
your
eleventh
amendment
argument,
but
you're
trying
to
overlay
an
article
i
argument
on
that,
and
i
think
that's
where
we're
having...
having
our
difficulty.
but
as
i
understand
it,
your
ultimate
answer
to
the
difficulty
is
the
eleventh
amendment.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
war
power
is...
is
an
article
i
power.
i
mean,
a
minute
ago
i
thought
you
were
making
a...
a
flat
article
i
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
basically
you're
saying
clear
statement.
is
that...
is
that
nub
of
your
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
clear
statement
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you...
do
you
agree
that
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
statement
rule,
there
is
no
ambiguity
here
that...
that
would
open
the
door
to
our
giving
this
kind
of
a
construction?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you've
only
got
10
minutes,
and
i'll
leave
it
to
you
to
whether
you
want
to
get
into
it.
i...
i
have
trouble
with
the
ambiguity
argument.
i
understand
your
clear
statement
argument.
i
have
trouble
with
the
ambiguity.
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
in
preserving
that
right,
it...
it
certainly
does
not
put
them
in
the
position
of
being
a
consenting
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
look,
what
it
boils
down
to
is
they
hadn't
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss
yet.
that's
what
we're
arguing
about,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
by
the
same
token,
you
know
by
the
answer
that
they
are
not
consenting
to
jurisdiction.
