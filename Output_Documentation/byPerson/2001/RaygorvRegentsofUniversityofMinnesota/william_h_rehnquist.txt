chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
solicitor
general's
suggestion
that
we
construe
the
statute
so
as
not
to
apply
to
nonconsenting...
actions
against
nonconsenting
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
solicitor
general
says,
as
i
understand
his
brief,
that
we
would
avoid
that
constitutional
question
if
we
construed
the
statute
in
the
manner
that
he
asked
us
to
construe
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
constitutional
provision
do
you
say
would
be
violated
if
we
followed
that
suggestion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
supports
your
position
there?
what
case
from
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
state
court
here
found
that
the
state
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
saying
there
wouldn't
be
any
tolling,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
presumably
is
up
to
the
minnesota
courts
to
decide
when
the...
when
the
state
statute
is
tolled.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
know,
you
say
it
isn't
tolling
because
it's...
it
doesn't
really
go
to
the
length
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
one.
but
it
does,
you
know.
if
you
say
the...
if
you
want
to
say
a
statute
of
limitations
is
tolled
for
a
year,
obviously
that
extends
the
time
that
the
state
law
would
have
allowed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there...
is
there
any
indication
that
congress,
when
it
amended
1367,
relied
on
anything
other
than
article
iii?
are
you
suggesting
it
relied
on
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
implicit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
find
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
i'm...
i'm
talking
about
what
congress
thought,
not
what
you
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
my
question
was,
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
congress,
when
it
made
this
amendment,
was
relying
on
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
in
addition
to
article
iii?

industrial
commission.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
congress,
when
passing
a
statute
of
its
own,
could
totally
forbid
a
state
to
enact
a
similar
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
neither
am
i.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bolter.
mr.
rotenberg,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that...
that
goes
quite
far.
what...
what
is
your
reasoning
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
article
iii
is
certainly
a
particular
power.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rotenberg.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
clement,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
in
atascadero
we
interpreted
the
word
person
so
that
it
did
not
include
the
state,
even
though
you
could
say
person
means
a
lot.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
bolter,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bolter.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number

versus
the
regents
of
the
university
of
minnesota
will
be
announced
by
justice
