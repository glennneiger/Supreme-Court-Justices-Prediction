justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
to
have
a
cause
of
action
heard
in
federal
court
against
a
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
suppose
the
state
decided
it
wasn't
going
to
waive
its
immunity.
as
i
understand
it,
in
minnesota,
you
could
bring
this
claim
within
45
days.
the
state
has
waived
its
immunity
for
suit
in
its
own
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so...
but
it...
you're
not
suggesting
that
it
had
to
do
that,
otherwise
there
would
be
a
due
process
violation.
if
that
were
so,
then
the
state
doesn't
have
any
immunity
because
due
process
would
compel
it
to...
to
answer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wouldn't
have
been
if
you
had
filed
a
protective
action.
suppose
you
had...
with
this
uncertain
question
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
from
suit
in
federal
court,
you
could
have,
on
the
same
day
you
filed
in
federal
court
and
took
a
chance
on
that,
filed
a
protective
action
in
minnesota
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
it...
it
wouldn't
have
occasion
to
say
that...
as
i
understand
it,
when
duplicative
actions
are
brought,
the
second
court,
the
one
where
you
file
second,
generally
although
it's
not
compelled
to
do
this,
will
say,
okay,
prior
action
pending.
we'll
stay
this
case
till
the
other
one
is
finished.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have...
you're
using
a
lot
of
mights.
do
you
have
any...
do
we
know
how
minnesota
state
courts
treat
the
prior
action
pending
plea?
do
they
dismiss
or
do
they
keep
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
just...
when
congress
passed
this,
congress
i...
i
assume
was
just
thinking
it
was
regulating
the
procedure
in
federal
courts,
that
it
was
exercising
that
power
to
implement
article
iii.
and
what
you
said
about
due
process,
i
didn't
see
any
sign
of
that
in
the
history
of
1367.
but
you're
not
suggesting
that
before
1367,
people
were
denied
due
process
because
there
wasn't
a
tolling
provision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well...
well,
don't
we
know
that
this
came
out
of
the
federal
courts
study
committee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so...
and
congress
took
the
suggestion
of
that
federal
courts
study
committee,
and
as
far
as
i
recall,
in
that
report,
they
were
talking
about
the
authority
of
congress
to
regulate
the
procedure
in
federal
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bolter,
what
you
said
might
be
so
if
the
only
purpose
of
the
statute
of
limitations
were
repose,
being
notified
on
time
that
you're
subject
to
suit.
but
there
are
certain
statutes
that
have
been
called
so-called
built-in
statute
of
limitations
where
the
limitation
is
considered
part
and
parcel
of
the
right
itself
usually
when
it's
in
the
very
same
statute,
and
that
seems
to
be
the
kind
of
limitation
that
we
have
here.
we
have
a
state
that
is
giving
up
its
sovereign
immunity,
but
only
on
these
terms.
so,
why
isn't
this
a
built-in
statute
of
limitations?
so,
by
necessity
there
would
be
harm
when
the
state
says
it's
the
right...
we
condition
the
right
on
you
bringing
suit
within
45
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bolter,
in
any
event,
that
wouldn't
take
you
very
far
because
so
often
these
pendent
state
claims
are
garden
variety
state
tort
law,
contract
claims,
are
they
not?
i
mean,
there's
the
big
federal
claim,
and
then
you
latch
onto
that
the
state
common
law
claims.
so,
the
state
common
law
claims
could
arise
out
of
the
same
transaction
and
occurrence,
depend
on
the
same
nucleus
of
facts,
and
yet
not
be
just
a
state
counterpart
of
the
federal
statute.
don't
you...
don't
you
have
that
in...
in
civil
rights
cases?
let's
say,
bring
a
1983
claim
against
a
police
officer
and
then
you
latch
onto
it
state
common
law
claims
for
assault
and
battery?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rotenberg,
did...
did
the
minnesota
supreme
court
go
that
far?
i
thought
that
their
decision
as
to
the
unconstitutionality
of
1367
related
only
to
cases
in
which
the
state
was
the
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
to
the
extent
that
you're
asking
us
to
consider
this
broader
theory,
you're
asking
us
to
take
that
up...
to
go
beyond
where
the
minnesota
supreme
court
left
off.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rotenberg,
because
sovereign
immunity
is
kind
of
a
peculiar
objection...
that
is,
the
state...
it's
up
to
the
state
to
waive
it
or
not.
it's
not
like
a
case
where
the
federal
court
wouldn't
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
shouldn't,
at
least
for
the
period
that
the
state
stood
silent,
which
i
understand
was
about
9
months,
in
federal
court...
at
least
for
that
period,
shouldn't
the
state
be
treated
as
having
been
legitimately
before
the
federal
court
not
complaining
about
it?
so,
for
those
9
months,
at
least,
the
limitation
ought
to
be
tolled.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
going
on?
i
understand,
at
least
from
the
dates,
that
this
was
raised
9
months
after
the
litigation
commenced.
usually
an
answer
is
in...
how
many
days?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
said
they
put
it
in
their
answer
within
20
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
think
mr.
rotenberg
was
quite
right
that
the
whole
impulse
of
the
federal
rules
is
you
bring
all
of
your
motions
at
once
and
not
seriatim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they...
if
they
raised
that...
that
eleventh
amendment
in
their
answer
within
the
time
allotted,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
say
that
it
was
a
9-month
thing
that
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
you
know
also
that
you
were
at
risk
of
an
interpretation
of
1367?
justice
souter
suggested
that
there
is
no
ambiguity,
but
at
least
there's
a
respectable
authority
for
saying
there
is
and
that
the
tolling
of
1367(d)
is
limited
to
cases
covered
by
1367(c)
and
would
not
take
in
sovereign
immunity.
