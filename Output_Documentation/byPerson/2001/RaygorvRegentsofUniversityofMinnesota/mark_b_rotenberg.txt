mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
your
honors,
it's
critical
to
focus
on
the
fundamental
issue
of
federalism
presented
in
this
case;
namely,
is
it
congress
or
the
state
that
has
the
power
to
decide
when
that
state
can
be
sued
by
its
own
citizens
in
its
own
courts?
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
your
honor--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--under--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--your
honor,
the...
the
logic...
it
may
be
unconstitutional
is
the
direct
answer
to
your
question.
the
logic--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--justice
breyer,
the...
the
thrust
of
alden
against
maine
is
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power
under
article
i
to
force
a
state
to
submit
to
a
private
suit
for
damages
in
its
own
courts.
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
your
honor,
the
answer
to
that
question
would
depend
on
federal
preemption
principles.
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
under
the
commerce
clause--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--the
reason
they
cannot
do...
the
congress
cannot
do
that,
justice
breyer,
is
because
this
statute,
1367(d),
represents
a
blanket
attempt
by
congress
to
extend
statutes
of
limitations
without
regard
to
the
existence
of
an
independent
power
in
article
i,
such
as
the
war
power
which
may
suffice
to
protect--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--it
will
exist,
your...
your
honor,
in...
in
the--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--well,
not
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
the...
of
the
situation.
this...
this
court
held
that,
in
fact,
there
was
no
power
under
article
i
to
hail
the
state
into
federal
court
in
an
age
case.
so...
and...
and
petitioners
here--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--we...
justice
souter,
we
have
two
arguments,
yes.
the...
the
essential
point
of...
of
alden
relates
to
causes
of
action
against
the
state
sovereign,
and
this
court
in
alden
has
established
a
categorical
rule
that
a
state's
power
to
condition
its
waiver
of
immunity
is...
is
not
subject
to
the
article
i
power
of
congress
to
amend.
in
alden,
this
court
held
that,
to
the
extent
maine
chose
to
consent
to
certain
types
of
suits,
while
maintaining
immunity
in
other
types
of
suits,
it
has
done
no
more
than
exercise
its
privilege
of
sovereignty
concomitant
to
its
constitutional
immunity
from
suit.
so,
that
is
the
first
and
most
important
point
here.
with
regard
to
the...
the
plenary
authority
of
congress
to
adopt
a
sweeping
statute
of
limitations
alteration
in...
in
the
states
that
applies
to
an
unlimited
type
of
claim,
you
have
to
look
at
whether
there
was
an
express
intent
to
abrogate
and--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--and
that
would
take
you
into
a...
a
section
5,
fourteenth
amendment
type
analysis.
and--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--the...
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
if
the
court
needs
to
address
the
question
of
legislative
power,
justice
stevens,
because
there
is
no
case
upholding
a
congressional
power
to
enact
a
sweeping
expansion
of
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
the
reasoning
there,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
simply
that
since
the
founding
convention,
it's
been
clear
that
the
powers
of
congress
are
defined
and
limited,
and
the
residual
legislative
power
does
not
rest
with
congress.
it
rests
with
the
states
under
the
tenth
amendment
under
this
court's
decisions
in
marbury
and
the...
as
recently
as
united
states
against
morrison.
the...
the
point
of
the
matter
is,
your
honors,
that
my
able
petitioners'
counsel
here
has...
has
failed
to
suggest
any
case
law
that
supports
the
enactment
of
a...
of
a
change
in
the
state
statutes
of
limitations
that's
unhinged
from
a
particular
exercise
of
power--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--yes,
your
honor.
but
the
tribunal--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--justice--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
did
not
hold
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
in
all--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--justice
o'connor--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--justice
o'connor,
the...
the--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--justice
o'connor,
it
is
certainly
sufficient
for
this
court
to
address
only
the
alden
principle,
as
justice
kennedy
just
mentioned,
and
restrict
the
holding
to
a
state
sovereign--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--justice
o'connor,
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
statute
can
and,
indeed,
should
be
so
construed.
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
justice
breyer,
this
court
has
not
addressed
the
intersection
between
its
holding
in
alden
against
maine,
which
establishes
a
categorical
rule
that
congress
is
disempowered
from
forcing
a
state
to
defend
itself
against
its
own
citizens
in
its
own
state
courts,
and
the...
the
war
power.
that
case
has
not
been
presented,
and
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--yes,
justice
souter.
the...
my...
my
understanding
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
this
area...
and
alden
isn't
the
only
case
that
stands
for
this
proposition,
of
course...
is
that
congress,
acting
within
its
article
i
power,
is...
has
no
authority
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity.
now,
it
hasn't...
your
honors
have
not
specifically
faced
what
i
would
submit
is
a
very
challenging
issue,
as
suggested
by
justice
o'connor's
question.
do
we
really
mean
each
and
every
exercise
of
article
i
power,
even
and
including
the
war
power
to
protect
sailors
abroad?
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
justice
kennedy,
i
agree,
and
i
think
that
the
practical
answer
in
our
federalism
is
to
allow
the
states
to
exercise
good
judgment
with
respect
to
their
tolling
provisions.
it...
it
strains
the
imagination--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--exactly.
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
justice
breyer,
i
agree
with
you
that
alden
does
not
compel
a
particular
interpretation
of
state
law.
that's
certainly
true.
it
is
also
true
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court
unanimously
determined
that
the
45-day
limitation
on
its
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
is...
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
statute,
as
justice
ginsburg
previously
mentioned,
and
is
an
aspect
of
its...
of
its
sovereign
immunity
and
in...
in
addition
said
that
the
equitable
tolling
principle
could
be
applied.
but
it's
important
to
recall
that
the
minnesota
courts
apply
the
equitable
tolling
principles
in
an
extremely
conservative
fashion.
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
well--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--justice
breyer,
this
court
need
not
affirm
every
sentence
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
decision.
it
only
need
affirm
the
judgment,
and
the
judgment
can
be
affirmed
simply
by
reference
to
the
fact,
the
constitutional
fact,
that
alden
proscribes
congressional
alterations
of...
of
state
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
no,
your
honor.
it...
it
isn't
true
that
minnesota
stood
silent
for
9
months.
the
university
asserted
its
sovereign
immunity
defense
at
the
earliest
opportunity,
namely
in
its
answer,
and...
and
never
in
any
way
suggested
a
waiver
of
such
a...
of
such
a
defense.
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
by
the
states
is
not
to
be
inferred
and
not
to
be
implied.
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
20
days,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
and
we
filed
our
answer
asserting
sovereign
immunity
within
that
time
frame.
there's
nothing
the
university
could
have
done
to
save
their
claim.
the...
they
filed
in
federal
court
merely
48
hours
before
the
statute
of
limitations
would...
the
45-day
rule
would
have
expired
even
under
their
understanding,
meaning
that
a
filing
in
the
wrong
court
suffices
to
be
a
filing
in
the
correct
court.
so,
there's
nothing
the
university
did
to
delay
whatsoever.
moreover,
we
filed
a
dispositive
motion
at...
in
a
timely
way,
consistent
with
the
normal
course
of
litigation
in
this
case.
most
federal
trial
courts
prefer
that
dispositive
motions
not
be
filed
seriatim.
and
we...
we
noticed
the
motion,
and
there
was
a
scheduling
order,
which
plaintiff
knew
about,
in
the
spring
of
1997,
and
we
filed
the
dispositive
motion
asserting
our
sovereign
immunity
in
june
of
'97.
and
even
if
you
would
say
that...
that
somehow
the
petitioners
here
were
not
fully
aware,
as
they
should
have
been,
that
the
university
was
asserting
its
sovereign
immunity
from
the
get-go,
by
june
3,
they
had
a
motion,
a
dispositive
motion,
and
the
filing
in
the
state
forum
still
exceeded
the
45
days.
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
justice
kennedy,
that's
possible
but
that
was
not
what
happened
here,
number
one,
and
number--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--your
honor--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--it
isn't...
it
isn't
my
rule
alone,
your
honor.
pennhurst
explicitly--
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
but
pennhurst
specifically
suggests...
yes.
excuse
me.
pennhurst
explicitly
says
that
the
expedient
of
filing
the
claim
in
the
state
court
will
avoid
any
danger
of
this
kind
occurring.
and...
and
pennhurst
stands
clearly
for
the
proposition
that
a
filing
of
the
state
claim,
a
protective
claim,
which
petitioners'
counsel
here
acknowledged
would
solve
the
problem,
and
filing
the
federal
claim
in
the
federal
forum
is
a
constitutionally
appropriate
expedient.
any
contrary
indication
brings
into
question
the...
the
opinion
of
this
court
in...
in
pennhurst
by
suggesting
that
filing
concomitantly
in
the
state
and
federal
forums
is
somehow
a
due
process
problem.
let
me
conclude
with
an...
a
closing
observation
about
the
due
process
issue.
petitioners
have
not
cited
a
single
case,
not
a
single
case,
holding
that
the
state's
handling
of
pendent
claims,
in
the
absence
of
section
1367,
somehow
violated
due
process.
and
equally
important,
your
honors,
petitioners
do
not
seriously
claim
that
1367(d)
is
a
valid
exercise
of
congress'
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
address
any
supposed
due
process
problems.
the
record
is
simply
bare.
moreover,
due
process
cannot
be
the
basis
of
any
supposed
abrogation
here
because
the
first
element
of
abrogating
the
state's
sovereign
immunity,
using
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
is
an
explicit
statement
of
congress.
there
is
no
such
explicit
statement
of
congress
here.
in
fact,
the
record
is
silent
as
to
any
due
process
claim
either
in
the
halls
of
congress
or
in
the...
in
the
case
law,
at
least
as
cited
or
referred
to
by...
by
petitioners.
and
most
importantly,
your
honors,
and
in
conclusion,
whether
there
might
conceivably
be
an
unfairness
in
some
hypothetical
state
situation,
this
question
of
unfairness
does
not
trump
the
alden
principle,
that
congress
cannot,
by
an
observation
of
unfairness
falling
short
of
a
due
process
issue,
force
a
state
to
submit
to
suit
against
itself
in
its
own
courts.
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
it
may
be
seen
that
way
by
some
plaintiffs,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
b.
rotenberg
thank
you.
