justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
your
view,
the
soldiers
and
sailors
relief
act...
all
of
the
soldiers
in
afghanistan,
when
they
come
back
and
they
find
that
their
statute
of
limitations
has
run
out,
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
extend
the
statute.
is
that
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
there's
presently
a
statute
that
says
when
they
come
back,
people
who
are
in
the
armed
forces,
they
will
discover
that
the
statute
of
limitations
in
the
states
has
been
extended
for
6
months.
in
your...
or
however
long
necessary.
in
your
opinion,
that's
unconstitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what
about...
what
about
tort
reform?
suppose
in
the
tort
reform
statutes
that
pass,
there
is
a
provision
that
somehow
in
there
is
favorable
to
a
plaintiff.
that
could
happen.
and
if
that
does
happen,
then
the
state
doesn't
want
to
follow
it,
unconstitutional
to
apply
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
is
it
constitutional
for
congress
to
pass
a
copyright
law
or
a...
any
of
these
tort
statutes
that
are
federalized
and
say
that
the
states
cannot
pass
a
statute
that
gives
a
cause
of
action
in
tort
that
is
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
they...
they
can
preempt.
fine.
then
if
they
can
do
that,
why
can't
they
shape
the
cause
of
action
in
the
state
so
that
it
corresponds
with
federal
law
by,
for
example,
extending
a
little
bit
or
not
extending
too
much
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
then
the
next
case...
then
the
next
case
we'll
have
is
where
the
soldiers
and
sailors
come
back
and
they
would
like
to
sue
the
state.
maybe
it's
a
pension.
maybe
it's
a
tort.
maybe
it's
a
contract.
there
can
be
many,
many
things
in
states
that...
where
the
residents
have
a
cause
of
action,
and
i
guess
even
your
minimal
position
would
make
it
unconstitutional
for
them
to
do
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
what
bothered
me.
this
may
just
be
a
misprint
or
something,
but
quite
clearly
the
state
of
minnesota
has
the
power
to
say
that
our
consent
extends
to
this
tolling
provision,
doesn't
it?
it
could.
it
could
come
out
the
other
way
if
it
wants
to.
and,
indeed,
they
say
that
the
equitable
tolling
applies
to
their
statute,
don't
they?
all
right.
now,
i
read
their
opinion.
i've
read
this
six
times.
not
six,
but
only
two.
let
me
not
exaggerate.
[laughter]
but...
but
when
they
get
to
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when...
when
they
get
to
the
point,
this
very
point,
it
says,
however,
we
read
alden
to
require
the
university's
waiver
of
immunity
be
limited
to
the...
be
limited
to
the
parameters
set
forth
in
the
statute;
i.e.,
45
days.
well,
alden
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
but
they
seem
to
think...
and
after
all,
they
did
say
that
this
statute
says
45
days,
but
it
doesn't
mean
45
days
in
respect
to
equitable
tolling.
but
they
seem
to
think
that
our
case
alden
required
them
to
limit
it
to
the
45
days,
which
of
course
it
doesn't.
so,
they
seem
to
be
under
a
misapprehension
in
that
respect,
and
i
would
like
you
to
address
that,
what
we
should
do
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
my
question,
of
course,
is,
what
do
we
do
about
that
sentence
in
the
opinion
which
says,
we
read
alden
to
require
that
the
waiver
of
immunity
be
limited
to
45
days?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
that's...
if
they
had
said
exactly
what
you
just
said,
i
wouldn't
have
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
has
that
been
happening?
i
mean,
is
it
the
case
that
the
armed
forces
members
have
been
suing
states
or
not
under
the
act?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
could
be
just
that--
