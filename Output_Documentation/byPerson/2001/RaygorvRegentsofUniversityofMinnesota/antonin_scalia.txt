justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what's
wrong
with,
as
some
courts
did,
conditioning
dismissal
upon...
upon
the
plaintiff's...
upon
the
defendant's
agreement
to...
to
waive
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
if
he
doesn't
waive,
then...
then
you
proceed
in
federal
court
because
it's
just
not...
not
a
proper...
proper
basis
for
dismissing
it.
what's...
what's
the
matter
with
that
solution?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
the
principle
you're
arguing
for...
i'm
just
not
sure
what
its...
what
its
boundaries
are.
the
principle,
as
i
take
it,
is
when...
when
the
federal
government
creates
a
federal
cause
of
action,
any
state
law
that
impedes...
and...
and
allows
that
federal
action
to
be
brought
in
federal
court,
any
state
law
that
impedes
the
bringing
of
that
action
in
federal
court
can
be
repealed
by
the
federal
government.
how
does
that
apply,
for
example,
to
simple
statutes
of
limitations?
let's...
let's
assume
you...
you
have
a
federal
statute
of...
of
a
year
for
certain...
for
a
certain
transaction
or
occurrence.
the
state
statute
for
the
same
transaction
or
occurrence
and
the
state's
cause
of
action
is
just
6
months.
now,
would
you
argue
that
because
of
the
difficulty
of
claims
splitting
and
so
forth,
the
federal
government
can
prescribe
by
statute
that
the
state
cause
of
action
shall
be
extended
to
12
months?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
not?
if
you
say
no,
then
you
acknowledge
the
principle
that,
you
know,
there
are
some
problems
that
have
no
solution,
and...
and
the
mere
fact
that
you're
making
the
federal
cause
of
action
more
difficult
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
there's
federal
power
to...
to
solve
that
particular
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
the
federal
government
wants
to
give
you
12
months
in
its
courts.
that's...
that's
the
policy
that
it's
decided.
we
want
to
give
you
12
months,
and
here's
a
state
which
has
a
state
cause
of
action.
it
is...
it
is
putting
you
to
the
choice.
you
either
forego
the...
the
state
cause
of
action
or...
or
you...
you
file
within
6
months.
doesn't
that
impede,
to
some
extent,
what
the
federal
congress
wanted
to
happen?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
understand
it
isn't,
but...
but
i...
but
the
principle
you're
arguing
for,
it
seems
to
me,
leads
to
that
conclusion,
that
the
federal
government
can...
can
reconfigure
state
causes
of
action
willy-nilly
so
that
they
don't
impede
the
bringing
of
federal
causes
of
action
in
federal
court
as
congress
wishes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
hasn't
been
complied
with
under
state
law.
if...
if
the
state
law
acknowledged
the
filing
in
federal
court
as...
as
satisfying
the
statute
of
limitations,
you
wouldn't
be
here.
the
problem
is
the
state
law
says
you
have
to
file
the
action
in
state
court
within
the
statute
of
limitations
period,
and
we're
not
going
to
give
you
any
grace
period
for
a
false
start
that
you
made
in
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
self-evident.
i
mean,
if
what
you're
saying
is
true,
every
state
would
automatically
allow
tolling
when
suit
is
filed
in
a
federal
court
within
the
state
statute
period.
if
it
were
self-evidently
true
that
the
state
policy
is
not
at
all
offended
by
that,
you
wouldn't
have
a
problem
and
you
wouldn't
be
here
because
every
state
would
say,
well,
it
was
filed
in
federal
court.
that's
good
enough
for
us.
but
it
isn't
good
enough
for
a
lot
of
states.
and...
and,
you
know,
it's
their
policy
we're
talking
about,
and
their
policy
is
you
must
file
in
state
court
within
the
limitations
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
you
rely
just
on
article
iii
or
on
section
5,
which
i
think
is
pretty
remote
in
this
situation.
why...
why
don't
you
rely
on
the
underlying
federal
statute?
there
will
always
be
some
federal
power
that
justified
the
federal
cause
of
action
which
is
the
subject
of
this
extension
provision.
let's
assume
it's
a
commerce
clause
cause
of
action.
under
the
commerce
clause,
the
federal
government
could
have,
if
it
wanted,
eliminated
the
state
cause
of
action
entirely,
couldn't...
couldn't
it?
it
could
have
said,
we...
we
preempt
any
state
action
in
this
field,
and
the
whole
state
cause
of
action
would
be
washed
away.
if
it
can
do
that,
why
can't
it
do
the
lesser
act
of
not
washing
away
the
state
cause
of
action,
but
just
saying,
you
know,
if
you
bring
suit
in
federal
court
on
this
commerce
clause
cause
of
action,
you
get
another
30
days
or
whatever,
45
days,
whatever
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
that
work?
that...
that
makes
me
feel
a
lot
more
comfortable
than
just
relying
on
article
iii.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
trying
to
help
you.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
this
statute
itself
piggy-backs
on
whatever
substantive
federal
statute
exists
out
there,
you
know,
whether
it's
under
the
commerce
clause
or
under
any
other
federal
power.
and...
and
that
federal
power
would
allow
the
total
elimination
of
the
cause
of...
of
the
state
cause
of
action.
why...
why
is
it
unreasonable
to
allow
a
mere
extension
of
the...
of
the
state
limitations
on
that
state
cause
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
whether
and
where
and
not
when.
right?
so,
the
federal
government
could...
could
override
state
statute
of
limitations
on
sovereign
immunity
cases
no
matter
what
because
it's
not
really
part
of
sovereign
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
says,
i'm
willing
to
be
sued
for
1
year,
and
you
say
the
federal
government
doesn't
have
to
observe
that
1
year.
it
can
say,
well,
you
know,
it's
2
years
instead.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
power
will
always
exist
in
the
federal
cause
of
action
that
has
been
brought
in
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
every
case
to
which
this...
this
statute
applies,
there
will
be
involved
a
federal
power
under
article
i.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seemed
like
six.
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
unfairness
is
what
sovereign
immunity
is
all
about,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
to...
to
apply
the
clear
statement
argument,
do
we
not
have
to
at
least
decide
that
it
does
constitute
an
elimination
of
state
sovereign
immunity
to
require
the
tolling
of...
of
the
action
against
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
fine
when
you're
dealing
with
an
ambiguous
statute.
sure,
just
the
mere
presence
of
a
constitutional
doubt
will
cause
you
to
resolve
the
ambiguity
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
doesn't
raise
a
constitutional
principle
so
you
have
sort
of
a
clear
statement
rule,
unless
it's
a
clear
statement
where
there's
a...
but
those
are
ambiguity
cases.
you're...
you're
purporting
to
forego
reliance
upon
ambiguity
and
to
say
even
assuming
that
the
statute
is
clear,
you
should
not
interpret
it
to
apply
to
the
states.
and
now,
do
you
have
any
case
not
involving
ambiguity,
where
we
have
applied
the
clear
statement
rule
without
first
finding
that
it
is
clearly
an
abrogation
of
state
sovereign
immunity?
