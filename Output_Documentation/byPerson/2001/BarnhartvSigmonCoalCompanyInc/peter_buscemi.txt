mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
peter
buscemi
ninety-seven
eleven
g
one
explicitly
says
that
successors
in
interest...
mr.
peter
buscemi
to
signatory
operators
are
liable
for
the
individual
employer...
mr.
peter
buscemi
and
for
the
ninety-two...
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
well,
i
readily
acknowledge
that
you
can
make
both
arguments,
but
i
think
the
better
argument
is
that
it
helps
us
because
it
adds
to
the
incongruity
that
our
opponents
are
trying
to
argue
for
here.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
suspect,
your
honor,
that
the
argument
would
be
made
that
that's
also
not
in
the
statute
and
that,
therefore,
you
can't
import
that
into
the
statute.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
your
honor,
it
may
very
well
not
be
displaced.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
you're
absolutely
right,
justice
scalia,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
congress,
therefore,
should
be
penalized
for
including
some
more
specific
provisions.
mr.
peter
buscemi
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
the
commissioner,
in
assigning
the
beneficiaries,
could
elect
which
of
several
possible
assigned
persons
it
was
going
to
make
the
assignment
to,
and
i
think
that's
all
the
commissioner
has
done
here.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that
may
be,
and
that's
what
our
opponents
argue,
but
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court
right
now.
mr.
peter
buscemi
[inaudible]
mr.
peter
buscemi
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
buscemi
we're
not
saying
it
would
happen
in
each
and
every
case,
your
honor,
but
i
think
certainly
you
you
would
see
a
lot
of
smaller
companies
using
a
transaction
like
this
in
the
future
to
f-
escape
this
liability.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
your
honor,
it,
again,
it
doesn't
specifically
go
down
that
line
and
i'm
not
a-
aware
of
any
case
in
which
you've
taken
the
the
ssa
has
taken
a
a
successor
to
a
related...
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
your
your
honor,
i
i
think
that
if
if
jericol
is
liable,
mr.
peter
buscemi
then
sigmon
would
be
liable
as
a
related
person
to
jericol.
