can
i
interrupt
you
for
a
second
on
just
on
the
word
described?
does
the
word
described
have
any
meaning
other
than
simply
refer
to
insofar
as
it
refers
to
any
of
the
signi-
in
any
of
the
entities
described
in
subparagraphs
i
two
i
and
three
i?
does
it
do
anything
other
than,
in
fact,
identify
each?
justice
john
paul
stevens
give
you
a
definition,
for
example,
of
a
controlled
group.
justice
john
paul
stevens
only
meaning
that
can
logically
be
given
to
the
word
described
in
the
context
of
this
statute
is
the
one
you
give
to
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
your
opponent
is
right,
everybody
would
have
a
motive
to
sell
out
right
away.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right
away.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
clarify
one
point
in
response
to
ju-
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg?
you
do
agree,
do
you
not,
that
even
though
this
sale
was
an
asset
sale,
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
successor
in
interest
of
a
signatory
here,
within
the
meaning
of
ninety-seven
oh
one
c?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
term
successor,
at
least
in
this
statute,
includes
a
purchaser
that
at
an
at
an
asset
sale
as
well
as
a
purchaser
of
stock.
justice
john
paul
stevens
conceded
that
you
are
success-
your
client
is
a
suc-
c-
successor
in
interest
of
a
s-
signatory
operator?
justice
john
paul
stevens
successor
liability
in
a
way
that
you've
been
nu-
unable
to
explain
makes
any
sense
whatsoever,
that
there's
no
reason
to
impose
successor
liability
on
the
successor
of
a
related
person,
while
not
imposing
it
on
a
successor
of
a
signatory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
successors
of
related
persons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
suggesting
there's
a
difference
between
successor
in
interest
and
successor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
it
only
refers
to
s-
s-
a
limited
class.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
merely
emphasizes
the
incongruity
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
i
understand
the
definition
of
related
persons,
it
could
cover
p-
people
not
even
in
the
coal
business
at
all...
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you've
discounted
the
significance
of
the
legislative
history,
ju-
the
senator's
comment
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it's
perfectly
clear
congress
intended
otherwise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
make
it
perfectly
clear
to
justice
scalia.
justice
john
paul
stevens
makes
it
so
anomalous
to
impose
successor
liability
on
successors
of
re-
related
persons
who
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
coal
industry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
here
there's
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
whoever
is
covered
it
was
intended
to
be
the
statute
was
intended
to
have
retroactive
effect.
