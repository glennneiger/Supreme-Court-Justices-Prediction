court.
congress
enacted
the
coal
act
to
prevent
the
collapse
of
a
multi
employer,
private
health
care
system
that
had
promised
health
care
benefits
to
retired
coal
miners.
miners
were
in
danger
of
losing
their
benefits
as
coal
operators
were
selling
their
operations
and
dissolving
and
going
out
of
business
and
shifting
responsibility
for
their
employees
to
other
employers
that
were
in
the
multi
employer
health
care
system.
congress
enacted
the
coal
act
to
stop
this
downward
spiral.
it
wanted
to
ensure
that
a
retired
miner's
benefits
would
be
the
responsibility
of
the
operator
that
employed
the
miner,
if
possible,
or
if
that
operator
was
defunct,
with
one
of
that
operator's
related
persons.
section
ninety-seven
oh
one
c
two
of
the
coal
act
effectuates
this
policy.
that
section
sets
forth
the
related
persons
who
may
be
assigned
responsibility
for
a
miner's
emp-
for
an
operator's
employees.
under
a
straightforward
reading
of
that
statutory
language
in
section
ninety-seven
oh
one
c
two,
the
commissioner
may
assign
a
miner
to
the
direct
successor
in
interest
of
a
signatory
operator.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
i-
u-
it
is
true
that
he
did
not
agree
with
us,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
plain
text
of
the
statute
did
not
support
our
reading,
but
i
have
to
respectfully
disagree
with
the
dissenting
judge
because
it
is
our
position
that
it
does.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it
depends
on
the
meaning
that
you
give
to
the
word
to
describe.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
th-
there
are
two
possible
approaches
to
this
question,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
and
that
is
an
established
common
usage
of
the
meaning

mr.

wolfson
well,
several
things.
mr.

q.
wolfson
well,
it's
not
just
a
a
question
of
not

there's

mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
congress
ever
deliberately
left
behind
a
provision
for...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
there
were
many
co-
contentious
issues
involved
in
the
framing
of
the
coal
act.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
first,
it's
important
to
remember
that
the
coal
operators
were
getting
very
significant
relief
from
the
coal
act,
which
is
to
say
that
the
the
members
of
the
bituminous
coal
op-
coal
operators
association
who
were
at
that
time
being
forced
to
shoulder
the
costs
of
the
retire-
of
the
employer-
the
retirees
of
the
employers
who
had
already
gone
out
of
business,
they
received
a
a
a
great
deal
of
benefit
from
the
coal
act
because
tho-
because
the
coal
act
adopted
the
the
approach
of
going
back
in
time
and
reaching
some
of
those
people
who
had
disappeared,
and
the
problem
was
that
they
had
disappeared
and
shifted
and
disappeared
and
nobody
had
been
there
to
to
to
pick
up
the
the
cost.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
had
been
some
indication
in
the
legislative
background
that
this
was
a
contentious
issue
and
that
there
was
attempt
to,
as
the
respondents
have
said,
reclaim
what
was
given
away
in
the
compromise,
then
then
there
might
be
some
substance
at
that
point.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
it's
n-
i-
it's
not
that
you
have
to
be
explicit.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that
that's
not
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
can't
i
can't
state
how
many
because
there
are
sixteen
thousand
assignments
and
they
are
not...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
to
adopt
that
view,
one
ha-
a-
one
would
have
to
know
for
certain
that
related
persons
were
necessarily
not
coal
compa-
not
also
coal
companies.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
first,
i
would
not
agree
that
we
lose
on
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
wolfson,
you
have
half
a
minute
remaining.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
very
briefly.
