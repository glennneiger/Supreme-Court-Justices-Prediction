i
understand
it,
there
hasn't
been
any
court
that
has
accepted
your
reading
so
that
courts,
whether
the
person
was
writing
in
dissent
or
in
the
majority,
have
rejected
your
reading
as
an
impermissible
one.
justice

that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
basis
th-
what
the
text
says.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
you're
relying
on
an
illogic
between
the
related
people
and
their
and
their
successors
count
and
not
the
successors
of
the
the
operator.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
tha-
not
in
many
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
this
was
a
minimal
likelihood,
the
other
was
a
much
more
substantial
risk
for
the
coal
companies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
something
else.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
follow
that
because
isn't
it
just
standard
corporate
law
that
if
you
sell
out
your
assets
and
then
quit
business
and
there
are
liabilities
out
there,
that
your
shareholders
will
be
stuck
with
that
liability
up
to
the
amount
that
they
gained
from
the
asset
sale?
isn't
that
just
standard
corporate
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
that
why
would
that
state
law
be
displaced?
the
standard
provision
for
a
company
that
sells
its
assets
and
then
goes
out
of
business,
for
there
to
be
shareholder
liability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
meaning
would
be
make
the
successor
equal
to
the
the
signatory
corporation,
and
that's
not
what
you're
urging,
and
that's
not
what
mr.
wolfson
suggested
the
statute
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
also
i
don't
understand
because
i'm
not
sure
that
the
the
when
when
the
title
one
defines
successor,
it
is
talking
about
the
person
who
buys
assets.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
saying
that
the
dictionary
act
the
use
of
the
word
successor
in
the
dictionary
act
is
not
the
use
of
the
word
if
justice
breyer
was
right
that
successor
means
successor,
but
i
thought
successor,
in
the
meaning
of
the
dictionary
act,
was
not
the
kind
of
successor
that
we're
dealing
with
here
that
is
an
asset
sale,
but
was
the
successor
corporation
when
two
corporations
merge,
when
one
corporation
acquires
another.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
define
successor
in
interest
to
include
a
kind
of
an
asset
sale.
