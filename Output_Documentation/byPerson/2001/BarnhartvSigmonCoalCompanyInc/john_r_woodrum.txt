mr.
john
r.
woodrum
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
i
don't
know
that
there
is
any
policy
reason
for
imposing...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
i
think
congress
made
that
choice
because,
as
justice
scalia
has
has
noted,
this
was
a
statute
that
came
togethe-
came
together
very
quickly
under
great
pressure.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
i
don't
know,
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
well
the-
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
the
the
one
possible
reason
why
that
is
there
is
that
it
was
never
intended
to
have
the
broad
meaning
which
the
commissioner
has
given
it,
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
the
i
don't
know
why
it's
there.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
i
think
it
came
out
that
way
because
when
you
look
at
the
parallelism
of
the
earlier
draft
of
the
statute,
there
had
been
provisions
that
were
parallel.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
to
put
in
justice
breyer's
question
was
why
might
there
be
a
reference
to
successor
in
interest
of
a
related
person...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
and
not
a
such
a
reference
to...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
a
successor
in
interest
of
the
direct
signatory.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
no.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
it
would
be
if
it's
unexplained
inadvertence,
it
would
be
in
leaving
in
language...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
the
proble-
the
problem
is
that
a-
and
that's
why
the
courts
tend
to
enforce
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
as
written
is
because
we
don't
know
what
happens
in
those
discussions,
in
those
negotiations
that
lead
to
the
enact-
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
speaks
to
it...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
well,
let
me
explain
each
of
those
those
two
comments.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
justice
breyer,
the
the
title
one
dictionary
act
by
its
terms
is
to
be
applied
when
there
is
no
evidence...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
ample
evidence
in
this
statute
that
congress
specifically
considered
both
questions
of
successor
and
successors
in
interest
because
those
terms
are
used
throughout
the
statute.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
judge
ginsburg,
and
that's...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
well.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
again,
the
dictionary
act
is
of
general
background
relevance
to
the
court
to
provide
assistance
where
congress
hasn't
spoken
to
the
issue.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
rule.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
to
not
having
that
term
appear
in
section
ninety-seven
oh
one
c
two.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
as
the
commissioner
has
defined
it,
that
issue
as
to
whether...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
no,
your
honor,
e-
it
doesn't
necessarily
include
that.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
as
as
the
commissioner...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
well,
i-
the
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
exactly,
judge
ginsburg,
and
that's
why
it
would
be
remanded
for
further
determinations,
although
the
williams
mountain
court,
the
the
dc
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
several
months
ago
in
the
case
of
williams
mountain
did
define
that
term
to
they
didn't
give
it
a
specific
definition,
but
they
said
it's
somewhere
between
a
tax
code
successor
and
the
black's
law
dictionary
common
law
successor,
which
does
not
include
asset...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
we
would
not
rely
on
the
dictionary
act
as
having
any
relevance
on
remand.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
it
doesn't,
the
statute
does
not
impose
liability
on
successors.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
no,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
yes,
i
i
i
believe...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
well,
typically
if
you
look
at
the
black's
law
dictionary
or
the
common
law
application
of
successor
in
interest,
it
is
statutory
succession,
merger,
name
change
successors,
and
so
forth.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
well,
it
it
really
i
don't
know
the
reason
for
that.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
other
than
the
the
notation
this
morning
by
the
solicitor
general,
there
we
weren't
aware
that
the
commissioner
had
ever
made...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
i
don't
think
so,
with
all
due
respect,
because
what
what
happened
or
or
what
is
a
plausible
scenario
is
that
we
have
fifty
years
of
retroactivity
in
commercial
transactions
that
have
occurred
in
the
coal
industry.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
the
thing
about
that
definition
is
and
the
reason
it
has
some
logic
to
expanding
liability
is
it
does
encompass
entities
that
have
an
economic
connection
with
the
employer.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
which
is
the
problem
with
the
commissioner's
linguistic
gymnastics
in
trying
to
say
that
the
the
commissioner's
definition
in
that
case
would
basically
mean
that
there's
always
a
control
group
because
one
is
always
related
to
himself.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
i
don't
think
it
would
be
any
more...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
exactly.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
we
would
still
have
all
the
linguistic
problems
with
with...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
it's...
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
well,
it
it's
not
applicable
here.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
the
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
is
that
the
language
of
the
statute
controls
when
it's
clear.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
yes.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
it
makes
it
makes
for
a
a
rational
jurisprudence
when
one
tends
to
enforce
the
the
language
that's
actually
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
but
if
but
if
that
question
comes
to
the
court,
the
court
will
have
to
deal
with
that
question
as
to
whether
that
is
liability
that
may
be
enforced
and
imposed
on
such
distantly
related
entities
for
historic
transactions
under
the
same
criteria
that
the
court
used,
for
example,
in
the
eastern
enterprises
case.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
exactly.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
yes,
if
they
weren't
there
to
represent
their
interests,
then
a-
and
they
likely
weren't
since,
i
don't
think,
anybody
that
is
that
distance,
distantly
related
would
ha-
have
even
been
aware
that
there
was
a
problem
in
funding
benefits.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
the
final
point
is
that
if
this
language
is
enforced
as
written,
the
benefits
are
going
to
be
provided
to
the
shackleford
beneficiaries
on
a
pro
rata
basis
by
all
the
operators
who
are
assigned
liability,
including
jericol,
to
the
extent
it
o-
it
otherwise
has
valid
liability
for
people
that
it
did
employ.
mr.
john
r.
woodrum
yes,
your
honor.
