like
is
a
a
an
exa-
a
canon,
for
example,
that
says
something
like
it
is
permissible
for
a
court
to
accept
an
absurdly
literal
meaning
reading
of
a
statute
where
necessary
to
avoid
an
absurd
result.

so,
if
it's
inadvertent
if
it's
inadvertent,
i
think
we
should
try,
as
hard
as
possible,
to
get
the
interpretation
they
would
have
wanted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
there
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
makes
no
sense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
possible
explanation
could
there
be
other
than
a
legislative
mistake?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
what
what
what
what
th-
you
said
there
is
no
reason
that
you
can
think
of.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look
to
this
part
of
the
record,
but
there
is
legislative
history
that
to
me
strongly
suggests
there
was
no
such
political
deal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
what
you're
saying
is
completely
true,
that
this
was
not
a
deal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
in
here
indicates
otherwise?
isn't
that
the
issue?
the
issue
is
not
the
meaning
of
the
of
of
whether
one,
two,
and
three
include
assigns.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see,
which
is
fine,
which
i'll
let
you
do
and
i'd
like
you
to
do,
but
note
that
what
you're
doing
is
not
addressing,
as
i
think
you're
quite
right,
whether
you
can
shoehorn
successors
into
paragraphs
one,
two,
and
three,
which
is
pretty
tough
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
what
the
what
it
says
is,
literally,
pretend
that
the
word
successor
appears
in
the
statute
that
you're
reading.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
in
there
says
that
i
can't
read
this
as
applying
to
an
asset
sale
as
well
as
any
other
kind
of
transfer?
