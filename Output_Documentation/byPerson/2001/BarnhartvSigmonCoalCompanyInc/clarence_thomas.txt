justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
coal
industry
retirement
health
benefit
act
of
1992
charges
petitioner,
the
commissioner
of
social
security
with
the
task
of
assigning
fiscal
responsibility
for
the
health
benefits
of
coal
industry
retirees
who
worked
for
signatory
operators.
signatory
operators
are
those
coal
operators
that
are
signatories
to
coal
wage
agreements
that
require
contributions
to
the
1950
or
the
1974
benefits
plans.
the
commissioner
assigned
responsibility
for
the
health
benefits
of
86
retired
coal
miners
to
respondent
jericol
coal
mining
company
on
the
basis
that
jericol
was
a
successor
in
interest
to
an
out-of-business
signatory
operator
that
had
employed
the
retired
miners.
jericol
and
respondents
sigmon
are
related
person
under
the
act
challenge
these
assignments
arguing
that
the
coal
act
does
not
permit
the
commissioner
to
assign
retired
miners
to
successors
in
interest
to
out-of-business
signatory
operators.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
agreed
with
jericol.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
the
statute
carefully
delineates
which
entities
are
responsible
for
the
health
benefits
of
retired
miners.
it
requires
the
commissioner
to
assign
responsibility
for
the
benefits
of
retired
miners
to
one
of
three
categories
of
signatory
operators
or
where
a
signatory
operator
is
no
longer
in
business
to
a
defined
group
of
related
persons
to
that
signatory
operator.
the
commissioner
contends
that
jericol
qualifies
as
a
related
person
because
it
is
a
successor
in
interest
to
the
signatory
operator
that
employed
the
retired
miners.
we
disagree.
under
the
act
an
entity
qualifies
as
a
related
person
if
that
entity
is:
one,
a
member
of
the
controlled
group
of
corporations
that
includes
the
signatory
operator;
two,
a
trade
or
business
that
is
under
common
control
with
the
signatory
operator;
or
three,
a
trade
or
business
that
has
a
partnership
interest
or
joint
venture
with
the
signatory
operator.
a
successor
in
interest
to
an
entity
described
in
the
three
categories
also
qualifies
as
a
related
person.
jericol
is
neither
an
entity
described
in
those
three
categories
nor
a
successor
in
interest
to
any
such
entity
because
the
statute
is
explicit
as
to
who
may
be
assigned
liability
for
beneficiaries
and
neither
the
related
persons
provisions
nor
any
other
provision
states
that
such
successors
in
interests
to
signatory
operators
may
be
assigned
the
liability.
the
unambiguous
statutory
text
precludes
the
assignment
of
these
retired
miners
to
jericol.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
oâ€™connor
and
breyer
have
joined.
