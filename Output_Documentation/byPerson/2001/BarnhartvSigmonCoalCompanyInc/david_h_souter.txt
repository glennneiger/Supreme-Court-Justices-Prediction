problem,
as
i
understand
it,
in
just
the
way
you
feel
we
should
address
it
in
in
some
of
the
bills
in
predecessor
sessions
of
of
the
congress
in
which
they
specifically
did
include
successors
to
the
signatories.

souter
horse
trading
has
got
to
be
explicit.
justice
david
h.
souter
going
back
to
your
argument
that
there,
the
the
other
side's
position
is
simply
an
an
immediate
inducement
to
sell,
isn't
one
answer
to
that
that
if
that's
what
the
the
the
signatory
does,
it's
going
to
be
the
signatory's
brother
sister
corporations
or
parent
corporations
that
are,
in
effect,
going
to
m-
m-
probably
going
to
be
penalized,
as
it
were,
with
liability?
and
isn't
that
the
reason
why
the
inducement
that
you
refer
to
does
not
operate
in
such
an
automatic
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
it
would
depend
on
how
control
is
exerted,
but
presumably
in
some
of
these
relationships,
there
would
be
a
sufficient
degree
of
control
to
exert
that
would
would
prevent
this
untoward
result.
justice
david
h.
souter
never
put
in?
justice
david
h.
souter
bill,
it
was
never...
justice
david
h.
souter
do
any
ripping
to
the
text
with
which
they
started
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
go
one
step
further
than
justice
scalia's
question
and
and
and
ask
you
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
leave
it
as
kind
of
inec-
unexplained
inadvertence.
