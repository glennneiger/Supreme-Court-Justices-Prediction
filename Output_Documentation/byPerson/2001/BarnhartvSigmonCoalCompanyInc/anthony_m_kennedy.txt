justice
anthony

i
do
i
do
have
one
question
on
on
on
the
basic
statutory
point,
the
s-
the
shoehorning
question
of
whether
or
not
shackleford
is
is
is
described
in
the
statute.
justice
anthony

so,
then
s-
roman
one
would
not
apply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
shackleford
had
been
a
member
of
a
controlled
group
of
corporations,
then
it
might
have
been
included
in
the
controlled
group
and
then
it
might
have
been
described.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
been
a
member
of
a
controlled
group,
not
a
group
of
one,
that
argument
would
have
been
slightly
more
plausible,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
i
talk
about
shackleford,
i
mean
the
first
shackleford.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
if
it
had
been,
i
think
the
commissioner
would
have
had
a
better
argument,
and
it
would
still
have
the
problem
of
being
related
to
yourself.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
think
all
because
it
is
the
word
there
is
include...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
o-
one.
