justice
antonin
scalia
between
a
provision
which
says
a
member
of
the
controlled
group
of
corporations
which
includes
the
signatory
operation,
or
a
a
more
detailed
description,
any
other
person
who
is
identified
as
having
a
partnership
interest
or
joint
venture
with
a
signatory
operator,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
prologue.
justice
antonin
scalia
person
is
and
then
it
goes
one,
two
three.
justice
antonin
scalia
statute
that's
ever
been
interpreted
that
way
where
it,
you
know,
describes
certain...
justice
antonin
scalia
in
certain
clauses
in
a
later
provision
says
any
person
described
in
such
and
it
includes
a
reference
to
signatory?
justice
antonin
scalia
thought
there
would
be
something,
you
know,
at
least
close
to
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
closest
example
you
can
think
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
meant
what
it
says,
and
and
i
w-
why
do
you
assert
that
it
is
it
is
in-
unbelievable
that
congress
would
have
meant
what
it
said
here?
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
the
that
the
persons
who
would
have
been
most
affected
by
the
interpretation
of
this
language
that
you
im-
you
that
you
propose
would
have
been
the
very
coal
mine
operators
who
were
lobbying
congress
to
get
this
thing
passed.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
not
be
a
good
policy
result.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
very
good
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
were
the
major
players
in
in
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
best
they
could
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
entirely
conceivable.
justice
antonin
scalia
h-
how
d-
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
if
it
if
it
did
that,
it
wouldn't
have
had
to
have
the
last
the
last
clause
of
of
section
ninety-seven
oh
one
c
two,
which
says
a
related
person
shall
also
include
a
successor
in
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there's
no
conceivable
reason,
i'm
i'm
inclined
to
say,
yeah,
maybe
you
know,
maybe
it
was
a...
justice
antonin
scalia
we
should
regard
it
as
a
scrivener's
error.
justice
antonin
scalia
make
you
think
that
this
was
intentional,
but
you...
justice
antonin
scalia
conceive
of
any
reason
why
somebody
would
do
that
intentionally.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
know
which
mistake
it
is,
justice
antonin
scalia
failing
to
include
the
the
original
owners
or
including
the...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
later
language
instead
of
ignoring
this
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
[inaudible]
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
you're
you're
not
saying,
are
you,
that
you
know
for
a
fact
that
there
was
not
this
this
kind
of
motive,
to
simply
save
the
liability
of
the
initial
coal
owners?
you
you
don't
know
for
a
fact
that
that
was
not
why
it
was
eliminated,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
don't
don't
blame
it
on
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
cannot
fairly
have
it
both
ways.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
way
it
it
can
be
perfectly
clear
that
congress
intended
otherwise
is
for
both
houses
of
congress,
not
a
single
committee
of
one
congress,
to
have
enacted
the
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
perfectly
clear
that
both
houses
intended
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
these
people
were
distant
not
only
from
the
transactions
in
question
but
also
from
the
negotiations
that
produced
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
and
that
may
well
be
the
ex-
explanation
of
why
they
got
stuck.
