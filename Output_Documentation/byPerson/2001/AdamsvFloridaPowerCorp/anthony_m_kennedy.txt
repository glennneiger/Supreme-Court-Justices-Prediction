well,
you
want
us
to
consider
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
employer
has
no
intent
to
discriminate.
he
actually
has,
his
intentions
are
absolutely
pure,
but
in
some
instances,
he
is
still
going
to
be
liable
under
the
adverse,
pardon
me,
disparate
impact
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
that
even
if
we
accept
your
reading
of
the
statute
which
i
am
not
sure
is
the
more
natural
reading,
you
still
have
because
of
such
individual's
age,
that
is
to
say
what
you
would
call
disparate
impact,
what
the
statute
says
adverse
impact
must
still
be
because
of
such
individual's
age
and
if
we
think
because
of,
implies
or
necessarily
requires
a
bad
purpose,
you
still
had
the
same
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
you
are
going
to
the
second.
just
so
i'm
focusing
in
on
this.
(a)(2),
it
seems
to
me
that
your
reading
of
the
statute
doesn't
explain
because
of,
then
you
have
to
go
to
this
other
part
of
the
statute,
which
you
have
to
do
any
way.
so
i
mean
this
whole
argument
over
how
to
interpret
2
it
seems
to
me
doesn't
get
you
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--please.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
want.
i
think
you
should
be
able
to
reserve
your
rebuttal
time.
but
i
do
have
one
question.
you
seem
to
exceed
to
justice
o'connor's
suggestion
that
griggs
involving
racial
discrimination
involved
deeply
rooted
attitudes
which
called
for
special
rules,
and
that
those
just
don't
apply
with
the
age
factor.
would
you
want
us
to
write
the
opinion
that
way,
or
are
there
some
subtle
biases
against
elderly
workers
that
are
important
to
support
your
theory?
if
you
train
a
worker,
you
are
going
to
get
a
better
return
on
your
investment
as
the
worker
is
younger,
etcetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
you
were
going
to
tell
us
that
because
of
age,
is
within
of
your
strongest
points,
and
as
justice
o'connor
said,
that's
the
same
language
structure
that
we
had
in
griggs,
and
that
we
would
have
to
interpret
them
differently.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
but,
but
then
you
automatically
throw
me
over
i
guess
to
part
(f)
and
talk
about
reasonable
factors
other
than
age,
which
is
exactly
what
the
petition
wanted
to--
