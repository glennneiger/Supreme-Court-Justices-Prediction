justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
conceded
that
it
was
not
enough
for
you
to
show
disparate
impact.
that
you
had,
say
70
percent
of
the
people
and
my
problem
with
your
presentation
is
the
same
as
justice
stevens.
in
every
disparate
impact
case
that
i
know,
a
rule
neutral
is
on
its
face
that
disparate
impact
like
the
high
school
diploma
requirement
in
griggs,
there
is
the
standard
that
has
a
differential
effect.
a
high
school
diploma,
a
pen
and
paper
test
as
in
washington
v.
davis,
a
height,
weight
requirement
as
in
dothard
vs.
rawlinson,
but
you
don't
come
to
us
with
any
rule,
standard,
practice.
you
just
say
reduction
in
force.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
event,
the
wording
is
identical
to
title
vii,
and
title
vii
on
that
words
has
been
held
to
have
this
differential
impact
theory
for
sex,
as
well
as
race.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
after
title
vii,
but
before
griggs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as...
may
i
go
back
to
the
question
that
we
opened
with,
and
that
is
i
don't
know
of
any
case
under
title
vii
where
someone
could
just
say
reduction
in
force
affected
more
women
than
men,
therefore,
i
have
an
impact
case
or
reduction
in
force,
it
affected
more
minorities
than
majorities
so
therefore.
it's
always
been
some
specific
practice
that
you
could
identify
some
rule,
some
neutral
rule.
in
fact,
it's
even
sometimes
referred
to
as
neutralized
base
discriminatory
and
impact.
here
i
don't...
reduction
of
force
in
and
of
itself
is
not
such
a
neutral
rule.
it's...
it's
too
general.
so
i,
what
is
the
precise
rule
practice
standard
that's
comparable
to
a
high
school
diploma,
a
height
and
weight.
what
is
there
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
think
that
the
district
court
finding
allows
you
to
say
the
standard,
the
standard
is
the
reduction
itself
because
the
district
judge
said
that
the
people
involved
held
a
wide
variety
of
jobs,
were
managed
and
supervised
by
different
people
and
were
terminated
at
different
times
by
different
decision
makers
based
on
different
considerations
of
criteria,
and
that
seems
to
me
just
wholly
to
reject
that
there
is
a
rule
or
a
standard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
your
closest
precedent
under
title
vii
dealing
with
race
or
dealing
with
sex
where
you
have
something
so
groundly
general
as
a
reduction
in
force
with
different
decisions,
different
standards,
different
times?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
nothing
more
specific
than
a
reduction
in
force?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
view
is
well,
title
vii,
the
court
really
got
it
wrong.
they
are
not
good
grammarians,
but
that's
stare
decisis
so
we'll
leave
it
alone,
because
it's
the
identical
wording,
the
f
part
i
think
you
may
have
more
of
an
argument
there
because
it's
not
found
in
title
vii.
but
if
your
grammar
argument
has
to
be
saying,
and
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
this,
the
court
really
got
it
wrong
in
griggs
because
there
is
no
room
for
an
impact
test
under
title
vii
any
more
than
under
age,
but
because
the
court
said
it
in
1971
and
continued
to
say
it,
we
are
stuck
with
it,
but
we
don't
have
to
make
the
same
mistake
again.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
can
see
you
point
to
(f)
in
the
reasonableness
because
there
is
no
counterpart
to
that
in
title
vii,
but
frankly--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--frankly,
i
would
find
it
unseemly
to
take
the
identical
words
and
say
we
ignore
the
comma
in
one
case.
if
we
had
paid
attention
to
the
comma,
you
have
to
reach
the
same
result.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
very
point
i
made
to
you,
and
you
rejected
it.
i
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
here
we
know
even
though
griggs
didn't
come
until
sometime
later,
the
congress
did,
when
it
wrote
the
age
discrimination
act,
it
did
copy
quite
deliberately
the
title
vii
language.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
a
different
argument,
looking
at
the
statute
as
a
whole
and
saying
whatever
the
first
part
means,
here
we
have
another
part
that's
absent
from
title
vii
so
we
don't
have
to
interpret
it
the
same
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
understand
better
than
i
have
from
your
argument
why
you
say
it's
the
reasonable
factor
is
not
a
defense?
you
are
saying
it's
like
the
equal
pay
act,
which
says
any
factor,
any
other
factor
other
than
sex.
and
that's
always
been
regarded
as
a
defense
to
an
equal
pay
charge.
you
are
charged
with
a
violation
of
equal
pay
and
you
say
no,
it
was
based
on
any
other
factor
other
than
sex.
why
isn't
it,
since
you
are
using
the
equal
pay
act
to
say
there
is
no
impact
theory
under
the
equal
pay
act,
why
isn't
this
equally
a
defense,
rather
than
as
you
say,
part
of
the
definition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
were
both
making
arguments?
i
thought,
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
this,
that
your
opponent
was
saying
that
this
f
provision
is
just
like
business
necessity
under
title
vii
and
you
said
i
thought,
no,
it's
as
in
the
equal
pay
act
when,
where
there
is
no
impact
test
under
the
equal
pay
act.
i
thought
that
was
our
argument.
maybe
i
misread
you.
but
i
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well
then,
let's
just
take
the
two
statutes.
one
says
reasonable
factor,
and
the
other
says
any
factor,
any
other
factor
other
than
sex.
same
kind
of
provision.
why
in
one
case
is
it
a
defense
and
the
other
case,
part
of
the
definition
of
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
don't
follow
why
it
isn't,
you
couldn't
make
the
very
same
argument
about
the
equal
pay
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
another
one
we
are
stuck
with
it
because
it's
stare
decisis,
isn't
it?
