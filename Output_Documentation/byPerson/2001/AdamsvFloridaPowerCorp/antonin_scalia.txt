justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
very
handy
prophylactic
rule,
but
with
it,
once
you,
once
you
acknowledge
that
indeed
the
malicious
intent
is
necessary
with
it,
with
the
rule
that
you
propose,
you
are
going
to
get
a
lot
of
employers
that
have
no
such
malicious
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
say
it
is
bad
in
itself.
it
is
not
bad
because
it
shows
malicious
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
if
the
only
reason
it's
bad
is
because
it
shows
malicious
intent,
my
goodness,
it
seems
to
me
it
goes
much
too
far.
there
are
a
lot
of
employers
who
have
in
place
policies
that
may
affect
elderly
employees
more
harshly
who,
you
know,
have
no
intent
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
good
idea.
what
is
the
statute
that
we
are
dealing
with
here?
can
we
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
it
relates
to,
to
the
limit,
segregate
or
classify.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
this
language
adopted
in
this
form
after
it
had
been
clearly
established
that
the
title
vii
language
did
include
disparate
impact?
you
know,
as
an
original
matter,
i
wouldn't
have
thought
it
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
held
that.
now,
was
this
language
adopted
after
we
held
that
or
before
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
crabtree,
i
thought
the
question
on
which
we
granted
certiorari
was
not
whether
this
particular
claim
of
disparate
impact
was
too
general
or
not
specific
enough.
but
whether
the
whole,
read
it,
is
a
disparate
impact
method
of
proving
age
discrimination
available
to
plaintiffs.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
would
hope
you
would
address
justice
breyer's
question
in
which
he
said
why
should
we
do
this
to
say
that
tenured
employees
are
the
higher
salaried
employees?
what
would
be
the
justification
in
a
case
such
as
that
for
using
your
theory
of
liability?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
provision
doesn't
really
solve
justice
breyer's
problem,
does
it,
because
it
puts
the
burden
on
the
employer
to
establish
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
still
in
a
situation
where
the
employer
said
well
he
could
have
done
it
a
lot
of
different
ways
and
you
are
saying
i'm
sorry,
that's
no
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
still
a
burden
on
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
crabtree,
could
i
just
come
back
for
a
moment
to,
to
your
argument
which
i
think
is
an
important
one
that
some
of
the
defenses
don't
make
sense
unless
there
is
a
discriminatory
impact
basis.
what
about
the
defense
that
says
it
will
not
be
unlawful
to
discharge
or
otherwise
discipline
an
individual,
an
individual,
for
good
cause?
i
mean,
that's
obviously
a
redundancy.
it
can
only
imply
to
an
intentional
discrimination
case,
not
to
a,
not
to
an
impact
case.
but
it's
obviously
redundant
because
if
you
are
disciplining
him
for
good
cause,
you
are
obviously
not
disciplining
him
with
a
motive
of
punishing
his
age.
it's
just
thoroughly
redundant.
it
seems
to
me
a
lot
of
these
defenses
are
redundant.
they
are
just
there
to
make
clear
that
there
are
safe
harbors,
one
of
which
is
disciplining
an
individual
for
good
cause.
another
one
is
observing
the
terms
of
a
seniority
system
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
i
don't,
i
don't
know
any
seniority
systems
that
go
on
the
basis
of
people's
age
as
opposed
to
how
long
they
have
been
working
there.
do
you
know
any
seniority
systems
that
say
you
have
more
seniority
if
you
are
65?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
redundant.
it's
just
redundant
the
way
to
discharge,
it's
lawful
to
discharge
an
individual
for
good
cause.
of
course
it's
redundant.
you
don't
have
to
say
that
once
you
say
that
there
has
to
be
either
intentional
discrimination,
or
as
you
would
say,
adverse
impact.
you
are
talking
about
disciplining
an
individual.
you
really
don't
need
that.
once
you
say
there
has
to
be
intentional
discrimination,
but
it's
there
just
to
make
everything
that
much
clearer.
and
you
can
make
the
same
argument
about
the
bfo
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we
look
at
the
whole
statute,
as
you
said,
not
just
the
comma.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
comma
could
be
outweighed
by
other
factors
in
one
statute,
and
not
in
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
comma
is
not
a
very
big
thing,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
say
a
comma
is
not
a
very
big
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
are
wrong
the
first
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
stare
decisis
would
require
us
to
accept
for
title
vii
but
wouldn't
require
us
to
accept
for
this
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you
do
you
do
in
the
argument,
which
i
think
is
an
interesting
one,
that
it
is
a
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
if,
if
there
were
an
intent
requirement
in
the
act,
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
you
are
using
reasonable
factors
or
not,
so
long
as
you
are
not
using
age.
you
know,
i
don't
like
people
with
blue
eyes.
that
ought
to
be
good
enough,
so
long
as
blue
eyes
has
nothing
to
do
with
age.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
it
have
to
be
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age?
i'm
not
sure
you
have
answered
my
question?
so
long
as
it's
not
age,
the
intent
factor
is
not
satisfied.
you
should
be
able
to
use
an
unreasonable
factor
other
than
age.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
it's
a
safe
harbor
provision
for
sure
if
it's
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age,
it's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
bfoq.
based
on
reasonable
factors.
it's
hard
to
get
around
that.
based
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--isn't
the
answer
to
justice
breyer's
concern
about
the
employer
who
has
an
unreasonable
criteria
that
in
fact
has
a
bad
impact
upon
older
workers?
isn't
the
answer
that
there
is
a
sanction,
and
that
is
a
jury
is
unlikely
to
believe
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
lawyer
advising
such,
such
a,
such
an
employer
would
say
boy,
if
you
are
dragged
into
court,
and
nobody
is
going
to
believe
that
you
didn't
adopt
this
for
the
reason
of
getting
rid
of
older
employees.
that
seems
to
me--
