justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
because
it's
always
helpful
to
me
to
know,
what's
at
stake
in
the
particular
case.
what
is
the
practice
that
you
claim
has
a
disparate
impact
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
reductions
in
force
are
always
practices
that
if
they
have
a
disparate
impact,
give
rise
to
a,
an
age
discrimination
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
different
about
the
reduction
in
force
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
disparate
treatment
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
is
what
i...
excuse
me
for
interrupting,
but
is
it
the
decision
to
downsize
that
it
has
to
be
reasonable
or
the
particular
discharge
decisions
on
each
individual
have
to
be
reasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
decision
to
downsize
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
it
be
more
difficult?
all
i
have
to
prove
if
i
understand
your
theory
is
that
there
are
more
older
workers
in
the
group
that
were
discharged
than
younger
workers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just
interrupt.
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have...
you
think
that
because
of
such
individual's
age
or
more
normally
refers
to
the
very
first
part
of
the
paragraph
that
talks
in
the
plural
rather
than
the
singular?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
any
individual.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
the
effect
that
that
modifies,
not
the
classification.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
former
is
plural
and
the
because
of
is
singular?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
it
perfectly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
bad
news
for
any
of
us.
but
there
is
statistics
that
show
that.
and
you
might
come
back
and
say
i
didn't
realize
that
or
something
like
that.
it
would
be
enough
for
you
to
show
that,
that
that's
totally
irrelevant
because
you
just
didn't
realize
that
fact.
but
why
then
would
they
need
to
say
you
have
to
defend
that
as
a
reasonable
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
gave
that
answer.
may
i
just
ask
you
this
just
to
think
through
the
problem
a
little
bit.
assume
i
agree
with
you
100
percent
that
the
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
defense
is
a
motive-based
defense,
why
couldn't
you
have
a
good
motive
defense
to
a
prima
facie
case
that's
based
on
objective
factors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
even
as
read
in
a
defense,
it's
an
exclusion
category
case,
the
motive.
but
whether
it's
a
defense
or
an
exclusion,
the
fact
that
it
is
motive-based
doesn't
seem
to
me
necessarily
to
mean
that
the
prima
facie
case
must
also
be
motive-based.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand
that.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
perfectly
reasonable
if
you
treat
disparate
treatment,
i
mean
a
disparate
impact
as
prima
facie
evidence
of
a
wrongful
intent.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
not
also
be
an
appropriate
response
even
if
disparate
treatment
was
sufficient
regardless
of
the
actual
intent.
it
makes
good
sense
for
congress
to
put
this
defense
in
any
way.
i'm
not
sure
you
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--assume
your
opponent
is
right.
that
disparate
impact,
which
is
totally
innocent
in
terms
of
any
malicious
intent
creates
a
prima
facie
case.
would
it
not
nevertheless
be
sensible
for
congress
to
say
yes,
all
that
is
true,
but
if
you
have
the
right
kind
of
good
motive
describes
in
this
paragraph,
that
shall
nevertheless
be
a
defense?
