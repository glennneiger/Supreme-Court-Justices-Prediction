chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
on
number
01-584,
wanda
adams
vs.
florida
power
corporation
and
florida
progress
corporation.
mr.
crabtree.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
crabtree,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
situation
where
you
are
claiming
that
the
fact
of
disparate
impact
gives
rise
to
a
permissible
inference
of
intentional
discrimination.
you
are
relying
just
on
disparate
impact
alone,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now
in
washington
against
davis,
we
held
that
disparate
impact
was
not
enough
by
itself
under
the
statute
or
constitution
that
you
could
infer
from
it
an
intent
to
discriminate.
now,
are
you,
i
didn't
get
the
impression
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
you
are
arguing
that
this
plan
by
the
respondent
supports
an
inference
of
an
intent
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
age.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
so
you
are
relying
on
disparate
impact
alone?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
each
of
those
cases,
mr.
crabtree,
it
says
because
of
such
individual's
age.
now,
doesn't
that
suggest
that
there
is
some
motive
requirement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
one,
one
might
feel
that
griggs
is
stare
decisis
because
it
could
feel
that
perhaps
it
reasonably
would
not
readily
be
extended
if
there
was
some
reason
for
distinguishing
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
emphasize
reason.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
crabtree.
mr.
nager,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nager.
mr.
crabtree,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
crabtree.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
01-584,
adams
versus
florida
power
corporation.
the
writ
is
dismissed
as
improperly
granted.
