mr.
glen
d.
nager
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
address
why
fully
consistent
and
giving
full
respect
to
griggs
vs.
duke
power
company,
this
court
can
and
should
hold
that
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
does
not
make--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--justice
o'connor,
it's
not.
it
is
common
language
in
section
4,
but
this
court
doesn't
construe
language
in
a
statute
in
isolation
from
the
remainder
of
the
statute,
and
the
remainder
of
this
statute
is
quite
different.
the
remainder
of
the
statute
includes
the
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
provision.
the
remainder
of
this
statute
is
based
upon
a
report
of
the
secretary
of
labor
which
said
that
the
problems
of
age
discrimination
in
the
workplace
were
quite
distinct
and
quite
different
from
the
problems
that
motivated
the
enactment
of
title
vii
and
it's
the
problems
that
motivated
the
enactment
of
title
vii
which
gave
rise
to
griggs.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
griggs.
it's
what
your
opinion
for
the
court
says
in
watson.
so
what,
if
we
look
at
the
statute,
stat
industry
language
not
in
isolation,
because
in
fact,
we
can
read
all
of
the
court's
title
vii
disparate
impact
cases
and
we
won't
see
the
language
parsed.
the
court
looked
at
that
language
in
terms.
overall
objectives
of
the
statute,
and
rendered
a
decision
in
light
of
the
distinct
and
enormous
problems
race
discrimination
of
this
country
has
faced
and
dealt
with.
age
discrimination,
the
congress
itself
recognized
was
different.
that's
why
it
didn't
include
age
in
title
vii.
instead
it
commissioned
a
report
from
the
secretary
of
labor
as
tell
us
about
the
problems
of
older
workers.
recommend
legislation
to
us.
and
the
bill,
the
report
that
was
commissioned
was
submitted.
this
court
repeatedly
in
eeoc
vs.
wyoming,
in
hazen
paper,
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
that
report
set
the
foundation
for
the
statute.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
you
are
right,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
my
lack
of
clarity,
justice
kennedy.
what
we
are
suggesting
to
the
court
is
the
more
natural
construction
of
the
language
in
4(a),
the
because
of
language,
is
an
intent
requirement.
the
fact
of
that
intent
requirement
is
confirmed
and
compelled
by
the
remaining
provisions
in
the
statute.
our
suggestion
is
just
as
your
opinion
in
ohio
public
employee
retirement
system
vs.
betts
did.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes,
justice
stevens,
because
the
structure
of
the
statute
says
that
the
employer
can't
limit,
segregate
or
classify
his
employees
in
a
way
that
has
an
adverse
effect
on
an
individual.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
because
of
such
individual's
age.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no.
the
comma
in
that
provision,
i
think
eliminates
any
ambiguity
because
of
what
the
because
of
phrase
modifies.
that
it
modifies
the
verbs
to
limit,
segregate
or
classify.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
because
the
sentence
has
to
be
read
as
a
whole.
it
says
limit,
segregate
or
classify
the
employees
in
a
way
that
has
an
effect
on
an
individual
because
of
the
individual's
age.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
but
the--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--it
is...
i
would
grant
you
that
it
is
not
the
most
elegantly
written
sentence
in
the
world,
but
i
would
also
urge
upon
you,
your
honor,
that
the
comma
in
that
sentence
grammatically
compels
that
the
because
of
phrase
modifies
the
to
limit,
segregate
or
classify.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
not
here
to
challenge
griggs
in
any
respect.
i
am
here
to
say
that
the
more
natural
construction
of
that
language
was
not
the
one
the
court
adopted
in
griggs,
and
just
as
this
court
does
that
on
occasion
because
of
other
materials
that
influences
the
construction
of
a
statute.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
the
point.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
and
that
is
what
the
court
has
found
in
its
title
vii
cases.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i'm
sorry,
could
you--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
it
is
part
of
the
statute,
and
we
think
it
has
to
be
taken
into
account,
but
our
argument
that
the
age
discrimination
employment
act
should
not
be
allowed
to
recognize
disparate
impact
claims
does
not
rest
solely
on
the
comma.
our
point
about
section
4(a),
justice
kennedy
and
justice
ginsburg
is
that
the
more
natural
construction
of
that
language
is
the,
an
intent
requirement,
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
recognized
in
his
separate
opinion
on
certiorari
in
geller
vs.
markham.
the
fact
that
the
court
found
other
considerations
to
lead
to
a
different
conclusion
in
the
context
of
a
limited
class
of
title
vii
cases
does
not
compel
a
particular
construction
of
the
age
discrimination
employment
act.
we
have
to
look
at
those
other
considerations
that
inform
the
construction
of
the
age
discrimination
act.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i
don't
think
it's
unseemly
at
all,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i'm
not
here
to
take--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--justice
ginsburg,
this
court
has
on
any
number
of
occasions,
and
i'll
use
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
fogerty
vs.
fantasy
in
as
administration
said
that
identical
language
in
two
separate
statutes
can
be
given
two
different
meanings
by
this
court
if
a
single
meaning
isn't
compelled
by
the
words
themselves
and
if
the
statute
it
different
purposes
or
different
legislative
history.
you
joined
that
opinion.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
true.
but
it
is
also
the
case
that
it
did
not
copy
the
4(f)(1)
language.
it
is
also
the
case
that
at
the
time--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i
have
two
points.
congress
couldn't
have
known
about
griggs
at
the
time
that
the,
that
it
used
the
language
from
title
vii
in
4(a)
because
griggs
hadn't
yet
been
decided,
so
that
was
not
a
well-established
construction
by
this
court
in
1967.
but
you
are
also
right,
it
is
the
essence
of
our
argument
here,
not
to
ask
the
court
to
construe
4(a)
in
isolation.
it's
to
ask
the
court
to
do
as
it
did
in
betts
and
as
it
does
in
any
number
of
cases
to
construe
4(a)
in
light
of
the
other
provisions.
justice
scalia
has
made
the
point
about
the
discharge
for
cause.
we
also
make
the
point
about
the
reasonable
factors
other
than
age.
that
is
an
intent-based
provision
and
it
shows
that
this
statute
at
every
turn
was
concerned
with
employer
intent,
whether
it
be
good
cause,
whether
it
be
decisions.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it
is--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--as
you
have
pointed
out,
justice
scalia,
it's
perfectly
appropriate
for
congress
to
clarify
and
make
unambiguous
in
any
respect
conceivable
that
it
does
not
want
any
decision
that's
based
upon
a
reasonable
factor
to
be
subject
to
liability
under
this
statute.
secondly--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--the
answer
to
that
is
no.
the
reason
that
it's
no
is
because
whatever
one
thinks
the
reasonable
factor
other
than
the
word
reasonable
and
the
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
means,
it's
still
a
motive-based
test
based
upon
what
considerations
are
you
taking
into
account,
and--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--you
absolutely
can.
section
4
f
simply
clarifies
what's
lawful.
it
doesn't
tell
us
what's
unlawful.
we
only
can
find
what's
unlawful
by
going
to
4(a)
and
reading
it
in
light
of
the
provisions
in
4(a).
mr.
glen
d.
nager
and
it
tells
us
more
than
that,
justice
scalia.
it
tells
us
that
intent
is
what
counts.
interestingly
enough,
our
opponents
in
both
their
opening
brief
and
their
reply
brief
concede
that
the
phrase
based
upon
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
is
a
reference
to
an
intent
requirement,
and
the
whole
notion,
as
justice
breyer
has
pointed
out
through
his
questioning
at
the
opening
of
this
argument,
is
what
distinguishes
a
disparate
treatment
case
from
an
impact
case
is
that
intent
is
irrelevant,
so
if
reasonable
factors
other
than
age--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--bad
news
for
us.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
legislative
history
and
the
secretary's
report
makes
quite
clear
why
they
put
the
reasonable
in
there,
because
they
were
concerned
about
the
mixed
motive
cases.
this
statute,
when
it
was
originally
discussed,
the
question
came
up,
does
this
mean
age
has
to
be
the
only
factor
that's
considered
in
order
for
it
to
be
lawful
solely?
and
the
answer
to
that
was
the
secretary
came
back
and
said
no.
we
recognize
that
employers
have
been
considering
age
for
a
long
time.
what
we
think
the
congress
should
prohibit
is
the
use
of
age
as
a
screening
device
to
filter.
now,
will
still
be
the
case
because
human
beings
are
human
beings
that
employers
will
still
be
cognizant
of
employees'
age.
it
can't
help
but
be.
but
so
long
as
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
is
the
basis
of
the
decision,
there
should
be
no
liability
for
it.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
every
time
that
the
mixed
motive
issue
has
been
discussed,
this
court
in
construing
title
vii,
in
construing
the
national
labor
relations
act,
in
construing
the
constitution,
the
1983
and
mt.
healthy
city
cases,
has
always
put
an
adjective,
motivating
factor,
substantial
factor.
congress
is
speaking
in
common
sense
terms
in
writing
these
clarifying
provisions
to
make
it
clear
that
age
had
to
be
the
but-for
cause
of
an
employment
action,
and
the
employer
had
to
intend
it
that
we
give
you
the
illustration,
our
brief
of
judge
wright's
opinion
for
the
d.c.
circuit
in
cuddy
vs.
carmen,
which
talks
about
how
the
two
provisions
were
intended
to
work
in
tandem
just
as
justice
kennedy's
opinion
for
this
court
in
betts
said
that
4(f)(2)
and
4(a)
were
supposed
to
work
in
tandem
to
define
the
elements
of
a
plaintiff's
case.
could
4(a)
have
been
written
and
construed
without
a
clarifying
provision?
of
course.
and
we
would
be
taking
that
position
whether
that
additional
language
was
there
or
not.
but
it
doesn't
weaken
our
argument
in
the
slightest
that
congress
went
further
and
clarified
what
the
standards
would
be
in
mixed
motive
case.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
correct.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
reasonableness
goes,
is
a
permissible,
the
reasonableness
of
a
nondiscriminatory
factor
that
an
employer
offers
is
something
that
a
judge
can
consider
and
if
he
finds
a
disputed
issue
of
fact,
a
jury
can
consider
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
nondiscriminatory
factor
that
is
offered
is
a
pretext
for
age
discrimination.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
correct.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i
understand
your
point,
justice
souder,
and
i
will
be
the
first
to
acknowledge
this
case
would
be
easier
if
the
word
reasonable
weren't
there.
but
all
the
court
has
to
decide
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
statute
embraces
a
disparate
impact
test.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i
just
wanted
to
make
the
following
point.
whether
it's
a
reasonable
motive
or
an
unreasonable
motive,
it's
still
a
motive
and
that's
incompatible
with
disparate
impact.
the
question
is
one
of
intent,
not
one
of
statistical
correlations
with
age
and
not
one
of
accuracy
and
verifiability
of
business
judgment
which
are
the
two
core
issues
in
a
disparate
impact
case.
what
distinguishes
fundamentally
a
disparate
treatment
case
from
a
disparate
impact
case
is
that
in
a
treatment
case
while
statistics
are
appropriate
statistics
would
satisfy
delbare
are
admissible,
and
can
go
to
motive,
the
issue
that
we
argue
to
the
jury
is
motive.
we
don't
argue
about
whether
or
not
the
correlation
is
so
substantial
that
it
itself
would
state
a
prima
facie
violation
and
the
jury
is
not
allowed
to
question
the
employer's
business
judgment
if
it
finds
that
in
fact
the
employer
was
not
motivated
by
age,
and
that
makes
a
huge
difference
at
a
practical
level
and
a
legal
level
in
the
resolution
of
age
discrimination
cases,
and
that
of
course
is
why
we
would
say
that
impact
claims
should
not
be
recognized.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
true.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
there
is
a
way
of
dealing
with
it.
i
think
justice
o'connor's
opinion
for
the
court
in
hazen
paper
sets
it
out
for
us,
but
it
doesn't
require
the
recognition
of
a
disparate
impact
claim.
justice
o'connor's
opinion
for
the
court
in
hazen
paper
says
that
merely
showing
a
correlation
is
not
enough
to
create
an
inference
of
disparate
treatment,
but
the
court
left
open
the
question
if
the
employer,
the
reason
they
used
the
factor,
there
was
evidence
that
they
thought
that
that
factor
should
be
used.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i
can
only
answer
the
question
the
following
two
ways.
i
don't
think
congress
contemplated
which
may
be
my
legal
answer
for
you.
and
i
can
answer
it
to
you
practically
because
i
advise
employers
on
these
issues,
and
the
way
we
deal
with
these
issues
now
is
not
to
change
the
practices
unless
we
find
they
are
really
ridiculous.
the
way
we
advise
our
employers
to
deal
with
these
practices
now
is
to
use
quotas.
when
we
advise
employers
if
they
are
doing
a
reduction
in
force
as
to
how
to
reduce
the
probability
of
a
disparate
impact
claim
and
the
circuits
that
have
recognized
them,
we
take
out
little
five-year
age
bans
and
under
40
and
over
40
and
we
assess
who
is
included
within
it
and
who
isn't
included
within
it,
and
we
tell
them
if
you
don't
change
the
numbers,
you
face
a
greater
exposure
to
a
claim.
now,
that
is,
i
guess
one
way
of
discouraging
employers
from
having
thoughtless,
even
though
not
aged
biased
practice
by
the
sword
of
a
major
lawsuit.
whether
or
not
that's
a
legally
common--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
my
opinion
is
that
the
statute
doesn't
say
reasonably
necessary.
that's
what
the
bfoq
provision
says.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes.
it's,
the
entire
phrase
has
to
be
read.
it
says
based
on
it.
what
are
the
factors?
and
that's
a
reference
to
motive.
we
know
that
from
the
ordinary
english
language,
we
know
it
from
this
court's
own
cases
talking
about
factors,
and
we
know
it
from
the
legislative
history
because
the
secretary
of
labor
in
studying
and
reporting
to
congress
at
congress'
legislative
direction
distinguished
between
purposeful
uses
of
age
as
stereotypes
of
the
abilities
of
older
workers,
and
other
forces
that
adversely
impact
older
workers
and
what
the
secretary
of
labor
recommended
to
deal
with
your
problem
that
you
pointed
out,
justice
breyer,
is
not
a
coercive
sanction
that
used,
made
neutral
practices
with
disparate
effects
illegal.
what
the
secretary
of
labor
recommended
to
congress
and
congress
adopted
his
recommendation
in
the
act
of
a
statute
was
the
promotion
of
education,
training
and
manpower
programs
both
to
get
employers
to
better
understand
the
talents
and
capabilities
of
older
workers
and
where
older
workers
were...
i
don't
know
about
iq,
with
you
they
can--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--yes.
that's
the
answer
i
gave,
but
he
told
me
i--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--it's
a
much
better
answer
than
i
gave.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
defense.
i
should
state
that.
i
think
that
the
provision
is
not
in
there
as
an
affirmative
defense.
i
think
the
provision
is
in
there
to
clarify
what
the
scope
of
the
prohibitio
is.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
if
we
are
talking
about
a
disparate
treatment
case,
i
agree
with
you,
justice
stevens,
that
in
an
appropriate
case
with
an
appropriate
statistical
presentation,
a
judge
would
be
justified
in
saying
that
the
plaintiff
has
presented
enough
evidence
to
require
the
employer
to
respond
to
a
disparate
treatment
allegation.
now,
you
know,
it's
hard
to
speak
universally
about
statistical
presentation.
most
of
them
in
my
experience
may
satisfy
delbare,
but
don't
tell
us
very
much
about
the
real
merits
of
the
case,
but
if
we
adopt
as
the
premise
that
you
have
got
a
particularly
powerful
statistical
presentation,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
case
law
and
certainly
not
from
this
court
because
teamsters
and
cases
like
that
say
that
statistics
are
admissible
to
prove
intent,
that
a
plaintiff
couldn't
have
statistics
alone
as
their
prima
facie
case,
but
it
would
be
about
intent,
and
the
employer
would
be
responding
about
its
own
intent.
it
wouldn't
be
responding
about
as
the
employer
does
in
title
vii
cases,
about...
now,
we
not
only
had
a
good
motive.
here's
the
proof
that
we
were
right
about
what
we
were
trying
to
predict,
because
that
is
what
the
rebuttal
burden
in
a
title
vii
dispute.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
the
question.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i
think
that
would
make
good
sense,
but
i
think
that
congress
was
advised
by
the
secretary
of
labor
that
we
are
going
to
see
correlations
between
age
and
neutral
selection
criteria
all
the
time,
and
i
don't
think
that
congress
had
in
mind
that
foreseeable
adverse
impacts
are
not
done
because
of
but
in
spite
of
should
be
a
common
basis
for
a
prima
facie
case,
should
it
be
called
disparate
treatment
or
disparate
impact.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
perhaps
our
argument
was
not
clear.
we
were
not
referring
to
the
equal
pay
act
in
the
way
that
your
question
suggests.
the
only
mention
we
made
of
the
equal
pay
act
was
where
we
made
the
point
that
the
court
in
construing
title
vii
disparate
impact
doctrine
has
suggested
in
county
of
washington
vs.
gunther
and
in
justice
stevens'
opinion
for
the
court
in
manhart,
the
disparate
impact
claims
would
not
be
cognizable
in
the
areas
of
pay
disparities
correlated
with
gender
because
the
bennett
amendment
incorporated
the
effect
of
the
equal
pay
act
defenses
into
title
vii.
it's
our
opponents
who
have
made
arguments
based
upon
gunther
that
there
is
something
different
about
this.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no.
that
was
not
our
argument,
justice
ginsburg.
our
argument
was
that
the
reason,
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
court
can
and
should
rule
that
the
age
discrimination
act
doesn't
recognize
disparate
impact
claims
and
be
completely
consistent
and
respectful
of
griggs
is
that
the
court
in
title
vii
cases
has
recognized
that
other
provisions
of
the
statute
may
cause
griggs
to
yield
to
other
congressional
manifestations
of
intent
requirements
in
specific
areas.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
court
construed
the
four
so-called
affirmative
defenses
as
affirmative
defenses
under
the
equal
pay
act.
this
court
in
betts
recognized
that
when
congress
wrote
4(f),
they
didn't
intend
for
all
the
provisions
in
4(f)
to
be
affirmative
defenses.
some
of
them
were
affirmative
defenses.
this
court
in
criswell
held
that
the
bfoq
was
an
affirmative
defense.
4(f)(2)
was
held
not
to
be
an
affirmative
defense
but
was
held
to
be
an
exemption
that
redefined
the
elements
of
a
prima
facie
case
and
our
suggestion
to
the
court
is
since
the
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
provision
is
not
a
provision
in
which
the
employer
is
trying
to
justify
the
use
of
age,
employer
is
saying
our
decision
should
be
held
lawful
because
it's
based
upon
factors
other
than
age
that
it's
not
appropriate
to
characterize
that
as
an
affirmative
defense,
but
rather--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
i
suppose
if
i
had
been
before
the
court
in
1974
arguing
that
case,
i
might
have
made
that
argument.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
no.
we
just
recognize
that
we
have
a
different
statute
and
we
also
have
a
different
court.
i
mean,
the
fact
that--
