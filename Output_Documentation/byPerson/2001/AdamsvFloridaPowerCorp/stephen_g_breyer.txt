stephen
g.
breyer
why
don't
we
leave
motive
out
of
it
for
purposes...
forget
motive.
let's
imagine
in
your
case,
that's
what
i
thought
this
case
was
about,
we
imagine
in
your
case
the
employer
had
a
wonderful
motive.
there
are
other
cases
where
the
rule
in
question
was
we
are
going
to
fire
some
tenured
teachers
to
save
money.
that
was
the
real
reason
to
save
money.
the
tenured
teachers
tend
to
be
older
teachers.
there
was
another
case
in
which
they
said
the
court
looked
at
a
rule
that
said
we
will
fire
people
in
the
higher-paid
positions.
that
was
their
real
reason
to
save
money.
but
the
court
said
each
of
those
rules
like
your
case,
too,
has
a
disparate
impact
on
older
employees.
and
just
saving
money
is
not
a
justification
and
therefore
the
plaintiff
wins.
now,
i
take
it
that's
the
proposition
you
are
defending.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
the
other
parts
to
me
are
easy.
of
course
you
can
use
it
to
prove
bad
motive,
et
cetera,
but
that's
the
hard
proposition.
now,
i
wish
you
would
explain
why
as
a
matter
of
law
that
tough
proposition
nonetheless
is
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
most
instances,
they
can't
explain
it
very
well.
in
most
instances,
i
think
in
a
business
or
a
university,
you
begin
to
look
into
it,
and
it
dissolves
in
front
of
your
eyes.
people
say
you
could
do
it
this
way,
you
could
do
it
that
way,
you
could
do
it
some
other
way,
and
it
will
turn
out
you
haven't
thought
about
it
that
much.
now,
it
may
well
be
sensible
to
make
an
employer
go
to
that
effort
we
are
talking
about
race
and
gender,
and
yet
here,
there
is
so
many
rules
correlated
with
age.
there
are
so
many
that
how
could
the
employer
run
his
business
where
you
are
going
to
have
a
court
second-guessing
every
single
rule
that's
correlated
with
age.
that's
the
problem.
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
would
your
test
be?
i
mean
do
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
cases
i
mentioned
was
right?
i
mean,
if
you
are
going
to
apply
exactly
the
same
tough
tests
as
in
these
other
places,
maybe
they
were.
what's
your
opinion
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
say
what
i
think
the
form
of
words
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
may
i
go
back
to
your
argument
of
a
minute
ago
that
the,
that
the
various
defenses
make
no
sense
except
on
the
disparate
impact
theory
possibility
of
disparate
impact
theory.
what
is
your
response
to
the
argument
that
they
make
equally
good
sense
on
the
theory
that
they
respond
to
mixed
motive
discharges?
what's
your
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anywhere
we
can
go,
is
there
any
way
if
you
were
finished,
were
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
way,
which
i'm
sure
you
don't
want
to
bring
up
necessarily,
but
is
there
any
way
short
of
saying
there
is
never
a
disparate
impact
claim?
the
problem
that
you
mention
could
be
alleviated.
if
i
think,
for
example,
that
unlike
race
or
gender,
we
might
about
into
an
ordinary
company
and
find
dozens
or
hundreds
or
maybe
virtually
every
rule
or
practice
or
limitation
connected
with
promotions
is
correlated
with
age.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
the
other
hand,
you
might
have
some
rules
that
are
really
correlated
with
age
very
heavily
and
have
no
justification.
all
right,
so
is
there
a
way
of
dealing
with
that
problem
short
of
saying
there
is
never
a
disparate
impact
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
denies
my
hypothetical.
that's
saying
you
are
going
to
go
over
to
intent.
what
i'm
asking
you
is
if
in
fact
the
language
here
does
justify
a
disparate
impact
case,
a
real
one,
what
i
have
been
talking
about
throughout.
is
there
any
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
practicalities,
which
is
a
big
one?
that
distinguishes
this
from
race
and
gender.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
don't
have
the
power
to
do
which
this
case
i
guess
does
ask
us
to
do
possibly,
and
that
is
also
to
look
at
the
question
of
the
defense
here
and
say
what
does
it
mean
in
context?
i
mean,
you
could
say,
for
example,
reasonably
necessary
means
necessary.
or
you
could
say
that
reasonably
necessary
means
a
reasonable
practice
giving
weight
to
the
employer's
reasonable
judgment
in
this.
there
are
a
lot
of
things
you
could
say.
so
i
want
your
opinion
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
a
very
good
answer.
i
wanted
to
know
whether
there
was
any
other
answer.
