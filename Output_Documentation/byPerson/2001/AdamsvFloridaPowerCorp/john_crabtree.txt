mr.
john
crabtree
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
core
reasons
why
the
court
should
hold
the
disparate
impact
is
an
available
method
of
proof
in
age
discrimination
cases.
first,
the
court
held
in
griggs
that
identical
prohibitory
language
prohibited
facially
neutral
actions
by
an
employer
to
disproportionately
impacted
the
protected
class.
mr.
john
crabtree
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
disparate
impact
both
serves
the
purpose
of
proving
indirectly
that
perhaps
subconscious
biases
exist,
as
well
as
detecting
biases
that
could
otherwise
be
concealed.
mr.
john
crabtree
we
believe
it
does
support
an
inference
of
an
intent,
an
intent
that
does
not
need
to
be
proven,
that
it
justifies
that
it
can
justify
the
necessity
for
the
doctrine
because
without
it,
it
would
be
easy
for
an
employer
to
conceal
its
intent
for
example,
an
employer
could
choose
a
device
like
a
five-year
rule
in
which
they
said
that
we
won't
hire
anybody
with
more
than
five
years'
experience
or
we'll
have
speed
tests.
mr.
john
crabtree
justice
scalia,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
malicious
intent
is
required
at
all
for
disparate
impact.
we
are
suggesting
that
disparate
impact
will
detect
that
as
well,
or
at
least
the
provision--
mr.
john
crabtree
--that's
certainly
true.
we
absolutely
believe
that.
mr.
john
crabtree
that's
certainly
true,
and
definitely,
the
doctrine
goes
beyond
that.
but
what
we
are
suggesting
is
it
will
also,
it
also
prevents
an
employer
from
being
able
to
hide
behind--
mr.
john
crabtree
--in
many
instances,
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
crabtree
that
is
our
position.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
crabtree
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
crabtree
we
have
alleged
in
this
case
that
the
employer's
reduction
in
force
has
had
a
disparate
impact
upon
the
older
workers,
the
selection
device
of
the
older
workers.
mr.
john
crabtree
no,
your
honor,
because
in
virtually
every
instance
where
there
is
reduction
in
force
it
will
be
quite
easy
for
the
employer
to
satisfy
the
defense
under
the
reasonable
factors
of
the
age
provision
of
the
act.
mr.
john
crabtree
well,
in
this
case,
your
honor,
as
the
district
court
acknowledged
in
its
opinion
that
we
are
proceeding
from,
we
had
evidence
that
the
highest
levels
that
the
decision
to
undertake
the
downsizing
was
actually
a
decision
to
get
rid
of,
intended
to
get
rid
of
older
workers.
mr.
john
crabtree
unfortunately,
it's
not,
your
honor,
because
as
the
district
court
judge
acknowledged,
we
could
not
make
a
disparate
treatment
case
under
these
facts
because
in
the
disparate
treatment
case,
we
would
still
have
to
prove,
unless
we
could
make
a
cat's
paw
analysis
that
the
actual
decision
maker
harbored
an
animus
against
the
employee
that's
terminated.
but
we
are
suggesting
under
this
model
and
under
this
framework
is
that
if
we
can
make
a
prima
facie
i
can't
case
of
disparate
impact,
then
the
employer
can
justify
that
impact
by
showing
that
its
decision
was
based
upon
reasonable
factors
and
that
those
reasonable
factors--
mr.
john
crabtree
--we
have
identified
in
this
case
the
action
of
the
employer
as
being
the
decision
to
downsize
itself.
mr.
john
crabtree
which
mr.
most
instances
will
be
much
more
difficult
probably
for
plaintiffs
than
it
would
be
if
you
want
on
a
more
micro-level.
however--
mr.
john
crabtree
--will,
it
would
have
to
be
a
substantially
disparate
impact
between
the
two
groups.
it
would
be
more
difficult
because
it
would
be
much
easier
for
an
employer
to
justify
a
reduction
in
force
in
almost
any
circumstance.
mr.
john
crabtree
well,
what
we
are
saying
is
this,
is
that
the
court
indicated
in
wards
cove
that
the
plaintiff
in
an
age...
in
a
discrimination
case
is
to
identify
a
specific
practice
or
action
by
an
employer
that
results
in
disparate
impact
that
cannot
be
justified.
we
have
identified
this
downsizing
as
being
such
a
practice
because
we
don't
believe
the
employer
can
justify
because
the
downsizing
was
motivated
by
desire
to--
mr.
john
crabtree
--we
are
defending
that
proposition.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
crabtree
well,
we
believe
it's
the
law
because
the
prohibitions
themselves
as
construed
in
griggs
apply
to
actions
and
then
the
reasonable--
mr.
john
crabtree
--no,
justice
o'connor,
we
do
not.
mr.
john
crabtree
respectfully,
no,
your
honor.
and
here's
why.
as
the
court
acknowledged
in
watson,
the
court
is
not
limited
a
disparate
impact
to
remedying
past
problems
with
discrimination.
disparate
impact
goes
beyond
that.
disparate
impact
exists
to
detect
subconscious
stereotypes
operating
in
the
work
force,
exactly
what
the
court
identified
as
the
primary
form
of
discrimination
that
exists
under
the
adea.
thirdly,
in
griggs
the
court
said
that
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
act
was
"plain
from
the
language
of
the
statute."
so
the
court
was
looking
at
the
statute
itself.
mr.
john
crabtree
sure,
your
honor.
it's
on
page
5.a,
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief.
and
when
you
look
at
the
statute
itself,
what
you
see
between
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2)
is
a
difference
between
a
micro
and
a
macro-orientation.
in
(a)(1),
we
are
concerned
about
an
employer's
individual
actions
directed
towards
an
individual
employee,
but
in
(a)(2),
we
are
concerned
with
an
employer's
macro-actions
directed
towards
its
employees
and
how
that
impacts
individuals.
mr.
john
crabtree
no,
your
honor.
we
don't
believe
it
does
and
i'll
explain
why.
when
you
look
at
(a)(2),
the
clause
because
of
such
individual's
age,
the
word
individual
is
critical
because
at
the
beginning
of
two,
it
reads,
to
limit,
segregate
or
classify
his
employees
in
any
way
which
would
deprive
or
tend
to
deprive
any
individual
of
employment
opportunities
or
otherwise
adversely
affect
his
status
as
an
employee
because
of
such
individual's
age.
so
the
clause
relates
to
the
effect
and
not
to
the
motive
of
the
actor.
mr.
john
crabtree
it
cannot,
your
honor,
because
the
word
his
employees
follows
those
words.
mr.
john
crabtree
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
of
course,
congress
has
never
acted
to
expressly
prohibit
disparate
impact
under
title
vii.
the
only
prohibition
of
disparate
impact
under
title
vii
is
in
its
age
as
the
court
construes
in
griggs
and
griggs'
progeny.
mr.
john
crabtree
oh,
it
did
not.
mr.
john
crabtree
it
was
before,
your
honor.
it
certainly
was.
however--
mr.
john
crabtree
--that's
correct.
and
to
hold
that
this
language
does
not
prohibit
disparate
impact
would
mean
that
there
was
no
disparate
impact
under
title
vii.
even
in
a
1991
civil
rights
act,
all
congress
did
was
define
a
defense.
mr.
john
crabtree
if
because
of
did
require
a
bad
purpose,
we
would,
however,
there
is
two
reasons
why
we
can,
why
it
is
not.
one
is
that
the
first
one
is
that
the
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
defense
cannot
make
sense
if
the
prohibitions
only
apply
to
intentional
actions.
mr.
john
crabtree
again,
we
are
relating
because
of
back
to
the
effect
of
the
individual
and
we
are
relying
upon
the
court's
interpretation
of
that
language
in
griggs.
mr.
john
crabtree
that
might
make
sense.
i
would
agree,
your
honor,
however
we
don't
believe
there
is
any
basis
to
distinguish
here
given
the
court's
subsequent
cases
post-griggs.
mr.
john
crabtree
your
honor,
two
answers.
first
of
all,
that
we
equate
reduction
in
force
to
a
test.
it's
a
selection
process.
we
are
not
challenging
a
question
on
the
test.
we
are
challenging
the
test
itself.
but
even
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
we
have
inadequately
identified
the
action
of
the
employer
that
should
be
subject
to
disparate
impact
analysis,
we
would
still,
it's
an
interlocutory
proceeding.
we
would
be
happy
to
proceed
on
the
theory
as
the
court
redefines
or
the
court
defines
disparate
impact
under
the
adea.
we
would
amend
our
complaint
in
accordance
with
the
court's
ruling.
mr.
john
crabtree
the
reason
why
we
believe
it's
important
to
be
able
to
do
the
analysis
with
the
reduction
of
force
being
the
action
is
because
otherwise
it
would
allow
an
employer
to
purposely
choose
to
do
a
reduction
in
force
to
get
rid
of
its
older
workers
where
there
is
a
corporate
culture
pervaded
by
ageism
and
have
consequences
as
it
did
here
where
it
greatly
reduced
the
age
of
its
work
force.
mr.
john
crabtree
there
are
cases
dealing
with
reduction
of
force
under
title
vii.
there
is
one
naacp
vs.
medical
center,
inc.,
it
was
out
of
the
third
circuit.
657
f.
2d
1322.
there
have
probably
been
others.
mr.
john
crabtree
candidly,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
recall.
mr.
john
crabtree
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
crabtree
well,
in
most
instances,
employer
is
going
to
be
able
to
explain
why
he
engages
in
any
selection
of
process.
mr.
john
crabtree
and
that
may
very
well
be
why
congress
chose
to
use
the
result
factors
other
than
age
language,
and
that
is
why
there
are,
although
we
don't
agree
with
them,
why
there
were
good
intellectual
arguments
that
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
is
something
less
than
business
necessity.
that
it
is
easier
to
justify.
mr.
john
crabtree
we
believe
that
the
term
is
ambiguous.
and
we
believe
for
that
reason
the
court
should
defer
interpretation.
mr.
john
crabtree
that
it
is
that
the
employer
must
justify
the
action
as
being
business
necessity.
mr.
john
crabtree
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
john
crabtree
but
if
the
employer
must
only
show
that
its
action
was
reasonable,
it
is
not
as
demanding
as
showing
that
it
was
necessary.
mr.
john
crabtree
it
is
still
a
burden
on
him.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
crabtree
they
don't
make
sense
on
the
mixed
motive
analysis
because
in
the
mixed
motive
analysis
there
is
still
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
employer's
illegal
motive
caused
an
illegal
action.
in
a,
if
a
statute,
it
provides
that
the
action
is
otherwise
prohibitive,
so
you
already
have
an
action
that
is
itself
a
violation
of
the
act
but-for
the
defense
that
follows.
we
don't
have
the
same
concerns
we
have
in
a
mixed
motive
case
where
we
don't
know
if
the
motive
of
the
employer
actually
caused
the
action.
it's
already
been
determined
as
a
premise
of
the
defense.
there
is
an
additional
reason
why
we
believe
that
the
court
should
hold
that
disparate
impact
applies
under
the
adea.
and
that
is
congress
passed
the
owbpa
and
provided
that
employees
who
were
terminated
in
reductions
in
force
should
be
entitled
to,
were
entitled
to
receive
physical
information
prior
to
deciding
whether
or
not
to
take
the
termination
package,
presumably
of
substantial
economic
value,
or
take
their
chances
in
litigation.
given
that
disparate
treatment
can
generally
not
be
predicated
upon
nothing
more
than
statistics.
and
given
that
employees
terminated
in
rif's
usually
do
not
have
an
independent
basis
to
suspect
that
they
are
being
singled
out
for
discrimination.
mr.
john
crabtree
well,
when
you
are
observing
the
terms
of
a
seniority
system,
you
know,
you
may
be
looking
at
age
directly.
you
may
have,
you
can
easily
have
a
violation
that
exists
under
the
act
otherwise.
mr.
john
crabtree
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
don't
have
an
answer
to
that.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
can
disregard
the
words
of
the
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
we
can
ignore
the
term
reasonable
factors,
and
when
you
look
at,
at
(f)(1),
and
you
look--
mr.
john
crabtree
--you
might
be
able
to
make
that
argument,
but
it
is
not
the
most
logical
argument.
it
does
not
respect
congress'
words.
it
does
not
respect
the
fact
that
congress
required
that
the
factors
not
just
be
neutral,
but
that
it
be
reasonable
because
even
if
we
ignored
the
otherwise
prohibitive
language,
justice
scalia,
we
still
have
to
give
effect
to
the
term
reasonable.
congress
not
merely
require
that
the
factors
exist
or
that
they
be
legitimate
or
bonafide
as
in
the
epa
or
as
gunther
acknowledged,
but
that
they
be
reasonable
as
well.
mr.
john
crabtree
that's
certainly
true,
justice
kennedy.
there
are
subtle
biases
and
that's
what
the
secretary
ward's
report
acknowledged
and
that's
what
the
court
acknowledged
in
hazen
paper
when
it
says
that
subtle
biases,
stereotypes
are
largely
an
issue,
not
animus
in
age
discrimination
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
court's
holding
in
watson
that
disparate
impact
exists
largely
to
detect
subtle
biases.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
john
crabtree
thank
you,
your
honor.
justice
scalia,
you
asked
earlier
why
we
should
not
construe
the
good
cause
provision
as
just
something
similar
to
the
reasonable
factors
provision.
the
difference
is
the
absence
of
the
words
otherwise
prohibited.
the
same
words
that
did
not
exist
in
f
2
when
betts
was
decided.
without
the
words
otherwise
prohibited,
there
would
be
a
good
argument
that
the
reasonable
factors
defense
was
not
a
defense.
but
because
of
those
two
critical
words,
it
is
inescapable
that
there
has
already
been
a
violation
of
the
act.
second,
fogerty
was
a
copyright
case,
not
another
discrimination
case
in
trying
to
import
the
attorneys
fee
provision,
prevailing
party
fee
provision
in
that
case
did
not
make
sense
as
it
does
here
because
the
adea
in
title
vii
share
a
common
purpose
and
the
common
legislative
history
and
the
common
language.
in
gunther,
the
court
did
not
hold
that
there
was
not
disparate
impact
for
a
wage
disparities
under
title
vii.
what
the
court
held
was
that
the
defense
was
any
other
factor
and
that
that
applied
or
suggested
that
it
might
apply
in
a
facially
neutral
practice.
but
the
court
also
said
in
gunther
that
the,
that
the
defendant,
improving
its
defense,
must
establish
that
factors
were
legitimate
and
bonafide.
here,
of
course,
we
have
the
additional
word
reasonable
so
mere
legitimacy,
or
merely
being
bonafide
cannot
be
enough.
while
the,
as
counsel
conceded
in
mixed
motive
cases,
the
court's
analysis
is
whether
or
not
but-for,
the
but-for
analysis
must
be
connected
and
whether
or
not
the
employer's
motives
caused
the
employer's
action
is
at
issue.
and
again,
going
back
to
the
words
otherwise
prohibited,
we
don't
have
that
under
the
reasonable
factors
defense
for
the
adea.
i
have
no
more
to
offer.
mr.
john
crabtree
thank
you
very
much.
