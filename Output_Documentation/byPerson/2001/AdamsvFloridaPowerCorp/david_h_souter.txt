okay,
but
that
argument
is
equally
compatible
with
the
position
that
your
brother
is
taking
on
the
other
side,
and
if
you
take
the
ambiguity
that
is
left,
and
you
combine
it
with
the
argument
that
justice
ginsburg
is
making
about
the
parallel
language
with
title
vii,
doesn't
it
lead
you
to
say
all
right,
the
parallel
language
is
answered
only
by
an
argument
which
in
fact
is,
boils
down
to
an
ambiguity
and
an
ambiguity
doesn't
defeat
the
policy
of
construing
like
statutes,
like
drafted
statutes
in
a
like
manner.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
really
understand...
i
must
say,
i
don't
entirely
follow
the
argument.
supposing
you
have
a
test
that
you
have
to
have
an
iq
above
110,
something
or
other,
in
order
to
avoid
discharge,
and
you
find
that
that
has
a
disparate
impact
on
older
workers
for
some
reason,
they
lose
their
intelligence
quota
or
something
like
that.
beyond
the
age.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
why
is
that
necessary
to
deal
with
mixed
motive?
why
can't
you
recognize
mixed
motive
by
recognized
unreasonable
factors
other
than
age?
that's
an
equally
mixed
motive,
if
you
would
have
an
unreasonable
factor.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what,
what
does
seem
to
weaken
the
argument
is
leaving
even
aside
the
mixed
motive
argument,
you
were,
you
are
arguing
that
a
reasonable
factor
test
is
proof
that
in
fact
it
was
a,
an,
a
malicious
motive-based
liability
in
the
first
place.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
are
saying,
if
that
is
true,
then
any
motive
other
than
the
proscribed
one
is
going
to
defeat
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
odd
thing
is
that
you
are
saying
that
by
specifying
a
reasonable
factor
defense,
congress
was
indicating
that
there
would
be
an
unreasonable
factor
defense
because
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
if
it's
not
age,
there
is
no
liability.
and
that
it
seems
to
me
is
an
odd
argument
to
say
that
by
putting
in
the
word
reasonable
they
are,
they
are
in
effect
confirming
that
an
unreasonable
defense
would
be
equally
good.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you
really
held
that
reason.
in
other
words,
the
reasonableness
of
the,
of
the
employer's
alleged
motive
goes
somehow
to
the
credibility
of
the
employer's
argument
that
it
was
his
motive,
is
that
what
you
are
getting
at?
justice
david
h.
souter
as
an
evidentiary
point,
i
see
it.
as
a
logical
point
for
defining
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
clear.
