well,
the
background
in
griggs
was
racial
discrimination,
and
the
policies
there
seem
to
me
to
rest
on
a
long
history
of
societal
and
historical
bias
against
black
people.
now,
we
don't
have
that
background
with
age
discrimination,
do
we?

so
it
might
be
quite
a
different
proposition
here.

even
though
the
language
is
essentially
the
same?
