you
you
started
out
by
by
referring
to
to
maintain
as
implying
some
significant
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
would
be
consistent
with
that
argument
that
you
say,
well,
a
teacher's
grade
book
is
kept
for
the
year,
but
it
doesn't
become
normally
part
of
the
institutional
records
of
the
school,
so
it's
not
maintained
for
a
substantial
enough
period
of
time
to
qualify,
whereas,
and
i
just
don't
know
factually
about
this,
maybe
the
guidance
counselor's
records
are
simply
kept
forever.
justice
david
h.
souter
maintain,
then,
that
you're
using?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
don't,
doesn't
that
force
us
into
some
kind
of
a
durational,
and
i'm
not
saying
this
is
an
objection
to
your
argument,
particularly,
but
i
mean,
doesn't
this
force
us
into
some
kind
of
a
of
of
a
durational
criterion?
the
the
the
record
of
the
of
the
quiz
which
student
a
corrects
for
student
b
and
calls
out
to
the
teacher,
the
the
the
number
that
student
b
puts
on
top
of
the
the
quiz
is
a
record
for
a
short
period
of
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
something
is
recorded,
and
you're
saying,
well,
sure,
they
they
can't
be
getting
at
that,
but
if
they're
not
getting
at
that,
then
it's
either
got
to
be
for
one
of
two
reasons,
either
the
the
kid
who
does
the
correction
isn't
a
person
who
maintain-,
who
who
makes
a
record
by
definition...
justice
david
h.
souter
or
a
record
is
something
that
has
got
to
be
maintained
longer
than
the
period
that
it
takes
for
some
kid
to
call
a
number
out
to
the
teacher,
which
is
a
durational
criteri-
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think,
saying
that
the
that
the
disclosure
has
got
to
be
of
the
record,
not
merely
of
information
that
may
ultimately
end
up...
justice
david
h.
souter
if,
even
if
we,
we
take
the
the
expansive
definition
that
you
would
use,
what
is
your
response
to
the
point
that
came
out
in
in
my
exchange
with
mr.
kneedler,
that
the
that
the
mere
disclosure
of
information,
which
may
ultimately
end
up
in
a
record,
but
a
disclosure
before
that
information
is,
in
fact,
recorded
would
not
be
prohibited
by
the
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you,
d-
i
don't
want
to
cut
off
your
answer
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
the
assumption
is
it
may
well
make
it
into.
justice
david
h.
souter
whether
there's
a
statute
that
covers
that,
and
we've
got
a
statute
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
speaks,
nothing
has
been
written
yet.
