mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
congress,
in
enacting
the
family
educational
rights
and
privacy
act,
intended
to
prohibit
the
common
and
longstanding
practice
of
peer
grading
of
routine
homework
papers,
quizzes,
and
tests.
congress
did
not
intend
ferpa
to
apply
to
such
routine
classroom
activities,
because
congress
was
concerned
only
with
information
that
might
have
a
long-term
negative
impact
on
a
student's
academic
or
career
opportunities.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
we
did
not
raise
that
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
the
the
court
of
appeals
raised
it
sua
sponte,
and
it
has
been
raised
in
amicus
briefs
submitted,
in
fact,
three
amici...
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
candidly,
your
honor,
we
didn't
raise
it
for
a
number
of
reasons.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
well,
in
hi-
i-
i-
in
hindsight
i
would
agree
with
the
court
that
we
should
have
approached
it
a
different
way.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
the
nineteen
eighty-three...
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
that
that's
very
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
a-
and
the
other
factor
i
would
say
is
that
the
two
decisions
that
the
tenth
circuit
cited
from
from
other
courts
of
appeals,
the
only
two
decisions
that
we
were
aware
of
from
the
second
circuit,
the
fay
versus
south
colonie
school
district
decision,
and
from
the
fifth
circuit,
tarka
vers-
versus
cunningham,
both
of
those
courts
of
appeals
had
held
that
ferpa
was
actionable
under
nineteen
eighty-three,
so
again,
we
made...
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
oh,
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
we
didn't
raise
it,
no,
your
honor,
we
didn't.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
any
decisions.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
the
respondent
seems
to
take
the
position,
which
is
contrary
to
what
the
tenth
circuit
said,
the
respondent
seems
to
take
the
position
that
only
e-
records,
only
grades
or
scores
that
are
re-
recorded
in
the
teacher's
grade
book
are
education
records.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
what
congress
was
getting
at
with
the
word
maintained,
it
goes
back
to
what
i
said
in
the
opening
statement,
which
is,
information
that
could
have
a
long-term
effect
on
the
student's
career.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
by
that
argument,
but
congress
was
concerned
about
things
that
would
have
a
long-term
effect.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
no.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
yes.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
well,
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
and
and
that
that,
you're
referring,
i
believe,
to
the
sole
possession
notes...
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
b-
but
that's
not
that's
not
limited
to
grade
books.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
[inaudible]
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
yes.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
i
disagree
that
you...
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
well,
for
instance,
a
document,
a
counseling
record,
for
instance,
perhaps
the
the
student
had
had
experienced
some
emotional
problems,
or...
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
come
to
the
attention
of
a
counselor.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
well,
but
for
that
exception.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
materials
like
that
are
maintained
by
an
educational
agency
or
institution.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
i
believe
t-
because
a
grade
book
is,
in
my
opinion,
your
honor,
more
of
an
evaluation
instrument
rather
than
a
a
record.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
well,
i
i
that
argument
might
very
well
apply
to
counselor's...
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
well,
i
think
that's
an
that's
an
alternative
possibility,
your
honor,
is
that
it's
a
belt
and
suspenders
ap-
approach
that
that
congress
never
intended
grade
books
to
be
covered,
but
just
in
case
somebody
happened
to
to
be
inclined
to
read
them
that
way,
we're
going
to
put
this
exception
in
as
well.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
yes.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
i
not
i-
in
a,
no,
not
a
a
pure
durational
criteria.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
the
definition
of
maintain
that
i
would
ask
the
court
to
adopt
is
its
common
meaning,
to
preserve,
to
retain.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
correct...
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
that
that's
true,
and
and
that's
the
same
reason
that
a
chalkboar-,
work
on
a
chalkboard
would
not
be
maintained
in
the
meaning
of
ferpa,
even
though
it
might
be
up
there
not
only
for
for
a
minute
or
two,
i
mean,
in
some
college...
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
that's
up
there
for
a
week...
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
no,
absolutely
not.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
because
it's
not
an
education
record.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
no,
i
don't
believe,
in
in
the
context
of
pure
grading,
it
would
make
no
sense
to
say
that
one
student,
that
it's
not
a
release
if
if
the
student
grading
the
paper
records
the
grade.
mr.
jerry
a.
richardson
a-
attendance,
well,
again
i
would
say
that
attendance
records
are
not
the
kind
of
information...
