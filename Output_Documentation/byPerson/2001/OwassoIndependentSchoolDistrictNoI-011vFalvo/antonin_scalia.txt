what's
your
definition
of
maintain,
what,
a
week,
a
month
?
justice
antonin
scalia
make
me
an
offer.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
my
colleagues
like
that
stu-
justice
antonin
scalia
if
if
if
your
definition
is
correct,
and
it's
it's
it's
it's
that
limited
that
it's
only
the
stuff
the
school
keeps
that
will
go
on
into
the
permanent
record
of
the
student,
what
would
be
the
reason
for
that
exception
that
the
statute
contains
for,
you
know,
personal
notes
that
a
teacher
that
a
teacher
makes?
you
wouldn't
need
that
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
w-
where
is
it?
c-
can
we
look
at
that?
it's
in
the,
w-
what's
the
sect-
justice
antonin
scalia
appendix
page
four
of
your
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
my
point
is,
you
wouldn't
need
that
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
if,
i
mean,
that
e-
that
e-
that
exception
suggests
that
other
things
that
are
only,
only
held
b-
in
the
sole
possession
of
the
maker...
justice
antonin
scalia
could
could
be
within
within
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
come
within
your
definition
of
permanent
records,
the
kind
of
things
that
go
on
to
to
college
admissions
offices,
and
so
forth?
that's
what
i
thought
you
were
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
the
notes,
personal
notes
kept
by
a
by
a
counselor
come,
would
come
within
this
statute
but
for
that
exception,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
ste-
so
are
a
teacher's
grade
books.
justice
antonin
scalia
notes
aren't?
the
counselor's
notes
aren't?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
usually
don't
interpret
statutes
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
does
the
act
cover
a
teacher's
grade
book
that
she
keeps
during
the
term?
justice
antonin
scalia
results
of
the
exam,
you
know,
the
big
exam,
mid-term
exam,
and
the
stee-
student
you
know
posts
this
the
results
on
the
board.
justice
antonin
scalia
posts
it
before
he
sends
it
on
to
the
to
the
administration
office...
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
you
you
you
said
it
doesn't
include
the
the
the
teacher's
classroom
records.
justice
antonin
scalia
possession
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
sole
possession
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means
it
it
would
have
been
embraced
by
the
statute,
but
for
that...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
cau-
is
the
calling
out
a
record?
what
what
does
the
record
consist
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
record?
i
mean,
it
it
d-
d-
does...
justice
antonin
scalia
records,
files,
documents,
and
other
materials.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
grade
is
not
a
record,
file,
document,
or
other
material.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i
say,
a.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh
oh,
after
you
write
it
down,
maybe
when
the
teacher
writes
it
down,
a-
at
most
when
the
teacher
writes
it
down
in
her
grade
book,
you
say
it,
it
then
becomes
a
record.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
the
information
before
it
becomes
a,
before
it
becomes
a
record,
because
it
doesn't
become
a
record
until
the
child
says
it,
and
then
the
teacher
writes
it
down.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
from
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
illogical,
but
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
statute
that,
that
prohibits
it,
anymore,
it
you
could
say
it's
just
as
illogical
to
prohibit
the
teacher
from
disclosing
that
information,
but
if
somebody
else
happens
to
know
it,
for
that
person
to
be
perfectly
free
to
say,
you
know,
jack
smith's
kid
got
a
d
in
that
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
in
the
grade
book
yet.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
teacher
is
making
the
record
after
the
child
says,
a.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
so,
do
we
think
that
the
congress
agreed
with
senator
buckley?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
especially
especially
mean
with
respect
to
this
special
e-
e-
special
ed
student
who's
being
mainstreamed.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what
you
mean
by
a
special
aid
student,
a
student
who
is
receiving
forty-five
minutes
of
speech
therapy
once
a
once
a
week?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
you
mean
by
a
special
special
ed...
justice
antonin
scalia
forty-five
minutes
a
week.
justice
antonin
scalia
speech
therapy
help
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
paint
your
client
as
more
sympathetic
than
he
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
no
right
to
keep
the
information
confidential.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
records.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
need
two
cheaters
for
that
to
work,
whereas
if
you
grade
your
own
paper,
it
only
takes
one.
