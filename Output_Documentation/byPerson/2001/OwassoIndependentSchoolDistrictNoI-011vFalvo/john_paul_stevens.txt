concede,
or
do
you
not,
that
the
announcement
by
one
student
of
another
student's
grades
within
the
classroom
and
not
outside
the
classroom
is
a
release
of
information
within
b
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
it
was
an
educational
record,
would
you
say
that
it's
a
it's
a
release
b-
when
it's
tol-
when
it's
realvaled
[:
revealed]
by
one
student
to
another
within
the
classroom?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
disclosure
of
information
within
the
classroom
setting
is
a
release
of
education
records
within
the
meaning
of
of
of
b
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
say
that
if
if
it
has
the
more
formal
concern
about
release
to
the
public
and
law
enforcement
and
so
forth?
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
an
awful
lot
of
information
about
special
students
and
others
that
that
the
that
that
the
student's
classmates
are
inevitably
going
to
learn
about
just
by
being
in
class
seeing
what
goes
on
in
class.
