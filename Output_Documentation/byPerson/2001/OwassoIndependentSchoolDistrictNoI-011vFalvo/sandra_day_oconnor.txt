mister...
did
you

the
court
of
appeals
discussed
it.

o'connor
raise
the
issue?
why
isn't
that
more
important
than
what
you
did
raise?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they're
hard
for
us,
too.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
we
think
there's
a
real
problem
with
that
notion
under
this
scheme,
where
the
whole
object
was
to
have
it
administratively
determined
and
it
was
a
funding
mechanism,
and
under
the
act,
the
penalty
for
not
following
it
is
a
cut-off
of
funding.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
send
it
back...
justice
sandra

o'connor
let
it
be
briefed
and
argued
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
dealing
with
here?
you
don't
have
much
time,
and
i
am
concerned.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
your
succinct
explanation
of
why
it's
not
covered
by
the
statu-
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
maintained,
or
because
it
isn't
a
record?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it's
an
educational
record
as
defined
under
the
act
and
maintained
as
such,
and
that's
really
the
issue,
whether
it
it's
covered
at
this
stage
of
a
fellow
student
calling
out
a
grade.
justice
sandra

o'connor
but
that
is
not
the
text
of
the
statute.
