about
how
this
act
is
enforced
on
the
federal
side?
have
there
been
any
fund
terminations,
because
the
only
thing
in
the
statute
itself
is
fund
termination,
isn't
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
difference
between
your
position
and
the
government
said,
but
it
means,
educational
records
means
institutional...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
kind
that
would
be
in
the
principal's
office
or
and
not
in
the
teacher's
drawer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
been
the
posi-
position
that
the
government,
that
this
fpco
has
taken
consistently,
because
wasn't
there,
didn't
they
say
that
the
teacher's
grade
book...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
an
educational
record?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
do
you
have
a
position
on
the
threshold
question?
is
there
a
claim
for
relief,
a
private
claim
for
relief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
gives
the
individual
parent
a
veto,
and
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
any
parent
can
make
the
rules
for
that
parent's
child,
what
that
parent
wants
them
to
be,
not
the
teacher,
not
the
school
district.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
senator
buckley
meant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
long
as
the
teacher
records
them,
you
say
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
answer
to
that?
pos-
is
it,
is
it
the
teacher
gives
a
quiz,
has
the
grades
called
out,
but
doesn't
record
in
her
grade
book.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
she
says,
class,
i
want
to
give
you
an
incentive
to
do
better,
so
i'm
going
to
write
down
these
grades
but
i'm
going
to
discount
at
the
end
of
the
term
i'm
going
to
discount
the
lower
two-thirds
of
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
goes
all
the
way
through,
i-
i
take
it,
in
your
view
that
th-
co-
take
a
college
student.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
it's
a
technique
that
teachers
do
use,
to
have
students
do
prepare
and
present
each
other's
papers,
that
that's
a
a
technique
that's
quite
common
in
colleges
and
professional
schools.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
teacher
writes
down
in
the
book
the
comments
that
the
students
made
and
she
takes
that
into
account
in
the
final
grade
in
the
course.
