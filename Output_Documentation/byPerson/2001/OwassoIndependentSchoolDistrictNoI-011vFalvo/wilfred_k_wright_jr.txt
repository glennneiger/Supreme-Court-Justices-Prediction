mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
under
the
facts
of
this
particular...
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
not
that
particular
action,
but
that
would
be
a
consequence
of,
of
finding
that
the
education
records
would
be
just
a
permanent...
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
contrary,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
teachers,
not
only
in
this
particular
case,
but
in
many
cases,
especially
in
the
kreb-,
the
krebs
versus
the
rutgers
university
case,
were
disclosing
exam
scores...
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
no.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
here
we
have
a
situation,
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
happened
simultaneously.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
if
it
doesn't
make
it
into
the
teacher's
maintenance
of...
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
i
believe
that
the
teacher
is
disclosing
the
information
that
she
is
intending
to
collect.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
no.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
gathering
the
information.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
documents,
something...
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
the
grade.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
and
i
write
it
down
as
you
shout
it
out.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
that
is
the
record
that
has
been
disclosed
because
the
teacher
is
making
the
record.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
if
she's
collecting
it,
yes.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
b
one.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
if
a
teacher
has
a
legal
obligation
to
protect
the
information
in
the
grade
book,
if
the
grade
book
is
an
education
record...
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
she's
making
the
record.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
the
record.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
that
is
true.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
the
socratic
method
is
not
forbidden,
your
honor.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
if
she's
making
a
record,
i
would
say
that
would
be
a...
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
no.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
under
your...
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
violation,
but
it's
not
under
the
statute.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
that's
correct,
because
in
answer
to
to
to
justice
breyer,
senator
buckley
specifically
stated,
some
may
argue
that
my
amendment
will
create
too
much
additional
work
and
red
tape.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
he's
intending
to
give
the
parent
the
right
to
consent
to
the
release
of
information.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
senator
buckley
said
another
statement.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
yes,
with
respect
to
education
records,
that
is
correct,
especially
scores
on
exams.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
that's
possibly
true,
but
there
other
means.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
if
she's
not
recording
it
in
her
grade
book,
that
is
not
a
violation.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
it's
an
education
record.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
within
the
meaning
of
b
one...
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
our
interpretation
is
it
has
to
be.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
that
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
the
grade
that's
going
in
the
grade
book
is
a
release,
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
yes.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
he
was.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
no.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
i
am
just
trying
to
be
sensitive
not
only
to
just
that
one
child,
but
even
to
her
other
children
who
are
also
part
of
this
case
with
respect
to
their
a's.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
it's
covered
because
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
teacher
is
using
that
protocol
to
collect...
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
the
literal
language
interpreted
in
the
context
of
the
parent's
right
to
consent,
in
other
words,
keeping
that
information
confidential.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
i
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
she's
making
the
record.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
interpreted
in
the
context
of
what
we're
doing
here.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
congress
intended
that...
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
the
line
is
the
grade
that
is
going
in
the
grade
book
with
respect
to
this
particular
case.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
it
would
be
terrible.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
you're
referring
to
the
the
the
teacher
assistant
helping
them
gra-
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
okay.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
outside
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
may
be
a
violation
if,
in
fact,
she's
making
a
record
and
that
was
the
intent
of
the
teacher
to
make
a
record.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
i
think
the
funds
need
to
be
available
under
an
applicable
program,
and
i
think
the
lower
cases
have
have
deemed
that
certain
programs
are
applicable
and
certain
others
are
not.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
i
cross
examined
the
principal
with
respect
to
that
particular
issue,
and
he
said,
well,
we
exchange
papers
because
the
students
cheat.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
we
believe
that
the
the
the
plain
language
governs
what
is
an
educational
record
and
it
does
not
mean
the
permanent
transcript.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
that
never
happened.
mr.
wilfred
k.
wright,
jr.
that
isn't
what
happened
here,
but
that
has
happened,
your
honor.
