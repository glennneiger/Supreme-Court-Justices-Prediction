well,

no

the

a
a

su-

that
a
school

received
a

a

in
in
federal

and
this

justice

the
respondent’s
children
are
enrolled
in
the
owasso
school
district
which
is
in
a
suburb
of
tulsa,
oklahoma
and
the
teachers
there
sometimes
asked
the
students
to
score
each
other’s
papers
and
assignments
as
the
teacher
explains
the
correct
answers
to
the
entire
class
and
this
is
called
peer
grading
where
the
students
grade
each
other’s
papers.
now,
the
respondent,
the
parents,
claim
that
peer
grading
violates
a
federal
statute
which
is
called
the
family
educational
rights
and
privacy
act
of
1974
and
the
act
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
ferpa.
asserting
the
violation
of
the
act,
the
parents
filed
a
1983
action
against
the
school
district
and
other
school
officials.
the
act
authorizes
federal
funds
to
be
withheld
from
school
district
that
permits
student’s
education
records
or
the
information
contain
in
the
record
to
be
released
without
the
parent’s
written
consent.
at
the
offset
we
note
that
as
an
open
question
whether
the
act
provides
private
parties
like
these
parents
with
a
cause
of
action
enforceable
in
the
1983
and
we
have
granted
certiorari
on
this
issue
in
another
case
which
we
will
hear
later
this
term.
for
purposes
of
the
present
case,
the
court
assumes
without
deciding
that
ferpa
provides
private
parties
like
the
parents
with
a
cause
of
action
enforceable
under
1983.
the
question
now
is
do
they
prevail
in
saying
that
this
peer
grading
mechanisms
are
a
violation
of
the
act.
the
school
district
and
the
united
states
contain
that
education
records
include
only
institutional
records
like
student
grade
point,
averages,
standardized
test
scores,
and
the
records
of
disciplinary
actions,
but
the
parents
adapting
the
tenth
circuit
reasoning
contend
the
teachers
grade
books
and
the
grades
within
are
maintained
by
the
teacher,
and
thus
covered
by
the
act
and
the
court
of
appeals
reasoned
that
if
the
teacher
cannot
disclose
the
grades
once
they
are
written
in
the
grade
book
it
makes
no
sense
to
permit
the
disclosure
immediately
beforehand.
so
the
court
thus
held
and
the
parents
agree
that
student
graders
maintain
the
grades
under
the
act
until
they
are
reported
to
the
teacher
so
they
cannot
be
disclosed.
two
statutory
indicators
show
that
the
tenth
circuit
aired:
first,
student
papers
are
maintained
by
the
student
graders
in
their
view
and
we
conclude
that
this
is
incorrect.
the
word
"maintain"
suggests
ferpa
records
will
be
kept
in
a
filing
cabinet
in
a
records
room
at
the
school
or
in
a
permanent
secured
database.
perhaps
even
after
the
student
is
no
longer
enrolled,
the
student
graders
only
handle
assignments
for
a
few
minutes
as
the
teacher
calls
out
the
answers.
second,
a
student
grader
is
not
a
person
acting
for
an
educational
institution,
that
phrase
connotes
agents
of
the
school.
just
as
it
would
be
awkward
to
say
students
are
acting
for
the
institution
when
they
follow
their
teacher’s
instruction
to
take
a
quiz,
it
is
equally
awkward
to
say
that
they
are
acting
for
the
institution
when
following
their
teacher’s
directions
to
score
the
paper.
correcting
a
classmate’s
work
can
be
as
much
a
part
of
the
assignment
as
taking
the
test
itself.
it
is
a
way
to
teach
material
again
in
a
new
context
and
it
helps
show
students
how
to
assist
and
respect
fellow
pupils.
by
explaining
the
answers
of
the
class
as
the
students
correct
the
papers,
the
teacher
not
only
reinforces
the
lesson
but
also
discovers
whether
the
students
have
understood
the
material
and
are
ready
to
move
on.
we
do
not
think
ferpa
prohibits
these
educational
techniques.
respondent’s
construction
of
the
term
education
records
to
cover
student
homework
or
classroom
work
would
impose
substantial
burdens
on
teachers
across
the
country.
it
would
force
all
instructors
to
take
time
which
otherwise
could
be
spent
teaching
and
in
preparation
to
correct
an
assortment
of
daily
student
assignments.
respondent’s
view
would
make
it
much
more
difficult
for
teachers
to
give
the
students
immediate
guidance.
indeed,
the
logical
consequences
of
the
respondents,
arguments
are
all
but
unbounded
at
oral
argument
counsel
for
the
respondents
seem
to
agree
that
if
a
teacher
in
any
of
the
thousands
of
classrooms
in
the
nation
covered
by
this
act
puts
a
happy
face
or
a
gold
star
or
disapproving
remark
on
a
classroom
assignment,
federal
law
does
not
allow
other
students
to
see
it.
with
that
congress
meant
to
intervene
in
this
drastic
fashion
which
traditional
state
functions.
under
the
court
of
appeals’
interpretation
of
ferpa
the
federal
power
would
exercise
minute
control
over
specific
teaching
methods
and
instruction
on
dynamics
and
classrooms
throughout
this
country,
the
congress
does
not
likely
to
have
mandated
this
result
and
we
do
not
interpret
the
stature
to
require
it.
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
is
reversed
and
remanded.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
