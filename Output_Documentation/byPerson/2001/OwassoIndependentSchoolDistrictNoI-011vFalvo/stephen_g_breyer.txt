i'm
slightly
worried
about
that,
because
suppose
that,
i
take
it
attendance
records
are
are
are
also,
they
are
probably
are
maintained,
and
they
are
records,
aren't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
i
the
more
i
hear,
i'm,
a
little
there
used
to
be
schools
in
any
case
that
would
say,
the
following
ten
percent
of
the
class
graduates
with
honors,
next
forty
percent,
okay,
and
sort
of
honors,
and
the
last
sixty
percent,
well,
they
graduated,
didn't
they.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
all
forbidden
now?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
a
child
who,
i
remember
in
my
third
grade,
my
teacher,
who
thought
it
was
her
job
to
teach,
had
problems
sometimes
with
discipline.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
use
my
examples.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
example?
i'd
i'd
like
an
answer
to
that
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
next
question
is
each
morning
we
came
in
and
said,
present
or
here,
and
she'd
keep
a
record.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
don't
go
through
the
procedures.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
didn't
they
th-
the
teacher
doesn't
announce
to
every
parent,
now
we
want
to
have
a
hearing
for
you
to
see
whether
we
say
to
your
child,
here
or
not
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
be
a
violation
in
your
view
on
the
same...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
disciplinary
purposes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
don't
agree
with
you
on
this
and
i
thought
my
examples
that
i
gave
are
extreme
instances,
and
it
doesn't
cover
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
way
out-of-date
probably,
but
a-
when
i,
again,
when
i
used
to
be
in
school,
grades
were
thought
of,
to
some
degree,
as
an
incentive,
that
they
weren't
totally
private.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
in
the
absence
of
some
other
line,
i
might
tend
to
think
a
line
should
be
drawn
to
give
the
teacher
maximum
freedom
to
run
his
or
her
class
the
way
the
teacher
feels
is
best
educationally.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
if
you
could?
suppose
you
were
to
say
that.
