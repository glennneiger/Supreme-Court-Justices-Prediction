mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
family
e-
educational
rights
and
privacy
act
does
not
prohibit
the
common
classroom
practice
of
s-
one
student
grading
another
student's
paper,
or
other
common
classroom
and
teaching
practices.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
a-
it
addresses
the
grade
book,
in
our
view,
by
by
by
including
it,
we
we
think
ordinarily
it
would
come
within
the
sole
possession
e-
exception
in
in
the
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
i
i
think
under
the
position
we've
espoused
here,
that
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i-
if
it's
posted,
and
this
may
sound
technical,
but
this
is
this
is
where
this
is
where
the
two
categories
we
think
intersect.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
that's
exactly
true,
and
t-
and
there
are
analogous
situations
in
which
that's
true,
for
instance
the
attorney-client
privilege,
that
the
the
attorney
can't
disclose
something
that
he's
learned
from
the
client,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
same
information
in
the
possession
of
the
client...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
all
that
is
strictly
presented
in
this
case
is
the
practice
of
s-
one
student
grading
another's
paper
before
the
before
the
teacher
has
gotten
the
papers
themselves...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there's
no
educational
record
maintained
by
the
school.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
n-
whether
it's
maintained
is
part
of
the
definition
of
educational
record.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
we
do
not
have
a
a
position
on
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
[inaudible]
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
two
different
questions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
that
that's
not
covered.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
probably
true,
but
but
but
it's,
one
thing
to
bear
in
mind
here
is,
this
act
was
passed
in
one
form
early
in
nineteen
seventy-four.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
a
if
a
request
is
made
for
them
they
have
to
be
retained
until
the
until
the
request
is
resolved,
a
request
to
inspect
them,
but
if
there's
if
the
parent
or
student,
adult
student
has
not
requested
it,
there
nothing
in
this
act
requires
the
a-
the
school
district
to
keep
them.
