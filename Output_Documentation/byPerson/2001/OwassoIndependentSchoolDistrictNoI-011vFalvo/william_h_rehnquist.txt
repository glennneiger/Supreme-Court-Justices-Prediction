j.
falvo.
sounds
like
the
school
has
an
alias
mr.
richardson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
had
some
justification
on
the
private
cause
of
action.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sure
that
you're
going
to
prevail
on
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
raise
this
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
though,
did
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
it,
in
the
briefs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
richardson
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
has
that
ever
happened?
had
any
teacher
ever
posted
exam
scores
in
the
local
newspaper?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
any,
any
incident
of
that
sort
that
had
ever
been
called
to
the
attention
of
congress?
i
mean,
was
that
really
what
congress
was
trying
to
prevent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
would
be,
a
a
wa-
the
consequence
you
describe
would
allow
a
teacher
to
do
something
that
no
teacher
has
ever
done.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
were
posting
them
in
newspapers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
i
asked
you
about
because
you
mentioned
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
something
written...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
have
the
student
grade
their
own
paper
might
have
some
problems
with
it
too
that
y-
laughter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
moment
ago,
from
what
you
said,
i
thought
the
school
district
was
telling
her
that
she
couldn't
see
her
children's
grades.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wasn't
what
happened
here,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
no.
