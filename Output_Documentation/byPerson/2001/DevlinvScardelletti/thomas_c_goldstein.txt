mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
the
right
to
take
an
appeal.
over
petitioner's
objections,
the
district
court
confirmed
a
class
action
settlement
that
substantially
reduces
petitioner's
individual
pension.
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
petitioner
nonetheless
may
not
appeal
to
argue
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
rejecting
his
objections.
our
principal
submission
is
that,
as
justice
kennedy
explained
in
oral
argument
in
the
felzen
case,
rule
23
class
members
such
as
petitioner
are
bound
by
the
district
court's
judgment
and
thus
are
parties
to
that
judgment
with
the
right
to
appeal
from
it.
because
the
government,
although
seated
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table,
actually
agrees
with
us
that
class
members
are
bound
by
the
judgment,
that
objector
appeals
identify
important
legal
errors,
and
that
they
also
deter
collusive
settlements,
i
will
leave
to
the
solicitor
general's
representative
any
arguments
to
the
contrary
that
my
friend
mr.
gold
may
make.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
depends
on
what
we
mean
by
bound.
there
are
different,
more
expansive
notions
of
collateral
estoppel
and
res
judicata.
what
i'm
talking
about
here
is
that
the
judgment
operates
directly
upon
the
class
member.
and
let
me
be
clear
that
our
position
is
not
to
move
beyond
that.
our
position
is
not
that
it's
sufficient
to
be
a
party,
but
that
it
is
a
necessary
condition.
it
is
also
necessary,
and
this
is
an
important
point
for
the
distinction
between
appealing
from
an
approved
settlement
and
for
appealing
a
litigated
judgment.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
the
difference
is
that
while
you
can
have
an
application
of
collateral
estoppel
or
res
judicata
that
extinguishes
a
right
to
pursue
an
action,
what
i'm
talking
about
here
and
let
me
put
it
in
very
practical
terms.
the
petitioner
had
a
pension
and
that
pension
went
down
40
percent
when
the
district
court
in
this
case
approved
a
settlement
that
said
the
cola
provisions
of
the
pension
plan
are
null
and
void,
and
that's
the
kind
of
direct
operation
i'm
talking
about.
now,
there
is
an
unsettled
area
of
the
law
stretching
to
precedents
dating
from
the
1850s,
the
so-called
quasi-party
cases.
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
apply
those
here
because
unlike
a
rule
23.1
class
member
in
the
context
of
a
derivative
action,
we
are
directly
bound
by
the
action.
we
are
not
talking
about
extinguishing
a
right
of
ours,
for
example,
to
sue
on
behalf
of
a
corporation.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
that's
a
good
entry
into
the
purpose
and
function
of
rule
23(e).
what
happens
is
that
at
the
point
that
it's
acknowledged
by
the
respondents
here
that
at
the
point
settlement
is
agreed
to,
the
class
representative
and
be
opposing
named
parties
joined
forces
to
oppose
objections,
and
that
continued
at
the
stage
of
the
case
where
you
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
take
an
appeal.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
23(e).
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
would
be
in
the
appendix
of
the
council
of
institutional
investors,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
(a)(4)
of
the
appendix
to
that
brief.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
i'll
read
it
very
briefly
for
the
court's
benefit.
a
class
action
shall
not
be
dismissed
or
compromised
without
the
approval
of
the
court
and
notice
of
the
proposed
dismissal
or
compromise
shall
be
given
to
all
members
of
the
class
in
such
manner
as
the
court
directs.
now,
let
me
detour
for
just
a
moment.
the
court
will
notice
it
noticed
in
the
felzen
case
that
this
rule
doesn't
actually
explicitly
provide
for
objections.
the
advisory
committee
notes
make
clear
that
that
was
the
intent
of
this
provision,
and
in
fact
amended
rule
23(e)
which
will
go
into
effect
next
year
explicitly
provides
for
the
right
to
state
objections.
to
return
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
what
happens
is
that
this
rule
recognizes
that
the
class
representative
is
not
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
objectors
at
the
point
an
objection
is
taken.
they
in
fact
litigate
actively
for
the
settlement.
mr.
gold
here
is
on
behalf
of
the
class
representative
in
this
case
and
goodness
knows,
he
will
argue
that
we
have
no
right
to
take
an
appeal.
the
rule,
23(e),
provides
an
opportunity
for
us
to
come
in,
advise
the
district
court
of
a
problem
with
the
settlement.
our
point
is
that
nothing
in
these
rules
contemplates
that
the
objector's
role
would
be
extinguished
at
the
district
court,
that
someone
uniquely
in
the
context
of
a
class
action,
who
is
bound
directly
by
the
judgment
and
participates
as
of
right
in
the
district
court,
would
only
participate
at
the
district
court.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
we
say
we
do
not
have
to
do
that,
that
there
is
nothing
about
this
court's
precedents--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
let
me,
there
are
two
parts
to
the
question.
the
first
is,
is
it
open
under
the
rules
and
second,
why
wouldn't
it
be
a
good
idea
to
adopt
it
if
it
were?
as
to
the
first,
it
is
not
open
under
the
rules,
and
let
me
take
you
again
to
the
particular
rule
in
question.
that
would
be,
it's
suggested,
rule
23(d)(2),
and
this
rule
says
that
the
district
court
may
in
appropriate
circumstances--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i'm
going
to
read
from
(a)(3)
in
the
carryover
to
(a)(4)
of
the
same
appendix
of
the
council--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--at
the
bottom
of
the
page
d,
orders
and
conduct
of
actions.
your
honors,
it
says
in
the
conduct
of
actions
to
which
this
rule
applies,
the
court
may
make
appropriate
orders
and
then
i'm
going
to
jump
to
2.
this
is
the
suggestion
of
the
other
side:
requiring
for
the
protection
of
the
members
of
a
class
or
otherwise
for
fair
conduct
of
the
action
that
notice
be
given.
so
there
is
a
suggestion,
where
it
follows,
notice
be
given,
and
then
there
is
a
class
that
says...
i'll
just
continue
to
read
it:
in
such
matters
the
court
may
direct
to
some
or
all
members,
of
any
step
in
the
action
or
of
the
proposed
extent
of
the
judgment,
or
of...
and
this
becomes
critical...
the
opportunity
of
members
to
signify
whether
they
consider
the
representation
fair
and
adequate.
and
then
the
clause:
to
intervene
and
present
claims
or
defenses
or
otherwise
come
into
the
action.
our
point
is
as
follows,
or
is
several
fold.
the
first
is
that
this
is
a
different
notice
from
the
23(e)
notice.
this
is
a
discretionary
notice
that
courts
can
employ
in
some
cases,
and
i
think
it
deserves
to
be
emphasized
that
in
the
35
years
since
1966,
not
a
single
court
has
read
this
provision
in
the
way
that's
suggested
by
the
other
side,
that
it's
mandatory
that
there
be
an
intervention
for
a
screening
function.
the
particular
reason
is
that
this
(d)(2)
notice
refers
to
intervening
to
present
claims
or
defenses,
and
that
the
not
what
an
objector
seeks
to
do.
an
objector
says
there
is
a
settlement
on
the
table,
i
have
a
legal
objection
to
it,
it's
either
unlawful,
as
in
amchem,
or
it's
unfair
as
in
this
case,
and
so
it's
a
different
kind
of
intervention.
so
i
don't
think
it's
open
and
no
court
has
ever
suggested
that
it's
how
the
rule
should
be
interpreted.
now,
assume
the
court
disagrees
with
me,
justice
breyer,
why
isn't
it
a
good
idea?
it
doesn't
accomplish
anything.
what
happens
is
this.
you
move
to
intervene,
the
intervention
motion
is
denied,
so
you
appeal
that,
so
you
haven't
really
gained
anything.
what
you
have
done
is
turn
the
objection
into
the
application
of
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
you
just
added
another
layer
on
top
of
it
because
then
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
decide
well,
did
the
judge
get
the
intervention
motion
wrong?
if
that
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
then
we'll
reach
the
merits.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
then
you
haven't
accomplished
anything
either.
all
you
have
done
is
permitted
an
appeal
that
under
our
theory
would
be
permitted
anyway.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
i
had
taken
an
implicit
premise
to
justice
breyer's
question
that
i'll
come
back
to.
this
case
will
illustrate
your
point,
justice
ginsburg.
in
this
case,
we
objected
to
the
settlement.
we
moved
to
intervene.
that
intervention
was
denied.
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
if
that
intervention
is
properly
denied,
and
as
to
our
attempt
to
come
in
and
take
discovery,
disqualify
class
counsel,
that's
not
within
the
question
presented.
it's
not
here
at
the
court.
we
would
not
have
that
power
as
an
objector.
as
an
objector,
we
have
only
the
right
to
pursue
our
individual
objections,
which
is
the
distinction
i
take
it
you
are
drawing.
justice
breyer,
i
took
the
implicit
premise
of
his
question
to
be
well,
why
don't
we
intervene
for
that
limited
purpose?
and
that's
i
think
what
i
took
justice
breyer
to
be
getting
at.
he
is
saying
what's
the
big
deal.
can't
the
district
judge
maybe
help
us
out
in
some
cases
where
we
might
have
a
lot
of
different
objectors
and
give
you
a
limited
intervention
right.
that
is
akin
to
the
rule
that
is
applied
by
the
seventh
circuit,
and
that
is
preserved
by
the
question
presented
within
the
petition.
now,
the
government
adds
a
patina
on
top
of
that
that
justice
breyer
referred
to,
and
that
is
don't
merely
have
pro
forma
intervention,
but
allow
the
district
judge
to
actually
do
something
and
screen
out
the
people
we
don't
want
appealing.
so
i
came
back
to
justice
breyer
and
i
said
i
don't
think
it
will
actually--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
breyer,
let
me
draw
a
distinction.
my
point
is
not
that
in
an
extraordinary
case,
that
a
district
judge
is
faced
with
dozens
upon
dozens
of
objectors;
the
case
has
become
completely
unmanageable;
this
is
an
important
settlement
to
implement
immediately;
that
a
district
court
couldn't
in
that
case
exercise
discretion
under
the
broad
language
of
subsection
23(d).
my
point
is
that
in
the
mine
run
of
class
actions,
in
every
case,
we
don't
need
to
be
doing
this.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
i
believe
that
under
the
language
of
the
rule--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--of
subsection
d,
and
let
me
return
to
the
introductory
clause,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a,
sort
of
the
broad
phrasing
because
we
have
all
kinds
of
class
actions.
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out
we
don't
have
opt
outs
here
but
in
d
3
cases
we
might.
just
in
the
broad
phrasing
in
the
conduct
of
actions
to
which
the
rule
applies,
the
court
may
make
appropriate
orders.
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
very
sympathetic
to
a
district
judge
faced
with
an
extraordinary
circumstance
of
lots
of
adverse
objectors.
but
i
think--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
apologize,
mr.
chief
justice.
no.
what
i'm
reacting
to
is
justice
breyer's
suggestion
that
if
there
are
actually
a
lot
of
objectors
in
the
case,
and
it's
become
a
mess,
we
have
a
district
judge
who
says
look,
what
in
the
world
is
going
to
happen
with
this
case
on
appeal.
i'm
going
to
try
and
help
the
court
of
appeals
out.
my
point
is
that
i
do
believe
that
the
district
judge
in
that
circumstance
would
have
the
discretion
to
say
to
the
intervenors...
excuse
me,
the
objectors,
say
to
the
objectors,
look,
if
you
all
are
going
to
take
an
appeal,
we
are
going
to
have
to
handle
this
here
and
try
and
create
some
organization.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
apologize,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
are
parties.
this
is
a
rule
23
class
action
under
sosna
vs.
iowa.
at
the
point
of
class
certification,
they
have
come,
they
are
both
bound
by
the
judgment
and
they
have
availed
themselves
of
the
court
by
appearing
and
making
an
objection.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
no.
i
think
the
judge
clearly
is
going
to
hear
objections
from
everyone.
the
question
is
is
the
district
judge
going
to
exercise
some
gatekeeping
determination
about
who
goes
up
on
appeal.
but
justice
souter,
i
could
not
agree
more.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
souter,
that
is
our
fundamental
point,
is
that,
let
me
just
distinguish
again
with
the
court
whose
position
is
what.
we
don't
agree
with
this
suggestion.
it
wasn't
employed
here.
we
think
it's
entirely
unnecessary.
i'm
trying
to
achieve--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
souter,
i
agree
with
you.
i
don't
know
exactly
how
this
is
supposed
to
work.
it
has
never
come
up
in
35
years
since
the
rule
was
amended
fundamentally
in
1966.
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
neither
a
federal
district
judge
for
a
state
trial
court
decided
that
he
or
she
was
presented
with
such
an
extraordinary
case.
i
don't
endorse
this
proposal--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
ginsburg,
i
didn't
focus
on
that
word
in
justice
souter's
question.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
so
that's
quite
right.
now,
let
me
just
put
on
the
table,
your
honors,
the
fact
that
we,
here
at
the
supreme
court,
the
brief
suggests
oh,
this
will
be
so
easy.
district
judges
will
always
allow
these
sorts
of
interventions.
this
court's
opinion
in
crown,
cork
&
seal
makes
quite
clear
that
isn't
true.
this
judge
said
look,
here's
what's
happening.
and
this
is
chief
judge
motz
in
our
case,
said,
i'm
not
going
to
let
you
intervene
but
if
i'm
wrong
in
rejecting
your
objections,
you
have
got
an
appeal.
that's
how
it
has
worked
in
several
circuits
without
any
difficulty
at
all,
with
the
court
of
appeals
having
been
confronted
with
any
need
for
the
district
judges
to
act
as
a
gatekeeper.
and
let
me
pick
up,
justice
souter,
if
i
might,
on
the
specific
problem
that
you
identified
and
that
is
the
district
judge
picking
out
one
appellant
versus
another.
there
is
the
grave
difficulty
that
in
one
appellant
goes
up
and
the
others
are
not
permitted
to
intervene
in
appeal,
what
happens
when
that
person
dismisses
their
appeal?
this
is
an
entirely
untested
rule.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
but
it
has
never
happened.
the
courts...
that
there
would
be
that
many
separate
briefs,
for
example,
or
separate
appeals.
let
me
tell
you
how
the
courts
of
appeals
deal
with
this
problem.
they
deal
with
it
here
like
they
do
in
all
multiparty
litigation.
they
require
consolidation.
for
example,
in
the
second
circuit,
there
can
only
be
one
appellant's
brief.
the
people
have
to
get
together.
in
addition,
the
rules
advisory
committee
has
made
a
very
specific
point
that
i
would
like
to
draw
to
the
court's
attention
with
respect
to
the
amended
rule
23(e)
that
will
come
into
place
in
2003,
and
the
court
says
that
once...
and
i
apologize:
the
advisory
committee
note,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
isn't
reproduced
anywhere,
because
it's
a
new
rule
that
will
come
into
play
next
year.
but
the
advisory
committee
writes,
once
an
objector
appeals,
control
of
the
proceeding
lies
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
may
undertake
review
and
approval
of
a
settlement
with
the
objector
perhaps
as
part
of
the
appeal
settlement
procedures
or
may
remand
to
the
district
court
to
take
advantage
of
the
district
court's
familiarity
with
the
action
in
the
settlement.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
built
into
the
process.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
in
excess
of
several
decades,
your
honor,
and
it
stretches
in
the
ninth
circuit
back
to
1979,
for
example.
and
so
let
me
point
to
the
court
the
language
that
is
quoted
against
us
from
another
court
of
appeals
is
the
guthrie
decision
from
the
eleventh
circuit,
1985,
in
which
that
court
predicted
that
there
would
be
administrative
difficulties,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
a
system
that
allowed
objectors
to
appeal.
but
it
has
been
the
rule
in
those
other
courts
that
justice
ginsburg
identified
for
several
decades,
and
they
have
not
complained
a
whit
about
this.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
justice
kennedy.
this
court's
rule
as
i
understand
it
is
that
you
had
to
have
been
a
party
in
the
court
of
appeal,
and
so
the
failure
to
pursue
your
individual
objection
in
the
court
of
appeals
would
require,
would
mean
that
you
drop
out.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
you
are
a
party
to
the
case,
to
the
district
court's
judgment.
that's
correct.
but
this
court's
cert
proceedings
turn
on
not
whether
you
are
a
party
in
the
district
court
but
whether
you
are
a
party
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
can--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
justice
kennedy.
our
point
is
this.
when
you
appeal
as
an
objector,
as
opposed
to
the
class
representative,
you
appeal
in
your
individual
capacity
to
pursue
your
individual
objections.
that
is
our
position
why
the
fourth
circuit
had
it
wrong
in
saying
that
we
were
going
to
take
over
the
case,
usurp
the
role
of
the
class
representative.
that's
not
correct.
we
come
into
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
devlin
does,
on
behalf
of
himself
and
when
his,
he
is
the
only
objector
appellant
that
was
in
the
court.
it
is
true
that
he
represents
an
organization,
but
his
individual
objections
are
the
only
ones
that
are
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
right.
that's
what
rule
23
sets
up.
it
gives
him
a
formal
and
important
role
in
the
process.
and
it's
important
not
to
let
go
of
the
reason
that
exists,
and
that
is
that
the
rules
advisory
committee
notes
that,
and,
understood
that
these
objections
are
an
important
part
of
the
process
of
identifying
legal
errors
as
in
amchem;
deterring
collusive
settlements
is
another
important
role
that
they
further.
let
me
identify
an
additional
difficulty
and
a
reason
why
you
should
not
have
an
intervention
rule,
and
it
applies,
i'm
trying
to
advise
the
court
about
rules
that
intersect
its
decision
and
rules
that
are
going
to
come
into
place
in
2003.
in
2003,
assuming
the
rules
as
proposed
to
be
amended
are
actually
implemented,
there
is
going
to
be
a
real
problem
with
the
respondent's
suggestion
and
opt-outs.
right
now,
in
a
(b)(3)
class
action,
we
don't
have
the
right
to
opt
out,
which
i
think
is
a
point
in
our
favor,
as
justice
ginsburg
noted,
but
in
a
(b)(3)
class
action
you
can
opt
out
at
the
point
of
class
certification.
under
the
amended
rule,
there
is
going
to
be
a
second
opt-out
opportunity
at
the
point
of
settlement.
our
concern
is
that
if
you
tell
an
objector,
your
role
in
the
case
may
be
cut
off,
if
the
district
judge
makes
a
terrible
legal
error,
and
the
district
judge
then
is
a
screen
and
gets
to
decide
whether
or
not
you
are
going
to
get
to
appeal,
all
that
person
is
going
to
do
is
get
out
of
the
case
and
go
litigate
on
their
own
by
opting
out.
the
one
thing
this
court
i
would
hope
doesn't
want
is
to
spread
out
all
the
parties.
the
point
really
is
to
keep
everybody
within
the
individual
judgment.
the
premise
of
the
respondent's
position,
it
seems
to
me,
is
fundamentally
that
we
want
a
class
action
to
be
settled
and
over
with,
just
the
way
a
lawsuit
of
me
against
another
person
would
be
over.
with
respect,
i
think
that
asks
too
much
of
rule
23.
we,
this
is
a
case
involving
hundreds
upon
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
people,
and
it's
not
surprising
that
it
can't
just
be
settled
by
one
person
or
another.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
because
the
judge
already
knows
that.
the
only
people
contemplated
by
the
government's
intervention
proposal
and
screening
function
are
those
who
have
already
stated
objections
at
the
fairness
hearing,
and
we
know
who
those
people
are.
if
they
weren't
members
of
the
class
and
they
weren't
proper
appellants,
we
would
argue
no.
my
point
about
all
the
different
hypotheticals
spun
in
a
couple
of
pages
in
the
government's
brief
where
it
discusses
the
screening
function
is
that
it
doesn't
actually
add
value
and
it
does
create
collateral
litigation.
there
will
be
a
motion
to
intervene;
there
will
be
mandatory
disclosures;
there
will
be
the
opposition
to
the
motion
to
intervene;
it
will
be
litigated
and
then
it
will
appeal.
i
could
see,
if
the
courts
of
appeals
were
actually
experiencing
a
problem,
that
the
advisory
committee
would
revisit
this
issue
and
would
interpose
the
district
judges
as
a
screen,
but
that
hasn't
happened.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
actually
could.
and
it
hasn't.
the
amended
rule
the
advisory
committee
notes,
note
the
circuit
split,
and
suggest--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
think
there
is
one
good
reason
and
that
is
that
the
advisory
committee
goes
through,
in
cycles,
of
course,
it
revisits
particular
rules.
rule
23,
rule
24.
rule
23
we
believe
has
no
role
to
play,
as
justice
souter
suggested,
in
screening
appellants.
that's
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure
and
so
it's
not
surprising
in
amended
rule
23
that
they
didn't
take
this
on.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
gold,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
goldstein,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
could
make
four
points,
please,
about
the
government's
proposal
starting
with
its
applications
to
this
case,
because
justice
stevens
and
justice
ginsburg
wanted
to
know
whether
we
do
here,
assuming
what
happened
in
the
district
court,
assuming
we
were
going
to
adopt
the
government's
position,
the
government
does
not
press,
so
far
as
i
understand,
any
further
whether
or
not
it's
presented
in
this
court.
we
have
the
cert
petition
identifying
the
motion
to
intervene,
the
discussion
of
the
seventh
circuit's
position.
the
question
is
what
we
did
in
the
district
court.
the
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
the
textual
basis
for
the
government's
rule
is
that
under
subsection
(d)(2)
of
rule
23
you
move
to
intervene,
and
the
language
of
the
rule
is
that
the
district
court
can
condition
your
right
to
intervene.
and
justice
ginsburg,
if
you
would
adopt
the
government's
suggestion,
i
think
that's
what
you
would
have
to
say
was
the
appropriate
result
in
this
case,
that
the
district
judge
should
have
seen
our
intervention
motion
and
because
he
clearly
did
believe
we
had
the
right
to
take
an
appeal,
he
should
have
conditioned
it.
so
my
principal
point
is
that
whatever
the
court
does
in
terms
of
its
rule,
we
prevail.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
explain
why
i
disagree.
there
are,
the
cert
petition,
and
i
need
to
distinguish
between
intervention
for
all
purposes
and
intervention
for
purposes
of
taking
an
appeal.
in
the
cert
petition,
the
question
presented
flags
the
fact
that
we
move
to
intervene
and
discusses
at
some
length
the
seventh
circuit's
role
which
we
are
discussing
here
both
in
the
petition
and
in
the
required
brief,
and
to
that
extent
it
clearly--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
kennedy,
the
reason
we
used
that
formulation
is
because
it's
the
formulation
that
the
fourth
circuit
used.
it's
just
picked
up
from
the
court
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
understand.
the
only
other
point,
i
would
make,
mr.
chief
justice,
about
what's
fairly
included
in
the
question
presented
is
i
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
question
as
the
government
frames
it,
which
it
only
could
do
if
it
believed
our
position
was--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
the
second
is,
i'd
like
to
address,
justice
ginsburg,
with
respect,
i
don't
think
that
you
got
a
comforting
answer
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
has
been
a
problem
in
the
second
or
third
circuits,
i.e.,
is
there
a
problem
out
there
that
requires
the
rules
to
be
construed--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--but
they
don't,
justice
breyer.
our
point
is
that
no
circuit
applies
the
government's
rule.
it's
a
little
unfair
to
say
that
i
can't
identify
a
problem
with
their
rule,
since
no
court
has
ever
adopted
or
even
suggested
it.
now,
it
is
a
problem
to
the
extent
that
there
are
circuits
that
require
full
party
intervention.
that
you
have
to
come
in,
you
have
to
be
a
litigant
in
order
to
take
an
appeal.
the
problem
is
not
an
administrative
one
so
much
as
that
it
cuts
off
appeals,
appeals
that
are
perfectly
legitimate.
the
rule
as
we
understand
it
under
this
court's
precedents
is
not
that
only
named
parties
can
take
an
appeal.
that's
why
someone
who
sanctions
can
appeal
and
that's
why
it's
uncontested
that
the
denial
of
our
motion
to
intervene
gives
us
a
right
to
appeal.
it
is
persons
who
are
directly
affected
by
the
judgment,
directly
bound
by
something
that
the
district
court
did,
and
then
what
they
can
do
is
they
can
appeal
to
the
extent
that
the
arguments
that
they
properly
presented
to
the
district
court.
now,
someday,
will
there
be
unusual
class
actions
that
require
a
further
screen?
perhaps.
our
point
is
that
in
an
appropriate
case
a
district
court
could
employ
the
government's
suggestion,
but
why
we
would
want
to
add
the
burden
of
this
intervention
requirement
in
every
single
class
action
in
order
to
avoid
the
hypothetical
possibility,
that
again
has
never
been
suggested
by
any
court,
state
or
federal,
so
far
as
we
or
the
government
have
been
able
to
identify.
the
other
point
i
would
like
to
make,
just
to,
although
again
we
believe
we
prevail
under
the
government's
suggestion,
is
to
take
you
back
to
the
text
that's
supposed
to
require
this
intervention,
and
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
text
is
otherwise.
there
are
two
different
provisions
for
notice
that
we
are
talking
about.
the
one
is
the
d
provision
that
i
quoted
midway
through
the
argument,
and
the
other
is
e,
which
is
the
settlement
notice.
the
point
to
recognize
is
that
under
(d)(2),
which
talks
about
intervening
to
present
claims
or
defenses,
there
is
no
intervention
requirement
when
it
comes
to
presenting
objections.
and
we
are
not
intervening
to
present
any
claims
or
defenses.
there
is
just
no
textual
hook
here.
to
the
extent
the
court
did
want
to
look
at
subsection
d,
with
respect,
we
think
it's
the
end
of
that
clause
that
says
intervene
to
present
claims
or
defenses
or
otherwise
to
come
into
the
case.
there
is
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
rule,
there
is
nothing
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
that
indicates
that
anyone
contemplated
the
intervention
to
appeal.
