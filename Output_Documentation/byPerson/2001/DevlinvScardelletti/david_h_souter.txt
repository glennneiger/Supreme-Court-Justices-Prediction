david
h.
souter
okay.
let's
assume
we
agree
with
you.
what
does
the
judge
then
do?
does
he
say
i'm
going
to
let
x
and
y
speak
for
the
rest
of
you,
and
i
will
not
hear
separate
objections
from
the
others?
justice
david
h.
souter
how...
how
can...
i'm
lost.
how
does
he
exercise
gatekeeping
on
who
appeals?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
are
suggesting
it
as
an
alternative
to
justice
breyer's
suggestion
that
maybe
to
avoid
chaos,
you
ought
to
have
discretionary
intervention,
permissive
intervention,
and
if
you've
got
to
avoid
the
chaos,
then
i
assume
the
judge
has
got
to
be
able
in
effect
to
limit
what
some
parties
objecting
can
do
in
favor
of
what
other
parties,
letting
other
parties
objecting
speak.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
retract
my
adjective.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
you
are
saying
then
is
not
that
he
ceases
to
be
a
party,
that
the
nonobjecting
class
member
ceases
to
be
a
party
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
the
nonobjecting
class
member
has
waived
the
right
to
be
separately
represented
by
himself,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
is
the
practical
difference?
i
mean,
you
take
the
position
that
intervention
is
of
right,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then
the
practical
difference
is
that
if
they
move
to
intervene,
they
simply
have
to
come
physically
before
the
court,
so
the
court
can
flush
out
the
objection,
as
opposed
to
merely
filing
an
objection
saying
i
object
in
which
case
the
court
may
not
see
them?
is
that
the
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
cannot
the
same
thing
be
accomplished
by
saying
flush
out
your
objection?
