justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
bound
because
a
judge
determined
that
you
had
an
adequate
representative.
i
agree
with
you
that
every
person
in
that
class
is
equally
affected
and
indeed
there
is
no
opt
out
of
this
class
that
we
are
dealing
with.
but
the
determination
has
been
made
that
you
are
represented
by
someone
who
is
an
adequate
representative
of
all
members
of
the
class
who
will
fairly
and
adequately
represent
the
class.
so
as
long
as
the
representative
will
fairly
and
adequately
represent
the
class,
why
isn't
it
the
end
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
we,
could
we
go
back
just
one
step.
you
don't
have
to
intervene
to
be
an
objector.
that's
very
clear,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
thought
that
your
basic
argument
was
whatever
your
status
is
in
the
district
court,
that's
what
your
status
is
on
appeal.
if
you
can
go
into
a
district
court,
which
is
extraordinary,
usually
the
district
court
doesn't
let
anybody
come
in
without
having
intervened,
but
to
object
to
a
settlement,
you
don't
have
to
do
anything
except
say
judge,
i'm
an
objector.
you
don't
have
to
be
an
intervenor.
and
i
thought
that
your
basic
argument
was
whatever
status
you
have
in
the
district
court,
that
you
can
come
in
and
object,
then
you
have
that
same
status
on
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein,
i
was
very
surprised
to
hear
you
say
you
agree
with
justice
souter
when
he
used
the
word
permissive
intervention.
i
mean,
even
the
government
agrees
with
you
that
if
you
must
intervene,
you
would
be
an
intervenor
of
right,
not
a
mere
"permissive",
because
you
are
bound
by
the
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how,
in
the
second
and
third
circuits
has,
has
the
procedure
been
you
can
object,
everybody
lets
you
object,
but
you
can
then
appeal
without
having
intervened?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
objection,
of
course
he
couldn't
petition
for
cert
because
all
he
can
do,
he
can't
question
anything
else
in
the
case
except
his
objections
to
the
settlement.
that's
all
he
can
pursue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what's
wrong
with
the
government's
position,
which
is
you
have
the
right
to
intervene
for
purposes
of
appeal?
indeed
you
don't
even
have
to
file
your
motion
to
intervene
until
after
the
settlement
has
been
entered
as
a
judgment
of
the
court.
just
to
make
it
clear
that
you
are
not
someone
who
isn't
even
a
part
of
this
class,
isn't
even
legitimately
part
of
this
class,
you
are
not
just
somebody
that
walked
in
off
the
street.
why
isn't
that
a
problem?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
couldn't
any
member
of
the
class
say
judge,
you
looked
like
a
representative.
i'm
not
adequately
represented
and
at
the
point
at
which
i'm
not
adequately
represented,
i
have
the
right
to
come
in
and
speak
for
myself.
and
isn't
that
exactly
what's
going
on
here?
a
representative
of
my
class
is
fine,
until
the
representative
is
together
in
a
deal
with
the
other
side,
and
at
that
point,
when
i
object
to
the
deal,
i'm
not
adequately
represented.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gold,
may
i
go
back
to
the
statement,
you
said
something,
you
moved
to
intervene.
if
you
have
seen
class
actions
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
third
circuit,
you
can
come
in
and
object
without
intervening.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that,
you
come
in
and
object
and
you
say
i
object
to
the
settlement.
this
representative
is
not
adequate
to
represent
me
to
the
extent
of
the
settlement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
let
me
put
it
in
your
terms,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
30
of
your
brief.
once
a
proposed
settlement
is
reached,
it
is
axiomatic
that
the
named
representative
party
who
has
negotiated
the
settlement
does
not
adequately
represent
either
the
interests
or
the
viewpoint
of
those
class
members
opposed
to
the
settlement.
you
say
it's
axiomatic
and
i
was
just
saying
well,
you
said
yourself
it's
axiomatic
that
they,
the
representative
at
that
point
does
not
adequately
represent
the
class
member
who
is
opposed
to
the
settlement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
somebody
who
was
not
a
member
of
the
class,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
here
you
are
talking
about
members
of
the
class
and
even
in
this
case,
people
who
are
made
to
be
members
of
the
class
even
if
they
don't
want
to
be
because
they
can't
opt
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
don't
want
to
be.
all
they
want
to
do
is
to
say,
as
justice
stevens
suggests,
you
made
the
settlement
deal
and
the
lawyers
are
getting
the
lion's
share
of
it
and
i
want
to
object
to
that,
why
can't
they
say
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we're
are
not
dealing
with
the
merits
of
it.
we
are
dealing
with
first
you
have
a
right
to
come
in
and
object,
and
you
have
agreed
that
you
do
have
a
right
to
come
in
and
object.
now,
the
question
is,
what
more?
and
what
i
took
to
be
the
principal
difference
between
your
position
and
the
government's
is
the
government
is
very
clear
that
there
is
a
right
to
intervene.
the
objector
would
have
a
right
to
intervene
for
the
limited
purpose
of
pursuing
the
appeal.
you
seem
to
hedge
on
it.
first
you
say
it's
axiomatic
that
there
is
a,
no
longer
an
identity
of
interest,
but
then
i
can't
tell,
and
maybe
you
can
tell
me.
the
government
says
of
course
they
have
a
right
to
intervene,
but
we
want
them
to
be
orderly
so
they
make
a
motion,
which
must
be
granted.
what
is
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
understand
the
government
to
say
it
is
intervention
of
right,
not
permissive
intervention?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
gold,
i
really
don't
understand
what
you
are
trying
to
convey
because
there
are
two
kinds
of
intervention,
intervention
of
right
and
permissive
intervention.
intervention
of
right
if
you
meet
the
terms,
and
in
this
case
it
would
be
when
you
claim
an
interest,
which
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
action,
and
you're
so
situated
that
the
disposition
of
the
action
may
as
a
practical
matter
impaired
your
ability
to
protect
your
own
interests.
so
i
give
you
one
example
is,
well,
this
case.
i
will
lose...
my
pension
is
going
to
be,
the
cola
is
going
to
be
dead
and
gone,
so
i
want
to
protect
that
interest,
which
the
settlement
takes
away.
isn't
that,
wouldn't
that
be,
whether
i
have
a
good
case
on
the
merits
is
another
question,
but
wouldn't
i
have
a
right
to
intervene?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the,
the
government
as
i
understand
it
says
yes
you
have
a
right
to
intervene
and
you
have
a
right
to
appeal
to
the
limited
extent
that
you
are
contesting
the
settlement.
that's
the
government's
position.
and
you
are
saying
that's
a
wrong
position.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
disagree
with
anything
the
government
said
in
its
brief
about
the
objector
has
a
right
to
intervene,
he
can
do
so
even
after
judgment
within
the
time
allowed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
are
disagreeing
with
the
seventh
circuit.
seventh
circuit,
as
i
understand
it,
says
you
have
a
right
to
intervene,
but
you
must
exercise
it
when
you
know
about
the
settlement,
and
it's
too
late
after
judgment.
so
you
are
disagreeing
with
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
has.
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--no.
the
seventh
circuit
has
said;
it
has
dismissed.
it
said
you
have
a
right
to
be
here,
but
you
should
have
intervened
when
you
knew
that
you
were
objecting
to
the
settlement.
it's
too
late
to
do
so
after
the
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
millett,
i
would
be
very
impressed
with
the
argument
you
are
making
now
about
having
the
thing
run
neat
and
tidy,
but
for
two
things.
are
you
aware
of
any
experience
in
the
second
or
third
circuit
that
creates
these,
this
pandemonium
that
you
are
now
describing?
and
second,
when
did
the
government
find
out
about
the
pandemonium?
because
in
felzen,
as
i
recall,
you
took
the
position
that
the
objector
can
come
in,
object
to
the
settlement,
and
can
appeal
for
the
limited
purpose
of
challenging
the
settlement
without
intervening.
what
happened
between
felzen
and
this
case,
and
are
you
basing
your
prediction
of
pandemonium
on
any
experience
in
the
second
and
third
circuit
that
allowed
objectors
to
appeal
for
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
was
felzen?
how
long
ago
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
ask
you,
because
your
time
is
so
limited,
could
you
tell
us
what
is
the
difference
between
your
view
of
this
case
and
mr.
gold's
view
of
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could
deny
it
in
court.
you
could
say
to
the
extent
that
they
wanted
to
intervene
to
contest
the
settlement,
fine,
to
the
extent
that
they
want
to
take
discovery,
it's
not
fine.
but
to
say
that
because
they
asked
for
too
much
they
are
not
entitled
to
anything,
is,
i
would
think
the
government
would
say
the
judge
was
right
to
say
they
can't
engage
in
discovery.
the
judge
was
right
to
say
they
are
not
entitled
to
an
injunction.
but
to
say
that
they
can't
intervene--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
denied
the
motion
to
intervene,
which
had
many
parts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
should
not
the
proper
ruling
have
been
yes,
you
can
intervene,
but
only
for
this
limited
purpose,
instead
of
saying
motion
denied?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
district
judge
certainly
thought
that
his
wording
on
the
objection,
he
twice
said
if
you
don't
agree,
appeal
it.
and
the
"it"
was
his
appeal
of
the
settlement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
disagree
with
the
seventh
circuit,
which
would
require
the
motion
to
intervene
to
be
made
prejudgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
