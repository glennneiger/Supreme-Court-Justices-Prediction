mr.
laurence
e.
gold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
well
settled
rule
that
we
begin
from
and
that
the
petitioners
accept
is
that
only
parties
to
a
lawsuit
or
those
that
properly
become
parties
may
appeal
an
adverse
judgment.
the
basic
point
of
the
petitioners,
the
point
from
which
everything
else
springs,
is
that
the
unnamed
class
members
are
parties
to
a
class
action
suit.
that
premise
is
wrong.
in
a
rule
23
case,
the
only
litigating
persons
before
the
court
are
the
persons
who
initiate
and
prosecute
the
case
as
parties
opposing
the
class,
the
persons
who
are
served
with
process
and
defend
the
lawsuit
as
representative
parties,
and
the
persons
who
move
to
intervene
and
are
granted
intervention.
the
very
point
of
the
class
action
is
to
provide
for
representative
party
suits
where
the
class
is
so
numerous
that
joinder
of
all
the
unnamed
class
members
is
impractical.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the...
to
the
extent
that
that
is
your
point,
and
you
move
to
intervene
to
replace
the
representative
party,
that's
a
motion
that
has
to
be
dealt
with.
the,
the
"fairness
hearing"
and
the
process
of
the
district
court--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--but
that
wasn't--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
but
you
are
not
saying
that
the
representative
is
not
adequate
to
represent
you
for
purposes
of
the
settlement.
your
objection
is
that
the
settlement
is
not
fair,
proper
and
adequate.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
in...
in
the
sense,
your
honor,
what
we
are
saying
is
not
that
the
class
representative
in
fact
has
not
properly
and
adequately
represented
the
class.
it
is
that
the
individual
can,
has
a
proper
argument
for
intervention
on
that
theory.
it
isn't
that
the,
the
individual
in
making
objections
is
necessarily
challenging
the
propriety
and
adequacy
of
representation.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i'm
not
arguing
that
there
is
not
a
"difference
of
opinion"
or
conflict.
if--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no.
i
am
not.
no.
but
i
am
arguing
that
the
making
of
objections,
whether
it
is
by
a
class
member
or
the,
a
nonclass
member
who
is
interested
and
affected
by
the
class
action
and
the
class
action
settlement,
as
was
the
case
in
marino,
by
making
an
objection
is
not
entering
the
case
and
litigating
in
the
case.
that
is,
as
a
party.
that
is
the
very
point
of
the
court's
opinion
in
marino
vs.
ortiz.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that
is
correct.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
they
are
the
members
of
the
class
but
they
are
not
parties
to
the
lawsuit.
that
is
the
whole--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--there
is
no
argument
here
that
you
made
a
deal
and
the
lawyers
are
getting
the
lion's
share.
here
the
lawyers
were
paid
on--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
don't
understand
the
government
to
argue
that
the
motion
must
be
granted,
and
i'll--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--it's
intervention
of,
of
right,
but
not
automatic.
intervention
of
right
is
not
a,
a
motion
that
has
to
be
granted
without
a
showing.
intervention
of
right
is
intervention
of,
to
file,
to
participate
in
the
litigation
by
doing
something.
and
it's
our
view
that
since
we
are
talking
about
a
status
to
take
an
appeal
in
a
representative
action,
it's
a
motion
to
press
a
case
into
court,
into
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
litigate
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
as,
for
the
class
and
unnecessarily
on
behalf
of
the
class.
the
point
of
appeal--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--you
would,
you
have
a
right
to
intervene,
but
your...
what
you
are
doing
if
you
seek
to
intervene
to
take
an
appeal
is
to
proceed
on
behalf
of
the
class
and
to
invalidate
and
have
vacated
the,
the
settlement
agreement
which
is
not
an
agreement
which
either
cuts
your
cola,
the
trust,
having
acted--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no.
i
am
not
saying
that
that
is
a
wrong
position.
i
am
saying
that
it
is
our
view
first
of
all
that
it
is
a
right
position.
and
secondly,
we
would
suggest
that
the,
the
standard
for
showing
intervention
is
not
simply
that
you
are
a
class
member,
and
that
you
have
objections
to
the
settlement,
but
also,
a
showing
that
you
have
colorable
objections
and
that
in,
in
pressing
those
objections,
you
are
going
to
do
so
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
interests
of
the
class.
now,
that's
our
view
of
the
proper
standard
for
the
proper
showing
on
behalf
of
the
intervention.
we
think
that
that
standard
is
exactly
the
correct
standard
for
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
class
action.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
it
isn't...
it
is;
it
would
be
the
standard
for
a
class
member
to
intervene
as--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--he
has
an
absolute
right
to
participate
in
the,
in
the
fairness
hearing.
but
that
is
not
a
litigating
right.
he
is,
objectors
advise
the
court
on
their
views
of
why
the
settlement
is--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
but
the
making
of
objections
is
not
coming
into
the
action
to
litigate,
but
as
if
your
objection
is
a
motion,
which
the
court
passes
on
or
not.
the
court
is
considering
a
question
posed
by
the
litigating
parties,
whether
the
settlement
agreement
is
fair
and
proper
in
order
to
be
approved.
objectors
have
the
right
to
state
their
views
for
the
court's
consideration.
the
courts
also--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no.
not
to
have
the
court
rule
on
the
objection.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no.
the
court
rules
overall,
having
considered--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no.
the
objections
can
be
of
all
shapes
and
sizes,
justice
stevens.
they
can
be
that
the
settlement
doesn't
provide
enough
for
the
x
or
y
class
and
the
judge
doesn't
say
that
that's
precisely
what
the
x
or
y
class
ought
to
get,
and
i
reject
that
as
an
objection.
the
judge's
role
is,
is
the
settlement
fair,
proper
and
adequate?
and
the
point
is,
our
basic
point
is
if
a
class
member
wishes
to
go
further
and
take
the
case
to
another
stage
where
he
is
litigating
on
behalf
of
the
class,
he
ought
to
be
an
intervenor
and
a
party,
not
simply
someone
who
is
not
a
party.
we
think
that
that's
proper,
whatever
the
right
standard
on
intervention
is,
and
we
believe
that
the
standard
i
have
articulated
makes
sense
in
the
class
action.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
we
think
definitely
that
an
objector
or
even
a
class
member
who
hasn't
participated
in
the
objection
process
can
intervene
to
take
an
appeal
and
to
forward
the
objections
made
in
the
objection
process
by
anyone,
but
we
think
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
the
government...
neither,
i
don't
believe
the
seventh
circuit
has
passed
on
the,
the
propriety
of
intervention
after
judgment.
our
only
point
is--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--that
only
parties
can...
no,
they
said
that
you
can
intervene
after.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
the
government
doesn't
take
that
position.
we
don't
take
that
position.
