justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
that
is,
if
this
is
open
under
the
language,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
real
difference
between
the
parties
as
a
practical
matter,
except
you
want
to
say
the
person
all
the
time,
no
matter
what,
can
bring
an
appeal,
and
they
want
to
say
what
you
should
do
is
intervene
and
that
gives
the
district
judge
a
chance
to
act
in
an
unusual
situation
as
a
kind
of
safeguard
to
make
sure
that
it
is
fair.
i
mean,
this
person
could
be
anybody
under
the
sun.
it
could
muck
up
the
litigation
for
everybody
else.
the
extra
time
involved
might
be
important,
and
it
might
be
totally
unfair,
given
the
prior
history,
to
allow
this
individual
to
bring
the
appeal.
so
all
they
are
saying
is
that
the
judge
should
have
a
chance
as
a
gatekeeper
to
make
that
determination.
now
why
not,
if
it's
open
under
the
language,
say
there
is
a
little
more
conservative
position,
gives
us
a
chance
to
not
get
things
mixed
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
gained
something.
i
mean,
normally
the
judge
would
grant
it,
but
let's
say
he
didn't.
it
would
be
some
pretty
good
reason.
maybe
it
would
be
very
unfair,
etcetera
and
you
say
well,
he
will
just
appeal
that.
that's
true.
but
it's
quite
a
different
matter
as
an
appellate
court
to
decide
whether
the
judge
abused
his
discretion
there
than
to
have
to
go
through
what
could
be
15
years'
worth
of
litigation
to
figure
out
whether
this
settlement
nor
the
circumstances
is
a
fair
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
advisory
committee
could
solve
this
either
way,
couldn't
they,
the
rules
committee?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
hasn't
it?
why
hasn't
it
decided
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it,
has
there
been
a
problem
the
other
way?
the
seventh
circuits
that
have
gone
the
other
way?
