justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
gold,
if
he
is
challenging
the
representative's
fee,
i
think
he
is,
which
often
is
what
the
minority
member
of
the
class
objects
to,
the
large
fee
that
the
class
representatives,
the
lawyers
get.
you
can't
say
there
is
not
a
conflict
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
are
certainly
not
arguing
that
the
lawyer
adequately
represents
the
person
who
is
objecting
to
his
fee
either,
are
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
gold,
that's
not
the
standard
that
applies
to
the
right
of
a
class
member
to
participate
in
the
district
court
proceeding,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
intervene.
i'm
just
asking
to
participate
in
the
district
court
objecting
to
the
settlement.
don't
he
have
an
absolute
right
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
has
that
right,
whether
or
not
the
district
court
may
view
his
objections
as
colorable
or
frivolous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
to
have
the
court
rule
on
the
objection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
you
don't
think
that,
they
can
file
an
objection,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
rule
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
approving
the
settlement
in
the
face
of
an
objection
is
the
ruling
that
the
objection
is
without
merit.
it
seems
to
me.
i
don't
know.
maybe
you
know
something--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
under
your
view
of
the
requirement
of
an
intervention
for
purposes
of
appeal,
could
the
district
judge
in
this
case,
in
response
to
the
intervention
motion
that
was
actually
filed,
have
granted
that
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
