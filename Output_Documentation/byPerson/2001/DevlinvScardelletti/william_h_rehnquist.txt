chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
the
judgment
operates
directly
upon
the
class
member,
as
if
we
are
talking
about
some
sort
of
physical
thing,
but
how
is
that
operation
on
the
class
member
different
from,
say,
what
might
be
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
in
some
other
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
rule
23
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
do
we
find
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereabouts
in
the
constitution
of
institutional
investors?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
agree
that
you
must
intervene
in
the
district
court,
or
do
you
say
you
don't
even
do
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading,
where
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
are
you
starting
on
(a)(3)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
court
grants
your
motion
to
intervene?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
discretion
would
the
district
court
have
if
your
theory
is
right,
mr.
goldstein,
that
an
objector
doesn't
even
have
to
intervene?
i
mean,
in
a
very
complicated
case
the
objector
simply
says
i
object,
i'm
not
a
party.
what
can
the
district
court
judge
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
what
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
are
saying
that
i
am
reaching
out
and
bringing
you
into
the
case
in
spite
of
the
fact
you
haven't
moved
to
intervene?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
he
give
jurisdiction
over
people
that
are
simply
on
the
outside;
they
are
not
parties;
all
they
are
doing
is
objecting?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
theory,
any
objector
can
appeal,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
no
matter
how
complicated
the
case
in
the
district
court,
they
don't
have
to
intervene.
you
are
going
to
have
15
or
20
appeals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
ms.
millett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
under
petitioner's
view
that
person
would
be
able
to
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
felzen
was
three
years
ago.
i
was--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
that
was
properly
raised.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we'll
decide
that
another
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
take
it
the
question
you
presented
and
your
petition
for
certiorari,
that's
what
we
granted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.

scardelletti
