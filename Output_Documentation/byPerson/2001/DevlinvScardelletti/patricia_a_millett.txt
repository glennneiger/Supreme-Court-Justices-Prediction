ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
agree
with
petitioners
that
objectors
who
have
expressed
objections
to
settlement
agreements
have
important
interests
and
often
should
be
allowed
to
appeal.
our
disagreement
is
on
the
mechanism
by
which
someone
gets
to
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
there
is
a
practical
significance
to
this
process.
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
class
actions
can
come
in
many
forms
and
shapes
and
can
involve
up
to,
as
this
court
knows
from
the
asbestos
cases,
tens
of
thousands
of
people,
any
one
of
whom
can
express
an
objection.
and
it
is
actually
incorrect
and
we
disagree
with
the
argument
that
you
will
know
at
the
objection
stage
whether
in
fact
that
person
even
really
is
a
member
of
the
class
action,
who
has
a
live
claim
that
is
covered
by
the
class.
so
what
the
intervention
motion
process
allows
is,
we
don't
think
a
merits
determination
on
the
value
of
the
objection,
but
we
think
it
allows
a
district
court
in
the
first
instance
to
make
a
record
and
address
whether
someone
is
a
member
of
the
class.
i
mean,
you
could
have
a
class
action
that's
not
as
discrete
as
this
one
here,
but
the
definition
of
the
class
is
everyone
employed
by
x
corporation
for
a
period
of
10
years.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
whether
or
not
there
is
stale
claim.
but
it,
you
could
have
objections
that
really
simply
don't
have
any
relevance
to
the
issue
that
will
be
presented
on
appeal.
for
example,
in
this
case,
i
think
as
mr.
gold
said,
objections
come
in
many
shapes
and
sizes.
and
if
i
could
refer
the
court
to
joint
appendix
page
125,
we
have
an
objection
that
says
please
consider
this
letter
my
objection.
that's
it.
it
gives
no
elucidation
to
anyone
on
the
basis
for
appeal.
now,
how
the
court
can
deal
with
this,
this
deprives
the
district
court
of
any
opportunity
to
address
this
concern
as
a
part
of
the
settlement.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that's
my
understanding
of
petitioner's
view,
without
having
given
the
district
court
any
opportunity,
or
the
attorneys
who
are
representing
that
person
at
that
point,
to
address
this
concern
is
part
of
the
fairness
hearing.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
they
don't
have
to
be
there
physically,
in
person,
but
there
is
motions
practice
in
district
courts,
and
a
district
court
would
decide
whether
or
not
they
want
someone
there
in
person
or
not.
but
intervention
rights--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--there
is
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
intervention
of
right
doesn't
mean
the
district
court
doesn't
have
some
final
say.
but
when
we
need
to
understand,
objections
are
coming
before
a
settlement
has
been
approved,
and
it
may
well
be
even
if
this
objection
is
very
vague,
i
have
got
enough
other
objections
that
in
fact
would
capture
what
that
person
is
concerned
about
without
them
having
told
me.
and
if
they
object...
the
objection
process,
the
fairness
hearing
is
very
flexible
and
informal
at
this
point
and
allows
the
district
court
to
gather
information
and
make
a
decision
whether
to
approve
the
settlement
agreement.
it
would
be
very
unworkable,
and
i
think
unwise
to
adopt
a
rule
that
turns
the
fairness
hearing,
which
is
supposed
to
focus
on
the
settlement
agreement
and
dealing
with
serious
objections,
i
think
that's
what
courts
want
to
do,
into
a
fairness
hearing/qualifications
for
appeal,
where
i
have
got
to
spend
all
my
time
not
just
deciding
whether
i
should
approve
this
settlement
agreement
or
not,
so
that
you
would
even
be
aggrieved,
but
in
advance
i
have
to
decide
whether
you
are
part
of
the
class
and
someone
who
could--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--concrete
evidence
of
pandemonium,
no,
there
is
no
concrete
evidence
that
intervention
is
a
difficult
barrier
in
the
five
circuits
that
have
required...
in
fact,
the
seven
circuits
that
require
this
intervention
motion.
so
our
position
is
based
on
analysis
of
the
rules.
we
have
an
established
mechanism
in
the
rules
for
dealing
with
deciding
who
will
be
a
litigating
party,
not
one
of
the
10,000
on
the
sideline,
but
a
litigating
party
in
a
case.
now
at
the
time
of
felzen,
we
didn't
have
as
much
experience
with
the
limited
intervention
option
for
purposes
of
appeal.
and
it
seems
that
now
when
we
focus
on
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
was...
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
know.
about
seven
years.
but
in
the
intervening
time,
there
have
been
some
decisions
from
the
seventh
circuit
that
have
propounded
this
notion,
in
particular,
seventh
circuit,
that
have
propounded,
and
the
eighth
circuit,
too,
that
have
propounded
this
notion
of
limited
intervention
for
purposes
of
appeal.
and
i
have
to
say
we
have
also
just
reviewed
and
reconsidered
our
position,
and
looking
at
the
text
of
the
rules,
we
have
an
answer
to
this
problem.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i'm
sorry.
but
the
point
is
that
we
have
an
answer,
our
position
is
that
there
is
an
answer
in
the
rules
to
this
problem
and
it's
limited
intervention
for
purposes
of
appeal.
and
the
alternative
is
to
make
up
an
ad
hoc
rule
cut
out
of
out
of
whole
cloth.
that
seems
to
collect
a
variety
of
factors
that
happen
to
have
been
present
in
this
case--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think,
well,
putting
aside,
we
think
there
is
more,
we
don't
think
that
the
objectors
are
parties
but
we
are
somewhat
more
sympathetic
to
the
notion
that
they
have
the
same
interests
as
quasi
parties,
i
think,
than
mr.
gold
is.
secondly,
and
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
his
mouth,
but
my
understanding
of
their
brief
and
argument
here
is
that
they
would
have
some
more
rigid
scrutiny
of
the
intervention
as
a
right
motion,
and
in
fact
would
require
the
person
to
demonstrate
that
they
can
represent
the
interests
of
the
class.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the
intervention
for
purposes
of
appeal?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
could
it
have,
i
guess
the
district
court
would
have
had
the
power
contingently
to
reserve
judgment.
because,
remember
that
motion
was
made
before
the
settlement
was
even
distributed
and
notice
was
given,
so
it
would
have
been
odd
to
grant
intervention
for
a
settlement
judgment
that
had
not
yet
been
entered
and
the
judge
hadn't
heard
objections
or
had
a
fairness
hearing.
i
mean
district
court
can
only
say
i'll
reserve
judgment
and
i
will
renew
or
revisit
this
question
for
limited
purposes
of
appeal
after
i
have
judgment,
if
you
are
still
interested,
if
your
concerns
are
not
addressed.
in
this
case,
the
intervention
was,
again,
before
the
settlement
was
even
distributed
to
members
of
the
class,
and
it
was
joined
with
a
motion
that
asked
to
strike
class
counsel
for
preliminary
injunction.
and
so
i
think,
and
it
hasn't
been
contested
that
the
district
court
was
well
within
its
discretion
to
deny.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the
district
court
never
said
that
they
can't
intervene
for
purposes
of
appeal
because
they
were
never--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
it
just
said
to
intervene.
the
motion
itself
just
says
to
intervene
and
then
was
accompanied
with
this,
other
motions
asking--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
i
think
if
this
court
would
adopt
the
rule
and
recognize
that
limited
intervention
for
purposes
of
appeal
is
appropriate
in
this
context,
district
courts
will
know
that
that's
an
option
and
be
able
to
address
it
or
raise
it
with
attorneys.
but
the
important
thing
here
is
i
think--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--he
said
that.
he
also
twice
told
him
that
he
wasn't
a
party
to
the
case,
as
well.
i
think...
the
point
is,
you
may
have
thought
he
would
ask,
but
our
interest
in
this
case
is
less
the
particular,
we
gave
the
court
our
best
judgment
of
how
the
record--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--if
that's
how
one
reads...
i
assume
you
are
talking
about
the
navigant
opinion?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
there
is
a
prior
opinion
and
i'm
sorry,
the
name,
escapes
me
from,
which
judge
easterbrook
also
wrote,
which
we
think
adopted
our
position.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
thank
you.
