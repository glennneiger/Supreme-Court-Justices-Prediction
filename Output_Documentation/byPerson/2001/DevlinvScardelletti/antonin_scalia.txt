justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
test
your
thesis
that
u
are
bound
by
a
judgment,
you
are
a
party
to
it?
i
mean,
there
are
cases
where
someone
who
has
allied
with
a
party
and
has
used
the
same
attorney
and
has
maybe
had
some
input
into
trial
strategy,
that
that
person
will
be
bound
by
the
judgment,
but
as
far
as
i
know,
we
have
never
allowed,
no
court
that
i
know
of
has
ever
allowed
such
a
person
to
take
an
appeal
on
the
ground
that
well,
since
you
would
have
been
bound,
you
are
a
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
still
before
us,
i
mean,
the
denial
of
the
intervention
motion?
