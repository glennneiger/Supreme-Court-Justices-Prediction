justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
will
your
rule
hold
for
certiorari
petitions
as
well,
so
if,
let's
say,
a
named
class
member
takes
an
appeal,
but
then
the
class
petitions
for
certiorari,
that
any
non-named
class
member
can
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
your
rule
is
that
you
are
a
party.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
your
philosophy
you
are
a
party
to
the
court
of
appeals
because
you
are
bound
by
the
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
a
purely
formal
disagreement,
or
are
there
some
distinct
practical
advantages
that
you
can
tell
us
to
your
rule
so
that
the
district
judge,
i
assume,
can
give
some
shape
and
direction
to
the
appeal?
is
that
the
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
beyond
the
determination
that
they
are
members
of
the
class,
are
there
any
further
purposes
served
by
the
intervention
rule
you
propose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not,
i
don't
think
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
question
that
you
have
presented.
the
question
is
whether
you
have
standing
to
appeal.
