justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
question
before
us
is
whether
the
petitioner,
a
member
of
the
plaintiff’s
class,
certified
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
23(b)(1)
who
objected
to
the
approval
of
a
settlement
at
the
fairness
hearing
may
subsequently
bring
an
appeal
despite
the
fact
that
he
is
neither
a
named
class
representative,
nor
a
successful
intervener
in
the
action.
reversing
the
fourth
circuit,
we
hold
that
he
can.
this
court
has
held
that
only
parties
may
properly
bring
an
appeal.
we
have
never
restricted
this
rule
however,
to
named
parties.
petitioner’s
interest
is
similar
to
those
of
non-parties
we
have
allowed
to
appeal
in
the
past.
he
objected
in
the
district
court
and
most
importantly,
he
is
bound
by
the
district
court’s
approval
of
the
settlement.
this
should
be
sufficient
to
trigger
his
right
to
appeal.
that
right
cannot
be
effectively
accomplished
through
the
named
class
representative.
once
the
class
representative
reaches
a
settlement
with
which
another
class
member
does
not
agree,
their
interest
necessarily
diverge.
allowing
an
appeal
is
necessary
to
protect
petitioner’s
interests
in
the
settlement
by
which
he
has
bound
despite
his
expressed
objections
before
the
district
court.
we
also
reject
the
government’s
suggestion
that
non-named
class
members
should
be
required
to
first
intervene
for
purposes
of
appeal.
the
government
admits
such
intervention
should
be
freely
granted.
we
therefore,
see
little
advantage
to
requiring
the
class
members
to
go
through
the
additional
steps
of
seeking
district
court
approval
of
their
right
to
appeal.
as
no
statute
or
rule
of
civil
procedure
requires
such
intervention,
we
decline
to
require
it
here.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
descending
opinion
which
justices
kennedy
and
thomas
have
joined.
