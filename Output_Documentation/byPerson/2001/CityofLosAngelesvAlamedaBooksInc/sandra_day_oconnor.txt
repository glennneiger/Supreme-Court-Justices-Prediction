doesn't
answer
the
question,
exactly.
justice

o'connor
but
now
we're
talking
about
an
ordinance
that
doesn't
focus
on
the
concentration
of
adult
businesses
but,
rather,
the
combination,
because
the
city
doesn't
want
the
business
to
break
into
two
parts,
even
though
it
tried
to
operate
as
one
business,
and
i
guess
the
the
nineteen
seventy-seven
study
didn't
address
the
combination,
the
effects
of
a
combination
of
focuses
in
a
single
business,
whereas
your
ordinance
does.

concentration

operated
as

well,
what
if
the...

you
can
sell

not
beta

in

thing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
your
question
presented
seems
to
be
quite
narrow.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
city
did
not
study
the
combination
but,
rather,
relied
on
judicially
approved
statutory
precedent
from
other
jurisdictions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
wasn't
suitable
reliance,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thought
that
wouldn't
do
it
because
hart
addressed
the
health
effects...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
effects
on
crime.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
i
don't
know,
it
just
struck
me
in
reading
the
question
that
it
was
pretty
much
limited
to
whether
they
were
right
about
whether
you
could
rely
on
the
hart
decision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
before
the
adoption
of
this
amendment?
justice
sandra

o'connor
thought
that
hart
relied
on
the
negative
health
effects
of
the
arcade.
