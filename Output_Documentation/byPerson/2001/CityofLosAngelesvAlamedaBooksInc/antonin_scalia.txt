your
clients
didn't
didn't
have
businesses
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
initially
passed,
which
of
the
two
types
of
business
did
they
offer?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
did
they
start
as,
a
bookstore,
or
as
an...
justice
antonin
scalia
each
of
these
each
of
these
businesses
was
one
or
the
other
of
those
things
and
operated
on
that
basis
alone
for
how
long?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
operated
at
a
profit
or
at
a
loss?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
did
it
for
a
couple
of
years,
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
in
the
ordinance
in
fact
exist
in
the
real
world
out
there,
justice
antonin
scalia
video
arcades
only?
justice
antonin
scalia
bookstores
only...
justice
antonin
scalia
without
arcades
in
them...
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
forth,
every
one
of
the
categories,
adult
adult
movies
only?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
pre-
prevent
these
stores
from
allowing
customers
to
preview
the
films
before
they
decide
whether
to
buy
them,
the
stores
that
sell
adult
films.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
the
ordinance,
can
a
customer
come
in
and
say,
before
i
buy
this
film,
i
would
like
to
see
it,
and
the
store
manager
says
sure,
go
ahead,
look
at
it
first,
then
you
can
decide
whether
to
buy
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
free.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
ordinance
permits
that...
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
want
to
charge
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
you
measured
you
measured
the
effect
of
a
video
store
what
what
do
you
call
these,
an
arcade
store,
and
a
bookstore
side-by-side,
and
you
found
that
that
was
deleterious,
and
the
problem
is
that
you
did
not
measure
what
the
different
effect
would
be
if
you
knocked
down
the
wall
between
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know
of
any
other
cities
that
had
the
experience
of
businesses
such
as
the
two
involved
here,
which
were
originally
involved
in
one
s-
sex
pandering
activity,
and
then,
after
the
ordinance
was
passed,
went
into
a
second
one
instead
of
opening
up
a
sep-
a
separate
store?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
may
be
unique,
but
the
situation
that
they
confronted
may
be
unique
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
that's
not
how
i
read
those
pages.
justice
antonin
scalia
highland
book
was
issued
a
picture
arcade
police
permit.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
this
is
this
is
the
affidavit
of
the
owner
of
both
of
these...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
thing
that's
relevant
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
really
another...
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wiener
meant
when
he
said
in
his
affidavit,
prior
to
june
of
nineteen
ninety-one
the
only
adult
type
of
busi-,
the
only
adult
type
of
business
use
at
highland
books
was
its
picture
arcade
which
at
all
times
exhibited
exclusively...
justice
antonin
scalia
he
had
in
mind
that
no
more
than
fourty-nine
percent
of
other
business...
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
why
that's
why
the
only
adult
business
he
was
doing
there
was
the
other
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
not
saying
we
were
selling
adult
books,
but
selling
less
than
fifty
percent
of
adult
books.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
appreciate
your
testimony
to
that
effect,
but
what
his
affidavit
clearly
says
is
that
the
only
adult
business
he
did
prior
to
nineteen
ninety-one
was
the
e-
exhibition
of
adult
videotapes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
this
fifty-one
fourty-nine
pertains
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
and
it
means
that
if
fourty-nine
if
if
if
less
than
fifty-one
percent
is
adult
material,
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
if
you
have
fifty-one
percent
in
one
adult
business
and
fourty-nine
percent
in
another
adult
business,
the
fourty-nine
percent
is
not
an
adult
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
i-
i-
incidentally
on
the
other
point,
i
i
i
reviewed
your
footnote.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
that
if
if
you're
objecting
to
the
to
the
municipality's
use
of
of
this
other
study,
which
didn't
treat
combined
stores,
you
r-
it
seems
to
me
you
you
you
have
to
tell
us
why
it
it
would
be
likely
that
combining
the
diverse
businesses
under
one
roof
could
make
any
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
well
maybe
maybe
they
could
do
that.
