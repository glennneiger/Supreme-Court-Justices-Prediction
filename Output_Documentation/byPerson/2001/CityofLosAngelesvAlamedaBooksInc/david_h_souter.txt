justice
david
h.
souter
did
your
evidence
in
seventy-eight
or
any
evidence
since
then
specifically
address
the
question
of
whether
the
combination
of
more
than
one
form
of
business
at
one
location
has
any
measurable
effect
on,
you
know,
the
deleterious
effect
that
you
you
measured?
justice
david
h.
souter
to
impossible
to
do,
why
should
be
you
be
allowed,
under
the
first
amendment,
to
do
it?
i
mean,
it
it
sounds
as
though
you're
you're
you're
kind
of
making
an
argument
from
spectral
evidence
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
and
you've
documented
it,
but
as
i
understand
it,
you've
documented
it
with
reference
to
adult
businesses
which
were
not
at
the
time
defined
or
identified
as
necessarily
being
businesses
that
offered
only
one
service,
as
opposed
to
a
business
like
these,
that
offers
two,
so
that
the
evidence,
as
i
understand
it,
did
not
address
the
the
issue
that
that
is
before
us
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
th-
we're,
i
think
we're
playing
with
words.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
you
know
that,
any
more
than
i
know
it?
i
mean,
i
i
ca-
i
see
your
i
see
your
point
when
you
say,
look,
if
if
there
are
two
different
entrepreneurs
on
a
block,
each
of
them
doing
whatever
they
can
to
draw
in
clientele,
the
odds
are
they're
probably
going
to
draw
in
a
greater
concentration
of
people
than
than
than
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
your
nineteen
seventy-eight
evidence
is
going
to
bear
on
these
various
possibilities
depends
on
more
specific
facts.
justice
david
h.
souter
equally
logical
deduction
that
by
looking
at
the
cover
of
the
shrink-wrapped
magazine
and
and
watching
part
of
a
video
cli-,
or
a
video
clip
of
something
that
you
ultimately
buy,
i-
you're
going
to
be
left
in
about
the
same
frame
of
mind
in
either
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
covers
are
dull,
but
i
assumed
they
were
pretty
racy,
and
if
you
look
at
sixty
covers
and
sixty
clip
i
don't
know,
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
because
she
she
asked
how
the
hart
facts
could
help
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
hart,
the
as
i
under-
am
i
am
i,
maybe
i'm
wrong,
but
i
i
thought
the
the
basis
for
the
governmental
action
in
hart
was
was
public
health
based
on
the
activity
that
was
going
on
in
these
booths.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
pose
that
question
to
pose
it
the
way
justice
kennedy
did?
the
the
the
the
the
question
is,
does
the
particular
combination
increase
the
degree
of
clientele,
because
we
know
that
the
greater
the
clientele,
the
greater
the
crime
rate
is
going
to
be,
and
so
there
there
seems
to
me
to
be
a
factual
basis
for
saying
that
the
clientele
is
a
kind
of
a
surrogate
measure
for
those
very
effects
that
the
city
can
legitimately
try
to
counteract.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
amount
of
clientele
is
associated
with
the
problems.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
seem
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
we
should
decide
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
city's
evidence,
as
it
now
exists,
would
not
be
a
sustainable
basis
for
an
ordinance
saying,
you
can't
have
two
you
can't
have
twenty-five
different
adult
uses
in
one
arcade.
