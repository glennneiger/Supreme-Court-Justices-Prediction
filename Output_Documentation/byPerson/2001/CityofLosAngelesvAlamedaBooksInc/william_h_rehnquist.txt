getting

just
how
precise
a

that's

very
well,

in

ri-
we're

why

this

a

in
a

of

chief

william

not
simply
a
question
of
people,
but
surely
the
kind
of
of
of
secondary
effects
that
have
been
spoken
of
of
in
cases
depend
upon
people's
activities,
and
the
people
aren't
ten

they're
somehow
associated
with

business.
chief

william

don't
you
think
the

is
entitled
to
draw
what

inferences
from
the
studies
that
it
made,
and
that
it
doesn't
have
to

evidence
for
every

thing
that
it
does
in

ordinance?
chief

william

rehnquist
that
question
is
fairly
subsumed
by
the,
in
the
question
presented.
chief

there
wasn't
a

specifically
to
it.

los
angeles
versus
alameda
books,
inc.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
city
of
los
angeles
conducted
a
study
which
found
that
concentrations
of
adult
establishment
are
associated
with
higher
crime
rates
than
surrounding
communities.
in
response,
the
city
enacted
an
ordinance
that
prohibited
the
location
of
adult
establishments
or
structures
within
a
thousand
feet
of
each
other.
because
the
ordinance
had
a
loophole
that
permitted
multiple
adult
operations
within
the
same
structure,
the
city
amended
the
ordinance
to
prohibit
the
placement
of
more
than
one
adult
operation
in
the
same
building.
respondents
who
owned
adult
establishments
that
operate
and
adult
bookstore
and
adult
video
arcade
on
the
same
premises
filed
a
1983
suit
alleging
that
the
ordnance
violates
the
first
amendment.
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
evaluating
the
cities
ordinance
under
our
precedent
in
renton
v.
playtime
theatres.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
city
failed
to
present
evidence
upon
which
it
could
reasonably
rely
to
demonstrate
that
its
regulation
of
multiple
youth
establishments
was
designed
to
serve
a
substantial
interest
in
reducing
crime.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
o’connor,
we
now
reverse.
the
city’s
1977
study
found
that
concentrations
of
adult
establishments
are
correlated
with
crime.
the
study
did
not
explain
why
that
was
but
adult
establishments
house
adult
operations
so
concentrations
of
adult
establishments
are
also
concentrations
of
adult
operations
albeit
in
separate
structures.
therefore,
this
1977
study’s
finding
is
consistent
with
the
city’s
view
that
it
is
concentration
of
adult
operations
and
not
merely
concentrations
of
separate
buildings
that
house
individual
adult
operations
that
generate
crime.
this
view
explains
the
city’s
restriction
on
concentrations
of
not
just
adult
establishments
but
of
also
in
any
adult
operation.
therefore,
at
this
stage
of
the
party’s
litigation
which
is
before
us
on
summary
judgment,
we
conclude
that
the
city
may
reasonably
rely
on
its
1977
study
to
demonstrate
a
connection
between
the
speech
it
seems
to
regulate
and
its
substantial
interest
in
reducing
crime.
