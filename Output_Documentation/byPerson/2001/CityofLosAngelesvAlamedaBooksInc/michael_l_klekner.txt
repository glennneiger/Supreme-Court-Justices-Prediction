mr.
michael
l.
klekner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
may
it
please
the
court.
following
its
nineteen
seventy-seven
pioneering
study,
the
city
of
los
angeles
enacted
a,
in
nineteen
seventy-eight
a
comprehensive
zoning
ordinance
regulating
the
location
of
all
types
of
adult
business
activities
in
the
city.
the
ordinance
defined
eight
business
activities
and
required
that
they
each
be
separated
from
each
other
by
one
thousand
feet.
notwithstanding
the
clear
intent
of
the
city's
ordinance
in
nineteen
seventy-eight,
it
became
apparent
that
the
ordinance
could
and
was
being
interpreted
to
permit
more
than
one
adult
business
in
the
same
building.
this
has
been
described
by
plaintiffs
as
a
drafting
error
or
an
inad-
inadvertent
loophole,
but
it
was
an
ambiguity,
and
it
became
necessary
to
amend
the
original
ordinance
in
nineteen
eighty-three
to
remove
that
ambiguity,
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
thereby...
d-
do
you
know...
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
seventy-eight,
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
i
believe
they
did.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
study
specifically
analyzed
specific
combinations
in
one
building.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
the
purpose
of
the
study.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
the
businesses
regulated
here
did
not
offer
both.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
i'm
sorry,
are
you,
b-
b-,
i
did
not
hear
the...
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
well,
these
businesses
started
in
the
late
eighties,
early
nineteen
nineties,
either
as
a
bookstore
or
as
an
adult
arcade.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
well
after
the
adoption
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
is
that
each
w-
i
think
it
was
highland
books
started
as
an
adult
arcade,
and
the
reverse
was
true
for
alameda
books.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
no.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
the
the
answer
is
yes
and
no.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
well,
the
issue
of
separateness,
and
whether
a
business,
an
arcade
and
a
bookstore
can,
could,
or
should
survive
separately
is
off
the
table.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
several
years.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
that
we
never
did
any
discovery
on
that,
so
the
answer
is,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
correct.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
my
understanding
that
they
might
have
have
sell
e-
s-
excuse
me,
sold
some
books,
or
or
or
what-have-you,
but
their
primary
business
was
having
a
a
series
of
video
booths
where
you
could
watch
adult
movies.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
not
based
upon
the
facts
as
i
understand
them,
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
not
based
upon
the
facts
as
i
understand
them,
that
and
i
believe
th-
in
in
nineteen
ninety-one
it
was
alameda
books
that
f-
became
both,
and
it
was
i
think
nineteen
ninety-two
that
highland
books
became
both.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
the
theory
is
the
solution,
not
the
facts.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
the
theory
is
simply
the
solution
adopted
by
the
city
of
los
angeles
was
to
disperse.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
correct.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
there
are
several
responses
to
the
question.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
from
the
city's
perspective,
it
is
illogical,
or
not
reasonable
to
say,
for
the
city
council
to
say,
you
know
we
have
a
problem
here,
on
laseneca
boulevard,
because
we
have
too
many
adult
businesses
close
together,
so
we're
going
to
require
them
to
disperse.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
because
we
are
concerned
with
the
overall
effect
we
have
broken
down
the
ordinance
to
its
logical
components.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
they...
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
yes.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
correc-
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
correct.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
correct.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
the
problem
with
your
real-world
description
of
a
barnes
and
noble
is,
it
doesn't
exist
in
the
adult
entertainment
world.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
if
i
understand
the
correct
the
question
correctly,
no.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
for
free?
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
yes.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
we
are
talking
about...
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
a-
and
the
machines
that
allow
you
to
view
up
to
sixty
clips,
if
you
will,
from
various
adult
movies,
or
you
go
to
another
machine
in
another
booth,
you
can
i
want
to
see
that
entire
movie
right
there,
as
opposed
to
the
clips.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
the
principal
problem
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is,
of
of
course,
how
it
requires
what
it
requires,
the
use
of
of
secondary
effects
and
how
it
how
it
is
discounts,
if
you
will,
or
disregards
this
court's
precedent,
is
effectively
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
said.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
the
problem
we
were
addressing
was,
is
there
a
correlation,
to
use
the
term
you
use-,
the
word
you
used
in
barnes...
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
between
the
adult
businesses
and
secondary
effects,
do
they
cause
a
problem.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
but
it
did
address
that
issue,
because
it
is
not
reasonable
to
assume
that
if
you
have
two
businesses
side
by
side
in
the
same
block,
causing
secondary
effects,
that
it
can
require
them
to
disperse,
which
is...
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
but
there's
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other...
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
i
don't
believe
it
is
i-
it
should
be
a
problem.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
that's
the
whole
point
that
the
city's
been
trying
to
make
all
along.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
but
you
are
describing
this
in
terms
of
business
organization.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
which
is
not
how
the
city's
zoning
ordinance
works.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
if
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
businesses,
you
come
to
an
arcade
to
s-
stay
there
and
look,
and
when
you
leave
that
arcade,
you
have
a
different
frame
of
mind
than
if
you
went
to
the
bookstore,
got
your
shrink-wrapped
magazine,
put
it
in
a
brown
paper
bag,
and
went
home,
so
that's
a,
one
f-
logical
deduction
you
can
make
from
from
all
of
the
evidence
that's...
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
no.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
correct,
north
carolina.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
what
the
ninth
circuit
effectively
said
was,
there
was
some
doubt
whether
hart
would
survive
scrutiny
under
this
court's
renton
decision,
but
we
are
certainly
confident
that
under
ninth
circuit
precedent
it's
it's
not
a
valid
law.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
hopefully
not.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
that's
correct,
that
in
nineteen
seventy-nine,
our
study
supported
a
north
carolina
statute
prohibiting
more
than
one
adult
business
in
the
location,
that
that
was
a
sufficient
evidentiary
basis.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
we
are
less
we,
the
city,
is
less
concerned
with
the
factual
differences
than
with
the
legal
reasoning
and
the
fact
that
it
fully
supports,
and
should've
been
considered
for
that
purpose
by
the
ninth
circuit,
as
validating
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
original
ordinance
and
and
eighty-three's...
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
that's
what
th-,
hopefully
the
ci-,
well,
that's
what
the
city
has
been
trying
to
do,
but
again,
it
goes
back
to,
you
know,
i-
if
you
look
at
at
a-
at
your
precedents,
when
when
a
city
has
these
problems,
the
logical
the
logical
thing
for
the
city
to
do
is
say,
ban
them.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
when
you
well,
maybe
i
i
i
misspoke,
but
when
you
want
to
get
into
the
empirical
evidence
of,
are
you
a
bad
actor,
this
particular
business
is
a
bad
actor,
it's
a
very
detailed
nuisance
type
of
of
analysis,
and
when
you
have
these
combinations
of
adult
businesses,
or
side-by-side
adult
businesses,
and
you
try
to
do
that
same
analysis,
the
immediate
thing
that
is
going
to
occur,
the
first
thing
that
is
going
to
occur,
it's
not
me,
it's
my
neighbor,
it's
not
me,
it's
this
other
part
of
the
business.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
i
won't
use
an
adverb
to
describe
the
amount.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
well,
again,
t-
the
hart
reading
of
facts
in
in
that
i-
i-
in
that
decision,
aga-
go
to
the
fact
that
that
these
combinations
cause
problems,
and
that
the
city's
ordinance
or
excuse
me,
the
city's
study
supported
the
inference
that
it's
okay
to
the
solution
is
to
separate
these...
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
in
part,
yes.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
thank
you.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
well,
that's
th-
they're
you
cannot
expect
an
ordinance
to
solve
everything...
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
well,
but
that's
an
argument
to
getting
rid
of
r-
rid
the
arcades.
mr.
michael
l.
klekner
spread
out
the
patronage,
to
to
to
make
sure
that
you
don't
have
this
clustering,
the,
this
magnet
effect.
