am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
e-
the
study
which
you
rely
on,
the
nineteen
seventy-seven
study,
did
have
as
one
category
bookstore
arcade.

well
then,
is
there
nothing
to
what
we're
told,
that
the
this
combination
of
video
sales
plus
viewing
is
common
and,
indeed,
an
arcade
can't
survive
as
a
stand-alone
business,
that
the
combination
of,
you
can
see
it,
and
if
you
want
it
you
can
buy
it,
was
common?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
were
only
an
arcade
and
there
was
no
selling
going
on
when
they
were
initially...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
started
out,
though,
there
weren't
all
that
many
tapes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
you
you
say
that
the
combination
of
this
list,
you
think
of
a
bookstore,
nowadays
one
can
browse,
one
can
even
go
to
a
cafe
and
have
coffee,
and
all
that,
or
go
to
a
record
shop
and
listen
to
the
tape
and
then
buy
it.
justice

west-
i
understand
that

division,
that
that
was

not
by

problems
was,
you
had
lots
of
books,
dull
books
that
nobody
was
going
to
buy,
and
that
you
had
that
was
what
you
had
for
fifty-one
percent,
and
then
you
had
the
stuff
that
people
bought,
and
that
was
the
fourty-nine
percent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
it
would
not
have
been
considered
an
adult
bookstore
so
long
as
they
maintained
that
fifty-one...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
respect,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
that
you
are
now
making
for
tapes
plus
arcade,
sales
of
tapes
plus
arcade,
if
the
combined
uses
were
a
massage
parlor
and
an
adult
hotel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
same
thing
about
the
adult
motel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
gave
an
answer
th-
that
i
didn't
think
was
just
a
glib
lawyer's
answer.
justice

massages
don't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
buying
it,
they
get
out
of
the
store.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
questioning
whether
there's
going
to
be
more
of
a
problem
if
you
have
the
stand-alone
arcade,
where
to
see
the
film
to
the
bitter
end
you
have
to
stay
there,
but
you
really
like
it,
so
you
buy
it,
and
you
get
out
quicker.
