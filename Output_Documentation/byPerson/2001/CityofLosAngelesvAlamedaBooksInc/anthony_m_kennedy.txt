w-
what
is
your
principal
argument
in
opposition
to
the
rationale
in
the
court
of
appeals?
i
i
i
have
the
feeling
we're
t-
not
letting
you
make
the
the
principal
argument
here
that
you
wanted
to
make.

and
and
where
i'm
a
little
confused
is,
at
the
at
the
beginning
of
this
segment
of
the
argument,
when
we
began
focusing
on
this
question,
i
i
thought
you
said
something
to
the
effect
that
we
can't
show
this
empirically,
and
i
was
surprised.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
you
were
going
to
tell,
but
you
you
your...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
th-
but
this
whole
question
is
something
that's
secondary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
this
dual
business
draws
more
people,
and
whether
or
not
there's
an
empirical
basis
for
it.

the
arcade
because
it
didn't
draw
any
more
people?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
be
true
if
you
interpreted
secondary
effects
as
just
this
look
that
the
neighborhood
has
by
having
s-
the
businesses
strung
along
the
block,
but
if
secondary
effects
is
also
the
number
of
people
come
who
loiter,
who
who
who
drive
around,
who
who
c-
who
c-
concentrate
outside.
