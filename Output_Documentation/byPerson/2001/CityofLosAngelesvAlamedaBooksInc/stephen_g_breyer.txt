i'd
i'd
like
to
ask
you
i'll
assume
with
you
for
the
moment
you
don't
need
any
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
in
fact,
there
is
no
space
limitation,
i
would
repeat
my
question,
that
it
seems
a
fortiori
if
you
can
have
a
bookstore
of
gigantic
size,
or
an
arcade
of
gigantic
size,
but
you
can't
have
the
two
together,
even
of
a
little
size,
so
i
don't
i'm
not
talking
about
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
can
you
explain
i'm
just
trying
to
get
back
to
the
main
point
here,
i
at
least
as
i
understand
it,
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
don't
assume
i
know
a
lot
of
the
detail
that
you
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
were
a
meat
store
which
said,
over-the-counter
is
one
thing,
at
the
restaurant
is
another
of
course
we
could
do
it
a
million
ways.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we
have
to
do
it
some
way,
and
so
forget
whether
there's
evidence
or
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
say,
either
way,
we're
just
trying
to
have
a
reasonable
definition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
bad
analogy,
because
auto
places
are
not
try
liquor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
assume
it
in
their
favor
that
way,
and
then
argue...
