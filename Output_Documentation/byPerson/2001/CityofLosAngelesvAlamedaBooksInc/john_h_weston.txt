mr.
john
h.
weston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
h.
weston
justice
justice
scalia,
you'll
you'll...
mr.
john
h.
weston
you'll
pardon
me
for
not
adopting
the
reference
of
the
court
in
phrasing
the
nature
of
the
business,
but
in
fact
the
opposite
is
quite
true.
mr.
john
h.
weston
please.
mr.
john
h.
weston
right.
mr.
john
h.
weston
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
but
the
point,
the
use
of
the
term,
adult
business,
was
in
the
way
that
los
angeles
defined
a
use,
and
that
if
the
court
will
continue
a
little...
mr.
john
h.
weston
no,
it
it
it
it
with
all
respect,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
weston
up
until
a
very
recent
time
in
los
angeles
history,
one
could
carry
up
to
fourty-nine
percent
of
materials
in
one
store
and
not
be
deemed
to
be
an
adult
bookstore.
mr.
john
h.
weston
no
that...
mr.
john
h.
weston
no,
what
i'm
referring
to
is
california
court
decisions
which
had
interpreted
the
phrase,
substantial
number,
amount
of
retail
stock
in
trade.
mr.
john
h.
weston
law,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
weston
i-
the
term
came
fro-
was
an
identical
terminology
utilized
in
many,
many,
ordinances
throughout
the
state
of
california.
mr.
john
h.
weston
absolutely,
and
in
fact
it's
interesting
to
note,
because
we've
spoken
about
hart
this
morning,
that
the
north
carolina
statute
in
hart
was
one
that
pegged
the
definition
of
a
retail
bookstore
as
a
preponderance.
mr.
john
h.
weston
the
next
sentence,
you-
,
justice
scalia,
prior
to
june
of
nineteen
ninety-one,
the
majority
of
the
items
available
for
retail
sale
at
highland
books
were
of
a
nonadult
variety.
mr.
john
h.
weston
justice
scalia,
forgive
me,
i
can
only
tell
you
what
the
,
what
the
circumstances
were.
mr.
john
h.
weston
forgive
me,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
want
to
belabor
the
point
but
that's
not
a
fair
reading
of
it.
mr.
john
h.
weston
stock
in
trade
of
the
retail
establishment.
mr.
john
h.
weston
at
the
time,
in
los
angeles,
it
was
not...
mr.
john
h.
weston
the
fourty-nine
percent
of
adult
retail
material
did
acted
to
let
me
,
if
i
may
phrase
it
the
other
way.
mr.
john
h.
weston
fifty-one
percent
of
stock
in
trade
at
a
business
in
los
angeles,
if
it
was
adult,
made
that
store
adult,
even
if
it
was
twenty
thousand
total
items,
and
virtually
t-,
and
nearly
ten
thousand
of
them
had
nothing
to
do
with
sexually
oriented...
mr.
john
h.
weston
the
record
does
not
reflect
that,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
john
h.
weston
a-
i-
if
i
may,
as
in
hart,
mr.
wiener's
initial
businesses,
as
they
were
initially
constituted,
did
not
conflict
with
the
multiple
use
provision,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
a
hundred
percent
of
the
videotapes
viewed
in
them
were
adult,
and
fourty-nine
percent
or
up
to
fourty-nine
percent
of
the
retail
items
available
for
sale
were
also
adult.
mr.
john
h.
weston
that
did
not
constitute
two
adult
uses
under
california
law
at
that
time,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
law
was
in
hart,
that
it
was
perfectly
permissible
to
have
a
hundred
percent
adult
arcade
material,
and
fourty-nine
percent
retail
books,
videos
and
so
forth,
and
that
would
not
have
conflicted
with
the
prohibition
in
hart.
mr.
john
h.
weston
right.
mr.
john
h.
weston
certainly.
mr.
john
h.
weston
well...
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
initially.
mr.
john
h.
weston
let's
take
a
look
at
that
one.
mr.
john
h.
weston
sure.
mr.
john
h.
weston
i'm
not
quite
sure
about
drawing
more
people.
mr.
john
h.
weston
no,
it
wasn't
people,
it
was
the
notion
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
and
if
we
return
to
young
versus
american
mini
theatres,
there
is
at
least
there's
some
indication
in
young
that
it's
not
simply
a
question
of
people,
but
rather,
what
is
the
perception
from
the...
mr.
john
h.
weston
certainly.
mr.
john
h.
weston
of
course
not,
your
honor,
and
for
example,
if
the
city,
as
it
suggests,
which
we
do
not
agree
with,
really
thought
i
i
i
i
don't
mean
to
cast
aspersions
on
the
city.
mr.
john
h.
weston
there
are
a
number
of
responses
to
that,
and
and
and
they
require
a
bit
of
e-
articulation.
mr.
john
h.
weston
different,
in
as,
justice
scalia,
from
a
single
seven
eleven
store
that
says,
bananas
for
sale,
ninety-nine
cents
today,
rutabagas
a
dollar
and
a
half,
and
coca-colas
on
sale...
mr.
john
h.
weston
that's
a
that's
a
very
fair
and
good
question,
and
i've
been
thinking
about
that
one
for
a
long,
long
time,
and
i
think
the
easy
answer
to
it
is
simply
that
with
respect
to
the
massage
parlor,
there
would
be
no
first
amendment
interest
to
protect,
and
therefore
it
wouldn't
raise
the
question.
mr.
john
h.
weston
a-,
and
in
fact
i
did
say
that
in
fw
pbs
versus
city
of
dallas,
when
one
of
the
three
components
was
an
adult
motel,
but
interestingly
and
and
and
i'll
try
to
address
the
combination
question,
but
interestingly,
and
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
makes
the
la
su-
study
suspect
to
begin
with,
is
that
of
the
eighty-eigt
adult
uses
that
were
focused
on
by
the
police
department
and
the
planning
department
in
hollywood,
eigh-,
fourty-one
of
them
i
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
h.
weston
no,
you're
you're
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
wasn't
a
challenge
specifically
to
it,
but
as
we...
mr.
john
h.
weston
the
specific
challenge
that
was
made
was
whether
the
study
supported
the
city's
stated
purpose
that
in
combining
a
bookstore
and
an
arcade
in
one
establishment,
in
one
physical
structure,
gene-
caused
the
kinds
of
problems,
the
only
problems
which
the
study
evaluated
and
found
and,
in
fact,
in
the
city's
own
s-
papers
it
makes
clear,
and
we
have
set
this
forth
in
page
two
of
the
respondent's
appendix,
at
at,
we
we
note
to
it,
rather,
in
joint
appendix
one
oh
nine,
that
on
the
contrary,
this
st-
the...
mr.
john
h.
weston
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
h.
weston
forgive
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
h.
weston
right,
mr.
john
h.
weston
i
would
i
t-
t-
i
would
one
would
think
that
the
same
kind
of
analogy
as
we
have
offered
here
would
be
present,
that
with
a
motion
picture
theater
and
a
bookstore
there
would
appear
to
be
no
logical
suggestion
that
the
two
of
them
would
generate
any
greater
secondary
effects
than
the
motion
picture
theater
alone.
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
separate
ownership
is
what
constitutes
the
the
vice
aimed
at
at
the
ordinance.
mr.
john
h.
weston
[inaudible]
mr.
john
h.
weston
i'm
not
aware
of
any
data
that
would
suggest
that
the
combination
would
the
combination
in
in,
justice
stevens,
in
in
your
hypothetical
that
a
theater
and
a
bookstore
together,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
data
that
would
lead
one
to
reasonably
conclude
that
the
combination
of
a
retail
use
in
a
motion
picture
theater
would
generate
more
secondary
effects
than
what
i
assume
would
be
the
more
intense
use,
the
motion
picture
theater
operating
alone.
mr.
john
h.
weston
i
think
that's
fair,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
john
h.
weston
with
all
respect,
justice
souter,
i
must
question
the
hypothesis
that
it
is
the
clientele
that
will
cause
the
problems.
mr.
john
h.
weston
don't
think
so
in
this
instance,
because
if
that
were,
in
fact,
the
hypothesis
of
the
city,
surely,
with
all
of
the
thought
that
they
have
given
to
this,
there
would've
been
an
absolute
size
limitation
or
a
square
footage
limitation
that
was
part
of
the
legislation
to
deal
just
with
that
problem,
but
they
haven't.
mr.
john
h.
weston
a-
and
i
suppose
we'll
be
back...
mr.
john
h.
weston
not
not
at
all,
justice
souter.
