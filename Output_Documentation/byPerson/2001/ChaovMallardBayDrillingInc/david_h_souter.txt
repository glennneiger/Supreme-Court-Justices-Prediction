justice
david
h.
souter
--that...
that
view
is
also
expressed
in
the...
in
the
joint
agreement.
what...
could
you
tell
me...
i
should
know
this,
but
i
just
don't...
how
was
the
joint
agreement
promulgated,
if
it
was?
or
is
it
simply
just
a
private
memorandum
of
understanding
exchanged
between
the
two
agencies?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
the
reason
you
say
we
don't
have
to
get
into
the
distinction
between
the...
the
hazard
view
and
the
area
view
is
that
the
area
view
has
been
interpreted,
i
think
as
you
put
it,
narrowly
to
take
into
consideration
the
particular
area
in
which
the
particular
hazard
occurs.
is
that
about--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
guess
my
only
question
is,
given
that
narrow
interpretation,
i
wonder
if
there
is
all
that
much
difference
between
the
hazard
view
and
the...
and
the
area
view
as
it
has
been...
been
stated.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
is
this
for
uninspected
vessels?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
before
you
get
into
that,
i...
i
just
want
to
touch
base
on
one
thing.
your...
your
argument...
your
response
to
justice
kennedy,
as
i
understand
it,
depends
on
the
point
that
you
made
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
if
they
are
regulating
marine
toilets,
then
they
are
regulating
for
purposes
of...
of
excluding
osha
jurisdiction.
if
they're
regulating
in...
in
a
later
example
that
you
used,
running
lights
when
the
barge
is
being
towed,
then
they're
regulating
to
the
exclusion
of
osha.
period.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
the
essence
of
your
argument,
and
as
i
understand
it,
in
response
to
justice
kennedy,
just
as...
as
in
response
to
the
chief.
am
i
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
a...
a
kind
of
contrary
parade
of
horribles
to
yours
if...
if
we
were
to
accept
the
fifth
circuit
view,
and
that
is
assuming
that
the
coast
guard
regulates
running
lights
and
marine
sanitation
devices,
as
they
were
called,
and
things
like
that
and
does
nothing
more,
and
it
does
nothing
more
than
it
purports
to
do
right
now?
there's
an
enormous
gap
in...
in
safety
coverage
for
a
whole
class
of
workers.
it
seems
to
me
very
odd
that
congress,
in
writing
the...
the
statute
that
we're
dealing
with,
would
have
intended
such
a
kind
of
a
huge
gap
in
safety
coverage.
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
they...
on
your
theory,
if
they...
if
the
coast
guard
regulates
running
lights,
osha
can
do
absolutely
nothing
about
blowouts
like
this,
and
that
seems
to
me
a
pretty
big
gap.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
were...
if
that
were...
i
mean,
if
that
were
the
answer
to
my
problem,
i
would
have
expected
congress
to
tell
the
coast
guard
not
only
that
it
may
regulate,
but
that
it
must.
i
would
have
expected
some
statute
that
would
in...
in
effect,
have...
have
required
or
have
extended
as
a
matter
of
law
coast
guard
regulation
regardless
of
the
coast
guard's
discretion.
but
we
have
nothing
like
that.
what
we
have,
on
your
theory,
is
regulation
of
running
lights
by
the
coast
guard
means
safety
in
blowout
situations
is
not
covered
by
anything.
and...
and
that's
what
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
congress
could
have
intended.
justice
david
h.
souter
congress
apparently
has...
has
not
been...
been
particularly
concerned
about
the...
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
this
statute
and
the...
to
the
effect
of
the...
osha
jurisdiction.
and
i
gather
that
has
been
a...
a
subject
of...
of
published
standards
for
what?
15
years,
25
years
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
if...
if
you
say,
well,
if
congress
doesn't
like
it,
congress
can
do
something
about
it,
congress
could
do
something
about
the...
the
administrative
position
and
it
hasn't
done
anything
about
it,
which
suggests
that
that's
a...
a
good
reason
behind
the
rule
of
deference.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
say
this
is
an
unambiguous
statute
despite
the...
the
presence
of
the
word
exercise
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but...
as
i
understand
your
theory
now,
it
wouldn't
matter
even
if
they
had
not
exercised
it.
