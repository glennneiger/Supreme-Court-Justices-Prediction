well,
mr.
roberts,
the
coast
guard
does
have
regulations,
though,
that
require
an
emergency
plan
and
fire
control
devices.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
if...
if
the
coast
guard
has
regulations
that
try
to
contain
a
hazardous
event,
after
it
occurs,
as
opposed
to
regulations
trying
to
prevent
it
in
the
first
place,
do
you
say
that
the
containment
approach
just
doesn't
qualify
under
this
statute
as
a
coast
guard
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
mr.
roberts,
it
seemed
to
me
here
the
administrative
law
judge
seemed
to
say
that
the
osha
regulations
were
not
preempted
because
the
coast
guard
didn't
require
precisely
the
same
thing
that
osha
did.
and
i
would
have
thought
it
was
a
much
more
general
proposition,
that
if
the
coast
guard
adopted
some
general
regulations
in
this
area,
that's
enough,
and
that
you
wouldn't
look
to
see
how
closely
osha's
regs
matched
in
every
detail
the
coast
guard
regs.
what
is
the
government's
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
apparently
both
the
coast
guard
and
osha
agree
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
it
sounds
like
the
alj's
description
was
probably...
didn't
get
it
quite
right,
and
i
take
it
that
your
opposing
counsel
here
concedes
as
much.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
where
are
you...
you're
reading
from
a
coast
guard
regulation?
