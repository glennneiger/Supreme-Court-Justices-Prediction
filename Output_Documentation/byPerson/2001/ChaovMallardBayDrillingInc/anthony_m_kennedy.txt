fire
safety
regulations
are...
are
different
from...
from--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--may
i...
may
i
interrupt
you
right
there?
and
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
this
whole
answer.
does...
osha
doesn't
apply
just
as
to
those
measures...
just
as
to
those
working
conditions
on
those
vessels
that
have
been
covered?
suppose
osha
has
a
regulation
about
kitchens.
you
have
to
have
guards
on
the
carving
knives
or
something.
and
the
coast
guard,
on
an
inspected
vessel,
does
not
have
that
provision.
under
the
scheme,
as
it
works,
can
osha
regulate
the...
the
kitchen
knife
problem,
or...
or
is
it
completely
displaced?
because--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--getting
back
to
the
inspected
vessels,
because
this
might
have
a
bearing
on...
on
how
we
write
the
opinion
in
this
case,
even
though
it's
uninspected.
are
there
instances
in
which
there
are...
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
between
the
coast
guard
and
osha
on
inspected
vessels?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
hope
i
didn't
take
you
too
far
off
the
track.
you
were
talking
about
inspected
and
uninspected
vessels.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
can
go
back
to
inspected
vessels
just
for
1
minute.
i
thought
the
answer
you
would
give
me
to
the
question
about,
you
know,
the
kitchen
knives
would
be
just
what
you
told
justice
o'connor
now
with
reference
to
the
uninspected
vessels,
that
we
look
to
see
if
the
working
condition
is
regulated.
or
maybe
i
just
misunderstood
your
answer.
was
your
answer
to
the
effect
that
on
inspected
vessels,
generally,
all
working
conditions
are
regulated,
or
at
least
they've
been
looked
at
and
there's
been
a
decision
not
to
regulate
and
that's
sufficient
to
displace
osha?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
best
understanding--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
that
that
argument...
that
position
of
the
government
is
just
consistent
with
the
statute
because
the...
the
statute
applies
to
working
conditions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i...
i
would
be
surprised
if
the
coast
guard
had
regulations
on...
on
drilling
barges
that
related
to...
to
blowout
preventers,
mud
cavity
depressors,
chemical
mixturing
material
for
mud,
drilling
bits.
that's...
that's
osha
stuff
not
coast
guard
stuff.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
don't
know
what
that
has
to
do
with
the
complexity
of
a...
of
a
well
drilling
operation.
it's
just
night
and
day.
there
are
separate
working
conditions
that
prevail
to
oil
field
operations
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but...
but
this
applies
to
working
conditions
that...
that
i've
just
mentioned.
the
statute
says,
with
respect
to
working
conditions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that...
that's
osha's
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
there
some
drilling
platforms
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
which
are
registered
vessels
and
so
are
completely
under
the
coast
guard's
jurisdiction
as
to
drilling--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--on
those
vessels,
if
the
coast
guard
chose,
could
it
allow
osha
a
specific
regulation
of
a
concurrent...
sort
of
a
concurrent
jurisdiction?
