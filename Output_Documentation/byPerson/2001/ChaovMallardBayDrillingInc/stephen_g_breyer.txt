justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
they
said...
the
government
said,
for
example,
in
respect
to
the...
the
regulations
that
you
cited
having
to
do
with
safety
on
page
13--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
they
said
that
part
27,
which
is
what
you
were
quoting
from,
applies
only
to
towing
vessels,
that
it
didn't
apply
to
barges.
so,
that's
what
they
said
in
their
reply
brief.
and
you're
dealing
with
a
barge.
so,
when
we
look
through
this,
it
seemed
to
me
that
their
claim...
and
i'd
ask
you
if
that
isn't
right...
that...
that
the
only...
the
only
coast
guard
things
that
seem
to
apply
at
all
to
the
barges,
an
uninspected
barge,
had
to
do
with
fire
extinguishers,
life
preservers,
ventilation
for
tanks
and
engines,
and
also
a
general
requirement
that
when
there's
an
accident,
they
look
into
it
to
see
if
a
law
has
been
violated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
which
are
the
ones,
in
addition
to
those
that
do
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
just
saying
which
ones
apply--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--other
than
the
ones
i
listed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
you
know,
they
go
through
this
in
a
big
appendix,
and...
and
are
they
wrong
in
their
appendix?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which...
which
part
of
the
appendix
is
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
160.
is
there
any
other
one
that
you
think
that
they're
wrong
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
better
tell
me
the...
i
mean,
you
know,
i'm
just
checking
them
and
i'll
look
up
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
they...
let's
say
a
few
minimal
applications...
applied
to
the
belden,
all
right,
which
is,
i
take
it,
your...
your
barge,
to
mr.
belden.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
have
a
big
appendix
designed
to
show
that.
and
if
their
appendix
is
right,
they're
right.
so,
i
want
to
check
the
ones
that
you
disagree
with
about
that
appendix,
so
i
can
go
back
and
look
them
up.
what
i've
looked
up
so
far,
i've
checked
section
160.
i'll
go
look
that
up.
is
there
any
other
thing
i
should
check?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
and
they
went
through
those,
and
they
went
and
said
that
every
one
of
those
that
you
say,
by
and
large,
don't
apply
with
certain
exceptions.
so,
i'm
just
going
to
make
my
work
a
little
easier--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
find
out
what
i
do
have
to
look
up
and
what
i
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
antitrust
division
and
the
ftc
do
it
all
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
illegal
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
just
wondered
how
general
statement
was.
you
mean
in
this
instance
they
can't
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
why
i
wondered
maybe
it
has
to
do
how
comprehensive
the
regulation
was,
and
that's
what
i
was
interested
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
word
is
exercise.
the
word
is
exercise
in
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
if
they
decide
not
to
exercise
their
authority,
then
i
guess
they're
not
exercising
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
can
choose
not
to
exercise
it,
i
suppose.
if
they're
not
exercising
it,
they're
not.
then
the
coast
guard
can
come
in.
i
mean,
that's
what
the
statute
says.
