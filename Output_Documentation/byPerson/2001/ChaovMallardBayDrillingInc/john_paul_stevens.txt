no,
counsel,
but
isn't
it
true
that
what
it
really
boils
down
to
is
whether
rules
of
the
road
or
navigation
lights
are
regulations
of
working
conditions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
say
about
his
argument
that,
yes,
oh,
that
may
be
true
in
writing,
but
in
fact
the
people
who
did
investigate
this
accident
was
the
coast
guard?
justice
john
paul

mr.
roberts,
how
far
can
a
memorandum
of
understanding
go?
supposing
two
agencies,
just
the
two
secretaries
or
whoever
is
representing,
sit
down
and
say,
let's...
let's
just
divide
up
this
area...
there
can
be
some
conflict...
and
just
sign
a
very
simple
understanding
that,
you
know,
you
regulate
a
and
i'll
regulate
b.
how
much
authority
should
a
court
give
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
involves
an
oil
and
gas
exploration
barge
known
as
rig
52
which
belongs
to
the
respondent,
mallard
bay
drilling.
while
its
crew
was
drilling
a
well
in
the
territory
of
waters
of
louisiana,
rig
52
exploded
as
a
result
of
a
gas
leak.
four
members
of
the
crew
were
killed
and
two
were
injured.
the
united
states
coast
guard
investigated
the
incident
but
did
not
accused
mallard
bay
of
violating
any
coast
guard
regulations.
the
coast
guard’s
report
explained
its
limits
however
by
noting
that
rig
52
was
an
uninspected
vessel
as
opposed
to
an
inspected
vessel,
which
meant
that
the
barge
was
not
comprehensively
regulated
by
the
coast
guard.
based
largely
on
information
from
the
guard's
report,
the
occupational
safety
and
health
administration
cited
mallard
bay
for
three
violations
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act.
in
the
osha
administered
proceeding,
mallard
bay
challenge
osha’s
jurisdiction
to
issue
this
citations,
arguing
that
the
guard
possess
exclusive
statutory
authority
to
regulate
occupational
safety
and
health
standards
on
vessels
in
navigable
waters.
the
administrative
law
judge
rejected
the
challenge
and
assessed
the
penalty
against
mallard
bay
for
its
violations
of
the
act.
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
coast
guard
possessed
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
working
conditions
of
board
vessels
such
as
rig
52,
thereby
precluding
osha
from
applying
its
regulations
to
both
inspected
and
uninspected
vessels.
because
other
courts
of
appeals
had
not
endorsed
such
extensive
pre-emption
of
osha’s
regulation,
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict.
we
reversed
the
decision
below
and
conclude
that
osha
had
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
citations
against
mallard
bay.
the
statute
bars
osha
from
regulating
working
conditions
“with
respect
to
which
other
federal
agencies
exercise
statutory
authority
to
prescribe
or
enforce
standards
or
regulations
affecting
occupational
safety
and
health.”
whether
osha’s
jurisdiction
is
preempted
in
a
given
case
thus
depends
on
whether
another
federal
agency
has
exercise
its
authority
to
regulate
the
working
conditions
in
questions.
as
its
language
of
the
statute
makes
clear,
mere
possession
by
another
agency
of
unexercised
authorities
is
not
enough
to
displace
osha’s
jurisdiction,
nor
is
another
federal
agencies
minimal
exercise
of
authority
with
respect
to
a
limited
class
of
working
conditions.
the
parties
do
not
dispute
that
the
coast
guards
comprehensive
regulation
of
inspected
vessels
has
preempted
osha’s
authority
to
regulate
those
vessels.
however,
concerning
uninspected
vessels
like
rig
52,
the
coast
guards
regulatory
authority
is
much
more
limited.
in
this
case,
the
working
conditions
that
were
the
subject
of
osha’s
citations
related
to
inland
drilling
operations
on
uninspected
vessels.
because
the
coast
guard
has
neither
affirmatively
regulated
such
working
conditions
nor
asserted
comprehensive
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
them
and
uninspected
vessels.
the
coast
guard
has
not
exercised
its
preemptive
authority.
as
a
result,
the
jurisdiction
is
not
preempted
and
as
i
say
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal.
except
for
justice
scalia
who
did
not
participate
in
the
decision,
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
