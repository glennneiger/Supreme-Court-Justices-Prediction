mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
out
of
an
explosion
that
killed
four
employees
on
a
drilling
barge
on
the
inland
waters
of
louisiana.
the
barge
is
not
inspected
for
certification
by
the
coast
guard,
which
therefore
has
almost
no
regulations
that
address
occupational
safety
and
health
on
the
barge.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
coast
guard
has,
nonetheless,
exercised
authority
over
the
working
conditions
on
the
barge
so
as
to
displace
application
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
not...
not
that
apply
to
this
vessel,
your
honor.
the...
the
only
occupational...
the
only
regulations
addressed
to
occupational
safety
and
health
issues
on
this
barge
that
have
been
identified
by
respondent
and
its
amici
are
regulations
that
address
risk
from
the
marine
sanitation
devices,
or
the
toilets,
on
the
vessel.
the
only
other
regulation
of
which
i'm
aware
that
deals
with
occupational
safety
and
health
is
a
regulation
that...
that
addresses
operating
the
vessel
while
intoxicated.
those
regulations...
there
are
regulations
that
address
emergency
procedures
on
inspected
vessels,
but
not
on
this
type
of
uninspected
vessel.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
no.
there
are
no
fire
and
safety
regulations
on...
on
this
vessel,
your
honor.
there
are
some
specific
fire
and
safety
regulations
required
by
some
statutes
on
particular
types
of
vessels,
particularly
vessels
propelled
by
machinery.
those
are
the
ones
covered
by...
by
46
u.s.c.
4102.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor,
but...
but
with
respect
to...
to
this
vessel,
as
i...
as
i
was
saying,
they
don't
have
such
regulations.
the...
the
containment
approach
would...
would
qualify,
although
if...
if
a
regulation
was
addressed
to
preventing
a
fire
for
occurring,
that
would
address
a...
a
different...
a
different
hazard
than
a
regulation
that
was
addressed
to
responding
to
that
after
the
fire
had
occurred
and...
and
could
be
put
out.
but...
but
here,
the
coast
guard
has
not
exercised
statutory
authority
over
the
working
conditions
involved
in
this
case,
and
under
section
4(b)(1)
of
the
act,
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
first,
to...
to
start
at
the...
the
beginning
of
your
question,
there
are
certain
categories
of
vessels
that
are
listed
under
the
statute
as
inspected
vessels
and
with
respect...
under
coast
guard
statutes
as
inspected
vessels.
on
those
vessels,
the
coast
guard
inspects
them
at
the
beginning
and
then
periodically
for
certification
that
they're
in
satisfactory
condition,
fit
for
the
service
for
which
they're
intended
and
seaworthy.
the
coast
guard
also
has
comprehensive
regulatory
authority
over
those
vessels,
and
it's
exercised
that
authority
comprehensively
over
those
vessels.
so,
for
those
vessels,
the
secretary
and
the
coast
guard
agree
the...
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
doesn't
apply.
then
there's
another
set
of
vessels--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it's
completely
displaced
on
the
inspected
vessels
because
the
coast
guard
has
comprehensive
authority
over
those
and
has
exercised
its
comprehensive
authority
on
the
inspected
vessels
by
promulgating
comprehensive
regulations,
and
those
regulations
include
specific
ones
addressing
specific
hazards,
as
well
as
general
provisions
such
as
the
one
that
i
was
referring
to
that
requires
that
the
vessels
be
fit
for
the
service
that
they're
intended
and
safe
and
seaworthy.
and
therefore,
with
respect
to
those,
all
the
working
conditions
are
covered
either
by
the
specifics
or
by
the
general,
and
the
osh
act
does
not
apply.
but
what
we're
concerned
with
in
this
case
is
a...
is
a
vessel
on
which...
over
which
the
coast
guard
has
much
more
limited
authority
and
with
respect
to
which
it...
it
has
authority
to
and
has
regulated
only
very
specific
conditions.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
not
with
respect
to
regulation
in
terms
of
setting
occupational
safety
and
health
standards
and
enforcing
occupational
safety
and
health
standards.
there
is,
with
respect
to
reporting
or
investigation
on
inspected
vessels...
i
mean,
not...
no.
i
guess
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
to
get
back
to
the
uninspected
vessels
that...
that
justice
ginsburg
had
asked
about
and
which
is
what
we...
we
have
in
this
case,
on
those
vessels,
there's
very
limited
authority.
it
flows
from
specific
statutory
grants
that
deal
with
specific
items
of
safety.
and
therefore,
the
coast
guard
regulation
of
working
conditions
on
those
vessels
is
spotty,
depending
on
the
statutory
grants
of
authority.
and
as
i
said
before,
on...
this
particular
type
of
inspected
vessel
is
a...
is
an
inland
drilling
barge,
and
on
this
barge
there...
the
statutory
authority
doesn't
give
the
coast
guard
authority
to
require
fire
extinguishers
or...
or
those
kind
of
things,
and
it
gives
the
coast
guard
no
authority
over
the
hazards
from
oil
and
gas
drilling,
which
are
the
hazards
involved
in
this...
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
some
uninspected
are
more
closely
watched,
and
we...
we
would
submit
that
no
uninspected
vessel
is
comprehensively
watched
as
to
occupational
safety
and
health.
but
that...
the
court
doesn't
need
to...
to
get
into
that
to...
to
resolve
this
case.
all...
all
we're
asking
here
is
that
the
court
reject
the
holding
of
the
fifth
circuit,
which
is
that
there's
an
industry-wide
exemption
for
all
seamen
on
all
vessels
from
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act,
even
in
situations
where
the
coast
guard
has
not
regulated
the
particular
working
conditions
on
that
vessel
and
the
particular
working
conditions
that
result
in
the
occupational
and
safety
and
health
citation
in
the...
in
that
case.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
there
are
different
types
of...
of
uninspected
vessels,
and
the...
depending
on
the
type,
different
sets
of
regulations
apply
to
them.
and
the
vessel
operators
are
well
aware
of
what
regulations
apply
to
them.
but...
but
on
all
uninspected
vessels,
it
doesn't
really
matter
whether
it's
little
or
more,
because
the
way
the
statutory
scheme
works
is
that
the
coast
guard
regulations
that
govern
them
apply
to
them.
and
the
osha
standards
apply
to
the
extent
that
the
working
conditions
are
not
covered
by
coast
guard
regulations.
and
that
comes
from
the...
the
language
of
section
4(b)(1)
of
the
osh
act,
which
makes
clear
that
displacement
of
the
act
is
limited
to
those
working
conditions
with
respect
to
which
other
agencies
exercise
authority
to
prescribe
or
enforce
occupational
safety
and
health
standards.
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
government's
view
is
that
you
don't
look
to
see
if
there's
precisely
the
same
regulation
in
precisely
the
same
manner
of
the
same...
the
same
degree
of
stringency.
you
look
to
see
whether
the...
whether
there
is
a
regulation
on
the
part
of
the
coast
guard
that
addresses
the
same
working
conditions,
the
same
hazards
that
are
involved.
and
if
there
are,
then
no
matter
whether
that's
more
stringent,
less
stringent,
or
goes
about
it
in
a
different
way,
it's
displaced.
but
here
there's
no
regulation
that
addresses
this
hazard--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
they
agree.
and
the
agencies,
not
only
the
coast
guard
and
osha,
but
other
agencies
where
this
comes
up,
are...
have
been
in
agreement.
these
kinds
of
disputes
about
coverage
haven't
arisen
because
the
agencies
have
been
disputing
about
what...
when
it
applies
and
when
it
doesn't
and
what
working
conditions
are
covered
by
their
different
regulations.
they've
arisen
when
employers
have
asserted
that
the
osh
act
doesn't
apply
so
that
nobody...
there
would
be
no
regulations
covering--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
we
didn't...
we
didn't
need
to
resolve
any
dispute
because
there's
been
a
longstanding
understanding
between
the
two
agencies,
based
on
the
language
of
the
osh
act,
as
to
how
the...
how
the
two...
the
authority
of
each
agency
interacts
with
the
other.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
it's
the
same--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--my
answer
was
intended
to
say
the
same
thing,
that
at
bottom,
the
same
test
applies
whether
the
particular
working
conditions
have
been
addressed,
but
with
respect
to
inspected
vessels,
the
working
conditions
have
been
addressed
comprehensively
by
the
coast
guard
through
specific
regulations
and
through
general
regulations.
and
so,
there
aren't...
there
aren't
any
gaps
where
workers
would
be
unprotected
that
the
osh
act
would
need
to...
to
step
in.
but
on
uninspected
vessels,
the...
the
situation
is
quite...
quite
the
reverse
and
almost
the
polar
opposite
where
there
aren't
just
little
gaps,
but
there
are
potentially
whole
vessels
that
are
almost
completely
unregulated
with
respect
to
occupational
safety
and
health.
so,
the
industry-wide
exemption
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
crafted
here
would,
as
a
result,
leave
many
workers
unprotected
from
many
hazardous
conditions
and...
and
really
frustrate
the
express
purpose
of
the
act
which
is
to
assure,
insofar
as
possible
that
every
working
man
and
woman
in
the
nation
has
safe
and
healthful
working
conditions.
and
moreover,
to...
even
if
there
was
any
ambiguity
about
how
the
statutory
scheme
should
work,
from
looking
at
its
text
and
from
looking
at
the...
and
from
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
act,
the
secretary
has
interpreted
the
act
this
way
for
30
years.
it's
been
the
secretary's
longstanding
and
consisted
view.
it's
reflected
in
citations
over
those
30
years
and
regulations
that
the
secretary
promulgated
in
1972
in
a
statutorily
mandated
report
to
congress
on
coordination
between
the
osh
act
and
other
laws
that
the
secretary
submitted
in
1980.
and
the
secretary's
view
would
be...
would
be
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
was
published
in
the...
in
the
federal
register
at...
at
the
time
that
it
was...
it
was
entered
into,
your
honor.
to...
to...
without...
without
belaboring
the
point,
turning
to
the
facts
that
are
here
briefly,
the
respondent
does
not
dispute
that
the
coast
guard
hasn't
addressed
the
particular
hazards
involved
here.
and
as
i
said
before,
the
only
regulations
that
respondent
and
amici
have...
have
pointed
to
that
address
the
working
conditions
here
are...
are
very
limited,
those
addressing
the
marine
sanitation
devices,
and
there
is
in
fact
almost
no
regulation
here,
so
that
under
any
understanding
of
the
term
working
conditions,
any
reasonable
understanding
of
what
working
conditions
is
under
the
statute,
the
coast
guard
hasn't
exercised
authority
over
the
working
conditions
here.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that's...
that's
one...
one
reason.
if...
if
the
area
view
was
interpreted
broadly,
it
would,
in
effect,
completely
eviscerate--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
act
because
it
would
mean
that
the
regulations
of
the
toilets
preempt
the...
any
regulation
of
the
vessel
and
expose
all
those...
all
the
hazards
that
might
exist
on
the
vessel
would
not
be
subject
to...
to
regulation.
so,
it
has
been
interpreted
narrowly.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
i...
i
think
that...
that
there
is
the
potential
for...
for
different
results
to
arise
between
the
two
views,
even
with
the...
the
narrow
interpretation
of...
of
the
area
view
because
the
area
is
identified,
say,
as
the...
the
atmosphere
on
the
boat.
the
atmosphere
might
be
regulated
by
the
coast
guard
with
respect
to
particular
injuries
that...
that
might
be
caused
by
problems
in
the
atmosphere
like
explosion,
which
it
isn't
here,
but
assume
that
it
were.
yet,
it
wouldn't
be
regulated
for...
for
other
problems
that
might
result
from
that
like
respiratory
problems,
particles
that
would
be
in
the
atmosphere
that
would
get
into
the...
the
workers'
lungs.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor.
not
that
it...
that
it
has
to
be
an
exact
duplicate,
but
that
it
has
to
address
the
same
injury,
the
same
kind
of
injury
from
the
same
source
in
essence.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
if...
if
the
coast
guard's
regulation
didn't
address
the
injury...
the
particular
injury
that
would
result
from
the
smoke,
that
the...
that
the
osha
regulation
was
trying
to--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--to
get
at.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
if
the
coast
guard
had
made
that
determination
and
expressly
concluded
that
a
regulation
of
that
was
not
warranted,
then
that
would
be
an
exercise
of
its
authority
over...
over
that
working
condition
and
the
osh
act
would
be
displaced.
but
there's
no...
no
contention
that...
that
that
is
what
happened
here,
and
there
couldn't
be
because
the
coast
guard
doesn't
even
have
authority
to
regulate
the
hazards
that
are
involved...
involved
here,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
with
the
exception
of
part
160,
which
doesn't
regulate
occupational
safety
and
health,
none
of
the
regulations
identified
by
respondent
applied
to
the
mr.
belden
as
is
explained
in
the...
in
the
appendix
in
our
reply
brief.
just
to...
just
to
briefly
mention
part
26,
which
he
started
about
the
emergency
checkoff
list,
that
specifically
applies
to
small
passenger
vessels
based
on
specific
authority
given
to
the
coast
guard
to
regulate
small
passenger
vessels
in
more
detail.
many
of
the
others
deal
with
navigational
issues
like
running
lights,
have
nothing
to
do
with
regulation
of
occupational
safety
and
health.
none
regulates
the
hazards
from
oil
and
gas
drilling.
section
14
u.s.c.
2
on
which
respondent
relies,
first
of
all,
as
justice
ginsburg
points
out,
that
only
goes
to
the
existence
of
authority,
not
to
the
exercise
of
it,
and
the
statute
is
very
clear
that...
that
the
other
agency
must
exercise
authority
to
displace
the
osh
act.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
coast
guard
has...
has
responsibility
for
investigating
marine
accidents.
investigative
authority
doesn't
necessarily
imply
that
you
have
regulatory
authority
as
the
national
transportation
safety
board
is
an
illustration
of.
congress
wanted
the
coast
guard
to...
to
investigate.
it
does.
if
it
finds
violations,
finds
situations
that
indicate
violations
of
other
agency
laws,
it
coordinates
with
those
agencies,
as
it
did
here,
and
those
agencies
take
appropriate
enforcement
action.
the
authority
to
investigate
accidents
after
they
happen,
even
if
they
might
have
been
caused
by
unsafe
working
conditions,
is
not
regulation
of
those
working
conditions,
and
it
doesn't
preempt
the...
preempt
the
osh
act.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the...
the
question
of
who
has
authority
here
is
governed
by
section
4(b)(1)
of
the
osh
act,
not
by
some
agreement
between
the...
coast
guard
and
osha.
that
agreement
reflects
the
coast
guard's
regulations
and
the
interpretation
of
the
osh
act
that
the
secretary--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
we
rely...
we
rely
on
the
text
of...
of
section
4(b)(1)
which
is...
is
quite
clear
that
it
displaces
the
osh
act
with
respect
to
particular
working
conditions.
that's
in
stark
contrast
to
the
fifth
circuit's
holding
here
that
there's
an
industry-wide
exemption
for
all
seamen
on
all
vessels
from
the
osh
act.
that's
the
approach
that
respondent
endorses,
admitting
that
regulation
of
the
toilets
would
preempt
regulation
of
the
act
altogether,
and
that
you
don't
even
need
to
regulate
that,
that...
that
the
osh
act
simply
doesn't
apply
because
respondent
mistakenly
believes
that
the
coast
guard
has
authority,
plenary
authority,
under
section
2,
when
the
coast
guard
has
never
interpreted
section
2
to
give
it
plenary
authority.
and
it's
repeatedly
gone
back
to
congress
to
get
specific
authority
to
address
specific
issues
on
particular
uninspected
vessels,
and
congress
has
given
the
coast
guard
that
authority,
which
indicates
that
neither
congress
nor
the
coast
guard
thought
section
2
gave
it
that
authority.
the...
the
secretary's
view
that
the
coast
guard
has
to
regulate
the
particular
working
conditions
at
issue
in
order
to
displace
the
osh
act
is
supported
by
the
text.
it's
supported
by
the
purpose
of
the
act.
it's
been
the
secretary's
longstanding
view.
it's
been
followed
by
all
the
other
circuits
except
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
second
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit,
the
eleventh
circuit,
with
due
respect
to
the
maritime
expertise
in
the
fifth
circuit,
those
circuits
also
have
a
great
deal
of
maritime...
of
maritime
expertise.
and
the
working
conditions
here,
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
are
not
maritime-specific.
they're
matters
over
which
osha
has
expertise,
and
4(b)(1)
allows
the
coast
guard
to
step
in
and
displace
the
osh
act
when
it
has
authority
and
when
it
believes
that
its
expertise
warrants
it
to
address
the
particular
working
conditions
that
are
at
issue.
the
coast
guard
doesn't
have
authority
here.
it
hasn't
exercised
authority
here,
and
the
osh
act
applies
here.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
a
drilling
vessel
that
went
to
the
outer
continental
shelf,
in
most
cases,
would
be
an
inspected
mobile
oil
drilling
unit,
which
the
coast
guard
has
comprehensive
regulations
covering.
the
coast
guard
also
has
regulations
specifically
addressed
to
all
facilities
at
the
outer
continental
shelf
which
include
a
general
duty
clause,
similar
to
the
osha
general
duty
clause,
that
requires
that
work
places
there
be
free
of...
of
recognized
hazards.
in
addition,
the
interior
department
has
some
regulatory
authority
out
there
specifically
related
to
mineral
drilling.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the...
it...
it
could
have
if
it...
if
it
hadn't
exercised
its
comprehensive
authority
over
those
vessels,
but
it
has
exercised
its
comprehensive
authority
over
those
vessels,
in
contrast
to
the
situation
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
