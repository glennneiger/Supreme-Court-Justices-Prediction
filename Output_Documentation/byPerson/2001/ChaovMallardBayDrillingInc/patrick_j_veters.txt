mr.
patrick
j.
veters
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
coast
guard
has
absolute
authority
to
regulate
uninspected
vessels,
as
well
inspected
vessels,
and
there's
not
one
iota
of
difference
between
the
two.
justice
o'connor,
if
i
could
go
to
your
question
earlier,
you're
absolutely
correct.
the
alj
in
this
case
said
that
we
did
not...
the
coast
guard
did
not
have
a
statute
that
mirrored
the
language
of...
of
the
osh
act.
as
a
result
thereof,
she
concluded
that
the
act
was
displaced.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
i
would
hope
so,
your
honor.
and,
your
honor,
to
get
right
to
the
point,
with
all
due
respect
to
counsel,
the
coast
guard
has
absolutely
regulated
emergency
response.
46
c.f.r.
26.
operators
of
inspected
vessels
must
prepare
and
post
an
emergency
checkoff
list.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
we'll
find
that
on
page
13
of
the
amicus
brief
on
behalf
of
the
awo,
your
honor.
they
had...
they
require
an...
quote,
an
emergency
checkoff
list.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
for
uninspected
vessels,
your
honor,
operators
of
uninspected
vessels
covering
emergencies,
including
rough
weather,
crossing
hazardous
bars,
man
overboard,
as
well
as
fire
at
sea.
we
have
a
parallel
regulation.
it
doesn't
read
verbatim
as
the
osh
act,
but
clearly
it
has
been
addressed.
but
to
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
that
is
not
even
required
by
the
coast
guard
for
preemption
purposes.
the
coast
guard
has
a
statute...
the
osh
act,
4(b)(1)
reads
that
it
will
not
apply
to
working
conditions
that
are...
so
long
as
the
other
federal
agency
exercises
statutory
authority.
the
coast
guard
has
exercised
statutory
authority.
it's
not
a
question
of
degrees
in
the
statute.
it's
not
light
exercise,
moderate
exercise,
or
heavy
exercise.
it's
once
there
has
been
exercise
by
a
federal
agency
such
as
the
coast
guard,
the
osh
act
is
displaced.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
that's...
that's
fairly
correct,
your
honor.
and...
and
the
only
question...
the
government
is
mischaracterizing
the
extent
of
regulation
in
this
case.
you
cannot
tell...
in
this
case,
the
coast
guard...
there
is
no
gap
in
coverage
for...
for
worker
safety.
the
coast
guard
stepped
in
and
investigated
a
serious
marine
accident
pursuant
to
46
u.s.c.
63.
we
had
multiple
deaths.
we
had
multiple
injuries.
we
had
property
damage
in
excess
of
$100,000.
three
coast
guard
investigators
came
out
over
a
6-month
period.
they
got
control
of
this
well,
of
this
blowout
situation,
and
they
exercised
their
authority.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
i
would
say
that's
an
extreme
example,
your
honor.
but,
yes--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--your
honor,
yes.
i
would
say
that
there
has
been
an
exercise
of
authority,
and
if...
if
osha
has
a
complaint,
it
is
not
properly
directed
to
the
court.
it's
properly
directed
to
congress
to
have
the
coast
guard
promulgate
regulations
that
address
the
needs
of
the
seamen.
that's
the
proper
complaint.
it's
not
for
this
court
to
step
in
and
give
osha...
carve
out
exception
after
exception
where
there
are
no
express
regulations.
if
i
may
refer
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
he's...
you're
absolutely
correct.
osha
gets...
osha
gets
their
jurisdiction
in
this
case
from
a
memorandum
of
understanding,
a
peace
treaty,
an
informal
memorandum
that
is
not
a
delegation
of
law.
that
memorandum
says,
your
honor...
it
says...
the
memorandum
of
understanding
says
nothing
in
this
mou
pertains
to
uninspected
vessels.
that's
what
it
says.
that
does
not
disclaim
coast
guard
regulation
of
inspected
vessels,
nor
does
it
cede
to
the
government
jurisdiction
over
uninspected
vessels.
your
example
about
the
kitchen
knife
is
absolutely
correct.
the
government
has
come
in
and
said
if
the
coast
guard
does
not
have
an
express
provision...
in
this
case,
we
did
not
have
an
express
provision
regarding
the
working
conditions
of
the
presence
of
natural
gas
in
the
atmosphere
of
an
inland
drilling
barge...
there's
no
such
creature.
if...
if
the
coast
guard
does
not
have
that
or
if
the
coast
guard
does
not
articulate
a
policy
that
they
will
not
regulate
the
presence
of
natural
gas
in
the
atmosphere
of
an
inland
drilling
barge,
then
osha
can
step
in
and
regulate
that.
osha
can
step--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
well,
your
honor,
they...
what
the
coast
guard
has
is
broad,
general
authority
according
to
14
u.s.c.
2,
and
they
can
board
an
uninspected
vessel.
they
can
inspect...
they
can
investigate
any
uninspected
vessel
on
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
they
can
seize
it
partially
or
seize
it
fully.
they
can
take
an
uninspected
barge
out
of
service
if
it
poses
a
danger
or
threat
to
property
or
persons.
it
can
even
sink
an
uninspected
barge
if
it's
a
threat
to
property
or...
or
life.
with
that
being
said,
the
coast
guard
does
not
have
to...
to
have
every
minute
regulation
that
tailors
that
of
the
osh
act
to...
to
assert
their
authority
in
this
case.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
yes,
sir.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
i
would
disagree.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
those
do
apply
under
the
subchapter
c
uninspected
vessels.
but
we
submit,
your
honor,
46
c.f.r.
24,
25,
and
26
apply
to
all
uninspected
vessels.
and
not
only
that,
your
honor,
the
important
thing
is
there
are
many
regulations
that
apply
to
both
uninspected
vessels--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--which
ones.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
your
honor--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--yes,
i
think
they're
reading--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--i
think
they're
reading
the...
the
statutes
too
narrowly,
your
honor.
i
would
submit
33
c.f.r.,
part
160.
it's...
that
governs
ports
and
waterways
safety.
it
applies
to
all
vessels.
that...
under
that
statute,
inspected
as
well
as
uninspected,
the
coast
guard
can
deny
entry
to
a
port.
it
can
seize
a
vessel
that
it
feels
is
operating
unsafely.
it
can
tell
the
operator
of
that
vessel
how
to
operate
that
vessel.
it
can
take
that
vessel
out
of
service.
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
come
under
the
subchapter
of
uninspected
vessels,
yet
the
authority
is
very
broad.
it's
just
like
the...
the
drug
testing
of
people
that
have
accidents,
your
honor.
any--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--yes.
i
think
the
collregs,
your
honor.
the...
the--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--okay.
your
honor,
i
don't
have
the...
the
collregs,
what
we
call
the
rules
of
the
road,
but
it's
the
navigational
rules
that
apply
to
vessels
as
well
as
uninspected
vessels.
clearly,
there
are
rules
that
apply
to
both
species.
these...
these
regulations
are
designed
to
prevent
collisions
and
to
prevent
accidents
and
injuries
to
seamen.
they...
that's
another
example
of
rules
articulated
that
are...
that
govern
the
working
conditions--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
your
honor,
i
don't
have
their
appendix
in
front
of
me,
but
yes,
i
would
go...
we
have...
we
have
a
list
of
regulations
that
we've...
we've
applied
to--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--oh,
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
your
honor,
we
would...
we
would
submit
that,
yes,
the
ones
we
talk
about
33
c.f.r.,
part
160
clearly
applies.
we
believe
46
c.f.r.
24,
part
24,
part
25,
part
26
apply.
we
believe
the
rules
of
the
road,
the
collreg,
related
to
navigation
apply.
we
believe
the...
the
regulations
concerning
drug
and
alcohol
testing,
46
c.f.r.,
part...
part
16...
they
apply.
we
believe
33
c.f.r.,
part
155;
33
c.f.r.,
part
81,
navigation
lights.
when
this
vessel
is
towed...
it's
a
non-self-propelled
barge...
when
it's
towed
out
to
location,
your
honor,
it
has
to
have
certain
navigation
lights.
these
are
all
application
of
specific
regulations.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
your
honor,
i
think
it
does
go
back
that...
that
this
is
actual
exercise
of
authority
by
the
coast
guard.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
your
honor,
we
think
the
working
conditions...
i
believe
justice
souter
mentioned
it...
is
clearly
the
working
conditions
on
the
barge
itself.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
regulate...
the
thousands
of
potential
working
conditions
that
could
be
regulated
cannot
be
addressed
in
minute
detail.
this
court
recognized
60
years
ago
in
southern
steamship--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--your
honor,
i
guess
we
haven't
discussed
is
the
relationship
of
master
to
seaman
is
entirely
different
from
that
of
employer
to
employee.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
they
have...
they
possess
statutory
authority
to
regulate
and
they
have
exercised
that
authority.
and
they've
emphasized
it
in
a
general
way,
maybe
not
in
the
same
exact
way
osha
does,
maybe
not
as
aggressively,
but
the
preemption
cases
from
this
court
say
that
once
there's
been
an
exercise
of
statutory
authority,
we
don't
look
at
the
quality
of
the
regulations,
we
don't
look
at
the
consistency
or
the
extent.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
if
you
work
on
a
semi-submersible
drilling
rig
and
you're
being
towed
at
night
and
having
the
presence
of
navigation
lights
is
to
protect
you
from
injury
from
a
colliding
vessel,
i
believe
that
does...
that
goes
to
health
and
safety
of
those
seamen
on
that
vessel.
i
think
it
clearly
does.
i
don't
think
you
can
take
very
specific,
you
know,
regulations...
the
working
environment
out...
out
at
sea
is
very
much
different
than
it
is
at
the,
you
know,
manufacturing
facility
in
new
jersey.
it's
two
different
kind
of...
two
different
types
of
animals.
and
that's
why
this
court
has
always
considered
seamen
to
be
wards
of
the
court.
that's
why
they
enacted
the
jones
act
for
their
protection,
the...
the
warranty
of
unseaworthiness.
seamen
have
been
treated
differently
for
as
long
as--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--it's
an
employer
of
seamen,
your
honor.
and
one...
one
thing
we
haven't
addressed
also,
your
honor,
i
think
the
fifth
circuit,
which
i
would
submit
is
the
preeminent
admiralty
circuit
court
at
least
in
this...
in
this
country,
has...
has
hit
the
nail
on
the
head.
adopting
the
definition
of
working
conditions
espoused
by
the
government
would
create
an
absolute
disastrous
and
unworkable
concept.
i
do
not
think
congress
in
its
wisdom
could
have
ever
intended
that
a
barge
within
3
miles
is
subject
to...
to
osha
jurisdiction.
as
it
leaves
the
3-mile
area,
now
it's
not
subject
to
osha
jurisdiction,
and
in...
within
3
miles
and
outside
3
miles,
it
is
still
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
coast
guard.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
mou
is
important.
in
this
case,
the...
the
osha
inspector...
it's
in
the
trial
transcript...
who
testified,
where
did
you
get
your
jurisdiction
in
this
case?
he
said,
i
looked
at
the
memorandum
of
understanding
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
i
had
jurisdiction.
the
fifth
circuit
is
correct.
14
u.s.c.
2,
the
enabling
statute
of
the
coast
guard,
says
it
covers
all
matters
not
delegated
by
law
specifically
to
some
of
the
federal
agencies.
two
federal
agencies
cannot
contravene--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
your
honor,
there's
no
confusion
in
the
fifth
circuit
because
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
clary
cases
and
the
donovan
cases
says
with
respect
to
the
working
conditions
of
seamen,
the
osh
act
doesn't
apply.
period.
the
confusion
is
in
the
ninth
circuit.
the
confusion
is
in
the
eleventh
circuit
when
you
have
osha
standards
being
applied
to
seamen.
and,
your
honor--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
yes,
1980.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
no.
the
fifth
circuit
had
handled
that,
your
honor,
and
said
it
was
a
special
purpose
drilling
barge
similar
to
the
mr.
belden.
and...
and
the
fifth
circuit
was
right.
it
didn't
matter
if
it
was
inspected
or
it
wasn't
inspected.
but,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
the
fifth
circuit
is
correct.
if
you
let
two
agencies
regulate
the
working
conditions
of
seamen
and
have
osha
come
in
with
a
nook
and
cranny
theory
and
fill
in
gaps
every
place
there's
not
a
coast
guard
regulation,
outside
of
the
fifth
circuit
of
the
united
states,
you
will
have
absolute
confusion.
you
will
have
redundancy.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
your
honor,
i
think
that
we
have
three
amicus
briefs
that
were
filed.
we
have
the
american
waterways
operators
and
two
other
entities
i
think
strongly
urging
this
court
to
adopt
the
position
we're
espousing
for
the
very
reason
that
they
anticipate
that,
yes,
that
there
will
be
confusion
if
there's
two
sets
of
regulations.
marine
operators
have
to
know
who
to
look
to--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
there
is...
there
has
been
confusion
on
this
issue.
i...
i
would
submit
to
you
that
where
the
osh
act
has...
has
supplanted
or
overreached
into
the
area
of
the
coast
guard,
there
has
been
confusion.
but
there
has
not
been
confusion
in
the
fifth
circuit,
where
we
have
the
mississippi
river
and
the
gulf
of
mexico,
because
marine
operators
know
what
the
law
is
and
they've
been
able
to
apply
that.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
huge
gap.
they...
as
i
had
mentioned
earlier--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--your
honor,
the...
the
coast
guard
has
the
absolute
authority,
statutory
authority,
to
board,
inspect,
investigate
any
vessel
they
choose
randomly
at
will,
whatever
they
want
to
do,
and
to
seize
that
vessel,
to
control
it--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--your
honor,
what...
i
go
back
to
what
i
said
earlier.
under
14
u.s.c.
2,
the
coast
guard
has
been
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
safety
and
life
at
sea.
if
they
are
not
doing
their
job,
if
they
need
to
have
more
regulations,
then
yes,
that
is
a
question
properly
addressed
to
the
congress,
not
to
this
court.
i
respectfully
submit
that.
then
they
have
to
go
to
congress
and
say,
we
need
more
regulations
in
this
area.
you
need
to
do
that.
under
the
marine--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
your
honor,
the
rule
of
deference
only
applies
if
the...
it
is
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
statute
is
unambiguous
in
its
intention.
i
believe
14--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
the
enabling
act
says,
covering
all
matters
not
specifically
delegated
by
law
to
some
other
federal
agencies.
it
was
enacted
in
1915.
there's
been
no
specific
delegation
by
law
to
osha,
and
osha
has
assumed
jurisdiction,
so
to
speak,
of
uninspected
barges
through
a
private
treaty,
informal
agreement
between
them
and
the
coast
guard.
that
is
improper.
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
federal
modalities
may
not
shift
and
exchange
responsibilities
between
themselves.
if
they
want
to
go
to
congress
and
they
want
to
carve
out
an
exemption
for
uninspected
vessels
in
state
territorial
waters,
they
can
do
that.
the
congress
can
enact
that,
and
i
have
no
complaints.
but
that
cannot
be
something
done
between
agencies
among
themselves,
your
honor.
and
this--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--your
honor,
i
can't
speak--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--i'm
not
an
antitrust
lawyer,
your
honor,
about
which
i
could...
i
could
speak
to
that.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
no.
your
honor,
if
i
could
go
back
to
what
justice
kennedy
had
said
earlier,
though,
about
the
kitchen
knives,
i
think
he's
absolutely
correct.
the
theory
espoused
by
the
government,
if
there
is
not
an
express
regulation
for
inspected
vessels,
inspected
vessels
being
900-foot
passenger
vessels,
your
honor,
if
there
is...
if
there
is
not
a
coast
guard
regulation
that...
that
specifically
addresses
kitchen
knives,
then
under
the
theory
espoused
by
the
government,
osha
can
absolutely
step
in
and
regulate--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--your
honor,
they've
just
chosen...
osha
has
chosen
not
to
regulate
inspected
vessels
pursuant
to
a
memorandum
of
understanding,
but
it
does
not...
it
doesn't
change
the
statutory
scheme
one
bit.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
you're
right,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
but,
your
honor,
the
statute
doesn't
say
comprehensive,
pervasive
exercise;
it
says
exercise.
and
i
think
we
give
its
plain
meaning.
and...
and
if
there's
been
an
exercise
of
authority
by
one
federal
agency,
i
think
it
will
create
confusion,
i
think
it
will
create
redundancy,
and
it
will
create
a
proliferation
of
regulations
that
are
not
needed.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
according
to
osha,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
but
we
say--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--if
there
were
no
express--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--if
there
was
just
the
mere
possession
of
authority
without
the
exercise,
i
would
argue,
your
honor,
that
they
still...
the
coast
guard
still
has
been
charged
with
their
responsibility
and
they
still
would
have
that
responsibility.
they
just
were
not
doing
their
job.
but
in
this
case,
they
have--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--yes,
your
honor--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
the
coast
guard
has
absolute,
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
uninspected
vessels.
they
have
the
statutory
authority
and
they
have
exercised
the
statutory
authority
through
regulations.
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
your
honor,
i'd
say...
i
would
agree
with
that.
i'd
say
that
even
if
they
had
the
possession
of
authority
given
to
them
by
congress
and
they
choose,
for
whatever
reason,
not
to
exercise
that,
then
the
complaint
is
still
not
properly
before
this
court.
it's
properly
with
congress
as
to
why
they're
not
doing
their
job
and
to
ensure
that
they
do
it
or
to
take
the
jurisdiction
away.
but
that's
not
our
case.
if
you
just
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor,
there
was...
there...
there
was
no
regulations
regarding
atmospheric
presence
of
natural
gas.
yet,
what
did
the
coast
guard
do?
they
immediately
dispatched
people
to
the
scene.
they
took
control
of
the
well.
they
prevented
pollution.
they
saved
lives.
they
did
a
6-month
investigation.
osha
did
nothing.
osha
came
out
to
the
site,
turned
around,
never...
never
interviewed
a...
a
crew
member,
never
stepped
foot
aboard
the
mr.
belden,
and
received
in
the
mail
a
certified
letter
with
respect
to
citations.
the
coast
guard
did
their
job
in
this
case,
even
though
there's
not
express
regulations
and
provisions
in
minute
detail,
and
they
continue
to
do
that
for
any...
any
marine
accident
or
any
serious
marine
accident
that
fits
the
criteria
of
deaths,
personal
injuries,
or
property
damage.
they
do
the
job.
there...
there
is
not
this
gap
in
coverage,
your
honor.
if
there's
a
death
on
a
vessel
in
navigable
waters
or
an
injury,
whether
it
be
an
uninspected
vessel
of
whatever
length
or...
or
something
larger,
the
coast
guard
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
to
investigate.
and
the
marine
safety
manual
says,
when
they
investigate,
one
of
the
other
things
they
must
do
is
to...
to
look
at
existing
regulations
to
determine
if
there
is
a
need
for
a
change
in
the
regulations,
to
supplement
the
regulations,
or
to
leave
them
as
they
are
because
they
have
the
expertise.
they've
been
doing
this
since
1915,
since
the
department
of
transportation
enabled
them
and
empowered
them
to
do
their
job.
they
have
the
special
expertise
in
this
area.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
patrick
j.
veters
--thank
you
very
much.
