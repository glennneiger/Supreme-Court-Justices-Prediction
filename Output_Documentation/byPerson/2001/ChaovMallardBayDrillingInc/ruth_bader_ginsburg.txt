mr.
roberts,
do
you
think
you
could
explain
to
us...
just
go
back
to
the
basics.
what
is
the
difference
between
an
inspected
vessel
and
an
uninspected--
and
also,
you
introduced
just
now
not
this
type
of
an
inspection.
so,
there
are
subcategories
within
an
inspection.
if
you
could
just
tell
us
what
fills
those
categories--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
some...
some
uninspected
are
more
closely
watched?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
one
know
that
this
is
a
little-inspected
vessel,
as...
as
distinguished
from
uninspected
but
more
inspected?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there's
a
difference
between
having
statutory
authority
and
discretion
to
exercise
it.
and
the
coast
guard
may
have
statutory
authority
which
it
chooses
not
to
exercise.
but
on...
to
the
extent
that
i
understand,
your
argument
is
if
the
coast
guard
has
authority
and
exercises
it
to
any
extent,
then
that's
preempted.
is
that...
do
i
understand
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
veters,
that
might
have
been
a
more
persuasive
argument
if
we
didn't
have
30
years
of
experience
with
this
understanding
between
the...
the
two
agencies.
so,
what
you
describe
as
unworkable
has
apparently
worked
for
some
30
years
and
it's
open
and
notorious.
congress
hasn't
stepped
in
to
say,
agencies,
you've
got
it
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
now
addressing
a
different
question,
whether
there's
any
statutory
authority
for
this
arrangement.
you're
not
addressing
the
question
i
asked
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
this
massive
confusion
if
for
30
years
this
has
been
in
place
and
at
least
the
agencies
are
telling
us
that...
that
it's
working
okay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
said...
i
thought
you
said
that
it
confused
it.
you
could
not
have
these
two
agencies...
that
there
would
be
pandemonium
out
there
by
the
people
who
are
regulated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
government
is
telling
us
that's
not
so.
it's
been
that
way
for
30
years,
and
even
the
clary
case
is
what?
1980?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government
said,
well,
as
they
read
it,
that
just
goes
to...
it
wasn't
clear
that
it
wasn't
an
inspected
vessel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you've
had
it
for
30
years
outside
the
fifth
circuit,
and
there
hasn't
apparently
been
this
massive
confusion.
is
the
government
dissembling
when
it
tells
us
that
there
hasn't
been
such
confusion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
should
it
be
anticipate
since
this
has
been
going
on
so
long?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
if
the
coast
guard
didn't
regulate
the
toilets,
then
osha
could
regulate
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
you?
i
mean,
you...
you
have
said
if
they
exercise
any
authority,
that's
it.
it's
totally
preemptive
of
what
the
regulate
and
what
they
don't
regulate.
suppose
they
don't
exercise
any
authority
at
all.
would
this
be
just
a
no
regulation
plan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
coast
guard
didn't
regulate
anything
on
this
particular
class
of
uninspected
vessels,
then
would
there
be
authority
in
the
occupational
safety
and
health--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
don't...
you
don't
put
anything...
i
misunderstood
your
argument
before.
i
thought
you
said
if
they
exercise
any
authority,
then
everything
is
preempted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
if
they
didn't
choose
to
exercise
any
authority,
that
osha
could...
could
regulate.
but
now
you're
saying
there
is
no
authority
at
all
with
respect
to
these
uninspected
vessels
in
any
agency
other
than
the
coast
guard.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
