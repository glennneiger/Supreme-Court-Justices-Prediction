how
much
of
a
dispute
would
survive
the
solicitor
general's
review
of
the
two
agencies'
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
regulations
just
have
to
be
an
exact...
if
the
regulation
is
not
an
exact
duplicate
of
what
osha
would
do,
it
isn't
covered?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
if
you
regulate
smoke...
if
the
coast
guard
regulates
smoke
because
of
some
reasons
but
doesn't
address
the
particulates
in
the
smoke,
osha
could
come
in
and
have
a
regulation
for
smoke
coming
out
of
the
vessel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--coast
guard
regulations
said
that
we're
going
to
regulate
this
aspect
of
smoke.
insofar
as
particulates
are
concerned,
we
think
seamen
are...
can
take
particulates.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
veters,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where...
where
will
we
find
it
in
the
papers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
let's
take
a...
perhaps
a
practical
example
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
supposing
all
the
coast
guard
had
regulated
here
was
marine
toilets:
don't
dump
your
toilets
into
the
navigable
water.
would
you
say
that
osha
could
not
do
anything
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
are
the...
the
kinds
of
examples
that
perhaps
focus
your
attention.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
client
isn't
a
seaman.
it's
an
employer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
veters.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts,
you
have
11
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
don't...
you
don't
rely
on
the
memorandum
as
any
independent
basis
for
a
ruling--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
no.
00-927,
chao,
secretary
of
labor
versus
mallard
bay
drilling
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
