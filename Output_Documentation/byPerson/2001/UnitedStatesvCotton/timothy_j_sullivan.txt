mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
the
issue
with
jurisdictional
is
twofold
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
that
it
a
case
that's
old
somehow
loses
its
forth
e-
force
after
apprendi.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
and
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
the
apprendi
court
and
the
majority
is
restricting
now
is
is
that
that
exact
function
of
the
court.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
justice
scalia,
the
burden
is
upon
the
government
in
their
prosecution
to
indict
the
appropriate
offense.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
much
like
neder,
justice
kennedy,
this
case
is
the
product
of
a
laboratory
test
tube.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
justice
scalia,
let
me
as
a
trial
attorney,
let
me
just...
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
[ns]
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
perhaps
i...
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
right.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
sure
there
are
attorneys
who
did
that.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
so,
i
don't
think
that
i'm
sure
that
there's
attorneys
throughout
the
country
who
were
making
these
types
of
objections,
sensing
the
change
from
mcmillan
and
almandarez-torres,
sensing
the
direction
of
this
court,
but
we
we
did
not.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
justice
breyer,
my
my
answer
is
that
it
all
goes
back
to
the
indictment
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
to
the
jurisdictional
end-run
that
justice
souter
was
alluding
to.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
justice
breyer,
mechanik
and
nova
scotia
were
not
jurisdiction-
were
not
constitutional
rules.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
i
think
it
goes
back
to
the
historical
function
of
the
the
grand
jury,
justice
scalia,
and
the
fact
that
what
happens
to
the...
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
the
petty
jury
is
an
advers-
is
the
product
of
an
adversarial
process
where
a
judge
acts
as
a
referee
and
the
law
is
well
defined
and
the
evidence
is
well
known.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
a
defendant
can
certainly
waive
a
grand
jury
and
proceed
by
information.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
i
don't
mean
waive
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
and
following
up
on
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
agree
that
the
evidence
in
this
case,
despite
mr.
dreeben's
articulation,
was
that
overwhelming.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
w-
w-
i
i
i
we-
i
can't
argue
with
that.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
[inaudible]
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
a
detectable
amount
when
you
when
you're
charged
with
a
detectable
amount,
it
doesn't
behoove
you,
as
a
as
a
as
an
attorney,
to
challenge
a
detectable
amount.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
and
and
the
problem
is,
justice
ginsburg,
that
under
apprendi
judge
blake
she
was
the
wrong
judge
applying
the
wrong
standard
of
proof.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
the
government
cannot
i
take
the
position,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
jus-
that
the
government
cannot
reindict
on
double
jeopardy
grounds.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
and
i
find
that
fantastic
because
it's
usually
the
other
way
around...
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
s-
the
rule
of
law
i
mean,
sometimes
you
you
roll
the
dice
and
sometimes
the
defense
wins
and
oftentimes
the
government
wins,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
judge
blake
instructed
the
jury,
the
petit
jury,
that
drug
quantity
was
not
a
concern
of
the
court
i
mean,
a
con-
concern
of
the
jury.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
i
think
in
pre-apprendi
practice,
no.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
justice
ginsburg,
i
had
the
olano
test
is
quite
clear
that
you
don't
l-
well,
that
a
decision
on
a
basic
right
that
is
forfeited
doesn't
matter
on
if
somebody
is
innocent
or
guilty.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
i
think
this
is
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
no.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
i'm
sorry.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
justice
breyer,
in
this
multi-defendant
eight
forty-six
conspiracy,
the
defense
was
one
part
that
the
government
cooperators
lacked
credibility,
that
they
weren't
reliable.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
it
was
that
and
there
was
also
multiple
conspiracies.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
i
i
don't
think
that
that
that
that
that
would've
been
you
never
use
drug
quantities
as
a
defense.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
i
don't
think
it
can
be
harmless,
justice
breyer,
because
the
very
thrust
of
neder,
the
very
thrust
of
harmless
error
analysis
is
that
the
government
must
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
error
didn't
affect
substantial
rights.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
tha-
i-
i-
i
think
you're
obviously
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
and
my
point
is
,
justice
breyer,
is
that
i
agree
with
the
premise
of
your
question.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
i
i
i
don't
believe
that
mechanik
was
wrongly
decided,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
that's
correct,
but
there
was
never
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
indictment
the
indictment
itself
in
mechanik,
which
is
the
root
of
our
contention
here.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
justice
souter,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
we
try
to
remain
as
true
as
we
can
to
the
framers'
intent
and
the
framers'
fear
of
a
corrupt
judiciary
or
an
o-
an
oppressive
prosecutor.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
i
i
i
yo-
y-
you're
right
in
that
regard,
justice
souter,
but
we
don't
know
if
the
government
did
its
duty
and
presented
to
this
grand
jury
drug
quantities
in
the
superseding
indictments.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
and
i
and
i
i
guess
it
goes
back,
justice
souter,
to
where
i
began
this
morning.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
the
dilemma
is,
i-
justice
souter
is
that
what
this
would
crack
open
the
gate
to
allow,
i
would
suggest,
the
government
to
trample
into
the
the
grand
jury
function.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
that
--
no.
mr.
timothy
j.
sullivan
that's
correct,
but
it's
also
correct
that
i
told
the
chief
justice
earlier
that
that
the
that
the
problem
is
a
sentencing
problem
in
this
case
and
not
a
difference
between
what
is
the
differ-
my
time
is
up.
