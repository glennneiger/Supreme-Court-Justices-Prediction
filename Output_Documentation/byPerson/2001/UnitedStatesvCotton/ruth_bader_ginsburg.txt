justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
dreeben,
you
would
like
us
to
make
that
clear,
wouldn't
you,
because
it
isn't
in
our
cases
so
far,
that
that
kind
of
error,
whatever
it
is,
doesn't
qualify
as,
quote,
jurisdictional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
there
are
many
instances
where
the
court
has
said
that
an
error
is
that
that
a
requirement,
certain
requirement,
is
mandatory
and
jurisdictional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
dreeben,
seems
to
me
a
substantial
difference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
case?
if
if
the
standard
were
harmless
error
rather
than
plain
error,
w-
would
you
maintain
that
the
government
should
still
prevail?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
court
could
well
conclude
otherwise
were
the
test
harmless
error
and
you
could
still
prevail.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
some
defense
attorneys
make
the
objection
for
the
record
in
any
case?
i'm
thinking
back
in
the
old
days
when
there
was
jury
discrimination
and
the
courts
routun-
routinely
-tinely
said
no,
but
many
defense
attorneys,
knowing
they
were
going
to
lose
on
it,
made
it
for
the
record
anyway,
hoping
that
their
case
on
appeal
would
be
the
one
that
changed
the
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
before
the
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
that
some
people
might
differ
about
this
particular
case
and
maybe
this
time
it's
roll
of
the
dice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
case,
in
in
a
case
where
the
the
law
was
was
in
flux,
this
would
not
be
a
determination
a
plain
error
determination
wouldn't
be
that
routinely
this
kind
of
omission
could
occur.
