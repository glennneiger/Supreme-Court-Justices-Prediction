mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
typical
of
many
federal
drug
prosecutions
that
were
tried
before
this
court's
decision
in
apprendi
versus
new
jersey.
respondents
were
indicted
on
a
superseding
indictment
that
alleged
a
conspiracy
to
distribute
cocaine
and
cocaine
base
without
alleging
a
specific
threshold
quantity
of
drugs
that
were
involved
in
the
offense.
respondents
were
convicted
of
that
offense
at
trial,
and
the
evidence
established
at
trial
that
the
offense
involved
well
in
excess
of
fifty
grams
of
cocaine
base,
the
threshold
quantity
of
drugs
to
authorize
a
minimum
sentence
of
ten
years
and
a
maximum
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
at
sentencing,
as
all
parties
expected,
the
judge
made
findings
of
drug
quantity
and
determined
that
the
quantities
of
drugs
involved
in
the
offense
justified
a
sentencing
range
up
to
life
imprisonment
and
imposed
sentences
on
several
respondents
of
life
imprisonment
and
others
of
thirty
years'
imprisonment.
respondents
made
no
objection
to
the
judge's
procedure
in
determining
drug
quantity
himself
without
a
jury
trial
determination
on
that
issue
or...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
without
an
allegation...
well
at
at...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
problem
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
the
omission
of
a
drug
quantity
allegation
from
the
indictment
is
a
jurisdictional
error
that
always
requires
automatic
correction
on
plain
error
review
regardless
of
the
strength
of
the
evidence
against
respondents
on
the
question
or
on
whether
respondents
had
notice
that
they
would
ha-
face
an
increased
sentence
as
a
result
of
enhanced
quantities
of...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
will
happen
if
the
this
court
affirms
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
respondents
will
not
be
subject
to
the
sentences
that
congress
authorized
and
that
the
evidence
unequivocally
showed
in
this
case
were
justified.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
this
case
we're
not
arguing
about
retroactivity.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
case
was
tried...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
absolutely,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
o'connor,
this
court
already
has
overruled
ex
parte
bain
on
its
square
holding,
which
is
that
the
narrowing
of
an
indictment
is
impermissible
and
deprives
the
court
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that
that
is
a
difference
from
ex
parte
bain,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
m-
jurisdictional
has
been
appended
as
a
label
to
a
variety
of
kinds
of
errors,
but
the
relevant
sense
in
which
it's
being
invoked
in
this
case
and
in
which
the
lower
court
understood
it
was
a
kind
of
defect
that
may
be
raised
at
any
time
regardless
of
an
objection
and
that
is
tantamount
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
sort
of
error
that
is
so
fundamental
to
the
proceedings
that
harmless
error
review
and
plain
error
review
simply
don't
apply.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
in
the...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
this
case,
justice
stevens,
we
rely
most
fundamentally
on
the
fact
that
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
of
respondents'
indictment
was
that
all
defendants
understood
that
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
a...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
don't
have
to
rely
on
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
not
in
view
of
the
fact
that
at
the
l-
prevailing
legal
regime
at
the
time...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
i
would.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
didn't
withdraw
all
references
to
quantity,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
ear-
earlier
indictment
in
terms
said
this
offense
involves
more
than
fifty
grams
of
cocaine
base.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
i
don't
think
it
would
mean
n-
nothing,
justice
stevens,
but
we
are
asking
the
court
to
rule
on
the
broader
ground
that
when
an
indictment
fails
to
allege
what
we
now
understand
to
be
an
element
of
the
offense,
but
the
evidence
is
sufficiently
powerful
so
that
any
rational
grand
jury,
if
asked,
would
have
found
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
nothing,
just-
chief
justice
rehnquist,
because
stirone
was
a
case
in
which
two
features
are
present
that
are
not
present
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
a
little
unclear,
justice
kennedy,
whether
the
defendant
can
do
that
because
typically
the
government
has
not
acquiesced
and
the
courts
have
not
been
hospitable
to
partial
pleas
of
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
can't
do
it
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy,
which
is
why,
in
effect,
the
result
that
the
court
of
appeals
achieved
is
a
tremendous
windfall
for
the
defendants.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
the
objection
could
take
place
at
trial
when
a
defendant
could
have
said
the
government
has
to
prove
this
quantity
up
to
the
jury
or
it...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
was
just
what
i
was
about
to
say,
justice
souter.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
objection
would
not
be
irrelevant
because
for
two
different
reasons.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
a-
any
a
substantive
drug
count
is
a
separate
offense
from
a
conspiracy
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
disparity
in
sentencing
is
large
both
from
the
government's
point
of
view
and
from
the
defendant's
point
of
view.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i-
in
that
kind
of
case,
our
position
would
be
the
same,
that
particularly
on
plain
error
review,
the
court
should
look
to
the...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
right,
even...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i-
it's
not
clear
that
that
neder
wouldn't
apply
to
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
it's
not
the
position
that
we're
taking,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there
there
is
a
class
of
cases
in
which
the
court
will
find
an
effect
on
substantial
rights
without
regard
to
the
strength
of
the...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
those
cases
are
called
structural
error
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that's
all
the
court
needs
to
hold
in
order
to
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
this
case
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
got
to
the
fourth
step
of
plain
error
review,
after
finding
an
effect
on
substantial
rights,
and
then
it
held
that
we
really
can't
say
what
the
grand
jury
would
have
done.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i-
i-
if
that
case
took
place,
as
this
one
did,
in
a
legal
regime
in
which
the
government
didn't
believe
it
had
to
get
a
grand
jury
indictment
on
the
point,
then
i
suppose
my
answer
to
that
is
if
we
had
known,
we
could
have
gone
back
to
the
grand
jury
and
gotten...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
we
could
have
gotten
a
superseding...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
and
that's
what's
odd
about
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
true,
but
the
defendant
on
this
case
proceeded
on
the
same
theory
as
we
did.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
y-
you
could
make
that
argument,
justice
souter,
but
in
a
post
imb-
apprendi
environment,
apprendi
is
a
sufficiently
well-known
decision
of
this
court
that
no
prosecutor
would
responsibly
go
to
sentencing
and
say
i
would
like
to
have
an
increased
sentence
regardless
of
the
fact
that
we
didn't
charge
drug
quantity.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
we
would
because
of
reasoning
analogous
to
the
court
used
in
neder
versus
united
states.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
the
government
waives
rebuttal.
