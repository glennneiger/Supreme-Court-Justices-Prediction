that's
i
i
ta-
i'll
take
that
as
given.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right
but
we've
faced
many,
many
cases
in
which
the
normal
tendency
of
the
courts
has
been
to
say,
forget
about
errors
at
the
grand
jury
stage.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
defense?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
was
the
defense
at
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
was
it
basically
they
didn't
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wonder
on
the
harmless
part
or
whether
it's
harmful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
that
that
you
see
the
reason...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
i
say
that
is
because
they're
saying,
look,
this
error
is
harmless,
and
part
of
the
strength
of
your
claim
i
think
is
that
they
never
could've
thought
of
it
at
the
trial
before
apprendi
to
raise
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
trying
to
a-
direct
your
attention
to,
which
is
and
and
maybe
this
doesn't
help
you.
