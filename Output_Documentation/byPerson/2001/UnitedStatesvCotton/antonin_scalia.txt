i
i'm
i'm
not
sure
i
i
y-
you
you
say
we
should
determine
whether
substantial
rights
has
have
been
affected
by
by
asking
whether
if
the
procedure
that
has
been
omitted
had
not
been
omitted,
he
would
have
been
conv-
he
would
have
been
convicted
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
point
is
it
seems
to
me
the
way
you
decide
whether
substantial
rights
have
been
affected
is
not
to
ask
the
question
would
he
b-
would
he
have
been
convicted
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
step
that
you
that
you
should
put
your
your
emphasis
on
in
this
case,
not
not
the
not
the
substantial
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
that's
all,
but
i
mean,
that's
that's
pretty
big.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
justice
antonin
scalia
imagine
aprendi?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
apprendi
was
was
based
on,
i
assume,
the
long
common
law
tradition.
justice
antonin
scalia
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
sullivan,
i
have
the
same
problem
that
justice
breyer
has.
justice
antonin
scalia
function
of
the
jur-
of
the
of
the
petty
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
had
every
incentive
to
do
that
before,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
what
apprendi
was
all
about,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
the
the
lack
of
conformity
between
the
indictment
and
the
conviction
is
not
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
be
indicted
for
one
offense
and
convicted
of
another.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
you
you
don't
agree
that
the
verdict
corresponded
to
the
indictment,
do
you?
i
i
thought
the
only
reason
that
that
issue
was
not
in
this
case
is
because
of
neder.
