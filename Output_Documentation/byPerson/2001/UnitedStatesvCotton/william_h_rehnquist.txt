[inaudible]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
here,
the
the
verdict
of
the
jury
corresponded
to
the
indictment,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
government
can
surely
also
argue
that
ex
parte
bain
by
its
terms
doesn't
apply...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
case
because
the
indictment
and
the
verdict
corresponded.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
can
be
an
error
but
not
a
matter
of
not
going
to
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
because
there
was
no
right
of
direct
appeal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
what
does
the
what
does
the
government's
position
do
to
the
stirone
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
my
point
was
that
bain
involved
a
situation
where
the
verdict
and
the
indictment
didn't
correspond,
and
that
a
rule
that
says
that's
jurisdictional
might
not
extend
to
this
situation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
re
bonner
was
one
of
those
old
habeas
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
but
i
i
think
you
have
to
recognize
that
the
court
at
that
time,
because
there
was
no
direct
appeal,
w-
kind
of
expanded
the
concept
of
jurisdiction
to
reach
constitutional
errors.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
dissenters
couldn't
imagine
it,
either.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
waive
a
grand
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
mean
when
you
say
waives
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
idea
that
you
can
waive
a
grand
jury
s-
sus-
suggests
that
perhaps
it
is
no
certainly
no
higher
than
the
the
petty
jury
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
butt
i-
it
was
an
issue
before
the
ju-
the
judge
before,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
neder,
didn't
the
court
assume
that
substantial
rights
were
affected?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you're
right
in
that,
then
mechanik
was
wrongly
decided.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i-
i-
it
it's
said
that,
you
know,
y-
y-
you
can't
attack
the
indictment
rendered
by
the
grand
jury
even
though
you
might
have
some
some
reason
to
do
so.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
ahead
david.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
the
verdict
corresponded
to
the
indictment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
one
is
no.
01-687
united
states
against
cotton.
respondents
led
a
vast
drug
conspiracy
in
baltimore.
a
federal
grand
jury
indicted
them
charging
them
with
conspiracy
to
possess
and
to
possess
with
intent
to
distribute
crack
cocaine.
the
indictments
did
not
specify
the
amount
of
crack
cocaine
involved
in
the
conspiracy.
the
jury
found
respondents
guilty
of
the
crime
charged.
consistent
with
the
practice
in
federal
courts
at
the
time,
the
district
court
made
a
finding
of
drug
quantity
at
sentencing.
the
court
found
one
respondent
responsible
for
at
least
500
grams
of
cocaine;
other
respondent
was
responsible
for
at
least
1.5
kilograms
of
crack
cocaine.
for
crimes
involving
50
grams
or
more
of
crack
cocaine,
congress
authorized
a
penalty
of
up
to
life
imprisonment.
accordingly,
the
district
court
sentenced
two
of
the
respondents
to
30
years
imprisonment
and
the
remaining
respondents
to
life.
without
a
finding
of
drug
quantity,
the
maximum
punishment
is
20
years
imprisonment.
respondents
did
not
object
in
the
district
court
to
the
fact
that
they
were
sentenced
based
on
a
finding
of
drug
quantity
not
alleged
in
the
indictment.
while
respondent's
appeal
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
we
decided
apprendi
versus
new
jersey
in
the
spring
of
2000.
under
apprendi,
any
fact
that
increases
the
penalty
for
a
crime
beyond
the
prescribed
statutory
maximum
must
be
submitted
to
a
petty
jury,
and
in
federal
prosecutions
must
be
alleged
in
the
indictment.
respondents
then
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
their
sentence
was
error
under
apprendi.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
respondents
did
not
raise
this
argument
in
the
district
court
but
nonetheless,
vacated
respondents’
sentences
on
the
ground
that
the
omission
of
drug
quantity
from
the
indictment
was
a
jurisdictional
error.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
the
notion
that
this
type
of
error
is
jurisdictional
is
derived
from
our
1887
decision
in
ex
parte
bain
which
stated
that
a
defective
indictment
deprives
a
trial
court
of
jurisdiction.
bain,
however,
was
decided
in
an
error
in
which
the
court’s
authority
to
review
criminal
convictions
was
greatly
circumscribed.
direct
review
of
criminal
convictions
in
this
court
was
not
available
and
the
court
could
grant
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
only
to
correct
jurisdictional
errors.
the
court
does
stretch
the
concept
of
jurisdiction
so
that
it
could
correct
obvious
constitutional
errors.
our
later
cases
however,
have
rejected
the
idea
that
indictment
defects
affect
the
court’s
power
to
hear
a
case.
to
remove
any
doubt
today,
we
overrule
bain
in
so
far
as
it
held
that
a
defective
indictment
deprives
the
court
of
jurisdiction.
we
thus
apply
ordinary
plain
error
analysis
to
respondents’
claim
since
it
was
not
raised
in
the
trial
court.
federal
courts
will
recognize
an
error,
not
raised
in
the
district
court
only
if
the
error
affects
the
fairness,
integrity,
and
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
respondents
do
not
satisfy
this
standard.
the
fairness,
integrity,
and
public
reputation
of
the
judicial
system
depends
on
meeting
out
to
those
inflicting
the
greatest
harm
on
society
the
most
severe
punishments.
the
real
threat
then
to
the
fairness,
integrity,
and
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings
would
be
of
respondents
despite
the
overwhelming
and
uncontroverted
evidence
that
they
were
involved
in
a
vast
drug
conspiracy
were
to
receive
a
sentence
prescribed
for
those
committing
less
substantial
offenses
because
of
an
error
that
was
never
objected
to
in
the
trial
court.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
decision
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
