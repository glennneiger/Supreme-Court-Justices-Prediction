justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
sentencing
,
is
it
it's
it's
really
not
that
much
of
a
burden
to
just
send
it
back
to
the
judge
and
tell
him
to
do
it
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
but
in
order
to
test
that,
i'm
i'm
just
asking
why
i-
it's
not
as
if
we
have
to
have
a
new
trial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
happens
is
there's
a
new
sentencing
hearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
this
th-
are
we
really
just
arguing
about
retroactivity
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me,
post-apprendi
in
the
trial
courts,
can
the
defendant
agree
with
the
government
to
plead
guilty
but
leave
it
to
the
judge
to
determine
the
amounts
of
the
drug
involved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
does
the
government
do
when
it
indicts?
there's
there's
no
stipulation
of
any
kind.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
guess
part
of
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
if
we
say
that
defendants
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
a
change
in
the
law
before
their
conviction
becomes
final,
there's
not
much
you
can
do
because
you'd
have
to
issue
a
superseding
indictment
and
you
can't
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
they'd
object.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
cannot
reindict,
but
the
objection
would
be
irrelevant
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mean
you
could
have
just
hit
him
with
another
hit
the
defendants
with
another
indictment
in
another
case
is
no
without
a...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
jeopardy
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
except
that
the
defendant
doesn't
have
to
proceed
on
any
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
i
think
he
might
concede
that
your
you're
both
equally
at
at
fault,
but
that
but
that
doesn't
get
you
all
the
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
but
if
we
s-
said
we
want
to
send
this
back
so
that
you
can
have
the
advantage
of
apprendi,
there's
nothing
the
government
can
do
because
it
can't
reindict.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
i
understand...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a-
a-
as-
assume,
as
the
courts
of
appeals
uniformly
seemed
to
have
held,
that
apprendi
is
not
retroactive
to
convictions
that
are
final.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
un-
under
the
first
indictment,
would
the
jury
have
been
instructed
that
it
had
to
find
the
amounts?
