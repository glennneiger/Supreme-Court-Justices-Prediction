justice
john
paul
stevens
you
rely
on
for
the
notice
proposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
run
of
cases
or
the
fact
there
was
a
preceding
indictment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ot
really
relying
on
the
fact
that
in
a
prior
indictment
it
was
withdrawn
and
superseded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
time
they
filed
the
prior
indictment,
but
when
they
withdraw
it
and
file
a
se-
se-
second
indictment,
you
normally
would
think
they've
withdrawn
the
charges
that
have
been
withdrawn.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
separate
point,
and
i
understand
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
withdrew
the
quantity
allegation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
thought
we
were
taking
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
indictment
did
not
charge
enough
to
get
the
sentences
l0
that
they
received.
justice
john
paul
stevens
earlier
indictment
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
interrupt
you
by
saying
i
think
it
would
be
most
unfortunate
if
we
decided
this
case
on
the
particular
fact
that
there
was
an
original
indictment
and
not
and
a
superseding
indictment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
a
practical
matter,
is
between
life
and
sent-
life
sentence
and
twenty
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah...
justice
john
paul
stevens
dreeben,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
i
understand
it's
not
this
case,
but
would
the
govern-
what
what
would
the
government's
position
be
if
the
evidence
of
quantity
came
out
after
the
trial
was
concluded
just
as
a
result
of
a
pre-sentence
investigation
and
then
a
finding
by
the
judge?
what
would
what
should
happen
in
that
kind
of
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
though
the
evidence
was
not
before
the
jury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
neder
wouldn't
apply
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
take
the
same
position
even
if
all
the
evidence
developed
post-trial
during
the
pre-sentence
investigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
go
ahead...
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
just
give
you
sort
of
an
intermediate
hypothetical?
supposing
all
the
evidence
of
quantity
developed
after
the
grand
jury
had
returned
its
indictment
that
it
developed,
that
in
the
plea
bargaining
they
found
out
how
much
dru-
there
really
was
involved,
you'd
treat
that
as
the
same
case
even
though
the
gan-
grand
jury
could
not
have
indicted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
didn't
know
the
evidence
at
the
time
is
what
i'm
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
y-
you
the
fact
that
one
defendant
was
acquitted
i'm
not
sure
is
is
relevant.
