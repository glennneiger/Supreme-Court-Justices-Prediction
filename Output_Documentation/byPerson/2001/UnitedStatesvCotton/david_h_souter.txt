justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean
the
the
point
at
which
the
the
the
the
failure
to
indict
and
allege
on
quantity
becomes
objectionable
is
at
sentencing.
justice
david
h.
souter
no
reason
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
if
we
see
it
your
way,
it
would
be
open
to
prosecutors
all
the
time
simply
to
make
the
grand
jury
proceeding
a
short-cut
and
not
bother
to
get
into
quantity
and,
hence,
not,
in
in
effect,
ad-
advise
the
or
the
the
the
the
grand
jury
that
it's
that
it's
going
for
something
that
might
have
the
the
potential
for
life.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
your
argument
th-
that
you
made
a
second
ago
that
we
never
know
what
the
grand
jury
would've
done
if
it
had
been
presented
with
the
evidence?
the
difficulty
that
i
have
with
that
argument
is,
number
one,
i
think
we
have
a
pretty
clear
body
of
law
that
tells
the
grand
jury
what
its
duty
is,
if
it
is
presented
with
evidence
which
would
justify
an
indictment
with
respect
to
quantity
and
hence
the
severity
of
the
crime.
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't
wasn't
that
a
fear,
in
effect,
that
grand
juries
are
simply
going
to
be
puppets
that
are
going
to
be
indicting
without
regard
to
evidence?
whereas,
here
the
assumption
is
the
evidence
is
overwhelming,
and
so
that
policy
of
wanting
the
grand
jury
to
stand
between
the
state
and
the
individual
is
not
really
a
policy
that's
implicated
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
tend
not
to
nullify,
i
think,
except
when
there
are
political
considerations
that
the
grand
jury
sort
of
smells
in
the
circumstances.
justice
david
h.
souter
think
you've
i
think
you
got
a
good
argument
there
except
for
the
fact
that
we've
got
to
find
a
distinction
between
the
role
of
the
grand
juries
and
the
petty
juries
given
the
fact
that
neder
is
is
on
the
record.
