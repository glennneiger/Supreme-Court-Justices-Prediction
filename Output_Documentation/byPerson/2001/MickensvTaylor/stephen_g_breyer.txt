justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
u.s....
in
the
public
defender's
office,
couldn't
this
situation
arise
fairly
frequently?
sometimes
in
a
small
office,
somebody
in
the
office
would
have
represented
a
victim
many
years
before
on
a
totally
different
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
if
it
arises
fairly
often,
then
what
kind
of
a
rule
would
you
suggest?
i
mean,
does
it
mean
that
they
have
to...
public
defenders
have
a
hard
time.
i
mean,
they...
they
can't...
you
know,
they...
they
can't
have
a
thousand
people
in
their
office,
and
sure
enough,
some
members
of
the
people...
sometimes
this
will
happen.
so,
what
kind
of
rule
would
you
suggest?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
was
asking
you
what
the
rule
should
be,
not
the
rule...
i
probably
wasn't
specific
enough.
i
can't
necessarily
reconcile
all
the
cases.
so,
if
we
were
starting
from
scratch
and
you
had
a
lawyer
in
a...
in
a
public
defender's
office
who
many
years
before
had
represented
a
victim,
what
should
the
rule
be
about
whether
he
can
represent
this
person
before
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
forget
whether
the
court
knows
or
doesn't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
what
the
rule
should
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
doesn't
help
me.
if
the
facts
are
that
many
years
before
the
person
represented
the
victim
on
a
different
matter.
now,
what
kind
of
a
standard
is
the
judge
supposed
to
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
i
got
it.
that's
helpful.
then
why
not
just
say,
and
that's
what
you
have
to
do
here?
the
judge
should
look
into
whether
or
not
your
client
was
significantly
harmed
in
the
way
you
just
said
because
his
lawyer
couldn't
do
a
proper
job
given
the
preceding
representation.
why
isn't
that
just...
that
would
take
care
of
all
these
cases
just
as
you
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
so,
now
he
didn't
do
it.
why
not
just
send
it
back
and
tell
him,
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
say
where
there's
that
prejudice,
you
lose;
if
there
isn't
that
prejudice,
you
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
if
you're
right
then
on
this
point,
then
there
was
loads
of
prejudice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
then
in
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
use...
send
it
back?
i
thought
they
found
no
prejudice.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
trouble
i'm
having
with
the
standard
is
not
whether
the
judge
happens
to
know
he
should
have
looked
in
or
shouldn't
have
looked
into
it,
which
were
unusual
circumstances.
if
a
lawyer
is
under
a
real
conflict...
a
real
one,
a
very
serious
one,
a
terrible
one...
his
client
cannot
get
effective
assistance.
so,
i
would
have
thought
that's
the
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
the
client
get
effective
assistance
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
the
difficulty
comes
up
because
the
lawyer
doesn't
normally
tell
him,
just
like
any
other
ineffective
case,
and
now
the
judge
has
to
decide
what
is
and
what
is
not
ineffective
assistance.
so,
to
do
that
in
the
conflict
category,
do
we
just
look
to
the
aba
rules?
they're
often
quite
attenuated.
what
do
we
use
to
decide
whether
the
conflict
is
serious
enough
so
the
client
couldn't
get
effective
assistance?
once
he
didn't,
i
guess
you
do
presume
prejudice
because
you
can't
go
back
and
second
guess
every
second
of
what
the
lawyer
was
doing.
but
what's
the
standard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
is
that...
so,
that's...
it's
exactly
at
the
time
you
say
the
words
actual
conflict,
that
i
think
have
gotten
me
mixed
up
in
these
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
sometimes
they
mean
one
thing,
sometimes
another.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
maybe
not.
but
whether
there
is
or
not,
can
we
do
better
than
saying
actual
conflict?
should
we
say
actual
conflict
creating
ineffective
assistance?
should
we
say
look
at
the
aba
rules?
what
should
we
say
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
matter
how
severe
the
conflict.
i
mean,
no
matter
how...
in
your
view,
no
matter
how
severe
the
conflict,
still
unless
you
can
show
that
it
actually
affected
the
lawyer's
representation,
it
is
not
a
constitutional
error.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
strickland
doesn't
say
that.
strickland
says
that
it's
important
to
maintain
a
fairly
rigid
rule
of
presumed
prejudice
for
conflicts
of
interest.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
should
we
change
strickland?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
worst
case,
when
the
lawyer
says
nothing,
you
end
up
not
getting
rid
of
him...
i
mean,
or
not...
assuming
prejudice--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
in
the
case
where
he's
more
honest
about
it
and
comes
straightforward,
then
you're
going
to
presume
the
prejudice.
