mr.
wagner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't...
didn't
the
district
court
find
against
you
on
the...
on
the
point
of
whether
there
was
an
adverse
effect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether,
in
addition
to
a
sixth
amendment
violation,
you
have
to
show
an
adverse
effect.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
holloway
and
cuyler
were
both
multiple
representation
cases
where
the
trial
court
could
see
the
whole
thing
right
before
him
at
that
time.
this
was
not
a
multiple
representation
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
asking
for
a
special
rule
in
death
penalty
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
why
do
you...
why
do
you
stress
the
fact
this
a
death
penalty
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't...
wouldn't
that
be
true
in
most
criminal
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there...
is
there
anything
close
to
that
sort
of
a
showing
here,
that
this...
the
lawyer
was
trying
to
sabbotage
the
defense?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why...
why
do
you
make
that
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you're
saying
that
if...
if
a
person,
say,
has
a
team
of
six
lawyers,
if
there's
one
with
a
conflict
of
interest,
the
whole
case
has
to
be
tried
over.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
the...
this
is
the
second
time,
mr.
wagner,
you've
referred
to
an
attorney
being
there
to
sabbotage
the
defendant.
you
feel
that's
something
that
fairly
frequently
happens?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
you
would
be
very
careful
about
making
a
statement
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
did
you
make
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
it
a
compelling
point
if
it
hardly
ever
happens?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wagner.
mr.
harris,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
what
holloway
is
talking
about?
expected
prejudice
basically.
if
the
attorney
says
i
can't
represent
these
people,
instead
of
letting
it
go
ahead
and
prove
that
he's
right,
which
you
have
every
reason
to
think
he's
right,
you
simply
say,
we'll
have
to
stop
right
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank...
thank
you,
mr.
harris.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
wagner,
you
have
3
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wagner.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
00-9285
mickens
against
taylor
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
