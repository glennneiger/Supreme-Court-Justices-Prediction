justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
answer
to
justice
breyer...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
was
that
there
had
to
be
some,
at
least
strong
possibility
of
adverse
effect
in
the
instance
where
he
represented
the
victim
years
before.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
here
it
seems
to
me
that
two
inquiries
tend
to
become
conflated
in
a
case
like
this.
if
there's
no
adverse
effect,
that
shows
that
there
was
no
conflict.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
that's
quite
different
from
a
case
where
there's
multiple
representation
over
the
defendant's...
over
the
counsel's
objection.
i
mean,
we
could
say
that
in
that
line
of
cases,
prejudice
is
apparent
from
the
record.
it...
it...
a
burden
on
counsel
inheres
intrinsically
in
the
representation
to
which
he
objects.
but
that's
not...
there...
there
are
hundreds
of
different
kinds
of
conflicts.
the...
the
defense
attorney
is
a
candidate
for
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
an
upcoming
election.
one
attorney
has
been
interviewed...
the
defense
attorney
has
been
interviewed
for
a
position
in
the
da's
office
4
weeks
before.
all
of
these
things
you
say
there's
an
absolute
requirement
of
a
new
trial
without
any
inquiry
into
whether
there's
an
adverse
effect?
this
is
an
astounding
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
you
were
telling
us
you
don't
inquire
about
an
adverse
effect.
i
thought
that's
your
whole
point.
correct
me,
please,
if
i'm
wrong.
i
thought
you
were
arguing--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
thought
you
were
arguing
to
us
the
proposition
that
it
is
wrong
to
inquire
into
adverse
effect.
once
there
has
been
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court
to
inquire,
that's
the
end.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then...
so
then
your
argument
whether
there's
an
adverse
effect
is
completely
contrary
to
your
own
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
except
in
holloway
exactly
that
happened.
the...
the
lawyer
said,
judge,
i
can't
represent
these
three
defendants,
and
the
judge
said,
you
go
ahead
and
do
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
this
court
reversed.
i
read
the
opinion
as
saying
that
in
this
case
the
conflict
is
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
record.
the...
the
attorney
is...
is...
has
such
a
burden
that
it...
the
conflict
inheres
in
the
very
objection
the
attorney
makes.
you
don't
even
need
to
look
any
further.
that's
the
way
i
read
that
opinion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
going
back
to
the
earlier
questions
about
the
counsel's
ethical
duty,
as
you
understand
it,
quite
apart
from
the
constitution,
is
there
a
duty
of
loyalty
to
the
former
client
or
just
a
duty
of
maintaining
confidentiality?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we've
been
trying
to
find
a
way
to
distinguish
holloway
from
this
case.
one
way
is
to
say
that
multiple
representation
is
so
fraught
with
difficulties
that
it's
simply
a
separate
category.
another
is
to
say
that
the
likelihood
of
an
adverse
effect
is
so
significant,
so
serious
that
we'll
presume
it.
another
is
to
say
that
the
conflict
itself
is
much
more
serious
in
most
cases
than...
how
would
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--how
would...
how
would
you
have
us
deal
with
holloway?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
wood
stand
for
a
similar
proposition,
or
is
wood
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
wood
is
an
effect
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
victim
were
the
fiance
of
the
lawyer's
niece
and
the
lawyer
was
very
close
to
the
niece,
and
he
says,
i
can't
do
this,
judge.
i...
i
can't
represent
this
murderer.
