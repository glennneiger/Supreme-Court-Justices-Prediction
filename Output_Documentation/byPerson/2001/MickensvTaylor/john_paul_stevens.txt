justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if...
if
in
your
view
would
everything
have
been
satisfactory,
as
a
constitutional
law
matter,
if
the
judge
had
said,
go
ask
your
client
if
the
client
has
any
objection,
and
the
client
had
said,
no,
i
have
no
objection?
would
that
have
taken
care
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
counsel,
i'm
a
little
puzzled
at
this
point
too.
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
would
have
no
case
if
the
judge
were
not
on
notice
of
the
potential
conflict.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not...
you're
not
arguing
that
a
lawyer
could
have
this
relationship
and
keep
it
secret
for
5
years
and
then
come
around
and
say,
now
set
aside
the
conviction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
we're
taking
the
case
on
the
assumption
there's
been
a
hearing
and
there's
been
evidence
that
established
an
absence
of
adverse
effect.
at
least
i
thought
that's
the
way
the
case
comes
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
i
thought
the
key
to
your
case
was
the
fact
that
the
judge
had
a
duty,
when
advised
or
on
notice
of
a
potential
conflict
of
interest,
of
making
an
inquiry
as
to
find
out
whether
in
fact
there
was
such
a
conflict.
i
thought
that's
your
whole
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
look
at
the
question
presented--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
your
question
presented
by
your
blue
brief.
it's
potential
conflict.
that's
what
you
put
in
your
brief.
now
you're
changing
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
holloway
doesn't
stand
for
that
proposition,
does
it?
holloway
is
consistent
with
what
you
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
you
about
holloway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
holloway
is
good
law
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
didn't
require
any
showing
of
adverse
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
do
you
think
the
lawyer
in
this
case
had
a
duty
to
tell
his
client
that
he
had
represented
the
victim?
just
an
ethical...
not
a
constitutional
duty,
as
an
ethical
matter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
the
next
question
i
have
is
do
you
think...
again,
not
necessarily
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
but
that
it
would
have
been
good
practice
for
the
judge
to
inquire
of
the
lawyer
whether
he
thought
there
had
been
any...
any
difficulty
in
the
representation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
take
it
one
step
further
and
turn
away
from
the
ethics
to
the
constitution?
what...
what
would
you
say
about
a
case
of
the
same
facts,
but
the...
the
client
tells
the...
the
client
finds
out
about
it
and
asks
the
judge
to
relieve
the
lawyer
because
the
client
doesn't
want
a
lawyer
who
represented
the...
the
victim?
would
the
judge
have
a
constitutional
duty
to...
to
discharge
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i've
given
you
the
facts.
the...
the
client...
all
the
client
says
is,
i
don't
trust
a
lawyer
who's
represented
the
man
that
i'm
accused
of
killing.
i
would
like
a
different
lawyer.
would
the...
would
the
judge
have
a
duty
to
give
him
a
different
lawyer
as
a
constitutional
matter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
suggest
that
the...
the
problem
is
not
the
bright
line
distinction
between
potential
conflict
and
actual
conflict,
but
rather
the
serious...
the
potentially
serious
character
of
the
conflict.
and
your
point
is
that
the
lawyers
in
holloway
made
it
clear
to
the
judge
it
was
a
serious
problem.
whereas,
here
it's
not
all
that
apparent
because
it
may
have
been
just
a
routine
appointment
of
the
public
defender's
office
that
just
happens.
but
if
this
lawyer
had
been
the
family
attorney
for
the
victim
for
the
last
30
years
and
knew
them
intimately
and
so
forth,
i
think
you
would
agree
then
the
judge
had
a
greater
duty
of
inquiry
than
he
might
have
had
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
more
likely
to
be
prejudicial
would
be
the
point.
if
it's
reasonably
likely
to
the
judge
to
know...
i
mean,
if
it's
reasonably
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
matter,
whether
said
by
the
lawyer
or
just
from
the
facts,
that
there's
a
real
danger
of
prejudice
here,
you
would
agree
the
judge
has
a
duty
of
inquiry,
i
would
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
interrupt
you
here,
though.
the
prejudice
standard
under...
under
strickland
is
not
the
standard
we're
talking
about
here,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
push
that
all
the
way.
supposing
in...
in
holloway
itself
the
judge
said,
well,
i...
i
really
think
you...
he
thought
it
through
and
said,
i
think
you
could
represent
both.
could
he
have
just
gone
ahead
and
insisted
on
the
lawyer
representing
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
here
is
when
does
the
judge
have
a
duty
of
inquiry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
he
never
has
a
duty
of
inquiry
unless
there's
going
to
be
actual
prejudice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
supposing
there's
a
clear
possibility
of
prejudice,
but
no
actual
proof
of
prejudice,
is
that
enough
to
impose
a
duty
of...
of
inquiry
on
the
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you're
saying
in
this
case
if
the
lawyer
had
said
to
the
judge,
my
client
doesn't
trust
me
because
i...
i
represented
the
decedent
and
he
won't
be
candid
with
me,
then
the
judge
would
have
had
a
duty
to
discharge
counsel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
that
case
have
been
different
from
holloway?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
it's
because
my
client
doesn't
trust
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
irony
of
the
rule
is
that
it
gives
greater
protection
when
the
lawyer
is...
conceals...
unethically
conceals
a
known
conflict
than
when
he's
candid
with
the
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
argument...
that's
the
argument
here,
that
in
order
to
get
the
higher
rate
of...
of
fees
for
representing
a
defendant
in
a
capital
case,
he
didn't
want
it
to
be
known
that...
that
he
represented...
you
know,
had
this
prior--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand
that.
