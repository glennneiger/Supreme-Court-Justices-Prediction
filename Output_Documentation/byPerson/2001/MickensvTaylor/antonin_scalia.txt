justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you're...
you're
presuming
a
conflict.
i...
i
really
don't
follow
your
argument
for
that...
whether
the
judge
had
an
obligation
to
inquire
into
a
conflict
about
which
he
knew
or
should
have
known.
what
he
should
have
known
was...
was
not
the
existence
of
a
conflict,
but
simply
that
this
defendant...
that
the
deceased
had
previously
been
represented
by
counsel
who's
representing
this
defendant.
that
does
not
constitute
a
conflict.
the...
what
follows
from
that...
from
that
relationship?
does
anything
follow
other
than
the
fact
that
the
lawyer
cannot,
in...
in
a
subsequent
representation,
disclose
any
confidential
information
which
he
learned
in
the
prior
representation.
right?
isn't
that
the
only
thing
that
follows?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine,
but
that
doesn't
show
a
conflict.
that
shows
at
most
the
potential
of
a
conflict,
and...
and
you're
representing
it
here
as
though
there
is
a
conflict
and...
and
the
judge
had
an
obligation
to
inquire
into
it.
but
the
whole
issue
is...
is
whether
there
was
a
conflict.
that
hasn't
been
established
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what?
why
does
that
constitute
a
conflict?
unless
you
connect
up
that
confidential
information
which
he
knew
with
something
that
was
relevant
to
the
defense
of
his
new
client,
there's
no
conflict.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
no
longer
a
secret.
how
can
you
keep
a
secret
that
is
no
longer
secret?
justice
antonin
scalia
require
somebody
to
keep
a
secret
that
is
something
that
is
no
longer
a
secret?
i
don't
think
that's
what
they
require.
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
can
pursue
it
from
the
newspaper.
he
doesn't
have
to
pursue
it
from
his
confidential
knowledge.
he
can
pursue
it
from...
from
the
newspaper.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that...
is
that
your...
see,
i
don't...
you...
you
haven't
put
it
that
way.
you...
you've
put
it
that
if
the
judge
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
conflict.
now,
is
that
it?
which
is
it?
you've
said
this
morning
if
he
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
conflict.
is
that
he
should
have
known
of
the
conflict
or
should
have
known
of
the
potential
conflict?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i'm...
i'm
asking
you
what
your
position
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
--no.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but...
a
very
different
question.
you
mean
whenever
there's
a
potential
conflict,
if
the...
if
defense
counsel
had...
had
represented
the
victim
20
years
ago
on
a
totally
unrelated
matter,
there...
there's
always
some
confidential
information
he
might
have
obtained.
the
judge
always
has
to
inquire
into
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
potential
does
potential
have
to
be
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
that
may
be
conflicting.
justice
antonin
scalia
20
years
ago.
is
that
enough
of
a
peril?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
knew
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
if
the
lawyer
says
that?
i
don't
feel
comfortable
representing
this...
this
defendant
because...
because
i
represented
the
decedent
that
he's
accused
of
murdering.
the
same
question
as...
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--justice
stevens,
only
it's...
it's
counsel
who--
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
what
confuses
me
about
this
discussion.
i'm...
i'm
not...
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
we're
equating
the
existence
of
an
actual
conflict
with
prejudice.
is
that
what
you're
saying,
that...
that
when
you
show
an
actual
conflict,
there
is
automatically
prejudice?
i...
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understood
it
to
be
the
law
that
no
matter
how
actual
and
apparent
the
conflict
is,
if
it
had
not
effect
on
the
trial,
there's
no
foul.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
how
do
you
explain
holloway?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that...
all--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
all
you
can
say
for
sure
in
holloway
was
that
there
was
an
actual
conflict.
there
was
no
showing
of
what
effect
that
conflict
had
upon
the
representation.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
conflict
is
so
obvious
or
the
prejudice
is
so
obvious?
justice
antonin
scalia
--but...
but
the
world
changes.
i...
i
assume
that
trial
judges
generally
do
what
we
say
they're
supposed
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
it
may
mean
it
may
well
be
that
if
they
don't,
nothing
happens
afterwards,
but
usually
they'll
do
what
we
suggest.
won't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
a
virginia
jury
convicted
petitioner
of
the
premeditated
murder
of
timothy
hall
during
or
following
the
commission
of
an
attempted
forcible
sodomy,
and
sentenced
petitioner
to
death.
petitioner
filed
a
federal
habeas
petition
alleging
that
he
was
denied
effective
assistance
of
counsel
because
one
of
his
court
appointed
attorneys
had
a
conflict
of
interest
at
trial.
petitioner's
lead
attorney,
bryan
saunders,
had
been
representing
the
victim
on
assault
and
concealed
weapon
charges
at
the
time
of
the
murder.
the
same
juvenile
court
judge
who
dismissed
the
charges
against
the
victim
because
of
his
death
later
appointed
saunders
to
represent
petitioner.
saunders
did
not
disclose
to
the
court,
to
co-counsel
or
to
petitioner
that
he
had
previously
represented
the
victim.
the
district
court
denied
habeas
relief
and
an
en
banc
majority
of
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
affirm.
the
defendant
seeking
to
set
aside
the
conviction
because
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
generally
must
demonstrate
a
reasonable
probability
that
but
for
counsel’s
errors
the
conviction
would
not
have
occurred.
there
is
an
exception
to
this
general
rule.
we
have
spared
the
defendant
the
need
of
showing
probable
effect
upon
the
outcome
and
have
simply
presumed
such
effect
where
assistance
of
counsel
has
been
denied
entirely
or
during
the
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding.
when
that
has
occurred
the
likelihood
that
the
verdict
is
unreliable
is
so
high
that
case
by
case
inquiry
is
unnecessary,
but
only
in
what
our
opinion
called
“circumstances
of
that
magnitude”
do
we
forgo
individual
inquiry
into
whether
counsel’s
inadequate
performance
undermine
the
reliability
of
the
verdict.
we
have
held
in
several
cases
the
circumstances
of
that
magnitude
may
also
arise
when
the
defendant’s
attorney
actively
represented
conflicting
interests.
the
question
before
us
in
this
case
is
whether
the
principle
established
in
those
cases
provides
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
under
the
circumstances
here.
in
holloway
versus
arkansas
the
court
created
and
automatic
reversal
rule
where
counsel
is
forced
to
represent
to
co-defendants
over
his
timely
objection
unless
the
trial
court
has
determined
that
there
is
no
conflict.
if
the
court
does
not
inquire,
we
said
an
automatic
reversing.
in
cuyler
versus
sullivan,
we
declined
to
extend
holloway
and
held
that
absent
objection,
where
counsel
does
not
object,
a
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
automatic
reversal
by
reasonable
conflict
of
interest,
though
he
is
excused
we
said
from
demonstrating
that
the
outcome
of
the
case
would
probably
have
been
different
but
for
the
conflict,
he
is
not
excused
from
the
obligation
of
the
showing
that
the
conflict
actually
affected
the
adequacy
of
his
representation.
and
finally
in
wood
versus
georgia
we
had
granted
certiorari
to
consider
an
equal
protection
violation
but
it
came
to
our
attention
that
counsel
may
have
been
actively
representing
the
conflicting
interest
of
the
defendants
and
their
employer.
this
possibility
was
sufficiently
apparent
at
the
time
of
the
trial
court
proceeding
to
impose
upon
the
trial
court
a
duty
to
inquire
further.
we
therefore
remanded
for
the
trial
court
to
conduct
the
inquiry
it
had
omitted,
directing
the
trial
court
to
grant
a
new
hearing
if
it
determine
that
“an
actual
conflict
of
interest
existed",
that
is
a
sort
of
a
crucial
language
in
that
case.
petitioner
argues
that
the
remand
instruction
in
wood
established
an
unambiguous
reversal
rule
that
where
the
trial
judge
neglects
a
duty
to
inquire
into
a
potential
conflict,
a
defendant
need
only
show
that
his
lawyer
was
subject
to
a
conflict
of
interest,
that
he
not
only
did
not
show
that
the
effect
of
the
conflict
upon
counsel’s
performance
probably
produce
the
conviction,
but
that
he
need
not
even
show
that
the
conflict
had
any
adverse
effect
upon
counsel’s
performance,
we
reject
this
proposal
rule.
as
used
in
the
remanded
structure
in
wood,
the
phrase
“an
actual
conflict
of
interest"
meant
precisely
a
conflict
that
affected
counsel’s
performance
as
opposed
to
a
mere
theoretical
division
of
loyalties.
it
was
shorthand
for
the
statement
in
cuyler
versus
sullivan
that
“a
defendant
who
shows
that
a
conflict
of
interest
actually
affected
the
adequacy
of
his
representation
need
not
to
demonstrate
prejudice
in
order
to
obtain
relief",
that
if
he
did
not
demonstrate
that
the
outcome
would
probably
have
been
different.
petitioners
propose
rule
of
automatically
reverse
would
make
little
policy
sense.
the
trial
court’s
awareness
of
a
potential
conflict
does
not
make
it
anymore
likely
that
counsel’s
performance
was
significantly
affected
nor
does
it
in
any
other
way
rendered
a
verdict
unreliable.
nor
is
automatic
reversal,
we
conclude
an
appropriate
means
of
enforcing
a
trial
judge’s
duty
to
inquire.
to
void
the
conviction
in
the
present
case
therefore
it
was
necessary
for
petitioner
to
establish
that
the
conflict
of
interest
adversely
affected
his
counsel’s
performance.
the
fourth
circuit
having
found
no
such
effect,
the
denial
of
habeas
relief
must
be
affirmed.
on
cuyler,
this
case
was
presented
and
argued
on
the
assumption
that
absence
some
exception
for
failure
to
inquire,
the
sullivan
standard
would
be
applicable
to
a
conflict
rooted
in
counsel’s
obligations
to
former
clients.
we
do
not
rule
upon
the
correctness
of
that
assumption.
