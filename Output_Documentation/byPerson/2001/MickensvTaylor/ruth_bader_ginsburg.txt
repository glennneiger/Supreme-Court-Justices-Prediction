but,
mr.
wagner,
what
difference
should
it
make
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
defendant
whether
the
judge
knew
or
the
judge
didn't
know?
you
make
a
sharp
distinction
between
this
case
where
the
judge
knew.
but
suppose
mickens
didn't
know
and
the
judge
didn't
know.
why
should
mickens
be
worse
off?
in
both
cases
he
doesn't
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you...
would
you
say
what
they
were?
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
of
the
things
you
listed
were
just
matters
of
record
and
not
at
all...
there
was
one
conversation
between
this
lawyer
and
the
client.
we
know
it
took
place
for
15
to
30
minutes,
and
that
was
it.
and
a
number
of
your
recitations
do
involve
matters
of
public
record
that
would
not
involve
betraying
any
client
confidence
if
saunders
brought
them
out.
so,
what
was
it
that
saunders
knew
that
was
not
available
to
the
public?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
wagner,
may
i
stop
you
there?
because
it
seems
to
me,
reading
the
wood
v.
georgia
case
and
those
facts,
in
those...
in
that
case
the
actual
conflict
and
the
adverse
effect
coincided.
if
the
lawyer
were
loyal
to
the
employer
and
the
employer
was
interested
in
setting
up
a
test
case,
then
that
very
conflict
would,
at
one
and
the
same
time,
establish
the
adverse
effect.
therefore,
i
could
not
take
from
the
wood
case
what
you
are
urging
this
court
to
take.
and
if
that's
so,
then
the
wood
case
is
in
no
different
category.
it's
a
case
where
adverse
effect
has
been
claimed
and
the
two
are
not
distinguishable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if,
on
the
facts
of
that
case,
those
two
are
opposite
sides
of
the
same
coin...
there's
no...
if
you
show
one,
then
you
inevitably
show
the
other...
then
how
can
we
extract
the
words
of
the
decision
from
the
fact
background
against
which
justice
powell
was
writing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
are
making
a
nice
statement
in
the
abstract.
i'm
trying
to
bring
it
down
to
earth
in
the
wood
case,
and
i
said,
well...
you
answered
both
questions
if
the
employer
has
a
conflict...
if
the
lawyer
has
a
conflict
because
the
employer's
interest
diverges
from
the
employee's.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
court
found
nothing
because
it
raised
this
question
on
its
own.
it
was
never
briefed
and
argued.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
we
said
you
find
out
about
this,
lower
court.
we
were
supposed
to
hear
another
question
entirely.
we
found
that
there
is
this
lurking
issue
that
should
be
decided
first.
there
was
no
briefing.
how
can
you
use
that
as
establishing
a
whole
new
category,
a
case
like
that
where
the...
the
court
didn't
even
have
the
benefit
of
briefing
on
the
issue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
say
it
was
unethical
for
the
lawyer
not
to
have
revealed
to
the
court
and
his
client
not
what
is
the
better
practice,
but
that
it
was,
in
fact,
a
violation
of
the
ethical
constraints
for
the
lawyer,
knowing
that
he
had
represented
the
victim,
not
to
tell
his
client
so
his
client
could
make
the
choice
whether
to
keep
the
lawyer
or
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
i
wasn't...
i
wasn't
asking
you
any
question
about
the
constitution.
i
was
asking
you
about
the
ethical
canons
that
govern
lawyers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
lawyer
have
a
duty
to
advise
the
client
of
a
potential
conflict?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
does
it...
from
the
defendant's
vantage
point,
why
should
it
make
a
difference?
he's
got
a
counsel
who
has
betrayed
his
obligation.
he
doesn't
know
anything.
the
client
doesn't
know
anything.
why
is
mickens,
who
has
a
lawyer
who
doesn't
tell
the
court...
why
is...
would
he
be
better
off
if
the...
the
judge
knew
or
should
have
known
than
when
nobody
knows
and
he's
totally
in
the
dark?
from
the
defendant's
point
of
view,
the
judge's
knowledge
isn't
significant.
it's
that
he
has
a
lawyer
who
is
not
totally
able
to
represent
him
with
undivided
loyalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
is...
what
is
the
test
for
determining
whether
there
was
an
impairment?
you're
not
saying
you
have
to
be
able
to
show
that
the
defendant
might
have
been
acquitted--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--or
might
not
have
gotten
the
death
penalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
what
is...
what
is
the
nature
of
the
impairment?
