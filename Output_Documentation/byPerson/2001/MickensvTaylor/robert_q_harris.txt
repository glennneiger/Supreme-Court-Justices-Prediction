mr.
robert
q.
harris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fourth
circuit
correctly
required
a
showing
of
adverse
effect
for
mickens
to
establish
a
conflict
of
interest
claim.
there
is
a
rule.
the
court
has
established
a
rule
and
the
general
application
for
deciding
conflict
of
interest
claims,
and
it
was
decided
in
sullivan.
it's
consistent
with
the
repeated
admonition
of
this
court,
that
in
order
to
claim
an
interference
with
the
right
to
counsel,
you
have
to
show
that
it
had
some
effect
on
the
representation.
sullivan
states
the
sixth
amendment
standard.
justice
breyer,
the
rule
that
you're
looking
for
is
in
sullivan.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
well,
sullivan
explicitly--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
sullivan
explicitly
carves
out
holloway.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
holloway
is...
is
not
been
overruled.
it
is
perfectly
good
law.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
what
the
court
said
in
holloway
is
that
relying
on
the
representations
of
counsel
that
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
and
that
he
would
be
unable
to
examine
his
multiple
clients,
the
failure
to
inquire
into
that
was
itself
error.
and
i
think
if
you...
you
can
put
holloway
into
the
exact
same
terms
of
the
sullivan
over-arching
standard.
the
fact
that
counsel
has
taken
these
steps
of
advising
the
court
that
he
sees
a
conflict
of
interest,
the
fact
that
counsel
tells
the
court,
when
they
get
to
trial,
that
he
is
not
able
to
examine
his
several
clients
because
of
the
confidences
he
knows,
that
is,
as...
as
holloway
said,
relying
on
counsel
being
in
the
best
position
to
know.
that
is
persuasive
evidence
that,
in
fact,
the
conflict
existed.
and
obviously,
the
impact
on
the
representation
in
that
circumstance
is
evident.
the...
the--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--the
district
court
found
that
he
should
have...
under
the
rules
of
ethics,
he
should
have
advised
his
client
of
the
fact
that
he
had
previously
represented
tim
hall.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i...
i
certainly
agree
that
it
would
have
been
good
practice
both
for
defense
counsel
and
for
trial...
the
trial...
well,
in
this
case
it
wasn't
a
trial
court.
it
was
a
juvenile
court
that...
that
made
the
appointment.
certainly
it
would
be
a
good
practice.
i
think
that
is
part
and
parcel
of
what
sullivan
was
saying
when
it
is
encouraging
trial
courts
to
make
those
inquiries
even
on
facts
that
may
not
be
based
on
the
objection
of
counsel
or
the
defendant.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
cannot
make
the
final
call
on
whether
it
was
ethical
or
not.
we
have
an
independent
body
in
virginia
that
is...
is
there
to
do
that
very
thing,
the
virginia
state
bar.
i
would
agree,
as
the
district
court
said,
that
the
obligations,
the
ethical
obligations,
of
counsel
would
be
to
provide
disclosure
of
such
information
to
his...
to
his
client.
the...
it
is
the
next
step
that
you
are,
i
guess,
deliberately
not
taking
that...
that
i
would
have
to
say
that
that
is
not
the
type
of
conflicting
interest
that
would...
that
was
being
addressed
in
the
sullivan
standard
for
finding
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--there
is
a
general
duty
of
counsel
to
advise
his
client
of
any
circumstances
which
the
client
would
want
to
know,
as
far
as
matters
that
may
affect
the
loyalty
of
counsel
to
client.
that
is
the
general
and
accepted
ethical
statement.
certainly
that
is
an
obligation
that
was
mr.
saunders'
obligation
at
the
time
of
this
case.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
well,
the...
i
think
holloway
i
think
doesn't
make
a
distinction
between
the
defendant
himself
or
his
client.
so,
in
that
very
circumstance,
the
judge
would
have
a
duty
to
inquire.
that
much
i
think
is
clear
from
holloway.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
no.
i
would
say
this,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
wheat,
the
judge
certainly
has
the
discretion,
a
very
broad
discretion
at
that
point
in
time,
to
anticipate
the
possibility
of
conflicts
and
to
substitute
counsel
on
the
risk,
on
the
possible
danger
of
a
conflict
appearing
later
on.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
understand.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
and
the
answer
is...
is
essentially
the
same
as
well.
if
counsel
is
representing
to
the...
if
that
can
be
interpreted
as
representing
to
the
court
that
he
is
objecting
to
representing
this
man
because
of
his
prior
representation,
the
court
has
to
inquire.
now,
of
course,
the
duty
that
sullivan
and
holloway
set
out,
as
far
as
the
duty
to
inquire,
is
not
a
duty
to
grant
relief.
it's
a
duty
to
inquire
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
risk
that
the
sixth
amendment
rights
will
be
jeopardized.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
well,
that's--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i
think
that
is
exactly
what
holloway
gets
to.
the
point
is
when
counsel
makes
the
effort
of
telling
the
judge
that
he
sees
a
conflict
of
interest
and
that
he
cannot
do
his
job
effectively,
that
essentially
makes
out
the
sixth
amendment
violation.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
after
the
close
of
the
representation
of
a
former
client,
i...
i
believe
that
the
general
duty
of
loyalty
devolves
down
to
that
duty
of
maintaining
the
confidences
of
your
former
client.
that
is
how
the
duty
of
loyalty
is
represented.
i...
i
don't
think
we
can
impose
a...
even
an
ethical
obligation
on
counsel
to
continue
to
have
good
feelings
about
a
former
client
or...
or
this
general
notion
of
having
once
represented
an
individual,
he
is
forever
subject
to
the
attorney's
care.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
believe
that
is--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i
believe
it
is.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
well,
again,
sullivan
addresses
the
very
concern.
it
indicates
that
counsel
must
be
actively
representing
conflicting
interests
before
we
have
a
presumed
prejudice.
he
must
have
an
actual
conflict
adversely
affecting--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
of
course--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
i
don't
think
there's
any
inconsistency
in
this
court's
cases
on--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
i
would
take
us
back
to
sullivan
because
what
sullivan
was
doing
was
identifying
what
the
lower
courts
had
already
been
doing
prior
to
the
time
of
its
decision,
which
was
finding
something
called
an
actual
conflict.
and
what
that
involved
was
identifying
diverging
interests,
inconsistent
interests,
essentially
potentially
conflicting
interests,
and
then
looking
to
see
whether
or
not
that
existence
of
diverging
interests
actually
had
any
effect
on
the
representation.
now,
the
lower
court
decisions
often
spoke--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--no,
and
that's
not
what
i'm
arguing.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
would
argue
that
it
is
the
adverse
effect
that
makes
a
potential
conflict
actual.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
holloway
i
think
can
easily
be
explained
as
the...
the
adverse
effect
and
actual
impairment
of
defense
counsel's
ability
to
conduct
the
representation--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--was
provided
by
his
own
statement.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
again,
what
sullivan
said
about
holloway
was
that
holloway
did
not
find
an
actual
conflict.
so,
i
will
stop
short
as
well.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
well,
perhaps--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i
substantially
agree
with
that,
with
the
following
caveat.
i
don't
think
that
holloway
necessarily
is
saying
the
actual
conflict
as
a
separate
concept,
actual
conflict.
it's
so
evident
that
we
will
presume
prejudice.
i
think
they
are
saying
that
in
those
particular
circumstances
where
the
matter
is
objected
to
and
brought
to
the
trial
court's
attention,
both
the
actual
conflict
and
the
expected
prejudice
from
the
attorney
telling
the
judge
he
cannot
represent
all
of
the
people
are
so
obvious
that--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
we
are
giving
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
trial
counsel's
ability
to
know
because
he
is
the
only
person
that
has
the
access
to
the
confidences
of
multiple
clients
who
will
know
for
certain,
or
at
least
with
a
high
degree
of
certainty,
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
conflict
and
that
it
will
affect
the
representations
of
the
various
clients.
but
to...
if
i
could
get
back
to
your
question,
there
is
a
difference,
i
think,
in
the
circumstance
where
the
attorney
has
made
that
representation
to
the
trial
court,
which
i
think
is
the
same
as
saying
i
see
an
actual
conflict
that
will
affect
my
representation.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
no.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
think
it
is...
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
trial
judge's
notice
of
facts
that
would
cause
him
to...
to
perceive
a...
the
language
that
the
court
used
was
a
particular
conflict.
but
the
notice
of
that
certainly
imposes
an
obligation
upon
him
to
inquire
into
it.
but
i
don't
think
you
can
then
say
that
having
knowledge
of
facts
that
would
suggest
an
actual
conflict
or
even
suggest
a
particular
conflict
can
be
equated
with
the
attorney's
representation
that
it
exists.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
well,
that
is--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--it
is
not
so
much
my
rule.
it
is
this
court's
rule.
that's
what
sullivan
said.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
as
far
as
ultimately
finding--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--that...
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
well,
it...
it
is
true
that
the
state
judges
and
federal
judges...
lower
federal
judges
all
are
sworn
to
uphold
the
same
constitution.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
would
say
to
the
extent
that
you
make
the
two
relationships,
the
between
representations
more
connected...
and
you
can
certainly
do
that
by
virtue
of
a
personal
relationship...
you
inch
your
way
along--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i...
i
certainly
agree
that
the
judge's
duty
of
inquiry
is...
is
presented
at
a
much
lesser
level
than
actual
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
and
it's
obvious
these
things
should
be
taken
care
of--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--no,
and
for
a
very
simple
reason.
you
do
not
have
the
one
ingredient
that
you
have
in
holloway
v.
arkansas.
you
do
not
have
the
representation
of
counsel,
the
person
in
the
best
position
to
know,
that
in
fact
he
sees
a
conflict
and
he
sees
the
impairment.
in
fact,
you
have
the
opposite.
the
fact
that
counsel
has
not
raised
any
matter
to
the
trial
court
when
he
is
in
the
best
position
to
know
and
when
he
does
not
see
that
there
is
a
conflict
sufficient
enough
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
over...
for
an
objection
to
be
resolved,
we
have
a
different
record.
in
that
case--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--again,
that
is
included
within
the
notion
that
we
have
one
sixth
amendment
standard
for
conflicts
of
interest
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
was
on
notice
of
some
facts
that
could
have
prompted
the
inquiry,
that
we
will
go
beyond
that
standard
in
the
circumstances
such
as
holloway
where
the
attorney
himself
has
made
it
an
essential
fact
of
the
case
that
he
has
identified
a
conflict
and
impairment
in
his
case.
the
difference
is
not
so
much
that
the...
i
mean,
i
guess
the...
the
answer
is
the
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
a
different
or
more
lenient
standard
of
review
of
his
conflict
claim,
you
know,
because
of
the
judge's
failure
to
act
on
notice
of
additional
facts.
it
doesn't
get
us
any
closer
to
determining
whether
or
not
there
actually
was
an
infringement
of
his
sixth
amendment
rights.
to
assume
it
on
the
basis
of
a
judge's
failure
to
act
on
notice,
it
simply--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--no.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
no.
the--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
the
court
is
using
the
adverse
effect
to...
as
a...
as
a
lesser
showing
of
prejudice.
as
an
example,
it
is
not
so
much
that
a
defendant
would
have
to
show
strickland
prejudice,
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
different
outcome,
but
he
certainly
has
to
show
the
likelihood
that
trial
counsel's
conduct
or
assessment
of
different
defenses
in
the
case
was
affected,
not--
