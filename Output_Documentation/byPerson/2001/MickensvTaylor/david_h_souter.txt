justice
david
h.
souter
well,
this
may
not
get
us
very
far
so
far
as
a
general
rule
is
concerned,
but
isn't
your
argument,
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned,
pretty
much
undercut
by
the
fact,
number
one...
let's
take
an
example.
let's
take
the
issue
that
you...
you
rightly
stress
about
the
response
to
the
victim
impact
evidence,
the...
the
mother's
testimony.
isn't
your
case
pretty
much
undercut
here
by
the
fact
that
the
information,
on
the
basis
of
which
defense
counsel
could
have
responded
to
the
mother's
testimony,
had
already
been
published
in
a
newspaper?
and
isn't
it
also
undercut
by
the
fact
that
there
was
co-counsel
here
and
there
is
no
claim
that
co-counsel
had
any
conflict,
actual
or
potential.
so,
if
we...
even
if
we
accept
your...
your
premise
that
proof
of
conflict
would
be
enough
in
this
situation,
don't
you
lose
anyway?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
no
confidence--
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
but
i...
i
don't--
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
i
find
that...
i
find
that
hard
to
accept,
but
i'll
accept
it
for
the
sake
of
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
gets
us
to
co-counsel.
justice
david
h.
souter
co-counsel
wasn't
bound
by
that
because
co-counsel
hadn't
represented
the
victim.
justice
david
h.
souter
one
apple
spoils
the
whole
barrel?
i
mean,
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
mean,
one
bad
apple
spoils
the
whole
barrel?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
in
any
case
at
this
point
you're
not
claiming
the
benefit
of
the
holloway
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
as
i...
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought
if...
if
you
had
the
benefit
of
the
holloway
rule,
you
wouldn't
have
to
show
even
an
actual
conflict.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you...
are
you
arguing
that
we
should
adopt
that
rule?
i
mean,
if
we
did,
that
would...
that
would
answer
the
point
that
has
just
been
raised.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
you
started...
at
least,
as
i
recall
back
in
your
brief,
you
started
out
by
arguing
that
what
puts
the
court
on
notice
doesn't
matter
so
long
as
the
court
is
on
notice.
you
said
in
holloway
counsel
raised
it
before
the
court,
and
you're
saying
in
this
case,
under
the...
at
least
the
rule
that
the
court
should
have
known
of
the...
of
the
potential
conflict,
that
was
the
functional
equivalent
to
counsel's
raising
it
in
holloway,
and
therefore
the
result
should
be
the
same.
as
i
understand
holloway,
if
the
result
were
to
be
the
same,
we
would
not
even
look
any
further
into
the
question
of
actual
conflict.
we
would
say
if
there
was
enough
to
put
the
court
on
notice,
reverse.
and
i
take
it
you're
not
arguing
for
that
now,
or
are
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
you're...
you're...
maybe
i...
i
misunderstood
your
position
when
i
was
running
through
the
briefs,
but
you're
not
taking
the
position
that
holloway's
counsel's
advice
to
the
court
should
be
equated
with
the
court's
kind
of
obligation
under
the
should
have
known
standard
that
you
argue
for
here.
you're
not
equating
those
two.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
in
your
original
argument
you
were
saying,
look,
in
holloway
defense
counsel
said,
there's
a
problem,
judge.
here
the
judge
knew
or
should
have
known
about
the
problem.
those
two
facts
are
equivalent,
and
i
take
it
now
you're
not
saying
those
two
facts
are
equivalent.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
was
no
finding
in
the
sense
that
the
court
made
a
formal
finding.
i
think
what
justice
scalia
was...
in
any
case,
what
i've
been
assuming
is
what
justice
kennedy
said
a
moment
ago,
that
when
counsel
in
a
multiple
representation
situation
says,
judge,
i
can't
go
on
representing
all
of
these
people,
that
the
conflict
is
so
obvious
that
we'll
take
it
as
a
given.
and...
and
i'm...
i'm
inclined
to
read
holloway
that
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
conflict
is...
is
so
obvious
because
it
seems
to
me...
and
this
was
going
to
get
to
my
next...
my...
my
question
to
you.
isn't
the
difference...
reading
holloway
the
way
i
am
reading
it,
isn't
the
difference
between
holloway
and...
and
sullivan
something
like
this?
we
realize
that
if,
through
no
fault
of
anybody,
through
the...
the
client
was
not
asleep,
the
judge
was
not
asleep...
it
nonetheless
turns
out
later
that
there
was
a
conflict,
we
want
to
make
sure
that
that
conflict
actually
had
an
effect
on
representation
before
we...
we
start
reversing
convictions.
but
if
there
was
reason
to
believe
in
advance,
if
somebody
told
the
judge
like
the
lawyer
in
holloway,
that
there
is
a
problem
here,
we
want
to
have
an
inducement
on
the
trial
court
to
pursue
that
problem
right
then
and
there.
and
in
order
to
get
that
inducement,
we're
going
to
have
a
rule
that
says,
you
don't
have
to
prove
effect.
all
you
have
to
prove
is
conflict.
in
other
words,
in
order
to
induce
the
trial
courts
to
be
on
their
toes,
the
defendants
later
on
have
a
lesser
burden.
do
you
think
that's
the
way
to
read
holloway
and
sullivan
together?
and
do
you
think
that
is
a
sensible
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
want...
you
know,
i
realize
that,
but
if...
if
we
want
to
keep
the
trial
judges
on
their
toes...
and
having
been
a
trial
judge,
i
can
tell
you
that
inducements
do
matter...
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
treat
the...
the
knowledge
that
the
appointing
judge
has,
in
a
case
like
this,
as
being
the
equivalent
of
the...
of
the
objection
by
counsel?
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
not
equate
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
the
trouble...
the
trouble
is
if
you
follow...
i
mean,
i
think
i
follow
your...
your
argument.
but
if
i...
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
then
nothing
is
really
added
to
the
law
by
saying
the
trial
judge
has
an
obligation
to
inquire
into
it
because
when
we...
when
we
come
at
the...
at
the
question
after
the
fact,
the
trial
judge
hasn't
inquired,
there's
been
a
trial,
there's
been
a
conviction,
then
the
issue
of
conflict
gets
litigated.
justice
david
h.
souter
on
your...
on
your
rule
we
proceed
under
the
same
standards
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
should
have
known.
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
regardless
of
who
it
belongs
to,
on
the...
on
the
argument
that
you
are
making,
the...
the
standards
are
exactly
the
same
whether
the
judge
should
have
known
or
should...
need
not
necessarily--
justice
david
h.
souter
it
didn't
seem
to
happen
here,
though,
did
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
does
that...
does
that
duty
of
inquiry
have
any
consequence
later
in
the
standards
by
which
the
case
will
be
judged
on,
say,
collateral
attack?
