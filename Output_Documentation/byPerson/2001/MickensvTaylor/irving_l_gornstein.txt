mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
district
court
has
reason
to
know
about
a
potential
conflict
and
fails
to
initiate
inquiry,
the
sixth
amendment
is
violated
only
when
there
is
a
showing
of
an
actual
conflict
and
an
adverse
effect
on
the
quality
of
performance.
and
we
say
that
for
three
reasons.
first,
it
is
a
central
tenet
of
this
court's
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence
that
a
sixth
amendment
violation
does
not
occur
unless
there
has
been
prejudice
to
the
defense.
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
that
basic
principle
to
set
aside
a
jury
verdict
and
order
a
new
trial
with
all
the
societal
costs
that
entails
when--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
is
not.
under
sullivan,
there
has
to
be
an
adverse
effect
on
the
quality
of
performance,
but
it
is
still...
from
that,
there
is
inferred
prejudice.
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
central
thrust
of
showing
some
kind
of
prejudice
to
reverse
a
conviction,
set
aside
it,
and...
and
order
a
new
trial
when
there
has
been
no
showing
that
the
quality
of
representation
has
been
affected.
and
in
sullivan,
the
court
held--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--in...
in
holloway,
if
there's
no
inquiry
conducted
by
the
judge,
there's
automatic
reversal.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
judge--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
i...
i
think
that
what
the
court
said
in
wood
about
the
duty
of
inquiry
and...
and...
this
is
somewhat
vague,
i
will
agree,
but
it
said
there
has
to
be
a
clear
possibility
of
a
conflict.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
there's
a
duty
of
inquiry,
but
if
the
duty
is
not
fulfilled
and
a
trial
is
held
and
a...
there's
a
conviction
and
the
defendant
is
seeking
to
overturn
his
conviction,
at
that
point
the
defendant
still
must
show
an
actual
conflict
and
an
adverse
effect
on
the
quality
of
his
representation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
would
say
that
there
would--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
would
say
that
holloway
is
a
special
case
where
prejudice
was
presumed
conclusively
based
on
two
factors.
the
first
is
that
deference
to
the
contemporaneous
judgment
of
counsel
that
he
was
operating
under
a
disabling
conflict,
and
when
he's
representing
that
he's
operating
under
a
disabling
conflict,
it's
not
just
a
representation
that
he
has
a
conflict,
but
that
this
is
going
to
affect
his
performance.
he's
not
going
to
be
able
to
represent
the
defendant
adequately.
and
the
second
is
that
prejudice
inheres
in
the
situation
in
which
a
judge
orders
a
defense
counsel,
over
his
objection,
to
continue
representation
even
though
the
attorney
believes
he
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
perform
adequately.
and
those
two
circumstances
together
create
a
per
se
rule
of
prejudice,
and
it's
a
carve-out
from
the
sullivan
rule.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
now,
wood
is
a
situation
where
the
sullivan
rule
was
applied
in
a
case
in
which
there
was
reason
to
know
a
clear
possibility
of
an
actual
conflict.
and
what
the
court
said
in
that
circumstance
is
that
the
constitution
would
be
violated
if
it
was
found
that
the
lawyer
had
a...
a
conflict
that
influenced
his
basic
strategic
decisions.
and
that
is
the
same
exact
test
as
the
sullivan
test.
there
not
only
has
to
be
a
showing
of
an
actual
conflict
but
an
effect
on
performance
for
there
to
be
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
is
both
an
actual
conflict
and
effect.
that's
what
it
directs
when
it
says
the
words
actual
conflict--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i'm
not
saying
that
they...
he
would
have
had
a
duty
to
discharge
counsel.
he
can
inquire--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--he
can...
first
of
all,
holloway
is
a
situation
where
the
lawyer
himself
is
representing
that
he
cannot
adequately
represent--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
if
he
represents
that
he
cannot
adequately
represent
the...
the
defendant,
and
then
the
district
court
has
to
conduct
an
inquiry.
and
if
the
inquiry
reveals
that
in
fact
representation
can
be
adequately
given,
then
the
judge
need
not
dismiss.
but
if
the
judge
concludes
that
adequate
representation
cannot
be
given,
then
the
judge
should
dismiss.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
after
a
trial
has
been
held
and
the
defendant
is
seeking
to
overturn
his
conviction,
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes,
but
strickland
goes
on--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
no,
because
strickland
goes
on
to
say
that
in
that
situation,
prejudice
is
presumed
only
where
there's
been
an
actual
effect
on...
on
performance,
both
an
actual
conflict
and
an
adverse
effect
on
performance.
what
strickland
says
is
the
defendant
doesn't
have
to
show
the
additional
burden
that
is...
that
is
present
in
most
strickland
cases
of
showing
there's
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
outcome
of
the
trial
would
change.
but
what...
strickland
reaffirms
cuyler
v.
sullivan,
which
requires
both
an
actual
conflict
and
an
effect...
an
adverse
effect
on
performance.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
then
you
have
a
holloway
situation
if
the...
if
the
defendant...
defense
counsel
is
representing
that
he's
operating
under
a
disabling
conflict
and
the
judge
doesn't
conduct
an
inquiry,
then
there's
automatic
reversal
at
that
point.
that's
the
holloway
carve-out.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
there's
a...
there's
a--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
that's
because
of
the
reasons
for
holloway
have
to
do
with
the
deferring
to
the
contemporaneous
representation
of
a
counsel
that
he
is
operating
under
a
disabling
conflict
and
that
is
given
deference,
together
with
the
fact
that
when
somebody
is
ordered
to...
to
provide
representation
over
his
objection,
that
a
certain
amount
of
prejudice
inheres
in
that.
and
that's
why
the
holloway
rule
is
as
it
is.
and
in
this
situation
where
that's
not
there
and
the
defendant
is
seeking
to
obtain
a
new
trial
with
all
the
societal
costs
that
that
entails,
it
is
not
too
much
of
a
burden
for
him
to
be
able
to
identify
a
particular
way
in
which--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--there's
a
certain
amount--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that...
that
was
the
argument,
but
the
district
court
found
against
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--against
the
defendant
on
both
of
those
points.
the
district
court
carefully
examined
the
questions
of
whether
there
was
a
conflict
and
whether
there
was
an
adverse
effect.
those
were
the
correct
inquiries.
and
the
argument
that's
being
made
here
is
that
you
can
skip
the
second
step,
and
it's
our
submission
that
under
cuyler
against
sullivan
and
under
wood
and
under
this
court's
general
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence,
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
an
adverse
effect
on
the
quality
of
representation.
if
the
court
has
nothing
further.
