mr.
robert
j.
wagner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
april
3rd
of
1992,
judge
foster
dismissed
criminal
charges
against
timothy
hall.
she
noted
on
the
docket,
case
removed
from
docket,
defendant
deceased,
and
then
signed
her
name.
3
inches
above
that
reference
on
that
docket
sheet
was
the
name,
bryan
saunders,
in
big
letters,
court
appointed
counsel
for
timothy
hall.
on
april
6th
of
1992,
warrants
charging
walter
mickens
with
the
capital
murder
of
timothy
hall
came
before
judge
foster.
judge
foster
telephoned
bryan
saunders
and
asked
if
he
would
receive
the
appointment
on
that
case.
he
accepted
that
appointment.
this
case
presents
this
court
with
the
extraordinary
circumstances
of
a
judge
appointing
a
lawyer
to
a
death
penalty
case
when
that
judge
knew
or
reasonably
should
have
known
that
the
lawyer
represented
the
victim
at
the
time
of
the
victim's
death.
as
a
consequence,
walter
mickens
has
been
deprived
his
constitutional
rights
under
the
sixth
amendment
to
conflict-free
representation.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
yes,
it
could.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
well,
the
rule
that's
in
place
here,
the
rule
from
holloway
v.
arkansas,
the
rule
from
cuyler
v.
sullivan,
the
rule
from
wood
v.
georgia,
is
an
appropriate
rule,
and
it's
appropriate
because
it
requires
that
the
trial
judge
or
the...
or
the
judge
in
the
case
knows
or
reasonably
should
know
that
there
is,
in
fact,
a
particular
conflict.
so--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--well,
in
holloway
v.
arkansas,
this
court
announced
a
rule
which
if
a
defense
attorney
presents
to
the
court
an
objection
on
the
basis
of
a
conflict
of
interest,
and
the
court
fails
to
inquire
into
that
conflict,
then
prejudice
is
presumed.
and
the
focus
of
the
holloway
decision
was
on
the
court's
responsibility
to
inquire
into
that
conflict.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
well,
the
rule
should
be,
first
of
all,
if
the...
if
the
court
knows
or
reasonably
should
know--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--then
it
should
be
if
there's
an
actual--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--if
there's
an
actual
conflict,
your
honor,
as
opposed
to
a
particular--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--if
the...
the
attorney
is
compelled
to
refrain
from
doing
something
because
of
his
ethical
obligations
to
the
victim,
if
there's
that
compulsion
by
that
defense
attorney
where
he
can't
do
certain
things
for
his--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--well,
and
if...
if
the...
the
judge
in
this
case
had
conducted
that
inquiry
properly
and
had
determined
whether
or
not
mr.
saunders
had
that...
that...
the
compulsion
to
refrain
from
doing
something
on
behalf
of
mr.
mickens,
then
in
fact
that
would
have
been
cured
right
away
and
we
wouldn't--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--send
it
back
and
tell
him
to...
to
do
the
inquiry?
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
well,
because
this
court
has...
has
provided
that
there's
a
fundamental
right
to
conflict-free
representation.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
they
did
in
fact,
your
honor.
but
that's
not
what
the
question
before
the
court
is.
according
to
wood
v.
georgia--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--that's
right.
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
we...
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
under
wood
v.
georgia,
we
aren't
compelled
to
show
an
adverse
effect.
all
we
need
to
show
here
is
an
actual
conflict.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
and
that's
exactly
what
distinguishes
actual
conflict
from
adverse
effect.
with
an
actual
conflict,
there's
a
compulsion
to
refrain
from
doing
something.
with
adverse
effect,
there's
an
actual
lapse
in
representation,
and...
and
that's
a
significant
difference--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--well,
i
would
suggest--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--your
honor,
i
would
suggest,
though,
that
the
key
issue
here
is
in
the
trial
court's
duty
to...
to
inquire
into
a
conflict
that
it
knew
or
reasonably
should
have
known.
and
that
was
the
focus
of
holloway
v.
arkansas.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
your
honor,
i
agree.
but
i
would
suggest
that
in
this
type
of
case,
it's
even
more
dangerous
for
the
defendant
that
the
court
doesn't
initiate
the
inquiry.
in
that
case,
at
least
the
court
knows
and
the
defendant
knows
that
the
co-defendant
is
being
represented
by
the
same
attorney.
in
this
case,
mr.
mickens
never
knew
that
his...
that
his
attorney
had
a
conflict.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
well,
i
believe
that
the
court
should
have
indulged
in
some
inquiry
of
the
client
himself.
the
court
should
have
asked
the
client
if
he
understood
everything
that
was
involved
in
waiving
that
conflict.
and
in
this
situation--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--well,
it
is
that,
but
there's
also
ethical
consideration
4-5
of
the
virginia
code
of
professional
responsibility
which
states
that
anything
obtained
by
mr.
saunders
through
his
representation
of
hall
could
not
be
used
to
hall's
disadvantage.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
well,
i
believe
it
has,
your
honor,
and
it's
been
established
because
mr.
saunders
in
this
case
obtained
confidential
information
from
mr.
hall.
that's
clear
from
the
record.
the
district
court
found
that.
and
in
preserving
those
confidences
of
mr.
hall,
he
was
precluded
from
doing
certain
things.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
first
of
all,
all
of
this
happened
in...
in
juvenile
domestic
relations
court,
and
under
virginia
law,
all
of
those
files,
all
of
that
information
from
that
case
was
confidential
and
couldn't
be
revealed
to
the
public.
but
nonetheless,
even
if
it
was
public,
under
ethical
consideration
4-4
of
the
virginia
code
of
professional
responsibility,
which
governed
mr.
saunders
at
that
time,
he
was
absolutely
required
to
preserve
the
confidences
and
secrets
of
mr.
hall
regardless
of
the
source
or
nature
of
those
confidences--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--i
want
to
get
to
that
point,
and
the
point
is
that
in
death
penalty
cases,
it's
absolutely
essential
that
the
attorney
looks
into
the
background
of
the
client.
in
this
case--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--i'm
not,
your
honor.
i
believe--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--well,
i
also
stress
the
fact
that
this
is
a
sex
case,
judge.
this
is
a
case
of
forcible
sodomy,
and
also
in
that
type
of
case,
it's
absolutely
essential
for
the
attorney
to
look
into
the
background
of
the
defendant--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--it
would
be
true
that
the...
the
attorney
should
look
into
the...
the
background
of
the
victim.
absolutely,
judge.
but
i
think
it's
particularly
true
because
of
the
sentencing
phase
in
a
death
penalty
case.
in
the
sentencing
phase
of
the
death
penalty
case,
the
attorney
needs
to...
or
the
team
of
attorneys
need
to
look
into
the
background
of
the
victim,
need
to
engage
in
a...
in
brainstorming
about
the
background
and
an
investigation
about
the
background.
and
mr.
saunders
couldn't
engage
in
that
brainstorming,
couldn't
engage
in
that
investigation
because
he
had
to
preserve
those
confidences,
and
he
had
a
duty
of
loyalty
to
mr.
hall.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
well,
as
to
the
newspaper
issue,
your
honor,
under
ethical
consideration
4-4,
it
doesn't
matter
where
the
information
is
in
the
public.
that
attorney
has
an
absolute
responsibility
to
maintain
those
confidences
and
secrets.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
well,
because
the
ethical
considerations
in
the
virginia
code
of
professional
responsibility
required
mr.
saunders
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
well,
i
don't
believe
that...
that
an
attorney
under
those
circumstances
can
pursue
anything
from
the
confidences
and
secrets
that
he--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--i
would
simply
suggest,
your
honor,
that
that's
contrary
to
what
is...
is
provided
in
the
virginia
code
of
professional
responsibility.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
as
far
as--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
that's
right.
but
the
fundamental
right
to
conflict-free
representation
is
not
that
you...
you
have
unconflicted
counsel.
it's
that
you
have
conflict-free
representation.
the
fact
that
he
may
have
had
10
unconflicted
attorneys
makes
no
difference
in
this
case.
the
fact
that
he
has
one
conflicted
attorney
is
enough
to
poison
the
well.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
that's
what
we're
suggesting.
if
that
one
bad
apple
was,
in
effect,
trying
to
sabbotage
the
defense
in
that
case--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--no.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
well,
because
if
a
rule
of
law
is
to
be
promulgated
in
this
case,
i
think
that
needs
to
be
anticipated.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
if
you
can
show,
under
holloway
v.
arkansas,
under
cuyler
v.
sullivan,
under
wood
v.
georgia,
that
there
was,
in
fact,
either
an
actual
conflict
and
adverse
effect
or
in
the
event
where
the
judge
failed
to
inquire
into
a
conflict
that
that
judge--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--i
may
have
misspoken.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
that...
that's
right,
but
in
the--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
was
speaking
more
generally
about
general
conflict
of
interest
cases
where
an
attorney
may
be
there
to...
to
sabbotage
the
defendant.
in
that
situation,
if
there
was
no
duty
of
the
trial
court
to
inquire,
then
you
would
have
to
go
the
actual
conflict/adverse
effect
analysis,
and
that
question
will
have
to
be
addressed.
but
if
you're
just
dealing
with
a
situation
in
which
the...
the
judge
knew
or
reasonably
should
have
known
of
the
conflict
and
failed
to
inquire,
then
of
course,
you're
absolutely
right.
there
would
be
no--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--well,
i'm
not
saying
that
it
fairly
frequently
happens.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
i
made
it
because
i
think
it's
a
compelling
point.
i
believe
that...
that
it
can
happen.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
well,
it
may
very
well
be
in
this
case
that
mr.
saunders
was
trying
to
sabbotage.
we
don't
know
all
of
the
confidences
and
secrets
that
he
obtained.
we
don't
know
everything
about
his
reasons
for
accepting
this
case
knowing
that
he
had
represented
the
victim
in
this
case
and
performing
in
this
case
in
the
way
he
did,
failing
to
look
into
a
consent
defense
in
this
case,
failing
to
investigate
critical
information
in
this
case.
we--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--well,
there
would
be
if
we
had--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--what...
what--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--the
district
court,
in
fact,
found
no
prejudice,
your
honor.
and...
and
what
we're
saying
in
this
case
is,
first
of
all,
to
adopt
the
rule
of
wood
v.
georgia,
the
rule
where
if
we
show
an
actual
conflict--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--i
understand,
your
honor.
and...
and
if
you
look
to
the
cuyler
v.
sullivan
case,
cuyler
v.
sullivan
very
specifically
draws
out
a
test
in
which
you
must
show
both
actual
conflict
and
adverse
effect.
if
you
then
look
to
the
dispositional
paragraph
of
wood
v.
georgia,
that
speaks
only
of
actual
conflict,
and
it
speaks
of
it
three
times.
in
wood
v.
georgia,
the
only
requirement
upon
a
showing
that
the
defense
attorney
had
not
inquired
into
the
conflict
but
that
the
judge
knew
or
reasonably
should
have
known
of
the
conflict
is
that
there
be
an
actual
conflict
showing.
and
again,
it's
three
times
in
the
dispositional
paragraph.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
i
don't
believe
that
you
necessarily
show
one
by
showing
the
other.
in
an
actual
conflict
situation,
it's
really
the
potential
of
a
lapse
in
representation
that
the
court
focuses
on.
when
you
get
to
the
actual...
the
adverse
effect,
then
it
is
the
actual
lapse
of...
of...
in
representation.
so,
it's
the
potential
in
the
actual
conflict
versus
the
actual
lapse
in
the...
in
the
adverse
effect,
the
impeded
representation
in
that
case.
so--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--yes.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
did
actually
find...
in
wood
v.
georgia,
did
find
an
actual
conflict,
found
that
there
were
competing
interests,
and
sent
it
back
to
the
trial
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
an
adverse
effect.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
well,
again,
i
would
point
to
the
dispositional
paragraph
and
the
very
language,
the
precise
language
of
the
case
of
wood
v.
georgia
that
said,
we...
you
know,
if...
if
the
defendant
fails
to
inquire
and
if
the
judge
knew
or
reasonably
should
have
known
or
if
the
defendant
fails
to
advise
the
court
of
a
conflict
and
if
the...
the
court
knew
or
reasonably
should
have
known
of
a
conflict
and
failed
to
inquire,
all
that
needs
to
be
shown
is
an
actual
conflict,
and
didn't
mention
adverse
effect.
that...
that's
as
specific
as
i
can
get
in...
in
that
specific
case.
and
you're
right,
your
honor.
i
misspoke.
they
did
not
find
an
actual
conflict
but
sent
it
back
to
the
court
to
determine
if
there
was
an
actual
conflict,
back
to
the...
to
the
court
that...
that
did
the
probation
revocation
hearing
in
that
case
to
see
if
there
was,
in
fact,
an
actual
conflict.
and...
and
that's
what
the
court
found,
just
that
the
court
had
to
find
an
actual
conflict,
and
if
it
did
find
an
actual
conflict,
then
that
case
appropriate
for
reversal.
and
that's
what
we're
asking.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
well,
we
are,
your
honor.
we--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--that's
correct,
but...
but
it
is
the
part--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--no.
i...
i
believe
that
the
holloway
rule
was
extended
in
cuyler
v.
sullivan,
but
the
holloway
rule
focuses
on
the
court's
failure
to
inquire.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
we
are
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
and
the
reason
we're
not
is
because
of
the
component
of
holloway
v.
arkansas
that
deals
with
the
defense
attorney's
advisement
of
the
court
of
the
conflict
and...
and
the
importance
that
that--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--they're
equivalent
to
a
certain
extent,
but
the
fact
that
the
defense
attorney
raised
it
to
the
court
has
a
certain
significance.
as
the
solicitor
general
indicates
in
their...
in
their
brief,
there
is
some
significance
to
the
defense
attorney
raising
that
issue
to
the
court
and
the
court's
compulsion
to
inquire
into
it
at
that
point.
it's
not
as
significant
as
the
trial
court's
role
in
inquiring
into
that
conflict,
but
it
is
significant.
and
wood
v.
georgia
takes
that
significance,
that
component
into
effect
when
it
requires
an
actual
conflict,
a
showing
of
an
actual
conflict--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--well,
i
believe--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--well,
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
the
adverse
effect
prong
would
not
be
required
under
the
circumstances
where
the
judge
knew,
but
we're
not
conceding
that
we
can't
satisfy
the
adverse
effect
prong.
but
you're
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
that...
that's
what
the
district
court
found.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
that...
that
is
the
focus
of
our
case.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
well,
in
cuyler
v.
sullivan,
it
talks
to
a
particular
conflict.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
my
position
is--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--knew
or
should
have
known
of
a
conflict.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
well,
i
don't
mean
to
change
my
position,
your
honor,
but
a
potential
conflict
in
the
context
of
where
we
have
it
in
the
brief
would...
would
essentially
equal
a
particular
conflict.
so,
it
is
a
potential
conflict--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--that's
true,
your
honor.
no.
if...
but
if
the
judge
knows--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--potential
has
to
be,
as
cuyler
describes,
a
particular
conflict.
if...
if
the
judge
knows
that
there's
some
information
that
that
attorney
may
have
obtained
from
a
previous
client,
that
there's
some
kind
of
conflicting
interest
that
needs
to
be
probed.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
that
may
be
conflicting.
that's
right.
there
is
the
potential
for
damage
to
the
defendant.
it's
that
potential
that
the...
the
judge
needs
to
inquire.
it's
the
peril
that
the
defendant
finds
himself
in
by
being
represented
by
a
conflicted
attorney
that
the
judge
has
a
responsibility
to--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--in
that
case,
it's
very
difficult
to...
to
imagine
how
the
judge
would
have
known
of
that
conflict.
so--
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
--if
he
knew
about
it,
then...
then
i
would
suggest
that
that
judge
should
at
least
inquire,
just
take
the
very...
the
very
reasonable
measure,
the
very
simple
measure
of
inquiring
into
the
conflict.
it
takes
a
very
short
amount
of
time,
and
you...
you
alleviate
the
problem
of
all
the
litigation
that
we've
had
in
this
case.
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
j.
wagner
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
thrust
of
the
respondent's
argument
here
is
that
holloway
stands
for
the
proposition
that
if
a
defense
attorney
raises
an
objection
to
the
court
and
the
court
compels
that
representation
over
that
objection,
then
that
is
where
the
prejudice
is
presumed.
if
you
take
this
argument
to
its
logical
conclusion,
then
anytime
a
defense
attorney
raises
an
objection
on
the
basis
of
a
conflict
to
a
court
and
the
court
compels
that
representation
over
that
objection,
then
prejudice
should
be
presumed.
in
other
words,
when
you
have
a
situation
where
a
defense
attorney
raises
an
objection
to
the
court,
the
court
properly
inquires
of
that
defense
attorney
about
that
conflict
and
properly
finds
that
there
is
no
debilitating
conflict
here
and
then
requires
that...
that
defense
attorney
to
proceed
with
the
representation,
then
under
what
the
respondents
say
here,
prejudice
should
be
presumed.
that's
not
what
holloway
stands
for.
holloway
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
trial
court
has
the
duty
of
protecting
the
essential
rights
of
the
defendant.
the
trial
court
has
the
duty
of
seeing
that
the
sixth
amendment
rights
of
a
defendant
are
protected.
and
in
this
case,
the
trial
court
failed
in
that
responsibility.
it
knew
or
should
have
known
of
that
conflict,
failed
to
inquire
into
that
conflict
and
that's
where
the
prejudice
lies
here.
i
thank
the
court.
