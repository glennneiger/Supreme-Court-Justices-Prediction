justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
in
november
of
1997,
the
petitioner
leonard
edelman
faxed
a
letter
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
alleging
that
the
respondent,
lynchburg
college
had
discriminated
against
him
on
the
basis
of
gender,
national
origin,
and
religion.
the
letter
was
not
signed
under
oath
and
it
was
only
after
the
statutory
300-day
period
for
filing
complaints
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
that
edelman
sent
the
eeoc
one
of
its
forms
no.
5
charging
discrimination
verified
under
oath.
the
eeoc
investigated
the
claim
and
issued
edelman
a
right
to
sue
letter.
edelman
filed
an
action
in
state
court
which
the
college
moved
to
the
federal
court
after
edelman
amended
his
complaint
to
a
certain
cause
of
action
under
title
vii.
the
college
then
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
action
because
edelman
had
not
filed
the
charge
with
the
eeoc
within
the
300-day
period.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss
finding
that
edelman’s
unsworn
november
1997
letter
was
not
intended
to
bay
nor
was
it
treated
as
a
charge
within
the
meaning
of
title
vii.
the
district
court
did
not
passed
on
edelman’s
argument
that
his
november
1997
letter
was
a
timely
charge
file
that
even
without
an
oath
and
that
under
the
eeoc
regulations
the
oath
verifying
the
form
5
related
back
to
the
original
letter.
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
majority
held
that
edelman
had
not
filed
with
the
eeoc
in
time
because
the
letter
he
filed
within
the
300-day
period
was
not
signed
under
oath.
the
panel
held
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
foreclose
the
eeoc
regulation
allowing
a
later
oath
to
relate
back
to
an
earlier
charge.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
section
706
of
the
civil
rights
act
requires
a
complainant
to
file
what
the
act
calls
a
charge
with
eeoc
within
a
certain
time
after
the
occurrences
of
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
in
a
separate
provision,
the
statute
requires
the
complainant
to
affirm
or
swear
that
the
allegations
are
true.
neither
these
two
provisions
defines
what
a
charge
is
and
the
term
is
likewise
undefined
elsewhere
in
the
statute.
neither
provision
incorporates
the
other
so
as
to
define
charge
by
necessary
implication
as
a
charge
under
oath.
the
term
charge
is
therefore
open
to
interpretation.
we
think
that
that
eeoc
regulation
allowing
a
later
oath
to
relate
back
to
an
earlier
charge
is
consistent
not
only
with
the
purposes
of
title
vii
but
also
with
background
legal
principles.
because
we
find
the
eeoc
regulation
to
be
not
only
a
reasonable
one
but
also
the
position
we
would
adapt
in
the
absence
of
any
agency
statement,
we
do
not
resolve
any
question
of
what
deferences
do
to
the
agencies
procedural
rules.
in
upholding
the
eeoc
regulation
we
do
not
reach
the
conclusion
drawn
by
the
district
court
and
the
single
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
quite
apart
from
the
oath
issue,
edelman’s
november
1997
letter
was
not
a
charge
under
the
statute
because
neither
he
nor
the
eeoc
treated
it
as
one.
there
is
at
least
some
support
in
the
record
for
this
view
and
we
accordingly
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
it.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
justice
o’connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
