what
what
about
the
other
elements
that
that
that
have
that
that
are
required
by
the
statute
to
be
in
the
in
the
cla-
in
the
charge?
surely
the
commission
has
to
serve
notice
of
the
charge,
including
the
date,
place
and
circumstances
of
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice.
isn't
that
statutory
provision
implicitly
a
requirement
that
the
charge
contain
the
date,
place,
and
circumstances
of
the
alleged
unlawful
practice?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
how
can
how
can
the
statute
be
complied
with?
i
mean,
the
statute,
two
thousand
e
dash
five
b,
clearly
says
that
the
commission
on
receiving
a
charge
shall
serve
a
notice
of
it,
paren,
including
the
date,
place,
and
circumstances
of
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice...
justice
antonin
scalia
charge
doesn't
even
have
to
e-
c-
because
the
commission
hasn't
chosen
to
require
that,
a
charge
doesn't
even
have
to
contain
the
date,
circumstances,
and
place
of
the
alleged
we-
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
it
have
to
contain?
justice
antonin
scalia
been
discriminated
against?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
but
what
you
say
about
about
the
requirement
or
or
nonrequirement
of
of
of
of
of
of
oath,
of
of
it
being
under
oath,
i
think
you
you
you're
going
to
have
to
logically
say
about
other
requirements
or,
a-
a-
a-
as
you
think
them,
nonrequirements
of
the
charge.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
it
come
to
that
position?
it
just
made
it
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
there's
any
statutory
compulsion,
but
just
in
its
in
its
wisdom
and
beneficence,
the
commission
has
decided
that
there
has
to
be
a
certain
minimal
amount
of
information
in
the
charge,
justice
antonin
scalia
provision
to
which
i
refer,
it
would
say
a
charge
has
to
i'm,
we're
not
going
to
bother
an
employer
and
require
him
to
come
back
with
a
response
unless
y-
you
you
haven't
just
come
in
and
said,
i've
been
discriminated
against.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
and
would
also
require
notice
of
of
of
of
a
charge
that
was
imperfect
in
other
respects
within
ten
days
of
receiving
the
charge.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
telephone
in
the
the
requirement
that
it
be
in
writing,
for
example,
that's
a
requirement
the
that
isn't
isn't
particularly
in
the
in
the
statute
of
limitations
provision,
but
it's
a
requirement
that
it
be
in
writing.
justice
antonin
scalia
contact
the
employer
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
a
matter
of
the
regulations.
justice
antonin
scalia
filed.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
suppose
you
have
a
statutory
provision
which
says
that
the
complaint
shall
be
in
writing,
sworn
to
under
oath,
shall
set
forth
the
time,
place,
and
circumstances
of
the
alleged
grievance,
comma,
and
shall
be
presented
to
the
agency
within
one
hundred
days
after
the
alleged
grievance.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
that
that
that
go
that
far?
justice
antonin
scalia
i-
in
these
other
situations
that
you
mentioned,
does
the
court
take
action
against
a
particular
individual
or
require
a
response
from
a
particular
individual
before
the
verification
occurs?
you
see,
that
that
that
that
seems
to
me
the
the
difference
here,
that
you're
you're
saying
the
commission,
within
ten
days
after
re-
receiving
this
unverified
complaint,
has
to
submit
it
to
the
employer
and
ask
the
employer
to
respond
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
d-
does
the
agency
require
verification
to
occur
before
it
will
demand
a
response
from
the
employer?
justice
antonin
scalia
meanwhile
the
the
i
mean,
this
this
could
occur
a
very
long
time
after
the
event
occurred...
justice
antonin
scalia
commission
waits
that
long
to
get
the
verification.
justice
antonin
scalia
aren't,
shouldn't
the
two
be
be
tied
together?
i
mean,
it's
reasonable
to
have
it
relate
back
so
long
as
there
is
no
prejudice
to
the
to
the
employer
from
having
it
relate
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
separate
mistake,
and
whatever
prejudice
comes
from
that
the
employer
is
free
to
raise
on
remand.
justice
antonin
scalia
also
have
to
say,
mr.
bell,
that
that
since
the
complaint
or
the
charge
has
to
be
under
the
statute
in
such
form
as
the
commission
shall
prescribe,
you'd
also
have
to
say
that
if
the
if
the
charge
was
filed
on
nine
by
twelve
paper
and
the
and
the
commission
had
prescribed
eight
and
a
half
by
twelve,
that
it's
ineffective.
justice
antonin
scalia
would...
justice
antonin
scalia
foot
fault
would
would
render
it
ineffective.
justice
antonin
scalia
little
technical
detail
that
that
wasn't
exactly
as
the
commission's...
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
you're
not
asserting
that
our
reading
of
our
own
rules
is
unreasonable,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
if
our
reading
of
our
rules
isn't
unreasonable
and
this
agency
has
simply
read
the
statute
the
way
we
read
our
rules,
then
i
assume
that
this
agency's
reading
of
the
statute
is
not
unreasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
has
asserted
that
that's
not
the
case,
and
i'm
a
i,
if
that
if,
i
i
i
think
we
we
we
have
to
accept
that
unless
you
have
solid
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
that
in
fact
they
think
the
notice
is
normally
given
and
should
have
been
given
when
here
when
the
when
the
charge
was
received...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
unless
you
know...
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
agree
with
you
that
if
if
if
that
is
not
the
policy
and
if
if
they're
being
inconsistent
in
viewing
it
as
a
charge
for
one
purpose
but
not
as
a
charge
for
another
purpose,
then
then
we
have
a
different
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
charge
if
the
charge
is
received
within
fifteen
days
of
the...
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah...
justice
antonin
scalia
where
where
they
will
give
notice
of
an
unperfected
charge.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
won't
give
notice
unless
the
charge
is
received...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
end
of
a
deadline.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
a
section
of
the
handbook
where
that's...
justice
antonin
scalia
that
that's
not
a
page.
justice
antonin
scalia
page
is
down
the
bottom.
justice
antonin
scalia
two
dash
one?
let
me
try
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
i'm
not
sure
that
mead
does
does,
i
don't
un-,
does
does
mead
say
that
that
even
rules
adopted
without
notice
and
comment
are
entitled
to
chevron
deference
so
long
as
they
were
authorized?
i
mean,
i
thought
all
rules
had
to
be
authorized
whether
whether
they
do
notice
and
comment
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
starting
point,
isn't
it?
