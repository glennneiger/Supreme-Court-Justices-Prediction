mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
relation-back
rule
for
verification
under
section
sixteen
oh
one
point
twelve
b
is
a
proper
exercise
of
the
authority
granted
to
the
eeoc
under
section
seven
thirteen
of
title
seven
to
promulgate
procedural
regulations.
the
regulation
is
consistent
with
the
language
of
section
seven
oh
six.
title
seven
requires
that
a
charge
be
verified,
and
the
statute
also
requires
that
a
charge
be
filed
within
a
hundred
and
eighty
or
three
hundred
days
of
the
act
of
discrimination.
but
as
judge
luttig
correctly
observed
below,
these
two
statutory
requirements
are
independent
of
each
other.
specifically,
section
seven
oh
six
e
one
establishes
deadlines
of
a
hundred
and
eighty
or
three
hundred
days,
but
it
applies
those
deadlines
only
to
when,
quote,
a
charge
must
be
filed.
section
seven
oh
six
e
one
does
not
purport
to
establish
a
deadline
for
verification.
conversely,
section
seven
oh
six
b
requires
verification,
but
it
contains
no
deadline
for
doing
so.
that
omission
is
particularly
significant
because
other
requirements
which
are
contained
in
section
seven
oh
six
b
do
have
deadlines.
[inaudible]
mr.
eric
schnapper
o-
i
wouldn't
go
quite
that
far.
the
the
the
commission's
interpretation
of
that,
which
is
embodied
in
section
sixteen
oh
one
point
twelve
b,
concludes
that
a
charge
is
sufficient
if
it
identifies
the
parties
and
contains
a
description
of
the
alleged
discriminatory
practice.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
it
does...
on
the
employer.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it
does
so
provide.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
regulation...
mr.
eric
schnapper
it
i
i
understand
the
regulation
to
require
more
specificity
than
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
i
think
that
you
have
to
read
well,
the
com-
the
commission's
view
is
that
there
is
a-
a-
an
irreducible
minimum
that
has
to
be
in
a
charge.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
statute
expressly
provides
that
the
commission
can
specify
what
information
needs
to
be
in
a
charge,
and
that's
the...
mr.
eric
schnapper
federal
register
recounts
any
any
explanation,
but
i-
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
logical
for
the
commission
to
have
looked
at
that
the
provision
to
which
you
refer
in
in
in
framing
the...
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
w-
w-
what
happens
as
a
practical
matter
where
verification
occurs
after
the
filing
date
is
that
the
employer
is
usually
not
required
to
actually
take
any
action.
mr.
eric
schnapper
your
honor,
i-
it's
our
view
that
the
that
the
court
of
that
the
eeoc
erred
in
not
providing
notice
at
that
time,
and
it's
i
think
it's
clear,
from
a
reading
of
the
compliance
manual,
that
its
own
manual
did
require
notice
at
that
time.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the...
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
it's
our
view
that
that
that
if
the
commission
receives
a
sufficient
charge,
it
must
do
so.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
the
the
statute
requires
that
a
charge
be
filed,
so
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
reduced
to
writing.
mr.
eric
schnapper
commission
probably
could
alter
its
its
its
regulation
and
deem
a
memorialized
phone
call
the
filing
of
the
charge.
mr.
eric
schnapper
and
and
to
to
get
back
to
the
specific
issue
before
the
court,
the
fifth
circuit
excuse
me
the
fourth
circuit
would
have
reached
the
same
result
in
this
case
regardless
of
whether
this
letter,
notice
of
this
letter
or
the
letter
itself
had
been
served
on
the
employer
within
ten
days
of
the
receipt
of
the
letter
on
november
fourteenth.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it
it
th-
it
remains
open
to
the
to
the
respondent
to
raise
those
issues
on
remand,
and
and
we
think
that
that's
the
appropriate
procedure...
mr.
eric
schnapper
f-
for
addressing
it.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
they,
it
was
in
in
our
view,
it
was
improper
to
have
done
that
here,
that
that
the
the
the
statute
doesn't
authorize
them
to
await
verification.
mr.
eric
schnapper
does
identify
some
circumstances
in
which
there
might
be
delay
in
in
in
notification.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
the
federal
rules
require
that
a
notice
of
appeal
shall
be
in
writing
and
shall
be
filed
within
a
certain
period
of
time.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no.
mr.
eric
schnapper
be
the
normal
practice.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
that's
that's
what
occurred
here.
mr.
eric
schnapper
not
in
practice.
mr.
eric
schnapper
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
don't
believe
the
manual
addresses
it.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it's
expressly
authorized
by
the
regulation
in
this
case.
