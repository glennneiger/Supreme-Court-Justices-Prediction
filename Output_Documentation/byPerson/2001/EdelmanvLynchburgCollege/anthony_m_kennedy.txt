good
practice
for
the
eeoc
to
wait
until
after
the
three
hundred
day
period
and
a
verification
before
it
even
notifies...
justice

m.

okay.

any
boy,
i
would
never
read
a
statute
that
way.
justice

but
but
i-
but
in
this
case,
the
a-
the
agency
doesn't
treat
it
as
a
full
charge
until
it's
verified
for
purposes
of
notifying
the
employer.
justice
anthony

you
you
s-
you
you
you
you
want
us
to
accept
this
argument
as
to
what
a
charge
is,
but
then
you
don't
want
us
to
accept
it
for
when
the
employer
has
to
know
about
it
so
the
evidence
doesn't
go
stale.

can
you
tell
me
what
happens,
j-
it's
not
this
case
if
there's
a
rule
in
the
in
the
circuits,
i
don't
think
we
passed
on
it.
justice

is
the
a-
a-
a-
a-
apparent
inconsistency
between
the,
what
the
government
says
at
page
sixteen
of
the
b-
b-
b-
brief
in
su-
in
support
of
granting
the
petition
and
its
representation
here
ex-
explained
by
the
fact
that
at
p-
page
sixteen
the
government
says
the
complaint
must
be,
the
charge
must
be
verified
before
it
requires
a
response,
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
another
requirement
for
simply
notifying
the
employer
that
the
charge
has
been
made?
it
seems
to
me
that's,
