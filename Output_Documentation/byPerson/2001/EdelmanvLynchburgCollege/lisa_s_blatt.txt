thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
ms.
lisa

blatt
it's
not
that
the
it's
not
that
the
agency
is
waiting
for
verification
before
it
gives
notice,
and
if
the
only
thing
missing
from
a
charge
is
verification,
the
agency's
procedures
require
notice
within
ten
days.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
but,
justice
scalia,
the
the
agency's
procedures
required
this
employer
to
have
notice,
whether
or
not
the
november
fourteenth
letter
was
verified,
and
the
employer
then
can
preserve
its
documents
or
or
respond
to
the
charge
or
do
or
do
whatever
it
wants.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
absolutely.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
title
seven
didn't
define
the
word
charge
as
a
verified
charge.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
course
of
business,
the
agency
will
try
to
obtain
a
standard
form
whose
signature
line
contains
an
affirmation,
and
so
the
verification
requirement
will
be
supplied.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yeah,
we
know
of
just
a
handful
of
cases
where
the
charge
just
got
lost
in
the
system,
and
w-
the
consequences
of
that
would
turn
on
two
factors.
