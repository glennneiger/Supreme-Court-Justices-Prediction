mr.
alexander
w.
bell
in
the
mohasco
case,
this
court
taught
that
the
eeoc
may
not
adopt
regulations
that
are
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
mandate.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
o-
justice
ginsburg,
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
permissible
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
justice
ginsburg,
we
we
don't
think
so
because
we
think
what
happened
in
becker
was
a
a
a
harmonization
of
two
rules
of
the
court,
with
a
focus
particularly
on
rule
eleven,
which
in
the
same
rule
which
established
the
requirement
of
the
of
the
signing,
established
the
the
method
to
cure
a
failure
to
sign.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
your
honor,
i
i
believe
that
the
background
principle,
if
you
will,
the
background
legal
principle
of
our
federalism
and
the
background
legal
principle
of
due
process
to
employers
in
fairness
to
employers
in
giving
notice,
was
probably
more
a
part
of
the
applicable
legal
background
here...
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
well,
your
your
honor,
the
the
regulation
here
eliminates
the
filing
deadline.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
well,
your
honor,
there
wa-
the
the
letter
itself
was
never
verified.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
there's
no
indication
that
congress
here
adopted
common
law
pleading
rules.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
there
are
certainly
many
cases
that
hold
that.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
well,
and
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
they
did.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
writing
letters
to
that
effect.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
i
think
that
that...
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
by
the
commission,
i
think
that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
the
statute
seems
to
indicate
that
with
respect
to
the
oh,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
oath
and
writing
requirements.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
do
have
to
do
it
withi-
in
the
method
and
in
the
time
set
out
in
rule
eleven.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
well,
w-
we
see
a
fundamental
difference
between
this
court
harmonizing
rules
over
which
this
court
has
control,
and
the
court
deciding
whether
to
apply
requirements
set
out
in
a
statute
that
congress
used
to
create
a
certain
right.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
your
honor,
i,
there
are
two
reason
we
don't
think
chevron
is
the
correct,
chevron
would
uphold
this
regulation.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
i
i
and
i...
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
well,
a-
again,
i
i
refer
the
court
to
the
government's
brief
in
support
of
amicus
,
o-
of
of
of,
sorry
of
granting
the
writ,
pages
o-
sixteen
and
seventeen.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
that
does,
i
mean,
we-,
i
i'm
not
arguing
with
that.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
i
i
understand.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
your
honor,
th-
the
charge
was
not
sent
to
the
state
until
it
was
put
under
oath...
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
that's
correct.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
the
only
requirement
in
the
handbook
that
we
saw,
i
mean,
the
the
the
handbook
that
was
filed,
that
we
received
on
friday
does
not
mention
oath
at
all.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
as
i
read
this
manual...
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
whether
it
was
just
served
o-
served
on
us
on
friday,
that's
that's
exactly
what
it
says.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
yes.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
that
that
is
the
way
i
read
of,
th-
this
handbook.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
in
looking
at
the
handbook,
your
honor,
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
i
think
it's,
i-
yes,
sir.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
two
dash
one...
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
is
what
what
i
have.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
and
this
of
course,
this
regulation
was
not
passed
with
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
either,
which
under
the
mead
decision
gives
it
less
weight
than
it
might
have
if
i-
if
the
regulation...
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
they
did.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
by
other
proof
e-
your
honor,
i
suppose
w-
w-
we
lawyers
could
differ
on
whether
it's
a
procedural
or
substantive
rule.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
,
i,
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
and
one
of
the
problems
with
this
rule
is
that
there's
no
delegation
of
authority
to
the
agency
to
define
the
term
charge,
which
is,
in
essence,
what
they've
done.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
it
did
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
w.
bell
he
had
it
for
approximately
a
month,
at
least
three
weeks.
