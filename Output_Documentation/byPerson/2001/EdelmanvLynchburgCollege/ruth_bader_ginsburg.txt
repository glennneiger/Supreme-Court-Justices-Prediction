but
here
what
the
employer
wasn't
even
no-
wasn't
notified
until
the
form
on
the
eeoc's
proper
form
that
did
everything,
including
the
verification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
schnapper,
do
you
agree
that
if
you
started
out
with
judge
luttig's
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
those
four
questions
are
alive
and
would
have
to
be...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thank
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
sends
out,
as
you've
described
the
procedure?
it's
called
form
five,
or
whatever
it
is,
that
they
send
to
the
complainant
says
sign,
verify.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
agree
with
mr.
schnapper
that
the
agency
just
missed,
that
they
should
have
given
f-
to
for
the
purpose
of
giving
giving
notice,
sent
that
unverified
charge...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
argument
that
b
comes
before
e,
so
and
to
define
what
a
charge
is,
the
word
charge,
and
then
i-
it's
given
a
certain
description
in
b.

[inaudible]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
judge
luttig
said
that
that
was
a
very
plausible
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
the
reading
that
you
are
saying
is
the
only
proper
reading
is
s-
somewhat
inconsistent
with
this
court's
position
in
becker
against
montgomery
last
t-
term.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
argument
from
mr.
schnapper
and
miss
blatt
that
as
a
background
common
law
principle,
the
the
idea
of
a
curative
amendment
to
provide
a
signature,
to
provide
verification
that
then
relates
back
is
nothing
new.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
the
the
the
commission
should
have
sent
the
imperfect
charge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
what
anybody
is
urging
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
like
an
amended
complaint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
totally
inconsistent
with
what
congress
envisioned?
that
is,
these
complaints
with
the
eeoc
were
not
going
to
be
filed
by
lawyers,
lawyers
who
have
leeway
to
amend
under
the
federal
rules.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
not
whether.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
within
the
time
that
you
had
to
file
the
notice
lacked
a
signature.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thing
that's
here
within
the
thirty,
three
hundred
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
representing
the
government
made
a
representation
before
the
court
this
morning,
that
the
eeoc
should
have
immediately
sent
that
charge
to
the
employer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
its
position
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bell,
this
was
a
deferral
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
case
anything
had
been
done
at
the
state
agency
level?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
f-
the
same
formal
whatever
they
called
it,
form
x,
wh-
when
it
was
sent
to
the
employer
was
also
sent
to
the
state
agency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you,
what
you
have
just
said,
suggests
that
this
compliance
manual
is
i-
is
in
need
of
amendment,
but
the
compliance
manual,
unlike
the
regulation
that
we
have,
is
not
something
that
gets
chevron
deference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
congress
authorized
the
eeoc
to
make
procedural
rules,
didn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
what
these
are.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
procedure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
c
of
the
federal
rules...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
a
rule
of
procedure?
the
relation-back
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
claimant
who
is
filing
the
original
charge,
sends
a
letter,
as
here,
and
then
the
eeoc,
if
it
were
super-efficient,
would
have
gotten
out
the
the
form
in
good
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
days
did
he
have
left?
