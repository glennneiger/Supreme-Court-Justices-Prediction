or
downward,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
downward
or
upward?
or
upward?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know.
and
he
agreed.
[laughter]
i'm
surprised
that
he
agrees.
i...
i
would
think
you
would...
you
would
say
that...
that
it's
only
the
downward
that...
that
saves
the
guidelines.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
suppose
a
judge
could
not
depart
downward
under
the
guidelines,
could
only...
only
depart
upward,
you'd
have
a
mandatory
minimum,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so...
so,
what
you
agree
with
is
that
so
long
as
the
judge,
under
the
guidelines,
has
the
option
of
departing
downward,
you
wouldn't...
this
case
would
not
necessarily
decide
the
guidelines.
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
a
judge
has
discretion,
i
suppose
no
single
fact
requires
a
certain
sentence.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
definition,
where
the
judge
has
discretion,
no
single
fact
requires
a
certain
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
true?
a
judge...
a
judge
has
discretion,
when
he's
making
factual
findings,
to
say
what
is
false?
even
though
he
thinks
one...
one
fact
is
true,
he
has
discretion
to
say
that
it's
not
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
the
question.
does
the
judge
have
discretion
to
say,
even
though
i
know
there
was
brandishing,
i'm
going
to
say
there
wasn't
brandishing.
he
doesn't
have
the
kind
of
discretion.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
suppose
he
has
to
confront
the
brandishing
issue.
he
can't
say,
it's
a
tough
question,
so
you
know,
i'm
not
going
to...
i'm
not
going
to
face
it.
the
law
requires
him
to...
to
decide
whether
there's
been
brandishing
or
not,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
wait.
but
you
would
allow
the
judge
to
increase
his
sentence
on
the
basis
of
the
judge's
belief
that
he
was
brandishing?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
appropriate
sentence
within
his
discretion.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
what
have
you
accomplished
if...
if
they
just
rewrite
the
guidelines
to
say
you
get
5
years
for
brandishing?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
consequence
will
be
that
even
if
the
jury
finds
no
brandishing
as
an
element
of
the
crime,
the...
the
judge
may...
and
indeed,
under
the
guidelines,
must...
add
5
years
for
brandishing
if
he
thinks,
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
there
was
brandishing,
which
is
the
situation
you're
in
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
guidelines
can
require
him
to
give
a
higher
sentence.
if
the
same
higher
sentence
of
5
years
were
mandated
in
the
guidelines,
you
say
that's
okay.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
apprendi
is
just
a
draftsmanship
problem,
really.
so,
i
mean,
it's
bad
if...
if
the
legislature
says,
for
this
crime
you
get
20
years,
but
if
you
brandish
a
weapon,
you
get
another
5.
that's
bad.
so,
the
legislature,
that's
okay.
i'm
sorry.
for...
for
this
crime
you
get
1
to
20,
but
if
you
brandish,
you
get...
you
get
25.
so,
i
say,
okay,
we'll
revise
it
in
light
of
apprendi.
for
this
crime,
you
get...
you
get
1
to
25,
but
if
you
brandish
a
weapon,
it
shall
be
25.
that's
okay,
although
the
other
one
wasn't
okay.
and...
and
it's
up
to
the
judge
to
find
whether
it's
brandishing
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
--defense
bar
complained
about
that,
have
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm...
i'm
unaware
that
they
are...
are
keen
on
getting
rid
of
apprendi.
