justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i...
can
i
go
to
apprendi?
because
the...
i
want
to
just
focus
you
a
little
bit,
assuming
you
lose
on
this
argument.
i
want
to
know...
and
this
is
hard
for
me
because
i
dissented
in
apprendi.
i
want
to
know
how
you,
as
a
person
living
with
the
case,
understands
it.
imagine
two
statutes.
i
just
want
to
know
if
you
think
apprendi
applies
to
the
second
of
the
two
statutes.
the
first
statute
says
the
sentence
is
up
to
10
years
for
robbery,
but
if
a
gun
is
discharged,
up
to
15.
there's
no
question
that
apprendi
applies
to
that
second.
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
apprendi
is
about.
now,
suppose
i
take
that
same
statute
and
i
just
rewrite
the
words
as
follows.
the
maximum
for
this
crime
of
robbery
is
15,
but
unless
a
gun
is
discharged,
you
shall
not
sentence
to
more
than
10.
now,
is
that
second
statute
treated
identically
to
the
first
in
your
understanding
and
the
understanding
of
the
bar?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
both.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
both.
so,
the
wording
of
it
doesn't
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
that's
the
case,
i'd
also
like...
and
this
is
my
other...
only
other
question.
i'd...
i'd
like
to
get
your
understanding.
the
defense
bar,
i
understand,
of
which
you're
an
important
part,
wants
this
extended,
and
my
question
is
why.
and
this
is
my,
why...
what
i
have
trouble
seeing
in
this.
it
seems
to
me
as
a
practical
matter
what's
likely
to
happen
is
the
prosecutor
will
come
in,
and
it's
primarily
about
drug
cases.
and
they'll
say,
fine,
we'll
go
to
the
jury.
you
want
a
trial?
fine.
you
say
you
were
in
chicago?
we
say
that
there
were
two
kilos
of
drugs,
and
then
you
have
to
get
in
front
of
the
jury
and
argue
my
client
was
in
chicago,
but
just
in
case
he
happened
to
be
around,
there
was
only
one
kilo.
now,
that's
impossible
for
you
to
argue.
now,
given
that
kind
of
problem,
why
does
the
defense
bar,
why
do
you,
and
why
does
everyone
else...
why
are
they
so
anxious
to
extend
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
still
under
the
present
law,
if
you
have
a
good
claim
as
to
whether
it's
one
kilo
or
two
and
the
evidence
is
in
dispute,
you
find
the
guilty
verdict
come
in.
at
that
point,
you
go
to
the
judge
and
you
say,
now,
judge,
we
want...
we
want
to
go
into
the
evidence
here
about
how
much
drug
there
really
was.
you
can't
do
that
if
you
have
to
do
it
all
at
the
same
time
in
front
of
the
jury.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
this
court's
case
i
take
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
maybe
we
should
reconsider.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
that's
so,
do
you...
do
you
accept
what...
what
your...
what
the
petitioner
said
in
respect
to
my
second
statute,
if
you
remember
it?
the
second
statute
is,
congress
passes
a
law
and
it
says
the
maximum
for
robbery
is
15
years,
but
if
there
is
no
injury,
then
it's
7
or
5.
now,
does
apprendi
apply
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
if
there
is...
if
the
gun
isn't
discharged.
does
apprendi
apply
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
statute
i'm
talking
about
intends
the
fact
of
discharge
to
be
a
sentencing
factor.
there
is
no
doubt.
i
mean,
i
can
write
it
in
such
a
way
that
that's
clear.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
at
that
point,
apprendi
is
a
constitutional
rule,
and
therefore
does
the
discharger
not
have
to
be
presented
to
the
jury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
so,
then
what
did
you
say
in
your
first
answer?
you've
had
two
parts.
you
had
a...
a
purposive
part
and
you
had
a
historical
part.
now,
did
you
say
anything,
other
than
saying
eloquently
and
in
several
different
ways,
that
apprendi
concerned
a
maximum
and
this
case
concerns
a
minimum,
which
i
am
sure
that
the
petitioners
would
concede?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
that's
certainly
true.
but
what's
bothering
me
about
it
is
every
factor
in
apprendi...
and
i
was
against
apprendi.
i
dissented.
but
having
that
now
being
the
law,
it
seems
to
me
every
factor,
other
than
the
fact
that
this
is
a
minimum
and
that's
a
maximum,
applies
a
fortiori
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
if
you
tell
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
as
far
as
you're
concerned--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
those
are
extensions...
extensions
on
the...
on
the
basis
that
you've
said,
which
i
now
understand,
is
you
say,
well,
there
has
to
be
a
jury
finding
for
anything
that
will
lead
to
a
longer
maximum
term,
the
highest
possible
term.
and
they
say,
yes,
but
if
that's
so,
you
also
have
to
have
a
jury
finding
for
the
shortest
mandatory
term,
because
the
shortest
mandatory
term
is
far
more
important
to
any
individual
defendant
than
the
highest
theoretical
possible
term.
and
i
think
that's
what
their
argument
rests
upon,
and
that
sounds
basically
true.
and
it
doesn't
lead
you
down
the
path
you're
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
there
are
some...
there
are
some
exceptions,
but
they're
saying
in
general.
and...
but
what's...
i
want
to
be
sure
i...
i'm
in
a
slight
dilemma
because
i
think
apprendi
was
not
right.
but
still,
there
it
is.
and
the...
but
the...
the
question...
i
want
to
be
sure
you
finished
justice
o'connor's
question.
my
understanding
is
prospectively
a
ruling
against
you
here
would
not
give
the
government
a
lot
of
trouble.
prospectively
what
you
would
do
is
you
would
simply
charge
in
the
indictment
every
factor
related
to
mandatory
minimums
and
go
and
prove
it.
and
that's
not
herculean.
that
isn't
some
tremendously
difficult
thing
to
do,
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
could
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
having
read
those,
do
you
have
any
impression
in
respect
to
the
practicalities
of
it?
