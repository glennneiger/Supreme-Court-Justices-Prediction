what
about
things
like
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
which
also
have
the
effect
of
increasing
the
range
of
the
penalty
within
certain
limits?
there
are
lots
of
factors
there
that
under
the
guidelines
the
judge
would
still
decide.
under
your
argument,
apprendi
would
throw
all
those
out.
it
has
to
go
to
the
jury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
they
may
be
unconstitutional
under
your
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
question
is
under
your
theory
of
apprendi,
which
imposes
constitutional
limits
on
discretion
for
judges,
that
can
be
given
to
judges,
how
many
of
the
sentencing
factors
are
going
to
fall
by
the
wayside?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
that
presumably
under
your
argument
would
have
to
go
to
the
jury,
whether
he
possessed
a
firearm,
or
the
quantity
of
drugs
involved.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--how...
how
does
a
judge
have
the
opportunity
to
depart
downward
under
the
guideline
if
the
guideline
says
if
he
had
a
gun,
you're
supposed
to
go
up?
i
just
don't
understand
your
argument
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--purpose
is
if
he
has
a
gun,
you
increase
it.
why
isn't
that
an
apprendi
thing
under
your
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
implication
of
apprendi?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
where
we're
headed,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
have
a
sense
of
how
the
application
of
apprendi
is
working
out
in
the
system
now?
i
mean,
how
is
it
being
applied?
what's
happening?
what
has
changed
as
a
result?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
get
it
expanded.
