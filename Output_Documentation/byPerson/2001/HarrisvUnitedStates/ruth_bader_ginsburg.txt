but
as
a
practical
matter,
even
in...
in
this,
suppose
this
judge
thought
that
the...
harris
should
not
have
gotten
more
than
5
years.
so,
he
says,
well,
the
evidence
of
brandishing
could
go
either
way,
so
i
want
to
give
him
5
years.
i'll
find...
i
won't
find
brandishing.
that
kind
of
discretion
you...
the
prosecutor
i
suppose
couldn't
say
anything
about.
a
judge...
a
judge
has
that
discretion
no
matter
what
the
legislature
rules
are.
he
can
say,
it's
a
close
question
whether
brandishing
exists.
therefore,
i
will
not
find
brandishing.
that
will
bring
him
down
to
the
5-year
level.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
i
didn't
say
that
even
if
he
knew.
i
said
if
the
judge
said,
well,
it's
a...
it's
a
tough
question,
so
i'm
not
going
to...
i'm
not
going
to
make
up
my
mind
on
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
close
on
brandishing.
but
he
also
said,
i
would
have
given
this
guy
7
years
no
matter
what;
apprendi,
without
apprendi,
7
years
is
what
i
think
is
right
for
him.
isn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that...
that...
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
it
is
true
that
under
the
guidelines
a
judge
can
find
something
that
the
jury
didn't
find
because
the
standards
are
different,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
the
one
case,
and
the
judge
said,
well,
i'm...
i
would
think,
too,
it
wasn't
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
there
is
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
therefore,
i
find
it,
for
purposes
of
my
guideline
calculation.
that's...
that's
quite
common,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
apart
from
one
being
within
the
jury
zone
and
the
other
not,
is
there
a
rational
distinction
between
saying,
judge,
you
can't
add
on
2
years
at
the
top
and
saying
you
can't
subtract
2
years
at
the
bottom?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
are
you
going
to
say
anything
before
you
get
done
about
the
statutory
construction
question?
because
i'm...
if
we
said
the
statute
is
like
jones,
wouldn't
that
be
the
end
of
it?
