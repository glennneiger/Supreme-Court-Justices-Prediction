h.
souter
but
it's
not
so...
it
seems
to
me
that...
i
understand
your
argument,
but
it's
not
so
clear
as
it
was
in
jones.
i
mean,
the
difference
between
use
and
brandish
is...
is
a...
is
a
smaller
difference
in
degree.
the
difference
in
the
penalties
are
smaller
differences.
it's
just
a
couple
of
years,
the
difference
between
5
and...
and
7,
for
example.
and...
and
i
understand
how
you
can
make
the
argument,
but
i
don't
see
the
argument
as
being
sort
of
a
slam
dunk
in
the
case.
