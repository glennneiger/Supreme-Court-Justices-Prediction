justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
rephrase
justice
breyer's
question
slightly
or...
or
make
the
point
that
i
think
underlies
part
of
his
question.
apprendi
is
not
a...
true
or
false?
apprendi
is
not
an
unmixed
blessing
for
the
defense
bar.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
given
apprendi,
of
course,
you
face
the
problem.
but
looking
at
apprendi
as
an
original
matter,
which
we
cannot...
which
i
think
we're
unlikely
to
do,
it...
it
has...
it
imposes
some
real
disadvantages
on
defendants,
does
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
case
justice
breyer
puts
to
you
shows
a
very
real
difficulty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
of
apprendi.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose...
suppose
the
judge
says,
now,
it's
the
policy
in
this
court
and
in
this
jurisdiction,
counsel,
that
if
you
come
in
and
your
defendant
has
a
gun
or
has
brandished
a
gun,
i'm
going
to
go
upward.
i
want
you
to
know
that.
then
the
case
is
decided,
and
he
said,
you
know,
i
would
have
given
your
counsel...
your
client
six
months
if
he
hadn't
brandished
the
gun,
but
he
brandished
that
gun:
5
years.
and
you
contend
he
didn't
brandish
the
gun.
why
shouldn't
apprendi
control
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so...
so,
in
your
view,
apprendi
stands
for
the
proposition
that
legislatures
cannot
control
judges
in
the
sentencing
process.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
think
apprendi
is
clearly
binding
here,
and...
and
we
have
to
decide
how...
how
it
should
be
applied.
i...
i
do
have
some
problems
in...
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
i
think
the
statute
is
a
little
bit
different
than
jones.
i...
i
don't
agree
that
it's
structurally
the
same.
and
i
really
don't
see
why
this
shouldn't
apply
where
judges
have
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
part
of
my
concern,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
on...
on
remand,
if
you
prevail
here,...
well,
i
guess
there
would
have
to
be
a
new...
a
new
trial
on
the
sentencing
point.
but
suppose
the
judge
says,
you
know,
the
jury
has
found
there's
no
brandishing
because
he
displayed
it
but
they
didn't
think
that
was
brandishing
under
my
instructions.
but
he
did
have
a
gun
and
he
did
show
it,
and
even
if
that
isn't
brandishing,
i'm
going
to
up
it
to
7
years.
he
can
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
brandishing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i'm
quite
surprised
at
that.
i...
i
tried
to
phrase
my...
my
question
to
get
around
that.
i
said
the
judge
accepts
the
jury
finding
that
there
was
no
brandishing,
but
everybody
agrees
that
he
did
at
least
have
a
gun
and
so
he's
going
to
increase
it
for
that.
that
was
my
hypothetical.
but
in
answer
to
justice
scalia,
you
said
the
judge
could
say
i
think
there's
brandishing
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
i'm
surprised
at
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
surprised
at
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
i
can
pile
onto
justice
scalia's
question,
you
now
have
the
worst
of
both
worlds
because
you
have
the
disadvantages
we
referred
to
at
first,
and
yet
the
judge
can
still
go
upward.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
given
the
precedent
of
apprendi,
suppose
the
judge
says,
now,
you
know,
the
jury
finds
an
enhancement
because
of
harassment,
and
the
judge
says,
well,
under...
let
me
begin
again.
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
the
jury
doesn't...
the
judge
said,
you
know,
i
would
ordinarily
give
you
6
months,
but
i...
i
find
there's
a
harassment
here...
or
pardon
me...
brandishing
here,
and
so
i'm
going
to
give
you
5
to
7
years.
true,
it's
a
mandatory
minimum.
true,
that's
different
than
apprendi.
but
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
the
concerns
apprendi...
of
apprendi
are
fully
applicable
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
the
chief
justice
indicates
this
is
harris
versus
united
states,
and
in
this
case
as
in
ring
versus
arizona,
the
opinion
just
announced
today
by
justice
ginsburg,
we
can
consider
a
question
arising
from
the
court's
decision
two
years
ago
in
apprendi
versus
new
jersey.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
violating
a
federal
statute
that
prohibits
defendants
from
using
firearms
during
drug
crimes.
the
statute
sets
no
maximum
sentence,
but
the
minimum
sentence
however
depends
on
findings
made
by
the
sentencing
judge,
and
the
minimum
increases
from
five
to
seven
years,
for
example,
when
the
judge
finds
that
the
defendant
brandished
the
firearm,
and
that
was
the
case
here.
petitioner
was
given
the
seven
year
minimum
after
the
judge
found
that
he
brandished
the
firearm.
he
argues
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
brandishing
should
have
been
treated
as
an
element
of
the
crime
and
if
that
would
so,
it
would
had
been
found
by
the
jury
rather
than
the
judge.
as
the
petitioner
observes
in
federal
prosecution,
each
element
of
the
crime
must
be
alleged
in
the
indictment
submitted
to
the
jury
and
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
apprendi,
this
court
held
that
any
fact
that
increases
the
defendants’
sentence
beyond
the
statutory
maximum
is
an
element.
petitioner
argues
that
under
the
logic
of
apprendi,
any
fact
that
increases
the
defendants’
minimum
sentence
should
also
be
found
by
the
jury.
the
court
rejected
this
argument
in
a
1986
case
called
mcmillan
versus
pennsylvania.
petitioner
says
however
that
mcmillan
is
inconsistent
with
apprendi
and
must
be
overruled.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
statute
and
we
now
affirm.
part
four
of
my
opinion
which
is
the
opinion
for
majority
of
the
court
holds
that
mcmillan
is
still
good
law
and
that
the
statute
is
constitutional.
the
majority
agrees
about
this,
our
reasoning
differs.
part
three
of
my
opinion
is
joined
by
three
other
justices,
the
chief
justice,
justice
o’connor
and
justice
scalia.
that
portion
of
the
opinion
says
that
mcmillan
is
consistent
with
the
apprendi
and
its
logic.
read
together
mcmillan
and
the
apprendi
mean
that
the
facts
that
authorize
the
judge
to
impose
punishment
are
the
elements
of
the
crime.
when
as
in
the
apprendi,
the
facts
found
by
the
jury
allow
the
judge
to
impose
any
sentence
between
zero
and
ten
years,
the
judge
has
no
authority
to
find
a
fact
that
extends
the
sentence
beyond
the
ten
years
statutory
maximum.
this
sort
of
finding
has
traditionally
been
treated
as
an
element
and
found
by
the
jury.
the
facts
that
do
not
increase
the
defendant's
sentence
beyond
the
maximum
are
not
elements.
judges
have
always
had
authority
to
find
facts
beyond
that
affect
the
defendant’s
sentence
within
the
statutory
range.
the
facts
like
brandishing
in
this
case,
facts
that
when
firearm
require
the
judge
to
impose
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
below
the
maximum
authorized
by
the
jury's
verdict
are
not
elements.
the
judge
could
have
imposed
this
sentence
even
he
or
she
had
not
found
the
fact.
for
these
and
other
reasons
we
affirmed
the
court
holding
in
mcmillan.
facts
increasing
the
defendant's
minimum
sentence
but
not
extending
it
beyond
the
statutory
maximum
need
not
be
alleged
in
the
indictment
submitted
to
the
jury
or
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter
and
ginsburg
joined.
