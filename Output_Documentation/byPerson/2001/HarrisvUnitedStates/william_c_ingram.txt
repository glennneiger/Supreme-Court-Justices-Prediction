mr.
william
c.
ingram
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
asking
the
court
to
rule
that
the
brandish
clause
of
18
united
states
code,
section
924(c)
is
an
element
to
be
charged
and
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
not
merely
a
sentencing
enhancement,
based
on
two
separate
and
independent
bases.
the
first
is
the
statutory
analysis
under
jones
v.
united
states,
and
the
second
basis
is
the
constitutional
analysis
under
apprendi
v.
new
jersey.
and
i
will
address
the
jones
argument
first.
the
carjacking
statute
in
jones
v.
united
states
had,
as
additional
elements,
serious
injury
and
death,
which
the
court
held
to
be
additional
elements
after
the
statutory
analysis
was
completed.
and
the
carjacking
statute
in
that
case
and
18
united
states
code,
section
924(c)
in
this
case
are
virtually
mirror
images
of
each
other
structurally
and
grammatically.
the
court
looked
at
the
text
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
behind
those
facts,
and
how
legislatures
historically
had
treated
those
facts
in
determining
that
serious
injury
and
death
were,
in
fact,
elements
to
be
proved
and
not
merely
sentencing
enhancements.
likewise,
we
contend
that
brandish,
based
on
the...
the
text
of
the
statute,
the...
how
legislatures
have
typically
treated
that
fact
and
the
fact
that
it
involves
a
mens
rea
element...
that
is,
brandish
is...
is
defined
as
displaying
or
making
the
presence
known
of
a
firearm
in
order
to
intimidate
and...
and
mens
rea
has
traditionally
been
an
element...
and
then
based
on
the
legislative
history
that
those
statutes
would
lead
the
court
to
conclude,
based
on
the
statutory
analysis,
that
brandish
is
in
fact
an
element
to
be
proved
and
not
merely
a
sentencing
enhancement.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
your
honor,
if
i
may
address
each
of
those
concerns.
the...
first
of
all,
the...
the
fact
that
the
increase
under
the
brandish
statute
goes
from
a
mandatory
minimum
of
5
to
a
mandatory
minimum
of...
of
7
not
being
a
steep
increase,
first
of
all,
it
does
take
the
defendant
40
percent
higher
for
brandishing
from
5
to
7,
and...
and
it
doubles
the
penalty
100
percent
higher
for
discharging
the
firearm,
which
cannot
be
divorced
from
the
brandishing
element.
there
are
cases
from
this
court
in
the
context
of
ex
post
facto
challenges
to
application
of
sentences
that
were
enacted
after
the
defendant
committed
the
crime,
most
particularly
miller
v.
florida,
the
leading
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
where
the
court
held
that
an
increase
in
a
sentence
of
anywhere
from
two
to
two
and
a
half
years
substantially
disadvantaged
the
defendant
and
foreclosed
the
defendant
from
asking
for
a
lower
sentence.
likewise,
in
the
case
of
glover
v.
united
states,
which
we
do
not
cite
in
our
brief...
that
is
at
531
u.s.
198...
the
court
held,
in
the
context
of
a
challenge
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
that
an
additional
guideline
sentence
under
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
of
anywhere
from
6
to
21
months
meets
the
substantial
prejudice
prong
of
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
so,
we
contend
that
the
increase
from
5
to
7
years
is
in
fact
a...
a
substantial
difference.
the
elements
in
question,
comparing
serious
bodily
injury
and
death
to
brandishing,
are
somewhat
different
in
that
the
serious
bodily
injury
and
death
are
results,
whereas
brandish
and
discharge
are
conduct
of
the
defendant.
but
we
contend
that
the
brandish
and
discharge
being
treated
more
seriously
are
seeking
to
address
the
same
possible
results;
that
is,
if
a
defendant
merely
carries
a
firearm
or
possesses
a
firearm,
it
is
far
less
likely
that
serious
bodily
injury
or
death
will
result
than
if
the
defendant
brandishes
or
discharge...
discharges--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--i
agree
with
that.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
yes.
my
understanding
is
that
apprendi
would
cover
the--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--latter
statute
that
you
have
described.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
no.
i
contend
that
it...
it
does
not.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
your
honor,
that
is
not
a
problem
that
the
defense
bar
does
not
already
face.
in...
in
the
context
that
you
described
in
a
drug
case,
in
federal
court
now
the
evidence
presented
at
trial
will
involve
both
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
evidence,
as
well
as
quantity
evidence.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
as
a
practical
matter,
in
federal
court,
the...
the
federal
judges
at
sentencing
rely
on
the
trial
evidence.
so,
a
defense
attorney
knows
during
trial
that
i
am
hearing
evidence
about
quantity
that
i
want
to
dispute
because
i
know
it's
going
to
come
up
later
in
a
sentencing
hearing,
but
i
don't
dare
do
that
here
because
i
am
telling
the
jury
that
there
was
no
possession
at
all.
so,
it
is
a
dilemma
that
we
face
now
and...
and
faces
attorneys,
for
example,
in
cases
where
you
admit
my
client
did
kill
someone,
but
not
with
malice
aforethought.
quite
often
you
do
have
to
negate
additional
elements,
and
you
do
have
that
dilemma
already.
this
would
not
create
any
new
dilemma
for
us.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
i
think
it
can
create
some
problems,
as
we
just
described,
but
they're
not
problems
that
we
don't
face
in
other
areas
and
on
other--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--i
do
not
think
they're
real
disadvantages.
i
think
they're
just...
they're
just
some...
some
difficulties
that
defense
attorneys
face
all
the
time.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
and
as
i've
described,
that
is
a
difficulty
that
we
face
already.
and...
and
the
important--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--no,
your
honor.
before
apprendi.
that
problem
faced
defense
attorneys
in...
in
a
number
of
contexts.
and...
and
we're
really
more
concerned
here
not
so
much
with
the
problems
it
creates,
because
they're
not
new
problems,
but
with...
with
the
fact
that
mandatory
minimums
add
additional
deprivations
of
liberty
that
should
be
addressed
by
the
jury
and
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
not...
not
left
to
the
discretion
of
trial
judges,
based
on
the
case
law
of
this
court,
including
apprendi
itself.
we
are
relying
on
the
constitutional
rule
announced
in
apprendi.
prior
to
apprendi,
in...
in
mcmillan
and
patterson,
the
court
had
acknowledged
that
there
were
some
limits,
some
constitutional
limits
to
what
a
legislature
could
do
in
defining
the
elements
of
a
crime.
but
it...
the
court
had
never
announced
exactly
what
those
limits
are.
now,
it
is
true
that
apprendi
was
limited
to
an
increase
in
statutory
maximums
because
that
is
what
the
case
was
about.
those
were
the
facts
of
the
case.
but
the
constitutional
rule
that
was
the
underpinning
of
the
apprendi
holding
was
that
as...
as
stated
by
the
majority
in
endorsing
the
concurring
opinions
in
jones
as
follows,
it
is
unconstitutional
for
a
legislature
to
remove
from
the
jury
the
assessment
of
facts
that
increase
the
prescribed
range
of
penalties
to
which
a
criminal
defendant
is
exposed,
and
equally
clear
that
they
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so,
the
constitutional
rule
of
apprendi
was
any
fact
that
increases
the
range,
either
the
floor
or
the
ceiling,
of
the
prescribed
penalties
are
constitutionally
elements
that
must
be
alleged
by
the
defendant...
by
the
prosecution
in
the
charging
document
and
must
be
proved.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
i
disagree,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--and
i
do
agree
with
your
statement
that
there
are
lots
of
things
that
the
guidelines
allow
the
judges
to
consider.
first
of
all,
mandatory
minimums
are
just
that.
they
are
mandatory.
they
do
not
allow
a
judge
to
consider
any
mitigating
factor,
however
strongly
the
judge
may...
may
believe
in
those
mitigating
factors,
to
go
below.
the
sentencing
guidelines,
first
of
all,
expressly
allow
the
judge
to
consider
a
number
of
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
they
are
not
because
we
contend
that
the
guidelines,
unlike
mandatory
minimums,
still
leave
the
judge
with
lots
of
discretion.
in
koon
v.
united
states,
this
court--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--i...
i
submit
that
none
of
them
will
because
none
of
those
factors
mandate
a
particular
penalty
to
the
exclusion
of
any
mitigating
offense.
for
example,
under
the
drug
guideline,
if
the
defendant
possessed
a
firearm,
then
in
a
sense
a
two-level
increase
is
mandated
or
called
for,
but
that
nevertheless
still
allows
the
judge,
without
a
koon
discretionary
departure--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--no,
it
is
not,
your
honor,
because
the
judge
in
such
a
case
would
still
have
the
ability
to
depart,
or
first
of
all,
to
reduce
the
offense
level
for
other
mitigating
facts
in
the
case.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
the...
the
sentencing
guideline
range,
once
established,
is
mandatory
unless
and
until
the
judge
determines
that
there
is
a
legally
permissible
basis
to
depart
downward
or
upward.
and
koon
recognized
that
there
are
innumerable
bases
for
allowing
the
judge
to
exercise
that
discretion.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
well,
i
think
it
is
in
this
case.
the...
the
fact
that
the
judge
can
depart
downward--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--you
would
have.
but
that...
that--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--that
is
correct.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
because
that--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--because
the
judge
still...
that...
that
does
not
bind
the
judge
at
that
level.
the
judge
still--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--because
the...
the
constitutional
rule
announced
by
the
court
is
that
if
a
legislature
mandates
an
increase
in
the
prescribed
range
of
penalties.
in
the
case
you've
described,
your
honor,
the
judge,
although
he
says
i
would
still...
i
will
always
go
up,
he...
he
still
has
the
freedom
to
not
go
up.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
and...
and
he
is
subject
to
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
on
appeal.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
no.
my...
my...
in
a
sense
that
is
true.
my
position
is
constitutionally
that
legislatures
have
the
power
to
determine
what
conduct
they're
going
to
criminalize
and
to
define
the
elements
and
the
prescribed
punishment
for
those
elements
as
long
as
it
is
not
cruel
and
unusual.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
is
your
question
why
would
this...
why
would
the
apprendi
doctrine
not
apply
where
the
judge
has
discretion?
mr.
william
c.
ingram
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
constitutionally
the...
the
rule
announced
in
apprendi
is
that
where
a
legislature
mandates
a
particular
mandatory
minimum
or
maximum,
then
that
is
where
the
constitutional
demands
that
the...
those
facts
be
tried
by
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
that
is
true.
if
he...
if
he--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--no.
your
honor,
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
he
has
discretion
to
make
fact
finding.
that...
that
is
always--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--no,
he
does
not,
and
i
misunderstood
the
question
then.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
our
position
is
once
the
judge
does
conclude,
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
brandishing
exists,
he
has
no
authority
to
give
anything
less
than
the
mandatory
minimum,
no
matter
what
other
mitigating
facts
he
may
conclude
may
be
present
in
the
case.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
he
is
bound
by
that.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
yes.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
yes,
it
does,
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
and
we
contend
where
the...
under
the
constitutional
rule
in
apprendi,
that
increasing
the
mandatory
minimum
makes
that
fact
an
element
that
must
be
found
not
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
but
by
the
fact
finder
at
trial
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
all
the
more
important,
because
in
this
case,
the
judge
noted
that
it
was
a
close
case,
and
therefore
the
standard
of
review
becomes
all
the
more
important
in...
as
illustrated
by
this
case
that--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--that
is
what...
that
is
what
he
at
least
implied
strongly.
but
he
cannot
do
that...
if...
if
we
prevail
here
and
we
go
back
for
a
resentencing,
the
judge
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
give
more
than
5
years.
that
is
the...
the
guideline
sentence.
there's
no
guideline
range
for
this.
the
guideline
is
the
mandatory
minimum
sentence.
the
judge
will
not
be
allowed
to
give
more
than
5
years
unless
he
identifies
a
legally
permissible
basis
for
an
upward
departure.
and
in
that
case,
he
can
increase
above
the
5-year
mandatory
minimum.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
then
yes.
if
a
jury
concluded
that
the
defendant--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--did
not
brandish...
that
is,
if
it
was
considered
to
be
an
element
and
the
jury
determined
that
he
did
not
brandish...
then
first
of
all,
he
would
be
not
guilty
of
the
crime,
because
that
would
be
an
element
that
must
be
proved,
and
any
element
that
is
not
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
means
that
he
would
be
not
guilty
of
the
crime.
but
if
there,
for
example,
was
some
accompanying
charge
that
the
defendant
was
found
guilty
of
and
not
the
brandishing,
then
certainly
the
judge
would
have
the
discretion
to
consider
whether
the
firearm
was
brandished
or
discharged.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
well,
that
is
true.
by
saying
he
would
be
acquitted
and
found
not
guilty,
it
would
be
of
the
separate
offense
of
brandishing
the
firearm.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
yes.
that...
that
is...
although
i
do
not
agree
with--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--with
that
policy,
nevertheless
that
is...
that
is
the
case
under
the
status
of
the
law
now.
where
a
defendant
is
found
not
guilty,
for
example,
of
substantive
drug
offenses,
at
sentencing,
the
judge
is
allowed
to
conclude
beyond...
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
those
quantities
were
possessed
and,
in
fact,
should
count
against
the
defendant
for
sentencing
purposes.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
we
are
suggesting
that
brandishing
must
be
proved--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--by...
by
saying
that
the
brandish
must
be
an
element
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
we
are
not
contending
that
if
the
jury
finds
the
defendant
not
guilty
on
that
particular
element,
that
the
judge
might
not
be
able
to
consider,
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
fact,
in...
in
addition
to
any
other
number
of
mitigating
and
aggravating
facts,
in...
in
determining
the
appropriate
sentence.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
that
is
correct.
he
could
not--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--it
is...
it
is
quite
common
that
the
judge
finds
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
both
conduct
that
was
not
even
charged
and
conduct
that
was
charged
and...
of
which
the
defendant
was
found
not
guilty,
because
of
the
difference
in
the
standard
of
proof.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
that
is...
that
is...
i'm
not
happy
with
that
either,
but
that
is
the
case
law
and
that
is
the
law
as...
as
it
stands.
mr.
william
c.
ingram
what
we
will
have
accomplished--
mr.
william
c.
ingram
--no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
if
this
is
an
element
to
be
proved
at
trial,
and

mr.
william
c.
ingram
responding
to
the
questions
about
the
effect
that
a
ruling
in
our
favor
will
have
on
the
lower
courts,
first
of
all,
as
noted,
there
will
be
no
prospective
impact.
the
government
in
the
federal
context
is
already
alleging
drug
amounts,
is
already
alleging
brandish
and
discharge,
and
it's
a
very
simple
matter
for
the
government
and
the
prosecution,
either
the
state
or
the
federal
courts,
to
allege
and...
and
prove
these
additional
facts.
retroactively,
there
will
be
some
cases
that
will
be
sent
back.
they
will
not
be
sent
back
to
set
aside
guilty
verdicts
or
guilty
pleas.
they
will
simply
be
sent
back
for
resentencing,
consistent
with
the
opinion
in
this
case,
just
like
they
were
with
apprendi.
there's
not
nearly
the
flood
of
remands
on
apprendi,
and
bailey
for
that
matter,
as
the
government
contends,
but
in
any
event,
however
many
there
are,
if
the
constitution
demands
it,
then
so
be
it.
the
government
is
concerned
that
a
ruling
in
our
favor
will
undermine
legislatures'
concerns
about
limiting
judicial
discretion
in
sentencing
by
enacting
mandatory
minimums.
those
statutes,
the
statute
in
this
case
in
particular,
and
any
statutes
enacting
mandatory
minimums
in...
in
the
state
courts
will
not
go
away
with
a
ruling
in
our
favor.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
government
will
simply
have
to
allege
and
prove
the
additional
fact,
further
limiting
the
judge's
discretion,
whereas
currently
the
judge
has
discretion
to
determine,
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
whether
or
not
a
fact
exists
or
not.
once
a
jury
finds
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
it
does,
the
judge
has
no
more
discretion
and
must
impose
the
mandatory
minimum.
and
as
has
been
pointed
out
and
we
point
out
in
our
brief
and
reply
brief,
we
contend
that
mandatory
minimums,
as
a
practical
matter,
are
far
more
important
increases
at
the
bottom
level
than
the
possible
increases
at
the
top
of
a
sentencing
scheme
would
be.
and
finally,
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
extend
the
constitutional
rule
announced
in
apprendi.
apprendi
was
limited
by
its
facts,
but
the
constitutional
rule
announced
was
that
it
is
unconstitutional
for
a
legislature
to
remove
from
the
jury
the
assessment
of
facts
that
increased
the
prescribed
range
of
penalties.
a
mandatory
minimum
increases
the
prescribed
range
of
penalties.
we
are
simply
asking
the
court
to
apply
the
constitutional
rule
announced
in
apprendi
to
the
facts
of
our
case
and...
and
ask
the
court
to
rule
in
our
favor.
