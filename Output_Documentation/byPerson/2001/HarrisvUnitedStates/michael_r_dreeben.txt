mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
decision
in
mcmillan
v.
pennsylvania
forms
the
backdrop
for
both
the
statutory
and
the
constitutional
questions
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
the
amended
section
924(c)
creates
one
crime
with
a
minimum
of
5
years
and
a
maximum
of
life
in
prison
and
then
gives
the
sentencing
court
additional
guidance
as
to
where
the
penalty
shall
be
set
within
that
5-year-to-life
range.
the
increase
in
the
mandatory
minimums
does
not
run
afoul
of
the
apprendi
rule
and
is,
in
fact,
specifically
endorsed
by
this
court's
decision
in
mcmillan.
and
on
the
constitutional
question,
this
court's
decision
in
mcmillan
16
years
ago
established
that
it
does
not
violate
the
constitution
for
a
legislature
to
choose
one
fact
that
has
historically
borne
on
the
appropriate
penalty
to
be
assessed
at
sentencing
and
give
the
judge
guidance
as
to
what
that
sentence
shall
be.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
kennedy,
there
are
several
significant
differences
between
the
issue
in
a
case
like
this
and
the
issue
in
a
case
like
apprendi.
in
apprendi,
the
judge
could
not
go
above
the
jury's
verdict
based
on
the
court's
constitutional
analysis.
in
other
words,
the
jury
sets
the
outermost
limit
that
the
judge
can
do,
and
in
the
sense
of
protecting
the
jury
trial
right,
the
apprendi
rule
tracks
onto
what
the
jury
must
find.
here,
regardless
of
what
the
jury
finds,
the
judge
has
the
discretion
and
the
authority
to
sentence
the
defendant
between
5
years
and
life
in
prison.
what
the
mandatory
minimum
takes
away
is
not
a
jury
trial
right,
but
a
right
to
judicial
discretion
to
give
a
lower
sentence
than
the
mandatory
minimum
calls
for.
but
apprendi
was
not
about
protecting
judicial
discretion.
apprendi,
in
fact,
limited
judicial
discretion
and
said
that
the
judge
cannot
go
above
the
maximum
that
the
jury's
facts
have
determined.
here
the
judge
is
not
doing
anything
that
he
could
not
do
based
on
the
jury's
verdict
anyway.
all
that
is
happening
is
that
he
is
losing
the
discretionary
power
to
give
less,
and
that
judicial
discretion
interest
is
not
the
interest
that
was
at
stake
in
apprendi.
that's
reinforced
by
the
fact
that
the
history
that
this
court
relied
on,
as
one
of
its
key
determinants
in
the
apprendi
decision,
is
not
present
in
this
case.
the
history
in
apprendi,
the
court
concluded,
showed
that
it
has
been
the
rule
down
centuries
into
the
common
law
that
the
judge
cannot
give
a
higher
sentence
than
based
on
the
facts
that
the
jury
has
determined.
but
there
is
no
comparable
historical
rule
that
would
support
a
preclusion
of
judicial
discretion
within
the
otherwise
applicable
range.
the
history
of
sentencing
in
this
country
shows
that
within
the
maximum
sentence
established
by
the
jury
verdict,
judges
have
been
often
given
tremendous
amounts
of
discretion
on
what
sentence
they
should
impose.
but
the
history
of
sentencing
also
reveals
that
legislatures
have
frequently
intervened
in
order
to
establish
more
precise
rules
to
govern
that
discretion.
and
the...
therefore,
there
is
no
broad
historical
rule
that
is
contradicted
by
a
statute
like
the
one
in
this
case
and
the
one
that
was
at
issue
in
mcmillan.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
might,
justice
breyer.
the
crucial
question
is
whether
that
statute
has
created
an
affirmative
defense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
it's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--as
i
understand
apprendi,
it
would.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
significance
of
it
concerning
a
minimum
is
that
under
this
statute,
once
the
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
guilty,
using
or
carrying
a
firearm
during
in
relation
to
an
underlying
drug
trafficking
offense,
the
judge
has
the
authority
by
virtue
of
that
jury
verdict
to
sentence
from
5
years
to
life
in
prison.
that's
what
the
statute
means.
what
the
mandatory
minimum
provision
does
is
say,
within
that
range,
we
want
this
defendant
sentenced
to
not
less
than
7.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
two
most
significant
factors,
as
i've
tried
to
say...
and
i'll
try
one
more
time...
is
that
in
apprendi,
the
defendant
could
not
have
gotten
a
sentence
above
10
years
based
on
the
jury's
verdict
alone.
it
took
an
additional
finding
by
the
judge
to
send
him
into
the
realm
where
the
maximum
was
now
20,
and
then
he...
apprendi
got
12.
in
this
case,
once
the
jury
or,
as
it
happens,
the
judge...
the
defendant
waived
a
jury
trial...
assigned
a
finding
of
guilt
to
the
defendant,
the
statute
said,
your
sentence,
mr.
harris,
is
between
5
years
and
life
in
prison.
and
the
statute
comes
along
and
doesn't
give
the
judge
the
authority
to
do
something
that
he
could
not
have
done
before.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
difference
in
that
statute,
justice
scalia...
and
i
agree
that
that
would
not
trigger
the
rule
that
this
court
announced
in
apprendi...
is
that
as
the
court's
opinion
in
apprendi
notes,
if
congress
writes
the
second
kind
of
statute
and
says
the
range
is
1
to
25,
it
is
exposing
all
defendants
who
are
sentenced
under
that
statute
to
a
possible
sentence
of
25
years.
and
the
court
said
that
structural
democratic
constraints
exist
to
deter
legislatures
from
enacting
statutes
with
more
draconian
maximum
penalties
than
they
think
are
appropriate
for
the
worst
of
the
worst
who
are
going
to
be
sentenced
under
that
statute.
now,
here
when
congress
amended
section
924(c),
it
went
from
a
statute
that
had
determinate
sentences.
previously
whatever
you
did
under
924(c),
the
judge
had
no
sentencing
discretion
at
all.
it
was
just
5
years
or
20
years
or
30
years.
congress
changed
that
and
said
this
is
a
more
serious
crime.
this
is
a
crime
which,
if
you're
convicted
of
it,
you're
going
to
get
at
least
5
years
with
an
implied
maximum
all
the
way
up
to
life
in
prison.
by
virtue
of
doing
that,
congress
envisioned
that
there
would
a
spectrum
of
offenders
under
section
924(c),
some
of
whom
are
going
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
tier
and
are
just
the
least
worst
offenders
under
that
statute.
they'll
get
5
years.
others
are
going
to
be
the
worst
of
the
worst.
they
are
going
to
get
a
sentence
that
will
be
closer
to
the
top
of
the
statute.
within
that
range,
congress
gave
to
the
sentencing
judge
additional
guide
points
of
how
to
exercise
that
discretion.
for
someone
who
brandishes,
that's
a
little
worse
than
simply
using;
he
should
get
at
least
7
years.
for
someone
who
discharges...
that's
an
increment
worse
yet...
it's
10
years.
but
there's
still
all
of
the
head
room
up
to
life
in
prison
that
congress
established
for
this
offense.
it
doesn't
violate
the
eighth
amendment
for
congress
to
say
that
someone
who
brings
a
gun
into
a
drug
or
a
violent
crime
has
committed
a
serious
offense.
we
want
the
judge
to
have
up
to
life
in
prison.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
stevens,
it's
unclear
what
impact
this
decision
will
have
on
the
sentencing
guidelines,
i
assume
on
the
assumption
that
the
court
extends
apprendi
to
mandatory
minimums.
the
sentencing
guidelines
are
like
mandatory
minimums
in
certain
respects.
they
provide
ranges,
once
the
judge
has
determined
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
the
defendant's
conduct
and
criminal
history,
that
by
statute
the
judge
is
to
give
a
sentence
within.
but
they
differ
from
mandatory
minimums
in
that
the
statute
further
says
that
the
judge
can
depart
from
the
guidelines
sentence
based
on
an
aggravating
or
a
mitigating
fact
that
distinguishes
the
case
from
the
kinds
that
the
guidelines'
drafters
had
in
mind.
now,
the
guidelines
are...
are
different
primarily
in
that
there
is
a
broader
range
of
discretion
available
for
the
judge
to
depart
than
there
is
under
a
mandatory
minimum.
i
emphasize
that
this
is
a
question
of
degree
rather
than
one
of
kind
because
even
these
mandatory
minimums
under
section
924(c)
can
be
departed
from.
if
the
government
makes
a
motion
that
says
the
defendant
has
rendered
substantial
assistance
to
the
government
in
the
prosecution
of
others,
that
authorizes
the
judge
to
depart
from
what
is
otherwise
a
mandatory
minimum.
that
same
ground
for
departure
also
exists
within
the
guidelines,
and
it
accounts
for
more
than
half
of
the
departures
that
exist
in
the
guidelines.
now,
the
guidelines
do,
of
course,
provide
a
further
zone
of
less
guided
discretion
to
the
judge
in
when
he
can
depart.
and
if
this
court
rules
against
the
government
in
this
case,
we
will
be
back
saying
that
that
zone
of
discretion
distinguishes
the
guidelines.
whether
the
court
agrees
with
that
or
not
will
be
an
open
question.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
not
in
the
sense
that
your
honor
is
asking
the
question.
but
i...
i
do
wish
to
underscore
that
there
is...
there
is
a
range
of
ways
that
congress
can
draft
statutes
and
the
states
can
draft
statutes.
under
the
drug
statutes,
for
example,
there's
not
only
the
substantial
assistance
departure
that
i've
mentioned,
but
there's
also
a
departure
for
first-time
offenders
called
the
safety
valve.
now,
that
adds
an
additional
amount
of
discretion
to
the
judge.
and
any
constitutional
rule
that
this
court
develops
for
mandatory
minimums
is
going
to
have
to
be
very
careful
in
articulating
how
much
discretion
is
enough
in
order
to
make
the
mandatory
minimum
no
longer
mandatory
and
no
longer
minimum.
it
could
be
that
the
availability
of
the
substantial
assistance
departure
is
enough
to
take
it
out
of
a
rule
that
says
never
means
never,
and
if...
if
congress
says
never,
then
the
judge
can't
make
the
finding.
that
is
precisely
why
we
urge
the
court
to
adhere
to
mcmillan
v.
pennsylvania
which
held
16
years
ago
that
it
is
permissible
for...
for
the
legislature
to
provide
additional
guidance.
and
the
court
left
open
the
possibility
that
particular
statutes
may
fall
under
a
constitutional
rule,
but
it
didn't
prescribe
the
sort
of
rigid
rule
that
petitioner
is
advocating
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
rational
distinction,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
in
the
former
case,
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
that
has
to
find
him
guilty
on
all
the
facts
that
are
going
to
determine
the
longest
possible
time
that
he
can
spend
in
prison.
under
this
statute,
even
if
he
does
have
a
jury
trial
right
to
brandishing...
just
suppose
that
he
did;
suppose
that
congress
gave
it
to
him
so
we
eliminate
the
constitutional
question...
the
jury
could
find
him
not
guilty.
and
the
judge
could
still
say,
well,
i
think
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
you
did
brandish,
and
exercising
my
discretion,
i'm
going
to
give
you
exactly
the
same
7
years
that
the
statute
called
for.
the
fact
that
that
can
happen
shows,
i
think,
that
the
right
that's
in
play
here
is
not
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
that
will
protect
the
defendant
against
the
possibility
of
this
increased
punishment.
it
is
the
right
to
have
a
judge
with
unlimited
discretion
not
to
impose
the
mandatory
minimum
even
if
he
finds
brandishing,
because
that
is
the
distinction
that
i
think
both
petitioner
and
i
draw
between
the
sentencing
guidelines
and
this
mandatory
minimum.
and
the
right
to
judicial
discretion
is
simply
not
the
apprendi
right.
it's
not
a
right
that's
been
historically
recognized.
and
if
this
court
were
to
accept
respondent's...
or
petitioner's
analysis
of
the
constitutional
rules
that
govern
here
as
being
drawn
from
the
ex
post
facto
cases,
which
is
essentially
what
he
relied
on
in
his
reply
brief
and
in
this
court,
the
court
would
have
to
fashion
a
far
more
sweeping
constitutional
rule
than
would
address
merely
mandatory
minimums,
because
the
ex
post
facto
cases
are
triggered
by
any
substantial
disadvantage
to
the
defendant.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
substantial
disadvantage
that
can
only
be
proved
as
an
element
of
the
crime.
the
ex
post
facto
cases
apply
to
the
withdrawal
of
good-time
credits.
they
apply
to
the
sentencing
guidelines,
as
the
court
held
in
miller
v.
florida.
they
would
presumably
apply
to
the
withdrawal
of
an
affirmative
defense
after
the
defendant
committed
his
crime.
and
petitioner,
by
relying
on
that
test,
essentially
says,
i
want
a
rule
that
means
that
anytime
i
am
substantially
disadvantaged
by
one
aspect
or
another
of
the
criminal
laws
of
a
state,
the
jury
must
find
those
facts.
all
facts
that
are
germane
to
my
punishment--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
hope
not,
justice
o'connor,
because
i
think
that
the
apprendi
rule,
as
bounded
by
the
history
that
the
court
relied
on
and
the
explicit
statements
of
its
holding,
coupled
with
the
court's
recognition
that,
yes,
legislatures
can
write
statutes
that
will
achieve
similar
results
to
apprendi
but
will
do
it
in
an
acceptable
form,
all
of
those
things
suggest
that
the
court
did
not
have
a
broad
ruling
on
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
retrospectively
apprendi
has
caused
a
considerable
amount
of
judicial
chaos
as
courts
have
attempted
to
sort
out
harmless
error,
plain
error,
and
retroactivity
considerations,
one
of
which
is
before
the
court
next
month
in
the
cotton
case.
prospectively,
the
united
states
has
responded
to
apprendi
by
having
facts
that
raise
the...
the
maximum
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
and
it
does,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
cause
some
complications
in
particularly
intricate
conspiracy
cases
where
the
jury
has
to
make
separate
determinations
as
to
each
conspirator.
it
also
creates
the
kinds
of
issues
that
justice
breyer
was
talking
about
for
defendants
who
are
hampered
to
some
extent
in
their
ability
to
present
dual
alternative
defenses
of
the
nature,
i
wasn't
involved
in
this
conspiracy,
but
if
i
was,
i'm
only
accountable
for
a
certain
amount
of
drugs,
because
the
jury
is
being
asked
to
make
that
determination.
once
the
jury
makes
it
affirmatively,
the
judge
is
not
going
to
be
in
a
position
at
sentencing
to
second
guess
that.
so,
apprendi
does...
does
restrict
the...
the
defendant's
ability
to
make
a
defense--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
defense
bar
has
been--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--their
primary
desire
to
date
so
far,
justice
scalia,
has
been
to
get
all
of
the
old
sentences
in
the
pre-apprendi
regime
overturned.
and
when
they've
finished
with
that
agenda,
maybe
they'll
turn
to
trying
to
get
different
proceedings
at
trial.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
as
cases
like
this
reveal,
there's
been
an
effort
to
expand
apprendi
to
what
could
be
viewed
as
its
widest
logical
implications,
because
although
i've
presented
a
theory
for
why
apprendi
should
be
read
narrowly
to
avoid
disrupting
the
traditional
ability
of
legislatures
to
structure
sentencing,
there
is
obviously
within
the
opinion
the
seeds
of
a
much
more
fundamental
change
in
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
true
for
a
defendant
like
the
defendant
in
jones
who
was
convicted
by
the
jury
of
a
crime
that
carried
a
15-year
penalty.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
government
could
do
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
states
have
a
much
wider
range
of
mandatory
minimum
sentencing
programs.
they've
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
that
itemizes
the
far
greater
number
and
wider
range
of
state
mandatory
minimum
programs.
i'm
not
in
a
position--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
the
states
will
suffer
increased
practical
problems
compared
to
the
federal
government
because
in
the
federal
government,
the
mandatory
minimums
are
in
relatively
specific
areas
and
we
could,
indeed,
go
forward
and
charge
and
prove
them
to
a
jury.
the
more
fundamental
implication
of
an
extension
of
apprendi
within
the
maximum
term
is
that
it
does
raise
greater
questions
about
the
constitutionality
of
schemes
such
as
the
sentencing
guidelines.
those
are,
of
course,
not
only
on
the
federal
level
but
prevalent
throughout
the
states
as
well.
and...
and
the
process
of
drawing
lines
between
whether
mandatory
minimums
are
mandatory
enough
to
trigger
any
constitutional
rule,
versus
sentencing
guidelines
not
being,
is
going
to
require
a
process
of
adjudication,
and
there's
no
way
to
predict
where
that
will
end
up.
it
will
largely
depend
on
how
broadly
this
court
interprets
the
rule
that
it
announced
in
apprendi
and
then
if
it
applies
it
here,
how
it
applies
it.
if
there--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--under
18
u.s.c.,
section
3553(e).
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
the
government
can
file
a
motion
for
substantial
assistance
of
the
defendant
in
the
prosecution
of
others,
and
upon
that
motion,
the
judge
can
go
below.
this
court
analyzed
that
statute
in
melendez
v.
united
states
several
years
ago,
a
case
which
i
believe
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
and,
justice
ginsburg,
i...
i
agree
with
the
suggestion
of
justice
souter
earlier
that
this
statute
is
not
identical
to
the
jones
statute
and
shouldn't
be
construed
identically
to
it.
first
and
most
fundamentally,
in
jones
and
again
unanimously
in
castillo,
the
court
commented
that
a
statute
that's
written,
as
section
924(c)
is
written,
has
the
look
of
the
creation
of
sentencing
factors
when
you
start
off
looking
at
it.
in
jones,
the
court
then
went
on
to
analyze
a
number
of
structural
features
that
suggested
that
the
initial
look
was
unreliable.
here
the
initial
look
is
reliable.
unlike
in
jones
where
the
additional
factors,
serious
bodily
injury
and
death,
took
the
penalty
from
15
years,
first
to
25
years,
and
then
to
life
in
prison,
here
the
initial
range
of
the
statute
is
5
years
to
life,
and
the
mandatory
minimums
are
fairly
modest
incremental
increases
in
the
minimum
sentence
of
5
years
and
7
years.
but
most
importantly,
what
is
different
from
the
statute
in
jones,
the
carjacking
statute
and
the
statute
here,
section
924(c),
is
in
jones
the
carjacking
statute
was
modeled
on
three
federal
robbery
statutes.
two
of
those
federal
robbery
statutes
contained
serious
bodily
injury
or
putting
somebody
in
jeopardy
of
serious
bodily
injury
that
were
clearly
offense
elements,
and
the
court
commented
that
it
could
see
no
reason...
and
the
government
was
unable
to
adduce
a
reason...
why
congress
would
have
departed
from
the
explicit
models
on
which
it
relied
in
drafting
the
carjacking
statute.
so
you
had
a
firmer
basis
for
concluding
in
the
carjacking
statute
that
congress
probably
intended
an
element.
here
not
only
do
you
not
have
that
feature,
because
there
was
no
federal
antecedent
for
section
924(c),
but
you
have
the
very
important
consideration
that
there's
no
constitutional
doubt
that
should
be
applied
to
the
construction
of
section
924(c).
unlike
in
jones
where
the
court
held
that
a
series
of
cases
over
25
years
had
raised
constitutional
questions
about
increasing
the
maximum,
here
the
relevant
precedent,
of
which
congress
is
presumed
to
be
aware,
is
mcmillan
v.
pennsylvania
which
gave
the
legislature
fair
warning
that
it
could
provide
for
the
kind
of
statute
that
it's
provided
here.
and
for
those
reasons,
we
think
that
the
fourth
circuit
and
every
other
court
of
appeals
that's
analyzed
the
question
is
correct
in
concluding
that
congress's
approach
in
section
924(c)
was
a
sentencing
factor
approach.
the
question
then
becomes
whether
that
is
a
constitutional
approach.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
stevens.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
history
of
sentencing
in
this
country
moved
from
early
statutes
which
were
wholly
determinate.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
then
in
the
19th
century,
the
legislatures
and
congress
and
the
state
adopted
a...
a
policy
of
having
wide
ranges
and
judicial
discretion
within
them.
then
later,
legislatures
moved
to
a
system
of
parole
boards
and...
and
indeterminate
sentencing
in
many
states.
and
it
was
as
a
result
of
those
processes
that
in
the
mid-20th
century
and
late
20th
century,
a
variety
of
commentators
began
to
decide
that
this
sentencing
scheme
that
gives
so
much
discretion
to
various
actors
in
the
system
was
not
acceptable
because
it
produced
unwarranted
disparities
against
similarly
situated
offenders.
and
at
that
point,
to
promote
transparency,
meaning
we
know
what...
why
the
judge
is
doing
what
he's
doing,
and
uniformity,
namely,
similar
offenders
will
get
the
same
sentence,
schemes
came
along
like
mandatory
minimums
and
guideline
sentencing.
but
i
believe
that
they
were
understood
to
be
directions
to
limit
judicial
discretion,
not
to
wholly
supplant
it
or
to
be
the
type
of
statute
that
the
court
invalidated
in
apprendi.
and
it's
really
the
petitioner's
burden
in
this
case
to
show
that
these
sentencing
innovations
are
unconstitutional.
in
apprendi,
the
defendant
was
able
to
carry
that
burden
by
pointing
to
a
long
line
of
consistent
judicial
decisions.
here
neither
party
can
point
to
a
long
line
of
consistent
decisions.
what
each
of
us
does
is
argue
from
the
background
baseline
tradition.
our
submission
is
that
judges
have
always
had
a
wide
range
of
discretion.
defendants
have
never
been
able
to
rely
on
not
getting
a
stiffer
sentence
within
the
maximum
authorized
ranges.
legislatures
have
relied
on
this
court's
decision
in
mcmillan,
saying
that
it's
constitutional
for
the
legislature
to
structure
that
discretion,
and
we
believe
that
the
court
should
adhere
to
that
position
today.
thank
you.
