justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
you're
saying
is
he
has
to
be
honest
when
he
decides
the
brandishing
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
on...
on
a
different
topic?
because
i
think
we
understand
your
argument
here
and
i...
justice
o'connor
asked
your
opponent,
in
essence,
to
what
extent
he
thought
the
sentencing
guidelines
were
implicated
by
this
case.
would
you
comment
on
that
subject?
tell
us
what
you
think
the
impact
of
this
decision
will
have
on
the
sentencing
guidelines.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
i
understand,
but
at
least
the...
at
least
the
argument
that
your
opponent
made
would
be
available
to
the
government.
there's
a
difference
because
of
the
amount
of
discretion--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--under
the
guideline.
i
did
not
understand.
i
want
to
be
sure
i
don't
miss
this
point
that
you
made
in
your
answer.
do
you
argue
that
in
this
case
it's
really
not
a
mandatory
minimum
because
there
is
the
discretion
in...
in
the
prosecutor
to
ask
for...
for
a
deviation
from
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
a
short...
so
i
don't
lose
the
point?
in
our
discussion
a
little
earlier,
you
mentioned
a
statute
that
makes
the
mandatory
minimum
not
100
percent
mandatory
because
the
government
may
ask
for
a...
a
departure.
what
is
the
statutory
authority
for
the
government
to
make
such
a
motion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
another...
another
question
about
the
history
and
the
length
of
the
history?
i
particularly
have
in
mind
justice
thomas's
concurring
opinion
in
apprendi.
other
than
the
mcmillan
case
itself,
are
you
aware
of
any
long
line
of
cases
prior
to
mcmillan
reaching
the
same
result?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
