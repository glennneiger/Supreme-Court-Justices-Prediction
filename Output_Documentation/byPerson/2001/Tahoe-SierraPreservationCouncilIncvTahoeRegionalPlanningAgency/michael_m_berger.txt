mr.
michael
m.
berger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
three
important
things
that
should
be
kept
in
mind
while
we're
addressing
the
issue
this
morning.
first,
the
tahoe
regional
planning
agency
totally
prohibited
a
select
group
of
individual
landowners
scattered
around
lake
tahoe
from
making
any
use
whatever
of
their
land.
these
prohibitions
were
never
designed
as
the
kind
of
planning
time-out
touted
by
trpa
and
its
amici.
rather,
mr.
michael
m.
berger
they
were
amendments...
well,
what
about...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
it
does
if
it's
a
flat
prohibition
of
use,
your
honor,
mr.
michael
m.
berger
justice
o'connor,
i
do
believe
that
if
it
is
a
total
prohibition
on
use,
and
there
is
no
use
being
made
of
the
property
at
the
time,
that
it's
part
of
the
public
project
to
have
this
freeze
on
use,
and
it's
the
public
that
ought
to
be
paying
for
that
project,
not
the
individual
landowners
who
are
frozen
out.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
think
if
they
t-
if
they
forbid
the
entire
use
of
the
property
and
don't
allow
any
applications
for
use
to
be
made,
don't
allow...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i-
if
there
is
some
reasonable,
economically
viable,
productive
use
that
can
be
made
of
the
property
at
the
time,
then
i
don't
believe
we
have
a
per
se
taking.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
it
has,
i
believe,
become
much
more
rare
these
days.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that's
correct,
justice...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
think
that's
the
more
typical
kind
of
moratorium,
and
the
kind
that
most
of
the
amici
on
the
a-
agency's
side
have
been
talking
about.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
there
was
one,
your
honor,
and
i
would
submit
that
that
court
erred.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
and
we
believe
that
that
that
simply
is
not
an
appropriate
precedent
for
this
court...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
because
it's
not
the
diminution
in
value
that
we're
talking
about
here,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
chief
justice,
i
couldn't
agree
with
that
more,
and
i
believe
that
that
is
in
fact
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that's
true,
justice
souter,
but
frankly
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
them,
because...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
absolutely
true,
but
th-
this
court's
jurisprudence
has
always
examined
cases
like
this
from
the
impact
on
the
property
owner,
not
from
what
the
the
government
gains
by
the
taking.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
justice
souter,
i
believe
that
that
distinction
gets
recognized
at
the
valuation
phase,
not
at
the
liability
phase.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
actually,
your
cases
in
in
in
quite
a
number
of
different
circumstances
say
that
if
you
do
take
one
important
stick
out
of
the
bundle,
you
may
have
well
have
taken
the...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
except
in
first
english,
your
honor,
where
this
court
expressly
said,
and
it
examined
all
the
cases,
that
temporary
takings
are
constitutionally
no
different
than
permanent...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
well,
that's
correct,
and
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
deprivation
of
all
use.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
i
agree
with
that
completely,
but
i
think
that
that
what
we're
dealing
with,
if
if
you
examine
the
facts
of
the
case,
is
that
from
the
time
that
these
ordinances
were
enacted
in
nineteen
eighty-one
until
whatever
end
point
you
want
to
look
at,
there
was
a
total
deprivation
of
use.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
present
a
penn
central...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
well,
th-
there
there
was
this
three
year
period
chopped
out
at
the
beginning
of
the...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that
appears
to
be
what
the
court
is
interested
in,
as
the
court
reframed
the
question.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
if
there
is
a
total
prohibition
of
use...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
there
is
liability.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
your
honor,
the
this
court
and
other
courts
have
always
dealt
with
the
the
time
value
of
property,
if
i
may,
differently
than
they
have
in
in
these
spatial
terms.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
condemned,
all
of
them
would
be
entitled
to
compensation.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
and
this
court
has
said
in
first
english
that
there
is
no
difference
constitutionally,
justice
stevens,
between
the
physical
takings
and
the
regulatory...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
justice...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
clearly
you
you
cannot
do
anything
until
you've
gotten
the
property
approved,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
a
landowner
working
through
a
system
whose
end
product
is,
at
least
theoretically
and
and
probably
very
likely,
the
issuance
of
a
permit
to
go
ahead
and
develop
something
that
is
economically
productive
on
that
land
as
opposed
to...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
o'connor,
mr.
michael
m.
berger
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes,
your
honor,
but
you
are
not
totally
deprived
of
the
use
of
it.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
because
you
are
there
in
a
process
working
toward
the
actual
development
of
the
process,
of
the
property,
pardon
me,
in
contrast
to
being
in
a
situation
like
these
people
are,
where
there
is
no
process
for
development.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
b-
the
the
difference
is
that
in
the
second
situation
there
is
a
conscious
and
total
prohibition
on
use,
and
that's
the
purpose
of
the
regulation,
is
to
prohibit
the
use.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
if
they
are
in
a
process
where
where
there
will
be
development
at
the
end,
then
i
believe
that
there
is
not
an
automatic
per
se
taking,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we're
dealing
with,
if
we've
got
a
total
use
prohibition,
we
do
have
a
taking.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
well,
if
i
made
it
sound
that
way,
justice
stevens,
i
i
apologize.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
sometimes
they
may.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
but
that
is
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
we
have
no
question
about
their
ability
to
protect
the
lake.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
oh,
i
don't
think
it
needs
to.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
exactly,
chief...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
justice
scalia,
in
a
sense
that
is
certainly
true,
but
in
the
case
of
the
the
processing
of
a
permit
application,
we
know
that
there
is
permitted
use.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
the
the
regulations
of
the
agency
say
that
for
this
property
there
is
permitted
use.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
don't
think
at
that
point,
your
honor,
mr.
michael
m.
berger
no,
i
think
that
in
that
case,
your
honor,
you
would
at
least
be
en-
entitled
to
perhaps
some
nuisance
examination.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
your
honor,
i
think
we
all
have
to
live
with
what
this
court
called
the
nuisance
exception
when
it
decided
the
lucas
case,
and
that
there
are
some
things
that
the
government
can
do
that
prohibit
all
use
that
are
not
compensable.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
think
i
could
accept...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
oh,
i
would
i
would
disagree
with
that
characterization.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
your
honor,
if
if
they
had
come
up
with
a
a
nuanced,
subtle
regulation
that
had
something
to
it
other
than
the
meat
ax
approach
that
the
agency
took
in
this
case,
i
think
you
would
have
a
penn
central
type
analysis,
but
what
we've
got
in
this
case
i-
is
not
anything
subtle
at
all.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
we're
twenty-two
years...
mr.
michael
m.
berger
the
clients
that
i
represent
are
still,
for
the
most
part,
unable
to
do
anything.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
believe,
justice
o'connor,
there
may
be
a
handful
of
them
that
under
the
nineteen
eighty-seven
plan,
and
the
regulations
that
came
under
that
in
nineteen
eighty-nine,
were
finally
released
and
allowed
to
do
something,
but
it's
only
a
small
number,
and
for
the
most
part
these
l-
these
properties
are
still
unused
and
unusable.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes
justice
stevens,
that's
true.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
absolutely,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
true,
and
but
what
the
court
said
in
first
english
was
that
they
were
limiting,
you
were
limiting
the
case
to
what
you
called
the
facts
presented
in
that
case,
and
the
facts
presented
in
that
case
were
a
temporary
moratorium
for
about
the
same
length
of
time
as
the
one
that
we're
dealing
with
here,
which
froze
all
use
of
that
property
and,
in
fact,
in
my
belief
had
a
better
justification
for
it,
because
it
had
a
health
and
safety
justification,
which
this
one
doesn't.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that's
correct,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
deal
with
that
question,
only
the
district
court
did,
and
its
analysis
is
there
for
you
to
look
at.
