s-
s-
suppose
that
and
then
we
have
to
play
with
the
facts
a
little
bit,
i-
it's
a
hypothetical
case,
but
that
within
a
month
from
now
the
world
trade
center
is
ready
to
be
constructed
and
new
york
says
and
the
owner
wants
to
rebuild
highrises
for
office
only,
and
the
city
says,
wait
a
minute,
this
is
so
important
to
the
whole
city,
we
need
a
year
to
think
about
it,
a
year
in
addition
to
the
usual
zoning
process.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
i
guess
my
my
my
my
question
and
i
know
you
had
a
a
more
general
introduction
that
we're
interrupting,
i-
is
is
the
use
of
a
moratorium
a
st-
a
standard
instrument
of
zoning
policy,
or
is
it
very
rare?
i
i
couldn't
find
anything
in
the
briefs
on
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
can
we
get
back
to
the
basic
question
that
justice
scalia
asked,
and
and
justice
o'connor
asked
it
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assume
that
the
tahoe
regional
planning
agency
s-
thought,
in
good
faith,
that
there
would
be
some
development
allowed,
but
they
needed
a
year
to
think
about
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
change
your
answer
about
the
world
trade
center
hypothetical,
they
say
wh-
there's
going
to
be
a
very
valuable
use,
we
just
don't
know
what
it
is,
but
we
need
a
year
to
think
about
it,
in
addition
to
the
normal
zo-
and
you
told
me
that
that
was
a
taking,
but
now
your
rationale
seems
to
me
to
back
away
from
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
calculation,
and
that's
the
penn
central
aspect
rather
than
the
more
categorical
approach
that
you're
urging
upon
us,
i
should
think.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
in
this
case
that
one
of
these
lot
owners
leased
the
property
to
someone
who's
going
to
put
a
mobile
home
on
it
for
a
year,
the
moratorium
comes
in
effect,
w-
assume
the
mobile
home
can't
be
used,
is
that
a
taking
of
the
leasehold,
of
the
of
the
of
the
of
the
lessee's...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
taking
it
from
the
lessee?
that's
all
he's
got.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
it
applies
to
a
mobile
home
and
the
guy
leases
for
the
the
lot
for
a
year,
and
that
and
trpa
says
you
you
can't
put
the
mobile
home
on
there
for
a
year.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
still
not
sure
of
your
your
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
make
it
clear,
in
my
hypothetical,
i
know
it
didn't
happen,
but
in
my
hypothetical,
no
recovery
because?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
ask
you
i
see
you're
wha-
wha-
if
if
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
just
simply
affirmed
as
is,
i-
weren't
we
wasting
our
time
in
first
english?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ye-
yes,
but
u-
u-
i-
as
a-
a-
assume
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
the
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
j-
j-
just
talk
about
a
federal
law.
