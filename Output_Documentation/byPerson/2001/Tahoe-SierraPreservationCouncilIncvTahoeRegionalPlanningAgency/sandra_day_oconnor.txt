a
temporary
order
that
says,
gee,
we're
required
by
state
law
to
develop
a
plan
and
it's
going
to
take
us
a
few
months
and,
pending
that,
you
can't
develop?
now,
i-
does
that
invoke
immediately
some
um
per
se
taking
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
says,
while
we're
developing
this
plan,
which
we
think
won't
take
long,
you
can't
go
ahead
with
your
development?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
berger,
you
may
well
have
been
able
to
prevail
under
the
penn
central
approach,
i
assume,
viewed
in
its
entirety
over
this
period
of
time,
but
that
was
waived.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
pure
and
simple
per
se
taking,
as
applied
to,
as
it
comes
to
us,
what
is
it,
a
three
year
period?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
here
as
the
case
actually
comes
to
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mhm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
interval
of
time
it
meets
your
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sounds
like.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
your
basic
zoning
law?
i'm
going
to,
as
a
city,
limit
the
use
of
this
property
to
one
house
per
acre.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
you're
permanently
deprived
of
the
use
of
it
for
commercial
purposes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
your
theory
it
would
seem
that
i-
it
suppose
that
a
building
i-
catches
fire
and
is
substantially
destroyed
by
fire,
and
the
fire
department
comes,
and
the
police
department,
and
they
block
it
off
for
a
period
of
time,
no
use
while
this
is
investigated,
none,
property
owner
can
do
nothing,
can't
enter
it,
you're
out
of
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
within
your
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
status
today?
what
is
it,
twenty-two
years
later?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
the
status
today
of
the
properties
affected
by
this
suit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
your
position
that
all
of
the
properties
involved
in
this
petition
are,
today,
still
totally
deprived
of
any
use
whatever?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
position
that
the
application
of
the
penn
central
approach
would
not
result
in
appropriate
compensation
determinations
at
the
end
of
the
day?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
light
of
what's
happened,
we
know
it's
been
twenty-two
years,
and
presumably
i-
many
of
these
properties
will
never
be
allowed
to
be
developed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
no
end
in
sight?
i-
i-
can
we
not
look
at
it
as
a
taking?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
found
there
was
a
total
deprivation
of
use
for
x
amount
of
time.
