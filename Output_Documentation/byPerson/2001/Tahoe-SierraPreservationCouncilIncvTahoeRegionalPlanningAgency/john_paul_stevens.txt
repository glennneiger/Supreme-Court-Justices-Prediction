may

ask
you
this
question,
mr.
berger?
just
looking
at
temporary
takings,
and
just
looking
at
the
liability
stage
as
opposed
to
the
the
valuation
stage,
is
there
a
distinction
in
your
view
between
a
regulatory
taking
and
a
physical
taking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
in
if
your
view
course,
the
physical
taking,
even
for
ten
minutes,
would
be
a
taking
and
there's
no
doubt
about
that.

justice
john

the
temporary
taking
i-
is
whether
the
temporary
interference
is
a
taking
or
not
depends
on
what's
going
to
happen
after
the
temporary
period
expires,
because
in
one
situation
you
think,
well,
they
know
they're
going
to
get
something
valua-
out
of
it,
in
the
other
they
don't,
but
that
that
means
that
the
test
for
the
temporary
period
turns
entirely
on
an
evaluation
of
the
future.

they're
doing
it
just
for

of
blocking

some

in

here?
justice

but
your
your
p-
you
rest
on
the
hypothesis
that
they
are
just
interested
in
a
total
blockage
for
a
temporary
period
of
time,
they

care
what

the

whether

one
question?
with

to
those
who
have
subsequently
been

to

it's
your

that
you're
nevertheless
entitled
to
a

compensation
for
the
period
in
which
the
moratorium
was
in

in

justice

may
i
ask,
di-
as
do
you
understand
your
opponent
to
be
arguing
that
a
curfew
would
be
a

justice
john

i
remember
th-
in
in
honolulu
during
the
war
you
couldn't
go
out
after
certain
hours
of

and
so
the

was
totally
useless
from
when
when
the
curfew
would
that
be
a

justice
john

so
it
would
be.
justice

this
case
comes
to
us
on
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
petitioners
own
a
number
of
vacant
lots
located
in
an
environmentally
sensitive
areas
in
the
vicinity
of
lake
tahoe.
the
lake
on
the
border
between
nevada
and
california
that
is
famous
for
its
exceptional
beauty.
petitioners
alleged
that
their
property
was
taken
without
just
compensation
in
violation
of
the
takings
caluse
of
the
federal
constitution,
when
the
tahoe
regional
planning
agency
which
we
refer
to
as
trpa
imposed
a
moratorium
on
development
of
certain
areas
that
include
their
land.
in
the
1960’s
the
clarity
of
the
water
in
the
lake
began
to
deteriorate
rapidly
as
construction
in
the
area
increased.
at
that
time
the
states
of
california
and
nevada
five
counties,
several
municipalities
and
the
forest
service
of
the
federal
government
shared
jurisdiction
over
the
tahoe
basin
which
occupies
501
square
miles.
in
1968
the
legislatures
of
the
two
states
adopted
the
tahoe
regional
planning
compact
which
congress
approved
the
next
year.
the
compact
set
goals
for
the
protection
and
preservation
of
the
lake
and
created
trpa
as
the
agency
assigned
to
coordinate
and
regulate
development
on
the
basin
and
to
conserve
its
natural
resources.
while
trpa
was
in
the
process
of
devising
a
comprehensive
land
use
plan,
it
imposed
two
moratoria
to
halt
any
construction
that
might
be
inconsistent
with
its
ultimate
plan.
together
these
two
moratoria
effectively
prohibited
any
development
at
all
on
the
petitioners
land
for
32
months.
the
district
court
found
that
trpa
had
not
affected
a
partial
taking
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis
set
out
in
our
opinion
in
penn
central
transportation
company
againts
new
york
city.
nevertheless,
it
concluded
that
the
moratoria
did
constitute
a
taking
under
the
categorical
rule
announced
in
lucas
againts
south
carolina
coastal
council,
because
they
deprived
petitioners
of
all
economically
viable
use
of
their
land
while
they
were
in
effect.
on
appeal,
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
and
held
that
lucas
applies
only
to
the
relatively
rare
case
in
which
a
regulation
permanently
denies
the
owner
all
productive
use
of
an
entire
parcel.
it
reasoned
that
because
the
moratoria
had
only
a
temporary
impact
on
the
petitioner's
fee
interest,
no
categorial
taking
had
occured.
we
granted
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
text
of
the
of
the
fifth
amendment
provides
a
basis
for
drawing
a
distinction
between
physical
takings
and
regulatory
takings.
its
plain
language
requires
compensation
whenever
the
government
condemns
or
appropriates
private
property
for
a
public
purpose.
but
the
inquiry
is
more
complex
when
it
is
alleged
that
a
regulation
prohibiting
certain
uses
of
property
is
so
harsh
that
it
should
be
viewed
as
a
taking.
although
this
court's
physical
taking
is
jurisprudent
and
involves
a
straightforward
application
of
categorical
rules.
our
regulatory
taking
jurisprudence
is
characterized
by
essentially
ad
hoc
factual
inquiries.
the
longstanding
distinction
between
physical
takings
and
regulatory
takings
makes
it
inappropriate
to
treat
precedent
from
one
group
of
cases
as
controlling
in
the
other.
petitioner's
argue
that
our
decisions
in
first
english
of
evangelical
lutheran
church
of
glendale
against
the
county
of
los
angeles
and
lucas,
both
regulatory
takings
cases
adapted
a
categorical
rule
that
whenever
the
government
imposes
a
deprivation
of
all
economically
viable
use
of
property
no
matter
how
brief
it
affects
the
taking.
in
first
english
however
we
decided
that
compensation
is
an
appropriate
remedy
for
a
regulatory
taking
but
we
did
not
address
the
logically
prior
question
whether
the
temporary
regulation
was
in
fact
a
taking.
to
the
extent
that
we
reference
that
anteceding
question,
first
english
recognized
that
normal
delays
in
obtaining
building
permits
changes
in
zoning
ordinances
variances
and
the
like
but
not
constitute
takings.
nor
is
lucas
dispositive
of
the
question
presented
to
us
today.
its
categorical
rule
requiring
compensation
when
a
regulation
permanently
deprives
an
owner
of
all
economically
beneficial
uses
of
her
land
does
not
answer
the
question
whether
a
regulation
prohibiting
economic
use
of
the
land
for
32
months
must
be
compensated.
the
petitioner's
attempt
to
bring
this
case
under
the
rule
in
lucas
by
focusing
exclusively
on
the
property
during
the
moratoria
ignorea
the
court's
admonition
in
penn
central
to
focus
on
the
impact
of
the
regulation
on
the
parcel
as
a
whole.
interest
in
real
property
have
a
temporal
dimension
as
well
as
legal
and
physical
dimensions.
while
we
reject
petitioner's
argument
that
their
proposed
per
se
rule
is
dictated
by
precedent.
we
nevertheless
consider
whether
the
interest
in
protecting
property
owners
from
bearing
burdens
which
in
all
fairness
and
justice
should
be
born
by
the
public
as
a
whole
justifies
the
crafting
of
a
new
categorical
rule.
we
conclude
however
that
the
fairness
in
justice
will
not
always
be
served
by
a
rule
that
any
deprivation
of
all
economic
use
no
matter
how
brief
constitutes
a
compensable
taking.
such
a
rule
would
require
changes
in
numerous
practices
that
have
been
long
been
considered
permissible
exercises
of
the
police
power.
moreover
section
important
changes
in
the
law
should
be

and
