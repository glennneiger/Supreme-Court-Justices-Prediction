can
you
can
you
reconcile
the
different
approach
that
this
court
has
said
goes
for
spatial
segre-
separation,
like
the
air
space
in
penn
central,
and
time
segregation?
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
one
if
penn
central
is
the
regime
for
splitting
off
the
air
rights,
it
should
also
be
the
regime
for
splitting
off
a
a
discrete
period
of
time.

when
you
say
sold,
do
you
mean
the
bar-
at
the
bargain
price
that
mr.
berger
referred
to,
sold
to
to...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
the
district
court
said
there
wasn't
that
a
nuisance
hadn't
been
made
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
from
first
english,
stating
the
holding.
justice

was
not
resolved
on
on
on
appeal.
