mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners'
only
takings
claim
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
his
only
their
only
takings
claim
before
this
court
is
a
facial
per
se
claim.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i-
on
the
facial
aspect
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
court
said
that
lucas
applied
only
in
the
rare
circumstance,
of
a
total
ban
on
economically
productive
use.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ye-
yeah...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
interest
and
to
so
that
it
corresponds
to
the
extent
of
the
regulation...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
n-
the
the
the
right
at
issue
here
is
the
right
to
build
residences,
to
develop...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
un-
i-
it
would
it
would
first
of
all
be
under
the
penn
central
analysis,
and
the
economic...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
b-
but
the
the
other
th-
the
distinction
is
is
one
the
one
this
court
talked
about
in
loretto,
between
i-
you
mentioned
the
world
war
two
condemnation
cases.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i-
b-
because
you're
you're
starting
out
with
a
property
presumably
the
regulation
applies
to
the
property
generally,
and
it
just
so
happens
that
this
one
parcel
is
been
s-
been
severed
out
into
a
leasehold,
and
i-
in
doing
that,
tha-
i-
th-
i-
yo-
that
is
a
qu-
qu-
question
that
has
to
be
addressed
before
you
get
to
the
ana-
analysis,
should
you
sever
out
the
affected
property
interest...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
the
if
this
court
is
in
its
past
takings
cases,
when
it's
been
presented
with
a
regulation
that
applies
to
a
discrete
property
interest,
it
hasn't
said,
well,
let's
redefine
the
effective
property
interests
to
that.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
i'm
not
sure
it's
no
recovery,
but
i
i
am
sure
that
it's
still
evaluated
under
penn
central...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
impact
of
regulation
would
have
been
something
that
would
be
addressed
in
the
in
the
lease
agreement
itself.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they're
leasing
it
to
to
build
a
mobile
home,
it
turns
out
they
can't,
wh-
who
bears
the
responsibility
for
that,
again
m-
matter
between
the
lessor
and
the
lessee.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
fir-
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
first,
your
honor,
my
understanding
of
the
record
is
quite
different
from
my
brother's.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sold
to
typically
to
the
government
buy-out
agencies,
i
wouldn't
say
at
a
bargain
price.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
here.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
if...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
first
thing
i'd
say
is,
you
bring
an
as-applied
claim
and
not
a
facial
claim.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as-applied
challenge
is
to
the
temporary
moratorium?
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
go
through
the
penn
central
factors,
and
if
it's
taking
too
long,
that's
certainly
something
pertinent
on
the
character
of
the
government
action.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that
they
would
have
to
show.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
[inaudible]
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
other
factors
include
the
impact
on
the
property.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
even
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
the
moratorium
is
long
enough
so
that
the
present
value
of
the
uses
that
might
be
allowed
is
de
minimis,
then
perhaps
the
categorical
rule
would
apply,
and
ten
years
seems
like
it's
going
to
be
too
long
for
the
government
to
figure
out
and
carry
out
its
responsibilities
and
planning,
but
i
wouldn't
say
that
we
try
to
find
a
point
at
time
i-
at
which
suddenly
we
shift
from
the
accepted
penn
central
analysis
to
the
lucas...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
i'm
saying
is
at
some
point
calling
something
a
temporary
moratorium
is
a
misuse
of
the
label.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
like
the
petitioners'
effort
to
link
their
lost
challenges
to
the
permanent
land
use
plan
to
their
challenge
to
the
temporary
moratorium.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
going
to
say
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
specifically
found
that
the
agency
acted
in
good
faith
throughout,
so
the
idea
that
the
temporary
moratorium
to
allow
planning
to
take
place
was
some
kind
of
a
sham
for
a
permanent
rol-
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
only
looked
at
from
that
period.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
raised
the
claim
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
one
reason
there
was
no
taking,
even
if
lucas
applied,
was
because
of
the
nuisance
exception.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
that's
right,
and
we
appealed
that,
and
the
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
find...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
given
the
impact
on
the
lake
of
development,
that
it
fell
within
the
california
and
nevada
nuisance
requirements.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
that
it
should
all
be
a
park,
but
that
further
development
would
threaten
serious
and,
in
fact,
irreparable
harm
to
the
lake.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
first
of
all
they
waited
until
the
eighty-four
plan
took
effect
to
file
their
lawsuit.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no
the...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
period
in
which
the
agency's
justification
is,
we
need
a
time-out
to
undertake
planning
so
that
we're
not
locking
the
barn
door
after
the
horse
escapes,
should
be
evaluated
separately
from
the
period
in
which
the
agency
says,
this
is
the
land
use
plan,
and
if
you've
got
a
gripe
with
us
you
can
challenge
that.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
certainly,
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
district
court
at
petition
appendix
page
sixty-nine
said
the
agency
acted
in
complete
good
faith,
and
completed
its
responsibilities
as
sw-
as
quickly
as
could
be
expected.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
that's
what
the
california
state
courts
determined
on
remand
when
they
were...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no,
no,
i-
not
at
all.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank...
