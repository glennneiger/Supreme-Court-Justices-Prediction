wh-
i-
wh-
my
impression
is
that
that
most
of
these
mora-
moratoriums,
or
moratoria,
whatever
they're
called,
would
not
would
not
be
total.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
what
do
you
do
about
the
fact
that
there
is
a
a
regulatory
taking
of
of
sorts
whenever
you
have
a
permit
system,
let's
say
the
normal
zoning
regime
in
which
you
cannot
construct
any
any
building
on
on
your
on
your
acreage
without
first
applying
and
getting
and
getting
the
approval
of
the
of
the
zoning
agency?
justice
antonin
scalia
period,
there
has
been
a
total
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
in
in
the
one
case
the
the
regulating
agency
has
said,
you
can't
do
anything
with
your
land
while
we're
thinking
about
the
scheme
we're
going
to
adopt,
and
in
the
other
case
the
agency
has
said,
just
as
categorically,
you
can't
do
anything
with
your
land
while
we
consider
your
application.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
not
d-
not
during
the
pendency.
justice
antonin
scalia
application
is
pending.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
do
a
penn
central
you
could've
done
penn
central
in
lucas.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
take
a
three
year
i
take
a
three
year
leasehold,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
do
a
penn
central
analysis
of...
justice
antonin
scalia
sold
to
the
government
agencies
who
will
do
with
it
just
exactly
what
is
achieved
by
the
government's
not
taking
possession
of
it,
that
is,
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
wants
to
assure
that
the
land
lies
fallow.
justice
antonin
scalia
applied
challenge
go?
what
what
if
you
if
you
make
an
as-applied
challenge.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
goes
beyond
penn
central
if
you're
no
if
it
is
no
longer
an
honest
moratorium
to
decide
what
you're
what
you're
going
to
do
with
the
land,
then
you're
out
of
penn
central.
justice
antonin
scalia
years
is
just
is
is
just
prohibiting
me
from
using
my
land
with
no
other
governmental
purpose
in
mind
except
the
prohibition.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
justice
antonin
scalia
you
acknowledge
that
that
that
if,
in
an
as-applied
challenge,
there's
a
showing
that
the
agency
does
not
need
three
years
or
five
years
or
whatever,
that
the
thing
could
reasonably
have
been
done
in
one
year,
everything
beyond
the
one
year
is
then
a
taking?
justice
antonin
scalia
depends
on
on
how
on
how
much
any
prospective
buyer
would
believe
that
the
temporary
ban
is
really
temporary,
justice
antonin
scalia
they
believe
that
it's
going
to
be
strung
out
and
extended,
and
and
if
worst
comes
to
worse,
and
the
government
can't
pick
it
up
at
at
bargain
prices
it
will
pay
compensation
and
and
and
to
get
rid
of
the
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
do
do
you
agree
that
a
a
temporary
moratorium
that
ripens
into
a
permanent
ban
is
a
taking?
i
mean,
you
know,
let's
let's
assume
that
i
sold
i
sold
the
property
during
the
temporary
moratorium
which
later
ripens
into
a
total
ban,
justice
antonin
scalia
and
and
and
i
i
claim
that
i
should
have
been
compensated
for
those
three
years
that
i
owned
the
property
without
any
inabi-
a-
any
ability
to
do
it
to
it
does
that...
justice
antonin
scalia
constitute
a
taking?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
a
time
out,
nobody
does
anything
with
this
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
two
cases,
as
i
recall,
that
that
involved
two...
justice
antonin
scalia
because
they
couldn't
use
their
property
at
all
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
fine,
and
that's
a
general
social
problem
for
which
the
entire
society
should
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
you
do
need
that
time
to
figure
out
what
to
do
with
the
lake,
why
should
some
individuals
bear
the
burden
of
that
necessary
pause
to
consider
what
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
that,
but
these
aren't
the
only
people
who
are
using
lake
tahoe.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
saying,
since
we
need
time
to
think
about
this,
we
are
preventing
total,
total,
all
the
use
of
of
your
land
for
three
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
i
don't
see
that
it
it
seems
to
me
fair
that
that
these
people
should
bear
the
whole
brunt
of
th-
of
of
the
mora-
justice
antonin
scalia
i
i
agree
with
that,
and
that's...
