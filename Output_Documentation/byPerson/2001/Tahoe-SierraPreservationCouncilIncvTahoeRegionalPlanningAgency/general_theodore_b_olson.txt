mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
colloquy
so
far
today
seems
to
me
to
illustrate
the
wisdom
of
justice
o'connor's
comment
in
her
concurring
opinion
in
palazzolo
case
last
last
june
that
the
court
should
avoid
per
se
rules
in
the
area
of
regulatory
takings.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
very
difficult
distinction
for
him
to
make,
because
it
requires
an
analysis
of
the
nature
of
the
government's
interest
in
each
particular
permitting
process.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
wh-
what
we
would
submit
is
that
the
that
zoning
permitting
process
is
part
of
the
background
principles
of
land
use,
and
land
regulation,
just
as
temporary
moratoria
h-
have
always
been,
that
that
when
there's
a
rezoning
process,
a
process
referred
to
in
the
f-
by
this
court
in
the
first
english
case,
that
process
may
have
to
come
to
a
halt.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
it
it
may
be
unusual,
but
it
is
not
so
rare.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
first
one
that
they
refer
to
is
they
aid
the
preparation
of
a
comprehensive
plan
by
precluding
developers
from
obtaining
permits
that
conflict
with
the
plan
being
drafted.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
they
couldn't
use
their
property
at
all
as
far
as
this
case
was
concerned,
and
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
for
a
limited
period
of
time
while
a
government
agency
was
acting
to
address
the
problem
that
they
acknowledge,
because
they
acknowledge
that
continued
development
along
the
lines
that
was
occurring
at
the
time
this
moratorium
was
adopted
was
degrading
the
lake
and
destroying
their...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
it's
it's
i
submit
it's
the
teaching
of
this
court
that
not
every
delay,
not
every
intrusion
on
the
use
of
property,
not
every
incursion
on
property
rights
constitutes
a
taking
under
the
fifth...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
they
haven't
established
that
they
have
i-
bore
the
whole
brunt.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
because
i-
if
the
use
of
that
property,
as
they
acknowledge,
would
have
destroyed
the
very
property
rights
that
they
were
they're
here
seeking
to
vindicate,
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
in
many
different
situations
the
government
might
have
lots
of
reasons,
local
governments,
state
governments,
federal
governments,
to
cause
a
pause
in
the
development.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
right...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
why
this
court
in
the
penn
central
case
gave
an
opportunity
to
use
a
reasoned
decisionmaking
to
solve
the
problem,
to
find
out
how
far
is
too
far.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
understand
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
the
government
agencies
that
looked
at
this
problem
decided
that
it
had
to
be
d-
d-
d-
d-
s-
solved
in
a
global
way.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
a
taking
well,
a
curfew
a
wi-
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i'd
i'd
i
think
that
they're
arguing
that
any
momentary
suspension
of
the
use
of
property
would
be
a
taking.
