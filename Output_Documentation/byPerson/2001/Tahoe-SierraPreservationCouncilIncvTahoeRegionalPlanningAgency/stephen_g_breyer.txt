why
is
it
i
guess
this
is
going
to
be
your
basic
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
satisfied
with
the
standard
that
says,
every
government
regulation
is
a
candidate
for
a
taking,
just
as
every
speech
act
is
a
first
amendment
candidate,
but
it's
actually
a
taking
in
this
area
only
when
the
the
impact
of
the
government
regulation
is
not
part
of
a
reasonable
process
looking
towards
a
reasonable
form
of
regulated
develop-?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
going
to
say
they
win,
because
they're
going
to
say,
of
course,
this
was
an
effort,
reasonably,
to
regulate
lake
tahoe
over
a
period
of
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
prove
that?
would
he
what
about
the
one
third
who
could
never
build?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
them?
wha-
what
is
your
view
of
the
correct
thing
he
should
have
done?
is
a
person
who
never
is
allowed
to
build,
and
never
can
use
the
property
at
all,
simply
out
of
luck,
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
having
a
ten
year,
a
a
a
thirty
year
proce-
procedure
of
of
of
three
year
moratoriums,
ten
at
a
time
or
something
like
that?
h-
h-
how
is
it
supposed
to
work,
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
phrased
that
way
it's,
i-,
phrased
that
way,
it's
quite
clearly
in
your
favor,
but
i
think
they're
seeing
this
as
a
group
of
landowners
thinking
from
the
beginning,
whatever
the
justification
for
this,
and
the
justification
is
excellent,
saving
lake
tahoe,
it's
going
to
end
up
that
we
won't
be
able
to
use
our
land
for
anything,
and
we
c-
t-
been
able
to
tell
you
that
from
day
one,
so
we
brought
a
case
right
off
the
bat
because
we
knew
that
was
going
to
happen,
and
then
year
after
year
went
by
where
people
told
us,
maybe
you'll
be
able
to
build,
maybe
you
won't,
which
really
wasn't
so,
we
knew
we
wouldn't,
and
then
it
ended
up
that
we
couldn't,
all
right.
