chief

william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
one
minnesota
moratorium
that
was
seemed
somewhat
like
this
that
had
been
sustained
by,
i
think
the
minnesota
appellate
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
respondent
here
had
simply
said,
we're
g-
we're
going
to
need
your
property
for
three
years,
and
so
we're
going
to
take
a
leasehold
interest
for
three
years,
the
respondent
would
have
had
to
compensate
for
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
argument
in
effect
contrasts
that
with
an
existing
permit
system
whereby
if
you
comply
with
certain
requirements
you
will
ultimately
end
up
with
a
permit,
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
make
sure
you
do
comply
with
the
requirements.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
berger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts,
you
you
describe
it
as
a
bold
claim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
motors
certainly
didn't
do
penn
central.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could've
made
that
same
argument
in
general
motors,
and
i
think
the
government
did,
that
you
shouldn't
just
treat
it
as
a
leasehold,
you've
got
to
evaluate
the
whole
property.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wh-
wh-
what
if
l-
let's
take
a
hypothesis
where
the
moratorium
is
ten
years.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
agree
that
shift
has
to
take
place
somewhere
along
the
continuum
of...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
court
of
appeals,
that
this
was
a
nuisance
exception?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
it
all
should
be
a
park
kind
of...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
that
way,
general
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
true.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they've
certainly
established
a
common
situation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
no
one
is
challenging
their
authority
in
the
sense
of
acting
for
the
government,
but
the
fact
that
they
were
instructed
to
do
it
by
congress
doesn't
make
it
any
more
or
any
less
of
a
taking.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thirteenth
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
berger.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.

agency
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
