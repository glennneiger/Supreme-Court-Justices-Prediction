justice
david
h.
souter
well
you're
it
seems
to
me
you're
not
dealing
with
that
here,
because
in
that
hypothetical
the
person,
the
the
third
party
in
fact
takes
the
property
in
the
sense
of
using
it
for
that
party's
own
benefit.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
person
taking
in
the
one
hypothetical
gets
a
considerable
personal
value,
i
e,
the
use
of
a
car,
or
the
use
of
property
for
a
period
of
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
your
argument,
and
wasn't
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
in
effect
to
invoke
the
kind
of
standard
language
which
has
come
out
of
the
lucas
case?
in
other
words,
it
is
preventing
all
use
of
the
property,
or
all
economically
productive
use
of
the
property,
and
yet
lucas
derived
that
phrase
in
a
circumstance
in
which
the
denial
of
economic
use
was
assumed
to
be
permanent.
justice
david
h.
souter
really
saying
is,
if
the
i
think,
that
if
in
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
there
is
a
diminution
in
the
value
for
this
period
of
ten
percent,
that
you've
got
to
compensate
for
the
full
ten
percent,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
our
cases
are
pretty
clear
in
saying,
that's
not
how
you
measure
the
compensation
obligation.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
that
gets
to
the
argument
that
the
other
side
makes
throughout
here,
that
the
assumption
of
that
statement
was
that
we
had
a
taking
in
the
first
place,
whereas
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
we
do
have
a
taking
in
the
first
place.
justice
david
h.
souter
use
if
you
fit
it
into
lucas.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
in
order
to
get
into
first
eng-
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
seems
to
me
in
effect
and
maybe
this
is
a
variant
on
justice
stevens'
question
that
you're
saying,
what's
really
wrong
here
is
that
this
is
not
done
in
good
faith,
that
this
is
not
done,
let's
say,
in
in
the
in
the
case
of
the
the
period
of
time
necessary
to
get
permits,
with
with
an
actual
development
in
mind.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
evaluate
it
under
penn
central,
would
it
be
legitimate
to
evaluate
it
this
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
the
lessee
would
probably
come
out
okay
against
a
different
party.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
let's
assume
that
they
are
analyzed
separately,
and
it
is
found
that
for
the
the
period
justice
scalia
is
talking
about
the
government
really
was
not
acting
in
good
faith.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
a
it's
a
question
basically
of
good
faith
and
intent...
justice
david
h.
souter
understanding
what
they're
doing.
