gonzaga
university
versus
john
doe.
john
doe,
a
respondent
here
studied
elementary
education
at
gonzaga
university
in
spokane,
washington.
before
he
graduated,
he
learned
that
gonzaga
disclosed
false
and
defamatory
allegations
about
him
to
officials
of
the
state
of
washington.
he
sued
under
state
court
claiming
tort
and
contract
violations
under
state
law
and
appending
federal
violation
of
the
family
education
rights
and
privacy
act,
the
acronym
for
which
is
ferpa.
the
basis
for
the
ferpa
claim
was
section
1983
which
provides
a
cause
of
action
to
enforce
federal
rights
against
state
actors.
a
jury
awarded
him
not
only
compensatory
but
punitive
damages
on
both
his
state
and
federal
claims.
gonzaga
appealed.
it
argued
that
ferpa
creates
no
federal
rights
and
therefore
cannot
be
enforced.
the
washington
supreme
court
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
washington
supreme
court.
section
1983
provides
the
means
for
enforcing
individual
rights
that
are
secured
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
ferpa
confers
upon
the
respondent
an
individual
right
to
be
enforced
under
this
section.
we
find
that
it
confers
no
such
right.
we
begin
by
noting
that
our
opinions
in
this
area
suggested
inconsistent
standards
for
determining
whether
a
federal
statute
is
enforceable
by
1983.
but
we
hold
today
that
a
federal
statute
is
enforceable
by
section
1983
only
if
it
clearly
and
ambiguously
confers
right
upon
a
class
of
persons
that
includes
the
plaintiff
bringing
suit.
this
standard
is
the
same
as
that
used
to
determine
whether
a
statute
confers
with
federal
rights
in
the
context
of
suits
brought
against
private
parties
under
an
implied
right
of
action.
both
inquiries
simply
require
courts
to
determine
whether
congress
unambiguously
confer
to
federal
rights.
ferpa's
confidentiality
provisions
clearly
lack
the
sort
of
rights
creating
language
critical
to
showing
the
required
legislative
intent
to
create
new
rights.
unlike
the
anti-discrimination
provisions
of
title
vi
and
ix
which
focus
directly
on
the
individual
to
be
protected
and
thus,
confirm
individual
rights,
ferpa
merely
instructs
the
secretary
of
education
how
to
distribute
federal
funds.
the
operative
language
of
the
statute,
for
example,
says
no
fund
shall
be
made
available
to
schools
or
institutions
that
have
a
policy
of
practice
of
disclosing
private
information.
this
language
is
far
removed
from
the
sort
of
language
required
to
confer
a
new
federal
right.
accordingly,
we
hold
ferpa
provides
no
basis
for
a
private
lawsuit
brought
under
section
1983.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
souter
joins;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
joins.
