what
do
you
do
about
the
the
language
where
it
says,
no
funds
shall
be
made
available
to
a
school
that
effectively
prevents,
et
cetera,
th-
the
students
th-
ri-
giv-
it
says,
of
the
right
to
inspect.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
about
the
idea
that
this
could
be
bifurcated,
that
it
that
it
orders
a
right
to
inspect,
because
that
isn't
going
to
be
too
tough,
you
let
the
person
look
at
the
records,
but
there's
a
policy
of
disclosure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
read
the
word
policy,
what
policy?
i
think
justice
scalia
is
reading
it
as,
what
policy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
releasing
records
without
written
consent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
hm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
does
right
refer
to
b?
i
mean,
rights
could
refer
to
a.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
permission
or
consent
of
and...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
be
the
first
is
this,
and
the
other
is
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
after
he's
eighteen
is
a
right
that
goes
to
the
student,
not
to
the
parent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
ask
you
one
question
on
the
practicality?
if
assuming
all
the
language
is
ambiguous,
et
cetera,
and
i'd
like
you
to
remove
this
image
from
my
mind.
