ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
could
begin
by
responding
to
justice
kennedy's
question
about
whether
the
family
policy
compliance
office
is
overworked,
i
will
tell
you
that
they
do
work
very
hard,
but
they
do
they
handle
for
a
small
staff,
they
handle
an
amazing
amount
of
work,
and
have
been
doing
so
for
twenty-eight
years
under
this
statute.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
hmm?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes,
but
they
also
i'm
i'm
not
done
with
my
list
if
you'll
forgive
me.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that's
right
and
well
and
well
over
a
well
over
a
thousand
e-mails,
and
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
that
there
isn't
i
mean,
if
you
look
at
the
the
legal
landscape
out
there,
too,
there
hasn't
been
an
e-
enormous
volume
of
nineteen
eighty-three
actions,
and
that
is
because
the
secretary
has
been
very
successful,
i
think,
in
communicating
and
enforcing
this
in
an
informal
manner
with
the
universities.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
if
i
could
ask
answer
that
in
two
stages.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
hm.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mhm.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
again,
this
this
court
made
clear
in
pennhurst
that
you
can't
just
look
at
the
word
right
in
isolation.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
am
sorry,
i'm
having
there
were...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
it's
it's
not
for-
i've
two
answers.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mhm.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
what
the
st-
the
statute
is
creating
there
is
a
federal
overlay
to
protect
pre-
as
as
as
was
said
in
the
legislative
history
on
page
seventeen...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
congress
felt
that
when
they
said
preexisting
moral
or
legal
rights,
that
ther-
there
was
a
sense
of
congress
that
this
is
a
type
of,
n-
not
not
in
a
right
sense
that
we
use
in
for
purposes
of
nineteen
eighty-three
actions,
but
con-
the
legislative
history
was
that
congress
had
a
sense
here
that
this
was
something
all
individuals
should
have.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
i-
congress'
language
was
preexisting
moral
or
legal,
rights
and
so
i'm
i'm
not
sure
what
one
considers...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
no
it
wouldn't,
because
what
you
still
have
is,
once
you
take
these
funds
you
have
a
federal
overlay.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
then
thed-
there's
a
fed
there
is
there's
no
doubt
that
there's
a
federal
level
of
protection
here
for
privacy,
and
it
wa-
it
it's
at
a
aggregated,
collective
system-wide
level.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that
that's
right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
th-
th-
that's
right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
thank
you.
