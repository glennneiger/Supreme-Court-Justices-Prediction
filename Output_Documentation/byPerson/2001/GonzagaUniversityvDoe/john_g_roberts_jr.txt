mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
nineteen
seventy-four,
when
it
en-
enacted
the
family
educational
r-
rights
and
privacy
act,
congress
conditioned
federal
funding
for
educational
institutions
on
the
institution
not
having
a
policy
or
practice
of
releasing
student
records
without
consent.
congress
did
not
phrase
this
condition
in
terms
of
individual
rights.
it
did
not,
for
example,
follow
the
model
of
title
nine,
enacted
two
years
earlier
and
also
dealing
with
educational
institutions,
and
say
something
like,
no
student
at
a
school
receiving
federal
funds
shall
have
his
records
released
without
his
consent.
instead,
congress
proceeded
more
indirectly.
it
said
that
no
funds
shall
be
made
available
to
any
institution
having
a
policy
or
practice
of
releasing
student
records
without
consent.
the
statute
is
directed
to
the
secretary
of
education.
he's
the
one
who
makes
federal
funds
available,
not
to
the
institution
receiving
the
funds,
and
certainly
not
to
the
individual
student.
this
court's
cases
establish
that
that
is
a
distinction
that
makes
a
difference.
in
cannon,
for
example,
the
court
said
there
would
be...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
far
less
reason
--
mr.
roberts,
isn't
it...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
implied
right
of
action
question
there
are
two
questions,
did
congress
intend
to
create
a
right,
and
did
congress
intend
to
provide
a
judicial
remedy?
in
the
nineteen
eighty-three
context,
there
are
two
questions,
did
congress
intend
to
create
a
right,
and
did
congress
intend
to
preclude
resort
to
the
nineteen
eighty-three
remedy,
so
that
first
question
i
think
is
the
same
under
both
categories
of
cases,
and
as
the
court
said
in
cannon,
if
congress
phrases
the
statute
as
quo-
quote,
as
a
prohibition
on
the
disbursement
of
public
funds,
there's
far
less
reason
to
think
that
they
intended
a
private
remedy.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
of
course,
the
word
rights
does
not
appear
in
the
disclosure
provision,
subsection
b,
and
in
pennhurst,
where
the
court
was
dealing
with
the
developmentally
disabled
bill
of
rights,
the
court
explained
that
just
because
the
statute
uses
the
word
rights
doesn't
mean
that
it
creates
a
nineteen
eighty-three
right.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
first
of
all,
the
court
in
blessing
said
that
you
don't
look
at
the
whole
act.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
whatever
rights,
whether
you're
talking
e-
putting
aside
the
question
whether
it's
a
nineteen
eighty-three
right
or
a
right
to
participate
in
the
process
that's
established
under
the
statute,
it
is
part
of
the
policy
or
practice
that
the
secretary
of
education
is
to
look
to
in
deciding
whether
to
disburse
funds.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
twelve
a
of
our
statutory
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
says
to
the
secretary,
you
set
up
an
office
to
investigate,
process,
review,
and
adjudicate
complaints
about
violations
under
ferpa.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
as
evidence
that
there
might
be
a
problem
with
the
school's
policy,
and
this
is
what
makes
it
different,
for
example,
from
the
wright
case.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i-
in
terms
of
the
scope
of
liabil-
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly,
but
it
is
the
fact
that
congress
focused
on
the
policy
or
practice
that
helps
establish
that
they
were
not
concerned
with
individual
instances
of
disclosure.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
it's
very
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
distinction
behow-
between
how
matters
are
handled
before
the
family
policy
compliance
office
and
in
court.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
fact,
in
practice
most
of
what
they
do
is
field
questions
from
the
school,
how
do
we
handle
this
situation,
what
do
we
do...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
certainly
is.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
focus
of
the
office
is
in
vindicating
what
the
statute
provides.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
the
statute
is
directed
to
prospective
compliance,
not
retrospective
compensation
for
injuries.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
direct
response
is
that
you've
left
out
words
in
the
quote,
which
is
that
no
funds
shall
be
made
available
to
an
institution
that
has
a
policy
or
practice,
and
the
question
is,
is
congress
focusing
on
protecting
individual
rights
in,
as
the
court
said
in
blessing,
an
individual
way,
or
are
they
addressing
a
systemic
concern.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
not,
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
the
right
to
inspect
is
not
an
independent
and
freestanding
right.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
this
section.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
statute
doesn't
use
the
words
right
under
subsection
b.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
twelve
thirty-two
g
b
is
the
section
at
issue.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
b
is
on
six
a
and
it
does
not
refer
to
rights.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
it
is
implausible
to
suppose
that
the
same
congress
that
was
so
worried
about
multiple
interpretations
of
the
law
from
the
regional
offices
of
one
department
would
have
been
perfectly
content
and,
in
fact,
intended
to
confer
the
right
for
every
one
of
sixty-two
million
students
to
go
into
court
in
a
nineteen
eighty-three
action.
