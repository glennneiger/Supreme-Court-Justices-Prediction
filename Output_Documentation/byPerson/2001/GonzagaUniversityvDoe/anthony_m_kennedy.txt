this-
the
the
statute
does
talk
about
rights
of
students
and
rights
rights
of
parents.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
i
recognize
in
the
one
section
that
we're
talking
about
here
you
have
a
stronger
argument
than
the
other,
but
if
we
a-
assume
for
the
moment
would
have
a
nineteen
eighty-three
cause
of
action
under
the
whole
act
without
going
down
provision
by
provision,
then
i
i
do
think
you
have
to
recognize
that
w-
the
act
does
talk
about
rights
of
students,
rights
of
parents
t-
to
look
at
files,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.

i
think
it's
that
latter
rationale
that
might
be
stronger
for
your
case.

first
three
factors
listed
in
blessing,
congress
intended
that
it
benefit
the

plaintiff,
and
it
not
be

competence...
justice

must
be
a
unam-
unambiguously
binding
obligation
on
the
state,
it
would
s-
seem
to
me
that
those
are
met
here,
and
that
you
then
have
to
go
to
the
next
part
of
the
test
which
is
th-
th-
th-
that
that
creates
a
s-
presumption
that
there
is
a
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
seem
to
me
that
it
talks
of
the
student
and
the
parent...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
very
specific
terms,
and
it
uses
uses
the
term
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
roberts
used
the
word
obligation,
you
stay
away
from
the
the
term,
right,
in
the
statute.

can
be
enforced
through
a
comprehensive
administrative
scheme?
