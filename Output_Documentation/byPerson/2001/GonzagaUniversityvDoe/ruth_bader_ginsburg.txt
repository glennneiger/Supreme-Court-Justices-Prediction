well,
mr.
roberts,
why
are
they
mutually
exclusive?
i
mean,
the
the
secretary
has
this
authority,
and
i
think
your
argument
would
be
more
impressive
if
this
were
a
large
operation.

order?
i
mean
tha-
one
of
the
points
that
was
made
is
that
if
e-
records
are
about
to
be
divulged,
say,
to
a
newspaper,
and
the
student
or
the
parent
wants
an
s-
immediate
stop
order,
you
can
go
into
court
and
get
a
tro.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
emphasis,
i
mean
as
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
roberts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
stated
you
my
question
precisely.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
say
that
you
met
the
three
blessing
standards,
justice
o'connor
said
in
that
opinion,
there's
something
more,
and
that
the
more
is
what
seems
to
be
the
strongest
emphasis
of
the
case
that
mr.
roberts
and
ms.
millett
made,
and
that
is
that
congress
created
an
enforcement
scheme
that
they
meant
to
be
it,
that
would
be
incompatible
with
individual
enforcement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
may
not
be
the
ideal
remedy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
nineteen
eighty-three
really
doesn't
fit
this
pattern,
because
why
even,
why
should
certain
kinds
of
institutions
be
stopped,
and
others
not,
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
doesn't
the
student
have
the
same,
whether
we're
going
to
call
it
right
or
opportunity,
in
in
the
private
school
with
respect
to
records,
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
private
university?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
haven't
been
other
cases
where
substantial
monetary
damages
and
punitive
damages
have
been
available,
and
maybe
that's
the
concern.
