justice

scalia
you
you
say
violations
of
this
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
investigate
any
individual
complaint,
un-
unless
the
person
comes
in
and
says,
not
only
do
they
do
it
to
me,
but
this
is
their
policy,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
that
that's
all
that
the
plaintiff
could
a-
could
accomplish
in
court
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
secretary's
enforcement
authority
is
coextensive
with
what
the
court
would
be
able
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
need
an
allegation
of
a
policy
or
practice.
justice
antonin
scalia
from
the
maybe
the
attorn-
solicitor
general
can
tell
us
if
the
seven
people
are
overworked?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
office
can't
really
give
relief
to
any
individual,
however,
right,
except
to
tell
the
tell
the
school
not
to
release
wrongfully
release
records
in
the
future,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
is
eliminate
the
policy,
and
everything
that's
happened
in
the
past
is
water
over
the
dam
and...
justice
antonin
scalia
go
and
sin
no
more
is
what
the
secretary
says,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
b
is
on
six
a,
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
switching
briefs
on
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
it
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
you
don't
have
a
policy
or
practice,
the
whole
provision
doesn't
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
i'm
really
not
following
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
but
that
whole
provision,
no
funds
shall
be
made
available,
only
applies
to
an
educational
agency
or
institution
which
has
a
policy
or
practice
of
releasing.
justice
antonin
scalia
policy
or
practice
of
releasing,
it's
entirely
exempt
from
that
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
i-
i
mean,
if
the
information
is
released
and
the
parent
says,
i
object,
the
institution
can
say,
oh,
i'm
sorry,
that
was
just
just
just
a
mistake.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
have
right
the
the
word
right
used
in
b
as
well
as
in
a,
or
at
least
with
reference
to
b
as
well
as
with...
justice
antonin
scalia
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
you
advance
the
ball
at
all
by
saying
what
they
were
worried
about
was
precisely
this
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
your
your
assertion
that
that
there
that
there
is
no
right
to
an
injunction,
you
can't
get
an
injunction
under
under
this
act,
but
you
can't
you
can't
get
an
injunction,
even
if
we
accept
your
your
theory
of
the
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
suggests
that
you're
not
vindicating
a
private
right
of
of
yours,
that
that
that
that
that
somehow
what
congress
is
concerned
with
is
the
existence
of
a
policy
or
practice
that
it
doesn't
like.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
you're
being
harmed
by
this
release,
under
your
theory
you
can't
get
an
injunction
against
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
policy
or...
justice
antonin
scalia
h-
how
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
witness,
and
if
you
don't
have
such
a
witness,
you
cannot
get
an
injunction,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
give
us
one
other
example
of
a
right
that
depends
upon
whether
the
person
allegedly
violating
the
right
has
done
it
before?
justice
antonin
scalia
policy
or
practice
of
doing
it?
for
example,
you
know,
your
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
whom
you
can
sue.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe,
but
it's
a
very
strange
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
rights
question,
too,
that
i
yu-
you're
relying
on
the
use
of
the
right,
of
the
term,
right,
in
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
refer
to
existing
state
privacy
rights,
or
just
to
sort
of
a
moral
a
moral
notion
of
what
things
should
be
kept
private?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
answerable
to
us,
presumably.
