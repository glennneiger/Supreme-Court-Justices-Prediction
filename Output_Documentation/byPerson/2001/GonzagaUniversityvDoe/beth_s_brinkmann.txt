ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
ferpa,
congress
gave
parents
the
right
to
prevent
the
release
of
certain
education
records.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
paragraph
two
begins
that
no...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
and
explains
that
has
a
policy
or...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it's
on
page
eight
a
of
the
bu-
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i'm
sorry.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it's
on
page
eight
a
of
the
blue
brief,
if
you
prefer
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
unless.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
th-
if
you
don't
have
a
policy
or
practice
of
releasing
information
other
than
under
the
preceding
section
b
one,
you're
correct,
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
b
one
says
you
can't
a
school
can't
have
a
policy
of
releasing
without
consent,
other
than
to
certain...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
not
what
not
na-
that's
not
what
b
two
a
says.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
any
personally
identifiable
information,
other
than
directory
information,
or
is
permitted
under
paragraph
one.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
so...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
they
did
not
congress
did
not
intend
to
go
after
inadvertent
releases.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
they
may
choose
not
to.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
in
addition
to
the
language,
unless
there
is,
our
our
position
is,
because
there
is
that
requirement,
unless
there
is
written
consent
from
the
parent,
congress
intended
to
directly
benefit
the
parents
and
to
say
to
the
parents
in
a
particular
situation,
you
can
say
no,
i
don't
want
this
information
released.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
there
is,
your
honor,
because
the
if
they
do
have
a
policy
in
process,
it's
akin
to
the
standard
that
the
court
adopted
in
gebser,
and
here
congress
did
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
which
is
the
commonality
in
all
of
the
spending
clause
cases
that
have
come
before
the...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
there's
never
been
a
formula.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no
statute
of
that
language
has
ever
come
before
the
court,
your
honor,
and
all
i'm
saying
is,
there
are
many
other
s-
cases
in
which
statutes
have
been
found
to
accord
rights
under
section
nineteen
eighty-three
that
don't
have
that
no-student-shall
language.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that
statute
has
not
come
before
the
court.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
the
precise
language
in
that
statute
which
is
quoted
in
that
footnote
says
that
no
federal
funds
payments
shall
be
made,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
precisely,
your
honor
here
because
they
are
specifically
talking
not
just
about
b
generically,
but
about
pe-
permission
or
consent.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because
the
whole
provision
of
d
refers
to
permission
or
consent,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
provision,
they
are
referring
to
the
actual
permission
or
consent,
because
that's
when
you
would
need
to
know,
do
i
go
to
the
when
i
for
a
college
student,
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
your
honor,
this
is
specifically
addressing
the
permission
or
consent...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
heading
of
subsection
d.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
actually
that,
ironically,
b-
b-
leads
me
to
my
third
point,
in
fact.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
it
was
the
point
that
justice
ginsburg
brought
up
before,
which
actually
i
think
responds
to
your
inquiry.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
actually
it's
much
more
complicated
than
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because
the
relationship
of
students
with
a
private
school
is
different
than
a
relationship
with
a
public
school.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
only
if
the
school
receives
federal
funds.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
only
universities,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
absolutely
could
get
an
injunction,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because
you
needed
the
testimony
of
one
witness
in
this
case
who
said,
we
do
this
all
of
the
time.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
right.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
i
have
at
least
five
answers.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
that
the
the
fpco
office
serves
a
admirable
and
y-
meritorious
role.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
it
works
generally,
and
then
you
look
at
the
blessing
inquiry
to
see
if
congress
intended
to
create
a
right,
they
intended
to
create
a
right
from
all
of
those
reasons
i
have
said.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
then
it's
presumptively
available,
a
section
nineteen
eighty-three
action.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because
the
presumption
has
to
be
overcome
by
an
enforcement
scheme,
an
administrative
scheme
that
supplants
the
section
nineteen
eighty-three
that
has
some
address
for
a
private...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
absolutely,
your
honor,
but
here
there
is
absolutely
no
availability
for
any
remedy
for
an
individual
injury,
and
sea
clammers...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
not
under
b
two
a,
if
they
have
released
records.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
was
going
to
cite
the
monell
case.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
a
policy
or
practice
may
not
have
injured
anyone
in
the
past.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
i
have
to
emphasize,
our
statutory
argument
about
rights
is
not
based
solely
on
the
twelve
thirty-two
g
d
referenced
rights.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it's
not
the
same
conduct,
your
honor,
if
i
may.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
thank
you,
your
honor.
