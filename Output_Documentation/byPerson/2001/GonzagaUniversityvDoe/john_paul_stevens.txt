primarily
a
distinction
that
makes
a
difference
in
c-
connection
with
whether
there's
an
implied
cause
of
action,
rather
than
whether
nineteen
eighty-three
authorized
a
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
b-
be
sure
i've
understand
your
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
initial
submission
is
that
this
is
not
a
rights-creating
statute,
it
just
er-
addre-
but
but
i
don't
know
where
the
right
comes
from
that
they
refer
to
in
that
section
and
also
in...
justice
john
paul
stevens
parents
and
students
of
rights
under
this
section.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
stu-
they
they
would
have
had
the
rights
described
herein
even
if
this
statute
had
not
been
passed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
opportunity
in
the
statute
wherever
the
statute
used
the
word
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
three
letters
a
day.
justice
john
paul
stevens
same
question
i
asked
mr.
roberts,
i
suppose,
but
the
first
sentence
of
twelve
thirty-two
g
a
one
a
refers
to
a
policy
of
denying
access,
denying
the
right
to
inspect
and
review
education
record.
[:records]
in
your
view,
is
that
right
a
federally
created
right,
or
is
that
a
right
created
by
some
other
source
and,
if
so,
what
is
the
source
of
the
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
the
blue
brief,
and
the
first,
very
first
sentence
in
the
in
the
statute
ends
by
saying
the
right
to
inspect
and
review
the
education...
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
my
question
is
whether
you
think
that
is
a
federally
created
right
and,
if
not,
what
is
the
source
of
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
right
to
which
the
statute
refers
is
a
federally
created
right,
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
right
with
a
different
source?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
a
school
came
back
and
said,
in
our
state
there's
no
such
right,
justice
john
paul
stevens
i-
it
it
is
som-
something
they
should
have
by
reason
of
this
statute,
and
therefore
it's
rightly
created,
or
by
reason
of
some
preexisting
rule
of
law
in
some
at
some
other
source?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
state
or
the
institution
could
say,
in
this
locality
there
is
no
such
right,
and
that
would
make
the
statute
totally
inapplicable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nonexistent
right,
if
i
understand
you...
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
you're
going
to
tell
us
about
the
monell
case.
