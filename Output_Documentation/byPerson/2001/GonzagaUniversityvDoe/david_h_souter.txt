justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
when
he
used
the
word,
opportunity,
that
this
is
kind
of
the
that
the
scheme
of
this
section
is
sort
of
an
if-then
sort
of
scheme.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
there's
there's
an
opportunity.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
if
the
force
if
we
accept
the
force
of
your
argument,
then
i
think
we'd
we'd
have
to
say,
well,
congress
really
didn't
need
to
bother
with
the
centralized
administration
provision,
and
yet
congress
did
put
it
in,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
most
likely
reason
that
it
put
it
in
is
the
reason
that
justice
breyer
just
gave.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
may
have
may
have
mayed
have
made
a
good
argument
for
getting
rid
of
it,
but
as
long
as
it's
there,
it
seems
to
have
the
same
lesson
that
his
his
question
suggests.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
may
be
a
very
good
argument
for
saying
that
what
congress
had
in
mind,
in
effect,
in
in
confining
the
enforcement
the
way
it
seems
to
have
done
by
this
exclusive
authority
provision
works
in
the
general
run
of
cases,
and
therefore
there
is
not
a
good
reason
to
say
that
congress
probably
would
have
wanted
this
private
right
of
action
with
the
punitive
damages.
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
at
the
we're
at
we're
beyond
stage
one,
two...
justice
david
h.
souter
are
there
particular
reasons
to
think
that
they
that
they
did
not.
