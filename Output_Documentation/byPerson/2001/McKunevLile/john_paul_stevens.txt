i
ask
you,
mr.
mcallister,
do
you
know
i-
if
and
there's
similar
programs
in
a
lot
of
states,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
know
i
asked
your
opponent
this
question
the
extent
to
which
other
states
have
granted
immunity
to
solve
this
problem?
justice

paul
stevens
that's
what
distinguishes
the
detriment
and
the
benefit.
