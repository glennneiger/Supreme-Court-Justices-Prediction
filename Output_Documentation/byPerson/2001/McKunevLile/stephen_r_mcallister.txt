mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
choices
have
consequences,
but
they
nonetheless
remain
choices.
the
mere
withdrawal
of
prison
privileges
such
as
a
personal
television
or
how
much
an
inmate
may
spend
at
the
canteen,
privileges
which
are
not
part
of
an
inmate's
sentence
and
to
which
an
inmate
has
no
legal
entitlement,
does
not
amount
to
constitutional
compulsion
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
certainly
not
when
the
reason
for
the
withdrawal
of
those
privileges
is
the
inmate's
failure
to
comply
with
an
unquestionably
legitimate
treatment
requirement
that
he
accept
responsibility
for
his
offenses.
[inaudible]
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
that's
true,
justice
souter,
and
our
program
does
differ
from
the
federal
program
in
that
respect,
but
it
is
still
a
choice
for
mr.
lile.
he
does
not
have
to
incriminate
himself
in
any
way.
his
refusal
to
participate
is
not
at
all
incriminating.
and
what
we're
talking
about
in
terms
of
what
he
may
lose
here
are
are
really
relatively
mild
incentives
within
the...
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
prison.
i
i
thought...
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
if
he
simply
refuses
to
participate,
there's
no
incrimination
whatsoever.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
he
can
be,
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
the
kansas
regulations
say,
if
an
inmate
is
is
recommended
for
this
treatment
program
and
he
refuses,
he
goes
from
level
three
to
level
one.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
he's
actually
not,
because
he
got
an
injunction
against
the
in
this
case
against...
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
actually
carrying
out
this
program.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
yes,
he
is.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
at
level
three,
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
possibly.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
and
in
the
context
of...
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
that's
certainly
a
possibility.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
no.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
yes,
potentially.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
i
think
that's
a
different
case.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
two
things,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
but
in
the
first
amendment
context
he
has
a
right,
a
free
speech
right
or
a
right
of
access
to
the
courts
that
may
be
at
issue.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
think
it's
potentially
different,
although
it
is
potentially
permissible
constitutionally,
but
the
question
would
become,
what
sort
of
a
legitimate
valid
penological
interest
do
we
have?
do
we
have
such
an
interest
in
having
every
inmate
do
that
from
the
day
they
enter
prison?
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
we
could
make
that
argument.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
it's
much
more
than
that
in
this
case,
because
here
the
the
the
therapists
are
clear
that
denial
is
a
big
problem
with
sex
offenders.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
with
all
due
respect,
justice
o'connor,
we
would
not
say
we're
compelling
them.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
because
the-
these
fellows
have
proven
that
most
or,
not
most,
but
many
of
them
will
not
voluntarily
engage
in
this
program,
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
because
we
still
have
an
interest
in
rehabilitating
all
of
these
sex
offenders.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
no,
and
that's
why
he
has
the
choice.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
if
there's
if
there's
as
long
as
there's
under
turner
a
legitimate
penological
interest,
yes,
potentially
we
could.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
absolutely.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
an-
and
there's
certainly
not,
for
example,
treatment
programs
necessarily
for
burglars
or
robbers
or
other
categories.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
yes,
potentially,
and
and
that's
not,
in
our
view,
a
constitutional
problem,
because
this
case
this
court
has
long
said
for
example
none
of
the
things
we're
talking
about
here
are
atypical
in
prison.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
justice
breyer,
to
say
the
first
is
different,
or
or
in
essence
we're
different,
because
all
of
our
this
takes
place
inside
the
prison.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
except,
justice
kennedy
it
may
do
that.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
but
my
understanding
is
they
could
do
that
in
the
federal
program
as
well,
because
there's
no
immunity
granted
under
the
federal
program
either.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
that's
true,
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
could.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
e-
justice
stevens,
it's
my
understanding
that
some
may,
although
i
don't
know
the
exact
number,
and
i
do
know
from
the
state
amicus
brief
the
eighteen
states
that
signed
onto
that
obviously
think
immunity
is
a
bad
idea
and,
as
i
said,
the
federal
government
does
not
immunize
the...
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
know
the
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
yes,
but
i
mean,
in
our
view
there's
an
important
penological
reason
for
doing
that.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
because,
all
i'm
saying
is
at
some
point
even
even
sandin
recognizes
at
some
point
things
are
atypical
and
they
exceed
the
line,
so
although
he
could
be
moved
to
disciplinary
segregation
without
a
due
process
hearing,
if
he
was
put
in
solitary
confinement,
that
might
have
been
different.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
because
the
text
of
the
fifth
amendment
says
no
person
shall
be
compelled,
and
the
question
is
compulsion,
and
at
some
point,
if
we
took
away
everything,
or
we
made
him
work
twenty
hours
a
day
or
we
could
do
things
to
him
that
i
think
the
court
would
would
have...
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
that's
part...
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
and
that
that
i
agree
with.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
all
the
privileges,
because
it
has
to
rise
to
the
level
of
compulsion.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
that's
the
question,
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
[inaudible]
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
that's
all
right.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
all
right.
