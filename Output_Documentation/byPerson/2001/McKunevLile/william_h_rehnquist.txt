[inaudible]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
program
i-
is
full,
then
i-
i-
i-
is
your
interest
in
simply
getting
statements
of
of
guilt
or
something
from
people
who
will
never
go
into
the
program?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
also
rely,
don't
you,
mr.
mcallister,
on
the
fact
that
se-
the
therapists
for
this
particular
type
of
type
of
crime
have
come
down
very
hard
on
the
idea,
and
i
take
it
perhaps
there
may
not
be
the
same
body
of
support
for
that
sort
of
treatment
of
other
offenders.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcallister.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
say
inducing,
does
it?
it
says
compelling.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wiltanger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean,
i-
someone
who
commits
arson
in
prison
gets
only
those
penalties?
he
isn't
prosecuted
for
committing
arson?
there
could
be
a
potential
prosection
if
they...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
court,
what
cases
do
you
think
most
most
strongly
support
your
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
talking
about
i-
loss
of
job
an
in
a
in
a
in
a
civilian
society.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
a
situation
where
in
civilian
life
the
person
who
le-
loses
his
job
loses
his
livelihood,
basically.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
doesn't
benefit
prisoners
as
a
class.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
solution
that
isn't
consistent
with
the
therapist's
idea
that
this
is
how
it
should
be
done.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
one
one
difference,
certainly
between
the
first
amendment
and
its
cases
and
the
fifth
amendment
is
that
there
is
a
compulsion
requirement
in
order
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment,
where
where
the
first
amendment
doesn't
have
anything
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
s-
wiltanger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
give
him
some
rebuttal
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
extend
your
time
for
two
minutes,
mr.
mcallister,
because
you
really
didn't
have
a
chance
to
say
much
of
anything,
i'm
afraid.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
number
00-1187
mckune
versus
lile
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
