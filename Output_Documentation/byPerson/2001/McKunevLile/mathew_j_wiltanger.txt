mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
it's
wiltanger,
your
honor.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
if
you're
a
prisoner
in
kansas
and
you
commit
a
rape
while
in
prison,
you
get
the
same
penalties
that
mr.
lile
gets.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
but
under
the
state
system
they
get
moved
down
to
the
same
level
that
mr.
lile
is,
and
in
fact
their
punishment
could
be
worse,
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
i
think
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
is
somewhat
illustrated
by
the
government's
attorney
in
that
this
is
not
voluntary,
and
that
once
you
achieve
a
level
the
state
has
state
has
set
up
a
structure,
your
honor,
under
which
if
you're
good,
you
do
your
job,
you
get
to
a
certain
level,
and
that's
for
everybody.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
i
would
disagree
with
that,
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
because
people
in
the
prison
system
who
do
not
participate
in
treatment
get
the
same
privileges.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
why
did
he
lose
his
privileges?
well,
he
hasn't,
technically,
your
honor,
lost
his...
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
non...
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
have
no
ability,
but
but
other
there
w-
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
could
be
other
sex
offenders
in
the
prison
who
are
not
required
to
take
satp,
for
example,
if
there
was
a
if
if
for
some
reason
there
was
a
statutory
rape
penalty
they
may
not
be
required
to
take
satp.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
your
honor,
i
think
the
cases
of
garrity,
gardner,
cunningham
support
the...
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
i
do,
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
specifically
as
to
the
job,
mr.
lile,
if
if
any
inmate
in
the
prison
system
in
kansas,
if
they
were,
for
example,
in
minimum
security
can
work
an
outside
job.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
he
will
eat,
your
honor,
but
at
the
same
same
same
time
a
policeman
on
guard
or
a
policeman
in
garrity
could
go
out
and
get
another
job
and
earn
something,
an
equivalent
wage,
or
possibly
even
a
better
wage.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
no,
they
haven't,
your
honor.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
i
don't
your
honor,
our
view
is
not
is
that
that
is
not
compulsion,
because
what
is
being
extended
to
the
murder
suspect
is
a
benefit,
some
way
to
improve
your
lot.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
well,
the
constitution
obviously
prohibits
any
kind
of
sanction
for
the
invocation
of
your
fifth
amendment
rights.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
your
honor,
i
i
do
think
that's
certainly
closer
to
the
const-
that
that
would
be
closer
to
a
constitutional
law.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
not
be,
your
honor.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
not
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
if
they
could
set
up
a
system
or
a
structure
or
or
fashion
r-
some
rules
obviously,
they
don't
have
that
now,
then
i
don't
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
i
d-
i
do
believe
so,
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
n-
not
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
because
all
inmates
in
the
pri-
there
were
th-
there
are
not
just
inmates
at
level
three
who
were
grandfathered
in.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
absolutely.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
if
they
have
not
they
have
not
changed
the
rule.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
well,
the
state
wants
als-
wants
their
sex
offenders
to
take
it.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
hm.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
that
is
correct,
and
and
and
kee-
please
understand,
your
honor,
that
that
is
only
one
possible
solution
that
would
allow
the
state
to
continue
to
run
its
satp.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
potentially,
your
honor.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
sure
why
it
has
to
be
a
written
statement
where
you
f-
you
fess
everything
up.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
i
your
honor,
i
agree.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
there
are
a
couple
of
states
that
i
know
off-hand,
your
honor.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
well,
first,
your
honor,
if
this
court
doesn't
want
to
get
drawn
into
a
benefit
versus
a
punishment
distinction,
you
don't
have
to
follow
that
for
this
rule.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
well,
i
d-
i
do
believe
that
i
do
believe
that
that
sanction
or
or
what
you
can
look
at
is,
you
could
look
at
the
thi-
this
court's
ruling
as
to
what
is
a
voluntary
statement
in
the
collin
case,
whether
or
not
he's
being
able
to
make
an
unconstrained
choice.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
your
honor,
i
think
that
does
a
couple
of
things,
and
and
why
we
disagree
with
sandin.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
your
honor,
i
would
agree
to
you
that
mr.
lile
has
no
liberty
interest
at
play
here,
but
i
would
also
suggest
that
there
is
no
liberty
interest
in
an
at-will
employment.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
but
but
the
but
the
way
that
the
state
has
set
up
its
structure,
they
have
made
rules
that
they
want
everybody
working.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
and
certainly
i
would
i
would
agree
with
what's
previously
said,
that
there
could
be
a
legitimately
penological
purpose
in
confessing,
in
coming
clean,
and
that
you
will
not
be
a
model
prisoner
unless
you
take
responsibility
for
your
crime,
whether
it
be
a
sex
offense
or
whether
it
be
a
murder.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
your
honor,
i
i
i
agree
with
i
agree
with
with
the
concern
over
the
technical
distinction
between
benefit
and
penalty.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
assume
for
the
moment
mr.
lile
were
not
grandfathered
in.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
okay.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
well
he
would
enter
the
prison
system
at
at
intake
level
one.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
eighteen
years
from
now
the
state
will
ask
him
to
take
sex
offender
treatment.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
he
will
get
all
the
way
.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
two
thousand
nineteen
they
say
to
him,
please
take...
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
i
agree.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
and
that's
again
wha-
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
no,
your
honor,
i...
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
think
that
would
be
constitutional,
your
honor.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
i
think
it
would
be
set
up
as
a
way
to
get
around
satp
and
a
way
to
get
around
the
invocation
of
your
fifth...
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
the
one
the
one
thing
i
would
encourage
this
court
to
look
at
is,
look
at
how
it
affects
itself
on
the
prisoner.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
if
it's
entirely
divorced
from
the
program
or
the
fifth
amendment,
then
your
honor,
then
that
potentially
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
somewhat,
your
honor.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
and
i
agree,
if
the
state
had
set
up
a...
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
that
is...
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
no,
your
honor,
you're
you're
correct,
a-
and
again
that's
consistent
with
the
view
that
we
took
between
the
benefit
and
the
sanction,
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
no,
your
honor,
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
i
apologize
if
i
misspoke.
mr.
mathew
j.
wiltanger
essentially,
yes,
that
is
correct.
