the
the
problem,
though,
is
he's
he's
forced,
in
effect,
to
to
confront
the
the
treatment
possibility.
it's
not
an
option.
i
mean,
i-
t-
the
tough
part
of
the
case
for
me,
i
think,
is
the
fact
that
this
is
this
is
not
a
scheme,
as
i
understand
the
federal
scheme
to
be,
in
which
the
inmate
says,
i
want
to
take
advantage
of
this
treatment
program.
this
is
a
scheme
in
which
the
state
says,
you're
going
to
take
advantage
of
it,
and
if
you
don't
take
advantage
of
it,
including
the
the
the
the
admissions
in
the
reports
of
other
offenses,
and
so
on,
you're
going
to
lose
substantial
privileges.
that's
that,
to
me,
is
the
tough
part
of
the
case.

a
possibility.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
the
only
person
who's
going
to
be
in
the
position
that
justice
scalia
described
is
the
person
who's
been
getting
in
trouble
along
the
way
and
never
does
progress.
justice
david
h.
souter
penological
interest
satisfied
in
confining
the
program
to
those
who
want
to
be
in
it
who
will
not
be
subject
to
this
compulsion,
if
that's
what
it
is?
i
mean,
your
your
argument
is
that
we
have
a
penological
interest,
in
effect,
that
justifies
these
consequences.
justice
david
h.
souter
fill
your
program
without
even
having
to
raise
the
issue
that
involves
these
consequences,
why
do
you
have
a
penological
interest
in
in
the
insistence
that
gives
rise
to
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
assuming
that
is
so.
justice
david
h.
souter
who
will,
why
why
is
there
an
interest
in
effect
in
forcing
the
issue
for
those
who
do
not
want
to
do
it
voluntarily?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
constitutionally,
if
if
suddenly
somebody
got
a
good
idea
here
and
a
a
psychiatrist
came
forward
saying
yes,
you
you
can
you
you
can
reform
property
criminals
too,
we'd
be
in
exactly
the
same
boat.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
don't
suffer
any
loss
of
anything
if
they
if
they
don't
make
the
statement
and...
justice
david
h.
souter
under
yours,
in
any
case,
whether
the
feds
do
it
or
not,
under
yours
the
prosecutor
could
use
that
information,
couldn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
choice
to
go
into
the
program
is
strictly
the
inmates.
justice
david
h.
souter
a
benefit
that
he
currently
has?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
the
federal
system,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
specific
about
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
to
decide
what
is
compulsion
you've
got
to
look
at
i-
how
other
people
are
treated,
in
effect.
justice
david
h.
souter
a
a
a
a
a
comparative
analysis
as
as
between
classes
of
prisoners
depending
on
their
offense?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
wouldn't
the
same
penological
reason
justify
taking
away
all
privileges?
in
other
words,
why
did
you
make
the
concession
you
made
at
the
beginning
of
your
rebuttal?
justice
david
h.
souter
solitary
confinement
it
would
be
justifiable,
if
at
all,
because
of
a
penological
reason,
the
way
he
had
behaved
in
prison,
creating
dangerous
conditions,
et
cetera.
justice
david
h.
souter
your
argument,
you're
saying,
one
reason
why
you
should
not
characterize
this
as
compulsion
is
the
valid
penological
reason
for
doing
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
suggestion
is,
if
there
if
if
if
if
the
state
should
say,
look,
the
protection
of
these
victims
on
the
outside,
who
are
going
to
be
preyed
upon
by
this
person
if
not
rehabilitated,
is
just
as
important
as
preventing
people
from
setting
fires
in
their
cells,
and
therefore,
if
we
take
away
all
privileges
to
the
fire-setters,
we've
got
an
equally
good
penological
reason
to
take
away
all
privileges
from
the
person
who
won't
go
into
the
program.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
go
ahead.
