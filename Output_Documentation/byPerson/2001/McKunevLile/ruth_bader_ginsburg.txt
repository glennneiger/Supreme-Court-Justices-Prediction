justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
the
kansas
do
that
this
with
respect
to
a
prisoner
who's
writing
letters
to
the
editor,
to
the
newspaper,
complaining
about
prison
conditions?
they
say,
well,
this
all
this
is
privileged.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
first
amendment
different
from
the
self-incrimination
clause?
i
mean,
if
in
the
one
case
you
can't
disadvantage
the
person
for
exercising
that
constitutional
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
the
first
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
first
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
is
not
a
voluntary
program.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
is
there
or
isn't
there?
is
it
in
the
case
of
every
one
that
you
incarcerate
there
is
an
interest
in
rehabilitating
that
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
have
said
that
the
first
step
in
rehabilitation
is
acceptance
of
responsibility
for
the
wrong
that
you've
done.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
conceded
that
a
prosecutor,
say,
in
the
sexual
history
says,
i
committed
x,
y,
z
rapes
and
that
a
prosecutor,
as
long
as
there's
no
statute
of
limitations
problem,
in
kansas
unlike,
as
i
understand
the
federal
program
is,
a
prosecutor
could
say,
okay,
now
we're
going
to
indict
you
for
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
o-
of
those,
how
many
are
like
kansas?
that
is,
it
isn't
a
voluntary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
right
to
take
other
programs
in
the
prison?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
substantial
reduction
in
how
much
you
can
earn
in
prison,
what
jobs
you
can
do
in
prison,
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
said
you
said
in
your
opening
statement,
and
you
seem
to
be
backing
away
from
it,
you
said
the
federal
program
is
a
voluntary
program.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
like...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
anything
other
than
physical,
or
psychological?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
in
in
outside
prison
we
know,
at
least
this
court's
precedent
has
said
losing
your
membership
in
the
bar,
losing
your
job,
that
counts
as
compulsion,
even
though
no
one
is
putting
you
on
the
rack
and
screw.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
it
in
your
brief,
and
i
wanted
to
make
sure
that
it
really
is
your
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
never
get
out
of
it
unless
you
take
this
program?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
be,
or...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
not...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
whole
thing,
then,
it
comes
down
to,
subtraction
is
no
good.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
a
a
product
that
the
they
don't
have
the
facility
to
give
this
course
to
everyone,
so
they
say,
when
you're
getting
closer
to
release
time,
you
get
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
their
first
year,
i
when
what
i
understand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
brief
described
a
system
where,
suppose
we
had
all
sex
offenders,
they
go
in
at
level
one
unless
they
take
the
program.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
something
that
doesn't
exist
in
current
world
only
because
of
a
lack
of
resources,
that
kansas
can't
give
this
program
to
all
the
people
who
would
qualify,
so
it
concentrates
on
the
people
who
have
served
a
substantial
part
of
their
sentence
already.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
ask
you
to
concentrate
on
that
question
a
little
harder,
because
you
did
say
in
your
brief
that
if
all
sex
offenders
not
all
prisoners,
all
sex
offenders
on
day
one
were
in
put
in
class
one,
they
could
stay
there
and
never
get
out
unless
the
the
carrot
that
was
dangled
was
taken.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
apparently
you
are
not...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
prisoners.
