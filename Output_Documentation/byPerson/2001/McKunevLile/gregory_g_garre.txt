mr.
gregory
g.
garre
justice
scalia,
the
federal
government
has
has
a
very
limited
program
it
applies
in
only
one
facility
nation-wide.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
oh,
the
the
federal
government
reserves
the
right
of
the
same
confidentiality
limits
that
the
state
does.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
that's
absolutely
clear
from
the
from
the
waiver
the
confidentiality
statement
that
that
inmates
sign
before
they
enroll
in
the
program.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i-
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
the
o-
the
overriding
incentive
is,
of
course,
the
value
of
the
treatment
that
the
inmate
receives.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
th-
tha-
that's
true
up
front
in
terms
of
the
incentive
scheme.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
the
way
the
federal
bureau
of...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
is
at
a
more
desirable...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
we
we
don't
we
think
think
that
the
that
the
privileges
that
we're
talking
about
in
the
case
of
pra-
kansas,
tv
ownership,
personal
tv
in
the
cell,
visitation
privileges
beyond
immediate
family,
and
and
lawyers,
canteen
expenditures,
these
aren't
these
aren't...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
th-
the
privileges
are
reduced.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
e-
th-
there's
there
is
a
definite
reduction,
and
the
flip
side
of
that
is
kansas
reserves
the
higher
privileges,
the
more
modern
facilities
to
those
inmates
who
choose
to
take
the
constructive
steps
towards
reentering
society.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
there's
no
the
the
the
federal
system
currently
doesn't
employ
the
same
earnable
privilege
scheme
that
the
kansas
person...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
correct,
except
that
the
inmate
can
be
sent
back
to
his
parent...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
with
respect,
we
think
that
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
i
th-
foremost
because
the
fifth
amendment
says,
compelled
self-incrimination.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
that
type
of
hypotheticals
is
much
different,
much
further
afield
than
the...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
says
compelling.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
oh,
sure.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
and
and
we
think
we
agree
with
judge
friendly
and
others
who
have
suggested
that
those
cases
lie
at
the
outer
reaches
of
this
court's
fifth
amendment
jurisprudence,
a-
and
we
think
that
the
denial
of
the
sorts
of
common,
routine
privileges
at
issue
in
this
case,
tv
privileges,
canteen
expenditures,
don't
even
come...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
it's
not
a
complete
loss
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
i
i
mean,
the
further
the
the
court
goes
out
in
that
direction,
then
obviously
at
some
point
that
that
program
would
be
more
difficult
to
defend
under
the
turner...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
w-
with
respect,
we
we
don't
think
that
that's
the
kansas
program.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i-
e-
again,
m-
i
would
disagree
with
the
d-
the
the
characterization
of
the
kansas
program,
but
but
more
importantly
we
think
that
the
judgment
made
by
the
federal
bureau
of
prison
and
the
judgment
made
by
the
kansas
prison
officials
are
well
within
the
range
of
decisions
that
this
court's
prison
decisions...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
y-
your
description
presents
a
different
situation.
