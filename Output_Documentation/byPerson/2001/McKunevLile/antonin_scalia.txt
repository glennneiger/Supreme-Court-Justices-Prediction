in
the
future
,
what's
at
issue
is
is
not
being
deprived
of
benefits
you
already
have,
but
of
not
giving
you
benefits
that
you
don't
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
chopped
down
from
three
to
one
was
that
the
that
he
was
grandfathered.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
would
simply
not
make
it
from
one
to
two
and
from
two
to
three,
if
he
didn't
go
into
the...
justice
antonin
scalia
because
there
there's
been
some
dispute
between
you
and
the
other
side
as
to
whether
this
is
simply
the
denial
of
a
benefit
or
a
punishment,
and
i'm
not
sure
there's
a
whole
lot
of
difference,
but...
justice
antonin
scalia
people
it
looks
more
like
a
punishment.
justice
antonin
scalia
a-
as
as
i
recall
it,
the
first
amendment
says
speaks
of
abridgement,
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
and
and
the
fifth
amendment
speaks
of
compulsion.
justice
antonin
scalia
[ns]
mr.
garre,
why
does
the
federal
government
not
think
it
a
good
idea
to
grant
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
around
to
answering
my
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
federal
government
think
it
not
a
good
idea
to
grant
immunity
in
its
program?
justice
antonin
scalia
only
those
things
can
be
prosecuted?
i
thought
i
thought
that
it
that
i-
that
that
prosecution
was
available
for
anything
that
was
that
was
disclosed,
although
although
there
was
confidentiality.
justice
antonin
scalia
limits,
not
immunity
limits,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
federal
government
has
has
not
given
use
immunity
u-
for...
justice
antonin
scalia
desirable
facility?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
he
loses...
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
he
isn't
he
doesn't
get
out
of
the
rotten
place
he's
in
to
to
a
better...
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
garre,
justice
antonin
scalia
we
in
fact
have
two
classes
in
in
in
all
prison
systems?
those
who
have
pleaded
guilty
and
and
have
gotten
a
relatively
short
sentence
by
reason
of
their
guilty
plea
for
a
particular
crime,
and
those
who
have
refused
to
plead
guilty
and
have
gotten
a
longer
sentence
because
of
their
refusal
to
do
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
two
classes
in
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
just
not
being
able
to
spend
as
much
at
the
px,
but
but
they're
there
for
another
another
fifteen
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
number
of
years
in
more
in
jail.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
arsonist
considers
that
the
least
of
his
worries.
justice
antonin
scalia
non
sex
offenders?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
no
ability
to
go
into
the
program?
justice
antonin
scalia
category
of
prisoner,
justice
antonin
scalia
i
i
am...
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry,
mis-
mr.
wiltanger.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
you
know,
i-
either
you
do
it,
or
you're
going
to
get
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
them
in
start
them
off
in
the
worst
situation
and
just
say,
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
can't
turn
on
that
on
on
that,
whether
you
characterize
it
as
giving
them
a
benefit
or
depriving
them
of
one
a
benefit
they
all...
justice
antonin
scalia
so
so
you
think
the
the
sentencing
guidelines
would
be
invalid
if,
instead
of
the
current
provision,
which
gives
you
good
points
for
acceptance
of
responsibility,
it
rather
gave
you
bad
points
for
refusing
to
accept
responsibility.
justice
antonin
scalia
constitutional
distinction.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
solution.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
what
sandin
looked
to
in
in
true,
not
in
the
context
of
the
fifth
amendment,
but
in
another
context,
and
that
is
whether
what
you
have
been
deprived
of
in
prison
is
is
beyond
what
is
the
normal
expectation
of
prison
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
have
a
rule
that
arrives
that
that
applies
in
the
fifth
amendment
arena
with
regard
to
depriving
people
of
of
things
to
which
they
are
not
entitled
as
free
citizens.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
we
need
a
new
rule
for
in-prison
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
call
it
liberty,
just
call
it
a
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
entitled
as
a
free
citizen
to
have
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay
so
we'll
add
to
it,
there
has
to
be
a
and
and
the
the
state
of
kansas
is
perfectly
willing
to
add
to
it,
it
has
to
be
for
a
legitimate
penological
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
kansas
program
would
be
perfectly
okay,
in
in
in
your
estimation,
if
it
provided
that
at
the
end
of
eighteen
years
of
twenty-year
sentences,
or
two
years
before
the
end
of
their
sentence,
all
sex
offenders
shall
be
reduced,
all
sex
offenders
shall
be
reduced
to
prison
level
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not,
because
then
a-
then
if
they
choose
to
come
in
this
program
they
will
be
getting
the
benefit
of
going
back
up
to
three.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course
it's
an
artifice.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
same
it's
the
same
in
my
hypothetical,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
i
i
i
understood
you
the
other
way.
