the
the
kind
of
conundrum
that
i
that
that
puzzles
me
that
i
don't
have
an
answer
to
is
is
illustrated
by
the
trial
process
itself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
punishment,
you
assume
your
answer
in
your
favor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
true
that
their
system
is,
you
will
be
awarded
privileges
as
long
as
you
participate
in
treatment,
but
our
privileges
are
open
only
to
people
who
participate
in
treatment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
if
that's
so,
does
this
case
as
my
understanding
of
it
is
that
the
prison
created
a
new
policy,
and
that
policy
was
that
everybody
was
at
level
one
unless
you
participate
in
a
recommended
program,
that
that
was
their
new
policy,
but
that
your
client
was
grandfathered
in
at
level
three
because
he
was
in
prison
at
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
participating
in
a
recommended
program?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
changed
the
rule
and
said,
if
you
don't
participate
in
a
recommended
program,
you
can't
get
to
level
three.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
programs
are
important,
i
take
it,
r-
really
important,
and
and
they're
thinking
that
this
is
a
very
important
way
to
run
them,
i
i
give
them
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
thinking
about
that,
and
the
trouble
with
analogies,
if
you
get
one
that's
very
close,
you
become
uncertain
again.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
the
grandfather
i
mean,
i-
it
it
is
the
grandfather,
isn't
it,
in
his
case
that
makes
him
well
you
said
there
were
some
other
things,
and
i'd
like
to
be
sure
to
have
them
in
mind,
that
make
it
a
penalty
and
not
just
the
withholding
of
a
privilege.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mhm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
saying
with
the
cohort
of
prisoners
you'll
go
along
for
ten
years,
all
of
them
earning
points
and
credits.
