of

justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
an
opinion
announcing
that
judgment
of
the
court
in
this
case,
the
respondent
is
a
convicted
rapist
and
he
is
held
in
the
kansas
state
prison.
the
prison
officials
there
ordered
that
he
participate
in
a
treatment
program
for
sex
offenders
called
the
sexual
abuse
treatment
program
--
the
parties
refer
to
that
as
satp
--
and
the
program
requires
that
the
inmates
to
accept
responsibility
for
their
crimes
and
disclose
all
prior
sexual
crimes
and
offenses
regardless
of
whether
the
activities
constitutes
an
uncharged
criminal
offense.
the
information
obtained
from
these
program
participants
is
not
privileged
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
incriminating
information
from
the
participants
has
ever
been
disclosed.
the
prison
officials
informed
respondent
that
his
refusal
to
participate
in
the
program
will
result
in
his
transfer
back
to
a
maximum
security
unit.
it
will
also
adversely
affect
his
prison
privileges
such
as
visitation
rights,
work
opportunities,
and
his
access
to
other
privileges
like
personal
television.
the
respondent
refuse
to
participate
in
the
program
on
the
ground
that
the
required
disclosure
of
his
criminal
history
would
violate
his
fifth
amendment,
provision
againt
self-incrimination.
he
brought
this
action
for
injunctive
relief,
the
district
court
granted
him
summary
judgment
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed.
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
satp
is
supported
by
a
legitimate
penological
objectives
of
rehabilitation.
it
involves
substantial
daily
counseling
and
helps
inmates
address
sexual
addiction
and
develops
relapse
prevention
skills.
the
opinion
sights
some
studies
one
of
which
is
that
the
rate
of
recividism
for
sex
offenders
who
are
treated
in
prison
is
about
15%
whereas
the
rate
of
recidivism
of
untreated
offenders
is
estimated
to
be
as
high
as
80%
so
their
is
substantial
agreement
that
this
clinical
rehabilitation
programs
can
enable
these
sex
offenders
to
manage
their
impulses.
the
mere
fact
that
kansas
does
not
offer
legal
immunity
from
prosecution
does
not
render
the
program
invalid.
no
inmate
has
been
prosecuted
by
such
information
and
there
is
no
contention
but
the
program
is
a
mere
subterfuge
for
the
conduct
of
criminal
investigation.
the
consequences
for
non
participation
in
the
program
do
not
combine
to
create
a
compulsion
that
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
the
prison
context
is
important
in
weighing
the
respondent's
constitutional
claim
a
broad
range
of
choices
that
might
infringe
constitutional
rights
in
a
free
society
fall
within
the
expected
conditions
of
confinement
in
those
lawfully
convicted.
a
prisoner
clinical
rehabilitation
program
which
is
acknowledge
to
bear
a
rational
relation
to
a
legitimate
penological
objective
does
not
violate
the
privilege
against
compelled
self-incrimination,
if
the
adverse
consequences
and
inmates
faces
were
not
participating
are
related
to
the
program
objectives
and
do
not
constitute
atypical
and
significant
hardships
in
relation
to
the
ordinary
incidence
of
prison
life.
the
possible
transfer
from
the
medium
security
unit
to
a
maximum
security
unit
is
not
intended
to
punish
prisoners
for
exercising
their
fifth
amendment
right
rather
it
is
incidental
to
a
legitimate
penological
reasons.
where
the
respondent's
position
to
prevail
there
would
be
a
serious
doubt
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
sexual
offender
program
which
is
in
many
respects
comparable
to
the
kansas'
program.
respondent
analysis
would
also
call
into
question
the
constitutionality
of
the
downward
adjustment
of
the
sentence
for
acceptance
of
criminal
responsibility.
