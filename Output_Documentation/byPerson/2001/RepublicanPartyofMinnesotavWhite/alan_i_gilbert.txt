mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
take
the
opportunity
to
try
to
clarify
some
of
the
questions
and
answers
that
have
been
provided
as...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
what
the
construed
rule
in
minnesota
means.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
[inaudible]
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
beginning
of
the
second
paragraph,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
your
honor,
th-
this
is
where
the
record
is
very
clear
as
to
what
merse-
mr.
wersal
has
done.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
well,
that
would
be
a
future
case.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
your
honor...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
thirty...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
let's
see
thirty-four
to
thirty-eight,
and
eighty-six
to
ninety-one.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
and
candidates
can
say
that.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
absolutely.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
your
example,
your
honor,
the
candidate
can,
as
mr.
wersal
did,
criticize
a
prior
decision
of
the
court.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
does
in
the
sense,
your
honor,
that
there's
different
dynamics
involved
once
once
a
judge
is
elected
and
has
to
overturn
a
decision
that's
already
precedent...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
your
honor,
that's
the
point.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
might
well
imply
whether
he's
going
to
overturn
it.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
i-
if
you
look
at
pages
page
thirty-six
for
example
of
of
the
joi-
of
the...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
this
is
of
the
joint
appendix
he
says,
th-
c-
on
abortion,
the
court
ordered
the
state
must
use
welfare
funds
to
pay
for
abortion
despite
state
law
to
be
contrary.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
no.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
you
know,
your
it
might
be,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
and
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
perhaps.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
your
honor,
again,
the
de-
no,
under
under
the
state's
interpretation
of
the
roll.
[:
rule]
and
i
understand
your
point.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
your
honor,
we
think
so.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
well,
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
well,
i
again,
your
honor,
i
understand
the
hypothetical.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
n-
no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
that's...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
at
the
least.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
submit...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
the
challenger
is
in
a
better
situation...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
as
a
i'm
sorry,
as
a
sitting
judge,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
mhm.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
your
honor,
the
the
board
on
judicial
standards
or
the
lawyers
board
would
have
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
a
violation
which
sounds
like
a
technical
violation,
as
you
describe
it,
and
could
impose
some
discipline,
but
i
would
suspect
that
discipline
would
be
very
minute,
if
at
all...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
i'm
not
aware
of
any
authority
that
would
allow
a
criminal
sanction
for
such
a...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
mhm.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
y-
i'm
not
aware
of
authority
to
that
effect
either,
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
mhm.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
honor,
our
position
is,
just
as
the
aba
indicated,
that
our
rule
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
commitment
clause,
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
case,
and
in
you
are
right.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
well,
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
construction,
your
honor,
is,
for
all
practical
purposes,
identical
to
the
commitment
clause.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
you
know
you
can
put
them
together.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
ye-
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
ye-
yes,
your
honor,
with
the
distinction
being
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
judiciary.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
well,
but,
your
honor,
that's
the
fallacy
in
that
statement,
is
that
a
candidate
can
tell
the
electorate
what
kind
of
candidate
they
are.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
and
they
can
say
that
the
the
i
think
the
difference
of
opinion
we
have
here
is
whether
they
can
go
the
extra
step
and
just
say,
and
i
would
t-
try
to
overturn
the
decision
if
i'm
elected.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
they
can
do
that,
but
i
submit
to
you,
what
happens
if
that
judge
wins?
what
happen
if
that
judge
wins
and
litigants
come
before
that
judge
who
has
prejudged
that...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
oh
and
an-
it's...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
the
sudden
majority
opinion?
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
because
in
a
prior
opinion,
due
process
was
accorded,
because
the
judge
actually
heard
the
argument
of
the
litigants,
heard
the
facts
and
the
applicable
law.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
absolutely.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
that
anybody
who
wins
is
entitled
to
punitive...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
y-
your
honor
again,
this
is
a
balance
that's
being
struck.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
well,
your
honor,
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
well,
again,
your
honor,
we're
trying
to
weigh
the
different
interests.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
public
knows
or
doesn't
know.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
how
fair
is
that?
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
n-
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
i'm
surprised
to
hear
that,
in
light
of
the
the...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
that
is
in
our
brief
and
other
briefs...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
okay
but,
your...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
your
honor,
cases
are
made
up
of
issues.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
your
honor,
n-
i
don't
think
so,
not
at
all.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
well,
it's
not
even
that.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
i'm
going
to
tell
anyway
there's
no
penalty.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
no...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
y-
your
honor,
the
standard
is
knowingly
permit.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
your
honor,
i'd
assume
a
complaint
would
not
be
filed
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
pardon
me?
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
well,
your
honor,
it's
a
very
difficult
standard
to
satisfy,
knowingly
permit.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
well...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
yes,
of
course,
the
burden's
on
the
state.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
possibly.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
sometimes
doesn't
investigate
complaints
where
they
don't
have
sufficient
evidence
to
think
there's
even
a
basis...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
it's
conceivable,
your
honor,
but,
a-
again,
if
the...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
your
honor,
it's
kind
of
oblique.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
well,
the
your
honor,
you're
correct.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
what
the
petitioners
have
done
is,
they
have
refused
to
acknowledge
that
narrow
construction.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
in
the
petition.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
y-
your
honor,
in
their
petition,
though,
they
have
not
made
those
kinds
of
arguments
specifically
as...
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
they
have
in
the
reply
brief,
but
not
in
the
petition,
which
was
the
question
that
was
asked
previously.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
well,
your
i
don't
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i'm
not
a
proponent
of
what
of
that.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
well,
they
actually
do
advisory
opinions
over
the
phone,
your
honor,
on
very
short
order,
and
they
could
do
it
in
a
matter
of
of
hours
or
days,
depending
upon
what
the
needs
are.
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
are
you
asking
in
the
f-
mr.
alan
i.
gilbert
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
not
under
those
circumstances.
