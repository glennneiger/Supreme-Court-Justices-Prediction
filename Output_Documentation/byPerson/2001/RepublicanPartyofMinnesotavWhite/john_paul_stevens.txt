john
paul
stevens
may
may
he
also
at
the
same
time
as
he
criticized
the
decision,
say,
i
do
not
believe
in
stare
decisis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
isn't
he
saying
how
he's
going
to
rule
on
the
case...
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
imply
that
i
don't
believe
in
stare
decisis
and
i
think
this
case
is
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
long
as
you're
silent
on
your
views
on
stare
decisis,
that's
a
fine
distinction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
you're
saying
there's
a
distinction
between
issues
and
cases.
