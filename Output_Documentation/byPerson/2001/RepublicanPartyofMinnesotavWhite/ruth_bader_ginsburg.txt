justice
ruth
bader

because
see,
sitting
judge
could
not
be
restricted,
could
he
or
she,
in
a
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
gave
the
examples
for
your
one
of
the
briefs
gave
examples
of
commenting
on
specific
decisions
that
had
been
rendered
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court
and
you
said
that
restraint
on
that
comment
was
impermissable.
justice
ruth

am
i
not
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yeah.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
know
that
mm
do
we
is
there
any
mechanism
for
getting
clarification?
and
the
big
problem
in
this
case
is
this
is
a
frontal
attack,
and
so
we
have
no
specific
examples.
justice
ruth
bader

that
wouldn't
fit.
justice
ruth
bader

in
in
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked,
suppose
the
judge
said,
i
pledge
and
promise
that
if
you
elect
me,
i
will
vote
in
every
fourth
amendment
case
to
restore
the
law
to
what
it
was.
justice

go
on
that
to

justice

down
the
aba

the
aba

we're

they're
both
aba

justice

a
question
based
on
what
you
said
about
stare
decisis?
you
you
sa-
have
said
f-
consistently
you
can
discuss
your
judicial
philosophy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
so
you're
changing
back
then,
because
you
you
said
a
while
ago
that
stare
decisis
i-
if
you
said,
i
think
that
decision
about
the
fourth
amendment
was
wrong,
and
i
don't
believe
in
stare
decisis,
said
you
couldn't
put
those
two
together.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
certainly
did
in
the
reply
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gilbert,
you
brought
out
that
this
is
not
just
a
question
of
th-
the
candidate
informing
the
voter,
that
behind
all
of
this
is
a
litigant
who's
going
to
be
in
a
future
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
be
under
minnesota
law,
a
grounds
to
say,
i
don't
want
that
judge,
because
he's
announced
in
the
election
that
he's
tough
on
drunk
driving?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
also
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter,
and
breyer
have
joined.
whether
state
or
federal
elected
or
appointed,
judges
have
a
role
fundamentally
different
from
that
of
legislators
or
executive
officials.
judges
do
not
act
on
behalf
of
particular
persons,
communities,
or
parties,
they
serve
no
faction
or
constituency,
they
must
drive
to
do
what
is
legally
right
in
each
individual
case,
all
the
more
so,
to
borrow
the
chief
justice’s
words,
when
the
result
is
not
the
one
the
home
crowd
wants.
minnesota,
like
most
states
that
gives
citizens
a
voice
in
selecting
judges
has
installed
controls
enabling
the
public
to
comprehend
that
judges
speak
in
the
name
of
the
law
and
not
as
political
actors.
all
judicial
elections
in
minnesota
are
non-partisan.
candidates
may
not
seek
or
accept
endorsements
from
political
parties,
attend
political
gatherings,
or
identify
themselves
as
members
of
a
political
organization.
they
may
make
no
pledges
concerning
their
conduct
in
office
and
under
the
announce
clause,
at
issue
here,
they
may
not
publicize
how
they
would
decide
issues
likely
to
come
before
them
as
judges.
they
may,
however,
say
a
great
many
things
of
large
interest
to
voters;
they
may
convey
information
about
themselves
and
describe
their
conception
of
the
role
of
a
judge.
among
approved
topics
they
may
address
are
the
criteria
for
departing
from
the
sentencing
guidelines,
the
remedies
for
racial
and
gender
bias,
the
balance
between
free-speech
rights,
and
the
need
to
control
hate
crimes.
they
may
criticize
or
defend
past
decisions
of
any
court.
what
they
may
not
do
simply
or
with
sophistication
is
remove
themselves
from
the
constraints
characteristics
of
the
judicial
office
and
declare
how
they
would
decide
an
issue
without
regard
to
the
particular
context
in
which
it
is
presented
sounds
briefs
oral
argument,
and
as
to
an
appellant
bench,
the
benefit
of
their
colleague’s
analysis.
in
striking
down
the
announce
clause
the
court,
as
i
see
it,
grievously
errs
in
two
respects:
first,
in
homing
in
on
the
announce
clause,
the
court
scarcely
attendance
to
the
essential
differences
separating
judicial
office
from
political
seats.
if
minnesota
opts
to
elect
its
judges
the
court
suggests,
it
may
not
reign
in
what
candidates
say.
today’s
opinion
places
unqualified
reliance
on
prior
decisions
of
this
court
on
elections
for
legislative
and
executive
posts
including
the
case
with
the
words
from
justice
marshall
that
justice
scalia
just
quoted,
the
court
today
affords
no
clue
concerning
what
manner
of
judicial
campaign
regulations
might
survive
the
high
first
amendment
threshold
the
court
applies.
i
do
not
agree
that
an
election
is
an
election;
i
would
sharply
differentiate
elections
for
political
office,
in
which
the
first
amendment
holds
course
way,
from
elections
designed
to
select
those
whose
office
it
is
to
administer
justice
without
respect
to
persons.
minnesota
did
not
choose
a
judicial
election
system
with
all
the
trappings
of
legislative
and
executive
races,
while
providing
for
public
participation,
it
tailored
its
judicial
elections
to
fit
the
character
of
third
branch
office
holding.
the
balance
the
state
sought
to
achieve
allowing
the
people
to
elect
judges
but
safeguarding
the
process
so
that
the
integrity
of
the
judiciary
would
not
be
compromised
should
encounter
first
amendment
shawl
as
a
written
dissent
develops.
second,
the
court
fails
to
give
due
way
to
the
function
the
announce
clause
was
designed
to
serve,
together
with
the
companion
provision
prohibiting
candidates
from
making
pledges
or
promises
of
conduct
in
office,
a
provision,
all
parties
to
this
case
agree
is
constitutional,
the
announce
clause
aims
to
safeguard
judicial
impartiality
in
both
fact
and
appearance.
election-driven
commitment
to
certain
positions
however
common
place
and
races
for
the
political
branches,
are
incompatible
with
the
judicial
role.
they
compromise
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantee
of
due
process
of
law
for
they
place
pressure
on
the
judge
to
resist
the
pleas
of
litigants
who
make
arguments
the
judge
has
promised
to
reject.
judicial
campaign
commitments
also
undermine
the
very
source
of
the
judiciary’s
authority,
public
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
those
who
don
the
robe.
commitments
to
rule
this
way
or
that
convey
the
impression
of
unseemly
quid
pro
quo
the
judicial
candidate’s
promises
on
issues
in
return
for
the
electorate's
votes
at
the
polls.
such
an
exchange
inevitably
diminishes
the
public's
faith
in
the
capacity
of
judges
to
administer
the
law
without
regard
to
personal
or
political
self-interest.
working
in
tandem
with
the
announce
clause,
the
announce
clause
and
pledges
or
promises
prohibition
together,
goes
to
avert
peace
between
evils.
the
announce
clause
targets
statements
that
do
not
technically
qualify
as
pledges
or
promises
but
nevertheless
publicly
made
known
how
the
candidate
would
decide
legal
issues.
the
clause
thereby
prevents
what
would
otherwise
be
an
easy
end
run
around
the
letter
and
spirit
of
its
companion
provision.
without
the
announce
clause
in
other
words,
the
no-promises
or
pledges
clause
would
be
feeble
an
arid
form,
a
matter
of
no
real
importance.
judges
are
not
political
actors
and
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
that
they
be
treated
as
politicians
simply
because
they
are
elected.
for
more
than
three
quarters
of
the
century,
states
like
minnesota
have
endeavored
to
experiment
tested
by
experience
to
balance
the
strong
constitutional
interest
in
judicial
integrity
and
free
expression
within
the
unique
setting
of
an
elected
bench.
the
announce
clause,
borne
of
this
long
effort,
comes
to
this
court
bearing
a
weighty
title
of
respect.
in
accord
with
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit,
i
would
uphold
the
provision
as
an
essential
component
in
minnesota’s
accommodation
of
the
complex
and
competing
concerns
in
this
sensitive
area.
