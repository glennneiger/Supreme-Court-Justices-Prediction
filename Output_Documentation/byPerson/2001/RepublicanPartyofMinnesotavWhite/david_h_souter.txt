what...
justice
david
h.
souter
comment
on
on
a
ca-
by
a
candidate
who
is
not
yet
a
judge
on
a
case
which
is
then
pending
before
the
court?
in
in
your
view,
can
the
state
prohibit
the
candidate
from
saying,
i've
been
reading
about
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
a
comment?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
speeches?
you
mean
the
the
judge
could
could
go
out
and
a
sitting
judge
can
go
out
and
make
a
speech
and
say,
in
the
next
death
penalty
case
to
come
before
me,
i'm
going
to
vacate.
justice
david
h.
souter
then,
then
what
he
can
say
in
speeches
certainly
is
less
than
what
he
can
say
in
a
judicial
opinion
in
which
he
says,
i
vote
to
vacate
the
death
penalty
because
i
believe
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
david
h.
souter
gilbert,
do
you
do
you
think
we
should
draw
any
distinction,
or
whether
it
would
be
reasonable
for
us
to
draw
any
distinction,
between
the
the
application
of
the
rule
to
the
candidates
themselves
and
the
application
of
the
rule
to
all
of
these
ancillary
individuals
around
them
their
associates,
their
families?
let's
a-
let's
assume
that
we
say
that
the
rule
passes
muster
with
respect
to
the
candidate.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
we
figure,
you
know,
that's
how
you
get
the
message
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
say
limiting...
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the
family
member
says,
well
i'm
i'm
going
to
tell
anyway.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
could
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
know,
in
practical
terms,
what
happens.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean
are
are
opponents
just
forgiving
of
their
their
opponents
in
your
state?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
it's
difficult
to
satisfy.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
assume
that
there
could
be
a
complaint,
simply
based
on
the
emphatic
statement
of
the
spouse.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
he
knowingly
did
encourage.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
candidate
would
have
to
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
evidence
in
the
event
that
a
spouse
made
an
emphatic
statement
saying,
his
view
is,
or
her...
justice
david
h.
souter
something
from
the
board?
if
somebody
wants
to
give
a
speech
in
a
political
campaign,
i
assume
you
can't
get
a
twelve-hour
ruling
from
the
board.
