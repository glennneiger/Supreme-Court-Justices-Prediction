this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
there
is
a
long
tradition
in
this
country
of
the
states
selecting
their
judges
by
popular
election.
vermont
did
so
even
before
the
founding
of
the
union.
by
the
time
of
the
civil
war,
the
great
majority
of
the
states
did
so
and
they
continue
to
do
so
today.
minnesota
is
one
of
those
states.
ever
since
its
admission
to
the
union
in
1858,
the
minnesota
constitution
has
provided
for
the
selection
of
all
state
judges
by
popular
election.
beginning
in
1924,
the
american
bar
association
began
to
promulgate
model
codes
of
judicial
conduct
that
included
restrictions
on
what
candidates
for
judicial
office
could
say
during
their
election
campaigns.
the
states
slowly
adapted
these
restrictions
not
by
legislation
but
by
decree
of
state
supreme
courts.
one
of
these
restrictions
is
known
as
the
announce
clause
and
it
was
adapted
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court
in
1974.
the
announce
clause
prohibits
candidates
for
judicial
election
incumbent
judges
and
challengers
alike
from
“announcing
their
views
on
disputed
legal
or
political
issue”.
what
this
means
is
that
the
candidates
cannot
state
their
views
even
in
response
to
questions
on
any
specific
non-fanciful
legal
question
within
the
providence
of
the
courts
for
which
they
are
running.
indeed,
the
judicial
board
in
minnesota
has
printed
a
list
of
pre-approved
questions
which
judicial
candidates
are
allowed
to
answer.
these
include
how
the
candidate
feels
about
commerce
in
the
courtroom,
how
he
would
go
about
reducing
the
case
load,
and
how
the
court’s
cause
of
judicial
administration
could
be
reduced,
how
he
proposes
to
insure
that
minorities
and
women
are
treated
more
fairly
by
the
court
system.
petitioners
who
include
gregory
wersal,
an
erstwhile
candidate
for
associate
justice
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
sued
respondents,
several
state
officials
who
enforced
the
announce
clause,
seeking
a
declaration
of
the
clause
violates
the
first
amendment
and
an
injunction
against
its
enforcement.
the
district
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
clause
and
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
respondents.
the
eight
circuit
affirmed.
we
now
reverse.
the
announce
clause
is
a
content-based
regulation
that
burdens
a
category
of
speech
at
the
core
of
our
first
amendment
freedom’s;
speech
about
the
qualifications
of
candidates
for
public
office.
accordingly,
in
order
to
pass
constitutional
master,
the
clause
must
satisfy
our
strict
scrutiny
test.
under
this
test,
respondents
have
the
burden
to
prove
that
the
clause
is:
one,
narrowly
tailored
in
order
to,
number
two,
serve
a
compelling
state
interest.
respondents
assert
that
the
announce
clause
serves
two
compelling
state
interests,
namely:
preserving
the
impartiality
of
the
state
judiciary
and
preserving
the
appearance
of
that
impartiality.
under
any
definition
of
impartiality,
we
conclude
the
announce
clause
clearly
does
not
survive
strict
scrutiny.
the
traditional
meaning
of
impartiality
is
a
lack
of
bias
for
or
against
either
party
to
a
proceeding.
that
is
the
sentencing
which
the
term
is
used
when
the
cases
sighted
by
respondents
for
the
proposition
that
an
impartial
judge
is
essential
to
due
process.
it
is
obvious
that
the
announce
clause
is
not
narrowly
tailored
to
serve
either
this
sort
of
impartiality
or
its
appearance.
the
clause
does
not
restricts
speech
for
or
against
particular
parties
but
rather
speech
for
or
against
particular
issues.
to
be
sure
when
a
case
arises
that
turns
on
a
legal
issue
on
which
a
judge
as
a
candidate
has
taken
a
particular
stand,
the
party
taking
the
opposite
stand
is
likely
to
lose
but
not
because
of
any
bias
against
that
party.
any
party
taking
that
position
is
just
as
likely
to
lose.
another
possible
meaning
of
impartiality,
though
certainly
not
a
common
one,
is
the
lack
of
preconception
in
favor
or
against
a
particular
legal
view.
the
announce
clause
may
well
further
impartiality
in
this
sense,
but
it
is
obvious
that
achieving
this
sort
of
impartiality
is
not
a
compelling
state
interest.
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
find
a
judge
who
has
not
formed
at
least
some
tentative
answers
to
substantive
legal
questions.
indeed,
if
we
are
possible
to
find
judges
with
minds
that
were
empty
slates,
it
would
hardly
be
desirable
to
appoint
them.
this
brings
us
to
the
third
possible,
and
again
uncommon,
meaning
of
impartiality
namely
open-mindedness.
open-mindedness
demands
not
that
the
judge
have
no
pre-conceptions
on
legal
issues
but
that
he
would
be
willing
to
consider
opposing
views
and
remain
open
to
persuasion
when
the
issues
arise
in
a
pending
case.
respondents
argue
that
the
announce
clause
serves
the
interest
in
open-mindedness
or
at
least
its
appearance
because
it
relieves
a
judge
from
the
pressure
to
rule
a
certain
way
in
order
to
maintain
consistency
with
statements
he
has
previously
made.
we
need
not
decide
however,
whether
achieving
impartiality
in
this
sense
is
a
compelling
state
interest
because
we
do
not
believe
the
minnesota
supreme
court
adapted
the
announce
clause
in
order
to
serve
that
purpose.
statements
made
during
election
campaigns
are
an
infinitesimal
portion
of
the
public
commitments
to
legal
positions
that
judges
or
would
be
judges
undertake.
before
they
arrive
on
the
bench
and
even
more
frequently
while
they
are
on
the
bench,
candidates
and
judges
commit
themselves
on
legal
issues
that
they
must
later
rule
upon.
under
the
announce
clause,
a
candidate
for
judicial
office
may
not
say,
i
think
it
is
unconstitutional
for
the
legislature
to
prohibit
same
sex
marriages,
but,
he
may
say
the
very
same
thing
up
until
the
day
before
he
declares
himself
to
be
a
candidate,
and
he
may
say
it
repeatedly
after
he
is
elected.
as
a
means
of
pursuing
the
objective
of
open-mindedness,
the
announce
clause
is
willfully
under
inclusive
as
to
render
belief
in
that
purpose
a
challenge
to
the
credulous.
the
dissenters
say
that
statements
made
during
the
campaign
are
different,
that
they
are
somehow
specially
binding
on
the
judge.
well,
that
might
be
true
with
regard
to
campaign
promises.
i
promise
i
will
rule
such
and
such
way
if
elected.
i
say
that
may
be
true;
i
think
you
have
to
be
a
little
naïve
to
think
that
campaign
promises
are
among
more
binding
of
human
legal
commitments,
but
it
might
be
true
with
regard
to
campaign
promises.
but
the
minnesota
supreme
court
has
adapted
a
separate
prohibition
on
campaign
pledges
and
promises,
which
is
not
challenged
here.
so
even
if
one
believes
that
campaign
promises
are
specially
binding,
that
would
not
justify
the
announce
rule.
the
dissenters
also
say
that
our
opinion
today
assumes
that
judicial
elections
and
elections
for
the
political
branches
must
be
governed
by
the
same
rules.
we
say
no
such
things.
there
can
be
different
rules.
but
as
our
cases
have
long
held,
any
such
rules
that
prevent
the
expression
of
views
must
be
narrowly
tailored
to
serve
a
compelling
state
interest,
and
that
requirement
has
not
been
met
here.
there
is
an
obvious
tension
between
the
provision
of
the
minnesota
constitution
that
requires
the
election
of
all
state
judges
and
the
minnesota
supreme
court’s
announce
clause
which
places
most
subjects
of
interest
to
the
voters,
who
elect
judges,
off
limits.
the
disparity
is
perhaps
unsurprising
since
the
american
bar
association
which
originated
the
announce
clause
has
long
been
an
opponent
of
judicial
election.
then
opposition
may
be
well-taken,
but
the
first
amendment
does
not
permit
it
to
achieve
its
goals
by
leaving
the
principle
of
elections
in
place
while
preventing
candidates
from
discussing
what
the
elections
are
about.
we
have
never
allowed
the
government
to
prohibit
candidates
from
communicating
relevant
information
to
voters
during
an
election,
and
we
do
not
begin
doing
so
today.
i
will
conclude
this
summary
as
i
concluded
the
analytical
portion
of
the
opinion
with
a
quotation
from
justice
marshall
--
the
second
justice
marshall
not
the
first
--
in
a
related
case,
thurgood
marshall
wrote,
"the
greater
power
to
dispense
with
elections
all
together
does
not
include
the
lesser
power
to
conduct
elections
under
conditions
of
state-imposed
voter
ignorance.
if
the
state
chooses
to
tap
the
energy
and
the
legitimizing
power
of
the
democratic
process,
it
must
accord
the
participants
in
that
process
the
first
amendment
rights
that
attach
to
their
roles."
