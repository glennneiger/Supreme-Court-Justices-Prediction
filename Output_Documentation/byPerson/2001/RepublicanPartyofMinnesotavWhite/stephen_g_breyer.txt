justice
stephen
g.
breyer
from
that?
that
is,
i
read
through
the
minnesota
bar
association's
brief,
the
aba's
brief,
and
portions
of
the
brennen
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right?
they
all
suggested
to
me
that
this
ethical
rule,
like
all
ethical
rules,
is
vague,
interpreted
by
interpretive
opinions,
of
which
there
are
many.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
what
they're
trying
to
do
do
you
agree
that
is
what
this's
trying
to
do?
and,
second,
if
that
is
what
they're
trying
to
do,
why
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
to
your
mind...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
all
the
things
you
can
discuss,
judicial
philosophy,
character,
this
and
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
am,
why
does
the
constitution
forbid
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
i
told
you
what
it
means.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
you're
saying
the
word
is
announce,
and
all
these
briefs
and
the
bar
association
are
wrong
when
they
say
that
means
commit
or
appear
to
commit,
on
that
view,
what
should
i
do
with
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
follow
that
up
for
one
second?
all
right,
now
take
the
other
assumption.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
is
it
constitutional,
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
think
the
aba
canon
is,
itself,
unconstitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
you
s-
misspoke
i
think
you
you...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who
is
not
a
judge,
can
criticize
the
specific
decision
of
the
judge
who
wrote
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
equally
free
at
the...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
specific
past
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ask
you
this
question...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that
i've
two
questions,
really.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
would
happen
if,
instead
of
my
being
in
the
senate,
i
had
been
in
an
election
campaign,
and
i
was
trying
to
draw
this
very
line
between
s-
commitments
to
future
cases,
specific
ones,
and
general
judicial
philosophy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
i
then
suppose
i
won.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
what
are
the
consequences?
it
is,
after
all,
an
ethical
rule,
and
ethical
rules
are
often
blurry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
want
to
know
what
would
likely
happen
to
a
person
who
makes
a
mistake
in
drawing
this
very
fine
line,
assuming
that
it's
in
good
faith.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
one
other...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
a
technical
question,
but
the
the
sentence
you
started
out
reading
from
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
not
identical
to
the
aba
canon.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
i
assume
that,
in
fact,
minnesota
does
mean
it's
indistinguishable
from
the
mi-
aba
canon,
which
is
what
the
aba
says?
or
what
your
opponent
says?
how
do
i
deal
with
that...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
actually
found
that
when
they
approached
a
particular
case
about
how
you
were
going
to
decide
in
the
future,
both
the
senators
in
my
experience,
and
since
it
only
concerns
me
would
not
press
the
issue
of
how
you
would
decide
a
particular
case.
