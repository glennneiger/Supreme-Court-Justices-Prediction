mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
like
most
states
minnesota
selects
its
judges
through
periodic
popular
elections.
and
when
candidates'
speech
is
severely
restricted,
the
peoper
[:
people]
are
denied
access
to
the
information
they
need
to
make
an
informed
choice.
while
state
court
judges
are
different
from
other
elected
officials,
minnesota's
announce
clause,
as
now
interpreted
by
its
supreme
court,
goes
too
far
resulting
in
elections
without
campaign.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
ye-
i-
yes,
justice
o'connor.
the
announce
clause
c-
prohibits,
according
to
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit,
any
general
dis-
allows
general
discussions
of
the
law,
while
it
prohibits
any
implying
of
how
a
person
would
rule
a
candidate
would
rule,
on
an
issue
or
case
before
the
court.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
the
predges
[:
pledges]
and
promises
clause
prohibits
any
pledge
or
promise
that
other
than
faithful
performance
of
duties
in
office.
the
difference
between
announce,
the
plain
language
of
the
clause,
and
pledge
or
promise
announce
is
simply
making
known,
is
one
of
the
formulations
of
the
eighth
circuit,
or
implying
while
pledging
or
promising
is
making
a
commitment
on
how
you
would
rule
in
a
future
case.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
there
is
one
aspect
of
the
current
nineteen
ninety
aba
can-
n-
canon
that
has
was
not
discussed
by
the
ninth
circuit
or
by
the
aba
brief.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
and
that...
and
where...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i
do
not
have
a
reference
to
the
aba
canon,
your
honor.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
it
it
did,
your
it...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
one
of
the
problems,
your
honor,
is
that
the
january
twenty-ninth
opinion
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
interpreting
the
announce
clause
adopted
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
and
and
its
interpretations.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
unfortunately,
the
eighth
circuit
had
conflicting
statements
about
the
scope
of
the
of
the
interpretation
that
it
was
announcing.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
we
are.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
we
did,
as
to
the
interpretation
proffered
in
the
district
court,
adding
the
words
likely
to
come
before
the
court.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
canon,
even
though
it
was
not
advocated
by
any
of
the
parties.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
we
did.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no,
but
it
is
encompassed
within
the
v-
violation
of
the
first
amendment
that
we
alleged.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
in
the
context
of
first
amendment
protected
speech,
a
a
a
something
that
chills
first
amendment
speech,
but
because
of
it
is
a
vague
rur-
rule
and
therefore
does
not
provide
a
bright
line
necessary
for
the
exercise
of
that
speech,
that
it
it
constitutes
a
first
amendment
violation.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
that
is
one
of
the
three...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
it
is
not
the
narrowest,
your
honor,
because
it
uses
the
word
issue.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
in
the
eighth
circuit
case
where
they
use
the
word
decide
a
case,
such
as
on
page
forty-five
a
of
the
petition
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no,
and
but
i
believe
that
this
canon
does
apply
to
judges
once
they
er
are
elected
and
on
the
bench.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no,
they
may
be
limited
in
a
number
of
different
ways,
your
honor,
that
are
are
necessary
to
advance
compelling
interests.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
well
your
honor,
the
first
amendment
applied
has
its
most
urgent
application
in
campaigns
for
for
elections,
and
it
is
ne-
and
while
ju-
both
judges
and
judicial
candidates
may
be
limited
in
their
speech,
it
has
never
been
held
that
simply
announcing
your
views
on
a
disputed
legal
or
political
issue
constitutes
a
eh-
an
indication
of
partiality
such
that
would
justify,
for
instance,
recusal
or...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
the-
then
i
then
i
i
then
i
misspoke,
is
that
if
that
was
your...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
canon
four
and
in
c-
fact,
canon
four
b
of
the
minnesota
canons
encourages
judges
to
propose
changes
in
the
substantive
and
procedural
law,
even
individually.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
we
believe
that
they
should.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
sitting
judges
are
restricted,
for
instance,
from
commenting
on
pending
cases
that
are
pending
before
them,
quite
properly.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
believe
that
that
can...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
that
that
is
our...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
i
the
first
amendment
protects
discussion
of
p-
past
cases.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
opinions.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
under
the
announce
clause?
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
not
if
it's
considered
implying
how
you
would
rule
in
a
future
case.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
you
can
seek
a
private
advisory
opinion
that
is
not
binding
on
either
the
office
or
the
board.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
not
only
to
candidates,
but
this
canon
binds
the
family
members,
the
sup-
supporters
of
the
candidate.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
n-
n-
no,
your
honor,
and
if
i
gave
you
that
impression,
i...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
the
rule
is
the
same.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
there're
specific...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
canons
that...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
that.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
and
and
that's
approp-
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
appropriate
limit.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
it
is
in
the
realm
of
p-
pledges
and
promises.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no,
that
c-
that
is
allowed,
your
honor,
because
he's
not
promising
certain
results
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
then
that
is
a
pledge
or
promise
of...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
because
there
is
a...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
there's
a
le-
a
public
perception
of
the
impartiality
of
the
judiciary
that
i
think
properly
can
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
and
i
think
this
rule
announces
a
rule
that
is
consistent
with
the
judge
judge's
obligation
to
decide
cases
in
accordance
with...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
he
is
not,
under
th-
the
well,
to
the
extent
that
we
know
what
the
announce
clause
means...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
with
this
conflicting
formulations
under
the
eighth
circuit
opinion,
talking
about
cases
or
issues
talking
about,
implying,
or
making
known
to
the
extent
that
we
know
the
rule,
it
would
appear
that
such
a
statement
would
be
prohibited...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
it
would
imply
what
he
would
rule
in
the
future.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no,
i'd
say
the
first
amendment
protects
talking
about
prior
decisions.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
is
we're
talking
about
the
rule
the
minnesota
rule
versus...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
other
proposed
rules.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
there
would
there
would
seem
to
be,
under
gentile,
more
leeway
for
a
lawyer
not
in
a
pending
case
to
discuss
a
pending
case.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i
think
i
think
it
could
not
be
prohibited.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
that
is
a
classic
pledge
and
promise
that
i
think
can
be
appropriately
prohibited
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
both
to
issues
and
and...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
mhm.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
and
i...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i-
if
it
amounts
to
a
pledge
or
a
promise...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
if
if
the
word
commit
means
pledge,
then
i
think
you're...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
what
is
wrong
with
it...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
an-
what
is
wrong
wrlong
[:
wrong]
with
it
is
that
the
aba
suggested
that
commit
means
the
same
thing
as
announce.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
you
should
strike
down
the
announce
clause,
because
it
it
is
impossible
hopelessly
impossible
to
know
what
is
included
within
the
rule
and
what
is
outside
the
rule.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
an
issue,
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no,
because
of
the
appear
to
commit
language.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
a-
as
i
as
i
interpret
it,
yes,
because
the
appear
to
commit
takes
us
back
away
from
a
bright
line
of
a
pledge
or
a
promise
into
the
realm
of
implying
what
you
are
saying.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
th-
they
they
are
not
in
favor
of...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i
believe
that
they
can,
your
honor,
because
the
because
judges
have
a
dual
role.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no
a
the
th-
the
no
it
no
it
may
not...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
but
that
is
but
that
is
different
from
declaring
declaring
or
announcing
that
you
are
have
a
closed
mind
as
to
any...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
it
it
it...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
very
difficult
to
know,
your...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
u-
un-
under
under
our
rule,
it
would
be
allowed.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
the
minnesota
rule
if
you
simply
imply
how
you
might
rule...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
y-
yes,
it...
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
a
judge
to
do
that
in
an
opinion
or
in
speeches
or
a
lar
[:
law]
review
articles.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
not
that
statement.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
pledge
rule.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
y-
yes,
i
i
would
think
he
would.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
this's
a
matter
of
mathematical
precision.
