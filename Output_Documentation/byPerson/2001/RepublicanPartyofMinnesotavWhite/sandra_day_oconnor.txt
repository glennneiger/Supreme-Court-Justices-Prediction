justice
sandra
day

could
we
find
out
from
you
just
what
the
announce
clause
prohibits
that
isn't
already
prohibited
by
the
pledges
and
promises
clause,
as
it's
been
interpreted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
does
that
differ,
then,
from
the
pledges
or
promises
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
think
the
announce
clause,
even
as
interpreted
by
the
eighth
circuit
to
be
the
same
as
the
aba
canon,
goes
beyond
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
eighth...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
say
that
it
was
that
minnesota's
provision
is
the
same
as
the
aba
canon,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
aba
canon
re-
prohibits
candidates,
judicial
candidates,
from
making
statements
that
commit
or
appear
to
commit
the
candidate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
looks
very
much
like
the
pledge
or
promise
language.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you're
you
s-
appear
to
be
arguing,
in
your
brief
at
least,
that
the
announce
clause
is
unconstitutionally
vague,
is...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
your
making?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
did
you
make
that
argument
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
didn't
include
a
vagueness
challenge
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
did
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
in
the
question
on
which
we
granted
cert,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thought
vagueness
was
a
first
amendment
issue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
this
play
out
with
sitting
judges
who
write
opinions
saying,
in
my
view,
for
example,
i
think
the
death
penalty
is
unconstitutional?
there
it
is
for
everybody
to
see.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
judge
has
expressed
a
view
that
presumably
the
judge
will
follow
in
a
future
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
know,
if
it's
thoroughly
expressed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
pages?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
have
them...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
such
a
problem
to
know
exactly
what
the
provision
covers
now.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
pr-
is
that
part
of
the
canon
part
of
the
question
in
this
case?
i
know
it's
part
of
the
canon.
