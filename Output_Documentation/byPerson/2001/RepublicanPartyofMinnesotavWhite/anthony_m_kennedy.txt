w-
one
of
the
statements
that
the
eighth
circuit
and
i
don't
have
the
citation
to
the
brief
i
have
the
citation
to

justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
could
d-
d-
d-
would
you
agree
that
that's
perhaps
the
narrowest
of
the
th-
three
constructions?
i
w-
i
want
to
find
wh-
what
might
be
the
most
likely
statement
to
survive
review
and
then
have
you
discuss
that,
because
i
i
take
it
you
would
not
be
you
w-
you
would
not
agree
that
even
that
is
constitutional.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
take
the
let's
take
the
last
one.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
w-
w-
would
you
agree
th-
that
that
would
be
a
constitutional
standard
if
it
were
part
of
a
code
of
judicial
ethics
that
applied
to
the
judge
after
the
judge
was
on
the
bench?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
uh-huh
well,
are
judges,
after
they
are
on
the
bench,
subject
to,
have
all
of
the
same
rights
they
have
before
they
go
on
the
bench,
insofar
as
making
public
comments?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
uh-huh
well,
why
why
is
it
that,
i-
if
th-
an
election
is
in
july,
the
state
can,
under
your
view,
not
prohibit
statements
in
june
before
he's
elected,
but
they
can
prohibit
the
statements
in
august,
after
he's
elected?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still
want
to
make
clear
your
your
posi-
your
position
is
is
that
the
judge
can,
after
the
judge's
election,
be
disciplined,
sanctioned
for
certain
remarks
that
he
could
not
be
sanctioned
bef-
for
before
the
election.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
other
words,
the
rule...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
post
and
pre
election
that
have
r-
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
speak
are
the
same.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
it
it's
just
then
your
position
is
it
i-
is
that
there
is
a
difference
as
it
applies
to
pending
cases
as
to
which
a
sitting
judge
has
to
to
which
a
sitting
judge
has
been
assigned.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
limits
on
what
a
candidate
can
say?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
are
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
he
said,
there
are
a
lot
of
criminal
cases
pending,
and,
to
take
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical,
we've
gone
too
far
in
interpreting
the
fourth
amendment,
and
i'm
going
to
be
more
strict.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
view
that
could
be
prohibited.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
these
cases
bef-
come
before
me,
this
is
what
i'll
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
your...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
can
be
prohibited.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
surprised
you
take
that
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
w-
w-
but
but
you're
y-
you're
submitting
this
case
to
us
on
the
proposition
that,
under
the
first
amendment,
a
judicial
candidate
can
be
subjected
to
s-
restraints
on
speech
that
other
cand-
that
are
inapplicable
to
other
candidates.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
says,
this
is
the
worst
decision
that's
come
down
since
dred
scott,
it's
it's
a
a
plague
on
our
people,
it's
an
insult
to
the
system,
but
i'm
not
telling
you
how
i'll
vote.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
reading?
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
volume
one
of
the...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
but
but
is...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
statement
at
page
thirty-six
that
you
read
is
that
proscribable
under
the
state's
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
a...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
violation
of
the
provisions
you
describe
a
criminal
offense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
state
do
it
under
the
first
amendment?
is
there
any
authority
you
have
for
the
proposition,
that
can
a
a
state
can
impose
a
civil
sanction,
but
not
a
criminal
sanction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
my
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
authority
that
a
state,
under
the
first
amendment,
is
free
to
impose
a
civil
sanction
but
not
a
criminal
sanction
on
particular
speech?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
that
indicates
an
disqualification
or
a
lack
of
temperament
for
the
bench,
the
voters
can
decide
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
said
what
kind
of
judges
they
want.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
don't
trust
the
electorate
of
minnesota
to
decide
where
their
judge
has
judicial
temperament.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
we
do
not
allow
the
state
to
presume
that
the
public
is
better
off
not
having
complete
information.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
should
know
about
this
judge's
temperament.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
fu-
you're
saying
the
public
doesn't
know
enough
in
order
to
to
to
determine
whether
a
judge
has
the
requisite
qualifications
for
office.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
