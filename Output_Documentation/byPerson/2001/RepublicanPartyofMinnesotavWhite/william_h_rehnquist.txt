chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
on
number
oh
one
five
twenty-one,
the
republican
party
of
minnesota,
et
al.,
versus
verna
kelly.
mr.
bopp...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
s-
s-
supposing
that
a
c-
supposing
that
minnesota
the
minnesota
supreme
court
had
announced
that
its
fourth
amendment
was
more
protective
than
the
federal
fourth
amendment
and
a
candidate
running
for
that
courts
saw
that
several
cases,
the
evidence
had
been
suppressed
in
minnesota
courts,
the
defendant
was
acquitted,
so
he
said,
i
think
we
should
go
back
to
the
idea
that
our
fourth
amendment
is
the
same
as
the
federal
fourth
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
announce
clau-
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
an
extremely
fine
line
you're
drawing,
it
seems
to
me,
because
i
think
a
moment
ago,
in
response
to
my
question,
you
said
that
a
candidate
would
be
prohibited,
and
wrongly
prohibited,
under
y-
your
view
on
your
your
view
of
the
thing
from
saying
that
minnesota
should
adopt
the
fe-
federal
fourth
amendment
standard
rather
than
the
more
liberal
fourth
amendment
standard
that
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
hypothetically
had
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
an-
you
an-
y-
an-
you
say
that
the
first
amendment
prohibits
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a-
what
if
a
candidate
says
not,
i
pledge
that
in
every
case
i
will
say
vote
against
the
death
penalty,
but,
that
i
have
real
doubts
about
the
death
penalty
jurisprudence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
assume
it
does.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
minnesota
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereabouts
on
the
page?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
example
i
posed
to
your
your
opponent?
someone
says,
i
think
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
ruling
on
the
fourth
amendment,
as
i-
the
state
fourth
amendment
being
broader,
i-
is
is
wrong,
and
i
i
i
th-
if
if
you
will
el-
elect
me
as
a
judge,
i
would
try
to
change
that
around.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
i-
i-
let
me
put...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
the
test.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
say
anything
more
than...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
my
example?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
dichotomy
make
any
sense
at...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
a
s-
a
judge
can't
have
an
o-
an
opinion...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
hearing
from
all
sides
and
going
in
briefs
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
even
if
he
gives
a
speech,
does
he
have
to
first
have
this
sort
of
vetting?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
should
go
before
the
senate...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bopp,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bopp.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-521,
republican
party
of
minnesota
versus
white
