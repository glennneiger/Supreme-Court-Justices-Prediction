i-
i
take
it
that
the
first
part
of
your
argument
as
demonstrated
is
to
try
to
show
that
there
are
certain
in-
indexes,
indicia
of
neutrality.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
tick
them
off.

just,
before
we
leave
the
community
schools,
when
the
state
calculates
the
funding
that
goes
to
the
community
schools,
it
takes
account
of
the
number
of
students
that
go
to
the
community
schools,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
figure
of
something
like
five
thousand
dollars...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
per
student
not
quite
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
part
of
the
design
of
the
program
is
to
have
a
structure
which
will
encourage
over
the
long
term
more
and
different
kinds
of
school
choices,
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course
the
community
schools...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
neutrality
in
this
program,
and
it
t-
s-
seems
to
me
that
if
you
ask
us
to
put
on
blinders,
and
and
not
inquire
as
to
what's
really
happening
into
cincinnati,
what
really
was
the
reason
for
this,
what
all
of
the
choices
are,
that
you're
asking
us
to
make
a
decision
b-
based
on
on
a
fictional
premise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
asking
us
to
look
at
part
of
a
reality.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
doing
a
very
good
job
of
not
answering...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
o'connor's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
[inaudible]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
it's
very
clear
to
me
that
ohio
had
that
option.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
scalia
put
the
point
that
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
have
a
structure
in
which
different
school
systems,
different
curriculums,
curriculums
that
do
not
inflict
terminal
boredom
on
students,
can
begin
to
flourish,
and
the
question
is,
how
can
they
do
that
in
the
long
term,
and
you
say
they
cannot
do
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
frankel,
may
i
may
i
ask
you,
has
the
have
the
ohio
courts
ever
passed
upon
on
on
this
question?
i
know
they
they
they
passed
on
the
on
the
the
single
iss-
single
statement
i-
issue
under
the
constitution.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
issue
before
the
ohio
courts
when
they
passed
on
the
single
issue
m-
matter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
fact
that
it
issued
the
obiter
indicated
that
it
was
not
concerned
with
the
point
that
you're
now
making,
and
that's
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
point
that
you
that
you're
now
addressing
to
us.
