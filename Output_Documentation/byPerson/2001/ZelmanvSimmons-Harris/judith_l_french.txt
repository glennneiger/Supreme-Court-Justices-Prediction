judith
l.

thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
nineteen
ninety-five,
the
ohio
general
assembly
responded
to
an
unprecedented
educational
crisis
by
enacting
the
ohio
scholarship
and
tutorial
program.
under
this
court's
decisions,
especially
mueller,
witters,
and
zobrest,
and
in
light
of
this
court's
teachings,
most
recently
in
agostini
and
mitchell,
the
ohio
program
is
constitutional
because
it
offers
a
neutral
program
that
offers
true
private
choice
to
parents.
first,
the
principle
of
neutrality.
there
are
two
criteria
that
determine
where
the
benefits
will
go
under
the
program.
first
is
residence
in
a
school
district
that
is
or
has
been
taken
over
by
state
control.
second
is
family
income.
neither
of
these
criteria
has
anything
to
do
with
religion,
but
even
beyond
these
basic...
ms.
judith
l.
french
elements...
well,
do
you
you
don't
take
the...
ms.
judith
l.
french
we
ha-
have
a
two-pronged
approach
and
that...
ms.
judith
l.
french
we
do,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
but
it
certainly
goes
to
the
neutrality
of
the
program,
ms.
judith
l.
french
we,
of
course,
your
honor,
do
not
agree
that
they're
proselytizing.
ms.
judith
l.
french
an-
and
talk
about
the
true
private
choice
that
is
at
issue
here
for
the...
ms.
judith
l.
french
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
well,
there
are
fifty-seven
thousand
students
elementary
students
in
the
in
the
in
the
cleveland
school
district,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
i-
in
nineteen
ninety-nine
the
number
was
thirty-seven
hundred.
ms.
judith
l.
french
but
all
the
students
in
the
s-
cleveland
school
district
are
eligible.
ms.
judith
l.
french
not
necessary,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
that's
currently
true,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
very
much
so,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
there
would
be
no
tuition
assistance,
your
honor,
only
because
they
are
public
schools,
so
there's
no
need
for
a
scholarship
there
parents
can
choose
a
traditional
public
school,
they
can
choose
a
tutoring
grant
if
they're
in
a
if
they're
in
a
public
school,
they
can
choose
a
magnet
school,
they
can
choose
a
community
school,
or...
ms.
judith
l.
french
they
have,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
more
money,
and
in
part
because
of
the
uncertainty
of
the
litigation.
ms.
judith
l.
french
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
spots...
ms.
judith
l.
french
available
in
both...
ms.
judith
l.
french
yes,
your
honor,
you
can.
ms.
judith
l.
french
i
would
direct
the
court
to
two
places
in
the
record,
particularly
the
joint
appendix.
ms.
judith
l.
french
there
is
to
to
the
first
part
of
your
question,
your
honor,
and
that's
in
mr.
puckett's
affidavit,
of
just
describing
what
the
schools
are,
why
we
have
them
in
ohio.
ms.
judith
l.
french
there're
there
are
a
number
of
studies
that
have
been
done
both
in
cleveland
and
with
respect
to
other
pro-
other
scholarship
pr-
programs,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
yes,
your
honor,
in
general
the
scholarship
program,
not
just
specifically
the
religious
schools,
but
the
voucher
er
the
scholarship
program
as
a
whole,
ms.
judith
l.
french
as
to
whether
the
students
are
showing
academic
achievement
or,
you
know,
significant
results
beyond
that.
ms.
judith
l.
french
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
ms.
judith
l.
french
yes.
ms.
judith
l.
french
right.
ms.
judith
l.
french
approximately.
ms.
judith
l.
french
it
does
point
the
other
way,
your
honor,
but
we
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
distinctions
which
this
court
has
drawn
between
the
programs
at
issue,
say,
in
mueller
and
witters
that
distinguish
it
from
the
new
york
program
at
issue
in
nyquist.
ms.
judith
l.
french
well,
this
court
has
pointed
to
specifically
footnote
thirty-eight,
where
the
court
reserved
judgment
in
the
nyquist
decision
for
programs
that
offered
a
benefit,
the
specific
example
was
scholarships
there,
and
offered
to
a
broad
base
of
beneficiaries
without
regard
to
the
nonpublic
or
public
or
nonsectarian,
sectarian
nature
of
the
institutions
benefited
which
is
precisely
precisely
what
is
happening
here.
ms.
judith
l.
french
we,
of
course,
disagree,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
massive
amount
going
to
religious
schools
as
a
result
of
something
that
the
government
is
doing.
ms.
judith
l.
french
well,
in
that
respect,
your
honor,
there's
no
question
that
there
is
money
that
is
ending
up
in
religious
institutions,
because
that's
what
the
what
the
parents
have
chosen,
but
that
nondiscrimination
provision
that
i
spoke
of
earlier
did
not
exist
in
nyquist.
ms.
judith
l.
french
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
i
would
suggest
witters,
your
honor,
because
it's
a
financial
aid
going
to
there
it
was
a
college
student,
but
an
adult,
to
make
a
decision
about
where
to
send
the
money.
ms.
judith
l.
french
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
in
mueller
the
court
did
address
that
concern,
as
justice
powell
said
in
his
concurrence
in
witters
that
it
didn't
matter
that
there
was
only
one
person,
mr.
witters,
using
the
money
for
seminary,
for
the
inland
empire
school
of
the
bible,
nor
did
it
matter
in
zobrest
that
there
was
only
one
child
or
one
parent
set
of
parents
for
a
child
looking
for
an
interpretive
or
religious
school.
ms.
judith
l.
french
the
parents,
of
course,
did,
ms.
judith
l.
french
i
disagree,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
four
points.
ms.
judith
l.
french
they
are
considered
public
schools,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
they
do.
ms.
judith
l.
french
they
ar-
they
do
have...
ms.
judith
l.
french
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
yes,
your
honor,
and
it
does
have
the
same
sorts
of
financial
requirements.
ms.
judith
l.
french
schools
do
not...
ms.
judith
l.
french
and
and
in
answer
to
your
question
earlier
to
mr.
chanin,
it's
open
to
all-comers.
