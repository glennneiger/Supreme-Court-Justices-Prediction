mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
it
had
n-
nothing
to
do
with
that
case.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
for
this
reason.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
it
should
stay...
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
will
be
an
appropriate
resolution
for
the
interests
of
ohio
and
its
poor
children.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i'm
sorry.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
there
is
mostly
anecdotal
material
comparing
the
kind
of
job
that's
done
in
parochial
and
secular
schools.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
with
deference,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
difficulties
that
i'm
trying
to
suggest
about
the
court's
getting
into
the
details
of
some
of
the
establishment
clause
cases
that
have
been
mooted
here
are
avoided
by
looking
what
is
said
to
be
a
comparison
between
parochial
schools
and
public
schools.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
problem
of
c-
comparative
qualities
changes
quite
markedly,
and
you
don't
have
the
same
kind
of
problem.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
your
honor,
th-
it
sort
of
slipped
by
but
we
we
made
the
further
point
that
le-
let
me
put
it
this
way.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
on
the
establishment
clause,
i
should
add
we
are
as
one
with
our
friends
here.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
didn't
we
didn't
think
we
had
any...
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
won
the
lawsuit.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
and
we
didn't
believe
i
still
don't
believe
we
had
occasion
to
do
that.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
ohio
supreme
court,
your
honor,
in
what
we
considered
obiter,
said
it
it
found
consistency
with
the
establishment
clause,
but
it
had
already
held
its
statute
unconstitutional
on
state
grounds,
so
we
never
could
reach
that.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i-
it
was
not
concerned
with...
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
your
honor,
it
it
it
didn't
take
proper
concern
of
everything
that
we
thought
it
it
sh-
should
have
looked
at.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
thank
you,
your
honor.
