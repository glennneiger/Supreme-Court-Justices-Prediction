mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
perhaps,
justice
stevens,
i
might,
but
this
does
i-
this
th-
as
this
court
has
taught
repeatedly,
the
background
history
and
the
context
informs
the
decision
which
this
court
has
endorsed
with
respect
to
what
the
effects
or
endorsement
test
would
be,
measured
by
what
a
reasonable,
objective
observer
would
believe
the
state
or
the
government
was
doing.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
what
what
i
w-
i
would
d-
invite
the
court's
attention
to
page
forty-one
of
the
taylor
petitioner's
brief,
which
contains
a
chart
which
shows
the
various
choices
which
were
made
available
to
the
students
as
a
result
of
the
composite,
the
context
of
the
program
that
we're
considering.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
i...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
i
stand
corrected.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
an-
and
th-
and
the
record
is
quite
clear
on
this,
also.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
no,
no.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
absolutely,
but
the
record
here
in
goes
even
further
than
that,
because
the
record
that
is
available
shows
these
many
alternatives.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
that
is
the...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
court
made
a
m-
a
legal
error
in
failing
to
do
so,
because
this
court
has
taught
over
and
over
again
that
the
context
is
extremely...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
it
affects
both
the
amount
of
money
to
be
given
and
the
preference.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
that's
always
the
case,
of...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
government
program,
but
the
priorities
are
given
to
the
low
income
people.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
but
the
court
has
made
the
made
the
point
in
connection
with
those
types
of
programs
that
there's
a
significant
difference
between
a
direct
aid
program,
where
funds
are
going
from
the
government
to
the
school,
as
opposed
to
the
private
cho-
p-
genuinely
independent,
purely
private
choice
programs
where
the
choices
are
being
made
by
individual
parents,
and
meing
[:
being]
being
made
by
individual
parents
motivated
by
the
best
education
for
their
children.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
applying
the
k-
the
standards
this
court
has
adopted,
that
th-
the
euv-
if
the
n-
criteria
are
neutral
and
i'm
answering
i
mak-
i'm
saying...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
which
we're
we're
also
offeri-
an-
the...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
if
there
was
a
purely
neutral
criteria
in
terms
of
eligibility
for
the
program,
and
it's
a
purely
private
choice,
that
the
in-
that
the
because
this
court
has
emphasized
that
we're
looking
at
whether
the
government's
being
going
going
to
be
perceived
by
a
reasonable
observer
as
endorsing
religion,
if
it
is
a
purely
private
choice
program,
the
teaching
of
this
court
is,
it's
not
unlike
a
government
check
that
goes
to
an
indiv-
a
g-
an
individual
who
then
spends
it,
all
of
it
on...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
would
i
would
probably
be
making
that
argument
in
another
case.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that
what
this
court
has
taught,
that
because
these
establishment
clause
cases
are
so
difficult,
that
they
are
made
in
the
context
of
the
particular
facts
of
the
case,
and
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
history
illuminate
what
the
government
was
involved
in,
because
we're
not
talking
about...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
same
factor
in
the
mueller
case,
an
and
and
one
of
the
other
cases
that
wer-
that
wa-
that
was
that
has
been
cited,
the
court
said
that
is
not
of
constitutional
significance.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
tho-
those
choices
this
court
has
said
are
are
the
result
of
purely
private
choices,
and
that
that
will
not
be
associated
by
a
reasonable
observer
with
a
governmental
decision.
