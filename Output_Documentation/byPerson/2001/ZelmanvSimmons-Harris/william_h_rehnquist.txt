that

if

if
if
a

unconstitutional,
the

of

is
on
that

it,

chief

william

rehnquist
well
but
wha-
why
why
is
there
a
the
bright
line
that
you
talk
about
w-
which
separates
community
schools
from
private
schools
e-
and
aligns
them
with
o-
other
than
the
fact
that
they're
run
by
the
government?
here,
the
community
schools,
as
i
understand
it,
are
set
up
because
they
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
kind
of
failing
system
that
so
many
public
schools
are,
and
do
something
different.

00-1751,
zelman
versus
doris
simmons-harris.
in
1995,
a
federal
district
court
in
cleveland
ordered
the
cleveland
city
school
district
placed
under
the
control
of
the
state
of
ohio.
the
ohio
legislature
responded
by
enacting
a
number
of
emergency
measures,
including
the
ohio
pilot
project
scholarship
program.
the
program
was
designed
to
provide
educational
choices
to
poor
families
in
the
cleveland
city
school
district
who
otherwise
had
no
option
but
to
send
their
children
to
a
failing
public
school.
in
relevant
part
the
program
provides
a
$2250
scholarship
voucher
to
more
than
3000
low-income
families
with
school
age
children
who
reside
in
the
district.
parents
are
free
to
use
their
scholarship
voucher
at
any
private
school
in
the
district
that
agrees
to
accept
program
students.
public
schools
and
districts
adjacent
to
the
cleveland
city
district
are
also
eligible
to
accept
program
students
though
none
has
agreed
to
do
so.
there
are
currently
56
private
schools
participating
in
the
program,
42
of
which
82%
are
private-religious
school.
as
of
the
1999
school
year,
96%
of
the
students
who
received
tuition
vouchers
under
the
program
chose
to
expand
their
vouchers
at
religious
school.
respondents
are
a
group
of
ohio
taxpayers.
they
sued
in
federal
district
court
seeking
to
enjoin
the
program
on
the
ground
that
it
violated
the
establishment
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
respondents;
in
the
divided
panel
of
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
program
was
enacted
for
the
valid
nonreligious
purpose
of
providing
educational
assistance
to
poor
children
in
a
demonstrably
failing
public
school
system.
the
establishment
clause
question
is
does
whether
or
not
the
program
has
a
forbidden
effect
of
the
events
advancing
or
inhibiting
religion?
we
find
no
such
effect.
our
establishment
clause
decisions
consistently
distinguish
government
programs
that
provide
a
directly
to
religious
schools
from
programs
like
the
program
challenged
here
of
true
private
choice
in
which
government
aid
reaches
religious
schools
only
by
way
of
numerous
independent
decisions
of
numerous
private
individuals.
three
times
we
have
confronted
establishment
clause
challenges
to
programs
of
private
choice
and
three
times
we
rejected
these
challenges.
in
mueller
against
allen
in
1986,
we
found
no
constitutional
bar
to
a
minnesota
program
that
authorize
tax
deductions
to
families
of
private
school
student,
96%
of
whom
where
enrolled
in
religious
schools.
in
witters
against
washington
department
of
services
for
the
blind,
we
rejected
a
challenge
to
a
vocational
scholarship
program
that
provided
tuition
aid
to
students
studying
at
a
religious
institution
to
become
a
pastor,
and
in
zobrest
versus
catalina
foothills
school
district,
we
found
no
constitutional
bar
to
a
program
for
disabled
students
that
provided
sign
language
interpreters
to
students
enrolled
in
religious
schools.
in
each
of
these
cases,
we
stressed
the
principle
of
private
choice
saying
that
neutral
government
programs
that
provide
benefits
directly
to
a
broad
class
of
private
individuals
who
then
themselves
choose
to
direct
benefits
to
religious
schools
are
not
readily
subject
to
an
establishment
clause
challenge.
we
believe
that
the
program
challenged
here
is
a
program
of
two
private
choice
consistent
with
a
mueller
line
of
cases
and
thus
constitutional.
the
program
is
entirely
neutral
with
respect
to
religion.
all
schools
in
the
cleveland
city
school
district
may
participate.
this
made
some
schools
outside
of
it.
benefits
are
made
available
to
participating
families
according
solely
to
financial
need.
the
program
further
provides
substantial
opportunities
for
cleveland
parents
to
choose
non-religious
schools
for
their
school-age
children.
respondents
point
out
that
82%
of
the
participating
schools
are
religious
school,
but
that
figure
is
not
significant
considering
that
most
american
cities
contain
like
proportions
of
religious
private
schools.
nor
is
it
constitutionally
significant
that
96%
of
participating
students
currently
attend
religious
school.
we
reject
it
in
identical
claim
in
mueller
where
again
96%
of
the
beneficiaries
under
the
challenge
program
where
parents
of
children
enrolled
in
religious
schools.
we
said,
we
would
be
loath
to
adopt
a
rule
grounding
the
constitutionality
of
facially
neutral
law
on
annual
reports
residing
the
extent
to
which
various
classes
of
private
citizens
claim
benefits
under
the
law.
this
case
confirms
the
wisdom
of
mueller.
the
96%
figure
upon
which
respondents
rely
is
highly
misleading
when
one
considers
other
choices
that
ohio
has
made
available
to
cleveland
parents
including
community
schools
and
magnet
schools.
considering
these
options
and
the
denominator
of
cleveland
children
choosing
non-traditional
schools,
drops
the
percentage
enrolled
in
religious
schools
from
96%
to
well
under
20%
and
there
is
no
reason
not
to
consider
these
options.
the
only
reason
96%
of
program
students
presently
attend
religious
school
is
that
before
the
1999
school
year,
two
of
the
largest
non-religious
schools
to
participate
in
the
program
chose
instead
the
register
as
community
schools
due
largely
to
the
programs
uncertain
future
caused
by
this
litigation.
before
the
conversion
of
these
schools
from
program
schools
to
community
schools
only
78%
of
program
students
were
enrolled
in
religious
schools.
similar
fluctuations
in
religious
school
enrolment
have
been
witnessed
in
other
american
cities
with
school
choice
program.
given
the
evident
lack
of
any
principle
standard
to
evaluate
statistical
evidence
in
a
case
like
this,
we
therefore
hold
as
we
held
in
mueller
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
neutral
aid
programs
simply
does
not
turn
on
whether
and
why
in
the
particular
area
at
a
particular
time,
most
private
schools
are
run
by
religious
organizations
or
most
recipients
choose
to
use
government
aid
at
a
religious
school.
one
final
argument
lodged
against
the
program
is
equally
without
merit
we
think.
it
is
said
that
we
should
deny
cleveland
residents
the
potential
benefits
of
a
program
that
they
have
chosen
on
the
ground
that
their
program
is
potentially
divisive
and
may
cause
strife.
these
arguments
have
been
rejected
before
and
we
reject
them
again.
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
program
has
caused
any
divisiveness
or
strife
other
than
this
litigation
which
is
now
lasted
six
years,
and
where
such
a
speculative
argument
ever
to
be
accepted
by
a
majority
of
the
court
then
there
is
nothing
to
stop
another
majority
from
striking
down
other
potentially
divisive
government
programs
such
as
those
regulating
abortions
or
stem-cell
research
or
affirmative
action
on
the
same
ground,
such
a
noble
authorities
without
any
constitutional
basis.
justice
oâ€™connor
and
justice
thomas
have
filed
concurring
opinions.
