there's
such
a
dramatic
difference
between
a
choice
from
the
great
universe
of
colleges
and
universities,
what
a
particular
student
will
choose,
and
here,
the
difference
you
just
explained
to
justice
stevens
that
maybe
it
doesn't
matter.
justice
ruth

is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
the
quality
of
these
community
schools?
there
was
one
brief
that
said
they
were
too
new,
too
few,
too
unregulated,
too
untested
to
count.
justice

there
a
description
of
the
precise
community
schools
that
are
par-
participating
in
the
program,
and
the
quality
of
education
in
those
schools?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
you
agree
that
the
sixth
circuit
erred.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there's
really
no
record
on
the
community
schools,
you're
saying,
because
you
weren't
permitted
to
make
a
record?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
question,
because
i
think
we
understand
the
case
of
th-
the
government
employee
turning
over
his
paycheck
to
the
salvation
army,
or
whatever.
