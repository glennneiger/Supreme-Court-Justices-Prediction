mr.
robert
h.
chanin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
the
limitation
to
looking
at
the
voucher
program
as
a
freestanding
program
is
consistent
both
with
the
precedents
of
this
court
and
with
absolute
logic,
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
your
honor,
this
court
has
always
been
program
specific
in
its
financial
aid
cases.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
your
honor,
i
think
we're
doing
precisely
the
reverse.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
my
position.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
you
must
send
your
child
to
get
a
religious
education,
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
th-
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
this
court,
this
case
is
not
controlled
by
mueller,
for
the
very
same
reason
that
mueller
was
not
controlled
by
nyquist.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
think
there
are
two
parts
to
your
question,
if
if
i
may
take
them
in
sequence.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
th-
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
well,
the
answer
to
it
is
this,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
well,
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
s-
we
we
do
not
look
at
them
for
two
reasons,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
your
honor,
if
it
extends
that
way,
there
is
no
meaning
any
more
to
the
concept
of
genuinely
independent
and
private
choice.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
well,
because
you
have
a
basic
proposition
that
we
build
our
case
on,
which
the
court
has
a-
has
adopted,
and
it
is
this.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
not
in
my
mind,
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
it
i
i
focus
on
it
because
it
makes
it
clear
to
the
court,
i
hope,
that
this
isn't
even
a
close
to
the
line
case.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
of
the
criteria
that
this
court
used
in
witters.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
told
us
why
it
was...
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
it
said,
it
is
constitutional
because
the
aid
recipients
have
genuinely
independent
and
private
choice,
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
say
what
that
meant.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
of
which
were
secular.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
well,
that's
clearly
unconstitutional...
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
oh,
no.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
put
to
me
was,
there's
a
choice
and...
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i'm
sorry
if
i
if
you
thought
i
did
not.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
think
that
is
a
borderline
case,
but
if
it's
structured
this
way,
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
you
why
you...
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
relatively
simply.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
okay.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
right.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
but
do
i...
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
the
choice
you're
giving
me
as
an
aid
recipient.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
because
certainly
i
can
say,
without
hesitation,
nothing
broke
the
circuit
between
the
state
and
the
general
coffer
of
the
sectarian
school,
your
aid
recipient
in
your
hypothetical
had
no
choice
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
think
that's
witters.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
my
response
to
that
is,
th-
if
this
court
concluded
that
the
words,
significant
amount,
huge
array
of
choices,
if
the
court
concluded,
as
an
abstract
proposition,
that
those
standards
were
met
on
fifty
fifty,
i
would
be
most
unhappy,
but
i
would
conclude
that
the
program
was...
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
the
rationale
is
this.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
would
not
forget
the
cases.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
your
honor,
it's
it's
a
an
unreal
hypothetical.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no,
it
isn't
because
the
val-
the
everybody...
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
it
would
be
no
diffe-
it
would
be
un-
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
it's
no
different
than
saying,
you
can
take
a
voucher,
you
can
leave
public
education
and
go
to
a
religious
school,
or
you
don't
limit
it
to
community
schools,
or,
i'll
give
you
money
to
go
to
a
community
school,
i'll
give
you
money
to
go
to
a
magnet
school,
i'll
give
you
money
to
go
to
a
traditional
school.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
they
are
not
private
schools,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
there
are
certain
they
ha-
they
cannot
discriminate
on
certain...
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
i'm
not
sure
you...
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
because,
your
honor,
if
the
concept
of
breaking
the
circuit
is
going
to
have
any
meaning,
you
have
to
draw
a
line,
and
the
only
rational
line
to
draw
is
between
public
education...
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you,
your...
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
is
it
too
late?
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
there
is
no
tuition
if...
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
can
i
could
i
try
once
again
on
another
example
here?
the
prototype
that
this
court
has
set
out
for
us
of
genuine,
independent,
and
private
choice,
is
a
government
employee.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
for
government
in
the
first...
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
it
would
make
a
difference,
but
i
could
not
answer
as
to
whether
it
would
be
constitutional
or
unconstitutional
as
far
as
the
program
is
concerned,
until
i
saw
the
specifics
of
that
program.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
we-
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
do
not
believe,
your
honor,
that
a
crisis
in
the
cleveland
public
schools
is
a
license
to
ignore
the
mandate
of
the
establishment
clause,
nor
do
i
think
it's
a
mandate
to
say,
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
because
in
a
few...
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
state
of
ohio
should
do
in
this
specific
case
is
exactly
what
the
ohio
supreme
court's
been
telling
them
to
do
for
ten
years
to
deal
with
the
problems
in
cleveland.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
not
according
to
the
ohio
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no,
i
say
this,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
refer
you
to
the
amicus
brief
of
the
national
school
boards
association.
