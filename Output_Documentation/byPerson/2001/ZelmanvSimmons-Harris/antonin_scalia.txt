and
you
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
it
didn't
have
that...
justice
antonin
scalia
because
they
get
more...
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
information
in
the
record
about
the
quality
of
the
religiously
affiliated
schools?
justice
antonin
scalia
particular
schools
in
this
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
hm.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
wouldn't
limit
it
to
the
vouchers
anyway,
would
you?
i
mean,
you
would
you
would
think
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
money
that
goes
to
the
community
schools.
justice
antonin
scalia
go
via
bou-
vouchers,
but
goes
directly
to
the
schools,
and
it's
a
greater
amount
of
money
that
goes
to
the
private
schools,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
breyer
could
send
his
child
to
one
of
the
community
schools,
which
is
entirely
nonsectarian,
under
this
program,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
schools
would
get
more
money
than
the
than
the
th-
than
the
sectarian
schools
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
i
didn't
i
didn't
quite
understand
justice
stevens'
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
program
was
available
to
all
the...
justice
antonin
scalia
could
have
gone
into
into
a
one
of
the
community
schools,
or
to
one
of
the
private
schools,
justice
antonin
scalia
you
you
you
say
it
would
be
perfectly
okay
if
it
went
to
a
private
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
not
even
go
to
nonsectarian...
justice
antonin
scalia
this
money
could
not,
in
your
view,
even
go
to
nonsectarian
private...
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could,
and
that
would
be
a
rational
way
for
the
state
to
provide
for
the
education
of
children...
justice
antonin
scalia
schools
and
some
in
private
schools,
but
if
any
of
those
private
schools
is
a
religiously
affiliated
school,
that
is
a
no-no.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that,
in
your
view,
is
neutrality?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
not
say
here,
as
you
put
it,
that
you
must
go
to
these
religiously
affiliated
schools.
justice
antonin
scalia
suddenly
it
changes,
and
it's
not
education
any
more
if
you're
getting
it
in
a
religious
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
endorsement
of
religion
involved
here,
i
don't
see
why
the
fact
that
some
of
the
money,
even
most
of
the
money
goes
to
religious
schools
makes
any
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
schools
have
to
accept
all-
allcomers?
justice
antonin
scalia
take
kids
who
pass
a
certain
a
certain
test,
a
certain
entrance
exam?
justice
antonin
scalia
public
school
system...
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
sound
much
like
the
public
school
system
to...
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
tell
me
ho-
how
we
get
from
here
to
there?
here
we
have
a
failed
inner
city
school
system,
and
the
state
says,
part
of
the
m-
part
of
the
problem
with
this
is
is
monopoly.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
schools
that
happen
to
be
there
right
now
are
religious
schools.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
start
off
with,
of
course
they're
mostly
religious,
an-
and
that
that
is
going
to
destroy
the
entire
program,
so
that
we
can
never
get
from
here
to
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
seven
thousand
dollars
per
child,
which
is
above
the
average
in
the
rest
of
the
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
judge
frankel,
you're
you're
going
to
tie
this
into
the
question
presented
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
y-
your
assumption,
judge
frankel,
is
that
the
problem
is
a
problem
of
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
a
problem
of
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
familiar
with
suggest
that
that
is
not
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
finish,
sir.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
studies
that
i'm
familiar
with
say
that
that
the
inner
city
parochial
schools,
which
spend
much
less
per
child
on
education,
do
a
much
better
job
than
the
public
schools
that
spend
much
more,
so
i
i
just
don't
think
it
follows
f-
that
that
that
once
you
solve
a
constitutional
problem
that
will
get
more
money,
you're
you're
you're
going
to
solve
the
the
difficulty
that
the
people
of
cleveland
found
with
their
public
schools.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
i
don't
think
it's
anecdotal
at
all.
