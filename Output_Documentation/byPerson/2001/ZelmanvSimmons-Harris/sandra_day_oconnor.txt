why
we
don't
take
account
of
the
availability
of
the
community
schools
in
analyzing
this
program?
we
would
like
the
court
to
take
very
much
account
of
the...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
fact,
to
the
parents?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
tuition
assistance
would
be
provided
if
the
selection
were
for
a
community
school?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if-
if
a
community
school
is
selected,
no
additional
money
then
is
provided,
as
would
be
provided
i-
if
the
religious
school
were
selected?
that's
true,
your
honor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
some
of
the
private
nonsectarian
schools
in
the
city
become
community
schools?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
slots
available
in
the
community
schools
for
these
children
that
we're
talking
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
same
amount
of
money
per
capita
go
to
a
community
school
as
would
go
to
the
regular
public
school...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
you
if
this
court
would
have
to
overrule
the
nyquist
case
to
support
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
points
the
other
way,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
concern
about
the
establishment
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
closest
of
our
cases,
do
you
think,
to
the
ohio
program?
is
it
witters?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
difference
would
be
however
that
according
to
respondents
the
choices
are
much
more
limited
here...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
witters.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
have
to
link
the
two
programs
together
to
resolve
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
trogram
[:
program]
and
the
money
paid
to
the
parents
and
endorsed
over
to
the
schools
in
the
case
of
choice?
do
we
have
to
consider
both
together?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
ask
how
the
courts
faced
with
this
challenge
have
to
view
the
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
below
not...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
only
to
low
income
children,
or
does
it
just
i-
does
that
affect
the
amount
of
money
to
be
given?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
only
a
finite
amount
of
money
available.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
no
attempt
made
in
the
program
to
make
sure
that
the
money
that
ends
up
in
the
parochial
schools
is
not
used
for
religious
training,
or
teaching.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
there
have
been
other
federal
programs,
for
example,
where
there
have
been
such
limitations
on
usage.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wait
wait
wait
just
a
minute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
understand
either
point,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
proper.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
some
of
the
private
schools
had
become
community
schools,
and
is
it
not
true
that
parents
can
choose
to
have
their
children
educated
in
a
community
school
and,
if
they
do,
that
school
gets
more
money
from
the
state
than
if
they
had
chosen
the
religious
school?
if
anything,
it's
skewed
against
the
religious...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
public
support.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
do
you
not
put
the
community
schools
and
the
magnet
schools
in
the
universe
of
choices?
that's
the
problem
i'm
having
with
your
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
only
true
if
you
say
the
person
is
reasonable
in
not
looking
at
all
the
choices,
which
include
community
schools,
certainly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
me
ask
you
this.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
not,
because
in
effect
that's
what's
happened
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
community
school
gets
forty-five
hundred
dollars
a
head,
and
the
s-
parochial
school
twenty-five
hundred,
so
if
if
it
were
done
by
a
little
voucher
working
that
way,
then
what
is
your
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
perceived
as...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
school.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
been
referring
to
community
schools
as
public
schools.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
schools
public
schools...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
have
separate
boards?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
separate...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
same
control
over
content
of
programs?
justice
sandra

financed?
