mr.
david
l.
young
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
david
l.
young
your
honor,
it
isn't
exactly
the
same
at
all.
mr.
david
l.
young
in
this...
mr.
david
l.
young
your
honor,
we
have
tutorial
vouchers
for
people
in
in
public
schools,
and
tutorial
vouchers
for
magnet
schools
and
community...
mr.
david
l.
young
well,
i
would
s-
your
honor,
i
would
suspect
the
answer
to
that
is
to
try
to
provide
some
form
of
equality
and
and
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
government
endorsement
of
one
choice
or
another,
so
the
e-
equality
of
having
the
same
number
of
grants
for
for
tutoring
being
the
same
as
the
same
number
going
for
scholarships.
mr.
david
l.
young
your
honor,
there
is
a
difference,
but
there
is
less
a
difference
than
the
difference
between
the
public
school
and
the
nonpublic
school
deductions
taken
in
mueller.
mr.
david
l.
young
your
honor,
i
think
the
fact
there
is
no
question
that
when
this
program
was
initially
implemented,
every
single
secular
school
in
the
district
signed
up
to
participate.
mr.
david
l.
young
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
young
your
honor...
mr.
david
l.
young
for
the
reasons
i've
already
noted,
your
honor,
i
believe
there
is
no
governmental
no
governmental
endorsement,
and
you
have
to
realize
that
i-
th-
th-
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
elible
[:
eligible]
eligible
children
elected
to
remain
in
the
public
school,
and
incidentally...
mr.
david
l.
young
y-
y-
your
honor,
that's
another
alternative,
and
i
think
we...
mr.
david
l.
young
your
honor,
i
see
that
as
another
reason
why
no
one
could
say
there's
a
reasonable
message
of
governmental
endorsement
in
this
case.
mr.
david
l.
young
your
honor,
the
same
approach
was
taken
by
judge
oliver,
but
i
d-
don't
feel
that
the
sixth
circuit
really
understood
how
the
community
school
program
worked,
or
how
one
could
use
the
tutorial
vouchers
to
help
the
children
that
elected
to
go
to
the
community
schools.
mr.
david
l.
young
your
honor,
there
is
an
extensive
record
fr-
of
in
affidavits
in
terms
of
the
creation
of
the
of
the
of
the
community
schools,
the
transfer
of
the
two
secular
scholarship
schools
to
community
school
status.
mr.
david
l.
young
your
honor,
i
would
consider
them
together,
but
it
was
it's
the
all
of
the
indicia
of
choice,
not
just
the
endorsement.
