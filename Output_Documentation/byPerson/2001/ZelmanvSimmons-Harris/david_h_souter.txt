w-

so,
you
take

matter?
i
mean,
if-
if
they're
proselytizing,
doesn't
it
make
good
sense
for
them
to
admit
anybody
who
may
come
along,
and
yet
the
proselytizing
can't
be
subsidized
under
the
establishment
clause?
justice
david

well,
but
doesn't
that
simply
then
go
back
to
this
neutrality
point,
and
you're
saying
because
it's
neutral,
in
the
sense
that
it's
offered
in
an
even-handed
way,
query
i'm
me-
your
your
friends
on
the

tide
dispute
that,
but
just
accepting
that
categorization,
because
it's
neutral
in
that
sense,
that's
a
distinction
which
ought
to
make
a
difference
in
the
result.

term
as
result
of
what
the
government
is
doing,
which
is
a
separate
issue
as
to
whether
what
the
significance
is
of
the
private
choice,
but
the
the
effect
that
nyquist
was
concerned
with,
and
the
effect
that
i
think
has
been
shown
here,
is
a
substantial
amount
of
money,
a
to
the
schools
themselves,
and
in
relation
to
the
amount
of
money
spent
on
the
program,
justice
david
h.

respects
the
the
two
are
identical.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
the
amount
of
money
is
vastly
different,
isn't
it,
because
the
i
forget
the
figures
exactly,
but
isn't
the
the
limit
on
the
tutorial
something
like
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
student,
as
opposed
to
the
two
thousand
some
odd
limit
on
the
on
the
tuition
vouchers?
justice
david

souter
but
why
why
don't
we
why
don't
you
st-
well,
i
know
why
you
don't
stress,
but
why
shouldn't
we
stress
as
one
of
those
facts
the
bottom
line
of
ninety-six
percent
of
the
kids
taking
the
the
tuition
aid,
are
taking
it
in
in
parochial
schools?
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
that
suggest
that
there
is
perhaps
something
specious
about
this
notion
that
it's
a
matter
of
wide
open
choice
here?
in
practical
terms,
the
money's
going
to
end
up
where
it
ends
up,
and
the
ninety-six
percent
figure
is
pretty...
justice
david
h.
souter
asking
you
a
question
about
practical
significance,
and
and
why
do
we
eliminate
that
fact
from
our
judgment
about
what
in
the
real
world
seems
to
be
going...
justice
david
h.
souter
there
are
three
dissenting
opinions
in
this
case,
one
by
justice
stevens,
one
by
justice
breyer
joined
by
justice
stevens
and
by
me
in
one
of
my
own
joined
by
justice
stevens,
justice
ginsburg,
and
justice
breyer.
the
opinions
vary
in
emphasis
but
all
of
us
who
dissent
recognize
several
basic
points.
first,
the
decision
of
the
majority
completes
the
rejection
of
some
fundamental
doctrine
implementing
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
which
forbids
government
aid
benefiting
the
religious
teaching
of
religious
schools.
second,
the
reasoning
of
the
majority
in
support
of
its
decision
completes
the
replacement
of
a
substantive
constitutional
standard
with
formalistic
standards
which
we
dissenters
do
not
believe
the
majority
even
applies
according
to
the
terms
of
the
formalistic
standards
themselves.
third,
the
majority’s
conclusion
thgat
ohio’s
voucher
aid
is
constitutional
when
directed
to
religious
schools
violates
every
objective
that
the
establishment
clause
is
supposed
to
serve.
the
fundamental
doctrine
that
has
been
effectively
replaced
in
today’s
decision
was
stated
by
justice
black
in
the
everson
case
in
1947.
the
court
in
everson
began
with
the
words
of
the
establishment
clause
applicable
for
the
states
as
well
as
to
the
national
government
forbidding
any
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion.
as
applied
to
a
lower
providing
aid
that
could
benefit
a
religious
school,
the
court
said
that
the
prohibition
of
religious
establishment
meant
that
“no
tax
in
any
amount
large
or
small
can
be
levied
to
support
any
religious
activities
or
institutions,
whatever
there
may
be
called
or
whatever
form
they
may
adapt
to
teach
or
practice
religion.”
over
the
course
of
the
last
20
years,
the
court
has
moved
away
from
that
substantive
standard.
in
the
majority
opinion
today
ignores
the
gross
amounts
and
systemic
nature
of
the
aid
to
religious
schools
that
ohio’s
vouchers
will
provide.
the
majority
says
it
is
alright
so
long
as
the
voucher
law
is
neutral
in
form
and
the
money
gets
to
religious
schools
through
the
medium
of
private
choice.
for
reasons
that
i
said
out
in
my
opinion,
we
think
that
the
majority
is
saying
in
effect
that
any
voucher
scheme
that
funds
aid
to
religious
schools
is
fine
so
long
as
it
is
not
limited
to
religious
schools
and
so
long
as
there
are
also
public
schools
to
which
a
child
can
go.
this
leaves
the
neutrality
in
choice
test
virtually
meaningless
even
as
formal
criteria.
but
as
justice
stevens'
opinion
emphasize
is
what
matters
most
is
that
this
criteria
result
in
approving
aid
in
substantial
amounts
covering
full
tuition
of
children
in
religious
schools,
the
result
is
simply
that
public
tax
money
will
be
paying
on
a
substantial
and
systemic
basis
for
religious
instruction.
this
result
violates
every
objective
the
establishment
clause
has
ever
been
thought
to
serve.
first,
it
flatly
violates
what
our
ancestors
called
liberty
of
conscience
in
employing
the
power
of
the
state
to
force
tax-paying
citizens
to
support
religion;
second,
it
eliminates
the
protection
of
religion
itself
from
political
influence
which
inevitably
develops
when
religion
becomes
dependent
on
public
money.
this
influence
has
already
began
to
show
itself
in
ohio.
religious
schools
receiving
voucher
money,
for
example,
can
no
longer
give
preference
to
children
of
their
own
religion
when
admitting
pupils.
we
think
the
interference
with
religious
education
will
only
grow
worse
over
time.
it
will
grow
worse
if
voucher
money
becomes
generally
available
and
the
dependents
of
the
religious
education
on
tax
money
grow,
and
the
interference
will
get
worse
in
response
to
the
social
and
political
divisiveness
that
develops
when
government
supports
religion.
preventing
this
kind
of
animosity
is
a
third
objective
identified
with
the
ban
on
religious
establishment.
justice
breyer’s
opinion
addresses
the
prospect
of
divisive
animosity
in
some
detail
and
he
points
out
that
in
a
nation
with
the
religious
pluralism
of
the
united
states
it
is
simply
unrealistic
to
think
that
some
religious
groups
will
passively
act
while
others
enjoy
massive
infusions
of
tax
money.
justice
stevens,
justice
ginsburg,
justice
breyer,
and
i
believe
that
today’s
decision
is
a
major
devaluation
of
the
establishment
clause.
we
are
convince
that
the
decision
is
not
only
fundamentally
mistaken
but
potentially
tragic
and
we
respectfully
dissent
from
it.
