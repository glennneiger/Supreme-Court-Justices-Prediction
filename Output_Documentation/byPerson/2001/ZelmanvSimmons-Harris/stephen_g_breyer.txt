g.
breyer
what
is
actually
bother-
i-
i'd
like
to
hear
what
you
say
about
the
endorsement
point
that
justice
souter
initially
raised,
and
my
thought
is,
i'll
assume
no
discrimination,
and
i'll
assume
it's
a
fine
program,
but
imagine
you
came
from
europe
or
africa,
or
a
different
place,
and
said,
what
do
they
do
in
the
united
states
by
way
of
educating
their
children,
and
you're
told,
well,
sixty
billion
dollars
a
year,
forty
billion,
or
some
very
large
amount
of
money
is
being
spent
by
the
government
to
give
children
k
through
twelve
what
is
basically
a
religiously
oriented
education
taught
by
a
parochial
school.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
an
irony,
i
g-
are
you
is
that...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
if
if
i
mean,
the
irony
is
that
the
better
the
parochial
school,
in
a
sense,
the
less
the
freedom
of
choice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mean,
i
i
no
one's
complaining
about
the
quality
of
of
of
the
program.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
record
on
this
very
clear,
that
my
impression
was
really
the
parochial
schools
are
an
awful
lot
better.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
send
the...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
suppose
it
weren't
that
number.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
th-
all
this
ninety-nine
percent
doesn't
make
that
much
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
response
if
it's
fifty
fifty
and
you
have
hundreds
of
millions
of...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
saying
remember
is...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
w-
what
breaks
the
circuit
in
my
fifty
fifty
case?
does
you
say
it
doesn't
break
the
circuit,
but
they're
saying,
well
the
petitioners
say,
we
gave
the
money
to
the
individuals.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
the
cases,
but
give
me
the
the
rationale.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't
it?
