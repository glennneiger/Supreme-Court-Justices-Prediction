you
a
question
about
private
choice
which
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
case?
supposing
you
had
a
situation
with
a
small
community
that
had
one
public
school
and
one
religious
school,
and
they
would
pay
for
the
voucher
to
go
to
the
religious
school
if
the
family,
on
its
own
private
choice,
wanted
to
go

irrelevant,
really
that
there're
four
or
five
choices
available,
as
long
as
there's
a
free
choice
either
to
go
to
the

or
to
go

well,
we
have
a

suggestion

didn't

justice
john

the

went
to

that's
exactly
what's
happening
here.

just

john

that

tutorial
vouchers,
why
is
the
number
of
tutorial
vouchers
limited
to
the

number
of

for
paid
to

justice
john

no
but
i
think
you
would
say
the
program
was
still
constitutional,
even
if
it
was
just
conceived
in
the
healthiest
school
system
in
the
world.
justice
john

that
argument
is,
why
did
they
make
th-
this
wonderful
solution
available
to
such
a
small
percentage
of
the
student
body?
justice
john
paul
stevens
very
question,
do
you
think
these
alternatives
are
essential
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view,
or
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
there
were
merely
the
one
choice,
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
either
go
to
the
public
school,
or
you
can
go
to
the
parochial
school,
and
if
you
go
to
the
parochial
school,
we'll
pay
the
tuition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
here,
but
what
would
you
do
with
that...
justice
john
paul

purely
private.
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
that's
perfectly
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
or
not
those
alternatives
are
constitutionally
necessary,
or
just
make
your
argument...
justice
john
paul

just
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it's
ten
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
s-
if
iu
nderstand
the
case
correctly,
your
view
is,
if
any
one
school
gets
the
money,
it's...
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
thought
you
said...
justice

schools,
nine
s-
nine
nonsectarian,
one
sectarian?
justice
john

well
say...
justice
john

ninety-nine
nonsectarian
and
one
sectarian.
justice
john

that
in
this,
and
the
government
says,
y-
you
pick
your
school.
justice
john

we'll
send
a
check
direct
to
the

justice
john

that's
unconstituti-

constitutional
if
the
hundred
percent,

is
to

because
why?
justice
john

this
question?
is
it
true
that
the

you
put

of

there's
no
tuition
in
those?
