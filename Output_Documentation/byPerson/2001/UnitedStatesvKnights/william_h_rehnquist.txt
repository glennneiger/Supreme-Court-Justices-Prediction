talking
to

about

where
the

he
says,
in
this

case,
this

is
subject

on
reasonable
suspicion.
chief

william

good
argument
against
searching
someone
who's
not
on
probation,
but
it
doesn't
deal
with
your

to
say
they
could
have
gotten
a

it
wasn't...

that

00-1260,
united
states
against
knights.
a
california
court
sentenced
respondent
mark
james
knights
to
summary
probation
for
a
drug
offense.
the
probation
order
included
the
following
condition
that
knights
would
submit
its
person,
property,
place
of
residence,
vehicle,
personal
effects,
to
search
at
anytime
with
or
without
a
search
warrant,
warrant
of
arrest
or
reasonable
cause
by
any
probation
officer
or
law
enforcement
officer.
knights
signed
the
probation
officer
which
stated
that
he
received
a
copy,
understood
it,
and
agreed
to
abide
by
it.
just
a
few
days
after,
he
was
placed
on
probation,
a
pg&e
power
transformer
in
california
was
set
on
fire
causing
an
estimated
million
and
half
dollars
in
damage.
he
and
his
friends,
a
man
named
steven
simon
have
long
been
suspects
in
numerous
acts
of
vandalism
committed
against
pg&e
property.
several
more
events
occurring
after
the
arson
increased
the
suspicion.
finally,
detective
hancock
decided
to
search
knights'
apartment.
he
was
aware
of
knightsâ€™
probation
condition
so
he
did
not
think
a
warrant
was
necessary.
the
search
has
revealed
a
detonation
card,
ammunition,
liquid
chemicals,
instruction
manuals
on
chemistry
and
electrical
circuitry,
bold
cutters,
telephone
pole-climbing
spurs,
drug
paraphernalia
and
a
brass
padlocks
stamped
pg&e.
he
was
arrested
and
the
federal
grand
jury
indicted
him
for
conspiracy
to
commit
arson,
possession
of
unregistered
destructive
device
and
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
ammunition.
he
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
obtained
during
the
search
of
his
apartment.
the
district
court
held
that
detective
hancock
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
knights
was
involved
in
the
arson
but
it
granted
the
motion
to
suppress
because
of
some
cases
from
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
siad
a
stop
like
this
have
to
be
in
probationary
rather
than
investigatory
in
order
to
be
done
without
a
warrant
and
without
probable
cause.
the
court
of
appeals
affirms,
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed.
the
lower
courts
agreed
that
reasonable
suspicion
under
our
cases
existed
for
this
search.
that
is
a
degree
of
suspicion
less
than
probable
cause
but
for
what
we
call
a
terry
stop,
but
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
since
it
was
for
law
enforcement
purposes
not
rehabilitation
purposes,
it
was
invalid
under
the
fourth
amendment,
but
while
one
of
the
interests
of
the
government
in
granting
probation
is
to
rehabilitate
the
probationer.
another
equally
important
interest
is
to
protect
the
community
from
criminal
enterprise.
we
have
observed
and
statistics
support
the
observation
that
probationers
are
more
likely
to
engage
in
criminal
conduct
and
ordinary
citizens.
this
interest
of
the
government
together
with
knights
decreased
expectation
of
privacy
by
reason
of
his
probation
condition
justified
the
search
here.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
