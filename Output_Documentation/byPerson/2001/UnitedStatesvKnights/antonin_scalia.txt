well,
i
assume
that
don't
doesn't
that
reasonably
mean
a
law
enforcement
officer
who
has
authority?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
not
i
mean,
if
you
have
consent,
i
assume
it
could
be,
you
know,
a
law
enforcement
officer
from
afghanistan.
[inaudible]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
the
consent
is
reasonably
understood
to
be
limited
to
a
law
enforcement
officer
who
has
authority
under
the
applicable
law
of
the
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
not
an
afghan
officer.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
you
say
that,
i
don't
see
what
is
to
be
gained
by
drawing
the
the
big
distinction
that
you
attempt
to
draw
between
consent
and
nonconsent.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
somehow
the
the
the
i-
it
it
can't
be
a
punishment.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
no
consent,
if
it's
if
it's
connected
up
in
that
way,
why
isn't
it
valid?
justice
antonin
scalia
consent
to
torture?
can
you
consent
to
the
elimination
of
your
miranda
rights?
wouldn't
it
wouldn't
it
suffice
for
your
case
to
say
that
the
state
can
take
away
any
of
the
constitutional
rights
related
to
the
the
probationary
nature
of
the
of
of
of
the
punishment?
any
of
those
rights
u-
that
a
person
can
waive?
justice
antonin
scalia
waive
your
rights
to
torture
so
they'll
torture...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
even
thinks
that
he
agrees
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
sure
the
government
has
even
argued
what
justice
breyer
is
suggesting,
namely
that
i
assu-
it
follows
from
what
he's
suggesting
that
you
could
have
you
could
sentence
somebody
to
nothing
but
the
incapacitation
of
forfeiting
their
fourth
amendment
rights.
justice
antonin
scalia
griffin
relied
on
that
but
did
but
did
not
say
that
there's
that
that's
the
only
condition.
justice
antonin
scalia
supreme
court
had
had
adopted
a
a
different
principle,
and
we
said
we
we
begin
the
opinion,
we
think
the
w-
wisconsin
supreme
court
correctly
concluded
this
warrantless
search
could
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
griffin...
justice
antonin
scalia
not
interested
in
in
in
contemplating
the
creation
of
any
new
constitutional
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
it's
magic
that
that
a
probation
officer
has
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
state
that
doesn't
have
probation
officers?
you
mean
states
have
to
have
probation
officers?
suppose
suppose
they
just
say
we
don't
feel
any
need
for
special
probation
officers.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
i
mean,
that
then
that's
the
problem.
