isn't
the
isn't
the
agreement,
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
it
in
realistic
terms,
simply
notice?
this
is
not
something
that
the
prisoner
can
negotiate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
person
for
whom
there
is
no
jail
term?
and
i
think
you
conceded
there
is
a
category
where
probation
is
the
only
punishment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
you're
a-
you're
asking
for
a
rule
across
the
board.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
he's
in
prison,
can
the
police
then
go
to
his
premises?
suppose
he
he
had
been
put
in
jail
and
not
let
out
because
they
suspected
that
he
had
done
something
much
more
serious.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
jail,
that's
the
way
he
would
have
of
protecting
his
house
against
entry
without
a
warrant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
back
does
the
consent
or
the
notice
apply?
suppose
the
the
law
enforcement
officer
is
investigating
a
crime
that
occurred
before
the
defendant
was
apprehended
on
the
the
charge
for
which
his
sentence
is
probation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
you
couldn't
have
the
purpose,
well,
we
want
to
see
that
from
the
day
he's
put
on
probation,
he's
not
living
a
life
of
crime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting
then
we
draw
a
line
betwee-
depending
upon
how
serious
the
offense
is?
if
you
don't
commit
a
serious
offense,
but
if
you
howe-
however,
at
some
probation
you
could
attach
this
condition
and
other
probation
you
couldn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
addition
to
california,
that
had
as
a
condition
of
probation
that
y-
you
your
premises
can
be
searched
to
determine
whether
you
are
continuing
it
whether
you
are
engaged
in
crime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in-
individual
suspicion
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
griffin
means
wisconsin
can
do
what
wisconsin
was
doing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
case
that
the
defendant
loses
where
there's
a
fourth
amendment
claim
that
he
loses
and
say,
aha,
but
in
the
next
case,
he'll
win
because
the
court
confined
itself
to
the
situation
before
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
your
brief
about
the
unconstitutional
conditions
doctrine
rarely
applies
in
fourth
amendment
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
do
you
think
that's
so?
