mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
may
nineteen
ninety-eight,
respondent
was
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
drug
offense
in
a
california
court
and
was
placed
on
three
years'
probation.
one
term
of
his
probation
required
respondent
to
submit
to
searches
of
his
person
or
property,
quote,
with
or
without
a
search
warrant,
warrant
of
arrest
or
reasonable
cause
by
any
probation
officer
or
law
enforcement
officer.
the
acknowledgement
signed
by
respondent
stated
i
have
received
a
copy,
read,
and
understand
the
above
terms
and
conditions
of
probation
and
agree
to
abide
by
same.
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
long
held
that
such
an
acknowledgement
is
a
voluntary
and
enforceable
consent
to
future
searches
because,
under
california
law,
a
defendant
may
not
be
compelled
to
accept
probation,
but
may
insist
instead
on
serving
the
term
of
confinement
that
is
authorized
by
law.
less
than
a
week
after
respondent
was
placed
on
probation,
state
police
came
to
suspect
that
he
was
involved
in
an
act
of
vandalism
against
electric
and
telecommunications
facilities
that
caused
approximately
one
and
a
half
million
dollars
in
damage.
relying
on
the
search
condition,
police
searched
respondent's
residence
and
found
evidence
implicating
him
in
the
crime.
respondent
was
subsequently
indicted
in
federal
court
on
charges
of
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
and
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
ammunition.
[inaudible]
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
[inaudible]
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
would
have.
its
by
its
terms,
it
said
any
probation
officer
or
law
enforcement
officer.
i-
i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases
in
the
california
system
in
which
the
search
condition
has
actually
been
invoked
by
a
federal
officer,
but
i
think
it
would
apply
by
its
terms
to
such
searches.
[inaudible]
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
i
think
that's
correct.
it's
it's
unlikely
that
such
a
search
would
occur
because
presumably
one
of
the
terms
of
probation
would
be
that
the
the
respondent
would
be
required
to
remain
within
the
state
of
california,
and
it's
un-
unlikely
that
he
would
be
searched
in
california
by
nevada
officers.
but
i
think
if
if
such
an
un-
unlikely
scenario
unfolded...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
it
it
could
have
happened.
[inaudible]
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
i
think
it
would.
the
consent
would
apply
by
its
terms
because
it
refers,
without
qualification,
to
any
law
enforcement
officer.
[inaudible]
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
there
there
might
be
some
independent
basis
for
objecting
to
the
presence
of
the
officer
from
outside
the
state,
but
i
i
don't
think
that
the
consent
would
fail
to
extend
to...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
th-
the
supreme...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
court...
d-
don't...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
th-
i
think
the
calif-
i
think
that
may...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
it
might
it
might
include
a
nevada
officer,
and
if
if
under
the
circumstances
justice
stevens
posits,
there
were
actually
authority
for
a
nevada
officer
to
to
be
on
the
premises.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
th-
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
construed
the
consent
to
not
to
apply
to
searches
that
are
conducted
for
purposes
of
harassment
or
in
an
unreasonable...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
it
it
wouldn't
it
would
it
would
extend
beyond
monitoring
by
california,
because
one
of
the
terms
of
probation
is
that
the
individual
avoid
violations
of
any
criminal
law.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
certainly
california
has
the
primary
interest
in
ensuring
that
california
probationers
comply
with
the
terms
of
their
probation,
but
but
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
california
probation
for
respondent
or
another
probationer
to
violate
federal
law.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we-
we're
not
making
that
argument
all
the
way
because
there
would
be
some
possible...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
t-
to
to
to
take
an
example...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
i
think...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
an-
and
to
take
an...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
significance
is
that
this
is
that
the
defining
characteristic
of
probationers
is
that
they
have
recently
been
convicted
of
criminal
offenses,
and
the
premise
of
the
institution
of
probation,
as
the
court
said
in
griffin,
is
that
a
probationer
is
more
likely
than
the
average
citizen
to
violate
the
law.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
it
pre-
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
ev-
everything
stands
or
falls
on
the
fact
that
there
is
a
conviction.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well
we
would
say
that
even
if
there
had
been
no
agreement
that
is,
even
if
it
were
the
case
under
california
law,
as
it
is
under
federal
law,
that
an
individual
who
has
no
legal
right
to
that
an
individual
has
no
legal
right
to
refuse
probation,
even
if
probation
were
a
sentence
that
were
imposed
upon
the
defendant
without
his
consent
we
we
would
still
argue
that
the
search
condition
is
a
reasonable...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
let
me
give
an
example
of...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
is
almost
what
i'm
saying,
but
let
let
me...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
l-
let
me
give
an
example
of
why...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
right,
and
let
me
give
an
give
an
example
of
why
we're
not
going
quite
all
the
way
and
and
why
we
think
you're
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
th-
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
it's
correct
that
the
state
has
an
interest.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
state
fears,
when
a
probationer
is
released
into
the
c-
community,
is
that
he
may
commit
federal
crimes
as
in
addition
to
state
crimes,
it
may
reasonably
choose
to
subject
him,
in
effect,
to
increased
monitoring
by
federal
officials
by
saying
that
he
will
have
no
right
to
demand
the
judicial
warrant
even
as
to
searches
by
by
those
officials.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
w-
we
we
are
relying
on
both.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
the
agreement
provides
an
additional
check,
an
additional
means
of
assurance
that
the
conditions
of
probation
are
not
unduly
onerous.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
it
happens
rarely
but
it
does
happen.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i-
it's
you're
you're
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there
there
was
a
jail
term.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i-
i'm
sorry.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
his
choice
i
mean,
h-
he
th-
th-
the
likelihood
is
that
as
a
practical
matter,
he
will
have
more
privacy
when
on
probation
than
than
when
he
is
in
than
if
he
were
in
prison.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
i
mean
and,
you
know,
to
look
at
it
that
way,
you
could
say
that
probation
is
disadvantageous
because,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
it
may
extend
for
a
longer
period
of
time.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
would
still
take
the
position
that
such
a
term
was
reasonable,
but
it
would
be
a
pure
special
needs
case.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
th-
i
assume
that
you
would
cite
griffin,
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
in
our
position
that
is
inconsistent
with
griffin.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
u-
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
hm
m-
i
think
yeah,
i
think
we
would
say
that
for
the
for
the
consent
to
be
v-
valid,
the
individual's
waiver
of
rights
needs
to
bear
some
relit-
reasonable
relationship
to
the
fact
that
he's
on
probation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
i
think
that's
correct,
that...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
the
th-
the
court
has
said
that
ordinarily
even
when
the
government
has
discretion
to
grant
or
withhold
a
benefit
entirely,
it
may
not
grant
it
on
a
relinquishment
of
constitutional
rights
that
bears
no
reasonable
relationship
to
the
program
at
issue.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
right.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
th-
well
i
think
the
consent...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
we
we
have
we
have
said
i
mean,
i
i've
said
today
that
we
would
be
here
defending
the
condition
even
if
it
were
imposed
on
a
defendant
who
had
no
option
to
refuse
probation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
i
don't
i
don't
think
the
the
legitimacy
of
using
those
particular
methods
to
attempt
to
solve
as
yet
unanticipated
crimes
would
vary
depending
on
whether
the
individual
is
a
probationer
or
not.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
i
think
that's
probably
at
least,
i-
if
not
exactly,
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
you
can
you
can
waive
the
rights
that
are
explained
to
you
in
the
the
miranda
co-
colloquy.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
he
he
he
doesn't
under
california
law.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
there
there
may
be
r-
rare
situations
in
which
an
individual's
consent
b-
blanket
consent
to
searches
could
be
enforced
with...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
a-
i
i
mean,
certainly
the
the
type
of
cer-
there
there
would
have
to
be
some
justification
for
performing
the
search
based
on
the
fact
that
h-
he
was
a
probationer,
but
a-
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
i
think
for
f-
if
it
were
f-
for
a
third
offense,
i
th-
i
think
yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
th-
think
the
consent
would
apply,
by
its
terms,
to
that
situation,
and
it
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
i
agree
that
the
link
between
the
search
that
you
describe
and
u-
the
the
monitoring
of
compliance
with
the
conditions
of
probation
would
be
more
tenuous.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
state
of
california
has
represented
in
its
amicus
brief
that
the
state
has
a
little
over
sixty-seven
thousand
police
officers
and
a
little
over
seen
thousand
probation
officers
within
the
state.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
or
e-
or
even
if
you
don't
suspect.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
o-
w-
i-
e-
i
think
it's
it's
probably
more
likely
that
a
probation
officer
would
conduct
a
truly
suspicionless
search,
a
search
with
no
individualized
suspicion
whatever,
than
that
a
police
officer
would
do
so.
