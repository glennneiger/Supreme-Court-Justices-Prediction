mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
respondent's
argument
has
two
major
points.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
does.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
yes.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
exactly,
agrees
to
abide
by
same,
meaning
the...
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
it
does
say
agree,
your
honor,
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
well,
your
honor,
i'm
i'm
not
sure
that's
an
accurate
way
to
characterize
it,
in
that
with
this
probation
order,
we
don't
know
when
or
where
mr.
knights
signed
it.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
it
does
in
terms
of
was
this
an
order
of
the
court
it's
called
a
probation
order
that
was
imposed
on
him.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
th-
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
exactly.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
think
it
does
e-
if
you
of
course,
you
then
accept
the
second
point
which
is
was
this
blanket
search
authority
constitutional.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
well,
i
believe,
your
honor,
under
griffin
the
court
would
look...
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
you
could,
your
honor.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
no,
it
doesn't.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
in
in
this
case...
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
well,
your
honor,
the
the
hon-
your
honor's
argument
suggests
somewhat
the
greater
versus
the
lesser...
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
because,
your
honor,
the
rationale
for
the
limitation
of
prisoners'
fourth
amendment
rights
and
they
would
apply
also
to
individuals
at
halfway
houses
is
not
that
we
take
away
rights
as
a
punishment.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
yes,
it
is
a
purpose
of
punishment,
your
honor.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
your
honor,
my
answer
would
be
that
any
sentence
imposed
must
be
imposed
within
constitutional
limitations,
and
in
this
case,
i
think
griffin
is
an
essential
case
because
griffin
helps
us
see
what
are
the
constitutional
limitations
on
probationers'
fourth
amendment
rights.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
well,
no,
not
quite,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
should
or
or
would
dispense
with
the
reasonable
suspicion
requirement
in
this
situation.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
i
i
believe
that's...
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
okay
well
you
may
have
gotten
ahead
of
me.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
for
this
reason,
your
honor.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
your
honor,
three
reasons.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
your
honor,
now
i
remember
two
of
the
reasons.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
your
honor,
this
condition
i
no.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
no,
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
yes,
and
it's
only
because
he's
a
probationer
that
he
can
be
searched
without
a
warrant
at
all.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
no,
i
i
think
what
the
judge
would
would
do
in
addition
to
making...
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
well,
yes,
your
honor,
though
i
i
don't
mean
to
suggest,
in
fact,
that
a
condition
that
simply
required
reasonable
suspicion
and
and
did
not
ensure
that
it
was
going
to
be
probationary
searches,
would
be
constitutional
because
the
exception
that
we're
talking
with
here,
to
the
fourth
amendment,
is
a
special
needs
exception.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
it
doesn't.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
well,
your
honor,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
the
intermediate
sanction
programs,
which
have
been
implemented,
i
hope
effectively,
across
this
country
by
different
states
that
are
cited
by
amicus
mm
several
of
the
amici
not
a
single
program
relies
on
random
searches
by
police.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
your
honor,
apart
from
california,
i'm
aware
only
of
virginia
as
having
approved
a
blanket
search
condition
such
as
this
with
no
limitations
for
individualized
suspicion
and
no
limitation
to
the
probation
officer.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
states
permit
probation
officers,
as
part
of
their
duties,
to
conduct...
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
because
it's
disproportionate.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
yes.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
i
understand
that
in...
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
well,
your
honor,
looking
again
at
the
facts
of
our
particular
case,
that
officer,
detective
hancock,
had
over
twelve
hours
during
which
he
prepared
to
do
this
search.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
i
guess
what
i
was
thinking
is
it
shows
that
that
expanding
the
griffin
probation
search
condition,
special
needs
doctrine,
is
not
necessary
to
enable
detective
hancock
to
search
because
he
could've
searched
a
different
way.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
certainly
not,
your
honor,
and
i
and
i
have
not
sought
to
represent
that.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
i-
that's
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
your
honor,
i
think
it's
a
close
question.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
now,
that's
clearly
const-
i
think,
constitutional
if
they
were
conducted
by
the
probation
department.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
yeah,
it's
well,
again,
i
would
never
use
less
intrusive
than
jail
as
a
standard
of
assessing
the
constitutionality
of
a
probation
condition
because
certainly
a
condition
that
the
defendant
pay
money
to
the
opposing
party
or
the
di-
district
attorney
would
be
less
onerous
than
jail,
but
doesn't
answer
whether
it's
constitutional.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
all
right.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
it
it
might.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
your
honor...
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
well,
this
i
think
is
the
important
distinction
between
probasion
[:
probation]
and
police,
and
it's
a
two-part
answer.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
that's
my
understanding,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
hilary
a.
fox
i
think
the
special
needs
balancing
is
the
unconstitutional
d-
doctrines
unconstitutional
conditions
doctrine
in
the
fourth
amendment
situation.
