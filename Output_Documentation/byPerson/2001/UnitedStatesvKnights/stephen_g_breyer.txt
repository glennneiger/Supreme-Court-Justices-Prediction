justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
relevance
of
this
is
escapes
me
slightly
because
i
i
wonder
what
mean,
i
you
may
have
plenty
of
power
to
impose
the
condition
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what's
his
choice
in
respect
to
search?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
say
he
consents
to
search
without
his
consent
is
like
saying
i
consent
to
being
a
human
being.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
grant
you
he
concedes
he
can
choose
whether
to
be
in
prison
or
out
of
prison.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
choose
whether
to
be
searched
or
not
be...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
wouldn't
have
to
we
wouldn't
have
to
accept
that,
would
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can't
we
say
that's
totally
wrong
or
say
that
th-
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case?
what
about
y-
what
about
leaving
that
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
meaning.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
suppose
i
say
you're
right
about
consent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nothing
to
do
with
greater
versus
lesser.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i-
if
i
were
to
tell
you
in
my
experience,
which
is
somewhat
in
this
area
i've
had
experience
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
punishment
is
incapacitation,
and
you're
saying
that
we
couldn't
have
a
punishment
that
would
be
designed
to
do
that
by
searching
by
searching
people's
cells
randomly
to
be
sure
that
they're
not
committing
crimes
in
in
a
prison
in
order
to
make
sure
i
mean,
i-
i
though-
i
had
thought
i'm
not
positive,
but
i
had
thought
that
that
was
an
important
purpose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
actually
isn't
my...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
my
question
is
designed
to
show
you
to
suggest
that
there
is
a
purpose
in
searches
that
is
related
to
a
basic
aim
of
punishment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
point
is
to
suggest
to
you
to
ask
answer
me
as
to
why
that
same
purpose
doesn't
apply
when,
in
fact,
the
person
is
on
probation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
tha-
that's
exactly...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
if
that's
so,
how
do
you
distinguish
this
particular
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
bothering
me
from
a
policy
perspective
is
there
are
a
whole
range
of
punishments
called
intermediate
punishments,
which
perhaps
should
be
encouraged,
and
they
include
things
like
boot
camp
not
boot
camps,
but
halfway
houses,
home
confinement,
night
and
weekend
confinement,
and
probation.
