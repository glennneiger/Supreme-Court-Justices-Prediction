justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
isn't
doesn't
your
argument
have
a-
a-
an
even
narrower
consequence?
because
part
of
your
argument,
which
i
i
i
want
to
go
into,
rests
upon
the
fact
that
if
he
didn't
consent,
the
state
could
could
commit
him,
could
put
him
put
him
in
the
house
of
correction.
justice
david
h.
souter
my
what
about
my
question?
if
if
there
is
significance
in
the
fa-
in
your
argument,
and
i
take
it
there
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
monitoring
by
california.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
understand
that,
but
it's
california
that
monitors
california
probationers,
isn't
it?
it's
not
f-
it's
not
federal
probation
officers
and
it's
not
nevada
probation
officers.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
i
i
realize
that,
but
i'm
just
saying
e-
y-
i-
well,
let
me
let
me
put
the
question
to
you
f-
blithely.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
if
you
made
that
argument
all
the
way
there
would
be
no
significance
in
the
in
the
agreement,
would
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
were
your
argument,
there
would
you
we
would
need
an
agreement.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
significance
of
the
power
of
california
to
commit
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
boil
down
then
to
saying
that
the
significance
of
the
conviction
is
simply
that
it
presents
the
occasion
for
this
agreement
and
that
it's
the
agreement
that
is
really
what
is
significant
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
stands
or
falls
on
the
fact
that
there's
an
agreement.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
there
were
no
conviction,
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
the
agreement.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
case,
you
would
be
saying
that
because
california
had
power
to
deal
with
him
at
that
point,
it
had
power,
in
effect,
to
limit
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
no
i
mean,
there's
no
general
rule
across
the
board
that
i
know
of
that
because
someone
has
been
convicted,
the
state,
in
effect,
can
can
can
limit
bill
of
rights
entitlements
as
a
general
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
the
specific
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
prisoner
at
that
time
that
governs,
in
effect,
what
the
state
can
do
to
to
limit
rights.
justice
david
h.
souter
rule
would
apply
in
the
state
e-
as
as
probationary
supervisor
vis-a-vis
probationer.
justice
david
h.
souter
follow
from
that
then
that
the
state's
right
to
limit
is
itself
limited
by
the
state's
interest
in
supervising
probation,
as
distinct
from
the
state's
interest
as
a
general
enforcer
of
the
criminal
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
that
mean
then,
at
this
point
in
the
argument,
that
you're
relying
on
the
state's
power
as
as
the
as
the
state
vis-a-vis
a
convict
for
your
position
rather
than
the
convict's
agreement
for
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
it
i
mean,
if
if
your
last
argument
is
sound,
what
does
the
agreement
add?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
effect,
yes,
justice
breyer,
you
the
the
government
could
have
a
a
pr-
a
regime
of
probation
in
which
they
subject
you
to
random
searches,
but
what
the
government
cannot
do
is
have
a
regime
of
probation
in
which
you
are
subjected
to
nonrandom
searches,
searches
conducted
not
in
supervision
of
probationers,
but
searches
conducted
in
the
investigation
of
specific
crimes,
and
in
the
latter
case,
the
the
government
ought
to
follow
normal
fourth
amendment
standards?
is
that,
in
effect,
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
random
searches
with
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
wasn't
there
reasonable...
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
