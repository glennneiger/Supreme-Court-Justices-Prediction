justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
mister
may
i
ask
this
question?
th-
the
actual
search
was
conducted
by
state
officers,
as
i
understand
it.
[inaudible]
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
consent
would
have
applied
equally
to
federal
officers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
a
law
enforcement
officer
from
nevada?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
could
be
on
the
basis
of
a
preexisting
criminal
situation.
i
mean,
he
might
have
committed
a
crime
in
nevada
two
years
ago.
[inaudible]
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
do
you
think?
would
it
apply
to
a
nevada
officer
as
well,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
excuse
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
really
want
to
u-
understand
the
government's
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
rights
he
can
give
up
are
related
to
the
purpose
of
of
a
of
the
enforcement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
justice
john
paul
stevens
get
you
get
information
out
of
people
sometimes
by
applying
the
screw.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
certainly
waive
your
right
to
miranda,
then
you
could
waive
your
right
to
say
questioning
for
u-
th-
three
days
in
a
in
a
cell.
justice
john
paul
stevens
another
question?
to
what
extent
is
the
waiver
of
fourth
amendment
rights
total
in
your
view?
could
he,
for
example
oh
see
could
you
say
he's
waived
his
right
to
every
six
hour
of
body
cavity
searches,
justice
john
paul
stevens
something
very
extreme
and
intrusive
searching...
justice
john
paul
stevens
statute
is
constitutionally
compelled?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
waive
his
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
searches,
but
not
from
very
unreasonable
searches.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
that
i've
been
pondering
about
during
the
argument
and
don't
know
what
the
answer
is?
do
you
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
a
state
legislature
to
decide
that
we
don't
want
to
put
drug
offenders
in
prison
anymore,
but
we
do
want
to
impose
on
them,
ina-
in
haec
verba,
condition
nine
of
the
probation
order
here
and
that
it
pass
a
statute
and
say
all
drug
offenders
who
are
convicted
of
possession
of
illegal
drugs
shall
have
to
submit
to
that
provision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
less
intrusive
than
going
to
jail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
in
a
way
because
what
the
the
net
result
of
a
criminal
conviction
is
a
loss
of
liberty,
and
the
question
is
which
liberties
can
you
be
deprived
of
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
going
to
jail,
but
you
can't
lose
this
lesser
liberty.
