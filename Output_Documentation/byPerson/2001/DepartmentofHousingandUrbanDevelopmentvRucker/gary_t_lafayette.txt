mr.
gary
t.
lafayette
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
response
to
congress'
enactment
of
1437d(l)(6)
and
hud's
regulations,
the
oakland
housing
authority
revised
its
lease
to
properly
reflect
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
with
regard
to
the
hud
regulations.
and
it
specifically
did
that
in
three
instances.
it
revised
the
lease
at
paragraph
9(m)
and
it
revised
the
occupants'
responsibility
statement,
and
then
it
revised
what
is
known
as
the
tenant
agreement
to
maintain
a
drug-free
environment.
in
each
instance,
it...
it
advised
each
tenant
and
requested
each
tenant
to
sign
a
statement
acknowledging
that
they
clearly
understood
that
if
this
type
of
conduct
took
place
within
their
apartment
or
off
housing
authority
property,
that
they
could
be
subjected
to
a
lease
cancellation.
in
this
case,
we
came
forward
with
four
individuals
whose
leases
were
canceled
because
of
this
particular
type
of
activity.
and
the
housing
authority's
position
is
it
was
necessary
for
it
to
take
the
action
with
regard
to
each
one
of
these
particular
individuals
because
of
the
conduct
that
they
were
participating
in
or
the
conduct
of
individuals
in
their
households
were
participating
in,
which
conduct
which
posed
a
significant
risk
of
injury
to
other
members
of
the
housing
authority
and
to
the
community
in
which
these
particular
developments
are
located.
mr.
gary
t.
lafayette
it's
a...
it's
a
significant
problem.
one
of
the
things
that
we've
pointed
out
in
our
moving...
in...
in
our
merits
brief
was
that
this
is
a
housing
authority
that
has
approximately
8,000
individuals
who
are
scattered
in
3,308
low
income
to
moderate
income
housing
units.
from
1998
until
november
of
this
past
year,
there
were
700
felony
arrests
for
drug-related
criminal
activity
in
or
near
oakland
housing
authority
property.
significantly,
between
january
1,
2001
and
november
6,
2001,
the
number
of
felony
arrests
was
250
for
drug-related
activity.
that's
a
significant
sum.
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
is
also
significant
is
that
this
is
a
housing
authority
that
does
not
necessarily
have
large
housing
development
complexes.
a
number
of
its
developments
are
smaller
units.
for
example,
in
the
hill
and
lee
cases,
those
are
individuals
who
resided
in...
in
a
development
that
is
approximately
eight
units,
eight
units
in
a
neighborhood
that
is
comprised
almost
exclusively
of
single
family
dwellings.
when
these
individuals
participate
in
this
drug
activity
in
the
front
of
that
unit,
it
is
not
only
affecting
the
members
of
the
housing
authority
community
itself,
it
is
affecting
the
general
community
at
large
and
all
the
individuals
there.
and
significantly
we
need
to
point
out
that
we
responded
there
not
because
we
happened
to
be
driving
by,
but
the
response
was...
was
premised
on
a
complaint
being
made.
and
that's
part
of
the
record.
so,
what's
happening
is
this
housing
authority
is
responding
to
complaints
made
by
residents,
and
one
of
the
things
that
we
point
out
is
this
housing
authority
has
been
subjected
to
litigation
by...
being
made
by
its
residents
demanding
that
the
housing
authority
take
more
affirmative
action
and
steps
to
address
these
issues
of
drug
and
drug-related
activity.
in...
it
seems
to
me...
to
me
that
there
is
no
issue
that
in
each
one
of
these
particular
cases
there
was
just
cause
for
the
housing
authority
to
go
forward
and...
and
to
exercise
this
discretion
reasonably
and
that
it
did
so.
and
one
of
the
things
that...
that
seems
to
appear
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
exercising
discretion,
and
we
always
point
the
court
to
the
case
of
pearlie
rucker
because
that's
a
case
where
the
housing
authority
initially
proceeded
with
termination
of
that
lease
and,
in
the
process
of
doing
so,
came
to
understand
that
the
individual
in
the
household
who
was
participating
in
the
drug
activity,
gelinda
rucker,
was
a
person
who
had
actually
become
incarcerated
and
therefore
no
longer
posed
a
risk
of
injury
to
the
remainder
of
the
housing
authority
or
the
community.
realizing
that,
the
agency
at
that
point
discontinued
its
efforts
to
dismiss
that...
to
terminate
that
lease.
and
at
the
time
this
lawsuit
was
actually
filed,
there
was
no
longer
a
pending
dispute
between
the
housing
authority
and
pearlie
rucker
who
was
the...
who
was
the
tenant
responsible
for
that
lease.
mr.
gary
t.
lafayette
that
would
be
unreviewable.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
the
housing
authority
needs
the
discretion
to
act
where
it
believes
it
is
necessary
for
it
to
act.
and
in
each
one
of
these
instances,
this
housing
authority
has
come
forward
with
that
position.
and
without
that
discretion,
a
housing
authority
would
be
strapped
to
look
for
and
to
document
events
that
require
it
to
move
or
compel
it
to
move
or
would
set
some...
would
meet
someone
else's
satisfaction
of
when
it
should
move.
and
those
things
may
not
be
present
from
the
information
that
it
might
have
before
it.
the...
and
one
of
the
things
we
think
that...
that
congress
recognized,
that
housing
authorities
are
not
as
well
equipped
as
are
the
federal
government
in
order
to
respond
to
these
types
of
issues,
particularly
with
regard
to
the
loss
of
additional
funds
to
cities.
with
that
in
mind,
it
is
significant
that
this
housing
authority
has
responded
in
the
way
that
it
has
responded.
we...
we
have...
have
listened
to
the
solicitor
general's
discussion
this
morning,
and
we
are
in
accord
with
regard
to
the
position
that
he
has
taken
with
regard
to
what
congress
intended
and
how
congress
went
about
evaluating
the
various
needs
of
residents
of
public
housing.
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
that
needs
to
be
clearly
stated
is
that
the
housing
authority
itself
does
not
benefit
from
a
statute
like
this
because
the
housing
authority
is
only
going
to
take
that
apartment
unit
and
to
re-lease
that
apartment
unit
out
to
someone
else
who
is
in
need
of
low
income
public
housing.
the
housing
authority
has
this
provision
in
its
lease
because,
one,
there...
it's
required
by
the
hud
regulations,
and
number
two,
it
needs
to
be
able
to
provide
its
residents
with
safe
and
decent
housing,
which
is
what
this
is
really
all
about,
is
how
it
goes
about
providing
safe
and
decent
housing.
mr.
gary
t.
lafayette
there
is
nothing
that
restrains
us
from
putting
this
provision
in
this
lease
before
that.
and
in
fact,
prior
to...
though
not
part
of
the
record,
prior
to
this
provision
being
enacted
by
congress,
there
was
a
similar
provision
in
the
lease
itself.
it
just
did
not
embrace
the
concept
of
activity
off
of
housing
authority
property.
the
provision
was
amended
after
the...
after
congress
acted.
mr.
gary
t.
lafayette
in
premises
has
not,
but
in
premises
alone
does
not
address
the
problem
with
regard
to
this
type
of
activity
in
public
housing.
it's
not
unforeseeable
that
individuals
who
participate
in
this
conduct
off
premises
may
not
lead
those
who
have
issues
with
them
onto
housing
authority
property
and
thereby
jeopardize
the
interest
and
the...
the
right
to
enjoyment
of
the
other
residents.
with
that,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for--
mr.
gary
t.
lafayette
--there...
there
isn't
a
procedure
in
place
for
anyone
to
review
these
decisions
based
on
some
arbitrariness
standard.
no,
there
isn't.
mr.
gary
t.
lafayette
if--
mr.
gary
t.
lafayette
--it's
foreseeable
if
there
is
a
constitutional
issue.
if,
for
example,
this...
this
policy
is
only
being
used
against
people
of
a
particular
race--
mr.
gary
t.
lafayette
--then
those
issues
could
be
reviewable.
mr.
gary
t.
lafayette
but--
mr.
gary
t.
lafayette
--that
could
be
and
it
could
be
a
1983
violation
against
the
housing
authority.
mr.
gary
t.
lafayette
it
could
be...
landlord-tenant
disputes
in
california
are
summary
proceedings
which
particularly
dovetail
into
the
issues
in
dispute,
and
it
probably
would
be
a
separate
action
as
a
1983
claim.
but
one
of
the
things
we
don't
have
here
is
a
claim
that
says
that
these
individuals
are
being
singled
out
for
lease
cancellation
because
of
their
race
or
some
other
suspect
classification.
thank
you.
