mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
confronted
with
the
problem,
an
undisputed
problem,
of
severe
violence
and
drug
crimes
and
other
crimes
in
public
housing,
congress
enacted
the
statute
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
statute
provides
that
public
housing
leases
must
provide
that
any
drug-related
criminal
activity
engaged
in
by
a
public
housing
tenant,
any
member
of
the
tenant's
household,
or
any
guest
or
other
person
under
the
tenant's
control
shall
be
cause
for
termination
of
tenancy.
it
sets
forth
the
conditions
by
which
the
household
may
possess
and
occupy
government
property,
property
that
is
largely
financed
by
the
federal
government.
hud
has
construed
that
statute,
in
accordance
with
its
terms,
to
authorize
termination
of
the
tenancy
when
the
drug-related
criminal
activity
by
one
of
the
named
persons
occurs
without
regard
to
the
tenant's
knowledge
or
control.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the...
what
happened
in
the
district
court
in
this
case,
if
i
can
just
answer
it
this
way,
is
there
was
a...
we
suggested
that
the
court
should
abstain,
and
this
whole
thing
should
be
litigated
in
the
local
courts
in
the
unlawful
detainer
action.
the
court
refused
to
do
so
on
the
ground
that
this
was
in
part
an
administrative
procedure
action
against
hud
and
that
hud
wouldn't
have
been
a
party
in
the
local
court.
that
issue
wasn't
raised
further
on
appeal
and
we
didn't
raise
it
in
our
petition
for
cert.
i'm
not
sure
if
that
answers
the
question
or
not,
but...
in
any--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it
is
jurisdictional.
the
question
about
whether
there's
a
cause
of
action
under
the
apa,
for
example,
is
not...
is
not
a
jurisdictional
issue,
nor
is
abstention.
anyway,
hud
has
construed
the
statute
in
accordance
with
its
terms,
to
authorize
termination
of
the
tenancy
when
there's
drug-related
criminal
activity
regardless
of
the
tenant's
knowledge
or
control.
the
court
of
appeals
read
into
the
statute
a
limitation
that
is
nowhere
expressed
or
implied
with
any
of
the
words
that
congress
used,
that
a
tenancy
may
only
be
terminated
when
the
tenant
knew
or
had
reason
to
know
of
the
drug-related
criminal
activity.
the
question--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
but
there's
no...
but
this
is
a
civil...
this
is
a
contract.
it's
a
civil...
it's
a
civil
case.
it's
a
civil
contract.
and
the
law
of
contracts
historically
has
been
that
contractual
terms
can
be
violated
without
regard
to
any
inquiry
into
the
state
of
mind
of
the
contracting
parties.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'm
not
sure...
well,
under
federal
law,
i'm
not
sure.
there
is
now
generally
a
federal
knowledge...
ignorant
owner
defense
under
the
federal
forfeiture
statute.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
state...
in
the
united
states...
in
bennis
against
michigan,
i
don't
think
there
was
such
a...
there
was
such
a
provision.
but
i
think
the
key
point
is
this
is
completely
different
from
forfeiture.
forfeiture
involves
someone
who
has
a
property
interest
that
the
government
had...
has
nothing
to
do
with
and
the
government
is
given
the
right
to
take
that
property
interest.
this
is
a
case
where
the
tenants
never
had
a
property
interest
in
occupancy
of
their...
of
their
apartment
in
violation
of
the
lease.
and
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
government
is
saying
this
is
our
property
and
we're
going
to
let
you
use
it
under
certain...
use
and
occupy
it
under
certain
circumstances.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
i
think
that
is
our
position.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
no.
our
position
is
this
is
fundamentally
different
from
forfeiture.
forfeiture
involves
tens
of
millions
of
leasehold
and
fee
interests
throughout
the
country.
this
involves
a...
a
much
narrower
slice
of
property
interests
in...
of...
of--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
it's
a
fundamentally
different
kind
of
relationship.
this
is
the
government's
property
to
start
off
with.
it
is
saying,
you
can
use
the
property
subject
to
certain
conditions.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
the
tenant's
position...
i
suppose
the
tenant...
you'd
have
to
ask
my
opponent,
but
i
think
the
tenant's
position
here
is
that
this
lease
provision
which
embodies
the...
the
hud
rule
of...
the
rule
that
congress
enacted
concerning
that
there
was
no
innocent
owner
defense,
that
that
is
itself
not
authorized
by
federal
law
or
not
permitted
by
federal
law
and
therefore
was
an
invalid
condition.
i
assume
that
that's
what
their
position
is.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
most...
i
would
say
that
most
of
the
examples
that
are
given
in...
that
are
given
in
the
amicus
briefs
supporting
respondent
are
ones
that
are
based
on
third-hand
hearsay,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
they're
accurate
accounts
of
those
events,
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
the
underlying
point
is
that
congress
was
facing
a
very
serious
problem,
and
it
had
essentially
three
choices.
it
could
have
said,
we
are
going
to
have
a
federal
zero
tolerance
policy
and
that's
all.
it
could
have
done
what
it
did,
which
is
vest
local
public
housing
authorities
with
this
tool,
a
contractual
provision
that
permits
them
to
get
people
out
when
there's
a
serious
problem
or...
or
when...
when
it's
necessary
to
ensure
the
peaceful
enjoyment
of
the
premises
by
the
other
tenant.
or
it
could
have
adopted
a
code
of
under
what
circumstances
you
can
and
can't
evict,
and
then
left
it
up
to
the...
it
would
be
leave...
left
up
to
the
courts
to
see
whether
the
particular
facts
satisfy
that
code
or
don't
satisfy
that
code.
i
think
congress
took
the
only
course
that
was
workable.
if
they...
if
congress
had
gone
farther
and
if
congress
had
enacted
the
statute
that
the
court
of
appeals
thinks
it
enacted,
then
it
would
not
be
much
of
a
tool
for
public
housing
authorities
because
in
each
case,
the
question,
for
example,
of
the
tenant's
knowledge
would
be
litigated.
the
tenant
would
likely
deny
knowledge.
the
household
members
would
deny
knowledge.
the
whole
thing
wouldn't--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that...
that's
correct.
but
the
problem
is
that
in
fact
drug-related
criminal
activity
that
occurs,
for
example,
in
the
parking
lot
of
a
housing
project
can
be
more
threatening
to
the
peaceful
enjoyment
of
the
premises
by
the
other
tenants
than
what
would...
might
occur
in
the
apartment.
and
the
same
with
conduct
that
occurs
nearby.
i
think
the
point
is
that
congress
was
faced
with
it
and
public
housing
authorities
were
faced
with
the
problem
of
very
serious
violence
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
public
housing
projects
in
many
areas
had
become
war
zones
and
drug
markets.
and
they
wanted
a...
a
practical,
effective
way
to
be
sure
that
public
housing
authorities
can
take
those
households
that
are
causing
the
problem
and
remove
them
and
replace
them
with
other
households
of
the
many,
many
households
who
are
on
the
waiting
list
and
who
wouldn't
cause
the
problems.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
there
would
be
because
i
think
congress...
the
way
the
scheme
works
is
this
is
a
provision
in
a
lease
which
is
a
sort
of
contract.
and
there
is...
the
law
of
contracts
is
that
a
contracting
party
may
enforce
its
lease...
its
lease
provisions...
congress
was
surely
aware
of
that...
when
it
wants.
and
ordinarily
whether
it's
a
federal
contract,
a
government
contract,
or
a
private
contract,
the
court
doesn't
inquire
into
what
are
the
reasons
why
you're
enforcing
your...
your
lease
provision
here.
they
just
inquire...
or
your
contractual
provision.
they
just
inquire
has
the
contract
been
breached
or
has
it
not
been
breached.
and
i
think
again
that
that
was
the
only
workable
way
for
this
scheme
to
work.
now,
in
some
instances,
there
may
be
a
public
housing
authority
faced
with
some
of
the
really
extreme
conditions
that
came
out
in
congressional
hearings
and
that
are
discussed
throughout
the
papers
here
that
may
decide
that
a
zero
tolerance
policy
is
the
only
way
to
assure
that
this...
the
drugs
are
going
to
be
cleaned
out
of
the
housing
unit
and
that
the
housing...
the
households
that
are
causing
the
problem
are
going
to
be
replaced
with
some
of
the
other
ones
on
the
waiting
list
that
won't
cause
the
problem.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
there...
there
might
be
other
cases
where
that's
not
appropriate.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
what...
well,
you
know,
i
hesitate
to
say
yes
to
that
because
i
think
what...
our
position
is
that
the
housing
authority
has
the
discretion
to
enforce
these
provisions
or
not,
and
there
may
be
cases
where
zero
tolerance
policy
is
necessary
or
required,
in
which
case
that's
what
they
should
do.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
they...
it
could
say
zero
tolerance
across
the
board.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct
because
you...
with
respect
to
the
particular
issue
of
knowledge
that's
at
issue
here,
as
i
said,
it's
going
to
be
very
hard
for
a
housing
authority,
which
is
not
a
criminal
prosecution
agency...
they're
in
the
business
of
running
housing...
housing
developments,
not
prosecuting
crimes...
to
prove
who
had
exactly
what
state
of
mind
or
who
had
what
level
of
control.
indeed,
both
respondents
in
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
that
if
the
tenant...
even
if
the
tenant
knew,
if
the
tenant
couldn't
control
the
drug-related
activity,
that
that
would
also
be
a
defense.
well,
that
would,
in
some
cases,
allow
exactly
the
families
and
the
households
that
are
causing
the
biggest
problem
for
the...
for
their...
for
their
neighbors
and
for
the
truly
innocent
tenants
to
remain,
and
there
would
be
nothing
the
public
housing
authority
could
do.
but
i
think,
in
general,
what
congress
wanted
was
to
give
public
housing
authorities
a
tool
that
would
be
actually
useful
in
remedying
the
very
serious
problem
of
not
only
drug...
drug-related
criminal
activity
but
other
criminal
activity
in
public
housing
units.
the
underlying
principle
really
is
one
of
household-wide
responsibility.
no
one...
no
one
suggests
that
if
the...
everybody
agrees,
let
me
put
it
that
way,
that
if
the
tenant
is...
engages
in
drug-related
criminal
activity,
that
the
whole
household
can
be
removed
from
the
unit.
but
in
a
very
real
sense,
although
the
legal
relationship
is
between
the
housing
authority
and
the
tenant,
the
practical
relationship
is
they're
giving
that
whole
household
the
right
to
occupy
the
government
premises.
and
it's
just
the
very
same
rule.
it's
whoever
in
that
household
has
used...
has
engaged
in
criminal
drug-related
activity,
that
person
is
liable
to
be
removed
from
the
tenancy
because
it...
that
person
violated
a
lease
term.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
in
terms
of
time,
i
think
that
there...
generally
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
time,
and
i
think
it
would
be
open
to
hud
to
fill
in
a...
in
a
gap,
although
certainly
a
very
broad
period
of
time
would
be...
would
be
suggested.
it
wouldn't
be
a
very
short--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's...
that's
correct,
but
that...
that...
it
was
not...
the
issue
of
time
and
place...
and
let
me
say
place
is
addressed
in
the
statute
because
congress...
originally
it
said
on
or
near,
and
congress
amended
in
1996
to
say
on
or
off.
so,
the
one
thing
we
do
know
is
that
place
is
not
something
that
was
relevant.
and
again...
actually
if
i
can
turn
to
place
for
a
second,
you
could
have
a
drug
crime
that
occurs
3,000
miles
away,
and
ordinarily...
and
i
think
it
would
never
be...
i
don't
know
of
any
case
where
anyone
has
been
tried
to
be
evicted.
it's
a
very
theoretical
possibility
that
anybody
would
be.
but
if
that
crime
was
that
that
person
was
trying
to
import
drugs
and
bring
them
to
that
person's
unit
in
the
housing
complex,
it
would
be
highly
relevant.
and
what
congress
intended
was
that
public
housing
authorities
have
the
tool
to
take
care
of
the
problems
that
they
saw.
they're
not
evicting
people
who
are...
who
are
engaged
in
drug
crimes
3,000
miles
away
or
20
years
before.
respondents
rely
and
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
forfeiture
provision.
i've
already
said
that
the
forfeiture
raises
a
completely
different
issue.
and
the
fact
that...
it
is
true
that
congress
added
leasehold
interest
to
the
forfeiture
statute
in
it...
when
it...
when
it
rewrote
this
statute
in
1990,
although
it
didn't
substantively
change
the
terms
of
the
statute.
but
i
think
the...
it's
very
express
innocent
owner
defense
that's
in
the
lease...
in
the
forfeiture
statute
contrasts
very
sharply
with
the
absence
of
not
only
any
such
defense
but
even
any
word
that
suggests
such
a
defense
in
this
statute.
the
doctrine
of
in
pari
materia,
which
they
appeal
to,
can
sometimes
be
used
where
you
have
a
particular
term
in
a
statute
that
in
a
closely
related
statute
is
either
defined
or,
by
context,
has
a
very
clear
meaning
and
the
same
meaning
then
is...
is
imported.
it's
quite
a
different
thing
here
where...
this
is
a...
the
forfeiture
statute
is
entirely
different
from--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
and...
and
i
think
in
this
case
where
there's
no
word
in
this
statute
that
requires
that...
that
requires
interpretation
and
the
context
that
you're
trying
to
take
the
meaning
from
is
quite
a...
an
entirely
different
context,
i
don't
think
that
that
in
pari
materia
is
soundly
applied.
in
fact,
i
think
just
the
contrast
between
the
statutes
clearly
points
out
congress'...
what
congress
intended.
the...
the...
you
know,
i'd
add
that
this...
this...
the
rationale
of
this
statute
ensures
not
only
that
there's
the
maximum
incentive
for
tenants
in
public
housing
to
ensure
that
their
household
members
and
they
themselves
are
not
engaged
in
drug-related
activity
and
to
find
out
about
that
activity
rather
than
remaining
ignorant,
but
in
the
end,
it
ensures
that
households
in
government
subsidized
housing
who
are
a
threat
to
their
neighbors
or
who
may
be
a
threat
to
their
neighbors
in
the
view
of
the
public
housing
authority,
that
they
are
removed
and
that...
and
replaced
with
others
of
the
many
families
who
are
on
the
list
who
would
not
pose
such
a
threat.
finally,
the
court
of
appeals
also
relied
on
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
avoidance,
but
this
statute
is
clear
and
there's
no
warrant
for
applying
that
doctrine.
and
in
any
event,
there
isn't
any
serious
constitutional
problem
with
interpreting
it
as
hud
has.
although
the
tenants
have
a
property
interest
in
their
lease,
that
is...
that
entitles
them
to
the
right
to
the
full
procedural
due
process
protections
before
the
lease
is
terminated,
but
it
doesn't
govern
what
the
substantive
terms
of
the
lease
are.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right,
and
they
have
the
right
to
litigate
all
of
the
issues
that
would
come
up
in
the
unlawful
detainer
action,
but
it
doesn't...
the...
the
fact
that
they
have
a
property
interest
in
their
lease
doesn't,
in
turn,
give
them
a
property
interest
in
acting
in
ways
substantively
that
are
contrary
to
the
terms
of
their
lease.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you.
i'd
first
like
to
add
that
the...
the
people...
the
people
who
had
committed
the
drug
offenses
in
this
case
were
between
ages
20
and
44
years
old.
they
weren't
teenagers.
the
question
of...
as
to
the
relationship
of...
of
federal
law
and
the...
the
federal
law
that
waives...
that
permits
hud
to
waive
the
grievance
procedure
in
the
housing
authority
and
say
you
can
just
go
to
the
eviction
court...
and
that
law
does
provide
that
hud
has
to...
it
can
only
permit
that
if
it
can
ensure...
assure
that
the
eviction
court
gives
you
full
due
process
rights
to
litigate
whatever
issues
there
are.
and
in
that
sense,
federal
law
does
guarantee
you
the
right
to
have
all
of
your
defenses
litigated
in
the
eviction
proceeding
if
hud
is
going
to
grant
such
a
waiver,
which
it's
done
in
47
states.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
but
what
federal
law
doesn't
do
is
say
that
there's
any
particular
defenses.
as
the
question
of
what
the
defenses
are
that
you
have
to
have
the
full
right
to
litigate,
that's
a
question
of...
of
substantive
federal
law.
now,
in
this
case,
the
statute
makes
clear
i
think
that
serious...
that
drug-related
criminal
activity
is
cause
for
termination
of
tenancy,
and
hud
has
construed
it
to
mean
that.
now,
the
question
then
about...
the
only
possible
source
for
a
defense
would
be
state
law,
and
the
question
about
for
state
law
defense
would
be
does
that
conflict
with
either
the
federal
statute
or
the
purposes
congress
was
trying
to
achieve.
it
wouldn't
be
possible
for
a
state
court
to
disagree
with
the
balance
that
congress
struck
when
it...
when
it
passed
the
statute.
so,
the
only
question
would
be,
therefore,
if
you
have
any
state
law
defenses,
they
would
have
to
be
ones
that
don't
conflict
with
the
judgment
that
congress
made
that
eviction
under
1437d(l)(6)
is
for
serious...
it's
for
drug...
drug-related
criminal
activity
by
a
household
member.
i'd
like
to
add
just
one
other
point
which
is
in
42
u.s.c.,
section
1437,
which
is
kind
of
the
statement
of
policy
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
united
states
housing
act,
it
says,
it
is
the
policy
of
the
united
states...
and
it
names
a
bunch
of
things,
which
i'm
not
going
to
read.
and
it
says,
to
vest
in
local
public
housing
agencies
the
maximum
amount
of
responsibility
in
the
administration
of
their
housing
programs.
it
was
those
local
public
housing
agencies
that
know
what
the
conditions
are,
and
that...
it
is
consistent
with
that
that
hud
has
construed
the
statute
and
congress
in
fact
enacted
the
statute
to
give
them
the
discretion
with
this
clause,
as
with
enforcement
of
rent
clauses
or
any
other
clause,
to
decide
when
they
should
be
enforced
and
when
they
should
be
enforced.
that's
not
a
role
for
the
eviction
court.
thank
you.
