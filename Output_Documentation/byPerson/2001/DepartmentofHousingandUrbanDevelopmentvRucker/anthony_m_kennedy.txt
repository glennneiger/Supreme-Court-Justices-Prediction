do
you
have
any
question
about
the
respondent's
standing
to
contest
the
provisions
that...
of
a
lease
that's
made
between
hud
and
the
housing--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
guess
i'm
still...
i
guess
i'm
still
puzzled
by
why
a
tenant
can
sign
a
lease
and
then
challenge
it.
i
mean,
what's
the...
is...
is
he
saying
that
federal
law
that
binds
the
housing
authority
is
somehow
invalid?
and
how
does
he
have
standing
to
do
that
if
the
housing
authority
agrees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
take
the
position
that
you
could
have
this
provision
in
the
lease
even
without
the
federal
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
as
the
chief
justice
points
out,
that's
true
in...
i've
drafted
many
leases
and
we
have
clauses--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
this
premises
is
used
for
commercial
purposes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
lease
is
void
and
that's...
and
that's
it.
now,
you
may
say
that...
you
can
argue
about
whether
or
not
the...
the
provision
itself
was
violated,
but
i
know
of
no
authority
where
it
says
where
the
lessor
can't
exercise
this
option.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
just
don't
have
before
us
a
question
in
which
you're
contesting
that
the
drug
activity
occurred.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
is
a
legal
defense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
only
question
before
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
it's
irrelevant
that
the
tenants
signed
a
contract
which
specifically
provides
this
in
the...
in
the
rider.
it's
at
page
69a
of
the
appendix.
you
think
that
that's
just
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
frankly
don't
understand
your...
your
standing
to
contest
the
housing
authority's
interpretation
of
a
hud
regulation
anyway.
you
just
signed
a
lease
that...
that
hud
gave
you
and
that's
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
a
different...
now
that
ninth...
that's...
finally
you're
talking
about
something
the
ninth
circuit
talked
about,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
just
absolutely
dead
wrong.
page
69
of
the
appendix
has
a
rider,
a
supplemental
provision
of
some
kind,
which
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
there
is
no
innocent
defense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
now...
now
you're
skating
away
from
the
point
where
we
were
finally
at
issue.
you
said
the
lease
doesn't
provide
this,
and...
but
now
your
answer
is,
well,
even
if
it
did,
it
shouldn't.
i
mean,
that's
just...
that's
just
not
responsive
to
my
point.
