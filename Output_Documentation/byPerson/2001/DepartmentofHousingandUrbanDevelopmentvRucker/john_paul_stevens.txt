justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question,
if
you're
through?
is
there
any
procedure
at
all
to...
i'm
pointing...
i'm
referring
to
the
fact
that
the
housing
authority
has
such
broad
discretion.
they
can
not
only
make
charges,
but
they
can
decide
to
waive
them.
is
there
any
procedure
at
all
to
be
sure
that
that
power
isn't
abused
by
waiving
it
in
cases
of
all
democrats
but
enforcing
it
for
all
republicans
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
landlord
have
some
duty
to
provide
a
secure...
a
secure
premises,
i.e.,
secure
from
drug
use?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
hypothesizing
an
exercise
of
discretion
by
hud
that's
just
not
in
the
record.
