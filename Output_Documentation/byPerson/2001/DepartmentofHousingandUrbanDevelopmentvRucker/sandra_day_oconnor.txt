--is
it
your
position
that
the
government
can
place
any
terms
and
conditions
whatever
on
leases
as
long
as
it
doesn't
violate
some
other
constitutional
provision
like
the
first
amendment?

and
so
this
is
a
condition
that
the
government
has
the
right
to
impose.
is
that
your
basic
position?

you
don't
need
reliance

the
position
of
the
government
in...
in
saying
that
any
misuse
by
any
guest,
whether
on
or
off
the
premises,
will
result
in
a
forfeiture
does
seem
to
operate
in
a
rather
draconian
fashion
in
some
of
the
examples
we've
been
given
in
the
briefs.
and
one
wonders
why
the
government
wants
to
take
such
a...
an
extreme
position
even
though
it
lawfully
could.
justice

well,
but
if
they
are,
they
sound
pretty
draconian.
justice

but
that
was
not
required
of
the
housing
authority,
and
if
they
had
gone
and
said,
well,
we
don't
care
that
circumstances
have
changed,
out
you
go,
that
would
be
unreviewable.
justice

but
it's
not
recognized
in
the
federal
statute
or
in
the
regulations.
that's
the
problem.
this
is
manufactured
by
the
ninth
circuit.
it
isn't
there.
justice
sandra

but
these
tenants
didn't
let
it
get
to
that
stage.
they
preempted
it
and
filed
some
kind
of
a
suit
to
get
an
injunction
before
there
had
ever
been
a
proceeding.
