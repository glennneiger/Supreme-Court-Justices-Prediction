justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
feldman,
how
can
you
say
that's
so
when
the
district
court...
the
injunction
was
he's
drawing
a
line
between
on
premises
and
off
premises.
and
the
injunction
doesn't
cover
anything
that
happens
on
the
premises.
as
far
as
that's
concerned,
the
eviction
holds.
so,
it's
only
the
cases
where
the
third
person
does
a
drug
deal
or
whatever
off
premises.
and
we
had
one
case
in
the
parking
lot,
another
case
in
a
bar.
but
as
far
as
inside
the
premises,
there
is
no
case
being
made.
there's...
nobody
is
saying
that...
at
least
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
district
judge
didn't
go
far
enough.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say
this
is...
a
housing
authority
may
not
must.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
think
in
your
brief,
as
well
as
in
judge
o'scannlain's
opinion
for
the
original
panel,
there
was
a
suggestion
that
the
housing
authority
should
be
equitable
in
the
way
it
administers
it,
that
it
shouldn't
evict
every
time
it
theoretically
could.
and
my
question
to
you
is,
in
recommending
that
kind
of
equitable
discretion
to
be
exercised,
do
you
envision
that
to
be
an
unreviewable
discretion
or
would
there
be
court
review
of
the
housing
authority's
determination,
say,
in
these
cases
not
to
exercise
equitable
discretion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
did
take
the
position
that
here
and
now
with
this,
that
the
housing
authority
should
not
evict
automatically,
that
they
should
do
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
or
am
i
wrong
in
saying--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
feldman,
how
do
you
answer
that
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
duration
of
time
or
the
place?
i
mean,
the
hypothetical
that
the...
let's
say
the
grandson
could
have
dealt
with
drugs
5
years
ago
or
could
have
done
it
in
l.a.
and
this
housing
project
is
in
massachusetts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
saying
the
part
of
the
unreviewable
discretion
is
it
could
be
5
years
ago.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that...
that
in
premises
has
not...
has
never
been
an
issue
in
this
case,
i
take
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what?
in
a
1983
action
against
the
housing
authority?
is
that
what...
what
would...
how
would
it
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
it
come
from
in
the
first
place?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
are
going
considerably
beyond
where
the
district
court
left
off.
and
the
district
court
made
a
distinction
between
on
premises
and
off
premises,
and
it
didn't
give
any
injunction
with
respect
to
on
premises.
your
argument
doesn't
have
that
limitation.
your
argument
is
equitable
defense
of
innocence;
i
didn't
know.
and
it
doesn't
draw
any
line
at
all
between
in
and
off
premises.
so,
you
are
asking
this
court
to
take...
to
state
a
rule
of
law
that
would
go
considerably
beyond
the
district
court
injunction
that
was
then
reviewed
by
the
ninth
circuit.
you're
asking
us,
in...
in
effect,
to
reverse
the
district
court
because
it
didn't
go
far
enough,
if
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
object
in
the
ninth
circuit
because
the
district
court
didn't
go
far
enough?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
very
odd
procedural
posture
you're
in.
you're
trying
to
overturn
your
victory
in
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say
there's
no
logical
line
that
one
could
draw.
on
your...
if
your
theory
is
innocent
tenant
is
a
defense,
then
how
can
you
defend
that
defense
for
off
premises
only?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
district
court
said
the...
there
is
no
problem
with
on
premises.
off
premises
is
what's
unreasonable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
there's
no
difference
at
all.
so,
it
would
be
just
as
arbitrary.
i
mean,
if...
if
you
say
innocent...
innocence
is
the
defense,
the
innocent
tenant,
then
whether
it's
preliminary
injunction
or
permanent
injunction,
it's
a
line
that
you
say
cannot
logically
stand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you're
challenging
something
that
you
have,
as
i
see
it,
no
standing
to
raise
in
this
court
because
i
looked
back
at
the
district
court's
opinion,
and
what
it
said
as
to
conduct
occurring
in
the
tenant's
union...
unit...
it
didn't
say,
well,
we
just
won't
extend
it
preliminarily.
it
said,
eviction
under
such
circumstances
appears
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
public
housing
goal
and
constitutional.
it
was
a
ruling
on
the
merits
that
as
far
as
the
in
premises
setting
is
concerned,
it
was
constitutional.
and
you're
arguing
that
that's
not
the
case,
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
argue
that
when
you
haven't
filed
any
cross
appeal
ever.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
judgment
below
that's
being
affirmed
deals
only
with
off
premises.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
not
making
a
distinction
between
a
judgment
and
an
opinion?
i
mean,
what
was
affirmed
was
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
that
preliminary
injunction
was
only
with
respect
to
off
premises
activity,
and
that's
all
that
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
