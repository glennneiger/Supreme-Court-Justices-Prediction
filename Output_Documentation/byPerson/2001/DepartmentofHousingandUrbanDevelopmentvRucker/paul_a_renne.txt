mr.
paul
a.
renne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
as
we've
heard
in...
in
the
argument
of
hud
is
that
hud
says,
by
reason
of
this
lease
provision,
which
congress
mandated
in
section
1437d(l)(6),
it
is
the
judge
and
jury
as
to
whether
or
not
innocent
tenants,
such
as
the...
the
respondents
who
are
before
this
court,
whether
they
can
be
summarily
evicted
from
their
homes.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
yes,
your...
chief
justice,
it
does
because
what
they're
saying
is
that
there
can
be
no
defenses
raised
in
the
eviction
proceeding
other
than
an
attack
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
drug-related
violation.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
justice
kennedy,
under
most
state
laws,
the
eviction
court
has
a
right
to
make
a
determination
whether
under
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
to...
to
terminate
the
lease
would
be,
for
example,
a
forfeiture
because
of
the
violation
not
being
sufficient
or
the
circumstances
such
as...
that
don't
bring
it
under
those
terms.
now,
what...
and
interesting
enough,
we
heard
nothing
about
it,
but
congress
also
mandated--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--yes,
but
the
congress
mandated
that
in
any
action
taken
to
evict,
hud,
or
the
oakland
housing
authority
in
this
case,
had
to
provide
some
grievance
mechanism
of
an
independent
evaluation
whether
eviction
should
occur.
however,
it
said
that
hud
can
grant
due
process
exemptions
under
the
circumstances
where
hud
makes
an
affirmative
determination
that
the
eviction
court
provides
due
process
to
the
tenant.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
yes.
the...
the
ninth
circuit
talks
in
terms
of
the...
of
the
opportunity
to
present
defenses.
now,
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
going
on,
it
was
saying
that
there's
nothing
in
the
statute...
and
it
was
congress'
intent
not
to
take
away
an
innocent
tenant
defense.
and
that
would
be
presented
to
the
eviction
court.
and
congress
has
provided
for
the
eviction
court
to
have
a
right
to
hear
all
legal
and
equitable
defenses.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
well,
it...
it
is,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
what
the
ninth
circuit
is
saying.
the
ninth
circuit
is
saying
that
that
section
does
not
take
away
an
innocent
tenant
defense.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
the
innocent
tenant
defense?
mr.
paul
a.
renne
from
the...
the
statute
which
provides
that
in
eviction
proceedings,
the
eviction
court
shall
provide
an
opportunity
for
the
tenant
to
present
all
legal
and
equitable
defenses.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
that's
correct.
and,
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
a
legal
defense
that
is
recognized
in
most
state
court
proceedings.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
the...
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
defenses.
the
statute
is
only
saying
here's
a
lease
provision
that
you
shall
put
into
the
lease.
hud's
own
regulations
say,
if
you
want
to
enforce
it,
you
have
to
go
to
an
eviction
court,
and
the
eviction
court
has
a
right
to
consider
all
equitable
legal
defenses.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
that's
correct.
and
that
was
on
the
point
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the...
of
what
power
congress
had
given
hud
to
interpret
the
statute
which
is
totally
silent.
it
says
nothing
about
defenses.
and
when
you
look
at
what
happened
at
the
same
time
when
congress
enacted
that
particular
provision
in
1988,
it
was
the
same
time
in
which
it
took
public
housing
leases,
put
them
under
the
forfeiture
statute,
and
said
under
forfeiture
statutes,
you
must
provide
an
innocent
tenant
defense.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
i...
i
submit
the
reason
why
they
didn't
is
because
landlord-tenant
law
is
a...
in
public
housing
is
a
amalgamation
of
federal
and
state
law,
and
that's
well
recognized
in
all
the
cases.
they
knew,
at
the
time
that
they
passed
section
1437d(l)(6),
that
there
was
also
the
provisions
that
said
legal
and
equitable
defenses
may
be
presented.
they
were
not...
they
were
not
focusing
on
what
defenses
are
available.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
they
appear
in
hud's
regulations.
in
the...
they
can
only
grant
a
due
process
exemption
if
they
find
that
the
state
eviction
court
gives
the
tenant
an
opportunity
to
present
legal
and
equitable
defenses.
congress,
when
it
was
passes...
passing
section
1437--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--absolutely.
whatever
defenses
are
recognized
by
the
eviction
court.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
i
believe
you
are
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
that
we
believe
that
that
defense
of
a
totally
innocent
tenant
should
be
available
whether
the
offense
occurred
off
or
on
the
premises
just
as
it
does
in
the
forfeiture
statute.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
i'm
not
trying
to
overturn
it,
your
honor,
i
suggest,
but
i
would
be
perfectly
happy
if
this
court
addressed
just
the
off
premises,
which
is
what
the
district
court
held.
but
the
whole--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--the...
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
draw
that
line
either.
the
ninth
circuit
took
the
position
that
the
innocent
tenant
defense
was
not
precluded
and
in
fact
was
preserved
under
that--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
what
the
district
court
said
is,
i'm
not
going
to
issue
an
injunction
for
on
premises.
might
i
respectfully
submit
what
the
court
was
saying
there
was
that
the
balancing
and
the
clearness
of
the
likelihood
of
prevailing
was
not
necessarily
clear
as
he
felt
it
was
at
the...
at
the
off
premises,
so
that
in
the
context
of
a
preliminary
injunction,
he
did
not
make
a
ruling
as
a
matter
of
law
at
the
end
of
the
day
that
that...
that
he
would
adhere
to
the
position
that
he
was
taking
for
purposes
of
the
injunction.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
on
the
facts
that
were
before
the
district
court
judge,
all
he
had
to
deal
with,
for
purposes
of
the
injunction,
was
the...
the
off
premises.
and
i
respectfully
submit
it's
not
a
final
judgment
that
he
was
addressing.
he
was
addressing
what's
the
likelihood
of
success.
admittedly...
and
i
don't...
i
think
we
all
recognize
that
if
there's
an
offense
on
the
premises,
the
likelihood
of
a
innocent
tenant
defense
being
successful
is
far
less,
but
in
the
case
where
you
have
someone,
like
the
three
female
respondents
in
this
case
who
are
long-time
tenants
who
have
had
no
problems...
and
certainly
the
oakland
housing
authority
is
not
arguing
they
had
problems
with
them...
and
you
have
a
grandson
who
smokes
cigarettes
in
the
parking
lot,
and
hud
takes
a
position...
and
oakland
housing
authority
takes
a
position
that
we
can
apply
some
kind
of
collective
guilt
because,
regardless
of
what
the
government
wants
to
say
and
characterize
it
as
a
contract
action,
the
end
result
to
these
three
respondents
and
the
innocent...
innocent
members
of
the
household
is
to
throw
them
into
the
streets.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
no,
justice
kennedy,
it's
not
irrelevant.
the--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--the...
the
question
is...
and
i
think
the
contract
question
is
way
circular,
that
if...
if
congress
did
not
mandate
that
it's
an
automatic
eviction
with
no
opportunity
to
present
any
kind
of
a
defense,
if
congress
didn't
mandate
it,
the
fact
that
it's
in
the
lease
doesn't
change
it.
you
still
have
to
get
to...
the
question
is
did
section
1437d(l)(6)...
did
it
mandate?
and
it
would
be
the
only
section
of
the
lease.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
the...
but
it's
also,
in
its
regulations,
said
that
the
tenant
has
a
right
in
the
eviction
court
to
present
equitable
and
legal
defenses.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
i
respectfully
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
not
what
they
litigated.
they
litigated
that
they
did
not
have
a
right
to
terminate...
to
terminate
an
innocent
tenant,
not
to
put
that
in
their
lease.
that...
there's
nobody
saying
that
they
can't
put
the
provision
in
their
lease.
the
question
is...
and...
and
nobody
is
disputing
that
there
is
a
serious
problem
of
drugs
in
public
housing,
and
we
aren't...
we
aren't
suggesting
anything
to
the
contrary.
but
i
suggest
that
the
respondents
and
the
way
they're
being
treated
by
the
oakland
housing
authority
are
making
them
victims
as
well.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
but
again,
with
all
due
respect,
that's
assuming
the
answer,
and
that
is
that
the
lease
does
say
that
you
can't
present
an
innocent
tenant
defense.
and
again
i
go
back
to--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--but
the...
if
you
are
suggesting
that
the
tenant
has
any
choice
in
a
public
housing
situation
in
which
the...
the
only
choice
of
housing
they
have
is
public
housing,
to
say
that
somehow
or
other
they
have
agreed
to
a
provision
which
congress
didn't
require.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
my...
justice
kennedy,
what
i
was
saying
is
that
section
1437
of
the...
of
the
statute
didn't
require
the
language
that
they
are
putting
in.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
and
i
believe--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--i
address
that
in
three
ways.
one
is
that
i
believe
that
when
you
look
at
the
circumstances
under
which
that
section
was
passed
in
conjunction
with
881,
the
forfeiture
statute,
you
look
at
the...
what
little
comments
were
made
by
any
committees
that
were
addressing
it,
and
when
you
look
at
the
alleged
rationale,
none
of
them
support
hud.
but
even
more
basic,
if
you
accept
hud's
interpretation,
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
raises
serious
constitutional
issues.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
the
due
process
issues,
your
honor,
in
that
what
they
are
threatening
to
do
is
to
attach
punishment
and
collective
guilt,
and
in
american
jurisprudence,
we
always
put
individual--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--you
are
certainly
being
punished,
and
rucker
being
thrown
out
in
the
street
is
certainly
being
punished.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
and
it's
because
the
tenant
has
supposedly
violated
and
the
eviction
court
has
found,
based
upon
all
the
evidence
that
it
hears,
that
eviction
is
appropriate.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
under
these
circumstances,
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
in...
for
the
same
reason
that
i
believe
this
court
has
at
least
indicated
in...
in
dicta,
that
when
you
are
essentially
seizing
what
is
property,
particularly
somebody's
home,
you
must
afford
them
due
process
including--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--and
substantively
is
that
you
are...
you
are
punishing
without
any
guilt
and
without
allowing
the
tenant
to
establish
that
he
or
she
is
innocent.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
not
in
public
housing--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--in
the
public
housing
situation.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
well,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
the
cases
in
this
court
have
said
that
respondents
are
entitled
to
rely
on
anything
that
would
affirm
the
judgment
below.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
it's
the
ninth
circuit
judgment
that
is
being
attacked,
and
the
ninth
circuit
does
not
limit
itself
in
terms
of
the
arguments
that
it
raises
and
it...
conclusions
it
reached--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--what
was
affirmed
was
the
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
yes,
i
don't
disagree
with
that
at
all.
but
the
rationale
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
applies
with
equal
force
because
the
only
thing
they
had
before
them
is
whether
or
not
the
district
court
had
abused
its
discretion
in
the
grant
of
preliminary
injunction.
but
continuing
to
address
the...
the
due
process
is
that
all
we
are
saying
is
that
these
tenants
have
a
right
to
establish
that
they
should
not
be
punished
by
reason
of
somebody
else's
conduct
without
a
showing--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--well,
i
don't
think
that...
when
you
say
it
seems
to
be
obvious,
with
all
due
respect
again,
i
would
say
they
talk
about
deterrent.
it
seems
to
me
that
ms.
pearlie
rucker
who
took
steps
to
assure
that
there
were
no
violations,
told
her
daughter
there
were
no...
what
the
problems
were,
and
as
far
as
she
knew,
knew
nothing
about
what
happened
three
blocks
away
from
the
apartment.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
and--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--i
suggest
that
we
took...
we
take...
compare
it
to
the
forfeiture
statute
where
we
have
specifically...
congress
has
mandated
that
in
the
forfeiture
situation
where
the
drug
offense
can
be...
on
the
premises
can
be
horrible,
it
can
be
a
very
serious
drug
offense,
and
they
cannot
forfeit
the
tenancy.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
and
the...
the...
it's
not...
this
court
has
held
it
is
not--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--if
there's
a
nexus
either
because
the
automobile
was
used--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--well,
i...
i
think
the
courts
recognized
that
it
is
her
premises.
it's
her
home
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it's
a
public
housing
or
it's
private.
and
as
i
believe
that
this
court
has
commented
in
opinions
that
you
don't
forfeit
a
house
if
somebody
smokes
one
marijuana
cigarette
in
it--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--even
though
it
may
have
occurred
on
the
premises.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
well,
881
talks
specifically
about
public
housing
leases
as
being
subject
to
forfeiture.
so,
you
are...
in
those
contexts
you're
talking
about
the
identical
situation
that
under
the
forfeiture
statute
somebody
could
come
in
to
ms.
rucker,
if
she
violated
some
criminal
law...
could
come
and
try
to
forfeit
it.
but
it's
much
easier.
let's
get
the
oakland
housing
authority
to
come
in
here
and
we
don't
have
to
show
she
knew
anything
about
it.
she
could
be
perfectly
innocent,
and
that
is,
we
submit
is
fundamentally
unfair.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
yes.
and
i...
and
i
submit
that
easily
enough
to
do
as
they
said...
as...
as
counsel
said
with
ms.
rucker.
they
said,
we
withdrew
the
unlawful
detainer
action,
although
i
might
say
they
didn't
withdraw
the
eviction
notice,
but
they
withdrew
the
unlawful
detainer
action
when
the
individual
who
was
involved
was
separated
from
the
premises.
that's
what
we
respectfully
submit
is...
that's
the
easy
problem
in
the
innocent
tenant
case,
is
to
go
to
that
tenant
or
to
have
the
tenant
come
to
hud
and
say,
look,
i've
got
a
problem.
my
son
is...
is
into
marijuana
and
he
won't
listen
to
me.
i
want
him
removed.
take
him
off
the
household
list.
now,
is
she
going
to
do
it
confronted
with
the
fact
that
hud
could
say
or
oakland
housing
authority
could
say,
well,
sorry,
ms.
rucker,
rather
than
ask
your
daughter
to
go
off,
we're
going
to
throw
you
out?
why
would
she
ever
go
there?
mr.
paul
a.
renne
right.
mr.
paul
a.
renne
and...
and
the
best
way
for...
to
make
sure
that
that
doesn't
happen,
that
is,
that
no
one
on
her
household
violates
a
drug
law
or...
remember,
the
statute
doesn't
just
relate
to
drugs.
it
relates
to
criminal
activity.
and
as
the
amicus
briefs
point
out,
there...
and...
that
there
are
spouses
who
are
being
evicted
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
they're
subject
to
spousal
abuse
which
violates
the
criminal
law.
and...
and
all
we're
saying
is
they
have
to
have
a
chance
to
go
to
the
eviction
court
and
present
that
to
the
eviction
court
so
that
the
eviction
court
has
a
right
to
deal
with
whether
or
not
there
is
good
cause.
and
it's
interesting
in
the...
in
the
statute
we're
talking
about
there
is
a...
in
section
5,
it
talks
about
repeated,
constant
violations
and
other
good
cause.
when
you
get
to
6,
it
only
talks
about
shall
be
a
cause
for
eviction.
good
cause
is
the
thing
the
eviction
court
should
have
a
right
to
deal
with,
and
there's
nothing
that
said
the
state
law
was
being
preempted.
i'm
suggesting
that
if...
if
what
hud
wants
is
to
have
voluntary
cleanup
by
good
people
like
ms.
rucker
and
ms.
hill,
ms.
lee,
they
should
encourage
them
to
say,
give
us
help
to
make
sure
that
we
can
live
with
that
because
i
think
we
all
know
in
the
real
world
you're
talking
about
teenage
grandsons,
people
who
you
don't
know
exactly
what
they're
doing
from
time
to
time,
and
for...
for
a
grandmother
to
be
told
the
only
way
you
can
assure
yourself
is
make
sure
nobody
else
lives
here,
it's
the
only
way
that...
that
these
people
can
assure
themselves
that
they
aren't
going
to
get
thrown
out--
mr.
paul
a.
renne
--all
right.
thank
you.
