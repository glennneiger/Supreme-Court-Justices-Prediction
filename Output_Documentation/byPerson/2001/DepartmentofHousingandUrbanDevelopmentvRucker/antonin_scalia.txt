justice
antonin
scalia
--is
the...
is
the
issue
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
read
scienter
requirements
into
criminal
statutes
with
some
regularity,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
about
other
civil
forfeiture
actions?
are
you
familiar
with
any...
any
others
of
those
that
don't
contain
a
scienter
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
i
mean,
in
the
precise
instance
that
justice
stevens
gave
you,
that
would
be
a
constitutional
violation,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you...
you
would
have
judicial
review
for...
for
violation
of
some
constitutional
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
it
say
that
here?
i
mean,
you...
this
suggests
that
when
congress
said
nothing
about
the
defense
here,
it
meant
the
defense
didn't
exist.
where
it
wanted
the
defense--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
specified
it.
and
you
say
they
say
nothing
about
it.
they
say
nothing
about
it
because
it
didn't
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
provisions
are...
that
say
legal
and
equitable
defense
can
be
presented
are...
appear
in
federal
law
or
in
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
this
is
an
authorization
for
all
sorts
of
defenses?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
she
didn't
take
enough
steps
under
the
lease.
under
the
lease
she
assured
the
housing
authority
that
her
premises
would
not
be
the
site
of
drug
activity
nor
would
anybody
who
brought
drug
activity
into
the
housing...
into
the
environs
of
the
housing
authority
be
residing
in
her--
justice
antonin
scalia
--now,
she
could
do
that,
and
you're
saying
she
was
blameless.
well,
perhaps
she
was
blameless,
but
she
didn't
do
what
she
had
committed
to
do,
and
that
is
to
make
sure
that
nobody
in
her
apartment
caused
that
place
to
be
a
drug
area.
there
seems
to
me
nothing
unconstitutional
about
that,
saying
we're
going
to
let
you
in
here
if
you
assure
us
that
no
one
who
resides
in
the...
in
the
premises
that
we're
giving
you
under
this
program
will
be
the
source
of
a
drug
problem.
what's
unconstitutional
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
has
said
that.
you
think
congress
had
to
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
goodness.
i...
there
are
many
instances
under
state
law
where
you
forfeit
an
automobile
which
is
being
used
for
contraband
even
if
you
do
not
know
that
it's
being
used.
it's
your
responsibility
to
make
sure
your
car
is
not
used
for
contraband.
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
your
car.
and...
and
what
the
state
says
is
when
you
have
a
car,
it's
your
responsibility
to
make
sure
it's
not
used
for
contraband,
and
if
it
is,
we
take
it
away.
that's
not
unconstitutional.
why
is
this
any
different?
in
fact,
this
is
a
good
deal
less
because
it's
not
even
her
premises.
it
is
a
condition
of
giving
her
this
benefit.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
housing
authority
wants
to
put
the
responsibility
on
her.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wants
to
put
the
responsibility
on
the
tenants
to
make
sure
that
they
are
not
being
the
cause
of
a
drug
problem
in
the
facility.
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
reasonable,
and
if
she...
if
she
has
been
at
fault
in
not
doing
that
or
even
in
all
innocence
hasn't
done
it
properly,
nonetheless,
she
hasn't
fulfilled
her
obligation
under
the
lease,
which
is
to
make
sure
that
nobody
on
her
premises
is
a
source
of
a
problem.
