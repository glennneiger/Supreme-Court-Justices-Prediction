justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you...
as
i
understand
the
provision
that
you
object
to,
it...
it
says,
in
effect,
the...
the
tenant
who
signs
the
lease
is
going
to
be
the
guarantor
that
there
will
be
no
drug
activity
in
the
apartment
or
by
other
people
who
are...
are
inhabitants
or
even
people
who
come
to
the
apartment,
going
to
be
a
guarantor.
are
you
saying
that
that
kind
of
a
guarantee
provision
is
simply
forbidden
by
the
constitution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we're...
now,
you're
talking
about
procedural
due
process,
and
there's
no
claim
here,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
tenants
were
denied
procedural
due
process.
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
that
substantive
due
process
forbids
this
kind
of
a
guarantee
provision,
and
when
i
say
why,
i'm
asking
you
why
substantively
does
due
process
forbid.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
no
one
can
be
made
the
guarantor
under
a
contract
for
the
conduct
of
a
third
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--from
the
government.
is
that...
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
your
position?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i...
i
realize
that's
your
position,
but
in
order
to
maintain
that
position
on
a
substantive
due
process
basis,
you've
got
to
say,
i
suppose,
that
there's
no
reasonable
relationship
between
this
kind
of
guarantor
of
conduct
provision
and
the
kind
of
drug
problem
which
i
presume
it
is
conceded
the
government
can
deal
with.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
pretty
obvious
substantial
relationship
between
them
and
that's
why
your
argument
doesn't
seem
to
have
any
sort
of
intuitive
plausibility
to
it.
can
you
address
that?
