whether
it
involves
a
narrower
or
a
broader
slice
really
doesn't
make
any
difference.
it's
just
a
different
kind
of
relationship.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
and
if...
if
you
say
it's
reviewable
by
the
courts,
talk
about
an
unworkable
system.
that
would
be
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
runs
up
against
expressio
unius
too,
doesn't
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--as
a--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--they
can
litigate
that
in
the
unlawful

action.
chief

very
well,
mr.

mr.
lafayette,
we'll

from

chief

william

thank
you,
mr.
lafayette.
mr.
renne,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
doesn't
really
differ
from
the
role
of
any
landlord
in
a
landlord-tenant
situation,
does
it?
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
--absolutely.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
wasn't
the
basis
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
at
all.
perhaps
i'm
mistaken.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
did...
exactly.
where
did
it
come
from
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
put
it
in.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i'm
not
sure
you're
correct
in
your
argument
there,
mr.
renne,
because
perhaps
you...
if
you
had
a
prohibition
against
that
sort
of
a
thing
in
the
statute,
certainly
hud
would
be
bound
by
it.
but
with
no...
no
provision
one
way
or
the
other,
certainly
that's
something
that
hud
is
entitled
to
interpret,
and
it
has
interpreted
it
by
its
regulations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
justice
o'connor
said,
you
never
let
it
get
to
the
eviction
court.
the...
it
wasn't
litigated
as
to
whether
the
lease
should
be
revoked
or
not.
all
that
was
litigated
was
whether
hud
had
a
right
to
put
this
provision
in
its
lease.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
they're
being
treated
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
their
lease.
and
you
ordinarily
can't
come
into
a
court
and
say,
gee,
you
know,
you're
putting
these
tenants
out
on
the
street
if
in
fact
they've
breached
their
lease
in
a
way
that
permits
the
landlord
to
do
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under...
under
your
theory,
you
have
to
show
not
just
that
it
didn't
require
it,
but
that
hud
could
not,
as
an
administrative
agency,
interpret
it
to
allow
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
your
argument...
when...
when
you
have
to
argue
that
point,
the
argument,
as
i
regard
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
is
just
extremely
weak.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
precisely
what
are
those
issues?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you're...
you're
saying
if
you're...
if
you're
evicted
from
a
tenant...
as
a
tenant
from
a
public
housing,
you
are,
a,
punished,
and
b,
you're
found
collectively
guilty?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then...
then
every
eviction
proceeding
in
the
country
punishes
the
tenant.
every
successful
eviction
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
just
going
in
circles,
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--forfeiture
suggests
the
government
coming
in
from
the
outside
and
taking
the
property
because
of
criminal
activity.
here
the
government
isn't
coming
in
from
the
outside.
the
government
is
the
owner
of
the
property.
it
is
the
landlord.
and
so,
you're
not
talking
about
the
same
sort
of
forfeiture
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
renne.
mr.
feldman,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
eviction
proceeding
is
in
the
state
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
the
case
is
submitted.

with
drug
dealers
increasingly
imposing
a
reign
of
terror
on
public
and
other
federally
assisted
law-income
housing
tenants
as
congress
put
it,
congress
passed
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
of
1988.
the
act
states
that
each
public
housing
agency
shall
use
leases
providing
that
any
drug-related
criminal
activity
on
or
off
the
premises
engaged
in
by
a
public
housing
tenant,
any
member
of
the
tenant’s
household,
or
any
guest
or
other
person
under
the
tenant’s
control
shall
be
cause
for
termination
of
tenancy.
the
open-housing
authority
included
this
language
and
its
leases.
in
1997,
1998,
the
housing
authority
instituted
an
eviction
proceedings
against
the
four
respondents
in
this
case
who
are
tenants
alleging
violations
of
the
lease
provision.
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
grandsons
of
the
two
of
the
tenants
were
caught
in
the
apartment
complex
parking
lot
smoking
marijuana.
the
daughter
of
another
tenant
was
found
with
cocaine
three
blocks
from
the
apartment,
and
then
on
three
occasions
the
caretaker
of
still
another
tenant
was
found
with
cocaine
in
his
apartment.
department
regulations
state
that
a
local
public
housing
authority’s
discretion
to
evict
tenants
for
drug-related
activity
includes
those
situations
wherein
which
the
tenant
did
not
know
could
not
foresee
or
could
not
control
behavior
of
other
occupants
of
the
unit.
after
the
eviction
proceedings
were
initiated
in
state
court,
the
tenants
brought
this
action
in
the
federal
court
against
both
hud
and
the
authority,
arguing
that
the
statute
does
not
permit
eviction
when
a
tenant
did
not
know
of
and
had
not
reason
to
know
of
the
drug
activity.
the
district
court
issued
an
injunction
in
joining
the
housing
authority
from
terminating
the
leases
of
tenants.
a
divided
en
banc
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment.
the
statute
unambiguously
requires
lease
terms
that
give
local
public
housing
authorities
the
discretion
to
evict
tenants
for
drug-related
activity
of
household
members
and
guest
regardless
of
whether
the
tenant
know
or
should
have
known
about
the
activity.
the
statute
uses
the
word
any
which
has
an
expansive
meaning.
any
drug-related
activity
engaged
in
by
the
specified
person's
ground
for
termination
not
just
drug-related
activity
that
the
tenant
knew
of.
this
plain
reading
of
the
statute
does
not
lead
to
observe
results
as
the
court
of
appeals
thought.
no-fault
eviction
is
a
common
feature
of
landlord
tenant
law
and
maximizes
deterrence.
it
also
serves
congress’
purpose
of
ridding
public
housing
projects
off
drug
activity,
whether
or
not
a
tenant
has
knowledge
of
the
drug
activity
committed
by
members
of
a
tenant’s
household
or
guest
creates
a
dangerous
environment
for
other
residents.
nor
does
the
statute
raise
significant
constitutional
concerns
as
the
court
of
appeals
thought.
a
housing
authority
is
not
imposing
criminal
or
civil
liability
on
a
tenant
for
the
acts
of
others;
it
is
instead
acting
as
a
landlord
of
property
it
owns
and
invoking
a
least
cost
towards
the
tenant
is
agreed.
there
is
no
indication
that
guarantees
the
procedural
due
process
had
been
denied
in
the
state
proceedings
where
the
eviction
will
eventually
be
decided.
all
members
of
the
court
have
joined
in
this
opinion
except
justice
breyer
who
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
