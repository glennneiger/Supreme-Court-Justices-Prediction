justice
antonin
scalia
for
a
north
carolina
jury
to
sit
in
judgment
of
a
particular
pornographic
transmission
and
decide
whether
this
would
offend
the
standards
of
las
vegas
and
new
york
city?
i
mean,
doesn't
any
jury
necessarily
apply
the
standards
of
its
own
community?
ar-
aren't
we
really
talking
about
an
imaginary
distinction
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
assume
that
you
instruct
the
jury,
jury,
you
must
apply
a
national
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
maybe
congress
wouldn't
mind
even
if
the
child
pornography
industry
flourished,
at
least
drive
it
overseas.
justice
antonin
scalia
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
i
don't
see
why
salon
or
any
other
a-
a-
a-
any
other
commercial
operator
sh-
should
be
immune
by
saying,
well,
i
you
know,
all
of
my
business
isn't
pornography,
just
j-
just
a
little
bit.
justice
antonin
scalia
actually
isn't
it
we're...
justice
antonin
scalia
obscenity
cases,
whether
it
was
obscenity
or
not
depended
upon
the
community
standards.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
is
it
okay
for
obscenity
but
not
okay
here
for
of...
justice
antonin
scalia
not
not
fo-
that
i'm
putting
it
too
t-
too
favorably.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
okay
for
taking
your
chance
on
whether
what
you
publish
is
pornographic
a-
and
and
harmful
to
minors.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean,
we
would
have
to
make
this
exception
even
for
obscenity,
even
for
out-and-out
stuff
that
sows
so
go-
so
far
beyond
that
it's
it's
not
even
just
pornography.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
obscenity.
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever's
the
issue
is
how
unconstitutionally
unfair
it
is
to
the
publisher,
regardless
of
how
many
publishers
ar-
are
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
an
unconstitutional
thing,
y-
you're
going
to
go
to
jail
just
the
same,
whether
you're
going
to
jail
for
pornography
or
obscenity.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
cannot
use
community
standards
for
this,
i
don't
see
why
we
can
use
it
for
obscenity.
justice
antonin
scalia
le-
let's
talk
about
artnet.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
really
think
that
when
artnet
puts
out
the
andre
serano
photographs,
do
you
think
it
expects
to
avoid
being
held
under
this
statute
because
of
six
a
that
it
would
hope
that
the
average
person
applying
contemporary
community
standards
would
find
this
material
as
a
whole
not
designed
to
appeal
to
or
to
pander
to
the
pur-
prurient
interest,
or
do
you
rather
think
that
artnet's
protection
would
surely
be
sought
under
c
namely,
that
the
material
taken
as
a
whole
possesses
serious
literary,
artistic,
political,
or
scientific
value?
isn't
that
their
real
protection?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
one,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
what
would
congress
do,
pass
a...
justice
antonin
scalia
parents
at
their
own
expense
to
impose
user-based
screening?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
a
solution
within
the
power
of
congress.
