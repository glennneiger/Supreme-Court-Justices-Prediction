you
say
relatively.

of
the
first
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
those
words
were
in
the
opinion,
would
you
consider
that
you
had
won
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
think
of
an
example
of
something
that
would
have
serious
literary,
artistic,
political,
or
scientific
value
for
an
adult,
but
it
would
not
have
it
for
a
seventeen-year-old?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
i
looked
at
some
of
the...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
think
seventeen-year-olds
are
pretty
sophisticated,
and
i
don't
understand
why
they
wouldn't
have
salon
magazine,
the
same
kind
of
value
for
a
seventeen-year-old
that
they
have
for
a
twenty-one-year-old.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
even
quite
mature
sixteen-year-olds
who
know
about...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
that's
a...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
case,
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
communities...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
the
particular
issue
is
really
not
the
third
prong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
ask
answer
one
specific
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
how
does
that
affect
the
case,
to
answer
that
question
nationally?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that,
but
is
the
right
thing
to
do,
then,
for
us
to
say,
court
of
appeals,
you
were
wrong
about
the
meaning
of
the
word,
community
standards.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
i
might
be
go
back
to
that,
but
i
didn't
get
an
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking
for
your
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
very
fact
that
your
clients
could
be
prosecuted
does
not
mean
they
win
this
case,
because
after
all,
they
might
be
prosecuted
under
miller,
too,
and
everyone
agrees
that
that's
the
law,
so
i'm
asking
you
for
your
opinion,
if
you
can
find
an
example
of
a
work
of
art
that
would
have
serious
value
for
a
twenty-one-year-old
but
not
for
a
minor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
the
word,
for
example,
for
minors
comes
out
of
cases
that
permit
the
government
to
require
certain
magazines
to
be
placed
in
certain
places
in
the...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
in
the
retail...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
with
brown...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
perhaps
there's
some
experience,
since
we
have
worked
with
the
word
for...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
something
that
has
to
be
done
under
that
law,
but
doesn't
fall
within
miller.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
justice
stevens,
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
capacity
as
a
lawyer,
the
that
whatever
statute
congress
came
up
with,
you
would
believe
in
that
capacity
was
unconstitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
not
prepared
to
say
that
there's
any
statute
that
is
constitutional.
