it
neither
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
defendant
could
call
an
expert
witness
in
your
the
case
in
north
carolina
and
say
that
in
new
york
this
is
fine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
olson.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
true
in
hamling,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
wo-
just
a
minute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
that's
true,
but
you
run
th-
s-
people
in
hamling
ran
the
same
risk.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ha-
hamling
didn't
rely
at
all,
the
opinion
in
hamling,
on
the
fact
that
the
people
could
choose
where
to
where
to
circulate.

mr.
olson,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
is
ashcroft
versus
american
civil
liberties
union,
no.
00-1293.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
congress
passed
the
child
online
protection
act
in
an
attempt
the
restrict
minors
access
to
pornographic
material
on
the
internet.
the
act
prohibits
any
person
from
knowingly
and
with
knowledge
of
the
character
of
the
material
in
interstate
of
foreign
commerce
by
means
of
a
world
wide
web
making
any
communication
for
commercial
purposes
that
is
available
to
any
minor
and
that
includes
any
material
that
is
harmful
to
minors.
in
defining
material
that
is
harmful
to
minors,
the
act
draws
down
the
three-part
test
for
obscenity
set
forth
in
our
decision
in
miller
versus
california
some
30
years
ago,
and
that
requires
jurys
to
apply
contemporary
community
standards
in
assessing
the
material.
the
respondents
who
post
or
have
members
that
post
sexually
oriented
material
on
the
web
brought
a
facial
challenge
before
the
act
went
into
effect
claiming
that
it
violated
the
first
amendment.
the
district
court
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
barring
the
government
from
enforcing
the
act
because
it
thought
the
statute
was
unlikely
to
survive
strict
scrutiny.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
but
based
its
decision
on
the
ground
not
relied
on
by
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
observed
that
because
web
publishers
currently
do
not
have
any
means
of
limiting
access
to
their
sites
based
on
the
geographic
location
of
internet
users,
the
act
would
effectively
force
all
speakers
on
the
web
to
abide
by
the
most
puritan
community
standard.
as
a
result,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
copa
which
is
the
acronym
for
this
law
use
of
contemporary
community
standards
to
identify
material
that
is
harmful
to
minors
rendered
the
statutes
substantially
over
broad.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
thomas
and
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceeding.
we
hold
that
copa’s
reliance
on
community
standards
to
identify
material
that
is
harmful
to
minors
does
not
render
the
statute
facially
unconstitutional.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
which
justice
