olson,
there's
there's
one
thing
that
you
i-
i-
so-
some
new
thing
comes
up
in
your
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
words
that
i
used,
the
the
they
invoke
miller,
so
it
sounds
like
congress
didn't
write
any
word
formula
that
was
any
different,
but
you
do
say
something
it's
not...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
was
the
basis
for
thinking
that
that
that
na-
harmful
to
minors
would
be
reasonably
constant
to
a
greater
extent
than
what
is
obscene?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
context,
if
you
could
i
didn't
get
a
clear
answer
to
my
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
point,
then,
that
we
first
take
out
that
category.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it's
only
when
it
doesn't
have
serious
value,
then
you
get
into
the
question
of
national...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
take
i-
account
in
any
of
this?
i
mean,
one
one
ob-
objection
that's
raised
is,
well
it's
it's
all
futile,
because
you're
just
giving
competitors
from
abroad,
they
will
come
in
and
fill
the
gap
if
us
providers
are
not
available.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
least
from
the
exhibits
that
you
gave
us,
it
doesn't
seem
that
this
material
is
d-
i-
there're
no
virtual
children,
no
n-
no
real
children.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
much
of
it
you
say
and
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
you
this
law
doesn't
touch
i
mean,
y-
i
was
impressed
at
that
set
of
exhibits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the
government's
position
that
of
all
the
exhibits
that
are
at
least
in
in
the
record
presented
to
us,
there's
only
three
that
they
say,
even
as
a
matter
of
law,
might
be
subject
to
prosecution,
so
they're
giving
you
a
clean
bill
of
health
on
all
these
others,
and
they
say
i-
it's
really
a
very
narrow
category,
not
the
broad
category
that
you're
describing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
you
have
to
give
some
effect
to
congress'
words?
it
didn't
say
serious
value,
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
to
say,
well,
congress
you
just
used
those
words,
they
didn't
mean
anything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
it's
you're
saying,
which
was
an
issue
last
time
around,
it
it's
up
to
the
parent,
government
can
do
nothing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
colloquy
with
the
government
on
this
subject,
and
they
were
candid
to
say,
we're
not
trying
simply
to
maximize
parents'
choices.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government's
saying,
we
have
an
independent
interest,
and
we
can
do
something.
