mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
all
three
branches
of
our
national
government
have
repeatedly
determined
that
pornography
causes
substantial,
incalculable
damage
to
our
children,
that
assisting
parents
in
protecting
children
from
that
damage
is
a
compelling
national
interest,
and
that
pornography
is
widely
available
and
readily
accessible
to
our
children
on
the
internet.
the
child
online
protection
act
is
congress'
response
to
that
urgent
national
problem.
it
was
drafted
after
testimony,
hearings,
and
findings
in
direct
response
to
explicit
and
detailed
guidance
in
this
court's
nineteen
ninety-seven
reno
versus
aclu
decision
explaining
how
to
solve
the
problem
of
internet
pornography
in
a
constitutional
manner.
copa
directly
responds
to
several
of
the
court's
explicit
suggestions
in
its
nineteen
ninety-seven
reno
versus
aclu
decision.
in
the
first
place,
congress
gave
explicit,
substantive
meaning
to
the
terms,
harmful
to
minor,
utilizing
standards
developed
over
several
decades
by
this
court
describing
what
would
be
prohibited
in
the
terms
used
by
this
court
in
the
context
of
minors.
i
won't
i
won't
gud
[:
get]
into
the
specifics
of
that,
because
those
are
before
the
court,
and
the
court
is
quite
familiar
with
them.
the
court
the
congress
also
added,
however,
in
response
to
this
court's
explicit
suggestion,
the
third
prong
of
the
so-called
ginsberg-miller
test,
that
the
material
taken
as
a
whole
would
have
to
lack
serious
literary,
artistic,
political,
or
scientific
value
for
minors,
an
objective
standard
developed
by
this
court
to
protect
the
pr-
producers
of
communications.
congress
limited
the
statute
to
commercial
pornographers
at
this
court's
suggestion,
those
whose
trade
or
business,
in
an
effort
to
produce
profits,
are
engaged
regularly
in
the
production
of
explicit
sexual
material
for
profit.
[inaudible]
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
wh-
as
the
reference
to
community
standards
in
the
statute
is
in
the
first
and
second
prongs
of
a
three
part
test.
this
court
has
introduced
that
community
standard
provision
to
protect
the
communicator
from
individualized
determinations
by
jurors,
and
from
particularly
sensitive,
or
or
particularly
insensitive
communities.
the
court
has
explained
again
and
again
that
it's
an
average
standard.
it's
an
adult
approach
to
what
might
be
prohibited
from
the
standpoint
of
damage
to
minors.
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
it
might
be
it
doesn't
n-
refer
to
any
specific
geographic
limitation.
in
fact,
in
the
hamling
case
and
and
in
the
jenkins
case
decided
by
this
court
several
years
ago,
the
court
made
it
clear
that
the
the
community
standards
prong
does
not
have
to
apply
to
any
specific
community.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well
this
court
has
repeately
said
well
in
in
for
example,
in
the
h-
in
the
hamling
case
the
court
was
tal-
looking
at
a
geographic
standard
that
covered
the
entire
state
of
california.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that
well,
yes,
because
the
court
was
at
at
in
that
case
applying
the
two
the
there
other
two
prongs
that
this...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
definition
in
the
statute
itself.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
may
be,
but
what
the
congress
was
attempting
to
do
was
to
develop
and
put
into
the
statute
the
protections
which
this
court
over
the
years
have
said
are
very
important...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
what
this
court
has
decided
is
that
something
that
to
prevent
jurors
from
deciding
imposing
their
own
individual
standards,
or
imposing
the
least
sensitive
standards
o-
o-
of
the
community,
or
the
most
sensitive...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
there's
two
parts
to
that.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that
was
a
a
a
finding,
so
to
speak,
by
the
house
committee
that
there
is
not
with
respect
the
years
have
changed
since
the
the
miller
and
the
hamling
case.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
house
the
house
report
that
specifically
talked
about
that
did
not
explain.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
er
t-
the
the
courts
have
permitted
expert
testimony
with
respect
to
that,
but
there's
a
great
deal
of
supervision
that
the
trial
courts
and
the
appellate
courts
impose
with
respect
to
that
to
make
sure
that
these
definitions
are
being
applied
in...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
thi-
i
i
would
t-
i
would
submit,
justice
kennedy,
that
that
yes,
that
would
be
possible.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
they
want
to
have
it
neither
way.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i'd
i'd
d-
i
think
that
this
court
has
said
that
that
is
not
a
requirement
to
the
first...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
i
would,
justice...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
be
a
a
a
ra-
the
the
the
statute
is
readily
to
use
the
words
of
this
court,
the
statute
is
readily
susceptible
to
the
narrowing
construction,
if
that's
how
you
would
regard
that,
or
a
leveling
construction.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
w-
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well
then,
i
agree
with
your
construction...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
important
point
to
make,
that
the
c-
the
court
has
said
that
that
is
another
way
in
which
we
protect
the
speaker
from
aberrational,
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
sus-
i
suspect,
justice
stevens,
that
the
people
who
assisted
the
members
of
congress
in
drafting
the
statute
read
this
court's
decisions,
as
there's
every
indication
in
the
two
committee
reports
and
in
the
hearings
that
were
taken,
that
the
court
was
attempting
in
every
way
to
live
up
to
the
standards
of
this
court.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
what
i
think
wh-
no,
i
don't
necessarily
think
that
the
court
the
the
congress
was
intending
to
impose
a
national
standard,
because
this
court
had
said
that
it
wasn't
required
under
the
first
amendment,
and
that
the
community
standards
did
not
have
to
be
judged
by
any
particular
geographical
area.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
what
congress
was
attempting
to
do
was
come
as
close
as
possible
to
adopting
what
this
court
had
said
in
the
context
of
obscenity.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
we
yes,
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
would
su-
i
would
submit
that
the
the
the
judge
would
instruct
the
jury,
and
the
judge
examining
the
decision
of
the
jury
afterwards
in
appellate
courts
would
do
exactly
what
this
court
has
said.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
i
i
think
the
defendants
can
put
on
expert
testimony
with
respect
to
what
general
standards
are,
to
use
the
phrase
in
hamling,
country-wide.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i'm
not
objecting
to
that.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that
is
a
reasonable
solution
to
the
problem,
and
is
consistent
with
what
congress
was
saying.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
this
c-
that's
what
this
court
has
said
again
and
again,
and
w-
we
c-
of
course
accept
that,
and
and
that
that
that
is
congress
acc-
accepted
that
as
well.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
that's
right,
and
but
but
remember
that
it
seems
important
to
emphasize
that
these
definitions
are
highly
specific
with
respect
to
the
material
which
is
prohibited.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
congress
did
s-
explicitly
consider
that.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
i
think
that
and
the
court
considered
a
case
earlier
this
year
of
the
damage
that
that
industry
does,
earlier
this
term.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
not
talking
about
that
aspect
of
the
issue
that
you're
considering
in
that
other
case,
but
wha-
but
i
what
i
was
simply
trying
to
address
is
justice
scalia's
question,
that
that
there
this
is
a
this
is
a
major
problem.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
possibly.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
one
of
the
ones
that
we
were
concerned
about
is
a
series
of
very
explicit
pictures,
and
i
think
the
court
knows
which
ones
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
taking
your
chances.
