ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
[inaudible]
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
yeah
justice
scalia,
whether
or
not
we
talk
about
them
as
commercial
pornographers,
the
fact
is,
the
speech
they
communicate,
which
even
the
government
i
don't
think
would
label
them
commercial
pornographers
in
the
sense
that
we
imagine.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
i
think
that...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
think
that
all
of
our
client's
exhibits
are
precisely
that
sort
of
material,
and
that,
of
course...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
there
are
m-
there...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
right.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
i'm...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
perhaps
in
even
most
communities
that
believe
that
providing
any
information
about
experiencing
sexual
pleasure,
about
sex
toys,
to
teenagers,
is
sinful
and
is
definitely
harmful,
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
think
because
all
of
the
millions
of
speakers,
including
our
clients
on
the
web,
they
are
the
ones
that
have
to
understand
this
law,
and
as
mitch
pepper,
who
runs
a
sexual
health
network
which
provides
specific
information
about
how
to
experience
sexual
pleasure
to
disabled
persons,
testified,
i
i
think
very
strongly,
based
on
my
interpretation
of
the
words
in
this
statute,
even
with
the
serious
value
prong,
that
value
prong
is
value
for
minors,
and
he
has
to
believe,
as
he
testified,
that
discussion
of
masturbation,
oral
sex,
anal
sex,
descriptive
positioning,
all
of
that
can
be
construed
as
pandering
to
the
prurient
interest
of
minors.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
for
for
two
reasons
which
i
want
to
explain.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mister
chief
justice,
there's
a
very
real
distinction
here,
and
and
that
is
that
hamling
was
about
the
obscenity
standard.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
because
by
definition
all
of
the
material
targeted
by
the
statute
is
protected
speech
for
adults.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
well,
the
range
of
speech,
however,
of
course,
protected
speech
that
is
limited
by
the
by
any
harmful-to-minors
display
statute.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
again,
most
importantly,
your
honor,
under
any
standard
under
any
standard,
copa
is
unconstitutional...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
deter
such
a
great
amount
of
adults
from...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mhm.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so,
because
we
have
a
very
strong
record
here,
which
again
the
third
circuit
explicitly
affirmed
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court
that
show
that
adults
are
going
to
be
deterred
by
this
law.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
i-
it's
a
your
honor,
it's
a
burden-on-speech
problem.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
yes,
and
as
and
our
answer
is
that
even
under
a
national
standard
this
law
clearly
fi-
violates
the
first
amendment.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
we
again,
i-
if
that
were
the
course
that
you
decided
to
take,
we
do
not
think
that
the
appropriate
thing
would
be
to
vacate
the
injunction,
but
whether
to
leave
the
injunction
in
place,
and
then...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mhm.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
but...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mhm.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
well,
for
one
reason
of
course,
one
of
the
crucial
distinctions
here
is
the
nature
of
the
internet.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mhm.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mhm.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
i
think
that's
a
very
different
conclusion
to
reach
when
you're
talking
about
an
environment
in
which
you
can
control
where
you
send
the
material.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
want
to
communicate
locally,
you
can't.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
we
think
that
that
is
a
very
different
question,
and
and
that
is
not
a
necessary
conclusion
for
the
reason
that
i
said
before
and
that
is
because,
by
definition,
a
national
standard
for
what
is
displayed
as
harmful
to
minors
on
the
web
would
impact
far
more
protected
speech
than
a
national
standard
for
obscenity,
which
is
by
definition
unprotected
for
adults
as
well
as
minors,
and
to
put
it
another
way,
no
adult
has
the
right
to
materials
that
are
obscene
in
even
the
most
tolerant
community.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
have
the
right
to
materials.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mhm.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
we
are
saying...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
we,
of
course,
don't
think
you
need
to
even
reach
that
question
but
to
the
extent
that
you
do,
again,
i
think
that
it
is
quite
a
different
question
because
of
the
amount
of
protected
speech
that
is
impacted.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
i
justice
ginsburg,
in
fact
that
that
concession
in
the
reply
brief
makes
us
more
nervous
than
ever,
and
that
is
because
the
government
has
changed
their
mind.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
in
fact
the
the
the
the
speech
is
indistinguishable
from
many
other
exhibits
that
are
in
the
joint
appendix...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mhm.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
they
really
do
not
believe
it
is
their
protection,
and
that
again
is
because
it
says,
serious
value
for
minors,
and
that,
of
course,
is
one
of
the
primary
distinctions
between
this
category
and
obscenity.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
well,
your
honor,
the
the
government
itself
is
saying
that...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
i-
i-
i
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
but
they're
the
ones
that
are
going
to...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
with
respect,
we
believe
that
all
of
the
exhibits
that
we
have
put
in,
the
artistic
ones
and
the
literary
works,
the
column,
the
the
nude
artworks
by
several
clients,
all
of
these
could
be
targeted
under
the
statute,
and
again,
what
the
effect,
the
first
amendment
effect
of
the
statute
is
whether
or
not
our
clients
legitimately
feel
like
they
have
to
self-censor
under
this
law
as
compared
to
the
obscenity
law.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
yes,
your
honor,
and
and
the
history
of
the
harmful-to-minors
definition,
that
is
one
of
the
primary
points.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
yes,
absolutely.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
we
believe
that
congress
did
two
things
already
that
it
that
we're
not
challenging
here.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mhm.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
and
i
and
i
don't
mean
to
leave
that
impression.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
i
don't
think
that
it
can,
because
again
jurors
are
going
to
have
to
enforce
that.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
community.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
there
isn't
any
way
to
make
it
a
crime
to
display
material
harmful
to
minors
on
the
web.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
that
is
our
position,
and
and
again,
that
we
believe
is
very
consistent
with
with
many
other
statutes
that
have
recently
been
struck
down
by
the
court.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
understand.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mhm.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
there
is
no
way
to
do
it,
and
again,
i
i
do
want
to
be
clear
that
i
i
don't
think
that
we
can
divorce
the
rest
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
even
aside
from
the
deterrence
issues,
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is,
because
the
statute
was
written
so
broadly
as
to
cover
anybody
who
had
even
just
one
image,
for
example,
because
the
statute
was
written
to
include
not
just
images
but
text,
i
think,
you
know,
e-
i
think
those
problems
still
remain
even
just
looking
at
the
textual
language,
even
if
you're
focusing
just
on
the
the
community
standard
versus
the
national
standard,
and
that's
another
reason
why
we
don't
think
that
fixing
that
problem
is
enough
to
save
the
statute.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mhm.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
hm...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mhm
well,
i
mean
i
i
i
i
have
course
don't
want
to
be
the
one
to
rewrite
the
statute
but
i
i
do
think,
as
i...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
i
think
that
a
statute
that
did
just
apply,
for
example,
to
web
sites
who
were
actually
selling
things
already
this
one
isn't
limited
to
that
and
secondly,
web
sites
who
the
predominant
portion
of
their
site
was
actually
harmful
to
minors.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
justice
stevens,
m-
m-
my
my
answer
is
that
i
think
if
they
if
they
wrote
a
statute
are
you
asking
me
whether
i
think
that
would
that
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
also,
because
of
course,
i
have
to
argue
yes,
it
would
be,
but
it
was
certainly
be
you
don't
have
to
bel-
believe
me
on
that.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
that
would
be
a
that's
what
i
mean.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
well,
the
less
restrictive
alternative
for
actually
protecting
children
is
the
user-based
mechanisms,
and
that
again,
the
congress
itself
found
to
be
actually
more
effective
at
protecting
children.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
we
certainly
believe
that
the...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
n-
no
and
we
don't
think
it
needs
to
be,
because
we
think,
of
course,
the
ultimate
decision
ought
to
be
resting
on
parents,
where
it
always
has,
to
make
a...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mhm.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
[inaudible]
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
w-
we
are
not
prepared
to
say
that
any
statute
which
significantly
burdens
adult
speech
is
is
constitutional,
and
i
think
that
is
very
consistent
with
the
opinions
of
this
court,
as
in
the
playboy
case
and
the
denver
area
case.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
the
problem
with
that
would
be,
if
course,
without
some
kind
of
mechanism
that
then
allowed
you
know
parents
to...
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
i
think
that
it
might
have
some
compelled
speech
concerns,
especially,
again,
where
you're
talking
about
a
medium
where
you
have
these
individuals
e-
just
because
it's
commercial
businesses
doesn't
mean
there's
a
big
you
know,
a
lot
of
employees
to
make
these
determinations.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mhm.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
yes,
i
do
believe
that
that
issue
came
up
in
the
playboy
case
last
term,
and
the
court,
you
know,
did
rule
that
again
voluntary
we
can't
assume,
especially
without
a
record
to
the
contrary,
that
parents
are
going
to
fail
to
act.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
thank
you.
