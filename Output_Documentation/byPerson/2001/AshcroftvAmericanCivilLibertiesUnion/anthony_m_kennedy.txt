justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
in
your
view,
is
the
provision
that
it
has
to
be
objectionable
t-
f-
from
the
st-
t-
to
minors,
is
that
a
c-
a
national
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
i
think
it's
it's
i-
it's
a
difficult
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
how
does
it
work?
i
have
a
california
jury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
the
trial
judge
must
instruct
the
jury,
ladies
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
this
is
a
national
standard,
and
that's
consistent
with
what
justice
breyer
suggested
to
you,
that
w-
we
might
consider
in
putting
in
the
opinion,
so
it's
a
national...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
asking
what
the
que-
what
what
the
w-
which
the
congress
wanted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
very
different
than
a
local
bookseller.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
injunction,
vacate
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
say,
you
consider
these
other
these
other
points...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
all
all
this
goes
to
these
other
aspects
of
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
i
understand
where
we
are
in
the
argument,
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
the
court
of
appeals
decided
for
reasons
that
i
i
i
think
we
cannot
criticize
on
this
record
that
it's
going
to
sustain
this
injunc-
injunction
based
on
the
community
p-
standards
problem,
and
we're
asking
you,
if
the
s-
community
standard
is
national,
doesn't
that
solve
that
problem,
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm
coming
away
from
this
argument
w-
with
the
impression
that
you're
saying,
well,
i'm
not
going
to
bother
to
help
you
on
that,
because
there
are
so
many
other
things
in
the
statute
i
want
to
talk
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
doesn't
that
doesn't
help
help
me
answer
this
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
standard
can't
be
enforced
with
any
jury.
