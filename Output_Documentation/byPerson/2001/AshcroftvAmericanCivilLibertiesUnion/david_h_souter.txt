justice
david
h.
souter
but
mis-
mr.
no-
justice
david
h.
souter
olson,
isn't
the
problem
with
that
argument
that
this
that
the
definition
always
also
refers
to
the
average
person,
so
it's
working
average
in
by
a
separate
provision.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
did
it
otherw-
did
that
and
i
just
don't
remember
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
it
have
a
the
average
person
provision
in
the...
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
saying
it's
a
belt
and
suspenders
definition.
justice
david
h.
souter
me
what
the
difference
is
between
the
construction
that
justice
breyer
has
suggested
and
the
result
of
your
argument
that
the
that
the
third
prong,
the
the
value
prong,
is
in
fact
an
objective
prong
and
hence
a
national
stan-
i
t-
assume
it's
a
national
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
necessarily
saying
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
you're
saying
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
[inaudible]
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
mean,
the
what
justice
breyer
is
addressing
and
what
i
was
concerned
with
with
mr.
olson
was
his
argument
that
the
third
prong,
the
value
prong,
in
effect,
sort
of
sands
off
the
rough
edges,
and
and
i-
it
gets
the
in
in
practical
terms
it
gets
the
the
community
peculiarity
out
of
it,
and
and
is
that
i-
obviously
you
don't
agree
with
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
not
here
to
make
a
final
judgment
on
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah
but
that's
not
a
community
standards
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
speech
but
we
did
that
look
at
the
question
we
took.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
you're
and
i
i
i
don't
mean
this
dismissively,
but
i
think
we
have
to
accept
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i'm
i'm
i'm
not
again,
i'm
not
asking
you
the
global...
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
just
asking
you
the
question
that
goes
to
the
specific
issue
that
we
took
for
review,
and
that
is
the
the
legitimacy
of
baiksing
[:
basing]
basing
an
injunction,
or
sustaining
the...
justice
david
h.
souter
court's
injunction...
justice
david
h.
souter
on
the
community
standards
portion
of
the...
justice
david
h.
souter
and
and
all
my
question
to
you
is
simply,
i
take
it
you're
saying
that
there
is
no
way
to
write
a
standard
into
the
statute,
call
it
community,
call
it
national,
call
it
some
third
thing
that
you
dream
up,
that
will
ever
suffice
constitutionally.
