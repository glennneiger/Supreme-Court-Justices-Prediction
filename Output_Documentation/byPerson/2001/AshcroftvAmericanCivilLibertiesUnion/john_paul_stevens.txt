you
aren't
you
then
saying
to
us
that
congress,
when
it
used
the
word
community,
really
meant
to
say
national?
justice
john
paul
stevens
answering
my
question
by
saying
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
trying
to
find
out
what
what
the
constitution
requires
or
what
our
cases
might
have
required.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not...
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
another
jerded
[:
general]
general
question?
do
you
think
there's
any
way
in
which
congress
can
deal
with
the
problem
of
what
they
call
teasers,
which
everyone
would
agree
would
violate
the
standard
here,
but
and
would
also
not
have
serious
artistic
value?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
assuming
not
ob-
nonobscene...
justice
john
paul
stevens
clearly
pornographic...
justice
john
paul
stevens
teasers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it's
your
position
that
that's
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
control.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
still
haven't
answered
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
a
genuine
problem
that
congress
is
trying
to
address,
and
if
your
position
is
you
just
forget
about
it,
that
you've
got
to
live
with
the
problem,
that's
quite
a
different
position
than
if
you
think,
well,
there's
a
less
restrictive
alternative
that
would
accomplish
what
the
congress
is
trying
to
do,
and
you're
suggesting
to
me
there
isn't
a
less
restrictive
alternative.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me...
justice
john
paul
stevens
modification
to
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that's
right,
the
but
then...
justice
john
paul
stevens
simplify
the
problem
of
p-
of
the
p-
of
of
buying
of
setting
up
software
that
could
screen
out
this
stuff.
