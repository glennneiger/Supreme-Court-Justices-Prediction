justice
john
paul
stevens
may
may
i
ask
this
question?
at
the
very
page
of
the
opinion
that
you
call
our
attention
to,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
in
reaching
our
conclusion,
we
find
that
some
of
the
factors
on
which
the
district
court
relied
are
neither
relevant
nor
appropriate
to
a
reasonable
suspicious
suspicion
analysis
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
saying
that
in
this
case
it
had
no
relevance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
i
get
the
impression,
in
reading
the
officer's
testimony,
what
he
really
did
is
once
he
checked
and
found
where
the
car
came
from,
where
it
was
registered
in
a
high
drug
area,
that's
what
triggered
his
decision
to
stop
the
vehicle.
justice
john
paul
stevens
things
like
waving
and
slowing
down
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
part
of
the
location,
as
i
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you're
saying
what
you're
saying
i
think
is
that
even
if
the
ninth
circuit
were
correct
in
disregarding
the
waving
and
the
slowing
down
and
the
failure
to
wave
once,
you'd
still
have
probabl-
a
s-
a
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
a
que-
another
question,
if
you
if
you
if
you
have
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
what
the
at
the
setup
here,
why
there's
the
checkpoint
thirty
miles
from
the
border,
and
whether
or
not
there
was
one
closer
to
the
border.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
the
other
question
i
had
is
about
the
sensors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
only
the
northbound,
but
also
the
fact
that
he
turned
right
the
first
time
er
le-
with
fa-
on
the
left
the
first
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
comment
on
on
a
phase
of
the
case
that
keeps
com-
puzzling
me?
the
the
sensors
on
the
road.
justice
john
paul
stevens
suspicious
if
there
is
a
much
more
of
a
rapid
route
available,
rapid
and
comfortable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
only
an
isolated
area,
but
the
testimony
was
that
the
people
who
normally
used
the
road
were
locals,
ranchers
or
others,
that
it
was
not
a
road
frequently
traveled
by
families.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
suggests
that
every
time
somebody
trips
the
sensor,
they
go
out
and
take
a
look
at
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
significance
of
the
shift
change?
i
frankly
didn't
quite
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
difference
would
it
make?
does
that
make?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
still
don't
understand
because
that
would
be
at
the
moment
of
the
change.
justice
john
paul
stevens
really
puzzled...
justice
john
paul
stevens
tell
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he'd
be
be
driving
back,
but
at
the
same
time
the
sensors
are
working.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
record
tell
us
whether
it
was
generally
known
that
there
were
sensors
on
this
road?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
had
the
feeling
it
might
be
a
different
case
if
they
just
put
a
sign
up
saying,
strangers
in
this
area
are
subject
to
stop
if
they're
not
you
know,
if
they're
not
local
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
of
the
sensors
you
think.
