mr.
austin
c.
schlick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
since
terry,
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
requires
a
common
sense
evaluation
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
the
decision
below
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
that
rule
because
it
requires
law
enforcement
officers
to
disregard
potentially
relevant
facts
when
determining
whether
investigative
stop
is
warranted.
this
court's
decisions
in
cortez
and
sokolow
are
especially
clear
in
rejecting
attempts
to
put
categories
of
facts
off
limits.
in
cortez,
the
court
held
that
a
vehicle's
route,
the
timing
of
its
trip,
and
its
capacity
for
carrying
carrying
illegal
aliens
together
established
reasonable
suspicion,
notwithstanding
that
each
of
those
facts
independently
might
be
consistent
with
innocent
travel.
in
sokolow,
the
court
rejected
a
rule
that
would
have
limited
officers'
ability
to
consider
the
personal
characteristics
of
suspected
drug
smugglers.
the
court
held
that
that
sort
of
rule
adds
to
the
difficulty
of
applying
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
it
does
not
ease
it.
and
the
court
further
confirmed
that
innocent
facts,
facts
consistent
with
innocent
travel,
in
themselves
may
together
establish
reasonable
suspicion.
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
attempted
to
establish
a
rule
that
would
bar
categorically
consideration
of
certain
facts
that
the
court
deemed
innocent.
that
that
rule
presents
two
fundamental
problems.
the
first
is
that
it
doesn't
accommodate
the
subtleties
of
real
world
encounters.
for
every
categorical
rule,
there
would
have
to
be
exceptions
and
subrules,
and
even
if
law
enforcement
officers
could
be
asked
to
master
those,
they
would
still
then
have
to
anticipate
new
situations,
and
those
rules
could
not
provide
guidance
when...
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
the
problem,
justice
ginsburg,
was
that
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
admit
of
situations
in
which
deceleration
might
be
relevant.
for
example,
in
the
fifth
circuit's
villalobos
case,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
the
law
enforcement
officer
pulled
in
front
of
the
vehicle
that
was
suspected.
the
vehicle
then
slowed
to
drop
back
away
from
the
law
enforcement
vehicle,
and
the
border
patrol
officer
in
that
case
deemed
that
suspicious,
that
it
appeared
the
vehicle
had
changed
its
speed
in
order
to
increase
its
distance
from
the
law...
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
justice
ginsburg,
we
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
attempting
to
establish
categorical
rules.
on
page
twelve
a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
court
says,
we
attempt
here
to
describe
and
clearly
delimit
the
extent
to
which
certain
factors
may
be
considered
by
law
enforcement
officers
in
making
su-
in
stops
such
as
the
stop
here.
on
the
same
page,
slowing
down
after
spotting
a
law
enforcement
vehicle
is
an
entirely
normal
response
that
is
in
no
way
indicative
of
criminal
activity.
that
that
appears
not
to
have
made
a
possibil-
of
the
possibility
that
deceleration
may
in
some
context
be
suspicious.
and
indeed,
in
the
ninth
circuit's
sigmond-ballesteros
case,
decided
after
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
interpreted
its
decision
in
this
case
as
holding
that
only
certain
factors
may
be
considered
by
law
enforcement
officers
when
making
stops.
and
it's
it's
that
categorical
rule
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test.
[inaudible]
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
no,
it
d-
it
ordinarily
would
not.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
it
it
may
depend
on
the
particular
area,
and
that's
that
may
be
a
question
on
which
you
would
look
to
the
law
enforcement
officer's
experience
and
expertise.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
i
i
think
your
intuition
accords
wi-
with
common
experience
and
the
holdings
of
most
courts.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
justice
ginsburg,
on
page
fifty
seven
of
the
joint
appendix,
agent
stoddard
testified
that
the
extreme
deceleration
in
this
case,
from
about
fifty
to
fifty
five
miles
per
hour
down
to
about
twenty
five
or
thirty
miles
per
hour,
was
not
normal
and
did
set
respondent's
vehicle
apart
from
ordinary
traffic
on
those
roads.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
uh
between
twenty
five
miles
per
hour
and
thirty
five
miles
per
hour,
your
honor.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
i
i
i
don't
know
for
sure.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that...
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
again,
agent
stoddard
testified
that
that
sort
of
deceleration,
that
speed,
was
not
common
in
the
area,
and
it...
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
i'm
sorry.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that
that's
right,
and
then
head
up
to
i
ten,
which
would
allow
him
to
go
to
tucson
tucson
or
phoenix,
for
example.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
the
district
court
addressed
that
possibility
on
page
twenty
two
a
of
the
petition
appendix
and
said
that
that
would
require
a
forty
or
fifty
mile
trip
over
unimproved
dirt
roads.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
the
deceleration
is
is
not
a
factor
on
which
the
case
would
turn.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
justice
stevens,
we
would
say
that
it
had
some
relevance.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
er
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
agent
stoddard's
testimony
was
that
both
respondent
and
his
front-seat
adult
passenger
stared
straight
ahead.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
again,
agent
stoddard's
testimony
was
was
that
respondent's
behavior
wa-
it
was
very
unusual.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
the
testimony,
mr.
chief
jus-
mr.
chief
justice,
was
that
this
road
the
sensor
hits
on
the
border
patrol
maintains
sensors
along
leslie
canyon
road
and
rucker
canyon
road,
and
that
the
first
sensor
on
leslie
canyon
road,
which
responded
to
northbound
traffic,
was
triggered
about
once
every
two
hours.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
correct.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
twelve,
ten
and
seven.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
er
they
weren't
simply
waving,
your
honor.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
correct.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
correct.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
ornelas,
among
other
cases,
addressed
that,
your
honor,
and
and
held
that
it's
appropriate
to
give
due
weight
to
the
expertise
and
experience
of
law
enforcement
officers
and
local
judges.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
if
you...
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
as
as
i
understand
your
question,
no,
i
don't
think
they
would
be.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
is
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
stevens,
is
the
fact
that
it
was
a
minivan?
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes,
yes.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
there
is
a
border
inspection
station
in
in
douglas,
but
the
court
explained
in
martinez-fuerte
the
th-
the
the
criteria
the
border
patrol
uses
to
establish
its
fixed
checkpoints,
and
i
think
those
criteria
continue
to
hold
true
today.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
the
sensors
are
magnetic
sensors
which
are
directional.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
right.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
certainly,
justice
stevens.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
on
i
one
ninety
one.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
true.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
the
record
does
not.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
certainly,
justice
stevens,
the
smugglers
are
well
aware
of
the
location
of
the
checkpoint
and
the
route
to
to
evade
it.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
i
i
i
i
can't
answer
that
question.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
the
record
does
include
evidence
that
the
recreation
areas
off
of
rucker
canyon
road
if...
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
no,
justice
breyer.
