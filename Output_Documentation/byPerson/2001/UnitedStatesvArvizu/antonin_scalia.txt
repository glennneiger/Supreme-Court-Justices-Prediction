justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
it
would
be
suspicious
if
i-
if
you're
on
a
highway
that
has
not
only
a
maximum
speed
but
a
minimum
speed,
and
and
the
car
slows
down
twenty
miles
below
the
minimum
when
it
when
it
sees
a
police
officer.
that
that
wouldn't
be
a
normal
reaction,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
d-
and
do
you
think
it's
a
normal
reaction
always
to
slow
down
when
one
sees
a
police
a
police
car
even
if
you
happen
to
be
going
ten
miles
below
the
speed
limit
already?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
do
it.
maybe
you
do
it.
but
if
i'm
ten
miles
under
the
speed
limit
already,
i
i
don't
immediately
slow
down
when
i
see
a
police
car.
i
i
don't
know
why
you
are
willing
to
accept
that
as
a
as
an
image
of
reality
that
everybody
slows
down
when
you
see
a
police
car.
if
you're
if
you're
going
over
the
speed
limit,
i
assume
you
do.
[inaudible]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
speed
limit
on
the
roads?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
what
was
the
portion
where
where
he
slowed
down?
i
mean,
it
was
twenty
five
to
thirty
five?
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
sounds
a
lot
more
reasonable
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
zipping
along
at
fifty
despite
seeing
a
police
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
schlick,
could
i
come
back
to
the
to
the
slowing
slowing
up?
u-
a-
i'm
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
the
what
the
government's
objection
to
the
court's
opinion
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
factor,
y-
your
your
really
your
only
objection
is
you
can't
be
as
categorical
as
the
court
of
appeals
put
the
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
about
what
about,
you
know,
not
not
waving
to
the
police
car
as
you
go
by?
i
don't
know
when
i
if
i
were
ever
exceeding
the
speed
limit
and
saw
and
saw
a
police
car,
it
seems
to
me
i
would
slow
down
and
and
try
to
give
the
impression
that
i
wasn't
slowing
down
because
i
saw
the
police
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
maybe
somebody
who
had
been
going
fifty
miles
an
hour
in
a
twenty
five
mile-an-hour
zone.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
waving
forward.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
and
the
car
the
police
c-
the
border
patrol
car
was
behind
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
maybe
we
really
don't
know
enough
to
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
said,
people,
when
they
see
my
border
patrol
car,
normally
don't
slow
down.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
whether
border
patrol
agents
give
speeding
tickets?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
open
question
whether
they
give
speeding
tickets?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
they
have
other
things
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
i
i'd
feel
much
more
sympathetic
to
to
that
person
th-
th-
than
tha-
than
i
would
to
your
client
who
who
whose
whose
argument
essentially
is,
yes,
i
was
indeed
a
smuggler,
but
an-
and
he
suspected
me
to
be
a
smuggler
and
he
turned
out
to
be
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
saying
it's
conclusive.
