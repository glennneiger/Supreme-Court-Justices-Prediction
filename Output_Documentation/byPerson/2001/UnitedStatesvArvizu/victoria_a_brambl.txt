ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
i
wanted
to
respond
to
the
question
that
you
asked,
mr.
chief
justice,
about
who
should
we
give
due
weight
to
and
who
is
going
to
know
better,
the
officer
in
the
field,
the
district
court,
or
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
i
think
that
all
the
parties
agree
that
the
totality
cannot
have
categorical
rules
because...
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
i
think
that
some
of
the
language
that
the
ninth
circuit
used
was
inartful
in
that
it
made
it
sound
if
you
take
one
sentence
out
of
the
whole
opinion,
it
would
make
it
sound
like
they
were
creating
categorical
rules.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
i
certainly
agree
that
that
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
where
you
live
or
slowing
down
could
be.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
the
agent
like
so
many
of
the
factors
in
this
case,
the
agent
didn't
really
tie
down
or
tie
into
his
experience
why
slowing
down
would
be
predictive
or
indicative
of
not
just
speeding
but
of
criminal
activity
such
as
alien
or
drug
smuggling,
which
was
the
reason
that
he
was
out
there.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well...
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
i
think
that
that's
an
open
question.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
but
i
believe
that
they
generally...
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
they
do
have
other
things
to
do.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
the
district
court
judge
did
refer
to
that,
but
what's
what
the
the
court
of
appeals
picked
up
on,
which
the
district
court
didn't,
was
all
of
the
inferences
that
and
subjective
beliefs
that
this
waving
entailed
because
it
wasn't
just
the
the
children
were
facing
forward
and
waving
forward.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
i
think
that
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
issue
presented
by
this
case,
which
is
what
can
the
court
of
appeals
exclude
as
factors,
even
if
they
do
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
i
certainly
agree
that
totality
a-
and
reasonableness
has
to
remain
flexible,
and
that
given
the
times
that
we
live
in,
that
perhaps
adjustments
are
going
to
be
made.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
it
is
but
there's
a
surprising
repetition
of
factors.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well
well,
even
this
court
in
ornelas
recognized
that
certain
fact
patterns
were
similar,
such
as
sokolow
and
royer
and
a
few
others,
that
really
given
how
fact-specific
they
are,
there
really
is,
especially
when
you
start
looking
in
border
areas
where
for
instance,
there
are
a
number
of
stops
where
there
are
checkpoints
and
and
people
claiming
that
perhaps
these
people
are
on
the
road
for
checkpoint
evasion...
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
sure.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well
,
the
ninth
circuit,
even
since
this
opinion,
still
examines
all
of
the
factors.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
i
think
that
the
solution
is
to
allow
courts
like
the
ninth
circuit
and
other
circuits
to
say,
look,
we
see
the
same
thing
time
and
time
again,
and
it
really
has
very
little
or
no
meaning.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
as
as
i
said,
the
the
language
the
ninth
circuit
used
could
have
been
a
lot
more
clear
and
a
lot
more
artful.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
they
did
say
frequently,
and
in
effect,
when
there
was
a
rehearing
in
this
case,
they
amended
the
opinion
to
add
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
in
this
case
on
many,
many
times.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
it
would
have
helped.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
and
i
think
you're
right.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
that's
true,
but
the
ninth
circuit
did
point
out
and
if
you
look
at
the
map
that's
on
page
one
fifty
seven
of
the
joint
appendix
that's
the
map
that
we
submitted
in
connection
with
this
case
and
that
the
district
court
and
the
the
ninth
circuit
considered
it
shows
that
it's
got
a
lot
more
detail,
as
far
as
a
lot
of
the
destinations.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
yes.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
once
you
turn
onto
that
road
and
you
keep
going,
you
can
see
on
to
the
east
there's
a
number
of
campgrounds,
a
number
of
areas,
including...
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
yes.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
the
van
was
appropriate
for
that
road
and
the
conditions,
and
i
would
point
out
that
when
the
agent
had...
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
sure,
but...
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
it
might
be
a
a
matter
of
preference
and
and
and
taste.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
but
it
isn't
suspicious
for
a
family
from
douglas
to
use
a
road
that
leads
right
from
douglas,
that
start
out
that
starts
out
ten
miles
paved,
to
go
through
a
beautiful
area
up
to
perhaps
chiricahua
monument
or
some
of
the
areas
along
there
on
the...
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
that's
correct.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well
well,
it
really
doesn't
because
we
know
that
he
was
involved
in
illegal
activity,
but
that's
the
hindsight
of
what
the
officer
found
after
the
stop.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well
well,
i
think
what's
important
to
recognize
is
when
you
look
at
the
maps,
there
aren't
too
many
roads
that
lead
anywhere
from
douglas
because
it's
right
on
the
border.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
they
were
going
fifty
to
fifty-five...
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
and
there
was
no
testimony
that
the
car
was
flying
the
van
was
flying
all
over
the
place,
whi-
which
tells
me
and
the
pictures
bear
it
out
is
that
this
wasn't
it
was
a
dirt
road
and
it
was
in
a
a
fairly
isolated
area,
not
full
of
houses
and
and
whatnot.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
however,
the
testim-
that
was
the
testimony
by
the
border
patrol...
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
the
investigator
from
our
office
testified
that
this
road
was
used
and
enjoyed
by
all
kinds
of
families.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
that's
true.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
and
it
would
be
a
shame
if
if
every
family
on
a
road
like
that
or
on
that
road
in
a
minivan
on
a
holiday
would
be
subject
to
heightened
scrutiny
just
because
this
happens
to
be
a
road
where
smugglers
sometimes
use
it.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
[inaudible]
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
w-
well,
one
of
the
problems
with
with
fourth
amendment
issues
is
that
the
vast
majority
of
innocent
people
that
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
often
remain
silent
when
they
are
subjected
to
arbitrary
or
or
random
stops.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
it
doesn't.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
the
problem
is
there
weren't
really
any
factors
or...
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
that's
exactly
right.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
it's
certainly
forty
five
minutes
before
a
sh-
shift
change
when
perhaps,
depending
on
where
the
agents
are
out
in
the
field,
some
of
them
may
be
returning
back.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
the
border
patrol
claims
that
smugglers,
in
general,
are
aware
of
when
they
change...
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
the
thought
is
that
smugglers
would
then
think
they're
getting
by
because
all
of
the
agents
are
at
the
s-
at
the
station.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
th-
that's
exactly
right.
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
well,
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
a-
and
that's
the
point
we
were
able
to
make
in
the
the
record
that
the
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed,
which
is
that
when
exactly
when
shift
change
would
occur
and
when
the...
ms.
victoria
a.
brambl
thank
you.
