chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
oh
oh
one
five
one
nine,
united
states
against
ralph
arvizu.
mr.
schlick.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
an
established
speed
limit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
arizona.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
turned
left
rather
than
right,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
idea
that
he
would
eventually
go
north
on
kuykendall
and
then
take
go
west
to
rejoin
one
ninety
one
north
of
the
checkpoint.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
testimony
as
to
the
amount
of
use
this
particular
route
got?
how
how
many
cars
a
da-
a
day,
anything
about
how
many
cars
a
day
or
an
hour
came
over
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
car
every
two
hours?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
to
what
extent,
mr.
schlick,
do
three
judges,
say,
sitting
in
san
francisco
or
los
angeles
or
nine
justices
sitting
here
do
we
defer
to
the
judgment
in
these
matters
of
a
border
patrol
agent
on
the
scene?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
schlick.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
those
that
type
of
opinion
seems
to
me
contrary
to
our
opinion
in
sokolow
where
we
said
you
just
can't
categorize
these
kind
of
factors
and
say
that
v-
this
kind
of
thing
is
never
useful
and
something
else
is
always
useful.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
then
certainly
you
you
must
you're
not
defending
then
some
parts
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
when
when
we
have
said
that
the
test
is
totality
of
the
circumstances,
the
amount
of
guidance
that
can
be
provided
by
by
a
court
is
is
somewhat
limited.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
surprising
repetition
of
factors
by
the
ninth
circuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know,
checkpoints
vary
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
chiricahua?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
f-
to
go
from
douglas
to
chiricahua
national
monument
would
be
er
would
be
extremely
odd
to
go
the
route
this
minivan
took.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it's
appropriate,
if
it's
i-
it's
also
appropriate
to
go
on
a
paved
highway,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
why
why
would
you
go
up
this
very
winding
road
to
a
place
that
you
can
get
to
much
more
quickly
by
going
up
a
paved
highway?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah
ye-
bu-
s-
you
know,
all
of
these
factors
as
as
justice
breyer
sugge-
we're
not
saying
that
they
would
prove
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
that
they
would
amount
to
probable
cause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah
you
you
you
can't
s-
i-
it's
obviously
nothing
crimin-
but
wh-
wh-
what
do
what
did
the
respondent
say,
that
he
was
going
to
meet
somebody
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wh-
wh-
what's
how
does
that
tie
in
with
going
to
a
re-
recreational
area?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ju-
just
before
the
shift
change
is
an
individualized
factor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
i-
we're
not
saying
that
i-
a-
anytime
someone
comes
along
this
road
it's
suspicious.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you,
ms.
brambl.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schlick,
you
have
five
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schlick.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
00-1519,
united
states
versus
arvizu.
on
a
january
afternoon
four
years
ago,
border
patrol
agent
clinton
stoddard
was
working
on
a
checkpoint
along
us
highway
191
about
30
miles
north
of
douglas,
arizona
which
lies
on
the
united
states
mexico
border.
at
the
checkpoint,
border
patrol
agents
stop
cars
to
look
for
illegal
immigration
and
smuggling.
smugglers
try
to
avoid
the
checkpoint
by
taking
unpaved
and
primitive
back
roads
around
them.
stoddard
received
a
report
that
a
sensor
placed
along
the
back
road
had
been
triggered
indicating
that
a
vehicle
might
be
following
a
common
smuggling
route
through
a
thinly
populated
area
between
the
highway
and
a
national
forest.
he
drove
to
investigate
and
saw
respondent's
mini
van.
it
slowed
dramatically.
the
respondent
who
was
driving
appeared
stiff
and
nervous.
three
children
were
inside.
the
position
of
the
children’s
feet
in
the
back
seat
suggested
cargo
on
the
floor.
stoddard
followed
the
mini
van
and
learned
that
it
was
registered
to
a
douglas
neighborhood
notorious
for
smuggling.
after
the
mini
van
turned
away
from
known
recreational
areas
and
took
the
last
turn
to
avoid
the
checkpoints,
stoddard
decided
to
stop
it.
a
vehicle
search
uncovered
128
pounds
of
marijuana,
some
of
it
concealed
on
a
duffel
bag
beneath
the
children’s
feet.
respondent
was
charged
with
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
marijuana,
he
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
of
the
drugs
arguing
that
the
stop
was
not
supported
by
any
reasonable
suspicion
as
required
by
the
fourth
amendment.
the
district
court
ruled
against
him
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
and
in
opinion
followed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
in
its
opinion
the
court
of
appeals
set
out
to
clearly
delimit
the
factors
an
officers
can
consider
in
making
stops
like
the
one
involved
here.
it
held
at
seven
factors
including
respondents
slowing
down
were
simply
out
of
bounds
in
deciding
whether
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
and
that
the
remaining
factors
do
not
satisfy
the
fourth
amendment.
this
methodology
is
totally
contrary
to
our
prior
decisions.
in
cases
such
as
cortez
versus
united
states
we
have
siad
that
the
reviewing
court
should
make
reasonable
suspicion
determination
by
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
of
each
case
to
see
whether
the
detaining
officer
has
a
particularized
and
objective
basis
for
suspecting
legal
wrongdoing.
this
standard
allows
officers
to
draw
on
their
own
experience
and
training
to
make
inferences
from
the
cumulative
information
before
them.
it
is
irreducible
to
a
neat
set
of
rules.
in
united
states
versus
sokolow
we
rejected
a
holding
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
sought
to
distinguish
between
incriminating
evidence
and
other
types
of
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
approach
in
this
case
fairs
no
better
it
would
seriously
undercut
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
principle
that
governs
reasonable
suspicion
determination.
facts
that
maybe
unremarkable
on
one
context,
maybe
quite
relevant
in
another,
analyzed
under
the
proper
standard
to
stop
was
constitutionally
permissible.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
