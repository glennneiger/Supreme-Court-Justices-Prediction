think
your
your
point
is
is
well
taken
as
far
as
you
go,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
not
going
to
help
the
ninth

opinion
here
because
what
you're
saying
is
don't
rely
on
highly
general
factors
which
are
so
general
that
we
really,
in
the
abstract,
don't
know
where
they
point.

well,
it
might
have
said
what
you
said,
but
it
didn't
say
what
you
said.
