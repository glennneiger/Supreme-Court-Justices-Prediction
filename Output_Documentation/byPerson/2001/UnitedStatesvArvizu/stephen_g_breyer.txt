justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
quite
disturbed
actually
by
the
opinion
because
i
thought
there
were
five
or
six
supreme
court
cases
that
say
this
is
just
the
kind
of
opinion
you
should
not
write.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
know
from
the
record
what
kind
of
wave
it
was?
what
what
he
says
in
his
testimony
is
they
kind
of
stuck
their
hands
up
and
began
waving
to
me
like
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
a
a
point
that's
a
serious
point
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
about
that?
i
had
thought
that
the
way
to
deal
with
it
is
totality
of
the
circumstances
is
the
way
to
deal
with
it,
not
having
rigid
rules
that
say
you
can
never
consider
whether
his
he
was
sweating
or
wasn't
sweating.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
any
indication
there
ever
has
been
such
a
family?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
imagine
if
there
were
an
innocent
family
happened
to
accidentally
come
from
an
area
where
there
is
a
lot
of
smuggling,
and
that
doesn't
you
know,
not
everybody
is
a
smuggler
in
such
an
area.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a-
are
there
any
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
suggests
at
all,
or
i-
anywhere,
that
there
are
other
fam-
there
are
families,
that
sometimes
people
do
use
this
for
picnics?
they
like
sightseeing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
of
them,
but
there's
one
further
to
the
north.
