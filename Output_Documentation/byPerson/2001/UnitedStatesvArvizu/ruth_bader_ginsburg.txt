mr.
schlick,
you
said
we'd-
this
is
an
area
in
which
one
can
use
one's
common
sense,
and
i
thought
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
telling
us
was
that
some
items
in
that
list
under
all
circumstances
wouldn't
cast
suspicion.
and
one
was
cert-
had
a
certain
familiar
ring
with
me
that
when
you
see
a
police
car,
you
slow
down.
this
wasn't
a
car
that
came
to
a
screeching
halt
or
was
trying
to
dodge
it,
and
then
it
just
slowed
down.
and
isn't
that
a
most
natural
reaction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
weren-
weren't
talking
about
that
case.
they
were
talking
about
this
case.
and
i
thought
what
they
were
saying
was
that
there
was
nothing
suspicious
about
the
slowdown
here,
and
if
that's
all
that
you
have,
s-
it
it
won't
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
there
was
a
concrete
record
here
of
what
this
driver
was
doing,
and
he
wasn't
going
ten
miles
an
hour.
he
was
going
a
a
normal
speed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
what
he
slowed
down...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to...
that
was...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
what
he
slowed
down
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
things
the
ninth
circuit
said
is
just
looking
at
this
laundry
list
and
just
to
throw
everything
in
and
mix
it
all
up
and
say
it's
suspicious
that
the
driver
didn't
look
at
the
police
officer
or
didn't
wave,
but
it's
equally
suspicious
that
the
children
did
wave.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
children
were
waving
in
the
back,
and
something
was
to
be
inferred
from
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
brambl,
the
the
district
court
ruled
for
the
government
in
this
case,
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
often
enough.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
initially
the
opinion
did
read
categorically
we
don't
consider
slowing
down,
we
don't
consider
kids
waving,
and
then
they
threw
in
a
lot
of
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
not
in
in
every
instance,
but
in
a
number
of
cases
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
one
thing
that
the
circuit
didn't
do
and
it
it
did
puzzle
me
was
when
i
read
the
district
court's
opinion,
i
thought
the
district
court
was
saying,
yeah,
i
could
go
along
with
they're
in
a
recreation
area.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
know
one
know
about
the
stops
of
of
someone
who
is
a
perfectly
law-abiding
citizen?
nobody
is
pressing
charges
against
them.
