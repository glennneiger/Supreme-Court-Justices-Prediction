chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mister
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sixth
circuit
below
held
that
the
respondent,
ms.
williams,
was
substantially
limited
in
performing
manual
tasks
and
therefore
disabled
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
because
she
could
not
perform
the
manual
tasks
associated
with
her
assembly
line
job,
specifically
gripping
a
sponge
and
repetitively
wiping
down
cars
with
her
arms
at
shoulder
level
for
an
extended
period
of
time.
that
test
for
disability
status
was
wrong.
it
was
wrong
because
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute
which
requires
a
substantial
limitation
on
a
major
life
activity.
repetitively
wiping
down
cars
with
arms
at
shoulder
level
for
an
extended
period
of
time
is
not
a
major
life
activity,
and
being
limited
in
that
activity
does
not
constitute
being
substantially
limited
in
the
major
life
activity
of
performing
manual
tasks
in
general.
a
plaintiff
must
show
a
substantial
limitation
in
a
broad
range
of
manual
tasks
to
meet
the
statutory
standard.
the
most
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
extrapolate
was
that
ms.
williams
was
substantially
limited
in
the
tasks
associated
with
jobs
that
required
gripping
tools
and
repetitive
activity
with
arms
at
shoulder
level
for
an
extended
period
of
time.
that
is
a
specialized
and
idiosyncratic
limitation.
it
is
not
a
substantial...
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
limitation...
mr.
roberts,
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
a
number
of
things
about
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
the
district
court
considered
it
and
said
it
was
not
probative
of
what
it
purported
to
show,
a
loss
of
access
to
the
job
market.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
b-
but
but
pursuant
to
very
different
standards.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
first
of
all,
it
may
be
pertinent
if
the
standards
were
the
same,
but
only
under
the
working
category.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
a
couple
of
reasons.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
the
more
typical
approach
would
be
not
to
address
the
major
life
activity
of
working
since
it
was
not
addressed
below,
except
to
this
extent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
c-
certainly
with
respect
to
manual
tasks,
you
have
to
look
at
both
because
it's
not
enough,
obviously,
to
say
there's
one
particular
manual
task
that
i
can't
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
a
very
important
sentence
that
i
think
has
to
be
read
carefully.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well...
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
first,
because
that
type
of
an
inference
is
contradicted
by
the
record.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
working,
it
is
important
i
think
to
identify
what
major
life
activity
you're
talking
about
because
as
the
eeoc
has
recognized
in
its
regulations,
as
this
court
has
indicated,
there
are
all
sorts
of
problems
when
you
say
working
is
a
major
life
activity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
yes,
you
can,
and
i
and
certainly
in
a
manual
tasks
case,
you
can
submit
evidence
and
say,
here's
an
example
of
manual
tasks
that
i
can't
perform,
the
ones
that
are
required
at
work.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
i'm
limited
in
manual
tasks,
you
do
have
to
look,
and
this
is
what
all
the
other
courts
of
appeals
have
done,
the
broad
range
of
manual
tasks.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
wrong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
job
is
enough
for
us.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
if
if
they're
going
to
look
at
it
under
manual
tasks,
you've
got
to
look
at
all
manual
tasks.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you're
going
to
look
at
it
under
working,
you've
got
to
look
at
either
a
class
or
a
broad
range
of
jobs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
jobs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
still
need
to
know
what
about
everyday
activities.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
evidence
then
would
probably
not
be
that
she
can
take
care
of
herself
generally.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the-
then
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
properly
analyzed
as
a
working
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
certainly
reverse
with
respect
to
the
summary
judgment
on
performing
manual
tasks.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
unless
the
court
felt,
given
the
fact
that
the
issues
with
respect
to
working
were
insinuated
into
the
case
by
the
sixth
circuit's
approach,
that
it
was
appropriate
to
address
that
major
life
activity
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
