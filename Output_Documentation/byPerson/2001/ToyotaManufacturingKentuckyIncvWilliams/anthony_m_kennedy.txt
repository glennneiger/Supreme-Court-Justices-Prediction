un-
under
the

harbor
workers
and
compensation
act
,
we
ru-
the
courts
routinely
look
at
what
jobs
are
in
the
community
that
this

is
eligible
for
after
they've
suffered
an

well,
do
you
think
a
f-
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
of
in
the
c-
at
the
end
of

carryover
paragraph
at
four

it
says,
it
would
appear,
nevertheless,
from
the
language
of
the
act,
the
eeoc's
interpretation
of
the
supreme
court
analysis
in
sutton,
that
in
order
to
be
disabled,
the
plaintiff
must
show
that
her
manual
disability
involves
a
class
of
manual
activities
affecting
the
ability
of
to
perform
tasks
at
work.

interpret
it
that
way
and

we
have
to

it
that

in
order
to
save
it,

we?

working
is
a
major
life
activity?
justice
anthony
m.

it's
a
little
hard
to
think
of
a
disability
that
affects
a
broad
range
of
employment
tasks
that
doesn't
affect
other
areas
of
life.

wait
a
minute,
and
as
justice
breyer
said,
the-
these
are
evidentiary
m-
matters
that
go
to
a
a
a
a
larger
point.
