ms.

b.
mcdowell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
that
the
sixth
circuit
applied
an
incorrect
test
in
determining
whether
a
person
is
substantially
limited
in
the
major
life
activity
of
performing
manual
tasks.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
we
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that
may
be
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that
may
well
be
correct,
your
honor
.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
it's
not
irrelevant,
justice
scalia.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
e-
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
courts
of
appeals
thus
far
have
looked
at
aside
from
the
sixth
circuit,
of
course,
have
looked
to
those
manual
tasks
that
are
basic
to
everyday
life.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
oh,
certainly
it
would
become
a
jury
question
in
many
cases.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
eeoc
regs
that
you're
referring
to
discuss
the
major
life
activity
of
working.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
believe
this
route
is
consistent
wit-
with
what
the
agency
has
said,
specifically
that
one
should
consider
working
as
a
major
life
activity
only
if
a
plaintiff
cannot
satisfy
any
of
the
other
major
life
activities,
including
performing
manual
tasks.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
may
or
may
not,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
we
have
a
position
on
that
at
this
point,
justice
stevens.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
i
don't
think
you
look
only
at
the...
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
may
bell
[:
well]
well
be
relevant.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
may
i
answer,
your
honor?
in
focusing
on
a
major
life
activity
of
manual
tasks,
we
would
suggest
looking
at
the
generalized
person.
