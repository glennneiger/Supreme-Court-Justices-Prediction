mr.
roberts,
in
the
same
vein
as
justice
stevens'
question,
how
does
the
worker's
compensation
notion
of
disability
fit
in?
as
i
understand
it,
she
was
assessed
as
having
a
twenty
percent
what
was
it
partial
disability
for
worker's
compensation
purposes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
wouldn't
twenty
percent
limitation
twenty
percent
occupational
impairment
be
a
substantial
limitation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
roberts,
may
i
just
stop
you
on
something
you
just
said?
i
thought
the
sixth
circuit
said
in
its
opinion
that
it
had
considered
recreation,
household
chores,
living
generally,
as
well
as
the
work-related
impairments.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
mcdowell,
i
didn't
think
that
the
sixth
circuit
had
said
we're
looking
only
at
one
job.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
t-
t-
types.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
take
account
of
the
particular
individual?
for
example,
for
someone
who
is
making
a
high
income
as
a
corporate
executive,
it
wouldn't
matter
that
she
couldn't
vacuum
the
rug
because
she's
has
paid
someone
else
to
do
that
for
many
years.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
any
notion
of
what
percentage
of
the
population
would
be
taken
in
if
we
use
the
standard
n-
the
class
that
she
was
put
in
for
worker's
compensation
purposes,
t-
a
twenty
percent
occupational
impairment
how
many
people?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
that
one
one
of
the
problems
with
this
is
w-
we're
looking
at
the
entry
classification,
disability,
but
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
she
was
able
to
do
a
job
if
the
employer
sliced
it
a
certain
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
i
know
that
we
we
don't
get
to
what
is
the
how
much
accommodation
would
be
required,
but
it's
a
little
hard
to
to
keep
th-
that
from
view
because
if
the
employer
doesn't
have
would
not
have
to
make
the
accommodation
that
she's
seeking,
the-
then
this
case
is
not
very
significant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
the
employer
decided
to
change
what
the
workers
do,
and
as
i
un-
understand
assembly
lines,
that's
not
uncommon
to
take
people
from
doing
the
same
thing
every
day,
day
in
and
day
out,
train
them
for
several
jobs,
and
then
they
rotate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
standard
d-
of
accommodation,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i-
isn't
essential
isn't
the
standard,
is
it,
that
the
employer
has
to
show
that
it's
essential
that...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
as
to
manual
tasks,
are
you
asking
for
a
a
ruling
in
your
favor
on
summary
judgment
on
that,
or
are
you
saying
it
shouldn't
have
been
e-
effectively
summary
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
and
then
we
go
to
the
next
stage,
that
that
it
could
be
a
jury
question
o-
on
manual
tasks?
