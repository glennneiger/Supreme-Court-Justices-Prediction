justice
antonin
scalia
to
particularly
i
suppose
is
the
sentence
of
the
court's
opinion
which
says
the
fact
that
williams
can
perform
a
range
of
isolated,
non-repetitive
manual
tasks
performed
over
a
short
period
of
time,
such
as
tending
to
her
personal
hygiene
or
carrying
out
personal
or
household
chores,
does
not
affect
a
determination
that
her
impairment
substantially
limits
her
ability
cough>
to
perform
the
range
of
manual
tasks
associated
with
an
assembly
line
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
criterion
of
whether
she's
sub-
s-
she's
substantially
limited.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
going
to
say
if
if
you're
doing
it
under
under
under
the
major
life
activity
of
manual
tasks,
you
wouldn't
just
look
at
jobs.
justice
antonin
scalia
test
do
you
you
just
look
at
the
whole
scope
of
jobs,
or
isn't
it
just
limited
to
jobs
that
this
person
is
has
has
some
demonstrated
capacity
for
or
interest
in?
i
mean,
you
know,
what
if
i
can't
be
a
you
know,
a
jet
pilot?
you
know,
i
ha-
i'm
disabled
from
being
a
jet
pilot.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
particular
major
life
activity,
not
a
single
major
not
a
single
manual
task
and
not
a
limited
number
of
manual
tasks.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
the
trouble,
of
course,
is
is
is
defining
what
substantially
disabled
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah
well...
justice
antonin
scalia
because
that's
what
you
referred
to...
justice
antonin
scalia
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
most
severe
case
of
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
would
qualify?
justice
antonin
scalia
otherwise
you
could
have
answered
my
question
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
an
individualized
determination
because
the
most
severe
case
of
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
could
qualify
as
rendering
that
person
a
disabled
person
within
the
meaning
of
this
this
specialized
legislation.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rosenbaum,
co-
could
could
you
tell
us
what
you
want
us
to
do?
assuming
we
agree
with
you,
you
want
us
to
take
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
as
as
be-
as
a
as
affirming
a
summary
judgment
for
you
on
the
disability
portion.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
let's
assume
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
on
the
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
that's
what
they...
justice
antonin
scalia
wondering
why
we
can
do
that
when
the
sixth
circuit
hasn't
addressed
the
you
know,
the
other
areas
of
disability.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
other
the
other
two
issues?
i
mean,
the
the
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
purport
to
reach
the
working
as
a
substantial
life
activity
and
what
else?
lifting
as
a
substantial
life
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
acknowledge
we
would
have
to
remand
for
for
its
consideration
of
those.
