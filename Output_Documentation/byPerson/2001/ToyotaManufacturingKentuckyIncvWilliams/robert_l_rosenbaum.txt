mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
not
about
the
inability
to
perform
a
single
job.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
i
defend
the
result,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
not
in
its
entirety,
but
part
of
it
i
do.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
i
disagree
when
the
sixth
circuit
says
that
after
you
determine
an
individual
is
substantially
limited,
you
must
go
farther
and
that
individual
must
show
that
their
limitation
affects
their
work.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
yes,
sir,
and
i
appreciated
that.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
that
sentence
has
no
place
in
the
analysis
at
all.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
the
the
sixth...
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
found
that
she
has
the
impairment,
myotendinitis,
myofacial
pain,
carpal
tunnel
syndrome.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
differ
with
you.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
i
think
we
are
there.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
it
i
would
submit
it's
a
question
of
substantiality
always,
that
you're
correct
in
stating
that
the
degree
of
impairment
and
the
definition
of
the
major
life
activity
are
inevitably
linked
together
in
the
analysis.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
it
is
my
opinion
that
working
is
a
major
life
activity.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
yes,
th-
that's
why
this
ms.
williams'
case
is
a
strong
case.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
they
never
got
there
because
they
had
already
found
ms.
williams
to
be
disabled
as
a
matter
of
law
and
hence
it
was
unnecessary...
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
it
is
my
belief
that
that's
what
the
opinion...
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
i
i
have
to
give
a
caveat
about
my
remarks,
which
is
that
there
are
inconsistencies
in
this
opinion.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
your
honor,
that
is
one
of
the
inconsistencies.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
it
was
several
questions,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
the
first
of
all,
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
you
recited
i
think
is
sufficient
to
bring
her
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
have
limited
time,
and
and
i
can
tell
you
that
this
is
not
simply
a
sore
wrist
case.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
as
a
result
of
the
initial...
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
event,
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
the
worker's
compensation
award
is
probative
as
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
she
is
ada
disabled.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
we
know
that
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
an
individual
is
disabled
is
an
individualized
inquiry.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
if
it...
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
that's
right
because
the
regulations
say
is
that
if
they're
significantly
restricted
concerning
the
condition,
the
manner,
or
the
duration
of
the
activity,
then
they
are
substantially
disabled.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
i
c-
i
have
no
figures
that
would
relate
that
to
the
population
as
a
whole.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
s-
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
well,
i
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
explain
all
of
its
ramifications,
but
i
can
say
that
there
was
certainly
a
concern
that
people
who
were
labeled
disabled
would
be
stereotyped
and
that
employers
would
be
hesitant
to
give
them
the
same
vocational
opportunities
as
non-disabled
people
would
be,
even
though
the
disability
had
no
effect
on
the
job.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
that
issue
is
not
reached
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
well,
let
me
let
let
me
say
a
couple
of
things.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
in
the
sixth
circuit,
there's
the
case
of
kiphart
versus
saturn
where
that
issue
was
put
to
the
jury
where
the
employer
said,
you've
got
to
be
able
to
rotate
through
all
of
the
tasks
in
your
group,
and
since
you,
the
allegedly
disabled
person,
were
not
able
to,
we're
entitled
to
fire
you.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
there
are
reasonableness
considerations
to
accommodation.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
it's
not
a
defense
to
the
ada
claim
to
say,
look,
they
can
do
a
lot
of
stuff.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
not
in
total.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
the
case
is
before
the
court
in
the
procedural
posture
of
proceedings
for
a
summary
judgment.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
it
goes
to
the
jury.
mr.
robert
l.
rosenbaum
thank
you.
