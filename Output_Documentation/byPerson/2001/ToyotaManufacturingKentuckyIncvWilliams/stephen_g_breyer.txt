assume
that,
though,
in
some
cases,
couldn't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
not
you
do-
if
suppose
a
person
says
i
cannot
be
a
watchmaker
and
the
reason
he
can't
is
he's
blind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
though
he
only
mentioned
watchmaking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
it's
really
the
disability
that
we're
focusing
on,
and
in
the
circumstances
someone
like
that
would
be
able
not
only
not
to
perform
the
job
but
also
not
to
do
the
things
that
the
judge
said
below,
a
reasonable
inference
from
the
nature
of
the
disability.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
w-
w-
my
until
you
said
the
last
part,
my
thought
was,
well,
we
need
a
trial
on
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
serious
is
this
disability?
what
d-
is
does
it
disqualify
her
from
doing?
but
do
we
have
to
go
on
to
categorize
between
whether
it's
working,
gardening,
what
is
a
major
life
activity?
i
mean,
isn't
it
just
is
this
person
hurt
badly
enough
that
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
things
that
she
can't
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
bothering
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
to
use
a
more
broad,
general
judgment,
is
this
person
incapable
of
doing
a
lot
of
things
that
people
do
in
life.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
conceptually
it
seems
to
work
better
your
your
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
taking
the
wrong
they're
taking
the
wrong
approach
in
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
so,
that's
u-
that's
what
i'd
like
to
know
how
to
deal
with
exactly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
get
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
then
i
saw
the
eeoc
reg,
which
talks
about
the
major
this
the
major
life
activity
of
working,
and
that
would
be
a
category
mistake
because
it
isn't
it
i-
there
isn't
a
major
life
activity
of
working.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
that
suggests
that
those
people,
the
people
who
are
in
a
sense
not
the
most
disabled,
but
the
people
who
are
not
quite
in
that
category
are
the
ones
who
are
really
discriminated
against?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
the
ones
who
can't
work
at
all,
obviously,
are
not
discriminated
against.
