justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
just
ask
if
at
at
the
outset,
so
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
comment
on
there's
expert
testimony,
as
i
read
the
briefs,
that
on
your
opponent's
side
that
she's
suffers
a
lack
of
access
to
the
labor
market
from
fifty
to
fifty-five
percent
of
the
jobs,
both
nationwide
and
in
kentucky.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say
it
was
rejected
by
the
district
court,
you
don't
mean
it
was
inadmissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roberts,
can
i
just
interrupt
again?
i
you've
explained
why
the
fifty
percent
figure
is
is
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
it
is
it
is
it
your
view
that
by
including
the
non-work
im-
impairment
that
she
has,
you
sort
of
increase
the
universe
of
things
she
has
to
she
you
compare
it
to,
and
therefore,
the
there's
a
smaller
percentage
of
an
impairment,
and
therefore,
it's
not
substantial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
refers
to
painting,
plumbing,
and
roofing,
et
cetera.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
i
suppose
it's
perfectly
obvious
a
person
who
can't
raise
their
hands
above
heart
level
couldn't
paint
the
ceiling
at
least.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
most
painters
are
not
limited
to
just
painting
floors,
i
don't
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
is
it
relevant
that
she
may
not
be
able
to
perform
a
lot
of
jobs
she
never
performed?
for
example,
is
it
relevant
that
she
couldn't
be
a
roofer,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
her
employment
history
and
that's
the
only
possible
thing
we
look
at
in
determining
whether
her
working
ability
has
been
impaired.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
that
she
couldn't
be
a
roofer,
electrician,
or
a
painter
or
a
lot
of
other
things.
