[inaudible]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
question
like
substantial,
certainly
you
would
get
to
a
jury
question
at
some
point,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rosenbaum,
so
far
as
the
question
presented
here
is,
do
you
are
you
would
defend
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
the
reasoning?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
do

disagree?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the

did
not
say
simply
that
summary
judgment
should
not
have
been
granted
for
toyota,
but
that
summary
judgment
should
be
granted
for
miss
williams?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
no
surely
we
shouldn't
have
to
talk
about
beliefs
as
to
what
an
opinion
said.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
one
of
the...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosenbaum.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
no.
