why
why
did
the
court
of
appeals
avoid
addressing
the
work
approach?
it
was
it
because
it
thought
this
court
had
rejected
that?
justice

should
we
address
that,
or
because
it
was
not
addressed
below,
leave
that
alone?

well
in
in
looking
at
a
substantial
limitation,
do
we
focus
on
the
things
that
the
person
cannot
do
or
the
things
they
still
can
do
or
both?
justice

in

approach,
how
how
is
the
fact
finder
supposed
to
decide
which
manual
tasks
are
sufficiently
important
to
constitute
a
substantial
limitation?
i
mean,
how
do
you
weigh
that?
h-
how
do
we
decide
it?
is
there
any
guidance

o'connor
of
workman's

schemes
help
us
in
giving
meaning
to
substantial

language
under
the

act?
i
mean,
it
wasn't
intended
to
replace
workman's
comp
schemes,
and
somebody
who
gets
a
bad
back
or
a

presumably
can
resort
to
workman's
comp
to
get
some

and
some
relief.

o'connor
don't
you
have
to
look
at
both
in
in
trying
to
assess
the
extent
of
somebody's
incapacity
to
do
a
major
life

justice

this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
respondent,
who
had
worked
on
an
assembly
line
at
the
petitioner’s
automobile
manufacturing
plant
in
kentucky,
sued
the
petitioner
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
referred
to
as
the
ada.
she
claimed
to
be
disabled
because
of
her
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
and
related
impairments
and
alleged
that
the
petitioner
had
failed
to
provide
her
with
reasonable
accommodation
as
required
under
the
act.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
toyota
finding
that
the
respondent
was
not
disabled
under
the
ada
because
her
impairments
did
not
substantially
limit
any
of
her
major
life
activities.
she
did
not
have
a
record
of
substantially
limiting
impairment
and
the
employer
had
not
regarded
her
as
having
such
impairment.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
finding
that
her
impairments
substantially
limited
her
in
the
major
life
activity
of
performing
manual
tasks
and
that
she
was
therefore
entitled
to
partial
summary
judgment
on
the
issue
of
whether
she
was
disabled.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
an
order
to
demonstrate
that
she
was
disabled
due
to
her
substantial
limitation
in
performing
manual
tasks
that
the
respondent
had
to
show
only
that
her
manual
disability
involved
a
class
of
manual
activities
affecting
the
ability
to
perform
those
tasks
at
work.
the
respondent
had
satisfied
this
test
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
because
her
impairments
prevented
her
from
doing
the
tasks
associated
with
certain
types
of
manual
assembly
line
jobs,
manual
product
handling
jobs,
and
manual
building
trade
jobs
that
require
the
gripping
of
tools
and
repetitive
work
with
hands
and
arms
extended
or
at
above
shoulder
levels
for
extended
periods
of
time.
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
the
court
of
appeals
disregarded
evidence
that
respondent
could
tend
to
her
personal
hygiene
and
carry
out
personal
and
household
chores
explaining
that
such
evidence
did
not
affect
its
determination.
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
it
did
not
apply
to
proper
standard
in
determining
whether
respondent
was
disabled
under
the
ada,
because
it
analyzed
only
a
limited
class
of
manual
tasks
and
failed
to
asks
whether
the
respondent’s
impairments
prevented
of
restricted
her
from
performing
tasks
that
are
of
central
importance
to
most
people’s
daily
life.
the
ada
requires
that
an
impairment
substantially
limit
an
individual
in
the
performance
of
one
of
more
major
life
activities
for
the
impairment
to
qualify
as
a
disability.
the
phrase,
"major
life
activities"
refers
to
those
activities
that
are
of
central
importance
to
daily
life.
in
order
for
performing
manual
tasks
to
fit
into
this
category,
a
category
that
includes
such
basic
abilities
as
walking,
seeing,
and
hearing,
the
manual
tasks
and
questions
must
be
central
to
daily
life.
the
court
of
appeals
erred
by
focusing
only
on
respondent’s
inability
to
perform
manual
tasks
associated
with
her
particular
job.
in
this
case,
repetitive
work
with
hands
and
arms
extended
at
or
above
shoulder
levels
for
extended
periods
of
time
which
was
the
manual
tasks
relied
on
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
an
important
of
most
people’s
daily
lives.
the
court
therefore
should
not
have
considered
that
inability
as
sufficient
proof
that
she
was
substantially
limited
in
performing
manual
tasks
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
disregarded
the
evidence
that
respondent
could
tend
to
her
personal
hygiene
and
carry
out
personal
or
household
chores.
these
are
the
types
of
manual
tasks
of
central
importance
to
people’s
daily
life
and
should
have
been
part
of
the
court’s
analysis.
on
ths
record,
it
was
inappropriate
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
grant
partial
summary
judgment
to
respondent
on
the
issue
of
whether
she
was
substantially
limited
in
performing
manual
tasks.
we
reversed
the
judgment
and
remand
the
case
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
