justice
ruth
bader

mr.
goodman,
why
do
you
start
with
conley
v.
gibson
rather
than
dioguardi
v.
durning.
i
thought
that
was
always
the
classic.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
negligently
drove.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goodman,
if--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
judge
said,
okay,
this
complaint
measures
up
to
conley
v.
goodman,
but
i
don't
want
to
allow
extensive
discovery
fishing
expeditions,
what
can
the
judge
do
to
curtail
the
pretrial
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
certainly
not
required
to
plead
the
evidence
in
support
of
your
charge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
complaint,
mr.
minear,
require
you
under
the
federal
rules
to
put
in
all
the
elements
of
a
cause
of
action
in
order
to
survive
a
12(b)(6)
motion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
why
these
rules
religiously
avoid
determining
cause
of
action.
you
do
not
have
to
plead
the
elements
of
a
cause
of
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
brody,
why
is
it
any
more
or
less
of
a
conclusion,
any
different
from
negligently
drove?
form
9
says
that's
enough,
just
say
negligent...
tell
the
time
and
place
and
say,
defendant
negligently
drove.
you
don't
have
to
say
whether
he
was
speeding,
or
went
out
of
his
line,
or
anything
like
that.
you
just
say
negligent.
isn't
that
a
conclusion,
that
he
drove
in
a
manner
that
was
negligent?
what
facts...
flush
that
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
that...
what
you
added
maybe
so,
but
the
form
doesn't
say
that.
it
says,
gives
the
place,
and
it
says,
negligently
drove.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there
was
a
statement
here
that
other
people
who
had
been...
were
not
let
go,
people
for
whom
there
was
cause.
wasn't
there
something
to
that
effect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
can
still
use
them
to
show
that
is
the
mind
set
of
the
employer.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
asking
to
have
facts
alleged
in
this
complaint
which,
like
it
or
not,
the
federal
rules
don't
require.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
case
are
you
mentioning
now?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
a
12(b)(6)
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
complaint
was
held
insufficient?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
sounds
like
evidence
again.
there
is
notice
that
the
complaint
is
that
i
was
fired
because
of
my
age
and
my
national
origin.
now,
it's...
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
second
circuit,
and
that's
why
i
mentioned
dioguardi
v.
durning,
because
even
if
it
doesn't
come
from
this
court,
i
assumed
that
what
judge
clark
wrote
way
back
then
is
still
law
of
the
circuits,
for
the
second
circuit,
which
is
why
i
find
it
very
puzzling
this
court
reached
the
result
it
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
mean
by
elements?
i
thought
it
was,
indeed,
hornbook
law
that
you
are
not
required
under
the
federal
rules
to
plead
the
elements
that
constitute
a,
quote,
cause
of
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
what
he
did
was
not
equivalent
to
defendant
owes
plaintiff
x
dollars
for
goods
sold
and
delivered
on
a
certain
date.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
lot
more
than
that
in
this
complaint.
it
does
run
on
for
several
pages
doesn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
huge
difference
between
pleading
a
case
and
proving
a
case,
and
pleading
a
case
does
not
require
you
to
put
forward
your
evidence.
you
could
ask
pinpointed
questions.
you
say
what
was
wrong
with
this
is
they
didn't
identify
the
national
origin,
whatever.
you
send
a
set
of
interrogatories,
get
the
answers
to
those
questions,
and
if
they
show
that
everybody
else
is
hungarian,
he's
out
of
court.
you
could
have
asked
for
a
more
definite
statement,
i
suppose,
if
you
said
this
is
so
vague
i
can't
answer
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
count,
rule
11...
this
person
was
represented
before
the
district
court,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
fact,
the
same
counsel,
and
there
was
a
representation
to
the
court
made
by
the
attorney
under
rule
11
that
says
there's
a
good
basis
in
law
and
fact
for
this
charge.
does
that
count
for
nothing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
best
case
you
have
for
that
is
the
statute
of
limitations
case,
which
is
an
affirmative
defense
that,
if
the
time
is
up,
that's
it.
there's
nothing...
you
could
have
all
the
beautiful
facts
in
the
world,
so
that
statute
of
limitations,
you
can
answer
the
complaint
with
that
and
get
summary
judgment
on
this
spot,
or
even,
arguably,
12(b)(6),
but
you
have
given
the
statute
of
limitations
as
the
only
pleading
case.
the
others
were
all
cases
that
plaintiffs
won,
and
you're
searching
for
language
that
you
can
pull
out
of
them
to
say,
ah,
but
in
other
circumstances
they
would
have
lost.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
a
dismissal
under
12(b)(6)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
to
file
a
paper
that's
called
the
complaint,
and
a
right-to-sue
letter
is
not
that.
you
can't
go
into
court
and
say,
here's
a
nice
letter,
court,
and
i'd
like
you
to
proceed.
you
have
to
have
a
complaint.
the
rules
say
that.
the
right-to-sue
letter
isn't
a
complaint,
so
i
don't
think
that
takes
you
very
far.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
confused.
the
right-to-sue
letter
would
have
come
from
the
eeoc.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
not
the
plaintiff's
pleading.
that
was
a
notice
from
the
eeoc.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
case
that
you
cited,
santa
fe,
that
was
a
case
that
the
plaintiff...
where
the
plaintiff
prevailed
against
the
12(b)(6).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
thought
you
gave
that
to
us
as
an
example
of
where
mcdonnell
douglas
had
been
applied
at
the
pleading
stage
to
dismiss
the
case
on
12(b)(6)
grounds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
all
of
your
cases,
then,
are
cases
in
which
the
plaintiff
surmounted
the
12(b)(6)
hurdle,
and
there's
language
in
that...
you...
for
this
mythical
case
that
hasn't
yet
occurred.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
i
allege
that
the
defendant
gave
me
a
dirty
look,
i'm
going
to
be
tossed
out
on
12(b)(6),
and
i
could
describe
all
the
grimaces
and
everything
else,
and
it
won't
do
me
any
good
because
the
law
doesn't
recognize
such
a
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
when
you...
there
is
evidence
outside
the
four
corners
of
the
complaint,
then
you
can
bring
it
as
a
rule
56
summary
judgment
motion,
not
a
12(b)(6)
motion,
so
technically
that,
if
you're
supposed
to
look
only
to
the
complaint
on
a
12(b)(6)
motion
that
should
not
have
been
considered.
