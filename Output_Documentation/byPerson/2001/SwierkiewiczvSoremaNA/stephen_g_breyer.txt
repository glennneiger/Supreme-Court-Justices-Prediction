stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
a
person
simply
feels...
he's
been
fired,
and
he
thinks
his
work
was
good,
and
the
employer
said
it
was
bad,
so
he
thinks,
they
couldn't
have
fired
me
because
my
work
was
bad.
it's
good.
what
reason
could
there
have
been?
well,
i
sense
an
anti-hungarian
atmosphere
in
this
office.
that's
it.
all
right,
so
they
write
that
into
the
complaint
right
there.
now,
you
see,
i
did
good
work,
he
said
it
was
bad
work,
he
fired
me,
and
i
think
it's
because
i'm
a
hungarian,
all
right.
good
faith.
he
believes
it.
now...
automatically
get
discovery
and
costs,
quite
a
lot
of
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
a
judge
refuse
discovery
on
that...
on
these--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
we're
talking
about
discovery.
how
does
the
judge
refuse
discovery
in
my
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then,
what
the
second
circuit
is
actually
saying
is,
since
the
judge
can't
refuse
discovery
in
my
case,
let's
go
back
and
look
and
see
what
the
cause
of
action
is,
and
the
cause
of
action
is
such
that
my
case
doesn't
really
fall
within
it.
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
they're
driving
at.
it
must
be
something
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry,
then
i'm
confused,
because
i...
you
don't...
an
inference
isn't
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
allege.
an
inference
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
make,
so
you
must
be
saying
he
has
to
allege
facts
that
would
give
rise
to
an
inference,
or
if
you...
are
you
saying
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would...
you
have...
he
has
to
allege
certain
facts
that
would
give
rise
to
an
inference,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
he
did
allege
was,
he
alleged
as
a
matter
of
fact
over
2
years
people
who
he
alleges
were
factually
less
qualified
and
were
either
younger
or
not
hungarian
obtained
all
kinds
of
advantages
that
he
did
not,
and
then
he
was
fired
because
of
his
grievances,
and
a
fair
reading
is
that
is
both
a
factual
allegation,
and
grievance
refers
to
what
he
called...
said
earlier
in
the
complaint,
so
why
don't
those
facts
give
rise
to
an
inference
that
his...
what
he
said
was
the
conclusion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
not?
i
mean,
it
doesn't
mean,
of
course,
that
it
is,
but
it
is
evidence
that
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
never
seen
an
allegation
of
an
inference.
i've
only
seen
an
allegation
of
facts,
and
i
bring
this
up
again
because
now
you
say
he
doesn't
have
to
allege
facts,
but
i
thought
your
whole
case
was
he
did
have
to
allege
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
you're
saying
he
has
to
allege
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so...
all
right.
i
don't
want
to
go
in
circles,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
that
you
agree
about
that.
you're
talking
about
a
failure
to
allege
certain
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
addition
to
what
he
said,
he
also
said
that
everybody
else,
and
he
names
about
10
people,
who
were
dismissed
were
dismissed
for
cause
and
given
severance
benefits,
but
he
was
dismissed
without
cause
and
wasn't
given
severance
benefits.
well,
that
seems
directly
related
to
the
dismissal
and,
moreover,
reading
it
in
light
of
what
he
said
before,
he
alleges
as
a
conclusion
that
this
shows
i
was
dismissed
without
severance
because
of
my
nationality
or
because
of
my
age.
why
aren't
those
facts
that
give
rise
to
an
inference,
at
least
as
much
as,
i
was
in
an
accident
and
therefore
he's
negligent?
