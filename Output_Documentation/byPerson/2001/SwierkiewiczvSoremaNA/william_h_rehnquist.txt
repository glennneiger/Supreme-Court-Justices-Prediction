chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
00-1853,
akos
swierkiewicz
v.
sorema.
mr.
goodman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
would
have
to
also
allege,
wouldn't
you,
that
you
were
discriminated
against
because
of
your
race,
or
because
of
your
nationality?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
again
say
that
was
done
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
the
leading
case?
i
would
think
you
might
say
a
case
from
this
court
were
a
leading
case--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--as
opposed
to
one
from
the
second
circuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
goodman.
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
nine
pages
long,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
necessarily
say
that's
a
short
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
that's
the
difference,
basically,
between
a
12(b)(6)
motion
and
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
is
that
the
12(b)(6)
is
just
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings,
and
the
summary
judgment
is,
presumably
you
can
consider
affidavits
and
depositions
that
are
taken
outside
the
pleadings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
ms.
brody,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
isn't
that
fair
notice,
ms.
brody?
he
claimed
the
employer
discriminated
against
him
because
of
his
nationality
and
because
of
his
age.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
it's
a
conclusion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
surely
the
same
inferences
could
be
drawn
here,
couldn't
they?
it
seems
to
me
this
is
more
precise,
these
allegations,
than
the
allegations
justice
ginsburg
just
described
about
the
simple
word
negligently.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
have
to
infer
it.
it
says
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
here
he
alleged
that
he
was
terminated
because
of
his
nationality
and
because
of
his
age.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he...
but
he
says
that
he
was
terminated
for
that
reason.
i
think
if
you
want
to
have
him
spell
it
out
in
more
detail,
you're
asking
that
he
plead
evidence,
which
i
don't
think
is
required.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
even
one
of
them
was
a
good
claim,
it
shouldn't
have
been
dismissed.
are
you
saying
that
neither
the
demotion
nor
the
termination
is
sufficiently
pleaded?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
he
nowhere
allege
that
his
firing
was
because
he
was
hungarian,
or
because
he
was...
because
of
his
age?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
that
really
essential
to
pleading
a
claim
for
relief
here?
i
mean,
supposing
he
had
left
out
what
happened
to
these
six
people
and
simply
said
that
he
was
dismissed
from
his
employment
because
he
was
hungarian
and
because
of
his
age,
what
more
than
what
i've
just
said
ought
he
to
have
alleged
to
have
complied
with
the
bare
minimum?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mcdonnell
douglas
i
don't
think
was
ever
meant
to
be
a
pleading
requirement.
it
was
a
way,
as
justice
scalia
said,
to
survive
summary
judgment
and
get
to
the
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
think
many
of
us
would
agree
with
you
that
it
would
be
sensible
for
it
to
be
so
used,
but
the
rules
just
don't
provide
for
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brody.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goodman,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goodman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
00-1853,
swierkiewicz
versus
sorema
n.a.
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
