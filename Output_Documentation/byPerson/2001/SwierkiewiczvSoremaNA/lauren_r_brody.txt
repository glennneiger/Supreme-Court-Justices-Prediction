ms.
lauren
r.
brody
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
a
plaintiff
must
allege
an
inference
of
discrimination
in
order
to
stay
the
claim
under
title
vii
in
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act.
the
petitioner
here
alleged
that
his
employment
was
terminated
on
account
of
his
national
origin
and
age.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
found
that
this
allegation
was
insufficient
to
sustain
a
claim,
and
that
petitioner
had--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--your
honor,
no.
the
memorandum--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--you
can
look
at
the
case
without
looking
at
the
memorandum,
because
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
memorandum
outlined
the
petitioner's
grievances
with
the
company
and
requested
a
severance
package.
there
is
nothing
from
that
allegation
which
suggests
that
there
was
any
kind
of
discrimination,
and
that
is
sufficient
in
order
for
the
court--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--there
are
no
other
allegations
in
this
complaint
that
raise
an
inference.
what
the
petitioner
has
alleged
here
is
generally
that
he
was
hungarian,
that
he
was
a
hungarian...
that
he
was
of
hungarian
heritage--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--justice
stevens,
that's
conclusion.
that
is
not
permitted
by
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
or
by
this
court's
decisions,
including
conley
v.
gibson,
which
said
that
in
order
to
provide
fair
notice
the
plaintiff
must
provide
in
the
complaint
a
statement
of
the
claims
that
gives
fair
notice
of
what
the
claims
is,
as
well
as
the
grounds
on
which--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--yes,
he
does,
your
honor,
but
that's...
mr.
chief
justice,
but
that's
a
conclusion,
and
that
is
not
sufficient
under
federal
rules.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
it's
a
conclusion
that
does
not
set
forth
what
rule
8
requires,
and
rule
8
says
that
you
have
to
indicate
what
the
grounds
on
which
the
claim
is
based--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--your
honor,
if
you
look
at
that
complaint,
that
form
9
complaint,
which
alleges
negligence,
it
sets
forth
all
the
elements
of
the
claim.
it
alleges
a
duty.
the
defendant
was
driving
on
a
highway
and
had
an
obligation
to
do
so
with
care.
it
alleges
a
breach
of
that
duty,
which
is
that
he
drove--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--those
are
reasonably
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
a
very
simple
negligence
action.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case,
because
in
the
negligence
action
when
an
individual
drives
a
car
into
another
individual,
it
can
be
inferred
that
negligence
was
involved
in
that.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
it
does
say
it,
your
honor,
but
in
an
employment
situation,
when
an
individual
is
terminated,
individuals
are
terminated
every
day.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
there
is
nothing
that
connects
his
nationality
and
his
age
with
the
termination
of
his
employment.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
mr.
chief
justice,
we
are
not
asking
that
a
plaintiff
plead
evidence.
we
agree
that
that
is
not
appropriate
at
the
pleading
stage,
and
a
complaint
does
not
have
to
contain
any
evidence.
all
that
a
complaint
has
to
contain
are
allegations
based
on
the
plaintiff's
good
faith
belief
that
he
was
terminated
because
the
circumstances
indicated
that
there
was
discrimination.
all
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
allege
is
some
inference
of
discrimination,
and
that
inference
is
not
the
employer's
reason
for
the
termination.
there
are
surrounding
circumstances
that
occur
when
an
employee
is
terminated.
it
does
not
occur
in
a
vacuum,
and
this
court
has
identified
various
circumstances
under
which
the
inference
arises.
it
arises
when
one
employee
is
treated
differently
than
another
employee
because
of
their
protected
class.
it
arises
when--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--justice
ginsburg,
there
is
nothing
in
connection
with
the
termination
of
employment
that
indicates
that
the
petitioner
was
treated
differently
from
other
employees.
there
were
allegations
that
were
made
relating
to
an
act
that
occurred
2
years
later...
excuse
me,
2
years
earlier,
in
1995,
when
the
petitioner
claims
that
he
was
demoted,
and
he
makes
various
allegations
about
other
individuals
who
were
of
different
nationalities,
different
citizenships,
and
different
ages,
but
he
does
not
connect
any
of
those
allegations
to
his
situation,
which
is
being
a
united
states
citizen
of
hungarian
heritage.
the
problem
is
that
those
prior
allegations
relating
to
an
act
which
occurred
prior
to
his
termination
and
which
are
time-barred
do
not
have
any
reference--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--justice
ginsburg,
i
respectfully
disagree.
we
were
not
asking
the
petitioner
to
allege
facts.
we
were
only
asking
him
to
make
good
faith
allegations
which
would
give
rise
to
some
inference
of
discrimination.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
that...
facts,
factual
allegations.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
that
is
correct.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
those
allegations
import
into
this
case
a
concept
which
has
never
been
asserted,
and
that
is
this
continuing
violation
theory.
the
petitioner...
there
are
two
separate
acts
here.
there
is
a
demotion
and
a
termination,
and
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
link
those
by
making
the
conclusory
allegation
that
there
was
ongoing
discrimination
during
this
2-year
period,
but
this
court
has
already
held
in
rix
that
a
conclusory
allegation
like
that
cannot
link
two
separate
acts.
what
we
need
to
do
is
look
at
the
circumstances
at
the
time
of
the
termination
of
employment.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
rix
v.
delaware
state
college.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
that
was
a
12(b)(6)
case,
your
honor.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
the
complaint
was
held
insufficient,
and
this
court
refused--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--that
is
correct.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
but
it's
not
a
matte
of
unreasonableness.
it's
a
matter
of,
there's
one
act
which
is
time-barred,
and
there's
a
second
act,
and
you
could
not
link
them,
especially
in
this
particular
case,
where
the
allegations
relating
to
the
so-called
demotion
are
totally
directed
to
the
demotion
and
don't
carry
over
into
the
termination
of
an
employment.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
the
demotion
claim
cannot
be
considered
because
it's
time-barred.
the
petitioner
did
not
file
an
eeoc
charge
issue
within
300
days
of
that
act,
so
that
is
something
that
is
an
unfortunate
event
in
history,
as
has
been
stated
by
the
court
in
rix,
and
it
cannot
be
used
to
bolster
a
claim
that
occurred,
or
that
might
have
arisen
2
years
later.
the
fact
that
an
employer,
and
we
don't
think
he
did,
may
have
taken
an
act
that
was
discriminated,
was
discriminatory
2
years
prior
to
the
act
that
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
complaint,
doesn't
mean
that
the
second
act
is
also
discriminatory,
and
they
cannot
be
combined
and
put
together--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--your
honor,
in
certain
situations
such
as
a
harassment
case
where
there
is...
are
continuing
acts
of
discrimination
that
occur,
that
might
be
appropriate,
but
in
a
case
like
this,
where
separate
and
discrete
acts
are
being
alleged,
and
the
first
act
was
completed
in
1995...
nothing
more
happened
after
that...
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
for
linking
these
two
acts
together
and
basing
the
termination
on
the
demotion
allegations.
in
fact,
to
do
so
would
really
circumvent
the
statute
of
limitations,
because
it
would
permit
a
plaintiff
to
base
a
present
claim
on
a
time-barred
claim,
and
that--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--he
makes
the
conclusory
allegations
that
i
was
terminated
because
of
my
national
origin
and
age,
but
that
does
not...
that
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
sustain
the
claim,
a
claim,
and
that
is
what
this
court
has
stated
in
conley,
in
which
it
emphasized
that
the
plaintiff
had
to
set
forth
the
grounds
on
which
the
claim
rests.
i
believe
that
this
court
also
has
endorsed
that
view
in
the
other
12(b)(6)
cases
that
it
has
considered,
such
as
rix,
such
as
sutton,
which
justice
o'connor
went
through
and
analyzed
the
statutory
elements
of
the
claims
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
claims
had
met
them.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
there
was
nothing
lacking
in
the
complaint
in
conley.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
it,
it
alleges
all
the
elements
of
the
claim,
and
it
does
so
on
a
rather
specific
basis.
it
states
in
conley
that
there
were
45
positions
that
were
purportedly
abolished
that
were
held
by
african
americans.
the
complaint
then
goes
on
to
allege
that
caucasians
were
hired
to
fill
those
45
positions.
it
then
goes
on
to
allege
that
the
union
did
not
represent
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
and
did
not
try
to
protect
their
jobs,
and
then
it
says
there's
a
violation
of
the
statute.
what
the
defendant
was
trying
to
do
in
conley
was
to
get
specific
and
particular
information
about
what
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
were
violated
and
other
specific
information
which
is
not
required,
so
that
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
complaints
that
have
been
considered
by
this
court
and
even
by
the
circuit
courts,
you
see
that
each
of
those
complaints
are
sufficient
on
their
face
and
they
contain
more
than
enough
allegations
to
state
the
elements
of
the
claims.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
i--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--i
think
the
case
that
we
have,
the
best
case
that
we
have
to
refer
to
is
the
sutton
case,
where
the
court
looked
at
each
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
determined
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
was
disabled,
and
refused
to
accept
the
conclusory
allegation
that
the
plaintiff
made
that
she
was
disabled.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
that's
correct.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
your
honor--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--and
your
honor,
this
is
not
a
case
about
the
absence
of
detail
or
specificity.
this
is
a
case
about
allegations
being
made
giving
rise
to
some
sort
of
inference,
some
sort
of
suggestion,
some
hint
of
discrimination,
and
there
is
nothing
here--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
dioguardi
complaint
you
will
see
that
all
of
the
elements
of
the
claim
are
alleged
in
that
complaint.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
there
has
to
be
something
in
the
complaint
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
claim
and,
in
a
discrimination
case,
the
heart
of
the
claim
is
the
discrimination.
in
a
breach
of
contract
case,
the
heart
of
the
claim
is
the
breach,
and
if
you
identify
the
contract,
you
identify
the
breach,
you
identify
the
injury,
you
have
satisfied
the
elements,
or
the
essence
of
that
claim,
and
that
is
required
in
a
discrimination
case.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
no,
your
honor.
no,
your...
he's
not
made
the
showing
that
rule
8
requires,
and
there's
a
reason
that
the
word
showing
is
used
in
rule
8.
it
doesn't
say,
all
you
have
to
do
is
identify
the
claim...
this
is
a
title
vii
claim...
and
it
doesn't
say
that
then
you
can
follow
that
by
conclusion
i
was
discharged
because
of
my
national
origin--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--it
goes
on
for
several
pages,
but
the
facts
do
not
support
the
conclusion,
that
is,
the
factual
allegations,
and
there
are
factual
allegations
in
this
complaint,
and
interestingly,
petitioner
doesn't
claim
that
he
doesn't
have
to
allege
that
he
was
a
member
of
a
protected
class,
he
doesn't
claim
that
he
doesn't
have
to
allege
that
he
was
qualified,
and
he
doesn't
claim
that
he
did
not
have
to
allege
that
there
was
an
adverse
employment
action.
all
he
claims
is
that
he
doesn't
have
to
set
forth
any
allegations
that
would
give
rise
to
this
inference
of
discrimination,
and
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
the
inference.
it
just
has
to
be--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--your
honor,
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
four
corners
of
the
complaint
and
determine
whether
there
were
any
other
allegations
in
it.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
your
honor,
i
believe
under
mcdonnell
douglas
if
you're
going
to
base
your
claim
on
an
inferential
case
that
you
do
need
to
allege
and
prove
the
elements
of
the
prima
facie
case.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
that
is
correct.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
your
honor,
the
word
evidence
has
been
used
frequently,
and
neither
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
court,
or
the
respondent
here
is
suggesting
that
a
petitioner
or
plaintiff
must
allege
facts
or
set
forth
evidence.
all
he
has
to
do
is
have
a
good
faith
basis
for
making
allegations,
and
if
you
look
at
all
the
discrimination
cases
that
have
come
before
this
case,
going
back
to
mcdonnell
douglas,
there
has
always
been
an
allegation
of
some
inference
of
discrimination,
and
that--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--the
case
is
that
he
has
to
make
factual
allegations.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
yes.
allegations
are
based
on
facts,
and
i
think
that
you
have
to
make
allegations
which
have
some
factual
basis
in
order
to
go
forward
with
the
case.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
because
those
allegations
alone
are
insufficient
in
that
he
does
not
allege
the
national
origin
of
any
of
those
individuals,
some
of
whom
could
be
hungarian.
he
doesn't
state.
he
doesn't
allege
the
age
of
those
individuals
who
were
terminated
and
allegedly
received
severance
packages.
for
all
we
know,
they
could
be
over
50.
there's
nothing
that
indicates
that
those
people
received
the
treatment
that
they
did
because
of
their
national
origin.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
what
he
ought
to
have
alleged
is
the
kind
of
allegation
that
is
alleged
in
mcdonnell
douglas,
that
is
alleged
in
mcdonald
v.
santa
fe,
that
is
alleged
in
rix.
all
these
allegations
in
all
these
cases
raise--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--mcdonnell
douglas
can
be
used
as
a
pleading
requirement,
and
it
is
sensible
for
it
to
be
so
used--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--because
at
the
pleading
stage--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--mcdonnell
douglas
reflects
title
vii.
it
incorporates
the
provisions
of
title
vii,
and
in
order
to
eventually
prove
a
title
vii
case,
which
is
an
inferential
case,
you're
going
to
have
to
plead
the
elements--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--your
honor,
the
idea
that
a
complaint
need
only
allege
a
conclusion
in
order
to
proceed
with
discovery
and
summary
judgment
and
trial--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--correct.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
that
does
count
for
something,
but
the
problem
which
we're
addressing
here
is
that
there
are
not
sufficient
allegations
in
this
complaint
which
indicate
that
discrimination
has
anything
to
do
with--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--i
think
that
if
you
look
at
mcdonald
v.
santa
fe
trail
you
will
see
that
the
court
there
utilized
mcdonnell
douglas
on
a
12(b)(6)
motion,
and
it
examined
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
there
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
had
alleged
facts
which
could
give
rise
to
an
inference
of
discrimination.
that
was
one
of
the
issues
in
mcdonnell
douglas,
and
that
is
a
case
where
this
court
applied
mcdonnell
douglas
and
required
an
inference
of
discrimination.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
that
is
the
case,
mcdonald
v.
santa
fe
trail
transportation.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
that
was
a
dismissal
on
a
12(b)(6).
the
other
case
that
i
would
refer
the
court
to
is
baldwin
county
welcome
center
v.
brown,
which
is
a
case
where
this
court
held
that
a
right-to-sue
letter
issued
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
did
not
constitute
a
complaint
because
it
did
not
comply
with
rule
8
notice
and
did
not
set
forth
the
factual
basis
for
a
claim.
a
right-to-sue
letter
has
all
the
information
that
the
plaintiff
put
in
his--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--well,
i
don't
believe
that
you
have
to
have
a
document
that's
entitled,
complaint,
in
order
to
file
it
as
a
complaint
with
the
court.
this
court
did
not
hold
that
the
right-to-sue
letter
was
not
appropriate
as
a
complaint
because
of
its
title.
this
court
held
that
there
were
no
factual
allegations
contained
in
that
complaint
for
which
a
basis
of
the
claim
could
be
stated.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
that's
correct,
and
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
took
the
right-to-sue
letter,
went
to
court,
and
filed
it.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
well,
the
plaintiff
called
that
his
pleading,
and
he
proceeded
on
that
as
his
pleading.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
your
honor,
that's
an
excellent
question,
and
i
think
there
has
been
a
use
of
these
terms
very
loosely.
i
believe
that
what
he
petitioner
is
arguing
is
the
latter
point,
that
he
was
discriminated
against
because
he
was
not
french,
and
i
believe
it
was
because
he
was
not
a
french
citizen.
he
alleges
that
these
other
individuals
in
the
company
were
french
national.
in
his
eeoc
charge
he
makes
clear
that
he
regards
them
as
french
citizens
and,
in
fact,
one
of
them,
one
of
these
french
nationals
is
actually
of
greek
heritage,
so
the
discrimination
that
we
re
talking
about
here
is
really
not
based
on
national
origin
at
all.
it's
based
on
citizenship
and,
as
this
court
knows
from
espinoza,
that
is
not
covered
by
title
vii.
it
isn't
a
proper
basis
for
a
discrimination
claim.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
oh,
your
honor,
i
may
have
misspoke
on
that,
but
the
court--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--your
honor,
i
think
that
rix,
i
think
that
evans,
and
i
think
that
sutton
area
11
cases
where
the
claims
were
dismissed,
which
assist
us
in
this
case
and
indicate
the
kind
of
notice
that
is
required,
because
even
though--
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
however,
that's
in
effect
what
this
plaintiff
did.
he
wrote
this
memorandum
in
which
he
complained
about
his
treatment
by
the
company.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
is
universally
recognized
that
if
a
document
is
referred
to
and
relied
on
in
the
complaint,
it
is
regarded
as
being
incorporated
into
the
complaint,
and
it's
proper
for
the
court
to
look
at
it
on
a
12(b)(6)
motion.
ms.
lauren
r.
brody
thank
you.
