justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
petitioner,
a
53-year-old
native
of
hungary
filed
the
suit
against
respondent,
his
former
employer
alleging
that
he
had
been
fired
on
account
of
his
national
origin
in
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
and
on
account
of
his
age
in
violation
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
of
1967.
in
affirming
the
district
court’s
dismissal
of
the
complaint,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
its
settled
precedent
which
requires
an
employment
discrimination
complaint
to
alleged
facts
constituting
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
under
the
framework
set
forth
in
mcdonnell
douglas
versus
green.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
petitioner
had
failed
to
meet
this
burden
because
his
allegations
were
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
to
raise
an
inference
of
discrimination.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
an
employment
discrimination
complaint
need
not
contain
specific
facts
establishing
a
prima
facie
case
under
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework,
but
instead
must
contain
as
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
adea
requires
only
a
short
and
plain
statement
of
the
claim
showing
that
the
pleader
is
entitled
to
relief.
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework
is
an
evidentiary
standard
not
a
pleading
requirement.
the
second
circuit’s
heightened
pleadings
standard
for
employment
discrimination
cases
conflicts
with
rule
8(a)'s
expressed
language
which
requires
simply
that
the
complaint
give
the
defendant
notice
of
what
the
plaintiff’s
claim
is
and
the
grounds
upon
which
it
rests.
applying
this
standard,
petitioner’s
complaint
easily
satisfies
the
requirements
of
rule
8(a)
because
it
gives
respondent
fair
notice
of
the
basis
of
petitioner’s
claim.
in
addition,
the
complaints
states
claims
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted
under
title
vii
and
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act.
thus,
we
conclude
that
the
complaint
is
sufficient
to
survive
respondent’s
motion
to
dismiss.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
