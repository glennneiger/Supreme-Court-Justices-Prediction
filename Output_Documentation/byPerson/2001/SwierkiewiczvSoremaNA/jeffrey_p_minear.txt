mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
clearly
erred
in
ruling
that
the
pleadings,
in
this
case
the
complaint,
were
insufficient.
the
court's...
this
court's
ruling
in
conley
v.
gibson
makes
clear
that
notice
is
what's
essential
in
the
complaint.
in
this
case,
the
complaint
set
forth
a
short
and
plain
statement
of
the
claim,
and
it
indicated
a
request
for
relief.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
it
was.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
obviously
the
length
of
the
complaint
will
vary
on
the
degree
of
complexity
of
the
case,
but
i
think
that
simply
underscores
the
fact
that
this
complaint
was
more
than
ample
in
setting
forth
the
necessary
elements
of
a
complaint.
what's
important
about
the
complaint
in
this
case
is,
it
did
identify
both
the
adverse
action
that
was
involved
and
also
allege
that
the
adverse
action
was
the
product
of
a
prohibited
discrimination.
that
was
sufficient
to
put
the
employer
on
notice
of
the
basis
for
the
complaint,
and
provided
a
basis
for
relief
if
proved
at
trial.
the
federal
rules
do
not
require
that
a
party
include
additional
facts
that
go
beyond
this,
including
what
the
employer
calls
here
an
inference
of
discrimination.
rule
9
makes
clear
that
elements
of
conditions
of
mind,
for
instance,
can
be
averred
generally,
and
that
includes
matters
such
as
intent
and
motive,
and
the
federal
rules
certainly
do
not
require
that
the
parties
set
forth
all
the
elements
of
a
prima
facie
case
under
mcdonnell
douglas
v.
green.
as
petitioner's
counsel
has
pointed
out,
that
ruling
of
the
second
circuit
basically
confuses
the
requirements
for
pleading
a
complaint,
and
the
evidentiary
burdens
that
a
plaintiff
would
bear
at
trial
in
proving
a
disparate
treatment
case
in
a
situation
where
circumstantial
evidence
was
being
used.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
you
certainly
do
not
automatically--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--very
simply,
the
complaint
in
this
situation
presents
an
issue
of
fact.
was
there,
or
was
there
not
discrimination,
and
the
federal
rules
contemplated
the
mechanism
for
resolving
that
issue
was
summary
judgment.
in
this
case,
the
defendant's
counsel
is
free
to
bring
a
motion--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
may
be
that
a
complete
refusal
of
discovery
is
not
appropriate,
but
what's
important
here
is
that
rule
16,
which
deals
with
pretrial
conference,
coupled
with
rule
26,
regulating
discovery,
and
rule
56,
dealing
with--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
i
think
that
the
problem
the
second
circuit
discerned
is,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
it's
very
easy
to
allege
discrimination
and,
in
fact,
it
can
sometimes
be
very
difficult
to
prove
it
as
well.
the
federal
rules
deal
with
the
situation
by
providing
a
mechanism,
by
providing
a
procedure.
the
complaint
is
needed
to
put
the
parties
on
notice
of
what
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
no,
it
does
not,
and
in
fact
this
was
one
of
the
aims
of
the
advisory
committee
in
1938,
when
we
revised
the
rule,
to
get
away
from
the
code
practice
of
requiring
the
facts
of
the
cause
of
action
all
be
pleaded.
that
led
itself--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
exactly
right,
and
i
think
that
principle
is
clearly
enough
established
to
be
hornbook
law.
we
cite
a
selection
of
the
cases
that
deal
with
this
on
page
13
of
our
brief.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
if
i
can
break
down
this
question
and
answer
it
in
several
parts,
first
of
all
we
agree
it
may
well
have
been
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
have
considered
this
memorandum
rather
than
converting
the
motion
to
summary
judgment
where
questions
of
fact
and...
rather
than
having
to
take
all
the
inferences,
giving
all
of
the
inferences
to
the
plaintiff,
the
facts
could
be
waived
with
regard
to
the
meaning
of
that
memorandum.
we
think
that
if
the
memorandum
in
fact
provided
no
basis
for
this
suit
whatsoever
and
it
was
the
only
basis
on
which
the
plaintiff
had
premised
is
claim,
then
that
might,
in
fact,
be
fatal
to
the
complaint,
but
that's
not
the
situation
here
and,
in
fact,
there
are
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
that
memorandum,
such
as
the
reference
to
a
glass
ceiling,
that
could
be
read
favorably
to
the
plaintiff
to
support
his
cause
of
action.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
under
the
circumstances
of
considering
this
memorandum,
i
think
it
makes
it
very
difficult
not
being
included
in
discovery,
and
i
that
means
that
it
should
be
converted
to
a
summary
judgment
motion
under
rule
12(b)(6).
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that's
not,
strictly
speaking,
true
in
this
sense,
that
the
way
rule
56
is
structured
is
that
if
the
defendant
makes
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
the
plaintiff
is
under
an
obligation
to
come
forward
with
the
facts
sufficient
to
indicate
there's
a
triable
issue.
if
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
those
facts,
it
can
request
discovery
at
that
point.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
i
don't
think
it's
enough.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
the
benchmark
for
the
complaint
is
whether
it
provides
the
employer
fair
notice
of
the
action.
that's
how
the
complaint--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
that's
set
forth
in
rule
11,
and
that
requires
a
good
faith
belief--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
a
good
faith
belief
that
there
are
facts
to
support
the
action.
now,
it
may
often
be
the
case
that
the
facts
are
not--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
this
is
the
important
role
that
the
lawyer
and
the
officer
of
the
court
plays
in
policing
these
efforts.
the
lawyer
himself
must
make
an
investigation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i'm
not
sure
if
we
can
fine-tune
the
standard
here
to
that
degree.
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
these
facts,
these
issues
can
be
promptly
tested
through
summary
judgment,
and
summary
judgment
is
designed
to
deal
summarily
with
those
cases
which
are
not
substantial,
that
are
not
substantial.
there
may
be
a
requirement
of
some
level
of
discovery,
but
the
district
court,
who
is...
has
the
tools
available
to
structure
discovery,
can
limit
discovery
to
those
issues
that
are
in
fact...
provide
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--for
a
lawyer,
i
think
that
would
be
an
insufficient
basis
on
which
to
go
forward.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
continues
to
be
used,
your
honor.
thank
you.
