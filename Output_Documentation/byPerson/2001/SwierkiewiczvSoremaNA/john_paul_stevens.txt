justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
goodman,
may
i
ask
you
this
question:
is
one
of
the
things
the
district
judge
can
do,
is...
you
refer
on
page...
in
paragraph
31
of
the
complaint
to
a
particular
memorandum
which
your
client
sent
to
the
other
side,
and
the
other
side
filed
an
affidavit
saying,
here's
the
memorandum.
they
put
the
whole
memorandum
in.
may
the
judge
review
that
memorandum
and
take
it
into
account
in
ruling
on
the
motion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
you
did
give
notice
and
you
didn't
challenge
the
genuineness
of
the...
of
that
paper,
could
the
judge
look
at
it
in
deciding
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
instance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
assuming
the
judge
would
resolve
all
instances
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
if
the
judge
did
that,
could
the
judge
look
at
the
affidavit
in
ruling
on
the
motion
to...
i
mean,
look
at
the
paper
that's
referred
to
in
the
complaint
and
ruling
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
must
be
essential,
if
you
refer
to
it
in
your
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
in
paragraph
31
of
the
complaint,
they
refer
to
this
memorandum
as
outlining
the
plaintiff's
grievances
and
requesting...
outlining
grievances,
then
the
memorandum
was
put
into
the
record
by
the
defendant
and
the
judge
reviewed
the
memorandum
and
thought
it
didn't
really
show
any
discrimination.
he
said
at
oral
argument
plaintiff's
counsel
concedes
that
there's
nothing
in
the
memorandum
from
which
an
inference
of
age
or
national
origin
discrimination
can
be
made,
and
if
that
were
true,
would
that
provide
any
basis
for
a
12(b)(6)
motion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
minear,
what
is
the
status
in
today's
trial
where...
it's
a
long
time
ago,
but
we
used
to
make...
see
a
lot
of
complaints
where
facts
were
alleged
on
information
and
belief,
and
therefore
they
would
set
them
out
very
particularly
but
not
necessarily
conclusively,
but
i
don't
see
any
information
and
belief
allegations
in
this
complaint.
is
that
approach
used
today
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
right
at
the
outset,
because
i
want
to
get
to...
if
the
complaint
itself,
without
illumination
from
the
memorandum
that
you
put
in,
was
sufficient,
would
he
lose
because
you
create
a
different
atmosphere
from
looking
at
the
memorandum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
can
look
at
the
case
without
looking
at
the
memorandum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
31
is
not
enough
by
itself,
but
there
are
other
allegations
in
there
to
at
least
raise
an
inference,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
paragraph
37
alleges
plaintiff's
age
and
national
origin
were
motivating
factors
in
sorema's
decision
to
terminate
his
employment.
that's
pretty
direct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
was
held
to
be
time-barred
because
the
relevant
time
was
when
he
lost
his
seniority,
rather
than
when
he
was
terminated,
and
here
you're
arguing
that
the
only
evidence
of
discrimination
is
that
during
the
2
or
3
years
before
they
treated
the
french
employees
better
than
the
hungarian
employees,
and
it's
unreasonable
to
infer
from
that
that
the
discharge
was
similarly
motivated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
say
it
was,
and
so
there's
an
issue
of
fact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wasn't
because
the
allegations
weren't
sufficiently
detailed.
it
was
because
accepting
the
truth
of
all
the
details
set
forth
in
the
complaint,
it
didn't
state
what
the
court
regarded
as
a
violation
of
the
statutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
that
would
be
like
saying
in
this
case,
well,
even
if
he
were...
his
age
and
national
origin
were
motivating
factors
in
the
decision,
that
doesn't
violate
the
statute,
you
have
to
do
something
more,
and
i
suppose
maybe
you
could
argue
that,
that
motivation
isn't
enough,
it's
got
to
be
the
sole
cause,
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
plenty...
it
isn't...
the
sutton
case
was
not
an
absence
of
detail
in
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question,
as
having
studied
the
complaint
as
carefully
as
you
have?
do
you
interpret
the
charge
that
your
client
was
discriminating
against
this
person
because
he
was
hungarian,
or
because
he
was
not
french?
