justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
rule
16
conference
can
the
judge
say,
i've
looked
at
this
pleading,
and
it
passes
under
the
federal
rule,
but
i
think
discovery
would
be
expedited
if
you
made
it
much,
much
more
complete.
i
want
to
file
an
amended
complaint
setting
forth
the
allegations
and
the
reasons
for
your
injury
in
much
more
detail.
can
he
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
the
other
option
is
for
the
judge
to
allow
discovery
to
go
forward
but
on
a
limited
basis
and
keep
control
of
it
that
way?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
it
that...
how
would
you
describe
the
standard
that's
binding
on
the
plaintiff
and
his
attorney
for
firing
the
complaint,
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
question?
you
say,
you
know,
i
think
there
could
be
something
wrong
here.
i'd
like
to
discover.
is
that
enough?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
has
to
be
well-founded
suspicion.
is
there
some
verbal
formulation
that
floats
around
the
legal
world,
in
the
legal
world
that
helps
me?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
standard
of
confidence,
the
standard
of
belief
that
the
plaintiff
and
the
attorney
must
have
before
starting
the
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
good
faith
belief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
doesn't
he
have
to
investigate
the
state
of
mind
of
the
plaintiff
to
determine
is
bona
fides,
or
does
he...
is
there
some
objective
standard
implicit
in
the
good
faith,
there
have
to
be
some
objective
basis
for
the
good
faith
belief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
client
says,
you
know,
i
can
tell
by
looking
at
people
whether
they're
lying
or
not,
and
i
think
the
employer
lied
to
me.
i
just
can
tell.
