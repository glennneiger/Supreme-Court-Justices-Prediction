justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
deny
that
some
facts
have
to
be
stated,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
can
i
come
in
just
with
a
complaint
that
says,
i
have
been
unlawfully
discriminated
against
by
my
employer,
who
is...
and
i
name
the
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
contained
here?
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
gave
a
date.
it
gave
a
date,
too,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
goodman,
i
think
this
case
in
a
way
puts
notice
pleading
to
the
test.
in
the
form
complaint
that
you
referred
to
involving
an
automobile
accident,
you
know,
ordinarily
automobile
accidents
don't
happen
unless
there's
been
some
negligence
on
the
part
of
one
party
or
the
other,
but
you
get
hit
with
a
car,
and
you
know,
have
reason
to
suspect
there
was
some
negligence.
but
people
are
fired,
people
are
not
promoted
all
the
time,
without
any
necessary
implication
of
wrongdoing,
and
something
seems
wrong
that
when
you're
dismissed
you
can
say,
i
was
dismissed
because
i'm
a
hungarian,
without
having
any
evidence
whatever,
and
can
bring
a
complaint
and
then
use
the
courts
essentially
as
an
investigatory
arm
to
find
out
whether
you
indeed
do
have
any
basis
for
complaining.
i
think
it
just
seems--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
the
lawyer
must
know
something
more
than
the
mere
fact
that
i
was
fired,
and
i
think
i
was
fired
because
i
was
a
hungarian.
presumably
the
lawyer
has
to
ask
the
client,
why
do
you
think
you
were
fired
because
you
were
a
hungarian?
what
makes
you
think
that
was
the
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
you
can
tell
that
to
the
lawyer,
why
can't
you
put
it
in
the
complaint?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
some
of
it
must
be
known
to
the
plaintiff.
it's
just
not
enough
that
i'm
hungarian,
i'm
fired.
i
just
can't
come
into
a
lawyer
and
say,
sue
this
guy
because
i'm
hungarian
and
he
fired
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
think
he
fired
me
because
i'm
hungarian.
you
have
to
find
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
last
was
not
even
necessary.
that
to
the
last
was
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
have
to
allow
discovery
anyway
before
you
could
rule
under
12(b)(6),
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
exactly
what
i
meant,
that
you
couldn't
get
rid
of
the
case
on
the
basis
of
summary
judgment
without
allowing
discovery,
so
there's
basically
no
way
to
prevent
being
subjected
to
discovery
on
the
basis
of
a
claim
by
somebody
who
just
suspects,
with
no
reason
to
suspect,
that
he
has
been
fired
because
he's
hungarian.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
have
a
good
faith
belief
that
is
entirely
erroneous.
i
mean,
i
am
sure
that
i
was
fired
because
i'm
hungarian.
i
don't
know
a
single
fact,
but
by
god,
i
really
believe
that
there
are
some
facts.
is
that
enough...
and
he
conveys
that
to
his
lawyer.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
lacking
in
conley?
what
was
lacking?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
unfortunately
you
don't
have
any
in
which
we
find
a
complaint
insufficient
because
it
does
not
contain
that
detail.
i
mean,
that's
what
you
need.
i
mean,
you
might
well
say
all
these
cases
in
which
we've
approved
going
forward
with
the
litigation
stated
a
lot
more,
but
what
you
need
is
a
case
where
we
approved
granting
the
12(b)(6)
motion
because
there
was
not
enough
detail.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
hard
to
find.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait--
justice
antonin
scalia
those
elements
are
not
necessary
for...
to
win,
are
they?
they're
necessary
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case
that
would
insulate
you
against
a
preliminary
dismissal,
but
you
can
win
a
case
without
establishing
the
prima
facie
elements.
i
mean,
suppose
i
can't
show
that
i'm
a
member
of
a
protected
class,
but...
and
i
can't
show
that
other
people
were
fired,
but
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
this
employer
just
had
a
thing
against
white
male
anglo
saxons,
clearly
not
a
protected
class,
but
it
was
because...
and
i
have
evidence
that
will
prove
that,
that
i
was
fired
because
i
was
a
white
male
anglo
saxon,
and
this
employer
just
hated
white
male
anglo
saxons.
that's
a
valid
complaint,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
you're
arguing
this
case
as
though
it
is
an
essential...
it
is
essential
to
win
a
title
vii
claim
that
you
establish
a
prima
facie
case,
and
i
don't
think
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
you
have
other
manners
of
establishing
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
those
are
questions
of
fact
which
need
not
be
pleaded.
those
are
the
evidentiary
proof.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
case
are
you
referring
to
now?
