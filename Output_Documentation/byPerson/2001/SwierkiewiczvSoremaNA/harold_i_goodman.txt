mr.
harold
i.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
brings
up
for
review
a
fairly
straightforward
but
nonetheless
essential
question
as
it
applies
to
federal
practice
and
procedure,
namely,
whether
or
not
notice
pleading
is
sufficient
with
compliance
with
rule
8(a)(2),
or
whether
or
not
the
rule
requires
some
element
of
fact
pleading
to
overcome
a
rule
12(b)(6)
motion
to
dismiss.
it
arises
in
the
context
of
a
title
vii
national
origin
and
an
age
discrimination
case
under
the
adea.
mr.
swierkiewicz
was
fired
from
his
job
by
sorema,
his
former
employer.
he
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
claiming
that
that
firing
was
based
upon
his
national
origin...
he's
hungarian...
and
his
age.
he
was
about
51
at
the
time.
he
pled
that
there
was
no
valid
reason
for
his
discharge.
he
pointed
to
the
fact
that
he
himself
had
incurred
a
history
over
2
years
of
discrimination
based
on
his
national
origin
and
his
age,
coming
from
1995,
when
he
was
demoted
from
his
position
as
chief
underwriting
officer,
through
and
including
two
successive
years
where
he
was
the
victim
of
continuous
discrimination
by
being
excluded
from
meetings,
business
decisions,
and
isolated
and
denied
any
career
growth.
the
second
circuit,
affirming
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
concluded
that
conclusory
allegations
of
discrimination,
what
it
referred
to
as
naked
allegations,
were
insufficient.
some
facts
had
to
be
proved,
proved
via
a
complaint,
because
it
adopted
as
a
pleading
standard
this
court's
elements
of
a
prima
facie
case
in
mcdonnell
douglas
v.
green.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
i
do
not.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
i
think
if
you
did
not
identify
the
adverse
action,
there
would
not
be
sufficient
information
alleged
to
be
able
to
sustain
a
motion
for
dismissal.
however,
even
in
that--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--absolutely.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
absolutely.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
five
times
in
the
complaint.
five
times,
so
that
while
i
absolutely
agree
that
sufficient
information
must
be
pled,
a)
to
put
a
defendant
on
notice,
what
is
this
claim
all
about,
so
i
can
begin
the
investigative
work
of
defending
it
and
responding
via
a
responsive
pleading,
and
ultimately
so
that
the
case
can
have
res
judicata
effect
so
that
we
know
what
the
claim
is
that
normally,
as
this
court's
precedents
unanimously
and
consistently
have
said,
notice
pleading,
and
more
particularly,
simplified
notice
pleading
is
more
than
enough.
so
we
contrast
what
the
second
circuit
did
with
three
critical
barometers.
the
first
and
most
critical
are
these
court's
precedents,
starting,
of
course,
with
conley
in
1957,
a
case
brought
under
the
railway
labor
act
claiming
that
the
union
did
not
fairly
represent
the
interests
of
african
american
conductors
and
porters.
as
justice
black,
writing
for
the
court,
said,
the
allegations
were
entirely
general,
but
in
response
to
the
union's
argument
that
more
specificity,
some
specificity
had
to
be
alleged,
the
court
wrote,
the
law
requires
unions
to
represent
minorities
on
the
same
basis
as
nonminorities.
that--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--dioguardi
is
my
favorite
case,
simply
because
it
has
been
authored
by
then
judge
and
later
chief
judge
clark,
who
was
the
reporter
for
this
court's
advisory
committee.
it
was
decided
in
1944,
and
the
argument
the
government
made
in
opposition
to
the
complaint,
which
was
a
pro
se
complaint,
was
simply
that
some
facts
had
to
be
alleged
to
support
the
plaintiff's
claims
that
the
government
a)
had
undersold
his
medicinal
tonic,
and
b)
had
lost
two
cases
of
his
medicinal
tonic,
to
which
judge
clark
said,
no,
the
time
for
ascertaining
the
facts
under
the
new
federal
system,
then
6
years
old,
was
through
discovery,
and
if
the
case
was
nonmeritorious,
through
summary
judgment,
but
it's
enough
that
this
pro
se
litigant
simply
said,
you
deprived
me
of
my
goods,
you
undersold
my
property.
that
is
the
leading
case
and,
indeed,
in
conley--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--well--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--i
do,
indeed.
i
do,
indeed,
and
that's
why
i
started
with
conley,
but
it
is
interesting
and,
i
think,
prophetic,
that
footnote
5
of
conley
cites
dioguardi
with
approval.
now,
in
conley
the
court
rebuffed
unanimously
the
claim
that
some
specificity
had
to
be
embossed
upon
the
complaint.
17
years
later,
in
scheuer,
again
a
unanimous
court
then
through
chief
justice
burger
rebuffed
claims
by
ohio
that
the
national
guard
and
the
governor
of
ohio,
who
were
defendants,
were
sued
on
a
1983
damage
claim
with
only
the
bare
allegation
that
the
national
guard
had
done
wrong
and
was
responsible
for
the
deaths
of
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case,
rebuffing
unanimously
the
argument
that
some
facts
had
be
pled.
the
court
turned
aside
that
holding
and
that
case
of
the
sixth
circuit
and,
indeed,
said,
you
do
not
need
to
do
it
in
a
complaint.
notice
pleading,
as
we
pointed
out
in
conley,
is
more
than
sufficient.
you
will
have
sufficient
time
to
flesh
out
issues,
to
learn
facts
in
discovery.
had
that
been
the
end
of
the
trilogy,
it
would
have
been
enough,
but,
as
this
court
knows,
just
9
years
ago,
8
years
ago,
in
1993
in
leatherman,
again
confronted
with
a
similar
issue
in
a
1983
municipal
liability
case,
the
court
had
to
decide
whether
or
not
some
facts
were
essential
to
a
1983
failure-to-train
case
under
canton.
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit,
which
was
accepted
on
review,
had
said
in
no
uncertain
terms
the
complaint
here
alleges
no
facts,
none,
to
support
the
failure-to-train
case.
in
response,
the
court,
through
the
chief
justice,
unanimously
said
no.
we
meant
what
we
said
in
conley.
rule
8(a)(2)
is
sufficient
if
a
plaintiff
provides
information
that
puts
a
defendant
on
notice
of
the
claims.
that's
all
that's
required.
if,
today,
we
had
to
revise
the
rules
there
is
a
process
for
doing
that
and
that
might
result,
for
1983
purposes,
in
a
revision
to
rule
8(a)(2)
such
as
that
9(a)(2),
which
now
only
requires
particularity
in
cases
of
fraud
and
mistake,
might
have
a
third
entry
for
particularity
purposes,
a
1983
action,
for
example,
or
here.
if,
upon
proper
review
and
the
process
of
this
court's
committee
and
its
adoption
of
rules
and
those
by
congress,
it
was
felt
that
a
title
vii
case
or
an
age
case
ought
to
also
require
particularity,
that
would
be
the
time
and
that
would
be
the
place
to
do
it.
but
i
submit
that
there
are
two
substantial
other
reasons
for
reversal
here,
and
they
are
bedded
in
the
federal
rules
and
have
not
changed
in
six
decades,
and
they
emanate
from
rule
84,
the
rule,
scarcely
utilized,
but
is
important
in
this
case,
which
simply
says
the
forms,
the
official
forms
that
are
attached
to
the
rules,
are
sufficient
for
federal
pleading.

rule

gives
the
district
court
considerable
discretion
to
isolate
issues,
to
isolate
discovery.

example,
a
rix-type
defense
was
raised,
which
isn't
true
in

case,

to
isolate

allow

and
allow

to
follow
on
that
issue.
if
it's
granted,
the
case
is
over.
if
it's
denied,
the
case
proceeds
on
full
merits.
there
are
numerous

of

that
district
courts
have
to
both
curtail--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--uh...
excuse
me.
not
in
the
context,
i
think,
of
this
case,
for
two
reasons.
one,
it
was
an
ex
parte
submission.
the
affidavit
of
defense
counsel
says,
i
received
a
request
from
the
district
court.
plaintiff
was
never
notified
of
it.
i
thought
it
was
odd
that
it
was
made
of
defense
counsel,
so
there
was
no--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--i
think
in
some
instances,
yes,
but
not--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--not
in
this,
because
it
raises
all
sorts
of
questions
of
credibility
and
inference.
mr.
swierkiewicz,
for
example,
referred
to
a
hostile
work
environment.
he
work...
he
indicated--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--i
think
so.
i
think
so.
i
think
it
depends,
though,
on
the
substance
of
the
document.
i'm
assuming
that
authenticity,
for
example,
is
not
in
dispute.
i'm
assuming
that
all
inferences
in
the
document
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
are
going
to
be
accorded
to
the
plaintiff
and
not
to
the
defendant.
assuming
that,
and
also
assuming
that
the
underlying
document
is
essential
to
the
case,
then,
i
think,
under
the
case
law
it
may
be
considered
by
the
district
court.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
yes.
that's
why
i
answered
the
question
yes.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
i
think
it
is
permissible,
but
largely
an
abuse
of
discretion
if
the
court
has
stated,
which
was
implicit
or
explicit,
justice
kennedy,
in
your
question,
that
the
complaint
satisfies
rule
8(a)(2).
if
the
complaint
were
deemed
so
vague
and
ambiguous,
to
quote
precisely
rule
12(e),
a
defendant
could
make
that
motion
to
flush
out
much
more
factual,
or
more
information,
or
regarding
either
liability
or
damages,
but
i
would
say
except
in
the
most
egregious
case
a
sua
sponte
direction
by
a
district
court
who
has
said,
it
is
my
view
that
your
complaint
satisfies
8(a)(2),
it
would
be
precisely
what
rule
8(a)(2)
and
the
simplified
notice
pleading
requirements
were
intended
to
avoid,
which
was
a
lot
of
litigation
up
front
to
avoid
a
disposition
on
the
merits.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
absolutely
and,
of
course,
the
revisions
to
the
rules,
both
in
terms,
for
example,
of
the
number
of
interrogatories,
the
number
of
depositions,
have
gone
a
considerable
way
towards
that
effect
in
any
event,
but
the
district
court
has
considerable
latitude
to
add
to
that.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
i
think
there
are
two
responses
to
that.
first
of
all,
if
the
complaint
is
frivolous
or
bought
in
bad
faith,
as
an
officer
of
the
court
the
plaintiff's
law
him
or
herself
would
be
exposed
to
damages,
so
there's
got
to
be
some
sort
of
good
faith
at
the
outset
in
making
that
kind
of
allegation.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
i
think
you're--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--the
question
is
whether
or
not
you
must
put
it
in
the
complaint,
and
for
purposes
of
this
court's
precedents,
and
again
i
come
back
to
conley
and
scheuer
and
leatherman,
the
only
way
that
they
must
be
put
in
the
case,
with
all
due
respect,
is
if
rule
8(a)(2)
were
amended,
or
rule
9(b)
were
amended,
and
if--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--exactly,
and
that
was
my
last
point,
and
i'll
end
with
it,
and
that
is
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
here
in
effect
conflated
elements
of
evidence
with
elements
of
pleading.
mcdonnell
douglas
v.
green
was
a
recognition
of
what
we
all
know
to
be
true.
employers
do
not
look
you
in
the
eye
and
say
you're
too
old,
i'm
firing
you,
you're
hungarian,
you
are
black,
you
are
a
woman,
you
are
disabled.
it
doesn't
work
that
way.
that's
what
mcdonnell
douglas
did.
it
said,
we
can
find
an
indirect
way,
circumstantially,
to
come
to
the
same
result.
this
is
what
a
plaintiff
needs
do
to
overcome
summary
judgment
or
to
prevail
at
trial.
the
second
circuit,
unlike
every
circuit
that
has
considered
the
issue,
namely,
the
d.c.,
the
third,
the
sixth,
the
seventh,
the
eighth,
and
the
ninth,
made
you
put
the
evidence
at
the
outset
of
the
case
and
if
i
might,
justice
scalia,
much
of
that
evidence
is
not
known
to
the
plaintiff
at
the
outset.
as
this
court
has
held
just
last
term
in
reeves,
the
key
to
the
evidence
frequently
is
in
the
hands
of
the
defendant:
who
replaced
mr.
swierkiewicz?
why
was
he
fired
instantly,
on
the
spot?
who
made
that
decision?
you
need
discovery
for
that.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
and
this
complaint
pleads
far
more
than
that.
this
complaint
pleads
2
years
of
ongoing
continuous
discrimination
based
on
national
origin
and
based
on
age.
now,
i
would
say
that
if
it
said
i
was
fired
because
i'm
hungarian,
because
i'm
51,
gives
the
date
in
april
1997,
identifies
the
individual
who
fired
him,
francois
chavel,
identifies
five
other
people
who
were
fired
for
cause
and
got
substantial
severance
benefits,
that
that
satisfied
any
kind
of
notice
pleading
ever
set
up
by
this
court.
we
did
more
than
we
had
to.
for
those
reasons--
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
--correct.
for
those
reasons
we
respectfully
request
the
court
to
reverse.
thank
you.
mr.
harold
i.
goodman
just
to
follow
up
on
justice
ginsburg's
comment
about
mcdonald,
on
the
very
point
raised,
the
complaint
was
sustained
and
not
denied.
at
427
u.s.
283,
footnote
11,
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
requirement
for
particularity
as
defendant
had
requested,
and
thus
sustained
the
complaint.
second,
and
last,
in
1953
the
ninth
circuit
recommended
to
the
advisory
committee
that
rule
8,
too,
be
amended
to
add
this
phrase
at
the
end,
namely
the
statement
in
the
complaint
shall
contain
facts
constituting
a
cause
of
action.
in
1955,
the
court's
advisory
committee
rejected
it.
it
said
that
it
only
requires
a
general
statement.
thank
you.
