ms.
claudia
center
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
ms.
claudia
center
that's
correct.
ms.
claudia
center
the
may
include
relates
to
the
case
by
case
individualized
analysis
that
must
take
place.
ms.
claudia
center
well,
i
think
there
are
several
reasons
that
the
ag-
the
agency,
the
eeoc
has
come
to
that
conclusion,
which
i
agree
with.
ms.
claudia
center
further,
the
eeoc
regulations
explain
that
the
purpose
of
the
reasonable
accommodation
is
to
enable
the
disabled
employee
to
enjoy
the
privileges
of
employment
along
with
similarly
situated
disa-
nondisabled
employees,
to
enjoy
equal
benefits,
and
if
there's
a
promotion
it's
sort
of
it's
contrary
to
that...
ms.
claudia
center
well,
in
this
case
the
job
that
mr.
barnett
ended
up
with
was
equal
in
terms
of,
a
he
would
have
he
would
have
been
employed,
and
b
at
the
same
pay
and,
et
cetera,
the
same
level...
ms.
claudia
center
have
gotten
but
for
his
disability.
ms.
claudia
center
right,
the
accommodation
is...
ms.
claudia
center
well,
it's
in
addition
to
the
con-
the
reasons
i
already
gave
you,
the
agency
has
construed
reassignment
to
a
vacant
position
to
not
include
promotion,
ms.
claudia
center
in
this
case,
though,
the
accommodation
that
mr.
barnett
sought
was
not
more
seniority.
ms.
claudia
center
an
accommodation...
ms.
claudia
center
it's
not
cut
loose
from
the
disability.
ms.
claudia
center
well,
i
think
that
he...
ms.
claudia
center
well,
there
are
actu-
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
that
reasonable
accommodation
if
all
other
possibilities
are
exhausted.
ms.
claudia
center
yes.
ms.
claudia
center
no,
it's
not
a
promotion.
ms.
claudia
center
no,
i'm
i
think
that
the
employer
is
free
to
try
and
present
a
defense
to
our
claim
of
failure
to
accommodate.
ms.
claudia
center
there
would
be
a
jury.
ms.
claudia
center
yes,
there
was
a
challenge
to
that
description.
ms.
claudia
center
well,
there
wasn't
a
a
maybe
i
misunderstood
the
question
but
there
was
in
the
record
an
effort
to
point
out
that
they
had
made
exceptions
to
the
seniority
system,
ms.
claudia
center
there
are
additional
facts,
in
addit-
in
addition
to
the
catastrophic
illness
exception
there
is
a
significant
modification
to
how
to
calculate
furlough
seniority.
ms.
claudia
center
and
the
grievance
procedure,
whereby
employees
would
bring
these
seniority
matters
to
the
company's
attention,
that
grievance
procedure
says,
you're
not
allowed
to
grieve
something
that's
required
by
federal
law.
ms.
claudia
center
the
sort
of
domino
effect
has
been
vastly
overstated
in
this
case
by
the
petitioner.
ms.
claudia
center
right,
but
in
terms
of
the
particular
chain,
there's
a
list
of
jobs
upon
which
the
nondisabled
employees
can
bid.
ms.
claudia
center
someone
may
get
a
job
that
they
would
a
job
where
they
would
have
preferred
another...
ms.
claudia
center
that's
correct,
but
no
one
would
lose
their
job...
ms.
claudia
center
well,
you
could
conclude
that,
but
i
think
it's
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
structure,
if
you
looked
at
the
list
of
reasonable
accommodations,
if
you
look
at
the
governing
regulations,
all
of
these
provisions
explain
how
the
equities
are
weighed...
ms.
claudia
center
well,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
requires
that
the
employer
provide
reasonable
accommodation.
ms.
claudia
center
well,
if
you
disagree
with
our
reading
of
the
term,
reasonable
accommodation,
the
term
st-
still
would
require
a
case-by-case
individualized
analysis
of
whether
it
was
reasonable
in
this
situation,
and
what
the
petitioner
wants
is
a
per
se
rule
for
bona
fide
seniority
policies.
ms.
claudia
center
i
think
that
each
of
the
handicapped
employees
would
be
entitled
to
reassignment
to
a
vacant
position.
ms.
claudia
center
well
i
think,
then,
that
the
the
client
would
be
the
mo-
more
disabled
individual
would
be
entitled
to
reassignment.
ms.
claudia
center
there
could
be
conflicting
requests
for
accommodation,
that's...
ms.
claudia
center
there
would
be
a
number
of...
ms.
claudia
center
i
don't
believe
that
the
more
disabled
employee
would
be
entitled
to
bump
the
less-disabled
employee.
ms.
claudia
center
why?
because
th-
the
employee
that
i-
needs
the
accommodation
continues
to
need
the
accommodation.
ms.
claudia
center
excuse
me.
ms.
claudia
center
that's
correct.
ms.
claudia
center
but
the
argument
is
that
there's
a
federal
law
in
this
case
that
requires
reasonable
accommodation,
including
reassignment.
ms.
claudia
center
he
has
a
back
impair-
back
impairment.
ms.
claudia
center
he
has
an
orthopedic
disability.
ms.
claudia
center
it's
disputed.
ms.
claudia
center
could
you
ask
it
one
more
time?
i'm
sorry.
ms.
claudia
center
that's
correct.
ms.
claudia
center
that's
correct.
ms.
claudia
center
well,
it's
true
that
in
certain
cases,
providing
the
reassignment
to
the
vacant
position
ends
up
giving
a
priority
to
the
disabled
employee
over
a
nondisabled
employee.
ms.
claudia
center
and
if
you
do
decide
that
reasonable
takes
into
account
other
employees,
in
this
case
the
equities
really
favor
mr.
barnett,
because
mr.
barnett
is
the
one
that
faced
job
loss.
ms.
claudia
center
if
you
pulled
out
reasonable?
ms.
claudia
center
well,
if
you
pulled
out
reasonable
in
that
way,
i
s-
think
there'd
be
a
difficulty
arguing
it
would
be
reasonable
to
disrupt
another
effective
accommodation
that's
already
in
place.
ms.
claudia
center
well,
i
think
that
the
disruption,
as
we
state
in
our
brief,
can
be
considered
in
the
undue
hardship
defense.
ms.
claudia
center
no.
ms.
claudia
center
because
i
think
that's
contrary
to
the
structure
of
the
statute.
ms.
claudia
center
perhaps
i'm
still
misunderstanding,
but
i
was
answering
the
question
assuming
that
m-
my
reading
of
the
statute
was
rejected
and
that
we
were
looking
at
equities
in
the
word...
ms.
claudia
center
yes.
ms.
claudia
center
that's
correct.
ms.
claudia
center
that's
correct.
ms.
claudia
center
no.
ms.
claudia
center
that's
correct.
ms.
claudia
center
well,
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
items
in
the
record
that
show
that
the
actual
disruption
to
the
employer,
as
well
as
the
impact
on
other
employees,
would
have
been
extremely
modest,
and
that
retaining
mr.
barnett
in
the
job
he'd
been
successfully
performing
for
years
was
would
have
been
an
entirely
reasonable
accommodation,
if
you
want
to
pull
out
reasonable.
ms.
claudia
center
well,
that's
true,
and
there's
certainly
sufficient
evidence
under
reeves
for
our
client
to
have
a
trial
on
that
issue,
