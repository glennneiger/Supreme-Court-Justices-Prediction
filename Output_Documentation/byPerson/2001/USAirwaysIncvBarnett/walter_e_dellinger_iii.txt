mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
title
one
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
does
more
than
merely
prohibit
hostile
discrimination
against
individuals
wi-
with
disabilities.
congress
recognized
that
an
additional
kind
of
discrimination
is
the
failure
of
employers
through
indifference
or
whatever
to
undertake
reasonable
accommodations
to
the
physical
or
mental
limitations
of
otherwise
qualified
individuals.
as
a
result,
this
act
does
affirmatively
require
businesses
to
lift
barriers
that
inhibit
employment
opportunities
for
those
with
disabilities.
the
question
here,
though,
is
whether,
in
one
particular
respect,
the
act
goes
beyond
a
requirement
that
obstacles
be
cleared
away.
the
issue
is
this.
where
an
employee
is
unable,
because
of
a
disability,
to
continue
in
his
job,
is
that
employee
entitled
to
be
placed
in
another
position
instead
of
a
more
senior
fellow
employee
who
would
be
entitled
to
the
job
under
the
normal
operation
of
a
bona
fide
seniority
system?
now,
this
is
not
an
easy
question
wha-
but
we
believe
that
in
the
end
a
clear
answer
necessarily
emerges
from
the
act.
and
that
is
this,
that
the
act
simply
does
not
require
an
employer
to
override
neutral
selection
criteria
wholly
unrelated
to
disability
in
choosing
among
applicants
for
a
position.
and
in
particular
it
does
not
require
the
employer
to
set
aside
the
normal
operation
of
a
bona
fide
seniority
system.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
in
fact,
i
think
the
presence
of
that
provision
in
title
seven
is
part
of
a
background
assumption
in
which
neither
title
seven
nor
any
other
civil
rights
act
has
ever
taken
what
would
be
a
fairly
substantial
step
of
requiring
an
employer
to
prefer
someone
for
a
position
over
an
employee
who
is
entitled
to
it
under
a
seniority
system
or,
indeed,
to
prefer
any
applicant...
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
over
a
more
qualified
employee.
but
your
answer
is
that
it...
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
title
seven
took
especial
care
to
do
that,
but
if
you
look
at
the
more
relevant
statute,
the
rehabilitation
act,
it
also
does
not
contain
any
express
exception.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
it
does,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
that
terminology
is
not
used,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
all
through
the
entire
category
of
customer
service
employees,
which
would
be
fourteen
thousand.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that's
right.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no,
there
is
no
there's
no
i-
i-
if
you
gained
the
impression
from
respondent's
brief
that
mr.
barnett's
position
was
somehow
singled
out
to
be
declared
vacant.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
and
i'm
glad
you
asked
that.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct,
and
we
believe
that
what
that
means,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
an
employer
must,
unlike
the
situation
under
the
rehabilitation
act,
where
you
could
simply
say
you
can't
do
the
job,
we're
letting
you
go,
we
can't
accommodate
that
job,
they
have
no
obligation
to
consider
other
places
in
the
company.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
you
are
exactly
right
that
when
the
quarterly
rebidding
process
comes
up,
yes,
they
have
to
consider,
and
they
did,
indeed,
consider
mr.
barnett's
request
to
be
transferred
into
that
position.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
mean
good
in
the
sense
that
it
has
to
be
a
legitimate,
bona
fide...
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
where
you
have
a
seniority
system
that
is
riddled
with
exceptions,
it
is
perfectly
open
to
someone
who
challenges
that
to
say,
you
don't
really
have
a
neutral
policy
unrelated
to...
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
no.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
le-
let
me
preface
my
answer
by
saying
that
for
decades
us
airways
has
had
an
established
seniority
policy
that
covers
all
of
these
positions,
which
has
been
regularly
followed,
with
one
exception
for
catastrophic
illnesses
and
one
revision
of
how
you
calculate
the
time
of
seniority,
so
that
that
issue
is
not,
you
know,
raised
or
put
before
the
court
as
to
whether
you
would
think
that
not
a
good
reason.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
let
me
acknowledge
that
what
makes
this
an
interesting
case
is
the
fact
tha-
that
the
ada
does
go
beyond
merely
pro-
prohibiting
hostile
discrimination.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
did
not
have
in
it
the
word,
reassignment.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
how
i
read
that
brief.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
what
reasonable
accommodation...
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
undue
hardship,
that's
right,
really
goes
to
the
cost
on
an
employer.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
it
is
unreasonable
for
the
following
reason.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
souter,
that
is
a
good
question
that
i
think
would
go
to
you
know
whether
it
was
an
undue
hardship.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
but
here,
on
the
question
of
unreasonableness,
i
think
we're
looking
at
a
question
of
principle.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
and
even
even
though
we
don't
know
the
numbers,
because
we
don't
know
of
ultimately
how
broadly
the
court
will
interpret
the
phrase,
disability,
which
you
have
sub
judice
in
other
cases,
and
even
then
would
take
some
working
out.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
there
could
well
be.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
we
don't
know
what
the
consequences
will
be,
because
what
what
mr.
barnett
is
asking
and
this
is
from
his
declaration,
which
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
is
at
page
three
of
his
declaration
of
february
twenty-weigh-
twenty-eighth.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
think
we
don't
know
that,
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
because
it
could
well
be
that
the
more
senior
employee
who
needs
to
be
in
the
mailroom,
because
she
needs
ki-
her
position
is
being
eliminated.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
may
well
be
in
many
instances
the
bottom-most
person
will
lose
their
job.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
under
our
plan,
it
won't
be
that
more
people
will
lose
jobs,
or
get
their
less
desired
accommodation.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
when
it
comes
to
filling
positions,
which
is
fundamentally
different,
i
think,
than
adding
other
elements.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
thank
you.
