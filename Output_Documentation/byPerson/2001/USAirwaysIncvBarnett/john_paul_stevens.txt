justice
john
paul
stevens
ask,
do
you
mean
any
neutral
any
neutral
selection
criteria
would
trump
the
statute?
say
they
had
a
criteria
that
they
used
brand
new
employees
for
certain
ticket-selling
jobs
as
a
training
mechanism,
and
they
always
took
people
who
hadn't
worked
for
the
company
for
more
than
ninety
days
or
something,
but
that
was
their
regular
pra-
practice,
would
that
practice
always
trump
the
interest
of
the
disability
disabled
person?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
you've
added
the
word
good.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
let
me
be
sure
of
one
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
about
a
hypothetical
that's
running
running
through
my
mind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
theoretically
possible
that
the
he
is
because
of
his
disability,
he's
leaving
a
job
that
is
a
very
attractive
job
for
a
nondisabled
person.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
misunderstand?
so
i
thought
you
had
agreed
earlier
that
it
would
never
be
reasonable
to
bump
another
employee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
