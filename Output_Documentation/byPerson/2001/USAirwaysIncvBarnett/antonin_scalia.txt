why
is
it
it
has
been
conceded,
i
i
gather
you
didn't
contest
this
anyway,
in
your
in
your
in
your
brief,
that
reasonable
accommodation
would
never
include
appointment
to

a
promotion
to
a

a
position
that
pays

more,
even
though
the
amount
it
pays
more
is
negligible.

well,
but
th-
th-
this
is
a
vacant
higher
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
is
what
you're
urging
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
you
you
can't
urge
that
your
system
assures
that
that
the
disabled
not
be
given
any
benefits
that
other
employees
would
not
would
not
get.

criterion.
justice

never

the

talking
about
him,
though.
justice
antonin

once
you
once
you
cut
it
loose
from
accommodating
the
disability,
which
is
which
is
what
the
other
side
wants
to
do,
once
you
cut
it
loose
from
that,
why
why
isn't
everything
up
for
grabs,
including
a
promotion?
justice

i

it
depends.

of
them
that
shows
that
congress
envisioned
not
just
putting
some
burden
on
the
employer,
but
putting
some
burden
on
fellow
employees?
justice
antonin
scalia
mentions
vacancy
only
i
mean,
it
mentions
vacancy
because
nobody's
nobody's
hurt
if
there's
a
vacancy.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
preferring
one
to
i
mean,
giving
someone
an
adv-
a
benefit
that
someone
else
doesn't
get,
such
as
allowing
them
to
do
a
certain
job
sitting
down
when
everybody
else
has
to
do
it
standing
up,
or
what-not,
that
doesn't
disadvantage
the
others.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
reason
you
can't
bump
another
employee
is
that
that's
unreasonable,
is
that...
