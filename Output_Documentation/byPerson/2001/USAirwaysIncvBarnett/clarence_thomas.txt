say
that
your
client
could
be
bumped
by
someone
who's
more
severely
handicapped
if
he
were
in
that
position?
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
but
i
it's
my
understanding
that
these
positions
are
deemed
open
at
some
point.
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
not
that's
i
think
you've
missed
my
point.
justice
clarence
thomas
person
be
entitled
to
that
position...
justice
clarence
thomas
your
argument?
justice
clarence
thomas
but
you
could
say
that
about
the
people
who
have
the
job
inst-
in
the
first
instance,
couldn't
you?
justice
clarence
thomas
the
person
who
had
that
position
and
had
his
or
her
life
worked
out,
day
care,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
also
needed
that
position.
justice
clarence
thomas
so
the
argument's
the
same.
justice
clarence
thomas
let
me
ask
you
this.
justice
clarence
thomas
what
does
that
mean?
justice
clarence
thomas
i
hate
to
belabor
the
point,
ms.
center,
but
the
more
disabled
employee,
someone
who's
severely
disabled,
if
that
person
has
to
be
accommodated
and
we
only
have
has
have
to
look
at
that
person's
needs
in
making
our
reasonableness
determination,
i
don't
understand
why
your
client
can't
be
bumped
if
he
were
in
that
position.
justice
clarence
thomas
and
only
and
you
limited
that
determination
to
th-
the
disabled
person
who
has
to
be
accommodated.
justice
clarence
thomas
but
that's
then
your
argument
is
only
different
in
slightly
from
the
argument
that
you
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
disruption
that's
caused
in
others'
lives
when
you
disrupt
the
seniority
system.
justice
clarence
thomas
consider
the
disruption
to
your
client
in
the
undue
hardship
category?
