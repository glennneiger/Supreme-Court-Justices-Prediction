suppose
you

a

system
that's

exceptions.
justice

you
do.

all
right,
then
at
that
point
i'd
become
uncertain
what
exactly
wh-
wh-
why
we
should
hold
what
you
want,
that
from
my
point
of
view.
justice
stephen

breyer
i
didn't
see
it.
justice
stephen

could
tell,
what
i
have
to
assume
about
the
system
is
that
it's
widespread.

justic-
for

purposes,
i
take
those
as

given
that
statement,
to
get
to
this
what
i
think
of
anyway
as
the
heart
of
this
matter,
assuming
i
don't
accept
your

of

justice

that
part
of
your
answer,
though
i
want
to
hear
the
rest,
because
if
there
are
seven

jobs
missing,
then
it
will
be
seven

people
at
the

without
a

justice
stephen

yes,
but
if
i
reject
that
view
of
the
statute
on
on
the
one
i
was
taking,
i'd
still
like
to
know
what
the
response
is
to
what
i

is
the
main

which
is
not
the

i
look

the
americans
with
disabilities
act
prohibits
an
employer
from
discriminating
against
an
“individual
with
a
disability"
who
with
“reasonable
accommodation"
can
perform
the
essential
functions
of
the
job.
this
case
asks
as
to
reconcile
a
conflict
that
can
rise
between
on
the
one
hand
the
need
of
a
disabled
worker
for
an
accommodation
that
takes
the
form
of
an
assignment
to
another
position
in
different
job
in
the
company,
and
on
the
other
hand,
employees
who
hold
superior
rights
to
bid
for
that
very
job
under
an
employer's
system
of
seniority.
this
case
arises
in
the
context
of
summary
judgment.
the
conflict
is
who
gets
the
job,
the
worker
with
a
disability
or
the
worker
who
has
the
seniority.
in
our
efforts
to
resolve
this
potential
conflict
which
is
complicated,
we
reached
five
significant
legal
conclusions
and
i
will
simply
say
what
the
conclusions
are:
first,
we
conclude
that
the
word
reasonable
in
the
context
of
reasonable
accommodation
does
not
have
a
special
technical
meaning
rather
congress
intended
that
word
to
carry
the
meaning
that
it
has
in
ordinary
english;
second,
the
act
may
sometimes
require
an
employer
in
order
to
accommodate
the
needs
of
an
individual
with
a
disability
to
violate
and
otherwise
disability
neutral
workplace
rule
for
example,
maybe
the
employee
who
has
the
disability
would
need
more
work
breaks
then
the
employer’s
neutral
rules
would
otherwise
allow.
now
the
acts
basic
equal
opportunity
goal
may
require
the
employer
to
give
in
that
sense
the
employee
a
preference
where
special
treatment
is
needed
to
accommodate
the
disability
and
in
the
circumstances
providing
that
preference
is
a
reasonable
thing
to
do.
third,
we
note
the
difficulty
that
courts
have
had
and
they
have
had
considerable
difficulty.
i
am
trying
to
reconcile
two
phrases
in
this
statute:
the
one
seems
to
say
that
the
plaintiff
has
approved
that
the
accommodation
that,
say,
she
needs
is
reasonable,
and
the
other
seems
to
require
an
employer
to
prove
that
an
accommodation
is
nonetheless
not
required
because
it
will
work
“an
undue
hardship"
upon
the
business.
so,
what
is
the
relation
of
these
two
words,
reasonable
accommodation,
and
undue
hardship
on
the
business.?
we
have
reconciled
those
two
phrases
in
the
same
way
that
most
lower
courts
have
reconciled.
the
plaintiff
who
is
an
employee
with
the
disability
has
to
show
that
the
proposed
accommodation
seems
reasonable
on
its
face
that
is
that
it
would
ordinarily
be
reasonable,
it
would
be
reasonable
in
the
run
of
cases.
now,
once
the
plaintiff
has
shown
that
then
the
defendant
who
is
likely
the
employer
has
to
show
special
and
typically
there
are
case
specific
circumstances
that
show
that
in
this
case,
whatever
is
true
in
general
there
will
be
undue
hardship.
fourth,
applying
this
rule
we
conclude
that
the
seniority
system
will
ordinarily
--
that
is
in
the
run
of
cases
--
it
ordinarily
will
trump
a
conflicting
demand
for
accommodation.
that
is
to
say
where
an
individual
with
a
disability
seeks
an
assignment
to
another
position
but
a
different
employee
has
seniority
rights
that
entitle
that
different
employee
to
the
position.
that
different
employee
ordinarily
will
win
and
we
say
that
ordinarily
the
requested
accommodation
will
not
be
reasonable
as
a
matter
of
law.
but
fifth,
the
plaintiff
remains
free
to
show
special
circumstances
that
would
require
or
bring
up
warrant
a
finding
that
the
requested
accommodation
is
reasonable
in
the
particular
circumstances.
the
plaintiff
might
show
for
example
that
the
seniority
system
has
many
other
exceptions
so
one
more
will
not
make
that
much
difference
or
that
the
employer
having
retained
the
right
to
change
the
seniority
system
unilaterally
exercises
that
right
frequently
enough
so
that
in
terms
of
employee
expectation
one
more
departure
needed
to
accommodate
a
disability
will
likely
not
matter.
the
point
is
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
explain
why
in
the
particular
case,
an
exception
to
the
employer’s
seniority
policy
makes
the
proposed
conflicting
accommodation
reasonable
even
though
in
the
ordinary
case
it
would
not
be
reasonable.
since
the
parties
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
seek
some
re-judgment
in
accordance
with
these
principles,
we
vacate
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
remand
the
case.

members
of
the
