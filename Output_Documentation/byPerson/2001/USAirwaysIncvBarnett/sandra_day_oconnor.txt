justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
talk
about
what
the
system
is
here,
because
i
found
it
a
little
hard
to
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
positions
throughout
the
company,
or
in
certain
categories
of...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
service
jobs,
once
a
quarter,
are
all
declared
open?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we're
not
talking
about
job
elimination.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
and
at
that
wi-
i-
d-
is
it
also
true,
as
i
think
you
allege,
that
the
seniority
policy
does
not
create
legally
enforceable
rights
in
any
employee?
no
employee
wanting
to
come
in
would
be
able
to
sue
to
get
that
enforced.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
kind
of
a
seniority
plan
is
that?
i
mean,
on
the
one
hand
you
say,
we
have
to
apply
our
seniority
plan,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
isn't
enforceable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
be
the
situation
if
there
were
truly
a
vacant
position
at
us
airways
in
customer
service?
would
would
you
think
the
ada
would
say
that
it
would
be
a
reasonable
accommodation
to
consider
a
disabled
employee
for
placement
in
one
of
those...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
i
mean,
there
is
a
provision
in
the
act
itself,
is
there
not,
that
speaks
to
a
vacancy
and
and
that
can
be
a
a
reasonable
accommodation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
so
why
isn't
the
sort
of
thing
that
us
airways
does
here,
declaring
all
these
jobs
open
once
a
quarter,
create
the
kind
of
thing
that
us
airways
has
to
consider
a
vacant
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
notice
that
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
sugg-
on
behalf
of
labor
unions
suggests
that
that
might
well
be
true
if
it
were
the
subject
of
collective
bargaining
and
an
agreement,
but
not
for
an
ordinary
employer
plan.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
what
meaning
do
we
give
to
reasonable
accommodation
in
the
ada?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
has
to
be
something
different,
i
assume,
than
undue
hardship,
because
that's
a
separate
defense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
a
in
a
situation
where
the
employer's
policy
is
just
to
create
open
positions
every
quarter,
that
aren't
enforceable
anyway
on
behalf
of
any
employee,
is
it
unreasonable
to
say
the
employer
has
to
accommodate
this
disabled
worker?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
can
be
a
reasonable
accommodation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
that's
the
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
some
other
employee
on
the
basis
of
greater
seniority
than
the
respondents
under
the
plan
could
take
that
slot?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
equate
that
with
the
the
situation
of
a
promotion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
you
you
think
reasonable,
the
word
reasonable
and
reasonable
accommodation
requires
examining
what
happens
to
other
employees
as
well
as
a
result
of
the
accommodation,
then
you
have
a
different
question.
