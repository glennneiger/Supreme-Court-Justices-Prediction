mr.
dellinger,
are
you
suggesting
by
that
argument
that
the
express
exception
for
bona
fide
seniority
systems
in
title
seven
was
surplug-
surpluges[:surplusages],
that
that
it
wasn't
needed,
because
there
would
have
been
it
would
have
been
counted
as
a
neutral
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
necessary
to
put
that
in
title
seven.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
th-
is
there
any
indication
that
that
that's
what
congress
thought
when
it
did-
didn't
i
mean,
it
does
seem
a
rather
conspicuous
absence,
that
the
model
statute,
the
basic
one,
has
an
express
exception
for
bona
fide
seniority
systems,
and
this
one
doesn't.
justice

mr.
dellinger...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
find
this
particular
statute
puzzling
is
that
it's
not
like
title
seven.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
did
the
statute
have
the
word,
re-
reassignment
in
it,
as
this
one
does?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
one
thing
is
easy
to
see
is
that
if
you
bump
somebody,
it's
no
good.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
we
know
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
it's
only
a
question
of,
that
nobody
is
going
to
be
bumped.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
it
been
established
that
he
in
fact
qualifies
as
disabled,
or
is
that
something
we're
just
assuming
arguendo
at
this
stage
of
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
does
have
the
effect
of
giving
a
preference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you've
said,
you're
you're
making
of
this
statute
in
this
respect
something
different
from,
in
title
seven,
where
you
have
past
proven
discrimination,
so
the
employer
may
have
to
give
a
remedy,
that
remedy
may
adversely
affect
other
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
a
matter
of
proof.
