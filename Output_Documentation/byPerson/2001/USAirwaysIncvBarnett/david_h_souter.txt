justice
david
h.
souter
for
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
argument
that
you've
repeated
in
a
car-
or
your
claim
that
you've
repeated
in
a
couple
of
instances
that
there
would
be
something
fundamentally
unhinging
to
the
seniority
system
to
allow
a
disabilities
exception.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would
go
to
that,
but
wouldn't
it
you
know,
it
would
go
to...
justice
david
h.
souter
no
there's
no
question,
to
the
extent
of
the
exceptions
their
interest
is
going
to
be
discounted
in
in
in
some
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
boils
down
to,
though,
is,
i
i
think
as
justice
ginsburg
is
suggesting,
it
means
that
no
one
can
bump
up,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
anybody
gets
bumped
down.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
we
know
that
as
a
matter
of
of
of
logic?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
true.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
that's
going
to
be
a
a
wash
no
matter
how
it
works.
justice
david
h.
souter
have
a
if
you
have
zero-sum
i
mean,
if
you
have
a
finite
number
of
employees
and
you're
laying
somebody
off,
that's...
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
aren't
you
saying
that
in
the
in
the
case
that
justice
thomas
poses
you
do
consider
the
disruption
to
your
client
as
well
as
the
interest...
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
don't
you
do
that
across
the
board?
in
other
words,
why
doesn't
why
shouldn't
why
don't
you
have
to
concede
that
reasonableness
always
takes
into
consideration
the
interest
of
other
employees?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
can
you
find
any
textual
basis
in
the
statute
that
says
when
you're
dealing
with
comparative
interests
of
two
disabled
people
you
consider
the
interests
of
both
in
determining
what
is
reasonable,
but
when
you're
considering
the
comparative
interests
of
a
disabled
person
and
others,
you
don't
consider
both?
justice
david
h.
souter
basis
for
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
weren't
conceding
it
all
right,
just
for
argument.
