justice
antonin
scalia
would
not
have
known
his
injury.
so...
so
you're
saying
the
test
under
the
act
is
not
injury,
but
knowledge
of
injury.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it
does.
you're...
you're
giving
it
away.
you're
saying
that
under
the
act,
knowledge
of
injury
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
in
practice,
that's
always
an
exception
to
the
knowledge
of
injury
rule.
with
due
diligence,
he
didn't
know.
i
mean,
but...
but
that...
you're
willing
to
accept
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
with
due
diligence...
with
due
diligence...
the
person
had
due
diligence
but
didn't
know.
so,
it's
a...
it's
a
knowledge...
it's
a
knowledge
of
injury
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
any
statute
of
limitations
of
any
sort
means
you...
you
have
to
sue
10
times
instead
of
one
time,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
the
nature
of
a
statute
of
limitations
that
when
you're
hurt,
you
have
to
sue.
you
can't
wait
till
you're
hurt
the
10th
time
and
then
say,
well,
you
know,
let's
put
it
in
one
big
package.
i'll
wait
10
years
until
i'm
hurt...
hurt
more
often.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
now,
you
say
there
is
no
hostile...
what
are
you
conceding?
that
that...
that
that
evidence
can
be
brought
in,
or
that
you
can
get
damages
for
those
events?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
if...
if
you
assert
that
there
hasn't
been
any
offense
when
those
events
occurred?
you
say
there's
not
yet
a
hostile
environment.
why
should
you
be
able
to
get
any
damages
for
a
period
during
which
there
as
not
a
hostile
environment?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
sure,
but
it
doesn't
make
the
first
one
a
hostile
environment.
justice
antonin
scalia
good.
then
change
your
answer
to
my
earlier
question
because
i
asked
you
whether
there
was
a
hostile
environment
at
the
first
incident...
incident,
and
you
said
no,
it...
there
was
not
yet
until
the
last
incident.
you're
talking
about
a
different
situation
where
there's
been
a
hostile
environment
all
along,
but
it
doesn't
become
apparent
until
the
third
incident,
but
there
really
was
one
the
first
time
the
epithet
was
used.
that's
a
different
situation,
and
we
got
to
know
which
one
of
the
two
you...
you
want
us
to
allow.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's...
let's
assume
you
have
a
hostile
work
environment
that
goes
on
for
900
days.
he
doesn't
bring
an
action
until
the
last
300
days
or
until
day
601.
what...
what
you're
saying,
i
believe...
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
hostile
work
environment
really
commenced
600
days
ago
does...
or
900
days
ago
does
not
bar
you
from
getting
damages
for
the
last
300
days.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
became...
it
became
a
hostile
work
environment--
justice
antonin
scalia
--900
days
ago.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
continued
to
be
a...
a
hostile
work
for
all
900
days.
you
can
sue
for
the
last
300
days--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
though
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
the
claim
is
not
stale,
of
course,
as
to
the
continuing
acts.
the
question
is
can
you
go
back
for
the
acts
as...
as
to
which
the
statute
arguably
has
run.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
so
the...
the
question
is
not
whether
or
not
you
can
sue
continuing
acts.
if
it's
indeed
a
continuing
act,
you
can
sue
for
the
acts
that
are
within
the...
the
period.
the
question
is
can
you
go
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
reach
it.
the
only
question
is,
you
know,
how
many
damages
you
get,
whether
you...
you
have
to
be
prompt
and
bring
your
action
soon
enough
to
put
an
end
to
it.
i
mean,
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
you
can
reach
the
pattern
or
practice.
you
certainly
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you're
not.
you're...
you're
telling
the
person
who's
been
harmed,
you
know,
if
you're
harmed,
take
action
right
away--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
the
whole
purpose
of
statutes
of
limitations.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's...
but
that's
always
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
300
days
is...
it's
almost
a
year.
the
same
thing
happens
in...
in
statutes
of...
of
limitations,
some
of
which
are
2
years,
some
of
which
are
as
short
as
1
year.
the...
the
person
who's
thinking
of
bringing
a
lawsuit
is
put
to
the
choice
of
either
negotiating
with
the
person
and
trying
to
work
it
out,
but
at
some
point,
if
he
knows
there's
a
1-year
statute
of
limitations,
he's
just
going
to
have
to
say,
i'm
sorry,
i'm
going
to
go
ahead.
and
i
don't
know
how
this
300-day
period
is
any
different
from
that.
it's
fine
to
say
you
should
be
able
to,
you
know,
waltz
around
and
talk
to
the
employer
and
talk
to,
you
know,
barbara
boxer
or
whatever
else,
but
at
some
point
the...
the
curtain
comes
down
and
you
know
that's
300
days.
that's
the
standard
operation
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
