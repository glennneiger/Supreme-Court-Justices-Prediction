justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand
how's
that's
an
exception.
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
the
period
before
the
300
days.
is
there
any
instance
in
which
you
would
allow
a
person
to
get
recovery
for
something
that
happened
to
him
prior
to
300
days
before
he
filed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
circumstance
where
they're
very
much
related
to
what
did
occur
within
the
300
days,
but
the
person
isn't
certain?
i
mean,
later
on
the
judge
says,
yes,
it
was
independently
actionable,
but
i
could
understand
how
a
person
at
the
time
might
think
it
wasn't.
what
about
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
but
i
want
to
know.
this...
that
is
the
case.
a
judge
would
say
a
reasonable
person
would
not
have
realized,
though
he
would
have
been
wrong,
that
those
outside-the-period
events
rose
to
the
level
of
giving
him
a
cause
of
action.
how
would
you
decide
that
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
you're
willing
to
give
that
one
away,
what
about
a
person
who,
though
he
might
have
understood...
a
reasonable
person
might
have
understood
that
this
would
have
been
actionable,
he's
in
the
middle
of
negotiations
with
his
company
there...
there,
and
it
would
have
been
foolish
to
go
to
the
eeoc.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
because
after
all,
we're
trying
to
settle
this
thing
right
within
the
company.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
loses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
why
should
he
lose
where
the
other
one
doesn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
talking
about
eeoc
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
you're...
you're
saying
that
there
is
no
pervasive
hostility,
no
pervasive
hostile
environment
until
the
acts
are
repeated,
or
is
it
there
is
a
pervasive
hostile
environment,
but
it's
just
not
discovered
until
the
acts
are
repeated?
which...
which
of
the
two
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
was
my...
and
that
was
my
question.
and
i
want
to
know
which
one
you
think
this
case
is,
and
i
also
want
to
know
can
there
be
both
kinds
of
cases
and
we
have
to
see
which
applies...
which
description
applies
in
each
instance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
your
theory
then,
the...
the
only
thing
that
the
continuing
violation
concept
gives,
in
effect,
is
a
right
to
use
evidence
of
something
that
happened
prior
to
the
period.
it
does
not,
in
effect,
give
any
right
to
damages
for
the...
whatever
the
damage
is
for
the
hostility
prior
to
the
300-day
period.
so,
you
turned
it
into
an
evidentiary
rule,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh.
so,
you're
saying
if
there
has
been
no...
let's...
let's
assume
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
independent
notice
of
the
hostile
environment
within
the
300-day
period.
they
would
still
be
able
to
sue
on
a
continuing
violation
theory.
whereas,
if
it
were
a
purely
evidentiary
rule,
they
would
not
be
able
to
sue
within
that
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you
also
think
he
can...
don't
you
think
he
can
get
damages
for
the
whole
900
days
if
a
reasonable
person
wouldn't
have
realized
that
those
first
600
days
were
actionable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
you...
if
you...
what
about
just
modifying
it
a
little
to
try
to
give
meaning
to
the
2
years
of
back
pay
that
you
could
get
and
all
the
other
things
and
realities
of
the
work
place,
and
say,
as
long
as
it
was
reasonable
for
him
not
to
go
to
the
eeoc,
he
can
recover
for
the
whole
900
days?
and
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
it's
reasonable
not
to
go
to
the
eeoc.
maybe
because
you
didn't
quite
understand
what
was
going
on.
maybe
you
thought
it
would
cure
itself.
maybe
you
thought
those
were
just
comments
that
some
guy
made.
he
should
be
better
educated.
maybe
you
thought
the
employer
will
work
it
out.
maybe
you
thought
your
supervisor
wasn't
the
rat
he
turned
out
to
be.
all
right,
or
whatever.
you
see
what
i'm
saying?
as
long
as
a
judge
would
say
it
was
reasonable,
what
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
why
hostile
environment
cases
are
unique.
why
is
that
the
only
kind
of
continuing
violation?
i
mean,
if
i'm
not
giving...
given
a
promotion
that
i
was
entitled
to
because
of
my
race,
i
continue
not
to
have
that
promotion
month
after
month
after
month.
why
isn't
that
as
much
of
a
continuing
violation
as
is
a
hostile
work
environment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
thought
you
said
the
opposite.
if...
if
it
accrues
now,
i
can
still
sue
900...
900
days
later
for
the
hostile
work
environment
of
the
last
300
days.
i
thought
that's
what
you
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
a
continuing...
let...
let's...
let's
take
the
failure
to
give
a
person
a
promotion
because
of
her
sex
or
his
race
or
whatever.
let's
assume
that
that
occurs
and
then...
and
then
the
claim
is
made
2
years
later.
during
that
whole
2
years,
the
person
hasn't
gotten
the
promotion.
and
is
it
your
position
that...
that
when
it
is
finally
filed
2
years
later,
you
can
get
back
pay
or
damages
for
the
whole
2
years,
even
though,
you
know,
you
had
the
claim
2
years
ago.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i...
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
what
your
answer
is
to
my
hypothetical,
and...
and
i
asked
the
hypothetical
because
frankly
i
don't
see
how
a
hostile
environment
claim
is
any
different
from
a
failure
to
promote
claim.
that
failure
to
promote
continues.
the...
the
loss
of
salary
continues
right
over
the
2
years,
just
as
a
hostile
environment
claim
continues
over
2
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
have
a
continuing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
you
have
a
continuing
violation,
a
hostile
environment,
made
up
of
many
minor
acts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
goes
on
for
many,
many
years.
and
the...
the
injured
individual
finally
goes
to
the
eeoc
after
a
very
long
time.
in
your
opinion,
can
he
recover
damages
then
back
for
the
entire
10
years
or
15
years,
or
is
there
some
cutoff
point
behind
which
you
won't
get
the
damages?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
he
does.
let's
assume
he
does.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
they
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
wonder.
you
see,
if
at
some
point
we
might
say,
well,
he
should
have
gone
to
the
eeoc.
it
was
unreasonable
of
him
not
to.
i
wouldn't
say
he
had
to
do
it
immediately,
but
after
many
years?
and...
and
do
we
want
to
give
him
damages
all
the
way
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
is
it
that
if
there's
a
continuing
violation,
say,
for
900
days
and
you
file
on
the
900th
day,
that
you
can
go
back
for
the
first
600
days?
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i
thought
your
answer
might
be
that
it's
difficult
to
know
that
there's
a
pervasive
environment
until
you
look
at
a
whole
context
of
acts.
i'm
not
sure
that
would
be
a
conclusive...
but
at
least
that's
a
reason.
but
when
you
say,
well,
it's
necessary
in
order
to
enforce
the
act,
that...
that
just
begs
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
that's
one
reason.
suppose...
suppose
that
we
play
with
the
hypothetical
and
we
establish
that
it
wasn't
difficult
to
know.
is
there
any
other
reason
for
allowing
us...
for
requiring
the
courts
to
go
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ms.
price,
i
don't
understand
the
rationale
for
treating
continuing
violations
differently
in
so
far
as
how
far
you
can
go
back
to
get
damages.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you...
you
can't
bring
suit
for
that
if
you
don't
sue
within
300
days.
suppose
it's
not
a
failure
to
promote.
it
is
simply
a
failure
to
pay
the
salary
that
this
person
in...
in
the
job
the
person
has
is
entitled
to,
and
that's
a
continuing
violation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
continues
on
and
on.
and
you're
saying
that
even
though
that's
been
continuing
on
and
on
for
2
years
and
the...
the
employee
doesn't
take
any
action,
he
can
go
all
the
way
back
for
the
whole
2
years
instead
of
just
back
for
the
last
30
days...
last
300
days.
i...
i
don't
see
conceptually
why
that
ought
to
be
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
it's
not
a
continuing
violation.
