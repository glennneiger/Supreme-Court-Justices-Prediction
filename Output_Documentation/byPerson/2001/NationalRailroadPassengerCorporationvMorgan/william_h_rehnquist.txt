chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
00-1614,
the
national
railroad
passenger
corporation
v.
abner
morgan.
mr.
englert.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
a
subjective
knowledge
of
injury
but
knowledge
of
injury
that...
that
would
have
occurred
to
a
reasonable
person.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
englert.
mr.
schlick,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there...
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
for
not
going
to
court
too,
but
we've
never
said
those
toll
the
statute
of
limitations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schlick.
ms.
price,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
havens
was
a
different
statute,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
have
we
ever
set
aside
this
type
of
statute
and
said
we
give
all
possible
breaks
to
plaintiffs
on
it?
i
don't
believe
we
have.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you...
if
you
say
that
an
event,
if
it
occurred
in
isolation,
would
be
actionable,
you
are
saying
then
that
it
was
actionable
by
itself
without
combining
it
with
anything
else.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
retaliation
is
a
separate
claim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if...
he
complained
in
october
1991
to
the
eeoc,
didn't
he?
and
if
he
discovered
then
what
was
going
on,
shouldn't
the
statute
at
least
have
started
running
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
did
go
to
eeoc.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when...
when
was
the
first
time
he
filed
a
complaint
with
the
eeoc?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
price.
mr.
englert,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
no.
00-1614,
national
railroad
passenger
corporation
versus
morgan
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
