mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
ongoing
violations
of
the
law
must
be
treated
differently
from
discrete
acts.
a
continuing
unlawful
practice
which
involves
a
present
violation
of
the
act
means
that
the
claim
is
not
stale.
limiting
liability
to
180
days
solely
would
essentially
nullify
section
706(g).
it
would
allow
the
defendant
in
this
case
amtrak...
would
essentially
negate
the
language
of
title
vii
which
speaks
in
terms
of
practices.
it
speaks
specifically
to
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
this
is
true.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
yes,
your
honor.
and
it
is
true
that
we
believe
that
you
can
go
back.
with
respect
to
back
pay,
congress
has
specifically
provided
under
706(g)
that
you
can
go
back
2
years
for
back
pay
liability.
with...
and
there
is
a
difference
between
a
liability
for
damages
and
liability
for
essentially
liability's
sake.
under
the
statute,
under
title
vii,
congress
did
not
put
a
limit
in
as
to
how
far
you
could
go
back.
it
said
you
must
file
the
charge
within
300
days
for
purposes
of
initiating
the
conciliatory
involvement
of
the
eeoc.
but
filing
the
charge
while,
you
said
in
zipes,
it's
like
a
statute
of
limitations,
it
does
not
dictate
how
far
you
go
back
in
terms
of
establishing
the
employer's
liability.
you
said
in
havens
that
where
you
have
a
continuing
practice
of
discrimination,
that
it
is
appropriate
to
allow
the
plaintiff
to
recover
for
the
entire
practice
and--
ms.
pamela
y.
price
--it
is
a...
it
is...
yes,
sir.
it
was
a
different
statute
but
it
has
the
same
language
and
it
has
the
same
purpose.
it
was
a
statute
intended
to
outlaw
discrimination,
and
it
is
supposed
to
be
interpreted
with
the
same
understanding,
one,
that
it's
a
statute
that's
going
to
be
utilized
by
lay
persons,
and
two,
that
it
has
a
broad
remedial
intent.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
no.
i
don't
believe
you
have.
and
i
think
what
you
said
in
zipes,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
that
it
was
necessary
to
strike
a
balance
to
allow
for
the
prompt
filing
for...
to
give
notice
to
allow
the
eeoc
to
give
notice
to
the
employer
and
to
be
sure
to
effectuate
the
remedial
intent
of
the
statute.
so,
there
was
a
balance
struck.
if
you
date
the
trigger
period
for
the
statute
of
limitations
from
the
date
that
the
person
either
knew
or
reasonably
should
have
known,
you
disrupt
that
balance
because
then
you're
moving
the
trigger
from
the
last
occurrence
of
the
practice
to
an
uncertain
time
when
the
plaintiff
either
reasonably
should
have
known
or
unreasonably
should
have
known.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
it
is...
yes,
ma'am.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
yes,
ma'am.
i
would
agree
that
it
has
taken
a...
that
there
is
a
split
in
the
circuits.
i
believe--
ms.
pamela
y.
price
--well,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit's
position
is
actually
in
the
majority
view.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
yes.
[laughter]
yes,
but
none
of
the
circuits
disagree
about
what
constitutes
a
continuing
violation.
where
the
disagreement
is
is
in...
similar
in
this
case.
there's
a
disagreement
between
us
and
amtrak
as
to
when
the
trigger
for
the
practice...
for
the
charge-filing
requirement
occurs.
there's
a
disagreement
as...
with...
between
us
and
the
government
as
to
what
is
covered
in
that
300-day
period.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
well,
you
look,
as
the
circuits
have
uniformly
looked,
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
a
practice
or
a
continuing
violation.
you...
it's...
you...
if
you
look
at
the
case
as
a
series
of
discrete
acts,
then
yes,
we
lose.
but
it's
not
a
case
where
there's
a
series
of
discrete
acts,
and
in
fact,
the
majority
of
the
issues
that
mr.
morgan
was
addressing
were
not
actionable
in
and
of
themselves.
the
initiation
of
disciplinary
action--
ms.
pamela
y.
price
--i...
no,
i
don't.
i
think
that
there
were
some
that,
if
they
had
occurred
in
isolation,
could
have
been
actionable.
when
we
presented
the
case,
we
did
not
pursue
this
case
as
one
for
a
violation,
for
example,
of
the...
his
termination
and
then
ultimate
suspension
in
1991.
we
did--
ms.
pamela
y.
price
--yes,
sir,
i
am
saying
that.
it
is
true
that
if
that
is...
the
difference
between
a
discrete
act
and
a
continuing
practice
of
discrimination.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
well,
a
promotion,
as
i
understand
the
law,
is
a
distinct
area,
and
there
are
some
circumstances
where
the
courts
have
held
that
a
promotion
would
result
in
extending
the
time
for
one
to
recover
damages.
there
are
other
situations
where
we
want
to
distinguish
between
a
promotion
that
simply
involves
the
continuing
effects.
we're
not
talking
about,
as...
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
a
promotion
in
this
case
or
a
situation
where
it's
simply
mr.
morgan
is
suffering
the
continuing
effects
of
a
prior
decision.
we're
talking
about
a
continuing
series
of
acts
that
continued
up
until
the
charge-filing
period
that
were
motivated
by
retaliation
and
discrimination.
we're
talking
about
a
hostile
environment
claim,
and
the
court
should
be
clear
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
case
involved
a
hostile
environment.
we
brought
that
to
the
trial
court's
attention,
and
on
october
22nd,
1998,
she
issued
a
specific
order
ruling--
ms.
pamela
y.
price
--this
court
has
defined
a
hostile
environment
as
the...
the
actionable
part
of
it
is
the
environment
itself.
it's
not
the
discrete
acts.
in
the
justice's
hypothetical,
i
believe
that
you're
focusing
on
the
discrete
act
of
a
failure
to
promote
that
individual,
which
is...
has
a
definite
beginning,
end.
it's
right
there.
it
happens.
in
a
hostile
environment,
it's
not
so
simple.
hostile
environment...
you
can
have
an
act
that
might
not
be
actionable,
but
when
you...
when
you
look
at
it
over
a
period
of
time,
a
series
of
acts,
that
it's
cumulative
and
the
harm
is
indivisible.
in
a
promotion
case,
the
harm
is
related
solely
to
the
failure
to
promote.
in
a
hostile
environment
case,
you
can't
separate
the
harm
that's
caused
on
day
899
from
the
harm
that's
caused
on
day
200.
ms.
pamela

yes.
yes,
justice

ms.
pamela

yes,

ms.
pamela

yes,
sir.
ms.
pamela
y.

the
ability
to
recover
damages
in
that
circumstances
depends
on
a
number
of
factors.
first
would
be
the
plaintiff's
ability
to
establish
that
it
is
in
fact
a
continuing
violation
that--
ms.
pamela
y.
price
--then
his
ability
would
be
affected
by
this
court's
decisions
in
both
faragher
and
burlington
industries
where
this
court
said
that
if
there's
no
tangible
employment
action
and
the
employer
can
show
that
it
has
taken
appropriate
steps
to
prevent
or
remedy
discrimination,
and
the
plaintiff--
ms.
pamela
y.
price
--okay.
[laughter]
well,
if
they
can't
show
that
the
victim
unreasonably
failed
to
take
advantage
of
whatever
remedies
or
opportunities
were...
were
not
available
or
should
have
been
available,
then
yes,
the
plaintiff
would--
ms.
pamela
y.
price
--the
damages
question
again
is
a
separate
question
from
liability.
the
damages
are
going
to
be
limited
by
706(g)
which
provides
a
2-year
cap
on
back
pay
and
by
the
caps
that
congress
has
enacted
for
compensatory
damages.
for
instance,
if...
if
his
employer
was,
you
know,
within
that
$50,000
range,
he's
only
going
to
get
$50,000.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
because
the
statute
must
have
the
ability
to
reach
practices.
where
you
have
a
longstanding
pattern
or
practice
of
retaliation
or
discrimination,
this
statute
in
particular
is
designed
to
get
at
that.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
well,
but
if
you
limit
the
period
for
which
you
can
reach
it
to
only
300
days,
you're
essentially
immunizing
the
employer
who
has
engaged
in
a
longstanding--
ms.
pamela
y.
price
--well--
ms.
pamela
y.
price
--you're
telling
the
person
not
simply
to
take
action,
justice
scalia,
but
to
take
action
that
it
may
in
fact
result
in
greater
retaliation
or
a
loss
of
employment.
you're
not
telling
them
simply
to
go
to
the
employer--
ms.
pamela
y.

--well,
i
think
that
there
are
cases
where
it's
difficult
to
know.
there
are
also
cases
where
people--
ms.
pamela
y.
price
--it's
not
that...
well,
it's
because
it's
fundamentally
a
continuing
violation
of
the
statute,
and
the
statute
itself
allows
for
you
to
deal
with
practices.
number
two,
you
have
the
706(g)
statute
which
allows
the
court
to...
or
allows
a...
entitles
a
victim
of
discrimination
to
recover
damages
for
a
2-year
period,
for
back
pay.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
yes.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
that
is
correct,
and
the
reason
why
is
because
congress
looked
at
this
problem.
they
looked
at
this
problem
in
1972.
they
looked
at
the
problem
again
in
1991.
congress
did
not
set
an
anterior
limit
on
liability
under
title
vii,
and
where
congress
has
not
acted
to
do
that,
it
is
not
appropriate
for
the
court
to
set
that
limit.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
i
can
understand
why
you
should
treat
them
differently
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
you
can
bring
suit
at
all.
that
is,
if
it's
a
continuing
violation,
the
mere
fact
that
you
didn't
bring
suit
within
300
days
after
the
violation
started
doesn't
matter.
you
can...
you
can
bring
suit
at
any
point
during
the
continuing
violation.
but
it's
a
separate
question
whether,
once
you
do
bring
suit,
you
can
get
damages
all
the
way
back
to
the
beginning
of
it
or
rather
damages
just
back
300
days.
i
see
no...
no
reason
conceptually
why
you
should
have...
you
should
be
able
to
go
all
the
way
back.
take
a
failure
to
promote,
which
we
discussed
before,
which
you
say
is
a
one-shot
violation,
not
a
continuing
violation.
okay?
yes,
your
honor.
ms.

yes.
ms.

706(g)
determines
how
far
one
can
go
for
back
damages.
if
the
concern
is
one
with
respect
to
liability,
the
difference...
conceptually
there
may
not
be
a
difference.
but
in
fact
in
the...
in
bazemore,
this
court
addressed
that
particular
scenario,
and
in
that
particular
scenario,
the
court
said
every
time
the
person
receives
a...
a
check
that's
less,
then
that
constitutes
a
violation.
i
mean,
it's
conceivable
under
your...
under
the
court's
hypothetical
that
the
employee
could
file
a
charge
for
each
one
of
those
paychecks,
and
i
think
that
that
sort
of
turns
congress'--
ms.
pamela
y.
price
--right.
i
mean,
and
that...
that
upsets
i
believe
what
congress
really
intended
to
do.
that
would
essentially
eliminate
the
caps
entirely.
and
we
have
that
potential
problem
in
this
case.
if
you
look
at
this
case
as
a
series
of
discrete
acts,
you
require
mr.
morgan
to
file
a
charge
every
time
he's
charged
with
a
rule
l
violation
or
every
time
they
threaten
to
charge
him
or
every
time
they
suggest
that
he
shouldn't
have
been...
that
he
was
2
minutes
late
for
work.
those
kinds
of
things
in
and
of
themselves
should
not
become
the
basis
for
title
vii
charges.
you
have
to
allow
for
the
circumstance
where
the
employee
is
in
fact
being
subjected
to
a...
a
persistent
and
a
continuing
pattern
of
discrimination
that
becomes
actionable
within
the
300-day
or
the
180-day
charge-filing
period.
ms.
pamela
y.

no.
i
think
no,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
i
think
that
it's
appropriate
to
look
at
this
continuing
violation
circumstance
in
the
same
way
in
which
the
court
has
looked
at
the
hostile
environment
claim.
and
in
the
hostile
environment
claim,
the
court
has
imposed
both
an
objective
test
and
a
subjective
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
hostile
environment.
that's
in
the
definition
of
the
cause
of
action.
in
this
case,
the
definition
of
the
cause
of
action
is
already
found
within
title
vii.
title
vii
defines
what
practices
violate
the
act.
with
respect
to
the
timing,
title
vii
doesn't
say...
there's
nowhere
in
title
vii
where
it
says
that
you...
the
charge-filing
is
triggered
where
the
person
knows
or
should
have
known.
there
is
no
notice
requirement
in
title
vii.
title
vii
ties
the
requirement
that
you
file
a
charge
from
the
last
date...
the
last
occurrence
of
the
unlawful
practice.
that's
what
the
statute
says,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
has
to
impose
on
employers.
that
is
the
certainty
that
employers
are

language
in

true
that
there
have
been
times
when
it's
been
referred

as
a
statute
of

in

that's
really
all
it
does.
there's
other
statutes
of
limitations
or
things
that

a
statute

you
have
the
90-day
period
in
which
one

this

imposed.
ms.
pamela

yes.
ms.
pamela

utilized
with
change
depending
on
where
one
lived,
depending
on
what
sector
of
the
employment
arena
one
is
found
in.
so,
it's
not
appropriate
to
rely
upon
this
particular
statute
as
determining
the
period
of
liability.
you
must
look
to
706(g)
and
you
must
look
to
the
caps
where
congress
specifically
tried
to
address
the
concerns
of
employers.
viewing
this
case
solely
as
a...
as
a
series
of
discrete
acts
ignores
the
fundamental
problem
that
mr.
morgan
faced
at
amtrak.
mr.
morgan
thought
that
the...
the
practices
the
he
was
being
subjected
to
were
only
being
perpetuated
by
a
few
managers.
what
he
discovered,
when
he
complained...
and
you
must
acknowledge
that
he
did
complain.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
the
person
sat
on
his
rights,
as
amtrak
would
portray
him.
mr.
morgan
did
complain,
and
then
he
discovered
that
amtrak
absolutely
refused
to
address
those
practices
that
were
going
on
in
the
oakland
yard.
ms.
pamela
y.

well,
there's
no
indication
that
he
discovered...
he
knew
that
there
were
racist
practices
going
on
at
the
yard.
he
complained
to
congresswoman
barbara
boxer
and
he
complained
to
the
eeoc
with
the
anticipation
that
there
would
be
some
action
taken.
in
fact,
in
1992
inspector

come
out
at
the
insistence
of
congresswoman

at
that
situation.
but
that
was
a
process
that
took
over
10
months.
subsequently
when
he
did
complain
again
in
1993,
amtrak
took
9
months
to
investigate.
to
require
him
to...
to
go
to
eeoc
within
a
6-month
or
a
10-month
window
essentially
negates
his
ability--
ms.
pamela

--he
went
to
eeoc,
yes,
when
they
indicated
that
they
intended
to
fire
him,
and
that
would
result
in
the
absolute
termination
of
his
relationship
with
amtrak.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
yes.
ms.
pamela
y.

yes.
yes,
throughout
that
process.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
he
went
to
amtrak's
eeo.
he
filed
eight
separate
charges
with
them,
and
they
only
responded--
ms.
pamela
y.
price
--it
was
in
february
of
1995.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
in
this
case,
mr....
justice
scalia,
the...
as
i
pointed
out,
the...
the
statute
of
limitations
operates
somewhat
differently.
it's
like
a
statute
of
limitations.
more
to
the
point,
however,
in
this
case,
as
in
the
cases
that
are
addressed
by
title
vii,
you're
talking
about
an
employment
relationship,
an
ongoing
relationship
where
the
evidence
that
is...
we've
presented
in
our
amicus
briefs
is
that
the
person
wants
to
maintain
their
employment,
and
there
is
a
very
real
fear
that
if
you
go
outside
the
scope
of
your
employment
to
an
outside
agency,
that's
going
to
tear
apart
the
employment
relationship.
that...
that
is
essentially
crossing
the
river,
and
you
can't
go
back
from
that.
and
so,
it's
very
important
to
allow
people
an
opportunity,
and
that's
the...
the
focus
of
the
statute
was
to
allow
the
eeoc
not
to
come
in
and
file
a
lawsuit,
but
to
come
in
and
conciliate,
to
try
to
resolve
the
problem
without
the
necessity
of
a
lawsuit.
so,
you
don't
want
to
adopt
a
strict
interpretation
or
a
hard
and
fast
rule
that
says
you've
got
to
file
a
lawsuit
or
you've
got
to
start
this
process
within
10
months.
that
is
not...
that
doesn't
give
the
employer
nor
the
employee
an
opportunity
to
try
to
resolve
matters
internally.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
i
regret,
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
not...
i
don't
know
how
many.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
this
is
true.
and
again,
it's
interpreted.
it
has
to
be
interpreted
because
it
applies
in
other
areas
of
the
law,
and
it
does
define...
it
really
defines
the
point
at
which
you
have
to
try
to
get
an
outside
agency
to
come
in.
it
doesn't
define
the
point
at
which
you
have
to
sue,
and
it
doesn't
define
the
point
that
limits
your
damages.
that
is
what
is
critical.
congress
has
defined
the...
the
point
of
damages.
congress
has
not
defined
the
point
of
liability.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
congress
had
an
opportunity.
the
problem
with
mr.
englert's
view
of
it
is
that
congress
had
another
opportunity
after
this
court's
decision
in
zipes
in
1991,
and
congress
did
not
change
either
706(g)
and
it
didn't
change
706(e).
it
did
address
the
very
concern
that
employers
were
raising,
that
we're
going
to
be
subjected
to
unlimited
damages
where
you...
if
you
allow
compensatory
damages,
and
congress
put
in
the
caps.
congress
addressed
this
problem
in
a
different
way
by
putting
in
temporal...
excuse
me...
nontemporal
limits,
by
putting
in
a
monetary
limit.
congress
could
have
put
in
a
temporal
limit,
and
it
did
not.
it
could
have
taken
out
706(g),
and
it
did
not.
so,
to
suggest
that
that
section
is...
is
a
superfluous
section
that
only
addresses
some
long
past
effect
of
title
vii
or
a
doctrine
that
is
no
longer
a
part
of
title
vii
is
inaccurate.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
not
under
the
petitioner's
theory,
no.
i
think
that
they're
reading
706(g)
out
of
the
statute,
which
this
court
should
not
do.
ultimately
in
hostile
environment
cases,
the
sexual
harassment
victim...
if
you
impose
this
requirement,
the
sexual
harassment
victim,
in
particular,
runs
the
risk
of
being...
of
filing
either
too
early
or
filing
too
late.
again,
in
love
v.
pullman,
this
court
recognized
that
this
process
is
one
that
is
initiated
and
utilized
by
lay
persons
unassisted
by
trained
lawyers.
you
should
not
impose
a
requirement
upon
a
lay
person
to
determine,
oh,
now...
when
this
continuing
violation
doctrine
is
going
to
start
and
when
my
damages
are
going
to
start
accruing.
and
therefore,
now
i
must
file
with
the
eeoc.
they
are...
the
last
act
which
is
what
congress
contemplated
is
what
has
to
be
the
trigger
for
the
statute.
ms.
pamela
y.
price
i
think
that
the
courts
have
not...
have
been
able
to
determine
where
there's
a
discrete
act,
and
there's
nothing
happens.
and
this
is
really
where
this
court
has
set
the
outer
limit.
the...
it
requires
a
present
violation.
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
determine
what's
a
discrete
act
and
what
is
a
part
of
a
pattern.
