mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
25
years
ago
in
united
air
lines
v.
evans,
this
court
observed
that
an
employer
was
entitled
to
treat
a
past
act
as
lawful
after
respondent
failed
to
file
a
timely
charge
of
discrimination.
in
the
court's
words...
and
i
quote...
a
discriminatory
act,
which
has
not
made
the
basis
for
a
timely
charge,
is
the
legal
equivalent
of
a
discriminatory
act
which
occurred
before
the
statute
was
passed.
the
court
further
referred
to
the
alleged
discriminatory
act
outside
the
limitations
period
as
merely
an
unfortunate
event
in
history
which
has
no
present
legal
consequences.
in
the
present
case,
abner
morgan
challenges
as
discriminatory
various
acts
that
he
did
not
make
the
basis
for
an
eeoc
charge
within
300
days.
our
contention
is
that
amtrak
was
entitled
to
treat
those
past
acts
as
lawful
after
the
passage
of
300
days.
those
acts
are
merely
unfortunate
events
in
history
with
no
present
legal
consequences.
the
ninth
circuit
saw
things
quite
differently.
according
to
the
ninth
circuit,
all
plaintiffs,
completely
without
regard
to
their
own
diligence,
may
base
suit
on
events
they
didn't
make
the
basis
of
a
timely
charge,
as
long
as
those
events
are
sufficiently
related
to
later
events
that
can
also
be
characterized
as
discrimination.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
for
certain
diligent
plaintiffs--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--who
bring
suit
within
300
days
after
their
cause
of
action
first
accrues,
we
would
look
back.
that
obviously
isn't
this
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
we
would
allow
plaintiffs,
in
exactly
the
situation
you
described,
justice
o'connor,
to
look
back,
the
situation
in
which
it
was
not
fully
evident
until
within
the
300-day
period
what
was
going
on.
that
is
the
exception
we're
willing
to
concede.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
justice
breyer.
if
the--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--if
the
events
outside
the
300-day
window
were
not
sufficiently
severe
or
pervasive
to
rise
to
the
level
of
being
actionable,
then
we
would
concede
that
the
cause
of
action
doesn't
accrue
until
they've
become
sufficiently
severe
or
pervasive.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
there
may
be
close
cases,
justice
breyer,
and--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--we...
we
would
give
away
that
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
if
a
reasonable
person
would
not
have
known--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
justice
scalia,
that
gets
into
the
debate,
of
course,
this
court
has
had--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no.
i...
i'm
not
trying
to
give
that
away.
i'm
trying
not
to
take
a
position
on
that.
i
understood
justice
breyer's
question
to
pertain
to
the
situation
in
which
the
judge
says
a
reasonable
person
would
not
have
known,
not
this
particular
plaintiff
wouldn't
have
known,
but
a
reasonable
person
would
not
have
known.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
why
i'm
not
trying
to
give
away
anything
on
injury
versus
injury
discovery.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice,
and--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that
plaintiff
loses.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
plaintiff
loses,
justice
breyer.
that's
quite
clear.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
quite
clear
under
cases
like
robinson
meyers.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
because
this
court
has
said
so.
cases
like
robinson
meyers
and
johnson
v.--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--those...
those
are
title
vii
cases
in
which...
robinson
meyers
was
a
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
exhausted
union
grievances
and
then
filed
the
eeoc
charge,
and
the
court
said,
no,
you
should
have
filed
your
eeoc
charge
within
the
statutory
period.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
it's
not
when
in
doubt,
sue,
justice
ginsburg.
it
is
when
in
doubt,
go
to
the
eeoc,
and
it's
an
important
distinction
because
the
purpose
of
filing
with
the
eeoc
is
to
start
a
conciliatory
process.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
much
i
am
saying,
and
that
is
very
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
title
vii
charge-filing
requirement,
which
is
to
cause
plaintiffs
to
go
promptly
to
the
eeoc,
as
this
court
itself
has
said
in
a
number
of
its
cases,
and
to
get
that
process
started
quickly.
now,
there...
there
could
be
rare
cases,
justice
ginsburg,
in
which
equitable
tolling
would
apply
on
the
facts
that
you've
suggested.
this
isn't
one
of
them,
and
i
don't
think
there
are
many
such
cases.
but
if
one
is
in
the
middle
of
some
kind
of
negotiation
and
is
being
misled
into
thinking
that
it's
all
going
to
work
out
and
therefore
don't
got
to
the
eeoc,
that
person
might
have
an
equitable
tolling
argument,
although
as
this
court
has
said,
the
virtue
of
equitable
tolling
is
that
it
is
so
rarely
invoked--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
justice
scalia,
and--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes.
that's
part
of
the
definition
of
the
very
violation
of
title
vii
in
hostile
environment
cases.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
case
i'm
willing
to
concede,
looking
back
beyond
300
days,
is
the
case
in
which
there
is
no
hostile
environment
until
within
the
300-day
period.
the
fact
that
the
hostile
environment
isn't
discovered
i
have
not
conceded.
that...
that
case
i
have
not
conceded.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i'm
conceding
that
you
can
get
back
pay
or
damages
for
those
events
as
the
seventh
circuit
said
in
galloway
and
as
the
first
circuit
said
in
sabree.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
the
hypothetical
example,
justice
scalia,
that
i
think
makes
the
point
is
suppose
there
is
an
epithet
at
the
office
christmas
party
one
year.
then
there's
an
epithet
at
the
office
christmas
party
the
next
year.
then
there's
an
epithet
at
the
office
christmas
party
the
third
year,
and
the
person
has
to
seek
psychological
counseling
after
each
of
those.
it's
not
going
to
rise
to
the
level,
in
all
likelihood,
of
a
hostile
environment
after
one
epithet,
but
with
repetition,
it
can
rise
to
the
level
of
a
hostile
environment.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
but
the
statute
of
limitations,
under
standard
accrual
principles,
didn't
begin
to
run
until
it
became
a
hostile
environment,
and
we're
suggesting--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
i--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
think--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--justice
souter...
and
i
don't
know
that
i
want
to
spend
much
more
of
my
argument
on
concessions,
but--
[laughter]
--i
think
the...
the
point
is
that
the
entire
series
of
actions
that
constitute
the
hostile
environment
are
all
part
of
the
hostile
environment,
but
it
may
not--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--in
20/20
hindsight,
this
is
how
hostile
environment
cases
work.
an
epithet
that
was
not
a
hostile
environment
on
day
1
may
actually
become
part
of
a
hostile
environment
on
day
300.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
okay.
in...
in
this
case,
mr.
morgan
was
complaining
to
members
of
congress
starting
in
1991.
there
is
absolutely
no
doubt
that
he
thought
that
he
was
being
discriminated
against
from
long
before
the
statute
of
limitations
ran.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
not
primarily,
but
there
is
a
hostile
environment
claim
in
this
case
as
the
ninth
circuit
saw
it.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
pattern
or
practice
is
a
term
in
section
707
of
the
act,
which
applies
exclusively
to
governmental
actions,
and
the
court
has
used
that
phrase
in
certain
class
actions
as
well...
in
private
class
actions,
but
this
is
not
a
class
action
either.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
ninth
circuit
believed
there
was,
yes.
but
in
any
event,
mr.
morgan
was...
was
well
aware
long
before
he
filed
his
eeoc
charge
that
he
had
a...
a
claim
of
discrimination.
i--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
think
not,
justice
stevens,
but
that
raises
two
issues
that
are
not
in
this
case.
one
is
fraudulent
concealment,
and
the
second
is
the
issue
of
injury
versus
injury
discovery
for
statutes
of
limitation--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
my
short
answer
is
no.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
my
longer
answer
is
no
unless
this
court
resolves
an
issue
that
is
not
presented
by
this
case
which
is
injury
versus
injury
discovery
in
favor
of
an
injury
discovery
rule.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
issue
is
not
in
this
case,
but
that
is
my...
i'm
saying
injury
would
be
enough.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it
could
be,
but
the
reason
i'm
making
a
concession
with
regard
to
hostile
environment
claims
is
not
injury
versus
injury
discovery.
the
reason
i'm
making
a
concession
is
because
under
standard
principles
of
accrual,
the
plaintiff
may
not
sue
until
he
or
she
actually
has
a
cause
of
action.
and
because
a
hostile
environment
claim
can
only
develop
over
time,
it
may
be
that
not
until
the
third,
fourth,
fifth
epithet,
incident
is...
is
there
anything
for
the
plaintiff
to
sue
on.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there...
no.
there
can
always
be
recovery
for
the
portion
of
the
continuing
violation
within
the
300
days.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
and
let
me
try
very
quickly
to
say
why
that
argument
is
not
a
good
argument.
congress
did
worry
that
there
was
no
time
limit
on
title
vii
actions
and
it
put
the
2
years
in
there.
but
that's
because
of
the
continuing
effects
doctrine,
which
this
court
repudiated
in
1977,
and
that's
because
this
court
hadn't
clearly
said
the
title
vii
statute
of
limitations
is
section
706(e)
until
1982
in
zipes.
many
of
the
lower
courts
were
actually
borrowing
state
statutes
of
limitations
on
the
theory
that
title
vii
had
no
statute
of
limitations
of
its
own.
this
court
laid
that
to
rest
in
zipes,
and
now
all
of
the
federal
courts
of
appeals,
including
the
ninth
circuit,
agree
that
706(e)
is
a
statute
of
limitations.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
o'connor,
in
one
of
her
questions
for
ms.
price,
referred
to
the
very
lopsided
split
in
the
circuits,
and
i
agree
that
there's
a
very
lopsided
split
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit's
view.
only
one
of
those
many
circuit
cases
that
i'm
aware
of...
at
least
the
recent
circuit
cases...
actually
discusses
the
706(g)
issue
that's
taken
up
much
of
the
argument
time
today,
and
that
is
the
first
circuit's
opinion
in
sabree,
which
actually
comes
out
squarely
where
we
come
out
in
this
case,
that
in
general
damages
are
cut
off
at
300
days.
there
is
an
exception,
the
details
of
which
it's
probably
better
not
to
spend
any
more
time
on.
but
we
agree
with
the
sabree
result.
under
no
circumstances
does
our
view
render
section
706(g)
superfluous.
i
do
think
it's
something
of
an
anachronism
enacted
to
deal
with
problems
that
went
away,
but
under
no
circumstances
is
it
superfluous.
in
cases
of
equitable
tolling,
in
government
suits
against
municipalities
under
section
707
where
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations,
in
the
kinds
of
hostile
environment
cases
we
were
discussing
earlier,
the
2-year
back
pay
cap
can
have
effect.
let
me
mention
very
briefly,
although
not
much
time
was
spent
on
it
earlier,
the
havens
case
was
decided
under
a
different
statute.
in
the
lorance
case,
the
solicitor
general
urged
the
court
to
follow
havens.
the
court
said
no.
the
court
didn't
address
havens
in
its
opinion.
it
said...
but
it
said...
did
say
in
its
opinion
the
more
relevant
precedents
are
the
nlra
precedents,
which
squarely
support
the
position
we're
taking
here
today.
because--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--very
little,
if
any,
your
honor.
i
think
they
might
concede
less
than
i
was
conceding
earlier,
but
other
than
that,
i
think
there's
very
little
difference.
and
the
government,
quite
importantly,
in
its
brief
says
what
the
continuing
violation
doctrine
is,
and
what
the
continuing
violation
doctrine
is
in
all
other
areas
of
law
besides
title
vii
is
essentially
what
some
of
justice
scalia's
questions
were
suggesting,
which
is
you're
not
out
of
court
entirely
just
because
you
didn't
bring
suit
within
300
days
of
the
first
incident
or
4
years
in
the
case
of
the
clayton
act.
you
do
get
to
bring
suit,
but
you
only
get
damages
reaching
back
to
the
limitations
period.
let
me
mention
very
quickly.
amtrak
did
win
this
case
at
trial.
so,
i
don't
want
the
court
to
have
the
impression
that
it's
conceded
that
there
was
racial
discrimination
going
on,
but
i'll
leave
it
at
that.
and
finally,
just
a
detail.
43
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
more
or
less
are
deferral
states.
that's
the
figure
the
government
has
given
me,
and
i'm...
i'm
certain
it's
more
than
40
states
are
deferral
states.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
only
logic
is
that
that's
what
congress
said.
if
it's
a
single
incident
case
and
you
file
on
the
181st
day,
you're
out
of
court
if
you're
not
in
a
deferral
state.
