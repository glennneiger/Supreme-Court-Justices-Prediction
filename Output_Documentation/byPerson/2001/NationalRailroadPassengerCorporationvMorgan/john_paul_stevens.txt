john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
about
a
hypothetical
that's
perhaps
a
little
simpler
to
discuss?
supposing
the
company
had
a
policy
that
was
unwritten
or
secret
or
something
like
that,
we
will
not
allow
any
woman
into
a
certain
job
category,
no
woman,
no
black
into
a
certain
job
category.
it's...
it's
found
out
3
years
after
the
policy
was
formally
described
and
so
forth.
and
then
a
person
who
repeatedly
tried
to
get
into
that
job
category
over
the
entire
3-year
period
but
was
refused
each
time
because
of
the
existence
of
a
continuing
policy,
does
that
person
have
any
right
to
recover
for
anything
happening
prior
to
the
300
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
assuming
there's
no
discovery,
but
i'm
assuming--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you
can
ever
describe
anything
as
a
continuing
violation,
i
have
described
a
continuing
discriminatory
policy.
and
if
it's
clear
as
a
bell
that
it's
all
one
policy
and
it
had
a
several...
manifested
itself
in
several
different
incidents,
is
it...
may
a
plaintiff
recover
for
something
that
happened
prior
to
the
300-day
filing?
that's
my...
sort
of
the
basic
question
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
injury
would
not
be
enough.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
arguably
it
would
be
in
this
case
to
the
extent
the
hostile
environment
claim
is
a
continuing
violation.
i
don't
know
whether
it
is,
but
arguably
that's...
the
hostile
environment
claim
conceivably
could
be
a
continuing
policy
also.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
my
assumption
is
a
case...
there
was
a
violation
all
along,
but
the...
the
charge
was
not
filed
within
300
days
of
the
commencement
of
a
continuing
violation.
the
question
i
have
in
the
back
of
my
mind
is,
could
there
be
recovery
for
the
portion
of
the
continuing
violation
that
was
more
than
300
days
old?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say
ongoing
violations
and
taking
my
hypothetical,
could
they
recover
for
damages
prior
to
the
300
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
my
hypothetical
it
would
be
limited
to
300
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you're
saying,
if
i
understand
it
correct,
is
the
promotion
is
a
discrete
violation
with
continuing
effects,
whereas
a
hostile
environment
is
a
continuing
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
two
quite
different
things.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
this
case--
