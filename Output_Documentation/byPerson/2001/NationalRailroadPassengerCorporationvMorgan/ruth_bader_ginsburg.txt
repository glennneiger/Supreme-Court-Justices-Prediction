bader

mr.
englert,
i'm
not
aware
that
there
is
a
case...
perhaps
i'm
wrong
about
this...
quite
like
this
where
there
are
a
succession
of
similar
acts,
a
number
of
disciplines,
a
number
of
refusal
to
give
training
opportunities,
and
the
employee
goes
to
the
eeo...
the
in-house
person,
tries
to
settle
it,
tries
not
to
make
a
federal
case
out
of
it.
and...
but
the
rule
that
you
would
have
us
adopt
would
say
if
you're
in
doubt,
sue
instead
of
saying,
if
you're
in
doubt...
each
one
of
these
discrete
instances
that
he
was
trying
to
work
out,
we
would
have
to
have...
your
rule
would
mean
that
this
person
has
to
file
10
charges
with
the
eeoc
instead
of
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he's
always...
he
also
has
the
in-house.
he's
got
a
conciliatory
process
going
without
involving
the
federal
government.
he's
just
dealing
with
his
employer.
his
employer
has
an
eeo
counselor.
that
he
did.
he
didn't
come
to
a
federal
agency.
so,
let's
take
it
that
we're
talking
about
the
eeoc
and
not
suing
in
court.
the
eeoc...
one
of
its
objections
is
you
would
be
breeding
tremendous
fragmentation
here
because
on
every
incident
in
a
pattern,
he'd
have
to
file
another
eeoc
charge.
that
much
you
are
saying.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
englert,
i
don't
think
that
this
is
in
any
case.
i
think
you
have
recognized
that
in
the
so-called
hostile
atmosphere
case,
the
first
epithet,
even
the
second,
it's...
it's
uncertain
when
how
much
is
enough
and
when
it's
insufficient.
so,
i
think
you
recognize
that
at
least
in
that
category
of
case,
there
would
have
to
be
a
succession
of
similar
incidents.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
englert,
you
have
been
deflected
from
what
i
think
is
the
strongest
point
on
the
other
side
that
said,
that's
all
well
and
good,
but
congress
understood
you
could
go
back
way
beyond
the
300
days
because
they
put
a
2-year
cap
on
back
pay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
that
shows
how,
whatever
you
might
say,
just
looking
at
the
words
of
the
statute,
congress
understood
that
you
have
to
shorten
the
period
and
the
period
they
picked
was
2
years,
much
longer
than
180
days
or
300.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
agency
here...
i
mean,
that's...
the
position
that
you
are
taking,
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
differs
from
the
eeoc's
position
which,
i
understand
it,
is
the
position
that
the
ninth
circuit
followed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
is
the
eeoc's
position
on...
on
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
your
answer
to
the
question
about
the
2
years
is
that
there
are
cases.
there
wouldn't
be
very
many,
though,
that
would
fit
where
would
be
a
2-year...
possibility
of
a
2-year
back
pay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
agree
with
those
equitable...
whatever
those
equitable
tolling
reasons
were?
you
think
those
courts
handled
the
case
correctly?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
would
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
say
that
for
compensatory
damages
you
rely
on
the
lid
in
dollar
amount.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
back
pay
time.
but
i
take
it
your
argument
would
be
no
different
if
there
were
no
ceiling
on
the
amount
you
could
get
for
compensatory
or
punitive
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
certain
because
if
it
is
a
truly
continuing
violation...
every
promotion,
every...
every
training
i
ask
for
is
going
to
be
denied...
it
will
never
end.
it's
going
on.
at
some
point
there's
going
to
be
a
suit.
so,
the
last
act
is
just
the
last
act
that
happens
before
the
employee
decided
to
bring
the
suit.
the
very
nature
of
the
continuing
thing,
it's
going
to
go
on.
hopefully
the...
the
charge
will
stop
it.
but
it's...
the
last
act
is
the
one
that
the
complainant
would
pick.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
your
basic
position
is
these
filing
periods
are
like
a
statute
of
limitations
in
some
respects
but
not
in
other
respects.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
the
45
days
that
you
have
if
you're
a
government
employee
to
start
consulting
in
your
own
house.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of...
one
of
the
peculiarities
is
the
difference
between
180-day
and
300
which
makes
very
good
sense
as
far
as
administrative
exhaustion
is
concerned.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as...
why
should
the
person
who's
in
a
deferral
state
get
300
days
while
the
person
who's
not
get
only
180
days
if
we're
talking
about
a
statute
of
limitations
as
measuring
the
ripeness
or
staleness
of
a
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
some
confusion
in
the...
you
are
referring
not
to
the
eeoc
charge
that
didn't
come
to
till
the
end
of
the
line,
but
the
eeo
charges
that
he
filed
in-house.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
what
you're
saying
he
did
earlier.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
some
it's
300
days,
for
some
it's
180.
how
many
states
are
so-called
deferral
states
where
people
would
get
the
benefit
of
the
300
days
rather
than
the
180?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
that
would
be
a
very
odd
statute
of
limitations
to
say,
depending
on
your...
the
state
that
you're
in,
you
get
180
days
or
300
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
englert
said
that
the
limitation,
the
2-year
limitation...
that's
because
congress
was
reacting
to
a
time
when
there
was
no
limitation
and
there
were
fears
that
you'd
have
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
1965.
so,
they
set
2
years.
if
they
had
understood
properly
what
was
going
to
be
the
effect
of
180
days,
which
wasn't
determined
till
much
later,
then
they
would
have
realized
that
there
was...
they
fixed
something
that...
where
there
was
nothing
broken.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
recognize
that
you
can't
turn
every
discrete
act
into
a
continuing
violation.
i
mean,
it
must
be
used.
you
have
conceded
that
the
one-time
thing...
you're
not
getting
this
promotion,
you're
discharged.
how
does
one
tell...
and
here...
here
there
were
several
similar
acts...
whether
it's
a
discrete
violation
on
the
one
hand
or
whether
it's
a
continuing
violation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
the
difference
between
your
position
and
the
government's?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
explain
the
logic
in
statute
of
limitations
terms
between
giving
some
people
300
and
others
180?
