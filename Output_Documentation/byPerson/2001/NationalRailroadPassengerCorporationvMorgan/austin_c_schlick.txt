mr.
austin
c.
schlick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
decision
in
zipes
established
and
the
court
reaffirmed
in
lorance
that
section
706(e)
operates
as
a
statute
of
limitations.
the
limitations
period
begins
to
run
with
the
occurrence
of
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice.
in
this
case,
respondent
could
sue
on
alleged
violations
that
occurred
not
more
than
300
days
before
he
filed
his
charge
with
eeoc,
but
he
could
not
sue
on
alleged
violations
that
occurred
earlier
and
outside
the
limitations
period.
our
construction
of
section
706(e)
gives
effect
to
the
balance
underlying
that
provision.
on
the
one
hand,
it
ensures
that
plaintiffs
are
able
to
sue
and
recover
for
ongoing
violations.
at
the
same
time,
it
ensures
that
employers
will
not
be
liable
for
violations
that...
that
occurred
long
ago.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
stevens,
recovery
would
only
be
available
if
equitable
tolling
came
into
play.
as...
absent
equitable
tolling
based
on...
based
on
the
conceal...
equitable
estoppel
based
on
the
concealment
that
you
mentioned
in
your
hypothetical,
recovery
would
be
limited
to
300
days.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes,
justice
stevens.
the
fact
that
it
was
continuing
would
not...
would
not
affect
the
application
of
a
300-day
period.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes,
justice
o'connor.
there
were
two
categories
of
claims
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
first
is
what
ninth
circuit
referred
to
as
serial
violations,
that
is,
independently
actionable
alleged
violations
of
title
vii.
and
as
to...
as
to
those
claims,
the
ninth
circuit
went
wrong
in
holding
that
violations
that
occurred...
that
accrued
more
than
300
days
before
the...
the
charge
was
filed
were
actionable.
the
second
claim
was
a
hostile
work
environment
claim.
now,
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
and
the
claims
at
trial
were
that
the
hostile
work
environment
became
actionable
right
from
the
outset
of
mr.
morgan's
employment
with...
with
amtrak.
it
was
actionable
throughout
the
period.
mr.
morgan,
however,
didn't
bring
a
charge
on
that...
on
that
claim
until
years
later.
accordingly,
he
could
only
recover
for
300
days
of
the
alleged
maintenance
of
the
hostile
work
environment.
now,
our
construction--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--no.
although
evidence
says
that
events
outside
the
limitations
period
are
admissible
as
background
evidence,
our
view
of
the
continuing
violation
doctrine
is
that
it
allows
a
plaintiff
to
sue
notwithstanding
that
there
may
have
been
notice
of...
of
similar
violations
outside
the
limitations
period.
and
that's
the
application
of
the
continuing
violation
doctrine--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--suit...
suit
could
be
brought
within
300
days
for
the
entirety
provided
that
it
accrued
within
the
300
days.
and
the...
the
relevance
of
the
continuing
violation
rule
is
that
notice
outside
the
limitations
period...
in
this
case
going
back
to
the
serial
claims,
in
this
case
notice
of
related
violations
outside
the
limitations
period
do
not
prevent
mr.
morgan
for
suing
on
violations
that
occurred
within
the
limitations
period.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
when
you
say
commenced,
i
understand
you
to
mean
accrued.
it
became
actionable.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that,
justice
breyer,
is
the
question
of
accrual
under
harris.
the...
the
standard
for
the
claim
in
that
case
would
be
whether
the
work
environment...
the...
was
severe
and
pervasive
both
objectively
and
subjectively.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
the...
the
reasonableness
that
would
allow...
that
would
extend
the
limitations
period
is...
is
reasonableness
that
would
qualify
under
the
equitable
tolling
or
equitable
estoppel
doctrines.
and
indeed,
the
limitations
period
is
sometimes
extended
even
beyond
2
years,
thereby
giving
effect
to
the
2-year
restriction
on
back
pay
under
the
equitable
tolling
doctrine.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
correct,
and
if
it's
a
reason
which
does
not--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--the
result
of
the
seventh
circuit's
test
is
generally
consistent
with
our
rule,
but
the...
the
seventh
circuit's
test
is
in
our
view
less
definite
than
our
own.
they
seem
to
ask
whether
the
plaintiff
sued
at
an
appropriate
time.
our
question
is,
did
the
plaintiff
bring
suit
within...
or
file
a
charge,
rather,
within
300
days
or
180
days,
if
applicable,
of
the
accrual
of
the
violation,
of
the
occurrence
of
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice.
and
that
is
the
rule
established
in
the
nlra,
which
is
the
model
for
title
vii.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
the
respondent
and
amici
rely
on
regulations
issued
by
the
eeoc
under
section
717
of
the
act,
which
is
the
federal
employer
provision.
those
regulations
are
by
their
terms
inapplicable
to
claims
under
706,
and
indeed,
congress
left
it
to
the
eeoc
to
establish
a...
a
framework
for...
for
filing
charges
that
the
eeoc
requires
consultation
within
45
days
with
the
agency's
eeo
office.
so,
it's
a
different
structure,
and
in
that
context--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--in
section
706
cases,
respondent
correctly
points
out
that
the
eeoc
has
filed
briefs
and
taken
a
position
which
is
consistent
with
the
ninth
circuit's
test.
our
view
is
that
while
that
would
be
evaluated
under
skidmore,
it
is
not
persuasive
for
the
views
that
we've
given
in
our
brief.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
i
can
give
you
two
cases
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york
last
year,
sye
v.
the
rockefeller
university,
137
f.
supp.
2d
276;
bardniak
v.
cushman
and
wakefield,
2001
wl
1505501,
both
last
year.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
charge
was
filed
3
years
after
the
last
occurrence
that's
alleged
and
applying
equitable
tolling
principles,
the
courts
indicated
that
the...
that
the
complaint
could
go
forward
because
of
the
equitable
tolling.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes.
i
think
so.
in
both
cases,
misinformation
was
provided
by
the
agency,
either
the
state
agency
or
the
eeoc
itself.
in
one
case
there
was
a
question
of
mental...
mental
incapacity
of
the
plaintiff,
and
tolling
was
additionally
extended
on
that
basis.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
in
our
view
hostile
environment
cases
are
not
unique
and
are
not
properly
exceptions
in
which...
in
which
a
continuing
violation
doctrine
apply.
rather
it's
a
question
of
accrual,
and
hostile
environment
cases
are
distinguishable
in
that
they
may
take
a
long
time
to
accrue.
but
that
simply
means
that
when
they
do
accrue,
the
charge
should
be
brought
within
300
days.
the
example
of...
of
a
discharge
would
be--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--if
i
may
answer,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
in
that
case
there
is
an
occurrence
within
the
300
days
and
it's
that
occurrence
that
is
the
basis
for
the
charge
and
the
complaint
within
the
300
days.
