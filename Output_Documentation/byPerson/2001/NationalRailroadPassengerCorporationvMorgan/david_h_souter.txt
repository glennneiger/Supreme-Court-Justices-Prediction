justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
that's
the
case,
you
don't
have
to
concede
anything
because
the
hostile
environment
doesn't
occur,
as
you're
analyzing
it,
until...
within
the
300-day
period.
i
thought
what
you
meant
was
that
you
would
concede
the...
the
case...
you
would
concede
the
application
of
continuing
violation
when
the
hostile
environment
was
not
apparent
enough
to
bring
a
lawsuit
until
you
get
within
the
300-day
period...
yes,
the...
the
limitation
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
you're
saying
that...
i...
i
thought,
in
answer
to
justice
scalia,
you
were
saying
there
is
no
hostile
environment
prior
to
the
third
incident,
which
is
within
the
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
that
isn't
what
you
meant.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
how
i
understood
him.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then
the
hostile
environment
goes
back
beyond
the
300-day
period.
you're
saying
a
hostile
environment
began
with
the
first
epithet,
but
you
didn't
have
a...
a
sufficiently
obvious
indication
of
it
until
you
got
to
epithet
three.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
big
circuit.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
706(g)
would
still
apply
to
a
continuing
violation,
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
if
there's
a
continuing
violation,
you
think
it
wouldn't
apply
to
that
at
all.
maybe
not.
you
don't
think
706(g)
has
any
application
under...
under
the
petitioner's
theory.
