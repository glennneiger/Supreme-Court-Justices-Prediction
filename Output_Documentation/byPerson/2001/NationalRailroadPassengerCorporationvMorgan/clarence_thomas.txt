justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent
abner
morgan,
jr.
sued
petitioner,
national
railroad
passenger
corporation
(amtrak)
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
alleging
that
he
had
been
subjected
to
discrete
discriminatory
and
retaliatory
acts
and
had
experienced
a
racially
hostile
work
environment
throughout
his
employment.
section
2000e-5(e)(1)
requires
that
a
title
vii
plaintiff
file
a
charge
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
either
180
or
300
days
after
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice
occurred.
although
many
of
the
alleged
discriminatory
acts
that
make
up
morgan’s
respective
claims
fell
outside
of
the
statutory
time
period,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
morgan
could
sue
on
claims
that
would
otherwise
be
time-barred
so
long
as
they
were
either
sufficiently
related
to
incidents
that
fell
within
the
statutory
time
period
or
were
part
of
a
systematic
policy
or
practice
of
discrimination
that
took
place
at
least
in
part
within
the
limitations
period.
we
granted
certiorari
in
order
to
consider
whether
and
under
what
circumstances
a
title
vii
plaintiff
may
sue
on
these
acts.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
in
part
and
affirm
in
part.
because
the
statue
provides
that
a
litigant
must
file
the
charge
within
180
or
300
days
after
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice
occurred,
our
inquiry
focuses
on
when
the
unlawful
employment
practice
ends.
with
respect
to
discrete
acts,
the
unlawful
practice
is
typically
over
on
the
day
that
it
happened
and
the
statute
precludes
recovery
for
the
discrete
acts
of
discrimination
or
retaliation
that
occur
outside
the
statutory
time
period
regardless
of
whether
they
are
related
to
acts
inside
the
period.
hostile
work
environment
claims
however
occur
over
a
series
of
days
or
perhaps
years
and
indirect
contrast
to
discrete
acts,
a
single
act
of
harassment
may
not
be
actionable
on
its
own.
a
charge
alleging
a
hostile
environment
claim
will
not
be
time
barred
so
long
as
all
acts
which
constitute
the
claim
are
part
of
the
same
unlawful
employment
practice
and
at
least
one
act
falls
within
the
time
period.
neither
holding
however
precludes
a
court
from
applying
equitable
doctrines
that
toll
or
limit
the
time
period.
employers,
for
example,
may
raise
a
laches
claim
which
bars
the
plaintiff
from
maintaining
a
suit
if
he
unreasonably
delays
in
filing
and
as
a
result
harms
the
defendant.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
which
the
chief
justice
joins,
and
in
which
justices
scalia
and
kennedy
join
as
to
all
but
part
one,
and
in
which
justice
breyer
joins
as
to
part
one.
