day
o'connor
well,
mr.
englert,
there
are,
i
assume
even
in
your
view,
a
few
exceptions
to
this
rule.
when
is
it
that
you
would
look
back?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there's
no
other
circumstance,
you
think,
where
you
would
end
up
looking
back
beyond...
where
the...
the
full
thrust
of...
of
what
was
going
on
didn't
become
evident
until
the
statute
had
passed
as
some
early...
on
some
earlier
events?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this
a
hostile
environment
claim,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
in
the
case.
is
it
a
pattern
and
practice
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
could
be
a
hostile
environment
claim
included
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
a
nutshell,
where
do
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
went
wrong,
which
i
take
it
you
believe
is
the
case
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
seventh
circuit
has
adopted
the
right
test
in
that
regard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
price,
the
ninth
circuit,
whose
judgment
we're
reviewing
here,
as
nearly
as
i
can
tell
seems
to
take
a
different
view
of
what
can
be
included
for
damages
as
actionable
than
that
taken
by
other
circuits
that
have
looked
at
the
same
statute
and
the
same
problem.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
a
very
lopsided
split
really.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
there
are
separate
events
that
have
occurred
and
if
each
one
standing
alone
would
be
actionable
and
if
no
charge
is
filed
or
suit
brought
until
after
the
time
limit
established
for
some
of
the
violations,
what
do
we
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
acts
that
occurred
before
the
applicable
statutory
period
had
expired
were
actionable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
should
we
look
to
what
a
reasonable
person
should
be
expected
to
recognize
as
a
cause
of
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
shouldn't
be
any
objective
test
element
in
it?
