justice
john

those
mentally
retarded
persons
who
meet
the
law's
requirements
for
criminal
responsibility
should
be
tried
and
punished
when
they
commit
crime.
because
of
their
disabilities
in
areas
of
reasoning,
judgment
and
control
of
their
impulses,
however,
they
do
not
act
with
the
level
of
moral
culpability
that
charaterizes
the
most
serious
adult
criminal
conduct.
moreover,
their
impairments
can
jeopardize
the
reliability
and
fairness
of
capital
proceedings
against
mentally
retarded
defendants.
presumably,
for
these
reasons
in
the
thirteen
years
since
we
decided
the
case
of
penry
against
lynaugh,
the
american
public,
legislators,
scholars
and
judges
have
deliberated
over
the
question
whether
the
death
penalty
should
ever
be
imposed
on
a
mentally
retarted
criminal.
the
consensus
reflected
in
those
deliberations
informs
our
answer
to
the
question
presented
by
this
case:
whether
such
executions
are
"cruel
and
unusual
punishments"
prohibited
by
the
eighth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
this
cames
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
the
petitioner
daryl
atkins
was
convicted
of
a
particularly
brutal
crime,
a
capital
murder.
at
the
penalty
phase
of
his
trial,
an
expert
witness
testified
that
atkins
is
mentally
retarded.
the
expert's
conclusion
was
based
on
interviews
with
people
who
knew
atkins,
a
review
of
court
and
school
records
and
the
administration
of
a
standard
intelligence
test
that
indicated
that
he
has
an
iq
of
59.
the
jury
nevertheless
sentenced
him
to
death.
on
appeal
to
the
virginia
supreme
court,
atkins
argued
that
he
is
mentally
retarded
and
therefore
the
state
may
not
execute
him.
relying
on
our
holding
on
the
penry
case,
the
state
court
majority
over
the
dissent
of
two
members
of
the
court
rejected
this
contention
and
affirmed
the
sentence.
the
two
dissenters
argued
that
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
of
death
upon
a
criminal
defendant
who
has
the
mental
age
of
a
child
between
the
ages
of
9
and
12
is
accessive.
because
of
the
dramatic
shift
in
the
state
legislative
landscape
that
has
occured
in
the
past
13
years,
we
granted
certiorari
to
revisit
the
issue
that
we
first
addressed
in
penry.
we
now
hold
that
the
eighth
amendment
prohibition
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
categorically
forbids
the
execution
of
the
mentally
retarded.
our
analysis
begins
with
the
text
of
the
eighth
amendment
which
succinctly
prohibits
excessive
sanctions.
we
have
read
the
text
of
the
amendment
to
prohibit
all
excessive
punishment
as
well
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
that
may
or
may
not
be
excessive.
a
claim
that
punishment
is
excessive
is
judged
by
the
evolving
standards
of
decency
that
marked
the
progress
of
a
maturing
society.
this
inquiry
is
informed
by
objective
evidence,
most
notably
by
recent
legislative
enactments.
in
cases
in
which
a
consensus
among
the
states
has
emerged,
our
own
judgment
is
brought
to
bear
by
asking
whether
there
is
reason
to
disagree
with
the
judgment
reached
by
the
citizenry
and
its
legislators.
with
respect
to
state
legislation,
we
find
that
much
changed
in
the
13
years
since
we
decided
penry.
at
that
time,
only
two
states
had
specifically
addressed
the
precise
issue
and
forbidden
the
execution
of
the
mentally
retarded.
since
then,
however,
16
additional
states
have
adopted
the
ban.
in
other
states
bills
have
passed
at
least
one
house
of
the
legislature.
moreover,
in
states
that
allow
the
execution
of
the
mentally
retarded
the
practice
is
not
common.
prior
cases
teach
that
we
should
focus
our
attention
on
statutes
expressly
addressing
the
relevant
issue.
when
we
do
so
we
find
in
the
words
of
our
opinion
in
enmund
against
florida
that
there
is
unquestionably
consensus
in
the
judgment
of
the
legislatures
that
have
recently
addressed
the
matter.
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
agree
with
the
consensus
that
has
emerged.
the
number
of
states
that
have
addressed
the
issue
is
less
significant
than
the
consistency
of
their
enactments
and
the
direction
of
the
change.
given
the
well-known
fact
that
anti-crime
legislation
is
far
more
popular
than
legislation
providing
protections
for
persons
guilty
of
violent
crimes,
the
large
number
of
states
prohibiting
the
execution
of
mentally
retarded
person
and
the
complete
absence
of
states'
passing
legislation
reinstating
the
power
to
conduct
such
executions
provides
powerful
evidence
that
today
our
society
views
mentally
retarded
offender
as
categorically
less
culpable
than
the
average
criminal.
despite
repeated
dissents
from
members
of
the
court,
our
jurisprudence
has
consistently
confined
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
to
a
narrow
category
of
the
most
culpable
offenders.
the
mental
deficiencies
that
by
definition
characterize
the
mentally
retarded
categorically
remove
them
from
this
group.
executing
the
mentally
retarded
does
not
measurably
further
the
goal
of
deterrence,
moreover
there
is
reason
to
be
believe
that
the
reduced
capacity
of
mentally
retarded
offenders
means
that
they
face
a
special
risk
of
wrongful
execution.
in
sum,
construing
and
applying
the
eighth
amendment
in
light
of
out
evolving
standards
of
decency,
we
hold
that
the
constitution
places
a
substantive
restriction
on
the
stateâ€™s
power
to
take
the
life
of
mentally
retarded
offender.
as
we
did
in
ford
against
wainwright
with
respect
to
the
execution
of
the
insane,
we
leave
to
the
states
the
task
of
developing
appropriate
procedures
to
enforce
these
substantive
constitutional
restrictions.
the
judgment
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
scalia
and
thomas
have
joined
and
justice
scalia
will
announce
his
own
dissent.
