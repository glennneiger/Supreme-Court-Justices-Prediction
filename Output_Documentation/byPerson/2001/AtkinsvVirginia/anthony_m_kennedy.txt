well,
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
scalia's
basic
premise
that
it's
a
one-way
ratchet
is
correct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
links
up
to
the
consensus
problem
if
you
take
i
don't
think
a
poll
is
relevant,
but
a-
but
assuming
you
took
a
poll
and
since
you
execute
the
ret-
retarded,
i
think
most
people
would
have
in
in
in
mind
an
image
of
mental
retardation
which
doesn't
reflect
the
sophistication
of
the
dsm
which
talks
about
mild
retardation
and
defines
somebody
mi-
who's
mildly
retarded
as
educable
with
an
iq
of
maybe
as
high
as
s-
he-
e-
h-
i-
in
that
range
of
of
seventy
with
with
some
w-
with
some
room
for
statistical
error.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
are
they
subject
to
criminal
liability
at
all
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
nothing
wrong
with
putting
a
retarded
person
we
know
that
there's
a
problem
with
definition,
but
in
in
jail
for
life,
or
in
solitary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
position
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
is
that
you
can
execute
the
retarded.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
any
person
who
has
criminal
responsibility
can
be
executed
no
matter
how
retarded
they
are.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
i'd
like
to
get
the
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
myself
let's
assume.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
justice
souter
asked
the
question,
if
there
is
that
risk,
is
there
a
place
in
our
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
for
us
to
take
account
of
that
risk
and
draw
some
lines?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
asking
about,
and
and
jus-
justice
breyer's
question,
as
well
as
justice
souter's,
is
i-
i
think
must
recognize
the
premise
that
one
of
the
great
facts
of
life
in
american
government
is
legislative
inertia.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
i
did
not
have
a
chance
to
ask
petitioner's
counsel
because
his
rebuttal
time
was
running
up,
but
it's
important
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
same
as
the
general
population
or
higher?
