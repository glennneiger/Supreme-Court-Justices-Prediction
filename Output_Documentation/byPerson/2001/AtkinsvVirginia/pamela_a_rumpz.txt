ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
yes.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
yes,
the
retarded
individuals
who,
like
atkins,
were
found
competent
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
competent
at
the
time
of
to
assist
his
lawyers,
who
were
found
guilty
of
a
premeditated,
deliberated,
and
calculated
murder,
and
who...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
that
is
the
position
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
yes.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
exactly,
your
honor,
but...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
that,
exactly.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
the
dsm
tr
four
tr
recognizes
four
different
categories
of
mental
retardation.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
but
this
court
has
said
that
about
sixteen-year-olds
in
stanford.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
i
think
that
that
that
that's
an
a
p-
unlikely
to
happen.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
a
high
risk
cutoff
rule
of
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
follow...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
that's
what
individualized
sentencing
is.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
i
you
know,
i
i
don't
want
to
play
dumb
here,
justice
souter,
but
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
understanding
what
what
you're
asking
me.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
okay,
i'll
assume
that.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
no.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
this
case
is
a
perfect
illustration
of
the
first
point,
the
first
point
being
that
that
they
are.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
w-
w-
well,
i
i
i
think
that
that
the
fact
that
eighteen
states
have
done
so
in
the
last
thirteen
years
i-
i-
i-
it
doesn't
mean...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well,
that's
an
equally
good
assumption.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
don't
know
what
state
you...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
i
guess
my
answer
to
that
is
that
this
court
has
said
that
societal
consensuses
are
formed,
and
when
you're
looking
to
see
whether
there
is
a
societal
consensus,
you
look
to
the
statutes
that
the
that
the...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
or
there's
no
such
person
o-
person
on
death
row
who
was
not
competent
to
to
to
commit
his
crime,
was
not
competent
at
the
time
of
his
trial,
was
not...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
suspect
not.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i-
no,
there's
not.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well,
the
federal
death
penalty
information
center,
if
you
get
on
their
web
site,
says
that
since
penry
was
decided
in
nineteen
eighty-nine,
twenty-five
mentally...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
i
think
just
because
two
states
in
in
in
since
nineteen
eighty-nine
have
executed
mentally
retarded
offenders
doesn't
mean
that
there
aren't
mentally
retarded
offen-
retarded
offenders
in
the
pipeline
waiting
to
be
to
become
executed
or
waiting
to
go
through
their
appellate
process
or
or
coming
up
to
trial.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well,
i
i
guess
i'd
go
back
to
what
justice
scalia
said
in
one
of
his
opinions
is
that
that
may
very
well
just
be
that
juries
and
prosecutors
and
society
believes
that
the
death
penalty
ought
to
be
imposed
on
the
mentally
retarded
less
often.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
thirty.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
for
two
reasons.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
w-
even
given
that,
new
york
has
in
its
statute
specifically
that
people
who
commit
murders,
while
in
prison,
can
be
executed
even
if
they're
mentally
retarded.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well,
because
they
may
have
some
bearing
on
whether
there's
an
a
a
consensus
against
the
death
penalty
altogether.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well,
t-
i-
wisconsin
tomorrow
may
decide
to
adopt
a
death
penalty
statute,
and
if
they
do,
they'll
have
to
affirmatively
to
affirmatively
legislate
a
number
of
things.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
no.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
no.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
no.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
n-
i
i...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
that
spaziano
says
different.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
has
said
that
there're...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
that's
what
that's
what
this
court
said
in...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
yes...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
i
i'm
i
i
don't
know
that
that
reflects
that.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
this
court
looks
at
the
laws
and
the
application
of...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
is
exactly
right.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well,
i...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
that
we're
here
arguing
this
case
today
is
proof
that
juries
do,
in
fact,
give
the
death
penalty
to
mentally
retarded
people.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
and
the
fact
that
they
rarely
do,
like
i
said
earlier,
could
mean
that
juries
believe,
just
as
atkins'
team
believes,
that
it
sh-
i-
that
it
should
be
rarely
imposed.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
and
i
agree.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
this
court
has
said
previously
that
the
notions
of
other
countries
and
the
notions
of
other
lands
cannot
play
the
deciding
factor...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well,
i-
it
is
relevant
in
i-
as
justice
scalia
said
in
one
of
his
p-
opinions,
to
determine
whether
our
practice
is
a
historical
accident
or
not.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
of
th-
of
the
co-
of
the
of
the
planet
i-
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
and...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
it's
not
dispositive,
and
it
is
relevant
once
the
eighth
amendment
principle
has
already
been
established.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
you
don't.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
don't
know,
and
and
it
w-
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
i
i
i
couldn't...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
don't
know
and
it's
not
in
this
record
what
the
what
the
prison
population
of
mental
retarded
people...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
it
was
it
didn't
pass
the
house.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
passed
bicameral
legislature
virginia.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
don't...
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
don't
believe
it
was
voted
on.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
it's
a
pendulum
swing
one
way.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
b-
but
my
point
is
this
practice
has
been
allowed
since
the
bill
of
rights
was
adopted
in
seventeen
eighty-nine,
and
we
have
eighteen
states,
some
of
which
can't
decide
in
between
themselves
whether
the
mentally
retarded
should
or
shouldn't
be
executed,
with
an
average
age
of
five
years.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
i
i
i
think
there's
not
a
consensus,
first
of
all,
and
my
backup
position
is
if
there
is
a
consensus,
it
certainly
isn't
one
of
an
enduring
nature.
