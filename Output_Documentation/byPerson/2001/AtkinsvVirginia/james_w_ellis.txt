mr.
james
w.
ellis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
nineteen
eighty-nine,
this
court,
surveying
the
already
growing
evidence
from
a
variety
of
sources
that
the
people
of
this
country
oppose
the
execution
of
individuals
with
mental
retardation,
observed
that
that
growing
sentiment
might
someday
be
manifested
in
legislation,
particularly
by
the
states,
which
this
court
identified
as
the
sort
of
evidence
upon
which
it
typically
can
rely
in
eighth
amendment
cases.
the
evidence
is
now
clear
that
the
american
people
in
every
region
of
the
country
have
reached
a
consensus
on
that
question.
by
every
measurement
and
through
a
th-
course
of
legislative
enactments
that
is
literally
unprecedented
in
the
field
of
capital
punishment...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
mr.
chief
justice,
the
i
would
define
consensus,
and
this
court
has
discussed
it
in
various
terms
in
the
cases,
but
i
would
distill
from
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
described
it
that
it
is
when
the
american
people
have
reached
a
settled
judgment
based
on...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
a
mor-
yes,
mr.
james
w.
ellis
your
honor,
there
i-
there
has
never
been
a
suggestion
by
this
court
that
it
differentiates
among
states
with
regard
to
size,
and
yet
obviously
logically
if
if
an
an
if
a
collection
of
statutes
only
was
found
in
the
smallest
of
the
states
or
the
states
o-
of
a
single
particular
region,
it
would
cut
against
the
evidence
that
there
was
a
consensus.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
there's
a
particular
number
in
response
to
that.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
i'm
no-
i'm
not
submitting
on
the
basis
of
a
figure,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
you
should,
and
i
took
that
to
be
the
the
the
teaching
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
first
penry
case.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
it's
r-
it's
roughly
twelve.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
part
depends
on
how
vermont
is
counted,
but...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
there're
now
eighteen
states
as
compared
to
the
two
that
w-
that
were
on
the
books
or
were
about
to
go
on
the
books,
in
the
case
of
maryland,
when
this
court
decided
the
penry
case.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
a
number
of
them.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
i
i
guess
i
would
characterize,
justice
scalia,
the
the
statutes
not
as
having
concluded
that
the
practice
was
unconstitutional,
but
instead
that
it
was
unacceptable.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
leaves
your...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
i
i
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
they
have
not
reached
that
judgment.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
and
might've...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
the
the
discussion
in
the
l-
th-
t-
in
state
legislatures,
there
isn't
legislative
history
in
quite
the
way
there
is
in
congress,
where...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
deal
differ-
yeah
i
was
going
to
say
th-
this
must
be
a
source
of
substantial
disappointment.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
i
i
would
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
that
a-
as
the
court
has
said
in
various
ways
in
several
of
the
cases
that
the
that
the
proponents
of
the
view
that
there
is
a
consensus
bear
an
extraordinarily
heavy
burden
of
demonstration.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
this
court
has
not
had
had
occasion
to
address
that
in
particular.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
w-
n-
not
only
in
the
area
of
the
eighth
amendment
but
in
others
as
well.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
justice
o'connor,
they
vary
remarkably
little.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
i-
it
seems
to
me
that
the
states
would
be
free
to
define
mental
retardation
and,
as
i
say,
many
use
the
definition
they
already
have,
that
their
clinicians
are
accustomed
to
a-
so
long
as
the
definition
they
chose
carried
with
it
the
core
principles
of
the
definition
of
mental
retardation
that
this
court
discussed
in
penry,
that
is
to
say,
m-
a
measured
intelligence
in
the
bottom
i-
i-
two
percent
bul-
bu-
in
the
bottom
two
and
a
half
percent
of
the
population
or
two
standard
deviations
below
the
mean,
plus
an
impact
on
the
real
world
functioning
of
the
individual...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
with
regard
to
pr-
with
regard
to
details,
as
i
suggested
a
moment
ago,
the-
there
there
is
room
for
some
difference,
but
with
regard
to
the
core
principles,
which
i
take
to
be
at
the
center
of
y-
o-
o-
o-
of
your
question,
are
th-
we
describing
the
same
group
of
people...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
what
we've
discovered
in
the
states
is
that
they've
all
come
to
essentially
the
same
conclusion,
which
is
all
the
people
who
fall
within
the
aamr
or
dsm
four
t
r
definition
are
the
people
that
they
chose
to
protect.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
individuals
with
mental
retardation
yes,
your
honor
the-
there
ther-
other
than
parents
parents
i'd
put
aside
there
is,
i
think,
no
group
in
this
country
more
aware
of
the
variety
among
people
with
mental
retardation
and
the
levels
of
functioning
at
each
level
than
state
legislators.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
w-
o-
obviously,
in
our
w-
we
would
not
be
totally
disappointed
if
this
court
were
to
resolve
that
question,
but
the
the
the
the
likelihood
and
prospect
of
a
remand
obviously
would
inapprop-
be
an
appropriate
response
so
that
the
virginia
courts
who
did
not,
in
this
case,
have
before
them
mental
retardation
as
a
legal
question
that
was
going
to
decide
anything
it
was
simply
an
observation
in
the
course
of
making...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
i
i
i
think
maybe
the
th-
the
virginia
supreme
court's
chara-
i-
b-
decision
on
that
can
be
best
characterized
as
expressing
concern
as
to
whether
or
not
the
individual
in
this
case
mr.
atkins
had
mental
retardation
because
of
the
testimony
of
dr.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
in
in
our
view,
your
honor,
the
people
with
mental
retardation
who
have
both
that
intellectual
functioning
as
the
core
and
it
has
manifested
itself
in
their
life
throughout
their
life
those
individuals
in
our
view
lack
the
culpability
or
blame
worthiness
because
their
understanding
of
their
actions,
their
understanding
of
the
context
in
which
their
actions
took
place...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
they
are
subject
to
criminal
liability
because
it
isn't
our
contention
that
they,
for
example,
can't
tell
i-
e-
to
use
the
the
language
in
in
in
virginia's
defense
of
insanity,
that
they
can't
tell
right
from
wrong.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
n-
n-
no-
nothing
in
the
ruling
that
we
seek
here
would
preclude
the
state
from
imposing
the
most
serious
penalty
it
has
other
than
the
penalty
of
death.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
your
honor,
i
believe
you're
discus-
discussing
the
ford
i-
issue
with
regard
to
competence
to
be
executed?
i
read
the
ford
case
as
suggesting
that
whether
the
individual
had
mental
illness
or
mental
retardation,
if
if
that
individual
lacked
the
understanding
as
execution
w-
became
imminent,
that
they
w-
that
the
state
would
be
precluded
from
executing.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
th-
that
test,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
adequate
for
several
reasons.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
yes.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
in
any
of
these
states,
mr.
james
w.
ellis
i-
it
s-
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
it
is
not
because
because
under
our
system
of
capital
punishment,
as
it
has
been
shaped
by
the
decisions
by
this
court,
we
don't
say
that
the
death
penalty
is
available
for
everyone
who
can
be
punished.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
and
i
think
it's
untrue.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
s-
so,
what
we're
saying
in
in
in
response
to
to
to
to
your
question,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
a
person
who
commits
an
act
who
has
mental
retardation,
who
commits
an
act
which
is
subject
to
punishment,
does
so
within
the
scope
of
the
limitations
imposed
by
his
disability.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
the
principal
reason,
and
and
it
has
changed
a
little
bit
as
as
the
as
the
process
has
gone
on.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
and
and
as
i
said,
th-
the
principal
focus
is
on
the
understanding
of
people
of
what
the
limitations
imposed
on
people
with
mental
retardation
are
and
how
it
affects
they
th-
their
comprehension...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
it
it
it
is
it
is
that
their
understanding
of
the
wrongness
of
their
action
may
be
incomplete
and
in
a
sense
immature
in
the
same
way
or
in
a
parallel
way
at
least...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
and
and
and
that
was
the
point
i
was
adverting
to
w-
was
adverting
to
a
moment
ago,
that
the
principal
reason
is,
as
i've
suggested,
the
the
shared
understanding
of
the
diminished
culpability
of
people
with
mental
retardation.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
c-
counsel...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
he
clearly
can.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
that's
right.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
there
there
may
well
be
cases
in
which
that
would
be
effective
in
guarding
against
that
concern,
but
that
also
backs
into
the
problem
this
court
observed
in
penry,
which
is
in
a
case-by-case
determination,
particularly
in
cases
in
which
juries
are
making
the
decision,
the
mental
retardation
may
in
fact
be
a
two-edged
sword,
that
the
that
the
that
the
juror,
in
evaluating
whether
or
not
to
impose
the
penalty
of
death,
may
see
mental
retardation
not
only
as
a
mitigating
or
potentially
mitigating
factor,
but
it
may
also
see
it
as
tied
to
prospective
dangerousness.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
i-
is
is
is
is
the
difficulty
o-
of
case-by-case?
yes.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
it
it
is
but
unlike
mental
ill-
e-
i-
in
in
the
case
of
mental
illness,
unlike
mental
retardation,
there
has
not
been
a
manifestation
of
a
national
consensus,
either
in
legislation
or
elsewhere,
that
suggests
the
american
people
have...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
the
th-
the...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
w-
would
apply
to
other
defendants
who
don't
have
mental
retardation.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
but
but
they
are
not
so
closely
tied
to
the
defining
characteristics
of
a
class
as
they
are
here
to
have
produced
that...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
i
read
this
court's
cases
as
saying
that
they
will
th-
that
the
court
will
look
to
that
t-
that
in
prospective
cases
you
will
look
to
a
variety
of
forms
of
evidence,
but
that
any
proffer
of
evidence
of
a
consensus
which
does
not
have
substantial
and
ther-
in
one
case
a
discussion
of
recent
formulation
of
that
consensus
into
enactments
by
the
legislature
will
be
viewed
with
skepticism
or
impact
more...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
theoretically
there
there
could
be
twenty.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
we
we
cannot
be
sure
but
it
is
roughly
two
or
three,
yes.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
n-
not
by
itself.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
i
i'm
not
sure
that
that
that
we
could
conclude,
for
example,
that
people
in
the
states
that
don't
have
the
death
penalty
approve
its
imposition
or
if
they
adopted
a
death
penalty
would
include
within
the
scope...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
well,
the
that
is
that
is
another
way
i-
of
counting.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
and
and
our
position,
on
the
basis
of
what
has
happened
in
the
thirteen
years
since
penry,
is
that
the
consensus
that
was
then
emerging
is
now
manifest,
both
in
the
legislation
and
in
every
other
indicator
we
have
of
public
sentiment.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
i-
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
the
that
the
polling
information,
which
was
quite
scanty
then
and
is
now
quite
full,
as
suggested
in
the
aamr
amicus
brief
in
mccarver,
is
part
of
the
picture.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
and
increasingly
it
is.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
polls,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor
are
a
way
of
of
of
viewing
the
legislation,
of
seeing
whether
or
not
the
consensus
the
legislation
appears
to
reveal
is
in
fact...
mr.
james
w.
ellis
i
d-
i
don't
believe
i
i
i
i'm
trying
to
think
of
a
case
in
which
polling
has
played
a
part
in
the
trial
court,
and
and
i
believe
it
has
no-
i
w-
none
comes
to
mind.
mr.
james
w.
ellis
i'll
endeavor
to
answer
couple
of
the
questions
that
this
court
had
raised.
