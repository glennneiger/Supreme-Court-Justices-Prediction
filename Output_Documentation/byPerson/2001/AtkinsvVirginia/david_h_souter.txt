justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
reason?
i
mean,
you
you
in
in
responding
to
justice
scalia's
question,
you
you
point
out,
well,
these
people
pass
the
the
test
of
of
comprehension,
which
is
a
a
condition
of
culpability
for
execution.
justice
david
h.
souter
realize
that
that's
the
judgment
they're
reaching,
and
you
want
us
to
recognize
that
judgment
as
now
having
constitutional
significance.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
the
idea?
justice
david
h.
souter
say
the
same
thing
then
about
about
children,
about
young
people?
so
long
as
the
state
can
prove
the
premeditation,
the
deliberation,
the
the
other
requirements
of
of
of
mental
culpability,
let
them
be
executed.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
take
five-year-olds.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
believe
there
is
there
is
any
role
at
all
in
in
the
in
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence,
death
penalty
jurisprudence
i
guess,
for
for
general
rules
to
the
effect
that,
yes,
there
may
in
some
instances,
let's
say,
of
retardation
be
be
proof
of
that
would
at
least
be
enough
to
get
to
a
jury
on
premeditation
and
and
and
deliberation
and
so
on,
but
that
the
very
fact
of
of
retardation
makes
it
unlikely
in
most
cases
that
this
can
be
proven
and
makes
the
evidence
at
least
highly
debatable,
even
in
those
cases
that
get
to
a
jury?
and
therefore,
the
sensible
thing
to
do
in
order
to
avoid
a
high
risk
either
of
wrong
conviction
or
in
the
case
of
of
the
penalty
phase
a
a
high
risk
of
of
unsound
judgments
imposing
the
death
penalty,
there
ought
to
be
a
cutoff
point
of
some
sort.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
i'm
assuming
that
that,
sure,
there
are
cases
of
borderline
retardation
and
so
on
in
which
the
the
there
would
be
enough
evidence
to
get
to
a
jury
on
the
various
mental
elements
for
a
for
a
capital
sentencing.
justice
david
h.
souter
clear
that
within
the
category
of
those
who
ought
to
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty,
there
should
be
individual
assessment.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
assume
a-
an
an
even
simpler
assumption
is
that
they
were
executing
people.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
from
new
hampshire,
and
the
last
execution
was
in
thirty-eight
or
thirty-nine.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
accept
the
view
that
there
is
in
fact
an
evolutionary
element
in
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence,
that
in
fact
it
does
change
as
as
as
societal
notions
of
reasonableness
in
terms
of
cruelty...
justice
david
h.
souter
you
so
you
you
ac-
you
ac-
you
accept
that
as
the
framework
that
we
are
supposed
to
be
working
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
you
need
it
after
it's
been
established?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
i
thought.
