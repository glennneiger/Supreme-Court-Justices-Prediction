mr.
ellis,
what
about
this
very
case?
there
was
some
confusion,
but
the
virginia
supreme
court
seemed
to
doubt
that
this
person
would
qualify
as
mentally
retarded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
precisely
did
the
virginia
supreme
court
say
about
this
defendant
and...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ellis,
i
thought
that
you
had
said
something
different
in
your
brief,
and
it
was
that
people
in
this
class
have
diminished
capacity
when
it
comes
to
the
life
or
death
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
rumpz,
if
we
stayed
just
with
the
eighteen
plus
the
twelve
that
don't
have
the
death
penalty,
then
we
get
up
to
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
three-fifths
of
all
the
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
time
in
this
court
wasn't
all
that
long
ago
when
this
court
was
making
prospective
declarations
of
unconstitutionality,
this
case
and
all
future
cases,
not
past
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
y-
in
making
this
cruel
and
unusual
decision
this
is
an
issue
that's
come
up
before,
but
does
what
the
rest
of
the
world
thinks
about
e-
executing
the
mentally
retarded
does
should
that
have
any
relevance
at
all?
i
mean,
we
have,
since
the
time
we
said
we
don't
look
to
the
rest
of
the
world,
been
supporters
of
international
human
rights
tribunals
in
for
the
former
yugoslavia,
for
the
former
rwanda.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
asked
you
if
it
was
relevant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
relevant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ask
if
it
was
dispositive.
