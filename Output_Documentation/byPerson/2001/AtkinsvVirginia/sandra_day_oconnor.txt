should
we
not
look
at
legislative
enactments
as
the
surest
indicator
of
what
the
view
of
the
the
particular
state
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
looking
at
that,
where
do
we
stand
today?
we
have
how
many
states
have
no
death
penalty
at
all?
is
it...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
states
have
now
enacted
legislation
providing
that
a
retarded
person
may
not
suffer
the
death
penalty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
no
uniform
determination
of
when
someone
should
be
regarded
as
mentally
retarded.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
point
is
even
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
he-
it's
unconstitutional
to
execute
a
person
who's
mentally
retarded,
presumably
it
would
still
be
open
to
the
state
to
determine
whether
that
individual
is
mentally
retarded
under
the
state's
definition,
or
is
there
some
federal
definition
you're
asking
us
to
employ?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
be
the
same
as
for
executing
someone
with
a
mental
illness?
we
we
have
dealt
with
that,
and
and
with
the
level
of
comprehension
that
someone
must
have
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
who
has
mental
illness.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
test
not
adequate
here
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
all
cases
of
mental
illness
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
your
arguments
seem
to
be
equally
applicable
to
those
who
are
mentally
ill.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
reasons
you
put
forward
to
us
seem
to
me
remarkably
the
same.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
come
back
and
tell
us
how
we
know
when
there's
a
consensus.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
and...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
includes
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
try
this
another
way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
agree
that
if
there's
a
consensus,
then
the
eighth
amendment
would
bar
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
court
said
that
might,
indeed,
be
the
law
in
penry,
but
you
say
we
were
wrong
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
accept
the
notion
that
if
there
is
a
consensus
and
we
find
there
is,
that
that
answers
the
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
it
voted
on
in
the
house?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thought
it
wasn't
voted
on.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
there's
a
consensus
and
want
to
argue
it's
just
not
enduring?
or
what
is
it
you're...
