forty-eight
constituted
a...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
you
said
this
class
of
people
and
i'm
not
sure
you
meant
that
is
no
less
culpable
than
you
or
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
want
you
to
address,
a,
i've
tried
to
make
a
point
maybe
they
are
not
so
culpable
as
you
or
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
that
is
you
want
to
say
less
than
eighteen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
want
to
know
why
not
far
more
than
eighteen,
and
my
reason
for
that
is
that
in
of
the
remaining
twenty
see
there
are
two
states
that
have
executed
retarded
people,
and
they
account,
i
gather,
for
about
seven
percent
of
the
population.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
tried
bit
by
bit,
and
i-
most
of
them
are
in
these
states
and
then
some
of
them
are
have
iqs
of
seventy
or
over.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
leave
leave
it
at
this,
that
since
penry
