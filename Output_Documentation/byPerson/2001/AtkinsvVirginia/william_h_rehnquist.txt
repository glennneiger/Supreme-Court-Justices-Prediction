mr.

[inaudible]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
definition
of
a
consensus,
mr.
ellis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
i
tha-
that's
that's
a
f-
perfectly
sound
phrase,
but
how
do
we
go
about
figuring
out
when
that
occurs?
i
mean,
how
many
states
must
be
on
a
particular
side?
does
the
population
make
any
difference?
h-
how
about
those
factors?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
and
h-
how
m-
how
many
states
out
of
the
fifty
do
you
need,
do
you
think,
for
for
a
consensus?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
y-
o-
y-
you're
saying
there
is
a
consensus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
th-
this
goes
to
the
where
where
is
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
case
like
supposing
your
view
is
adopted,
the
state
charges
capital
murder.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
states
still
allow
the
execution
of
retarded?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
talking
about
polls
if
you're
talking
about
public
sentiment,
are
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
expect
if
people
feel
that
way,
it
would
it
would
be
manifested
in
legislation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
are
you
saying
that
somehow
polls
are
to
be
considered
in
addition
to
legislation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
polls
should
be
admitted
in
if
we're
going
to
talk
about
polls
as
contributing
to
this
discussion,
they
should
be
admitted
in
the
trial
court
and
subject
to
examination
by
the
other
side.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
m-
well
what
what
do
we
know,
ms.
rumpz,
about
the
situation
in
the
states,
the
eighteen
states
which
have
prohibited
the
execution
of
the
retarded?
w-
w-
had
they
just
gone
through
a
tremendous
number
of
retarded
executions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we-
well
do
we
kn-
is
there
any
anything
in
the
briefs
that
indicates
why
these
states
w-
passed
the
legislation
that
they
did?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
m-
may
rep-
represent
a
jury's
belief
that
it
is
a
mitigating
circumstance
of
such
force
that
they
should
be
spared
the
death
penalty.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

you,
