justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
not
a-
n-
not
all
of
those
eighteen
feel
so
strongly
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
execute
someone
with
reduced
mental
capacity
that
they
are
willing
to
apply
that
to
people
who've
already
been
sentenced.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
bespeak
such
a
such
an
intransigent
view
that
this
is
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
going
to
do
it
in
the
future.
justice
antonin
scalia
h-
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
know
that?
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ellis,
would
would
you
would
you
agree
i
you
know,
i'm
i'm
not
sure
assuming
i
agree
that
that
when
there
is
a
a
a
a
new
consensus
that
the
constitution
means
something
it
didn't
mean
before
the
constitution
means
that
new
thing,
assuming
i
agree
with
that,
you
you
must
agree
that
that
we
have
to
be
very
careful
about
finding
new
consensuses,
don't
you?
because
w-
we
can't
go
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
ellis,
logically
it
has
to
be
a
one-way
ratchet.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
what
about
our
ment-
i
what
about
our
mental
illness
cases
dealing
with
the
time
of
the
crime?
why
aren't
they
sufficient
to
indeed
excuse
somebody
who
couldn't
help
themself?
you're
you're
saying
these
people
can
help
themselves.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
wh-
i
mean,
they
have
to
have
known
that
what
they
were
doing
is
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
the
only
thing
that
bears
upon
culpability?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
but
those
rules
were
based
upon
the
fact
that
some
people
are
not
as
culpable.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
i
think
it's
totally
untrue.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel
is
not
able
to
bring
that
to
the
jury's
attention...
justice
antonin
scalia
and
say,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
i-
in
fact,
he
can
bring
mental
retardation
to
the
attention
of
the
jury
as
a
basis
for
the
j-
f-
for
the
jury's
deciding
not
to
execute
the
person,
c-
can
can
he
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
question
that
in
all
states
he
can
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you're
saying
the
jury
is
not
constitutionally
even
allowed
to
to
be
given
the
option.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
you
have
less
less
than
half
of
the
states
that
have
ca-
capital
punishment
make
an
exception
for
the
mentally
retarded,
and
you
say
that
that
constitutes
a...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
i
can
see
the
argument
that
there's
a
consensus
on
the
other
side
since
the
other
side
seems
to
be
in
the
majority,
but
you
say
less
than
half
represents
a
consensus.
justice
antonin
scalia
legislation,
and
and
we...
justice
antonin
scalia
we
also
said
in
penry
that
you
you
know
the
argument
was
made
to
us
that
there
was
an
emerging
consensus,
and
we
rejected
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
w-
you
would
not
say
no
matter
how
retarded.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
argue
that
five-year-olds
should
be
executed
if
if
they
have
deliberated
on
on
the
on
the
act
and
and
and
otherwise
the
state
can
prove
the
the
mental
element?
justice
antonin
scalia
miss
rumpz,
i
i
ma-
it's
a
hard
question
to
answer
because
i
guess
you
you
would
need
a
definition
of
what
constitutes
an
inappropriate
or
improper
death
penalty,
and
we
haven't
we
haven't
established
any
guidelines.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
not
a
proper
or
an
improper
death
death
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
those
states
were
executing
a
lot
of
retarded
people,
and
that's
why
the
laws
were
passed.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
position
i'm
in
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
very
few
executions
of
women
in
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
rarely
impose
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
most
of
the
world
would
not
execute
rocket
scientists.
justice
antonin
scalia
abolish
the
death...
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
to
be
a...
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't...
justice
antonin
scalia
it
only
goes
in
one
direction
at
a
time,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
filed
a
dissent
in
this
case
which
has
been
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
justice
thomas.
it
should
not
be
thought
that
this
case
involves
the
question
whether
mental
retardation
should
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
a
defendant
receives
the
death
penalty.
our
case
law
requires
that
the
sentencer
be
permitted
to
consider
it,
and
it
was
considered
in
the
present
case,
in
fact,
it
was
the
central
issue
at
the
sentencing
here.
but
the
jury
either
did
not
believe
that
the
defendant
was
retarded
--
there
was
conflicting
evidence
on
the
point
--
or
believe
that
if
he
was,
he
was
so
mildly
retarded
that
it
should
make
no
difference
in
the
sentence.
what
today’s
opinion
says
is
that
if
the
issue
of
retardation
is
decided
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
if
it
is
found
that
he
scores
59
on
state
scale
that
makes
60,
the
lowest
grade
for
non-retarded
he
cannot
receive
the
death
penalty
no
matter
how
many
people
he
tortured
to
death,
no
matter
how
much
the
jury
believes
he
knew
precisely
what
he
was
doing.
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
result.
under
this
court’s
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence,
a
punishment
is
cruel
and
unusual
if
it
falls
within
one
of
two
categories:
first,
punishment
that
would
have
been
considered
cruel
and
unusual
at
the
time
that
the
bill
of
rights
was
adopted,
and
second,
punishment
that
is
inconsistent
with
modern
standards
of
decency
as
evidenced
by
objective
indicia,
the
most
important
of
which
is
legislation
enacted
by
the
country’s
legislature.
as
to
the
first
of
these
two,
the
court
makes
no
pretense
that
execution
of
the
mildly
mental
retarded
would
have
been
considered
cruel
and
unusual
in
1791,
only
the
severely
retarded
were
spared
conviction
and
execution
then
as
they
are
now.
the
court
instead
believes
that
recent
state
legislation
evidences
a
national
consensus
against
execution
of
even
the
mildly
retarded.
the
court
extracts
this
national
consensus
from
the
fact
that
18
states,
less
than
half,
47%
to
be
precise
of
the
38
states
that
permit
capital
punishment
for
whom
the
issue
exists,
have
very
recently
enacted
legislation
barring
execution
of
the
mentally
retarded.
the
court
discerns
in
other
words
a
47%
consensus.
even
that
47%
figure
is
artificial.
one
of
the
states
that
numbers
among
the
18
does
permit
the
mentally
retarded
to
be
executed
for
murder
in
prison,
another
of
them
excuses
only
the
severely
retarded
and
11
of
the
18
states
that
the
court
relies
on
have
prohibited
execution
of
mentally
retarded
defendants
convicted
of
crimes
committed
after
the
effective
date
of
the
legislation.
those
who
are
already
on
death
row
or
consigned
there
before
the
statute’s
effective
date
or
even
in
those
states
using
the
date
of
the
crime
as
the
criterion
of
retroactivity,
those
tried
in
the
future
for
crimes
committed
murders
committed
years
ago
can
still
be
put
to
death.
that
is
not
a
statement
of
absolute
moral
repugnance,
but
one
of
current
preference
between
two
tolerable
approaches.
as
for
the
court’s
assertion
that
the
number
of
states
involved
in
the
consensus
is
not
as
significant
as
the
trend,
what
other
trend
could
there
possibly
have
been?
14
years
ago,
every
state
permitted
execution
of
the
mentally
retarded.
the
only
direction
in
which
there
could
have
been
a
trend
is
in
the
direction
of
forbidding
it
unless,
of
course
you
expect
states
to
reverse
course
within
the
short
period
of
14
years,
because
the
oldest
of
these
statutes
is
that
old.
in
other
words,
to
be
accurate
the
court’s
consistency
of
trend
point
should
be
recast
into
the
following
unimpressive
observation.
no
state
has
yet
undone
its
exemption
of
the
mentally
retarded
one
for
as
long
as
14
whole
years.
among
the
18
states,
as
i
mentioned
the
oldest
of
the
statutes
is
14
years
old,
five
were
enacted
last
year,
over
half
were
enacted
in
the
past
eight
years.
few
if
any
of
the
states
have
had
sufficient
experience
with
these
laws
to
know
whether
they
are
sensible
in
the
long
run
but
today’s
opinion
converts
those
experiments
into
permanent
and
inalterable
requirements.
beyond
the
empty
talk
of
a
national
consensus,
the
court
gives
us
a
brief
glimpse
of
what
really
underlies
today’s
decision.
the
constitution,
the
opinion
says
“contemplates
that
in
the
end
our
own
judgment
will
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
question
of
the
acceptability
of
the
death
penalty
under
the
eighth
amendment.”
the
unexpressed
reason
for
this
unexpressed
contemplation
of
the
constitution
is
presumably
that
really
good
lawyers
have
moral
sentiments
superior
to
those
of
the
common
herd,
whether
in
1791
or
today.
this
raw
assumption
of
power
explains,
of
course,
why
the
court
can
be
so
cavalier
about
the
evidence
of
consensus.
because
in
the
end
it
is
the
feelings
and
intuition
of
the
majority
of
the
justices
that
count,
the
perceptions
of
decency
or
penology
or
of
mercy
entertained
by
a
majority
of
the
small
and
unrepresentative
segment
of
our
society
that
sits
on
this
court.
the
court
makes
several
assertions
that
execution
of
the
mentally
retarded
is
irrational
because
it
does
not
advance
the
purposes
of
criminal
punishment.
those
assertions
are
mistaken
as
my
opinion
discusses.
in
the
last
analysis
that
is
relevant.
the
principal
question
is
who
is
to
decide
whether
execution
of
the
retarded
is
permissible
or
desirable,
the
justices
of
this
court
or
the
traditions
and
current
practices
of
the
american
people.
today’s
opinion
says
very
clearly
the
form.
today’s
decision
promises
to
be
very
effective
in
turning
the
process
of
capital
trial
into
a
game.
one
need
only
read
the
definitions
of
mental
retardation
adopted
by
the
american
association
of
mental
retardation
and
the
american
psychiatric
association
which
are
set
forth
in
the
court’s
opinion
to
realize
that
the
symptoms
of
this
condition
can
readily
be
feigned.
and
whereas
the
capital
defendant
who
feigns
insanity
and
other
basis
for
being
excused
from
that
punishment,
whereas
the
capital
defendant
who
feigns
insanity
risks
commitment
to
a
mental
institution
until
he
can
be
cured
and
then
tried
and
executed.
the
capital
defendant
who
feigns
mental
retardation
risks
nothing
at
all.
to
my
mind
nothing
has
changed
the
accuracy
of
matthew
hale’s
endorsement
of
the
common
law’s
traditional
method
for
taking
account
of
guilt-reducing
factors
written
over
three
centuries
ago.
“determination
of
a
person’s
incapacity
due
to
insanity
or
mental
retardation
is
a
matter
of
great
difficulty;
partly
from
the
easiness
of
counterfeiting
this
disability
and
partly
from
the
variety
of
the
degrees
of
this
infirmity
whereof
some
are
sufficient
and
some
are
insufficient
to
excuse
persons
in
capital
offenses,
yet
the
law
of
england
had
afforded
the
best
method
of
trial
that
is
possible.
of
this
and
all
other
matters
of
fact
namely
by
a
jury
of
12
men
all
concurring
in
the
same
judgment
by
the
testimony
of
witnesses
and
by
the
inspection
and
direction
of
the
judge."
there
is
nothing
in
the
eighth
amendment
that
requires
the
american
people
to
abandon
this
century’s
old
common
law
practice
if
they
wish
as
the
statistics
indicate
they
do
wish
to
retain
it.
