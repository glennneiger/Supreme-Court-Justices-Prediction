argument
now
on
number
oh
one
seven
fourteen,
utah
versus
donald
l
evans,
secretary
of
commerce.
mr.
lee.
[inaudible]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
no
incentive
to
bring
a
challenge
until
you
know
that
you
are
losing
a
congressional
seat,
i...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
bind
the
parties
in
a
certain
extent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
only
have
a
certain
amount
of
time,
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
confirm
it
but
i-
is
isn't
it
a
permissible
inference
for
the
census
takers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
lee,
that
the
census
bureau
goes
about
this
thing
in
in
a
way,
s-
say
supposing
you
have
a
lake
in
northern
wisconsin
where
the
temperatures
get
down
to
about
forty
below
in
the
winter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
about
a
house
where
they
have
not
been
able
to
find
anybody
to
talk
to,
no
returns
sent
back,
so
they
go
to
the
people
next
door
and
they
say
is
there
anybody
living
in
that
house
and
the
person
next
door
says
yes,
there
are
two
people.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can't
bring
a
suit
before
you
know
what
what's
going
on.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
law
provide
for
some
sort
of
administrative
hearing
be-
before
the
census
bureau,
some
sort
of
an
exhaustion
requirement?
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
suggesting.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
bu-
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
the
bureau,
i-
i-
i-
is
is
that
well
publicized?
is
there
some
person
you
can
go
to
in
the
bureau
and
say
i
don't
like
what
youre
doing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
what,
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dellinger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
heads
of
household
have
been
used
as
proxies.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
doesn't
seem
too
statistical
sir.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
surely
the
term
actual,
though,
before
the
word
enumeration,
is
narrows
the
idea
the
the
enum-
,
what
might
otherwise
be
an
enumeration.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
if
if
another,
if
the
next
president
comes
along,
we
have
another
case
like
this,
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
next
president
tells
his
solicitor
general,
i
will
not
accept
it,
then
we
come
out
differently.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
by
two
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-714
utah
against
evans
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
