mr.
thomas
r.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
for
most
of
the
history
of
the
census
of
the
american
population,
that
census
has
been
conducted
by
means
of
an
actual
count
unaltered
by
any
methods
of
statistical
estimation.
at
the
time
of
the
first
census
of
seventeen
ninety,
james
madison
noted
that
this
was
the
way
required
by
the
constitution
and
ever
since
then,
that
requirement
is
employ-
been
implemented
by
congress
in
the
census
act.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
census
bureau
acted
unlawfully
in
departing
from
that
longstanding
historical
tradition
by
using
the
method
of
estimation
called
hot-deck
imputation
in
the
two
thousand
apportionment
count.
ninety-nine
point
six
percent
of
the
two
thousand
apportionment
count
was
comprised
of
actual
data
compiled
by
census
enumerators
in
two
phases.
first,
a
mailing
sent
to
all
addresses
on
a
master
address
file,
and
second,
as
many
as
six
follow-up
visits.
imputation
added
an
additional
point
four
percent
to
that
count,
one
point
two
million
statistically
generated
persons
were
added
to
the
apportionment
count
by
means
of
a
statistical
estimate.
th-
the
basic
essence
of
the
estimate
was
to
say
the
six
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
addresses
that
the
census
bureau
was
unable
to
enumerate
are
assumed
to
have
estimated
to
have
the
same
number
of
occupants
as
their
next
door
neighbor...
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
i
i
suppose,
justice
o'connor,
that
there
are
two
aspects
of
your
question
if
i'm
understanding
it.
one
of
them
would
be
a
a
redressability
standing
question.
that's
a
question
as
the
solicitor
general
notes
that
has
already
been
decided
by
this
court
both
in
franklin
and
in
montana...
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
with
regard
to...
well,
there's...
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
it
it
would
have
been
impossible,
justice
o'connor,
for
utah
to
have
brought
a
challenge
prior
to
the
census.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
we
wouldn't
have
had
an
injury,
and
in
fact
as
the
census
bureau
itself
indicates,
there
would
have
been
no
way
even
to
have
anticipated
that
imputation
would
have
had
this...
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
the
that
was
,
the
the
time
line
is
that
the
secretary
must
submit
the
numbers
by
the
end
of
the
calendar
year
to
the
president,
and
then
the
president
must
submit
those
numbers
within
seven
days
after
the
first
day
of
of
the
congress.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
the
remedy
that
we're
asking
for,
justice
kennedy,
is
simply
a
declaration
and
an
injunction
to
the
secretary
of
commerce
directing
the
secretary
to
issue
a
new
apportionment
count
free
of
the
statistical
estimates
that
we
believe
are
unlawful
under
the
census
act
and
under
the
census
clause
of
the
constitution.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
and
i
think,
justice
souter,
that's
effectively
north
carolina's
argument.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
and
and
the
other
opinion
in
that
case,
justice
souter,
that
also
addresses
this
issue
was
justice
stevens'
concurring
opinion,
for
a
separate
four-justice
concurrence
on
this
issue,
and
his
analysis
was
in
fact
that
the
statute
would
require
the
president
to
conform
to
a
revised
count
that
the
secretary
might
present
in
conformity
to...
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
the
other
point
that
justice
stevens
made
in
his
concurring
opinion,
justice
souter,
which
i
think
is
critical
on
this
issue,
is
that
the
time
deadlines
under
the
statute
can
be
understood
only
to
trigger,
o-
o-
only
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
ripeness.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
yeah.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
well,
the,
the
the
order
would
go
to
the
secretary.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
well,
i
i
believe
it's
franklin,
justice
kennedy...
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
well
the
the...
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
w-
one
understanding
consistent
with
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
franklin
would
be
that
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
and
i
think
that
that's
consistent
again
with
with
justice
o'connor's
plurality
opinion
in
franklin.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
well,
justice
scalia,
but
i
think
there
are
two
alternative
theories.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
that's
exactly...
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
the
final
step,
justice
ginsburg,
in
this
process,
is
for
the
clerk
of
the
house
of
representatives
to
forward
to
the
states
a
certificate
that
shows
how
many
seats
in
the
house
of
representatives
they're
entitled
to
after
the
clerk
receives
the
revised
numbers
from
the
president.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
well,
the
the
actual
enumeration
clause
of
the
constitution
would
require
an
actual
count,
and...
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
yes,
they
do,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
are
lights
on
and
and
cars
there
doesn't
tell
us
that
this
is
anyone's
usual
place
of
residence.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
well,
at
some
point
a
census
taker
may
make
a
conclusion,
if
it's
based
on
information
specific
to
an
individual
household,
may
make
a
conclusion
that
a
household
is
in
fact
occupied.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
justice
souter,
they
they
don't
start
out
with
a
proposition
that
this
is
a
house
and
somebody
lives
there.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
not
necessarily,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
i
i
don't
have
that
number
handy
off
the
top
of
my
head,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
no.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
i
think
not.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
the-
they
cannot,
justice...
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
no.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
well
then
i
suppose
i
suppose
under
those
circumstances,
then
we'd
have...
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
no.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
i
i
think
it's
important,
though,
to
to
answer
your
question,
justice
breyer,
to
to
go
back
to
the
baseline
of
the
house
of
representatives
decision.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
well,
i-
if
they
know
that
there's
somebody
who's
living
there,
they
have
to
find
out
whether
the
somebody
who's
living
there
lives
there
as
as
his
usual
place
of
residence,
or
that
person
doesn't
count
in
the
apportionment
count.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
our
position
is,
justice
kennedy,
that
any
method
that
takes
information
from
a
part
of
the
population
to
make
an
inference
about
the
whole
is
a
is
a
method
of
sampling
and
is
prohibited.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
it
it
it's
called
the
method
of
of
quality
assurance,
and
i-
at
the
quality
assurance
phra-
phase,
what
the
bureau
does
is
to
randomly
send
out
enumerators
to
given
census
tracts
to
try
to
find
the
tracts
where
there
are
a
large
number
of
errors,
where
the
enumerators
may
have
made
a
lot
of
mistakes.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
that
is
permissible
under
our
theory.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
well,
there
may
be
another
way
to
to
get
there,
justice
kennedy,
but
my
understanding
under
the
statute
is
that
section
one
ninety-five
prohibits
the
statistical
method
known
as
sampling.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
i-
in
fact,
justice
souter,
that
is
not
a
distinction.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
but
justice
souter,
once
you
pool
all
of
the
individual
housing
units
together,
the
six
hundred
and
twenty
th-
seven
six
hundred
and
twenty
thousand,
rather,
of
these
housing
units
that
were
used
to
estimate
the
six
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
addresses
that
we
know
nothing
about
after
six
follow-up
visits,
that's
your
sample.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
mathematically
it
seems
to
me,
though,
justice
souter,
we
get
to
the
same
end.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
it
it
is
also
true,
however,
justice
souter,
of
the
method
struck
down
by
this
court
in
the
house
of
representatives
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
that's
correct,
because
some
of...
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
well,
ordinarily,
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
the
nearest
neighbor
address
that's
used
to
estimate
or
impute
the
address
about
which
we
know
nothing.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
that's
exactly
right
and
and
of
course
the
scale
of
the
practice
is
beside
the
point.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
well,
justice
breyer,
let
me
mention
two
reasons
why
that
distinction
doesn't
get
them
anywhere.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
the
the
problem
with
the
distinction
is,
another
problem
with
the
distinction
is
that
it's
clear
that
it
would
permit
the
census
bureau
to
replicate
the
nineteen
ninety-seven
plan.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
yeah
m-
maybe,
justice
scalia
and
justice
breyer,
maybe
i
missed
the
pizza
man
example,
but
but
that
may
well,
the
that
may
well
be
a
a
a
distinction.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
that's
precisely
right,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
a-
actually
not,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
i
i'm...
mr.
thomas
r.
lee
yeah,
i
i
i
don't
believe
that
was
an
issue
in
that
case,
first
of
all,
justice
o'connor.
