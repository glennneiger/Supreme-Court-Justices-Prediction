mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
may
it
please
the
court,
because
north
carolina
believes
s-
very
strongly
that
the
right
time
to
challenge
the
census
bureau's
planned
use
of
a
statistical
method
is
before
rather
than
after
the
census
is
completed,
and
let
me
begin...
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
under
your
decision
in
house
of
representatives,
i
think
on...
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
three
thirty-two,
you
note
that
citizens
of
utah,
you
didn't
specify
the
state,
but
citizens
who
anticipate
that
the
use
of
a
method
like
imputation,
as
suburbanites
might,
would
dilute
their
intrastate
districting
representation,
are
specifically
said
in
house
of
representatives
to
have
authority
to
bring
that
suit.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
you
can,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
correct,
if
a
state
is
unable
to
show,
does
not
have
the
experts
about
a
forthcoming
census
that
is
unable
to
demonstrate
that
it
will
be
aggrieved.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
they
are
now,
but
my
point
is
that
if
utah
had
been
watching
this
carefully,
and
as
you
know,
many
states
were
involved
in
the
ninety-seven
litigation
as
amici
and
otherwise.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
understand...
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
i-
i-
e-
i-
exactly
correct,
but
that
it's
it's
exactly
why
any
governor,
major
city
mayor
or
others,
these
citizens,
that
those
who
brought
suit
in
nineteen
ninety-seven
and
did
not
include
this,
i-
suburbanites
are
going
to
hurt,
would
want
to
sue,
could
bring
the
suit,
but
in
any
event,
they
could
also
participate
in
the
bureau's
process.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
and
that
suit
allows
aggrieved
parties
to
bring
suit
when
the
census
produces
its
plan.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that's
exactly
how
it
worked
in
house
of
representatives,
if
you
do
that
plan,
we
expect
that
our
district
will
be
diluted.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
breyer,
those
who
sued
in
the
house
of
representatives
litigation
had
a
very
thin
basis
for
knowing
that
they
would
be
adversely
affected.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i...
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
and
here's
why.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
a
very
helpful
answer,
and
that
is
not
a
very
helpful
suggestion.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
oh,
at
this
stage?
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
o'connor,
that
is
a
very
good
question.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
it...
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
it
is
a
statistical
method
a-
by
which
you
take,
when
you
have
a
known
established
household
address,
the
information
from
the
you
know
basically
the
next
door
neighbor,
somewhat
refined,
justice
o'connor,
d-
the
the
next
door
neighbor
that
was
a
nonresponding
household
of
a
similar
type
and
they
found
over
the
years
that
that
information
is
more
reliable
than
zero.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
imputes
only
to
known
addresses.
