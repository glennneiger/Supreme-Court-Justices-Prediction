mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
we
agree
that
it
is
a
statistical
methodology,
justice
kennedy,
and
it's
very
important
in
that
context
to
focus
on
the
words
of
the
statute.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
it
does
not
say
that.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
yes,
i
think
that's
an
extension
of
it.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
the
space
and
impute
it
im-
impute
the
size
of
the
space...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
by
the
book
that
is...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that's
that's
was
the
way
it
was
done
in
seventeen
ninety.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it's
it's
not
necessarily
t-
statistical.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
it
well
it...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
justice
o'connor,
the
expert
agency
to
which
congress
delegated
this
broad
authority
doesn't
believe
so.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
imputation
is
distinguishable
from
cold-deck
imputation
in
the
sense
that
information
from
the
most
current
census
and
the
actual
neighborhood,
the
most
current
available
information
for
the
actual
census
that's
being
developed
is
being
used.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
they
have
but
well,
they
have
what
this
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
in
the
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
in
the
wisconsin
case
six
years
ago,
the
court
said
substantial
deference
should
be
owed
to
the
agency.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
but
the
reasoning
of
the
court,
i
would
submit,
is...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
justice
scalia,
and
and
not
only
the
wisconsin
case,
but
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
considered
census
have
suggested
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
by
using
the
word
enumeration
didn't
mean
a
particular
method
by
which
the
census
would
be
conducted,
nor
did
it
wish
to
constrain
both
the
congress
and
to
whom
whom
whomever
the
congress
may
delegate...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
presumably.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that
and
this
is
not
remotely
sampling...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
this
is
not
remotely
estimation.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
in
each
of
these
cases,
justice
scalia,
the
words
can
be
changed
and
and
added
to,
but
the
process
that
by
which
the
framers
analyzed
this
in
the
in
the
f-
in
when
framing
the
constitution,
the
very
first
house
of
representatives
was
assigned
according
to
an
estimation,
and
the
words
actual
enumeration
were
used
e-
to
compare
an
actual
count,
an
effort
to
find
the
actual
number
of
people
by
indulging
in
a...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
what
what
i
think
the
constitution
imports
with
reto-
respect
to
the
term
actual
enumeration,
is
an
effort
to
go
out
and
find
a
count.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
we're
not
remotely
close
to
that
here.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
from
from
the
standpoint
of
the
constitution,
i
think
a
reasonably
good
argument
could
be
made
and
the
government
has
in
the
past
made
it,
that
sampling
if
it's
if
it
if
it
is
consistent
with
the
process
of
an
attempt
to
find
an
actual
count
utilizing...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
accurate
r-
and
non-manipulatable
techniques...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
i
believe
it
does
and
and
i
think,
chief
justice,
the
district
court
in
this
case
distinguished
actual
actual
enumeration
from
the
conjectural
apportionment
that
a-
[no

house
of
representatives.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
we
we...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
if
this
court
is
to,
or-
s-
determines
that
the
process
by
which
the
two
thousand
census
was
conducted
was
inconsistent
with
the
statute
or
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
and
orders
the
secretary
to
take
out
the
imputed...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
numbers
and
deliver
a
different
piece
of
information
to
the
president...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
the
president
will
transmit
that
certificate
or
that
certified,
those
certified
results
to
congress
for
the
process.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
the
president
will
do
what
this
court
assumed
in
those
cases
that
the
president
would...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
the
president
will...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
accept
the
import,
not
only
of
the
franklin
and
the
other
decision
that
we
referred
to,
but
also
if
this
court
decides
that
the
process
was
unconstitutional
or
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
the
president
will
accept
that,
this
court's
judgment
in
that
respect...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
if,
if
f-
for
for
that
reason,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
decides
that
that
is
not
the
kind
of
result
that
this
court
can
issue,
because
of
that
possibility,
we'll
accept
that
result
as
well.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
if
that
should
occur.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
works
works...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
what
we're
sa-
what
we're...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
only
can
answer
it
this
way,
justice
scalia.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
if
it
is
based
upon
a
decision
by
this
court
that
that
the
court
has
the
power
to
issue...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that
that
that
would
only
occur
in
the
context
of
this
court's
decision.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
we're
i
don't
think
we
need
to
or
give
anything
away,
justice
scalia.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
let
me
just
summarize
because
my
time
is
about
up.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
