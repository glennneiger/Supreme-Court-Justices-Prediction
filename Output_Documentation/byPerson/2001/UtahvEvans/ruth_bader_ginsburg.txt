common
that
in

lee,
didn't
it
prove
out
that,
a-
after,
that
in
the
majority
of
these
cases,
something
like
seventy-five
percent,
that
th-
they
know
for
sure
that
these
were
houses
where
people
lived?

but
you
don't
have
a
n-
negative
showing,
either,
that
that
it
wasn't
accurate?
and
it
there
was
something
justice
o'connor
said,
and

bis-
mr.
dellinger,
you
have
recognized
that
your
argument
is,
a
state
in
the
position
of
utah
that
can't
project
what
the
returns
will
be,
does
not
have,
does
not
qualify
as
an
aggrieved
person
at
the
only
moment
in
time
when
it
can
say
that
it
it's
aggrieved.
