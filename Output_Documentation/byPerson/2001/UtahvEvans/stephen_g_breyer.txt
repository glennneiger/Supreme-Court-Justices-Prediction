they're

assumption
that
if
the

delivers
pizza
to
the
place
and
people
eat
the
pizza,
ie
at
least
it
disappears,
that
there
is

in

can
they
make
that

the

about

there's
a

once
you're
down
that
road,
then
you're
then
then
i
can
easily
construct
examples
where
the

is
absolutely
as
strong.

you

well,
it
that

my

was
directed
at
a
particular
problem
that,
if
i
take
your
approach
i
can't
get
myself
out
of.
justice
stephen

seems
unfair
to
utah,
though,
to
say
that
they
are
supposed
to
bring
a
suit
before
they
know
they
have
been
hurt
and
why.
justice
stephen

sometimes
you
could
guess
in

but
a
lot
of
times
you
couldn't,
and
it's
important
that
there
be
a
fair
method
that
treats
states
fairly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
it
be
fair,
any
way,
to
cut
off
those
states
that
don't
know
they've
been
treated
unfairly
and
hurt,
until
they
find
out
later?

wh-
why
why,
just
out
of
curious-
i

i'd
like
to
understand
this
better.
justice
stephen

why
is
it
called

why
isn't
that
just
ordinary
inference?

what's

about...
justice

when
the
census
bureau
counts
population,
it
first
sends
out
forms
by
mail
to
each
address
on
a
long
list
of
addresses
that
it
has.
it
then
contacts
people
who
do
not
respond
by
sending
employees
to
make
personal
visits,
and
they
may
make
up
to
six
such
visits,
but
if
they
all
fail
to
elicit
the
information,
then
the
bureau
uses
what
it
calls
imputation,
which
is
the
subject
matter
of
this
case.
the
imputation
takes
an
address
on
its
millions
of
addresses
list,
an
address
where
there
is
inadequate
information
or
maybe
conflicting
information,
and
it
imputes
the
status
say
whether
the
address
is
a
vacant
lot
or
a
house,
or
it
imputes
the
number
of
occupants,
how
many
people
live
there,
and
it
does
it
by
assuming
that
this
unknown
address
has
the
same
characteristics
as
the
closest
nearby
similar
unit.
in
the
year
2000
the
census
imputation
accounted
for
about
0.4%
--
it
is
four
tenths
of
one
percent
of
the
total
count
--
but
because
the
imputation
counts
were
spread
in
an
uneven
way
across
the
country,
that
tiny
difference
makes
a
difference.
it
gave
north
carolina
an
additional
seat
in
congress,
and
if
imputation
had
not
been
used,
the
seat
would
have
gone
to
utah.
well,
utah
found
this
out
and
it
brought
a
suit,
and
in
this
suit
it
asks
the
court
to
set
aside
imputation
as
violating
both
statute
and
the
constitution.
now,
the
lower
court
in
this
case,
which
is
a
three-judge
federal
court
in
utah,
held
that
the
bureau
could
use
imputation;
it
was
lawful,
and
that
the
seat
belongs
to
north
carolina.
we
now
review
that
decision
and
we
affirm.
we
first
have
to
decide,
as
north
carolina
argues,
whether
utah
maybe
could
not
even
bring
this
suit
because
it
would
lack
standing,
but
we
find
that
utah
does
have
standing
focusing
on
the
relevant
issue
because
in
all
likelihood,
if
utah
had
won
the
case,
which
it
does
not,
but
if
it
had
won,
the
census
bureau,
the
president,
and
relevant
congressional
officials
would
in
all
likelihood
of
taken
the
steps
that
would
have
been
necessary
to
provide
utah
with
that
extra
seat.
therefore,
this
is
a
real
case.
then
second,
we
turn
to
the
statutory
question.
the
statute
forbids
the
bureau
to
use
“the
statistical
method
known
as
sampling”.
is
imputation
that
kind
of
statistical
method?
is
it
sampling?
the
solicitor
general,
in
argument
here,
used
an
example
to
help
explain
why
he
thought
it
was
not.
he
said
imagine
a
librarian
who
wants
to
find
the
number
of
books
in
a
library,
suppose
the
librarian
uses
a
statistically
sound
way
to
take
a
sample,
say
count
the
books
on
every
10th
shelf,
then
suppose
the
librarian
uses
a
statistically
sound
method
to
extrapolate
from
the
sample
to
the
whole,
say
he
multiplies
by
10.
that
is
what
is
the
sg
said
was
the
statistical
method
called
sampling.
now
suppose
instead
that
the
librarian
tries
to
count
each
book
one
by
one,
that
is
not
sampling,
and
it
does
not
become
sampling
just
because
the
librarian
finding
a
few
empty
spaces
on
some
shelves,
say
the
readers
have
the
books
out,
imputes
to
those
empty
spaces
a
number
of
books,
not
even
if
he
does
this
imputation
in
a
rather
technical
way,
say
by
measuring
the
size
of
nearby
books
and
dividing
the
size
of
the
empty
space
by
the
average
size
of
a
book.
now,
we
think
that
example
patches
the
basic
intuitive
distinction
between
sampling
and
imputation.
now,
we
support
that
intuitive
conclusion
by
elaborating
the
nature
of
the
differences
by
referring
to
technical
literature,
by
looking
at
statutory
history
and
reduce
fill
a
certain
amount
of
ink
along
the
way,
but
we
end
up
where
we
started.
when
the
statute
says
statistical
sampling,
it
does
not
mean
to
include
imputation.
so,
the
statute
does
not
forbid
its
use.
third,
we
ask
whether
the
constitution
forbids
imputation.
the
relevant
part
of
the
constitution
says
“representatives
and
direct
taxes
shall
be
apportioned
among
the
several
states
according
to
their
respective
numbers
counting
the
whole
number
of
persons
in
each
state.
the
actual
enumeration
shall
be
made
within
three
years
after
the
first
meeting
of
the
congress
in
such
manner
as
they
shall
by
law
direct.
now,
you
may
have
noticed
there
were
two
words
in
there,
actual
enumeration.
but
we
think
those
two
words
being
there
do
not
require
say,
an
individual
contact
between
a
counter
and
each
and
every
person
counted.
nor
do
those
words
otherwise
restrict
census
taking
method
so
stringently
that
they
would
forbid
the
imputation
used
here.
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
we
explore
the
context,
the
deligation
of
authority
to
congress,
a
relevant
history,
contemporary
linguistic
usage,
and
census
practices
both
in
the
18th
century
and
more
recent
times.
we
do
not
decide
precisely
what
limitations
those
words,
actual
enumeration,
do
impose.
we
conclude
only
that
they
do
not
bar
the
census
bureau’s
use
of
imputation
here
where
the
bureau
has
made
an
effort
to
reach
every
household
where
it
involves
a
tiny
percentage
of
the
population
and
where
the
alternative
would
mean
a
less
accurate
count.
we
consequently
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part;
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
kennedy
has
joined;
and
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
