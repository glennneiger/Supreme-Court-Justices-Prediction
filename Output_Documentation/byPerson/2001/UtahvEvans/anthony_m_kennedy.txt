well,
was
there
a
window
of
time
between
completion
of
the
census
and
the
the
submission
of
the
numbers
to
the
president
where
you
could
have
sued?
how
long
was
that
period
of
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
well,
if
you
prevail,
what's
what's
supposed
to
happen?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
mean
that's,
that's
even
worse.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
a-
what
what's
what's
what's
your
closest
case
to
show
that
a
a
declaration
of
this
kind
satisfies
s-
the
requirement
of
redressability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
par-
excuse
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
fractured
opinion...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
i'm
i'm
curious
both
in
your
argument
here
this
morning
and
in
the
brief,
i
i
think
both
parties
seem
to
assume
that
the
key
question
is
whether
or
not
this
is
sampling.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
but
the
act
refers
both
to
sampling
and
to
other
methods
of
statistical
adjustment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
that's
a
statistical
methodology
or
is
it
just
a
method
of
making
deductions
from
circumstantial
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
also
said
that
statistical
adjustments
pose
a
risk.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
remotely
estimation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
why
i
asked
about
estimation
is
y-
you
say
there's
a
difference
in
an
estimation
and
a
deduction,
i
suppose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
happens
after
that?
he
transmits
to
the
c-
to
the
congress,
i
take
it
the
clerk
of
the
congress
says
not
certified,
or
the
of
the
house
has
not
certified
the
results
yet?
or...
