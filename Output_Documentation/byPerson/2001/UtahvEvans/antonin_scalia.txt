tho-
those
are
not
cases
where
after,
the
after
the
deadline
provisions,
you
have
a,
r-
m-
a
a
basic
change
in,
in
in
in
the
court's
role,
that
after
the
deadline
in
this
case,
you
are
going
to
have
to,
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
issue
an
opinion
that
purports
to
bind
the
president.
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
we've
never
held
that
a
declaratory
judgment
will
issue
where
the
court
has
no
power
to
to
compel
the
action
that
the
that
the
declaratory
judgment
describes.

justice
antonin
scalia
it's
it's
not
the
same
kind
of
inference
that
that
is
done
by
what
yo-
what
by
what
you
say
is
sampling
mainly,
im-
im-
imputing
information
that
belongs
to
a
part
to
the
whole.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
had
no
incentive
to
do
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
could
have
gotten
a
s-
a
stalking
horse
to,
some
suburbanite
to
bring
the
suit
but
he
had
no
no
notion
that
it
there
was
any
reason
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
are
you
sure
they
were
not
aggrieved
at
the
beginning?
i'm
i'm
surprised
that
you
i
mean,
i-
is
it
not
an
aggrievement
for
the
state
of
utah
or
for
any
state
that
its
districts
are
distorted?
even
if
it
doesn't
doesn't
lose,
you
know,
congressmen
for
to
another
state,
isn't
the
distortion
of
the
districts
within
that
state
b-
a
grievance
of
that
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
against
all
of
that,
and
i'm
i'm
not
sure
why
we
should
give
deference
to
the
agency
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
lot
of
water
over
the
dam
since
six
years
ago.
justice
antonin
scalia
refer
to
meade
in
particular.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
sampling,
presumably.
justice
antonin
scalia
pretty
accurate...
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
it
estimation?
you...
justice
antonin
scalia
estimate
that
there
are
so
many
people
in
this
house
because
the
house
next
door
to
it
has
that
many
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
think
sampling
sampling
would
have
been
okay
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned?
real,
real
sampling?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
and
just
guess
that
the
other
third
is
pretty
much
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
argument
is
that
since
enumeration
doesn't
mean
anything
except
census,
sampling
would
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
bad
that's
that's
that's
not
the
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
do,
do,
is
it
your
position
that
the
pre-
that
the
president
will
have
to
do
whatever,
whatever,
accept
whatever
revised
census
figures
are
submitted
to
him
by
,
by
the
secretary?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
he...
justice
antonin
scalia
he
he's
oh
you
he's
told
you
that
that
that's
what
he'll
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
see
s-
because
i
sort...
justice
antonin
scalia
sort
of
wouldn't
want
to
make
the
people
of
north
carolina
mad
by
taking
away
one
of
their
representatives.
justice
antonin
scalia
look
at
this
judgment
of
the
court,
doesn't
run
against
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
you
you
say
you
presume
the
president
will
obey
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
accepting
the
position
that
the
president
must,
even
if
he
didn't
want
to,
that
the
law
requires
him
to
transmit
what
whatever
the
secretary
gives
him,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
answer
that
question
yes
or
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no
objection?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
not
the
question
i
asked.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
asked
is
whether,
you
s-
you
say
the
president
will
obey
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
tell
the
secretary
that
le-
let's
assume
we
we
we
say
we
have
the
power
to
tell
the
secretary
does
does
the
president
acknowledge
that
he
is
bound
by
law
to
transmit
whatever
figures
the
secretary
gives
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
give
that
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
fine.
