mr.
lee,
i
i
would
like
to
ask
you
to
address
early
on
whether
this
injury
that
utah
alleges
to
have
suffered
is
redressable
in
any
fashion.
things
have
happened
since
the
census
was
taken.
north
carolina
presumably
has
drawn
districts
and
has
gone
quite
far
down
the
road
in
reliance
on
the
census.
the
president
has
turned
over
the
numbers
and
so
forth.
how
can
this
be
redressed,
do
you
think,
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
jurisdiction,
but
i
don't
know
that
we
have
really
addressed
the
redressability
issue
fully
in
prior
cases.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
is
that?
i
mean,
you
knew,
did
you,
that
the
census
bureau
planned
to
use
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
had
an
injury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
percentage
of
homes
in
the
united
states
when
they
take
the
census
turn
out
to
be
vacation
or
second
homes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
e-
techniques
apparently
treat
all
the
dwellings
that
are
identified
as
residences
to
be
counted?
they
don't
discount
for
a
percentage
that
are
vacation
homes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
the
imputation
method
as
i
understand
it,
the
assumption
is
made
that
if
a
house
is
there,
that
it
is
a
residence,
and
a
second
assumption
is
made
that
the
number
of
occupants
will
be
that
in
in
a
general
geographic
area
of
other
homes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
mr.
lee
as
i
understand
it,
the
imputation
method
that
was
actually
used
after
the
two
thousand
census
has
the
effect
of
counting
non-households
as
households
in
some
instances.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
counts
one
household
several
times
in
some
instances.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it's
and
the
imputation
is
not
based
on
the
nearest
neighbor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
not
my
understanding,
but
we
can
explore
that
with
the
other
side.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
didn't
think
the
imputation
involved
any
actual
things
like
looking
at,
when
pizza
was
delivered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
could
i-
the
challenge
have
been
brought
before
utah
knew
that
the
imputation
figures
caused
this
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
statutory
time
period
for
people
to
challenge
the
the
census
bureau
proposed
techniques
before
the
census
is
taken?
is
there
some
provision
whereby
that
challenge
can
be
made?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mhm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i-
is
it
a
fact
that
somebody
is
aggrieved
when
you
are
at
the
stage
of
the
census
bureau
just
saying
this
is
what
i
plan
to
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mhm...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
before
you
go
on
to
the
merits,
you
have
nothing
else
to
say
then
about
justiciability?
i
mean,
let's
suppose
they
can
file
a
suit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
going
to
be
at
the
end
of
the
day
at
this
stage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
dellinger,
this
isn't
really
a
use
of
proxy
information.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
to
be
realistic
about
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
on
the
merits,
i
think
i-
we
have
to
know
whether
this
so-called
hot-deck
imputation
is
a
form
of
sampling.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
appears
that
it
might
well
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
do
we
call
it
hot-deck?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
we
said
in
the
wisconsin
versus
new
york
case
referred
to
by
your
opponent,
mr.
dellinger.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
this
very
kind
of
action,
this
imputation,
and
indicated
that
that
was
vastly
different
from
the
broader
statistical?
