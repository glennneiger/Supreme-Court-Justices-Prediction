justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what's
su-
supposed
to
happen
under
the
act?
i
mean,
the
act,
i
went
back
and
read
the
act
last
night.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
i
will
presume
that,
too,
but
that
was
four
justices,
and
there
there
wasn't
a
specific
discussion
of
of
what
is
supposed
to
happen
under
the
statute,
even
assuming
the
president
sort
of
takes
counsel
from
our
opinion.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
said
and
as
you
know,
i
i
i
joined
his
opinion.
justice
david
h.
souter
will
they,
i
mean,
it
it's
it
seemed
so
to
me
at
the
time
but
it's
a
real
issue
in
this
case,
as
to
whether
the
the
statute
which
is
which
is
geared
to
delivery
of
information
at
certain
times
can
in
effect
reverse
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you,
on
that
theory,
would
you
agree
that
although
they
may
not
impute
a
number
beyond
one,
it
would
be
fair
for
them
at
leaf
at
least
to
count
it
as
one?
because
they
start
out
as
i
understand
it
with
a
in
affect
a
report
from
post
office
saying
you
know
this
is
a
house
at
which
somebody
lives.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
doesn't
an
an
address
usually
mean
somebody
lives
there,
at
least
if
we
can
establish
that
it's
a
residential
neighborhood?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
it
it
wouldn't
in
a
literal
sense
if
you
were
simply
making
one
imputation
at
a
time,
but
you
were
making
a
long
series
of
imputations
from
the
one
sample,
in
this
case,
the
one
house.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
six
hundred
and
twenty
to
tell
you
about
just
any
random
six
hundred
and
twenty.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
that,
i
mean
that
would
be
true
about
any
inferential
conclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
seem
to
be
accepting
marbury
and
madison.
