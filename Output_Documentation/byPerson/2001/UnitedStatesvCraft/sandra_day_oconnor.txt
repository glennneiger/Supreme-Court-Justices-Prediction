taxability
at

a

do
you
suppose?

federal
law,
and
as
a
policy
matter
we
generally
look
to
state
law?
but
isn't
that
itself
a
question
of
federal
law,
the
extent
to
which
we're
going
to
look
to
state
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
tax
purposes,
i'm
just
wondering
if
at
bottom
it
it
isn't,
in
fact,
a
question
of
federal
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
when
the
respondent’s
husband
failed
to
pay
his
federal
income
tax,
a
federal
tax
lien
attached
to
all
his
property
and
rights
to
property.
at
the
time
that
respondent
and
her
husband
owned
a
piece
of
property
classified
by
michigan
law
as
tenancy
by
the
entirety,
a
unique
form
of
co-ownership
reserved
for
married
people.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
her
husband
had
property
or
rights
to
property
in
the
tenancy
by
the
entirety
to
which
the
tax
lien
could
have
attached.
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
under
michigan
law,
respondent’s
husband
had
no
property
right
in
the
entirety’s
estate.
we
now
reverse.
because
the
federal
tax
lien
statute
itself
creates
no
property
rights,
this
court
looks
initially
to
state
law
to
determine
what
rights
the
taxpayer
has
in
the
relevant
property.
ultimately
however,
whether
these
rights
constitute
property
for
purposes
of
the
federal
tax
lien
as
a
question
of
federal
law.
if
property
is
as
they
say
a
bundle
of
sticks,
a
collection
of
individual
rights
which
in
certain
combination
may
constitute
property,
state
law
determines
which
sticks
are
in
the
taxpayers
bundle,
while
federal
law
determines
whether
the
label
property
may
attach
to
those
sticks.
whether
a
state
law
would
also
label
those
sticks
as
property
is
irrelevant.
michigan
law
gave
respondent’s
husband
rights
in
the
tenancy
by
the
entirety’s
property
consisting
of
the
right
to
use
the
property,
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
it,
the
right
to
receive
income
from
it,
and
the
right
to
alienate
(or
otherwise
encumber)
the
property
with
the
permission
of
his
spouse.
we
hold
that
these
rights
are
sufficient
to
constitute
property
for
the
purposes
of
the
federal
tax
lien
statute.
if
they
were
not
considered
properly,
the
entirety’s
estate
would
have
no
longer,
a
result
that
not
only
seems
strange
but
with
also
facilitate
tax
evasion.
it
is
true
that
michigan
law
exempts
entirety’s
property
from
the
reach
of
state
law
creditors
but
we
have
elsewhere
held
that
state
law
exemptions
do
not
bind
the
federal
government
and
they
should
not
do
so
here.
