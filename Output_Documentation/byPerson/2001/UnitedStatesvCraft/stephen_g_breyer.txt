a
sep-
justice
stephen

breyer
that
we
looked
up
just
says
that
community
property
can
be
severed
only
with
the
consent
of
both
spouses
in
the
event
of
divorce,
or
in
the
death
in
the
event
of
death
of
one
of
the
spouses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
that
that's
authoritative,
or
maybe
we
made
a
mistake,
but
it
certainly
was
my
impression
that
community
property
is
owned
by
a
community,
which
is
a
different
legal
entity,
and
i
also
thought
that
community
property
couldn't
be
separate
without
the
consent
of
the
spouse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're
right,
that
in
probably
a
third
or
more
of
the
country,
suddenly
the
irs
can't
assert
any
liens,
and
it's
a
little
tough
to
believe
that
congress
would
have
thought
that
that's
what
it
was
doing
with
this
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
be,
but
why
why
i
mean,
here,
a
lot
of
p-
a
lot
of
property
in
this
country
is
owned
by
communities,
ie,
the
husband
and
wife
together,
and
i
imagine
that
people
are
quite
free
to
take
their
real
property
in
the
form
of
tenancy
by
the
entirety.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
wh-
why
should
i
accept
an
interpretation
that's
going
to
exempt
about...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
amounts
of
property
from
this...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
know
what
the
implications
are...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
critical
factor
is
the
factor
that
creditors
under
state
law
can't
get
a
hold
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
it's
the
theory
of
the
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
the...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
theory
of
the
thing,
primarily,
plus
the
fact
all
right,
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
the
theory
of
it,
doesn't
the
same
theory
exist...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
with
community
property?
doesn't
the
same
theory
exist
with
joint
tenancies?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
all
i
know,
the
same
theory
exists
when
people
said,
you
don't
own
any
land,
you
just
hold
it
from
the
king,
and
you
have
feudal
obligations
unless
you
pass
along
the
season.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
point
there
is
right
is
right
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
interest.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
those
things
have
to
be
true,
the
theory
and
the...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
their
point
to
the
contrary
is
basically,
you're
right,
th-
s-
or
assuming
you're
right,
it's
still
definite
enough
to
get
at,
and
and
you
really
violate
state
law
policy
there
only
if
you
sell
the
property,
you
see,
but
as
long
as
and,
in-
indeed,
if
they
sell
it
on
their
own,
that's
their
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sell
it
on
their
own,
then
it
becomes
a
question
of
how
th-
the
judge
will
enforce
the
lien,
and
there
your
your
clients
or
the
equivalent
would
be
free
to
go
in
and
say,
don't
force
me
to
sell
the...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
they
do
they
in
a
d-
a
community
property
state,
can
one

force
division
over
the

an
