now,
th-

tell
us
about
the
fraudulent
conveyance
proceeding.
does
the
fraudulent
conveyance
holding,
or
finding,
make
no
difference
one
way
or
the
other?
if
it
was
a
fraudulent
conveyance
th-
the
husband
has
the
property
y-
you
you
can
well,
if
it
was
a
fraudulent
purveyance,
you
c-
you
c-
you
can
pursue
the
property,
and
if
it
wasn't,
the
lien
is
still
there
anyway
under
your
theory.
is
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
anthony
m.

right.
justice
anthony
m.

yes.

not
let

but
in
your
view,
you
always
value
the
taxpayer's
interest
at
at
fifty
percent?

be
a

to

could
the
congress
with
ease
en-
enact
s-
a
statutory
amendment
to
make
tenancy
by
the

subject
to

justice
anthony

well,
i
mean,
if
if
you
were
a
senator
from
michigan
wouldn't
you
say,
well,
you're
taxings
property
that
doesn't
belong
to
the
taxpayer,
this
is
improper
as
a
matter
of...

universe
here
if
is
that
the
state
defines
what's
property
and
the
federal
government
defines
what
property
can
be
liened.
justice
anthony
m.

quite
work,
because
one
of
the
sticks
in
the
property
definition
is
the
right
to
be
liening,
and
so
we're
we're
we're
compromising
that
dichotomy
even
by
stating
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
all
the
government
is
doing
here
is
saying,
we
are
saying
what
property
can
be
liened,
we're
entitled
to
define
that
one
stick
in
the
bundle.

the

to
determine
to
what

the

extends.

to
