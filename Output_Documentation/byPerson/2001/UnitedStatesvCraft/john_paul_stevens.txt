whether
the
taxpayer
has
a
legal
interest
in
the
property?
isn't
that
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
says
no,
there's
this
mythical
entity
called
the
marriage,
or
something
like
that
is
the
that's
the
owner.
justice

but
are
any
of
those
rights
legal
rights
owned
by
the
taxpayer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
get
a
lien
on
any
of
those
things
if
they
ever
came
into
being.
justice
john
paul
stevens
interrupt
you
once
more?
you,
in
dis-
in
describing
the
case,
said
that
each
of
them
was
entitled
to
notice
because
each
of
them
had
a
separate
right
in
the
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sort
of
inter-
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
comment
on
one
aspect
of
the
case
that
that
troubles
me?
let's
assume
i
think
there
are
two
court
of
appeals
decisions
out
there
that
are
squarely
on
point
and
against
you,
and
you
say
are
c-
incorrectly
decided.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
assume
they
are
incorrectly
decided,
but
they've
been
the
only
guidance
for
the
tax
bar
for
forty
or
fifty
years,
and
is
there
other
reliance
interests
that
the
tax
bar
can
say,
well,
we
always
thought
that,
given
those
cases
that
congress
had
not
sought
to
overrule,
we
have
a
right
to
follow
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but...
justice
john
paul
stevens
reliance
on
on
on
decisions
that
have
been
given
by...
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
one
question?
i
i
hate
to
take
up
your
reply
time
bu-
in
your
view,
will
the
decision
in
this
case
control
in
community
property
states,
er
rai-
raising
the
same
question?
