mr.
jones,
during
the
continuance
of
the
marriage
can
either
spouse
force
a
sale?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
joint
m-
i
may
be
wrong
in
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
during
the
continuance
of
the
joint
tenancy.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
i
take
it
from
your
earlier
answer
that
there
is,
in
in
in
tenancies
by
the
entirety
there
is
no
such
legal
means
of
converting
that
tenancy
into
a
tenancy
in
common
which
then
can
either
be
the
subject
of
a
forced
sale
or
petition,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
sutton,
is
is
it
true
that
any
any
conventional
property
interest
in
michigan
can
be
held
in
the
en-
m-
in
the
entirety
form.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
suppose,
if
you
follow
the
tha-
your
rationale
to
its
furthest
extent
in
a
state
such
as
one
justice
ginsburg
referred
to
in
which
business
assets
can
be
held
in
tenancy
by
the
entirety,
a
a
husband
and
wife
could
hold
a
a
have
a
closely
held
corporation
by
the
entirety
and
and
on
your
theory,
they
wouldn't
even
be
liable
for
income
tax
because
it
would
be
it
would
be
the
entirety
alone
that
would
be
liable.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
they
the
income
goes
into
a
bank
account
held
by
the
in
in
in
in
held
in
entirety
form.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
any
doubt,
either,
but
i
i
i
think
the
fact
that
there
isn't
any
serious
doubt
about
it
is,
at
least
so
far
as
the
states
that
justice
ginsburg's
example
referred
to,
there
there
there
also
is
an
inconsistency
between
the
fact
that
we
have
no
doubt,
as
you
say,
about
taxability
and
the
consequences
of
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
concern
that
the
tenancy
not
be
destroyed,
in
effect
as
a
result
of
a
consensual
act
by
one
of
the
spouses,
an
alienation
by
a
spouse
alone...
justice
david
h.
souter
incurring
of
debt
by
one
spouse
alone
as
a
consensual
act,
ie,
going
on
a
spending
spree?
but
here,
the
consensual
act
of
the
spouse
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
seems
to
me
outside
the
rationale
that
you're
proposing
for
the...
justice
david
h.
souter
sure
it
is.
