hear
argument

oh
oh
eighteen
thirty-one,
united
states
versus
sandra
craft.
mr.
jones.
[inaudible]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
be
given
notice
by
whom?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
how
did
that
case
come
up?
i
mean,
who
wh-
was
somebody
suing
the
joi-
the
tenants
by
the
entirety,
or...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
different
if
the
if
that
transaction
you
just
referred
to
hadn't
taken
place?
would
the
government's
case
be
weaker?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
taxpayer
rights
depend
on
state
law,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
what's
the
difference,
do
you
think
between
the
artificial
rules
and
the
realities?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
say
it's
a
fiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
community
property
states,
the
concept
of
a
marital
community
ha-
has
some
significance,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
d-
d-
d-
do
you
then
value
the
contingent
remainder?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're
we're
not
used
to
resolving
questions
of
state
law
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
the
nineteen
seventy-five
statute
does
not
affect
this
case
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
about
that,
mr.
sutton,
then
your
statement
that
congress
could
easily
amend
the
statute
to
collect
in
this
situation
probably
isn't
correct.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sure
you
can
generalize
as
to
community
property.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
sandy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
00-1831,
united
states
against
craft
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
