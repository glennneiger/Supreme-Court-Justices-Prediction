mr.
jones,
as
part
of
the
background,
how
did
it
come
about
that
it's
only
the
taxpayer
who
ha-
has
the
liability?
did
she
file
separate
returns,
or
was
she
an
innocent
spouse?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
her
situation
was?
did
she
not
file
also?
did
she
file
a
separate
return?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
how
that...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
jones,
y-
you're
not
asserting
that
the
government's
lien
gives
it
any
greater
right
than
he
has,
so
the
reci-
recitation
that
you
had,
you're
not
saying
that
the
government
lien
means
that
they
could
preempt
her
right,
are
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
differ
from
other
cases
where
under
state
law
a
predator
can't
touch
the
thing,
like
a
spendthrift
tru-
trust,
or
like
what
was
involved
in
drye?
even
though
not
a
single
predator
in
that
state
could
touch
that
inheritance,
the
federal
taxing
authorities
could,
so
there
are
many
situations
where
the
property
is
exempt
from
reach,
an-
even
where
the
state
doesn't
call
it
property,
calls
it
something
else,
but
the
elements
of
what
th-
the
person
had
lead
the
federal
authorities
to
say
this
is
the
property
of
so-and-so,
as
in
the
spendthrift
trust,
as
in
the
case
of
the
disclaiming
heir
in
drye,
so
why
is
this
any
different?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
different
from
a
state
law
that
said
mr.
drye
never
had
anything,
we
assume
under
our
state's
law
that
he
predeceased
his
mother?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
bank
accounts
can't
be...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
shares...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
states
are
there
that
have
tenancies
by
the
entireties?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
according
to
a
case
that
both
of
you
cited,
do
provide
tenancy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
court
comment
on
that
in
the
rodgers
decision
by
saying
that
the
f-
the
fact
that
congress
didn't
do
something
you
can't
infer
much
from
not
doing,
according
to
this
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
commented
on
it,
that
maybe
congress
didn't
do
anything
because
it
thought
that
the
this...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
case,
wasn't
the
sixth
circuit
saying,
well,
maybe
there
are
good
arguments
on
both
sides,
but
we've
got
that
old
precedent
that
we
have
to
follow.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
couldn't
thought
about
drye
the
first
time
around,
because
drye
wasn't...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
had
already
made
the
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
talking
about
now?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
that
there
was
considerable
attention
in
the
drye
case
to
exactly
what
it
was
you
look
to
state
law
for.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thought
you
said
that
whether
it's
property
is
determined
by
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
the
taxpayer
has
is
determined
by
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
the
label
that
we
put...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
ask
you
one
question
about
michigan
law
in
origin,
because
you
said
this
goes
back
to
eighteen
sixty-six,
so
it
was
probably
before
the
married
women's
property
act,
so,
at
least
in
some
states
it
was,
so
whatever
rights
there
were
to
control
and
make
decisions,
they
were
all
in
the
husband
at
that
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
sutton,
this
is
a
question
of
what
the
federal
taxing
authority
can
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
michigan
law,
just
as
arkansas
law,
continues
to
say,
creditors,
you
can't
get
at
this
disclaimed
property,
same
thing
michigan
can
say.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then,
if
congress
said
this
explicitly,
the
same
thing
would
follow,
everything
that
you
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
as
mr.
drye
didn't
when
his
state
law
said...
