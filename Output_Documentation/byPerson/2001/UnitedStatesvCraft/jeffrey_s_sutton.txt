mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
some
serious
misunderstandings
about
the
meaning
of
michigan
law
which
go
to
the
heart
of
the
proper
resolution
of
this
case
under
federal
law.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
it.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
f-
ninet-
eighteen
eighty-five,
vinton
versus
beamer,
going
forward
to
sanford,
going
to
budwit
versus
herr
those
are,
you
know,
separated
by
twenty
thirty
years
each.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
it's
irrelevant,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
this
is
not
a
disclaimer
or
exemption
case
for
this
basic
reason.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
d-
your
honor,
under
arkansas
law
in
drye,
the
opinion
notes
that
he
did
have
a
right
to
alienate
that
interest
once
his
wife
died.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
ab-
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
exactly
what
tyler
recognized,
the
nineteen
thirty-six
or
so
u.s.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes,
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i'm
not
relying,
your
honor,
on
what's
lienable
and
what's
not.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well
i,
your
honor,
i
did
not
mean
to
say
i
wou-
i
did
say
easily,
and
i
misspoke,
and
i'm
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
to
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
let
me
give
you
a
c-
s
and
b
trust,
it's
one
of
the
cases
we've
cited,
says
that
very
point,
and
that
makes
that
makes
sense.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
community
property
has
several
differences.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
n-
no.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
bu-
w-
y-
your
your
honor,
you're
right,
and
and
if
i'm...
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
that
th-
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
if
if
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument,
and
i'm
not
i-
i-
let's
assume
it's
true,
you
said
it's
true,
that
community
property
states
are
just
like
tenancy-in-the-entirety
states.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
oh,
y-
your
honor,
i
i
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
this
is
not
a
community
property
case,
and
i
think
it
would
be...
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
find,
in
each
of
the
states
that
you
you're
concerned
about,
the
interests
are
defined
just
as
they
are
in
michigan,
which
is
to
say,
it's
an
indivisible
interest,
no
shares,
it
follows
just
from
what
you've
said
in
rodgers
and
national
bank
of
commerce
that
you
can't
lien
the
property,
and
what
you've
got
to
do
is
wait
for
a
survivorship
interest,
wait
for
a
sale,
destruction
of
the
tenancy.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
years.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
fourteen
that
have
them
in
the
traditional
way
we're
talking
about,
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
indivisibility
of
title,
plus...
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
to
the
the
extent
congress
is
worried
about
that,
it's
surprising
in
nineteen
fifty-four
that
they
didn't
amend
the
statutes,
even
more...
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
the
nineteen
fifty-four
history
is
relevant,
i
would
think
all
would
agree,
when
it
comes
to
the
notion
that
somehow
this
is
a
great
tax-avoidance
problem.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
bu-
well
your
honor,
by
nineteen
sixty-six
i
mean
well,
by
the
present,
we've
got
seven
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
i
i
i'm
not
sure
what
the
sixth
circuit
had
in
mind,
but
certainly
followed
its
precedent,
didn't
think
drye,
irvine
had
changed
the
law...
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
certainly
don't
know
why
each
court
of
appeals
has
done
what
it
did,
including
the
sixth
circuit,
but
the
fact
is,
they've
all
done
the
same
thing.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
sixty-one,
which
is
the
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code
that
taxes
property,
income
from
tenancy
by
the
entirety
property
is
still
taxed.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
i
i'm
i'm
not
going
to
be
in
a
position
to
cite
any
cases
for
this
poi-
the
point
i'm
about
to
make,
so
you're
going
to
want
to
check
me
on
it,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
when
it
comes
to
income
from
tenancies-by-the-entirety
property,
the
case
law,
the
code,
the
regulations
make
it
clear
that
they're
still
there
still
taxable.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
it's
a
v-
they're
very
different
concepts
and
maybe
it's
important,
particularly
in
light
of
justice
breyer's
comment
about
this
just
seeming
to
be
a
fiction,
there's
a
real
function
behind
this
concept,
and
the
function
is
that,
while
the
tenancy
is
premised
on
this
nice
notion
of
two
hearts
beating
as
one,
the
fact
is
that
doesn't
always
happen,
and
the
whole
point
of
the
tenancy
and
the
indivisibility
of
title
is
that
it
precludes
one
spouse
unilaterally
from
destroying
or
otherwise
incumbering
the
tenancy.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
it's...
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
[inaudible]
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
u-
u-
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
r-
i
really
hope
i
can
clarify
this
because
i
do
think
it
cuts
the
heart
of
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
would
s-
submit,
your
honor,
that
when
it
comes
to
the
tax
lien
statute
the
court
is
has
said
several
times
that
congress
did
not
dis-
define
the
words,
property,
rights
to
property
belonging
to.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
your
honor,
i
had
thought
that
y-
you
take
the
state
law's
property
interests
as
you
find
them
in
the
fifty
or
fifty-one
jurisdictions,
h-
depending
on
how
you
want
to
look
at
it,
and
then,
depending
how
the...
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
it
is
a
question
of
federal
law
what
the,
quote,
consequences
of
those
state
law
definitions
are,
but
let
me
give
you,
i
think,
a
good
indication
of
this,
and
it
relates
to
a
hard
issue
raised
by
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
national
bank
of
commerce,
nineteen
eighty-five,
joint
bank
account.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
what've
i
said
that
makes
you
think
i'm
disagreeing
with...
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i'm
i'm
simply
saying
the
interests
in
the
property
are
determined
by...
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
exactly.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
i'm
sorry
if
i
left
that
ambiguous.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
t-
to
use
the
sticks
in
the
bundle
analogy,
every
interest
under
state
law
in
michigan
regarding
this
tenancy,
each
stick
has
to
be
exercised
two
by
two,
not
one
by
one,
but
every
one
of
them
is
two
by
two,
husband
and
wife,
and
certainly
not
three
by
three,
which
is
what
the
federal
government
is
saying
here.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
i
i
couldn't
a-
agree
more,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
hope
i'm
responding
to
your
question.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
most
of
the
married
women's
property
acts
were,
almost
all
of
them
were
passed
before
eighteen
sixty-six,
so
first
of
all
that
defect,
i
would
call
it,
in
the
old
tenancy
simply
was
no
longer
true,
and
even
in
the
st-
even
in
some
states
where
that
continued,
it
was
still
this,
i
guess
it's
jure
uxoris
concept,
that
it
it
wasn't
the
husband
as
an
individual
having
an
opportunity
to
do
this,
it
was
the
husband
acting
on
behalf
of
the
wife,
but
that
just
isn't
true
under
michigan
law.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
the
only
i
agree
with
you,
michigan
could
change
the
law,
though
i
think
at
that
point
the
rationale...
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
the
the
problem
for
people
like
the
crafts
is
that
they've
already
said
it.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
but
your
your
honor,
it's
a
unilateral
act,
number
one,
by
the
spouse,
and
number
two,
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
it
is
a
lot
like
the
loan,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
they
could
do
what
they
did
in
the
estate
tax,
which
is
regulate
it
specifically.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
why
why
doesn't
mrs.
craft
have
a
takings
argument
the
minute
this
lien
attaches
for
the
entire
value
of
her
property?
why
is
that
not
the
case?
it's
not
obvious
to
me.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
but
there
was
only
one
taxpayer
in
drye.
