mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
tax
lien
that
applies
by
operation
of
law
to
all
property
and
rights
to
property
of
a
delinquent
taxpayer
attaches
to
the
interest
of
that
taxpayer
in
a
tenancy
by
the
entirety.
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
was
an
attorney
who,
for
ten
years,
failed
to
file
a
federal
income
tax
return
and
accumulated
a
federal
tax
obligation
of
approximately
half
a
million
dollars.
excuse
me.
at
the
time
the
taxes
were
assessed
and
the
notice
of
tax
lien
was
filed,
the
taxpayer
owned
a
real
property
in
a
joint
tenancy
by
the
entirety
with
his
wife.
he
then
conveyed
his
interest
in
that
property
to
his
wife
for
one
dollar
and
when
his
wife
then
sought
to
sell
the
property
the
tax
lien
appeared
in
the
title
record.
[inaudible]
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
we
would
say
that
the
lien,
th-
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
lien
is
the
first
question.
if
the
lien
is
valid
you
don't
need
to
address
the
fraudulent
conveyance
question.
indeed,
we
haven't
presented
the
fraudulent...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
conveyance
question
in
this
case.
if
the
lien
were
not
valid,
it
would
still
be
possible
to
go
after
property
in
certain
circumstances
if
there
had
been
a
fraudulent
conveyance,
but
on
this
record
we're
not
challenging
the
determination
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
was
not
a
fraudulent
conveyance,
except
for
this
fraudulent
enhancement
portion
that
the
court
awarded.
[inaudible]
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
this
case,
the
taxpayer
is
the
husband.
the
husband
was
an
attorney,
and
he
filed
no
return,
and
when
th-
there's
two
ways
for
this
issue
to
come
up.
eithe-
either
spouse
may
file
either
no
return,
or
file
only
a
separate
return.
it's
only
when
they
file
a
joint
return
that
they
are
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
the
tax
obligation,
so
if,
as
in
this
case,
the
taxpayer
simply
files
no
return
at
all,
then
the
obligation
is
exclusively
that
the
tax
obligation
is
that
of
the
nonfiler,
in
this
case
the
husband.
indeed,
judge
ryan
pointed
out
in
his
separate
opinion
that
the
decision
of
this
court,
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
very
amenable
to
abuse,
because
on
this
theory
both
spouses
can
earn
income,
neither
of
them
can
file
a
return,
or
they
can
both
file
a
separate
return,
and
then
they
can
put
all
of
their
real
and
personal
property
in
a
tenancy
by
the
entirety,
i-
i-
including
stocks
and
bonds
in
states
like
michigan
and
maryland,
and
claim
a
complete
exemption
of
all
of
their
property
from
federal
tax
obligations.
now,
i-
in...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
are
some
penalties,
but
the
penalties,
like
taxes,
have
to
be
enforced
against
the
property
of
the
taxpayer,
and
if
the
taxpayer
is
allowed
to
exempt
all
of
its
property
in
this
fashion,
then
there's
literally
no
way
that
that
the
taxes
can
be
enforced
at
least
through
civil
procedures.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
[inaudible]
what
about
criminal
procedures?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
of
course,
if
you
file
a
return,
then
you're
not
exposing
yourself
to
any
criminal
obligations,
and
if
you
don't
file
a
return,
it
would
be
i'm
not
familiar
with
a
statute
that
makes
that
a
crime
by
itself.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
all
right,
well,
i
stand...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
all
questions
on
title
eighteen
to
justice
kennedy.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
know
whether
she
had
any
income
of
her
own.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
believe
the
record
reflects.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
the
underlying
issue...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it's
a
real
entity.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
indeed
the
s-
s-
su-,
in
fact,
the
supreme
court
in
michigan
has
so
held.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
exactly
the
interest
that
the
taxpayer
had
in
the
rodgers
case
in
a
homestead
state.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
and
i-
if
i
might
go
on,
there
are
more
interests
involved.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
they
are
in
being,
and
that's
what
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
pointed
out
in
dow
versus
state.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
of
an-
of
any
action
that
might
be
brought
with
respect
to
the
property.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i-
in
my
recollection
is
that
it
was
a
a
foreclosure-type
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
said
that
i
the
words
well,
i
don't
have
the
text...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
is
entitled
to
separate
notice...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
because
they
have
a
significant
interest
in
the
property,
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
government's
case
would
be
significantly
different
if
the
sale
had
not
occurred.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
what
the
court
explained
was
that
s-
congress
specifically
provided
in
seventy-four
oh
three
of
the
code
that
the
foreclosure
applies
to
the
entire
property,
and
that
in
that
sale
the
rights
of
the
innocent
spouse
are
protected
and,
indeed,
the
the
court
district
court
has
discretion
not
even
to
order
a
foreclosure
if
it
so
chooses.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
or
if
or
if
it's
sold,
mr.
kent
l.
jones
entitled
all
of
it
if
he's
the
survivor.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
this
court
discussed
that
exact,
pri-
what
the
court-
court
called
the
practical
reality
in
in
the
rodgers
case,
and
gave
a
detailed
example
that
i
think
took
three
or
four
pages
of
the
court's
opinion
in
rodgers,
explaining
how
you
would
value
the
respective
interests
of
the
parties.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
there
that
was
a
h-
i
believe
those
were
hypothetical
facts
that
the
court
discussed
in
rodgers.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
and
and
nei-
and
then
and
that
was
the
point
made
in
rodgers
also,
that
in
any
kind
of
joint
tenancy
by
the
way,
i
should
emphasize...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
o-
i
misspoke.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
every
joint...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
a
common
feature
of
joint
tenancies
that
they
can't
be
forcibly
sold
by
one
and,
indeed...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
correct,
and
and
that
that
was
the
case
in...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right
could
not
be...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
believe
that's
correct,
and
i
believe
it
was
also
true
in
rodgers
of
the
homestead
estate,
which
is
a
common
sim-
other
s-
which
is
also
a
common
estate.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
realities
of
the
traxpayer's
[:
taxpayer's]
right
are
drawn
from
state
law,
but
we're
not
supposed
to
i
mean,
in
the
cou-
words
of
the
court,
let
the
artificial
rules
of
state
law
blind
us
to
the
realities
of
those
rights,
and
let
me
give
you...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
this
this
court
has
said
that
difference
can
be
seen
in
tenancies
by
the
entirety,
that
the
the
realities
are
that
the
tenants
i
mean,
it
is
a
fiction
there.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
fiction
is
what...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
what
is
a
fiction
is
the
idea
that
neither
spouse
actually
owns
an
interest
in
this
property.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
marriage...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
marriage
is
the
fact.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
and
the
court
made
that
point
in
drye.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
not
a...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
was...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
an
expectancy,
thank
you.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
if
i
might,
in
in
in
a
case
called
united
states
versus
mitchell,
involving
the
community
property
right
of
a
spouse
to
disclaim
her
interest
in
the
in
the
income
o-
o-
o-
of
of
her
spouse,
this
court
said
that
the
disclaimer,
this
retroactive
disclaimer,
this
fiction
of
state
law
would
not
be
recognized
and
would
not
upset
the
application
of
federal
tax...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we-
mr.
kent
l.
jones
recognizes
these
property
rights.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
tax
bar
is
not
th-
a
party
to
this
case,
and
and...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
question
is
that
no,
that
that
there
is
no
embedded
reliance
in
this
principle
because,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
even
in
michigan
there
is
an
express
caution
given
by
the
state
bar
to
title
examiners
saying
that,
in
light
of
the
nineteen
seventy-five
enactment
of
this
statute
that
gives
each
spouse
an
equal
right
to
all
of
the
income
and
and
and
and
and
profits
from
the
property,
that
the
state
bar
advised
title
examiners
that
they
could
not
give
an
opinion
that
the
interest
of
an
in-
an
individual
spouse
was
not
subject
to
the
lien.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
indeed,
a
narrow
basis
that
you
just
described
for
resolving
this
case,
and
and
and
it
would
be
an
appropriate
w-
way
to
resolve
the
case
because
we
have
the
fund
pres-
we
have
here
th-
the
voluntary
the
sale,
with
the
proceeds
available
for
distribution,
so
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
broader
question
of
whether
the
existence
of
the
right
of
survivorship,
which
is
an
undisputed
personal
interest.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
government's
lien
attaches
to
the
interests
of
the
contingent
remaindermen,
and
there
are
cases
on
that
very
point.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct,
but
also
that
section
seventy-four
oh
three
reserves
the
right
of
a
district
court
not
to
award
foreclosure
and,
of
course,
foreclosure
requires
the
government
to
do...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
to
so
far
as
i
know
this
co-
this
controversy
that
you're
concerned
about
has
not
been
presented
in
an
actual
case,
so
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
a
i
mean,
it's
a
theoretical
issue
that
i
don't
believe
has
been
confronted,
but
what
has
been
confronted
is
is,
does
the
lien
attach
to
contingent
remainders,
and
that's
in
re
well,
there's
a
lot
of
in
re's.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
as
i
was
saying,
i
don't
know
of
a
case
where
a
fli-
foreclosure
has
been
sought
on
a
contingent
remainder.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
would
i'm
i'm
to
be
honest,
i
would
be
guessing,
but
my
guess...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you
use
the
word
contingency,
that
would
include
rodgers,
because
that
was
a
case
where
there
was
a
right
of
survivorship
was
was
the
valued
interest,
but
there's
also
the
bank
one
case,
spendthrift
trust,
the
right
of
a
person
to
obtain
income
from
a
spendthrift
trust
is
subject
to
the
federal
lien.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we-
i
what
i
will
what
is
in
the
statute
that
that
i
h-
mr.
kent
l.
jones
what
i
have
i-
in
in
my
possession
is
a
copy
that
says
that
the
effective
date
is
nineteen
seventy-five,
and
i
do
know
that
in
dow
versus
state,
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
in
nineteen
seventy-six,
they
applied
that
statute
to
a
tenancy
that
had
been
created
prior
to
nineteen
sixty-five.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
have
such
a
lien
in
this
case,
both
from
the
right
of
survivorship,
if
we
ever
had
to
get
there,
but
more
importantly
because
the
we
have
a
lien
in
the
right
to
receive
proceeds.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
the
principles
that
you
apply
will,
of
course,
control,
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
and
and
whether
yo-
whether
a
decision
in
this
case
addressed
principles
that
would
extend
or
apply
in
that
situation
as
well
as
this,
i
can't
say.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
state
law
there
are
there
are
limitations,
but
those
state
law
limitations
have
already
been
held
to
be
ineffective
against
federal
tax...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct
and
and
and
in
and
again
in
the
mitchell
case
the
court
held
that
that
that
state
law
fictions
about
the
r-
relative
rights
in
in
community
proper
[:
property]
states
are
no
more
binding
on
the
federal
tax
collector
than
in
other
contexts.
