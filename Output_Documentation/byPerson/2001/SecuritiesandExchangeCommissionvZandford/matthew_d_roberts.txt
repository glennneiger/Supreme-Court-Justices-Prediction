mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
stockbrokers
like
the
respondent
are
the
critical
link
between
the
national
securities
markets
and
individual
investors
who
trust
brokers
to
buy
and
sell
securities
for
their
benefit.
respondent
betrayed
that
trust
by
selling
his
customers'
securities
not
for
their
benefit,
but
for
a
secret
purpose
of
misappropriating
the
proceeds
and
by
embezzling
the
proceeds
as
he
had
planned.
in
so
doing,
respondent
violated
section
10(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
and
rule
10b-5.
those
provisions
prohibit
the
use
of
fraud
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security.
respondent--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that
embezzlement
would
not
be
in
connection
with
the
prior
sale
under
the
theory
that
we
are
asking
the
court
to
adopt
here.
but
the
sec
believes
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
10(b)
under
a
different
theory
which
isn't
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
one--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--you
don't
have
to
agree
with
that
to
find
a
violation
here.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
they
involve
both
situations,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
both
situations.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
am
not
aware
that
they
routinely
audit
the
brokers.
the
nasd
does
do
that
and
then
refers
matters
to
the
sec
and
consults
with
the
sec.
the
sec
also
would
respond
to
complaints
that
they
got
or
take
investigations
if
they
had
reason
to
believe
it
was
called
to
their
attention.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
they
could
request
a
prosecution,
your
honor,
but
it's
important
that
the
sec
is
the
federal
agency
that's
charged
with
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
markets
and
investor
confidence
in
the
markets,
have
direct
authority
to
prevent
and
to
pursue
the
kind
of
fraud
that's
involved
here
which
is
very...
potentially
very
unsettling
to
the
markets.
because
since
most
transactions
are
made
through
brokers,
if
customers
and
investors
can't
trust
their
brokers
to
be
executing
their
transactions
for
the
customer's
benefit
rather
than
for
the
broker's
benefits,
the
markets
can't
function
effectively.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
goes
back
to
the
question
that
justice
scalia
asked
me,
your
honor.
and
under
the
theory
that
we
are
advocating
here,
and
for
the
court
to
rule
for
us
here,
you
don't
need
to
conclude
that.
the
sec
does
take
that
position.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
any
fraudulent
conversion
by
a
broker
from
a
brokerage
account
is
a
violation
of
10(b)
because
it's
fraud
and
it's
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities;
because
the
very
purpose
of
the
brokerage
account
is
to
buy
and
sell
securities.
and
the
broker
has
access
to
the
customer's
assets--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--for
the
purpose
of--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that
is
beyond
any
case
that
i'm
aware
that
you
have
decided.
but
here
the
broker
actually
converted
the
securities
by
means
of
fraudulent
sales.
and
his
deception
not
only
caused
the
sales,
it
was
material
to
the
sales.
and
the
sales
themselves,
because
they
were
fraudulent,
coincided
with
and
completed
the
fraud.
and
that's
very
much
in
tune...
that's
really
controlled
by
past
cases
of
the
court.
for
instance
in
the
bankers
life
case,
the
court
held
that
corporate
fiduciaries
violated
section
10(b)
when
they
deceived
the
corporation
into
believing
that
it
would
receive
the
proceeds
of
the
securities
that
the
corporation
sold.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
there
wasn't
a
misrepresentation
in
bankers
life
about
a
particular
security,
there
was
a
misrepresentation
that
the
corporation
would
receive
the
proceeds.
and
there
was
that
same
misrepresentation
here,
your
honor,
only
it
was
by
way
of
an
omission
or
a
course
of
conduct
rather
than
an
affirmative
statement.
because
the
customers
had
entrusted
respondent
with
the
authority
to
trade
on
their
behalf,
with
the
understanding
and
the
implicit
representation
that
he
would
trade
on
their
behalf
and
that
they
would
receive
the
proceeds
of
the
sales,
that
they
would
be
used
for
their
benefit
in
other
trades
when--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that
would
have
turned
it
from
fraud
into
theft.
it
would
have
also
been
a
breach
of
his
fiduciary
duty
if
he
went
ahead
and
they
didn't
authorize
him.
but
just
like
in
o'hagan--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it
wouldn't
have
been
fraud
if
there
was
no
deception.
it's
critical
to
a
10(b)e
violation
that
there
be
deception
of
some
kind.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
in
this
circumstance,
yes,
the
customer
could
have
brought
a
private
action
against
the
broker,
your
honor.
that
wouldn't
be
true
in
every
circumstance
because
the
customer,
a
private
plaintiff
seeking
damages
has
to
prove
elements
of
a
violation
in
addition
to
what
the
sec
must
prove.
a
customer
has
to
show
causation
of
the
transaction
and
loss
or
damages
to
the
customer.
the
customer
also
has
to
be
an
actual
purchaser
seller.
in
the
situation
where
there's
a
sale
by
the
broker
of
the
customer's
securities,
the
purchaser-seller
requirement
will
be
met.
but
there
might
not
be
the
damages
that
are
necessary
unless
the
broker
follows
through
with
his
scheme
to
misappropriate
the
proceeds
of
the
sale.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
but
he
did.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
why
the
restitution
award
in
the
criminal
action
was
limited
to
$10,000.
but
it's
clear
that
respondent,
it's
clear
from
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
and
also
from
the
criminal
trial
that
respondent
did
embezzle
far
more
than
that
amount
of
the
woods'
assets.
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
it's
important
for
the
sec
to
be
able
to
pursue
this
action.
because
if
it
had
to
rely
on
the
criminal
action,
then
there
wouldn't
be
a
full
disgorgement
of
the
improper
gains
by
the
broker.
and
there
would
be
far
less
deterrent
to
this
kind
of
activity.
of
course
a
criminal
prosecution
is
significant
deterrent,
but--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it
does...
it
does
comport
with
our
theory,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
in
so
many
words
allege
the
intent
at
the
time.
but
the
factual
allegations
in
the
complaint
necessarily
give
rise
to
that
inference.
because,
first,
one
of
the
allegations
is
that
respondent
issued
checks
to
himself
on
the
mutual
fund
account
and
that
the
cashing
of
those
checks
caused
the
sales.
and
so
when
he
took
the
money,
he
necessarily
by
writing
the
checks
to
himself,
he
necessarily
had
the
intent
at
the
time.
and
then
there
are
additional
allegations--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--in
the...
in
the
mutual
fund
checks,
if
you
look
at
page
28a,
of
the
petition,
in
paragraph
16
of
the
complaint,
it
describes
the
beginning
of
the
fraudulent
scheme
in
may
of
1988,
shortly
after
mr.
wood
was
hospitalized
as
a
result
of
his
stroke,
and
notes
that
between
may
and
june
1988,
zandford,
without
the
prior
knowledge
or
consent
of
wood
and
okstulski,
issued
three
checks
to
himself
totaling
$41,000.
the
checks
were
drawn
on
a
joint
mutual
fund
account
held
by
wood
and
okstulski
outside
of
their
dominick
account,
and
the
funds
represented
therein
were
obtained
through
the
sale
of
mutual
fund
shares--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
think
the
way
that
that
kind
of
account
works
is
that
it's
like
a
checking
account
with
your
mutual
funds.
you
write
the
check,
you
write
the
checks
on
the
account
and
the
redeeming
of
the
check
causes
the
sales
of
the
mutual
funds.
but
regardless
of
whether
it
precisely
states
that,
that's
certainly
a
reasonable
inference
or
facts
that
can
be
proved
based
on
these
allegations
which
is
all
that's
necessary
to
get
past
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint,
your
honor.
and
in
addition
on
the
other
allegations
on
the
next
page
and
the
paragraphs
on
the
next
page,
there
are
description
of
repeated
sales
and
repeated
conversions
over
a
long
period
of
time.
and,
you
know,
one
time
maybe
he
formed
the
intent
after
the
sales,
although
that's
unlikely
given
that
this
happened
after
the
allegations
in
the
previous
paragraph.
but
13
more
times,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it's
hard
to
believe.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
recovery
goes
to
the...
to
the
government,
but
the
sec
has
a
policy
of
if
there
are
identifiable
victims
to
endeavor
to
give
the
victims
those...
those
funds
and
to
make
them
whole
if
they
are
available.
so
here
where
there
are
identifiable
victims,
they
would
do
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
the
restitution,
first
of
all,
the
purposes
of
restitution
and
disgorgement
are
different
in
that
one
is
aimed
on
the...
is
focused
on
the
making
whole
the
loss
to
the...
to
the
people
that
are
injured,
whereas
the
other
is
aimed
at
requiring
the
wrongdoer
to
disgorge
any
benefit
that
he
got
from
the
scheme.
but
in
addition,
your
honor,
the
statute
provides
for
a
civil
action
and
gives
the
sec
the
power
to
do
that
in
order
to
further
its
role
in
ensuring
the
integrity
of
the
markets
and
ensuring
investor
confidence
in
the
markets.
and
it
empowers
the
sec
rather
than
the
individual
u.s.
attorneys
to
determine
when
it's
necessary
to
ask
for
that
kind
of
a
remedy
in
order
to
further
those
purposes.
and
the
sec
properly
made
that
determination,
made
that
determination
here.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
their
record
i
think
establishes
that
they
lost
everything
that
they
had
entrusted
to
him
which
was
420
roughly,
thousands
of
dollars'
worth.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
that
certainly
happens,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
the
sec
does
its
own
balancing
of
what's
appropriate
to
further
the
interests
and
it
asks
for
a
disgorgement
which
is
an
equitable
remedy.
and
the
court
takes
into
account
those
concerns
in
deciding
whether
to
award
it.
and
here
the
district
court
did
determine
that
it
was
appropriate
to
award
disgorgement
in
the
amount
of
$343,000.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
they
do
talk
to
each
other.
but
the
decision,
your
honor,
whether
to
bring
the
prosecution
and
what
to
charge
and
what
to
ask
for
is
the
decision
of
the
prosecutors,
whereas
the
decision
of
what
is
appropriate
to
pursue
as
a
civil
action
in
order
to
further
the
purposes
of
the
securities
laws
is
the
responsibility
of
the
sec.
and
if
the
two
arms
don't
necessarily
agree
that
that
can
all
be
done
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
then
sometimes
a
civil
proceeding
is
necessary
to
accomplish
the
goals
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
um--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
in
theory,
your
honor,
yes.
although
here
in
the
supreme
court
the
solicitor
general
represents
the
sec.
and
in
order
for
the
sec
to
come
here,
the
solicitor
general
has
to
authorize
the
action.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
again,
i'd
like
to
reiterate
that
to
decide
this
case
and
under
the
theory
that
we
are
advancing
here,
you
don't
need
to
reach
that.
but
even
under
the
other
theory
that
i
alluded
to,
there
are
limits
to
what
would
be
covered.
for
instance
a
broker
could
defraud
customers
by
convincing
them
to
pursue
an
investment
advisory
relationship.
and
that
would
not
be...
that
would
not
necessarily
be
covered.
in
addition,
the
broker
might
defraud
the
customers
of
assets
that
are
outside
of
the
brokerage
account
and
that
aren't
securities
because
the
broker
has
developed
a
relationship
of
trust
with
the
customer.
that
wouldn't
be
covered
under
the
other
theory.
in
addition,
the
broker,
i
guess
it's
a
similar
thing,
the
broker
could
defraud
the
customer
into
making
some
other
kind
of
investments,
real
estate
investments,
because
of
the
relationship
of
trust
that
had
developed.
but
the
sec
has
consistently
taken
the
position
that
with
regard
to
brokerage
accounts
and
the
brokerage
relationship
that
involves
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities
and
that
exists
for
the
purpose
of
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities,
that
it
is
a
violation
when
the
broker
defrauds
its
customer.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
would
still
be...
and
then
he...
they
gave
him
the
money
and
he
purchased
securities
and
then
sold
the
securities?
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
would
still
be
a
violation,
your
honor,
because
he
would
have
the
same
fiduciary
relationship
with
them
by
virtue
of
them
making
him
their
agent
for
securities
transactions
and
entrusting
their
assets
to
him
to
engage
in
securities
transactions.
and
when
he
sold
for
the
secret
purpose
of
misappropriating
the
proceeds
rather
than
for
their
benefit,
and
he
did
not
disclose
that
he
was
doing
that,
he
would
be
deceiving
them
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
securities,
just
as
mr.
zandford
did
here.
and
that
would
be
a
violation
under
these
circumstances.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor,
we
didn't
seek
review
of
the
reversal
of
the
summary
judgment.
we
sought
review
of
a
different
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
after
it
reversed
the
summary
judgment,
it
explained
why
it
didn't
think
summary
judgment
could
be
granted,
it
went
on
to
say
that
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
didn't
state
a
claim
under
10(b).
and
that's
what
we
want
reversed.
and
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
facts
in
page
8a
of
the
petition.
the
court
of
appeals
states
in
the
part
of
the
opinion
that's
relevant
here
that
the
sec,
i'm
in
the
middle
paragraph
of
that
page
under
the
b,
and
i
think
it's
the
third
sentence,
says
it,
meaning
the
sec,
alleges
that
zandford
defrauded
the
woods
by
failing
to
inform
them
that
he
intended
to
sell
their
securities
in
order
to
obtain
the
proceeds
for
himself.
so
the
facts
that
the
court
of
appeals
were
considering
are
precisely
the
same
facts
that
we
are
relying
on
here,
your
honor.
and
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--okay.
i
was
just
going
say
that
the
indictment
is
no
different
in
any
event,
and
on
page
41a
in
paragraph
5
of
the
indictment
it
alleged
that
charles
zandford
caused
checks
to
be
issued
against
the
security
positions
of
william
r.
wood
and
diane
okstulski
and
made
payable
to
charles
zandford,
thereby
causing
their
securities
to
be
liquidated.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
says
it
was
part
of
a
scheme
and
artifice
to
defraud.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
so
i
think
that
pretty
well
encompasses
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
okay.
i
would
point
to,
on
page
36
of
our
brief
we
discuss
the
southeastern
securities
corporation
adjudication,
your
honor,
from
1949,
seven
years
after
the
sec
promulgated
rule
10(b).
in
that
case
the
facts
were
that
the
president
and
director
of
the
brokerage
firm
sold
the
customer's
securities
without
her
knowledge
or
consent
and
converted
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
to
his
own
use.
and
after
explaining
that
there
was
a
relationship
of
trust
and
confidence
and
that
he
had
a
fiduciary
duty,
the
sec
addressed
the
argument
that
this
conduct
was
authorized
because
he
had
discretion
over
the
customer's
affairs
by
virtue
of
a
general
power
of
attorney,
and
rejected
that
argument,
noting
that
even
assuming
the
power
of
attorney's
validity,
it
didn't
authorize
this
conduct
absent
a
showing
of
full
and
specific
disclosure
to
and
understanding
consent
by
the
customer.
and
then
the
commission
concluded
that
the
stockbroker's
taking
and
sale
of
the
customer's
securities
and
his
use
of
the
proceeds
constituted
a
willful
abuse
of
his
trust
and
a
violation
of--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
there's
a
violation
at
the
time
of
the
sale.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
discretionary
authority
doesn't
make
the
sale
authorized
because
he's
authorized
only
to
sell
for
the
benefit
of
the
customers.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
two...
two
points
to
address
that
concern,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
as
i
was
discussing
with
justice
ginsburg
earlier,
when
there
is...
a
private
action
requires
proof
of
damages.
and
if
the
broker
doesn't
follow
through
with
his
plan
to
convert
the
proceeds,
there
will
be...
it
will
be
frequently
the
case
that
the
customer
can't
show
damages
and
needs
to
be
able
to
allege
those
as
a
required
part
of
the
action,
couldn't
bring
it
at
all,
end
of
case.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
right.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor.
under
the
private
securities
litigation
reform
act,
the
plaintiff
has
to
state
with
particularity
facts
giving
rise
to
a
strong
inference
that
the
defendant
acted
with
the
requisite
fraudulent
state
of
mind.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor.
only
secret
or
deceptive
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty
are
frauds.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
many
of
them,
particularly
breaches
of
the
duty
of
loyalty
will
be
secret,
your
honor.
but
not
every
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
is
going
to
be...
is
going
to
be
secret
or
knowing.
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
care
wouldn't
even
be
knowing
necessarily.
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fairness
as
in
the
santa
fe
case
where
all
the
factors
disclosed
would
not
be
deceptive,
there
would
be
no
violation.
but
in
o'hagan,
the
court
explained
that
when
the...
when
a
fiduciary
pretends
loyalty
to
the
principal
and
instead
embezzles
the
principal's
property,
that's
a
fraud.
and
that's
a
fraud--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--this
is...
this
is
just
like
a
standard
churning
case,
your
honor.
a
churning
case
is
one--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
you
are
not
addressing
churning
because
obviously
that's
not
here.
but
i
think
that
the
courts
of
appeal
have
unanimously
concluded
that
churning
is
a
violation.
and
that's
because
the
broker
who
has
control
over
the
account
and
who's
been
entrusted
with
trading
authority
by
the
customer
is
making
the
trades,
not
in
furtherance
of
the
customer's
investment
objectives
but
in
furtherance
of
the
broker's
aim
of
gaining
commission.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
again,
your
honor,
churning
is...
it's
a
different...
it's
a
different
factual
scenario
because
there
are
repeated
sales
and
because
the
proceeds
aren't
taken.
and
i
suppose
that
a
distinction
could
be
drawn
between
when
the
proceeds
are
taken
and
if
the
proceeds...
if
it
isn't
a
question
of
taking
the
proceeds
but
just
making
a
commission,
which
the
customer
knows
that
the
broker
is
doing.
but
i
do
think
this
would
be
strong
precedent
in
support
of
those
cases.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
not
particularly.
i
was
acknowledging
that
i
think
this
would
be
strong
precedent.
but
i...
respondent
concedes
that
churning
is
covered,
the
courts
of
appeals
unanimously
have
held
that
churning
is
covered.
i
have
no
doubt
that
churning
is
covered.
the
sec
has
no
doubt
that
churning
is
covered.
so
you
wouldn't
be
breaking...
wouldn't
be
breaking
new
ground
in
holding
that.
i
mean,
it
would
be
in
the
sense
that
it
would
be
your
decision,
but
you
can
make
the
distinctions
in
future
cases
that
you
feel
are
appropriate
and
necessary,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
the
government
would
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
