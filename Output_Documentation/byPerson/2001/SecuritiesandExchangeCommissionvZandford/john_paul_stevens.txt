justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
are
going
back
to
the
indictment
and
ignoring
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
course
of
conduct,
one
transaction
after
another
is
relevant;
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
is
there
any
proof
that
any
of
the
proceeds
were
ever
given
to
the
owner
of
the
principal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
for
purposes
of
their
affirmative
motion
for
summary
judgment.
they
could
then
say
these
facts
are
established.
that's
not
a
sufficient
reason
for
granting
summary
judgment
the
other
way
around.
justice
john
paul
stevens
therefore,
we
should
not
ignore
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
that
go
beyond
the
indictment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
because
they
were
trying
to
win
outright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
doesn't
justify
your
winning
outright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
with
one.
the
question
presented
is
whether
when
the
stockbroker
sells
his
customer's
certain
securities
for
his
own
benefit.
now,
do
we
have
to
assume
he
sold
them
for
his
own
benefit
at
the
time
the
sale
was
made
or
are
you
saying
in
fact
he
sold
them
for
his
principal's
benefit
and
later
decided
to
appropriate
the
proceeds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
there's
no
proof
but
the
question
we
are
asked
to
decide
is
when
he
does
it
for
his
own
benefit
is
it
a
violation
of
10(b)4?
that's
what
the
question
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what's
your
answer
to
the
question?
your
answer
to
the
question
is
he
didn't
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it's
a
sale
for
his
own
benefit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
sale
was
for
his
own
benefit
at
the
time
he
made
the
sale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
filed
a
civil
complaint
alleging
that
a
stock
broker
violated
section
10(b)
of
the
1934
act
by
selling
his
customer’s
securities
and
using
the
proceeds
for
his
won
benefit
without
the
customer’s
knowledge
or
consent.
the
question
that
is
presented
to
us
is
whether
the
alleged
fraudulent
conduct
was
“in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security”
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
the
implementing
rule
10b-5.
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
the
sales
of
securities
were
incidental
to
a
scheme
that
was
simply
to
steal
his
customer’s
assets
rather
than
to
engage
in
manipulation
of
a
particular
security.
for
reason
stated
in
an
11
page
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
at
the
court,
we
disagree
and
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals,
and
our
decision
is
unanimous.
