mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
do
not
dispute,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
disputed,
that
this
conduct
obviously
is
covered
by
any
number
of
laws,
civil,
criminal,
state,
federal,
the
rules
of
this
self-regulatory
organization,
and
the
court
below
recognized
that
as
well.
but
it
treated
the
question
of
whether
or
not
mr.
zandford
was
also
liable
under
section
10(b)
as
a
different
question
requiring
a
specific
proof.
and
it
is
that
proof
that
the
court
found
wanting.
in
that
regard,
i
think
it's
also
important
that
one
of
the
pivotal
factors
in
our
theory
of
the
case
was
that
this
was
a
discretionary
account.
and
the
sec
was
relying
on
the
bare
facts
alleged
in
the
wire
fraud
indictment
to
prove
its
case.
and
under
those
circumstances,
there
was
no
investment
decision
being
made
by
the
victims
in
this
case.
and
we
argued
to
the
court
below
and
we
submit
to
this
court
that
that's
a
pivotal
distinction
in
10(b)
context.
because
10(b)
deals
with
investment
decisions.
and
if
no
one
is
being
defrauded
in
the
decision
they
are
making
as
to
the
purchase
or
sale,
all
that
leaves
the
sec
with
in
this
case
is
the
conversion
of
the
proceeds.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that's
also
correct.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
think
so,
because
those
allegations
were
not
being
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
the
sec
at
various
points
has
indicated
in
its
pleadings
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
indictment
were
the
same
as
the
complaint,
and
that
may
have
caused
part
of
the
problem.
but
the
only
facts
alluded
to
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
you
indicated
is
in
effect
granting
summary
judgment
to
the
non-moving
party.
in
that
regard,
there's
no
reference
at
all
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
referring
to
any
of
the
facts
in
the
complaint.
they
refer
to
the
indictment.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
may
well
be
the
case.
the
problem
we
have
with
that
is
the
question
of
issue
preservation.
when
the
sec
petitioned
for
rehearing,
ordinarily...
in
the
ordinary
case,
if
you
reverse
an
order
granting
summary
judgment,
you
obviously
don't
grant
summary
judgment
to
the
non-moving
party;
you
remand
for
further
proceedings.
but
when
the
sec
moved
for
rehearing
and
rehearing
en
banc,
it
did
not
raise
the
issue
with
the
court
as
to
why
it
had
remanded
with
instructions
to
dismiss.
so
on
this
record
you
really
don't
know
what
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
was.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
ginsburg,
my
point
is,
is
that
the
question
that
i
think
that
is
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
sec
by
its
own
actions
limited
itself
to
the
facts
asserted
for
purposes
of
summary
judgment
which
were
the
facts
in
the
indictment.
now,
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
operating
under
the
assumption
that
that
was
their
case,
it
could,
if
that
was
their
case
and
it
was
clear
that
was
what
it
had
to
consider,
if
it
concluded
those
facts
were
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
would
be
the
only
rationale
in
light
of
its
opinion
which
only
considered
the
facts
in
the
indictment.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
yes,
i
did.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
challenged
the...
in
our
brief
in
opposition,
we
challenged
any
consideration
of
any
facts
beyond
the
indictment,
that
any
issue
with
regard
to
facts
in
the
complaint
were
not
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
were
not
relied
on
by
the
sec.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
absolutely
agree.
but
the
question
is
not
so
much
whether
that
was
of
the
making
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
whether
that
was
of
the
making
of
the
sec.
and
i
think
it
was
the
court's
understanding
that
that
was
the
sec's
position,
that
they
were
narrowing
themselves
to
the
indictment,
and
that's
what
the
court
considered.
but
regardless,
even
with
the
facts,
i
mean,
if
i'm
wrong
on
that,
regardless
of
the
facts
even
with
the
facts
that
the
sec
relies
on
from
the
complaint,
you
essentially
have
the
same
problem.
and
again,
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
this
conduct
is
covered.
it's
covered
under
the
broker
rules.
but
for
purposes
of
10(b)
as
the
sec
now
concedes,
this
would
also
affect
private
actions.
and
in
that
regard,
these
facts
simply
do
not
meet
the
paradigm
for
a
10(b)
violation
which
is
either
that
somebody
is
duped
into
buying
or
selling
a
security,
a
particular
security,
because
that's
the
paradigm
for
the
statute,
or
in
limited
circumstances
such
as
a
case
like
o'hagan,
where
it
affects
market
integrity,
the
court
has
also
found
liability.
but
that's
in
a
situation--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--under
that
theory,
i
would
submit
there
is
a
fraud.
that
is
unauthorized
to
take
the
money
in
that
situation
and
he's
duped
into
turning
over
the
securities
to
the
broker,
and
there
is
an
investment
decision
being
made.
but
you
have
a
particular--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--in
that
circumstance,
if
he
then
sells
the
security
and
places
it
in
the
account,
then
he
has
completed
the
instructions.
but
if
he
sells
the
security
and
converts
it
to
his
own
use,
then
i
believe
you
don't
have
in
that
situation,
in
other
words,
if
those
are
the
instructions
from
the
client
to
the
broker...
i
correct
myself.
that
would
not
be
a
10(b)e
violation.
it
will
be
a
violation
of
the
broker
rules.
it
will
be
a
conversion.
it
will
be
a
criminal
act.
but
there
will
be
no
fraud.
he
will
have
carried
out
the
instructions
to
sell
the
stock.
there's
no
inducement
there
to
sell--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--understood.
but
nor
were...
the
instructions
were
to
sell
the
stock.
he
is
not
being
duped
into
selling
the
stock.
that
is
exactly
what
he
wanted
done.
what
he's
being
duped
into
is
the
proceeds
are
being
converted.
but
the
difference
with
bankers
life
is
that
the
10(b)
violator
in
that
case
actually
goes
to
the
person
and
says
we
should
sell
this,
with
the
intent
of
diverting
the
proceeds.
that
person
is
duped
into
believing
by
the
actor
that
they
are
making
the
sale
with
the
understanding
that
they
will
get
the
proceeds.
again
it...
for
purposes
of--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--i
think
the
difference
is
for
purposes
of
the
10(b)
paradigm
it
requires
that
the
sale
be
induced
by
the
broker
for
fraudulent
reasons.
if
all
he's
doing
is
converting
the
proceeds--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--justice
breyer,
here
is
the
distinction
that
i
would
draw.
in
the
bankers
life
situation
where
you
have
the
sale
induced,
the
10(b)
violation
is
complete
when
the
sale
is
made.
in
the
situation
you
describe,
until
and
unless
the
broker,
having
followed
the
instructions
and
sold
the
stock,
until
and
unless
he
actually
converts
the
proceeds
to
his
own
use,
you
don't
have
a
10(b)
violation.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
because
until
and
unless
he
actually
converts
the
proceeds,
he
hasn't
violated
10(b).
he
has
not
done
anything
against
his
client's
instructions.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
my
point
is
that
until
he
actually
converts,
while
that
money
is
still
in
the
acccount,
while
the
stock
has
been
sold
consistent
with
the
directions,
until
and
unless
he
actually
converts
the
proceeds
to
his
own
use,
he
has
not
violated
10(b).
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
think
that
would
be
covered
by
10(b).
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
scalia,
the
reason
why
that
doesn't
work
here
is
because
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
establish
that
the
sales
themselves
were
inconsistent
with
the
client's
interests.
regardless
of
what
zandford
may
have
been
thinking,
the
evidence
simply
showed
that
they
were
sold.
he
has
discretionary
power
to
do
it--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--it
might
be
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
in
the
trust
sense.
it
does
not
affect
the
sale
unless
you
can
establish
that
the
sale
is
unauthorized,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
client's
interest.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
but
the
sale
itself
was
authorized.
the
only
point
i'm
bringing
out
is
in
a
situation
like
bankers
life
where
the
broker
induces
the
sale
with
fraudulent
intent,
you
have
a
complete
violation
when
the
stock
is
sold.
it
makes
no
difference
after
that
whether
the
broker
is
successful
or
unsuccessful
in
diverting
the
proceeds.
you
have
established
a
fraudulent
sale
in
which
an
investor's
decision
has
been
induced
by
fraudulent
intent.
in
the
situation
where
the
sale
is
authorized,
either
because
the
client
calls
the
broker
and
says
i
want
you
to
sell
xyz
corporation
today,
and
the
broker
does
that--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--in
that
situation,
regardless
of
what
the
broker
is
thinking,
he
may
be
thinking
i'm
going
to
take
the
money
and
run.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
no,
but--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--justice
scalia,
in
that
regard
we
point
to
two
decisions
from
the
7th
circuit
in
o'brien
and
congregation
that
deal
with
discretionary
accounts.
and
when
a
client
turns
money
over
to
an
investment
counselor
or
broker
and
says,
you
make
the
decisions,
i'm
giving
you
blanket
authority,
and
that's
what
we
have
in
this
record;
in
that
situation,
that
takes
you
out
of
the
10(b)
paradigm.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that's
correct.
not
every
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
is
a
fraud,
and
not
every
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
will
violate
10(b).
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
souter,
my
answer
to
that
is
this:
if
it
is
shown,
in
other
words,
assuming
you
have
a
discretionary
account
to
invest
conservatively,
if
a
broker
then
goes
and
buys
a
penny
stock,
that
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
discretionary
authorization
and
it
would
be
a
violation
of
10(b).
what
the--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--yes,
it
was
outside
the
scope
of
the
authority.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
here
was
that
that
was
not
established.
with
regard
to
the
various
sales,
when
these
checks
were
written,
the
court
concluded
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
conclude
that
those
sales--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--in
either
situation
if
you
can
show
that
the
sale
itself
is
a
violation
of
that
authorization
or
a
breach
of
it,
yes.
but
in
this
case
the
court
was
very
careful
on
that
in
saying
not
only
that
this
was
a
discretionary
account,
but
in
light
of
the
allegations
in
the
indictment
there
was
just
no
proof
in
the
record
that
any
of
these
sales
were
in
violation--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--even
with
the
complaint
there's
really
nothing
in
the
complaint
that
they
are
relying
on
other
than
the
mutual
fund
account,
and
again--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--not
given
the
time
factor.
and
we
are
not
talking...
the
time
factor
is
actually
from
march
of
'88
to
september
of
'90.
and
in
that
regard
there's
just
nothing
in
the
record...
we
don't
even
know
what
the
securities
were
that
were
bought
or
sold.
and
that's
the
problem
with
their
theory
of
this
case.
it's
overarching
in
where
it
goes.
there's
no
proof
that
any
of
these
sales
were
not
consistent
with
the
authorization,
were
not
in
the
client's
interests.
and
they
didn't
attempt
to
prove
it.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
the
proof
is
that
the
proceeds
go
to
three
contracts
that
were
determined
by
the
jury
in
the
wire
fraud
case
to
be
fraudulent
that
are
agreements
that
were
between
zandford
and
the
clients.
one
was
a
personal
loan,
one
was
an
investment
that
the
court
determined
to
be
fraudulent.
that's
where
the
fraud
takes
place.
that's
where
the
conversion
takes
place,
not
sooner,
under
our
theory
and
under
what
the
court
found.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
scalia.
and
i
don't
believe
that
was
their
theory
in
the
indictment.
the
checks
were
written
on
the
account
but
he
had
authority
to
do
that.
there's
no--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--indication
that
was
wrong--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--positions
were
liquidated
in
order
to
pay
the
checks.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
but
there's
no
indication
that
those
sales
were
not
a
deliberate
decision
to
sell
those
securities
at
that
point
to
take
the
money
and
put
it
into
something
else.
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
that
was
unauthorized
to
do
that.
because
we
don't
know
what
the
thoughts
were.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
well,
the
sequence
of
the
check
is
to
take
the
money
out
of
the
account
and
invest
it
otherwise,
which
is
why
you
would
do
it
that
way
or
could
do
it
that
way.
but
we
know
very
little
about
it.
but
there's
nothing--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--well,
it
was
payable
to
the
broker
or
accounts
controlled
by
the
broker.
but
as
the
evidence
establishes
in
the
record
on
affirming
the
appeal
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
claim,
the
money
went
into
other
investments.
and
that's
what
zandford's
defense
was.
these
were
other
legitimate
investments
and
that's
what
i
was
doing
with
the
money,
and
they
knew
about
it
and
that's
what
that
was.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
well,
they...
the
way
they
describe
it,
it
goes
to
accounts
controlled
by
zandford.
so
they
do
indicate
that
the
conversion
of
the
proceeds
into
other
investments
was
fraudulent.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
if
the
writing
of
the
check
is
unauthorized,
it's
going
to
be
a
10b-5
violation.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
then
it
would
be
a
10b-5e
violation.
what
the
court
found
lacking
here
was
any
evidence
that
the
sale
itself
of
the
securities
by
the
writing
of
the
check
established
a
10b-5--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--under
my
theory,
that
would
allege
it.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
but
the
court
of
appeals
found--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--no,
justice
breyer,
that's
not
right.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
because
two
things.
one,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
because
it
was
a
discretionary
account,
that
there
was
anything
unauthorized
about
it.
there
wasn't
any
consent
needed.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
in
the
ordinary
course
i
would
agree
with
that.
all
other
things
being
equal,
that
would
be
the
result.
but
if
in
fact
the
sec
by
its
litigation
posture
chose
to
rest
exclusively
on
the
criminal
indictment,
this
other
case--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--it
doesn't
say
that.
there
are
representations
that
the
criminal
case
is
the
same
as
the
civil
case.
at
the
time
of
our
argument
in
this
case,
we
argued
to
the
court
that
if
this
is
all
they
have,
if
the
criminal
indictment
is...
yes,
in
the
court
of
appeals.
if
this
is
all
they
have,
then
there's
nothing
to
send
it
back
for.
because
this
evidence
in
the
criminal
case--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--justice
breyer,
i
think
that--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--obviously
these
are
very
hard
facts
to
argue.
but
my
point
is,
he
went
to
jail
for
almost
five
years.
it
violates
all
sorts
of
rules,
provisions,
statutes,
there's
no
question
about
this.
this
conduct
is
controlled.
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
doubt
about
that.
but
a
10(b)
violation
is
different.
and
also
the
sec's
litigation
posture
is
different.
if
they
are
going
to
give
up
the
facts
in
the
complaint
and
argue
the
case
on
the
indictment,
in
a
strategical
attempt
to
get
the
court
to
rule
the
way
they
want,
which
is
the
broadest
possible
10(b),
then
they
have
got
to
live
with
it.
and
when
the
fact--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--i
absolutely
agree,
justice
stevens,
and
our
only
point
there
is--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--the
only
objection
i
have
to
that
is
the
fact
that
they
sought
rehearing
and
they
sought
rehearing
and
bond,
and
not
one
word
was
mentioned
about
a
remand
for
dismissal.
they
were
still
arguing
collateral
estoppel
and
on
the
facts
of
the
indictment
we
win
outright.
they
did
not
even
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that's
right.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
when
they
file...
of
course.
there's
no
question
that
both
sides
agree
that
bankers
life
and
o'hagan
control
and
we
say
it's
clear
we
win.
that's
the
normal
case.
but
when
they
don't
seek
rehearing
on
that
basis
so
this
court
doesn't
even
know
why
the
court
of
appeals
did
what
it
did,
and
when
they
file
for
certiori
and
don't
raise
that
as
a
claim
for
reversing
or--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--what
i'm
saying
is
when
this
comes
up
for
the
first
time
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
file
for
rehearing,
and
they
don't
even
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
so
that
the
court
can
determine
whether
there
is
something
to
be
corrected
or
whether
this
is
the
court's
understanding
from
oral
argument
that
is
what
their
case
is.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
they
did
not
even
mention
it.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
ordinarily
i
would
absolutely
agree,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
when
it's
something
that
comes
up
in
the
opinion
from
the
court
of
appeals
that
on
its
face
doesn't
have
any
explanation
that
basically
says
instead
of
going
back
so
you
can
prove
your
case,
we're
throwing
it
out
completely,
and
they
don't
say
a
word
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that's
the
wrong
remedy.
i
mean,
that's
the
first
thing--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--the
court
concluded--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--the
point
was
that
the
securities
were
incidental
to
this
fraud.
they
were
not
an
integral
part
of
it,
and--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--justice
stevens,
what
i
am
saying
is
there
is
no
proof
in
this
record
that
at
the
time
of
the
sales--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--i
understand
that,
justice
stevens,
and--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--my
answer
to
the
question
is
it
is
authorized
sale,
either
on
the
instructions
of
the--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--and
at
the
same
time
it
is
also
consistent
with
the
client's
instructions,
until
he
converts,
he
has
not
violated
10(b).
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
even
though
he...
if
it
is
for
his
own
benefit...
in
other
words,
it
could
be
both
at
the
same
time.
at
the
time
of
the
sale,
if
the
client
calls
you
and
says
sell
my
xyz
stock,
i
want
it
sold
today,
and
you
sell
it
with
the
intent
to
convert
the
proceeds,
that
sale
is
not
simply
for
the
broker's
benefit.
it
is
consistent
with
the
instructions.
it
is
an
authorized
sale.
until
and
unless
he
actually
converts
the
proceeds,
he
has
violated
nothing.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
would
disagree,
justice
souter.
on
this
record
it
may
well
be
that
it
was
for
his
benefit,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
conclude
it
was
not
for
his
client's
benefit
as
well.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
as
i
understand
it--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--justice
scalia,
assuming...
and
because
my
time
has
run
out...
assuming
that
congress
in
fact
delegated
the
discretion
to
the
agency,
i
don't
think
you
can
find
in
any
of
the
various
things
that
they
rely
on,
any
rule
dealing
with
10(b)
or
section
10b-5
that
speaks
to
the
precise
issues
that
are
raised
in
this
case
or
even
close
to
them.
what
they
do
is
they
have
rules
that
in
16
or
so
cases,
or
whatever
the
number,
they
have
prosecuted
for
10(b)
violations
brokers
who
convert.
but
they
are
not
necessarily,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
don't
recall
any
of
them
being
discretionary
accounts
or
presenting
the
type
of
10(b)
analysis,
fraud
in
connection
with
a
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
is
correct.
assuming
there
is
deference,
there's
nothing
to
defer
it
to,
and
if
there
was,
it
would
be
a
rule
that
they
are
ultimately
asking
for
that
a
broker
any
time
they
convert
from
the
account
violates
10(b)
and
that
would
be
arbitrary.
that
is
not
the
way
this
rule
is
applied.
it
is
applied
on
a
careful
case-by-case
basis.
so
whichever
way
you
go
on
that,
i
don't
think
it
gets
them
the
deference
they
seek.
i
would
add,
however,
with
the
little
time
that
i
have
left,
that
i
do
not
believe
they
would
get
that
deference.
on
churning,
justice
ginsburg,
just
to
get
to
that
point,
in
a
churning
case,
i
think
that
is
more
the
o'hagan
paradigm.
you
consummate
the
fraud
through
the
sale
itself.
it
is
the
sale
that
completes
the
violation.
it
is
the
sale
that
consummates
the
violation
of
fiduciary
duty.
that's
the
difference
between
here
and
a
churning
case.
until
and
unless
zandford
converts
those
proceeds,
which
is
done
through
agreements
that
are
outside
the
scope
of
the
securities
laws,
he
has
not
violated
10(b).
in
a
churning
case,
the
sale
itself
consummates
it
and
it
meets
the
other
conditions
that
are
required
in
o'hagan.
that
is
a
different
situation
and
it
is
also
established,
of
course,
in
that
situation
through
the
pattern
of
sales
you
have
the
proof
that
you
don't
have
here,
which
is
that
those
sales
were
not
in
the
client's
interests.
if
you
cannot
establish
that
they--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--thank
you.
