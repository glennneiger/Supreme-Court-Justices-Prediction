mr.
roberts,
there's
one
point
in
your
reply
brief
that
i
didn't
quite
grasp.
this
action
is
brought
by
the
sec.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
hinges
on
the
wrong
that
was
done
to
the
customer.
could
the
customer
bring
this
very
lawsuit,
could
the
customer
have
sued
the
broker
for
a
10(b)
violation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
time
he
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
another
curiosity
in
this
case.
there
was
a
prosecution
for
wire
fraud,
the
restitution
sought
was
$10,800.
and
now
the
sec
is
going
after
the
broker
for
a
much
larger
sum.
why
wasn't
a
greater
sum
asked
in
the
wire
fraud
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
gets
the
recovery,
mr.
roberts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
odd
that
there
was
no
kind
of,
apparently
no
cooperation
here,
that
the
criminal
case
goes
on
for
that
limited
amount
and
then
the
sec
comes
in
after.
don't
the
relevant
prosecutors
talk
to
each
other
in
advance
about
a
case
like
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
limit,
if
we
have
a
broker,
a
licensed
broker,
is
there
any
limit
at
all
or
just
any
fraud
by
a
licensed
broker
falls
within
10(b)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the...
suppose
zandford
were
not
a
licensed
broker,
he
just
was
pretending
to
be
a
broker
but
he
wasn't
at
all.
he
went
to
these
people
and
said,
i'm
a
broker,
give
me
your
money;
and
the
same
thing
happened?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
he's
not
licensed
to
sell
any.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
they
have
to,
mr.
goldblatt?
this...
a
complaint
to
be
thrown
out
when
there's
been
nothing
beyond
the
complaint
doesn't...
mustn't
you
listen
to
the
facts
as
pled
in
the
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
case
of
churning
would
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
goldblatt,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
didn't
turn
on
issue
preclusion,
it
turned
on
a
notion
that
in
order
to
have
a
violation
of
10(b)
you
had
to
have
some
kind
of
misleading
about
the
merits
of
a
certain
security,
something
tied
to
the
security,
and
not
that
they
regarded
this
as
a
common
law
crime
as
theft.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
the
point
they
made
was
it's
the
same
as
if
what
was
entrusted
to
the
broker
were
a
car
and
he
sold
the
car
for
himself
instead
of
the
customer.
