william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
do
you
say
then
that
any
fraud
by
a
broker
in
connection
with
a
customer
is
actionable
by
the
sec.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
take
what
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
quite
a
leap--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that's
a
leap
from
any
case
we've
ever
decided.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
were
misrepresentations
about
a
particular
security.
that
didn't
happen
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
it
a
little
odd,
you
have
two
different
branches
of
the
government,
perhaps
not
branches,
but
two
different
proceedings,
one
a
criminal
proceeding
which
authorizes
restitution.
and
in
that
proceeding
the
decision
was
made
that
$10,000
would
be
allowed,
awarded
in
restitution.
then
the
sec
comes
along
and
says,
no,
that
wasn't
enough.
we
want
to
get,
you
know,
several
hundred
thousand
more.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
the
family
has
needs,
the
sec
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
it,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
goldblatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
sec
as
i
understand
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
in
effect
granted
summary
judgment
for
mr.
zandford.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
have
to
take
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
as
true
at
that
point
i
think,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
should
there
have
been
some
reference
to
the
facts
in
the
complaints
since
they
were
about
to
render
summary
judgment
against
the
sec?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
government's
petition
here
sets
forth
some
facts.
the
stockbroker
sells
his
customers
for
his
own
benefit.
and
so
it...
and
in
your
brief
in
opposition
you
didn't
challenge
that
question,
did
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
did?
what
did
you
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
just
seems
weird
in
a
way.
i
mean,
this
is
a
civil
action.
and
to
insist
that
it
be
tried
on
the
facts
and
an
indictment
in
the
criminal
case
as
opposed
to
as
alleged
in
a
complaint
in
this
very
case
seems
odd.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
true
in
effect
that
not
every
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
is
a
fraud.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
we
don't
know
the
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
did
what
it
did,
i
mean,
it
wrote
an
opinion,
which
usually
gives
the
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
did
what
it
did.
are
you
complaining
that
they
didn't
say
anything
on
rehearing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
saying
that
the
government
didn't
raise
this
issue
in
their
petition
for
rehearing
to
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
don't
know
that
they
have
to.
i
mean,
so
long
as
they
properly
petition
here,
i
don't
know
that
you
need
have
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldblatt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts.
mr.
roberts,
the
government
wants
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
here,
i'm
sure.
but
does
it
want
the
summary
judgment
granted
by
the
district
court
for
the
sec
affirmed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
every
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
is
a
fraud
under
10(b)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
most
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty
secret?
i
mean,
you
don't
announce
that
you
are
breaching
a
fiduciary
duty.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
the
case
is
submitted.
