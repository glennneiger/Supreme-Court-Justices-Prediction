does
the
sec
routinely
audit
brokers'
accounts
or
do
spot
audits
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
theory
you
are
suggesting
here
or
are
they
just
reactive
when
they
find
out
about
a
firm?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
that
if
the
nasd
tells
the
sec
of
the
existence
of
a
fraud,
the
sec
can
then
request
the
united
states
government
to
prosecute
if
there
is
a
wire
fraud
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
to
explore
the
point,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
these
victims
lost
only
$10,000
and
that
the
broker
just
made
all
the
rest
by
churning--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
the
customer
comes
to
the
broker
and
says,
here's
100
shares
of
the
abc
company,
sell
these
shares
for
me
and
put
the
money
in
your
broker
account.
and
the
broker,
before
he
sells,
has
the
intent
to
take
the
money
for
the
broker's
own
account.
is
there
a
fraud
under
your
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
he's
made
the
investment
decision
in
my
hypothetical.
he
said,
i
don't
want
your
advice
about
selling.
you
sell
these
things.
i'm
directing
you
to
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
only
in
really
a
pickwickian
sense
of
the
term.
he
carried
out
the
instructions
to
sell
the
stock
but
he
keeps
the
money.
nobody
would
construe
the
instructions
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
let
me
just
see
what
your
theory
is
here.
suppose
the
way
it
works
is
that
there's
a
mutual
fund
account
and
the
broker
decides,
i
want
to
take
this
money
for
my
own
purposes
to
spend
on
a
pleasure
cruise.
i
write
the
check
that
causes
the
sale
of
the
security.
under
your
theory,
is
there
a
10b-5
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
everybody
knows
he
didn't...
the
client
didn't
authorize
the
broker
to
take
a
pleasure
cruise.
that's
my
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
a
standard
churning
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
happens
with
standard
churning
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
there
authority
that
this
is
a
10b-5
violation--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
it's
a
given
or
are
we
holding
that
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
this
case
will
be
authority
which
validates
all
of
the
circuit
opinions
holding
that
churning
is
a
violation.
