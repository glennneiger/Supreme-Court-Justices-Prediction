justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
that
differ
from
here?
i
thought
here
that
what
our
facts
that
we
are
assuming
are
that
the
stockbroker
says
to
the
client,
i
have
control
of
your
account
and
i'll
sell
for
your
benefit.
that's
the
implicit
instruction.
the
client
says
sell
for
my
benefit.
and
here
the
stockbroker
sells
for
his
own
benefit.
what's
the
difference
between
that
case
which
is
this
one,
and
the
one
justice
kennedy
is
putting?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
here
we
also
have,
as
they
have
emphasized
about
50
times,
not
simply
stealing.
what
we
have
is
a
sale
of
stock
where
the
stockbroker
has
the
intent
when
he
sells
the
stock
to
keep
the
money,
contrary
to
what
the
implicit
assumption
is
about
what
the
client
wants.
now,
that
seems
to
be
a
little
extra
thing
here
so
we
don't
have
to
reach
all
these
broad
issues.
now,
what
do
we...
that's
what
i
find
indistinguishable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
don't
you?
i
mean,
if
we
could
ever
prove
it?
suppose
in
fact
the
broker,
because
we
had
a
mind-reading
machine,
sold
the
stock
in
order
to
convert
the
proceeds,
puts
the
money
in
the
account
and
then
dies.
i
mean,
you
know,
it's
a
little
weird,
but
nonetheless
if
we
could
ever
prove
such
a
thing,
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
violation
of
10b-5?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
hasn't?
he
has
converted...
he
has
sold
the
shares,
contrary
to
the
instruction,
sell
them
for
my
benefit,
for
his
own
benefit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
alleged
properly.
i
mean,
i
read
on
page
29a,
in
july...
there's
a
misprint
in
the
paragraph,
but
in
july
1998
zandford
without
the
prior
knowledge
or
consent
of...
must
be
of
wood...
sold
three
securities
in
the
wood
account
for
a
total
of
$145,000.
what
their
claim
is,
is
that
without
the
client's
consent,
the
broker
sold
the
securities
and
then
after
that
he
used
the
proceeds
for
himself.
all
right.
now,
on
your
theory,
that
alleges
a
violation
of
the
securities
law.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
then
the
correct
thing
of
disposition
in
your
view
of
this
case,
since
the
allegation
is
there,
and
since
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
criminal
case
didn't
investigate
this
matter
about
whether
it
was
or
without
the
client's
consent,
your
view
is
we
should
have
a
remand
so
that
they
can
have
a
trial
on
the
question
of
whether
mr.
wood
did
consent
to
the
sale.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
there
was
no
evidence.
that's
because
the
government
relied
upon
the
criminal
case.
so
the
court
of
appeals
says
they
are
wrong
to
rely
on
that.
then
as
you
pointed
out
at
the
beginning,
the
correct
result
is
to
send
it
back
so
now
the
government
has
a
chance
to
put
in
other
evidence,
if
you
are
right
about
what
the
evidence
shows.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
there
is
something
in
this
record
where
the
sec
says,
by
the
way,
if
this
criminal
case
does
not
provide
sufficient
evidence,
we
do
not
intend
to
put
in
any
other
evidence.
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
it's
going
to
be
agreed
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
retarded
individual
of
a
very
advanced
age
agreed
that
his
securities
would
be
sold
for
the
purpose
of
the
broker
running
off
with
the
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
say
that
with
some
sarcasm
in
my
voice,
because
it
sounds
to
me
incredible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
doesn't
say
it
was
without
their
consent.
nowhere
in
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
true.
that's
true.
