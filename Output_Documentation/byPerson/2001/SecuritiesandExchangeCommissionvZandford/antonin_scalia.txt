justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
could
you
clarify
for
me
what
the
government's
position
is
in
this
case?
suppose...
suppose
that
the
broker
had
not,
when
he
sold
the
stock,
intended
to
embezzle
but
then
he
made
the
sale
and
the
sale
enabled
his
embezzling.
after
selling
it,
he
conceived
the
scheme
to
embezzle.
is
it
the
government's
position
that
in
that
situation
a
10(b)
would
still
cover
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
have
to
agree
with
that
to
rule
for
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--now,
the
sec
adjudications
that
you
rely
upon,
what
kind
of
a
situation
do
they
involve?
do
they
all
involve--
justice
antonin
scalia
--both
situations.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
did
the
allegations
of
your
complaint
in
this
case
accord
with
the
narrower
theory
that
you
now
say
is
enough
to
decide
this
case?
that
is
to
say,
as
i
read
your
description
of
the
complaint,
it
did
not
say
that
the
sales
of
the
security
were
made
with
the
intention
at
the
time
the
sales
were
made
of
absconding
with
the
proceeds.
all
it
said
is
that
he
sold
the
securities
and
stole
the
funds.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
excuse
me.
he
wrote
the
checks
before
the
sales
were
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
they
were
later
obtained.
it
just
says
they
were
obtained.
i
don't
see
that
that
says
that
the
funds
weren't
there
until
the...
until
the
checks
were
written.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
sec
is
an
independent
regulatory
agency,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
within
the
control
of
the
president?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
the
justice
department
disagrees
with
the
sec,
the
sec
can
still
go
off
on
its
own.
is
that
the
way
the
scheme
works
in
theory?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
about,
never
mind
the
taking
of
the
proceeds.
suppose
you
have
a
broker
who
for
some
reason
because
he
has
an
interest
in
a
company
or
something
else
sells
stock
in
a
customer's
account
where
it
didn't
really
make
sense
to
sell
it.
the
only
benefit
from
selling
it
is
a
benefit
for
the
broker
himself.
his
brother-in-law
is
with
a
company
that
would
profit
from
this
sale
of
the
stock.
would
that
be
covered
by
10(b)?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
isn't
that
the
same
situation
here?
because
this
sale
was
not
a
sale...
never
mind
the
later
theft...
the
sale
was
not
a
sale
for
the
benefit
of
the
customer
which
is
what
he's
promised
to
do.
he's
promised,
i'll
manage
these
stocks
for
your
benefit.
and
here
he
sells
them
when
the
customer's
interest
did
not
call
for
a
sale.
the
only
reason
the
sale
happened
is
that
the
broker
had
his
own
interest
in
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
does
it
have
to
be
inconsistent?
do
you
have
to
prove
that
they
were
inconsistent
with
the
interest
or
is
it
enough
to
prove
that
the
broker
did
not
act
in
the
customer's
interest?
isn't
that
enough
for
the
breach
of
the
fiduciary
duty?
even
if
it
turns
out
that,
what
do
you
know,
it
was
a
good
idea
to
sell,
the
market
crashes,
nonetheless
he
was
guilty
of
a
fiduciary
breach
if
he
didn't
sell
it
because
he
thought
it
would
help
the
customer
but
he
thought
it
would
help
him.
wouldn't
that
be
a
breach
right
then
and
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
unauthorized.
i
didn't
authorize
him
to
sell
stock
for
his
benefit.
the
whole
idea
was
he
was
supposed
to
sell
it
for
mine.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
one
i
agree
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
isn't
what
happened
here.
the
customer
didn't
call
up
and
say
sell.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
broker
has
authority
to
sell
but
he
has
authority
to
sell
in
the
interest
of
the
client.
and
no
interest
of
the
client
called
for
the
sale
of
these
securities.
the
only
thing
that
called
for
the
sale
of
the
securities
was
without
selling
them,
i
can't
get
the
money
to
steal.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
there's
no
evidence
that
the
sale
was
made
for
the
fraud.
but
if
as
the
government
says,
some
of
these
sales
were
made
to
cover
a
check
written
on
the
account,
the
sale
would
not
have
occurred
had
the
check
not
been
written.
and
that
check
he
wrote
to
himself
or
to
one
of
these
contract
accounts.
doesn't
that
make
it
automatic
that
the
sale
occurred
in
order
get
the
money
to
pay
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
the
writing
of
the
check
what
caused
the
sale?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
authorized?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
goldblatt,
before
you
sit
down,
would
you
say
something
about
the
fact
that
you
have
adjudications
by
the
sec
that
adopt
the
theory
that
they
are
arguing
before
us,
why
shouldn't
we
defer
if
the
question
is
a
close
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
these
are
formal
adjudications
under
the
administrative
procedures
act
and
they
have
ruled
in
accordance
with
the
theory
that
the
government
is
now
arguing.
why
isn't
that
entitled
to
deference?
justice
antonin
scalia
go
ahead.
i
have
a
different
subject.
finish
this
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
we
have
apparently
some,
i
would
call
it
a
factual
disagreement,
as
to
whether
any
adjudications
by
the
sec
adopt
the
theory
that
you
are
arguing
before
us
today.
what
are
your
best
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
do
you
say
rule...
or
section
10(b)
is
violated?
let's
assume
that
this
scheme
is
discovered
before
he
actually
runs
off
with
the
money.
he
sold
the
stocks
in
order
to
run
off
with
the
proceeds,
but
you
get
him
before
he
runs
off
with
the
proceeds.
has
there
been
a
violation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--at
the
time
of
the
sale?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that's
logical
and
that
sort
of
makes
me
worry
about...
about
the
great
scope
of
litigation
that
we
are
inviting
if
you
say
civil
actions
not
by
the
commission
but
by
individuals
are
also
available
under
this
theory.
whenever
a
broker
sells
stock,
he's
always
open
to
the
charge
that
he
wasn't
doing
it
in
my
interest,
he
was
doing
it
in
his
own,
and
you
have
a
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
stock's
gone
up.
i
mean,
the
stock
that
has
been
sold
has
gone
up
enormously.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
all
the
plaintiff
has
to
allege
is
you
really
didn't
sell
it
in
my
interest,
you
sold
it
because
you
were
going
to
run
off
with
the
proceeds,
and
look
what
happened,
the
stock
went
way
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
want
to
argue
that
distinction,
mr.
roberts?
justice
antonin
scalia
too
true.
[laughter]
