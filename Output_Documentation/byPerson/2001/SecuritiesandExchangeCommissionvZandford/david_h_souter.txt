so
in
this
case
the
fraud
could
have
been
avoided
under
your
theory
if
the
broker
had
gotten
in
touch
with
the
clients
and
said
i'm
going
to
sell
this
but
i'm
going
to
use
the
money
for
myself.
that
would
have
turned
it
from
fraud
under
10(b)
into
theft.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
wouldn't
have
been
fraud.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
your
paradigm,
you
are
saying
the
authorization
is
induced
by
fraud
and
that's
crucial.
but
in...
why
don't
you
have
the
equivalent
of
it
here?
because
what
you
have
here
is
a
continuing
authorization.
there
is
an
authorization
generally
given
at
the
beginning
and
the
theory
is
that
that
authorization
continues
so
that
at
every
moment
subsequent
to
that
the
client
is
saying
yes,
you
may
sell
these
things
or
buy
as
you
see
fit
for
my
benefit,
so
that
at
any
moment
at
which
the
client
remains
silent
and
allows
that
authorization
to
continue,
if
at
that
moment
the
broker
has
formed
the
intent,
which
you
would
take
to
be
sufficient,
why
doesn't
that
function
in
the
same
way
as
the
authorization
specifically
induced?
the
client
is
being
quiet
and
he's
continuing
the
authorization
because
the
broker
is
implicitly
lying.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
outside
of
the
authorization
at
the
beginning
because
the
authorization
under
no
circumstances
covered
that
kind
of
a
sale.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
term
of
the
authorization
that
i'm
saying
is
crucial,
and
what
i
thought
you
were
saying
is
crucial
in
the
case
that
you
succeed
is
the
term
of
the
authorization
that
in
effect
says,
you
may
sell
this
stock
for
my
benefit.
and
you
are
saying
if
a
specific
decision
to
that
effect
is
induced
by
fraud,
that's
enough.
it
gets
you
within
the
rule.
and
i'm
saying
if
a
continuing
decision,
a
decision
evidenced
by
the
client's
silence
is
induced,
that
should
be
sufficient
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then
maybe
this
case
should
come
out
your
way.
but
as
a
matter
of
theory,
isn't
it
the
same
case
whether
it's
a
continuing
authorization
or
an
authorization
which
is
specifically
induced?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
missing
something.
why
do
you
write
the
check
first
if
all
you
intend
to
do
is
to
take
the
proceeds
and
buy
another
stock
for
the
client's
benefit?
it's
the
sequence
of
the
check,
i
think,
that's
bothering
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
it
matter
who
the
check
is
written
to?
i
mean,
i
presume
these
checks
that
the
government
was
referring
to
were
not
checks
sort
of
payable
to
the
mutual
fund
to
buy
more
stock
or
payable
for
the
purchase
of
other
stock.
it
was
simply
payable
to
the
broker;
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
they
can't...
you
are
saying
they
can't
trace
any
proceeds
necessarily
from
the
checks
drawn
into
zandford's
personal
accounts
or--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
when
you
say
it
is
consistent
with
the
instruction,
you
are
assuming
the
instruction
simply
means
you
can
buy
or
you
cancel,
whereas
the
argument
is
that
the
instruction
is
you
can
buy
for
my
benefit
or
you
cancel
for
my
benefit.
and
if
we
accept
the
latter
characterization
as
true,
then
even
under
your
own
theory,
he
was
not
making
a
sale
that
he
was
authorized
to
make.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
are
saying
we
can
defer
it,
but
there's
nothing
to
defer
it
to.
