make
any
difference?
the
the
plain
versus
the
harmless?
my
only
problem
is
i
foresee
writing
more
words.

so,
the
o-
we
don't
have
to
talk
about
plain
error
or
harmless
error.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
i-
that's
ex-
you've
got
exactly
what
i'm
concerned
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
bit
repetitive,
but
but
assuming
you're
right
that
they
did
just
import
this
and
didn't
discuss
or
intend
to
change,
what
you
look
to
to
decide
if
there
is
a
harmless
error,
what
about
justice
o'connor's
question?
because
in
the
note,
they
do
say
what
you
should
look
to
is
the
transcript
of
the
colloquy
and
also
the
other
other
what
the
exact
words,
but
you
we
probably
know
the
exact
words
the
oth-
the
the
other
portions
of
the
limited
record
made
in
such
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
from
your
point
of
view,
it
isn't
a
question
of
what
we
should
look
at.
