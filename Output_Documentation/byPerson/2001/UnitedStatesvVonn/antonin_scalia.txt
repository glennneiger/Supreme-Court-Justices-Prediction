alternatively
we
we
could
resolve
it
just
on
the
basis
of
your
third
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
m-
maybe
i
got
your
numbers
wrong,
but
but
but...
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly
resolve
it
on
several
of
the
questions
without
resolving
the
other
ones.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
more
important?
i
mean,
if
if
if
we're
going
to
be
very
parsimonious
and
and
not
decide
any
more
issues
than
we
have
to,
which
which
is
does
the
government
think
is
the
more
important
issue
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
latter
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
an-
any
court,
other
than
this
one,
come
out
this
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
i'm
i
have
a
perplexity.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
but
as
the
rule
reads
if
the
defendant
is
not
represented
by
an
attorney,
that
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
be
represented
by
an
attorney
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding
and,
if
necessary,
one
will
be
appointed
to
represent
the
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
is
applicable
whether
or
not
he's
represented.
justice
antonin
scalia
fair
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
would
would
you
be
taking
the
same
position
regarding
plain
error
review
if
what
were
at
issue
was
c
two
rather
than
c
three?
justice
antonin
scalia
c
two
envisions
a
situation
in
which
there's
nobody
to
make
the
objection.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
c
three,
well,
s-
doesn't
always
envision
a
situation...
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel
is
present,
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
much
of
a
sanction
on
the
judge
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
prophylactic
rule
doesn't
say
what
you
want
us
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
whole
record.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
what
why
wait
what
m-
mccarthy
didn't
require
looking
to
the
record
at
all
for
any
harmless
error.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
underst-
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
government's
not
proposing
to
change
that
that
mccarthy
rule.
