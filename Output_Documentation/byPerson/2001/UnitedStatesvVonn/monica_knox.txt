ms.
monica
knox
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
ms.
monica
knox
well,
the
initial
starting
place
is
what
the
advisory
committee
did.
ms.
monica
knox
well,
it
is
a
substantial
error
in
that
it
is
one
of
the
core
concerns
of
rule
eleven.
ms.
monica
knox
if
the
record,
in
fact,
shows
that
the
defendant
had
the
knowledge
he
needs
to
render
an
intelligent
plea,
i
would
agree
that
that
would
be
harmless
error.
ms.
monica
knox
specifically
there
is
nothing...
ms.
monica
knox
eleven
that
says
you
cannot
do
that.
ms.
monica
knox
no.
ms.
monica
knox
the
record
does
not
show
how
many
defendants
were
being
arraigned
in
this
case,
no.
ms.
monica
knox
yes.
ms.
monica
knox
that's
right,
and
we
also
have
a
client
who
repeatedly
told
the
court
that
he
wasn't
understanding
what
his
attorney
was
telling
him.
ms.
monica
knox
well,
i
think
it
means
in
many
cases
it
may
not
be
easy
to
decide.
ms.
monica
knox
well,
that
is
always
one
of
the
advantage
of
prophylactic
rules
is
to
prevent
that
later...
ms.
monica
knox
of
fact
finding.
ms.
monica
knox
there
was
no
reason,
in
nineteen
seventy-four
when
the
advisory
committee
added
g
to
the
rule,
to
say
that...
ms.
monica
knox
it
was
the
rule
of
mccarthy.
ms.
monica
knox
no,
but
mccarthy
wha-
determined
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
rule
eleven
error
by
looking
only
at
the
rule
eleven
colloquy.
ms.
monica
knox
those
have
to
be
established...
ms.
monica
knox
on
the
record...
ms.
monica
knox
time.
ms.
monica
knox
other
than
the
policy
reason
that
we've
discussed,
as
well
as
what
m-
my
argument
as
to
what
the
advisory
committee
meant
when
it
put
both
g
and
h
into
the
rule,
i
don't
have
another
reason
that
the
court
should
do
it.
ms.
monica
knox
i
think
it
contemplated
looking
at
the
transcript
with
certain
rule
eleven
violations.
ms.
monica
knox
i
think
the
court
itself
recognized
in
hyde
that
all
provisions
of
the
rules
are
not...
ms.
monica
knox
both
the
prov-
c
and
d
start
out
with
language
that
says,
a
court
may
not
accept
a
plea
unless.
ms.
monica
knox
that's
true.
ms.
monica
knox
well,
at
the
time
that
rul-
that
h
was
added
into
rule
eleven,
the
provisions
of
c
one,
two,
and
three
m-
w-
excuse
me
c
one,
two,
three,
and
four
did
not
include
the
provisions
about
restitution.
ms.
monica
knox
hyde.
ms.
monica
knox
yes.
ms.
monica
knox
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
there
is
a
basis
for
distinguishing
some
of
the
rule
eleven
violations
from
other
rule
eleven
violations,
that
they
do
not
all
stand
on
equal
footing.
ms.
monica
knox
and
i
was
only
pointing
out...
ms.
monica
knox
the...
ms.
monica
knox
committee
notes
that
went...
ms.
monica
knox
the
committee
notes...
ms.
monica
knox
that...
ms.
monica
knox
no.
ms.
monica
knox
i
first,
that
we
should
back
up
to
the
year
before
h
was
added
in.
ms.
monica
knox
they
well,
d-
n-
no.
ms.
monica
knox
and
it
makes
perfect
sense
that
the
committee
would
do
that.
ms.
monica
knox
i
can
only
answer
what
i
answered
to
justice
o'connor,
which
is
that
they
were
referring
to
the
more
technical
aspects
of
rule
eleven
and
not
the
core
requirements.
ms.
monica
knox
well,
both
of
those.
ms.
monica
knox
no,
i'm
not
actually
advocating
an
automatic
reversal
rule.
ms.
monica
knox
in
order
to
determine
whether
a
plea
is
intelligent,
it
turns
on
what
knowledge
the
defendant
has.
ms.
monica
knox
for
example,
when
the
court
gives
him
his
right
about
confronting
and
cross
examining
witnesses,
it
could
be
given
to
him
in
the
context
of
his
attorney
doing
it.
ms.
monica
knox
absolutely
not.
ms.
monica
knox
because
in
this
record
we
have
two
proceedings
that
occurred
months
before
the
taking
of
mr.
vonn's
pleas.
ms.
monica
knox
well,
it's
in
the...
ms.
monica
knox
it
is
in
the
record
that
it
was
scheduled
for
trial.
ms.
monica
knox
no.
ms.
monica
knox
no.
ms.
monica
knox
they
th-
it
is
true
that
the
kni-
the
gun
use
allegation
had
been
set
for
trial.
