justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
place
any
reliance
on
the
amendment
to
the
rule
in
nineteen
eighty-three
to
add
subsection
h,
which
says
any
variance
from
the
procedures
required
by
this
rule,
meaning
rule
eleven,
which
does
not
affect
substantial
rights,
shall
be
disregarded.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
this
in
this
case,
if
we
do
look
to
the
entire
record
and
if
we
do
learn
that
this
defendant
was
advised
that
he
had
a
right
to
an
attorney
if
he
went
to
trial
at
the
trial
and
had
acknowledged
that
understanding,
then
why
is
it
not
oh
one
of
these
insubstantial
errors
contemplated
by
subsection
h?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
shows
that
the
defendant,
in
fact,
knew,
what's
the
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
rule
eleven
itself
that
says
you
cannot
look
beyond
the
transcript
of
the
plea
hearing
itself?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
i
read
the
advisory
committee
notes
when
they
added
subsection
h,
i
thought
the
note
stated
that
harmless
error
review
should
be
resolved
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
rule
eleven
transcript
and
the
other
portions
of
the
limited
record
made
in
such
cases.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
he
originally
entered
a
plea
to
one
charge,
but
he
was
going
to
go
on
to
trial
on
the
other.
