mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
respondent
pleaded
guilty
with
counsel
by
his
side
after
having
been
advised
at
least
twice
earlier
in
the
proceedings
of
his
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
all
stages
of
the
proceedings.
the
court
of
appeals,
nevertheless,
set
aside
his
guilty
plea
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court,
during
the
guilty
plea
colloquy,
had
failed
to
advise
respondent
of
his
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
as
required
by
rule
eleven
c
three
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
wrong
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
by
applying
a
harmless
error
rather
than
a
plain
error
standard
of
review
to
the
district
court's
violation
of
rule
eleven.
respondent
had
not
objected
in
the
trial
court
to
the
rule
eleven
error,
and
therefore
the
standard
of
review
is
that
for
claims
which
were
not
preserved
below,
rather
than
claims
that
were.
second,
the
ninth
circuit
applied
an
incorrect
standard
for
determining
whether
a
rule
eleven
error
affects
substantial
rights
within
the
meaning
of
the
harmless
error
and
plain
error
rules.
the
ninth
circuit
was
of
the
view
that
unless
the
defendant
could
be
shown
to
have
knowledge
of
the
precise
aspect
of
rule
eleven,
that
the
district
court
had
failed
to
inform
the
defendant
about
the
guilty
plea
must
be
set
aside.
the
correct
standard
under
this
court's
cases
is
whether
the
error
had
an
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
proceeding,
which
in
this
case
means
whether
the
error
had
an
effect
on
respondent's
willingness
to
enter
a
knowing
and
voluntary
guilty
plea.
and
finally,
the
ninth
circuit
erred
by
confining
its
analysis
of
whether
the
error
in
this
case
warranted
reversal
to
the
record
of
the
guilty
plea
colloquy
itself,
failing
to
look
at
other
portions
of
the
official
record
that
illuminated
whether
the
defendant
actually
had
knowledge
of
the
information
that
the
district
judge
had
failed
to
provide
to
him.
in
this
case,
the
district
court,
through
its
magistrate
judges,
had
advised
respondent,
both
at
the
initial
appearance
after
respondent
was
arrested
and
at
the
arraignment
after
respondent
was
indicted,
of
his
right
to
counsel
at
all
stages
of
the
proceeding.
respondent
executed
a
waiver
of
rights
form
in
which
he
acknowledged
receiving
and
understanding
these
rights,
and
the
district
magistrate
judge
asked
respondent
at
the
arraignment
whether
he
understood
these
rights.
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
looked
to
the
entire
record
to
determine
whether
the
rule
eleven
error
in
this
case
warranted
reversal,
it
would
have
concluded,
even
under
its
own
standards,
applying
harmless
error
review
and
asking
whether
the
respondent
knew
the
information
that
he
had
not
been
told
during
the
rule
eleven
colloquy,
that
respondent,
indeed,
did
have
that
information
and,
therefore,
entered
a
valid
guilty
plea.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
ou-
our
second
argument
is
that
the
proper
inquiry
into
whether
an
error
affects
substantial
rights
is
whether
there
is
an
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
is
it's
a
difficult
inquiry
to
make
if
there
is
no
information
in
the
record
that
sheds
light
on
it,
and
in
that
instance,
the
party
that
bears
the
burden
of
proof
will
probably
lose,
which
is
why
it
matters
whether
the
standard
is
plain
error
review,
in
which
the
defendant
bears
the
burden
of
proof,
or
harmless
error
review,
in
which
case
the
government
bears
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
the
court
can
reverse
the
judgment
based
solely
on
a
favorable
resolution
for
the
government
of
the
third
question
presented
that
is,
if
the
court
does
look
to
the
entire
record
in
this
case,
then
i
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
is
incorrect
even
if
it
were
correct
on
the
other
two
points
that
i've
outlined.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
true,
and
the
court
could
resolve
the
case
solely
on
that
basis.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
would
be
resolution
on
what
i
think
is
the
first
question
that
we
present
in
the...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
certainly
possible
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
two
that
we
presented
i
think
are
both
equally
important.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
is
a
conflict
on
the
latter
as
well.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
government
doesn't
ask
the
c-
the
court
to
a-
write
new
words.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there
are
two
competing
definitions
that
are
proposed
for
the
court
on
what
an
effect
on
substantial
rights
is.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
question
suggested
that
there
may
be
some...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
i
certainly
agree
and
i
agreed
with
other
questions
that
suggest
that
there
is
a
very
straightforward,
simple
resolution
of
this
case
that
would
involve
making
very
little
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
court
of
appeals
should
affirm
because
there
is
ample
evidence
that
the
defendant
had
knowledge
of
the
particular
right
in
question
that
he
claims
was
not
given
to
him
at
the
rule...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
record,
then
i
think
that
there's
nothing
to
rebut
the
presumption.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
said
that
the
first
time
that
he
wanted
to
enter
a
guilty
plea
and
the
district
judge
recessed
the
proceedings
for
a
week
to
give
the
lawyer
an
additional
chance
to
explain
to
the
defendant
what
was
going
on.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
clearly
violated
the
rule
because
rule
eleven
is
a
prophylactic
rule
that
sweeps
more
broadly
than
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
necessary
consequence
of
a
ruling
in
our
favor,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is
applicable
if
the
court
concludes
that
plain
error
review
does
not
apply.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
souter,
i
s-
believe
that
the
reason
that
the
drafters
picked
just
one
is
the
drafters
were
addressing
a
specific
holding
of
this
court
that,
as
justice
o'connor
indicated,
had
suggested
that
there
was
automatic
reversal
in
the
case
of
a
rule
eleven
violation.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
drafters
weren't
thinking
of
this
issue.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
you
could.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
and
rule
fifty-two
is
also
addressed
to
the
district
court.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
rule
eleven
c
two.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
this
case
was
of
rule
eleven
c
three,
which
enumerates
for
the
defendant
the
various
rights,
not
a
complete
list,
but
a
partial
list
of
rights
that
the
defendant
has
at
the
trial.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
that
rule
is
a
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
boykin
versus
alabama
which
held
that
if
the
record
is
entirely
silent
on
whether
the
defendant
entered
a
knowing
and
intelligent
plea,
a
court
of
appeals
on
direct
review
cannot
uphold
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
but
it
would
be
an
almost
impossible
burden...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
actually
i
want
to
re-
revise
the
answer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
it
would
be
very
hard
for
us
to
win
if
the
advice
required
under
c
two
were
not
given
and
the
defendant
were
not
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
not
because
only
counsel
can
make
an
objection.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
court
should
frame
a
rule
to
provide
a
sanction.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
ultimate
sanction...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
on
society
if...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
stevens,
because
whoever
bore
the
bu-
burden
of
proof
on
appeal
is
going
to
have
to
make
that
showing
based
on
the
existing
record,
and
if
the
government
bears
the
burden
and
it
can't
establish
harmlessness,
then
the
court
of
appeals
should
vacate
the
plea.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
wouldn't
say
never
and
i
wouldn't
exclude
the
possibility
that
a
district
court
that
a
court
of
appeals
had
discretion,
but
it
sh-
it's
not
the
normal
procedure.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
with
sixty
thousand
federal
criminal
convictions
each
year,
even
a
very
low
error
rate
is
going
to
produce
a
large
number
of
cases
and
there
are
a
large
number
of
rule
eleven
cases
that
come
to
the
court
of
appeals
where
there
really
is
no
substantial
doubt
that
the
defendant
had
all
the
information
and
counsel
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
this
is
a
minor
deviation,
justice
stevens,
because
this
defendant
had
been
told
about...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
counsel.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
virtually
inevitable
that
it
will
be.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
he
he
should
know
that,
and
rule
eleven
should
be
complied
with,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
court
of
appeals
case
that
reverses
a
conviction
for
failure
to
give
this
advice
to
a
counseled
defendant.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
unless
the
court
has
any
short
questions
the
government
will
submit.
