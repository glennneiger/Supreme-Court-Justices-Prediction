ask
you
a
question
there?
you
pointed
out
i
guess
it's
no
question
that
subsection
h
was
added,
in
effect,
to
negate
the
the
automatic
reversal
rule
that
that
had
prevailed
beforehand.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
cleanest
way
to
negate
it
would
be
to
simply
say,
you
engage
in
some
kind
of
an
analysis
of
consequences.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
could
you
could
certainly
accept
the
position
that
that
there
would
not
be
a
per
se
reversal
under
another
rule
without
also
accepting
the
position
that
fifty-two
b
would
still
apply.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
can't
we
can't
start
i
don't
think,
we
can
start
making
distinctions
within
the
the
the
rule
eleven
list
among
the
rights
that
are
supposed
to
be
advised.
justice
david
h.
souter
to
the
question
of
of
what
would
will
happen,
if
we
get
to
that
point,
on
on
remand
for
consideration
of
a
broader
record
if
we
rule
against
you
on
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
is
your
b-
is
your
your
basic
point
is
that
congress
intended
just
to
streamline
these
proceedings
and
it
simply
didn't
want
courts
have
to
have
to
get
into
difficult
evidentiary
issues
and
that's
why
we
should
hold
that
they
look
no
further
than
the
four
corners?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words
you're
argument
is
that
the
that
they
have
shown
and
i
take
it
they
have
shown
in
this
litany
of
examples
that
you
referred
to
a
moment
ago
a
series
of
situations
that
they
wanted
to
address.
justice
david
h.
souter
your
factual...
justice
david
h.
souter
on
the
record
to
the
effect
that
his
defense
counsel
had
said
to
him,
by
the
way,
if
we
go
to
trial,
i'm
out
of
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david

souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
rule
11
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
aims
to
assure
that
defendants
who
plead
guilty
do
so
knowingly
and
voluntarily.
it
does
this
by
compelling
judges
to
advice
defendants
of
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
them
and
the
rights
they
will
give
up
by
not
going
to
trial.
this
advice
is
known
as
rule
11
colloquially
and
it
occurs
at
the
hearing
when
a
defendant
pleads
guilty.
rule
11
is
unique
among
the
federal
rules
in
containing
its
own
review
provisions
subsection
h,
which
provides
that
any
error
under
the
rule
that
the
government
can
show
did
not
prejudiced
the
defendant
will
not
affect
the
validity
of
the
plea.
subsection
(h)
closely
tracks
the
language
of
rule
52(a),
the
rule’s
general
harmless-error
provision
but
unlike
the
general
rule
52,
subsection
(h)
is
not
accompanied
by
a
plain
error
provision
giving
defendants
who
do
not
make
a
timely
objection
and
opportunity
to
have
the
error
corrected
if
they
can
carry
the
converse
burden
of
showing
that
the
error
did
not
prejudiced
them.
in
1977,
the
respondent,
alphonso
vonn
pleaded
guilty
to
three
charges
arising
out
of
a
bank
robbery.
at
two
separate
plea
hearings,
the
district
judge
adviced
him
of
the
rights
he
would
relinquish
by
foregoing
a
trial
but
the
judge
felt
just
short
of
what
rule
11
requires
where
he
failed
to
tell
vonn
that
if
he
proceeded
to
trial,
he
will
have
the
right
to
counsel
at
the
trial.
on
appeal
vonn
argued
for
the
first
time
that
his
guilty
pleas
on
all
three
counts
were
invalid
because
the
judge
skipped
this
one
item
at
advice.
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
holding
that
under
rule
11,
the
government
bears
the
burden
of
showing
that
rule
11
error
to
the
harmless
whether
or
on
not
the
defendant
or
his
lawyer
brought
that
error
to
the
attention
of
the
district
judge
in
the
first
place.
because
the
government
could
not
satisfy
this
burden
without
making
reference
to,
we
advice
that
vonn
received
in
proceedings
separate
from
the
rule
11
colloquies.
the
ninth
circuit
vacated
his
guilty
pleas.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
vacate
and
remand.
we
hold
two
things:
first,
that
a
defendant
who
lets
rule
11
error
passed
without
objection
in
the
trial
court
must
bear
the
burden
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
showing
prejudice;
and
second,
that
the
revealing
court
must
look
to
the
entire
trial
record
to
make
this
finding
not
just
the
record
of
the
rule
11
colloquie.
we
reject
vonn’s
argument
that
congress’
explicit
command
in
rule
11(h)
that
harmless-error
is
to
be
disregarded.
it
was
meant
to
eliminate
a
defendant’s
burden
under
the
rule
52(b)
plain
error
provision.
although
it
is
a
familiar
count
on
the
statutory
interpretation
that
the
expression
of
one
item
in
a
group
of
commonly
associated
items
excludes
all
the
others,
what
evidence
of
congressional
intent
there
is,
here
it
shows
that
congress
did
not
intend
so
settle
a
message.
rather
in
enacting
rule
11(h),
congress
simply
sought
to
fall
a
trend
that
took
hold
among
courts
of
appeals
following
this
court’s
decision
in
the
case
called
mccarthy
v.
united
states,
that
no
rule
11
slip
up
no
matter
how
minor
could
ever
be
harmless-error.
rule
11(h)
says
it
can
be
harmless-error.
the
rule
that
vonn
proposes
that
the
government
always
has
the
burden
of
showing
harmlessness,
whether
or
not
that
error
was
first
brought
to
the
district
judge's
attention,
undercuts
congress’
goal
evident
elsewhere
in
the
federal
rules
that
defendants
raise
any
objections
to
their
pleas
before
sentencing
and
not
afterward.
finally,
we
find
no
support
for
the
ninth
circuit’s
rule
that
a
reviewing
court
must
ignore
evidence
already
on
the
record
but
outside
the
four
corners
of
the
plea
hearing.
when
the
evidence
shows
that
a
defendant
was
not
actually
harmed
by
the
judge’s
failure
to
comply
fully
with
rule
11.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
