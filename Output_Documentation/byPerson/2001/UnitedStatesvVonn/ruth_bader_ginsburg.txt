mr.
dreeben?
i'm
not
sure
how...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
if
we
answer
what
is
your
second
question
in
your
petition,
not
as
outlined
this
morning,
the
second
question
being,
do
you
look
to
the
entire
record
or
just
the
rule
eleven
colloquy,
if
we
answer
that
question
in
your
favor,
look
to
the
entire
record,
is
it
necessary
to
get
into
the
two
anterior
questions
that
you
outline,
that
is
plain
error
versus
harmless
error,
and
then
this
one
that
troubled
justice
kennedy
that
you
don't
list
as
a
question
in
your
cert
petition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
if
that
is
an
academic
question,
that
is,
if
you
could
argue,
as
i
think
you
do,
if
you
look
at
the
whole
record,
then
it
doesn't
matter
what
standard
you
apply,
harmless
error,
plain
error.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
this
record
where
the
defendant
said
a
couple
times
i
don't
understand
what
this
lawyer
is
talking
about
a-
and
this
is
my
first
time
in
in
the
criminal
process?
b-
i-
he
was,
as
you
said,
told
twice
and
signed
a
piece
of
paper
that
said
counsel
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding,
but
the
defendant
also
said
that
he
didn't
s-
he
didn't
understand
what
was
going
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
eleven
h
is
addressed
to
the
district
court
too,
and
the
plai-
you're
talking
about
what
should
the
standard
be
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question?
that
is,
taking
your
position,
there
is
really
no
muscle
behind
the
instruction
to
the
district
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
pre-
p-
two
pre-guilty
plea,
the
arraignment
and
when
the
initial
complaint
was
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
and
at
the
arraignment
at
least
at
that
stage,
a
lawyer
had
already
been
appointed,
and
wasn't
it
true
that
the
lawyer
was
with
the
client
at
the
arraignment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that,
in
addition
to
the
oral
warning
in
the
courtroom,
there
was
a
document
that
had
a
rather
simple
paragraph,
unusually
plain
english
for
for
lawyers
and
judges.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
i'm
looking...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
the
notes,
the
advisory
committee
notes,
on
the
addition
of
h,
and
what
particular
part
do
you
say
makes
it
clear
that...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
essentially
asking
us
to
restore
the
automatic
reversal
rule
with
respect
to
this
piece
of
advice
that
is,
if
you
plead
guilty,
you
give
up
your
right
to
counsel
at
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
something?
