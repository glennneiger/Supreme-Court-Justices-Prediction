justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me...
i'm
having
trouble
following
your
argument.
and
one
reason
is
because
i
am
using
the
words
differently
than
apparently
you
are.
i
understand
we
are
in
a
universe
where
you
are
only
going
to
get
paid
under
this
statute
if
you
win.
am
i
right
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
we
all
assume
in
that
sense
every
fee
is
contingent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
i
thought
we
were
trying
to
distinguish
within
that
universe
between
some
circuits
that
say
the
way
we
should
calculate
that
is
by
looking
to
what
they
call
the
lodestar,
and
other
circuits
that
say
the
way
we
calculate
it
is
we
look
to
the
agreement
and
if
the
agreement
is
for
25
percent
of
the
recovery,
that's
where
we
start.
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now
what
is
it
that
we
are
trying
to
decide?
are
we
trying
to
decide
whether...
what
is
it
that
you
see
us
trying
to
decide
within
that
universe?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
as
far
as
i
can
see,
the
ninth
circuit
says
we
start
with
the
lodestar,
but
then
it
can
be
adjusted
for
12
factors.
number
six
of
which
is
what
i
would
call
the
contingent
fee,
namely,
the
one
25
percent
of
the
judgment
written
into
the
contract
which
is
what
i
will
use
the
word
contingent
to
refer
to,
and
so
you
have
the
ninth
circuit
says
first
the
lodestar
adjusted
for
that,
and
then
some
other
circuits
say
first
start
with
25
percent
contingency,
but
adjust
it
if
that
isn't
reasonable.
now,
that's
how
i
was
seeing
it.
now,
am
i
right?
correct
me
if
i'm
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
are
some
variations,
but
those
are
the
two
basic
things.
all
right.
as
between
those
two
basic
things,
what
is
it
you
want
us
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
you
said
circuits
start
with
the
25
percent
contract
and
adjust,
rather
than
the
circuits
that
say
start
with
the
lodestar
and
adjust.
and
the
statute
says
may.
and
now
why
should
we
do
what
you
want
rather
than
letting
the
ninth
circuit
free
to
do
it
the
way
it
wants?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
not
a
subsidy.
what's
a
subsidy?
i
mean
the
obvious,
everybody
has
the
same
point.
if
you
say
they
can
only
learn
$40
an
hour,
the
social
security
people
won't
be
represented
or
they
will
pad
their
hours.
now,
i
can't
believe
congress
wanted
that.
so,
so
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
an
answer
to
that,
and
congress
used
the
word
may,
so
may
means
may.
i
mean,
that's
the
simple
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
sounds
to
me
so
far
there
is
no
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
available,
why
wouldn't
we
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
asked.
what
do
you
mean
shifting
of
benefits?
it's
not
a...
a
subsidy
is
where
you
take
some
money
and
you
pay
for
somebody
to
do
something.
i
don't
see
why
you
call
this
a
subsidy.
that's
a
conclusion.
what
they
are
doing
here
is
they
are
charging
what
it
costs
them
to
provide
service
to
smith,
and
it
is
what
it
costs
because
in
the
absence
of
this,
smith
won't
get
the
service.
nor
will
jones
and
brown,
they
are
apt
to
lose.
but
particularly
smith
won't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
way
to
word
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
well,
why
shouldn't
we
look
at
it
that
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
should
we
look
at
it
that
way
since
smith
is
also
paying
for
what
it
costs
to
serve
smith?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
wondering
if
you
had
spent
a
lot
of
time--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
that's
so
then
the
judge
in
all
the
circuits
that
follow
the
contingent
method
would
reduce
the
award.
i
mean,
in
one
way
you
are
going
to
start
with
the
lodestar
enhance.
in
the
other
way
you
are
going
to
start
with
the
contingent
fee
reduce
it.
i
guess
the
simpler
is
the
contingent
fee
reduce
it.
i
think
frankly
you
don't
have
to
go
into
the
hours.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
any
sort
of
egregious
examples
where
there
was
a
lot
of
delay
in
those
circuits
just
to
build
up
the
recovery?
has
that
turned
out
to
be
a
problem
for
the
agency
anywhere?
