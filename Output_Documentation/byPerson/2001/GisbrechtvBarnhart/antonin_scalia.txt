justice

scalia
mr.
schnaufer,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
as
i
understand
it,
406(a)
provides
that
for
representation
before
the
agency,
the
agency
shall
prescribe
a
maximum
fee.
is...
is...
am
i
correct
in
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
agency
sets
a
fee
and
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
parties
have
agreed
to
before
the
agency.
they
can
agree
to
whatever
they
like.
the
agency
says
this
is
the
maximum
fee.
why
would
congress
in
b
adopt
a
totally
different
regime
for
representation
before
the
courts?
as
a,
you
know,
before
the
agency,
your
agreement
with
your
lawyer
doesn't
make
any
difference,
but
before
the
courts
basically
what
governs
is
your
agreement
with
the
lawyer.
i
don't
know
why
they
would
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
requires
them
to
ignore
it
if
it
goes
beyond
what
the
agency
determines
is
the
maximum
amount
that
ought
to
be
charged.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
schnaufer,
here's
my
problem
with,
with
your
basic
argument,
which
is
look
at
the
parties
who
negotiated
a
fee
in
another
context,
that
negotiated
fees
with
what
the
court
begins
with.
this
is
not
other
contexts.
all
three
of
the
contracts
involved
in
this
case
provided
for
a
fee
of
25
percent
of
the
back
benefits,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
is
testimony
in
this
case
that
that
is
the
universal
practice,
the
universal
practice
of
all
the
lawyers
that
represent
these
kind
of,
these
kinds
of
clients.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that,
that
25
percent
of
back
benefits
is
the
maximum
allowed
by
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what,
what
reason
is
there
to
believe
that
this
is
a,
you
know,
an
honest
evaluation
by
the
two
parties
of
what
the,
of
what
the
lawyers'
services
are
worth?
the
lawyers
are
simply
going
for
the
absolute
maximum
that
the
laws
allow.
i
don't
know
why
we
should
"approach
this"
or
why
congress
would
have
approached
it
as
cases
in
which
well,
you
know,
after
all,
the
parties
struck
a
deal
at
the
beginning
at
arm's
length
and
that
should
be
the
starting
point.
this
is
not
that
kind
of
a
situation.
it
is
a
closed
market
in
which
these,
these
plaintiffs
take
what
the
bar
gives
them.
that's
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
sometimes
it
would
be
a
larger
part
of
the
benefit.
it
depends
entirely
on
how
long
the
case
goes
on.
it's
entirely
fluky,
and
in
all
of
the
cases,
the
lawyers
come
in
and
say
25
percent.
that's
the
max
i
can
get,
and
that's
what
i'm
going
to
ask
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
smith
is
paying,
smith
is
paying
for
the
work
done
for
the
two
guys
who
lost.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
that,
did
that
prohibition
of
contingency
enhancements
apply
in
the
context
such
as
this
where
it
was
only
legally
possible
to
charge
when
you
win?
justice
antonin
scalia
might
not
that
make
a
difference?
it's
one
thing
to
say
well,
if
you
don't,
if
you
don't
charge
anything
for
your
losing
cases,
that's
your
problem.
you
ought
to
charge.
and
we
are
not
going
to
allow
you
to
conduct
that
practice
and
make,
make
this
plaintiff
pay
for
the,
for
the
two
who
you
lost.
but
when
you
are
in
a
different
context
where
the
only
time
you
can
get
fees
by
law
is
where
you
win,
would
we
have
to
pay,
would
we
have
to
adopt
the
same
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
maximum
wouldn't
make
any
sense
otherwise.
i
mean,
the
maximum
is
25
percent
of
the
back
pay
award.
if
there
is
no
back
pay
award,
you
can
charge
as
much
as
you
like.
i
mean,
that's
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
the
point
were
you
driving
at.
so
what,
so
they
tripled
in
10
years,
you
know,
and
the
ice
cap
melted.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
were
driving
at.
what
was
the
point
that
you
were
making?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
the
result
of
those,
of
those
jurisdictions
that
have
allowed
contingency
to
be
considered?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
flooded
in
the
other
jurisdictions?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
position
is
that
we
do
not
want
to
subsidize
bad
suits?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
in
the
best
interests
of
anybody,
the
country
or
anybody
else,
to
encourage
lawyers
to
bring
bad
suits
and
then
get
paid
for
it
when
they
win
a
good
suit,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
is
certainly
a
way
to
get
lawyers
in
the
good
suits.
