justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
ask
you
a
question
i
have
been
trying
to
get
in
for
a
while
here.
what
would
you,
what
would
your
reaction
be
to
a
rule
that
says
the
district
judges
shall
require
the
applicant
for
a
fee
to
one,
file
any
contract
he
has,
two,
file
a
statement
of
his
hours,
three,
file
his
normal
rate
that
he
normally
charges
and
based
on
the
district
judge's
knowledge
of
the
proceedings,
he
shall
set
a
reasonable
fee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
you're
saying
in
that
view
is
that
the
equal
access
to
justice
fee
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
lawyer,
rather
than
the
client.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
in
a
way
what
you
mean
by
the
lodestar
method.
i
know
we
have
talked
about
it
in
a
lot
of
cases,
but
would
it
be
a
satisfactory
compliance
with
the
lodestar
method
in
your
view
of
the
case
if
every
judge
said
to
every
lawyer,
file
your
time
sheet
with
me,
i
want
to
know
your
hours,
i
want
to
know
your
regular
charge,
and
i
want
to
see
the
contract
you
have
got,
and
i
know
a
lot
about
the
case,
i'll
fix
the
fee.
would
that
satisfy
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
guidance
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
should
take
into
account
the
hours,
the
general
charge
that
he
makes
and
the
success
in
the
case
and
whatever
contract
he
has
made
and
then
you
would
know
the
case,
you
decide
the
reasonable
fee.
and
we
don't
want
to
have
a
10-month
argument
under
lodestar
method
about
what
the,
you
know,
one
of
the
things
we
want
to
avoid
is
protracted
litigation
in
these
cases,
so
we
want
to
simplify
it.
i
think
you
would
agree
that's
desirable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
just
wondering
if
what
i
propose
to
be
a
sufficient
compliance
with
the
lodestar
method
to
satisfy
the
government?
