well,
it
will
be--
justice
david

why
should
we
consider
the
separate
fee
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act?
a
reasonable
fee
is
a
reasonable
fee.
why
does
it
matter
that
some
money
may
be
forthcoming
from
a
different
source
to
pay
for
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
says
that
they
should
pay
a
reasonable
amount.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
salmons,
another
question
of
statistics.
we
have
had
the
statistic
that
only
one
out
of
three
cases
is
successful.
and
i
take
it
you
have
not
challenged
that.
that's
one
of
the
arguments
that
there
is
something
that
is
really
outrageous
practice
going
on
and
there
is
a
need
to
enhance
for
that
contingency.
what
i
want
to
ask
is
are
there
any,
is
there
any
evidence,
statistical
or
otherwise,
to
explain
why
the
rate
is
only
one
win
out
of
three
cases?
one
reason
might
be
that,
or
one
description
might
be
that
virtually
all
lawyers
who
take
these
cases
in
fact
have
the
experience
of
losing
two
for
every
one.
but
another
explanation
might
be
that
lawyers
who
can
tell
the
difference
between
a
good
case
and
a
bad
case
win
at
a
very
high
rate,
and
that
a
lot
of
young
lawyers
who
don't
have
access
to
many
clients
are
willing
to
take
long
shots
and
that
when
you
average
those
two
together,
you
bet
the
one
win
out
of
three
cases.
do
we
know,
do
we
know
which
possible
description
is
correct
or
whether
there
is
some
third
description
that
explains
the
one
in
three?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
likewise,
i
take
it
there
are
no
statistics
on
how
the
different
compensation
approaches
are
having
an
effect?
