justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
provision
at
the
administrative
level
that
does
refer
to
an
agreement?
this
is,
what
is
it,
(a)(2),
an
agreement--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
controls
with
a
cap
of
$4,000
at
the
agency
level.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask,
just
a
question
of
what
this
fee
is
composed
of.
say
the
claimant
loses
at
all
three
levels
of
the
administrator,
the
administrative
level,
then
wins
in
court.
do
the
hours
before
the
agency
count
and
then
would
they
be
computed
differently
because
the
406(a)--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--after
winning
in
court,
so
they
would
be
completely
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
believe
there
is
another
scheme
i
think
that's
more
adhered
than
this
social
security
scheme.
for
veterans'
benefits
purposes,
you
are
probably
familiar
with
the
provision
that
provides
for
filing
an
agreement
and
then
if
there
is,
when
they
reach
such
an
agreement,
the
total
fee
payable
to
the
attorney
may
not
exceed
20
percent
of
the
total
amount
of
any
past
due
benefits
awarded.
that's
an
express
scheme
for
filing
of
an
agreement
and
the
agreement
enforceable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
are
saying
this
is
a
more...
this
same
statute
came
later,
but
that
essentially,
that
they
operate
the
same
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
place
an
objection
to
the
lodestar
method,
you
said
this
becomes
a
litigation
that
is
embarrassingly
longer
than
the
litigation
over
the
client
itself.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
work
under
the
fee-shifting--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
context
of
a
fee-shifting
statute
where
eaja
applies,
the
lawyer
gets
the
fees
from
the
defendant
under
eaja.
can
the
lawyer
have
an
agreement
with
the
client
that
the
client
is
going
to
pay
an
override
above,
above
what
the
lawyer
gets
from
the
defendant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
all
fees
are
contingent
on
success.
in
other
words,
there
is
some
confusion,
i
think,
of
what
the
term
contingent
fee
means.
nobody
gets
a
fee
if
they
lose.
at
least
the
secretaries
interpreted
the
statute
as
long
as
i
know
to
say
that
the
only
time
that
the
lawyer
is
going
to
recover
is
if
the
plaintiff
guess
benefits,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
and
then
the
question
is
what's,
what
this
provision
requires.
one
just
reaction
that
i
had
to
this
picture
is
well,
in
tort
litigation,
the
standard
is
a
third
of
the
recovery.
and
why
isn't
here,
why
isn't
a
quarter
of
the
recovery
eminently
reasonable
considering
as
was
pointed
out
that
the
recovery
comes
only
out
of
the
past
benefits.
no...
nothing
out
of
the
future
benefits
the
person
is
going
to
get.
so
what
is
it
about
the
25
percent
of
past
benefits?
it
doesn't
just
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense
instead
of
engaging
in
what
we
know
from
this
very
case,
we'll
take
as
much
time
as
the
calculation,
as
the
dispute
over
the
benefits
themselves.
the
litigation
here
over
the
fees
took
as
long
as
the
litigation
over
the
claimant's
right
to
benefits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mentioned
eaja.
one
of
the
problems
that
i
have
with
that
analogy
is
it
works
out
here
that
you
get
eaja
is
just
about
it.
these
three
lawyers
got
what,
what
eaja
permitted.
and
then
fee-shifting
statutes
generally
you
get
from
the
defendant
what
eaja
allows
you,
but
then
you
can
have,
you
can
recover
more
from
your
own
client.
here
it
works
out
that
eaja
is
it
and
it
seems
to
me
something
unfair
about
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
those
were
the
days
you
were
talking
about
50
percent
contingent
fees
so
congress
cut
it
back
to
25,
so
why...
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what...
you
just
said
well,
25
not
in
every
case,
maybe
only
work
two
hours,
it
would
be
unreasonable,
but
instead
of
having
the
judge
and
the
lawyers
go
through
this
whole
thing,
i
mean,
eaja
is
available
only
if
the
government's
position
was
not
substantially
justified,
right?
it's
not
automatic.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
government...
i
don't
know
how
it
works,
but
when
someone
is
seeking
benefits
from
the
government,
government
has
prevailed
all
through
the
agency,
loses
in
court,
does
the
government
just
sort
of
concede
that
the
government's
position
was
not
substantially
justified?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
shouldn't
there
about,
you
say
you
look
at
the
law
of
the
particular
circuit.
i
would
think
that
a
concept
like
was
the
government's
position
substantially
justified
shouldn't
be
whatever
it
means
in,
in
12
different
appellate
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
what
the
rate
is
because
these
are
all
cases
that
lost
at
the
administrative
level,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any,
any
showing
that
maybe
in
the
prior
period,
there
were
more
cases
winning
at
the
administrative
level,
therefore
fewer
getting
into
the
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
is
a
pretty
big
swing
if
you
say
if
the
judge
can
go
up
to
25
percent
if
that's
reasonable,
here
what
was
the
percent,
the
lodestar
percent,
the
lodestar
yielded
what
percent
of
the
past
two
benefits
in
these
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
less,
i
think.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it
was
under
10
percent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
those
were
chopped
down
by
the
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
they
were
not
supposed
to,
at
least
this
court,
the
court
here
did
it.
it
took
out
following
this
court's
precedent
any
override
for
risk
of
nonsuccess.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i'm
not
talking
about
the
rates
that
the
lawyers
asked
for,
i'm
talking
about
the
rates
that
they
got.
my
concern
is
this.
if
you
just
say
well
judge,
look
at
the
agreement.
look
at
the
hourly
rate.
you
can
get
swings
from
one
court
saying
as
i
think
was
true
here,
7.8
percent
to
another
judge
saying
in
that
very
same
case
25
percent.
that's
why
i
think
you
have
to
have
a
little
more
control,
a
little
more
uniformity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
recommending
that
we
say
let
the
judge
do
it,
no
matter
what?
is
that
the
government's
position?
i
thought
the
government
was
coming
in
with
a
pretty
stiff
position
that
it's
the
lodestar
method
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not
make
it
run
the
same
way
the
veterans'
benefits
do?
i
mean,
after
all,
it's
a
similar
kind
of
set
up.
you
claim
that
if
it's
at
the
agency,
you
lose,
you
come
to
court,
and
there
it's
the
agreement
is
20
percent,
so
it's,
but
that
seems
to
be
working
fine,
right?
where
the
judge
gives
the
20
percent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
wasn't
even
established
until
hensley
against...
whatever
it
is.
the
lodestar
got
settled
around
in
the
circuits
in
the
1980s.
social
security
claims
have
been
going
on
a
long
time.
wasn't
it
standard
before,
but
it
was
contingent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
fees
for
lawyer
who
successfully
represent
in
court
clients
seeking
social
security
old
age
survivors
or
disability
benefits.
how
those
fees
should
be
determined
is
the
question
that
has
divided
the
court
of
appeals.
congress
has
provided
that
when
an
applicant
for
social
security
benefits
prevails
in
court,
reasonable
counsel
fees
may
be
awarded
subject
to
two
limitations:
first,
fees
are
payable
only
out
of
benefits
already
past-due
awarded
to
the
claimant;
and
second
the
fee
awards
may
not
exceed
25%
of
the
past-due
benefits.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
sought
social
security
disability
benefits.
they
were
unsuccessful
at
the
administrative
level
but
they
prevailed
in
court.
each
had
signed
a
standard
form
contract
agreeing
to
pay
his
or
her
attorney
25%
of
all
past-due
benefits
recovered.
petitioners,
more
accurately
their
attorneys,
urged
that
the
25%
calculation
should
control
subject
to
downward
adjustment
if
the
resulting
fee
proves
too
large
judge
by
the
size
of
the
benefit
recovered
or
the
quality
of
the
lawyers
representation.
the
social
security
commissioner
on
the
other
hand
urges
counsel
fee
determination
by
the
lodestar
method
that
is
the
method
now
widely
used
on
the
statutes
that
unlike
the
social
security
act
provision
at
issue
shift
the
obligation
to
pay
counsel
from
the
prevailing
party
to
the
losing
party
in
the
litigation.
under
the
lodestar
method
fees
are
determined
by
multiplying
the
hours
the
attorney
reasonably
spent
on
the
case
by
an
hourly
rate
reasonable
for
the
lawyer’s
work.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
whose
judgment
we
review
held
that
the
lodestar
method
governed.
we
reverse
that
judgment
for
reasons
detailed
in
the
court’s
opinion.
we
conclude
that
congress
designed
the
social
security
act's
provision
for
counsel
fees
to
contain
but
not
to
override
the
agreements
between
lawyers
and
social
security
benefits
claimant.
accordingly,
we
hold
that
the
attorney-client
agreement
controls
if
it
yields
a
fee
that
does
not
exceed
25%
of
past-due
benefits
and
is
otherwise
reasonable.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
