chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
number
01-131,
gary
gisbrecht
vs.
jo
anne
barnhart.
spectators
are
admonished,
do
not
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
schnaufer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
the
limits
of
the
extent
of
the
prohibition,
whatever
is
in
406(b).
i
think
that
can
be
read
to
deal
only
with
the
question
where
the
attorney
is
seeking
a
recovery
out
of
the
plaintiff's
recovery.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
anything
more
authoritative
as
the
existing
practice
of
the
bar
that
would
lead
to
that
conclusion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
that's
how
they
get
counsel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wasn't
personal
to
any
statutory
mandate,
was
it?
wasn't
that
that
just
the
supervisory
power
of
the
courts
over
fees?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
got
to
get
back
to
the
statute
and
say
why
the
statute
should
be
read
the
way
you
want
it
to.
this
isn't
an
ordinary
situation
event
or
of
a
contingent
fee
say
in
a
personal
injury
case
which
the
court
may
have
supervision
over
in
the
general
sense.
here
the
court
doesn't
say
that
the
attorney
shall
enter
into
an
agreement
and
the
court
shall
enforce
it.
it
says
the
court
may
determine
and
allow
as
part
of
its
judgment
a
reasonable
fee
for
such
representation.
i
think
you
have
got
to
build
from
that
and
say
why
you
think
that
the
amount
of
the
contingencies
specified
in
your
contract
is
the
one
that
the
court
has
to
follow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
doesn't
say
anything
in
(b)(1)(a)
about
contingent
fees,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
get
a
favorable
judgment--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
can
get
a
fee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
isn't
quite
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district
court
here
relied
on
the
bar
fees
in
the
portland
area,
didn't
it,
for
lawyers
that
have
been
practicing
a
certain
amount
of
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
every
fee
is
in
a
sense
contingent
on
success.
i
mean,
if
you
lose
the
lawsuit,
you
don't
charge
the
same
amount
as
if
you
win
the
lawsuit,
whether
or
not
the
fee
agreement
is
contingent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
district
court
here
expressed,
perhaps
it
was
a
magistrate
judge,
expressed
some
skepticism
as
to
the
number
of
hours,
i
think,
put
in
on
one
of
these
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
fact
the
government
didn't
contest
it
doesn't
mean
that
perhaps
we
shouldn't
pay
some
attention
to
the
view
of
the
district
judge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
schnaufer.
mr.
salmons,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
lodestar
method
take
into
account
the
contingent
nature
of
the
recovery?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i'm
not,
i'm
not
sure
that
fee-shifting
statutes
are
necessarily
an
appropriate
analogy
here
because
perhaps
there
is
no
reason
for
requiring
a
defendant
to
pay
a
lot
of
money
because
of
an
arrangement
between
the
plaintiff
and
his
attorney
was
contingent,
and
the
attorney
doesn't
win
many
cases.
but
i
think
if
you
are
talking
about
an
agreement
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
client
in
the
actual
case,
there
may
be
more
of
a
case
for
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
government's
position,
supposing
one
of
the
social
security
lawyers
has
a
very
wealthy
client
who
feels
he
is
entitled
to
social
security
as
a
course
he
is
just
like
everybody
else.
he
hasn't
been
paid
it,
and
says
to
the
lawyer,
i'll
pay
you
$300
an
hour
if,
for
all
the
work
you
put
on
this
case
because
i
am
determined
to
get
that
social
security.
do
you
think
406(b)
prohibits
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
doesn't
want
to
get
it
out
of
the
judgment
at
all.
he
says
i'll
bill
you
for
it
afterwards.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
the
commission
ever
issued
an
opinion
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
government
have
any
statistics
as
to
how
often
an
award
of
attorneys
fees
by
a
district
judge
is
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
attorney?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
salmons.
mr.
schnaufer,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schnaufer.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
01-131,
gisbrecht
against
barnhart
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
