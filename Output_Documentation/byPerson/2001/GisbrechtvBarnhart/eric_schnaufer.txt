mr.
eric
schnaufer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
asking
this
court
to
recognize
a
simple
principle
that
a
federal
statute
requires
that
an
attorney
fee
be
contingent
on
success
in
litigation,
that
when
the
court
determines
an
attorney
fee
pursuant
to
that
statute,
an
attorney
fee
should
reflect
the
contingent
nature
of
the
fee,
thus
because
406(b)
requires
a
contingent
fee
in
social
security
cases,
when
the
district
court
determined
the
reasonable
fee
pursuant
to
406(b)
that
attorney
fee
must
reflect
the
contingent
nature
of
the
fee.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
possible
to
interpret
the
statute
in
a
way
that
would
not
criminalize
charging
a
claimant
a
noncontingent
fee,
however
the
existing
practice
in
the
bar
is
to
take
it
as
prohibiting
charging
a
noncontingent
fee?
mr.
eric
schnaufer
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
406(b)(2)
where
it
sets
forth
the
criminal
penalties
for
violation
of
the
statute.
there
is
only
one
appellate
court
to
address
whether
or
not
a
noncontingent
fee
may
be
charged
as
the
third
circuit
in
coup,
but
it
doesn't
reach
the
issue.
also
one
district
court
in
hutchinson
cited
in
the
amicus
brief
from
the
claimants
representatives
addresses
that.
no.
i
think
even
if
the
statute
did
not
require
a
contingent
fee
when
there
was
no
judgment
favorable
to
the
plaintiff,
i
believe
that
the
vast
majority
of
claimants
would
voluntarily
choose
to
enter
into
contingent
fee
agreements.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
absolutely.
so
even
if
the
statute
didn't
criminalize
charging
a
noncontingent
fee,
this
would
be
the
voluntary
selection
of
the
vast
majority
of--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--i
believe
this
court's
decision
in
christenberg
garments
is
relevant.
that
case
also
addresses
whether
the
term,
whether
the
court
may
award
attorney
fees
interpreting
that
the
court
did,
the
attorney
matter
wasn't
up
to
the
court,
that
the
court
would
generally
award
the
attorney
fee
in
that
fee
shifting
context.
so
yes,
there
are
situations
in
which
a
different--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--justice
o'connor,
i
believe
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
relative
to
the
legal
context
in
which
it
was
enacted
in
1965,
which
additional
role
of
state
courts
rule
on
contingent
fee
agreements
was
to
decide
where
the
agreed
upon
amount
between
the
parties
was
excessive
or
abusive.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes,
the
federal
courts
in
the
early
'60s,
in
1965,
doubted
whether
they
even
had
the
authority
to
rule
on
the
appropriateness
of
a
contingent
fee.
congress
clarified
that
by
specifically
providing
406(b)
so
the
court,
the
district
court
would
determine
the
reasonableness
of
a
406(b)
fee.
i
believe
that
the--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--that
any
attorney
fee
has
to
be
contingent
on
success
in
the
litigation
that
could
be
different
fee
agreements.
for
example,
a
plaintiff
may
agree
to
charge
or
to
pay
his
or
her
attorney
a
flat
fee
contingent
on
success
in
litigation
or
a
specific
hourly
fee
contingent
on
success
in
the
litigation
or
for
example,
a
complex
formula
based
on
the
success
in
litigation.
but
the
attorney
fee
in
our
view--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--yes.
i
believe
the
relevant
inquiry--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--but,
justice
o'connor.
i
believe
that
clearly
in
1965,
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
adopt
for
this
statute
the
lodestar
method
given
that
the
lodestar
method
had
not
been
invented
until
a
decade
or
so
later
and
not
really
adopted
by
this
court
until
its
decision
in--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--yes.
yes,
justice
kennedy,
and
when
a
court
was
involved,
the
question
would
be
whether
the
agreed
upon
fee
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
the
court
would
not
itself
in
the
context
when
there
was
an
existing
fee,
fee
agreement
determine
what
it
felt
was
the
most
appropriate
fee,
so
the
primary
question
when
there
is
a
fee
agreement
and
a
fee
request
is
whether
the
fee
request,
the
agreed
upon
fee
is
reasonable.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes,
justice
kennedy.
for
several
reasons
the
attorney
fee
that
the
district
courts
in
ninth
circuit
set
was
not
reasonable.
first
and
foremost,
the
district
courts
did
not
address
the
primary
question
whether
the
agreed
upon
fee
was
a
reasonable
fee.
second,
the
district
court
who
decided,
who
ordered
the
fees
in
gisbrecht,
miller
and
sandine,
did
not
take
into
account,
did
not
have
the
attorney
fees
reflect
the
contingent
nature
of
the
fee.
the
district
courts
awarded
in
all
three
cases
noncontingent
hourly
rates,
noncontingent
fees
when
by
law,
the
attorney
fee
must
be
contingent
on
success.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes.
because
when
an
attorney
fee
is
contingent
on
success
in
the
litigation,
the
attorney
fee
should
reflect
the
contingent
nature
of
the
fee.
in
this
case,
even
if
there
were
not
a
prohibition
on
charging
noncontingent
fee,
the
parties
had
freely
contracted
that
the
attorney
would
be
paid
more
taking
into
account
the
risk
of
loss.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
the
practice
before
1965
is
relevant.
attorneys
were
entering
into
contingent
fee
agreements
with
their
clients
to
represent
full
representation
in
civil
actions.
congress
in
an
act
in
406(b),
did
not
void
those
agreements,
did
not
say
that
attorneys
should
not
charge
a
contingent
fee,
but
instead,
chose
to
regulate
the
contingent
fee
agreements.
if
congress
had,
if
congress
had
intended
to
prohibit
attorneys
from
engaging,
from
making
contingent
fee
agreements
with
their
clients,
force
representation
in
federal
court,
congress
really
could
have
said
so.
i
think
we
have
cited.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
no.
(b)(1)(a)
reflects
that
the
attorney
be
must
be
contingent
upon
a
favorable
judgment.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
right.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
we
believe
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
expressed
by
congress
is
fully
implemented
by
our
view.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes,
justice--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--well,
there
are
significant
variations
of
the
lodestar
method.
the
government
now
proposes
that
the
lodestar
method
be
the
lodestar
method
from
the
fee
shifting
context,
not
taking
into
account
the
contingent
nature.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
justice,
i
believe
there
are
variations.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
we
ask
the
court
to,
to
specify
that
when
a
district
court
determines
a
reasonable
fee
under
406(b)
it
should
start
by
asking
first
the
question
what
is
the
agreed
upon
amount
and
is
the
agreed
upon
amount--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--i
believe,
justice
breyer,
that
there
could
be
possible,
you
could
allow
different
circuits
to
do
things
in
different
ways,
but
the
interest
is
in
uniform
federal
law.
i
believe
that
the
method,
the
traditional
method
of
determining
contingent
fee
is
best
served,
best
serves
the
purpose
of
the
act.
hence
the
lodestar
calculation
is
generally
an
expensive,
time-consuming
endeavor
best
suited
to
complex
litigation.
social
security
cases
only
take
generally
30,
40
or
50
hours
to
accomplish.
if
attorney
fee
litigation
using,
trying
to
proof
up
the
hensley
hourly
rate
is
required,
then
attorneys
will
have
to
spend
five,
maybe
10,
in
this
case
much
more
hours
trying
to
collect
a
compensatory
fee.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes.
justice
scalia.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
the
statute
does
not
say.
that
the
statute
does
not
require
the
agency
to
ignore
an
agreement
between
a
plaintiff
or
a
claimant
and
his
or
her
attorney
when
determining
a
fee
for
administrative
work.
in
fact,
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
regulations--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--yes,
justice
scalia.
in
that
way
406(b)
and
406(a)
are
the
same.
to
the
extent
that
any
agreement
between
an
attorney
and
the
social
security
claimant
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute
provision
that
agreement
is
void.
the
long-standing
provision--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--yes.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
the
statute
there
is
elucidative
of
congress'
acknowledgment
and
lass
the
agency's
acknowledgment
of
the
capacity
of
social
security
claimants
to
contract
with
their
attorneys
for
representation
in
federal
court.
we
are
not
asking
specifically
for
the
court
to
adopt
the
presumption,
the
conclusive
presumption
in
406(a)(2),
instead,
we
maintain
that
the
attorney
has
the
ability,
has
the
burden
as
the
fee
applicant
to
establish
the
reasonableness
of
the
fee.
that
is
somewhat
different
than
the
more
lenient
rules
of
406(a)(2).
mr.
eric
schnaufer
justice
ginsburg,
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
the
claimant
was
represented
during
the
administrative
proceedings.
if
the
claimant
was
represented
during
the
administrative
proceedings,
then
the
claimant's
attorney
can
apply
to
the
agency
for
compensation
for
their
services
after
the--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--yes.
they
are
dual
entitlement.
the
attorney
with
seek
both
406(b)
fees
from
the
court,
for
the
court
work,
and
406(a)
fees
from
the
agency
for
the
agency
work.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
i
believe
that
congress
does,
has
addressed
specifically
on
occasion
when
a
court,
when
the
court
should
look
to
an
agreement
or
the
agency
should
look
to
the
agreement
to
determine
a
reasonable
fee.
however,
i
believe
that
in
the
context
of
the
legal
context
in
1965,
congress
would
have
understood
that
a
district
court
determining
a
reasonable
fee
for
representation
in
court
for
the...
would
look
first
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
contract
between
the
attorney
and
the
claimant
and
whether
or
not
the
agreement
upon
amount
was
reasonable.
that
would
be
the
method
by
which
the
judge
would
be
expected
to
proceed.
the
judge
would
not
be
expected
to
determine
independently
a
lodestar
amount
or
try
to
determine
a
reasonable
fee.
if
the
fee
agreed
to
between
the
attorney
and
the
client
was
reasonable,
then
that
fee
would
be
approved.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes,
but
with
important
differences.
the
406(a)(2)
administrative
fees
creates
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
fee.
we
are
saying
that
the
attorney
has
the
burden
under
406(b)
to
prove
the
reasonableness
of
the
fee.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
there
is
any
presumption
that
the
fee
requested
or
that
25
percent
is
a
reasonable
fee.
the
attorney
has
to
prove
that
the
reasonable
fee
is
the
agreed
upon
fee.
of
course,
it's
important
in
many
cases
the
attorney
will
not
request
the
full
agreed
upon
fee
but
oftentimes
will
request
much
less.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
anderson
that
this
court
denied
cert
on,
the
request
was
not
for
the
full
amount
of
the
contract,
but
for
significantly
less.
i
believe
the
attorneys
have
a
strong
interest
in
not
making,
requesting
inordinately
large
fees
from
the
court
because
one,
it
would
be
improper,
unreasonable,
two,
the
government
would
be
likely
to
object,
and
three,
the
court
would
be
unlikely
to
award
it
and
so
attorneys
generally
are
going
to
make
a
fee
request
to
the
court
under
406(b),
they
are
going
to
be
within
the
raping
of
reasonableness.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
justice
ginsburg,
our
objection
to
the
lodestar
method
depends
on
how
you,
what
you
mean
by
the
lodestar
method.
there
is
a
lodestar
method
using
the
fee
shifting
context
that
is
a
noncontingent
fee.
there
is
also
a
lodestar
method
that
may
allow
enhancement
for
contingency
and
that
would
be
a
fee-shifting
context.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
hourly
rates
used
were
established
as
noncontingent
hourly
rates
however
since
the
attorney
services
were
contingent
on
success,
an
attorney
fee
awarded
at
that
rate
would
not
be
fully
compensatory.
that
when
an
attorney
fee
is
contingent
on
success,
the
attorney
fee,
a
reasonable
attorney
fee
should
reflect
the
contingent
nature.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes.
mr.
chief
justice.
in
this
case,
the
government
maintained
that
$125
for
one
attorney
was
the
appropriate
reasonable
noncontingent
hourly
rate,
however,
the
government
also
concedes
that
the
class-based
risk
of
loss
in
these
cases
is
two
out
of
three.
we
have
set
forth
agency's
own
statistics
showing
that
1/3
of
social
security
plaintiffs
end
up
receiving
past
due
benefits
and
so
on
average,
an
attorney
will
receive
1/3
of
that
noncontingent
hourly
rate
if
that
noncontingent
hourly
rate
is
all
the
compensation
that
the
attorney
can
obtain.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
if
the
statute
specified
a
5
percent
maximum
fee
or
10
percent
maximum
fee,
the
attorneys
would
also
generally
charge,
almost
universally
charge
that
same
five
or
10
percent.
it's
important
to
take
a
look
at
the
25
percent
cap
on
past
due
benefits
in
relative
context.
this
is
25
percent
of
past
due
benefits.
it's
not
25
percent
of
the
whole
value
of
the
case.
in
normal
civil
litigation
an
attorney
recovers
not
25
percent
of
a
small
part
of
the
judgment
but
the
lifetime
benefit.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
i
think
that,
justice
scalia,
i
think
in
this
case
it's
useful
to
look
at
an
example
and
see
what
that
25
percent
cap
actually
does.
the
government
in
this
case
maintained
that
the
noncontingent
hourly
rate
was
$125
per
attorney.
also
the
government
does
not
dispute
that
the
risk
of
loss
is
one
in
three
and
so
a
fully
compensatory
hourly
rate
would
multiply
that
hourly
rate
times
a
three
multiplier
for
$375
an
hour.
however,
in
these
cases,
the
actual,
the
25
percent
cap
came
in,
would
have
been
met
at
$280,
$190
and
roughly
$270.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
the
hourly--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that
the
government
concedes
that
there
is
a
preloss
in
a
typical
title
ii
case
and
also
the
government's
position
was
that
the
appropriate
noncontingent
win,
lose
or
draw
hourly
rate
was
$125
for
one
of
these
attorneys.
therefore,
under
the
government
scheme,
paying
$125
an
hour
to
an
attorney
for
services
will
only
mean
that
the
only
grosses
only
$44,
roughly,
roughly
a
third
of
that
amount.
and
so
the
way
the
government
is
counting,
the
establishing
of
the
hourly
rate
at
$125,
admitting
to
the
class
based
risk
of
loss
as
one
of
not
contesting
that,
can
you
see
that
the
attorney's
recovery
is
actually
much
lower
than
that
noncontingent
hourly
rate,
given
the--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
that
would
accomplish
the
goal
readily,
a
local
district
court
could
adopt
such
a
rule
which
would
be
consistent
in
406(b).
i
think
that
the
court
should
also
at
the
same
time
consider
whether
or
not
there
is
any
offsetting
award
under
the
equal
access
justice
act.
also,
whether
or
not
there
is
any
fee,
fee
liability
under
406(a).
mr.
eric
schnaufer
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
the
district
court
judge
disputed
whether
there
was
any
special
expertise
involved.
the
government
did
not
contest
that
all
the
hours
in
these
cases
were
reasonably
spent,
the
25
hours,
the
39
and
the
52
hours.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
the
district
court
judge
did
award
the
number
of
hours
requested.
the
district
court
judge
did
not
reduce
the
hours
at
all
in
terms
of
the
hours.
i'd
like
to
take
the
rest--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--the
statute
concerns
how
much
the
client
will
actually
end
up
paying
his
or
her
attorneys
that
the
equal
access
justice
act--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
--all
right.
yes.
a
reasonable
amount.
and
for
example,
the
out-of-pocket
attorneys
fees
in
this
case
with
the
eaja
offset
was
29,675
for
all
three
claimants
who
received
$114,000
in
back
benefits.
and
so
in
that
context
i
believe
that
the
attorney
fees,
the
judge
should
consider
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
because
how
much
the
claimant
pays
is
very
important.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
the
eaja
itself,
the
offset
provision
states
that
the
attorney
should
keep
the
larger
of
the
406(b)
and
the
eaja
fee
so
the
statute
itself
contemplates
that
the
attorney
is
entitled
to
the
larger
fee.
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes.
we
rely
quite
heavily,
justice
ginsburg,
on
this
court's
decision
on
venegas
vs.
mitchell,
recognizing
that
an
attorney
fee
paid
by
a
client
to
his
or
her
own
attorney
can
be
in
addition
to
the
amount
of
a
fee-shifting
statute.
a
fee-shifting
statute
such
as
the
eaja
will
not
provide
a
fully
against
tore
fee
in
almost
all
cases.
this
is
particularly
true
since
the
eaja's
hourly
rate
has
an
artificial
cap.
it
is
not
the
prevailing
market
rate
based
upon
the
attorney's
services
in
the
legal
community.
if
i
may,
i
take
the--
mr.
eric
schnaufer
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
that
the
government's
position
is
a
bold
new
position.
the
government
has
not
previously
advanced
except
for
in
its
brief
that
all
circuits
are
wrong,
that
even
the
lodestar
jurisdictions
are
wrong.
that
no
one
can,
no
enhancements
for
contingencies
can
ever
be
permitted
and
so
the
agency
cannot
rely
on
the
experience
in
the
circuit
lodestar
to
say
that
this
method
is
the
preferable
method.
claimants
need
attorneys.
in
these
cases
the
government
conceded
that
the
agency's
position,
underlying
agency
position
was
not
substantially
justified
without
attorneys
whose
claimants
most
likely
would
never
receive
the
benefits
that
they
were
due.
justice
stevens,
you
asked
about
possibly
about
the
eaja
of
lodestar.
there
are
many
reasons
why
the
eaja,
equal
access
justice
act
is
not
the
lodestar
amount.
the
eaja
has
an
artificial
hourly
rate
capped
below
the
prevailing
market
rate.
the
eaja
also
often
represents
a
settlement
of
the
parties
for
the
risk
of
litigating
the
substantial
justification
issue.
and
so
we
cannot
rely,
just
because
there
is
an
equal
access
justice
act
award,
there
is
not
in
the
case
already
a
lodestar
amount.
then
i
guess
i
think
it
allows
this
court
to
distinguish
easily
dague.
dague
should
not
be
applied
outside
of
the
fee-shifting
context
because
as
its
request,
a
plaintiff
should
be
able
to
pay
his
or
her
own
attorney
to
take
into
account
the
risk
of
loss.
justice
o'connor,
i
think
was
asking
whether
or
not
contingency
could
be
taken
into
account
by
a
district
court
in
determining
the
fee.
i
believe
that
if
this
court
can
direct
that
the
lodestar
method
be
adopted
to
enhance
for
contingency
reflecting
the
necessary
contingent
nature
of
the
claim
or
the
court
can
use
a
contingent
fee
method,
there
again
looking
at
the
contingent
nature
of
the
fee,
regardless
of
which
way
the
court
goes,
the
court
allows
more
than
one
method.
i
brief
that
the
contingent
nature
of
social
security
cases
should
be
taken
into
account.
the
government
describes
dependence.
the
government
objects
that
attorney
fee
awards
would
be
arbitrarily
different
based
upon
the
number
of
dependents.
the
government
lost
that
issue
in
hopkins
vs.
cohen
in
1968.
this
court
held
in
hopkins
the
number...
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
