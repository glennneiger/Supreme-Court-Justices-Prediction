mr.
david
b.
salmons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
for
three
reasons
the
court
should
use
the
lodestar
method
to
determine
and
award
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
under
the
social
security
act.
first,
the
lodestar
method
best
reflects
the
plain
language
and
purposes
of
section
406(b).
second,
it
is
consistent
with
the
strong
presumption
in
favor
of
the
lodestar
approach
announced
in
this
court,
attorneys'
fees
cases
and
third
it
best
furthers
the
statute's
directive
that
the
fees
awarded
in
each
case
must
be
reasonable.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
the
lodestar
method
permits
district
courts
to
take
a
number
of
factors
into
account
in
determining
the
reasonable
hourly
rate
and
the
reasonable
fee
under
this
court's
decision
in
dague,
however,
courts
are
not
permitted
to
increase
what
would
otherwise
be
a
reasonable
fee
based
on
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
contingent.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no,
your
honor.
i
think
under
dague
that
would
not
be
permissible.
this
court
in
dague--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
i
think
there
are
at
least
the
three
responses
to
that.
first,
this
court
in
dague
rejected
the
notion
that
contingency
enhancements
were
necessary
in
order
to
determine
a
reasonable
fee
in
the
context
of
fee-shifting
statutes.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that
involved
section
1988,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
i
think
the
statutory
language
is
open
to
this
court
and
to
courts
generally
to
construe
a
standard
that
best
furthers
the
purposes
of
the
act.
this
court
has
long
held--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
it
certainly
leaves
it
up
to
courts.
that's
true
in
fee-shifting
statutes
as
well
as
with
this
statute.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
i
think
actually
to
the
contrary
in
the
contempt
of
fee-shifting
statutes
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
the
purpose
of
those
statutes
is
merely
to
encourage
lawyers
to
undertake
that
litigation,
and
nevertheless,
this
court
has
said
that
a
contingent
enhancement
is
not
necessary
to
provide
that
extra
inducement
that
a
lodestar
calculation
is
adequate
and
appropriate
in
striking
the
balance
that
congress
intended
when
congress
only
intends
to
encourage
litigation.
in
this
context,
by
contrast,
section
406(b)
is
not
merely
a
statute
designed
to
encourage
litigation,
but
is
designed
to
protect
social
security
claimants
and
their
awards
of
back--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
that,
that
is
simply
not
our
position.
it
is
not
our
position
the
courts
must
be
blind
to
the
realities
of
this
practice.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
those
numbers
obviously
vary.
lawyers
in
this
kind
of
environment
are
prevailing
all
of
the
time.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
one
thing
that's
important
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
congress
struck
the
balance
in
this
statute
between
protecting
claims
and
encouraging
lawyers.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
if
what
you
mean
by
take
into
account--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that
the
court
can
increase
the
hourly
rate
in
order
to
provide
a
subsidy
from
prevailing
social
security
claimants
to
losing
social
security
claimants,
i
think
that
would
be
inappropriate
under
this
statute
and
under
this
court's
decisions
in
dague,
which
although
it
is
a
different
context,
i
think
the
difference
is
quite
strongly
in
favor
of
applying
the
same
rule
here.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
the
point
i
was
making
is
that
it
certainly
is
available
to
this
court
to
set
a
standard
for
courts
to
apply.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
address,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
think
the
reason
why
this
court
should
not
adopt
a
rule
that
would
require
the
shifting
of
benefits
in
effect
from
successful
social
security--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--but
your
honor,
that's
not
necessarily
true.
i
mean,
individual
cases,
the
riskiness
of
individual
cases
is
going
to
vary
widely.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct.
that's
exactly
right.
and
that's
the
way
this
court--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that's
the
way
this
court
addressed
it.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that
same
analysis--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
reason
this
court
should
view
contingency
enhancements
in
this
context
as
inappropriate
is
because
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute
primarily
designed
to
protect
the
benefits
of
successful
social
security
claims.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
the
statute
has...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
statute
has
two
provisions.
one
is
that
it
sets
an
upper
bound
of
a
reasonable
fee
which
is
25
percent
but
more
precisely--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--it
does
not
necessarily
suggest
that,
no.
what
we
are
talking...
what
i
think
the
question
as
justice
breyer
posed
was
more
an
a
policy
level,
why
should
this
court
adopt
a
rule
that
would
allow
those
kinds
of
enhancements
and
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
why
that's
inappropriate
in
this
context
is
because
the
purpose
here
is
not
just
to
encourage
lawyers
to
take
these
cases,
which
was
the
case
in
the
fee-shifting
statutes
where
this
court
said
enhancements
aren't
necessary.
the
purpose
here
is
to
protect
claimants
and
it
would
be
particularly
inappropriate--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that
is,
that
is
a
purpose,
but
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
in
regards
to
the
language
we
are
focusing
on
of
the
reasonable
fee,
that
is
not
the
primary
purpose.
there
is
a
separate
provision
in
406(b)
where
congress
addressed
the
question
of
the
problem
of
encouraging
lawyers
to
take
these
lawsuits.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
that
would
probably
depend
on
what
some
of
his
alternatives
were.
i
don't
mean
that
in
any
sort
of
derogatory
way,
but
it
is
not
the
case
that
lawyers
cannot
make
a
sufficient
wage
under
the
lodestar
method.
it's
important
to
remember
that
there
are
at
least
six
circuits
who
have
been
applying
the
lodestar
method.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
that
would
certainly
be
a
one
way
to
interpret
a
statute
that
i
think
on
the
text
of
the
statute
there
is
nothing
that
would
prohibit
it.
i
think
there
are
strong
reasons
why
this
court
may
want
to
provide
some
guidance.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
for
federal
rules.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
do
agree
that's
desirable,
but
i
think
the
lodestar
method
is
the
best
way
to
do
that.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
largely
be
in
compliance
with
lodestar
method,
although
not
under
this
court's
decision
in
dague
which
has
prohibited
the
consideration
of
contingency
enhancements.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no,
your
honor,
that
was
not
the
context
of
1988.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
i
think
this
court
should
adopt
the
same
rule
and
it's
because
the
reasons
this
court
adopted
the
rule
that
it
did
in
the
context
of
fee-shifting
statutes
was
not
because
there
was
still
some
possibility
that
lawyers
could
negotiate
fees
even
that
won
on
a
contingent
basis.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
um--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
the
commissioner
does
interpret
406(b)
to
require
only
contingent
fees,
that
it
prohibits
a
lawyer
from
charging
fees
when
there
is
no
award
of
back
benefits.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
we
think
that
in
light
of,
of
the
terms
of
406(b),
its
purpose
is
in
the
structure
with,
with
the
provision
that
would
make
it
in
fact
a
crime
to
charge
more.
but
the
best
way
to
read
that
is
to
require
that
only
fees
that
have
been
authorized
by
a
court
can
be
charged.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
regulation
that
simply
addresses
that.
to
be
honest
with
you,
it
is
not
an
issue
that
has
really
come
up
because
lawyers
as
the
record
here
again
reflects,
have
a
universal
practice
of
entering
into
fee
agreements
that
say
25
percent
contingency
at
the
statutory
maximum
and
their
contingent
fees
so
it's
just
not
an
issue
that
comes
up.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no,
your
honor.
the
statute
says
the
relevant
language
of
the
statute
says
the
courts
will
determine
a
reasonable
fee,
and
we--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that
is
correct.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
let
me
if
i
may
address
your
last
point
first.
that
is
to
say
that
the
commissioner's
experience
with
the
lodestar
method
in
the
numerous
circuits
that
apply
it
is
not
that
it
is
difficult
to
apply,
but
keep
in
mind,
your
honors,
that
in
most
of
these
cases,
the
lawyers
are
also
seeking
eaja
fees
and
so
the
very
same
court
that's
going
to
consider
the
406(b)
fee
claim
has
already
undertaken
a
lodestar
analysis
to
determine
a
reasonable
number
of
hours
and
then
the
rate
is
determined
by
eaja,
but
the
commissioner's
experience
is
that
the
lodestar
method
is
not
difficult
to
apply
and
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
certainly
in
most
circuits,
the
commissioner
doesn't
object
to
most
of
the
fee
claims
because
they
are
reasonable.
the
courts
have
determined
standards
for
what
reasonable
rates
are
in
the
relevant
prevailing
markets.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
i
think
the
only
thing
unfair
in
that
sense
is
that
congress
here
has
determined
that
the
market
for
legal
services
in
the
social
security
context
was
failing
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act,
and
that
lawyers
had
unequal
bargaining
power
and
were
charging
inordinately
large
contingency
fees--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct.
it's
a
standard
that
course
seem
to
find
on
a
regular
basis
in
these
cases,
but
that
is
the
standard.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
i
think
the
government
lawyers
in
each
case
would
look
at
the
prevailing
circuit
law
or,
of
the
jurisdiction,
would
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case
and
make
the
determination.
in
most
of
these
cases,
eaja
fees
seem
to
be
awarded
and
the
resolution
of
those
fees
doesn't
take
a
lot
of
time.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
my
point,
your
honor,
is
just
one
of
the
things
i
think
that's
keeping,
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
in
these
cases
is
that
they,
by
their
nature,
tend
to
be
very
routine
and
so
both
in
terms
of
awarding
eaja
fees
and
in
terms
of
awarding
406(b)
fees,
it
is
not
very
difficult
for
courts
to
develop
practices
in
these
cases
that,
that
result
in
a
very
expedited
process,
and
that
in
fact,
that
is,
that
is
the
way
the
lodestar
method
is
applied
and
i,
and
it
seems
to
me,
your
honors,
that
the
alternative
that's
being
proposed
would
largely
frustrate
the
purpose
that
justice
stevens
was
identifying
of
the
need
for
some
sort
of
expedited
procedures
here.
they
point
to
four
additional
factors
that
aren't
lodestar
factors
that
they
think
courts
should
take
into
account.
some
of
the
contingency
circuits
who
have
adopted
some
modified
contingency
rule
have
added
additional
factors,
including
requiring
courts
to
ask
whether
the
claimants
had
been
notified
that
there
were
other
options
other
than
the
25
percent
contingent
fee
which
under
the
facts
of
this
case
we
were
told
the
lawyers
would
never
do.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
that
is,
in
the
context
of
406(b)
cases?
mr.
david
b.
salmons
there
are
no...
the
agency
does
not
specifically
keep
statistics
on
that,
although
i
did
discuss
that
with
the
relevant
agency
personnel
and
was
informed
that
in
fact
the
agency
very
rarely
seeks
an
appeal
unless
the
case
involves
some
broader
legal
principle
that
the
agency
determines
is
important
to
litigation.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
do
not
have
any
figures
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
statistical
or
other
information
that's
directly
on
point,
although
i
could
think
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
standards
of
review
among
other
things
have
a
lot
to
do
with
the
outcome
of
these
cases,
and
that,
and
that
the
general
statistics
that
the
courts
provide
through,
for
example,
the
federal
judiciary
home
page
that
tracks
different
types
of
cases
in
different
circuits,
for
example,
shows
that
there
has
been
dramatic
increases
in
the
number
of
title
ii
disability
lawsuits
that
are
filed
initially
in
district
courts
between
the
period
of
1990
to
2000.
in
fact,
that
they
have
tripled.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
not
that
i
have
seen.
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
numbers
that
i
have
seen
suggest
that
the
percentage
of
cases
that
win
before
the
agency
has
been
relatively
consistent.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
surely
don't
want
to
overstate
it.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
the
point
i
was
attempting
to
make,
your
honor--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no.
not
at
all.
your
honor.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
there
aren't
any
hard
statistics
that
show
how
the
different
legal
rules
have
having
an
effect
on
litigants
in
this
context,
but
the
general--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that's
correct.
and
that's,
that's
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
your
honor.
that
all
that
we
can
tell
is
that
one,
the
commissioner
has
not
been
flooded
with
complaints
in
the
circuits
that
applied
the
lodestar,
which
is
the
dominant
method
and
has
been
for
over
10
years.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no.
my
point
is
that
there
are,
there
are,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
rules
are
having
that
dramatic
of
an
effect
on
the
availability
of
counsel.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that
is
certainly
an
option
that
is
before
this
court.
the
government's
position
is
that
if
the
court
is
going
to
address
the
issue
of
what
standards
should
be
applied,
that
the
best
way
for
this
court
to
do
it
is
to
specify
that
the
lodestar
method
is
the
best
method,
and
that
includes--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
i
don't
have
that
figure.
i
can
tell
you
that
in
terms
of
hourly
rates,
for
example,
i--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--it
varied
in
the,
in
the
cases.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
think
one
way
to
sort
of
try
and
track
that
is
that
what
the
claimants
lawyers
in
these
cases
did
was
because
they
recognized
they
were
in
a
lodestar
circuit,
they
had,
they
kept
the
same
number
of
reasonable
hours
they
would
use
for
their
eaja
fees
which
the
government
did
not
contest
and
then
they
just
divided
that
by
the
25
percent
figure
and
came
up
with
an
hourly
rate.
so
the
hourly
rates
they
sought
in
these
cases
ranged
from
around
$180
an
hour
to
nearly
$300
an
hour.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
has--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
let
me
make
two
points
very
quickly.
one
is
that
when
congress
enacted
this
statute,
it
recognized
not
only
that
lawyers
were
charging
an
inordinately
large
percentage
in
terms
of
their
contingency
fees,
but
there
was
an
inherent
problem
with
contingency
fees
because
in
this
context
they
do
not
track
the
value,
a
reasonable
value
of
legal
services.
they
turn
unnecessarily
on
factors
such
as
the
number
of
dependents
and
the
amount
of
delay
that
it
takes
in
order
to
get
the
benefits
over
which
time
the
benefits
continued
to
accrue
which
just
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
amount,
the
value
of
the
legal
services
provider.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that
is
the
government's
position,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
lodestar
method.
let
me
just
see
if
i
can,
and
be
very
clear.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
yes.
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
but,
your
honor,
there
is
no,
there
is
no
evidence
of
that.
and
in
fact
the
evidence
that
it
does
exist
is
to
the
contrary.
there
are
six
circuits
that
have
been
employing
the
lodestar
method
for,
for
decades
without
any
evidence
that
there
is
a
failure
of
lawyers
who
want
to
take
these
cases.
the
lawyers
in
these
cases
submitted
affidavits
that
said
we,
we
practice
regularly
in
federal
courts
in
title
ii
cases
and
we
have
been
doing
it
for
years
and
years
and
that's
in
the
context
of
lodestar
statutes.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
that
would
certainly
be
an
alternative
availability
to
congress.
the
difference
would
be
the
statutory
language
would
prohibit
this
court
from
adopting
a
rule
that
would
look
primarily
to
the
fee
contracts.
congress
knows
how
to
write
that
kind
of
statute
when
it
wants
to.
it
did
so
in
406(a)(2).
it
has
not
done
so
here.
another
point
i
would
like
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that,
is
that
these
cases
are,
as
both
sides
seem
to
agree,
are
somewhat
unique
in
that
they
generally
require
a
very
low
number
of
hours.
they
don't
require
the
same
kinds
of
risk
undertaken
by
the
lawyers
as
other
contingent
fee
cases
do.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
disagree,
your
honor,
because
of
the
court's
experience,
the
lodestar
method,
i
think
that's
the
most
efficient
way
for
courts
to
determine
the
fee.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
do
not.
one
other
thing
that
i
think--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
the
agency
has
not
experienced
any
particular
problem
under
either
of
these
standards.
we
do
think
that
the
lodestar
method
as
this
court
announced
it
in
dague
is
the
best
way
to
effectuate
congress'
intent
under
the
purposes
of
this
statute.
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
congress
has
already
provided
a
mechanism
to
ensure
adequate
counsel
here,
and
that
is
the
payment
out
of
the
back
benefit
awards
directly
to
the
lawyer.
that's
different
than
in
other
contingent
fee
contexts.
so
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
need
to
encourage
counsel
and
it
provided
a
provision
to
do
that.
it
struck
the
balance,
and
then
it
requires
the
courts
to
determine
the
reasonable
fee
in
each
case
based
on
a
fair
value
of
the
legal
services
provided
and
this
court
has
long
held
that
there
is
a
strong
presumption
that
when
congress
says
courts
determine
a
reasonable
fee,
congress
means
the
lodestar
method.
if
the
lodestar
method--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
courts
used
a
variety
of
standards
before
as
they
did
under
other
fee
statutes.
the
fact
that
the
lodestar
method
wasn't
fully
developed
didn't
prevent
this
court
from
adopting
it
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
for
example,
but
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
lodestar
method,
it's
not
the
case
the
courts
were
routinely
deferring
to
the
fee
contracts.
