justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
before
lodestar,
there
were
other
descriptions
for
reasonable
fees
that
depended
on
hours,
degree
of
difficulty,
etcetera
etcetera.
i
mean,
lawyers
did
that
for
decades.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
this
is
a
very
difficult
case
because
either
way,
we
are
going
to
be,
i
mean
on
which
circuits
involved,
we
are
going
to
be
upsetting
standard
arrangements,
contingent
fees
in
some
cases.
in
this
case,
in
the
ninth
circuit,
are
you
saying
that
the
fee,
the
fee
the
ninth
circuit
set
was
not
reasonable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but,
of
course,
that
assumes
that
you
are
correct
here.
but
based
on
a
standard
of
fair
compensation,
was
this
unfair
compensation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
quite
without
reference
to
your
statutory
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
multiplication
assumes
a
fictitious
market.
if
i'm
an
attorney
and
i'm
practicing
in
this
area
and
i
know
i'm
going
to
win
only
one
out
of
every
three
cases,
i'm
going
to
tell
the
judge
my
hourly
rate
in
order
to
make
a
decent
level
in
this
part
of
the
law
and
this
special
is
x
dollars
an
hour,
$150
an
hour.
i
have
to
get
that.
and
i
take
it
the
trial
judge
would
say
yes,
that's
right,
$150
an
hour
is
the
prevailing
rate.
that's
what
you
get.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you,
you,
you
made
the
assumption
of
a,
of
a
fictitious
market.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
a
reasonable
fee
if
it
included
in
the
hourly
rate
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
is
only
a
1/3
success
rate?
as
a
judge,
i
want
to
practice
in
this
area.
i
know
the
area
very
well.
i
win
only
a
third
of
the
time,
therefore
my
hourly
rate
takes
into
account
the
fact
that
i'm
going
to
win
only
a
third
of
the
time
and
my
hourly
rate
is
$200
an
hour.
can
the
district
judge
accept
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
that's
a
false
market
the
district
judge
is
using
in
order
to
award
the
fee.
i
don't
understand
that.
and,
of
course,
i
see
the
consistency
of
your
position
because
if
you
said
yes
well
then
i
would
say
well
doesn't
the
contingency
fee
do
the
same
thing.
so
i'm...
but...
i'm
concerned
about
how
the
district
judge
can
award
in
effect
just
$40
an
hour.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
can't
understand
your
position
that
a
reasonable
fee
must
be
determined
without
regards
to
the
realities
of
the
special
practice.
i
just
don't
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
one
of
the
realities
that
you
can
win
only
a
third
of
the
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
that
is
a
given
in
the
particular
community
and
in
the
particular
practice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
case
that
i
put,
can
the
judge
or
cannot
the
judge
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
attorney
is
going
to
win
only
a
third
of
the
time?
this
is
his
only
practice.
this
is
all
he
does.
he
is
a
specialist.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
the
hourly
rate--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
the
purpose
to
give
fair
compensation
to
members
of
the
bar?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
you
had
a
good
friend
and
he
said
i'm
going
to
go
into
social
security
work.
i,
i
know
the
area
very
well.
it's
going
to
be
my
specialty.
i'm
going
to
win
a
third
of
the
time.
i'm
going
to
in
effect
get
$40
an
hour.
would
you
advice
him
to
go
into
that
part
of
the
practice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
statute
says
all
fees
are
contingent
and
the
government
says
there
can
be
no
contingent
fees?
that's
where
we
are
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
wasn't
it
about
half
of
what
the
contingency
would
have
been?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
beyond
the
record,
do
you
have
any
statistics
on
how
often
contingent
fees
are
reduced
in
the
contingency
circuits?
