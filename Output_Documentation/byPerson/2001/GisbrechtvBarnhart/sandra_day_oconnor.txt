well,
if
the
statute,
406(b)
reads
as
though
when
there
is
a
judgment
favorable
to
the
claimant,
the
court
may
allow
a
reasonable
fee.
and
could
apparently
determine
that
fee
any
way
it
saw
fit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
suggests
perhaps
that
the
court
would
allow
a
fee,
but
it
seems
open-ended
that
it
will
allow
the
court
to
determine
the
fee
any
way
it
wants
on
the
lodestar
method
or
via,
by
some
other
method.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
think
the
language
of
the
statute
requires
a
contingent
fee?
at
only
reasonable
fee
can
be
a
contingent
fee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
think
that
the
implication
of
this
statute
is
that
the
court
has
to
base
it
on
the
agreement
of
the
attorney
and
the
attorney's
client?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
it
done
say
that.
i
think
you
are
reading
something
in
that
isn't
there.
and
you
are
basing
that
on
practice
of
lawyers
at
the
time
or
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
in
that
case,
what
statute
were
we
interpreting?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
not
this
one.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
cases
like
this
where
there
is
a
low
success
rate,
and
where
the
language
of
the
statute
says
a
reasonable
fee.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
why
isn't
the
court,
why
can't
the
court
determine
it
as
it
wishes,
so
long
as
it
finds
at
the
end
of
the
day
it's
reasonable?
an
hourly
rate
that
it
enhances
somewhat
or
the
risk
factor,
or
even
a
contingent
fee
could
be
reasonable,
as
long
as
it
doesn't
exceed
25
percent.
doesn't
this
statutory
language
leave
that
open?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
statute
requires
that
one
particular
method
be
selected
or
does
it
leave
it
up
to
the
judge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
but
the
statute
itself
speaks,
sets
a
kept,
a
contingent
fee
of
no
more
than
25
percent.
i
mean
the
statute
itself
refers
to
that
as
a
cap.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
does
not
suggest
that
there
can
never
be
a
contingency
factor,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
why
don't
we
leave
it
alone?
let
the
judge
do
it?
