here
were
arguing
on
behalf
of
the
employee.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
that
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
basis
that
they're
an
agent
of
an
agent,
that
we
we're
not
going
to
track
it
that
far
down.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
concede
that
you
have
a
perfectly
valid
remedy,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
purchaser
gets
its
money
from
everybody.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
argument
which
which
you
make,
that
we
shouldn't...
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be,
in
effect,
the
same
as
holding
the
government
liable.
justice
antonin
scalia
judgments
against
the
corporation
than
than
than
against
jack
armstrong
personally.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
just
decides
that
we're
wrong
in
saying
that
there's
a
bivens
remedy
here,
what
what
could
what
could
congress
possibly
do
about
it?
i
mean,
if
if
there
is
a
bivens
remedy
here,
it's
one
that's
demanded
by
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pasternak,
do
you
think
running
municipally
owned
utility
is
a
core
governmental
function?
justice
antonin
scalia
may
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
whole
new
area
of
constitutional
or
quasi
constitutional
law
deciding
case
by
case
what
is
a
core
governmental
function
and
what
isn't
a
core
government
you
you
you
assert
that
only
only
those
corporations
that
are
performing
core
governmental
functions
would
would
be
subject
to
bivens
liability,
not
all
corporations
who
are
under
contract
with
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
ha-
have
i-
is
is
there
a
whole
line
of
cases
under
section
nineteen
eighty-three
dealing
with
this
subject
of
what
is
a
core
governmental
function?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
have
to
do
with
a,
whether
it's
performing
a
core
governmental
function
or
not?
it
has
to
do
with
whether
it's
a
federal
agency
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
concededly
private
corporation,
and
and
you
you
want
us
to
decide
case
by
case
when
w-
w-
when
you
hire
a
private
corporation
to
manage
concessions
at
a
at
a
national
park,
whether
that
is
a
core
governmental
function
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
we
leave
this
to
the
federal
government,
to
the
congress,
to
determine,
rather
than
doing
it
ourselves?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
a
totally
different
situation
from
what
bivens,
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong,
decided.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be
logical
to
extend
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
would
there
have
been
a
state
cause
of
action
against
federal
agents
acting
under
under
federal
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
special
reason
for
the
court
to
invent
a
cause
of
action
that
does
not
appear
anywhere
in
the
constitution
or
in
a
statute
for
federal
agents
who
perhaps
can't
be
sued
under
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
insurance
companies
are
going
to
increase
rates
if
the
corporation
if
they
know
that
the
corporations
are
going
to
be
liable.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
they're
not
dumb
and
and
they're
competitive.
justice
antonin
scalia
i,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
antonin
scalia
contractor
that
it
would
pass
it
on
to
w-
would
not
be
subject
to
the
same
law
that
that
the,
that
we
hold
today?
justice
antonin
scalia
his
rates
would
be
higher
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
you
might
have
punitive
damages
under
state
law,
might
not
you,
if
if
indeed
it
was
it
was
gross
negligence
or
in-
indeed
virtually
an
intentional
harming
of
of
the
prisoner?
under
many
state
laws,
you'd
be
able
to
get
punitive
damages,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
far
as
i
know,
we
haven't
held
that
punitive
damages
are
available
under
bivens,
have
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips,
i-
is
it,
is
it
correct
and
and
some
of
the
questions,
including
my
own,
have
assumed
that
you
can't
sue
a
federal
officer
in
state,
you
can't
sue
a
federal
officer
for
a
tort
committed
in
the
course
of
his
official
duties.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
federal
prohibition
against
the
suit,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
but
you
if
if
it's
not,
you
you
you
can
sue
him
and
and
the
only
prohibition
is,
if
he
wants,
he
he
can
remove
it
to
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
