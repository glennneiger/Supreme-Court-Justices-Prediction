justice
john
paul
stevens
hypothetical
that
mr.
phillips'
last
argument
suggested
to
me?
supposing
you
have
a
case
in
which
an
executive
sets
the
policy
that
everybody
has
to
climb
the
stair-
the
six
flights
of
stairs
every
day.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
the
employee
is
doing
is
carrying
out
his
instructions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
policy
also
said
any
employee
who
fails
to
carry
out
this
policy
gets
fired
forthwith.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
did
allege
that
he
was
permitted
to
to
use
the
elevator
usually,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
his
heart
attack
made
it
hard
to
climb
stairs,
but
going
down
stairs
might
be
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
know,
there's
one
puzzling
thing
about
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
therefore,
your
burden
in
the
federal
claim
under
the
eighth
amendment
is
heavier
than
in
an
ordinary
negligence
case,
isn't
it?
so,
by
going
into
federal
court,
you
you've
assumed
a
higher
burden
than
if
you
brought
a
negligence
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
quick
question?
do
you
concede,
for
purposes
of
the,
of
our
review
of
the
case
and
based
on
your
question
presented,
that
the
complaint
states
a
cause
of
action?
