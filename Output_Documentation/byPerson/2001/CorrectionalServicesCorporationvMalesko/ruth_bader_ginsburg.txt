mr.
mr.
phillips,
if
the
if
the
proper
way
of
looking
at
this
is
the
principal
agency
relationship,
when
you're
dealing
with
the
federal
government,
the
federal
government
is
the
principal,
the
agent
is
the
officer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips?
because
the
policy
of
saying
people
who
live
above
below
the
fifth
floor,
that
that's
a
policy
set
by
the
employer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
in
the
written
policy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
arguendo,
or
are
you
conceding
that?
now,
your
brief
seems
to
make
a
concession
to
that
effect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
does
it
make
a
large
difference
whether
you
sue
the
ceo
or
the
corporation
itself?
practically
in
terms
of
your
interest
as
the
government
money,
if
the
corporation
is
going
to
pick
up
the
tab,
why
does
the
government
care?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
just
wanted
us
to
decide
a
case
involving
prisons,
which
can
be
run
by
a
state,
by
the
federal
government,
or
can
be
contracted
out
by
either.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
substitute
for
a
federal
prison
just
as
sometimes
federal
prisoners
are
housed
in
state
prisons.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
would
there
b-
be
liability
in
that
situation?
suppose
this
halfway
house
had
been
run
by
the
state
of
new
york.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
if
if
mr.
malesko
had
been
a
state
prisoner?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
clarify
a
point
that
i
raised
to
mr.
phillips?
is
your
complaint
one
of
a
pattern
or
practice
attributable
to
the
corporation
as
distinguished
from
the
action
of
the
individual
guard?
he
said
that
you
did
not
plead
any
kind
of
policy
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
an
anomaly
either
way
because
why
shouldn't
the
symmetry
be
between
someone
who
is
a
federal
prisoner
in
a
federal
prison
and
someone
who's
a
federal
prisoner
in
a
private
prison?
you
recognize
that
there
would
be
no
action
against
the
bureau
of
prisons
if
the
bureau
of
prisons
had
been
the
jailer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
want
it
to
be
like
the
state
government,
because
if
it
were
a
state
if
a
state
were
running
this
prison,
then
there
would
be
liability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
respect
to
the
adequacy
of
a
remedy
in
the
state
court,
is
it
not
so
that
the
liability
would
be
greater
as
to
a
private
employee
because
the
private
employee
would
not
have
a
defense
of
qualified
immunity
that
would
be
available
to
a
federal
officer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
would
tend
to
make
the
state
law
remedy
more
adequate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ever
amended
since
your
client
gained
representation,
or
is
we
still
operating
under
the
pro
se
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
at
it's
puzzling
why
there
wasn't
enough
time
to
identify
that
individual,
mr.
urena.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lamken
said
that's
not
necessarily
so,
that
the
government
would
pay.
