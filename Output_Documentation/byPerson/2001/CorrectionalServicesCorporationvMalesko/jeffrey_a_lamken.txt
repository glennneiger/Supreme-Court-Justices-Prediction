mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
in
the
first
instance,
we
think
it
should
be
assumed
arguendo
because
if
there's
a
reason
not
to
subject
the
individuals,
the
private
individuals,
to
liability
under
bivens,
it
would
be
that
in
private
individuals
have
so
few
immunities
and
so
few
defenses,
compared
to
their
governmental
counterparts,
that
there's
no
reason
to
infer
a
federal
cause
of
action.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
pardon?
oh.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
in
fact,
with
respect
to
joint
tortfeasors,
you
have
two
separate
actions.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
you
need
to
deter
both
of
the
joint
act-
the
actions
by
the
joint
tortfeasors.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
but
the
corporation
is
an
unusual
tortfeasor
in
this
sense,
in
that
it
cannot
act
except
through
ind-
other
individuals,
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
if
this
were
a
common
law
court
or
a
legislature,
i
could
certainly
see
adopting
the
common
law
rule.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
in
fact,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at,
for
example,
the
fifth
edition
of
prosser
and
keeton
on
torts,
william
prosser
tells
us
that
that
argument
is
makeweight,
and
that
the
real
reason
for
holding
the
corporation
liable
under
respondeat
superior
is
to
ensure
that
the
costs
of
accidents
are
incorporated
into
the
price
of
products
and,
therefore,
spread
to
society
at
large.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
in
this
case,
where
where
you
have
a
uniquely
governmental
purchaser
and
a
uniquely
governmental
cause
of
action,
it
does
tend
to
have
that
effect,
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
your
honor,
when
pri-
when
prisoners
in
public
institutions,
of
federally
operated
institutions,
encounter
precisely
that...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
but
th-
it
shows
that
this
that
type
of
situation
is
hardly
unique
to
a
private
corporation.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right,
but
but
there
is
under
bivens
no
nuremberg
defense.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
would
be
the
same
thing
if
a
cons-
if
an
individual
bureau
of...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
individually
liable.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
i,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
rub
is
in
the
question,
if
the
go-
corporation
is
going
to
pick
up
the
tab.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
is
one
of
the
difficulties
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
w-
there
is
concern
that
individuals,
if
given
the
opportunity,
will
choose
to
sue
only
the
corporation
and
not
the
individuals.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
it's
not
clear
the
degree
to
which
congress
can
replace
bivens
liability.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
your
honor,
it
depends
on
how
you
read
bivens.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
court
op-
or
ac-
where
the
court
uses
its
discretion
to
do
that,
however,
the
court
must
be
particularly
cautious
about
it
so
that
it
does
not
usurp
the
role
of
congress
as
the
principal
creator
of
c-
of
causes
of
action
for
damages
under
the
constitution.
