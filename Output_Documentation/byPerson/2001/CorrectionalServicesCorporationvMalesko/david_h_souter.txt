have
to
abandon
that
because
the
the
concern,
a-
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
action
against
the
individual
has
a
more
significant
deterrent
effect
than
the
action
against
the
agency,
was
a
concern
that
was
expressed
in
the
context
of
dealing
with
a
public
agency.

that
argument
far
enough,
then
there
would
be
no
liability
at
all
because
we
know
that
if
we
hold,
for
example,
the
individual
liable,
there
is
going

be
a
tendency
there
to
shift
that
liability
either
by
insurance
or
by
respondeat
superior
and
insurance,
ultimately
to
the
cost
of
contracting.

you're
saying
that
this,
i
think
you're
saying
the
state
law
remedy
simply
doesn't
address
the
constitutional
violation.
