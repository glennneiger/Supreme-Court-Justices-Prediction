concession
holds,
if
the
employee
is
sued
for
a
wrongful
act,
under
state
law
would
it
be
permissible
in
your
view,
just
under
s-
standard
principles
of
derivative
liability,
to
hold
the
corporation
for
that
tort,
for
the
tort
of
its
own
employee?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
state
courts
could
do
that
without
interference
with
any
federal
policy
or
with
or
without
any
s-
super,
superseding
f-
federal
law
to
the
contrary.

just
doesn't
ring
true
to
me
that
there's
no
deterrence
by
holding
the
corporation
liable.

your

on

i

can't

anything
about

justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i-
is
it
clear
that
the
us-
employee
would
be
liable
under
state
law
in
light
of
boyle
versus
united
technologies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
since
mcknight
rejected
parallelism,
and
and
and
you
you
want
it.

a
a

could
a
could
a
state
just
incorporate
the
eighth
amendment
standard
as
a
matter
of
state
tort
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
state,
as
part
of
a
state
cause
of
action,
simply
e-
incorporate
the
eighth
amendment
as
part
of
a
state
tort
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
reckless
indifference
or
you're
you're
liable
under
state
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
don't
need
the
bivens
cause
of
action
even
even
for
the
eighth
amendment
because
states
are
free
to
enact
it
if
they
choose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
well
the,
you
have
no
authority
to
say
that
a
state
can
create
a
cause
of
action
against
a
federal
officer.
