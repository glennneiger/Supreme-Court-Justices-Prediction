mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
action
for
damages
under
bivens
should
be
applied
to
a
private
corporation
acting
under
color
of
federal
law.
like
many
cases,
where
you
come
out
on
a
case
like
this,
i
think
in
many
ways
depends
on
where
you
begin,
and
the
parties
have
put
forward
to
this
court
fundamentally
conflicting
paradigms
with
respect
to
the
best
way
to
analyze
bivens
based
on
this
court's
prior
decisions.
the
respondent
and
the
court
below
essentially
concluded
that
bivens
is
a
ubiquitous
remedy
that
ought,
generally,
to
be
available
in
order
to
maximize
recoveries
and
to
maximize,
or
at
least
optimize,
deterrent
values,
and
that
it
is
our
burden
essentially
to
try
to
ascertain
whether
there
might
be
some
conflicting
or
some
exception
to
the
bivens
doctrine
that
would
get
us
out
from
under
liability
in
the
in
this
particular
case.
[inaudible]
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the...
mr.
phillips,
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
w-
we
have
always
assumed,
from
the
first
day
of
this
li-
litigation,
that
a
bivens
action
would
lie
against...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
for
purposes
of
this
litigation
and
for
purposes
of
my
client,
there's
no
question
we
would
concede
that
the,
an
action
would
have
legitimately
been
br-
been
raised
against
them.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
mean
under
a
theory
of
respondeat...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
it's
going
to
depend
on
the
state.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
o-
obviously,
there's
going
to
be
at
least
a
potential
argument
raised
with
respect
to
boyle
and
whether
or
not
the
the
decision
to
hold
the
individual
liable
under
those
circumstances
is
preempted
under
boyle.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
you're
doing
an
extraordinary
amount,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
the
premise
of
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
is
where
the
where
the
mistake
lies
in
the
final
outcome
of
the
decision.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
the
question
ultimately
comes
down
to
this,
y-
y-
your
honor,
is
that
does
it
make
any
more
sense
in
this
context
to
resolve
this
issue
at
this
point
in
time
than
it
did
to
decide
the
fdic
versus
meyer
case
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
simply
answering
justice
kennedy
and
justice
o'connor's
question.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
not
giving
up
much
i-
in
that
regard.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
be
an
argument,
but
in
order
to
do
that,
justice
scalia,
you
would
then
have
to
abandon
what
was
one
of
the
principal
legs
of
bivens
in
the
first
instance,
which
is
that
the
litigation
against
the
private
individual
and
the
deterrent
value
of
litigation
against
the
private
individual
is
the
most
significant
way
to
achieve
the
overall
objectives...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
i
think
the
the
flaw
in
your
analysis
of
the
deterrence
theory,
justice
souter,
is
that
you're
looking
to
figure
out
what
is
sort
of
the
optimal
answer
for
deterrence.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
when
you
go
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me
you
then
assume
much
more
of
a
legislative
role.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well
ob-
ob-
we
don't
obviously,
we
don't
ask
the
court
to
overrule
bivens.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
three
points,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
where,
heretofore,
we
have
never
impo-
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
absolutely...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
i
you
can
construe
it
most
favorably
to
the
plaintiff,
but
not
necessarily
to
em-
embrace
a
complete
different
theory
of
the
case
that
does,
is
far
from
clear.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
for
purposes
of
where
the
case
is
right
at...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
think
on
remand,
obviously
we
would
fight
if
if
the
case
were
to
go
forward,
we
would
continue
to
fight
that
issue.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
will
be
a
preemption
issue
that's
going
to
immediately
arise
as
to...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
whether
he's
immune.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
your
honor.
