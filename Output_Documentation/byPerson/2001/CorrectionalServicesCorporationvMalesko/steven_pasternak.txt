mr.
steven
pasternak
[ns]
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
steven
pasternak
because
of
the
mentality
that
exists
as
far
as
the
corporation,
your
ho-
your
honor.
mr.
steven
pasternak
it
wouldn't
be
sufficient
because
the
employees
are
at-will
employees.
mr.
steven
pasternak
in
the
state
of
new
york,
they're
are
at-will
employees.
mr.
steven
pasternak
it
may
vary
from
state
to
state.
mr.
steven
pasternak
it's
possible
that
it
may
be.
mr.
steven
pasternak
getting
further
removed.
mr.
steven
pasternak
if
i
may
respond.
mr.
steven
pasternak
there's
not
a
whole
line
of
cases,
but
there
is
a,
there
are
cases,
your
honor,
that
have
to
be
addressed
as
far
as
either
a
federal
tort
claims
act
case
or
a
section
nineteen
eighty-three
as
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
amtrak,
for
instance
whether
it
would
be
acting
as
a
government
agent...
mr.
steven
pasternak
i
think
any
time
you're
dealing
with
a
corporation
as
apposed
[:
opposed]
to
a
government
agency,
there
are
different
things
that
come
into
play
as
far
as
what
their
motives
are.
mr.
steven
pasternak
that
is
what
our
fact...
mr.
steven
pasternak
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
pasternak
then
there
wouldn't
be
liability
for
the
violation
of
the
federal
constitution,
and
there
would
be
no
difference.
mr.
steven
pasternak
then
i-
u-
he
would
have
his
claim.
mr.
steven
pasternak
there
are
different
elements
as
far
as
what
was
pleading
i-
in
the
complaint.
mr.
steven
pasternak
not
pleaded
directly
as
a
policy,
no.
mr.
steven
pasternak
well,
i-
again,
we're
going
back
to
the
language
of
the
pro
se
complaint.
mr.
steven
pasternak
he
did
not
allege
it
as
a
policy
per
se.
mr.
steven
pasternak
he
did.
mr.
steven
pasternak
well,
there's
still
a
complaint
that
would
exist
wi-
i
mean,
there
is
a
possible
claim
as
far
as
the
ada
and
just
the
general
logic
of
housing
somebody
with
a
known
heart
condition
on
the
fifth
floor
where
he
would
be
susceptible
to
being
killed
in
the
event
of
a
fire.
mr.
steven
pasternak
i
would
argue
that
under
either
situation,
we
would
satisfy
the
requirement.
mr.
steven
pasternak
if
we're
looking
for
parallelism
between
the
two,
then
it
would
make
sense
to
have
the
monell
standard,
but
it
not
necessarily
has
to
follow
because
under
common
law,
we
would
have
the
respondeat
superior.
mr.
steven
pasternak
it
was
rejected
and
symmetry
is
difficult
to
achieve.
mr.
steven
pasternak
it
has
been
limited.
mr.
steven
pasternak
[inaudible]
mr.
steven
pasternak
oftentimes.
mr.
steven
pasternak
there
would
be
a
common
law
cause
of
action.
mr.
steven
pasternak
you
would
have
the
issue
as
far
as
normally
you
would
have
the
immunity
that
would
be
granted
under
the
state
law,
and
you
would
have
the
problems
in
that
direction.
mr.
steven
pasternak
since
we
are
dealing
with
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution,
we
would
submit
that
there
should
be
one
uniform
body
of
decision
coming
out
as
far
as
what
that
federal
law
should
be
and
how
it
should
be
interpreted,
that
we
should
not
be
subjected
to
the
vagaries
of
the
differences
in
the
various
states
as
to
their
rules
as
far
as
procedure,
discovery,
but
there
should
be
one
uni-
you-
yiel-
one
body
of
law
encompassing,
from
the
federal
side,
a
violation
of
a
federal
constitutional
right.
mr.
steven
pasternak
[ns]
in
mcknight,
the
argument
w-
with,
rej-
rejected
the
argument
of
boyle,
as
far
as
a
corporation
being
lia-
n-
not
being
liable
and
a
danger
as
far
as
the
public
fisc.
mr.
steven
pasternak
not
entirely,
but
we
are
seeking
to
have
the
parallelism
also
as
far
as
a
f-
rights
of
a
federal
prisoner
and
a
state
prisoner,
to
both
be
able
to
go
and
sue
the
corporation...
mr.
steven
pasternak
because
the
correctional
services
corporation
is
not
the
government.
mr.
steven
pasternak
yes,
but
what
i'm
looking
for
is
it
for
not
for
it
to
be
recognized
by
this
court
that
the
private
corporation,
just
like
the
state,
is
not
the
federal
government.
mr.
steven
pasternak
there
would
be
less
defenses
raised
as
far
as
a
private
individual.
mr.
steven
pasternak
possibly
more
adequate
but
still
inadequate
in
order
to
address
a
federal
constitutional
violation.
mr.
steven
pasternak
it
does
it
is
an
eighth
amendment,
but
it
is
not
cited.
mr.
steven
pasternak
well,
both
theories
would
be
applicable
as
far
as
being
the,
bringing
the
suit.
mr.
steven
pasternak
a
standard
which
we
submit
we
would
that
my
client,
in
filing
the
suit
pro
se,
s-
satisfied.
mr.
steven
pasternak
it
was
amended
only
for
the
purposes
of
na-
of
attempting
to
name
mr.
urena
as
a
defendant,
and
then
there
was
a
proposed
second
amended
complaint
which
would
be
naming
additional
defendants,
which
and
i
believe
al-
also
different
causes
of
actions,
but
that
was
denied...
mr.
steven
pasternak
my
appearance
came
after
the
time
period.
mr.
steven
pasternak
not
necessarily
so,
but
it
is
usually
the
case
that
happens.
mr.
steven
pasternak
but
no
one
is
ar-
respectfully,
no
one
is
arguing
that
there
could
not
be
a
theory
for
csc
to
be
liable
under
common
law,
respondeat
superior,
or
under
the
ada
or
any
other
theory
for
the
corporation
to
be
liable.
mr.
steven
pasternak
if
i
may,
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
comes
out
of
the
government,
because,
a,
you
have
the
insurance,
and
b,
if
the
rates
get
increased
to
the
company,
then
the
company
then
has
to
turn
around
and
bid
it
out
to
the
federal
government,
and
the
federal
government
can
turn
around
and
go
to
a
different
contractor.
mr.
steven
pasternak
he
would
be
subject
to
the...
mr.
steven
pasternak
well,
we
would
also
a-
anytime
an
insurance
company
is
setting
rates,
they're
going
to
be
looking
to
its
past
history
of
the
individual
applicant
to
ascertain
what
the
potential
is
and
what
programs
are
in
place
in
order
to
try
and
control
what
those
potential
dangers
are.
mr.
steven
pasternak
[ns]
as
far
as
amounts,
it's
difficult
to
quantify
as
to
what
it
is.
mr.
steven
pasternak
that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
pasternak
i
think
it
would
depend
on
how
a
jury
viewed...
mr.
steven
pasternak
that
would
be.
mr.
steven
pasternak
there
would
be
a
potential
under
certain
situations
under
state
law...
mr.
steven
pasternak
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
pasternak
i'm
sorry.
mr.
steven
pasternak
it
could.
mr.
steven
pasternak
but
that
would
leave
to
each
individual
state
to
ascertain
and
decide
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
remedy
that
exists
as
far
as
a
federal
constitutional
violation,
which
is
a
separate
and
distinct
harm
that
needs
to
be
addressed.
mr.
steven
pasternak
this
court
ha-
yes,
it
is.
mr.
steven
pasternak
in
here,
though,
where
we
have
a
private
corporation,
who
is
operating
pursuant
to
its
contract
with
the
government,
where
it
has
a
separate
motive,
a
fiduciary
duty
in
order
to
maximize
its
profits,
and
there
the
danger
to
the
federal
fisc
is
less,
we
submit,
or
certainly
no
greater
than
to
do
additional
bivens
situation,
we
would
submit
that
the
greatest
deterrence
that
could
exist
is
to
go
and
permit
the
suit
against
the
corporation
and
not
impose
the
duty
in
order
to
try
and
ascertain
which
employee
would
it
be,
whether
or
not
it's
a
former
employee
who
set
a
policy
who's
no
longer
there,
but
to
permit
it
because
it
is
the
corporation
who
has
control
of
its
individual
employees
based
on
the
relationship,
whether
it
be
for
a
limited
contract
and
what
contract
terms
are
or
whether
it
be
an
at-will
employee,
and
also
based
on
respondeat
superior,
that
we
need
to
recognize
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
private
corporation.
