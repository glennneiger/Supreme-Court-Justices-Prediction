mr.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
strictly
speaking,
mr.
phillips,
for
you
to
say
that
you're
making
a
concession
that
the
employee
i
mean,
that's
like
a
lawyer
representing
a
saying
he
concedes
b
would
be
liable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
nineteen
eighty-three,
too,
in
monell
we
rejected
the
idea
there
could
be
any
sort
of
respondeat
superior
liability.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lamken.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
generalize
that
the
employees
are
at-will
employees?
i
mean,
that
would
vary
perhaps
from
case
to
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're
deciding
a
case
not
just
on
the
basis
of
the
state
of
new
york,
but
maybe
in
some
other
states,
they
have
a
three
year
contract.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
pleaded
a-
as
a
policy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
not
pleaded
directly
as
a
policy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
pasternak,
compare
for
a
moment,
if
you
will,
the
elements
of
damages
you
would
be
seeking
under
the
kind
of
claim
you
have
in
mind
and
the
elements
of
damages
you
might
be
seeking
under
a
state
a
state
law
negligence
action
w-
as
as
to
amounts,
amounts
of
money.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i-
the
w-
what
you
want
as
a
result
of
the
claimed
violation
is
money
damages,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i'm
i'm
asking
you
would
the
money
damages
be
any
different
under,
i-
you
know,
under
a
theory
of
negligence
as
opposed
to
the
theory
you're
proposing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
i
i
realize
one
jury
can
give
you
one
result
and
one
another.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pasternak.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
is
no.
00-860
correctional
services
corporation
against
malesko.
correctional
services
corporation
has
a
contract
with
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
operate
a
facility
in
new
york
city
that
houses
federal
inmates.
the
respondent
is
a
former
federal
inmate
afflicted
with
a
heart
condition
limiting
his
ability
to
climb
stairs.
in
the
course
of
serving
a
prison
sentence
for
federal
security’s
fraud,
respondent
was
transferred
to
le
marquis
which
is
the
name
of
this
facility
where
he
was
assigned
a
bedroom
on
the
fifth
floor.
shortly,
after
his
arrival
there,
the
company
instituted
a
policy
requiring
inmates
residing
below
the
sixth
floor
to
use
the
stairs
rather
than
the
elevator.
our
respondent
was
exempted
from
this
policy
on
account
of
his
heart
condition,
but
when
a
csc
employee
forbade
respondent
to
use
the
elevator
to
reach
his
bedroom,
he
had
to
climb
the
stairs,
he
suffered
a
heart
attack
and
fell.
and
he
then
filed
an
action
for
money
damages
against
csc
the
corporation
which
the
district
court
dismissed.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court
and
allowed
the
respondent’s
suit
to
proceed
under
our
1971
decision
bivens
versus
six
unknown
federal
narcotics
agents.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reversed
that
decision.
in
bivens,
we
recognized
for
the
first
time
an
implied
private
action
for
money
damages
against
federal
officers
who
commit
unconstitutional
acts.
we
have
extended
this
holding
only
twice.
both
times
to
provide
a
cause
of
action
against
individual
officers
for
plaintiffs
who
lacked
an
alternative
remedy.
this
is
clearly
not
the
situation
here.
the
respondent
is
suing
an
entity,
not
an
individual
and
makes
this
case
quite
similar
to
our
recent
decision
in
fdic
versus
meyer
in
which
we
held
that
bivens
does
not
provide
a
cause
of
action
against
a
federal
agency
that
is
otherwise
amenable
to
sue.
we
confirmed
in
meyer
that
the
purpose
of
bivens
is
to
deter
unconstitutional
acts
of
individual
federal
officers
and
reasoned
that
the
deterrent
effects
of
the
bivens
remedy
would
be
lost
if
we
were
to
provide
a
parallel
action
against
the
individual’s
employer.
on
the
logic
of
meyer,
inferring
a
constitutional
tort
remedy
here
against
the
company
that
is
running
the
facility
in
new
york
it
seems
foreclosed.
second,
the
claimant’s
in
respondent’s
shoes
do
not
lack
alternative
remedies.
the
respondent
admits
that
alternative
remedies
such
as
a
tort
remedy
under
state
law
administrative
remedies
adopted
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
are
at
least
as
great
in
many
respects
greater
than
anything
that
bivens
might
provide.
finally,
no
federal
prisoner
whether
housed
in
a
private
or
public
facility
enjoys
respondent’s
contemplated
remedy.
inmates
housed
in
bop
facilities
may
sue
an
offending
individual
officer
for
money
damages
under
bivens,
but
no
right
of
action
lies
against
the
officer’s
employer,
the
bop
or
the
united
states.
whether
it
makes
sense
to
impose
asymmetrical
liability
cost
on
private
facilities
alone
is
a
question
thus
lasts
for
congress
to
decide.
justice
scalia

concurring
opinion
in
which

justice
stevens

a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
