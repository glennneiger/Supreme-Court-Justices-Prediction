justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
suppose
that
the
advice
that
you
have
a
right
to
decline
the
request
applies...
and
i...
i
take
it
you
could
read
bostick
this
way;
perhaps
you
disagree...
to
whether
or
not
the...
the
consent
was
actually
given
as
opposed
to
whether
there
was
a
coercive
environment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
i...
what...
i
don't
know
what
that...
why
should
that
make
a
difference.
if
somebody
shows
me
a
badge
and
he's
casually
dressed,
i
know
he's
got
a
gun,
or
he's
going
to
be
fired.
an
officer
is
fired
if
he
doesn't
carry
his
gun.
everybody
knows
that.
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
this.
would
it
be
appropriate
in
your
view
for
this
court
to
write
an
opinion
in
which
we
say
that
citizens
have
certain
obligations
to
know
their
rights
and
to
assert
their
rights?
that's
what
makes
for
a
strong
democracy.
the
law
lives
in
the
consciousness
of
the
people.
and
people
have
a
certain
obligation
to
assert
their
rights.
if
they
don't
want
to
be
searched,
they
say
i
don't
want
to
be
searched.
should
we
write
that
in
an
opinion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
proposition
as
i...
as
i've
stated
it?
because
if
you
say
yes...
and
i
think
there's
a
good
answer
for
it...
then
i'd
just
say,
well,
we
have
to
distinguish
miranda
at
least.
miranda
is
based
on
a
contrary
assumption.
that's
what's
running
through
my
mind
as
i'm
asking
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
assume
the
other
policy
objection
is,
the
underlying
premise
of
justice
breyer's
suggestion
is
the
government
has
some
obligation
to
teach
everybody
about
their
rights.
and
that's
a...
that's
a
sweeping
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
especially
when
it's
not
required
by
the
constitution.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
page
4
of
the
government's
brief--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
says,
do
you
mind
if
i
check
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
freedom-to-leave
test
actually
is...
is
more
beneficial
for
your
client.
everybody
knows
you're
not
free
to
leave
the
bus.
you'll
miss
the
bus.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
what
we
said
in
bostick.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
court
applied
a
higher
standard
than...
than
was
necessary
and
still
found
voluntary
search.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
want
us
to
reverse
because
there
was
a
test
that's
too
favorable
to
your
client?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--an
american
citizen
has
to
protect
his
rights
once
in
a
while.
that's...
that's
a
very
bad
thing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course.
the
right
to
say,
officer,
don't
bother
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
don't
read
bostick
that
way.
now,
this...
this
argument
that
because
the
first
person
is
arrested,
the
second
person
feels
coerced,
that
seems
to
me
it
goes
the
other
way
around.
the
second
person
now
knows
the
consequences
of
giving
consent.
under
your
theory,
the
first
person
is
arrested
and
the
second
person
says,
oh,
i...
i'd
like
to
be
arrested
too.
come
and
search
me.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that...
that
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
government
also
has
the
burden
to
educate
citizens
as
to
their
rights
in
every
encounter,
whether
or
not
there
isn't
some
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
citizen
to
know
and
to
exercise
his
rights
or
her
rights.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
you
want
people
to
travel
on
buses
where
people
might
have
weapons
and
drugs
and
can't
be
searched.
you
think
that's
better
for
passengers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the...
the
briefs
make
a
big
deal
about
the
fact
that
they
didn't
announce
that
everybody
on
the
bus
first...
a
general
announcement
what
was
going
to
happen.
i...
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
go
down
that
road
and
it'd
be
like
our
cases,
where
one
case
says
they
didn't
look
at
the
officer,
and
the
next
case
said
they
didn't
look
at
the...
i...
i
just
think
that's
equivocal.
i
think
you
can
argue
that
either
way.
and
you
go
on
for
15
pages
in...
in
your
brief
about
the...
the
police
chose
the...
the
locus,
the
bus
locus,
the
fact
that
they
were
close
to
the
passengers,
which
they
obviously
had
to
be
in
the
bus,
and...
and
talked
individually
to
each
passenger,
the
officer's
appearance
and
demeanor,
they
constructively
blocked
the
aisle,
they
presented
their
badges,
but
they
didn't
show
the
gun.
it...
it
seems
to
me
this
world
you're
creating
for
us
is...
is
not
strong
for
the
constitution.
it
seems
to
me
a
strong
world
is
when
officers
respect
people's
rights
and...
and
people
know
what
their
rights
are
and...
and
assert
their
rights.
i
don't
want
to
be
searched.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
want
to
be
searched.
leave
me
alone.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
a
criminal
case.
the
two
respondents,
drayton
and
brown,
were
arrested
and
convicted
for
possession
of
drugs.
the
police
found
the
drugs
after
conducting
a
patdown
search.
when
drayton
and
brown
were
passengers
on
a
bus
going
from
florida
to
detroit.
in
tallahassee,
three
tallahassee
police
officers,
with
the
driver’s
permission,
boarded
the
greyhound
bus
during
a
scheduled
stop.
one
officer
stayed
in
front
of
the
driver’s
seat
and
looked
backward,
the
second
officer
went
to
the
rear
and
looked
forward,
and
the
third
officer
worked
his
way
from
the
back
to
the
front
speaking
with
the
individual
passengers.
drayton
and
brown
were
seated
together.
when
the
officer
reached
them,
he
talked
to
brown
first
and
asked
whether
he
could
search
the
suitcase
on
the
overhead
rack.
there
are
many
details
in
these
opinions
and
we
cannot
summarize
them
all
here,
but
the
details
are
important
in
these
search
cases
and
the
event
that
went
on
with
reference
to
the
bag
has
some
significance.
but
in
any
event,
brown
agreed
and
a
search
of
the
bag
revealed
no
contraband.
the
officer
then
asked
brown
whether
he
could
check
brown’s
person,
and
brown
agreed.
the
patdown
search
revealed
objects
similar
to
drug
packages
on
brown’s
person.
they
were
strapped
it
appears
with
adhesive
taped
in
his
inner
thighs
under
his
clothing.
brown
was
arrested
and
taken
off
the
bus.
the
police
officer
returned
and
asked
drayton
for
drayton’s
consent
to
a
patdown,
drayton
gave
consent.
he
too
was
arrested
when
drugs
were
found
with
similar
packages
similarly
concealed.
the
statements
the
officer
made
to
the
passengers
are
important
and
as
vindicated
we
will
not
recount
every
detail
here.
suffusive
to
say
that
the
police
officer
identified
himself,
spoke
in
quite
tones
to
each
person
and
asked
for
permission
to
examine
the
baggage,
and
in
brown
and
drayton’s
case,
to
search
their
person.
he
did
not
however,
tell
the
passengers
they
had
a
right
to
refuse
to
give
consent.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction.
it
held
the
search
was
not
voluntary.
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals’
reversal
was
because
bus
passengers
do
not
feel
free
to
disregard
an
officer’s
request
to
search
in
circumstances
like
these
absent
some
positive
indication
that
the
consent
may
be
refused.
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
we
conclude
that
the
behavior
and
the
statements
of
the
officer
did
not
constitute
the
seizure
of
the
passengers
within
the
bus
or
of
drayton
and
brown
in
particular.
the
officer
gave
the
passengers
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
were
required
to
answer
questions.
the
officer
did
not
brandish
a
weapon
or
make
any
intimidating
movements;
he
left
the
isle
free
so
that
the
respondents
could
exit.
he
spoke
to
passengers
one
by
one
and
in
a
polite
quiet
voice,
nothing
he
said
would
suggest
to
a
reasonable
person
that
he
or
she
was
barred
from
leaving
the
bus
or
otherwise,
terminating
the
encounter.
under
our
precedents,
the
officer’s
display
of
his
badge
was
not
dispositive,
and
because
it
is
well-known
in
our
society
that
most
officers
are
armed,
the
presence
of
a
holstered
firearm
is
unlikely
to
be
coheresive
absent
act
of
brandishing
of
the
weapon.
that
one
officer
remained
in
the
front
of
the
bus
also
does
not
tip
the
scale
to
respondents
since
he
did
nothing
to
intimidate
the
passengers
and
said
or
did
nothing
to
suggest
the
people
could
exit.
what
i
have
said
before
relates
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
seizure.
in
addition
to
not
being
seized,
the
respondents
were
not
subjected
to
an
unreasonable
search.,
and
this
is
because
their
consent
to
the
search
was
voluntary.
whereas
here,
the
question
of
voluntariness
pervades
both
the
search
and
seizure
inquiries,
the
respective
analysis
turns
on
very
similar
facts.
officers
need
not
always
inform
citizens
of
their
right
to
refuse
when
seeking
permission
to
conduct
a
warrantless
consent
search.
in
a
society
based
on
law,
the
concept
of
agreement
and
consent
should
be
given
a
weight
and
dignity
of
its
own.
police
officers
act
in
full
accord
with
the
law
when
they
ask
citizens
for
consent,
and
it
reenforces
the
rule
of
law
for
the
citizen
to
advice
the
police
of
his
or
her
wishes,
and
for
the
police
to
act
in
reliance
on
that
understanding.
when
this
exchange
takes
place,
it
dispels
inferences
of
coercion.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
join.
