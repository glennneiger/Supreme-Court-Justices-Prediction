we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
01-631,
the
united
states
v.
christopher
drayton
and
clifton
brown.
mr.
thompson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
one
of
the
difficulties
with...
with
a
warning
is,
you
know,
miranda
was
supposed
to
be
a
bright
line
test
where,
you
know,
we
didn't
have
to
argue
about
anything.
well,
we
had
at
least
60
or
70
cases
here
deciding
whether
somebody
introduced...
was
interrogating
and
that
sort
of
thing.
so,
if
you
have
some
sort
of
a
requirement
like
that,
it's
just
another
layer
of
litigation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
thompson.
ms.
spivey,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
nuance
of
a
question,
do
you
mind
if
i
inspect
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
well,
is
there
any
doubt
that
this
person
answered
it
in
a
way
that
indicated
consent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's...
what's
indirect?
do
you
mind
if
i
check
your
person?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it...
it
turns
on
that
sort
of
a
subtle
distinction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
ask
for
findings...
did
you
ask
for
findings
that
were
that
detailed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
we...
we
should
accept
the
feel,
as
you
describe
it,
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--on
a
hot
day
in
february.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sell
to
the
court?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
the
testimony
showed
that
the
officer
leaned
over
from
the
back,
not
in
your
face.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
spivey.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
thompson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
thompson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-631
united
states
against
drayton
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
