stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
were
writing
on
a
blank
slate
and
other
cases
weren't
there,
what
would
be
the
department's
objections
to
a
rule
of
law
that
said
when
you're
on
a
bus,
only
11
inches
of
an
aisle,
three
people
get
on.
one
is
sitting
in
the
back
looking
over
the
crowd.
the
other
two
systematically
work
their
way
to
the
front.
what
would
be
the
objection
to
saying,
policeman,
of
course,
you
can
ask
citizens
to
cooperate?
certainly
that's
a
very
desirable
thing.
but
in
those
closed,
cramped
quarters
where
you
have
three,
just
say
you
don't
have
to
answer
if
you
don't
want
to.
you
don't
have
to
be
searched
if
you
don't
want
to,
making
clear
that
you're
eliciting
voluntary
cooperation
and
nobody
is
under
compulsion.
what
would
be
the
objection
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
might.
it
might
be
bad
policy.
and
my
question
was
are
there
policy
objections
to...
i'm
not
saying
what
the
constitutional
rule
is.
i
understand
those
arguments.
i'm
just,
for
my
own
benefit,
trying
to
find
out
if
that
would
cause
a
practical
problem
or
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that...
that
i
think
is
true,
but
could...
if
their
point
is
that
if...
if
you
were
to
take
your
case,
this
case
before
us,
and
say
under
the
present
law
and
the
test
that
you're
enunciating,
that
you
do
have
to
tell
the
passengers
what
i
suggested
earlier...
tell
them
they
don't
have
to
answer
or
respond...
well,
then
you'd
have
to
in
every
case.
so,
why
don't
you
give
me
an
example
of
one
where
they
wouldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
on
a
bus.
could
you
possibly
do...
because
actually
oddly
enough
bostick
is
about
buses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
there...
it's
about
buses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
buses
are
stopped
and
somebody
comes
on.
all
right.
so,
what
is...
can
you
think
of
any
example
in
those
circumstances
where
they
wouldn't
have
to
make
that
announcement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
we
do,
then
don't
we
have
to
follow
the
district
court?
i
mean,
the
district
court
there
concluded
in
the
facts
that
everything
was
cooperative,
there
was
nothing
coercive,
there
was
nothing
confrontational.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he
heard
the
officer
and
he
heard
the
tone
of
voice.
so,
how...
how
could
we
possibly
get
around
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
apparently
the
opposite--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
isn't
that
the
opposite
of
what
the
district
court
thought--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--who
saw
all
this?
i
mean,
the
district
court
heard
the
witnesses.
he
heard
the
tone
of
voice.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
to
get
very
far
with
this
notion
of
the
question.
what
about
the
other
two
things?
was
this
a
case
where
the
passengers
knew
that
the
bags
were
being
matched?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i...
i
see
it.
what
about...
but
was
this
a
case
where
the...
where...
was
this
a
case
where
the
passengers
knew
that
the
bags
were
being
matched?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
know
what
you
meant
then
by
bags
being
matched.
i
thought
you
meant
that
they
went
outside
or
did
something.
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you...
you
think
that
the
police
should
have
asked
them...
told
the
people
in
the
bus
you're
free
to
leave.
that's
basically...
would
that
make
it
all
right
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
what...
what...
is
it
that
the
police
in
your
opinion
can't
search
anyone
in
the
bus?
period?
what...
what
is
your
view
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i'm
trying
to...
i'm
sorry.
i
misspoke.
your...
your
view
is
that
they
should
have
told
the
passengers
explicitly
in
a
strong
way
you
do
not
have
to
cooperate
if
you
don't
want
to.
is
that...
is
that
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
i'm
trying
to
look
at
what
to
do.
i'm...
i'm
not...
suppose
i
think
for
argument's
sake
in
many
circumstances
where
policemen
come
up
and
question
people,
even
if
they
say
politely,
are
you
willing
to
answer
my
questions
or
be
searched,
the
person
feels
coerced.
but
the
law
still
tries
to
draw
a
line
even
if
that's
fictional
in
reality.
very
well.
what's
the
right
line?
i
mean,
are
buses
special?
what
is
it
that's
supposed
to
be
done?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
elicit
from
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
problem,
of
course,
is
i
think
if
you
go
with
an
all-facts
test,
you've
got
to
go
with
the
district
court.
he
saw
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't.
and
that's
why
i've
been
wondering
if
maybe
there's
something
inherently
coercive
about
the
bus
environment
that
suggests
a...
a
need
for
a
warning.
but
you
don't
agree
with
that
and...
and
therefore
i'm
sort
of
stuck.
and
there
we
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
that's
what
i
was
wondering
because
today
people
might
think
if
you're
on
a
airport
and
you
don't
go
through
the
detector,
you
don't
fly.
well,
they
might
think
that
if
you
don't
answer
the
questions,
you
don't
go--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
the
bus.
and...
and...
so
maybe
there's
more
need
now
for
something.
