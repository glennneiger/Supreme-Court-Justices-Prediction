mr.
thompson,
isn't
it
so
that
in
bostick
the
police
did
inform
the
passengers
that
they
had
a
right
to
refuse
consent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question,
mr.
thompson,
was
your
opening
statement
was
that
the
eleventh
circuit
had
ruled
in
direct
conflict
with
this
court's
precedent.
if
we're
applying
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
that's
one
circumstance
that
was
present
there,
is
not
present
here.
so,
whether
the
eleventh
circuit
erred
is
for
us
to
determine
today,
but
i
do
think
it's
a
bit
much
to
say
that
they...
they
just
disregarded
this
court's
precedent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
he
have
his
badge?
the
other
two
showed
their
badges.
did
the
one
in
the
front
show--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
any
other
case
that
we
considered
involve
a
body
pat-down,
not
just
a
request
to
look
at
luggage?
this...
in
this
case
the...
the
luggage
didn't
turn
up
anything
of
interest
to
the
police,
but
the
pat-down
did.
and
the
image
of
let's
take
what
is...
mr.
drayton
is
sitting
next
to
a
man
who
has
just
been
hauled
off
the
bus,
handcuffed.
i
imagine
he
would
feel
some
intimidation
at
that
point
when
the
police
then
turned
to
him
and
said,
okay,
we'd
like
to
search
you
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
drayton
said
nothing
throughout
the
whole
encounter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
thompson,
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
were
about
to
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the
police...
you
were
about
to
say
when
the
police
go
over
the
line.
i
think
you
said
here
they
did
nothing
that
would
imply
that
consent
or
that...
that
the
search
was
required
of
the
citizen.
what...
can...
can
you
give
a
description
of
when
the
police
would
step
over
the
line?
is
it...
must
the
police
give
words
of
command,
get
up,
i
want
to
search
you?
is
that...
does
it
take
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
far
as
drayton
is
concerned,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
other
than
that
he
lifted
his
hands
from
his
lap.
is
there...
he
didn't
utter
any
words,
and
so
his
consent
rides
on
that
gesture
and
what
it
meant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
eleventh
circuit
have
any
rule
about
using
its
unpublished
opinions
for
any
purpose
other
than
preclusion
in
a
particular
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
only
testimony
was...
officer
lang
was
the
only
one.
he
was
one
of
the
three.
he
was
one
of
the
two
questioners.
he's
the
only
one
who
testified
in
the
district
court.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think...
you
haven't
said
anything
about
the
difference
between,
say,
a
bus
terminal
or
a
street
where
when
the
police
say
whatever...
you...
you
are
in
a
large
space.
there
is
something
different
about
a
bus
and...
or
the
airplane
cabin
where
you...
you
are
rather
confined
compared
to
being
stopped
in
the
street.
