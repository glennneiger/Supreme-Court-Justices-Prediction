mr.
larry
d.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
held
in
several
decisions
that
the
police
questioning
of
individuals
is
a
legitimate
and,
indeed,
vital
law
enforcement
technique.
the
decision
below
ignores
this
court's
teachings
as
to
when
a
police-citizen
encounter
on
a
bus
may
violate
the
fourth
amendment
and
may
constitute
the
seizure
of
the
passenger.
police-citizen
encounters
have
proven
to
be
effective
law
enforcement
techniques
in
the
area
of
drug
and
weapon
interdiction.
these
encounters
are
also
important
in
today's
environment
with
respect
to
the
protection
of
passengers
in
the
nation's
public
transportation
system.
this
case
is
controlled
by
this
court's
decision
in
bostick
and
the
court
below
incorrectly
applied
the
bostick
test
to
these
facts.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
also
in
bostick
this
court
clearly
pointed
out,
on
remand
to
the
florida
supreme
court,
the
factors
that
the
court
should
evaluate
in
terms
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
encounter
was
coercive
or
otherwise
inappropriate.
and
two
of
those
factors
are
important
here
that
would
put
into
context
what
the
court
below
considered.
for
example,
this
court
pointed
out
to
the
florida
supreme
court
whether
or
not
there
were
guns
pointed
and
noted
that
there
were
no
guns
pointed
in
a...
in
the
bostick
case.
this
court
also
pointed
out
to
the
florida
supreme
court
that...
whether
or
not
there
was
the
existence
of
threatening
language,
and
none
of
that
existed
in
the
case
below.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
as
the
bostick
court
pointed
out
with
respect
to
the
test
to
be
applied
is
whether
or
not,
under
all
the
circumstances,
the
police
conduct
communicated
to
a
reasonable
person...
and
that
presupposes
a
reasonably...
a
reasonable
innocent
person...
whether
or
not
the
passenger
could
have
refused
the
officer's
request
to
consent
or
otherwise
have
terminated
the...
terminated
the
encounter.
there
is
really
nothing
remarkable
about
the
facts
of
this
case
when
you
look
at
this
court's
decision
in
bostick
and
compare
bostick
with
this
court's
decision
in
robinette
which
clearly
pointed--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--your
honor,
the
eleventh
circuit
considered
factors
that
were
unlike
the
factors
that
this
court
in
bostick
believed
were
important
in
determining
whether
the
police
conduct
at
issue
was
coercive.
and
moreover,
your
honor,
the
eleventh
circuit
incorrectly
applied
the
legal
principles
that
this
court
formulated
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
for
example,
the
eleventh
circuit
noted
the
importance
of
officer
hoover
at
the
front
of
the
bus
and
pointed
out
that
his
presence
might
lead
a...
a
passenger
to
believe
that
he
or
she
could
not
leave
the
bus.
well,
this
court
in
bostick
clearly
pointed
out
that
the...
in
a...
in
the
context
of
a
bus
interdiction
effort,
whether
or
not
the
passenger
could
leave
the
bus
was
the
wrong
question.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
passenger...
whether
or
not
the
police
conduct
communicated
to
the
passenger
whether
or
not
they
could
refuse
the
consent
requested
or
whether
or
not
they
could
just
terminate
the
questioning
of
the
police
officer.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
that...
it
is
one
relevant
fact
to
be
taken
into
consideration
with
the
other
factors,
but
here
the
officer
stationed
at
the
front
of
the
bus...
at
the
front
of
the
bus
really
did
not
communicate,
nor
did
officer
lang
who
was
doing
the
questioning...
did
not
communicate
that...
to
any
passenger
that
he
or
she
could
not
terminate
the
questioning.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
your
honor--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--excuse
me.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
your
honor,
not
in
this
case.
the
court
below
and
the
eleventh
circuit
acknowledged
in...
in
their
findings,
if
you
will,
that
the...
the
aisle
was
not
blocked,
the
exit
was
not
blocked.
in
fact,
every--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--your
honor,
the
presence
of
the
officer
at
the
front
of
the
bus
is
a
factor,
but
in
the
context
of
these
facts
and
if...
in
the
context
of
this
court's
decision
in
delgado
where
you
had
armed
agents
surrounding
the
factory,
and
this
court
held
that
simply
because
the
factory
workers
could
not
leave
without
passing
those
agents--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--it's
a
relevant
fact,
but
the
factors
to
be
considered
and
the
factors
that
this
court
clearly
announced
in...
in
the
bostick
case
were
factors
that
were
threatening,
factors
that
were
otherwise
coercive,
like
pointing
a
gun.
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
the
eleventh
circuit
even
noted
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
any
of
the
passengers
saw
that
this
officer
was
armed.
the
officers
were--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--the
officer
was
conducting
individual
passenger-specific
questioning.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
he
was
casually
dressed,
your
honor,
and
it's
not
clear
from
the
record
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
a
police
officer.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
i
don't
believe
the
record
is
clear
as
to
where
the
badge
was
located
with
respect
to
the
officer
at
the
front
of
the
bus.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
yes.
they
all
entered
as
passengers,
all
casually
dressed.
and
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
this...
of
this
search--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--well,
that
follows
on
with
the...
the
clear
test
that
this
court
announced
in
bostick,
and
the
test
was,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
the
police
conduct
commuted
anything...
communicated
anything
to
the
citizens
and
these
passengers
as
to--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--well,
here...
here
the...
the
citizens...
some
citizens
did
refuse
officer
lang's
request,
and
what...
what
you
posit
is...
is
really
the
guts
of
what
is
going
on
here.
as
officer
lang
testified,
your
honor,
many
of
the
citizens...
most
citizens
went
along
with
the
police
questioning
in...
in
this
particular...
these
particular
bus
interdictions,
and
they...
and
they
were
happy
to
do
so.
officer
lang
testified
that
many
of
the
bus
passengers
appreciated
his
efforts
in
coming
onto
the
bus.
they...
it
made
them
feel
a
sense
of...
of
safety.
and
here
citizens
generally
do
know
their
rights,
and
here
the
police
did
not
communicate
anything
to
these
passengers
that
would
indicate
that
they
had
to
answer,
that
they
were
required
or
otherwise
compelled
to
answer
officer
lang's
questions.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
well,
the...
the
bostick
test
presupposes
a
reasonable,
innocent
person.
in
this
particular
case,
mr....
mr.
brown's
consent
was
unambiguous.
he
opened
his
coat.
he...
in
response
to
the
question,
he
said,
sure.
he
took
out
a
cell
phone.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
drayton's...
drayton's
consent,
as
the
district
court
found,
was
clear
and
unambiguous.
he
raised
his
hands
off
of
his
thighs,
your
honor.
there
was
nothing
that
officer
lang
said
to
mr....
or
said
to
mr.
drayton
or
had
said
to
mr.
brown
that
would
have
indicated
that
mr.
drayton
could
not
have
terminated
the
questioning
or
that
he
could
have
refused
consent.
and
as
this
court
noted...
as
this
court
noted
in
bostick,
the
fact
that
a
lawbreaker
knows
that
the
search
is
going
to
uncover
contraband
or
is...
knows
that
the
search
is
going
to
uncover
drugs
does
not
make
the
consent
involuntary.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
you
have
the
facts,
but
your
conclusion,
your
honor,
i
would
differ
with
because
in...
in
the
situation
both
individuals
pointed
to
the
bag.
there
was
nothing
in
officer
lang's
request
to
mr.
brown
that
would...
that
would...
that...
that
would
send
or
communicate
to
mr.
brown
that
he
could
not
have
refused
the
request.
there
was
nothing
in
officer
lang's
question
that
would
indicate
to
mr.
brown
that
he
could
not
have
otherwise
terminated
the
questioning.
why
some
of
the--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--the
nature...
the
nature
of
the
search
is
not
necessary
to
the
bostick
inquiry.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
no,
your
honor.
you
have...
again,
you
have
to
understand
this
court's
holding
in
bostick
and
that
is
the--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--yes,
your
honor.
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
reasonable
person,
as
this
court
said,
presupposes
a
reasonable,
innocent
person.
lawbreakers
sometimes
agree
to
be...
agree
to
be
searched,
knowing
that
the
drugs
are
in
their
luggage
or
on
their
person,
for
a
number
of
reasons,
sometimes
as...
as
these
gentlemen
did.
they
want
to
be
cooperative.
they
do
not
want
to
send
some
kind
of
message
that
they
indeed
have
the
items
in
question.
they
want
to
appear
innocent.
they
do
this
for
any
number
of
reasons,
hoping
that
the
police
officer
will
not
search
them
and
go
away.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
it
has
nothing
to
do
with--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--compulsion.
excuse
me.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
the...
if...
if
the
police
would
communicate
to
the
citizen
somehow
that
the
citizen's
response
was
compelled.
for
example,
in...
in
bostick
this
court
noted
that
pointing
guns,
drawn
guns
would
lead
to
that...
that
kind
of
compulsion
or
coercion.
for
example,
if
the
police
used
threatening
language.
if
the
police
communicated
to
the
reasonable
person
that
he
or
she
could
not
refuse
the
request
for
consent
or
could
not
otherwise
terminate
the
questioning.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
absolutely.
here
you
have
unstructured,
rapidly
developing
police-citizen
encounters,
and
what
is
important
here--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
this
is
a
seizure
case,
your
honor.
that's
the...
the
court
below
decided
this
case
under
the...
under
the
bostick
test.
both
parties
before
the
eleventh
circuit
urged
the
bostick
test,
and
this
is...
i
would
submit
that
this
is
a
seizure
case.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
if
there
was
no
seizure?
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
it...
in
this
court's
test
in
bostick,
the
court
merged
the
voluntary
issue
and
the
voluntariness
in
with
the...
in
with
the
bostick
seizure
analysis.
so,
i
would
say
that...
that
the
two
are
merged
together
and
are
related.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
it's...
it's
hard
to...
in
the
context
of
these
bus...
police-citizen
encounters
on
a
bus,
it's
hard
to
really
see
the
distinction
between
the
voluntariness
test
and
the
seizure
test.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
i...
i
would
posit
here
that
we
do
not
really
need
in
this
particular
case
to...
to
understand
the
full
extent
of
the
scope
of
the
voluntariness
test
because
the
court
below
clearly
decided
this
case
under
bostick
and
as
a
seizure
case.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
the
person,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
well,
as
this
court
noted
in
bostick,
your
honor,
just
because
the
police-citizen
encounter
happens
on
a
bus,
there's
no
reason
to
establish
some
kind
of
per
se
rule.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
i...
i
don't
know--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--i
would...
i
would
say,
your
honor,
here
that--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--i
can
think
of
three
reasons.
your
honor,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
we...
you
do
not
want
to
saddle
law
enforcement
officers
with
some
kind
of
bright
line
test
in
fourth
amendment
cases.
that's
very
important
here
when
i
would
submit
that
bostick
is
an
appropriate
vehicle
to
determine
the
validity
of
consent.
in
these
particular
cases,
it's...
it's
very
difficult.
you
have
an
unstructured,
rapidly
evolving
and
developing
situation,
and
warnings
would
not
be--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
a
case
that
was
cited
in
the
government's
brief,
united
states
v.
stephens,
where
there
was
some
appropriate
warning,
and
the
court...
the
ninth
circuit
in
that
particular
case
said
that
the
warning
confused
the
passengers,
intimidated
the
passengers.
but--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--i
would
agree.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
i
would
agree,
justice--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--it
is
not
relevant,
your
honor.
some
people
did
say
no.
most
people--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--well,
your
honor,
as
this
court...
as
this
court
held
in
delgado,
simply
because
most
citizens
cooperate
and
most
citizens
agree
with
the
officer's
request,
that's
no
indication
that
the
consent
at
issue
is
involuntary.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
your
honor,
i
have
a
couple
points.
there
was
nothing
in...
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that
the
bus
was
in
fact
delayed.
on
the...
on
the
consent
point,
the
district
court
specifically
held
that
the
defendants
consented
after
hearing
the
evidence
at
the...
at
the
suppression
hearing.
and
the
respondents
were
not
naive
individuals
or
unable
to
understand
or
assert
their...
their
rights.
respondent
drayton
was
26.
he
was
employed
for
6
of
the
last
8
years,
and
he
had
experience
in
dealing
with
previous
drug
charges.
respondent
brown
was
29
and
had
been
a...
a
corrections
officer.
and
the
point
with
respect
to
justice
breyer's
question.
your
honor,
buses,
as...
as
the
government
pointed
out
in
its
reply
brief,
buses
today
in
today's
environment
are
vulnerable.
they
are
vulnerable
to
specific
public
safety
concerns,
and
the
government
would
submit
that
bus
passengers
are
entitled
to
the
kind
of
efficient,
effective,
and
fair
bus
interdiction
efforts
that
are...
that
characterize--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--no,
they
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
we
do
not--
mr.
larry
d.
thompson
--we...
we
do
not
have
that
specific
kind
of
program,
and
certainly
that
was
not
the...
the
reason
relied
upon
for
the
consent
in...
in
the
record
below.
but
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
officer
lang
testified
that
not
only
did
most
of
the
passengers
that
he
encountered
consent,
but
of
them
appreciated
what
he
was
doing.
it
gave
them
a
sense
of
comfort.
it
made
them
feel
that
their
bus
travel
was
safe.
and
that
would
be
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
here.
and
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
