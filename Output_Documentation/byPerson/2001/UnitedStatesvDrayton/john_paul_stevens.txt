justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
thompson,
do
you
regard
this
primarily
as
a
seizure
case
or
a
search
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
always
would
follow
if
you
concluded
that
there
was
no
seizure,
that
there
was
necessarily
voluntary
consent
to
the
search?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
analytically
they
have
to
be.
it
seems
to
me
you
could
have
a
case
in
which
you
could...
the
officer
could
say
to
the
man,
you're
perfectly
free
to
get
off
the
bus
anytime
you
want
to,
but
i'd
like
to...
to
search
you
first,
and
may
i
do
so?
and
then
the
question
would
be
whether
the
search
was
voluntary
even
if
there
had
been
no
seizure.
it
seems
to
me
that
could
be
a
scenario
that
would
make
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
does
seem
to
me
the
passenger
might
have
two
different
thoughts.
one,
i
better
not
get
off
the
bus.
i
want
to
get
to
columbus
or
cleveland
or
wherever
we're
going.
so,
i...
that...
maybe
i
can
get
off
the
bus,
but
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
but
that's
one
inquiry.
the
second
inquiry
is,
do
i
want
to
let
this
fellow
search
me?
it
seems
to
me
they
are
really
two
separate
questions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
what
significance,
if
any...
i
don't
know
if
it's
significant
or
not...
do
you
attach
to
the
fact
that,
as
i
understand
it
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
that
this
officer
had
made
similar
requests
several
hundred
times
and
only
five
or
six
people
had
ever
said
no?
is
that
relevant
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
that
suggests
that
perhaps
most
people
thought
they
had
an
obligation
to
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
i
keep...
perhaps
this
is
sort
of
strange.
but
if
the
police
made
it
perfectly
clear
to
everyone
that
they...
in
the
bus
that
there
will
be
no
adverse
consequences
whatsoever
if
you
refuse
to
let
me
search
your...
your
luggage,
why
would
anyone
let
them
search?
why--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
other
words,
i
want
to
look
through
your
luggage.
why
would
you
say
yes?
if
you
know
there
can
be
no
adverse
consequences,
it
seems
to
me
they
would
never
be
able
to
search
anybody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
the
cooperation?
we're
going
to
let
you
find
out
that
i
don't
have
guns
and
drugs
in
my...
i
know
i
don't
have
guns
and
drugs
in
my
luggage.
so,
why
should...
don't...
don't
bother
me.
i
don't
want
you
to
search
me.
i
don't
see
why
anyone
would
ever
consent
if
they
knew
it
was
totally
risk-free.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
passengers
on
the
buses
go
through
the
same
kind
of
check
that
we
do
on
airlines?
