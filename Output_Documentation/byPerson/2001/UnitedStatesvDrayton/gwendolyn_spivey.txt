ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
should
reaffirm
bostick
in
its
entirety.
we
are
not
arguing
that
advice
should
be
required.
rather,
we
think
that
bostick
got
it
entirely
right
with
the
language
that
advice
is
a
factor
particularly
worth
noting.
if
bostick
is
revised,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals,
as
it
did
in
bostick,
so
that
it
can
reconsider.
i
believe
the
key
to
this
test...
and
i
don't
mean
to
sound
presumptuous.
having
thought
long
and
hard,
i
think
the
key
is
that
the
eleventh
circuit
really
was
trying
to
give
voice
to
the
seizure
or...
and
the
consent
test,
as
set
out
in
bostick.
in
bostick
at
u.s.
437,
the
court
wrote...
it
focused
on
what
the
police
conduct...
conduct
would
have
communicated
to
a
reasonable
person.
and
in
washington
at
1357
and
guapi
at
1395,
what
the
eleventh
circuit
focused
on...
it
said,
it
is
enough
that
the
circumstances
themselves
would
indicate
that
the
search
can
proceed
only
if
consent
is
given.
so,
i
believe
that
the
eleventh
circuit
parallels
bostick's
use
of
the
word...
that
focused
on
what
does
it
communicate
with
their
use
of
the
word
indicate.
and
indicate
necessarily
refers
back
to...
it
expressly
refers
back
to
the
circumstances,
which
is
the
totality.
and
while
courts
tend
to
focus
most
commonly
on
whether
or
not
advice
was
given
or
not
given,
i
think
there
are
any
number
of
acts
or
omissions
that
focus
on
the
police
conduct--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--yes,
sir.
i
would...
i
would
posit
a...
a...
i
could
posit
a
scenario,
and
the
best
one
i
thought
of
is
that
that
we've
all
flown
on
airplanes
and--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--yes,
sir.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
yes,
sir.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
yes,
sir.
in
a...
besides
referring
to
the
specific
factors
here
and
suggesting
that
the
police
conduct
ratchet
down
the
coerciveness
of
any
factor,
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
police
did
not
delay
the...
the
departure
of
the
bus,
did
not
engage
in
bag-matching,
and
did
not
do
any
more
than
a...
a
flight
attendant
does
standing
in
the
aisle
and
talking
individually
to
the
passenger
and
does
not
use
language
that
would
communicate
to
a
reasonable,
innocent
person
that
cooperation
is
required...
for
example,
using
language
that
it's
voluntary.
they
could
use
language
that
it's
voluntary.
they
could
say,
are
you
willing,
with
your
permission.
or
specifically
in
this
case,
relating
to
mr.
drayton,
they
could
engage
in
acts.
for
example,
when
you
ask--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--they
used--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--respectfully,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
it
was
very
clear
that
what
they
were
asking
for
was
cooperation.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
they
immediately
approached
each
individual
passenger--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--and
said,
i'm
officer
so
and
so.
i'm
doing
this.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
do
you
have
a
bag
on
the
bus?
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
i
believe
that
point
right
there
denied
the
bostick
right
to
refuse
to
engage
with
the
officer.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
no.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
then
they
asked
another
question.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
do
you
mind--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--do
you
mind
if
i
check
it?
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
no,
justice
scalia.
in
schneckloth
at
u.s.
229,
this
court
referred
to
the,
quote,
subtly
coercive
police
questions.
and
i
think
one
really
does
have
to
look
at
the
nuances
of
the
questions
and
how
a
reasonable,
innocent
person
would
take
them.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
because
i
think
no
matter
how
a
reasonable,
innocent
person
answers
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
police
can
construe
it
as
consent.
if
they
say--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
there
is
doubt
because
i
believe...
not
as
to
the
bag,
but
as
to
the
question,
do
you
mind
if
i
check
your
person.
i
do
believe
there's
definitely
doubt
because
of
the
indirect
question
and
also
because
of
his--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--because
no
matter
whether
you
answer
it
yes
or
no,
it's
not
may
i
check
your
person.
if
you
say
no,
it
means
no.
yes
means
yes.
but
if
you
say,
do
you
mind
if
i,
if
the
person
says
yes--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--i
think
it
can,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
one
factor--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--yes,
sir.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
well,
justice
breyer,
the
district
court
applied
the
wrong
test.
it
applied
the
free-to-leave
test.
that...
that's
at
the
joint
appendix
at
132,
and
that's
specifically
what
this
court
rejected
in
bostick
the
florida
supreme
court
had
done.
he
also...
i
disagree
with
the
government's
representation
that
he
said
that
mr.
drayton
was
clear
or
unambiguous.
he
did
not
address...
he
did
not
make
any
factual
findings
as
to
the
actual
encounter.
and--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--well,
justice
kennedy,
from
my
perspective,
the
important
point
is
that
he
applied
the
wrong
test,
the
test
this
court
has
rejected.
and
also,
he
made
two
other
legal--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--no.
i...
i
have
no...
i
have
no
objection
with
the
bostick
test,
either
the
test
for
seizure
at
u.s.
437
or
the
test
for
consent
at
u.s.
438.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
then
applied
the
correct
test
and
overturned
the...
the
legal
conclusion
which
the
district
court
reached.
the
district
court
said
that...
he
made
a
global
conclusion.
he
said,
quote,
their
consent
leads
me
to
believe
there
was
no
violation.
well,
i
think
that,
with
all
respect,
is
a
tautology.
just
because
they
consent,
it
doesn't
mean
there's
no
violation.
and
i
think
that...
he
said--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
justice
scalia--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--no,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
agree
with
the
first
part
of
the
question
because
the
district
court
made
no
findings
whatsoever
regarding
the
specifics
of
the
actual
encounter
or
exchange
between
the...
the
defendants
and
the...
or
the
police
officers
and
individual
passengers.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
the
trial...
neither
trial
counsel
for
the
government
nor
the
defense
did,
your
honor.
but
the
district
court
then
said
there's
nothing
coercive
about
this
encounter,
and
i
believe
that's
an
ultimate
legal
conclusion
which,
when
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
correct
test
from
bostick,
reached
the
correct
result.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
yes.
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
correct.
and
i
think
it's
clear
under
schneckloth
and
bumper
that
mere
acquiescence...
and
that
was...
is
not
sufficient.
and
that's
why
i
was
saying
i
think
that
the
police
conduct
can
be
either
acts
or...
and/or
omissions.
and
i
think
the
omission
here
or
the
act
here
was
simply
not
waiting
on
an
answer.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
i
think
that's
a
classic
example,
your
honor...
after
you've
just
watched
the
other
passenger
arrested
and
hauled
across
the
top
of
you,
that's
a
classic
example
of
mere
acquiescence
to
a
show
of
authority.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
the
district--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--justice
breyer,
in
response
to
your
first
question,
the
district
court
never
addressed
the
specifics
of
mr.
drayton's
nonverbal
response--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--i
think
it
was
very
clear.
i
don't
think
a
reasonable
person
sitting
in
that
bus,
unless
they
were
deaf,
could
not
have
known
that
the
bags...
they
were
asking
every
person,
do
you...
as
the
first
question.
do
you
have
a
bag?
if
they
did,
may
i
check
it.
in
fact,
officer
lang--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--no,
your
honor.
the
carry-on
luggage,
which
this
court,
you
know,
focused
on
in
bond,
the
privacy
of
that
carry-on
luggage.
i
believe
that
the
government...
the
officer
used
that
as
a
means
of
basically
forcing
an
encounter
by
asking
a
person,
do
you
have
a
bag.
and
stephens
pointed
out
the
hobson's
choice
that
a
passenger
faces.
they
don't...
it...
it
denies
their
right
to
ignore
the
officer
because
if
they
say
nothing,
the
bag
is
construed
as
abandoned.
you
have
to
respond
to
the
officer.
so,
i
think
bostick
gives
you
the
right
to
ignore--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--i
think
the
bostick,
justice
kennedy,
gave
citizens,
bus
passengers,
the
right
to
ignore
officers.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
but
that's
not
ignoring
them,
your
honor.
that's
having
to
engage
with
them,
and
i
think
that's
part
of
the
technique
that's
used,
is
getting
a
person...
if
you
can
get
them
to--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--i
don't
think--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--i
don't
think
a
reasonable,
innocent
person
would
take
what
happened
to...
to
a
passenger
sitting
next
to
him
as
anything
but
a
classic
example
of
a
show
of
authority.
in...
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
kennedy,
to
the
government
earlier,
i
think
that
putting
the
burden
on
the
citizen
shifts
the...
the
burden
is
on
the
government
in
every
case
to
prove
that
the
encounter
is
consensual
and
that
any
consent
given
is
voluntary
and
is
uncoerced.
and
i
think--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that
that
ignores
the
demographic
realities
of
the
reasonable
bus
passenger.
the
government
acknowledged
below
that
most
bus
passengers
are
economically
disadvantaged,
and
they
don't
know
who
their
congressman
is
or
the
governor.
they
don't...
that
was
not
acknowledged
below.
i
don't
mean--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--certainly
not,
your
honor.
certainly
not,
but
i
think
there
is
a
limit
to
the
imposition
on
millions
of
innocent
people
for
the
purpose
of
ferreting
out
ordinary
criminal
wrongdoing.
and
to
the
extent
that
the...
the
departure
of
this
bus
was
delayed,
i
think
this
case
is
right
on
point
with
the
edmund
case.
to
the
extent
they
delayed
the
forward
movement
of
that
bus,
i
believe
every
passenger
on
it
was
seized
even
though
i
disagree
that
the
court
below
addressed
the
seizure
issue.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
they
knew
that
they
were
seated
next
to
each
other
in
a
seat.
there
was
no
testimony
whatsoever...
there
was
testimony
that
the
officer
had
seen
the
respondents
in...
depending
on
which
transcript
we're
looking
at.
there
is
testimony
in
the
joint
appendix
that
the
officer
had
seen
them
boarding
the
bus,
and
that
is
at
j.a.
105.
in
response
to
questioning
by
the
court,
he
indicated
he
had
seen
them
boarding
the
bus,
but
there
was
no
testimony
in
this
record
that
he
ever
saw
them
together
before
he
saw
them
seated
next
to
each
other
in
the
seat.
and
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make,
going
to
that
question,
if
i
might,
is
that--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--yes,
sir.
but
he
never
said
that
they
were
traveling
together.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
well--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--i
think
that
if
they
had
looked
at
the...
at
the
passengers'
tickets,
they
would
have
had
reasonable
suspicion,
but
i
do
not
think
there
are
any
facts
in
this
case...
and
the
police
officer...
they're
the
best
ones
to
judge...
and
the
prosecutor
at
trial
all
agreed
there
was
no
reasonable
suspicion
here.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
yes,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
record
adequately
points
out
reasons
why
all
of
those
factors
could
have
been...
could
have
been
determined
to
be
totally
innocent.
the
innocent
people
could
have
been
doing
that
same
thing.
baggy
pants
are
very
popular
these
days.
one
can
look
anywhere
and
see
them.
there
were
reasons
why
they
would
have
had
their
coats
on.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
it
was
february
4th,
1999,
your
honor,
which
is
not--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--no,
your
honor,
because
i--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--i...
i
don't
believe
that
either.
i
think
that...
i
clearly
agree
with
bostick
that
on-bus
searches,
consensual--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--my
view
is
that
in
a
case
like
this,
which
is
at
the
margins,
where
a
court
of
appeals
looks
at
it
and
feels
that
it's
so
coercive
that
there
are
various
acts
or
omissions
that
the
police
can
do
to
ratchet
down
the
coerciveness
of
the
environment,
or
they
can
choose
to
counter
it,
which
the
most...
the
typical
example
we
see
is
the
giving
or...
or
withholding
of
advice.
and
certainly
that's
been
determinative
in
some
of
the
court's
cases
or
appears
to
have
been
outcome-determinative.
but
i
think
there
are
other
things
the
police
can
do.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
was
one
of
the
main...
there
were
two
main
points
of
arvizu.
one
was
to
reject
the
divide
and
conquer
approach
of
the
government
that,
well,
because
this...
this
factor
didn't
weigh
heavily,
we
shouldn't
even
look
at
it.
but
the
other
was
that
it
recognized
the
importance
of
a
court
of
appeals
in
a
totality
test,
employing
de
novo
review,
to
unify
precedent
and
to
provide
guidance
to
district
courts--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--justice
breyer,
i
don't
believe
i
can
give
this
court
a
bright
line
test
because
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
i
think
it's
the
nature
of
the
totality
test
that,
under
the
right
circumstances,
any
factor
can...
can
serve
to
tip
the
balance
in
the
right
circumstances.
and
so,
i...
i
don't
think
i
can
give
a
bright...
i
don't
think
a
bright
line
test
can
be
devised
when
the
totality
of
the
circumstances--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--well--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--unless
they
had
an
overwhelming
desire
to
cooperate
and
have
their
personal
stuff
gone
through.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
i
agree,
justice
stevens.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
well,
justice
scalia,
i
would
certainly
never
consent
to
them
checking
my
person
for
anything.
but
i'm
a
lawyer
and
i
know
that--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--i
would
like
to
address
the
government's
argument
that
there
is
a
per
se
rule
in
this
case.
and
one
of
the
points
they
make
is...
in
their
reply
brief
at
4,
they
argue
that
because
we
have
not
identified
one
case
in
which
the
eleventh
circuit
has
ruled
in
favor
of
the
government
in
an
on-bus
case...
i
have
been
able
to
identify
three
unpublished
decisions,
which
i'd
like
to
cite
to
the
court.
and
at
mr.
souter's
direction,
i
will
lodge
them
with
the
clerk
after
argument.
they
are:
the
mclean
case,
which
is
case
number
01-10678,
dated
july
6th,
2001,
after
washington;
the
reese
case,
00-11291,
dated
march
15th,
2001;
and
the
garrett
case,
dated...
case
number
97-2202,
dated
november
19th,
1997.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
it's
considered
persuasive
authority
but
not
binding
authority.
but
my
point
was
simply
that
if
they
had...
if
they
had
a
de
facto
per
se
rule,
then
it
would
be
outcome...
the
presence
or
absence
of
rights
would
be
outcome...
outcome-determinative
in
every
case.
but
in
those
three
cases,
which
were
on-bus
searches,
there
was
either
no
advice
or
no
mention
of
it
in
the
opinion.
and
of
course,
these
unpublished
opinions
are
very
hard
to
get,
but
the
government
gave
me
an
incentive
to
find
them.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
well,
justice
kennedy--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--i
agree
that
would
be
an
ideal
world
if
all
our
citizens
took
civics
or
took
law
and
knew
their
rights,
but
i
don't
believe
they
do.
and
i
think
the
fact
that
we
go
through
the
factors
is
simply
a
product
of
the
totality
test.
that's
necessary
to
look
at
all
the
relevant
factors
in
that
totality
test.
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
defining
point
at
which
one...
a
person
can
say
i
think
it's
up
to
the
court
in
every
case,
is
this
too
coercive,
does
it
go
too
far?
i
would
note
that
in
bostick,
bostick
did...
did
set
out
the
seizure
test
at
437,
the
consent
test
at
438.
the
one
thing
it
really
in
my
mind
didn't
really
clearly
focus
on
was
the
test
that
the
eleventh
circuit
was
looking
at.
the
question
they
looked
at
is
whether
the
circumstances
here
were
so
coercive
that
no
reasonable
person
could
have
given
a
consent
that
would
have
been
determined
to
be
voluntary.
and
i
think
that's
why
in
the
court's
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion...
this
is...
excuse
me...
footnote
4
at
page
6a
of
the
petition
to
the
appendix.
that
is
why
they
then
used
the
language...
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry.
it's
footnote
6
at
page
8a.
they
then
used
the
language,
quoting
bostick,
but
whether
a
reasonable
person
would
have
felt
free
to
decline
the
officer's
request.
and
i
think
that
is...
was
their
attempt
to
go
to
the
element
of
was
this...
was
this
a
coercive
environment.
it
distinguishes
it
from
the
seizure
test
which
focuses
on
the
police
conduct
and
what
it
would
have
communicated
and
i...
and
then
the
consent
test,
which
is
at
438,
which
focuses...
under
schneckloth
includes
a
focus
on
the
personal
factors,
factors
personal
to
the
defendant.
and
i
think
that's
why
the
court
here
said
that
those
factors
personal
to
the
defendant
were
not
determinative
because
we're
looking
at
a
little
higher
level
of
analysis
as
to
whether
this
environment
was
so
coercive.
i
do
agree
that
in
the
context
of
your
average
bus
case,
it's
a
very
short
encounter,
very
brief.
the
testimony
was
that
in
15
to
20
minutes,
the
officer
could
engage
with
two
to
three
people.
so,
you're
looking
maybe
5
to
10
minutes
per
person.
and
i
think
that
the
test...
that
the
factors
relating
to
seizure
and
the
factors
relating
to
the...
the
consent
tend
to
be
conflated,
and
so
it
is
sometimes
sort
of
hard
to
sort
out.
and
a
lot
of
the
factors
will
apply
to
both
of
those
tests.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
i
believe,
justice
scalia,
if
the
court
ruled
that,
it
would
be
a
bright
line
test
as
opposed
to
a
totality
test.
and
i
think
one
has
to...
when
one
applies
a
reasonable
person...
reasonable,
innocent
person
test,
one
of
necessity
puts
themselves
in
the
seat
of
that
bus
passenger.
how
do
they
feel?
and
that's
why,
justice
breyer,
i
tried
to
give
the...
the
little
example
of
the
airplane
because--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--justice
souter,
personally
yes,
i
do
agree
with
you.
i
think
it
is
an
inherently
coercive
environment.
but
i
simply
didn't
take
that
position
because
i
didn't
think
that
was
a
position
that
i
could--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--prevail
upon.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
yes,
sir.
i...
i
did
not
because
of
it
being
sort
of
a
bright
line.
but
i
guess
my
feel
about
it
is
that
there
seems
to
be
some
contradiction
between
when
we
talk
about
in
miranda,
we're
talking
about
a
coercive...
we're
talking
about
someone
who's
suspected
of
a
crime.
there's
probable
cause,
and
so
we're
going
to
give
them
some
warnings.
but
yet,
a
reasonable,
innocent
person,
millions
of
bus
passengers...
they
don't
get
anything.
and
there
just...
i
don't
know...
it
seems
to
me
something
wrong
with
that--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--there's
nothing
but
the
testimony
of
the
officer
as
to
what
he
thinks
they
felt.
there
is
no
testimony
of
the
passengers.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
no,
sir,
we
don't.
we
just
have
to
try
to
put
ourselves
in
their
shoes
and
how
would
we
feel.
not
being
lawyers--
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
i
think
that
is
the
primary
point
that
goes
to
justice
souter's
question
about
why
it
is
inherently
coercive.
it
sort
of
goes
back
to
a
royer's
situation
where
you
had
a
person
in
a
small,
enclosed
room.
but
i
personally...
if
you're
sitting
in
a
seat
and
that's
why
i
said
if...
if
the
person
like
a
stewardess
would
just
stand
there
and
not
come
right
in
your
face,
but
a
person
gets
in
your
face,
you
can't
move
over,
you
can't
back
up,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
possibly
get
out
of
the
seat
without...
even
if
you
wanted
to.
but
that's
not
the
test.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
the...
the
district
court
characterized
his
style
as
sort
of
in
your
face.
he
clearly
stood.
his
testimony
was
he
was
standing
in
the
aisle,
but
i
guess
behind...
he
didn't
say
this.
this
is
how
i
understand
it...
behind
the
arm...
behind
the
armrest
so
that
a
person
could
theoretically
get
their
legs
out.
my...
but
he
was
very
clearly
leaning
over
12
to
18
inches
from
mr.
drayton's
face,
holding
his
badge
up.
ms.
gwendolyn
spivey
thank
you
very
much.
