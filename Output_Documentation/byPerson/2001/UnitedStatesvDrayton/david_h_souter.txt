justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's...
it's
true
that
the...
the
issue
of
whether
someone
could
leave
the
bus
or
not
is...
is
not
really
an
issue
that...
that
focuses
the
question,
and
we
said
so
in
bostick.
but
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
it
was
irrelevant
in
bostick
or
that
it's
irrelevant
here
that
there
was
an
officer
stationed
at
the
front
of
the
bus.
if
we're
going
to
have
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
wouldn't
you
agree
that
that
is
one
relevant
fact
to
consider
in
trying
to
reconstruct
the
atmosphere
and
decide
whether
or
not
it
signaled
to
the...
to
the
person
searched
the...
the
possibility
of
just
ending
the
encounter?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
did...
nobody
said,
you
can't
leave
the
bus.
but
isn't
it
a
fact
that
a
passenger
would
take
into
some
consideration
that
there
was
an
officer
stationed
at
the
front
of
the
bus?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
wasn't
keeping
people
out,
apparently.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's...
it's
a
relevant
fact
in
determining
the
coerciveness
of
the
atmosphere,
is
it
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me...
let
me
try
a...
a
different
suggestion.
the
fact
that
the
officer
at
the
front
of
the
bus
was
kneeling
in
the
driver's
seat
was
one
graphic
reminder
of
another
fact
in
this
case,
and
that
is,
that
the
driver
was
gone.
the
driver
had
left
the
bus.
the
only
people
exercising
any
kind
of
official
capacity
in
that
bus
were
three
police
officers.
one
of
them
was
occupying
the
driver's
seat.
isn't
that
a
signal
that
nobody
is
going
to
be
going
anywhere
on
this
bus?
this
bus
isn't
going
to
be
going
anywhere
until
the
officers
are
satisfied.
now,
that
may
or
may
not
be
dispositive
of
anything,
but
it
is
a
relevant
fact
on
the
question
of
coercion
and
voluntariness.
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
agree
with
you.
you're...
you're
absolutely
right
there.
the...
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
that
you
can't
go
through
this
kind
of
analysis
and
say,
well,
this
fact
is
irrelevant.
this
shouldn't
have
been
considered
by
the
court.
that
fact
was
irrelevant.
that
shouldn't
have
been
considered.
it
was
a
relevant
fact.
what
it
all
adds
up
to,
as
you
suggest
by
the
delgado
reference,
is
a
different
question,
but
it's
a
relevant
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
--did
he
enter
with
the
other
two?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
doesn't
make
it
involuntary,
but
it...
it
does
suggest
perhaps
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
here
as...
as
against
your
claim
that
there
was
none
in
brown's
consent
because...
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
on
the
facts,
but
i...
i
think
the
first
request
to
brown
was...
or
maybe
to
the
two
of
them
together...
can
i
look
at
your...
your
luggage,
your
bag,
whatever
they
had
pointed
to,
and
they
said,
sure.
and
i
presume
they
said
sure
because
they
knew
there
was
nothing
in
it
that
was
going
to
be
incriminating.
so,
the
officer
looked
in
the...
in
the
luggage
and
he
found
nothing.
then
he
turned
to
brown
and
said,
mind
if
i
do
a
pat-down,
or
whatever
the
phrase
was.
well,
that's
the
search
that's
in
question
here,
and
i
would
have
thought
that
at
that
point
brown
was
in
the
situation
in
which
the
reasonable
citizen
would
have
thought
i'm
damned
if
i
do
and
i'm
damned
if
i
don't.
if
he
pats
me
down
and
he's...
he's
thorough
about
it,
he's
going
to
find
the...
the
drugs.
if
i
say
you
can't
pat
me
down,
having
just
given
permission
to
him
to...
to
look
in
the...
in
the
bag,
he's
going
to
know
that
there
must
be
something
on
me
that
wasn't
on
the
bag.
and...
and,
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
that
brown
at
that
point
was
by
no
means
in
a
position
in
which
he
had
a
kind
of
free
choice
to
say
yes
or
no.
so,
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
it
is
ambiguous.
have
i
got
the
facts
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and,
of
course,
i
would
agree--
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
but
don't...
don't
you
think
the
most
probable
inference
is
the
inference
i
gave
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
holding
in
bostick,
if
i
remember
it,
was
that
the
florida
supreme
court
was
wrong
in
adopting
a
per
se
rule
and
left
open
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
seizure
in
that
case.
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
don't
you
agree
with
that?
i
mean,
it
seemed
that
was
almost
the
question
that
i...
i
asked
when...
when
you
were
responding
to
justice
stevens
and
you
said,
well,
ultimately
sure,
anybody
who
gets
these
warnings,
with
a
teaspoonful
of
brains,
is
going
to
say
no,
i...
i'm
not
going
to
let
you
search.
and...
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
maybe
the...
the
answer
to
the
problem
is
there
are
some
situations
in
which
if
you
don't
give
the
warning,
it
does
get
to
the
point
of...
or
is
virtually
a...
a
coercive
situation
per
se,
and
it
may
be
that
there's
no
easy
answer
in
those
circumstances.
if
you
don't
let
them
know
that
they
have
a
right
to
refuse,
there's
inherent
coercion.
if
you
do
let
them
know,
most
people
are
going
to
say,
no,
you
can't
search.
but
you
resist
that.
you...
you
don't
regard
it
as
inherently
coercive.
and
i...
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
why
you...
you
resist
it.
why
isn't
it?
