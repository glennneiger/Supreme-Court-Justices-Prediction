mr.
thompson,
did
they
know
that
he
was
an
officer?
was
it
clear
that
he
was
an
officer?
justice
antonin
scalia
the...
the
other
two
officers
were
i
know,
but
was
there...
was
it
clear
that
the
person
kneeling
in
the
driver's
seat
was
an
officer?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
agree,
i
hope,
with
the...
with
the
proposition
that
there
would
be
no
reason
to
decline
the
pat-down
search
except
the
reason
that
he
had
something
incriminating
on
him.
i
mean,
the
mere
fact
that
you've...
you've
acceded
to
the
luggage
search,
which
is
a
much
less
intrusive
search,
does
not
show
that...
that
you
have
something
to
hide
when
you...
when
you
decline
to...
to
have
a
pat-down.
don't...
don't
you
agree
that
a
consent
to
a
luggage
search
is
a
lot
less
difficult
to
obtain
than
consent
to
a
pat-down?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
you're...
i
think
you're
missing
my
point.
justice
souter
was
suggesting
that
having
acceded
to
the
luggage
search,
the
only
plausible
reason
for
objecting
to
the
pat-down
would
be
that
i
have
something
on
me
that
is
incriminating.
and
i...
i
acceded
to
the
luggage
search
because
i
knew
there
was
nothing
incriminating.
but
don't
you
think
that
an
innocent
citizen
could
agree
to
a...
a
policeman's
search
of
luggage
but
not
agree
to
a
pat-down?
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
know,
let's
be
reasonable
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
explains
miranda,
of
course,
to
the
extent
anything
explains
it.
[laughter]
that...
that
was
a
custodial
interrogation,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the...
the
physical
custody
would
have
had
that...
that
effect
of...
of
causing
the
person
to
believe
that
he
had
no
choice.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
have
a
request
and
a
response.
and
the
response
is
that
there
is
no
objection
to
the
search.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
an
objective
consideration
of
the
highest
importance.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
seizure
of
the
person
or
seizure
of
the
contraband?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
assume
congress
could
enact
a
statute
like
that,
couldn't
it,
for
federal
officers?
couldn't
congress
prescribe
that
whenever
federal
drug
agents
enter
a
bus,
they...
and
to
conduct
a...
a
search,
they
shall
make
such
a
statement?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
have
no
problem
with
congress
doing
that,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
they
use
language
like
that
in
this
case?
did
they
say,
you
know,
open
your
coat,
i
want
to
pat
you
down?
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
they
make
it
clear
that
they
were
asking
permission
which
suggests
that
the
person
has
the
ability
to
deny
permission?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
words
did
they
use
in...
in
particular?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
and...
and
that's
all
they
asked,
and
when
the
person
said
yes,
they
immediately
searched
the
bag?
justice
antonin
scalia
surely,
surely
they
required
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
other
question
that
they
asked?
justice
antonin
scalia
does...
does
that
not
suggest
exactly
what
you
want
them
to
suggest,
that
the
person
has
the
ability
to
withhold
that
consent?
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
he
meant
their
consent
in
those
circumstances.
didn't
he
recite
in
the
opinion
all
of
the
circumstances
involved?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
it's
a
little
unfair
to...
to
read
that
after...
after
he
describes
the
whole
situation
as
simply
saying,
well,
since
they
consented,
it
must
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
can
say,
you
know,
i'm
going
to
torture
you
if
you
don't
let
me
look
at
it.
okay,
okay,
okay,
look
at
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
nobody
is
going
to
say
his
consent
shows
that
it
was
voluntary.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
when...
when
you're
asked
a
question,
do
you
mind
if
i
conduct
a
pat-down,
and
you
raise
up
your
arms
like
that,
what...
what
does
that
naturally
convey?
justice
antonin
scalia
mere
acquiescence.
justice
antonin
scalia
--acquiescence
would
be
just
to
sit
there,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
spivey,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that...
that
indicates
whether
the
police
knew
that
these
two
people
were
traveling
together?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the...
he
did
associate
the
two
of
them
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
both
wearing
heavy,
baggy
clothes,
although
the
weather
wasn't
that
cold
in
tallahassee
at
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
they're
sitting
next
to
each
other,
and
unlike
the
other
passengers
in
the
bus,
they're
all...
they're
both
wearing
heavy,
baggy
clothes.
i'm
not
sure
that...
that
the
major
result
of
the
first...
of
the
first
seizure
wouldn't
really
have
been
to
give
the
police
probable
cause
anyway
to...
to
search
the
second
passenger,
even
without
his
consent.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see...
you
see
two
guys
dressed
extravagantly
sitting
next
to
each
other.
you
search
the
first
one
and
find
drugs
on
him.
you
think
you're
not
going
to
search
the
second?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
have
searched
the
second
one.
i
would
have
thought
i
had
probable
cause
having
two
guys
both
dressed
in
baggy
clothes
in
warm
weather,
i
find
drugs
on
the
first,
they're
sitting
next
to
each
other.
i
think
i
would
have
probable
cause
to
search
the
second.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
in
tallahassee
in
the
summertime.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
agree.
i...
i
know
it's
risk-free,
and
i
would
certainly
give
my
consent.
i
think
it's
a
good
thing
for
the
police
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
was
dressed
like
that,
i
would.
if
i
was
dressed
like
that
on
a
hot
day,
i'd
be
probably--
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm...
i'm
only
using
the
record,
chief
justice.
the
record...
the
record
says
it
was
unusually
hot.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
is
it
that
the
most
immediate
expression
of
the
police
officers
does
not
counteract
whatever
other
indications
of
compulsion
might
exist
under
the
circumstances?
i
mean,
if
the
policeman
comes
up
and
says,
you
know,
lean
up
against
the
wall,
spread
your
legs,
i'm
going
to
pat
you
down,
you're
under
compulsion.
but
if
he
comes
up
and
says,
do
you
mind
if
i
search
your
person,
you
know,
i
don't
care
what
other...
there's
a
policeman
in
the
front
of
the
bus.
who
cares?
he...
he
has
made
it
very
clear
that
he's
asking
for
your
permission.
what...
what
more
need
he
do
than
that?
do
you
mind
if
i
search
your
person?
