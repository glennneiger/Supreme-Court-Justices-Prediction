what
if
the
state
law
in
effect
tinkered
with
how
you
interpret
the
plan,
and
and
spelled
out
that
in
determining
what's
medically
necessary
the
plan
will
make
use
of
an
independent
medical
consultant.
justice
sandra

o'connor
say,
and
furthermore,
if
there's
any
dispute
you
will
use
an
independent
medical
consultant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
necessarily.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
understand
that
that,
[background}
you
could
view
it
through
that
lens,
could
you
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i-
is
that
so
surprising,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
erisa
law
itself
excludes
regulations
of
insurance?
the
the
law
itself
took
that
out
of
erisa
coverage...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
case,
unum
versus
ward,
and
held
that
any
statute
that
effectively
creates
a
mandatory
contract
term
and
regulates
only
insurance
companies
is
an
insurance
law
under
the
savings
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
your
theory
there
could
be
no
private
arbitration
agreement
by
an
hmo
plan
and
and
people
covered
by
the
plan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
see
how
it's
open
under
your
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
your
rationale,
five
oh
two
controls.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
some
close
to
forty
states
have
laws
like
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there's
legislation
introduced,
at
least
in
congress,
to
accomplish
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
status
of
that
pending
legislation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
most
of
the
state
law
provisions
similar
to
the
one
in
illinois?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
provide
for
liquidated
damages,
do
you
think...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
regulation
exception?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
illinois,
under
this
illinois
law,
whether
there's
an
adequate
treatment
that's
less
expensive?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
element
in
it
of
determining
whether
there's
a
slightly
less
effective
remedy,
but
with
fewer
risks
and
less
costly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
irrelevant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
insurance
contract,
those
those
provisions?
it
wouldn't
conflict
with
illinois
law,
though.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
[inaudible]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
accept
that
this
is
an
arbitration
system,
then?
do
i
understand
that
in
your
response
to
these
questions?
you
think
it
is
an
arbitration
system?
