justice
antonin
scalia
w-
would
you
state
the
the
absurd
positions
again?
i'm
they
didn't
didn't
strike
me
as
that
absurd,
but...
justice
antonin
scalia
i-
it
says
that
in
the
certificate?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
the
the
question
is,
who
is
who
is
to
decide
whether
she
has
gotten
what
she
was
supposed
to
get?
and
what
the
claim
here
is
that
that
was
supposed
to
be
decided
pursuant
to
one
system
of
of
review,
and
the
state
has
substituted
a
totally
different
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
pilot
life
was
all
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that
all
it
meant
was
was
you
know
the
last
the
last
shot
has
to
be
in
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
provide
that
all
of
these
contract
claims
would
be
first
reviewed
in
state
court
so
long
as
it
further
provides
that
the
ultimate
judgment
of
the
state
court
would
only
be
enforceable
by
suit
in
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
arbitration
is
not
is
not
another
another
means
of
of
review?
i
mean,
i...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
remedy...
justice
antonin
scalia
your
your
remedy
is
not
is
not
a
lawsuit
but
arbitration?
i...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
th-
i
find
that
a
a
startling
proposition.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
your
i-
your
i-
your
colloquy
with
justice
souter?
the
conclusion
that
you
drew
is
is
that
this
is
not
really
arbitration
because
it's
a
it's
a
doctor.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
submissions
to
the
to
the
doctor
in
this
situation?
justice
antonin
scalia
contain?
i
hm-
i
f-
would
find
it
surprising
if
both
sides
didn't
press
upon
the
doctor
their
their
view
of
the
c-
of
of
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
did
you
put
any
questions
to
to
the
doctor?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
ab-
what
about
a
law
firm
that
that
that
handles
all
of
all
of
the
client's
legal
business,
just
as
an
hmo
handles
all
of
the
client's
medical
business,
for
a
flat
fee.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
don't
know
how
much
it's
going
to
come
to
for
the
year,
and
the
other
one
is
providing
medical
services
and
they
don't
know
how
much
it's
going
to
come
to
for
the
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
does,
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
i
think
the
question
of
what's
insurance
under
erisa
is
is
a
federal
question,
not
a
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
look
at
it
that
way,
or
you
could
look
at
it
that
it
provides,
the
state
law
provides
a
cause
of
action
before
this
arbitrator.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
you
have
a
a
claim
before
the
arbitrator
that
you
haven't
gotten
what
is
medically
necessary,
and
the
arbitrator
shall
resolve
that
cause
of
action
just
as,
under
erisa,
the
court
would
would
have
resolved
what
what
the
contract
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
only
remedies
that
that
that
you
can't
displace
erisa
d-
w-
with
are
judicial
remedies.
justice
antonin
scalia
give
you
a
very
different
remedy?
i
mean,
t-
to
say
that
it
isn't
just
a
matter
of
delay,
that
isn't
the
problem
here.
