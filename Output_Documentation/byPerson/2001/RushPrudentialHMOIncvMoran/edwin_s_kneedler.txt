mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
in
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
of
the
petition,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
that's
the
ordinary
understanding
of
what
a
cause
of
action
is.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
my
point
is,
that's
what
that's
what
f-
s-
section
five
oh
two
a
addresses,
and
the
c-
and
the
analysis
in
in
pilot
life
was,
what
does
five
oh
two
a
displace,
and
it's
another
important
feature
of
pilot
life
is,
w-
the
court
went
through
the
various
remedies
that
section
five
oh
two
a
provides,
and
and
tellingly
discussed
this
court's
decision
in
russell
in
which
the
court
held
that
dam-
punitive
damages
were
not
a
w-
available
in
a
suit
against
a
fiduciary
based
on
a
on
claims
processing,
and
the
court
said
it
was
not
going
to
allow
a
state
cause
of
action
to
displace
congress'
judgment
about
what
damage
remedies
to
allow
and
not...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
and
if
it
also
did
not
provide
for
relief
beyond
th-
that
was
available
in
the
plan
itself.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
i
th-
i
think
that
would
not
be
preempted.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
i
i
th-
i
think
the
the
analysis
there
would
be
one
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
under
the
plan,
including
those...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
could
be
excused,
and
the
department
of
labor's
regulations,
and
they've
e-
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the
department
of
labor
has
f-
addressed
that
under
its
claims
processing
regulations.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
nothing
in
section
five
oh
two
and
this
court
made
this
clear
in
firestone
specifies
the
standard
of
review.
