mr.
roberts,
could
you
help
me
with
one
part
of
the
facts
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about?
your
your
opponents
argue
there's
a
difference
between
the
plan
and
the
hmo,
and
that
that
he
claims
that
that
he
that
what
you
say
would
apply
to
a
suit
against
the
plan,
but
this
is
a
suit
against
the
hmo,
and
i
have
been
unable
to
find
the
plan
in
the
papers.
is
the
plan
in
the
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
certificate
of
coverage
who
are
the
parties
to
the
certificate
of
coverage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
in
in
your
view,
i
mean
you
say
that
they
just
hooked
by
their
allegation,
or
do
you
think
it's
clear
that
that
is
the
correct
d-
th-
that
is
the
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
say
that's
an
insurance
policy
that
is
purchased
by
the
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
one
could
also
say
it's
not
really
a
new
remedy,
it's
a
new
protection,
sort
of
like
the
see,
the
question
is
whether
pilot
life
controls
or
the
massachusetts
case
controls.
justice
john
paul
stevens
provides.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
another
difference
with
pilot
life,
and
that,
the
only
question
is
whether
it
related
to
the
insurance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
fiduciary,
i-
a
definition
of
his
powers
of
review
and
so
forth,
in
the
record
anywhere?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
you
s-
you
you've
two
or
three
times
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
plan
gives
the
fiduciary
this
rev-
standard
of
review.
justice
john
paul
stevens
plan
might
actually
say,
whatever
f-
illinois
law
requires
the
decision-maker
to
do
shall
be
done.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
the
plan
says
that,
too,
for
all
i
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
fiduciary's
decision,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
sit
down,
would
you
just
give
me
a
moment
of
your
views
on
whether
or
not
it's
appropriate
to
regard
the
hmo
as
an
insurance
company?
justice
john
paul
stevens
question
whether
it's
an
insurance
company.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
sh-
illinois
insurance
commissioner
regulate
the
terms
of
that
policy
in
any
respect,
other
than
this
five
ten
this
four
ten
c
provision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
this
hmo
issued
to
this
employer
same
as
ad-
the
same
form
policy
that
it
iss-
it
gives
to
many
other
purchasers
of
hmo
services
from
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
okay.
