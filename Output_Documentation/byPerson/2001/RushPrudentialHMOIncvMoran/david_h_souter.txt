this

i
i
i'm
assuming
in

to
your
from
your
answer
to
justice
stevens,
i'm
assuming
that
in
this
case
it
is
so,
but
their
their
argument
is,
you
can
have
hmo's
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
erisa
plans,
and
you
can
have
erisa
plans
that
don't
employ
a
hmo
s
to
provide
welfare
benefits,
and
therefore
it's
appropriate
to
think
of
this
as
a
medical
decision
or
or
or
as
a
regulation
of
of
medical
practice
in
a
particular
form,
rather
than
insurance,
so
once
again
there's
th-
the
the
problem
is
that
the
facts
do
not
place
this
in
a
in
a
in
a
clear

conflict?
wouldn't
it
also
conflict
with
the
statutory
provision?
justice

okay,
c-
consistent
with
that,
in
a
shorthand
kind
of
way
w-
we
have
referred
to
this
as
as
an
arbitration,
or
as
an
arbitrator's
decision.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
they
did
in
that
case,
i-
but
my
my
concern
is,
is
that
true
here?
in
other
words,
what
can
you
tell
me
about
the
terms
under
which
the
reviewer
acts
that
says
this
is,
and
in
in
part
at
least,
or
ultimately,
an
independent
decision
by
the
reviewer
about
medical
necessity
as
opposed
to
an
adjudication
of
which
side
has
the
better
claim,
which
an
arbitrator
might
make?
justice

but
may
i
go
back
to...
justice
david
h.
souter
that
that
may
be,
but
li-
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question
for
a
minute.
justice

was
exhausting,
wouldn't
you...
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
that
mean,
then,
that
that
that
your
answers
to
the
several
questions
on
this
should
be,
i-
it
ultimately
is
a
question
of
degree,
this
requirement
of
one
step
in
a
review
process
doesn't
reach
the
point,
in
effect,
of
excluding
the
federal
remedy?

the
first
of
these
is
no.
00-1021,
rush
prudential
hmo,
inc.
against
moran.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974
(erisa)
preempts
state
laws
that
relate
to
employee
benefit
plans,
but
it
saves
from
preemption
state
laws
that
regulate
insurance.
the
question
here
is
whether
section
410
of
the
illinois
health
maintenance
organization
act
is
preempted.
the
petitioner
rush
prudential
is
an
hmo
that
provides
medical
services
for
employee
benefit
plans
covered
by
erisa.
the
respondent
debra
moran
is
a
beneficiary
under
a
rush
health
plan.
she
sought
an
unusual
medical
treatment
and
rush
denied
it
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
medically
necessary.
the
situation
is
addressed
by
illinois
hmo
act
which
guarantees
that
in
certain
disputes
over
the
medical
necessity
of
a
treatment,
an
independent
physician
will
review
the
claim.
if
the
reviewer
decides
that
treatment
is
necessary,
the
hmo
must
provide
it.
moran
sued
to
force
rush
to
comply
with
the
statute.
the
reviewer
here
found
that
moran’s
treatment
was
necessary.
rush
argued
that
the
reviewer’s
decision
did
not
matter
because
the
illinois
act
was
preempted
by
erisa.
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
act
was
a
law
that
regulated
insurance
and
was
saved
from
preemptions.
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
affirm.
hmo
as
defined
by
illinois
both
provides
health
care
and
assumes
the
financial
risk
of
providing
it.
thus,
the
act
is
targeted
toward
the
segment
of
the
insurance
industry
and
it
regulates
insurance
within
the
meaning
of
the
erisa
provision
that
preserves
state
law.
this
alone
would
answer
the
question
of
preemption
but
for
the
fact
that
in
pilot
life
insurance
against
the
dedeaux,
we
held
that
even
state
insurance
laws
might
be
preempted
if
they
interfered
with
erisa's
exclusive
scheme
of
remedies
for
benefit
denials.
here,
rush
contends
that
the
act
provides
a
remedy
binding
arbitration
and
is
therefore
preempted
under
pilot
life.
we
do
not
accept
the
argument
because
the
act
does
not
provide
any
cause
of
action
or
separate
relief
a
plan
member
like
moran
must
still
sue
under
ersia
to
obtain
benefits.
the
independent
review
procedure
is
not
a
true
arbitration
but
is
instead
more
like
a
medical
judgment
that
states
may
regulate.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia,
and
justice
kennedy.
