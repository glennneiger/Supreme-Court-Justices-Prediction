justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
you
to
expand
just
a
little,
because
i'm
i've
actually
been
trying
to
work
out
what's
the
framework
within
which
we
think
of
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
help
with
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh
i
see
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
absurd,
in
their
view,
anyway,
because
they're
saying
they
have
the
human
being
over
here
called
an
arbitrator
and
this
human
being
tells
you
what
the
benefit
is,
and
what
your
clients
are
really
objecting
to,
frankly,
is
not
this
remedy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
works
in
illinois?
i
mean,
i'm
also
quite
surprised
that
in
the
illinois
system,
which
has
been
running
from
some
time,
the
patient
wouldn't
have
an
opportunity
to
say
to
the
arbitrator,
this
is
my
side
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
doctors
who
d-
think
the
other
way
don't
have
an
opportunity
to
tell
the
arbitrator
what
their
position
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
a
lot
of
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
answer?
do
you
not
are
you
not
familiar
with
the
system
in
illinois?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
long-going
system,
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
case
illinois
has
ever
had?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
arbitration
system
has
ever
worked
in
illinois?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
be
amazed
if
peop-
i
mean,
am
i
right
to
be
amazed
that
you
have
a
system
where
people
can't
make
arguments...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
present
their
point
of
view
to
the
arbitrator?
i've
never
come
across
such
a
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
question,
which
is
the
thing
that's
w-
i'd
very
much
appreciate
before
your
time
expires,
if
y-
you
could
just
address,
oh,
for
at
least
a
minute
or
so
what
i
think
is
a
difficult
aspect
of
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
w-
that's
why
i
gave
my
example,
because
i
wanted
you
to
see
that
virtually
every
manufacturer
of
the
united
states
is
a
insurer
in
that
sense.
