mr.
daniel
p.
albers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
the
illinois
law
does
not
provide
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
i
originally
brought
the
action
in
state
court
to
enforce
the
independent
review
because
the
insurer
was
refusing
to
provide
any
independent
review
at
all,
and
the
t-
two
parts
of
the
statute,
the
requirement
that
there
be
medical
necessity,
this
review
and
then
the
actual
enforcement
of
the
decision,
were
parsed
at
the
district
court
level
and
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
i
think
in-
consistent
with
the
court's
ruling
in
in
pilot
life,
it
would
be
a
five
oh
two
action
to
seek
benefits.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
you
mean,
other
than
the
benefit
itself,
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
i
would
submit,
under
your
the
court's
ruling
which
you
wrote
in
in
pilot
life,
that
it
would
probably
be
inappropriate
to
go
beyond
specific
damages
that
are
p-
permitted
in
erisa,
which
is
recovery
of
the
benefit,
and
i
think
then
under
the
statute
you're
permitted
to
to
recover
interest
and
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
and
under
f-
five
fourteen
b,
the
savings
clause,
the
state
has
the
right
to
do
that.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
pilot
life
did
did
not
talk
about
who
the
decision-maker
would
be.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
i
think
that's
e-
i-
if
the
state
law
provided
for
a
judicial
review
in
state
court,
i
think
that
would
offend
five
oh
two.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
m-
and
this
gets
down
to
the
issue
of
what
a
remedy
is,
and
i
looked
up
remedy
in
black's
law
dictionary,
and
it
has
two
elements.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
i
think
this
is
not
i
think
you're
right.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
the
statute
itself,
four
ten,
requires
an
independent
review
by
a
physician
in
the
relevant
specialty.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
no.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
the
statute
doesn't
address
that.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
illinois
law
does
not
define
medical
necessity,
and
so
for
our
analysis
we've
assumed
the
only
place
that
the
reviewer
could
go
would
be
to
the
plan
documents
and
the
plan
document
here
is
there
is
no
plan
document,
but
the
relevant
portion
of
the
plan
document
is
the
insurance
contract
which
defined
mental
medical
necessity,
and
that's
what
the
reviewer
used.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
there
were
a
variety
of
of
factors
to
consider.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
i
think
that's
an
up
to
the
judgment
of
the
independent
reviewing
physician.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
m-
my
understanding
of
what
justice
souter
asked
me
was
did
it
had
the
traditional
elements
of
what
we
consider
an
arbitration,
which
is,
you
you
review
the
evidence
from
both
sides,
they
have
an
opportunity
to
to
argue,
and
then
you
make
a
decision,
and
that's
what
i
meant
when
i
said
it's
not
classic
arbitration.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
the
l-
the
illinois
law
does
not
provide
and
and
actually
what
for
the
specifics
of
that,
what
it
does
say
is
that
the
hmo
must
set
up
the
independent
review
mechanism,
and
there
is
no
authority
in
illinois
on
what
that
must
contain
or
not
contain.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
all
i
can
tell
you
is
what
happened
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
what
are
the
risks,
and
so
on,
and
then
he
was
given
all
of
the
relevant
medical
records
and
given
the
definition
of
medical
necessity,
and
he
made
a
determination
that
this
particular
surgery
was...
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
we
did
not,
because
they
had
covered
all
the
questions
we
thought
were
relevant.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
your
honor,
i'm
probably
as
familiar
as...
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
this
is
the
only
l-
law
legal
case
that's
ever
been
brought
under
the...
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
th-
i
have
no
data
on
that,
and
the
state
it
doesn't
keep
data
on
that.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
i
think
it
is
an
arbitration,
in
that
it
goes
to
a
neutral
third...
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
precludes
either
one
of
the
parties
from...
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
yes
to
de-
yes
to
both
those
questions.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
well,
laws
regulating
them
would
not
be
directed
to
them
as
acting
as
insurers.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
the
this
is
law
is
limited
t-
to
the
insurance
industry.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
yes,
abs-
for
purposes
of
five
fourteen
b,
but
we
look
at
those
factors,
and
one
relevant
factor
is
whether
it
whether
the
the
state
considers
it
to
be
an
insurer
or
whether
it
regulates
it
as
an
insurer,
and
in
both
situations
it
does
here.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
yes.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
yes.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
i
i
can
only
assume
it
is.
mr.
daniel
p.
albers
thank
you.
