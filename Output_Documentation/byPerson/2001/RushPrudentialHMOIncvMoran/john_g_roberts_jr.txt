mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
erisa
preemption
cases
can
be
exceedingly
complicated,
but
our
submission
this
morning
is
straightforward.
this
court
held
in
pilot
life
that
erisa's
civil
enforcement
provisions
were
the
exclusive
remedy
for
improper
processing
of
a
claim
for
benefits
under
an
erisa-regulated
plan.
the
illinois
independent
external
review
law
at
issue
in
this
case
affords
a
different
remedy
for
a
beneficiary
dissatisfied
with
an
hmo's
denial
of
benefits.
the
illinois
law
is
therefore
preempted.
just
last
week,
in
great
west
life,
this
court
began
its
analysis
by
noting
that
it
was
especially
reluctant
to
tamper
with
erisa's
enforcement
scheme,
and
by
quoting
prior
precedent
for
the
proposition
that
that
enforcement
scheme
indicated
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
authorize
other
remedies
that
it
forgot
to
incorporate
expressly.
that
same
language,
quoted
in
great
west
life,
was
quoted
fifteen
years
ago
in
pilot
life.
erisa's
remedies
are
exclusive,
whether
we're
talking
about
additional
federal
remedies
or
additional
state
remedies.
[inaudible]
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
respondent
alleged
in
the
complaint,
joint
appendix
page
thirty-two
and
thirty-eight
that
the
certificate
of
coverage
was
the
plan,
and
that
is
in
the
record.
it
is
exhibit
a
to
the
complaint.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
certificate
of
coverage
is
an
agreement
between
the
hmo
and
the
employer
that
extends
to
particular
employees
the
benefits
that
are
set
forth
there.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
they're
first
bound
by
their
allegation,
but
second
of
all,
even
if
other
documents
also
contribute
terms
to
the
plan,
certainly
the
certificate
of
coverage
c-
indicates
elements
of
the
plan.
there
may
be
other
documents
that
set
forth
other
terms
of
the...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
plan.
see...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
totally
wrong
because
the
question
is
not
how
the
state
law
operates
to
grant
a
new
remedy
to
a
beneficiary.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
and
the
and
i
think
the
difference
is,
be-
between
mandated
benefits
laws
like
massachusetts,
th-
those
laws
provide,
as
this
court
said
in
unum,
a
rule
of
decision
that
is
to
be
applied
by
whoever
the
decision-maker
is
in
in
reviewing
a
denial
of
benefits.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
w-
we
don't
think
that's
a
correct
characterization.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
with
respect,
i
think
the
facts
do
place
this
in
a
very
clear
category,
because
there's
no
question
of
treatment
at
issue.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
state
law
can
define
medical
necessity.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
it
cannot
do
consistent
with
pilot
life,
because
that
is
a
remedy
for
a
denial
of
benefits,
and
pilot
life...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
and
i
think,
as
judge
posner
pointed
out
in
his
dissent,
if
you
do
that,
then
all
bets
are
off.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
was
the
c-
specific
question
addressed
in
pilot
life.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
u
u
unum
did
not
involve
a
remedy.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
argument
is
made
that
this
is
okay
because
all
you
get
are
the
benefits
that
you're
entitled
to
under
the
plan.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
arbitration
a-
the
it
it's
the
difference
between
a
voluntary
agreement
between
the
parties,
which
is
what
erisa
seeks
to
enforce,
and
i-
something
that's
compelled
by
state
law.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
would
survive
because
it
would
be
regarded
as
an
internal
plan
procedure,
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
and
well
we
actually
go
on
to
the
the
third
game
which
is,
if
it
conflicts
with
the
substantive
term
of
erisa,
and
this
is
what
pilot
life
held,
it
is
it
is
preempted,
and
this
conflicts
with
the
exclusivity
of
of
the
remedies.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
again,
that
poses
sort
of
the
conflict
between
what
the
court
in
pilot
life
said
were
the
exclusive
remedies
and
the
savings
clause.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
i
do
think
it's
particularly
bad,
but
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
state
law,
it
of
the
the
illinois
hmo
act.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
absurd
is
that
they
have
to
maintain
that
this
can
only
be
enforced
under
a
five
oh
two
action,
that
the
state
law
claim
keep
in
mind
this
began,
of
course,
as
a
state
law
claim
in
the
state
court.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
because
there's
a
different
decision-maker
making
the
decision
on
your
claim
for
the
denial
of
benefits,
and
that's
what
makes
it
clear
that
what's
involved
is
a
different
remedy.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
the...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
p-
the
law
provides.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
because
the
the
the
elements
of
the
plan
that
are
in
the
record,
the
certificate
of
coverage,
notes
that
the
hmo
has
the
broadest
possible
discretion
to
interpret
the
terms
of
the
plan
in
deciding
coverage
and,
under
this
court's
decision
in
firestone...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
an-
and
pages
seven
and
pages
eight.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
understanding
of
many
of
the
pending
bills
is
that
they
have
an
external
review
provision
but,
of
course,
it's
a
federal
one,
and
that
is
consistent
with
erisa
s
goal
of
uniformity
in
claims
processing
and
administration.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
eee
eee,
you
know,
no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
various
times
passage
is
imminent,
and
then
i-
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
falls
apart,
but
again
it's
a
very
different
thing
to
say,
this
is
the
f-
uniform
federal
remedy,
and
this
and
to
have,
as
your
honor
points
out,
at
present,
forty
different
remedies,
if
you're
running
a
company
that
has
a
health
care
plan
with
operations
in
different
states,
the
health
plan
can't
be
uniformly...
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
all
have
differences.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
it's
more
disturbing.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
whom
that
dis-
discretion
has
been
delegated
under
erisa,
and
there's
a
provision
in
erisa
that
allows
them
to
say,
this
is
the
the
entity
that
is
going
to
make
the
final
decision.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
hmo
is
properly
regarded
as
an
insurance
company
when
it
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
