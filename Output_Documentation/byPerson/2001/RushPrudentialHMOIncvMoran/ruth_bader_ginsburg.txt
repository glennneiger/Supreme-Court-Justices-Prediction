unum
was
was
a
a
question
of
how
how
late
could
you
file,
and
the
state
law
said
you
could
file
late.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
that
be
treated
differently?
the
state
is
making
something
timely,
e-
giving
the
beneficiary
a
chance
to
collect
that
the
plan
itself
would
not
have
given.
justice
ruth

ginsburg
the-
e-
kind
of
remedy
than
saying,
for
example,
punitive
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
i
thought
that's
what
pilot
life
was
about.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
that
a
more
disturbing
change
than
changes
in
what
is
the
minimum
required
coverage?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he-
what
was
the
definition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
word
n-
necessity
sounds
like
it
means
you
have
to
have
this,
and
if
you'd
had
something
that
would
be
equally
effective
and
less
expensive,
then
it
wouldn't
be
a
medical
necessity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whether,
su-
suppose
i
think
justice
o'connor
asked
you,
suppose
there
was
an
effective
treatment
that
was
less
expensive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
this
particular
treatment
still
be
a
medical
necessity,
and
i
thought
you
answered
yes
to
that
question.
