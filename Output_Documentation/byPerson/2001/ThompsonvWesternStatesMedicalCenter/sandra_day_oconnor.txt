justice

--well,
can't
congress
limit
the
compounding
to
the
ordinary
prescription
service
that
we
expect
pharmacists
to
be
doing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
they
added
this
ban
on
advertising.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
all
those
things
take
care
of
the
government's
interest
in
problems?
what
justifies
the
additional
ban
on
promotion
and
advertising?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
what
i
don't
understand
is,
if
congress
can
limit
in
all
these
other
ways
the
use
of
compounding
of
drugs,
then
why
does
it
need
this
additional
ban?
the
court
below
seemed
to
think
that
it
was
not
necessary,
and
i
think
i
have
the
same
problem.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
there
any
allegation
here
that
the
ads
are
false
or
fraudulent,
misleading,
deceptive?
i
mean,
you
could
always
attack
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
when
you
have
the
basic
provision
that
compounding
can
only
be
conducted
in
response
to
a
prescription
by
a
physician,
it's
hard
to
understand
why
it
has
to
be
accompanied
by
a
ban
on
truthful
speech
about
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
we've
had
a
long
history
in
this
very
court
of
giving
voice
to
the
notion
that
truthful
advertising
is
acceptable
in
this
country.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
presumably
compounding
cannot
be
done
without
resorting
to
approve...
the
use
of
approved
drugs.
it's
diluting
it,
it's
mixing
it
some
way
for
children,
it's
adding
some
kind
of
sweetener
so
they
can
swallow
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
what's
going
to
happen...
the
government
for
some
reason
did
not
raise
on
certiorari
the
issue
of
the
severability
of
the
advertising
provision,
so
if
it
is
determined
here
that
we
should
affirm
the
judgment
below,
and
the
cause
is
not
severable,
then
do
we
go
back
to
the
old
regime,
which
would
allow
no
leeway
for
compounding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
leeway
for
compounding.
do
we
go
back
to
a
more
limited
regime
for
your
clients,
i
assume?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
drug
compounding
is
a
process
by
which
a
pharmacist
or
doctor
combines,
mixes,
or
alters
ingredients
to
create
a
medication
tailored
to
the
needs
of
an
individual
patients,
such
as
a
patient
who
is
allergic
to
an
ingredient
in
a
mass
produced
drug.
section
503a
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
modernization
act
of
1997,
the
acronym,
i
guess
is
pronounce
fdama,
excempts
compounded
drugs
from
the
food
and
drug
administration
standard
drug
approval
requirements.
so
long
as
the
providers
of
those
drugs
abide
by
several
restrictions
including
that
the
prescription
for
it
be
unsolicited
and
that
the
providers
refrain
from
advertising
or
promoting
any
particular
compounded
drug,
class
of
drug
or
type
of
drug.
the
respondents,
a
group
of
licensed
pharmacies
that
specialize
in
compunding
drugs,
sought
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
the
advertising
and
solicitation
restrictions,
arguing
that
they
violate
the
first
amendments's
free
speech
guarantee.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
respondent's
holding
that
the
advertising
provisions
of
the
act
do
not
meet
the
test
for
acceptable
government
regulation
of
commercial
speech
and
that
test
is
set
out
in
a
case
of
this
court
decided
in
1980
called
central
hudson
gas
&
electric
corporation
versus
the
public
service
commission.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
in
relevant
part.
we
granted
certiorari
and
also
now
affirm.
neither
party
disputes
that
the
central
hudson
gas
for
permissible
commercial
speech
regulation
is
applicable.
under
that
test,
the
commercial
speech
in
question,
must
concern
lawful
activity
and
not
be
misleading,
the
assertive
govermental
interest
to
be
served
by
the
regulation
must
be
substantial
and
the
regulation
must
directly
advance
the
government
interest
and
not
be
more
extensive
than
necessary
to
serve
that
interest.
the
government
in
this
case
does
not
argue
that
the
prohibited
advertisements
would
be
about
unlawful
activity
or
would
be
misleading,
instead
the
government
argues
that
the
act
satisfies
the
remaining
three
parts
of
the
central
hudson
test.
the
government
says
that
three
substantial
interests
underlie
the
act:
first
preserving
the
effectiveness
and
integrity
of
the
food
and
drug
administration's
new
drug
approval
process
and
the
protection
of
public
health
that
it
provides;
second,
preserving
the
availability
of
compounded
drugs
for
those
individual
patients
who
cannot
use
products
that
have
been
approved
by
the
fda;
and
third,
achieving
the
proper
balance
between
these
two
competing
interest.
we
agreed
that
these
are
important
interests
and
that
the
government
needs
to
be
able
to
draw
a
line
between
small
scale
compounding
and
large
scale
drug
manufacturing.
that
line
must
distinguish
compounded
drugs
produced
on
such
a
small
scale
that
it
is
not
feasible
for
them
to
undergo
safety
and
efficacy
testing
from
the
drugs
produced
and
sold
on
a
large
enough
scale
that
they
can
undergo
such
testing
and
therefore
must
do
so.
the
government
argues
that
the
act's
speech
related
provisions
provide
just
such
a
line,
as
long
as
pharmacists
do
not
advertise
particular
compounded
drugs,
they
may
sell
compounded
drugs
without
undergoing
safety
and
efficacy
testing
and
obtaining
fda
approval.
in
previous
cases
addressing
the
central
hudson
test,
however,
we
have
made
clear
that
if
the
government
can
achieve
its
interest
in
a
manner
that
does
not
restrict
speech
or
that
restricts
less
speech,
it
must
do
so,
and
several
non-speech
related
approaches
we
think
are
possible
here.
for
example,
the
government
could
ban
the
use
of
commercial
scale
equipment
in
compounding
drug
products.
it
could
prohibit
pharmacists
from
compounding
more
drugs
in
anticipation
of
receiving
prescriptions
then
in
response
to
actual
prescriptions
already
received,
or
it
could
prohibit
pharmacists
from
offering
compounded
drugs
at
wholesale.
the
government
does
not
offer
to
any
reason
why
these
possibilities
alone
or
in
combination
would
be
insufficient
to
prevent
compounding
from
occuring
on
a
large
scale
so
as
to
undermine
that
new
drug
approval
process.
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
or
the
government's
brief
is
there
any
explanation
of
why
the
government
believe
that
forbidding
advertisiing
was
necessary
as
opposed
to
merely
a
convenient
way
of
achieving
its
interest,
but
it
is
well
established
that
the
party
is
seeking
to
uphold
a
restriction
on
commercial
speech
carries
the
burden
of
justifying
it.
if
the
first
amendment
means
anything,
it
means
that
regulating
speech
must
be
a
last,
not
a
first
resort.
