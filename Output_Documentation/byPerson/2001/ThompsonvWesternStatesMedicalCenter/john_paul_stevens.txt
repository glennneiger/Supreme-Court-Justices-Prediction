mr.
kneedler,
isn't
it
true
that...
we
haven't
talked
about
the
severability
issue,
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
whole
statute
has
been
held
unconstitutional,
because
they
disagreed
with
the
district
court
on
the
severability
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
you
still
can
enforce...
i
would
have
thought
the
parties
to
be
arguing
the
opposite
sides
of
this
case,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
it
seemed
to
me
the
statute
actually
helps
the
compounders,
because
it
makes
legal
something
that
is
otherwise
illegal,
and
if
the
statute's
knocked
out,
you
have
all
your
enforcement
mechanisms
to
prevent
them
from
doing
the
mass
marketing,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
your
opponents
would
be
better
off
if
the
statute
were
held
to
be
constitutional
than
having
it
held
unconstitutional,
because
you
now
may
prevent
them
from
doing
what
you're
basically
saying
is
the
wrong...
is
marketing
new
drugs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
talking
about
central
hudson
and
the
narrow
tailoring
notion,
or
whether
it's
sufficiently
tailored.
i
forget
the
exact
language.
i
take
it
you'd
have
a
much
stronger
case
if
the
prohibition
was
limited
to
prohibition
of
advertising
directed
at
consumers,
as
opposed
to
advertising
directed
at
doctors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
you
have
large
companies
as
clients.
is
it
lawful,
or
is
it
part
of
the
practice
to
compound
a
large
volume,
have
an
inventory
available
that
you
then
can
advertise
to
the
doctors,
consumers
that
if
you
prescribe
it,
we
will
sell
it
to
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
that
part
of
the
practice
that
they
follow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
view
of
the
case,
it
would
be
perfectly
permissible
for
them,
if
they
can
anticipate
a
large
volume
of
sales
of
a
particularly
tailor-made
compound,
they
could
store
up
a
huge
inventory
and
then
market
it
later?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
based
on
a
prediction
of
what
the
doctors
will
prescribe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry,
it's
not
5a
of
the
petition.
5a
of
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--85a,
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
difficulty
with
saying
it's
so
infrequent,
on
the
one
hand,
and
you
want
to
engage
in
national
advertising
on
the
other
hand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
it's
so
infrequently
used,
but
then
you
say
you
want
the
right
to
advertise
nationally.

the
definition

applies
equally
to
manufacturing
and
compounding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
definition
in

is
a
definition
of
the

manufacturing,
preparation,
propagation,
compounding
or
processing.
justice
john

it
describes
them
in
the
same
definition.
