mr.
kneedler,
would
you
explain
something
to
me?
going
back
before
the
point
where...
everybody
seems
to
agree
that
compounding
and
manufacturing
is
no
different,
but
there
once
was
a
world
when
there
were
mostly
corner
pharmacists,
and
there
was
something
called
compounding
which
surely
was
discrete
from
manufacturing,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
described
as
an
exemption
for
the
compounding
was
the
first
time
that
compounding
is
put
together
with
new
manufactured
new
drugs.
before
the
1997
alteration,
how
was
compounding
dealt
with
by
the
fda?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
mean,
there's
two
kinds
of
compounding.
let's
just
say,
it's
the
physician
who's
prescribing
this
medication
for
a
child,
so
it
needs
to
be
diluted,
pharmacist-diluted,
is
that
manufacturing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hoffman,
in
doing
that,
would
you
take
into
account
what
mr.
kneedler
told
us
this
morning,
because
i
put
the
question
to
him,
what
is
the
difference,
and
he
said,
the
government's
position
is,
compounding
is
a
form
of
making
a
new
drug,
that
everything
fits
under
the
new
drug,
and
that
this
section
is
designed
to
allow
a
limited
kind
of
new
drug-making.
in
other
words,
you
are
telling
us
that
there
are
two
categories,
compounding
and
manufacturing.
the
government
is
saying,
there
are
new
drugs
and,
by
the
grace
of
congress,
we're
allowing
some
of
those
new
drugs
to
escape
the
full
process.
now,
you
have
told
us
in
your
brief
that
there's
a
bright
line
between
compounding
and
manufacturing.
in
telling
us
what
that
bright
line
is,
will
you
also
say
how
you
respond
to
the
government
that
says,
we
define
everything
as
a
new
drug?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hoffman,
perhaps
i've
deflected
you
before,
but
you
were
going
to
tell
us
something
about
this
bright
line
between
what's
a
manufactured
drug
and
what's
a
compounded
drug.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
how
do
we
tell
whether
one
is
a
compound
and
whether
it's
a
new
drug?
