mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
has
long
been
a
fundamental
requirement
of
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
that
a
new
drug
may
not
be
marketed
unless
it
has
first
been
found
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
be
safe
and
effective
for
its
intended
use.
congress
concluded
that
the
protection
of
the
public
health
requires
that
safety
and
effectiveness
be
rigorously
established
by
scientifically
valid
studies
rather
than
the
impressions
of
individual
doctors,
and
also
that
persons
who
promote
and
distribute
new
drugs
should
be
the
ones
to
undertake
the
studies
necessary
to
establish
their
safety
effectiveness.
in
1997,
congress
carved
out
a
narrow
exception
to
the
new
drug
approval
and
certain
other
requirements
of
the
food
and
drug
act
for
certain
compounding
by
pharmacists.
the
exemption
is
addressed
to
what
is
often
referred
to
as
extemporaneous
compounding.
that
is,
compounding
undertaken
in
response
to
a
physician's
prescription
based
on
the
idiosyncratic
needs
of
a
particular
patient.
such
compounding
is
typically
based
on
an
existing
relationship
among
the
pharmacist,
physician,
and
patient.
congress
provided
in
section
353(a),
which
it
enacted
in
1997,
that
the
exemptions
from
the
new
drug
approval
and
other
requirements
of
the
act
would
be
limited,
and
available
only
in
circumstances
that
conformed
to
extemporaneous
compounding
by
pharmacists.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
it's
based
on
the
relationship.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
typically
an
existing
relationship
in
the
sense
that
the
need
for
compounding
often
arises
where
there
may
be
a
commercially
available
product
that
maybe
the
physician
has
prescribed,
but
it
might...
or
would
have
otherwise
prescribed,
but
it
might
contain
an
ingredient
to
which
the
patient
is
allergic,
or
it
may
come
in
a
dosage
that
would
be
inappropriate
for
a
child
or
an
older
person,
and
therefore
the
physician
and
the
pharmacist
would
consult
and
say,
the
pharmacist
would
be
asked,
could
you
modify
this
in
some
way,
or
develop
the
same
drug
without
the
ingredient,
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it
is...
and
the
record
in
the
case,
the
materials
submitted
in
the
district
court,
confirm
exactly
what
you
say.
this
is
far
different
from
that
sort
of
situation.
they're
engaging
in
conduct
that
is
essentially
indistinguishable
from
that
of
any
manufacturer
or
producer
of
drug
products
that
is
governed
by
the
manufacturing--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
that's
exactly
what
congress
has
done.
if
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
i
could
explain,
the
ban
on
advertising
is
one
of
the
conditions
that
confine
the
exemption
to
traditional
extemporaneous
compounding.
the
others
are,
for
example,
that
it
has
to
be
on
the
basis
of
an
unsolicited
prescription,
that
the
drug
can't
be
prepared
in
advance
of
the
prescription
except
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
condition
is
essential
to
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
new
drug
approval
process,
for
this
reason.
the
general
rule
under
this
act
is
that
the
introduction
of
any
new
drug
in
interstate
commerce
must
conform
with
the
prior
approval
requirements
of
the
food
and
drug
act.
this
is
a
narrow
exception
from
that,
but
what
congress
had
to
do
was
draw
the
line
between
what
is
extemporaneous
compounding
and
what
is
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
first
of
all,
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
really
misunderstood
what
the
governmental
interest
here...
the...
is
here.
the
governmental
interest,
again,
is
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
government
approval
process
and
making
sure
that
those
who
hold
themselves
out
as
marketers
and
distributors
of
new
drugs
comply
with
those
requirements
in
the
same
way
that
any
other
manufacturer
must
do.
the
mixing
together
of
ingredients--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
that's
not
really
the
basic
point
behind
this.
again,
no
one,
whether
he
holds
a
pharmacist's
license,
a
physician's
license,
or
not,
may
manufacture
and
market
drugs
in
this
economy
without
going
through
the
prior
approval
requirement,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
that's
a
very
important
point.
there
is
nothing
distinctive
about
a
pharmacist
putting
together
ingredients
to
produce
a
new
drug
as
compared
with
a
traditional
manufacturer.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
what
distinguishes
it
is
that
congress
carved
out
a
narrow
exception,
is
the
existence
of
this
relationship
between
the
pharmacist,
among
the
pharmacist,
the
physician,
and
the
patient.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it...
what
it
equates
with
is
the
marketing
of
products
in
the
economy,
and
this
is
not
the
only
situation
under
the
food
and
drug
act
where
the
advertising
that
someone
does
is
what
triggers
regulation.
this
court
last
term
in
the
buckman
decision
addressed
a
very
analogous
situation,
and
if
i
could
explain
why
it's
analogous,
i
think
it
would
be
instructive
here.
there,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
fda
is
faced
with
competing
considerations.
on
the
one
hand
there
is
a
rigorous
premarket
approval
process
for,
in
that
case,
devices,
which
is
very
analogous
to
the
rigorous
new
drug
approval
process
for
drugs,
but
the
court
at
the
same
time
recognized
that
it
is
permissible
for
physicians
to
prescribe
for
off-label
uses,
physicians,
but
if
a
manufacturer
of
the
drug
advertises
the
product
for
a
use
that
is
not
on
the
label,
that
is
prohibited.
what
someone
cannot
do
is
market
in
the
economy
a
drug
for
an
intended
use
that
is
not
on
the
label,
because
in
that
situation,
as
here,
congress
was
trying
to
draw
the
line
between
marketing
of
drugs
and
protection
of
profession--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
what
it
is,
it's
an
equation
of
advertising
with
what
triggers
the,
in
that
case
the
prior
approval
process
and
in
this
case
the
prior
approval
process.
when
someone
holds
himself
out
as
producing
and
distributing
drugs,
then
it
is
fair
to
make
that
person,
like
every
other
manufacturer
that
distributes
drugs
in
the
national
economy
comply.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
fda
had
taken
the
position
for
quite
a
while
before
the
1997
amendments
of
at
least
two
decades
that
pharmacy
compounding,
at
least
if
it
included
such
an
indicia
of
manufacturing
as
advertising,
or
large
volumes,
a
number
of
things
that
take
it
out
of
traditional
pharmacy
compounding,
extemporaneous,
and
put
it
into
the
basically
predetermined
or
planned
marketing
of
a
product,
that's
the
line
congress
is
trying
to
draw.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
would
be
producing
a
new
drug
within
the
meaning
of
the
new
drug
provisions
of
the
act,
it
would
have
been
prior
to
1997.
the
position
that
fda...
fda
formalized
its
enforcement
policy
in
1992
to
say
that
compounding
that
occurs
in
the
normal
course,
the
ordinary
course
of
the
practice
of
pharmacy,
extemporaneous
compounding
that
you've
described
to
dilute
a
commercially
available
product,
or
to
extract
an
ingredient
from
it,
that
would
be
all
right,
but
when
the
pharmacist
stepped
out
of
that
role
and
behaved
in
ways
that
a
regular
producer
of
drugs
subject
to
the
act
behaves,
then
the
person
is
subject
to
the
prior
approval,
good
manufacturing
practices
requirements
of
the
act,
because
again,
in
terms
of
function,
putting
together
different
ingredients
to
produce
a
product,
whether
it's
a
manufacturer,
or
whether
it
is
someone
with
a
pharmacy
license
doing
it,
that
doesn't
matter,
and
the
important
public
health
considerations--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--several
things
in
response
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
new
drug
provisions
of
the
act
are
directed
at
single
incidents
of
introducing
a
new
drug
into
interstate
commerce,
or
a
single
incident
of
receiving
this
branded
drug
in
interstate
commerce,
so
the
act
applies
irrespective
of
the
volume.
now,
obviously
the
magnitude
of
the
public
health
problem
expands
as
more
and
more
people
are
affected,
but
advertising,
along
with
the
other
conditions
congress
put
in
the
act,
were
a
pretty
good
indication
of
trying
to
draw
a
distinction
between
traditional
pharmacy
and
what
the
fda--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it's
based
on
the
undertaking
by
the
person
who
is
producing,
who
is
trying
to
put
the
drug
out
on
the
market.
it's
really
a
difference
between
offering
services
and
offering
drugs.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
would
certainly
lead
to
those
consequences.
my
point
is,
though,
that
the
line
congress
drew
is
not
at
a
particular
volume.
it
looked
at
the
traditional
operation
of
the
act,
which
prohibits
individual
instances
of
introducing
drugs--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i...
well,
with
all
respect,
what
the
pharmacist
can
do
is
advertise
his
services,
his
professional
services,
and
what
the
act
does...
this
exemption
in
the
act
does
is,
respect
that
professional
service
and
the
relationship
that
grows
out
of
that
professional
service.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
what
that
does
is
conform
to
the
line
congress
was
trying
to
draw.
it
allows
the
advertising
of
the
services,
but
it
does
not
allow
the
advertising
and
therefore
the
attempt
to
develop
a
market
for
a
particular
product,
or
drug.
again,
the
federal
act
is
concerned
with
promoting
drugs,
not
services,
so
when
you
hold
yourself
out
as
someone
who
says,
i
will
sell
drugs...
and
if
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
the
plaintiffs
have
advertising
that
lists
a
whole
variety
of
drugs
available
for
infertility,
for
cancer,
for
things
like
that.
they
are
behaving
just
like
any
manufacturer,
any...
just
like
exactly
the
sorts
of
persons
that
the
new
drug
approval
and
the
good
manufacturing
practice
provisions
of
the
act
were
designed
to
reach.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
exactly
right,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
fda
was
referring
to
and
others
have
referred
to
as
extemporaneous
compounding.
it
arises
out
of
the
relationship,
so
congress...
in
carving
out
this
exemption,
congress
was
doing
a
number
of
things.
it
was
looking
at
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the...
it
doesn't
prohibit
the
availability
of
the
advertising
services,
which
can
include,
we
can
prepare
a
product
to
remove
something
to
which
a
patient
may
be
allergic.
we
can
compound
a
product--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but
it...
what
it
can
do,
though,
is
advertise
in
general
terms
that
it
can
remove,
or
it
can
produce
a
product
that
is
like
a
commercial
one,
but
while
removing
ingredients
to
which
the
person
may
be
allergic,
or
dilute
a
dosage.
that
is
enough
to
get
the
critical
information--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
and
i
think
the
most
critical
thing
that
tells
us
that
is
the
new
drug
approval
provisions
of
the
food
and
drug
act
itself,
which
congress
enacted
in
1938
and
strengthened
in
1962
precisely
to
reach
the
conduct
of
people
developing
new
drugs
and
advertising
and
promoting
drugs
that
have
not
been
shown
to
be
safe
and
effective
to
individuals
or
to
the
public
at
large.
it
is
the
act
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the
new
drug
approval
provisions
of
the
food
and
drug
act
rest
on
the
premise
that
the
judgment
of
the
individual
physician
is
not
sufficient.
that
is
the
very
purpose
of
requiring
prior
approval
and
requiring
the
person
who
wants
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
one
variation,
but
again,
if
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
there
are
products
that
have
been
compounded
that
don't
resemble
that
at
all.
what
they
are,
are
people
holding
themselves
out
as
pharmacists
who
really
see
themselves
as
developing
new
cures,
not
just
tinkering
with
an
existing
product,
but
putting--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
well,
not...
it
would
revert
to
the
situation
before,
in
which
this
would
be
absolutely
prohibited.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
fda
would
have
the
discretion,
and
again
it's
not
just
mass
marketing,
it
is
the
situation,
as
justice
breyer
described,
of
where
the
demand
comes
from,
and...
but
more
fundamentally,
the
act
rests
on
the
notion
that
it
is
fair
to
require
people
who
hold
themselves
out
and
who
attempt
to
develop
and
exploit
a
market
to
go
through
the
new
drug
approval
requirements.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
you
make
an
important
point,
because
congress
looked
at
this
problem
in
1997
and,
as
the
committee
reports
we
quote
show,
it
consulted
broadly
about
this
and
arrived
at
a
consensus
about
exactly
where
this
dividing
line
should
be
between
extemporaneous
traditional
compounding
and
the
traditional
kind
of
promotion
of
new
drugs
that
the
act
was
directed
to.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
this
case--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
central
hudson
doctrine
that
this
court
has
developed
for
evaluating
restrictions
on
commercial
speech,
its
virtue
is
that
it
allows
the
recognition
of
these
very
real
problems
that
regulatory
agencies
face.
again,
it's
exactly
the
sort
of
balance
the
court
was
addressing
in
buckman
last
term
between
respecting
the
integrity
and
creating
incentives
for
producers
to
go
through
the
new
drug
approval
process
on
the
one
hand,
but
respecting
professional
services,
existing
relationships
on
the
other,
and
under
the
central
hudson
analysis,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
we
think
this
statute
easily
passes
muster,
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
new
drug
approval
process,
and
maintaining
incentives
for
manufacturers
to
go
through
it
is
clearly,
in
our
view,
a
substantial
governmental
interest.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i...
again,
the
new
drug
approval
process
of
the
act
rests
on
the
premises
that
doctors
themselves
cannot
make
independent
judgments
about
the
safety
and
effectiveness
of
products,
and
that
is...
that
was
a
very
firm
understanding
of
congress
when
it
passed
the
new
drug
approval
process.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the
paradigm
that
the
act
was
directed
to
is
where
there
is
an
approved
new
drug
product,
or
an
approved
product
on
the
market,
and
what
the
pharmacist
is
being
asked
to
do
is
tinker
with
it
a
little
bit
by
diluting
it,
by
something
on
that
order,
to
make
it...
to
adjust
it
but
not
be
in
the
business
of
developing
new
cures,
or
advertising
new
cures
for
existing
diseases.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
volume
restriction
is
on
the
aggregate
number
of
compounded
drugs.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
a
drug
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--a
drug-by-drug
volume
restriction
would
be
extraordinarily
difficult
to
administer,
with
thousands
and
thousands
of
pharmacies
across
the
country,
and
having
to
keep
track
of
particular
patient's
names--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--again,
congress,
we
think,
was
entitled
to
look
at
the
conduct
of
the
pharmacist
and
take
the
pharmacist
at
his
word.
if
he
stops
being
a
pharmacist--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
under--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
the
restrictions
on
volume
is
directed
at
the
overall
character
of
the
pharmacist.
the
restriction
on
the
solicitation
and
advertising
of
a
particular
product
is
exactly
what
the
food
and
drug
act
is
directed
at,
which
is
the
promotion
of
a
new
drug,
not
just
a
volume,
but
a
new
drug,
and
congress
was
specifically
concerned
about
that
as
well.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
here
was
to
make
sure
that
the
narrow
exemption
that
it
intended
did
not
swallow
the
critical
general
rule
that
new
drugs
have
to
be
submitted
to
prior
approval.
the
question
of
volume
limitations
has
been
raised.
the
act
contains
an
aggregate
volume
limitation
but,
as
i
mentioned,
individual
drug-by-drug
volume
limitations
would
be
very
difficult
to
administer,
and
congress
was
not
required
to
go
down
that
path,
but
an
additional
point
about
that
is
that
if
you
look...
if
you
add
up
a
couple
of
prescriptions
by
each
pharmacy,
nation-wide
you
will
be
talking
about
a
pretty
large
volume
of
a
new
drug,
which
is
precisely
the
sort
of
thing
that
should
be
submitted
to
the
fda
for
prior
approval.
the
act
does
not
just
prohibit
manufacturing
new
drugs,
it
prohibits
the
introduction
in
interstate
commerce
of
new
drugs.
it
isn't
just
focused
on
large
volumes,
it's
focused
on
individual
instances.
so
are
the
misbranding
and
adulteration
provisions
of
the
act.
the
line
congress
drew
here
that
includes
solicitation
and
advertising
among
the
conditions
was
not
invented
in
1997.
in
case
law
it
goes
all
the
way
back
to
1978
in
the
cedars
case
we
mentioned
in
the
brief,
where
the
court
there
was
trying
to
define
the
scope
of
the
express
exemption
for
pharmacy
in
registration
and
inspections,
and
among
the
factors
it
says
when
someone
steps
out
of
the
traditional
pharmacy
role
was,
do
they
engage
in
promotion
of
the
product.
the
definition
also
appears
in
the
model
rules
of
good
pharmacy
practice
of
the
state
of
the
national
association
of
state
boards
of
pharmacy,
which
says
that
pharmacists
should
not
solicit
or
advertise
compounded
drugs.
all
of
this
represents
a
general
understanding
that
compounding
by
pharmacists
has
to
be
contemporaneous
and
responsive--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
what
he
is
supposed--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
pharmacist
holds
himself
out
as
having
pharmacy
services
and
expertise,
and
that's
where
the
promotion
of
the
consultation
and
the
professional
relationship--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
the
pharmacist
can
advertise
that
he
engages
in
the
pharmacy
services.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
has
to
ask.
under
respondent's
theory,
a
pharmacist,
someone
holding
a
pharmacist
license
presumably
could
promote
laetrile,
or
could
promote
prozac
and
advertise
it
to
the
market
at
large,
and
congress
certainly
did
not
expect
that
sort
of
thing.
