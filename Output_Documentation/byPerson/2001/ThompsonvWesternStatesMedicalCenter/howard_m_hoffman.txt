mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
in
response
to
some
of
the
court's
questions
i
would
like
to
give
our
position,
the
respondents
position
and
a
couple
of
key
points
on
which
there
may
yet
be
some
confusion,
and
i
start
with
the
proposition
of
why
a
compounding
pharmacist
is
not
a
manufacturer,
which
seems
to
be
a
key
point
before
this
court
this
morning,
and
i
can
understand
why.
let
me
address
what
it
is
the
manufacturer
does,
how
he
does
it,
and
what
a
compounding
pharmacist
does,
and
i
will
also
say
that
there
are
in
these
respondents
specialty
compounding
entities
so
that
when
the
court
was
concerned
about,
they
sell
their
compounds
nation-wide,
they
dispense
them
nation-wide,
indeed,
some
of
them
do,
and
that's
because
they
happen
to
specialize
in
compounding,
and
do
that
as
a
special
service,
specializing
in
the
interaction,
as
part
of
their
triad,
where
they
work
with
patients,
they
work
with
the
specialist
physician
to,
for
example,
treat
cancers,
treat
tumors--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--yes,
your
honor.
it
is...
in
fact,
it's
in
the
affidavits
in
the
lower
court
and
the
verified
complaints.
they
work
as
part
of
this
triad,
they
are
specialists,
and
they
work
with
infertility
specialists,
for
example,
for
the
purpose
of
helping
childless
couples
be
able
to
have
children.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
all
that
is
lawful,
and
all--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--that
is
not
what
they
do,
except
to
this
limited
extent,
and
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court.
yes,
these
compounding
pharmacists
do
not
compound
in
advance
before
getting
prescription
orders
vast
inventories.
if
that
was
the
court's
question,
the
answer
is
yes,
they
do
not.
however,
do
they
not
at
all
pre-compound
some
inventory,
and
the
answer
is
yes,
they
do,
because
under
state
laws
and
under
the
practice
of
pharmacy
as
it
is
developed,
if
they
know
that
there
is,
for
a
certain
compound,
a
historical
ordering
pattern,
a
week--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
my
concern
is
with
the
word,
huge
inventory.
if
the
inventory
is
merely
based
upon
a
week,
or--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--over
the
next
week
or
two,
yes.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
mostly
shelf
life,
and
we
don't
know
how
long
in
advance
this
particular
compound--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--no,
we
don't
know
that,
but
we
don't
want
to
go
further
than
a
week
or
2
weeks
for
the
sake
of
erring
on
the
side
of
safety.
we
don't
need
to
do
that,
we
don't
want
to
do
that,
and
that's
not
what
we
do.
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
impression
we
stockpile
huge
inventory
amounts,
because
we
don't.
we
just
do
enough
where
there's
a
series
of
patients
that
are
now
under
that
treatment
to
once
compound
it
for
that
1
or
2-week
period
if
we
know
those
kinds
of
refill
orders
are
going
to
be
coming
back
in
again.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
i'm
sorry,
it
would
allow
no
what?
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
first,
we
will
revert
back
to
the
pre-fdama
area,
whatever
that
was.
the
government
now
maintains
that
this
compounding
practice,
under
all
circumstances,
as
they
say
at
page
18
of
their
opening
brief,
was
always
illegal.
we
strongly
disagree
with
that.
we
also
believe
that
it's
not
an
issue
before
this
case
because
it
wasn't
preserved,
but
to
the
extent
the
court
wants
to
know
about
it,
there
are
innumerable
provisions
in
both
title
21,
which
clearly
indicate
that
compounds
are
not
new
drugs.
the
government
itself
acknowledges,
even
under
fdama,
it
would
not,
and
it
is
not
able
to
submit
compounds
for
pre-market
approval,
because
of
the
extemporaneous
numbers
in
which
the
need
for
them
arises.
i
really
want
to
go
back,
if
i
may,
to
manufacturing
versus
compounding,
and
that
we
somehow
confuse
the
fact
that
once
a
volume
reaches
a
certain
level,
it's
suddenly
manufacturing
and
not
compounding,
and
that
isn't
the
case
at
all,
and
let
me
explain
why,
and
by
the
way,
these
are
distinctions
that
are
both
covered
in
section
360(a)(1)...
at
least
one
of
them
is...
in
title
21
of
the
united
states
code,
and
also
in
the
state
statutes
governing
pharmacy,
and
regulating
pharmacy
of
each
of
the
several
states.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
and
to
address
that,
your
honor,
we
turn
to
21
united
states
code,
section
321(p)(1),
which
defines
a
new
drug,
and
the
government
talks
about--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--it's
cited
in
the
briefs.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
it's
referenced
in
the
briefs.
it's
in
roman
ii
of
our
response
brief,
321(p)(1).
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
just
the
reference.
it's
the
citation.
the
text
is
not
in
the
brief.
mr.
kneedler
has
it.
where
is
it
from?
it's
in
section
5(a)
of
the
petition.
thank
you.
and
your
honor,
on
that,
under
that
it
says
that
new
drugs
need
to
be
submitted
for
testing
to
be
generally
recognized
for
safety
and
efficacy.
the
government
acknowledges
throughout,
in
all
the
pleadings
in
this
case,
in
all
the--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--it's
on
page
5...
i'm
sorry,
85a.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
and
in
that
section
it
talks
about
submitting
to
the
fda
for
pre-market
approval
testing
to
determine
safety
and
efficacy.
throughout,
in
the
government's
briefs,
the
government's
briefs
acknowledge
that
that
is
not
possible
for
compounds.
compounds
are
incapable
of
being
treated
as
new
drugs,
and
that
is
because
they
appear
so
infrequently
that
you
can't
get
a
statistical
data
base
to
determine
to
the
scientific
certainty--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
let
us
also
talk
about
the
national
advertising
that
we
allegedly
do,
and
i
don't...
i
think
i
will
come
back
to
respond
to
the
court's
question.
i
hope
i
do.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
but
the
government
keeps
asserting
that
what
we
are
advertising
is
finished
products,
and
they
try
to
impress
upon
the
court,
which
is
absolutely
untrue,
that
the
finished
product
sits
on
shelves
waiting
to
be
shipped
out
in
bulk
to
individuals
or
to
middle
people.
that's
just
not
what
we
do.
the
advertising
we
do
is
to
tell
mostly
the
scientific
community,
nurses,
medical
care
providers,
mostly
physicians,
and
at
that
special
physicians--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--and
to
patients,
yes,
that
there
are
ingredients
that
are
capable
of
being
compounded,
and
then
in
working
with
the
physician,
a
mixture
of
ingredients,
together
with
the
inactive
ingredients,
will
be
compounded
into
a
delivery
format
that's
best
suitable
for
a
patient,
be
it
a
suppository
form,
an
injectable
form,
an
oral
form,
a
pill,
a
patch
form,
et
cetera.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
it
is
specific
in
the
ingredients
that
we
list
as
being
capable
of
being
put
into
a
compound
suitable
for
a
particular
patient.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
it
will
lead
to
a
particular
compound
in
a
particular
dosage,
worked
out
together
between
the
pharmacist,
the
patient,
and
the
physician--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--we're
getting
into
classes
of
drugs,
and
we're
getting--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--and
if
there
are
classes
of
patients
that
require
those
classes
of
drugs,
physicians
do
not
know,
always,
what
is
available
for
their
particular
patient,
and
they
have
to--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--correct.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
and
we
do
not
mass
manufacture,
and
for
some
reason...
i
apologize
terribly
that
i'm
not
making
that
point,
because
let
me
explain
what
we
do
do.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
correct.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
that's
correct,
and
given
what
the
government-asserted
interests
are,
that
is
to
protect
public
safety,
through
theoretically
ineffective
and
unsafe
drugs,
then
the
ban
on
advertising
doesn't
do
that
at
all.
in
fact,
fdama
had
in
it
the
laudable
sections
which
would
have,
in
fact,
been
specifically
addressed,
which
until
the
ninth
circuit
were
still
a
part
of
fdama,
only
the
advertising
ban
until
then
hadn't
been
held
unconstitutional.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
well,
it
seems
to
be,
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
a
most
inappropriate
way
to
address
demand,
by
withholding
truthful
information
from
patients
and
physicians
who
might
benefit
from
that.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
there
are
many
wrongs
with
that,
and
let
me
explain.
first
of
all,
it
denigrates
the
role
of
the
pharmacist.
it
assumes
that
there's
not
a
dialogue
that
commences,
for
example,
with
the
pharmacist.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
correct.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
and
the
government
won't
even
change
that,
their
intent
of
reducing
volume
theoretically
is
to
protect
widespread--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--right,
and
at
the
end
of
the
day,
before
any
drug
can
be
dispensed,
the
physician
has
to
write
a
prescription,
he
has
to
approve
it,
and
it
makes
no
difference
at
which
end
of
the
spectrum
it
commences,
because
it
always
ends
up
with
the
physician.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
what's
the
harm
in
the
patient
going
to
the
physician?
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
there
are
innumerable
opportunities
to
preserve
and
protect
the
public
safety
without
resorting
to
first
amendment
restriction.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
i
did
not
hear,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
and
it's
not
just--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--that
is
correct.
first
of
all--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--and
it
is
not
just
advertising.
it
is
even
the
promotion
and
solicitation.
as
the
lower
court
pointed
out...
i
think
it
was
the
ninth
circuit,
i
forget
which,
where
it
did
not
find
or
understand
the
rationale
for
why
the
patient
or
the
doctor
would
have
to
ask
the
critical
question,
what's
the
best
thing
for
this
patient,
or
what's
the
best
thing
for
me,
because
they
would
first
have
to
ask
the
question.
and
the
whole
concept
of
promotion
and
solicitation...
forget
about
just
advertising.
advertising
conjures
up
a
specific
type
of
sales
provoking
television
ad,
billboard
ads,
but
pharmacists,
as
part
of
the
canon
of
their
ethics,
is
required
as
a
professional,
as
part
of
the
triad,
who
is
not
just
a
passive
order-taker,
who
doesn't
just
count
out
and
push
pills,
but
a
person
who
plays
a
scientific
role
in
the
context,
he
has
to
be
able
to
on
his
own
speak
out
and
say,
consistent
with
the
canons
of
his
professions,
this
is
better
for
you.
this
is
what
the
doctor
brought
in.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
i--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--we
do.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
it
is...
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
it
is
not,
and
let
me
explain
why.
we
have
the
same
patient
profiles
in
our
records,
notwithstanding
that
there
may
be
a
half-a-country
separating
patient
and
pharmacist.
we
have
800
numbers
that
the
patients
call
in
on,
just
as
you
would
call
to
a
local
pharmacist.
the
only
thing
that
is
different
is,
there's
a
little
bit
more
distance.
it
may
take
an
extra
day
or
half-day
to
get
the
prescription
out
there,
but
that
intimacy
in
the
relationship
via
the
patient
profiles,
via
the
ability
to
consult,
is
the
same
with
these
pharmacists
as
it
is
with
the
corner
druggist,
if
you
will.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
under
federal
statute,
for
example,
manufacturing
is
defined
as
distribution
to
someone
other
than
the
ultimate
consumer,
and
that's
found
in
21
united
states
code,
section
360(a)(1).
360(a)(1)
defines
manufacturing
as
distribution
to
a
middle
man,
or
a
distributor,
or
a
wholesale...
wholesaler,
so
right
away,
the
first
distinction
is
the
pharmacist
only
dispenses
directly
to
the
patient
in
the
context
of
the
triad.
he's
available
for
consultation,
he
gives
directions
on
use,
he
has
the
patient
profile
on
his
records.
he
knows
what
drug
interactions
there
may
or
may
not
be
with
this
particular
drug
and
this
particular
patient.
second
of
all...
and,
of
course,
the
manufacturer
doesn't
do
that,
having
no
relationship
with
the
physician,
having
no
relationship
with
the
patient.
in
addition
to
that,
they
do,
manufacturers
do
a
one-size-fits-all
type
of
product.
they
have
determined
that
there
is
this
vast,
multimillion
person
individual
need
for
a
particular
drug,
and
they
fit
that
niche,
and
they
play
to
it,
and
they
market
to
it,
and
they
manufacture
for
it,
unlike--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
then
i
may
have--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--i
may
have
mis-cited.
then
it's
368,
but
it
talks
about
manufacturing,
and
i
apologize
that
i
don't
have
that
number.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
correct.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
and
the
other
section
will
be
section
374(a)(2).
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
374...
actually,
it's
374(2),
or
360(g)(2).
they're
identical.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
your
honor,
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
have
the
reference
cites
here.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
no.
what
i
said
was,
it
defines
new
drugs,
and
under
a
new
drug,
it
has
to
be
capable
of
being
submitted
to
the
fda's
new
drug
process.
the
government--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--no,
but
by--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--that's
correct.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
it
is
not
a
problem.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
we
would
be
delighted--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--because
it
talks
about
drugs
that
are
capable
of
being
submitted,
and
the
government
itself
acknowledges
that
we
cannot
submit
compounds
for
new
drug
approval--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--but
how
can
it
be
a
new
drug
that
cannot
be
tested?
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
right.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
no.
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
i
really
think--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--but
you
have
to
read
it
into...
the
word...
it
does
not
use
the
words,
capable
of.
it
says...
it
says,
has
to
be--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--it...
what
i
was
referring
to
is,
any
drug
which
is
not
generally
recognized
among
experts,
qualified
by
science
as
safe
and
effective,
the
case
law
under
that
determines
that
in
order
to
determine
safety
and
efficacy,
the
drug
has
to
be
submitted
to
this
exhaustive
fda
free
market
approval
process.
the
government
acknowledges
that
that
costs
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars.
it
also
requires,
as
case
law
identifies,
a
huge
data
base
from
which
to
be
able
to
draw
and
determine
the
safety
and
effect...
efficacy,
none
of
which
can
be
done
for--
mr.
howard
m.
hoffman
--okay,
because
there
would
have
been
ways
to
make
compounds
safe
and
effective,
and
these
ways
would
have
been...
and
they
were
in
fdama
until
they
were
held
not
severable
by
the
ninth
circuits,
and
this
was
the
use
of
ingredients
that
appear
in
the
pharmacopeia.
we
took
no
quarrel
with
that.
that
seemed
to
be
something
that
addressed
the
safety
of
the
public.
it
also
required
that
the
secretary
prepare
some
lists.
one
of
them
was,
if
there
was
an
ingredient
that
was
necessary
for
compounding,
the
secretary
could
be
petitioned...
i'm
sorry,
if
there
was
an
ingredient
necessary
that
didn't
appear
in
the
pharmacopeia,
the
secretary
could
be
petitioned
to
put
onto
that
list
something
that
the
secretary
would
determine
was
safe
and
effective.
if
there
was
something
that
was
established
that
was
not
safe
and
effective
for
compounding,
fdama
included
a
list
to
be
prepared
by
the
secretary
to
forbid
these
kinds
of
products
to
be
used
as
ingredients
in
compounding.
compounding
would
have
to
be
done
by
licensed
physicians.
it
would
have
to
be
done
by
licensed
pharmacists.
these
were
all
the
conduct-specific
related
regulations
that
one
would
applaud,
that
congress
has
a
right
to
do.
but
to
try
to
reduce
the
demand,
and
try
to
keep
truthful
information
by
restrictions
on
first
amendment
is,
this
is
what's
offensive
about
that
part
of
fdama.
we
didn't
seek
to
have
the
conduct-related
provisions
stricken,
and
in
fact
it
was
the
government
that
it,
itself
put
it
in,
then
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
said,
well,
we
can't
have
the
first
amendment
restriction,
we
don't
want
the
others,
either.
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
when
it
comes
to
manufacturing,
manufacturing,
going
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
we
sell
it
retail,
they
sell
it
wholesale.
we
sell
pursuant
to
a
prescription.
they
sell
just
to
a
middle
man
distributor.
we
provide
consultation.
there
is
no
consultation
when
it
comes
to
a
manufacturer.
there's
also,
on
this
issue
of
widespreadedness,
the
degree,
or
the
volume
concern.
first
of
all,
we
can
only
dispense,
and
we
routinely
only
prepare
upon
receipt
of
a
pharmacist's...
of
a
physician's
prescription,
but
in
addition
to
that,
if
volume
were
such
a
concern,
there
was
unlimited
intrastate
transportation
allowed,
dispensing
of
pharmaceuticals,
so
i
seriously
question,
for
example,
whether
or
not
they
even...
fdama
even
addressed
adequately
the
volumes,
the
volume
restrictions
it
was
trying
to
impose.
also,
for
example,
positron
emissions
compounding,
and
radiopharmaceutical
compounding
were
exempted
from
the
operation
of
fdama,
so
that
potentially
the
most
lethal,
most
dangerous
of
all
the
compounds
could
be
advertised,
promoted,
solicited,
and
no
pharmacopeia
ingredients
could
have
been
used
for
them.
they
also
provided
for
industry
transportation
in
the
event
of
a
memorandum
of
understanding.
up
to
20
percent
of
the
total
pharmaceutical
sales
by
that
pharmacy
could
be
shipped
intrastate,
so
that
if,
for
example,
there
were
five
compounding
pharmacists
in
a
state,
they
could
fill
100
percent
of
the
outside...
of
the
out-of-state
demand,
so
at
the
end
of
the
day,
as
in
greater
new
orleans,
this
case...
i'm
sorry,
this
statute
was
so
riddled
with
exemptions...
with
exceptions
that
undermined
the
government's
own
very
purpose,
that
it
would
fail
just
because
it
was
simply
irrational.
as
the
court
pointed
out
already,
it
is
irrational
to
suggest
that
only
speech
that's
provoked
by
the
physician
can
be
unregulated,
whereas
the
same
speech
in
the
context
of
a
professional
relationship
as
provoked
by
the
pharmacist,
then
somehow
it
becomes
unconstitutional.
in
the
lower
court
we
pointed
out
the
following.
that
means
under
this
statute
a
pharmacist
would
have
to
have
a
little
sign
on
his
counter.
on
this
little
sign
it
would
say,
please
ask
me
to
tell
you
what
i
think
you
should
know,
but
because
of
fdama,
i,
under
restrictions
on
advertising,
promotion,
solicitation,
am
forbidden
from
telling
you.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
shall
conclude.
