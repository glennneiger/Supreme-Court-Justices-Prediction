we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
01-344,
tommy
g.
thompson
v.
the
western
states
medical
center.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
a
moment
ago
you
say
this
is
based
on
an
existing
relationship
between
the
physician,
the
druggist,
and
the
patient.
what
is
meant
by
that
term?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
could
tell
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
plaintiffs
here
seem
to
be
engaged
in
a
nation-wide
business.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they're
not
a
corner--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hoffman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hoffman,
i
take
it
all
of
this
is
in
the
record
somewhere.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
it
limited
to
the
next
week
or
two?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
shelf
life
of
some
of
these
drugs
is
only
a
week?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know,
you
say
the
national
advertising
that
you
allegedly
do,
well,
there's
an
allegation
in
your
complaint
which
i
presume
you
don't
really
want
to
abandon,
that
advertising
and
promotion
essential
to
do
business
in
a
market
national
in
scope,
and
to
inform
physicians
and
patients
of
availability
and
benefits
of
the
special
class,
specific
classes
and
types
of
drugs
the
plaintiff
compounds.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
in
your
complaint,
you
add
patients,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
advertising
ban
is
surely
devoted
to
keeping
demand
down,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it's
a
little
less
chummy
than
you
make
it
sound,
i
think,
judging
from
your
complaint.
you
have
seven
clients.
they
dispense
in
interstate
commerce
5
percent
of
their
total
sales,
which
amounts
to
60
or
95
percent
of
their
total
sales
in
another
capacity,
and
you
sell
all
over
the
country,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
your
portrait
of
the
intimate
relationship
between
the
pharmacist
and
the
doctor
i
think
is
a
little,
perhaps,
overblown.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
these?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
page
are
you
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--will
you
read
it
verbatim,
please,
instead
of
just
trying
to
conjure
it
up?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hoffman.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-344,
thompson
versus
western
states
medical
center
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
