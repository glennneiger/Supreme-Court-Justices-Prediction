justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
does
manufacture
mean?
i
mean,
that's
a
problem
i
have
with
this
case,
they
manufacture
it.
the
manufacturer
does
exactly
the
same
thing
that
the
compounder
does,
puts
together
two
or
more
other
ingredients
into
a
new
drug.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
does
that...
why
does
advert...
you
see,
i
don't
mind...
don't
mind.
i
mean,
surely
congress
can
constitutionally
limit
it
to
try
to
prevent
evasion
of
the
normal
approval
process,
but
there
are
other
ways
of
limiting
it,
like
saying,
as
you
observed,
this
particular
druggist
operates
nation-wide
and
sells,
you
know,
thousands
and
thousands
of
dollars.
fine,
put
a
dollar
limit
on
the
amount
that
any
single
druggist
can
do.
wouldn't
that
achieve...
the
problem
is
that
the
government
has
sought
to
achieve
its
limitation
by
placing
a
limitation
on
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
it
have
to
do
that?
why
does
advertising
equate
with
manufacturing?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
wasn't
a
distinction
between
manufacturers.
i
mean,
the
problem
there
is,
if
you're
saying
it
is
good
for
this,
that
is
one
of
the
intended
uses,
and
you
have
to
have
gotten
approval
for
that
intended
use.
i
mean,
that's
what
did
the
trick
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
an
equation
of
advertising
with
manufacturing.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
can
produce
an
enormous
volume.
under
the
act,
it's
perfectly
okay
to
advertise,
you
know,
xyz
pharmacy.
we
compound
whatever
you
want,
best
prices
in
the
country,
guaranteed
lowest
prices
for
all
compounded
drugs.
that
advertising's
perfectly
okay,
so
long
as
you
don't
name
one
particular
compound
that
you're
offering,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
going
to
lead
to
certainly
very,
very
much
increased
volume.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
you
can't
do
it
that
way.
i
mean,
maybe
the
government
is
just
trying
to
ride
two
horses
at
the
same
time,
the
one
horse
being
that
all
drugs
must
be
approved
by
the
fda
and
the
other
one
being,
well,
we're
going
to
let,
you
know,
drugs
that
are
prescribed,
special
drugs
prescribed
by
doctors
are
okay,
and
we're
going
to
ride
both
of
these
horses
at
the
same
time
by
imposing
a
restriction
on
truthful
advertising.
i
mean,
just
maybe
you
can't
do
that.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
that
the
ultimate
problem
with
the
case
is
that
the
government
is
trying
to
have
it
both
ways--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
trying
to
say,
it's
not
enough
to
have
the
doctor
approve
this
drug.
we
don't
trust
doctors.
we
want
fda
approval.
but
then
on
the
other
hand
it's
saying,
well,
on
the
other
hand,
if
it's
a
doctor
and
an
individual
druggist,
it's
okay.
i
don't
understand
why
that
makes
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
they're
druggists.
unless
they're
druggists
who
don't
sell
too
much.
unless
they
do
it
with
druggists
who
truthfully
advertise.
why
does
that
make
any
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
the
text
there,
or
just
the
citation?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
advertising
man
doesn't
just
apply
that
advertising
to
the
general
public.
you
cannot
advertise
to
doctors,
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
advertising
ban
apply
only
to
advertising
to
the
general
public?
my
understanding
is,
it
applies
to
all
advertising.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
understanding
also
is
that
most
of
your
advertising
does
not
go
to
the
general
public,
but
goes
to
the
doctors
and
medical
professionals.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
is
not
a
matter
of
getting
john
q.
public
to
put
pressure
on
his
doctor.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
this
talks
about
manufacturing,
but
it
also...
what
it
says
is,
manufacturing
as
well
as
compounding
shall
include
repackaging
or
otherwise
changing
the
container
in
furtherance
of
the
distribution.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
we're
talking
about
here.
what's
the
other
section
you
wanted--
justice
antonin
scalia
--374(a)(2).
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
you
know,
i
found--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
can
i
turn
to
321(p),
which
is
the
other
section--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
cited
earlier,
and
you
said
that
that
section
makes
clear
that
compounding--
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
85a
of
the
government's
petition.
you
said
that
321(p)
makes
clear
that
compounding
is
not
manufacture
of
a
new
drug?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
more
than
it
just
defines
new
drug.
you
said
that
that
definition
makes
it
clear
that
compounding
isn't
included.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
that's
why
it's
no
problem
to
you
if
we
invalidate
the
whole
statute
and
you
go
back
to
the
status
quo
ante,
because
you
say
compounding
is
not
a
new
drug
anyway,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
the
context
in
which
it
came
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
is
it
in
that
definition
that
you
think
exempts
compounding?
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
does
it
say
capable
of
being
submitted?
i...
where
does
it
say
capable
of...
that's
not--
