justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
go
back
to
justice
kennedy,
because
i
would
like
to
extrapolate
a
little
bit
on
your
answer
to
him.
i
thought,
is
this
the...
what
the
congress
is
after
is,
it's
simply
a
matter
of
volume,
and
you
said
no,
so
i
said,
well,
what
is
it?
now,
in
my
own
mind
what
i
thought
is,
it's
the
direction
where
the
demand
comes
from.
there
might
be
children,
and
there
are,
who
find
it
very
difficult
to
swallow
pills
and
who
are
undergoing
chemotherapy,
and
therefore
there
must
be
a
way
of
adjusting
that
pill.
now,
with
some
medicines,
maybe
there's
one
child
out
of
a
million.
with
others,
maybe
there's
one
out
of
10.
both
cases
you
want
the
demands
for
the
special
drug
to
flow
from
the
doctor,
through
the
patient,
to
the
pharmacist,
and
what
you
don't
want
is
it
to
flow
from
the
pharmacist
to
the
patient
to
the
doctor
back
to
the
pharmacist.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
one
is
promotion
and
soliciting.
the
other
is
the
doctor
determining
there's
a
genuine
need
for
a
special
medicine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
do
we
know
that,
because
undoubtedly
i
think
what
justice
kennedy
said
must
be
right.
one
of
the
negative
effects
of
the
statute
is,
it
does
prevent
the
pharmacist
from,
through
advertising,
telling
the
doctor
that
we
have
this
special
way
of
making
drug
x.
that
is
a
negative
impact.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
counterbalancing
positive
impacts
in
preventing
the
general
solicitation
of
the
public,
which
will
produce
a
demand
you
don't
want.
now,
is
there
anything
that
tells
us
how
that
comparison
breaks
down?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.
hoffman,
what
you're
telling
us
is
something
any
doctor
would
know.
of
course
they
know
that
things
can
be
compounded
and
put
in
various
forms.
doesn't
your
advertising
get
down
to
something
pretty
specific?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
don't
you
key
it
to
a
particular
compound
for
a
particular
condition,
or
a
particular
kind
of
patient?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
isn't
that,
therefore,
where
your
argument
is
weakest?
you're
arguing
that
there...
that
compounding
cannot
be
manufacturing,
because
compounding
is
essentially
patient-specific.
it
is
idiosyncratic
in
the
sense
that
mr.
kneedler
used
the
term
and
yet,
for
your
advertising
to
be
of
any
value
and,
indeed,
as
you
have
just
described
the
advertising,
you're
getting
beyond
specific
patients.
you're
getting
into
classes
of
patients,
and
when
you
get
into
classes
of
patients,
this
neat
distinction
that
you
draw
dissolves.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
classes
of
drugs
and
classes
of
drug-takers.
it's
the
same
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
i'm
sure
that's
true--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
that's
a
different
point,
but
i
mean,
this
neat
distinction
between
the,
in
effect,
the
mass
manufacturer
and
purely
idiosyncratic
compounding
just
isn't
a
neat
distinction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
doesn't
it
specifically
just...
what
they
say,
i
gather,
it's
one
thing
for
a
doctor,
together
with
his
patient,
to
understand
the
patient's
allergy,
or
the
hesitancy
to
swallow
a
pill,
and
say
to
the
druggist,
will
you
adjust
this.
they
want
to
permit
that.
what
they
don't
want
to
permit
is
the
kind
of
advertising
which
is
a
form
of
soliciting,
which
leads
lots
of
patients,
as
i
might...
or
you
might.
suppose
they
found
something
good
for
baldness,
and
suppose
you
could
only
do
it
through
compounding,
and
i
read
that
in
the
newspaper,
i
go
to
my
doctor
and
i
say,
you
know,
the
druggist
over
here,
i
saw
it
on
the
internet,
is
there
anything...
he
says,
is
it
safe?
i
guess
so,
i
say,
that's
what
it
said
on
the
internet.
he
looks
it
up
there,
and
he
prescribes
that
in
reaction
to
what
i
want,
rather
than
his
thinking
of
it
because
of
my
special
need.
now,
once
that
happens,
they
say,
you
will
see
widespread
demand
for
certain
drugs
where
there
has
been
no
double-blind
study,
there
has
been
no
normal
testing,
there's
nothing
here
but
the
word
of
the
pharmacist,
and
that
is
not
sufficient
to
protect
the
public
health
and
safety.
now,
you
say
that
that
advertising
ban
serves
no
purpose,
they
say,
that's
the
purpose,
so
what's
wrong
with
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
a
dialogue,
but
what
they
haven't
had
is
the
double-blind
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
congress
in
this
act
says,
we
don't
want
dialogue.
we
want
double-blind
studies
before
we
let
something
go
out
into
the
marketplace,
that's
what
they
say,
and
that
isn't
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
it's
not
quite
reducing
volume.
it
might
be
that
there
are
10
million
children
who
have
a
hard
time
taking
pills.
it's
to
make
certain
that
the
demand
initiates
with
the
doctor
and
the
patient,
and
the
doctor
recognizes
the
need
of
the
patient,
rather
than
a
response
to
solicitation.
that's
the
purpose,
and
it's
not
quite
volume.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
makes
no
difference.
if
that's
true,
why
when
i
turn
on
the
television
set
do
i
see
advertisement
after
advertisement
asking
me
to
ask
my
doctor
for...
and
now,
you
fill
in
the
blank...
if
it
makes
no
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
harm
is
that
there
are
no
double-blind
studies
for
this
particular
test,
and
therefore,
while
we'll
make
an
exception
where
the
doctor
initiates
this
together
with
the
patient,
we
don't
want
breyer
and
his
friends
seeing
this
on
television
and
putting
pressure
on
their
doctors.
now,
that
may
sound
a
little
vague,
but
what
the
congress
says,
and
what
the
fda
says,
is
that's
necessary
to
protect
the
public
health,
and
what
they
say
is
not
without
plausibility.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
definition
that
says...
i
mean,
we
went
through
this
in
the
tobacco
case.
i
thought
that
a
new
drug
was
any
drug,
except
grass.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know.
that's
why
i'm
just
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
what
it
says
here,
so
if
there
is
some
exception
for
some
of
these
things--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
don't
see
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
they
want
the
exception.
of
course
you're
right
about
that.
they
want
the
exception,
but
the
issue
before
us
concerns
one
part
of
the
definition
of
the
exception,
and
so
i
don't
really
see
what
you're
talking
about
now
has
to
do
with
that.
i
mean
the
real
issue,
it
seemed
to
me,
was
what
we've
been
trying
to
get,
which
is
the
pros
and
cons
of
defining
this
exception
a
particular
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
the
doctor
find
out...
how
does
the
doctor
find
out
that...
he
knows
that
joe
smith
the
pharmacist
deals
with
compounding
generally.
he
thinks
that
this
patient
might
use
the
compounded
drug.
how
does
he
know
that
this
particular
drug
can
be
compounded?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
he
find
that
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
does
he
have
to
call
the
pharmacy--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--take
my
question.
my
question
is
not
whether
this
pharmacist
engages
in
compounding.
we
know
it.
how
does
the
doctor
know
that
the
pharmacist
can
compound
this
drug?
