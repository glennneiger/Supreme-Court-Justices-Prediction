justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
thought
just
as
justice
scalia
did,
that
you've
really
got
two
paradigms
in
it.
one
paradigm
is,
yes,
you
can't
on
a
broad
global
scale
depend
upon
the
prescriptions
of
doctors
to
guarantee
that
the
drugs
the
patients
are
going
to
get
are
safe.
that's
number
1.
number
2
seems
to
be
that
so
long
as
you
can
be
sure
that
the
doctor
is
focusing
on
what
you
earlier
called
sort
of
the
idiosyncracies
of
a
particular
patient,
so
long
as
we
know
the
doctor
is
really
paying
attention
to
detail,
we
can
tolerate
it
up
to
a
point,
and
the
problem
that
the
congress
i
thought
was
addressing
is,
how
do
we
draw
the
line
so
that
we
don't
get
a
situation
in
which
the
doctor
seems
to
be
addressing
idiosyncracies,
i.e.,
he
writes
a
prescription,
but
the
volume
gets
so
great
that
you
know
that
that
is
not
going
on,
and
the
act
seems
to
have
two
different
answers.
one
answer
is,
don't
advertise,
because
we
know
what
that
may
lead
to,
and
the
other
answer
is,
a
restriction
on
volume
that
pharmacies
can
write,
or
can
produce.
the
question,
i
guess,
that's
bothering
all
of
us
is,
why
do
you
need
the
advertising
in
addition
to
the
volume
restriction.
you
can
have
it
both
ways,
and
you
can
have
it
both
ways
by
enforcing
the
volume
restriction.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
have
a
narrower
volume
restriction.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
can't
a
narrow
volume
restriction
work?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
have
a
lower...
then
why
not
have
a
lower
aggregate?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that
begs
the
question,
because
you
know,
the
question
is,
under
central
hudson,
is
the
pharmacist
entitled
to
have
his
word,
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
why
can
the
object
not
be
accomplished
by
restrictions
in
volume
rather
than
restrictions
on
speech?
justice
david
h.
souter
where
is
that?
is
that
in
the
briefs?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it--
