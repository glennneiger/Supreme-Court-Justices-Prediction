what
you're
doing...
tell
me
if
i'm
incorrect.
you're
equating
the
size
of
the
market
with
whether
there's
manufacturing
or
compounding,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
advertising
is
not
necessarily
a
good
proxy
for
that.
suppose
you
had
a
pharmacy
that's
near
a
home
for
senior
citizens,
and
they
have
particular
success
with
one
doctor
in
compounding
a
particular
drug.
i
take
it
if
they
advertise
to
the
other
doctors
they
take
care
of
these
people,
now
we
can
compound
this
drug
for
you,
that
that's
a
violation
of
the
law.
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
proxy
for
being
a
manufacturer.
we
have
the
other
paradigm
of
this
huge,
nation-wide
chain
that
advertise
and
they
look
more
like
a
manufacturer.
i
just
don't
know
that
that's
an
adequate
proxy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
that's
based
on
the
size
of
the
market,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'll
look
at
your
brief
again,
but
i
thought
that
your
whole
theory
was
that
advertising
is
a
proxy
for
market,
which
is
a
proxy
for
manufacturing,
versus
the
compounding.
i
thought
that
was
the
heart
of
your
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
is
why
advertising
is
such
an
imprecise
proxy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
have
prohibited,
or
the
government
prohibits
the
pharmacy
from
advertising
to
the
doctor
the
availability
of
this
remedy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
suppose,
in
justice
breyer's
example,
that
doctors
didn't
know
that
this
could
be
done
with
this
pill,
and...
but
under
the
statute
you're
defending,
the
pharmacy
could
not
advertise
to
doctors
that
it
can
prepare
this
drug
in
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
just
say,
my
concern
here
is
that
you're
telling
us
what
the
general
practice
of
your
particular
client
is.
i
thought
what
we
were
hearing
was
the
legal
question
whether
or
not
the
government
may
forbid
you
from
advertising
that
you
compound
a
specific
drug,
and
it
may
be
that
that's
not
what
you
usually
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
the
question
that
we
have
before
us,
and
if
we
affirm
the
judgment
in
your
favor,
you
are
going
to
be
allowed
to
do
advertising
in
a
lot
more
specific
ways
than
you
now
describe,
and
that's
the
legal
issue
we
have
to
decide.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
compounding,
yes.
