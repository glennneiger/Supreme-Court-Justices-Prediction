one
question
about
your
rule
about
priorities,
the,
and
it's
the
basic
rule.

one
is
a
one
is
a
baseball
game,
another
is
a
concert,
another
is
is
a
lecture
on
on
dinosaurs,
and
another
is
political
speech.

it,
if
you....
justice

but
just
supposing
all
you
know
about
it
is,
they
want
to
make
s-
it's
a
political
rally
of
some
kind
on
the
one
hand,
baseball,
music,
all
those
can
the
content,
without
any
hostility
to
the
particular
message,
be
one
of
the
criteria
that
can
can
break
ties?

the
earlier
application
to
be
accepted,
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
required
to
be
accepted?
w-
which
one
of
those
says
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
say
the
converse,
that
it
must
be
accepted
if
it's
earlier.
justice
john
paul

i
don't
see
i
really
don't
see
it,
and
i'm
not
sure
it's
commanded,
either,
but...
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
that's
constitutionally
required
that
it
be
a
first
come,
first
serve
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
those
provisions
in
means
it's
a
little
different
from
the
ordinary
zoning
ordinance
or
business
license,
because
those
are
all
motivated
by
c-
first
amendment
concerns,
i
assume.
