mr.
richard
l.
wilson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
the
unanimous
opinion
in
freedman
versus
maryland
this
court
stated
that
when
the
government
imposes
a
permit
requirement
on
the
exercise
of
free
speech,
that
permit
scheme
must
include
certain
procedural
safeguards
which
are
there,
quite
obviously,
to
prevent
the
unwarranted
and
perhaps
unlawful
delay
or
suppression
of
speech
that
might
occur
without
them.
[inaudible]
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
while
i
agree
that
there's
a
difference
between
the
two
cases,
this
case
begs
for
more
protection
than
the
speech
involved
in
freedman.
because
after
all,
the
freedman
case
was
specifically
specifically
arose
from
a
censorship
scheme
which
was
aimed
at
sexually
explicit
speech.
this
is
a
case
involving
core
political
speech.
and
although...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
the...
well...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
i
i
believe
that
the
regulation
in
this
case
is
content...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
it
is
rife
with
the
opportunity
to
make
viewpoint
based
decisions,
but
not
on
its
face.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
justice
kennedy,
with
respect,
i
could
not
disagree
with
you
more,
and
i
think
we
can
look
at
a
few
cases
to
show
that
this
is
surely
a
prior
restraint
case,
and
the
one
that
comes
to
mind
most
readily
is
where
that
exact
same
question
was
presented
to
this
court
when,
in
fw
pbs
versus
the
city
of
dallas,
the
fifth
circuit
had
held
that
the
dallas
licensing
scheme,
which
was
content-neutral,
period,
in
all
regards,
which
a
content-neutral
licensing
scheme
licensing
sexually
oriented
business
in
dallas,
was
a
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction,
and
this
court
rejected
that
approach
and
said,
first
we
find
that
it
is
an
unlawful
prior
restraint,
and
therefore...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
justice
o'connor,
there's
no
indication
in
this
record
or
in
any...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
certainly,
justice
o'connor,
that's
possible.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
justice
ginsburg,
the
record
in
this
instance
is
a
solid,
concrete
case.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
mr.
mcdonald
never
received
a
permit.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
to
conduct
a
spontaneous
rally
on
a
very
limited
basis.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
one
of
the
events
in
the
lodging
material?
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
i
think
clearly
it's
a
prior
restraint.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
mr.
chief
justice,
from
neer
versus
minnesota
forward,
the
court
has
said
that
when
speech
is
prohibited
in
advance,
that
is
a...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
my
problem
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
not
that
you
have
to
get
in
line
with
other
people
and
and
share
the
use
of
the
park,
which
was
justice
o'connor's
concern
when
she
posed
the
time,
place,
and
manner
re-
question.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
it
is
one
of
our...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
but
that's
not
what
it
says,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
i
think
poulos
w-
would
have
been
decided
differently
by
this
court...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
had
had
the
had
the
had
your
had
your
court,
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire,
not
construed
that
statute
in
such
a
limiting
way
to
say
that
if
you
apply
for
a
permit
under
poulos
and
under
cox
you
get
the
permit,
there
was
no
discretion
to
deny,
and
in
the
opinion
that
this
court
wrote
in
poulos,
it
pointed
that
out,
that
that
cured
the
problem
in
that
case,
and
i
think
realistically
this
court
has
recognized...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
my
understanding
of
that
case
is
that
after
the
construction
of
the
hamp-
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
placed
on
it,
that
became
part
and
parcel
of
the
statute,
and
even
though
the
statute
retained
the
discretion,
it
had
authoritively[:authoritatively]
been
limited
by
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court,
so
the
discretion
was
gone
by
judicial
act
and
not
by
legislative
change.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
by
the
way,
justice
scalia,
there's
another
aspect
of
your
inquiry,
a-
and
we
both
agree,
obviously,
that
if
you
meet
the
qualifications,
you're
entitled
to
the
permit.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
first,
in
direct
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
inquiry,
a
scheme
that
says
you
may
not
obtain
a
permit
for
an
event
at
a
day
and
time
for
which
another
permit
has
already
been
issued,
no
question.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
surely
you
can
have
a
permit
scheme.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
i-
i-
the
question
may
well
be,
when
can
you
lawfully
deny
a
permit
for
free
speech
under
this
under
a
permit
scheme
in
what
is
the
traditional
public
forum,
a
public
park,
and
what
is
the
most
precious
of
speech,
core
political
speech.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
a
first
come,
first
serve
rule
would
certainly
help
the
situation
and,
of
course,
these
permit
applications
are
dated,
time-dated
and
time-stamped
when
they
are
submitted,
but
there
is
no
requirement
that
it
be
first
come,
first
serve.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
well,
obviously
it's
a
very
difficult
question
on
facts
which
might
never,
ever
occur,
and
i'm
not
claiming
that
when
the
park
district
is
making
a
decision
on
whether
to
issue
a
permit,
for
space
a
on
day
a,
it
has
to
look
at
these
permits
and
say,
oops,
political
speech,
first
in
line,
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
well,
i
would
certainly
think
that
this
case
need
not
turn
on
on
that
somewhat...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
i
believe
that's
wrong
because
well,
first
of
all,
a-
again,
we're
not
going
to
find
that
situation,
but
let's
assume
we
did,
and
they
bump
their
heads
on
the
way
in.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
when
first
come,
first
serve
does
not
work?
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
it
would
seem
that
as
long
as
the
event
is
suitable
for
that
particular
park,
first
come,
first
serve
should
always
work.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
well
ju-
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
i
do.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
justice
scalia...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
one
one
would
assume
that...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
the
holder
of
the
permit
would
be
reasonable
in
accommodating...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
i've
met
them.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
no,
sir,
and
that's
why
i
believe
that
a
first
come,
first
serve
rule
is
going
to
be
reasonable
in
almost
all...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
well,
of
course,
freedman
ha-,
i
mean,
that
they
analysis
from
freedman
has
been
used
in
non
censorship
cases,
but
in
that
case
the
government
needs
to
bear
that
burden.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
no
question,
of
course,
the
supremacy
clause
makes
freedman
applicable
to
that
state
court,
but
the
likelihood
that
an
individual
is
going
to
insist
on
going
forward
with
judicial
review
when
his
permit
was
denied
because
another
permit
had
already
been
issued
is
slight.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
the
problem
with
that,
we
have
brought
a
facial
challenge
in
this
case
because
of
the
difficulty,
every
single
time
one
is
refused
a
permit,
in
going
to
state
court
or
federal
court
and
litigating
whether
that
particular
denial
was
appropriate,
and
the
medicine
here
is
to
get
rid
of
the
bad
ordinance
which
allows
inappropriate
and
content-based,
or
viewpoint-based
decisions
behind
closed
doors,
even
if
they
are
not
authorized
on
the
face
of
the
scheme.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
well,
some
have
to
now.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
suggest,
justice
ginsburg,
that
a
permit
to
hold
a
core
political
speech
rally
in
a
public
park
deserves
at
least
as
much
protection
as
the
permit
to
operate
an
adult...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
but
this
court
has
said
that
in
cases
of
public
parks,
the
power
of
the
government
to
restrict
free
speech
activity
is
as,
at
its
most
circumscribed.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
we
said
that
in
hague
versus
you
said
that
in
hague...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
but
no
one
has
ever
suggested,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
is
not
the
law
today,
and
indeed,
that
one
quotation
from
hague
appears
in
core
political
speeches
through
this
day,
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
oft-repeated...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
no,
it
is
not,
s-
justice
souter.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
justice
breyer,
i-
in
order
to
do
that
it
would
seem
that
this
court
would
have
to
retreat
from
what
it
said
in
forsyth,
in
which
it
stated
that
when
a
prior
restraint
in
the
form
of
a
permit
to
conduct
a
political
event
in
a
public
forum
is
involved,
a
facial
challenge
is
appropriate,
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
my
answer
is
that
this
is
a
particular
situation
where
facial
challenges
are
appropriate.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
content
of
the
speech.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
if
there
are
competing
applications
and
one
of
them
is
a
free
speech
event
and
one
of
them
is
a
softball
game,
and
the
decision
is
made
based
on
what
the
free
speech
event
is
urging,
what
the
message
is,
that
is
entirely
inappropriate.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
if
your
question
assumes
that
each
of
those
events
would
be
appropriate
for
that
specific...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
then
no.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
justice
o'connor,
i'd
like
to
address
quickly
two
points
that
you
raised.
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
justice
ginsburg,
that
would
be
the
choice
of
the
park
district
of
the
city
of
chicago,
because
the
park
district
is
the
is
the
party
that
has
to
go
to
court
to
seek...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
but
there's
certainly
a
distinction
between
those
businesses
that
justice
o'connor
was
writing
about
in
fw
pbs
and
a...
mr.
richard
l.
wilson
i
would
then
say,
justice
ginsburg,
that
this
court
has
elevated
the
kind
of
sexually
explicit
speech
in
that
case
above
the
core
political
speech
in
this
case,
based
on
the
content
of
the
speech,
which
would
fly
in
the...
