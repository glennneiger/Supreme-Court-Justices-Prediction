the
standards
there
was
a
list
of
thirteen,
and
they
seem
to
be
reasonable,
fairly
cle-
clear
standards,
and
you
are
coming
to
us
with
a
facial
challenge,
and
are
we
to
project
that
those
standards
will
not
work
properly?
you're
not
coming
to
us
with
any
concrete
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
he
was
granted
it,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
conduct
his
expression.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
list
that
we
have
are
functions
that
were
being
held
at
the
park.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
didn't
happen,
and
you
you
say
you
give
us
this
one
instance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where?
you
say,
the
government
goes
to
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
asked
you
before,
what
is
the
scheme
that
you
said
would
be
constitutional,
and
one
part
of
it
surprised
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
does
it
that
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
business,
a
permit
to
operate
a
business,
not
to
hold
an
event
in
a
public
park.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
strauss,
you've
ably
distinguished
freedman,
but
do
you
think
that
none
of
the
procedural
safeguards
that
were
involved
in
freedman
are
applicable
here,
from
here
starting
with
the
basic,
the
the
administrator
has
to
have
some
time
limit
to
act
on
these
petitions
to
hold
events?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
did
say
that
you
you
feel
some
impulsion
from
the
first
amendment
to
have
a,
have
to
make
a
decision
within
a
set
time
to
guard
against
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
adequacy
of
judicial
review?
i
take
it
one
objection
was
that
you
don't
get
any
actual
hearing
in
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
federal
regulations
for
the
use
of
federal
parks,
the
use
of
the
mall,
do
they
differ
with
respect
to
the
may
deny?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
may
deny,
implying
that
there
are
cases
where,
although
you
could,
you
don't
have
to
deny?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
mean
if
you
pick
the
fede-
federal
court,
that
illinois
is
going
to
write
a
statute
that
says,
and
if
you
choose
to
come
to
the
federal
court
rather
than
the
state
court,
the
federal
court
is
going
to
have
x
number
of
days
to
decide
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
but
that's
not
what
justice
o'connor
said
in
in
her
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
notion
that
the
scheme
is
invalid
unless
the
park
goes
to
court,
and
the
court
has
a
tight
time
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
follow
that
at
all.
