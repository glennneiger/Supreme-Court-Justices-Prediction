justice
david
h.
souter
that
same
thing
was
true,
wasn't
it,
in
poulos?
i
mean,
the
language
in
poulos
was
even
more
protean
than
the
language
in
in
in
in
the
may
phrase.
justice
david
h.
souter
got
to
overrule
it
to...
justice
david
h.
souter
your
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't
the
discretion
left
the
same
discretion,
in
effect,
to
evaluate
facts,
and
to
act
based
upon
that
evaluation
which
the
chicago
scheme
allowed
chicago?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it
doesn't
say
that,
doesn't
it
retain
exactly
the
discretion
that
you're
complaining
about?
justice
david
h.
souter
we've
got
the
collision
at
the
door.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'd
like
to
know
what
the
principle
is
that
you
want
us
to
apply,
and
i
think
the
principle
that
you
want
to
us
to
apply
means
that
when
they,
that
when
they
bump
each
other's
foreheads
at
the
door,
political
speech
has
got
to
win,
or
there's
an
unconstitutional
discretion
left,
amounting
to
the
possibility
of
a
prior
restraint.
justice
david
h.
souter
changing
the
hypothetical.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
the
hypo.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
isn't
your
argument
for
applying
it
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
you
explain
the
the
degree
of
discretion
to
grant,
in
the
event
that
the
conditions
are
not
satisfied?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
there
have
been
discretion
in
this
case?
regar-
let's
assume
the
only
prior
violation
had
been
the
the
the
fact
that
if
that
earlier
gathering
people
were
still
hanging
around
at
eleven
o'clock,
after
the
park
or
after
eleven
when
the
park
closed.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
that's
the
second
distinction
from
freedman.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
same
problem
get
injected
by
the
exception
clause
in
the
ordinance,
that
in
fact
they
can
waive
conditions
if
there
would
be
a
first
amendment
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
third
distinction
that
you
want
to
rely
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
from
that,
i
assume
there's
no
way
to
write
a
regulation
that
is
not
going
to
require
some
some
judgment,
some
discretion.
