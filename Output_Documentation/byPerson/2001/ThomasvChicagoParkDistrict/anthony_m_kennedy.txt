anthony
m.
kennedy
well
i
i
i
i
h-
h-
h-
have
to
say
that
i,
in
thinking
about
the
case,
i
suppose
analytically
this
is
a
prior
restraint.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
point
remains
that
i
i
i
just
think
you
overstate
the
case
when
you
tell
us
this
is
a
freedman
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
w-
well
but
of
course
that
s-
that
assumes
that
you're
going
to
have
a
permit
scheme.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
that
that
assumes
that
you
can
have
a
permit
scheme.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
what
what
what
the
requisites
are
for
the
permit
scheme.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
your
brief,
you
say
that
even
under
the
first
come,
first
serve
rule
the
government
has
the
obligation
to
go
to
court
to
validate
the
permit,
under
freedman,
and
i
i
just
don't
get
that
out
of
our
c-,
that's
a
sure,
that's
what
freedman
said,
but
freedman
was
a
very
special
case,
and
a
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation
for
a
park
is
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
one
of
the
objections
made
by
the
petitioner
was
that
either
in
this
case
or,
reading
the
regulations,
you
don't
have
to
give
written
reasons.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
based
on
on
previous
damage
and
material
misrepresentations
in
the
earlier...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
regulations
require
that
you
give
the
reasons?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
i
think
there's
considerable
merit,
what
you
have
just
said,
although
at
the
end
of
your
brief
you
you
make
the
final
argument
that
this
is
really
not
a
speech
statute
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
argument
is
to
say
we've
never
done
this
with
reference
to
parks.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
along
the
lines
of
justice
scalia's
question,
would
it
be
proper
for
a
city
council
or
municipality
to
draft
an
ordinance
just
like
this
one
and
then,
then
at
the
end
saying,
the
commissioner
of
parks,
in
his
sole
discretion,
may
waive
any
or
all
of
the
foregoing
requirements?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we've
said
in
in
a
case
like
forsyth
that
the
s-
discretion
has
to
has
to
have
s-
h-
have
some
definition
and
some
control
to
it,
and
if
you
have
at
the
end
an
an
absolute
waiver
provision,
s-
it
seems
to
me
that
would
contradict
that.
