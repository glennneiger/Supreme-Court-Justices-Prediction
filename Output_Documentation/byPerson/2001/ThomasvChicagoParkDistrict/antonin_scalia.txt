justice

scalia
you
you
you
agree
that
if
the

are

your,
if
your

meets
all
the

he
gets
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
client
doesn't
meet
some
of
the

he
may

whereas
somebody
that
the
park

likes
more
will
be
allowed
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
discretion
was
gone
to
deny
somebody
who
met
the
conditions?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there,
was
there
no
discretion
to
grant
someone
who
did
not
meet
the
conditions?
did
the

speak
to
that?

you

so
that

gee,
you

the

y-

no,
no,

this

it's
the

and
the

are
only
going

be
there
for

justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
it
works
out

way
because
of

justice

can
you

justice

it

you

well,
they

justice

how

if

how
can
you
possibly
say

the

is
to

this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
respondent,
the
chicago
park
district
is
responsible
for
operating
public
parks
in
chicago.
it
adapted
an
ordinance
that
requires
individuals
to
obtain
a
permit
before
conducting
large
scale
events.
that
is
event
attended
by
more
than
50
persons.
the
ordinance
specifies
the
13
grounds
on
which
a
permit
may
be
denied,
which
includes
such
matters
as
failure
to
tender
the
required
user
fee,
insurance
certificate,
or
security
deposit,
misrepresentation
in
the
application,
previous
damage
to
park
property
by
the
applicant
that
was
not
paid
for,
the
proposed
use
is
unreasonable
danger
to
health
and
safety
of
the
public,
and
perhaps
most
important
of
all
conflict
with
previously
approved
used
by
another
applicant.
petitioners
have
applied
to
the
park
district
on
several
occasions
for
permits
to
hold
rallies
advocating
the
legalization
of
marijuana.
the
park
district
granted
some
of
these
permits
but
denied
others
and
petitioners
filed
an
action
challenging
the
park
district’s
permit
scheme
as
unconstitutional
on
its
phase.
the
district
court
granted
the
park
district
summary
judgment
and
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
affirmed
the
seventh
circuit.
the
first
amendment’s
guarantee
of
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press
prohibits
a
wide
assortment
of
government
restraints
upon
expression,
but
the
core
abuse,
against
which
it
was
directed,
was
the
scheme
of
licensing
laws
implemented
to
contain
the
so-called
evils
of
the
printing
press
in
the
16th
and
17th
century,
england.
the
english
licensing
system
punish
the
publication
of
any
work
without
a
license
and
require
that
all
works
to
be
submitted
to
a
government
official
for
approval.
this
government’s
licensor
wielded
broad
authority
to
suppress
works
that
he
found
to
be
“heretical,
seditious,
schismatical,
or
offensive”.
in
the
case
called
freedman
versus
maryland
decided
in
1965,
we
confronted
a
maryland
state
law
that
enacted
a
strikingly
similar
system
of
prior
restraint
for
motion
pictures.
it
required
that
every
film
be
submitted
to
a
board
of
censors
before
the
film
was
shown
anywhere
in
the
states.
the
board
enjoyed
authority
to
reject
films
that
it
considered
obscene
or
that
“tended
in
the
judgment
of
the
board
to
debase
or
corrupt
morals
or
incite
to
crimes.”
characteristics
defined
by
the
statute
in
very
broad
terms.
we
recognize
in
freedman,
that
a
scheme
conditioning
expression
on
a
licensing
body’s
prior
approval
of
content
presents
peculiar
dangers
to
constitutionally
protected
speech.
in
response
to
these
grave
dangers,
we
held
that
a
film
licensing
processes
must
contain
certain
procedural
safeguards
in
order
to
avoid
constituting
an
unconstitutional
prior
restraint.
one,
any
restraint
prior
to
judicial
review
can
be
imposed
only
for
a
specified
brief
period;
two,
expeditious
judicial
review
of
that
decision
must
be
availed;
and
three,
the
censor
must
bear
the
burden
of
going
to
court
to
suppress
the
speech
and
must
be
bear
the
burden
the
proof
once
in
court.
petitioners
contend
that
the
park
district,
like
the
board
of
censors
in
freedman,
must
initiate
litigation
every
time
it
denies
a
permit
and
that
the
ordinance
must
specify
a
deadline
for
judicial
review
to
challenge
a
permit
denial.
we
reject
those
contentions.
freedman
is
an
opposite
because
the
ordinance
at
issue
here
is
not
subject
matter
censorship
but
content
neutral
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation
of
the
use
of
a
public
forum.
regulation
of
the
use
of
a
public
forum
that
insures
the
safety
and
convenience
of
the
people
simply
does
not
raise
the
censorship
concerns
that
prompted
us
to
impose
the
extraordinary
procedural
safeguards
on
the
film
licensing
process
in
freedman.
the
park
district’s
ordinance
does
not
authorize
a
licensor
to
pass
judgment
on
the
content
of
speech.
none
of
the
13
grounds
for
denying
a
permit
has
anything
to
do
with
what
a
speaker
might
say
indeed,
the
ordinance
is
not
even
directed
to
communicative
activity
as
such
but
rather
to
all
activity
conducted
in
a
public
park
the
picnicker
and
soccer
player
no
less
than
the
political
activists
or
parade
marshal
must
apply
for
a
permit
if
the
50
person
limit
is
exceeded,
and
the
object
of
the
permit
system
is
not
to
exclude
communication
of
a
particular
content
but
rather
to
coordinate
multiple
uses
of
limited
space
to
assure
preservation
of
the
park
facilities,
to
prevent
uses
that
are
dangerous,
unlawful,
or
impermissible
under
the
park’s
rules,
and
to
assure
financial
accountability
for
damage
cause
by
the
event.
of
course,
where
the
licensing
official
enjoys
unduly
broad
discretion
in
determining
whether
to
grant
or
deny
a
permit,
there
is
a
risk
that
he
will
favor
or
disfavor
speech
based
on
its
content.
we
have
thus
required
that
even
a
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation
contain
adequate
standards
to
guide
the
official’s
decision
and
render
its
subject
to
effective
judicial
review.
the
park
district’s
ordinance
however
clearly
meets
this
test
it
provides
that
the
district
must
decide
whether
to
grant
or
deny
the
permit
within
28
days
of
receiving
an
application,
that
the
district
may
deny
a
permit
only
on
one
of
the
13
specified
grounds,
and
that
it
must
clearly
set
forth
in
writing
the
reasons
for
denial.
these
standards
are
reasonably
specific
and
objective,
and
they
are
enforceable
on
review,
first,
by
appeal
to
the
general
superintendent
of
the
park
district
and
then
by
writ
of
common
law
certiorari
to
the
illinois
courts.
petitioner
contends
that
the
ordinance
confers
an
unacceptable
degree
of
discretion
because
it
merely
describes
the
grounds
on
which
the
park
district
may
deny
a
permit
and
not
the
grounds
on
which
it
must
do
so.
this
petitioner
contends
allows
the
park
district
to
ignore
the
prohibitions
for
some
favored
speakers
and
to
enforce
them
against
others.
we
think
not
the
park
district
has
reasonably
interpreted
its
authority
to
permit
waiver
of
only
such
effects
as
are
merely
technical
or
of
such
a
nature
as
not
to
impair
the
purpose
of
the
restrictions
in
question.
denying
waivers
to
disfavored
speakers
on
the
basis
of
what
they
have
to
say
would
of
course
be
unconstitutional,
but
this
abuse
must
be
dealt
with
if
and
when
a
pattern
of
unlawful
favoritism
appears
rather
than
by
insisting
upon
a
rigid
mindless
no
waiver
application
of
the
permit
requirements
which
would
likely
suppress
more
harmless
speech
than
petitioner’s
proposed
no
waiver
rule
would
protect.
the
court’s
decision
is
unanimous
