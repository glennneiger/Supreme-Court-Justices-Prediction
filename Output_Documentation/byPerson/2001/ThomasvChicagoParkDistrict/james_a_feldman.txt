mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
i
think
more
the
latter.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
kind
of
thing
that
mr.
strauss
described,
is
that
if
there
is
a
minor
if
if
you
put
in
your
permit
application
slightly
too
late,
or
there
was
a
stray
mark
on
your
application,
requiring
total
strictness
on
any
of
these
criteria
would
just
mean
that
people
who
really
should
be
entitled
to
have
the
opportunity
to
speak...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
i
think...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
as
i
think
as
mr.
strauss
i
think
it
was
mr.
strauss
said,
the
the
the
the
that
is
whatever
the
flexibility
or
discretion
that
remains
in
a
system
like
this
would
be
exe-
has
to
be
exercised
in
accordance
with
those
grounds
for
denial.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
but
i
i
think
well,
you
could,
it
could
well
be
that
the
purpose
is
to
make
sure
that
the
park
district
can
guarantee
it
can
consider
it,
but
if
they
if
it
comes
in
on
a
day,
one
day
late
but
there's
nothing
else
on
top
of
it
that
they're
waiting
to
consider,
if
it's
in
the
wintertime
when
they
have
very
few
permit
applications,
they
can
get
to
it
anyhow,
and
there's
no
reason
for
them
not
to
permit
that
use
of
the
park.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
i
think
that's
right,
and
i
think
a
crucial
feature
of
this
requirement
is
that,
if,
of
the
ordinance
here
is
that
the
parks
are
used
for
multiple
uses
by
multiple
people.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that
should
be
addressed
on
a
on
a
on
an
as
applied
basis,
and
and
i
think
it
could
be
in
the
state
court
proceedings,
or
in
a
nineteen
eighty-three
proceeding.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
the
the
only
difficul-
it
would
depend
on
what
that
meant.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
oh,
i
i
think
well,
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
that
would
at
least
be
the
most
reasonable
construction
of
an
ordinance
like
this,
where
there's
a-
a-
attempt
to
detail
these
thirteen
specific
criteria
quite
specifically,
and
there's
no
suggestion
that
there's
any
other
basis
on
which
the
park
district
can
act,
and
it
it,
i
i
think
that
that's
just
the
most
reasonable
interpretation
of
this
kind
of
ordinance.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
way
those
are,
have
consistently
been
applied
is,
those
are
the
grounds
that
are
suppose,
to
be
considered
i-
in
determining
whether
you
can
grant
a
permit,
and
there
aren't
other
grounds
on
which
a
permit
would
be
denied.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
basically,
yes.
