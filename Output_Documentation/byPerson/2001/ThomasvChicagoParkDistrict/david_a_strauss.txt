mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
first
come,
first
serve
if
the
application
is
is
valid,
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
it-
i-
the
a
valid
applica-,
a
fully
executed
prior
application
for
a
permit
has
been
received,
and
a...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
a
reason
for
denial,
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
a
the
,
the
only
ground
for
denial
there
are
other
ground-
possible
grounds
for
denial,
but
one
ground
for
denial
is
someone
was
there
first.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
it
is
our
system,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
my
understanding,
justice
scalia,
is
that
we
have
a
practice,
although
i
don't
know
if
it's
in,
if
it's
written
down
anywhere,
of
not
accepting
applications
for
more
than
some
period
of
time
in
advance,
mr.
david
a.
strauss
oh,
justice
o'connor,
we
we
we
do
have
to
grant
it
if
it
meets
those
requirements.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
may
deny
is
an
authorization
to
the
park
district
to
deny
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
way
the
competing
applications
are
handled
is
on
a
first
come,
first
serve
basis.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
kennedy,
we
do
provide
reasons.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
we
did,
in
this
case.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
they
do.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
then
goes
on
to
say
that
where
feasible,
thif-
if
there
is
a
com-
if
there
is
a
competing
use
the
park
district
will
propose
a
way
to
accommodate
the
accomodate
the
use.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
a
late
application,
application
that's
not
submitted.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
there
would
have
been,
if
we
had
concluded
that
if
if
if
the
applicant
said
to
us
something
that
gave
us
reason
to
believe
it
wouldn't
happen
again,
or
if
the
nature
of
the
event
were
such
that
if
was
scheduled
earlier
in
the
day,
or
something
like
that,
that
it
wouldn't
happen
again,
or
if
it
happened
again
it
wouldn't
be
so
much
of
a
problem,
but
we
don't
assert,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
assert,
consistent
with
the
ordinance,
a
kind
of
free
floating
discretion
to
overlook
violations
for
people
we
like
and
not
for
people
we
don't
like.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
o'connor,
on
the
grants,
the
record,
the
the
most
precise
number
we
have
in
the
record
is
there
are
thousands
of
applications
and
thousands
of
grants
a
year.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
denials,
justice
o'connor,
is
a
hard
number
to
come
up
with,
and
this
bears
on
the
freedman
versus
maryland
point,
because
what
often
happens
is
that
the
denial
takes
the
form
of
saying,
well
we
can't
accommodate
you
at
this
space
at
this
time,
but
if
you're
willing
to
move
your
event
a
week
later,
or
willing
to
move
it
to
this
alternative
site,
then
we
can
accommodate
you.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
o'connor,
it
was
denied
for
multiple
reasons.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
there
is,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
second
distinction
freedman
while
that
that
is
a
distinction,
justice
souter,
but
the
second
distinction
really
is
that
a
a
a
key
premise
of
freedman
is
that
the
decision
in
question
was
one
that
the
courts
had
superior
competence
to
make,
and
that
the
agency
was
to
be
distrusted
in
making.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
souter,
that
that
clause,
t-
two
two
things
about
that
clause
are
are
salient,
i
think.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
which
happened
here.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
third
distinction,
justice
souter,
is
that
in
the
freedman
context
the
court
had
indicated
a
strong
preference
for
after
the
fact
regulation,
that
if
the
co-
if
a
community
is
concerned
about
obscenity,
the
way
to
regulate
that
is
by
after
the
fact
criminal
prohibitions.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
put
that
part
of
freedman
in
a
different
category.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
or
a
zoning
permit,
variance
of
some
kind,
which,
of
course,
apply
to
expressive
activities,
but
to
a
lot
of
other
activities,
too.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that's
right,
justice
kennedy,
but
as
some
of
the
questions
from
the
court
suggested
during
my
colleague's
argument,
because
these
are
parks,
perhaps
the
government
has
more
leeway
than
it
would
have
in
telling
people
what
they
can
do
on
their
own
property.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
well,
for
anyone
claiming
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
right,
there
should
be
an
avenue
for
prompt
judicial
review,
and
i
,
further,
i
think
that
part
of
freedman
is
intended
to
deal
the
situation
like
that
present
in
some
of
this
court's
cases,
in
fw
pbs
and
in
shuttlesworth
in
particular,
a
situation
where
the
applicant
can't
be
quite
sure
when
the
permit's
been
denied,
so
so
so
the
applicant
doesn't
quite
know
when
it's
okay
to
go
to
court.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
justice
stevens,
i
don't
i
don't
i
wouldn't
i
wouldn't
want
to
duck
the
issue.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
if
the
court
does
not
accept
our
argument
that
this
is
more
like
a
business
license,
mr.
david
a.
strauss
then
yes,
prompt
action
or
a
specified
time
for
action
by...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
and
an
opportunity
for
prompt
judicial
review,
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
ginsburg,
my
reading
of
the
illinois
cases
is
that
that's
not
true
even
in
state
court
and,
of
course,
the
pet-
the
applicant
has
the
option
of
going
to
the
federal
court.
