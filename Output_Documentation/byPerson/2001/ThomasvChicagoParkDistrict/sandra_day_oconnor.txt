content

justice
sandra

o'connor
in
your
view,
the
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
your
premise
may
be
one
that
w-
we're
going
to
have
trouble
adopting.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
answer
whether
that
is
possible,
under
first
amendment
time,
place,
and
manner
doctrine.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
language
of,
may
grant,
is
something
that
allows
too
much
discretion?
is
that
your
complaint?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
read
may
as
shall
grant,
if
these
conditions
are
met?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
maybe
it
mean
means
that
the
permit
must
be
granted
if
the
categories
are
met.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
whole
scheme
is
written
on
the
basis
that
the
permit
may
be
denied,
and
there
are
a
set
of
criteria,
but
it
doesn't
appear
to
be
any
affirmative
requirement
that
anything
be
granted
if
it
meets
all
the
requirements.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
deny.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
and
it
doesn't
do
anything
to
govern
how
you
grant
competing
applications,
other
than
the
fact
that
you
say
there
is
some
kind
of
built
in
first
come,
first
serve
basis.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
record
tell
us
how
many
permits
are
granted
and
how
many
denied
each
year...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
permit
was
denied
to
mr.
mcdonald
based
on
some
prior
event
where
people
stayed
after
eleven
o'clock.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
administrative
mechanisms
in
place
for
someone
who
wants
to
challenge
the
basis
for
the
denial...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
administratively?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
if
s-
if
something
like
this
is
to
be
considered
valid,
what
are
the
limits
to
make
it
reasonable
as
a
regulation?
we've
already
mentioned
prompt
action
should
be
required,
perhaps,
by
the
park.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
do
you
think
we
should
view
it
as
mr.
strauss
urges,
as
a
zoning
ordinance,
or
a
business
license,
or
as
some
kind
of
content-neutral
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction?
