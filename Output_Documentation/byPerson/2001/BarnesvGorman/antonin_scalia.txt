justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
the
eighth
circuit
allow
you
to
argue
in
the
alternative?
i
mean,
you
couldn't
have
said
we
have
eleventh
amendment
immunity
and...
and
if
we
don't,
we're
a
municipality,
and
therefore
newport
applies.
you
could
have
done
that,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
would...
the...
the
broader
position
would
be...
would
be
taking
the
case
on
the
same
basis
that
the
eighth
circuit
decided
it.
right?
on
the
broader
ground.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there...
this
is
not
a
constitutional
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
the
doctrine
of...
of
observing
the
narrowest
possible
constitutional
ground
does
not
apply
here.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
this
would
be
an
opportunity
to...
to
do
what
the
court
is
supposed
to
do,
and
that
is
clean
up
confusion
below
on
the
meaning
of
a
statute,
and
the
broader
confusion
is
certainly
much...
much
more
worth
clearing
up
than
the
narrower
confusion.
justice
antonin
scalia
explicitory?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
say
explicitory?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
like
it
though.
it's
good.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
wouldn't
achieve
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
achieve
that.
would
it,
mr.
robbins?
i
mean,
you...
you
would
not
tell
the
jury,
you
know...
you're
telling
the
jury,
punish
this
person
if
you
think
he
deserves
punishment.
you're
not
telling
the
jury,
by
the
way,
humiliation
damages
are
not
available,
and
therefore
give
this
fellow
as...
as
much
humiliation
damages,
calling
them
punitive
damages,
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say...
you
say
she
wasn't
a
party
to
the
contract.
she...
she
was
a
beneficiary
of
the
contract,
surely.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
contract
actions
were
original
tort
actions.
it's
easy
to
characterize
a
contract
action
as
a
tort
action.
right?
it's
just
assumpsit.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i'm
not
sure
a
whole
lot
hangs
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
respondent
is
a
paraplegic
who
suffered
serious
injuries
when
after
being
arrested
he
was
transported
to
a
kansas
city
police
station
in
a
van
that
was
not
equipped
to
accommodate
wheelchairs.
he
sued
petitioner
police
officers
and
other
officials
for
discriminating
against
him
on
the
basis
of
his
disability
in
violation
of
section
202
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
of
1990,
and
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973
by
failing
to
maintain
appropriate
policies
for
the
arrest
and
transportation
of
persons
with
spinal
cord
injuries.
a
jury
awarded
him
compensatory
and
punitive
damages,
but
the
district
court
vacated
as
to
the
punitive
holding
that
they
are
unavailable
in
private
suits
brought
under
section
202
and
section
504.
in
reversing,
the
eighth
circuit
found
punitive
damages
available
under
the
general
rule
of
one
of
our
cases
called
franklin
versus
gwinnett
county
public
schools
which
stated
that
“absent
clear
direction
to
the
contrary
by
congress,
the
federal
courts
have
the
power
to
award
any
appropriate
relief
for
violation
of
a
federal
right.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
section
2
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
prohibits
discrimination
against
the
disable
by
public
entities.
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
prohibits
discrimination
against
the
disabled
by
recipients
of
federal
fundings
including
private
organizations.
both
sections
are
enforceable
through
private
causes
of
action
and
the
statutes
say
that
the
remedies
available
are
those
available
in
a
private
action
under
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
so,
that
shifts
our
whole
case
over
to
title
vi.
title
vi
invokes
congress’
spending
clause
power
to
place
conditions
on
the
grant
of
federal
funds.
this
court
has
regularly
applied
a
contract
clause
analogy
in
defining
the
scope
of
conduct
for
which
funding
recipients
may
be
held
liable
in
money
damages
and
in
finding
a
damages’
remedy
available
for
private
suits.
the
same
analogy
applies,
we
think,
in
determining
the
scope
of
damages’
remedies.
under
spending
clause
legislation,
a
remedy
is
appropriate
relief
only
if
the
recipient
is
on
notice
that
by
accepting
federal
funding,
it
exposes
itself
to
such
liability,
and
a
funding
recipient
is
generally
on
notice
that
it
is
subject
only
to
those
remedies
explicitly
provided
in
the
relevant
legislation
and
to
those
traditionally
available
in
breach
of
contract
suits.
since
title
vi
mentions
no
remedies
and
since
punitive
damages
are
generally
not
available
for
breach
of
contract,
punitive
damages
are
not
available
under
title
vi.
nor
could
it
be
said
that
title
vi
funding
recipients
have
by
merely
accepting
the
funds
implicitly
consented
to
a
remedy
which
is
not
normally
available
for
contract
actions
in
the
indetermitent
magnitude
of
which
could
produce
liablity
far
exceeding
the
level
of
federal
funding
that
they
have
accepted.
to
make
the
final
connection,
since
punitive
damages
may
not
be
awarded
in
private
suits
brought
under
title
vi,
it
follows
that
they
may
not
be
awarded
in
suits
brought
under
section
202
of
the
ada
and
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
