mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
statutes
at
issue
in
this
case,
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
and
title
ii
of
the
ada,
do
not
sanction
the
award
of
punitive
damages
which
are,
by
their
definition,
damages
in
excess
of
that
necessary
to
make
good
any
wrong
done.
now,
there
are
several...
both
section
504
and
title
ii
derive
their
remedies
expressly
from
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
which
operates
as
a
condition
on
the
receipt
of
federal
financial
assistance.
and
it
seems
to
me
that...
to
us
that
there
are
several
facets
of
the
title
vi
statutory
scheme
which
make
it
particularly
inappropriate
to
infer
a
punitive
damages
remedy.
the
first
is,
is
that
title
vi,
although
it's
silent
with
respect
to
a
compensatory
remedy,
expressly
provides
for
punitive
and
regulatory
measures
in
the
event
that
the
violation
of
its
nondiscrimination
provision.
in
particular,
the
statute
provides
for
a
termination
of
federal
funding,
which
this
court
has
itself
recognized
is
a
very
severe...
severe
remedy
that
can
have
a
powerful
deterrent
effect.
in
addition,
the
statute
authorizes
administrative
enforcement
actions,
actions
that...
in
which
the
regulatory
agencies,
who
have
responsibility
for
enforcing
section
504
and
title
ii,
can
take
remedial
action,
order
remedial
action,
short
of
funding
termination.
now,
the
second
aspect
of
title
vi
and
title
vi
statutory
scheme
it
seems
to
us
to
be
quite
pertinent
is
that
punitive
damages
are
themselves
antithetical
to
spending
clause
legislation
like
title
vi
because
the
availability
of
unbounded
punitive
damages
awards
can
actually
have
the
effect
of
diverting
resources
from
achieving
the
important
objectives
of
the
underlying
spending
programs.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
think
the
court
addressed
that
in
passing
in
the
carlson
v.
green
case,
and
we
think
that
that...
the
discussion
of
punitive
damages
in
that
case
is
properly
regarded
as...
as
dictum
in
that
case.
but...
but--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes,
but
there
are
two
distinctions
between
bivens
and
this
case.
first,
in
the
bivens
context,
there
aren't
statutory
penal
and
regulatory
measures
that
can
be
used
like
funding
termination
or
administrative
enforcement
actions
to
take
deterrence
measures
when...
when
needed
to
deter
violations.
and
second,
in
the
bivens
context,
this
court
is
giving
effect
to
a
constitutional
tort
that
it
alone
has
recognized.
in...
in
this
context,
the
court
is
purporting
to
ascertain
congress's
intent
in
enacting
section
504
in
title
ii.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that...
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and...
and
first
of
all,
if
i
can
make
two
points...
first,
in
that
context,
again,
there
is
no
express
statutory
penal
or
regulatory
measures
that
congress
created
to
provide
deterrence
as
it
did
under
title
vi,
the
remedies
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
secondly,
what's
important,
we
think,
about
the
smith
case,
in
which
this
court
recognized
a
punitive
damages
remedy
under
section
1983...
is
that
in
that
case,
the
court
didn't
start
with
the
presumption
that
punitive
damages
were
available
and
simply
look
to
see
if
congress
had
said
otherwise.
and
that's
the
presumption
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
in
this
case.
instead,
the
court
purported
to
engage
in
an
inquiry
of
congress's
intent
and...
and
focused
on
the
fact
that
when...
when
congress
enacted
section
1983,
it
made
very
clear
that
it
was
adopting
a
special
species
of
tort
liability
looking
to
the...
the
state
common
law
at
the
time
which
provided
for
punitive
damages
there.
so,
we
think
that
the
section
1983
case
is
quite
different
than
this
case.
the
court--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
first
of
all,
it
does
happen.
it
happened
in
the
grove
city
case
that
came
here,
and
i
could
point
your
honor
to
additional
examples
in
which
the
termination
funding
mechanism
has
been
used.
now,
to
be
sure,
it...
it's
an
unusual
remedy
and
it's
a
harsh
remedy,
and
simply
because
it's
not
used
in
more
cases
doesn't
mean
that
it
doesn't
have
a
deterrent
effect.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes.
i
could
point
you
to...
to
one
case.
it's...
it's
not
a
case
cited
in
the
brief.
it's
a
court
of
appeals
case,
freeman
v.
cavassos,
939
f.
2d
1527,
which
is
one
example.
but...
but
again,
the...
the
federal
government...
congress
gave
the
federal
government
and
the
federal
agencies
authority
to
enforce
these
provisions
short
of
funding
termination.
the...
the
agencies
receive
thousands
of
complaints
each
year
under
title
ii
and
section
504.
and
they
investigate
those
complaints
commeasurate
with
the
seriousness
of
the
allegations
raised
in
those
complaints,
and
they
are
successful
in
negotiating
compliance
agreements,
ranging
from
informal
agreements
to
formal
settlement
agreements,
in
which
those
alleged
to...
to
have
engaged
in
discrimination
agree
to
take
corrective
measures
to
eliminate
discrimination
and,
in
some
cases,
to
pay
monetary
sums.
now,
the...
the
federal
agencies
have
entered
into
more
300
of
those
agreements
under
title
ii
alone
in
the
past
8
years.
so,
there
is
an
administrative
process
in
place.
it's
statutory...
statutorily
created
by
congress,
and
we
think
that
that
process
itself
counsels
heavily
against
judicial
inference
of
punitive
damages.
or
in
addition,
to
return
to
the...
the
court's
franklin
case,
the
franklin
case
is
grounded
on
the
notion
that
the
federal
courts
have
the
authority
to
provide
a
remedy
when
necessary
to
make
good
the
wrong
done.
that
principle
has
no
application
to
and
has
never
been
extended
to
punitive
damages.
it
would
be
a
quantum
leap
for
this
court
to
extend
the
franklin
principle
to
punitive
damages.
punitive
damages,
the
court
has
recognized,
are
both
quasi-criminal,
unpredictable,
and
at
times
have
a
devastating
effect.
those
characteristics
of
punitive
damages
make
them
uniquely
suited
for
careful
legislative
judgment.
congress
in
section
504
and
title
ii
has
not
made
any
legislative
judgment
that
punitive
damages
should
be
available,
and
therefore,
this
court
should
reverse
the
decision
below.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
