justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
suppose
it's
not
like
an
immunity
from
suit
that
can
be
waived.
it's...
we
use
the
term
immunity,
but
it's
not
that
sort
of
immunity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
did
the
compensatory
damages
in
this
case
include
damages
for
humiliation,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in...
in
this...
is
the
jury
instructed
in
this
jurisdiction
that
compensatory
damages
include
damages?
of
course,
pain
and
suffering,
but
is
that
also
humiliation?
i
thought
humiliation
was
covered
as
part
of
the
compensatory
award.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
guess
it...
it
goes
to
the
make-whole
point.
assume
a
jurisdiction
where
humiliation
is
not
part
of
the
compensatory
award,
could
the
argument
be
made,
well,
in
order
to
make
the
person
whole,
you
must
give
punitive
damages
because
it
includes
damages
for
humiliation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
i
want
you
to
assume...
and
i
believe
this
is
the
law
in
many
jurisdictions...
that
punitive
damages
are
given
in
part
to
ease
the...
the...
it's
smart
money
in
order
to
ease
the...
the
pain
that
the
person
suffers,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
tell
me.
i
just
can't
recall.
have
we
held
that
punitive
damages
are
available
on
the
bivens
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
do...
do
i
infer
from
your...
from
your
response
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
department
that
punitive
damages
should
not
be
awarded
in
bivens
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
appropriate
relief
does
not
sound
to
me
to
be
consistent
with
your
beginning
premise
which
was
that
unless
congress
forecloses
the
remedy,
we
must
give
it.
