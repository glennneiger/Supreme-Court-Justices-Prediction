mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
eighth
circuit
held
in
this
case
that
a
private
plaintiff
may
obtain
punitive
damages
in
an
action
brought
against
municipal
government
defendants
under
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973
and
title
ii
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
although
the
court
of
appeals
identified
substantial
evidence
in
the
legislative
record
that
congress
never
intended
this
result,
it
thought
that
this
court's
decision
in
franklin
against
gwinnett
county
public
schools
left
it
little
or
no
choice
in
the
matter.
as
the
eighth
circuit
read
franklin,
once
a
cause
of
action
has
been
created
or
inferred,
it
presumptively
carries
with
it
all
common
law
remedies,
including
punitive
damages,
unless
congress
has
specifically
said
otherwise.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
the...
the
party--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--in
the
lower
court,
my
client
took
the
position
that
it
was,
in
fact,
an
arm
of
the
state,
not
an
arm
of
the
municipal
government.
for
various
factors...
it
cited
various
factors
that
in
its
view
warranted
an
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
not
a
city
of
newport
immunity.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
decision
being
reviewed
before
this
court
today,
rejected
that
argument.
we
have
not
separately
sought
certiorari
on
that
decision.
but
i...
i
do
want
to
add
on
that
point,
justice
o'connor,
that
in
our
view
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
take
respondent's
suggestion
that
because
my
client
took
that
position
in
the
lower
court,
that
this
court
should
therefore
turn
a
blind
eye
to
the
city
of
newport
doctrine.
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
quite
analogous
to
a
situation
in
which
a
litigant,
for
example,
decided
to
argue
only
legislative
history
in
the
lower
court
and
then
before
this
court...
and
then
someone
said,
well,
you're
therefore
constrained
not
to
look
at
the
words
of
the
statute.
that
seems--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--it
does
not
change
the
issue.
the
position
the
client
took
below
was
always
that
punitive
damages
are
unwarranted
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
including
a
reason
that
we
are
now
urging
by
virtue
of
the
client
having
lost
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
issue
below.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
exactly.
it...
it
is
exactly
the
sense
in
which
it
was
used
in
city
of
newport
as
a
background
principle
of
law
that
congress
is
assumed
to
have
taken
into
consideration
in
enacting
the
actual
test.
and
we--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i...
i
think
counsel
could
have
taken
that
measure.
they
didn't,
but
i
don't
think
that
it...
that
that
amounts
to
a
waiver.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
the
answer,
justice
breyer,
is
that
we
have
urged
both
arguments.
i
think
we...
we
could
prevail
on
the
basis
of
either
presumption.
i...
i
would,
however,
tell
you
why
i
think
the
court
ought
to
address
the
broader
issue
and
that
is
because,
given
the
construction
of
franklin
that
the
eighth
circuit
took
in
this
case,
there
is
no
good
reason
to
believe
that
were
city
of
newport
called
to
their
attention,
they
would
have
come
out
any
differently.
the
eighth
circuit
took
franklin
to
say
that
unless...
given
that
there's
a
cause
of
action,
whether
explicit...
whether
express
or
implied,
that
must
necessarily
carry
with
it
all
common
law
remedies
unless
congress
has
said
otherwise,
which
it
rarely
does--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
think
that...
that's
the
language
from
franklin.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
and
we
think
franklin
is
properly
confined
to
compensatory
remedies
for
the
reasons
we've
said
in
the
brief.
the
eighth
circuit's
view
of
appropriate,
however,
your
honor,
was
that
it
is
synonymous
with
whatever
the
common
law
has
traditionally
made
available
by
virtue
of
state
law,
by
virtue
of
federal
law,
by
virtue
of
the
entire
corpus
of
law.
and
whatever
you
can
find
on
the
books
is,
therefore,
appropriate
within
the
meaning
of
franklin,
as
the
eighth
circuit
saw
it,
and
that,
justice
breyer,
to
return
to
your
question,
is
a
doctrine
of
enormous
capacity.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i...
i
think
it
does.
if--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--let
me
say
two
things
with
respect
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
first
of
all,
the
last
thing
i
want
to
do
is
talk
the
court
out
of
ruling
for
my
client
on
any
ground.
[laughter]
so,
if
the
court
believes
city
of
newport
is
sufficient...
and
we
think
it's
quite
powerful...
we'll
certainly
be
glad
of
that
result.
but
let
me
say
two
more
things
about
it.
the
first
is
even
city
of
newport
requires
looking
to
the
next
step
and
asking,
okay,
that's
the
presumption.
it's
a
strong
presumption.
is
there
specific
evidence
in
the
statute
that
overcomes
it?
for
all
the
reasons
we've
said
in
the
brief
and
i'd
be
glad
to
turn
to,
the
evidence
in
this
statute
is
quite
extraordinarily
compelling
that,
to
the
contrary,
punitive
damages
were
foreclosed.
second,
i...
i
wish
i
could
be
as
confident
as
the
court's...
as
your
honor's
question
suggests,
that
were
this
case
to
return
to
the
eighth
circuit
with
nothing
but
a
ruling
about
city
of
newport,
you
know,
in
its
sails,
that
the
eighth
circuit
would
take
that
mandate
and
take
it
and...
and
come
out
differently.
i'm
not
quite
so
confident
about
that
because
of
the
sweep
of
how
they
read
franklin.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no.
quite...
quite
the
contrary.
the
question
presented
is
what
do
these
statutes
mean
after
all.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
right,
and
i
might
say
one
of
the
matters
we've
pointed
to
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
is,
in
fact,
that
this
misconstruction
of
franklin
is
not
confined
to
this
case,
to
this
statute,
and
certainly
to
the
eighth
circuit.
it
is
a
wide-ranging,
i
think,
over-reading
of
what
this
court
said...
not
just
meant,
but
said...
in
franklin
itself.
and
perhaps
i
might
just
turn
briefly
to
that
initial
question.
it
seems
to
us,
for
several
reasons,
the
eighth
circuit
has
badly
misunderstood
what
franklin
says.
it
doesn't
cover
punitive
damages.
that's
the
short
of
the
matter.
punitive
damages
were,
after
all,
not
sought
by
the
plaintiff
in
franklin,
but
more
to
the
point,
the
premise
of
franklin
against
gwinnett
county
was
drawn
from
bell
against
hood
and
the
cases
that
underlie
bell
against
hood,
and
that
is
an
explicitory,
compensatory
rationale.
the
idea
in
bell
was
that
courts
have
an
authority--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
good
heavens,
i
hope
not.
[laughter]
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
what...
what
i
certainly
meant
to
say
is
that
bell
and
hood
stem
from
a
line
of
authority
that
says
that
courts
have
the
authority,
the
inherent
authority
i...
i
had
meant
to
say,
when...
when
charged
with
the
construction
of
a
statute
to
make
good
the
wrong
done.
and
that
is
about
as
clear
a
statement
of
a
compensatory
rationale
as
you
could
have.
franklin
did
not
suggest
that
a
plaintiff
who
has
been
made
whole,
as
mr.
gorman
was
to
the
tune
of
$1
million
in
compensatory
damages,
including
$150,000
in
pain
and
suffering,
has
a
right
inferable
through
a
statute
that
speaks
not
a
word
to
the
matter,
to
an
additional
presumption
of
punishment.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i...
i
do
not...
i
have
not
seen
an
indication
that
it
included
that.
i--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i...
we
have
included
the
instruction,
justice
kennedy,
at
page
72
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
i
do
not
find
a
specific
reference
to
that.
i'd
be
glad
to
see
if
i
can--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
guess
i'd
be
inclined
to...
to
think
about
that
in
a
case
in
which
somebody
had
argued
that
below
or
here.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
but...
but--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--right.
i...
i
don't
want
to
quarrel
with
the
hypothetical,
justice
kennedy.
it
may
very
well
be
that
pain
and
suffering
already
embraces
that
concept.
in
many
jurisdictions,
pain
and
suffering
is
not
compensable
as
a
compensatory
damages.
and
it
may
be
that
in
the
jurisdictions
to
which
your
honor
adverts,
punitive
damages
are
used
to
supplement
a
compensatory
regime
that
falls
short
of
pain
and
suffering,
which
is
not
the
case
here.
this
man
received
$150,000--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--for
the
category
called
pain
and
suffering
and
he
was
made
whole.
and
there's
no
suggestion
that
he
wasn't
made
whole.
the
suggestion
is
that
my
clients
should
be
punished,
and
that
is
something
as
to
which
the
statute
provides
absolutely
no--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
precisely
because
this
is
not
a
common
law
action.
this
is
a
federal
statute--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--as
to
which--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
as
to
which
congress
has
spoken.
it
has
adopted
title
vi
remedies
that
are
quite
robust,
which
come
with
title
vi
regulations
that
are
enormously
detailed,
freighted
with
due...
levels
of
due
process
that
are
quite
unusual.
and
yet,
we
propose
to
overlay
a
punitive
damages
remedy
that
comes
with
none
of
those
protections.
it
would
work
an
extraordinary
anomaly
to
layer
punitive
damages
on
a
regime
like
this.
this
is
not,
after
all,
a
question
that
is
committed
to
the
courts
like
some
of
those
doctrines.
the
parole
evidence
rule
may
in
some
jurisdictions
have
originally
been
enacted
or
not.
but
the
fact
is
this
is
a
statute,
and
congress
spoke
rather
clearly
to
what
it...
it
wanted
the
statute
to
accomplish.
and
some
of
the
things
it
expressly
said
cannot
live
with
the
things
that
respondent
proposes
to
import
into
it.
and
let
me
just
say
one
other
thing,
and
i
noticed
that
my
white
light
on,
as...
i
do
want
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
this
is
also
a
spending
clause
statute,
and
i
know
this
gets
back
to
a...
a
threshold
issue
that
both
your
honor
and
justice
ginsburg
suggested
perhaps
the
court
could
pretermit.
i
think
it
would
be
a
mistake,
given
that
the
task
is
to
construe
the
statute,
to
ignore
the
fact
that
it
was
enacted
pursuant
to
a
contractual
regime
in
which
punitive
damages
historically
and
for
a
variety
of
sensible
reasons
are
especially
inappropriate.
and
if
there
are
no
questions,
i...
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
turn...
go
back
for
just
a
moment
to
the
1991
act
because
i
think
its...
its
significance
here
is
terribly
important
and
quite
a
bit
different
from
respondent's
characterization.
the
1991
act
amended
title
i
of
the
ada
and
also
the
rehabilitation
act
to
provide
a
capped
punitive
damages
remedy
available
only
to...
only
to
nongovernmental
entities.
this
case
obviously
involves
an
uncapped
award,
indeed
an
award
four
times
the
size
of
the
cap,
applied
only
to
governmental
entities
and
not
in
an
employment
setting.
that's
more
than
simply
anomalous.
it
is,
i
think,
completely
implausible
for
reasons
that
i
think
go
beyond
what...
what
mr.
nelson
has
described
to
you.
the
fact
is
title
i
was
enacted
in
its
original
form
at
the
very
same
time
that
congress
was
considering
the
1991
legislation.
everyone
in
congress
knew
that
when
they
enacted
in
title
i
that
there
shall
be
the
same
remedies
as
title
vii...
everyone
knew
that
at
that
very
moment
laying
before
another
committee
in
congress
was
the
very
legislation
that
is
being
characterized
as
the
1991
legislation,
as
if
it
happened
much
later.
these
happened
simultaneously
and
everyone
knew
that
punitive
damages
were
around
the
corner.
in
my
view,
when
you
look
at
what
mr.
nelson
called
the
timing
of
the
enactments,
you
really
have
to
read
title
i
as
if
it
enacted
a
punitive
damages
and
capped
and
targeted
and
calibrated.
title
iii
also
has
a
penalty
provision.
although
it
forbids
punitive
damages,
to
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
it
has
a
civil
penalties
provision.
so,
the
thing
that
is
remarkable
about
respondent's
position
and
the
position
you
would
be
urged
to
adopt
is
that
although
title
i
of
the
ada
has
a
limited
punitive
damages
provision
applicable
only
to
employment
cases
and
exempting
the
government,
and
although
title
iii
has
a
civil
penalties
provision
applicable
only
to
public
accommodations,
title
ii,
which
is
silent,
shall
have
an
unlimited
punitive
damages
provision
which
can
be
applied
against
governmental
entities.
and
it
is
against
governmental
entities
and
only
governmental
entities
that
title
ii
applies.
and
city
of
newport,
i
should
add,
doesn't
change
just
how
anomalous
that
is.
the
rehabilitation
act
amendments
go
not
one
step
in
the
direction
of
overturning
city
of
newport.
the
rehabilitation
act
amendments
say
only
this,
that
the
states
shall
be
liable
for
whatever
remedies
are
applicable
to
other
public
entities
or
private
entities.
it
doesn't
tell
us
what
those
shall
be,
and
in
our
view
punitive
damages
aren't
available
against
anybody
under
title
ii.
so,
it...
it
hardly
advances
respondent's
position
to
say
that
there
shall
be
applicable
to
the
states
whatever
is
applicable
to
anyone
else.
the
other
thing
is,
what
are
those
other
public
entities
if
not,
among
other
things,
municipal
governments
like
my
client?
by
carving
out,
in
other
words,
municipal
governments,
the
1986
amendment
is
a
very
strange
way
to
overrule
the
doctrine
in...
in
city
of
newport,
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
it
does
no
such
thing.
let
me...
let
me
end
with
this
point.
and
we
haven't...
we
haven't
mentioned
the
history
of
judicial
interpretation
of
title
vi
and
section
504,
which
had
never...
never,
not
once...
ever
been
construed
to
permit
punitive
damages
at
any
of
the
times
in
history
that
these
statutes
were
meticulously
amended
and...
and
previous
remedy
provisions
incorporated
going
forward.
but
i
do
want
to
end
with
where
mr.
nelson
began.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
perhaps
not.
[laughter]
