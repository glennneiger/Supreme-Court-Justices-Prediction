mr.
scott
l.
nelson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
issue
of
whether
congress
foreclosed
awards
of
punitive
damages
when
it
enacted
the
rights
of
action
to
enforce
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
and
title
ii
of
the
ada
which
together
prohibit
discrimination
against
people
with
disabilities
in
the
provision
of
public
services.
the
text,
structure,
policies,
and
legislative
history
of
the
ada
disclose
no
prohibition
on
the
award
of
punitive
damages.
absent
such
a
prohibition--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
justice
o'connor,
is
no.
had
the
defendants
wished
to
preserve
the
ability
to
argue
for
immunity
on
city
of
newport,
they
were
free
to
do
so
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
no,
i
don't
say--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--you're
precluded
from
it.
it's...
it's
a--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--yes.
i...
i
do
intend
to
deal
with
that.
i'd
like
to
start
by
dealing
with...
with
the
issue
of
whether
there's
a
punitive
damages
remedy
at
all
because
i
think
then
the
newport
issue
really
is
secondary
to
that.
and
the
starting
point
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
punitive
damages
i
think
has
to
be
this
court's
decision
in
franklin.
and
it's
useful
i
think
to,
instead
of
looking
at...
at
arguments
about
what
underlies
franklin,
to
look
at
what
franklin
said.
quote:
"the
general
rule,
therefore,
is
that
absent
clear
direction
to
the
contrary
by
congress,
the
federal
courts
have
the
power
to
award
any
appropriate
relief
in
a
cognizable
cause
of
action
brought
pursuant
to
a
federal
statute.
"
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
punitive
damage
was...
was
not
the
form
of
relief
that
was
being
addressed
in
franklin.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well,
i
certainly
don't
mean
to
say
that...
that
in
any
particular
case,
the
court
must
give
it
unless
congress
forecloses
it,
but
if
congress
has
not
foreclosed
it,
it's
potentially
available
if,
in
view
of
the
policies
of...
of
the
particular
statute,
it's
an
appropriate
remedy
and
in
view
of
the
conduct
that's
being
addressed.
specifically,
under
this
court's
decisions,
punitive
damages
are
an
appropriate
remedy
where
there's
willful...
a
willful
violation
or
reckless
disregard
of...
of
the
legal
entitlements
of
the
plaintiff.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well,
there...
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
is
that
the
touchstone
is
not
simply
504,
but
also
the
ada,
which
is
not
a
spending
clause
enactment
at
all.
the
second
is
that--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--to
the
extent
that...
that
what
it...
what
it
says
is
that
the
remedies
available,
the
remedies
being
a
private
right
of
action...
and
that
does
not
necessarily,
however,
import
a
limitation
imposed
on
that
remedy
from
above
by
the
spending
clause
that
doesn't
inhere
in
the...
in
the
nature
of
the
statute
itself,
assuming
that
the
spending
clause
does
impose
that
limitation,
which
i
don't
concede,
and
i'll
get
to
in
a
moment.
but
this
court
actually
addressed
a
similar
situation
in
the
darrone
case.
the
issue
there
was
the
remedies
available
under
section
504
for
a
case
of
employment
discrimination,
and
504
in
turn
incorporates
the
remedies
available
under
title
vi.
title
vi
said
there
is
no
remedy
available
for
employment
discrimination
under
title
vi
except
with
regard
to
a
federal
program
where
the
funding
is
for
employment
purposes.
this
court
said
that
by
incorporating
the
title
vi
remedies,
section
504
did
not
incorporate
that
limitation
on
the
remedial
scheme
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
policies
underlying
section
504
which
were
to
eliminate
discrimination
against
the
handicapped
more
broadly.
similarly,
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act,
the...
the
purpose
of
that
act
is
to
extend
even
further
than
504
the
prohibition
on
and
the
remedies
for
discrimination
against
persons
with
disabilities.
and
to
import
into
that
statutory
scheme
a
limit
on
relief
that...
that
would
pull
it
back
and...
and
restrict
it
to
what's
appropriate
on
a
spending
clause
measure
would
be
inappropriate
under,
i
think,
the
mode
of
analysis
this
court
used
in
darrone.
but
in
any
event,
even
if
one
looks
only
at
section
504,
the
spending
clause
analogy
to
contract
doesn't
limit
remedies
available
to
contractual
remedies.
this
court
i
think
made
clear,
both
in
franklin
and
then
more
recently
in
davis
v.
monroe
county,
that
although
the
obligation
that
an
entity
may
undertake
under
the
spending
clause
is
contractual
in
the
sense
that
it's
voluntary
and
it
has
to
be
clearly
stated
what
the
substantive
requirements
you're
subjecting
yourself
to
when
you
accept
federal
funding
are,
that
that
does
not
carry
with
it
the
notion
that
you're
limited
to
a,
quote,
"contract"
remedy.
in
davis,
what
the
plaintiff
sought
in
her
complaint
was
punitive
and
compensatory
damages
for
injuries
that
had
been
inflicted
on
her.
she,
of
course,
was
not
a
party
to
any
contract.
what
she
was
seeking
was
quintessentially
a
tort
recovery,
and
this
court
held
in
davis
that
as
long
as
the
requirement
that
the
conduct
was
intentional,
it
was
a
violation
that
was...
that...
that
a
person
in
authority
had
knowledge
of
and
had...
had
allowed
the
situation
to
go
forward,
that
if
those
conditions,
which
were
spending
clause
conditions
under
the
gebser
decision...
if
those
conditions
were
met,
you
could
go
forward
and
obtain
the
type
of
tort
remedial
relief
that
the
plaintiff
was--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
you
could,
i
suppose,
analogize
her
to
a
third
party
beneficiary,
but
to
suggest
that--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
and
in
fact--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--that...
that
argument
can
go
the
other
way,
too,
because
the
states
are
broadly
recognizing
that...
that
malicious
and
bad
faith
breaches
of
contract
carry
with
them
tort
remedies.
but
i'll
give
another
example.
this
court
in
a
couple
of
decisions,
wright
v.
roanoke
housing
authority,
and
wilder
v.
virginia
hospital
association,
held
that
under
spending
clause
enactments,
obligations
can
be
imposed
on
the
recipients
of
funds
that
are
enforceable
that
create
enforceable
rights
under
section
1983.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held,
most
recently
i
think
in
city
of
monterey
v.
del
monte
dunes,
that
1983
is
ever
and
always
a
tort
remedy.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
it's
under
title
i
that
the
caps
apply,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
that
what
that
illustrates
is
not...
not
the
point
that...
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
provide
these
remedies.
you
have
to
look
at...
at
the
timing
of
the
enactments
and
the
background
of
those
changes
to
the...
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991.
as
the
ada
was
originally
enacted,
title
i,
consonant
with
title
vii,
didn't
provide
a
damages
remedy
of
any
kind.
it
didn't
provide
an
entitlement
to
any
legal
forms
of
relief.
it
was
limited
to
equitable
relief
following
the...
the
title
vii
model.
no
such
limitation
has
ever
been
placed
on
title
ii.
in
title
ii,
congress
simply
incorporated
by
reference
an
action
for
legal
remedies
that
this
court
had
already
recognized
to
exist.
now,
then
in
1991,
congress
expanded
the
relief
under
title
i
of
the
ada,
as
well
as
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
for
the
first
time
ever
to
allow
a
damages
remedy,
either
compensatory
or
punitive,
for
employment
discrimination
to
which
those
statutes
applied.
and
what
that
illustrates
is
simply
the
history
that
congress
has
been
very
wary
about
providing
broad
damages
remedies
in
the
employment
discrimination
area
and
in
1981,
it
relaxed
that
unwillingness
to
some
degree,
but
then
placed
a
cap
on
it.
but
in
title
ii,
it's
quite
clear,
from
the
original
1990
legislation,
that
congress
didn't
impose
that
circumscribed
set
of
employment
discrimination
remedies
on
title
ii.
so,
by
expanding
title
i,
that
doesn't
either
limit
title
ii
or
imply
that
title
ii
was
ever
intended
to
be
limited.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
title
iii
says
no
punitive
damages
at
all
as
part
of
a...
of
a
remedial
scheme
that
is
similarly
circumscribed
to...
to
title
i,
although
in
somewhat
different
ways,
a
remedial
scheme
that
under
title
iii
doesn't
make
a
private
right
of
action
for
damages
of
any
kind
available
to
an
individual
plaintiff.
under
title
iii,
it's
only
the
attorney
general
who
can
ever
sue
for
any
damages,
and
then
when
congress...
it...
having
made
a...
a
damages
remedy
available
to
the
attorney
general,
it
then
went
on
to
say,
and
under
this
statute,
damages
doesn't
include
punitive
damages.
i
think
to
the
extent
that
sheds
any
light
on
title
ii
at
all,
we
know
that
in
title
ii,
congress
knew
that
it
was
creating
a
damages
remedy.
that
it
didn't
limit
those
damages,
as
it
did
in
title
iii,
when
it
created
that
limited
damages
remedy
through
the
attorney
general,
is,
if
anything,
an
indication
that
no
limitation
was
intended.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
that's
correct.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
i
think
the...
part
of
the
answer
to
that
is
the
whole
structure
of
the
ada
remedial
scheme
indicates
an
intention
to
make
broader
remedies
available
against
public
entities
than
private
entities
to
begin
with.
that's
why,
when
the
ada
was
originally
enacted,
there
were
all
these
limits
placed
on
title
iii,
no
compensatory
damages
even,
limits
on
title
i
against
private
and
public
employers,
not
even
any
compensatory
damages.
clearly,
in
title
ii,
everyone
agrees
that
congress
made
available
a
remedy
there
that
is
much
more
extensive
than
it
made
against
private
employers
or
private
offerors
of
public
accommodations.
now,
why
congress
did
that
i
think
is...
is
perhaps
somewhat
obscure,
but
it
seems
to
relate
back
to
the
entire
history,
starting
with
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
where
congress
was
very
hesitant
about
imposing
broad
remedies
against
private
actors,
possibly
in
part
due
to
the...
the
effectiveness
of
their
lobbyists,
which...
which
may
have
been
greater
in
this
instance
than
those
of...
of
public
employers
and
entities.
but
for
whatever
reason
congress
did
it,
it's
clear
that
congress
did
enact
broader
remedies
under
title
ii
than
under
those
titles
that
are
applicable
to--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--correct.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
no,
they
are
not.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well,
that...
that
was...
that
was
what
happened
in
the
1991
round.
presumably
the...
the
congress
there
obviously
did
made...
make
a
considered
choice
not
to
impose
those
remedies
on...
on
public
actors.
but
i
think,
you
know,
to
step
back
even
further,
one
has
to
look
at
the
fact
that
both
section
504,
by
virtue
of
the
1986
rehabilitation
act
amendments,
and
the
ada,
by
virtue
of...
of
section
502,
are
subject
as
a
general
rule
to
the
principle
that...
that
congress
very
deliberately
said
public
entities,
and
in
particular
states,
are
going
to
be
subject
to
the
full
range
of
remedies
that
are
available
against
private
defendants.
congress
did
that
explicitly
in
both
those...
both
those
statutes.
and
i
think
what
that
indicates
is
that
there
has
been
a
considered
judgment
in
these
statutes
that,
especially
in
the
area
of
the
provision
of
public
services,
congress
wants
broad
remedies
to
be
made
available
against
the
public
entities
that
are
subject
to
it.
it's
true
that
congress
made
a
different
judgment
in
1991
when
it
extended
the...
the
remedies
for
employment
discrimination.
but
except
for
that
provision
of
the
statute
where
public
employers
were
given
a
special
exemption,
the
rest
of
the
statute
evinces
an...
an
intention
by
congress
that
public
entities
not
get
special
exemptions.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well,
i
think
it...
it
seems...
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
one
can
look
at
it
either
way.
it's
perverse
if
you're
a
public
entity;
it's
not
perverse
if
you're
a
business
entity
that
feels
like
anti-discrimination
laws
trench
on
the...
the
freedom
of
businesses
to
operate
in
the
way
they
want
to
operate.
i
think
what
congress
has
done
with
respect
to
discrimination
against
persons
with
disabilities,
first
in
making
the
504
remedies
available
against
recipients
of
federal
funds,
and
then
in
making
the
title
ii
remedies
available
against
public
entities,
is...
is
congress
has
made
a
judgment
that
says,
we
think
discrimination
against
persons
with
disabilities
is
particularly
objectionable
when
engaged
in
by
the
government,
just
as
in
the
fourth--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--that's
certainly
true.
and...
and
what
i
think
is
distinctive
about
newport,
to
begin
with,
here
i
do
believe
that...
that
if
the
court
were
to
considered
that
under
these
statutes
there
is
a
punitive
damages
remedy
available
generally,
and
then
the
question
is
should
these
particular
defendants
be
freed
from
it
under
a
city
of
newport
rationale,
that...
that
it's
fair
for
this
court
to
hold
the...
the
defendant
to
the
rule
that
it
generally
applies,
which
is
that
if
you
want
to
argue
something
like
that,
raise
an
issue
like
that,
you
should
do
it
in
the
lower
courts.
but
even
looking
beyond
that,
what
we
have
in...
in
these
statutes
is
in
the--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--no,
i'm
not
making
that
argument.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
yes,
that
was
pointed
out
in
the
brief
in
opposition.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
yes.
i
think...
i
think
that...
that
the
first
response
is
that
through
the
rehabilitation
act
amendments
of
1986,
which
are
codified
at
42
u.s.c.,
section
2000(d)(7),
and
also
in
section
502
of
the
ada,
which
is
codified
at
42
u.s.c.,
section
12202,
those
provisions
are
fundamentally
incompatible
with
the
notion
of
newport
immunity.
and
i
want
to
just
start
by
expressing
my
understanding
of
what
newport
immunity
is
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in...
in
the
vermont
natural
resources
case.
it's
not
specifically
an
immunity
that
is
municipal
immunity.
it's
an
immunity
or
a...
or
a
general
presumption
against
awards
of
punitive
damages
against
state
and
local
governments
as
a
class.
and...
and
what
it
says
where
it
operates
is
that
those
defendants
as
a
class
have
an
exemption
against
a
particular
form
of
relief
that
is
otherwise
available
against
private
actors.
in
the
rehabilitation
act
amendments
and
in
section
502
of
the
ada,
what
congress
said
expressly
is
that
as
to
remedies
against
states,
which
are
one
of
the
entities
entitled
to
the
newport
presumption,
they're
subject
to
the
same
remedies
under
the
statutes
as
are
any
other
private
or
public
entities,
meaning
if
you
can
get
it
against
a
private
entity,
you
can
get
it
against
a
state.
and
that
takes
away
the
fundamental
premise
of
newport,
which
is
that
governmental
entities
as
a
class
are
entitled
to
a
special
exemption.
what
these
statutes
say
is
that
governmental
entities
as
a
class
are
entitled
to
no
special
exemption.
and
the
city
of
newport
issue
i
think
simply
goes
away.
i'd
also
suggest
that
one
of
the
fundamental
premises
of
city
of
newport
is
not
present
under
these
statutes,
and
that
is
that
there's
an
adequate
alternative
deterrent.
and...
and
in
this
case,
what
we're
talking
about
when
we're
talking
about
punitive
damages
as
a
deterrent,
to
answer
justice
kennedy's
question
earlier
of
mr.
robbins,
in
this
case
the
compensatory
damages
award
did
include
pain,
suffering,
humiliation,
and
mental
damages.
so,
we're
not
talking
about
punitive
damages
here
as
a
surrogate
for
some
component
of
compensatories.
we're
talking
about
it
as
a
remedy
designed
to
provide
a
deterrent
that
will
assist
in...
in
congress's
goal
of
eliminating
discrimination
against
persons
with
disabilities.
and
in...
in
newport,
this
court
looked
at
the
1983
remedy
and
said,
yes,
punitive
damages
are
an
important
element
of
deterrence
with
respect
to
civil
rights
violations
that
are
subject
to
section
1983.
but
we
have
a
better
deterrent
which
is
the
availability
of
punitive
damages
against
individual
defendants
who
actually
make
the
decisions
to
carry
out
the...
the
wrongful
acts
that
1983
is
responding
to.
now,
whether
that
judgment
is...
as
to
which
is
more
effective,
is
correct
or
not,
that's
the
line
the
court
drew
in
newport.
but
under
these
statutes,
that
remedy
is
not
available
because
section
504
and
title
ii
of
the
ada
make
quite
clear
that
they
provide
remedies
only
against
the
entities.
there's
no
right
of
action
against
a...
an
individual
under
title
ii
of
the
ada
or
under
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
so,
with
respect
to
these
statutes,
deterrence
against
the
entity
is
all
you've
got
and
all
you
can
rely
on.
and
that's
yet
another
reason
why
newport's
policies
are
inapplicable
here.
and
newport
was
very
clear
that
beyond
looking
at
the
immunity,
as...
as
it
used
the
term,
of
municipalities
as
a...
as
a
sort
of
standard
to
try
to
determine
what
the
legislature
was
thinking
about
when
it
enacted
the
statute,
the
court
was
also
going
to
look
at
the
policies
of
the
particular
statutes
to
determine
whether
or
not
immunity
from
punitive
damages
accorded
with
those
policies.
and
given
the
distinctions
between
the
ada
and
section
504,
those
policies
are
not
served
here
by
immunizing
the...
the
defendants
against
punitive
damages
on...
under
a
newport
rationale.
i'd
also
like
to
get
back
for
a
moment,
if
i
could,
to
the...
the
notion
that
what's
going
on
in
franklin
is
limited
to
compensatory
remedies
and
that...
that
the
idea
of...
of
punitive
damages
as
one
of
the
normal
modes
of
relief
offered
by
the
federal
courts
is
not
really
what
the
court
was
talking
about
in
franklin.
i
think
that's
inconsistent
not
only
with
bivens
where
in
carlson
v.
green
this
court,
i
think,
held
that
punitive
damages
are
available
in
bivens
actions
because,
as
one
of
the
ordinary
remedial
mechanisms
available
to
the
federal
courts,
they
were
particularly
appropriate
for
the
redress
of
constitutional
violations.
the
reason
i
say
that
that's
a
holding
is
the
issue
in
carlson
was
not
whether
there
was
a...
a
right
of
action
for
any
relief
at
all
under
the
eighth
amendment.
it
was
conceded
that...
that
the
plaintiff
could
get
injunctive
relief
against
an
eighth
amendment
violation
if
there
was
a
pervasive--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
that's...
that
that's
quite
right
with
respect
to...
with
respect
to
the
evolution
of
this
court's
doctrine.
i
think
what
the
court
said,
in...
in
particular
in
sandoval,
was
that...
that
the
court
had
backed
away
from
the
notion
that
for
every
right,
there
has
to
be
a
remedy
and
had
gone
to
the...
the
court
v.
ash
notion,
that
what
we're
looking
for
when
we're
trying
to
determine
whether
a
right
of
action
exists
is
congressional
intent.
but
that
was
true
at
the
time
of...
of
franklin
as
well
and
the
court
in
franklin
said
that's
a
separate
question
from
what
relief
you
get
when
it's
conceded
that
there
is
a
right
of
action
to
begin
with.
and
similarly,
in
malesko,
this
court
said,
we're
not
going
to
recognize
a
right
of
action
against
this
particular
entity.
the
question,
when
it's
clear
that
congress
has
made
a
right
of
action
available,
as
it
is
here,
and
what
form
of
relief
is
appropriate,
is
a
different
matter.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that's
clearly...
that's
clearly
true.
and
the
question
that...
that
we
as...
as
lawyers
are
trying
to...
to
deal
with
is...
is
how,
in
light
of
changes
in
precedent
and...
and
changes
in
evolution
of
the
court's
doctrine
over
time,
what
aspects
can
we
pull
out
and...
and
hold
constant
or...
or
use
to
make
arguments
as
to
what
the
rule
remains.
and
to
me,
looking
at
franklin,
which
was
a
case
that...
first
of
all,
all
nine
justices
concurred
in
the
holding
at
the
time.
second,
it
came
at
a
point
where
this
court
had
already
evolved
far
away
from
the
every
right
must
have
a
remedy
doctrine
and
was
looking
very
specifically
at
whether
or
not
congress
had
intended
to
allow
a
right
of
action.
but
what
the
opinion
for
the
court
said
and
even
the
concurrence
said
was
when
it's
crystal
clear
that
congress
said
there's
a
right
of
action
here,
does...
do
we
infer
limits
on
our
ability
to
provide
appropriate
relief
when
congress
hasn't
given
us
guidance
on
that
subject?
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
has
certainly
held
that
punitive
damages
are
appropriate
in
implied
statutory
rights
of
action,
the
most
notable
being
section
1981
which,
unlike
section
1983,
is
an
implied
right
of
action.
section
1981
doesn't
say
anything
about
creating
a
right
for
anybody
to
go
in
and
get
enforcement,
and
the
court
has
held
not
only
is
there
a
right
of
action
there,
but
held
as
recently
as
the
pollard
case,
which
i
believe
was
last
year,
that
under
1981
the
scope
of
relief
includes
punitive
damages.
i
think
that
what
that
reflects
is
the
franklin
principle,
that
when
there's
a
cause
of
action,
when
it's
a
cause
of
action
such
as
these,
that
is,
essentially
a
tort
remedy,
that
the
traditional
range
of
relief
that's
appropriate
for
such
rights
is
provided.
and
that
range
of
relief
includes
punitive
damages.
and...
and
again,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
on
the
facts
punitive
damages
are
appropriate,
because
that
hasn't
yet
been
decided,
but
whether
ever
punitive
damages
are
appropriate
under
this
statute.
and
i
think
franklin
speaks
to
the
question
not
in
its
express
holding
but
its
rationale
which...
which
i
believe
has
survived
down
to
the
present.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
will
leave
it
at
that.
