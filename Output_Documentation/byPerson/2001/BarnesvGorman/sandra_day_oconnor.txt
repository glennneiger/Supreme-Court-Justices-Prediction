mr.
robbins,
did
any...
did
the
petitioners
raise
the
newport
case
at
any
time
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it
looks
like
the
most
obvious
source
of
law
on
this
topic.
what's
going
on
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
eighth
circuit
said
appropriate
remedies.
so,
don't
we
have
to
look
at
what
appropriate
means
in
this
context?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if...
now
that
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
issue
is
gone,
don't
we
have
to
deal
with
city
of
newport?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
say
that
we
are
precluded
from
considering
that
authority
as
we
resolve
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
so,
are
you
going
to
deal
with
it
then?
