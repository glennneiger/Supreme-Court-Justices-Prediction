well,
what
do
you
make
of
the...
the
argument
that
the
whole
touchstone
for
damages
here
is
504,
which
is
essentially
the...
the
spending
power...
the...
the...
a
statute
resting
on
the
spending
power?
the
closest
analogy
to
that
is
with
contract,
and
you
don't
get
punitive
damages
from
contract.

that
referred
to
504
for...
for...
in
effect,
for
its
remedial
scheme.
