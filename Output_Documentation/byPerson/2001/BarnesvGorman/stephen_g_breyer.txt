justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
then?
because
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
arguing
there
are
two
possibilities.
one
possibility
is
no
one
gets
punitive
damages
no
matter
who
he
sues,
and
the
second
is
that,
anyway,
a
person
who
sues
a
municipality
can't
get
punitive
damages.
your
second
argument
may
be
a
lot
stronger
than
the
first.
so,
am
i
supposed
to
go
to
the
second
argument
that
nobody
has
argued
in
the
courts
below
at
all,
bypassing
them,
or
am
i
supposed
to
go
to
the
first
argument
which
has
enormous
implications
well
beyond
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
true,
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
specifically
about
whether
to
give
an
injunction,
about
whether
you
could
give
a
trademark
remedy.
i
mean,
normally
what
the
decisions
have
been
of
the
court
under
franklin...
i'm
simply
focusing
you
on
their
main
argument.
under
franklin,
the
courts
decide
there
either
is
an
ordinary
private
right
of
action,
et
cetera,
or
there
isn't.
and
if
there
is,
you
take
it
as
it
is,
ordinarily.
and
if
there
isn't,
there's
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
should
we
divide
up,
in
other
words...
there's
this
amount
of
the
common
law
action,
but
not
that
amount.
there's...
why...
how
do
we
know
that
we
have
the
two-witness
rule
or
the...
or
the
parol
evidence
rule?
i
mean,
there
are
lots
of
controversial
things
in
common...
in
common
law
actions--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
private
people
can
bring.
so,
why
separate
out
from
that
whole
package
suddenly
punitive
damages?
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
which
one
shall
we
separate
out?
just
punitives
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
because...
why...
why
would
somebody
want
to...
title
ii
has
to
do
with
actions
against
a
government
basically,
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so,
i
thought
punitives
are
primarily
designed
to
compensate
an
individual
who's
not
going
to
be
compensated.
it's
just
a
way
of
wielding
a
very
big
club
against
the
people
who
behaved
badly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
why
would
you
want
that
big
club
to
be
wielded
against
private
people
in
limited
amounts,
but
when
you
get
to
a
government
which,
after
all,
represents
the
entire
public,
you
say
the
sky
is
the
limit?
newport
would
suggest
where
the
government
is
involved
it's
less
reasonable
to
assess
punitives
than
where
a
private
individual
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
be
sure
you...
suppose
that
we
did
look
at
the
newport
issue.
i'm
not
saying
that
we
should,
but
suppose
we
did.
and
suppose
that
you
lost
on
your
point
that
it
should
be
waived
or
deemed
waived.
what
would
your...
is
there
any
response
to
their
claim
on
the
merits
that...
that
newport
makes
clear
that
they
are
not
liable
in
punitive
damages?
