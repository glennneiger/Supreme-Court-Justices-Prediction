was
there
a
reason?
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
robbins,
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
if
this
court
says
newport
or
fact
concepts,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it...
it
says,
a
municipality
is
immune.
period.
that
takes
care
of
your
case,
and
if
the
court...
this
court
were
to
say,
eighth
circuit,
you
overlooked
the
fact
that
municipalities
are
immune
and
therefore
in...
in
this
case
you
are
wrong,
and
we
reverse,
now,
that
takes
care
of
your
client.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
should
we
in
your
case,
where
there
is
a
clear
ground,
not
decide
it
on
that
basis?
why
should
we
go
to
the
next
case
that
doesn't
involve
a
municipality?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
1983?
this
court
has
said
that
punitive
damages
are
available.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
and
you
rely
on
the
heavy
gun
in
statutes
like
title
vi,
title
ix.
that
heavy
gun
is
so
heavy
that
it's
never
used.
i
mean,
in
the
case
that
we
will
hear
tomorrow,
the
statement
was
made,
well,
yes,
it
would
be
a
drastic
sanction
to
withdraw
federal
funds,
but
in
30
years
it
hasn't
happened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
the
rehabilitation
act,
it
has
been
used
under
504?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr....
mr.
nelson,
why
don't
we
look
specifically
at
this
context,
which
is
the
ada,
and
the
anomaly
that
when
congress
thought
about
punitive
damages,
as
we
know
it
did
in
the
employment
part,
it
provided
for
them
with
qualifications
and
with
caps
on
amount.
so,
it
would
be
passing
strange,
would
it
not,
that
when
congress
is
explicit
about
punitive
damages,
it
contains
them,
and
it
when
it
says
not
one
word
one
way
or
another,
they
are
unlimited
because
that's...
as
i
take
your
argument
to
be,
under
part
3,
there
are
the
caps
and
the
qualifications,
but
under
part
2,
it's
public
service,
no
limitation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
right
that
title
iii
says
no
punitive
damages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
an
anomaly
too
because
in
title...
title
iii,
which
is
the...
the
title
that
imposes...
title
i
is
the
one...
employment.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
are
government
employers
liable
for
punitive
damages
under
title
i?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
your...
your
notion
that...
that
the
government
is
not
well
representative
in
the
legislature...
here
is
a
title
that
says,
private
sector,
you're
going
to
be
stuck.
you're
going
to
be
subject
to
punitive
damages,
but
not
government
entities.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
didn't
say
anything
about
whether
punitives
would
be
appropriate
relief
because
all
franklin
involved
was
compensatory
damages.
before
that,
it
was
thought
that
there
were
no
compensatory
damages
under
spending
statutes.
to
clarify
that,
they
used
the
phrase
appropriate
relief.
so,
we've
never
had
any
holding
that
under
franklin
punitive
damages
would
be
appropriate.
