01-682,
kay
barnes
v.
jeffrey
gorman.
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
change
the
issue,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
robbins.
mr.
garre,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
mr.
nelson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
franklin
wasn't
dealing
with
punitive
damages,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
doesn't
that
seem
rather
perverse?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
your...
your
newport
case
certainly
suggests
that
traditionally
public
entities
are
treated
differently
than
private
entities
for
the
same
conduct
if
you're
talking
about
punitive
damages.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
about
the
issue,
are
you...
are
you
suggesting
that
it
is
not
included
in
the
question
presented?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then...
then
did
you
in
your
brief
in
opposition
point
out
that
this
was
not
properly
raised
in
the
lower
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nelson,
last
year
in...
in
the
alexander
case
and
this
year
in
the
malesko
case,
we've
indicated
that
we're
taking
a
much
more
critical
look,
i
think,
at
these
kind
of
claims
than
we
ever
did
in
carlson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
what...
what
you're
arguing
basically
is
that
every
one
of
these
things
is
fixed
in
time
permanently
not
just
as
to
its
holding,
but
as...
as
to
language
in
it.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
that
that
is
not
always
necessarily
so,
that
the
court
may
take
a
slightly
different
view
some...
now
than
it
did
10
years
ago.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nelson.
mr.
robbins,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you've
already
ended.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-682
barnes
against
gorman
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
