justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
we're
jumping
probably
ahead
into
wh-
what
you're
going
to
tell
us,
but
while
we're
at
this
point,
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
it
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i-
if
you
say
that
the
s-
sentence
cannot
be
reim-
im-
imposed,
you're
saying
that
the
state
courts
are
in
the
position
of
imposing
a
sentence
th-
th-
that
is
s-
s-
s-
s-
s-
s-
s-
s-
something
of
a
ruse.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
these
are
pretrial
diversion
programs
which
have
been
very
helpful
in
the
drug
context,
but
they're
extremely
expensive
to
administer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view,
if
you
enforced
the
jail
sentence
through
the
contempt
mechanism
and
reached
the
same
result,
i
i
take
it
you
now
have
a
second
jury
trial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
but
then
the
contempt
is
is
is
is
is
really
not
substitute
of
an
equivalent
for
the
pro-
f-
f-
for
the
imposition
of
the
suspended
sentence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
do
allow
the
possibility
that
counsel
could
be
provided
in
the
event
the
probation
is
revoked.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
would
als-
it
would
also
cover,
i
take
it,
whether
or
not
the
plea
was
voluntarieen
[:
voluntary]
and
knowingly
made
originally.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
pu-
put
put
in
its
raw
form,
if
the
judge
said,
now,
if
if
you
agree
not
to
have
a
counsel,
i'll
agree
not
to
impose
a
jail
sentence,
th-
that
that
wouldn't
be
permitted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
assume
it
r-
r-
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
the
a-
a-
assuming
that
mr.
fried's
position
is
adopted
by
the
court,
what
is
the
maximum
time
that
the
alabama
trial
judge
could
sentence
the
violator
to?
what's
the
maximum
time
in
prison?
