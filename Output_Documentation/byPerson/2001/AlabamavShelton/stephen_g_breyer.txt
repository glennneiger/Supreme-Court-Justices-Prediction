justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
a
red
herring?
because
i
y-
s-
i
got
from
your
brief
the
impression
that
the
the
there's
a
practical
problem
that
that
a
lot
of
states
do
without
giving
people
lawyers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
have
any
idea
of
the
one
point
four
million
or
to
one
point
eight
million
people
who
are
on
probation
for
misdemeanors,
of
what
percentage
of
those
cases
the
the
probation
of
the
defendant
was
not
offered
a
lawyer?
i
mean,
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
isn't
it?
i
mean
i
i
don't
know
what
the
remedy
should
be
for
a
sentence
that's
not
not
an
enforceable
sentence
and
the
person
writes
it
in
the
the
judge
writes
in
the
book,
suspended
sentence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
it
be
struck
rather
than
just
li-
l-
l-
l-
l-
left
to
lie
there
unenforceable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thought
that
the
main
issue
that
we
had
here
is
the
one
we've
been
talking
about,
is
you
have
to
give
a
person
a
lawyer
when
it
is
a
petty
offense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
thought
that
that
mr.
fried's
main
point
was
don't
do
it
because
if
you
say
you
have
to
give
a
person
a
lawyer,
where
it's
a
petty
offense
and
the
only
key
thing
is
is
a
suspended
sentence,
i'll
tell
you
there
are
a
million,
eight
hundred
thousand
people
who
have
received
probation
in
petty
offenses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
you
might
know
if
that's
really
so
if
o-
or
which
seems
hard
to
get
at,
how
many
of
those
one
point
five
million
walking
around
probation
people
did
were
never
offered
a
lawyer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
petty
offense
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
has
this
court
held
that
there
congruent
right
to
a
jury
trial
and...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wrote
an
an
opinion
signing
on
to
that,
i'd
like
to
see
it...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
before...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
at
the
bottom
line
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
two
s-
phrases
in
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
it
goes
to
say,
we
tell
everybody
to
the
trial
court
vacate
that
aspect
which
imposed
the
suspended
jail
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
about
your
i
i
just
want
to
know
if
you
agree
or
you
disagree
with
their
part
which
says
we
reverse
that
aspect...
