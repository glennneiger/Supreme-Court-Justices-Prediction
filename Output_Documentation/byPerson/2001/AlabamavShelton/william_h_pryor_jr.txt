mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
thirty
years
ago
in
argersinger
versus
hamlin
and
then
more
than
twenty
years
ago
in
scott
versus
illinois,
this
court
established
the
principle
that,
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
a
state
is
not
obligated
to
provide
an
indigent
defendant
in
a
misdemeanor
case
court
appointed
and
taxpayer
funded
counsel,
provided
that
the
defendant
is
not
actually
imprisoned
upon
conviction.
eight
years
ago,
in
nichols
versus
the
united
states,
this
court
reaffirmed
that
principle.
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
distorted
this
well
established
and
workable
rule
and
held
that
a
probated
or
suspended
sentence,
which
actually
liberates
a
defendant
to
return
to
free
society,
nevertheless
triggers
a
right
to
court
appointed
and
taxpayer
funded
counsel.
there're
three
arguments
that
i
would
like
to
address...
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
this
mo-
do
you...
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
your
honor,
obviously
that
is
not
a
court
a
a
question
that
this
court
has
directly
addressed
in
either
argersinger
or
scott.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
our
reading
of
of
scott
is
that
th-
that
we
cannot
activate
the
suspended
sentence.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
yes,
ordinarily
it
would.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
right...
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
well
well,
there's
still
a
d-
a
risk
of
imprisonment,
the
same
risk
of
imprisonment,
under
our
reading
of
of
argersinger
and
scott,
that
that
is
accompanied
with
the
judgment
of
a
mere
fine.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
that
that's...
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
that
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
the
state
gains
the
powerful
tool
of
probation
to
rehabilitate
an
offender
that
the
state
believes
is
a
good
risk,
a
risk
to
return
to
free
society
who
can
be
rehabilitated,
d-
depending
on
whatever
mechanisms
of
probation
have
been
adopted
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
provide
counsel
in
more
serious
cases.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
i
i
i
think,
at
a
minimum,
the
the
probation
is
going
to
be
as
effective
as
a
judgment
of
a
fine
because
the
state
is
going
to
still
have
the
flexible
power
of
contempt,
whether
civil
or
criminal
in
nature,
to
ensure
that
its
orders
are
followed
and
and
will
continue
to
exercise
jurisdiction
of
the
probationer
during
that
period
of...
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
w-
alabama
certainly
has
the
freedom
to
adopt,
i
think,
either
system
without
running
afoul
of
the
constitution,
which
is
th-
the
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
i
know
from
the
amicus
brief
of
the
national
association
of
criminal
defense
lawyers
that
there
are
some
states
that
impose,
in
fact,
pretrial
probation,
that
that
is
something
that...
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
i
i
just
don't
know.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
the
states
certainly
view
that
as
an
effective
mechanism...
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
i
think
that
the
that
the
alabama
legislature
has
the
inherent
power
to
define
what
a
sentence
is,
whether
a
sentence
is
a
fine,
or
whether
a
sentence
is
imprisonment.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
if
alabama
wanted
it.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
that's
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
then
it
proceeds...
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
believe
the
the
b-
the
brief
listed
twenty-three
states.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
because
at
least
in
the
in
the
in
the
case
of
the
ordinary
plea
bargain,
the
defendant
comes
forward
and
admits
the
wrongdoing.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
alabama
doesn't
have
it
in
this
context
except
with
respect
to
drug
offenders.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
w-
justice
ginsburg,
i'd
say
no
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
well,
i
i
guess
it
would
be
dependent
in
part
on
the
nature
of
the
contempt
proceeding.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
that's
absolutely
right,
although
i
i
would
argue
that
that
the
threat
of
imprisonmenent
[:
imprisonment]
is
still
enough
to
give
the
probationer
an
incentive
to
follow
the
orders
of
the
court.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief...
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
the
suspended
sentence
was
thirty
days...
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
that's
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
right.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
we're
we're
trying
to
make
sense,
as
we
understand
it,
of
of
the
application
of
the
rule
of
actual
imprisonment.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
no
no,
justice
breyer,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
were
were...
mr.
william
h.
pryor,
jr.
no,
i
don't.
