mr.
steven
b.
duke
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
were
this
a
petty
offense
prosecution,
perhaps
the
only
legitimate,
appropriate
question
would
be
the
one
that
has
occupied
the
court
thus
far
this
morning,
but
this
is
not
a
petty
offense
prosecution.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
because
argersinger,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
a
petty
offense
case.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
it
it
was
not
the
the
rationale,
but
it
w-
it
does
support
the
result
of
the
alabama
supreme...
mr.
steven
b.
duke
the
the
the
studies
that
i've
seen
suggest
that
in
misdemeanor
petty
misdemeanor
cases,
re-
frequently
the
the
people
are
offered
a
lawyer
in
a
in
a
in
a
group
and
s-
it's
suggested
that
most
of
them
don't
need
lawyers
because
they're
not
going
to
jail.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
because
the
authorized
sentence
in
this
case
was
one
year,
which
made
the
jury
trial
right
guaranteed
him
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
under
the
sixth
amendment,
and
s-
because
this
was
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
i
i
submit
it
does,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
as
i
suggested,
argersinger
de-
dealt
with
a
petty
offense.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
the
scott
opinion,
which
you
wrote,
did
not
actually
address
the
serious
offense
six
month
distinction
because
the
parties
were
not
addressing
it.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
all...
mr.
steven
b.
duke
criminal
offenses
but...
mr.
steven
b.
duke
pardon?
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i
i
don't
think
i
have
to
argue
that,
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i'm
saying
that
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
exists
because
and
only
because
it's
a
criminal
prosecution
in
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i'm
not
arguing
that
all
petty
offenses
are
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
otherwise
there
would
be
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
no.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
nor
has
it...
mr.
steven
b.
duke
nor
has
it
held
otherwise.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
then
i
urge
the
court
to
at
least
reserve
the
issue
of
what
is
the
appropriate
right
to
counsel
in
a
serious
offense
where,
as
in
this
case,
the
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
jury
trial.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
argersinger
dealt
with
a
stop-gap
issue
about
where
there's
no
right
to
a
jury
trial,
can
we
n-
deny
counsel,
and
argersinger
said
no,
not
if
you
send
the
m-
person
to
prison
because
that's
the
basic
due
process
proposition.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes,
but
the
crucial
difference
is
that
the
defendant
under
this
proceeding
that
mr.
fried
is
is
urging
the
court
to
approve
the
defendant
would
be
sent
to
jail
without
his
guilt
ever
being
determined
in
a
criminal
trial
in
which
he
was
repretented
[:
represented]
by
counsel.
