we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
oh

twelve
fourteen,
alabama
versus
lereed
shelton.
general
pryor.
[inaudible]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
your
point
of
view,
general
pryor,
what
does
the
state
gain
by,
as
as
opposed
to
what
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said,
by
following
following
your
your
line
of
reasoning?
as
i
think
as
justice
kennedy
said,
it
it
it
imposes
a
sentence,
but
a
sentence
that
everybody
knows
can't
be
enforced.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wh-
what
w-
ho-
how
effective
is
probation
going
to
be
if
there
isn't
the
threat
of
of
a
of
a
sentence
in
case
of
probation
violation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
state
which
imposes
probation
without
a
suspended
sentence
that
you
know
of?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
post-trial,
after
a
conviction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
she-
shelton
was
not
given
any
pretrial
diversion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
pryor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
pretty
speculative,
isn't
it?
since
that
question
doesn't
confront
us
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fried,
and
thank
you
for
your
participation
as
an
amicus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
that
neither
of
those
cases
squarely
control
the
outcome
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
holding
does
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
true
also
isn't
it
true
also,
at
least
according
to
some
of
the
statistics
quoted
in
the
that
frequently
these
cases
are
not
prosecuted
by
lawyers?
they're
simply
plo-
prosecuted
by
the
arresting
officer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
the
jail
sentence
would
not
be
for
the
original
crime
necessarily
but
perhaps
just
for
breaking
probation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
tha-
tha-
tha-
that's
what
i
mean.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mills.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
you're
not
saying
it
would
guarantee
counsel
if
if
only
a
fine
were
imposed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
argens-
argersinger?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
but
this
wasn't
the
basis
on
y-
the
basis
you're
sus-
s-
su-
submitting
now
wasn't
the
basis
on
which
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
ruled,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
the
question
presented
is
this.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
r-
r-
reached
different
results
on
the
on
those
two
issues.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
duke.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
pryor.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
number
00-1214,
alabama
against
shelton
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
