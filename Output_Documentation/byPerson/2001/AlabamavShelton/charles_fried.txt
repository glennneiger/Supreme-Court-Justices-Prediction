mr.
charles
fried
[ns]
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
fried
it
do-
it
does
work.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
that's
a
very
real
possibility.
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
fried
that
could
be
brought
up.
mr.
charles
fried
alabama
is
a
good
example
of
what
is
open
at
probation.
mr.
charles
fried
i
don't
see
why
in
those...
mr.
charles
fried
could
not
argue,
look,
you're
asking
whether
this
will
depreciate
the
gravity
of
the
original
offense.
mr.
charles
fried
no
question.
mr.
charles
fried
we
try
to
infer
that
in
the
brief.
