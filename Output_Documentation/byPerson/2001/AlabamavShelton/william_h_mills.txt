mr.
william
h.
mills
[ns]
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
william
h.
mills
i-
i-
it
would
be
my
position
that
argersinger
does
by
the
some
of
the
pronouncements
that
it
makes.
mr.
william
h.
mills
the
holding
does
not
certainly.
mr.
william
h.
mills
well,
that
that
puzzled
me
somewhat
when
the
state
made
that
concession
in
its
reply
brief
that
this
was
in
e-
in
effect
a
sham
sentence.
mr.
william
h.
mills
perhaps
we're
we're
dealing
with
a
sham
sentence.
mr.
william
h.
mills
that's
the
attorney
general's...
mr.
william
h.
mills
what
the
alabama
appellate
court
and
supreme
court
did
was
merely
strike
the
the
sentence.
mr.
william
h.
mills
well,
i
believe
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
it
was
it
was
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
william
h.
mills
i'm
not
not
sure
they
articulated
it
in
those
terms,
but
their
their
basis
for
reaching
the
decision
they
reached
was
the
the
federal
cases
that
deal
with
the
right
of
counsel.
mr.
william
h.
mills
perhaps
it
was
inadvertence,
but
the
the
alabama
rules
of
criminal
procedure
ha-
have
that
a-
as
a
part
of
the
th-
the
processing
of
an-
any
case.
mr.
william
h.
mills
prosecution,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
mills
n-
no-
not
in
those
terms.
mr.
william
h.
mills
say
where
constitutionally
required.
mr.
william
h.
mills
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
mills
from
the
th-
the
wording
of
the
alabama
rules
of
criminal
procedure
about
appointment
of
counsel
at
the
present
time,
i
i
would
assume
that
the
trial
judge
must
go
through
the
process
outlined
in
argersinger,
that
is,
make
the
pretrial
determination
of
whether
imprisonment
is
a
likely
punishment
in
this
particular
case,
and
if
if
so,
appoint
counsel.
mr.
william
h.
mills
that
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
mills
presumably
that's
th-
the
process
that's
being
followed.
mr.
william
h.
mills
i
don't
have
any
data
that
would
would
support
that,
but
it
but
it
would
seem
that
if
the
trial
judge
makes
the
pretrial
determination
that
any
sentence,
wheth-
whether
immediate
or
suspended,
is
warranted
or
maybe
warranted
in
this
particular
case,
that
that
counsel
should
be...
mr.
william
h.
mills
that's
the
position.
mr.
william
h.
mills
that
perhaps
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
mills
that
happens
occasionally
in
in
alabama.
mr.
william
h.
mills
[ns]
if
if
kn-
knowingly
waived,
i
i
don't
see
a
a
constitutional
problem
with
that.
mr.
william
h.
mills
i-
it
it
is.
mr.
william
h.
mills
it
it
is
done.
mr.
william
h.
mills
and,
of
of
course,
this
is
th-
this
is
the
distinction
between
the
the
pretrial
diversion
mechanism
that
was
addressed
earlier
an-
and
a
trial.
mr.
william
h.
mills
yes,
sir,
and
and
it
seems
if...
mr.
william
h.
mills
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
mills
well,
i
i
couldn't
speak
to
all
jurisdictions,
but
certainly
un-
under
alabama
law,
there
would
be
no
n-
no
way
to
impose
a
sentence
for
breaking
probation.
mr.
william
h.
mills
this,
course,
is
correct
in
that
this
th-
this
is
the
the
carrot
and
and
and
stick
analogy
which
which...
mr.
william
h.
mills
i
think
that's
what
he
he
said.
mr.
william
h.
mills
that
that
is
that
is
for
the
contempt
it-
itself.
mr.
william
h.
mills
i
think
this
court
has
addressed
that
issue
that
it
constitutionally
can,
and
i
i
assume
there's
no
no
impediment
to
that
under
alabama
law.
mr.
william
h.
mills
well,
i
think
th-
the
th-
th-
the
difference
is
if
if
the
suspended
sentence
is
imposed,
a
person
is
being
convic-
imprisoned
because
he
committed
a
crime.
mr.
william
h.
mills
well,
th-
this
is
true,
but
only
if
he
willfully
refuses
to
pay
it
wh-
where
he
has
the
ability
to
do
so.
mr.
william
h.
mills
well,
i
believe
willfulness
willfully
refusing
to
pay
the
fine
would
be
a
a
precondition
to
to
a
contempt
sentence.
mr.
william
h.
mills
that
that's...
mr.
william
h.
mills
well,
the
the
the
fine
and
the
the
w-
contempt
for
w-
willfully
refusing
to
comply
with
some
other
condition,
i
i
i
could
not
distinguish
those.
mr.
william
h.
mills
of
course,
l-
let
let
me
add
one
other
thing
about
the
contempt
process
to
to
enforce,
u-
under
alabama
law,
wouldn't
save
the
state
any
money.
mr.
william
h.
mills
well,
i
w-
i
would
say
one
th-
per-
perhaps
the
the
number
of
cases
would
not
be
as
large
as
as
might
be
anticipated.
