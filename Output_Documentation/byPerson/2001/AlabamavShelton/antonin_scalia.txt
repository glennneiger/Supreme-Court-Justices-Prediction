would
the
state
have
to
to
put
somebody
on
probation
un-
unless
unless
it
is
the
suspension
of
of
a
judgment
of
incarceration?
i
mean,
can
a
state
just
go
around
saying
you're
going
to
be
on
probation?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
me
the
only
the
only
reason
it
it
it
has
that
grip
over
the
person
is
that
th-
is
that
th-
it
has
a
right
to
incarcerate
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
there's
an
alternative
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
but
it
would
only
it
would
only
undergo
that
expense
where
there
has
been
a
breach
of
the
conditions
of
of
probation.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
do
you
get
that
from,
that
you're
appealing
to
the
text
of
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
misdemeanors
criminal...
justice
antonin
scalia
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
does
the
constitution
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
criminal
prosecutions.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
if
you're
appealing
to
the
constitution,
you
er
and
and
and
and
you
say
it's
clear
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
rely
on
the
text
of
the
constitution,
which
is
what
i
thought
you
were
doing.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
it's
a
criminal
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
constitution
that
says
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
it'd
include
petty
misdemeanors
as
well
as
what
you
call
major
misdemeanors.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
you're
arguing
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
the-
they
the-
they
are
not
criminal...
