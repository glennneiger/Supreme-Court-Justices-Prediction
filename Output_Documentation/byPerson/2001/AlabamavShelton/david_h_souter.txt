justice
david
h.
souter
you're
you're
treating
the
contempt
proceeding,
in
effect,
as
a
separate
proceeding
then,
and
i
take
it,
though
i'm
not
sure
that
i
remember
this
from
your
briefs,
i
take
it
that
on
on
your
view
of
the
way
the
scheme
ought
to
operate
in
the
contempt
proceeding,
before
there
could
be
any
confinement
on
a
finding
of
contempt,
that
counsel
would
have
to
be
provided
then
if
if
the
individual
is
indigent
and
didn't
waive
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
counseled
proceeding
that
distinguishes
your
case
from
from
the
case
that
mr.
fried
argues
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
the
case
in
alabama
that
probation
cannot
be
imposed
without
a
suspended
sentence?
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
we
have
at
least
a
more
candid
system
or
wouldn't
the
interaction
of
of
argersinger
and
and
the
alabama
system,
as
you
view
argersinger,
produce
a
more
candid
system
if
if
we
took
the
position
that,
no,
they
can't
impose
a
suspended
sentence,
and
alabama
would
then
presumably
amend
its
laws
so
that
probation
could
be
imposed
without
imposing
a
suspended
sentence,
and
you,
on
your
view,
would
have
your
your
contempt
remedy.
justice
david
h.
souter
take
it
what
they
would
do
on
that
scheme
would
be
to
say,
upon
conviction
of
offense
a,
the
court
may
impose
probation,
and
if
the
conditions
of
probation
are
violated
and
are
shown
in
a
separate
trial
or
proceeding
to
that
effect,
the
violation
itself
can
be
punished.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
if
alabama
wanted
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
one
of
the
things
that
didn't
happen,
we
know
for
sure,
in
this
case
was
that
th-
the-
a-
an
an
offer
of
counsel.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
in
any
misdemeanor?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
they're
not
pr-
providing
counsel
in
these
cases
now
because,
i
take
it,
the
state's
position
is
it's
not
constitutionally
required.
justice
david
h.
souter
at
what
point
do
they
regard
it
as
being
constitutionally
required?
when
the
sentence
can
exceed
six
months
or
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
getting
at
is
i
want
to
know
i
want
your
response
to
the
argument
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
a
great
practical
difference
if
we
say,
no,
you
may
not
impose
sentences
like
this
at
all,
even
though
they're
merely
suspended.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
any
imprisonment?
one
day
of
imprisonment?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
is
not
doing
something
eccentric
in
this
respect.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
the
only
difference
then
between
the
cases
in
which
c-
misdemeanor
cases,
for
example,
in
which
counsel
is
offered,
if
an
individual
is
indigent,
and
counsel
is
not
offered
are
cases
in
which
the
judge
says
in
advance
i'm
not
going
to
put
this
guy
away
at
all
even
if
we
convict
him.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
do
you
have
do
you
have
any
basis
to
tell
us
what
practical
difference
it
would
make
if
the
judge
m-
said,
well,
i
may
impose
a
suspended
sentence
and
therefore
i
will
have
to
offer
counsel
because
i
read
argersinger
as
requiring
that?
do
you
know
what
difference
that
would
make
in
practical
terms?
how
many
cases
would
counsel
have
to
be
offered
and
pro-
and
potentially
provided
for
where
it's
not
being
offered
and
potentially
provided
for
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
your
position
in
the
case
of
the
individual
who
refuses
to
pay
the
fine?
no
suspended
sentence
of
incarceration,
simply
a
sentence
of
a
fine,
and
he
refuses
to
pay
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
does
is
there
is
is
there
some
tension
between
the
position
you
take
about
the
inability
of
the
state
to
enforce
a
a
condition
of
sentence
or
a
condition
of
suspension
and
the
position
that
you
take
or
acknowledge
about
the
ability
to
enforce
the
the
sentence
of
fine?
why
should
the
two
cases
be
different?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
fine
is
imposed,
the
fine
is
being
imposed
because
the
individual
committed
a
crime.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
is
the
difference
that
you're
making
willful?
that
that
violations
of
the
conditions
of
suspension
are
not
willful
and
refusals
to
pay
fine
are
willful?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
just
as
that
the
the
willfulness
factor
is
the
same
in
the
refusal
to
abide
by
that
condition
as
it
is
in
the
refusal
to
pay
the
fine.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
doesn't
follow
that
he
could
be
sent
to
jail
without
providing
him
a
lawyer
in
the
subsequent
proceeding.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
in
nichols,
after
all,
we
had
another
conviction,
and
we
had
a
lawyer
representing
the
individual
when
the
question
came
up
whether
the
first
conviction
should
be
considered
and
so
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
be
a
subsequent
proceeding,
and
there
would
at
least
this
is
not
the
position
he's
arguing
for
this
morning,
but
it
would
be
consistent
with
his
position
that
counsel
be
provided
in
that
subsequent
proceeding.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
were
motor
vehicle
cases...
justice
david
h.
souter
motor
vehicle
cases
take
you
out
of
this
problem,
i
assume,
in
fine
situations
because
if
the
fine
isn't
paid,
the
motor
vehicle
i
mean,
the
the
the
the
the
motor
vehicle
laws
simply
provide
a
a
a
purely
civil
administrative
means
of
of
remedying
the
problem.
