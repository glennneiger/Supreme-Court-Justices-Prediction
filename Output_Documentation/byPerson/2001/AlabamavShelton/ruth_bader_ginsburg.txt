justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
pryor,
i
can
understand
a
line
between
a
fine
and
any
kind
of
confinement,
and
probation
may
involve
no
immediate
incarceration,
but
it
does
involve
what
could
be
very
significant
restraints
on
a
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
what...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mills,
there
is
one
thing
that
i
think
is
a
piece
of
information
that
that
is
in
the
record,
and
that
is
that
most
non-indigent
misdeme-
misdemeanors
appear
in
court
without
counsel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
jury
trial
line
is
six
months'
imprisonment,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
here,
under
argersinger,
it
could
be
one
day.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
an
indigent
misdemeanor
defendant
to
the
assistants
of
court
appointed
counsel.
defendant-respondent,
lereed
shelton
was
convicted
in
an
alabama
court
of
third-degree
assault
after
a
jury
trial
at
which
he
appeared
without
counsel.
the
trial
judge
sentenced
shelton
to
monetary
penalties
plus
a
suspended
30-day
jail
term
to
be
activated
if
shelton
violated
the
terms
of
a
two-year
probationary
period.
on
appeal,
the
alabama
supreme
court
affirmed
the
conviction
and
the
monetary
penalties
but
invalidated
the
suspended
jail
sentence.
jail
time
even
if
suspended
may
not
be
imposed
on
a
defendant
too
poor
to
hire
a
lawyer
the
alabama
supreme
court
held
unless
they
paid
counsel
is
engaged
to
represent
him
in
the
prosecution
for
the
crime
charged.
we
affirm
that
judgment.
three
positions
are
before
us;
first,
shelton
asked
us
simply
to
uphold
the
alabama
supreme
court’s
judgment
and
that
is
what
today’s
decision
does;
second,
the
state
of
alabama
now
agrees
with
shelton
that
the
sixth
amendment
which
guarantees
the
right
to
counsel
precludes
the
activation
of
suspended
sentence
to
jail
a
defendant
uncounseled
to
trial,
but
the
state
maintained
it
is
compatible
with
the
constitution
merely
to
impose
a
jail
term,
one
that
will
never
be
executed
as
a
hook
on
which
to
pay
probationary
punishment.
that
novel
position
was
not
urged
in
shelton’s
case
until
alabama
filed
it
to
reply
brief
in
this
court.
we
are
a
court
of
review,
not
a
first
view
and
therefore,
do
not
pass
an
alabama’s
totally
asserted
position.
we
appointed
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
to
argue
as
a
friend
of
a
court,
a
third
position
that
failure
to
appoint
council
to
an
indigent
defendant
does
not
bar
the
imposition
of
a
suspended
sentence
upon
conviction
of
a
misdemeanor,
even
though
the
defendant
might
be
incarcerated
in
the
event
probation
is
revoked.
we
now
reject
that
third
position
concluding
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
our
pathmarking
1972
decision
argersinger
v.
hamlin,
which
held
that
defense
counsel
must
be
appointed
in
any
criminal
prosecution
whether
classified
as
petty,
misdemeanor
or
felony
that
actually
leads
to
imprisonment
even
for
a
brief
period.
when
a
suspended
sentence
is
activated
by
a
probation
violation,
the
defendant
is
jailed
not
for
the
probation
violation
but
for
the
underlying
offense.
the
uncounseled
conviction
at
that
point
results
in
imprisonment
and
that,
our
opinion,
explains
is
just
what
the
sixth
amendment
forbids.
the
friend
of
the
court
argument
we
invited
suggests
that
it
is
fair
and
economical
to
allow
imposition
of
a
suspended
sentence
on
an
uncounseled
defendant
and
deal
with
the
right
to
counsel
if
it
all
only
later
when
a
defendant
initially
allowed
to
remain
at
liberty
faces
revocation
of
his
probation.
we
resist
the
front
end
segmentation
proposed
and
decline
to
speculate
on
what
kind
of
a
hearing
alabama
might
sometime
hence
created
for
the
backend
probation
revocation
situation.
looking
to
the
here
and
now,
the
character
of
the
probation
revocation
hearing
currently
afforded
in
alabama
is
not
in
doubt.
it
is
an
informal
affair
at
which
the
defendant
has
neither
a
right
to
counsel
nor
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
validity
or
reliability
of
the
original
conviction.
a
hearing
is
so
timed
and
structured
cannot
compensate
for
the
absence
of
trial
counsel.
our
decision,
it
is
strenuously
argued,
will
impose
a
heavy
toll
on
state
criminal
justice
systems.
most
states,
however,
under
their
own
constitutions
or
laws
provide
a
right
to
counsel
more
generous
that
the
federal
constitution
affords.
the
cost
and
impact
of
today’s
judgment
is
therefore
likely
to
be
more
modest
and
projected.
we
note
too
that
a
pretrial
probation
system
employed
in
many
states
allows
a
supervised
cuase
of
rehabilitation
without
diminishing
the
constitutional
imperative
that
no
person
may
be
imprisoned
for
an
offense
unless
he
was
represented
by
counsel
at
his
trial.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
kennedy,
and
justice
thomas
join.
