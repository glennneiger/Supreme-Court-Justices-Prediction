justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
concede
that
the
state
can
never
impose
the
original
sentence
of
time
in
jail?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
asking
whether
the
state
of
alabama
concedes
that
it
can't
ever
impose
that
original
sentence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
happens
in
alabama
if
if
a
a
criminal
defendant
is
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
and
placed
on
probation
and
then
violates
probation?
does
that
enable
the
state
to
impose
the
original
sentence
for
violation
of
the
probation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
pryor,
explain
to
me
how
some
other
states
approach
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
deferred
prosecution
on
condition
that
the
the
defendant
abide
by
certain
terms
and
conditions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
if
the
defendant
then
doesn't
live
up
to
it,
then
it
proceeds
to
trial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
states
use
a
system
like...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
any
more
unseemly
than
the
ordinary
plea
bargain?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
court
basically
said,
fine
only?
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
case,
what
do
we
think
about
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
would
be
constitutional
for
the
state
to
offer
i-
the
defendant
at
the
outset
the
promise
of
imposition
of
a
suspended
sentence
if
counsel
were
waived?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
done
sometimes
in
alabama?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mhm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
misunderstood
general
pryor's
argument,
but
i
thought
he
was
here
arguing
no,
he
wouldn't
impose
the
original
sentence
ever.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
involve
imposition
of
the
original
sentence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
i
understood
as...
