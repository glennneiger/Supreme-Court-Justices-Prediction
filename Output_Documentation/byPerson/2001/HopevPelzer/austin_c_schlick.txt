mr.
austin
c.
schlick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
official
is
immune
from
personal
liability
for
violating
federal
rights
unless
it
the
violation
would
have
been
clear
to
a
reasonable
officer.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
the
the
overarching
standard
would
be
the
harlow
versus
fitzgerald,
where
the
law
was
clearly
established.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
i-
this
in
in
that,
in
the
particular
context
where
one
looks
to
case
law,
this
court's
decision
in
saucier
versus
katz
uses
the
formulation
whether
the
facts
were
distinguishable
in
a
fair
way,
and
that
would
be
an
appropriate
gloss
as
well.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
even
under
that
approach,
the
first
step
would
be
to
ask
whether
this
court's
decisions
themselves
gave
clear
notice,
and
the
answer
to
that
in
our
view
would
be
no.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes,
it
it
could
be.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
justice
kennedy,
let
me
address
the
eleventh
circuit
first.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
your
honor,
we
don't
suggest
a
view
one
way
or
the
other
on
liability.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
i
i
i
i
think
that
suggests
justice
kennedy's
second
question,
which
was,
absent
gates,
how
would
the
case
be
viewed,
and
i-
in
that
situation...
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
no.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
respondants
have
briefed
the
case
as
if
they
were
acting
in
compliance
with
regulation
four
twenty-nine
which
is
is
not
our
in
in
our
view
how
the
case
must
be
taken.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
correct.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
to
answer
justice
st-
kennedy's
second
question,
how
would
this
court
address
the
issue
if
gates
versus
collier
did
not
exist,
in
that
case,
a
reasonable
officer
the
question
would
be,
what
would
a
reasonable
off-
what
would've
been
clear
to
a
reasonable
officer.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
this...
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
[inaudible]
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes,
we
think
it
would
be
sufficient
to
estab-
to
establish
a
a
substantive
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment,
although
as
the
facts
must
be
taken
here,
qualified
immunity
would
attach,
because
there's
a
colorable
argument
that
the
threshold
was
not
crossed,
but
i
i
i
want
to
say
that
this
court
has
not
resolved
whether
it's
this
deliberate
indifference
standard
or
rather
the
hudson
versus
mcmillian
test,
the
excessive
force
test
of
whether
force
was
used
maliciously
and
sadistically
to
inflict
harm,
and
that
is
an
unresolved
question,
is,
it's
that
is
that
very
absence
o-
of
certainty
that
that
would
be
most
relevant
absent
the
gates
versus
collier
decision.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
not
in
not
in
all
cases,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
the
relevant
considerations,
justice
scalia,
would
be
the
degree
of
pain
and
and
the
threat
to
the
safety
of...
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
the
the
overarching
question
of
whether
the
pain
was
wanton
and
unnecessary
would
focus
on
the
degree
of
pain,
the
penological
justification,
and
the
threat
to
the
inmate's
safety.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
no,
your
honor.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
it's
petitioner's
position,
but
not
the
position
of
the
united
states.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
