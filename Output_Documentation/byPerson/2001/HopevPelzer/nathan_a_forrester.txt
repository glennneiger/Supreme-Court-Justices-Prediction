mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
[ns]
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
no,
justice
souter,
they
didn't
pointedly
cite
gates.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
they
they
refer
to
the
subsequent
authority
in
williams
v
burton
and
ort
v
white,
and
i
don't
think
that
we
can
presume
that
they
saw
gates
and
ignored
it,
or
that
they
sl-
just
thought
that
case
really
had
been
largely
superseded
by
this
subsequent
clarifying
authority.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
well,
the
proposition
for
which
the
petitioner's
amici
wish
this
court
to
read
gates
and
say
that
our
respondents
should
have
read
gates
is
this
very
broad
proposition
that
any
form
of
restraint
f-
as
a
as
a
form
of
punishment
is
unconstitutional,
although
that
proposition
has
clearly
been
narrowed
not
just
by
the
eleventh
circuit's
rulings
in
williams
v
burton
and
ort,
which
indicated
that
certainly
in
an
excessive
force
context
you
could
restrain
a
prisoner
for
a
period
of
time,
but
also
by
this
court's
rulings
in
wilson
v
seiter
and
whitley
v
albers,
and
the
clarifying
ruling
in
farmer
v
brennan,
where
this
court
indicated
that
the
fact
that
a
restraint
was
po-
possibly
objectively
problematic
is
not
enough
to
create
an
eighth
amendment
right.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
well...
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
i
have
a
a
a
couple
responses
to
that.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
well,
f-
first
of
all
we
think
that
the
the
court's
entitled
to
dat-
t-
to
take
judicial
notice
of
it,
because
it
is
the
law
that
you
don't
have
to
act-
actually
introduce
the
law
into
the
record,
but
on
top
of
that,
it
was
always
in
the
mix.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
well,
because,
for
[:
your]
honor,
the
the
the
the
most
important
fact
there
is
that
he
could
have
gotten
off
the...
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
no,
your
honor,
we
didn't
we
didn't
say
that,
but
it...
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
petitioner's
burden,
as
the
plaintiff,
to
set
forth
the
facts
that...
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
th-
the
activity
log
that
is
in
the
record
is...
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
first
incident.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
yes,
your
honor,
it...
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
it
refers
to
the
two
conditions
that
are
the
conditions
for
using
the
restraining
bar
under
reg
four
twenty-nine.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
to
work
and
being
disruptive
to
the
work
squad.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
that
refers
that's
actually
four
twenty-nine,
and
that
is...
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
well,
reg
four
twenty-nine
is
is
is
what
these
respondents
were
following
when
they
put
him
on
the...
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
has
not
alleged
that
when
he
was
put
on
the
bar
he
could
not
have
gotten
off.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
and
he's
slumping.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
yes.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
i
thin-
your
honor,
and
i-
to
to
be
in
twenty-eight
years
since
gates
v
collier,
no
federal
court
of
which
we
are
aware
has
ever
read
it
for
the
broad
principle
that
petitioner
now
seeks
to
to
read
it
in
this
case.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
well,
your
honor,
it's
it's
not
clear
that
they
didn't
write
it
up.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
yes.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
[inaudible]
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
yes.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
no,
no,
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
no,
your
honor,
not
hanging
from
the
rail.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
chest
high
like
this...
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
can
stand
fully...
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
no,
no
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
no,
your
honor,
he
did
not
allege,
ever,
nor
present
evidence
that
he
was
denied
a
bathroom
break.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
if
it
is
being
done
because
he
has
refused
to
work
and
i
would
hasten
to
add,
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
yes,
your
honor,
it
it
is
certainly
punishment
in
the
broad
sense.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
petitioner
never
alleged...
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
the
petitioner
petitioner
bears
the
burden,
as
the
plaintiff,
to
say
i
could
not
have
gotten
off
the
bar
if
i
had
asked...
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
well,
it
is
a
regrettable...
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
well,
i
would
hasten
to
add,
your
honor,
that
tho-
those
allegations
that
you
keep
reading
again
are
not
alleged
against
our
three...
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
we-
i-
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
do
believe
it
was
the
plaintiff's
burden,
your
hon-
y-
d-
justice
breyer.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
you-
a-
b-
we
d-
we
d-
we
do
think
it's
punishment
in
a
broad
sense.
mr.
nathan
a.
forrester
yes,
your
honor,
but
by
bu-
but
getting
into
the
altercation,
actually
getting
to
the
point
where
he
had
his
blade
raised
and
was
ready
to
strike
another
inmate,
is
d-
certainly
disruptive
to
the
work
squad.
