to
assume
that
the
facts
as
alleged
are
true
for
purposes
of
deciding
whether
summary
judgment
is
appropriate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i-
i
i
gather
we
just
assume
those
are
c-
correct
for
purposes
of
evaluating
the
summary
judgment
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
eleventh
circuit
decided
there
was
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
was
no
cross-appeal
on
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
do
we
take
that
as
a
given,
too?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
[inaudible]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thirty-eight
and...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
your
position,
i
take
it,
that
so
long
as
the
regulation
was
in
place
so
that
he
could
go
back
to
work,
that
the
state
could
legitimately
keep
him...
justice
sandra

o'connor
hanging
to
this
rail
for
as
long
as
it
takes,
no
matter
how
hot
it
is,
and
without
water,
for
as
long
as
the
state
chooses
to
do
it,
just
so
long
as
the
regulation
is
there
that
says,
he
can
go
back
to
work?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
handcuffed
to
the
rail...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
long
as
the
state
wishes
without
administration
of
water
or
bathroom
breaks,
just
because
there's
a
regulation
that
says
he
can
go
back
to
work.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
he
was
not
given
water
and
not
given
bathroom
breaks.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
that
i-
certainly
in
the
hot
sun
for
three
hours
without
water
is
fine.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
not
split-second.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ask
whether
a
reasonable
officer
in
these
circumstances
would've
known
that
what
was
done
was
unconstitutional.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
court
do
you
rely
on
as
changing
what
gates
said?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
that
were
a
requirement,
e-
you
think
the
allegations
here
don't
suffice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
one
would
not
a
reasonable
person
would
not
be
aware
that
you
couldn't
restrain
someone
on
a
post
or
rail
for
seven
hours
in
the
heat,
without
water
more
than
every
three
hours?
