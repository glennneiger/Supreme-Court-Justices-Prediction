justice
stephen
g.

what
are
we
supposed
to
take
as
the
facts?
do
we
take
the
facts
in
the
second
affidavit
of
larry
hope?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
bathroom
breaks
in
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
got
to
do
with
it,
that
reg?
i
mean,
so
what?
that
is,
his
allegation
is
that
he
was
left
for
seven
hours
on
a
very
hot
day
with
his
arms
about
over
his
head,
standing
up,
and
given
no
water,
except
once,
so
the-
three
hours
at
least
without
any
water.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
he
said
that
was
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
regulation?
did
you
move,
did
you
say
did
you
say
i
don't
see
in
these
papers
in
front
of
me,
say
that
the
reason
we're
entitled
to
summary
judgment
is,
it
was
ordinary
practice
to
let
the
person
off
and
then
you'd
cite
that,
and
here
they're
following
ordinary
practice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
set
forth
facts,
and
the
question
is,
why
doesn't
that
per-
th-
these
i
gave
you
the
facts,
and
why
doesn't
that
present
i
would
have
thought
a
as
a
trial
judge
you'd
say,
of
course
that's
an
issue
for
trial,
unless,
of
course,
there's
something
unusual
here,
something
unusual
that
maybe
w-
well
all
right
and
you're
saying
wh-
where
where
is
this
counter
thing
in
the
in
the
in
the
in
the
trial
court?
i
i
don't
see
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right
what
page
should
i
look
at?
i'll
look
at
whatever
you
tell
me
to
look
at
in
the
trial
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
it
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wh-
wh-
why
don't
you
read
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
it
says
is,
refusing
to
work,
fight.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
put
him
on
the
bar.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right
after
it
says,
restraining
bar
to
be
used
only
during
daylight
hours,
annex
a
to
a
r
one
nineteen,
so
now,
what
has
that
to
do
with
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
you're
a
genius
as
a
trial
judge,
and
you
happen
to
know
that
when
it
says
here
a
r
one
nineteen
it
means
a
r
four
two
nine,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
w-
whether
or
not
it
is
the
case
that
any
human
being
would
know
that
it
is
cruel
and
unusual
to
keep
a
person,
if
that's
what
happened
it's
what
he's
alleged
keep
a
person
chained
with
his
arms
over
his
head,
handcuffed
to
a
bar,
for
seven
hours,
in
the
hot
sun,
give
not
giving
him
water
but
for
once,
so
he
goes
at
least
three
hours
without
water.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
my
pictures
happens
to
show
it's
slightly
up
here,
his
hands,
and
the
others
show
it's
about
eye
level.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
why
doesn't
the
why
doesn't
the
ort,
which
you
say
he's
s-
s-
the
magistrate
on
eigh-
page
eighty-nine
and
ninety,
supports
your
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
what
you
say,
but
what
the
allegation
says
is
that
it
was
your
three
respondents.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
read
was
the
plaintiff's
affidavit
saying
they
were
responsible
in
his
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
ask
you
a...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
he's
right
about
my
my
thing
about
the
defendants
was
not
june
seventh,
it
was,
the
he
alleges
it.
