and
what
what
should
be
the
rule
th-
that
was
that
you
say
was
violated
here?
wh-
if
we
write
out
the
opinion,
we
say
the
rule
that
the
officer
should
have
known
is,
then
we
have
to
fill
in
the
blank.
what
what
is
that
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
d-
does
restraint
include
solitary
confinement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
gets
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
and
i'm
wondering
again
if
the
court
writes
the
opinion
giving
you
the
judgment
that
you
seek,
isn't
it
necessary
for
us
to
say,
a
this
law
was
clearly
established,
and
b
it
is
a
correct
interpretation,
a
a
correct
exposition
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause,
so
we
are
it
would
be
a
rather
odd
holding
for
us
to
say,
well,
this
was
established
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
but
we're
not
telling
you
whether
or
not
that
was
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
standard
that
the
officers
should
have
been
aware
of,
first
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
then,
assuming
that
we
think
we
that
this
case
presents
either
the
necessity
or
the
proper
opportunity
for
us
to
say
what
the
national
standard
ought
to
be,
what
is
the
standard
at
a
more
specific
level
of
abstraction
than
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
that
we
should
be
dealing
with?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
purposes
of
punishment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
deliberately
indifferent
is
a
sufficient
standard
for
the
imposition
of
liability...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
without
more
specificity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
officers
must
be
a-
a-
aware
that
their
specific
acts
can
be
challenged
under
the
general
standard
of
deliberately
indifferent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
forrester?
th-
the
assumption
seems
to
be
i-
in
the
state's
argument
that
if
you
you
restrain
a
person
in
order
to
then
choose
the
word,
convince,
coerce
him
to
do
something,
that
is
not
punishment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
this
punishment
if
you're
doing
this
in
order
to
have
him
comply
with
your
w-
command?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
an
important
point
for
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
if
you
are
requested
to
advise
the
correctional
officers
in
your
state
as
to
the
standard,
the
constitutional
standard
they
must
observe
with
reference
to
restraining
inmates,
and
circumstances
like
these,
what
is
the
standard
that
you
tell
them
they
must
follow?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you're
their
attorney,
and
you
have
to
figure
out
what
we
mean
up
here
that's
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
well
i
i
don't
see
in
gates
and
i'm
reading
from
page
thirteen
oh
six,
where
they
talk
about
the
e-
t-
b-
being
put
in
awkward
positions,
though.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
don't
see
any
requirement
of
serious
harm
to
the
inmate.
