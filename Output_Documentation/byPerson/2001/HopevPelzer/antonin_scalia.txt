justice
antonin
scalia
wha-
and
what
what
case
establishes
that
proposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
physical
restraint
is
unlawful.
justice
antonin
scalia
wha-
wha-
what
precedent
in
particular?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
a
whole
variety.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
amounts
to
a
holding
that
any
single
one
of
them
would
have
violated
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the...
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
reasoning
follow
n-
that
that
line?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
opinion,
did
it
examine
each
one
individually
and
say
each
one
individually
was
cruel
and
unusual?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah...
justice
antonin
scalia
that
it's
fairly
included
within
the
within
the
question
granted,
that
it's
quite
impossible
for
a
a
judge
to
say
that
it
does
or
does
not
violate
a
clearly
established
constitutional
principle
if
he
doesn't
think
that
it
violates
a
constitutional
principle
at
all,
clearly
established
or
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
him
on
there
for
seven
hours,
as
far
as
we
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
indefinitely.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
the
prison
policy
says,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
d-
is
is
is
it
a
contention
in
this
in
this
case
that
that
he
was
prepared
to
go
you
see,
i
don't
understand
what
they
could
have
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
allegation
is
that
this
prisoner
refused
refused
to
work
in
one
case,
and
disrupted
a
work
crew
in
another
case,
and
according
to
the
prison
policy
i
mean,
you
have
to
do
something
when
he
does
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
disrupting
the
work...
justice
antonin
scalia
or
to
make
him
go
back
to
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
we
decide
in
your
favor,
you
want
us
to
lead
leave
open
the
question
of
whether
this
prison
could
follow
the
policy
that
it
that
that
it
has
in
effect,
namely,
only
restraining
people
this
way
as
a
means
of
inducing
them
to
agree
to
go
back
to
the
work
crew.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
even
even
if
i-
d-
d-
do
you
maintain
that
that
the
issue
of
whether
it
was
done
only
to
get
him
to
return
to
the
work
crew
is
not
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
he
was
just
put
on
there
to
punish
him,
and
he
couldn't
have
been
released
if
he
had
said
i'm
ready
to
go
back
to
the
work
crew?
justice
antonin
scalia
a-
and
you're
content
to
have
us
hold
these
officers
liable
when
a
few
years
down
the
line
we
may
find
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
was
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
they
would
be
stripped
of
their
qualified
immunity
even
though
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
was
wrong,
and
we
find
it
to
have
been
wrong
w-
when
we
finally
confront
that
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
don't
you
think
we
have
to
reach
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
defending
regulation
four
twenty-nine,
according
to
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
regulation
is
not
before
us,
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
s-
suppose
i
think
that
i
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
it
would
violate
the
constitution,
not
just
whether
the
eleventh
circuit
said
it
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
s-
so
what
makes
the
difference
is
,
you
you
say
stand
in
the
corner,
and
i'm
going
to
handcuff
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
degree
of
pain.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
understand
your
last
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
they
weren't
responsible
for
how
long
he
was
left
on
the
bar,
justice
antonin
scalia
which
which
makes
me
wonder
whether
it
was
your
burden
to
bring
in
the
regulation
or,
w-
rather,
whether
it
was
the
burden
of
the
plaintiff
to
show
that
these
defendants,
when
they
put
him
on
the
bar,
knew
that
he
would
be
left
on
the
bar
for
seven
hours.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
understand
why
why
that
wasn't
put
in
by
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
burden
to
say,
i
was
not
responsible,
or
is
it
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
say,
you
were...
justice
antonin
scalia
responsible
for
putting
him
onto
the
post.
