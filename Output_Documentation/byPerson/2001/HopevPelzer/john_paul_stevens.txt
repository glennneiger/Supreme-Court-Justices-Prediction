about
the
case
you
called
our
attention
to
on
page
eighty-nine
ninety
of
the
there,
according
to
the
m-
magistrate
judge's
opinion,
judge
putnam,
in
that
case
the
plaintiff
was
refusing
to
check
out
in
his
work
detail,
defendant
gates
gave
him
the
choice
of
either
working
or
being
handcuffed
to
the
security
bar.
justice

him
the
choice,
did
you?

also
no

for

hours.
justice

appeals
said
there
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
1995
alabama
was
the
only
state
that
followed
the
practice
of
chaining
prison
inmates
to
one
another
in
work
squads.
it
was
also
the
only
state
that
handcuffed
prisoners
to
hitching
posts
to
punish
them
for
disrupting
the
work
of
chain
games.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
punished
in
this
way
on
two
occasions,
once
for
fighting
with
another
prisoner
and
the
second
time
for
an
altercation
with
the
guard.
the
first
occasion,
the
handcuff
into
the
hitching
post
lasted
for
only
about
two
hours
because
the
petitioner
was
released
when
the
guard
decided
that
the
other
prisoner
had
started
the
fight.
on
the
second
occasion
he
was
handcuff
to
the
post
in
an
uncomfortable
standing
position
for
seven
hours.
during
this
period
he
was
given
water
only
once
or
twice
and
was
denied
bathroom
breaks.
petitioner
filed
an
action
against
three
guards
alleging
that
the
use
of
the
hitching
post
was
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
that
violated
the
eighth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
practice
was
unconstitutional
but
that
the
guards
were
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
because
the
applicable
rule
of
federal
law
had
not
been
set
forth
in
earlier
cases
involving
materially
similar
facts.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
courtâ€™s
holding
on
the
qualified
immunity
issue.
for
reason
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
clerk,
we
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
an
incorrect
standard
and
that
earlier
decisions
did
give
respondents
a
fair
warning
that
the
use
of
the
hitching
post
for
punitive
was
unconstitutional.
accordingly
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion

chief
justice
and

scalia.
