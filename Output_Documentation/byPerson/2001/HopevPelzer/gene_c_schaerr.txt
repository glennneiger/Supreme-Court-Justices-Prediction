mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
as
i
understand,
it
the
fundamentally
similar
requirement
required
a
a
much
tighter
fit
between
the
facts
of
the
two
cases
than
mat-
than
the
materially
similar
standard
does,
and
i
think...
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
it
seems
to
me,
justice
souter,
the
way
you
answer
that
question
is
you
is
you
look
at
the
case
law,
and
that's
what
at
issue
here.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
i
think
i
think
it
is
important
and
useful
for
this
court
to
to
make
the
link
to
the
habeas
context,
because
i
think
that
would
provide
greater
clarity
in
the
law.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
sure,
but
and
i
agree
the
two
situations
are
not
entirely
identical,
but
if
anything
it
seems
to
me
the
the
section
nineteen
eighty-three
context
raises
even
greater
federalism
concerns,
because
as
this
court
a-
as
this
court
recognized
a
couple
of
terms
ago
in
geyer
versus
honda,
litigation
can
often
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
of
a
statutor-
of
a
statute
or
a
regulation,
and
so
what
happens
in
the
nineteen
eighty-three
context,
as
illustrated
in
this
case,
is
that
courts
articulate
broad
rules
that
purport
to
govern
the
conduct,
the
day-to-day
conduct
of
elected
and
nonelected
state
officials,
and
so
it
seems
to
me
if
anything
the
the
federalism
concerns
are
greater.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
i
i
agree
with
that,
justice
o'connor,
but
the
s-
but
the
standard,
it
seems
to
me,
needs
to
apply
to
the
full
range
of
gov-
of
official
action
that
would
be
covered...
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
i
i
think
that
ultimately
is
the
answer,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
way
you
answer
that
is
asking
the
question
posed
in
saucier,
is
wha-
of
whether
the
two
cases
are
materially
are
well,
are
whether
there's
a
fair
distinction
between
the
two
cases,
which
seems
to
me
amounts
to
material
distinctions.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
i
don't
think
that's
clear
from
this
court's
depi-
decisions
at
this
point,
as
the...
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
at
at
worst
at
worst
i
would
tell
them
they
have
to
fol-
they
have
to
follow
the
standard
in
farmer.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
right.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
that
that's
right.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
f-
farmer
added
a
new
requirement.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
i
i-
no,
i
don't.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
harm
that
you
could
for-
foresee
from
that
and
i
and
he-
and
the
record
does
not
suggest
that
he
was
without
water.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
there's
no
allegation
of
that
in...
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
and
the
court
of
appeals...
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
this
court
has
the
ability
to
review
the
summary
j-
judgment
record
de
novo,
and
it's
not
a
long
record.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
public
official
shouldn't
be
held
liable
under
section
nineteen
eighty-three,
or
shouldn't
be
stripped
of
his
his
or
her
qualified
immunity
except
on
the
basis
of
his
or
her
own
actions
based
on
reasonable
inferences
from
the
summary
judgment
record.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
with
respect
to
some
of
the
activity,
yes.
