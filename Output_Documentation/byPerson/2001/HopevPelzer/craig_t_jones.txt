mr.
craig
t.
jones
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
under
united
states
versus
lanier,
the
law
was
clearly
established
for
purposes
of
qualified
immunity
when
it
gives
officials
fair
warning
that
their
conduct
is
unlawful.
the
fair
warning
standard
is
met
when
a
rule
laid
out
by
prior
law
applies
with
obvious
clarity
to
the
conduct
in
question,
even
if
the
rule
arises
from
a
case
involving
different
facts.
the
materially
similar
facts
requirement
of
the
eleventh
circuit
is
an
unwarranted
gloss
upon
the
fair
warning
standard,
just
like
the
fundamentally
similar
facts
requirement
which
this
court
unanimously
rejected
in
lanier.
it
it
is
an
impermissible
gloss
because
it
emphasizes
similarity
of
fact
over
clarity
of
ruling.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
the
rule
established
by
the
eleventh
circuit's
own
precedent
is
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
punish
an
inmate
through
the
use
of
restraint,
and
restraint
is
punitive
if
it
goes
beyond
the
point
in
time
which
is
necessary
to
quell
a
disturbance
or
immediate
threat.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
no,
your
honor.
restraint
inc-
involves
total
physical
immobility
coupled
with
the
pain
and
discomfort
attendant
to
that.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well,
there
is
a
body...
that
any
any...
mr.
craig
t.
jones
physical
restraint,
the
precedents
speak
of
physical
restraint
to
a
fixed
object.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
gates
v
collier
is
the
first
case
of
a
body
of
law
which
has
developed
in
our
circuit,
justice
scalia.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
your
honor,
the
the
fifth
circuit
decision
in
gates
affirmed
the
dis-
district
court
decision
which
specifically
enjoined
each
and
every
one
of
those
punishments,
and
the
fact
that...
mr.
craig
t.
jones
yes,
your
honor,
if
used
punitively,
that
is
correct,
mr.
craig
t.
jones
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
it
examined
a
variety
of
practices,
and
and
and
and
those
practices
were
discussed
in
a
subsection
called
corporal
punishment.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
d-
drew
multiple
bright
lines
as
opposed
to
a
single
bright
line...
mr.
craig
t.
jones
with
respect
to
the
underlying
constitutional
violation,
or
with
respect
to
qualified
immunity
analysis?
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
never
squarely
addressed
the
constitutionality
of
continued
restraint
as
a
form
of
corporal
punishment.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
not
as
not
for
the
proposition
that
the
law
was
clearly
established,
with
regard
to
those
facts.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
based
justice
o'connor,
based
upon
the
grant
of
certiorari
by
the
court,
the
issues
raised
in
the
petition,
and
the
grant,
mr.
craig
t.
jones
i
think
that
is...
mr.
craig
t.
jones
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
i
think
that
this
case
is
like
saucier,
where
the
court
acknowledged
that
the
first
step
the
the
inquiry
of
whether
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
made
out
by
the
the
facts.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well,
i
think,
bec-
j-
justice
kennedy,
because
the
the
the
the
certiorari
was
only
granted
on
the
second
part
of
the
saucier
test,
that
is,
on
the
clearly
established
inquiry,
the
court
could
limit
its
ruling
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
law
was
clearly
established
a-
and
whether,
specifically
whether
the
eleventh
circuit
applied
the
proper
standard...
mr.
craig
t.
jones
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
i
think
that
it
is
fairly
included.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
your
honor,
i
i
believe
that
the
first
the
issue
of
whether
there's
a
constitutional
violation
is
fairly
included
within
the
the
questions
which
were
granted
by
by
the
court.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
conduct
of
these
defendants
was
to
restrain
this
man
as
a
form
of
punishment...
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well,
i
i
think
it
got
into
the
case
because
the
respondents
wanted
to
argue
the
case
rather
than
the
law.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
yes,
that
is
correct,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
the
affidavit
of
the
plaintiff
was
referenced,
i
think
incorporated
by
reference
into
the
pleadings.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
the
the
plaintiff's
affidavit
sai-
is
that
he
was
left
on
the
hitching
post
for
seven
hours,
and
the
fair
inference
that
can
be
drawn
from
that
is
that
he
was
restrained
for
seven
hours
without
breaks,
and
there's
certainly
no
evidence
rebutting
that
with
respect
to
the
second
incident,
which
he
was
on
the
hitching
post.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
we
do
not
know
that,
your
honor,
although
we
do
know
that
it
was
their
expectation
that
he
be
restrained
indefinitely.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
yeah
justice...
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well,
justice
scalia,
he
in
both
instances
he
was
being
punished
for
fighting.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
which
subsided
at
the
work
site,
which
was
miles
away
from
the
prison
property,
and
after
he
wa-
in
each
instant
after
he
was
restrained
and
subdued,
and
whatever
disruption
he
was
a
part
of
had
abated,
he
was
put
into
a
van
for
twenty
minutes
without
incident,
s-
another
twenty
minutes
were
spent
transporting
him
to
the
facility
without
incident,
he
was
then
walked
without
incident,
without
the
necessity
for
the
use
of
any
force,
mr.
craig
t.
jones
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
if
they
were
in
the
record,
the
evidence
would
also
be
they
were
not
followed,
which
was
also
consistent
with
the
finding
of
the
middle
district
of
alabama
in
the
case
of
austin
v
hopper.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
yes...
mr.
craig
t.
jones
that
is
correct,
but...
mr.
craig
t.
jones
critical
time
element
here
is...
mr.
craig
t.
jones
it
took
them
between
the
time
that
the
disruption
had
abated
and
the
time
that
they
decided
to...
mr.
craig
t.
jones
him
for
past
conduct
which
had
occurred...
mr.
craig
t.
jones
hour
earlier
and
ten
miles
away.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
is
the
critical
time
element,
not
the
amount
of
time...
mr.
craig
t.
jones
it's
critical,
your
honor,
because
restraint
is
not
a
proper
form
of
punishment
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
not
as
a
form
of
punishment.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
yes,
your
honor,
because
if
you
fight
with
five
prison
guards,
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
escape
punishment...
mr.
craig
t.
jones
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
