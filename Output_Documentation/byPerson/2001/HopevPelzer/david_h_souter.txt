justice
david
h.

are
you...
justice
david
h.
souter
on
anything
beyond
the
restraint
itself?
i
mean,
in
the
facts
that
have
been
recited,
the
the
facts
include
leaving
the
individual
in
in
the
sun
without
a
shirt
on,
and
not
giving
him
bathroom
breaks,
and
pouring
water
out
in
front
of
him
to
taunt
him.
justice
david
h.
souter
position,
though,
is
that
all
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
the
substantially
similar
standard
is
is
the
proper
standard,
and
and
if
we
say
no,
it's
not,
it's
that's
like
lanier,
which
was
what
was
it?
substantially
identical,
i
guess,
wasn't
it,
justice
david
h.
souter
and
and
if
we
say
that
that
gloss,
the
substantially
similar
gloss
was
wrong,
what
you
want
us
to
do
is
simply
vacate
and
send
the
thing
back,
or
do
you
want
us
to
go
further
and
say,
no,
in
fact,
there
we
we
determined
that
there
can
be
no
sovereign
that
there
can
be
no
i-
qualified
immunity
here,
because
if
we
have
to
go
to
the
second
step,
then
we
have
to
get
into
the
issue,
it
seems
to
me,
that
justice
kennedy
is
raising.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
have
they
discussed
gates?
in
in
i
didn't
go
to
look
at
the
district
court
opinions,
though
you
cited
them,
but
did
those
opinions
discuss
gates?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
they
just
ignore
the
the
the
pre-eleventh
circuit
precedent?
i
mean,
w-
how
did
they
get
by...
justice
david
h.
souter
record,
that
i
understand
it,
to
indicate
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
let
me
ask
you
a
different
question,
though.
justice
david
h.
souter
may-
hi-
i
mean,
maybe
you're
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
mean,
but
it's
splitting
it's
splitting
it
pretty
fine,
it
seems
to
me,
and
i
i-
in-
wouldn't
it
be
better,
wouldn't
it
be
serve
clarity
better
if
we
in
effect
said
in
this
case,
look,
b-
stop
paraphrasing
the
standard,
and
just
stick
to
the
basic
standard,
and
that
wa-
is,
would
it
be
clear
to
a
reasonable
officer?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
regardless
of
how
they
paraphrased
it,
when
you
get
down
to
the
district
court
cases,
on
any
standard,
they
ought
to
win.
