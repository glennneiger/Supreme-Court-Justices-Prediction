the
court
ordered
st-
stopping
each
and
every
one
of
those
measures.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
allegations
of
the
facts
have
been
questioned,
i
mea-
one
point
was
about
the
lack
of
bathroom
breaks.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
had
not
been
found
below,
as
i-
and
it
hadn't
been
as-
even
asserted
in
the
in
the
complaint,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
his
the
plaintiff's
affidavit
said
that
specifically,
that
he
wasn't
allowed
bathroom
breaks?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that,
we
got
into
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
work
rules
were
not
brought
up
by
the
state
as
a
the
eleventh
circuit
said
specifically,
we
are
not
going
to
consider
these
work
rules
because
they
were
never
put
in
the
district
court
record
as
a
reason
for
the
officer's
behavior
in
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
case
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
because
it
wasn't
in
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
subsequent
clarifying
authority?
ga-
gates
was
a
specific
injunction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
are
assuming
the
the
fact
as
alleged,
that
it
was
used
here,
not
to
quell
a
riot,
not
to
keep
things
calm
in
an
interim,
but
as
a
means
of
punishment
because
that's
what
as
i
understood
the
injunction
in
gates
was,
not,
you
couldn't
use
restraint
in
a
temporary
situation,
but
that
you
could
not
use
it
si-
strictly
for
punishment
purposes...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
and
that,
as
a-
far
as
i
know,
hasn't
been
modified.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
didn't
bring
up
the
regulations
in
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
of
the
second
incident?
i
thought
there
was
no
activity
log...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
th-
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
post
post
gates?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then
it
it
seems
to
me
exceedingly
careless
for
the
counsel
who
was
appointed
n-
not
to
bring
that
to
the
magistrate
judge's
attention.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
the
m-
more
drastic
episode
in
this
case
was
the
second
episode,
and
there
you
can't
even
point
to
an
activity
loge.
[:log]
they
didn't
even
write
it
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whose
burden
would
it
be
to
show
an
entry
in
the
activity
log?
after
all,
the
prisoner
doesn't
is
not
the
custodian
of
that
log.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
says,
and
we
must
take
this
as
true
i
think
at
this
stage,
i
have
no
reason
to
say
i'm
willing
to
go
back
to
work
because
i
never
for
a
moment
said
i
wouldn't
work.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
that
a
c-
isn't
it
a
concern
for
the
state
courts
that,
because
m-
i-
i-
i-
here
we're
talking
about
an
officer,
and
did
he
follow
what
was
an
eleventh
circuit
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
talking
about
a
federal
court
overriding
a
determination
by
a
state
court,
so
i
don't
think
the
settings
are
similar.
