we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
oh
one
three
oh
nine,
larry
hope
versus
mark
pelzer.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case,
do
we
need
do
we
need
to
get
into
the
issue,
mr.
jones
of
what
this
co-
this
court's
holdings
amount
to
on
this
subject,
or
are
we
are
we
just
limiting
ourself
to
the
the
eleventh
circuit,
perhaps
the
the
old
fifth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
respect
to
each.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose
you
one
would
have
to
do
that,
yeah.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wha-
you
say
it's
criti-
wh-
why
is
that
critical?
i
mean,
must
they
decide
to
punish
him
instantaneously
or
never?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
no
kind
of
restraint
is
is
permissible?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what,
in
your
view,
is
the
governing
legal
standard
that
you
just
referred
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
th-
i
thought
yo-
you're
not
talking,
then,
about
a
substantive
standard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
we
we
start
with
a
pro-
prohibition
for
substantive
law,
pra-
the
prohibition
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
we
don't
get
into
the
question
of
of
our
own
view
of
whether
what
this
what
the
law
might,
or
the
result
might
be
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
the
result
could
be
one
thing
in
the
eleventh
circuit
and
another
thing
in
the
fourth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schlick.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
thank
you,
mr.
forrester.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schaerr.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-309
hope
against
pelzer
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
