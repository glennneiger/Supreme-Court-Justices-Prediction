a,
the
government
represent
that
that
was
not
pursuant
to
any
court
order,
i
take
it,
the
government
turning
that
over?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
mcmann
and
brady
cases
too
said
that
a
defendant
may
have
to
make
some
hard
choices.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
olson.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
individuals
don't
know
whether
they're
innocen-
innocent
or
guilty?
chief
justice
william

rehnquist
i'm
su-
i'm
sure
there
may
be
rare
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
le-
let's
let's
go
back
perhaps
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
that
you
say
you're
here
on
behalf
of
innocent
people
who
want
to
plead
guilty.
chief

rehnquist
hill
hill
was
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
case,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
i
w-
we're
not
talking
about
a-
any
obligation
of
the
prosecutor
in
hill.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
between
de-
defendant's
attorney
and
the
prosecutor
on
the
other
side
are
by
no
means
the
same.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
argue
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
there
was
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
i
take
it
you
certainly
don't
take
a
different
position
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
but,
you
know,
to
say
we'll
just
call
it
impermissible
conduct
because
we
want
to
get
it
done
isn't
very
satisfactory.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hubachek.

william
h.
