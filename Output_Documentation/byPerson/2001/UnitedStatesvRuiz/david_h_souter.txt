didn't
enter
an
alford
plea.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
go
back
to
a
variant
of
justice
scalia's
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
even
even
if
you're
going
to
imply
if
if
that's
going
to
be
your
standard,
it
seems
to
me
that
soli-
the
solicitor
general
has
got
a
point
when
he
says
if
the
ninth
circuit
test
is
going
to
be
applied
and
applied
with
your
gloss,
it
can't
stop
where
it
is
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
but
brady
i
mean,
brady
ultimately
comes
down
to
a
judgment
about
materiality,
and
and
materiality
in
the
sense
of
of
the
kind
of
evidence
that
disturbs
confidence
in
the
verdict
is
a
judgment
th-
that
can
only
be
made
in
the
context
of
the
entire
evidence
of
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
order
to
make
that
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
you
have
to
make
an
unreliability
argument
divorced
from
a
materiality
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
we
judge
that
materiality
at
i
mean,
i-
to
in
in
hill
and
lockhart,
when
when
you're
dealing
with
counsel,
you
can
at
least
say,
well,
if
if
they
had
been
aware
regardless
of
how
the
case
would
have
turned
out,
there's
a
way
in
which
it
makes
sense
to
say
that
if
they
had
been
aware
of
this
kind
of
evidence,
they
would've
said
we're
going
to
trial.
justice
david
h.
souter
or
you've
got
to
dispense
with
a
materiality
standard
entirely
and
say
anything
that
would've
had
any
tendency
to
exculpate
or
to
impeach
in
a
way
favorable
to
the
defendant,
if
denied,
supports
in
effect
a
a
claim
for
relief,
which
is
a
non
materiality
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
a
different
i
mean,
it
necessarily
is
a
different
standard
from
the
brady
standard
of
materiality
which
we
have
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
back
to
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
order
to
do
that
intelligently,
we've
got
to
know
what
the
trial
would've
included,
won't
we?
and
that
either
means,
number
one,
that
the
disclosure
has
got
to
go
to,
in
effect,
the
inculpatory
evidence,
or
it
means
at
the
minimum,
number
two,
that
the
state
has
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
say,
we'll
tell
you
what
the
inculpatory
evidence
would've
been.
justice
david
h.
souter
hill
it's
easier
because
we
know
that
trial
decisions
are
are
often
made
without
knowing
what
the
result
would
be.
