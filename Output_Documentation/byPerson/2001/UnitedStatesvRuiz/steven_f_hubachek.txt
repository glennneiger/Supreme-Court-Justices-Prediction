mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
yes,
there
is,
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
now,
a-
the
the
disclosure
of
material
exculpatory
information
is
essential
to
ensure
the
accuracy
of
criminal
convictions.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
justice
scalia,
the
the
system
does
not
first
of
all,
i
guess
the
first
protection
would
be
a
rule
eleven
type
factual
basis.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
oh
your
honor,
there
are
some.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
i-
i-
i'm
s-
i'm
sure
that
it's
not
tremendously
common,
but
the
important
thing
is
is
that
individuals
who
are
innocent
do
receive
the
same
incentives
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
no,
your
honor,
no-
not
at
th-
not
at
all.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
right.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
e-
your
honor,
the
the
fact
that
that
happens
exists
already.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
the
the
posture
of
the
case,
e-
as
has
been
discussed,
is
that
there
w-
this
is
a
sentencing
issue
where
there's
a
request
for
a
departure
based
upon
the
this
fast
track
program.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
y-
yes,
she
did.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
no,
justice
souter,
she
did
not.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
first
of
all,
justice
breyer,
the
this
system
has
been
in
place
in
the
southern
district
of
california,
which
has
this
enormous
caseload
and
all
these
drug
cases,
for
the
past
year.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
right.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
the
same
way,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
the
the
rule
that
i'm
proposing
would,
in-
indeed,
benefit
both
non
innocent
and
innocent
individuals.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
the
pro-
i
don't
think
that
any
judge
or
any
prosecutor
wants
to
accept
guilty
pleas...
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
the
protections
that're
in
place
don't
fully
account
for
innocence.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
the
the
concern
here,
justice
scalia,
is
not
evidence
that
you
know
the
lawyer
has
access
to
and
simply
misadvises
the
client.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
perhaps
what
i'm
saying
is
is
that
if
information
that
supports
the
self
defense
theory
that
is
not
in
the
possession
of
the
defense
but
is
in
the
possession
of
the
prosecution,
if
that
evidence
is
turned
over,
that
will
make
it
more
likely
that
the
innocent
person
will
go
to
trial...
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
y-
yes,
there
is.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
i
don't
have
a-
an
an
empirical
study
that
shows
how
many
such
guilty
pleas
are
entered.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
the
lee
case,
a
situation
where
the
individual
was
charged
with
an
offense
and
told
that
there
was
an
identification,
and
it
turns
out
that
the
identific-
the
the
witness
misidentified
him
and
that
then
the
lat-
witness
was
later
shown,
before
a
preliminary
hearing,
a
picture
of
the
defendant.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
my
response
to
that
is
is
that
we're
asking
for
a
right
based
on
brady,
and
brady
doesn't
provide
for...
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
i
i'd
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
no.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
i
agree.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
i
i
i
i
understand
that
this
is
a
case
where
there's
a
guilty
plea
and
we're
not
making
an
argument
that
she
that
ms.
ruiz
should
be
permitted
to
withdraw
her
guilty
plea.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
th-
th-
th-
there's
some
pretrial
discovery
right,
but
it's
not
extensive
and
it
oftentimes
it
doesn't
cover
the
types
of
information
that
has
led
to
potential
miscarriages
of
justice,
a-
as
i
set
out
in
the...
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
right.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
exactly.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
the
rule
that
we're
proposing
would
not
supplant
all
those
rules.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
th-
i-
i-
it
would
expand
it.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
i
i
i
i
can't
direct
you,
justice
breyer,
to
any
particular
rule
change
proposals
that
are
out
there.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
the
under
the
fast
track
program,
the
defendant
can't
file
any
motions
at
all,
but
the
the
what
happens
is
is
that
there
is
a
a
pre
indictment
offer
that's
made
and
the
pre
indictment
offer
is
usually
accompanied
by
discovery
in
the
form
of
i-
in
a
case
like
ms.
ruiz's,
the
reports
of
the
initial
inspectors
and
then
the
special
agent
who
comes
in
and
does
the
interrogation
and
does
the
sort
of
a
summary
of
the
other
individuals'
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
i
i
i
agree,
justice
breyer,
that
there's
no
rule
that
you
can
say
that
a
district
court
is
compelled
to
depart
in
any
case.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
the
the
the
district
court's
comment
related
to
whether
or
not
there
he
said
to
counsel
that
there
was
offer
and
acceptance
and
and
that's
it.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
the
solicitor
general
hasn't
been
framing
the
questions
related
solely
to
the
discovery
issues,
the
brady
issue
and
the
waiver
issue.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
that's
that's...
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
perhaps
cirt
was
was
improvidently
granted.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
yes.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
no,
certainly
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
no,
i
don't.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
right.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
no.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
justice
souter,
on
page
sixteen
of
our
brief,
we
have
a
block
quote
from
hill
versus
lockhart.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
the
brady
standard
for
materiality,
as
was
explained
in
kyles,
derives
from
strickland.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
i
i
think
that
it's
an
easier
application
post
trial,
but
it's
still
the
same
test
that
that's
that
we're
being
asked
to
apply
in
the
plea
situation
because
hill
versus
lockhart
says,
look,
if
counsel
doesn't
find
the
key
piece
of
evidence
and
you
plead
guilty,
then
we're
going
to
go
back
and
look
and
see,
well,
what
would've
happened
at
a
trial
if
you
had
that
p-
key
piece
of
evidence.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
w-
and
that's
the
same
approach
that
hill
versus
lockhart
requires.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
but
hill
is
a
plea
case.
