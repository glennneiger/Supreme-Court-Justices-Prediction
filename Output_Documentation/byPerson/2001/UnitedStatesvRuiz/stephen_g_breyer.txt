know
what
you'd
like
is
that
we
reach
the
question
of
this
impeachment
material
and
say
there
is
no
such
right
in
a
in
a
plea
agreement
context.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
how
do
we
get
to
your
issue
and
what
do
i
do
about
those
two
things
which
seem
tremendous
blocks?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
ask
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
much
i
can
find
in
this
record
that
says
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
be
individual
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
n-
normally
you
could
say,
okay,
the
government
doesn't
oppose
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we're
talking
about
balancing
and
basic
fairness,
i
guess
their
argument
would
be
with
fifty-seven
thousand
cases
going
that's
eighty-five
percent
or
ninety
percent
of
all
people
plead
guilty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
be
the
argument,
i
think,
the
other
way
in
terms
of
fundamental...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
you'd
have
to
say
that
i-
you're...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
that
isn't
what
brady
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
this
is
you're
asking
for
a
really
major
change
in
the
system.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
giving
all
the
evidence,
the
imp-
imp-
impeachment
evidence...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
same
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doing
is
is
you're
asking
us
to
open
up
the
plea
bargaining
process
and
piecemeal
to
bring
in
a
a
constitutional
rule
that
would
affect
one
aspect
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
get
a
grasp
of
that
by
reading
something?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you're
right
on
your
constitutional
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
really
not
what
he
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this,
that
y-
y-
you
could
say,
okay,
let's
just
hold
everything
in
abeyance,
get
to
the
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
has
held
that
the
constitution
requires
prosecutors
to
make
available
to
a
defendant
before
a
trial
--
that
is
important,
before
a
trial
--
exculpatory
information,
and
that
includes
information
where
its
evidence
affecting
witness
credibility,
at
least
where
that
credibility
would
likely
determine
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
held
that
the
constitution
not
only
requires
that
but
it
also
requires
prosecutors
to
give
this
kind
of
information
which
we
call
impeachment
information
to
a
defendant
before
the
defendant
engages
in
plea
bargaining
with
the
government,
and
the
ninth
circuit
added
that
the
law
forbids
the
defendant
to
waive
the
right,
even
if
the
defendant
wants
to.
we
agreed
to
review
the
case
because
the
government
told
us
that
a
requirement
like
that,
to
make
all
these
information
available
even
before
plea
bargaining
and
saying
the
defendant
cannot
waive
it,
a
requirement
like
that
would
threaten
the
plea
bargaining
process.
we
have
reviewed
the
case
and
we
conclude
that
even
though
the
constitution
does
require
providing
this
information
before
a
trial,
it
does
not
require
providing
the
information
before
plea
bargaining
or
the
entry
of
a
guilty
plea,
nor
does
it
forbid
the
defendant
from
waiving
whatever
right
the
defendant
may
have
there.
in
other
words,
we
agree
with
the
government.
for
one
thing,
we
cannot
find
any
theoretical
justification
for
the
ninth
circuit’s
rule.
the
court’s
earlier
cases
concerned
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
they
did
not
concern
the
plea
bargain,
and
a
plea
of
course
doea
have
to
be
voluntary,
and
the
defendant’s
waiver
of
the
right
to
trial
has
to
be
knowing,
intelligent,
and
with
awareness
of
the
circumstances.
but
these
latter
requirements
do
not
demand
provision
of
detailed
trial-related
information
such
as
impeachment
information
for
after
all,
a
defendant
can
knowingly
waive,
for
example,
a
right
to
remain
silent
and
then
answer
a
policeman
questions
without
first
knowing
the
specific
questions
that
the
policeman
would
intend
to
ask.
we
cannot
find
support
in
the
theory
of
the
thing
for
the
ninth
circuit’s
position
and
we
were
unable
to
find
support
in
any
other
precedent
of
this
court,
and
when
we
though
of
applying
the
due
process
rule
directly
to
the
circumstance,
we
found
that
the
rule’s
negative
effects
on
the
criminal
justice
system
would
outweigh
any
benefit
that
the
rule
could
provide
some
defendants,
and
it
would
be
on
something
of
a
random
basis.
for
these
reasons,
which
we
elaborate
in
our
opinion,
we
reverse
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
our
result.
