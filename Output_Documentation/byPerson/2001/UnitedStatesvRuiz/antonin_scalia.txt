i
was
i
was
going
to
ask
wh-
why
is
that
second
paragraph
there?
i
it
wouldn't
have
occurred
to
me
to...
justice
antonin
scalia
been
used
throughout
the
country
or
just...
justice
antonin
scalia
should
know
what
the
house
odds
are
before...
justice
antonin
scalia
before
he
rolls
the
dice
by
pleading
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
sort
of
a
different
concept
from...
justice
antonin
scalia
from
what
brady
was
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
want
it
to
go
further,
would
would
you,
general
olson?
you
you
would
not
want
us
to
adopt
a
rule
that
encourages
that
that
enables
innocent
people
to
more
intelligently
plead
guilty
when
they're
innocent?
justice
antonin
scalia
seems
to
me
we
should
do
everything
to
discourage
people
who
are
innocent
from
pleading
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
kind
of
a
legal
system
is
this
where
where
we're
going
to
design
our
rules
to
encourage
guilty
people...
justice
antonin
scalia
hear
about
innocent
people,
and
we're
trying
to
encourage
them
to
plead
guilty
so
that
they
if
they
know
everything
about
what
the
government
had
i
mean,
there's
something
wrong
with
a
legal
system
that
that...
justice
antonin
scalia
even
contemplating
such...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
i
object
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
so
tha-
and
that's
what
your
case
comes
down
to?
you
want
us
to
facilitate
the
pleading
of
guilty
by
innocent
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
needs
to
be
able
to
plead
guilty
so
he'll
he'll
serve
a
sentence
that
he
doesn't
deserve.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
the
person
doesn't
understand
that
there's
a
self
def-
this
person
doesn't
have
a
lawyer
who
tells
him,
you
know,
if
you
shot
the
person
in
self
defense,
of
course,
you're
not
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly
be
in
in
possession
of
the
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
adopt
a
system
that
will
enable
innocent
people
more
intelligently
to
plead
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
proper.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
your...
justice
antonin
scalia
is
an
easy
one,
mr.
hubachek.
justice
antonin
scalia
discuss
the
jurisdictional
point,
our
our
our
decision
would
stand
for
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
proper
case
could
mean
that,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
to
say
anything
about
it,
so
long
as
i
was
not
certain
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
