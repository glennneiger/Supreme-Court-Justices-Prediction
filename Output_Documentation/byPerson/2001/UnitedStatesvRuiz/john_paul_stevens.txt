mr.
solicitor
general,
that
the
rolling
of
the
dice
concept
can
apply
to
an
innocent
defendant
as
well?
and
they're
supposing
the
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer
know
there
are
th-
three
e-
wy-
eye
witnesses
who
were
going
to
identify
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
lawyer
what
kind
of
advice
is
the
lawyer
to
give
?
h-
hypoth-
hypothetically
we
have
an
innocent
client
who
has
a
very
severe
risk
of
being
convicted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
this
i'm
assuming
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
knows
he's
not
guilty,
and
nevertheless,
there's
a
risk
that
because
the
odds
are
so
heavy
if
you
get
convicted,
you
go
away
for
twenty
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
that
there
may
be
a
hypothetical
situation
out
there,
but
we
got
millions
of
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
fact,
the
the
the
relevant
discovery
rule
actually
prohibits,
as
i
read
it,
s-
discovery
of
some
material
that
you
say
this
rule
would
cover.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
a
troubling
concept
because
one
of
the
things
we're
we're
sort
of
trying
to
do
here
is
balance
the
system
wide
benefit
of
an
a
fast
track
program,
on
the
one
hand,
with
the
occasional
case
where
there's
a
risk
of
injustice
that
that
concerns
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
dismiss
the
writ.
