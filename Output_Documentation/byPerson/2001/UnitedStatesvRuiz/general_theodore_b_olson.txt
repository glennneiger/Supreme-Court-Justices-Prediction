mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
me-
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
ninth
circuit
has
created
a
new
constitutional
rule
for
guilty
pleas
that
is
neither
required
by
the
constitution
nor
warranted
by
this
court's
previous
decisions.
its
inevitable
effect
would
be
to
complicate
and
expose
to
collateral
attack
confessions
of
guilt
which
approximat-
which
account
for
approximately
ninety-five
percent
of
all
convictions
in
the
federal
system
and
to
stifle
the
market
for
plea
bargains,
which
this
court
has
described
as
an
essential
component
of
the
administration
of
justice.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
an
accused
cannot
enter
a
valid
guilty
plea
unless
he
is
first
given
all
evidence
in
the
prosecutor's
possession
which
would
have
a
reasonable
probability
of
discouraging
him
from
pleading
guilty.
the
ninth
circuit's
rule,
new
rule,
is
not
a
logical
extension
of
the
brady
brady
versus
maryland,
which
is
premised
on
concern
over
the
constitutional
fairness
of
criminal
trials.
brady
and
its
progeny
require
f-
disclosure
only
when
necessary
to
ensure
a
fair
trial.
in
fact,
in
brady
itself,
the
court
was
explicit
to
point
out
that
it
that
decision
was
premised
on
the
avoidance
of
an
unfair
trial
to
the
accused.
the
subsequent
cases,
which
have
expanded
upon
or
interpreted
or
explained
brady,
have
been
even
more
specific
with
respect
to
the
limitations
on
the
scope
of
brady.
in
us
versus
agurs,
the
court
said
the
prosecutor
will
not
have
violated
his
constitutional
duty
unless
his
omission
is
of
sufficient
significance
to
result
in
the
denial
of
a
fair
trial.
something
similar
was
said
in
us
versus
bagley.
brady's
purpose
is
not
to
displace
the
adversary
system
as
the
primary
means
by
which
truth
is
uncovered.
if
it
did
not
deprive
a
defendant
of
a
fair
trial,
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
there
is
no...
i-
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
constitutional
violation.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
and
i
also
have
it
in
on
page
twelve
of
the
joint
appendix.

page
twelve
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
the
answer
to
that,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
both
in
the
sanchez
decision
and
in
this
case,
the
ruiz
decision,
the
c-
ninth
circuit
went
further
and
made
it
clear
that
it
was
applying
the
rule
that
it
applied
in
this
case
to
all
exculpatory
material
which,
if
known
to
the
defendant,
might
cause
the
defendant
not
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
no,
it
was
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
it's
it's
not
in
the
record,
justice
scalia,
but
it's
my
understanding
that
it's
something
that
is
is
developed
in
particularly
to
deal
with
the
sanchez
case
which
the
ninth
circuit
had
already
decided,
and
the
presumption
that
the
ninth
cir-
the
ninth
circuit's
sanchez
decision
went
so
far
and
not
as
far
as
the
im-
th-
that
that
that
covered
the
impeachment
per-
material,
but
not
exc-
other
exculpatory
material
think
in
the
reverse.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
this
is
this
is
this
was
developed
just
in
the
san
diego
the
southern
district
of
california,
although
other
versions
in
other
places,
but
there's
no
standard
national
propo-
pr-
form
for
plea
agreements.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
the
ninth
circuit
let
me
answer
the
jurisdictional
point
first.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
violate
that
the
sentence
was
imposed
or
the...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
wa-
th-
and
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
perceived
that
the
def-
the
district
court
felt
that
it
was
barred
by
law
from
departing...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
and
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
felt
that
because
this
was
a
constitutional
right
that
the
defendant
was
h-
had
that
was
being
withheld
from
the
defendant
because
of
the
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
that
the
the
district
court
erroneously
presumed
that
it
was
prevented
from
going
in
a
in
a
in
a
direction
that
the
ninth
circuit
felt
that
it
could
go.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
it
see-
it
it
it
i
think
the
answer
to
that
latter
point
with
respect
to
the
individual
consideration
is
covered
by
the
fact
that
this
particular
program,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
district,
are
i-
they
may
be
it
may
be
frequently
occurring,
but
it's
individualistic
in
the
sense
that
entering
into
this
program
alleviates
a
substantial
amount
of
work
and
and
and
provides
a
substantial
benefit
to
the
prosecutor
in
that
district
without
which
the
prosecutor
may
not
be
able
to
enforce
the
law
on
all
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
law.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
precisely.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
it's...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
exactly,
justice
scalia.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
it's
taken
care
of
in
several
ways.

mr.

b.

no,
there's
nothing
unethical
about
the

trying
to
figure
out

i
i'm

either.
mr.

b.

well,
i
understand
that,
justice

mr.

b.
olson
this
court
said
in
bagley
that
brady's
primary
purpose
is
not
to
d-
d-
as-
brady's
purpose
is
not
to
displace

as

mr.

absolutely.
mr.

olson
i-
th-
the
court
said
that...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well
the-
i...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
would
answer
that
in
two
ways
.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
justice
breyer,
and
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
no
and
i'm
not...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
this
court
has
said
that
it's
perfectly
appropriate
in
the
adversarial
system
for
the
prosecutor
to
find
legitimate
ways
to
encourage
guilty
defendants
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
in
this
case
that
involves
that
issue
at
all.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that
would
that
would
come
out
through
the
d-
ru-
rule
sixteen
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
which
is
set
out
in
the
appendix,
i
think
three
a
to
five
a,
of
our
brief
on
the
merits.

i

i

probationary
period.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
yes,
i
believe
so,
justice
kennedy,
but
i'm
not
sure,
a
hundred
percent
sure,
factually
i
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that
is
not
an
easy
ca-
situation,
but
i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
believed
that
however
inartfully
the
district
court
expressed
it
or
incompletely
the
district
court
expressed
it,
that
the
that
the
district
court
was
saying
it
didn't
feel
that
it
had
the
capacity
or
the
ability
under
the
law
to
depart,
that
it
didn't
have
the
discretion
to
do
so.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
it
could
mean
that.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
we
we
believe
that
we
after
looking
at
it
carefully,
we've
decided
that
the
ninth
circuit
probably
was
right
under
the
circumstances,
although
you
could
argue
it
the
other
way,
and
that
this
k-
this
is
an
issue
that
is
presented
and
clearly
with
respect
to
the
the
the
legal
standard
that's
been
adopted
to
the
n-
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
which
is
in
play
today.
