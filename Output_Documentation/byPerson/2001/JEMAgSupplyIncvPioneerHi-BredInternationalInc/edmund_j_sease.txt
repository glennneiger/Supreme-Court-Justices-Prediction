mr.
edmund
j.
sease
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
response
to
my
colleague's
representation
that
pioneer's
sole
case
here
rests
upon
a
snippet
of
statement
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
'52
act,
quoted
in
chakrabarty
where
the
court
said,
machined
or
manufactured
can
include
anything
under
the
sun
made
by
man,
we
do,
of
course,
rely
on
that
piece
of
legislative
history,
as
did
chakrabarty.
but
our
case
rests
not
upon
that.
our
case
rests
upon
35
u.s.c.,
section
101,
which
is
in
the
regular
patent
statute
that
says,
and
the
plain
meaning
of
those
words,
as
confirmed
in
chakrabarty,
that
the
corn
plants
that
are
patented
here
are
either
articles
of
manufacture
or
compositions
of
matter.
or
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
under
the
definitions
cited
with
approval
in
chakrabarty,
they're
both
because
these
categories
of
statutory
subject
matter,
under
section
101...
that
is,
they
are
sort
of
a
gatekeeper.
you
got
to
pass
through
that
gate
to
go
on
to
the
next
criteria
of
whether
you
are
new,
useful,
or
nonobvious
and
can
get
a
patent.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
justice
kennedy--
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
--they...
that
is
our
position.
they
need
to
be
general
because
the
patent
law
needs
to
fit
ever-changing
circumstances
because
today's
science
fiction
is
tomorrow's
science,
and
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
foresee
what
tomorrow's
inventions
will
be.
and
so,
from
1793
till
now,
the
statute
has
been
crafted
and
interpreted
broadly.
and
the...
the
terms,
indeed,
have
been
construed
to
overlap.
and
so,
the
categories
that
are
expressed
there
are
not
necessarily
exclusive--
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
--something
to
fit
one
or
more.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
yes.
with
all
due
respect
to
my
colleague,
i
believe
he's
wrong.
the
title
35
patents,
the
regular
utility
patents,
require
novelty,
usefulness,
and
nonobviousness.
this
court
defined
how
one
determines
nonobviousness
in
graham
v.
deere
in
1966,
and
it
has
been
universally
applied
by
the
patent
office
and
by
the
courts
since
that
date.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
patents
that
we're
sued
on
here,
if
you
look
in
their
file
histories,
one
would
see
that
they
were
routinely
rejected
for
obviousness
by
the
patent
office,
and
that
was
the
big
hurdle
that
had
to
be
overcome
before
they
could
issue.
the
plant
patent
act
requires
asexual
and
requires
new,
distinct,
and
probably
also
nonobviousness.
the
patent
variety
protection
act
requires
new,
distinct,
uniform,
and
stable.
there
is
no
requirement
whatsoever
akin
to
nonobviousness
in
the
plant
variety
protection
act.
and
it
in
fact,
your
honor,
is
almost
a
registration
system,
very
similar
to
like
the
copyright
system
where
you
file,
you
fill
out
a
form,
and
it's
granted
without
any
kind
of
a
rigorous
examination
as
utility
patents
undergo
in
the
united
states.
and
our
system,
i
might
add,
is
recognized
as
one
of
the
stronger
ones
in
the
world
primarily
because
of
our
unobviousness
requirement.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
justice
ginsburg,
the
answer
to
that
is
there's
nothing
like
it
in
the
patent
world,
but
there
are
analogous
dual
systems,
if
you
will,
in
the
intellectual
property
world,
whereas
it's
common,
for
example,
for
the
same
tangible
item
to
have
both
design
patent
protection
and
to
have
copyright
protection.
that
was
looked
at
in
the
case
of
mazer
v.
stein.
it
is
common
for
trade
secret
protection
and
patent
protection
to
peacefully
coexist--
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
--i...
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
historically
that
it
came
about
that
we
have
these
three
separate
regimes
that
occur
for
plants
is
that
plant
inventors,
if
you
will,
were
being
discriminated
against
in
that
they
were
unable
to
comply
with
the
rigorous
requirements
of
title
35
for
a
regular
utility
patent
not
because
there
was
any
definitional
wrong
in
section
101,
but
because
in
application,
the
patent
office
was
routinely
rejecting
them...
and
i'm
talking
about
prior
to
1930...
as
products
of
nature,
and
the
inventors
were
unable
to
meet
the
written
description
requirement
necessary
to
get
a
patent,
so
important
to
a
patent
because
the
written
description
requirement
is
how
the
public
benefits
from
the
knowledge
from
the
patent
so
that
they
can
use
it
to
advance
and
build
greater
knowledge.
and
so,
the
plant
patent
act
of
1930
was
passed
to
allow
some
limited
rights
for
asexually
reproduced
plants,
and
the
plant
variety
protection
act
of
1970
was
passed
to
allow
again
some
rights
for
sexually
produced
plants.
now,
this
petitioner
would
turn
those
two
acts
and
their
legislative
history
on
their
head
and
use
them
to
limit
patent
coverage
when,
in
fact,
they
were
passed
by
congress
for
the
purpose
of
granting
some
coverage
that
was
like
a
patent
in
order
to
get
over
the
two
historical
hurdles
of
section
112,
written
description
requirement,
and
the
so-called
product
of
nature
doctrine.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
justice
ginsburg,
i...
there
is
no
real
record
on
that.
at
the
trial
court,
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
answer
was
filed,
and
then
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
filed,
and
that's
where
we
are.
there
was,
however,
a
transcript
at
the
trial
court
where
a
pioneer
lawyer
was
asked
by
the
judge
if
pioneer
gets
pvpa
certificates
routinely
with
respect
to
matters
that
they
also
get
utility
patents,
and
i
believe
the
question
was
answered
yes
with
respect
to
inbreds.
but
in
this
instance,
there
are
hybrid
patents
as
well,
that
there
are
no
corresponding
pvpa
certificates,
and
the
suit
was
filed
on
only
the
utility
patents.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
they
take
much
less
time,
yes,
through
the
department
of--
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
--if
at
all
you
ever
get
through
the
101
process.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
one
never
knows,
at
the
time
you
make
the
invention,
whether
you
are
going
to
meet
successfully
the
higher
standards
of
the
patent
utility
act
or
not.
and
so,
i
mean,
the
unique...
the
truth
is
that
i
think
everybody
in
this
world,
not
unique
to
just
this
client...
they
try
for
both
and
see
what
happens.
sometimes
they
are
successful,
sometimes
they
are
not.
i...
i
would
like
to--
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
--that's
right.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
that's
correct.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
your
honor,
i...
i
would
disagree
with
that,
respectfully.
under--
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
--the
theory...
the
theory
was...
and
one
must
look
at
the
statute,
your
honor.
the
save
seed
exemption
and
the
research
exemption
under
the
plant
variety
protection
act
are...
are
not
grants
of
rights
to
anybody.
they
are
simply
saying
that
by
doing
these,
these
are
not
infringing
acts
under
the
plant
variety
protection
act.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
well,
nothing
in
the
plant
variety
protection
act
or
the
plant
patent
act
or
its
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
ever
intended
to
take
anything
out
of
section
101
that
was
already
included
in
section
101,
and
that
included
these
plants.
they
were
articles
of
manufacture
and
they
were
compositions
of
matter.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
because
if
you
were
to
say
that
the
passing
of
the
plant
variety
protection
act
in
1970
somehow
is
an
implicit
narrowing
of
35
u.s.c.,
section
101
or
an
implicit
exclusion
of
subject
matter
from
that,
you
need
a
far
greater
signal
than
just
that.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
yes.
and
the
case
law
of
this
court
says
that
there
must
be...
they
must
be
plainly
inconsistent
in
order
to
have
a
repeal
by
implication.
and
that
is
an
important
standard,
that
plainly
inconsistent,
because
congress
needs
to
be
able
to
rely
on
that
in
order
to
understand
the
consequences
of
acts
that
they
are...
they
are
passing.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
what
the
farmer
does
who
wants
to
save
his
seed
is
he
can,
indeed,
save
those
seed
if
they
are
protected
under
the
plant
variety
protection
act
only,
but
not
if
they
are
protected
under
the
utility
patent
statute.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
he
can
pay
for
permission.
that's
correct.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
that's
an
infringement
of
the
utility
patent.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
he
does
own
what
he
purchased
but
only
in
the
volume
that
he
purchased.
he
cannot
self-replicate
that
because
the
right
to
exclude--
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
--under
the
utility
patent
statute
because
the
utility
patent
statute
gives
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
making,
using,
or
selling.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
he
purchased...
he
purchased
one
set
volume
of
the
product.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
the
recreation
of
that
by
planting
and
regrowth
is
a
subsequent
infringing
act.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
pardon?
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
there
is
no
specific
case
in
the
seed
area
that...
that
i'm
aware
of
that
holds
that,
but
it...
it
is
sort
of
analogous
to
the
repair/reconstruction
doctrine
in
the
utility
patent
statute.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
it
isn't.
but
one
of
the
reasons
why
utility
patent
protection
is
so
critically
important
to
people
in
this
industry
is
because
that
seeds
are
so
easily
copied
by
self-replicating.
and
so,
if
you
can
qualify
for
the
higher
standard,
you
need
to
have
that
higher
standard
because
of
the
ease
of
replication.
and
may
i
point
out,
your
honor,
we
know--
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
--what
does
who
do?
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
well,
hybrid
seed
is
only
good...
and
these
patents
are
on
hybrid
seed,
most
of
them...
is
only
good
for
1
year
because
you
cannot
take
the
seed
from
a
hybrid
seed
and
then
plant
it
and
get
the
same
plant
back.
that
does
not
work
with
a
hybrid.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
you
can't
use
the
descendants
of
your
original
seed
to
plant
a
new
crop.
you
sell
your
crop.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
you...
you
can
use
them
for
their
ordinary
intended
purpose
which,
for
example,
if
the
seed
is
soybean,
you...
you
sell
your
crop
at
the
end
of
the
year
like
a
farmer
does.
you
buy
more
seed
for
the
following
year.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
if
there--
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
--if...
if
there
is
utility
patent
coverage,
you
can't
do
anything
with
them
unless
you
make
some
sort
of
arrangement
with
the
patent
owner.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
we
are
not
operating
in
a
vacuum
here
about
what
congress
believes
is
correct,
your
honors,
and
i
would
like
to
make
that
point.
in
1999
in
an
amendment
to
section
119
of
the
patent
statute,
which
allows
foreign
inventors
to
take
advantage
of
their
foreign
filing
date
when
they
come
here
and
file
in
the
united
states,
we
passed
an
amendment
under
section
119(f)
that
allowed
foreign
breeders,
certificate
holders,
analogous
to
these
plant
variety
protection
act
certificates,
to
use
that
filing
date
in
their
foreign
country
to
get
utility
patents
when
they
come
into
the
united
states.
so,
congress
passed
a
law
which
is
implementing
and
enhancing
the
very
thing
that
is
occurring
here.
and
to
make
any
doubt
about
that
crystal
clear,
in
1994,
when
there
were
amendments
to
the
patent
variety
protection
act,
senator
kerrey
set
out
the
whole
regime
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
modification
that
occurred
in
1994,
explaining
utility
patents,
explaining
plant
variety
protection
act
certificates,
and
explaining
the
ppa,
and
noting
the
differences
between
them.
and
he
did
that
on
the
floor
of
the
congress.
so,
it
is
hardly
news
to
congress
that
this
is
and
has
been
occurring.
mr.
edmund
j.
sease
well,
i
don't
say
that
congress'
understanding
of
the
statute
is
irrelevant.
i
point
out
that
corn
plants,
which
are
the
subject
matter
of
these
patents,
fall
within
the
plain
meaning
of
the
terms
of
section
101,
and
therefore
are
a
patentable
subject
matter.
