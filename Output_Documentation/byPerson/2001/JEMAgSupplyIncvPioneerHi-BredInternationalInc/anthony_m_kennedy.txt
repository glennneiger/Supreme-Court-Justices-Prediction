justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
other
words,
there's
the
scheme
established
in
1930
and
it
is
both
more
inclusive
than
a
101
patent,
and
it
gives
you
fewer
rights.
but
that
isn't...
doesn't
mean,
to
track
justice
ginsburg's
initial
question,
that
this
is
an
explicit
prohibition
on
issuing
a
patent
under
101.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
want
to
say
if...
that
we
should
infer
it,
fine.
that's
your
argument,
but
it's
not
an
explicit
prohibition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
suppose
their
point
was
that
in
many
statutes,
if
a,
b,
and
c
are
covered
and
c
is
then
removed,
we
make
the
inference
that
c
is
not
intended
to
be
covered
any
longer.
but
in
this
case,
the
under
the
sun
language
shows
that
they
are
such
expansive
terms
in
101,
that
perhaps
we
don't
apply
that
usual
rule
and
that
you
would
prevail
because
of
the
terms
being
so
general
and
so
universal
in
their...
in
their
coverage.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
that's
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
that's...
that's
inconsistent
with
the
argument
you
make
on
the
first
half
of
the
case,
that
congress'
understanding
of
the...
of
the
statute
is
irrelevant
in
light
of
our
interpretation.
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
can't
think
of
a
machine
that
can
replicate
itself.
i've
been
trying
to
do
that.
[laughter]
now,
maybe...
maybe
that
indicates
that
plants
are...
are
different--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and...
and
that
we
should
pay
careful
attention
before
saying
that
the...
the
new
acts,
the
1930
act
and
the
later
act,
were...
were
not
intended
to
supersede
patent
protection.
