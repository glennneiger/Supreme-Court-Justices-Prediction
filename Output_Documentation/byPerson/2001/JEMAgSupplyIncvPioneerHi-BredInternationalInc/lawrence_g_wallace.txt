mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
diamond
against
chakrabarty,
the
plant
patent
act
and
the
plant
variety
protection
act
played
a
central
role
in
the
debates
between
counsel
and
between
the
court's
opinion
and
the
dissenting
opinions.
the
court
in
chakrabarty
rejected
the
position
of
the
government
and
of
the
dissenting
justices
that
those
two
statutes
showed
a
congressional
understanding
that
living
things
are
not
protectable
under
section
101
and
could
be
protected
only
insofar
as
that
subject
matter
was
covered
in
those
two
statutes
and
to
the
extent
to
which
it
was
covered.
the
court,
instead,
adopted
a...
a
broad
interpretation
based
on
the
plain
meaning
of
section
101
referring
to
the
anything
under
the
sun
quotation,
but
also
said
quite
specifically
at
page
313
of
volume
447
that
the
relevant
distinction
is
not
between
living
and
inanimate
things
for
purposes
of
applying
101,
but
between
products
of
nature,
whether
living
or
not,
and
human-made
inventions.
so,
there
is
no
doubt
that
all
categories
of
living
things
are
within
the
interpretation
of
101
that
the
court
adopted.
and
the
anomaly
of
this
case
is
that
in
petitioners'
contention,
the
court
is
being
asked
to
disfavor,
for
purposes
of
applying
section
101,
and
indeed,
to
exclude
from
eligibility
for
section
101
protection
the
very
subject
matter
for
which
congress
had
shown
special
solicitude
and
saw
a
particular
need
for
patent
protection
in
these
two
acts
at
a
time
when
it
was
doubtful
whether
living
things
could
get
section
101
protection.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
do...
i
can't
give
you
any
direct
answer
to
that,
but
there...
there
are
certain...
there
have
been
more
plant
variety
certificates
issued
than
there
have
been
utility
patents
issued
on
plants.
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
perhaps
could
provide
some
help
on
that,
but
i
cannot
at
the
moment.
i'll
see
what
we
can
do
on
that...
on
that
question.
as
of
september
30th
of
this
year,
the
department
of
agriculture
had
issued
5,022
plant
variety
certificates,
whereas,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
there
have
been
a
total
of
1,800
utility
patents
issued
for
plants
or
plant
components
such
as
seeds
and
the
like.
the...
the
pvpa
protection,
the
plant
variety
protection
act,
is
only
on
the
plant
variety
itself
so
that
the
availability
of
patents
on
seeds
and
other
plant
parts
is
available
only
under
section
101.
the
court
in
chakrabarty
itself
said
that
nothing
in
the
language
or
legislative
history
of
the
plant
variety
protection
act
indicated
any
intention
to
limit
section
101
availability
for
patents
when
the
standards
of
section
101
are
met.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
relevant
committee
report
on
the
pvpa
in
1970,
which
we
quote
on
page
22
in
our
brief
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
said
quite
specifically
that
that
statute,
the
pvpa,
quote,
does
not
alter
protection
currently
available
within
the
patent
system.
so,
we
see
no
incompatibility
between
the
two
systems
of
protection.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
depends
on
the
terms
of
the
license
agreement.
that...
that
is
within
the...
the
power
of
the
patent
holder
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that...
to
the...
you'd
have
to
interpret
what
the
arrangement
is
and
what
has
been
granted
and
what
has
been
withheld.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the...
if
the
plant
could
reproduce
the
same
seeds
that
are
patented,
he
could
not
make
and
use
the
patented
seeds
without
permission
from
the
license
holder.
this
license
is
not
silent.
it
appears
on
page
51
in
the
large
appendix.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
right,
yes.
and
the
license
says...
i
think
this
tells
you
something
about
the
law.
the
license
says
it
is
granted
solely
to
produce
grain
and/or
forage,
which
could
include
any
seeds
that
are
produced.
for
other
licenses--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
because
your
crop
can
be
used
as
a
means
of
producing
patented
seeds
and
reproducing
the
patented
plant
product,
and
it
becomes
a
form
of
manufacturing
of
the
patented
item
without
the
patent
holder's
permission
unless
arrangements
have
been
made.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
plants
are...
are
different
in
that
congress,
while
saying
that
nothing
was
intended
to
limit
section
101
availability,
saw
a
special
need
to
assure
that
for
plants
there
would
be
protections
available
even
when
it
was
doubtful,
whether
for
microorganisms
or
animals,
there
would
be.
we
now
have--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
exemption
is
for
purposes
of
that
act
only.
when
greater
research
and
development,
greater
disclosure,
and
higher
standards
for
qualifying
a
patent
have
been
met,
there
has
been
more
of
a
contribution
to
public
knowledge
which,
under
our
intellectual
property
laws,
justifies
a
greater
exclusive
right
for
a
limited
period
of
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
then
the
public
benefits
from
all
of
that.
it's...
ultimately
these
intellectual
property
protections
are
for
the
benefit
of
the
public.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
to
the
extent
it
goes,
but
of
course,
it
has
a
much
less...
lower
threshold
of
qualifying
for
eligibility
and
a
lesser
standard
of
protections.
the
anomaly
would
be
to
say
that
the
microorganism
and
animal
patents
issued
under
section
101
should
have
rights
that
are
not
available
for
those
who
invent
plants
when
it
was
plants
that
congress
wanted
to
give
special
assurance
for
in...
in
enacting
this
legislation
at
a
time
when
it
was
thought
that,
either
for
practical
reasons
or
because
of
doubt
about
the
applicability
of--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--all
the
plants,
patents--
