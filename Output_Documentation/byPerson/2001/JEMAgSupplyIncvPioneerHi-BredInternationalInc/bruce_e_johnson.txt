mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
35
u.s.c.,
section
101
is
set
out
at
page
19a
in
the
appendix
of
the
blue
brief.
the
patents
in
this
case
that
have
been
issued
on
plant
varieties
under
section
101
of
title
35
are
invalid.
they're
invalid
because
congress
has
enacted
a
specific
statutory
scheme
that
it
crafted
to
govern
federal
statutory
protection
over
this
particular
type
of
living
thing,
plant
varieties.
the
enactment
of
congress
by
this
specific
statutory
scheme
that
it
designed
to
provide
the
federal
right
to
exclude
others
from
reproducing
plant
varieties
evidences
congress'
intent
that
it
plant-specific
federal
statutory
scheme
is
intended
to
provide
the
exclusive
federal
statutory
means
of
excluding
others
from
reproducing
plant
varieties.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
i
do
not...
no,
that
is
not
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
right
that
the
patents
claim
in
this
case,
the
plant
patent...
or
the
101
patents
claim
in
this...
in
this
case,
is
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
sexually
multiplying
the
corn
plant
varieties
in
this
case
or
to
use
or
sell
corn
plant
varieties
that
have
been
developed
by
sexual
multiplication
and...
and
produced
by
sexual
multiplication.
so,
without
using
these
patents
to
exclude
others
from
the
right
of
sexually
multiplying
these
corn
plants,
the
patent
rights
contended
for
in
this
case
would
be
of
no
value
whatsoever.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
attribute
that
is
protected
under
the
plant-specific
acts
is
under
the
plant
right
of
protection
act
of
1970,
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
sexually
multiplying
that
plant.
now,
this...
the
statute
is
designed
for
particular
types
of
plants
that
require
the
ability
to
sexually
reproduce
on
a
large
scale
in
order
to
be
commercially
valuable,
and
these
are
plants
that
are
only
valuable
if
they
can
be
produced
commercially
by
seed.
now,
the...
the
corn
plants
at
issue
in
this
case...
the
patents
seek
to
protect
the
same
utilitarian
feature
or
attribute
of
these
corn
plants,
and
that
is
the
right
to
sexually
multiply...
exclude
others
from
sexually
multiplying
these
corn
plants.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
yes,
mr.
justice
souter.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
i...
mr.
chief
justice,
because
i
misapprehended
the
nature
of
the
question
and
i
thought
that
you
were
asking
about
the
attributes...
the
attributes
protected.
and
yes,
the
rights
that
are
contended
for
under
the
patent
would
be
rights
that
do
not...
that
do
not
include
the
exceptions
that
congress
has
specifically
legislated
in
the
plant
variety
protection
act,
one
of
which
would
be
the
seed
saving
exemption,
which
was
reaffirmed
in
the
'94
amendments.
and
another
crucial
exception
is
the
research
exception
because
by
the...
the
use
of
patents,
the
free
exchange
of
plant
genetic
material
which
had
occurred
prior
to
the
use
of
patents,
is
prohibited
by
patents
because
the
seed
companies
now
contend
that
under
the
patent
statute,
since
there's
no
research
exemption,
then
they
can
lock
up
the
genes
of
the
plant
varieties
on
which
they
have
obtained
patents.
those
are
two
important
distinctions
between
the
rights
conferred.
now,
section
2541...
section
2402
of
the
plant
variety
protection
act--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--yes,
your
honor.
there
are
many
suits
in
litigation
now
where
district
courts
have
held
in
a
judgment
against
farmers
for
saving
seed
that
are
subject
to
patents.
and
this
is...
this
is
even
true
in
cases
of...
for
example,
one
of
the
amici
in
this
case,
delta
and
pine
land
company--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--i
do
not
believe
that...
that
i
know
of...
that
a
seed
saving
case
has
reached
a
court
of
appeal...
a
court
of
appeal
yet.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
the
government
is
arguing
as
an
amici
for
pioneer,
for
the...
for
the
appellee
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
i
have
not
seen
anything
on
that
position...
that
position,
one
way
or
another,
from
the
pto.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that
this
case
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction.
with
regard
to
the
chevron
deference
to
the
pto,
the
congress
has
specifically
legislated
on
the
precise
issue
that
the
pto
has
decided,
that
is,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
it
has
authority
under
section
101
to
grant
patent...
utility
patents
on
plant
varieties.
congress
has
specifically
addressed
this
issue
on
three
different
occasions
historically
and
ruled
on
it.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
chevron
deference
is...
can
be
accorded
to
an
agency
when
congress
has
specifically
legislated.
further,
we
are--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--it
has
explicitly
stated
this
in
legislative
acts
on
two
occasions.
in
1930,
when
it
enacted
the
townsend-purnell
plant
patent
act,
it
amended
section
4886
of
revised
statutes
by
adding
to
it
language
allowing--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--let
me
go
back,
if
i
may,
for
a
moment,
and
i'll
answer
your
question
on
chakrabarty.
in
1930,
congress
placed...
or
added
to
section
4884
of
revised
statutes
the
limitation
on
the...
that
it
was...
the
right
was
limited
to
asexual
reproduction...
excluding
others
from
asexually
reproducing
the
plant.
but
it
is
important
to
note...
and
this
is
set
out
at
cert.
app.,
page...
appendix
42.
you
will
also
see
section...
i
think
it's
4888
of
revised
statutes.
and
in
that
section,
congress
in
1930
inserted
the...
or
put
in
the
provision
that
relaxed
the
written
description
requirement.
now,
if--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--this
is
in
the
petition
appendix--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--page
42.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
just
a
moment
here.
section
4888.
it
put
in
the
relaxed
written
description
requirement.
now,
there
were
two
reasons
why,
as
justice
ginsburg
points
out,
there
was
some
historic...
there
was
some
historic
feeling
against
patents
on
plants.
it
was
a
living
thing,
a
product
of
nature
doctrine,
written
description.
it
relaxed
the
written
description
in
4888.
if
the
language
that
thomas
jefferson
penned
in
1793,
which
is
the
definitional
language
for
utility
patents...
and
he
was
a
plant
breeder,
knew
what
plants
were...
if
that
language
already
subsumed
plants,
then
the
only
thing
that
congress
needed
to
do
in
1930
was
to
add
section
4888.
and
if
it
decided
that
it
wanted
to
somehow...
if...
if
the
language
that...
that
thomas
jefferson
penned
included
plants
in
1930
and
it
included
sexual
multiplication
of
plants
and
they
wanted
to
limit
it,
then
they
could
have
just
put
in
the
asexual
limitation.
but
what
they
did
is,
they
put
in
all
three
sections
in
1930
because
it
was
their
intent
to
expand
the
definitional
limits
of
section
4886,
which
was
the
definitional
language
that
thomas
jefferson
originally
wrote.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
we
have
to
give
meaning
to
what
congress
did
in
1930.
it
did
not--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--in
1950,
in
the
revision
of
the
patent
act,
congress
dissembled
section
4886
and
placed
the
plant
patent
language
from
4886
in
a
separate
chapter,
and
kept
the
thomas
jefferson
language
in...
and
placed
that
in
section
101.
and
the
other
language
from
486
and
488...
or
4888
and
4884
were
also
placed
in
chapter
15,
a
separate
plant-specific
act.
now,
if
the
language...
if
the
definitional
language
of
101,
the
other
definitional
language,
subsumed
plants,
there
would
be
no
reason
to...
to
take
that
legislative
action.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
what
the
court
did
in
chakrabarty
was
affirm
judge
giles
rich's
footnote
25
in
the
underlying
circuit
court
case,
application
of
bergy.
in
chakrabarty,
the
patented
item
was
an
oil-eating
bacteria.
now,
the
court
discusses
in
chakrabarty.
nobody
knows
exactly
why,
but
bacteria
are
specifically
excluded
from
the
plant
variety
protection
act.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
well,
in
chakrabarty,
justice
souter,
the
dissent
argued
that
the
existence
of
the
plant-specific
acts
evidenced
congress'
intent
that
no
living
thing
could
be
subject
to
a
101
patent.
the
majority,
5
to
4,
the
tie-breaking
vote
said,
that's
not
true.
it...
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
mere
fact
that
something
is
living
denies
that
item
potential
or
possible
section
101...
a
section
101
patent.
and
it...
it
discussed
these
plant-specific
acts.
then
in
the
last
paragraph
of
chakrabarty,
it
tells
us
the
two
ways
in
which
congress
can
evidence
its
intent
to
exclude
a
specific
type
of
living
thing
from
section
101
coverage.
it
says,
one,
it
can
just...
it
could
explicitly
do...
it
can
explicitly
state
that
carve-out,
and
it
used
the
carve-out
of
patenting
of
materials
that
could
be
employed
in
nuclear
weapons
as
an
example
of
a
specific
carve-out.
and
then
it
said
secondly
it
can
craft
a
specific
statute
designed
to
provide
protection
for
a
particular
type
of
living
organism.
and
in
that...
in
this
case,
that...
in
the
case
of
the
pvp
and
the
ppa,
that
is
plant
varieties.
and
justice
rich
stated
this
explicitly
in
the
underlying
opinion,
application
of
bergy,
which
the
chakrabarty
court,
of
course,
read
and...
and
was
aware
of
when
it
wrote
this
paragraph.
justice...
or
judge
giles
quoted
this...
this
piece
of
legislative
history
where
the
senator
said,
anything
under
the
sun
that
is
made
by
man.
it
is
this
piece
of
legislative
history
that
pioneer's
case
is
built
upon.
that's
the
foundation.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
i
don't
believe
that
the
chakrabarty
court
viewed
the
bacterium
as
a
plant.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
they
spoke--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--i...
the
chakrabarty
court
spoke
of
it
as
a
microorganism.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
and
the...
as...
as
i
read
chakrabarty,
their
discussion
of
the
pvpa
and
their
discussion
of
the
ppa
was
for
the
purposes
of
explaining
historically
how
they
evolved
and
to
disassemble
the
dissent's
argument
that
those
two...
that
those
two
specific
acts
meant
you
couldn't
patent
any
living
thing.
i
do
not
think--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--yes.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
if
it
would...
if
it
would
be
a
plant
variety
and
if
reproducing
by
dividing,
which
is
not
sexual...
it's
certainly
not
sexual
multiplication
as...
as
plants
do
it,
then
that
would
be...
then
the
decision
should
have
been
that
it
could
have
qualified
for
a
ppa
patent.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
yes.
it
would
not...
well--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--it
would
not
be
blocked.
it
would
not
be
blocked
from
a
101
patent
simply
on
the
basis
that
it
is
alive.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
yes.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
i
have
not--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--i
have
never
seen
anything,
you
know,
of
that.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
i
certainly
didn't...
it
took
pains
to
point
out
that...
well,
it
said
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
pvpa
may
have
exclusive...
or
explicitly
excluded
it
was
because
it
may
have
felt
that
it
wasn't
a
plant.
i
think
there
was
some
case
somewhere
that
they
cited
that
had
alluded
to
that.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
well,
i
saw
a
lot
of
that
in
amici
briefs,
but
there's
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
on
it
in
the
record.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
i
think
the--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--every...
all
17
corn
plant
varieties
that
are
the
subjects
of
the
patents
that
we
have
challenged
in
this
case
also
applied
for
and
obtained
plant
variety
protection
certificates.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
in
this
case,
they
do
have
both,
and
there's--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--first--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--right.
we
weren't
sued
under
the
pvp
act.
we
were
sued
under
the
patent
act,
number
one.
number
two,
we
never
sexually
multiplied
the
seed
nor
did
we
engage
in
any
act
which
involves
further
multiplication
or
propagation
of
the
plant.
and
under
the
plant
variety--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--we...
we
didn't
do
anything
to
infringe
it.
the...
the
section
2541(d)
is
set
out
at
page
18
of
the
appendix
of
the
blue
brief.
and
it
says
that
any
of
the
above
acts...
and
all
the
other
acts
that
are
listed
as
infringement,
which
would
include
selling...
are
not
infringements
unless
they
involve
further
propagation
of
the
protected
variety.
the
reason
that
that
provision
is
in
there
is
because
in
1970,
the
brokerage
business
in
seed
corn
and
cotton
seed,
soybean
seed
was
already
a
thriving
business.
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
to
inject
itself
into
marketing
situations
that
are
governed
by
state
law
or
by
the
federal
seed
act.
it
had
one
thing
in
mind
and
that
was
to
regulate
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
sexually
multiplying
plant
varieties.
it
wasn't
in
the
market
of
suing
people
who
just
bought
the
bagged
seed,
didn't
do
anything
with
it,
sold
it
to
farmers
who
just
planted
that
seed
and
took
it
to
the
elevator.
so,
it's
not
a
pvp
violation,
number
one,
and
number
two,
we
weren't
sued
under
the
plant
variety
protection
act
anyway.
we
were
sued
under
the
patent
act.
it
was
the
act
of
choice.
now,
the
1970
plant
variety
protection
act
provides
at
section
2581
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
provide
adequate
encouragement
for
research.
congress...
the
presidential
commission
was
convened
in
1965
to
decide
what
sort
of
protection
should
we
give
to
sexually
reproducing
plants.
in
'68
the
senate
patent
subcommittee
had
hearings
on
amending
title
35.
there
was...
there
were
objections.
it
took
no
further
action.
hearings
continued
in
the
agriculture
department,
and
this
1970
pvp
act
came
out
to...
to
provide
adequate
protection
to
encourage
research.
that
was
congress'
intent
in
crafting
this
statute.
they
set
up
a
separate
agency.
they
set
up
a
separate
board
with
mandated
representation
of
affected
political
interests,
including
farmers,
including
the
public
sector,
including
researchers.
they
set
up
the
seed
saving
exemption,
the
research
exemption.
now,
if...
if
the
argument
is
accepted
that,
well,
the
reason
that
congress
did
this
was
because
they
misapprehended
the
ability
to...
of
technology
to
advance
and
make
it
easier
to,
say,
identify
or
describe
a
plant
variety
or
because
of
some
other
technological
advance,
well,
if...
that
is
simply
saying
that
the
intent
of
congress
in
1970
was
based
on
a
mistaken
apprehension
or
something
that's
proved
mistaken
today.
but
to
take
that
position
assumes
that
if
congress
had
apprehended
correctly,
as
pioneer's
amici
said
they
should
have,
then
that
congress
would
have
simply
adopted
section
101
without
the
special
agency,
which...
without
the
board,
which
is...
which
has
to
have
representatives
of
experts
from
the
various
varieties,
without
seed
saving,
without
research,
without
all
of
the
distinctions
that
it
specifically
intentionally
enacted
in
the
plant
variety
protection
act,
and
that
is
too
great
a
leap
for
us
to
take
in
my...
in
a
judicial
setting.
it's
a
political
question.
it's
a
question
for
congress
to
answer
and
congress
has
answered
it.
everything
that
went
into
the
crafting
of
the
plant
variety
protection
act
was
the
result
of
politics.
and
that
is
if...
if
in
some
fashion,
which
i
see
a
lot...
a
lot
of
the...
of
pioneer's
and
its
amici's
argument
points
out
that,
well,
it
now
looks
like
its
a
better
idea
to
have
patent
protection
than
plant
variety
protection
act
protection.
well,
that
is
an
argument
to
be
made
in
the...
on
the
hill
to
the
congress
where
they
have
the
resources
to
examine
all
of
this
evidence
that
has
been
put
before
this
court
in
the
amici
briefs
that
is
not
in
the
record
in
this
case.
as
far
as
the
ease...
the
record...
the
evidence
that's
in
the
record
in
this
case
is
that
it's
harder
to
get
a
plant
variety
protection
certificate
because
there
was
the
corn
hybrids
that
were
patented
in
this
case.
the
inbred
parents
were
not
deposited,
only
the
hybrid
seed.
the
hybrid
seed,
when
you
plant
it,
you
get
all
different
types
of
plants.
you
cannot
recreate
the
hybrid
without
having
the
inbred
parents'
deposit.
the
pvp
requires
deposit
of
the
inbred
seed.
the
pvp
requires
that
you
give
the
breeding
history.
there's
no
requirement
of
that
for
the
patent.
the
pvp
allows
the
research
exemption.
why
is
that
important?
because
of
this.
the
dna
in
plants
is
a
storehouse
of
knowledge,
a
storehouse
of
genetic
knowledge.
the
rna
conveys
that
message
and
the
message
is
manifested
in
the
characteristics
of
the
offspring
of
the
plant.
only
when
you
have...
when
a
plant
breeder
has
the
opportunity
to
actually
grow
the
plant,
observe
it,
cross
it,
observe
and
test
the
offspring
can
the
plant
breeder
obtain
the
knowledge
that
is
in
the
ostensibly
patented
plant.
and
without
that...
without
that
opportunity,
then
the
full
disclosure
that
supposedly
is
made
under
the
patent
act
when
they
patent
plant
varieties
is
not...
is
not
made.
and
it
is...
it
is
an
extremely
important
matter
that
the
plant
variety
protection
act
guarantees
to
the
public,
and
that
is
the
free
use
and
transmission
of
genetic
material,
which
patents
are
being
used
to
stop.
there's
been,
as
you
know,
a
extreme
consolidation
of
the
agricultural
industry,
and
the
switch
to
patents
and
the
locking
up
of
plant
germ
plasm
is
a
key
impetus
in
that
consolidation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
