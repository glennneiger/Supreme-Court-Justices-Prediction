justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
respondent,
pioneer
hi-bred
international,
holds
17
utility
patents
for
its
inbred
and
hybrid
corn
seeds.
petitioner,
j.e.m.
ag
supply,
doing
business
as
farm
advantage,
purchase
pioneer’s
patent
of
hybrid
seeds
and
reslae
them
in
violation
of
the
limited
label
license
attached
to
the
bags
of
seeds.
pioneer
brought
suit
for
patent
infringement
against
farm
advantage.
farm
advantage
counterclaimed
with
patent
invalidity
arguing
that
sexually
reproducing
plant
such
as
hybrid
corn
plants
at
issue
are
not
patenable
subject
matter
under
section
101
of
tittle
35
of
the
u.s.
code.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
pioneer
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
also
affirm.
this
court
has
interpreted
section
101’s
subject
matter
terms
broadly
in
diamond
versus
chakrabarty.
in
that
case,
we
held
that
section
101’s
term
manufacture
or
composition
of
matter
include
living
things.
the
board
of
patent
appeals
and
interference,
subsequently
held
that
plants
are
within
the
coverage
of
section
101.
farm
advantage
argues
however,
that
two
more
specific
statutes
the
plant
patent
act
of
1930,
the
ppa
and
the
plant
variety
protection
act,
the
pvpa,
foreclose
utility
patent
protection
for
plants.
today
we
hold
that
these
plants
specific
statutes
do
not
diminish
the
breadth
of
the
subject
matter
terms
of
section
101.
the
ppa
and
the
pvpa
each
have
different
requirements
and
scope
of
coverage.
neither
of
these
plants
specific
statutes
conflicts
with
conferring
utility
patent
protection
to
plants.
as
utility
patents
have
more
stringent
requirements
and
generally
more
extensive
protection.
moreover,
we
recognized
that
the
patent
and
trademark
office
has
assigned
over
1800
utility
patents
for
new
plant
breeds
in
the
last
16
years,
and
there
has
been
no
indication
from
either
congress
or
agencies
with
expertise
that
such
coverage
is
inconsistent
with
the
ppa
or
the
pvpa.
we
decline
to
narrow
the
reach
of
section
101
where
congress
has
given
us
no
indication
that
it
intends
this
result.
to
do
so
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
forward-looking
nature
of
the
patent
law.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
has
joined.
justice
o’connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
