bader

does
the
pto
have
a
position
on
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
this
case
doesn't
focus
on
the
saving
seed
exception.
but
in
distinguishing
the
utility
patent
from
a
pvp
certificate,
or
whatever
it
is,
you
have
pointed
out
that
the
utility
patent
is
more
beneficial
to
the
patent
holder
because
the
farmer
can't
even
use
the
descendants
of
the
first
seeds
to
plant
again.
so
that...
that's...
and
i
asked
you
if
the...
that...
that
was
the
position,
that
that's
the
interpretation
of
the
utility
patent,
that
is
the
interpretation
of
the
pto.
and
i
think
you
said
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
far
as
the...
the
issue
that
is
before
us,
we
do
have
a
position
of
the
pto
and
of
the
federal
circuit,
both
having
more
expertise
than
the
rest
of
the
federal
court
we're
on
in
these
questions.
don't
we
owe
those
decision
makers
some
deference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
has
congress
said
you
can't
get
a
utility
patent
on
a
plant?
congress
has
set
up
two
other
protective
regimes
that
are
different
from
the
utility
patent.
but
where
has
it
ever
says...
said
these
exclude
a
patent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
it
thought,
at
least
in
part...
it
thought
that
a
plant
couldn't
qualify
for
a
utility
patent.
so,
it
wanted
to
have
something.
science
has
advanced.
this
court
acknowledged
that
you
could
get
a
utility
patent
for
whatever
was
the
bacteria
that
was
in
the
chakrabarty
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
johnson,
there's
one
piece
of
this
case
that's
somewhat
disturbing
in
that...
in
that
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
it
is
relatively
harder
to
get
a
utility
patent,
that
you
have
to
convince
the
pto
and
you
have
to
have
more
documentation
and
involve
yourself
with
a
lawyer's
fee...
much
harder
to
get
a
101
registration
than
it
is
to
get
a
certificate
under
the
pvpa?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
are
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
you
suggesting
that...
let's
take
this
case...
that
this
particular
item
could
not
have
qualified,
maybe
it
wouldn't
qualify
for
a
pvpa
certificate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
so
they
do
have
both.
they
do
have
the
dual
protection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
thought
that
the
infringing
action
here
would
infringe
a
pvp
certificate
as
well.
i
thought
your
position
was...
was...
and
i
must
be
wrong
about
that...
that...
that
you
would
be
an
infringer
if
they
had
a
101
patent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
don't
have
a
101
patent,
so
they
have
nothing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you're
telling
me
they
did
have
the
dual
protection,
but
either
they
chose
not
to
charge
you
with...
with
infringing
on
the
pvp
protection
or
you
didn't
do
anything
that
would
infringe
that
protection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
other
situation
in
the
realm
of
intellectual
property
where
you
have
this
kind
of
dual
regime,
where
you
have
both
the
standard
kind
of
patents,
then
you
have
to
the
side
of
that
a
patent-like
protection?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
can
have
overlapping
patents,
trade
secrets.
but...
but
this
is
kind
of
a
specialized
patent.
it's
called
a
plant
patent.
that,
you
say,
is
unique
to
plants.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
ask
a
question
about...
about
this
particular
case?
is
it
true,
as
mr.
johnson
told
us,
that
you
have
dual
protection
and
that
you
sued
only
under
section
101,
that
all
these
17
varieties
also
have
plant
variety
protection
certificates?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
he
can
get
permission.
he
can
pay
for
permission.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
for
something
that
it
does
work
for,
is...
is
the
answer
but
you
can't
use
the
descendants
of
your
original
seed,
so
you
have
to
throw
them
away?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
but
what
can...
what
can
you
use
them
for?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
seeds
that
you
would
otherwise
have
saved,
the
seeds
that
you
would
have
saved
if...
if
it
were
only
plant
variety
protection,
you
can't
do
anything
with
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
justice
kennedy
said,
you
just
have
to
throw
them
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
what
would
it
take
to
craft
a
statute
specifically
designed
for
such
living
things?
when
i
read
that
sentence
in
chakrabarty,
i
was
a
little
puzzled
because
i
said,
well,
why
isn't
this
pvpa
a
statute
specifically
designed
for
such
living
things?
