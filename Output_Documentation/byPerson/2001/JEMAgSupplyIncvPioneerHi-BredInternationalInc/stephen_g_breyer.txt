justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is...
has
anybody
ever
held
it
was
a...
a
bacterium
is
a
plant?
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--did
any
court
ever
say
that
or
the
patent
office
or
somebody?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
the
dictionary--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
wait.
on
that
particular
point,
the
only
way
in
which
it
would
seem
to
be
of
some
significance
that
the
patent
statute
would
be
stricter
is
in
respect
to
what
you
just
said,
nonobviousness.
and...
and
the
other
you
could...
you
have
to
show
it's
new.
so,
in
the
one,
the
more
detailed
one,
you
have
to
show
it's
new,
and
in
the
patent
one,
you
have
to
show
it's
new
and
nonobvious.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
that's
a
little
bit
of
a
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
now,
what
conceivable
thought
would
have
been
going
through
a
congressman's
mind
to
enact
the
following?
he
says,
okay,
i
see
there's
this
difference
here.
so,
if
a
seed
is
new,
but
obviously
new,
i'll
let
the
farmers
save
the
seeds
for
next
year,
and
i
will
let
people
do
research.
but
if
the
seed
is
new
and
nonobviously
new,
i
won't
let
the
farmers
keep
the
seeds
for
next
year,
and
i
won't
let
people
do
research.
now,
in
other
words,
what
could
anybody
have
been
thinking
who
would
write
that?
and
on
your
theory,
that's
what
they
must
have
been
thinking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
question
was
not...
what
was
the
theory?
that
isn't
a
question
you
could
disagree
with
or
not
disagree
with.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
see...
let
me
show
where
i'm
coming
from.
a
property...
intellectual
property
involves
the
following:
copyright,
a
tax
on
readers
for
producing
books;
patent,
a
tax
on
users
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
invention.
those
are
the
wholesale
statutes.
patent,
copyright.
sometimes
congress...
and
quite
often...
says,
the
wholesale
statutes,
they're
too
wholesale.
we're
going
to
go
into
this
thing
and
retail.
now,
that's
what
they
did
here,
and
they
came
up
with
a
slightly
different
kind
of
protection.
so,
having
done
that
for
whatever
reason,
whether
because
of
mistake
or
because
of
this
or
because
of
that,
they
did
it.
so,
why
should
we
assume
they'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
wholesale
statute,
once
having
gone
through
the
work
of
written
the
retail
and
indeed
created
special
exemptions
of
importance
that
don't
exist
at
wholesale?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
had
before
them,
quoted
in
your
brief
i
think,
simon
rifkin's
committee's
report,
which
says
all
provisions
in
the
patent
statute
for
plant
patents
should
be
deleted
and
another
form
of
protection
provided.
that
was
the
president's
commission's
recommendation.
and
having
received
that
recommendation,
they
didn't
follow
it
completely,
but
they
did
write
some
things
in
detail.
so
why,
given
that
in
front
of
them,
should
we
assume
congress
wanted
to
go
back
to
this
wholesale
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
what
does
the
farmer
do
who
wants
to
save
his
seeds?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any...
anywhere
have
you
come
across
in
your
research
any
empirical
estimate
of
how
many
of
the
things
that
qualify
under
the
two
special
acts
might
also
qualify
under
the
patent
act
where
you
would
have
to
show
it
was
nonobvious
as
well
as
new?
is
there
any
guess?
did
anybody
ever
make...
you
know,
in
the
government
have
any
idea
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
noticed
that
there
is
a
document
filed,
which
i
got,
that
they
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
this
is
mr.
rifkin's
report
that
went
to
congress,
and
it
makes
the
recommendation
i've
referred
to:
no
protection.
then
it
says
backup
documents
will
explain
all
the
reasons.
so,
i've
been
trying
to...
they're
government
reports.
i've
been
trying
to
find
them.
i
can't.
does
anyone
know
where
they
are?
i'd
like
to
read
it,
frankly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
also...
they
also
wanted
to
be
sure
that
people
could
do
research.
you
see,
that's...
that's
actually
bothering
me
as
much
as
the
seeds.
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
people
could
do
research,
so
they
create
a
special
exemption.
and
now
your
reading
of
the
patent
law
will
wipe
out
what
sounds
like
a
very
important
special
exemption.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
why
i
wanted
to
know
the
empirical
contours
of
that
argument.
