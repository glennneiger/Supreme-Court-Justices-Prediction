justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
go
on,
has
any
court
ever
held
that
it
would
be
patent
infringement
for
the
farmer
to
save
the
seeds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
are
cases
in
the
district
courts.
how
about
courts
of
appeals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
when
chakrabarty
was
decided
people
didn't
look
so
carefully
at
dictionaries
as
they
do
now.
[laughter]
because
certainly
the
opinion
doesn't
say
this,
does
it?
the
opinion
doesn't
call
the
bacteria
a
plant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
view...
nobody
has
really
talked
about
the
infringement
under
the
basic
patent
statute,
but
if
i
was
a
farmer
and
i
just
bought
the
seeds,
you
tell
me
it's
a
patented
product
and
i
plant
the
seeds.
the
next
year
i
want
to
use
the
product
of
the...
that
plant
and
save
some
of
those
seeds
to
plant
the
next
year.
that's
an
infringement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that
an
infringement?
why
doesn't
he
just
own...
own
what
he
purchased?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're...
you're
saying
that...
that
the
infringement...
it's
not
just
an
infringement
of
a
license
agreement
or
anything
like
a
contractual
undertaking,
but
the
patent
statute
itself
is
sufficient
to
make
his
saving
seeds
an
infringement
in
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he's
not...
but
he's
purchased
it.
he's
purchased
the
product.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
best
authority
you
have
for
that
proposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
case
holding
that,
any
appellate
court
case
holding
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
analogous
to
running
a...
a
mimeograph
machine
and
requiring
the
user
to
use
your
paper.
it's
not
analogous
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what...
what
do
they
do
with
the
seeds?
they
throw
them
in
the
river
or
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what...
do
they
throw...
have
to
throw
the
seeds
away
or
something?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
can
i
ask
you
your
view
on
the
question
of
whether
a
person
who
buys
a
patented
seed
and
plants
it
and
then
gets
some
seeds
and
saves
them
and
then
replants
them
the
following
year,
would
he
be
an
infringer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the...
supposing
the
license
agreement
is...
is
silent
on
the
matter,
but
merely
identifies
it
as
a
patented
seed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
arrangement
is
that
the...
the
farmer
bought
some
seeds
knowing
they
were
patented.
that's
the
whole
arrangement.
would
he
be...
would
he
violate
the
terms
of
the
patent
and
infringe
the
patent
if
he
saved
the
seeds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
i'm
not
asking
a
question
about
the
license.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
a
question
about
the
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that
not
like
a
license
to
use
a
patented
mimeograph
machine
that's
licensed
only
to
use
with...
with
the
seller's
paper?
why
isn't
that
the
same
kind
of
thing?
