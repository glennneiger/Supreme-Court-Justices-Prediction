justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
specific
question.
under
the
pvp,
can
a
farmer
who
buys
the...
raises
a
crop
one
year
save
seed
to
use
for
himself
the
next
year?
if
that's
the
only
protection
that
the...
that
the
developer
has
is
under
the
pvp,
can
the
farmer
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
can
the
farmer
do
that
if
the
protection
is
under
section
101?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
isn't
the
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
yes,
there
is
a
difference
in
the
rights
which
are
conveyed
by
101
and
by
a
pvp
license,
respectively?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why...
why
shouldn't
chakrabarty
have
come
out
the
other
way?
because
chakrabarty
involved
a
plant.
it
involved,
i
guess,
an
asexually
reducing
plant.
i
don't
think
bacteria
reproduce
sexually.
and
it
seems
to
me
on
your
reasoning,
the
court
in
chakrabarty
should
have
said
this
is
the
paradigm
example
of
what
was
covered
by
the...
or
what
is
covered
by
the
ppa
and
therefore
it
shouldn't
fall
under
101.
and
the
court
went
the
other
way.
so,
explain
to
me
why...
why
chakrabarty
is
not
a
problem
for
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
they're...
they're...
yes,
the
pvp
but
they're
not
expressly...
i
guess
the...
the
ppa
doesn't
say
anything
about
them
one
way
or
the
other.
it
simply
remains
the
case
that
under
the
ppa,
this
is
a...
the
ppa
deals
with
a...
with
a
plant
insofar
as
it
is
a
non-sexually
reproducing
or
a
non-sexually
reproduced...
and
i
think
that's
the...
the
fact
that
the
court
had
before
it
in
chakrabarty.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
could
we
go
back,
though,
to
the
facts
of...
of
chakrabarty?
because
the
problem
that
i...
i
have
is
it
seems
to
me
that
on...
on
just
the
authorities
that
you're
speaking
of,
chakrabarty
probably
should
have
come
out
the
other
way
because
you
had
a
specific
statute,
the
ppa,
which
covered
this
asexually
reproducing
plant,
a
bacterium,
and
yet
the
court
did
not
say
that
the
coverage
of
101
was
thereby
defeated.
and...
and
maybe
i'm
missing
something.
i
don't
understand
why,
on
your
theory,
it
shouldn't
have
come
out
the
other
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
else
could
it
view
it
as?
i
mean,
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
went
to
the
dictionary.
i...
i
wasn't
sure
myself,
and
i
went
to
the
dictionary,
and
the
dictionary
says
it's
a
plant.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
a
generic
term.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
want
to
prolong
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
take
it
then
on...
on
your
position,
if
we
assume
that
the
bacterium
is
a
plant
and
it
asexually
reproduces,
the
decision
in
chakrabarty
should
have
been
that
it's
covered
by
the
ppa
and
there's
no
101
patent.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
therefore,
it
couldn't
qualify
for
a
101.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
on...
on
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
it
would
be
blocked
by
the
fact,
on
your
reasoning,
that
it
was
covered
by
ppa.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--my...
my
dictionary
holds
that.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
will
you
comment?
would
you
go
on
from
what
you're
saying
to
comment
on...
on
a
point
that
mr.
johnson
made
a
moment
ago?
as
i
understand
it,
the...
the
outline
of
the
argument
is
even
though
the
language
in
101
is
indeed
just
as
broad
as...
as
you
say
and
even
though
chakrabarty
said
living
things
aren't
excluded,
the
existence
of...
of
a
separate
statute
dealing
with
the
same
subject
matter
may
be
taken
as...
as
an
implied
repeal
to
some
extent
if
there's
a
conflict.
and
one
argument
for
saying
that
there
is
no
conflict
here,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
argument
that
what
is
set
up
by
section
101
on
the
one
hand
and
the
two
separate
plant
statutes
on
the
other
are
really
two
separate
regimes.
it's
harder
to
get
a
101
patent,
so
you
get
more
protection.
it's
easier
to
get
a...
we'll
say,
a
pvp
certificate,
so
you
get
less
protection.
and
therefore,
you
shouldn't
see
them
as...
as
conflicting.
you
should
see
them
as
kind
of
hierarchical
and
the...
the
applicant
can
choose
what
he
wants.
mr.
johnson
says,
as
i
understood
him
a
minute
ago,
that
that's
not
a
sound
argument
because
in
fact
he
says
it's
more
difficult
to
get
a
pvp
certificate
than
it
is
to
get
a...
a
101
patent.
and
he...
he
mentioned
a
couple
of
things
that
you
have
to
do
that
you
might
not
have
to
do
under
101.
would
you
comment
on...
on
that...
that
difficulty
point
of
his?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
consistently
with
your
answer
to
me
a
moment
ago
that
the
pvpa
certificate
is
almost
a
kind
of
registration
mechanism,
i...
i'm
assuming
that
therefore
it
probably
doesn't
take
long
to
get
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
you
would...
if
you...
let's
assume
you
filed
for
both.
you
would...
if...
if
you're
plant
breeder,
you
would
expect
to
get
your
certificate
rather
quickly,
and
you'd
expect
to
wait
longer
for
the
101
process
to
wend
its
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
the
one
thing
you
can
do
is
sell
them
so
some
creature
can
eat
them.
