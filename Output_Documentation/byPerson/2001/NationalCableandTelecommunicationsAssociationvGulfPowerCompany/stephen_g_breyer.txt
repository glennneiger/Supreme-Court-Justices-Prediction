i
mean,
as
far
as
i
read
d
and
e,
they
address
a
a
typical,
but
not
most
important,
regulatory
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
odd
about
congress
giving
regulatory
authority...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
and
reasonable...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
regulatory
agency
and
then
taking
out
two
areas,
that
it
happens
to
be,
that
the
industry
is
particularly
interested
in
and
negotiating
a
specific
formula,
while
leaving
others,
times
i've
seen
it
a
thousand
times
in
regulatory
statutes,
leaving
others
for
the
agency
to
proceed
under
normal,
ordinary,
just,
and
reasonable
rate
setting
authority.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
i
thought
the
purpose
of
this
and
i'm
really
asking
this
question
because
i
want
to
hear
what
your
argument
is
on
the
main
point
in
this
case,
if
it's
different
from
what
you've
already
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
jurisdictional
language
is
broad.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
narrowing
is
language
that
picks
out
two
categories
of
rate
setting.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
toasters
and
it
doesn't
include
billboards,
i
agree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
quite,
i
mean,
in
fairness
to
what
th-
h-
he
was
arguing,
i
mean,
a
person,
were
this
statute
not
to
apply,
could
still
go
either
to
the
local
telephone
company
regulators,
which
i
imagine
they
would
do
in
the
case
of
the
local
phone
company,
could
go
to
the
local
public
utilities
commission,
or
could
go
to
the
federal
power
commission
and
ask
them
for
the
same
kind
of
protection
that
the
fcc
might
give
them
if
this
act
does
apply.

i
imag-
well,
i,
sorry.
