academic
question
what
the
precise
rate
is
when
we're
dealing
with
a
court
of
appeals
decision
that
says
that's
irrelevant
because
there
is
no
authority
at
all...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
asking
us
to
say
that
f,
the
fcc
does
have
authority.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
basic
question
is
does
it
have
any
authority
to
come
up
with
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
feldman,
do
i
understand
your
argument
that
if
we
should
reverse
the
eleventh
circuit
and
say
there
is
fcc
jurisdiction,
then
it
would
go
then
it
would
have
to
await
your
ongoing
rulemaking
to
determine
which
category
this
is,
or
would
there
be
something
for
the
eleventh
amendment
to
do
on
remand
once
we
say
you
have
jurisdiction
to
do
something?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wait,
the
petition...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there's
an
awkwardness
that
i
don't
understand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
in
that
that's
how
you
read...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
legislative
history,
anything
that
indicates
that
congress
wanted
to
take
this
benefit
away
from
the
cable
systems
if
they
were
also
offering
internet
access?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
anything
you
want.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
the
price
of
getting
into
the
internet
for
a
cable
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
advantage
that
it
has.
