cable
television
system
to
the

system
itself
is
defined
as
a
set
of
closed
transmission
paths
and
associated
signal
and
generation
reception
control
equipment
that
is
designed
to
provide
cable
services
which
include
video
programming.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
it
could
only
be
wrong
in
two
circumstances.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler

i'm
sorry.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler

that
ground,
justice

a
good
thing.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
no.
