stevens
but
before
you
turn
to
the
next
section,
staying
with
a
four
for
a
minute...
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
attachment
to
a
pole,
duct,
conduit,
or
right-of-way
owned
or
controlled
by
a
utility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
language
apply
to
what
we're
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
literally
the
definition
does
apply
regardless
of
the
purpose
of
the
attachment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
cut
you
short
because
i
want
to
get
m-
th-
one
thought
out
of
my
mind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
r-
read
it
as
saying
provided
that
the
attachment
is
used
either
for
a
d
or
an
e
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
so,
those
are
exclusive
uses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
very
narrow
because
they're
only
talking
about
attachments
to
utility
poles.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
very
narrow
aspect
of
the
utilities'
overall
operations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
an
assumption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
two
kinds
of
rates,
these
are
the
formulas
for
those
two.
justice
john
paul
stevens
relates
to
rates.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
only
fixes
rates,
it
requires
access.
justice
john
paul
stevens
detailed
on
rates.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
just
tell
me,
where
does
the
term,
associated
equipment,
what
section
was
that
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i've
got
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
steindler,
is
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
a
local
phone
company
can
be
a
utility
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
all
right.
