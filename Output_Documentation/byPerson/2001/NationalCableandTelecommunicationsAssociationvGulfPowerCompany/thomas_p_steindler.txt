mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
i'm
sorry.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
it's
fourty-seven
usc,
section
two
two
four
b
one.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
it's
two
oh
six
a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
b
one
says,
in
pertinent
part,
that
the
commission
shall
regulate
the
rates,
terms,
and
conditions
for
pole
attachments.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
well,
the
government's,
on
this
issue
and
also
on
the
inter
issue,
internet
issue,
they've
they've
ignored
some
of
the
basic
rules
of
reading
a
statute,
and
what
they've
ignored
here
is
the
basic
rule
that
you
have
to
read
the
whole
statute
and
the
meaning
that
any
of
the
phrases,
like
any
attachment
here,
is
informed
by
context.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
of
course.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
of
course.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
if
that's
if
you
stop
reading
if
you
stop
reading
the
statute
there,
you
could
come
to
that
conclusion,
but
you
need
to
read
the
whole
statute,
and
if
you
do,
sir,
with
respect,
in
d
and
e
there
are
the
two
rate
formulas.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
sure.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
under
the
explu-,
w-
we'll
get
to
there
in
a
second,
but
there,
it's
under
the...
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
no
other.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
under
the
exclusio
unius
principle,
d
and
e
are
the
only
purposes
that
are
authorized
here,
and
others
are
intended
to
be
excluded.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
i
think
there's
several
answers
to
that
question.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
to
the
other
issue,
but
let
me
just
answer
the
question
quickly,
if
i
could.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
you'd
have
to,
in
order
to
come
to
that
reading,
you'd
have
to
separate
this
this
very
detailed
set
of
rate
formulas
from
their
general
jurisdiction
to
regulate.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
for
anything
other
than
cable
and
wire
service.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
i
i
think
another
answer,
and
again,
i
do
want
to
return
to
the
wireless
issue
because
it
does
tend
to
get
lost
in
the
shuffle
here.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
the
off-
white
house's
office
of
telecommunications
policy
wrote
two
letters
to
congress
expressing
that
concern
when
the
act
was
con-
being
considered,
and
congress
said,
in
the
legislative
history,
quite
clearly,
we're
giving
the
fcc
a
very
narrow
grant
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
not
only
are
they
talking
about
attachments
to
utility
poles,
but
they're
only
talking
about
attachments
to
utility
poles
for
two
kinds
of
services.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
if
you,
well,
certainly
if
you
read
this
canon,
if
you
read
the
statute
with
the
canon
of
exp-
of
expressio
unius,
you
there
needs
to...
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
well,
a-
again,
i-
th-
you
would...
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
i-
i-
indeed.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
i-
indeed,
indeed.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
cables,
and
associated...
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
associated
equipment
is
equipment
that
is
used
to
make
the
wires
and
the
cables
work.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
well,
again,
it's
wires,
cables,
and
associated
equipment,
and
not...
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
and
asso-
and
associated
wires
and
cables.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
just...
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
ejusdem
generis
principles,
in
that
phrase,
wires,
cables,
and
associated
equipment,
the
associated
equipment
is
subordinate
to
the
words
that
precede
it
and
is
delimited
by
those
two
words.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
it's
in
section
two
two
four
d
two
on
page
two
oh
eight
a
of
the...
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
you've
got
it?
okay.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
two
things.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
right.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
i
i
and
i
think
also
one
last
quick
point
on
on
wireless.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
the
ar-
that's
the
government's
argument.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
this,
under
this
fcc's
und-
under
the
fcc's
reading
of
this
statute,
which
is
i-
impermissible
u-
if
you
read
the
whole
statute,
they
have
they
have
decided
to
take
this
revolutionary
expansion
of
their
jurisdiction
to
regulate
this
tiny
piece
of
the
wireless
siting
market.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
no,
it's
not.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
a-
a-
a
and
b,
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
but
but
that's
indeed
what
they
wh-
what
they've
done.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
phone
company
is
exempted
from
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
they
have
very
few
of
their
own
poles.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
indeed.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
right,
and
i
i
you
know
understand
that.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
the
jurisdictional
language
is
not
the
as
broad
as
it
may
appear
to
be.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
yes,
but
it
also
doesn't
include
comingled
cable
and
internet
service.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
well,
congress
has
talked
sort
of
out
of
both
sides
of
its
u-
mouth
about
the
internet.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
indeed.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
but
these
cable
companies
are
are
not
mom
and
pop
shops
anymore.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
l-
l-
let
me
i-
the
answer
is
yes,
and
it
comes
in
the
definition
of
a
cable
system.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
well,
i'm,
what
i'm
arguing
here...
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
well,
y-
you're
you're
unregulated.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
if
the
if
it
gets
into
the
internet
business,
it
gets
put
on
the
same
footing
as
if
you're
a
local
phone
company...
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
for
a
cable...
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
there
are
two
big
competitors
in
this
business,
the
local
phone
company
which
is
unregulated,
and
the
cable
company
which
is
seeking
this...
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
about
eighty
or
eighty-five
percent
of
poles
are
owned
by
the
utility
companies,
fifteen,
twenty
percent
are
owned...
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
indeed,
but
the
the
re-
i
think
the
relevant
comparison
of
that
would
be
how
many
the
phone
company,
i-
it's
putting
it's
putting
the...
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
phone
company
on,
more
or
less,
the
same...
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
indeed.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
indeed,
it
is.
mr.
thomas
p.
steindler
thank
you.
