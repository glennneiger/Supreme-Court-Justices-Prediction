mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
under
the
pole
attachments
act,
the
fcc
is
required
to
regulate
pole
attachments
to
ensure
the
the
rates,
terms,
and
conditions
for
those
attachments
be
just
and
reasonable.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
two
particular
types
of
c-
attachments
are
covered
by
the
act.
the
first
is
an
attachment
to
provide
cable
television
service
and
commingled
internet
access.
that
means
that
on,
over
that
particular
wire
at
the
particular
time
is
traveling
both
cable
television
service
and
internet
access
at
different
frequencies.
the
second
type
of
attachment
at
issue
is
an
attachment
used
to
provide
wireless
telecommunications
services.
the
fcc
determined
that,
and
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
act
requires
that
both
types
of
attachments
are
covered.
the
operative
provision,
the
basic
coverage
provision,
defines
a
pole
attachment
as
any
attachment
by
a
cable
television
system
or
provider
of
telecommunications
service.
[inaudible]
mr.
james
a.
feldman
in
the
appendix
to
the,
our
petition
for
certiorari
right
at
the
end.
the
language
that
i'm
talking
about
now
is
on
page
two
hundred
and
five
a.
[inaudible]
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's,
i'm
sure
it's
in
our
brief
also,
but
it's
not
in
app-
it's
not
separately
set
forth
in
an
appendix
there.
[inaudible]
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
the,
in
,
sect-
the
section
i'm
referring
to
now
is
section
two
twenty-four
a
four.
it
says,
the
term
pole
attachment
means,
any
attachment
by
a
cable
television
system
or
provider
of
telecommunications
service
to
a
pole,
duct,
conduit,
or
right-of-way
owned
or
controlled
by
a
utility.
[inaudible]
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it's,
what
is...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
i
think
that
the
use
of
the
term,
in
particular,
cable
television
system,
it
has
to
be
part
of
the
cable
television
system,
which
could
be
reasonably
construed
to
mean
the
the
network
of
of
of
devices
that
are
used
to
provide
cable
television
system
service
to
people.
i
think
that's
correct,
and
i
think
probably
the
same
thing
is
true
with
the...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
telecommunications...
telecommunications.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
pr-
provider
of
telecommunications
services.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
fcc
hasn't
reached
a
conclusion
on
that
yet
because
what
the
fcc
concluded,
and
i
think
what
the
la-
most
natural
reading
of
the
statute
leads
to
the
conclusion
as
well
that
if
an
attachment
is
an
attachment
that's
used
to
provide
cable
television
system
service,
the
fact,
or
it's
used
by
a
cable
television
system,
the
fact
that
it's
also
used
for
something
else
doesn't
exclude...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
it
still
is
well,
it
would
still
be.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
i
wouldn't
quite
say
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
i
wouldn't
quite
put
it
that
way.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that
is
on
page
eighty,
the
best
place
to
start
with
is
eighty-seven
a
at
paragraph
thirty-three.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
don't
think
so...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
but...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
rate
issue
was
the
the
the
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
d-
did
not
address,
and
i
don't
even
think
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals,
what
the
proper
rate
is
to
apply.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
theoretically...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
the
agency
was
very
clear
that
it
jurisdi-,
its
basis
for
jurisdiction
is
a
four,
which
is
the
basic
coverage
provision
of
the
act,
it
could,
it,
and
it
said...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
agency
said.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
they
said
it
could
be
d
because
it
c-,
we're
not,
we
don't
have
to
decide
whether
it
is
a
t-
a-,
whether
the
internet
access
part
of
it
is
a
a
provision
of,
is
a
a
cable
service
because
if
it's
a
cable
service,
it's
covered
under
the
terms
of
d.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
quite
so.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
i
i
think
the
agency
was
quite
clear,
and
they
pinned
their...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
question
of
then
whether
it's
d
or
not
is,
just
has
to
do
with
the
question
of
what
the
right
rate
is.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
think
th-
that
the
point
is
that
is
not
a
a,
even
almost
not
a,
probably
not
a
possible
reading
of
the
statute,
and
certainly
not
the
one
that
the
fcc,
once
the
fcc
adopted
a...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
i
don't
think
that
that's
right
because
whet-
whether
the
agency
says
it's
d
or
not,
the
fact
is
that
a
four
covers
this.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
realize
that,
but
that
iss-
that
issue,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
a
difficult
one.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
if
congress
thought
that
again,
the
the
result
of
of
if
that
were
true
could
be
that
the
e
rate
might
apply
to
this
thing,
but
it
would
still
be
that
the
e
rate
applied.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
something
else
as
well.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
it
turned
out
that
this
additional
the
addition
of
internet
access
meant
that
it
was
neither
cable
nor
telecommunications
ser-
service,
that
that
that
additional
service
was
neither...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
neither
of
those,
then
the
fcc
would
have
to
figure
out
what
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
would
be
for
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
possible
the
fcc
could
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
want
to
justify
that
decision
because
what
the
fcc
decided
is
that
that
wouldn't
be
what
it
would
want
to
do,
and
it,
if
it
it
decided
that
if
it's
a
hybrid
like...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
yes
because
i
think
that
what
congress
wanted
to
specify
when
it
said
when
it's
cable
only
is
it
wanted
to
ensure
that,
and
and
this
is
actually
fairly
clear,
is
when
the
cable
companies
went
into
the
into
the
business
of
providing
telephone
service
to
people,
that
they
would
ha-
be
charged
the
same
rate
as
the
telecommunications
providers
who
were
newly
added
to
the
act.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
again,
that
would,
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
that
were
true,
that
could
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
fcc's
choice
of
rate
here
was
wrong
and
maybe
it
should
have
chosen
the
e
rate
or
some
other
rate.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
that
if
the
issue
was
preserved
before
the
eleventh
circuit,
they
would
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
what
the
right
rate
is,
and
they
d-,
look
at
what
what
the
fcc's
reasoning
was
and
whether,
you
know,
the
the
various
conclusions
the
fcc
reached
in
coming
to
the
d
rate.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it
might
be
worthwhile
to
point
out
that
the
f
the
fcc's
construction
of
the
act
is
entitled
to
deference
and
is
at
least
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
act.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'm
not
aware
of
what
the
basis
of
the
federal
power
commission's...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
wanted
was...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
sure
about
what
the
l-
what
the
authority
of
local
utility...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
is
over
the
poles
as
opposed
to
the
rates...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you.
