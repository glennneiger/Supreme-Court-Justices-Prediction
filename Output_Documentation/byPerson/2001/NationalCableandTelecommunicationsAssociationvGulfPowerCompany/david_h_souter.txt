justice
david
h.
souter
theoretically
it
could
be
neither.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
don't
you...
justice
david
h.
souter
as
a
result
of
that,
we
don't
know?
we
cannot
tell.
justice
david
h.
souter
for
us
to
say
to
the
agency,
you've
got
to
explain
to
us
what
you
at
least
believe
your
jurisdictional
basis
is
for
this
because,
depending
on
whether
your
jurisdictional
basis
is
the
general
provision
or
d
or
e
may
affect
that
that
that
may,
the
the
result
in
in
this
case
could
be
dependent
on
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
should
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
that
forces
u-,
in
other
words,
you're
saying
the
agency
made
it
clear
that
it
was
neither
d
nor
e.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
could
be
d.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it's
under
d,
we
we
review
it
strictly
within
d
terms.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
we've
got
to
decide
another
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
quite
clear...
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't
e,
but...
justice
david
h.
souter
quite
clear
on
anything...
justice
david
h.
souter
also
the
case
that
we
are
being
forced
to
decide
an
issue
which,
if
the
agency
were
clear
and
came
out
and
said
it's
d,
we
wouldn't
have
to
decide.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yeah,
but
that's
the,
that's
one
of
the...
justice
david
h.
souter
when
given
given
the
fact,
that
as
somebody
pointed
out,
i
guess
justice
scalia
pointed
out
earlier,
the
wireless
companies
always
have
some
wires.
justice
david
h.
souter
be
a
wire
on
the...
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
many
poles
do
the
local
phone
companies
own
own
in
relation
to
the
the
utilities
that
you're
representing?
justice
david
h.
souter
effect
of
what
justice
ginsburg
is
talking
about
is
going
to
be
significantly
different
in
relation
to
the
utilities
from
what
it
is
in
relation
to
local
phone
companies.
