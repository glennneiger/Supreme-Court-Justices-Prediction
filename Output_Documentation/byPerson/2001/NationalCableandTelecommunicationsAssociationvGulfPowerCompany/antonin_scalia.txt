justice
antonin
scalia
and
don't
you
think
it's
implicit
in
that
definition
that
it
mean,
in
,
not
just
an
attachment
by,
but
also
an
attachment
for
the
purpose
of
the
business
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
couldn't
put
up
a
billboard,
you
know
yo-
you
know,
i-
justice
antonin
scalia
is
inter-
internet
access
part
of
a
cable
television
system?
justice
antonin
scalia
fair
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
cover-
covered
under
e,
under
under
the
telecommunications
rate.
justice
antonin
scalia
talking
about
the
rates
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
purported
to
reserve
that
question,
hasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that
that
issue
is
up
in
this
case,
then,
whether...
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
internet
service
is
telecommunications?
justice
antonin
scalia
saying
that
the
that
the
that
the
decision
here
rests
upon
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
here
is
not
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
right,
it's
whether
the
commission
was
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
give
you
another
another
plausible
explanation.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
why
congress
put
cable
only
in
the
later
section
and
in
the
earlier
section
just
talked
about...
justice
antonin
scalia
anything
else
that
cable
does
will
be
telecommunications.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
they're
they're
they're
saying
even
though
the
section
says
you
charge
this
rate
when
it's
cable
only,
we're
going
to
say
you
can
charge
this
rate
when
it's
cable
plus
internet.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
ignore
the
the
doctrine
inclusio
unius,
exclusio
alterius,
and
you
say
these
are
the
rates
when
it's
cable...
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
fcc
has
come
and
said,
these
are
also
the
rates
when
it's
cable...
justice
antonin
scalia
to
me
a
little
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
attachment
of
a
cable
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
but
but
but
but
but
that
means
that
they
can
get
away
with
it
only
if
they
are
correct
that
in
in
choosing
to
apply
the
d
rate.
justice
antonin
scalia
selection
of
the
d
rate
is
wrong,
then
their
assumption
that
they
don't
have
to
get
into
that
question
is
also
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
you
say
they
haven't
sought
cert
on
it,
but
but
they're
they're
the
respondents
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
they're
they're
entitled
to
defend
the
the
the
outcome
below
on
any
reaso-
on
any
ground.
justice
antonin
scalia
talk
for
a
minute
about
the
attachment
of
wireless...
justice
antonin
scalia
care
about
it,
justice
antonin
scalia
internet
is
concerned,
you
wouldn't
be
kicked
off.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i-
it's
it's
even
funnier
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
includes
nailing
up
a
wireless
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
and
no
other...
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
we're
off
on
the
on
the
other...
justice
antonin
scalia
more
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
for
those
areas
that
are
within
its
special
expertise,
cable
and...
justice
antonin
scalia
specified
the
rates.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
let's
go
on...
justice
antonin
scalia
w-
what
you
mean
by
associated
equipment,
i
suppose,
is
i
don't
know,
joint
boxes,
lightening
arresters,
things
of
that
sort.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
couldn't
associated
equipment
mean
for
the
for
a
wireless
company,
i
guess
very
few
of
these
wireless
companies
are
entirely
wireless.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
why
couldn't
the
wireless
boxes
that
they
nail
on
these
on
these
poles
as
pole
attachment
be
deemed
associated
equipment
of
these
wires
that
they
use
elsewhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
be
associated
with
the
very
wires
and
cables
that...
justice
antonin
scalia
sites
that
are
used
by
a
utility.
justice
antonin
scalia
sites
that
are
owned
by
utility
companies.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
mandatory
carriage
of
wire-
of
of
of
of
wireless?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask
you
a
question
that
gets
you
back
to
the
other,
to
the
other
issue?
i-
is
it
i-
is
the
government
correct
that
you
lose
if
the,
if
even
if
the
rate
applied
by
the
fcc
is
wrong,
that
the
only
thing
you're
asking
us
is
to
say
that
the
fcc
has
no
jurisdiction?
it
wouldn't
even
matter
if
the
fcc
should
have
been
treating
this
under
e
as
telecommunications.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
say
it
would
be
treated
under
d.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
going
to
use
the
same
rate
that
congress
specifies
in
in
d.
justice
antonin
scalia
say
it
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
fetter
the
internet.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
lower
rate
a-
anymore.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
arguing...
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
off
the
pole...
justice
antonin
scalia

its
main
competitor
the
local
phone...
justice
antonin

you're

you're
the

position.
