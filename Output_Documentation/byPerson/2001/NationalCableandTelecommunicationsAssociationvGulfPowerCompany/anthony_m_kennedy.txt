but
let's
assume
that
fcc
determines
that
this
is
not
telecommunications.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
have
a
a
hybrid
cable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
more
for
a
hybrid
than
for
a
pure
cable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
wondering
why
that
can
be
because
it
has
no
jurisdiction
over
pure
internet.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
i,
but
my
question
is
why
can
it
possibly
charge
more
for
the
hybrid...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
page
reference
again?
excuse
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
if
if
if
you
characterize
b
the
right
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
[inaudible]
justice
anthony
m.

is
is
that
because
they
have
their
own
poles?

cable
television
companies
as
we
all
know
need
a
means
to
run
a
wire
into
the
home
of
each
subscriber.
i
don't
know
how
do
they
do
this.
well,
they
have
found
it
convenient
and
often
essential
to
lease
space
for
the
cables
on
existing
telephone
and
electric
utility
poles.
more
recently
wireless
telecommunication
providers
have
likewise
found
it
convenient
to
use
these
same
existing
poles
and
the
pole
distribution
structure.
now,
utilities,
in
turn,
have
found
it
convenient
to
charge
monopoly
rights.
congress
has
addressed
these
transactions
by
enacting
the
statutes
that
is
involved
in
this
case
and
it
is
called
the
pole
attachments
act.
the
act
requires
the
federal
communications
commission
to
regulate
terms,
rates
terms,
and
conditions
for
the
pole
attachments.
the
question
here
is
the
meaning
of
pole
attachment
as
applied
to
two
different
sorts
of
equipment.
so,
the
case
before
presents
two
questions
regarding
the
scope
of
the
act:
first
is
the
act
which
attachments
that
provides
both
cable
television
and
high-speed
internet
service.
more
and
more
cable
companies
are
offering
in
addition
to
the
cable
television
service
the
additional
service
of
high-speed
internet
access
which
is
sometimes
called
broadband
access.
and
the
question
is,
“does
the
pole
attachments
act
reach
the
attachments
that
are
for
this
so
called
co-mingled
purpose?”
second,
does
the
act
reach
attachments
by
wireless
telecommunication
providers?
and
both
of
these
questions
of
course
require
us
to
determine
what
pole
attachment
is
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
act.
as
to
the
attachments
that
provide
high-speed
internet
access
at
the
same
is
cable
television,
this
is
a
co-mingled
service.
the
act
defines
pole
attachments
to
include
any
attachment
by
a
cable
television
system,
and
we
think
these
provisions
resolve
the
question.
no
one
disputes
that
a
cable
attached
by
a
cable
television
company,
which
provides
only
cable
television
services
in
attachment.
if
one
day,
the
cable
provides
high-speed
internet
access
in
addition
to
the
cable
television
service,
the
cable
does
not
cease
at
that
instant
to
be
an
attachment
by
a
cable
television
system,
and
that
is
the
term
that
was
used
in
the
act.
the
addition
of
a
service
does
not
change
the
character
of
the
attaching
entity,
the
entity
that
the
attachment
is
by
and
that
is
what
matters
under
the
statute.
now,
this
result
is
more
sensible
than
the
ones
in
which
the
respondents
contend
on
their
view
if
a
cable
company
attempts
to
innovate
at
all
and
provide
anything
other
than
pure
television,
it
loses
the
protection
of
the
pole
attachment
act
and
subject
itself
to
monopoly
pricing.
the
resulting
contradiction
of
longstanding
interpretation
would
defeat
congress’s
general
instruction
to
the
federal
communications
commission
to
encourage
the
deployment
of
broadband
internet
capability.
this
congressional
policy
underscores
the
reasonableness
of
the
fcc’s
interpretation.
cable
attachments
providing
commingled
services
we
hold
do
come
within
the
ambit
of
the
act.
then
the
second
question
presented
is
whether
the
equipment
of
the
wireless
telecommunication
provider
is
subject
to
the
fcc
regulation
under
the
act.
now,
all
parties
agree
that
a
wireline
and
actual
line
is
subject
to
the
act
of
the
dispute
that
remains
then
becomes
a
narrow
one,
and
it
is
whether
or
not
some
attachments
by
wireless
telecommunication
providers
which
are
composed
of
distinctively
wireless
equipment
are
excluded
from
coverage
under
the
act.
again,
we
think
that
dispositive
text
is
that
which
defines
a
pole
attachment
to
include
any
attachment
by
a
provider
of
telecommunications
service.
telecommunication
service
is
defined
as
the
offering
of
telecommunications
to
the
public
regardless
of
the
facilities
used.
the
provider
of
a
wireless
telecommunication
service
is
a
provider
and
so
the
attachment
is
a
pole
attachment.
there
may
be
some
sorts
of
devices
which
are
not
attachments
under
the
act
but
the
attachments
that
are
here
at
issues,
at
issue
one
which
provides
the
commingled
cable
and
internet
service
and
the
one
which
provides
wireless
telecommunications
fall
within
the
heartland
of
the
act.
the
agencies’
decision
therefore
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
these
attachments
is
reasonable
and
is
entitled
to
our
deference.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
cases
are
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
on
the
first
question
regarding
commingled
internet
and
cable
services,
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissent
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
on
the
second
question
regarding
wireless
telecommunications
equipment,
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
o’connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
the
decision
of
these
cases.
