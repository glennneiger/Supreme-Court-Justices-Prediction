now
that,
that...
unknown

why
isn't...
unknown
speaker
said.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
concede
that.
unknown
speaker
l-
let
let
me
give
an
example.
unknown
speaker
those
prov-
unknown

over...
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
sixteen
usc
eight
twenty-four
a
and
b.
right?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
malone,
it...
unknown
speaker
is
that
you're
done?
unknown
speaker
from
west
virginia
to
the
north
carolina...
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one...
unknown
speaker
mr.
malone,
could
i
come
back...
unknown
speaker
which...
unknown
speaker
your
honor,
i
think...
unknown
speaker
from
the
rules
of
the
road.
unknown
speaker
said...
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
should
be...
unknown
speaker
considered
or
must
be...
unknown
speaker
and
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
it
misconstrued
its
statute.
it
didn't
simply
withdraw
its
hand.
it
misconstrued
the
act.
unknown
speaker
transmission
and
that
it
should,
therefore,
unknown
speaker
well,
then
it's...
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
an
essential
part
of
your
argument?
well,
where
does
it
where
does
it...
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
sa-
unknown
speaker
it
has
the
power
to...
unknown
speaker
the
transmission...
unknown
speaker
sale.
i
mean,
yeah,
but
transmission...
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
f-
unknown
speaker
six,
sixteen.
yes.
unknown
speaker
to
take
that
into
a-
unknown
speaker
i,
yes.
i
don't
i
don't
agree
with
that.
that
that...
unknown
speaker
yeah.
the
statute...
unknown
speaker
well
it
says,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and,
two,
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
the
basic...
unknown
speaker
can
you
sell
at...
unknown
speaker
what
we
want...
unknown
speaker
let
me
try
an
example.
unknown
speaker
the
traditional...
unknown
speaker
i'm...
unknown
speaker
of
this
statute,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
were
a...
unknown
speaker
they
said...
unknown
speaker
authority
over
that
because
they
have...
unknown
speaker
transmission,
unknown
speaker
transmission.
unknown
speaker
c.
unknown
speaker
customers,
and
that's...
unknown
speaker
we
want
the
federal
government...
unknown
speaker
it's
it's
it's
a
lesser
percentage
now
than
it
used
to...
unknown
speaker
the
the
the
power
flows
generally
over
the
system,
but...
unknown
speaker
justice.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what...
unknown
speaker
the
sale
of
the
transmission.
unknown
speaker
and
but...
unknown
speaker
but
th-
but
that
is
what
it
says
i
believe
because...
unknown
speaker
ferc,
that's
been...
unknown
speaker
and
and
and
you
think...
unknown
speaker
because...
unknown
speaker
because
of
its...
unknown
speaker
transmission
service.
unknown
speaker
part
of
it.
unknown
speaker
okay,
and
if
i
can...
unknown
speaker
them
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think...
unknown
speaker
ferc's...
unknown
speaker
yeah,
well,
there
are...
unknown
speaker
been
handled
so,
but
but
that...
unknown
speaker
right.
and
and
as...
unknown
speaker
states...
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
this
order...
unknown
speaker
service...
unknown
speaker
we're
going
to
regulate
it.
th-
that's...
unknown
speaker
transaction...
unknown
speaker
and
that...
unknown
speaker
i
believe
ferc
does.
i...
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's
essentially
what
ferc...
unknown
speaker
but
aren't
aren't
you...
unknown
speaker
the
traditional...
unknown
speaker
what
ferc
has...
unknown
speaker
wants
it
to
take.
yes.
unknown
speaker
permissible...
unknown
speaker
what
happened
here.
that,
is
that...
unknown
speaker
any
impediments
to
use...
unknown

properly
defer?
unknown
speaker
of
the
one
bundled

unknown

and
under
the...

that.
i'm
a
i'm
a
i'm
a
i

as
they...
unknown

so
and
your
reason,

may
i
ask
this
question?
unknown

right,
unknown
speaker
which...
unknown

it's
all
at
the
sufferance
of...
