we
we
usually
have
cases
in
which
the
agency
is
alleged
to
go
too
far.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
retail
in
states
which
are
which
are
un-
bundled?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
why
is
there
then
why
is
there
a
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
trying
to
reach
retail...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
that
wholesale
sale
can
be
regulated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
if
the
,
ferc
can
regulate
your
transmissions
and
you
go
to
ferc
and
say,
you
know,
our
transmissions
are
being
blocked,
why
can't
they
say,
we
will
exercise
jurisdiction
over
y-
y-
your
transmission
and
we
will
unblock
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
you
have
have
a
condition,
as
des-
described
by
u-
uh
counsel
for
enron,
and
they
say,
we
just
can't
transmit
our
gas
through
this
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
discretionary...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
different
things.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
you
have
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
jurisdiction
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
objection
to
our
saying
and
i
don't
know
quite
how
we'd
say
it,
that
the
fcc
has
jurisdiction
over
transmissions
of
bundled
sales
at
retail.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
a
two-step
pro-
say,
you
s-
say,
first,
unbundle,
and
now
that
you've
unbundled,
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
can
get
back
to
my
quest-.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
jurisdiction
is
is
thought
of
in
in
in
constitutional
terms,
i,
th-
the
answer
is
pretty
clear.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
a-
a-
again,
r-
referring
to
the
question
presented
that
you
drafted,
question
two,
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
properly
referred
to
the
commission's
determination
that
it
lacks
jurisdiction
over
retail
transmission.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
it
lacks
jurisdiction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
y-
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you-
your
your
position,
and
it's
it's
it's
a
very
odd
answer
to
a
question
to
say
that
we
may
say
we
may
have
no
jurisdiction,
i've,
we
have
no
jurisdiction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
regulates
a
bundled
retail
sale,
it
is,
in,
all,
for
all
practical
purposes,
in
part
regulating
transmission?
