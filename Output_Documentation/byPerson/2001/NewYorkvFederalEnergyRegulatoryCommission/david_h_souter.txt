are
you
saying
o-
one
o-
either
of
these
two
things?
either
transmission
regardless
of
the
rate
at
which
it
is
billed
is
is
not
essentially
interstate
commerce,
or
are
you
saying
that
you
simply
cannot
read
the
act
to
pick
up
that
activity
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
you,
w-
do
you
admit
then
that
th-
that
it
is
interstate
commerce.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
i-
a-
are
you
drawing
this
line?
you're
saying
that
ferc
has
the
authority
to
order
unbundling.
justice
david
h.
souter
saying
that
you
see
nothing
in
the
act
that
would
prevent
ferc
from
doing
just
what
mr.
cohen
wants
it
to
do
so
long
as
it
takes
two
steps,
so
long
as
it
orders
unbundling
first.
