mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
from
nineteen
ten
until
the
issuance
of
the
ferc
decision
under
review,
all
fifty
states
regulated
transmissions
of
electricity
to
retail
customers.
you
didn't
see
the
rates,
terms,
and
conditions
of
that
regulation,
with
a
few
exceptions,
because
the
rates
were
bundled
in
bills
that
charged
customers
for
all
of
the
elements
of
retail
service
which
are
basically
the
energy
itself,
or
the
commodity,
its
delivery
over
transmission
high
voltage
and
distribution
low
voltage
lines,
and
metering
and
billing.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
nineteen
thirty-five
congress
intended
the
federal
power
commission,
now
ferc,
to
displace
the
state
laws
that
required
that
regulation
from
nineteen
ten
until
nineteen
ninety-six
if
the
commodity,
the
energy
not
the
transmission,
but
the
commodity
is
unbundled
from
the
retail
customers'
bills.
the
ferc,
while
conceding
that
unbundling
was
never
contemplated
by
the
nineteen
thirty-five
congress,
nonetheless
has
taken
the
position
that
if
the
commodity
comes
out
of
the
bill,
in
order
to
give
the
customer
knowledge
to
effect
a
choice
to
buy
energy
from
a
utility
or
a
non-utility,
then
the
transmission,
although
it
still
remains
bundled
with
other
elements
and
is
never
shown
on
the
bill,
except
in
the
state
of
california,
becomes
a
new
and
separate
service
and
that
that
transmission
is
subject
to
preemption
so
that
the
states
have
to
leave
the
scene...
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
for
only
ferc...
what
if
there,
what
if
there...
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
i
don't
think
there's
any
question,
your
honor,
that
under
today's
commerce
clause
jurisprudence,
the
states
would
be
able
to
regulate
retail
deliveries
over
transmission
facilities,
particularly
within
their
own
states.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
exactly.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
well,
your
honor,
the
rate
of
interaconnection[:interconnection]
from
nineteen
twenty
to
nineteen
thirty-five
was
actually
greater
than
the
rate
of
interconnection
that
we
have
seen
since.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
i'm
saying
that
the
l-
the
latter
with
with
one
caveat.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
it
clearly
is
subject
to
regulation
by
congress
if
it
wants
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
we
don't
need
th-
the
states
do
not
need
to
get
into
the
question
of
which
transmissions
are
in
interstate
commerce
and
which
aren't
in
order
to
preserve
its
jurisdiction
over
retail
transmissions
because
congress
wanted
the
states
to
be
able
to
continue
to
regulate
retail
transmissions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
be-
because
the
th-
a-
as
the
colton
case
held,
there's
a
there's
a
bright
line
here
between
retail
and
wholesale.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
all
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
no,
we
we
we
don't.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
what
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
unbundles
when
one
unbundles
transmission,
the
states
don't
lose
it,
even
if
it's
out
there
by
itself,
if
it's
part
of
retail.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
because
when
le-
le-
let's
go
back
to
nineteen
thirty-five,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
now
now,
now
this
court
has
said
many
time,
your
honor,
your,
times,
your
honor
i
know,
justice
scalia,
you
don't
like
reference
to
legislative
history,
but
you
do
accept
ref-
reading
provisions
in
harmony.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
they
ar-
they
are
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
the
i
d-
i
don't
have
the
the
the
page
reference
off
the
top
of
my
head.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
no.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
if
there's
a
sale
for
resale...
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
the
the,
there
is
a
case
in
nineteen
thirty-four
at
two
pur
second,
where
it's
it's
almost
your
iden-
your
hypothetical.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
i
just
wanted
to
add,
justice
breyer,
that
if
you
look
at
two
oh
six
d,
that
calls
on
ferc
to
provide
costs
in
your
hypothetical...
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
if
enron
supplants
duke
and
sells
directly
to
a
retail
customer,
it's
going
to
be
purchasing
electricity,
selling
retail,
over
a
delivery
system
that
enron
does
not
own.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
not
quite,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
including
the
transmission.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
that
is
a
valid
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
your
honor,
we
have
situations
in
new
york
state,
for
example,
where
we
have,
ferc
has
regulated
ha-
curtailments
u-
over
transmission
systems.
mr.
lawrence
g.
malone
your
honor,
justice
scalia,
in
response
to
your
question
as
to
whether
ferc
has
given
the
authority
to
the
state
to
decide
prioritization
of
curtailment,
the
answer
is
no.
