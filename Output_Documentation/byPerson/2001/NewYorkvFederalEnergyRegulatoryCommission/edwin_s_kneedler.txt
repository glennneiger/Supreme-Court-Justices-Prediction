mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
sale
of
the
transmission,
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
does
not
in-
what
it
does
not
include
is
the
retail
sale.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well
th-
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
electric
energy
is
the
commodity.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
b
one,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
yes,
but
it,
but
for
example,
in
setting
a
wholesale
cost
or
excuse
me
a
wholesale
rate,
ferc
could
take
into
account
the
costs
of
transmission...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
wholesale
rate,
just
as
the
state
could.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
either
one.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
absolute-.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
if
i
could
answer
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
well,
it's
it's
an
independent
grant
of
authority.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yeah,
we,
absolutely.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
two
different
things,
and
i
and
i
think
it
was
maybe
you
who
put
the
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yea-
w-,
we
n--
don't
just
concede,
we
affirmatively
assert
that
we
do
have
authority.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
in
that
respect,
no,
because
i
i
think
that
all
that,
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
l-
let
me
let
me
just
modify
that
with
in
in
one
respect.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
exa-
and
and
the
court
of
ap-
the,
and
the,
what
the
cou-
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
in
this
case
essentially
looked
at
the
at
the
at
the...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
believe
ferc
does.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
ultimately
did
in
the
natural
gas
area.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
l-
let
me
be
clear.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
that
may
well
have
been
an
an
an
implicit
understanding
of
ferc,
but
if
you
look
at
the
order,
it
actually
never
says
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
th-,
i
i
i
cannot
speak
for
ferc
on
that
question
because
ferc
did
not
address
that
in
this
order.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i-
if
there
are
really
two
points
about
ferc's
power
here,
or
a-
authority
here
and
that
that
that
i
would
would
like
to
separate.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
did
properly
defer
because
the
predicate
is
that
there
is
a
single
transaction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i-
i-
i-
assuming
that
ferc
has
this
authority
as
they
stated,
they
didn't
disclaim
it,
but
ferc
in
this
order...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
nothing
in
in
the
act
in
the
parallel
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i-
but
the
rest
of
the
question
is,
when
it
is
sold
together
with
electric
energy
in
a
single
bundled
transaction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
even
even
even
under
order
eight
eighty-eight,
and
a-
what
order
eight
eighty-eight
does
is
decline
to
extend
the
plenary
rate
jurisdi-
the
plenary
jurisdiction
of
order
eight
eighty-eight
itself
over
the
transmission
component
of...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
as
long
as
they
are
bun-
as
long
as
the
state
hasn't
unbundled
it,
the
utility
has
not
unbundled
it,
and
ferc
has
not
exercised
whatever
authority
it
would
have...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
even
though
they
are
in
the
grid.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
let
me
let
me
let
me
make
let
make
clear.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
the
clause
in
two
oh
one
b
that
you
were
referring
to,
shall
not
apply
to
any
other
sale
of
electric
energy.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
leaving
to
the
states
the
the
authority
to
set
the
rates
for
the
retail
sale
of
electric
energy,
which
is
essentially
what
was
left
to
them
under
the
pennsylvania
gas
case
as
a
as
a
matter
of
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
i
think
what
is
no
power
is
where
the
the
transaction
remains
bundled,
ferc
may
characterize
that
in
the
same
way
that
it
has
always
been
treated,
as
as
a
single
retail
rate,
and
that
ferc
cannot
require,
as
long
as
the
transaction
remains
bundled,
that
the
that
that
a
separate
cost
component
for
retail
transmission
be
stated.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
i
don't
have
to
say
it
depends
what
you
mean
by
must
because
the
cou-
the
the
co-
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
that
was
the
only
way
to
read
the
statute.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
point.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
matter,
ferc
has
has
concluded
has
construed
the
statute
not
to
authorize
it
to
under
chevron,
the
the
the
agency...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
but
ferc
has
con-
now
construed
the
statute,
in
a
statutorily
permissible
way,
that
does
not
give
it
jurisdiction
over
the
transmission
component
of
bundled
retail
sales.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
as
long
as
the
transaction
remains
bundled.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
think
i
think
ferc
would
have
great
authority
in
deciding
how
to
identify
discrimination
and
how
to
deal
with
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
i
the-
there
may
well
be
limitations
on
that
because,
among
other
things,
the
the
the
act
preserves
to
the
states
the
authority
over
local
distribution
systems
and
over
retail
rates.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
if
it
finds
discrimination,
it
has
to
order
appropriate
relief.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
they
if
you-
if
a
util-
if
such
utility
is
connected
to
the
grid,
it
cannot
transmit...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
by
ferc
that
there
are
virtually
none
anymore,
and
that
that
that
while
the
the
act
does
preserve
intrastate
transmission
to
the
to
the
states,
there's
virtually
none
that
isn't
connected
to
the
grid.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
would
say
it
is
not
regulating
transmission,
and
and
i
and
i
think
that
that
is
what
the
court
said
in
in
pennsylvania
in
pennsylvania
gas.
