w-
w-
this
is
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
the
way
to
look
at
it
rather
than...
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
you
seem
to
concede
and
i
don't
see
why
you
do
it
that
the
right
to
regulate
transmission
includes
the
right
to
regulate
sale.
justice
antonin
scalia
bill,
you
mean
the
bill
that
the
customer
gets.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
give
us
the
usc
cites
of
those
things?
i,
it's
crazy
when
you
people
who
spend
your
whole
life
in
this
one
statute
use
the
old
the
old
numbers
instead
of
the
united
states
code
numbers.
justice
antonin
scalia
mist-,
mr.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
seem
to...
justice
antonin
scalia
question
about
the
words
in
the
statute?
the
statute
uses
an
and.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
justice
ginsburg's
earlier
question...
justice
antonin
scalia
focused
on
section
eight
twenty-four
b
two,
which
says
that
the
provisions
shall
not
apply
to
any
other
sale
of
electric
energy.
justice
antonin
scalia
including
the
transmission.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
up
to
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means
that
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
considered
part
of,
you
mean
discretionarily
should
be...
justice
antonin
scalia
you
agree
it
was
a
policy
choice
and
not
a
jurisdiction...
justice
antonin
scalia
it
gave
them,
without
limitation,
authority
over
transportation
of
energy,
but
not
without
limitation
authority
over
sale
of
energy.
justice
antonin
scalia
take
into
account?
i
thought
you're
saying
that
that
ferc
has
the
power
to
determine
a
a
a
component
of
the
retail
sale.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
has
authority
to
regulate
the
the
wholesale
sale.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
the
statute,
as
i
read
it,
is
separated
from
sale.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
reading
from
b
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
shall
apply
to
the
transmission
of
electric
energy
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
drawing
a
dichotomy
between
transmission
and
sale.
justice
antonin
scalia
must
be
taken
into
account.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
ferc's
regulation
of
the
cost
of
of
of
interstate
transmission
at
wholesale
comes
about
not
because
of
its
authority
over
the
transmission
of
el-
of
electric
energy,
but
because
of
its
authority
over
the
sale
of
electric
energy
at
wholesale.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
an
interference
with
the
transmission,
not
with
the
sale.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
authority
over...
justice
antonin
scalia
both
interstate
and
intrastate.
justice
antonin
scalia
government
to
determine
which
which
will
be
the
emergency
users
and
the
preferred
users
in
each
state
and
locality.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
always
been
a
product.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
it
it
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
it
is
i-
the
position
of
the
agency
hinges
on
the
proposition
that
the
the
power
conferred
by
by
section
eight
twenty-four
to
regulate
the
transmission
of
electrical
energy
includes
includes
the
power
to
regulate
the
sale
of
the
transmission
of
elec-
electrical
energy.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
that
were
true,
it
seems
to
me
that
eight
twenty-four
b
one,
instead
of
reading
the
way
it
does,
should
read
this
way,
the
provisions
of
this
subchapter
shall
apply
to
the
transmission
of
electric
energy
in
interstate
commerce
which
would
include
the
sale
of
that
transmission,
right?
and
to
the
sale
of
the
commodity
portion
of
electrical
energy
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it
should
have
gone
on
to
say,
and
to
the
sale
of
the
of
the
commodity
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
that
sale
of
electric
energy
at
wholesale
in
in
the
first
portion
of
it,
in
in
one,
only
referred
to
the
sale
of
regulating
the
sale
of
the
commodity
at
wholesale.
justice
antonin
scalia
authority
over
the
transmission
of
energy.
justice
antonin
scalia
very
unrealistic
reading
of
what
congress
thought
it
was
doing
when
it
wrote
this
thing,
that
that
when
it
when
it
spoke
of
the
sale
of
electric
energy
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce,
it
had
in
mind
only
only
the
sale
of
the
the
the
commodity
and
not
the
sale
of,
you
know,
the
transmission
and
the
entire
cost.
justice
antonin
scalia
can't
say
that
because
if
if
you
say
that
that
that
that
that
that
the
reason
you
have
that
authority
is
because
of
the
phrase,
the
sale
of
electric
energy
at
wholesale,
you
would
also
have
to
say
that
in
the
very
next
phrase,
the
sale
of
elect-
electric
energy
any
other
sale
of
electric
energy,
sale
at
retail,
would
also
include
the
transmission
component.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
exclude
the
transmission
component
from
both
of...
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
unquestionable
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
where?
where
where
where
does
the
statute
you
you
say
the
statute
leaves
the
retail
rates.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
ma-?
you
say,
may
characterize
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're
going
to
say
it
has
no
power,
you
have
to
say
must...
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
have
the
power
to
characterize
it
one
way
or
the
other,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
the
power
to
assert
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
done
differently,
it
could
move
in
to
regulate
it
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
ferc,
however.
