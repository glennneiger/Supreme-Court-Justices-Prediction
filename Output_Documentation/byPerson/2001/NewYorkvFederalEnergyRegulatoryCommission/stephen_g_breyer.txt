stephen
g.
breyer
well,
just
on
that,
is
it
the
case
that
if
in
nineteen
thirty-five
duke
power
owns
generating
facilities
in
west
virginia,
owns
lines
from
west
virginia
to
north
carolina,
and
owns
a
distribution
company
in
north
carolina,
all
one
company,
does
the
fpc
have
any
jurisdiction
at
all
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
your
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
would
say
if
that's
your
argument,
the
response
to
that
argument
will
be
this
is
an
unforeseen
case
in
thirty-five,
the
possibility
of
enron
supplanting
duke,
and
it's
close
enough
to
wholesale
sales.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
th-
what
would
,
suppose
ferc
says
or
suppose
i
read
it
as
saying,
since
you're
whipsawing
them
between
you
and
new
york,
look,
in
nineteen
thirty-five
yours
is
the
case
where
congress
would
have
never
dreamt
they
had
jurisdiction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
very
surprised
that
ferc
is
saying
that
they
have
no
jurisdiction
over
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
b
puts
something
up
on
those
lines
that
blocks
the
transmission,
i'm
very
surprised
that
ferc
would
say
they
don't
have
jurisdiction
to
stop...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
what
this
case
is
about
in
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thought
you
wanted
the
particular
reg
there's
a
particular
reg
that
new
york
has
been
talking
about,
and
i
thought
you
wanted
that
applied
to
the
,
a-
bundled
sales
as
well.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
and
and
and
that
seems
to
me
a
different
issue
than
somebody
climbing
up
a
pole,
for
example,
and
cutting
the
wire
so
that
you
can't
get
your
electricity
between
state
a
and
state...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
even
see
how
this
works.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
position
of
the
government
is,
in
respect
to
enron's
case,
not
new
york's,
enron
is
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
your
position
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
want
to
know
what
i
i
have
an
argument
in
some
briefs
made
by
enron
,
and
perhaps
i
misread
them
and
i'll
go
back
to
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
i
answer
this
question
from
your
question
presented?
number
two,
in
oh
oh
eight
oh
nine,
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
properly
deferred
to
the
commission's
determination
that
it
lacks
jurisdiction
over
retail
transmission
service
that
is
sold
together
with
electric
energy
in
a
single
bundled
transaction,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
mr.
cohen
put
the
example
that
he
did
of
a
grid,
and
the
grid
covers
several
states,
and
there
are
many
sales
for
wholesales
between
sales
for
resale
between
a
and
c
and
d
and
f,
but
there's
one
in
the
middle,
c,
where
it
in
fact
is
all
bundled.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
and
if
in
fact
they
are
scheduling
deliveries,
the
state
commission,
in
that
c
so
that
the
wrong
people
are
getting
the
energy
and
so
that
the
wholesales
the
sales
for
resale
in
a,
e,
and
f
are
all
mucked
up,
the
answer
is,
of
course,
the
commission
has
jurisdiction...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thing
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
over,
in
your
opinion,
is
to
make
this
kind
of
nondiscriminatory
order
applicable
in
our
middle
state
c
where
the
transactions
are
all
run
from
generating
to
distribution
to
transmission,
everything
is
run
by
one
company,
p
g
and
e.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i
interpret
it,
in
a
sentence
is
if
we
go
back
to
nineteen
thirty-five,
even
if
the
new
york
situation
was
something
they
never
would
have
dreamt
of,
the
enron
situation
is
something
that
they
certainly
did
dream
of.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
covering
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
right?
don't
say
i'm
right
if
i'm
not.
