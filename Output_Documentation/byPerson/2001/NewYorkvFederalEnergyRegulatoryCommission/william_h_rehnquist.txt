power
marketing
versus
the
federal
energy
commission.
the
two
cases
were
consolidated
for
argument.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
upholding
an
order
of
the
commission
that
primarily
focused
on
the
wholesale
electricity
market.
three
aspects
of
the
order
are
relevant
to
our
review:
first,
ferc
ordered
functional
unbundling
of
wholesale
energy
sales
which
means
that
utilities
must
state
separate
rates
for
energy
transmission
and
other
services
provided,
and
must
accept
transmission
of
their
own
wholesale
sales
at
the
same
rate
that
others
are
charged.
the
parties
do
not
dispute
the
validity
of
this
part
of
the
order.
second,
ferc
imposed
a
similar
open
access
requirement
on
unbundled
retail
sales
in
interstate
commerce.
new
york
challenges
this
part
of
the
order
in
case
no.
00-568.
third,
ferc
declined
to
extend
the
open
access
requirement
to
the
transmission
component
of
retail
sales
that
remained
bundled
under
state
law
concluding
that
unbundling
such
transmissions
was
unnecessary
to
remedy
the
discrimination
in
the
wholesale
market
that
ferc
had
found.
enron
challenges
this
portion
of
the
order
in
case
no.
00-809.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
stevens,
we
reject
both
these
challenges
to
ferc’s
order
and
affirm
the
decision
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
with
respect
to
new
york’s
claim
that
ferc’s
exercise
of
jurisdiction
exceeded
the
bounds
of
the
federal
power
act,
new
york
argues
that
retail
electricity
transactions
are
subject
only
to
state
regulation.
however,
section
201(b)
of
the
act
gives
ferc
jurisdiction
over
their
transmission
of
electric
energy
and
interstate
commerce,
and
the
unbundled
transmission
that
ferc
has
decided
to
regulate
fall
within
the
plain
meaning
of
that
section
in
light
of
the
interconnected
nature
of
the
national
grid
for
electricity
nowadays.
no
statutory
language
limits
ferc’s
transmission
jurisdiction
to
the
wholesale
market
and
in
the
absence
of
such
language,
new
york’s
argument
that
the
statute
draws
a
bright
line
between
retail
and
wholesale
transmission
is
unpersuasive.
with
respect
to
enron’s
challenge
to
ferc’s
decision
not
to
regulate
bundled
retail
transmissions,
we
conclude
that
ferc’s
decision
was
a
statutorally
permissible
one.
ferc
did
not
hold
itself
powerless
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
bundled
retail
transmissions
as
enron
alleges.
instead
it
reasonably
decided
not
to
assert
such
jurisdiction
in
the
present
proceedings
for
two
reasons:
first,
it
is
said
that
such
measures
were
unnecessary
to
remedy
the
discrimination
in
the
wholesale
market
that
it
found;
second,
it
is
said
that
to
do
so
would
raise
complicated
jurisdictional
questions.
the
portions
of
our
opinion
discussing
the
new
york
case
are
unanimous.
with
respect
to
the
enron
case,
justice
thomas
joined
by
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
