mr.
louis
r.
cohen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
it
said
that
the
transmissions
should
not
be
considered
within
the
interstate
transmission
clause
giving
ferc
jurisdiction
over
interstate
transmissions,
but
rather,
in
the
case
of
transmissions
bundled
with
retail
sales,
should
be
considered
part
of
the
bundled
retail
sale.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
called
it
a
permissible
policy
choice,
and
but...
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
ferc
made
a
jurisdictional
mistake
and
i
think
the
dc
circuit...
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
solve
the
problem
that
it
foun-
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
what
it
must
do
under
section
two
oh
six,
which
is
section
eight
twenty-four
e,
is
cure
the
undue
discrimination
that
it
found.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i'm
hoping
that
what
i
had
was
a
pyrrhic
defeat
in
the
in
the
in
the
dc
circuit
and
that
and
that
ferc,
once
told
that
it
has
jurisdiction,
and
having
recognized
that
it
has
the
obligation
to
cure
undue
discrimination,
will
exercise
that
jurisdiction
properly.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
actually
in
the
louisiana
power
and
light
case,
which
we
cite
a-
and
think
is
very
much
in
point
here,
which
arises
under
the
same
parallel
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act,
ferc's
initial
position
was
that
it
i
believe
ferc's
initial
position
was
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
regulate
bundled
direct
retail
sales
of
o-
o-
of
gas
and
that
that
included
u-
u-
a
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
transportation
of
that
gas.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
what
happened
in
nineteen
thirty-five
was
that,
recognizing
that
interconnection
was
coming,
congress
granted
ferc
jurisdiction
over
transportation
of
electric
energy
in
interstate
commerce
without
limitation.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
states
have
plenary
power
to
regulate
who
may
serve
their
retail
customers
and
at
what
rates
and
at
what
and
on
what
other
terms
and
conditions.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
determine
the
the
cost
of
transmission
of
electricity
insofar
as
that
and
and
and
and
that
may
be
one
of
the
costs
that
the
retail
utility
i-
incurs
for
which
the
retail
utility
has
the
right
under
state
law
to
recover.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
it's
eight
twenty-four...
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
that's...
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
and
we
have
stressed
whereas
the
s-
the
the
the
nine
states
have
tried
to
blur
this
distinction,
we
have
stressed
the
distinction
between
ferc's
jurisdiction
over
transmission
and
ferc's
jurisdiction
over
wholesale
sales.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
is
i-
i-
is,
n-
does
not
encroach
upon
the
states'
retail
sale
authority,
but
it
is
something
that
the
states
must
respect
in
setting
retail
rates,
so
ferc's
regulation
of
the
cost
of
transmission.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
that
is
that
is
the
statutory...
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
basic
structure
of
our
argument
is
that
just
as
your
opinion
for
the
court,
justice
o'connor,
explained
in
nantahala,
that
m-
the
states
must
take
into
account
the
wholesale
cost
of
energy,
so
the
states
can
be
required
to
to
take
into
account
ferc's
regulation
of
transmission...
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
we
don't
think
it
should
make
any
because
transmissions
,
whether
for
wholesale
or
retail,
whether
bundled
or
unbundled,
compete
for
use
of
the
interstate
grid.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
absolutely
not.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
because
what
we
want
the
right
to
do
is
to
use
the
transmission
system
through
those
states
without
the
retail
the
traditional
monopoly
utility
that
owns
the
facilities
in
those
states
being
able
to
hog
those
facilities
for
its
own
use
and
keep
us
off
the
road.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
even
though
we're
not
trying
to
reach
retail
customers,
we
may
be
trying
to
sell
e-
energy
to
the
utility
in
minneso-
in
in
in
in
in
wisconsin.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
wholesale
sale
can
be
regulated,
but
the
traditional
utility
in
minnesota,
which
owns
the
facilities
and
mostly
makes
bundled
retail
sales
to
its
customers
in
minnesota,
can
say,
our
bundled
retail
sales
are
not
subject
to
ferc's
oatt.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
little
surprised
too.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
from
our
s-
from
our
standpoint,
that's
what
our
side
of
this
case
is
about.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
all
that
i'm
asking
the
court
to
say
is
that
ferc
has
the
ability
to
a-,
the
jurisdiction
to
apply
its
general
open
access
transmission
tariff
not
only
to
our
sales
a-
f-
at
wholesale
and
to
s-
but
but
also
to
the
bundled
retail
sales
that
compete
with
us
for
use
of
the
o-
of
the
transmission
grids.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
justice
kennedy,
the
the
answer
to
that
i-
is,
first
of
all,
that
it's
it's
not
just
blockage.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
e-
particular
regulation.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
ideal
example
is
the
curtailment
example.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
to
regulate
the
transmission
of
electric
energy
in
interstate
commerce,
and
that
has
become
a
more
complicated
problem
than
it
was
in
nineten
thirty-five.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
on
average
it's
now
about
it's
now
about
ten
percent.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
it
is.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
in
order
to
have
the
the
the
electricity
flows...
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
but
in
order
to
have
the
right
to
turn
on,
to
ramp
up
your
generator
to
to
produce
some
additional
electricity
which
your
customer
a-
a-
a-
at
a
time
when
your
customer
is
going
to
take
electricity
off
the
system
at
some
other
point,
y-
you
need
to
have
a
contractual
arrangement
or
other
right
to
do
that.
