justice

o'connor
were
no
statute
at
all?
and
,
do
you
think
that
under
the
commerce
clause,
with
today's
multi-state
grids
for
transmission
of
power,
that
the
states
could
have
directly
regulated
energy
transmission
as
a
separate
service?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
didn't
have
these
interstate
grids,
and
isn't
it
conceivable
that
you
could
have
a
power
company
producing
power
within
a
state
and
distributing
it
to
customers
within
the
state,
everything
totally
intrastate?
that
may
have
been
a
common
occurrence
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
says,
shall
apply
to
transmission
of
electric
energy
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
sale
of
electric
energy
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce,
which
you
take
to
be
a
second
grant
of
authority.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
transmission
component
is
bundled
or
unbundled
at
retail
sale?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
know
about
you,
but
when
i
look
at
my
utility
rate,
it's
a
very
small
amount
for
transmission
and
a
substantially
larger
amount
for
the
energy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
has
determined,
after
a
hearing,
that
there
is
discrimination
going
on
in
the
allocation
of
transmission
services,
must
it
then
order
a
remedy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
are
there
still
some
intrastate
electric
producers
that
also
transmit
their
energy
totally
within
the
state
and
ferc
has
no
jurisdiction
over...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
are
some
that
are
not
connected...
