justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand.
i
mean
i
buy
at
the
video
store
three
films,
traffic,
lolita,
and
titanic.
each
film
has
a
scene
of
simulated
sexual
behavior
by
17-year-olds,
all
right?
i
think
that
was
the
question.
the
question
is,
why
am
i
not
guilty
under
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
of
a
federal
crime
for
possessing
those
three
films?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
your
answer
to
the
question
if
this
afternoon
i
go
out,
go
to
the
video
store,
buy
the
three
films
and
bring
them
home
is,
yes,
i
am
guilty
of
a
federal
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
mean
you
can't
prove
scienter?
it
says
that
it
is
a
crime
to
buy,
to
possess
a
film
that
has
simulated
sexual
activity
by
persons
who
appear
to
be
under
the
age
of
18.
well,
i
would
tell
you
right
now,
i
think
that
film
did
contain
simulated
sexual
activity
by
persons
who
appeared
to
be
under
the
age
of
18.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
it
was
real
activity,
i
think
it
was
simulated,
and
i
think
they
did
appear
to
me
to
be
under
the
age
of
18.
so
am
i
guilty
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
were
pretty
good
actually.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
that
the
question
i
really
would
like
you
to
get
to
if
you
can
is
one
that's
really
bothering
me
very
much
is
the
question
that
justice
scalia
asked
and
the
thing
in
this
area
i
do
not
understand,
in
the
entire
area
is
why
doesn't
miller
work?
there
is
obviously
a
set
of
materials
which
justice
stewart
used
to
refer
to
as
i
know
it
when
i
see
it
and
that
material
does
not
have
at
its
object
communication.
it
has
at
its
object
a
certain
activity
which
is
not
communication.
now
that's
all
over
our
society,
and
why,
given
this
court's
decision
in
miller,
is
that
so?
and
if
i
knew
the
answer
to
that
question
i
would
be
better
able
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
rather
not
hear
why
it's
directly...
not
directly
relevant
because
my
question,
which
is
my
own
problem,
not
your
problem,
is
i'm
trying
to
understand
the
area.
there
are
several
cases
in
this
area
coming
up,
this
is
not
the
only
one,
and
i
want
to
know
from
the
government
why
it
is,
you've
read
in
this
area,
maybe
you
just
should
direct
me
to
an
article.
the
problem
i
personally
am
having
as
a
judge
is
i
think
what
justice
scalia
was
driving
at,
maybe,
that's
his
question,
is
why
doesn't
miller
work.
now
maybe
you'll
tell
me
that
it
does,
but
that's
contrary
to
my
experience
because
it
seems
to
me
i
see
much
material
that
would
have
flunked
justice
stewart's
test
all
over
the
place.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
material
that
parents
are
worried
about
their
children
getting
a
hold
of.
now,
if
i
knew
why
miller
was
insufficient
to
deal
with
that
problem
i
would
know
better
how
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
a
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
very
well,
how
should
it
be
read?
how
would
you
write
the
statute
so
that
it
did
take
justice
stewart's
material
that
flunks.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
apparently
that
doesn't
work
and
that's
why
i'm
puzzled.
and
where
children,
where
you're
depicting
children
engaged
in
this
activity,
let's
say
that
flunks
the
algerian
seaman
test
or
whatever
it
was
he
used
to
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
congress
to
write
a
statute
in
the
area
of
children
that
gets
at
that
problem,
which
is
a
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they're
their
strongest
argument
is...
i
mean,
i
thought
their
argument
is
you're
right,
those
things
you're
talking
about
are
not
covered.
they're
not
covered
today
because
everybody
knows
they're
not
really
under
the
age
of
18,
the
actors.
and
tomorrow
if
we
have
a
new
system
we'll
worry
about
it
tomorrow
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
maybe
all
they'd
have
to
do
is
put
on
the
top
these
are
not
real,
i
don't
know
what
they'd
have
to
do,
but
they're
so
few
and
far
between
that
we
shouldn't
strike
the
statute
down
on
its
face.
now
that's
why
i
think
people
are
asking
you
for
particular
examples
because
if
you
have
to
make
up
an
imaginary
example
that
doesn't
really
exist
then
maybe
the
correct
thing
to
do
is
say
the
statute
shouldn't
be
struck
down
on
its
face
and
we'll
proceed
case
by
case
as
a
reasonable
literary
or
scientific
virtue
to
a
particular
thing.
of
course
the
person
can't
be
convicted.
now
that's
case
by
case.
i'm
putting
what
i
take
it
is
their
argument
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
other
argument
which
is
look,
we're
trying
to
protect
the
real
children
who
are
the
subjects
of
the
film
and
the
reason
we
need
this
to
protect
them
is
because
there
is
no
way
for
any
expert
or
anyone
else
to
say
when
they
see
a
film
whether
this
is
a
film
of
a
real
person
or
whether
it
is
a
fake
film
made
through
virtual
technology.
the
experts
just
can't
tell
us.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
true?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you
think
it
is
not
true,
they
think
it
is
true.
is
there
somewhere
in
the
record
i
could
look
or
some
place
i
could
find
out
as
to
what
experts
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
but
your
point
still
is,
i
take
it
is,
even
if
in
fact
the
congress
is
correct
on
that,
there's
no
evidence
that
cases
are
being
lost
because
of
this
virtual
indistinguishability
problem,
cases
involving
real
children.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
worrying
me
about
what
you're
saying
now
is
that
if
their
factual
hypothesis
is
true,
which
i
tend
to
doubt,
but
i'm
not
an
expert,
that
there
is
no
technical
way
to
distinguish
between
a
photograph
of
a
real
child
and
an
imaginary
child,
if
it
were
true,
there
is
no
expert
who
could
tell
you
the
difference
and
you
tell
me
i
can
not
have
an
affirmative
defense,
then
the
government
cannot
prosecute
real
child
pornography.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
there
would
be
no
way
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
it
was
a
real
child.
so
if
you
deny
the
government
the
possibility
of
the
affirmative
defense
weapon
you
are
denying
them
the
possibility
of
prosecuting
real
child
pornography.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
presumably
people
think
that
it
is
possible
to
distinguish
between
the
real
child
and
the
virtual
fake.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
what
you're
doing
is
in
effect
varying
the
question,
you're
saying,
look,
in
the
real
world
it
doesn't
happen,
they
can
tell.
but
if
you
assume
the
hypothesis
that
justice
breyer
started
with,
the
factual
hypothesis
that
if
these
are
well
enough
made
you
can't
tell
the
difference,
then
doesn't
it
follow
that
if
you
rule
out
the
affirmative
defense
route
for
the
government,
the
government
simply
won't
be
able
to
prove
the
case
in
the
instances
in
which
real
children
are
being
used.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
said...
suppose
you
said...
suppose
i...
i
don't
know
how
i'd
do
it,
suppose
i
could
draft
a
statute
which
had
a
medical
research
exemption.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
took...
i
just
want
to
follow
up
on
what
justice
kennedy
said.
suppose
you
took
miller
and
said
where
you
have
clearly
minors
we
as
a
matter
of
law
assume
that
it's
patently
offensive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
could
be
done,
you'd
still
have
the
other
two
parts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wonder
if
miller
would
work
more
satisfactorily
if
you
did
that
in
the
case
of
people
who
clearly
appear
to
be
minors.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
it
would.
