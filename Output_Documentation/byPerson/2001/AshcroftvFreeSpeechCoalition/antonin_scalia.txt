mr.
clement,
i'm
not
sure
what
simulated
sexual
activity
consists
of.
i
didn't
see
any
of
these
movies.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
one
described
in
the
briefs
supposedly
was
the
shot
of
a
juvenile,
whether
played
by
a
juvenile
or
not,
from
the
waist
up
supposedly
engaged
in
sexual
activity.
would
you
consider
that
to
be
covered
by
the
statute
as
sexually
explicit
conduct?
i
mean
what
if
it
was
just
the
hand?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think,
i
mean
the
definition
of
sexually
explicit
conduct
is
and
what
the
statute
prohibits
is
this
conduct
by
minors
under
17
or
younger,
sexual
intercourse,
engaging
in
sexual
intercourse,
bestiality,
masturbation,
sadistic
or
masochistic
abuse
or
lascivious
exhibition
of
the
genitals
or
pubic
area.
now,
the
government
has
not
made
the
argument
that
at
least
as
applied
to
juveniles
this
is
unprotected
speech
anyway
and
consists
of
obscenity
which
a
state
or
federal
government
is
free,
if
it
wishes,
to
prohibit?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
such
as
what?
such
as
what?
you
know,
i
try
to
think
what
great
works
of
art
would
be
taken
away
from
us
if
we
were
unable
to
show
minors
copulating
or
any
of
the
other
acts
set
forth
in
the
definition
here.
can
you
give
me
a
couple
of
examples?
justice
antonin
scalia
lolita?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
a
great...
leaving
the
book,
the
movie
lolita,
the
book
is
perfectly
okay,
right?
this
only
applies
to
the
movie?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
great
work
of
western
art.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
else
besides
the
movie
lolita
would
we
be
deprived
of
in
order
to
prevent
little
children
from
being
exploited?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
respect,
this
is
not,
you
know,
the
mona
lisa
or
venus
de
milo
or
anything
that
has
lasted
more
than
30
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
you've
seen
a
different
version
of
that
play
than
i
have.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
the
statute
can
reasonably
be
read
giving
the
definition
of
the
activities
covered
not
to
cover
two
people
under
a
bed
with
no
depiction
of
sexual
organs
or
anything
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
sexual
activity.
if
it's
just
a
depiction
without
any
indication
of
the
sexual
organs
it's
certainly
reasonable
to
say
that
that
isn't
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
the
congressional
finding
is
wrong
then
because
the
statute
begins
with,
among
other
findings,
new
photographic
and
computer
imaging
technologies
make
it
possible
to
produce
by
electronic,
mechanical
or
other
means
visual
depictions
of
what
appear
to
be
children
engaging
in
sexually
explicit
conduct
that
are
virtually
indistinguishable
to
the
unsuspecting
viewer
from
unretouched
photographic
images.
you
say
that
that
congressional
finding
is
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
both
your
opponent
and
the
congress
who
think
you're
wrong
on
this
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clement
gave
an
example
of
another
case
in
which
the
government
did
obtain
a
conviction
but
only
because
of
the
new
statute
in
which
the
government
witness
was
unable
to
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
was
just
a
bad
government
witness,
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
have
gotten
a
conviction
if
the
law
had
been
what
you
want
it
to
be,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
on
that
basis
can
you
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
it
was
a
depiction
of
an
actual
minor.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
how
would
that
affirmative
defense
prevent
some
of
the
evils
that
the
government
is
trying
to
prevent,
for
example
the
seduction
of
minors
to
sexual
conduct
by
showing
things
that
appear
to
be
minors?
how
would
this,
affirm...
the
existence
of
this
affirmative
defense
still
enable
the
government
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
want
to
talk
about
a
very
small
portion
of
the
population
i
would
think
there's
a
very
small
portion
of
the
population
that
wants
either
to
produce
or
to
watch
adolescents
and
children
engaging
in
sexual
conduct
of
the
sort
described
in
this
statute.
you're
dealing
with
a
small
portion
of
the
population
to
begin
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
can
distinguish
attraction
to
other
forms
of
socially
damaging
behavior
from
that
particular
category
of
social...
socially
damaging
behavior
that
has
for
hundreds
of
years
been
treated
as
obscenity.
i
don't
think
there's
any
risk
of
the
court
suddenly
declaring
that
excessive
violence
constituted
obscenity.
we
know
what
obscenity
is.
there
have
been
laws
against
this
particularly
infectious
kind
of
solicitation
to
conduct
for
centuries.
i
don't
know
why
you
think
we're
going
to
suddenly
flop
over
into
prohibiting
the
godfather
because
that
also
portrays
socially
undesirable
conduct.
justice
antonin
scalia
sexual
material
in
a
category
called
obscenity
which
has
traditionally
for
hundreds
of
years
been
regulable
by
government.
