but
that's
not
an
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
basically
we're
talking
here
about
overbreadth
and
the
government's
argument
seems
to
be
that
since
there
is
a
class
of
materials
that
we
can
proscribe,
the
fact
that
it's
overly
broad
is
the
respondent's
problem.
but
the
law
works
the
other
way
around,
you
have
to
show
that
this
statute
is
precise
as
to
its
coverage
and
that
it
covers
no
more
and
let's
just
for
argument's
sake,
although
i
don't
think
that's
the
law,
concede
not
substantially
more
than
what
can
be
prohibited.
and
justice
o'connor's
question
was
directed
to
this
latter
problem
and
it
seems
to
me
you're
not
answering
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
gravamen
of
her
question,
justice
o'connor
can
explain
her
own
question,
but
as
i
understood
it,
is
that
there's
a
substantial
area
here
where
adults
who
are
play
acting
roles
of
children
are
covered,
and
the
question
is
what
is
the
government's
interest
in
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
statute
does
say
explicit.
doesn't
that
cover
what
justice
scalia--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
say
explicit.
what
work
does
the
term
explicit
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
if
real
children
are
not
used
in
the
depiction
of
simulated
sexual
activity
that
it
cannot
be
barred
unless
it
meets
the
miller
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
eight
year
olds,
ten
year
olds,
twelve
year
olds.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
constitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
precedent
that
we
judge
a
free
speech
statute
based
on
the
kind
of
prosecutions
the
government
has
been
bringing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
considers
whether
certain
provisions
of
the
child
pornography
prevention
act
of
1996,
a
federal
statute,
abridged
the
freedom
of
speech.
as
a
general
rule,
pornography
can
be
prohibited
only
if
it
is
obscene
but
an
exception
to
the
rule
exists
for
pornography
is
produced
using
children.
the
act
here
extends
the
federal
ban
on
child
pornography
to
what
is
called
virtual
child
pornography.
these
are
images
that
appear
to
depict
minors
but
were
not
produced
using
any
real
children.
by
its
literal
term,
the
definition
covers
a
renaissance
painting
depicting
a
scene
from
classical
mythology
or
a
hollywood
movie
films
without
child
actors
if
the
adults
depicted
appear
to
be
minors
engaging
in
simulated
sexual
intercourse.
the
respondents
are
makers
of
adult
films
and
graphic
artists
who
fear
that
their
works
which
do
not
use
real
children
might
be
prohibited
by
the
act’s
expanded
definition
of
child
pornography.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
act
was
overbroad
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
in
those
relevant
provisions
that
we
consider
here
and
we
now
affirm.
the
sexual
abuse
of
a
child
is
a
most
serious
crime
and
an
act
repugnant
to
the
moral
instincts
of
any
decent
people.
and
congress
within
its
proper
jurisdiction
may
pass
valid
laws
to
protect
children
from
abuse
and
of
course
it
has.
the
prospect
of
crime,
however,
does
not
by
itself
justify
laws
suppressing
speech.
as
a
general
principle,
the
first
amendment
bars
the
government
from
dictating
what
we
see
or
read
or
speak
or
hear.
the
act’s
penalties
are
severe.
a
first
offender
may
be
imprisoned
for
15
years;
a
repeat
offender
faces
a
sentence
of
not
less
than
5
years
and
not
more
than
30
years.
while
even
minor
punishments
can
show
speech,
this
case
provides
a
textbook
example
of
why
we
permit
facial
challenges
to
statutes
that
burden
expression.
with
these
severe
penalties
enforced,
few
movie
producers
or
book
publishers
would
risk
distributing
images
in
or
near
the
uncertain
reach
of
this
law.
freedom
of
speech
does
have
its
limits;
it
does
not
embrace
certain
categories
of
speech
including
defamation
incitement,
obscenity,
and
pornography
produced
with
real
children.
while
these
categories
may
be
prohibited
without
violating
the
first
amendment,
this
act
goes
beyond
these
existing
categories.
the
act
covers
more
than
obscenity
because
as
we
have
noted,
it
extends
to
works
that
need
not
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
or
offend
community
standards
and
importantly
may
have
artistic
and
literary
value.
the
apparent
age
of
persons
depicted
may
be
relevant
to
whether
an
image
offends
community
standards.
pictures
of
young
children
engaged
in
certain
acts
might
be
obscene
where
similar
depiction
of
adults
are
perhaps
even
older
adolescence
would
not.
on
the
other
hand,
pictures
that
appear
to
be
17
year
olds
engaging
in
sexually
explicit
activity
do
not
in
every
case
contravene
community
standards.
the
statute
proscribe
the
visual
depiction
of
an
idea
that
of
teenagers
engaging
in
sexual
activity
that
is
a
fact
of
modern
society
and
it
has
been
an
artistic
theme
from
romeo
and
juliet
to
the
contemporary
films
of
american
beauty
and
traffic.
the
act
also
goes
beyond
the
ban
on
child
pornography
because
it
targets
the
contents
of
the
image
rather
than
the
circumstances
of
production.
the
government
points
out
that
the
act
was
not
a
complete
ban
because
it
has
an
affirmative
defense
that
protects
some
defendants
who
prove
that
the
images
do
not
use
real
children.
imposing
on
the
defendant
the
burden
of
proving
a
speech
is
not
unlawful,
however,
it
raises
serious
constitutional
difficulties
and
here
the
defense
is
fatally
incomplete
in
any
event
because
persons
charged
with
possessing
as
opposed
to
distributing
virtual
image
have
no
affirmative
defense.
for
this
reason,
the
affirmative
defense
could
not
save
the
statutory
provisions.
respondents
also
have
challenged
a
separate
provision
which
prohibits
images
whose
context
conveys
the
impression
that
they
are
child
pornography,
although
the
provision
is
aimed
at
preventing
the
pondering
of
images
as
child
pornography,
we
hold
that
it
is
overbroad
and
it
makes
the
possession
of
those
images
a
crime
even
where
the
defendant
bears
no
responsibility
for
the
unlawful
context.
these
are
the
reasons
we
relied
upon
for
our
determination
that
the
children’s
provisions
of
the
act
are
invalid.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
o’connor
