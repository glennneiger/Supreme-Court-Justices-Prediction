mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1996
congress
updated
the
child
pornography
laws
to
keep
pace
with
technological
developments.
congress
extended
the
existing
prohibitions
on
visual
depictions
of
actual
children
engaged
in
sexually
explicit
conduct
to
cover
virtually
indistinguishable
images
in
material
pandered
as
child
pornography.
these
provisions
are
constitutional
for
the
same
basic
reason
that
other
laws
prohibiting
child
pornography
have
been
upheld.
they
protect
real
children
from
real
abuse.
they
do
so
in
two
important
ways.
first,
by
preventing
the
publication
and
production
of
materials
that
are
as
effective
as
traditional
child
pornography
in
seducing
children,
and
second,
by
allowing
the
government
to
effectively
prosecute
cases
involving
traditional
forms
of
child
pornography.
first,
these
provisions
allow
the
government
to
attack
material
that
poses
the
same
risk
of
enticing
children
into
illicit
sexual
activities
and
to
pose
for
child
pornography
as
traditional
child
pornography.
the
government
has
a
clear
and
compelling
interest
in
targeting
such
material;
indeed,
this
court
in
osborne
against
ohio
used
that
rationale
to
uphold
ohio's
prohibition
on
the
possession
of
child
pornography.
second
and
equally
important,
the
government
has
a
clear
interest
in
promoting
the
effective
prosecution
of
the
traditional
laws
against
traditional
forms
of
child
pornography.
the
advent
and
increasing
availability
of
computer
technology
has
allowed
individuals
to
generate
computer
images
that
are
virtually
indistinguishable
from
traditional
photographs.
this
allows
criminal
defendants
to
inject
reasonable
doubt
arguments
into
virtually
every
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no
case
has
been
lost
on
that
ground
but
that
is
largely
a
result
of
the
1996
act,
which
has
taken
that
argument
away
from
criminal
defendants.
and
to
give
you
one
very
specific
example,
the
case
that
the
fifth
circuit
heard
in
the
fox
case,
united
states
against
fox
which
is
one
of
the
cases
where
the
lower
courts
upheld
this
law
in
an
as
applied
context,
the
government's
expert
witness,
special
agent
barkhausen
was
forced
on
cross-examination
to
admit
that
she
could
not
tell
definitively
whether
or
not
the
image
was
of
a
real
child.
now
that
concession
prior
to
the
1996
act
would
likely
have
been
fatal
to
the
government's
prosecution.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
case
was
because
she
couldn't
tell
it
was
a
real
person.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
in
the
cases
where
the
line
that
the
courts
are
concerned
with
is
the
line
between
18
and
19,
there's
an
additional
aspect
of
the
statute
that
clears
up
many
of
the
problems
and
that's
the
affirmative
defense
which
allows
individuals
to
produce
and
distribute
materials
if
they
make
clear
they
involve
actual
individuals
who
are
over
18.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
certainly
true,
but
i
think
congress
in
recognizing
an
affirmative
defense
for
materials
that
were
produced
using
people
who
had
reached
the
age
of
majority
struck
a
balance
and
recognized
that
this
court
has
provided
additional
protection
to
pornographic
depictions
involving
actual
adults.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
for
that
differential
treatment.
one
is
with
respect
to
age
that's
a
fact
that's
uniquely
verifiable
and
in
a
lot
of
contexts
we
recognize
that
somebody's
age
is
something
that
one
can
verify.
and
in
fact
what
we're
really
talking
about
in
most
of
these
cases
where
the
affirmative
defense
for
age
would
be
implicated
are
films
and
the
like
where
there
would
be
witnesses
who
could
testify
that
somebody
was
of
a
particular
age
on
a
particular
date.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
in
most
of
the
cases
when
you're
talking
about
somebody
who's
going
to
make
the
claim
that
they
actually
generated
the
photographs
themselves,
there
will
be
no
witnesses.
but
i
think
more
important
than
the
presence
or
absence
of
witnesses
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
i
do
think
that
age
rather
than
whether
an
image
is
computerally
generated
is
something
that
is
uniquely
subject
to
verification
and
this
court
in
its
ferber
decision
confronted
the
argument
that
the
new
york
statute
was
overbroad
because
it
didn't
limit
its
protections
to
photographs
and
images
that
were
produced
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
the
court
rejected
that
overbreadth
argument
for
two
reasons;
one,
that
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
for
anybody
to
prove
what
was
the
state
of
origin
for
the
photo.
and
i
think
the
same
analysis
applies
for
a
computer
generated
image.
the
second
reason,
of
course,
was
that
even
materials--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--because,
again,
in
sort
of
the
stylized
case
that
the
person
who's
computer
generated
an
image,
that's
not
something
that
requires
a
film
crew
to
be
brought
in
so
there
aren't
necessarily
going
to
be
witnesses.
in
the
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i'm
not
sure
it's
absolutely
unique
but
i
do
think
age
is
uniquely
subject
to
verification.
and
if
i
could
get
to
the
second
reason
that
this
court
pointed
out
in
ferber
why
you
didn't
need
to
have
a
limitation
just
to
pictures
generated
in
the
state
of
new
york,
the
court
recognized
in
footnote
19
that
those
materials,
even
if
produced
outside
the
state
of
new
york,
pose
harms
and
potential
risk
to
children
inside
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right
as
a
matter
of
the
statute.
there's
no
express
affirmative
defense
for
possession.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
believe
that's
true.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
did
see
it.
[laughter]
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there's
no
affirmative
defense
for
possession
but
i
think
what
the
statute
does
is
it
effectively
makes
it
so
that
in
virtually,
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
where
the
producers
and
distributors
of
a
film
will
be
able
to
claim
the
affirmative
defense,
the
individual
possessor
will
be
able
to
claim
the
affirmative
defense
because
of
a
failure
of
the
government's
ability
to
prove
scienter,
because
if
you
think
about
the
affirmative
defense
it
gives
people
the
ability
to
distribute
a
movie
if
it
involves
actors.
but
if
they
have
the
right
to
distribute
a
movie
that
nobody
can
lawfully
possess,
it
doesn't
give
them
much,
that's
not
much
comfort
to
them.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there's
two
reasons.
one
is
precisely
in
order
to
deal
with
this
anomaly
that
they
don't
want
to
be
producing
a
film
that
nobody
can
lawfully
possess,
the
affirmative
defense
gives
an
incentive
to
producers
and
distributors
to
make
it
clear
in
the
marketing
of
the
material
that
those
scenes
that
you're
talking
about
were
scenes
that
were
produced
using
adults
or
scenes
used
with
body
doubles,
and
so
in
that
sense
through
the
marketing
of
the
material
they
can
make
it
clear
to
people
that
it
involved
adults.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
exactly.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there
is
a
requirement,
though,
that
the
government
prove
scienter
with
respect
to
age
in
any
prosecution
for
possession
and
i
don't
see
how
the
government
could
prove
scienter
as
to
age
in
the
case
of
these
films
where
they're
marketed
in
a
way
where
it's
clear
that
they
involve
adult
actors.
there's
a
second
aspect
in
which
this
court
could
find
the
affirmative
defense
to
cover
individuals
and
that...
individual
possessors,
and
that
is
the
statute
does
give
an
affirmative
defense
for
receipt
and
as
the
government
argued
in
its
briefs
that
naturally
would
cover
possession
incident
to
receipt.
what
it
doesn't
cover,
though,
and
why
i
think
congress
didn't
have
a
blanket
affirmative
defense
for
possession
is
it
doesn't
apply
to
somebody
who
receives
some
material
that's
marketed
in
a
way
or
has
a
disclaimer
that
makes
it
clear
that
it
involves
adult
actors,
but
then
the
individual
somehow
modifies
it,
strips
out
the
disclaimer.
in
that
case,
the
possession
is
covered
by
the
statute
and
i
think
rightly
so.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it
would
trouble
me
if
the
statute
had
that
effect
but
it
doesn't
have
that
effect.
the
affirmative
defense
makes
it
crystal
clear.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
thought
you
said
18.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
it's
17,
but
in
any
event
it
doesn't
trouble
me
if
it's
a
17-year-old
is
prohibited
because
they
wouldn't
be
prohibited
from
playing
those
roles
if...
the
studio
would
have
two
options.
they
could
either
not
include
the
sexually
explicit
conduct
which
is
all
that's
covered
by
the
statute,
and
i
think
it
would
be
possible
to
have
made
the
film
traffic
without
involving
simulated
sexual
activity.
but
putting
that
to
the
side,
the
other
option
is
to
use
a
body
double
and
make
it
clear
in
the
marketing
of
the
film
that
that's
precisely
what
you've
done.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
not
at
all.
you
could
not
be
guilty
because
the
government
could
not
prove
scienter
and
because
you
would
have
lawful--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
again--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--you
are
not
guilty
for
the
two
reasons
that
i've
said
and
let
me
just
say
that
you
would
have
the
same
problem
with
respect
to
the
statute
at
issue
in
ferber.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
certainly
if
it
was
just
the
hand
and
certainly...
i
think
there
would
be
certainly
a
number
of
ways--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--to
the
contrary,
the
government
has
argued
throughout
this
case
that
it's
all
unprotected
speech
because
it's
child
pornography.
and
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
want
to
be
clear,
i
think
government
would
take
the
position
that
virtually
all
the
material
covered
by
this
statute
is
independently
obscene,
but
that's
not
how
the
government
chose
to
regulate
it.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
you
have
to
read
the
term
simulated
sexual
intercourse
in
conjunction
with
the
other
terms
in
the
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
certainly
true
but
i
think
if
you
read
the
statute
in
context,
i
think
there's
some
requirement
that
the
sexual
intercourse
that
would
be
depicted
would
require
some
display
of
nudity
in
the
process.
certainly...
well,
it
doesn't...
it
may
not
say
that
and
the
statute
itself
may
not
address
that
case.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
proper
way
to
resolve
that
case
is
in
an
as
applied
challenge.
wait
for
the
government
to
bring
that
prosecution.
in
fact,
i
think
the
government
won't
bring
that
prosecution.
i
mean,
it's
interesting
to
talk
about
the
film
version
of
lolita
and
the
like
but
that
involves
just
a
tiny
fraction
of
materials
covered
by
this
statute,
and
if
you
want
to
bet--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely,
and
that's
why
this
material
that
we're
talking
about
is
all
probably
virtually,
the
government
could
capture
it
as
obscenity
but
of
course
if
it
tried
to
do
that
it
couldn't
ban
the
possession,
and
child
pornography
was
treated
as
a
different
case
in
ferber.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely,
like
obscenity,
what
this
court
said
in
ferber
is
the
reason
the
statute
was
permissible
is
because
it
defined
a
category
of
conduct
that
could
be
proscribed
and
was
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
let
me
just
clarify
one
thing
because
the
statute
in
ferber
itself
also
covered
simulated
sexual
activity
so
all
these
line
drawing
problems
about
what,
you
know,
at
what
point
does
the
scene
in
traffic
come
under
the
coverage
of
the
statute
also
applied
in
ferber
because
it
also
captured
simulated
acts
involving
adults.
so
the
only
difference
between
the
coverage
of
this
statute
and
ferber
is
that
this
statute
does
attempt
to
prohibit
materials
that
do
not
involve
actual
individuals
but
are
virtually
indistinguishable
from--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
i
don't
think
that's
what
ferber
meant
to
say.
i
mean,
ferber,
after
all,
was
decided
in
1982.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
did,
but
it
was
decided
in
1982
before
this
technology
even
existed.
and
interestingly,
if
you
look
at
footnote
20
in
the
ferber
opinion
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
invoke
the
general
doctrine
that
you
don't
apply
cases
before
they
arise
and
you
don't
adopt
a
rationale
any
broader
than
necessary
to
decide
the
case
before
it.
and
it
just
seems
to
me--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no
i
think
you
read
it
in
the
context--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
i
think
you
treat
it
in
the
context
of
what
was
prohibited
by
the
new
york
statute
and
the
technology
that
was
available
at
the
time.
and
i
think
what's
important
here
is
any
avenues
for
speech
that
were
left
open
in
ferber
are
left
open
by
the
statute
in
conjunction
with
the
affirmative
defense.
the
only
materials
that
are
covered
by
the
statute
and
not
covered
by
ferber
are
materials
that
didn't
exist
at
the
time
of
ferber
and
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
is
entitled
to
update
the
tech...
the
pornography
and
obscenity
laws
to
deal
with
technological
developments.
the
first
federal
obscenity
statute
in
1842
didn't
cover
photographs
because
the
technology
wasn't
in
widespread
use
at
the
time.
subsequently
congress
added
photographs
to
the
cover
to
the
obscenity
statutes
because
technology
developed
and
new
problems
arose.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well
i
think
there's...
i
would
make
two
responses.
first,
i
think
this
court
has
never
strictly
limited
itself
to
the
protection
of
the
child
depicted
in
the
image
and
it
recognizes
that
legislatures
in
congress
have
an
interest
in
protecting
all
children
but
secondly--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
know
that
we
have
to
answer
that
question
in
this
case
because
we
do
have
that,
because
this
statute
enables
the
government
to
continue
to
prosecute
effectively
cases
involving
traditional
forms
of
child
pornography,
because
the
advent--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i'm
trying
to
and
i
think
that,
i
mean,
first
of
all,
even
in
an
overbreadth
challenge
the
burden
does
lie
on
the
party
challenging
the
statute
and
they
have
to
show
things
from
actual
fact
in
order
to
challenge
the
statute
and
i
don't
think
they've
carried
that
burden.
second,
this
statute
is
responsive
to
the
problem
of
protecting
both
the
children
depicted
in
the
image
and
all
children
who
can
be
seduced
or
enticed
into
this
kind
of
activity
can
be
depicted
themselves.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there
isn't
an
interest
in
those
play
acting
cases
and
that's
why
the
affirmative
defense
allows
those
to
take
place.
but
again,
the
question
is
as
you
indicated
substantial
overbreadth
and
these
questions
we're
talking
about,
about
traffic
and
the
film
version
of
lolita
really
are
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
cases
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
let
me
first
try
to
say
two
reasons
why
i
don't
think
miller
is
directly
relevant
and
if
those
aren't
responsive
to
your
questions,
maybe--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
one
reason
that
miller
is
a
difficult
case
and
doesn't...
isn't
terribly
satisfying
is
it
requires
a
case
by
case
adjudication
of
that
three-prong
test
which
i
would
say
with
deference
is
not
self-defining.
and
what
congress
decided
to
do
in
this
context
is
follow
the
lead
of
ferber
where
it
said
that
miller
wasn't
the
test
of
child
pornography
and
defined
a
much
clearer
class
of
material
that
whether
or
not
it
applies
in
miller,
whether
or
not
the
work
as
a
whole
is
implicated,
this
is
a
definable
class
of
material
that
is
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
if
you
have
concerns
about
the
miller
test
then
you
really
should
seize
upon
this
statute
and
ferber
and
the
analysis
in
osborne
as
one
way
to
deal
with
that
problem
because
here's
a
test
that
doesn't
rely
on
community
standards
or
other
difficult
considerations
to
apply
in
practice.
it
has
a
test
that
says
when
we're
talking
about
visual
depictions
only,
we're
not
talking
about
novels
here,
and
we're
talking
about
material
that
depicts
children
engaged
in
sexually
explicit
conduct
then
we
don't
have
to
look
to
the
value
of
the
work
as
a
whole.
you
can
put
all
the
shakespeare
around
these
visual
depictions
you'd
like
and
they're
still
visual
depictions
of
children
engaged
in
sexually
explicit
conduct.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
there
are
two
principal
reasons
why
you
shouldn't
be
worried
about
that
particular
slippery
slope.
one
is
this
court
already
put
one
foot
down
that
slope
in
osborne
when
it
relied
on
the
seduction
rationale
in
conjunction
with
the
concern
for
the
children
who
were
depicted.
and
in
the
same
way
this
statute
responds
both
to
harm,
potential
harm,
to
other
children
in
the
seduction
rationale
and
to
children
actually
depicted
because
as
a
matter
of
practical
reality
it's
become
very
difficult
for
the
government
to
prosecute
cases
involving
actual,
traditional
child
pornography.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
because
i
think,
as
i
indicated
before,
there
are
real
verifiability
problems
that
don't
arise
in
the
context
of
age
that
do
arise
in
computer.
the
second
reason,
though,
i
think
that
you
have
to
be
less
worried
about
the
slippery
slope
in
this
context
is
the
government
has
consistently
gone
to
the
courts
and
told
them
to
interpret
appears
to
be
to
cover
images
that
are
virtually
indistinguishable
from
traditional
child
pornography.
it
doesn't
seem
to
put
this
court
on
a
slippery
slope
to
say
that
material
that
is
virtually
indistinguishable
from
material
that's
already
been
held
to
be
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
also
will
be
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
the
virtually
indistinguishable
phrase
already
appears
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
it
just
doesn't
appear
in
the
operative
provision.
so
what
we're
asking
you
to
do
is
to
read
that
term,
appears
to
be,
in
light
of
the
legislative
finding,
where
it's
not
just
the
legislative
finding
where
it's
virtually
indistinguishable.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
absolutely
right
and
that's
the
position
we've
taken
in
all
the
lower
courts.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
actually
think
that
the
conveys
the
impression
language
could
be
given
that
meaning
but
i
think
the
conveys
the
impression
language
is
much
less
problematic
from
a
constitutional
standpoint
if
you
understand
subsection
d
of
the
statute
to
be
addressed
to
pandering
and
in
that
context
the
concerns
about
vagueness
are
much
reduced
because
you're
not
going
to
be
focused
on
just
the
image,
you're
going
to
be
focused
on
the
way
it's
marketed,
and
i
think
in
that
context
it
won't
be
difficult
to
see
whether
or
not
it
conveys
the
image.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
counsel
for
respondent
notes
the
97
percent
conviction
figure.
well,
that
reflects
a
couple
of
things.
one,
it
reflects
that
the
1996
act
has
allowed
us
to
prosecute
cases
even
where
there
is
a
reasonable
doubt
about
whether
it
is
a
virtual
image
or
not.
the
other
thing
that
the
97
percent
conviction
rate
reflects
is
that
we
are
not
out
there
prosecuting
people
who
pick
up
traffic
at
the
blockbuster.
it's
no
accident
that
the
one
court
that
considered
this
case
in
a
facial
challenge
struck
the
statute
down,
but
the
four
courts
of
appeals
that
considered
it
in
an
as
applied
challenge
upheld
the
statute.
those
cases
give
you
an
illustration
of
what
the
statute
is
really
applied
to.
the
mento
case
involved
over
100
images
of
prepubescent
children.
the
acheson
case
in
the
11th
circuit--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--there
is
precedent
and
the
best
one
i
can
think
of
is
ferber
for
waiting
until
as
applied
challenges
to
deal
with
the
fringe
cases,
the
tiny
fraction
cases.
and
i
think,
as
in
ferber,
if
you
wait
for
those
cases
to
be
brought
you'll
find
that
they
are
not
brought
in
these
cases.
another
point
i
think
worth
emphasizing
is
that
i
don't
think
given
that
this
statute
only
covers
explicit
sexual
conduct
that
there'll
be
much
medical
research
involved.
