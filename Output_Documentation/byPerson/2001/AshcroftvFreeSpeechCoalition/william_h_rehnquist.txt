chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ferber
pretty
much
said
that
child
pornography
is
of
almost
no
value,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
child
pornography
is
a
different
case
but
very
much
like
obscenity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
clement.
mr.
sirkin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
no
problem
then
with
the
statute
before
it
was
amended.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
it
do?
how
did
it
change
the
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
well,
whatever
was
going
to
be
threatened
in
the
way
of
free
expression
and
so
forth
under
the
new
act
was
simply
computer
images
of
things
that
were
already
prohibited
if
done
by
real
people?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
statute
is
construed
to
be,
say,
virtually
indistinguishable
then
i
think
cartoons
would
not
be
covered.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
seems
way
out
at
the
fringes
somewhat.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
could
cross
that
bridge
when
you
come
to
it
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
explicit
certainly
can
mean
something
different
than
clearly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
maybe
the
courts
will
define
it
so
that
it
wouldn't
cover
the
kind
of
thing
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
a
murder
statute,
you
know,
you
don't
expect
a
whole
lot
of
people
to
go
out
and
commit
murders
but
that
doesn't
mean
congress
can't
legislate
against
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
x-citement
video
we
did
something
not
too
different
from
this,
reading
in
a
requirement
that
wasn't
express
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
an
example
of
a
case
where
there
was
a
first
amendment
challenge
where
we
have
read
something
into
a
statute
that
we
might
not
necessarily
have
done.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there's
precedent
for
our
doing
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
sirkin,
mr.
clement
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
