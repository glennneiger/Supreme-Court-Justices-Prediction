justice
david
h.
souter
has
any
case,
to
your
knowledge,
been
lost
on
that
ground
in
which
that
was
a
substantial
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
well
the
question
of
the
balance
raises
the
question
of
tailoring,
and
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
was
if
it's
appropriate
to
have
the
affirmative
defense
that
the
children
or
that
the
people
depicted
were
in
fact
over
18,
why
isn't
it
equally
appropriate
to
have
an
affirmative
defense
to
the
effect
that
the
depiction
does
not
have
anyone
who
is
not
a
real
child
under
18.
in
other
words,
if
the
government's
interests
are
protected
by
the
affirmative
defense
in
the
real
child
case,
why
shouldn't
there
be
a
comparable
affirmative
defense
for
the
simulation.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
effect
you're
depending
on
the
witness
to
say
that
the
actors
here
were
in
fact
over
18.
maybe
they'll
produce
facsimiles
of
birth
certificates
or
maybe
they'll
produce
children
or
whatnot.
why
can't
you
have
the
same
evidence
to
the
effect
that
there
were
no
real
children
being
used
in
manufacturing
the
film?
you're
depending
on
witnesses
in
each
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
a
question
of
proof
and
i
suppose
that
if
the
only
person
who
steps
up
to
the
stand
and
says,
there
were
no
live
children
here,
is
the
person
who
was
accused
of
the
pornography,
that
person
may
have
something
to
worry
about
in
not
having
a
very
convincing
affirmative
defense.
but
that's
the
defendant's
problem,
not
the
government's
problem.
and
so
i
don't
think
that
answers
the
question,
why
if
the
government
is
sufficiently
protected
with
the
affirmative
defense
in
the
one
class
of
cases
it
wouldn't
be
in
the
other.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
the
government's
problem.
i
mean,
that
may
be
the
problem
of
the
person
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
to
carry
on
the
affirmative
defense
and
if
it
is
a
problem
then
the
government
is
the...
in
effect
going
to
be
the
winning
party
in
resolving
that
problem,
but
like
justice
stevens,
i
don't
see
what
is
essentially
unique
in
the
probative
process
to
acclaim
that
it
was
a
computer
generation
rather
than
a
claim
that
the
kid
shown
was
over
18.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
let's
assume
that
that
too
was
fixed.
those
two
features,
justice
ginsburg's
and
the
inclusion
of
the
possession
is
subject
to
the
defense,
would
the
statute
then
be
constitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you'd
be
making,
you
be...
are
you
saying
that
the
affirmative
defense
therefore
is,
in
effect,
has
got
to
be
constitutionally
relevant
across
the
board?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there's
no
way
to
tailor
it
by
affirmative
defense
in
effect
is
your
argument.
