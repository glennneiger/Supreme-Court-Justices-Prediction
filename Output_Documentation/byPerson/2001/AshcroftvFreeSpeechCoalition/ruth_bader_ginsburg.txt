but
in
terms
of
what
you
outlined,
in
terms
of
the
two
dangers,
you
say
just
the
same
as
if
it
were
an
actual
child.
well,
if
it's
a
very
young
adult
who
looks
like
a
child,
it
seems
to
me
everything
that
you
said
about
the
virtual
pornography
would
apply
to
a
young
adult
who
looks
like
a
child.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
because
it's
obscenity,
you're
creating,
you
would
have
us
create
yet
another
category
of
prohibitive,
something
that
falls
totally
outside
the
first
amendment.
have
you
claimed,
as
justice
scalia
suggested
you
might
have,
that
at
least
some
of
this
material
is
obscene
and
therefore
covered
without
regard
to
any
new,
any
child
pornography
catalog...
category.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
vast
difference
between
an
actual
child
who
was
violated
and
a
picture,
a
simulation
in
ferber
that
you
have
relied
on
so
heavily,
what
do
you
make
of
a
sentence
that
is
not
in
the
footnote,
it
is
the
text,
that
simulation
outside
the
prohibition
and
the
prohibition
was
using
an
actual
child,
simulation
outside
the
prohibition
could
provide
an
alternative?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
even
that
sentence
in
ferber
said
we're
not
touching
in
this
case,
here
we
have
an
actual
child
simulation
outside
that
prohibition
could
provide
an
alternative.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
used
those
words.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
if
we
read
that
sentence
as
though
it
were
not
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
in
the
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
clement,
before
you
finish
there's
something
of
great
concern
to
me
too
because
it
seems
that
this
is
a
big
step
away
from
actual
child,
injury
to
an
actual
child
to
the
effect
on
the
viewer
and
the
same
thing
could
be
said
for
women
with
respect
to
pornography,
portraying
women
in
a
degrading
way.
the
same
thing
could
be
said
for
hate
speech.
so
this,
where
there
is
no
actual
child
victim,
where
it's
a
picture
and
you're
talking
about
the
effect
of
that
on
the
viewer,
why
isn't
it
the
same
for
all
these
other
things
that
can
have
a
very
bad
effect
on
the
viewer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
have
this
out
you
can
use
simulated
children,
that
will
protect
the
actual
children
from
being
exploited.
why
can't
you
say
one
as
much
as
the
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
the
question
is
whether
you
could,
a
court
could
say
well,
to
keep
this
within
constitutional
bounds
we
will
read
into
the
statute
this
broad
requirement
that
there
be
an
actual
showing
of
sexual
organs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
law
put
the
burden
on
you,
on
the
defendant
to
show
that
this
depiction
does
not
use
an
actual
child.
the
defendant,
because
of
this
proof
problem,
is
not
brought
out,
the
confusion
is
it
a
real
child,
is
it
a
simulation.
suppose
it
were
made
the
defendant's
burden
to
show
that
no
actual
child
was
used
in
this
picture,
would
you
have
a
constitutional
objection
to
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
if
we
accept
the
government's
limiting
construction,
the
government
is
urging
that
we
use
this,
take
the
congressional
finding,
read
it
into
the
text
of
the
statute
and
then
it
would
cut
out
all
the
good
things.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
supposing
that...
suppose
we
could
consult
congress,
they
would
say
yeah,
preserve
as
much
of
this
as
is
constitutional.
we
wanted
to
do
a
whole
lot
but
if
the
constitution
only
allows
us
to
do
a
little
we'd
rather
have
the
court
say
that
than
to
throw
out
our
entire
product.
