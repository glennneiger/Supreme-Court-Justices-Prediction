justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
because
she
couldn't
tell
whether
the
real
child
was
over
18
or
under
18
or
because
she
couldn't
tell
whether
it
was
a
real
person?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
she
have
the
same
difficulty
on
the
distinction
between
an
18-year-old
and
a
19-year-old?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it...
why
is
it
that
witnesses
can
explain
the
age
but
cannot
explain
whether
it
was
computer
generated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
trouble
you
at
all
that
the
statute
would
prohibit
a
motion
picture
company
from
employing
an
18-year-old
actress
to
play
the
three
roles
that
justice
breyer
identified?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
actress
is
under
the
statutory
age,
18?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
trouble
you
that
the
statute
would
prohibit
an
18-year-old
who
is
a
child
under
the
statute
from
performing
those
three
roles?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
scene
of
a
head
of
a
person
who
the
other
information
in
the
movie
makes
it
appear
they're
engaged
in
sexual
intercourse
and
all
that
is
seen
is
the
head
of
a
male
and
a
female
kissing
one
another,
that
would
come
covered
by
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
it's
simulated
sexual
intercourse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
expressly
says
there's
no
patently
offensive
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
asking
us
to
read
that
phrase
into
the
statute,
the
virtually
indistinguishable
phrase?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
asking
us
to
construe
the
statute
narrowly
to
apply
only
to
things
that
are
virtually
indistinguishable
from
actual
behavior,
it
would
eliminate
cartoons
and
that
sort
of
stuff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
romeo
and
juliet?
it
interprets
one
scene
there
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
defined
in
the
statute,
sexually
explicit
conduct
that
was
in
quotes
means
actual
or
simulated
sexual
intercourse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
includes
sexual
intercourse,
it
seems
to
me
it's
sexual
intercourse
whether
you
see
the
entire
body
or
only
part
of
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
not
correct
in
remembering
that
one
of
the
amendments
to
this
series
of
statutes
by
congress
specifically
eliminated
the
requirement
of
patently
offensive
and
the
like?
