mr.
clement,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
again
relating
to
the
affirmative
defenses
or
youthful
adult
pornography.
there
appears
to
be
no
affirmative
defense
for
possession
of
something
that
in
fact
used
adults,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
relate
that
to
something
that
perhaps
a
number
of
people
in
this
courtroom
have
seen.
the
film,
traffic,
which
depicts
i
guess
someone
who
purports
to
be
under
18
engaged
in
conduct
that
would
fit
under
the
definition
of
the
statute
to
be
banned,
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
see
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
so
presumably
it
would
be
covered.
now,
there
is
no
defense
to
someone
who
rents
the
movie,
they
possess
it,
no
affirmative
defense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
the
defense
for
the
producer,
but
there
isn't
for
the
person
who
rents
the
film.
it's
just
i--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i'm
struck
by
what
we're
supposed
to
do
with
a
statute
like
this.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
court
relied
very
heavily
on
the
notion
that
if
you
use
actual
children
they
are
harmed,
they
are
actually
harmed,
so
what
is
the
primary
reliance
that
you
make
for
applying
the
same
prohibition
to
these
video
images?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
did
seem
to
me
that
the
court,
and
i
was
here,
played
heavy
reliance
on
harm
to
children.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
actual
children.
so
i'm
asking
you
what
is
your
primary
reliance
when
you
don't
have
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
the
language
that
says
conveys
the
impression,
you
want
us
to
give
the
same
meaning
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
it
cover
things
beyond
obscene
speech?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
your
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
images
of
obscenity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
the
expansion,
is
covering
images
of
obscenity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
does
it
cover
depictions
of
something
more
than
obscenity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
have
any
examples
of
the
use
of
computer
generated
images
covered
by
this
statute
where
it
has
serious
literary
or
educational
value
or
scientific
value?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
have
examples
of
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
your
concern
is
with
the
expansion
to
these
images
of
things
that
are
already
prohibited
and
yet
i
don't
think
we
have
examples
of
any
serious
use
of
them
in--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--areas
which
would
be
of
concern.
the
examples
that
we've
talked
about
today
and
that
i
think
you've
identified
seem
to
be
of
films
using
youthful
adults.
