mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner's
argument
if
adopted
would
have
three
radical
tragic
consequences
for
first
amendment
jurisprudence.
first
in
the
name
of
protecting
children
all
visual
messages
of
adolescent
sexuality
will
be
forever
barred
regardless
of
their
scientific,
artistic
or
educational
value.
second,
countless
visual
depictions--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--certainly,
in
the
film
area.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
lolita,
traffic.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
it's
gotten
critical
acclaim.
the
movie
traffic,
i
think,
won
an
academy
award.
there's
the
movie
tin
drum.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
there's
the
movie
traffic,
there's
the
movie
tin
drum,
there's
a
whole
bunch
of,
you
know,
there's
the
brooke
shields
movies
that
maybe
some
people
don't
enjoy,
but
again
it's
there,
the
blue
lagoon
and
the
series
of
movies
such
as
that.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
it
could
very
well
affect,
i
think,
painters
because
the
statute...
excuse
me.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
it
could,
if
the
movie...
a
movie
of
romeo
and
juliet
were
made.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
well,
it
depends
on
how
they
wanted
to
portray
it.
i
think
they
would
have
to
be
prevented
from
showing
or
simulated
sexual
activity
because
if
they
are
in
fact,
you
know,
to
be
considered
to
be
underage.
and
secondly,
countless
visual
depictions
of
adult
sexuality
will
be
prohibited
where
the
adults
depicted
appear
to
some
unknown
censor
to
be
younger
than
18.
and
third,
it
would
open
the
door
to
banning
other
forms
of
expression
simply
because
the
expression
could
be
misused
and/or
abused
by
a
small
segment
of
society.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
one
is,
i
think,
enforcement
of
the
obscenity
laws
would
be
one
way.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
your
honor,
there's--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--i
believe
that
title
18,
section
2251
covers
that
problem.
in
the
past
there
have
been
numerous
prosecutions,
i
think,
prior
to
the
passages
of
this
act.
in
1995
a
member
of
the
department
of
justice
testified
before
the
senate
committee
that
heard
evidence
about
this
statute
and
indicated
that
there
had
been
a
conviction
rate
of
over
97
percent
in
cases
that
had
been
brought
against
people
for
the
possession
or
dissemination
of
material
containing
a
depiction
of
a
minor.
so
that
in
fact
has
not
been
a
problem
in
the
past
and
apparently
in
this
all
in
umbrella
statute
where
they
used
any
visual
depiction,
which
in
fact
if
you
use
the
terminology
any
visual
depiction
it's
not
just
limited
to
virtually
indistinguishable--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--i
have
no
problem,
this
is
a
new
statute,
2251
and
2252
did
exist.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
it
used
the
terminology,
it
created
a
category
of
computer
images
that
would
be
nonreal
or
other
pictures
or
images
that
are
nonreal
and
that
are
fictional
characters
into
the
act
and
it
would
be
prohibited
if
disseminated
or
possessed.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
no
it
did
not,
it
included,
it
said
any
visual
depiction,
that
would
include
that
could
be
considered
cartoons,
illustrations,
drawings,
paintings.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
but
the
problem
is
it
would
still
suffer
from
the
vagueness
because
what
would
happen
is
that
in
fact
i
had
a
computer
image
of
a
fictional
character
i'd
never
have
a
defense
because
i
could
not
come
forward
and
prove
that
that
fictional
character
was
over
18.
so
if
someone
believed--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--well
but
that
leaves
it
to
the
discretion.
it
may
be
that
the
current
administration
may
not
enforce
this
language
but
down
the
road
nobody
knows
what
will
happen.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
well,
i
believe
when
you
begin
to
talk
about
first
amendment
rights
to
put
it
on
to
a
case
by
case
basis
i
think
you
are
abridging,
you
know,
a
fundamental
right
and
i
think
that
in
addition
to
that
you
have
the
problem
that
if
i
get
charged
you're
not
just
being
charged
with
a
violation
of
an
obscenity
law,
you're
being
accused
of
being
a
child
pornographer
and
that
does
have
some
connotation
and
that
has
some
ill
effects
just
from
the
fact
of
being
charged.
and
i
would
have
no
defense.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
well--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--in
this
it
does,
it
would
cover,
you
know,
the
morphing
situation--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--i'm
using
the
term
morphing
where
you
use
an
identifiable
and
you
can
merge
it
in
on
the
computer
to,
you
know,
into
similar--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--that's
correct,
or
of
a
sexual
act--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--well,
it
would
be
images,
it
would
be
copying
images
of
obscenity
with
an
identifiable
individual
or
in
sexual
conduct
and
that
is
harm
to
a
real
child
because
that
person
is
an
identifiable
child
and
that
becomes
a
permanent
record.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
well,
when
you
use
the
terminology
simulated
sexual
activity
it
would,
you
know,
it
depends,
i
guess
that
goes
community
to
community.
but
what
you
have
is
like
in
the
movie
trafficking
where
you
have
a
young
lady
under
a
cover
with
a
man
on
top
of
her,
you
only
see
their
heads
but,
you
know,
the
simulated
means
the
appearance
of,
and
that
in
fact
does
give
the
appearance
and,
you
know,
in
that
situation
it
is
a
representation
in
the
movie
that
that
person
is
under
the
age
of
18--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--the
problem
is,
is
that
the
statute
uses
the
term
actual
sexual
activity
and/or
simulated,
and
again--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--but
that's
not
what
the
statute
says,
though.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
no
it
doesn't,
because
it
says
explicit
sexual
conduct,
actual
or
simulated
and
i
guess
it
depends
on
how
you
read
that
word
simulated.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
it
means
clearly
and
again
clearly
would
mean
to
me
that
if
it
appears
that
they're
under
the
blanket
and
that's
what
they're
doing
i
think
it's
a
reasonable
inference
to
be
made
and
i
think
that
it
would
cover
that
as
simulated
activity.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
it
can,
but
it's
not
defined
in
the
statute.
they
could
have
gotten
rid
of
the
word
simulated.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
and
some
other
things,
and
it
uses
masturbation
and--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--i
agree
with
your
honor
that
it
would
be
simulated
if
they're
under
the
blanket
and
you
see
the
heads.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
you
know,
legislatures
write
statutes,
i
think
the
courts
interpret
them
and
i
think
to
construe
it
you'd
be
basically
rewriting
the
statute
if
you
did
that,
if
you
eliminated
that
terminology
and
i
don't
think
the
government
has
urged
that.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
they've
done
that
in
the
child
pornography
area
a
long
time
ago.
they
did
that
in
ferber
when
they
said
that
it,
just
if
it
merely
is
children
involved
in
sexual
activity
it's
a
violation
of
the
law
and
it's
not
subject
to
the
three-prong
test
of
miller
and
the
patently
offensive
is
a
part
of
the
miller
test.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
well--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--today
i
don't
know
that
we
have
examples
today
of
that.
i
mean,
i
would
think
that
if
we
convert
the
videos
and
the
films
that
are
being
made
today
into
dvd,
those
are,
that's
a
computer,
digital
computer--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--well,
if
i--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--well,
that
would
be
correct
but
i
think
it's
not,
you
know,
too
in
the
distant
future
that
we
will
be
making
films
that
will
be
virtual
reality.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
but
the
problem
with
that
is
it
creates
a
chilling
effect
because
who's
going
to
take
the
chance?
i
mean
that's
it,
if
the
government
says
if
it's
close
to
the
line
i
think
the
petitioners
have
indicated
in
their
brief
that
if
it's
close
to
the
line
then
just
don't
do
it,
you
know,
don't
publish
it,
don't
make
it,
and
that's
censorship.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
well,
i
think
that
becomes,
you
know,
an
excuse.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
it
is
not
true.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
yes,
because
i
think
you
can
look
at
the
senate
hearing
report
where
it's
indicated
that
in
1995
in
relation
to
cases
that
were
brought
there
was
a
conviction
rate
of
97.6
percent.
in
addition
to
that,
that
since
the
enactment
of
this
law
the
government
has
not
lost
a
case
and
it
was
raised
in
the
kimbrough
case
and
it
was
raised
in
the
fox
case,
they
were
able
to
get
a
conviction.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
that
congressional
finding,
i
don't
think
it
was
empirically,
there
was
no
empirical
evidence
that
was
really
shown
to
congress
that
that
is
correct,
that
the
computer,
and
i
believe,
and
i
think
it's
clear--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--yes.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
that's
correct.
and
i
believe
if
you
want
to
make
it
easier
for
the
government
to
make
convictions
i
think
that
we
could
get
rid
of
the
bill
of
rights
and
it
would
be
much
easier
for
the
government
then
to
get
convictions.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
that
was
that
government
witness.
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
are
not
witnesses
out
there
and
experts
that
can
make
that
distinction
that
if,
you
know,
there
clearly
would
be,
pardon?
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
it
could
have
been.
i
didn't
hear
the
testimony
in
that
case
but
they
did
in
fact
get
a
conviction
in
that
case.
but
i
think
it's
equally
as
dangerous
to
create
a
barrier
to
first
amendment.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
we
don't
know
they
wouldn't
have
gotten
a
conviction
with
that...
the
testimony
in
that
case
was
that
the
expert
indicated
that
he
was
not
sure
and
could
not
positively
say
whether
it
was
real
or
not
real.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
it
creates
an
inference
and
a
jury
can
draw
inferences
from
the
evidence.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
yes,
i
would.
and
the
reason
being
is
that
at
least
in
the
possession
area
that
is
not
an
affirmative
defense
because
all
it
has
to
be
in
the
affirmative
defense,
there
is
no,
the
element
of
age,
of
being
able
to
come
forward
and
show
that
it's
not
a
real
child
or
that
it's
underage
is
not
available--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--i,
the
possessor
though,
you'd
be
switching
the
burden
of
proof
then
i
believe
and
i
think
that
would
be
an
unconstitutional
shifting
of
the
burden.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
i
believe
that
it
is.
i
think
the
affirmative
defense
that's
in
this
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
there
are
currently,
there
are
currently
lots
of
laws
that
deal
with
anyone
who
attempts
to
entice
a
child
and
i
believe
that
those
laws
could
be
enforced
and
i
believe
that
the
penalties
could
be
increased
and
that
could
be
a
deterrent
effect
on
that.
we're
talking
about
the
use
of
this
material
potentially
by
a
very
small
segment
of
the
population
and
i
think
it
affects--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--but
here
you
can't
legislate
that
if
it's
not,
if
it's
a
virtual
murder
and
there
has
been
no
murder,
you
don't
go
out
and
arrest
people.
here
if
you
use
a
virtual,
a
fictional
character
you
can
go
out
and
arrest
people.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
but
if
you
use
the
principle
that's
involved
here
then
i
do
believe
you
begin
the
slippery
slope.
you
go
from
the
idea
you
can
use
this
and
expand
it,
you
can
use
it,
you
know,
that
if
you
have
depictions
such
as,
you
know,
the
movie
the
godfather,
the
movie
pulp
fiction
which
are
cult,
you
know,
movies
that
are
attractive
to
children,
someone
could
come
out
and
say,
hey,
look,
join
my
gang,
look
how
much
fun
it
can
be
if
we
go
out
and
become
extremely
violent.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
i
think
they
can--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--that's
not
correct
because
they've
been
able
to
get
convictions
and
they've
gone
forward
and
they've
gotten
convictions.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
but
i
don't
believe,
you
know,
at
least
currently
they've
not
lost
any
of
the
cases
and
there's
only
been
the
one
where
someone
has
raised
the
issue
and
that
expert
had
indicated
that
they
weren't
sure.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
i'm
going
to
go
back
and
i'm
not
begging
the
question,
again,
if
i
have,
if
there
is
virtual
murder
that
looks
so
real
on
the
screen,
i
don't
go
out
and
charge
anyone
with
murder.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
if
you
take
the
logic
that's
behind
here
about
people,
you're
getting
at
the
person
who
is
misusing
the
material
and
there
certainly
i
think
is,
you
can't
even
do
medical--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--but
the
obscenity
here
we're
making
just
because
it's
a
fictional
character
visually
participating
in
an
activity
that
i
can
write
about,
we're
now
saying
you
cannot
express,
that
we're
saying,
we're
giving
it
a
social
status,
and
i
think
when
we
start
to
do
that
then
we
start
to
eliminate,
we
can
start
eliminating
other
areas
equally.
i
further
believe
that,
you
know,
as
i've
indicated,
that
the
affirmative
defense
seems
to
be
inadequate.
it
certainly
does
not
cover
the
individual
possession
and
that
individual
is
in
a
position
where
if
he
has
three
images,
if
he
gets
a
dvd
movie
and
he
takes,
and
it
has
more
than
three
images
in
it,
he's
now,
you
know,
can
be
prosecuted
for
possession
of
child
pornography.
and,
again,
with
the
definition,
when
you
put
it
together
with
the
definition
of
simulated.
i
think
that
it
is
not
narrowly
tailored,
it
is
overly
broad
because
i
think,
again,
it
covers
literary
material,
it
carries
certainly
for
medical
research,
one
cannot,
there
is
no
bona
fide
exception
here
for
medical,
scientific
or
educational
or
artistic
merit,
it's
a
blanket
across
the
board
prohibition.
i
believe
the
court
clearly
indicated
in
ferber--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--i
believe
that
the
court
has
indicated
in
the
past
in
turner
broadcasting
and
in
the
landmark
communications
case
that
it's
not
for
the
court
to
be
rewriting
statutes
as
they
come
out
of
congress
and
particularly
in
the
area
when
it
deals
in
areas
of
first
amendment.
and
i
think
that
the
act,
you
know,
and
what
we're
proposing
here--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--all
we're
asking
is,
is
the
court
sever
out
two
phrases
and
that
is
that
is,
is
it
appears
to
be
and
that
it,
you
know,
and
where
it
conveys
the
impression
that
a
minor
is
engaged
in
sexual
activity.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
you
did
read
in
the
elements
of
knowingly
and
you
have
to
do
that.
basically
the
government
is
doing
the
same
thing
in
this
particular
statute
because
the
knowingly
appears
in
this
statute
exactly
as
it
appeared
in
the
statute
that
was
interpreted
by
the
court
in
x-citement
video.
it
says
knowingly
in
relation
to
mailing
or
to
transporting,
it
doesn't
say
knowing
as
to
the
knowledge
of
the
particular
minority.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
the
court
has
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
yes,
in
x-citement
video
the
court
did
do
that.
but
we're
urging
here
that
the
fact
is
that
the
ferber
and
osborne
were
based
upon
the
harm
to
real
children
and
we're
now
limiting
something
because
of
the
message.
we
are
socially
making
a
determination
here
that
this
is
speech
we
don't
like.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
yes.
it
would
mean--
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
--they're
fictional
characters,
because
i
think
they
do
have
a
valid
use
in
medical
research.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
it
would
make
it
narrower.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
again,
i'd
have
to
see
the
whole
statute
and,
again,
i
think
that
it
would
depend
on
how
it
works
and
whether
it
still
had
the
problems
with
the
affirmative
defense.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
that
could
be
done.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
yes,
and
i
think
that
most
communities
would
feel,
i
think
that
all
communities
would
feel
that
that
is
patently
offensive.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
i
believe
that
it
would.
mr.
h.
louis
sirkin
thank
you.
