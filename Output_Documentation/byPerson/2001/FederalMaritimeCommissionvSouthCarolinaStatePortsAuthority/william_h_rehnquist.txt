chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
01-46,
the
federal
maritime
commission
v.
the
south
carolina
state
ports
authority.
mr.
hughey.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
isn't
that
adjudication,
if
it
applies
the
law
to
findings
of
fact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
doesn't
it
involve
a
decision
as
to
whether
this
particular
respondent
before
the
commission
has
violated
some
provision
of
the
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
a
court,
that
it's
not
making
an...
making
an
ad
hoc
regulation
on
these
particular
facts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a...
is
a
private
plaintiff
entitled
to
take
a
decision,
or
order,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
of
the
commission,
and
seek
to
have
it
enforced
by
a
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
would
the
eleventh
amendment
defense
raised
by
the
state
there
prevail?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
california
v.
united
states,
the
united
states
was
a
party,
so
there
was
no
eleventh
amendment
question
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
case
itself,
united
states
v.
california,
raised
no
eleventh
amendment
problem.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any...
i
mean,
it's
sort
of
an
interesting
question,
but
i
wonder
if
there
are
laws
or
rules
which
say
that
the
congress
says
that
any
ship,
including
ships
belonging
to
foreign
states
that
enter
new
york
harbor,
will
abide
by
the
rules
of
the
new
york
harbor
authority,
and
if
they
don't,
you
can...
there's
some
argument
about
whether
the
pilot
comes
on
or
something,
that
ship,
including
a
military
ship
of
a
foreign
nation,
or
any
other,
has
to
adjudicate
the
controversy
in
front
of
the
new
york
authority
or
other...
i
don't
know
how
that
works,
but
maybe
you
do.
i
imagine
they
are
subject
to
our
rules
when
they
come
here,
and
bring
their
ships
into
the
harbor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
commission
have
contempt
powers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
it
issues
its
process
to
a
state
and
the...
like
the
entity
in
the
present
case,
and
the
entity
simply
fails
to
show
up,
what
can
it
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
the
behest
of
the
attorney
general,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
what
would
be
the
eleventh
amendment
situation
there,
when
the
commission
went
into
district
court
to
try
to
enforce
its
order
to
require
appearing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
be
by
the
united
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
hughey.
mr.
clement,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
the
commission
isn't
just
like
kind
of
an
ombudsman
here.
i
mean,
it's
got
very
definite
procedures
that
greatly
resemble
adjudication.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
dean,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
statutory
liability,
is
that
enforceable
by
the
commission
without
court
order,
or
did
it
have
to
go
to
court
to
do
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
sovereign
immunity
for
the
united
states
may
not
be
co-extensive
with
sovereign
immunity
for
the
states.
granted
that
sovereign
immunity
to
the
states
goes
beyond
just
the
literal
language
of
the
eleventh
amendment
about
the
judicial
power.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
counsel
doesn't
ask
questions.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
you
really
don't
need
your
third
argument,
do
you,
that
the
state
sovereign
immunity
is
co-extensive
with
federal
sovereign
immunity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
johnson
act
certainly
didn't
say
that
south
carolina
was
exempt
from
the
requirement
of
the
shipping
act,
that
it
not
discriminate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
certainly
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
shipping
act
in
its
prohibition
against
discrimination
can't
be
applied
to
south
carolina
other
than
on
a
sovereign
immunity
basis,
are
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
yes,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
in
1787
we
adopted
a
constitution
so
they
didn't
have
to
approach
one
another
as
sovereign
to
sovereign
any
more.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dean.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hughey,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hughey.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-46
federal
maritime
commission
versus
south
carolina
state
ports
authority
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
