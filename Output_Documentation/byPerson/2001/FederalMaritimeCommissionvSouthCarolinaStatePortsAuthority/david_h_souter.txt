justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
you
get
around
the,
sort
of
the
principle
of
dignity
which
has
been
emphasized
in
every
case,
i
think,
since
seminole,
and
it's
been
given
a
prominent
place
in
the
reasoning
of
the
court
majority
in
those
cases,
that
it's
the
dignity
of
the
states,
and
so
on,
which
must
be
preserved.
if
under
the
rule
of
sovereign
immunity
which
overarches
the
eleventh
amendment
there
were
indefeasible
dignity
interests
in
the
adjudication,
say,
in
seminole
and
all
of
them,
doesn't
it
follow,
a
fortiori,
that
there
are
dignitary
interests
that
would
be
offended
by
hauling
the
state
in
front
of
an
article
i,
a
purely
administrative
tribunal?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
leaves
the
question
in
a...
unanswered,
i
guess.
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
the
co-existence.
what's
the
answer
to
the
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
certainly
agree
with
you.
[laughter]
because
dignity
seems
to
have
been
taken,
in
fact,
as
one
of
the
interests
to
be
served
by
sovereign
immunity.
why
doesn't
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity,
why
doesn't
it
apply
if
applied
in
those
other
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
it
seems
to
me
intuitively
just
the
opposite.
i
mean,
these
are
tribunals
that...
if
we're
going
to
talk
about
dignity,
these
are
tribunals
that
do
not
have
the
dignity
of
the
judicial
forums
that
were
at
stake
in
the
preceding
cases,
and
i
would
have
supposed
that
the
offense
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
was
even
greater
to
pull
the
state
before
these
lesser
tribunals.
justice
david
h.
souter
everything
was
fine
in
seminole
and
all
of
them,
until
we
got
to
the
point
of
judgment?
i
mean,
is
that
the
way
you're
trying
to
cut
the
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
it
the
case
that
if
the
state
defaults
and
says,
you
have
no
jurisdiction
over
me,
and
the
commission
therefore
comes
to
a
conclusion...
we'll
leave
the
word
adjudication
out
of
it.
it
comes
to
a
conclusion.
that
conclusion
itself
is
enforceable
as
such,
at
the
behest
of
the
national
government,
in
a
district
court,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
it's
not
contrary.
let's
assume
the
maritime
commission
says,
you,
private
party,
are
right,
and
we
hold
that
the
state
has
committed
the
following
violations,
and
i
presume
should
be
enjoined
from
further
commission,
whatever
order
it
might
come
up
with.
once
the
commission
has
come
to
such
a
conclusion,
isn't
that
conclusion,
as
such,
enforceable
at
the
behest
of
the
united
states
in
the
district
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
if
that
is
so,
there's
something
much
more
involved
here
than
merely
an
agency
of
the
national
government
taking
a
complaint
seriously
and
investigating
it,
and
the
difference
is
that
in
the...
under
the
act,
its
conclusion
on
the
investigation
becomes
an
enforceable
order
at
the
behest
of
the
national
government
in
a
district
court,
and
isn't
that
the
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
federal
government
could
have
an
interpretation
of
the
shipping
act
and
go
into
it...
assuming
there
is
otherwise
a
statutory
jurisdiction
here,
the
national
government
could
have
a
view
of
the
shipping
act
and
go
into
the
district
court
and
say,
this
is
our
considered
view,
and
the
other
party
would
have
an
opportunity
to
oppose
it.
we'd
have
a
lawsuit.
as
things
stand
now,
when
the
united
states
goes
in
with
what
you
call
its
considered
view,
that
is
the
end
of
the
issue
on
the
merits,
as
i
understand
it.
the
only
thing
the
district
court
is
there
for
is
to
enforce
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
they
have
a
trial
de
novo
on
the
merits?
justice
david
h.
souter
could
they
collaterally
attack
and
say,
look,
it
doesn't
mean
anything
to
us,
because
we
can't
be
hauled
in
front
of
the
commission
by
a
private
party.
can
it...
is
such
a
plea
recognized?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
don't
think
it
is,
either,
and
that's
why
your
argument
that
this
is
nothing
but
a
way
for
the
national
government
to
take
a
considered
view
of
a
complaint
and
come
to
a
conclusion
seems
to
me
beside
the
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not...
you
keep
speaking
about
an
eleventh
amendment
bar.
the
bar
is
sovereign
immunity.
we're
not
concerned
about
the
textual
limitations
about
the
eleventh
amendment.
we're
concerned
with
sovereign
immunity.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
slightly
different
question.
if
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
is
not
the
judicial
power
that's
being
exercised
here,
do
you
lose?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
you
lose?
justice
david
h.
souter
pardon
me?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it's
irrelevant
because?
justice
david
h.
souter
sovereign
immunity...
in
other
words,
you've
got
a
sovereign
immunity
argument
which
is
at
least
distinct
from
the
eleventh
amendment
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
i
thought.
