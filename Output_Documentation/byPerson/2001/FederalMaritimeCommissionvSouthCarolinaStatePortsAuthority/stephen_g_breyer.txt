what
about
the
labor

justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
labor
board,
universities?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
state
universities
and
the
labor
board.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
i'm
thinking
that
the
universities
often
have
unions,
and
i
gather
that...
why
hasn't
the
labor
board
been
involved
in
adjudicating
complaints
about
the
state
university
as
an
employer
in
respect
to
the
labor
unions?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
it
hasn't.
i
wouldn't
know
why
it
wouldn't
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
arguing
with
you.
i'm
just
wondering
why
there
were
not
more
examples.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
i
go
back
to
your
opening
statement?
why
is
it
an
exercise
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states?
i
mean,
we
have
an
ordinary
administrative
agency.
what's
the
theory
of
it?
i
mean,
i
grant
you,
i'm
sure
you're
right,
that
there's
some
case
that
said
once
the
court
of
claims,
which
is
a
court
in
exercising...
though
set
up
under
those
article
i
exercises
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states,
so
my
constitution
says
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it's
a
lawsuit,
not
a
lawsuit,
i
don't
care.
i
want
to
know,
is
it
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states,
and
frankly,
i
didn't
know
that
the
executive
branch
could
exercise
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whatever
they
held,
i
want
to
know
what
the
reasoning
of
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't?
my
constitution
happens
to
say,
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
shall
not
be
construed,
so
i'm...
maybe
i
don't
have
to
find
it,
but
i'd
like
to
know
on
what
basis
i
wouldn't
have
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
fine,
it's
not
within
the
scope
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
no,
i
want
to
know
if
it
is
with...
forget
the
fact...
i
think
it
is
within
the
scope
of
the
eleventh
amendment
if
a...
i
believed,
as
far
as
i
know,
when
a
citizen
of
a
state
sues
the
state
itself,
of
which
he
is
a
citizen,
it
is
an
interpretation
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
i
didn't
know
that
for
that
purpose
you
didn't
have
to
find
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states,
so
i'm
open
to
that
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know,
is
this
the
judicial
power?
if
so,
what's
the
argument?
if
it's
not
the
judicial
power,
what
part
of
the
constitution
forbids
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
all
administrative--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
the
federal
trade
commission
exercise
the
judicial
power,
does
the
state
department,
does
the
commerce
department,
the
post
office...
i
mean,
what
is
the
principle
under
which
this
is
or
is
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
president,
let's
say,
when
he's...
you
see
the
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
now
that
i
can
quote
one
of
my
favorite
authors,
justice
scalia,
he
says
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
all
such
administrative
bodies
adjudicate,
they
determine
facts,
apply
a
rule
of
law
to
those
facts,
and
thus
arrive
at
a
decision--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
there
is
nothing
inherently
judicial
about
adjudication.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what
is
it
that
makes
it
the
judicial
power?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
judicial
power
is
what
we're
all...
and
i'm--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
what
is
the
boundary?
apparently
you're
now
talking
about
a
principle
of
state
sovereign
immunity
outside
the
scope
of
amendment
11
of
the
united
states
constitution,
and
i
haven't
really
heard
of
that
one.
i'm
not
saying
it
doesn't
exist,
but
where
do
i
go
to
discover
what
its
bounds
are,
to
discover
what
the
implications
are,
to
discover
if
it
applies
when
the
president
does
anything?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
the
scope
of
that
one
is,
so
where
do
i
go
to
find
out
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
just
asking...
my
question
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
other
words,
hans
you
say
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
hans
does
not
have
to
do
with
the
eleventh
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
it
does
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
how
do
i
discover
the
scope
of
this
principle
of
state
sovereign
immunity
outside
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
hans
was
a
court
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
it's
not
a
case,
then,
in
which
they
say
it's
not
the
judicial
power--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
why
is
it
a
case
in
which
they
say...
isn't
it...
i
mean,
i'm
back
on
my
judicial...
forget
it,
i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
justice
stevens,
justice
souter,
justice
ginsburg
and
i
dissent.
we
have
dissented
frequently
from
the
court's
interpretation
of
the
constitution's
structural
prohibitions,
those
involving
sovreign
immunity,
the
eleventh
amendment,
the
commoners
clause
in
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
today's
case
indicates
why
we
continue
to
do
so.
the
case
involves
an
ordinary
independent
executive
branch
agency
which
seeks
through
ordinary
agency
adjudicated
proceeding
to
determine,
at
the
request
of
a
private
party,
whether
a
state
instrumentality
or
court
authority
has
violated
a
federal
statute.
the
majority
finds
in
the
agencies
use
of
adjudication,
a
constitutional
analogy
to
other
proceedings,
court
proceeding
which
the
eleventh
amendment,
for
example,
says
that
a
private
party
cannot
bring
against
the
state,
but
constitutionally
speaking,
we
think
that
analogy
is
inadequate.
agency
adjudication
differs
in
detail
from
court
adjudication,
that
is
why
we
call
agency
adjudication
quasi
adjudicative.
the
agency
cannot
enforce
the
law
itself
but
has
to
go
to
court
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
to
do
so.
the
proceedings
take
place
in
the
executive
branch
of
government,
not
the
judicial
branch
which
is
subject
to
the
eleventh
amendment
and
one
confined
other
at
least
equally
compelling,
i
would
say
more
compelling,
constitutional
analogies
that
work
just
the
other
way,
for
example
in
a
private
citizen's
first
amendment
right
to
ask
the
government
including
the
executive
branch
of
government
to
readress
a
grievance
including
a
grievance
against
the
state.
where
then
does
the
majority
find
its
contitutional
prohibition?
not
in
the
constitution's
text
which
it
concedes
there
is
not
a
word
about.
not
in
history,
not
in
tradition,
rather
the
majority
appeals
to
the
constitution's
federalism
related
purposes,
purposes
embodied
in
such
non-textual
phrases
as
state
dignity,
plan
of
the
convention,
system
of
federalism.
these
phrases
of
course
are
highly
abstract
and
compared
to
other
general
constitutional
phrases,
words
like
liberty
or
due
process
of
law,
they
suffer
from
the
disadvantage
that
they
do
not
actually
appear
in
the
constitution.
regardless,
why
does
one,
a
private
citizen's
complaint
to
an
administrative
agency
asking
has
the
state
violated
the
law
followed
by
an
agency
adjudication,
why
does
that
upfront
a
state's
dignity
any
more
then;
two,
the
identical
complaint
made
to
the
identical
agency
followed
by
agency
rule
making;
or
three,
the
identical
complaint
made
to
congress
followed
by
congressional
hearings
in
enactment
of
a
law.
the
only
answer
to
these
questions
that
i
can
find
in
the
court's
opinion
lies
in
the
"great
significance"
--
and
those
are
the
court's
words
that
the
court
attaches
to
the
absence
in
the
18th
century
of
20th
century
administrative
agencies.
an
absence
that
i
find
hardly
surprising.
in
taking
this
approach
in
the
court's
readiness
to
find
in
silences,
in
18th
century
absences,
in
broad
interpretation,
in
formal
reasoning
from
highly
abstract
nontextual
concepts.
in
finding
that
way
of
prohibition
that
forbids
other
branches
of
the
federal
government
from
acting.
in
taking
that
approach,
the
court
risks
departing
from
a
constitutional
understanding
that
it
is
held
for
more
than
60
years,
that
the
constitution
forbids
an
overly
restrictive
judicial
interpretation
of
its
structural
constraints,
an
interpretation
that
denies
the
legislative
in
executive
branches,
the
flexibility
they
need
to
deal
effectively
with
modern,
social,
technological,
and
commercial
problem.
an
interpretation
that
impedes
the
constitution's
basic
effort
to
create
democratic
government
that
can
translate
the
people's
will
into
effective
public
action.
indeed,
the
majority's
holding
today
may
well
impede
the
federal
government
as
it
seeks
to
enforce
against
state
employers
laws
designed
to
protect
worker
health
and
safety,
as
it
seeks
to
enforce
against
state
hospital's
legal
procedures
designed
to
protect
patients,
as
it
seeks
to
enforce
against
state
commercial
or
port
authority's
laws
and
procedures
designed
to
protect
commerce
or
for
that
matter
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out
in
the
prince
case,
to
protect
national
security.
at
the
same
time,
the
majority's
holding
may
require
the
building
of
larger
federal
bureaucracy.
quite
the
opposite
of
the
decentralizing
purposes
of
the
constitutional
principles
that
it
seeks
to
implement.
for
these
reasons
and
for
others
discussed
in
the
opinion,
in
my
dissenting
opinion,
unless
and
until
the
consequences
of
the
court's
approach
prove
anodyne
as
i
hope,
rather
than
randomly
destructive,
as
i
fear,
i
shall
continue
to
dissent.
