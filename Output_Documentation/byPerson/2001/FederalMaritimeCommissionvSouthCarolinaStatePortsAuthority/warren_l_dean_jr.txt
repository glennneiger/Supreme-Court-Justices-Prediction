mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
sovereign
immunity
protects
a
state
from
a
private
suit
brought
before
a
federal
administrative
tribunal.
we
have
heard
today
arguments
and
suggestions
that
this
proceeding
is
not
a
suit
within
the
meaning
of
the
doctrine
and
principle
of
sovereign
immunity.
in
1868,
this
court
addressed
this
question.
it
held
in
nichols
v.
united
states
that
a
proceeding
before
an
article
i
administrative
tribunal,
a
so-called
legislative
court,
just
like
the
federal
maritime
commission,
was
a
suit
for
sovereign
immunity
purposes.
the
case
was
appealed
from
an
appeals
court.
the
court
confirmed
that
legislative
court
status
of
the
claims
court
twice,
in
ex
parte
bakelite
in
1929,
and
then
in
williams
v.
united
states
in
1933,
and
later
in
1934
the
court
again,
in
united
states
v.
sherwood,
unanimously
confirmed
both
conclusions,
that
states...
that
claims
court
was
an
article
i
legislative
court,
and
its
jurisdiction
was
dependent
upon
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
there
were
no
dissenting
justices
in
any
single
one
of
those
decisions.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
we've
made
that
clear
throughout
this
proceeding,
justice.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
that's
exactly...
that
is
exactly
what
does
not
happen
in
this
case,
your
honor.
a
private
complainant
files
a
complaint
before
the
federal
maritime
commission,
we
receive
the
notice,
we
either
respond
or
we're
in
default.
it
is
quite
clear...
and
i
submit
with
all
due
respect
that
mr.
clement
is
absolutely
wrong
on
this.
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
agency
can
find
both
findings
of
fact
and
findings
of
law
against
a
nonresponding
party.
that's
been
established
administrative
procedure
law
for
sometime
and,
in
fact,
the
private
party
controls
the
disposition
of
this
proceeding.
the
executive
arm
of
the
federal
maritime
commission,
its
bureau
of
enforcement,
does
not
even
have
a
right
to
intervene
in
the
proceeding.
it
has
to
petition
like
any
other
private
party
to
get
involved
in
the
proceeding.
they
did
not
do
that
in
this
case.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
they
have
to
show
cause
for
intervention,
justice
kennedy,
just
like
any
other
private
party
would
do.
they
have
no
greater
standing
than
any
other
private
party.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
oh,
absolutely.
that's
the
way
the
commission
traditionally
does
business.
that
is
an
entirely
separate
proceeding.
that
is
the
proceeding
to
which
we
would
not
object.
if
a
private
party
came
into
the
commission
and
said,
we
have
this
grievance
against
the
south
carolina
state
port
authority
and
we'd
like
you
to
look
into
it,
and
the
bureau
of
enforcement
came
to
us
and
said,
we
think
you're
doing
something
wrong,
we
would
obviously
talk
to
them,
and
if
we
couldn't
reach
some
kind
of
accommodation
with
respect
to
that
matter,
then
we
would...
and
they
brought
a
complaint
against
us,
they
would
be
entitled
to
do
that
if...
provided
the
complaint
was
brought
in
their
names
and
formed
by
the
united
states.
and
i
might
add
that,
in
a
reparations
proceeding...
this
is
not
a
sanctionless
exercise.
in
a
reparations
proceeding,
if
the
agency
issues
an
order
against
us,
a
judgment
against
us,
and
we
fail
to
comply
with
that
judgment,
we
incur
statutory
liabilities,
automatic,
of
up
to
$25,000
a
day.
now,
they
can
be
compromised
by
the
agency
for
a
period
of
5
years
after
each
violation,
if
it
so
chooses,
but
any
time
somebody
says
to
me,
for
example,
that
if
you
don't
do
xyz
you're
going
to
incur
an
automatic
statutory
liability
of
$25,000
a
day,
i
consider
that
a
sanction,
and--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--ultimately,
if
push
comes
to
shove
and
there's
a
confrontation,
they
have
to
go
to
court,
but
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
anybody
faced
with
a
statutory
liability
of
the
united
states
imposed
by
federal
law
considers
that
a
sanction,
and
we
do
not
have
the
opportunity
to
protect
our
interests,
to
say,
no,
no,
no,
this
wasn't
a
violation,
this
is
what
we
did,
when
the
agency,
the
only
standard
for
the
enforcement
of
the
agency's
order
in
court
is
whether
or
not
it
was
duly
and
regularly
issued.
so
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
this
is
not
a...
that
this
is
a
proceeding
that
is
essentially
equivalent
to
a
petition
by
a
private
party
for
executive
action
is
absolutely
incorrect,
and
they
don't
even
believe
that
position
themselves.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
the
court
below
held--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--well,
the
reasoning...
the
judicial...
you
don't
need
to
find
the
judicial
power.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
this
is
a
case
brought
by
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
south
carolina,
like
chisholm
v.
georgia,
i
might
add,
against
the...
against
a...
the
state
of
south
carolina.
it's
not
technically
for
those
terms
and
those
terms
alone
within
the
scope
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
it's
hans
v.
louisiana.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
well--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--first,
it
is...
we
have
stated
it
is
the
judicial
power,
but
you
need
not
find
that,
and
i'll
give
you
the
reason
it
is
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states,
is
because
this
agency
acts
as
an
adjunct
to
the
court,
just
as
this
court
has
held
in
northern
pipeline
and--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--it
is
the
exercise
of...
the
shipping
act
entails
the
exercise
of
judicial
power,
justice
stevens.
you
can
look
at
this
either
as
an
organic
analysis,
as
you
have
done
under
the
appointments
clause
of
the
commission
itself,
or
you
can
look
at
the
statutory
process
and
procedure
that
is
involved.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
well,
the--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--in
your
book,
justice
breyer,
you
call
this
an
uneasy
constitutional
area,
and
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
[laughter]
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states,
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
cases,
including
the
cases
that
i
just
mentioned,
that
the
judicial
power
can...
at
least
some
component
of
the
exercise
of
the
judicial
power
in
a
comprehensive
proceeding
can
be
delegated
to
nonjudicial
officers,
provided
it
is
subject
to
judicial
supervision
and
subject
to
some
specific
supervisory
parameters
that
exist
in
this
case,
but
it's
a
complicated
question,
and
the
court
has
disagreed
on
it,
and
various
court
have
disagreed
on
this
question
for
sometime,
and
in
fact,
in
some
of
the
cases
that
i
just
mentioned,
the
united
states
supreme
court
took
appellate
jurisdiction
from
an
article
i
tribunal
in
the
executive
branch,
and
under
those
circumstances
something
was
going
on
before
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
well--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--granted,
but--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--what
is
it
that
makes
it
subject
to
sovereign
immunity,
or
what
is
it
that
makes
it
the
judicial
power?
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
well,
the
judicial
power,
if
you
look
at
a
proceeding,
an
administrative
proceeding
like
the
shipping
act,
and
this
court
held
that,
held
this
in
the
far
east
conference
case,
it
said,
you
can't
take
one
isolated
aspect
of
it.
you
cannot
take
the
organic
entity
which
is
the
federal
maritime
commission
and
consider
its
functions
independent
of
the
rest
of
the
proceeding
that
is
involved.
ultimately,
this
proceeding
ultimately,
in
combination
with
the
courts
of
the
united
states,
this
proceeding
invokes
the
judicial
power,
whether
the
fmc
is
acting--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--well,
this
is--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--i
know,
but
this
is
clearly
not
purely
executive
action.
this
is
an
independent
agency,
and
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
officers
that
exercise
quasi-judicial
power
can
be
subject
to
special
removal
requirements,
and
that
is--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--no,
but
let
me...
both
in
hensel
and
in
artistani,
and
in
this
court's
decision
in
west
v.
gibson--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--like...
the
claims
court
was
within
the
department
of
treasury
at
the
time
these
decisions
were
handed
down.
that
doesn't
necessarily
resolve
the
matter,
but
it
does
instruct
the
court's
analysis
that
this
is
a
quasi-judicial
independent
agency--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--and
its
officers
are
not
subject
to
executive
supervision.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
no.
it
would
be
the
same
case
depending
on
the
statutory
process
involved,
justice
stevens.
the
agencies--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--it
was...
the
court
of
claims
was
in
the
department
of
treasury
at
the
time,
and
customs
officials
have
done--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
it
is.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
no.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
the
court
below
said
it
was
irrelevant.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
the
court
below
said
it
was
irrelevant,
and
i
agree
with
that
proposition.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
because
sovereign
immunity--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--absolutely.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
and
the
united
states
has
a
sovereign
immunity
argument,
and
they
apply
sovereign
immunity--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--the
united
states
applies
its
sovereign
immunity
in
proceedings
just
like
this.
it
has
for
all
time.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
has
held
sovereign
immunity
applies
to
the
united
states
in
administrative
proceedings
consistently
for
the
last
130
years,
and
there
has
not
been
one
single
dissent
from
that
proposition
that
i've
been
able
to
find.
in
west,
all
the
justices
of
this
court
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
that
analysis
that
sovereign
immunity
principles
apply
before
the
eeoc.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
agree
with
that
proposition
in
the
abstract,
but
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
there's
a
lot
of
similarity,
and
i'll
give
you
exactly...
i'll
tell
you
exactly
why
i
think
why.
firstly,
the
courts
have
held
that
it's
a
reciprocal...
this
court
has
held
over
the
years
that
it
is
a
reciprocal
privilege,
but
the
united
states
in
its
brief
in
this
case--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--well,
in
alden
and
in
hans
and...
the
court
has
held
that
the
privilege
of
federal
sovereign
immunity...
state
sovereign
immunity
is
a
reciprocal
privilege
to
the
privilege
enjoyed
by
the
states.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
co-extensive
mirror
image,
yes,
justice
scalia.
the
united
states
has
suggested
in
this
case,
and
it's
a
proposition
that
i
agree
with,
that
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
at
least
as
it
applies
to
money
judgments...
and
it's
much
broader
than
money
judgments,
but
let's
just
talk
about
money
judgments
for
a
minute,
that
at
least
as
it
applies
to
money
judgments
is
informed
by
the
appropriations
clause,
which
reserves
to
the
legislature,
to
the
congress
the
right
to
spend,
and
we
all
know
the
right
to
spend
is
the
right
to
tax.
so
our
body
politic,
our...
the
public...
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
made
a
determination
that
their
constitution,
which
is
their
sovereign,
commits
to
the
legislative
branches
the
exclusive
right
to
expend
the
public's
money,
and
that's
a
very
fundamental
principle
in
our
federal
constitution.
that
principle
is
also
reflected
word
for
word
in
this
constitution
of
south
carolina--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
i
do.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
no,
this
court
has
held
that
they
have
consented
to
suit,
so
it
doesn't
apply
in
that
area.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
in
this
constitution
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
that
was
adopted
9
years
before
this
constitution
was
adopted,
there
is
the
same
appropriations
clause.
the
same
principle
is
reflected,
that
no
moneys
may
be
obligated--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--but
this
is
a
constitutional
principle
justice
stevens.
it
is
a
question--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--i
ask
you
this
question
as
a
hypothetical.
the
constitution
of
this--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
constitution
of...
i'll
state
it
in
a
declaration.
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
reflects
the
same
principle
reflected
in
the
appropriations
clause.
we
have
two
sister
sovereigns,
both
of
them
organized
on
the
same
fundamental
principle
that
only
the
people
have
the
right
to
levy
on
the
public
treasury,
and
only
the
people
through
their
elected
representatives,
and
only
the
people
have
the
right
to
spend,
and
therefore
only
the
people
have
the
right
to
tax.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
now,
you
have
these
two
comparable
constitutions.
how
do
you
put
them
together
and
violate
that
principle?
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
stevens.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
that
suit
belongs
in
federal
court,
and
i
doubt
very
seriously
that
the
commission
has
that
statutory
jurisdiction.
the
reason
is
that
it
has
jurisdiction
over
persons
engaged
in
the
business
of
operating,
or
internal
operators.
i
very
sincerely
doubt
that
any
individual
employee
would
satisfy
that
test,
but
the
test
certainly
exists
under
ex
parte
young.
the
opportunity
might
exist,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
proper
way
for
the
individual
to
proceed
in
this
particular
case
would
be
to
file
a
declaratory
judgment
under
state
law,
which
is
available,
to
obtain
the
relief
the
individual
requested.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
the
shipping
act
gives
the
fmc
jurisdiction
over
individuals
who
are
employees
of
entities
that
are
engaged
in--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--the
officers
of
the...
i
don't
believe
the
shipping
act
gives
the
fmc
jurisdiction
over
officers
of
entities
that
it
regulates.
i
don't
believe
it
has
that
kind
of
personal
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
that
issue
has
not...
i
am
not
aware
that
that
issue
has
decided,
but
i
frankly
have
grave
doubts
that
it
would.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
well,
the
proper
way
for
the
federal
maritime...
as
i
said,
i
don't
think
the
fmc
has
that
jurisdiction.
it
does
have
jurisdiction
over
us.
all
it
has
to
do
is
initiate
its
own
complaint.
when
the
alj
dismissed
the
complaint
in
this
case,
he
invited
the
commission,
if
the
commission
deemed
the
case
had
merit,
satisfying
the
test
in
alden,
he
invited
the
commission
to
initiate
a
proceeding
through
its
own
enforcement
bureau.
the
commission
did
not
do
so.
instead,
they
reversed
the
alj's
order,
which
is
in
turn
reversed
by
the
fourth
circuit.
the
parties
in
this,
the
federal
parties
in
this
case
do
not
challenge
the
holdings
of
this
case
in
nichols,
hans,
sherwood,
alden,
or
seminole,
so
in
effect
what
they're
asking
this
court
to
decide
is
the
following
three
propositions,
and
all
of
the
following
three
propositions:
that
lesser
tribunals
established
under
article
i
have
powers
that
both
state
and
federal
courts
lack,
even
though
they
constitutionally
may
adjudicate
only
subject
to
the
supervision
of
the
latter;
2)
that
congress,
merely
by
assigning
a
private
cause
of
action
to
administrative
tribunal,
acquires
and
exercises
power
it
does
not
otherwise
have
to
abrogate
state
sovereign
immunity,
thereby
bypassing
this
court's
sovereign
immunity
jurisprudence,
and
3)
that
states
lack
the
reciprocal
right
to
assert
sovereign
immunity
in
federal
fora
where
the
immunity
of
the
united
states
clearly
applies.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
i
don't
need
that
third
argument,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
quite
correct,
but
what
the
united
states
asserts,
says
about
administrative
proceedings,
if
they
were
purely
executive
action...
for
example,
if
it
was
purely
an
executive
branch
matter,
this...
the
united
states
has
come
into
this
court
on
numerous
occasions
most
recently
in
artistani
and
west,
and
asked
this
court
to
intervene
in
what
they
now
say
is
a
purely
executive
branch
matter.
there
was
no
inquiry.
there
was
no
special
analysis
that
the
court
did
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
intervention
in
that
kind
of
purely
executive
branch
matter
was
warranted.
there
was
no
discussion
of
that.
the
court
assumed
that
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
as
it
applied
to
the
federal
government
applied
to
it,
and
i
might
add
that--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--if
the
president
does
something
and
the
president--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--hans...
hans
v.
louisiana
is
the
only
place
you
need
to
go.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
by
its
terms
it
held
it
was
outside
the
scope
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
it
does
not
by
its
terms
have
anything
to
do--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--it
reflects
the--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--well,
the
same
way
you
discover
the
principle
of
federal
sovereign
immunity.
you
look
at
what
the
nature
of
the
proceeding,
and
the
nature
of
the
affront
to
the
dignity
of
the
sovereign
is
being
involved,
you
identify
what
the
sovereign's
interests
are,
and
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
money
judgment
it
violates
the
same
clause
of
our
constitution
that
it
violates
in
the
case
of
the
federal
constitution,
and
that's
pretty
persuasive.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
no.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
although
i
might
add,
justice
stevens--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--that
the
pure
participation
in
this
lengthy
proceeding
has
had
consequences
for
the
treasury
of
the
state
of
south
carolina,
but
nonetheless,
it's
much
broader
than
that,
yes,
your
honor.
it
goes
to
the
nature...
as
this
court
held
in
seminole,
and
i
might
add,
when
i
was...
when
we
argued
the
case
before
the
fourth
circuit
we
had
a
little
discussion
about
whether
or
not
the
state
of
south
carolina
was
willing
to
be
a
scofflaw.
in
other
words,
whether
we
were
willing
to
have
our...
to
have
allegations,
whether
they
be
frivolous
or
serious,
against
us
go
unanswered
in
an
administrative
tribunal
that
concededly
regulates
us
in
washington
and
have
as
the
united
states
maintains
this
become
a
precedent
that
would
affect
their
dealing
with
us
in
the
future
without
defending
ourselves,
and
that's
simply
not
a
realistic
option
for
the
state
of
south
carolina.
it's
not
a
realistic
option
for
anyone,
much
less
a
sovereign.
if
there's
anything
to
dignity,
there's
a
dignity
to
that,
to
be
able
to
defend
yourself
against
allegations
and
not
have
people
who
are
decisionmakers
make
judgments
against
you--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--based
on
unanswered
allegations,
or
unanswerable
allegations.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
no,
it's
far
better,
justice
stevens,
to
have
a
person
come
to
the
agency,
present
its
concerns
to
the
agency,
and
the
agency
approach
the
state
of
south
carolina,
one
sovereign
to
another
sovereign.
this
case
involves
the
regulation
of
gaming
ships.
the
congress
has
committed
that
to
our
discretion
under
state
law.
we
are
given
that
right.
the
johnson
act,
which
gave
us
the
right
to
regulate
gaming
ships,
does
not
say
that
it's
subject
to
review
by
the
federal
maritime
commission.
it
does
not
say,
for
example
that
the
federal
maritime
commission--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--has
the
right
to
preempt
the
congress.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
just
like
the
department
of
justice
does
when
it
enforces
the
laws
against
the
states,
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
proper
way
of
doing
it,
because
we
can
and
will
address
those
allegations
at
that
time,
but
i
can
assure
you
that
the...
this
case
implements
policies
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
that
are
important
to
it,
the
regulation
of
gaming
ships,
the
johnson
act
congress
has
said
it's
up
to
the
state
of
south
carolina
to
make
those
policies
and
to
implement
those
policies--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--no,
but
i
can...
that's
correct,
but
in...
any
regulatory
system
has
at
its
core
the
right
to
make
discretionary,
discriminatory
judgments
about
what
does
and
does
not
comply
with
the
policies
of
that
regime.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
and
the
fmc
is
now
sitting
in
judge...
as
a
judge
of
the...
of
our
implementation
of
state
law
as
authorized
by
the
johnson
act.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
no,
we're
not,
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
if
they
exercise
the
executive
discretion
that
they
ought
to
act,
that
the
constitution
envisions
them
enacting,
that
they
would
approach
us
as
a
sovereign,
we'd
say,
these
are
our
sovereign
interests,
they'd
say,
they
are
their
sovereign
interests--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--ultimately
they
would
trump
ours,
if
there
was
a
disagreement--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--that's
true,
but
in
this
particular
area
the
congress
has
decided
that
the
sovereign
state
of
south
carolina
gets
to
do
the
regulating,
mr.
chief
justice,
so
we
would
come
down
and
we
would
have
two
different
regulatory
regimes,
and
we
would
approach
each
other,
and
we
would
resolve
the
differences
between
them,
and
if
they
disagreed,
if
ultimately
they
disagree,
they
could
bring
a
complaint
against
us,
which
they
have
the
right
to
do,
and
we
would
defend
it,
and
we
would
participate.
we
would
have
the
opportunity
to
defend
ourselves,
and
we
would
defend
ourselves,
and
so
that's--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--there
is
no
statement
that
waives
sovereign
immunity.
i
think
that's
been
conceded
in
the
proceedings
below.
there's
no
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
this
case.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
oh,
no,
clearly
not.
there's
no
mention
in
the
shipping
act
at
all
of
intention
to
waive
state
sovereign
immunity.
i
can't
find
a
mention
in
the
shipping
act
of
intention
to
waive
federal
sovereign
immunity
if
and
when
the
federal
government
ever
wants
to
get
into
the
business
of
operating
ports.
it
operates
two
airports
in
the
washington
area,
so
i
don't
think
it's
inconceivable
that
it
might
do
so
at
some
point,
but
it
is
clearly...
it
is
clearly
no
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
even
if...
even
going
back
to
the
law
where
it
said
the
congress
could
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states,
of
the
states,
i'm
sorry,
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
intent
whatsoever
in
the
shipping
act
to
do
that.
the
fact
that
the
federal
maritime
commission
may
bring
its
own
actions
against
the
united
states...
against
the
states
as
it
did
in
the
california
case
proves
the
opposite
proposition,
that
the
congress,
that
was
the
proper
way
to
proceed,
and
i
think
that
is
the
proper
way
to
proceed.
the...
i'd
like
to
go
back
to...
this
complaint
is
a
verified
private
complaint.
it
is...
calls
for
reparations
in
the
broadest
form
of
reparations,
including
consequential
damages,
interest
and
attorney's
fees,
the
commission
has
no
discretion
in
the
handling
of
this
complaint,
it's
required
by
law
to
adjudicate
it,
and
the
agency's
findings
become
final
subject
only
to
judicial
review.
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
anomalous
proceeding
suit
that
the
court
had
in
mind
in
hans,
and
hans
came
30
years
after--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
the
sovereign
immunity--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--yes,
but
they
held
that
the
court
was...
they
held
the
state
immune
from
the
proceeding.
obviously,
the
proceeding
had
already
been
completed,
but
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
now
that
the
dignity
of
the
sovereign
entails
to
the
entire
proceeding,
applies
to
the
entire
proceeding,
but
you
know,
this
question
about
the
dignity
of
the
sovereign,
the
court
in
hans
gave
us
some
instructions,
some
future
instructions--
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
--hans
is
a
court
case.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
just
like
federal
sovereign
immunity
is
a
court
case.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
warren
l.
dean,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
