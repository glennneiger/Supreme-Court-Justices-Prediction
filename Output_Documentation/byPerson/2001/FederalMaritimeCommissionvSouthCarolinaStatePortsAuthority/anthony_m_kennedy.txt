justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
the
conclusion,
but
what
justice
scalia's
asking,
and
i
think
we're
interested
in,
is
whether
there's
any
precedent
that
you
could
cite,
any
historical
source
that
says
that
an
administrative
tribunal
can
summon
a
sovereign
before
it
and
render
a
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
it's
the
dog
that
didn't
bark
theory,
it
seems
to
me
that
cuts
against
you.
if
this
has
never
been
done,
that's
probably
because
it
can't
be
done.
at
least
we
can
make
that
inference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
talking
about
the
shipping
act.
i'm
talking
about
other
authority.
if
you're
saying
that
the
shipping
act
is
the
precedent-breaking
ground,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
then
on
somewhat
a
slender
foundation
for
your
argument
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
not...
i
don't
understand
the
argument.
sovereign
immunity
is
based
on
parties,
and
we
have
said
that
when
the
united
states
is
a
party,
there's
no
sovereign
immunity,
and
not,
incidentally,
because
that
was
inconsistent
with
some
earlier
notion
of
sovereign
immunity,
because
the
constitution
changed
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
here
we
have
a
private
party.
that's
all...
isn't
that
all
the
difference
in
the
world?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
mr.
clement,
when
i
began
to
read
your
brief
and
i
sensed
that
the
sky
was
falling,
and
so
i
was
turning
my
pages
to
see
all
of
the
horrible
things
that
were
going
to
happen
to
the
federal
scheme
if
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
stood,
and
i
didn't
see
much
there.
there's
the
vending
stand
act
in
one
of
the
circuit
courts,
but
do
federal
agencies
call
governors
before
them
all
the
time
and
say,
well
now,
governor,
you're
not
enforcing
the
federal
laws?
i
don't
see
that
as
part
of
our
constitutional
tradition.
i
don't
see
that
we
would
create
a
great
revolution
in
traditional
practice
by
pulling
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--have
standing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
not
be,
perhaps,
as
intellectually
satisfying
as
resolving
the
case
specifically
on
the
merits.
is
it
open
to
us
to
say
that
there's
no
clear
statement
that
waives
sovereign
immunity,
as
we
did
in
vermont
yankee?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there's
no
clear
statement
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
intending
abrogate--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
only
to
the
extent
they're
seeking
a
money
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
hans
was
purely
a
money
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
that
you
cannot
fine
the
state?
