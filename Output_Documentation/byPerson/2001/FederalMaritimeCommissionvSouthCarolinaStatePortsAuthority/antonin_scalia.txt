congress--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hughey,
why
do
you
assume
that
if
this
is
not
judicial
action,
sovereign
immunity
doesn't
apply?
i
mean,
i
guess
whatever
sovereign
immunity
the
states
retained
upon
the
formation
of
the
federal
constitution
was
the
sovereign
immunity
that
existed
in
international
law
at
the
time.
can
foreign
sovereigns
be
summoned
before
executive
or
legislative
tribunals
in
this
country?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
state
sovereign
immunity
is
just
what...
the
sovereign
immunity
that
they
had
at
international
law.
that's
what...
the
eleventh
amendment
is
just
a
reflection
of
the
fact
that
they
retained
that
sort
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
that,
you
know,
if
the
king
of
england
summons
george
washington,
president
of
the
united
states,
to
appear
before
a
parliamentary
commission
or
some
royal
tribunal
instead
of
an
english
court.
i
think
george
washington
would
say,
you
know,
go
fly
a
kite.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you
can't,
because
the
eleventh
amendment
is
just...
we
have
held
that
it
represents
just
a
reflection
of
the
fact
that
the
states
retained
that
sovereign
immunity
that
they
had
before
the
formation
of
the
federal
republic,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--justice
souter
says
the
sovereign
immunity
interest
is
co-extensive
with
the
dignitary
interest.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
could
have
made
them
appear
and
just
said,
you
know,
we
understand
that...
just
as
you're
saying,
we
understand
that
an
order
can't
issue
against
you,
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
shouldn't
show
up.
we
haven't
said
that
in
sovereign
immunity.
we've
said
the
state
does
not
have
to
appear.
it
is
hauling
the
state
before
the
tribunal
that
is
the
offense,
not
just
the
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
court
can't
say
it,
but
the
eleventh
amendment
says
it.
i
mean,
and
whereupon
the
court
can
say,
look,
you
know,
by
reason
of
your
sovereign
immunity,
we
understand
if
you
show
up
we
can't
issue
any
contempt
judgment,
we
can't
issue
a
merits
judgment
against
you,
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
don't
have
to
show
up.
but
it
does
mean
you
don't
have
to
show
up,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
threat
of
coercive
judgment.
the
eleventh
amendment
makes
it
very
clear
that
you
can't
issue
the
coercive
judgment,
but
the
state
still
doesn't
have
to
show
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
congress
could
certainly
handle
that
by
making
it
very
clear
by
legislation
that
if
the
state
runs
one
of
these
operations,
the
state
waives
its
sovereign
immunity.
couldn't
congress
make
that
clear?
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
executive
action
does.
i
mean,
that's
just
too
broad
a
principle.
i
mean,
the
fact
is,
since
we
don't
have
a...
we
have
a
constitution
that
has
a
habeas
corpus
clause.
there's
nothing
the
executive
can
do
to
you
that
can't
be
challenged
in
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
ultimately,
the
court
is
the
moment
of
truth,
but
that
doesn't
convert
every
executive
action
into
an
exercise
of
the
judicial
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
so
if
this
wasn't
an
independent
agency,
it
would
be
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what
do
you
mean
by
that,
that
it's
a
reciprocal
privilege?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
reciprocal
you
mean
that
it's
co-extensive?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
what
justice
ginsburg's
question
went
to,
you're
saying
you
don't
have
to
name
the
individuals,
but
suppose
that
we
held
that
you
couldn't
name
the
state,
do
you
think
you
have
authority
to
name
the
individuals?
