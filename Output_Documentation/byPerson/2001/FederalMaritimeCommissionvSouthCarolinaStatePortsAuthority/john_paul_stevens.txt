justice
john
paul
stevens
--did
you
say
it
was
the
exercise
of
judicial
power?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you...
may
i
just
interrupt
you?
what
if
this
were
an
executive
agency,
rather
than
an
independent
agency?
could
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that's
not
answering
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question?
if
it
were
a
pure
executive
agency,
would
it
be
the
same
case
for
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
statuary
process,
but
clearly
an
executive
agency
within
the
department
of
commerce
or
department
of
agriculture,
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
a
little
too
fast
for
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
answer?
is
it
the
same
case
entirely
within
the
executive
branch?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
don't
think
the
states
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
exclusive
right
to
determine
when
their
money
will
be
spent
in
a
proceeding
brought
by
the
united
states,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
say
that
the
states
have
the
same
power
over
their
own
money
that
the
united
states
has
over
its
money,
in
an
action
brought
by
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
sovereign
immunity...
even
in
an
action
brought
by
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
don't
have
sovereign
immunity
in
cases
brought
by
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
was
before
the
supremacy
clause
was
adopted
in
the
federal
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
a
constitutional
protection...
principle
that
protects
the
states
from
liability
to
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
i
understand
your
argument,
it's
not
limited
to
the
reparations
part
of
the
case.
there's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--also
a
request
for
a
cease
and
desist
order.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
really
need
the
reparations
for
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
let
me
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
interrupt
you
for
just
a
moment,
please?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
put
the
reparations
to
one
side,
and
let's
assume
you're
dead
right
on
the
monetary
aspect
of
the
case.
is
it
your
position
that
it
would
be
in
everyone's
best
interest
to
have
proceedings
like
this
initiated
ex
parte,
and
then
the
agency
makes
up
its
mind
whether
to
go...
bring
an
enforcement
proceeding,
or
it
would
be
better
to
have
a
formal
proceeding
where
you
have
a
chance
to
respond
to
the
charges
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
you
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you
have
an
issue
such
as
this
in
which
the
agency
thinks
there's
a
colorable
basis
for
a
proceeding,
do
you
think
the
only
way
they
can
proceed
against
you
formally
is
to
first
of
all
get
all
the
information
ex
parte
from
the
private
parties,
and
then
make
up
their
own
mind
as
to
whether
to
bring
a
formal
proceeding
in
the
name
of
the
agency?
