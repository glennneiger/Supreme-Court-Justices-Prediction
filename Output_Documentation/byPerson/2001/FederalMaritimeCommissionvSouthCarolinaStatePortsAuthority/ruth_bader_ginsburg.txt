do
you
concede
that
at
least
as
to
reparation,
where
as
i
understand
it
the
government
can
go
into
the
district
court
to
seek
reparations,
only
the
private
party,
at
least
as
to
seeking
dollars
from
the
state
agency,
that
the
eleventh
amendment
would
preclude
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
agencies
have
a
pattern
like
this,
where
they
determine
the
rules
by
rule-making,
this
kind
of
adjudication,
and
a
commission-initiated
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dean,
but
that
was
an
article
i
court
that
just
adjudicates.
here
we're
being
told
that
the
maritime
commission
is
in
the
business
of
making
rules
for
the
governance
of
people
in
the
trade,
and
it
makes
the
rules
three
ways.
one
through
rule-making,
another's
through
commission
proceeding,
and
a
third
through
private
complaints,
and
why
couldn't
the
private
complainant
be
regarded
as
a
kind
of
delegate
to
the
commission?
i
take
it
if
the
commission
itself
decided
to
investigate,
you
would
have
no
question
about
sovereign
immunity,
is
that
true?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right.
so
why
can't
the
commission
say,
one
of
the
ways
that
we
investigate
is,
we
listen
to
what
private
people
tell
us,
so
that
in
effect
we're
taking
that
private
complaint
and
we're
making
it
our
own
by
processing
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
the
private
party
ask--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
could
a
private
party
say
to
the
commission,
commission,
here's
a
serious
complaint,
something
wrong
has
been
done,
i
don't
have
the
resources
to
prosecute
it,
would
you
please
investigate
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dean--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
dean--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
recognized
a
case
called
ex
parte
young,
and
let's
say
that
the
private
complainant
says,
okay,
i'm
not
going
to
sue
the
state
court
authorities.
i'm
going
to
sue
the
commissioners,
and
so
as
the
fmc
to
please
substitute
for
the
entity
the
individual
commissioners,
and
they
said
go
ahead,
and
they
don't
have
sovereign...
individuals,
at
least
with
respect
to
prospective
relief
do
not
have
sovereign
immunity.
why
couldn't...
is
that
then
just
a
matter
of
amending
a
complaint
to
name
different
parties?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
haven't
answered
the
question--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
couldn't
the
fmc
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
employees,
the
commissioners
themselves,
the
members
of
the
state
body.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
that
matter
were
clarified
so
that
congress,
wanting
the
fmc
to
have
this
third
way
of
regulating
said,
in
the
case
where
state
agencies
are
involved
you
can
sue
the
individuals,
individuals
who
compose
the
entity--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
the
commission
substitute
the
commissioners
of
the
south
carolina
ports
authority
for
the
port
authority
itself?
