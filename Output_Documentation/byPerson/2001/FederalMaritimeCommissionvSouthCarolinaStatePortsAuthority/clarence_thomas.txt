justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
south
carolina
maritime
services
inc.
filed
a
complaint
with
petition
of
federal
maritime
commission
aleging
that
respondent,
south
carolina
state
ports
authority
had
violated
the
shipping
act
by
refusing
to
provide
maritime
services
cruise
ship
to
tropic
sea,
berthing
space
at
respondent's
port
facilities
in
charleston,
south
carolina.
after
maritime
services
complaint
was
referred
to
an
administrative
law
judge,
respondent
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
arguing
that
states
sovereign
immunity
barred
the
commission
from
adjudicating
maritime
services
complaint.
the
administrative
law
judge
agreed
but
the
commission
decided
on
its
motion
to
review
the
administrative
law
judge's
ruling
and
reversed,
reasoning
that
the
doctrine
of
state
sovreign
immunity
was
not
meant
to
cover
adjudicative
proceedings
before
administrative
agencies
such
as
the
commission.
respondent
then
filed
a
petition
for
review
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
commission's
determination
holding
that
sovreign
immunity
precluded
the
commission
from
adjudicating
maritime
services
complaint.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
previously
observed
that
the
central
purpose
of
state
sovreign
immunity
is
to
accord
states
to
dignity
that
is
consistent
with
their
status
as
sovreign
entities,
and
if
the
framers
thought
it
an
impermissible
affront
to
a
state's
dignity
to
be
required
to
answer
the
complaint
of
private
parties
in
federal
courts,
we
cannot
imagine
that
would
have
found
it
acceptable
to
compel
a
state
to
do
exactly
the
same
thing
before
the
administrative
tribunal
of
a
federal
agency.
a
review
of
the
rules
governing
the
commission's
judicative
proceedings
reveals
that
the
similarities
between
such
proceedings
and
civil
litigation
in
federal
courts
are
overwhelming.
the
affront
to
a
state's
dignity
does
not
lessen
when
an
adjudication
takes
place
in
an
administrative
tribunal
as
opposed
to
an
article
iii
court.
in
both
instances,
a
state
is
required
to
defend
itself
in
an
adversarial
proceeding
against
a
private
party
before
an
impartial
federal
officer.
moreover,
because
congress
is
prohibited
from
exercising
its
article
i
powers
to
abrogate
state
sovreign
immunity
in
article
iii
judicial
proceedings,
it
would
be
quite
strange
if
congress
were
allowed
to
use
those
same
article
i
powers
to
create
court
like
administrative
tribunals
where
sovreign
immunity
would
not
apply.
justices
stevens
and
breyer
have
filed
dissenting
opinions.
