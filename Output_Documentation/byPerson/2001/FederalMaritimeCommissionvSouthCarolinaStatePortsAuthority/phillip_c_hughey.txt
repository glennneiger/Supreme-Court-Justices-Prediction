mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
adjudication
of
a
shipping
act
complaint
by
the
federal
maritime
commission
is
an
administrative
regulatory
process
through
which
the
agency
makes
findings
of
fact
and
applies
its
interpretation
of
the
shipping
act
to
those
findings
of
fact.
this
is
an
exercise
of
executive
power.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
adjudication,
but
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
it's
not
judicial.
it
is
an
executive
branch
adjudication
that
permits
the
agency
to
determine
what
position
it
would
like
to
take
with
respect
to
potential
violations
of
the
shipping
act.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
yes,
and
in
that
sense,
your
honor,
it
is
an
exercise
of
ad
hoc
regulation.
it's
regulation
on
a
specific
and
discrete
set
of
facts.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
however,
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
a
court
and
a
decision
issued
by
a
court,
such
an
order
would
be
self-executing,
whereas
a
federal
maritime
commission
regulatory
determination
is
not
self-executing.
rather,
in
the
event
that
it's
not
voluntary
compliance
with
whatever
order
the
agency
reaches
at
the
end
of
an
adjudication,
the
attorney
general
or
a
private
complainant
must
go
into
a
federal
district
court
and
seek
to
have
that
federal
district
court
compel
compliance.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
yes,
i
think
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
that
a
state
might--
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
extent
to
which
the
state
feels
compelled
by
a
potential
action
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
is
compulsion
that
arises
from
an
action
of
the
federal
government
itself
in
the
name
of
the
united
states.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
yes,
your
honor,
under
the
shipping
act
a
private
plaintiff
is
permitted
to
go
into
a
federal
district
court--
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
--i
think
that
that
case
would
present
a
much
more
significant
eleventh
amendment
issue.
the
shipping
act
provides
that
the
district
court
hearing
and,
of
course,
an
action
brought
by
a
private
complainant
must
have
jurisdiction
of
the
parties.
i
would
suggest
that
to
the
extent
there's
any
eleventh
amendment
interest
that
requires
vindication
under
the
shipping
act,
that
vindication
can
be
explored
in
the
federal
district
court
proceeding.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
well,
in
its
order
in
this
case,
justice
ginsburg,
the
commissioner
finds
that
it
would
like
to
see
its
reparation
orders
deemed
to
be
enforceable
by
a
federal
district
court,
so
i
can't
concede
that
they
wouldn't
be,
but
what
i
can
say
is
that
determination
is
not
within
the
agency's
jurisdiction.
that
would
be
a
determination
for
the
federal
district
court
to
make
in
the
event
that
the
state
instrumentality
raised
an
eleventh
amendment
immunity
defense
to
the
attempted
enforcement
action
by
the
private
complainant.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
i
don't
know
whether
foreign
sovereigns
can
be
summoned
before
the--
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
--well,
i
think
that
one
can
turn
to
the
text
of
the
eleventh
amendment
itself
for
some
guidance
on
this
issue,
justice
scalia.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
it's
a
reflection,
your
honor,
of
the
immunity
from
coercive
judicial
process.
i
think
that's
why
the
eleventh
amendment
begins
that
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
shall
not
be
construed
to
any--
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
--well,
if
i
may
suggest
a
different
side
to
that
is
that
there
is
no
precedent
to
suggest
that
it
can't.
it's
been
held
by
this
court
in
california
v.
united
states
that
state-run
courts
are
subject
to
commission
regulation.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
no,
i
think
it
has
been
done
since
the
shipping
act
was
first
passed,
and
it
simply--
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
--this
court
held
in
california
v.
united
states
that
the
shipping
act
as
a
regulatory
statute
applies
to
all
state-run
courts.
what
the
commission
is
suggesting,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
that
applies
equally
with
respect
to
agency
adjudications.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
no,
the
question
i
think
was
whether
the
entire
statute,
which
at
that
time
included
a
regulatory
procedure
that
could
be
initiated
by
private
complainants,
whether
the
entire
statute,
which
was
a
coherent
regulatory
scheme,
applied
to
state-run
ports,
and
that's
what
the
court
held.
the
court
specifically
referred
to
the
scheme
for
regulating
waterfront
terminals,
not
the
specific
provision
within
that
scheme
that
permits
the
united
states
itself
to
initiate
an
investigation.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
no,
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
it
didn't
raise
an
eleventh
amendment
problem,
but
the
issue
was
whether
the
regulatory
scheme
as
a
whole
could
be
applied
to
state
instrumentalities,
and
this
adjudicatory
proceeding
under
the
shipping
act
is
part
of
that
regulatory
program.
with
respect--
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
--yes,
i
would
think
so,
and
the
commission
does
have
some
jurisdiction
over
foreign-operated
and...
foreign
operated
vessels
that
are
owned
by
sovereigns.
the
commission
regulates
sally-to-port
controlled
carriers
which
are
vessels
that
are
owned
by
governments.
if
a
complaint
were
to
be
filed
against
such
an
entity,
i
see
no
reason
why
the
commission
would
not
attempt
to
assert
its
regulatory
adjudicatory
jurisdiction
over
such
a
complaint,
but
i
know
of
no
such
specific
case
under
the
statute.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
i
think
i
would
have
two
responses
to
that,
justice
souter.
first
is
that
i
understand
the
dignitary
interest
to
be
co-extensive
with
the
sovereign
immunity
interest,
and
second--
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
--well,
i
think
the
answer
would
be,
then,
that
sovereign
immunity
doesn't
apply,
that
a
state's
dignity
is
not
offended.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
well,
i
think
that
the
dignity
of
the
state
is
less
offended
by
this
type
of
regulatory
adjudication,
given
the
fact
that
the
agency
has
no
coercive
power
to
compel
anything
from
the
state.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
well,
i
think
the
offense
to
the
dignity
interest
of
the
state
occurs
when
a
state
is
forced
to
do
something
which
is
the
result
of
a
coercive
act.
under
the
shipping
act--
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
--no.
i
think
in
cases
like
alden
and
seminole
tribe
it
was
the
threat
of
judgment
that
hung
over
the
united
states
that
was
the
problem,
because
in
those
cases,
if
the
court
entered
an
order
against
a
state
it
was
automatically
self-enforcing
them.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
well,
i
think
with
respect
to
your
hypothetical
this
court
has
found
the
power
of
coercion
or
contempt
is
the
judicial
power
necessary
to
the
exercise
of
all
others,
so
i
don't
think
that
a
court
could
just
tell
a
state,
well,
appear
and
we're
not
going
to
be
able
to
issue
an
order
against
you.
i
think
the
fact
that
coercion
can
result
from
the
judicial
proceeding
is
the
point
of
the
judicial
proceeding
and
is
what
differentiates
it
from
this
type
of
regulatory
adjudication.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
well,
yes,
the
state
can
move
to
dismiss
any
suit
that's
filed
against
it
in
a
court,
but
i
still
think
that
it's
the
threat
of
coercive
judgment
against
the
state
that
is
the
reason
that
the
state
can--
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
--i
don't
think
that
analysis
should
apply
to
this
statute,
justice
scalia,
because
under
the
shipping
act
the
agency
can...
cannot
compel
an
appearance
by
the
state.
if
the
state
just
doesn't
show
up
under
the
shipping
act,
the
only
way
to
do
anything
about
that
is
to
go
into
a
federal
district
court
and
seek
a
court
order,
and
if
the
agency
determines
to
do
that,
it
then
has
to
ask
the
attorney
general
to
do
so.
under
the
statute,
the
attorney
general
may,
rather
than
shall,
enforce
any
order
the
commission
issued.
that
is
therefore,
by
definition,
an
exercise
of
the
executive
discretion
that
this
court
found
acceptable
in
alden
v.
maine.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
no.
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
if
the
entity
failed
to
show
up,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
commission
could
issue
an
order
telling
it
to
show
up,
but
again,
that
would
have
to
be
enforced
by
a
federal
district
court,
and
if--
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
--yes.
yes.
the
commission
would
have
to
ask
the
attorney
general
to
enforce
it.
under
the
statute
the
attorney
general
doesn't
have
to,
but
if
he
determined
to
do
so,
he
could
then
go
into
a
district
court
and
try
to
enforce
the
order.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
oh,
i
would
suggest
that
there
would
be
no
eleventh
amendment
problem
there,
because
the
enforcement
action
would
be
in
the
name
of
and
by
the
united
states.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
yes.
it
would
be
in
the
name
of
and
by
the
united
states.
in
this
case,
it
would
be,
for
example,
united
states
v.
south
carolina
state
ports
authority.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
i
know
that
the
surface
transportation
board,
which
used
to
be
the
nsa
commerce
commission,
has
this
authority,
and
i
think
that
the
federal
communication
commission
does,
but
i'm
not
entirely
certain
of
that.
i
would
suggest,
if
i
may,
that
to
uphold
the
state's
claim
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
in
this
case
will
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
regulatory
scheme
that
the
congress
has
created
in
the
shipping
act
by
undermining
the
notion
of
national
uniformity
in
maritime
commercial
regulations.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
i'm
not
sure
if
that
kind
of
waiver
is
still
acceptable
after
this
court's
opinions
of
recent
years.
[laughter]
i
would
suggest
that
it's
probably
not,
but
we
think
that,
under
the
statute
as
it's
written
now,
there's
no
need
for
something
like
that,
because
it's
merely
a
regulatory
action
that
the
commission
is
attempting
to
utilize
to
find
facts
to
determine
what
constitutes
a
shipping
act
violation,
and
again,
there's
no
use
of
coercive
power.
in
order
for
there
to
be
coercion,
the
commission
has
to
go
into
a
federal
district
court.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
if
i
could
keep
going
with
your
inquiry,
justice
breyer,
i
think
we
are
suggesting
that
there
is
a
line
in
this
case,
and
that
line
is
freytag
v.
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
we're
not
suggesting
that
state
instrumentalities
would
never
have
sovereign
immunity
in
administrative
proceedings.
rather,
we're
suggesting
that
they
might
in
proceedings
in
which
contempt
power
can
be
exercised,
and
this
is
not
one
such
proceeding
because
the
agency
doesn't
have
coercive
authority
over
the
entities
that
it
regulates.
it
has
to
rely
on
a
federal
district
court
for
that.
to
make
another
point,
i
think
mr.
dean
emphasized
that
the
shipping
act
allows
the
agency
to
fine
instrumentalities
that
don't
comply
with
its
order.
however,
i
should
point
out
that
in
this
case
the
commission
has
never
indicated
that
it
has
the
authority
to
fine
a
state
instrumentality
for
not
complying
with
a
reparation
order.
that
was
something
that
ended
up
in
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion.
we've
never
said
we
could
do
it,
and
the
united
states
in
its
reply
brief
to
this
court
has
specifically
expressed
the
view
that
the
fmc
could
not
fine
a
state-run
court
for
not
complying
with
the
agency-issued
reparation
order.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
whether
and
when
the
agency's
bureau
of
enforcement
can
intervene
in
an
agency
proceeding,
i
should
point
out
that
whether
or
not
the
bureau
of
enforcement
intervenes
in
the
adjudication
does
not
get
to
the
point
of
whether
it
is
an
agency
action,
because
the
agency
always
retains
the
ability
to
review,
sua
sponte,
any
administrative
law
judge
order
that
comes
out.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
i
think
the
united
states
has
suggested
that
because
the
commission
and
the
attorney
general
don't
have
the
authority
to
enforce
a
reparation
order
against
a
state,
that
the
authority
to
fine
the
state
for
not
complying
with
that
reparation
order
would
not
be
an
appropriate
interpretation
of
the
shipping
act.
again,
that's
something,
the
commission
has
never
said
that
it
has
the
authority
to,
or
that
it
would
fine
a
state
for
not
complying
with
an
agency-issued
reparation
order.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
i'm
unsure
of
that,
justice
ginsburg,
but
we
would
suggest
that
the
pleading
requirements
of
ex
parte
young
need
not
be
imported
into
the
shipping
act,
and
that
a
request
for,
for
example,
a
cease
and
desist
order
against
the
ports
authority
would,
under
the
shipping
act,
be
sufficient,
and
that
the
complaint
need
not
name
the
commissioners
of
the
ports
authority
themselves.
thank
you...
oh,
sorry.
mr.
phillip
c.
hughey
i'm
unsure
of
that,
justice
scalia.
the
shipping
act
provides
that
complaints
must
be
filed
against
persons.
i
think
the
question
would
be
rather
whether
the
port
commissioners
are
persons.
it
may
be
that
a
fiction
could
be
conceived
that
they
would
be
under
the
shipping
act,
but
again,
that
issue
has
never
come
up
in
the
commission's
administration
of
the
statute.
thank
you.
