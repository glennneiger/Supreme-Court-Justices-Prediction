mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
states
enjoy
no
sovereign
immunity
from
federal
executive
branch
action,
even
when
it
takes
the
form
of
adjudication.
it
is
well-established
that
states
have
no
immunity
from
a
suit
brought
by
the
federal
government.
that's
true
not
because
of
some
preexisting
notion
of
sovereign
immunity,
but
because
that
consent
to
suits
by
the
united
states
federal
government
is
implicit
in
the
plan
of
the
convention.
now,
proceedings
before
the
federal
maritime
commission
are
a
necessary
predicate
for
the
united
states
government
to
bring
a
federal
suit
to
enforce
the
shipping
act.
given
that
the
states
enjoy
no
immunity
from
such
a
suit,
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
reach
back
into
the
administrative
process
and
assert
an
immunity
from
the
preliminary
proceedings
before
the
agency.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
we
have
a
private
party
that's
not
initiating
a
lawsuit,
but
is
initiating
executive
action.
private
parties
are
free
to
complain
to
the
federal
government
and
say
a
state
government
is
violating
federal
law.
in
fact,
the
petition
clause
rightly
protects
the
individual
petitioner's
right
to
petition
the
federal
government
and
complain
about
that
violation.
now,
i
don't
think
it
violates
the
constitution
for
the
united
states
federal
government
to
say,
we
take
citizen
complaints
seriously,
and
we're
going
to
investigate
each
and
every
one
of
them,
and
i
wouldn't
think
that
it
would
violate
the
eleventh
amendment
for
the
attorney
general
to
give
the
party
who's
the
subject
of
the
complaint,
even
if
it's
the
state,
an
opportunity
to
come
before--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
executive
branch
and
explain
why
there
wasn't
a
violation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
they
do
resemble
adjudication,
and
that's
part
of
the
process
to
formalize
and
regularize
this
process
of
getting
complaints
from
citizens
and
response
from
others,
but
i
don't
think
the
formalization
and
regularization
of
that
process
turns
it
into
a
judicial
act.
it
remains
an
act--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
first
i
want
to
clarify
something.
if
there's
a
case
where
the
state
doesn't
appear,
and
the
private
party
is
asserting
a
view
of
the
shipping
act
that's
contrary
to
the
view
of
the
federal
maritime
commission,
then
there
will
be
no
order.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
is...
it
would
be
enforceable
through
a
judicial
procedure
under
the
shipping
act.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
critical
difference,
because
the
reason
that
that
becomes
enforceable,
subject
to
whatever
defenses
there
are,
the
reason
that
becomes
enforceable
is
not
because
it's
the
midway
point
in
some
litigation.
it's
enforceable
because
it
reflects
the
executive
branch's
definitive
interpretation
of
the
shipping
act.
the
cease-and-desist
order--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
there
are
some
challenges
that
can
be
brought
to
that,
and
i
guess
the
problem
with
this--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
they
can't,
under
the
current
system.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
it
currently
is,
but
if
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
it...
but
the
point,
i
think...
first
of
all,
if
the
problem
is
the
level
of
review
that's
given
at
the
end
of
the
process,
then
that's
what
should
be
adjusted,
not
throwing
out
the
entire
proceeding
ab
initio
as
the
fourth
circuit
did.
but
more
to
the
point,
i
think
the
reason
there's
deference
is
because
it
reflects
the
executive
branch's
view,
and
it's
the
same
in
that
order
whether
it's
the
product
of
a
privately
initiated
complaint
and
adjudication,
or
whether
it's
an
agency-initiated
complaint.
in
both
cases
there's
going
to
be
practical
pressure
for
the
state-regulated
entity
to
participate
in
the
proceeding,
but
neither
should
they
get
an
immunity.
the
practical
pressure
is
not
the
same
as
the
compulsive
process
that
the
judiciary
has.
nobody's
summoned
before
the
commission
because
a
summons
is
necessarily
enforced
through
the
contempt
power
of
the
court.
this
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what
there
is
a
tradition
of
is
the
executive
branch
having
the
flexibility
to
determine
how
it
is
going
to
enforce
federal
law.
there
aren't
many
of
these
cases
precisely
because
there
just
aren't
that
many
state-run
entities
that
are
regulated,
but
the
executive
branch
has
the
flexibility
to
regulate
them
through
rule-making,
through
agency-initiated
adjudications,
or
through
private
adjudications.
in
each
one
of
those,
there
are
practical
pressures
to
participate.
in
each
one
of
those,
the
rule-making
can
be
initiated
by
a
private
complaint.
there's
a
specific
provision
in
the
commission's
regulation
to
allow
rule-makings
to
be
kicked
off
by
a
private
complaint,
but
that
doesn't
turn
it
into
something
other
than
the
executive
branch's
determination
of
what
the
law
is
and
how
it
should
be
enforced,
and
this
court
has
generally
deferred
to
the
executive
branch's
need
to
determine
how
best
to
take
care
that
the
laws
are
faithfully
executed.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
what's
that?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
know
the
specific
application,
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
mean,
but
one
thing
that's
certainly
clear
about
the
labor
board
is
that
that's
a
perfect
example
of
an
administrative
agency
that
decides
to
proceed
by
adjudication.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
another
example
is
the
railway
labor
act,
because
the
railway
labor
act
is...
defines
its
jurisdiction
coextensively
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
there
are
state-run
railroads
under
the
railway
labor
act.
typically
those
kind
of
employment
disputes
are
initiated
by
a
private
party.
this
court
in
california
v.
taylor
said
that
the
railway
labor
act
can
apply
to
a
state-run
railroad.
interestingly,
in
footnote
16
of
that
opinion,
the
court
reserved
the
question
of
whether
the
eleventh
amendment
provided
protection
for
the
suit
in
court,
but
it
didn't
say
anything
about
eleventh
amendment
protection
before
the
board
itself,
and
i
think
the
relevant
history
here
is
almost
exactly
the
opposite
of
the
case
in
alden.
in
alden,
this
case
had
a
long
history
of
state
sovereign
immunity,
and
very
few
and
only
recent
efforts
by
the
federal
government
to
abrogate
that
immunity.
here,
by
contrast,
there's
a
115-year
tradition
of
state
entities
being
subject
to
regulatory
commissions,
and
very
few
and
only
recent
efforts
to
invoke
any
kind
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
before
them.
i
also
think
that
the
text
of
the
eleventh
amendment
has
a
special
relevance
here
that
it
lacked
in
alden.
in
alden,
the
determination
that
state
courts
not
exercise
the,
quote,
judicial
power
of
the
united
states,
only
began
the
analysis
of
whether
or
not
the
states
enjoyed
their
sovereign
immunity
free
from
congressional
disturbance.
here,
the
recognition
that
the
commission
exercise...
does
not
exercise
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
necessarily
means
it
exercises
the
executive
power
of
the
united
states,
and
this
court
has
traditionally
held
that
the
executive
branch
may
initiate
process
against
the
states
without
an
eleventh
amendment
bar.
the
fact
that
this
proceeding--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
in
this
particular
context,
i
think
the
text
is
relevant,
because
this
is
not
a
free-floating,
pre-existing
notion
of
sovereign
immunity.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
eleventh
amendment
waiver
in
the
plan
of
the
constitution
that
allows
the
united
states
government
to
sue
a
state
also
allows
it
to
take
the
preliminary
steps
in
the
administrative
process.
