mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
did
say
that
amendments
made
to
avoid
prior
art
and
amendments
made
for
other
purposes
relating
to
securing
the
patent
present
different
problems
because
amendments
made
to
avoid
prior
art
are
almost
always
narrowing
amendments,
and
we
think
that
the
federal
circuit,
in
speaking
of
narrowing
amendments,
really
was
speaking
of
surrendering
subject
matter
which
is
the
formulation
that
the
petitioner
prefers;
whereas,
amendments
made
for
other
purposes
have
to
be
scrutinized
with
particular
care
because
they
often
are
not
narrowing
amendments.
and
indeed,
in
some
of
the
post-festo
decisions
of
the
federal
circuit,
the
court
has
held
that
there
was...
it
was
not
a
narrowing
amendment
and
therefore
there's
no
bar.
but
they
can
be
narrowing
amendments.
they
can
be,
even
though
in
the
guise
of
addressing
the
examiner's
concern
under
112,
they
could
actually
be
narrowing
the
subject
matter
of
the
claim.
and
in
that
instance,
the...
the
estoppel
would
apply.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
a
simple
example
would
be
in
warner-jenkinson
itself.
if
there
was
an
addition
of
a
limitation
on
the
ph
levels
from
6
to
9
in
the
amendment,
if
the
examiner
in
that
case
had
said
that
the
specifications
are
not
clear
enough
and
that
amendment
was
added
in
response
to
that,
even
though
the
examiner
had
raised
other
concerns,
but
the
applicant
purported
to
add
that
limitation
in
response
to
the
examiner's
concerns
about
the
specificity,
it
still
would
be
adding
a
limitation
and
it
would
be
an
implied
disclaimer
of
subject
matter
in
comparison
with
the
initial
claim.
and
our
view
would
be
that
estoppel
would
apply.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
contrary
in
the
sense
of
what
fair
inferences
can
be
drawn
by
the
public
from
the
record
of
the
prosecution
history.
when
he
started
off...
the
applicant
started
off
without
this
limitation
and
then
added
the
limitation,
the
limitation
speaks
for
itself
in
narrowing
the
scope
of
the
claim
elements.
and
that...
that
is
the
central
problem
of
this
case.
if
prosecution
history
estoppel
is
to
have
meaningful
effect,
once
we
settle
where
it
applies,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
the
lesser
question,
it
necessarily
follows,
if
it's
to
have
meaningful
effect,
that
the
claim
elements
that
have
been
narrowed
by
the
patent
applicant,
in
order
to
secure
the
issuance
of
the
patent,
cannot
be
afforded
the
same
or
almost
the
same
protection
against
non-literal
infringement
that
would
be
available
to
them
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
if
they
had
not
been
narrowed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i...
i
think
so.
these
are
doctrines
that
have
been
developed.
prosecution
history
estoppel
and
its
effects
are
really
equitable
in
origin,
and
the
courts
have
the
authority
to
reexamine
the
application
of
equitable
doctrines
in
light
of
experience.
the...
the
real
question
here,
as
we
see
it,
is
what...
how
do
you
reconcile
the
inferences
that
are
legitimately
to
be
drawn
by
the
public
with
the
patentholder's
need
for
protection
from
unfair
copying.
and
this
is
not
a
matter
of
small
moment
because
if...
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
does
not
apply,
but
the
all-elements
test
still
is
applicable,
as
the
opinions
below
reflect,
to
claims
of
literal
infringement
or
non-literal
infringement.
so,
we
have
suggested
an
answer
that
we
draw
directly
from
this
court's
decisions.
we
first
look
at
exhibit
supply,
a
1942
decision,
in
which
the
court
said
that
when
the
applicant
narrows
the
claim,
he
necessarily
is
recognizing
the
difference
between
what
was
originally
acclaimed...
claimed
and
what
the
narrowing
amendment
claims,
and
there's
an
implied
disclaimer
of
all
that
is
embraced
within
that
difference.
and
he's
recognizing
the
significance
of
that
difference.
and
it...
the
court
cited
a
number
of
its
prior
decisions
at
that
time.
so,
we
think
that
applicants
have
been
fairly
on
notice
that
prosecution
history
estoppel
does
apply
to
narrowing
amendments
and
that
there
is
considerable
risk
in
narrowing
claims
and
that
they
have
to
do
that
with
great
care
with
that
in
mind.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
they
take...
they
start
from
what--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes,
but
they
start
by
assuming
the
validity
of
the
flexible
bar
rule
and
trying
to
tighten
it
a
little
bit.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we...
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
saying
that
the
way
the...
it
has
been
applying
the
flexible
bar
rule
did
not
properly
recognize
what
had
been
surrendered
in
the
course
of
the
prosecution
history
estoppel.
but
we...
we
come
out
in
much
the
same
place
at
the
end
even
though
the
differences
between
those
and
the
federal
bar
association
also
recommends
a
presumption
and
shift
of
the
burden
of
proof
similar
to
ours,
but
they're...
they're
unwilling
to
recognize
that
everything,
as
the
court
said
in
exhibit
supply,
that
was
surrendered
is
necessarily
part
of
the
implied
disclaimer.
they
say,
well,
even
if
you
went
down
to
your
9
ph
in
warner-jenkinson,
as
long
as
you
could
show
that
you
could
have
claimed
10,
we
should
treat
that
the
same
as
if
you
did
claim
10.
we
think
that
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
by
the
public
from
the
prosecution
history
estoppel
are
not
that
loose.
but
we
do
think
the
court
of
appeals
went
too
far
in
saying
that
applicants
were
on
notice
that
an
absolute
bar
would
necessarily
apply
to
all
claims,
and
we
have
made
our
suggestions
about
burden
of
proof
and
presumptions
to
afford
further
protection
in
cases
where
the
applicant...
the
patentholder
can
show
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
treat--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we're
quite
worried
about
that.
we
caution
that
the
versatility
of
language
requires
skepticism
about
that,
but
we...
we
were
also
sensitive
about
the
difficulties
in
some
particular
areas
of
new
technology,
biotechnology,
and
the
like,
although
i
pressed
the
patent
office
and
they
couldn't
come
up
with
a
concrete
example.
