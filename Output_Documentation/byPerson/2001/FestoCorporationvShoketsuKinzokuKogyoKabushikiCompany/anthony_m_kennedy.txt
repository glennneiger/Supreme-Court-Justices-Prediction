justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
one
figure
that
out?
give
us
a...
an
example.
part
of
the
argument
is
this
is
very
difficult
to
figure
out,
that...
that
the
new
system
that's...
that's
been
brought
in
is...
is
as
complicated
to
administer
in...
in
the
courts
as...
as
the
old.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they're
saying
more
than
that.
they're
saying
they're
held
to
it
for
the
entire
element,
and
that's
where
i
have...
have
great
problems
with...
with
what
the
circuit
does.
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
a
vast
extension
over
what
we
thought
about
in
warner-jenkinson.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me...
can
you
give
me
some
sense
as
to
how
often
patent
applications
are
amended?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
mr.
bork
says
you're
just
going
to
transfer
now
the
load
to
the
appeals
within
the
patent
office
and
we're
going
to
have
this
long,
long
running
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that...
that's
a...
a
very
serious
consequence
if...
if
it
in
fact
will
follow.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
maybe
everybody
is
waiting
for
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
involves
the
patent
laws
of
the
united
states.
festo
corporation
is
the
petitioner
in
the
case.
it
claims
that
respondents
whom
we
call
smc
infringed
festo’s
patents.
the
festo
has
two
valid
patents
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
and
the
patents
cover
a
conveying
device
that
is
used
in
certain
machinery.
if
you
want
to
read
about
rodless
cylinders
that
is
a
very
interesting
subject.
smc
started
manufacturing
and
selling
a
similar
device
when
festo
suit
smc
for
infringement,
smc
said
well
our
device
is
different
from
yours.
festo
said
yes
it
is
different
but
in
such
trivial
respects,
that
it
is
an
equivalent
and
under
the
patent
laws,
an
equivalent
device
still
infringes.
smc
then
said
the
difference
in
your
device
and
our
device,
the
differences
you
say
you
are
so
trivial
but
the
very
difference
is
that
you
added
to
your
claims
when
you
amended
your
patent
application.
you
cannot
amend
an
application
in
order
to
obtain
the
patent
and
then
rely
on
the
doctrine
of
equivalents.
the
very
fact
that
you
amended
the
claim
in
question
means
that
you
are
barred
or
in
the
law's
term,
stopped
from
relying
on
the
doctrine
of
equivalents.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
agreed
with
smc
and
in
the
course
of
granting
judgment
for
smc,
the
court
adapted
a
new
rule,
which
is
that
once
a
claim
is
amended
in
the
patent
application
process,
the
patent
holder
is
stopped
from
relying
on
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
for
any
aspect
of
the
amended
claim
elements,
and
this
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
complete
bar
rule.
we
address
two
questions
in
this
case:
the
first
is
what
kind
of
amendments
brings
the
stop
of
doctrine
into
play
at
all.
on
this
point,
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
stop
of
doctrine
is
brought
into
play
by
amendments
related
to
any
of
the
law’s
requirements
for
patent
ability,
not
just
by
amendments
related
to
the
prior
art.
on
the
second
question
though
concerning
the
complete
bar
rule,
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
complete
bar
rule
is
inconsistent
with
our
previous
cases
and
with
the
purpose
underlying
prosecution
history
estoppel.
to
adapt
it
now
would
have
set
settled
expectation
of
countless
patent
owners
who
relied
on
our
earlier
cases
in
amending
their
patents.
in
the
course
of
our
opinion,
we
do
say
that
when
an
amendment
has
been
made
to
the
patent
application,
the
patent
holder
bares
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
amendment
was
not
made
for
a
reason
that
would
give
rise
to
an
estoppel.
this
is
the
approach
advanced
to
us
by
the
united
states
which
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
the
case
and
we
regard
that
approach
to
be
sound.
on
the
record
before
us,
we
cannot
say
that
festo
has
rebutted
the
presumption
that
the
equivalents
at
issue
have
been
surrendered
so
further
proceedings
are
in
order.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
federal
circuit
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance
can
determine
the
remaining
questions.
the
opinion
of
our
court
is
unanimous.
