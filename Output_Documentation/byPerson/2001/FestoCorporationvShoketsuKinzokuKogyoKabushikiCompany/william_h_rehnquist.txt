chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
00-1543,
festo
corporation
v.
shoketsu
kinzoku
kogyo
kabushiki.
i
hope
i
got
that
right.
[laughter]
mr.
bork.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
pto
have
authority
to
do
that
by
regulation
in
the
absence
of
congressional
authorization?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bork.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
wallace,
mr.
bork
says
the
government
has
changed
its
position
from
the
time
it
filed
its
brief
in
warner-jenkinson.
do
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
idea
of
estoppel,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
a
person
is
prevented
from
taking
contrary
positions,
and
it
seems
to
me
in
your
example
that
it's
not
necessarily
a
contrary
position.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
neustadt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
scarcely
an
encouraging
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
if...
if
we're
looking
for
some
sort
of
certainty
in
the
area,
to
say
that
the
federal
circuit
has
now
come
up
with
a
relatively
new
doctrine
but
they're
free
to
change
it
if
it
doesn't
work
is
not
the
most
auspicious
recommendation
for
that
doctrine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
federal
circuit
went
further
than
that
here.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
change
just
to
avoid
prior
art,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in...
in
the
john
deere
case,
certainly
the
term
patentability
was
used
just
for
that
purpose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
simply
an
interpretation
of
our
cases.
or
it
should
have
been
at
any
rate.
and
i
dare
say
we're
in
a
better
position
to
interpret
our
cases
than
the
federal
circuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
an...
i
think
i
agree
with
justice
ginsburg,
as
she
suggested.
i
think
there
is
an
inconsistency
between
warner-jenkinson
and
the
position
you're
taking.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
remand
in
warner-jenkinson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
neustadt.
mr.
bork,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bork.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
00-1543,
festo
corporation
versus
shoketsu
kinzoku
kogyo
kabushiki
limited
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
