wasn't
it
more,
mr.
bork,
than
just
a
presumption
if
you
couldn't...
i
thought
warner-jenkinson
said
where
you
do
not
establish
any
reason
for
the
amendment,
the
court
did
use
the
word
presume.
it
said
the
court
should
presume
that
the
patent
application
has
a
substantial
reason
relating
to
patentability.
and
then
the
following
sentence
is,
in
those
circumstances,
prosecution
history
estoppel
would
bar
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalents.
so,
that
sounds
to
me
like
an
absolute
bar
rule,
that
if
you
don't...
if
the
reason
is
unexplained,
the
consequence
is
a
complete
bar.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bork,
would
you...
would
you
comment
on
the
federal
circuit's
view
that
they
weren't
really
changing
anything,
but
they
had
two
inconsistent
lines
of
decisions?
one
was
the
complete
bar
rule
and
the
other
was
the
flexible
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
neustadt,
would
you...
would
you
tell
us
why
the
approach
of
a
complete
bar
is
consistent
with
the
approach
taken
in
warner-jenkinson
where
the
court
did
not
want
to
have
a
rigid...
a
rule
with
no
flexibility,
and
so
it
created
this
rebuttable
presumption?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
didn't
mean
it
to
be.
i
meant
to
focus
you
on
the
second
question
which
you
say
is
the
more
important
of
the
two,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
just
saying
that
in
warner-jenkinson,
the
court
didn't
want
to
freeze
things,
so
it
had
this
rebuttable
presumption.
you
do
want
to,
when
you
get
to
your
question
two,
say
absolute
bar.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
thought
everybody
agreed
that
the
question
was
open,
that
this
court
did
not
decide.
