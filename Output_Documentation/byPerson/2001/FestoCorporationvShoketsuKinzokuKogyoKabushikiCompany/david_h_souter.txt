is
there...
is
there
a
way
of
doing
this?
look,
the
federal
circuit
itself
thinks
that
its
rule
is
a
crude
effort
to
deal
with
a
problem
that
may
have
the
adverse
consequences
that...
that
mr.
bork
predicted.
and
if
so,
they'll
want
to
change
their
minds.
now,
is
there
a
way
under
the
law
that
they
could
have
the
authority
to
change
their
minds
if
it
turns
out
that
this
experiment
doesn't
work?
justice
david

mr.
wallace,
with
respect
to
that,
your
second
possibility,
the
second
kind
of
escape
hatch
for
the
patentholder,
as
i
understand
it,
relates
to
a
case
in
which,
in
effect,
it
was
impossible
to
be
any
more
precise,
to
exclude
any
more
precisely
than
they
did.
my
question
is,
doesn't
that
in
effect
invite
the
patentholder
to
make
that
kind
of
a
claim
in
every
case?
and
if
that
is,
in
fact,
going
to
be
an
exception
to
absolute
bar,
doesn't
it
mean
that
we're
going
to
litigate
it
in
every
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is...
is
that
really
so?
i
mean,
every
time
you
have
a
vague
claim,
you
at
least
have
an
opportunity
to
say,
well,
it
covers
more
than
a
contrasting
narrow
claim
would
be.
so,
i'm
not
sure
that
you
can
draw
this
categorical
distinction.
