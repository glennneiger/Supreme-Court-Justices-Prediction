is
it
clear
most
of
the
time,
mr.
bork,
whether
the
amendment
is
for
purposes
of
103,
111,
and
112?
can
you
pick
up
the
patent
history
and...
and
tell
at
a
glance
whether
it's
a
103
or
a
111
and
112
purpose
that
generated
the
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you're
the
applicant
and
you
get
that
response
from
the
patent
office,
during
the
course
of
the
amendment
might
you
not
rethink
and...
and
clarify
what
you're
doing
under
103
as
well?
that's
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
wasn't
that
the
argument
here
with
reference
to
the
seals
and
the
magnetized
or
demagnetized
cylinder?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
say
there's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let's
say
there's
an
amendment
under
103
where...
where
you
agree
that
there
can
be
an
estoppel.
should
there
be
a
presumption
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask?
i've
had
a
lot
of
trouble
understanding
this
patent,
to
be
very
honest
with
you.
some
patents
i
can
understand.
this
one
i
found
very
difficult.
and
one
of
your...
the
changes,
as
i
understand
it,
is
in
the
early
draft
of
the
claim
there
was
no
reference
to
the
nonmagnetic
material
that
was
used
in
the
tube
and
that
that
was
the...
that
was
one
of
the
changes
that...
that
was
made.
and
your
suggestion
is
that
was...
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject...
patentability.
it's
just
change
of
description
or
something
like
that,
if
i
understand
you.
but
the
patent
itself
seems
to
be
a
patent
on
a
magnetic
relationship
between
different
elements
of
the...
of
the
item,
and
just
at
first
blush,
it
seemed
to
me
that
a...
that
a...
an
element
that
described
a
nonmagnetic
material
would
be
rather
important.
and
your
position
is
it's
of
no
importance.
could
you
just
comment
a
little
bit
on
this
problem
for
me--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
i
can
get
a
better
understanding
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
in
the
stoll
patent
i
think,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bork,--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just
ask
you
a
question
about
they're
virtually
worthless
because
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
is
not
available
to
those
patentees?
that's...
that's
basically
the
point,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
the
one
thing
i
didn't...
there's
a
volume
of
briefs
in
the
file
here
and
i
can't
say
i've
read
them
all,
but
do
the
briefs
anywhere
tell
us
what
percentage
of
all...
successful
infringement
claims
rest
on
the
doctrine
of
equivalents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
your
assumption
is
that
a
very
significant
portion
must
be
based
on--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
there's
a
lot
of...
a
lot
of
cases
in
which
it's
just
an
infringement,
a
literal
infringement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
area
is
not
touched
by
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
it
didn't
foresee
that
there
wasn't
really
a
big
difference
between
nonmagnetic
material
and
magnetic
material.
i'm
not
using
the
right
words,
but
it
didn't
foresee
that
something
he...
they
described
as
significant
in
the
claims
was
really
not
significant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
just
interrupt
with
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
observation?
but...
but
the
result
of
your
rule
is
that
if
you
do
make
that
change
and
go
to...
to
glue,
you
lose
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
with
respect
to
that
element,
but
someone
who
originally
framed
the
claim
in
the
way
that
you
ended
up
with
does
not
have
the
same
opportunity
to
rely
on
equivalents
that
you
do.
would
you
comment
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
since
you
do
have
a
second
left,
what...
what
case
of
ours
does...
other
than
warner-jenkinson,
does
the
new
rule
repudiate?
