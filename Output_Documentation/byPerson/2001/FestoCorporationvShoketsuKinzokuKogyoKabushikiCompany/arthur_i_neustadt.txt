mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
i'd
like
to
direct
a
response
to
justice
breyer's
question
concerning
that
section
of
the
statute
that...
that
you
were
looking
for.
that's
112,
paragraph
6,
which
says
that
you
can
claim
the
function
of
an
element
and
you
get
protection
for
everything
that
has
that
function
if
it
is
the
same
as
what's
in
the
specification
or
its
equivalent.
next,
i'd
like
to
address
my
attention
to
justice
stevenson's
question
with
respect
to
literal
infringement
and
doctrine
of
equivalents
infringement.
we
were
faced
with
the
same
question
and
we
made
an
analysis
of
all
the
cases
that
were
decided
by
the
federal
circuit
in
the
year
2000.
we
found
that
there
were
31
cases
that
either
held
for
the
patentee
or
indicated
they
were
going
to
hold
for
the
patentee
with
respect
to
preliminary
injunction.
with
respect
to
those
cases,
all
but
four
were
literal
infringement.
so,
the
answer
to
your
question,
for
the
year
2000,
is
that
27
of
the
31
cases
were
directed
to
literal
infringement
and
not...
not
doctrine
of
equivalents
infringement.
and
you
must
keep
in
mind
that
the
federal
circuit
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
the
doctrine
of
equivalents,
didn't
rule
on
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
in
general.
they
only
ruled
on
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
with
respect
to
when
a
patentee
switches
from
one
position
to
another.
he
starts
with
one
claim.
for
some
reason
he
sees
that
in
order
to
get
his
patent,
he
is
going
to
have
to
narrow.
a
good
example
is
the
example
that
festo
uses,
going
from
adhesives
to
glue.
you
claim
adhesives
broadly
when
you
start.
you're
going
to
get
protection
for
all
adhesives.
then
you
find
there's
prior
art
or
something
else,
maybe
your
specification
isn't
enabled,
and
you
say
i'm
going
to
have
to
go
to
glue.
what
the
federal
circuit
says
for
that
particular
claim
element,
when
you
go
from
adhesives
to
glue,
you
are
telling
the
public
that
you're
going
to
rely--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--yes.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
that
is
correct.
this
was
a
point
that
this
court
addressed
in
exhibit
supply
and
that
is
because
claims
are
not
interpreted
just
as
they
stand.
they're
interpreted
in
accordance
with
their
prosecution
history.
where
you
have
an
original
claim
that
has
no
prosecution
history,
then
it's
much
tougher
for
the
public
to
read
and
figure
out
what...
what
glue
or
adhesives
mean.
but
where
you
have
this
change
from
one
position
to
another,
a
change
that
every
patent
attorney
resists,
then
the
federal
circuit
says
this
is
a
narrowing
that
the
public
is
entitled
to
rely
upon.
so,
there...
there
is
a
very
significant
change
even
though
you
have
the
exact
same
words.
to
refer
to
mr.
breyer's
question
about
whether
or
not
the
federal
circuit
has
the
power
to
change
what
they've
done,
the
answer
is,
of
course,
prosecution
history
estoppel
is
judge-made
law.
there
is
no
statute
concerning
it.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
be
changed,
and
i
don't
think
there's
anything
retroactive
because
the
federal
circuit
decision
was
entirely
consistent
with
this
court's
precedent
in
exhibit
supply
and
also
warner-jenkinson.
in
exhibit
supply,
this
court
said
that
where
a
patentee
makes
a
change
to
avoid
prior
art
for
that
particular
element,
he
disclaims
and
abandons
everything
between--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
what
they
did
was
follow
what
this
court
said
in
warner-jenkinson
concerning
what
relates
to
patentability.
the
court
in
warner-jenkinson
said...
this
court...
that...
that
we
have
used
this
with
respect
to
prior
art,
citing
exhibit
supply,
but
they
didn't
say
it
is
limited
to
prior
art.
what
the
federal
circuit
then
said--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--for
prior
art?
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
what
the
federal
circuit
did
was
they
said...
and
there
was
almost
virtually
unanimity
on
the
court,
11
to
1...
that
when
you
make
this
narrowing
for
a
purpose
related
to
patentability
or
for
a
statutory
requirement
for
patentability,
then
the
public
can
view
that
and
recognize
and
rely
upon
it.
so,
the
extension
from,
if
you
will,
102
and
103
to
112
was
of
very
little
extension
at
all.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
yes.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
yes,
yes.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
well,
112
is
not
just
a
matter
of
form.
112
is
addressed
to
some
of
the
most
important
issues
for
a
patent
application,
such
as
whether
or
not
the
application
enables
the
invention.
the
quid
pro
quo
for
the
public
with
respect
to
giving
the
exclusivity
to
the
patentee
is
they
get
an
enabling
disclosure.
if
there
is
no
enabling
disclosure,
then
the
public
gets
nothing.
enabling
disclosure
is
112,
so
112
is
just
not
form.
if
you
are
talking
about
form
and
clarification,
usually
when
you
clarify
a
claim,
you
don't
narrow
it
and
so
the
result
is
that
would
not
be
controlled
by
the
federal
circuit
rule.
what
the
federal
circuit--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--usually
when
a
patent
attorney
wants
to...
is
concerned
with
narrowing
his
claim,
he
doesn't
want
to
narrow
his
claim
because
he
gets
less
for
his
client.
he
will
try
to
clarify
it
in
a
way
that
doesn't
narrow,
if
that
is
the
examiner's
concern.
so,
usually
clarifications
are
not
narrowings
and
are
not
affected
by
the
federal
circuit
rule.
what
the
federal
circuit
issue
is...
is
directed
to
is
actually
changing
a
position
for
a
statutory
requirement
for
patentability.
that
can
be
prior
art.
it
can
be
non-enabling
disclosure.
for
example,
this
court
has
held
in
crawford
v.
heysinger
in
the
1800's...
applied
prosecution
history
estoppel
to
a
inoperability
rejection
which
was
a
112
rejection.
and
so,
this
is
the
reason
why
the
federal
circuit
had
very
little
difficulty
and
ended
up
with
an
11-to-1
vote
when
they
said
that,
yes,
amendments
are
not
limited
to
avoid
prior
art.
they
cover
other
instances
where
you
narrow.
and
the
key...
the
key
is
narrowing.
patent
attorneys
hate
to
narrow.
it
gives
their
clients
less
protection.
they
don't
want
to
narrow
unless
the
only
choice
is
not
getting
a
patent.
so,
they
put
that
narrowing
language
in
there.
and
all
that
the
federal
circuit
is
saying
when
they
put
that
narrowing
language
in
there,
they
should
be
held
to
it.
and
the
reason
they're
held
to
it
is
because
of
the
public--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--in...
in
warner-jenkinson
this
court
said
that
if
we
do
not
know
the
reason
for
the
amendment,
we're
going
to
presume
that
it
relates
to
patentability,
and
when
we
make
that
presumption,
if
it's
not
rebutted,
it
will
act
as
a
bar.
so,
this
court
in
warner-jenkinson
set
forth
a
complete
bar.
complete
bar
is
nothing
new.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
the...
the
additional
rule
relates
to
the
fact
that
in
the
federal
circuit,
not
in
this
court,
there
was
what
was
called
a
flexible
bar
rule,
and
what
they
did
was
if
you
initially
claimed
glue
and
came
back
to
adhesives
and
then...
i'm
sorry...
you
claimed
adhesives
and
then
you
had
to
narrow
it
to
glue,
then
in
a
lawsuit
you
found
someone
using
adhesives,
you
would
then
say,
well,
my
glue
is
really
the
same
as
adhesives
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalents.
and
the
federal
circuit
in
this
decision
is
saying
that
you
can't
do
that.
but
previously
the
federal
circuit
had
the
flexible
bar
rule,
and
the
flexible
bar
rule
said
that
if
you
went
from
adhesives
to
glue,
and
you
didn't
have
to
go
all
that
way
to
glue...
maybe
you
could
have
stopped
somewhere
in
between...
they
say
you
can
then
look
at
where
you
might
have
been
able
to
stop.
this
is
in
the
intel
brief,
could
have,
should
have,
and
would
have.
and
they
say
we
can
take
it
back
to
something
in
between
adhesives
and
glue.
and
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the
public
has
no
notice
of
what
the
claim
covers.
someone
out
there
who
wants
to
innovate
in
the
area
between
glue
and
adhesives
has
to
know
what
he
can
do,
and
the
federal
circuit
rule
enables
them
now
to
say
that,
yes,
that
claim
means
glue
and
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
something
if
we
don't
use
glue.
and--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--the...
the
sg's
test
and
also
the
ieee
test
that
you
referred
to...
the
se
says...
and
his...
his
rule
is
a
little
better
than
the
flexible
bar
rule.
the
sg
says
we're
going
to
have
a
complete
bar
presumption,
and
the
presumption
is
going
to
have
to
be
overcome
by
the
patentee,
and
he's
going
to
have
to
show
that
this
was
unforeseeable.
but
this
rule
has
all
of
the
uncertainties
that
create
all
the
problems
with
the
flexible
bar
rule,
and
therefore
it
really
is
not
an
improvement.
the
court's
decision
has
been
in
effect
for
13
months.
it's
really
worked
just
fine.
there
have
been
really
no
problems.
patent
prosecution
hasn't
changed
at
all.
there
haven't
been
any
cases
that
follow
that--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--i
don't
think
there
are
any
statistics.
patent
applications...
i'd
say
50
percent,
maybe
more.
but...
but
that
doesn't
distinguish
between
amendments
and
narrowing
amendments.
usually
it's
the
narrowing
amendments
that...
that
trigger
the
federal
circuit
rule.
and
with
respect
to--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--no.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
we
haven't
notice
that
consequence
and
that
just
isn't
happening
in
the
pto.
you
see
nothing
in
the
sg
pto
brief.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
the...
that
may
be
but
the
federal
circuit
has...
has
been
applying
this
case
in
all
of
its
cases.
it's
simplified
a
lot
of
the
decisions.
what
it's
meant
is
that
patent
attorneys
can
now
advise
their
clients
that,
yes,
you
can
do
this;
no,
you
can't
do
that.
whereas,
under
the
flexible
bar
rule,
they
were
unable
to
do
so.
in...
in...
when
you
claim,
the
claiming
is
central
to...
to
the
system...
to
our
system.
the
applicant
has
a
disclosure.
from
that
disclosure,
he
can
decide
what
it
is
he
wants
to
claim,
and
he
can
claim
various
elements
and
he
usually
does
it
as
broadly
as
possible.
the
examiner
then
examines
the
claim
on
exactly
what
he
claims,
not
the
disclosure.
the
patentee
is
master
of
his
claims.
he
decides
what
the
issue
is
going
to
be.
if
the
examiner
rejects
the
claim
that
was
selected
by
the
patentee,
then...
then
the
patentee
or
the
applicant
says,
well,
there's
nothing
i
can
do
now.
i
either
have
a
choice
of
not
getting
a
patent
or
i've
got
to
limit
my
patent.
so,
he
comes
in
and
he
limits
his
patent.
he
goes
from
adhesives
to
glue.
that
patent
issues
and
the
public
can
then
look
at
it.
the
patent
tells
you
what
you
can't
do,
but
more
importantly,
it
tells
you
what
you
can
do.
and
the
public
can
do
no
better
than
look
at
the
claim
and
its
prosecution
history,
and
when
it
does
that,
it
can
look
and
decide
what
it
can
do.
and
this
results
in
increased
innovation.
this
court
in
markman,
interpreting
claims,
said
that
claims,
if
they
are
uncertain...
and
this
was
the
need
for
judges
rather
than
juries
to
interpret
them.
if
they're
uncertain,
they
foreclose
an
area
of
technology.
if
you
have
uncertainty
between
here
and
here,
no
one
will
innovate
in
that
area
because
they
recognize,
if
they're
successful,
they're
just
going
to
be
sued
for
infringement
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalents.
they
may
have
an
injunction
entered
against
them,
which
is
going
to
stop
their
production
line,
and
they're
going
to
have
to
give
back
profits
which
the
patentee
is
going
to
ask
for
in
lost
profits.
so,
everything
really
turns
on
the
claims,
and
the
patent
attorney
has
the
tools
to
do
it.
he
can
use
112,
paragraph
6.
he
always
claims
as
broadly
as
possible.
all
that
the
federal
circuit
has--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--the
difference...
the
difference
between
that
is
that
the
federal
circuit
has
limited
its
holding
to
the
time
when
the
patent
applicant
goes
from
one
claim
to
another
claim
where
he
narrows
the
claim.
if
he
doesn't
narrow
the
claim,
there's
no
problem
with
the
doctrine
of
equivalents.
also,
if
he
doesn't
narrow
an
element,
there's
no
doctrine
of
equivalents.
all
that
the
federal
circuit
has
said
here
is
that
the
balance
shifts
with
respect
to
the
point
that
you're
referring
to
when
the
patent
applicant,
with
his
eyes
open,
knows
that
he's
got
a
problem
and
he's
going
to
have
to
narrow.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
well,
that's
not
an
issue
before
the
court.
but
the...
the
federal
circuit
does
restrict
the
doctrine
in...
doctrine
of
equivalents
in
other
areas.
for
example,
you
can
have
an
argument
that
you
make
in
your...
in
your
amendment,
and
that
argument
can
then
be
used
against
you
as
an
estoppel.
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
federal
circuit
also
handled
an
issue
where
an
applicant
will
disclose,
say,
three
things,
a,
b,
and
c,
and
he'll
only
claim
a.
and
then
he'll
come
back
and
he'll
say,
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalents,
a
covers
b
and
c.
and
the
federal
circuit
deals
with
that.
but
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
what
the
federal
circuit
has
done
is
they've
handled
the
exact
issue
that
this
court
handled
in
exhibit
supply
and
in
warner-jenkinson.
and
that
is
that
the
balance
shifts
when
you
make
an
amendment
that
relates
to
patentability
and--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--yes.
the
court
in
warner-jenkinson
was
trying
to
decide
between
amendments
that
relate
to
patentability
and
amendments
that
do
not
relate
to
patentability.
and
the
petitioner
in
that
case
was
asserting
that
that
distinction
was
not
an
important
distinction.
the
court
in
warner-jenkinson
said
we're
not
going
to
have
a
bright
line
rule
that
this
complete
bar
is
going
to
apply
to
every
single
amendment.
it's
only
going
to
apply
to
those
amendments
that
relate
to
patentability.
and
the
court
said
in
the
past
we've
used
prior
art
as
relating
to
patentability,
but
the
court
did
not
limit
it
to
that.
the
federal
circuit
then
came
back
and
one
of
the
questions
they
had,
they
said,
is
102
and...
is
relates
to
patentability
under
this
court's
decision
limited
to
102
and
103.
and
this
is
question
one
in
the
federal
circuit.
and
the
federal
circuit
held
virtually
unanimous,
11
to
1,
that
relates
to
patentability
is
not
limited
to
102
and
103.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
well,
i
think
the...
the
federal
circuit
was
saying
that
the
cases
of
this
court
were
not
absolutely
controlling,
but
what
they
would
do
would
be
consistent
with
this
court.
and
that
was...
that
was
the
effect
of
their
holding.
but
if
you
look
carefully...
look
more
carefully
at
this
court's
cases,
this
court's
cases
we
submit
in
our
brief
actually
do
control
and
would
have
necessitated
the
federal
circuit
to
reach
that
verdict.
this
court,
as
i
said--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--an
inconsistency?
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
i
don't
think
so
because
the...
the--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--yes.
the
remand
in
warner-jenkinson,
as
specifically
defined
there,
was
for
the
federal
circuit
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
amendment
that
was
made
to
change
the
ph
to
6
related
to
patentability.
the
petitioner
was
saying
you
don't
have
to
determine
whether
it
relates
to
patentability.
the
remand
said,
federal
circuit,
you
now
look
and
tell
us
whether
or
not
it
relates
to
patentability,
and
that's
what
the
federal
circuit
did.
and
then
as
they
had
a
few
more
cases
after
warner-jenkinson...
and
they
had...
they
had
disputes
among
the
judges...
they
said
we're
going
to
resolve
this
in
this...
in
this
case.
and
they
not
only
said
they're
going
to
rehear
it
en
banc,
but
they
said
we're
going
to
have
five
questions.
and
the
first
question
was...
was
justice
ginsburg's
question.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
the
complete
bar,
yes.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
the
absolute
bar
was
in
warner-jenkinson.
in
warner-jenkinson,
this
court
said
if
the
amendment
relates
to
patentability,
then
there's
going
to
be
an
absolute
bar.
the
words
this
court
used
was
bar.
they
didn't
use
absolute
bar
because
a
bar
is
a
bar.
but...
but...
and
this
court
was
just
following
exhibit
supply
which
had
that
same
bar
in
that.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
the
federal
circuit
said
that
their
decision
was
not
controlled
by
exhibit
supply.
both
our
side
and
the
government
side
said
that
it
is
controlled
by
exhibit
supply
and
that
the
federal
circuit
would
have
had
to
have
reached
that
conclusion
anyway.
and...
and
the...
the
very
plain
language
of
exhibit
supply
is
that
when
a
patentee
chooses
to
go
from
the
claim
as
unamended
to
make
a
narrow
limitations
in
there,
there's
a
complete
bar
with
respect
to
the
amended
element.
and
exhibit
supply,
of
course,
talks
about
there
is
an
abandonment
and
disclaimer
of
everything
between
the
element
as
unamended
and
as
amended.
and
to--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--yes.
it's
not
changes.
it's
the
narrowing
changes.
you
can
make
a
lot
of
changes.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
there
are
very
few
changes
where
you
have
significant
narrowing
that
do
not
relate
to
patentability.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
oh,
well--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--if
you
take
out
narrowing,
you
can
have
a
lot
of
changes.
for
example,
you
may
file
an
application
and
then
broaden
your
claim.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
and
this
is
why
the
federal
circuit
had
such
virtual
unanimity
because--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--i
think
in
warner-jenkinson
the
subject
wasn't
specifically
addressed.
the
court
recognized
that
you
have
narrowing
changes
with
respect
to
prior
art.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
yes.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
to...
to
a
certain
extent,
the...
the
federal
circuit
rule
is
even
narrower
than...
than
warner-jenkinson
because
this
court
in
warner-jenkinson
did
not
refer
to
narrowing.
it
just
referred
to
amendments
that
relate
to
prior
art,
and
there
must
have
been
an
implicit
assumption
that
that
was...
that
was
narrowing.
the
federal
circuit,
since
they
hear
a
lot
of
patent
cases,
focused
more
in
on
the
fact
that
it
really
wasn't
the
fact
that
it
was
prior
art.
what
you
wanted
to
get
at
was
important
changes,
and
they...
they
used
the
language
statutory
requirements
of
patentability.
for
example,
one
of
the
most
important
things
is
your
claim
being
supported
by
the
disclosure.
you
can't
claim
what
you
don't
invent.
so,
if
your
claim
is
real
broad,
the
examiner
says,
but
you've
only
disclosed
this,
so
you
can't
foreclose
all
of
this.
and
so
then
you
have
to
narrow
it
down
to
this.
and
that's
a
112
change,
and
a
112
change
is
just
as
important
as
a
102
and
a
103
change.
and
so
the
federal
circuit
says
if
it's
for
a
statutory
requirement
for
patentability.
and
these
are
not
trivial
changes.
a
patent
attorney,
when
an
examiner
makes
a
change...
a
suggested
change,
says,
well,
how
can
i
do
that
without
narrowing.
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
clarity.
you
can
make
changes
with
respect
to
clarity.
maybe
the
examiner
likes
12
feet
rather
than
144
inches.
maybe
there
are
other
things
that
he
thinks
will
be
more
clear.
as
long
as
they're
not
narrowing,
the
patent
attorney
is
happy
to
make
them,
but
as
soon
as
he...
he
narrows,
he
knows
that
he's
getting
his
client
less.
with
respect
to
foreseeability,
i
just
wanted
to
make
one
comment.
patent
attorneys,
when
they
draft
broad
claims,
they
draft
broad
claims
because
they
don't
know
what
is
going
to
happen
in
the
future.
they
want
the
broad
claim
because
if
something
happens
in
the
future,
they're
going
to
be
covered
for
it.
also,
the
patent
attorney
doesn't
know
everything
that's
happened
in
the
past,
and
so
he
wants
the
broad
claim
because
he
gets
much
better
coverage.
for
example,
you
don't
want
to
go
to...
from
adhesives
to
glue,
because
if
you
do
that...
i'm
sorry.
