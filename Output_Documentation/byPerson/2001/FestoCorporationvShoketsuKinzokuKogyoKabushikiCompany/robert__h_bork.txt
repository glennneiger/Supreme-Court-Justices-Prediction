mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
refer
to
them
as
smc.
[laughter]
the
federal
circuit's
rules
in
this
case
ought
to
be
reversed
because
it
flatly
contradicts
this
court's
decision
in
warner-jenkinson,
and
furthermore,
it
radically
undermines
the
patent
system.
i
think
warner-jenkinson
should
be
reaffirmed
because
it's
in
keeping
with
the
patent
act,
with
the
goals
and
policies
of
the
patent
system,
and
because
it
is
much
fairer
than
the
harsh
inequities
of
this
new
rule
which
this
case
presents
a
prime
example.
warner...
let
me
discuss
the
crucial
differences
between
warner-jenkinson
and
the
federal
circuit's
new
rules.
in
the
first
place,
warner-jenkinson
holds
that
prosecution
history
estoppel
arises
only
when
an
amendment
to
a
patent
surrenders
subject
matter...
and
clearly
surrenders
it...
in
order
to
achieve
patentability.
the
federal
circuit
holds
to
the
contrary
that
any
narrowing
amendment,
regardless
of
the
reason
for
it,
creates
prosecution
history
estoppel.
second,
the
warner-jenkinson
case
holds
that
the
reason
for
an
amendment
determines
whether
an
estoppel
is
created.
the
federal
circuit
denies
that
and
holds
that
the
reason
is
irrelevant,
and
if
an
amendment
has
the
narrowing
effect,
intended
or
not,
it
creates
a
complete
estoppel.
thus,
if
the
patent
examiner
said
he
found
the
claims
to
be
imprecise
and
the
applicant
made
an
amendment
to
clarify
what
the
examiner
thought
was
imprecise,
that
might
be
held
to
be
a
narrowing
amendment
and
the
patent
would
be
unenforceable.
and
that
is
what
happened
to
festo
in
this
case.
and
those
results
cannot
be
squared
with
warner-jenkinson.
third,
the
federal
circuit
holds
that
an
amendment
creates
an
estoppel
if
it
applies
to
any
of
the
statutory
requirements
for
obtaining
a
patent,
not
just
patent...
not
just
patentability
as
defined
by
the
patent
act,
but
any
of
the
requirements
for
obtaining
a
patent.
now,
the
patent
act
makes
clear
a
distinction
between
patentability
and
other
requirements.
sections
101
through
103
come
under
the
heading
of
patentability
of
inventions,
and
they
state
the
substantive
requirements
for
getting
a
patent.
the
invention
must
be
new
and
useful.
it
must
be
not
found
in
the
prior
art,
and
it
must
not
be
obvious.
those
are
the
only
elements
of
patentability
known
in
the
law.
and
this
court's
opinion
in
graham
against
john
deere
confirms
that.
no
other
requirement
of
the
statute
relates
to
patentability.
the
federal
circuit
holds
to
the
contrary,
that
an
amendment
affecting
any
of
the
statutory
requirements
for
getting
a
patent
may
generate
estoppel,
and
those
requirements
include
sections
111
and
112
of
the
act.
but
those
sections
relate
to
the
form
of
the
application
and
not
to
the
subject
matter
sought
to
be
patented.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
one
can.
for
example,
in
this
case
you'll
see
in
the
stoll
patent...
there
are
two
patents,
of
course,
in
play
here,
the
stoll
patent
and
the
carroll
patent.
in
this
case,
the
patent
examiner
says
that
he
objects
on
the
grounds
that
the
claim
is
stated
in
an
improper
form,
is
multiply
dependent,
and
also
that
it's
imprecise.
he's
not
sure
what
it
means.
now,
that
is
quite
clear
that
those
are
111
and
112
objections,
not
to
the
subject
matter
sought
to
be
patented.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
if
the...
if
the
applicant
decides
to
amend
in
a
way
that
surrenders
subject
matter,
it
disclaims
subject
matter,
the
fact
that
the
process
began
with
a...
with
the
examiner's
on
grounds
of
form
doesn't
affect
it.
if
he
surrenders
subject
matter,
that
subject
matter
is
gone
and
the
equivalents
to
it
are
gone
too.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
was
an
argument
to
that
effect,
but
if
you
look
at
the
patent...
at
the
prosecution
history
which
is
of
both
the
stoll
and
the
carroll
patents,
which
are
in
the
volume
2
of
the
transcript,
there
is
no
abandonment
of
any
subject
matter.
in
the
stoll
patent,
there
is
no
abandonment
of
subject
matter.
in
the
carroll
patent,
there
is.
however,
the
subject
matter
which
was
abandoned
had
no
relevance
to
the
lawsuit.
it
wasn't
what
was...
what
was
sued
on,
so
that
there
is,
in
operational
terms,
no
disclaimer
or
surrender
of
subject
matter
in
either
of
these
patents.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
justice
o'connor,
i
think
they're
much
too
narrow.
the
only
rationale
that
makes
any
sense
as
to
a
flexible
bar
proposal
or
any
bar
proposal
is
that
if
you've
disclaimed
something,
then
the
equivalent
of
subject
matter...
the
equivalents
to
the
disclaimed
subject
matter
are
barred
by
estoppel,
but
other
equivalents
that
don't
go
to
what
was
surrendered
are
not
barred.
therefore,
the...
the
rule
of
the...
the
bar,
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
bar,
relates
closely
to
the
question...
the
first
question
presented
in
this
case--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--as
to
what
was
surrendered.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
a
presumption...
if
there
is
a
clear
surrender,
there's
no
presumption.
it's...
it's
a...
it's
a
waiver.
it's...
you've
estopped
yourself.
if
it's
unclear
what...
why
you
have
done
it,
then
this
court
in
warner-jenkinson
says
there
be
a
remand
under
a
presumption
that
what
you
did
was
for
purposes
of
patentability,
what
you
surrendered
was
for
purposes
of
patentability,
and
if
you
cannot
rebut
that
presumption,
then
you
lose.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
well,
consequence
is
a
bar
as
to
that.
yes,
as
to
that
area.
but
i
guess
i
perhaps
didn't
express
myself
well.
if
the
appellate
court,
this
court,
looks
and
says,
i
don't
know
the
reason...
as
in
warner-jenkinson,
it
was
unclear
why
there
was
a
lower
limit
of
ph
6
set
on
that
process...
i
don't
know...
i
don't
know
why
you
amended
to
set
that
lower
limit,
there
is
a
presumption
that
you
did
it
for
a
reason
related
to
patentability,
which
would
create
a
complete
bar.
however,
on
remand,
you
get
a
chance
to
rebut
that
presumption
with
evidence.
if
you
don't
rebut
it,
it's
a
bar.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
the
fact--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--well,
there
are
a
couple
of
responses
to
that,
justice
breyer.
in
the
first
place,
let
me
say
that
the
solution
the
federal
circuit
has
devised
is...
doesn't
relate
to
the
problem.
if
the
problem
is
the
unworkability
of
the
equivalents
test,
then
the
answer
is
to
abolish
equivalents,
not
to...
and
that
doesn't
depend
on
whether
or
not
there's
been
an
amendment.
and
if
you're
going
to
abolish
equivalents,
the
way
to
do
it,
so
that
you
don't
have
this
terrible
retroactive
effect,
is
to
have
the
patent
and
trademark
office
engage
in
a
rulemaking
function,
a
rulemaking
which
has
a
prospective
effect
only,
or
have
congress
sit
down
and
do
a
rule...
legislate
that
has
a
prospective
effect
only.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
has
authorization
to
do...
to
make
rules
of
that
sort,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
on
the...
on
the
question
that...
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--well--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--that
is
true,
but
what
they
have
suggested
in
effect
is
that
the
lawyer
put
into
the
literal
claims
he
files
a
claim
for
all
the
equivalents
that
he
can
foresee.
now,
he
can't
foresee
most
of
the
equivalents,
and
if
he
did
that,
i
think
you'd
have
a
patent
claim
that
would
look
roughly
like
the
tax
code.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
function,
way
and
result.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
you're
referring,
i
think,
justice
breyer,
to
the
testing
of...
for
equivalents
called
function,
way
and
result?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
if
you
do
that,
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
you've
solved
the
problem
of
unworkability.
i
don't
think
it's
unworkable
in
the
first
place,
but
i
don't
think
you've
solved
the
problem
of
the
litigation
that's
going
to
take
place
and
the
difficulty
judges
are
going
to
have
in
distinguishing
the
case
that
is
covered
from
the
case
that
is
not
covered.
i
think
it's
exactly
the
same
problem
as
you'd
get
with
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalents.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
the--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--the
festo
patent
specified
a
magnetized
material
in
the
tube,
and
smc
used
a
aluminum
alloy.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
and
smc
used
a
aluminum
alloy,
which
is
not
magnetizable
material.
however,
it
does
conduct
magnetism
well
enough...
very
slightly,
but
well
enough...
to
complete
the
circuit
and
to
do
what
the
festo
patent
does
so
that
it
is
an
equivalent
in
that
sense
to
the
magnetizable
sleeve.
if
it
were
pure
aluminum,
it
wouldn't
conduct
the
magnetism,
but
it
isn't.
it's
an
alloy.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
i
would...
i
would
point
to
the
sealing
rings
and
the
magnetizable--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--i
beg
your
pardon?
you
defined
it
this
way
and
they
didn't
follow
it?
they
did
follow
it.
the
only
difference
between
their...
our
claim
said
four
rings:
two
guide
rings
and
two
sealing
rings.
they
had
two
guide
rings
and
one
sealing
ring.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
outside.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
used--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--they
used
one
ring
which
performed
exactly
the
same
function.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--i
don't
know
that
they--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--if
they
put
before
the
jury
or
the
judge
the
question
of
whether
a
narrowing
has
taken
place,
they'll
be
litigating
just
as
much
and
there
will
be
just
as
much
uncertainty
as
there
is
on
whether
this
thing
is
substantially
the
same
as
that
thing.
you...
this...
one
thing
this
new
rule
does
not
do
is
eliminate
uncertainty.
in
fact,
we
will...
it
just
shifts
the
area
of
litigation,
so
that
i
don't
think
that
anything
is
solved
by
this.
it
just...
nothing
is
solved
by
it
and
you
pay
an
enormous
price
in
terms
of
future
patents.
if
you
look
at
future
patents,
the
future
patentee
knows
he's
not
going
to
get
the
same
protection
he
had
before
because
if
he
dares
to
amend...
and
almost
all
patents
are
amended.
it's
just
inevitable.
that's
the
way...
that's
the
way
the
process
goes.
if
he's...
if
he
amends
and
if
an
amendment
is
requested
by
the
examiner,
he
can
either
refuse
it
and
appeal.
that
adds
about
4
years
to
the
time,
to
the
2
years
the
prosecution
history
usually
takes.
now,
the
patent
started
running
when
you
filed.
so,
now
you've
lost
6
years,
the
most
valuable
years
under
your
patent.
and
nobody
is
going
to
like
that.
or
he
can
turn
to
the
trade
secret
system,
or
he
can
file
a
claim
so
narrow
that
they...
they
don't
fully
protect
what
he's
invented
but
also
that
don't
require
amendments.
the...
if
you...
if
you
get
patents
of
that
sort,
which
are
of
very
little
value,
you
don't
protect
the
innovation
function
that
patents
are
supposed
to
protect.
pfizer
and
other
amici
have
pointed
out
that
to
get
a
drug
to
market
costs
in
excess
of
$100
million.
nobody
is
going
to
spend
over
$100
million
to
commercialize
a
product
that
cannot
be
protected.
so,
you've
done...
you've
done
an
enormous
amount
of
damage
to
the
innovation
process
in
this
thing.
worse--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--the
people
who
are
really
hard
hit
are
the
people,...
the
1,200,000
patents
that
are
outstanding
now
because
those
people
had
no
warning.
when
they...
when
they
got
their
patents,
amendments
were
freely
made,
and
that
was
just
the
way
it
worked.
the
examiner
and
the
patent
attorney
sat
down
and
they
exchanged
views
and
they
worked
it
out
and
they
amended
to
satisfy
the
examiner.
now
all
of
those
patents
are
virtually
worthless,
which
is
a--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--that's
right.
well,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don't
recall
that
the
briefs
ever
do
tell
us
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
yes.
well--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--that's
true,
but
if
a...
if
a--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--no,
but
if
a
copyist
wants
to
avoid
literal
infringement,
he
takes
an
amended
element
and
alters
it
slightly,
and
he's
home
free
under
the
federal
circuit
rule.
and
that's
what
happened
here.
you
have
a
device
which,
for
all
practical
purposes,
is
identical
to
the
festo
patents
and
has
now
destroyed
the
value
of
the
festo
patents
because
festo
didn't
foresee
back
in
the
1980's,
when
it
got
these
patents,
that
the
federal
circuit
was
going
to
change
the
law
as
it
has
in
1997.
and
i--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--well,
it's
significant
enough.
the...
the
fact
is
that
the
aluminum
alloy...
the
alloy
makes
it
perform
the
same
function
as
the
magnetizable
material,
and
what
they
didn't
foresee
was
that
the
law
was
going
to
change
so
that
the
amendment
was
going
to
destroy
their
patent.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
they
had
two
decisions
that
in...
in
some
sense
were
regarded
as...
they
claimed
to
be
complete
bar
rules.
i
think
that's
a...
that's
quite
a
stretch.
if
you
look
at
the
uninterrupted
supreme
court
precedent,
there
is
no
case
like
what
the
federal
circuit
has
done
now.
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
has
been
around
for
over
150
years,
and
this
court
has
consistently
applied
it.
and
they...
there
was
no
complete
bar
in
the
supreme
court
jurisprudence.
i
don't
think
there's
much...
any
complete
bar
in
the
federal
circuit
jurisprudence
either,
but
whatever
it
was,
everybody
went
forward
on
the
understanding
that
the
kind
of
law
that
was
reaffirmed
in
warner-jenkinson
was
the
law.
and
that's
why
i
find
it
particularly
odd
that
the
government
should
say
that
those
people
are
charged
with
knowledge
back
then
of
what
was
going
to
happen
now.
and
that
is
doubly
odd
because
the
government
in
warner-jenkinson
filed
a
brief
taking
the
position
that
we
take
here
today,
and
now
they
say
that
we
should
have
known
better.
they
didn't
know
better.
i
don't
know
how
we
would
know
better.
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think...
i
think
they're
two
words
for
the
same
thing.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
wish
to
address
this
question
of
narrowing.
the
concept
of
narrowing
has
no
limits.
in
this
case,
the
stoll
patent
moved
one
element...
an
element
from
one
claim
to
another.
no
change,
just
moved
from
one
claim
to
another.
that
was
held
to
be
a
narrowing.
now,
if
that's
a
narrowing,
nothing
is
unrelated
to
patentability.
that...
that's
the
extreme
to
which
the
federal
circuit
takes
this
case.
now,
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
the
government
i
think
didn't
quote
you
the
relevant
language
from
their
brief.
they
approvingly
quoted
as
the
law
in
warner-jenkinson...
that
is,
in
filing
in
warner-jenkinson...
whenever
a
prosecution
history
estoppel
is
invoked,
there's
a
limitation
to
infringement
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalents.
a
close
examination
must
be
made
as
to
not
only
what
was
surrendered
but
also
the
reason
for
such
surrender.
that's
the
position
that
the...
this
court
adopted
in
warner-jenkinson.
it's
the
position
that
festo
takes
before
this
court
today.
i
should
say
that
i
don't...
when
i
answered
you,
justice
o'connor,
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
a
limitation
was
the
same
as
an
amendment.
it's
just
a
statement
of
the
claim.
a
limitation
is
where
the
claim
is
when
you
first
make
it.
this
case...
if
what
happened
to
festo
here
and
what's
going
to
happen
to
other
patentholders
continues,
this
case,
were
it
not
done
by
a
court,
were
it
done
by
any
other
agency,
would
be
a
taking
under
the
constitution.
and
that's
why
it's
important
that
you...
this
court
not
approve
a
retroactive
application
of
this
drastic
new
rule
but
require
that
it
be
done
by
congress
or
by
rulemaking
by
the
patent
and
trademark
office.
thank
you.

the
doctrine

there's
an
argument
there
about...
they
don't
call
it
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
then,
but
there's
an
argument
there
about
whether
something
fell
under

patent
claim

they
say

it's
