justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
the
federal
circuit
is
supposed
to
be
an
expert
in
this
and
they
say
that
inventors
or
people
who
are
trying
to
invent
things
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
read
the
claims,
and
that's
it.
and
if
you
didn't
make
your
claim
properly,
particularly
when
you
had
a
second
chance,
that's
your
problem,
and
any
other
system...
any
other
system
is
going
to
really
go
back
to
what
used
to
be
called
central
claiming
where
the
claims
point
to
rather
than
define
the
invention.
and
that's
just
not
workable
today.
we'll
get
an
equivalents
claim
in
every
case.
and
so,
let's
make
an
exception
where
the
lawyer
couldn't
really
do
anything
about
it.
that's
called
unforeseeability.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
with
that
possible
exception,
which
they
maybe
should
have
mentioned
but
didn't,
it's
up
to
the
lawyer
and
it's
his
fault.
and
the
reason
is
if
he
didn't
do
it
properly,
we
punish
him
because
we
have
to
have
certainty
for
people
who
want
to
invent
other
things.
now,
that
i
take
it
is
the
heart
of
what's
being
said
on
the
other
side,
and
i'd
like
to
know
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
not
arguing
for
abolition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
arguing
for
hold
the
lawyer
to
a
very
tough
standard,
but
a
small
equitable
exception
in
the
instance
where
the
lawyer
really
couldn't
really
do
anything
about
it,
namely
where
it's
not
foreseeable
that
this
kind
of
really
copied
device
is
going
to
come
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
the
language
isn't...
you
know,
english
doesn't
work
perfectly,
the
english
language,
and
because
there
could
be
future
inventions
that
might
cause
that
to
be
unforeseeable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
because
they
have
ways
of
doing
it.
they
say
all
the
things
like,
or
they
say...
you
know,
i
can't
remember.
there's
a
special
technical
word
for
it
where
you...
you
try
to
do
it
in
terms
of
function.
there
are
ways
of
doing
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
briefs
are
filled...
you
know,
the
briefs
are
filled
with
them,
how...
how
easy
it
is.
the
other
side
says,
no,
no,
it's
very
easy,
and
your
side
says,
oh,
really?
it
isn't
so
easy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i'm
not
thinking...
i'm
not
thinking
that.
i'm
thinking
there's
a...
there
is
a
way
of
drafting
a
claim
where
you
put
in
the
claim...
you
don't
describe
the
thing
exactly.
you
describe
what
the
thing
does.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
i
was
going
to
buy
your
product
and
i
knew
what
the
german
patents
contained
and
you
were
trying
to
sell
it
to
me,
and
i
asked
you
this.
what
does
your
product
do
that
the
product
covered
by
the
german
patents
doesn't
do?
what
would
you
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly,
and...
and
therefore,
they
are
saying
that's
at
the
heart
of
this
thing.
the
sealing
rings
enabled
the...
enabled
you
to
use
a
larger
piston
because
it
could
come
closer
to
the
side
of
the
cylinder.
and
here
they've
copied...
they...
they...
so,
you
defined
it
this
way,
we
didn't
follow
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly,
but
the
heart
of
your
invention
was
a
way
of
wiping
the
inside
of
the
tube--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
i
understand
it,
so
that
the
piston
could
come
closer
to
the
inside
of
the
tube.
and
you
defined
that
by
using
two
rings.
and
they
say,
well,
that's
what
the
heart
of
the
invention
was,
these
two
rings,
and
we
didn't
use
two
rings.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
used
one
ring.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
you
say
it
performed
exactly
the
same.
they
say
it
didn't
quite
work
quite
as
well.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
this
is
the
heart
of
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
let
me
show
you
why.
because
the
federal
circuit
is
saying
inventors
generally
have
to
put
this
kind
of
an
issue
before
a
jury
or
a
judge
who
doesn't
understand
it
too
well.
and
that's
why
there's
a
lack
of
certainty
and
that's
why
we
have
to
have
the
rule
we
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
argument
you're
now
making
is
a
wonderful
argument
against
the
whole
doctrine
of
equivalents,
which
i
thought
we
had
rejected.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
may
well
be.
but...
but
if...
if
the
considerations
that
you're
raising
now
are
as
forceful
as
you
think
they
are,
we
should
simply
abolish
the
doctrine
of
equivalents.
that...
that
would
give
great
certainty
to
the
patent
law,
and
all
of
the...
all
of
the
things
that
you
assert
would
be
achieved.
the
patentee
is
on
notice
and
he
should
be
as
precise
as
possible,
blah,
blah,
blah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
explain
to
me
a
little
more
clearly
what...
what
you
assert
relates
to
patentability
means?
i
mean,
if...
if
you
narrow
the
phrase
to
mean
it...
it
relates
only
to
prior
art
or
to
any
impediment
to
getting
the
invention
accepted
as
novel
or
whatever,
i
understand
what
it
means.
but
if
it...
if
it
includes
any
change
that
is
made
in
order
to
get
the
examiner
to
accept
the
patent,
then
what
change
does
not
relate
to
patentability?
if...
if,
as
you
assert,
patent
attorneys
are
so
reluctant
to
make
any
changes,
what
change
would
not
relate
to
patentability?
the
only
reason
they're
doing
it
is
to
get
the
patent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
what
narrowing
changes
would
not
relate
to
patentability?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can't
imagine
any
because
why
would
you
do
it
unless--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--unless
to
get
the
examiner
to
accept...
to
accept
your
patent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
but
why...
why
talk
about
changes
that
relate
to
patentability?
why
not
just
say
all
narrowing
changes?
let's
make
it
clear
what
we're
talking
about.
you're
saying
all
narrowing
changes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
you
think
that
that's...
that's
what
we
meant
in...
in
warner-jenkinson
by...
by
changes
that
relate
to
patentability.
all
narrowing
changes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
be
a
very
strange
terminology
to
use
to
refer
to
all
narrowing
changes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
synonymous
with
patentability.
