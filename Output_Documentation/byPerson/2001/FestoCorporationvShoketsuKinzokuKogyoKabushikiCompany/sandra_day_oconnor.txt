mr.
bork,
both
the
solicitor
general
and
an
amicus,
the
ieee,
suggest
that
a...
a
different
flexible
bar
test
would
be
appropriate.
would
you
comment
on
those
two
proposals?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
you,
before
you
step
down,
whether
you
think
there's
a
relevant
difference
between
claim
elements
and
claim
limitations?

mr.
wallace,
the
government
is
proposing
a
change,
a
backing
off
from
what
the
cafc
did,
but
proposing
some
new
formulation
or
test.
how
does
the
test
you
propose
differ
from
that
proposed
by
the
institute
of
electrical
and
electronics
engineers
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they...
they
key
it
into
foreseeability
somehow.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
do
you
apparently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
isn't
that
enough?
why...
why
is
an
additional
rule
sought?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
the
sg's
test
apply
to
that,
do
you
think?
