justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
this
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
not
talking
about
the
trade
dress
claim.
it
was
the
patent
infringement
counterclaim
that
was
in
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
it
not
arise
out
of
the
same
transaction
and
occurrence
which
under
the
rules
is
interpreted
broadly?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
that
respondent
who
started
his
own
show
in
the...
in
the
cit...
when
the
defendant
in
that
case
turns
up
as
plaintiff
in
kansas
district
court...
was
it?
the...
the
district
court
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
i
just
wanted
to
know
where
the
forum
was.
the
forum
that
the
plaintiff
is
suing
in
is
in
the
tenth
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it's
in
kansas.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
suppose
the
plaintiff
in
the
suit
in
new
york
then
brings
that
same
claim
in
the
district
court
in
kansas
and
says,
court,
please
consolidate
these
two,
and
then
you
don't
have
a
counterclaim.
you
have
two
claims
consolidated
for
adjudication.
suppose
that
were
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then,
i
take
it,
the
judgment
is
rendered.
there's
a
patent
claim,
not
a
counterclaim,
but
a
claim,
and
then
the
jurisdiction
is
in
the
federal
circuit.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
you
a
question
that
puts
together
two
claims,
not
counterclaims,
two
claims.
the
district
court
has
made
the
judgment
that
these
arise
out
of
the
same
transaction
and
occurrence
and
therefore
consolidates
them
because
it
makes
sense
in
terms
of
judicial
economy.
okay.
they
are
processed
as
consolidated
cases.
there's
a
judgment.
where
does
the
appeal
go?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
they
are
tried
at
the
same
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they're
both
plaintiffs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting
in...
in
response
to
my
question
that
they
would...
these
two
cases
that
have
been
consolidated
would
then
be
split
apart
for
purposes
of
appeal
and
one
claim
would
go
to
a
regional
circuit
and
the
other
to
the
federal
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the...
in
the
context
where
there's
a
great
concern
about
federal-state
relations,
cases
lodged
in
the
state
court
being
lifted
out
of
that
state
court
and
put
into
a
federal
court,
this
context
is
totally
different.
it
is
an
entirely
federal
context,
and
it's
a
question
of
which
appellate
forum
it
goes
to.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
just
say
that
what
arising
under
means
in
the
original
jurisdiction
context
it
necessarily
means
when
we're
talking
about
an
exclusive
appellate
forum
for
a
case
that's
colored
federal
totally.
there's
no
state
element
in
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
christianson
was
the
first
time
the
court
encountered
this
issue,
and
christianson
affirmed
the
federal
circuit.
the
federal
circuit
said,
we
don't
have
the
appellate
authority
in
this
case.
a
couple
of
years
later,
the
federal
circuit
looked
at
the
issue
again
in
aerojet
and
it
wrote
an
opinion
saying
these
are
different.
in
one
case
we
were
dealing
with
a
defense,
an
issue,
a
question,
and
in
another
case,
we've
got
a
claim.
and
for
purposes
of
which
court
of
appeals
it
goes
to,
maybe
the
court
is...
in
aerojet
is
saying
we
have
to
qualify
christianson's
reasoning
if
not...
not
its
result.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
talking
about
federal
law
interpreted
differently
by
different
circuits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
like
am
i
going
to
choose
the
law
of
france
or
the
law
of
oklahoma
versus
the
law
of
new
york.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
little
odd,
don't
you
think?
we
are
talking
about
one
law,
a
federal
law.
it
is
not
quite
the
same
as
talking
about
the
law
of
california,
the
law
of
nevada.
and
wasn't
one
of
the
purposes
of
having
the
federal
circuit
so
that
you
would
reduce
the
number
of
disparities
in...
in
federal
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you...
you
don't
mean
that
the
federal
circuit
has
asserted
that
where
you
have
a
state
claim,
that
it's
going
to
apply
federal
law
to
that
state
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you
are
saying
that
the
federal
circuit
said
we
have
the
right
not
only
to
determine
what
is
an
answer
to
a
federal
issue,
but
we
have
a
right
to
tell
iowa
what
the
law
of
the
state
of
iowa
is?
that
would
be
astonishing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on...
on
one
point
that
you
made
about
the
federal
circuit
saying,
well,
if
it's
a
federal
question,
what
is
the
federal
law?
we
decide
that
as
our
sister
circuits
do.
it's
just
asserting
that
it's
a
court
of
equal
dignity,
that
it's
not
under
the
enthrall
of
the
tenth
circuit
or
any
other
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is...
what
is...
taking
a
case,
mr.
dabney...
and
this
has
come
up
i
think
again
and
again...
where
you
have
a
counterclaim
that
would
qualify
for
federal
jurisdiction
whether
under
1331,
1338,
whatever,
that
for
whatever
reason,
the
main
claim
drops
out,
maybe
because
it
failed...
fails
to
state
a
claim.
the
counterclaim,
whether
it's
an
antitrust
claim,
patent
claim,
copyright
claim,
stays
in
federal
court
and
it's
not
supplemental
to
anything.
it
has
its
own
jurisdictional
base.
it's
a
federal
claim.
and
if
it
weren't
a
federal
claim,
it
couldn't
stay
there
because
it
would
have
nothing
to
pend
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
not
many,
many
cases
in
the
district
court,
blessed
by
the
courts
of
appeals,
where
exactly
what
i've
described
happens?
the
main
claim
drops
for
whatever
reason.
there's
a
counterclaim
that
would
qualify
independently
for
federal
jurisdiction.
the
court
will
adjudicate
that.
but
if
it
has
a
counterclaim
that
would
not
independently
qualify,
it
is
not
likely
to
hang
onto
that
case.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because...
because
the
only
federal
peg
is
gone.
and
pendent
jurisdiction
is
exercised
when
there's
a
tail
that's
attached
to
a
dog,
but
when
the
dog
is
gone,
the
tail
doesn't
stay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
i
asked
you
is
you
said
that
what
had
been
going
on
for
years
before
there
was
1367
codified,
all
of
a
sudden
that
independent
federal
claim,
be
it
an
antitrust
claim,
a
patent
claim,
suddenly
becomes
shrunken
to
a
supplemental
jurisdiction
rather
than
having
its
own
jurisdictional
peg.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
about
a
defendant
who
would
just
love
to
have...
not
particularly
litigious,
has
a
claim,
a
good
claim,
asserts
it
as
a
counterclaim,
goes
into
the
district
court
because
that's
where
it
belongs?
i
just
don't
understand
why
the
rule
that
would
apply
to
the
district
court
carries
over
to
the
specialized
court
of
appeals
if
you
are,
in
fact,
dealing
with
a
patent
claim
that's
been
adjudicated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
defendant
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't...
this
defendant
did.
he
started
in
the...
in
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gowdey,
may
i
suggest
that
you
raise
that
a
little
higher?
the
podium.
i'm
having
some
trouble
hearing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
congress
didn't
use
it...
congress
didn't
say
well-pleaded
complaint.
it
said...
it
said
arising
under.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
giving
arising
under
a
different
meaning
for
appellate
purposes.
you
are
including
the
counterclaim,
a
different
meaning
from
original
jurisdiction
where,
as
justice
breyer
read,
everybody
agrees
that
for
original
jurisdiction
purposes,
counterclaims
don't
count.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
suggesting
they
do
count
for
appellate
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
patents
issue
adjudicated
at
all
here?
and
there
was
not
a
judgment.
the
judgment,
the
54(b)
judgment,
was
on
trade
dress
alone?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
there's
not
only
the
no
judgment,
but
no
adjudication?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it
would
be
consistent
with
justice
stevens'
opinion
to
say
you
look
to
see
what
was
adjudicated.
his
concurring
opinion
suggests
that.
and
if
what
was
adjudicated
was
the
patent
claim,
whether
it
were
a
claim
or
a
counterclaim,
then
that's
what
should
count.
if
what
were
adjudicated
were
a
trade
dress
claim,
then
that's
what
should
count.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're...
you're
telling
us
that
this
is
unqualified.
i
think
mr.
gowdey
said
that
the
relationship
language
is...
that
it's...
it's
only
in
the
intersection
of
patent
law,
not
just
any...
any
question
that
comes
along.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
don't
see
what
the
federal
circuit
meant
when
it
said
the
relationship
between
patent
law
and
other
federal
rights.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
questions
involving
the
relationship
between
those
two.
the
federal
circuit
has
interpreted
that
to
be
unlimited?
