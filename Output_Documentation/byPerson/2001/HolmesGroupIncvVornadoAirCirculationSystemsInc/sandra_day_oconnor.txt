well,
congress
did
want
patent
law
to
be
uniform,
didn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that's
why
it
placed
the
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
to
the
extent
that
you
then
allow
the
other
courts
of
appeals
to
deal
with
patent
claims,
you're
defeating
that
uniformity
goal.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
may
i
ask
a
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not...
not
your
case
certainly,
but
we
had
a
case
called
cardinal
chemical
company
v.
morton
international
in
1993,
which
seemed
to
say
that
a
patent
law
counterclaim
could
serve
as
an
independent
basis
for
a
district
court's
original
jurisdiction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
1338?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
had
the
opposite
problem.
the
first
counsel
had
a
very
loud
voice
and
yours
is
very
soft.
so--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
that's...
that's
this
cafc's
ruling
on
its
own
jurisdiction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
aerojet
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
in
effect,
we're
trying
to
decide
whether
that's
right
in
this
circumstance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
does
seem
to
be
unlikely,
does
it
not,
that
where
the
counterclaim
raising
the
patent
issue
hasn't
been
dealt
with
and
what
we're
dealing
with
is
an
appeal
from
this
injunction
which
was
rendered
in
the
plaintiff's
suit
below...
why
should
the
cafc
get
into
it
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
think
it
would
have
to
be
considered
also
in
light
of
what's
happened
in
this
case.
i
don't
see
why
you
would
be
so
limited
necessarily.
it
seems
so
odd
that
this
appeal
would
go
to
the
federal
circuit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
case
of
ours
do
you
think
most
strongly
supports
your
view
of
this
jurisdictional
question?
