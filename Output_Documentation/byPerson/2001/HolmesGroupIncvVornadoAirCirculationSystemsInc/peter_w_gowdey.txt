mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
light
of
the
colloquy
that
we've
had,
i
want
to
make
a
preliminary
point
and
then
a
couple
other
starting
points.
the
first
is
that
there's
absolutely
no
issue
that
the
federal
circuit
has
failed
to
follow
this
court's
precedents
and,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out
previously,
correctly
anticipated
this
court's
holding
in
christianson.
and
to
respond
to
a
question
that
justice
o'connor
raised,
in
the
cardinal
case,
this
court
did
say,
in
this
case
cardinal
properly
invoked
the
original
jurisdiction
of
a
district
court
by
way
of
its
patent
counterclaim.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
in
the
which
opinion,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
i
think...
i
think
that
the
position
that
the
federal
circuit
has
taken
this
court
is
completely
consistent
with
christian
v.
colt.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
yes.
and...
and
i
say
that
because
of
the
reasoning
and
the
procedures
and
the...
and
the
considered
exhaustive
review
that
the
federal
circuit
made
in
aerojet
or
the
christian
v.
colt
case.
they
started
their
aerojet
decision
saying
that
the
question
was
of
exceptional
importance
and,
because
of
that,
sat
on
their
choice
en
banc.
they
exactly
framed
the
question
in
that
case,
which
was
whether--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--i...
i
do
have
a
soft
voice
and
i
apologize.
they
framed
the
question
in
christian
v.
colt...
in...
in
aerojet
as
being
one
where
you
do
not
have
a
patent
issue
as
the
complaint,
but
you
have
a
patent
counterclaim
coming
in.
and
in
that
case,
it
was
a
compulsory
patent
counterclaim.
should
that
be
a
sufficient
basis
for
giving
exclusive
appellate
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
circuit?
they
answered
that
it
was.
the
aerojet
opinion
is...
is
well-crafted.
it's
a
thoughtful
opinion.
it
goes
through
analysis--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--that's
correct.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
they...
they
looked--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--because
we
should
look
at
jurisdiction
for
an
appellate
court
at
the
time
of
the
pleading
stage
of
the
case,
your
honor.
and
at
the
pleading
stage,
you
have
the
complaint
and
you
have
the
answer
and
counterclaims--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--i...
i
don't
think
it's
odd,
your
honor.
i
think
that
you
have
to
establish
appellate
jurisdiction
at
the
beginning
of
a
case
so
that
as
a
case
proceeds,
if
there
are
interlocutory
appeals
that...
that
are
going
to
happen,
where
is
it
that
they
should
be
properly
directed?
and
there
should
not
be
a
conundrum
as...
as
to
that.
and
if
you
look
at
the
claims
in
the
case,
if
you
look
under
1338
and
1295,
talking
about
civil
actions
and
claims,
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
circuit
should...
should
be
decided
by
what
claims
are
pled.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
i...
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
christian
v.
colt
and
the
fact
that
in
that
case,
the
decision
said
it
should
be
adapted
to
1338.
i
think
the
aerojet
decision
that
comes
along
after
that
and
its
exhaustive
review
of
christianson
makes
clear
that...
that
you
should
look
at
claims.
and
as
you're
adapting
1338
to
the
patent
situation--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--well--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--well,
in
christian
v....
in
christianson,
however,
there
was
no
counterclaim.
that...
that
issue
was
not
before
the
court.
that
issue
has
not
yet
been
addressed
by
this...
by
this
court,
which
is
why
i
think
looking
at
the
aerojet
decision
and
looking
at
the
review
that
it
made
of
christianson
is
important
for
this
court
to...
to
undertake
and
to
look
at.
there
were--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--yes--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--well,
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
aerojet.
first,
had
the--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--and...
and
i
think
most
of
the
cases
that
i'm
aware
of
that
talk
about
counterclaims
are
removal
cases.
that's
where
you
have
a...
a
state/federal
issue.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
removal
cases,
your
honor,
where...
where
you...
and
there
is
no
issue
of
federalism
here.
the...
the
petitioner
properly
brought
a
case
in...
in
the
federal
district
court
in
kansas.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
well--
[laughter]
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
then...
then
i
must
retract
it.
it
does
not...
it
does
not
involve
all
cases
of
removal.
this
is
a
patent
case,
and...
and
i
think
we're
talking
about
patent
issues
and
whether
the
federal
circuit
has
proper
jurisdiction
of
claims
in
a
case
involving
patent
issues.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
i...
i
think
that
arising
under
is
not
to
be
interpreted
in
a
different
way,
but
i
think
as
this
court
said
in
christianson,
that
it
should
be
adapted
to
1338.
it
should
be
adapted
to
1338
because,
under
1295,
congress
was
interested
in
getting
as
many
patent
claims
to
the
federal
circuit
as
it
could.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
i...
i
think
it's
a
question
of...
of
looking
at
claims
that
are
pled
in
a
case.
if...
if
you
look
at
the
second
point
of
chief...
chief
judge
markey
in
aerojet,
he
was...
he
was
taking
a...
a
look
at
claims.
and
a
patent
claim,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
earlier,
has
its
own
separate,
independent
jurisdictional
base
under
1338.
once
you
find
that
a
patent
claim
comes
in
under
1338
with
its
own
jurisdictional
basis,
under
1295
that
is
an
appeal-directing
mechanism
that
congress
put
into
place.
and...
and
i
think
that
if
you
go
again
to
aerojet,
as
chief
judge
markey
pointed
out
in
his
first
reason
for
why
the
patent
counterclaim
should
be
considered
arising
under
and
give
appellate
jurisdiction,
had
that
counterclaim
been
filed
as
a
complaint,
there's
no
question
that...
that
federal
circuit
jurisdiction
would
have
been
invoked.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
it
does
not
change
the
rule.
i
believe,
your
honor,
you're
talking
about
removal
cases.
and
certainly
if...
if
you
have--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--because
i
think
in
a
federal/federal
situation
where
there
is
no
federalism,
there
is
no
issue
with
respect
to
states'
rights
and
states'
claims.
and...
and
we're
not
talking
about
a...
a
reading
of
1338
or
1295
where
you...
where
we're
concerned
about
somehow
taking
away
the
essence
of...
of
a
state
court
to
deal
with
state
court
actions.
and...
and
we're
not
talking
about
that.
this
court
does
not
need
to,
i
think,
even
go
there.
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
you
have
a
federal
question
that
has
been
properly
presented
in
a
federal
court.
original
jurisdiction
has
been
applied.
a...
a
patent
counterclaim
comes
in
that
has
its
own
separate
jurisdictional
base
under
1338.
the
question
then
is,
from
an
appellate
standpoint,
has
congress
set
up
and
dictated
an
appellate-directing
mechanism
with
1295?
and
i
think
they
have.
and
they
recognized
when
they
said,
as
long
as
jurisdiction
was
based
in
whole
or
in
part
under
1338,
that
not
all
of
the
case
would
have
to
be
patent
cases.
it
could
be
part
of
it.
and
once
you
have
the
nexus
between
a
district
court
having
original
jurisdiction
under
1338,
1295
directs
that
that
appeal...
for
the
patent
cases,
1295
directs
that
appeal
should
go
to
the
federal
circuit.
i...
i
think
the
basic
purpose
of...
of
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
was...
was
to
avoid
the...
the
sort
of
state/federal
conflicts.
since
that's
not
here,
then
there
is...
is
no
reason
to
say
that
there
should
be
a
compelled
disregard
of...
of
counterclaims.
and
where
congress'
intent
was
to
get
as
many
patent
claims
as
possible
to
the
federal
circuit,
again--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--i...
i
think
the
language
is
the
same.
but
again,
going
back
to
what
this
court--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think,
as
this
court
said
in
christianson,
by
adapting
that
under
1338,
there
are...
there
is
a
way
to
accomplish
both
the
jurisdictional
goals
and
the
intent
of
congress
of
getting
patent
claims--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--i...
i
think--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--i'm
suggesting
that
they
do,
and
i'm
suggesting
that
congress
recognized
that
in
1295
where...
where,
unlike
petitioner,
i...
i
think
when...
when
a
plaintiff
comes
into
court,
clearly
he
has
his
choice
of...
of
what
federal
court
to
go
to,
what
state,
and
so
on.
under
1295,
once
you
have
patent
claims
in
a
case,
i
think
congress
set
up
an
appellate-directing
mechanism
that...
that
does
not
make
it
a
litigant's
choice.
it
defines
where
it
goes.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
well,
i
think
justice
stevens
actually
goes
farther
than
we
need
to
go
because--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--well--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--well,
i'm
saying
he...
he
went
further.
he...
he's
saying,
i
believe,
that
you
could
even
look
at...
at
federal
circuit
jurisdiction
being...
being
shown
where
you
have
amended
a
complaint
later
on,
that
you
could
get
a
patent
issue
under
that...
in
at
that
point.
in...
in
this
case
here,
there
was
a
patent
issue
that
came
in
at
the
pleading
stage.
and
so
that...
that's
the
distinction
that
i...
that
i
would
see.
that's
why
i'm
saying
you
don't
have
to
go
so
far
as...
as
to
say
you
look
at
the
well-tried
case.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
there
has
not
been
a
patent
ruling
yet,
your
honor.
we
didn't
get
that
far.
we
haven't--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--no
adjudication,
not
even
any
discovery,
your
honor.
so...
so,
we
have
a
patent...
a
patent
case
that
has,
in
essence,
a...
a
very
young
one,
that
has
not
gotten
very
far
except
for
the
fact
that
we
have
this
preliminary
injunction
from
judge
brown
in
kansas.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
1338,
however,
talks
about
civil
actions,
and
civil
actions
goes...
goes
back
to
a
description
of
being
all
claims
for
relief.
we
would
say
that
you
should
look
for
the
claims
that
are
made
for
relief
at
the
time
the
case
is...
is
being
pled.
that
is
the
point
at
which
i
think
you
should
have
appellate
jurisdiction
being
decided
so
that
as
interim
or
interlocutory
appeals
happens,
you
know
appellate
court
it
goes
to.
if
you
waited
until
you...
you
saw
what
was
actually
tried
in
a
case
and,
as
justice
stevens
suggested,
you
waited
even
to
see
if
the...
if
a
complaint
would
be
amended
subsequently
after
the
pleading
stage,
earlier...
earlier
disposition
of
interlocutory
orders
might
go
somewhere
else,
and
appropriately
so.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
well,
but
if...
your
honor,
if...
if--
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
--if...
if
you're
looking
at
the
claims
that
are
pled
at
the
pleading
stage,
the
district
court
judge
will
know
what
appellate
court
will...
will
apply
certainly
under
the
aerojet
rule,
which...
which
again
would...
would
place
appellate
jurisdiction
at
the
federal
circuit
if
you
have
a
well-pled
patent
counterclaim
coming
in
at
the
pleading
stage
as
part
of
the
defendant's
answer.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
perhaps
that's
a
more
difficult
question.
i
think
the
federal
circuit,
being
a
sister...
sister
circuit
to
the
rest
of
the
regional
circuit
courts
of
appeal,
certainly
would
make
an
effort
to
apply
the
appropriate
regional
circuit
law
to
non-patent
issues.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
well,
i
think
the
federal
circuit
is
making
an
attempt
to
look
at
its...
its
historical
base
for
decisions
with
respect
to
those
issues
that
relate
to,
in
effect,
patent
law
issues.
now,
the
way
i
read
cases
coming
from
the
federal
circuit,
they're
making
an
attempt
to
apply
law
of
their
own
where
they
find
either
there...
there
is
conflict
or
where
there
has
not
been
a
well-grounded
set
of
policies
or
law
to
decide
an
issue.
where
the
regional
circuit
has
laws
that
are
not
affecting
patents,
my
reading
is
the
federal
circuit
is
applying
regional
circuit
law
in
an
appropriate
way
as
they
see
fit
from
panel
to
panel.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
i
think
they
are,
and
i
think
as
the...
the
court
was
started
in
1982,
and
by...
by
that
measure,
it's
a
relatively
young
court.
aerojet
has
been
around
half
of
its
lifetime
since
1990.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
certainly
in
midwest,
they...
they
were...
they
were
taking
a
look
at
trade
dress
law
because
of
the
interrelationship
trade
dress
has
on
the
lanham
act
with
patent
issues.
to
that
extent,
they
certainly
were
looking
at
new
law
and
saying
where
there
is
an
interaction
of
laws
and
holdings
with
respect
to
patent
issues,
that
that
is
an
area
that
they...
they
can
and
perhaps
should
get
into.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
are
you
talking
about
the
exception
of
1295,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
certainly
that's
a
two-part
exception,
and
where
you
have
other
claims
pending,
you
can
still
have
jurisdiction
under
1338.
mr.
peter
w.
gowdey
it
keeps
all
well
employed,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
that
where...
where
there
are
issues
that
relate
to
patent
law,
certainly
they...
they
will
be
looking
to
federal
circuit
precedent
to
help
them.
where
there
are
non-patent
law
issues,
it's
the
regional
circuit
law
that
can
and
should
control.
and...
and
i
think
that
as
the
court
develops
in
time,
there
will
be...
there
will
be
a
larger
body
of
law
that...
that
will
help
district
circuit
judges
in
that
regard.
as
respects
this
case,
however,
where...
where
we
have
a
patent
counterclaim,
i
think
the
aerojet
decision
and
looking
at
what
went
on
before
christian...
christianson,
looking
at...
at
the
christianson
decision
itself
and
the
analysis
that
that
court
did
with
chief
judge
markey
speaking
for
the
whole
court
en
banc,
very
carefully
and
thoughtfully
gives
a
legitimate
basis
for
why
a
federal
circuit
should
have
jurisdiction
over
cases
where
there
is
a
well-pleaded
compulsory
counterclaim
at
the
district
court
level.
chief
judge
markey
also
noted
at
895
f.
2d
at
742,
in
all
events,
the
supreme
court
did
hold
in
christianson
or
in
any
other
case
that
for
all
cases
and
circumstances
only
the
complaint
and
never
a
counterclaim
can
serve
as
the
basis
of
district
court
jurisdiction.
and
under
section
1295,
the
basis
of
district
court
jurisdiction
is
for
this
court
an
appeal-directing
mechanism.
and
i
think
that's
where
1295
really
is...
is
important
and
the
interconnection
with...
with
1338.
if
there
are
no
other...
no
other
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
