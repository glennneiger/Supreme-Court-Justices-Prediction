justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
just
aerojet,
but
i
would
like
you
to
pursue
that
because
my
understanding
is
the
same
as
justice
scalia's.
you
started
out
by
saying,
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
that
footnote
2
applies.
i
take
it
that
means
we
now
have
an
issue
that
does
not
just
concern
patent
law.
it
concerns
all
of
federal
jurisdiction.
you
then
said
we
look
to
what
is
filed
in
the
district
court
at
the
complaint
stage.
again,
all
of
federal
jurisdiction.
you
then
say
that
all
these
other
cases
involved
a
well-pleaded
complaint
and
an
answer.
this
one,
though,
involves
a
well-pleaded
complaint
and
a
compulsory
counterclaim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree.
so,
i
look
up
wright
and
miller,
and
wright
and
miller
says
it
is
not
sufficient
for
the
federal
question
to
enter
the
case
as
a
counterclaim
asserted
by
the
defendant.
now,
he
didn't
just
make
that
up.
he
has
dozens
of
citations.
so,
at
that
point
i
think
qed.
you
lose.
now,
why
don't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
aerojet,
to
my
way
of
thinking,
just
said
it's
a
counterclaim.
it's
not
a
defense.
okay,
i
accept
that.
but
i
still
have
wright
and
miller
and
all
the
cases
they
cite.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you're...
you're
now
defeating
your
first
concession
which
was
with
footnote
2
in
aerojet,
that
we
are
to
deal
with
this
case
exactly
as
if
it
were
a
removal
case
because
it's
a
question
of
all
federal
jurisdiction,
not
just
patent.
the
word
is
arising
under.
that's
in
fact...
i
flag
it
because
that's
what
frightens
me.
i
thought
that
if
all
that
were
at
issue
here
were
patent
cases,
we
weren't
going
to
make
a
big
mistake
either
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
once
you
tell
me
that
this
involves
all
cases
of
removal,
i
suddenly
get
quite
nervous
about
departing
from
well-settled
law.
