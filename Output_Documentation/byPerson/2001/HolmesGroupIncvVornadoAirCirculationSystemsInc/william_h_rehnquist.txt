no.
01-408,
the
holmes
group
v.
vornado
air
circulation
systems,
inc.--
mr.
dabney.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
this
case,
it
was
compulsory.
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
did...
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
in
this
case
that
the...
the
counterclaim
was
compulsory?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
choice
of
law,
you're
not
talking
strictly
about
patent
law,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dabney,
we're
all
quite
close
to
you.
i
think
perhaps
we
can
hear
you
even
if
you
don't
speak
so
quite
so
loudly.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dabney,
would
you
heed
my
admonition?
please
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
dabney.
mr.
gowdey,
we'll
hear...
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gowdey,
do
you
think
the
court
of...
the
federal
circuit's
opinion
here
is
entirely
consistent
with
footnote
2
in
our
colt
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in...
in
our
christianson
v.
colt
industries?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and...
and
with
footnote
2
therein?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
what...
what
kind
of
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainly
christianson
gave
no
intimation
that
the
phrase,
arising
under,
should
be
interpreted
differently
in
the
statute
conferring
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
circuit
as
it
has
traditionally
been
in
1331.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's...
you
can
say
that
by
analogy
to
1331
too,
that
although
you
can
have
a...
a
compulsory
counterclaim
will
not
change
the
result
there.
it
still
goes
to
federal
court
if...
if
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine
is
applied.
you
could
say,
well,
the
compulsory
counterclaim
could
have
been
in
its
own
right
a
case
of
federal
question,
but
that
doesn't
change
the
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
does
it
make
a
difference
if
we're
talking
about
removal
cases?
because
the
language
is
exactly
the
same.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you...
you
can
say,
i
think,
that
when
congress
used
the
term,
well-pleaded
complaint,
its
intent
was
to
have
the
same
sort
of
analysis
as
there
is
in
1331.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gowdey.
mr.
dabney,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
briefly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dabney.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-408
holmes
group,
inc.
versus
vornado
air
circulation
systems
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
