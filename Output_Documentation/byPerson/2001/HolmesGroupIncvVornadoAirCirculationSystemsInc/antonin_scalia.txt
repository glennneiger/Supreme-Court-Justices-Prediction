justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dabney,
has
the
federal
circuit
held
that
whenever
there's
a
patent
claim
in
a...
in
a...
a
patent
issue
in
a
counterclaim,
it
has
jurisdiction?
or
must
it
be
a
compulsory
counterclaim?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
come
on.
give
us
a
little
bit.
surely,
surely
in
that
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gowdey,
i...
i
think
aerojet
makes
a
whole
lot
of
sense
if...
if
the
issue
before
the...
the
court
there
and
the
issue
before
us
here
were
what
makes
sense.
then...
then
aerojet
may...
may
well
be
right.
but...
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
really
before
us
is
what
does
section
1295
mean.
what
was
it
understood
to
mean
when
it
spoke
of
a
claim
arising
under
any
act
of
congress
relating
to
copyrights
and
trademarks?
and
that's
a
different
question.
and
when
you
have
a
long
history
known
to
every
first-year
law
student
that
a
case
arises
under
a
certain
law,
if
the
well-pleaded
complaint
invokes
that
law
and
does
not
arise
under
that
law
if...
if
a
counterclaim
invokes
it,
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
anyone
would
interpret
the
statute,
written
with
that
magic
language,
in
any
other
way.
now,
it...
it
might
well
be
the
case,
as
you
argue,
that
another
disposition
is
more
sensible
for
the
federal
circuit.
but
we
have
to
deal
here
with
what
congress
said,
and
the...
and
the
whole
issue
is
whether
a
claim
arising
under
an
act
of
congress
isn't
magic
language
that...
that
the
whole
legal
community
has
known
for
many
years,
which
means
you
have
to
have
a
well-pleaded
complaint
invoking
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
i
think
we
said
in
christianson.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
it
involves
a
rather
technical
question
concerning
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court.
petitioner
filed
a
federal
court
action
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
its
products
did
not
infringe
respondent’s
trade
dress
and
in
an
injunction
restraining
respondent
from
accusing
it
of
such
infringement.
respondent’s
answer
asserted
a
compulsory
patent
infringement
counterclaim.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
respondent
then
appealed
to
the
federal
circuit
instead
of
the
regional
court
of
appeals,
which
in
this
case
would
have
been
the
tenth
circuit.
the
federal
circuit,
notwithstanding
the
petitioner’s
challenge
to
its
jurisdiction,
vacated
the
district
court’s
judgment
and
remanded
the
case.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
vacate
and
remand
with
instructions
to
transfer
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
tenth
circuit.
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
section
1295(a)(1),
the
federal
circuit
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
“an
appeal
from
a
final
decision
of
a
district
court
of
the
united
states
if
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
was
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
28
u.s.c.
section
1338.
28
u.s.c.
section
1338(a)
gives
district
courts
jurisdiction
over
civil
actions
“arising
under",
magic
words
to
lawyers,
"arising
under
federal
patent
law.”
because
1338(a)
uses
the
same
operative
language,
arising
under,
as
28
u.s.c.
section
1331
which
confers
general
federal
question
jurisdiction
on
the
district
courts.
we
held
in
a
case
called
christianson
versus
colt
industries
operating
corporation
that
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
governing
whether
a
case
arises
under
1331
also
governs
whether
a
case
arises
under
section
1338(a).
as
adapted
to
section
1338(a),
that
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
provides
that
whether
a
case
arises
under
patent
law
is
determined
by
what
appears
in
the
plaintiff’s
well-pleaded
complaint.
that
is
a
complaint
that
does
not
have
surplus
agenda.
because
petitioner’s
well-pleaded
complaint
asserted
no
claim
arising
under
federal
patent
law
but
just
the
trade
dress
claim,
the
federal
circuit
erred
in
asserting
jurisdiction
over
this
appeal.
we
are
not
persuaded
by
respondent’s
argument
that
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
allows
a
counterclaim
to
serve
as
the
basis
for
a
district
courts
arising
under
jurisdiction.
to
accept
this
argument
would
contravene
the
face
of
the
complaint
principle
set
forth
in
our
prior
cases
and
the
long
standing
policies
furthered
by
that
principle.
it
would
leave
acceptance
or
rejection
of
a
state
forum
to
the
master
of
the
counterclaim
rather
than
to
the
plaintiff.
it
would
radically
expand
the
class
of
removable
cases,
and
it
would
undermine
the
clarity
and
ease
of
administration
of
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine.
we
are
also
not
persuaded
by
respondent’s
alternative
argument
that
reading
section
1295(a)(1)
and
section
1338(a)
to
confer
appellate
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
circuit
whenever
a
patent
law
counterclaim
is
raised
is
necessary
to
effect
congress’
goal
of
promoting
patent
law
uniformity.
this
court’s
task
is
not
to
determine
what
would
further
congress’
goal
but
to
determine
what
the
statute’s
words
must
fairly
be
understood
to
mean.
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
that
section
1338(a)’s
arising
under
language
means
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
when
read
on
its
own,
but
means
respondent’s
complaint
or
counterclaim
rule
when
it
is
referred
to
by
section
1295(a)(1).
