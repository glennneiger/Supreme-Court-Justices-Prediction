mr.
james
w.
dabney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
how
far
the
federal
circuit
can
properly
go
in
taking
jurisdiction
to
the
exclusion
of
the
regional
circuits.
in
its
recent
construction
of
its
appellate
jurisdiction,
the
federal
circuit
has
effectively
taken
the
position
that
the
defendant's
answer
containing
a
patent
counterclaim
acts
like
a
super
removal
petition.
the
federal
circuit
says
that
if
the
defendant
in
a
non-patent
suit
files
an
answer
that
includes
a
patent
counterclaim,
that
pleading
automatically
removes
the
plaintiff's
non-patent
suits
from
regional
circuit
jurisdiction
and
transfers
it
to
federal
circuit
jurisdiction.
according
to
the
respondent,
that
same
pleading
automatically
has
the
effect
of
changing
the
substantive
law
governing
non-patent
claims
in
the
plaintiff's
non-patent
suit
from
regional
circuit
to
federal
circuit
law,
and
the
decision
below
demonstrates
that
these
principles
apply
even
when
a
judgment
is
entered
which
doesn't
address
patent
law
at
all.
the
petitioner
respectfully
submits
that
the
decision
below
is
antithetical
to
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
established
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
congress--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--one...
mr....
your
honor,
one
of
the
congress'
objectives
in
establishing
the
federal
circuit
certainly
was--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--your
honor,
the
congress
in
enacting
1295,
according
to
this
court
in
christianson,
establishes
not
that
every
case
in
which
a
federal
patent
claim
is
raised
automatically
goes
to
the
federal
circuit.
this
court
in
christianson
held...
this
court
in
christianson
addressed
the
question,
how
do
we
know
if
a
case
belongs
in
the
federal
circuit?
that
was
the
specific
question
raised
in
christianson.
citing
the
legislative
history
of
1295,
this
court
answered
that
question.
cases
fall
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
circuit,
this
court
held,
in
the
same
sense
that
cases
are
said
to
arise
under
federal...
under
federal
law
for
purposes
of
federal
question
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
the
federal
circuit
has
held
in
the
dsc
communications
case
that
permissive
or
compulsory,
it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
your
honor,
it
is
far
from
clear
that
the
counterclaim
in
this
case
was
in
fact
compulsory.
the...
and
the...
and
the
court
can
see
that
most
clearly
by
looking
at
the
answer
that
was
actually
filed
in
this
case,
which
appears
on
pages
94
to
98
of
the
lodging.
the
one
thing
that's
conspicuously
absent
from
the
answer
filed
in
this
case
was
any
counterclaim
for
trade
dress
infringement.
well,
if
this
was--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
that.
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
decision--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--the
respondent
has
taken
the
position
that
the
patent
counterclaim
that
it
filed
in
this
particular
case
was
compulsory
within
the
meaning
of
rule
13.
no
court
has
passed
on
that
question
that--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--the
subject
matter
of
that
counterclaim
was,
at
the
time
it
was
filed,
the
subject
of
another
pending
proceeding.
and
it
is
far
from
clear
that
this
respondent
was
under
any
legal
duty
whatsoever
to
assert
that
patent
counterclaim
at
any
believable
risk
to
itself.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
at
the
time
that
the
present
action
was
commenced,
the
plaintiff
in
this
action
was
one
of
three
named
people
whom
the
respondent
was
trying
to
get
an
investigation
started
against.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
correct.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
yes.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
that
is
a
hypothetical
situation,
different
from
this
case.
i
would
suggest
that
the
district
court
has
an
arsenal
of
remedies
to
decide
whether
that
should
or
should
not
be
the
outcome
in
that
case.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
i...
i
would
say
in
practice
that
would
depend
in
large
measure
on
the
sequence
in
which
the
matters
are
tried,
whether
they
are
tried
at
the
same
time,
whether
they
are
tried
separately.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
tried
at
the
same
time?
i
believe
that
under
the
question
that
this
court
has
not
accepted
expressly
under
question
2,
it
would
be
open
to
both
sides
in
that
situation
to
request
that
the
district
court
enter
judgments
which
would
preserve
regional
circuit
jurisdiction
over
the
plaintiff's
non-patent
suit
in
the
first
case.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
i
understand.
and
no
one
in
this
case...
there's
no
question
in
this
case
as
to
what
the
appropriate
disposition
would
be
of
any
claim
for
patent
infringement
or
any
judgment
adjudicating
any
such
claim.
if
the
question
had
come
up--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--it
would
be
open
to
the
parties
to
that
litigation
in...
where
they're
both
plaintiffs
and
they
both
have
filed
claims,
to
request
the
entry
of
judgments
if
they
felt
it
was
in
their
interest
to
do
so,
based
on
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
not...
not
necessarily.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
when
a...
when
a
person
comes
to
court
and
asked
for
a
court
to
vary
the
rights
and
obligations
of
parties,
seeks
judicial
relief,
what
that
person
comes
to
court
with
is
a
bundle
of
rights.
that's
his
suit.
that
is
what
he's
asking
the
court
to
vindicate.
this
court
has
never
said
that
that
bundle
of
rights,
the
plaintiff's
right
to
choose
who's
going
to
decide
that
claim,
and
what
law
is
going
to
govern
that
claim,
can
be
changed
at
all
automatically
by
something
the
defendant
pleads
or
by
how
the--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--certainly.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
that
would
provide
a
narrower
basis
for
reversal.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
well,
we
did
in
the
petition,
but
the
court
declined
to
accept
question
2
in
the
petition.
what
your
honor
asked
me
was
specifically
question
2
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
and
the
court
did
not
accept
that
question
before
the
court.
hence,
we're
up
on
the
broader
question
of
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff's
well-pleaded
complaint
continues
to
govern
the
basis
of
arising
under
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
in
christianson,
to
decide
this
case,
the
court
need
look
hardly
beyond
486
u.s.,
page
814.
right
then
and
there
the
court
was
faced
with
the
question,
how
do
we
know
if
a
case
properly
belongs
in
the
federal
circuit?
and
the
court
held,
we
know
that
because
congress
has
told
us
the
answer.
what
congress
said
is,
cases
fall
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
circuit
in
the
same
way
that
they
are
said
to
arise
under
federal
law
for
purposes
of
general
federal
question
jurisdiction
under
1331.
the
cases
are
legion
which
say
that
what
a
defendant
pleads
in
its
answer,
whether
it's
an
affirmative
defense
or
a
counterclaim,
is
irrelevant
to
whether
a
case
falls
within
the
original
arising
under
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
your
honor,
i
would
say
two
things
in
response
to
that.
in
the
first
place,
that
was
exactly
the
argument
which
the
respondent
in
christianson
made.
in
footnote
2
of
christianson,
the
court
expressly
recited
maybe
our
arising
under
jurisprudence
is
irrelevant
in
this
case
since,
after
all,
we're
only
deciding
whether
the
seventh
circuit
or
the
federal
circuit
should
decide
this
antitrust
case
in
which
the
district
court
invalidated
a
number
of
patents.
and
citing
the
legislative
history
that
the
congress
chose,
for
better
or
for
worse,
to
make
the
referent
of
federal
circuit
jurisdiction
the
same
as
the
referent
of
district
court
jurisdiction
under
1331
and
1338,
under
the
page
and
in
the
passage
that
i
just
read,
this
court
i
believe
specifically
considered
and
decided
that
notwithstanding
that
the
outcome
in
this
type
of
case
is
simply
which
of
two
federal
courts
of
appeals
will
hear
a
case.
nevertheless,
for
better
or
for
worse,
congress
has
decided
that
the
referent
of
federal
circuit
jurisdiction
is
the
same.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
justice
ginsburg,
in
aerojet,
the
federal
circuit
stated,
among
other
things,
that
the
traditional
prerogative
of
the
plaintiff
to
choose
his
law
and
to
choose
his
court
applies
only
to
the
trial
court
level.
the
aerojet
case
said
that
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
fully
exhausted
his
right
to
choose
his
court
and
to
choose
his
law
because
he
had
access
to
a
district
court
forum.
this
court...
this
case
demonstrates
how
that
rationale
of
aerojet
is
mischievous
and
dangerous
and
incorrect.
since
aerojet
in
1989,
there
has
been
a
sea
change
in
the
federal
circuit's
approach
to
what
law
it
chooses
to
apply
in
cases
such
as
this,
and
it
is
the
federal
circuit's
choice
of
law
approach,
adopted
in
the
late
1990's,
which
has
given
birth
to
this
entire
action.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
absolutely
not.
this...
it's
undisputed
that
what--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--precisely.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
that's
absolutely
the
case.
and
the
federal
circuit,
being
a
co-equal
court
of
appeals,
is
fully
entitled,
i
suppose,
to
fashion
its
own
liability
rules
and
apply
them
even
to
claims
over
which
it
has
only
nonexclusive
or
pendent
jurisdiction.
but
by
doing
that,
it
has
given
rise
to
great
incentives,
which
the
respondent
has
attempted
to
avail
itself
of
in
this
case,
to
get
a
case
into
the
federal
circuit
and
take
advantage
of
the
different
law
of
the
federal
circuit
on
a
non-patent
claim.
so,
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
this
court
has
never
wavered
from
the
idea
that
a
person
who
comes
to
court
seeking
relief...
there's
a
lot
of
uncertainty
in
litigation.
i'm
called
upon
to
advise
clients
all
the
time
whether
they
should
or
should
not
bring
suit,
where
they
should
bring
suit,
how
they
should
bring
suit.
the
one
thing
this
court
has
said,
whatever
else
is
uncertain
in
litigation,
the
one
thing
you
know
is,
number
one,
if
you
bring
a
suit,
you
have...
you
are
absolute
master
to
decide
what
law
you're
going
to
rely
on
in
your
complaint.
that's
your
claim.
if
i
specify
the
law
of
california
in
my
complaint,
that's
my
choice.
if
the
plaintiff
specifies
the
law
of
the
tenth
circuit
or
a
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit,
that
is
the
plaintiff's
choice.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
well,
early
in
its
history
the
federal
circuit
seemed
to
be
more
mindful
of
that
type
of
conflict
than
it
is
today.
it's
very
important
that
your
honor
understand.
in
the
midwest
case,
which
fomented
this
whole
thing,
the
1999
midwest
case,
that
was
a
case
that
involved
not
just
federal
law
claims,
that
was
a
case
that
involved
claims
under
iowa
state
law.
and
the
federal
circuit
in
that
case
was
considering
whether
or
not
a
plaintiff
could
properly
claim
trade
dress
protection
for
the
shape
a
boat
trailer
winch
post.
and
the
district
court
had
granted
summary
judgment
dismissing
the
plaintiff's
claims
not
just
under
the
lanham
act,
but
under
iowa
state
law.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
that
is
exactly
what
it
did
in
the
midwest
case.
the
federal
circuit--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--i
invite
your
honor
to
look
at
pages
1564
and
65
of
volume
175
of
federal
3rd,
and
your
honor
will
read
there
that
the
federal
circuit
reversed
a
summary
judgment
under
iowa
state
law
on
the
ground
that
in
its
view
the
federal
patent
law
doesn't
limit
any
claim
that
can
be
asserted
under
iowa
state
law.
and
therefore,
the
district
court
erred
in
not
holding
that
iowa
state
law
could
protect
the
shape
of
a
trailer
winch
post.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
apologize,
mr.
chief
justice.
so,
therefore--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--i
am
not
questioning
that
that
is
what
the
federal
circuit
is
currently
doing,
and
that
it...
it...
i'm
not
questioning
it
has
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
i
cannot
say
that
that
is
a
fair
characterization
of
what
the
bar
generally
holds.
i
believe
that
the
bar
is
very
cautious
in
what
it
says
about
any
court
in
which
it
may
appear
in
front
of.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
it
has
much
greater
practical
significance
now.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
arising
under
basis--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--is...
is
the
same.
we
have
a
bright
line
test.
how
do
we
know
whether
a
case
belongs
in
the
federal
circuit
or
in
any
federal
court?
you
look
at
what's
presented
on
the
place...
on
the
face
of
the
plaintiff's
well-pleaded
complaint.
you
don't
inquire
into
the
plaintiff's
motives
or...
or
spin-out
theories
as
to
why
the
plaintiff
is
doing
what
it's
doing.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
certainly.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
that's
not
how
i
read
cardinal
chemical,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
cardinal
chemical
was
a
straight-up
patent
infringement
case.
the
defendant
in
that
case
asserted
two...
at
least
two
things
in...
in
response
to
the
claim
of
patent
infringement.
the
defendant
in
cardinal
chemical
said,
your
patent
is
invalid,
and
therefore
i'm
not
liable.
and
then,
as
many
defendants
do
nowadays,
the
defendant
in
cardinal
chemical
says,
i
also
want
a
counterclaim
for
declaratory
judgment
that
your
patent
is
invalid.
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
want
that
is
so
that
if
you,
the
plaintiff,
decide
to
pull
the
plug
on
your
suit,
i
can
stay
in
court
on
my
counterclaim.
and
that
was
what
came
up
and
that
was
the
issue.
however,
it's
very
clear
that
since
at
least
1990
the
source
of
a
district
court's
power
to
hear
a
counterclaim
like
that
is
in
1367,
supplemental
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
unquestionably--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--not...
absolutely
not.
1367.
so--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--i
don't
believe
that's
a
correct
statement
of
1367.
i
believe
that
a
federal
court
can
retain--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--that
is
what
happens--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--yes.
but
in
that
situation,
justice
ginsburg,
you're
not
talking
about
nullifying
a
plaintiff's
choice
of
law
and
forum
through
the...
the
assertion
of
a
well-pleaded
complaint.
if
a
plaintiff
asserts
a
defective
complaint
and
shouldn't--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--i
don't
know
that
the
legal
significance
of
the
source
of
a
district
court's
power
to
act
in
that
situation
has
ever
been
a
subject
on
which
any
legal
consequences
followed
so
that
the
body
of
law
that
developed
on
that
would
have
any
precedential
significance
in
this
situation.
the
fact...
the
critical
distinction
between
this
situation
and
the
one
your
honor
is
positing
is
that
in
the
situations
your
honor
is
talking
about,
you're
not
talking
about
a
plaintiff
who
had
a
well-pleaded
complaint
who
he
prevailed
on
being
ousted
of
his
chosen
court
and
forum.
i
don't
believe
that
the
appropriate
disposition
of
a
counterclaim
in
that
situation
sheds
any
light
on
what
should
happen
to
a
plaintiff
who
files
suit
under
non-patent
law
and
wins,
and
the
plaintiff
doesn't
seek
relief
under
federal
patent
law.
the
plaintiff
doesn't
care
what
the
defendant
does
with
other
claims
the
defendant
has.
if
the
respondent
wants
to
have
a
patent
counterclaim,
go
to
the
federal
court
or
litigate
a
federal
patent
counterclaim
in
the
international
trade
commission,
more
power
to
it.
this
suit
was
brought
to
get
preliminary
injunctive
relief
against
threatened,
imminent,
irreparable
harm
to
the
plaintiff's
business
which
was
granted.
there
was
a
preliminary
injunction
that
was
issued
in
january
of
2000,
which
remains
in
effect
to
this
day
upon
the
posting
of
a
$100,000
bond.
the
plaintiff
had
every
right
and
entitlement
to
go
into
court,
to
plead
his
claim
in
the
way
that
the
plaintiff
thought
would
best
accomplish
the
plaintiff's
objectives.
that
is
a
prerogative
which
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
and
over
again
is
the
plaintiff's
right.
no
well-counseled
plaintiff
could
possibly
file
a
lawsuit
without
thinking
what
court
is
most
likely
to
give
me
the
relief
that
i'm
seeking.
that's
not
forum
shopping.
that's
good
lawyering.
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
this
court
has
held
and
the...
the
congressional
choice
of
the
arising
under
referent
for
federal
circuit
jurisdiction
clearly
recognized
that
there
will
be
many,
many
times
when
patent
law
questions
and
patent
law
issues,
including
the
issue
of
validity,
will
be
decided
not
just
in
the
regional
circuits,
but
in
the
state
courts.
would
it
really
have
mattered
in
lear
v.
adkins
if
the
defendant
in
that
case
hadn't
just
said,
the
contract
is
invalid
because
the
patent
is
no
good
and
there's
no
consideration,
if
it
had
filed
a
counterclaim,
as
was
done
in
cardinal
chemical
and
said,
i
want
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
patent
isn't
valid?
no
legal
consequence
should
follow
from
that.
and
in
the
real
world,
justice
ginsburg,
if
a
defendant
really
is
concerned
about
maintaining
its
access
to
the
federal
circuit,
the
defendant
will
file
his
own
suit,
as
your
honor
suggested
in
that--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
w.
dabney
the
respondent...
and...
and
it
was
free
at
all
times
to
pursue
all
available
remedies
in
that
forum
and
that's
not...
that's
not
even
in
question
at
this
point.
but
just
as
the
respondent
was
free
to
choose
a
forum
that
it
thought
was
most
favorable
to
it,
which,
by
the
way,
would
have
been
subject
to
federal
circuit
review,
so
was
the
petitioner.
and
the
petitioner
filed
suit
in
accordance
with
the
rules.
it
got
a
judgment.
it
won,
and
it's
had
its
judgment
taken
away
by
a
court
that
clearly
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
controversy.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
in
response
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
kennedy,
there
is
no
difference
between
different
interpretation
and
adaptation.
the
respondent's
position
would
call
for
this
court
to
retreat
from
christianson
and
to
adopt
some
special
interpretation
of
arising
under
unique
to
1338(a)
that
deviates
from
the
arising
under
language
as
it
was
clearly
adopted
by
congress
in
1295.
secondly,
with
regard
to
the
question
of...
of
federal
circuit
choice
of
law,
what
mr.
gowdey
stood
here...
i
just
would
call...
call
your
honors'
attention
to
page
94a
of
the
joint
appendix
which
is
the
district
court's
opinion
in
this
case
in
which
the
district
court
says,
vornado...
that's
the
respondent...
contends
that
this
change
in
the
law
exception
is
met
because
in
midwest
industries,
the
federal
circuit
expressly
rejected
the
tenth
circuit's
vornado
i
holding,
ruling
instead
that
a
claim
for
trade
dress
protection
was
not
barred
by
the
fact
that
a
product
configuration
has
been
claimed
as
a
significant
inventive
element
of
the
patent.
as
part
of
its
ruling
in
that
case,
the
federal
circuit
abandoned
its
prior
practice
of
applying
regional
circuit
law
on
questions
involving
the
relationship
between
patent
law
and
other
federal
law
rights
and
said,
quote,
henceforth,
we
will
apply
our
own
law
to
such
questions.
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
federal
circuit
has
recently
and
radically
changed
how
it
adjudicates
trade
dress
claims,
and
it
was
the
opportunity
to
try
to
take
advantage
of
the...
of
the
federal
circuit's
view
of
trade
dress
protection
which
was
before
the
court
in
the
traffix
case,
and
rejected
by
the
court
in
the
traffix
case,
which
drove
the
case
that's
currently
before
the
court,
which
isn't
to
say
that
the
federal
circuit
can't
do
that.
but
by
doing
that,
whatever
legitimacy
could
have
been
before
it,
even
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
justice
scalia,
in
derogation
of
clearly
expressed
congressional
intent,
in
1989,
the
federal
circuit
has
done
a
180
degree
u-turn
in
its
approach
to
its
choice
of
law
in
these
matters.
and
therefore,
the...
a
critical
underpinning
of
the
aerojet
principle
has
been
completely
wiped
out.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
that...
it
is
the
issue
that
was
before
this
court
in
the
traffix
case.
it
is
a
question
of
how
far
state
law,
how
far
federal
law
can
properly
go
in
allowing
a
company
like
the
respondent
to
claim
unregistered,
judge-made--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--the
federal--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--the
federal
circuit
has
taken
the
position
that...
i'm
sorry.
my
time
is
up.
may
i
answer
the
question?
mr.
james
w.
dabney
the
federal
circuit
has
taken
the
position
that
federal
patent
law
does
not
create
any
right
to
copy
or
use
anything,
and
therefore,
it
was
wrong
for
the
court
in
midwest
to
say
that
iowa
state
law
could
not
protect
that.
