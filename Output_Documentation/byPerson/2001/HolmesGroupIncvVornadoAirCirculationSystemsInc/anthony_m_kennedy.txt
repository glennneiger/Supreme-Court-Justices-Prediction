well,
then
that
means
we
interpret,
under
your
view,
arising
under
in
different
ways
in
the...
in
the
patent
statute
and
in...
in
the
federal
jurisdiction
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
difference
in
interpreting
a
different
way
and
adapting?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
district
court
has
to
decide
which
of
two
different
circuits'
laws
you're
going
to
follow,
i
guess
he
knows
what
the
case
is
going
to
look
like
at
the
end...
or
she.
maybe...
maybe
the
trial
judge
doesn't
because
the
trial
doesn't
know
which
circuit
to
follow,
so
he
doesn't
know
how
it's
going
to
come
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
circular
analysis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
it
used
to
do.
you
say
they...
you
think
it's
still
doing
that?
it's
still
following
circuit
rule
on
non-patent
law
issues?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
so,
now
the
trial
judge
has
to
say,
well,
there
may
be
two
circuits
involved
here.
one
is
my
own
circuit
and
it's
not
related,
and
so
the
federal
circuit
won't
control,
but
if
it's
somehow
related
to
the
patent
claim,
then
the
federal
circuit
would...
so,
this...
this
is
a
further
metaphysical
exercise.
this...
this
is
great
for
the
legal
profession
actually.
