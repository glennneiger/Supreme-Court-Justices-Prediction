it--
justice

suppose
you
did
do
that,
which...
i
mean,
suppose
you
took
justice
stevens'
concurring
view
in
christianson,
which
was
a
view
that
would
come
closer
to
doing
what
you
want.
it
would
make
sense.
you'd
look
at
the...
look
at
the
case
after
it's
decided
in
the
district
court
to
see
where...
whether
there's
a
patent
claim.
you'd
still
lose
here,
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
farther?
because
i
would
go
just
as
far
as
he
went.
you
went
just
as
far
as
he
went.
you
look
at
the
whole
thing
after
it's
decided.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
how
could
you
go
further
than
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
will...
you
will
have
the
situation
then
in
which
the
district
judge
is...
is
going
to
have
to
defy
the
law
of
his
circuit
on
a...
on
the
non-patent
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
claim
is...
and
i...
i
will
be
candid
to
say
i'm
not
in
a
position
to...
to
evaluate
this
claim
because
i
haven't
gone
back
and
looked
at...
at
many
of
the
cases
on
it
to
find
out
what's
really
going
on.
but
i
mean,
the
claim
is
made
that
the
federal
circuit
is
not
doing
that.
