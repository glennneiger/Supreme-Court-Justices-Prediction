justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
assuming
they
could
have
separate
judgments
under
54(b).
is
that
what
your
point
is
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
but
if
there
were
a
single
judgment
which
did
include
the
patent
claim,
then
i
think
you'd
say
the
appeal
would
go
to
the
federal
circuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
not?
i
mean,
what
are
you
giving
up
in
your
case
by
agreeing
to
that?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
may
i
interrupt
and
ask
a
kind
of
a
basic
question
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
prevail
on
either
of
two
theories,
that...
that
the
counterclaim
should
be
ignored
for
purposes
of
selecting
the
appellate
court
to
go
to,
or
you
could
say
that
in
this
particular
case,
you
got
a
54(b)
judgment
that
had...
was
totally
unrelated
to
patent
claims
and
therefore,
in
this
case,
regardless
of
whether
we
agree
with
aerojet
or
the
rest,
you
should
prevail.
but
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
even
if
the
counterclaim
had
been
decided
and
adjudicated
on
a
patent
issue,
that
you...
it
would
be
the
same
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
relying
on
the
fact
that...
that
there
was
a
severance
of
the
non-patent
claims
under...
with
a
54(b)
finding,
that
it
was
a
separate
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
not
asking
us
to
rule
on
that
basis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this...
just
a
question
about
the
history
of
what
we've
got
before
us?
am
i
correct
in
believing
that
until
the
federal
circuit
changed
its
view
and
started
to
apply
its
own
law
to
non-patent
issues
as
opposed
to
applying
other
circuits'
law
when
the
case
arose
in
another
circuit,
the
bar
generally
was
totally
happy
with
the
rule
that
the
counterclaim
would...
counterclaim
alleging
a
patent
claim
would
be
sufficient
to
give
appellate
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so,
it
is
true
that
this...
this
has
become
a
much
more
important
problem
since
they
changed
the...
their
rule
on
what
they
do
with
the
ancillary
claims.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
jurisdiction
rule
is
the
same
in
either
event.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
at
the
time
aerojet
was
decided,
they
did
that.
but
i
thought
there
was
a
recent...
in
the
last
year
or
2,
they
had
taken
a
different
view
and
were
applying
their
own
law
as
opposed
to
the
tenth
circuit
law
in
this
case
on
the
non-patent
law
issues.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
seems
somewhat
inconsistent
with
the
last
part
of
1295(a),
which
in
effect
says
that
when
it's
a
non-patent
law
issue,
they...
the
1291
and
the
1292
and
1294
shall
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
