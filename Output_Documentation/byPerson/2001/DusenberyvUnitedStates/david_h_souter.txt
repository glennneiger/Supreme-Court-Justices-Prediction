with
that
if
that
had
been
the
case
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
even
even
though
there
was
i
was
going
to
say
even
though
there
was
no
receipt
signature,
but
i
guess
under
the
procedures
now,
the
the
prisoner
would
have
signed
a
log.
justice
david
h.
souter
take
it
you
your
argument
would
be
that
even
if
all
the
signatures
we-
are
are
not
required
in
the
in
rem
case,
there
is
there
is
a
fairness
in
the
procedure
that
would
not
require
actual
notice
and
signatures
to
every
ship
owner
because
the
owner
of
the
ship
at
least
has
some
right
to
control
the
ship.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
long
as
he
wins.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
would
you
would
you
would
be
satisfied
if
if
we
had
the
i
i
take
it,
the
same
kind
of
demand
for
proof
of
regularity
for
the
period
between
the
front
door
of
the
prison
and
the
prisoner's
cell
that
we
do
from
the
mailbox
to
the
front
door
of
the
prison.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
signature
requirement,
but
basically
we
we
would
have
the
same
kind
of
rule
then
that
we
have
i-
with
with
respect
to
mail
delivery
in
general.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
any
part
of
your
argument
that
we
should
be
suspicious
of
prison
officials
because
they
may
use
a
refusal
to
follow
their
procedures
for
vindictive
reasons
or
anything
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
be
difficult
if
you're
going
to
take
twenty
thousand
dollars
away
from
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
minear,
we
have
a
smattering
of
courts
of
appeals
cases
addressing
the
issue
that
we've
got
today,
but
beyond
that,
i
don't
know
how
much
litigation
there
is
about
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
i
i
don't
know
that
the
that
that
argument
really
favors
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
there
can
be
an
institutional
consideration
in
a
closed
case
in
deciding
what
due
process
does
require?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
said
that
because
there
is
a
gap
between
mail
delivery
to
a
prison
and
delivery
to
a
prisoner
and,
for
that
reason,
there
must
be
some
indication
of
the
procedure
for
getting
the
mail
to
the
prisoner,
then
you
might
have
a
a
problem
and
there
might
be
an
institutional
advantage
in
a
signature
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
understand
why
it's
it's
intuitively
obvious
that
ordinary
mail
suffices
when
we
have
a
situation
here
which
is
different
from
the
situation
covered
by
the
the
ordinary
mail.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
understand
it,
did
not
stop
with
proof
that
the
letter
was
mailed.
