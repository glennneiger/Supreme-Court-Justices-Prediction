well

that's
going
to
happen
sometimes
with
any

of

the
requirement

we've
never

that
destroyed

one
of
the
difficulties
i
find
with
your
position
ms.

is
that
this
inquiry
can
come
up,
you
know,
months
and
maybe
years
after
the
actual
notice
took
place
or
didn't
take
place.

00-6567,
dusenbery
against
the
united
states.
the
issue
before
us
in
this
case
is
whether
the
fbi's
sending
of
a
forfeiture
notice
by
certified
mail
to
a
prisoner
housed
at
a
federal
correctional
facility
with
procedures
for
delivering
the
mail
to
its
inmate
satisfies
due
process.
we
hold
that
it
does.
petitioner
was
arrested
in
1986
at
a
house
trailer
in
ohio.
later
that
day
fbi
officers
executed
a
search
warrant
for
the
premises
and
seized
drugs,
guns,
miscellaneous
property
items
in
a
total
of
some
$21,000
in
cash.
two
years
after
the
petitioner
pleaded
guilty
to
drug
possession
charges,
the
fbi
obtained
an
order
from
the
district
court
to
destroy
the
firearms
which
were
no
longer
needed
as
evidence,
and
started
the
process
of
administratively
forfeiting
the
cash
and
other
properties
seized
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
it
sent
notice
of
its
intention
to
forfeit
the
cash
by
certified
mail
to
petitioner
at
the
federal
prison
where
he
was
being
held.
it
also
published
legal
notice
for
three
weeks
in
a
cleveland
newspaper.
the
fbi
received
no
response
from
these
notices
and
so
it
declared
the
cash
forfeited.
nearly
five
years
later,
petitioner
sought
return
of
this
property
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
held
the
fbi's
notice
by
certified
mail
satisfied
due
process.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
this
case
is
governed
by
the
principle
announced
in
mullane
versus
central
hanover
bank
&
trust
company.
there
we
said
that
when
the
government
seeks
to
deprive
persons
of
property,
the
due
process
clause
requires
notice
reasonably
calculated
under
all
the
circumstances.
to
apprise
interested
parties
of
the
pendency
of
the
action
and
afford
them
an
opportunity
to
present
their
objection.
in
this
case,
the
government
showed
that
notice
was
sent
by
certified
mail
to
petitioner
at
the
correctional
facility
where
he
was
located.
at
that
facility,
prison
mail
room
staff
went
to
the
city
post
office
everyday
to
pick
up
inmate
mail,
sign
for
the
certified
mail
and
entered
it
in
a
prison
mail
room
logbook.
a
member
of
the
inmate'
unit
team
then
sign
for
the
certified
mail
before
taking
it
in
from
the
mail
room
and
delivering
it
the
inmate
during
mail
call.
the
fbi's
method
of
sending
the
notice
was
reasonably
calculated,
we
hold
to
apprise
petitioner
the
fortifier.
the
claim
by
petitioner
that
he
did
not
actually
received
the
letter
is
insufficient
to
render
the
notice
constitutionally
defective.
none
of
our
cases
have
required
proof
of
receipt
instead
the
government
may
defend
its
chosen
method
on
the
ground
that
it
is
reasonably
certain
to
inform
those
effected.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices

souter
and
