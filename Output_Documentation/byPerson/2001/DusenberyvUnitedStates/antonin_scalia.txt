ms.
zieve,
i'm
i'm
not
sure
what
what
is
the
general
principle
of
which
you
assert
the
rule
that
you
urge
upon
us
in
this
case
is
is
just
an
exemplar.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
ur-
urging
that
when
the
that
that
that
the
distinctive
factor
is
just
the
government
is
in
charge
of
the
delivery
system
because
that
would
have
been
the
case
in
the
old
post
office
when
when
the
post
office
was
actually
part
of
the
federal
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
what
is
the
principle
wh-
when
the
government
is
in
charge
of
the
residence?
right?
so
so
so
we
would
need
a
similar
rule
for
all
members
of
the
armed
forces.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
you
you
ch-
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
neither
one
alone
is
enough,
i
don't
know
why
all
in
combination
turn
out
to
be
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
apply
to
all
members
of
the
armed
forces.
justice
antonin
scalia
apply
to
the
amed
forces...
justice
antonin
scalia
think
that
that's
realistic
here?
y-
you
you
would
not
urge
us
to
apply
this
rule
in
a
civil
action
where
your
client
was
being
served
a
paper
by
by
by
someone
who
is
not
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
urged
the
rule
in
that
case,
only
when
the
government
is
is
the
opposing
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
like
this
one
except
that
the
complaint
was
not
on
behalf
of
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
assert
that
your
rule
would
apply
in
that
situation
or
not?
all
of
the
circumstances
are
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
they
might
say
more
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
and
which
would
not
be
the
case,
i
suppose,
unless
you're
going
to
adopt
the
certified
mail
rule,
which
would
not
be
the
case
for
an
ordinary
citizen
who
is
not
incarcerated.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
that's
not
part
of
your
argument,
i
don't
see
why
your
situation
is
any
different
from
the
military
situation
where,
unless
the
unless
the
serviceman
or
woman
is
awol,
the
government
knows
r-
right
where
that
person
is
and
the
government
is
responsible
for
for
where
that...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
you
wouldn't
have
the
same
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
minear,
am
am
i
correct
that
the
that
the
current
method
of
simply
providing
written
notice
is
you
you
maintain
that
that
is
method
that
congress
has
specified
in
nineteen
usc
six
sixteen
oh
seven
a?
justice
antonin
scalia
shall
be
sent.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
how
does
one
normally
send
things?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
say
shall
be
sent
by
certified
mail.
justice
antonin
scalia
problem
if
we
if
we
held
the
way
you've
asked
us
to
hold.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
reasonable
for
the
government
to
assume
that
the
state
prison
procedures
are
adequate
to
get
mail
to
state
prisoners.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
held
that
this
is
a
reasonable
sending
it
by
mail
is
a
reasonable
way
to
do
it,
you
wouldn't
have
any
more
of
an
institutional
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
minear,
are
there
do
you
know
whether
there
are
more
prisoners
incarcerated
in
prisons
than
there
are
college
students
living
in
dormitories
who
to
whom
the
mail
is
not
delivered
personally
or
or
individuals
living
in
high
rise
apartment
buildings
where
the
mail
is
is
sorted
downstairs
and
not
delivered
by
the
by
the
postman
to
their
to
their
own
room?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
those
people,
just
as
it
is
for
prisoners.
