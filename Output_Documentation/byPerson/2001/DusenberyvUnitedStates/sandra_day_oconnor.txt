well,
you
take
the
position
that
it's
not
sufficient
that
there
be
staff
at
the
prison
who
deliver
mail
to
the
inmates?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
procedure...
i
ne-
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
whereby
a
prison
employee
delivers
certified
mail
to
prisoners
is
inadequate
in
your...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
be
under
any
of
our
case
law,
that
that
would
be
inadequate
per
se?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
statutory
requirement
in
your
view
for
forfeiture?
as
as
far
as
notice
is
concerned?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
mail?
what
what
is
the
general
statutory
requirement
on
these
forfeiture
notices?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
materials
we
have
in
the
briefs?
is
there
some
copy
of
that
provision
somewhere
that
you're
aware
of
in
the
briefs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
take
a
lot
of
time
if
you
don't
know.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
perhaps
you
knew.

justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
me
we
need
to
focus
on
some
kind
of
a
test,
and
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
argue
for
a
test
that
says
in
these
prison
cases,
there
has
to
be
actual
receipt
by
the
prisoner.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
isn't
adequate
unless
there's
actual
n-
receipt.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
don't
agree
with
you,
what's
your
fall-back
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
is
it
that
a
procedure
is
inadequate
if
the
procedure
is
that
if
we
get
certified
mail,
we
we
deliver
it
to
the
prisoner?
what's
inadequate
about
that
as
a
procedural
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
look
back
at
mullane
or
at
mathews
versus
eldridge
for
our
guidance
here
in
establishing
a
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
third
circuit
has
apparently
adopted
a
test
that
requires
the
government
to
show
a
little
more
than
that
it
dropped
a
notice
in
the
mail,
and
that,
in
fact,
the
government
must
show
that
procedures
at
the
receiving
facility,
the
prison,
were
reasonably
calculated
to
deliver
notice
to
the
intended
recipient.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
a
a
standard
that
the
government
would
find
satisfactory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
think
the
sixth
circuit
standard
differs
from
the
third
circuit's
and
the
fourth's?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
here
the
government
is
seeking
to
forfeit
property
from
someone.
