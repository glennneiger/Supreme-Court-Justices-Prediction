mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
that
is
in
fact
what
the
court
did.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
required,
but
the
inquiry
was
made,
and
the
court
concluded
that
whatever
the
protestations
of
the
defendant
might
be,
or
the
prisoner
in
this
case,
nevertheless
the
method
that
was
used
here
was
reasonably
calculated
to
reach
him.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
the
problem
with
that
position
is
it's
contrary
to
fifty
years
of
this
court's
precedent,
which
has
consistently
recognized
that
mailing
alone
not
certified
mail
but
ordinary
mail,
is
sufficient
to
provide
parties
with
notice.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
are
certainly
s-
willing
to
defend
the
proposition
that
the
federal
rules
of
procedure,
which...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
court
can
certainly
do
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
court
has
drawn
these
principles
largely
from
common
experience
and
knowledge
about
the
instrumentalities
that
are
used
for
purposes
of
service.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
n-
actually
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
mullane
has
been
extended
beyond
the
facts
of
its
individual
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
w-
well,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but,
your
honor,
the
same
could
be
said,
for
instance,
in
mennonite
with
regard
to
the
mortgagee,
that
the
person
who
is
at
that
that
was
a
situation
in
which
there
was
an
interest
in
in
foreclosing
on
a
property
and
selling
it
at
a
tax
sale.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
and
that's
the
reason
why
the
government
in
these
situations
provides
notice
by
publication,
also
by
notice
to
the
person's
last
address,
and
also
notice
to
his
current
address
if
it
can
be
acertained
in
this
case,
the
government,
w-
through
region-
reasonable
diligence,
was
able
to
locate
the
individual
and
send
notice
to
his
place
of
incarceration.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
argument
against
that,
your
honor,
is
that
the
due
process
clause
simply
specifies
the
constitutional
minimum.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
reason
there
there
are
several
reasons
for
not
recognizing
a
general
constitutional
standard.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
rule
would,
first
of
all,
require,
for
instance,
as
the
chief
justice
has
pointed
out,
similar
nerv-
er
knowl-
service
on
the
armed
services.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
also
would
apply
to
other
situations
that
might
not
be
documented
in
the
record.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
cannot
say
that
the
government
cannot
overcome
that
difficulty
because
it
does
in
fact
use
certified
mail.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
bu-
your
honor,
but
again,
this
case
is
on
on
par
with
other
cases
that
involved
similar
amounts
of
money.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
disagree
with
that,
your
honor,
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
judge
alito's
dissenting
opinion
on
on
that
ground,
namely,
that
it
imposes
burdens
that
are
not
necessary.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
reason...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
don't
know
of
any
state
that
allows
ordinary
mail.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
return
receipt
re-
requested.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
on
that
o-
on
that
approach.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
we
certainly
do
think
it
falls
on
the
side
of
the
th-
of
the
line
that
this
other
c-
that
the
other
cases
of
this
court
demarks,
namely
probate
proceedings,
tax
sales,
condemnation
proceedings,
notice
forcible
entry
and
detainer
proceedings,
such
as
which
are
basically
e-
e-
ejectment
proceedings.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'm
not
aware
of
any
special
procedures
that
that
we
provide
in
those
situations.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
and
i'm
not
sure
how
that
would
apply
in
this
situation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yeah.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
for
a
short
while
the
dea
and
the
fbi
did
follow
the
practice
of
denominating
certain
mails
as
special
mail.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
they
do
not,
although
i
think
that
the
the
the
court
can
can
safely
assume
that
state
prisons
do,
in
fact,
provide
for
mail
delivery
to
their
prisoners.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
th-
there's
no
reason
to
depart
that's
certainly
the
the
fact
that
we
know
where
the
person
is,
certainly
does
dictate
that
we
contact
the
person
by
mail,
and
that's
inconsistent
with
mullane
and
its
progeny,
that
where
the
address
is
reasonably
ascertainable
the
person
should
be
contacted
by
mail.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
if
it
does,
it
doesn't
really
matter
if
he's
at
a
location
of
our
choosing
or
some
other
location.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
not
under
the
tort
claims
act
because
it
does
exclude
intentional
torts.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
tha-
under
negligence?
there
is
conceivably
an
an
opportunity
to
seek
damages
based
on
negligence,
although
you'd
have
to
show
an
absence
of
of
due
care.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
method
of
provi-
the
requirement
of
providing
written
notice
i
believe
is
in
eighteen
eighty-one,
on
page
three
of
our
briefs.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mistaken.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
three,
and
the
fir-
at
the
end
of
the
first
indented
paragraph.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
shall
be
sent.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
normally
by
mail,
and
we
think
that...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor,
there's
primary
primarily
a
question
of
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
government
met
that
burden
in
this
case,
but
again,
we
don't
think
that
that
should
be
the
test.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
i
think
that
you
know,
that
the
department
of
justice,
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
in
particular,
has
tried
to
be
helpful
in
that
regard
with
re-
with
regard
to
providing
this
types
of
process.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
certainly
is
a
factor
that
the
court
could
weigh,
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well
well,
no.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
there
are
also
state
prisons
that
do
need
to
determine
what
procedures
they
would
follow.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
it
is
reasonably
calculated.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
no,
we
wouldn't.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well
well,
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
i
think
what
what
you
see
here
is
the
the
proceedings
below
validated
the
fact
that
ordinary
mail
would
suffice,
the
fact
that...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
perhaps
the
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
is
that
this
court
can
certainly
affirm
the
decision
below
and
say
that
the
procedures
below
were
adequate.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
obviously,
if
there
is
if
there
is
reason
to
believe
by
the
party
that's
sending
notice
the
mail
will
not
that
ordinary
mailers
will
not
suffice,
then
due
process
may
require
that
additional
steps
be
taken.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
it
would
for
this
reason,
that
if
a
return
address
is
provided
and
the
mail
is
not
delivered
by
the
hospital,
we
can
expect
the
hospital
to
send
the
mail
return
it
to
sender.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
okay.
