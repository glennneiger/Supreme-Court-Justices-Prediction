ms.
allison
m.
zieve
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
procedures
used
to
serve
notice
of
forfeiture
of
petitioner's
property
satisfied
due
process.
the
federal
government
forfeited
mr.
dusenbery's
twenty-two
thousand
dollars
in
nineteen
eighty-eight
after
mailing
a
notice
to
him
at
the
federal
prison
where
he
was
incarcerated.
it's
not
disputed
that
he
did
not
get
the
notice.
the
governor
the
government
argues
that
its
nineteen
eighty-eight
procedures
satisfied
due
process
whether
or
not
the
notice
was
received.
however,
in
light
of
the
circumstances
presented
here,
including
the
government's
control
over
the
prisoner's
location
and
knowledge
of
the
prisoner's
location
at
all
times
and
its
control
over
prison
procedures,
due
process
requires
the
government
to
use
procedures
that
offer
assurances
of
delivery
to
the
inmate
addressee
and
not
just
to
prison
personnel.
such
procedures...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that,
in
and
of
itself,
is
not
sufficient.
there
the
the
procedures
need...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that
that,
in
and
of
itself,
is
inadequate.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
is
inadequate,
although...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
the
circumst-
under
this
court's
case
law,
what's
required
w-
when
the
notice
is
served
is
determined
by
a
consideration
of
a
balance
of
factors
in
light
of
the
circumstances.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
no,
although
there
is
some
suggestion
of
that
in
in
a
couple
cases,
for
instance,
phillips
petroleum.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
in
the
circumstances
presented
here,
consideration
of
the
balance
of
factors
leads
to
a
requirement
the
procedures
that
would
satisfy
thao-
those
factors
would
also
lead
to
actual
notice.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
yes.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
yes,
he
would
have
signed
a
log.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that's
correct.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
the
special
mail
o-
opened
only
in
front
of
the
prisoners
is
happens
after
it's
delivered
to
the
prisoner.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
your
honor,
that's
one
important
factor,
but
the
case
here
is
even
easier
because
there
are
s-
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that's
not
the
only
factor.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
there
are
several
key
factors
here,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
separate
out
one
circumstance
from
the
rest.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
because
that's
the
circumstances.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
the
procedures
used
for
delivery
are
also
determined
by
the
government,
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
and
the
government
is
in
an
adverse
position,
which
i
think
requires
additional
cross
checks
in
the
system
to
ensure
that
care
is
taken
because
the
government
doesn't
have
incentive
to
identify
and
rectify
inefficiencies
on
its
own.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
if
the
s-
if
the
serving
party
were
not
the
government,
then
the
person
doing
the
service
would
not
be
the
person
who
was
also
in
control
of
the
delivery...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
i'm
not
trying
to
be
evasive,
but
it's
hard
to
answer
without
knowing
all
the
circumstances
there.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
private
individual
wouldn't
have
control
over
the
procedures...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that
mailing
wasn't...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
wasn't
adequate
in
that
circumstance.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
if
it
might
not
apply
in
that
circumstance,
but
whether
or
not
it
does,
this
is
an
easier
case.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
no.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
i
think
if
probably
not
adequate
in
any
civil
suit.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
this...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
not
exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
if
the
mail
is
received
by
the
inmate?
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
the
mailed
notice
is
any
form
of
delivery
any
form
of
notice
is
adequate
as
to
that
individual
if
it's
received.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
the
first
case
where
the
court
considers
whether
mailed
notices
is
constitutional
in
hess
versus
pawloski,
the
the
mail
at
issue
was
certified
mail.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
that's
why
the
procedures
should
require
proof
of
verification
which
the
government's
procedures
do
today.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
under
the
circumstances.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
the
nineteen
eighty-eight
procedures
did
not
provide
assurances
of
delivery
because
what
happened
after
the
m-
mail
reached
the
mail
room
is
was
vague
and
undocumented.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
the
procedure
was
that
the
emp-
mail
room
employee
picked
up
the
mail
and
signed
the
certified
mail
receipt
at
the
post
office,
brought
it
back
to
the
prison,
where
he
entered
it
in
a
log
book.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
a
prison
employee
testified
that
in
nineteen
eighty-eight
the
procedure
then
would
have
been
that
a
a
housing
unit
staff
would
have
signed
when
he
took
the
mail
the
certified
mail
out
of
the
mail
room.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
he
also
testified
that
he
didn't
know
what
the
procedure
was
after
that.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
the
procedure
doesn't
require
verification
of
delivery...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
yes,
and
the
reason
is
this.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
in
[ns]
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
th-
in
mullane
and
in
in
some
cases
where
there's
a
class
of
interested
parties
where
everyone
has
this
same
interest,
it
might
not
be
necessary
for
all
interested
parties
to
receive
the
notice.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
that
would
likely
be
reasonable
since
the
burden
of
doing
so
is
so
small
and
the
increased
th-
the
decreased
risk
of
it
not
reaching
the
addressee
would
be...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
i-
it
wasn't
good
enough
in
in
these
circumstances.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
i-
e-
yeah,
it
would
still
mean
the
forfeiture
was
done...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
i
don't
know
that
it
would
be
adequate
notice
to
serve
someone
by
mail
out
of
prison
if
it's
not
received.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
publication
and
notice
to
the
interested
party.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
i
believe
the
statute
says
by
mail,
although
for
the
government
always
does
it
by
certified
mail.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
it's
on
page
three
of
the
government's...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
it
just
says,
shall
be
sent
to
each
party
who
appears
to
have
an
interest.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
under
the
statute?
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well
now,
you've
asked
a
sort
of
complicated
question
because
the
statute
for
an
in
rem
judicial...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
requires
publication,
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
the
government,
based
on
this
court's
case
law,
gives
notice
by
certified
mail.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
e-
yes.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
probably.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
yes,
but
the
reason
that
i
emphasize
the
signature
is
because,
e-
as
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
since
recognized,
the
the
signature
does
help
to
improve
delivery.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
actually
the
board
of
prisons
procedures
deal
with
that,
and
i
think
effectively,
which
is
the
on
the
log
book,
if
the
prisoner
refuses
to
sign,
then
the
person
delivering
the
mail
signs
for
it
stating
that
the
prisoner
won't
sign,
which
i
think
is
comparable
to
a
process
server
giving
a
contemporaneous
statement
that...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
they
have
to
be
adequate.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
yes,
because
those
procedures
are
it's
entirely
practicable
to
do
that.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
even
under
the
third
circuit's
formulation,
the
court,
c-
looking
at
the
nineteen
eighty-eight
procedures
in
the
record,
such
as
they
are
those
procedures
were
inadequate.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
again,
it
doesn't
provide
the
assurances
of
delivery
that
both
are
feasible
because,
if
you're
going
to
deliver
it,
it
doesn't
take
that
much
to
just
get
the
signature,
and
because
i
think
it's
important
to
have
cross
checks
to
make
sure
that
the
government...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
i
think
either
one,
your
honor.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
there
may
be
other
cases,
though
there
also
may
not
be.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
no,
i
haven't.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that
may
occur,
your
honor,
but
our
argument
does...
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well
considered
the
military
situation,
and
maybe
there's
more
parallels.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
[ns]
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
address
the
the
suggestion
that
these
cases
are
about
false
claims.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
thank
you.
