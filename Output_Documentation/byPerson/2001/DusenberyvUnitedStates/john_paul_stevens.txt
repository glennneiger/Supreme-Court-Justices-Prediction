ask
you
this
prompted
by
justice
scalia's
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
should
think
there
a
lot
of
mail
that
might
addressed
to
a
serviceman
might
be
signed
for
by
the
mail
orderly
or
something.

federal
system,
but
the
rule
we're
working
with
today
would
apply
to
state
forfeitures
as
well,
the
state
prisons
and
the
like.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
just
comment
on
the
suggestion
that
your
opponent
has
made,
in
effect,
that
there
really
ought
to
be
a
special
rule
for
people
who
are
in
the
custody
of
the
federal
government?
and
i
would
assume
with
justice
scalia
that
would
include
military
personnel
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
position
on
one
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mail
was
not
always
routinely
delivered
to
prisoners.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
put
it
on
the
shelf
and
not
even
give
it
to
the
prisoner
and
there
would
be
no
remedy
at
all.
