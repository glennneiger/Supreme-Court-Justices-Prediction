the
procedure
that
was
in
place
for
certain
kinds
of
mail

was
labeled
special
mail

that
had
been

that
had

in
this
category

special
mail,
as
i
understand
it,
could
be
opened
only
in
the
presence
of
the
prisoner?

and
if
that
had
applied,
that
old
rule
had
applied
to
this
category
of
mail,
you
would
not
object
to
that,
would
you?

that
the
the
prisoner
owed
money
and
the
creditor
brought
this...

you
couldn't
say
every
case
because
in
mullane
i-
regular
mail
was
adequate
in
that
under
the
circumstances,
which
was
th-
heavily
emphasized
by

those
words,
under
the

rule
to
any
setting
other
than
prisons
or
are
you
ta-
talking
about
the
circumstances
of
someone
incarcerated
by
the
government?
is
there
any
other
setting
in
which
you
would
require
not
merely
that
certified
mail
be
sent
and
signed
for
by
someone,
but
in-hand
delivery?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
easy
case?
it
is
the
case,
i
take
it
from
your
argument,
because
you
haven't
suggested
that
there
might
be
another
setting
other
than
where
the
government
has
someone
in
confinement.

i'm
i'm
just
very
puzzled
by
your
reliance
on
mullane
when
justice

s-
took
took
such
care
to
say
this
procedure,
common
trust
fund,
so
many
beneficiaries,
some
unknown,
some
addresses
lost
if
we
use
regular
mail,
the
chances
are
it
will
get
to
many,
if
not
most,
people
in
the
group,
and
that's
good
enough
for
that
kind
of
case.

generally.
justice
ruth

publication
is
is
the
least
effective,
and
the
mullane
case
that
you
rely
on
so
heavily
makes
that
point.

about
the

there's
an

the

could
assert

justice

ask
you
a
question
that
puzzles
me
about
this?
the
even
before
the
current
regulations,
there
was
this
special
mail
category
and
several
things
fell
into
it,
including
letters
that
the
prisoner
would
get
from
the
attorney.

category
called
law
enforcement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear,
w-
in
the
in
the
hospital
setting,
the
government
has
a
claim
against
someone,
knows
that
person
is
hospitalized,
sends
ordinary
mail
to
the
hospital
for
the
contract
claim,
the
tort
claim,
whatever.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
we
know
is
that
this
mail
well,
i
think
your
time
is
up.
