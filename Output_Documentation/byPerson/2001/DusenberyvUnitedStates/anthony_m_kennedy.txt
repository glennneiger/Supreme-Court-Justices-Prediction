well,
let
let
me
ask
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
same
thing
i
i
i
are
we
supposed
to
write
an
opinion
that
that
says
that
mailed
notice
is
adequate
in
any
civil
suit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
from
a
constitutional
sta-
i
know
what
four
e
says,
but
from
a
constitutional
standpoint,
is
mailed
notice
adequate
in
any
civil
suit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
what
is
it
that
about
this
that
makes
mailed
notice
adequate
whereas
a-
apparently
there's
another
class
of
cases
in
which
personal
service
is
required?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
begin
i
i
i
think
with
the
assumption
that
mailed
notice
would
be
adequate,
and
the
question
is,
are
these
mailing
procedures
adequate
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
i
d-
i
don't
want
to
have
you
take
a
position
you
don't
take.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
mail
adequate
at
all?
you
seem
to
assume
that,
and
that's
fine.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
any
civil
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
th-
then
we-
su-
whe-
then
whenever
there's
a
requirement
of
s-
or
or
a
requirement
procedure
for
a
service
by
mail,
it
should
be
certified
mail
so
the
person
signs
for
it
in
every
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
not
be
certified.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
three
of
government's...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
with
reference
to
a
simple
contract
or
tort
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
i'm
asking
because
in
in
mullane
and
subsequent
cases,
we
have
tended
to
say
that
the
in
rem
in
personam
distinction
is
is
not
too
clear
a
line.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
due
process
c-
requirements
now.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
if
this
court
writes
a
due
process
opinion,
can
we
say
that
mail,
is
or
routine
mail,
is
always
sufficient,
or
are
there
some
cases
in
which
you
must
have
personal
service?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
principle
is
that
you're
tha-
that
that
controls
our
case,
the
the
beginning
principle
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
relying
on
th-
the
fact
that
this
is
a
forfeiture
case
and
we're
ther-
there's
this
voice
of
the
past
of
in
rem
versus
in
personam
hanging
over
this
this
argument
of
yours.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
probate
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
is
premised
on
the
fact
that
forfeiture
is
like
an
in
rem
proceeding
and
it's
just
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no-
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
heroic
assumption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
unavailability
or
the
fact
that
the
person
is
avoiding
the
process
server
or
something
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
