justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i-
we-
u-
we-
v-
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
don't
say
under
the
s-
there's
no
such
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
calculated
to
give
actual
notice
reasonably?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
the
proce-
what
what
tell
me
precisely.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mhm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
d-
described
the
procedure,
and
now
you
tell
me
what,
in
your
opinion,
is
wrong
with
that
procedure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
opinion,
it
is
unreasonable
not
to
have
an
additional
step
that
the
prisoner
signs
for
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
i-
you
you
don't
mean
that
it
might
be
reasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
that's
why
i
don't
know
how
to
do
it
because,
i
mean,
suppose
there's
a
ship,
for
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
to
get
the
signature?
if
if,
for
example,
you're
you're
bringing
an
action
against
a
thing
and
the
thing
is
owned
by
millions,
thousands,
or
hundreds,
do
th-
does
the
ga-
do
do
you
have
to
normally,
under
the
rules
forget
the
constitution
for
the
moment
you
have
to
get
the
signature
on
a
on
th-
on
that
notice,
a
return
receipt
requested
of
each
person
who
has
an
interest
in
that
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
we
do
with
prisoners
who
won't
sign?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
just
put
the
burden
on
the
person
who
was
supposed
to
get
it
to
prove
he
didn't
get
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
y-
you
you
look,
th-
what
what
i
take
it
that
she's
arguing
for
is
there's
a
step
missing
here
and
it
could
a-
should
apply
not
just
to
prisoners,
apply
to
anybody
who's
going
to
have
their
property
forfeited,
and
that
is,
you
give
them
notice
by
certified
mail
so
they
have
to
sign
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
basically,
we-
as
i
understand
it,
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is,
what
is
if
you're
in
the
government,
aside
from
well,
it's
a
little
easier.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
reason
that
that's
wrong
is
because?
i
mean,
th-
the
harm
that
it
will
do
it
other
analogous
situations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
since
you're
writing
the
address
anyway
i
want
an
example
of
the
problem
that
would
be
caused
by
saying
you
not
only
have
to
write
the
address,
you
also
have
to
send
it
certified,
whether
it's
to
dormitories,
armed
forces,
prisoners,
or
anyone
else
in
the
world.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
court
action
th-
y-
if-
if
you
accepted
your
your
points
and
said,
look,
they
send
it
to
the
prison.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
type
action.
