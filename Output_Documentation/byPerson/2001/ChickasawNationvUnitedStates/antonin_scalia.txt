justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
not
a
new
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
say
that
the
way
to
read
it
is,
concerning
the
re-
t-
the
way
it
reads,
if
one
would
read
it
normally,
is,
concerning
the
reporting
and
withholding
of
taxes
with
respect
to
the
winnings
from
gaming
or
wagering
operations.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wish
you
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
wouldn't
that
have
been
covered
just
as
easily
by
simply
saying
concerning
wagering
operations?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
that's
the
chapter
we're
okay,
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
the
only
reason
it
makes
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
before
you
get
to
that,
i
can
take
a
break
when
you
get
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
to,
,
you
know,
to
gamble
with
the
with
the
public
funds?
y-
see
what
i'm
saying?
at
the
end
of
it,
state,
you
can't
possibly
read
it
as,
apply
to
state
gaming
on
the
one
hand
and
wagering
operations
on
the
other
because
states
don't
game.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
way
at
the
end
and
another
way
in
the
middle.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
had
your
finger
on
your
button
before
i
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah...
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask
you?
you
you
say
they're
just
making
the
indian
tribes
similar
to
the
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
so
the
plausibility
of
of
of
of
giving
a
an
exemption
from
tax
here
to
the
t-
t-
to
the
indian
casinos,
because
after
all
the
states
have
it,
is
really
not
all
that
plausible
because
i
i
don't
know
any
state
that
has
gone
into
the
casino
business,
nor
do
i
think
any
is
about
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
w-
j-
just
just
not
just
lotteries.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
chapter
thirty-five?
justice
antonin
scalia
problem
here?
aren't
we
talking
about
casinos
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
lotteries,
,
gee,
we
don't
have
a
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
that
what
they're
relying
on
in
this
case,
that
that
that
that
exemption
as
as
exempting
casinos?
justice
antonin
scalia
pull-tab?
i've
never
pulled
a...
justice
antonin
scalia
what
a...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
depart
from
that
subject,
i
i
assume
that
there
there
there
would
be
a
a
a
mo-
a
motive
for
for
the
states
to
want
to
have
these
taxes
imposed
on
the
indian
lotteries
even
though
they
are
not
imposed
on
the
state
lotteries.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
odds
are...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
we
get
off
of
canons,
i
w-
we've
just
been
talking
about
two,
but
there's
a
third
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
indians'
proposed
interpretation
here
is
strained,
but
you
can
do
it
where
whereas
there
is
no
possible
way
to
read
section
thirty-five
on
your
interpretation
as
being
relevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
petition.
