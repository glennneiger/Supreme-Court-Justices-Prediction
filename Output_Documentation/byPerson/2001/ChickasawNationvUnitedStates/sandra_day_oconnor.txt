i
guess
you're
calling
it
wagering
operations,
not
wagering.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
they
impose
an
excise
tax
on
operators?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
gaming
and
wagering?
if
you
if
you
have
a
casino,
you
have
to
pay
an
excise...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you're
arguing
that
the
t-
indian
tribes
that
operate
the
casinos
were
given
somehow
the
same
exemption
from
that
that
states
are
when
states
operate
lotteries
or
some
kind
of
gambling
operation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
two
different
kinds
of
presumptions
that
we
face
w-
with
language
that
can
be
said
to
be
ambiguous.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
reference
to
indian
wagering
operations
i-
i-
in
chapter
thirty-five?
just
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
makes
no
reference...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
in
any
event,
we're
not
talking
here
about
indian
casinos,
gambling
casino
operations,
because
they
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
exemption
in
title
thirty-five
even
if
it
applied.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
the
reference
to
section
sixty
fifty
i?
do
you
have
an
explanation
for
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
surprising
in
the
broad
sense
that
congress
clearly
has
favored
indian
gaming
operations
and
has
wanted
to
provide
income
to
the
tribes
for
their
purposes
through
those
operations,
and
to
impose
an
excise
tax
on
it
when
the
congress
doesn't
impose
it
on
the
states
would
be
perfectly
consistent
with
that
overall
objective,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
consistent
because
the
effort
over
there
in
congress
has
been
to
support
these
indian
gaming
operations,
not
that
i
necessarily
think
it's
a
good
idea,
but
congress
obviously
does.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
what?
