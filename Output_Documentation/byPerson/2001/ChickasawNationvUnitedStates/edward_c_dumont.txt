mr.
edward
c.
dumont
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i'm
always
excited
to
appear
before
you,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
and
it
does
not,
i
should
point
out,
exempt
states
from
all
taxes.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
actually
that
the
exemption
is
more
limited
than
that.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it's
page
ninety-two
a
of
the
petition
appendix,
reprints
section
forty-four
oh
two
which
ec-
lists
the
exemptions.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
the
exemption,
although
the
the
gambling
at
issue
here
is
so-called
pull-tabs
which
are
a
form
of
lottery,
not
a
form
of
table
gaming.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
pull-tab
is
a
little
card
about
like
this
with
three
to
five
little
windows,
like
an
advent
calendar,
that
you
can
pull
up
and
reveal
something
underneath
them.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
and
if
you
find
under
it
three
angels,
for
instance,
you
may
you
may
win
something.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
true.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
have
an
indian
lottery.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
the
tax.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
talking
about.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
that's
certainly
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
be
a
foregone
conclusion
to
many
tribal
lawyer-
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
do
not
have
a
good
explanation
for
that.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it's
a
lot
more
understandable
for
the
following
reason.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
a
lot
of
people
both
at
the
irs
and
on
the
hill
whose
job
it
is
to
comb
through
tax
legislation.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i'm
not
aware
that
anyone
has
brought
this
issue
to,
onto
the
legislative
agenda.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
it
would
have
been
perfectly
consistent
to
grant
the
exemption.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
but
recall,
justice
o'connor,
that
in
the
specific
context
of
the
indian
gaming
regulatory
act,
w-
what
was
going
on
was
not
a
unilateral
project
in
favor
of
tribal
interests.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
your
competitive
analogy
exac-
is
exactly
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it's
a
very
small
tax,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
if
it
were
a...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
because
of
the
historical
difference
in
the
relations
between
the
federal
government
and
the
tribes
on
the
one
hand
and
the
state
governments
and
the
tribes
on
the
other
hand,
and
the
best
case
i
can
point
you
to
on
that
is
the
kagama
case
from
the
end
of
the
last
century
which
talks
about
the
trust
relationship
and
it
talks
about
the
fact
that
the
tribes
stand
in
a
very
different
relation
to
the
federal
government
from
the
relation
in
which
they
stand
to
the...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
there
are...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
there
are
two
things
i'd
like
to
point
out
about
that.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i'm
not
sure
it
tells
you
very
much
at
all
about
meaning.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that
the
trust
relationship
exists
in
the
first
place...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
don't
suggest
that
in
in
cases
involving
federal
taxation
because
there
is
an
an
equally
strong
and
and,
in
this
particular
context,
opposite
principle
that
exemptions
from
the
exactions,
the
general
exactions,
to
support
the
federal
government
are
to
be
narrowly
construed.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
they're
not
to
be
emp-
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
not
in
the
same
not
in
the
same
way.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
but
page
ninety
a.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
don't
think
it's
just
a
strained
reading,
i
think
it's
an
impossible
reading...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
or
the
ta-
or
the
wagering
tax?
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the
wagering
tax
i-
the
definitions
the
n-
the
definitions
on
page
ninety-seven
a
exempt
from,
they
define
define
a
l-
a
wager
as
sports
wagering
or
forty-four
twenty-one
one
c,
any
wager
placed
in
a
lottery
conducted
for
profit.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
excludes
those.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
of
the
main
gray
brief,
the
gray
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
suspect
it
would
have
had
to
go
through
the
tax
writing...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
yes.
