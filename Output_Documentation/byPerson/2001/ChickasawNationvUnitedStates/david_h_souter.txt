the
oddity
of
the
argument
to
me
is
that
the,
you're
assum-
i
think
your
explanation
is
assuming
that
the
basic
activity
that's
going
on
in
a
casino,
which
is
giving
rise
to
each
of
these
different
kinds
of
liability,
is
the
same
activity.
justice
david
h.

the
operation,
th-
the
wagering
operation
for
one
purpose
is
gaming
for
another
purpose,
and
that,
and
in
your,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
and
that's
just
a
very
strange
and
confusing
usage
to
impute
to
the
congress.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
reporting
and
withholding,
and
the
activity
of
the
reporting
and
withholding
is
not
gaming,
but
wagering
operation.

well,
when
you
say
gaming
at
the
middle,
don't
you...

by
a
player
in
a
casino?
justice
david
h.

okay,
and
isn't
that
what
you
would
also
mean
when
the
word
gaming
is
used
at
the
end?
justice
david
h.
souter
buy
your
argument,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
see
the
inconsistency.
justice
david
h.

thank
you.

theology,
it's
not
weird
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
not,
h-
i
mean,
it
you're
you're
saying
that
part
of
the
compromise
might
be
that
the
states
end
up
without
taxation
and
the
indians
get
taxed.
justice

something
else?
may
may
i...
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
now
ask
you
to
turn
to
to
something
else?
i
i
asked
counsel
on
the
other
side
about
the
significance
of
your
argument
that
the
presumption
favoring
the
the
tribes
in
this
situation
should
not
operate,
even
though
it
might
in
a
case
of
state
taxation,
because
of
the
government's
plenary
power
over
indians
as
as
distinct
from
the
states'
right
only
by
sufferance
of
the
federal
government
to
tax.
justice
david
h.

that
that
certainly
affects,
we'll
assume
the
obligation
of
the
government,
and
it
certainly
may
well
accept
the
m-
the
specific
decisions
that
the
government
makes.

counterintuitive,

guess.

tell
us
that
in-
informs
us
in
in
construction?
it
it
tells
us
something
about
the
government's
obligations
to
various
groups
of
people,
but
i
don't
know
what
it
tells
us
about
about
meaning.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
assuming
you
got
two
tie-breakers
and
they're
at
odds.
justice
david
h.
souter
they're
a-
they're
at
they're
n-
they're
not
or
the
the
the
the
apparent
loggerhead
should
should
dissolve
when
you
realize
that
the
government
has
a
particular
trust
relationship
to
indians.
