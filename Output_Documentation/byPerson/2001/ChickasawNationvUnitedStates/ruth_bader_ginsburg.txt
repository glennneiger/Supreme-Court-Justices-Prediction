before
you
proceed
further
with
this
argument
that
you
make
in
your
reply
brief,
did
you
present
it,
this
or
distinguishing
gaming
on
the
one
hand
from
wagering
operations?
did
you
present
that
to
the
tenth
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
did
you
present
it
in
your
opening
brief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
make
this
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you've
answered
the
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
winnings
from
wagering.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
from
wagering.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
gaming,
a
gaming
operations
or
wagering
operations,
perhaps
you
can
clarify
what
is
the
difference
between
gaming
as
a
noun
and
wagering
operations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
the
winnings
by
players
from
wagering.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
difference
between
those
two?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
tell
me
concretely
what
is
the
difference
between
winnings
from
gaming
and
winnings
from
wagering
operations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
a-
ask
you
one
question
on
on
the
text
that
supports
justice
breyer's
notion
that
maybe
this
was
just
a
crazy
drafter?
the
sta-
section
starts
out,
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
nineteen
eighty-six.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
sentence
then
to
start
sections
so
and
so
and
so
and
so
concerning?
why
have
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
that
you
you
subscribe
to
the
position
that
judge
dyke
took
in
the
federal
circuit
because
he
said
there
wasn't
a
good
explanation
for
it
either.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
after
the
split,
though,
between
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
federal
circuit,
did
anyone
call
the
responsible
committee's
attention
to
this
so
that
congress
could
fix
up
the
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
do
concede
that,
a-
as
i
believe
judge
dyke
said,
the
only
way
you
can
make
sense
out
of
the
statute
is
to
treat
it
as
though
the
reference
to
chapter
thirty-five
were
not
there.
