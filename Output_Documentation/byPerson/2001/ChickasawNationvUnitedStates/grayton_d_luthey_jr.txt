mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
chickasaw
and
choctaw
nations
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
congress
has
afforded
tribes
the
same
exemption
from
federal
wagering
taxes
enjoyed
by
state
governmental
wagering
operations.
we
do
not
base
our
claim
on
policy
untethered
to
statutory
text,
but
instead
we
bla-
base
our
claim
today
on
section
twenty
d
of
the
indian
gaming
regulatory
act
codified
at
twenty-five
usc,
section
twenty-seven
nineteen
d.
unfortunately,
for
all
concerned,
that
statutory
text
is
ambiguous,
as
every
appellate
judge
which
has
examined
it
has
held
either
expressly
or
implicitly,
and
as
we
expect
the
government
to
admit
today
if
the
question
is
put
to
them.
one
of
the
possible
constructions
of
that
ambiguous
statute,
based
on
its
text
and
structure
and
giving
effect
to
every
word
of
the
statute
and
bolstered
by
its
legislative
history,
is
that
the
tax
exemption
afforded
states
by
internal
revenue
code
chapter
thirty-five,
expressly
referenced
in
section
twenty-seven
nineteen
d,
applies
equally
to
tribal
wagering
operations.
[inaudible]
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
i
would
direct
your
honor
to
the
petitioner's
appendix
ninety
a,
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
to
our
appendix
for
certiorari.
well,
haven't
you
set
it
out
on...
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
now
starting
with
the
actual
text
of
the
statute,
we
believe
that
the
statute
contains
two
central
textual
commands,
one
that
has
to
do
with
the
reporting
and
withholding
of
taxes
from
gaming,
from
wei-
from
the
winnings
from
gaming,
and
also
the
application
of
the
internal
revenue
code
provisions
concerning
wagering
operations.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
not
directly
like
that,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
what
we
did,
your
honor,
in
the
opening
brief
is
adopt
the
decision
by
the
majority
in
the
little
six
decision
from
the...
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
no.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
to
address
specifically,
your
honor,
the
government's
position
which
we
claim
is
based
on
a
false
premise.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
the
way
we
would
have
the
provision
read,
your
honor,
is
set
out
at
page
nine.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
page
nine
of
the
reply
brief
where
we
suggest
that
concerning
addresses
two
distinct
central
textual
commands...
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
in
contradiction,
your
honor,
to
the
government's
assertion
that
there
is
one
central...
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
your
honor,
if
i
could...
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
i
th-
i
think
our
reading
is
informed
by
the
parenthetical
reference
that
precedes
these
two
concepts,
and
particularly
the
text
and
structure
of
that
parenthetical
reference.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
from
gaming.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
yeah,
it's
from
gaming
by
players,
your
honor.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
i-
it's
our,
a-
and
you
hit
hit
right
exactly
on
the
point,
your
honor.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
no.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
i-
the
the
difference
is
how
it
is
used
in
the
context
of
this
statute.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
winnings
from
gaming
here
is
refers
to
winnings
by
the
players
from
gaming,
money
paid
to
players
as
a
result
of
gaming,
winnings
from
what...
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
th-
they
they
could
be
regarded
synonymous
if
both
are
used
as
nouns,
mr.
chief
justice,
or
both
are
used
as
adjectives.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
what
function
a
plays
is
that
the
tax
is
imposed
on
the
winnings
from
gaming
as
a
result
of
what
the
players
have
won.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
not
necessarily...
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
because
when
you
get
to
the
second
set,
your
honor,
particularly
sixty
fifty
i
and
chapter
thirty-five,
the
text
of
those
provisions
have
nothing
to
do
with
winnings.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
well...
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
well,
section
fourteen
forty-one
and
thirty-four
oh
two
actually
do
impose
a
tax,
a
percentage
of
tax,
that
is
on
the
winnings
from
gaming.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
i-
is
different,
your
honor.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
a
cha-
a
tax
on
the
operator
based
on
the
wagers
that
have
been
received,
not
the
money
that
the
operator
has
paid
out.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
i-
if
you
would...
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
wi-
with
respect,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
wagering
and
gaming
as
nouns,
they
could
be
read
to
refer
to
the
same
thing.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
to
do
with
it.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
[inaudible]
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
that's
that's
exactly
correct,
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
w
wi-
with
respect,
your
honor,
if
i-
if
the
statute
is
read
closely,
the
first
three
provisions
of
the
parenthetical
apply
to
concerning
the
reporting
and
withholding
of
taxes
with
respect
to
the
winnings.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
then
we
have
two
additional
provisions
identified,
sixty
fifty
i
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
chapter
thirty-five...
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
i
i
i
i'm
i'm
not
being
clear
here.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
nothing
to
do
with
reporting
and
withholding.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
they
do.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
other
type
of
wagering
operation,
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
a-
at
the
end
of,
at
the
end
of
the...
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
well,
th-
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
i'd
l-
i'd
like,
your
honor,
to
offer
a
third
explanation
in
response
to
your
direct
question.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
that
congress
ended.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
you
will
find
that
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
little
six
at
page
twenty-five.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
in
mescalero,
your
honor,
there
were
actually
two
particular
taxes
at
issue.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
the
underlying
trust
relationship,
your
honor,
between
the
united
states
and
the
indians,
its
wards,
as
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
county
of
oneida...
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
because
the
statute
is
imposed
by
congress
on
its
wards,
and
this
court
has
long
recognized,
including
in
the
montana
versus
blackfeet
tribe,
that
statutes
concerning
indians
that
have
ambiguity
are
to
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
indians.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
direct
your
honor
to
squire
versus
capoeman
at
three
fifty-one
us
one
where
this
court
dealt
with
a
federal
tax,
a
claimed
exemption
from
federal
taxation,
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
and
applied
the
indian
canon
in
favor
of
the
tax
exemption
sought
by
the
indians.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
at
this
time,
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
i
i
must
disagree
with
you.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
i
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
nineteen
eighty-six
are
then
explained
after
the
parenthetical
by
specifically
what
the
provisions
concern
that
are
to
be
applied
in
the
same
way
as
states,
and
specifically
included
in
that
is
chapter
thirty-five
which
contains
the
exemption
for
states.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
i-
the
the
the
lead-in,
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
is
limited
by
its
by
the
part
of
the
statute
that
identifies
what
the
internal
revenue
concerns
that
shall
be
applicable
equally
for
state
gaming,
as
well
as
for
the
tribal
activity
here.
mr.
grayton
d.
luthey,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
