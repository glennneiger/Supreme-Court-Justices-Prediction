if
you're
going
to
go
to
legislative
history,
why
doesn't
it
all
become
clear?
originally
there
was
a
bill
that
had
the
word
not
only
the
reporting
but
also
taxations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
explanation,
but
the
third
explanation
then
depends
on
the
testimony
of
the
indian
tribal
interests
that
say
they
don't
want
the
word
taxation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
are
y-
are
we
talking
about,
is
is
the
excise
tax
of,
point
two
five
percent
on
the
amount
of
each
wager
in
forty-four
oh
one
a
one
does
that
apply
to
indian
gaming?
it
says,
there
shall
be
imposed
on
any
wager
authorized
under
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
accepted
an
a-
an
excise
tax
equal
to
zero
point
two
five
percent
of
the
amount
of
such
wager.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
tax
we're...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
that's
what
i
what
i'm
thinking
of,
is
is
the,
what
i'm
thinking
about
is
since
forty-four
a
forty-four
oh
one
a
one,
i
e
there
shall
be
a
quarter
of
one
percent
tax
on
every
wager
authorized
under
the
law
of
the
state,
except
later
on,
a,
b,
c,
d.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
someone
over
in
the
irs
whose
job
it
is
to
look
through
bills,
when
they
finally
emerge,
and
check
the
cross
references
and
the
numbers
who
might
have
caught
what
seems
to
be,
in
your
argument
certainly,
an
accidental
error
in
not
taking
a
number
out
that
should
have
been
taken
out?
is
there
anyone
there
whose
job
it
is
to
do
that?
i
would
think
there
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
an
act
called
the
indian
gaming
regulatory
act
that
provides
that
certain
internal
revenue
code
provisions
will
apply
to
indian
tribes
the
same
way
that
they
apply
the
states,
which
ones.
but
what
the
act
says
is
“provisions...
concerning
the
reporting
and
withholding
of
gambling
taxes.”
those
are
the
provisions,
but
as
you
noticed
i
said,
“...”.
now,
what
is
in
those
...
is
a
parenthetical.
so,
what
it
actually
says
is
provisions
(including
sections
1441,
3402(q),
6041,
and
6050i
and
chapter
35
of
such
code,
i.e.,
chapter
35
of
the
internal
revenue
code).
now
the
problem
in
the
case
comes
up
because
chapter
35
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
reporting
and
the
withholding
of
gambling
taxes.
it
is
the
provision
that
asserts,
that
lays
down,
and
that
imposes
the
tax.
well,
the
tribes
argue
that
we
have
to
give
some
meaning
to
the
word
"chapter
35",
and
the
only
possible
meaning
it
could
have
is
that
it
should
apply
to
them
as
it
applies
to
states.
it
happens
to
make
exceptions
for
the
states
from
the
tax
and
therefore
the
tribe
shouldn't
have
to
pay
tax
either.
now,
at
the
very
least,
they
say,
the
statute
is
ambiguous
in
that
respect
and
that
being
so,
remember,
the
canon,
statutes
are
to
be
construed
liberally
in
favor
of
the
indians
which
has
appeared
in
several
of
our
cases.
now,
it
is
a
very
good
argument
but
we
conclude
that
we
cannot
agree
with
that
argument.
in
our
view,
the
statute
is
about
what
it
says
it
is
about,
namely
the
reporting
and
withholding
of
taxes.
it
is
not
about
imposing
taxes.
we
think
it
means
that
the
indian
tribes
like
the
states
are
free
from
certain
reporting
and
withholding
requirements.
we
do
not
think
it
means
that
the
indian
tribes
don't
have
to
pay
the
taxes.
and
as
far
as
the
reference
to
chapter
35,
we
think
basically,
it
was
a
cross
referencing
error,
a
numerical
error,
remaining
in
the
statute
and
that
conclusion
draws
some
support
from
the
fact
that
at
one
stage,
the
bill
that
became
the
law
referred
not
just
to
reporting
and
withholding
but
it
also
referred
to
“taxation”.
in
which
case,
a
cross
reference
to
chapter
35
would
have,
at
that
time,
made
a
lot
of
sense
but
the
committee
took
the
word
taxation
out
of
the
bill.
we
cannot
say
the
statute
is
really
ambiguous
at
least
it
cannot
be
understood
in
two
or
more
possible
senses.
considering
ordinary
life,
somebody
is
saying
to
you,
“test
drive
some
cars
including
plymouth,
nissan,
chevrolet,
ford,
and
kitchenaid.”
well,
i
do
not
think
we
would
say
that
was
ambiguous;
i
think
we
would
say
whoever
was
saying
it
just
made
a
mistake,
they
don't
understand
what
kitchenaid
is,
and
that
is
basically
how
we
conclude
the
provision
in
front
of
us
should
be
interpreted.
nor
can
we
really
make
the
indian
canon
determinative
because
there
are
many
canons
here
and
they
cut
in
different
directions,
for
example,
there
is
a
canon
that
says,
"exemptions
from
taxation
must
be
clearly
expressed".
for
these
and
other
reasons
discussed
in
our
opinion,
we
reject
the
tribe’s
claim
for
tax
exemption.
we
affirm
the
similar
determination
made
by
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
