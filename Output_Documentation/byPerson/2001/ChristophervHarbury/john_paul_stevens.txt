justice
john
paul
stevens
could
be
a
lie.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
see
how
no
comment
could
be
a
lie.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
position,
just
to
be
sure,
that
the
refusal
to
give
information
can
never
be
a
denial
of
access
to
the
courts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
e-
e-
i-
at
bottom,
in
this
case
you're
claiming
damages
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i-
but
what's
running
through
my
mind
is
the
there's
a
a
long
chain
of
causation
here,
and
if
if
one
were
persuaded
and
i'm
not
saying
i
am,
but
w-
if
one
were
persuaded
that
even
if
you
had
all
the
help
that
you
sought
at
the
time
you
did,
there
still
would
not
have
been
time
to
save
your
husband's
life.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
your
answer
raises
this
question
in
my
mind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
first
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
people?
you-
u-
shield
the
members
of
the
cia
or
the
people
who
are
doing
the
the
interrogating?
