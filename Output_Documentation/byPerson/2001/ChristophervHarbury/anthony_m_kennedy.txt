justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
t-
to
begin
with
right
of
access,
y-
the
bell
case,
bell
versus
milwaukee,
is
discussed
in
in
the
in
the
briefs.
that's
nineteen
eighty-three.
this
is
bivens.
i
recognize
the
distinction.
that's,
of
course,
a
circuit
court
case.
it's
not
but
suppose
that
case
were
here.
suppose
we
had
the
bell
case.
would
you
say
the
bell
case
is
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
there's
a
police
coverup
and
the
police
destroy
the
evidence
and
they
lie,
e-
et
cetera,
no
n-
no
cause
of
action
for
denial
of
access
to
courts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
government
imprisons
the
key
witness
in
my
suit
in
order
to
deprive
me
of
the
ability
to
w-
win
the
suit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
do,
mr.
olson,
with
the
s-
circuit
court
cases
which
have
held
under
nineteen
eighty-three
a
violation
of
the
r-
right
of
access
to
courts
when
there's
a
coverup
of
a
of
of
a
police
murderer
or
s-
s-
something
of
that
sort?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
this
were
a
a
private
cause
of
of
of
action
without
governmental
actors,
it
would
be
just
a
tort
of
deceit,
i
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
deceit
if
these
were
all
private
actors.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
you
that
the
only
reason
you
you
can
s-
must
say
that
is
because
if
you
followed
the
usual
course
of
the
law
and
filed
an
action
for
deceit,
you'd
be
barred
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
in
in
the
context
of
a
private
person,
under
the
law
of
torts,
there
is
an
action
for
deceit
based
on
the
f-
facts
that
you've
that
you've
discussed,
is
there
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
y-
you
began
by
telling
us
that
this
is
a
very
narrow
remedy
that
you
seek.
