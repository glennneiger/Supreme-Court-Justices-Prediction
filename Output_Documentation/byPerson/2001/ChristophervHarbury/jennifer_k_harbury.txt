ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
turns
upon
a
very
narrow
question
of
law,
specifically:
may
united
states
officials
take
affirmative
and
wrongful
action
to
deceive
a
citizen,
number
one,
with
the
intention
of
obstructing
her
or
preventing
her
from
proceeding
to
the
courts
of
law
for
emergency
injunctive
relief,
and
where
such
affirmative
and
wrongful
conduct
and
actions
of
deceit
not
only
delay
the
filing
of
that
case,
but
in
fact
extinguish
the
cause
of
action,
and
when
it
is
known
at
the
time
that
her
husband
is
in
a
secret
cell
being
severely
tortured
and
that
he
is
in
danger
of
imminent
extrajudicial
execution.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
no,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
i
believe
the
federal
tort
claims
act
could
not
have
been
triggered
in
the
case
when
one
was
only
asking
for
injunctive
relief,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
yes,
there
is.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
i
could
not
sue
d-
for
deceit
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
all
of
the
claims
that
i
would
have
stated,
your
honor,
would
have
been
rooted
in
the
concept
that
in
the
absence
of
extraordinary
circumstances,
as
in
guatemala
in
nineteen
ninety-two
and
ninety-three,
the
use
of
torture,
the
causation
and
participation
in
torture
by
united
states
officials,
was
completely
outside
of
the
scope
of
their
delegated
authorities
and,
in
the
alternative,
in
violation
of
their
own
regulations
and
subject
to
review
under
the
apa
for
inj-
emergency
injunctive
relief.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
there
are
some
tort
claims
issues
still
in
the
district
court,
yes,
your
honor,
but
those
cannot
make
good
the
lost
day
in
court
to
save
a
human
life.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
if
the
question
were
there
was
no
time...
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
i
would
certainly
want
to
bring
my
witnesses
and
my
evidence
to
a
factual
hearing
on
exactly
that
subject,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
there
was
at
least
six
months
if
not,
under
more
recent
information,
a
year
or
a
year-and-a-half
during
which
i
could
have
saved
my
husband's
life.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
i
am,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
in
this
case
it
would
be
a
common
law
situ-
common
law
tort,
your
honor,
to
commit
intentional
deceit
where
the
person
making
the
deceptive
statements
is
fully
aware
and
intends
that
a...
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
person
will
rely
on
that
statement
to
their
detriment.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
i'm
saying
that
where
the
common
law
tort
of
deceit
is
the
wrongful
act
which
was
taken
in
order
to
block
access
to
the
courts
of
law,
then
it
becomes
a
constitutional
tort.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
i
made
the
foia
request
in
january
of
ninety-five.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
under
those
conditions,
your
honor,
knowing
or
believing
that
my
husband
could
still
well
be
alive
and
su-
being
subjected
to
torture,
i
would
have
been
in
court
immediately
for
a
tro
for
expedited
handling
of
that
case.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
your
honor,
i
believe
the
foia
itself
makes
provisions
for
expedited
handling
where
necessary,
and
i
believe
that
any
federal
district
court,
using
their
rights
and
their
equitable
remedies
for
emergency
situations,
could
have
ordered
the
emergency
processing.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
if
i
may.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
i'm
not
sure
if
i'm
understanding
your...
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
we're
there
are,
of
course
there
is,
of
course,
here
a
case
within
a
case.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
i
would
have
asked
in
nineteen
ninety-three
for
three
steps
to
have
been
taken
by
the
cia
through
through
an
injunctive
through
an
injunction
by
the
courts.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
the
first
point
of
the
injunction
would
have
been
to
prohibit
cia
officials
from
requesting
and
promising
payment
for
and
making
payment
for
continued
information
contemporaneously
being
extracted
through
the
use
of
torture
from
a
living
prisoner.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
point
two
would
have
been
these
are
your
employees.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
the
cia
was
not
properly
reporting
my
husband's
situation
to
congress
at
the
time,
and
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
repeatedly
writing
to
congress
saying
there
is
no
information
about
mr.
bamaca
at
all.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
questions
that
i
would
leave
to
congress
and
that
are
not
raised
in
this
case
would
be
may
c
may
a
cia
agent
purchase
information
from
someone
known
to
be
an
unsavory
character.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
that
carrying
out
torture
was
outside
the
scope
of
any
statutory
delegation
of
power
to
the
cia...
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
violation
of
its
own
internal
policies
and
regulations.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
violation
of
any
any
internal
regulations
they
might
have
for
extraordinary...
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
leaving
that
issue
aside,
it
certainly
violated
any
authority
ever
delegated
by
congress
to
any
person,
any
official
in
this
country
to
engage
in
torture.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
if
the
petitioners
wished
to
present
to
the
district
court
an
affirmative
defense
in
the
answer,
which
has,
of
course,
not
yet
been
filed
we're
still
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage
stating
that
somehow
there
were
overriding
national
security
interests
which
forced
them
or
justified
their
actions
in
this
case,
that
that
met
the
strict
scrutiny
test
of
a
fundamental
right
such
as
access
to
the
courts,
if
they
wish
to
make
that
statement
and
try
to
provide
that
evidence,
then
i
would
wish
to
come
to
the
courts
of
law
and
provide
my
evidence
of
pretext
that
that
those
extraordinary
circumstances
of
national
security
did
not
at
all
exist
in
guatemala
during
this
relevant
time
period.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
i'm
saying
i'm
trying
to
conjecture
what
the
petitioners
might
raise
because
they
haven't
raised
it
yet.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
i
believe
in
that
case
the
question
was
the
denial
of
the
right
of
citizens
from
another
state,
in
ohio,
to
actually
file
suit,
and
similar
to
in
re
hull,
it
was
interpreted
as
barring
the
courthouse
door.
ms.
jennifer
k.
harbury
but
the
court,
in
discussing
those
issues,
noted
the
fundamental
importance
of
the
access
to
courts
and
the
equal
access
to
courts
of
all
citizens.
