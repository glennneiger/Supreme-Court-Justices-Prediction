system,
and
they're
holding
the
cri-
a
group
of
rogue
policemen
are
unlawfully
holding
somebody
in
a
jail
cell
and
his
wife
comes
in
and
says,
i
i
want
to
get
a
go
to
court
and
get
a
writ
of
habeas

on
his
behalf.

well,
would
they?
that's
i
mean,
obviously
reading
your
story,
one
is
immediately
sympathetic,
and
it's
a
very
sad
and
difficult.

trying
to
work
getting
you
to
address
what
i
would
see
as
a
major
implication,
which
is
not
at
all
casting
doubt
on
on
the
sympathy
with
which
an
individual
might
have,
but
rather
the
problem
of
conducting
foreign
affairs,
which
we're
told
by
the
government
requires
courts
to
stay
out
of
certain
things
and
your
thing
is
in
that
category
that
they
say
stay
out
of.
justice
stephen

breyer
thinking
of
the
case
within
the
case...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
to
have
had
a
claim
that
a
judge
would
have
gone
and
addressed,
otherwise
the
blocking
you
from
that
wouldn't
have
mattered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
clearly
true.
