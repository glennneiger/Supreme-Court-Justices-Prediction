mr.
richard
a.
cordray
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
current
and
former
government
officials
who
have
been
sued
in
their
individual
capacity
based
on
a
claim
for
denial
of
access
to
the
courts
and
the
further
claim
that
they
violated
clearly
established
law
as
of
nineteen
ninety-three,
thus
negating
their
defense
of
qualified
immunity.
the
substantive
due
process
right
of
access
claim
urged
here
is
extremely
expansive
and
unsupported
by
the
court's
precedents.
our
position
boils
down
to
this.
the
right
of
access
is
not
violated
unless
an
individual
is,
in
fact,
barred
from
filing
claims
in
the
courts.
in
limited
circumstances,
far
different
from
those
at
issue
here,
the
court
has
recognized
that
an
actual
bar
to
access
in
the
courts
implicates
the
due
process
clause.
here
there
is
no
denial
of
access
to
the
courts
under
this
court's
precedents.
the
claim
asserted
here,
moreover,
would
constitutionalize
the
handling
of
informal
channels
of
communication
between
government
officials
and
private
citizens.
it's
entirely
foreseeable
that
recognizing
this
claim
would
cause
the
flow
of
information
to
the
public
to
be
reduced
to
stultifying
forms
of
pretrial
discovery.
we
know
of
no
holding
of
this
court
that
would
lead
to
such
a
result.
[inaudible]
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
your
honor,
we
feel
that
the
conduct
at
issue
in
the
bell
case,
very
serious
misconduct
there
were
actual
criminal
violations.
the
perpetrators
were
prosecuted.
there
would
be
many
ways
to
address
the
misconduct
at
issue
in
that
case.
we
do
not
believe
that
it
would
state
a
claim
for
denial
of
access
to
the
courts.
we
also
believe
an-
and
in
fact,
it's
the
district
court
held
here
the
facts
of
that
case
are
quite
distant
from
this
case
where
here
we're
in
the
sensitive
context
of
foreign
policy
and
the
oversight
of
covert
militar-
o-
operations
in
a
foreign
country,
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
and
that
would
result...
but
your
basic
position
is...
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
we
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
for
this
reason.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i-
alleged
that
that
is
the
sole
motive,
no
other
motive.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
in
a
situation
where
the
government
was
holding
an
individual
in
custody,
therefore
physically
barring
that
person
from
accessing
the
courts,
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that...
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that
person
would
have
a
claim
for
denial
of
access
to
the
courts.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
are
we
talking
about
a
criminal
case,
a
criminal
proceeding?
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
it
would
matter
if
it
were
a
criminal
proceeding
because
there
are
special
fair
trial
guarantees
that
the
constitution
imposes
such
as
brady
versus
maryland
and
the
like
in
a
an
ongoing
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
at
any
time.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
mhm...
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that
that's
true,
nor
do
we
contend
otherwise.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
i
i
don't
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
a
constitutional
line
can't
be
founded
there.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
sure.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
w-
we
don't
think
a
constitutional
line
could
be
could
be
founded
there
and
maintained.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
a
delay
in
what
constitute
harm?
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
whu-
again,
i
don't
think
that
that
founds
that
that
meets
the
standing
requirements.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
it
it
may
have
been
delayed.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
the
united
states
has
substituted
itself
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
the
purposes
of
those
claims.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yes,
they
are.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
i'm
not
certain,
to
be
honest,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
because
there
would
be,
again,
a
a
traceability,
redressability
problem.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
it
it
would
be
close
to
the
line.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
i
frankly
think
it's
like
the
simon
case
where
the
issue
was
availability
of
tax
credit
or
tax
relief,
and
it
was
thought
that
tha
was
not
significant
enough
to
inf-
in-
influence
clearly
the
third...
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
well,
we
think
we
think
both.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
it
would
be
close
to
the
line
because
we're
talking
about
independent
decisions
by
third
parties
in
response
to
a
court
order
would
be
the
issue.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
but
the
only
claim
to
standing
on
her
part
to
enjoin
the
cia
from
doing
something
would
be
somehow
because
it
affects
her
husband's
well-being
and
the
like.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
further
step
that
the
third
parties
are
going
to
be
influenced
in
a
positive
way
and
a
decisive
way
by
an
american
court
order,
and
that's
where
we
think
it
breaks
down.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
we
think
that
there's
not
standing
under
simon
and
linda
r.s.,
and
we
think
it's
even
clearer
in
a
foreign
military
context
where
we're
talking
about
foreign
nationals
not
subject
to
u.s.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
sure.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
here
for
denial
of...
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
for
denial
of
access
to
the
courts?
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
by
ms.
harbury
for
denial
of
access
to
the
courts.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
it's
distant
from
any
allegations
of
torture
or
mistreatment
of
someone.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
we
still
allege
there
there
are
many
steps
on
the
standing
argument
in
terms
of
what
kind
of
claims
she
would
have
brought.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
again,
in
a
situation
where
the
claim
is
that
she
did
not
have
timely
disclosure
of
information
that
would
have
helped
her
formulate
her
cause
of
action,
we
do
not
think
that
falls
within
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
we
don't
concede
that.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
thank
you,
your
honor.
