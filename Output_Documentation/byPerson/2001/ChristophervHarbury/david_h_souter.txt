01-394,
christopher
v.
harbury.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
jennifer
harbury,
a
united
states
citizen
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
alleging
among
other
things.
the
officials
of
the
state
department
of
the
national
security
council
had
intentionally
deceived
her
in
concealing
information
about
her
husband
a
guatemalan
decedent.
she
alleged
that
these
officials
knew
that
her
husband
had
been
captured,
tortured
and
then
killed
by
guatemalan
army
officers
who
were
paid
agents
of
the
central
intelligence
agency.
in
addition
to
claims
of
direct
harm
to
her
and
her
husband
on
behalf
of
his
estate,
harbury
claimed
that
she
had
been
unconstitutionally
denied
access
to
the
courts,
when
state
department
officials
affirmatively
deceived
her
while
her
husband
was
still
alive.
she
alleged
that
this
deception
prevented
her
from
bringing
a
suit
that
might
have
saved
her
husband’s
life.
she
sued
the
officials
on
the
theory
of
bivens
against
six
unknown
federal
narcotics
agents
for
this
denial
of
judicial
access.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
access
to
court’s
claim
and
other
claims
brought
under
bivens
for
failure
to
state
a
claim,
but
it
did
not
dismiss
certain
common
law
tort
claims
that
she
brought
invoking
the
federal
tort
claims
act
including
a
claim
for
intentional-infliction
of
emotional
distress
against
the
cia
defendants
for
the
torture
and
death
of
her
husband.
the
dc
circuit
generally
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
the
claims,
but
it
reversed
the
district
court’s
dismissal
of
the
access
to
court’s
claims
brought
against
the
government
officials
involved,
and
it
also
affirmed
that
they
were
non-entitled
to
qualified
immunity
for
their
deceptive
statements
denying
harbury
judicial
access.
we
granted
certiorari
as
to
the
circuit
court’s
holding
on
the
access
to
court’s
claim
because
of
the
importance
of
the
issue
to
the
conduct
of
the
nation’s
foreign
affairs.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse
and
remand.
as
a
general
matter,
access
to
court
claims
fall
into
two
categories:
first
our
own
decisions
have
recognized
forward
looking
access
claims,
claims
that
systematic
or
systemic
official
action
frustrates
a
plaintiff
or
a
class
of
plaintiffs
in
preparing
and
filing
suits
at
the
present
time.
when
i
say
the
present
time,
i
mean
the
time
when
the
suits
can
be
pursued
once
the
frustrating
condition
has
been
removed.
second,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
recognized
backward
looking
claims
of
denial
of
access
in
which
a
plaintiff
claims
that
official
action
has
precluded
him
from
bringing
or
satisfactorily
litigating
a
specific
suit
that
cannot
be
pursued,
no
matter
what
official
action
maybe
in
the
future.
but
regardless
of
whether
an
access
claim
is
forward
looking
or
backward
looking,
the
point
of
recognizing
is
to
provide
an
effective
vindication
for
a
separate
and
distinct
right
to
seek
judicial
relief
for
some
wrong,
namely
the
past
or
prospective
loss
of
a
legal
claim
or
form
of
relief.
accordingly,
in
both
cases,
both
kinds
of
cases,
a
plaintiff
must
identify
the
foreclosed
or
a
predicate
claim
or
relief
sought
and
must
do
this
as
part
of
the
access
claim
itself
just
as
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
identify
any
other
element
of
the
access
claim.
there
is
particular
need
for
care
in
stating
the
predicate
lawsuit
here
because
it
may
implicate
separation
of
powers
issues
as
to
the
role
of
courts
in
foreign
affairs.
harbury
wishes
to
bring
a
backward
looking
access
claim,
but
she
fails
to
make
such
a
claim
because
she
is
not
identified
a
predicate
claim
or
a
remedy
that
could
be
obtained
by
the
access
claim
but
not
obtainable
by
some
other
lawsuit
right
now.
the
court
of
appeals
allowed
harbury
an
informal
amendment
to
clarify
her
predicate
claim.
her
counsel
responded
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
she
would
have
brought
an
action
for
intentional-infliction
of
emotional
distress
against
the
cia
defendants
who
were
complicit
in
her
husband’s
torture
and
death
as
the
wrong
for
which
she
would
have
sought
the
injunctive
relief
that
might
have
saved
her
husband’s
life.
but
the
complaints
intentional-infliction
in
related
counts
naming
the
cia
defendants
are
among
the
tort
claims
that
survived
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court.
no
government
deception
prevents
her
from
suing
right
now
on
those
claims.
therefore,
if
she
has
any
backward
looking
access
claim
at
all
it
must
be
because
she
can
get
some
relief
on
the
access
claim
that
she
cannot
get
on
the
intentional-infliction
claim.
the
only
relief
she
has
suggested
that
she
cannot
get
on
the
present
intentional-infliction
claim
if
she
can
make
good
on
it
is
an
order
that
might
have
spared
her
husband’s
life,
but
this
does
not
entitled
her
to
bring
a
backward
looking
access
into
court’s
claim
because
she
cannot
get
such
an
order
under
the
access
claim
either.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
