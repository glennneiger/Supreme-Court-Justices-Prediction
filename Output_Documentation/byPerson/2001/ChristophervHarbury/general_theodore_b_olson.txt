mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
five
years
ago
in
its
glucksberg
decision,
the
court
urged
utmost
care
in
creating
new
substantive
due
process
rights
because
doing
so
removes
the
matter
from
the
arena
of
public
debate
and
legislative
action.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that
is
the
allegation,
and
that's
a
conclusionary
information
and
belief,
easy
to
allege,
hard
to
disprove
allegation
that
can
be
made
in
every
one
of
these
cases.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
justice
o'connor,
even
if
she
had
gone
with
well,
she
f-
if
she
i
wouldn't
put
it
as
exhaustion.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
we
believe
that
there
is
not.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
scalia,
what
they
did
say
is
that
and
this
is
on
page
twenty
of
the
transcript
in
the
oral
argument,
and
there
is
something
similar
in
the
in
the
brief,
that
they
had
that
they
we
can't
get
back
to
you
or
we're
not
able
to
respond
to
you
they
suggested
that
that
would
be
a
perfectly
constitutional
response,
or
as
you
say,
a
no
comment
would
be
a
perfectly
constitutional
response.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
pardon
me?
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
no
comment
might
not
be
a
lie,
justice
stevens,
but
but
at
but
this
the
the
respondent
specifically
says
it
would
have
been
constitutional
to
say
i
cannot
get
back
to
you,
or
if
there
is
information,
we're
not
in
a
position
to
give
it
to
you.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
i
i
hesitate
ever
to
say
anything
of
that
sort.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
situation,
justice
chief
justice
rehnquist,
in
which
if
something
is
delayed
and
i
think
justice
scalia
asked
that
question.
