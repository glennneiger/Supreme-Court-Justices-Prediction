mr.
cordray,
one
of
your
one
of
your
arguments
here
is
essentially
a
lack
of
standing
argument
that
the-
that
there's
no
remediable
harm
that's
been
suffered.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
obtaining
in
obtaining
damages
that
is,
see
had
she
known
this
information
sooner,
she
could
have
brought
suit
sooner
and
would
have
obtained
justice
sooner.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
am
not
talking
about
i
am
not
talking
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
been
at
least
delayed?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
answer
to
that
is,
yes,
well,
you
know
but
but
meanwhile,
she
hasn't
gotten
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
yeah
but
well
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
take
her
complaint
the
way
the
way
justice
souter
wrote
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
injunction
is
against
the
payment
which
she
says
is
the
only
reason
the
guatemalan
military
are
doing
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
be
so
cavalier?
it's
close
to
the
line.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
could
allege
that
the
drying
up
of
information
was
also
done
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
bringing
a
lawsuit,
that
is,
if
you
say
no
comment.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
allege
the
only
reason
you
said
no
comment
was
you
didn't
want
to...
justice
antonin
scalia
well
an-
and
i
assume
that
that
would
have
been
part
of
your
of
your
lawsuit,
that
you
would
have
had
to
establish
that
it
is
either
what?
a
violation
of
a
federal
statute
or
of
the
constitution
to
to
permit
torture.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
relying
on
the
statutes
or
lack
of
statutory
authority...
