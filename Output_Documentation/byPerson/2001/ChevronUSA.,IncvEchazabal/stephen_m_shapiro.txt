mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
according
to
the
national
institutes
of
health,
hepatitis
c
kills
8,000
to
10,000
people
in
this
country
every
year,
and
it's
the
largest
cause
of
liver
transplants.
this
is
a
progressive
disease,
which
in
many
cases
goes
without
any
symptoms
for
a
period
of
time,
but
in
a
large
percentage
of
cases,
it
results
in
cirrhosis
and
liver
failure.
the
disease
in
this
instance
was
chronic,
active,
and
severe,
according
to
the
standards
of
the
nih.
now,
niosh's
occupational
health
guidelines
also
confirm
that
the
chemicals
in
this
factory
were
liver
toxins.
the
ordinary
worker
can
withstand
that
exposure,
which
is
consistent
with
osha
standards.
but
the
government's
guidelines
say
again
and
again
that
employees
should
receive
medical
tests
before
beginning
work
to
look
out
for
special
vulnerability.
niosh's
statement
about
phenol,
one
of
the
12
chemicals
here,
is
typical,
and
i
quote
from
the
guideline.
liver
damage
may
occur.
persons
with
a
history
of
abnormalities
of
the
liver
would
be
expected
to
be
at
increased
risk
from
exposure.
now,
none
of
this
matters
according
to
the
ninth
circuit
because
injury
to
self
is
beyond
the
employer's
legitimate
concern.
but
we
believe
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
its
structure
tell
a
completely
different
story.
the
defense
provision
in
the
statute,
which
is
section
12113(a),
first
speaks
in
general
terms.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
found
on
page
59a
of
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
59a,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
begins
on
58a,
but
the
pertinent
provision,
12113(a),
is
right
there
on
59a.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
the
general
provision
says
it
is
permissible
to
use
qualification
standards
and
tests
that
are
job-related
and
consistent
with
business
necessity.
this
is
generic
language
and
it
does
not
exclude
injury
to
self.
after
this
general
provision,
the
statute--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the...
the
first
part
is
12113(a),
which
states:
in
general.
that's
the
general
defense
provision.
and
right
after
it
comes
a
particular
example
in
subpart
(b),
which
refers
to
risks
to
other
individuals.
and
that,
of
course,
is
just
an
example
that
fits
within
the
general
rule
here,
and
we
know
it's
just
an
example
because
congress
said
that
permissible
standards
may
include
such
a
test.
this
is
obviously
not
an
exhaustive
description.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
think
the...
the
phrase,
may
include,
is
illustrative
of
matters
that
might
fit
into
the
general
description
that
comes
just
before
and
that
injury
to...
to
other
persons
and
injury
to
self
are...
are
both
matters
that
fit
within
the
general
description
of
business
necessity,
public
safety--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
found
several
instances
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
where
congress
was
talking
about
injury
to...
to
the
individual
himself.
so,
again,
it's
not
an
exclusive
reference.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute,
justice
o'connor,
it
again
helps
to
answer
this
question.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
might
be
an
inference
from
that
language--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
express
language.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
think
it's...
it's
particularly
weak
because
the...
the
provision
that
comes
right
before
this
provision
that
deals
with
discrimination
makes
it
clear
that
the
employer
may
use
medical
examinations
and
may
make
an
offer
of
employment
contingent
on
the
results
of
those
medical
examinations.
that's
in
the
discrimination
section.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
in
section
12112(d),
which
is
quoted
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
7.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
at
reply
brief
page
7.
it
says
the
employer
may
require
a
medical
examination
and
may
condition
an
offer
of
employment
on
the
results
of
that
examination.
again,
the
focus
is
perfectly
general
in
scope.
the
exam
is
lawful
if
it
is
job-related
and
consistent
with
business
need.
now,
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
resort
to
legislative
history
in
this
case,
but
there
is
a
conference
report
here
that
stated
that
this
act
does
not
intend
to
override
any...
any...
legitimate
medical
standards
or
requirements
established
by
employers
for
safety-sensitive
positions.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we...
we
deny
that
he
was
a
qualified
individual.
we
make
two
arguments:
one,
that...
that
we
have
a
business
necessity
not
to
hire
somebody
who
would
be
killed
in
this
particular
job,
but
also
that
he's
not
qualified.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
absolutely.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i...
i
would
agree
with
that,
and
we--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
qualification
standard
focuses
on
whether
he
can
perform
the
job
on
an
ongoing
basis
in
the
near
term.
and...
and
if
the
person
would
become
seriously
ill
or
die
in
the
near
term,
that
person
can't
carry
out
the
job
functions.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
is
linguistic
overlap
and
there
is
practical
overlap.
a
person
who
is
not
qualified
is
a
person--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--our
view
is
that
there's
overlap
between
qualification
and
business
necessity.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
but
they're
not
coextensive.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
the
first
question.
the
second
question
is,
if
he
is
qualified,
because,
as
justice
o'connor
said,
he
can
do
the
job
in
the
short
run,
which
we
don't
think
he
can,
then
the
question
is
whether
we
have
a
business
need
to
retain
him.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
our
principal
submission.
our
backup--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we...
we...
it's
one
of
our...
we
have
several
arguments
in
the
alternative,
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
believe
we...
we
can
win
the
case
on
that
ground.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
and
we
think
that
that
regulation
is
perfectly
consistent
with...
with
the
general
defense
provision,
and
we
believe
we
can
win
the
case
under
that
regulation
and,
indeed,
that
it's
entitled
to
chevron
deference
because
this
agency
had
legislative
rulemaking
power
to
issue
that
standard.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
i
would
note
that
the...
the
agency
in
its
cert
stage
amicus
brief
said
that
the
qualification
issue
is
whether
the
individual
can
perform
the
job
in
the
near
term.
and
we
agree
with
that.
but
we
say
this
person
cannot
do
that
because--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--but
you'll...
you'll
note--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--absolutely.
that's
just
a
brief--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
they
say...
they
say
helpful
things
in
the
brief
too.
they
note
that
firemen
and...
and
airline
pilots
and
others
that
would
succumb
to
an
illness
while
they're
conducting
their
jobs
in
the
near
term
are
disqualified.
they're
not
qualified
to
do
the
job.
and
the
reason
is
that
safety
considerations
are
paramount
there,
they
say.
well,
they're
paramount
in
this
refinery
too.
there
were
five
physicians
here
who
said
this
individual
was
at
imminent
risk
of
death--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it's
an
old
story,
your
honor.
some
people
do
not
listen
to
their
doctors.
i
won't
speculate
on--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
if
you
read
the
cases
that
we've
cited,
it's
amazing
how
frequently
people
with--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we...
we
don't
assume
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
say
he...
he
is
like
the
steel
worker
with
vertigo
who
can
fall--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--off
the
beam
at
any
moment--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
hope
not.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
this
statute
rejects
that
thesis
in
the
medical
examination
provisions,
recognizing
that
the
employer
has
a
stake
in
this
issue.
there
are
many
legitimate
interests
that
the
employer
has.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
arguably
it
would,
your
honor,
because
this
is
a
known
hazard.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
should...
it
should
factor
into
the
business
necessity
evaluation
because
we
do
have
a
business
necessity
to
avoid
violating
state
law
and
federal
law.
and
here
there--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
would
point
to
the
general
duty--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--oh,
i...
i
see
we...
we
didn't
put
it
in
our
appendix,
but
it's
the
general
duty
provision
of
the
osha
statute
cited
in
our
opening
brief
and
our
reply
brief.
and
what
it
says
is
that
if
you've
recognized
a
hazard,
you
cannot
send
the
employee
into
the
jaws
of
that
hazard.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it's
the
general
duty
clause--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
we'll
supply
it
for
you.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
are
several--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--several
interests.
there...
there
is
federal
law
compliance.
there
is
state
law
compliance.
there
is
state
tort
law
liability
that
we're
concerned
about.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it...
it
could.
it
certainly
could.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
we
would
hope
that
preemption
would
work
that
way,
but
preemption
issues
in
the
states
court
often
do
not.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
yes,
there
still
is.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's...
that's
preservation
of
employment
relations,
avoidance
of
adverse
publicity,
and...
and
fear
of
criminal
responsibility.
there
have
been
many
criminal
prosecutions,
and
courts
never...
never
hold
that...
that
general
criminal
laws
are...
are
preempted
by
federal
safety
legislation.
so,
i
don't
think
that's...
that's
any
defense
in
that
situation.
there
are...
in
all
well-run
businesses
today,
the
model
of
the
business
is
safety
is
our
business.
for
100
years
in
this
country,
the
industrial
policy
has
been
safety
comes
first.
so,
this
is
per
se
a
legitimate
business
interest
in
this
context.
now,
our...
our
friend's
argument
to
the
contrary,
interestingly,
is
an
exact
replay
of
the
argument
that
was
made
to
the
eeoc
back
in
1991
when
the
agency
adopted
its
rules.
the
argument
was
made
then
that
if
you
refer
to
risk
to
self,
it's
going
to
encourage
paternalism
and
encourage
negative
stereotypes.
but
the
agency
rejected
that
argument,
explaining
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
was
inconsistent
with
a
long
line
of
cases
under
the
rehabilitation
act.
and
the
agency's
judgment
here,
we
believe,
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
was
evaluated
under
a
different
legal
standard,
the
bofq
standard,
which
is
much
more
stringent.
this
court
has
said
the
business
necessity
standard
is
more
flexible
and...
and
permissive.
and
that
was
a
case
where
the
government
said
there
was
no
serious
risk,
and
all
you
had
to
do
is
take
a
simple
precaution
and
the
lead
would
not
injure
the...
the
fetuses
of...
of
the
woman.
and
there
was
discrimination
between
the
sexes,
which
was
the
real
thrust
of
the
court's
decision,
and
there's
nothing
like
that
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
exactly.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
business
necessity
applies
to
any
screening
test
or
medical
examination
or
qualification
standard
that
the
employer
uses.
and
this
was
something
that
the
business
community
fought
hard
for
in
congress
to
get
this
flexible
test.
it's
repeated
three
or
four
times
in...
in
title
i
of
the
statute,
and...
and
to
disregard
it
here
we
think
defeats
the
very
basis
of
this
legislation.
i
see
i've
used
a
great
deal
of
my
time.
i
wonder
if
i
might
reserve
the
balance
of
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
stewart's
opinion
for
the
court
in
the
dothard
case
contained
an
excellent
rebuttal
to
the
argument
we've
just
heard.
he
stated
that
safety
is
not
romantic
paternalism.
safety
is
a
basic
business
necessity
in
this
country.
that's
the
culmination
of
100
years
of
industrial
policy.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
we
think
it
does.
the
court
discussed
both
kinds
of
danger,
danger
to
the
individual
and
danger
to
other
people.
and
this
court
twice
has
said
in
dothard...
in
beezer...
the
beezer
case
later...
that
safety
is
a
paradigm
business
necessity.
and
indeed,
it...
it
is
the
paradigm,
safe
and
efficient
operations
of
business.
and
this
is
not
a
statute
that
cut
out
risks
to
self.
this
is
a
statute
that
included
risks
to
self
in
the
business
necessity
defense.
that's
generic
language
that
encompasses
it.
and
there
was
a
long
line
of
cases
that
congress
meant
to
adopt
under
the
rehab
act.
they
didn't
disapprove
those
cases.
in
fact,
business
necessity
is
repeated
four
different
times
in
the
statute,
and
it's
applied
specifically
to
medical
examinations
of
the
individual
employee.
congress
wasn't
talking
about
general
tests.
it
was
talking
about
examinations
like
the
one
given
to
mr.
echazabal.
now,
this
court
has
held
that
under
the
business
necessity
defense,
it
will
not
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
employer's
judgment.
all
that
is
needed
is
a
reasonable
relationship
to
a
legitimate
business
objective.
there
certainly
is
a
legitimate
business
objective
here
in
saving
this
individual's
life
and
promoting
safety
in
the
plant.
was
the
judgment
a
reasonable
one?
we
had
four
opinions
from
experienced
physicians.
we
spoke
with
mr.
echazabal's
own
physician.
we
told
him,
did
you
realize
this
man
would
be
exposed
to
liver
toxins,
and
he
said,
no,
that
should
not
be
done.
someone
with
hepatitis
c
can't
even
have
a
drink
of
alcohol,
much
less
liver
toxins.
