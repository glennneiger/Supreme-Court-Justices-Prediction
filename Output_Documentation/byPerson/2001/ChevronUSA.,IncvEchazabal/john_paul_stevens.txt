actually
it's
58a,
1211(a),
at
the
bottom--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
first
referred
to
the
general
rule.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
ms.
blatt?
do
you
think...
does
the
government
think
that
it
was
proper
for
the
district
court
to
enter
summary
judgment
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
have
a
position
on
the
question
whether,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
defendant
has
sustained
the
burden
of
proof
that
it
was
a
reasonable
medical
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
asking
what
the
eeo
argued
below.
i'm
asking
what
is
the
government's
position
on
that
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
inappropriate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
just
for
a
moment?
perhaps
you're
right
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
the
legal
rule
that
you're
contending
for
seems
it
would
apply
even
if
the
risk
was
99
percent
and
2
weeks
from
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
sure
can
you
be
about
that?
there
are
people
who
smoke
when
they
know
the
risk
is
very
clear.
there
are
people
who
will
take
serious
risks
because
they
need
to
earn
money
to
support
a
family,
and
they
often
will
do
things
their
doctors
tell
them
not
to
do.
but
you
say
they
have
an
absolute
right
to
take
whatever
the
risk
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i...
i
want
to
also
get
your
view
on
that
because
there's
another
aspect
of
the
case
that
i'm
puzzled
by.
mr.
shapiro
at
the
beginning
said
that
everybody
else
in
the
plant
is
safe
under
the
osha
standards
and
so
that
only
this
person
is
at
risk.
is...
do
you
agree
with
that,
or
is
there
also
risk
to
everybody
else
in
the
plant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
a
hypothetical
that
i...
i
can't...
haven't
quite
been
able
to
think
through?
assume
that
the...
that
an
employee
has
to
be
able
to
lift
at
least
200
pounds
in
order
to
be
safe
in
a
particular
assignment.
and
one
employee
can't
lift
200
pounds
because
he's
just
not
any
stronger
than
a
lot
of
other
people,
and
another
employee
can't
do
it
because
he's
disabled.
could
they
fire...
could
they
deny
the
employment
of
the
disabled
person
in
that
hypo?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
if
the...
if
standard
oil
had
a...
had
a
qualification
that
anyone
with
hepatitis
beyond
a
certain
degree
is
ineligible
for
employment,
that
would
be
okay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
some...
some
neutral
standard
that
whatever...
they
phrase
it
in
medical
terms,
and
if
you
cross
the
threshold,
you're
at
too
much
of
a
risk
and
we'll...
we
won't
employ
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
afraid
you
haven't
thought
about
the
christian
scientists
in
this...
in
this
community.
