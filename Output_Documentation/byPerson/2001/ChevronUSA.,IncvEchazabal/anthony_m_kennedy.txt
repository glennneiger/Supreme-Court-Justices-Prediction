justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
mr.
shapiro,
as
i
go
through
this
statute,
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
beginning
on
page
58a,
12118,
do
you
concede,
for
purposes
of
the
statutory
analysis,
that
the
employee
here
was
a
qualified
individual?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
as...
as
you
see
the
case,
could
we
dispose
of
the
case
by
reading
just
1211...
121118
and
end
it
right
there--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
find
what
we're
talking
about
in
defenses
just
does
not
bear
on
our
determination
one
way
or
the
other?
obviously,
you
look
at
the
whole
context
of
the
statute
to
make
sure
that
what
you're
doing
is
consistent...
consistent
with
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
we
ultimately--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
we
ultimately
asking
the
question,
is
he
qualified?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
let
me...
when
we
go
through
the
whole
statute,
including
121113,
do
you
ultimately
say
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
after
reading
the
whole
statute,
he
is
not
qualified,
as
that
term
is
used
in
8?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
federal
statute
said
this
is...
this
preempts
any
inconsistent
duty,
that
the
employer
is
not
liable
for
compliance
with
this
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume...
let's
assume
it
does.
is
there
still
a
business
necessity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
is
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought
justice
o'connor's
question
was
somewhat
broader.
obviously,
we
understand
your
statutory
position.
but
the...
the
point
of
her
question
at
least,
as...
as
i
began
to
consider
it,
was
whether
or
not
in
this
society,
it's...
it's
wrong
to
say
that
an
employer
should
care
about
its
employees.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
very,
very
important
policy
to
further,
and
your
position
wants
an
employer
to
take
a
position
that
could
be
completely
barbarous.
you
have
an
employee
who
has
severe
mobility
problems
near
dangerous
machines
where
he
could
be
maimed,
and
you
say
that
that's
just
irrelevant.
i
think
that's
a...
an
argument
that's
very
demeaning
to
a
society
that
wants
to
encourage
good
conduct
on...
on
the
part
of
its
employers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
order
to
avoid
paternalism,
we're
going
to
tell
employers
they
can
just
commit
their
employees.
