59a?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there's
some
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
indeed
it
wasn't
intended
to
allow
review
of
danger
or
risk
to
the
employee
himself.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--where
do
we
find
that?
reply
brief?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
hard
to
say
he's
not
qualified
when
he
worked
there
for
the
other
contractor
in
the
same
circumstances
for
20
years
or
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
you
don't
even
rely
on
the
eeoc
regulation?
at
least
you're
not
arguing
from
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
regulation
specifically
says
the
individual...
the
threat
to
the
individual
can
be
considered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
went
beyond
the
clear
terms
of
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
the
case
that
it
would
violate
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
for
chevron
to
hire
this
person
under
those
circumstances?
do
we
know
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
have
to
be
considered
then
in
the
balance
of
qualification?
and
the
court
below,
i
guess,
didn't
resolve
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
section
of
the
osha
would
you
point
to
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
it...
is
it
in
the
material
before
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
you
can
supply
it
later
rather
than
take
your
time
now--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--because
we
would
be
interested.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
workman's
comp
go
up
if...
if
he
suffers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
have
a
physician's
exam
and
report.
is
that
enough?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
this--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so,
is
that
enough
in...
in
the
view
of
the
government?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
take
the
position
in
the
brief
that
perhaps
it
isn't.
i
was
curious
about
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
tell
us,
if
you
would,
why
the
employee
would
want
to
take
a
job
where
the
doctor
says
it's
going
to
kill
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
toxins
will
cause
your
early
death.
now,
why
does
the
employee
want
that
job?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
is
it
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
there
some
room,
though,
for
the
argument
that
it...
there
may
be
a
business
necessity
not
to
hire
somebody
who's
going
to
be
killed
as
a
result?
you
do
have
osha
standards.
you
do
have
workmen's
comp
premiums
that
get
jacked
up
if
some
employee
is
injured
on
the
job
or
made
ill
because
of
the
job.
you
have
probably
labor
relations
problems
as
a
result
of
having
somebody
put
at
risk
on
the
job.
there...
there
are
arguments
there
for
a
business
necessity
defense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
but
notwithstanding
the
regulation,
just
looking
at
the
provisions
of
the
act
as
applied
in
this
case,
how
do
we
deal
with
that
business
necessity
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
wasn't
that
a
case
involving
a
broad
category
of
all
women
of
child-bearing
age
whether
or
not
you
were
dealing
with
a
specific
individual
who
had
been
told
by
the
doctor
you
better
not
do
this.
that
was
a
broad
categorical
rule.
here
we're
dealing
with
an
individual
and
individual
circumstances.
does
that
make
a
difference,
do
you
think?
i
mean,
i
would
think
johnson
is
a...
a
very
sound
concept
as
applied
to
broad
categories,
but
i'm
not
sure
it
covers
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
the
doctor
decide.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
goes
to
the
issue
on
remand
if
there
is
one.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
the
legal--
