justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
out
of
curiosity,
why
does
he
want
to
kill
himself?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you
say...
i
mean...
the
reason
i
ask
that
question
is
i
suspect
in
any
real
case,
since
people
don't
really
want
to
kill
themselves,
there's
an
argument
about
how
risky
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
all
those
other
cases,
it
seemed
to
me...
in
all
the
cases
that
you
cited--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
was
a
different
issue
at
stake,
and
that
in
part
was
whether
he
could
do
the
job.
and
here,
perhaps
unrealistically
we
are
assuming,
for
the
sake
of
this
case,
that
he
can
do
the
job
perfectly
well.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you
don't.
but
suppose...
i
don't
know.
i
thought
the
issue
is
presented
in
the
context
where
we're
forced
to
make
that
assumption.
i
don't
think
anyone
denies
that
if
he
can't
do
the
job
with
reasonable
accommodation,
you
have
the
right
not
to
hire
him.
i
don't
know
that
anyone
denies
that
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
if
that's
correct...
does
anyone
doubt
that
proposition
of
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
all
right.
so,
this
becomes
serious
as
a
matter
of
law
only
if
we
assume
that
he
can
do
the
job.
and
i
just
wonder
under
those
circumstances
whether
in
any
real
case
the
issue
isn't
an
argument
about
how
risky
it
is,
and
if
that's
so,
my
question
would
be,
why
doesn't
this
statute
try
to
leave
that
matter
up
to
him?
if
he
does
the
job
for
you
okay,
that's
your
business.
and
if
he
wants
to
run
greater
risks
than
you
think
he
should,
that's
his
business.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
reg?
because
normally
you
should,
of
course,
defer
to
the
agency's
regs.
i
understand
that.
but
this
particular
reg
is
surprising
the
way
it's
written;
that
is,
it
doesn't
say
there
are
a
lot
of
qualification
standards.
one
of
them
is
a
direct
threat
to
individuals,
contagious
disease
problem.
another
one
is
the
suicidal
employee.
rather
it
has
the
definition
of
the
word,
direct
threat,
and
that's
where
it
sticks
the
word
self.
and
it
appears
then
to
be
talking
about
a
definition
in
the
statute,
direct
threat
to
others.
and
it
defines
direct
threat
to
others
as
direct
threat
to
self
and
others.
now,
if
what
it's
doing
is
explaining
the
words,
direct
threat
to
others,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
define
the
words,
direct
threat
to
others,
to
deal
with
a
completely
different
kind
of
problem
involving
direct
threat
to
self.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
left
out
three
things.
it
says,
direct
threat
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
individual
or
others.
see
1630.2(r)
defining
direct
threat,
which
refers
you
back
to
the
reg
in
which
what
they
seem
to
be
doing
is
defining
the
words,
direct
threat.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
against
even
the
most
extreme
case,
which
this
may
not
be.
i
mean,
that's
hard
to
see
that.
i...
i...
but
i'm
particularly
curious.
what
about
the
reg?
i
mean,
there
it
is.
i
take
it
your
clients
in
this
instance
don't
like
the
reg,
but
more
often
than
not,
the
eeoc
regs
are
quite
favorable
to
disabled
people.
so...
so,
how
can
we
say,
well
in
this
case
we're
paying
no
attention
to
the
reg,
but
in
some
other
case
you'll
be
back
here
arguing
we
ought
to
pay
a
lot
of
attention
to
the
reg.
so,
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
explain
why
it
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
tell
me
how
i
write
this
sentence
in
the
paragraph
that
says
the
reg
doesn't
matter?
i
say,
oh,
they
were
sneaking
this
one
in?
i
don't
think
i
can
write
that.
[laughter]
what
is
it
i'm
supposed
to
say
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
clear,
that's
right,
but
i
find
it
pretty
hard
to
say
it's
clear
when
you
start
talking
about
extreme
cases.
i
mean,
maybe
this
isn't
one
of
them,
but
you
have
the
carpenter
who's...
you
know.
i
mean,
you
know,
we
can
make
them
up.
i
think
they're
very
hypothetical.
i
doubt
very
much
they
really
exist,
but
you're
asking
for
a
rule
that
encompasses
those
hypothetical,
far-out
cases,
and
there
i
see
the
reg.
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
find
it
difficult
because
i
think
the
subject
matter
of
the
potentially
suicidal
worker
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
problem
of
contagious
diseases.
and
so,
i
find
it
very
hard
to
say
that
in
writing
about
contagious
diseases,
they
were
saying
anything
whatsoever
about
suicides.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
tell
me
about
the
reg.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
not
telling
me
about
the
reg.
i
want
to
know
how
to
avoid...
from
your
point
of
view,
you
want
me
to
avoid
the
fact
that
i
owe
deference
to
a
reg
of
the
agency.
so,
i
want
to
know.
i
know
the
normal
rule
is
i
owe
that
deference.
so,
what's
special
about
this
in
respect
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
if
we're
focusing
on
our
concern
about
extreme
cases,
of
which
this
may
not
be
one,
have
you
thought
of
a
form
of
words
that
might
cabin
those
off
if
they
ever
occur,
which
would
give
some
meaning
to
the
reg?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what's
the
form
of
words?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
can...
if
you
apply
it,
you
could
think
of
an
extreme
case
where
the
person
is...
you
know,
the
suicidal
worker,
i'm
going
to
die
with
my
boots
on
and
i
hope
tomorrow.
i
mean,
there
may
be
such
people,
and...
and
okay.
so,
that's
what
maybe
this
reg
is
about.
i
don't
know.
it
doesn't
say
it
isn't.
and...
and
what's
the
form
of
words
that
would
cabin
off
those
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
give
me
the
form
of
words,
however
you
want
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that's...
that's
extreme.
i
mean,
people
may
want
to
die
with
their
boots
on.
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
move
people.
some
don't
believe
it,
et
cetera.
so,
is
there
a
serious
form
of
words
that
you
could
say,
well,
if
it's
really
one
of
those
cases,
it
might
be
a...
a
situation
that
falls
within
the
reg?
and
you're
telling
me
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
there
is
no
form
of
words.
