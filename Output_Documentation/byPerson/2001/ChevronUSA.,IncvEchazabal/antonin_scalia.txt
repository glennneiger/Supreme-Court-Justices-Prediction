justice

it's...
surely
it's
exclusive
to
some
extent.
i
mean,
mr.
shapiro,
you
certainly
wouldn't
argue
that
a
qualification
could
include
a
requirement
that
the...
that
the
individual
not
pose
an
indirect
threat
to
the
health
or
safety
of
other
individuals.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
so,
i
guess
the
question
is
how
strong
is
the
exclusionary
inference--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where...
where
is
that
now?
what
are
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
12113
specifically
deals
with
qualification
standards.
i
mean,
don't
you
think
that
the
qualification
standards
portion
has
to
be
read
in
pari
materia
with
the...
with
the...
with
the
provision
defining
a
qualified
individual?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
two
are
addressing
exactly
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
wouldn't...
you
wouldn't
say
that...
that
a
person
is
not
a
qualified
individual
if
he
would
pose
an
indirect
threat
to
the
health
or
safety
of
others,
would
you?
because
that's
clearly
excluded.
you
cannot
use
that
as
a
qualification
standard.
i...
i
just
don't
think
it's
an
easy
way
out.
i
just...
it
is
in
another
section,
but
i
think
that
other
section
has
to
be
read
to...
to
be
corresponding
to
the
qualification
standards.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
just
in
the
brief,
though.
they
didn't
issue
a
rule
to
that
effect,
did
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we're...
we're
not
paying
any
attention
to
what
they
say
in
briefs,
are
we?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
were...
you
were
about
to
say
why
the...
the
employer
has
an
interest
other
than
the
mere
charitable
one
in
not
letting
an
employee
kill
himself.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
is...
what
are
the
interests?
justice
antonin
scalia
other
than
not
violating
osha.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
have
one
question.
i
guess
it's
a...
maybe
a
soft
variety
of
the
expressio/exclusio
argument.
but
the
theory
of
chevron
deference
is
that
the...
that
the
congress
basically
left
a
blank
place
to
be
filled
in
in
whatever
way
the
agency
think
is
best.
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
leave,
as
it
were,
a
hiatus
on
the
question
of
individual
safety
when
it
specifically
attended
to
safety
of
others?
it
just
seems
like
an
odd
thing
to
leave
up
to
the
agency
when
it
was
that
close
to
the
subject
in...
in
what
it
did
require.
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
congress
thought
like
justice
breyer,
that
it's
quite
implausible
that
anybody
would
want
to
kill
himself.
right?
i
mean,
it...
it
is
not
something
that
leaps
to
mind,
that
you...
you
have
to
stop
somebody
from
taking
a
job
that's
going
to
kill
him,
whereas
stop
somebody
from
taking
a
job
in
which
he's
going
to
hurt
somebody
else,
that's
something
you
would
worry
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
address
whether...
whether
that
argument
is
true
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
blatt,
i...
i
find
it
peculiar
to
say
he
was
a
qualified
individual
but
he
didn't
meet
the
employer's
qualification
standards.
i
mean,
what
is
a
qualified
individual
except
one
who
can
do
what
the
employer's
standard
says
has
to
be
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
once...
once
you
eliminate
the
stereotyping
as,
you
know,
justice
souter
was...
was
inquiring
about,
i
don't
see
why
congress
would
be
so
adamant
about
paternalism
for
the
handicapped
but
not
adamant
about
paternalism
for
everybody
else.
i
mean,
if...
if
i
don't
have
a
handicap,
i
have
some
disability
that...
that
does
not
qualify
as
a
handicap,
and
i
want
to...
i
want
to
work
in...
in
a
particular
job,
and
it's
dangerous,
and
under
osha
rules
i
don't
have
any
right
to
say,
paternalistic
state,
get
out
of
here.
i'm
willing
to
accept
the
risk.
you
can't
do
it.
why...
why
is
congress
only
worried
about
paternalism
for
the
handicapped?
once
you
eliminate
the
stereotyping,
you
have
individual
determination
that
this
person
is...
is
going
to
be
harmed.
why
does
congress
say,
if
it's
a
disabled
person,
he
can
kill
himself,
but
if
it's
not
a
disabled
person,
oh,
no,
you
can
let
him
kill
yourself?
why
would
congress
want
to
make
that
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
doctors?
i
mean,
this
requires
medical...
medical
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
age
discrimination
problem
here?
