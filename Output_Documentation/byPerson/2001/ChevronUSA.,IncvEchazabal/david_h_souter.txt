justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
reason
you
make...
i
think
the
reason
you
make
that
argument
is
essentially
the...
the
paternalism
theory.
congress
rejected
paternalism.
but
isn't
what
congress
rejected
a
combination
of
paternalism
and
stereotype?
it
rejected
the
kind
of
johnson
controls
situation
which
would
say
all
women
are
at
risk.
here
you
can
call
it
paternalism
if
you
want
to,
but
at
least
the...
the
medical
claim
is
that
there
is
a
determination
of
risk
specific
to
this
individual.
and
can
we
say
that
congress
rejected
the
employer's
authority
to
take
that
into
consideration?
no
stereotype.
specific.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
as
i
understand...
i
want
to
come
back
to
that,
but
go
ahead.
i
don't
want
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
was
just
going
to
say
with
respect
to...
when
you
get
to
the
regulation
itself,
one
answer
from
the
government
was
that
the...
the
reason
the
regulation
mentioned
threats
to
others
is
that
there
was...
there
was
case
law
on
the
point,
and
there's...
there
really
isn't
comparable
case
law
on
threats
to
individuals.
so
that
one
way
to
read
what
congress
did
was
to
say
it
wanted
to
preserve
the
law...
the
case
law
that
there
was
and
leave
the
rest
open.
what
do
you...
what
do
you
say
to
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
the...
the
question
is
how
plainly.
and...
and
here's
the
problem
that
i
have,
just
as
a
technical
matter,
without
even
getting
to
the
suicidal
patient.
you
make
a
very
good
argument
about
the
contrast
between
what
congress
wrote
in
the
old
eeoc
regs.
as
against
the
force
of
that
argument,
you've
got
the
text
of
the
statute
that
refers
to
the
qualifications,
including
threats
to
others.
so,
in
the...
you
know,
the
very
breath
that
they're
giving
your...
an
example,
they're
saying,
and
there
can
be
all
kinds
of
other
things
too.
it
may
very
well
be...
i
don't
know.
it
may
very
well
be
that,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested
earlier,
they
were
talking
about
other
kinds
of
examples
on
other
subjects.
but
i
don't
know.
it's
not
clear
to
me,
and
that's
the
point
at
which
chevron
deference
becomes
crucial.
how
can
i
say
it
is
so
plain
that
congress
was
excluding
a...
a
chevron
treatment?
justice
david
h.
souter
absolutely,
but
i
don't
know
how
to
draw
the
line.
that's
my
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
that
gets
back
to
the
point
that
several
have
raised
and
that
is
paternalism
combined
with
stereotype,
yes,
i
understand.
that's
out.
johnson
controls
is
out.
but
paternalism
alone?
particularly
where,
as
justice
scalia
has
said,
paternalism
for
the...
for
the
non-disabled
is...
is
alive
and
well
in
osha.
that's...
that's
not
so
easy
for...
for
me
to
follow.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
that
may...
that
may
simply
get
us
down
to
a
very
important
point
but
not
a
point
here,
and
that
is,
the...
a
sufficiency
of
evidence
point
or
a...
or
a
sufficient
specificity
of
evidence
point.
and
that's...
that's
not
what
we've
got.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
first
of
two
cases
i
have
to
announce
this
morning
is
number
00-1406
chevron
usa
inc
against
echazabal.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
of
1990,
the
ada
prohibits
employers
from
adapting
job
qualifications
that
screen
or
tend
to
screen
out
individuals
with
disabilities.
the
act
provides
employers
with
an
affirmative
defense
however.
the
job
qualifications
that
are
shown
to
be
job
related
inconsistent
with
business
necessity.
the
statute
says
that
these
job
qualifications
may
include
a
requirement
that
an
individual
shall
not
pose
a
direct
threat
to
the
health
or
safety
of
other
individuals
in
the
workplace.
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
has
gone
one
step
further.
with
a
regulation
extending
the
direct
threat
defense
to
risks
that
the
job
may
pose
to
the
disabled
workers
own
health
or
safety.
beginning
in
1972,
the
respondent
mario
echazabal
worked
for
independent
contractors
at
one
of
the
petitioners
chevron
usa's
oil
refineries.
in
1995
echazabal
applied
for
a
job
directly
with
chevron
but
chevron
refused
to
hire
him
because
of
the
liver
condition
he
had
which
chevron's
doctors
said
would
be
aggravated
by
continued
exposure
to
toxins
at
the
refinery.
chevron
further
asked
echazabalâ€™s
contractor
to
reassign
him
or
if
necessary
as
it
is
proved
today
to
remove
him
from
the
refinery.
echazabal
filed
suit
claiming
that
chevron's
refusal
to
hire
him
or
even
to
let
him
continue
on
in
the
plant
was
discrimination
because
of
his
disability.
chevron
defended
under
the
eeoc's
regulation
permitting
an
employer
not
to
hire
someone
whose
performance
of
the
job
would
pose
a
direct
threat
to
his
own
health.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
chevron;
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
so-called
threat
to
self-defense
exceeded
the
scope
of
permissible
rule
making
allowed
by
the
ada.
in
the
unanimous
opinion
filed
today
were
the
clerk
of
the
court
we
reverse
and
remand.
the
eooc'd
regulation
is
entitled
the
deference
so
long
as
the
ada
does
not
unambiguously
precluded
and
the
regulation
is
reasonable.
we
find
both
conditions
to
be
met
in
this
case.
although
the
statute
goes
out
of
its
way
to
tell
employers
that
they
need
not
hire
workers
who
would
pose
threats
to
other
individuals
in
the
workplace.
this
does
not
close
the
door
to
other
valid
qualification
standards
that
the
employer
may
adapt.
for
example
would
a
meat
packer
who
refuse
to
hire
typhoid
mary
be
defenseless
simply
because
she
posed
a
risk
to
others
outside
the
workplace
but
not
clearly
within.
the
question
shows
that
little
can
be
read
by
way
of
negative
implication
from
congress's
specification
of
a
defense
to
threat
pose
to
others
in
the
workplace.
we
further
find
the
eeoc's
regulations
to
be
reasonable.
by
requiring
that
employers
who
seek
to
a
certain
threat
to
self
defense
do
so,
only
after
an
individualized
medical
assessment
of
the
risk
of
the
employers
will
face
on
the
job,
the
regulations
strikes
an
adequate
balance
between
advancing
workplace
safety
without
fostering
workplace
paternalism.
