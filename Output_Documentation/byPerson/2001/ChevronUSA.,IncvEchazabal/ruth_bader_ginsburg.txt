bader

and
why
isn't
it
an
exhaustive
description
at
least
of
that
category,
of
the
category
of
direct
threat
to
health
or
safety?
i
can
see
that
the
words,
may
include,
may
include
this
and
it
may
include
that,
but
when
the...
when
the
congress
is
describing
direct
threat
and
it
has
only
the
health
of
other
individuals,
why
for
that
part
isn't
it
self-contained?
i
mean,
you
say
it
has
a
plain
meaning.
it
would
have
been
much
plainer
if
congress
had
said:
of
the
individual
or
others,
if
that's
what
it
meant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you
give
the...
then
you
give
the
agency
no
deference
at
all
when
the
agency
says,
yes,
of
course,
he's
a
qualified
individual.
he
can
do
the
job.
he's
done
it
and
he
hasn't
dropped
dead
for
those
20
years.
but
so
you
say
don't
give
the
eeoc
any
respect
on...
on
the
qualified
individual,
but
give
them
chevron
deference
on
the
12113.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
it's
kind
of
when
you
like
what
the
agency
says,
you
respect
it,
and
when
you
don't
like
it,
you
don't
respect
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
you
agree
with
what
they
said...
they
have
spelled
it
out
what
their
position
is
in
their
brief,
and
they
said,
in
no
uncertain
terms,
this
is
a
qualified
individual.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where...
where
is
the
text
of
that
that
you're
reading
now?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
that
the
argument
that
was
made
in
johnson's
control
that
this
is
unsafe
the...
the...
allowing
a
woman
of
child-bearing
capacity
to
work...
was
it...
what
was
the
toxic
substance--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that...
that
the
same
kind
of
evidence
that
you
have
about
how
dangerous
it
was,
it's
as
dangerous
to
the
woman,
dangerous
to
the
fetus?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
the
bfoq
goes
together
with
an
explicit
sex--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
do
they
call
it?
disparate
treatment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
here...
and
the
business
necessity
goes
with
neutral
rule
disparate
effect.
are
you
saying
that's
what
we
have
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
district
court
saying
that
those
two
other
doctors
don't
count
because
they
weren't
before...
i
thought
you
had
just
said,
in
response
to
an
earlier
question,
that
that
would
be
open
if
the...
on
remand,
the
question
of
whether
this
person
was
in
fact
a
risk
to
himself
because,
as
i
understand
it,
there
were
two
witnesses
that
said
he...
he
was
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
district
judge
said
they
didn't.
the
district
judge
said,
i
reject
those
two
witnesses.
they
come
too
late.
goodbye.
summary
judgment.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so,
you
think...
you're
saying
the
district
court
erred
as
to
that
extent
in
saying
summary
judgment,
no
trial.
this
person
is
a
danger
to
himself.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shapiro,
i
thought
that
was
safety
of
others
because
didn't
dothard
make
the
distinction
between
the...
the
risk
to
the
individual
woman,
which
was
up
to
her?
what
dothard
said
is,
this
prison
is
a
jungle.
by
her
presence,
she
is
endangering
everyone
else
in
the
place.
there
are
going
to
be
riots.
so,
i
think
dothard
doesn't
work
for
you
at
all.
