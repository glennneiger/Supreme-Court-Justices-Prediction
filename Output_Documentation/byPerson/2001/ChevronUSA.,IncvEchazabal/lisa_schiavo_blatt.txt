ms.
lisa
schiavo

thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
could
first
address
just
how
the
statute
works
with
respect
to
whether
an
individual
is
qualified.
it
proceeds
in
two
basic
steps.
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
he
can
perform
the
essential
fundamental
job
tasks
of
the
job
and
that
he
satisfies
the
employer's
other
qualification
standards.
now,
if
a
particular
qualification
standard
screens
out
someone
because
he
is
disabled,
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
employer
to
justify
that
standard
as
job-related
and
consistent
with
business
necessity.
and
what...
the
eeoc's
regulatory
threat
to
self
regulation
is
one
example
of
a
subset
of
a
valid
standard
that
is
job-related
and
consistent
with
business
necessity.
the
statute
recognizes
that
a
valid
qualification
standard
may
include
a
safety
requirement
that
an
individual
not
pose
a
safety
threat
to
others
in
the
work
place.
the
eeoc
has
reasonably
concluded
that
a
parallel
defense
is
available
if
the
individual
would
pose
a
significant
safety
threat
to
himself.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
the
context
is
very
important
here.
what
the
direct
threat
to
others...
the
statutory
threat
to
others
defense...
is
is
a
codification
of
this
court's
decision
in
arline,
and
that
arose
in
the
context
of
a
teacher
with
a
contagious
disease
that
posed
a
direct
threat
to
others.
but
congress
expressly
anticipated
that
other
types
of
safety
threats
would
be
addressed
by
the
more
general
business
necessity.
congress
simply
didn't
address
safety
threats
to
self
or
safety
threats
to
others
in
the
public
and
not
necessarily
the
work
place.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
threat
to
self
context
can
come
up
where
an
employee
wants
to
either,
a,
assume
the
risk
or,
b,
there's
a
disagreement
about
whether
that
risk
in
fact
exists.
now,
the
question
is,
is
when
an
employer
can
prove,
meet
a
burden
of
showing
a
documented
and
scientific
basis
for
finding
a
significant
risk
of
substantial
harm,
the
employer
has
legitimate
interests
in
refraining
from
injuring
or
killing
its
workers.
the
mere
fact
that
the
employee
consents
to
that
risk
cannot
trump
the
employer's
interests,
no
more
than
it
could
if
the
employees
agreed
to
assume
the
risk
of
working
in
an
environment
with
a
person
with
tuberculosis.
in
both
cases,
the
employer
has
legitimate
interests.
now,
at
the
same
time,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
was
concerned
about
employment
decisions
based
on
stereotype
or
group-based
predictions
and
unfounded
fears
about
disabled
people
posing
safety
threats.
and
what
the
regulations
do
is
carefully
balance
the
employer's
legitimate
interest
with
the
rights
of
disabled
persons
to
be
free
of
these
prejudicial
decisions
by
requiring
an
individualized
determination
that
looks
at
the
person's
actual
medical
condition
and
recognizes
that
disabilities
pose
varying
levels
of
side
effects
and
limitations
or
safety
threats
and
requires
an
objective
determination
based
on--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--the
regulations
require
it
to
be
based
on
objective
or
other
medical
examination.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
and
that
may...
well
may
be.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
in
the
view
of
the
government,
if
the
medical
opinion
is
reasonable,
then
that's
enough.
now,
in...
in
this
case--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--the
position
that
the
eeoc
argued
to
the
ninth
circuit,
which
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
address
and
would
be
available
on
remand,
was
that
there
was
a
factual
dispute
that
summary
judgment
should
not
be
entered
on
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
determination.
but
employers
are
entitled
to
rely
on
the
reasonable
medical
judgments
that
reflect
available
current...
current
medical
knowledge.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
with
all
due
respect,
justice
breyer,
what
the...
what
the
agency
did...
and
it's
on
page
60a
of
the
petition...
is
said
that
a
valid
qualification
standard
includes
a
requirement
that
there
not
be
a
direct
threat
to
the
individual.
and
then
it
separately
defined
direct
threat
in
terms
of
the
way
direct
threat
was
defined
by
congress.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
but
what...
what
the
agency
did,
as
a
matter
of
administrative
convenience
in
protecting
the
rights
of
disabled
persons,
is
that
in...
in
crafting
a
regulatory
threat
to
self
defense,
it
wanted
to
ensure
that
the
same
protections
would
be
given
to
workers
and
that
there
had
to
be
a
showing
of
a
significant
risk
of
substantial
harm.
at
the
same
time,
this
was
beneficial
to
employers.
so
they
wouldn't
be
confused
by
two
different
standards,
it
would
be
the
same
standard.
the
agency
could
have
accomplished
the
same
result
had
it
said,
well,
we
want
this
direct
threat
to
others
that
follows
the
statute
and
as
far
as
threats
to
self
were
concerned,
it
could
have
just
avoided
using
the
word,
direct
threat,
and
said,
don't
adopt
a
qualification
standard
unless
it
screens
out
significant
safety
risks
that
cause
substantial
harm.
so,
the
mere
fact...
it
was
administrative
convenience
to...
to
have
a
parallel
defense
and
using
the
terminology
of
direct
threat.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes,
on
the...
the
eeoc
argued
that
the
summary
judgment
on...
on
direct
threat
with
respect
to
petitioner's
argument.
and
that
would
be
available
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
consider
on
remand
if
this
court
upheld
the...
the
regulation.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
petitioner
is
arguing
that
its
medical...
physicians
advised
that
there
was...
that
there
was
a
direct
threat
here.
and
what
respondent
argued
in
response
to
that
on
summary
judgment
is
that
those
decisions
weren't
reasonable.
and
we
just
think
the
parties
have
a
genuine
fact
dispute
about--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--it's...
but
what's
relevant
is
not
that
the
opinions
were
submitted
late,
it's
whether
at
the
time...
the...
the
relevant
inquiries
at
the
time
the
employment
decision
is
made,
but
you
can
still
ignore
what
the
medical
literature
says
and
make
an
unreasonable
decision.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
united
states
hasn't
independently
briefed
it,
but
that
is
what
the
eeoc
argued
to
the
ninth
circuit.
and
it
does
turn
on
complicated
medical
questions
that
would
be
appropriately
addressed
by
the
ninth
circuit
on
remand.
what...
what
we
think
this
court
should
do
is
hold
that
respondent
was
a
qualified
individual,
but
the
employer
is
entitled
to
show
that
he's
not
qualified
because
it
has
a
valid
qualification
standard
that--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--the
eeoc
argued
below
no.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
don't
know
what
the
united
states'
position
on
that
is,
but
we
don't
have
any
reason
to
disagree
with
the
eeoc.
we
just
haven't
independently
looked
at
it.
but
the
eeoc
certainly
makes
a
reasonable
argument
that
there
was
a
factual
dispute
on
it
and
summary
judgment
was
inappropriate.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
inappropriate,
right,
that
there
was
a
genuine
fact
dispute
about
whether
the
direct
threat
test
was
met
here,
and
we
think
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
able
to...
to
address
that
in
the
first
instance.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right,
that
because
there
is
a
valid
regulation
that
the
eeoc
promulgated
and
it's
entitled
to
deference,
it
should
be
upheld,
and
there's
just
a
question
about
whether
it
was
met
in
this
particular
case.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
may
i
answer,
mr.
chief
justice?
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it's
just...
if
i
could
give
you
the
example
of
the
airline
pilot
with
a
contagious
disease.
he's
qualified
to
fly
the
plane,
but
he
may,
nonetheless,
pose
an
unacceptable
safety
risk,
and
that's
a
valid
qualification
standard
to...
to
not
hire
him.
it's
just
a
question
of
burden
of
proof
basically,
justice--
