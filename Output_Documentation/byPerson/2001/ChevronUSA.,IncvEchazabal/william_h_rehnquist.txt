chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
that,
mr.
shapiro?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
one
is
the
general
provision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
shapiro.
ms.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
bagenstos,
we'll
hear
from
you.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
conceivable
that
someone
would
not
be
disabled
but
still
be
in
a
position
where
the...
he
would
propose
a
risk
to
himself
similar
to
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
surely
the
employer
can
say
no
in
that
situation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
it
say
that?
that's
the
question
we're
all
interested
in.
it
certainly
was
entitled
to
say,
but
i
don't
believe
you
can
point
to
any
particular
place
where
it
specifically
says
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
you...
you
have
to
push
beyond
the
analogy
from
direct
threat
to
indirect
threat
to...
to
get
that
far
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you're
discriminating
against
people
with
hernias
probably.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
if
the
employer
says,
we
require
everybody
to
have
a
prognosis
of
living
for
at
least
2
years
on
the
job?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
i'm
talking
about
just
across
the
board.
one
of
the
things
that
we
require,
regardless
of
what
you're
condition
is,
is
we
want...
we
want
your
life
expectancy
to
be
at
least
2
years.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bagenstos.
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
