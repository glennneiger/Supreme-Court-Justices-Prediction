mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
exclusion
of
individuals
with
disabilities
from
jobs
for
their
own
protection
was
a
principal
target
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act,
but
the
threat
to
self
defense
proposed
by
chevron
here
would
provide
affirmative
legal
authorization
for
precisely
that
sort
of
conduct.
for
three
principal
reasons,
we
think
it
clear
that
congress
did
not
authorize
such
a
threat
to
self
defense,
the
first
simply
being
the
statutory
text
and
particularly
the
change
from
the
eeoc's
prior
regulations
under
the
rehabilitation
act
which
specifically
included
a
threat
to
self
disqualification
to
the
ada's
direct
threat
provision
which
is
limited
to
threats
to
others.
the
second
being
the
consistent
jurisprudence
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
a
statute
that
provided
a
significant
model
for
title
i
of
the
ada,
that
also
responds
in
significant
measure
to
a
problem
of
paternalistic
discrimination
and--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i...
i
think
that--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
think
there
aren't
really
employees
who
want
to
do
that.
i
think
justice
breyer
and
justice
scalia's
points
made
in
the
first
half
of
the
argument
are
well
taken.
when
congress
was
looking
at
this
issue,
it
wasn't
thinking
about
the
largely
fanciful
case
where
the
employee...
where
the
employee
wants
to...
wants
to
go
into
a
suicidal
situation,
but
was
thinking
about
the
run
of
cases
where,
you
know,
there...
there's
a
small
risk,
there's
an
overstatement
of
the
risk,
there's
some
dispute
about
the
risk.
the...
and
then
the
question
is
who
decides.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
and...
and
here
i
think
it's
clear
there's
a
dispute
about
the
nature
of
the
risk.
i
think
it's
also
clear
if
you
look
to
what...
even
the...
even
the
testimony
of
chevron's
doctors
is
here.
it's
a
small
risk.
right?
so...
so,
when
the...
when
the
doctors
are
asked
what
is
the
probability
that
this
is
going
to
happen,
they
can't
put
a
number
on
it.
dr.
tang
closest
he...
who
is
the...
who
is
the
most
credentialed
doctor
for
chevron's
side
of
the
case,
the
closest
he
can
come
is
he
says,
well,
something
like
1
percent.
this
is
at
page
88
of
the
joint
appendix.
so,
what
we're
really
saying
here
is
that,
you
know,
people
get
injured
in
this
work
place
from
time
to
time.
maybe
there's
a
1
percent
incremental
risk.
even
if
you
accept
chevron's
argument--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--i
think
that...
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and...
and
my
response
to
justice
o'connor
was
i
think
it's
appropriate
in
crafting
a
rule
for
congress
to
think
that
the
99
percent
death
2
weeks
from
today
cases
aren't
really
going
to
arise,
that
the
run
of
cases
are
going
to
be
like
this.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
well,
i...
i
think
they
have...
they
have
the
same
right
as
people
who
don't
have
disabilities.
a
very
important
point
is
that
the
question
is...
the
question
here
is...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
would
you
like
to--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i...
i
think
that
the
testimony
of...
of
the
two
experts
on
our
side
of
the
case...
this
is
why
i
say
it's
disputed.
the
testimony
of
the
two
experts
on
our
side
of
the
case
is
to
the
effect
that
if
there
is
a
risk
for
mr.
echazabal,
there
is
a
risk
for
everyone
else
in
the
plant.
but
the
real
issue
is
not
whether
the
employer
can
take
steps
to
make
its
work
place
safe.
the
real
issue
is
whether
the
employer
or
the
employee
gets
to
make
the
decision
whether--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--i...
i...
of
course,
it's
possible.
that's
absolutely
right.
and
we
don't
have
any--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
think...
i
think
what
the
employer
can
do...
the
employer
can
certainly
do
whatever
it
wants
with
respect
to
people
who
don't
have
disabilities
as
defined
in
the
statute,
at
least
as
far
as
the
ada
is
concerned.
but
again,
the...
the
question
here
is
we
have
an
individual
who
is
excluded
precisely
because
the
employer
believed
that
his
disability
rendered
him
unsafe.
and
the
question
is
who
gets
to
decide
whether
this
job
is
too
unsafe.
is
it
the
employer?
is
it
the
employee?
we
believe
that...
that
congress
firmly
left
that
decision
in
the
hands
of
the
employee.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
i
think...
i
think
we
can
say
that.
i
think
we
can...
we
can
say
that
because
of
the
reference
to
over-protective
rules
and
the
statutory
findings.
we
can
say
that
because
of
congress'
lopping
off
of
the
threat
to
self
disqualification
that
had
previously
appeared
in
the
eeoc
regs.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
well,
i...
i
was
done
with
that
point.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
well,
i
think...
i
think
that...
that
i
may
misconstrue
their
argument,
but...
but
certainly...
certainly
as
to
the
state
of
the
rehabilitation
act
law
at
the
time
the
ada
was
adopted,
there
was
a
specific
regulation
by
the
eeoc.
it's
quoted
in
the
petition's...
petition
appendix
at
page
61,
right,
that
specifically
said
a
person
is
qualified
only
if
he
can
perform
the
essential
functions
of
the
position
in
question
without
endangering
the
health
or...
and
safety
of
the
individual
and
others.
congress
in
42
u.s.c.
12201(a)
adopted
by
reference
the
rehabilitation
act
regulations,
at
least
as
a
floor
for
protection
under
the
ada.
this
is
one
instance
where
congress
actually
departed
from
what
the
prior
rehabilitation
act
regulations
did.
we
think
that...
that
has
particular
significance,
particularly
in
light
of
the
consistent
drum
beat
not
just
in
the
statutory
findings,
not
just
in
the
legislative
history
at
the
hearing
stage,
at
the
committee
report
stage,
at
the
floor
stage,
but
also
consistently
in
title
vii
law,
this...
this
distinction
between...
between
excluding
people
based
on
risk
they
pose
to
others
and
excluding
people
based
on
risk
they
pose
to
themselves.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
well,
i
think...
i
think
there
may
be
arguments
there.
i
think
that
they...
i
think
that
they're
misplaced
as
a
justification
across
the
board
for
a
threat
to
self
defense
as
the
eeoc
has
adopted.
worker's
compensation
premiums--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
think
i'd
say
two
things
about
that.
first,
i
think
that...
i
think
that
the
decision
that
congress
made
in
12113(b),
the
direct
threat
provision,
to
say
specifically
this
is...
this
is
a
defense
that
is
limited
to
significant
risks,
because
that's
how
it
defines
direct
threat,
and
risks
to
others,
i
think
that...
that
in
and
of
itself
suggests
that
congress
has
foreclosed
a
business
necessity
defense
for
anything...
anything
relating
to
safety
risk
that
falls
outside
the
terms
of
it,
just
as
congress
couldn't...
just
as
an
employer
could
not
say,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
well,
we're
excluding
this
person
because
of
an
indirect
threat,
but
there's
a
business
necessity
for
it.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
certainly--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
think
that
this
court
confronted
basically
the
same
argument
in
the
johnson
controls
case,
that
the
employer
said...
the
employer
said,
look,
we
have
a
moral
interest
in
the
safety
of
our
employees.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
well,
i...
i
mean,
two
points
with
respect
to
that.
one
is
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
as...
as
the
employment
discrimination
law
moves
from
title
vii
which
deals
with
large
groups
to...
to
disability,
which
as...
as
this
court's
definition
of
disability
decisions
indicate,
is
a
very
individualized
kind
of
a
concept.
right?
i
mean,
two
people
who
have
the
same
medical
diagnosis,
one
may
have
a
disability,
one
may
not,
this
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized.
necessarily
the
kind
of
intentional
discrimination
we're
talking
about
is
going
to
be
intentional
discrimination
against
a
person
because
of
his
particular
disability
as
opposed
to
because
of
some
broader
group
membership.
i...
i
would
suggest
that
there...
there
is
exclusion
on
the
basis
of
some
kind
of
group
membership
even
in
a
case
like
this.
anyone
with
chronic
hepatitis
c
would
be
excluded
by...
by
what
chevron--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
think
two...
two
points.
one
is
if
it's
a
disabled
person,
he
still
has
to
be
subject
to
the
same
osha
rules
as
everyone
else.
but
two,
why
is
congress
concerned
about
paternalistic
discrimination?
i
mean,
i...
i
think
a
significant
part
of
it
is
the
concern
that
over
the
run
of
cases,
there's...
when
an
employer
looks
at
an
individual
with
a
disability
and
the
risk
posed
by
that
individual
to
himself,
history
has
shown...
and
there's
ample
evidence
of
this
in
the...
in
the
legislative
record...
history
has
shown
that...
that
there
is
likely
to
be
an
over-emphasis,
an
over-determination
that
there
is
in
fact
a
risk.
the--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--by
doctor...
by
doctors,
company
doctors,
as
occurs...
as
occurred--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of...
of
whose
ox
is
gored.
right?
i
mean,
i
think
why
this
reg--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--right.
and
why
this
reg
doesn't...
ought
not
to
get
deference,
it
seems
to
me,
is
because
what
the
eeoc
is
basically
doing
is
sneaking
back
into
its
regulation
a
piece
of
the
rehabilitation
act
regulation
that
was
cut
out
by
congress.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
well,
i...
i
think
that
deference
doesn't
apply
when
congress
has
explicitly--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--so,
two...
two
points
about
the
extreme
cases,
i
mean,
if
that's
what
we're
focusing
on.
the
first
point,
as...
as
your
honor
acknowledges,
far-out
probably
don't
exist.
when
congress
writes
a
rule,
it
doesn't
write
a
rule
for
the
extreme
cases.
it
writes
a
rule
for
the
run
of
cases.
so,
it
wouldn't
be
crazy
to...
to
read
congress...
what
congress
said
as
not--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
think
that...
i
think
that
one
of
the...
one
of
the
changes
that
the
ada
makes
in
the
direct
threat
provision
is
broadening
that
from
contagious
diseases
to
all
other
kinds
of
risks,
number
one.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
right,
right.
so,
number
two,
about...
about
the
reg,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
some
of
the
extreme
cases,
a
lot
of
them,
maybe
all
of
them,
the
person
will
fail
on
the
qualified
individual
standard.
a
person
who's
going
to
die
by...
simply
by
walking
on
the
job,
simply
is
unable
to
perform
essential
functions--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i...
i
think
that
the
question...
the
question
is,
as
i
said,
whether
congress
has
spoken
to
the
matter
with
respect
to
whether
an
employer
can
exclude
an
individual
based
on
risk
to
self,
and
we
say
that
congress
has
spoken
to
that
matter
in
12113(b),
the
direct
threat
provision.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
okay.
two
points,
one
textual,
one
contextual.
the
textual
point,
directly
on...
on
this
provision,
i
think
goes
back
to
what
justice
scalia
said
in
the
first
half
of
the
argument
which
is
just
because
it
begins
with
may
include,
doesn't
mean
that
everything
that
follows
it...
everything
that
follows
it
doesn't
place
any
limitations
on
everything
that
precedes
may
include.
congress
said,
you
know,
qualification
standards
may
include
a
direct
threat
to
others--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--and...
and
i
think
the
contextual
point
helps
answer
that
with
the...
the
consistent
statements
both
in
the
statutory
findings
and
in
this
provision,
the
change
from
the...
from
the
rehabilitation
act
regs,
and
consistently
in
the
legislative
history,
including
that
specifically
referring
to
this
particular
provision
saying
the
reason
why
we
cut
this
language
out
basically
is
in
order
to
say
that
paternalistic
determinations,
determinations
by
employers
for
the
safety
of
employees,
for
the
safety
of
the
particular
excluded
employees,
should
not
be
permitted
to
justify--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--paternalism
for
everybody,
the
non-disabled,
as
well
as
the
disabled--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--taken
as
a
whole...
i...
i
agree
is
taken
kind
of
as
part
of
the
osha.
i...
i
think
that
it's
certainly,
as...
as
i
meant
to
say
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
there
certainly
is
a
concern
for
stereotyping
here.
the
question
is
whether
congress
meant
to
permit...
or
meant
to
require
employees
to
have
to
prove
stereotyping
in
each
case.
that
is...
that
is,
congress
could
have
made
a
class-based
decision
that
most
of
the
time
when
we
have
an
exclusion
of
an
individual
with
a
disability
because
of
a
conclusion
that
his
disability
makes
him
unsafe,
that...
that
is
likely
to
be
informed
by
some
degree
of
stereotyping
or
the...
the
incentives
that...
that
employers'
doctors
have
to
exclude
people
rather
than
hire
them
and
take
the
steps
necessary
to
protect
them
as
the
american
public
health
association
makes
clear
in
its
brief.
so,
stereotyping
is--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
the
problem...
right.
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
congress
then
has
two
choices.
do
you
require
plaintiffs
to
prove
in
every
case
that
there
is
stereotyping
in
addition
to
paternalism?
or
do
you
presume
essentially
paternalism
entails
stereotyping
when
it's
paternalistic
discrimination?
it's
not
paternalism
at
large,
not
paternalism
visited
on
all
employees.
and
i
think
that
congress,
given
the
history
recounted
over
and
over
in...
in
the
hearings,
was
entitled
to
say
that
we're
just
going
to
make
a...
a
broad
class
of--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
think
that...
i
think
that
the
closest
is
that
just
as
the
direct
threat
provision
excludes
an
indirect
threat
as
a
basis
for...
for
excluding
someone,
so
too
does
the
threat
to
others
language
there
exclude
threats
to
self.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
well,
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
know
that
you
have
to
push
beyond
the
analogy.
i
mean,
it's...
i
would...
i
would
say,
with
respect,
it
seemed...
it
seems
like
it's
precisely
parallel
statutory
language.
there
are
two
limitations
in
the
12113(b)
direct
threat
provision.
one
is
direct
threat
defined
as
significant
risk,
and
the
other
is
risk
to
others.
it
seems
like
if
you're
going
to
override
either
of
those
limitations
under
the
guise
of
the
general
12113(a)
qualification
standards
defense,
then
any
purpose
congress
had
for
including
those
limitations
in
that
direct
threat
provision
is...
is
going
to
be
rendered
meaningless.
and
so...
so,
i
think
that's
the
concern
there.
and
this
is
not...
this
is
not
a
concern
that's...
that's
unique
to
the
ada.
it's
a
concern
that
this
court
approached
under
title
vii.
i
think
the
important
answer
that...
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
justice
kennedy's
point
before...
is
that
this
is
not
a
statute,
even
under
our
reading,
that
prevents
employers
from
taking
steps,
taking
lots
of
steps,
to
protect
their
employees.
it
just
eliminates
one
thing
they
might
do,
and
that
is
simply
exclude
an
employee
who,
because
of
a
disability,
is
determined
to...
to
pose
an
undue
risk.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
neutral
qualification
standard.
that's
the
paradigm
case
of
a
neutral
qualification
standard.
that
is
what
12113(a)
is
about.
asking
everybody--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
think
the
point...
the
point
of
its
neutrality
in
the
lifting
hypothetical--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
think
if
they
have
to
ask
themselves
what
is
your
medical
condition,
do
you
have
hepatitis
c,
which
hepatitis
c
is
a
disability
in
this
case,
then
it's
no
longer
neutral.
then
what
they're
doing
is
engaging
in
intentional
discrimination
against
that
person
because
of
his
condition.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
what
they
say
is
we
require
everybody
to
lift
200
pounds,
we
don't
care
if
the
reason
you
can't
lift
200
pounds
is
because--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
[laughter]
well,
it...
it
would
certainly
screen
out
people
with
hernias,
and...
and
therefore
would
prima
facie
violate
the
screening
out
provision
of...
of
the
statute
unless
there
were
a
business
necessity
justification.
this
is
precisely
the
context
in
which
there
would
be
a
business
necessity
justification
under
the
statute
where...
where
an
employer
says
we
require
everybody
to
satisfy
the
standard.
we
don't
care.
we
don't
even
ask
what's
the
reason
why
you
can't
lift.
we
give
you
200
pounds
and
say,
lift
if
for
us,
and
if
you
can't
do
it--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
[laughter]
--right.
if
the
employer
did
that,
i
mean,
i
think...
i
think
that
that
would
be
something...
that
would
be
something
that
goes
a
lot
closer
to
a
qualification
standard
that
is
neutral.
now,
the
concern
in
that
case
is,
number
one,
is
it
really
neutral?
that
is,
is
it
the
case
that
they
say
only
to
people
with
disabilities,
people
with
medical
conditions
that
constitute
disabilities,
we
think
that
you
fail
this
test.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
i
think
that
they
could
do
that
if
they
could
justify
it
as
job-related
and
consistent
with
business
necessity,
which
might
be
very
difficult.
the
business
justification
i
suppose
would
be
we
don't
want
turnover
in
employment,
but
there's
a
lot
of
turnover
for
a
lot--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
[laughter]
--there
might
well
be
an
age
discrimination
problem
there.
disparate
effects,
you
know,
depending
on
whether
disparate
effect
is
recognized
under
that
statute.
but...
but
under...
as
far
as
the
ada
is
concerned,
certainly
it's
the
case
that
they
would
be
able
to
assert
a
business
justification,
but
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
in
that
case
to
actually
prove
the
business
justification
because
it's
only...
if
it's
only
people
who
are
going
to
die
in
2
years,
however
we
predict
that,
who
are
excluded
from
employment
and
not
people
who
are
going
to
take
a
better
job,
not
people
who
are
going
to
leave
because
they
fall
in
love
and
move
to
a
different
city
or
leave
to
take
care
of
a
sick
parent...
i
mean,
there
are
thousands
of
reasons
why
job
turnover
occurs.
if
they
single
out
something
that
screens
out
people
with
disabilities,
that's
obviously
very
different.
but
the
crucial
point,
it
seems...
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
in
this
case
what
we
have
and
in
the
class
of
cases
on
which
the
legal
question
presented
addresses...
what
we
have
is
a
choice
effectively
of
who's
going
to
decide
whether
a
job
is
too
risky
for
a
particular
individual
in
a
context
where
there
are
general
rules
like
osha
that
are
complied
with.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
well,
i
think
that
the
individual
will
certainly...
will
certainly
follow
the
dictates
of
his
own
doctor
in
most
cases.
and
when
the
individual
doesn't,
i
mean,
there
are
obviously
cases
where
people--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--right.
well,
i
mean,
i
think...
i
think
that
raises
obviously
distinct
issues.
but...
but
yes,
i
think
that...
people
will
obviously
consult
with
their
doctors.
i
mean,
what's...
what's
notable
here
is
that
chevron
purported
to
consult
with
echazabal's
doctor,
didn't
really
give
him
all
the
information,
didn't
get
it,
didn't
ask
him
whether
there
was
a
significant
risk,
but
never
put
the
doctor
in
contact
with
echazabal,
just
purported
to
have--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--right,
no--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--i...
i
agree
with
that.
i...
i
agree
with
that
really
does
go--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--i--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--i
don't
know
that
i
can
give
any
meaning
to
the
reg
that's--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--well,
i
think
that
the
cabining
would
have
to
be
external
to
the
regulation.
i
think
it's...
i
think
it's...
to...
to
say--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--okay.
and
i
think
that
the
cabining
is
threefold.
number
one,
an
employer
can
exclude
someone
who
is
not
a
qualified
individual
with
a
disability,
which
many
people
who
pose
such
an
extreme
present
risk
themselves
will
be.
number
two,
an
employer
can
apply
neutral
qualification
standards
that
are
job-related
and
consistent
with
business
necessity.
and
number
three,
if
we
have
someone
who
really
is
bent
on
committing
suicide
by
employment,
there
are
state
law
commitment
remedies
available
for
such
people,
people
who
can't--
[laughter]
and
no--
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
--i...
i
think
outside
of
the
situation...
the
first
two
situations
that
i
spoke
of
where
the
person
isn't
qualified
or
where
the
person
is
excluded
under
a
neutral
job-related
and
consistent
with
business
necessity
qualification
standard,
that
i
would
suspect
excludes
everybody
except
what
we've
now
described
as
the
really
extreme
cases.
mr.
samuel
r.
bagenstos
well,
i
think
the
crucial
point
is
that,
i
mean,
there
are
due
process
limitations
on
commitment
which
there
are
not
for
employers.
and
that's
the
crucial
point,
justice
kennedy.
if...
if
we
say
that
employers
get
to
decide
willy-nilly
this
is
too
unsafe,
that's...
that's
a
very
different
kind
of
a
process.
of
course,
commitment
is
only
in
a
very
extreme
circumstance,
and
we
have
procedures
to
make
sure
that
independent
decision
makers
make
those
decisions
with
full
knowledge
of
the
facts
not
employers
here
and
then
forcing...
forcing
employees
to
come
to
court
and
fight
for
6
years
to
prove
that
they
really
weren't
a
risk
to
themselves.
and...
and
that
we
think
is
the
reason
why
congress
excluded
the...
excluded
the
notion
that
an
employer
could
make
the
decision
instead
of
the
employee
as
to
what
is
too
unsafe.
and
we
would
then
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
