justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
bederman?
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
the
certiorari
petition,
did
anyone
point
out
the
fact
that
maybe
the
state
was
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
1983
and
that
that
was
the
reason
not
to
take
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
only
after
monetary
relief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
a
right
of
the
state
of
georgia
to
protect
the
individual
employees,
and
the
state
of
georgia
has
said
the
right
to
an
interlocutory
appeal
is
not
all
that
important.
you
have
the
substantive
defense
that
you
just
can't
because
georgia
has
its
own
choice
of
whether
it's
better
to
have
this
decided
after
the
whole
case
or
in
the
middle.
they
think
it's
better
to
wait
till
the
case
is
over.
now,
why
can't
georgia
make
that
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
shouldn't
that
decision
also
influence
the
tactical
decisions
of
the
attorney
general
when
he's
litigating?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
the
state
of
georgia's
legislature
who
have
made
the
decision
that's
troubling
for
the
state
of
georgia's
employees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you're
not...
they're
not
elongating
the
case.
they're
trying
to
terminate
it
in
a
hurry
in
this
particular--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
just
don't
understand
how
that
could
possibly
be
sanctionable
conduct
if
we
say
it's
a
proper
usage
of
the
removal
statute
and
it
doesn't
waive
sovereign
immunity.
they'll
do
it
all
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
question
is
whether
this
particular
maneuver
is...
is
authorized
by
law
or
not.
and
if
it's
authorized
by
law,
it
surely
isn't
improper.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
maybe
there
is
sanctionable
conduct
here
because
you
have
a
conflict
of
interest.
your
interest
in
the
employees
is
definitely
directly
opposed
to
your
interest
representing
the
state.
so,
maybe
you
should
have
gotten
separate
counsel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
once
more?
i
hate
to...
i'm
sorry--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
interrupting
so
many
times.
but
is
it
your
position
that
the
general
rule
should
be
that
removal
waives
the
state's
sovereign
immunity,
but
there
should
be
an
exception
when
there's
a
good
reason
because
of
a
conflict
of
interest?
or
is
your...
your
position
is
that
it
will
never
waive
sovereign
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
absent
a
state
legislature...
you're
arguing
for
a
general
rule,
not
just
for
a
rule
that
will
protect
you
in
this
particular
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
excuse
me.
to
the
extent...
i
didn't
hear
the
word.
