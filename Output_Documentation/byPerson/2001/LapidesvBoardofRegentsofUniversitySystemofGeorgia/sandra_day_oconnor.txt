justice
sandra
day
o'connor
explain
to
me
whether
we've
ever
bifurcated
forum
immunity
from
immunity
for
suit...
from
suit?
i
just...
do
we
treat
the
two
differently?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
a
waiver
of
forum
immunity
as
opposed
to
immunity
from
suit?
is
there
such
a
distinction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
could
be
adjudicated
in
state
court,
couldn't
they?
the
federal
issues?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
they
don't
like
here
is
no
interlocutory
appeal
i
gather.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
the
state's
own
fault.
i
mean,
the
state
could
have
an
interlocutory
appeal
if
it
chose
to
do
so,
couldn't
it?
