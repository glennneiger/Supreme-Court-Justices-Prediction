ms.
devon
orland
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state,
along
with
its
employees,
removed
this
case
to
federal
court
so
that
its
employees
could
take
advantage
of
a...
in
a
federal
forum.
this
does
not
amount
to
a
waiver
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
is
not
a
clear
and
unequivocal
expression
of
the
state's
desire
to
waive
its
immunity,
and
second,
the
attorney--
ms.
devon
orland
--your
honor,
this
court
has
never
made
such
a
distinction,
and
the
first
i've
ever
heard
of
the
concept
of
forum
immunity
being
parceled
out
from
the
rest
of
the
immunity
was
in
this
case.
apparently
there
was
a
recognition
at
some
point
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
that
the
federal
claims
would
be
barred
even
in
state
court,
and
then
they've
come
up
with
this
forum
immunity
concept.
ms.
devon
orland
your
honor,
the
concept
of
what--
ms.
devon
orland
--your
honor,
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
found
in
pennhurst,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
has
also
found
in
pennhurst
that
the
absence
of
that
choice,
that
concrete
choice,
would
emasculate
the
eleventh
amendment.
so,
what
is
being
argued
is
by
the
exercise
of
procedural
device
for
the
benefit
of
our
employees
would
cause
a
state
to
sacrifice
a
part
of
the
immunity
which
the
absence
of
would
emasculate--
ms.
devon
orland
--well,
your
honor--
ms.
devon
orland
--your
honor,
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
that
cost
is
just
too
high.
as
the
zealous
advocate
on
behalf
of
all
of
my
clients,
i
have
to
choose
between
the
individual's
right
to
deal
with
the
law
as
it
is
in
the
state
of
georgia,
whether
that's
the
state
of
georgia's
choice
or
not,
but
the
law
in
the
state
of
georgia
at
the
present
time
is
that
there
is
no
right
to
direct
appeal.
so,
as
a
zealous
advocate
on
behalf
of
the
individual
employees,
we
have
a
desire
to
protect
the
individual
employees
from
the
right--
ms.
devon
orland
--georgia
absolutely
can
make
that
decision,
your
honor,
through
its
legislative
process,
and
that's
part
of
the
point.
ms.
devon
orland
because
the
attorney
general
represents
more
than
just
the
state
in
a
lawsuit
such
as
this.
the
individuals
are
also
being
represented
by
the
attorney
general,
and
the
state
should
not
be
required
to
sacrifice
all
or
part
of
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity
so
that
the
attorney
general
can
zealously
advocate--
ms.
devon
orland
--your
honor,
but
the
employees
have
to
take
the
law
as
it
is.
ms.
devon
orland
that's
correct,
and
congress
has
seen
fit
to
allow
for
a
procedural
device
for
state
defendants
or
any
other
defendants
to
take
advantage
of
the
procedures
available
to
them.
but
nowhere
did
congress--
ms.
devon
orland
--first
of
all,
your
honor,
congress
did
not
expressly
state
that
all
defendants
needed
to
agree.
that
is
a
court-created
doctrine,
and
i'm
not
going
to
challenge
the...
that
doctrine.
ms.
devon
orland
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
devon
orland
your
honor,
all
that
is
true.
but
congress
also
contemplated
the
remand
of
certain
claims.
and
the
only
thing
the
state
is
asking
in
this
case
is
for
the
case
to
be
treated
as
if
it
were
originally
filed
in
federal
court,
which
it
is
our
belief
is
the
true
intent
of
the
congressional
removal
statute.
they
didn't
allow
partial
claims
to
be
brought
up,
and
the
reason
they
didn't
allow
for
it
is
because
of
the
court's
potential
exercise
of
supplemental
jurisdiction.
but
in
this
case,
there
can
be
no
exercise
of
supplemental
jurisdiction
simply
because
the
legislature
for
the
state
of
georgia
has
not
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
as
to
the
georgia
tort
claims
act
for
actions
within
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
so,
in
this
case,
by
the
exercise
of
a
procedural
device,
the
attorney
general
would
not
be
only
overriding
the
very
principles
established
in
the
concepts
of
federalism,
but
would
also
be
overriding
the...
the
decisions
of
the
state
legislature
and
the
georgia
constitution.
ms.
devon
orland
your
honor,
i
understand
the
concerns
of
the
court
regarding
the
concept
of
saying
we're
going
to
federal
court,
but
no,
we're
not.
the...
but
the
reality
of
the
removal
statute
is,
is
it
doesn't
allow
for
the
removal
of
some
claims,
and
that's
a
procedural
device
available.
if
there's
a
remedy
to
be
had,
the
remedy
to
be
had
is
with
congress.
if
there's
a
problem
with
the
removal
statute
not
allowing
certain
claims
to
be
brought
in
federal
court
and
therefore
the
whole
case
can't
be
removed--
ms.
devon
orland
--your
honor--
ms.
devon
orland
--then
by
very
virtue
of
a
sham
joinder
of
the
state
in
a
case,
which
in
this
case
arguably
was
done
by
suing
the
case...
state
under
1983
and
further
by
attempting
to
sue
the
state,
for
which
there
has
been
no
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
as
to
defamation
of
liable,
a
plaintiff
can
shamly
decide
that
individuals
won't
be
entitled
to--
ms.
devon
orland
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
problem
here
is,
is
that
by
virtue
of
1983
litigation,
individual
employees
get
sued.
and
it
does
create
sort
of
a
quandary
of
issues
because
the
individuals
have
a
desire,
quite
understandably
i'm
sure,
to
get
the
case
resolved,
to--
ms.
devon
orland
--your
honor,
i
would
agree
it's
absurd,
and
that
type
of
behavior
could
be
sanctioned
by
the
court.
if
a
lawyer
is
going
to
play
those
kinds
of
games,
it
is
certainly
within
the
court...
district
court's
province
to
sanction
ill-behavior.
and
that's
what
is
being
alleged
that
we
did.
but
what
i
would
point
out
is
that
every--
ms.
devon
orland
--your
honor,
if
it--
ms.
devon
orland
--i'm
sorry
if
i
misspoke.
if
a
lawyer
is
going
to
remove
a
case
and
do
it
for
the
purposes
of
delay
or
some
other
misconceived
purpose--
ms.
devon
orland
--and
it's
improper.
ms.
devon
orland
there's
nothing
improper
about
that,
but
in
the
scenario
that
if
it
is
improper,
if
it
is
determined
that
there
is
some
attempt
to
elongate
litigation
for
an
improper
purpose,
the
court
has
the
discretion
to
sanction
that
behavior.
moreover,
congress
has
the
ability
to
change--
ms.
devon
orland
--your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
we
did
anything
improper.
i'm
saying
that
in
the
event
that
somebody
did
do
something
improper,
that's
sanctionable.
ms.
devon
orland
hence,
the
quandary
of
being
a
state
litigator,
your
honor.
and
that's
exactly
the
point.
we
have
several
clients
here.
the...
the
attorney
general's
office
represents
the
individuals
as
well
as
the
state
entity
on
both
state
and
federal
claims.
you're
right.
all
of
the
federal
claims
are
gone.
even
if
you
read
at
joint
appendix
17
the
plaintiff's
assertion
that
he
is
seeking
declaratory
relief,
which
i
would
suggest
is
not
a
clear
statement
of
declaratory
relief...
it
is
a
request
for
declaratory
relief
under
state
law.
so,
if
the
court--
ms.
devon
orland
--well,
your
honor,
in
fact
at
some
point
in
this
litigation
we
did.
but
at
the
initial
point
of
the
removal,
there
was
no
reason
to.
and
i
think
this
goes
to
justice
kennedy's
concurrence
in
wisconsin,
which
is
if
the
state
is
going
to
be
placed
in
some
tactical
disadvantage,
this
rule
should
not
be
adopted.
the
tactical
disadvantage
in
this
case
is
quite
simple.
the
state
would
be
at
odds
with
its
employees.
the
state
would
not
be
in
a
position
where
there
is
no
eleventh
amendment
protection
as
to
some
claims
perhaps...
or
it
hasn't
been
decided
yet
for
ada
title
ii
claims...
to
have
a
federal
court
be
the
first
to
adjudicate
those
types
of
issues
and
have
the
fastest
course
to
this
court
for
a
determination--
ms.
devon
orland
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
devon
orland
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's...
that's
exactly
the
point
here
is...
and
also
the
point
as
to
why
the
attorney
general,
as
the
litigator
on
behalf
of
the
state
and
its
employees,
should
not
be
in
a
position
to
make
a
decision
as
to
waiver.
that's
why
it
goes
to
the
legislature.
ms.
devon
orland
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
devon
orland
your
honor,
the
only
time
that
it
could
waive
sovereign
immunity
is
if
the
state
legislature
says
i
authorize
the
attorney
general--
ms.
devon
orland
--that
is
correct.
ms.
devon
orland
well,
your
honor,
and
that's
exactly
the
point,
is
there
is
no
clear
statement
of
waiver
here
by
congress
or
the
state
legislature.
i
don't
think
you
can
just
pick
and
choose
a
waiver.
ms.
devon
orland
your
honor,
in
all
the
cases
relied
upon
by
the
petitioner
where
the
state
has
come
into
federal
court,
the
court's
first
inquiry
was
whether
the
eleventh
amendment
applied.
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
court
first
found
that
the
eleventh
amendment
simply
was
inapplicable.
when
the
state
is
acting
as
a
plaintiff
or
in
any
form
or
fashion
or
entering
in
as
a
party,
it's
not
a
suit
commenced
or
prosecuted
against
the
state.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
conceded
that
the
act
of
removal
does
not
translate
the
state
from
a
defendant
to
a
plaintiff.
yet,
they
are
asserting
that
the
cases
where
the
state
has
entered
in
as
a
plaintiff
somehow
are
applicable,
and
they
are
not
applicable.
ms.
devon
orland
your
honor,
the
eleventh
amendment
would
just
simply
be
inapplicable
if
the
state
entered
as...
as
a
plaintiff.
ms.
devon
orland
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
baffled.
but
i
think
that
sovereign
immunity--
ms.
devon
orland
--as
was
pointed
out
i
guess
in
alden
is
the
eleventh
amendment
has
stood
for
the
greater
principles
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
i
think
that
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here.
and
i
think
it's
also
been
concretely
held
that
the
eleventh
amendment
in
its
broader
principles
perhaps
doesn't
apply
to
the
state
when
it
enters
into
an
action
as
a
plaintiff.
and
i
think
that
that's
an
entirely
different...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
devon
orland
it's
not
that
the
legislature
hasn't
authorized
the
removal.
it's
that
the
legislature
hasn't
authorized
a
waiver
of
the
state's
immunity.
ms.
devon
orland
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor,
and
i
think--
ms.
devon
orland
--well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
would
say
that
that
is
a
different
situation.
obviously
the
court
knows
that.
but
this
court's
jurisprudence
is
consistent
with
the
state
being
able
to
assert
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity
at
any
time.
the
court
has
not
differed
from
that
jurisprudence.
but
what
i
would
point
out
in
this
case
is
the
state
was
very
up-front
from
the
beginning.
this
wasn't--
ms.
devon
orland
--your
honor,
it
does
but...
and
i
think
that
that
would
be
consistent
with
this
court's
jurisprudence.
but
at
the
same
time,
i
would
suggest
that
the
state
has
a
vested
interest
in
not
going
to
trial
at
all.
so,
i
would
suggest
that
since
ford,
there
probably
haven't
been
a
lot
of
situations
where
the
state
has
been
in
a
position
of
litigating
a
case
to
the
end,
and
it
hasn't
come
up
since
ford.
so,
i
think
that
that's
fairly
significant.
ms.
devon
orland
then
the
eleventh
amendment
simply
doesn't
apply.
ms.
devon
orland
there's
no
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity--
ms.
devon
orland
--there's
no
dipping
into
the
state's
pocket.
the
counterclaim
can
go
as
far
as
the
defense.
this
court
has
repeatedly
found
that
an
entry
into
a
forum
or
the
beginning
of
suit
allows
the
party
being
sued
to
defend
against
the
claim.
but
that's
not
the
same
as
dipping
into
the
state's
pocket.
what
the
petitioner
is
alleging
is
that
somehow
the
bifurcation
of
cases
is
an
unheard
of
result
and
that
it
should
be
exchanged
from
the
state's...
thank
you.
