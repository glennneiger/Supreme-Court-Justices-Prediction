spectators
are
admonished,
do
not
talk
until
you
get
outside
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
bederman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
ford
motor
company
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
think
a
line
can
be
drawn
between
the
state
defendant
being
drawn
in
as
a
respondent
or
involuntarily
as
opposed
to
removing
and
thereby
invoking
federal
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
legal
position
is
basically
that
a
state
should
not
be
able
to
talk
out
of
both
sides
of
its
mouth
i
guess.
it
should
not
be
able
to
remove
and
then
when
it
gets
to
federal
court
claim
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
now,
how
much
of
that
argument
is
still
valid
after
what's
happened
in
this
case
i'm
not
sure.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bederman.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
it's
a
different
case
because
the
state
removed
it
than
it
would
have
been
if
the
same
factual
circumstance
had
occurred
in
the
case
originally
brought
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
state
is
certainly
entitled
to
make
a
tactical
judgment--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
it's
better
off
in
federal
court
than
it
is
in
state
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
ms.
orland,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
the
legislature
didn't
say
that
no
georgia
employee
shall
ever
have
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
any
court.
it
had
just
said
they
don't
happen
in
georgia
courts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
lawyers
do
all
sorts
of
things
for
the
purposes
of
delay.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
it
is.
i
think
in
many
cases
an
attorney
will
look
at
two
different
choices,
particularly
if
you're
a
defendant,
and
you'll
choose
the
thing
that
will
delay
the
case's
final
resolution.
and
nothing
improper
about
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
state
would
be
at
odds
with
its
employees
because
the
employees
want
an
interlocutory
appeal
and
they
can't
get
it
in
the
state
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
that
sort
of
thing
arises
frequently.
do
you
move
for
a
change
of
venue
or
not
in
a
particular
case
where
you've
got
multiple
defendants?
and
as
justice
stevens
said,
perhaps
a
lawyer
ought
not
to
have
multiple
defendants
if
they're
going
to
have
different...
different
approaches
to
the
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
counterclaim
by
the
defendant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
orland.
ms.
parsley,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
isn't
that
an
implied
waiver
too?
brings
suit...
the...
the
state
brings
suit
in
federal
court
is
subject
to
a
counterclaim.
and
you're
saying
that
the
state
is...
is
subject
to
adjudication
of
that
counterclaim.
now,
there's
no
express
waiver
there.
it's
just
an
implied
waiver
from
bringing
the
action
in
federal
court.
why
isn't
removal
the
same?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
speak
of
the
res
of
the
litigation.
supposing
the
state
simply
wants
to
collect
a
bad
debt
from
somebody.
there's
no
res.
maybe
he
doesn't
have
anything
at
all.
but
it
simply
wants
a
money
judgment
against
him
for
$100,000.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
no...
there's
no
res
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
parsley.
mr.
bederman,
you
have
4
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
bederman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-298,
lapides
versus
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
system
of
georgia
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
