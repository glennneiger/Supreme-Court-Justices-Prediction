justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
stop
you
there?
because
you
mentioned
section
1983,
and
that
makes
this
case
terribly
puzzling
because
i
thought
states
were
not
persons.
so,
if
you're
not
subject
to
suit
under
1983--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
the
basis
of...
you're
suing
the
state
and
the
state
is
not
a
person
within
1983.
so,
even
if
you
prevailed
100
percent
on
your
eleventh
amendment
claim
that
you
could
remove
despite
that
sovereign
immunity
claim--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--against
the
state?
i
thought
a
state
was
not
a
person,
period,
under
1983.
a
municipality
is,
a
county
is,
but
a
state
is
not.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
declaratory,
injunctive,
whatever.
they're
not
subject
to
suit
under
1983.
isn't
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
ex
parte
young
is
something
different.
you're
suing
the
officer,
not
the
entity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
that
either.
what's
very
puzzling
here
is
you
wanted
the
case
to
be
in
state
court,
and
then
it
was
removed.
you
moved
to
remand,
didn't
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
now
you're
getting
just
what
you
want.
you're
getting
the
remand
and
you
don't
want
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
been
no
kind
of
adjudication
on
the
merits
against
the
state...
against
the
state
entity
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
seems
to
be
a
purely
academic
question
not
in
this
case
because
the
qualified
immunity
question,
as
i
understand
it,
was
decided
against
the
individual
officers.
so,
what
federal
question...
this
goes
back
to
what
justice
breyer
asked.
i
don't
see
any
federal
question
left
in
this
entire
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
at
least
the
footnote
that
was
read
didn't
make
any
distinction
based
on
declaratory
judgment.
it
said
a
state
is
not
a
person
for
1983
purposes.
period.
that's
what
that
footnote
said.
you're
telling
me
now
that
i
was
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you're
not
right
about
1983,
assume
now
that
a
state
is
not
a
person
for
purposes
of
1983.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
what
federal
element...
what
federal
question
is
left
in
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
with
all
the
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence
in
the
world,
it
would
make
sense
for
any
district
judge
to
hang
onto
a
case
that
at
the
threshold
had
all
the
federal
elements
taken
out
of
it
and
has
nothing
but
state
claims
left.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
how
that...
how
your
client
is
in
any
way
harmed
by
any
of
this
because
he
ends
up
with
what
he
wanted
is
his
suit
in
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
the
end
result
you're
getting.
you're
getting
a
remand
and
you
want
to
have
a
different
label
put
on
it.
but
the
bottom
line
is
you
wanted
a
suit
in
state
court.
that
was
removed.
there...
there's
no
federal
element
left.
i
can't
imagine
a
district
judge
who
would
hang
onto
such
a
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gornstein,
may
i
deflect
you?
because
i
got
from
your
brief
the
notion
that
this
case
is
academic,
and
let
me
read
you
from
page
23,
note
8.
the
question
whether
a
state
that
removes
a
case
waives
its
immunity
to
constitutional
claims
is
largely
academic.
section
1983
does
not
authorize
a
suit
against
a
state
in
either
state
or
federal
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
were
telling
us
in
that
footnote
that
whatever
is
said
about
the
removal,
this
case
goes
because
the
state
is
not
subject
to
1983.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
a
district
judge
be
acting
reasonably
to
hold
onto
a
case
that
has
no
federal
claim
that
involves
the
state
tort
claims
act,
that
those
are...
the
state
claims
are
under
the
state's
own
tort
claims
act,
like
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
can
you...
could
a
federal
judge
justify
sitting
to
adjudicate
a
case
against
a
state
under
the
state's
tort
claims
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
always
my
understanding
that
the
district
court
would
take
into
account
how
far
have
we
gotten
into
the
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--from
the
federal--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
you
drop
here,
the
federal
issue
drops
out
at
the
very
threshold.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the...
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
to
the
individuals
was
granted
on
the
grounds
of
qualified
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
the
difference
between
a
claim
against
the
state
itself
and
the
claim
against
the
state
officer
in
his
or
her
official
capacity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
mr.
lapides
wants...
mr.
lapides,
as
i
understand
it,
wants
a
money
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
missing
one
very
key
thing
here.
congress
said
in
order
to
remove,
all
defendants
must
remove.
those
officers
could
not
have
been...
could
not
have
removed
on
their
own.
they
had
to
have
the
state's
consent.
and
for
the
state,
after
consenting,
to
say,
oh,
we're
going
to
accommodate
you,
we'll
join
in
the
removal,
but
as
soon
as
we
get
there,
we're
going
to
come
out,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
just
the
clearest
end
run
around
congress'
direction
that
all
defendants
have
to
join
in
the
removal
petition.
it
would
be
a
sham
removal
if
someone
were
to
say,
okay,
i
agree
to
remove
and
be
in
the
federal
court,
but
the
minute
i
get
to
federal
court,
i'm
going
to
say,
federal
court,
you
can't
get
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
court
interpretation
of
the
removal
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
you're
not
going
to
challenge
that.
so,
it's
as
good
as
if
it
were
in
the
statute,
just
as
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine,
although
it's
not
in
the
eleventh
amendment,
is
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
orland,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
obvious
thing
that
the
zealous
representative
of
the
state
would
say
is,
sorry,
we
can't
join
in
the
removal
petition.
this
case
belongs
in
state
court
and
we're
not
going
to
engage
in
any
subterfuge.
we...
it's
just
as
though
it
were
brought
originally.
it
would
be
no
good.
so,
we
are
not
going
to
go
through
the
sham
of
signing
our
name
onto
a
removal
petition
only
to
say
that
this
case
can't
be
brought
in
federal
court.
if
the
state
were
zealous
in
its
position
that
only
the
state
court
can
adjudicate
this,
it
had
no
business
signing
on
to
any
removal
petition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
statute.
it
says
all
defendants
have
to
join
in
the
removal,
and
the
removal
has
to
be...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
of
georgia
really
is
playing
rather
fast
and
loose
with
the...
with
the
federal
court
when
it
says,
aha,
we're
going
to
bring
this
to
accommodate...
to
accommodate
two
people
who
couldn't
do
it
on
their
own.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems
to
me
that
the
case
on
georgia's
own
theory
is
non-removable
from
day
one,
and
that's
the
position
that
georgia
should
have
taken.
this
is
not
a
case
for
a
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
wanted
to
be
in
the
state
court.
it's
the
state
that
said
federal
court.
so,
you
can't...
this...
that's
why
this
case
is
so
puzzling
because
it's
the
plaintiff
who
wants
to
be
in
the
federal
court...
in
the
state
court.
and...
and
the
state
wants
to
take
it
into
the
federal
court.
it
really
is
something
that
only
a
lawyer
could
conceive.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems
to
me
everything
that
you've
said
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
a
non-removable
case
from
day
one
and
that
the
state
should
not
have...
should
not
have
joined
that
removal
petition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
get...
i
don't
get
it
all.
if
the
state
is
immune
from
suit
in
the
federal
court,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
follows
it
has
no
authority
to
remove
the
case
to
the
federal
court.
it
can't
initiate
action.
it
can't
say,
federal
court,
hear
this
case,
and
then
say,
federal
court,
you
don't
have
power
to
hear
it.
it
seems
the
two
go
together.
if
the
federal...
if
the
state
is
not
amenable
to
suit
in
federal
court,
the
state
is
not
positioned
to
remove
the
case
to
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
barred...
the
statute
of
limitations
is
a
defense.
you're
saying
that
the...
the
state
has
not
consented
to
suit.
as
long
as
it
doesn't
consent
to
suit
in
federal
court,
it
seems
to
me
it's
in
a
non-removable
position
in
the
state
court
because
either
it's
going
to
consent
or
it's
not
going
to
consent.
if
it
doesn't
consent,
it...
it
doesn't
have
any
authority
to
remove.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
do
you
think
is
at
stake
now?
on
the...
i
think
that
you
did...
you
did
bring
up
the
question
of
1983
liability,
that
there...
that
this
was
not
a
federal
case
to
begin
with.
is
that...
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
arguing
over
an
academic
question
because
no
matter
what,
this
case
is
going
to
return
to
the
georgia
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
all
those
could
be
very
interesting
questions.
the
bottom
line,
no
matter
how
you
look
at
this
case,
is
it
goes
back
to
the
state
court.
so,
if...
you...
you
had
said
initially
no
1983
liability.
right?
and
that
the
federal
court
should--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
i
had
thought
that
in
the
recent
case
we
had
said
if
you
have
that
picture,
the
federal
court
is
supposed
to
deal
with
the
1983.
wasn't
it
vermont
agency?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
any...
any
way
you
look
at
this,
the
case
ends
up
in...
in
the
state
court.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
really
are
arguing
an
academic
question.
