mr.
david
j.
bederman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
state
affirmatively
invokes
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
by
removing
a
case,
that
acts
as
a
waiver
of
the
state's
forum
immunity
to
federal
jurisdiction
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
this
principle
has
been
confirmed
as
recently
as
this
court's
decision
in
the
college
savings
bank
case
where
it
was
indicated
that
a
state
may
waive
eleventh
amendment
immunity
by
invoking
federal
court
jurisdiction.
this
rule
also
finds
support
in
a
long
line
of
decisions
holding
that
where
a
state
enters
a
federal
proceeding
as
an
actor
in
any
role,
that
effectively
relinquishes
any
objections
to
federal
jurisdiction
a
state
may
have
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
yes,
justice
scalia.
this
court's
precedents
seem
to
indicate
that
wherever
the
state
is
cast
in
the
role
of
plaintiff,
defendant,
intervenor,
or
claimant,
that
the
entry
into
the
federal
proceeding
submits
the
state
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
well,
of
course,
the
authorization
requirement
in
ford
motor...
and
that's
the
particular
holding
in
ford
motor
that
i
think
is
of
concern
to
this
court...
need
not
be
reached
here
because,
of
course,
ford
motor
did
not
involve
a
case
where
a
state
was
actually
invoking
federal
court
jurisdiction.
so--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--yes,
chief
justice.
i
think
the
key
element
here
is
precisely
the
invocation
of
federal
court
jurisdiction.
and
again,
this...
that's
consistent
with
this
court's
rulings
in...
in
gardner
and
in...
and
in
gunter
and
clark
where
it's
made
clear
that
where
the
state
actually
is
invoking
federal
court
jurisdiction,
the
proper
inquiry
is
not
the
authority
of
the
state
officer
or
attorney
to
waive
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
the
proper
inquiry
is
whether
the
state
officer
or
attorney
had
the
power
to
engage
in
the
litigation
conduct
leading
to
the
invocation
of
federal
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
if
i
may
make
a
number
of
responses
to
your
question,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
i
believe
this
court's
holdings
particularly
in...
in
richardson,
in
gunter
do
present
a
situation
where...
where
a
state
is
entering
the
proceeding
and...
in
the
role
of
a
defendant
and
later
decides
to
regret
that...
that
casting
and
tries
to
extricate
itself
from
the
proceeding.
so,
i
think
there
is
authority
in
this
court's
precedents
to
that
extent.
to
your
more
general
observation
in
terms
of
the
harm
here,
in
essence,
weighing
the
plaintiff's
interest
in
a
single
and
unitary
proceeding
in
state
court,
a
result
which
has
been
the...
this
court's
jurisprudence
construing
28
u.s.c.
1441(c)
for
almost
a
century
that...
that
the
removal
statute
does
not
entitle
defendants
to
remove
and
then
split
up
claims--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--well,
justice
breyer,
again
with
respect
i
think
the...
the
proper
analysis
i
think
closely
analyzing
the
state's
professed
interests
in
removing
and
claiming
immunity
was,
first
of
all,
to
engage
the
expertise
of
federal
tribunals
on
questions
arising
under
section
1983
and
qualified
immunity.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
that...
that's--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--justice
ginsburg,
i...
i
would
remind
the
court
that,
of
course,
there
was
relief
pled
for
declaratory
relief
in
the
complaint,
and
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
following
from
will,
a
declaratory
relief
claim
is
properly
pled
in
this
kind
of
proceeding.
of
course,
will
says--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--no,
justice
ginsburg.
under
i
believe
the
footnote
in...
in
will
and
also
in
the
following
case,
arizona's
official
english
case,
it
made
clear
that
that
interpretation
of
section
1983
of
a
person
for
purposes
of
suit
was
for
money
damages
and
that
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
in
order
to
keep
the
symmetry,
presumably
with
ex
parte
young,
as
i
believe
this
court
indicated,
was...
was
a
permissible
pleading--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--that's
right,
but
recall
that
not
only
are
the
regions
being
sued
here
but
also
individuals
in
their
official
capacity
and
as
well
as
in...
in
their
individual
capacity.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
well,
again,
my
response
to
that
would
be
plaintiffs
do
have
an
interest
in
seeing...
in
filing
a
single,
unitary
action
in
state
court,
as
was
properly
done
here.
and
what
the
state
of
georgia
has
attempted
to
accomplish
via
its
removal
and
claiming
immunity
tactic
is...
is
to
break
the...
break
the
plaintiff's
claim
into
discrete
parts
and
dispose
of
them.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
that's
correct.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
well,
it's...
it's
the
remand
apparently
with
the...
the
other
consequences
of
the
federal
court
decisions
to
date.
that's,
of
course,
unfortunately
one
of
the
consequences
of
litigating
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is
that
this
was
taken
as
an
interlocutory
appeal,
and
other
proceedings
of
course
have
occurred
since
then.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
no.
you
are
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
to
date,
there
have
only
been
rulings
by
the
district
court
as
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
qualified
immunity
defense
as
against
the...
the
private--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--i...
i
do
not
know,
justice
scalia.
in
terms
of...
in
terms
of
what
i
understand
is
the
briefing
and
argument,
the
state
of
georgia
did
raise
the
will
defense
in
its
papers.
the
district
court
chose
to
proceed
with
the
case
on
another
ground,
dismissing
the
section
1983
claims
against
the
private
parties
in
their
individual
capacities
on
qualified
immunity.
maybe
there
was
some
concern
about
the
status
of
the
board
of
regents,
but...
but
i'm
as
mystified,
frankly,
as
you
are
about
that
disposition.
again,
if
i
may
repeat,
the
concern
that
petitioner
ultimately
has
about
the
use
of
removal
and
claims
of
immunity
in
this
context
is
it
splits
claims
which
seems
to
be
a
result
that's
specifically
prohibited
by
the
removal
statute
and
this
court--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--if...
if
you're
not
taking
well
my
point
about
the
availability
of
declaratory
relief--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--i
would
never
presume
such,
justice
ginsburg.
[laughter]
i...
i
think
maybe
the
safest
result...
of
course,
this
has
not
been
briefed...
is
whether
this
court's
judgment
in
will
and
subsequently
in
arizonans
for
an
official
english
reaches
this
precise
issue
that
i'm
speaking
to.
no
lower
court
has
addressed
professor
lapides'
request
for
declaratory
relief.
no
briefing
has
been
accomplished
on
that,
and
there's
been
no--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--yes.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
there
would
be
none
left.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
certainly
after
these
proceedings,
that
might
be
the
result
that
a
district
court
judge
in
the
exercise
of...
of
its
discretion
may
wish
to...
to
achieve.
our
concern
is
precisely
the
one
that
when
georgia
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
for
removal,
it
should
have
been
with
the
understanding
that
all
claims
would
move
to
federal
court,
that
the
state
could
raise
whatever
defenses
it
wished
to,
in
other
words,
the
defenses
travel
to
federal
court.
but
what
is
not
a
permissible
result
is,
in
essence,
the...
the
splitting
of
claims,
the
disposition
to
federal
court
and
then--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--well,
if
i
may
make
a
broader
point.
the
eleventh
circuit's
judgment,
from
which
appeal
is
sought
here,
is
not
entirely
clear
about
this
distinction
between
barred
and
non-barred
claims.
that
was
not,
of
course,
settled
in
any
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court
as
to
whether
now
the
state
claims
would
proceed
by
remand
back
to
state
court.
of
course,
the
state
of
georgia
sought
the
dismissal
of
the
entirety
of
professor
lapides'
case
under
rule
12(b)(6)
when
it
removed
the
case.
so,
it's...
it's
now...
not
entirely
clear
at
the
outset
what
georgia's
intentions
were
in
removing
the
case
and
then
seeking
immunity.
our
proposition
is
simply
that,
as
a
matter
of
not
only
judicial
efficiency
but
also
the
integrity
of
the
removal
statute
and
the
fair
meaning
and
understanding
of
this
court's
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence,
is
that
when
a
state
invokes
federal
court
jurisdiction
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
the
entire
case
then
moves
to
federal
court
and
that
the
state
cannot,
thereafter,
claim
immunity
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
in
those
circumstances.
if
the
state
does
not
have
the
authority...
and
this
was
an
earlier
question...
under
ford
motor
company
to
waive
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity
via
removal,
the
proper
course
should
have
been
in
this
case
simply
for...
to
find
the
removal
was
void
ab
initio
and
have
the
entire
matter
remanded--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--well,
again,
i
would
not
presume
to
anticipate
the
future
proceedings
and
that
may--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--well,
i
think
even
though
petitioner
is,
understandably,
reluctant
to
introduce
an
idiom
of
judicial
estoppel
into
these
proceedings
with...
with
obviously
the
clear
indication
that
rules
of
estoppel
tend
not
to
run
against
the
sovereign,
but
again
that
is
precisely
our
concern.
in
the
matter
of...
of
the...
the
symmetry
and
parity
that
occurs
that
when
a
state
enters
a
federal
proceeding,
it
submits
the
entire
case
to
the...
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
well,
if
i
may
review
quickly.
yes.
and
i
do
recall
that
the
state
did
raise
in
its
op
cert
at
page
10
the
argument
under
will.
i...
yes.
they
do
opine
that
will
would...
would
act
against
the...
the
claims
raised
for
monetary
relief
by
petitioners
here.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
i
would
not
want
to
put
that
gloss
on...
on
the
states.
i'm
reading
just
an
isolated
passage
on
page
10
of
their
op
cert.
that...
that
is,
in
essence,
the...
the
open
question.
if
i
could
return,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
to
your...
to
your
observation.
again,
while
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
rule
on
any
judicial
estoppel
principles,
clearly
this
is
an
appropriate
case
to
draw
a
bright
line
rule
in
terms
of
states
invoking
federal
court
jurisdiction.
either
they
have
the
authority
to
do
so
and
waive
eleventh
amendment
immunity
and
the
entire
case
proceeds
to
federal
court
or
the
state
officials
or
lawyers
do
not
have
that
authority
and
the
proper
disposition
is
remand.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
if
i
may,
justice
ginsburg,
i
was
not
entirely
as
helpful
as
i
could
have
been
in
response
to
your
earlier
lines
of
questioning.
if
i
can
be
of
assistance
to
the
court.
professor
lapides,
in
his
complaint,
alleged
declaratory
grounds
and
declaratory
relief
at...
at
pages...
joint
appendix
pages
17
and
19.
and
a
review
of
the
district
court's
first
order
at
petition
appendix
27a,
while
admittedly
the...
the
holding
is
not
entirely
crystal
clear,
in
terms
of
reserving
the
claims
against
individuals
in
their
personal
capacity,
although
no
mention
is
made
of
the
nature
of
the
relief,
the
cases
cited
by
the
district
court
maybe
are
indicative
that
in
the
district
court's
mind
was
the
open
question
of
the
availability
of
declaratory
relief.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
yes,
sir,
i
am.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
well,
i
think,
of
course,
all
paragraphs
in
a
complaint
need
to
be
read
together
in
view
of
the
earlier
allegations,
in
view
of
this
course
of
conduct
interfering
with
professor
lapides'
constitutionally
granted
due
process
rights
at
both
paragraphs
1
and
at
paragraph
8
of
the
complaint.
i
think
when
read
together,
paragraph
26
fairly
raises
in
terms
of--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--no.
i'm
not
sure
on
the
bare
terms
of
paragraph
26
that
the
request
for
declaratory
relief
is
particularly
tied
to
a
federal
cause
of
action.
all
i
can
point
the
court
to
is
both
paragraphs
1
and
8
of
the
complaint
which
frame
the
federal
question.
if
i
may,
in
terms
of...
of
a
second
point,
about
the
concern
for
tactical
disadvantage
that
the
state
may
be
put
in,
if
the
court
rules
either
that
removal
constitutes
waiver,
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
a
1994
decision
made
clear
that
denials
of
qualified
immunity
defenses
are
subject
to
immediate
certification
for
appeal
by
trial
court
judges.
so,
i
think
it's
extravagant
to
suggest
that
under
georgia
law
currently
that
there
is
no
effective
mechanism
for
the
review,
immediate
review,
of...
of
denials
of
qualified
immunity
defenses.
and
this
is
more
fully
explained
at
reply
brief
page
11
filed
by
the
petitioner.
if
i
may
make
one
last
point,
and
that
is
by
no
means
is
petitioner
asserting
that
by
virtue
of
removal,
plaintiffs
become
defendants
and
defendants
become
plaintiffs.
instead,
our
submission
is
simply
that
removal
is
a
forum
selection,
that
when
the
state
engages
in
that
forum
selection,
it
is
waiving,
for
purposes
of
the
case
and
the
authority
of
the
federal
courts
to
adjudicate,
the
state's
forum
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
if
there
are
no
other--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--it
does...
neither
paragraph
1
nor
8
specifically
refers
to
declaratory
relief.
if
you...
if
you
flip
to
the
prayer
for
relief
at
pages
18
and
19,
of
course,
most
of
it
is
for...
for
monetary
damages.
but,
of
course,
the
last
prayer
is
for
all
relief
that
the
court
may
deem
just
and
proper.
