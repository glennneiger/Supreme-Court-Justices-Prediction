ms.
julie
c.
parsley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
and
consent
to
suit
traditionally
rests
with
the
state's
legislature,
a
body
uniquely
able
to
both
balance
challenges
to
the
public
fisc
and
determine
when
such
a
waiver
is
both
in
the
citizens'
will
and
the
public
good.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
no,
your
honor,
the
court
has
not.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
no,
your
honor.
our
position
would
be
that
as
to
the...
the
specific
compulsory
counterclaim
that
may
be
litigated
against
the
state
as
a
plaintiff,
that
is
permissible
to
the
extent
of
the
res.
in
other
words,
when
the
state
comes
in
as
a
plaintiff--
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
--the
res,
the
subject
matter
of
the
litigation.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
he
does
have
the
authority
to
represent
the
state,
and
presumably
he
has
the
authority
also
by
the
legislature
to
bring
the
cause
of
action
that
he
is
asserting
with
the
state
as
a
plaintiff.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
but
the
two
are
specifically
different
because,
as
a
defendant,
you're
looking
at
this...
it
would
be
an
implied
waiver
as
opposed
to
an
express
waiver.
as
a
plaintiff,
even
the
united
states,
it
has
been
admitted,
they
are
not...
they
are
also
subject
to
waiver
for
compulsory
counterclaims
to
the
extent
of
the
res.
it
has
been--
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
--well,
that
is
the
situation
that
occurred
in
gardner,
your
honor,
for
the...
for
the
proof
of
claim
instance
with
bankruptcy
litigation.
and
that
is...
so,
it
is
not...
and
it's
not
been
seen
as
an
implied
waiver
because
the
state
has
put
in
issue
the
res
and
the
subject
matter
of
the
litigation.
but
in
this
case--
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
--yes,
your
honor.
that
would
be...
then
the
state
would
be
able--
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
--but
it
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
litigation;
that
is,
his...
that
would
be
what
the
state
would
be
adjudicating.
in
this
instant,
what
distinguishes
it
is
that
the
state
is
not
transformed
from
a
defendant
to
a
plaintiff
when
it
removes
to
federal
court,
and
the
literal
text
of
the
eleventh
amendment
proscribes
cases
prosecuted
against
a
state.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
the
texas
supreme
court
has
held
that
sovereign
immunity
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
that
actually,
to
my
knowledge,
has
not
happened
yet.
that
case
was
decided
only
a
couple
of
years
ago.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
no.
we...
we
would
not
assert
that
we
have
waived--
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
--we
would
hope
the
judge
would
agree
with
us.
but
that...
and
that
is.
you
put
your
finger
on
the
point
that
some...
that
people
dislike
about
sovereign
immunity.
it
does
give
the
state
superior
rights
in
some
instances
to
other
litigants,
but
that
is
because
the
state
is
a
sovereign,
just
like
the
u.s.
is
a
sovereign.
the
immunity--
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
--well--
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
--and
all...
all
we
are
really
asking
for,
justice
scalia,
is
to
have
the
same
defenses
that
would
be
available
to
us
if
the
plaintiff
had
chosen
to
file
the
lawsuit
in
federal
court.
we
are
just
employing
a
procedural
device
to
bring
us
into
federal
court
so
that
we
can
adjudicate
the
claims
of
our
employees
and
that,
if
we
have
defenses,
they
can
be
heard.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
they
could
be.
they...
they
could
be
adjudicated
in
state
court.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
yes,
that
is...
that's
true.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
they
could,
but
in
the
johnson
case,
of
course,
this
court
stated
that
the
state
courts
do
not
have
to
have
a
parallel
system
similar
to
the
federal
courts.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
not...
not
at
all,
justice
kennedy.
not
at
all.
and
we
don't
mean
any
disrespect
in
that
regard.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
actually
that...
we
do
not
agree
with
that
because
there's
no
clear
statement
in
the
removal
statute
indicating
that
the
state
would
have
waived
its
immunity
had
it
removed.
also,
there's
no
section
5
power
on
behalf
of
congress
to
actually
abrogate
the
state's
immunity.
so--
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
--but
that
would
be
similar
to
the...
to
the
argument
they
made
in
schacht
in
that
you
cannot
remove
a
case
with
barred
claims.
the
removal
statute
does
not
prohibit
the
state...
states
from
removing--
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
--well,
it
may
be
a
fine
distinction,
but
consenting
to
the
removal,
we
would
argue
and
is
argued
in
the
briefs,
is
not
the
same
thing
as
consenting
to
waive
our
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
the
only
way
we
could
actually
waive
our
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is
if
we
were
vested
with
that
power
by
the
legislature.
and
texas
is
not,
georgia
is
not.
and
under
ford
motor
company,
that's
the
appropriate
analysis
that
the
court
would
engage
in,
whether
we
were--
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
--i
believe
that...
that
georgia,
when
they
moved...
when
they
answered,
they
both
raised
will
and
the
eleventh
amendment
in
their
answer.
that
is
correct.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
it's
not
academic
on
this...
for
this
point.
this
is
really
a
reinvigoration
of
the
implied
waiver
doctrine
that
the
court
fully
rejected
in
college
savings
bank.
this
is...
the
analogy
is
parallel
to
the
market
participation
theory.
in
the
market...
market
participation
theory,
the
state
was
held
as
having
waived
its
immunity
because
it
voluntarily
engaged
in
an
activity--
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
yes,
vermont
agency.
the
statutory
question.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
that
it
could
be
dealt
with
first,
yes.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
that
is
entirely
possible,
and
the
district
court...
it
would
have
been
well
advised
to
have
done
that,
but
the
district
court
did
not
choose
to
do
that.
instead,
it
ruled
on
the
eleventh
amendment.
ms.
julie
c.
parsley
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
petitioner
is
challenging
the
eleventh
circuit's
judgment,
they
do
want
to
remain
in
federal
court.
and
so,
therefore,
they
are
actually
challenging
the
judgment
and
not
just
the
opinion.
so,
there
is
a
justiciable
question
on
appeal.
i
did
want
to
say
quickly
that
in
relation
to
the
implied
waiver
doctrine,
that
a
state
shouldn't
have
to
choose
between
what
is
an
otherwise
legal
activity,
which
is
removal,
and
the
forfeiture
of
its
immunity.
