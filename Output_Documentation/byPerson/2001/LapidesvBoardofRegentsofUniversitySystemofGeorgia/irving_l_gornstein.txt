mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
four
reasons,
a
state's
removal
of
a
case
to
federal
court
waives
its
forum
immunity,
permitting
adjudication
of
the
claims
against
the
state
in
federal--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--they
are
both
protections
that
are
afforded
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
certainly
a
state
has
both
of
those
rights
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
but
the
question
is
the
state
can
waive
one
without
waiving
the
other,
and
that's
what
it
did
here,
by
selecting
a
forum,
federal
forum,
for
the
adjudication
of
the
claim.
but
in
doing
that,
it
did
not
give
up
the
defenses
that
it
had
in
state
court.
and
one
of
the
defenses
that
it
had
in
state
court,
and
it
would
also
have
in
federal
court,
is
a
right
not
to
be
sued
at
all
on
constitutional
claims.
but
what
it
did
give
up
is
the
right
to
proceed
in
state
court,
rather
than
federal
court,
on
the
claims
that
it
already
has
waived
in
state
court.
now,
the
principle
that
justifies...
the...
the
state's
invocation
of
federal
court
jurisdiction
through
removal
is
a
particularly
clear
example
of
a
state
voluntarily
invoking
federal
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
to
the
extent
that
there
are
constitutional
claims
against
a
state,
that's
correct.
to
the
extent
that
there
are
state
law
claims
against
the
state,
that
is
not
correct
because
the
state
has
waived
its
forum
immunity
with
respect
to
the
state
law
claims--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
ginsburg,
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
exercise
of
the
district
court's
discretion
under
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
grounds.
that...
certainly
if
the
federal...
all
the
federal
claims
were
out
of
the
case,
one
ground
for
remanding
the
rest
of
the
cases
under
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute
would
be
present.
it
would
be
a
matter,
though,
for
the
exercise
of
the
district
court's
discretion.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
right.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
correct,
and
that
would
argue
more
strongly
in
favor
of
the
district
court
exercising
its
discretion
in
that
direction,
assuming
there's
no
other
federal
claim
in
the
case.
and
let
me
just
address
that
briefly
because
it
is
our
understanding
that
a
suit
against
a
state
official
in
his
official
capacity
for
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief
is
not
a
suit
against
the
state
and
it
is
a
suit
against
the
person
under...
under
section
1983.
so,
if
there
is
a
claim...
and
i'm
unsure
of
whether
the
complaint
should
be
read
that
way,
but
if
there
is
a
claim
against
the
individual
defendants
in
their
official
capacities
for
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--only
as
to
the
claims
against
them
in
their
personal
capacities,
not
as...
with
respect
to
the
claims
against
them
in
their
official
capacities.
so,
that
claim,
if
it's...
if
it
was
there
to
start
with,
it's
still
there.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
distinction
that
the
court
drew
was...
is
this...
traces
its
origins
to
ex
parte
young,
that
that
is
a
suit
against
the
officer
in
his
official
capacity.
there's
no
allegation
that
he's
done
anything
in
violation
of
state
law,
and
you're
not
trying
to--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
think
it's...
it's
largely
true
that
he
wants
a
money
judgment,
but
there
is
one
allegation
in
his
complaint
upon
which
he
relies
in
saying
that
he's
also
seeking
declaratory
relief
against
an
individual...
an
individual
officer
in
his
official
capacity.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
would
say...
i
don't
want
to
quibble
too
much
with
the
semantics,
but
i
would
just...
i
would
put
it
this
way.
the
official
is
not
the
state
for
purposes
of--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no,
they
did
not--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--if
it
was
ever
there,
justice
breyer--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it's
still
there.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
again--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it...
it
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
have
the
case
sent
back.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
would
never...
because
it's
a
matter
for
the
district
court--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--and
what
i
would
say--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that
would
be
the
question
whether
there
is
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
the...
i
don't
want
to
argue
that
part
of
the
case
too
much,
but
the
reason
would
be
if
there
are
still
federal
law
claims
against...
1983
games
against
the...
individuals
and
they
arise
out
of
a
common
nucleus
of
operative
facts
with
the
claims
against
the
state,
then
it
would
still
be
fair
to
try
those
claims
in
federal
court
because
the
state
made
a
voluntary
choice
to
bring
this
case
into
federal
court.
it
had
an
option
to
leave
the
entire
suit
in
state
court
if
it
wanted
to.
it
exercised
the
option
to
bring
the
case
into
federal
court.
now,
once
it
did
that,
under
federal
law,
the
federal
consequence
of
that
is
that
a
federal
court
has
authority
to
adjudicate
the
very
claims
that
the
state
has
brought
there.
and
the
principle
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
am,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
under
this
court's
decision
in
pennhurst,
if
a
plaintiff
files
a
suit
in
federal
court
that
includes
both
federal
law
claims
and
state
law
claims,
the
state
law
claims
against
the
state
are...
have
to
be
dismissed
under
pennhurst.
but
the
situation
is
different.
this
plaintiff
did
just
what
the
pennhurst
opinion
suggested
that
he
should
do,
which
is
to
file
his
claims
against
the
state
under
state
law
in
state
court.
and...
and
with
that,
he
added
his
federal
law
claims
so
that
he
could
have
a
single
lawsuit
filed
in
a
single
forum.
now,
what
the
removal
statute
says
is
that
there's
only
can
be
removal
if
there...
you
get
the
consent
of
all
the
parties
to
the
removal
of
the
entire
case.
the
removal
statute
does
not
allow
for
state
court
defendants
to
divide
up
a
single
case
or
controversy
into
two
different
cases
in
two
different
forums.
and
the
state
is
effectively
seeking
to
accomplish
that
goal.
now,
it
says
it
needs
to
do
that
because
it
wants
to
get
the
benefit
of
a
federal
forum
for
its
state
employees.
but
the...
just
because
the
state
has
a
difficult
choice
to
make
about
whether
to
remove
a
case
to
federal
court
or
not
doesn't
mean
its
decision
to
bring
the
case
to
federal
court
isn't
voluntary.
it's
still
a
voluntary
decision
to
bring
the
case
to
federal
court.
it's
also
a
little
surprising
to
hear
the
state
say
that
it
needs
to
have
a
federal
forum
for
its
state
officials
on
federal
law
issues
when
the
state
has
repeatedly
and
successfully
argued
to
this
court
that
state
courts
are
fully
competent
and
just
as
competent
as
federal
courts
to
adjudicate
federal
law
issues.
and
it's...
it's
particularly
surprising
that
the
state
thinks
it's
in
the
state's
interest
for
its
employees
to
get
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
federal
court
when
the
state's
own
policy
is
that
they
aren't
entitled
to
an
interlocutory
appeal.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
certainly
is.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
absolutely
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
all
we
are
saying
is
once
it
does
that,
then
it
has
to
accept
the
consequences
of
that
choice,
which
is
the
federal
court
then
has
authority
to
adjudicate
the
entire
case
that
has
been
brought
before
them...
before
it.
i
wanted
to
say
a
word
about
the...
the
ford
motor
company
case
because
in
the
ford
motor
company
case,
the
court
did
deem
state
law
authority
to
consent
to
be
the
critical
issue.
but
all
other
decisions
in
which
the
court
has
addressed
the
invocation
issue,
the
court
has
held
that
an
individual
when...
i
mean,
when
a
state
invokes
federal
court
jurisdiction,
it
waives
immunity
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
