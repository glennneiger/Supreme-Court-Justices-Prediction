when
you
say
as
an
actor
in
any
role,
does
it
ever
intervene
as
a
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
ask
why
it
proceeded...
let
me
read
you
something
else
from
one...
a
fairly
recent
opinion.
we
have
routinely
addressed,
before
the
question
whether
the
eleventh
amendment
forbids
a
particular
statutory
cause
of
action
to
be
asserted
against
states,
the
question
whether
the
statute
itself
permits
the
cause
of
action
it
creates
to
be
asserted
against
states.
why
didn't
the
lower
courts
follow
that
procedure
and...
and
decide
the
1983
substantive
issue
of
whether
the
state
is
liable
first?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not...
it's...
i
mean,
the
concept
has
been
around.
i
mean,
we've...
we've
held
that
a
state
does
not...
just
because
a
state
is
willing
to
be
sued
in
its
own
courts
does
not
automatically
mean
that
it
can
therefore
be
sued
in
federal
court.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
which...
which
means
that...
that
you
can
be
immune
in
one
forum
and
not
immune
in
another
forum,
although
you're
not
immune
from
the
suit
entirely.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's...
you
know,
that's
too
bad,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
cost
of
getting
the
advantage
of
federal
courts
is
that
you...
you
come
into
federal
court.
it
seems
to
me
self-evident.
now,
you
say
i
have
a
good
reason
for
wanting
to
be
in
federal
court.
well,
you
may
indeed.
but
there
you
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
you're
asking
for
a
broader
principle,
which
it
may
well
be
that
in...
in
its
application
to
your
case
there's
some...
you
can
understand
why
the...
why
the
state
wanted
to
go
into
federal
court.
but
what
you're
asking
for
is
the
general
principle
that
by
coming
into
federal
court,
you
do
not
waive
state
sovereign
immunity,
and
that
general
principle
would
have
applied
even
if
you
had
been
the
only
defendant
in
the
state
court.
and
you
removed
to
federal
court,
and
then
having
gotten
into
federal
court,
you
moved
to
dismiss
on
grounds
of
sovereign
immunity,
which
is
absurd.
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
it
would
be
improper
not
to
take
advantage
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
should
be
sanctioned
as
incompetent
counsel.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
on
your
theory,
even
if
the
state
had
come
in
as
a
plaintiff
in
the
first
place,
you
would
have
sovereign
immunity,
wouldn't
you?
because
the
legislature
hasn't
waived
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
orland,
what
if...
what
if
your...
your
state
attorney
general
brings
suit
in
federal
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
he
has
no
authority
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
you
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
we
inquired,
when
states
bring
a
suit
in
federal
court,
whether
the
state
attorney
general
has
authority
to
appear?
because,
you
know,
when
you
come
in
federal
court
and
you're
subject
to
a
counterclaim.
have
we...
have
we
asked
district
judges
to
inquire
whether
the
state
attorney
general
has
authority
to
waive
sovereign
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
not.
and...
and
is
it
your
position
that
as
soon
as
a
counterclaim
is
filed,
what?
the
whole
suit
has
to
be
dismissed
or...
or
what...
what
happens
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
say
the
attorney
general,
even
though
he
has
no
power
to
waive
state
sovereign
immunity,
can
achieve
a
waiver
of
state
sovereign
immunity
by
bringing
suit
which
is
subject
to
a
compulsory
counterclaim.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
the
same
here
when...
when
he
doesn't
have
authority
to
waive
sovereign
immunity,
but
he
has
authority
to
remove
to
federal
court.
and
if
that
results
in
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
so
be
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't...
i
don't
object
to
that.
i
object
to...
to
a
dog
in
the
manger,
i
mean,
to
say
one
thing
and
then
say
another
thing.
and
here's
the
state
saying
i
want
to
be
in
federal
court
and...
and
gets
there
and
the
state
says,
i
don't
want
to
be
in
federal
court.
i
mean,
that...
that's
what
i
object
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
have
all
the
sovereign
immunity
you
want.
just...
you
know,
just
decide
whether
you
want
it
or
don't
want
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
fact,
you
prefer
your
interpretation
of
federal
law,
don't
you?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
talking
about
paragraph
26
of
the
complaint?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
just
says,
i
want
a
judicial
finding
that
what
kansas
did
amounts
to
defamation.
i
take
it
that's
a
defamation
claim
under
state
law.
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it?
