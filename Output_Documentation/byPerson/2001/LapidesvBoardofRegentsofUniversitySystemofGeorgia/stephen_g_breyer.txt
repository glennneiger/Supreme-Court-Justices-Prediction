justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
all...
in
all
those
cases,
they
were
cases
in
which
a
state
really
consented
to
have
litigated
against
it
a
federal
claim
in
a
federal
court.
and
it's
hardly
surprising,
once
you
agree
to
that,
that
you
also
are
agreeing
to
have
related
things
litigated
against
you.
but
this
isn't
that.
this
is
a
case
where
the
only
reason
that
the
state
went
into
the
federal
court
was
so
that
the
individual
defendants
would
be
able
to
invoke
their
right
to
have
the
matter
heard
in
a
federal
court.
so,
why
isn't
the
obvious
solution
here...
there
are
only
state
claims
left
against
the
state
which
doesn't
want
these
heard
in
the
federal
court.
they
haven't
agreed
to
have
anything
heard
there
against
them.
so,
judge,
send
it
back
to
the
state
court.
what's
it
doing
here?
they
don't
want
it
here.
call
that
pendent
jurisdiction,
pendent
claims,
but
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion,
at
least,
not
to
send
it
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
that's
exactly...
what
if
it's
that?
the
interest
of
the
plaintiff
in
having
the
action
against
the
individuals
in
the
state
tried
in
one
place,
on
the
one
hand,
against
the
interest
of
the
state
having
a
state
matter
tried
in
state
court
where
the
state
has
refused
to
waive
its
immunity
from
federal
jurisdiction.
that
for
me
is
easy.
one
is
a
constitutional
right;
the
other
happens
to
be
a
right
of
a
plaintiff
that
he
wouldn't
have
anyway
if
he
had
brought
his
suit
in
federal
court,
which
is
what
removal
jurisdiction
is
about.
so,
why
doesn't
the
state
clearly
prevail
on
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
but
justice
ginsburg
i
think
has
said
the
individuals
are
out
of
it.
qualified
immunity.
we're
left
with
the
state.
she
wrote
for
the
court
in
arizona
official
english...
she
says,
the
barrier
was
not,
as
the
ninth
circuit
supposed,
eleventh
amendment
immunity
which
the
state
could
waive.
the
stopper
was
that
1983
creates
no
remedy
against
a
state.
now,
that's
what
the
court
held.
so,
1983
creates
no
remedy
against
a
state.
so,
you
have
no
federal
claim
against
the
state,
and
your
other
federal
claims
are
disposed
of.
so,
we're
left
with
a
purely
state
matter
in
the
state
court...
in
the
federal
court,
and
the
state
says,
remand
this,
send
it
back.
now,
why
shouldn't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
that's
like
suing
the
state.
in...
in
other
words,
there
is
a
claim.
under...
under
1983.
a
state
is
a
person
when
you
ask...
say
i
want
an
injunction.
the
state
is
a
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
that's
a
different
matter.
so,
what
you're
saying
is
there
is
an
action
against
the
official.
that's
not
the
issue
because
they
dismissed
all
the
claims
against
the
officials.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh.
so,
there's
still
an
action
left
against
the
officials.
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
okay,
i
got
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
that's
so,
how
could
it
not
be
an
abuse
of
discretion?
assuming
if
that's
even
there,
how
could
it
not
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
refuse
to
send
this
back
to
the
state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
purely
state
matter.
and...
and
i'm
not,
you
know,
overwhelmingly
far
out
i
think
in
this
area,
but
i
don't
really
see
why...
why
the
state
here
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
have
it
sent
back
on
the
ground
it
would--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--be
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
under
certain
circumstances.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
a
general
rule.
my
goodness.
suppose
the
state
comes
in
and
they
have
four
claims
and
they...
they
wanted...
they
say,
oh,
i
have
a
great
idea.
i'm
going
to
get
this
claim
litigated
over
here
in
the
federal
court
and
there
are
three
related
claims.
it's
a
bankruptcy
matter,
for
example,
and
they
just
pick
and
choose.
i
mean,
normally
when...
when
you
have
waiver
in
constitutional
law,
say
the
fifth
amendment,
you...
you
start
waiving
answers
to
one
question
and
related
questions
are
going
to
be
waived
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
i
mean,
but
justice
stevens'
question
is
that
you're
arguing
for
a
general
principle
that...
that
they
don't
waive
anything.
is
that
right?
they...
they
come
into
federal
court.
why
did
they
do
it?
they
came
into
federal
court
in
all
these
others
because
there
was
a
claim
they
wanted
litigated
either
for
them
or
against
the
state.
so,
i
would
have
thought
they
would
at
least
have
waived
all
related
matters.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
you
were
claiming
sovereign
immunity.
i
mean,
it...
i
mean,
sovereign
immunity
today
is
something
broader
than
the
strict
terms
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
i
thought
you
were
making
the...
the
full
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
have
had
that
problem
too
in
some
of
the
prior
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i...
i
haven't
agreed
with
them,
but
i...
i
have
to
accept
what
they
are.
and...
and
the...
the
principle
of
sovereign
immunity
is
a
principle
today
that
is
not
limited
by
the...
by
the
strict
terms
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i...
i
want
to
ask
you
a...
a
kind
of
question
which
is
subsumed...
a
narrower
question
which
is
subsumed
within
the
broader
one,
and
that
is
let's...
let's
put
this
situation
aside
and
assume
that
we
have
the...
the
conflict-free
situation
in
which
the
employees
have
their
own
counsel
and
the...
the
state
is...
is
represented
simply
by...
by
separate
counsel.
the
employees
want
to
remove
and
the
state,
as...
as
a
defendant
separately
represented,
agrees
to
the
removal.
on
your
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
the
state
would
still
be
able
at
a
later
time
to
claim
its
immunity
because
the
legislature
had
not
authorized
that
removal.
is
that
correct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and...
and
so,
in...
in
that
particular
case
that
i...
i
posed
to
you
in
which
we
have
separately
represented
defendants,
the
state
consents
to
the
removal.
the
state
still
would
not
have
lost
its
immunity
by
consenting
to
the
removal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
in
that
situation
then,
how
do
you
answer
the
argument
that
came
up
in
the
briefs
that
that
would
give
the...
the
state
the
opportunity
to
sit
back
and
see
how
things
go?
and
if
the...
if
the
case
turns
out
well
for
them,
they
can
claim
the...
the
judgment.
if
the
state
doesn't
go
well
for
them,
they
can
simply
raise
the
question
of
immunity
not
only
to
escape
the
judgment,
but
to
escape
any
estoppel
later
on.
i
mean,
is...
is
there
any
answer
to
that,
or
do
you
simply
say,
yup,
that's
a
great
position
to
be
in
and
that's
our
position?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
this
situation.
i'm
talking
about
where
your
position
leads
us.
and
i
take
it
that
your
position
does
lead
us
to
the...
to
the
sort
of
the
options
that...
that
i've
just
described.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
under
state
law,
say,
in
texas
if...
it's
a
tort
action.
it's
against
the
state.
everybody
in
your
office
thinks
that
there
is
no
sovereign
immunity,
but
just
before
the
jury
is
about
to
come
in,
somebody
dredges
up
a
statute
and
says,
oh,
my
god,
we
had
sovereign
immunity.
we
forgot
to
make
the
defense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
other
words,
you
can
come
in
in
texas,
a
jury
is
about
to
come
in,
you're
just
about
to
lose
the
case,
the
last
minute
you
discover
this
defense,
and
just
they'll...
they'll
dismiss
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
wouldn't
say
you
had
waived
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
wouldn't
assert
that.
i
just
wonder
what
the
judge
in
texas--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
read
them
together.
i
just
read
it.
what
he
says
is
i
want
a
judicial
finding
that
kansas
state
action
gives
rise
to
a
new...
is
defamatory,
thereby
giving
rise
to
a
new
cause
of
action
every
time
the
information
is
published.
okay?
read
it
together
so
it
states
a
federal
claim.
i'm
not
saying
you
can't.
i
just
want
to
hear
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
mean
to
pursue
a
red
horse.
i
just
don't
want
to
miss
something
if
it's
there.
where
in
paragraph
1
or
8
does
it
ask
for
a
declaration?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
eleventh
amendment
as
it
has
been
interpreted
provides
a
state
with
immunity
against
suits
in
the
federal
court
brought
against
the
state
by
a
citizen
of
that
state
or
of
another
state.
but
that
state
can
waive
that
immunity,
it
can
consent
to
sue.
there
is
a
long
line
of
cases
that
indicate
that
the
state
does
consented,
does
waived
that
immunity
when
it
appears
in
the
federal
court
and
that
appearance
is
voluntary.
this
case
focuses
upon
a
citizen
who
initially
sued
a
state
in
the
state
court
on
a
state
law
claim,
in
respect
to
which
the
state
had
waived
immunity
from
suit
in
the
state
court
but
it
had
not
waived
immunity
from
suit
in
the
federal
court.
subsequently,
the
state
defendant
which
was
the
state,
it
was
a
defendant
in
the
state
court,
had
found
--
and
i
am
not
going
to
go
how
it
found
the
special
reasons
which
are
really
irrelevant
--
found
that
it
could
remove
the
case
voluntarily
into
the
federal
court,
and
it
did
so.
the
question
before
us
is
has
the
state
in
voluntarily
removing
the
case
consented
to
the
suit
in
the
federal
court,
thereby
waiving
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
it
did
not
waive
the
immunity
but
we
conclude
to
the
contrary
that
it
did
waive
the
immunity.
our
basic
reasons
are:
first,
taht
we
create
an
anomaly
where
the
state
permitted
to
invoke
federal
court
jurisdiction
to
removal
while
denying
that
the
federal
judicial
power
can
extend
to
the
case
by
asserting
sovereign
immunity.
moreover
that
isn't
just
theoretical
but
all
kinds
of
unfair
results
could
take
place
if
that
were
permitted.
then
we
considered
the
basic
reasons
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
to
the
contrary.
it
found
that
state
law
did
not
permit
the
state
attorney
general
to
waive
the
immunity
by
removal
or
otherwise,
but
in
our
view,
the
matter
is
one
of
federal
law
not
state
law,
and
we
conclude
that
federal
law
does
find
waiver
in
these
circumstances.
we
note
that
it
is
possible
to
read
an
earlier
case
in
this
court
ford
motor
company
versus
department
of
the
treasury
of
indiana
as
suggesting
that
the
lower
court
was
right
but
we
overruled
that
case
in
so
far
as
it
does
so.
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
