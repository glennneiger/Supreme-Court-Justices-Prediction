justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
all
eighth
amendment
claims
under
1983,
which
is
what
most
of
the
prison
cases
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
claim
that
they've
been
deprived
of
a
constitutional
right
because
they
have
been
sentenced
to
prison
and
the
conditions
of
that
prison,
whether
it's
an
isolated
beating
by
a
guard
or
anything
else,
are
unduly...
are
cruel
and
unusual?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
blumenthal,
i
don't
really
understand
this.
was
the
threat
that
the
guards
made,
if
you
tell
somebody
through
an
administrative
internal
procedure
we're
going
to
kill
you,
but
it's
perfectly
okay
to
go
to
a
court
directly.
we
just
really
want
you
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
we'll
kill
you
if
you
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you
go
right
to
the
court,
that's
okay.
is
that
realistically
what
the
threat
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
problem,
you
have
it
no
matter
what,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
would
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
prison
guards
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--administrative
law
generally,
in
my
experience.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
still
in
all,
even
in
hudson,
i
guess,
drawing
a
distinction
between
continuing
prison
conditions
and
single
incident
prison
conditions,
or
single
incidents
that
aren't
prison
conditions,
still
involves
you
in
the
same
problem
of
satellite
litigation
that
you
say
would
be
one
of
the
horrible
effects
of
adopting
the
same
interpretation
in
the
present
case.
i
mean,
that
didn't
stop
us
from
coming
out
that
way
in
hudson.
maybe
it
should
have,
but
it
didn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see
somebody
in
dire
need
of
medical
attention
and
i
sit
there
smiling
cruelly...
please,
get
me
a
doctor.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
call
that
excessive
force?
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
things
you
were
saying,
then,
cruelty,
and
savagery,
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
be
just
as
cruel
and
savage
without
applying
excessive
force,
if
you
do
it
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
in
the
world
would
congress...
you
can
give
us
no
inkling
of
why
congress
would
sit
down
and
say,
whether
there
has
to
be
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
ought
to
depend
upon
what
state
of
mind
the
actor
is
going
to
be
held
to?
why
is
there
any
conceivable
connection
between
those
two
issues,
and
that's
what
you're
saying
they
did,
that
they
left
it
up
to
the
future
law
of
this
court
as
to
what
mens
rea
will
be
required,
and
if
on
the
one
hand
the
mens
rea
is
going
to
be,
you
know,
just
deliberate
indifference,
then
you
have
to
exhaust,
and
if
it's
intentional
cruelty
you
don't
have
to
exhaust.
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
i
believe
that
policy
was
relevant,
would
i
then
be
right
to
think
that
the
isolated
beating
case
is
perhaps
the
strongest
case
where
you
should
require
exhaustion,
for
the
reason
that
the
prison
doesn't
want
such
a
person
on
its
payroll,
and
if
the
prisoner
is
right,
they'll
find
out
about
it
fast
and
get
rid
of
him--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
but
i'll
take
action.
