justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
universe
of
conditions
and
nonconditions
that
you
would
suggest?
there
was
considerable
discussion
in
the
brief
about
the
distinction
between
1983
suits
and
habeas
corpus
suits.
you
would
not
draw
the
line
there,
would
you,
or
would
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can
you
give
me
an
example,
under
your
theory,
of
a
case
that
is
not
covered
by
habeas
corpus,
but
that
also
are
not
a
condition
of
prison
life
which
is
a
1983
suit?
when
could
a
1983
suit
lie
under
your
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can't
think
of
any
suit
brought
by
a
prisoner
that
is
not
controlled
by
the
term,
conditions,
unless
it's
a
habeas
corpus
suit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
an
easier
line.
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
minute
you
begin
defining
a
universe
of
conditions
which
is
smaller
than
the
1983
suits...
generally
we
have
a
whole
jurisprudence
that
has
to
be
tested
and
create
satellite
litigation,
et
cetera,
and
i
understand
that.
i'm
just
wondering
if
your
definition
is
prevailing,
congress
would
have
used
those
words,
conditions.
it
would
have
just
said
all
1983
suits
involving
prisoners,
period.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
acknowledge
they
do
draw
this
distinction
between
prison
conditions
and
excessive
force
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
me
on
your
point
1,
you
cited
the
case
where
excessive
force
applied
to...
prison
conditions
applied
to
a
single
incident.
what
was
that
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
was
that
pre
or
post
enactment
of
the
litigation
reform
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
preenactment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
hudson
and
farmer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
cases
that,
including
the
one
you
cite,
the
government
cites
for
the
opposite
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
cases
say,
and
they
have
loads
of
language
there
which
seem
to
say
it,
that
wilson
v.
seiter
and
three
other
cases
did
focus
on
the
issue
of
single
incident
versus
affecting
several
people.
they
all
decided
that
single
incident
is
within
the
meaning
of
prison
conditions
or
the
like.
senator
biden
on
the
floor
says,
if
you
pass
this
law,
you
are
going
to
sweep
within
it
excessive
force
cases,
and
nobody
denies
it,
all
of
which
from
the
most...
and
the
language,
the
language
admits
of
justice
souter's
suggestion,
and
he
provides
a
purpose.
so
taking
all
those
things
together,
why
isn't
the
law
in
this
case
precisely
along
the
lines
he
suggested?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
only
excessive
force?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
now,
i
didn't
realize
this.
you're
conceding,
i
take
it,
that
an
individual
incident
is
a
prison
condition,
as
long
as
it
isn't
an
excessive
force
incident,
and
at
that
point,
although
maybe
there
are
three
cases
that
say
this...
i'll
read
them...
why
would
anybody
want
to
say
that
a
single
incident
refusing
to
feed
a
prisoner,
a
single
incident
refusing
to
give
him
medical
assistance,
a
single
incident
refusing
to
let
him
take
exercise
in
fact
is
a
prison
condition,
but
a
single
incident
of
hitting
him
is
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
we're
also
talking
about
reaching
a
sensible
result.
