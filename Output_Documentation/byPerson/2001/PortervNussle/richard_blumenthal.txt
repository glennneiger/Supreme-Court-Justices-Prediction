mr.
richard
blumenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
meaning
of
the
term,
prison
conditions,
and
the
reason
it
is
here
is
because
the
second
circuit
misinterpreted
that
term
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
congress
and
the
meaning
given
that
term
by
this
court.
in
fact,
congress
adopted
this
court's
language
when
it
passed
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
of
1996
and
adopted
the
meaning
of
that
term
given
to
it
by
this
court
in
a
line
of
cases,
preiser
v.
rodriguez,
the
bronson
case,
mccarthy
v.
bronson,
and
wilson
v.
seiter,
that
very
clearly
include
single
episode
and
excessive
force
cases,
which
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
excluded
in
its
decision.
it
interpreted
the
term,
prison
conditions,
to
exclude
those
kinds
of
single
episode
and
excessive
forces
instances
of
misconduct
by
prison
officials.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
preiser
v.
rodriguez
draws
the
line
between
habeas
corpus
petitions
on
the
one
hand
challenging
the
fact
or
duration
of
confinement
and
the
on
the
other
hand
conditions
of
prison
life,
or
conditions
of
his
prison
life,
as
it
refers
to
the
petitions
that
we
think
are
the
universe
that
would
be
included
in
1983
actions.
virtually
any
conditions
of
prison
life
ought
to
be
regarded
as
conditions
of
confinement
cases.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
our
position
would
be
that
all
of
those
183
lawsuits
ought
to
be
subject,
are
subject
to
the
exhaustion
requirement.
there
are
no
exclusions,
whether
it's--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--well,
if
it
were
completely
unrelated
to
prison
life...
an
example
might
be,
for
example,
a
lawsuit
against
a
state
tax
commissioner,
for
example,
just
to
take
one
that
seems
relevant
in
light
of
the
earlier
argument
today,
where
the
prisoner
is
claiming
that
he's
been
denied
a
refund
to
which
he's
properly
entitled,
and--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--all--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--yes,
justice
scalia.
all
eighth
amendment
constitutional
claims,
indeed
all
constitutional
claims
under
1983,
this
court
has
never
established
a
hierarchy
among
such
claims
regarding
excessive
force
claims
as
deserving
greater
priority,
so
that
they
ought
to
be
spared
the
exhaustion
requirement.
in
fact,
it
is
specifically
said
in
wilson
v.
garcia
that,
for
example,
on
statute
of
limitations
questions
there
ought
to
be
uniformity,
and
certainty,
so
as
to
avoid
the
kind
of
litigation
that
also
was
the
purpose
of
congress
in
passing
the
plra,
and
that
is
really
one
of
the
key
points
here.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
justice
kennedy,
congress
used
that
term
because
it
was
used
by
this
court
to
describe
a
category
of
the
universe
as
set
forth
in
preiser
and
again
in
mccarthy
v.
bronson,
where
the
court
faced
a
similar
issue
under
the
magistrates
act,
the
nonconsensual
referral
of
petitions
to
magistrates,
and
said
that
all
of
these
cases,
1983
cases
are,
indeed,
conditions
of
confinement
cases,
and
congress
wanted
to
use
that
language
and
that
meaning
given
by
this
term
so
as
to
avoid
corollary
or,
as
you
put
it
quite
well,
satellite
litigation
that,
in
fact...
in
fact
has
been
spawned
in
the
second
circuit
by
the
nussle
case,
and
we
see
it,
for
example,
in
royster
v.
united
states,
which
is
before
this
court
on
cert,
where
excessive
force
is
no
longer
even
involved.
it's
a
particularized
instance,
as
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
it,
of
denial
of
the
documents,
legal
documents
that
the
prisoner
claims
he
is
entitled
to
receive,
and
courts
then
and
now
would
have
to
decide
what
kinds
of
cases
are
excessive
force,
if
they
are
mixed
with
other
cases
that
may
not
be
excessive
force,
if
they
seem
to
involve
in
some
respect
ongoing
conditions--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--exactly,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
ought
to
be
required
to
exhaust
because
in
that
case,
for
example,
the
prison
administrator
could
and
might
well
make
adjustments
to
the
facilities,
might
do
retraining,
different
decisions
on
hiring,
in
fact,
disciplining--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--certainly
in
connecticut's
system,
justice
ginsburg,
there
are
such
assurances,
and
in
the
joint
appendix
at
11
and
at
other
places
there
are
requirements
for
confidentiality,
for
example.
there
is
a
requirement
for
an
informal
contact
or
request.
in
the
connecticut
system,
the
commissioner
entertains,
personally
reads,
is
on
the
floor
and,
indeed,
there
is
the
requirement
that
the
lieutenant
make
two
rounds
every
day,
that
a
captain
make
one
round,
that
he
be
or
she
be
accessible
in
those
circumstances,
and
that
protection
be
provided,
and
that
is,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
advantages
of
exhausting,
because
it
assures
timely,
prompt
attention.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
justice
scalia,
the--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--the
threat
of
retaliation
was
more
general.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
and
it
was
never
verified,
of
course.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
it
was
a
claim.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
well,
they're
learning,
justice
scalia,
and
part
of
the
claim
here
was
one
of
retaliation,
but
it--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--he
was
in
prison
when
he
brought
this
lawsuit.
he
waited
for
3
years.
he
waited
until
literally
3
to
5
days,
depending
on
whether
you
look
at
the
complaint
or
whatever,
until
the
statute
of
limitations
was
about
to
expire,
and
then
he
went
to
court.
it
was
not
a
timely,
emergent,
exigent
plea
for
help,
and
if
there
had
been
a
real
threat
physically
to
him,
the
prison
administration
would
have
afforded
a
far
more
effective
means
of
protection
than
going
to
federal
court
and
seeking
some
remedy...
and
by
the
way,
he
sought
money
damages.
he
didn't
seek
any
protection
or
injunctive
relief...
than
going
to
federal
court
and
seeking
some
remedy
far
in
the
future.
the
excessive
force
claim...
and
i
want
to
be
very
frank
about
it...
is
intertwined
with
the
single
episode
contention
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
also
relied,
and
in
our
view
the
excessive
force
claim,
the
threat
of
physical
harm,
is
a
more
difficult
one
because
it's
raised
in
this
court's
cases,
in
hudson
v.
mcmillian,
and
farmer
v.
brennan,
which
deal
with
the
element
of
proof,
the
elements
of
proof
that
have
to
be
provided
to
make
out
a
claim,
with
the
standard
of
intent
that
has
to
be
shown.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
they
do,
justice
kennedy,
but
only
for
the
purpose
of
the
standard
of
proof
or
intent,
and
this
court
has
made
that
distinction
very
clear
in
crawford-el
v.
britton,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
at
523
u.s.
574,
and
particularly
at
585
the
court
draws
the
distinction,
because
in
crawford-el
it
is
saying
that
a
heightened
standard
of
intent
need
not
be
shown,
should
not
be
required
in
order
to
protect
prison
officials
from
frivolous
lawsuits
or
from
discovery.
and
the
court
says
we
have
a
law
that
will
do
that,
we
have
the
plra,
and
it
says
about
the
plra,
most
significantly,
and
i'm
quoting
from
585,
most
significantly
the
statute
draws
no
distinction
between
constitutional
claims
that
require
proof
of
an
improper
motive
and
those
that
do
not,
so
the
court
there...
and
it
goes
on
to
say,
if
there
is
a
compelling
need
to
frame
new
rules
of
law
based
on
such
a
distinction,
presumably
congress
either
would
have
dealt
with
the
problem
in
the
reform
act,
or
will
respond
to
it
in
future
legislation.
what
the
court
is
doing
there
is
saying,
and
it
does
so
after
a
footnote
that
cites
farmer,
and
refers
to
the
eighth
amendment,
that
is
to
say,
footnote
7,
we
don't
mean
that
prison
conditions
should
exclude
the
excessive
force
claims
simply
because
we
have
said
in
farmer
and
hudson
v.
mcmillian
that
under
the
questions
presented
there
they
would
do
so,
so
the
court
i
think
as
answer...
this
court
has
answered
that
question,
and--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--crawford-el
is
523
united
states
574,
and
i
have
been
quoting
from
585.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
and
597.
the
quote
was
from
597,
but
i
want
to
make
clear,
in
fairness,
that
quotation
is
not
central
to
the
holding
of
the
case,
which
i
mentioned
earlier.
it
is
a
distinction
that
the
court
draws
so
as
to
in
effect
provide
reassurance
that
the
prisoner
litigation
reform
act
will
do
the
job
of
eliminating
frivolous
litigation
as,
indeed,
it
did
in
1997a(c),
where
it
provided
for
dismissal
of
actions
that
are
frivolous,
malicious,
or
seek
monetary
damage
from
an
official
who
is
immune,
and
it
uses
the
term,
prison
conditions.
in
fact,
prison
conditions
is
also
a
term
used
in
1997e(f),
where
there's
a
reference
to
the
pretrial
proceedings
that
can
occur
by
means
of
video,
or
telephone,
or
other
telephone
communications
technology.
there
is
no
reason
that
the
term,
prison
conditions,
in
those
sections
of
the
statute,
ought
to
exclude
excessive
force
cases
or
single
episode
instances
of
misconduct
and,
indeed,
it
would
do
violence,
it
would
be
directly
contradictory
to
the
purposes
of
congress,
which
were
to
reduce
the
volume
of
litigation,
particularly
frivolous
litigation,
to
give
prison
administrators
a
chance
to
correct
errors
or
mistakes
and
to
reduce
the
interference
of
federal
courts
in
prison
administration,
and
to
provide
a
better
record
if
there
is
going
to
be
resort
to
the
federal
courts.
with
the
court's
permission,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
not
completely
out
of
ideas.
a
few
brief
ones:
first,
to
expand,
perhaps,
on
the
point
raised
by
justice
breyer,
i
can't
speak
for
all
the
state
prison
systems
throughout
the
united
states,
but
a
prison
guard
who
did
what
mr.
nussle
claimed
he
or
they
did
would
be
transferred,
disciplined,
perhaps
fired
by
this
commissioner.
i
am
certain
of
that
fact,
because
we
have
assisted
in
that
process.
indeed,
some
of
those
guards
have
been
criminally
investigated,
not
guards
involving
this
incident,
but
some
who
have
committed
the
kinds
of
acts
that
mr.
nussle
might
complain
of.
there
are
speedy,
effective
administrative
remedies
that
can
be
applied
to
protect
prisoners,
and
it
is
in
the
interests,
may
i
respectfully
suggest,
of
the
state
to
do
so
to
eliminate
or
at
least
reduce
prison
unrest,
to
make
sure
that
it
isn't
held
liable
in
more
serious
incidents,
if
they
are
bad
guards.
the
administrators
of
modern
prison
systems
have
a
very
powerful
and
compelling
self-interest
in
using
the
grievance
system
as
a
management
tool.
now,
that
may
not
have
been
on
congress'
mind.
congress
undoubtedly
was
concerned,
as
the
legislative
history
clearly
shows,
with
the
fact
that
there
were
40,000
of
these
lawsuits
pending,
prisoner
petitions,
constituting
one-quarter
of
the
entire
federal
case
load.
congress
wanted
to
streamline
the
system
and
force
all
of
these
prison
petitions
to
go
through
the
exhaustion
process,
and
there
is
no
evidence,
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
or
elsewhere
it
intended
to
carve
out
or
make
an
exception
for
single
incident
excessive
force
cases
and,
indeed,
the
evidence
is
all
to
the
contrary.
mccarthy
v.
bronson
was
a
single
incident,
single
episode
of
excessive
force,
but
this
court
said
that
it
was
included
in
the
term,
conditions
of
confinement,
for
purposes
of
the
magistrate
referral
act.
that
is
the
term
that
congress
understood
it
to
be.
crawford-el
confirms
at
597,
where
i
quoted
it.
it's
in
our
view
conclusive
on
this
point,
but
we
would
submit
that
the
interests
of
the
statute
are
best
served,
congress'
purposes
are
best
served.
the
distinction
that
is
suggested
by
the
respondents
is
unsupported
in
principle
and
unworkable
in
practice
for
many
of
the
same
reasons
that
this
court
said
in
wilson
v.
seiter
that
the
single
incident
versus
continuing
practice
distinction
was
simply
illogical
and
impractical.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
