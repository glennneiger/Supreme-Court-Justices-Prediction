justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
blumenthal,
on
the
other
side
of
that
is
the
argument
that
nussle
makes
that
he
said
that
the
guards
told
me
if
i
report
what
they
did
they
would
kill
me,
so
are
there
assurances...
you
said
the
value
of...
no
risk
to
the
prisoners,
this
is
going
on,
so
that
they
can
cure
it.
he
says,
if
i
told
they
said
they
were
going
to
kill
me.
are
there
assurances
in
the
system
that
there
isn't
going
to
be
retaliation
of
someone
who
makes
an
internal
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
he
still
in
prison
when
he
brought
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
williams,
there's
a
case
that
has
come
up
in
various
forms
where
violence,
random
violence
is
what
characterizes
the
prison
system.
there
was
the
litigation
in
alabama,
where
the
state
attorney
general
said,
this,
the
atmosphere
in
this
prison
is
jungle-like,
and
this
court
said
it
in
dosset
v.
rawlinson.
where
do
you
put
those
cases?
those
are
excessive
force
cases,
but
it's
pervasive
in
the
prison,
not
just
one
beating
by
a
guard.
would
those
cases
come
outside
the
prison
litigation
reform
act,
even
though
you're
talking
about
the
kind
of
conduct
that
pervades
the
entire
institution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
hard
to
say
it's
deliberate
indifference
when
you're
beating
up
on
someone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
warden
knows
that
this
is
going
on.
it's
not
deliberate
indifference,
because
it's
a
jungle-like
atmosphere.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
would
think
that
just
the
usage,
ordinary
english,
what
the
words
mean,
when
a
condition
pervades
a
prison,
then
it's
a
prison
condition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here
the
prisoner
suits,
it
happens
to
be
the
caption
for
the
provision.
they
use
in
the
text
prison
conditions
but
the
caption
is
prison
suits,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
we
do
with
a
case
where
the
prisoner
said,
these
guards
are
beating
up
on
me,
and
the
reason
they
are
is
that
this
prison
doesn't
give
guards
any
training,
doesn't
supervise
them,
so
my
1983
suit
is
against
the
guards
that
beat
me
up,
but
they're
also
against
the
officials
in
the
prison
who
are
responsible
for
training
and
for
monitoring?
those
have
to
go
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
prisoners
who
claim
denial
of
their
federal
rights
while
incarcerated
and
their
obligation
to
exhaust
prison
grievance
procedures
before
seeking
relief
in
court.
ronald
nussle,
an
inmate
in
connecticut
prison,
brought
directly
to
court
without
filing
an
inmate
grievance
a
complaint
charging
that
corrections
officers
singled
him
out
for
a
severe
beating
in
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
stand
on
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
nussle
bypassed
the
grievance
procedure
despite
a
provision
of
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
requiring
inmates
to
exhaust
administratively
all
claims
with
respect
to
prison
conditions
before
filing
suit.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
agreed
with
nussle
that
the
act
exhaustion
provision
did
not
apply
to
his
complaint.
the
provision’s
key
words
"prison
condition"
the
court
held
cover
only
complaints
about
conditions
affecting
prisoners
generally
not
complaints
about
single-incident.
nussle
defends
the
second
circuit's
judgment
but
urges
that
the
relevant
distinction
is
between
excessive
force
claims
which
he
says
need
not
be
pursued
administratively
in
all
other
claims
which
he
recognizes
must
proceed
first
to
the
prison
grievance
process.
we
reject
both
readings
and
reverse
to
second
circuit
judgment.
our
decisional
guides
are
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
text
and
context
and
our
prior
opinions
interpreting
similar
statutory
language.
the
pathmarking
case
is
mccarthy
against
bronson.
the
statute
we
interpreted
in
that
case
authorizes
district
judges
to
refer
to
magistrate
judges
prisoner
petitions,
challenging
conditions
of
confinement.
the
petitioning
prisoner
in
mccarthy
argued
that
the
provision
governing
referrals
to
magistrate
judges
covered
claims
about
ongoing
prison
conditions
not
complaints
like
his
that
homed
in
on
an
isolated
incident
of
excessive
force.
finding
nothing
to
suggest
that
congress
meant
to
divide
prisoner's
petition
to
this
subcategories,
we
rejected
the
prisoner's
argument.
the
phrase
“prisoner
petitions
challenging
conditions
of
confinement",
we
held
in
mccarthy,
applies
broadly
to
all
claims
about
occurrences
or
circumstances
in
prison
including
complaints
targeting
general
conditions
as
well
as
complaints
about
isolated
incident
of
excessive
force.
mccarthy
was
a
1991
decision;
congress
enacted
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
in
1995.
our
normal
presumption
is
that
congress
expects
its
statutes
to
be
read
in
line
with
our
precedent.
that
presumption
the
prison
litigation
reform
act's
dominant
concern
to
promote
administrative
redress,
to
filter
out
groundless
claims,
and
to
foster
better
prepared
litigational
claims
that
are
aired
in
court
persuade
us
that
the
exhaustion
provision’s
key
word
"prison
conditions"
are
properly
read
through
mccarthy’s
lens.
we
are
fortified
in
reading
the
statute
as
we
do
by
this
overriding
consideration.
scant
sense
supports
the
second
circuit's
single
occurrence
prevailing
circumstances
dichotomy.
why
should
a
prisoner
have
immediate
access
to
court
when
a
guard
assaults
him
on
one
occasion,
as
the
second
circuit
held,
but
not
when
beatings
are
widespread
or
routine.
the
distinction
nussle
urges
between
excessive
force
claims
on
the
one
hand
and
all
other
suits
arising
in
prison
on
the
other
presents
a
similar
anomaly.
do
prison
authorities
have
an
interest
in
receiving
prompt
notice
of,
and
an
opportunity
to
take
action
against
guard
brutality
that
is
somehow
less
urgent
than
their
interest
in
receiving
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
stop
other
types
of
staff
wrongdoing?
isn't
that
answer
plainly
no?
in
sum,
we
hold
that
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
exhaustion
requirement
applies
to
all
inmate
suits
about
prison
life
whether
they
involve
general
circumstances
or
particular
episodes
and
whether
they
allege
excessive
force
or
some
other
wrong.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
