we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
00-853,
porter
v.
nussle.
general
blumenthal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
certainly
find
some
eighth
amendment
claims
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
excessive
force,
i
think.
a
case
comes
to
mind
that
we
decided
earlier
this
term,
a
case
called
molesco,
which
came
from
the
second
circuit.
it
didn't
come
here
under
the
prison
litigation
act,
but
what
happened
there
was
that
the
prisoner
had
a
heart
condition,
he
ordinarily
was
allowed
to
use
the
elevator
to
go
up
to
the
sixth
floor
cell,
this
day
the
prison
attendant
said
no,
you
can't
use
the
elevator,
so
he
walked
up
the
stairs
and
had
a
heart
attack.
now,
that
case
was
brought
under
the
eighth
amendment.
i
take
it
under
your
view
that
if
it
were
a
prison
litigation
action
he
should
have
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
chief
justice

h.
rehnquist
is
this
the
citation
to
crawford-el?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
blumenthal.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
williams.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
at
issue
in
wilson
v.
seiter?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
so
far
as
you're
concerned
would
be
a
number
of
single
incident
types
of
thing
that
did
not
involve
excessive
force?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
would
congress
have
made
that
distinction
and
said
that
one...
the
kind
of
cases
you're
refer...
shouldn't
exhaust
administrative
remedies
whereas
the
other
one
should.
it
doesn't...
i
can
see...
you
can
certainly
draw
a
definitional
line,
but
why
would
congress
have
said
case
a
exhaust,
case
b
don't?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
really
isn't
quite
that
clear
what
congress
wanted
to
do
as
between
these
two
views.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
have
a
guard
who
is
sadistically
beating
people,
certainly
that
seems
to
be
the
sort
of
thing
that
might
easily
be
corrected,
at
least
for
the
future,
by
exhaustion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is,
but
when
we're
trying
to
figure
out
what
congress
really
intended
here,
i
think
one
shies
away
from
a
distinction
which
is
perfectly
technically
sound
but
doesn't
seem
to
have
anything
to
do
with
what
people
thinking
about
the
desirability
of
exhaustion
would
have
thought
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
a
prison
guard
who
maliciously
beats
up
on
people
is
just
there
to
stay,
so
to
speak?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
would.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
out
of
time,
but
you're
welcome
to
sit
down.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
williams.
mr.
blumenthal,
you
have
4
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
blumenthal.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
no.
00-853
porter
against
nussle
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
