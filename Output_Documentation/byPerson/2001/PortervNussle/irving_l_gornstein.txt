mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
four
reasons,
actions
that
challenge
particular
instances
of
unlawful
conduct
such
as
excessive
force
are
actions
with
respect
to
prison
conditions
that
must
be
exhausted
under
the
plra.
first,
in
three
cases,
this
court
has
used
the
terms,
prison
conditions,
or
conditions
of
confinement,
to
refer
to
particular
instances
of
unlawful
conduct
and,
in
one
of
those
cases,
mccrary
v.
bronson,
it
applied
the
term
to
a
single
episode
of
excessive
force.
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
intended
any
narrower
meaning
here.
second,
the
purposes
of
the
exhaustion
provision
are
to
give
prison
officials
an
opportunity
to
resolve
problems
within
the
prison
by
themselves,
and
to
reduce
the
enormous
volume
of
prison
litigation
in
federal
courts.
in
terms
of
those
two
purposes,
there's
absolutely
no
reason
to
distinguish
between
actions
that
challenge
particular
instances
of
unlawful
conduct
such
as
excessive
force
and
any
other
sort
of
prisoner
complaint.
prison
authorities
in
fact
have
a
particularly
strong
interest
in
resolving
complaints
about
staff
misconduct
on
their
own,
and
grievance
procedures
are
fully
effective
to
do
that
without
any
need
for
significant
federal
court
litigation.
third,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
administer
a
line
between
isolated
episodes
or
particular
instances
and
more
systematic
practices,
or
actions
undertaken
pursuant
to
a
policy.
any
effort
to
do
that
would
generate
substantial
additional
litigation
on
a
threshold
collateral
issue
when
congress'
goal
was
to
reduce
the
amount
of
judicial
resources
devoted
to
prisoner
complaints.
and
finally,
creating
an
exception
for
particular
instances
of
unlawful
conduct
has
the
potential
to
create
an
enormous
loophole
in
the
exhaustion
requirement.
already,
that
exception
has
been
applied
by
the
second
circuit
to
retaliation
claims,
to
confiscation
of
property
claims,
and
it
has
the
potential
and
capability
to
be
applied
to
a
wide
variety
of
prisoner
complaints
that
are
directed
at
the
actions
of
individual
officers.
it
is
very
unlikely
that
the
congress
amended
this
exhaustion
provision
for
the
express
purpose
of
making
sure
that
a
dramatically
increased
number
of
cases
would
have
to
go
through
the
exhaustion
process,
would
have
simultaneously
cut
out
that
large
category
of
claims
that
could
benefit
from
the
exhaustion
process.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mccrary
v.
bronson.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
preenactment.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
in
that
case
was
a
construction
of
the
magistrates
act
that
had
nonconsensual
referral
in
cases
involving
conditions
of
confinement,
and
the
court
interpreted
the
phrase,
conditions
of
confinement,
to
embrace
single
incidents,
including
excessive
force,
and
rejected
an
alternative
construction
that
is
similar
to
the
one
adopted
by
the
second
circuit
here
that
prison
conditions
refers
to
systematic
practices,
and
it
did
so
for
the
same
reasons,
really,
that
you
should
reach
the
same
conclusion
here.
the
court
said
that
the
purpose
of
that
act
was
to
reduce
the
workload
of
federal
courts,
and
that
would
further
that
purpose,
and
it
said
that
trying
to
draw
that
distinction
between
individual
actions
and
systematic
practices
would
provoke...
generate
a
whole
new
round
of
litigation,
when
what
we're
trying
to
deal
with
here
is
something
that's
trying
to
save
time.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
hudson
and
farmer
show
that
the
term,
prison
conditions,
can
be
used
in
a
narrower
sense,
and
that
context
matters,
but
here
the
context
was
in
defining
the
substantive
elements
for
proving
a
particular
kind
of
eighth
amendment
violation,
and
the
substantive
standards
for
proving
a
claim
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
whether
a
claim
should
be
exhausted.
the
context
we
have
here
is
an
exhaustion
provision,
and
the
purposes
of
exhaustion,
as
i
have
said,
are
to
give
prison
officials
a
chance
to
act
first
to
solve
a
problem
and
to
reduce
the
volume
of
litigation
and,
in
light
of
those
purposes,
it
simply
makes
no
sense
to
adopt
a
narrower
meaning.
instead,
the
court
should
adopt
a
broader
meaning
that
comes
from
preiser
v.
rodriguez,
and
mccrary
v.
bronson,
and
wilson
v.
seiter.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
scalia,
two
responses
to
that.
one
is
that
the
line
that
was
actually
drawn
in
hudson
as
i
read
it
is
not
between
single
instances
and
systematic
practices,
it's
between
excessive
force
claims
and
everything
else,
which
is...
does
still
have
its
difficulties
in
administration,
but
maybe
not
quite
as
challenging
as
single
instances
versus
systematic
practices.
the
other
difference
is,
we're
talking
about
applying
something
at
the
liability
stage
to
make
a
determination
on
whether
there
has
been
liability
enough,
as
opposed
to,
what
do
we
do
right
at
the
outset
of
litigation
when
somebody
comes
in
with
a
complaint,
it's
a
threshold
question,
and
generating
additional
litigation
about
that
on
a
threshold
question
on
a
collateral
issue
it
seems
to
me
is
something
that
you
would
want
to
generate
less
litigation
about,
generally
speaking.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
