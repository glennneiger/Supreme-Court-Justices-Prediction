justice
david

souter
isn't
the
answer
to
your
argument,
though,
the
answer
that
mr.
gornstein
gave
a
moment
ago
when
he
referred
to
the
significance
of
context?
if
the
issue
before
the
court
involves
a
distinction
among
different
kinds
of
prison
cases,
then
we
can
certainly
understand
the
distinction
when
we
say
conditions
are
different
from
particular
incidents,
and
if
you
refer
only
conditions,
you're
meaning
to
exclude
particular
incidents.
but
if
we're
trying
to
draw
a
distinction
between
prison
cases
and
all
kinds
of...
all
other
kinds
of
1983
cases,
which
was
the
case
when
congress
passed
this
statute,
then
i
suppose
it
does
make
good
sense
to
use
prison
conditions
in
a
much
broader
sense
to
cover
everything
that
might
come
out
of
prison
litigation
to
distinguish
it
from
other
kinds
of
1983
cases,
and
isn't
that
the
answer
to
your
argument
based
on
our
use
of
the
term
in
certain
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
i
mean,
mr.
gornstein's
argument
is
kind
of
a
compared-to-what
argument.
he's
saying,
when
you
use
the
phrase,
conditions,
what
are
you
comparing
the
conditions
against?
are
you
comparing
them
against
other
kinds
of
things
that
happen
in
a
prison,
or
are
you
comparing
them
against
other
kinds
of
cases
that
might
be
brought
under
1983,
and
the
answer
is
possibly
going
to
be
quite
different,
depending
on
which
context
you're
in.
justice

that's
only
excessive
force?
