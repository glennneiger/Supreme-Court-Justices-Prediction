mr.
john
r.
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
when
congress
enacted
the
prison
litigation
reform
act,
it
did
so
on
the
heels
of
at
least
three
decisions
by
this
court
which
clearly
defined
the
term,
prison
conditions,
to
exclude
excessive
force
cases
and
those
cases
start,
of
course,
with
wilson
v.
seiter,
which
expressly
held,
and
i
will
quote,
the
very
high
state
of
mind
prescribed
by
whitley
does
not
apply
to
prison
conditions
cases.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
of
course,
that
was
a
medical
indifference
case,
deliberate
indifference
case
involving
the
distinction
between
a
single
incident
and
multiple
incidents,
and
to
the
extent
that
the
second
circuit,
post
nussle,
has
gone
on
to
attempt
to
draw
a
distinction
of
that
kind,
we
do
not
defend
it.
the
distinction
which
i
think
is
applicable
here
in
defining
the
term,
prison
conditions,
is
excessive
force
cases
versus
all
other
types
of
cases,
other
than--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--yes,
indeed.
i
think
the
distinction
is
one
that
this
court
has
made
it
absolutely
clear
the
distinction
is
between...
has
to
do
with
the
mens
rea
that's
required.
if
the
mens
rea
is
a
malicious,
sadistic,
intending
to
cause
pain,
that's
not
a
prison
condition.
if
it
is,
however,
deliberate
indifference,
that
is
a
prison
condition.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
excessive
force
cases
are
different.
they've
always
been
different
under
this
court's
jurisprudence.
there
are
many
protections
that
are
already
built
in
to
avoid
frivolous
litigation
in
the
excessive
force
context.
for
example,
the
standard
itself,
cruel,
malicious,
sadistic,
is
a
very
tough
one
to
meet.
second,
leatherman,
of
course,
did
not
remove
or
excuse
getting
away
with
just
notice
pleading.
it
required
fact
pleading,
so
that
when
you
combine
the
requirement
of
fact
pleading
with
the
high
standard
that
has
to
be
met
there's
a
very...
it's
a
very
rare
case
that
will
pass
a
12(b)(6)
motion
if
it's
an
excessive
force
case
in
the
first
place.
mr.
john
r.
williams
i
think
that's
more
a
policy
issue
than
a
statutory
construction
issue,
and
i
think
that
this
is
just
a
simple
case
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
i
think
the
context
in
which
this
court
has
used
it,
and
therefore
in
which
congress
is
presumed
to
have
used
it,
is
the
latter.
mr.
john
r.
williams
i
think--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--there's
no
doubt
that
the
cases
involved
do
not
see
a
principal
distinction
between
single
incident
and
multiple
incident
cases.
that,
i
think,
is
where
the
second
circuit
in
the
post
nussle
cases
has
gone
wrong.
i
don't
defend
that.
i
think
that
the
distinction
is
the
one
that
this
court
has
always
drawn,
which
is
between
the
excessive
force
mens
rea,
which
is
cruel,
malicious,
sadistic,
intending
to
cause
pain
and
nothing
else,
on
the
one
hand--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--that
is
exactly--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--that's...
no.
that's
deliberate
indifference.
this
court
has
often
said
that.
that's
exactly
what
we're
talking
about.
mr.
john
r.
williams
there...
it's...
indeed--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--well,
the
term
is--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--the...
we
can
have
words
mean
whatever
we
want
them
to
mean,
but
this
court
has
made
it
clear
what
it
means
when
it
refers
to
excessive
force,
and
that
is
the
mens
rea
that
we
were
just
talking
about
which,
after
all,
comes
from
judge
friendly's
seminal
opinion
in
johnson
v.
glick.
that,
however,
is
not
what
we
mean
when
we
talk
about
prison
conditions,
and
this
court
has
made
that
clear,
and
made
it
clear
at
the
time
congress
enacted
the
plra,
and
i
think
that
the
important
distinction
between
the
plra
and
the
magistrates
act
is
that
when
the
magistrates
act
was
passed,
all
they
had...
and
that's
what
this
court
held
in
mccarthy
v.
bronson,
all
they
had
to
guide
them
on
the
meaning
of
the
term
was
preiser,
and
so
following
preiser,
of
course,
that's
what
it
meant,
and
that's
why
they
used
it
that
way
in
the
magistrates
act.
but
after
this
court
decided
mccarthy
and
brennan,
this
court
then
went
on
to
address
the
issue,
focus
on
the
language,
and
explain
this
very
distinction
that
i'm
arguing
for
here,
and
it
was
after
this
court
had
done
so
in
three
cases,
one
after
the
other,
that
congress
then
passed
the
plra.
mr.
john
r.
williams
i
can't
speak
for
congress'
intention,
but
i
can
speak
for
the
meaning
of
the
words
as
they've
been
defined
by
the
court,
and
there
is
an
obvious
distinction
under
this
court's
cases.
that's
what
we're
talking
about
when
we
talk
about
statutory
construction,
and
that's
why
i
say
that
this
is
not
a
grand
policy
case.
this
is
a
traditional--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--well,
the
sensible
result
is
the
result
that
this
court
has
often
reached
in
the
past,
which
is
to
say
to
congress,
if
this
is
what
you
want
to
do,
do
it
in
the
way
that
you're
supposed
to
do
it.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
of
course,
if
congress
is
ambiguous,
then
we
go
back
to
the
default
position,
and
the
default
position
is,
we
go
back
to
dictionary
meaning,
and
this
court
held
in
mccarthy
v.
bronson
that
if
you
just
look
to
the
dictionary
definition
of
the
term,
prison
conditions,
you're
not
talking
about
excessive
force
cases,
and
in
mccarthy
this
court
said,
however,
we
don't
use
the
dictionary
definition
because
when
the
magistrates
act
was
passed
congress
is
presumed
to
have
been
looking
to
preiser,
but
once
congress
gets
mushy,
as
they
really
are
in
the
plra,
because
some
sections
use
the
term
prison
conditions,
some
sections
don't,
and
that's
even
true
in
the
title
42
amendment,
so--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--i'm
not
sure
that
this
court
has
ever
told
us
exactly
what
the
mens
rea
is
that
must
be
met
in
such
a
case,
and
i
think
that
will
be
the
answer
to
the
question
when
that
case
arises.
if
this
court
says
that
in
any
given
pervasive
violence
situation,
then
the
necessary
mens
rea
remains
the
johnson
v.
glick
one,
then
that's
an
excessive
force
case
and
it's
not
a
prison
conditions
case.
on
the
other
hand,
if
this
court
says
that
the
necessary
mens
rea
is
simply
deliberate
indifference,
then
it
is
a
prison
conditions
case.
mr.
john
r.
williams
if
you're
suing
the
individual
guard,
of
course,
you're
dealing
with
an
instance
of
brutality.
what
i
was
thinking
of
is
the
more
interesting
question
of
where
the
warden
issues
a
decree.
mr.
john
r.
williams
if
the
warden
is
aware
of
it
and
is
tolerating
it,
then
it
becomes
policy,
and
then
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
say,
well,
what's
the
standard
of
liability
for
the
warden?
is
it
deliberate
indifference
or
is
it
the
johnson
v.
glick?
i
don't
know.
i
don't
believe
this
court
has
told
us.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
i
think
that
that
gets
off
into
the
single
incident
versus
multiple
incident
issue,
and
i
prefer
to
think
of
it
in
terms
of
the
mens
rea,
and
i
can
conceive
that
an
argument
might
well
be
made,
and
in
fact
i
would
be
happy
to
make
it,
that
where
it
is
so
pervasive
that
the
warden
is
charged
with
actual
knowledge
of...
there's
the
municipal
liability
cases
under
1983...
that
he's
charged
with
knowledge
of
it,
then
i
would
say
that
the
johnson
v.
glick
standard
applies,
and
it's
not
a
prison
condition,
but
you
could
make
the
other
argument
just
as
well.
in
any
event,
it's
an
easy
line
to
draw
so
that
we
will
know,
the
district
courts
will
know
in
any
given
case
where
it
falls
on
the
line
of--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--i
would
think
that
the
reason
for
that,
if
congress
had
a
reason,
is
that
congress
knew
that
because
of
the
very
high
bar
this
court
has
a
record
in
excessive
force
cases,
combined
with
the
fact
pleading
requirement,
that
the
concerns
congress
had
about
frivolous
litigation
and
undue
meddling
of
the
district
courts
in
their
business
are
already
met
by
existing
law,
and
therefore
the
plra
need
not
be
concerned
with
it
and
indeed,
i
think
just
about
everybody
agrees
that
the
concerns
of
congress
in
enacting
the
plra
was
precisely
those
two
things,
neither
of
which
readily
fits
the
excessive
force
model.
mr.
john
r.
williams
but
that,
again,
is
a
policy
question,
chief
justice.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
when
you
look
at
the
entire
plra,
and
i
was
a
little
dismayed
in
preparing
for
oral
argument
to
realize
that
the
entire
plra
isn't
in
the
joint
appendix
to
our
briefs,
but
when
you
look
at
it
in
its
entirety,
the
presence
or
absence
of
that
phrase,
prison
conditions,
is
quite
interesting.
for
instance,
in
title
42,
prison
conditions
do
not
apply
to
the
attorney
fee
cap.
rather,
that
relates
to
prisoner
suits,
and
similarly
the
distinction
that
there
can
be
no
monetary
award
for
emotional
distress
unless
it's
accompanied
by
physical
injury,
those
are
prisoner
suits,
not
prison
conditions
cases.
when
you
look
further,
section
807,
the
lien
provisions
under
the
act,
again,
there's
no
prison
conditions
limitation,
so
clearly
congress
had
in
mind
that
there
are
some
kinds
of
suits
by
prisoners
where
it
wants
to
impose
more
stringent
limitations
and
others
where
it
wants
to
impose
some
limitations
but
not
the
whole
panoply
of
limitations.
mr.
john
r.
williams
yes,
it
is,
and
then
in
the
context
of
the
section
they
go
on
and
draw
the
distinction.
sometimes
it's
all
prisoner
suits,
sometimes
it's
just
prisoner
suits
about
prison
conditions,
so
i
think
we
really
get
no
place
in
particular
from
the
fact
of
the
caption.
mr.
john
r.
williams
they
go
two
different
directions
and,
of
course,
as
we
know,
that
is
common
place
in
prisoner's
suits,
that
they
have
multiple
counts,
multiple
claims,
and
some
of
them
are
dismissed
early
on,
some
of
them
go
a
little
bit
farther,
and
so
forth.
that
is
the
nature
of
prison
litigation
in
this
particular
case,
the
suit
against
the
guard
for
beating
him
up
would
not
require
exhaustion
and
would
go
forward.
prison
conditions
claims
obviously
would
have
to
be
exhausted,
had
they
not
already
been
exhausted.
mr.
john
r.
williams
no,
actually,
the
difficulties
of
removing
a
civil
servant
who
has--
mr.
john
r.
williams
--when
you
combine
all
of
his
laudermill
rights
with
all
of
his
rights
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
moving
that
guard
or
taking
meaningful
disciplinary
action
against
him
is
not
going
to
be
necessarily
that
fast.
of
course,
what
you
can
do
quickly
is
move
the
prisoner
to
another
unit,
but
then
you
deal
with
what
we
know
to
be
the
reality
of
the
prison
guard
grapevine,
so
that
there's
not
an
easy
solution.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
one
would
hope
not.
mr.
john
r.
williams
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that,
like
all
public
employees,
they
enjoy
a
number
of
due
process
protections
and,
like
most
public
employees,
they
also
enjoy
union
protection.
mr.
john
r.
williams
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
r.
williams
i
agree.
that
is
true.
mr.
john
r.
williams
well,
there's
probably
still
a
pretty
effective
union
contract.
the
guards'
union
is
a
pretty
powerful
force
and,
indeed,
in
this
case
that
was
present.
there
were
the
references
to
the
fact
that
the
guards'
union
was
involved
in
a
big
dispute
with
the
governor
of
connecticut,
who
happened
to
be
a
friend
of
mr.
nussle,
so
that
that
was
present.
the
attempt
by
the
state
to
take
the
title
18
definition
and
move
it
over
to
title
42
i
think
is
equally
unsuccessful.
the
fact
that
it's
in
a
different
part
of
the
code
is
one
reason
why
congress
certainly
wouldn't
have
attempted
to
adopt
it.
indeed,
it's
in
a
part
of
the
code,
title
18,
that
deals
with
different
issues
from
those
which
congress
was
dealing
with
in
its
title
42
amendments.
most
importantly,
of
course,
it
is
explicitly
limited
by
its
terms
to
section
802,
that
is,
title
18,
and
is
not
applicable
elsewhere
and,
as
this
court
held
in
the
vermont
agency
of
national
resources
case,
that
at
least
suggests
that
it
is
inapplicable
to
title
42.
also
of
great
interest,
and
i
think
not
addressed
in
the
briefs,
is
that
section
803
has
its
own
definition
section,
just
as
section
802
does,
but
in
the
section
803
definition
the
term,
prison
conditions,
or
conditions
of
confinement,
is
not
defined,
but
interestingly,
in
section
802
and
in
section
803
there
is
a
definition
of
the
word,
prisoner.
the
words
aren't
precisely
the
same,
but
the
words
appear
to
have
the
same
meaning.
now,
why
would
congress
find
it
necessary
to
define
prisoner
in
section
803
when
they'd
already
done
so
in
802,
unless
it
was
because
they
took
seriously
the
limitation
in
802,
that
the
definitions
there
were
limited
to
section
802?
so
i
think
that
the
attempt
by
the
petitioners
to
borrow
the
section
802
language
and
incorporate
that
into
section
803
simply
won't
work,
and
what
we
are
left
to
fall
back
on
is
the
statutory
construction
arguments
which
i
have
previously
made.
i
hate
to
say
it,
but
i
think
i'm
out
of
time.
thank
you.
mr.
john
r.
williams
out
of
ideas.
