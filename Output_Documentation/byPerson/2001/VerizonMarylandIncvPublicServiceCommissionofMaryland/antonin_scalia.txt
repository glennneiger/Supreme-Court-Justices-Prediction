justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
of
these
agreements,
negotiated
or
otherwise,
are
there
nation-wide?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
idea?
i
mean,
give
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
magnitude.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
just
wondering
how
many
pure
contract
cases
are
being
dumped
into
federal
courts
by
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--100,000?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you
say
every
time
there's
any
dispute
on
this
contract,
even
as
to
what
date
payment
should
be
made,
you
run
into
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
they're
going
there
under
1331?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
how
does
a
state
commission
act
contrary
to
federal
law
in
construing
an
agreement
that
clearly
says
x,
which
is
contrary
to
federal
law,
but
i
mean,
the
state
commission
is
just
saying
what
is
the
truth.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
wouldn't
say
that.
what
do
you
mean,
can
be
construed?
can
be
enforced,
which
provides,
i
mean,
that's
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh...
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
you...
but
sure,
i
mean,
if
you
posit
that
the
federal
regulation
says
no
contract
shall
be
construed
this
way,
no
matter
what
it
says,
no
matter
how
clearly
it
says
that,
then
i
agree
with
you,
the
commission
would
be
violating
federal
law,
but
let's
assume
a
more
normal
fcc
regulation
which
just
says
that
this
particular
disposition
is
unlawful,
even
if
you
do
agree
with
it,
okay,
and
all
that
happens
is
that
the
state
commission
says,
yes,
they're...
that's
what
they
agreed
to,
okay.
now,
how
does
that
violate
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
federal
law,
excuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
5
minutes
or
less.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mcdowell,
regarding
your
earlier
answer
to
justice
souter
as
to
why
congress
would
have
wanted
such
a
crazy,
hybrid
system,
i
mean,
this
piece
of
legislation
was
an
extraordinary
intrusion
of
the
federal
government
into
local
utility
regulation,
wasn't
it?
i
mean,
this
is
an
area
that
has
traditionally
been
regulated
by
the
states.
the
government
has
regulated
interstate
communications,
but
here
they
are
getting
into
local
communication
regulation.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
was
there
not
a
feeling
in
congress
that
we
should
take
as
little
as
possible
away
from
the
states,
if
they
want
to
continue
their
traditional
regulation,
and
if
it
ended
up
in
a
hodge
podge
system,
maybe
many
in
congress
said,
so
be
it.
is
that
not
a
sufficient
explanation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
may
be
a
new
federal
policy,
but
to
regulate
concededly
local
telecommunications
was
a
major
step
for
the
federal
government,
and
maybe
they
didn't
want
to
get
into
the
business
of
doing
that,
which
is
why
they
leave
it
optional
to
the
states
whether
they
want
to
implement
it
or
not.
the
federal
government
didn't
want
to
take
on
these
things,
neither
at
the
fcc
level
nor,
as
far
as
we
know,
at
the
federal
district
court
level.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there's
ftc
participation,
the
state
doesn't
participate
and
there's
an
agreement,
does
that
subsequently
raise
some
issues
of
state
law
interpretation,
of
interpretation
that
can
go
into
state
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
eleventh
amendment
point,
if
we
find
that
there's
a
waiver
under
252,
rather
than
ex
parte
young
as
a
theory,
would
that
simplify
the
question
of
determination
of
state
law
issues?
justice
antonin
scalia
she's
the
first.
she's
the
first
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
verizon
was
objecting
to
a
misinterpretation
of
maryland
contract
law,
but
up
here
they're
saying
that
this
contract
isn't
governed
by
maryland
contract
law,
but
rather
by
federal
contract
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
change
of
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
maryland
contract
law
became
federal
common
law,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
we
have
a
federal
contract
law
that
consists
of
federal
adoption
of
the
common
law
of
each
of
the
50
states
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
understand
it,
i
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
think
the...
would
you
assert
that
the
result
would
be
different
and
you
would
take
a
different
position
if
this
were
not
a
voluntarily
negotiated
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
a
harder
question
for
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
it
can
say
that
before
the
fact
or
after
the
fact?
do
you
think
the
fcc
has
the
power
to
say
that
after
a
contract
has
already
been
voluntarily
negotiated?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
fcc
can
say,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
what
the
parties
agreed
to
voluntarily
is
this,
even
though
it
plainly
is
not
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
the
fcc
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
that
what
has
been
created
is
this
weird
system
in
which
challenges
to
the
interpretation
or
validity
of
negotiated
agreements
can't
go
to
federal
court,
but
if
it's
a
challenge
to
an
arbitrated
agreement,
it
does
go
to
federal
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
the
other
reasons,
because
it
makes
some
difference
to
me
whether
there's
going
to
be
this
strange
line
between
negotiated
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
we
wrestled
with
that
issue
in
steel
co.,--
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you...
in
your
opinion,
if
there
is...
suppose
it
isn't
a
communications
case,
it's
common,
isn't
it,
if,
say
the
california
state
coastal
authority,
a
state
agency,
orders
someone
to
do
thus-and-so,
they
could
say
in
federal
court,
that
order
violates
a
federal
statute,
all
right.
now,
in
your
case,
if
there
were
plaintiff
just
like
this
one,
and
he
went
into
a
federal
court
and
said,
your
state
court
order
violates
a
federal
statute...
so
in
other
words,
suppose
it
were
much
more
clear,
are
you
saying
there,
there's
no
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
may
often
be,
with
the
california
state
coastal
commission
somebody
says,
this
is
a
taking
of
my
property,
or
something
simpler.
now,
it
could
be
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
underlying
state
order
in
order
to
deal
with
the
federal
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
thees
cases
00-1531
and
00-1711,
united
states
versus
public
service
commission
of
maryland
come
to
us
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
telecommunications
act
of
1996
requires
that
incumbent
localexchange
carriers,
the
local
telephone
companies,
general
for
simplification
but
good
enough,
provide
interconnection
with
their
existing
networks
when
the
new
entrant
seeks
access
to
the
local
telecommunications
market.
the
act
requires
that
the
carriers’
established
reciprocal
compensation
arrangements
for
transporting
and
terminating
the
calls
of
each
other’s
customers
and
that
they
submit
these
interconnection
agreements
to
state
utility
commission
for
approval.
petitioner
verizon
maryland,
the
incumbent
localexchange
carrier
in
the
state
of
maryland
negotiated
an
interconnection
agreement
with
a
competitor
later
acquired
by
respondent,
mci
worldcom,
and
the
maryland
public
service
commission
approved
that
agreement.
soon
afterwards
however,
verizon
informed
worldcom
that
it
would
no
longer
pay
reciprocal
compensation
for
calls
made
by
verizon’s
customers
to
the
local
access
numbers
of
internet
service
providers.
verizon
took
the
position
that
isp
traffic,
internet
service
provide
traffic,
was
not
local
traffic
subject
to
the
reciprocal
compensation
agreement.
worldcom
filed
a
complaint
with
the
commission
and
the
commission
ordered
verizon
to
pay
reciprocal
compensation.
verizon
then
filed
an
action
in
federal
district
court
citing
as
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
section
252(e)(6)
of
the
1996
act
as
well
as
28
u.s.c.
section
1331,
and
naming
as
defendants
the
commission,
its
individual
members
in
their
official
capacities,
worldcom,
and
other
competing
carriers.
in
its
complaint,
verizon
alleged
that
the
commission’s
determination
that
verizon
must
pay
reciprocal
compensation
for
isp
traffic
violated
the
1996
act
and
a
federal
communications
commission
ruling.
the
complaint
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
order
was
unlawful,
the
order
of
the
maryland
commission,
and
an
injunction
prohibiting
enforcement
of
the
order.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
action
and
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed
holding
that
the
commission
had
not
waived
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity
from
suit
that
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young
does
not
permit
suit
against
the
individual
commissioner’s
in
their
official
capacities
and
that
neither
252(e)(6)
nor
section
1331
provides
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
over
verizon’s
claims
against
the
private
defendants.
verizon
and
the
united
states
which
had
intervened
in
the
suit
sought
certiorari
which
we
granted,
we
now
vacate
and
remand.
section
1331
provides
jurisdiction
over
verizon’s
claim
that
the
commission’s
order
is
preempted
by
federal
law.
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
under
section
1331
where
the
petitioner’s
right
to
recover
will
be
sustained
if
federal
law
has
given
one
construction
and
will
be
defeated
if
it
is
given
another
unless
the
claim
appears
to
be
insubstantial
and
frivolous.
here,
resolution
of
verizon’s
claim
turns
on
whether
the
act
or
an
fcc
ruling
precludes
the
commission
from
ordering
payment
of
reciprocal
compensation
and
there
is
no
suggestion
that
this
claim
is
frivolous.
even
if
section
252(e)(6)
of
the
act,
which
of
the
1996
act,
which
provides
for
federal
review
of
an
agreement
when
a
state
commission
makes
a
determination
under
section
252.
even
if
that
provision
does
not
confer
jurisdiction
over
verizon’s
claim,
a
question
we
need
not
decide
in
this
case,
that
section
at
least
does
not
divest
the
district
courts
of
their
authority
under
section
1331.
section
252(e)(6)
does
not
establish
any
distinctive
review
mechanism
for
the
commission
actions
that
it
covers
and
it
does
not
distinctively
limit
the
substance
to
relief
available,
nor
do
any
of
the
1996
acts
other
provisions
events
any
intent
to
preclude
federal
review
of
a
commission
determination
under
plain
old
28
u.s.c.
section
1331.
we
need
not
decide
whether
the
commission
waived
its
immunity
from
suit
by
voluntarily
participating
in
the
regulatory
regime
established
by
the
1996
act
because
in
our
view
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young
permits
verizon
suit
to
go
forward
against
the
state
commissioners
in
their
official
capacities.
in
determining
whether
the
ex
parte
young
doctrine
voids
and
eleventh
amendment
bar
the
suit,
a
court
need
only
conduct
a
straightforward
inquiry
into
whether
the
complaint
alleges
an
ongoing
violation
of
federal
law
and
seeks
relief
properly
characterized
as
prospective.
here,
verizon’s
prayer
for
injunctive
relief
that
state
official
be
restrained
from
enforcing
an
order
in
contravention
of
federal
law,
clearly
satisfies
our
straightforward
inquiry.
as
to
verizon’s
prayer
for
declaratory
relief,
even
though
verizon’s
seeks
a
declaration
of
the
past
as
well
as
the
future
in
effectiveness
of
the
commission’s
action
so
the
private
party’s
past
financial
liability
may
be
affected.
no
past
liability
of
the
state
or
of
any
of
its
commissioners
is
an
issue.
the
fourth
circuit
suggested
that
verizon’s
claims
could
not
be
brought
under
ex
parte
young
because
the
commission’s
order
was
probably
not
inconsistent
with
federal
law
at
all,
but
the
inquiry
into
whether
suit
lies
under
ex
parte
young
does
not
include
an
analysis
of
the
merits
of
the
claim.
nor
finally
is
there
any
merits
of
the
commission’s
argument
that
section
252(e)(6)
constitutes
a
detailed
and
exclusive
remedial
steam
like
the
one
held
in
seminole
tribe
of
florida
to
implicitly
exclude
ex
parte
young
actions.
the
court’s
decision
is
unanimous
except
that
justice
o’connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer
and
justice
ginsburg
join.
