initially,
i'd
like
to
note
that
although
this...
in
this
case
the
court
granted
certiorari
only
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction
under
section
1331,
if
the
court
determines
that
there
is
a
standing
problem
in
the
mathias
case,
all
of
the
other
questions
on
which
the
court
granted
cert
in
that
case
are
also
presented
here,
and
section
1331
gives
the
district
courts
jurisdiction
over
claims
at
least
that
a
state
commission
has
acted
contrary
to
controlling
federal
law
in
construing
or
enforcing
an
interconnection
agreement.
such
claims
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
section
1331.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
how
is
that
acting
contrary
to
federal
law?
for
example,
let's
say
that
the
fcc
had
issued
a
different
order
with
respect
to
internet
calls
than
it
actually
did.
what
if
the
fcc
had
said
that
no
agreement
under
section
252
can
be
construed
as
providing
reciprocal
compensation
for
internet
service
provider--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
it...
the
commission
conceivably
could
have
said
if
the
contract
is
silent
on
the
specific
subject--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--or
whatever.
in
any
event,
one
can
envision
circumstances
in
which--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it
may
not.
it
may
be--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it
may
be
the
rare
case
in
which
a
state
commission
decision
interpreting
a
negotiated
agreement
will...
can
be
alleged
to
violate
federal
law.
i
think
the
questions
are
more
likely
to
come
up
with
respect
to
interpretation
of
terms
of
an
arbitrated
agreement
where
the
state
commission
was--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--this
has
been
sort
of
a
moving
target,
because
the
fcc's
orders
have
been
subject
to
review
and
have
been
vacated,
so...
but
the
claim
was
that
under
the
commission's
initial
order
with
respect
to
internet
calls--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
the
state
commission,
after
looking
at
the
fcc's
orders
and
the
statute,
decided
that
there
was...
the
fcc
had
said
it
was
permissible
to
adopt
either
rule,
to
read
these
agreements
either
as
providing
reciprocal
compensation
for
these
calls
or
not,
and
gave
some
factors
that
state
commissions
might
look
to
in
construing
agreements,
and
that
is
what
it
did.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
and
certainly
it's
subject
to
the
standards
of
252(d)
with
respect
to
assuring
that
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
is
served,
and
it
needs
to
look
at
the
polices
as
articulated
in
the
telecommunications
act
and
by
the
fcc
in
its
regulations
and
orders,
so
it's
a
broader
mandate
than
just
looking
at
the
parties'
intent,
yes.
whether
this
will
always
present
an
issue
of
federal
law
is,
of
course,
not
clear,
but
where
there
is
a
claim
that
what
the
state
commission
has
done
is
contrary
to
the
1996
act,
to
the
fcc's
orders
under
the
act,
or
to
some
other
provision
of
federal,
constitutional,
or
statutory
law--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--verizon's
complaint,
and
that's
in
the
court
of
appeals
joint
appendix,
was
really
quite
bare
bones.
it
alluded
to
the
fcc
order
that's
since
been
vacated,
as
you
mentioned,
and
to
other
principles
of
federal
law,
and
it
just
simply
alleged
that
the
maryland
commission's
decision
was
inconsistent
with
federal
law,
also
with
the
language
of
the
agreement,
and
is
arbitrary
and
capricious,
so
it
was
a
very
general
claim.
the
district
court
construed
verizon's
claim
as
being
that
the
public
service
commission's
order
is
in
direct
conflict
with
a
declaratory
ruling
of
the
fcc,
and
that's
on
pages
1
to
2
of
the
court
of
appeals
joint
appendix.
i
think
the
principal--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
true.
there's
now
a
new
ruling,
and
that's
being
litigated
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
i
think
as
currently
articulated
verizon
contends
that
among
other
things
the
maryland
commission's
order
is
contrary
to
section
252(a)(1)
of
the
act,
which
requires
these
agreements
to
be
binding,
and
the
allegation
is
that
the
commission
has
violated
that
commission
by
writing
additional
terms
into
a
party's
agreement.
whether
that
is
a
viable
claim
or
not
need
not
be
decided
at
this
point.
it's
at
least
a
sufficiently
nonfrivolous
claim
to
state
a
federal
claim.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
precisely
how
it
would
work
out
in
every
case.
when
the--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes.
when
there
is
a
claim
that
a
state
commission
order
is
contrary
to
controlling
federal
law,
that
claim
should
come
into
federal
court.
if
the
only
claim
is
a
violation
of
state
law,
it
should
go
into
state
court.
if
there
are
both
kinds
of
claims,
they
can
perhaps
be
brought
in
federal
court
under
supplemental
jurisdiction,
but
then
there's
a
question
of
the
state
officials'
sovereign
immunity,
assuming
that
they're
a
party
and
they
haven't
waived
sovereign
immunity,
because
the
state
law
claims
can't
be
adjudicated
under...
according
to
pennhurst
in
federal
court.
so
the
optimal
solution
in
many
of
these
cases
may
be
to
bifurcate,
or
may
be
to
bring
the
case
in
state
court,
and
the
state
courts,
of
course,
are
competent
to
hear
these
cases
as
well,
but
we
don't
think
that
congress
intended
to
preclude
the
opportunity
of
parties
to
go
to
federal
court
on
these
claims
when
they
have
a
federal
claim
under--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
it
is
the
system
that
we
have
generally,
your
honor.
parties
do
have
the
option
of
taking
their
claims
to
state
court
or
to
federal
court,
and
congress
may
have
been--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
we
already
know,
of
course,
under
section
252(e)(4)
of
the
act
that
a
number
of
these
cases
are
going
to
be
in
federal
court,
and
what
seems
particularly
irrational
is
that
if
there
was
exclusive
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
some
category
of
cases
and
exclusive
state
court
jurisdiction
over
the
same
sorts
of
issues
when
they
arise
in
an
interpretation
context
as
opposed
to
an
approval
context,
so
that
seems
clearly
what
congress
could
not
have
meant.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
i
think
this
particular
issue
involves
large
amounts
of
money--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--tens
if
not
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars,
and
that's
why
it's
being
litigated.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
wouldn't
say
it's
the
only
thing
they've
been
fighting
about,
and
i'm
not
familiar
with
all
the
cases
that
may
have
been
brought,
but
certainly
these
are
the
leading
categories
of
cases
at
the
interpretation
stage.
certainly
at
the
initial
approval
stage
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
have
made
their
way
to
federal
court
on
a
variety
of
issues
which
principally
concern
whether
the
state
commission
has--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--right.
it
also
should
be
noted
that
most
of
these
interconnection
agreements
build
in
some
form
of
alternative
dispute
resolution
process
that
there
is
some
negotiation
between
the
parties.
sometimes
there
is
formal
arbitration
to
resolve
these
disputes,
so
it's
not
necessarily
clear
that
they
will
all
proceed
through
this
particular
process.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
don't
think
there
are
nearly
that
many
state
proceedings.
in
some
of
these
cases
involving
reciprocal
compensation
for
internet
calls,
yes,
parties
have
asserted,
as
they
have
here,
state
law
claims
as
well
as
federal
law
claims,
and
some
federal
courts,
at
least
where
there's
been
no
objection
raised
by
the
state
commission,
relating
to
sovereign
immunity,
have
exercised
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
these
claims.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
but
this
isn't
their--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that
might
indeed
be
a
sufficient
explanation.
i
would
preface
this
by
saying
that
although
local
competition
surely
has
traditionally
been
regulated
by
the
states,
this
act
dealt
with
something
a
little
different,
encouraging
competition
between
local
carriers,
which
was
quite
new
at
the
time
this
1996
act
was
adopted.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
it
certainly
is
clear
from
the
act
that
congress
hoped
that
state
commissions
would
want
to
regulate
these
agreements
to
bring
their
expertise
with
local
conditions
and
with
local
telecommunications
to
bear,
although
congress,
of
course,
also
gave
states
the
option
of
allowing
the
fcc
to
do
that.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
not
really,
no.
the
only
arguable
legislative
history
that
seems
relevant
is
that
the
state
utility
commissioners
through
their
organizations
came
to
congress
and
said,
we've
started
to
do
this,
we
would
like
to
have
a
role
in
this,
and
congress
apparently
heard
them
in
enacting--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
and
that
all
argues
all
the
more
for
federal
court
review
under
1331
to
assure
some
uniformity
in
the
application
of
the
federal
standards
in
the
act.
if
i
could
reserve--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--i
believe
that
if
the
fcc
resolves
these
issues
it
may
turn
to
state
law.
it
hasn't
had
the
opportunity
to
issue
a
decision
on
this
yet,
but
those
decisions
would
be
reviewable
only
in
the
courts
of
appeals
under
the
hobbs
act,
whether
they
involve
state
law
or
federal
law
issues.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
might
or
might
not.
one
would
think
the
extent
of
the
waiver
would
be
governed
by
section
252(e)(6),
which
refers
to
review
to
ascertain
whether
the
agreement
or
statement
complies
with
sections
251
and
252.
that
might
be
too
narrow
to
encompass
state
law
as
well.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
second
person
doesn't
reserve.
you
use
it
or
lose
it.
