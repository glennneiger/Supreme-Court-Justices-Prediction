what
about
the
provision
of
the
statute
itself,
that
says
if
the
states
want
to
do
it,
they
can
do
it?
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
don't
do
it,
the
federal
government...
isn't
that...
don't
you
start
off
with
a
hodge
podge?
it's
going
to
be
state
regulation
some
places,
federal
regulation
other
places?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
thrust
of
your
point.
that's
entirely
consistent
with
the
argument
we
heard
this
morning,
though,
is
it
not,
because
they're
basically
saying
it's
all
a
matter
of
federal
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
made
the
same
argument
at
the
district
court
level,
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you're
not
going
to
drag
us
back
into
that
again,
are
you?
