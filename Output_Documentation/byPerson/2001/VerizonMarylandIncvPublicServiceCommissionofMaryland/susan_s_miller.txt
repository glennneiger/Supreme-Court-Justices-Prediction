ms.
susan
s.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
out
with
giving
you
a
little
factual
background
of
what
the
commission
considered
and
what
verizon
appealed.
essentially,
the
fcc
issued
an
order
saying
that
isp
calls
to
isp's
were
largely
interstate.
that
order
also
said,
for
those
companies
that
had
already
approved
agreements,
the
state
commission
was
to
look
at
contract
principles
to
see
if
the
parties
should
be
bound
by
their
previous
agreements,
and
whether
their
previous
agreements
should
be
interpreted
to
include
calls
to
isp's
being
local.
that's
what
the
maryland
commission
did
in
this
instance.
verizon
appealed
to
federal
district
court
raising
two
issues.
the
first
issue
was
that,
under
maryland
contract
law,
the
commission
had
misinterpreted
the
contract.
that's
the
first
issue
that
they
raised.
that
was
clear
from
their
motion
for
summary
judgment,
which
is
part
of
the
record
of
the
case,
but
i
don't
believe
it's
included
in
any
appendix
to
the
case.
the
second
issue
they
raised
is,
after
the
commission
had
interpreted
the
contract
principles,
the
commission
determined
that
the
fcc
order
required
them
to
develop
an
intercarrier
compensation
mechanism
until
such
time
as
the
fcc
had
developed
its
own
compensation
mechanism.
now,
what
verizon
said
was
that
the
commission
was
wrong,
that
the
fcc
didn't
require
that,
that
they
made
it
discretionary
for
the
commission,
and
those
were
the
only
two
issued
raised
by
verizon
in
this
case.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
their--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--their
claim...
what
they
argued
on
their
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
that
maryland
contract
law
became
federal
common
law,
and
that
thus
it
was--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--that
was
their
argument.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
whatever
their
contract
law
is.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
so
those
were
the
two
issues
that
were
raised
by
verizon.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
i
just
want
to
make
clear
that
what
they
were
raising
was
a
contract
issue.
they're
claiming
that
all
contract
issues
are
also
federal
law
now.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
the
court
was
clear
that
what...
the
sole
thing
they
were
raising
was
a
contract
issue.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
that--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--it
had
become
federal
common
law,
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
that's
correct.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
dismissed
the
1331
claim
on
the
basis
of
three
alternative
grounds.
the
first
ground
was
that
in
relying
on
jackson
transit
they
found
that
verizon's
claim
did
not
meet
the
arising
under
standard
contained
in
1331.
according
to
the
fourth
circuit,
the
fact
that
interconnection
agreements
are
creations
of
federal
law
did
not
in
and
of
itself
raise
a
substantial
federal
question.
the
fourth
circuit
also
relied
on
shoshone
mining,
which
said
that
federal
question
jurisdiction
isn't
established
where
local
rules
or
customs
would
govern
the
result,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
of
course.
maryland
contract
law
is
what
governed
the
result
here,
that
under...
specifically
under
252
the
negotiating
parties
had
absolutely
no
obligation
to
include
anything
from
251
and
252
in
their
contract.
for
that
reason,
negotiated
contracts
are
kind
of
taken
away
from
those
aspects
of
the
telecommunications
act.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
we
still
believe
it
wouldn't
come
under
1331,
but
for
differences
other
than
jackson
transit.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
yes.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
the
petitioners
really
haven't
distinguished
jackson
transits.
both
cases
involve
the
precise
question
of
whether
an
action
for
breach
of
contract
arises
under
federal
law
merely
because
the
contract
required...
merely
because
congress
required
the
contract
to
be
formed,
or
required
that
the
contract--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--i
disagree
with
that
reading
of
jackson
transit
they
noted
one
sentence
that
they
said
led
them
to
believe
that
congress
wouldn't
have
wanted
these.
there
are
also
several
other
circuit
court
cases,
however,
that
have
interpreted
jackson
transit
to
say
that
where
state
law
governs
the
decision
before
the
court,
then
there
is
no
federal
question
jurisdiction
regardless
of
whether
the
contract
terms
were
required
to
be
incorporated
or
not.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
i
believe
it--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--well--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--i
think--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--i
don't
believe
they
can,
and
i
think
that
was
what
was
the
problem
with--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--i
think
under
jackson
transit
what
they've
said
is
that
you
haven't
raised
a
federal
question.
that's
what
jackson
transit
said.
if
you
take
a
contract,
and
your
only
basis
of
the
contract
was
that
it
was
required
by
federal
law,
then
that
doesn't
even
raise
a
federal
question.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
that
would
be
a
closer
question
as
to
whether
that
actually
raises
a
substantial
federal
question
regarding
whether...
because
it
would
obviously
limit
a
state
commission's
interpretation.
the
state
commission
could
not
interpret
the
word
in
a
different
way.
the
second
basis
for
the
fourth
circuit's
dismissal
of
the
1331
claim
was
essentially
based
on
this
court's
merrell
dow
decision.
in
merrell
dow,
the
court
found
that
where
a
federal
statute
includes
a
limited
grant
of
jurisdiction,
that
any
other
broader
grant
of
jurisdiction
would
flout
the
intent
of
congress.
based
on
that,
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
252(e)(6)
was
a
limited
grant
of
jurisdiction
and
that
therefore
it
should
not
allow
suit
to
be
brought
under
1331.
the
respon...
the
petitioners
have
argued
that
the
rule
is
otherwise
that
essentially
the
courts
have
this
broad
grant
authority
unless
there
is
some
limitation,
but
all
the
cases
cited
by
the
respondents
involve
federal
agencies,
and
there's
a
distinction
here,
because
what
the
federal
agencies
were
arguing
was
essentially
that
there
was
absolutely
no
review
of
what
was
at
issue,
that
you
couldn't
bring
it
under
1331,
there
was
no
other
statute,
essentially
it
was
a
discretionary
act
of
the
agency,
and
you
couldn't
bring
it,
and
in
that
sense
the
court--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--that's
correct.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
it's
that
252
represents
a
limited
grant
of
jurisdiction
on
behalf
of
congress,
and
that
congress
only
intended
such
a
limited
grant
of
jurisdiction,
and
that
therefore
to
use
a
broader
grant
of
jurisdiction
such
as
1331
would
defy
congressional
intent.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
it...
but
it
also
preserves
the...
how
1331
has
been
analyzed
in
the
past,
and
how
1331
has
been
analyzed
under
merrell
dow
is
that
you
look
at
the
statute,
and
if
the
statute
has
a
limited
grant
of
authority,
then
that's
congressional
intent
that
that
be
the
only
authority,
so
601
didn't
change
the
analysis,
it
just
says
you
use
the
same
analysis,
and
in
this
case
the
analysis
is,
under
merrell
dow,
there
is
a
jurisdictional
statute
in
the
statute
at
issue,
so
no
other
statutes...
so
1331,
which
is
a
broader
grant
of
jurisdiction,
should
not
be
used.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
well,
but
they're...
for
negotiated
agreements
they're
not
required
to
incorporate
anything
involving
251
and
252,
so
they've
made
the
choice
to
not
include
those
federal
standards
by
negotiating
an
agreement
rather
than
having
it
arbitrated,
so
in
that
sense,
no,
it
would
not
raise
a
federal
question.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
i
don't
know
that
it's
so
in
any...
in
every
instance.
in
this
instance,
for
a
matter
of
fact,
the
initial
contract
at
issue
with
mfs
and
telenet,
verizon
actually
agreed
to
a
reciprocal
compensation
rate
that
was
higher
than
the
commission's
arbitrated
rate.
now,
for
what
reason,
i
don't
know.
presumably
they
traded
something
else
for
that.
so
it's
not
necessarily
so
that
whatever's
in
the
statute
the
parties
agree
to,
and
if
the
parties
agree
to
that,
then
they've
chosen
to
agree
to
that
rather
than
go
to
the
state
commission
and
say,
federal
law
requires
this,
we
don't
want
to
agree
to
it,
but
we
recognize
that
you
have
the
authority
to
order
us
to
do
it.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
well,
we
think
it
would
not
end
up
in
federal
court
for
other
reasons,
but
we...
but--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--well,
if
you're
talking
about
13...
going
into
federal
court
under
1331--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--our
argument
would
be
the
private
right
of
action
argument,
that
1331,
you
have
to
look
at
the
four
court
factors
and
things
like
that,
and
that
therefore
those
wouldn't
end
up
under
1331
either,
and
also
the
same
argument--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--i
don't
believe,
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question,
i
was
treating
them
the
same.
he
asked
me
what
other
issues
would
we
raise
to
say
that
this
arbitration
case
shouldn't
be
in
this
court,
and
that
was
one
of
the
issues
we
raised.
i
believe
that
there
are
cases
that
essentially
say
that
a
cause
of
action
is
a
matter,
a
matter
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
there
are
several
circuit
courts
that
have
interpreted
this
court's
merrell
dow
case
in
that
manner,
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
even
reach
this,
because
i
think
the
cases
can
be
upheld
based
on
the
fourth
circuit
analysis,
and
any
one
of
the
three
alternatives
raised.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
and--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--do
you
want
to
know
what
the
fourth
circuit...
how
the
fourth
circuit
distinguished
your
steel
co.
case?
ms.
susan
s.
miller
what
the
fourth
circuit
claimed
you
were
doing
in
steel
co.
is
that
you
were
distinguishing
between
article
iii
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
which
had
to
be
decided
before
you
reached
the
merits,
and
statutory
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
which
you
didn't
have
to
decide
before
you
reached
the
merits
under
that
hypothetical
jurisdiction
issue.
that's
how
the
fourth
circuit
has
interpreted
steel
co.--
so
in
this
instance
i
believe
the
petitioners
are
wrong
in
their
analysis
that
you
have
1331
jurisdiction
unless
congress
specifically
precludes
1331
jurisdiction.
the
only
cases
that
has
occurred
has
been
with
regard
to
federal
agencies,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
and
that
was
because
to
find
that
1331
wasn't
broad
enough
to
encompass
a
federal
agency
would
mean
that
there
would
be
absolutely
no
review,
so
i
think
that
there
is
a
distinction
that
is
important
between
the
two
cases.
the
final
reason
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
the
1331
claim
should
be
dismissed
was
the
rooker-feldman
doctrine.
under
that
doctrine,
it
involves
essentially
a
statutory
interpretation
element
and
a
federalism
element.
the
statutory
interpretation
element
is
that
1257
grants
original
jurisdiction
to
this
court
and
this
court
alone
over
state...
i'm
sorry.
1257
alone
grants
this
court
appellate
review
of
state
court
decisions,
and
that
the
federal
district
courts
only
have
review
over
original
actions,
original
civil
actions,
and
that
by
implication,
therefore,
federal
district
courts
have
no
review
over
state
court
actions.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
i
think
that's
distinguishable
because
in
the
case
you
referred
to
the
district
court
already
had
jurisdiction
over
federal
claims
that
were
totally
separate
and
apart
from
the
on-record
administrative
review.
essentially,
the
federal
claims
could
have
been
brought
without
actually
reviewing
the
record
and
the
order
in
the
case.
it
was
because
the
federal
district
court
already
had
that
jurisdiction
over
those
claims
that
this
court
found
it
could
exercise
its
supplemental
jurisdiction
and
also
hear
those
claims
that
involved
the
on-the-record
state
court...
actually,
i
think
it
was
actually
a
local
administrative
agency
in
that
case,
but
the
on-the-record
review.
so
i
think
this
is
different
in
that
verizon
raises
no
claims
that
are
separate
and
apart
from
the
on-the-record
review
and
decisions
of
the
maryland
public
service
commission,
so
in
this
instance
the
federal
district
court
will
be
acting
as
an
appellate
court,
particularly
since
i
believe
virtually
every
federal
district
court
that
has
considered
the
issue
has
said
in
telecommunications
cases
it's
not
a
de
novo
review,
it
is
an
on-the-record
review,
so
in
this
instance
they
will
be
performing
an
appellate
action
rather
than
an
original
civil
action.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
there,
there
would
be
federal
jurisdiction
if
the
basis
of
that
claim
didn't
require
the
appellate...
the
federal
district
court,
excuse
me,
to
actually...
to
review
the
determinations
of
the
maryland
public
service
commission
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
their
order
violated
a
federal
law,
essentially--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--to
a
certain
extent
you
would
be
looking
at
the
federal...
the
state
order,
but
you
would
not
be
overturning
the
state
order
on
the
basis
that
the
state
commission
found.
you
would
be
saying,
yes,
you
found
this,
but
the
problem
is,
what
you
found
now
implicates
this,
so--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--that
would
be
correct.
they
would
have
to
go
through
the
state
court
proceedings
in
that,
and
have
it
resolved
in
that
manner.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
we
were
not
dismissed
from
the
case
the
whole
case
was
dismissed.
ms.
susan
s.
miller
well--
ms.
susan
s.
miller
--no,
your
honor.
at
the
federal
district
court
level,
essentially
the
court
decided
that
we
had
eleventh
amendment
immunity
and
that
we
were
indispensable
parties
and,
as
such,
the
entire
case
had
to
be
dismissed.
the
federal
district
court
also
addressed
the
1331
issue
and
found
that
it
would
not
imply
a
private
right
of
action,
and
that
the...
and
that
his
eleventh
amendment
analysis
probably
would
pertain
to
the
1331
claim
as
well.
that's
all
i
have,
unless
there
are
any
other
questions.
