justice
david
h.
souter
let's
put
the
question
the
other
way.
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
provide
for
a
bifurcated
scheme,
which
we
know
is
going
to
lead
to
all
kinds
of
pleadings
chicanery
in
order
to
get
it
into
one
court
or
another
court,
and
we're
going
to
have
endless
disputes
about
the
pleadings.
why
would
congress
have
wanted
that
kind
of
a
system?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
you're...
aren't
you
positing
a
system
in
which
there...
i
was
going
to
say,
aren't
you
positing
a
system
in
which,
as
a
system,
we
assume
there
is
going
to
be
some
kind
of
a
system
of
utility
regulation,
and
there
isn't
going
to
be
a
system.
some
utility
regulation
through
contract
interpretation
is
going
to
be
done
in
state
courts,
some
of
it's
going
to
he
done
in
federal
courts,
parties
in
essentially
the
same
situation
are
going
to
be
making
inconsistent
choices,
and
you're
not
going
to
have
a
resulting
coherent
system.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
the
question
justice
scalia
doesn't
want
to
ask,
and
that
is,
do
you
have
any
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
they
really
did
intend
the
hodge
podge?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
if
they
intended
a
hodge
podge,
i
will
say
god
bless
the
hodge
podge,
but
i
don't...
i
haven't
heard
anyone
getting
into
the
legislative
background
to
indicate
that
they
didn't.
do
you
have
anything?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
the
federal
law
is
borrowed
law
so
far
as
it
involves
the
interpretation
of
a
contract.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say
to
the
provision
that
your
brother
quoted
to
the
effect
that
there
will
be
no
modification
of
federal
statutory
law
unless
it's
express
modification,
which
would
preserve
the
full
extent
of
1331,
i
suppose?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
what
if
the
federal
objection
was
raised
at
the
administrative
level,
so
that
the
administrator,
the
administrative
body
had
said,
no
federal
problem.
in
that
case,
i
take
it,
your
answer
would
be
no,
they
can't
go
into
federal
court.
