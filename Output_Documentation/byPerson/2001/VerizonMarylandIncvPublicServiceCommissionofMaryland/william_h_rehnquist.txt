we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
00-1531,
verizon
maryland
v.
the
public
service
commission
of
maryland
and
united
states
v.
public
service
commission
of
maryland.
mr.
evans.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
252(a)(1)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
justice
stevens'
example
in
the
previous
case,
do
you
pay
on
tuesday
or
do
you
pay
on
thursday?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
answer
to
the
jackson
transit
case,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
evans.
ms.
mcdowell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
actual
question
before
the
commission?
is
it,
what
did
these
parties
mean
by
their
agreement,
and
nothing
more
than
that,
or
is
it
something
with
more
legal
overtones
to
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
meant
the
rules
of
the
state
commission,
not
the
fcc.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
instance,
if
you
go
to
a
state
court,
i'm
a,
i'm
suing
b
because
we
have
a
contract,
the
final
decision
of
the
state
court
isn't
just
necessarily
the
parties
agree
to
this.
they
have
to
go
further
and
say,
well,
is
this...
is
there
any
state
law
prohibition
against
this
kind
of
an
agreement,
and
what
are
the
results
in
this
particular
case,
does
a
owe
b
money.
does
the
commission,
state
commission
have
that
broad
an
area
to
deal
with
the
contracts
under
this
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mcdowell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
mr.
evans
i
thought
was
the
first.
ms.
miller.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
evans
offered
one
distinction,
that
there
was
substantial
legislative
history
there
saying
that
congress
wanted
these
actions
to
be
brought
in
state
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
now--
--your
position
is
that
there's
no
jurisdiction
under
252,
and
there's
also
no
jurisdiction
under
1331.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
it
because
252
by
implication
prohibits
1331
jurisdiction,
or
just
that
1331
isn't
broad
enough
to
cover
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words,
congress
intended
federal
jurisdiction
over
review
of
approval
agreements,
but
didn't
intend
federal
jurisdiction
over
anything
else?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
section
251
of
the
telecommunications
act,
which
does
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
standards
for
these
agreements.
wouldn't
that
make
it
a
federal
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
ms.
miller.
mr.
evans,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
evans.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
00-1531,
verizon
maryland,
inc.
versus
public
service
commission
of
maryland
and
the
companion
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
