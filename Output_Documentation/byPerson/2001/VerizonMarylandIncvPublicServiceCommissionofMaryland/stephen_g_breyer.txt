justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
a
tariff...
i
mean,
you're
talking
about
a
state
railroad
tariff?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
of
course
a
federal
railroad
tariff
is
a
federal
question.
nobody
doubts
that.
what
they're
saying
is,
here,
the
structure
of
this
statute
is
to
have
state
commissions
run
these
agreements,
period.
now,
of
course,
they
have
to
be
sure
that
the
state
commission
satisfies
certain
federal
standards,
which
might
have
been
minimal
but
have
turned
out
not
to
be
so
minimal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
so
i
don't
see
how
in
answer
to
justice
stevens...
and
i
think
it
does
create
a
problem.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
put
all
the...
every
detail
of
this
state
contract
in
a
federal
court,
calling
it
a
federal
question,
and
once
that's
so,
there
does
become
an
issue
as
to
whether
congress
bifurcated
this
and
said,
as
is
true
of
all
other
state
agencies,
you
have
a
federal
question,
you
can
go
into
federal
court.
or
said,
throw
them
all
in
the
state.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
get
a
clear
restatement,
if
you
like,
of
just
what
you
think...
i
mean,
on
the
overall
question
i
now
see
three
possible
ways
you
could
go.
way
number
1
is
just
what
we
heard.
these
contracts
are
creatures
of
the
federal
law,
so
much
so
that
everything
about
them
is
federal,
they
all
go
into
federal
court.
the
opposite
view,
no,
everything
about
them
goes
into
state
court,
with
one
exception.
the
exception
is
approval
or
rejection,
which
is
a
narrow
proceeding
that
happens
once.
that
puts
98
percent
of
the
cases
in
state
court
for
everything.
choice
3,
the
compromise,
which
is
some
form
of
which
i
think
you're
advocating.
that
would
have
to
be,
the
federal
questions
come
into
federal
court
under
either
252
or
1331.
i
don't
know
if
it
makes
any
difference,
but
they're
in
federal
court,
the
federal
questions,
and
where
they're
all
mixed
up
with
state
interpretation
you
have
three
choices.
each
federal
judge
is
on
his
own.
1)
it's
their
supplementary
jurisdiction,
2)
they
have
some
form
of
abstention,
to
wait,
3)
they
do
something
else.
i
don't
know
what
it
is,
all
right.
but
in
other
words,
let's
call
that
a
hybrid
approach.
i
want
to
know
which
of
those
three
positions
the
government
takes,
and
i
think
it's
the
last
one,
and
i
want
to
know
precisely
how
all
this
works
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know
your
favorite
view
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
know...
do
you
have
any
sense
of
this
in
the
hybrid...
in
the
hybrid
system
that
we're
describing
as
concerning
justice
souter,
that
i
agree
with
you
is
supposed
to
be
the
norm
in
respect
to
state
agencies
after
the
chicago
case.
now,
one
of
the
concerns
in
chicago,
and
you
may
have
come
across
this
in
your
reading,
or
just
experience,
would
be
there
would
be,
then,
a
lot
of
cases,
because
it
covers
every
state
agency,
where
people
would
run
into
federal
court
on
a
federal
question
related
to
a
basically
state
matter,
and
they'd
bring
in
and
get
review
through
the
supplementary
jurisdiction
of
all
kinds
of
state
issues.
has
that
happened?
i
mean,
is
this
the
norm?
do
you
have
any
sense
of
what
actually
happens
in,
let's
say,
the
40
million
state
proceedings
that
go
on
every
week?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
saw
two
federal
questions,
and
either
way
it
seems
federal.
his
first
point,
as
justice
stevens
said,
was
there's
some
words
in
this
contract.
this
contract
is
a
creature
of
federal
law.
the
interpretation
of
every
one
of
those
words
is
a
federal
question,
whatever
source
of
law
that
you
might
come...
turn
to
to
figure
out
what
federal
law
is,
whether
it's
maryland,
or
whether
it's
alaska,
or
whether
it's
some
totally
different
place.
argument
2,
that
the
federal
communications
commission
in
a
series
of
decisions,
whatever
may
be
true
of
other
words
in
the
contract,
has
said
that
these
words
in
the
contract,
a,
b,
c,
d,
mean,
and
then
he
gets
the
result
he
wants,
all
right,
so
he's
looking
both
to
the
f...
which
obviously
the
fcc
does
have
the
power
to
do
that,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
it
could
say
as
a
matter
of
fcc
rule
any
contract
that
has
words
a,
b,
and
c,
must
be
interpreted
to
mean
thus
and
so
under
this
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
it
seemed
to
me
they're
making
some
combination
of
those
two
arguments.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
got
us
into
this,
i'd
modify
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
simply
a
matter
of,
wouldn't
that
state
a
federal
question?
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
is,
but
somebody
who
says
just
what
i
said
has
raised
a
federal
question,
haven't
they,
just
as
somebody
who
says
this
contract
is
a
creature
of
federal
law,
the
word
interpretation
is
federal,
has
raised
a
federal
question,
and
you
would
reply,
you're
wrong
about
what
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
but
that's
different
from
saying
you
haven't
raised
a
federal
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
not
saying
it
was
required
by
federal
law.
they're
saying
that
the
words
of
the
contract,
what
they
mean
is
federal
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
may
i
ask
you
a
procedural
question?
i
hate
to
do
this,
but
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
case.
your
client's
the
commission.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
commission
first
raised
an
eleventh
amendment
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
it
was
dismissed
from
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
whole
case...
how
did
the
1331
come
up,
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
decided
as
to
your
client,
you're
out
of
it
because
of
eleventh
amendment.
as
to
the
rest
of
them
they
were
out
of
it
because
of
1331,
or--
