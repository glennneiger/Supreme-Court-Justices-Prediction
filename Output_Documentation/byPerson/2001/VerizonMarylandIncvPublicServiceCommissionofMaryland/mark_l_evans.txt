mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
unlike
mr.
smith,
verizon
takes
the
position
that
these
contracts
are,
in
fact,
pervasive
and
federal,
and
i'd
like
to
tell
you
why.
the
statute,
by
its
terms,
requires
us
to
enter
into
these
relationships
whether
we
want
to
or
not.
it
dictates
the
subject
matter
of
the
negotiations,
it
provides
that
the
agreement
has
to
be
approved
by
the
state
commission
but
under
federal
standards
spelled
out
in
the
statute.
once
approved,
moreover,
these
agreements
are
binding
not
as
a
matter
of
state
law
but
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
which
is
provided
for
in
252(a)(1)
of
the
statute.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
(a)(1),
and
finally,
and
in
some
ways
most
tellingly,
every
provision
of
an
approved
agreement
is
like
a
tariff
made
available
automatically
to
every
other
carrier
that
wishes
to
adopt
them,
and
the
court
upheld
that
in
the
iowa
utilities
case
even
though
it
was
challenged,
but
the
function
of
not
only
the
agreement's
terms
but
every
interpretation
of
an
agreement's
terms
has
federal
reverberations.
these
are
not
cases
that...
with
which
the
federal
government
has
washed
its
hands.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
is
a
hard
question
in
terms
of
the
way
it
was
put,
and
i
think
the
answer,
to
be
consistent,
is
yes
it
belongs
in
federal
court,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
just
like
a
federal
tariff,
where
there's
a
question
about
the
payment
date,
it
belongs
in
federal
court.
that...
the
court
has
held
that
in
many
cases
involving
federal
tariffs,
one
of
which
we've...
two
of
which
we've
dealt
with
in
the
brief,
one
of
which
is
thurston
motor
lines,
which
is
in
460
u.s.--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--they're...
they're--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--limited
to--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--i'm
sorry.
they're
limited
to
the
boundaries
of
the
state
in
most
instances,
although
the
negotiations
in
one
state
have
reverberations
for
the
same
two
parties
in
other
states,
as,
for
example,
with
verizon.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
oh,
i
see.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
the...
i
don't
have
a
number,
justice
scalia.
i
can
say
that
i
don't
think
once
the
big
issues
are
resolved
there's
going
to
be
many
of
them,
and
the
big
issues
tend
to
be
like
the
issue
in
this
case,
where
the
very
contract
says,
on
the
point
in
dispute,
that
the
parties
agree
that
reciprocal
compensation
will
be
paid
only
to
the
extent
required
by
the
statute,
naming
a
specific
section
of
the
statute.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
mean,
yes,
but
as
a
practical
matter
the
issues
will
not
be
brought
to
federal
court
unless
there's
a
lot
of
money
involved
and
the
issues
are
very
important
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
it's
not
a
cost-free
proposition
to
go
to
federal
court.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
not
a--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
two
things,
justice
breyer.
first,
the...
if
you
look
back
at
this
court's
federal
tariff
cases
you
find
that
the
reason
these
cases
wound
up
in
federal
court,
even
though
lower
courts
in
the
cases
have
almost
routinely
said
this
looks
to
us
like
a
run-of-the-mill
state
contract
issue,
is
because
the
tariff
itself
derives
its
authority
and
depends
entirely
upon
the
federal
statute.
that's
what
makes
them
federal
statutes,
because
of
the
federal
government's
interest
in
the
whole
process.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
jackson
transit
actually
was
a
case
involving
a
contract
under
the
urban
mass
transit
act
in
which
the
court's
analysis
proceeded
as
follows.
first,
it
said
these
are
inherently,
pervasively
federal
contracts...
e
agree
with
that...
and
but
for
a
contrary
indication
in
the
text
of
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
we
would
view
those
as
federal
issues
that
belong
in
federal
court,
but
the
court
went
on
to
look
first
at
the
text
where
they
found
the
issue
not
conclusive,
and
then
to
the
legislative
history
where
it
found
that
congress
made
a
specific
determination
that
it
did
not
want
these
cases
in
federal
court.
there
is
no
such
analogy
in
the
case
here,
and
in
fact,
if
anything,
the
suggestion
is
to
the
contrary,
because
when
congress
did
address
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
albeit
it
perhaps
in
narrower
terms
than
we
would
have
liked.
it
made
clear
that
the...
that
there's
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
and
that,
moreover,
state
courts
are
foreclosed
from
involvement.
it's
odd
to
imagine
why
an
issue
like
the
one
in
this
case
which
could
just
as
well
have
come
up
at
the
approval
stage,
but
didn't
until
the
interpretation
stage,
in
part
because
the
internet
exploded
in
the
interim.
in
one
case
it
goes
to
federal
court,
in
the
other
case
it
goes
to
state
court.
it
just
doesn't...
it
doesn't
make
sense
that
congress
would
have
envisioned
that
outcome.
there
has
been
discussion
about
whether
252(e)(6)
in
some
way
restricts
the
provisions
of...
excuse
me,
the
availability
of
jurisdiction
under
section
1331,
and
we
think
the
answer
to
that
is
quite
clear
not
only
from
the
general
presumption
against
that
kind
of
restriction
that
the
court
has
articulated
from
time
to
time,
but
also
because
in
this
statute
congress
actually
enacted
a
specific
rule
of
construction
in
section
601(c)
of
the
act
which
is
actually
not
in
the
joint
appendix
and
not
codified.
it
appears
as
a...
in
the
note
to
47
u.s.c.
152,
and
what
it
said
there
was
that
nothing
in
the
act
should
be
construed
to
modify,
impair,
or
supersede
federal
law
unless
expressly
so
provided.
so
congress
spoke
to
what
inferences
could
be
drawn
from
a
limitation
of
jurisdiction
in
252(e)(6)
and,
moreover,
there...
the
court
has...
i
mean,
the
congress
has
shown
repeatedly,
both
in
this
statute
and
in
other
statutes,
that
when
it
wishes
to
preclude
review
in
one
court
system
or
another
it
spells
that
out
specifically,
as
it
does
in
252(e)(4)
here
with
respects
to
states,
as
it's
done
in
a
variety
of
statutes
that
we
and
the
government
have
cited
in
our
briefs
with
respect
to
the
other...
with
respect
to
the
medicare
act.
and
finally,
let
me
just
say
a
word
about
the
impracticality
of
the
bifurcation
that
i
think
mr.
smith
is
striving
for
here.
it
would
mean
a
bizarre
separation
where
a
case
could
come
up
with
an
interpretation
not
only
of...
not
only
of
the
issues
we
think
are
binding
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
but
also
state
law
issues
that
the
state
put
in
as
part
of
its
review,
and
from
mr.
smith's
point
of
view,
if
it's
interpretive,
it
all
goes
right
to
state
court.
in
our
view,
at
least
all
of
the
federal
issues
come
to
federal
court,
and
probably
the
state
issues
can
come
along
under
supplementary
jurisdiction,
although
there
may
be
a...
may
not
be
possible
to
name
the
state
in
that
context.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
and
this
court
once
before
had
before
it
a
bifurcation
scheme
that
had
been
proposed,
actually
decided
by
the
seventh
circuit,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
and
that's
the
bank
one
case
in
516
u.s.,
and
the
court
said,
this
is
just
too
unwieldy
and
inefficient
a
system
for
us
to
impute
the
congress,
even
if
the
language
were
clear,
and
here
the
language
by
no
means
even
supports
the
outcome.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
your
honor--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
would
just
like
to
read
two
provisions,
very
short
provisions
from
the
contract
that's
being
interpreted
here.
the
first
says,
reciprocal
compensation
is
as
described
in
the
act.
the
second
says,
as
described
in
the
act
means,
as
described
in
or
required
by
the
act,
meaning
the
'96
telecom
act,
and
as
from
time
to
time
interpreted
in
the
duly
authorized
rules
and
regulations
of
the
fcc
or
the
state
commission.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
decision
of
the
agency
here,
the
state
agency
here,
it
is
full
of
a
discussion
of
what
it
means,
what
reciprocal
compensation
is
required
under
the
act.
that
was
the
basis
for
the
interpretation.
the
effect
of
the
interpretation
was
to
say,
even
though
the
act
doesn't
require
it,
you
have
to
provide
it,
because
your
agreement
says
you're
going
to
provide
it,
and
we...
this
statement
says
just
the
opposite.
