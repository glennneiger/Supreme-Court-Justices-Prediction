justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
mcdowell,
would
you
clarify
what
you
define
as
the
federal
question
in
this
case?
there
were
a
lot
of
arguments
that
were
made
by
verizon
like,
this
is
a
federal
tariff,
in
effect,
like
the
state
commissioner
simply
is
saying
that
it
is
for
this
purpose
a
federal
agency.
in
your
brief,
the
only
thing
that
i
recall...
maybe
i
got
this
altogether
wrong...
was,
you
said
the
federal
question
is
an
fcc
order
which
would
be
controlling,
and
that
fcc
order,
it
turns
out,
has
been
vacated
by
the
d.c.
circuit,
so
i'm
really
left
at
sea
about
what
is
the
federal
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
ruling
has
been
vacated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
told
that
the
agreements
that
are
negotiated
are
not
very
far
distant
from
what
the
standards
are
under
the...
of
the
statute.
the
thing
is
so
set
up
that
the
parties
will
come
down
to
pretty
much
what's
in
the
statute.
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you're
blending
together
two
things--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
i
think
this
court's
decisions
keep
separate.
one
is
1331,
general
federal
question
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
you
have
to
have
first,
and
then
do
you
have,
would
you
survive
a
12(b)(6)
motion,
do
you
have
a
claim
for
relief,
and
you
treated
that
in
your
brief,
and
now
again,
as
though
they're
the
same
question,
and
they're
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
i
defended
in
steel
co.,
so
i'd
like
to
know
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
how
does
that
fit
in
with
city
of
chicago,
where
a
federal
district
court
did
sit
on
those
supplemental
jurisdiction
claims
as
a
reviewer
of
a
state
administrative
agency?
