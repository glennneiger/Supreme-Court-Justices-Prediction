john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
oh,
excuse
me.
may
i
ask
just
sort
of
a
broader
question?
my
recollection
is
that
all
the
cases
we're
familiar
with
so
far
run
around
as
one
issue
about
local
calls
to
the
internet
and
so
forth.
i
have
the...
a
feeling
that
there
must
be
a
pattern.
all
these
agreements
have
a
great
deal
of
similarity,
same
kind
of
issue,
same
kind
of
litigants
on
both
sides.
i
wonder
if
there
really
is
a
mountain
of
litigation
out
there,
or
if
they
only
have...
a
very
few
test
cases
may
resolve
most
of
these
issues.
what's
your
view
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
there
similar
issues
bouncing
around
in
state
and
federal
courts,
or
is
this
sort
of
the
only
thing
they're
fighting
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
the
approval
stage,
there's
no
doubt
about
where
those
go.
