justice
ruth
bader

moore,
may
i
ask
you?
on
that
on
that
branch
of
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
was,
the
prosecutor's
presentation
to
the
jury
was
about
a
match
for
the
defense
attorney's.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
had
another
question
that
i
wanted
to
ask
you,
and
that
was
you
presented
two
questions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
a
matter
and
and
the
sixth
circuit
proceeded
just
the
other
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
go
back
to
the
bronze
star?
it
certainly
did
come
out
in
the
sentencing
phase.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
th-
and
we
know
nothing
more
about
it
now?
nothing
came
out
in
the
tennessee
proceedings...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
it
were
there
any
problems
in
his
service
record?
he
served
in
germany
and
vietnam.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
the
line
is
it
know,
that
you
can
draw
a
line
one
place
doesn't
mean
it's
sensible
to
draw
it
every
place.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
w-
one
can
say
yes
i
see
these
are
two
parts
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
i
have
to
then
separate
every
examination
and
every
cross
examination
it's
a
question
of
where
you
draw
the
line.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
hutton,
this
was
a
very
short
proceeding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
shows
that
mr.
dice
did
did
something.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
you
about
those
words.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
the
sixth
circuit
reject
your
claim
about
the
guilt
phase?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
can
you
point
to
me
where
in
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
i
thought
in
their
opinion
they
rejected
your
claim
insofar
as
the
guilt
phase.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
nothing
in
the
military
record
that
the
lawyer
might
have
been
fearful
about
if
he
pursued
that
beyond
where
he
did?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
m-
i've
looked
back
at
the
opinion,
and
twice
the
sixth
circuit
says
that
they
deny
the
they
affirm
the
dismissal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
t-
you
told
me
when
i
asked
you,
no,
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
affirm
with
respect
to
the
sentence
of
conviction.
