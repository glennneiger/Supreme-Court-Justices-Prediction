01-400
bell
against
cone.
twenty
years
ago,
respondent
was
convicted
of
and
sentenced
to
death
for
the
murder
of
an
elderly
couple
in
memphis,
tennessee.
the
killings
culminated
a
two-day
crime
rampage
that
began
when
he
robbed
a
jewelry
store
in
memphis.
a
high
speed
chase
ensued.
he
abandoned
his
vehicle,
shot
a
police
officer
who
tried
to
arrest
him
and
a
citizen
who
confronted
him,
and
tried
to
shoot
another
person
who
refused
to
turnover
his
car
keys.
having
eluded
capture
until
morning,
he
drew
a
gun
on
an
elderly
resident
who
refused
to
let
him
use
their
telephone.
later
he
broke
into
the
home
of
shipley
and
cleopatra
todd,
aged
93
and
79
respectively,
and
killed
them
by
repeatedly
beating
them
about
the
head.
he
altered
his
opinion,
fled
to
florida
where
he
was
arrested
for
robbery.
a
tennessee
jury
convicted
him
of
two
counts
of
first
degree
murder,
three
counts
of
assault
with
intent
to
murder,
and
one
count
of
robbery
with
a
deadly
weapon.
the
defense’s
theory
at
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial
was
that
respondent
was
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
because
he
suffered
from
vietnam
veterans
syndrome
and
other
disorders
related
to
his
elicit
drug
use.
during
opening
statement
at
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial,
his
counsel
called
the
jury’s
attention
to
the
evidence
of
mitigating
circumstances
already
before
us,
and
pleaded
for
his
client’s
life.
the
state’s
witnesses
testified
briefly
about
the
undisputed
facts
the
respondent
had
prior
felony
convictions
and
was
evading
arrest.
the
junior
prosecuting
attorney
gave
a
low
key
closing.
the
defense
counsel
waived
final
argument,
preventing
the
senior
prosecuting
attorney
who
by
all
accounts
was
very
persuasive
from
arguing
and
rebuttal.
the
jury
found
the
respondent
should
receive
the
death
penalty.
the
tennessee
supreme
court
affirmed.
on
state
habeas
proceedings,
the
respondent
claimed
his
attorney
rendered
ineffective
assistance
at
the
penalty
phase
of
his
trial
by
not
presenting
further
mitigating
evidence
and
by
waiving
closing
arguments.
the
state
court’s
rejected
the
claim
under
principles
announced
in
our
decision
in
strickland
against
washington.
respondent
then
applied
for
federal
habeas
relief.
the
district
court
held
the
respondent
did
not
meet
2254(d)(1)
standard
because
the
state
court's
adjudication
of
his
claim
neither
was
contrary
to
nor
involved
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
concluding
that
respondent’s
sixth
amendment
claim
should
have
been
analyzed
under
united
states
against
cronic.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
2254(d)(1)
prevents
state
prisoners
from
obtaining
federal
habeas
relief,
unless
the
state
court
adjudication
of
their
claim
either
was
contrary
to
or
involved
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law.
respondent’s
claim
alleging
that
counsel
erred
by
failing
to
introduce
further
mitigating
evidence
and
waiving
final
argument
was
properly
analyzed
under
strickland’s
test
and
was
therefore
not
contrary
to
our
cronic
decision,
nor
did
its
analysis
involved
an
unreasonable
application
of
strickland.
respondent’s
counsel
was
faced
with
an
extremely
difficult
task
in
defending
his
client.
having
reviewed
the
circumstances
surrounding
council’s
decision
not
to
call
certain
witnesses,
to
waive
final
argument,
we
cannot
say
that
it
was
objectively
unreasonable
for
the
state
court
to
conclude
that
those
decisions
were
tactical
ones
about
which
competent
lawyers
might
disagree.
justice
steven
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
