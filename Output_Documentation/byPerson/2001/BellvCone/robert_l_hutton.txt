mr.
robert
l.
hutton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
the
main
problem
in
this
case
is
not
specific
attorney
errors.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
justice
o'connor,
he
did
but
i
would
like
to
clear
up
one
thing
that
mr.
moore
stated.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
justice
o'connor,
mr.
dice
did
make
an
opening
statement,
but
in
that
opening
statement,
he
also
told
the
jury
that
he
had
a
right
to
put
on
evidence
at
the
penalty
phase
and
had
a
right
to
make
a
closing
argument
in
the
penalty
phase.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
justice
scalia,
the
problem
in
this
case
and
the
reason
there's
a
total
abdication
of
advocacy
is
because
after
the
ca-
state
made
a
case
for
death,
after
the
state
put
on
proof
of
aggravating
circumstances
and
then
argued
to
the
jury
that
the
law
required
the
jury
to
put
mr.
cone
to
death,
there
was
silence.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
justice
kennedy,
the
only
role
of
an
advocate
in
the
penalty
phase
of
a
capital
trial
is
to
make
a
case
for
life.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
justice
scalia,
if
a
member
of
the
court
asked
a
question
of
counsel
and
counsel
stood
silent,
the
necessary
implication
of
that
is
i
have
no
good
reply
for
that
question.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
yes,
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
well,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
we
know
that
mr.
dice
was
suffering
from
mental
illness
at
the
time
he
testified.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
y-
your
honor,
i
think
e-
i
would
submit
that
that's
more
of
a
statement
of
grandiosity,
but
even
if
it
was
a
plea
for
mercy,
our
position
is
that
after
the
opening
statements,
nothing
happened
to
make
a
case
for
life.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
justice
breyer,
there
there're
two
points
in
response.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
okay.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
number
one,
your
honor,
it's
not
just
the
failure
to
make
a
statement.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
your
honor,
for
a
jury
who's
just
rejected
an
insanity
defense
and
this
will
justice
scalia,
this
plays
into
the
second
point,
too.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
justice
breyer,
ther-
the
problem
with
that
evidence
was
that
the
post
conviction
court
made
a
finding
there
was
prosecutorial
misconduct
where
the
prosecution
improperly
argued
that
the
jury
should
not
believe
the
evidence
with
respect
to
drug
usage.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
okay.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
hm.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
but
justice
kennedy,
at
least
then
the
jury
has
something
to
weigh.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
justice
breyer,
put
another
way,
the
question
the
court
is
asking
is
whether
or
not
a
lawyer
can
strategically
decide
to
abandon
advocacy.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
no,
justice
breyer.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
justice
souter,
it's
our
position
that,
in
essence,
the
lawyer's
judgments
are
irrelevant
to
a
cronic
analysis,
that
cronic
looks
at
the...
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
no,
justice...
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
justice
o'connor,
if
i
could
take
both
of
your
questions
in
the
order
you
presented
them.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
justice
o'connor,
the
if
strickland
did
apply,
the
twenty-two
fifty-four
d
question
could
not
be
resolved
until
first
the
procedural
default
issues
and
the
failure
to
afford
an
evidentiary
hearing
questions
are
resolved
by
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
okay.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
your
honor,
these
are
all
questions
that
apply
to
application
of
sixth
amendment,
the
failure
to
develop...
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
with
respect
to
the
penalty
phase
specifically,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
with
respect
to
developing
proof
as
to
deficient
performance,
why
the
findings
of
fact
should
not
be
trusted
because
ment-
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
e-
no
your
what
they
rejected,
there
was
a-
an
issue
of
waiver
of
certain
claims,
not
the
sixth
amendment
claims,
but
other
claims
that
was
denied
by
the
district
court,
and
the
sixth
circuit
found
that
those
issues
were
waived.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
no,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
because...
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
justice
scalia,
that
fits
right
into
this
court's
decision
with
michael
williams
versus
taylor.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
we
your
honor,
there's
several
different
issues,
justice
souter.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
chief
justice,
there's
several
facts,
starting
with
the
deficient
performance
aspect.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
because,
chief
justice,
many
of
the
findings
by
the
state
court
relied
on
the
testimony
of
john
dice,
and
just
like
under
the
old
townsend
versus
sain...
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
no,
your
honor,
but
it
also
comes
into
michael
williams
versus
taylor,
this
court's
two
thousand
term
two
th-
year
two
thousand
opinion,
where
if
it's
not
if
we
didn't
fail
to
develop
facts
in
in
state
court
that
are
relevant,
we
can
develop
them
in
federal
court.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
e-
justice
breyer,
with
respect
to
your
first
question,
we're
raising
the
fact
that
he
committed
suicide
after
the
post
conviction
testimony
so
that
that
imp-
that
qu-
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
justice
breyer,
he
failed
to
make
a
case
for
life.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
with
resp-
justice
souter,
there're
m-
many
cases
for
life
that
could
have
been
made.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
no,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
okay.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
of
the
capital...
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
n-
no,
your
your
honor,
there
were
some
references
by
mr.
dice's
testimony
that
he
thought
that
the
mother,
valeree
cone,
did
not
make
a
good
witness
and
that
generally
the
family
members
he
thought
did
not
make
a
good
witness.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
your
honor,
vera-
th-
th-
he
at-
when
he
tried
to
introduce
evidence
in
the
guilt
phase,
there
were
objections
as
to
relevancy
which
were
sustained
by
the
court,
because
the
court
found
that
all
that
was
relevant
in
the
guilt
phase
was
the
issue
of
mental
insanity.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
your
honor,
first
of
a-
this
case
was...
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
mr.
cone
was
thirty-three
in
nineteen-eighty-two,
so
that
would
make
him
fifty...
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
justice
scalia,
though
the
the
the
fact
of
the
matter
th-
is,
though,
that
mr.
cone
has
been
trying
to
develop
these...
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
your
honor,
that
should've
gone
in.
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
yes,
your
honor,
because
they
would...
mr.
robert
l.
hutton
your
honor,
those
should've
gone
in,
but
more
importantly,
those
should've
been
woven
into
an
argument
as
to
why
the
reasoned
moral
judgment
a
reasoned
moral
judgment
called
for
this
man
not
to
be
put
to
death.
