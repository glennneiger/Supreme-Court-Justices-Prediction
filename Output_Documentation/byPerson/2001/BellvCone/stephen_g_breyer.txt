w-
why
w-
th-
i'd
like
you
to
go
into
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
same
reaction
as
justice
ginsburg.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
on
that
part...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
paul
freund
sometimes
has
said,
a
lawyer
in
this
court
who
sits
down
saying
nothing
makes
not
just
a
good
argument,
but
a
perfect
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
reading
this
transcript
led
me
to
think
maybe
it
wasn't
the
perfect
response,
but
it
was
a
good
one,
because
in
the
introductory
statement
i'll
repeat
myself
he
made
all
his
arguments.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
says
the
defense
has
put
on
proof
of
those
mitigating
circumstances
during
its
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
go
to
i
don't
want
you
to
lose
two,
though.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
i
want
to
elicit
from
you
what
your
response
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah-
all
he
has...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
his
closing
statement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
what
is
the
particular
thing,
though,
because
i
mean,
you've
mentioned
three
times
now
that
he
has
some
mental
problem
that
led
him
to
commit
suicide.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
gather
that
must
have
been
at
least
four
or
five
years
after
these
events.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
testified
at
the
hearing
in
nineteen
eighty-six.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i've
seen
many
bad
cases
of
bad
representation
in
death
cases
that
i
think
is
terrible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
not
suggest
that
four
or
five
years
earlier
it
might
suggest
a
cause
of
bad
representation,
but
it
doesn't
suggest
there
was
the
bad
representation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
come
in
during
the
dur-
had
that
come
in
during
the
guilt
stage?
