mr.
moore,
i
think
what
happened
in
this
sentencing
proceeding,
if
i
remember
correctly,
is
that
the
attorney
made
some
remarks
at
the
beginning
of
the
sentencing
hearing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
explain
that
he
wouldn't
be
presenting
any
evidence
or
saying
anything
more?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
would
you
be
here
would
you
still
be
here
if
he
had
not
said
anything
at
the
opening?
then
what
rule
applies?
suppose
the
defense
attorney
just
totally
remained
silent
in
the
sentencing
phase.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
given
in
this
case
that
the
attorney
did
provide
that
there
was
ineffective
assistance
at
sentencing?
do
we
take
that
as
a
a
gi-
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
what
if
the
defense
counsel
presented
nothing
at
all
at
the
sentencing
phase,
do
you
think
that
there
is
potential
for
application
of
cronic
in
those
circumstances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
that
re-
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
he
did
say
something
initially,
did
he
not,
at
the
sentencing
phase?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
i
just
i
hope
you
will
address
that
because
if
he
actually
did
something
but
it
was
somehow
inadequate
assistance,
then
perhaps
strickland
is
the
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he
did
absolutely
nothing,
then
we
have
to
wrestle
with
whether
you
divide
it
from,
you
know,
sentencing
phase
from
guilt
innocence
phase,
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
whole
problem,
because
if
we
were
analyzing
it
under
strickland,
we
would
have
a
different
sort
of
inquiry,
and
maybe
it
fits
better
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
happen
then?
and
how
should
we
address
it
with
these
two
questions?
do
we
deal
with
twenty-two
fifty-four
first
as
a
threshold
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
know
i
i...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
h-
it
puts
you
in
a
bad
position
for
me
to
ask
you
this,
but
just
assume,
if
you
would
for
a
minute,
that
we
think
strickland
applies.
