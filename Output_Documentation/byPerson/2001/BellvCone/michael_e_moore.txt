mr.
michael
e.
moore
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
the
court
of
appeals
was
without
authority
to
grant
habeas
relief
under
twenty-eight
usc
twenty-two
fifty-four
d
one
on
respondent's
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
for
two
reasons:
first,
because
the
state
court
decision
rejecting
the
claim
correctly
identified
this
court's
decision
in
strickland
versus
washington
as
the
clearly
established
federal
law
governing
this
case,
not
united
states
versus
cronic
as
respondent
contends,
and
second,
because
the
state
court's
application
of
strickland
to
the
facts
of
respondent's
case
was
not
objectively
unreasonable.
turning
to
the
first
point,
respondent's
ineffective
assistance
claim
from
the
outset
of
this
case
has
asserted
two
specific
errors
that
his
attorney
allegedly
committed
during
the
sentencing
phase
of
his
capital
trial
first,
counsel's
alleged
failure
to
present
available
mitigating
evidence
and
second,
his
counsel's
decision
to
waive
closing
argument.
this
court
held
in
strickland
that
such
claims
are
properly
analyzed
under
the
two
part
actual
deficient
performance
slash
actual
prejudice
test
announced
in
that
case
itself.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
he
delivered
an
opening
statement,
during
which
he
specifically
called
the
jury's
attention,
as
he
is
permitted
to
do
under
tennessee
state
law,
to
guilt
phase
evidence,
mental
health
evidence,
upon
which
he
was
relying
in
mitigation.
he
explained
to
the
jury
its
mitigating
significance
by
relating
that
evidence
specifically
to
three
statutory
mitigating
factors.
in
addition,
during
that
opening
statement,
he
emphasized
his
client's
remorse
for
his
role
in
the
crimes.
he
emphasized
his
client's
honorable
service
for
his...
mr.
michael
e.
moore
country.
did
he...
mr.
michael
e.
moore
he
he
did
not
indicate
one
way
or
the
other
in
that
statement,
mr.
michael
e.
moore
[inaudible]
mr.
michael
e.
moore
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
claim
focuses
on
counsel's
conduct
during
the
trial
and
it
is
not
alleged
that
any
errors
or
omissions
he
made
were
the
result
of
state
interru-
interference
or
so
called
surrounding
circumstances,
then
such
a
claim
is
properly
analyzed
under
strickland's
two
part
test.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
indeed,
your
honor,
he
did.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
he
he
objected
to
some
hearsay
evidence.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
n-
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
cronic
in
our
view
is
properly
read
to
apply
only
when
surrounding
circumstances
or
state
interference
renders
it
unlikely
that
any
lawyer
could
have
re-
rendered
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
but
th-
that
circumstance
is
the
the
lawyer's
own
problem.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
no
your
honor
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
y-
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes,
your...
mr.
michael
e.
moore
well,
it's
our
it's
our
position,
your
honor,
that
it
is
not
the
function
of
this
court
under
twenty-two
fifty-four
d
to
reach
to
actually
address
the
merits
a-
as
if
it
were
deciding
this
claim
de
novo.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
i
certainly
would
not
b-
begrudge
the
court's
agreeing
that
the
state
court
had
indeed
correctly
applied
strickland.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
whether
it
is
reasonable.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
and
so,
i-
i-
in-
indeed,
counsel
could've
reasonably
believed
that
all
of
the
points
he
had
made
during
his
opening
statement,
his
plea
for
mercy,
his
emphasis
on
his
client's
remorse,
and
the
mitigating
significance
of
the
guilt
phase
evidence,
were
fresh
in
the
jury's
mind
when
the
jury
retired
to
deliberate
because...
mr.
michael
e.
moore
during
his
opening
statement,
he
did
not
specifically
mention
the
bronze
star
because
that
evidence
was
not
elicited
until
the
his
cross
examination
of
one
of
the
witnesses
during
the
sentencing
phase.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
he
did
not
mention
the
bronze
star.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
the
allegation
that
it
was
available
was
made
in
the
federal
proceeding,
but
there
was
no...
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
well,
i
don't
know
that
it
was
denied.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
b-
b-
because
the
burden
rests
with
the
petitioner,
the
habeas
petitioner,
to
demonstrate
its
existence.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
burger
versus
kemp.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
that's
right,
and
that
was
the...
mr.
michael
e.
moore
the
state
court
found,
based
on
the...
mr.
michael
e.
moore
presented
to
it
during
the
post
conviction
hearing
that
counsel
made
a
tactical
decision
to
waive
in
in
order
to
prevent
the
senior
prosecutor
from
delivering
what
he...
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
am
not
i
am
not
acquainted
with
general
strother,
so
i'm
not...
mr.
michael
e.
moore
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
the
record
simply
doesn't
reflect
whether
or
not
that
would've
been
the
case.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
your
honor,
i
th-
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i'm
not
certain
that
i
that
th-
hearsay
evidence
in
a
prison
record
is
the
best
evidence
of
that
fact.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
no,
your
honor,
mr.
michael
e.
moore
respondent
introduced
no
evidence
before
the
state
courts
concerning
why
th-
the
the
bronze
star
was
awarded,
anything
about
the
circumstances
of
its
award.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
not
so
insofar
as
this
record
reflects,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
during
sentencing?
no.
