justice

scalia
don't
you
think
it'd
be
a
little
coy
for
us
to
decide,
well,
it
wasn't
an
unreasonable
application
of
of
federal
law
when
we,
in
fact,
know
or
believe
that
it
was
a
correct
application
of
federal
law?
do
you
insist
that
we
simply
say
and
go
no
further
than
to
say,
oh,
it
was
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
er
application?
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
if
we
could
go
no
further
than
than
the
coy
statement
that
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
application,
i
suppose
you
shouldn't've
had
two
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
moore,
er
are
you
done
with
that
point?
i...
justice
antonin
scalia
i-
it
isn't
stated
in
your
brief,
but
i
assume
that
it's
it's
it's
the
tennessee
rule
that
if
if
the
defense
doesn't
make
a
closing
a
closing
statement,
the
prosecution
doesn't
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
fearsome
mr.
strother.
justice
antonin
scalia
gather
that
this
isn't
the
only
occasion
on
which
defense
counsel
have
esch-
eschewed
the
making
of
closing
argument
for
fear
that
mr.
strother
would
be
enabled
to
unleash
his
his
weaponry.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
divide
trial
into,
you
know,
the
one
phase
and
then
the
the
mitigation
phase?
it's
all
part
of
the
same
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel
utterly
failed
to
to
litigate
this
particular
piece.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
justification
do
you
have
for
for
separating
out
the
mitigation
phase
from
the
other,
especially
when
some
of
the
evidence
that
went
to
mitigation
was
presented
during
during
the
direct
phase?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
giving
up
the
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
be
th-
th-
here's
a
counsel
who
litigated
the
case
properly
but
he
made
he
made
a
mistake
in
in
in
his
litigation?
he
didn't
put
on
any
evidence
in
the
in
the
mitigation
phase.
justice
antonin
scalia
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
penalty
phase?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means
the
two
phases
are
linked.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
really
bad
performance,
you
can
argue,
having
especially
having
made
that
statement,
not
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that
it
proves
that
he
wasn't
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
w-
we
have
counsel
up
here
sometimes
who
say
i
i
waive
rebuttal.
justice
antonin
scalia
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
allude
to
that
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
surely
the
jury
would
assume
that
they
could
consider
it
if
he
referred
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
m-
i
i
i
don't
i
don't
really
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
why
we
can't
just
just
look
at
the
evidence
that
was
available
and
and
decide
the
the
strickland
question
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
send
th-
th-
th-
this
conviction
and
sentence
occurred
in
nineteen
eighty-two.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
old
is
is
is
mr.
cone?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
well,
fifty-thr-
he
may
he
may
get
a...
justice
antonin
scalia
life
sentence
by
default.
