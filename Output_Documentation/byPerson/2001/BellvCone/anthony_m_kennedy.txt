j-
just
to
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
suppose
the
attorney
says
nothing
and
la-
later
says,
y-
you
know,
i
was
just
i
don't
know
stressed
out,
traumatized.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
does
cronic
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
my
hy-
in
my
hypothetical,
i
said
he
he
said
i
just
blanked
out
for
a
minute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
not
the
first
time
in
one
of
these
cases
i've
been
surprised
at
how
skimpy
the
presentation
is
at
by
the
defense
counsel
on
sentencing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
tempted
to
ask
you
if
i-
if
this
is
usual,
but
th-
th-
that
that's
probably
not
a
fair
question
is
it
there're
so
many
differences
in
so
many
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
what
was
the
bas-
what
was
the
case
you
just
cited
to
us
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
burger
versus
kemp
if
the
district
court
in
this
case
had
wanted
to
inquire
about
the
availability
of
other
evidence,
it
was
precluded
from
doing
so
because
it
hadn't
been
introduced
in
the
state
collateral
proceedings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
procedural
bar
rule
if
the
evidence
is
not
adduced
at
the
state
collateral
proceeding,
as
opposed
to
federal
deference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
just
the
failure
to
adduce
the
to
to
make
the
claim
rather
than
to
elicit
the
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
had
he
had
asked
questions
on
cross
examination,
and
it
may
be
that
he
was
satisfied
that
the
state
hadn't
shown
much.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
going
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
have
some
stem
winder
and
and
and
this
is
not
standard
but
it
is
is
it
is
not
an
unknown
strategy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
very
effective
strategy
for
that
particular
advocate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
it
implies
to
the
jury
that
the
state
has
shown
nothing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
completely
permissible
inference,
and
counsel
does
that
has
been
known
to
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
i,
you
know,
i
have
trouble
with
that
because
i
don't
think
the
state
put
on
very
much,
and
if
i'm
sitting
waiting
for
this
closing
argument,
i
know
what
i'm
going
to
hear.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
the
prosecutor
says,
this
man
with
a
bronze
star
killed
a
helpless,
innocent
couple.
