[ns]
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
the
united
states
has
addressed
the
second
question
presented,
which
is
whether
a
defendant
must
show
prejudice
to
establish
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
to
assume
then
that
the
performance
was
deficient
and
then
address
the
prejudice
prong?
no.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
you
get
to
you
can
ge-
you
get
to
question
two
if,
in
determining
that
strickland
and
not
cronic
is
the
clearly
established
law,
this
court
holds
that
cronic
does
not
apply
when
the
claim
is
an
actual
ineffective
assistance
claim.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
we
do
but
our
difference
is
very
narrow.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
okay,
and
we
couldn't
agree
with
you
more.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
we
don't
think...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
we
don't
think
so.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
we
would
be
talking
about
a
penalty
phase
although
i
agree
with
justice
scalia
that
in
the
unique
situation
of
this
case,
where
there's
an
express
procedure
that
allows
the
jury
to
consider
the
mitigation
evidence,
it's
critical
to
look
at
counsel's
performance
during
the
g-
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
unique
and
i
i'm
sorry
i...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right,
and
if
you
d-
if
we're
just
talking
if
you
take
it
out
of
the
capital
proceeding
so
you
don't
have
the
split
trial,
all
we're
saying
is
if
there's
an
entire
failure,
we
would
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
presume
prejudice.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
i
think
that's
correct,
and
however
you
draw
the
line,
this
case
falls
on
the
strickland
side
of
the
line
because
this
is
not
a
case
where
counsel
didn't
do
anything.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
it
would
be
under
strickland.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
is
counsel's
j-
things
that
would
go
to
impair
counsel
judgments
or
generally
irrelevant
unless
they
manifest
themself
manifest
themselves
in
objectively
unreasonable
conduct.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
that's
right.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
ye-
the
district
court
ruled
that
that
that
those
claims
were
procedurally
barred
under
an
adequate
and
independent
state
procedure.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
in
this
context,
the
claims
were
not
made
until
subsequent
post
conviction
state
court
proceedings.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
