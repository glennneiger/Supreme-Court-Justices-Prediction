do
we
have
any
evidence
to
indicate
whether
mr.
dice
would
have
put
on
evidence
showing
the
bronze
star
if
he
had
not
been
able
to
bring
it
out
in
cross
examination?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
mr.
hutton,
the
problem
that
i
think
we're
all
having
with
your
argument
i-
is
is
illustrated
by
the
the
colloquy
that
keeps
going
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
any
indiction
here
as
to
whose
fault
it
was?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
with
this?
and
i
because
i
think
we're
all
trying
to
get
at
the
same
thing.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
when
you
go
back
to
that,
what
is
it
that
you
that
you
say
should
have
gone
in
as
evidence
at
the
sentencing
phase
that
didn't?
the
bronze
star.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
what
about
the
other
two
that
i
mentioned,
the
the
the
death
of
the
sister
and
the
murder
of
of
the
the
the
the
girlfriend?
should
those
things
have
gone
in?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
pushing
you
because
your
time
is
running
out.
