justice
john
paul
stevens
what
did
he
say
about
the
bronze
star?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
your
answer
is
he
didn't
mention
it
in
his
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
am
i
right
that
such
evidence
was
introduced
in
the
federal
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
such
evidence
was
available
made
in
the
federal
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
allegation
denied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
we're
not
deciding
the
case
on
the
basis
of
what
that
evidence
would
prove
or
disprove,
but
rather
on
whether
counsel
was
deficient
in
failing
to
introduce
it,
should
we
not
assume
the
evidence
exists?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
he
was
entitled
to
be
pleased
with
himself
for
the
way
he
got
that
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
that
the
way
you
would
have
done
it
if
you'd
been
the
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
all
the
jury
found
out
about
it,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
did
the
lawyer
put
in
any
evidence
about
his
what
kind
of
a
person
he
was
before
he
went
to
vietnam?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask?
supposing
you
had
a
case
and
i
know
this
is
not
quite
it
in
which
there
is
strong
evidence
that
counsel
was
mentally
disabled
and
that
that
made
him
less
effective
throughout
the
entire
sentencing
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
severe
mental
illness
on
the
part
of
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
treat
the
failure
to
make
a
closing
statement
or
the
failure
to
put
in
any
evidence
whatsoever
e-
e-
exactly
as
if
he
were
a
fully
qualified
lawyer
in
such
a
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
ask
you
one
question
following
up
on
justice
souter?
he
listed
three
things.
