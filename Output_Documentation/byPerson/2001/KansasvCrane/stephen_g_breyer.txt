there
i
thought
there
could
be
cognitive
impairments.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
think
justice
scalia
has
described
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
be
volitional
impairments.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
relevant
here
other
than
volition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
one
relevant
to
the
particular
individual
at
issue
here
other
than
volition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
the
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
what
that's
the
problem
in
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
the
right
definition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
definition
of
the
word,
mental
disorder,
that
appears
in
the
statute?
if
a
person
were
to
say
every
person
who
commits
a
crime,
fifteen
times
running,
is
a
sociopath
and
thereby
falls
within
dsm
four,
you're
not
going
to
permit
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
mental
disorder.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
american
psychiatric
association
says
in
their
brief
that
the,
quote,
antisocial
personality
disorder,
end
quote,
which
is
dsm
four
at
seven
oh
one
seven
oh
six,
there
applies
to
forty
to
sixty
percent
among
the
male-sentenced
population.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
i
don't
know
if
they
know...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
know
better
than
i
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
dsm
four
the
standard
and
if
dsm
four
is
not
the
standard,
what
is?
that's
what
i
think
all
of
us,
or
several
of
us
anyway,
are
trying
to
get
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is,
imagine
i'm
talking
about
the
set
of
people
who
are
very
dangerous.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
what
about
a
person
who
thinks
other
people
are
mo-
are
like
rocks?
you
know?
i
mean,
he
can
control
himself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
dangerous
because
he's
autistic
or
has
no
sense
whatsoever
of
what
a
feeling
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
it
with
control
because
control
has
to
do
with
volition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
perfectly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
court
has
grievously
said
that
the
constitution
permits
the
civil
commitment
of
a
dangerous
sexual
offender
where
first,
the
state
applying
proper
procedures;
second,
determines
that
offender
remained
dangerous;
and
third,
as
a
result
of
a
mental
illness
or
abnormality.
in
this
case,
which
arises
under
kansas
sexually
violent
predator
act,
we
assumed
that
the
procedures
are
proper
and
that
the
offender
is
dangerous,
but
what
does
the
constitution
require
kansas
in
order
to
show
that
it
is
a
mental
illness
or
abnormality,
rather
than
say,
ordinary
criminal
propensities
that
make
the
sexual
offender
dangerous.
we
previously
considered
the
same
act
in
kansas
versus
hendricks,
and
in
that
case,
we
said
that
the
offenderâ€™s
inability
to
control
his
behavior
satisfied
any
kind
of
constitutional
due
process
requirements.
in
this
case,
the
state
of
kansas
says
that
the
kansas
supreme
court
reading
our
prior
opinion
in
hendricks
thought
it
meant
that
the
state
had
to
show
he
could
not
control
his
behavior
at
all,
and
kansas
adds
that
is
far
too
strict
to
constitutional
interpretation
that
is
not
what
we
said.
we
agree
with
kansas
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
a
state
when
it
wants
to
commit
civilly
a
dangerous
sexual
offender
to
show
that
the
offender
is
totally
unable
to
control
his
sexually
dangerous
behavior,
but
we
do
not
agree
with
the
state
in
so
far
as
it
seems
to
claim
that
the
constitution
would
permit
this
kind
of
civil
commitment
without
any
lack
of
control
requirement.
rather,
in
our
view
the
constitution
requires
the
state
to
demonstrate
a
serious
difficulty
in
controlling
behavior
and
that
difficulty
when
viewed
in
light
of,
for
example
the
nature
of
the
psychiatric
diagnosis
and
the
severity
of
the
mental
abnormality
itself
must
distinguish
the
dangerous
offender
whose
serious
mental
abnormality
or
illness
or
disorder
subjects
him
to
civil
commitment.
it
must
distinguish
that
kind
of
a
person
from
a
dangerous
but
typical
criminal
recidivist
convicted
in
an
ordinary
criminal
case.
we
recognize
that
this
standard
does
not
draw
a
mathematically
precised
bright
line,
but
the
constitution
safeguards
in
the
area
of
mental
illness
are
not
always
best
enforced
through
bright
lines.
such
lines
do
not
take
into
account
the
definitional
leeway
that
the
constitution
grants
the
states,
nor
do
they
take
into
account
the
relationship
between
law
and
psychiatric,
a
science
that
must
inform
though
it
cannot
control
the
ultimate
legal
determination.
a
science
that
makes
judgments
and
distinctions
that
are
related
to
that
which
do
not
precisely
mirror
legal
distinctions
and
which
is
a
science
that
changes
or
evolves
as
it
advances.
consequently,
we
have
tried
to
provide
constitutional
guidance
in
this
area
both
here
and
in
our
earlier
case
hendricks
by
proceeding
deliberately
and
contextually
elaborating
the
general
constitutional
standards
and
objectives
as
circumstances
require.
the
state
also
argues
that
the
kansas
supreme
court
wrongly
limited
the
class
of
individuals
that
the
constitution
permits
it
civilly
to
commit
under
this
act
to
those
suffering
from
volitional
defects
that
we
ruled
out
commitment
of
those
suffering
from
emotional
or
cognitive
illnesses.
this
court
has
not
previously
used
those
particular
contexts
when
it
has
tried
to
make
concepts
when
it
has
tried
to
make
constitutional
distinction.
we
did
not
consider
in
hendricks
whether
the
constitution
would
permit
civil
confinement
of
the
dangerous
sexual
offender
whose
illness
or
abnormality
was
solely
emotional
rather
volitional
and
the
case
before
us
does
not
give
us
an
opportunity
to
decide
that
either.
consequently,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
kansas
supreme
court
and
we
remand
for
further
proceeding.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
