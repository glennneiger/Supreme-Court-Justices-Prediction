justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
take
it
what
your
what
your
statute
is
trying
to
get
at
is
is
something
more
than
mere
repetitive
conduct,
mere
recidivism.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
and
is
the
element
that
distinguishes
this
kind
of
behavior
from
mere
repetitiveness
some
element
of
lack
of
control,
not
necessarily
volitional
control,
but
some
element
of
lack
of
control,
perhaps
lack
of
control
resulting
from
delusion,
perceptual
difficulties
and
so
on,
but
but
some
some
aspect
of
the
personality
that
that
gives
that
individual
a
a
a
a
a
lesser
chance
of
controlling
behavior
in
in
a
way
that
avoids
committing
crimes.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
what
i'm
i
guess
what
i'm
getting
at
is
it
it
seems
sensible
to
call
somebody
who
is
just
an
habitual
offender
at
some
dangerous
crime
or
serious
crime
dangerous.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
it
about
them
that
we
can
isolate
that
shows
that
they
are
really
serious
beyond
the
mere
repetition
of
their
crime?
in
other
words,
let
me
put
the
question
this
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
and...
justice
david
h.
souter
justice
ginsburg's
question,
which
which
which
is
very
much
like
justice
o'connor's.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
that
in
the
example
justice
ginsburg
gave
you
what
was
it
four
out
of
seven
in
the
list?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
is
as
long
as
as
the
the
the
expert
witness
says,
yes,
this
person
i-
is
subject
to
four
out
of
those
those
seven
characters
they
personality
traits,
that
that
person,
if
a
sexual
offender,
could
be
locked
up
under
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
it
it
would
be
on
justice
ginsburg's
example,
it
would
be
very
easy
to
prove.
justice
david
h.
souter
to
show
any
other
kind
of
impairment
in
addition
to
the
two
elements
that
you're
describing.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
deo-
disorder
does
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
say
emotional
is,
and
and
and
i
guess
em-
emotional
impairment
i
suppose
would
describe
e-
every
sociopath
in
the
country.
justice
david
h.
souter
satisfy
as
an
emotional
impairment,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
i
think
we
get
back
to
the
point
that
on
your
theory
any
sociopath
who
has
committed
a
a
sexual
offense
can
be
committed
under
this
statute
upon
release.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would
take
four
out
of
seven
on
justice
ginsburg's
list.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
a
jury
instruction
were
couched
in
the
terms
that
justice
scalia
just
quoted,
as
stating
the
holding
in
hendricks,
would
you
find
that
jury
instruction
correct
and
satisfactory?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
it
be
would
it
be
constitutionally
erroneous?
would
you
be...
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
we...
justice
david
h.
souter
in
hendricks.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
if
justice
scalia's
quotations
correctly
stated
the
holding
in
hendricks,
i
think
you
are
telling
us
we
have
got
to
draw
back
from
hendricks.
