we
also
relied
on
prior
authority
that
made
some
reference
to
lack
of
control.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
think
that's
the
standard
adopted
in
the
court
below
that
we're
reviewing?
justice
sandra

o'connor
total
impairment?
justice
sandra

o'connor
have
here
we
have
we
have
here
an
antisocial
personality
disorder.
justice
sandra

o'connor
and
the
state's
own
expert
said
in
mr.
crane's
trial
that
approximately
seventy-five
percent
of
the
prison
population
has
antisocial
personality
disorder.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
trying...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
most
of
them,
seventy-five
percent
of
them,
was
the
testimony,
suffer
from
antisocial
personality
disorder.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
have
thought,
really,
that
that
is
not
what
we
limited
it
to
in
hendricks,
that
a
delusional
lack
of
control
would
be
entirely
sufficient
constitutionally
as
a
ha-
as
it
relates
to
a
lack
of
control,
that
it
could
be
volitional
or
delusional,
that
the
kansas
court
went
too
far
in
requiring
only
volitional
as
a
constitutional
standard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
the
kansas
supreme
court
went
too
far.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
kansas
supreme
court
appeared
to
hold
that
a
person
must
be
completely
unable
to
control
his
behavior
in
order
to
meet
what
it
thought
the
constitutional
standard
is
under
the
due
process
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
hm?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
think
i
do.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
