do
you
have
that
you're
mentioning,
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
personality
disorder
and
they
say
pick
three
out
of
a
list
of
seven,
you
could
pick
out
habitually
doesn't
work,
doesn't
pay
debts,
is
reckless,
irritable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
prosecutor
then,
and
but
i
mean,
that's
not
something
that
that
we
would
generally
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
kennedy
brought
up
in
in
hendricks
a
concern,
and
this
case
seems
to
fit
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
entered
a
plea
bargain.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
is
a
civil
proceeding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
still,
you
could
you
could
get
to
where
you
were
or
even
beyond.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
those
three
things
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
definition
doesn't
say
trait.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
prosecutor
says,
dcm,
this
category
fits,
antisocial
personality
disorder,
any
three
of
and
i
just
gave
you
three
from...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
stovall,
you
have
read
hendricks,
as
all
of
us
have.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
kansas
supreme
court
quote
the
very
words
from
hendricks
that
justice
scalia
re-
referred
to
before
to
make
this
a
finding
by
linking
future
dangerousness
to
a
mental
abnormamality,
[:abnormality]
a
personality
disorder,
that
makes
it
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
control
his
behavior?
that's
what
the
kansas
supreme
court
repeated.
