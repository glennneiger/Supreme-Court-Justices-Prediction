mr.
john
c.
donham
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
the
major
disagreement
between
the
state
state's
view
of
this
and
mr.
crane's
view
is
not
how
dangerous
is
an
individual,
but
why
are
they
dangerous.
mr.
john
c.
donham
i'm
sorry,
judge.
mr.
john
c.
donham
mr.
crane
sought
a
jury
instruction
at
his
trial
that
was
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
hendricks.
mr.
john
c.
donham
your
your
honor,
in
the
kansas
statute
itself.
mr.
john
c.
donham
your
honor,
joi-
joint
appendix
excuse
me.
mr.
john
c.
donham
no.
mr.
john
c.
donham
i
agree
with
that,
and
and
may
i
may
i
follow
that
up
with
perhaps
the
kansas
sexual
predator
act
has
a
number
of
subsections,
one
of
which
is
directly
directly
focused
on
the
type
of
individual
you
just
mentioned
in
your
hypothetical.
mr.
john
c.
donham
your
honor,
in
the
definition
of
a
th-
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
c.
donham
your
honor,
it's
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
c.
donham
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
c.
donham
your
honor,
th-
this
the
facts
of
the
crane
case
dealt
specifically
with
mr.
crane
and
mr.
crane
alone
.
mr.
john
c.
donham
that's
what
the
kansas
supreme
court
said.
mr.
john
c.
donham
your
honor,
if
if
i
have
to
fault
the
opinion
in
the
kan-
of
the
kansas
supreme
court
is
it
is
that
it
expanded
its
decision
that
was
directly
for
mr.
crane
under
the
specific
subsection
of
the
kansas
sexual
predator
act
that
dealt
with
individuals
who
had
been
found
criminally
responsible.
mr.
john
c.
donham
your
honor,
as
as
i
read
hendricks
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
kansas
act
is
constitutional
because,
as
with
mr.
hendricks,
what
it
determined
was
that
the
state
was
not
seeking
to
involuntarily
commit
people
based
on
dangerousness
alone,
which
would
have
been
absolutely
unconstitutional
under
foucha
versus
louisiana.
mr.
john
c.
donham
the
th-
i
think
the
exact
language
of
the
kansas
statute,
or
at
least
of
mr.
hendricks
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
c.
donham
[inaudible]
mr.
john
c.
donham
well,
when
mr.
hendricks
professed
that
he
could
not
control
his
behavior,
that's
an
indication
that
when
confronted
with
temptation,
he
was
unable
to
exercise
his
free
will.
mr.
john
c.
donham
your
honor,
i'm
not
trying
to
limit
the
what
a
psychiatrist
or
a
psychologist
might
be
able
to
say
affects
abili-
the
ability
of
an
individual
to
conform
his
behavior
to
society's
requirements.
mr.
john
c.
donham
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
john
c.
donham
i
i-
i
agree
with
that
and
i
hope
i
haven't
misled
the
court.
mr.
john
c.
donham
i
agree
that
they
perhaps
imposed
too
strict
a
limits
on
these
additional
elements
that
have
to
be
found
in
order
to
involuntarily
commit...
mr.
john
c.
donham
your
honor,
th-
to
the
first
part
of
your
question,
the
only
available
argument
that
we
could
have
made,
the
only
conceivable
jury
instruction
that
would
have
been
consistent
with
the
contradictory
evidence
at
trial
and
this
court's
opinion
in
hendricks
was
a
a
demand
for
a
jury
instruction,
requiring
the
jury
to
find
that
it
was
his
mental
abnormality
or
his
personality
disorder
that
made
him
be
likely
to
reoffend
because
it
interfered
with
his
ability
to
control
his
behavior.
mr.
john
c.
donham
your
honor,
i
i
know
the
state
has
touted
the
the
descriptive
adjective
adequate
control.
mr.
john
c.
donham
your
honor,
as
as
i
read
the
the
kansas
statute,
the
legislative
body
intended
that
the
mental
defect
cause
the
individual
to
be
likely
to
commit
future
predatory
acts
of
violence.
mr.
john
c.
donham
yes,
and
this
court...
mr.
john
c.
donham
i-
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
john
c.
donham
we
did
object
to
the
jury
instruction
because
we
felt
it
did
not
adequately
address
the
theme
that
the
state
carried
to
the
jury
.
mr.
john
c.
donham
yes,
sir,
i
did.
mr.
john
c.
donham
i'm
s-
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
c.
donham
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
donham
what
i
said,
your
honor,
is
that
the
statute
requires
that
an
individual
susceptible
to
being
involuntarily
committed
must
have
a
mental
illness
that
makes
him
or
her
likely
to...
mr.
john
c.
donham
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
donham
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
john
c.
donham
it-
mr.
john
c.
donham
your
honor,
i
suppose
the
difference
may
lie
in-
in-
in
what
is
meant
by
total
or
absolute
lack
of
control.
mr.
john
c.
donham
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
c.
donham
some
of
these
terms
are-
are
pretty
slippery,
and,
of
course,
they're
all
taken
in
context
of
what
does-
does
a
does
a
psychiatrist
mean
by
them.
mr.
john
c.
donham
[inaudible]
mr.
john
c.
donham
no.
mr.
john
c.
donham
an-
and
by
doing
that,
it
in
essence,
if
you
will,
limited
the
application
of
the
act.
mr.
john
c.
donham
if
i
were
to
write
the
instruction,
it
would
have
read
it-
it
is
a
acquired
or
congenital
condition
that
affects
the
emotional
or
volitional
capacity
to
the
degree
that
the
person
is
unable
to
exercise
self-control.
mr.
john
c.
donham
well,
if
he's
dangerous...
mr.
john
c.
donham
i
would-
i
would
say
that
he's
an
appropriate
candidate
for
an
involuntary
commitment...
mr.
john
c.
donham
that
he
would
be...
mr.
john
c.
donham
this
would
be
a
person
susceptible
to
commitment
because
he's
unable
to
care
for
himself,
and
therefore
poses...
mr.
john
c.
donham
yes,
it
is.
