do
you
acknowledge
that
lack
of
ability
to
control
one's
unlawful
conduct
and
volitional
impairment
are
one
and
the
same
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i'm
delusional
and
and
i
think
that
that
people
i
see
are
satan.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
call
that
a
lack
of
volitional
control
or
d-
or
delusion?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
a...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
have
to
find
in
order
to
release
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
no
longer
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that...
justice
antonin
scalia
they
know?
i
i
i've
you
know,
i
could
pull...
justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
say
that
forty
to
sixty
percent
are
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
suffering
from
a
an
antisocial
personality
disorder?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
controlling,
not
not
utter
inability
to
control
conduct,
but
difficulty
in
controlling
conduct.
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
the
person
be
dangerous...
justice
antonin
scalia
reason
of
the
personality
disorder
if
the
personality
disorder
does
not
produce
a
difficulty
in
pr-
in
controlling
conduct?
justice
antonin
scalia
thought
i
thought
you
conceded
that
you
have
to
show
difficulty
in
controlling
conduct,
and
if
you
don't,
this
is
a
quite
different
case
from
what
i
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
antonin
scalia
holding
was,
indeed,
described
differently.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
the
crux
of
the
holding
of
the
case
and
that
portion
does
not
say
anything
about
volitional
impairment,
just
inability
or
difficulty
in
controlling
behavior.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
you
say
we
have
you
you
say
we
have
to
draw
back
from
that
sta-
but
what
what
in
that
statement
is
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statement...
justice
antonin
scalia
it
requires
a
finding
of
future
dangerousness
and
links
that
finding
to
the
existence
of
a
mental
abnormality
or
personality
disorder
that
makes
it
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
for
the
person
to
control
his
dangerous
behavior.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
what
is
wrong
in
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
are
they
future
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
first
page
of
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
talking
about
the
instruct-
talking
about
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
a
recidivist
who
will
be
a
recidivist
because
he's
delusional
and
he
thinks
that
every
woman
he
meets
is
inviting
crude
sexual
behavior
he's
fully
able
to
control
himself
if
he
doesn't
think
that
the
woman
is
inviting
crude
sexual
behavior,
but
he
happens
to
think
that
every
woman
he
meets
is
inviting
him,
and
he
would
not
be
covered
because
that
is
not
a
volitional
impairment.
justice
antonin
scalia
here
was
not
that
the
act
didn't
cover
your
client,
but
you're
you're
supporting
the
holding
of
the
kansas
supreme
court
that
the
act
does
cover
your
client,
but
inasmuch
as
insofar
as
it
does,
it's
unconstitutional
if
it
goes
beyond
volitional
impairment.
justice
antonin
scalia
ca-
ca-
can-
can
i
just
--
i
really
don't
know
what
we
have
before
us
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
th-
which
limiting
factor
was
difficulty
or
impossibility
of
controlling
behavior
.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
read
th-
i
just
read
the
portion
of
the
of
the
opinion
that
i
think
the
most
relevent
in
what
it
says
is
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
control
behavior.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
they
seemed
to
say
that
if
there's
no
volitional
impairment,
there
cannot
be
this
difficulty
or
impossibility
of
controlling
behavior.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i-
i
don't
i
really
don't
understand
where
we
are
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
kansas
supreme
court
didn't
think
it
was
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
have
to
prove
the
causality.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
not
properly
instructed
i-
not
because
it
was
not
instructed
in
accordance
with
the
kansas
statute,
but
because
if
it
had
been
instructed
in
accordance
with
the
kansas
statute,
that
would
have
been
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
it
says,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
psychiatrists
or
psychologists
either.
