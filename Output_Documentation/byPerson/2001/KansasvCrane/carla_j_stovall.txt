ms.
carla
j.
stovall
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
kansas
supreme
court
has
erroneously
read
this
court's
decision
in
kansas
v
hendricks
as
requiring
a
showing
that
a
potentially
sexually
violent
predator
cannot
control
his
behavior
and
that
such
a
requirement
has
supplemented
the
two
requisites
for
civil
commitment
that
this
court
has
approved
in
and
since
the
addington
case.
those
two
requirements,
as
you
know,
are
mental
illness
and
dangerousness.
the
volitional
impairment
that
the
kansas
supreme
court
has
ruled
was
constitutionally
required
for
civil
commitment
ignores
the
fact
that
psychological
disorders,
such
as
antisocial
personality,
can
impair
an
individual
in
behavior,
cognitive,
perceptual,
emotional,
and
even
intellectual
capacities.
this
court
has
never
indicated
that
there's
anything
constitutionally
significant
about
a
volitional
impairment.
[inaudible]
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i'm
saying
it
was
descriptive.
mr.
hendricks
had
apparently,
and
according
to
himself
only,
an
inability
to
control
his
own
behavior.
and
so,
when
the
majority
wrote
about
mr.
hendricks,
they
used
that
kind
of
a...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
description.
well,
but...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
well,
if
this
court
says
that
there
needs
to
be
some
volitional
impairment
displayed,
we
would
suggest
that
it
just
be
merely
some
impairment.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
do.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
do.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
no,
i
do
not.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
your
honor,
that's...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
would
consider
that
delusional
and
not
a
va-
a
lack
of
volitional
control
and
the
problem
with
the
kansas
supreme
court's
decision
is
that
it
says
the
only
thing
that
we
consider
is
volitional
impairment,
but
there
are
many
kinds
of
impairments
individuals
have
that
are
the
result
of
their
mental
disorder,
and
so
the
kansas
court
is
necessarily
limiting
the
psychiatric
diagnosis
to
say
only
volitional...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
perceptual,
intellectual.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
yes.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
all
of
those
that
we
mentioned,
and
perhaps
even...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
not...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
don't
believe
psychiatrists
can
tell
us
what
it
is
that
what
kind
of
impairment
mr.
crane
has.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i'm
certainly
not
saying
you
were
wrong,
your
honor.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
there
wasn't
evidence
before
this
court
that
would
say
whether
or
not
hendricks
suffered
from
a
volitional
impairment
or
not.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
\noise>
it
is
because
mr.
hendricks,
in
particular,
didn't
suffer
from
a
personality
disorder.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
well,
the
kansas
court
seems
to
think
there
is
because
there
is
no
definition
in
the
statute
of
a
personality
disorder.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
no,
your
honor.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
based
on
the
kansas
supreme
court
decision
or
based
on
the...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
we
believe
there
is
no
distinction.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
right.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
wha-
what
what
i
want
to
be
able
to
do
today,
your
honors,
is
to
convince
you
that
actually
that's
not
true,
that
an
antisocial
personality
disorder
is
a
severe
mental
pathology
that
really
does
give
us
sociopaths
and
psychopaths
that
cannot
conform
to
our
rules.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
absolutely.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
with
a
slight
exception.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
want
to
be
clear
that
we
don't
think
there
needs
to
be
a
a
third
separate,
very
distinguishable
constitutional
element...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
that's
hundred
percent
accurate.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
that
they
have
to
have
a
mental...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
what
is
in
the
statute,
a...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
believe
they
are
there
now,
that...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
well,
actually
it's
mental
abnormality
and...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
you
and
this
court
in
the
hendricks
decision
said
that
pedophilia
certainly
qualifies...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
that's
right.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
and
the
mental...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
what
okay
okay...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
there
doesn't
need
to
be
an
additional
element.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
suffers
from
that
in
the
deposition,
he
wasn't
he
he
certainly
didn't
quote
empirical
studies
to
demonstrate
that.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
we
have
to
show
a
mental
illness.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
and
that's
a
psychiatrically-approved
condition
that...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
right.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
the
actual
diagnosis
that
those
folks
actually
have
those
diagnosis
and
are
sexually
violent.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
three
of
seven.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
they
could
be
committed
for
treatment
under
this
this
statute,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
and
mr.
crane
for
what
what
i
would
want
you
to
know,
though,
is
that
it
is
not
a
circu-
just
because
these
individuals
have
committed
crimes
doesn't
mean
they
have
an
antisocial
personality
disorder.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
it
could
be
if
they
actually
have
that
diagnosis
and
have
those
personality
traits
and
have
done
that
behavior.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
understand.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i'm
sorry?
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
it
is,
but
we
have
that
higher
standard.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
it's
indefinite
with
annual
reviews,
and
they
are
allowed
to
be
released
when
they
have
been
determined
safe
to
be
at
large.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
yes.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
it...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
then
it's
part
the
state
has
to
show
th-
i'm
sorry.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
happened
in
the
six
so
far
that
that
have
have
been
released.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
in
terms
of
the
antisocial
personality
disorder
alone,
i
don't
know.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
percent...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
doubt
that,
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
the
dsm
absolutely
is
the
standard
in
the
psychiatric
profession,
but
it
is
not
the
bible
and
is
not
the
only
thing
psychiatrists
use.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
the
last,
that
it's
irrelevant
to
a
diagnosis.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
that
that
is...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
in
order
to
get
a
diag-
in
terms
of
the
instructions,
that's
true
because
to
get
a
diagnosis,
you
have
to
have
an
impairment.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
don't
believe
we
have
to
show
that.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
because...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
in
o-
in
order
to
link...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
and
i
i
misspoke,
your
honor.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
the
mental
abnormality
is
defined
in
the
statute
and
it
does
mention
both
volitional
and
emotional...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
it
is
not
defined
and
i
think
that's
because
it's
such
a
common
term,
the
legislature
didn't
defined
it.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
that
is
absolutely...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
it
is
an
emotional
impairment,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
kansas...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
but
it
takes
more
than
having
the
likelihood
of
committing
more
sex
crimes
and
or
not
having
any
empathy
before
you
could
be
diagnosed
with
an
antisocial
personality
disorder.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
it
takes
three,
actually...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
but
it
does
make
a
significant
diagnosis.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
again,
your
honor,
you're
exactly
right.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
would
suggest
to
you
that's
part
of
the
evaluative
process
of
a
psychologist
then
in
saying
this
is
someone
who
is
likely
to
continue
to
be
sexually...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
that
doesn't
mean
that
one
of
the
experts
would
say
that
makes
them
fit
under
this
law
to
be
sexually
violent
predators.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
am
because
i
don't
believe
that
was
central
or
necessary
to
the
holding.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
what
and
what
i
would
suggest
to
you
is
on
page
three
sixty
of
bec-
of
the
opinion,
it
becomes
very
clear
the
way
that
that
phrase
and
those
phrases
were
being
used.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
would
find
it
u-
longer
than
it
needed
to
be
and
more
inclusive
than
it
needed
to
be
because...
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
yes.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
my
view
is
that
what
you
said
in
hendricks
was
mental
illness
that
makes
somebody
dangerous
in
sexually
violent
ways.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
again,
what
i'm
saying,
the
mental
illness
makes
them
likely
to
re-offend
in
sexually
violent
ways.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
that
that
we
have
to
requir-
that
we
have
to
show
the
the
difficulty
of
maintaining
their
behavior,
of
of
controlling
their
behavior.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
yeah.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
only
that
i-
if
if
we
have
to
require
the
finding
of
that
makes
it
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
for
them
to
control
their
behavior.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
it's
it's
because
they're
they
have
a
mental
abnormality.
