the
to
the
apparent
fact
that
the
person
there
had
what
was
volitionally
impaired.
you're
saying
that
was
descriptive
rather
than
essential
to
the
holding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
your
statute
itself,
when
you're
talking
about
a
sexually
violent
predator,
you
say
mental
abnormality
or
personality
disorder,
which
makes
the
person
likely
to
engage
in
repeat
acts
of
sexual
violence.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
d-
just-
just
a
minute,
mr.
don-
the
question
presented
by
the
state
is
is
in-
in
its
petition
for
certiorari
is-
is
a
very
general
one,
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
the
state
to
prove
that
a
sa-
and
i
think
if
you're
going
to
bring
up
a
jury
instruction,
you're
required
to
cross
petition
for
certiorari
and
raise
that
yourself.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
answer
justice
stevens'
question.

william
h.

thank
you,
