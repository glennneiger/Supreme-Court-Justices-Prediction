i
mean,
can
psychiatrists
--
unknown

certainly
forty
to
sixty...
unknown

i
doubt
that

so,
it's
part

unknown

our
--
unknown

capacity
--
unknown
speaker
[inaudible]
unknown

one
part
--
unknown

so
--
unknown

court
would
say
that
--
unknown

there
--
unknown
speaker
three
of
seven.
unknown
speaker
we
have
to
be

that's
exactly

that
you've
always
required.

that
it
would
be.

you're
concerned
that
the

so,
what
are
the

that
you
