the
premise
that
hendricks
proceeded
upon.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
are
are
you
trying
to
say
that
what
we
said
in
hendricks
was
was
dictum
or...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
wrong
in
the
in
the
context
of
that
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
some
misimpression
as
as
to
hendricks'
ability
to
control
himself?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
seems
to
me,
that
we're
back
to
square
one.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
test
are
there
different
requirements
if
you
proceed
based
on
a
personality
disorder
than
if
you
proceed
from
a
mental
abnormality?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
suggesting
that
you
thought
there
was
based
on
the
answer
you
gave
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they're
both
one
and
the
same.
justice
anthony

on
what
you
think
the
law
ought
to
be
and
what
the
s-
s-
un-
and
how
the
statute
is
properly
interpreted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
anybody
with
a
personality
disorder
that's
a
danger
to
himself
or
others
can
be
can
be
civilly
committed
regardless
of
volitional
control.

anthony
m.

a
frequent
case,
though,
that
the
psychiatrists
say,
well,
we
can't
tell
until
we
clinically
re-observe
him
and
we
can't
clinically
observe
him
until
he's
in
a
normal
environment?

anthony
m.
kennedy
you
to
do
things
you
want
to
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
that,
it
seems
to
me,
doesn't
answer
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where
is
it
in
the
statutory
language
that
talks
about
v-
volitional
control?
it
it
doesn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have
a
nice
speaking
voice,
but
could
you
raise
it
just
a
little
bit?
i...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
there
has
to
be
some
additional
elements.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
most
appropriate
one
at
hand
in
this
case
was
volitional.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would-
would
your
objections
and
the
kansa-
and
perhaps
the
kansas
court's
objections
have
been
met
if
instruction
number
nine

fifty-six
of
the

said
