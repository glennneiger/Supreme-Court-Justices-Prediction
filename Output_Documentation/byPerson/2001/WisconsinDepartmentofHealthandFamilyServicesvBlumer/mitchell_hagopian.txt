mr.
mitchell
hagopian
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
yes.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
the...
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
now
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
correct.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
well
i
i
s-
i
would
agree
with
you,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
typical
case
is
statistically
that
it
is
the
husband
that
goes
into
the
nursing
home
first,
and
we
don't
have
that
case
here
today,
but
i
i
believe
i
disagree
with
you
a-
as
to
the
effect
that
this
has.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
i
don't
think
i
answered
your
question,
justice
kennedy
i-
but
the
i-
the
institutionalized
spouse,
if
it
is
the
high-
er
are
am
i
are
you
asking
me
whether,
if
the
institutionalized
spouse
has
a
higher
income,
that
that
what
happened
here
won't
happen?
is
that
the
question,
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
that's
correct,
so
in
fact
in
many
cases
the
income
first
rule
will
have
a
worse
effect
when
the
husband
is
the
one
that
goes
in
first.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
yes.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
we
don't
exactly
know.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
oh,
absolutely
not
justice
scalia.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
well,
that's
essentially
what
they've
decided
to
do...
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
rule
is
to
leave
it
floating.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
lawful,
that's...
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
that's
right.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
in
a
case
like
batterton
b
v
francis,
w-
we
have
a
different
set
of
rules
here.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
mhm.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
well,
there's
a
a
couple
of
first
of
all,
the
the
authority
that
the
secretary
has
relied
on
to
issue
its
proposed
rule
and
apparently
from
which
its
authority
to
develop
the
rule
at
all
is
thirteen
ninety-six
a
a
seventeen
sub
b.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
it's
almost
as
difficult
to
say
it.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
well,
i-
i-
i've
two
responses
to
that,
justice
stevens.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
the
institutionalized
spouse's
wages,
or
the...
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
absolutely.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
yes,
i
believe
that
it
does...
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
right.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
well,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
resource-first
allowance,
refor-
resource-first
rule
was
placed
in
a
provision
that
is
what
we
call
the
fail
safe
provision.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
absolutely.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
that's
right,
and
and
to
stress
the
exceptional
case
component
of
it,
you
have
to
remember
how
you
get
one
of
these
hearings.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
yes,
i
have,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
yes,
that's
certainly
one
of
our
arguments
against
it.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
well,
because
our
position
is
that
the
position
they're
taking
is
totally
unreasonable,
no,
you
don't
owe
any
deference
to
the
agency.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
not
necessarily.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
right.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
tha-
that
was
a
question?
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
i
i
concur
with
everything
you
just
said,
justice
breyer.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
it
would
be.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
no,
no,
we
do
make
that...
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
well,
it
was
in
the
opening
that
i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
make,
so
in
your
response
to
justice
breyer,
isn't
it
so,
or
am
i
counsel,
am...
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
[inaudible]
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
well,
i'm
no
expert
on
erisa,
but
i
believe
that
there
is
a
notice
requirement
and
a
sign-off
requirement
in
erisa.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
that's
right,
but
i
think
those
decisions
are
made
at
a
time
when
long-term
care
is
not
necessarily
in
the
immediate
offing,
and
maybe
usually
at
age
sixty-five
or
thereabouts,
long
before
nursing
home
stays
may
be
inevitable,
and
so
the
couple
is
making
an
informed
choice
about
how
best
to
maximize
their
income
stream.
mr.
mitchell
hagopian
i
think
i
frankly
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia.
