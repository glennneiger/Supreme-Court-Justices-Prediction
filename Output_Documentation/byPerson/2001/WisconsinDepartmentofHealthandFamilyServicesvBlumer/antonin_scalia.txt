justice
antonin
scalia
eight
a?
justice
antonin
scalia
point
is
undoubtedly
correct
that
income
of
the
community
spouse
there
means
income
of
the
community
spouse
alone,
not
any
attri-
attributed
income
from
the
institutionalized
spouse,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
right?
it
it
has
to
mean
only
the
income
of
the
community
spouse.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
do
you
have
any
other
section
in
the
act
in
which
the
phrase,
income
of
the
community
spouse,
means
not
just
the
income
of
the
s-
p-
community
spouse
alone,
but
also
income
that
has
been
attributed
from
the
institutionalized
spouse?
justice
antonin
scalia
d
to
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
eighteen
a
of
the...
justice
antonin
scalia
could
could
i
have
an
answer
to
my
question?
the
the
section
you
just
referred
me
to
is
still
not
another
section
other
than
the
one
at
issue
here
in
which
the
simple
phrase,
income
of
the
community
spouse,
is
used
in
a
sense
that
means
the
the
community
spouse's
own
income
plus
any
income
attributed
to
the
community
spouse
from
the
institutionalized
spouse.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
think
that
rather
solves
the
difficulty,
frankly.
justice
antonin
scalia
think
that
ins-
that
income
of
the
of
the
community
spouse
means
income
of
the
community
spouse,
and
you
say
it
means
no,
the
community
spouse's
own
income
plus
attributed
income.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that,
that's
all
i'm
asking
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
you
can't
give
me
an
answer
right
away,
maybe
you
can
when
you
come
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
what
authority
the
secretary
has
to
say
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
so
it
can
mean
either
one?
we
don't
even
let
federal
agencies
do
that
under
chevron.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
about
e-
every
ambiguity,
i
mean,
that
there
are
two
different
methodologies.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah
im-
yeah
point
source
of
emission.
justice
antonin
scalia
leave
that
background
principle
in
place,
and
we
can
all
concede
that
it's
in
place,
without
thereby
coming
to
the
belief
that
when
you
say
income
of
the
community
spouse,
you
mean,
income
of
the
community
spouse
plus
whatever
is
deemed
attributable
to
the
community
spouse.
justice
antonin
scalia
sorry
what
did
it
mean,
income
from
other
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
given
you
by
your
children
on
a
regular
basis,
and
things
of
that
sort?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
you
you...
justice
antonin
scalia
mean
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
a
really
hard-nosed
state
could
do
both,
right,
could
use
the
income-first
rule
plus
plus
adjust
downward
the
the
other
i
mean,
th-
the
the
two
don't
go
with
each
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
downward
or
use
the
income
first.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your
burden
if
it
is
ambiguous?
if
it
is
ambiguous,
do
do
you
lose,
do
you
acknowledge
that
you
lose?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
the
ambiguity
has
--
do
you
think
the
ambiguity
has
to
be
resolved,
or
can
can
the
secretary
just
just
leave
the
ambiguity
floating
out
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
proper,
you
mean
lawful?
y-
justice
antonin
scalia
are
not
permitted
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
in
that
particular
provision,
to
retain
an
adequate
amount
of
resources,
all
that
all
that
any
other
income
attributable
to
the
community
spouse
need
mean
is
income
attributable
to
him
from
sources
other
than
interest
on
on
on
his
on
his
resources.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
community
spouse's...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
it...
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
resources
that
provide
income,
which
means,
you
know,
stocks
or
whatever,
and
all
that
phrase
there
need
mean
is
something,
any
any
other
income
attributable
to
him
from
something
other
than
his
stocks.
justice
antonin
scalia
such
as
his
wages,
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hagopian,
i
want
to
come
back
to
the
snippet
from
legislative
history
that's
referred
to
on
page
eighteen
of
the
government's
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
know
what
i
mean?
