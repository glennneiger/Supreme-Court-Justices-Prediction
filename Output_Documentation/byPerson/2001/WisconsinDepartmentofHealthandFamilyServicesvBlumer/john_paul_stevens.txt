it'd
be
very
helpful
to
me
if,
right
at
this
point,
you
pointed
the
statutory
pointed
out
the
statutory
provision
that
authorizes
the
state
to
transfer
income
at
this
stage.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
eight
a.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
on
fifty-nine
a
of
your
cert
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
fifty-nine
a.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
the
situation
you're
talking
about
we're
deeming
in
the
other
direction,
where
they
deem
the
community
spouse
income
to
be
attributable
to
the
institutionalized
spouse,
not
vice
versa?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
was
for
purposes
of
determining
how
much
of
the
community
spouse's
income
should
be
deemed
to
belong
to
the
institutionalized
spouse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
resource-first
rule
gives
greater
protection
to
the
community
spouse
than
the
income-first
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
there
is
express
statutory
authorization
for
the
refour-
resource-first
method,
whereas
the
income-first
method
is
drawn
by
inference
from
what
you
consider
ambiguities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
go
over
that
a
little
more
slowly...
justice
john
paul
stevens
deeming
as
well
as
deeming?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
if
there's
no
prohibition,
where
is
your
authorization
for
doing
this?
that's
what
i
don't
find
in
the...
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
start
from
a
background
rule
of
the
name
on
the
check
as
a
background
rule
for
the
whole
ssi
program,
how
can
you
change
that
rule
without
authorization?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pardon
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
statute
does
it
say
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
deeming,
not
reverse
deeming.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
know
a
case
is
easier
if
you
don't
look
at
the
legislative
history,
and
so
it's
probably
easier
for
my
colleague
than
it
is
for
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
comment
on
on
c
one
of
the
questions
i
asked
mr.
lamken,
whether
the
background
rule
is
the
name-on-the-check
rule,
or
as
he
puts
it,
the
ri-
the
better
view
is
the
background
rule
is
one
of
deeming,
and
so
that
we
should
start
from
the
premise
that
it's
okay
to
treat
one
spouse's
income
as
part
of
the
other
spouse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
even
under
this
program,
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
post
eligibility
determination
the
income
can
be
transferred
from
the
institutionalized
spouse
to
the
community
spouse.
