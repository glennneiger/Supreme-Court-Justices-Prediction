ms.
flanagan,
as
i
understand
it,
the
there's
a
provision
and
these
have
been
referred
to
this
morning,
but
there's
a
provision
that
forbids
attribution
from
the
community
spouse
to
the
institutionalized
spouse
period,
no
qualifications
on
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
also
a
provision
which
recognizes
the
possibility
of
transferring
income
from
the
institutionalized
spouse
to
the
community
spouse
after
eligibility
has
been
determined,
but
does
not
require
any
such
transfer.
justice
david
h.
souter
r-
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
doesn't,
that
latter
provision
doesn't
make
any
reference
to
the
period
before
eligibility,
and
i
guess
my
question
is,
why
don't
we
why
don't
we
infer
some
kind
of
a
negative
inference
when
when
the
provision
refers
totally
to
the
post
eligibility
period,
why
don't
we
find
some
negative
implication
that
it
was
not
expected
in
the
pre-eligibility
period?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
so
basically
the
answer
is,
the
fair
hearing
has
got
to
take
place
before
eligibility
is
determined
,
and
that's
in
effect
the
answer
to
my...
justice
david
h.
souter
it
the
only
thing
that
you've
got
expressed
in
the
record
anywhere
to
indicate
that
that
really
is
what
congress
had
in
mind
is
the
statement
in
the
legislative
history
that
is
quoted
in
the
briefs
that
refers
to
other
income
attributed,
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
only
thing
in
black
and
white.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
your
argument
in
in
the
event
that
we
find
ambiguity
is
i
guess
boils
down
simply
to
the
fact
that
for
a
variety
of
reasons
it
would
frustrate
the
congressional
policy
behind
the
act
itself
if
we
held
against
you,
and
yet
in
a
in
a
way,
haven't
you
provided
a
an
answer
to
that,
a
counter
to
that
argument
in
in
your
answer
to
a
question
a
few
moments
ago?
you
you
said,
and
i
i
think
have
to
say,
that
if
if
the
states
lose
on
the
particular
issue
before
us
here,
the
states
as
a
practical
matter
can
get
to
the
same
kind
of
rough
dollar
and
cents
result
simply
by
adjusting
the
the
the
the
the
amount
of
resources,
that
is
the
the
the
the
th-
the
baseline
amount
for
the
community
spouse
to
retain
and
the
amount
of
income
which
is
thought
to
be
necessary
for
the
community
spouse
to
to
live
decently,
so
it
it
it
almost
seems
as
though
it
doesn't
very
much
matter,
necessarily,
to
the
enactment
of
whatever
policy
congress
had,
whether
the
flexibility
comes
in
income
first
versus
resource
first,
or
whether
it
comes
in
setting
the
the
the
allowances
for
income
and
assets.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
is
kind
of
an
exceptional
case
kind
of
mechanism,
regardless
of
how
you
set
income
and
resources.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
as
an
as
a
as
an
exceptional
case
mechanism,
it's
only
going
to
work
if
it
works
the
way
you
say,
on
a
resource-first
basis?
