ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
nineteen
eighty-eight,
congress
enacted
the
spousal
impoverishment
protections
of
the
federal
medicaid
act,
forty
two
us
code
section
thirteen
ninety-six
r
five,
to
accomplish
two
competing
purposes.
first,
congress
sought
to
protect
spouses
living
at
home
from
impoverishment
when
the
other
spouse
is
institutionalized
and
requires
long-term
nursing
home
care.
secondly,
congress
sought
to
ensure
that
married
couples
seeking
medicaid
bear
a
fair
share
of
the
cost
of
such
care.
this
case
concerns
whether
states
have
the
discretion
to
achieve
those
competing
goals
by
taking
into
account
at
the
time
medicaid
eligibility
is
determined
available
income
which
the
nursing
home
spouse
is
permitted
to
use
after
eligibility
to
support
the
at-home
spouse.
when
the
nursing
home
spouse
applies
for
medicaid,
section
thirteen
ninety-six
r
five
permits
the
community
spouse
to
retain
certain
income
and
resources
to
mit-
to
meet
his
own
monthly
maintenance
needs.
the
statute
permits
an
increase
in
the
standard
resource
allowance,
however,
if
the
at-home
spouse
can
show
at
a
fair
hearing
that
the
allowance
will
be
inadequate
to
provide
him
with
income
at
the
state-protected
level
once
the
nursing
home
spouse
qualifies
for
medicaid.
when
making
this
determination,
wisconsin,
like
more
than
thirty
other
states,
first
considers
whether
income
available
to
the
at-home
spouse
from
the
nursing
home
spouse
will
be
sufficient
to
ensure
the
protected
level
of
income
once
medicaid
eligibility
occurs.
this
method
of
determining
whether
to
increase
or
to
substitute
the
standard
resource
allowance
is
called
the
income-first
rule.
[inaudible]
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
the
the
remaining
states
use
a
methodology
called
resource
first,
in
which
they
look
first
to
the
additional
resources
above
the
standard
resource
allowance.
the-
these
cases
only
arise
where
the
couple
has
resources
above
the
standard
allowance.
in...
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
this
case...
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
the
the
statutory
provision,
i
think,
specifically
is
found
in
forty-two
us
code
thirteen
ninety-six
a,
sub
a
seven-
sub
seventeen,
which
deals
with
state
standards
for
eligibility
and
and
the
secretary's
authority
to
set
standards
for...
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
it's
in
the
attor-
the
solicitor
general's
appendix
at
the
first
thing
in
their
appendix
is
the
codified
statute,
thirty-
s-
thirteen
ninety-six
r
five,
the
one
we
are
discussing
primarily,
and
no,
i'm
sorry,
thirteen
ninety-six
a
is
in
the
first
thing
in
the
solicitor
general's
appendix.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
yes,
and
a
seventeen.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
honor,
it
is.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
okay,
i-
a
a
seventeen
provides
that
the
secretary
shall
include
reasonable
standards,
and
then
you
skip
the
one
pareth-
parenthetical,
for
determining
eligibility
for
and
the
extent
of
medical
assistance
under
the
state
plan,
and
then
under
b,
provide
for
taking
into
account
only
such
income
and
resources
as
are
as
determined
in
accordance
with
standards
prescribed
by
the
secretary
available
to
the
applicant
or
recipient,
et
cetera.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
and...
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
that's
right.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
we're
talking
about
a
determination
that's
made
at
the
point
of
eligibility,
but
which
concerns
income
available
post
eligibility.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
well...
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
the...
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
i
think
you
have
to
take
into
account
that
you're
talking
about
income
being
calculated
at
different
points
in
the
temporal
spectrum
for
different
purposes.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
refers
only
to
prohibiting
income
of
the
community
spouse
from
being
deemed
available...
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
what's
available
at
that
point.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
under
the
definition
of
community
spouse,
income
maintenance
allowance,
i
believe
that
which
is
under
subsection
d
to
b...
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
d
to
b,
refers...
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
at
any
rate,
that
that
particular
section
refers
to
monthly
income
otherwise
available
to
the
community
spouse,
and
the...
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
is
that
this
evidences
an
recognition
of
the
of
the
fact,
as
medicaid
has
long
recognized,
that
spouses
are
required
to
s-
support
one
another,
and
that
this
is
a
a
background
rule.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
that's
right,
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
subsection
b
one,
thirteen
ninety-six
r
five
b
one,
and
that
was
referred
to...
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
right.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
yes.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
i
don't
believe
it's
used
anywhere
else.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
respect,
your
honor,
the
medicaid
statute
has
long
considered
available
income
as
part
of
the
income
of
the
person
to
which
it's
referring,
and...
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
th-
that
particular
phrase
is
not
used
frequently
in
this
statute.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
well,
your
honor,
justice
stevens,
the
the
background
rule
which
i
referred
to
which
this
court
clearly
articulated
in
gray
panthers
case
is
that
spouses
are
expected
to
support
one
another.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
that's
right.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
and
the
court
clearly
recognized
that.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
the
the
result
is
that
it
permits
the
in
general
it
frequently
permits
the
at-home
spouse
to
retain
a
greater
share
of
the
couple's
joint
resources
than
would
be
the
case
under
the
state-defined
standard
resource
allowance,
and
in
that
sense,
yes,
that's
definitely
correct.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
no,
it
doesn't.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
it
was
initially
adopted
as
a
matter
of
policy
by
the
state
agency
immediately
after
passage
of
the
statute.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
that
well,
that
is
what
they
did,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
require
the
transfer.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
to...
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
basically
require
them
to
do
it.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
well,
the
fact
is
that
the
calculation
that
ta-
the
the
hearing
officers
ask
to
be
made
here
concerns
the
post
eligibility
period.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
but
the
calculation
is
looking
ahead,
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
well,
that
really
doesn't
arise
because
of
subsection
b
one,
which
expressly
precludes
that.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
well,
neither
of
us
have
any
statistics
on
that.
ms.
maureen
m.
flanagan
would
have
had
money.
