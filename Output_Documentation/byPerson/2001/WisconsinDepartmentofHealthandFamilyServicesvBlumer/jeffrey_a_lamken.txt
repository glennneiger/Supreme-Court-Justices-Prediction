your

mr.

yes,

mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
november
sixth.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
answer
comes
in
two
parts.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
in
fact,
justice
scalia,
this
court
has
upheld
precisely
that
type
of
regulation
issued
by
the
secretary.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
that
is
that
there
is
no
prohibition
on
deeming
income
of
the
institutionalized
spouse...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
it
was
a
it's
a...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
the
mistake,
justice...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
the
mistake,
justice
stevens.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
statute
doesn't
but
st-
congress
said
it
when
it
enacted
the
medicaid
act
in
the
first
instance,
and
that
was
the
established
rule
under
the
secretary's
policies
at
the
time
that
this
statute
was
enacted.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
deeming
did
occur
reverse
deeming
did
occur,
or
could
occur
under
the
prior
policies,
particularly
in
section
two
oh
nine
b
states.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
it
would
be
the
the
secretary's
or
the
regulations
that
existed
at
this
time,
when
they
discussed
what
we
count
as
your
income,
as
your
applicant
for
ssi,
for
example,
it
said,
we
count
as
your
income
your
income
plus
income
from
other
people,
so
that
it
treated
it
as
the
individual's
income,
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
background
principle
that
sp-
each
spouse's
income
is
income
to
the
other
spouse,
and
when
states
may
establish
reasonable
standards...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
their...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
actually
attributed
inc-
income,
justice
scalia,
actual
income
that's
passed
over
you
don't
need
a
deeming
rule,
because...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
for
responsible
individuals
there
were
categories,
such
as
spouses,
such
as
parents,
such
as
there
is
another
category
i
can't
remember
the
name
of,
but
where
somebody
had
e-
e-
responsibility
for
supporting
you,
their
income
was
deemed
to
be
your
income
for
determining
your
eligibility.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
is
the
only
thing
in
black
and
white,
other
than
the
fact
that
the
settled
background
principles
the
secretary
operated
under
before
the
enactment
would
treat
the
income
of
one
spouse
as
available
to
the
other.
