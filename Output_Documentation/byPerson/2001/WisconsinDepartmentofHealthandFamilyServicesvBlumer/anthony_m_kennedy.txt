income-first
rule
in
wisconsin
adopted
by
the
legislature,
or
by
a
state
agency?
or...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
your
state
court,
i
take
it,
under
prevailing
wisconsin
rules,
could
not
ignore
the
legislature's
determination
unless
it
found
that
the
federal
statute
was
unambiguous.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
but
doesn't
that
assume
your
case
and
not
the
more
typical
case,
the
more
typical
case,
e-
given
statistical
projections,
is
that
the
husband
will
be
the
institutionalized
per-
and
so
in
the
typical
case
it
will
not
work
to
the
advantage
of
the
couple?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yi-
yes.
