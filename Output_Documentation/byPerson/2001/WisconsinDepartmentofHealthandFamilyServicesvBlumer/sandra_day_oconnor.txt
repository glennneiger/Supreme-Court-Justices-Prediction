o'connor
well,
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
a
question
on
this
point,
if
i
may.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you're
talking
now
about
post
eligibility?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
says
pre-eligibility
none
of
the
income
of
the
community
spouse
shall
be
deemed
available...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
provision
wouldn't
make
sense
if
income
of
the
community
spouse
itself
included
income
of
the
institutionalized
spouse.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
it?
that
wouldn't
make
any
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you're
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
the
phrase,
community
spouse's
income
in
c
in
e
two
c
includes
income
from
the
institutionalized
spouse,
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
can't
under
that
section
i
read,
i
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
the
section
i
read
to
you...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
my
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lamken,
you've
heard
the
questions,
and
it
is
difficult,
looking
at
the
text
of
the
statute,
to
figure
out
what
supports
the
petitioner's
view,
although,
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
also
the
view
of
the
federal
government
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there
proposed
regulations
of
hhs
that
would
allow
either
resource-first
or
income-first
rules?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
far
along
is
that
process?
when
is
that
going
to
be
adopted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
would
you
mind
telling
us
why
it
matters
which
rule
is
followed
by
a
state,
resource
for
first
or
income
first,
not
just
in
an
individual
case,
but
overall?
who
who
saves
what
in
terms
of
money
if
you
do
one
thing
or
the
other?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
states
cannot
follow
this
income-first
rule,
maybe
they
would
just
respond
by
reducing
the
minimum
monthly
maintenance
needs
allowance
and
adjust
it
that
way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
adjust
downward
the
resources
protectable
for
the
community
spouse.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
many
states
are
using
income
first?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
owe
any
deference
to
the
agency
here
in
its
interpretation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
income-first
rule
mean
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
less
federal
money
is
spent
on
medicaid
care?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
that
your
response
would
be
the
statutory
language
requires
the
result
you're
urging,
but
you
don't
make
that
argument,
apparently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
hear
that
in
response
to
the
question.
