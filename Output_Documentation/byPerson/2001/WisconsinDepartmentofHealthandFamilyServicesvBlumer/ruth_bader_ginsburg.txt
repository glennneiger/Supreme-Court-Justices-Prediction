ms.
flanagan,
it
might
help
if
i
think
one
of
the
main
features
of
this
legislation
was
that
income
from
the
community
spouse
was
never
to
be
attributed
to
the
institutionalized
spouse,
but
vice
versa,
there
there
is
no
such
prohibition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
makes
sense
unless
you
appreciate
that
there
that
was
an
absolute
prohibition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
the
payments,
the
the
actual
payments
start
earlier?
i
mean,
the
the
reason
this
this
was
of
such
concern
is
that
the
institutionalized
spouse
would
not
be
eligible
monthly
for
checks,
so
that
the
immediate
effect
was
to
she
could
pay
down
more
rapidly
what
was
her
excess
resources
before
she
qualified.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
the
yes,
so
that
bu-
justice
o'connor
asked
you
what
the
effect
of
when
i...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
most
immediate
effect
of,
is
she
starts
to
collect
medicaid
sooner
and
doesn't
use...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
spousal
resources.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
i'm
not
making
myself
clear.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yeah.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
you
read
the
notice
of
the
proposed
rulemaking?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
suppose
your
argument
is
to
the
effect
that
that
is
just
not
a
permissible
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wrong
in
thinking
that
under
erisa
there
is
a
requirement
to
provide
for
the
surviving
spouse,
it
isn't
the
option
of
the
insured
individual?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
the
insured's
election
in
the
first
place.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
isn't
the
wage
earner's
choice...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
want,
usually
her,
to
be
any
part
of
it.
