yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
might
ask
one
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
putting
the
thing...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see
that
at
the
moment
i'm
thinking,
well,
i
can't
figure
it
out
but
i'm
working
with
those
examples
and
and
since
i
can't,
i
say,
leave
it
up
to
the
secretary,
leave
it
up
to
the
state,
leave
it
up
to
somebody
else
as
long
as
the
statutue
allows
that
i
i
wanted
to
expose
that
to
you
because
i
want
you
to
have
a
chance
to
say,
no,
you're
wrong,
your
example
is
wrong,
your
reasoning
is
wrong,
everything's
wrong,
so,
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
although
that
you
make
a
big
point
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that?
i
mean,
he
just...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
said
on
that
that
that
and
i
certainly
was
in
the
briefs,
that
that
if
you
say
they
have
to
spend
down
the
three
hundred
thousand,
they're
not
going
to
give
it
to
the
doctors
in
the
institution.
