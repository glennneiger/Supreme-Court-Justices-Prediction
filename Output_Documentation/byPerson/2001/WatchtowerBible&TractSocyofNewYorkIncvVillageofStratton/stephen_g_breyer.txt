case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you
is
is
it
the
the
case
that
your
clients
don't
ask
for
any
money,
not
a
penny,
and
they
don't
sell
bibles,
and
they're
not
selling
anything,
they're
all
all
that
they
do
is
say,
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
religion?
they
don't
ask
for
anything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
said
just
you
briefly
mentioned
because
i,
you
know,
i've
had
many
fine
conversations
with
jehovah's
witnesses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
that
is
that
here
in
front
of
us?
i
mean,
what
i'm
having
a
hard
time
getting
my
hands
on
is,
it
looks
as
if
a
group
of
people
who
really
don't
mind
giving
their
name
are
objecting
in
the
name
of
a
different
group
of
people
who
might
not,
and
those
might
be
people
who
might
want
to
say,
vote
for
smith,
and
what's
worrying
me
about
deciding
this
case
in
the
context
which
is
obvious
from
the
briefs
is,
that
might
have
considerable
legal
implications
for
the
question
of
whether
you
can
require
disclosure
of
campaign
contributions,
which
is
a
totally
different
issue,
but
would
seem
legally
related,
so
i'd
i'd
appreciate
those
three
things
that
i've
mentioned
or
y-
you
see
what
i'm
what
i-
what
the
blur
is
in
my
mind,
and
i'd
appreciate
your
views
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
even
if
that's
so,
i
mean,
where
i
slight
state
of
confusion
is,
i
thought
this
case
now
sounds
very
theoretical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
want
you
there
because
they
know
at
least
you'll
find
out
which
homeowners
don't
want
people
around,
and
you'll
l-
read
what
the
rules
are,
all
right.

you
