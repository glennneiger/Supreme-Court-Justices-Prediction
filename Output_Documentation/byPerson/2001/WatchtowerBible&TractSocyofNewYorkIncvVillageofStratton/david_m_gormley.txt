mr.
david
m.
gormley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
david
m.
gormley
but
your
honor,
mr.
david
m.
gormley
but
the
point
is,
your
honor,
the
ordinance
is
designed
to
protect
the
concerns
that
village
residents
have,
no
matter
how
much
space
is
between
them
and...
mr.
david
m.
gormley
your
honor,
the
the
point
would
be
that
when
someone
knocks
on
a
door,
no
matter
how
far
away
they
are
from
a
sidewalk
or
a
street,
there
is
concern
o-
on
the
part
of
the
resident
that
this
often
a
stranger,
certainly
an
uninvited
person,
is
here
on
my
property,
perhaps
just
a
few
inches
away
from
from
a
public
way,
but
nonetheless
coming
to
my
home,
perhaps
asking
to
actually
enter
my
home,
and
i
think
the
village
is
entitled
to
say,
we're
concerned
about
that
kind
of...
mr.
david
m.
gormley
but
your
honor,
that's
no
different
than
the
frisby
case
decided
by
this
court
fourteen
years
ago.
mr.
david
m.
gormley
nonetheless,
i
think
in
both
situations,
your
honor,
the
government
is
rightly
concerned
about
an
activity
that
causes
some
public
problem.
mr.
david
m.
gormley
sure,
well,
i
certainly
no
trespassing
signs
address
some
of
the...
mr.
david
m.
gormley
often
provide
after
the
fact
remedies,
if
someone
actually
invades
the
space
you
can
prosecute,
but
by
then
you
may
well
not
be
able
to
find
the
person
any
more,
and
even
with
the
the
no
solicitation
registration
form
that
the
petitioners
have
not
challenged,
that
does
not
protect
the
person
who,
for
whatever
reason,
chooses
not
to
put
up
such
a
sign.
mr.
david
m.
gormley
well,
i
think
that
both
of
the
courts
below
applied
applied
the
proper
approach.
mr.
david
m.
gormley
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals...
mr.
david
m.
gormley
yes,
your
honor,
e-
and
i
think
that's
true
here,
because
every
time
that
someone
approaches
the
private
property,
comes
onto
the
private
property
of
a
village
resident,
those
residents
are
rightly
concerned
about
who
this
uninvited...
mr.
david
m.
gormley
but
i
think
the
village
rightly
is
concerned
with
having
some
information...
mr.
david
m.
gormley
because
it
it
gives
some
record
o-
on
file
about
who
these
people
are,
thereby
giving
village
residents
a
little
greater
sense
of
security
that
if
something
goes
wrong
when
this
person
is
on
my
land,
i'm
not...
mr.
david
m.
gormley
absolutely.
mr.
david
m.
gormley
oh
i
i-
mean
just
coming...
mr.
david
m.
gormley
maybe
maybe
he
wants
to
steal
your
property.
mr.
david
m.
gormley
but,
your
honor,
i
think
the
fact
that
the
ordinance
is
not
going
to
catch
everyone
who's
going
to
do
something
wrong
doesn't
mean
that
the
village
is
not
entitled
to
try
to
do
something
to
give
its
residents
some
comfort.
mr.
david
m.
gormley
i
i
think
it
does
your
honor,
and
it's
it's
a
very
modest
restriction.
mr.
david
m.
gormley
well,
i
but
i
think,
your
honor,
it's
a
it
shows
that
this
village
is
perhaps
trying
to
to
take
some
proactive
steps
that
other
communities
have
not...
mr.
david
m.
gormley
i-
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
david
m.
gormley
i
think
he
was
s-
speaking
about
the
jehovah's
witnesses,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
gormley
i-
certainly
that's
the
part
of
the
ordinance
that
the
petitioners
have
not
challenged
here.
mr.
david
m.
gormley
i
mean,
given
your
the
the
court's
decision
in
martin,
i
wouldd
be
hesitant
to
say
you
can
have
an
outright
ban
on
ringing
doorbells
or
knocking.
mr.
david
m.
gormley
thank
you
your
honor.
