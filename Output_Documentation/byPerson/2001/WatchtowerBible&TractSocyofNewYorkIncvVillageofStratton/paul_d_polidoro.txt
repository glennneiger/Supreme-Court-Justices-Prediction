mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
it's
eleven
o'clock
saturday
morning
in
the
village
of
stratton.
good
morning.
in
light
of
recent
events,
i've
made
a
special
effort
to
come
to
your
door
to
speak
to
you
about
what
the
prophet
isaiah
has
referred
to
as
the
good
news
of
something
better.
that's
the
good
news
christ
jesus
spoke
about,
the
good
news
of
the
kingdom
of
god.
it
is
a
criminal
act
to
go
from
door
to
door
in
the
village
of
stratton
and
deliver
that
message
unless
one
has
first
obtained
a
permit
from
the
village
to
do
so.
it
is
also
illegal
to
go
from
door
to
door
and
hand
out
a
leaflet
that
says,
democracy
is
wonderful,
please
vote
next
week.
in
drafting
a
permit
scheme
designed
to
address
fraud
and
privacy
that
includes
those
interested
in
pure
discourse,
stratton
has
eliminated
the
ability
to
engage
in
door
to
door,
one
on
one
political
advocacy.
as
such,
we
submit
the
ordinance
is
overbroad
and
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
your
honor,
we
are
not
s-
suggesting
at
all
that
a
resident
cannot
post
a
no
trespassing
sign
and
keep
all
away
from
their
door.
however,
in
order
to
get
the
right
to
go
to
that
door,
one
must
go
to
the
mayor,
give
his
name,
give
a
brief
description
of
the
cause
they
want
to
speak
about,
as
well
as
their
association
or
affiliation.
we
believe
that
this
court
in
mcintyre
said
there's
an
interest
in
having
anonymous
works
enter
the
marketplace
of
ideas,
and
that
unquestionably
outweighs
any
interest
in
requiring
disclosure
as
a
precondition
to
entry.
[inaudible]
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
they
are,
absolutely,
indeed,
your
honor.
under
ohio
state
law
those
records
are
open
to
the
public,
so
anyone
would
be
able
to
go
to
look
at
the
record,
which
would
include
the
name,
your
message,
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
and
your
associations.
so
you
you
you
you
you
would
have...
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
your
honor,
we
believe
the
name
is
the
constitutional
infirmity
in
deed.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
well,
actually,
your
honor,
in
this
circumstance
the
village
of
wellsville,
which
is
a
neighboring
village,
has
assumed
responsibility
for
preaching
door
to
door
in
the
village
of
stratton,
and
many
individuals
are,
in
fact,
known
to
each
other,
and
that's
common
in
most
areas
of
this
country.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
your
honor,
your
honor
jehovah's
witnesses
have
a
long
historical
memory
as
to
what
they've
suffered
at
the
hands
of...
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
purely
to
go
door
to
door
to
speak
the
good
news.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
your
honor,
we
believe
that
under
this
court's
holding
there
are
some
individuals
who
do
not
want
to
identify
their
cause.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
justice
ginsburg,
if
i
might,
at
the
joint
appendix
on
page
two
forty-eight
a
is
a
copy
of
the
blank
permit
and
it
says,
permit
to
canvass,
to
solicit,
et
cetera,
and
it
says,
in
accordance
with
the
relevant
provision
of
the
statute,
the
mayor
of
the
village
of
stratton,
ohio,
has
issued
to
the
above
applicant
a
permit
the
above
applicant
a
permit,
so
we
believe
on
the
plain
language
of
the
permit,
the
name
is,
indeed,
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
that's
correct,
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
there's
no
showing,
justice
souter,
in
the
ordinance
that
there
is
any
sort
of
numbering
scheme.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
but
justice
souter,
i
believe
the
exhibit
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
concession
of
the
village
that
name
disclosure
is,
in
fact,
required
at
the
door.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
it's
different
for
two
reasons,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
i
think
there's
a
distinction,
justice
souter,
to
just
pure
speech,
the
dissemination
of
information
and
ideas,
and
speech
that
in
some
way
involves
the
mechanics
of
the
electoral
process.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
but
that
disclosure
took
place
after
the
one
on
one
dissemination
of
information
was
done.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
because
of
the
compelling
governmental
governmental
interest
that's
involved,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that's
the
distinction.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
it
is,
indeed,
the...
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
your
honor,
the
record
is
absolutely
clear,
in
the
village
of
stratton,
jehovah's
witnesses
did
not
ask
for
money.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
we
do,
your
honor,
on
a
no-cost
basis
if
someone's
interested
in
reading
it.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
no,
your
honor,
jehovah's
witnesses
have
no
objection
to
giving
their
name.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
justice
breyer,
it
has
been
our
contention
that
the
ordinance
was
drafted
in
an
overbroad
manner,
meaning
reaching
speech
that
was
not
the
source
of
harm,
including
our
religious
speech,
but
also
including
pure
political
speech.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
your
honor,
we
then
don't
see...
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
we
don't
believe
that
this
court
should
sanction
a
regulation
of
a
government
that
requires
one
citizen
to
get
a
license
to
speak
to
another
citizen
at
that
citizen's
home.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
your
honor,
i
i
think
that
buckley
followed
on
language
in
your
honor's
portion
of
the
opinion
in
mcintyre,
where
you
spoke
to
limited
circumst-
there
might
be
larger
circumstances
where
identification
might
be
required,
and
in
the
electoral
process,
the
mechanics
of
how
an
election
works,
those
are
larger
purposes.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
justice
ginsburg,
the
only
precedent
that
i'm
aware
of
with
respect
to
identification
schemes
comes
from
the
dicta
in
cantwell
and
martin
that
speaks
about
a
municipality,
a
z-
municipality's
interest
in
knowing
strangers
in
the
community
when
connected
with
the
solicitation
of
funds.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
justice
o'connor,
my
experience
is
quite
to
the
opposite,
that
after
the
battles
between
jehovah's
witnesses
and
the
municipalities
in
the
thirties
and
forties,
municipalities
have
stopped
attempting
to
regulate
jehovah's
witnesses
by
forcing
them
to
get
a
permit
to
go
from
door
to
door.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
chief
justice
rehnquist,
we
think
it's
implausible
to
think
that
someone
intent
on
committing
a
violent
crime
would
stop
at
the
city
hall
to
get
a
permit
or
in
any
way
be
deterred,
and
in
the
circumstance
your
honor
posits
of
someone
just
going
door
to
door
and
observing,
or
taking
notes,
the
ordinance
in
this
instance
doesn't
prevent
that.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
no,
chief
jus-
no,
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
it's
anyone
who
wants
to
go
to
door
to
door
to
discuss
a
cause,
and
that's
the
language
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
which
is
a
speech
interest,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
justice
kennedy,
if
i
might...
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
predicated
on
lovell,
predicated
on
schneider.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
there
is
discretion
in
this
instance.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
i-
if
i
if
i
might,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
kennedy,
when
we
look
at
the
ordinance
on
appendix
four
a,
and
it's
section
one
sixteen
oh
three
b
six,
it
says
that
the
mayor
can
ask
for
such
other...
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
of
i'm
sorry,
it's
our
brief
for
petitioners,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
page
four
a,
section
b
six,
such
other
information
concerning
the
registrant
and
its
business
or
purpose
as
may
be
reasonably
necessary
to
accurately
describe
the
nature
of
the
privilege
desired.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
no.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
not
at
all.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
no,
it's...
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
justice
breyer,
we
have
not
contested
that
provision
of
the
ordinance,
section
one
sixteen
oh
seven,
which
allows
a
homeowner
to
post
a
no-solicitation
sign
and
then
go
to
the
village
and
say,
i
want
this
group
but
not
this
group,
has
not
been
contested.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
well,
that's
i-
that's
il-
an
expression
of
the
residents'
interest
in
who
they
want.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
your
honor,
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
okay.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
i
think
that's
an
appropriate
point
chief
justice
rehnquist
asked.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
thank
you,
mister
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
it
is,
and
what...
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
had
happened
there,
justice
stevens,
they
would
be
accepted
if
the
box
was
checked
and
they
were
allowed,
and
that
particular
form,
no
one
was
allowed
at
the
door.
mr.
paul
d.
polidoro
that's
the
homeowner's
for-.
