think
that
the
practice
around
the
country
of
various
towns
and
cities
is
to
require
permits
for
people
to
go
door
to
door
in
residential
areas?
i
think
i
even
live
in
a
community
that
probably
does
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
want
to
identify
the
people
who
are
going
door
to
door.
justice
sandra

that.
justice
sandra

o'connor
trick-or-treaters?
do
they
have
to
go
get
a
permit?
justice

o'connor
ordinance
it
looks
like
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
are.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
enforce
it,
but
it
literally
covers
them,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra

o'connor
from
your
neighbor?
do
i
have
to
get
a
permit
to
go
borrow
a
cup
of
sugar
from
my
neighbor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
suggests
that
an
anonymity
requirement
makes
it
content-based.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
disclosure
means
that
it
certainly
is
not
anonymous.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
met,
as
has
already
been
pointed
out,
by
the
opportunity
to
put
up
a
no
trespassing,
no
solicitor
sign.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ordinance
have
to
do
more?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
standard
of
review
should
we
apply,
do
you
suppose,
in
looking
at
this
ordinance?
