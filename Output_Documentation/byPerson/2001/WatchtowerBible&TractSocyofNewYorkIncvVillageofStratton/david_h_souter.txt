justice
david
h.
souter
take
it
your
argument
only
goes
to
the
political
speech,
d-
d-
because
i
unders-
as
i
understand
it,
jehovah's
witnesses
do
not
object
to
identifying
themselves,
and
and
and
your
concern
is
with
the
overbreadth
that
that
goes
into
the
political
sphere,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
applicant
number
five.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
there's
no
there's
that's
the
trouble,
i
mean,
i
think,
with
the
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
saying
it
only
applied
to
to
to
those
who
were
engaged
in
the
political
i
thought
that
was
th-
the
the
point
of
your
overbreadth
objection.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
the
basis
i
understand
the
nub
of
your
argument
is
is
goes
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
i-
in
in
distinguishing
buckley,
and
i
think
what
you
were
saying
was,
in
buckley
the
government
had
an
interest
because
it
had
an
interest
in
checking
the
veracity
of
the
of
of
the
the
the
the
the
endorsement
solicitat-
the
petition
solicitation
process,
are
these
real
people,
go
to
the
person
who
asked
and
check,
whereas
here,
if
we're
not
talking
about
the
solicitation
of
money
and
of
signatures
in
in
a
political
sphere,
there's
nothing
for
the
government
to
verify,
and
therefore
there
is
no
interest
here,
whereas
there
was
an
interest
in
buckley,
and
that's
the
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
e-
example
that

all
of
this.

h.

knows?

mean,

where's
the
restrictive
definition
of
cause?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
and
what're
the
what's
the
language
that
you
rely
on?

david
h.
souter

you're
