and
yet
the
the
question
that
you
phrase
says
that
this
permit,
which
contains
one's
name,
now,
when
we
turn
to
the
village's
brief,
they
say,
no,
it
doesn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
five
times
in
their
brief
that
the
permit
that
must
be
shown
to
the
police
officer
or
the
homeowner
does
not
have
a
name
on
it
does
not
have
a
name
on
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
of
your
examples
was
that
door
to
door
solicitation
of
signatures
for
inti-
an
initiative
to
put
on
the
ballot,
and
that's
exactly
what
was
involved
in
the
buckley
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
been
a
circulator,
then,
because
a
condition
of
being
a
circulator
she
could
not
have
submitted
her
petitions,
because
to
submit
the
petition
she
has
to
have
this
affidavit,
and
i
don't
see
i
really
can't
see
any
difference
in
consequence
whether
the
official
form
is
made
before
or
made
after.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mention
i-
you
you
took
buckley
as
being
a
hundred
percent
in
your
favor,
and
that
what
surprised
me,
is
that
buckley
made
the
very
distinction
that
you
say
is
inappropriate
here,
that
is,
face
to
face
encounter,
you
don't
have
to
have
your
name,
but
back
in
in
an
official's
office,
you
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
any
case
in
the
most
of
the
jehovah
[:
jehovah's]
witnesses
cases
dealt
with
that
official
who
was
exercising
discretion
to
keep
out
the
witnesses
but
letting
in
the
republicans,
and
that
that
was
that
line
of
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i-
only
if
they
speak,
that
the
the
mayor
requires
anybody
who
rings
door
to
door.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
also
may
i
say
there's
language
in
those
cases
that
suggest
that
it
it
would
be
th-
i-
you
read
it
yourself,
this
stranger
has
to
identify
himself
or
herself.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
taken
out
of
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
the
only
thing
that
the
mayor
asks
isn't
wasn't
there
something
in
the
district
court
opinion
that
cut
that
back?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
village
made
a
concession.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
village
if
they
did,
because
i
remember
something
that
said
we're
going
to
ask
only
for
the
name
and
the
address.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
the
provision
that
i
thought
was
out
of
it
because
of
the
concession
that
the
city
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
point
when
the
mayor
said,
all
i'm
going
to
ask
is
the
name
and
the
address?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we're
not
supposed
to
be
resolve
these
b-
back
door
questions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of
the
things
in
this
record
that
you
you
did
delete,
at
one
time
you
gave
the
homeowners
a
choice
specifically
of
u-
jehovah
witnesses
in
or
out,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that,
now
you
deleted
that
but
could
the
could
the
village
say
to
the
homeowner,
it's
your
choice,
you
tell
us
who
you
want
and
you
don't
want,
and
we'll
enforce
that,
so
if
you
don't
want
the
jehovah
witnesses
you
don't
have
to
have
them,
you
don't
want
the
democrats
you
don't
have
to
have
them?
do
would
that
be
permissible
for
the
village
to
do
to
facilitate
the
homeowner's
choice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
it
enforce
u-
that
private
discrimination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
the
state
assists
that
private
choice
i
mean
we're
not
we're
talking
about
limitations
on
the
state,
not
on
the
homeowner.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
homeowner
said,
only
caucasian
solicitors?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
how
is
that
any
different
from
no
jehovah
witnesses?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
got
it
from?
i
i
don't
think
it
was
original
with
this
village,
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
the
city
say,
to
facilitate
the
homeowners'
choice,
we're
going
to
say,
nobody
rings
bells
for
anything,
but
the
homeowner
the
home
make
the
homeowner
the
one
to
come
to
sign
up
in
city
hall
to
say,
i
don't
mind
having
solicitors?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
j-
in
in
order
to
meet
the
objection
that
the
solicitors
don't
want
to
sign
up,
or
the
canvassers
don't
want
to
sign
up,
the
city
says,
well,
i-
we'll
just
i-
sh-
have
a
total
ban
on
ringing
doorbells,
but
any
homeowner
who
wants
to
have
it
can?
