mr.
abraham
cantor
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
abraham
cantor
your
honor,
there's
no
holding
by
this
court
that
identifies...
mr.
abraham
cantor
there
is
no
case
that
identifies
a
breadth
of
this
case,
but
perhaps
that
might
be
part
of
the
beauty,
beauty
in
the
sense
that
it
is
it
is
content-neutral,
mr.
abraham
cantor
no,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
cantor
your
honor...
mr.
abraham
cantor
the
answer
is
no,
and...
mr.
abraham
cantor
the
track
rec-
i-
the
track...
mr.
abraham
cantor
that
hypothetical
was
raised
by
the
trial
court
judge,
your
honor,
mr.
abraham
cantor
and
it
was
answered
by
mr.
bruzzese
to
the
to
the
negative,
the
reason
why
it
was
answered
to
the
negative
is
that
these
people
are
not
who
are
going
door
to
door
are
not
seeking
u-
to
communicate,
they
are
s-
they
are
begging
candy,
and...
mr.
abraham
cantor
sale
sale
would
would
constitute
a
conduct
that
would...
mr.
abraham
cantor
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that...
mr.
abraham
cantor
the
limiting
language,
your
honor,
deals
with
canvassing
and
hawking
of
the
u-
of
the
area.
mr.
abraham
cantor
no,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
cantor
because
it
is
not
the
type
of
cause
that
u-
that
the
communication
is...
mr.
abraham
cantor
within
the
beginning
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
abraham
cantor
i'm
looking
at
section
one
sixteen
point
zero
three.
mr.
abraham
cantor
no
canvasser,
solicitor,
peddlar,
hawker,
itinerant
merchant,
or
transient
vendor
of
merchandise
or
services
who
is
described
in
one
sixteen
point
zero
one
of
this
chapter,
and
who
intends
to
go
o-
in
or
upon
private
property,
or
a
private
resident
of
the
village,
for
any
other
purposes
described
in
point
zero
one,
shall
go
in
or
upon
such
private
property
or
residence
without
first
registering.
mr.
abraham
cantor
the
district
court
determined
th-
that
they
were
canvassers.
mr.
abraham
cantor
city's
purpose
is
to
prevent
annoyance...
mr.
abraham
cantor
city
of
the
property
owner.
mr.
abraham
cantor
want
to
be...
mr.
abraham
cantor
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
is
not...
mr.
abraham
cantor
the
purpose
is
to
prevent
th-
the
p-
the
purpose
of
the
registration,
is
the
initial
registration...
mr.
abraham
cantor
to
identify
who
in
the
community
is
going
door
to
door.
mr.
abraham
cantor
because
of
two
factors,
the
f-
privacy
of
the
oh
person
who
lives
with...
mr.
abraham
cantor
i-
in
martin
versus
struthers,
your
honor,
in
footnote
five,
this
court
relied
upon
the
utilization
of
a
book
as
well
as
an
fbi
bulletin
to
determine
that
those
who
go
door
to
door
may
be
doing
so
as
a
guise.
mr.
abraham
cantor
that
provision
is
a
catch-all
to
determine
or
make
sure
that
the
identifying
identifying
information
is
present,
the
identification
o-
of
the
individual
as
well...
mr.
abraham
cantor
the
first
five
sections
of
that
subsection
give
the
information.
mr.
abraham
cantor
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
cantor
i'm
going
to
suggest
to
your
honor
that
it
does,
and
the
reason
that
it
does
is
because
it
i
it
requires
identification
information,
and
that
identification
information
is
necessary
regardless
of
whether
someone
is
going
to
solicit
funds,
or
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
going
t-
going
to
go
door
to
door
for
some
other...
mr.
abraham
cantor
u-
the
determination
of
the
nature
and
the
amount
of
risk
is
perhaps
highlighted
by
macmurray's
testimony.
mr.
abraham
cantor
your
honor,
the
issue
the
issue
in
at
the
registration
aspect
deals
with
that
we
are
not
at
the
point
of
persuasion.
mr.
abraham
cantor
y-
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
you
resolve
it
based
on
the
record.
mr.
abraham
cantor
your
honor,
this
case
was
tried
on
the
registration
requirement.
mr.
abraham
cantor
no,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
cantor
of
the
of
the
language.
mr.
abraham
cantor
the
display,
there
is
a
display
of
the
permit
required
on
demand.
mr.
abraham
cantor
yes,
your...
mr.
abraham
cantor
the
village
would
be
acting
as
a
bulletin
board.
mr.
abraham
cantor
your
honor,
there
is
no
requirement
that
anyone
decide
that
anyone
allow
someone
else
to
come
into
their
home
w-
if
whether
for
a
good
or
a
bad
purpose.
mr.
abraham
cantor
well,
we
are
only
assisting
that
u-
u-
that
the
u-
prior
cases
that
this
court
has
considered
deals
with
the
government
being
some
type
of
a
censor
or
limiter
of
the
speech
that
is
going.
mr.
abraham
cantor
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
invalid
on
its
face.
mr.
abraham
cantor
because
the
issue
there
is
that
this
is
a
speech
that
is
not
that
they
do
not
wish
to
a-
to
accept.
mr.
abraham
cantor
well,
the
the
the
issue
here,
your
honor,
is
dealing
with
whether
or
not
this
is
a
consensual
intrusion.
mr.
abraham
cantor
that
would
be
appropriate
to
c-
mr.
abraham
cantor
thank
you,
your
honor.
