justice
john
paul
stevens
i-
as
i
looked
at
page
one
ninety-nine
and
i
thought
that
was
a
list
of
exceptions
to
the
to
the
ordinance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
in
other
words
the
trick-or-treaters
are
expressly
excepted,
just
like
christmas
carollers
and
the
others...
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
the
person
applying
for
the
ordinance
has
to
check
all
these
things
to

justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
petitioners
are
jehovah’s
witnesses
who
go
from
door-to-door
distributing
religious
materials.
they
brought
this
action
against
the
village
of
stratton,
ohio
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
an
ordinance
that
prohibits
canvassers
from
going
on
private
property
to
promote
any
cause
without
first
obtaining
a
permit
from
the
mayor’s
office.
the
district
court
upheld
the
ordinance
and
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
the
ordinance
violates
the
first
amendment.
we
note
that
the
ordinance
covers
far
more
than
commercial
activity
and
the
solicitation
of
funds.
it
applies
to
religions
and
political
activity
and
would
same
to
extend
the
spontaneous
speech
on
a
sunday
afternoon
of
a
neighbor
who
decided
to
ring
a
neighbor’s
doorbell
and
ask
him
to
vote
against
mayor
at
the
next
election
or
something
like
that.
for
reasons
stated,
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
we
conclude
that
the
ordinance
is
a
species
of
a
prior
restraint
that
is
not
tailored
to
protecting
the
village
residents
from
fraud,
from
invasions
of
their
privacy
or
from
crime.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
breyer
joined
by
justices
souter
and
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
on
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined,
and
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
