justice
antonin
scalia
have
no
objection
to
this
statute
if
if
you
didn't
have
to
give
your
name?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
say,
you
can't
talk
to
anybody
without
getting
a
permit,
so
long
as
you
don't
have
to
give
your
name
when
you
get
the
permit?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
that's
the
only
problem,
so
if
if
this
were
revised
somehow
so
that
all
you
had
to
give
was
a
reference,
maybe
somebody
in
the
community
who
would
vouch
for
the
integrity
of
these
jehovah's
witnesses,
that
would
then
be
okay,
justice
antonin
scalia
is
if
they
have
to
give
their
name.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
handle
your
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
a
petition
circulator.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say
that
w-
w-
w-
w-
without
reference
to
the
name.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
of
course,
to
do
that
we
would
just
say,
you
can't
require
the
name
to
be
disclosed.
justice
antonin
scalia
photograph
taken,
maybe,
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
confused
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
you
do
w-
not
want
to
have
to
go
to
city
hall
in
order
to
ring...
justice
antonin
scalia
take
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
other
any
other
case
of
ours
that
has
even
involved
an
ordinance
of
this
breadth,
that
involves
solicitation,
not
asking
for
money,
not
selling
goods,
but
even,
you
know,
i
want
to
talk
about
jesus
christ,
or
i
want
to
talk
about
about
protecting
the
environment?
no-
di-
i-
is
there
have
we
had
a
case
like...
justice
antonin
scalia
fact
that
i-
that
i'm
unfamiliar
with
something
like
maybe
they've
become
current
now,
but
the
mere
fact
that
i
don't
even
know
of
such
cases,
over
two
centuries,
makes
me...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
d-
i
d-
justice
antonin
scalia
a
holding,
a
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they're
soliciting,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
really
a
novel
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
we're
concerned
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
also
petitioner's
page
three...
justice
antonin
scalia
same
yeah
i
mean,
un-
unless
you're
interpreting
canvasser
very
literally,
in
which
case
it
wouldn't
include
jehovah's
witnesses
why
are
jehovah's
witnesses
covered?
are
are
they
canvassers,
solicitors,
peddlers,
hawkers,
itinerant
merchants
or
transient
vendors
of
merchandise
or
services?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
none
of
those,
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
you
have
a
very
broad
definition
of
canvassers
if
it
includes
jehovah's
wit-
i
i
i
would
have
thought
a
canvasser
is
just
somebody
who
said,
i'm
doing
a
survey,
i'm
canvassing
public
opinion,
or
something
like
that,
but
if
it's
if
it
includes
jehovah's
witnesses,
it
certainly
includes
the
the
the
you
know,
the
the
the
the
garbage
u-
ca-
canvasser,
u-
so...
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
b-
be,
and
i
suppose
you
could
say
everybody
who
gets
up
on
a
soap-
soapbox
may
may
provoke
a
riot,
but
you
know,
there
the-
this
seems
to
me
one
of
the
normal
risks
of
life
that
doesn't
let
the
government
go
around.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
you
know,
i'm
the
the
th-
that's
that's
a
common
common
ploy
of
people
who
want
to
commit
a
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
minor
risk
of
a
o-
of
a
crime
occurring
is
enough
to
re-
to
require
everybody
who
wants
to
ring
a
doorbell
to
register
at
city
hall?
of
course
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean,
it
it
originally
was
that
they
just
didn't
want
to
register,
a-
anonymous
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
very
nice.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you're
envisioning
little
little
little
cottages
with
a
pathway
up
to
the
door.
justice
antonin
scalia
th-
w-
the
they
don't
have
a
setback
restriction,
the
door
is
right,
you
know,
right
on
the
public
public
sidewalks,
knocks
on
the
door.
justice
antonin
scalia
think
you
can
say
that
the
difference
is
that
this
involves
only
speech
that
occurs
on
private
property,
not
necessarily.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
concerned
about
people
who
were
even
not
concerned
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
thief
who
is
willing
to
to
rape
and
and
burgle,
but
is
but
stops
short
of
failing
to
register
at
city
hall,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
gives
your
citizens
great
confidence
that
laugh>
justice
antonin
scalia
how
necessary
is
it?
we
we
can
all
stipulate
that
the
safest
societies
in
the
world
are
totalitarian
dictatorships.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
the
the
mayor
here
said
i
i-
in
his
testimony
it's
on
three
eighty-five
a
of
the
appe-
i
nev-
i've
never
i
i
never
have
denied
anybody
a
permit.
