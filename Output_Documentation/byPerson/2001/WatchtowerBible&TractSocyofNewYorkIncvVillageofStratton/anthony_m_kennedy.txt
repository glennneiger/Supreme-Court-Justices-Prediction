justice
anthony
m.

well,
i-
th-
th-
th-
do
you
focus
on
the
right
of
anonymity,
or
the
the
right
of
unrestricted
speech,
as
of
the
time
you
get
to
the
door,
or
when
you
go
to
the
mayor's
office,
because
our
most
recent
cases
talk
about
going
to
the
door,
and
that's
where
your
brief
focuses
on.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you've
begun
with,
and
this
is
also
troubling
to
me,
is
that
you
have
to
make
the
disclosure
to
the
mayor
as
well,
those
ar-
so
i
take
it
those
are
two
different
parts
of
your
case.
[inaudible]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
emphasize
only
the
latter,
really,
in
your
briefs.
are
are
the
records
that
the
mayor
keeps,
are
they
open
to
the
public?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is?
i
i
i
agree
that
at
some
level
it
seems
contrary
to
our
traditions,
but
if
we
can
focus
just
on
going
to
the
mayor's
office,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
strong-
parts
of
your
case
is
did
you
have
to
identify
your
cause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
wrong
with
identifying
the
cause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
the
that
the
mayor,
in
my
view,
or
the
the
the
government
has
no
right
to
demand
f-
previous
registration
or
to
give
his
consent
before
i
go
to
my
neighbors
to
talk
about
neighborhood
problems,
or
whatever.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
best
case,
or
best
what
are
your
best
cases
for
the
proposition
that
it
is
simply
unconstitutional
for
the
government
to
require
a
permit
before
you
go
door
to
door
to
talk
about
a
cause?
what
are
your
best...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
most
of
those
cases
i
i
i
think
they're
the
closest,
too,
but
they're
not
right
on
point,
because
they
were
concerned
with
the
discretion...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
official
had...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
position
is,
of
course,
that
governments
always
want
to
know
what
its
people
are
thinking,
but
they
don't
have
any
right
to
find
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
your
clients.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
you
think
it's
it's
it's
a
beautiful
idea
that
i
have
to
ask
the
government
for
permission
before
i
go
down
the
block,
where
i
don't
know
all
of
the
people,
i
wave
to
them
but
i
don't
really
know
them,
i
say,
i
want
to
talk
to
you
because
i'm
concerned
about
the
garbage
pick-up,
because
i'm
concerned
about
our
congressman,
whatever.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,

martin
has
to
do
with
solicitation
of
funds.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
we
were
talking
about
whether
or
not
you
can
just
at
least
give
your
name,
said
this
is
necessary
for
those
who
solicit
funds,
but
your
ordinance
goes
much
bu-
sweeps
much
more
widely
than
the
solicitation
of
funds,
so
footnote

doesn't
support
the
ordinance
that
r-
is
now
before
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
there
are
many
m-
m-
m-
m-
gated,
so
called
private
communities
where
the
solicitor
can
never
go
in
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
way
they
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
guess
you're
just
trying
to
give
your
residents
the
protection
that
people
have
when
they
live
in
closed
enclaves.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
i
i
haven't
seen
any
cases
about
those
closed
enclaves.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
have
always
said
that
that
picketing
is
a
a
activity
which
i-
which
is
focused,
it's
constant,
it
repeats
a
message
over
a
long
period
of
time,
and
that's
that's
simply
different
from
a
a
single
encounter,
which
is
what
you
prevent.

standard,
aren't
you
re-
isn't
the
government
required
to
show
that
it
restricts
no
more
speech
than
is
reasonably
necessary
to
accomplish
its
interests?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
find
a
single

reporting

that
has
ever
