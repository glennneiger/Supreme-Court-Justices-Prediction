so
so
the
basic
statutory
problem
i
think
you
i
i
see
where
you're
you're
debating
whether
you
become
entitled
after
five
months
or
twelve
months,
and
that
seems
to
turn
on
the
language
in
seventy
a.
justice

breyer
problem
is,
to
be
absolutely
frank,
i
think
you
could
b-
read
it
at
that
level
severity
or
you
don't
have
to
read
it
at
that
level
of
severity.

all

an
animal,
you
certainly
can
read
in
that
it
doesn't
mean
fleas.
justice
stephen
g.

so
you
have
to
make
some
assumption.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
before
y-
can
i
just
ask
you
quickly
if
you're
s-
simply
repeating
these,
which
i
is
that
o-
on
question
two,
am
i
right
in
thinking
we
don't
reach
question
two
if
you
lose
on
question
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
i
didn't
understand
is
if
you
lose
on
question
one
and
your
client
therefore
is
not
entitled
to
social
security,
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
end
of
the
case?
we
don't
have
to
reach
question
two.

justice
stephen
g.

to
decide,
for
whatever
theories
you
may
have,
whether
he
is
or
is
not
entitled.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
a
social
security
act
case
that
deals
with
a
provision
that
defines
benefits
for
disabled
people
and
it
defines
disability
as
"an
inability
to
engage
in
any
substantial
gainful
activity
by
reason
of
any
medically
determinable
physical
or
mental
impairment
which
can
be
expected
to
result
in
death
or
which
has
lasted
or
can
be
expected
to
last
for
a
continuous
period
of
not
less
than
12
months."
now,
the
case
raises
two
questions
about
that
definition:
first,
consider
a
person
say
has
serious
high
blood
pressure
and
that
high
blood
pressure
which
is
his
physical
impairment
lasts
for
more
than
12
months,
so
that
fit
within
the
definition,
but
his
inability
to
engage
in
substantial
gainful
employment
i.e.
his
inability
to
work
lasts
for
only
5
or
6
months
and
as
he
returns
to
work
early
but
he
still
has
the
disease.
well
does
he
qualify?
does
most
of
the
disability
and
the
inability
to
work
have
to
last
for
the
12
months
or
is
it
good
enough
to
just
the
impairment
last
for
12
months?
well
for
the
last
40
years
the
social
security
agencies
said
both.
you
have
to
both
have
the
impairment
and
you
cannot
work
for
the
12
months,
but
the
fourth
circuit
decided
that
that
was
unlawful
so
we
reviewed
that,
and
in
our
opinion
the
social
security
agency's
determination
is
lawful.
it
has
been
the
statute
at
least
ambiguous
on
the
point
and
their
decision
that
how
to
interpret
that
statute
is
a
reasonable
one,
so
we
uphold
their
decision.
now,
the
second
question
was
what
about
a
person,
the
same
person,
he
comes
back
to
work
after
5
months,
and
his
argument
is
well
i
maybe
i
did
come
back
after
5
months
instead
of
12,
but
the
statute
uses
the
word
expected
to
last
more
than
12
months
and
it
was
a
surprise
that
i
came
back;
i
could
have
been
expected
to
stay
out
for
more
than
12
months.
now,
can
he
make
that
argument?
well,
again
the
social
security
agency
said,
no,
you
did
return
after
5
months
and
that
is
the
end
of
it,
you
got
back
before
the
12
month
period
that
is
the
end
of
it.
the
fourth
circuit
thought
the
agency
was
wrong
but
we
again
say
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous
on
the
point
and
their
determination
is
reasonable
so
we
uphold
the
agency.
if
you
would
like
to
read
more
about
it,
it
is
all
set
out
in
our
opinion.
our
decision
is
unanimous,
except
to
its
part
two
in
respect
to
which
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
