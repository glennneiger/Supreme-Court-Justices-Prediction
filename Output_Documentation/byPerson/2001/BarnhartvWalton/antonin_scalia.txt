the
the
difference
is
the
other
side
says
that
he
becomes
entitled
not
when
he
is
adjudicated
to
be
entitled,
but
he
becomes
entitled
when,
in
fact,
all
of
the
conditions
exist
for
which
the
be-
the
benefits
are
payable.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
right
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
not
allow
him
to
come
in
and
say
long
before
i
came
in
for
an
adjudication,
i
was
in
fact
disabled
and
entitled
to
benefits.

pryor,

what
time
limit
do
you
pick?
i

suppose
a
person
has
a
disability
that
i-
indeed
w-
is
expected
to
last
more
than
twelve
months
but
it
only
has
caused
him
to
black
out
and
be
incapable
of
working
for

i'm
reading
from
my
own
copy
of
the...
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
that
a
person
who
has
been
getting
benefits
may
be
determined
not
to
be
entitled
to
benefits
on
the
basis
of
a
finding
that
the
physical
or
mental
impairment,
on
the
basis
of
which
such
benefits
are
provided,
has
ceased,
does
not
exist,
or
is
not
disabling
only
if
such
finding
is
supported
by.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
it
requires,
and
that
therefore
the
individual
is
able
to
engage
in
substantial
gainful
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
would
apply
to
termination
gives
you
some
indication
of
of
what
what
the
initial
condition
is
is
expected
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
continuous
inability
to
to
to
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
severity
requirement
has
nothing
to
do
with
duration,
and
this
termination
provision
suggests
that
it
does
have
something
to
do
with...
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
engage
in
any
substantial
gainful
activity,
you're
terminated,
assuming
that
there's
been
the
improvement
in
the
condition.
justice
antonin
scalia
think
you're
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
two
hinges
on
question
if
you
lose
on
question
one,
you
lose
on
question
two,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
d-
d-
do
you
agree
with
the
government's
estimate
that
m-
that
if
if
you
win
in
this
case,
the
difference
in
in
payouts
under
this
program
is
going
to
be
something
like
eight
billion
dollars
a
year?
is
it
is
it
that
excessive?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
asked.
