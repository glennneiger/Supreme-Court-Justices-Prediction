don't
emphasize
the
word
which.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
focus
on
the
word
which.
justice
john
paul
stevens
expect
the
inability
to
be
expected
to
last
to
result
in
death
where
it
lasted
for
a
continuous
period
of
twelve
months?
i
don't
know
why.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
you
don't
think
it
means
both
of
which
can
be
expected,
just
means
one
of
which
can
be
expected.
justice

one
week
after
the
five
month
period
the
person
goes
back
to
work?
would
that
mean
they
just
got
benefits
for
a
week?
justice
john
paul
stevens
improvement
b-
be
the
ability
to
go
back
to
work
which
they
could
not
do
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
also
ask
you?
i
know
you
think
it
not
legally
significant,
but
do
you
disagree
with
the
government's
position
that
they
have
consistently
interpreted
the
statute
in
this
way
for
forty
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
you
agree
that
they
correctly
describe
the
legislative
deliberations
in
nineteen
fifty-six
i
think
it
was?
but
you
just
say
they're
totally
irrelevant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
other
thing
i
just
wonder
about
in
a
case
like
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
but
i
mean
the
twelve
months
versus
five
months
as
the...
justice
john
paul
stevens
argued
this
before
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
one
question?
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
haven't
missed
something
in
the
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you,
you're
saying
that
the
impair-
that
the
severity
requirement
is
an
inability
to
engage
in
substantial
work.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
i
i
i
really
have
trouble
understanding
that
if
there's
a
seber-
severity
requirement
measured
by
inability
to
work
for
a
period
of
time,
why
that
severity
requirement
wouldn't
continue
for
the
entire
period
under
the
statutory
definition
of
impairment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
so,
but
the
but
the
but
the
disability
has
a
durational
requirement
and
it's
not
a
disability
unless
it's
severe
enough.
