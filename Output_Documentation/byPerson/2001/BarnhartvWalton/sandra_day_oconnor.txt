well,
now,
presumably
though,
as
i
understand
it,
the
commissioner
could
evaluate
a
claim
and
start
benefits
in
less
than
twelve
months.
[inaudible]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
disregard
possibly
periods
of
work
during
that
period
if
the
commission
is
satisfied
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
permanent
impairment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
seems
sort
of
inconsistent
with
your
view
on
the
second
question
that
trial
work
periods
shouldn't
begin
until
the
end
of
the
twelve
months.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
what
provision
in
the
language
of
the
statute
says
that
you
can't
start
a
trial
work
period
until
the
end
of
twelve
months?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
unless
the
benefits
have
started.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
but...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
trial
work
statute
itself
says
that
any
services
rendered
by
an
individual
during
a
period
of
trial
work
shall
be
deemed
not
to
have
been
rendered
in
determining
whether
his
disability
has
ceased.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
give
here?
at
the
time
this
claim
was
evaluated,
the
regulations
hadn't
been
adopted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
skidmore
rather
than
chevron?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
at
the
word
impairment
and
what
it
means,
you
get
back
to
the
a-
inability
to
do
substantial
gainful
employment
for
that
interval
of
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
refers
to
question
two.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
on
question
two,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
there
is
substantial
agreement
in
the
courts
of
appeals
that
you're
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
not
the
case
with
question
one.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
position
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
decided,
that
the
statute
itself
says...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
person
is
entitled
at
the
end
of
the
five
months.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
decision
maker.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
tell
us
what's
happened
to
the
respondent
in
the
interim?
