mr.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
congress
descri-
des-
congress
designed
the
social
security
disability
programs
to
provide
benefits
to
workers
who
suffered
from
long
term
disabilities,
individuals
who
were,
in
effect,
forced
into
premature
reti-
retirement
by
a
severe
impairment.
consistent
with
the
program's
origin...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
consistent
with
the
program's
origin,
purpose,
and
text,
the
commissioner
has,
for
forty-five
years,
from
the
program's
incetion
[:
inception]
in
adjudicating
tens
of
millions
of
claims,
and
throughout
repeated
amendments,
adhered
to
a
single
and
consistent,
reasonable
construction
of
the
definition
of
disability.
to
be
disabled,
a
claimant
must
have
an
impairment
that
has
lasted
or
can
be
expected
to
last
at
twelve
m-
least
twelve
months
at
a
disabling
level
of
severity,
that
is,
the
impairment
must
preclude
substantial
gainful
activity
for
the
twelve
months
during
which
it
must
last.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
correct,
your
honor.
that's
preci-
that's
because
the
statute
allows
the
commissioner
to
award
benefits
if
the
im-
if
the
disabling
impairment
can
be
expected
to
last
twelve
months.
so,
a-
for...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
purpos-
and...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
if
the
work
does
not
evidence
an
ability
to
engage
in
substantial
gainful
activity.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
no.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
again,
it's
not
our
position
that
you
can't
start
a
work
period
a
trial
work
period
nintel
[:
until]
and
the
end
of
t-
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right,
unless
they
are
entitled
to
benefits.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
bottom
where
it's
numbered
three.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
and
it
says,
a
p-
tr-
a
period
of
trial
work
for
any
individual
shall
begin
with
the
month
in
which
he
becomes
entitled
to
disability
insurance
benefits.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
because
the
statute
provies
[:
provides]
that
the
individual
is
entitled
to
benefits
if
he
has
a
disability
which
can
be
expected
to
last
twelve
months
or
has
lasted
twelve
months.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right,
in
determining
whether
his
disability
has
ceased.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
i
think
you've
precisely
described
our
position,
justice
souter.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
actually
the
contrary
view
would
make
creates
a
rather...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
of
adjudication
to
make
and
one
that's
entirely
foreign
to
the
law.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
not
merely
that.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
yes,
exactly.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
correct...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
the
commissioner
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference
like
regardless
of
when
the
claim
was
adjudicated.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
focusing
on
the
language...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
statute
imposes
two
requirements.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it's
four
twenty-three
d
two
a
and
d
one
a
which
appear
on
pages
sixty-nine
just
the
heading
of
d
one
appears
on
sixty-nine
a
and
seventy
a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
turning
at
page
seventy,
th-
it
p-
establishes
two
requirements
that
are
interrelated.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
justice
scalia,
that
might
be
one
way
of
reading
the
statute,
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
we
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i-
in
effect,
we're
arguing,
yes,
that
the
type
of
impairment
that
congress
was
referring
to
is
an
impairment
that
prevents
substantial
gainful
activity
because
that's
the
type
of
impairment
that
is
referenced
in
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it
is
not
the
type
of
impairment
that
you
must
have
for
twelve
months.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
one
way
you
could
lo-
you
could
put
your
p-
emphasis
on
the
word
impairment.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
as
a
grammatical
matter,
justice
stevens,
we
have
to
confess
that
the
word
which
refers
to
the
impairment
because
one
would
not
inordinarily
[:
ordinarily]
expect
the
substantial
gainful
activity
to
result
in
death
or
the
inability
better
still,
the
inability
to
engage
in
substantial
gainful
activity
to
result
in
death.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
justice
stevens,
we'd
be
perfectly
willing
to
accept
that
if
that
were
your
view,
but
for
purpose
of
this
case,
we
we
have
for
grammatical
purposes,
we
believe
that
the
phrase,
which
can
be
expected
to
result
in
death,
modifies
the
impairment,
not
the
inability
to
engage
in
substantial
gainful
act-
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i-
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it's
on
s-
page
seventy-one
a,
justice
scalia,
after
the
numeral
three
of
the
joint
of
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
impairment
is
what
results
from
the
abnormalities.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
so,
if
i-
the
condition
is,
in
this
case
schizophrenia,
the
impairment
would
be
the
inability
to
focus,
the
inability
to
p-
think
clearly,
the
impairment
of
the
cognitive
functions
is
another
way
of
putting
it.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i-
th-
i
that
that
is
part
of
the
definition
of
substantial
gainful
activity.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it
probabl-
it
it
the
substantiality
does
modify
the
intensity
of
the
activity,
but
when
terms
of
determining
what
kind
of
evidence
shows
that
you're
able
to
engage
in
that
activity,
the
commissioner
has
legislative
authority
to
determine
whether
work
excuse
me,
whether
certain
types
of
work
attempts
evidence
your
ability
to
engage
in
substantial
gainful
activity.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
in
fact,
your
honor,
there
were
two
adjudications
in
this
case
in
a
very
short
period
of
time
within
the
filing
of
benefits.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
i
have
do
not
have
any
information
regarding
that.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
we
believe
this
is
a
a
classic
case
of
chevron
deference.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
oh,
well,
that
would
be
classically
me-
if
you're
what
you're
referring
to
i-
is
mead
or
skidmore
deference,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well...
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i-
i-
those
are
the
two
f-
standards
of
deference
with
which
i'm
familiar,
and
in
fact
we
believe
that
we'd
win
under
either
one.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
it
may
it
certainly
adds
weight
to
the
re-
agency's
view
and
it
may
make
it
so
that
there
is
only
one
reasonable
construction
of
a
statute
this
ambiguous.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
five
month
trial
work
excuse
me,
the
five
month
waiting
period.
