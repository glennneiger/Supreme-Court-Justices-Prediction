[:
mr.]
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
this
case
is
governed
by
the
plain
language
of
the
statutes,
the
language
of
the
disability
definition,
which
is
the
primary
focus
of
the
first
issue
presented,
and
the
language
of
the
trial
work
period
and
entitlement
statutes,
which
are
the
primary
focus
of
the
second
issue
presented.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
no,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
the
entitlement
statute
i
believe...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
shows
that
a
person
must
be
under
a
disability
during
the
five
month
waiting
period.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
waiting
period.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
entitlement
statute,
your
honor,
which
is
set
out
at
four
twenty-three
a...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
which
is
found
at
on
page
sixty-four
a
and
sixty-five
a.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
i'm
sorry.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
the
beginning,
right
after
d.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
shall
be
entitled
to
a
disability
insurance
benefit
for
each
month
beginning
with
the
first
month
after
his
waiting
period.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
yes,
ma'am.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
your
honor,
he
because
the
trial
work
period
statute
dictates
that
a
person
is
entitled
to
a
trial
work
period
beginning
in
the
first
month
he's
entitled
to
benefits,
he
would
be
entitled
to
benefits
beginning
in
april
nineteen
ninety-five,
which
is
when
he
met
all
criteria
of
entitlement,
and
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
trial
work
period
beginning
that
month.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
and
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
he
returned
to
substantial
ga-
well,
he
returned
to
any
work
in
may
of
nineteen
ninety-five,
and
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
nine
month
trial
work
period
plus
the
additional
three
months,
and
then
for
any
months
during
that
thirty-six
month
entitlement
reentitlement...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
it
would
be
his
his
actual
work
started
end
of
may
june,
then
nine
months,
plus
additional
three
months,
so
approximately
fourteen
months
i
believe.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
that's
correct.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
well,
your
honor,
my
response
is
that
that
requires
this
court
to
read
language
into
the
into
the...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
reading
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
commissioner
has
conceded
this
point
that
th-
the
phrase,
which
can
be
expected
to
result
in
death
and
which
has
lasted
or
can
be
expected
to
last
for
at
least
twelve
months,
refers
to
the
impairment,
not
to
the
inability
to
g-
engage
in
substantial
gainful
activity.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
i'm
sorry.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
your
honor,
i
believe
the
entitlement
provisions
answer
that
question.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
i
believe
that
the
entitlement
statute
requires
that
it
be
disabling
for
at
least
five
months,
the
whit-
the
waiting
period.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
that's
correct.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
yes.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
i
believe
what
this
was
referring
to
your
honor,
is
that
the
medical
improvement
must
or
in
this
case
the
new
or
or
improved
diagnostic
techniques,
must
result
in
that
person's
then
their
condition
no
longer
being
of
such
severity
as
to
prevent
substantial
gainful
activity.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
your
your
honor,
i
believe
that
this
whole
section
refers
to
termination
of
disability...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
th-
there
is
a
severity
requirement
which
is
part
of
the
the
definition,
yes.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
your
honor,
once
there
is
improvement
and
and
you
are
now
able
to
engage
in
substantial
gainful
activity,
i
would
agr-
-gree
that
you
could
be
terminated.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
no,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
their
ability
to
go
back
to
the
fact
that
they
had
gone
back
to
work
would
then
be
c-
protected
by
a
trial
work
period,
and
tha-
and
would
be
that
the
fact
that
they
were
working
would
not
be
able
to
be
considered
as
evidence
that
they
were
no
longer
disabled.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
i
would
agree
that
they
have
consistently
as-
interpreted
the
statute...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
well,
your
honor,
i
would
i
have
referred
to
the
legislative
history
in
nineteen
fifty-four,
which
is
when
that
definition
of
disability
was
first
in-
defined,
and
in
that
instance,
the
nineteen
fifty-four
senate
report
delineated
two
aspects
of
disability
evaluation,
a
medically
determinable
impairment
of
serious
proportions
which
is
expected
to
be
of
long
continued
and
indefinite
duration
and
a
present
inability
to
engage
in
substantial
gainful
activity
by
reason
of
that
impairment.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
well,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
question
one
has
been
ruled
on
differently
by
different
courts.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
we
do.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
agree
with
that.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
is...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
no,
sir.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
that's
what
i
disagree...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
definition
of
disability
isn't
the
final
part
of
that
because
a
person
can
if
the
entitlement
statute
requires
a
prospective
consideration
of
the
criteria
of
entitlement,
a
p-
every
person
who's
insured,
has
not
attained
retirement
age,
has
filed
an
application,
is
under
a
disability
shall
be
entitled
to
disability
insurance
benefits
for
each
month
beginning
with
the
first
month
after
his
waiting
period.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
he
had
a
disability
even
if
you
look
at...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
if
he
even
if
there
was
at
that
time
an
expectation
that
his
inability
to
engage
in
substantial
gainful
activity
must
last
twelve...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
if
he's
never...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
he
is
not
entitled
to
a...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
difference
with
what
you're
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
he
can
be
entitled
even
if
you
find
the
duration
applies
to
the
inability
to
engage
in...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
and
that
is
because
the
entitlement
statute
is
a
prospective
standard
from
the
point
of
application,
and
the...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
yes,
your...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
thank
you.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
[inaudible]
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
your
honor,
that
is
set
out
in
d
two
of
four
twenty-three,
which
is
it's
found
at
page
seventy
a.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
well,
but
yes,
b-
in
considering
you
can't
do
your
past
work
or
other
work
considering
age,
education,
and
work
experience.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
the
severity
requirement
does
not
have
a
durati-
durational
element
to
it.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
well,
the
impairment
has
a...
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
and
and
there
is
a
separate
severity
requirement,
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
statute
says
that
that
it
must
last
at
that
level
of
severity
for
twelve
months.
ms.
kathryn
l.
pryor
your
honor,
he
subse-
this
is
not
in
the
record,
but
he
subsequently
reapplied
and
is
on
disability
benefits
based
on
the
subsequent
application.
