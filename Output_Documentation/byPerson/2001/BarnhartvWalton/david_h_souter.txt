t-
i
thought
you
did
not
take
the
position
in
your
brief
that
as
a
matter
of
law
there
had
to
be
an
adjudication.
justice
david
h.
souter
thought
you
said
that
ordinarily
that's
the
way
it
it
it
works
in
practice,
but
that
the
real
point
you
were
making
was
that
if
the
individual
went
back
to
work
prior
to
the
adjudication
and
therefore
showed
that
in
fact
the
disability
or
or
the
incapacity
and
hence
the
the
the
disability,
as
you
see
it,
is
is
not
going
to
last,
that
that
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.

present
tense
is
that
it
kind
of
gives
an
opportunity

the
application
of

rule.

that
falls
in,
technically,
a
deference
category,
but
it
gets
you
to
the
same
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
but
if
if
we
determine
that
in
fact
the
disability
level
must
be
as
the
government
claims,
then
in
a
case
in
which
the
determination
is
made
before
the
twelve
month
period
and
at
that
time
the
person
is
back
working
at
a
substantial
level
so
that
the
determination
is
properly
made
that
the
person
never
qualified,
then
there
would
be
no
r-
reason,
in
a
case
like
that,
ever
to
proceed
to
the
second
question.

ok-
okay.
