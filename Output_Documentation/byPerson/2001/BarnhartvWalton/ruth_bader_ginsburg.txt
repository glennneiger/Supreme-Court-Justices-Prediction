see,
my
understanding
of
your
position
is
y-
you're
saying
that
impairment,
given
the
context
of
the
statute,
means
a
constantly,
continuously
disabling
impairment,
and
disabling
means
that
you
are
not
equipped
to
engage
in
substantial
what-
whatever
sga
stands
substantial
gainful
activity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
it
isn't
if
it
doesn't
prevent
substantial
gainful
activity,
then
it
isn't
an
impairment
within
the
meaning
of
the
section.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
th-
actually
not
because
you
can
have
these,
u-
not
the
trial
work,
but
the
unsuccessful
work
episodes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
is
unusual
on
the
facts
because
he
came
very
close
to
making
the
one
year
limit,
and
there
is
the
anomaly
that,
say,
the
person
is
approved
for
receiving
disability
benefits
in
month
eight
and
then
will
be
able
to
go
on
for
two
months
past
the
time
that
his
disability
ceases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lamken,
you
said
one
of
the
th-
things
you
said
is
i-
if
the
fourth
circuit
view
prevailed,
th-
there
would
be
a
large
increase
in
the
number
of
people
who
qualified
for
disability
benefits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
report
of
any
swell
in
the
approved
applications
in
the
fourth
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
that
would
be
the
sixth
month
every
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i-
i-
if
you
started
in
this
in
month
six
let's
take
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
star-
it
starts
six
months
after
he
has
been
disabled
and
it
continues
until
when?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
nine
months.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
case,
when
he
s-
if
he
sta-
he
starts
at
month
six,
how
many
months
actually
would
he
be
getting
disability
benefits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
could
just
give
me
the
the
time
frame.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
end
the
minimum
end
would
be
when?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
some
contider-
-siderable
time
after
he
has
been
restored
to
substantial
gainful
activity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
period
is
over,
making
substantial
gainful
activity,
even
though,
as
you
say,
his
impairment
continued,
he
would
not
be
disabled.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
pryor,
i
think
you
heard
ma-
ms.
pryor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
what
i
asked
mr.
lamken
are
you
saying,
in
effect,
that
the
word
impairment
means
a
disabling
impairment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
ca-
case
i
gave
you
it's
it's
a
a
condition
that
can
be
disabling.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
the
twelve
months,
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
level
of
severity
is,
but
for
the
five
months,
you
must
be
unable
to
engage
in
substantial
gainful
m-
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's...
