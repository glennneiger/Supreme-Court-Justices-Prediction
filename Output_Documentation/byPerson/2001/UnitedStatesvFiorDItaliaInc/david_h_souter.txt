justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
that
error
ever
be
anything
more
than
a
disparity
between
what
the
employee
reported
and
what
the
employer
reported?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
am
i
mean
the
the
error
that
that
section
con-
i'm
wondering
what
the
error
is
that
that
section
contemplates,
and
i
can
i
can
see
it's
application,
let's
say,
if
the
employer
simply
added
up
the
employee's
reports
wrong
and
got
the
wrong
figure.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
question
in
another
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
understand
it
i
mean,
this
is
th-
the
i
didn't
didn't
mean
to
side-track
you
from
justice
o'connor's
question,
but
i'll
i'll
raise
the
thing
that
bothers
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i'll
assume
for
the
sake
of
the
question
that
a
given
employer
has
done
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
also
assume
that
if
you
are
correct,
that
employer
has
this
possibility
hanging
over
it
that
that
that
the
irs
is
is
going
to
make
this
kind
of
an
assessment.
justice
david
h.
souter
m-
my
question
is,
is
there
any
way
that
the
employer
can
anticipate
this
kind
of
an
assessment
in
order
at
least
to
to
avoid
the
interest
running
under
under
this
section?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
they
were
all
correct,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
may
set
up
a
res-
the
employer
may
set
up
a
reserve,
justice
david
h.
souter
but
as
i
understand
it
the
employer
is
not
obligated,
in
in
effect,
to
to
withhold
upon
himself,
is
not
obligated
to
pay
the
tax
on
it
until
the
assessment
comes,
because
under
under
the
irs's
instructions
the
employer
pays
the
tax
on
the
amounts
reported
to
the
employer
even
if
he
knows
they're
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
would...
justice
david
h.
souter
would
he
do
to
anticipate
it?
would
he
would
he
say
i'm
i'm
paying
you
another
ten
thousand
dollars,
i
don't
happen
to
owe
you
that
in
tax
now,
i've
paid
what
the
law
requires
me
to
pay,
and
you
haven't
assessed
anything
else.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
then
how
does
the
taxpayer
take
advantage
of
the
provision
that
allows
him
to
make
a
correction
and
avoid
the
interest
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
will
assume
it's
it's
no
penalty.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
just
want
to
know
how
it
works
in
this
situation.
justice
david
h.
souter
based
on
what
he
has
to
report
to
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
haven't
assessed
anything
yet.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
then
how
does
this
section
have
an
application
here?
you
say,
well,
this
mitigates
it,
justice
david
h.
souter
the
employer
can
do
is
pay
immediately
at
the
moment
of
your
assessment
and
therefore
no
interest...
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
apply
in
these
circumstances.
justice
david
h.
souter
where
would
the
taxpayer
get
the
information?
the
only
thing
the
taxpayer
has
got
are
the
employee's
returns
or
to
the
taxpayer
and
your
assessment.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
taxpayer
going
to
get
the
information
that
would
allow
it
to
do
what
you
say
in
theory
it
could
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
no
please
go...
justice
david
h.
souter
rule
assume
that
the
taxpayer
is,
in
fact,
in
a
position
to
prove
the
correct
figure
if
the
assessment
is
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
comes
back
to
the
question
i've
asked
before.
justice
david
h.
souter
short
of
the
restaurant's
hiring
someone
to
bird
dog
every
single
waiter
and
waitress
to
see
what,
in
fact,
the
tip
was,
i
don't
see
how
the
employer
here
could
collect
the
information.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
in
fact
not
telling
the
cold
truth.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
a
possibility.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
suffice
on
any
rule
of
probability
if
the
government
did
just
what
justice
stevens
described?
it's
quite
true,
yes,
there
might
have
been
an
extraordinary
turnover,
if
there
is,
the
employer
can
come
in
and
say
so.
justice
david
h.
souter
accuracy
of
the
figure,
perhaps,
which
you
said
really
is
not
your
point.
