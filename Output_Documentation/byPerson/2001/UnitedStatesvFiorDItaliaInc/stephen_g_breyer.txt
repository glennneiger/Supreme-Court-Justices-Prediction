and
that's
just
luck,
because
i
thought
justice
o'connor's
original
question
was,
look,
we
can
all
do
this,
it's
so
simple.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
else
that
i-
di-
that
this
restaurant
owner
has
it
in
his
power
to
do?
other
than
write
the
check.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
eight
percent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
about
people
who
satisfy
all
these
other
minimums
it
is
not
about
people
they
can
even
get
a
tax
credit
for
this...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
save
that
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
interested
in
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
in
what
i'd
call
the
mind
run,
mainstream,
basic,
typical
situation,
and
that
is,
what
is
that
answer?
so
far
i'm
concluding
he
can...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
in
typical
cases
like
this
one,
the
restaurant
will
have
paid
more
they
will
have
assumed
that
it
is
more
than
eight
percent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
talking...

an
area
that's
well
above
that,
and
in
respect
to
the
area
well
above
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mhm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
qu-
the
question,
and
to
be
overstate
the
point,
i'm
not
buying
into
this
argument
at
the
moment,
i
but
i
do
want
to
hear
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
is
what's
normal,
and
normal
tip
is
tip,
and
i
don't
understand
the
chickens
and
the
cows
exactly
becau-
i-
in
may
my
copy
of
the
code
here
it
says
it
s-
doesn't
say,
it
says
the
employer,
there
is
imposed
on
the
employer
an
excise
tax
equal
to
six
point
two
percent
of
wages,
and
it
says,
including
tips,
so
i
don't
see
how
what
your
argument
is
that
the
tax
isn't
authorized.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
basic
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
had
the
perfect
evidence,
even
if
there
was
a
memo
beyond
dispute,
written
by
the
accountant
and
and
signed
by
all
the
employers
that
said,
after
the
most
thorough
investigation
of
this
restaurant
i
am
telling
you
privately,
and
you
agree,
that
the
total
tips
earned
that
are
eligible
for
social
security
are
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand,
so
it's
signed
by
fifteen
bishops,
you
know,
absolute,
dead
right,
you're
saying
that
even
if
that's
so,
he
still
doesn't
owe
it
because
in
the
memo
it
doesn't
say
which
employees.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
been
anything
held,
is
there,
that
where
an
employer
clearly
owes
a
tax
to
the
government,
based
because
of
the
earnings
of
the
employee,
and
there
can
be
different
contexts
where
that
comes
up,
the
evidence
that
he
owes
that
has
to
name
or
pick
out
which
employee?
i
assume
if
there
were
a
case
that
ever
said
that
you
would
have
cited
it,
and
i
doubt
that
there
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
isn't,
then
that's
my
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
the
second
case
is
a
tax
case,
it
is
called
united
states
versus
fior
d’italia,
and
it
involves
social
security
taxes,
and
as
most
people
know,
both
employees
and
the
employer
has
to
pay
the
social
security
taxes
on
the
wages
that
the
employees
earn.
in
the
restaurant
world,
those
wages
include
the
tips,
that
is
say
waiters
and
waitresses
and
other
employees,
receive.
now,
this
creates
a
special
problem
because
some
of
them
do
not
report
as
income
all
the
tips
that
they
receive,
though
they
should.
but
the
restaurants
use
sometimes
the
numbers
that
the
employees
report
to
figure
their
own
share
of
the
tax
rather
than
using
the
actual
amount,
and
the
result
is
they
do
not
pay
enough
social
security
tax.
now,
in
this
case,
the
irs
says
that
the
restaurant
called
fior
d’italia
paid
too
little
taxes.
the
irs
figured
out
the
correct
amount
in
its
view
that
fior
d’italia
owes
by
looking
at
all
the
credit
card
slips
in
the
restaurant.
noting
that
the
average
tip
was
about
little
over
14%
and
then
multiplying
the
restaurant’s
total
receipts
by
that
14%.
now,
it
got
a
big
number
and
it
subtracted
from
that
which
was
a
lesser
number,
the
amount
of
tips
that
the
restaurant
had
already
paid
on
and
it
said
you
owe
money
on
the
rest.
now,
that
we
call
the
aggregate
method,
and
the
fior
d’italia
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
the
irs
does
not
have
the
statutory
authority
to
use
that
aggregate
method,
rather
it
said
what
the
irs
has
to
do
is
to
identify
particular
employees
who
paid
too
little
and
calculate
the
restaurant’s
tax
accordingly,
individual
by
individual,
but
we
do
not
agree
with
that.
fior
d’italia
says
we
are
helped
by
a
tax
code
provision
that
says
wages
include
tips
and
the
reason
they
think
they
are
helped
is
that
the
provision
define
tips
as
those
“received
by
an
employee,”
i.e.
note
the
singular
there,
“in
the
course
of
his
employment,”
note
the
singular,
but
we
think
that
argument
makes
too
much
out
of
too
little.
we
basically
reply
by
saying,
well
so
what
if
the
statute
defines
a
plural
term
wages
by
referring
to
tips
received
by
an
employee.
the
code
provision
that
actually
imposes
tax
liability
on
the
restaurant
says
that
the
social
security
tax
is
calculated
as
a
percentage
of
the
wages,
which
is
plural,
of
individuals,
which
is
plural.
so
it
is
on
all
the
wages
put
together,
and
we
also
note
that
any
assessment
has
to
be
reasonable.
fior
d’italia
says
this
is
not
reasonable
because
it
overestimates
our
tax
liability
that
says
some
employees
does
not
owe
tax,
they
earn
too
much
money
during
the
year
and
you
do
not
have
to
pay
tax
above
a
certain
amount.
sometimes
tips
are
in
cash,
and
the
cash-tippers
they
say
are
sort
of
cheapskates.
then
there
are
some
people
who
write
credit
card-tippers;
they
get
credit
cards
and
they
just
put
a
high
amount
in
but
they
make
the
waiter
give
them
back
some
cash,
and
they
have
a
number
of
other
things
like
that.
well,
though
all
that,
we
say
is
so
possibly
but
in
a
particular
case,
the
restaurant
can
go
in
and
introduce
some
evidence
and
if
that
is
all
so,
they
do
not
have
to
be
too
precise
but
if
they
convince
the
judge
that
this
is
a
bad
method
in
a
particular
case,
then
the
judge
can
say,
well
it
is
a
bad
method
in
that
case,
we
won't
use
it.
in
other
words,
what
we
say
is
that
the
restaurant
is
free
to
challenge
the
accuracy
of
the
calculation
in
the
particular
case
but
the
irs
has
the
authority
to
use
the
aggregate
estimate
in
the
first
place.
so,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
which
came
out
differently.
