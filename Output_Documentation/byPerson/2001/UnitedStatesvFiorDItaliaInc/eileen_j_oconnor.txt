ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
about
the
authority
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
to
assess
fica
taxes
that
congress
has
imposed
on
employers.
it
also
involves
the
well
established
principle
of
tax
litigation.
it
involves
two
key
sections
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
how
they
relate
to
each
other,
and
it
involves
the
evidentiary
value
of
assessments
in
tax
litigation.
the
first
of
the
key
sections
is
section
sixty-two
oh
one.
it
appears
at
page
sixty-two
a
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition.
it
authorizes
and
requires
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
make
inquiries,
determinations,
and
assessments
of
all
taxes
imposed
by
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
second
key
section
is
thirty-one
eleven.
it
appears
at
page
fifty-five
a
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition.
this
section
imposes
a
tax
on
employers.
the
tax
is
measured
by
the
wages
they
pay
or
are
deemed
to
have
paid
their
employees.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
section
thirty-one
eleven
at
pa-
page
fifty-five
a
of
our
appendix
to
the
petition...
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
this
is
the
tax
that
imposes
this
is
the
provision
that
imposes
a
tax
on
the
wages
employers
pay
or
are
deemed
to
have
paid
their
employees.
the
question
this
case
presents
is
how
the
commissioner
carries
out
his
obligation
under
sixty-two
oh
one
to
assess
the
tax
that
is
imposed
by
section
thirty-one
eleven.
[inaudible]
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
the
tax
in...
ms.
o'connor...
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
would
what,
your
honor?
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
it
could
also
apply
just
an-
and
sixty-two
oh
five
is
not
specific
to
restaurants
or
food
or
beverage
establishments
or
or
tips
at
all,
because
another
common
error
that
employers
can
sometimes
make
is
mis-characterizing
a
worker
as
an
independent
contractor,
for
example,
and
upon
determining
later
that
the
person
is
actually
an
employee
and
they
should
be
withholding...
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
mhm.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
absolutely.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
right,
those
forms
arrived
absolutely
correct.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
mhm.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
that's
exactly
right,
and
that's
another
indication
of
the
fact
that
congress
realized
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
difficult
provision
for
employers
to
enact.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
well,
one
of
the
things
that
is
somewhat
troublesome
about
some
of
the
briefs
in
front
of
you
from
the
other
side
is
that
the
other
side
is
looking
at
this
as
though
it
were
a
penalty.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
uh-huh.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
right.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
right.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
let
me
point
out
a
couple
of
things
from
your
question,
justice
souter.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
is
in
our
joint
appendix
your
--
oh,
no,
no,
it's
in
the
petition.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
thank
you,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
no,
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that
sixty-two
oh
five
applied
to
this
assessment,
and
in
fact
it
doesn't.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
it
doesn't
need
to,
because
under
thirty-one
twenty-one
q
it's
a
very
interesting
provision.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
reporting
on
a
monthly
basis,
and
in
this
case
there
was
clearly
you
know,
we
have
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
dollars
of
unreported
credit
card
tips
in
each
of
the
two
years
involved
here.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
the
same
method
that
he
would
use
to
make
any
other
determination.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
justice
scalia,
the
burden
is
on
the
taxpayer,
and
in
this
case
the
taxpayer
conceded
the
ent-
the
entire
amount
of
the
adjustment...
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
actually,
n-
not
all
of
that
is
true
is
justice
kennedy.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
oh,
if
in
i-
in
yes,
if
if
there
were
a
dispute
between
the
two
over
any
matter
the
employer
certainly
could.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
just
in
just
as
a
general
proposition.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
that's
what
i
meant,
your
honor.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
well,
actually,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
on
whether
the
individual
employees
were
audited
or
not.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
that's
that's
true,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
i'm
sorry
i
i
didn't...
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
a-
absolutely
your
honor,
and...
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
question.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
restaurant
can
do
is
show
evidence
that
would
tend
to
determine,
or
help
determine
the
amount
of
the
tips,
how
many
wha-
what
kind
of
a
restaurant
you
have,
how
upscale
it
is,
where
it's
located,
the
kind
of
meals
you
serve
in
fact,
the
irs
has
a
procedure
where
restaurants
can
show
all
that
information,
a
sample
menu
to
get
below
the
eight
percent.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
right.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
the
taxpayer
here
had
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
that
has
been
an
assertion
that
is
unproven
in
the
record.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
it
it
may
or
may
not
be
true.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
no,
the
record
doesn't
tell
us.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
district
court,
either.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
magically,
since
its
concession
in
the
district
court,
at
the
appellate
level
and
again
in
its
briefs
before
this
court,
the
respondent
has
come
up
with
all
sorts
of
ideas
that
might
challenge
the
amount
of
the
assessment.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
we
don't
know
whether
the
taxpayer
here
was
paying
the
minimum
wage,
because
none
of
that
was
in
the
record,
because
the
assessment
amount
was
conceded.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
the
social
security
trust
fund,
so
to
speak.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
well,
it
is
a
matter
of
government
accounting.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
a-
as
as
a
matter
of
government
accounting,
there
are
funds
that
that
are...
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
as
as
a
government
funding
matter.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
taxpayer,
it
will
make
a
difference
if
they
use
tips
to
satisfy
their
minimum
wage
requirement,
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
record
we
don't
know.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
it
will
well,
the-
no,
that's
not
entirely
true,
because
it's
an
optional
credit.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
well,
it
is
a
nonrefundable
credit,
and
that
means
that
you
can
either
use
the
credit
as
an
offset
to
your
income
tax,
and
what
you're
suggesting
is
they
don't
have
any
income
tax.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
congress
had
the
opportunity
to
s-
say
that
no,
the
irs
does
not
have
t-
have
the
authority
to
do
what
has
been
referred
to
here
as
aggregate
assessments.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
not
under
the
statute,
justice
rehnqu-
chief
justice
rehnquist,
but
rather
under
the
laws
that
this
court
has
observed.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
it
is
u-
u-
united
states
versus
janis
stands
for
the
proposition
that
an
assessment
is
valid
unless
it
is
without
any
foundation.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
pardon
me?
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
i
think
is
much,
much
lower
than
that.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
this
one
has
a
foundation.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
pushing
it
a
little
far,
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
that's
not
what
this
court
has
held,
i-
particularly
in
united
states
versus
janis,
where
in
fact
the
assessment
there
was
based
on
an
estimate
of
wagering
taxes.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
and
it
is
incumbent
upon
any
taxpayer
upon
whom
a
tax
is
imposed
to
maintain
whatever
books
and
records...
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
well,
i-
the
taxpayer
is
in
a
business
that
requires
a
lot
of
things.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
the
waiter...
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
down
his
tips
in
a
little
book,
and
there
are...
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
that
is...
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
reliable
people
who
they
can
trust
to
follow
the
rules.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
is
the
word
deemed
in
the
statute?
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
i
believe
so.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
fifty-eight
a
thirty-one
twenty
is
where
thirty-one
twenty-one
q
appears,
and
remember
that
is
a
section
that
provides
definitions.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
i
think
you're
right
about
that,
your
honor.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
that
it
did
start
around
nineteen
ninety-two
and
nineteen
ninety-three,
and
the
information
that
the
irs
is
gathering
on
the
forms
eighty
twenty-seven
demonstrated
the
extent
of
the
problem
that
congress
suspected
did
exist
about
substantial
underreporting
of
tip
income.
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
th-
that
is
certainly
the
contention,
and
there
have
been,
however,
no
facts
to
show
whether
that's
that's
true
or
not,
because
in
each
of
the
cases,
not
only
the
ninth
circuit
below,
but
in
each
of
the
other
three
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
decided
by
the
seventh,
eleventh,
and
the
federal
circuits,
no
evidence
was
ever
submitted
to
show
that
the
tips
were
overstated...
ms.
eileen
j.
o'connor
yes,
he
did.
