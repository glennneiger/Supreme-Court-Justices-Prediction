help
if
you
answered
specifically
whether
interest
does
run
on
the
period
between
the
employer
paying
what
the
employee's
reports
call
for
and
the
assessment
at
a
higher
amount.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
case
whatever
may
be
in
the
next
case,
there
is
a
stipulation
in
this
case...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
contesting
the
method.
justice
ruth
bader

power,
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
an
obligation
to
pay
fica
tax,
and
has
an
obligation
to
pay
it
on
the
total
earnings,
and
it's
it
isn't
your
cow
analogy
didn't
just
pass
me
by,
because
the
tax
on
the
employer
is
independent
of
the
tax
on
the
employee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
the
employer's
cow.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
fact,
you
stipulated,
that
you
don't
dispute
the
facts,
the
estimates,
or
determinations
used
by
the
irs
as
a
basis
for
its
calculation
of
an
amount
of
aggregate
unreported
tip
income
by
all
directly
and
indirectly
tipped
employees,
this
is
yours,
this
on
page
thirty-five
of
the
joint
appendix.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
know
that
there
is
a
disparity
between
what's
reported
and
what
is
actually
paid
in
tips.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
proposed,
and
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
this,
at
that
the
government
go
one
by
one
after
the
employees,
and
am
i
correct
in
saying
that
the
same
method
would
be
used
by
the
government
if
it
went
against
an
individual
server,
that
it
you
are
resisting
the
government
using
against
the
restaurant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
specific,
please.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
situations
in
the
tax
law
where
the
government
knows
that
income
has
been
underreported?
aren't
estimates
made
in
many
different
contexts
where
the
taxpayer
doesn't
keep
reliable
records,
and
so
the
government
has
to
f-
find
some
way
of
measuring
what
the
sha-
tax
should
be,
so
it
does
an
estimate?
isn't
that...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
when
i
asked
you,
are
they
making
an
estimate
in
that
case,
and
you
started
to
say
no,
because
the
the
taxpayer,
th-
the
individual
servers
have
all
these...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
an
estimate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
you
are
resisting
when
it's
applied
to
the
employer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
the
irs
are
you
suggesting
they
should
go
after
the
employees,
and
then
when
they
know
the
amount
based
on
the
extra
tax
the
employee
will
have
to
pay,
then
say,
okay,
employer,
you
paid
the
same
amount,
but
practically
can
the
irs,
does
it
have
the
facilities
to
go
audit
every
waiter
and
busboy
and...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
it
isn't
cost-effective
to
go
after
the
individual
employees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
owed
independently,
which
is
what
i
s-
started
to
ask
you
about
when
you
gave
your
cow
example.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
view
of
all
the
questions
about
the
proper
computation,
why
has
the
government
resisted
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
to
come
up
with
a
fair
formula,
because
the
the
contention
is
that
the
government's
formula
exaggerates
the
income,
exaggerates
the
tip
income.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not
em-
employ
that
fair
procedure
of
going
through
the
notice
and
comment,
and
then
i
think
that
was
what
judge
kozinski
said
would
do.
