is
on
the
taxpayer
to
give
information
as
to
which
the
taxpayer
is
not
in
the
best
p-
p-
pos-
position
to
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
is
the
employer
supposed
to
know,
and
you
say,
well,
if
he
doesn't
know
he
can
amend
later.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
he
do
that,
s-
s-
s-
sue
the
em-
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
ought
to
fire
the
employee
and
then
be
subjected
to
a
wrongful
discharge
suit
and
then
subpoena
the
information
so
that
he
can
give
it
to
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
the
capacity
to
do
it
and
the
employer
doesn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
happens
if
the
employer
doesn't
have
enough
gross
or
n-
enough
n-
u-
i
guess,
gross
income
to
offs-
to
offset
the
credit?
then
then
he
has
to
b-
be
stuck
with
the
difference,
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
take
the
position
it
is
presumed
to
be
correct,
don't
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
th-
that's
that's
a
different
argument
from
the
one
that
we've
been
wrestling
with,
which
is
whether
or
not
you
have
within
your
auth-
authority
and
control
an
a
an
ability
to
calculate
the
basis
for
challenging
the
assessment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
began
by
saying,
well,
they
they
differ
and,
g-
frankly,
i
i
don't
give
much
force
to
that
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
get
the
credit
card
receipt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
employer
can
set
up
any
system
the
employer
wants.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
has
the
ability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
the
more
all
the
more
reason
why
the
employer
should
have
a
strong
interest
in
knowing
how
the
division
is
being
made.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
the
gravamen
of
your
of
your
brief
is
that
as
a
principle
an
assessment
shouldn't
be
imposed
on
the
taxpayer
unless
the
taxpayer
has
the
information
to
contradict
the
assessment,
which
certainly
makes
a
lot
of
common
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
kind
of
a
due
process
fairness
thing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
specific
principle
you
can
point
to
to
to
show
the
correctness
of
that
assumption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have
you
have
no
s-
specific
authority
or
precedent
for
the
proposition
that
an
assessment
should
not
be
imposed
on
a
taxpayer
unless
the
taxpayer
is
in
a
good
or
perhaps
best
position
to
contradict
the
assessment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
i
asked
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
cannot
be
imposed
on
the
taxpayer
unless
the
taxpayer
has
the
capacity
or
the
ability
to
contradict
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
everybody
should
know,
but
that
doesn't
usually
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
m-
ms.
o'connor,
at
the
very
outset
you
said
that
three
eleven
imposed
a
tax
on
wages
paid
or
deemed
to
have
been
paid.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'll
f-
i'll
i'll
find
it,
if
you
the...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
i
think
the
deeming
refers
to
the
time
of
payment,
not
to
the
fact
of
payment,
but
i'll
i'll
look
at
that.
