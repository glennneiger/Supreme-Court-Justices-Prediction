we
do
not
know
to
what
extent,
if
any,
those
credit
card
tip
amounts,
or
the
amount
on
the
credit
card
tip
slot
on
a
credit
card,
was
in
fact
received
by
an
employee,
a
tip
received
by
an
employee
that
is
wages
subject
to
the
act.
ms.

the
the
res-
restaurants
handled
it
i-
in
a
in
a
variety
of
different
ways.
ms.
tracy
j.

y-
we
would
know
what
what
each
individual
restaurant
would
know
what
is
done
i-
in
basic
practice
in
their
restaurant,
but
how
much
of
if
any,
of
that
credit
card
amount
was
retained
by
any
individual
employee,
we...
ms.
tracy
j.
power
we
don't
even
know
whether
it's
a
tip.
ms.
tracy

would
know
whether
that
credit

amount
was,
in

a
tip?
no.
ms.
tracy

and
that's
correct,
and
if
i
went
in
and
i
didn't
have
any
cash
in
my
pocket
and
i
said
to
the
waiter,
you
know,
i'm
going
to
leave
some
extra
tip
on
here,
i
need
to
pay
for
the
valet
when
i
leave,
i'm
going

put
five
bucks
extra
on
here,
can
you
give
me
the
cash,
yes,
it's
possible
that
there's...
ms.
tracy
j.
power
of
an
individual...
ms.
tracy
j.

what
their
assessment
stands
for
is
a
is
a
tax
on
my
gross
tip
payroll.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
my
reply
to
that
is,
well
we
started
out
by
saying
it's
wages,
including
the
tips
of
the
employee,
and
they
did
not
give
us
a
bill
for
wages
which
are
the
tips
of
the
employee.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
the
employer
does
not
know
how
the
tips,
the
credit
card
tips
are
distributed.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
at
the
end
of
the
evening
the
employer
would
cash
out
all
the
employees
and
would
turn
over
credit
card
tips
to
employees
who
might
have
received
credit
card
receipts,
and
those
employees
would
then
decide
among
themselves
to
whom
in
what
amount
they
are
going
to
share
those
tips
that
they
have
received,
along
with
any
cash...
ms.
tracy
j.
power
i
don't
really
think
he
can
make
that
a
condition
of
employment.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
well,
i
think
that
there
are
many
employees
who
do
not
want
the
employer
to
have
anything
to
do
to
know
to
do
with
the
tip-sharing
arrangements.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
sorry.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
that's
correct.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
there
is
no
question
that
the
employer
owes
a
fica
tax.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
i
do
not
dispu-
we
did
not
dispute
the
amount
of
the
irs'
aggregate
assessment,
because
of
all
employees
collectively,
because
we
simply
do
not
have
the
information
to
dispute
that.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
there's
plenty
that
the
government
can
do.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
entirely
different,
because,
and
as
the
mcquatters
case
that's
cited
in
the
briefs
by
both
parties
illustrates,
in
that
circumstance,
the
individual
waiter
has
an
opportunity
to
bring
any
defenses
he
has
to
the
government's
assessment
forward,
and
we
are
denied
every
possible...
ms.
tracy
j.
power
the
employee
disputes
the
estimate.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
no
no
tip...
ms.
tracy
j.
power
sorry.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
there
is
a
there's
a
the
situation
where
you
could
have
many
employees.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
it
it
does
reduce
the...
ms.
tracy
j.
power
that
the
employer
would
have
to
owe,
because
if
any
of
that
credit
card
tips
that
you're
assuming
is
in
effect
a
tip...
ms.
tracy
j.
power
received
by
somebody
who
made
less
than
twenty
dollars
a
month,
the
employer
doesn't
owe
any
tax
on...
ms.
tracy
j.
power
no,
because
you
go
back
to
thirty-one
eleven
and
congress
did
not
impose
a
tax
on
i-
on
the
aggregate
earnings
of
all
employees
collectively.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
i
think
that
it
needs
to
say
which
employees
earned
which
amount,
and
that's
what
the
tax
was
imposed
upon,
and
if
on
the
other
hand
you
had
all
of
the
employees
say
yes,
i
earned
this,
yes,
i
earned
this,
yes,
i
earned
this,
then
you
would
have
that
individual...

ms.
tracy

yes,
but
i
believe

opinion
said
that
the

agreed
that
the
excise

a
divisible
tax.
ms.

not
technically,
your
honor.
ms.
tracy

power
i-
it
acknowledged
that
the
agreement
existed,
ms.
tracy

that
time,
because
there
i-
two
documents
at
the
very
end
of
the
joint
appendix
that
a-
are
government
documents,
and
they
indicate
that
the-
that
they
were
not
doing
the
employer-only
assessments
at
that
time.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
doing
them
about
nineteen
ninety-two,
ninety-three
and
you
had
asked
the
question
earlier,
how
many
trac
agreements
are
there
that
have
been
signed.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
and
long
after
the
irs
had
announced
that
they
were
not
doing
aggregate
assessments.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
well,
i
think
that...
ms.
tracy
j.
power
well,
i
think
that
there's
thirty
years
of
congressional
history
that
clearly
shows
that
congress
did
not
intend
for
the
employer
to
be
put
in
this
position,
that
congress
did
not
intend
for
the
employer
to
be
ha-
to
be
required
to
police
and
monitor
the
reporting
of
employees,
and
effectively
that's
what
the
irs's...
ms.
tracy
j.
power
i
think
that
we
have
plenty
of
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
assessment
in
this
case
is
unauthorized
because
it's
on
the
collective
wage-earnings...
ms.
tracy
j.
power
that
i-
that
a
t-
on-
a
tax
cannot
be
imposed...
ms.
tracy
j.
power
i
think
that
the
burden
of
presumption
and
the
burden
of
proof
that
they
have
put
forth
is
premised
upon
the
the
u-
understanding
that
the
person
with
that
burden
has
the
records
and
is
in
the
best
position
to
respond,
and
that
does
not
characterize
this
situation.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
one
of
those
cases
it's
the
the
person
responsible
for
keeping
the
records
is
the
one
taxed.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
excuses
or...
ms.
tracy
j.
power
they
can.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
because
we
are
we
don't
have
the
same
defenses
that
the
waiter
and
the
waitress
does.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
there's
no
requirement
that
they
audit
every
waiter
or
busboy.
ms.
tracy
j.
power
well,
i
don't
think
it's
very
cost-effective
to
do
this
one,
ms.
tracy
j.

because
that's
what
congress
said...
