one
question
that
really
is
puzzles
me
in
this
case?
i
i
can't
follow
the...
justice

but
you
did
have
records,
written
records
that
showed
that
the
actual
amount
of
the
tips
c-
paid
by
credit
card
and
so
forth
to
the
people
in
question
here
was
substantially
larger
than
you
reported.

credit
cards
d-
they
go
to
the
restaurant,
u-
doesn't
the
restaurant
turn
the
cash
over
to
the
employee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
know
what
the
practice
is
in
your
own
restaurants?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
i
understand
the
waiter
may
have
split
the
tips
with
the
busboy
and
so
and
so
on,
but
the
total
amount
of
tip
on
the
credit
card
slip
was
paid
to
some
employee,
was
it...
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
of
that
can
get
you
below
the
amount
that
shows
up
on
the
credit
cards,
because
for
example,
say
that
one
one
employee
got
two
thousand
dollars
in
tips,
and
he
could
have
a
defense
that
i
passed
out
six
hundred
dollars
to
the
busboys,
so
maybe
his
liability
is
less,
but
it
still
seems
to
me
the
employer
would
have
to
at
least
pay
the
a-
aggregate
amount
on
the
credit...
justice
john
paul
stevens
explain
why
a-
assessments
might
be
wrong
as
to
individual
employees,
but
you
still
doesn't
reduce
the
gross
amount
in
the
tip
column
on
the
credit
card.
