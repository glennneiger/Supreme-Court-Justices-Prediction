mr.
david
i.
bruck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
the
second
time
this
year,
the
court
considers
today
south
carolina's
compliance
with
your
decision
in
simmons
v.
south
carolina.
the
issue
this
time
is...
is
the
interpretation,
if
you
will,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
placed
upon
the
future
dangerousness
requirement
of
the
simmons
decision,
specifically
whether,
as
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
put
it,
future
dangerousness
was
neither
a
logical
inference
from
the
evidence
nor
was
it
injected
into
this
case
through
the
state's
closing
argument.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i...
i
think
it
is
true
that...
that
when
a
person
is
convicted
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
an
aggravated,
death-eligible
murder,
it
is...
it
does
not
take
very
much
more
to
put
the
issue
of
future
dangerousness
at
issue.
you
can
conceive
of
crimes...
i
particularly
suggest
the
example
of
an
intrafamilial...
that
is,
the
murder
of
children
by
their
mother
where
the
person
with
no
prior
record
and
no
likelihood
that
the
situation
will
recur,
where
future
dangerousness
simply
does
not
sound
from
the
evidence.
however,
in...
there
are
also--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
i
should
say
that
future
dangerousness
is
not
likely
to
be
at
issue
in...
in
cases
where
state
law
does
not
provide
the
jury
the
freedom
to
consider
it.
if
aggravation
was
clearly
limited
in
a
weighing
statute
in
which
the
jury
has
clearly
said
these
are
the...
or
is
clearly
told,
these
are
the
factors
that
go
on
death
side
of
the
scale
and
nothing
more...
only
you
can
think
of
a
way
in
which
the
prosecution
could
try
a
case
in
a
way
that
clearly
conveyed
the
message
to
the
jury
that--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--you
know,
i
don't
have
an
exact
number.
my
sense
is
that
a
small
minority
have
it
as
a
statutory
aggravating
factor,
such
as
texas,
virginia,
and
oregon,
and
a
much
larger
number
like
georgia,
south
carolina
allow
it
along
with
a
myriad
of
other
sentencing
factors
without
it
ever
needing
to
be
explicitly
mentioned.
these
are
the
so-called
non-weighing
states.
i
would
guess--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes.
i
would
say
where
the
evidence
does
not
sound
in
future
dangerousness
and
where
the
prosecution
does
not
advance
the
jury's
consideration
of
future
dangerousness.
for
example,
in
this
case,
you
know,
on
these
facts,
of
course,
none
of
this
is
implicated.
this
is
simply
simmons.
this
is
within
simmons.
even
if
we
were
to
limit
simmons
to
its
facts,
it
would
include
this
case
because
you
have
an
onslaught
of
future
dangerousness
argument.
you
have
an
onslaught
of
classic
future
dangerousness
evidence
presented--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
for
example,
the
prosecutor
here
took
on
the
issue
of
the
fact
that
this
young
man
was
only
17
years
old,
and
his...
and
had
no
prior
record,
both
very
substantial
mitigating
factors.
and
the
response
was
that
actually
the
very
fact
that
he
had
no
prior
record,
the
prosecutor
said,
makes
him
more
frightening
than
a
serial
killer,
more
frightening
than
a
career
criminal,
which
is
all
future
dangerousness
rhetoric.
frightening
means
looking
toward
the
future.
one
is
not
frightened
by
things
that
have
already
happened,
but
things
that
might
happen
in
the
future.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
in
part.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
he
does.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
i
mean,
we
should
recall
that...
that...
i
mean,
one
can
say,
well,
these
are
just
the
facts
of
the
crime.
the
state
has
enormous
discretion
about
what
evidence
it
wants
to
present,
and
when
it
presents
evidence
that
is
reasonably
likely
or,
in
this
case,
virtually
certain
to
cause
the
jury
to
consider
the...
the
elemental
sentencing
issue
that
a
judge
considers
in
almost
every
case,
will
he
do
it
again,
then--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--it
most
certainly
is.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i
think
there
would
be
no
harm,
although
this
case
provides
absolutely
no
occasion
to
consider
the
issue,
in
dispensing
with
the
future
dangerousness
requirement
for
precisely
that
reason,
that
when...
that
it
is...
there
are
so
few
cases
in
which
the
jury
is
not
likely,
in
the
privacy
of
the
jury
room,
to
ask
the
question,
what
if
he
gets
out
and
does
it
again?
this
comes
up
in
case
after
case.
and
there's
a...
in
weighing
the...
the
state...
i
mean,
is
there
a
danger
that
the
simmons
rule
might
then
be
applied
in
cases
where
it
truly
does
not
rebut
something
that
the
jury...
occasionally
in
the
rare
case,
yes.
but
in
considering
the
equities,
i
think
it's
worth
keeping
in
mind
that
there
is
unfairness
not
only
on
the
issue
of
future
dangerousness
from
this
situation.
there
is
also
unfairness
in
the
retributive
function
that
the
jury
must
suffer,
and
this
is
not
in
this
case.
it
may
be
more
of
an
eighth
amendment
claim,
but
i
think
in
weighing
the
risk
of
unfairness
to
the
two
sides,
it's
worth
keeping
in
mind
that
life
without
parole
is
a
much
more
severe
punishment.
it
is
much
more
retributive
than
is
life
with
parole.
and
it
is...
it
is
more
severe
from
the
moment
it
is
imposed,
not
only
30
or
40
years
hence.
and
the
reason
is
that
life
without
parole
means
life
without
hope.
and
anyone...
i...
i
try
these
cases
and...
and
negotiate
plea
bargains
in
these
cases
at
the
trial
level,
and
i
can
tell
you
that
there
is
nothing
that
cuts
the
ice
faster
with
the
victim's
family,
with
the
prosecutor
in
settling
a
case
than
life
without
parole
not
because
of
the
dangerousness,
but
because
of
its
retributive
effect.
and
there's
something
terribly
unfair
at...
when
everyone
in
the
courtroom
knows
how
crushing
this
penalty
is,
this
penalty
of
life
without
hope,
except
the
jury,
and
they
are
left
to
think
that
their
option
is
to
let
this
man
hope
that
some
day
he'll
be
out
raising
a
family
and
working
at
a
job
and...
and
pretending
to
be
a
respectable
member
of
the
community
when
it
isn't
so.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no,
by
no
means.
this
case...
all
i
am
saying
is
that
if
it
is
true,
as
my
friend
claims,
that
our
category
of
cases
in
these
non-weighing
jurisdictions,
where
the
jury
is
given
free
rein
to
consider
everything,
that
our
category
of
non-dangerousness
cases
is
actually
so
small
as
to
be
nonexistent,
then
in
those
states
at
least
i
think
it
would
be
fair.
and
there
is
no
harm
in
saying--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
that's
right
because
i
represent
a
client
and
all
my
client
requires
is
that
simmons
be
applied.
we
have
something
that
i
think
can
fairly
be
described
as
something
approaching
defiance
of
your...
of
your
decision
in
simmons
when
a
record
like
this
is...
is
found
not
to
raise
future
dangerousness.
the
only
thing
that
state
can
come
up
with
that
they
didn't
do
is
to
call
dr.
grigson,
some
psychiatrist,
to
say--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
for
a
separate
reason,
which
is
it
invites
the...
the
jury
to
treat
the
law
under
which
this
person
is
being
sentenced
as
in
effect
nonexistent.
the
only
thing
that's
real
is
death
because
that
can't
be
changed.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's
true.
but
when...
when
a
court...
i
mean,
a
jury
doesn't
need
to
be
told
that
all
manmade
law
is
subject
to
being
changed
by
man.
that
is
something
that
we
all
know.
jurors
know
that,
that
this
law
was
enacted
by
the
legislature
and
can
be
changed--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--no,
i
would
not
because
to
invite
the
jury
to--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--no.
all
i'm...
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
jury
should
not
be
invited
to
speculate
that
all
the
law
that
it
is
being
told
to
apply
will
melt
away
and
cannot
be
relied
on
and
thus
should
be
ignored.
and
then
the
jury
ceases
really
to
become
a
jury
that
applies
the
law
of
the
state
and
becomes
just
a
pack
of--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--exactly.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's
all
we're
asking.
and,
you
know,
my...
my
submission--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
i
have
to
say
my
case
does
not
turn
on
the
answer
to
that
question.
that
could
be
decided
either
way,
as
this
case
is
reversed,
because
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
it
certainly
would
become
the
stuff
of
future
appeals
to
this
court
from
the
only
two
states
that
see
any
issue
left
here,
pennsylvania
and
south
carolina.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
regardless
of
any
absence
or
presence
or
alleged
absence
of
future
dangerousness.
in
other
words,
every
state
but
south
carolina
and
pennsylvania
already
go
beyond
simmons,
and
these
are
the
only
two
outliers
in
which
the
record
is
combed
for
whether
or
not
future
dangerousness
is
at
issue.
now,
as
i
say--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
yes.
the...
it's
true
that...
that
simmons
set
a
constitutional
minimum
rule
and
it
required
future
dangerousness
to
be
at
issue.
and
there
are
a
great
many...
in
a...
in
a
non-weighing
jurisdiction,
there
are
a
great
many
ways
of
putting
future
dangerousness
at
issue.
it
can
be
done,
as
the
court
has
held
in
simmons
itself,
by
argument.
it
can
be
done,
as
is
never
done
in
south
carolina,
by
instruction
to
the
court,
because
it's
not
a
statutory
factor.
or
it
can...
as
the
state
agrees
and
as
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
acknowledges,
it
can
be
done
solely
by
evidence
without
argument
by
the
solicitor.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
it's...
it's...
there's
very
little
evidence
of
future
dangerousness
and
very
little
argument
that
cannot
also
be
given
a
retributive
interpretation,
which
is
what
the
state
has
labored
to
do
in
their
brief.
and
if
all
that...
it's
striking
that
the
state
is
not
at
all
satisfied
with
the
test
stated
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
which
is
whether
the
issue
was
argued
or
whether
future
dangerousness
is
a
logical
inference
from
the
evidence.
the
state's
test
for
whether
evidence
is...
raises
an
issue
of
future
dangerousness
is
that
the
evidence
must
only
raise
future
dangerousness
and
must
raise
nothing
but
future
dangerousness.
now,
it's
rather
hard.
the
only
example,
as
i
say,
they
can
think
of
is
a
psychiatric
opinion
that
the
man
will
kill
again.
apparently
that's
the
only
evidence
that
triggers
simmons
under
the
attorney
general's
view.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
because
it
ain't
so.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
there
was
no
psychiatric
opinion
introduced
by
the
state
in
simmons
itself.
there
was
nothing
but
a
metaphorical
argument
that
two
members
of
the
court
didn't
think
raised
future
dangerousness
at
all.
but
it
was
this
idea
of
self-defense
in
response
to
someone
who
was
a
threat.
that...
that
was
also
an
argument
about
retribution,
and
as
the
dissenting
opinion
in...
in
simmons
pointed
out,
that...
you
could
certainly
see
the
retributive
meaning,
significance,
that
the
prosecutor
meant
there.
but
it
also...
it
also
raised
the
issue
of
future
dangerousness,
and
that
was
all
in
simmons.
and
that
was
enough.
and
that's
why
i
say
that
to
affirm
this
case
would
require...
would
require
reversing
simmons.
one
has
to
weigh,
too...
i
mean,
you
know,
the
state
argues
this
issue
as
if
we
are
keeping
them
from
introducing
evidence,
and
we
are
doing
something
unfair
or
we're
saying
they
can't
do
this,
they
can't
do
that.
we
don't
say
the
state
can't
do
anything.
all
we
say
is
that
when
they
make
an
argument
like
they
made
in
this
case...
he's
quick-witted,
doesn't
that
make
someone
a
little
more
dangerous,
calling
the
defendant
billy
the
kid,
bloody
billy,
the
butcher
of
batesburg,
and
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
and
on...
that
we
be
able
to
answer
it
by
saying
how
the
legislature
has
defined
life
imprisonment
for
the
people
of
south
carolina.
these
jurors
are
the
same
voters
that
demanded
that
life
imprisonment
be...
be
enacted,
and
now
that
it
has
been
enacted,
what
can
be
fair
about
keeping
the
defendant
from
telling
the
jury,
even
if
all
this
that
the
prosecutor
says
about
me
is
true,
i
will
never
be
released
again?
now,
the...
the
state
also
acknowledges,
both
the
state
supreme
court
and
the
attorney
general,
that
future
dangerousness
was
raised
in
this
case.
they
make
no
bones
about
that.
but
they
say,
well,
we
raised
it
in
a
special
way
that
does
not
implicate
simmons.
what
we
did
was
we
introduced
evidence
that
not
even
the
lexington
county
jail
could
keep
this
man
from
being
nonviolent,
and
that
is
future
dangerousness.
and
that's
why
the
instruction
that
we
offered,
telling
the
jury
that
future
dangerousness
was
not
in
the
case,
was
denied.
but
the...
but
the
state
says,
in
defiance
of
all
common
sense,
that
evidence
that
this
young
man
would
be
dangerous,
even
behind
bars
and
concrete
and
steel,
did
not
implicate
the
notion
that
if
you
notion
that
if
you
let
him
out,
he
would
be
even
more
dangerous.
that
is
why
the
state
says
that
prison
dangerousness
does
not--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
anything
is
possible,
but
that
does
not
commend
itself
to
our
common
sense.
i
think
what
the
jury
is
much
more
likely
to
infer
from
that
is
that
if
even
jail
and
prison
can't
keep
this
guy
from
being
dangerous,
if
he
ever
gets
let
out,
let
out
on
parole,
katie,
bar
the
door.
he's
going
to
be
a
disaster.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that...
as
i
say,
the...
the
evidence
has
two
meanings
and
that
is
one
of
them.
we
don't
quarrel
with
that.
but
at
the
same
time,
if...
if
he
is--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--even
if
it
is
the
most
direct,
how
can
we
say
that
it
does
not
also
prove
that
if
you
let
him
out
on
parole,
he'll
be
even
more
dangerous?
mr.
david
i.
bruck
right.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
i
think
it...
it...
what
we
have
here
is
a
prosecutor
who
has
simmons
and
who
knows
that
if
he
wants
to
hide
from
the
jury...
you
see,
the
prosecution
agrees
with
us
about...
and
this
is,
in
a
way,
what
is
most
disturbing
and
troubling
about
this
case.
if
the
prosecution
did
not
believe,
based
on
their
evidence
and
their
argument,
that
this
jury
was
thinking
about
future
dangerousness
to
society,
why
would
they
care?
what
possible
harm
could
there
be
from
a
simmons
instruction?
i
think
the
prosecution
entirely
agrees
with
us
on
the
importance
of
this
and
on
the
dynamics
of
jury
deliberation
in
a
case
where
a...
where
the...
where
the
state's
evidence
and
the
argument
is
of
this
nature.
they
know
perfectly
well
what
any
practicing
lawyer
who
tries
these
cases
on
either
side
knows,
which
is
that
this
jury
goes
back
in
the
jury
room,
after
having
seen
and
heard
all
of
this,
and
thinks
one
thing
for
sure:
we
got
to
make
sure
he
doesn't
do
it
again.
and
it
is
a
constitutional
fact,
established
by
the
simmons
case,
that's...
that
part
of
that
is
parole,
the
jury's
misconception
about
parole,
because
we've
had
parole
for
so
many
generations
and
life
without
parole
is
a
new
phenomenon
in
this
country.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
right.
for
all
we
know,
the
jury
knew
there
was
parole,
wrongly.
and
no
limitation.
but
i
have
to
say...
and
the
state
has
not
claimed
that
in
the
face
of
this
argument
on
instructions,
that
the
lawyer...
the
defense
attorney
should
have
picked
up
a
statute
book
and
read
to
the
jury
the
instruction
that
the
judge
had
just
refused
to
give.
she
would
have
had
her
head
handed
to
her
on
a
plate
if
she
had
done
that.
that
is
not
permitted
in
south
carolina.
when
a
legal
principle
has
been
ruled
out
of
a
case,
a
lawyer
cannot
then
attempt
to
charge
the
jury
anyway.
and
that
is
not
an
argument
you'll
find
in
the
state's
case.
they
do
say
that
her...
her
rhetorical
claim
or...
or
co-counsel's
claim
that
you'll
never
see
the
light
of
day
should
be
deemed
as
the
equivalent
of
a
no-parole
instruction,
but
you
dealt
with
that
and
disposed
of
that
argument
in
shafer,
where
a
much
more
explicit
argument
was
held
not
to
be
the
equivalent
of
an
instruction
on...
on
state
law
concerning
parole.
so,
i
think
that...
that
argument
has
absolutely
nothing
to
commend
it
and
is...
is
directly
controlled,
i
would
submit,
by...
by
shafer.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
that's
right.
but
you
know,
it...
a
lawyer
doesn't,
under
south
carolina
practice,
need
to
ask
the
court
whether
an
instruction
that
has
been
ruled
out
of
the
case...
whether
it's
okay
for
her
to
read
it
to
the
jury.
we
know
that
that
is
not
permissible.
i
should
add,
too,
that...
that
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury
in
this
case
that
he
is
the
sole
instructor
on
the
facts.
at
page
618
of
the
record,
he
said,
as...
i
am
as
judge
the
sole...
made
the
sole
and
only
instructor
in
the
law.
and
so...
and
that's,
you
know,
how
trials
in
south
carolina
are
conducted.
lawyers
do
not
instruct.
i
realize
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
if
it
were...
if
there
were
a
way
for
defense
counsel
to
have
done
that,
despite
the...
the
court's
ruling,
it
would
have
sufficed
under
simmons,
but
there
was
no
such
way,
and
that's
why
the
state
makes
no
such
argument
in
their...
in
their
brief.
this
is
not
where
an
opportunity
was
passed
up
by
defense
counsel
to
instruct
on
the
law.
this...
there
wasn't
any
such...
any
such
opportunity,
and
that's
why
the...
the
argument
is
so
vague
and
so
unsatisfactory
under...
under
shafer
v....
v.
south
carolina.
if
this
is
enough
to
get
around
simmons
and
to
allow
prosecutors
to
keep
juries
from
knowing
what
the
south
carolina
legislature
has
done
with
respect
to
the
abolition
of
parole,
then
you
will
see,
as
you
already
are
seeing,
case
after
case
from
south
carolina
in
which
the
envelope
is
constantly
being
pushed
further
and
further
back
in
what,
i
have
to
submit,
is
a
somewhat
manipulative
effort
to
get
the
advantage
of
the
jury's
misconceptions,
to
get
the
advantage
of
the
false
dilemma
that
simmons
correctly
identified
in
order
to
get
more
death
sentences
than
are
actually
merited
by
the
law
and
the
evidence
in
each
case.
as
i
say,
this
is
the
second
time
that...
that
south
carolina
has...
south
carolina's
compliance
with
simmons
has
been
before
this
court
in
this
calendar
year.
there
probably
won't
be
another
one
this
calendar
year,
but
there
will
be
a
continuing
procession.
and,
indeed,
the
first
case
in
line
will
be
shafer
v.
south
carolina,
which
was
remanded
for
reconsideration
of
the...
for
consideration...
for
a
ruling
on
the
issue
of
future
dangerousness.
if--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--prospectively,
yes.
it
will...
it
will
do
no
good
for...
for
people
like
shafer
and...
and
the
petitioner
in
this
case
whose
cases
have
already
been
tried.
but,
yes,
the
house
of
representatives
has
already
voted
overwhelmingly
to,
in
effect,
require
a
simmons
instruction
in
every
case.
that
bill
is
now
before
the
senate
and
it
could
be
by
this
time
next
year,
this
will
be
of
only
historical
interest
in
south
carolina,
except
to
the
petitioner--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--the
very
first
time
came
in...
in
1986.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
and
thereafter,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
first
handed
down
a
truth-in-sentencing
rule
and
then
reversed
itself
just
before
simmons,
and
simmons
was
the
first
case
tried
under
the
new
regime.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
question
has
come
up
again
concerning
the
history
of
south
carolina's
handling
of
this
matter.
i
should
say
that
a
very
detailed
accounting
of
the
whole
history,
legislative
and
judicial,
is
provided
in
the
cert
petition
in
simmons
itself,
and
it's
not
a
very
edifying
tale.
it
really
shows
that
the
legislature,
when
they
first
considered
a
limited
life
without
parole,
was
deadlocked
because
of
a
fear
that
it
would
reduce
the
number
of
death
sentences,
and
the
legislative
compromise
that
finally
came
out
was
we
can
go
ahead
and
have
life
without
parole
because
you
don't
have
to
tell
the
jury
anyway.
so,
it
won't
have
any
effect.
and
that
was
the--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
it's
not
entirely
clear.
the
membership
of
the
court
changed,
and
indeed,
the...
the
legislative
leader
of
this
proposal
to
stop
telling
the
jury
or
not
to
tell
the
jury
about
parole
joined
the
court,
and
then
the
membership...
and
then
the
court's
position
changed.
if
there
was
a
connection,
i
don't
know.
but
it...
it...
it's
an
odd
history.
the...
my
friend
says
that,
well,
south
carolina
doesn't
want
the
jury
to
know
about
commutation.
for
a
very
good
reason.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
commutation
of
a
life
sentence
under
south
carolina
law.
we're
one
of
only
two
life
without
parole
jurisdictions
that
do
not
allow
the
governor
to
commute
a
life
without
parole
or
any
prison
sentence.
the
commutation
power
only
extends
to
the
death
penalty.
so,
there
is
a
pardon
power
which--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--clemency.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's
right.
there
is
a
pardon
power
which,
according
to
the
record
in
simmons,
has
never
been
exercised,
and
by
its
terms
requires
a
showing
of
the
most
extraordinary
circumstances.
and
there...
so,
south
carolina's
life
without
parole
is
as
locked
down
as
any
state's.
the
idea
that,
well,
there's
lots
of
play
is
simply
not
so,
and...
and
so
there's
very
little
that
the
state
could
come
back
with.
but
as
a
constitutional
matter,
if
there
was
any
play
at
the
joints,
absolutely,
if
the
jury
is
told
the
truth
that
there's
no
parole,
the
jury
can
also
be
told
the
truth
about
any
possibility
of
release
that
might
exist.
we
don't
deny
that
for
a
moment.
but
the
state
recognizes
that
the...
that
the
real
issue
is
the
unavailability
of
parole,
and
that's
why
they
fight
this
tooth
and
nail.
justice
ginsburg
inquired
about
prior
cases
in
which
the
state
supreme
court
has
reversed
under
simmons.
and
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
there
are
only
two,
and
they
both
involved
cases
that
were
tried
before
simmons
came
down.
and
that
is
why
in
one
case
the
verbatim
same
argument
about
what
to
do
with
him
when
he
is
in
our
midst
was
made
by
the
prosecutor
because
they
didn't
have
simmons
as
the
script
about
what
not
to
say.
but
since
simmons
came
down
and
since
prosecutors
who
are
of
a
mind
to
defeat
the
rule
in
simmons
have
had
the...
the
facts
of
simmons
to
go
by,
not
one
case
by
the
south
carolina...
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
not
reversed
under
simmons
in
a
single
case,
in
every
instance.
now,
it's
true
that
occasionally
trial
judges
have
given
a
life
without
parole
instruction
under
simmons.
oftentimes
it's
because
a
prosecutor,
out
of
a
basic
sense
of
fairness,
does
not
take
the
position
that
the
prosecutor
took
in
this
case.
we're
really
dealing
with
a
due
process
rule
where
you
sort
of
feel
it
in
your
heart
that
there's
something
wrong,
and
that
applies
to
prosecutors
and
judges
too.
but
when
a
prosecutor
decides
to...
to
use
the
simmons
script,
they've
had
very
good
success
in
having
this
instruction
not
given.
and
i
should
say
that
if
this...
if
these
facts
are
now
held
by
this
high
court
to
be
not
to
trigger
the
rule
in
simmons,
you
will
see
that
as
being...
as
being
the
rule.
now,
it's
possible
that
the
legislature
will
step
in.
it's
equally
possible,
after
such
a
large
loophole
in
simmons,
a
loophole
that
will
swallow
the
entire
case,
is
decided
by
this
court--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--thank
you.
