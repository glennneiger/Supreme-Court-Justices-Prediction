justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in...
in
some
sense...
and
this
is
what
concerns
me
about
your
argument...
i...
i
suppose
at
some
level
future
dangerousness
is...
is
always
inferable
from
the
fact
of...
of
a
horrible
crime.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we...
we
are
the
ones
that...
that
gave
you
this...
this
category
of
future
dangerousness.
and
it
either
makes
sense
or
it
doesn't.
if...
if
there's
something
defensible
about
the
category,
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
there
would
be
a
significant
number
of
cases
in
which
it
doesn't
apply.
i...
i
just
don't
see
that
from
your
argument.
now,
maybe
the
category
is
unworkable.
that's
another
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
for
the
reasons
that
we've
indicated
in
our
questions,
i...
i
don't
think
it's
defiance.
i...
i
do
think
the
prosecution
is
being
pretty
careful
not
to
raise
future
dangerous
explicitly
because
it
doesn't
want
the
jury
to
know
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
makes
it
a
little
troublesome--
but
given
the
state
of
our
law,
future
dangerousness
has
to
be
put
in
issue,
and
as
we...
as
we've
indicated,
i...
i
think
under...
under
your
rule
that
would
be
an
issue
in
almost
every
case.
let
me
ask
you
this.
you've
heard
me
ask
it
here
before.
i...
i
take
it
that
if
this
instruction
were
given,
either
the
trial
judge
relented
or
future
dangerousness
was
at
issue,
it's
perfectly
open
to
the
state
to
say,
now...
now,
you
may
think
this
prisoner
has
no
hope,
but
the
legislature
can
change
this
tomorrow
morning.
tomorrow
morning
the
legislature
can
change
the
parole
rule,
and
this
prisoner...
this
defendant
can
be
out
in
the
community,
once
again
a
danger.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
that
would
be
a
fair
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
you
allow
the
prosecutor
to
argue
it
if
you
were
the
trial
judge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
you're
saying
that
the
jury
doesn't
need
to
be
told
what
it
already
knows,
but
that's
inconsistent
with
your
whole
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
you
say
it's
outliers,
but
once
again
that's
the...
that's
the
dichotomy
that
this
court
set
forth
in...
in
simmons
and
in
our
past
opinions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
that
inference.
if
i
were
a
juror
and
i
heard
about
this
evidence,
i'd
say
my
principal
focus
would
be
on
the
safety
of
the
guards
and
the
inmates.
i'd
say
this
man
is
dangerous
in
prison
and
that's
the
reason
for
capital
punishment.
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
logical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you
can't
say
it
defies
all
logic,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the...
the
most
direct
conclusion
that...
that
should
follow
from
the
prosecution's
evidence
on
this
point.
he's
dangerous
in
prison.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this...
this
is
not
a
case,
is
it,
in...
where
the
trial
judge
put
any
limitation
on
the
defense
attorney's
arguing
this
point
or
where
the
jury
came
back
with
a
question.
this
is
not
one
of
those
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understood
justice
ginsburg's
question...
and
i'm
interested
in
it
too...
as
can
you
tell
us,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
are
there
instances
in
where
the
simmons
rule
is
followed
in
south
carolina
and
the
jury
is
instructed
about
parole
because
of
future
dangerous
being
an
issue,
or
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
is
it
the
common
pattern
and
practice
for
prosecution...
for
the
prosecutor
to
stay
away
from
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
would
draw
a
line
depending
in
part
on
how
much
the
issue
was
emphasized
in
the
argument.
not
just
an
isolated
comment,
for
example,
would
not
be
enough.
