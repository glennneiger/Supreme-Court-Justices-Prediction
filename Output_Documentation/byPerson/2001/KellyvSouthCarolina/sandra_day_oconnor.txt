well,
how
many
states
that
use
the
death
penalty
allow
future
dangerousness
as
a
factor
in
sentencing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
is
the
concern,
of
course,
is
if...
whether
this
concept
is
something
that
is
going
to
have
to
be
applied
in
every
capital
sentencing
case
or
whether
there's
some
limitation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it's
hard
to
know
from
your
argument
the
answer
to
that.
can
you
draw
a
line?
