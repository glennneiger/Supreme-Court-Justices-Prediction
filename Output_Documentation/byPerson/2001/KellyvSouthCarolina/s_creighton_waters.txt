mr.
s.
creighton
waters
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
simmons
v.
south
carolina,
a
limited
due
process
exception
was
crafted
to
the
general
rule
in
california
v.
ramos
that
it
was
for
the
states
to
decide
whether
to
inform
the
juries
on
matters
of
parole
or
other
early
release.
and
the
issue
in
this
case
is
what
argument
and
evidentiary
submissions
are
sufficient
to...
for
the
prosecution
to
have
been
deemed
to
raise
future
dangerousness
such
that
due
process
overcomes
that
state
law
rule.
and
petitioner
in
this
case
contends
that
future
dangerousness
can
be
raised
simply
by
the
gruesome
facts
of
the
crime,
by
misbehavior
in
jail,
by
a
prior
criminal
record.
and,
of
course,
that
would
create,
as
has
already
been
discussed,
a
virtually
standardless
test
and
would
conflict
with
this
court's
statements
of
the
simmons
rule,
as
well
as
the
subsequent
interpretation
of
the
rule
by
many
other
courts.
and
that
is,
of
course,
that
a
prosecutor
must
specifically
rely
on
future
dangerousness
to
society
as
a
basis
for
death.
and,
of
course,
that...
the
reason
for
that
is
the
rationale
of
simmons
itself,
which
is
a
due
process
right
of
rebuttal.
future
dangerousness...
a
future
dangerousness
requirement
is
necessary
to
that
due
process
right
of
rebuttal,
and
obviously,
in
order
to
have
the
right
to
rebut
something,
the
other
party
must
have
first
done
something
to
affirmatively
raise
that
issue.
now,
admittedly
some--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--invoke
simmons
itself?
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
well,
i
think,
you
know,
our
state
supreme
court
has
on
two
occasions
ruled
that
simmons
was
violated,
and
in
that
case,
the...
the
prosecutor
argued
that,
you
know,
he's
shown
that
he
cannot
live
inside
or
outside
of
prison.
so,
clearly
that
crosses
the
line.
i
think,
you
know,
the...
the
fundamental--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--well,
in
that
particular
case,
he
said
both
outside
of
society
and
inside
prison
in
that
particular
case.
that's
state
v.
timothy
rogers,
a
state
court
case.
so,
our
court
has
on...
on
a
couple
of
occasions
ruled
that.
i
mean,
obviously--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--i
think
that
by
incorporating
the
outside
society
aspect
of
the
argument,
our
state
supreme
court
has
already
ruled
that
and
i'm
not
here
to...
to
challenge
that.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
no.
there
are
plenty
of
instances
where...
where
solicitors
argue
future
dangerousness
to
society,
and
a
life
without
parole
instruction
is
given.
there...
it...
it
ultimately
boils
down
to
what
the
prosecutor
does
in
his
argument
and
how
the
trial
judge
rules
on...
on
what
was
raised
in...
in
that
trial.
but
it
does
happen.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
i
don't
believe
so
in
this
case.
i
think
if
you
focus
on
the
prosecutor's
argument
as
a
whole,
it's
clear
that
the
majority
of
his
argument
was
retributive.
and
we
would
assert--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--well,
with
regard
to
the
dangerous
comment,
what
the
solicitor
said
in
that
particular
case
was...
he
said,
well,
the
evidence
here
is
that
he's
quick-witted,
he's
not
retarded.
and
of
course,
the
evidence
in
this
case
also
was
that
petitioner
was
a
close
friend
of...
or
the
petitioner's
family
was
a
close
friend
of
this
victim.
he
used
to
work
with
the
victim,
and
that
he
used
that
familiarity
with
the
victim
to
make
her
more
vulnerable.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
that...
that
particular
argument
was...
was
made
at...
at
the
beginning
of
the
sentencing
phase
in
opening
statement.
it
was
a
brief
reference.
i
don't
think
that
that--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--they
did
hear
that,
but
i
think
if
you
read
it
in
context,
it
was
more
of
the
case
of
you
just
committed...
convicted
this
guy
of
a
horrible
crime.
you
have
a
tough
job
ahead
of
you,
and
i
hope
you
never
have
to
do
this
again.
i...
i
think
that...
that
brief,
isolated
passage,
when
read
in
the
context
of
what
the
solicitor
was
saying
there,
would
not
have
such...
been
such
as
to
necessarily
flag
the
future
dangerousness
issue
in
the
mind.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
i'm
not...
i
don't
know
if
i
would
say
that
much.
i
just
point
out
that
it
was
very
early
and
it
was
just
a
brief
reference
in
opening
statement,
and
i
don't
think
that
that...
that
can
be
pointed
to
as
to
have
crossed
that
line
because
i
don't
really
think
he
used
it
for
that
inference,
that
you
know,
this...
you
know,
this
guy
is
going
to
be
dangerous
to
you.
he
was
more
saying,
you
know,
you
just
convicted
this
guy
of
the
most
horrible,
bloodiest
crime
you
can
imagine,
and
he's
a
horrible
person,
and
now
you've
got
one
more
tough
job
to
do.
and
i
hope
you
never
have
to
go
through
this
again.
i
think
that
was
the
point
of
his
argument,
not
that
this
guy--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--well,
he...
he
did
not
say,
i
hope
you
don't
have
to
go
through
that,
but
i
think
if
you
read
his
argument,
that
was
the
point
of
it,
and
i
think
in
context,
that's
the
obvious
point
of
it
rather
than
future
dangerousness.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
in
that...
in
that
particular
case,
the
solicitor
focused
much
of
his
argument
on
that.
he
said,
this...
this
defendant
has
shown
by
his
prior
record,
because
the
defendant
had
had
prior
incarcerations
and
prior
releases...
he's
shown
by
his
prior
record
that
he
cannot
exist
safely
both
inside
prison
and
outside
society.
so,
i
would
concede
that
crosses
the
line.
i
think
it
was
focused
on
in
that
case,
and
it
was
a
direct
statement
of
outside
society.
and
i...
i
don't
want
to
get
into
magic
words,
but
i
think
when
you
say
outside
society,
when
he
clearly
focuses,
that...
that
would
be
a
magic
word
triggering
simmons.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
there's
an
isolated
comment
in
the
context
of
an...
of
an
argument
that
focuses
on
retribution,
that...
it's
kind
of
a
donnelly
v.
dechristoforo
principle,
that
you
shouldn't
assume
that
the
prosecutor
intended
to
worst
meaning
from
that,
and
you
shouldn't
assume
that
the
jury
necessarily
took
the
worst
meaning
from
that.
and...
and
so,
i'm
not
saying...
i'm
just
saying
that
the
context
does
matter,
and...
and
that's
essentially
what
we
have
here.
in
simmons,
you
know,
we
had
a...
the
more
egregious
situation.
we
had
the
prosecutor
say,
jury,
you
know,
the
death
penalty
is
going
to
be
society's
response
to
a
threat,
society's
response.
the
prosecutor
said,
jury,
you
know,
this
will
be
your
act
of
self-defense
to
this
particular
defendant.
the
death
penalty
will
be
an
act
of
self-defense.
the
prosecutor
even
went
on...
so
far
as
to
say
his
own
expert
calls
him
dangerous
and
had
brought
that
out
in
cross
examination.
there's
none
of
that
here.
all
they
can
do
in
this
case
is...
is
go
through
a
technical
parsing
of
the
argument.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
well,
i
think
the
jury
in
this
case...
you
know,
they
are
told
life
imprisonment,
and
they're
never
told
that
there's
any
possibility
of--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--well,
i...
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
necessarily
true.
i
mean,
in
state
v.
patterson,
which
was
a
1986
case
in
south
carolina,
there
was
a
voir
dire
of
the
jury
on
that,
and
most
of
the
jurors
said,
we
thought
it
meant,
you
know,
he'll
never
get
out.
so,
i
mean,
there's
conflicting
evidence
on
that.
i
know
this
court
has
repeatedly
referred
to
the
fact
that
it...
it
is
new
event
and
many
jurors
may
not
know,
but
i
don't
know
if
that's
necessarily
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fundamental
fairness,
we're
still
talking
about,
to
some
degree,
deference
to
the
states.
and...
and
so--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--well,
i
think
that
the...
the
ineligibility
of
parole,
as
this
court
held
in
simmons,
is
only
directly
relevant
to
future
dangerousness
to
society
argument,
and
that,
of
course,
was
the
due
process
rationale
followed
in
simmons.
as
far
as
whether
under
an
eighth
amendment
context
or
even
under
a
due
process
that
life
without
parole
is
an
effective
rebuttal
to
retribution
arguments
and
that
sort
of
thing,
that's
not
presented
by
this
case.
but
i...
i
think
that
the...
the
relevance,
again,
of...
of
ineligibility
for
parole
is
to
rebut
future
dangerousness
to
society.
that's
what--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--yes.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
well,
again,
the
jury
is
told
we're
dealing
with
death
or
life
imprisonment.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
i
think
that
that
depends
that...
that
be
all
to
end
all
is
the
without
parole
context
of
life.
i
mean,
life
is
still
a
very
severe
penalty,
and...
and
in
order
to
get
to
your
point,
i
think
that
you
have
to
assume
that
adding
without
parole
to
it
makes
it
so
far--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--well,
again,
i
would
have
to
fall
back
to
the
fact
of
is
the
only
aspect
of
the
state's
case
that
it
rebuts
is
future
dangerousness
to
society.
and...
and
so
that--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--because
if
it
is
a
purely
retributive
case
and...
and
future
dangerousness
was
not
an
issue,
then
there
is
nothing
fundamentally
unfair.
the
state
has
not
made
any
arguments
that
the
defendant
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
rebut.
and...
and
that's
the
holding
of
simmons.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
i
don't
know
if
you
can
necessarily
assume
that's
the
case
when
the
jury
hears
evidence
and
they're
instructed
on
what
to
consider
and
the
focus
of
the
evidence
is
his
adaptability
in
prison,
which
is
the
case
in
this
case
and
many
other
cases.
and
i
think
with
regard
to
life
without
parole
being
a
response
to
purely
retributive
arguments,
it's
not
such
an
obvious
be
all
and
end
all
response
to...
to
retribution
that
due
process
steps
in,
as
opposed
to
the
situation
in
simmons
where
future
dangerousness
to
society
does
respond
to
that.
i
think
that
there
is
still
a
distinction
there
that...
that
retribution
is
not
necessarily
directly
responded
to
by
a
life
without
parole
sentence,
and
so--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--there...
there
are
a
number
of...
of
jurisdictions
that
have
wrestled
with
that.
i
think
california
v.
ramos
is
an
example
of
that.
illinois
has
had...
has
wrestled
with
that.
so,
some
do
allow
charges
on
the
possibility
of
commutation,
on
the
possibility
of
pardon,
on
the
possibility
of
change
in
the
law
and...
and
add
argument
on
that
as
well.
and,
of
course,
south
carolina's
policy
has
always
been
that
we
want
a
simple
either/or
choice,
death
or
life,
and...
and
we
don't
want
to
bring
in
these
collateral
concerns.
now,
whether
the
members
of
this
court
disagree
with
that
as
a
matter
of
policy,
this
court,
of
course,
has
stated
in
many
contexts
that,
you
know,
the...
the
wisdom
of
policy
decisions,
as
long
as
they
have
a
certain
modicum
of...
of
reasonableness,
are
for
the
states.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
no,
no.
parole
and
early
release
is
off-limits
on
both
sides
of
the
coin,
and
there's
never
been
a
state
case
yet
to
rule
that,
well,
to
be
fair,
the
prosecution
needs
to
have
that,
at
least
as--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--absolutely,
absolutely,
and
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
or
it
could
be
changed.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
not
of
which
i'm
aware.
in
fact,
this
rule
developed
initially
when
there
was
parole
eligibility,
and
it
was
really
a
rule
initially
created
to...
to
benefit
defendants,
frankly,
in...
in
that
they
didn't
want
the
jury
to
know...
the
defense
didn't
want
the
jury
to
know
that
there
was
parole
eligibility.
so,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
said,
okay,
we're
going
to
charge
life.
life
means
life
imprisonment.
that's
what
it
means.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
it
had.
there
was
a
period
of
time
where
their...
they
did
sanction
charging
on
parole
eligibility.
this
was
prior
to
life
without
parole
on...
on
either
20
or
30-year
parole
eligibility,
depending
on
the
jury's
finding
of
aggravators.
that
existed,
i
believe,
for
about
4
years,
and
was
overturned
in
1991
i
think.
so,
there
was
a
period
of
time.
but
the
policy...
the
rule
has
always
stayed
the
same,
though,
and
that
is
that
we
don't
want
the
jury
to
be
legislating
a
plan
of
punishment.
we
don't
want
to
be...
them
to
be
concerned
about
these
possible
future
events.
we
want
them
to
make
an
either/or
choice.
and
south
carolina
will
remain
true
to
simmons,
but
beyond
that,
unless
the
policy
is
considered
to
be
so
unreasonable
as
to
not
pass
the
laugh
test,
then
i
think
that
they
can
potentially...
they
can
have
that
policy.
and
i
want
to
bring
up
another
point,
especially
with
regard
to
this
and...
and
what
the
prosecution
did
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
the...
the
court
should...
or
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it
would
be
wise
to...
to
assume
that
prosecutors
are
going
to
be
dishonest
or
to
assume
that
the
state
court
is
going
to
be
dishonest
and
is
going
to
circumvent
this
rule.
and
in
fact,
what
the
prosecution
was
doing
in
this
case,
yes,
he
was
trying
to
avoid
simmons,
but
he
was
doing
that
to
obey
the
law.
and...
and
clearly
in...
in
justice
o'connor's
concurrence,
it
said
that
if
the
prosecution
does
not
argue
future
dangerousness,
then
the
charge
does
not
have
to
be
given,
and...
and
that's
what
the
prosecutor
was
doing
here.
so,
he
wasn't
trying
to
circumvent
the
law.
he
wasn't
trying
to
be
sneaky.
he
was
trying
to
obey
the
law,
and...
and--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--that's
true.
that's
true.
he
made
a
tactical
decision
that
he...
and
i
don't
know
if
it's
necessarily
tactical...
he
was
not
going
to
rely
on
future
dangerousness,
and
since
that
would
not
trigger
simmons,
then
the
state
law
rule
would
apply.
and
that's--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--well,
i'd...
i'd
like
to...
to
address
that
specifically.
at
that
point
in
the
argument,
he
was
talking
about
the
particular
crime
in
this--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--no,
not
at
all.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
what
he...
what
he
was
doing
was
he
said,
okay,
this
defendant
is
quick-witted.
this
defendant...
the
evidence
says
this
defendant
is
not
retarded.
now,
doesn't
that
make
him
more
dangerous
for
shirley
shealy,
for
this
crime
on
this
january
the
5th,
for
this
particular
lady?
and
what
he
was
saying,
if...
if
you
read
his
argument
in
context,
was
again
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
a
close
family
friend
of
the
victim
and
also
used
to
work
at
that
very
same
kentucky
fried
chicken.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
well,
i
don't
know
if
you
can
necessarily
read
that
that
was
at
a
protracted
period.
it
may
have
been
he
just
cut
off
before
he
finished
his
sentence.
but
what
he
was
trying
to
say
was
is
that
he
was
more
dangerous
for
her
because
she
would
have
trusted
him.
she
would
not
have
expect
to
be
cut
to
ribbons
by
this
person
because
he
was
her
friend.
and
that's
what
the
prosecution
was
saying.
he
was
saying
that
makes
this
crime
more
aggravated.
it's
more
premeditated.
it's
more
callous.
he
preyed
on
the
vulnerability
of
the
victim.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
she
was
outside
prison,
but
this
is
retribution.
this
is,
you
know,
jury,
sentence
this
defendant
to
death
for
all
the
bad
things
that
he
has
done
culminating
in
this
capital
crime.
this
was
such
a
horrible
crime.
and
if
you
read
the
prosecution,
there's
at
least
five
or
six
examples
where
he
says,
what's
the
punishment
that
fits
the
crime?
it
doesn't
matter
if
he
doesn't
have
a
prior
record.
this
case
is
bad
enough
on
its
own.
this
is
a
case
for
the
death
penalty.
and
that
was
a
recurrent
theme
from
the
beginning,
the
middle,
and
the
end
of
his
argument,
from
start
to
finish.
so,
i
would
assert
then
that,
you
know,
when
read
as
a
whole...
and...
and
again,
if
you
look
at
the
evidence
of
dangerousness...
and
there's
been
some
raised
of
whether...
the
issue
raised
of
whether
dangerousness
within
prison
counts.
and
obviously,
as
a
matter
of
logic,
it
doesn't
because,
you
know,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
going
to
get
out
of
prison
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
he
will
be
a
danger
inside.
but
more...
more--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--i...
i
don't
think
the
link
is...
is
so
readily
made.
i
mean,
it's
common
knowledge
that...
that
prison--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--well,
in
that
particular
instance,
number
one,
the
prosecution
never
used
any
of
that
in
his
closing
argument.
but
i
don't--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--absolutely.
but...
but
number
two,
if
you...
that
there
was
their
adaptability
expert,
and
all
of
this
went
to
focus
on
what
the
jury
had
before
it,
which
was
adaptability
to
prison,
and
that's
the
issue
that
they
were
focused
upon.
and...
and
what...
and
the
expert
said,
well,
you
know--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--i
think
that
that...
that
evidence
is
very
close,
but
i
would...
i
would
assert
that...
that
the
way
it
was
used
in
this
particular
case
to
respond
to
adaptability,
which
is
dangerousness
within
prison,
which
was
the
specific
issue
that
was
focused
before
this
jury.
if
the
prosecution--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--no.
i...
i
agree
that
that
particular...
those
particular
instances
are
a
bit
broader
than
the
majority
of
evidence
of
dangerousness
within
prison,
but
i
think
that
the...
his
expert
said,
look,
he's
not
a
violent
person.
he
hasn't
had
a
violent
past.
he...
he's...
he's
not
mentally
ill.
he's...
he's
going
to
be
great
in
prison.
he's
not
the
type
of
individual
that
poses
a
risk
in
prison.
he's
not
a
predatorial,
institutional
violent
individual,
which
their
witnesses
were
noting
a
distinction
between
society
in
prison
and
society
outside
of
prison.
and
i
think
all
the
state
was
doing
was
cross
examining
on
that,
saying,
wait
a
minute.
you're
saying
he's
going
to
be
adaptable?
well,
he
says,
you
know,
he
has
violent
fantasies.
well,
that
was
brought
out
on
direct
by
the
defense.
they...
they
brought
that
out,
of
these
violent
fantasies,
and
the
state
was
merely
cross
examining
on
a
point
that
already
had
been
made
by
the
defense
and
saying,
your
opinion
here
is
that
he's
adaptable.
well,
what
about
this...
this
violent
fantasy?
so,
it
was
only
used
in
the
context
of...
even
though
it...
i
agree,
it
has
a
broader
context...
a
broader...
you
know,
it
wasn't
just
his
misbehavior
in
prison,
but
it
was
only
used
by
the
state
here
to
challenge
the
adaptability
prison
in...
or
the
adaptability
issue
of...
of
what
he
would
do
in...
within
prison.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
oh,
absolutely.
this
is
the--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--absolutely.
and
this
is...
this,
of
course,
is
the
state
of...
of
skipper,
and...
and
it's
an
inevitability
that...
that
you're
going
to
see
an
adaptability
case.
but--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--i'm
sorry?
the...
the
point?
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
correct.
as
a
matter
of
logic
that--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--and--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--and
i
think
that
that's...
i
would
agree
with
that
wholeheartedly.
i
think
the
majority
of
the...
of
the
prosecution's
dangerousness
within
prison
evidence
went
to
him
being
an
escape
risk,
and...
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
is
whether
or
not
you
buy
there's
a
distinction
between...
or
accept
there's
a
distinction
between
inside
prison
and
outside
society,
whether
or
not...
whatever
you
think
about
simmons,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
ineligibility
for
parole
does
absolutely
nothing
to
respond
to
the
fact
that
he's
an
escape
risk.
he's
saying
he's
going
to
bust
out.
it...
the
fact
that
he
can't
get
parole
does
nothing
to
respond
that
he's
going
to
bust
out...
that
he
might
bust
out
of
prison.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
i'm
sorry?
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
with
the?
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
what?
the--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--no.
that's...
that's
not
necessarily
my
argument.
i
think
the
argument,
again,
goes
to
adaptability.
i
certainly...
certainly
wouldn't...
wouldn't
assert
that.
but,
you
know,
as
far
as
to
his
contention
that,
well,
why
does
the
state
care,
you
know,
about
giving
this
charge
if
they're
saying
they're
not
raising
future
dangerousness,
again
it
raises
these
collateral
concerns
down
the
road
of
pardon,
which
he's
eligible
for
pardon.
it
raises
the...
the
issues
of
change
in
the
law,
and...
and
the
state
seeks
to
avoid
those.
and
so,
that's
why
it
cares.
it
doesn't
want
to
have
to
get
into
that.
and
if
that
issue
is
given,
i
don't
know
if
a
trial
judge,
without
direction
from
the
supreme
court,
the
state
supreme
court,
would
allow
a
prosecutor
to
then
respond
with...
with,
you
know,
arguments
about
change
in
the
law.
and...
and
i
guess,
you
know,
depending
on...
on
what
happens,
we'll
have
to
see
guidance
on
that.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
right.
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
i...
i
fully
understand
what
shafer
held,
and
my
only
point
with
that
was,
was
that
the
reasons
that...
that
this
court
relied
upon
in
shafer
were
not
present
in
this
case,
to
why
those
were
not
sufficient,
and
that
was,
number
one,
the
jury
asked.
so,
obviously,
it
didn't
work.
and
number
two,
that
the
judge
told
the
jury,
well,
parole
eligibility
is
not
for
your
consideration,
which
raised
the
concern
in
simmons
that,
well,
parole
is
available
but
for
some--
mr.
s.
creighton
waters
--i
think
it's
very
unlikely
the
trial
judge
would
have
allowed
her
to
do
that.
absolutely.
and...
and
we
would
just
assert,
though,
that...
that
this
is
a
case...
there's
no
indication
whatsoever
that
the
jury
was
confused
or
concerned
with
his
possible
release.
they
didn't
ask
the
question.
they
weren't...
it
wasn't
interjected
by
the
trial
judge.
and
so,
all
i'm
saying
is...
is
that
makes
this
case
materially
different
from
what
happened
in
shafer
when
it
said
that
that
was
insufficient.
and
this...
this
lawyer
argued
natural
life
in
prison...
imprisonment
extensively,
said,
you
have
two
choices,
jury.
you
have
death,
a
quick,
painless
death,
or
you
have
a
long,
slow
death,
and
that
a
wife...
and
he
asserted
earlier,
that
well,
you
know,
the...
but
the
jury
might
think
he's
going
to
get
out
of
prison
and
have
a
wife
and
a
car.
well,
no.
the
defense
argued
in
this
case
just
the
opposite.
they...
they
argued
that
a
wife
is
never
ever
going
to
happen
for
billy
kelly.
a
car
is
never
ever
going
to
happen
for
billy
kelly,
and...
and
concluded
by
saying,
i
think
life
imprisonment
is
the
right
punishment
in
this
case
because
he'll
never
see
the
daylight...
the
light
of
daylight
again.
so,
i
think
it
was
clearly
made
to
the
jury,
and
there's
no
indication
that
there
was
confused...
they
were
confused.
there's
no
indication
of
a
fundamental
unfairness
in
this
case.
finally,
i
think
again
this
court
has
stated
in...
thank
you
very
much.
