mr.
bruck.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
the
question
you
presented
in
your
petition.
all
you
presented
in
your
petition
was,
was
the
ruling
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
in
this
case
contrary
to
simmons?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but...
but
the
certainty
that
life
without
parole
will
confine
him
indefinitely
is
much
less
than
that
execution
will
kill
him.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
just
didn't
like
being
confined.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
he
just
didn't
like
being
confined.
i
mean,
you
can
imagine
a
situation
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bruck.
mr.
waters,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
itself
changed
its
rule
on
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
passage
are
we...
are
we
talking
about
a
passage?
i
don't
have
it
in
my...
where
the...
the
prosecutor
expressly
says
future
dangerous?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
perhaps
from
his
question
that's
what
we
were
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waters.
mr.
bruck,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina,
i
gather
from
your
opponent,
shifted
its
position
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
was
the
reason
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
commutation,
that's
all
synonymous
with--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--clemency?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bruck.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
00-9280
kelly
against
south
carolina
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
