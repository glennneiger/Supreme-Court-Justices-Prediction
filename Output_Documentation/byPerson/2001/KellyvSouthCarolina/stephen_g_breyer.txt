justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
all
the
other
states,
in...
in
every
other
state
that
has
capital
punishment--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--this
instruction
is
given
as
a
matter
of
course?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
shouldn't...
why
shouldn't
it
be?
why
isn't
it
fundamentally
unfair
in
every
capital
case,
after
all,
not
to
give
the
instruction
that
the
alternative
is
life
without
parole?
after
all,
you
have
a
jury
who
knows
it
has
a
murderer
in
front
of
it.
it's
trying
to
decide
among
all
alternative
punishments.
death
is
the
worst,
and
then
the
state
won't
tell
them
what
the
alternative
is.
apparently
every
state
but
two
have
decided
that
is
unfair.
and
why,
to
go
back
to
basics,
isn't
it
as
unfair
a
thing
just
about
as
one
can
imagine
to
tell
the
jury
you
have
to
give
life
or
something
else
and
then
not
tell
them
what
the
something
else
is,
particularly
when
they're
likely
to
think
he'll
be
out
after
a
few
years?
justice
stephen
g.

but
sitting...
in
your
experience,
wouldn't
you
say
most
jurors
are
sitting
there
thinking
that
life
doesn't
mean
life?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
the...
the
argument
to
the
contrary
would
be
if
you
were
sitting
there
thinking
that
this
terrible
murderer
is
in
front
of
you
and
you
are
asked
what
is
the
appropriate
punishment,
and
on
the
one
hand
you
were
told
it's
death,
and
on
the
other
hand
you
were
told...
well,
you're
not
told
because
a
person
who
wants
to
retribute,
wants
vengeance,
would
surely
like
to
know
that
the
alternative
to
death,
which
is
surely
vengeance,
is
life
in
prison
forever,
not
just
life
in
prison
for
10
or
15
years.
i
mean,
can
you
think...
in
a
death
case
punishment
stage,
surely
that
would
be
on
anyone's
list
of
top
five
of
the
relevant
factors.
