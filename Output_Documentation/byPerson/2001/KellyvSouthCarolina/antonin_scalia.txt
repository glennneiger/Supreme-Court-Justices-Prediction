wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
you
say
evidence
sounds
in
future
dangerousness.
what...
what
evidence
that...
that
is
introduced
at...
you
know,
at
the...
at
the
sentencing
phase
that
this
is
a
horrible
person
would...
would
not
sound
in
future
dangerousness?
you're
trying
to
show
that
this
is
a
horrible
person,
that
he
deserves
the
death
penalty.
what
kind
of
evidence
wouldn't
sound
in
future
dangerousness?
justice
antonin
scalia
now...
now,
you're
relying
on
the
statement
of...
of
the
prosecutor--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
his
use
of
the
word
frightening.
and
in
another
place,
he
does
use
the
term
dangerousness.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
that's
one
thing
if
you
want
to...
and...
and
we...
we
can
discuss
that.
but...
but
i'm
more
concerned
about
your
broader
point
that
when
the
evidence,
as
you
put
it,
sounds...
i'm
not
sure
it's
the
proper
use
of
sounds,
but
when
the
evidence,
as
you
put
it,
sounds
in
future
dangerousness,
we
have
to...
it...
it
is
constitutionally
required
that
you...
you
have
the
instruction
about
no
parole.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
will
always
be
the
case.
you...
you
are
asking
for
a
rule
that...
that
will
cover
every
capital
case.
i
cannot
imagine
a
capital
case
where...
where
the
prosecution
does
not,
at
the
sentencing
phase,
put
in
evidence
that
makes
this
look
like
a
horrible
person,
hence,
a
dangerous
person.
and...
and
i...
you
know,
i
just
don't
know
that
we're
prepared
to
go
that
far.
which
leads
me
to
what
words...
what
are
the
magic
words
that
you
want
the
prosecution
not
to
be
able
to
use.
frightening
is
one
magic
word.
right?
dangerous
is
another
magic
word.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i
mean,
we
can
just
have
a
list
of
magic
words
that
prosecutors
shouldn't
use
from
now
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
asking
us
to
overrule
simmons.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
whether...
whether
we
should
allow
that
to
happen
depends
on,
you
know,
how
fair
it
is
to
the
prosecution
and
why
shouldn't
the
prosecution
be
able
to
point
out
the
reality
that
that's
what
the
legislature
has
said
today
and
it
can
change
that
tomorrow?
so,
if
you
really
want
future
dangerousness
to
be...
to
be
treated
openly
and
honestly,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
just...
just
say
put
in
the
one
side
and
not
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what?
what's
so...
what's
so
absurd
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
so
absurd
about
that?
if
simmons
meant
anything,
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
simmons
meant,
or
otherwise
it...
it...
you
know,
it's
virtually
worthless.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
isn't
what
simmons
said.
i
thought
the
rule
of
simmons
was...
was
a
rule
of
fairness.
look,
prosecution,
if
you're
going
to
argue
that
this
man
should
be
executed
because
it...
he
will
be
dangerous
to
society
if
he's...
if
he's
let
out,
then,
for
pete's
sake,
you
have
to
let
the
jury
know
that
he
won't
be
let
out.
it's
an
unfair
argument
for
the
prosecution
to
say
he'll
be
dangerous
to
society
unless
you
execute
him,
when
the
prosecution
knows
that
he'll
never
get
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is
far
beyond
that.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
such
an
unfair
argument
by
the
prosecution.
he's
not
saying
don't
let
this
person
go
because
he'll
be
praying
on
society.
there's...
there's
nothing
approaching
that
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
the
reason
for
these
rules
were
just...
just
state
principles
that
the
law
says
what
it
says,
and
we
don't
want
to
get
into
the
refinements
of...
of
how
long
a
life
sentence
may
be.
in
those
states
that
do
allow
the
fact
that
a
life
sentence
does
mean
a
life
sentence
to
be
introduced,
do
those
jurisdictions
also
permit
or
do
other
jurisdictions
permit
the
prosecution
to
show
that
a
life
sentence
does
not
mean
a
life
sentence?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
prosecution
allowed
to
argue
in
south
carolina
when...
when
the
choice
is...
is
life
or
death,
is
the
prosecution
allowed
to
argue
the
possibility
of
commutation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
really
very
fair,
is
it?
when...
when
the
jury,
you
know...
if
you
instruct
the
jury
that
life
means
life,
it
really
doesn't
mean
life.
you'd
have
to
let
the
prosecution
come
in
and
say
it
could
be
commuted.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
the...
all
the
law
can
be
changed?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
is
important
to
the
state,
i
suppose,
to
show
that
he
will
be
dangerous
in
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
jury
presumably
would
not
want
to
give
a
life
sentence
to
someone
who's
going
to
continue
to
kill
in
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
argument
is
made
whenever
the
state
makes
that
point,
that
perfectly
valid
point,
to
the
jury.
it
automatically
triggers
simmons.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
argument
made
is
that
when
the
state
makes
that
perfectly
valid
point
about
dangerousness
in
prison,
it
automatically
triggers
simmons.
and
you
say
it
should
not
unless...
unless
the
prosecutor
specifically
argues
violence,
dangerousness
outside
of
prison.
