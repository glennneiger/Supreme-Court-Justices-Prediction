justice
david
h.
souter
don't
you
have
that
here?
i
mean,
the
argument
here
was
not
only
the...
the
bloody
billy,
the
butcher
of
whatever
it
was,
but
the
words
dangerous
were
used
i
think...
i
think
twice
to
describe
him
in
the
argument,
once
at
least.
and...
and
the
argument
included
the...
the
statement
to
the
jurors,
i
hope
you
never
have
to
be
in
the
position
again
of
being
30...
30
feet
away
from
this
kind
of...
of
a
killer.
well,
the
jurors
aren't
going
to
be
spending
time
in
prison,
and
i...
i
don't
know
why
that
argument
means
anything
other
than
i
hope
this
guy
is
not
going
to
be
out
where
you
are
going
to
be
and
find
you
as
close
to
him
again.
so,
hasn't...
hasn't
he
raised
it
even
on...
on
your
criteria?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not
talking
about...
i
mean,
you...
the
majority
of
the
argument
isn't
even
the
criterion
that
you
are
arguing
for.
you
said,
look,
he's
got
to
raise
it
on
my
theory.
he's
got
to
raise
it
as
an
argument
that
this
person
will
be
dangerous
on
the
outside.
and
i
assume
if
he
does
that
once,
that's
sufficient
on
your
theory.
and
my
question
is,
didn't...
even
on
your
theory,
didn't
he
do
it
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what...
what
about
the
30
feet?
i
hope
you're
never
in
this
position
again.
what
about
that
argument?
i
mean,
isn't
that
an
argument
that
makes
no
sense
except
on
the
assumption
that
this
person
might...
the
defendant
might
be
outside?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
it
was
made
to
the
jurors.
they
heard
it,
didn't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
if...
if
the
prosecutor
had
closed
his
argument
with
that,
that
would
have
sufficed.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
didn't...
my...
my...
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
because
i
don't
have
the
transcript
in
front
of
me,
but
my
recollection
is
he
didn't
say,
i
hope
you
don't
have
to
go
through
this
again.
he
said,
i
hope
you're...
you
know,
you're
not
in
this
position
of
being
30
feet
away
from
this
kind
of
a
person
again,
which
is
i
think
quite
different.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
does
deference
to
the
state
got
to
do
with
fundamental
fairness?
it
seems
to
me
that's
an
entirely
different
argument.
the
fundamental
fairness
question
that
justice
breyer
is
raising
is
in
a
context
in
which
it
may
or
may
not
be
debated
as
to
whether
jurors
know
instinctively
that
life
really
means
life,
doesn't
fundamental
fairness
require
that
they
be
instructed
unequivocally
so
that
they
know
the
terms
within
which
they
must
act
in
coming
to
a
verdict.
that's
the
fundamental
fairness
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in...
in
simmons,
there's
no
question
that
the
future
dangerousness
issue,
together
with
the
jury's
question
and
so
on,
presented
an
egregious
case
of...
of
a
need
for
instruction.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
let's...
let's
assume...
and
i
don't
believe
this
is
this
case,
even
remotely,
but
let's
assume
we
had
a
case
in
which
somehow
future
dangerousness
were
not
an
issue.
and
let's
assume
we...
we
had
a...
a
straight
retribution
case.
given
the
fact
that
there
is
enough
history
to
put
in...
in
doubt,
to
put
into
question
what
really
is
meant
by
life
imprisonment,
in
the
absence
of
a
further
instruction,
why
doesn't
fundamental
fairness
require
that
the
jury
know
for
sure
what
the
terms
mean,
which
it
must
select
from
in
sentencing
this
person?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that
simply
begs
the
question.
that...
that
is
changing
my
question
to
you.
my
question
to
you
says
we're
operating
in
a
context
in
which
historical
practice
leads
one
to...
to
question
whether
jurors
really
do
understand
that
life
means
life
in
this
case
in
this
state
now.
on
that
assumption,
why
doesn't
fundamental
fairness
require
that
the
juries
be
given
a
clear
instruction
so
that
they're
not
sitting
there
wondering
what
it
means
if
they
come
back
with
a
life
sentence?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
bet
i
assume
that.
there
is
a
big
difference
between
life
imprisonment,
in
which
a
person
never
walks
out
of
the
prison,
and
life
imprisonment
in
which
the
person
walks
out
15
years
later.
yes,
i
make
that
assumption
and
i
want
you
to
make
that
assumption
in
answering
my
question.
why
doesn't
fundamental
fairness
require
that
the
juries
understand
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
my
question
to
you
is
let's
assume
a
case
in
which
that
is
not
the
issue,
a
case
in
which
we're
talking
about
retribution.
i
want
to
narrow
the
issue
down
here.
why
doesn't
fundamental
fairness
require
that
the
jurors
understand
what
the
words
mean?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
he
also
kind
of
snuck
in
the
word
dangerousness
there
in
the...
in
the
30-foot
example,
but
they
don't
count
because
they
weren't
prominent
in
his
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
she
was
outside
prison
when
this
happened.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
he
is
a
danger
inside,
it
follows
that
he
will
be
a
danger
outside
if
he
gets
out.
isn't
that
the
kind
of
common
sense
inference
that
anyone
would
draw?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the...
the
evidence
of...
of
his
dangerousness
included
things
that
he
used
to
like
to
torture
small
animals,
psychiatric
evidence
to
the
effect
that
he
wants
to...
to
take
action,
homicidal
action,
against
anybody
who
annoys
him.
the...
the
word
was
a
little
bit
more
flamboyant
in
the
psychiatrist's
testimony,
but
that
was
the
point.
these...
these
don't
go
to
conditions
that
would
only
come
into
play
inside
of
a
prison.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
brought
out
in
its
cross
examination.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's...
let's
assume
that.
let's
assume
that
was
the...
was
the
point.
the
fact
is
the
evidence
came
out,
and
there's...
there's
no
common
sense
basis
that
i
can
think
of
to
say
that
this
evidence
would
not
indicate
that
if
the
individual
got
out
of
prison,
he
would
be
very
dangerous
to
the
people
he
came
in
contact
with.
and
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
you
couldn't
make
such
an
inference.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
started
all
of
this,
i
thought,
was...
was
the
point
that
you
were
making
that
the
evidence
that
went
to
dangerousness
in
prison
did
not
ground
in
inference
of
dangerousness
outside.
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
really
doesn't
help
you
here
because
here
you
further
had
evidence
of
his
escape
risk.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
this
wasn't
a
guy
who
was
just
going
to
sit
quietly
and...
and
enjoy
his
time
in
prison.
this
is
someone
who
presented
an
escape
risk
and
hence
raised
a
risk
of...
of
acting
out
his
dangerous
propensity
if
he
succeeds
in
escaping.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
in
1996,
the
south
carolina
jury
convicted
the
petitioner
william
kelly
who
agrees
with
the
kidnapping
and
robbery
and
murder.
during
the
separate
sentencing
proceedings,
the
prosecutor
presented
evidence
that
kelly
had
fashioned
crude
knives
while
he
was
in
jail
and
took
part
in
an
attempt
to
take
a
hostage
and
to
escape.
on
cross
examination
of
the
psychologist
the
prosecutor
brought
out
evidence
of
kelly's
childhood
sadism
as
well
of
his
recurrent
homicidal
fantasies.
after
presentation
of
the
evidence
but
before
the
closing
arguments,
kelly's
counsel
relied
on
our
decision
and
simmons
v.
south
carolina
in
requesting
a
so-called
simmons
instruction
to
the
jury,
that
if
kelly
received
the
sentence
of
life
imprisonment,
he
would
be
ineligible
for
parole.
the
prosecutor
objected
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
going
to
argue
future
dangerousness
and
the
trial
judge
denied
the
request
of
charge
ruling
the
state's
evidenciary
submission
went
not
to
future
dangerousness
but
only
to
kelly's
character
and
characteristics.
in
his
closing
argument,
the
prosecutor
compared
kelly
to
a
notorious
serial
killer,
characterizing
him
variously
as
bloody
billy,
the
butcher
of
batesburg
and
as
a
little
more
dangerous
because
he
was
intelligent
and
quick-witted.
thereafter
the
trial
judge
charged
the
jury
without
giving
a
simmons
instruction.
the
jury
recommended
the
death
sentence
and
the
trial
court
imposed
it.
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
affirmed
the
conviction
and
sentence.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
state
supreme
court.
in
upholding
the
trial
court's
refusal
to
instruct
the
jury
on
the
parole
ineligibility,
the
state
supreme
court
advanced
two
rationales.
one
ground
given
by
the
court
was
that
simmons
was
inapplicable
to
south
carolina's
new
sentencing
scheme
because
life
without
possibility
of
parole
was
not
the
only
legally
available
sentencing
alternative
to
death.
we
invalidated
this
ground
in
last
term
in
shafer
v.
south
carolina.
there
we
held
it
well
a
capital
defendant
in
south
carolina
can
under
some
circumstances
receive
a
sentence
less
than
life
imprisonment,
under
the
state's
scheme,
a
jury
makes
a
sentencing
recommendation
only
if
the
the
jury's
first
find
one
or
more
aggravating
factors.
in
the
event
that
they
do
find
an
aggravating
circumstance,
their
recommendations
can
be
only
death
or
life
without
parole.
thus,
the
state's
supreme
court's
reasoning
about
the
availability
of
a
third
sentencing
alternative
cannot
be
accepted.
a
second
ground
given
by
the
state's
supreme
court
in
this
case
for
holding
no
simmons
instruction
was
required
was
that
kelly's
future
dangerousness
was
not
at
issue,
a
conclusion
that
is
in
sharp
conflict
with
the
evidence
presented
in
the
arguments
made
at
kelly's
trial,
the
state
court
failed
to
recognize
that
evidence
may
have
a
tendency
to
prove
future
dangerousness
even
though
that
same
evidence
can
support
other
inferences
or
be
described
in
other
terms,
and
the
state
court
likewise
can
overlook
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
accentuated
the
clear
implication
of
future
dangerousness
raised
by
the
evidence
when
his
argument
invited
the
jury
to
conclude
that
kelly
was
a
dangerous
and
bloody
butcher.
we
find
no
merit
in
the
state's
alternative
argument
here
that
kelly's
jury
was
not
confused
about
the
matter
of
his
parole
ineligibility
because
the
jury
did
not
request
further
instructions
from
the
trial
judge.
a
judge's
obligation
to
give
adequate
explanation
of
the
law
does
not
depend
on
expressions
of
perplexity
by
the
jury
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
kelly's
jury
was
aware
of
relatively
recent
changes
in
south
carolina
law
that
categorically
preclude
parole
for
capital
defendants
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
kennedy
has
joined;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
