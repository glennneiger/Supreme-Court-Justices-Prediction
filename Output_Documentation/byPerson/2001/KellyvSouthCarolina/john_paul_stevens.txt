justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
as
a
matter
of
historical
interest,
when
did
the
requirement
that
the...
i
mean,
when
did...
when
did
the
sentence
of
life
without
parole
first
authorized
by
the
south
carolina--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--1986.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this?
you
gave
us
a
couple
of
examples
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
itself
setting
aside
the
conviction...
or
executions
because
they
had
failed
to
give
the
instruction.
and
you...
you've
just
quoted
the
example
he
mentioned
both
inside
and
outside
prison.
now,
did
they
consider
the...
your
argument
that
if
read
in
the
context
of
the
entire
argument,
it...
it
was
a
featured
part
of
the
argument,
or
did
they...
could
the...
could
one
reasonably
think
that
from
those
opinions,
just
that
mere
mention
was
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
he
was
trying
to
get
the...
prevent
the
jury
from
getting
this
information.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
should
have
been
happy
with
the
instruction
is
what
that
proves.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
should
have
been
happy
with
the
instruction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you're
concentrating
on
what
would
happen
in
prison.
so,
the
instruction
wouldn't
help
you...
it
wouldn't
hurt
you.
it
would
actually
help
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
fellow
is
going
to
be
kept
where
he'll
be
the
most
dangerous.
therefore,
you
should
kill
him.
that's
your
argument.
