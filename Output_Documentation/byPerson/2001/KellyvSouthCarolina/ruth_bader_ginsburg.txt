justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
position...
i
thought
your
position
was
that
this...
that
the
judge
or
the
lawyer
reads
the
text
of
what
it
says
in
the
south
carolina
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
reads
word
for
word
what
the
legislature
enacted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
all
you're
asking.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the
argument
that
everything
that
goes
to
future
dangerousness
also
goes
to
something
else?
the
prosecutor
said,
yes,
i
showed
that
this
was
a
terrible
person
because
he
had
no
prior
record,
and
i
used
the
billy
the
kid
remark
because...
to
rebut
the
age.
so,
i
can
give
you
a
reason,
other
than
future
dangerousness,
for
everything
that
i
put
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
shafer
was
explicit
that
counsel
would
not
be
allowed
to
read
the
statute,
which
is
what
i
think
counsel
wanted
to
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
perhaps...
you
suggested
in
your
brief
that
for
the
future
the
south
carolina
legislature
is
going
to
require
that
the
jury
be
informed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waters,
in...
in
your
view
has
any
south
carolina
prosecutor
since
simmons
used
words
that
would
invoke
that
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
it
seems
to
me
that
any
prosecutor,
if
your
argument
is
right,
can
easily
get
around
simmons
simply
by
not
using
the
words
future
dangerousness
and
saying,
well,
this
is
relevant
to
something
else.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
position
was
if
he
couldn't
live
in
prison,
then
simmons
was
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you
then
concede
that
if
the...
if
the
argument
that
counsel
for
the...
the
prosecutor
makes
is
this
man
is
dangerous
in
or
out
of
prison,
in
that
case
a
simmons
instruction
is
warranted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
hasn't
dealt
with
that
issue,
though,
has
it?
because...
because
simmons
is
relatively
new.
has
there
been
a
case
where
the
prosecutor
says,
okay,
judge,
i
said
future
dangerousness,
but
i
want
to
tell
them
that
the
law
can
change,
that
there's
a
pardon,
that
there's
a
clemency
power?
that
hasn't
come
up,
has
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waters,
it
wasn't
quite
like
that.
he
said
dangerousness,
and
then
counsel
for
the
defense
stopped
him
at
that
point,
and
then
he
came
back
with,
well,
i
meant
dangerous
for
her.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waters,
you
didn't
really
mean...
your
brief
could
be
read
to
say
that...
that
the
lawyer
was
effectively
allowed
to
tell
the
jury
that
life
means
life.
you
said
something
in
your...
the
jury...
that
because
the
line
was
about
defendant
would
never
see
the
light
of
day.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
no
different
than...
from
what
it
was
in
shafer
in
that
respect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
but
you
don't
dispute
that
if
the...
if
the
lawyer
then...
if
she
had
tried
to
say
in
open
court,
now,
jurors,
i'm
going
to
read
you
from
the
south
carolina,
that
she
would
have
her
head
cut
off
by
the
judge.
