treat,
if
you

fairly
shortly
coming
up
in

the

says
that
in

program,
these
sort
of
preferences
that
you're
challenging
are
simply
not
used
in

very

if

counsel

chief

william

well,
but
why,
if
that

was

i

it
seems
to
me
a

of
the
questioning
here
and
to
a-
adarand's
counsel
has
been
to
show
that
adarand
was
directly
affected
by
the
thing.
chief

william

well,
they

00-730,

versus
mineta.
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
review
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
when
it
concluded
that
the
department
of
transportation’s
disadvantaged
business
enterprise
program
is
consistent
with
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
equal
protection.
in
a
per
curiam
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
dismissed
the
writ
of
certiorari
as
improvidently
granted.
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
a
race
conscious
program
that
governs
procurement
of
federal
transportation
funds
to
states
and
localities.
we
presumed
that
the
certiorari
states
that
we
would
be
able
to
review
this
same
program
but
upon
full
briefing
and
oral
argument,
it
is
clear
that
petitioner
is
challenging
a
very
different
race
conscious
program,
one
relating
to
direct
procurement
of
federal
transportation
funds
to
private
contractors.
because
this
program
is
governed
by
a
different
set
of
statutes
and
regulations
than
the
program
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
there
is
no
decision
below
addressing
the
constitutionality
of
the
only
program
petitioner
now
challenges.
we
are
a
court
of
final
review
and
do
not
decide
in
the
first
instance
issues
not
decided
below.
to
do
so
here
would
be
especially
unwarranted
since
the
court
of
appeals
found
petitioner
lacks
standing
to
challenge
the
statutes
and
regulations
relating
to
dot’s
direct
procurement
program.
yet,
petitioner’s
brief
did
not
challenge
this
ruling.
petitioner
points
out
that
this
case
presents
questions
of
national
importance
calling
for
final
resolution
by
this
court.
the
importance
of
an
issue,
however,
should
not
distort
the
principles
that
control
the
exercise
of
our
jurisdiction.
we
find
on
the
record
before
as
to
these
principles
preclude
review
of
questions
upon
which
we
granted
certiorari.
we
dismissed
the
writ
accordingly.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
