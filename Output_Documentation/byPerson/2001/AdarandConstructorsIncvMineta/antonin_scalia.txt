justice
antonin
scalia
challenged
those,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
apply
only
in
the
state
subsidized
programs.
justice
antonin
scalia
lack
of
standing
is
not
always
before
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
cases
you're
citing
are
cases
where
the
both
of
the
parties
assumed
standing
and
the
court
looked
into
it
on
its
own.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
cite
us
any
filing
in
the
district
court
that
specifically
referred
to
section
eight
d
four?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
raised
it,
but
you
surely
didn't
address
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right,
but
all
of
those
other
mechanisms
the
government
says
in
their
brief
have
been
washed
away
by
by
the
by
the
benchmark
study
provision,
which
eliminates
which
eliminates
the
difficulty.
justice
antonin
scalia
say
that
despite
the
benchmark
study,
there
is
still
one
other
objection
we
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
wasn't
discussed
below
and
it
and
had
barely
been
discussed
in
the
briefs
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
asserted
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
maybe
you
say
i
mean,
and
and
they
have
filed
a
a
memorandum
from
arthur
hamilton,
justice
antonin
scalia
program
manager.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
can't
cannot
those
under
under
the
amended
statute,
cannot
some
additional
compensation
be
provided
but
subject
to
the
new
regulations?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
you're
not
employing
them
on
what
basis?
justice
antonin
scalia
provisions
were
specifically
mentioned
in
adarand's
amended
complaint.
justice
antonin
scalia
specifically
mentioned.
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly
didn't
come
as
late
as
the
reply
brief,
mr.
olson.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
precisely
the
issue
that...
justice
antonin
scalia
for
not
applying
them,
mr.
olson?
that
tha-
that's
what
puzzles
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
contracts.
justice
antonin
scalia
think
that
that's
adequate
assurance
to
those
to
those
companies
who
are
competing
for
for
contracts
where
where
the
where
the
prime
contractor
has
signed
a
commmitment
to
to
get
a
certain
a
certain
goal
of
of
minority
participation.
justice
antonin
scalia
told
the
contractors
and
subcontractors?
justice
antonin
scalia
lands
highway
division
engineers.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
and
you
think
they're
they're
they're
they're
not
at
risk
of
that
happening
in
in
in
other
contracts
when
these
provisions
still
exist
in
the
contract
clauses
and
all
we
have
is
is
your
assurance?
if
if
i
were
the
prime
contractor,
i'd
say,
i
better
not
take
a
chance.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
let's
be
clear
about
what
programs
we're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
with
the
contracting
clauses.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
ninety-six
one?
i
i
think
it's
it's
pretty
clear
to
me
that
the
ninety-six
one
did
not
cover
the
contracting
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
probably
certify
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
absolutely.
justice
antonin
scalia
either
social
or
economic,
even
though
the
social
would...
justice
antonin
scalia
irrelevant
to
whether
you
can...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
form
is
attached
to
the
reply
brief
of
the...
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
the
right...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
i'm
just
saying
if
this
isn't
the
right
form,
what
is?
we-
the
the
form
has
not
yet...
justice
antonin
scalia
but
apparently
what
what
the
agency
proposed
proposed
on
may
eighth,
two
thousand
and
one
simply
says,
i
hereby
certify
that
i
am
a
member
of
one
of
the
following
groups
you
check
the
minority
group
and
that
i
have
held
myself
out
as
a
member
of
that
group.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
the
agency
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
social
disadvantage
in
the
business
world.
justice
antonin
scalia
understand
that...
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
right
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
they
but
they
aren't.
justice
antonin
scalia
against
people
from
gabon
but
but
not
from
the
next-door
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
know
they
haven't
been
implemented?
the
the
solicitor
general
tells
us
they
have.
