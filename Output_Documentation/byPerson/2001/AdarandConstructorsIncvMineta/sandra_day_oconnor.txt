justice
sandra
day
o'connor
challenge
below
the
small
business
act
provision,
section
eight
d
four
through
six?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
were
were
h-
did
adarand
bid
on
contracts
issued
by
states
with
federal
assistance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
suit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
the
only
thing
that
you
now
say
you're
challenging
are
contracts
direct
contracts...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
tenth
circuit
seemed
to
think
that
you
did
not
challenge
those
small
business
act
sections
that
i
referred
to.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
have
a
joint
appendix.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
refer
us
to
the
pages
where
you
challenged
section
eight
d
four
through
six?
can
you
say
on
page
so
and
so
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
shows
that
we
did
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
a
separate
question
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
addressed
to
eight
d
four
through
six?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
laidlaw
stood
for
the
principle
that
standing
is
judged
as
of
the
time
the
suit
is
filed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
subsequent
changes
affect
mootness
possibly,
but
not
standing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
was
the
provision
that
was
the
focus
of
the
original
suit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
olson,
does
are
those
clauses
covered
by
section
eight
d
four
through
six?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
thought
that
mr.
pendley
argued
that,
in
fact,
in
colorado
some
of
those
provisions
have
been
and
are,
in
fact,
now
in
contract
forms.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
this
is
new
since
the
tenth
circuit
looked
at
it...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
are
supposed
to
do
now,
please?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
new
things
the
government
is...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
were
the
high
bidder.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
financial
compensation
provision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
now
has
been
found
to
be...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it's
out
of
the
picture.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
now
we
have
a
new
set
of
arguments
basically.
