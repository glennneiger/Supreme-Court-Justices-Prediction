it

mr.

olson
yes,

o'connor.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
y-
if
we
distinguish
between
the
the
federal
aid
program
and...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
federal
procurement
program
and
the
subcontractor
compensation
clauses
the
united
states
government
has
abandoned
in
all
respects,
those
provisions
have
not
been
justified,
and
the
united
states
government
is
not
employing
those.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
on
the
basis
that
that...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
they
they
were
mentioned.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
the
challenge
was
to
the
s-
compensation
clause
provisions.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
the...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
in
at
th-
at
the
beginning
of
the
brief
and
not
addressed
in
those
provisions
were
not
addressed
in
the
arguments
of
the
brief.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
they're
to
be
conducted
every
year,
but
they're
not
actually
being
conducted
that
is
that
often.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it's
one
of
those
one
of
those
government
programs
that
it
it
is
hoped
will
be
conducted
more
often
than
they
actually
get
conducted,

rehnquist.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it's
conceivable,
yes.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
the
subcontract
clause
provisions,
which
adarand
is
now
discussing,
have
been
applied
ever
in
colorado
or
in
those
states
precluded
by
the
benchmark...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
a-
and
also
they
are
required
by
the
holdings
of
this
court
to
apply
and
interpret
that
statute
in
a
constitutional
fashion.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
they
are
in
the
contract
forms,
but
the
depar-
the
that
is
again
another
carryover
of
instances
where
they
probably
should
be
removed
from
the
contract
forms,
but
they're
not
being
in-
implemented
or
enforced
to
impose
any
race-conscious
remedy...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
he
w-
well,
in
the
first
place,
the
three
contracts
that
were
mentioned
in
the
reply
brief...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
adarand
was
not
the
high
bidder
in
those
three
contracts.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
mean
the
low
bidder.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
he
has
got
to
demonstrate
under-
as
i
understand
this
court's
holdings
with
respect
to
standing,
he's
got
to
show
some
immediate
impact
or
the
potential
for
actual
harm.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
no.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
the
the
department
of
transportation
and
the
department
of
justice
have
consistently
adhered
to
the
provision
that
those
race-conscious
provisions
will
not
be
enforced
in
the
direct
procurement
program
in
these
areas.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
they
have.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
this
this...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
justice
scalia,
it
strikes
me
and
i
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
you're
switching
it
around.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i'm
i
i
wouldn't
contradict
that,
but
i
would
say
when
the
government
has
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
it
is
not
enforcing
race-conscious
remedies,
as
instructed
by
this
court
in
in
the
first
adarand
decision,
except
in
in
a
narrowly
tailored
fashion,
there's
been
subsequent
legislation
of
a
compelling
need,
but
that
that
response
to
that
compelling
need
has
been
narrowed
down
to
the
areas
where
it
is
necessary...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
the
the
provision
was
not
removed
in
some
of
those
contracts,
and
i'm
i
can't
tell
this
court
how
many.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
if
they
were
being
enforced
and
adarand
could
suggest
that
it
was
somehow
affected
by
that.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
they
didn't
get
the
contract
because
they
were
were
not
the
low
bidder.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
justice
scalia,
it
has
been
the
demonst-
documented,
articulated
policy
of
the
since
the
department
of
justice
study.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
if
you
look
at
the...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
no.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that
was
in
nineteen
ninety-six.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
well,
the
the
memorandum
in
august
of
of
two
thousand
and
one
reiterates
the
policy
that
the
department
of
transportation
had
been
operating...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
agree
with
you.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
you
a
cite
to
the
record,
but
the
ind-
the
the
i-
the
the
department
of
justice
memoranda
is
in
the
government's
appendix.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
not
have
applied
in
nineteen
eighty-nine
when
this
case
first
arose.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
as
i
say,
they
weren't
not
the
low
bidder
on
that
contract.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
government
has
announced
its
policy,
and
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
it's
acted
inconsistently
with...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
of
race-conscious
remedies
in
the
area...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
important
to
emphasize
that
this
is
a
facial
challenge
to
the
statute
and
to
the
system.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
i
i
respectfully
disagree
with
respect
to
whether
adarand
was
adversely
affected
by
the
program.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
and
they
were
affected
by
the
we're
not
contending
that
they
did
not
have
standing
to
challenge
that
subcontracting...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
and
and
to
the
extent
that
that
the
th-
the
the
program,
as
it
exists,
requires
people
to
in
order
to
be
designated
as
a
disadvantaged
business
enter-
enterprise,
must
file
certificates
articulating
that
they
have
been
the
victim
of
a
social
and
economic
disadvantage.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it's
defined
in...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
it's
it's
it's
explained
in
the
statute
both
with
respect
to
ethnic
and
racial
prejudice
because
of
their
identi-
identity
as
a
group
without
regard
to
individual
qualities,
and
that
economic
disadvantage
the
ability
to
compete
in
the
free
enterprise
system
has
diminished
capital
and
credit
opportunities
as
compared
to
others
in
the
same
business
area...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
both
get
well,
is-
that's
a
social
the
us-
the
use
of
the
term
in
the
statute
described
a
victim
of
of
prejudice
or
bias,
and
that
has
had
economic
effect
on
the
individual.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
no.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
is
not
the
right
form.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
the
the
different
states
use
different
forms.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that
but
that
is
that
is
a-
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
but
the
but
the
but
the
but
that
has
to
be
looked
at
in
terms
of
the
what
the
statute
defines
as
social
and
economic
disadvantage
and
what
the
regulations,
which
are
in
in
at
pages
seventy
to
seventy-two
a
of
the
government's
appendix,
which
define
which
which
are
the
regulation
department
of
transportation
regulations.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
any
adversely
affected
party
can
rebut
it.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
what
you
have
to
show
to
be
entitled
to
certification,
according
to
the
regulations,
is
substantial
and
chronic
social
disadvantage
in
the
business
world
and
that
s-
and
that
credit
has
been
impaired
due
to
diminished
capital
or
opportunities
have
been
impaired
due
to
diminished
capital
and
credit
opportunities,
as
compared
to
others
in
the
same
or
similar
line
of
business.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
social
and
i-
social
disadvantage,
justice
scalia,
is
defined
in
the
statute
as
having
been
a
victim
of
racial
or
or
or
prejudice
of
that
nature,
and
that
ha-
it
has
produced
economic
disadvantage...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
i
i
believe
that
we're
correct.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
and
i
hope
i
said
it
persuasively.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
there's
about
thirty-some
years
of
study
by
congress
of
disadvantage
and
discrimination,
which
this
court
recognized
in
fullilove
and
in
croson
and
in
adarand,
that
is
taking
place
in
the
contracting
industry.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
of
a
certain
racial
background
and
a
certain
color...
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
i
submit
that
when
you
if
you
were
to
describe
different
people
of
different
national
backgrounds
or
racial
backgrounds
that
have
been
guilty
of
discrimination,
they
may
fall
in
any
one
of
those
categories.
mr.
general
theodore
b.
olson
what
what
the
congress
said
over
and
over
again,
on
on
the
basis
of
detailed
analytical
studies
which
are
which
are
described
in
considerable
detail
on
the
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
and
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
there
has
been
the
lingering
effects,
unfortunately,
of
publicly
financed
discrimination
in
the
construction
industry.
