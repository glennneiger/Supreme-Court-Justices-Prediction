mr.
william
p.
pendley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
nineteen
eighty-nine,
the
small
family
business
that
is
adarand
lost
a
federal
contract
because
of
a
racial
program
and
the
race
of
its
owner,
randy
pesh.
in
nineteen
ninety-five,
this
court
held
that
adarand
had
standing
to
seek
forward-looking
relief
because
that
program
prevented
it
from
competing
on
an
equal
footing.
in
two
thousand
one,
adarand
returns
to
this
court
because
it
still
can't
compete
on
an
equal
footing.
[inaudible]
mr.
william
p.
pendley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
your
honor,
adarand
has
challenged
all
manner
in
which
the
pro-
mr.
william
p.
pendley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
what
happened
was
that
the
the
the
district
court
held
that
the
entire
program,
all
of
section
eight
d
of
the
sub-small
business
act,
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
it
it
your
honor,
it
is
the...
mr.
william
p.
pendley
excuse
me.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
correct.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
y-
it
is
not
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
honor,
they
are.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
as
this
court
said
in
adarand
two
thousand,
the
courts
and
parties
have
been
confused
as
to
the
difference
between
standing
and
mootness,
and
the
tenth
circuit
was
confused
as
to
mootness
and
standing,
resulting
in
the
court's
adarand
two
thousand
decision
and
and
it
appears
to
be...
mr.
william
p.
pendley
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
the
issue
of
standing
is
always
before
the
court.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
well,
well
your
honor,
the...
mr.
william
p.
pendley
well,
a-
adarand
believes
that
standing
is
is
fair
under
rule
fourteen
a
is
fairly
included
within
the
questions
presented
because
it
was
plain
error
for
the
tenth
circuit
below
to
hold
that
adarand
did
not
have
standing
because
the
tenth
circuit
below
addressed
the
scc
and
yet
declined
to
address
the
statutory...
mr.
william
p.
pendley
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
yes.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
it's
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
the
direct
federal
procurement
program
which
remains
unchanged.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
well,
the
tenth
circuit
was
abso-
absolutely
incorrect.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
well
your
honor,
i
i
can
cite
to
the
pleadings
t-
that
adarand
filed
in
this
case
where
adarand
asserted
that
all
parts
of
the
program,
all
the
statutory
provisions
that
allow
this
program
to
exist
and
the
united
states
to
implement
it,
h-
have
been
have
been
challenged
by
adarand.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
no,
there
was
not
a
separate
question
addressed
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
we
your
honor,
adarand
had
challenged
consistently
first
first
of
all,
the
subcontracting
compensation
clause
is
one
mechanism
that
the
united
states
developed
to
implement
the
statutory
program
that
adarand
challenges.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
that
adarand
had
standing
at
that
time.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
the
reason
adarand
does
not
agree
with
that
premise
because
the
laidlaw
decision
holds
that
once
adarand
had
standing,
as
a
result
of
this
court's
nineteen
ninety-five
decision,
that
standing
continued
until
such
time
as
the
united
states
somehow
made
the
case
moot
as
the
result
of
revocation...
mr.
william
p.
pendley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
but
so
what
are
the
the
question
before
the
court...
mr.
william
p.
pendley
conclude
that
the
tenth
circuit
was
wrong
in
stating
what
it
stated
in
that
footnote
because
adarand
specifically
challenged
eight
d
four.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
well,
what
what
adarand
addressed
was
the
const-
at
the
tenth
circuit
was
the
constitutionality
of
this
of
this
racial
program,
and
and
there
are
a
number
of
mechanisms
by
which
the
ran-
racial
program
is
implemented
against
adarand.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
it
is
one
of
the
mechanisms
by
which
the
united
states
continues
to
implement
this
this
regime,
this
program.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
w-
in
in
addition,
adarand
adarand
noted
that
the
benchmark
study
allows
it
to
be
turned
on
and
turned
off,
and
it
still
can
be
turned
down
turned
on
in
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
that's
that's
what
our
lodging
demonstrates,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
well,
the
united
states
cannot
assert
that
it
does
not
use
the
mandatory
subcontracting
incentives
because
it's
required
by
law.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
i
i'm
asserting
that
it
violates
law
and
it
violates
the
regulation.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
may
i
finish
this?
i'm
i
apologize.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
i'm
apologize.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
yes.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
your
honor,
the
the
controversy
adarand
presents
in
two
thousand
one
is
that
adarand
still
is
unable
to
compete
on
an
equal
footing
because
the
united
states
still
has
in
its
tool
of
in
its
tool
kit
mechanisms
by
which
it
is
applying
this
racial
preference
against
adarand.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
yes.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
well,
under
strict
scrutiny,
the
court
must
start,
as
croson
dictates,
with
the
question,
has
is
there
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
of
a
compelling
governmental
interest?
congress
declined
this
court's
invitation,
and
generous
invitation,
in
nineteen
ninety-five
to
provide
that.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
there
are
no
findings,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
william
p.
pendley
i-
the
the
government
the
government
concedes,
with
regard
to
the
state
aid
program,
that
that's
not
at
issue
in
this
in
this
case.
