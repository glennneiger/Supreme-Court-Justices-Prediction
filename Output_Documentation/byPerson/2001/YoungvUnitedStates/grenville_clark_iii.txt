mr.
grenville
clark
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
discharging
taxes
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
that
income
taxes
that
are
more
than
3
years
old
are
discharged
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
in
the
petitioner's
case,
the
youngs
filed
a
chapter
7
bankruptcy
proceeding
in
march
of
1997,
some
3
years,
5
months
after
they
had
filed
their
1992
income
tax
return
in
october
of
1993.
the
bankruptcy
code
provides,
on
this
simple
set
of
facts,
that
the
youngs'
1992
income
tax
obligation
is
discharged.
the
operative
code
sections
are
727,
523,
and
507,
which
i
set
out
at
pages
10
and
11
of
my
brief.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
they
did
indeed,
your
honor.
that
was
filed
in
may
of
1996.
it
was
a
chapter
13
proceeding.
it
lasted
just
short
of
6
months,
and
the...
the
argument
that
the
irs
has
tendered
in
this
case
and
below
is
that
you
subtract
out
the
6
months
they
are
in
the
prior
proceeding
from
the
calculation
of
the
3
years,
5
months,
and
when
you
do
that,
you
come
out
with
the
youngs
ending
up
with
being
only
2
years
11
months
away
from
the
3-year
mark--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--it
was
dismissed
at
the
behest
of
the
youngs
for
a
variety
of
reasons
that
did
not
appear
in
the
record.
during
the
chapter
13
proceeding,
they
had
succeeded
in
selling
their
house
and
paying
off
mortgages
on
the
house
that
had...
they
had
placed
on
there.
later
on
in
the
proceeding,
they
had
gone
through
the
trouble
of
engaging
special
counsel,
an
attorney
noreen
farr,
to
do
something
which
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
but
they
finally
decided
that
they
would
dismiss
the
case
rather
than
go
forward
with
it.
the
reasons
that
they
did
not...
do
not
appear
in
the
record.
they
dismissed
the
case
about
3
weeks
before
they
would
have
gotten
to
confirmation
of
their
plan,
which
they
had
submitted
earlier
in
the
case.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
the...
the
bankruptcy...
the
chapter
13
bankruptcy
proceeding
was
dismissed.
the
final
closing
order
in
the
case
was
entered
in
march
of
1997.
the
motion
that...
or
the
request,
i
think,
that
the
youngs
had
filed
was
in
october
of
1996,
october
23,
1996.
it
is
our
position
that
the
automatic
stay
expired
as
soon
as
the
case
was
dismissed
and
not
later
when
the
case
was
closed
a
number
of
months
later.
and
i
think
that
is
significant
because
in
our
view
the
irs
was
entitled
to
restart
their
enforced
collection
efforts
against
the
youngs--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--yes.
it's
in
the
bankruptcy
code
itself,
section
320...
yes...
i'll
have
to
get
the--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--yes.
it's
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
dismissal,
and
that
we
contend
is
the
dismissal.
what
happened
subsequent
to
the...
the
filing
of
that
notice
is
the
chapter
13
trustee
held
some
funds
that
had
been
paid
in.
he
sought
to
apply
for
an
administrative
expense,
and
that
was
put
on
for
a
hearing
and
eventually
it
was
granted.
and
then
thereafter
the
clerk's
office
closed
the
case
in
march
of
1997.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
not
in
a...
not
in
a
chapter
13
where
the
debtor
seeks
dismissal.
the
debtor
has
the
absolute
right
to
seek
dismissal
of
his
chapter
13
case
because
it's
a
voluntary
proceeding.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
yes,
i
am
in
this
situation,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
of...
the
bankruptcy
rules
are
a
little...
were
a
little
vague
at
that
point
in
time.
whether
you
seek
a
dismissal
by
simply
filing
a,
quote,
request
or
moving
for
a
dismissal,
the
rule
says
that
upon
a
request
for
dismissal,
the
judge
shall
dismiss
it.
in
this
particular
case,
the
judge
did
not
actually
enter
an
order
of
dismissal.
it
simply
accepted
the
dismissal
as
entered
or
requested
in
october
of
1996.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
well,
if...
if
there
are
gimmicks,
if
somebody
is
trying
to
manipulate
the
system,
to
game
the
system,
certainly
the
government...
any
party
in
interest
who
was
affected
by
the
gaming,
the
manipulation...
can
object,
can
take...
can
move
to
dismiss...
to
convert
the
case,
for
example,
which--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
no.
the...
the
judge
below,
judge
vaughn
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
found
in
favor
of
the
government,
suggesting
that
there
was
a
potential,
in
similar
cases
such
as
this,
for
abuse
or
manipulation
by
debtors
in
general.
but
in
this
case,
judge
vaughn
had
found
that
he
attributes
no
bad
faith
to
the
youngs
in
this
particular
situation,
and
i
think
that's
an
important
fact.
the
government,
when
it
objected
to--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--it's
certainly
not
in
our
view
bad
faith
to
look
for
a
tax...
for
a
way
to
get
a
grant
of
a
discharge
of
an
obligation
that
you
formerly
owed.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
the
case...
justice
scalia,
the
case
came
before
the
court,
before
the
bankruptcy
court,
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
motion...
by
the
government.
the...
there
was
no
findings
of
fact
as
such
other
than
those
that
were
on
summary
judgment.
the...
what
the...
i
see
judge
vaughn
has...
as
finding
is
that
he
sees
no
evidence
before
the
court
from
which
he
would
infer
any
manipulative
or
abusive
scheme.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
when
bankruptcy...
bankruptcy
debtors
take
advantage--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--that's
exactly
right,
justice--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--justice
breyer,
you
would
have
to
look
at
what
happened
in
the
prior
bankruptcy
i
think
to
see
why
the
debtor
was
able
to
stay
in
bankruptcy
for
the
length
of
time
that
the
debtor
did
and
thereby
supposedly
prevent
the
government
from
collecting
taxes
from
the
debtor.
a
chapter...
usually
the
prior
bankruptcy
is
a
reorganization
bankruptcy,
a
chapter
13,
possibly
a
chapter
11.
during
the
chapter
13
proceeding,
that
had...
had
a
long
life,
the
debtor
had
to
propose
a
plan
that
had
to
pay
the
taxes
that
the
debtor
owed
in
full
over
the
life
of
a
plan,
whether
that
be
3
years,
4
years,
5
years,
whatever
it
was.
the
plan
has
to
go
to
confirmation.
if
the
plan
is
confirmed,
all
the
plan
payments
that
have
accumulated
to
that
point
are
now
paid
out
to
the
government
and
to
other
creditors
in
accordance
with
the
plan.
plan
payments
that
follow
on
still
go
to
the
government
and
to
other
creditors
as
designated
in
the
plan.
the
government
is
getting
money
here
during
the...
during
the
prior
bankruptcy
proceeding.
yes,
a
person
can
file
for
bankruptcy,
submit
a
plan.
it
might
be
a
5-year
plan.
they
get
the
plan
confirmed.
they
make
payments
for
3
years
and
then
they
elect
to
dismiss.
that
is
their
right
to...
to
dismiss.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
no.
no,
your
honor,
they
do
not.
the...
the
plan
payments
have
been
paid
to
the
government
all
throughout
the
3-year
period.
they
have
a
confirmed
plan.
once
you
have
confirmation,
the
confirmation
order
releases
the
money
to
the...
the
payees,
the
creditors,
including
the
government.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
in
the
youngs'
case,
the
government
did
not
receive
any
payments
whatsoever.
the
youngs'
chapter
13
lasted
about...
just
short
of
6
months.
they
had
not
filed
that
tax
case,
that
chapter
13
until
2
and
a
half
years
after
they
had
filed
their
tax
return.
they...
but
they
did
not
receive
any
payment
because
we
did
not
get
to
confirmation
in
the
youngs'
case.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
the
confirmation
hearing
had
been
set
by
the
court
at
the
outset
of
the
case,
and
it
was
scheduled
for
november
15
of--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--it
was...
in
this
particular
case,
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--for
the...
because
they
had
not
gotten
to
confirmation.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
under,
i
think
it's
section
349
of
the
bankruptcy
code
which
governs
dismissals,
the
judge
certainly
has
the
authority
to
put
conditions
upon
the
issuance
of
the
dismissal.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
well,
because
the
debtor...
i
think
the
procedural
problem
here
is
because
the
request...
the
rules,
at
least
at
the
point
of
this
request
for
dismissal
was...
was
made,
were
a
little
vague
as
to
how
you
request
or
move
for
a
dismissal.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
but
the
debtor
has
the
absolute
right
to
request
the
dismissal.
the
effect
of
the
dismissal
the
judge
can
impose
a
condition
on
to
say,
well,
yes,
we're
going
to
dismiss
the
case,
but
we're
going
to
enter
an
order
that
says
you
cannot
count
the
6
months
that
the
youngs
were
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
i
don't...
i
think
the--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--i
think
in
that--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--i...
i'm
not
saying
it's...
i
think
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
court
has
the
ability
to
put
a
condition
on
it.
if
the
judge...
if
the
debtor
doesn't
wish
to
accept
it,
it's
going
to
have
to
withdraw
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
i'm
saying
it's...
justice
scalia,
i'm
saying
it's
automatic
in
the
sense
that
the...
the
debtor
has
an
absolute
right,
quote/unquote...
and
that's
not
an
absolutely
absolute,
but
the
debtor
has
a
right
under
chapter
13
to
have
his
case
dismissed.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
well,
it's...
i
think
it
is
an
absolute
right
or
nearly
so.
i
don't
think
that
putting
a
condition
on
it
makes
it
less
of...
of
an
absolute
right
to
dismiss.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
i
think
the...
well,
i
don't
know
that
the
judge
could
withhold
or...
or
delay
the
entry
of
a
dismissal
order.
it
could
put
a
condition
on
it
that
the
time
in
chapter
13
won't
count
against
the--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--i
do
not
know
of
any
cases
where,
in
a
chapter
13,
a
condition
has
been
imposed.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
well,
i
think
no...
no
judge
is
going
to
impose
the
condition
i
think
under
section
349
unless
the
irs
comes
in
and
makes
a
motion
or
brings
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--well,
they've
gone
a...
the
government
i
think
has
gone
on
a
different
track
on...
on
this
issue.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
the
answer
is
no,
your
honor.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
this...
we
got
into
this
in
the
court
of
appeals
a
little
bit,
but
it
really
makes
no
difference
whatsoever
in
the
computation.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
i
would...
i
would
never...
i
would...
i
agree
with
you,
judge
scalia.
it
would
be
a...
an
abuse
of
the
bankruptcy
process.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
yes.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
yes,
it
is.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
i
think
there
has
to
be...
if...
if
somebody
is
charging
that
there
is
an
abuse,
there
has
to
be
some
factual
determination
that
there's
an
abuse.
the...
under
section
105,
even
the
bankruptcy
judge
himself,
sua
sponte,
can
look
at
this
and
enter
orders
if
he
detects
abuse.
and
bankruptcy
judges
happen
to
be
rather
good
at
this.
they...
they
see
cases
that
emit
an
odor,
if
you
will,
and
they
are
not
reluctant
to
get
involved
in
that.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
kennedy.
here's
what
happened--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--you
could
have...
you
could
have--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--yes,
your
honor,
it
would--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--not
in
my
view,
justice
kennedy,
and
here...
here
is
why.
if
you're
going
to
go...
if
you're
going
to
go
into
chapter
13
and
stay
there
for
3
years,
you're
going
to
get
a
plan
confirmed
during
the
course
of
those
3
years.
you
better,
sure
as
heck,
get
a
plan
confirmed
during
those
3
years.
and
you
will
be...
once
the
plan
is
confirmed,
payments
are
going
to
be
made
to
the
irs
for
those
3
years.
it
may
or
may
not
pay
off
the
debt
to
the
irs
in
full
during
the
3
years,
but
it
is
the
debtor's
best
effort,
according
to
the
chapter
13,
to
be
paying
those
dollars.
so,
it's
not
as
though
the
irs
is
getting
nothing
in
this...
in
that
hypothetical
situation.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
if
there...
justice
o'connor,
if
there
were
no
confirmation
order
entered
prior
to
the
dismissal--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--which
was
the
youngs'
case.
yes.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
yes.
the
magic
moment
in
chapter
13
is
the
entry
of
the
confirmation
order,
and
once
the
confirmation
order
is
entered,
whatever
plan
payments
the
trustee
has
already
accumulated,
because
the--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--i...
i
do
not
think
it
is
proper
at
all
to...
i...
there
are
several
reasons
why
i
think
it's
improper.
first
of
all,
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
is
very
plain
and
straightforward
and
has
no
provision
for
equitable
tolling
or
any
tolling.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
yes,
i'm...
i...
i
know
that
the...
i
know
that
you
have,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
it's...
my
point
is
that
it
is...
this
is
a
part
of
the
definition
of
which
taxes
can
be
discharged
in
bankruptcy.
there
are
several
time
elements
to
defining
which
taxes
can
be
discharged
in
bankruptcy.
there
is
this
3-year
lookback
period.
there
is
a
2-year
period
where
a
taxpayer
has
filed
a
return
late
and
then
we
go
to
a
2-year
lookback.
and
then
there's
a
third
240-day
period
that
the
taxpayer/debtor
must
satisfy
and
that
is
240
days
from
the
date
of
assessment.
now,
the
debtor
must
meet
all
three
of
these
to
be
able
to
discharge
the
taxes.
in
the
youngs'
case,
the
taxes
were
assessed
promptly,
about
2
and
a
half
months
after
they
filed
their
tax
return.
they
clearly
met
that
one.
the...
they
did
not
file
a
late
return
because
they
got
extensions
to
file
their
return
in
october
of
1993.
so,
they...
that
one
doesn't
apply.
and
the
only
one
in
question
in
this
particular
case
then
is
the
3-year,
and
how
do
you
measure
3
years
and
do
you
toll
the
3
years
for
the
period
of
the
prior
chapter
13.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
yes,
justice
souter,
that
is
correct.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
i
think
it
would
be
error
for
a
judge
to
take
a
motion
to
dismiss
a
chapter
13
and
make
it
a
chapter...
and
say,
we
are
going
to
make
it
instead
a
chapter
7
case.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
yes.
justice
souter--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--yes,
justice
souter.
but
keep
in
mind
in
the...
in
the
case
of
either
dismissal
or
conversion,
in
the
example
in
the
government's
brief,
the...
it
does
not
do
any
good
to
seek
conversion...
i'm
sorry...
to
dismiss
and
then
refile
unless
you're
toward
the
end
of
the
3-year
period
in
any
event.
so
that
when
the
case
is
dismissed,
now
the
3-year
period
has
expired,
and
now
you
go
the
next
day
and
you
file
your
chapter
7,
saying,
well,
i've
been...
it's
been
now
more
than
3
years
since
the
filing
of
the
return.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
but
in
the
meantime,
of
course,
the
plan
payments
are
being
made,
hopefully,
to
the
government
and
to
other
creditors
for
the
2
years
and
however
many
months.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
well,
except
that,
justice
souter,
the
problem
is
that
the
tax
payments
are
not
going
to
be
minuscule
during
the
chapter
13.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
that
is
correct,
justice
souter.
but
again,
i
would
point
to
the
fact
that
the
government
is
getting
something.
it
may
not
get
the
whole
amount.
and
in
tax
collection
in
general,
apart
from
bankruptcy,
even
when
bankruptcy
is
not
in
the
picture
at
all,
the
way
the
government
is
trying
to
collect
taxes
is
through
installment
payments
as
the
youngs--
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
--the
government
did
get
nothing
in
this
situation,
justice
ginsburg,
for
the
6
months.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
well,
the
reason
the
chapter
7
was
filed
was
because
i
think
other
creditors
were
descending
upon
the
youngs.
they
had
dismissed
their
chapter
13
back
in
october,
and
that,
of
course,
put
everybody
back
into
the
status
quo
ante,
except
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
their
house,
of
course.
but
the
creditors
now
were
free,
once
the
case
has
been
dismissed,
to
come
forward
again.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
yes.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
with...
with
the
filing
of
the
chapter
13,
they
obviously
gained
the
advantage
also
of
eliminating
their
other
debts.
mr.
grenville
clark
iii
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
the
question,
that
they...
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
they...
they
get
the...
when
they...
when
they
dismiss
and
then
refile,
they
obviously
get
the
benefit
of
discharging
their
other
taxes
in...
their
other
debts,
non-tax
debts.
