justice
david
h.
souter
was
it
a
finding
of
good
faith
or...
or
a
finding
that
he
was
making
no
finding
of
bad
faith?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
clark,
is
the
government
correct
in...
in
pointing
out
that
the
debtor
here
could,
instead
of
seeking
dismissal
of
the
13
and
starting
a
7,
simply
have
moved
to
convert
the
13
into
a
7?
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
if...
if
the
debtor
had
done
that,
the
3-year
period
would
continue
to
have
been
calculated
as
it
originally
was
under
the
chapter
13
proceeding.
justice
david
h.
souter
would...
would
it
have
been
error
if...
if
the
judge
or
any
judge
in
a
case
like
this,
when...
when
confronted
with
a
motion
or
a
request
to
dismiss,
simply
questioned
the
debtor
whether
it
was
the
debtor's
intent
to
start
a
chapter
7
proceeding,
and
if
the
answer
was
yes,
for
the
judge
simply
to
say,
well,
i
will
treat
your
motion
as
a
motion
for
a
conversion
and
we'll
grant
that?
would
that
have
been
error
on
the
judge's
part?
justice
david
h.
souter
even
when
the
debtor
says,
yes,
my
plan,
my
intent
is
to...
is
to
initiate
chapter
7
proceedings.
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
i
take
it
the
only
harm
to
the
debtor
in
that
case
would
simply
be
the...
the
argument
about
the
3-year
lookback
because
the
debtor
would
be
getting
exactly
otherwise
exactly
what
the
debtor
wanted,
i.e.,
a
chapter
7
filing.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that...
that's
so.
but,
i
mean,
even
in
the
case
in
which
there
has
been
a
confirmation
under...
under
the
chapter
13
and
plan
payments
have
been
made,
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
amount
of
tax
liability
that
has
actually
been
paid
could
be
minuscule,
so
that
it
would
be
very
much
in
the
debtor's
interest
to...
to
start
a
new
chapter
7
and
save
whatever
the
balance
due
is
on
the
taxes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
whether
they're
minuscule
or
not,
if
they're
not
100
percent,
the
debtor
still
gains
something
by
going...
so
far
as
the
federal
taxes
are
concerned,
by
dismissing
and
starting
a
chapter
7
because
whatever
the
balance
due
is,
in...
on
the
facts
of
a
case
like
this,
the...
the
debtor
is
going
to...
going
to
obtain.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
right.
but
i
think
the
government's
answer
to
that
is
unless
we,
in
fact,
make
a
compromise
agreement,
we're
entitled
to
100
cents
on
the
dollar.
and
the...
the
fact
that...
that
the
government
may
get
50
cents
on
the
dollar
before
you
go
from
13
to
7
i...
i
don't
think
really
disparages
the
government's
argument
any.
