but
if...
if
taxes
had
been
paid
during
the
chapter
13
proceeding,
wouldn't
they
have
to
have
been
returned
on
the
dismissal
of
that
proceeding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
as
was
the
case
here.

as

the

so,
presumably
even
if
something
had
been
paid
in
for
the
taxes,
they
would
have
been
given
back
on
the
dismissal.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why...
why
do
you
think
it's
improper
to
equitably
toll
that
lookback
period
for
this
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
what
is
your...
what
is
your
main
argument?
is
it
to
ask
us
to
apply
the
principle
of
equitable
tolling
to
this
section
105
lookback
provision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
millett,
there
is
legislation
pending
to
do
what?
how
is
it
drafted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
an
amendment
to
section
105
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
part
of
the
overall
bankruptcy
code
revision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
know,
the
big
bill.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
may
or
may
not
go
anywhere.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
were
the
lawyer
for
the
government
faced
with
a
taxpayer
that
had
a
big
tax
liability
and
it
looked
like
bankruptcy
might
be
looming,
what
would
you
advise
the
government
to
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
doubt,
but
absence
that,
what
is
the
best
way
for
the
government
to
protect
itself,
do
you
think?
