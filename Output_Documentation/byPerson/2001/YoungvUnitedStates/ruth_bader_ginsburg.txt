but
there
was
also
the
fact
that
they...
in
addition
to
dismissing
the
chapter
13,
the
day
before
that
order
was
entered
granting
the
dismissal
at
their
request,
they
started
a
new
bankruptcy
proceeding.
they
started
a
chapter
7
proceeding,
and
that
way
they
were
able
to
stretch
out
the
stay
of
any
effort
the
government
might
have
made
to
collect
the
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
authority
for
that,
for
saying
that...
that
it's
not
the
date
that
the
bankruptcy
was
closed,
but
some...
the
earlier
date
when
they...
when
they
made
that
motion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
they
get
the
payments
back
if
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
much
of
the...
how
much
of
the
tax
liability
did
the
government
receive
during
the
course
of
the
first
bankruptcy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you...
did
you
seek
confirmation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was...
it
was
the
debtors'
voluntary
action
that
stopped
the
government
from
getting
any
payments
under
that
plan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
the
judge--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--when
the
debtor
asked
to
have
the
chapter
13
dismissed,
could
the
judge
have
said,
i
will
enter
the
dismissal
order,
the
closure
order,
but
only
on
condition
that
you
do
not
attempt
to
assert
a
time
bar,
should
you...
as
everybody
knew
was...
that
was
going
to
happen,
go
into
a
successive
bankruptcy
proceeding?
did...
would
the
judge
have
any
authority
to
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
can't
equate
the
date
that
you
file
the
motion
to
dismiss
with
the
termination
of
the
chapter
13.
it
can't
be.
if
the
judge
could
put
a
condition
on
it,
then
the...
the
13
proceeding
doesn't
terminate
until
the
closure
order
is
entered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
it
can
be,
as
it
was
here,
the
government
got
nothing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
would
there...
in...
in
this
very
case
where
the
chapter
7
was
started
the
day
before
the
chapter
13
was
closed,
was
there
any
advantage,
other
than
wiping
out
the
lookback
period,
to
instituting
two
proceedings
rather
than
having
the
13
converted
to
a
7?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we're
getting
into
filing
versus
dismissal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if...
if
we
take
the
order
of
the
court
as
what
counts,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
period
in
which
other
creditors
could
have
jumped
in
because
the
chapter
13
hadn't
yet
been
closed.
so,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
debtors
here,
was
there
any
advantage
that
they
gained
other
than
wiping
out
the
lookback
period?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
when
they
got
to
the
point
of
saying
we're
not
going
to
make
it
under
this
plan,
so
we're
going
to
have
to
quit
the
13,
at
that
point
they
could
have
done...
either
asked
for
conversion
to
7
or
started
a
new
proceeding.
is
there
any
difference
from
their
viewpoint
other
than
they'd
get
the
benefit
under
a
reading
of
the
statute
of
putting
the
government
out
of
the
picture
because
the
3-year
lookback
has
run?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
bankruptcy
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
millett,
mr.
clark
said
in
his
brief
that,
well,
if
you're
going
to
do
this
for
taxes,
the
same
logic
would
apply
to
wage
claims
that
have
a
priority.
what
else
did
he
say?
employee
benefit
claims.
is
that...
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
could
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
as
they
did
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
millett,
would
you
remind
me?
i
think
that
congress
wanted
the
government
to
have
3
years,
and
that
was
a
cutting
back
on
what
the
government
had
before.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
said,
we
gave
you
too
much.
we're
now
giving
you
3
years.
