why
should
we
read
the
statute
regardless,
when
it's
good
faith
or
bad
faith,
as
allowing
the
following?
we
look
back
3
years
to
see
how
much
money
a
bankrupt
filer
owes
the
government.
he's
going
to
have
to
pay
it.
let's
say
it's
$100,000.
he
dismisses
that
after
a
number
of
years,
the
first
bankruptcy,
then
brings
the
second
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
says,
well,
if
we
look
back
3
years
from
the
second
one,
this
$100,000
i
owned...
i
owed
falls
outside
that
period.
it's
simply
a
windfall
to
him
because
he
brought
two
bankruptcy
proceedings
rather
than
one,
and
it's
a
loss
to
the
government
for
no
reason
other
than
his
having
brought
two
bankruptcy
proceedings
rather
than
one.
it
serves
no
purpose
whatsoever
that
i
can
fathom
in
the
bankruptcy
statute,
and
what
purpose
is
there
in
reading
the
statute
to
permit
such
a
result?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
why
is
the
dismissal
automatic,
which
is
what
we
talked
about
at
the
very
first?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
those
are
also...
the
difficult
issue
i
think
in
this
case
is
exactly
what
justice
scalia
has
been
saying,
that
this
isn't
a
traditional
statute
of
limitations.
you
have
to
do
one
of
two
things.
you
either
have
to
say
the
word
3
years
shall
be
read
3
years
plus
days
tolled.
that's
one
thing
you
could
do.
or
the
second
thing
you
could
do
is
you
could
look
to
105(a)
and
you
could
say
that
the
order
that
can
be
issued
is
an
order
pay
money...
this
is
in
the
section
7...
pay
money
as
if
this
were
the
section
13
that
hadn't
been
dismissed.
now,
both
of
those,
the
question
would
be,
does...
does
the
judge
have
the
authority
to
do
that?
and
looking
simply
to
statute
of
limitations
provisions
doesn't
answer
that
question.
it...
it
provokes
the
question.
it
proves
you
might
be
right,
but...
but
the
worrying
thing
is
whether
you
can
just
stick
those
words
in,
either
plus
days
tolled,
or
read
105(a)
in
so
broad
a
manner.
so,
those
are
the...
i'd
like
to
know
what
should
we
do
and
what's
the
authority
for
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
plus
days
tolled.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
no
problem
convincing
me
about
what
i'd
call
the
equitable
merits
of
your
side.
the
problem
you
have,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
is
how
to
work,
which
route
do
we
take
and
what's
the
authority
for
doing
it,
just
what
i
asked
in
the
first
place.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
argument
doesn't
hinge
on
bad
faith,
anyway,
as
i
understand
it.
