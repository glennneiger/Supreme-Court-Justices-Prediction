justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
dismissal,
which
was
october
23?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
anyone
object
to
the
notice
of
dismissal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
there
was
a
finding
of
good
faith
here,
wasn't
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
bad
faith
to
look
for
a
tax
loophole?
i
think
thought
that's
what
all
the
tax
attorneys
always
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
it
be
manipulative
or
abusive
just
to
take
advantage
of
the
provision
of
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
the
finding
doesn't
make
any
difference
one
way
or
the
other,
does
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
just
saying
you
have
a
statutory
right
to
do
what
you
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
this
is
totally
speculative,
really,
i
think.
i
would
assume
if
the...
if
this
problem
has
occurred
as
many
times
as
the
government
says
it
has,
and
if
the
solution
that
you
suggest
is
available,
i
would
have
thought
some
judge
would
have
thought
of
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
the
lawyers
have
never
had
enough
sense
to
do
this,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
answer
is
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in...
in
all
events,
let's
assume
that
we
think
that
the
dismissal
occurs
in...
it
would
be
march
13.
does
the
difference
between
october
and
march
make
a
difference
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
whose
burden
is
it
to
show
that
there
was
some
reason
other
than
just
getting
advantage
of
the
automatic
stay?
do
you
have
to
put
in
any
evidence
to
show
that?
i
mean,
you're
suggesting...
i
guess
justice
scalia's
question...
that
there
should
be
a
fact
question
in
every
case
as
just
what
was
the
motivation
of
the
petitioner
who
file
the
chapter
13
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
suppose
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
is
commenced
with
the
intent
ultimately
of
getting
the
discharge,
but
there's
also
the
intent
to
do
it
in
two
steps.
you
say,
i'm
going
to...
i
want...
i
want
to
get
chapter
13
or
chapter
13...
11,
but
i'm
just
going
to
do
it
in
two
steps.
is...
is
that...
that
abuse
of
process?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
hypothetical
is
i...
the
bankrupt
intends
to
get
a
bankruptcy
discharge,
but
he
also
intends
to
do
it
in
two
steps.
he
intends
to
have
a
chapter
13,
wait
for
3
years,
and
then
after
a
very
short
interval,
refile
under
7.
and
then
hypo
two
is
under
13.
i
take
it
you
can
do
it
under
13?
couldn't
you
have
two
successive
13?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
argument
would
be
the
same.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
either
of
those
cases,
would
that...
would
that
be
abuse
of
process
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
thought
your
point
is...
one
of
your
points
was
that
statutes
of
limitations
are
different
from
this,
that
this
is
not
a
statute
of
limitations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
one...
one
technical
question.
i
should
know
the
answer.
suppose
before
the
chapter
13
proceeding
is
commenced,
the
government
says,
oh,
we've
got
a
lot
of
taxes
here
and
this
debtor
may
file
chapter
13.
can
you
file
a
lien
against
his
property
which
somehow
protects
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
would
protect
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you...
if
you
imposed
a
lien,
could
you
still
work
with
the
taxpayer?
the
lien
doesn't
prohibit
you
from
trying
to
work
it
out,
does
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
just...
just
so
i
get
the
technical--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
once
the
chapter
13
proceeding
commences,
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--cannot
impose
a
lien.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
view
of
the
automatic
tolling
statute?
as
i
understand
this
case,
the
notice
of
dismissal
of
the
chapter
13
proceeding
was
filed
in
october,
and
the
actual
dismissal
was
not
until
march
13
of
the
following
year.
and
it
was
the
day
before
that
that
they
filed
the
chapter
7
so
there--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--was
the
base
of
their
changing
their
mind
or
something
like
that.
is
it
your
view
that
the
automatic
stay
was
in
effect
between
october
and
march?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
i
think
your
opponent
seemed
to
suggest
maybe
that
wasn't
so.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
it
true
that
in
this
case
there
was
some
kind
of
report
filed
on
february
2?
so,
there
was
activity
in
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
aware
of
any
cases
of
this
kind
in
which
the
court
has
imposed
a
condition
relating
to
this
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
doesn't
authorize.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that...
that
brings
me
to
this
question.
suppose
i
thought
that
section
105(a)
was
the
best
basis
for
an
authority
for
a
tolling
rule
under
the
abuse
of
process.
would
it
follow
that
the
tolling
rule
has
to
be
on
a
case-by-case
basis
to
determine
if
they're
good
faith,
or
can
i
say
because
of
abuse
of
process,
we're
going
to
have
a
general
tolling
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
that
consistent
with
my
assumed
approach
of
just
hinging
the
rule
on
the
abuse
of
process?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
