v.
the
united
states.
mr.
clark.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
also
filed
an
earlier
bankruptcy
petition,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
was
the
first
chapter
13
petition
dismissed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
used
the
term
seek
dismissal,
move
to
dismiss
in
october,
and
then
the
proceeding
was
actually
dismissed
in
march.
are
you
saying
that
your
simple
motion
to
dismiss
is
the
same
thing
as
having
it
dismissed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
whole
sequence
of
events
seems
a
bit
gimmicky.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
held
that
equitable
tolling
applies
in
similar
statutes
which
have
no
provision
for
equitable
tolling.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government
got
nothing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clark.
ms.
millett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
speak
up
a
little
bit,
ms.
millett?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
government
comes
forward
after
3
years,
it
loses.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
00-1567,
young
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
