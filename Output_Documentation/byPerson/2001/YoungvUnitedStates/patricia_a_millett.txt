ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
first
the...
there's
been
some
discussion
about
protections
that
maybe
or
maybe
could
not
occur
in
a
chapter
13
proceeding
to
prevent
the...
the
government
from
losing
its
claim.
and
in
fact,
that
rarely,
if
ever,
is
capable
of
happening
because
we
don't
know...
debtors
don't
telegraph
to
us
at
the
time
they're
in
chapter
13
or
dismissing
their
chapter
13...
that
they
plan
to
file
a
second
bankruptcy.
and
if
you
don't
know
that's
going
to
happen,
you
can't
prove
bad
faith.
you
can't
ask
for
conditions,
or
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
to
do
that.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think
there's
two
difficulties
with
that
approach,
and
the
first
that
it
would
be
an
enormous
burden
in
every
chapter
13
case
that
is
filed
and
then
sought
to
be
dismissed...
and
an
awful
lot...
the
vast
majority
are...
to
have
that
inquiry
undertaken.
and
secondly,
there
is...
there
is
no
authority
under
the
code
that
we're
aware
of
that
allows
a
court
to
condition...
a
voluntary
dismissal,
which
they
have
as
of
right,
on
willingness
to
forego
a
discharge
in
a
future
bankruptcy
proceeding.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
we
would...
we
would
want
the
3-year
lookback
period
to
tolled
during
the
time
the
automatic
stay
prevented
us--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
as
the
chief--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
what
we
do.
as
the
chief...
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
in
fact,
equitable
tolling...
in
virtually
every
case
that
i'm
aware
of,
equitable
tolling
is
applied
when
the
statute
is
silent,
and
in
fact
when
it
may
provide
specifically
for
tolling
in
other
circumstances,
as
occurred
in
bowen
v.
city
of
new
york
and
american
pipefitters
v.
utah.
and
equitable
tolling
has
not...
never
been
held
to
turn
upon
the
existence
of
bad
faith.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
there
is
and
there
has
been
for
a
number
of--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
your
honor,
there's...
there's
a
number
of
responses
to
that.
and
the
first
is
we
would
respectfully
disagree
that
this
is
not
sufficiently
analogous
or
akin
to
a
statute
of
limitations
that
the
first
circuit
described
in
this
case
to
merit
equitable
tolling.
a
time
period
does
not
have
to
be
a
statute
of
limitations
to
be
tolled.
in
zipes
v.
twa,
in
honda
v.
clark,
this
court
has
applied
equitable
tolling
to
other
types
of
time
limitations,
and
within
the
bankruptcy
context,
which
is
a
specialized
context,
this
lookback
period
has
the
same
operation
and
effect
as
a
traditional
statute
of
limitations.
it
prevents
the
assertion
of
stale
claims,
stale
claims
defined
as
ones
that
the
government
has
allowed
to
linger.
it...
it
extinguishes
a
claim
if
the
period
does
lapse
as
effectively
as
a
bar
on
the
time
limitations.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
this--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
not
entirely
correct,
justice
scalia,
for...
for...
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
there
are
two...
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
priority.
there's
a
priority
as
against
other
creditors,
but
what
is
at
issue
here,
and
again
what
is
at
issue
in
virtually
all
of
these
chapter
7
cases,
or
these
no...
no-asset
chapter
7
cases,
is
the
discharge.
that's
what's
at
issue
here,
and
the
discharge
is...
does
extinguish
a
claim
as
much
as
a
bar
on...
on
filing.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
taxes
have
always
been
different.
and
the...
the
treatment
of
this
is
simply
a
3-year...
3-year
period
that...
that
the
debtor
has
to
run
out,
and
it
doesn't
afford
the
government
any
capacity
to
enforce
the
claim
would
be,
i
think,
an
extraordinary
assumption
on
the
part
of
congress.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
section
507.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes,
that
is...
that
is
our...
that
is
our
submission.
the
congress--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
body
of
equitable
tolling
cases,
but
the
most
analogous
one
i
think
is
honda
v.
clark...
clark
and
burnett
v.
new
york
central
railroad,
both
of
which
are
cited
in
our
brief.
honda
v.
clark
involved
not
a
traditional
statute
of
limitations,
but
the
time
for
filing
proofs
of
claim
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act,
which
was
specifically
modeled
on
the
bankruptcy
act.
and
there...
there
the
court
held
that
it
would
be
equitably...
equitably...
the
time
period
would
be
equitably
tolled--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
within
the
bankruptcy
context,
in
fact
a
claim
can
still
be
paid
as
long
as
it's
on
the
schedules.
the
filing
of
a
proof
of
claim
does
not--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the...
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
honda
v.
clark
was...
was
that
congress
modeled...
the
proof
of
claim
there
may
have
been
closer
to
an
actual
statute
of
limitations,
but
the
rationale
the
court
applied
was
looking
to
the
treatment
of
proofs
of
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
that
was
the
analogy
that
congress
was
drawing
at
the
time
it
enacted
the
trading
with
the
enemy
statute,
and
that
those
proofs
of
claim...
it
was
in
the
bankruptcy
context--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--and
nassau
smelting
v.
refining
works,
which
is
discussed
in
honda
v.
clark,
was
a
bankruptcy
case
where
the
proof
of
claim
was
not
filed
until
a
year
after
the
deadline
and
the
court
allowed
participation
nonetheless.
and
again,
it's
the
nature
of
the
proof
of
claim
that's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--to
take
the
first...
the
first...
first
scenario
first,
the
proposition
for
reading
the
3-year
lookback
period
as
3
years
plus--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--3
years
plus.
in
deciding
what
the
character
of
the
lookback
period
is,
whether
it's
akin
to
the
statute
of--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--in
deciding
what
the...
the
character
of
the
lookback
period
is,
equitable
tolling
does
apply
in
zipes
in
filing
a
proof
of...
filing
of
a
claim
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission.
there
the
court
described
it
as
similar
to
a
statute
of
limitations,
but
it
was
not
a
statute
of
limitations.
so,
equitable
tolling
does
not
require--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--zipes
v.
tw...
trans
world
airlines.
that
does
not
require
the
presence
in
the
actual
statute
of
limitations.
it
has
to
be
a
time
limit.
if
the
question
is
whether
congress
would
have
intended
that
type
of
time
limit
to
be
subject
to
tolling
principles.
and
the...
we
can
either
assume
the
lookback
period
would
have
for
many
of
the
policy
reasons
that
have
been
discussed...
the...
the
conclusion
that
results
if
we
decide
that
it
is
not
something
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
be
subject
to
equitable
tolling
is
that
the
3-year
lookback
period
is
an
empty
gesture
as
far
as
protecting
the
government.
the
congress--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--and
that
is
i
think...
and
it's
both
prongs
of
your...
of
your
question.
it
is...
we
think
that
the
nature
of
the
time
limitation
is
sufficiently
similar
within
the
bankruptcy
context.
this
is
how
you
enforce
claims
within
the
bankruptcy
context.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
this
is
exactly
the
situation
that
you
described.
it's
like
a
typical
statute
of
limitations,
and
that
is
unless
the
government
takes
action
within
3
years
to
enforce
its
claim,
unless
it
acts
within
those
3
years,
it
will,
for
all
intents
and
purposes
and
all
practical
purposes,
within
the
unique
context
of
bankruptcy
proceedings,
have
no
claim
left.
it
will
be
discharged.
there's
nothing--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
right.
it
eliminates...
and
the
legislative
history
describes
this
quite...
from
congress'
vantage
point
that
this
was
an
enforcement
period,
a
collection
time,
and
that...
that
if
the...
it
would
eliminate
stale
claims,
which
this
court
said
in
zipes
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
it
would...
it
would
extinguish
liability
if
the
government
doesn't
act
within
the
particular
period
of
time,
which
again
is
akin
to
a
traditional
statute
of
limitations.
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--if
we...
if
we
have
assessed
the
taxes,
which
in
itself
requires
a
90-day
period
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
if
we
have
assessed
the
taxes,
which
we
had
here,
we
can
go
file
a
notice
of
federal
tax
lien
which
would
protect
us.
what
happened
in
this
case--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that
would
protect
us,
but
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
how
tax
collection
works.
the
irs,
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
as
a
matter
of
some
statutory
provisions,
tends
not
to
descend
immediately
upon
taxpayers
the
second
there's
a
liability.
in
this
case,
we
had
been
working
with
the
youngs,
and
they
had
been
making
some
payments.
and
it's
routine
for
us
to
try
voluntary
compliance.
it's
good
policy
and
that's
what
we
do,
and
it
wasn't...
we
tried
to--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--we...
we
could
have,
but
it
certainly
has
some
consequences
for...
for
the
taxpayer.
and...
and
again
we...
we
try...
we
try
to
work
these
things
out
without
going
to
that
sort
of
adversarial
level
of
proceedings.
and
there
had
been
payments
being
made
here.
but
if
i
could
get
back
to
justice
breyer's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--sure.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
we
cannot
impose--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--absolutely
not.
that's
part
of
the
automatic
stay.
if
i
could
get
back
to
justice
breyer's
question.
what
we
think
is
important
here
is...
is
the...
the
combination
of
the
two
factors
that
you
discussed
is
that
this
is
sufficiently
like
a
statute
of
limitations,
and
congress
intended
it
to
operate
like
a
statute
of
limitations,
and
it
does
operate
like
a
statute
of
limitations
within
the
bankruptcy
context.
and
we've
combined
that
with
the
unique
equitable
powers
the
bankruptcy
courts
have
and
the
unique
operation
of
equitable
principles
within
the
bankruptcy
context.
so,
it's
not
an
either/or.
i
think
the
combination
of
those
is
a
sufficient
reason
as
to
why
tolling
of
this
lookback
period
would
be
appropriate.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
those
are
the
only
two
nontax
provisions
that
have
these
type
of--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--lookback
periods.
and
i...
i'm
assuming
that
it
would,
in
fact,
apply.
i...
i
haven't
analyzed...
the
same
analysis
would
apply
and
assuming
that
the
same
congressional
purpose
would
be
shown
and
the
consistency
of
congressional
purpose
to
apply
equitable
tolling...
it
would
apply
there.
it
doesn't
actually
happen
to
be
a
problem
in
that
area
because
those...
for
two
reasons.
those
types
of...
those
two
claims
involve
very,
very
short
time
limits,
90
and
180
days,
not
3
years.
and
so,
in
order
to
avail
themselves
of
this
procedural
roundabout,
they
would
have
to
file
two
bankruptcy
proceedings
very
closely
on
top
of
each
other,
and
that
just
doesn't
happen.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no.
i
mean,
they
would
have
to
file
their
first
one,
and
then
within
3
months
to
get
out
of
the
90
days,
you'd
have
to
file
another
one.
this...
the
first
one
lasted
i
guess
approximately
6
months.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it...
it
is
drafted
to
provide
for
tolling
of
the
lookback
period
during
the
pendency
of...
during
the
time
an
automatic
stay
in
a
prior
bankruptcy
case.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
it's
to
section
507,
which
is...
507(a)(8),
which
is
what
provides
the
lookback
period
itself.
but
that
legislation--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
is.
it
has
not
been--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
big
bill.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
which
may
or
may
not
go.
there
are...
there
is...
there
are,
you
know,
different
bills
before
congress.
they've
both
been
passed.
conferees
have
been
appointed.
they
aren't
fighting
over
this
provision,
but
there
are
lots
of
other
provisions
that
they
are
in
disagreement
over.
i
also
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
what...
what
we
would
have
to
assume
congress
intended
were
we
to
read
the
lookback
period
as
something
not
subject
to
tolling.
now,
there
have
been
some
suggestions
that
people
like
to
avail
themselves
of
tax
loopholes.
that's
usually
done
to
decide
how
much
taxes
you
owe.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
an
admitted
acknowledged
tax
liability
that
they
want
to
get
out
of
paying
and
that...
that
we
want
to
hold
that...
that
debtor--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--depending
on
this
court's
holding,
there...
i
have
to
say
in
all
candor
the
volume...
the
sheer
volume
of
cases
that
the
irs
handles
in
bankruptcy
makes
much...
and
it's
handled
often
at
the
initial
stages,
as
it
was
here,
not
by
lawyers,
but
by
special
agents
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
i
think
we
would
have
to
go
to
a
system
where
we
would
go
to
the
tax
liens
immediately,
but
that's
not
what--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--to
immediately
as
soon...
as
soon
as
they
assess,
immediately
file
a
tax
lien.
and...
and
that's...
normally
we
go...
there
are
administrative...
other
administrative
means
of
collection.
we
try
to
work
things
out.
we
have
offers
in
compromise,
and
there's
no
reason
that
congress
would
have
intended
our
tax
system
to
go
that
way
and
to
be
driven
by
these
bankruptcy
procedures.
again,
to
get
back,
we're
talking
about
whether
the
lookback
period--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think...
i
think
that
given
the
equitable
powers
of
bankruptcy
courts,
most
of
those...
many
of
those
time
limits
are
in
fact
considered
to
be
subject
to
equitable
tolling
that
are
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
although
i
don't
know
that
this
court,
other
than
the
proof
of
claim
context,
has
ruled
on
the
question.
but
in
deciding...
congress
legislated
against
backdrop
principles
of
equitable
tolling.
in
deciding
whether
this
is
the
type
of
thing
that
should
be
subjected
to
equitable
tolling,
this
court
made
clear
in
american
pipe
&
construction
v.
utah
that
it's
a
question
of...
of
congressional
intent,
not
whether
you
think
the
provision
is
substantive
or
procedural.
and
we
think
congressional
intent
drawn
from
the
structure
of
the
statute,
the
network
of
tolling
provisions,
limitations
on
filings,
conversion
rules,
to
think
that
all
of
those
were
put
in
by
congress
not
to
protect
the
government's
enforcement
period
but
simply
to
channel
debtors
into
one
particular
procedural
route
for
not
paying
taxes
is
a
highly
unlikely
assumption.
and
to
think
that
congress
would...
to
read
the
lookback
period
as
intentionally
empowering
debtors
not
to
fight
about
how
much
taxes
they
owe,
but
to
take
an
admitted
tax
liability
and
say
that
because
of
what
we
do
in
bankruptcy,
not
because
of
anything
the
government
did
in
becoming
a
creditor
or
in
enforcing
its
claim,
we
get
to
decide
that
you
will
not
have
prioritized
status.
you
will
have,
in
some
cases,
not
a
minute
of
enforcement
activity,
and
we
don't
have
to
pay
our
taxes.
that
makes
the
government
not
like
other
creditors
at
all,
not
at
the
same
level,
but
in
the...
the
states
and
federal
governments
will
be
in
the
worst
position
of
anyone
in
bankruptcy.
we
don't
get
to
choose
our
debtors.
we
don't
get
to
seek
the
security
in
advance,
and
we
will
have
no
capacity
to
enforce,
other
than
at
the
mercy
of
the
debtor
who
initiates
these
proceedings.
and
i
think...
i
understand
this
isn't
a
perfect
fit
with
the
statute
of
limitations,
but
i
think
taking
those
considerations
and
the...
the
consequences
of
accepting
the
alternative
view
of
the
lookback
period,
the
implausible
assumptions
that
would
assume
congress
made
and
the
implausibility
of
this
operation
of
the
statute
as
a
whole
combined
with
the
traditional
equitable
powers
of
bankruptcy
court
and
the
role
of
equity
in
these
proceedings,
all
of
that
packaged
together
is
sufficient
to
allow
this
court
to
toll
a
lookback
period
and
effectuate
congress'
intent,
which...
which
is--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
absolutely,
and--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
in
1307(b),
which
is
the
provision
that
allows
automatic...
it's
11
u.s.c....
that
allows
voluntary
dismissal
by
the
debtor,
provides
that
the...
that
the
debtor
may...
may
ask
the
court,
but
that
the
court
shall
dismiss
the
case.
and
so,
until
a
case
has
been
dismissed
or
closed,
neither
of
which
would
have
happened
under
this
provision
until
march,
or
a
discharge
has
been
granted,
which
obviously
did
not
happen
in
this
case,
the
automatic
stay
remains
in
effect.
and
we
were
unable
to
do
any...
take
any
steps
to
enforce
our
claim.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
there
was.
a
trustee
had
filed
a
report,
and
there
had
been...
the
court
set
time
when
it
got
the...
the
notice,
it
set
the
time
for
the
hearing
on
this
or
time
for
action
on
this.
so,
it
was
in
fact...
and
again,
if...
if
we're
going
to
suppose
that
courts
can
impose
conditions
on
these
dismissals,
that
would
again
require...
assume
that
the
case
is
alive
and
is
still
before
the
court.
but
i
think
the
statute
is
quite
clear
that
it...
that
the
debtor
doese
not
dismiss
the
case;
the
court
does.
and
that
didn't
happen
until
march.
and
again--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
and
again
because
i
think
the
statute
doesn't--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
don't
want
to
say
it
doesn't
in
case
we
get
to
some
situation
where
we
might
want
to
try,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to...
clearly
to
allow
that
and
i
think
it
would
be
extraordinary
reading
of
the
bankruptcy
code
to
think
that
a
court
can
impose,
as
a
condition
on
a
voluntary
dismissal
that's
entirely
within
the
discretion
of
the
debtor
to
seek.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
we
do
not
accept--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
court
has
the
authority
to
impose
uniform
rules
of
equitable
tolling.
it
did
that
in
the
burnett
v.
new
york
transportation
case.
that
was
a
federal
employer
liability
action--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think
what
it
would
be
consistent...
equitable
tolling
as...
equitable
estoppel
tends
on
the
behavior
of
bad
faith
of
the
person
who's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--here
the...
the
debtor.
equitable
tolling
turns
upon
the
legal
disabilities
imposed
on
the
person
who
wants
to
enforce
their
claim.
and
that
isn't
going
to
change
from
case
to
case,
as
in
bowen
v.
city
of
new
york
where
this
court
again
applied
a
class-wide
rule
of
tolling
because
the
government's
actions
with
the
social
security
plaintiffs
in
that
case
had
been
the
same.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no.
no,
it
doesn't.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
of
no
taxes
or
to
get
out
of
paying
their
taxes
or
to
relegate
the
government
to
this
lowest
subsidiary
position
within
the
bankruptcy
process.
but
uniform
rules
have
been
applied
by
this
court
when
that
circumstance
doesn't
change,
and
in
this
case
for
purposes
of
equitable
tolling,
what's
not
going
to
change
is
that
the
government
hasn't
had
the
time
congress
gave
it
in
the
statute.
that's
going
to
be
the
same.
beyond
that,
amount
of
tax
liability
shouldn't
matter.
that's
a
judgment
for...
for
congress
and
the
government
to
take.
it's
not...
it
shouldn't...
equitable
tolling
shouldn't
turn
upon
that,
and
the
bad
faith
or
good
faith
of
the
taxpayer
wouldn't
be
determinative.
and
in
that
regard,
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
if
we
had
a
test
where
we
had
to
show
bad
faith
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
again
we're
talking
about
an
enormous
volume
of
bankruptcy
cases.
and...
and
showing...
in
those...
in
those
circuits
where
they
have
applied
this
sort
of
case-by-case
equitable
tolling,
the
government
has
had
to
be
very
selective
in
which
cases
it
decides
to
make
that
showing,
giving
a
lot
of
people
a
pass
on
taxes.
and
those
proceedings
can
take
9
to
12
months.
you
have
to
have
discovery
and
full-blown
hearings
on
people's
faith
and
intentions
and
that
really
is
not
what
the
purpose
of
the
bankruptcy
code
is
for.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
absolutely.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
absolutely,
and
that's
why
i
think
it...
it's
extraordinary
to
think
that
congress...
congress
went
to
the
steps
that
you
would
have
to
decide,
if
you
decide
this
is
not
a
collection
period
and
akin
to
a
statute
of
limitations,
because
prior
to
1966,
these
tax
claims,
regardless
of
age,
were
all
entitled
to
priority
and
were
all
nondischargeable.
and
what
congress
did
in
1966
was
decide
it
was
going
to
balance
competing
interests
within
the
bankruptcy
process
and
condition
the
government's
entitlement
to
that
special
status
on
its
diligent
enforcement
of
those
tax
claims.
and
that
is
why
it's
like
a
statute
of
limitations.
but
to
hold
otherwise
is
to
say
that
what
congress
went
to
in
1966
was
a
situation
where
everything
was
protected
to
where
nothing
is
protected
except
at
the
sole
discretion
and
choice
of
the
debtor
proceeding
in
bankruptcy.
the
government
will
be
left
with
no
capacity.
we
can't
choose
our...
we
can't
choose
our
debtors,
and
we
will...
and
they
have
the
entire
authority
to
prevent
any
enforcement.
and
we're
not
just
talking
about
enforcement
of
claims
that
arose
before
they
filed
bankruptcy.
if
you
have
bankruptcy
proceedings
that
go
on
for
more
than
3
years,
as
many
do,
this...
this
rule
would
apply
to
tax
claims
that
arose
while
the
case
was
in
bankruptcy
and
the
3
years
ran.
and
that
in
fact
is
what
has
happened
in
a
case
we
have
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit.
if
they
can
discharge
not
just
the
things
that
you
may
have
had
a
few
months
before...
or
a
year
before
the
bankruptcy
was
filed,
tax
claims
that
we
have
never
had
a
millisecond
outside
the
freedom
of
the
automatic
stay
to
enforce
will
be
extinguished,
not
because
of
anything
the
government
did
or
did
not
do,
but
solely
because
of
the
procedural
steps
taken
by
the
debtor
in
bankruptcy
court.
and
we
think
it's
extraordinary
to
think
that
that's
what
congress
did
and
intended
to
do
in
1966.
the...
it
went
for
that
transformation.
and
statutes
aren't
to
be
construed
to
assume
that
congress
would
imperil
state
or
federal
revenues.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
i
think
equitable
tolling,
particularly
in
the
context
of
traditional
equity
courts
like
bankruptcy
and
traditional
equity
proceedings,
is
appropriate.
again,
in
american
pipe,
this...
thank
you.
