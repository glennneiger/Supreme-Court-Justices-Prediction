justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
that's
what
the
judge
meant...
meant
by
not
attributing
bad
faith?
he
didn't
even
think
that
your
client
was
legitimately
trying
to
take
advantage
of
a
tax
loophole?
that...
that's
what
i
took
it
to
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
debtor...
the
debtor
has
a
right
to
reject
that
condition
and
say,
if
that's
the
condition,
i
don't
want
to
dismiss,
i
assume.
and
if
that's
so,
then
the
dismissal
is
not
automatic.
i
mean,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
has
a
right
to
reject
that
condition,
then
once
you
say
the
judge
may
impose
a
condition,
you
have
to
say
that...
that
dismissal
does
not
occur
automatically
once
you
request
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
we
don't
know,
until
the
judge
enters
an
order
of
dismissal,
whether
he's
going
to
put
a
condition
on
it.
so,
how
can
you
say
the
dismissal
is
automatic
as
soon
as
you
request
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but...
no,
but
you
say
he
doesn't
because
the
judge
can
say,
i'll
let
you
dismiss
it
if.
whereupon,
the
debtor
can
say
no...
no
deal.
so,
it's
not
an
absolute
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
say
we
disagree
with
you
and
we
find--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clark,
can
i
get
your
understanding
of
what
you
think
would
be
manipulation?
because
it
may
have
something
to
do
with
my
view
of...
of
this
case.
you
don't
assert
that...
that
somebody
can
go
into
a
chapter
13
proceeding
with
the...
with
the
avowed
intent
of
not
carrying
it
through
to
completion
and
of
dismissing
it
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
of...
of
the...
the
shorter
lookback.
suppose...
suppose
i
open
a
13
proceeding
and
i
have
no
intention...
i
propose
a
plan.
i
have
no
intention
of
completing
that
plan.
i
ask
the
court
to
approve
it.
from
the
beginning,
i
have
no
intention
of...
of
going
through
to
the
end
of
it.
isn't
that
a
fraud
on
the
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
that
were
shown,
i
suppose
there's
no
doubt
that
the...
that
the
bankruptcy
court
in
the
later
proceeding
could
disallow
the...
the
shortening
of
the
lookback
period
because
of
that
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so,
we're
talking
here
only
about
cases
in
which
someone
in
good
faith,
at
least
as
far
as
the
irs
can
approve,
commences
a
13
proceeding,
and
then
for...
for
some...
some
plausible,
good
reason,
before
it
is
concluded,
dismisses.
is
that
how
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--understand
the
situation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
the
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
sure
you
can.
you
can
ask
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
inquire
and...
and
say
if...
if
that
is
the
plan,
your
honor,
we...
we
request
that
it
not
be
dismissed
but
rather
converted.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
that
that
be
a
condition
of...
of
the
dismissal
that
you
not...
that
you
not
refile.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
i
mean,
let's
assume
someone
has
in
all
good
faith
commenced
a
chapter
13
and
has
in
all
good
faith
dismissed
it
because,
part
the
way
through
it,
said,
you
know,
i
think
i
can
make
it
on
my
own
now,
and...
and
then,
you
know,
sometime
after
that,
decides,
no,
i
can't
make
it
and...
and
files
another
bankruptcy
proceeding
under
7.
no
bad
faith.
you
would
still
want
to
alter
the
3-year
lookback
in
the
statute
to
make
it...
to
make
it
what?
5
years
or
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
there's
no
fraud
here.
there's...
there's
nothing
going
on.
you're
just
saying
here's
a
loophole
in
the
tax
law
or
the
bankruptcy
law,
that
aspect
of
the
bankruptcy
law
dealing
with
taxes.
i'll
call
it
a
tax
loophole.
and
you're
saying,
you
know,
courts,
repair
this
loophole.
that's
not
what
courts
normally
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
the
fun
of
practicing
tax
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
take
all
the
joy
out
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
equitable
tolling
in...
in
the
statute
of
limitations
sense.
what
is
involved
here
is
not
the
termination
period
for
bringing
a
cause
of
action,
but
rather
the
quite
different
question
of
when
taxes
will
be
discharged
and
when
they
don't.
congress
provided
for,
you
know,
a
3-year
lookback.
in
some
circumstances,
they
get
the
benefit
of...
of
less
than
that
if...
if
they
brought
the
two...
but
at
least,
where
there's
been
no
fraud,
at
least
where
you
haven't
been
able
to
show
that...
that
they
were
gaming
the
system
intentionally,
i
don't
see
why
equity
should...
should
come...
there
is
legislation
pending
to
close
this
gap,
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
why
we
don't
leave
it
to
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
extinguish
it.
the...
the
government
is
just
thrown
in
with
the
other...
with
the
other
creditors,
isn't
it?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
may
come
out
without
any
money,
but
it's
just...
the...
the
question
is
whether
the
government
is
going
to
have
the
preferred
position
of
not
having
its
debt
discharged.
it
will
be
thrown
in
with
the
other
general
creditors.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know,
but
it...
but
it
discharges
the
government's
claim
just
the
way
it
discharges
the
general
creditors'
claims.
the
government
is
thrown
into
that
pot
instead
of
having
the
preferred
position
that
you
can
pay
off
everybody
else
3
cents
on
the
dollar,
but
not
the
government.
all
that
happens
is
the
government
goes
in
with
the
other
creditors.
isn't
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what's
your
best
case
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
a
traditional
statute
of
limitations?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
a
traditional
statute
of
limitations?
your
claim
is
invalid
unless
you
file
it
within
a
certain
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
i'm
talking
about
the
case
you're
citing
us
as...
as
being
analogous
to
this
one.
you
said
it
didn't
involve
a
traditional
statute
of
limitations.
why
did
that
not
involve
a
traditional--
justice
antonin
scalia
--maybe,
but
trading
with
the
enemy
statute
itself
contained
what
was
a
statute
of
limitations,
and
in
the
case
at
hand,
we
were
equitably
tolling
what
was
effectively
a
statute
of
limitations.
what's
your
other
best
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
case
was
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
similar.
i...
i...
i
mean,
the
only
thing...
the
only
respect
in
which
it's
similar
is
that
it
involves
time,
but
all
of
the
other
cases
that...
that
you
refer
us
to,
the
statute
of
limitations
proper,
zipes,
they're
all
cases
in
which
action
by
the
party
seeking
to
enforce
something
is
limited
by
a
period
of
time.
he
has
to
do
it
within
a
certain
time
or
else
it's
no
good.
now,
whether
you
call
it
proof
of
claim
or
anything
else,
that's...
that's
the
scenario.
in
this
case,
it's...
it's
not
a
matter
of
whether
the
government
has
filed
in
time
at
all.
this
lookback
is
quite
a...
quite
a
different
animal.
it's
how
far
back
you...
you
can
go
in...
in
deciding
which
claims
cannot
be
discharged
in
bankruptcy.
now,
it
involves
time.
i
guess,
if
you
think
that's
enough
of
a
commonality,
then...
then
i'd
agree,
but
gee,
i...
i
don't
think
that's
enough
to...
to
make
me
think
that
we
have
the...
the
authority
by
long
tradition
to
rewrite
a
statute
so
that
where
it
says
3
months,
it's
going
to
be
3
months...
3
years,
it's
going
to
be
on
our
authority
3
years
plus
some
other
period
of
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
not
a
limitation
on
the
government's
action
within
3...
it
doesn't
say
the
government
has
to
act
within
3
years.
it
says
when
you
have
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
you
look
back
only
3
years.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
how
soon
the
government
has
to
come
forward.
the
government
has
absolutely
no
control
over
that
lookback.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
how
they
wrote
it.
i...
i
mean,
you
say...
congress
often
does
not
enact
perfect
statutes.
it...
it
leaves
some
holes
that
it
should
have
thought
about
and...
and
we
don't
normally
think
it's
our
job
to
patch
it
up.
i...
i
agree
with
you.
i...
i
find
it
unlikely
that
congress
intended
this
to
work
this
way,
but
it
is
just
one
of
the
eventualities
that
they
didn't
have
in
mind,
and
that's
why
we
have
things
called
statutory
amendments.
we...
we
don't
run
to
the
courts
and
ask
the
courts
to
fix
them.
and...
and
i'm
just
very
leery
of
extending
our...
our
powers,
the
equitable
powers
that
we've
used
in
the
past,
for
extending
statute
of
limitations,
tolling
statute
of
limitations
to
this
quite
different
situation
of
a
lookback.
i...
and
there
are
other
lookbacks
in
the
internal
revenue
code
and
there
are
other
time
provisions,
and
i...
i'm
not
willing
to
say
whenever
there's
a
time
provision,
it's
an
invitation
to
us,
if...
if
congress
hasn't
foreseen
every
problem,
to
adjust
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
assert
that...
that
without
the
tolling,
we
would
frustrate
congress'
intent
even
where
there
has
been
no
bad
faith,
that
congress
would
not
have
intended
where
there's
good
faith
to
give
the
person
an
added...
an
added
couple
of
years
of...
of
no
taxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
i
don't
think
anybody
suggests
that
congress
intended
the
result.
the
question
really
is
whether...
assume
we
know
exactly
what
congress
intended.
do
we
have
the
authority
to
fill
a
gap
in
the
statute
anyway
without,
you
know,
the
express
text?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
that
income
tax
indebtedness
has
eighth
priority
in
bankruptcy
and
is
non-dischargeable.
this
provision
applies
however
only
to
tax
indebtedness
pertaining
to
returns
due
within
three
years
before
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition.
this
is
commonly
known
as
a
three-year
lookback
period.
the
internal
revenue
service
assessed
the
tax
liability
against
petitioner's
cornelius
and
suzanne
young
for
their
failure
to
include
payment
with
their
1992
income
tax
return
filed
on
october
15,
1993.
they
have
gotten
an
extension
from
the
normal
filing
date.
on
may
1,
1996,
slightly
less
than
three
years
later,
the
young’s
filed
a
chapter
13
bankruptcy
petition
which
looks
to
reorganization
of
indebtedness.
they
move
to
dismiss
this
petition
however
before
a
reorganization
plan
was
approved.
on
march
12,
1997,
the
day
before
the
bankruptcy
court
dismissed
the
chapter
13
petition;
the
young’s
filed
another
bankruptcy
petition,
this
time
under
chapter
7.
a
discharge
was
ultimately
granted
and
the
case
was
closed.
when
the
irs
subsequently
demanded
that
they
pay
the
tax
debt,
petitioners
asked
the
bankruptcy
court
to
reopen
the
chapter
7
case
and
declare
the
tax
debt
discharge.
since
the
debt
pertain
to
a
tax
return
due
more
than
three
years
before
their
chapter
7
filing,
petitioners
argue
that
it
fell
outside
the
bankruptcy
code
three-year
lookback
period
and
therefore
had
been
discharged.
the
court
reopened
the
case
but
sided
with
the
irs.
petitioner’s
tax
return
was
indeed
due
more
than
three
years
before
their
chapter
7
filing
but
it
was
also
due
less
than
three
years
before
their
earlier
chapter
13
filing.
holding
that
lookback
period
is
tolled
suspended
during
the
pendency
of
a
prior
bankruptcy
petition,
the
court
concluded
that
1992
debt
had
not
been
discharged.
the
district
court
and
the
first
circuit
agreed.
we
affirmed.
the
lookback
period
we
conclude
is
a
limitations
period
subject
to
traditional
equitable
tolling
principles.
petitioners
contend
it
is
a
substantive
component
of
the
bankruptcy
code
not
a
procedural
limitations
period
for
two
reasons:
first,
because
it
defines
a
subset
of
claims
that
received
special
priority
in
bankruptcy;
and
second
because
the
irs
may
discover
an
unpaid
tax
after
the
three-year
lookback
period
has
commenced.
we
find
these
arguments
unpersuasive.
all
limitations
periods
define
a
subset
of
claims
that
are
eligible
for
certain
remedies
and
it
is
not
uncommon
for
limitations
period
to
commence
before
claimant
is
aware
that
he
has
a
complete
and
present
cause
of
action.
congress
is
presumed
to
draft
limitations
periods
in
light
of
the
principle
that
such
periods
are
subject
to
equitable
tolling
unless
tolling
would
be
inconsistent
with
statutory
text.
we
believe
tolling
is
appropriate
here.
petitioner’s
chapter
13
petition
are
acted
on
automatic
stay
under
section
362(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
which
prevented
the
internal
revenue
service
from
taking
any
steps
to
collect
the
unpaid
taxes.
when
petitioners
later
filed
a
chapter
7
petition,
the
three-year
lookback
period
therefore
excluded
time
during
which
their
chapter
13
was
pending.
because
their
1992
tax
return
was
due
within
the
three-year
lookback
period
after
accounting
for
tolling
the
lower
courts
properly
held
that
petitioner’s
tax
debt
was
not
discharged
when
they
were
granted
a
chapter
7
discharge.
the
court’s
decision
is
unanimous.
