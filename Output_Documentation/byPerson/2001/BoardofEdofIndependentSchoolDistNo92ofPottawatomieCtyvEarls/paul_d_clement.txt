mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
i
think
in
a
case
like
that,
it
still
might
be
appropriate
for
the
school
district
to
test
the
students
involved
in
extracurricular
activities,
and
i
think
that
is
because,
as
this
court
has
emphasized
on
a
number
of
occasions,
by
making
the
the
the
testing
program
applicable
only
to
an
avoidable
activity,
the
the
school
district
would
be
ensuring
the
reasonableness
of
the
program
under
the
fourth...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
a
couple
of
points
in
response
to
that,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
think
it's
that
odd,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
be
surprised
to
find
a
school
district
that
didn't.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
drug
counseling,
i'm
not
sure
they
want
to
ask
him
w-
what
groups
are...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
stevens,
we
think
such
a
program
would
be
constitutional,
but
we
think
the...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
you
we
we
do
have
that
difference,
but
we
think
a
program
like
this
is
constitutional
for
three
reasons.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
two
points,
justice
souter.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
i
mean,
i
th-
i
think
i-
w-
one
fact
is
that
i
think
it
is
increasingly
becoming
true
that
these
these
sorts
of
policies
are
in
in
society
as
a
whole.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
i
would,
justice
souter.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
i
would
like
to
say
two
things
in
response
to
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
i
i
do
think
it
would
properly
recognize
that
the
school
context
is
different,
and
that
school
boards
have
a
freer
hand
in
testing
their
students
than
the
government
has
testing
either
employees
or
it's...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
the
danger
is
this.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia,
and
i
would
i
would
add
that
this
is
not
the
only
context
where
where
where
the
federal
government
has
recognized
that
difference.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
a-
absolutely,
and
i
think
it's...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
and
i
and
i
don't
think
it's
rocket
science
also
to
say
that
that
that
concern
is
particularly
acute
with
respect
to
the
youngest
and
most
vulnerable
members
of
society.
