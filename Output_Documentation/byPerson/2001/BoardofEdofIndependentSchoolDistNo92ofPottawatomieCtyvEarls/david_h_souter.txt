justice
david
h.
souter
of
the
the
reports
that
have
been
filed
up
to
the
eve
of
the
adoption
of
this
regulation
by
the
school
district
with
the
feds,
year
after
year
after
year,
saying,
things
are
fine
here?
the
only
thing
we
have
to
worry
about
is
is
some
beer.
justice
david
h.
souter
were
they
were
saying
at
the
same
time
that
they
didn't
have
a
problem
with
with
what
we
usually
refer
to
as
drugs.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
understand
it,
e-
since
the
testing
has
been
carried
out
among
the
the
class
of
people
subject
to
this
challenge,
there
have
been
only
three
instances
of
of
any
drug
use
found.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to
me
that
your
evidentiary
problem
is
up
to
the
eve
of
adopting
the
regulation,
the
school
district
was
saying,
we
don't
have
a
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
know,
will
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
the
argument
in
vernonia
and
i
thought
the
opinion
in
vernonia,
in
assessing
the
particular
interest
of
the
district,
repeatedly
emphasized
the
particular
problems
with
the
athletes.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
what
you're...
justice
david
h.
souter
valid
argument
i
i
suppose
an
equally
valid
argument
would
i-
for
for
testing
everybody
would
be
our
object
is
to
stop
drug
use,
not
to
penalize
people
who
go
out
for
band.
justice
david
h.
souter
drug
use
among
those
who
do
not
go
out
for
band?
justice
david
h.
souter
good
that
you
can
test
everybody?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
you're
arguing
is
is
is
a
justification
for
the
present
policy
that
you've
got,
and
i
understand
your
position
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
the
whole
notion
of
special
need
has
has,
more
or
less,
evaporated.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
you,
justice
david
h.
souter
that
reason,
adopt
as
a
as
one
of
your
sanctions
or
a
supplementary
sanction
simply
publicity
that
the
person
had
been
caught?
anybody
who
fails
the
drug
test
will
have
his
name
and
photograph
posted
on
the
bulletin
board.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
agree
to
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
y-
you
would
make
and
i
think
you've
said
this
the
same
argument
if
they
had
decided
to
have
a
universal
drug
testing
policy
in
the
school.
justice
david
h.
souter
th-
that
point,
i
i
the
the
so
called
special
need
has
become
virtually
a
universal
need.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
and
the
special
need
would
be
a
universal
need
in
every
school
in
the
united
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
the
case,
what
is
the
danger
in
the
school
case,
comparable
to
the
to
the
railroad
worker's
danger
or
the
the
the
customs
officer's
danger?
what
is
the
danger
as
distinct
from
simply
the
desire
to
deter
illegal
drug
use?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
what
do
you
th-
what
do
you
say
just
frankly
to
the
argument,
forget
individualized
need,
forget
special
need
entirely,
forget
suspicion.
