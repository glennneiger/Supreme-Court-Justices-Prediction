justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
tecumseh
school
district
enacted
a
drug
testing
policy
that
requires
all
middle
and
high
school
student
to
consent
to
drug
testing
in
order
to
participate
in
any
extra
curricular
activity.
respondent
high
school
students
and
their
parents
brought
a
section
1983
action
against
the
school
district.
alleging
that
the
policy
violates
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
the
school
district
failed
to
identify
a
special
need
for
testing
student
who
participate
in
extra
curricular
activities.
relying
on
our
decision
in
vernonia
school
district
versus
acton,
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
school
district
and
upheld
the
policy.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
held
that
the
policy
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed.
in
vernonia,
we
upheld
the
suspicion
research
drug
testing
of
athletes.
in
doing
so,
we
relied
heavily
on
the
fact
that
the
policy
tested
children
attending
public
schools
and
this
such
was
undertaken
in
furtherance
of
the
government
responsibilities
as
guardian
and
tutor
of
children
entrusted
to
its
care.
we
apply
vernonia’s
principles
to
the
somewhat
different
facts
of
this
case.
first,
the
nature
of
the
privacy
interest
allegedly
compromised
by
the
drug
testing
as
minimum
as
students
affected
by
the
policy
have
a
limited
expectation
of
privacy.
second,
the
invasion
of
the
students’
privacy
is
not
significant
given
the
minimally
intrusive
nature
of
the
sample
collection
and
the
limited
uses
to
which
the
test
results
are
put.
the
tests
results
are
not
turned
over
to
any
law
enforcement
authority,
nor
do
the
results
lead
to
imposition
of
disciple
or
have
any
academic
consequences.
finally,
considering
the
nature
and
immediacy
of
the
government's
concerns
and
the
efficacy
of
the
policy
in
meeting
them,
we
conclude
that
the
policy
effectively
serves
the
school
district's
interest
in
protecting
the
safety
and
health
of
the
students.
accordingly,
we
hold
that
the
policy
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment
because
it
is
a
reasonable
means
of
furthering
the
school
district's
important
interest
in
the
determining
drug
use
among
school
children.
