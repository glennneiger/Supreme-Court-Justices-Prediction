mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
the
tecumseh
school
board's
decision
to
implement
a
suspicionless
drug
testing
pro-
policy
for
students
in
competitive
activities
as
a
reasonable
response
to
student
drug
use.
tecumseh's
policy
represents
a
natural,
logical,
and
rational
application
of
this
court's
decision
in
vernonia
v
acton.
vernonia's
policy
applied
to
students
who
chose
to
participate
in
interscholastic
athletics.
tecumseh's
policy
applies
as
well
to
athletics,
but
also
to
all
the
other
competitive
activities
that
are
offered
by
the
district.
respondents
do
not
challenge
the
policy
as
applied
to
the
athletics,
conceding
that
this
court
approved
that
practice
in
vernonia.

it
it
covers
a
wider
variety
of
interscholastic

activities.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
well,
your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
that
is
true.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
e-
i-
the
district
court
in
vernonia?
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
in
this
case.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
yes,
we
do
have
evidence
of
drug
use
w-
i-
with
these
students
in
extracurricular
activities.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
they
were
lying.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
they
said
it
e-
it
wasn't
a
major
problem
at
that
time.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
let
me
a-
answer
the
second
part
first.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
y-
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
and
in...
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
your
honor,
in
fact,
it
it
really
did.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
and
i-
and
vernonia's
evidence
as
well
showed
that
there
was
not
a
specific
drug
problem
among
athletes.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
and
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
well,
e-
e-
your
honor,
we
have
never
said
that
the
the
students
in
interscholastic
competitive
activities
are
the
only
students
or
even
the
most
likely
students
to
be
abusing
drugs.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
that
was
the
testimony
of
the
of
the
board
president,
dean
rogers.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
i
think
it
is
at
page
a
hundred
and
six,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
well,
e-
e-
yes,
he
sa-
he
says
that
initially,
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
i
just
know
that
all
age
levels,
all
categories
categories
if
we're
categorizing
the
students
that
frequent
the
park.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
y-
your
honor,
the
use
of
ed-
of
of
drugs
among
the
students
in
competitive
activities
was
just
one
of
the
factors
as
to
why
the
tecumseh
board
selected
that
group.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
or
or
prevent
parents
from
bring
persecuted...
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
no,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
yes,
yes,
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
i-
i-
your
honor,
the
i-
the
p-
the
purpose
of
this
program
is
not
to
discipline
students.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
yes,
your
honor,
i
i
i...
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
w-
well,
number
one,
i
i
think
there
is
a
deterrent
effect
for
implementing
this
program
among
the
student
general
student
body.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
i-
if
they
want
to
try
out
or
d-
or
aud-
audition
for
one
of
those
competitive
activities,
they
know
in
advance
that
one
of
the
regulations
i-
i-
i-
is
to
be
subjected...
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
well,
i
think
there
is
a
an
a
reasonably
good
argument
for
that.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
even
if
we
utilize
the
balancing
test
that
was
utilized
in
vernonia,
i
i
think
there
is
a...
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
e-
exactly,
your
honor,
and
and
that
really
is
our
position
because...
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
you
can
remain
in
the
class.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
well,
your
honor,
we
had
to
draw
a
line
somewhere,
and
and
e-
even
though
elective...
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
well
well,
elective
courses
are
really
mandatory,
your
honor,
in
many
cases.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
ye-
i-
yes
your
honor.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
if
we
could
fashion
a
way
to
do
it,
i
believe
the
majority
of
school
boards
would
be
behind
it.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
no
no,
your
honor,
and
in
fact,
that
only
happens
in
this
policy
under
the
third
time...
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
w-
well,
i
think
g-
i
think
children
who
engage
in
these
activities
really
want
to
compete.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
very
cruel,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
so
whether
it
is
constitutional
or
not
i
we're
we're
not
in
in
in
the
job
of
disciplining
students.
ms.
linda
m.
meoli
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
waive
the
remainder
of
my
time.
