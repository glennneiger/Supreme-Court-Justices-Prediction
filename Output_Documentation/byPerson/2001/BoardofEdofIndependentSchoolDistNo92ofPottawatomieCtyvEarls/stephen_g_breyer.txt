can
have
medical
metal
detectors
in
schools
where
they're
afraid
the
children
have
guns?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
there's
no
individualized
suspicion
there,
is...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
throat
swabs
if
you
feel
that
there
is
a
contagious
disease?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i
i
raised
that
because,
of
course,
everyone
is
making
a
criminal
law
analogy,
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nobody
is
arrested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
and
i
just
wonder.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
absolutely
clear
there
isn't
individualized
suspicion,
so
you
win
automatically
if
that's
the
test,
i
would
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
course,
it
wasn't
in
vernonia.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
have
a
record
here
that,
of
course,
suggests
if
you
want
to
know
if
drugs
are
going
on
in
your
school,
you
ask
the
kids.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
really
see
how
that
de-
re-
i
mean,
you
know,
you
might
be
able
to
drive
a
millimeter
of
light
between
that
and
vernonia.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
try,
but
i
i
can't
i
i
mean,
i
i
i
they
did
what
i
would
have
done.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
get
a
positive
response
when
it's
a
question
of
drugs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
if
i
read
the
cases,
as
i
do,
and
they
logically
require
you
to
win,
that's
the
end.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
just
in
case
it's
open
i
would
i
would
like
to
know
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
two,
we
don't
want
to
put
the
student,
although
we'd
really
like
to,
to
the
choice
of
school
versus
drug
testing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
behind
the
question
is
that
i
think
undoubtedly
you're
right,
that
this
is
a
slight
expansion
of
vernonia.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they've
come
in
with
a
brief
on
the
other
side
and
said,
you
know,
despite
the
fact
that
we're
spending
x
billion
dollars,
two-thirds
of
which
goes
on
the
supply
side
for
interdiction...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
demand
has
stayed
constant
among
teenagers,
and
it's
about
twenty
to
thirty
percent
of
all
of
the
children
in
these
high
schools
who
take
drugs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
be
constitutional,
to
say
here's
a
particular
problem,
twenty
to
thirty
percent
of
the
kids
are
taking
drugs,
and
we
want
to
come
in
with
a
solution
that's
tailored
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
than
i
thought...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wha-
if
that
if...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
then
then
then
i-
then
there
is
the
problem
you
talked
about,
which
i
just
heard
you
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
may-
maybe
they
exaggerated
in
that
report.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
didn't
put
numbers
on
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
used
the
word
serious
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
o-
in
your
opinion
a
school
that
did
find
that
it
was
within,
let's
say,
half
the
average,
say
twenty
percent
or...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
percent,
and
they
did
feel
that
a
significant
number
of
their
extracurricular
activity
students
were
involved
in
that,
if
if
they've
th-
heard
that
through
hearsay
or
any
other
way
that
was
reasonably
plausible
for...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
could
then
do
this
in
your
opinion.
