suppose
you've
had
a
s-
s-
hard
statistical
evidence
to
show
that
the
kids
that
go
out
for
the
extracurricular
activities
are
the
ones
that
d-
really
do
not
use
drugs,
that
the
high
drug
user
population
is
in
those
that
don't
engage
in
the
activities.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
hardly
a
revelation
that
the
government
is
concerned
about
what
drugs
do
to
our
culture.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
rocket
science,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
me
let
me
ask
y-
ask
you
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
what's
happening
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
me
if
a
school
is
better
than
other
school
districts
s-
s-
insofar
as
drug
use,
they
have
less
drug
use,
that
they're
maybe
entitled
to
keep
it
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
say
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
in
loco
parentis
argument
works
against
you
there
too
because
in
loco
parentis
also
indicates
that
all
children
are
forced
to
go
to
this
school.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we
have
to
accept
that
a
majority
of
the
parents
want
to
make
sure
that
those
children
are
in
a
drug
free
atmosphere.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
they
have
they
and
and
you
you
seem
to
me
to
be
disparaging
about
police
dogs
and
locker
locker
searches,
maybe
that's
what
you're
going
to
challenge
next.
justice
anthony
m.

rights
of
other
children...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
who
want
to
go
to
a
school
which
is
drug
free,
if
they
can.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
me
that's
part
of
in
loco
parentis
too
because
those
students
are
required
to
go
to
the
school
just
as
as
the
drug
user
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
school
district
said,
we're
going
to
have
two
schools
and
you
can
go
to
either
one.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
don't
have
dogs
or
or
tests
or
anything
else.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
and
and
and
the
other
school
and
the
other
school
is
they
have
m-
mandatory
testing
for
everybody.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
vast
experience
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
there're
drug
users
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
parent,
no
parent
would
would
send
the
the
child
to
the
first
school
that
i
suggested,
other
than
perhaps
your
client
wants
to
go
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
doesn't
don't
magnet
schools
have
rules
for
uniforms
and
s-
and
so
forth
that
that
are
they're
completely
optional?
a
school
district
could
have
two
schools,
one
with
one
with
no
testing,
the
other
with
testing.
