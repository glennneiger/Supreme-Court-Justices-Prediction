didn't
we
say
in

e-
that
in
skinner,
which
was
the
th-
railroad
employee
testing
case,
we
did
not
demand
that
it
be
shown
that
the
particular
railroad
had
a
drug
problem?
didn't
we
say
it
was
enough
that
there
was
a
nationwide
problem?
justice

we...
justice

skinner,
and
we
adverted
to
that
in

justice

so...
justice
antonin
scalia
far,
do
you,
d-
in...
justice

to
in
order
to
justify
limiting
it
to
those
who
participate
in
in
voluntary
activities?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
even
if
we
could
drug
test
anybody,
we
made
the
choice
of
giving
a
student
who
feels
that
strongly
about
not
undergoing
drug
testing
the
ability
to
avoid
it
by
simply
not
engaging
in
the
extracurricular
activities.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
for
that,
it'd
be
a
good
idea,
though,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
any
school
in
the
country
doesn't
have
a
drug
problem?
justice

skinner
and
von
raab,
we
imposed
or
we
permitted
the
imposition
of
drug
testing
on
the
basis
of
a
nationwide
problem,
didn't
we,
without
without
showing
that
the
particular
entity
in

shared
in
that
national

justice

so
there
goes
your
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
argument

justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
what
i
miss
in
your
argument
is
any
recognition
of
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
minors.
justice

proposition
that
the
only
valid
basis
for
conducting

searches
is
to
is
to
enable
the

to
maintain
discipline.
justice

long
as
you
have
a
bunch
of
druggies
who
are
or-
or
a
orderly
in
class,
the

can
take
no
action.
justice

is
that
what
you
want
us
to...

life
and
death
is
is
i-

justice

that.
justice
antonin

a-
a-
as
far
as
as
far
as
the
extent
of
the
drug
use
is
concerned,
th-
this
is
an
elected
school
board,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin

w-
w-
why
why
should
i
trust
your
assessment
of
how
serious
the
drug
problem
is
and
what
measures
are
reasonable
to
counter
that
that
seriousness
over
the
assessment
of
of
the
local
citizens
who
who
elect
their
school
board,
and
their
school
board
says
we
have
a
big
enough
problem
that
we
want
to
use
this
draconian
measure?
