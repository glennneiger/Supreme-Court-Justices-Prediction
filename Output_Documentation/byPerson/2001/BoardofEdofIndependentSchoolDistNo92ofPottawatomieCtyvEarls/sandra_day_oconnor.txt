well,
this
policy
goes
beyond
what
was
permitted
in
vernonia,
does
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
greatly
expands...
well,
it
covers...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
number
of
students
covered
by
the
policy.
justice
sandra

o'connor
and
the
evidence
is
not
as
strong,
i-
is
it,
in
this
case
of
drug
use
in
the
school
as
as
was
the
case
in
vernonia?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
go
by
the
district
court's
findings,
that's
what
you'd
conclude.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
young
people
who
were
involved
in
these
particular
extracurricular
activities?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there're
some
we
we
had
an
amicus
brief
by
some
pediatrics
association
and
so
forth
that
pointed
out
that
students
that
engage
in
these
extracurricular
activities
are,
indeed,
the
least
likely
to
be
involved
in
drug
use.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
so
counterintuitive,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
face
of
a
school
district
that
h-
certifying
to
the
federal
government
they
don't
have
a
drug
problem.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
alcohol's
the
problem,
why
don't
they
address
that?
this
is
just
i
i
i
mean,
i-
it's
structured
in
a
way
to
do
very
little
good
it
seems...
