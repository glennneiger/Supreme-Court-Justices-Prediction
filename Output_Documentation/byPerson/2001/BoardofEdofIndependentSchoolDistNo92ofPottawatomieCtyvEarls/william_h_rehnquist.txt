is
that
is
that
the
correct
pronunciation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
meoli,
okay.
the
third
time
is
the
charm.
[inaudible]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
existence
of
a
policy
might
be
expected
to
deter
drug
use
so
that
you
would
have
fewer
i-
instances
after
it
was
imposed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
l-
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
answer
the
question,
will
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
meoli.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
presumably
a
year
round
thing
in
a
way
that
football
is
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
are
you
saying
that,
for
instance,
choir
in
t-
tecumseh
is
only
in
the
fall?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
winter
or
only
in
the
spring?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
give
me
an
ou-
wh-
wh-
wha-
which
which
season
of
the
four
season
is
for
band
in
tecumseh?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
make
any
difference
why
you
applaud
it
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
saying
that
the
in
loco
parentis
principle
does
not
apply
in
the
case
of
a
school
if
a
minority
of
parents
object
to
what
the
school
is
doing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thought
that
was
what
you
were
saying
a
moment
ago?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
how
did...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
hazelwood
fit
that
description?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
think
the
reason
in
hazelwood
w-
was
ju-
wh-
the
discipline
was
justified
was
i-
i-
caused
disruption,
but
because
when
you're
learning
in
school,
you
follow
the
instructions
of
the
teacher.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
w-
sa-
say
again
why
you
you
think
the
vernonia
situation,
with
respect
to
this
point,
is
different
than
the
tecumseh.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
i-
questions
been
battered
b-
batted
back
and
forth
that
comment...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
y-
i
you're
y-
you're
you're
not
saying,
are
you,
that
unless
the
school
has
the
sort
of
discipline
problem
they
had
in
vernonia,
it
can't
do
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rationale
with
golfers
in
vernonia?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
vernonia
was
based
on
a
safety...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
its
testing
included
golfers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ex-
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
boyd
ms.
meoli,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
chief
justice
rehnquist
