mr.
graham
a.
boyd
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
opposing
counsel
said
we
have
to
draw
the
line
somewhere,
and
the
way
the
way
to
draw
the
line
in
this
case
is
to
keep
in
mind
the
core
principle
that
individualized
reasonable
suspicion
is
the
standard
for
school
searches
set
forth
in
tlo.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
there
there
was
not,
and
vernonia
is...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
th-
vernonia
is
the
exception
to
the
tlo
rule.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
yes,
they
can.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
no,
there's
not,
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
throat
swabs
if
you
think
there's
a
contagious
disease.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well,
unless
the
court
stands
ready
to
overrule
tlo,
i
believe
it
is
the
standard.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
of
of
course.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
yes,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
competitions,
they
are.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
i
i-
i
i
honestly
don't
know
what
months
of
the
year
they
compete
in,
and
and...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
mhm.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well,
justice
kennedy,
you're
absolutely
right.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well,
there
there're
couple
of
things.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
justice
breyer,
i
i
think
you're
you're
right.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
sure.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
sure.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well,
i
i-
i
i
mean,
i
i
think
what's
perhaps
behind
your
question
is
a
little
bit
of
what's
the
law
and
why
is
the
law
that...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
okay,
fair
enough.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well,
it...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
let
let
me,
l-
l-
let
let
let
me
let
me
do
two
things,
if
i
may,
justice
scalia.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
a-
a-
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
not.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
right.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
justice
ginsburg,
there's
a
good
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
yes.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
in
lo-
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
[inaudible]
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
absolutely,
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
a-
y-
y-
you're
absolutely
right
about
that,
and
please
don't
hear
me
to
be
disparaging
of
those
other
tools
because
those
are
tools
that
do
not
include
a
blanket
intrusive
search,
which
is
the
principle
that's
at
issue
here.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
it
d-
it
does.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
that's
not
my...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
let
m-
let
me
please
try
to
be
more
clear
about
that.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well,
because
of
the
disruption
that
could
be
caused
by
the
sch-
by
the
school
paper
articles.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well,
and
and
also
the
form
issue.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
i
did.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
sure.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
mhm.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
no,
i'm
not.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
i'm
not
really
sure
that
one
can
can
r-
can
rank
more
and
less
constitutional.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
it's
not
enough
because
what
that
would
say
is
that
i-
i-
t-
it
is
really
that
the
balancing
test
behind
the
fourth
amendment
reasonableness
requirement
becomes
one
where
there's
no
weight
on
one
side
of
the
of
the
balance.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
right.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well,
it's
you
know,
the
number
is
probably,
according
to
mr.
clement,
is
more
like
fifty
percent,
and
and
that
fifty
percent
of
of
the
kids
in
the
high...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
and...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well,
if
it's
fifty
percent
nationally,
this
school
in
its
reports
to
the
federal
government
says
that
its
school
wide
drug
use
based
on
its
own
surveys,
which
is
where
the
national
data
comes
from,
surveys,
is
five
percent.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well
--
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
right,
he
he
did...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
okay.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
no,
they
could
not
because
there's
still
is
a
need
for
a
safety
rationale.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well,
the
the
safety
rationale
i-
i-
i
mean,
certainly
the
court
in
vernonia
didn't
talk
about
golfers
one
way
or...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well,
in
vernonia,
the
court
talked
at
some
length
about
the
safety
rationale.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
death
from
overdose
is
certainly
a...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
it
it
absolutely
is,
justice
scalia,
and
whe-
and...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
i
i
don't
mean
to,
and
where
there
is
evidence
of
drug
use
among
a
group
of
students,
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
it
is.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well,
i
think
if
we
listen
to
the
school
board
and
to
the
school
administration,
who
themselves
are
even
closer
to
that
problem,
what
they
say
is,
we've
identified
enough
of
a
problem
that
initially
we
want
to
test
our
athletes.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
[inaudible]
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
even
by
the
nature
of
that
hypothetical,
you're
it
it
presupposes
one
of
the
schools
is
going
to
be
vastly
inferior
on
a
number
of
grounds.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well,
i
i
think
n-
no
i
don't
think
that's
the
reason
why,
i...
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
well,
sh-
she
absolutely
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
i
i
think
uniforms
are
a
world
apart.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
i
i
think
the
answer
to
the
argument
is
the
fourth
amendment
turns
on
reasonableness.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
graham
a.
boyd
thank
you.
