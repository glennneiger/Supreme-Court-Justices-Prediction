the
e-
in
e-
n-
there
was
a
problem
with
athletes.
justice

well,
i'm...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
referring
specifically
to
page
one
hundred
and
one
hundred
and
one
of
the
joint
appendix
where
the
question
is
whether
the
students
who
tend
to
be
indevolved
[:
involved]
in
drugs
are
the
ones
most
likely
to
be
choosing
extracurricular
activities.
justice

where
is
that
testimony?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
had
no
basis
for
saying
yes
or
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
saying,
as
was
the
case
in
vernon-
vernonia,
that
here
is
a
group
that
we
can
identify
that
has
this
problem.

taking
elective
classes,
classes
that
the
state
doesn't
require
you
to
take,
but
some
students
might
like
to
take?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
line
that
you
would
draw
as
a
question
of
the
school's
policy,
but
you
were
saying
i-
at
least
you
see
a
problem
with
testing
everyone
because
people
are
compelled
to
go
to
school
and
so
th-
that's
why
you
resisted
drawing
the
line
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
doing
a
voluntary,
then
why
don't
you
say
as
well,
you
volunteer
for
you're
taking
a
certain
course,
this
is
elective
course.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
a
question
that
that
is
concern
concerns
me
about
the
difference
between
this
case
and
vernonia?
if
we
if
we
look
at
what
people
might
expect
in
the
real
world,
where
people
know
that
athletes,
professional
athletes,
olympic
athletes,
athletes
are
tested
for
drugs,
but
people
who
are
just
everyday
people
aren't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
made
in
vernonia,
and
it
does
go
across
the
board,
and
that
was
the
statement
that
drug
testing
on
suspicion,
which
is
the
alternative,
because
in
life,
it's
everything
as
compared
to
what.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
diverts
the
teachers...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
are
engaged
in
that
exercise
from
the
job
of
teaching
to
being
a
police
officer.
