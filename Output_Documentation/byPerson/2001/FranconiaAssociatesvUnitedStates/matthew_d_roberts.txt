mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
[ns]
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
we're
for...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
for
the
purposes
of
deciding
the
statute
of
limitations
question,
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
included
a
right
of
prepayment
and
not
only
a
right
of
prepayment,
because
if
the
contract
just
said
you
can
prepay
at
any
time,
it
like
all
contracts
would
be
presumed
to
be
subject
to
subsequent
legislation.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
two
things.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
yes,
your
honor,
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
contract
and
and
be
responsible
for
damages.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
doesn't
mean
that
that
doesn't
mean
that
it's
not
a
breach,
but
what
it
means
is
that
the
breach
is
occurring
at
the
time
the
legislation
is...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
what
what
we're
what
we're
asking
for
is
that
people
who
believe
that
their
contractual
rights
have
been
injured
have
been
infringed
by
a
statute
give
the
government
reasonably
prompt
notice,
in
accordance
with
the
statute
of
limitations,
of
their
claims.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
the
the
damages
are
that
petitioners
had
a
loan
that
they
allege
gave
them
a
an
unfettered
option
to
prepay
at
any
time.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
damages,
first
of
all,
can
be
measured,
as
i
said.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
with
with
due
respect,
your
honor,
i
d-
i
don't
think
that's
the
reason
why
the
law
gives
the
the
option
to
the
innocent
party.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
to
retract
h-
its
wrongful...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's
t-
not
an
option
here
because
the
statute
is
a
present
breach.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
promise
that's
that's
that's
at
issue
here,
i
think,
and
if
if
i
could
try
to
go
back
to...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
our
position
is
that
there
is
an
actual
breach
at
the
time
that
the
statute
is
passed,
and
it's
a
breach
of
of
the
promise
that
the
government
made
that
it
wouldn't
impose
additional
legal
restrictions
on
prepayment.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
performance
on
that
promise
is
due,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor,
because
s-
because
the
the
the
difference
is
between
legislation
and
the
and
the
role
that
legislation
has
under
background
principles
of
contract
law
and
other...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
the
distinction
your
honor
is
that
is
is
is
two
fold
that
legislation
changes
the
legal
rights
and
so
there
isn't
an...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
does
it
does
exactly
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
no,
your
honor,
there
might
be
a
right
to
f-
specific
performance
if
it
was
the
kind
of
contract
that
you
could
get
specific
performance,
but
we
would
submit
that
you
couldn't
get
specific
performance
once
the
government...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
by
law.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
what
it
does
is
show
that
there's
i-
there
there's
a
change
and
an
an
injury
right
at
the
time
that
the
legislation
is...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
it's
not
going
to
apply
in
a
private
context
because
there
isn't
going
to
be
a
breach
by
virtue
of
of
legislation
unless
there's
a
promise...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
the
laws
aren't
going
to...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
you
you...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
you...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
you
have
no
need
to
invent
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
y-
y-
you
have
no
need
to
to
have
that
additional
promise
in
the
private
contract
because
because
there
isn't
the
presumption.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
w-
it's
my
my
my
my
argument
is
not
that
this
is
an
anticipatory
breach.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
has
to
be
there
in
a
contract
with
the
government...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
that's
not
our
principal
submission.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
could
read
the
statute
that
w-
providing
first
accrues
to
mean
that
the
first
that
when
a
plaintiff
can
first
bring
suit,
that
that's
when
the
statute
of
limitations
starts
to...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
given
the
principles
of
sovereign
immunity
and
the
principle
that
the
statute
should
be
narr-
narrowly...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
court
the
court
has
held
several
times
that
statutes
of
limitations,
as
conditions
on
the
government's
waiver
of
its
sovereign
immunity,
should
themselves
be
be
narrowly
construed
and
has
applied
it
in
in
in
cases,
for
instance,
involving
a
situation
where
a
private
party
claimed
that
the
limitations
period
didn't
run
until
an
administration
administrative
determination
had
been
made
that
there
wouldn't
be
that
there
was
a
lo-
w-
was
a
loss...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
the...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
government
ha-
can
do
that
and
has
done
it
here,
and
the
statute
of
limitations
provides
that
when
the
action
first
accrues,
there's
six
years
to
sue.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
and
if
if...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
in
the
in
the
ordinary
situation,
if
a
private
party
let's
let's
i-
if
if
i
may,
let's
c-
can
i
pose
a
hypothetical?
of
a
b-
if
if
a
if
a
private
party
had
promised
that
you
could
prepay,
that
the
other
party
could
prepay
at
any
time,
and
congress
passed
a
statute
that
imposed
restrictions
on
prepayment,
that
statute
would
be
neither
an
anticipatory
repudiation
or
a
breach,
but
would
provide
a
discharge.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that's
an
issue...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
on
on
the...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
okay.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
okay.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
w-
when
when
there's
a
present
when
there's
a
breach,
the
the
general
principle
is
the
statute
of
limitations
starts
to
run
at
the
time
of
the
breach.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
se-
sus-
there's
a
a
very
strong
interest
in
permitting
the
government
to
in
permitting
congress
to
decide
it
wants
to
wrap
up
the
costs
of
improvident
federal...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
wi-
the
th-
the
government
doesn't
know
who's
going
to
sue,
for
one.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i-
there's
a
dispute
here
as
to
whether
the
contract
made
this
promise
or
not,
and
the
government
doesn't
doesn't
know
how
that
dispute's
going
to
be
resolved.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
when
they
breach
a
contract
and
it's
a
breach,
the
the
statute
of
limits
does
start
to
run
and
the
rule
is
that
even
if
the
damages
can't
be
fully
ascertained,
that
that
the
statute
of
limitations
run.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
even
under
the
scenario
you
posed
that
that
there
wasn't
an
incentive
to
prepay
right
at
the
moment,
there's
still
a
a
change
in
what
i-
in
in
in
the
loan
that
petitioners
have,
and
it's
a
loan
where
they
no
longer
have
that
option
to
prepay...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
ye-
ye-
ye-
yes,
your
honor,
but
petitioners
here
aren't
complaining
about
the
fact
that
they're
ultimately
not
able
to
prepay.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
ther-
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
some...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
have
made
requests
to
prepay.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
some
have
but...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
at
that
point,
there's
an
exacerbation
in
our
view
of
the
of
the
previous
breach
because
it's
an
application
of
the
restrictions
that
were
imposed
and
that
were
imposed,
according
to
petitioners'
allegations,
in
violation
of
the
government's
promise
not
to
impose
them.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
at
the
time
of
the...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
suppose
that
the
government
could
could
do
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
reason
why...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
an
immediate
breach,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's
an...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
you
would
y-
y-
i-
it's
i
do
i
have
something
that's
that...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
think
that
the
c-
that
the
case
i
i
don't
have
a
case
one
way
or
the
other...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
but...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
if
you
didn't
make
any
pro-
any
other
promise
at
all,
it
would
be
an
anticipatory
breach.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
but
you
wouldn't
have
need
to
make
that
other
promise
because
the
because
it
would
be
presumed
that
you
wouldn't
take
action
that
would
d-
d-
you
wouldn't
be
excused
by
taking
action
that
makes
it
impossible
for
you
to
perform.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
all
i
can
say
to
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
that
there
are
many
situations
in
which
damages
cannot
be
ascertained
fully.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
i
don't
think
it
discourages
them,
your
honor,
because
they
they
can
sue
and
their
damages
are
measurable,
and
they
can
get
the
damages.
