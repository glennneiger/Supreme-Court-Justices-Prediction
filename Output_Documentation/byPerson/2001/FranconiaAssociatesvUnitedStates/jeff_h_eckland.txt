mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
we
are
justice
scalia,
we
are
seeking
compensation
for
the
breach
of
contra-
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
very
much
so,
your
honor.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
under
the
takings
claim,
justice...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
oh,
quite
so,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
it
is
with
the
department
of
agriculture,
your
honor,
through
the...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
well,
it
c-
it
comes
no.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
well,
petitioners
pled,
justice
souter,
the
takings
claim
in
the
alternative
to
the
breach
of
contract
claim.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
what's
being
taken,
justice
souter,
is
the
expected
use
of
the
petitioners'
properties.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
but
there
were
representations
by
the
government
that
created
a
reasonable
investment
backed
expectation
on...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
because
of
the
w-
one
judge,
in
particular,
because
of
the
unmistakability
doctrine.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
the
contract
was
not
clear
enough
to
constitute
an
enforceable
contract
with
the
government.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
your
honor.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
on
the
basis
of
the
statute...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
well,
in
yes.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
we
do
not
either,
your
honor,
although
the
petitioners
here
have
the
option
of
suing
assuming
suing
before
the
breach,
assuming
that
they
had
the
ability
to
perform
at
that
time
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
no,
judge.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
yeah.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
y-
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
yes,
but
only
if
they
had
the
ability
to
prepay
at
that
time.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
and
able,
judge.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
you
do
have
to
show
that
you're
but
for
the
repudiation,
you
do
have
to
show
that
you
are
able
to
perform.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
essentially
so,
your...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
don't
rely
on...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
well,
no.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
but,
your
honor,
if
the
person
who
had
the
obligation
to
accept
the
the
delivery
did
not
have
the
funds,
for
example,
even
to
purchase
them,
then
that
would
be
sort
of...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
j-
certainly,
justice
souter,
the...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
correct,
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
and
and
the
doctrine
does
not
require
you
to
sue
until
that
date.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
yes,
your...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
because
the
government
negotiated
option
terms
up
to
fifty...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
deal,
and
the
owners
relied
on
that
when
they
signed
up,
and
they
had,
you
know,
a
clear
expectation
that
at
some
point
in
time
they
would
be
able
to
prepay,
opt
out,
and
convert
their...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
market
rate
yes.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
n-
well,
the
right
still
existed,
your
honor,
but
it
wasn't
it
was
repudiated
at
the
time
of
the
statute.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
the
statute
did
condition
them,
and
that
conditioning,
or
fettering
as
the
government
says,
is
a
repudiation,
but
like
any
other
situation
in
the
private
sector,
when
you
repudiate
a
right,
the
breach
doesn't
occur
until
the
time
for
performance
comes
due.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
correct.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
seventy-nine
they
initially
conditioned
the
right,
and
in
nineteen
eighty
they
repealed
it,
retracted
it.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
we
believe
it
can
be
a
repudiation,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
in
our
case,
no.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
very...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
petitioners
here,
being
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
have
as
their
only
remedy
the
monetary
judgment.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
we're
saying
th-
the
petitioners
would
at
least
have
to
have
the
money
to
prepay.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
intent
to
perform
and
have
the...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
to
perform,
f-
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
mhm.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
but
here,
justice
kennedy,
a
fifty
year
option
exists.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
well,
but
even
so,
even
if
you
could
come
up
with
a
damage
theory
to
cover
this,
still
it's
clear
that
under
the
law,
the
breach
would
not
be
deemed
to
accrue
for
limitations
purposes
until
the
time
for
performance
has
arrived
and
performance
failed.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
if
they're
able
to...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
w-
well,
justice
o'connor,
no.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
according
to
corbin
and
the
case
law
that
we
cite
at
footnote
twenty-three
of
our
brief,
yes.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
yeah...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
in
general,
yes,
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
from
the
statute,
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
but
the
all
petitioners
commence
suit
within
six
years
of
the
date
of
the
actual
breach,
which
is
the
date
that
the
prepayment
requests
were
denied.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
technically...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
well,
here
your
honor,
although,
yes,
we
need
to
construe
the
statute
strictly,
we
cannot
do
so
in
such
a
manner,
however,
to
narrow
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
has
already
occurred
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
it
it
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
they
sued.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
justice...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
well,
your
your
honor,
no.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
well,
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
well,
in
the
event
that
the
lower
courts
do
not
rule
in
the
petitioners'
favor
on
the
contract
claim,
they
have
their
wholly
independent
takings
claim,
which
is
based
not
it's
not
predicated
on
the
existence
of
a
contract.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
buildings
and
their
land.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
well,
there
are
differences
between
the
claims,
your
honor.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
petitioners
do,
your
honor,
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
yes,
because
damages
are
different.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
if
well
in
practical
terms,
justice
scalia,
if
we
do
prevail
on
the
contract
claim
at
trial,
i
don't
see
that
we
would
pursue
the
takings.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
on
behalf
of
petitioners
i
mean,
we
would
not...
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
yes,
you
do.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
prior
to
the
time
that
the
owners
entered
into
this
program,
they
owned
their
land.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
then
they
voluntarily
agreed
to
these
restrictions
on
the
use,
only
a
certain
level
of
rent,
only
a
certain
income
of
tenants.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
if
there
is
no
contract
right,
then
no,
that
was
not
taken,
your
honor.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
their
w-
is
is
the
is
the
permitted
use
of
the
property
under
their
reasonable
invex-
investment
backed
expectation.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
which
occurred
prior
to
the
time
that
they
voluntarily
agreed
to
participate
in
the
program.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
well,
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
at
or
about
the
same
time.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
it's
just
their
inability
to
go
back
to
using
their
proper-
they
the
w-
the
way
they
were
because
of
the
passage
of
elihpa
and
the
regulations
that
compelled
them
to
continue
charging
only
a
certain
level
of
rent.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
yes.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
the
construction
loan,
your
honor,
in
many
cases
was
in-
was
initially
from
a
private
mortgage
lender.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
yes.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
the
prepayment
right
itself
was
in
the
promissory
note,
yes,
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
mr.
chief
justice
i
see
that
most
of
my
time
is
spent.
mr.
jeff
h.
eckland
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
