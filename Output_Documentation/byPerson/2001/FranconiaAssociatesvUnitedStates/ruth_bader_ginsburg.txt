justice

this
case
presents
a
question
of
time,
specifically
the
time
within
which
suit
must
be
commenced
when
congress
passes
a
statute
renouncing
the
government’s
contractual
undertaking
to
carryout
a
promise
in
the
future.
the
time
allowed
pursued
on
contracts
with
the
government
is
six
years.
the
issue
is
when
does
that
time
begin
to
run?
petitioners
are
property
owners
who
participated
in
a
federal
program
designed
to
provide
affordable
rental
housing
in
rural
areas.
petitioners
gained
low
interest
mortgage
loans
from
the
government
and
in
exchange,
they
agreed
to
devote
their
properties
to
low
and
middle
income
housing
and
to
abide
by
related
restrictions
during
the
life
of
the
loans.
petitioners
alleged
that
the
promissory
notes
governing
their
loans
guaranteed
them
the
right
to
prepay
at
any
time
and
thereby
gain
early
release
from
the
property
use
restrictions
of
the
federal
program.
in
the
suits
that
yielded
the
judgments
before
us,
petitioners
charged
that
congress
abridged
that
release
right
in
the
emergency
low
income
housing
preservation
act,
the
acronym
is
elihpa,
that
act
placed
permanent
restraints
on
prepayment
of
program
loans.
petitioners
complained
that
in
so
altering
the
terms
of
the
bargain,
congress
repudiated
petitioner’s
loan
contracts.
the
federal
circuit
held
petitioner’s
claims
time
barred.
passage
of
elihpa
that
court
ruled
immediately
and
totally
breached
petitioner’s
loan
agreement,
and
therefore,
triggered
the
running
of
the
six-year
limitation
period.
petitioners
filed
suit
not
within
six
years
of
but
over
nine
years
after
elihpa’s
enactment.
hence,
the
federal
circuit
concluded
that
claims
were
untimely
and
their
suits
were
properly
dismissed.
we
accept
for
purposes
of
this
decision
as
the
government
that
the
loan
contracts
guarantee
the
absolute
prepayment
right
that
petitioners
alleged.
we
disagree
with
the
federal
circuit’s
determination
and
reverse
that
court’s
judgment.
elihpa’s
enactment,
we
conclude,
qualified
as
a
repudiation
of
the
parties'
bargain
but
not
a
present
breach
of
the
loan
agreements.
accordingly,
breach
would
occur
and
the
six-year
limitations
period
will
begin
to
run
when
a
borrower
seeks
to
prepay
and
the
government
then
disnonors
its
obligation
to
accept
the
payment
and
release
control
over
use
of
the
property
that
secured
the
loan.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
