please
that
after
the
enactment
of
the

your
c-
clients
could
have
filed
suit
for
breach
of
contract
on
an
anticipatory
breach
theory?
justice
sandra

o'connor
you're
you're
just
getting
me
confused
again.
justice
sandra

o'connor
no.

in

there's
also
a

justice
sandra

o'connor
why
aren't
weren't
you
satisfied
with
a
breach
of
contract
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
are
you
adding
with
this
so
called
takings
claim?
justice
sandra

o'connor
to
dismiss
it
too,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra

you

can
we...

and
was

justice
sandra

o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra

o'connor
do
you
concede
or
should
we
take
this
case
on
the

do
do
we...

justice
sandra

o'connor
it's
so
hard
to
look
at
this
as
an
actual
breach
if
we
take
it

there
was

to
assure

that
there

there
was
a

prepay

it's
been

should
want

rules
out
there
that
would
encourage
it

be
able

deal

people
on
a
commercial
basis
in
some
areas.
