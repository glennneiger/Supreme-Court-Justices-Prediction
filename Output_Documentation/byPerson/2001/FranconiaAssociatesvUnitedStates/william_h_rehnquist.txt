we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
oh
one
four
fifty
five,
the
franconia
associates
versus
united
states,
and
the
grass
valley
terrace
versus
united
states.

eckland.
mr.
chief...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ye-
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
presented
is
whether
a
breach
of
contract
claim
accrues
for
purposes
of
section
twenty-fi-
when
congress
enacts
a
statute
alleged
to
abridge
a
contractual
right
to
freedom
from
regulatory
cavants
[:
covenants]
upon
prepayment
of
govern-
mortgage
loans.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
the
case
we
have
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
federal
circuit
rely
on
anticipatory
breach?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
argu-
about
is
whether
a
statute
itself,
without
any
ac-
action
from
the
agency,
can
be
a
repudiation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
twenty-three
just
says
that
ordinary
contract
law
applies
to
these
this
kind
of
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
still
do-
but
we
so
we
still
have
to
figure
out
what
ordinary
contract
law,
footnote
twenty-three
doesn't
shed
any
light
on
that
that
i
saw.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
the
property
being...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
w-
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
is
an
option,
why
should
the
par-
innocent
party
be
penalized
by
having
the
sta-
statute
of
limitations
start
to
run
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
performance
is
not
yet
due.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
the
proposition
that
the
y-
and
an
anticipatory
breach
not
accepted
by
the
other
party
starts
the
statute
of
limitations
rim-
running?
i
mean,
what
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
it's
a
present
breach?
do
you
still
say
that
an
anticipatory
breach
starts
the
statute
running?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
the
law
as
between
private
parties.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
contract
law
is
not
appried
[:
applied]
you
know,
you
know,
you
could
say
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
general
contract
law,
it's
important
that
people
who
breach
contracts
know
as
soon
as
possible
how
much
damage
they've
done,
but
obviously
that
doctrine
has
not
commended
itself
in
the
area
of
general
contract
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
eckland.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-455
franconia
associates
versus
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
