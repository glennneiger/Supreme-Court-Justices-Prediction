h.
souter
with
your
argument
is
that
if
you
have
your
whole
property
claim
here
rests
upon
the
contract.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
they
are
correct,
then
i
don't
see
how
you've
got
a
taking
because
your
your
whole
property
interest
the
only
property
interest
you're
asserting
is
an
interest
under
that
contract.

contract
for
it,
you
have
no
right
to
expect
it.
justice
david

me-

what
you're...

david

about
here
in
performance
means
w-
w-
the
ability
to
prepay.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
we...
justice
david
h.
souter
this?
could
we
agree
to
this,
that
so
far
as
the
element
of
an
anticipatory
breach
claim
involves
the
act
of
the
government,
you
had
that
element,
and
at
least
to
that
extent,
you
could
have
brought
an
anticipatory
breach
claim
when
the
statute
was
passed?
maybe
you
didn't
have
other
elements.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
but
you're
saying,
whether
i
could've
sued
then
or
not,
i
certainly
can
sue
at
the
point
at
which
i
would
claim
my
right
to
redeem
without
these
various
conditions,
and
they
refused
to
honor
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
to
any
contract
that
is
ever
made.
justice
david
h.
souter
principle
of
contract
law
is
that
we
try
to
treat
the
government
and
a
private
contracting
party
together.
justice
david
h.
souter
saying
the
fact
that
the
government
can
speak
through
legislation,
whereas
a
private
party
cannot,
alters
that
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
contract
it
exists?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
convert
one
right
into
a
a
a
right
to
damages
as
opposed
to
a
right
to
performance
but
the
theory
of
contract
is
that
by
repudiation
you
can't
just
change
the
legal
rights.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
exactly
the
same
thing
is
true
in
a
private
contract
when
there
has
been
an
anticipatory...
justice
david
h.
souter
let's...
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
that...
justice
david
h.
souter
back
to
the
original
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
roberts,
in
the
case
in
which
the
government,
we'll
assume,
doesn't
change
its
mind,
your
argument
in
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
question
seems
to
boil
down
to
something
like
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
because
of
the
government's
peculiar
power
to
pass
legislation,
the
government
should
not
be
in
the
position
of
the
usual
contract
breaker
who
may
be
subject
to
an
anticipatory
breach
claim
or
an
actual
breach
claim
later.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
we
let
congress
survey
through
the
departments
of
the
government
how
many
contracts
it
has
entered
into
or
guaranteed
and
taught
up
the
damages
in
advance?
the
government
has
access
to
this
information
if
it
wants
to
get
it.
justice

the
government
may
get
off
