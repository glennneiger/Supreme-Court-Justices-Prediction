justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
have
a
a
right
to
assume
right
after
the
day
after
the
statute
was
passed,
did
they
continue
to
have
a
right
to
prepay,
justice
john
paul
stevens
objection?
y-
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
wasn't
just
repudi-
it's
not
like
a
private
citizen
saying,
i
don't
intend
to
perform
three
years
from
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maintain
there
was
no
breach
at
the
time
the
law
was
passed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
statute
changed
the
--
your
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
change
his
mind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
because
i
i
have
to
confess,
i
get
getting
a
little
confused,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
we
got
before
us
the
takings
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
they...
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
well
would
you
tell
me
what
you
think
was
taken?
is
it
the
right
to
prepay
that
was
taken?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
regulatory
taking
of
the
right
to
make
use
of
the
property
the
way
you
wanted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
before
even
before
they
signed
the
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ask
the
question...
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
you
never
made
a
contract
claim.
