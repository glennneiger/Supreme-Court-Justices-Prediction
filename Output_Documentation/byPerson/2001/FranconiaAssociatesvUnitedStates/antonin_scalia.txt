mr.
eckland,
you
you
began
by
saying
you're
seeking
fair
compensation
for
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
you
have
a
separate
cause
of
action
for
the
government's
violation
of
the
constitution,
assuming
y-
that
that
that
you're
correct
that
that's
what
it's
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
not
the
takings.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
lower
courts
find
that
there
was
no
contract
claim?
because
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
no,
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
to...
justice
antonin
scalia
when
when
the
obligation
to
perform
comes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
i
have
a
contract
to
deliver
a
hundred
thousand
widgets
three
years
from
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
anticipatory
breach
most
people
use
it
not
to
get
damages
but
to
relieve
themselves
of
the
obligation
of
of
remaining
i-
i-
in
in
the
status
of
being
able
to
perform
the
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
never
the
case
that
he's
ready
to
or
almost
never
the
case
that
he's
ready
here
and
now
to
perform.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
funds
until
three
years
from
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
deal.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
change
its
mind?
couldn't
the
government
pass
another
statute
going
back
to
what
ze
[:
the]
justice
antonin
scalia
was
before
this
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
did
it
at
one...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
usually
the
case,
is
it
not,
that
when
there's
an
anticipatory
repudiation,
it's
v-
it's
very
difficult
for
the
the
other
party
to
determine
what
his
damages
are
going
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
why
he
uses
the
doctrine
to
get
out
of
the
contract
rather
than
to
seek
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
had
the
ability
to
pay,
you
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
i-
if
that's
the
ca-
i
me-
i
mean
i
really
do
think
that
your
takings
claim,
w-
w-
which
is
the
reason
you're
going
into
this
thing
well,
it
was
just
a
conditioning
of
the
right
it
wasn't
an
elimination
of
the
right
it
just
reduced
it
you
you
do
all
of
that
to
to
support
your
takings
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
you
can
say
it
was
enough
for
an
anticipatory
breach,
but
it
wasn't
enough
for
a
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
that's
why
you
were
confusing
justice
o'connor,
justice
antonin
scalia
not
really
ready
to
say
there
was
an
anticipatory
breach,
because
in
order
s-
to
sustain
your
takings
claim,
you
don't
really
want
to
say
there
was
an
anticipatory
breach
because
they
didn't
really,
absolutely
break
the
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
both
shoulders
it
seems
to
me,
and
and
and
you're
spilling
a
lot.
justice
antonin
scalia
full
benefit
of
your
contract,
which
is
what
would
happen
if
you
win
on
your
contract's
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
cannot
cannot
break
a
contract
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
government
can
always
act
by
legislation,
can't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
it
does
it
by
legislation,
it's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
thought
that
was
your
point,
that
that
this
m-
this
breach
is
different
because
it
was
done
by
legislation.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
measure?
y-
you
you
bet
your
life
on
that?
i
mean,
the
the
reason
the
reason
contract
law
has
developed
the
option
of
suing
for
anticipatory
breach
as
just
an
option
is
precisely
because
it
is
often
so
difficult
to
anticipate
what
your
damages
will
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
mean,
you
know,
my
life
expectancy
can
be
measured,
but
i
wouldn't
bet
a
whole
lot
of
money
on
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
come
up
with
a
guess
for
for
for
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
bingo,
there
is
a
breach
of
contract
and
you
must
sue
at
once.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
longer
have
the
option.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
whole
case
hines
[:
hinges]
on
that,
that
the...
justice
antonin
scalia
really
different
because
of
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
rule
for
it
would
that
make
you...
