stephen
g.
breyer
the
notion
that
before
they
went
to
pay
it
off,
it
was
an
anticipatory
breach.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
confused.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
your
argument...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
the
reason
the
statute
of
limitations
doesn't
arise,
doesn't
start
to
run
prior
to
the
time
that
they
paid
it
off,
is
because
prior
to
that
time,
there
was
no
actual
breach.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ginsburg
was
asking...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
what
apparently
the
government's
arguing
does
it
matter
if
we
call
this
anticipatory
repudiation
or
anticipatory
breach?
i
guess
technically...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
should
say
anticipatory
rebudiation?
[:
repudiation]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
what
they
say,
in
part,
which
i'd
like
hear
your
response,
is
that
you're
right
that
where
there
is
anticipatory
repudiation
of
a
contract,
the
other
side,
if
it's
a
private
contract,
has
a
choice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
win
on
the
contract
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there're
differences.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
[inaudible]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
fine...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
asking
us
to
do
then
is
to
write
a
little
essay
on
a
matter
that
affects
millions
of
other
people
in
a
very
serious
way,
in
a
case
which
doesn't
seem
completely
to
present
the
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
my
contract
to
pay
a
million
dollars
when
my
ship
when
the
ships
with
grain
come
in,
i
say,
a
year
in
advance,
ha
ha,
i'll
never
pay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
curious
to
get
into
that
a
little
bit
is,
i
don't
understand
why
the
government
is
taking
the
position
it
does,
as
well
as
what
the
position
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
understand
your
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
that
the
in
government
contracts,
there
is
a
promise
and
there
is
an
issue
whether
the
government
means
that
promise
irrespective
of
what
congress
does
in
the...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
an
issue...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
the
government
meant
was
irrespective
of
what
congress
does,
and
you're
saying
no,
it
meant
only
if
congress
doesn't
do
to
the
contrary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
kind
of
a
contract
issue
is
breached
when
congress
passes
the
law
to
the
con-
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
just
a
background
principle,
i
would
worry
about
the
practical
consequence
being
of
people,
particularly
in
real
estate
contracts,
having
to
study
every
regulation,
every
statute
in
order
to
tell
their
clients
what
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
may
not
know
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
immediate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that's
pretty...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
analogous
to
the...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
an
anticipatory
breach...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mhm.
