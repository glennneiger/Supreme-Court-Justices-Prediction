justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
irca
itself
enacted
a
provision
making
it
illegal
for
aliens
to
provide
false
documentation
to
get
employment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
irca
add
provisions
and
impose
obligations
on
prospective
employers
to
require
them
to
review
the
documents
and
make
sure
that
they
appear
to
be
regular
on
their
face?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
was
a
new
provision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
there
any
allegation
in
this
case
that
the
employer
failed
to
comply
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
doing
though,
really
is
kind
of
odd,
because
the
the
result
is
that
back
pay
awards
to
illegal
workers
are
likely
to
be
greater
than
to
legal
ones
under
this
board's
policy,
and
that's
so
odd,
and
it
gives
the
illegal
alien
an
incentive
to
try
to
phony
up
more
documents
and
to
extend
for
the
longest
possible
time
the
charade
that
the
worker
is
here
lawfully,
and
that's
that's
surely
strongly
against
the
policies
of
the
immigration
act
at
the
very
least.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
be
looked
at
after
the
fact,
let's
find
out
who
violated
what
and
then
fashion
the
appropriate
remedy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
here's
the
thing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
an
incentive,
it
seems
to
me,
for
the
employee
to
continue
to
conceal
the
facts,
the
facts
that
he's
here
illegally
and
has
no
right
to
work,
and
that
the
documents
are
false,
and
the
board's
rule
fosters
both
those...
