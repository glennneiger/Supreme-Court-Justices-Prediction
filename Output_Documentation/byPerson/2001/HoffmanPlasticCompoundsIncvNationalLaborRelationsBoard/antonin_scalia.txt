justice
antonin
scalia
conditioned
it
on
legal
presence,
i
mean,
in
fact
they
were
not
present.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
dictum.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
but
but
it
only
had
to
say
one
condition
in
order
to
decide
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
went
on
to
say,
and
in
addition
you
have
to
be
available
t-
to
work,
but
but
that
was
really
unnecessary
to
the
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
would-
wouldn't
it
also
be
the
case
that
that
if
the
employer,
by
reason
of
this
inducement,
hired
su-
supposed
inducement
hired
somebody
whom
he
knew
at
the
time
of
the
hiring
to
be
an
unlawful,
an
illegal
alien,
even
applying
the
board's
rule,
he
wouldn't
have
to
pay
any
back
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
the
board
fine
can
the
board
fine
the
employer?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
else
can
the
board
do
to
punish
the
employer
for
for
the
unfair
labor...
justice
antonin
scalia
sanction,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
really
don't
have
any
explanation
for
that
for
that
language
.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
i
suppose
your
explanation
is
that
that's
as
much
dictum
as
as
as
your
your
opponent
says
sure-tan
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
question
i
was
going
to
ask
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
what
now
i
i...
justice
antonin
scalia
green
card
is,
but
is
the
is
the
working
and
getting
pay
unlawful
under
the
immigration
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
has
to
pay
for
the
sweat,
though,
doesn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i-
if,
indeed,
the
worker,
u-
u-
under
this
scheme
you're
proposing,
there's
no
doubt
that
if
the
document
i-
undocumented
alien
works,
he's
going
to
get
paid
for
the
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
complaint,
if
it
were
if
it
were
complete,
should
should
read
something
like,
you
know,
i
shouldn't
have
been
working
at
all,
and
it
was
illegal
for
me
to
be
working
at
all,
and
i'm
complaining
because
i
only
got
twelve
thousand
dollars
in
illegal
illegal
wages.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
administrative
agencies
as
to
what
damages
are
available
in
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wolfson
before
you
get
to
the
substance
of
the
matter
i
i
want
to
ask
a
question
sort
of
relates
to
something
that
justice
stevens
asked
stevens
asked.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
when
when
it
was
told
that
that
it
want
that
that
you're
you're
going
to
argue
that
courts
should
pay
illegal
aliens
money
that
it
was
unlawful
for
them
to
earn?
what
what
did
the
ins
say
to
that?
breath>
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
if
i-
if
they
agreed
with
it,
i
mean,
and
just
thought...
justice
antonin
scalia
i-
i
have
no
i
it
explains
why
we
have
a
massive
problem
of
illegal
immigration,
if
that's
if
that's
how
the
ins
feels
about
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
history
was
that?
i...
justice
antonin
scalia
was
this
a
really
powerful
portion
of...
justice
antonin
scalia
both...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
house?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
that
aliens
who
had
no
right
to
be
here,
had
no
right
to
be
earning
any
money...
justice
antonin
scalia
should
should
get
paid
for
periods
that
they
didn't
work?
it
it's
not
a
matter
of
their
having
worked
and
and
and
provided
the
employer
with
with
a
benefit,
which
you're
then
reimbursing
them
for,
but
they
haven't
worked.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
it's
unlawful
for
them...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
in
in
most
back
pay
situations
where
the
employer
has
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
dismisses
an
employee
improperly,
the
amount
he's
going
to
be
stuck
with
for
back
pay
is
limited
by
the
fact
that
the
person
unlawfully
fired
has
to
mitigate.
justice
antonin
scalia
mitigation
is
quite
impossible,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
unlawfully
obtains
another
job,
justice
antonin
scalia
deducted?
justice
antonin
scalia
need
not
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
he'd
say,
how
can
i
mitigate,
it's
unlawful
for
me
to
get
another
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
home
and
eat
chocolates
and
get
my
back
pay...
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
back
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
even
i
thought
i
thought
that
the
rule
was,
as
soon
as
the
employer
knows
of
the
illegality
we're
not
going
to
allow
any
back
pay
from
then
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
knows
about
illegality
from
the
very
beginning,
then
we
will...
justice
antonin
scalia
order
back
pay?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
initial
hiring
up...
justice
antonin
scalia
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
prosecution
for
viola-
if
if
they
know
that
it's
it's
an
illegal...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
have
thought,
i
would
have
thought
mr.
wolfson,
that
when
you
said,
you
know,
there
are
seven
million
illegal
aliens
in
this
country,
that
what
you
would
follow
that
with
is
not,
that's
an
awful
lot
of
people
not
to
give
back
pay
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
you
don't
want
to
do
to
reduce
it
is
to
give
them
back
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
on-
once
you
adopt
that
rule,
however,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
asserted
benefit
to
the
immigration
laws
that
you're
claiming
this
rule
has
disappears.
justice
antonin
scalia
trying
to
deter
the
employer
who
hires
an
immigrant
apparently
with
with
this
in
the
back
of
his
mind,
i
know
this
guy's
an
immigrant
and
i
can
commit
an
im-
unfair
labor
practice
upon
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you
just
agreed
to
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
souter
does
contradict
the
the
the
immigration
i
i
i
remember
when
this
statute
was
passed
about
what
the
responsibility
of
the
employer
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
more
than
what
the
statute
requires.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wolfson,
do
do
you
think
a
state
court
could
enforce
a
contract
for
employment
by
an
illegal
alien?
justice
antonin
scalia
contract
with
an
employer
then
it
it
is
he
sues
because
the
employer
doesn't
go
ahead
with
it,
and
and
could
a
state
court
say,
well,
you
made
the
contract,
you
should
be
liable
for
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
doctrine
that
that
contracts
in
violation
of
the
law
are
unenforceable?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
all
of
that
is
for
work
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
injury
suffered,
not
to
enforce
a
contract
which
has
not
been
executed,
which
is
what's
going
on
here.
