laws
changed
at
all
in
any
re-
relevant
respects
since
our
decision
in

chief

william

and
how
how
w-
what
what
relevant
changes
did
irca
make?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
goes
back
as
far
as
southern
steamship
company,
where
you're
talking
about
the
mutiny
statute,
that
the
board
can't
just
go
ahead
without
any
reference
to
competing
statutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mccortney.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
exactly
right,
that's
what
a
legislative...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
include
the
national
labor...
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
d-
does
the
does
the
board
have
to
reconcile
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
office
of
contract
compliance?
i
would
think
that
it's
responsibility
as
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
immigration
act
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
comes
down
on
both
sides,
and
it
it
makes
certain
acts
by
illegal
immigrants
illegal,
the
even
the
entry
and
it
makes
certain
acts
by
the
employer
illegal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
why
should
the
board
be
responsible
for
making
sure
that
the
employer
documents
his
material
about
illegal
aliens?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
clearly
you
haven't
missed
your
opportunity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
the
board
take
over
responsibility
for
those
provisions
that
are
basically
immigration
law
provisions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolfson.
chief

william

i
have
the
opinion
of
the

to

no.
00-1595,
hoffman
plastic
compounds
versus
the
national
labor
relations
board.
petitioner
hoffman
plastic
compounds
hired
jose
castro
after
castro
tendered
documents
appearing
to
verify
his
authorization
to
work
in
the
united
states.
petitioner
later
fired
castro
and
other
employees
after
they
supported
a
union-organizing
campaign
at
petitioner’s
plan.
the
board
found
these
layoffs
to
violate
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
ordered
hoffman
to
award
backpay
to
castro
and
other
workers.
at
a
hearing
to
determine
the
amount
of
backpay
to
be
awarded,
castro
testified
that
he
was
an
illegal
alien
and
that
he
fraudulently
gained
employment
with
petitioner
by
tendering
a
birth
certificate
that
was
not
his
own.
the
board
nonetheless
ordered
petitioner
to
pay
castro
$66,000
in
backpay
plus
interest.
the
court
of
appeals
enforced
the
board’s
orders
in
an
opinion
filed
with
clerk
of
the
court
of
today,
we
reversed.
we
have
consistently
set
aside
the
board’s
backpay
awards
to
employees
found
guilty
of
serious
illegal
conduct
in
connection
with
their
employment
that
is
precisely
the
situation
here.
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
1986
expressly
prohibit
the
employment
of
illegal
aliens
in
the
united
states.
this
statute
among
other
things
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
for
any
illegal
alien
to
gain
employment
by
tendering
false
or
fraudulent
document.
there
is
no
dispute
that
castro’s
use
of
a
false
birth
certificate
to
gain
employment
with
petitioner
violated
this
criminal
provision.
to
award
him
backpay
moreover
would
require
that
he
violate
other
provisions
of
the
immigration
laws.
the
board
admits
that
castro
qualifies
his
backpay
only
so
long
as
he
remains
inside
the
united
states.
but
castro
can
only
remain
the
united
states
illegally.
the
board
further
admits
that
castro
has
a
duty
to
mitigate
his
damages
by
seeking
new
employment
but
castro
can
only
seek
new
employment
illegally.
in
light
of
these
factors,
we
need
not
defer
to
the
board’s
remedial
authority
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
deference
is
inappropriate
where
the
board
chooses
a
remedy
that
trenches
upon
federal
statutes
or
policies
outside
the
board’s
competence
to
administer,
such
as
those
relating
to
the
federal
immigration
laws.
we
have
recognized
in
previous
cases
that
the
provisions
of
irca
violated
here
our
central
to
federal
immigration
policy.
therefore,
however
broad
the
board’s
discretion
to
fashion
remedy
is
when
dealing
only
with
a
national
labor
relations
act,
it
is
simply
not
so
vagrant
and
unbounded
as
to
it
authorized
this
sort
of
an
award.
justice
brerye
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter,
and
ginsburg
join.
