your
position
would
apply
if
this
were
a
violation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
instead
of
the
m-
labor
act?
if
the
employer
had
underpaid
the
employee,
would
he
have
a
right
to
legal
back
pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
two
different
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
position
is
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
could
just
supplement
that,
don-
do
we
owe
any
deference
to
the
views
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
who
is
responsible
for
enforcing
these
a-
both
statutes?
