if
that
is
so,
then
why
did
the
court
make
the
comment
on
page
nine
oh
one
of
the
opinion
in
footnote
eleven,
talking
about
the
board
has
said
that
it's
it
will
make
it
this
arbitrary
number
of
weeks,
and
the
court
said
the
board
has
never
intemp-
attem-
attempted
to
impose
a
minimum
back
pay
award
that
the
employer
must
pay
regardless
of
the
actual
evidence
as
to
such
issues
as
the
employee's
availability
to
work
th-
all
of
that
would
have
been
unnecessary
if
it
were
just
this
blanket
rule,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
they
it
it
was
a
crime
to
do
any
work?
why
i-
if
if
you're
s-
sticking
with
your
theory
that
everything
that
this
person
did
on
that
job,
from
presenting
the
false
documentation
on,
was
unlawful,
so
why
should
he
be
paid
anything
for
unlawful
activity?
you're
making
a
distinction
between
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
nlra,
but
your
theory,
i
think,
would
cover
both.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
title
seven?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
the
allegation
is,
they
kept
me
in
this
entry-level
job,
although
i
was
qualified
for
the
next
steps,
because
i
was
a
woman
and
they
never
promote
women.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
make
it
just
like
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
about
back
pay
for
title
seven.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
in
title
seven,
if
she
were
laid
off,
say,
because
they
laid
off
all
the
women
before
they
la-
laid
off
any
men,
so
sh-
she
would
also
have
a
duty
to
mitigate
in
those
circumstances,
would
the
result
be
different?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
just
told
me
that
you
would
bracket
the
title
seven
with
the
flsa.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
board
did
take
that
into
account,
though.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
go
back
to
one
thing
it
also
said
in
sure-tan,
which
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
made
an
estimate
without
any
evidence
as
to
the
period
of
time
these
employees
might
have
continued
working
before
apprehension
by
the
ins,
and
that
sounds
working
before
apprehension
by
the
ins,
that
sounds
very
close
to
what
the
board
did
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then,
th-
what
what
do
you
make
of
the
the
condition
about
the
period
between
the
violation
and
when
the
employees
might
have
continued
working
before
apprehension
by
the
ins?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
outcome
of
that
particular
case,
where
they
were
in
mexico,
but
a
case
where
they
were
here,
and
the
question
was,
how
much
back
pay,
and
there's
a
reference
to
not
a
flat
six
weeks
or
six
months
or
whatever,
but
the
time
period
from
the
unlawful
employment
practice
until
one
would
expect
the
ins
would
pick
up
these
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
cases
we're
only
talking
about
a
situation
where
the
employer,
and
presumably
the
union,
too,
doesn't
know,
because
if
if
the
employer
knows,
then
the
employer's
obligation
is
to
dismiss
that
person,
as
i
assume
it
would
be
the
union's,
too,
but
in
all
these
cases
the
issue
comes
up
only
because
the
employer
didn't
know
of
the
illegality,
isn't
that
so?
