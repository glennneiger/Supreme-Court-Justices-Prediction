and
and
is
it
correct
that
when
sure-tan
was
argued,
aricka
[:
irca]
if
that's
the
way
you
pronounce
it,
was
being
considered
by
congress
and
the
government
in
its
argument
told
us
that
if
aricka
[:
irca]
had
been
passed,
back
pay
would
not
be
available?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
if
the
opinion
in
sure-tan
we
think
equivocal,
if
it's
a
wash
either
way,
what
what
is
your
principal
argument
for
reversal
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i-
it's
i-
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
furthermore,
just
from
the
standpoint
of
equity,
i
suppose
the
employer
has
benefitted
from
the
services
in
in
in
the
case
that
justice
ginsburg
puts,
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
benefit
here
save,
arguably,
from
the
from
illegal
lab-
labor
practice,
but
there's
there's
no
benefit
for
work
received.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
i
understand
that
if
the
employer
and
the
employee
both
know
of
the
illegality,
that
then
there's
no
back
pay?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
that's
absolutely
upside
down.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
and
of
course,
you
don't
this
is
the
government's
position,
you
don't
have
to
defend
it,
but
in
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
the
government
says
once
the
employer
knows
that
there's
a
violation
and
continues
it,
then
he's
no
longer
liable
for
back
pay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
an
osha
violation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
makes
makes
its
calculus
and
when
the
government
made
its
calculus,
did
it
give
any
consideration
to
the
fact
that
a
union
ought
not
as
a
matter
of
policy
to
use
illegal
aliens
for
organizing
activity,
or
do
you
think
the
union
can
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
consistent
with
the
labor
laws
of
the
united
states
for
the
union
say
it
knowingly
uses
an
alien
for
organizing
activity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
doe-
that
doesn't
d-
in-
induce
illegal
immigration?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
far
more
direct
link
than
the
very
tenuous
idea
that
you
have
that
there's
going
to
be
more
illegal
immigration
because
they
know
they're
going
to
get
back
pay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
they're
ill
if
they're
illegal
employees?
i'm
baffled
by
that.
