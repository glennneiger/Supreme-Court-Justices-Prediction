mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
justice
scalia,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
the
position
in
our
brief
has
been
developed
in
consultation
with
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
ins
has
agreed
with
it
and
accepts
it,
and
i'm...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
have
i
i
must
disagree
with
that,
justice
scalia,
and
the
point
is,
as
the
board
recognized
both
in
this
decision
and
in
the
apra
fuel
decision
which
preceded
it,
the
essential
problem
is
that
there
is,
as
the
board
pointed
out,
an
inseverable
connection
between
illegal
immigration,
the
availability
of
jobs,
and
poor
working
conditions
for
employees
for
i-
that
illegal
immigrants
are
wiling
to
take
in
the
united
states.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that
is
that
is
exactly
right,
so...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
legislative
history
says.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
committee
house
judiciary
committee
and
the
education
and
labor
committee,
but
i...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
of
the
house.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
it
is
important
also
to
note
that
in
irca
congress
also
wrote
into
law
authorization
of
increased
resources
for
enforcement
of
of
federal
labor
laws
by
the
department
of
labor
by
the
wage
and
hour
division
and
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it
did
not
refer
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
but
the
point
is,
congress
knew
that
the
department
of
labor
sh-
was
enforcing
and
should
enforce
federal
labor
laws
at
the
behest
of
and
for
the
benefit
of
illegal
aliens
to
obtain
back
pay
for
them.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it
it's
n-
it
it
is
it
does
not
just
periods
for
which
they
have
worked,
which
might
arguably
distinguish
the
fair
labor...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
minimum
you
know,
maximum
hours
and
minimum
wage.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
routinely
seeks
back
pay
for
alien
for
aliens
and
others
who
have
been
terminated
in
violation
of
executive
orders
.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
even
though
it
is.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
funda-
a
a...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
fundamental
part
of
the
feder-
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i-
i-
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that
exactly,
justice...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
w-
here's
a
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
unlaw-
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
undocumented
alien
has
a
duty
to
mitigate.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
i
i
will
agree
with
that.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
quite...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes,
and
that
is
quite...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
don't
agree
that
the
board
would
have
to
accept
such
a
representation.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
not
benefit
from
the
fact
that
he
is
an
undocumented
alien
and
being
relieved
of
and
getting
more
back
pay
than
the
similarly
situated
authorized
worker.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
but
the
board
did
look
to
irca
and
the
court
can
look
to
irca,
which
includes
these
other
provisions
in
the
department
of
labor,
to
determine
what
congress
was
attempting
to
achieve
in
irca,
and
those
are,
i
think,
reasonable
indicators
of
what
congress'
objectives
were
and
how
far
it
intended
to
go
along
with
the
legislative...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
i
don't
know
that
the
board
has
addressed
the
point
of
knowingly
using
illegal
aliens.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
i
don't
know
i
would
suggest
that
the
the
more
powerful
inducement
towards
illegal
migration
is
the
availability
of
the
job,
union
or
no.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
in
this
case
the
employer
did
not
know.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
does
order
back
pay
up
to
the
point
where
up
to
the
point
where
either
the
employee
is
reinstated,
or
it
terminates
at
a
reasonable
i-
if
the
employee
fails
to
put
himself
in
compliance
with
the
immigration
laws
and
become
qualified,
the
board
cuts
off
back
pay
as
of
that
as
of
the
end
of
a
reasonable
period.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
that
is
because
in
a
case
like
this,
what
the
what
the
board
is
doing
is
affording
the
employer
the
benefit
of
its
general,
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
in...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes,
because
in
a
situation
like
that
the
employee
the
employer
is
not
well-situated
to
claim
the
benefit
of
the
after-acquired
evidence
rule,
because
it
cannot
claim
that
it
wouldn't
have
hired
the
alien...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
law
here,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
the
board
is
the
board
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
of
developing
a
workable
implementation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
pursuant
to
its
authority
under
section
ten
c.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
the
problem,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
the
immigration
act,
the
policies
come
down
on
both
sides.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
board
is
attempting
to
fashion
the
board
doesn't
know
in
advance
which
employer
will
violate
the
law
by
hiring
undocumented
aliens
knowingly
and
which
will
not,
or
which
employer
will,
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that
the
that
the
rule
the
board
isn't
is
fashioning
a
rule
that
is
implementing
congress'
policy...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
the
court
has
not
said
that
the
board
has
to
only
fashion
its
remedies
in
a
case
in
which
the
precise
situation
in
the
pr-
e-
i-
you
know
in
the
precise
situation
into
which
it's
it's
dedicated.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it's
not
just
the
problem
of
their
knowing
of
their
knowing
that
they're
illegal
hiring.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
i
don't
think
that
it's
not
that
the
board
is
implementing
irca,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
but
one
does
have
to
take
into
account
i
think
what
would
be
the
consequence
of
an
opposite
rule.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
because
it
well,
because
the
labor
laws
benefit
everybody,
and
it's
not
just
i
mean,
they
are
when
i
say
they're
organizing
a
bargaining
unit,
obviously
there
are
there
may
be
in
this
case
there
were
other
citizens
and
authorized
aliens
who
are
interested
in
organizing
for
the
purpose
of
vindicating
their
rights
under
section
seven
of
the
labor
relations
act.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
now,
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
a
serious
problem
of
illegal
immigration,
and
the
ins
and
the
attorney
general
dedicate
substantial
resources
to
attempting
to
resolve
that
problem.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
board
has
limited
its
it
certainly
hasn't
limited
its
remedy
to
that
situation...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
w-
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
court
has
to
decide
that
case
here.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
justice
bergam,
[:
breyer]
my
point
is
that
the
board
in
a
case
like
the
board
did
rely
on
its
apra
fuel
decision
in
this
case,
but
what
it
it
held
in
this
case
was
that
an
employer,
once
an
employer
learns
that
an
alien
is
undocumented
and
therefore
he
cannot
be
hired,
and
in
addition
that
the
board
accepts
that
that
employer
would
not
have
would
not
have
hired
that
alien
and
would
have
discharged
the
alien
when
it
found
out
that
he
was
undocumented,
then
the
employer
should
surely
get
the
benefit
of
the
after-acquired
evidence
rule
that
is
applied
in
m-
many,
many
kinds
of
federal
labor
laws,
including
the
age
discrimination
act,
for
example.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
whether
or
not
he
may
not
know
in
the
face
of
having
clear,
irrefutable
evidence
before
him.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
that
of
course,
that's
not...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
at
at
a
m-
i
i
would
say
at
a
minimum
that
is
the...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
the
board
does
not
view
itself
as
enforcing
the
immigration
laws.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the-
they
don't
have
any
liability
under
irca.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
i
do
want
to
i
do
want
to
touch
a
bit
on
sure-tan,
which
i
haven't
had
much
of
a
chance
to
discuss.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
do
not
think
that
a
state
court...
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
i
think
a
state
court
could
award
damages,
and
state
courts
have
done
so.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
th-
they're
not
necessarily
completely
void.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
there
may
perhaps
there
is
a
difference
between
tort
and
contract
damages,
but
it
is
not
just
for
work
done.
