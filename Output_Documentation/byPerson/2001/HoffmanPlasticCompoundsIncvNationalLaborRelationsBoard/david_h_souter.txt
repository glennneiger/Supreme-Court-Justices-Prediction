justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
do
you
what
do
you
say
of
the
the
argument
that
the
board
makes
that
even
even
if
the
the
the
the
dictum
in
in
sure-tan
were
a
were
a
a
holding
as
as
you
say
it
it
should
be
treated,
that
the
statute
has
changed
the
landscape,
and
that
the
board's
rule
in
effect
is
is
in
aid
of
the
statute,
because
the
board
is
saying
the
illegality
on
the
part
of
the
employer
comes
when
the
employer
knowingly
employs
these
people
despite
knowledge
of
of
their
illegal
character,
so
in
effect
we're
going
to
say
that
the
obligation
to
pay
back
pay
stops
when
the
employer
knows
that
the
alien
in
fact
is
illegally
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
i
think
i
think
you're
right,
but
the
board
is
saying,
yeah,
there's
that
inducement
on
one
side,
but
there's
a
very
powerful
employer
inducement
if
we
come
out
the
other
way,
and
although
i
don't
think
the
board
put
it
in
these
words,
i
take
it
the
board
is
saying,
we
think
the
employers
are
going
to
make
a
rational
decision
about
inducements
more
clearly
or
more
obviously
than
employees,
the
illegal
aliens
might
do,
so
we're
going
to
prefer
the
the
inducement
or
the
policy
that
is
going
to
have
the
strongest
effect
on
the
employers.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
board
is
saying
we
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
have
any
doubt
that
there
are
other
ways
for
us
to
distinguish
this,
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
if
this
were
an
original
matter
with
us
we
wouldn't
have
sort
of
struck
the
balance
where
the
board
did,
but
you've
got
the
element
here,
the
added
element
here
of
of
the
board's
decision,
and
i
suppose
we
owe
some
kind
of
respect
to
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
were
there
agency
adjudications
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
and
and
the
result
of
which
was?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
there
was
an
administrative
order
to
pay,
wasn't
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
th-
fu-
the
but
the
board
did.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
wolfson
the
ar-
if
every
time--
and
i
i
understand
that
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
another
way
to
describe
the
class
that
you're
dealing
with
is,
he
may
not
know
in
the
sense
that
the
government
can
prove...
justice
david
h.
souter
he
knew,
but
there
is
a
class
of
employers
as
to
whom
the
evidence
is
not
clear,
and
it
is
that
class
that
we
want
to
provide
the
negative
inducement
for.
