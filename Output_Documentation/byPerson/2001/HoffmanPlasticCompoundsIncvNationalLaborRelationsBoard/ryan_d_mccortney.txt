mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
award
of
back
pay
to
an
undocumented
alien
who
never
was
legally
present
or
legally
authorized
to
work
in
this
country
conflicts
with
this
court's
holding
in
sure-tan
or
with
this
country's
immigration
laws
and
policies.
in
sure-tan,
this
court
held
that
the
discriminatees
in
that
case
must
be
deemed
unavailable
for
work
and
the
accrual
of
back
pay
therefore
tolled
during
any
period
when
they
were
not
lawfully
entitled
to
be
present
and
employed
in
the
united
states.
the
sure-tan
court's
back
pay
limitation
is
consistent
with
the
ina's
dual
requirement
that
to
be
employed
in
this
country
an
alien
must
be
both
legally
present
and
legally
authorized
to
work.
despite
this
dual
requirement,
the
board
contends
that
castro
is
entitled
to
back
pay
even
though
he
never
was
legally
present
or
legally
authorized
to
work
in
this
country
during
the
back
pay
period.
the
fatal
flaw
in
the
board's
position
lies
in
its
adherence
to
its
physical
availability
doctrine.
the
board
contends
that
this
c-
court
denied
back
pay
to
the
discriminatees
in
sure-tan
only
because
they
had
left
the
country
and
were
physically
unavailable
for
work.
if
the
board
is
right,
the
sure-tan
discriminatees
could
have
illegally
reentered
the
country
to
establish
physical
presence
and
to
commence
the
accrual
of
back
pay.
however,
such
reentry
would
violate
the
immigration
laws
of
this
country
and
be
contrary
to
this
court's
holding
in
sure-tan.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
yes,
your
honor,
the
passage
of
irca
in
nineteen
eighty-six.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
irca
was
an
amendment
to
the
ina
that
made
the
employment,
the
knowing
employment
of
un-
undocumented
aliens
unauthorized
from
the
employer's
perspective.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
well,
your
honor,
i
i
would
i
would
not
call
it
dicta
only
because
the
court
set
forth
the
conditions
upon
which
the
discriminatees
might
receive
back
pay,
if
any,
if
they
were
to
legally
reenter...
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
well,
the
threshold
condition
was
legal
reentry,
and
that
was
the
starting
point
of
the
analysis.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
footnote
eleven
what
the
court
was
addressing
was
the
minimum
back
pay
award
of
six
months
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
imposed
and
the
board
had
adopted,
and
then
the
board
tried
to
defend
that
award
by
arguing
that
they
had
in
other
cases
had
estimates
of
back
pay,
despite
the
fact
that
the
discriminatee
was
unable
est-
unable
to
establish
with
any
certainty
the
probable
length
of
the
back
pay
period.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
assuming
that
sure-tan
is
equivocal?
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
that
the
board's
award
of
back
pay
conflicts
with
the
immigration
laws
and
policies
of
this
country
as
embodied
in
the
ina
and
irca.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
your
honor,
the
just
the
mere
prospect
of
receiving
back
pay
in
this
case
encouraged
castro
to
extend
his
illegal
stay
by
more
than
four
years
and
to
continue...
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
y-
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
those
ind-
the
the
deterrence
of
the
employer
to
that
knowingly
hires
illegal
aliens
or
employs
them,
that
awarding
back
pay
is
necessary
in
light
of
the
the
sanctions
under
irca
that
now
subject
employers
that
do
so
to
civil
and
criminal
sanctions,
and
so...
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
your
honor,
what
it
doesn't
address
is
the
violation
of
the
ina.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
your
honor,
i
think
what
the
sentent-
sentence
means,
at
least
my
reading
of
it,
is
that
retrospective
sanctions
may
be
imposed,
but
not
necessarily,
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
and
desist
order,
as
in
this
case,
with
the
threat
of
contempt
sanctions.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
yes.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
all
i
would
say,
your
honor,
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
it
still
doesn't
address,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
the
illegal
presence
and
the
use
of
fraudulent
documents
and
working
without
authorization
is
a
violation
of
the
ina.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
yes,
it
is.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
that
was
a
new
provision.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
your
honor,
i
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
states
they
seem
to
equate
back
pay
under
the
nlra
with
back
pay
under
the
flsa
when
they're
two
different
things.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
no,
we
would
not
advocate
at
all,
and
we
have
not,
taking
wages
away
from
undocumented
aliens
that
have
been
earned
for
work
already
performed.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
well,
your
honor,
we
give
certain
rights
and
benefits
to
undocumented
aliens
that
are
already
in
this
country,
and
we
do
that
to
level
the
playing
field
between
undocumented
aliens
and
american
workers
so
that
unscrupulous
employers
won't
prefer
undocumented
aliens
over
american
workers.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
that's
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
sure.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
well,
your...
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
well,
your
honor,
that's
the
problem
with
the
rule,
is
that
it
in
some
ways
rewards
the
unscrupulous
employer
in
sure-tan
and
penalizes
the
innocent
pl-
employer,
as
in
hoffman.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
absolutely,
your
honor,
no
doubt,
and
we
have...
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
could
be.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
under
title
seven,
i-
th-
if
it's
back
pay
exactly
like
back
pay
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
where
it's
unearned
wages
for
work
not
performed
during
the
back
pay
period,
then
that
would
be
a...
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
if
it
were
discovered
that
that
the
u-
illegal
that
this
person
was
an
illegal
alien...
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
available
under
title
seven
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
and
to
enforce
compliance.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
it
would
be
bracketed
if
in
your
situation,
you
would
get
back
pay,
and
let
me
explain
the
difference
in
this
case.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
no.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
i
yes,
because
i
notwithstanding
justice
scalia's
very
good
example
that
i
don't
find
that
appealing,
that
there
is
a
way
that
this
court
can
distinguish
between
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
is
remedial
in
nature,
and
all
these
other
state
and
federal
discrimination
laws
that
have
punitive
features
to
it
that
are
not
dependent
on
the
undocumented
alien's
ability
to
work
in
this
country.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
in
what
way,
your
honor?
there
was...
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
back
pay
hearing,
there
was
a
underlying
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
that
the
employer
was
found
to
have
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
yes.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
law
judge
did
find
that
did
not
award
any
back
pay
to
castro
because
it
conflicted
with
sure-tan
had
found
that
it
conflicted
with
irca.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
yes.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
i
i
would
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
and
this
in
sure-tan
this
court
said
in
devising
remedies
for
unfair
labor
practices
the
board
is
obliged
to
take
into
account
another
equally
important
congressional
objective,
to
wit,
the
objective
of
deterring
unauthorized
immigration
that
is
embodied
in
the
ina.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
well,
your
honor,
i
would
agree,
if
if
the
board's
remedy
conflicts
with
the
policies
of
another
statutory
scheme,
then
it
it's
they're
owed
no
deference.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
the
apra
fuel
case?
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
okay.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
well,
your
honor,
also
in
sure-tan,
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
remedial
section
of
the
opinion
it
states,
by
directing
the
board
to
impose
a
minimum
back
pay
award
without
regard
to
the
employee's
actual
economic
losses
or
legal
availability
to
work,
the
court
of
appeals
plainly
exceeded
its
limited
authority
under
the
act.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
i
your
honor,
i
don't
know,
because
the
discriminatees
in
that
case
were
left
the
country
the
same
day...
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
your
honor,
again
i
think
that
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
other
language
in
the
sure-tan
decision
which
is
repeated
over
and
over
again
about
legal
availability
to
work,
and
being
legally
authorized
to
work,
and
why
would
the
court
use
that
language
if
it
didn't
have
to?
so
i
getting
back
to
the
policy
of
this
that
underlies
the
immigration
laws
of
this
country,
is
to
preserve
jobs
for
american
workers.
mr.
ryan
d.
mccortney
thank
you,
your
honor.
