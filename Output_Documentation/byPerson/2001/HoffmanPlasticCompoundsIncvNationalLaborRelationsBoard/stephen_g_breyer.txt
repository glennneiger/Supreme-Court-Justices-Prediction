what
i-
what
is
th-
here
i
i
think
justice
souter
is
we
said
in
our
cases
just
what
justice
souter
said,
i
take
it,
ins
v
lopez-mendoza,
you
know
quoting
what
sure-tan
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't,
what
would?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
that
sure-tan
was
dealing
with
a
case
where
the
employer
did
know
in
respect
to
the
sanction
that
the
employee,
the
alien,
was
illegal
so
sure-tan
did
not
consider
the
kind
of
sanction
here
at
issue,
which
is
a
sanction
that
applies
only
to
the
period
where
the
employer
did
not
know
that
the
employee
was
an
illegal,
hence
the
employer
was
not
violating
the
immigration
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
difference
is,
the
of
course,
that
if
the
employer
knowingly
hires
this
alien,
he's
subject
to
a
lot
of
other
penalties
under
the
immigration
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who,
you
know,
all
he
does,
he
says,
i've
checked
their
cards,
i've
checked
their
cards,
the
cards
say
they're
here
legally,
and
he
runs
some
god-awful
sweatshop.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
pretty
low
cost,
because
he's
violating
every
labor
law
under
the
sun.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
he
i
guess
you're
quite
right
that
if
the
if
the
board's
award
violates
the
immigration
law,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
that
the
immigration
law
doesn't
forbid
that
award
in
terms,
but
its
policy
would,
in
fact,
be
hindered,
while
the
labor
law,
actually
the
policy
is
furthered,
though
it
doesn't
insist
on
this
kind
of
award,
wouldn't
we
defer
to
the
board
when
it
seeks
to
reconcile,
or
the
attorney
general
when
they
seek
to
reconcile
the
policies
of
the
two
statutes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
irca
didn't
the
legisla-
history
of
the
report
say
that
irca
is
not
meant
to
undermine
or
diminish
in
any
way
labor
protections
in
existing
law,
or
to
limit
the
powers
of
labor
relations
board
to
remedy
unfair
practices
committed
against
undocumented
employees?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
in
the
question--
because
i
have
exactly
the
same
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
souter
said
i
had
taken
to
be
the
precise
rationale
for
the
narrow
set
of
cases
we're
supposed
to
to
d-
decide.
