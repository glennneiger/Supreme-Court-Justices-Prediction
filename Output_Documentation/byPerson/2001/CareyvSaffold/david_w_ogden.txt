mr.
david
w.
ogden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
go
directly
to
the
two
most
difficult
questions
that
i
need
to
answer
this
morning
and
which
have
been
addressed
extensively
thus
far.
first,
that
the
rule
adopted
by
the...
by
the
unanimous
courts
of
appeals
that
any
gaps
between
stages
of
the
state
habeas
process
should
be
tolled
so
long
as
the
next
stage
is
initiated
in
a
timely
fashion
should
apply
to
california.
and
second--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--and...
and
the
second
point
that
i'd
like
to
address
is
that
under
that
rule
on
the
record
in
this
case,
there
is
an
insufficient
basis
to
conclude
that
the
filing
in
the
state
supreme
court
was
late
and
therefore
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
yes,
your
honor.
that's
the
first...
that's...
that's
the
first
subject
that
i'd
like
to
cover
because
i
know
that
one
of
the
concerns
and
one
of
the
difficulties
of
this
case
is
applying
the
concepts
of
the
statute
to
california's
unique
system.
now,
california's
system
of
original
writ
should
be
subject
to
the
rule
that
tolls
the
entire
period
of
time
for
two
reasons.
first,
that
is
the
best
understanding
of
the
text
of
the
statute
because
california's
system--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--of
aedpa,
your
honor,
of...
of
section
2244(d)(2).
because
california's
system
functions
as
an
integrated
appellate
style
process
for
prisoners
seeking
to
exhaust
state
remedies.
and
second,
because
just
as
in
other
states,
the
so-called
gap
theory
espoused
by
the
state
would
discourage
prisoners
from
making
full
use
of
california's
process
and
encourage
premature
federal
filings.
now,
turning
to
the
text
of
the
statute...
and
justice
scalia
asked
about
the...
about
the
word
application
in
particular...
congress
wrote
a
statute
in
general
terms
intended
to
apply
nationwide.
it
does
not
turn
on
the
particular
form
of
pleading
or
the
nature
of
the
action.
to
the
contrary,
an
application
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
simply
a
request
for
relief
so
long
as
it
is
submitted
in
the
context
of,
as
the
statute
phrases
it,
state
post-conviction
or
other
collateral
review.
now,
that
request
for
relief
is
distinct
from
the
claims
that
support
it,
and
it
is
pending
so
long
as
it...
as
it
is
unresolved
in
the
state
system.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
the
claims
are
the
arguments
that
support
the
request
for
relief
in...
in
a
habeas
or
post-conviction
context.
typically
the
request
is
to
be
released
from
an
unconstitutional
confinement.
that
request
is
supported
by...
by
a
set
of
claims.
and...
and
it's
the
request
that
constitutes
the
application.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
my
argument
is
entirely
consistent
with
artuz.
indeed,
it's...
it's
really
based
on
the
reasoning
there.
artuz
makes
a
distinction
between
bars
that
go
to
claims
and
bars
that
go
to
the
form
of
the...
of
the
application
itself.
my
submission
is
that
the
application
is
the
request
for
relief,
that
is,
regardless
of
what
form
it
takes
and
what
kind
of
proceeding,
it
is
a
request
that
contains
claims
in
the
same
way
that
an
application
contains
claims.
a
request
is
an
application.
and
that
request,
the
request
for
relief,
continues
to
be
pending
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
until
the...
until
it
is
resolved
within
the
state
system.
now,
in
the
california
system,
that
request
for
relief,
that
request
to
be
released
from
confinement,
continues
to
be
unresolved
so
long
as
there
is
another
court
to
which
one
can
bring
a...
a
petition
to
review
a
decision.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
yes,
your
honor,
you
could
present
different
claims.
but
the
way
the
california
system
functions
is
that
the...
the
design
of
it
where
factual
development
is
required,
quite
naturally,
is
that
that
claim
should
be
brought
in
the
superior
court.
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
if
you
attempt
to
file
an
original
petition
initially
in
a
higher
court
and
factual
development
is
required,
typically
if
it's
a
non-capital
case,
what
that
court
will
do
is
to
issue
an
order
to
show
cause,
returnable
in
the
superior
court.
and
once
you
are
there
as
a...
as
a
petitioner,
if
you
lose,
your
only
recourse
for
further
review
is
to
file
an
original
petition
yet
again
above.
now,
critically
from
the
standpoint
of
understanding
whether
this
is
an
appellate
system
or
a
system
of
completely
independent
free-standing
applications,
it's
important
to
understand
that
when
one
goes
from
the
superior
court
where
one
develops
a
record,
your
honor,
to...
to
the
court
of
appeal,
that...
that
next
filing
is
not
considered
a
successive
petition
under
california
law.
it's
not
considered
a
second--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--it's
called
an
original
writ.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
successive
petition
is
a
procedural
bar
under
california
law,
which
if
you
bring
a
second
petition
that
contains
claims
that
could
have
been,
but
were
not,
contained
in
your
first
petition
or
that
contains
the
same
claims
as
were
contained
in
your
first
petition,
it's
dismissed
as
a
matter
of
procedural
law
in
california
as
a
successive
petition.
that
successive
petition
bar
does
not
apply--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--well...
well,
it's...
it
is
difficult
because
so
much
of
this
turns
on
california
law.
but--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--well,
what...
what
it
looks
like,
as
described
in
a
case
called
in
re
resendez,
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
is--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--19
p.
2d,
pacific
second,
1171.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
it's
2001,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
pacific
third,
1171
at
1184.
that...
that
case
makes
clear
in
discussing
the
situation
in
which
a
subsequent
original
writ
is
filed...
originally
filed
in
the
superior
court
and
you
have
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
superior
court.
it
is
then
filed
subsequently
in
the
court
of
appeal
and
then--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--a
petition
encompassing
the
same
claims
is
filed
in
the
court
of
appeal
and
then
again
in
the
supreme
court.
first
of
all,
the
record
is...
the
record
generally
forms
the
basis
for
that
review.
and
in
gardner
against
california
in
1969,
looking
at
this
very
system
for...
for
handling
habeas
petitions
on
original
writ,
this
court
decided
that
the
system
was
sufficiently
similar
to
an
appellate
process
that
a
habeas
petitioner
filing
an
original
writ
in
the
court
of
appeal
was
entitled
at
state
expense
to
a
transcript
of
the
proceeding
in
the...
in
the
superior
court
because
the
procedure
in
the
court
of
appeal
is
essentially
record
review.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
you
certainly
can
file
the
record
and
the
clerk
can
request
it.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
it's
required.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
i...
i
think
ordinarily
there...
the
record
consists
of
the
petition
and
the
decision
below.
but
if
there
is
a
hearing
where
witnesses
are
presented,
i
believe
it
is
ordinarily
done,
and
that's
why--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--that's--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
well,
i...
i
cite
for
the
proposition
that...
that
the
record
is
part
of
the...
the
process
in
the
court
of
appeal,
both
the
resendez
case--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--well--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--the
best
i
can
do,
your
honor,
is
to
refer
to
these
three
cases...
the
resendez
case,
the
california
supreme
court
decision
at...
which
i've
given
the
cite
for;
in
re
wright,
which
is
78
cal.
app.
3d
at
801
to
802;
people
against
singer,
which
is
226
cal.
app.
3d
at
32...
which
make
clear
that
the
process
of
reviewing
these
matters
coming
from
the
superior
court
where
there's
been
a
prior
petition
there
and
the
same
claims
are
brought
in
the
next
court
is
a
process
of
reviewing
the
record,
and
where
what
is
presented
are
findings
of
fact
by
the
superior
court
that
are
based
on
credibility
determinations,
great
weight
is
given
to
those
credibility
determinations
by
the
reviewing
court.
and...
and
that
is
the...
the
fundamental
functionality,
the
way
the
system
works.
it
can
be
used
in
other
ways
without
question.
a
petitioner
can
attempt
to
file,
you
know,
claims
at
a
higher
level.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
well,
no,
your
honor,
they're
not
permitted
to,
and
i
think
that's
a
very
important--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--this...
this
court's
decision
in
the
o'sullivan
case
has
been
applied
by
the
ninth
circuit
in...
in
the
case
called
james
against
giles,
which
states
that
it
is
a
requirement,
in
order
to
fully
exhaust
one's
state
remedies,
that
one
file
and
submit
one's
claims
to
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
well,
i--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--i
think
it
sheds
substantial
light
on
it,
your
honor,
because
as
was
made
clear
in
duncan
against
walker
by
this
court,
the
very
purpose
of
this
tolling
provision
is
to
facilitate
and
to,
indeed,
promote
the
full
and
complete
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
i
believe
the
appropriate
course
for
the
federal
court
in
that
situation--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--would
be
to
apply
this
court's
decision
in
o'sullivan
against
boerckel
and
deem
the
petition
to
be
unexhausted.
at
that
point,
the
petitioner
could
apply
to
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
because
simply
it's
unknowable.
you
asked
the
question
earlier
whether...
who
decides
whether
it's
a
reasonable
time
or
not,
and
i
think
it's
very
clear
the
design
of
the
statute
of...
of
2244(d)(2)
is
that
the
state
of
california
decides.
whether
something
continues
to
be
pending
in
exhaustion
law
is
a
question
of
whether
it
is
possible
whether
there
is
a...
an
available
procedure
under
state
law
to
raise
the
claim
to
a
higher
level.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
that
implicates
a...
a
circuit
split
that's
not
presented
in
this
case,
your
honor.
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
among
the
circuits
about
how
to
apply
the...
the
endpoint
of...
of
the
tolling
process.
in
the
majority
of
circuits,
tolling
terminates
at
the
point
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
file
a--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it's...
it
is
important
for
my
client
what
the
answer
to
that
question
is
because
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
this
morning
is
that
the
submission
to
the
california
supreme
court
was
not
late
under
california
law.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
i
think
the
most--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--i'm
sorry.
i
think
the
most
natural
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
the
majority
of
the
court's
view
which
is
that
it
continues
to
be
pending
until
it
is
too
late
to
file
a
submission,
and
then
the
opportunity
to
file...
if
you
file
for
leave
to
file
out
of
time,
that
would
then
resume
the
tolling
if
that
motion
were
granted.
in
california,
that--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--your
honor--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--i
think
those
problems
are
more
complicated
in
a
system
like
california's
or
north
carolina's
which
is
an
appellate
system
that
involves
an
unreasonable
delay
standard
than
they
are
in
a...
in
a
system
that
has
clear
time
lines.
and
california
and
north
carolina,
if
they
don't
like
the
way
it's
playing
out
under
their
provisions,
can
simply
create
time
lines--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--i...
i
believe
there
are
about
three
different
ways
that
you
can--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--my
submission
would
be
that
until
the
california
supreme
court
indicates
how
long
the
time
period
is
that...
that
he
would
have
had
to
file,
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
look
to
evidence
of
other
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
california
to
determine
what
is
an
acceptable
gap
in
the
process.
and
that's
why
in
this
case
the
evidence
is
absolutely
overwhelming
that
the
4-and-a-half-month
period
that
the
state
relies
on
simply
wasn't
the
basis
for
the
california
supreme
court's
decision.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
well,
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
he
did
not.
he
submitted
a
sworn
statement
to
that
effect
in
the
california
supreme
court
in
his
petition.
but
as
the
ninth
circuit
said,
there
are
two
possible
bases
for
the
lack
of
diligence
finding
in
the
record.
one
is
5
years
before
he
filed
his
initial
claim.
the
other
is
this
4-and-a-half-month
period
in
which
he
says
and
swears
that
he
did
not
receive
notice.
the...
when
you
look
at
the
record
of
the
minute
orders
that
have
been
entered
by
california
on
the
very
day
and
in
the
very
weeks...
the
california
supreme
court...
around
when
mr.
saffold's
case
was
dismissed,
you
see
that
cases...
for
example,
the
davis
case.
there
was
an
18-month
gap
between
the
decision
in
the
court
of
appeal
and
the
petition
in
the
california
supreme
court,
and
the
california
supreme
court
simply
denied
it,
which
under
the
ylst
standard,
looking
through,
goes
back
to
the
merits
determination
before.
no
lack
of
diligence,
no
untimeliness.
in
the
sampson
case,
over
9
months
had
elapsed
between
the
court
of
appeal
decision
and
the
supreme
court
decision.
again,
absolutely
no
indication
of
a
lack
of
diligence
or
untimeliness.
in
the
viegas
case,
over
7
months
elapsed
between
the
court
of
appeal
and
the
decision...
and
the
petition.
no
explanation
from
mr.
viegas,
as
there
wasn't
from
davis
and
nothing
meaningful
from
sampson
for
the
delay
again.
and
the
saenz
case
is
another.
so,
there
are
those
four--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--your
honor,
i
think
anything
is
possible
because,
as...
as
somebody
said,
we're
in
a
mind-reading
mode
here,
and
so
certainly
that's
possible.
and
i
can't
stand
here
and
tell
you
it
is
impossible
that
they
simply
acted
in
an...
in
an
irrational
and
inconsistent
fashion.
the
fact
is
while
mr.
saffold
submitted
a...
an
explanation
which,
at
least
on
the
surface,
has
some
appeal
to
it,
none
of
these
others
did,
and
yet
much
longer
periods
of
time--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--i
think
it's
somewhat
unclear
what
the
ninth
circuit's
basis
was,
your
honor.
i
concede
that.
to
the
extent
that
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
a...
a
ruling
on
the
merits
would
trump
a
clear
finding
by
the...
by
the
california
supreme
court
that
the
petition
to
it
was
untimely,
i
think
that
would
be
an...
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
the
statute.
that's
my
view.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
the
critical
question
would
be
whether
the
case
was
dismissed
based
on
the
gap
between
the
court
of
appeal
and
the
supreme
court
as
opposed
to
the...
the
portion
that
preceded
the
original
filing
in
the...
in
the
trial
court
which
obviously
could
not
make
the
case
stop
pending
once
it
began
to
pend.
but
i
believe
that
certification
would
not
fit
the
profile
in
california
for
certified
questions.
they...
they
certify
questions
of
law,
and
this
is...
this
is
an--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--11
courts
of
appeals
have
considered
that
issue
to
this
point,
your
honor,
and
all
11
have
adopted
the
view
that
the
entire
period
of
time
should
be
tolled.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
and
in
the
nino
case
previously,
but
no
other...
no
other...
none
of
the
other
cases
really
deal
with
that--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--that's
my
understanding.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
well,
i
think
the
general
description
is
fine
and
i
think
it's
true
that
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
considered
unreasonable
by
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
your
honor,
i
think
that
we...
it's...
while
we
don't
know,
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
this
record
would
lead
one
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
the
4-and-a-half
months.
when
we
have
four
other
cases,
two
of
them
decided
the
same
day,
one
of
them
decided--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--well,
north
carolina
has
an
undue
delay
standard.
massachusetts,
until
just
very
recently,
as
the
first
circuit
explained
in
the
curry
case
just
last
week,
previously
had
no
time
limit,
has
now
imposed
a
30-day
time
limit
presumably
to
deal
with
some
of
these
problems.
the
times
in
other
states
vary.
4-and-a-half
months
is...
is
somewhat
longer
than
the
certiorari
time
in
this
court,
but
it's
not
by
an
entire
order
of
magnitude.
and
the
point
is
that
the
california
supreme
court
routinely
seems
to
reach
the
merits
despite
this
period.
and
in
this
case
we
have
a
5-year
delay
staring
us
in
the
face
in
which
the
only
justification
offered
by
mr.
saffold
was
that
he
needed
to
hire
a
private
investigator
to...
essentially
to
interview
the
jurors.
the
magistrate
judge
in
this
case,
applying
the
due
diligence
standard
of
federal
law,
which
is
in
2244--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--the
federal
magistrate,
yes,
your
honor,
in...
in
this
case
applying
the
federal
due
diligence
standard.
mr.
saffold
suggested
that
the
time
should
be
tolled
for...
for
the
running
of
the
entire
period
because
he
had
not
discovered
these
claims.
and
the
federal
magistrate,
looking
at
it,
said,
well,
you
should
have
discovered
these
claims
long
before.
you
didn't
exercise
due
diligence.
i
think
looking
at
the
face...
at
the...
at
the
joint
appendix
at
38,
looking
at
the
face
of
the
application
mr.
saffold
submitted
to
the
california
supreme
court
where
he
attempts
to
justify
the
5
years
on
that
basis
and
notes,
with
respect
to
the
4-and-a-half
months,
that
he
only
received
notice
the
very
day
he
filed,
the
only
reasonable
interpretation
is
that
they
relied
on
the
5
years,
a
period
of
time
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
whether
review
in
the
supreme
court
was
unavailable.
and
therefore,
it
is...
it
is...
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
this
court
to
suppose
that...
that
the
period
was
the
4-and-a-half
months.
this
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
approach
to
questions
of...
of...
related
to
procedural
bars
that
this
court
adopted
and
modified
in
the
coleman
against
thompson
case
where...
where
an
underlying
state
decision
leaves
reason
to
question
whether
the
federal
bar
is
applicable,
this
court
has
gone
ahead
and
decided
the...
the
merits
of
the
federal
claim
because
it's
entirely
within
the
power
of
the
state,
the
state
of
california
or
in
the
coleman
v.
thompson
circumstance,
to
be
clear
about
the
fact
that
what
was
the
period
and
when
did
it
expire,
or
alternatively,
simply
like
most
states,
to
have
a
clear,
definable
period
of
time
in
which--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--the
magistrate
did
not
find
that
he
received
notice
earlier
than
he
says.
what
the
magistrate
said
was
that
he
should
have
been
more
diligent
in
calling
the
court
and
contacting
them
and
so
forth.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
he
indicated...
suggested
that
he
would
not--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
it
couldn't
be.
i'm
saying
it's
far
less
likely
that
it
was.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
no.
indeed,
the
ninth
circuit
left
open
the
question
of
equitable
tolling
which
depends
on
that...
on
that
fact.
and
furthermore,
again,
it
doesn't
go
to
whether
he
received
notice.
it's
simply
the
opinion
of
the
magistrate
that
he
should
have
called
the
court
or
sent
a
letter
to
the
court
or
done
something
within
that
4-and-a-half-month
period.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
i
believe
it's
30
days
in
california.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
well,
i
think
it's
a
very
hard
question
for
him
because
his...
his
gap
theory
taken
to
its
literal
extreme,
taken
to...
to
the
application
that
it
would...
that...
that
gaps
are
not
tolled,
even
in
a...
an
appeals
situation,
would
cause
that
entire
period
of
time
on
the
state's
clock
to
run.
mr.
david
w.
ogden
well,
that--
mr.
david
w.
ogden
--that
would...
that
would
undermine
the
so-called
gap
theory
in
every
state
but...
but
california
where
typically
you
do
have
appeals
on
both
sides.
in
california,
you
have
a
state
appeal
and
a
functional
appeal
on
the
petitioner's
side.
and
so,
the
argument
could
be
made...
i
think
it's
a
hyper-technical
argument.
i
think
it's
an
argument
that's
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
this
statute,
but
you
could
make
the
hyper-technical
argument
that
because
california
gives
unequal
rights
to
the
two
sides,
an
appeal
on
the
one
hand
and
a
functional
appeal
on
the
other,
we're
going
to
treat
the
functional
appeal
in
a
different
way
for
federal
purposes.
i
would
submit
there
is
no
way
that
congress
intended
to
take
a
functional
appeal
that
has
the
purpose
of...
of
presenting
claims
that
are
required
for
exhaustion
and
said,
we
want
to
treat
that
differently
because
it's
merely
a
functional
appeal,
not
a
real
appeal.
that
makes
no
sense.
all
of
the
reasons
why
tolling
should
apply
in
the
gaps
prescribed
by
the
state,
the
period
the
state
believes
is
appropriate
for
the
presentation
of
these
claims,
the
period
the
state
believes
prisoners
should
have
in
order
to
prepare
and
present
their
claims,
that
we're
not
going
to
toll
that,
the
consequence
of
that
will
be
that
petitioners
will
not
wait
for
the
transcript.
they
will
file
their...
their
motions
in
the...
in
the
court
of
appeal
without
transcripts.
they
will
not
develop
their
arguments
well,
and
then
those
arguments
will
finally
be
made
for
the
first
time
effectively
in
the
federal
court.
that
is
not
what
was
intended
by
the
statute.
