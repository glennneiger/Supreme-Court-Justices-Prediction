in
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
might
have
been--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
don't
know
whether
that
untimeliness
was
the
5
years
that
he
took
to
even
get
started.
there's
one
fact
question
here
that
may
make
the
rest
of
this
rather
abstract.
this
petitioner
says
that
he
never
got
notice
of
the...
of
the
intermediate
appellate
court's
decision
and
he...
when
he
did...
i
mean,
the
only
gap
here
that's
relevant
for
aedpa...
the
5
years
is
gone.
he
gets
that
free.
but
the
only
gap
we're
talking
about,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
4-and-a-half
months.
and
he
says,
as
to
that,
i
never
knew.
i
wrote
a
letter
and
finally
they
told
me,
and
within
3
days
after
i
got
notice,
i
filed
in
the
next
court.
so,
i
was
diligent
from
the
time
i
knew
of
that
decision.
there
is
no...
there's
been
no
determination
by
anybody
whether
that
4-and-a-half-month
interval
was
beyond
his
control.
i
mean,
you
recognize
that
there
would
be
an
exception
for
situations
beyond
his
control.
so,
how
do
we
determine
whether
there
was
any
lack
of
diligence
with
respect
to
that
4-and-a-half
months?
this
record
is
totally
blank
on
it.
justice
ruth

do
you
know
how
the
california
supreme
court
operates
generally
with
respect
to
petitions
of
this
kind,
post-conviction
petitions?
is
it
common
for
them
to
say
on
the
merits,
but
anyway
it's
untimely,
or
do
they
often
say
it's
untimely,
that's
the
end
of
it
without
going
on
to
the
merits?
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
ogden--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
is
that?
it
seems
to
me
the
record
is
a
blank
on
that,
and
with
all
this
talk,
if
you
don't
count
those
4-and-a-half
months,
he's
timely
no...
no
matter
whether
it's
discrete
applications.
so,
what
do
we
do?
he
says,
i
never
got
that
notice.
and
it's
not
established
in
the
record
whether
he
did
or
he
didn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
wasn't
reviewed
by
the
ninth
circuit.
