justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
looking
at
how
federal
law--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
an
appeal?
i
thought
that
what
happened...
i
guess
i'm
mixed
up.
maybe
go
back
to
justice
o'connor.
but
i
thought
i
understood
this.
i
thought
that
they...
but
that
there
is...
first
of
all,
you
file
in
the
district
court
normally.
you
don't
have
to
in
california.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
almost
always
they'll
go
to
the
superior
court
and
file
a
petition.
and
then
in
every
other
state,
the
losing
party
would
appeal,
but
in
california,
they
use
different
words.
the
words
are
not
you
appeal;
the
words
are
you
file
a
new
petition
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
indeed,
if
you
lose
there,
the
words
are
not
you
have
10
days
to
seek
review
in
the
supreme
court;
the
words
are
you
have
whatever
time
you
want.
you
have
to
file
a
new
petition
in
the
supreme
court,
but
if
you're
too
late,
they're
going
to
tell
you
you're
too
late.
so,
it
functions
exactly
as
if
the
words
were
the
following.
you
must
appeal
within...
now,
normally
it
will
say
60
days,
but
in
california
it
says
within
a
reasonable
time.
now,
those
aren't
the
words
of
the
statute,
but
that's
how
it
functions.
and
if
we
don't
read
it
that
way
for
purposes
of
federal
law,
i
guess
we'd
have
to
say
that
in
10,000
case
a
year
in
the
california
superior
courts
involving
state
habeas
petitions...
as
soon
as
those
are
decided,
they
have
to
come
here
because
they're
all
final
decisions
of
the
state
supreme
court.
and
5,000
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
in
california.
once
they
said
final,
they
have
to
come
here.
so,
we
better
have
20,000
new
petitions
each
year
from
the
state
of
california
because
california
happens
to
use
the
word
final
and
new
petition
instead
of
using
the
word
appeal.
now,
what's
wrong
with
what
i
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
in
the...
i've
never
heard
of
this,
and
i
know
a
lot
of
california
lawyers.
i
thought
when
you
go
to
the
superior
court
in
california...
a
prisoner
and
he
says,
i
raise
issues
1,
2,
and
3,
and
they
have
a
record
and
they
decide
it.
and
now
you
go
to
the
california
court
of
appeals.
i
thought
in
the
normal
case
they'll
say,
and
the
superior
court
judge
made
an
error,
and
the
reason
he
made
an
error
is
because
of...
and
then
they'll
cite
witnesses
just
like
an
appeal.
now,
i
grant
you
they
can
do
some
extra
things.
they
can
raise
extra
issues
if
they
want,
and
they
don't
have
to
raise
everything
below
like
any
other
appeal.
but
aside
from
that,
i
don't
know
the
differences.
i've
been
around
for
a
while.
i've
seen
a
few
cases.
i've
never
noticed
some
big
difference.
now,
you'll
tell
me
i'm
all
wrong
about
california,
and
i'm
open
to
hearing
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
interested
in
california
case
law.
i
want
to
know
what
the
practice
is
in
california.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
isn't
the...
the
answer
that...
your...
your
friends
on
the
other
side
give
a...
a
good
answer.
they
say,
look,
the...
the
point
of
requiring
speed
here
is
to
preserve
the
state
interest
and
make
sure
states
don't
have
to
retry
cases
years
and
years
later
and
there's
relative
finality
and
so
on.
if
the
state
wants
to
allow
this
kind
of,
in
effect,
dilatory
proceeding,
the
state
has
no
claim
to
be
offended
by
it.
it's
in
the
state's
power.
so,
if
the
state
wants
to
give
you
10
years
for
habeas,
the
state
hasn't
got
any
complaint.
it
gave
the
10
years
and
it
can
change
its
rule
if
it
wants
to.
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
a
federal
statute
that
is
keyed
to
a
state
statute,
and
the
point
of
doing
this
is
to
preserve
the
state's
interest
in...
in
finality
in
their
own
proceedings
and
to...
to
protect
the
state
from
being
forced,
in
effect,
to
retry
cases
years
and
years
in
the
future
after
the...
the
evidence
has
grown
stale.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
that...
if
those
are
the
objectives
of
the
statute...
and
i
thought
they
were...
then
california,
in
effect,
or
any
state
can
control
the
proceedings
simply
by
its
own
time
schedule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
the
counter
argument
equally
possible?
a
state
that
was
really
concerned
about
timeliness
would
not
have
decided
the
case
also
on
the
merits
as
an
alternative
ground.
therefore,
if
it
does
decide
that
it's
significant
enough
to
get
into
the
merits,
we
ought
to
take
the...
the
state
supreme
court
at
its
word
and
say,
if
there
was
a
merits
determination,
it
obviously
was
not
untimely
in...
in
any
dispositive
sense.
why
isn't
that
an
equally
good
interpretation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
when
the
state
says
two
things
and
they
seem
to
be
in
contradiction...
if
it's
untimely,
then
you
don't
get
to
the
merits.
it's...
it's
unreasonable
in
time.
if
you
do
get
to
the
merits,
it
suggests
that
there
is
something
timely
about
it.
and
all,
i
think,
the
ninth
circuit
was
saying
and
all
i'm
suggesting
is
we're
not
mind
readers.
we
can't
say,
well,
we
guess
they
really
meant
the
first
part
of...
the
first
reason
they
gave
or
they
really
meant
the
second
reason.
we're
simply
going
to
come
up
with
a...
with
a
rule
that
everyone
will
understand
and
that
the
state
courts
can
understand.
and
if
they
get
to
the
merits,
we're
going
to
deem
it
timely
because
we...
we
assume
these
people
are
not
going
to
be
reaching
merits
decisions
on...
on
matters
that
are
totally
untimely
under
their
law.
why...
why
doesn't
that
respect
the
state
courts,
give
a
rule
that
everybody
pretty
much
can
follow
and
know
where
he
stands?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
left
is
a
1-year
federal
statute
of
limitations
after
the
conclusion
of
the
state
proceedings,
and
if
the
state
proceedings
were
begun
in
a
timely
fashion,
i
don't
know
what
else
the
statute
is
supposed
to
accomplish.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
it
look
like
in
practice?
i
mean,
i
had
thought,
as
you
were
saying,
that
whatever
they
call
it,
they
call
the
trial
court
original,
they
call
the
court
of
appeals
original,
they
call
the
supreme
court
original.
but
despite
that,
to
an
outside
observer
who
wasn't
looking
at
the
names,
it
would
look
pretty
much
like
any
other
state
where
you
get
an
initial
hearing
and
then
you
get
some
appeals.
now,
there's
obviously
the
difference,
you
could
file
new
claims
at
the
second
level,
but
leaving
that
aside,
it
would
look...
now,
the
attorney
general
said
i'm
wrong
on
that,
absolutely
wrong,
that
that
isn't
what
it
looks
like,
that
sometimes
at
least
it's
random,
sometimes
they...
they...
just
as
many
might
likely
file,
i
guess,
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
the
district
court.
they
might
file
in
the
supreme
court.
maybe
they
look
for
appeal
in
the...
in
the
trial
court.
i
don't
know.
but
it's
a
random
and...
and,
indeed,
if
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
you'll
see
they
don't
even
look
at
the
record
in
the
trial
court.
all
right.
now,
he
says
that's
how
it's
worked.
he's
been
around
a
long
time.
and
at
that
point,
i'm
not
sure
what
to
do
frankly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
what
does
it
look
like?
i
don't
know
how
you
get
to
that
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you've
practiced
here
a
lot.
i
mean,
if
the...
if
the
superior
court
decision
in
a
state
habeas
matter
is
a
final
decision
and
there's
no
more
review
of
it
in
the
state,
i
guess
then
we
have
jurisdiction
to
review
that.
but
i
have
never
seen
someone
come
here
directly
from
the
decision
of
the
superior
court
of
california
in
a
state
habeas
matter.
maybe
they
just
haven't
thought
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
we
use
justice
scalia...
he
just
suggested
an
idea
that...
that...
if
this
is
right
factually
as
to
how
it
works.
suppose
you
go
into
the
district
court...
the
superior
court,
trial
court.
all
right.
now
i
get
a
decision
there.
now,
i
take
it,
under
california
law,
i
cannot
file
a
complaint
about
how
the
judge
decided
it,
i.e.,
an
appeal,
quotes,
in
any
other
superior
court,
but
i
can
do
it
in
a
higher
court.
am
i
right?
because
they'll
treat
it
as
successive
if
i
go
to
the
parallel
level,
but
if
i
go
to
the
next
level,
they
won't
treat
it
as
successive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
if
in
fact
i
wait
too
long,
i'm
beyond
a
reasonable
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so,
to
put
in
terms
of
exhausted,
unexhausted
as
if
he
did...
as
he
did,
you'd
say
the
only
unexhausted
remedy
you
have
left
to
you,
once
you're
in
the
superior
court,
is
to
go
up,
as
long
as
you
do
it
within
a
reasonable
time.
but
once
you
exceed
the
reasonable
time,
you're
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
what
we
would
have
to
say
is
that
that
system,
looking
to
the
exhausted
instead
of
the
technical
word
appeal,
we'd
get
to
approximately
the
same
place,
and
then
our
issue
would
be,
well,
was
this
beyond
a
reasonable
time
or
not.
and
then
i'd
have
to
say
maybe
we
don't
know.
we'd
have
to
find
out
in
some
way
or
other.
that...
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
i
can't
see
how
we
can
accept
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
frankly
because
they
said
the
very
fact
that
they
say
both,
the
very
fact
that
they
say
we'll
consider
it
on
the
merits
but
it's
untimely,
that
that
means
that
it
wasn't
untimely.
of
course,
they
didn't
use
the
word
untimely.
they
used
a
different
word
which
is
harder
to
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
way
beyond
what
any
other
state
would
have,
isn't
it?
4-and-a-half
months?
unless
there's
some
excuse
here
that
he
didn't
get
the
record
or
he
didn't
know
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
case
is
carey
versus
saffold.
it
is
about
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
which
has
a
requirement
that
the
state
prisoner
has
to
file
for
federal
habeas
corpus
within
one
year
after
his
state
conviction
has
become
final.
well,
what
about
state
collateral
review
proceeding
like
state
habeas
corpus
which
normally
takes
place
after
the
conviction
becomes
final.
the
statute
says
that
that
one
year
period
will
be
tolled
while
an
application
for
state
collateral
review
is
pending.
now,
this
case
presents
three
questions
about
the
meaning
of
that
word
"pending":
first,
is
a
state
application
pending
during
the
interval
between
the
time
a
lower
state
court
rules
on
the
application
and
the
time
the
petitioner
files
a
notice
of
appeal
to
the
higher
state
court.
normally
that
is
a
few
days
because
normally
in
most
states
there
is
a
period
of
time
say
30
days
or
45
days
during
which
you
have
to
file
your
notice
of
appeal
while
you
suppose
wait
10
days
before
filing
it.
what
about
those
10
days?
we
say
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
yes,
that
period
is
part
of
the
ordinary
application
process
and
it
counts
for
tolling
purposes.
what
about
california’s
collateral
review
system
which
is
special?
it
is
special
because
they
do
not
have
a
period
of
appeal
from
the
lower
court
to
the
next
higher
court;
what
they
say
is
you
have
to
file
a
new
petition
in
the
higher
court,
and
you
have
to
do
it
within
a
reasonable
time.
but
what
about
that
period
of
time,
between
the
lost
in
the
lower
court
you
have
not
yet
filed
your
petition
in
the
higher
court.
well,
we
say
that
it
is
different
but
the
difference
does
not
matter.
we
say
that
california’s
original
filing
review
system
is
functionally
similar
to
the
appeal
system
that
other
states
have
and
we
find
that
the
law
treats
them
similarly.
alright
third,
what
about
the
petitioner's
request
for
review
in
this
case?
and
here
the
petitioner
filed
his
new
original
writ
in
the
higher
court
4
months
really
later.
well,
was
it
pending
or
was
he
out
of
time?
now,
that
is
a
little
complicated
because
california’s
time
period
is
not
like
30
days
or
45
days
it
just
says
reasonable
time.
well,
what
we
say
there
and
we
spell
out
the
reasons
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
when
it
faced
that
question
it
did
not
do
so
correctly;
it
had
an
absolute
rule
they
tried
to
apply.
we
say
they
were
wrong
on
that
but
we
remand
the
case
so
that
they
can
work
out
whether
or
not
it
was
timely
given
the
principles
in
our
opinion.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas.
