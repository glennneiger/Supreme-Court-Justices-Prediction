justice
william
h.

we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
01-301,
tom
l.
carey
v.
tony
eugene
saffold.
mr.
cross.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
the
traditional
rule
in
habeas
corpus,
at
least
in...
in
england.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
it?
that
you
could
go
from
one
court
to
another
and
have...
have
a
different
judge
look
at
it
in
a
different
proceeding
and
get
a
different
result.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereabouts
on
page
31?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did...
in
the
proceedings
involved
in
this
particular
case,
did
either
of
the
appellate
courts
go
the...
do
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
the
case
where
the
petitioner
prevails--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
superior
court,
and
by
statute,
now
california
allows
the
state
to
appeal
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
that
would
be...
that
would
be
pending
all
that
time,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
would
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
know,
it
can...
it
could
be
not
an
appellate
system
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
petitioner
who
has
to
have
an
original
petition
each...
each
time
he
goes
again
to
a
new
court.
but
the
legislature
said,
with
respect
to
the
state,
if
the...
if
the
state
loses,
it
can
appeal,
then
that
would
be
an
appellate
proceeding,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
superior.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice
breyer
suggests
that
when
you
go,
say,
from
the
superior
court
to
the
district
court
of
appeal,
it's...
it's
like
an
appeal.
well,
now,
is
there
a
transcript
of
the
record
made
in
the
superior
court
that
you
have
to
file
with
the
district
court
of
appeal
like
you
would
in
other
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
in
the
superior
court
to
go
to
the
district
court
of
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
also
i
think
what
is
meant
by
pending
because
if...
if
we
were...
if
it
were
determined
that
these
separate
matters,
as
you
say,
before
three
different
courts
were
pending
only
during
the
time
those
particular
courts
had
them
for
consideration,
it
might
be
quite
a
different
result
than
if
you
say
look
at
the
reasonableness
of
the
whole
series
of
proceedings
together.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
cross.
mr.
ogden,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
you
going
to
cover
the
question
of
whether
these
various
actions
were
pending
and
for
how
long?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
text
of
aedpa
or
the
text
of
california's
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you
say
the...
the
application
is
distinct
from
the
claim.
granted,
both
words...
how
does
that
work
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
presumably
you
could
go
back
and
forth
to
a
number
of
california
courts,
if
you
come
up
with,
you
know,
a
different
argument
and
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean...
what
do
you
mean
by
a...
do
you
mean
the
same
thing
as
an
original
petition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
so,
what...
what
do
you
mean
by
the
term
successive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
didn't--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what's
the
date
of
that
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
it
is
then
filed,
what
do
you
mean
by
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your...
i
mean,
mr.
cross
apparently
has
been
practicing
in
california
for
15
years.
i
think
if
you're
going
to
make...
you
don't
claim
to
be
personally
familiar
with
california
law,
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
then
i
think
perhaps
you
should
cite
some
authority.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
the
record
is
part
of
the
process
in
the
court
of
appeal.
that's
a
very,
very
vague
statement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
we
want
to
know
is
typically
in
an
appeal,
you'd
have
a
record
from
the
superior
court.
you're
appealing
from
the
superior
court
or
the
district
court
of
appeal,
you
have
to...
you
must
file
the
record.
it's
a
part
of
the...
before
the
court
of
appeals
will
hear
your
claim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is...
is
there
any...
some
possibility
that
those
perhaps
inconsistent
rulings
coming
from
the
supreme
court
of
california
might
be
based
on
what
mr.
cross
referred
to
as
the
division
of
opinion
within
that
court
as
to
whether
they
should
give
any
sort
of
an
explanation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
any
of
them
dealing
with
a
system
like
california's?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
a
federal
magistrate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ogden.
mr.
cross,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cross.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
01-301
carey
versus
saffold
and
another
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
