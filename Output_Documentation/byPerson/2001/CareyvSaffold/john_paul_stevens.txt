justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
may
i
just
ask
this
question?
if
in
this
case
the
california
court
did
decide
on
the
merits...
apparently...
it's
a
little
ambiguous,
but
it
seems
to...
wouldn't
that
definitely
disclose
a
decision
that
it
was
reasonable?
they
took
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
excuse
untimeliness,
they're
saying
in
this
particular
case
we
think
it
must
have
been
reasonable.
aren't...
isn't
that...
doesn't
that
necessarily
follow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
you
say
to
the
possibility
that
we
might
certify
the
question
to
the
california
supreme
court
whether
this
case
was
dismissed
because
it
was
untimely?
