justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
happens
just
as
a
practical
matter?
you
go
to
the
superior
court
on
a
collateral
attack
with
a...
with
a
petition
for
a
writ,
and
the
court
makes
lots
of
findings
and
rulings
of
law.
some
of
those
rulings
of
law
are
absolutely
wrong,
but
still,
the
ultimate
outcome
may
be
in
doubt.
and
so
then
the
petitioner,
the
original
petitioner,
wants
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
does...
does
he
annex
what
happens
in...
in
the
superior
court
just
for
the
enlightenment
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
what
the
issues
are
or
what
the
wrong
rulings
were,
what
the
right
rulings
were,
what
the
findings
were?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
just
background.
i...
i
see
where
to
find
it
now.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
getting
to
the
issue
in
the
case,
the
respondent's
brief
points
out
that
under
the
theory
you
propose,
what
would
happen
if
it's
the...
the
state
that's
appealing
or
filing
a
new...
not
appealing,
but
filing
a
new
action?
the...
the
prisoner
wins
in...
in
the
lower
court,
and
then
the
state
files
an
action.
how...
how
would
you
count
that
or
not
count
that
so
far
as
the
limitations
period
is
concerned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
i...
but...
if...
if
i
may,
just
one
moment,
justice
breyer.
what
the
chief
justice
suggests
is
that
i...
i
did
not
pose
a
problem
because
what
happens
is
is
that
the
state
simply
appeals
the...
what
it
thinks
to
be
the
erroneous
ruling,
and
that
means
the
action
is
still
pending.
but
i...
i
thought
from
our
earlier
interchange
that
you
thought
there
was
a
bigger
problem
than
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
chief
justice
suggests
it's
not
rocket
science
for
us
to
say
it's
still
pending
if
there's
an
appeal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
am
i
missing
something?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
let's...
let's
continue
that
hypothetical
that
justice
o'connor
gives.
there's
a
long
wait,
years
of
wait.
they
go
to
the...
the
prisoner
goes
to
the
california
supreme
court.
the
california
supreme
court
said,
you
are
late.
you
have
lacked
diligence.
we
will
not
rule
on
the
merits.
dismissed.
when
does
the
federal
statute...
how
does
the
federal
statute
apply
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
position
that
you
urge
upon
us
here
in
that
instance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
trying
to...
i'm
trying
to
interpret
the
statute,
and
so
i
imagined
this
case
and
i
want
to
know
how
it
would
come
out--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--under
your
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--just
so...
just
so
i
understand
your
answer.
in
the
case
that
i
put
that
i
didn't
quite
get
the
whole...
the
california
court
says,
you've
waited
4
years.
that's
too
late.
how
do
i
apply
the
statute
of
limitations
to
that
context
or
the
pending
rule
that
we're
discussing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
is...
what
is
your
submission
as
to
how
we
ought
to
interpret
the
rule
in
that
instance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
do...
i
do
want,
if
i
can,
very
quickly
to
get
to
the
question
that
mr.
cross
said
was
very
difficult
and
you
raise
it
at
pages
24
and
25
of
your
brief.
you
say
what...
what
happens
if
the...
under
the
theory
that
the
petitioner
proposes,
if
the
state
files
an
appeal
when
the
state
has
lost.
and
the
chief
justice
said,
well,
that
shouldn't
be
a
problem
because
we
can
then
easily
say
that
the
application
is
still
pending.
how
long
does
the
state
have
to
appeal
generally?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
then...
so,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
isn't
a
problem.
a,
it's
just
30
days,
and
b,
you
can
say
that
it's
still
pending.
so,
that's
not
a
big
problem.
mr.
cross,
whose
right
of
rebuttal
we've
demolished,
so
i
can't
ask
him,
has
said
that
that's
a
very
hard
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
can't
we
easily
say
the
application
is
pending
so
long
as
the
state
has
an
appeal--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--prevail?
