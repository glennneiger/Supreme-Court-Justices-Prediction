justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
you...
you
can
begin
in
a
higher
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
begin--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i
thought
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
confused
now.
i
thought
your
position
was
that
the
case
may
well
be
pending,
as
justice
kennedy
says,
but
there's
no
application
pending--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
the
appeal.
the
application
has
been
disposed
of
in
the
first
court.
there's
an
appeal,
but
there's
no
longer
an
application
pending.
and
that's
how
the
statute
reads,
not
the
case
is
pending.
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
but
it
didn't
excuse
untimeliness.
untimeliness
was
one
of
the
two
bases
for
their
decision,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cross,
as...
as
i
understand
your
submission,
it
doesn't
matter.
that
was
not
the
ground
on
which
the
ninth
circuit
decided
the
case,
you
contend.
they
decided
it
simply
on
the
ground
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
addressed
the
merits.
end
of
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cross,
a
state
supreme
court
that
had
that
attitude,
that
didn't
care
that
you
were
late,
would
not...
would
not
have
dismissed
this
case
on
two
grounds,
one
of
which
is
it's
untimely.
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
we
don't
have
a
situation
in
which
the
california
supreme
court
said,
we
don't
care
how
late
it
is;
we're
going
to
decide
it
on
the
merits.
it
decided
on
two
grounds,
one
of
which
is
you...
you
are
too
late
under
our...
under
our
rules.
and...
and
the
ninth
circuit
just
ignored
that.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
happens
if
it...
go
on.
give
us
your
second--
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
you
know,
we
were
confronted
with
precisely
the
same
argument
in
artuz
which
dealt
with
what
constitutes
a
properly
filed
application.
and
the
argument
was
if
the
claim
is
not
a
proper
claim,
if
it
does
not
lie
under
the
state
law,
it
is
not
a
properly
filed
application.
and
we
held,
no,
that's
not
so.
an
application
is
an
application
and
a
claim
is...
is
a
claim.
and
the...
the
application
is
properly
filed
so
long
as
it's
given
to
the...
you
know,
to
the
proper
clerk
in
the
proper
court
and...
and
so
forth.
now,
dealing
with
the
very
same...
very
same
provision
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
pacific
second?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr....
mr.
cross
said...
and
it
would
be
extraordinary
if
it's
record
review,
but
you
don't
have
to
file
the
record.
when...
when
you
go
into
the
court
of
appeals,
do
you
have
to
file
the
record
of...
of
the
decision
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
ordinarily
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
the...
that's
not
what
mr.
cross
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
wouldn't
issue
habeas
when...
when
you
have
failed
to
exhaust
all
of
your
state
remedies
whether
it's
by
appeal
or
not
by
appeal.
if
you
still
have
state
remedies
available,
we
wouldn't
issue
federal
habeas.
it...
it
would
be
useless
to
come
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
and
that
applies
whether
it's
an
appeal
or
whether
it's
an
independent
action.
i
mean,
it...
it
sheds
no
light
upon...
upon
the
central
issue
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
whichever
one
it
is,
you
have
to
exhaust
those
remedies
before
you
apply
for
federal
habeas.
justice
antonin
scalia
retroactively.
i
mean,
there's
a
split.
there
are
real
problems
and...
and
those
problems,
as
well
as
the
problems
with
the
california
system,
seem
to
me
good
reason
to
read
the
statute
the
way
it's
written
so
that
there
has
to
be
an
application
pending,
not...
not
a
case
pending,
but
an
application.
on
appeal,
it
could
be
the
application
of
either
the
petitioner
or
the
government
if
it
lost,
but
the
only
time
counted
is
the...
is
the
time
during
the
pending
application.
then
you
would
not
have
to
worry
about
these
problems.
what
happens
if
they
accept
a...
you
know,
a
late
petition?
does
it
automatically
toll
retroactively
for
the...
for
the
period
after
the
due
date
and
so
forth?
justice
antonin
scalia
none
of
those
problems
exist
if
you...
if
you
say
it's
pending
when
it's
pending.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
the
basis
on
which
the
ninth
circuit
decided
the
case.
it
did
not
resolve
whether,
you
know,
the
4-and-a-half
or
the
other
one.
it...
it
did
not
do
it.
it
just
simply
said,
since
the
supreme
court
of
california
alternatively
addressed
the
merits,
that's
the
end
of
it.
and
so
you're...
you're
not
defending
their
basis
for...
for
deciding
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
the...
didn't
the
superior
court
here,
or
at
least
the
magistrate
did,
made
a
specific
finding
to
the
effect
that
the
4-month
delay
was
not
excusable,
that
it
was
an
excessive
delay?
wasn't
there
that
finding
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
was
a
finding
that
the
4-month
period
was
the...
was
a
period
of
inexcusable
delay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
to
say
that
that
couldn't
have
been
what
the
supreme
court
was
thinking
of
strikes
me
as
implausible.
