justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cross,
would
you
explain
to
us
what
it
is
in
california...
what
is
the
system
and
the
time
within
which
post-conviction
relief
can
be
applied
for
in
california
courts?
is
there
any
time
limit
for
filing
it
with
the
trial
court
level?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
now,
here
there
was
a
prompt
filing
in
the...
at
the
trial
court
level.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
here
there
was
a
prompt
filing
at
the
trial
court
level
for
habeas,
state
habeas.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
all
right.
it
was...
it
was
within
the
statutory
period
that
we
have
imposed
for
these
situations
where
it
had...
aedpa
became
effective.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
after
the
trial
court
resolved
it
and
denied
relief,
then
there's
no
review
mechanism
other
than
filing
an
original
writ
with
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
how
it's
done?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
that
again
a
reasonable
time
period
within
which
to
seek
review
by
that
mechanism
in
the
court
of
appeals?
or
is
there
a
time
limit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--why
don't
you
tell
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
can
they
go...
start
over
again
and
go
down
to
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
no
bar
in
california
to
going
back
as
many
times
as
you
want
if
you
have
a
new
claim
each
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
what...
what
is
the
general
rule
in
other
states
that
are
unlike
california
that
say
you
go
for
post-conviction
relief
first
to
the
trial
court?
let
them
decide
it.
then
you
have
30
days
or
whatever
it
is
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
if
that's
denied,
you
have
x
number
of
days
to
go
to
the
state
supreme
court.
now,
in
a
state
like
that,
is
it
the
case
that
in
applying
aedpa
in
this
statute
of
limitations,
that
we
exclude
all
of
the
time
for
decision
making
as
well
as
that
statutory
time
within
which
to
file
the
appeal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
what
a
majority
of
courts
are
holding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
yes,
but
is
it...
is
it
the
case
that
most
courts
are
holding,
under
the
scheme
i
described,
that
not
only
while
the
court
is
deciding
it,
but
the
time
allowed
to
enable
them
to
go
to
the
next
higher
court
is
excluded
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
all
right.
so,
the
problem
with
california
is
we
have
no
time
specified.
we
have
a
reasonable
time.
how
are
we
supposed
to
decide
what's
reasonable
in
california?
should
we
certify
a
question
back
to
the
california
supreme
court
and
say,
was
this
a
reasonable
time?
how
do
we
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
we
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wouldn't
that
be
up
to
california
to
do?
what
we
have
is
a
system
that
allows
a
reasonable
time.
i'm
asking
you
how
we
determine
what
is
a
reasonable
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
that
a...
a
prisoner
has
filed
in
california
for
state
post-conviction
review
in
the
superior
court
and
then
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
makes
no
filing
in
the
state
supreme
court,
could
but
years
go
by.
then
there's
a
petition
filed
for
habeas
in
the
federal
court.
now,
the
federal
court
under
your
view
presumably
would
have
to
say,
no,
it's
still
pending
in
the
state
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
you
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
say
it
is
unexhausted
and...
and
the...
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
hasn't
run.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have...
have
any
courts
considering
this
aedpa
statute
applied
it
in
the
way
justice
scalia
suggests
that
we
look
at
pending
and
place
all
the
emphasis
there
and
exclude
all
time
after
a
decision
by
a
state
court
until
the
next
filing?
