mr.
stanley
a.
cross
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
aedpa's
language,
purpose,
and
legislative
history
supports
the
conclusion
that
the
circuit
conflict
over
the
meaning
of
pending
in
28
u.s.c.,
section
2244
(d)(2)
can
be
resolved
by
reversing
the
ninth
circuit
for
one
or
more
of
the
following
three
reasons.
first,
the
ninth
circuit
improperly
permits
tolling
for
substantial
delay
if
the
state
supreme
court
addresses
the
merits
when
denying
an
application
for
collateral
review.
second,
under
california's
system
of
successive
original
petitions,
nothing
is
pending
under
state
or
federal
law
following
the
denial
of
an
application
for
collateral
review
and
prior
to
the
proper
filing
of
a
new
application
for
review.
and
third,
the
gap
theory
relied
upon
by
the
district
court
more
accurately
reflects
congressional
intent
and
the
policy
judgments
underlying
aedpa's
1-year
statute
of
limitations
than
does
the
ninth
circuit's
interpretation
of
pending--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--it's
within
a
reasonable
time,
your
honor,
the
general
rule
of
timeliness.
however,
within
a
reasonable
time
has
parameters
which
i
can
give
you
the
case
of
in
re
harris,
a
california
supreme
court
case,
which
addresses
that.
specifically,
it
says
the
following
in
footnote
7.
that's...
the
cite
is
5
cal.
4th
at
828-829.
footnote
7
says
the
following.
the
general
rule
regarding
timeliness
is
the
habeas
corpus
petition
must
be
filed
within
a
reasonable
time
after
the
petitioner
counsel
knew
or
with
due
diligence
should
have
known
the
facts
underlying
the
claim,
as
well
as
the
legal
basis
of
the
claim.
they
then
follow
that
up
with
two
significant
points.
the
first
is,
is
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims,
which
is
the
claim
in
this
particular
litigation,
should
be
filed
as
a
verified...
excuse
me...
a
verified
petition
jointly
with
the
direct
appeal.
in
other
words,
if
you
know
about
the
claim,
you
should
file
it
at
that
time.
now,
as
far
as
how
long
you
should
be
able
to
wait,
the
rules
specifically
state
with
regard
to
capital
cases,
which
are
considered
to
be
much
more
complex
than
the
average
non-capital
case,
they
give
them
a
90-day
period
in
which
there
is
a
presumption
of
timeliness
so
that
there
is
no
substantial
delay.
you
have
a
presumption
that
you
have
not
exceeded
substantial
delay
if
you
do
it
within
90
days.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
pardon?
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
i
would...
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
that
it
was
prompt
since
he
waited
5
years--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--he
filed
his
claim
with
7
days
remaining--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--in
the
grace
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
correct,
in
california.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
as
far
as
the...
the
time
between
each
original
petition,
there
is
no
time
limit.
you
would
be
looking
at
the
overall
time
period
because
you're
dealing
with...
your
honor,
with
original
petitions
here.
so
he
has
every
right
in
california
to
go
directly
to
the
california
supreme
court
or
the
third
district
court
of
appeal.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
in
fact,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
correct
a
misunderstanding
that's
promoted
by
the
respondent's
brief.
if
you
look
at
the
red
brief
at
page
31,
it
gives
the
impression
that
you
are
indicating
that
if
you
were
to
go
directly
to
the
california
supreme
court--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--on
page
31
at
the
top
paragraph,
there's
a
reference
in
the
third
line
to
in
re
hillery.
then
there's
a
reference,
the
ninth
circuit
case,
harris
v.
superior
court,
indicating
that
california
appellate
courts
may
refuse
to
entertain
habeas
and
that
it
be
sent
back
to
the
trial
court.
that's
an
incorrect
statement
of
law,
and
i'll
refer
you
to
the
actual
footnote
on
that
page,
footnote
19,
referring
to
california
rule
of
court
56(a)(1).
the
problem
with
respondent's
position
is
that
he
gives
a
literal
quote
of
56(a)(1)
and
it
sounds
like
that's
the
proposition
that
you're
referring
to,
but
he
ignores
to
cite
to
the
subsection
(h),
which
is,
as
of
january
1st
of
this
year,
is
now
labeled
subsection
(i),
which
specifically
states,
quote...
and
the
title
of
the
subsection
is
proceedings
not
covered
by
this
rule.
quote:
the
provisions
of
this
rule
shall
not
apply
to
applications
for
a
writ
of

corpus
or
to

pursuant
to
rules
57,
58,
and
59.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
yes.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
right,
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
the...
that
is
explained,
your
honor,
in
harris
v.
superior
court,
the
ninth
circuit
opinion--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--i
will
tell
you,
your
honor.
the...
the
way
it
is
handled
is
the
california
supreme
court
around
1969
set
up
a
procedure
in
which
for
original
petitions
in
the
appellate
court
that
are
filed
there,
either
in
the...
the
district
court
of
appeal
or
the
california
supreme
court,
they
can
have
a
special
master,
or
they
can
send
it
back
to
the
trial
court,
so
that
there's
no
prevention
from
them
taking
the
court
and
deciding
it
with
or
without
the
hearing.
but
a
prima
facie
case
must
be
made
to
them
in
order
for
those--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--no.
there
was...
the...
the
district
court
of
appeal
is
a
one-line
denial,
simply
stating
denied.
and
in
the
california
supreme
court,
the
petition
was
denied
on
the
merits
and
for
lack
of
diligence.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
the
forms,
your
honor,
are
in
the
joint
appendix
where
you
are
expected
to
indicate...
it's...
all
three
petitions
use
the
same
judicial
counsel
form.
california
supreme
court
petition...
if
you
want
to
look,
it
starts
at
page
31.
and
there...
i
believe
there
is
a
question
which
asks
the
defendant
if
they've
sought
review
in
another
court
and
to
explain
what
the
finding
was
of
that
court
and
what
claims
were
requested.
that
would
be,
for
example,
question
9,
did
you
seek
review
in
the...
excuse
me.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
the...
that's
the
extent
of
it.
and
so,
the
purpose
of
that
question
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
it's
a...
it's
a
successive
petition
so
they
cannot...
if
they
had
gone
to
the
lower
court,
it
can't
be
remanded
back
because
the...
if
the
petition
has
been
denied
in
the
lower
court,
they
don't
want
to
send
it
back
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
the
same
judge
or
court
who
has
gone
through
the
proceeding
before
and
denied
it.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
that
is
the
most
difficult
question
that
is
posed,
without
question,
your
honor.
the
response
i
would
have
is
it
appears
to
me
that
congress
perhaps
did
not
think
of
that
particular
scenario
other
than
perhaps
that
under
2244(d)(1)(b),
the
state-created
impediment
issue
would
take
care
of
the
extreme
case
where
the...
where
the
state
was
trying
to
prevent
the
person's
time
from--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--right.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
if
you--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--if
you
take
the
position
that
it's
not
an
appellate
system
in
a
state
like
california,
i
don't
think
it
would
be.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
for
california...
under
california
law,
your
honor,
absolutely.
but
as
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned,
i
think
we're
interested
in
what
the
federal
law
is
and
how
the
congress
would
have
viewed
it.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
i
think
there
is
a
bigger
problem
because
if
there
is...
it
depends
on
when
finality
occurs,
and
if...
if
you
have
an
original
proceeding
and
the
decision
is
final
upon
that
decision,
the
clock
would,
i
would
assume,
start
at
least
under
california
law.
the
case
laws
that's
referred
to
in
the
yellow
brief
under
subsection
(c)--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
right.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
what's
wrong
with
what
you
said,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
is
that
although
california
may
say
that
it's
final
at
that
level,
it
does
not
prevent
the
individual
from
going
to
either
of
the
other
two
next
levels
or
skipping
one
and
going
to
the
other
because
they
are
in
fact
original
and
in
fact
not...
it's
more
than
just
mere
semantics
because
they
can
go
to
california
with
different
claims.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
same
petition
at
all.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
typically
not.
there
could
be
some
circumstances,
under
rare
circumstances,
where
the
superior
court
would
have
some
sort
of
evidentiary
hearing.
there
would
be
a
transcript.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
no,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
the
california
case
law,
in
fact,
indicates
that--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--the
practice
is
quite
different
from
the
description
that
you
gave.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
in
fact,
there
are...
i
don't
have
the
exact
statistics,
but
in
my
15
years
of
experience
in
practicing,
i
have
seen
probably
around
40
to
50
percent
of
the
cases
not
go
to
the
trial
court,
that
in
fact,
very
commonly
they
go
directly
to
the
california
supreme
court,
and
they
are
denied.
that's
a
very
common
experience
in
california--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--not...
your
honor,
not
on
those
same
claims,
they
certainly
can't.
california
and
other
states
would
perhaps
bar
successive
petitions
if
it's
the
same
claims.
it
doesn't
necessarily
prevent
them
from
coming
back
with
something
else
that
they've
discovered
at
a
later
time--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--there
are
escape
clauses
in
california,
as
well
as
other
states,
that...
that
allow
you,
if
you
discover,
just
like
the
federal
statute,
new
claims.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
aedpa
grants--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--the
majority
of
courts
are
holding
that...
and
the
statute
specifically
provides
for
tolling
for
all
the
time
in
which
the
decision...
excuse
me...
in
which
the
petition
is
before
a
court.
that's,
you
know,
specifically
provided.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
the
majority
of
courts
are
holding
that
you
will
get
time
for
the
appeal
time
that's
specified
by
the
state,
for
example,
60
days
or
90
days.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
one--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--one
suggestion
that
was
made
in
the
amicus
briefs
by
the
criminal
justice
legal
foundation
is
to
adopt
the
nearest
analogous
state
rule,
which
in
california
under
rule
2
or
30
through
31
would
be
60
days.
that's
one
thing
that
could
be
done
by
the
court
which
would
stretch
the
statutory
language
to...
to
bring
california
into
an
appellate
system
which--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--i
think,
your
honor,
the
way
to
determine
a
reasonable
time
would
be
to
look
at
the
california
rules
for
their
original
habeas
petitions
and
determine
that
under
california
law,
we
know
that...
that
you
are
expected
to
file
no
longer
than
90
days
in
a
capital
case
without
having
a
presumption
of
timeliness--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--and
that
would
be
the
absolute
outside
limit
for
a
determination
of
what
would
be
reasonable.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
no,
your
honor.
i...
i
believe
that
the...
the
interpretation
would
be
that
even
though
a...
a
state
supreme
court
decided,
at
least
alternatively
on
the
merits...
simply
indicates
that
for
one
reason
or
another,
they
decided
to
perhaps
excuse
untimeliness
if
they
didn't
have
a...
an
untimeliness
finding--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--in
this
particular
case,
they
said
he
acted
with
a
lack
of
diligence.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
in
this
case,
absolutely.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
your
honor,
this
situation
is
even
more
perplexing
than
what
you
set
forth
because
there
are
three
possibilities.
one
is
that
it's
the
5-year
period
the
california
is
returning
to...
referring
to.
another
possibility
it's
just
the
4-and-a-half-month.
and
the
third
possibility
is
the
combination
of
all
of
those
periods.
the
question
simply
is
what
is
meant
by
timely
and
what
is
meant
by
properly
pursuing.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
your
honor,
absolutely
that
is
correct.
if
we
look
at
the
language--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--right.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
the
california
supreme
court
holding
and
the...
the
problem
it
presents
for
the
statute
is...
is
that
it
eviscerates
the
statute
by
holding
that
as
long
as...
as
the
state
supreme
court
addresses
the
merits,
that
regardless
of
the
length
of
the
delay,
which
could
be
not
just
4-and-a-half
months
in
this
case,
but
4-and-a-half
years
or
4-and-a-half
decades,
they
will
excuse
the
delay.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
your
honor,
the
answer
to
that
is
that
this
is
a
federal
statute
not
a
state
statute.
we're
not
changing
the--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--that's--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--your
honor,
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
objectives
of
the
statute,
but
there
are
a
number
of
policy
interests
related
to
the
statute
of
limitations
itself
which
is
part
of
aedpa.
you're
absolutely
correct
in
that
finality
is
one
of
the
three
main
concerns
of
aedpa
itself,
but
there
are
other
concerns
and
policy
concerns
related
to
the
statute
itself.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
i
think,
your
honor,
this
court
has
stated
before
in
coleman
v.
thompson
that
we...
that
you
don't
want
to
direct
the
state
courts
how
to
issue
their
rulings
for
whatever
state
reasons
they
have
for
doing
it.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
your
honor,
because
it
would,
in
effect,
eviscerate
the
statute
of
limitations
under
federal
law.
if
you
have
unlimited
tolling
for
20
or
30
years,
there
is
not
much
left
of
the
1-year
federal
statute
of
limitations.
and
under
harris
v.
reed,
alternative--
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
--well,
your
honor,
the
statute...
statutory
schemes
across
the
country...
there's
a
wide
variety,
of
which
there
are
over
20
states
that
have
no
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
it's
usually
a
combination,
your
honor.
there's
in
fact,
a
dispute
between
the
members
of
the
california
supreme
court
as
to
whether
to
even
pose
procedural
bars.
justice
brown
has
argued
that
it
only
should
be
addressed
on
the
merits.
so,
there's
a
combination
usually
or
sometimes
just
a
denial
on
the
merits.
if
you
don't
mind,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
stanley
a.
cross
i
think
the
answer
to
mr.
ogden,
your
honor,
is
that
the
reason
would
be
that
congress
was
concerned
about
undue
delay.
in
the
last
10
years
before
aedpa
was
passed,
over
80
bills
were
attempted
to...
to
deal
with
this
problem.
and
lack
of
diligence
by
petitioners
was
the
main
concern
of
congress,
and
they
dealt
with
that
by
writing
into
the
statute
the
following
phrase.
