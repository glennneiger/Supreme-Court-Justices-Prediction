mr.
david
l.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
answer
to
the
question
presented
today
is
found
in
the
broad
terms
and
policies
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
question,
of
course,
is
what
effect
does
mr.
baker's
arbitration
agreement
have
on
the
eeoc's
litigation
remedies.
the
fourth
circuit
correctly
held
that
the
eeoc
could
bring
in
court
a
claim
for
broad-based
injunctive
relief
and
declaratory
relief.
however,
because
mr.
baker
had
agreed
to
arbitrate
his
claims,
he
could
not
seek
relief
in
court
specifically
for
mr.
baker.
now,
i...
i
listened
carefully
to
mr.
clement's
argument
about
the
issue
of
settlement
of
a
claim,
and
i
must
respectfully
disagree
with
the
authority
and
line
of
cases
that
he's
citing.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
position,
as
i
understand
it
from
mr.
clement,
is
that
an
individual
can
settle
a
claim
and
then
the
eeoc
can
later
sue
on
behalf
of
that
individual
and
recover
relief
for
that
individual.
and
that
particular
principle,
if
that
is
what
the
eeoc
is
espousing
today,
contradicts
their
own
policy
guidance--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--well,
perhaps
i
perceived
it
differently,
your
honor.
but
i...
i
do
think
that
from
our
position
it's
very
important
for
the
court
to
understand
that
the
cases
are
almost
uniform
for
the
proposition
that
if
an
individual
settles
a
case--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
it
should
be
given
primacy
when
an
individual
has
signed
an
arbitration
agreement
in
which
he
says
i
agree
that
all
claims
arising
out
of
my
employment
shall
be
resolved
in
arbitration.
we
don't
see
any
reason
why
that
case
needs
to
wait
for
the
eeoc
to--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--well,
your
honor,
it
should
be,
but
the
eeoc
doesn't
take
that
position,
as
i
understand
it.
as
i
understand
their
position,
whatever
happens
in
their
court
proceeding
is
an
independent
action
and
that
mr.
baker
really
doesn't
have
any
control
over.
and
they're
doing
their
own
thing
in
court.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
it
would,
your
honor,
if
there
were
findings
of
fact
that
were
common
to
the
other
proceeding.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
well,
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
you
on
that
because
i
believe
that
in
the
arbitration,
if
there
were...
an
adjudication
was
made
as
to
mr.
baker
and
in...
as
in
this
particular
case...
if
i
may
use
this
case
as
the
example,
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
baker
is
the
only
game
in
town
here.
the
eeoc
is
seeking
relief
solely
on
behalf
of
mr.
baker.
all
damages
will
go
to
mr.
baker.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
your
honor,
i...
i
still
believe
that
there's
no
reason
to
wait
in
this
case,
that
the
arbitration
can
go
forward
to
resolve
mr.
baker's
individual
claims,
that
the
eeoc,
under
the
fourth
circuit
rule,
can
go
forward
and
have
the
claims
for
broad-based
injunctive
relief
heard
there.
and
i...
i
must
say
that
there
may
be
separate
issues
being
litigated
in
that
eeoc
court
proceeding
because--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--there
must
be,
but
in
the
court
proceeding,
there's
going
to
be
a
broader
finding,
that
there
is
some
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination
going
on
that
may
or...
may
or
may
not
apply
to
mr.
baker.
if
it
does
apply
to
mr.
baker,
i
would
agree
with
you.
then
that
particular
ruling
would
have
some
collateral
estoppel
effect
in
the
arbitration.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
your
honor,
in
that
particular
case,
if
the
arbitrator
makes
a
ruling
that
there
was
some
practice--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--not
that
particular
very
issue
of
liability,
but
what
i'm...
what
i'm
anticipating--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--what
i...
what
i'm
anticipating--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--i
am
anticipating
from
your
hypothetical
that
a
specific
finding
is
being
made
about
mr.
baker
being
discriminated
against
based
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
his
case.
what
i
am
anticipating
going
in
the
court
proceeding
is
some
claim
for
broad-based
injunctive
relief
that
may...
may
involve
mr.
baker
and
may
not.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
your
honor,
the
eeoc,
to
the
extent
that
it's
bringing
a
public
enforcement
action,
something
involving
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination,
something--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--just--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--if
it...
if
the
injunction
is
solely
based
on
relief
specific
to
mr.
baker
and
the
facts
of
his
case,
yes,
it
would
be
binding.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
well,
your
honor,
the...
the
authority
would
be
that
based
on
general
principles
of
collateral
estoppel
where
there's
been...
these
issues
have
been
litigated
and--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
making--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--well,
it
is
and
it
runs
throughout
our
brief,
your
honor,
and
it
runs
throughout
what
i'm...
what
i'm
going
to
say
to
the
court
is
that
basically
what...
what
is
happening
here,
in
the...
in
the
terms
of
seeking
individual
relief,
is
that
the
eeoc
is
acting
on
behalf
of
mr.
baker.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
it
is,
your
honor,
and...
and
essentially
the
eeoc
is
standing
in
the
shoes
of
mr.
baker
when
you
look
at
this
case
because
it
is...
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix,
page
51
and
52,
the
interrogatory
responses
from
the
eeoc,
you
see
that
they
acknowledge
they
are
seeking...
when
asked
what...
what
damages
are
you
seeking
in
this
case,
we
are
seeking
relief
on
behalf
of
mr.
baker.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
there
is,
your
honor.
there's
a
public
interest
in
a
case
such
as
that,
and
there's
also
a
public
interest
in
any
claim
that
an
individual
brings
to
vindicate
the
anti-discrimination--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--true,
your
honor,
but
that
public
interest
can
be
vindicated
just
as
effectively
in
arbitration.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
they
can
continue
to
pursue
that
claim
for
broad-based
injunctive
relief
involved.
but...
but
here's
the
rub.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
it
does
say
that,
and
the
relief
would
not
be
appropriate
where
an
individual
has
signed
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
well...
well,
the
answer
to
your
case
i
think
is
found
in
the
federal
arbitration
act
because
this
individual
agreed
to
arbitrate--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--all
right.
your
honor,
if...
may
i
ask
you
to
again
assert
your
proposition?
mr.
david
l.
gordon
yes.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
they
can
do
that.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
well,
there
is,
of
course,
the...
the
strong
federal
policy
favoring
arbitration,
the
text
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
that
says,
we're
going
to
enforce
agreements.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
true.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
true.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
your
honor,
the
eeoc
in
these
cases...
and
i
hope
i
can
be
responsive
to
your
question.
the
eeoc
in
these
cases
takes
its
employee
as
it
finds
it,
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
employee
has
an
arbitration
agreement.
and
individual
conduct
can
limit
the
ability
of
the
eeoc
to
seek
remedies
in
a
case.
it
happens
in
a
number
of
different
contexts.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
your
honor,
the...
the
notion
of
the
importance
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
that
these
agreements
have
to
be
put
on
the
same
footing
as
other
contracts,
and
we
must
give
force
to
an
arbitration
agreement
such
as
this.
and
to
allow
parties
to
come
up
with
ways
to
get
around
these
agreements
completely
undercuts
the
federal
arbitration
act.
and
i...
i
would
disagree
with
your
premise,
if
i...
if
i
may,
respectfully,
that
arbitration
is
a
forum
selection
clause.
it's
a
lot
more
than
that.
it
is
a...
it
is
a
method
of
resolving
employment
disputes.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
no,
i'm
not.
but--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but...
but
still
if
we...
if
we
go
forward
with
the
rule
that's
proposed
by
the
eeoc,
in...
in
my
view
we
will
be
flying
in
the
face
of
the
court's
decisions
in
gilmer,
the
court's
decision
in
circuit
city,
the
plain
text
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
we
will
be
discouraging
rather
than
encouraging
arbitration,
and--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--true,
and
if
you
take
a
step
back...
and
let's...
let's
take
the
more
general...
general
example
where
there...
there
hasn't
been
a
claim
filed
and
where
an
individual
is
having
a
dispute
with
his
employer.
and
the
employer
says,
i
will
give
you
$300
in
exchange
for
a...
a
settlement
agreement,
a
release
of
all
claims.
it
doesn't
involve
where
an
eeoc
charge
has
been
filed
or
where
there's
a
court
case
going
on.
the
eeoc
and
the
courts
take
the
position
that
that
particular
scenario
would
preclude
it
from
later
seeking
relief
on
behalf
of
that
individual
in
court.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
i
can't
accept
the
spectrum
analysis,
if...
if
i
may.
i
have
to
revert
to
the
fact
that...
that
the
individual
signed
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
once
signing
that
agreement
to
arbitrate,
then
he
must
pursue
his
individual
claims
in
that
forum
and
he
cannot
hand
off
the
ball
to
the
eeoc
and
have
the
eeoc
do
for
him
what
he
cannot
do
for
himself,
which
is
get
individual
relief
in
court.
that
was
the
bargain
that
waffle
house
made
with
this
employee.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
your
honor--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--under
the...
under
the
wage/hour
laws--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--there...
there
are
different
interests
there.
for
example,
the...
the
department
of
labor
has
to
approve
a
settlement
of
a
wage/hour
claim
because
of
the
public
policy
involved
in
making
sure
that
the
lowest
wage
earners
in
our
society
get
a
particular
wage.
it's
different
on
an
ada
claim,
for
example.
the
eeoc
does
not
have
to
approve
the
settlement
of
a
claim.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
equal
play
act
claim,
your
honor,
i
believe
would
be
covered
under
the
department
of
labor
scenario.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
yes.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
no,
it
would
not
where
there's
been--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--when
there's
been
an
arbitration
agreement.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
our
position
would
be,
your
honor,
that
for
those
individuals
who
have
signed
arbitration
agreements,
then
any
relief
specific
to
them
must
be
awarded
in
arbitration.
for
those
individuals
who
have
not
signed
arbitration
agreements,
then
that
eeoc
class-wide
relief
action
could
encompass
their
claim
for
relief
in
court.
but
to
give
force
to
the
arbitration
agreements
that
have
been
signed
by
the
individuals,
the...
the
general--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--the...
the
equitable
relief
specific
to
the
individual...
specific
to
the
individual--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--it
could
if
the
relief
was
broad-based
and
not--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--yes,
it
could,
but--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--but...
but...
well,
it
would
be
enforced
in
arbitration.
the
relief
specific
to
the
individual
would
be
enforced
in
arbitration.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
the
determination
would
be
in
court.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
well,
it
could,
your
honor.
in
court
a
determination
such
as
that
could
be
made
that
these
individuals
have
been
discriminated
against
and
therefore
remedies
are
available
to
them.
but
the
actual
determination
of
the
remedies
must
be
made
in
arbitration
for
those
individuals
who
signed
arbitration--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--the
determination
could
be
made
in
court,
but
the
determination
of
what
specific
equitable
relief,
whether
this
person
should
be
reinstated
or...
or
this
person
should
not,
that
should
be
made
in
arbitration.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
yes.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
that
would
be.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
well,
in
that
particular
case,
your
honor,
i
believe
there
would
be
contempt--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--of
the
injunction.
the
contempt
would
be
enforced
in
court.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
because
the
relief
that
is
awarded
to
a
particular
individual
is
awarded
in
arbitration.
assuming
that
relief
was
awarded,
then
that
would
probably
end
the
participation
of
the
arbitrator
at
that
point.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
your
honor,
the
court...
the
court
should
not
allow...
and
i
think
this
is
the
central...
central
theme
of...
of
our
argument
here.
the
court
should
not
allow
the
eeoc
and
its
charging
party
who
comes
to
it
with
an
arbitration
agreement
to
frustrate
the
purposes
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
by
making
this
end
run
around
the
agreement.
mr.
baker
entered
into
a
private
agreement
with
waffle
house
to
resolve
any
disputes
he
has
arising
out
of
his
employment.
the
court--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--well,
i
think
we
should...
should
take
account
of
what
the
eeo
still
is
able
to
do
under
the
fourth
circuit's
rule.
the
eeoc
is
still
able
to
effectuate
the
public
interest
by
seeking
broad-based
injunctive
relief.
the
eeoc
is
still
able
to
get
an
injunction
telling
an
employer
that
you
are
to
certain
things
with
the
way
you
run
your
business.
the
eeoc
still
has
the
opportunity
to
tell
an
employer
that
you
must
report
back
to
us
on
a
regular
basis
to
tell
us
how
you're
complying
with
the
employment
discrimination
laws.
injunctive
relief
is
not
a
toothless
remedy.
but
i
will...
i
will
say
one
other
thing.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
before
the
eeoc
brings
a
public--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--no,
your
honor.
it
could...
it
could
file
its
own
action
for
broad-based
injunctive
relief
if
it
wished.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
it
could
if
there
is
a
pattern
and
practice
involved
in
that
scenario.
mr.
david
l.
gordon
well,
if
there
is
a
policy,
for
example,
that
is
the
root
cause
of--
mr.
david
l.
gordon
--well,
in
that
case,
your
honor,
if
the
only...
if
i'm...
if
the
only
game
in
town
is
that
mr.
baker
was
discriminated
against,
and
that's
it,
and
there
are
no
general...
general...
there's
no
general
relief
being
sought,
we're
just
mad
about
the
employment
decision
directed
toward
him,
then
if
the
eeoc
was
in
court
just
on
that
theory
and
was
unable
to
show
any
broader
application,
then
that...
the
court
should
dismiss
that
case.
