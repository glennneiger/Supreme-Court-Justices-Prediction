that...
that
happens
to
be
in
this
case.
they
might
have
said
that.
doesn't
the
eeoc
also
pursue
a
public
interest?
i
mean,
can't
the
eeoc...
imagine
individuals
who
don't
want
to
bring
suits.
they
don't
care.
they're
cowed
or
they
just
don't
care.
and
the
eeoc
says,
i
don't
care
whether
you
want
to
bring
a
suit
or
not;
we're
bringing
it.
now,
isn't
that
part
of
the
eeoc's
job
to
see
that
employers
don't
discriminate?
and
isn't
there
a
public
interest
in
that,
as
well
as
the
private
interest?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
isn't
there
a
public
interest?
didn't
congress
set
this
statute
up
so
that
it
is
more
is
involved
than
a
simple
tort
action
or
a
simple
contract
action?
there's
a
public
policy
in
the
united
states
against
this
kind
of
discrimination
embodied
in
many
laws,
and
this
is
one
of
those
laws.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
question.
if
a
person
then
in
your
view
says
to
the
eeoc,
my
employer
discriminated
against
me
because
i'm
black
or
because
of
gender
or
whatever,
no
doubt,
but
i
like
peace;
i
don't
want
to
bother
him;
i'm
a
little
worried
about
it;
okay,
drop
it,
if
the
eeoc
says,
i
don't
want
to
drop
it,
do
they
not
have
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
talking
about
can
they
not
get
appropriate
relief.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not...
i'm
asking
you
my
question,
not
your
question.
i,
at
the
moment,
have
an
individual
who
doesn't
care,
doesn't
really
want
the
suit
brought,
says
to
the
eeoc
drop
it,
forget
it.
the
eeoc
says,
we
don't
want
to
forget
it.
there's...
i'm
just
repeating
myself.
so,
what's
the
answer
to
my
case?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not...
there
is
no
arbitration
agreement
in
my
case.
it's
a
person.
you're
quite
right.
as
soon
as
you
answer
my
question,
i'm
then
going
to
ask
you
why
does
it
matter
that
there's
an
arbitration
agreement.
[laughter]
but
i'd
like
you
to
start
with
my
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
person
is
lazy,
frightened,
or
whatever
and
says
to
the
eeoc,
i
don't
want
you
to
bring
this
action
to
get
me
reinstated.
forget
it.
drop
it.
i'm
indifferent.
does
the
eeoc
have
the
legal
power
to
say
we
don't
care?
we
have
a
public
interest
here.
we
want
to
bring
this
suit
anyway
because
we
don't
think
it's
right
for
the
employer
to
discriminate
against
you.
we
want
to
make
an
example
of
him.
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
can
do
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
now,
my
question
is,
when
they
can
do
that,
why
does
it
matter
if
there's
an
arbitration
agreement
since
once
you...
all
right.
go
ahead.
why
does
it
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
of
course,
my
example
is
designed
to
show
that
all
those
interests
have
to
do
with
the
private
interest
of
the
individual
perhaps.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--not
the
other.
that's
why
i
asked--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good.
that's
perfect.
that's
just
my
question.
why
is
this
arbitration
agreement
more
like
the
settlement
than
it
is
like
the
instance
we
both
agreed,
the
indifferent
employee?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
this
greater?
you
agreed
that
this
is
a...
this
is
the
greater,
the
arbitration.
the
way
i'm
seeing
it,
which
you
can
correct,
is
that
the
word
in
the
statute
is
appropriate
relief,
and
that
there's
a
spectrum.
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
the
indifferent
employee.
next
is
the
one
with
an
arbitration
agreement
who
doesn't
enforce
it.
next
is
the
one
who
is
in
the
middle
of
arbitration.
next
is
the
one
who
has
been
through
arbitration
and
gotten
some
money,
and
finally,
at
the
far
end
we
have
a
settlement.
and
whether
each
of
those
is
appropriate,
circumstances
for
the
eeoc
to
proceed
might
differ
one
from
the
other.
but
certainly
the
arbitration
case
is
in
the
middle.
it's
not
way
over
at
the
extreme.
so,
what...
what
is
your
response?
