mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
waffle
house
and
eric
baker
agreed
to
arbitrate
rather
than
litigate
disputes
between
them.
that
agreement
precludes
waffle
house
and
baker
from
having
an
action
take
place
between
them
in
court.
but
the
eeoc
was
not
a
party
to
that
agreement.
accordingly,
the
agreement
does
not
preclude
the
eeoc's
ability
to
bring
a
public
enforcement
action
against
waffle
house,
nor
does
it
limit
the
remedies
available
to
the
eeoc
in
such
an
action.
title
vii
gives
the
eeoc
a
public
enforcement
action
that's
independent
of
and,
in
many
respects,
superior
to
the
individual
employee's
cause
of
action.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
we
believe
the
government
would
still
have
a
cause
of
action
in
that
case,
though
we
admit
it
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
because
in
the
case
of
settlement,
of
course,
judicial
or
arbitral
resources
have
already
been
expended.
there's
an
agreement
of
the
parties
that
specifically
extinguishes
the
individual's
right--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the...
the
damages
could
go
to
the
individual.
i
think,
to
give
you
an
example
of
the
kind
of
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
right.
but
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
the
kind
of
case
we
have
in
mind,
and
it
may
help
illustrate
why
the
government
thinks
it
still
may
have
a
cause
of
action
in
that
situation.
if
you
can
imagine
a
case
where
an
employer
has
retaliated
against
an
employee
and...
simply
for
filing
a
charge
with
the
eeoc,
and
then
that
employee
settles
that
retaliation
claim
for
a
nominal
amount
of
money,
without
any
judicial
supervision,
let's
say,
it
may
be
that
in
that
kind
of
case,
the
eeoc
has
a
legitimate
public
interest
in,
nonetheless,
bringing
an
action,
getting
some
additional
amount
of
damages
to
really
take
the
employer--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
in
a
case
like
that,
i'm
sure
as
a
matter
of
its
prosecutorial
discretion,
the
eeoc
would
not
bring
that
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
in
that
case
i
think
they
would
have
cause
of
action.
but
again,
i
want
to
make
clear
that
we
think
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--a
much
more
difficult
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
that
would
follow.
but
again,
i
want
to
make
clear
that's
a
much
more
difficult
case
because
there
there's
been--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
let
me
do...
let
me
make
two
responses.
one,
let
me
try
one
more
time
to
defend
the
general
principle,
which
is
simply
that
congress
in
title
vii
gave
the
eeoc
a
distinct
cause
of
action,
and
so
the
extinguishment
of
the
individual
employee's
cause
of
action
shouldn't
automatically
extinguish
the
eeoc's
cause
of
action.
but
let
me
hone
in
on
why
i
think
that's
so
much
more
of
a
difficult
case
because
in
that
case,
the
individuals
settled
their
claim,
so
they
have
no
claim
to
damages
in
an
arbitration
proceeding.
and
so,
it
might
make
some
sense
to
say
that
the
eeoc
has
no
claim
to
damages
in
a
litigation
proceeding.
what
is
so
anomalous
about
the
decision
below
and
the
rule
that
respondent
seeks
in
this
case
is
that
it
seeks
to
limit
the
eeoc's
ability
to
get
victim-specific
remedies
in
court
even
though
those
victim-specific
remedies
are
available
to
the
employee
in
the
arbitration.
all
of
the
cases
that
respondent
cites--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
i
guess
i
do
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
they
would
still
have
a
cause
of
action
in
that
situation.
one
is
that
title
vii
does
give
the
eeoc
an
independent
cause
of
action.
it's
quite
a
remarkable
statute
in
that
respect.
it's
unlike
statutes
this
court
has
analyzed
in,
say,
the
newport
news
shipbuilder
case
where
it
specifically
contrasted
title
vii
as
being
the
rare
statute
that
gives
the
eeoc
a
duplicative
cause
of
action
to
the
individual.
the
second
reason,
though,
is
that
generally,
as
a
matter
of
privity,
res
judicata
principles,
the
reason
that
you
hold
one
party
in...
in...
to
a
judgment
that
they
didn't
participate
in
to
the
consequences
of
that
is
because
the
party
in
the
first
action
adequately
represented
the
interests
of
the
party
that
wasn't
present.
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--my
understanding
is
that
the
eeoc
picked
this
case
because
this
case...
the
events
here
took
place
in
1994.
so,
the
ada
was
still
quite
new
at
the
time
that
this...
that
this
case
took
place,
and
i
think
the
eeoc
was
concerned
that
employers
were
not
sure
of
what
their
obligations
under
the
ada
were.
so,
they
picked
this
case
to
litigate
to
help
establish
what
employers'
obligations
were
under
the
eeoc--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
fair
enough.
but
again,
congress
has
specifically
allowed
the
eeoc
to
use
its
modest
litigation
resources
to
vindicate
the
public
interest
both
in
pattern
and
practice
cases
or
cases
that
seek
injunctive
relief
and
victim-specific
cases
where
there's
some
aspect
of
the
case
that
helps
illustrate
an
important
principle
of
law.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
had
taken
the
import
of
the
hypothetical
as
being
that
the
individual
had
already
sued
and
settled
and
then,
only
after
that
had
taken
place,
that
the
eeoc
decided
to
initiate
a
duplicative
action.
but
your
question
certainly
highlights
the
anomaly
of
having
this
predispute
arbitration
agreement--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
absolutely
right.
the
statute
gives
the
eeoc
the
exclusive
right
to
initiate
a
cause
of
action
for
the
first
180
days
and
then,
for
an
extended
period,
until
a
right
to
sue
letter
issues.
and
that's
why
in
light
of
the...
the
congressional
determination
that...
that
eeoc
had
not
only
a
different
action,
but
one
that
took
primacy,
that
they
had
the
right
to
initiate
the
action
once
they
found
that
there
was
a
determination
that
the
suit
would
serve
the
public
interest,
it
seems
particularly--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
allow...
allow
me
to
make
two
responses.
one
is
it's
clear
that
under
the
ada
and
title
vii,
it's
not
that
the
eeoc's
filing
of
a
suit
simply
extinguishes
the
individual's
cause
of
action
entirely.
they...
the
individual
has
a
absolute
right
to
intervene
in
the
eeoc's
action.
so,
if
those
actions
were
100
percent
duplicative,
there
would
be
no
need
to
allow
the
individual
to
intervene
in
the
suit.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
mean--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
respectfully
disagree
because,
unlike
the
ada,
the
ada
does
not
make
the
eeoc
suit
the
exclusive
vehicle
and
extinguish
any
cause
of
action
or
any
basis
to
get
into
court
for
the
individual.
they
can
still
intervene
in
the
eeoc's
action.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
we
do
not
take
that
position.
to
the
contrary,
we
think
that
the
arbitration
agreement
does
preclude
in
this
case
mr.
baker
from
intervening
in
the
eeoc's
action.
and
i
think
that's
quite
a
persuasive
answer
to
the
argument
that
the
other
side
has
made
that
somehow
allowing
the
eeoc
to
sue
in
these
circumstances
renders
the
arbitration
agreement
a
dead
letter.
it
doesn't.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
may
be,
but
i
think
that
is
the
consequence
of
the
arbitration
agreement
and
the
implication
of
the
faa.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
even
if
you
disagree
with
me
on...
on
that
particular
point
and
you
say
that
the
faa
does
not
prevent
baker
from
intervening
on
this
action,
it's
still
true
that
the
arbitration
agreement
is...
has
a
meaningful
benefit
to
waffle
house
because
before
waffle
house
entered
that
arbitration
agreement
with
baker,
it
was
subject
to
a
suit
in
court
by
either
the
eeoc
or
baker.
the
agreement
with
baker
limited
baker
to
an
arbitral
forum.
but
absent
a
similar
agreement
with
the
eeoc,
waffle
house
has
simply
no
expectation
and
no
basis
to
keep
the
eeoc
out
of
court
or
to
limit
its
remedies
in
court.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
with
respect,
if
waffle
house
wants
to
stay
out
of
court,
then
it
needs
to
reach
an
agreement
with
every
party
that
has
a
statutory
right
to
get
them
into
court.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
i
still
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
and
we
think
there
are
good--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
i
do
not
think
it
is.
and
it's...
and
i
think
in
fact
the
text
of
title
vii
is
quite
clear.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
exactly
right,
and
that's...
that's
a
well-established
principle.
i
mean,
look
at...
look
at
firefighters
local
no.
93
against...
against
the
city
of
cleveland.
the
court
says
it's
a
fundamental
principle
that
a
settlement
cannot
bind
non-parties
to
the
litigation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
statutory
scheme
works
effectively
the
same.
there
are
independent
causes
of
action
given
to
the
government
entity
and
to
the
individual.
and
this
court
held
in
the
tony
and
susan
alamo
foundation
case
that
just
because
the
individual
forswears
a
cause
of
action
or
right
to
sue
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
that
does
not
preclude
the
secretary
of
labor
from
bringing
their
own
independent
action.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i...
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
true.
it's
certainly
not
going
to
be
true
in
every
case.
and
congress
specifically
made
all
forms
of
relief
available
to
the
eeoc
in
its
public
enforcement
action.
the
court
below
drew
a
distinction
between
equitable
relief
on
the
one
hand
and
victim-specific
relief
on
the
other
hand
to
avoid
a
perceived
conflict
with
the
faa.
but
with
respect,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
conflict.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
is
true,
but
i
don't
think
that
is
particularly
anomalous
or
limited
to
this
area
of
law.
take,
for
example...
i
mean,
this
court
has
held
that
an
individual
can
agree
to
arbitrate
his
or
her
civil
rico
claim.
i
wouldn't
think,
though,
that
that
agreement
to
arbitrate
the
civil
rico
claim
would
in
any
way
prevent
the
government
from
bringing
a
criminal
rico
action
or
prevent
the
government
from
getting
a
restitution
order
that
agreed
to
give
restitution
directly
to
the
victim.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
let's...
let's
take
this...
let's
make
it
parallel
to
this
case
where
the
individual--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
actually
they
could
get
the
order,
and
then
there
are
specific
provisions
in
the
federal
restitution
statute
that
allow
a
set-off
for
amounts
that
have
already
been
paid
or
that
will
be
paid.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
i
don't
think
it--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--again,
we
don't
think
the
agreement
is
binding,
but
let
me
give
you
three
reasons--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--let
me
give
you
three
reasons
why
i
think
it's
a
harder
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
okay.
let
me
give
you
three
reasons
why
i
think
the
settlement
case
is
more
difficult.
first,
there's
already
been
some
expenditure
of
resources
in
that
case,
either...
likely,
either
judicial
or
arbitral.
second,
title
vii
seems
to
place
particular
importance
on
the
eeoc's
ability
to
be
able
to
initiate
the
action
and
consider
the
early
stages
of
litigation.
if,
for
whatever
reason,
we've
gotten
to
the
point
where
somebody
has
filed
a
claim
and
it's
settled,
that
role
has
already
been
filled.
the
third
reason
is
another
particularly
important
function
of
the
eeoc
under
title
vii
is
to
act
as
a
safety
valve,
so
if
for
some
reason
the
individual
is
not
willing
or
able
to
sue,
maybe
out
of
a
fear
of
retaliation
or
something,
in
a
particular
case
that
vindicates
the
public
interest,
the
eeoc
has
the
ability
to
step
in
and
fill
that
gap.
if
there's
already
been
a
settlement--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
actually
think
there
is
a
reason
to
treat
that
one
agreement
different,
which
is
the
agreement
to
settle
a
case
extinguishes
any
claim
to
relief.
an
arbitration
agreement
does
not.
it's
simply
a
forum
selection
provision.
and
the
anomaly
of
the
fourth
circuit's
ruling
is
they
take
an
agreement
that
limits
baker's
access
to
a
judicial
forum,
but
does
not
limit
his
remedies
and
somehow
transmogrify
it
into
a
rule
that
limits
the
eeoc's
available
remedies
but
not
their
access
to
a
judicial
forum.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
again,
we
have
no...
absolutely
no
objection
to
having
the
agreement
bind
the
parties
to
the
agreement.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
actually
the
eeoc
is
of
the
opinion
that
the...
that
the
individual
could
bring
an
arbitration
action
at
that
point.
that
is
a
consequence,
though,
of
the
view
that
they
cannot
intervene
in
the
eeoc's
enforcement
action.
i
think...
i
think
they--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--they
have
to
have
one
action
or
the
other.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
equally,
of
course...
i
mean,
i...
i
agree
that
there
is
that
problem.
that
is
equally
a
problem
with
the
fourth
circuit's
rule,
of
course,
because
they
said
that
the
eeoc
could
be
in
court
seeking
general
injunctive
relief
while
the
individual
is
arbitrating
his
claim
for
victim-specific
relief.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but...
but
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and...
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
and...
and
i
think
that...
i
mean,
that
may
be
a
product
of...
that
happens
when
you
have
an
arbitration
agreement
that
limits
some
parties
but
not
others.
that
seems
to
be
the
case
in...
in
moses
cone.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
fair
enough.
but
in
this
case,
the
government
did
bring
suit
first.
baker
has
never
arbitrated.
so,
that
position
would
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
the
fourth
circuit
was
wrong,
that
the
eeoc
can
pursue
this
case,
seek
victim-specific
relief
and
general
injunctive
relief,
and
that
it's
up
to
you
to
determine
whether
or
not
baker
gets
to
intervene
in
that
action.
but
that
is...
that
is
certainly
a
result
that
the
government
is
quite
happy
with.
it
seems
to
me
what's
really
sort
of
indefensible
about
the
fourth
circuit's
reasoning
is
they
take
this
forum
selection
provision
and
turn
it
into
a
restriction
on
remedies.
the...
the
ada
and
title
vii
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
suppose
that
an
employer
and
an
employee
agreed
to
litigate
their
case
in
state
court,
not
federal
court.
it
wouldn't
seem
to
me
that
that
forum
selection
clause
would
bar
the
eeoc
and
bind
the
eeoc
and
limit
them
from
bringing
their
public
enforcement
action
in
federal
court.
it
certainly
wouldn't
seem
to
me
that
that
agreement
to
litigate
in
state
court
would
somehow
prevent
the
eeoc
from
getting
victim-specific
damages
in
federal
court
if
in
fact
there
was
no
state
court
action.
but...
but
in
principle,
there's
no
difference
between
the
arbitration
agreement
and
that
forum
selection
clause
agreement
that
picks
the
state
court.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
in
fairness,
i
don't
think
that
the
faa
embodies
a
self-executing
preference
for
arbitration.
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
that's
true.
but
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
faa,
as
i
understand
it,
was
to
put
arbitration
contracts
on
an
equal
footing
with
other
contracts,
not
to
give
them
some
special
private
place.
and
we
think
that
that
forum
selection
clause
that
picked
the
state
forum
would
be
enforceable
between
the
parties,
but
we
just
don't
think
it
makes
any
sense
to
say
that
that
agreement
between
the
parties
somehow
leaps
out
and
bars
the
eeoc
from
bringing
a
federal
enforcement
action,
or
even
more
puzzlingly
i
think,
restricting
the
remedies
available
to
the
eeoc
in
that
public
enforcement
action.
it
seems
to
me
that
at...
at
bottom
title
vii
gives
the
eeoc
a
right
to
bring
a
public
enforcement
action.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
fairness,
i
think
that's
a
position
that
congress
rejected
in
title
vii
itself.
if
congress
wanted
to
say
that
the
only
time
that
the
eeoc
vindicates
the
public
interest
is
when
it
seeks
general
injunctive
relief,
it
would
have
been
quite
easy
for
congress
to
limit
the
eeoc
to
general
injunctive
relief
or
limit
it
to
bringing
pattern
and
practice
cases.
instead,
it
gave
it
the
right--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--again,
with
all
respect,
i
disagree.
i
think
restitution
statutes
reflect
and
vindicate
the
public
interest,
even
though
the
restitution
goes
to
the
victim,
and
not
the
government.
it's
the
fact
that
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
absolutely
right.
i
mean,
every
time
a
wrongdoer
pays
money,
the
payment
of
that
money
serves
a
public
interest
that's
independent
of
the
destination
of
the
payment,
whether
it
goes
to
the
individual
who
was
wronged
or
some
sort
of
public
enforcement
action.
and
again,
i
suggest
the
example
of
a
retaliation
action.
in
a
retaliation
action,
when
an
employer
has
retaliated
against
an
employee
for
filing
a
charge
with
the
eeoc,
the
eeoc
clearly
vindicates
the
public
interest
when
it
files
suit
to
take
the
employer
to
task
for
the
retaliation.
and
that's
true
even
if
the
retaliation
and
the
most
effective
remedies
are
victim-specific.
in
a
case
like
that,
you
really
need
the
victim-specific
remedies
because,
after
all,
it
is
clear
as
day
from
title
vii
itself
that
an
employer
can't
retaliate
against
an
employee
for
filing
a
charge.
so,
to
simply
get
an
injunction
that
says
that
is
of
somewhat
limited
utility.
on
the
other
hand,
to
get
back
pay,
compensatory
and
capped
punitive
damages
i
think
does
vindicate
the
public
interest.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
guess
i
would
point--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes.
i
would...
i
would
direct
you
to
local
no.
93
v.
city
of
cleveland.
there's
a
statement
in
that
case
that
i
think
was
just
meant
to
reflect
a
general
principle
that
parties
to
a
litigation
can't,
through
a
settlement,
bind
a
non-party
to
the
litigation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'm
actually
aware
of
no
case
where
that's
happened.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
this
is
all
hypothetical.
and
what
we're
concerned
about
is
a
case
like
this
one
where
there
is
an
arbitration
agreement,
but
the
individual
has
never
even
sought
to
arbitrate.
i
think
that's
a
much
easier
case.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
first
pick
up
on
justice
souter's
hypothetical
about
the
contempt
proceeding.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
were
enforced
by
civil
compensatory
contempt,
rather
than
a
criminal
contempt
action
brought
by
the
u.s.
attorney,
that
he'd...
he'd
have
the
same
problem
at
the
end
of
the
day.
respondents
invoke
the
proposition
that
the
eeoc
has
to
take
the
victim
as
we
find
him.
the
problem
with
that
is
that
principle
applies
with
respect
to
damages
problems,
like
a
failure
to
mitigate,
that
apply
to
the
individual
employee
whether
or
not
he
arbitrates
or
litigates
and
applies
equally
to
an
eeoc
enforcement
action
and
to
the
individual
claim.
what's
so
unique
about
this
is
that
respondent
is
attempting
to
take
an
agreement
that
does
not
restrict
baker's
ability
to
get
any
remedy
in
the
arbitration
proceeding
and
turn
it
into
a
restriction
on
the
remedies
available
to
the
eeoc
in
its
action.
the
problem
is,
this
is
not,
at
bottom,
a
restriction
on
damages
or
a
problem
with
remedies.
it
is
a
forum
selection
clause.
and
you
have
a
statutory
structure
that
allows
two
people
to
initiate
an
action.
when
one
of
those
parties
has
signed
a
forum
selection
clause
and
hasn't
even
initiated
the
action,
it
seems
that
even
in
the
general
case
there
would
be
no
reason
to
restrict
the
other
party's
access
to
forums
or
their
remedies.
that
would
seem
to
be
a
fortiori
true
for
a
statute
like
title
vii
that
gives
the
eeoc
a
right
of
first
refusal
over
the
initiation
of
the
action.
another
point
i'd
like
to
emphasize
is
that,
as
justice
stevens
made
clear,
there
are
currently
no
suits
pending
against
employers
in
a
situation
where
there
has
been
a
previous
settlement.
in
fact,
there
are
only
450
suits
currently
in
the
entirety
of
the
eeoc's
docket,
and
i
think
that
puts
this
case
in
perspective.
in
the
literally
99
cases
out
of
100,
an
employer's
arbitration
agreement
will
govern
and
the
only
title
vii
claim
that
will
be
brought
is
the
employee's
claim
in
arbitration.
in
the
1
case
out
of
100,
in
the
extreme
case
where
there's
some
important
public
principle
at
stake
or
there's
particularly
egregious
conduct,
the
eeoc's
public
enforcement
action
serves
as
a
valuable
safety
valve
that
allows
it
to
preserve
the
possibility
of
precedent-setting
in
public
judicial
proceedings.
the
third
and
final
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
whatever
the
answer
is
in
the
settlement
context,
there's
absolutely
no
reason
to
take
a
restriction
that
only
restricts
the
available
forum
and
not
the
remedies
and
turn
it
into
a
restriction
on
remedies
but
not
the
forum.
here
respondent
seeks
not
only
to
bind
the
eeoc
to
the
results
of
an
arbitration,
but
to
prevent
the
eeoc
from
seeking
all
remedies
even
when
there
hasn't
been
any
arbitration
proceeding
initiated
at
all.
for
those
reasons,
we
ask
you
to
reverse.
