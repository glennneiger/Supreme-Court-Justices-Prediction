mr.--
justice

do
you
think
it
is...
do
you
think
it
is
going
to
be
very
comfort
to
waffle
house
to
know
that,
yes,
it
can't
be
sued
in
court
by
the
individual,
but
the
entire
prosecutorial
power
of
the
united
states
can
be
brought
to
bear
on
it
in...
in
a
suit
in
court?
what
waffle
house
wants
to
do
is
to
stay
out
of
court,
and
that's
what
they're
getting
at
when
they
talk
about
undercutting
the...
the...
in
effect,
the
arbitration
agreement.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
think
your
answer
has
got
to
be
that
the
settlement
clearly
does
not
bind
the
government.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then
let's
go
back...
then
let's
simply
go
back
to
the
damages
case.
you
said
a
second
ago
in...
in
response
or
you...
you
agreed
with
the
suggestion
of
mine
that
in
fact
the
government
can
perfectly
well
sue
independently.
my
question
then
is,
why
do
you
concede
that
the
settlement
case
in
which
the
individual
settles
for...
for
money
in
lieu
of
damages
is
a
harder
case?
why
don't
you
say
no?
it's
just
as
easy
as
this
is.
and...
and
in
neither
case
is
the
agreement
between
the
individual
and
the
defendant
binding
or
affecting
in
any
way
what
the
government
can
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why...
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
did
say
earlier
that
you
thought
the
settlement
case
more
difficult.
so,
i
guess
i
want
you
to
explain
why
you
think
it
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
in
each
of
the...
in
each
of
the
cases
that
you
posit,
even
the
third
one,
the...
the
essence
of
the
objection
to
your
position
is
that
an
agreement
has
been
made
between
the
individual
and
the
defendant.
and
in
the
case
of
the
arbitration
agreement,
an
agreement
has
been
made
between
the
individual
and
the
defendant.
and
i
don't
see
why
the
one
class...
the
one
kind
of
agreement
should
be
treated
any
differently
from
the
other
kind
of
agreement
in
determining
whether
the
government
really
is
in
an
autonomous
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
your
objection
is
the
transmogrification,
not
to
the...
not
to
the
recognition
of
the
agreement
as
such.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
gordon,
may
i
just
ask
you
a
question
sort
of
about
the
other
end
of
this
case?
let's
assume
that...
well,
let's
assume
that
there
are
parallel
proceedings
going
on
and
that
the
eeoc
suit
comes
to
resolution
first.
now,
you...
you
are...
you
at
least
agree
that
the...
that
the
eeoc
can
get
what
i
think
you
have
described
as
sort
of
generalized
equitable
remedies
on...
on...
in...
in
the
public
interest.
would
those
remedies...
let's...
let's
assume
a
case
in
which
the
eeoc
sues
on
behalf
of
the
individual
who
is
subject
to
the
particular
arbitration
agreement,
say,
in
this
case,
but
also
brings
in
a...
in
effect,
a...
a
class-wide
claim
and
said,
you
know,
there
are...
we'll
prove
that
there
are
hundreds
of
other
individuals
who
have
suffered
the
same...
what
is
it...
title
i
violation
that
this
individual
suffered.
can
the...
and
let's
assume
that
in...
in
the...
the
eeoc
suit,
that
they
prove
that.
can
the
eeoc
get
generally
class-wide
remedy
as...
as
part
of
its
general
equitable
relief?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
that
include
back
pay?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
not
back
pay
for
this
individual.
back
pay
for
everybody
in
the
class
except
this
individual.
this
is
just...
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
position
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
then...
then
i...
is
it
also
your
position
that
the...
that
the
general
equitable
relief
could
not
include
an
injunction
to
rehire
all
of
those
who
were
improperly
fired?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
injunction
is
just
a
general
injunction.
it
says,
rehire
the
people
in
this
class
whom
you
unlawfully
fired
in...
in
violation
of
this
title.
can...
can
they
get
that
relief
on
your
theory?
can
the
eeoc
get
that
relief
on
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
my
example,
it's
broad-based
in
the
sense
that
it
applies
to
everyone
in
the
class,
but
in
order
to
enforce
it,
it
will
have
to
be
enforced
against
specific
individuals.
somebody
quite
apart
from
this
proceeding
will
come
forward
and
say,
i'm
one
of
them.
you've
got
to
rehire
me.
can
the
injunction
be...
be
enforced
in
that
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
can't
back
pay
be
enforced
in
that
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
you...
if
i...
if
i
understood
what
you
just
said...
maybe
i
didn't...
the...
the
injunction
to
rehire
those
who
were
improperly
fired
could
be
enforced
in...
in
court.
in
other
words,
there's
an
injunction
and
a
court
that
issued
the
injunction
can
enforce
it.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then
why...
why
would
not
a
similar
determination
and
a
similar
power
effect
a
back
pay...
generalized
back
pay
order?
give
back
pay
to
all
of
those...
not
this
guy,
but
to
all
of
those
in
the
class
generally
who
were
improperly
fired.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
can
understand
why
you
say
that,
but
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
that
a...
a
general
equitable
order
to
rehire
could
be
enforced
in
court
and
would
not
have
to
be
remitted
to
an
arbitral
forum.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
in...
the
only
thing
that
on
your
theory
then
that
is
totally
within
the
control
of
the
court
would
be
totally
prospective
relief,
e.g.,
an
order,
don't
do
this
again
for
anybody.
that
would
be
enforceable
in
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
purely
in
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
let's
say...
let's
say
a
claim
is
made
then
later
on
that
that
order
has
been
violated,
that
the
title
has
been
violated
again,
and
the
injunction
against
violating
the
title
has
been...
has
been
violated.
and
let's
assume
that
the
employee
who
claims
that...
that
he
is
the
subject
of
that
violation
has
also
signed
an
arbitration
agreement.
does
it
have
to
go
to
arbitration?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
isn't
your...
why
isn't
your
claim
to
the
vindication
of
the
arbitration
agreement
the
same
in
the
future
case
as
it
was
in
the
past
case?
