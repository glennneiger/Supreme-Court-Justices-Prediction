justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
clement,
may
i
ask
you
to
back
up
on
how
we
would
get
to
the
point
of
having
a
settlement
after...
or
an
arbitral
determination?
i
thought
when
the
eeoc
sues,
then
the
individual
has
no
right
to
come
to
court,
that
eeoc
would
be
the
exclusive
litigator.
and
so,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the...
the
individual
employee
couldn't
bring
a
suit,
a
rival
suit,
in...
in
court.
doesn't
that
extend
to
arbitration
as
well?
i
thought
that
the...
giving
the
primacy
to
the
eeoc
meant
it
would
control
this
entire
claim
in
all
of
its
aspects,
but
you
answered
the
question
as
though,
even
though
the
eeoc
had
filed,
the
employee
could
go
on
on
a
separate
track.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
the
individual
bring
a
suit?
i
mean,
is
the...
within
the
180
days,
doesn't
eeoc
have
total
control?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
this
compare
with
the
fair
labor
standards
act
where
the
secretary
of
labor
could
sue
or
the
individual
could
sue,
say,
for
a
wage
and
hour
violation?
or
let's
take
a
violation
of
the
equal
pay
act.
how...
how
does
that
work
when
the
secretary
brings
a
suit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
do
say
that
the
employee
could
not
proceed
even
in
the
arbitral
forum
once
the
eeoc
starts.
it's
clear
in
the
statute
that
that's
true
as
to
a
court
action,
but
you
i
thought
agreed
with
me
that
the
employee,
once
the
eeoc
starts,
can't
go
into
the
arbitral
forum
either.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
then
the
eeoc--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--says
we
can
have
this...
we
can
have
this...
you've
just
told
us
that
the
substantive
law
is
the
same.
and
i
think
you're
quite
right
about
that,
and...
and
it's
just
a
question
of
which
forum.
but
now
you're
saying
it
can
be
both
forums
simultaneously.
the
individual
can
go
forward
in
the
arbitration;
the
eeoc
can
go
forward
in
the
court
with
all
the
problems
that
duplicative
litigation
can
have
of
potentially
conflicting
results.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
model...
if
the
model
is
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
antedated
these
discrimination
acts
by
many
years,
where
the
secretary
can
sue
for
the
money
to
go
into
the
pocket
of
the
employee,
i
thought
that
those
were
characterized
as
public
interest
actions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gordon,
but
that's
so
highly
hypothetical
because
the
likelihood
that
the
employee
would
have
proceeded...
if
the
eeoc
in
the
beginning
is
the
only
one
who
can
bring
an
action
in
court,
eeoc
brings
an
action.
now,
even
if
it's
limited
only
to
injunctive
relief,
isn't
it
clear
that
the
basic
finding
of
fact,
was
there
discrimination,
has
to
be
made
for
any
kind
of
relief.
and
are
you
going
to
permit
a
viable
set
of
proceedings
to
determine
that
question?
once
the
eeoc
brings
in...
the
case
in
court,
mustn't
its
suit
be
given
primacy
to
determine
the
basic
question,
was
there
discrimination
in
violation
of
the
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
because
one
of
them
has
power
to
bind
the
other.
does
it
not?
i
mean,
suppose
the
eeoc
proceeds
and
there
is
a
finding
that
discrimination,
unlawful
under
the
statute,
occurred.
that
would
be
binding
on
the
employer
in
any
other
forum,
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we're
not
talking
about
mr.
baker.
we're
talking
about
the
employer
who
has
been
found
to
have
been
a
discriminator.
that
would
have
issue
preclusive
effect
against
the
employer
in
any
other
forum.
we're
not
talking
about
the
individual
now,
but
we're
talking
about
the
employer
who
has
been
found
to
be
a
discriminator
in
a
federal
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
other
way
around,
if
the
arbitrator,
say,
finds
no
discrimination
in
that
arbitration
forum,
couldn't
bind
the
eeoc
because
the
eeoc
wasn't
party
to
that
litigation.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's...
let's
cut
out
the
relief
aspect
of
it
and
again
concentrate
on
the
issue,
was
there
discrimination
or
not,
as
to
which
there
might
be
injunctive
remedies.
if
mr....
mr.
baker
loses
on
that,
that
can't
preclude
the
eeoc
from
getting
the
determination,
was
there
discrimination.
so,
the
only
point
i'm
making
is
when
you've
got
one
show
that
will
be
binding
and
the
other
that
can't
preclude
the
eeoc
from
litigating
that
basic
question,
whatever
remedies
would
attach
to
it,
doesn't
it
follow
that
the
eeoc's
suit
must
be
allowed
to
go
forward
and
have
the
question
of
discrimination
determined
in
that
forum?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it
true
that
for
any
relief,
there
must
be
a
finding
that
the
employer
has
violated
the
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
against
a
particular
person.
i
thought
the
basic
principle
of
preclusion
was
that
someone
who
has
not
litigated
cannot
be
bound.
you
would
have
to
establish
that
there
was
some
kind
of
privity
between
the
employee
and
the
eeoc,
but
i
think
that
would
be
certainly
unprecedented.
the
main
rule
is
you
have
a
right
to
a
day
in
court,
not
two
days
in
court,
and
if
the
eeoc
has
not
been
a
party
in
the
arbitral
forum,
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
bound,
unless
you're
making
up
some
new
preclusion
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
remedy...
i
think
we've
agreed
that
what
we're
not
talking
about
here
is
the
substantive
law...
the
substantive
right
and
the
remedy.
it
is
simply
a
choice
of
forum
clause.
and
if
you
have
two
parties
that
have
a
substantive
right,
who
can
assert
the
substantive
right,
one
of
them
is
bound
by
a
choice
of
forum
clause.
that's
where
that
party
must
go.
and
the
other
one
is
not
so
bound.
then
how
do
you
stop
the
eeoc
from
choosing
its
forum?
the
same
question
with
respect
to
suppose
it
had
been
a
state
human
rights
commission
that
is
going
into
the
state
court,
and
the
employer
says,
no,
state
human
rights
commission,
you
can't
do
that
because
this
employee
has
signed
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
you...
procedural
mode,
but
do
you...
you
don't
contest,
do
you,
that
title
vii
or
the
disability
act
or
the...
whatever
federal
law
is
the
law
that
the
arbitrator
is
to
apply
so
that
the
substantive
law
to
be
applied,
whether
you're
in
court
or
in
arbitration,
is
the
same?
it
would
be
title
vii.
it
would
be
the
disabilities
act.
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
arbitrator
can
apply
some
other
brand
of
federal
law
than
the
federal
court
would
apply,
are
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
we're
talking
about
the
forum
and
forums
have
rules
of
procedure,
which
can
be
different,
but
the
substantive
law
is
the
same.
it
is
title
vii
or
the
disabilities
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
that
carry
over
to,
say,
wage
and
hour
claims?
equal
pay...
i
guess
the
equal
pay
act
is
the
closest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
the
secretary
of
labor
also
be
in
privity
with
the
individual
employee
who
hasn't...
who
has
been
denied
equal
pay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
an
equal
pay
act
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gordon,
in...
in
the
history
of
the
anti-discrimination
acts,
there
was
legislative
history
that
said
the
eeoc
should
be
the
main
player;
that
is,
they
should
be
the
main
enforcer
of
these
anti-discrimination
laws.
now,
that
model,
which
would
have
taken
a
lot
more
money
than
congress
has
appropriated
to
carry
out...
but
that
model
simply
could
not
be
realized
under
your
view
of
things
because
the
federal
arbitration
act
would
always
take
primacy,
i
think
you...
you
put
it.
but
the
notion
that
the
eeoc
ought
to
be
running
these
discrimination
actions...
they
are
the
main
show,
and
then
the
individual
actions
can
supplement
that.
but...
but
you
couldn't
have
that
model
effected
under
your
view
of
it
because
the
arbitration
agreement
could
always
come
in
and
interfere
with
it.
