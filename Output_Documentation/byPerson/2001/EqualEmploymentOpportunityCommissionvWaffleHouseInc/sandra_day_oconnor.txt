day
o'connor
well,
here
we
have
a
case
where
the
employee
did
not
settle,
but
we
were
really
discussing
with
you
the
possibility
not
presented
in
this
case
of
a
full
settlement
or
a
judgment
in
arbitration,
disposing
of
the
victim-specific
relief,
and
asking
you
why
then
should
eeoc
continue
to
have
a
cause
of
action
for
the
victim-specific
relief,
as
opposed
to
broad
injunctive
relief,
to
address
the
overall
problem.
