justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's...
that's
a
separate
wrong.
i
don't
know
if
that's
a
really
fair
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question.
if
there's
retaliation,
i...
i
would
think
that's
a
separate
component.
but
just
suppose
a
case
with
no
retaliation.
the...
the
employee
recovers
$10,000
and
then
the
eeoc
can
recover
$20,000
more?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
say
the
prosecutor
doesn't
exercise
his
discretion
that
way
that
day.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what...
and
what
happens--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
would
happen...
what
would
happen
if
the
employee
recovered
$10,000
in
the
arbitration,
then
only
$5,000
in
the
litigation?
does
he
have
to
give
$5,000
back?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
we're
asking
what
the...
what
the
logical
consequences
of...
of
your
position
are,
and
that's
why
we're
putting
the
more
difficult
case
so
we
can
test
the
general
proposition.
and
the
general
proposition,
it
seems
to
me,
has
to
withstand
some
analysis
under
these
more
difficult
instances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
very
strange
use
of
the
article
iii
courts
to
have
litigation
proceeding
in
which
one
of
the
real
parties
in
interest
is
not
permitted
to
intervene.
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
strikes
me
as
a...
a
distortion
of
the
whole
case
in
controversy
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it
is
a
distortion
of
the
case
in
controversy
rule,
then
we're
in
real
trouble,
aren't
we?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
are
your
best
authorities
for
the
proposition
that
when
litigation
has
been
concluded,
another
party
can
recommence
the
litigation
alleging
its
own
injury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--some
other
areas.
you
cited
the
firefighters
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
was
because
the
other
parties
had
their
own
injury
of
a
pecuniary
nature,
as
i
recall
the
case.
i...
i
don't
see
the
case
cited.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what...
what
is
your
position...
maybe
you've
answered
this.
what
is
your
position
if
the
employer
and
the
employee
arbitrate
and
there's
a
finding
of
no
liability,
no
wrong
on...
no
wrong
committed
by
the
employer?
the
eeoc
then
sues.
is
the
eeoc
not
bound
by
the
liability
finding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
my
hypothetical
is
the
arbitrator
rules
for
the
employer.
no
discrimination.
there
was
no
firing
in
violation
of
the
ada.
the
employer
was
taking...
the
employee
was
taking
money
or
something.
that...
that
was
the
reason.
can
the
eeoc
then
re-litigate
the
issue
of
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
why...
and
why
is
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
that
the
employer
cannot...
that
the
eeoc
cannot
re-litigate
the
raw
finding
of
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear
what
your
position
is.
is
it
your
position
that
when
the
eeoc
sues
in...
in
the
federal
court
and
there
has
been
a
previous
finding
of...
of
non-liability
on
the
part
of
the
employer,
that
the
employer
did
not
discriminate
against
this
person,
is
the
eeoc
bound
in
court
by
that
finding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it's
not.
suppose
it's
just
interested
in
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--employee
and
it's
going
to
base
the
injunction
on
the
wrong
that
the
employer
allegedly
committed
against
this
employee,
but
the
arbitrator
has
found
that
there
is
no
such
violation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what's
your
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
unless
you
say
the
statutory
scheme
necessarily
finds
that
there
is
privity
because
the
eeoc's
interests
in
this
case,
where
there's
no
broad
pattern
or
practice,
are
allied
solely
with
those
of
the...
of
the
employee.
but
it's...
it's
a
little
odd
to
say
that
a
party
in
privity
is...
is
bound
if
that
party
cannot
intervene
in
those
proceedings
when
it's
a
public
agency.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
has
to
be
your...
your
proposition.
