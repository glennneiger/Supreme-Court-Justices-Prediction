as
a
practical
matter,
how
often
does
the
eeoc
seek
victim-specific
relief
in
the
form
of
monetary
damages
after
there's
been
a
settlement
between
the
victim
and
the
other
side?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
all
a
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
very
well,
mr.
clement.
mr.
gordon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gordon,
if
i
understood
him
correctly,
he
did
take
that
position,
but
he
said
you
don't
have
to
take
that
position
to
prevail
in
this
case.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
it
presents
a
question
whether
an
arbitration
agreement
between
an
employer
and
an
employee
prevents
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
from
pursuing
victim-specific
relief,
in
other
words,
reinstatement
backpay
and
damages
in
an
enforcement
action
brought
in
court.
when
eric
baker
applied
for
a
job
as
a
grill
operator
in
one
of
the
waffle
house
restaurants,
he
signed
an
agreement
that
“any
dispute
or
claim”
concerning
his
employment
would
be
settled
by
binding
arbitration.
after
he
started
working,
baker
suffered
a
seizure
and
soon
thereafter
was
discharged.
he
did
not
initiate
arbitration
proceedings
nor
has
he
done
so
in
the
seven
years
since
his
termination.
baker
did
however
file
a
charge
of
discrimination
with
the
eeoc.
after
an
investigation
and
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
conciliate,
the
eeoc
filed
suit
against
respondent
in
federal
district
court
seeking
an
injunction.
bakers’
reinstatement
with
backpay
and
damages
for
violations
of
americans
with
disabilities
act.
respondent
then
field
a
petition
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
seeking
the
stay
the
eeoc
sued
and
to
compel
arbitration.
the
district
court
denied
the
petition,
but
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
applying
a
balancing
test
held
that
the
eeoc
was
precluded
from
seeking
victim-specific
relief
because
the
federal
policy
favoring
arbitration
outweighs
the
eeoc’s
interest
in
vindicating
baker’s
private
interest.
injunctive
relief
would
still
be
avaiable
under
the
court
of
appeals’
rule
because
in
that
context
the
eeoc
is
protecting
the
interest
of
employees
generally,
but
all
other
relief
would
be
barred
in
order
to
give
full
effect
to
the
arbitration
agreement.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse
and
remand.
the
court
of
appeals
policy
judgment
might
be
persuasive
if
it
were
true
that
the
eeoc
could
prosecute
its
frame
only
with
baker’s
consent
or
if
baker
dictated
the
eeoc’s
prayer
for
relief,
but
the
exact
opposite
is
true
under
the
statute.
after
the
commission
filed
suit,
the
employee
has
no
independent
course
of
action,
although,
he
may
intervene
in
the
eeoc’s
suit.
the
statute
expressly
authorizes
the
eeoc
to
seek
an
injunction,
reinstatement
with
or
without
backpay
and
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
not
a
word
in
the
statutory
provision
was
giving
the
eeoc
litigating
authority,
or
in
any
of
our
cases
suggest
that
the
mere
existence
of
an
arbitration
agreement
between
private
parties
qualifies
that
authority,
nor
does
the
federal
arbitration
act,
which
of
course
was
enacted
long
before
the
eeoc
was
created,
impose
any
limits
on
the
eeoc’s
authority.
that
statute
was
intended
to
place
arbitration
agreements
on
the
same
footing
as
other
contracts,
not
to
extend
them
beyond
their
term.
although
we
have
held
that
the
faa
manifest
a
liberal
policy
favoring
arbitration,
we
have
also
held
that
it
is
the
language
of
the
arbitration
agreement
that
defines
the
scope
of
the
arbitration.
the
act
does
not
authorize
a
court
to
compel
arbitration
of
any
issues
or
by
any
parties
not
covered
in
the
agreement.
the
eeoc
of
course
was
not
a
party
to
the
agreement
between
baker
and
waffle
house.
in
sum,
this
is
a
case
in
which
a
straightforward
reading
of
the
unambiguous
text
of
the
relevant
statutes
supports
the
position
of
the
eeoc.
justice
thomas
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
