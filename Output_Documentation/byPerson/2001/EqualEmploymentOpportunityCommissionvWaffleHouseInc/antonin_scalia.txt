mr.
clement,
suppose
the
individual
employee
had
settled
with
the
employer,
not
just
an
agreement
to
arbitrate,
but
there
had
been
a
complete
settlement.
they
said,
you
know,
in
exchange
for
so
much
money,
i
waive
any
cause
of
action
i
had.
would
the
government
still
has...
have
a
cause
of
action
for
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
the
damages?
the
government
gets
damages
that
have
already
been
paid
to
the
individual
to...
i
don't
understand.
and
these
damages
go
to
the
individual?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
if
he'd
settle
and
get
the
damages,
and
then...
and
then
he'd
get
additional
damages
recovered
for
him
by
the
eeoc.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
they...
once
they
do
initiate
the
action,
though,
the
individual
cannot
also
bring
an
action.
right?
so,
what
you're
saying
is
that
the...
that
the
eeoc
suit
is
independent
of
the
individuals,
but
somehow
the
individual
suit
is
not
independent
of
the
eeoc's.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
i...
i
don't
know
why
you
think
that
cuts
in
your
favor
rather
than
against
you.
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
structure
of
the
thing
indicates
that
there's
one
cause
of
action.
it
can
be
brought
by
the
eec
or
by
the
individual,
but
not
by
both.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
by
both
successfully,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
one
statutory
right
is
derivative
of
the
other.
i
mean,
that's
the...
that's
the
whole
issue
in
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you...
you
keep
saying
the
government
has
an
independent
right
to
sue,
but
you
know,
that
begs
the
question.
that...
that's
the
whole
issue.
it
is
given
a
right
to
sue,
but
is...
is
that
right
to
sue
derivative
of
the
individual's
right
so
that
it
disappears
when
the
individual's
does?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
had
already
recovered?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i'm
assuming
a
rico
victim
who's
already
been...
been
compensated,
and
you
think
the
government
can
bring
a
rico
action
in
which
it
gets
not
just
criminal
sanctions
but
also
requires
the...
the
rico
defendant
to
pay
again
what's
already
been
paid.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
well,
that's
quite
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
doesn't
strike
me
as
so
terrible.
i
mean,
that...
that's
entirely
understandable.
you
have
two
different
types
of
relief
being
sought
in
two
different
forums.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
justice
ginsburg
points
out
is...
is
the
anomaly
of...
of
the
same
relief
being
sought
in
two
different
forums.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
if
we
adopt
your
view
of
the
thing,
that
the
two...
that
the
two
are
independent.
if...
if
the
two
are
dependent,
as
the
statute
makes
very
clear
they
are
when...
when
the
government
brings...
brings
the
suit
first,
barring...
barring
the
individual
from
bringing
a
separate
suit,
if
the
two
are...
are
dependent,
then
you
don't
face
any
of
these
problems.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
trouble
is
it's
not
a
public
enforcement
action
to
the
extent
that
it
is
seeking
damages
for
this
individual.
to
that
extent,
it...
it's
an
action
that
seeks
to
compensate
this
individual
for
the
damage
he
has
suffered.
now,
that...
that
has
some
public
benefit
i...
i
assume,
just
as
his
own
suit,
should
he
recover,
would
have
such...
some
public
benefit.
but
to
call
it
a
public
enforcement
action
seems
to
me
quite
unrealistic.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
that
would
have
been
very
foolish.
why...
why
require
two
separate
suits:
one...
one
by
the
private
individual,
the
other
by
the...
by
the
agency?
if
the
agency
is
going
to
be
in
there,
it
may
as
well
go
for
the
whole
ball.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
to
say
that
the
portion
of
it
that
compensates
the
individual
is
essentially,
you
know,
a
vindication
of
the
public
doesn't
seem
to
me...
doesn't
seem
to
me
reasonable.
and...
and
that
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
if
the
agency
brings
the
suit,
the
individual
can't
because
he's
going
to
be
getting
his
individual
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
eeoc
is...
is
effectively
a
party
to
the
earlier
proceeding
since
its
right
in
the
later
proceeding
is
purely
derivative
of
the
right
of...
of
the
individual
employee.
that's
essentially
what
you're
urging.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gordon--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think...
i
think
it
is
your
position,
is
it
not,
that
the...
that
the
agency
would
not
be
able
to
bring
such
a
suit
if
the
individual
had
already
sued
and
had
been
compensated,
or
indeed,
if
the...
if
the
individual
had
already
settled?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
your
further
position
is
that
the...
that
the
conclusion
of
an
arbitration
agreement
is
similar
to
a
settlement,
that
the
agency's
ability
to
bring
the
later
suit
depends
on
what
the
individual,
on
whose
behalf
it
sues,
has
given
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr....
mr.
gordon,
i
assume
that
giving
up
the
whole
cause
of
action
is
the
greater
and
giving
up
the
forum
is
the
lesser.
isn't
your
response
that
if...
if
the
eeoc
is
bound
by
a
settlement
agreement,
a
fortiori
it
should
be
bound
by
an
agreement
only
to
bring
the
suit
in
a
particular
forum,
if
indeed
its
action
is
derivative
of
the
individual's
action.
the
greater
includes
the
lesser,
and
surely
giving
up
the
whole
cause
of
action,
if
that
binds
the
eeoc,
is
greater
than
giving
up
simply
the
forum
in
which
the
cause
of
action
can
be
brought.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
contempt
action
wouldn't
be
brought
by
either
the
eeoc
or...
or
the
individual,
i
assume.
it
would
be
brought
by
the
united
states
attorney
or,
as
we
have
said,
some
attorney
appointed
by
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
does
it
have
to
wait
for
the...
for
the
arbitration
to
be
completed
before
it
brings
such
a
suit?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
it
brings
such
a
suit
based
upon
the
violation
against
an
employee
who
has
signed
an
arbitration
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
injunctive
relief
based
upon
the
violation
that
is
the
same
subject
as
the
arbitration
proceeding.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine.
it
says
that
policy
is
reflected
in
this
one
instance,
and...
and
it's
the
same
instance
that's...
that's
before
arbitration.
what
happens?
