we'll

argument
now
in
no.
99-1823,
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
v.
waffle
house,
inc.--
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
did
the
eeoc
decide
to
get
into
this
case?
is
there
some
sort
of
a
pattern
or
practice
involved
that
goes
beyond
this
individual
establishment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is...
this
is
not
any
broad
pattern
or
practice.
this
is
simply
honing
in
on
an
individual
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you're
saying
that
if
the
eeoc
brings
an
action
in
circumstances
such
as
this,
an
individual
who
has
agreed
to
arbitrate
the
claim
can
intervene
and
not
be
bound?
the
individual
is
not
bound
by
the
arbitration
agreement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
the...
the
cause
of
action
for...
that
eeoc
has
could
be
vindicated
by
an
equitable
remedy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
this
case
then
you
say
eeoc
can
go
into
court
and
that
baker
can
probably
not...
not
intervene,
but
the
eeoc
could
get
whatever
he
could
have
gotten
and
give
it
to
him.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
there's
a
federal
arbitration
act,
and
we've
said
it's
designed
to
encourage
arbitration
of
disputes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but...
a...
a
favoring
where
the...
where
an
arbitration
agreement
has
been
entered
into,
as
it
was
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gordon.
mr.
clement,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.

waffle
house
will
