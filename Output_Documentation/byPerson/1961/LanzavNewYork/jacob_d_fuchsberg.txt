mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
for
a
brief
moment
to
go
back
to
a
question
asked
by
judge
brennan
and
judge
harlan
with
respect
to
the
divisibility
of
the
various
questions,
and
just
point
out
the
following
to
the
court.
i
think
aside
from
the
argument
that
mr.
pfeffer
made
to
the
effect
that
there
was
--
there
seemed
to
be
no
justification
except
through
a
dragnet
procedure
for
any
inquiry
of
harry
lanza
and
therefore
the
two
questions
that
are
sought
to
be
separated
from
the
other
--
from
the
other
17
would
not
themselves
be
properly
asked.
i
think
we
also
cannot
take
them
and
separate
them
unofficially
because
by
the
familiar
principles
of
the
doctrine
of
ejusdem
generis,
we
must
judge
the
intent
of
the
first
and
19th
question,
the
two
general
questions
in
the
light
of
the
specific
things
asked
in
the
other
17
which
indicate
that
the
first
and
19th
so-called
omnibus
questions
of
necessity
must
have
had
reference
to
and
be
motivated
by
the
specific
matter
that's
inquired
into
by
the
other
17.
now
you
see,
if
your
honors
please,
the
order
in
which
the
questions
were
put
to
the
witness
are
really
of
little
significance
for
this
reason.
they
were
put
to
mr.
lanza
on
three
different
occasions.
the
19
questions
were
put
to
him
and
the
occasion
of
the
first
inquiry
by
the
committee.
and
at
that
time,
he
was
not
offered
immunity.
now,
when
he
was
recalled
to
the
committee,
at
that
time,
he
was
offered
immunity
and
asked
to
answer
all
19
questions.
so
as
a
result,
he
knew
by
reason
of
the
17
questions
to
follow
the
first
one,
what
the
first
one
and
the
19th
one
were
leading
to
and
therefore,
to
attempt
to
separate
the
first
and
19th
from
all
the
other
17,
when
there
isn't
the
slightest
information.
and
i
will
go
back
to
the
testimony
given
by
the
counsel
for
the
committee
in
just
a
moment
that
these
things
can
be
broken
asunder
unless
we
would've
take
a
patently
artificial
approach.
now
mr.
bauman,
the
attorney
for
the
committee
when
he
was
called
to
testify
and
its
very
interesting
to
see
while
he
does
make
the
pat
statement
that
rather
boldly,
that
the
first
and
19th
questions
were
not
necessarily
based
upon
the
eavesdropping
through
the
electronic
device.
it's
interesting
to
note
the
language
he
uses
which
is
quoted
by
us
--
which
is
quoted
at
page
9
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york's
brief.
when
he's
asked
is
--
were
--
whether
any
of
those
questions
were
unrelated
to
the
eavesdropping,
the
first
words
he
uses
were,
“i
think
some
of
the
questions
were
based
upon
the
recordings.”
it's
obviously
a
rationalization.
and
then
in
the
immediately
following
question,
this
is
on
page
9
of
the
brief
to
which
i
referred
and
that's
at
page
159
through
161
of
the
record
when
he's
asked
to
point
one
out,
he
says,
“the
first
one
that
occurs
to
me”,
and
that
--
so
i
think
it's
obvious
when
we
take
this
language
plus
the
admission
in
the
brief
of
the
people
that
the
only
other
information
that
it
had
was
the
register
at
the
prison,
where
it
indicated
that
one
brother
had
visited
another
on
a
single
occasion,
indicates
that
in
fact,
and
i
challenge
the
people
here
today
to
indicate
any
other
source
that
act
--
obviously
there
was
actually
no
other
source
or
reason
for
this
inquiry
except
such
as
was
propelled
by
this
illegal
eavesdropping.
now,
going
from
that
to
the
question
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
i
--
i'd
like
to
hit
as
its
relation
to
the
states
through
its
integration
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
no
sir
except
indirectly
as
we
raised
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
protective
provisions
of
the
fifth
amendment
are
deemed
--
maybe
deemed
incorporated
in
the
due
process.
but
--
but
we
--
otherwise,
we
did
not
raise
that
specifically
sir.
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
yes
sir,
we
are.
well,
i
--
it
--
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
it
is
based
on
the
way
they
received
it
and
it
is
based
specifically
on
their
attempt
to
use
the
product
of
this
invasion
of
this
man's
privacy,
this
unconstitutional
invasion
of
his
privacy
as
a
means
to
try
to
coerce
through
the
use
of
another
arm
of
the
state
further
information
from
him.
and
therefore
to
compel
him
to
give
further
testimony
and
disclose
further
private
communications
which
would
not
have
been
inquired
about
but
for
the
illegal
act
and
unconstitutional
invasion
of
his
privacy
in
the
first
place.
now
--
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
no
sir
--
we
--
we
--
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
no,
but
we
--
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
no.
what
we
say
sir
is
that
no
individual
should
--
where
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
invaded,
that
the
product
of
that
invasion
cannot
be
used
for
any
purpose
and
certainly
not
to
coerce
from
him
because
this
is
what
it
amounts
to
further
information
which
would
never
ordinarily
have
been
inquired
about
but
for
the
illegality
in
the
first
place.
if
there
has
been
for
instance,
if
we
were
just
to
talk
about
the
fourth
amendment,
if
there
was
an
invasion
of
his
rights
by
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
we
cannot
thereby
we
say,
use
that
as
a
means
of
getting
further
information
from
him.
the
sole
purpose
or
the
sole
thing
that's
protected
by
the
constitution
is
merely
to
bar
the
intro
--
introduction
of
it
into
evidence
in
a
criminal
prosecution
against
the
individual,
the
protection
of
his
right
to
have
his
(inaudible)
and
violate
unless
there
was
a
--
a
legitimate
method
of
a
--
and
motivation
for
inquiring
into
him
is
equally
protected
by
the
constitution.
i
think
the
silverthorne
case
uses
that
specific
language.
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
yes,
well
i
--
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
no
sir.
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
black
that
we
object
both
of
the
method
in
which
this
was
obtained
and
to
the
additional
use
for
which
it
was
intended
to
be
put.
and
we
rest
both
on
the
fourth
amendment
because
we
regard
the
search
and
seizure
provision
as
having
been
violated
here
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
the
cases
and
we
also
claimed
that
irrespective
of
the
fourth
amendment,
as
mr.
pfeffer
argued,
there
was
an
invasion
of
a
general
rights
of
due
process
without
my
attempting
to
--
my
own
definition
here
in
this
court,
with
respect
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
you
see
with
the
respect
to
the
search
and
seizure
provision,
i
particularly
wanted
to
say
something
about
it
in
the
light
of
the
mapp
case
where
this
court
in
--
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
well
that
--
that's
one
--
that's
the
reason
why
we
--
we
did
--
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
we
didn't
offer
that
specific.
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
right,
right
sir.
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
right
sir.
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
and
that's
why
i
--
i
specifically
said
we're
--
we're
not
concerned
with
the
use
of
this
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
attaining
a
conviction
of
him
and
its
use
in
a
criminal
prosecution
against
him.
what
we're
concerned
with
is
the
use
of
the
fruits
of
such
an
illegal
investigation
or
inquiry
or
interception
of
this
conversation
for
purposes
other
than
a
criminal
prosecution
against
him.
and
we
believe
that
that's
equally
protected
by
his
constitutional
rights
--
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
that's
right
sir.
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
exactly
sir
because
it
compounds
the
wrong
that's
already
been
committed
and
it
permits
them
to
carry
that
on
a
further
step.
when
--
mr.
jacob
d.
fuchsberg
oh
--
that
--
that
is
right
sir.
with
respect
--
i
merely
--
in
connection
with
significance
of
the
mapp
case,
particularly
relating
to
this
case
and
i
want
to
make
a
few
comments
on
--
on
the
application
specifically
of
the
protective
guard
of
--
of
the
fourth
amendment
here
is
that
this
court
in
--
in
that
recent
case
pointed
out
that
you
didn't
need
a
technical
trespass
by
way
of
a
--
i
think
that's
the
language
of
the
court.
in
order
to
constitute
an
invasion
of
--
of
the
privacy
of
the
man's
domain
or
here
i
--
i
would
say,
it's
--
it's
more
than
his
castle
because
here
he
--
he's
a
guest
and
--
and
perhaps
even
a
higher
moral
code
of
obligation
attaches
to
a
temporary
abode
which
is
provided
for
him
specifically
by
someone
else
with
all
the
protective
moral
safeguards
that
--
that's
suppose
to
entail.
but
even
if
we
require
some
kind
of
a
thought,
even
it
be
not
a
technical
trespass,
in
order
to
--
by
--
in
order
to
give
rise
to
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment,
i
want
to
point
out
that
there
is
inherent
in
the
--
admitted
facts
in
this
case,
the
commission
of
at
least
one
of
several
thoughts.
for
instance,
there
is
--
in
this
particular
case,
the
element
of
fraud,
there
is
certainly
at
least
an
implied
representation
that
this
man
could
engage
in
this
conference
safely
and
with
privately
in
the
precinct
of
this
particular
conference
room
and
a
--
a
violation
of
that
promise
is
certainly
tortuous.
at
least,
it
certainly
would
come
under
the
general
character
of
an
action
on
the
case
on
--
on
the
common
law
--
in
our
common
law.
in
addition,
i
would
say
that
--
since
the
people
here
have
argued
that
mr.
lanza
was
there
in
effect
by
sufferance,
that's
what
they
say.
there
are
all
kinds
of
regulations
in
the
prison.
there's
no
indication
that
he
knew
about
them
and
that
therefore
his
right
to
privacy
in
this
conversation
was
not
inviolable
and
it
almost
shocks
me
to
have
read
that
argument.
nevertheless,
i
think
even
in
common
law
where
a
person
is
a
bare
licensee,
even
there,
there
is
a
safeguard
against
entrapment.
in
other
words,
you
cannot
set
a
trap
for
a
person
even
if
he
is
not
a
business
visitor
or
partakes
of
some
of
the
highest
standards
of
care
that
are
old
--
in
the
law
of
tort.
and
in
this
particular
case
by
--
ever
since
we
have
the
setting
of
a
snare
and
a
trap
specifically,
obviously,
no
matter
what
his
relationship
was
in
this
particular
room,
there
was
to
him
a
standard
of
care
that
was
obviously
violated.
so
that
if
we
need
in
our
case,
in
order
to
give
rise
very
forcefully
to
their
protective
guard
of
the
fourth
amendment,
we
have
here
plenty
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
fact
with
regard
to
the
--
to
the
performance
of
a
tortuous
act
and
the
use
of
that
in
order
to
extort
from
him
through
the
use
of
perhaps
an
invisible
but
not
imaginary
means
of
invading
or
seizing
from
him
the
private
contents
of
his
conversations
with
his
brother
in
this
particular
prison.
now,
the
people
have
argued
in
their
brief
that
the
universal
condemnation
and
they're
willing
to
rest
with
that
kind
of
slap
on
the
wrist
which
would
be
of
a
little
help
to
mr.
lanza
that
the
universal
condemnation
of
the
conduct
of
that
branch
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
engaged
in
this
eavesdropping,
they
say
that
that
condemnation
really
attached
only
to
the
invasion
of
the
attorney-client
privilege,
to
the
extent
that
one
of
the
conversations
tapped
was
one
not
only
with
mr.
harry
lanza
who
is
the
brother
of
the
--
of
the
prisoner
but
also
with
his
attorney
as
well.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
in
this
very
case
involving
the
brother
and
not
the
attorney,
the
appellate
division
of
the
state
of
new
york
specifically
referred
to
the
conduct
here
and
i
quote
this
from
their
opinion,
“that
the
conduct
here
was
reprehensible
and
defensive.”
the
court
at
that
time
though
when
it
handed
down
its
opinion
in
the
appellate
division,
felt
that
it
was
restrained
by
the
law
as
if
then
conceived
it
to
be
prior
to
the
decision
in
the
mapp
case
to
permit
the
evidence
which
was
the
fruit
of
this
illegal
inquiry
into
evidence
no
matter
how
rep
--
reprehensive
and
offensive
they
considered
it.
now,
we
have
pointed
out
to
this
court
that
in
a
series
of
decisions
which
we
believe
are
very
analogous
in
principle
to
this
one,
in
the
leyra
case,
and
in
the
rochin
case
and
in
the
silverthorne
case.
this
court
has
clearly
indicated
that
in
a
variety
of
circumstances
and
in
a
variety
of
manners,
the
fruits
of
the
wrongdoing
cannot
be
used
and
cannot
be
used
at
all
and
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
case
where
what
--
i
don't
think
we
can
divide
the
parole
commission
on
the
one
hand
and
the
legislative
committee
on
the
other.
it
is
all
one
political
and
sovereign
entity.
they
were
mere
--
they
are
merely
two
arms
of
the
same
state
and
that
the
act
of
one
cannot
be
used
to
--
as
a
--
in
order
to
press
further
in
the
direction
of
the
violation
of
the
rights
of
the
defendant
in
this
case
and
to
this
reason
which
we
respectfully
ask
that
this
conviction
be
set
aside
and
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
be
granted
his
freedom.
