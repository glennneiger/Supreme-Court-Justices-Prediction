(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
it
come
down
to
this
mr.
fuchsberg,
what
you're
saying
is
that
because
of
the
way
they
did
this,
they
couldn't
even
ask
him
the
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore
they
can't
predicate
any
conviction
for
refusal
to
answer
them
upon
questions
that
they
should
never
asked
him
in
the
first
place
because
merely
to
ask
him
was
to
allow
them
the
fruits
of
an
illegal
act
that
you
say
violates
both
the
fourth
amendment
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
and
the
due
process
provision
of
the
fourteenth
independently
heretofore?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
your
statute
inquire
that
the
committee
affirmatively
extend
immunity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then,
did
they
call
him
back,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
put
the
same
questions
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
he
refuses
to
answer
as
he
did
here,
the
committee
when
the
questions
are
put,
does
the
committee
have
to
go
back
to
the
legislature
for
--
as
it's
done
in
the
case
of
a
congressional
committee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
should
you
even
be
making
the
same
argument
of
the
committee
itself
that
bugged
that
room?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
be
arguing.
in
other
words,
that
the
committee
has
the
power
to
question
and
all
that
was
asserted
here
was
the
power
to
question.
his
refusal
to
answer
was
based
on
the
fact
that
had
no
powers
i
understand
the
argument
of
the
other
side,
the
question
at
all
because
of
the
bugging
of
the
room.
but
your
position
would
be
the
committee
would
still
have
the
power
to
question
at
least,
even
though
it
itself
had
bugged
you,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
--
even
assuming
that
--
in
other
respects,
it
might
be
a
violation
of
the
forth
amendment,
who
had
bugged
the
room.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
pertinency
in
that
sense
is
not
challenged.
that
is
of
the
questioning
this
witness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
may
not
be
but
--
it
may
not
be
of
his
own
choosing
i
expect
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
his
place
of
abode,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
on
the
case
cited
in
the
brief
here,
the
one
involved
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
apparent
--
if
that's
so
at
least
to
that
extent,
your
state
courts
have
put
a
limitation
upon
even
asking
questions
of
someone
whose
conversation
of
this
kind
was
overheard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
as
--
what
i'm
--
i
thought
you
had
answered
me
earlier
that
because
this
was
a
legislative
inquiry,
the
fact
that
they
may
have
been
prompted
to
subpoena
to
this
petitioner
as
a
witness
by
reason
of
anything
they
may
have
overheard
in
that
bugged
conversation
and
the
fact
that
doing
so
may
have
been
a
violation
either
of
the
fourth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
nevertheless
because
it
was
a
legislative
inquiry,
as
long
as
the
questions
were
pertinent
to
the
subject
matter
of
that
inquiry,
they
were
entitled
to
call
him
as
a
witness
and
ask
him
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
apparently
is
not
so
in
this
other
case
involving
a
lawyer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
did
say
earlier
too
that
i
understood
in
your
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
black
that
even
in
the
situation
such
as
we
have
here,
had
there
been
brutality
used
rather
than
a
bugging
that
this
would
have
disabled
constitutionally.
the
committee
even
from
subpoenaing
the
petitioner
and
after
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
suppose
this
--
suppose
this
has
been
of
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
that
it
was
a
breaking
into
landless
home
and
then
overhearing
a
conversation
and
then
the
same
thing
had
followed,
did
the
committee
then
have
been
able
to
interrogate
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
those
of
course
--
that
--
that
is
a
little
different
for
--
those
of
the
records
but
whether
--
if
the
question
i've
put
you
was,
if
we
had
everything
here
except
that
it
was
a
breaking
flagrant
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
into
his
home
an
overheard
conversation
and
then
they
had
subpoenaed
him
to
--
before
the
--
and
put
the
same
question
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
--
isn't
this
true
though
mr.
uviller
in
costello
if
my
--
my
memory
serves
me
that
it
was
affirmative
testimony
by
mr.
hogan
had
that
information
from
other
sources.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
taps
went
back
as
i
remember
it
many
years
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
addition
--
in
addition,
mr.
hogan
testified
i
think
make
to
other
sources
which
in
fact
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
have
anything
like
--
we
don't
have
like
anything
like
that
here,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
and
then
he
identify
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
identify
the
other
sources?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
costello?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
maybe
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
may
have
been
a
little
obscure
in
writing
the
opinion.i
had
some
recollection
with
--
with
some
other.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
in
that
connection,
i
want
to
be
clear
mr.
pfeffer,
i
think
fuchsberg
answered
the
question
of
mine
that,
yes,
your
position
is
that
by
reason
of
this
bugging,
this
committee
could
not
even
have
summoned
this
witness
and
put
questions
to
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
the
chief
justice
asked
mr.
uviller
whether
he'd
make
--
whether
there
was
--
a
distinction
could
be
drawn
if
this
had
been
a
grand
jury
inquiry,
would
you
draw
that
distinction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
when
you
say
unusable,
because
i
get
it,
unusable
in
this
context
is
it
couldn't
--
the
committee
couldn't
even
ask
him
a
question.
