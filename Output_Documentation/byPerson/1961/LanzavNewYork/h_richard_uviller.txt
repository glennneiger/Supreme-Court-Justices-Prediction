mr.
h.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
comes
before
this
high
court
on
a
contention
that
the
state
of
new
york
has
violated
certain
of
his
constitutionally
cognizable
rights.
i
think
in
order
to
evaluate
that
claim,
it's
necessary
first
to
put
the
contention
into
its
factual
context
for
it
is
only
by
that
means
that
the
constitution
in
this
area
can
be
given
meaning.
it
goes
without
doubt
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
appeared
only
as
a
witness
before
a
commission.
there
is
not
here
involved
a
criminal
charge.
there
is
not
here
involved
the
use
of
evidence
against
him
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
enjoyed
the
complete
immunity
from
prosecution
which
was
accorded
him
by
the
committee.
there
was
in
fact
no
right
which
was
in
any
jeopardy
or
which
was
harmed
in
any
way
by
the
proceedings
which
he
faced
before
this
joint
committee.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
what
happened
in
this
case
was
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
he
was
asked
a
number
of
questions
on
all
of
which
he
asserted
his
right
to
decline
to
answer
on
grounds
of
self-incrimination
again
under
the
pertinent
provisions
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
and
thereafter
was
granted
by
vote
of
the
committee,
immunity
from
prosecution
from
or
because
of
and
future
use
against
him
of
any
and
all
answers
he
might
make
in
this
regard.
thereafter,
the
questions
were
posed
to
him
again.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
apparently
so
your
honor.
there
was
at
the
time
some
debate
among
the
members
of
the
committee
as
to
the
precise
mechanism
that
they
should
use.
and
eventually,
a
vote
was
taken
and
he
was
informed
that
he
had
the
immunity.
apparently
the
committee
made
some
inquiry
into
whether
or
not
they
had
the
authority
to
grant
the
immunity
and
found
that
they
did
as
in
fact
they
do.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
believe
so,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir.
the
questions
in
all
were
of
course
as
we've
said
19.
of
those
19,
the
committee
counsel
unequivocally
testified
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
but
that
is
apparently
so
your
honor,
yes.
unless
he
--
the
immunity
consists
in
the
future
use
against
most
statements
which
he
may
make
in
response.
consequently,
if
he
makes
no
response
at
all,
apparently,
he
has
no
immunity
and
he
maybe
prosecuted.
certainly,
the
immunity
does
not
extend
to
possible
contempt.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it's
my
understanding
that
that
is
a
fact,
however
i
cannot
state
any
authority
on
the
question
because
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
in
which
it
was
done.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
apparently,
not
to
the
legislature.
what
was
done
in
this
case
was
that
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings
returned
over
to
a
grand
jury
in
the
county
of
new
york
and
predicated
upon
that
transcript,
the
grand
jury
returned
the
information
containing
the
counts
which
reflected
the
questions
that
were
refused
to
answer
before
the
committee.
it
is
made
a
misdemeanor
under
the
penal
law
and
in
this
case,
the
misdemeanor
was
charged
by
grand
jury
proceeding.
now
the
--
i
don't
want
to
go
first
to
the
question
which
has
concerned
my
adversary
for
some
time
on
the
severability
of
the
questions.
but
i
should
like
to
concentrate
first
on
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
which
this
petitioner
faced
before
the
joint
legislative
committee.
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
the
panoply
of
constitutional
rights
enjoined
by
man
accused
of
a
crime.
and
those
enjoined
by
a
witness
who
appears
before
a
duly
constituted
and
authorized
committee
of
a
legislative
body
which
is
seeking
to
find
facts
and
exercising
that
vital
and
inherent
function
of
investigation
which
this
court
has
recognized
to
be
an
important
adjunct
to
the
legislative
power.
under
those
circumstances,
and
i
submit
that
it
is
because
of
the
fact
that
no
personal
or
property
rights
are
involved.
the
witness
before
the
committee
has
very
limited
rights.
now,
in
--
the
recent
case
of
hannah
against
larche
handed
down
by
this
court,
i
believe
that
the
principal
was
--
was
well
stated
and
exactly
stated.
furthermore,
the
court
has
expressed
considerable
reluctance
to
interfere
with
the
legislative
process
in
this
regard.
the
only
cases
which
i've
been
able
to
discover,
have
been
cases
from
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
in
which
it
is
clearly
stated
that
if
there
be
an
abuse
by
a
legislative
investigation
and
if
there
be
a
threatened
denial
of
a
constitutional
right
by
this
investigated
methods,
the
remedy
is
with
the
people
and
with
the
legislature
itself.
i
submit
that
this
is
wise
so
there's
no
reason
to
assume
that
a
legislature
is
any
less
concerned
with
the
rights
of
--
of
its
individual
citizens,
then
as
a
court.
and
in
this
very
instance
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
my
adversary,
the
legislature
of
new
york
has
acted
and
has
passed
an
eavesdropping
statute
which
clearly
covers
any
--
any
constitutional
denial
by
any
person
in
the
course
of
the
conducting
of
an
investigation.
now,
it
has
been
argued
here
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
would
mr
justice
brennan.
i
--
i
--
i'm
coming
in
a
moment
i
hope
to
the
point
that
the
bugging
of
that
room
did
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
itself.
now
at
the
present
time,
i'm
trying
to
advance
the
idea
that
even
if
it
did,
there
was
no
right
at
--
pertaining
to
the
witness
for
the
committee.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that
would
be
precisely
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
i
think
that
the
--
the
--
the
purpose
and
eventual
use
of
the
information
obtained
by
this
method
is
--
is
crucial.
in
the
instant
case,
i
stressed
very
strongly
that
the
use
was
a
proper
legislative
one.
there's
been
no
contention
advanced
throughout
these
proceedings
that
the
legislature
was
in
fact
duly
authorized
to
conduct
such
an
investigation.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
both
pertinency
and
purpose
your
honor.
the
--
the
questions
asked
the
witness
certainly
were
pertinent
to
the
general
subject
of
possible
corruption
in
the
parole
commission
and
there's
certainly
no
question
that
the
legislature
through
its
committee
had
a
right
to
investigate
such
a
--
such
a
possibility
as
corruption
in
one
of
the
executive
branches,
so
that
there
was
a
legislative
purpose.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
believe
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself,
mr.
justice
black,
there
are
limits
--
well,
on
what
the
state
can
do
in
any
circumstances.
and
i
think
those
limits
have
been
expressed
clearly
in
the
rochin
and
the
leyra
case.
there
are
circumstances
where
a
state
will
go
so
far
for
the
accumulation
of
evidence
for
one
proceeding
or
another
where
the
conscience
of
civilized
men
will
be
shocked,
and
i
think
that
the
use
of
torture
is
one
such
example.
certainly,
the
physical
violence
that
was
used
in
rochin
was
thought
to
be
such
that
--
that
a
violation
of
due
process
in
itself
was
occasioned.
and
i
would
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
would
--
i
would
--
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say,
yes.
i
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
--
i
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
considerable
more
limited
than
the
fourteenth.
i'm
aware
of
fact
--
perhaps
this
is
a
good
point
to
make
a
transition.
i'm
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
--
this
court
has
held
that
eavesdropping
does
constitute
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
but
only
where
it
is
conducted.
in
such
circumstances
as
to
indicate
that
there
has
been
a
physical
intrusion
into
a
protected
area.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
in
this
instance,
the
facts
of
the
case
will
show
that
there
was
no
physical
intrusion
into
a
protected
area
and
perhaps
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
(inaudible)
there
was
indeed
no
physical
intrusion
into
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
it's
my
understanding
that
irvine
against
california,
your
honor,
has
held
that
it
was
in
fact
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
of
course
in
that
case,
on
the
prevailing
doctrine
of
wolf
against
colorado,
the
conviction
was
not
disturbed
on
those
grounds.
similar
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that
was
indeed
a
man's
home
and
in
--
and
so
was
the
silverman
case
recently
from
this
jurisdiction
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
irvine?
my
understanding
of
the
irvine
case
was
that
there
was
a
statement
in
that
case
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
however,
there
had
been
no
violation
of
the
fourteenth
under
the
then
prevailing
doctrine
of
the
fourth
amendment
did
not
compel
the
--
the
state
of
california
to
adhere
to
the
exclusionary
rule
which
is
currently
the
law.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
exactly,
i
believe
that
the
wolf
against
colorado
was
the
controlling
case
in
the
decision.
but
i
think
that
there
was
at
least
an
--
a
dictum
in
the
case
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
violated
and
in
fact,
the
goldman
case
followed
the
same
test
and
there
where
there
was
no
physical
intrusion
but
a
detectaphone
placed
upon
the
outside
wall
of
a
room
without
any
physical
intrusion
into
the
room,
it
was
held
that
there
was
no
illegal
search
and
seizure.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
because
there
was
no
physical
intrusion
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
that
is
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
--
to
make.
that
the
silverman
case
itself
has
restated
only
very
recently
the
physical
intrusion
into
a
protective
area
of
test.
well,
now
i
submit
that
under
the
facts
in
the
instant
case,
there
was
in
the
first
instance,
no
physical
intrusion.
now,
i
say
that
fully
mindful
of
the
fact,
that
the
record
is
bare
in
the
question
of
where
this
particular
microphone
was
placed.
but
certainly,
there
was
no
evidence
below
that
the
--
that
the
microphone
had
been
placed
in
the
business
room
by
means
of
a
physical
intrusion
into
the
room.
on
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
is
--
it
--
it
is
--
it
is
let
us
say,
a
temporary
resting
place.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
in
--
in
any
event.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
is
indeed
but
it
is
an
abode
of
such
a
nature
that
rights
are
necessarily
lost
upon
incarceration.
now,
one
loses
many
rights
in
prison,
one
loses
the
rights
to
possessions,
the
right
to
free
commerce
with
others
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
or
move
about,
no
question.
and
i
think
that
perhaps
primary
among
these
rights
is
the
right
to
privacy.
a
prisoner
is
subject
to
search
at
all
times
by
his
guards
arbitrarily
and
without
cause
that
can
be
no
question
of
it,
the
rules
of
the
correction
department
of
new
york
explicitly
so
provide.
he
is
subject
to
physical
observation.
his
cells
are
open.
his
movements
are
watched.
and
i
would
submit
that
he
certainly
is
subject
to
the
surveillance
of
a
guard
in
any
and
all
parts
of
that
prison
so
long
as
he
is
a
guest
of
the
state
there.
and
--
and
in
this
instance,
we
do
not
have
in
the
record
any
description
of
the
physical
confines
of
the
so-called
visitor's
room.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
quite
so
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
he
was
a
--
if
--
well,
mr.
fuchsberg
has
--
has
introduced
tort
law
into
this
case
and
i
--
i
see
we
now
come
into
--
to
real
property.
i
--
i
--
i
would
say
that
he
was
in
the
room
with
the
prisoner
joseph
lanza.
certainly,
joseph
lanza
is
the
person
who
is
confined
in
the
prison
and
if
there
is
the
offer
of
an
aura
of
privacy
which
he
contends
there
was,
it
was
an
offer
to
him,
not
to
the
petitioner
in
the
instant
case
who
was
his
brother.
but
i
would
submit
that
such
an
offer
of
an
aura
of
privacy
as
is
contended
was
made
in
this
case
is
absolutely
bound
of
support
in
the
record.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
from
the
record
itself,
if
there
was
any
search
offer,
it
was
not
accepted
as
such
by
either
the
prisoner
or
the
petitioner.
for
the
transcript
itself
reveals
that
their
conversations
had
in
this
prison
visitor's
room,
was
certainly
not
the
type
of
free
and
open
conversation
which
one
would
expect
to
find
in
a
secure,
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
most
certainly
--
i
--
i
think
the
result
would
be
the
same
too
and
i
think
the
petitioner
has
so
conceded.
i
think
that
he
has
conceded
that
the
warden
had
the
right
to
be
there
and
overhear
the
conversation
provided
he
did
so
openly.
i
think
that
he
predicates
his
argument
solely
on
the
--
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
concealed
or
an
electronic
device
and
that
--
that
there
was
somehow
an
intrinsic
immorality
attaching
to
the
use
of
such
a
device
whereas
if
a
man's
ear.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
know
of
no
such
provision.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
the
law
is
to
the
contrary.
i
think
the
law
is
to
the
contrary
in
new
york
state
mr.
justice
black.
our
regulations
provide
that
prisoner
and
his
belongings
are
subject
to
search
by
the
keeper
for
contraband
weapons
and
so
forth.
while
a
man
is
in
prison
of
course
his
belongings
himself
are
severely
limited.
many
prisons,
maximum
security
prison
such
as
this
one
do
not
even
permit
him
to
keep
his
own
clothes.
certainly,
the
--
the
writing
implements,
the
shaving
implements
and
all
of
the
usual
tools
of
living
are
sharply
limited
and
supervised
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
that
all
visitors
also
are
searched
upon
coming
in
or
certainly
packages
are
removed
from
them
and
the
regulations
provide
for
that
as
well.
in
other
words,
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
area
where
the
constitutional
protections
as
such
are
of
necessity
if
not
by
design
greatly
limited.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
a
prisoner
has
no
rights
in
jail.
obviously,
a
prisoner
has
many
rights
in
jail.
he
always
has
the
right
to
petition
to
a
court.
he
has
the
right
to
confer
to
with
counsel
and
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say,
confer
with
counsel
in
private
and
the
--
and
he
has
the
right
to
be
free
of
brutality
or
--
or
physical
torture.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
i
do
not
think
it
was
mr.
chief
justice,
for
this
reason.
there
were
two
conversations
in
essence
that
were
overheard
by
means
of
these
devices.
one
was
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
it
came
about
in
this
way
sir.
the
first
was
a
conversation
between
the
prisoner
and
his
wife
ellen.
during
the
course
of
that
conversation
which
was
very
general
in
nature,
he
--
she
indicated
to
him
that
his
attorney,
sylvester
cosentino
was
there
and
they
had
driven
up
together.
during
the
course
of
the
conversation
toward
the
end
of
it,
the
attorney,
mr.
cosentino
apparently
walked
into
the
visitor's
room
because
there
is
a
hello,
by
joseph
lanza
and
then
from
thereon,
his
voice
participating.
however,
there
is
indication
in
the
conversation
of
all
that
he
expected
to
converse
in
private
with
the
prisoner
shortly
in
another
place.
this
is
the
only
indication
we
have
had
in
the
records
so
far
the
existence
of
this
lawyer's
room
but
apparently
not
contested
that
there
was
such.
so
that
there
was
for
a
while
a
three-way
conversation
on
the
tape
between
the
prisoner,
joseph
lanza,
not
the
petitioner,
his
wife,
ellen
and
cosentino.
at
the
end
of
that
conversation,
the
wife
walks
out
and
the
attorney
is
in
the
business
room
with
the
prisoner
for
approximately
six
exchanges
that
take
place
between
them.
let's
say
about
six
things
when
suddenly
interrupted
the
door
is
open,
there's
another
voice
and
they
both
leave
apparently
to
continue
their
conference
in
the
lawyer's
room.
now,
that
conversation,
that
entire
conversation
is
in
no
way
involved
in
the
present
case.
now,
i
wish
to
emphasize
that,
if
there
was
in
that
brief
exchange
and
interference
with
an
attorney's
privilege,
it
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
but
it
is
perfectly
clear,
from
the
testimony
of
the
committee
counsel
below,
that
insofar
as
any
of
the
questions
put
to
harry
lanza
were
based
upon
the
intercepted
conversations,
they
were
only
based
upon
interceptive
conversations
between
harry
and
joseph,
and
they
were
not
based
upon
intercepted
conversations
between
the
prisoner
and
his
wife,
which
perhaps
enjoys
greater
legal
protection
than
the
relationship
between
brothers
and
certainly
not
between
the
attorney
and
the
prisoner.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
an
independent
case
in
new
york
that
arose
out
of
attempt
to
hold
the
attorney
in
contempt
for
refusing
to
answer
questions
before
another
state
investigative
body
predicated
upon
that
brief
exchange
that
he
had
with
his
client.
and
the
courts
of
new
york
declined
to
do
so
primarily
on
the
ground
that
even
though
the
questions
did
not
themselves
constitute
a
breach
of
the
attorney-client
relationship
nor
would
the
answers
have
constituted
such.
they
did
flow
from
this
interception
and
the
--
and
therefore,
the
attorney
could
not
be
compelled
to
answer
them.
but
in
any
event,
that
was
a
completely
independent
matter
as
far
as
the
present
case
is
concerned
but
as
the
tapes
here
involved
and
the
only
tape
involved
here
was
the
conversation
between
the
brothers,
harry
and
joseph.
and
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
questions
themselves
which
paraphrase
matters
which
appeared
upon
the
tapes
that
they
were
referring
only
to
that
portion
of
the
interception
which
were
occurred
between
the
two
brothers
and
that
the
interference
if
any,
with
the
attorney-client
relationship
was
in
no
way
involved.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
a
matter
of
(inaudible)
i
believe
it
is
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
that
in
this
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
exactly
so,
just
as
--
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
that
is
what
i
attempted
to
imply
when
i
said
that
we
concede
and
fully
concede
that
even
a
prisoner
has
a
number
of
constitutionally
protected
right.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
i
--
i
have
--
i
have
emphasized
or
attempted
to
emphasize
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
which
is
predicated
upon
the
status
of
this
particular
witness
and
the
questions
that
were
involved
asked
of
him.
now,
as
to
the
case
of
reuter
against
cosentino,
i
--
i
would
not
support
it
or
oppose
it.
it
is
the
law
in
new
york.
i
think
that
it
went
quite
far
and
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
it
went
further
that
it
needed
to
because
there
was
a
--
a
statement
there
that
there
was
in
fact
no
actual
interference.
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
him
were
questions
such
as
did
you
go
to
see
someone
as
a
result
of
your
conversation
with
him
and
so
on,
matters
which
would
be
outside
of
the
privilege
themselves.
however,
the
--
the
courts
i
think
bent
over
backwards
in
that
instance
in
order
to
express
their
feeling
about
their
relationship
involved.
the
relationship
between
a
prisoner
and
his
attorney
and
perhaps
the
legislative
committee
in
that
--
in
that
regard
of
--
should
feel
itself
constrained
to
follow
at
least
the
thinking
of
the
court.
however,
i
would
emphasize
that
in
doing
so,
the
court
went
further
than
--
than
i
think
is
proper
in
curtailing
a
coequal
branch
of
government.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
i
would
go
so
far
and
i
--
and
i
--
and
i
would
moreover
say
that
if
there
had
been
any
jeopardy
to
his
--
to
his
rights
as
a
result
of
the
committee
action,
that
is
to
say
if
he
in
anyway
could
suffer
personally
in
his
personal
private
--
or
property
as
a
result
that
that
also
might
serve
as
some
limitation
on
the
--
on
how
far
they
could
go.
even
though
--
i
say
this,
even
though
there
are
a
number
of
cases
which
we
rely
on
in
our
brief
in
which
there
were
in
fact
possible
criminal
penalties
involved
as
a
result
or
outcome
of
the
investigation
and
nonetheless,
this
court
declined
to
interfere
with
respect
to
the
powers
of
investigation,
the
powers
of
congress
to
inform
itself.
in
hannah
against
larche
itself
as
the
court
will
remember
there
was
a
--
an
investigation
there
into
a
possible
denial
of
suffrage
and
--
and
possible
criminal
violations
attended
thereto.
nonetheless,
the
right
of
a
witness
to
know
the
man
accusing
him,
the
right
to
see
the
records
of
the
--
of
the
complaints
and
the
right
to
cross-examine
its
accusers
was
suspended.
and
certainly,
these
are
fundamental
--
fundamental
rights
attended
upon
an
adjudicative
type
of
proceeding
but
even
there
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
--
i
know
of
--
of
no
decision
in
this
court
on
the
point
precisely.
from
my
understanding
is
that
that
is
the
close
to
that
fact
in
hearst
against
black
in
the
--
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
even
though
there
had
been
a
--
a
--
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure
and
records
have
been
obtained,
the
courts
refused
to
enjoin
nor
use
at
a
commission
hearing
thereafter.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
consequently
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
in
the
event
that
there
had
been
a
clear
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
obtaining
of
the
information,
i
would
say
that
in
a
legislative
proceeding
where
the
witness
was
given
full
immunity
from
any
possible
incrimination
or
any
possible
harm
to
him
from
disclosure,
that
fact
alone
should
not
prevent
the
legislature
from
informing
itself
further
on
the
information
which
he
has
obtained
in
that
manner.
i
can
see
clearly
that
there
might
be
situations
in
which
a
very
important
community
need
a
great
problem
and
is
raised
and
the
only
information
the
legislature
has,
has
come
to
it
through
the
legal
means.
now,
they're
not
interested
in
punishing
anybody.
they're
not
interested
in
bringing
any
indictments
against
anybody.
what
they're
interested
in
is
a
valid
legislative
purpose
to
a
man
to
change
the
law
in
such
a
way
to
prevent
this
situation
from
being
aggravated.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
is
the
legislature
to
be
foreclosed
and
precluded
from
informing
itself
further
solely
because
the
fact
that
the
initial
information
was
obtained
illegally.
i
would
say,
no.
insofar
as
no
rights
to
the
witness
are
involved
then
the
legislative
right
to
inform
itself
should
be
supreme.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i
think
certainly
that
that
is
a
factor.
the
fact
that
there
wasn't
--
that
there
--
that
there
was
no
connection
between
the
body
which
eventually
used
the
information
and
the
body
which
obtained
it
is
a
significant
factor
in
the
case.
however,
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
were
it
the
same
body
that
the
same
result
would
not
pertain
because
essentially
what
we're
dealing
here
was
the
legislative
function.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
we
certainly
do
not.
the
facts
in
this
case
indicate
that
there
was
--
the
committee
itself,
the
joint
legislative
committee
itself
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
ordering
of
the
use
of
this
electronic
device.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
grand
jury
had
--
had
offered
immunity
to
the
witness.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
the
grand
jury
had
offered
immunity
to
this
witness,
i
think
it
would
be
exactly
the
same.
yes
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i
did
and
for
two
reasons,
one,
because
a
le
--
the
legislature
enjoys
a
certain
independence
as
a
coequal
branch
of
government
and
second
because
as
a
legislative
inquiry,
it
was
fact
finding
purely.
it
was
not
adjudicative
and
no
one's
rights
could've
been
affected
by
the
outcome.
and
in
that
respect,
it
resembles
the
grand
jury
proceeding
in
which
the
witness
was
given
immunity.
now,
i
would
like
to
come
now
to
the
question
of
the
severability
of
the
questions.
and
in
this
respect,
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize.
i
was
challenged
by
my
adversary
to
do
so,
that
the
testimony
that
we
have
in
the
case
comes
solely
from
the
committee
counsel
himself.
his
testimony
is
that
there
were
a
number
of
other
sources
which
were
not
developed
by
cross-examination
as
to
what
they
were
which
lead
them
to
this
particular
investigation
and
to
this
particular
witness.
indeed,
it's
quite
reasonable
that
there
should
be.
at
the
time,
there
was
not
only
the
record
book
of
the
prison
which
showed
that
he
was
a
visitor
and
indeed
had
to
show
that
harry
lanza
visited
his
brother
joseph
lanza,
but
there
was
also
considerable
amount
of
newspaper
publicity.
and
certainly,
the
if
--
their
investigation
were
undertaken
into
the
manner
in
which
joseph
lanza
had
obtained
his
release
on
parole
is
quite
normal
that
those
in
his
family
and
those
who
visited
him
and
those
who
were
connected
with
his
interest
should
be
called
in
as
witnesses
to
supply
what
information
they
may
have
to
the
investigating
body.
this
apparently
is
what
was
done
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that
it's
quite
clear
from
the
testimony
of
the
trial
from
mr.
bauman,
brief
as
it
is
that
he
was
making
every
effort,
every
possible
conscientious
effort
at
that
time
to
be
perfectly
fair
in
his
responses
as
to
the
derivation
of
the
matters
which
went
to
the
formula
--
into
the
questions
he
formulated
as
committee
counsel.
now,
i
think
that
it
would
be
seen
for
example
from
his
request
--
the
question
as
to
the
third
account
in
the
indictment
that
he
said,
“well,
i
want
to
be
perfectly
fair
with
you.
i
think
that
it
might
have
been
based
in
part
upon
the
transcript
as
well
as
upon
other
information
which
we
had.”
now,
there
was
no
such
equivocal
answer
with
respect
to
either
the
first
or
last
count
of
this
information.
it
was
absolutely
exquisite.
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
these
questions
were
not
predicated
in
anyway
upon
the
information.
now,
counsel
has
advanced
thought
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i'm
not
asking
your
honor
to
assume
it.
i'm
--
the
testimony
at
the
trial
was
clear
and
explicit
on
that
point
but
it
was
not
derived
from
the
--
from
the
taps.
the
questions
themselves
reveal
that
it
was
not.
the
first
and
last
question
asked
him
simply,
“what
efforts
did
you
make
on
behalf
of
your
brother
to
obtain
his
restoration
to
parole?”
now
this
is
certainly
the
type
of
question
which
one
would
expect
completely
independent
of
any
transcripts.
there's
nothing
in
the
transcripts
themselves
that
--
that
was
utilized
in
the
formulation
of
the
question
as
there
was
in
the
other
17
questions.
the
same
is
true
with
the
last
question,
perfectly
general
question
about
efforts
that
he
made
in
behalf
of
his
brother.
top
--
the
two
questions
taken
on
their
face
in
addition
to
the
testimony
given
by
the
counsel
who
formulated
them
to
the
effect
that
certainly
they
were
not
based
in
any
measure
upon
the
transcripts,
i
submit
is
a
factual
determination
that
they
were
not.
in
response
to
this,
counsel
apparently
urges
that
they
were
so
intertwined
that
--
of
necessity
one
contributed
to
the
other
and
in
fact
he
would
have
never
been
called
as
a
witness
at
all
if
not
had
been
for
the
transcripts.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
--
the
entire
subject
of
the
source
of
the
question
was
developed
on
cross-examination.
and
he
was
asked
explicitly
about
each
of
the
questions
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
that
was
--
that
was
stated
during
the
course
of
cross-examination
when
he
was
asked
on
cross-examination
to
indicate
any
question
or
questions
in
the
series
which
were
not
based
upon
this
information
and
he
indicated
those
two.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
absolutely
no
equivocation
as
to
those
two
questions
mr.
justice.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
was.
that
was
before
the
trial
judge
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
as
--
that
is
certainly
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
did
either
one
of
them
mention
it?
no,
i
don't
believe
that
it
was
explicitly
contested.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
in
a
decision
--
well,
there
was
no
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
--
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
it
was
exquisitely
mentioned.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
beg
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
was
mentioned
as
part
of
the
general
factual
contentions,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
don't
believe
that
you
do
at
the
present
time.
i
could
certainly
supply
them
to
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
was
the
testimony
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
certainly
sir.
in
fact,
it's
our
contention
in
the
terms.
as
far
as
the
basic
concern
--
i
would
--
i
would
be
very
glad
to
furnish
the
court
with
copies
of
those
briefs
and
indicate
proportions.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
the
--
the
--
the
issue
before
the
court
it
seems
to
me
is
this,
did
the
committee
in
formulating
these
questions,
predicate
the
question
upon
contaminated
sources
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
source
was
contaminated.
now
in
making
that
determination,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
factual
testimony
of
the
committee
counsel
who
--
which
is
the
only
testimony
on
the
point
in
the
record,
must
be
taken
as
conclusive
as
to
the
fact
and
that
is
the
fact
that
they
were
not
predicated
upon
that
information.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
there
has
been
no
suggestion
of
that
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
they
certainly
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
so
it
would
seem
to
me
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
now
as
to
that,
i
would
say
that
there's
absolutely
nothing
upon
which
counsel
bases
his
contention
in
that
regard.
he
claims
that
--
that
of
necessity,
they
must
have
called
him
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
--
his
conversation
was
overheard.
i
say
that
whatever
testimony
there
was
below
about
the
calling
of
this
witness,
is
--
is
to
the
contract
and
that
is
that
there
were
a
number
of
sources
independent
of
the
transcript
which
--
which
led
them
to
call
this
witness
as
well
as
others.
and
among
those
were
not
merely
--
as
i've
mentioned
before,
not
merely
the
fact
that
he
was
a
visitor
of
his
brother's
in
prison
but
as
well
the
fact
that
his
name
was
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
entire
case
in
--
in
publicity
and
--
and
the
fact
that
he
was
in
fact
the
brother
of
--
of
the
prisoner
who
--
whose
parole
was
under
investigation.
clearly,
there
are
a
number
of
factors
independent
of
these
transcripts,
which
point
to
the
logical
action
of
the
committee
investigating
this
subject
to
call
those
intimately
concerned
with
the
welfare
of
the
--
of
the
man
whose
parole
is
under
investigation.
certainly,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
--
that
--
to
the
contract
that
the
transcripts
were
the
reason
that
he
was
called.
but
whether
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
was.
he
--
he
did
indicate
he
was
--
he
did
indicate
at
that
time,
it
wasn't
developed
extensively
but
there
was
testimony
at
the
hearing
also
with
respect
to
the
reasons
that
he'd
been
called
as
a
witness.
and
he
indicated
that
there
were
a
number
of
sources
other
than
the
transcripts
that
--
that
led
to
his
coy.
it
wasn't
developed
in
--
in
extent
so
but
--
but
it
is
on
the
record.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
clearly,
this
was
a
joint
legislative
committee
which
was
undertaking
a
rather
large
scale
investigation
of
an
executive
branch
of
government.
i
think
it's
completely
logical
that
there
are
a
number
of
witnesses
even
though
the
--
the
record
does
not
reveal
this,
a
number
of
witnesses
that
were
called,
a
number
of
sources
that
were
availed
off.
this
is
customary
in
an
investigation
of
this
type.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
at
that
time
it
was
quite
a
matter
of
notoriety.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
did
your
honor,
yes.
though
again
i
must
--
i
must
say
that
the
record
is
--
is
violent
of
--
of
reflections
of
as
to
what
the
nature
of
the
publicity
was.
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
this
case
was
part
of
the
publicity.
in
any
event,
it's
our
contention
that
the
--
that
the
questions
are
entirely
severable
on
their
facts
and
that
--
that
the
calling
of
the
witness
can
no
more
be
attributed
to
the
transcripts
than
to
any
other
independent
source
or
a
combination
of
them.
and
as
such,
even
if
--
if
this
court
feels
that
there
was
a
contamination
of
questions
which
were
predicated
upon
the
overheard
information,
that
such
contamination
would
not
extend
to
the
first
and
last
counts
of
the
information.
now,
it's
a
well-recognized
principle
stated
forcefully
in
the
costello
cases
and
other
places
that
where
a
judgement
is
sufficiently
supported
by
valid
counts,
the
judgement
will
stand,
regardless
of
other
counts
which
may
be
defective.
in
the
costello
case,
there
was
a
clear
contamination
of
certain
questions
which
were
asked
and
yet
that
contamination
did
not
in
fact
matters
which
were
derived
from
other
sources.
the
combination
of
these
two
principles
leads
to
the
result
than
in
the
instant
case,
there
can
be
no
doubt
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
there
was
--
there
was
--
that's
correct
your
honor.
there
--
what
--
what
--
what
was
involved
there
was
a
--
an
immigration
question
and
--
and
apparently
completely
unrelated
to
the
question
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
--
the
taps
did.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that
there
were
other
sources.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
there
is
--
there
is
testimony
hereto
which
is
similar
from
the
committee
counsel
which
i've
alluded
to
earlier
that
there
were
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
other
sources.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
he
did
not.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i
don't
know
that
there
was
any
identification
of
the
other
sources
in
the
costello
case
either
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that
it
was
--
i
have
the
opinion
to
guide
me
only
in
which
they
said
that
mr.
hogan
testified
that
there
were
other
sources
but
whether
they
were
identified
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
now,
it
--
it
might
be
that
there
was.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
now
that's
another
statement
that
was
made
by
counsel.
i
don't
know
where
he
gets
that
information
that
this
room
was
specially
tapped.
whether
there
was
an
eavesdropping
device
used
in
this
room
for
other
prisoners,
whether
it
was
used
for
other
visitors
for
this
particular
prisoner
and
so
forth
is
not
apparent
from
the
record.
when
he
said
that
it
was
a
trap
for
this
particular
petitioner,
i
must
say
i
was
startled.
i
don't
know
where
that
comes
from.
but
in
any
event,
clearly
there
was
at
that
time
a
general
inquiry
being
conducted
in
--
in
a
certain
amount
of
official
curiosity
as
to
the
nature
of
the
parole
of
--
of
joseph
lanza.
consequently,
it's
not
surprising
that
independent
agencies
of
--
of
the
government,
of
the
state
should
institute
their
own
investigatory
procedures,
one
of
which
was
apparently
to
overhear
these
conversations,
both
the
one
here
in
issue
and
others.
now,
i
alluded
earlier
to
the
fact
that
new
york
has
passed
a
law
which
has
made
this
a
felony.
now,
from
that
fact,
counsel
has
stated
here
that
the
state
of
new
york
committed
a
felony
in
order
to
convict
lanza
of
a
misdemeanor.
now
by
that
statement,
he
is
speculating
that
had
this
law
been
in
effect
at
the
time
which
it
was
not
that
there
could
have
been
an
authorization
obtained
ex
parte
from
a
court
for
the
use
of
the
eavesdropping
equipment
by
officials
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
that
could
have
been
made
out
and
therefore
that
there
would
have
been
a
violation
of
law
in
conducting
such
eavesdropping.
i
would
suggest
that
there's
absolutely
no
basis
for
that
speculation.
in
fact,
it's
quite
logical
to
infer
to
the
contrary
and
that
is,
had
we
have
this
law
on
the
books
at
that
time,
not
only
would
there
be
nothing
immoral
about
the
use
of
this
electronic
equipment
but
it
would
have
been
conducted
in
pursuance
to
the
statute
and
would
have
been
perfectly
lawful.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
there
was
a
constitutional
infraction
certainly.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
and
on
that
--
on
that
--
in
--
on
that
score,
counsel
has
urged
that
this
is
an
immoral
act
and
as
such
must
constitute
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
when
we
consider
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
certainly,
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
that
he
could
not
get
to
the
constitution
through
the
road
of
morality
because
in
this
very
instance
--
in
this
very
instance,
the
community
of
new
york
has
authorized
the
use
of
electronic
equipment
under
certain
supervised
conditions.
even
the
fourth
amendment
itself
of
course,
makes
no
absolute
prohibition
against
search
and
seizure
but
only
provides
that
unreasonable
search
and
seizures
are
conducted
without
appropriate
court
prior
adjudication
of
reasonable
grounds
are
multiple.
now
in
this
--
the
--
the
eavesdropping
section
which
is
now
the
law
of
new
york
indeed
quite
parallels
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
in
that
regard.
the
lawful
eavesdropping
must
be
conducted
by
means
of
an
ex
parte
order
obtained
from
a
court.
the
only
issue
then
is
under
these
circumstances,
could
there
have
been
one
if
there
had
been
that
law
in
effect.
now,
i
suggest
that
counsel
speculation
that
they
couldn't
have
been
unless
this
would
have
been
a
felony
under
the
law
as
was
subsequently
enacted,
is
a
pure
figment
of
his
imagination.
it's
not
based
upon
fact.
it's
pure
void
speculation.
in
fact,
under
the
present
instance,
the
--
the
statement
that
he
made
has
an
even
greater
vice
because
he
has
said
that
this
was
conducted,
that
this
intrusion
as
he
would
have
it
was
conducted
in
order
to
convict
lanza
of
a
misdemeanor.
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
case.
it
was
conducted
for
information
only.
it
was
used
not
to
convict
lanza
of
a
misdemeanor
or
to
convict
anybody
else
of
any
crime.
it
was
used
merely
in
order
to
facilitate
the
information
gathering
functions
of
a
valid
legislative
committee.
there
has
been
no
contest
here
as
to
the
subsequent
trial
at
which
the
petitioner
here
was
convicted.
there's
been
no
allegation
that
that
trial
in
any
way
failed
to
comport
with
constitutional
standards.
consequently
to
assert
that
this
was
an
act
which
was
committed
by
the
state
in
order
to
convict
the
petitioner
of
a
misdemeanor
is
a
gross
distortion
of
the
facts
of
the
case.
in
conclusion,
i
think
that
our
--
the
points
made
in
our
--
in
our
brief
are
tracing
this
issue
point-by-point
from
the
severabililty
of
the
questions
to
the
constitutional
right
or
a
jeopardy
in
--
inherent
in
the
proceedings
before
the
legislature
ultimately
back
to
what
occurred
in
that
prison
visitors'
room
will
demonstrate
that
there
was
at
no
time
during
the
course
of
this
investigation
any
action
by
the
state
which
in
anyway
trampled
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
and
on
that
we
rest.
thank
you.
