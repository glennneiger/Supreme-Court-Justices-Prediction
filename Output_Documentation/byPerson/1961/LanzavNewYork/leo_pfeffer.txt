mr.
leo
pfeffer
if
your
honors
please.
the
facts
of
this
case
insofar
as
they
are
constitutionally
pertinent,
i
think
are
uncontradicted
and
i
think
they're
undisputed.
the
brother
of
the
petitioner,
one
joseph
lanza
had
been
arrested
under
warrant
charging
him
with
violation
of
parole.
he
had
been
placed
in
jail
in
westchester
county
by
the
officials
of
state
of
new
york.
at
the
request
of
the
parole
board
officials,
an
electronic
recording
device
was
concealed
in
the
room
in
the
jail,
in
the
prison
which
was
used
by
the
prisoner
to
meet
and
consult
with
his
relatives,
his
friends
and
his
attorneys.
the
record
shows
and
this
is
pointed
out
for
some
reason,
in
the
people's
brief,
that
there
was
another
room
in
the
prison
which
was
set
aside
exclusively
for
attorneys
and
that
room
was
free
of
this
electronic
eavesdropping
device
but
obviously,
neither
the
prisoner
or
anybody
who
came
to
visit
him
could
select
the
room
in
which
he's
going
to
see
them
when
the
prisoner
--
and
when
the
wife
of
the
prisoner,
his
attorney
and
the
petitioner
here
and
his
brother
came
to
visit
him
on
separate
occasions,
he
was
brought
--
they
were
brought
into
this
room
where
the
electronic
device
had
been
planted
as
a
trap.
on
the
basis
of
this
electronic
device,
conversations
which
were
had
between
the
prisoner,
his
wife,
his
attorney
and
the
petitioner
here
and
his
brother
were
recorded.
thereafter,
the
pet
--
the
prisoner
was
released
on
parole
by
a
member
of
the
new
york
state
parole
board
and
the
circumstances
which
gave
rise
to
that
release
caused
a
state
investigating
committee
to
investigate.
in
the
course
of
this
investigation,
the
prisoner,
the
petitioner's
brother;
his
wife,
the
attorney
and
the
petitioner
herein
were
on
separate
occasions
called
before
the
investigating
committee
and
were
interrogated
regarding
any
efforts
which
they
have
been
--
might
have
made
to
use,
influence
or
corrupt
beings
to
obtain
the
restoration
of
parole
of
the
prisoner.
each
one
of
the
four
refused
to
answer
the
questions
put
to
them
by
the
committee.
no
action
was
taken
against
any
of
the
other
three
except
that
an
effort
was
made
to
punish
the
attorney
for
contempt.
but
that
was
dismissed
by
the
courts
and
no
--
nothing
further
was
done.
no
prosecution
was
brought
against
either
the
prisoner
himself,
the
petitioner's
brother
or
his
wife.
however,
the
petitioner
was
prosecuted
under
a
new
york
statute
which
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
punishable
by
imprisonment
for
up
to
one
year
for
refusal
to
ask
--
to
answer
a
pertinent
question,
a
material
of
proper
question
put
to
it
by
a
legislative
committee.
the
petitioner
was
tried
and
19
questions
had
been
put
before
him
by
the
counsel
for
the
legislative
committee.
he
refused
to
answer
each
one
of
these
questions.
he
was
--
and
that
had
been
prosecuted
on
19
separate
counts.
he
was
found
guilty
of
all
counts,
in
all
counts
but
the
--
and
sentenced
for
the
full
time
of
one
year
on
each
count.
but
tampering
justice
with
mercy
--
with
mercy,
the
sentencing
judge
provided
that
nine
of
the
sentences
would
be
served
concurrently
with
the
other
10
which
would
be
served
consecutively
so
that
he
was
sentenced
for
this
refusal
to
answer
on
the
base
of
this
one
short
conversation
with
sentence
to
10
years
in
prison.
the
appellate
division
affirmed
the
conviction
but
modified
the
judgement
by
reducing
the
sentence
to
one
year
stating
that
irrespective
of
whether
he
had
been
guilty
of
one
crime
or
19
crimes
or
any
amount
in
between.
as
a
matter
of
discretion
they
would
remove
--
reduce
the
judgement
to
be
served
for
--
to
one
year.
the
court
of
appeals
by
a
narrow
margin
of
four
to
three,
affirmed
the
conviction
although
it
modified
the
judgement
further
to
provide
that
only
one
crime
had
been
committed.
nevertheless,
it
said
that
the
appellate
division
had
indicated
in
his
discretion
that
--
that
matches
every
year
and
therefore,
didn't
change
the
actual
sentence
but
simply
declared
that
he's
been
guilty
of
only
one
crime.
three
of
the
judges
were
of
the
opinion
that
by
reason
of
the
circumstances
whereby
the
information
which
the
questioning
was
based,
these
questions
could
not
be
deemed
to
be
proper
whether
the
meaning
of
the
penal
law
which
provides
the
failure
to
answer
a
material
and
proper
question
constitutes
a
misdemeanor.
and
that
--
that's
my
state
--
well,
that
is
not
before
the
court.
contending
as
we
have
done
in
all
the
courts
below,
that
the
petitioner's
constitutional
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
fourth
amendment
that's
made
applicable
to
states,
the
fourteenth
had
been
violated,
we
sought
certiorari
and
certiorari
was
granted.
we
based
our
case
on
two
interrelated
contentions.
we
assert
that
by
reason
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
was
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law,
within
the
--
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
it
is
operated
by
its
own
terms.
second,
we
urged
that
this
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
new
york
would
if
it
had
been
committed
by
federal
officials
been
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
accordingly
it
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
in
either
case
whether
it's
fourteenth
amendment
by
reason
of
its
own
operation
or
by
reason
of
its
relationship
to
the
fourth,
renders
unusable
by
the
state.
the
information
gained
through
this
electronic
eavesdropping
device
and
that
any
questions
placed
thereon
could
not
be
or
shouldn't
answer
any
questions
based
thereon
could
not
be
the
subject
for
criminal
conviction.
now,
the
people
of
the
state
--
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
their
brief,
the
first
point,
urged
that
only
17
of
the
19
questions
were
corrupted
and
that
the
first
and
the
19th
which
were
general
questions,
which
simply
stated,
state
what
--
what
efforts
were
made
by
you
on
behalf
of
your
brother
is
the
first
question
and
the
second
question
was
--
the
first
question
was,
on
february
5th
1957,
your
brother
joseph
lanza
was
arrested
and
returned
to
prison,
charged
with
the
violation
of
parole,
told
the
commission
--
committee
please,
any
and
all
efforts
extended
by
you
to
assist
in
obtaining
the
release
of
your
brother
joseph
lanza
on
parole
or
the
restoration
of
his
parole.
that
was
the
first
question.
last
question
was
another
catch-all
general
question,
mr.
lanza,
please
tell
the
committee
the
name
of
anyone
with
whom
you
spoke
to
in
the
month
of
february
of
1957
about
the
restoration
of
the
parole
of
your
brother
joseph
lanza.
it's
our
contention
that
these
questions
are
as
corrupt
as
the
other
17.
that
but
for
the
fact
of
the
electronic
device,
there
would
have
been
never
any
occasion,
no
occasion
whatsoever
to
call
the
petitioner
herein
before
the
legislative
committee.
the
record
shows
that
the
petitioner
was
a
person,
a
responsible
businessman,
who
had
never
been
before
a
lower
court,
perhaps
maybe
a
traffic
violation
but
never
been
before
a
lower
court
much
less
having
a
criminal
record
of
any
kind.
he
had
no
bouts
with
the
law,
a
reputable
businessman.
his
only
relationship
to
the
petitioner
herein
and
to
the
controversy
was
in,
was
a
fact
that
he
was
a
brother.
now,
it
is
true
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
--
not
new
york
--
not
the
committee,
they
took
--
they
took
it.
it
was
done
by
the
parole
board
but
as
we
urged,
it's
a
same
respondent.
there's
only
one
respondent
here,
the
state
of
new
york.
and
that
the
--
the
--
and
we
quote
on
opinion
by
--
in
the
silverthorne
case
as
well
as
another,
is
the
fact
that
the
--
the
state
of
new
york
through
its
legislative
committee
took
advantage
of
the
electronic
eavesdropping
which
had
been
committed
by
the
parole
board,
in
effect
ratified
it,
made
it
part
of
this
as
itself.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
say
this
your
honor,
justice
harlan
that
if
the
legislative
committee
had
no
other
reason
to
call
him,
except
for
that
coerced
confession,
there
had
been
no
other
evidence
to
--
in
anyway
to
justify
as
being
called,
as
is
the
case
here,
i
would
say
that
he
could
--
that
he
would
be
immune
from
prosecution
for
refusing
to
answer
those
questions.
now,
the
--
the
state
of
new
york
in
its
brief
asserts
at
the
costello
case
authorizes
a
--
in
that
case,
it
was
a
deportation,
an
acquisition
based
upon
evidence
of
--
although
some
of
them
evidenced
was
obtained
through
illegal
wiretapping.
but
the
costello
case
very
carefully,
the
court
very
carefully
says
there
that
none
of
the
district
attorney's
questions,
none
not
one,
even
applies
that
he
had
ever
gained
this
information
from
the
1943
wiretaps.
costello
was
a
known
racketeer.
he
had
been
indicted.
the
public
records
showed
ample
justification
for
his
being
questioned
or
being
subject
to
the
--
to
the
proceedings.
nothing
there
was
--
nothing
which
was
gained
through
wiretap
was
used
against
costello
nor
was
the
proceeding
against
him
based
upon
the
wiretap.
here,
i
repeat
to
--
but
for
the
fact
that
the
wire
--
the
electronic
device
has
been
planted.
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
call
the
petitioner
to
the
legislative
committee
with
this
one
exception
from
this
--
the
people
bases
its
case
that
the
--
he
was
a
visitor
in
the
jail.
he
did
go
visit
his
brother
and
all
visitors
must
sign
a
register;
so
that
even
if
has
there
been
no
electronic
eavesdropping,
presumably,
the
records
of
the
visiting
would
be
available
to
the
parole
board
and
to
the
legislative
committee
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
they
would
have
called
him.
i
submit
your
honors
that
that
would
not
have
constituted
an
adequate
ground
on
the
light
of
the
--
of
the
tenor
of
cases
of
this
court
to
subpoena
the
defend
--
the
petitioner.
all
that
happened
was
that
a
brother
visits
his
brother
in
jail
one
time,
a
fraternal
act
which
is
explainable
as
a
natural
act
of
brotherly
affection,
brotherly
friendliness.
no
inference
can
arise
from
that
effect
which
would
justify,
which
justify
subpoenaing
this
defendant
--
this
petitioner,
before
the
legislative
committee.
so
that
is
--
we
believe,
we
believe
that
the
records
establishes
clearly.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
which
one,
the
first
one?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh,
did
you
visit
your
brother?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
and
he
refused
to
answer
whether
he
--
he
visits
his
brother?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
then
the
question
was
a
materiality
of
that.
i
--
i
think
that
would
--
that
could
not
be
--
no
commission
to
stand
because
there's
obviously
nothing
material
in
mere
visiting
one's
brother.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
didn't
state
--
it's
a
(inaudible)
--
there's
no
opinion
by
the
--
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
simply
affirmed
that
judgement
modifying
it
in
respect
to
the
--
respect
to
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
were
the
appellate
division,
the
appellate
division.
now,
it
did
so,
it
--
it
--
but
it
found
it
unnecessary
to
determine
whether
there
have
been
one
crime
or
19
crimes
and
presumably
on
the
basis
of
the
court
so
said
that
even
if
there
had
been
one
crime
committed
and
it
--
it's
held
in
the
appellate
division
that
--
it
bases
its
decision
on
that
fact
but
primarily
on
the
fact
that
evidence
illegally
acquired
under
new
york
law
is
nevertheless
admissible
in
the
criminal
proceeding
and
therefore
nevertheless
can
be
used
as
a
basis
for
an
investigating
committee.
this
was
the
justification,
the
primary
justification
both
of
the
trial
judge
and
the
appellate
division
that
the
immorality
of
the
acquisition
wasn't
technically
illegal,
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment,
at
the
time
it
was
committed,
it
was
not
technically
illegal
under
new
york
law.
but
the
immorality
of
the
acquisition
did
not
make
it
un
--
inadmissible
either
in
a
--
in
a
lower
court
or
in
a
legislative
committee.
now
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
he
was
asked
about
those
two
questions
and
he
said
he's
made
a
generalization
that
we
have
evidence
or
we
have
--
he
was
asked
that
--
he
stated
that
first
--
the
19th
question,
he
said
it,
the
first
of
the
19
questions
were
not
based
upon
the
illegally
or
immorally
obtained
evidence.
but
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
what
he
meant
by
that
was
that
they
had
access
to
the
prison
records
to
show
that
the
petitioner
has
visited
his
brother.
there's
nothing
other
than
that.
nothing
other
than
that
which
in
any
way
connects
the
petitioner
with
whatever
offense
may
have
been
committed
if
any.
now,
i
think
that's
quite
--
that's
quite
clear
from
the
whole
time
--
record.
that's
all
there
is
and
nothing
more.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
because
it
is
my
--
it
is
our
contention
that
the
mere
fact
of
visiting
a
brother
in
jail
would
not
sustain
--
would
not
sustain
in
ordinary
circumstances,
was
there
not
be
electronic
device,
the
electronic
eavesdropping,
a
mere
fact
that
one
man
visits
his
brother
in
--
in
prison
is
not
enough
to
justify
but
otherwise
would
be
a
dragnet
subpoena
before
a
legislative
committee.
this
is
an
act
--
this
is
an
act
which
is
explainable
by
non-criminal
or
non-immoral
motivations,
an
act
of
ordinary
conduct,
having
no
--
from
which
no
implications
of
any
misconduct
can
be
based,
visiting
a
brother
in
jail
once.
and
i
think
that
--
that
the
--
this
alone
would
have
not
supported
nor
would
have
been
ground
for
--
for
calling
him,
nor
with
the
district
attorney
called
him
merely
because
he
visited
his
brother
in
jail.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
(inaudible)
--
the
constitutional
issue
--
the
constitutional
question
i
am
urging
on
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
the
--
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
but
for,
but
for
the
electronic
eavesdropping,
he
would
never
been
called.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
would
make
the
same
question,
yes.
well,
we've
reached
this
--
oh,
i
merely
reached
this
court,
that
were
all.
i
don't
think
we'd
reach
this
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
it
was
never
necessary
--
it
was
never
necessary
for
the
parole
board
or
the
state
of
new
york
or
legislative
committee
to
examine
the
prison
records,
to
who
visited
him
because
they
had
the
electronic
eaves
--
device.
they
knew
from
that.
they
wouldn't
go
--
go
look
it
up
when
they
have
that.
perhaps
if
they
had
--
if
they
had
--
if
they
had
not
availed
themselves
of
the
electronic
device
and
had
gone
through
the
prison
records
and
found
that
the
visiting
and
hence
said
we
will
call
him.
we
might
have
had
a
different
case.
but
they
never
even
(inaudible)
to
that,
it
wasn't
that
necessary.
all
the
information
they
needed
or
felt
they
needed
was
gotten
through
this
electronic
eavesdropping
device.
they
never
have
consulted
the
--
the
prison
records.
there
was
no
need
for
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
--
i
think
mr.
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
from
the
questioning
put
to
--
to
the
counsel
for
the
committee
at
the
time
by
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
and
the
response
given
by
the
--
by
the
counsel.
it
was
quite
clear
that
what
he
--
that
he
was
absent
from
the
questions.
he
--
he'll
--
he
--
he
took
a
--
he
took
a
look
at
--
at
the
questions.
he
said
why,
number
one
does
not
specifically
refer
to
the
--
to
the
eavesdropping.
it
doesn't
make
specific
reference
as
the
others
do
to
the
eavesdropping.
the
others
they
said
--
when
you
said
so
and
so,
did
you
not
mean
so
and
so.
and
he
looks
at
--
say,
“well,
there's
nothing
about
it
in
--
in
number
one.
there's
nothing
about
the
number
19.”
he
picked
with
number
19
first,
showing
that
he
was
simply
glancing
through
it
and
he
basing
upon
a
fact
that
on
the
face
of
it,
it
showed
--
it
was
a
broad
general
question
and
the
question,
the
issue
is
whether
the
state
of
new
york
can
immunize
itself
by
sandwiching
in
a
first
and
last
question
which
on
the
face
appeared
to
be
general
and
unrelated
make
no
specific
reference
to
the
--
to
the
particular
eavesdropping.
but
nevertheless,
nevertheless
quite
clearly
grew
out
of
that
wrong.
again,
i
think
the
important
thing
to
note
is
that
but
for
the
eavesdropping,
but
for
the
eavesdropping,
it
is
unreasonable.
i
think
it's
inescapable
that
the
petitioner
would
never
have
been
before
that
legislative
committee.
i
think
that's
the
crux
of
the
issue.
now,
the
--
people
makes
the
argument
that
at
the
time
this
was
done,
there
was
no
law
against
the
electronic
eavesdropping
in
new
york,
true
enough.
but
this,
i
don't
think,
it's
certainly
not
conclusive
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
to
allow
judicial
review
of
conduct
which
is
immoral
even
if
it
is
not
illegal
under
state
law.
if
illegality
was
a
sole
test
and
obviously
the
state
could
immunize
--
immunize
itself,
some
of
our
passing
the
law,
committing
that
which
otherwise
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process.
but
i
think
it
is
extremely
significant
that
no
sooner
did
this
event
become
public
and
become
known
that
almost
immediately,
almost
immediately
a
statute
was
enacted
by
the
state
of
new
york,
making
this
conduct
criminal.
criminal
even
if
performed
by
a
state
official
in
the
language
which
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
a
precedent
for,
the
finding
--
persons
to
--
to
include
state
officials.
this
was
almost
an
involuntary
--
an
imp
--
reaction
based
upon
the
shocked
conscience
of
the
community.
and
i
think
it
is
significant
too
that
whereas
the
offense
for
which
the
defend
--
the
petitioner
herein
was
charged
was
a
misdemeanor.
the
evidence
or
the
--
of
--
upon
--
the
information
upon
which
his
conviction
was
based
was
--
the
opinion
that
it
was
made
a
felony.
the
state
of
new
york
committed
what
--
community
deemed
a
felony
in
order
to
convict
this
defendant
of
a
misdemeanor.
i
think
that
the
--
this
is
quite
significant
to
show
that
this
conduct
was
shocking
to
the
conscience
of
the
community.
now
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
as
far
it
directs
--
or
for
this
person,
him
alone,
it
was
a
trap
for
him,
there
--
the
--
record
shows
--
this
is
the
language,
as
a
request
of
the
parole
board,
a
trap
was
set
for
joe
lanza.
that's
--
that's
the
language
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
state.
now,
there's
--
one
further
point
on
this.
if
--
oh,
it
is
argued
by
the
people
that
the
--
that
this
--
what
was
shocking
about
this
was
the
interference
with
an
attorney-client
relationship.
in
one
of
the
cases,
in
one
case
it
was
an
attorney-client
relationship
which
was
involved
and
that
this
is
what
was
immoral.
this
is
what
was
protested.
but
it's
important
to
note,
it's
important
to
note
that
the
penal
law
which
made
this
criminal
did
not
limit
it
to
attorney-client
relationships,
did
not
say
as
it
did
in
another
case,
one
statute
--
one
provision
says
that
anybody
who
bugs,
this
is
the
language
which
is
used
in
the
--
back
in
the
--
in
the
trade.
anybody
who
use
it
--
plants
an
electronic
device
in
a
jury
room
is
guilty
of
a
separate
effects,
but
the
other
broad
statute
makes
no
reference
to
attorney
and
client.
any
electronic
eavesdropping
is
made
a
felony
whether
or
not
the
persons
are
in
a
relationship
of
attorney
and
client,
husband
to
wife,
brother
and
brother
or
complete
strangers.
the
offense
is
not
based
upon
the
relationship
between
the
persons
whose
conversations
was
overheard.
the
offense
is
based
upon
the
immoral
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
state
and
this
is
what
shocked
the
people
and
this
is
what
resulted
in
the
statute
being
enacted.
now,
there
is
a
double
offense
here.
this
was
offensive
because
in
here
there
was
in
effect
fraud.
there
was
in
effect
a
breach
of
a
fiduciary
relationship.
the
petitioner
here
was
a
--
in
the
true
sense,
a
literal
sense,
he
was
a
ward
of
the
state
of
new
york.
he
had
--
he
could
not
go
somewhere
else
and
say,
“i
will
talk
in
private
to
my
brother.”
he
could
--
he
could
only
go
where
the
state
of
new
york
allowed
him
to
go.
and
the
state
of
new
york
said,
“here,
you
can
talk
to
your
brother,
to
your
wife
and
to
your
attorney
over
here,
in
this
room
here.”
i
think
that
implicit
but
real
was
a
representation
there
that
you
can
talk
in
confidence
there,
that
you
can
talk
there
in
safety,
we
that
supplied
this
place
for
you
and
we
represent
to
you
that
it
is
safe.
now,
the
court
--
the
state
of
new
york
said,
“we're
not
going
to
let
you
talk
to
your
brother
or
your
attorney
and
your
wife
in
private.”
there's
going
to
be
a
stenographer
there.
he's
going
to
take
note
take
it
down.
he
would
know.
there
wasn't
that
thing.
there
was
just
naturally
the
prison
guard
who
stands
over
there
to
see
that
there's
no
--
no
concealed
weapons
or
anything
like
that
pass
but
who
does
nothing
--
overhear
the
conversation,
he
was
not
suppose
to.
and
--
and
that
constituted
in
our
view
a
misrepresentation
which
made
this
doubly
immoral.
now
my
associate,
mr.
fuchsberg
will
continue
and
we
will
reserve
10
minutes
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
(inaudible)
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
i
will
try
to
answer
as
many
of
the
questions
which
were
raised.
obviously,
i
can
only
touch
each
one
briefly.
the
question
was
asked
whether
the
trap
--
the
bugging
was
specifically
for
lanza,
was
simply
the
whole
room
was
bugged.
the
new
york
state
legislature,
new
york
joint
legislative
committee
on
privacy
of
communications
in
report
on
this
case,
stated
as
follows,
"as
the
request
of
parole
board
officers”
“bugging
trap"
was
set
for
lanza
and
his
family"
new
york
state
has
admitted
that
this
was
a
trap
set
exclusively
for
lanza
at
a
hearing
--
at
a
report
by
the
new
york
state
legislature
itself.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it's
cited
in
my
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
7
with
the
--
with
the
citation.
new
york
legislative
document
number
19th
--
1958
number
9,
page
24.
second
on
the
question,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
clark
raised
the
point
about
publicity,
was
an
act
of
publicity.
and
uviller
says,
yes
there
was
publicity
and
they
may
have
gotten
the
information
from
there.
well,
there
was
publicity
but
none
of
the
publicity
ever
mentioned
the
petitioner
until
he
was
called
before
the
legislative
committee.
now,
the
first
time
his
name
appeared
in
the
press
not
until
he
was
called
before
the
legislative
committee
on
the
basis
of
this
tap
--
this
tap.
question
was
asked
on
the
costello
case.
mr.
uviller
doesn't
remember
that
--
what
the
--
the
evidence
in
the
costello
case
other
than
the
wiretap.
the
opinion
state
specifically
that
costello
had
been
invited
and
the
--
and
the
--
the
testimony
in
the
indictment
was
one
of
the
factors
in
the
case
completely
independent
of
the
wiretapping.
besides
other
things,
public
records
--
the
--
the
court
first
of
public
records
which
was
told
and
testified
to
but
a
prior
indictments
so
that
--
and
says
completely
that
none
of
mr.
hogan's
questions
even
apply
to
the
--
even
gained
that
he
ever
gained
his
information
from
the
1943
wiretaps.
now,
on
the
independence
of
the
--
of
the
legislature
and
the
coordinate
facts
of
legislature,
that
has
belittled
that
there
might
considerably
be
a
greater
reluctance
on
the
part
of
court
with
the
fear
with
the
legislative
conduct
because
of
the
coordinative
branch.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
is
argued
unless
there
were
--
unless
there
were
an
independent
and
directly
show
that
there
were
independent
grounds,
if
that
bugging
never
occurred,
they
would've
still
called
him.
if
that
never
called
--
occurred
that
they
were
still
calling
then
they
might
have
called
him
but
not
asking
anything
which
came
out
of
the
bugging.
here,
there's
a
double
rule,
calling
out
the
questioning
exclusively
which
came
out
of
the
bugging.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
i
want
to
go
into
that
because
i
think
the
--
the
--
the
people
must
reveal,
have
kind
of
conceded.
they
conceded
the
point
i'm
just
making
that
the
constitution
does
not
protect
only
against
judicial
interventions
with
privacy
or
with
rights
that
the
legislature
too
is
subject
to
the
constitution.
certainly
in
the
case
of
a
state
legislature,
the
argument
the
coordinative
branch
made
very
well
have
some
validity
where
this
court
is
called
upon
to
pass
judgement
of
what
a
committee
of
the
congress
of
coordinate
branch.
but
we're
asking
you
to
pass
judgment
upon
the
state
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
used
the
word
state.
i
don't
need
to
--
to
spell
out
the
many
decisions
which
indicate
that
--
that
means
every
branch
of
the
state
is
equally
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
to
its
obligations.
now
mr.
uviller
has
admitted,
he
said
and
asked
the
question
that,
if
this
had
been
an
aggravated
violation
of
decency
and
morality,
that
important,
like
the
result
--
as
to
mr.
justice
black's
question,
if
there
had
been
torture
or
it
has
been
--
the
one
that
the
other
justice
asked
it,
had
been
broken
in
without
--
without
a
warrant.
that
even
there
that
there
--
even
the
legislature
could
not
use.
the
question
then
is,
in
what
category
are
to
we
view
this
action.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
can
answer
to
themselves.
they
have
passed
immediately,
spontaneously
a
law
saying,
“this
is
a
horrible
conduct.”
there
is
no
felony
in
new
york,
making
it
a
felony,
maybe
a
misdemeanor
--
maybe
something,
a
civil
wrong,
making
the
felony
for
a
police
officer
to
break
in
without
a
warrant.
but
it
is
a
felony
for
that
same
police
officer
to
bug
--
to
bug
a
--
a
person.
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
have
indicated
how
serious
they
consider
this
breach
of
decency.
they
have
passed
judgement
on
it.
all
we're
asking
is
at
this
point
give
sanction
to
this
judgement.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
that
if
we
assume
and
i
think
we
must
assume
that
law
is
a
means
whereby
the
people
translate
their
moral
judgements
into
effective
criteria,
then
we
must
say
and
if
we
assume
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
more
than
anyone
else
have
argued
that
it
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
translates
as
a
means
of
giving
effect
to
the
moral
standards
of
the
community,
then
i
think
the
question
answers
itself.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
--
more
is
advanced
mr.
justice
frankfurter
but
they
could
have
advanced
so
rapidly
that
the
statute
was
passed
within
i
think
less
than
two
months
after
this
occurred.
that
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
am
using
this
statute
mr.
justice
frankfurter
as
evidence
to
support
our
contention
that
even
were
there
no
statute,
were
there
no
statute,
this
would
equally
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
it.
i'm
saying
the
only
point
i'm
asserting
the
statute
is
a
strong
evidence
to
--
to
support,
to
support
my
view
that
this
constitute
immoral
conduct
if
we
accept
that
as
a
standard
for
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that's
entirely
true.
in
our
brief,
we
--
we
suggest
that
perhaps
this
might
be
a
good
time
for
the
court
to
reexamine
on
lee.
but
we
need
not
go
that
far.
we
need
not
go
that
far.
this
is
beyond
on
lee.
on
lee,
there
was
no
violation
of
a
fiduciary
relationship.
a
man
goes
into
a
store
like
a
business
visitor.
a
friend
is
carrying
this
--
this
little
concealed
microphone
in
there.
there
is
no
violation
of
a
representation
in
effect.
here,
the
--
there
was
nothing
which
if
--
if
the
defendant,
now
he
did
not
want
to
talk
to
him
there,
he
could
have
gone
elsewhere.
here,
he
could
not
escape
--
he
could
not
escape
the
bugging.
he
could
not
go
out
and
say
i'll
talk
to
you
somewhere
in
my
own
home
or
somewhere
else.
here,
the
state
of
new
york,
through
its
official
offices,
set
a
trap
and
this
was
exactly
the
words
of
the
state
of
new
york,
they
used
the
word
trap,
a
bugging
trap,
this
was
a
trap.
i
think
this
goes
beyond
--
this
goes
beyond
on
lee.
and
for
the
same
reason,
for
the
same
reason,
i
think
this
is
analogous
to
silverman
even
though
technically
there
was
no
physical
intrusion.
there's
no
magic
in
physical
intrusion.
there's
nothing
magic
effect
that
--
that
a
wall
was
--
was
spiked
a
half
inch.
the
court
refused
in
silverman
to
say
that
this
constituted
a
trespass
within
the
meaning
of
the
common
law
of
trespass
but
refused
to
base
it
upon
that.
the
act
was
wrong,
it
was
wrongful,
was
immoral.
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
is
nothing
magic
in
the
fact
that
in
on
lee
--
in
goldman,
they
spiked
a
half
inch
or
a
quarter
of
an
inch
into
a
wall,
whereas
here,
they
bugged
a
trap
in
the
precinct
room
--
in
a
business
room
in
the
prison.
i
think
this
is
at
(inaudible)
--
at
least
equally
wrong
and
at
least
equally
a
--
inconsistent
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
inconsistent
with
the
principles
and
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
of
course
by
the
basis
--
on
the
basis
of
mapp,
it
is
therefore
unusable
by
the
state
of
new
york,
unusable,
not
merely
in
the
criminal
proceeding
but
unusable
by
any
part
of
the
state
of
new
york.
there
is
in
one
reason
why
i
suggest
that
such
be
in
the
strictest
standards
as
far
as
this
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
yes,
couldn't
they
ask
questions
basically,
yes.
now,
in
the
case
of
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
said
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
if
they
summoned
him
on
the
witness
on
the
basis
of
this
tap,
the
answer
is
i
believe
that
they
could
not
do
so.
they
could
not
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
immunity
is
not
--
is
not
the
issue
here.
he
is
not
asserting
that
he
would
be
--
that
he's
filed
his
rights
under
--
under
self-incrimination
are
being
violated.
he's
asserting
his
right
on
a
completely
independent
constitutional
provision,
the
fourth
amendment
which
is
as
forceful
in
its
sphere
as
the
fifth
amendment,
in
this
sphere.
now,
if
in
the
case
of
use
of
evidence
in
the
criminal
proceeding
which
is
illegally
be
obtained,
i'm
arguing
could
have
made
or
have
been
made
in
the
courts
that
when
you
have
to
weigh
the
competing
values
as
between
whether
a
person
commits
the
crime
should
be
free
from
the
just
it
asserts
as
against
the
state's
avoidance
of
using
illegal
means.
a
reasonable
argument
(inaudible)
--
that
the
--
of
the
lesser
of
the
two
evils
is
that
the
state
should
use
it
--
the
criminal
--
the
bad
evidence
and
that
the
defendant
should
not
go
scot
free.
here,
no
crime
was
committed.
nobody
was
invited,
nobody
was
prosecuted.
the
only
prosecution
here
is
a
refusal
to
answer
the
question.
were
there
no
refusal
to
answer
a
question,
there'd
been
no
crime.
nobody
was
indicted
for
answering,
nobody
--
as
far
as
the
record
show,
as
far
as
any
conduct
by
a
state
of
new
york
is
concern
--
concerned,
there
was
no
crime
committed
by
nobody
at
all.
therefore,
you
don't
have
to
come
to
really
--
count
of
competing
value,
shall
we
allow
crimes
to
be
unpunished.
this
is
not
involved
here.
i
think
--
oh,
mr.
uviller
said
that
if
the
statute
had
been
enacted,
the
people
could
have
gone
and
gotten
permission
leave
from
a
judge
to
plant
the
wire,
this
tap,
this
bugging
trap.
i
think
that
begs
that
whole
issue.
i
think
we
have
to
assume
if
we
are
correct
in
our
contention
that
this
was
immoral
conduct,
now
if
we're
incorrect
of
course,
enforced
the
case
on
that
basis
or
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
if
this
is
not
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
not
moral
conduct
then
we're
not
in
court.
but
if
we
are
correct
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
if
this
was
a
moral
conduct
then
we
must
assume
that
no
judge
would
have
permitted
it.
the
judge
could
not
have
made
moral
that
which
is
immoral
nor
made
immune
from
the
force
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
which
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
--
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
black
that
i
would
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
yes,
yes.
i
would
prefer
for
my
part
to
say
that
if
the
judge
found
that
this
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
go
that
he
would
not
--
not
only
couldn't
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
points
out,
but
is
--
we
must
assume
he
would
not
have
granted
permission
for
it
since
that
permission
would've
been
futile
and
i
--
we
must
assume
that
he
would
not
have
authorized
to
do
that
which
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it's
only
because
wiretapping
is
held
by
this
court
not
to
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
simply
statutorily
prohibited
that
presumably
a
--
a
statute
can
provide
that
if
you
get
permission
from
a
judge
or
if
the
attorney
general
allows
it
then
it
could
be
--
it
--
it
is
permissible.
but
if
as
in
this
case,
we
assume
that
the
conduct
here
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it's
our
assertion
that
no
judge
would
have
or
could
have
granted
the
permission
to
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
--
that
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it's
in
--
the
reason
--
well,
this
case
is
here
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
that
the
new
york
courts
did
not
know
of
mapp.
they
assumed
on
the
basis
of
new
york
decisions
that
the
fact
that
evidence
is
procured
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
a
violation
of
any
other
constitutional
provision
does
not
make
the
--
does
make
the
evidence
unusable.
it's
--
this
as
a
court
is
quite
possible
that
had
the
court
that
had
the
benefit
of
mapp,
it
would
--
we
would
not
be
here.
but
the
issue,
the
court
which
--
the
court's
decision,
the
appellate
court's
decisions,
the
whole
argument
is
that
fact
that
the
--
the
(inaudible)
of
the
acquisition
whether
it's
immorality
or
whether
it's
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
that's
not
important
for
this
--
at
this
moment.
the
(inaudible)
of
the
acquisition
does
not
make
the
--
the
fruits
of
the
acquisition
unusable.
mapp
has
shown
that
it
does.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
except
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
was
not
the
new
york
law.
the
new
york
law
permitted
this
evidence.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
exactly,
yes
your
honor,
yes
sir.
well,
i
think
that
i
have
sought
to
answer
i
believe
those
points
which
have
been
raised
which
i
--
are
most
troublesome.
the
rest
i
believe
are
briefs
--
speaks
for
itself.
thank
you
very
much.
