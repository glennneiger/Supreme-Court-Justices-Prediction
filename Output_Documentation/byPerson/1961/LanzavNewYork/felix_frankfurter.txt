how

how
did
the
grant,
the
so-called
grant
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
get
into
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
committee
informed
of
the

(inaudible)
the
witness,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
specifics
(inaudible)
is
the

(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
--
thereafter

thereafter,
(inaudible)
thereafter,
he
maybe
prosecuted
for
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
eavesdropping
is
not
(inaudible)
it's
not
an
intrusion
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
(inaudible)
eavesdropping
as
such,
it
is
not
on
the
intrusion
of
the
constitutionally
protected
area
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
goldman
makes
the
point
it
was
clearer
because
that
involves
fourth
amendment
as
it's
such.
it
was
held
that
there
was
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
whom
--
on
whom
would
they
be
(inaudible)
that's
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
i
would
take
--
i
would
take
the
second
half
of
the
test
in
response
to
that
and
that
is
was
this
is
a
protected
area
which
was
intruded
upon
if
there
was
an
intrusion.
and
with
respect
to
that,
i
would
definitely
and
definitively
say,
no
it
was
not.
and
i
would
--
i
would
recall
to
the
court
as
cited
in
our
brief,
the
fact
that
the
laws
of
new
york
provide
that
in
a
prison,
no
prisoners
to
converse
with
any
other
person
except
in
the
presence
and
under
the
supervision
and
surveillance
of
an
official
of
the
prison.
after
all
the
prison
is
not
a
man's
castle.
prison
is
by
design
if
not
by
nature.
justice

(inaudible)
justice

this
is
--
it
isn't
(inaudible)
justice

(voice

include

from

(inaudible)

(inaudible)

(inaudible)
attorney
and
client
relationship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
--
would
make
a
difference
with
you,
whether
the
original
illegality
was
hardly
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
counsel
has
made
or
examined?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
not
--
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
keep
that
position
or
was
there
equivocation
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
you
know
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
his
testimony
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
on
which
it
(inaudible)
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
been
suggested
throughout
this
litigation
that
the
committee
was
constitutionally
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
could
ask
him
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
answer
that
he
gave
is
(inaudible)
to
complicate
this,
if
relevant
to
the
judgment
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
on
the
matter
of
(inaudible)
information
might
have
come
to
him
otherwise
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
in
taking
that
--
surely
of
misconduct
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
(inaudible)
constitutional
infraction
of
statutory
privilege?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
couldn't
get
there,
there's
no
statute
on
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
--
you
think
that
whenever
the
new
york
legislature
passes
(inaudible)
certain
conducts
and
holding
superior
punishment
for
disobedient
of
this
new
statute,
would
that
prove
that
that
--
that
conduct
prior
(inaudible)
was
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
--
my
(inaudible)
a
statute
passed
by
new
york
which
proves
that
there
before
that
(inaudible)
of
the
community
or
even
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
i
still
ask
you
whether
the
fact
that
any
state
passes
a
statute
(inaudible)
certain
conduct
to
prove
that
that
conduct
prior
to
that
statute
of
the
--
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
because
if
it's
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
if
it's
that
fact
and
i
don't
think
a
statute
can
say
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
standard
of
due
process
as
to
what
new
york
does
is
what
is
done
generally
throughout
the
country.
i'd
have
(inaudible)
how
many
states
have
such
a
statute
but
(inaudible)
conduct.
we've
had
(inaudible)
we've
had
goldman.
we've
had
(inaudible)
etcetera,
etcetera.
we
have
the
law
(inaudible)
doesn't
offend
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
of
the
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
was
your
argument.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)nobody
should
have
decided
anything
except
to
say
this
(inaudible)
the
court
provided
in
the
constitution,
provided
in
the
constitution
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
this
ground
in
which
the
new
york
--
the
new
york
courts
could
draw,
one,
the
question
of
materiality
is
dealt
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
that
was
the
new
york
law.
it
didn't
have
to
bother
about
anything
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
said
that
was
the
new
york
law
which
was
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
was
of
course
the
obvious
ground
obviously
so
that
it
is
(inaudible)
