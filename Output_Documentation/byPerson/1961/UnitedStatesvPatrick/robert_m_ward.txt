mr.
robert
m.
ward
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like,
at
the
outset,
to
say
without
quibbling
that
on
pages
9,
16,
27,
34
and
39
of
the
government's
brief,
they
state
and
they
argue
a
proposition
which
is
in
error,
which
is
based
on
factual
error.
i
had
hoped
that
i
would
not
have
to
mention
it
because
it
did
not
appear
to
be
too
material,
but
the
government
has
now
indicated
that
one
of
the
strong
points
in
their
case
with
us
is
the
question
of
whether
these
were
capital
expenditures.
so,
my
objection
to
a
part
of
what
appears
in
the
government's
brief,
i
think
the
court
should
know.
the
government
says
in
its
brief
--
mr.
robert
m.
ward
page
9,
page
16,
page
27,
page
34
and
39.
i
can
--
i
can
briefly
summarize
it
for
you
if
you
please.
the
government
says
that
this
28%
of
the
stock
which
belong
to
the
taxpayer's
wife
was
purchased
by
him.
and
then,
at
several
of
those
points
--
places,
they
say
that
he
could
sell
it.
and
at
one
place,
they
say,
that
all
of
this
28%
plus
all
of
his
stock
passed
to
his
children
at
his
death
under
this
agreement.
now,
the
fact
is,
as
shown
by
page
11
of
the
patrick
record,
which
is
the
original
agreement
between
the
parties,
the
fact
is
that
the
taxpayer
paid
the
full
market
value
for
this
28%
of
the
stock
that
is
$112,000
of
blue
chip
stocks.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
m.
ward
paid
a
--
paid
a
fair
market
value
as
determined
by
offers
made
for
the
paper
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes,
sir.
now,
he
paid
that
value
for
it,
but
he
obtained
only
the
nominal
ownership
of
that
stock,
only
the
voting
rights
of
that
stock
and
it
is
provided
specifically
at
page
11
of
the
patrick
record
that
he
could
not
sell
the
stock,
that
should
any
--
say,
all
of
--
all
of
the
stock
of
herald
publishing
company
be
about
to
be
affected,
that
he
must
first
transfer
the
stock
to
his
children,
they
would
effect
the
sale
and
they
would
receive
the
proceeds.
now,
that
point
may
appear
obscure
at
the
moment,
but
in
actuality,
you
can
see
that
that
is
material
to
some
degree
to
the
present
argument
of
the
government,
that
these
expenditures
on
behalf
of
this
taxpayer
were
capital
in
nature
and
their
implications
of
those
statements
that
are
also
material
to
other
points
to
the
case.
i
pass
it
on
because
in
the
ultimate,
it
may
not
be
too
material
by
the
time
we
have
looked
at
the
case
a
little
bit,
but
those
--
that
statement
is
in
error
that
he
could
sell
the
stock.
it's
an
error
that
he
acquired
it
outright
in
full.
in
--
just
to
refer
to
it
as
a
purchase,
it's
not
quite
enough
and
to
--
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes,
sir.
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes,
sir.
and
now
you
see
that
--
mr.
robert
m.
ward
he
purchased
it
but
it
requires
--
mr.
robert
m.
ward
--
this
other
qualification
when
you
consider
the
question
of
capital
gains
because
there
is
a
suggestion
of
capital
expenditures,
there
is
a
suggestion
that
he
had
sometime
in
the
future
could
take
some
tax
advantage
of
these
fees
which
is
not
correct
under
the
--
under
the
proper
statement
of
the
record.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes,
sir.
that's
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
m.
ward
automatically,
it
says
by
operation
of
this
thing.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
he
would
transfer
it
first
to
them
--
mr.
robert
m.
ward
--
and
they
would
(voice
overlap)
the
savings,
yes
sir.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
was
handed
a
--
by
counsel
for
the
government,
a
copy
of
the
memorandum
with
respect
to
the
treasury
regulations
on
yesterday
after
that
was
used
in
the
gilmore
case.
that
had
not
been
used
in
the
courts
below
nor
was
it
in
brief
in
this
case.
the
effect
of
it
only
is
to
say
again
that
no
attorney's
fees
in
divorce
actions
are
deductible
as
i
see
it.
now,
we
can
avoid
considerable
verbiage
on
that
point
because
we
agree
--
we
agree
that
attorney's
fees
in
divorce
actions
as
such
are
not
deductible.
we
say
that
divorce
--
that
fees
that
are
paid
in
a
divorce
action
as
such
are
personal
in
nature
and
are
not
deductible.
we
did
not
deduct
divorce
fees
in
this
case.
the
divorce
fees
in
this
case
were
allocated
for
the
divorce
or
separated
from
the
--
the
non-business
expenses
and
no
claim
for
their
deduction
was
made.
we
do
say,
however,
that
a
divorce
clearly
may
be
the
occasion
for
other
fees
which
are
deductible.
now,
as
we
look
at
section
212
subparagraph
(2),
it
is
--
a
taxpayer
is
permitted
to
deduct
non-business
expenses
and
non-business
is
simply
--
maybe
a
misnomer
but
that's
the
title
the
statute
gives
it.
now,
how
do
we
determine
whether
they
are
in
this
category
or
not?
at
page
7
of
the
patrick
brief,
we
have
taken
a
look
at
lykes
against
the
united
states
in
which
this
court
cited
in
particular
the
house
committee
reports
and
the
senate
committee
reports
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
this
legislation.
for
the
purpose
of
dividing
the
congressional
policy
of
legislative
intent,
the
court
examined
these
reports
thoroughly
and
then
this
lykes
case,
we
think
spell
out
a
good
guide
to
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
these
are
non-business
expenses
and
deductible.
it
said
that
the
expenses
in
--
incurred
in
a
sport
or
a
hobby
or
a
recreation
clearly
are
not
non-business
expenses.
it
goes
no
further.
it
says,
however,
that
they
must
be
ordinary
and
necessary,
reasonable
in
amount
and
must
bear
a
reasonable
and
proximate
relation
to
the
production
of
income
or
the
management,
conservation
or
maintenance
of
income.
in
this
case,
the
government
to
this
point
has
never
questioned
that
these
expenses
were
ordinary
and
necessary
and
reasonable
in
amount.
in
fact,
the
circuit
court,
at
page
62
of
the
patrick
record,
comments
on
the
fact
that
the
government
has
not
raised
that
question.
the
question
is
whether
these
fees
were
reasonably
and
proximately
related
to
the
management
conservation
or
maintenance
of
income-producing
property.
we
see
that
as
being
the
only
true
test
whether
they're
reasonably
or
proximately
related.
now,
in
this
case,
the
district
court,
sitting
without
a
jury,
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
these
specific
fees
that
were
claimed
as
they
were
allocated
and
as
they
were
set
up,
were
in
fact
direct
or
reasonably
and
proximately
related
to
the
management
conservation
and
maintenance
of
income-producing
property.
and
we
--
we
cite
you
again
the
--
the
trust
of
bingham
case
which
is
already
been
mentioned
here
this
morning,
we
have
it
on
page
6
of
our
brief,
in
which
this
court
has
said
that
the
court
below
could
find
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
the
question
of
reasonableness
and
proximity
that
that
was
a
question
for
the
trier
of
the
facts.
and,
in
that
particular,
may
i
indicate
to
the
court
that
on
page
6
near
the
bottom
of
the
page
where
i
have
cited
(inaudible)
against
bingham,
the
printers
have
dropped
out
a
line
which
is
very
obvious.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes,
sir.
just
above
the
--
the
paragraph
numbered
(b),
as
--
and
we
cannot
say
as
a
matter
of
law
that
such
acts,
it
stops
there.
such
expenses
are
any
less
deductible
than
expenses
of
suits
to
recover
income.
there's
a
line
dropped
there
which
is
obvious.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
after
the
district
court,
sitting
as
a
judge
and
the
jury,
had
carefully
examined
these
specific
fees
and
had
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
they
were
reasonably
and
proximately
related,
the
circuit
court
affirmed
his
decision
and
on
6
--
page
67
of
the
patrick
record,
it
had
this
to
say,
in
view
of
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
and
the
undisputed
testimony
in
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
who
was
the
taxpayer,
we
are
to
review
the
legal
fees
in
the
amount
of
$19,200
which
were
paid
by
the
taxpayer
for
the
protection
and
conservation
of
his
income-producing
property,
were
properly
deductible
as
claimed.
so
that
the
finding
of
fact
has
been
made
by
the
trier
of
facts
and
affirmed
here
on
the
ba
--
on
that
basis.
now,
may
i
inquire
as
to
what
facts
the
district
court
considered?
the
--
the
district
court
heard
the
facts,
the
testimony
from
the
witnesses,
that
mr.
patrick,
the
taxpayer
here,
was
editor
and
publisher
of
a
newspaper.
they
have
--
there
is
in
the
record
evidence
that
he
had
built-up
that
newspaper,
that
that
was
a
part
of
his
life
work,
that
he
was
engaged
in
making
it
a
more
valuable
and
more
worthwhile
business
property
and
that's
in
the
record.
the
publication
of
a
small
newspaper
is
a
--
something
rather
personal
and
of
great
deal
of
meaning
to
an
individual
if
i
may
say.
now,
to
what
subject
did
these
legal
fees
that
we
are
claiming
as
deductible
relate?
how
directly
were
they
related
to
matters
which
might
be
called
non-business
expenses
under
it?
there
was
$3200
in
fees
for
the
handlement
--
the
handling
by
the
attorneys
of
the
business
real
estate.
now
that
business
real
estate
was
not
just
real
property
somewhere.
that
business
real
estate
was
the
building
occupied
by
the
publishing
company
and
in
which
the
newspaper
was
published.
by
the
planning
and
the
work
of
counsel
in
this
case,
the
undivided
interest
of
the
wife
and
the
husband
in
this
building
were
placed
in
a
trust,
and
most
importantly,
a
long-term
lease
was
negotiated
which
assured
the
use
of
that
building
by
the
publisher
and
if
i
--
i
hope
i'm
not
transgressing
the
record
when
i
say
that
this
is
a
small
town
in
which
the
taxpayer
liaison
in
which
i
laid
up,
and
that
building
suitable
for
the
publication
of
the
newspaper
of
this
sort
are
not
found
readily
on
every
corner.
that
was
one
of
the
elements
to
which
these
fees
relate.
does
that
sound
like
a
personal
expense?
the
other
was
the
28%
of
the
stock
which
was
held
at
this
time
by
the
taxpayer's
wife.
to
this
point,
the
taxpayer
had
act
--
had
exercised
actual
control
of
the
publishing
venture
by
sufferance
of
his
wife
and
his
children
because
he
was
simply
a
minority
stockholder.
at
this
point,
it
was
a
matter
of
his
business
interest,
not
a
personal
matter,
but
a
matter
of
his
business
interest,
that
he
had
legal
control
since
the
marital
relationship
was
to
be
dissolved.
the
record
shows
that
there
were
prospects
for
sale
of
the
business,
this
business
which
he
had
been
building
up
and
which
he
had
been
building
into
a
--
a
substantial
business
property.
that
was
the
manner
in
which
the
value
of
the
stock
was
arrived
at
as
a
result
of
offers
which
had
been
made
for
the
purchase
of
the
business.
it
was
to
his
business
interest
to
retain
control
of
the
publication,
the
publishing
company
and
the
newspaper,
by
virtue
of
a
legal
control
rather
than
the
control
by
sufferance
which
would
have
gone.
now,
we
have
seen
as
i
had
to
state
at
the
outset,
i
thought,
that
actually
he
acquired
only
nominal
ownership
of
the
stock.
that
as
a
result
of
this
arrangement,
which
was
not
easy,
because
there
are
accountant,
counsel
employed
by
both
of
the
parties
and
the
record
shows
that
one
of
the
most
difficult
parts
from
a
legal
standpoint
was
to
rearrange
the
stock
ownership
of
this
corporation,
generally
to
provide
for
the
--
the
children
of
the
parties
but
to
do
it
in
such
a
manner
as
was
acceptable
to
both
of
the
parties
without
disrupting
completely
the
economic
structure
of
the
--
of
the
taxpayer.
he
could
not
sell
that
stock.
he
cannot
sell
that
stock.
he
has
simply
the
--
the
use
of
it
during
his
lifetime.
now,
the
government,
as
the
record
will
show
in
the
trial
of
this
case
and
it's
been
mentioned
here
today,
made
a
good
deal
of
the
fact
that
the
income
which
the
taxpayer
derived
from
his
position
with
the
newspaper
and
the
dividends
which
he
derived
form
that
stock,
were
in
actuality
less
than
half
of
his
total
income.
but
to
make
a
point
of
that
no
certain
facts
of
life
that
the
record
shows
that
the
interest
of
the
taxpayer,
mr.
patrick,
was
--
had
been
devoted
to
building
up
a
property
that
that
was
the
true
value
of
the
paper
to
him,
to
building
up
property
not
the
immediate
return.
and
furthering,
we
think
this
is
most
significant
that
aside
from
his
salary
from
the
herald
publishing
company
and
his
dividends,
most
of
the
rest
of
his
income
at
that
time
came
from
stocks,
bonds
and
so
on
from
other
investment
property.
a
good
part
--
some
of
it
at
least,
also
came
from
the
rental
of
this
building.
now,
when
this
settlement
was
effected
and
he
had
divested
himself
of
the
building
and
he
had
traded
these
blue
chip
stocks,
the
income-producing
value
of
the
publishing
company
became
more
and
more
important
to
him.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
at
page
49
of
the
patrick
record,
the
district
court
examined
the
clear
allocation
of
fees
made
in
this
case.
the
district
court
on
hearing
the
testimony
and
the
evidence,
found
that
$3200
in
fees
were
charged
for,
allocated
to
and
paid
for
services
rendered
by
counsel
in
settling
division
of
real
estate
and
so
on
and
that
they
were
deductible
as
non-business
expense.
the
court
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
$16,000
was
charged
for,
allocated
to
and
paid
for
the
services
of
counsel
in
negotiating
the
--
the
rearrangement
of
the
stock.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
court
is
asked
to
use
any
rule
of
thumb
or
any
percentage
or
where
any
speculation
as
to
such
part
of
the
fees
as
or
non-business,
the
non-business
expenses
were
clearly
separated
by
counsel
in
billing
here
and
were
charged
as
such.
these
fees
were
not
expended,
may
it
please
the
court,
to
resist
or
to
compromise
liability.
they
were
expended
for
the
purpose
of
cons
--
of
managing
and
we
submit
that
managing
is
a
broad
word,
of
managing
--
managing
and
conserving
this
specific
income-producing
property
that
we're
speaking
of.
it
was
--
these
expenses
were
a
business-type
expense,
and
we
borrow
that
word
from
the
government's
brief,
they
were
business-type
expense.
on
these
facts
that
you
heard
here,
how
could
it
have
been
found
that
they
were
personal
in
nature?
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
--
mr.
robert
m.
ward
the
--
the
parties
were
the
officers
and
directors
of
this
corporation.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes,
sir.
the
children
were
also
stockholders
and
involved.
one
of
them
was
the
secretary
of
the
corporation.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
well,
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
--
the
party
you
get
from
england
and
here
you
get
to
france,
it's
got
to
be
either
business
or
--
or
personal
that
it's
somewhere
in
an
area.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
well
--
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
your
honors,
i
--
i
should
like
to
comment
now
on
the
second
point
that
is
made
in
this
case
that
has
not
been
touched
on,
that
is
the
government's
contention,
that
under
no
circumstances
were
fees
paid
to
counsel
for
the
wife,
deductible.
we
say
in
that
particular
that
we
think
that
the
fees
paid
to
the
attorneys
for
the
wife,
again
fall
within
our
basic
premise,
that
they
were
expended
for
a
purpose
reasonably
and
proximately
related
to
the
conservation,
management
of
income-producing
property,
that
their
purpose
itself
was
a
deductible
one
and
that
this
taxpayer
had
a
legal
duty
to
pay
those
not
only
by
virtue
of
the
requirement
that
he
was
subject
to
his
--
to
the
liability
for
his
wife
necessarily
but
because
the
court
in
it's
final
order,
directed
that
he
pay
all
counsel
fees.
the
--
the
divorce
action
itself
had
--
mr.
robert
m.
ward
--
the
diff
--
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
mr.
justice,
if
i
may
say
this,
the
record
will
indicate
that
the
--
the
property
settlement
aspects
which
are
the
only
things
in
which
were
claiming
fees
--
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
these
were
settled
--
mr.
robert
m.
ward
these
were
settled
separate
and
apart
from
the
divorce
action.
all
that
the
divorce
decree
did
since
the
original
suit
had
asked
a
property
settlement,
it's
simply
ratified
it.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
presumably
so.
we
don't
know
that
because
these
parties
might
have
decided
to
separate
their
business
interests
without
a
--
a
divorce.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
we
feel
though
also
that
the
--
while
the
divorce
does
furnish
the
occasion,
that
there
can
be
involved
fees
which
are
separate
and
distinct
from
those
in
the
divorce
itself.
yes.
now,
if
i
may
make
one
further
point.
the
owens
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
was
a
most
peculiar
one
because
there,
the
same
counsel
acted
for
both
parties
by
agreement,
consents.
there,
the
payment
of
the
wife's
fee
was
approved
by
the
fifth
circuit.
that
sounds
to
be
very
bad
authority
or
little
authority
for
anybody
and
yet,
oddly
enough,
may
it
please
the
court,
as
shown
by
page
44
of
the
patrick
record,
counsel
for
the
wife
and
the
--
and
the
husband,
when
they
came
to
this
area
in
which
we're
claiming
fees,
had
as
they
say,
almost
joint
aims.
now,
i
--
i
state
it
in
the
brief
and
i
reiterate
that
there's
no
question
of
impropriety
about
that
at
all,
but
that
under
these
circumstances,
it
was
difficult
for
--
to
work
out
these
arrangements
and
that
counsel
had
almost
joint
aims.
now,
all
as
--
all
i'm
--
i'm
suggesting
there
is
that
here
was
a
case
which
was
not
inconsistent
with
the
baer
case.
here
was
a
case
which
contains
some
elements
of
the
baer
case
and
oddly
enough,
although
i
thought
i'd
never
see
it
happen
again,
contains
some
elements
of
the
owen
--
owens
case
which
is
one
case
with
authority
for
payment
of
the
wife
--
allowing
the
wife's
fees.
that
being
the
case,
i
reiterate
that
the
deductibility
of
these
particular
fees
of
ours
hinges
on
the
activity
and
that
the
trial
court
who
heard
all
of
these
oddly
related
facts
in
detail,
has
said,
as
a
--
as
a
question
of
fact,
has
precluded
that
as
a
question
of
fact
that
they
were
in
truth
reasonably
and
proximately
related.
on
that
basis,
we
think
the
holdings
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hope
that
there
is
no
confusion
in
the
minds
of
the
court
that
what
we're
trying
now
is
mr.
patrick's
case
and
i
represent
mr.
patrick.
the
name
gilmore
has
been
used
several
times
both
in
the
argument
and
the
footnotes
in
the
brief
in
this
case
and
i
know
it's
inadvertence
but
i
want
the
court
to
be
very
clear
that
i'm
representing
mr.
patrick.
now,
at
the
outset,
let
me
make
two
or
three
quick
preliminary
observations.
one,
that
counsel
for
the
government
twice
made
the
statement
that
this
newspaper
was
founded
by
mrs.
patrick's
father
and
that
it
was
her
father's
paper
which
is
not
in
the
record
and
happens
not
to
be
true.
and
that's
not
material,
i'm
quite
sure
here
but
it
is
--since
it's
been
repeated
twice
for
whatever
work
it
has,
i
want
to
indicate
that
that
is
not
correct
nor
does
it
appear
at
any
point
in
the
record.
now,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
take
what
may
appear
to
be
a
very
elementary
position
but
one
which
i
think
this
court
should
consider.
we
think
we're
here
on
a
question
of
fact.
we
think
we've
been
brought
to
this
court
on
what
amounts
to
a
question
fact
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
courts
below
can
be
reversed
without
actually
changing
the
findings
of
fact
in
this
case.
the
learned
district
judge
sitting
without
a
jury
heard
all
of
the
testimony
in
this
case
and
passed
upon
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
came
to
certain
conclusions
of
fact.
the
most
important
of
which
was
his
ultimate
conclusion
that
the
fees
expended
in
this
patrick
case
were
based
upon
the
testimony
in
the
facts
directly
and
proximately
related
to
the
management
and
conservation
of
income
producing
property.
now,
that
was
the
conclusion
of
fact
which
the
trial
judge
sitting
without
a
jury
reached.
the
case
then
went
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
finding
of
fact
and
that
page
67
of
the
record
sets
out
that
in
view
of
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court
and
the
undisputed
testimony
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer
that
it
found
that
the
$19,200
claimed
as
deductible
were
in
truth
spent
for
the
protection
and
the
conservation
of
income
producing
property
and
that
therefore
these
fees
were
deductible.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
that
they
were
deductible
perhaps
but
that
they
are
directly
and
approximately
related
to
the
production
to
the
conservation
and
management
of
income
producing
property
we
submit
was
a
conclusion
of
fact
based
upon
the
testimony.
if
i
may
pursue
that
point
one
step
further
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
lykes
case
to
which
reference
has
been
made,
quotes
quite
extensively
from
the
house
committee
reports
that
had
to
do
with
this
section
of
the
statute.
and
the
house
committee
report
makes
clear
that
the
only
test
foreseen
by
the
congress
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
expenditures
were
directly
and
proximately
related
to
the
management
and
conservation
of
income
producing
property.
that
committee
report
makes
clear
that
expenditures
for
sports,
hobbies
and
recreations
and
so
on
clearly
are
not
deductible.
but
it
does
say
that
where
they
are
directly
and
proximately
related
to
the
conservation
and
management
of
income
producing
property
that
those
expenses
are
deductible.
that
we
think
was
the
intent
of
the
congress.
now,
in
the
trust
of
bingham,
the
language
is
used
again
there
and
the
point
is
made
that
ordinarily
the
question
of
reasonableness
and
proximity
is
for
the
trier
of
the
facts.
now,
it's
our
position
as
elementary
as
it
seems
that
the
trier
of
the
facts
who
heard
the
testimony,
who
saw
the
witnesses,
who
judged
their
credibility,
who
in
every
way
considered
and
judged
the
facts
in
the
case
concluded
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
expenses
in
this
case
and
this
is
the
patrick
case
were
reasonably
and
proximately
related
to
the
management
and
conservation
of
income
producing
property
and
hence
deductible
under
that
statute.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
m.
ward
they
are
saying
that
the
result
is
wrong.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes
sir.
now,
may
it
please
the
court
in
the
district
court
and
then
the
court
of
appeals,
the
argument
of
the
government
against
the
deduction
of
these
expenditures
by
mr.
patrick
was
based
upon
an
argument
that
these
expenses
were
personal
in
nature.
a
reading
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
would
indicate
that
the
--
what
the
government
was
arguing
in
the
courts
below
was
that
these
expenses
were
personal
in
nature.
now,
the
idea
that
they
might
be
capital
in
nature
was
mentioned
but
so
little
weight
was
given
to
that
argument
that
neither
of
the
opinions
below
mentioned,
they
simply
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
expenses
were
non-business
expenses
and
deductible
and
by
inference
they
say
they
were
not
capital.
but
so
little
emphasis
was
put
on
that
argument
and
neither
the
trial
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
is
not
even
mentioned
in
the
opinions
of
the
courts
below.
now,
the
position
of
the
government
here
before
this
court
is
that
the
expenditures
were
in
the
main
capital
expenditure
and
that
that
is
one
way
in
which
the
government
says
this
case
differs
from
gilmore.
in
the
opinions
of
the
courts
below,
it
can
be
read
that
in
the
arguments
before
the
government
has
taken
the
position
that
the
divorce
was
all
important
and
that
what
these
expenditures
were,
were
expenditures
in
a
divorce
litigation.
now,
the
argument
of
the
government
is
that
the
divorce
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it,
that
the
divorce
is
completely
unimportant.
now,
we
think
that
that
is
not
quite
correct
because
it's
our
view
that
the
court
must
of
course
consider
that
the
activities
of
the
taxpayer
which
is
subject
to
scrutiny
here
did
occur
against
the
background
of
marital
discord
in
a
divorce
action.
there
was
a
divorce
action
in
progress
and
pending.
the
--
as
was
said
in
the
owens
case,
the
divorce
however
furnished
the
occasion
and
not
the
motive
for
the
particular
expenditures
that
we're
discussing
here.
now,
in
this
case,
the
fee
is
charged
by
counsel
were
clearly
allocated
at
the
time
they
were
charged.
when
the
attorneys
had
finished
their
services
they
brought
the
fees
down
with
relation
to
the
services
which
they
had
rendered
and
that
was
agreed
too
by
the
parties.
the
fees
were
allocated
in
this
fashion
of
the
total
of
$24,000.
$4000
clearly
was
charged
or
allocated
to
and
paid
for
the
obtaining
of
the
divorce.
the
divorce
was
for
all
intents
and
purposes
uncontested.
the
$4000
fee
as
acknowledged
by
the
government
involved
the
divorce
and
the
incidents
of
the
divorce
so
that
the
divorce
fee,
the
litigation
fee
for
the
divorce
here
is
completely
set
apart
and
has
been
from
the
beginning
and
was
never
claimed
as
deductible
by
this
taxpayer.
$16,000
of
the
fees
were
charged
for,
allocated
to
and
paid
for.
the
negotiations
of
counsel
which
led
in
the
ultimate,
to
the
agreement
under
which
the
taxpayer
mr.
patrick
was
able
to
transfer
and
to
trade
certain
blue
chip
stocks
of
his
for
a
certain
newspaper
stock
of
his
wife's.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
no
sir,
that
is
clear
in
the
stipulation
in
the
record
and
has
never
been
questioned.
this
allocation
was
made
at
the
time
the
fees
were
incurred
and
it
was
not
an
afterthought.
it
was
not
devised
in
any
way
for
a
tax
benefit
but
that's
the
way
the
fees
were
charged
in
the
beginning
and
there's
never
been
in
question.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
no
sir.
the
$16,000
which
was
allocated
for
the
negotiation
of
the
stock
arrangement
and
that
incidentally
is
clearly
established.
now,
that
was
not
paid
for
the
purchase
of
the
stock
or
by
way
of
a
commission
or
anything
of
that
sort
but
it
was
allocated
to
the
negotiations
involved
in
what
amounted
to
an
ultimate
arrangement.
now,
i'll
go
step
further
on
that
in
a
moment.
but
at
this
point,
what
i
want
to
say,
is
that
the
government
asked
the
court
to
ignore
the
facts
of
life
when
it
suggest
that
because
this
record
reflects
a
final
agreement
between
the
parties,
a
final
harmonious
agreement
at
least
on
its
face.
it
is
wrong
to
suggest
that
this
court
conclude
that
everything
was
amicable
in
this
matter.
it
is
wrong
for
the
court
to
--
it
concluded
at
this
point
that
the
wife
was
quite
happy
to
sell
her
stock
as
the
government
says.
and
that
there
really
was
no
controversy,
no
problem,
no
need
for
negotiation
and
no
need
for
attorneys.
if
that
had
been
the
case,
there
wouldn't
have
been
these
$24,000
worth
of
fees
which
is
a
lot
of
money
down
their
way.
and
would
not
--
they
would
not
have
been
incurred
and
we
would
not
have
been
here.
so
it's
not
correct
for
the
government
to
think
that
or
to
say
that
because
this
problem
was
solved
that
it
was
solved
without
difficulty
or
that
it
could've
been
solved
without
the
careful
service
of
competent
counsel
involved.
now,
then
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do
not
take
for
granted
that
the
court
accepts
my
argument
that
this
is
been
settled
on
question
of
facts
so
i
go
now
in
response
to
the
questions
raised
specifically
by
the
government.
first,
the
allegation
is
that
the
fees
or
the
portion
of
the
fees
allocated
to
the
stock
of
rearrangement
were
capital
in
nature
and
should've
been
added
to
the
base
that
they
became
capital
cost
of
acquisition.
we
say
not
because
to
say
that
they
were
part
of
the
cost
of
acquiring
the
stock,
again
ignores
the
facts
and
the
testimony
in
the
record
which
indicate
that
there
were
long
and
complicated
negotiations
going
on
between
the
parties
which
simply
ultimately
resulted
in
the
acquisition
of
the
stock
in
the
fashion
in
which
it
was
require.
had
the
lawyers
in
this
case
started
out
to
buy
stock
from
mrs.
patrick
or
acquired
from
mrs.
patrick,
again
that
would've
been
too
simple.
there
certainly
wouldn't
have
been
$16,000
of
attorney's
fees
involved
in
that
sort
of
a
transaction.
it's
not
unreasonable.
now,
these
fees
were
not
in
the
nature
of
brokerage
fees
or
commissions.
if
they
had
been,
of
course,
i
think
they
should've
been
added
back
to
base.
that's
pretty
well
settled
but
they
were
not.
the
taxpayer,
mr.
patrick
did
not
acquire
as
the
record
shows
the
full
ownership
of
the
stock,
the
fee
simple
in
the
stock.
he
acquired
only
the
right
to
use
this
28%
of
the
stock
which
is
(inaudible).
he
acquired
the
right
to
use
it
during
his
lifetime,
he
could
never
sell
it.
if
he
died
owning
it,
it
pass
to
his
children.
if
during
the
course
of
his
lifetime,
there
were
to
be
a
sale
of
the
total
assets
of
this
corporation
which
the
stock
represented
then
under
the
agreement
he
must
first
give
the
stock
to
his
children
who
then
would
affect
the
sale
and
realize
any
benefits
from
the
sale,
all
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale.
now,
that
doesn't
suggest
on
its
face
that
these
fees
were
an
incident
of
the
capital
cost
of
acquisition,
the
nature
of
the
right
that
he
occurred
although
it
might
be
capital.
the
nature
of
it
doesn't
suggest
that
the
fees
involved
in
acquiring
an
agreement
under
which
he
could
get
this
limited
use
of
the
stock
were
capital
and
should
be
added
back
to
base.
incidentally,
under
this
arrangement
by
which
he
acquired
the
stock
there
is
no
apparent
tax
benefit
to
him
and
that
in
adding
--
if
it
were
added
back
to
base
because
he
can
never
sell
the
stock
and
it
already
belongs
to
his
children
simply
subject
to
--
excuse
me,
his
life
estate
or
he's
giving
it
to
them
to
sell.
they
could
never
incur
any
tax
benefit
of
any
sort
because
they
would
take
it
at
the
value
at
which
he
gave
it
to
them.
the
fees
we
say
were
for
the
negotiations
and
not
a
capital
cost
of
acquisition
and
one
of
the
best
reasons
or
one
of
the
best
points
we
think
in
making
that
clear
that
these
are
not
in
the
nature
of
commissions
or
brokerage
fees
is
that
it
is
obvious
to
us
all
from
the
record
that
had
mr.
patrick
not
been
able
to
secure
agreement
for
this
trade
or
stock,
had
he
not
been
able
to
secure
the
use
of
the
stock,
he
still
would've
owed
the
attorney's
fees.
now,
i
can't
say
--
mr.
robert
m.
ward
he
still
would
have
owed
these
attorney's
fees.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
they
still
would've
been
due
to
counsel
because
the
record
shows
that
they
were
expanded
for
a
long
period
of
no
--
negotiations
which
simply
ultimately
resulted
in
it
--
in
a
stock
trade.
now,
is
that
an
incident
of
capital
cost
of
acquisition?
that,
if
a
man
buys
a
stock
and
he
encourage
brokerage
fees
or
commissions,
he
encourage
them
only
if
he
acquires
the
item
that
he's
buying.
this
point
alone
we
think
makes
clear
that
the
fees
were
not
capital
because
he
would've
owed
the
fees
regardless
of
whether
he
got
the
stock.
i
can't
say
--
mr.
robert
m.
ward
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
i
was
hastening
to
say
that
i
can't
say
that
they
would've
been
in
the
amount
of
$16,000
because
presumably
there
would
--
might
have
been
some
slight
fee
for
actually
drafting
the
papers
of
transfer,
there
might
have
been
some
fee
added
for
the
result
accomplished
which
was
pleasant
to
the
taxpayer,
something
of
that
sort.
but
certainly
the
bulk
of
the
fees
under
the
testimony
had
been
earned
by
counsel
and
would
have
been
due
by
the
taxpayer
of
whether
he
acquired
this
property
or
not.
that
being
in
the
case,
we
say
that's
the
best
argument,
they
could
not
be
capital
in
nature.
now,
the
government
wants
this
court
to
attempt
to
change
the
allocation
of
these
fees.
the
(inaudible)
--
the
first
element
of
fees
was
the
$4000
for
the
divorce,
the
second
element
was
the
$16,000
for
the
stock
matters.
then
there
is
an
item
of
$3200
which
was
charged
for
allocated
to
and
paid
by
the
taxpayer
for
the
total
effort
on
the
part
of
counsel
in
negotiating
and
understanding
under
which
this
real
property
which
was
occupied
by
the
physical
plan
of
this
newspaper
under
which
that
real
property
was
conveyed
into
a
trust
and
a
long
term
lease
assured
to
the
newspaper.
now,
the
taxpayer
owned
4/5ths
of
that
building,
that
property,
the
taxpayer's
wife
owned
1/5th.
they
were
tenants
in
common
and
they
owned
undivided
interest
in
this
building.
in
addition
to
which
the
wife
had
a
dower
in
his
portion
of
the
property.
now,
as
an
incident
of
management
and
as
an
incident
of
conserving
property
if
you
please,
the
parties
conveyed
their
undivided
interest
in
this
real
property
into
a
trust
which
had
several
effects.
it
guaranteed
that
there
would
be
no
division
of
the
property.
as
tenants
in
common
of
course
the
property
could've
been
partitioned
and
sold
and
divided.
could've
been
sold
out
from
under
the
newspaper,
could've
been
acquired
by
someone
else.
but
it
had
the
effect
of
assuring
that
there
would
be
no
division
of
the
property.
it
had
the
effect
which
we
think
is
significant
of
assuring
an
income
to
the
wife
and
the
children
of
the
taxpayer
and
in
assuring
an
income
to
the
wife
from
this
she
got
no
more
--
perhaps
she
got
less
than
she
already
had
by
way
of
her
fifth
interest
and
her
dollar
interest.
so,
he
was
doing
those
things
at
the
same
time
because
mr.
patrick's
life
interest
was
this
newspaper.
he
was
assuring
that
his
newspaper
could
continue
to
occupy
this
building
which
he
no
longer
owned
80%
of
and
that
it
would
ensure
a
long-term
lease
and
his
long-term
occupancy
of
the
building.
now,
the
$3200
was
paid
for
the
total
effort
of
counsel
in
obtaining
those
results.
the
government
says
you
should
reallocate
and
break
that
down
and
you
should
take
some
portion
of
the
fees
and
some
unknown
amount
and
allocate
them
to
the
corporation
for
any
benefit
it
acquired
by
the
long-term
lease
that
you
should
allocate
some
unknown
sum
to
the
--
to
mr.
--
to
the
trust,
to
mr.
and
mrs.
patrick
for
any
benefit
that
they
may
have
required
in
getting
the
lease
from
the
newspaper.
and
that
you
should
then
treat
some
of
the
--
and
that
those
matters
should
be
amortized,
this
capital
additions
to
base
and
that
you
should
take
some
other
unknown
quantity
and
regard
that
as
a
purely
personal
expenditure
by
the
taxpayer
in
connection
with
the
setting
up
of
this
trust.
we
don't
see
it
that
way,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
see
every
aspect
of
this
fee
as
it
was
allocated
and
paid
as
being
incidents
of
management
and
we
submit
management
is
a
broad
word.
incidents
of
management,
incidents
of
conserving
of
real
property,
of
conserving
of
income
producing
property,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
of
those
results
indicated
that
and
that
alone.
now,
the
trial
court
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
those
facts
to
be
correct
and
came
up
with
the
result
we
mentioned.
i
hasten
now
to
two
other
points.
one,
that
the
government
suggest
in
its
point
3
that
in
the
alternative,
that
in
the
alternative
if
there
is
any
part
of
these
fees
which
are
not
capital
and
not
personal
under
some
other
theory
that
they
are
personal
as
being
the
time
that
--
as
being
fees
used
for
the
resisting
of
liability.
i
think
that
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth
that
there
was
no
resistance
of
liability
at
any
point
that
the
taxpayer
never
resisted
liability.
he
never
resisted
the
assertion
of
her
right.
he
did
one
thing.
he
employed
counsel
to
determine
how
he
could
meet
reasonable
and
proper
claims
and
still
not
drastically
affect
his
financial
structure,
his
income
producing
property.
still
retain
control
of
the
newspaper
publication
which
was
his
life
work
and
which
he
has
retained
by
reason
of
the
marital
relationship.
he
expended
these
fees
to
retain
occupancy
of
the
building
and
none
of
those
things,
may
it
please
the
court,
appeared
to
me
to
be
personal
in
nature
or
to
be
anything
other
than
business
or
as
this
section
says,
non-business
expenses.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes
sir,
it
was
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
and
that
--
that
we
think
are
--
who
doesn't
make
these
fees
personal
because
the
personal
element
was
taken
cared
off
in
the
payment
of
the
$4000
which
covered
all
of
the
incidents
of
the
divorce.
it
just
happened
that
this
was
the
occasion
and
not
the
motive
for
the
expenditures.
now,
as
to
the
point
raised
by
the
government
with
respect
to
the
wife's
attorney's
fees,
we
say
again
that
the
government
asked
for
a
new
allocation.
they
want
to
take
the
allocation
made
by
counsel
and
approved
by
the
courts
below
and
make
a
new
one,
as
this
court
to
make
a
new
one.
this
taxpayer
contracted
and
agreed
with
his
wife
to
pay
all
attorneys'
fees.
he
entered
into
that
contract
and
agreement
because
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
do
that
in
order
to
obtain
the
agreement.
it
was
a
part
of
the
cost,
the
expense
to
him
of
obtaining
the
agreement,
not
of
acquiring
property
or
disposing
the
property
but
its
part
of
the
--
or
what
he
had
to
pay
in
order
to
get
the
agreement
that
he
paid
these
fees
and
he
contracted
to
pay
them
all
and
agreed.
and
the
trial
court
in
south
carolina
ordered
him
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
that
contract
and
to
pay
all
of
these
fees
which
he
did.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
well,
i'm
using
that
in
the
term
that
they're
asking
that
the
$16,000
and
the
$3200
be
broken
down
and
divided
as
between
his
fees
and
the
wife's
fees.
but
the
government
is
taking
the
position
are
not
deductible.
we
say
that
that
he
had
an
obligation
to
pay
them
that
they
were
his
fees.
now,
the
owens
case
which
is
mentioned
in
this
record
i
think
is
bad
law.
there
were
unique
circumstances
there
and
you'd
think
there'd
never
be
another
case
like
it.
but
there
is
in
this
case,
uniquely
in
element
of
that
nature
because
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
very
able
counsel
in
this
case,
mr.
lumpkin
indicates
that
the
attorney
has
had
a
joint
pain
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
sir?
mr.
robert
m.
ward
well,
they
represented
the
parties
their
separate
parties
and
i
--
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes
sir.
and
i
certainly
say
there
was
no
impropriety
in
the
fact
that
the
testimony
mr.
lumpkin
indicates
that
they
had
to
join
forces
and
if
they
had
to
work
things
out
which
accomplished
in
the
ultimate
if
it's
reviewed
carefully,
matters
which
were
definitely
in
this
taxpayer's
interest.
now,
they
wanted
--
they
did
it
in
a
way
that
was
acceptable
to
the
wife.
mr.
robert
m.
ward
yes
sir.
now,
in
the
davis
case
which
was
scheduled
with
this
in
march
and
has
since
been
decided
by
this
court,
there
apparently
was
no
question
that
the
attorney's
fees
went
to
a
tax
consultant
who
considered
only
her
tax
interest
and
her
tax
benefits
and
so
on.
a
reading
of
this
case
will
indicate
that
these
benefits
in
your
--
to
this
taxpayer
and
that
he
paid
the
fees
under
his
contract
to
pay.
thank
you.
