mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
did
also
involve
the
deductibility
of
legal
fees
incident,
at
least
coincidentally
to
a
divorce.
now
the
reason
i
say
coincidentally
is
we
do
not
deny
that
husbands
and
wives
may
have
business
relationships
between
themselves
or
other
relationships
between
themselves
than
marital
rights.
our
position
about
what
is
personal
is
that
the
defense
of
a
claim
based
upon
marriage
rights
arising
out
of
marriage
is
personal.
this
case
i
don't
think
really
involves
that
question.
i
think
this
case
involves
simply
a
rearrangement
of
independent
property
interest
separately
owned
by
the
husband
and
wife
and
to
that
extent
it's
quite
different
from
the
gilmore
case.
the
marriage
here
was
--
had
lasted
about
for
number
of
years
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no,
no,
the
reno
divorce
situation
as
i
understood
your
question,
the
claim
that
was
settled
in
the
settlement
was
the
wife's
claim
to
alimony
or
to
a
property
settlement
and
that
is
the
gilmore
case.
that's
the
gilmore
case.
she
is
asserting
marital
rights
that
set
the
settlement
of
marital
rights
and
obligations
and
those
are
personal
rights
and
obligations
in
the
expense
of
dealing
with
them
are
personal
expenses.
this
case,
as
i
will
show,
involves
the
wife's
separate
ownership
of
some
stock
in
the
corporation
and
basically
a
purchase
that
stock
by
the
husband.
there
were
three
children
of
the
marriage.
at
the
time
of
the
divorce,
one
of
them
was
of
age
and
two
were
approaching
their
majority.
the
divorce
seems
to
have
been
caused
by
so-called
other
woman
who
has
anticipated
the
husband
was
--
was
going
to
and
he
did
in
fact
marry
after
the
divorce.
the
wife
tame
â€“
claimed
the
divorce
on
grounds
of
adultery.
the
husband
didn't
defend.
his
answer
neither
admitted
nor
denied
charges
that
were
approved
by
the
wife
by
an
admission
made
by
him.
before
the
divorce
was
entered,
they
had
settled
their
property
affairs.
this
case
is
about
the
fees
incurred
in
settling
the
property
affairs,
not
the
fees
of
getting
the
divorce
as
such,
the
property
of
which
they
own
at
the
time
of
the
divorce.
mr.
patrick
was
president
and
editor
--
he
was
president
of
the
herald
publishing
company
and
the
editor
of
the
newspaper
which
it
published.
he
also
owned
28%
of
the
stock
of
the
company.
his
wife
owned
independently
another
28%.
the
adult
son
owned
9%
in
his
own
right.
the
rest
of
the
stock
was
in
trust
for
the
minor
children
and
some
also
for
the
adult
child.
the
trustees
of
the
trust
were
the
husband
and
wife,
so
the
voting
control
of
the
corporation
turned
upon
the
ownership
of
the
husband,
the
wife
and
the
adult
son.
now,
the
wife's
stock
had
been
acquired
by
dissent
from
her
father
and
as
--
has
have
the
stock
owned
by
the
children.
they
didn't
come
from
--
from
mr.
patrick
at
all.
it
doesn't
appear
where
mr.
patrick
got
his
stock
but
one
supposes
that
he
had
gotten
it
from
his
father-in-law
at
some
time
or
other.
in
addition
to
their
ownership
of
stock,
the
husband
and
wife
jointly
owned
or
owned
in
common
the
real
estate
that
housed
the
newspaper
building.
he
had
a
fourth
--
four
fifths
undivided
interest
and
she
had
a
one-fifth
undivided
interest
and
they
leased
the
building
to
the
newspaper
company.
now,
these
properties
were
the
only
properties
--
i'm
sorry,
were
the
only
properties
other
than
two
houses,
they
jointly
owned
two
houses,
these
were
the
only
properties
involved
in
--
in
the
negotiations.
however,
each
of
the
parties
in
fact
also
had
a
substantial
amount
of
other
assets
independently
owned,
consisting
of
various
stocks
and
bonds.
mr.
patrick's
salary
as
--
as
editor
was
$15,000.
his
dividends
from
the
publishing
company
were
worth
$4,000.
his
share
of
the
gross
rentals
$15,000
and
the
building
couldn't
have
come
to
more
than
$6,000
which
would
have
produced
a
total
income
of
about
$25,000,
but
his
total
income
reported
was
in
fact
$55,000.
he
had
$30,000
from
other
sources.
it
also
appears
that
the
wife
was
independently
well
to
do
although
the
size
of
their
estate
does
not
appear.
now,
the
nature
of
the
negotiation
was
an
unscrambling
of
this
interrelated
interest
of
theirs
in
the
newspaper
business.
we
have
in
the
record
depositions
by
the
attorneys
for
each
side
who
represented
the
parties
in
the
negotiations
and
an
explanation
of
what
they
were
trying
to
do
and
why,
what
purposes
they
had
sought
to
achieve
and
there
is
no
conflict
about
that.
mrs.
gilmore
--
mrs.
patrick
was
happy
to
have
mr.
patrick
to
continue
as
editor
of
the
newspaper.
he
had
greatly
increased
the
circulation
during
the
eight
years
that
he
had
been
the
editor.
mr.
patrick
wanted
to
continue,
but
he
was
advised
by
his
attorney
that
although
there
was
not
present
disagreement
between
the
parties,
he
thought
it
unwise
for
mr.
patrick
in
view
of
the
uncertain
state
of
the
future
relationships
to
be
subject
to
the
risk
of
being
out
voted
by
the
wife
worth
28%
and
the
eldest
son
who
seem
to
be
siding
with
the
wife
and
so
he
advised
mr.
patrick
that
he
ought
to
try
to
buy
mrs.
patrick's
stock.
mrs.
patrick
recognized
that
she
couldn't
expect
him
to
stay
on
certainly
to
that
--
for
that
trap
and
she
was
quite
willing
to
sell
him
the
stock
for
its
fair
value.
her
one
concern
she
say
--
he
said
--
her
attorney
was
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
children
and
the
newspaper
ultimately
going
to
them.
two
of
the
children
were
already
interested
in
journalism
where
one
was
already
a
newspaperman
and
the
other
was
studying
journalism
in
the
family
tradition
and
she
wanted
to
be
sure
that
the
property
would
ultimately
go
to
the
children
rather
than
to
this
new
wife
that
he
was
going
to
acquire.
mr.
patrick
equally
wanted
to
care
for
the
children
and
he
was
quite
happy,
he
planned
to
give
the
stock
to
the
children
anyway
and
he
was
quite
happy
to
commit
himself
to
give
the
stock
and
the
real
property
to
the
children.
that's
what
the
negotiations
were
about
and
the
agreement
that
was
finally
arrived
at
was
simply
this
that
mr.
patrick
would
convey
mrs.
patrick's
blue
chip
securities
of
a
value
equal
to
the
value
of
her
shares
of
stock
in
the
company.
she
would
transfer
the
stock
to
him
subject
to
the
condition
that
upon
his
death
or
if
they
should
earlier
decide
to
sell
the
whole
business,
he
would
pass
to
the
children
in
equal
shares,
similarly
the
real
property.
the
--
the
result
was
that
the
real
property
was
put
in
to
--
they
first
renegotiated
the
long-term
lease
with
the
newspaper
corporation.
and
they
put
the
real
property
in
a
trust
to
pay
the
income
to
the
wife
for
life
and
the
properties
then
to
go
in
equal
shares
to
the
children.
now,
it's
our
view
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
since
the
divorce
is
obtained
on
the
grounds
of
adultery,
she
would
have
been
entitled
under
south
carolina
law
to
a
substantial
share
of
his
property
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
and
of
alimony.
however,
there's
a
bit
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse
because
the
agreement
was
arrived
at
before
he
filed
his
answer
in
which
he
did
not
--
he
did
not
deny
adultery.
she
proved
adultery
by
his
admission.
now,
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
imply
anything
improper,
but
had
the
agreement
fall
in
through,
the
divorce
contest
might
have
taken
a
very
different
action,
it
might
have
taken
a
very
different
course.
he
might
have
contested
and
it
maybe
that
she
could
not
have
proved
that
--
the
adultery,
but
i
dare
say
that
there
was
in
existence,
a
--
a
potential
right
of
the
wife
to
demand
a
share
of
his
property.
the
fact
is
that
her
attorney
explained
she
didn't
want
anything
for
herself.
my
impression
is
she
had
more
than
he
had.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
that
she
was
concerned
only
to
see
the
property
ultimately
go
to
the
children
in
case
his
attitude
towards
them
will
change
after
he
married
the
other
woman.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
agreement
--
the
agreement
was
in
satisfaction
of
all
rights
and
the
--
she
released
all
claims
by
the
agreement
which
was
entered
into
before
the
divorce.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
--
no,
i
don't
know.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
before
the
answer
was
filed
and
before
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
decision.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
his
property?
not
--
not
without
setting
aside
the
agreement
of
the
parties.
now,
i
don't
know
what
the
powers
of
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
when
she
filed
the
divorce
action
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood.
no
at
--
when
she
filed
the
divorce
action,
her
claims,
if
sustained,
would
have
entitled
her
to
a
share
of
his
profit.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
now,
but
it
--
that
element
is
there.
the
sympathetic
element
is
there,
we
say
it's
a
purely
personal
claim,
but
actually,
i
--
i
--
i
don't
think
the
reason
that
these
expenses
are
nondeductible
is
primarily
that
they're
personal
--
but
primarily
that
they're
capital.
it's
a
purchase
of
stock
by
a
minority
stockholder
who
has
falling
out
with
the
majority
stockholder
and
obviously
his
position
as
an
officer
of
the
corporation
has
jeopardized
any
minority
stockholder
--
stockholding
officer
holds
his
office
at
the
pleasure
of
majority
stockholder
and
if
the
relationships
become
strained,
it's
to
his
advantage
to
buy
up
a
majority
interest
and
that
really
is
what
the
transaction
here
was
about
and
the
cost
of
minority
stockholder
acquiring
the
majority
interest
in
order
to
protect
his
position
as
president
of
the
corporation
is
a
capital
cost.
it's
like
the
cost
of
acquiring
any
stock.
now,
i
would
like
to
separate
several
of
the
other
elements
of
the
negotiations
of
the
agreement
to
determine
the
characterization
of
the
various
elements
that
went
into
it.
the
cost
allocable
to
negotiating
the
provision
for
his
payment
of
support
for
the
two
minor
children,
it's
one
of
the
provisions,
is
obviously
personal
we
would
say.
the
cost
of
negotiating
his
purchase
of
her
stock,
we
would
say
is
capital
to
the
extent
that
you
allocate
separately
something
to
the
negotiation
about
the
remainder
provision
going
to
the
children,
the
condition
that
go
to
the
children,
there
might
be
a
personal
element
in
that
since
they're
working
out
a
mutual
object
to
provide
for
a
devolution
to
the
natural
objects
of
their
bounty,
but
primarily,
that
element
is
capital.
the
negotiation
of
the
lease,
the
new
lease
between
the
owners
of
the
property
and
the
corporation,
the
expenses
of
negotiating
a
long-term
lease
are
capital
expenses,
they
must
be
capitalized
and
amortized
over
the
period
of
the
lease.
they're
not
currently
deductible
expenses
that's
--
as
to
the
owners.
as
to
the
corporation
who
by
the
way
was
in
some
way
represented
in
--
in
these
negotiations
in
making
this
new
lease,
the
expenses
were
not
only
capital,
but
they
were
expenses
of
the
corporation
and
not
of
mr.
patrick.
a
stockholder's
business
and
a
corporation's
business
are
very
different
things
and
if
he
paid
any
fees
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
executing
the
lease
that
was
simply
a
contribution
to
capital.
the
--
if
any
fees
allocable
to
creating
a
trust
for
the
real
estate
with
life
estate
to
the
wife
and
remainder
to
the
children,
i
would
say
are
entirely
personal
to
the
extent
that
the
wife's
life
estate
was
worth
more
than
the
20%
fee
interest
that
she
previously
had.
there
was
a
net
transfer
to
her.
the
values
don't
appear
so
i
can't
say
that
there
wasn't
much.
she
owned
20%
of
the
real
estate
to
begin
with
and
she
gave
up
her
20%
for
a
life
estate
in
the
whole.
so
there
may
have
been
a
--
a
net
gain
to
her
there
so
that's
the
only
thing
she
got
out
of
the
agreement
and
--
and
for
all
that
--
that's
all
she
ever
asked
for.
but
to
the
extent
that
she
got
something
there
and
may
have
been
recognition
of
the
marital
right
which
we
would
say
is
personal
and
to
the
extent
that
this
is
created
in
order
to
sure
devolution
to
the
children,
we
would
say
that's
personal
in
--
in
the
sense
of
estate
planning.
basically,
what
this
was
that
buy
out
by
the
husband
of
his
wife's
stock
interest
but
the
wife
insisting
upon
some
advance
estate
planning
to
protect
the
children
to
make
sure
that
they
got
something.
i
don't
think
an
assertion
of
marital
rights,
the
rights
to
alimony,
the
rights
to
a
--
some
of
his
property
by
virtue
of
marriage
relationship
were
really
involved.
now,
i
say
that
not
because
i
--
i
--i'm
concerned
that
they
were,
i
think
that's
make
it
even
more
personal
if
they
were,
i
think
the
main
reason
they're
not
deductible
because
they
were
capital.
now
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes,
yes.
gilmore
--
well,
le
--
let's
--
let
me
give
you
the
--
the
owens
case
in
the
fifth
circuit.
there
the
wife
admitted,
there
was
a
lumber
business
which
admittedly
was
owned
in
community
property
and
would
be
divided
50-50,
there
was
no
question
of
as
in
california
of
equitable
division
community
property,
it
was
her
50%
of
the
property.
and
in
that
case,
the
husband
wanted
to
keep
the
lumber
business
and
ultimately
arrived
in
agreement
with
the
wife
that
he
would
get
the
lumber
business,
she
would
get
the
property
out
of
the
lake
and
the
residence
and
a
$100,000
in
cash
and
some
other
property,
apparently,
it
was
all
community
property
and
all
50-50
ownership.
now
that
case
involving
community
property
i
think
is
like
patrick.
that
is
a
simply
a
transfer
of
capital
interest
admittedly
independently
owned
by
the
two
parties.
it's
a
ca
--
the
reason
it's
not
allowed
as
deductions
because
it's
a
capital
expense,
not
because
it's
personal.
husbands
and
wives
can
have
independent
property
interest
and
they
can
negotiate
about
them
and
that's
not
personal.
what
is
personal
is
an
assertion
of
marital
rights,
the
assertion
that
you're
entitled
to
alimony
because
of
the
marriage.
you're
entitled
to
share
of
his
property
because
of
the
marriage
that
because
of
the
marriage
you
--
you
have
a
claim
to
community
property
as
in
gilmore.
now
gilmore,
we
don't
have
admitted
community
property.
all
the
disputes
about
--
was
about
--
was
whether
there
was
community
property.
she
asserted
a
claim
to
a
part
of
the
property
arriving
from
her
status
as
his
wife
during
the
period
that
it
appreciated
in
value.
that,
i
--
i
--
i
would
say,
i
would
put
with
the
rights
in
the
common
law
state
of
the
wife
somewhat
differently
defined,
but
not
ultimately
really
different
in
--
in
substance
particularly
in
california
where
they
divide
up
the
community
property
according
to
the
equities.
i
will
put
that
with
the
rights
in
the
community
property
estate
to
a
proper
a
share
of
the
--
a
fair
share
of
the
husband's
property
or
to
alimony.
these
are
rights
deriving
from
the
relationship
and
solely
from
the
relationship
of
a
husband
and
wife.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
dissolution
of
a
law
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
of
law
partnership,
it's
clearly
not
personal.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
personal.
this
arises
from
a
business
transaction.
the
question
there
would
be
capital
or
current.
i
would
think
many
of
the
expenses
would
probably
be
--
be
currently
deductible.
that's
rather
like
the
--
being
in
a
trust
case,
it's
the
part
of
--
in
going
into
a
business
transaction
or
partnership
or
creating
a
trust
and
carrying
it
out
is
that
one
day,
you've
got
to
wind
it
up
and
--
and
give
things
back
and
pay
out
the
income.
and,
i
think
generally
to
that
extent,
those
are
current
rather
than
capitalized
expenses,
but
actually,
our
problem
here,
i
think,
is
quite
different
in
character
from
that.
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
that
derives
--
that
--
that
derives
from
the
prior
conduct
of
a
trade
or
business.
now,
if
in
the
partnership
case,
the
partners
negotiated
about
one
of
them
buying
out
the
other
that
would
be
capital.
i
was
speaking
of
a
case,
that
simply
--
probably
a
dissolution
just
the
expenses
of
--
of
the
effect
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
(voice
overlap)
send
the
papers
in.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no,
i
--
those
are
generally
capital.
i
mean
buying
out
one
partner
--
one
partner
buying
out
another
partner's
interest
as
opposed
to
--
to
dis
--
distribution
and
dissolution.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
actually,
i
think
--
let
me
say
it.
i
think
there
is
considerable
litigation
on
that
issue
and
i
--
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
solve
this
case
by
that
one.
i
think
that's
a
much
more
different
case
from
this
one.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
can
i
ask
you
to
distinguish
the
case
of
the
--
the
minority
stockholder
was
the
president
of
the
corporation.
his
tenure
as
president
of
the
corporation
depends
upon
the
goodwill
of
the
majority
stockholder
and
he
approaches
the
majority
stockholder
and
offers
to
buy
the
majority
stockholders'
stock
to
nail
down
his
position
as
president.
that's
this
case.
this
isn't
business
asset.
these
are
stock
interest
in
a
corporation.
now,
you
may
get
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
think
that's
all
i
have.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
he
didn't
have
community.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
or
third
or
half.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
none
at
all.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
the
reason
--
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes,
i
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
only
reason
he
did
it
was
to
save
his
property,
the
only
reason
he
paid
the
fees.
the
reason
is
that
a
claim
has
two
relevant
aspects,
arguably
relevant
aspects
and
one
is
the
source
of
the
claim.
the
other
is
the
effect
of
having
to
satisfy
it.
now,
all
claims
in
the
world,
the
effect
of
having
to
satisfy
them
is
to
diminish
your
income-producing
property
unless
you
happen
not
to
have
your
property
in
that
form.
all
claims
are
threats
upon
income-producing
property,
tort
claims,
slander
suits,
paternity
suits.
every
claim
in
the
world
is
a
threat
upon
your
property.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
a
criminal
case,
yes.
i
--
that
is
to
say,
it
seems
to
me,
that
everything
is
deductible.
every
time
you
negotiate
a
lower
price
to
buy
a
house,
you're
conserving
your
income-producing
property
because
you're
conserving
your
assets.
you
--
you
pay
less
with
the
house,
you
--
you've
conserved
assets
which
you
can
produce
income.
it
can't
simply
be
that
the
consequential
effect
of
the
claim
upon
what
you
own.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
--
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
let
--
well
--
that
--
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
you
--
i
--
can
approach
these
in
two
ways.
one
is
--
it
is
to
say
that
conserving
doesn't
mean
keeping
from
others.
it
means
the
--
the
--
the
necessary
conservation
of
the
property
in
kind,
the
maintenance
expense,
the
safe
deposit
box,
that's
what
you
mean
by
conserving.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
management.
now,
i
don't
think
that's
--
let
me
say
i
--
i
don't
think
these
problems
can
be
solved
by
parsing
statutory
language.
section
22
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
is
the
broad
general
provision
about
business
expenses.
you
--
you
cannot
articulate
in
language
of
the
precise
lines.
this
code
really
leaves
it
to
judicial
evolution
case
by
case
process.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
i
doubt
that
the
ordinary
congressman
would
think
conservation
of
income-producing
property
defending
tort
suits.
i
don't
think
he
would
think
it
meant
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
on
any
kind
of
claims?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
alright.
let
--
let
me
approach
--
approach
one
of
the
ways
first
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
statute
also
expressly
disallows
personal
expenses.
now
these
are
of
equal
dignity,
the
allowance
of
business
and
the
disallowance
of
personal.
alright,
so
if
you
say
that
the
effect
of
it
on
income-producing
property
makes
it
a
business
expense,
what
about
the
case
where
it's
a
business
claim
and
it
threatens
personal
property,
it
threatens
your
--
your
ancestral
home,
it
threatens
your
life
insurance
policies,
your
jewelries
--
your
jewelry,
your
art
treasures.
what
he
is
doing
is
defending
personal
property
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
and
therefore
it's
personal.
i
(voice
overlap)
would
have
to
say.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
might
say
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
mr.
justice
jackson
in
his
dissent
in
lykes
which,
i
think
you
joined
--
almost
suggested
that
would
be
deductible.
i
hope
i
persuaded
you
otherwise
today.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it's
just
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
think
--
all
i
can
say
is
i
don't
find
management
conservation
and,
what's
the
other
word,
of
income
maintenance
of
income-producing
property.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
legislative
history,
which
--
before
--
the
only
reason
23
(a)
(2)
is
there
is
that
prior
decisions
culminating
higgins,
holding
that
a
lot
of
income-producing
activities
what
corp
--
admitted
were
business
transactions
didn't
qualify
under
the
technical
notion
of
what
is
a
trade
or
business.
a
trade
or
business
was
some
--
i
--
i've
never
quite
understood
the
concept.
there
was
some
sort
of
a
special
kind
of
occupational
endeavor.
higgins
which
the
legislative
history
specifically
talks
about
was
a
case
of
a
man
who
has
vast
investments
in
stocks
and
bonds.
he
staffed
in
office
to
manage
them,
secretarial
help,
telephone
bills
and
negotiating,
placing
orders,
etcetera.
the
court
held
that
that
was
not
a
trade
or
business.
admittedly,
it
was
solely
to
produce
income
by
managing
his
income-producing
property.
it
was
that
the
property
of
23
(a)
(2).
all
that
23
(a)
(2)
does
in
the
legislative
history,
which
--
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
and
it's
not
quoted
in
the
lykes
case
and
in
mcdonnell,
i
think
a
pro
--
and
for
this
purpose.
it
makes
clear
that
the
only
purpose
was
to
broaden
the
kind
of
activity
that's
treated
as
a
business
activity.
holding
and
managing
stocks
is
an
income-producing
or
business
activity
and
the
expenses
attributable
to
it,
the
safe
deposit
box,
accounts
of
fees,
the
investment
accounts
of
fees
et
cetera.
but
(voice

mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
this
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
actually,
as
i
suggested
yesterday,
i
don't
think
there's
any
difference
between
the
two
sections
in
this
case
because
both
courts
rely
heavily
upon
the
threat
to
his
job
and
his
job
isn't
income-producing
property.
his
job
is
a
business.
the
job
of
being
a
president
and
editor
of
a
cor
--
of
a
newspaper
is
a
--
a
trade
or
business
since
that
really,
under
23
(a)
(1)
not
(2)
and
the
proper
language
is
this
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business,
was
his
buying
the
stock
to
keep
his
job
a
part
of
carrying
on
his
trade
or
business
of
being
the
president.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
they
agreed
upon
the
value.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
value
of
the
stock
was
$112,000,
the
agreed
upon
value.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
real
estate,
all
we
know
about
is
the
new
lease
that
was
negotiated
for
$15,000
a
year,
gross
rent.
and
i
--
as
i
remember,
i've
been
told
that
gross
(voice

--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
is
about
10%
of
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
of
the
(voice

mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
it
--
he
owned
80%
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
stocks
worth
$112,000.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
he
--
he
gave
her.
that
wasn't
--
that
wasn't
the
exchange.
for
her
stock,
he
gave
her
blue
chips
stock
and
securities
that
he
independently
owned
otherwise.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
he
purchased
those.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
her
20%.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
to
the
children.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
relationships
you're
trying
to
draw.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
all
--
all
based
on
the
$15,000
annual
rental
which
i
think
is
i
would
know.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
what
the
heading
says.
i
think
all
it
does
is
to
distinguish
it
from
23
(a)
(1)
which
is
--
has
always
been
called
trade
or
business
expenses.
this
is
not
a
trade
or
business.
i
use
business
in
the
sense
of
all
income-producing
activities
because
i
say
the
business
--
what
he
was
protecting
here
was
the
job
and
his
job
is
a
trade
or
business.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there's
no
better
way
to
manage
our
treasures
than
to
keep
people
from
taking
them
from
you
and
everyone
defends
his
property
or
defends
money.
you
don't
like
to
pay
out
money
and
that
--
it
happens
to
be
--
that
your
money
happens
to
be
invested
in
income-producing
property
rather
than
non-income-producing
property.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
why
you
defend
a
lawsuit
when
your
wife
is
asking
for
$300,000.
$300,000
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
a
tort
plaintiff
equally
depends
for
the
same
reasons.
our
--
our
position
is
that
it
depends
upon
this
--
the
nature
of
the
claim.
if
the
claim
that's
asserted,
arose
out
of
the
business,
for
example
a
suit
by
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
out
of
the
business
transaction.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
out
of
the
property
income.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
the
gist
i
was
going
to
give
is
that
of
a
tort
suit
for
injuries
caused
by
your
employee
while
on
--
while
on
business.
if
that
source
of
this
--
the
claim,
defending
it
is
a
business
expense
even
though
all
you
have
in
the
world
is
--
is
non-business
assets
at
the
time
you're
sued.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
it
is
clearly
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
that
is
allowable.
i
think
--
i
think
kornhauser
the
--
in
--
way
back
in
278
u.s.
established
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
clearly
allowable,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it's
equally
clear,
we
think,
that
if
the
injury
was
caused
while
you're
driving
for
pleasure,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
business.
it's
not
a
business
expense.
thank
you.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
was
not
aware
that
i
had
time
left,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
thank
you.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
might
give
you
a
--
--
a
brief
history
where
this
litigation
came
from.
back
in
1926,
the
tax
court
had
this
question,
a
divorce
suit.
there,
the
man
claimed
that
his
main
property
was
stocks
and
bonds
and
corporations
which
has
officers
and
directors.
this
is
the
joyce
case
cited
in
our
--
our
brief.
the
tax
court,
assuming
that
that
was
a
trade
or
business,
they
didn't
decide
it
on
that
ground,
rejected
his
claim
that
--
that
he
was
defending
his
business
property
against
his
wife's
claims
out
of
hand
and
said,
this
is
nonsense.
the
fact
that
this
is
going
to
impinge
upon
your
income-producing
property,
your
business
property
has
not
been
determined
and
it's
the
source
but
the
nature
of
the
claim
then
asserted
this.
that
was
1926.
the
law
stood
static
in
that's
--
in
that
position
until
1952,
26
years
later
when
the
eight
circuit
in
the
baer
case
announced
its
decision
and
everything
has
followed
from
baer.
most
of
these
cases
tried
to
bring
it
under
that
notion
and
i
would
ask
the
court
simply
to
read
the
baer
case
and
compare
a
conflicting
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
lewis
case
and
i
--
i
think
they
will
stand
on
their
own
feet.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
has
been
--
i
haven't
traced
back
the
regulation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
so
far
as
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
so
far
as
i
know,
i
know
for
all
time,
our
position
--
mr.
wayne

barnett
that
our
position
has
always
been

mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
have
no
exception
to
that.
mr.
wayne

barnett
yes
sir.
mr.

as
to

we're
not
in
1952.
the
--
the
baer
decision.
the
tax
court
--
earlier
tax
court
case
though,
assumed
that
it
was
a
trade
or
business
which
at
least
in
our
view,
that's
the
only
change
made
in
1942
and
it's
about
what
was
the
--
the
jurisdictional
kind
of
activity.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
case
of
many
respect
is
quite
different
from
the
gilmore
case.
for
one
thing,
the
facts
disclosed
a
much
more
amicable
dissolution
of
the
marriage
relationship.
the
parties
were
married
for
a
long
time,
they
have
three
children,
one
had
reached
(inaudible).
in
1952,
19
--
i'm
sorry,
1955,
mrs.
patrick
sued
for
divorce.
this
seems
to
have
been
caused
by
the
presence
of
another
woman
that
mr.
patrick
was
expected
to
--
and
as
i've
understand
it,
ultimately
did
marry.
the
grounds
for
divorce
charged
was
adultery
but
before
an
answer
was
filed,
the
parties
negotiated
an
amicable
or
as
amicable
as
these
things
can
be
settlement
of
all
of
their
interest.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
divorce,
mr.
patrick
was
the
president
of
the
herald
publishing
company
in
rock
hill,
south
carolina
and
the
editor
of
the
newspaper
that
it
published
which
was
the
largest
paper
in
rock
hill.
he
owned
28%
of
the
stock
of
the
company,
his
wife
owned
28%
and
the
adult
son
owned
7%,
the
rest
of
the
stock
was
in
trust
for
the
three
children
that
have
been
established
by
mrs.
patrick's
father
who
apparently
was
the
founder
of
the
newspaper.
the
agreement
pending
--
i'm
sorry,
in
addition
to
the
stock,
the
parties
individually
owned
the
real
property
that
house
the
newspaper,
the
building
was
on
the
in
common.
mr.
patrick
owned
4/5th
interest
and
mrs.
patrick
to
1/5th
interest.
and
in
to
the
divorce
suit,
parties
that
i
said
negotiated
a
settlement
of
all
the
matters
outstanding
between
them.
the
--
each
party
in
fact
had
very
substantial
other
independent
income
producing
assets,
stocks
and
securities.
each
was
independently
solvent
and
the
agreement,
however,
dealt
this
exclusively
with
their
interest
in
the
newspaper
apart
from
the
usual
provisions
for
the
custody
of
the
children
and
disposing
of
the
personal
residence
and
a
general
provision
releasing
the
husband
from
all
further
rights
and
liabilities.
apart
from
that,
it
was
confined,
the
agreement
was
confined
to
unscrambling
their
mixed
up
interest
in
the
newspaper
business.
the
character
of
the
negotiation
is
fully
disclosed
by
the
depositions
in
the
record
of
the
attorneys
for
each
side
and
you
will
find
there's
no
disagreement
between
them
as
to
what
happened
and
at
the
time
seems
to
have
been
no
real
disagreement.
mrs.
patrick
was
quite
happy
to
have
mr.
patrick
continue
as
the
publisher
of
the
newspaper.
mr.
patrick
wanted
to
continue,
however,
his
attorney
advised
him
that
it
would
not
be
wise
to
continue
on
notwithstanding
the
present
climate
in
the
face
of
the
divorce
subject
to
being
outvoted
by
his
wife
and
the
adult
son
who
seemed
to
side
with
the
wife
and
therefore
advised
mr.
patrick
that
he
should
acquire
control
of
the
newspaper
if
he
was
going
to
continue
to
run
it.
the
wife
thought
that
was
very
sensible
and
he
was
entitled
to
that.
she
understood
perfectly
and
was
quite
happy
to
sell
her
shares
to
him
for
their
fair
value
in
exchange
of
other
securities
and
equal
value.
her
only
concern
was
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
children.
one
at
whom
was
already
in
the
business
and
another
of
whom
was
readying
to
go
into
the
business.
mr.
gilmore
was
quite
agreeable
to
that
since
the
children
were
also
the
objects
of
his
bounty
and
he
was
to
be
able
to
go
to
the
children.
the
result
was
an
agreement
that
mr.
gilmore
would
transfer
to
mrs.
gilmore
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
what?
pardon
me.
mr.
patrick
would
transfer
it
to
mrs.
patrick,
securities
of
the
value
equal
to
her
shares
in
the
publishing
company
which
was
agreed
to
be
$112,000.
she
would
transfer
to
him
her
shares
subject
to
the
condition
that
they
would
pass
on
his
death
or
an
earlier
sale
of
the
business.
those
shares
would
pass
on
equal
shares
to
the
three
children.
now,
the
real
estate
that
housed
the
publishing
company
was
the
parties
negotiated
a
new
long-term
lease
of
the
real
estate
with
the
corporation
then
they
joined
in
conveying
the
real
estate
subject
to
the
lease
to
a
trust
to
pay
the
income
to
mrs.
patrick
for
life
and
then
to
distribute
the
remainder
in
equal
shares
to
the
three
children.
now,
that
was
sum
in
substance
of
the
agreement
and
from
what
all
it
appears
that
was
all
the
negotiations
were
about.
in
conducting
these
negotiations
and
well,
the
fees
paid
--
the
husband
agreed
to
pay
the
wife's
fees,
legal
fees
in
connection
with
all
of
the
proceedings
which
amounted
to
$12,000
to
wife's
attorneys
and
$12,000
to
his
attorney.
he
paid
them
all.
they
were
allocated
by
agreement
of
the
parties
and
the
counsel,
4000
--
allocated
in
the
whole
$24,000
not
distinguishing
between
husband
and
wives.
they
allocated
$4000
to
the
divorce
in
sundry,
personal
matters,
the
custody
provisions
and
so
forth.
they
allocated
$16,000
to
the
negotiation
and
execution
of
the
stock
purchase
agreement
and
they
allocated
$4000
to
the
negotiation
and
execution
of
the
new
lease
of
the
real
property
and
the
creation
of
the
trust.
mr.
patrick
claimed
deductions
for
the
$16,000
allocable
to
the
stock
purchase
transaction
and
for
4/5ths
of
the
$4000
allocable
to
the
lease
and
trust
of
the
real
estate,
that
4/5ths
presumably
representing
his
4/5ths
interest
in
the
real
estate.
so
that
ended
up
to
$19,200
for
which
he
claimed
the
deduction.
that
was
upheld
by
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit.
now,
this
case
we
think
is
primarily
and
it's
primarily
aspects
very
different
from
gilmore
and
the
other
cases
in
the
deal
because
it
doesn't
really
involve
an
assertion
by
the
wife
of
any
rights
at
all,
marital,
property
or
otherwise.
what
it
namely
involved
is
the
husband's
negotiating
to
buy
her
stock
and
a
lease
by
them
of
real
estate
to
a
corporation.
and
for
that
reason,
the
main
reason
we
contend
that
most
of
the
fees
aren't
deductible
because
they
were
capital
and
not
because
they
were
personal
as
is
our
argument
in
gilmore.
i
would
take
the
items
one
at
a
time
and
analyze
them
in
those
terms.
i
would
then
come
back
to
consider
the
extent
to
which
they
were
latent
marital
rights
involved
and
what
significance
that
might
have
on
the
treatment
of
the
fees.
the
first
item
for
which
deductions
was
allowed
was
the
negotiation
of
the
stock
transfer
agreement,
namely,
his
transfer
of
$112,000
of
securities
to
her.
her
transfer
of
her
stock
in
newspaper
to
him
subject
to
the
condition
that
it
pass
on
his
death
to
the
children.
now,
we
say
that
there's
no
difference
from
the
negotiation
of
the
purchase
of
any
capital
asset.
it's
quite
true,
it's
quite
true
that
his
tenure
as
president,
one
which
the
court
of
appeals
relies
was
always
subject
to
the
will
of
the
people
who
owned
the
majority
of
the
stock,
namely
his
wife
and
his
adult
son.
and
he
could
be
certain
of
keeping
his
job
only
if
he
acquire
control
by
acquiring
some
of
their
stock
but
that's
always
true
and
that
doesn't
make
at
a
ordinary
business
expense
for
an
--
a
corporate
officer
to
go
out
and
negotiate
to
buy
up
a
controlling
interest
of
his
shares
which
i
grant
you,
it's
the
only
way
he
can
ensure
his
position.
but
there's
none
in
expense
of
carrying
on
his
trade
or
business
of
being
an
employee
to
buy
a
controlling
interest
in
the
stock.
the
second
aspect
of
a
transaction
was
the
new
lease,
the
real
estate
to
the
corporations,
new
long-term
lease
negotiated
before
they
created
a
trust.
now,
in
fact
the
--
mr.
gilmore
seems
who
have
been
acting
in
two
capacities
negotiating
that
lease,
one;
on
behalf
of
the
corporation,
the
lessee,
and
one
on
behalf
to
himself
and
his
wife
as
lessor
to
the
extent
that
the
fees
for
that
are
properly
chargeable
to
the
lessees
part
of
the
transaction
namely
the
corporation.
that
it
were
for
the
corporation's
benefit
to
get
the
long-term
lease
they
should've
been
paid
by
the
corporation
and
mr.
patrick's
payment
of
them
is
simply
a
contribution
of
capital
to
the
corporation
which
would
increase
his
basis
in
the
stock
in
the
corporation
but
isn't
a
current
expense
of
his.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
even
the
corporation
would
have
to
capitalize
them
and
amortize
them
over
the
term
of
the
lease.
with
--
negotiated
a
long-term
lease,
the
expenses
are
capitalized
and
you
amortize
them
over
the
period
at
you
have
occupancy.
as
to
the
part
of
the
fees
that
are
properly
allocable
to
representation
of
the
lessor's
interest
in
negotiating
that
lease,
they
are
simply
the
cost
of
obtaining
or
letting
property
for
a
long
term
which
the
cases
are
uniform
in
holding
must
be
capitalized.
if
you
expend
money
to
obtain
a
20-year
lease
of
property
through
--
for
you
to
own
the
property
you
lease
it
for
20
years,
the
fees
and
expenses
you
incur
in
doing
that
you
capitalized
and
amortize
over
the
20-year
period
deducting
1/20th
for
every
year.
so
those
fees
are
equally
capital
expenditures
that
must
be
capitalized.
they
would
go
to
the
trust
to
whom
they
gave
the
property
that
was
treated
as
a
gift,
for
trust
would
require
the
right
to
amortize
those
deductions.
the
final
item
is
the
creation
of
the
trust
and
the
transfer
to
the
trust
of
the
real
property,
this
is
a
trust
for
the
life
of
the
wife
income
to
her
--
for
her
life
and
then
to
the
children.
now,
that
is
we
say
unlike
the
other
items
i've
discussed,
an
entirely
crystal
item
not
to
the
extent
that
the
wife
got
something
by
that
transaction
to
the
extent
that
her
life
estate
was
worth
more
than
her
1/5th
interest
in
the
fee
which
she
gave
up.
there
was
a
net
transfer
to
her
to
the
extent
that
that
was
--
we
don't
have
the
values
in
the
record
so
i
don't
know,
to
the
extent
that
there
was
a
net
transfer
to
her.
that
presumably
was
in
recognition
of
her
marital
rights,
her
rights
to
maintenance
and
support.
and
for
the
reasons
i
argued
in
gilmore
and
we'll
argue
later
here,
that's
purely
personal.
the
transfer
of
the
remainder
to
the
children
in
the
real
estate
was
either
a
gift
by
mr.
patrick
to
the
children
or
as
we
view
it
as
being
coerced
by
mrs.
patrick
a
transfer
to
her
and
a
gift
by
her
to
the
children.
but
anyway
you
view
it,
it
is
still
simply
a
purely
personal
intra-family
rearrangement
of
property
interest.
i
might
say
that
that
is
equally
true
of
the
remainder
interest
in
the
corporate
stock
which
on
his
death
was
to
go
to
the
children.
that
element,
the
corporate
stock
transaction
is
also
tainted
with
personal
aspect.
but
either
way,
all
of
these
expenses
were
either
capital.
most
of
them
i
think
were
capital
or
personal.
now,
the
difference
where
the
capital
or
personal,
the
capital
would
then
be
added
in
the
basis
and
recovered
later
against
sales
proceeds
or
amortized,
if
the
person
only
not
recoverable
at
all.
for
that
problem
doesn't
need
to
concern
us
here.
our
only
question
whether
currently
deductible
and
either
way
they're
not.
well,
that's
analyzing
the
transaction
in
terms
of
the
specific
items
of
the
agreement.
it's
also
a
suggestion
however
in
the
lower
courts
that
while
the
wife
didn't
actually
assert
any
general
marital
rights
to
a
large
property
settlement
of
his
property,
she
had
those
rights
and
they
were
latent
and
in
the
background,
and
mr.
patrick's
own
property
was
not
really
safe
until
they
got
the
agreement
and
so
a
part
of
the
fees
ultimately
also
served
the
purpose
of
forestalling
the
assertion
by
mrs.
patrick
of
her
rights
to
support
and
maintenance
or
a
fair
share
of
his
property.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
based
--
yes.
yes,
and
basically
i
think
that's
true,
that's
true.
if
two
people
have
common
in
--
both
own
stock
in
a
corporation
and
they
have
a
falling
out
over
a
poker
game,
there's
a
good
reason
for
one
to
buy
out
the
other
and
the
fact
that
the
falling
out
here
was
over
marriage
rather
than
a
poker
game,
it
doesn't
really
change
the
basic
character
of
the
transactions
so
far
as
simply
--
it
is
simply
buying
by
him
of
her
stock.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
his
attorney
said
that
mrs.
patrick
didn't
want
anything
for
herself.
she
was
only
concern
to
protect
the
interest
of
their
children
so
they
ultimately
got
the
newspaper
which
was
her
father's
newspaper.
and
his
attorney
said
that
he
understood
she
didn't
want
anything
for
herself.
rather
--
there
was
really
no
assertion
by
her
of
marital
right
and
in
fact
his
attorney
said
that
he
didn't
want
to
resist
whatever
she
wanted.
he
wanted
to
do
what
was
right
by
her
so
that
is
really
a
very
amicable
arrangement.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
her
marriage
to
the
extent
that
they
were
antagonistic
on
the
interest
on
which
they
worked.
i
--
at
least
his
attorney
testified
that
he
was
quite
happy
because
he
wanted
the
property
to
go
to
the
children
too.
she
just
want
to
make
sure
it
was
going
to
go
and
not
go
to
the
other
woman
he
was
going
to
marry.
she
want
--
make
it
--
get
it
tied
up
which
--
which
really
(inaudible)
anticipatory
estate
plan.
but
they
don't
really
have
been
antagonistic
to
the
extent
that
you
analyze
it
in
terms
of
her
coercion
and
his
making
this
transfer
under
her
coercion.
it
is
equivalent
to
--
of
it
--
transfer
to
her
and
to
that
extent,
i
would
agree
a
recognition
of
her
marital
rights
because
that
is
her
leverage.
it
is
the
existence
of
her
marital
rights.
so,
to
the
--
to
that
extent,
marital
rights
are
involved
and
i'm
willing
to
accept
further
the
suggestion
of
the
courts
below
that
their
presence
in
the
background
was
felt
and
heart
of
the
attorney's
fee
should
be
allocated
to
the
indirect
purpose
of
forestalling
an
overt
assertion
of
the
marital
rights.
they
had
arrived
at
a
satisfactory
agreement
because
if
they
didn't,
she
could
thread
out
for
a
much
larger
demands.
and
so
to
that
extent
you
can
say
that
part
of
the
fee
should
be
attributed
to
forestalling
an
assertion
of
those
rights.
now,
we're
quite
happy
to
view
it
that
way.
how
it
helps
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that
is
purely
personal.
now,
how
it
helps
the
taxpayer
to
view
it
that
way,
i
don't
know.
but
the
lower
courts
relied
almost
exclusively
on
that
element
that
she
had
these
personal
rights
so
she
could've
assert

of
my
