justice
hugo
l.
black
now
is
that
a
variance
from
your
view
--
do
you
consider
that
a
variance
of
the
gilmore
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
barnett,
let
me
ask.
excuse
me.
are
you
adding
something?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
one
question?
i
could
understand
--
i
do
not
quite
yet
understand
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
my
fault.
it's
my
fault,
it's
not
yours.
i
want
to
give
you
the
simplest
kind
of
limitation
first
so
that
i
can
get
the
idea
of
what
the
basic
argument
is.
let's
take
a
case
in
the
state
like
mine
that
i
came
from
was
--
he
didn't
have
any
community
property
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
have
any
community
property
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
had
a
business
worth
$250,000.
he
went
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
within
his
name.
it
was
wholly
his
under
the
laws
of
that
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
and
his
wife
get
in
a
lawsuit
so
that's
a
divorce,
an
alimony.
justice
hugo
l.
black
she
claims
that
she
ought
to
have
either
all
of
it
because
of
the
enormity
of
his
offense
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
she
claimed
that
she
ought
to
have
had
both
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
fights
undoubtedly
and
literally
speaking
with
her
to
conserve
his
interest
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
that
income-producing
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
he
be
entitled
under
your
argument
to
any
deduction
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
not,
what
is
the
basis
of
the
--
of
the
reason
that
he
wouldn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
make
it
as
simple
as
possible
that
everybody
knows.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did
it
to
save
his
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
literal
language
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
would
cover
it,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
when
congress
passed
it
as
an
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
says
something
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
it
says
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
lawyers
can
draw
many
distinctions
as
they
come
along
but
did
they
actually
cover
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
isn't
it
asking
for
an
exception
and
maybe
you
are
right
in
there.
i'm
not
saying
that
you're
not
right.
maybe
you
are
right
in
there
but
that
does
not
require
an
exception
to
the
language
which
an
ordinary
congressmen
would
pass
his
act
if
he
don't
think
what
it
meant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
they
pass?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
(voice
overlap),
i'm
talking
about
defending
the
property
that
you
have
which
is
the
basis
of
your
livelihood
from
a
claim
by
somebody
else
who
wants
to
take
it
away
from
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
kind
of
claims.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
we
are
to
draw
exceptions
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
will
be
the
line?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
was
just
thinking
it
sounds
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
very
much
like
it
might
come
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
notice
the
heading
of
this
section
that
says
non-trade
or
non-business
essential
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
think
of
any
better
way
of
managing
income
bearing
property
and
try
to
keep
somebody
taking
away
from
you
in
a
lawsuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
take
it
away
from
you
and
somebody
else
so
far
as
the
loss
is
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
that
upfront?
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
of
the
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
of
the
income-producing
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
allowed
--
allowable
or
disallowable
in
--
under
present
regulations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
was
the
law
as
an
enacted
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
change
added
to
this
--
the
congress
in
1942
changed
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
regarding
our
higgins
decision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
of
the
courts
began
to
change,
didn't
they?
