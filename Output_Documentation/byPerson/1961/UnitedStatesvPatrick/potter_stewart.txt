what
i'm
about

the

so
they're

i

he

i

that.

he

transferred
that,
her
20%.
justice

the

was
to
go

her

the
remainder
to
the
children.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
his
80%
interest
is
roughly
equivalent
to
the
value
of
the
stock

he
purchased

this
isn't
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
the
difficulty
with
this
aspect
of
your
case,
and
indeed
with
your
whole
position,
this
that
contrary
to
the
views
of
the
good
many
enlightened
people,
a
divorce
action
in
every
state
is
still
cast
in
terms
of
an
adversary
lawsuit
between
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant.
i
say
that
there
are
good
many
people
think
that
this
historical
is
--
is
obsolete,
but
it
has
roots,
historically
deep
roots
and
this
is
the
way
it
is,
it's
between
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant.
justice
potter
stewart
the
plaintiff
alleges
wrongdoing
and
the
defendant
defends
the
–
deny
the
wrong
doing
or
sometimes
files
a
counterclaim
alleging
the
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
whole
thing
is
based
upon
guilt
along
with
aggression
or
so
on,
trying
to
--
one
party
trying
to
establish
a
statutory
ground
for
divorce
and
thereby
win
an
adversary
lawsuit.
and
in
such
a
--
in
such
a
setting,
artificial
or
obsolete
as
that
may
be,
how
can
you
--
how
can
you
distinguish
it
from
an
--
any
kind
of
an
adversary
lawsuit?
and
how
certainly
can
you
distinguish
the
payment
of
the
wife's
counsel
fees
by
the
--
by
this
husband
as
a
--
is
different
from
any
other
case
where
a
judge
is
enti

a
judge
has
discretion
to
award
the
plaintiff's
counsel
fees
as
part
of
the
judgment
against
the
defendant.
certainly
–-
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
too
would
be
preserved
--
in
trying
to
preserve
the
defendant's
property.
nobody
i
should
think
would
claim
that
--
that
part
of
an
award
and
another
kind
of
a
lawsuit
would
be
--
would
be
deductible
to
this
action.
justice
potter
stewart
and
good
many
lawsuits
have
said
--
justice

adversary
lawsuits
are
settled
and
where
these

there

isn't
that
correct?
justice

this
was
all
in
the
setting
of
a
lawsuit
between
a
plaintiff

a
defendant.
as
i
say,
out
of
date

obsolete

reflective
of

dark
ages

that
concept

if

if
in

in

domestic
relations,
that
still
is
the
concept

that
it's
an
adversary
lawsuit

not
