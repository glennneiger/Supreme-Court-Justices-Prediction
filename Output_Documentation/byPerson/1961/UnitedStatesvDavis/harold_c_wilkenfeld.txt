mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
number
268
to
which
i
shall
now
address
myself
is
one
in
which
the
government
is
the
respondent
rather
than
the
petitioner.
however,
by
agreement
with
counsel
and
in
the
interest
to
somewhat
more
orderly
argument,
we
shall
present
the
case
for
the
government
at
this
time.
essentially,
this
is
related
to
the
gilmore
and
patrick
cases
which
have
already
been
heard.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
husband
who
has
paid
on
behalf
of
his
wife,
the
fees
incurred
by
her
for
tax
advice
which
he
has
received
in
connection
with
the
divorce
proceeding
and
the
negotiation
of
the
property
settlement
agreement,
whether
the
husband
in
such
a
case
is
entitled
to
deduct
the
fee
paid
to
the
wife's
attorney.
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
the
services
--
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
--
the
services
concerned
here
are
services
for
tax
advice
or
tax
counsel.
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
that
is
advised
as
to
the
tax
consequences
of
the
arrangement
which
was
being
entered
into
between
husband
and
wife
in
connection
with
the
divorce
proceeding.
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
the
court
of
claims
had
before
it
in
this
case
two
distinct
classes
of
legal
fees.
one
class
was
legal
fees
which
were
paid
by
the
husband
both
to
his
--
his
own
attorney
and
to
his
wife's
attorney
for
services
rendered
in
the
negotiation
and
preparation
of
the
properties
settlement
agreement
and
other
documents
and
transfers
in
connection
therewith.
the
other
set
of
legal
fees
were
fees
paid
by
the
husband
both
to
his
attorney
and
to
his
wife's
attorney
for
services
rendered
by
them
in
furnishing
advice
as
to
the
tax
consequences
of
the
transaction.
the
court
of
claims
found
as
to
the
latter
that
each
attorney
was
rendering
services
for
his
own
client.
this
again,
emphasizing
the
advisory
character
of
the
divorce
proceeding.
and
that
the
husband
was,
therefore,
not
entitled
to
deduct
the
fee
pay
to
his
wife
--
to
his
wife's
attorney
on
account
of
advice
for
tax
counsel
which
he
had
received.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
of
claims
held
that
the
husband
was
entitled
to
deduct
that
portion
of
the
fee
paid
to
his
own
attorney
which
was
allocable
to
tax
advice
which
he
had
received
from
his
own
attorney.
the
statutory
provision
upon
which
the
court
of
claims
relied
is
a
different
subsection
of
section
212
of
the
1954
internal
revenue
code
then
the
subsections
which
were
involved
in
the
gilmore
and
patrick
cases
in
which
the
court
heard
this
morning.
in
the
previous
cases,
the
subsections
involved
were
one
and
two
of
section
212.
those
sections
traced
back
to
section
23
(a)
(2)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
and
where
primarily
the
product
of
the
case
of
higgins
against
commissioner
decided
by
this
court
in
1941.
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
subsection
3
which
is
the
one
involved
in
this
proceeding
was
passed
in
1954,
was
not
in
the
law
before
then
in
any
form.
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
passed
expressly
in
view
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
lykes
against
commissioner
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
in
the
gilmore
and
patrick
cases.
the
lykes
case
as
my
associate
mr.
barnett
pointed
out
this
morning
held
that
legal
fees
paid
in
disputing
a
gift
tax
assessment
were
personal
in
character
and
that
their
proximate
cost
was
the
gift,
and
that
a
gift
is
a
personal
intrafamily
transaction.
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
passed
in
direct
consideration
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
higgins
v.
commissioner
decided
in
1941
and
23
(a)
(2)
was
added
--
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
quite
so,
quite
so.
the
very
question
in
this
case
is
the
extent
of
the
expansion.
we
view
section
212
(3)
which
speaks
of
expenses
incurred
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
in
connection
with
the
determination,
collection
or
refund
of
any
tax.
we
conceive
of
this
as
being
very
narrow
in
its
scope
and
application.
and
as
leaving
a
good
thought
of
the
rationale
and
decision
of
the
lykes
case,
remaining
as
good
and
applicable
law
which
we
feel
is
controlling
in
this
case
and
should
deny
the
grant
of
a
deduction
on
account
of
any
fees
incurred
by
this
taxpayer
for
advice
either
as
to
his
own
tax
consequences
or
as
to
the
tax
consequences
of
the
wife's
aspect
of
the
divorce
settlement.
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
the
--
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
the
house
and
senate
committee
reports
are
quoted
in
our
brief
at
pages
46,
the
house
report
and
at
page
48,
senate
report.
the
court
will
note
that
the
italicized
words
in
the
committee
reports
speak
of
contest
over
tax
matters.
the
words
used
in
section
212
(3),
we
think
were
used
with
very
careful
deliberation.
the
word
“determination”
for
example
is
a
word
with
very
precise
meaning
and
its
very
origin,
the
word
“determination”
implies
the
coming
to
a
final
decision
whether
it'd
be
the
final
decision
itself
or
the
process
of
arriving
at
a
final
decision.
and
under
the
well-accepted
principle
of
noscitur
a
sociis
we
feel
that
the
word
“determination”
here
taken
in
the
context
of
collection
or
refund
indicates
that
congress
intended
that
this
word
be
used
in
a
very
narrow
sense
and
not
in
the
sense
of
a
mere
prediction
or
forecast
or
advice
of
a
preliminary
characteristic
to
the
possible
tax
consequences
of
some
transaction
which
either
has
not
yet
been
entered
into
or
is
in
the
process
of
being
entered
into
but
not
yet
consummated.
the
regulations
i
think
indicate
quite
clearly
that
this
is
the
understanding
of
the
commissioner
as
to
the
scope
of
the
expansion
of
the
lykes
case
in
the
adaption
of
section
212
(3).
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
i
think
that
when
one
reads
the
report
--
reports,
in
the
context
of
the
lykes
case
which
had
just
been
decided
and
which
is
the
decision
referred
to
in
the
report,
and
in
the
context
of
the
prior
treasury
regulations
which
are
quoted
in
the
lykes'
decision,
one
can
see
that
the
congress
was
using
the
word
“determination”
in
a
narrow
sense
such
i
have
suggested.
the
lykes'
opinion
quotes
with
approval
from
the
regulation
which
was
enforced
prior
to
the
adaption
of
section
212
(3).
at
page
126
of
the
opinion
in
lykes
which
is
at
343
u.s.,
the
previous
regulation
is
quoted
almost
in
full.
that
is
there
said
that,
“expenses
paid
or
incurred
by
an
individual
in
determining
or
contesting,
determining
or
contesting
any
liability
asserted
against
him
do
not
become
deductible
merely
because
of
maybe
necessary
for
him
to
dispose
of
property
which
maybe
income-producing
in
order
to
satisfy
the
liability.”
the
context
in
which
the
word
“determination”
is
here
used
is
the
context
of
a
contest,
a
determination
which
results
in
tax
liability
and
not
merely
a
determination
which
is
in
the
nature
of
a
forecast,
a
weather
prediction
which
may
or
may
not
be
reliable
because
the
circumstances
are
not
yet
fixed.
the
circumstances
themselves
are
not
yet
determined
so
that
the
tax
cannot
be
determined.
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
yes,
it
does.
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
the
--
the
commissioner
has
somewhat
expanded
the
interpretation
which
might
be
indicated
by
the
legislative
history.
but
we
believe
that
that
expansion
is
consistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
in
other
words,
the
commissioner
has
said
that
expenses
incurred
in
the
preparation
of
tax
returns
are
deductible.
now,
in
our
system
of
taxation,
the
preparation
of
a
tax
return
certainly
in
--
of
a
federal
context
is
a
determination
unlike
the
british
system.
in
the
british
system,
the
taxpayer
merely
reports
the
amount
of
his
income.
the
assessment
is
made
at
some
subsequent
date.
in
our
system,
the
taxpayer
assesses
himself.
he
computes
his
tax
and
he
pays
it.
and
in
most
instances,
certainly
in
many
instances,
this
is
the
last
act
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
his
tax
for
that
particular
period.
it
maybe
post-order
that
it
may
not.
it
may
go
into
the
file.
it
may
merely
result
in
an
entry
of
the
item
on
an
assessment
list
which
is
automatically
recorded
and
goes
into
the
files.
the
preparation
of
the
return
in
and
of
itself
can
be
in
--
and
many
cases
is
the
final
act
of
determination.
and
so
we
believe
that
it
was
proper
for
the
commissioner
to
say
that
the
word
“determination”
in
the
context
of
the
american
tax
system
includes
the
preparation
of
a
return.
now,
there
is
further
language
in
the
regulation
which
seems
to
have
puzzled
the
court
of
claims
somewhat
and
that
is
the
reference
to
expenses
for
tax
counsel.
these
words
we
feel
must
be
taken
within
the
context
of
the
balance
of
the
regulation
and
certainly
within
the
statute
itself.
if
they
are
to
any
extent
ambiguous,
i
believe
that
it
is
certainly
proper
to
refer
to
the
statute
in
interpreting
the
regulation.
and
the
statute
itself
and
its
history
are
quite
clear
in
indicating
that
in
matters
relating
to
non-income
tax
determinations,
only
those
counsel
fees
which
relate
to
the
preparation
of
the
return,
a
determination
in
the
nature
of
a
dispute,
the
refund
of
tax
or
the
collection
of
tax
can
be
deducted.
we
emphasize
this
because
--
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
i
should
like
to
distinguish
between
the
income
tax
situation
and
the
any
tax
other
than
income
tax
situation
in
answering
this
question.
it
has
been
clear
for
many
years
and
certainly
was
clear
at
the
time
of
the
adaption
of
the
1954
revenue
code
and
the
insertion
of
212
(3)
into
the
law.
that
advice
received
in
connection
with
income
tax
matters
whether
it'd
be
in
advance
of
a
projected
transaction,
whether
it'd
be
of
an
investment
character
that
all
such
advice
was
deductible
provided
that
it
met
the
provisions
of
section
23
(a)
(2)
or
now
212
(1)
and
(2).
in
other
words,
if
these
were
expenses
for
the
production
or
collection
of
income
or
for
the
management,
conservation
or
maintenance
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income,
these
expenses
were
deductible
irrespective
of
whether
the
tax
advice
was
received
in
connection
with
a
consummated
transaction
or
a
transaction
which
was
contemplated
or
one
which
might
never
be
entered
into.
however,
the
lykes
case
did
not
deal
with
an
income
tax
matter
at
all.
the
lykes
case
dealt
with
a
gift
tax
deficiency
and
held
that
legal
fees
incurred
in
disputing
a
gift
tax
deficiency
were
personal
in
character
and
non-deductible.
as
the
one
now
reads,
the
express
holding
of
the
lykes
case
has
been
overruled
by
212
(3)
because
the
legal
fees
there
involved
would
now
be
expressly
deductible
under
subsection
3.
this
is
not
to
say,
however,
that
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
and
we
certainly
deny
that
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
say
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
212
(3)
to
expand
as
to
non-income
tax
matters,
all
sorts
of
expenses
which
might
be
incurred
in
other
than
the
particular
situations
which
are
set
out
to
a
determination,
collection
or
refund
of
any
tax
so
that
in
the
present
case,
we
have
two
problems
which
emanate
from
this.
first,
it
is
not
clear
from
the
facts
to
what
extent
these
fees
were
paid
for
income
tax
advice
or
for
advice
with
regard
to
other
taxes.
the
finding
of
the
court
of
claims
which
is
at
page
121
of
--
of
the
record
finding
number
20,
there
is
no
testimony
or
evidence
in
this
case
from
which
it
can
be
--
can
be
determined
the
extent
to
which
the
attorney's
fees
paid
by
mr.
davis
either
to
mr.
young,
his
own
attorney
or
to
mr.
morford,
his
wife's
attorney
were
reasonably
allocable
to
the
effort
of
mr.
davis
to
retain
his
shares
of
du
pont
and
there
--
thereby
to
preserve
his
position.
and
then
on
page
119
and
going
over
to
page
120,
it
is
expressly
stated
that
the
court
was
unable
to
determine
to
what
extent
these
services
related
to
income
tax
or
the
gift
tax
matters
but
that
there
was
a
merging
of
both
income
and
gift
tax
advice.
but
we
do
not
feel
that
even
had
there
been
any
clear-cut
allocation
of
the
fee
as
between
income
tax
advice
or
gift
tax
advice
that
even
the
income
tax
advice
would
be
deductible
for
we
say,
and
i'm
speaking
now
of
the
husband,
the
husband's
tax
advice
for
we
say
that
this
was
clearly
personal
to
the
same
extent
as
the
other
fees
paid
in
the
divorce
proceeding
were
personal.
as
to
the
fees
which
may
have
been
paid
for
gift
tax
advice,
we,
again,
say
that
the
fees
paid
were
personal
and
we
also
say
that
it
was
not
the
intention
of
congress
in
enacting
212
(3)
to
permit
the
deduction
of
legal
fees
incurred
in
estate
planning,
that
is
for
the
preparation
of
inter
vivos
trust
for
the
preparation
of
wills
even
though
in
their
preparation,
a
considerable
amount
of
thought
was
given
to
the
possible
gift
tax
consequences
or
to
the
possible
estate
tax
consequences
of
such
preparation.
there
is
a
narrower
ground
upon
which
the
decision
below
can
be
affirmed
and
that
is
the
one
upon
which
the
court
of
claims
decided
that
the
husband
was
not
entitled
to
a
deduction
on
account
of
the
fees
paid
to
his
wife's
attorney.
this
court
has
many
times
held
that
a
deduction
belongs
only
to
the
person
whose
affairs
gave
rise
to
it,
that
a
deduction
cannot
by
contract
or
by
any
other
legally
binding
arrangement
be
transferred
from
one
taxpayer
to
another
so
that
the
transferee
of
the
deduction
maybe
permitted
to
take
it
just
as
the
transferor
of
the
deduction
may
have
been
able
to.
we
do
not
concede
--
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
i
believe
that
the
question
indicates
the
answer.
insofar
as
expenses
of
this
character
are
concerned,
unlike
medical
expenses
which
go
into
another
area
not
as
the
purely
legislative
grace
because
these
--
mr.
harold
c.
wilkenfeld
yes.
the
suggestion
is
made
in
taxpayer's
brief
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
these
were
necessaries
that
the
husband
was
obligated
to
protect
his
wife
and
supply
such
funds
necessary
to
provide
her
with
legal
counsel
when
she
needed
it.
this,
i
think
suggests
the
--
the
very
answer
because
as
to
the
wife,
possibly,
possibly
although
we
deny
it,
she
might
be
entitled
to
a
deduction
on
account
of
tax
advice
which
she
receives.
but
when
the
husband
pays
this,
he
is
not
paying
a
fee
or
an
expense
which
is
related
in
any
sense
to
his
business
affairs.
he's
paying
something
which
is
imposed
upon
him
because
of
the
marriage
contract
just
as
in
interstate
transit
lines
against
commissioner.
the
payment
by
the
parent
of
the
subsidiary's
deficit
was
imposed
upon
it
and
was
legally
binding
by
reason
of
a
contract
entered
into
between
the
parent
and
subsidiary.
but
one
must
look
to
the
source
of
the
expense.
and
in
this
case,
the
source
of
the
expense
had
no
relation
to
the
husband's
income-producing
activities
or
to
his
