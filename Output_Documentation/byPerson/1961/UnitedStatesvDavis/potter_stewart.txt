justice

--
no
property
rights
in
what's
involved
here.
justice
potter
stewart
wait
a
minute
mr.
kutz.
we're
not
talking
about
the
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
he's
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
any
expenses
would
be
charged
to
him.
justice
potter
stewart
this
--
this
agreement
was
made
while
they
were
husband
and
wife?
justice
potter
stewart
before
any
suit
for
divorce
have
been
filed?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
the
entire
agreement
between
the
party
where
there
was
--
in
addition
to
this,
there
was
no
alimony,
no
support
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
precisely
the
same
result
would
follow
where
this
denominated
as
a
gift
or
working
on,
made
it
as
a
division
of
property,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
it
goes
as
the
--
the
wife's
subsequent
basis
were
concerned
and
all
other
tax,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
like
the
court
of
claims
here,
placed
it's
decision
upon
its
inability
to
place
evaluation
upon
what
it
was
that
the
wife
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
paid
or
gave
up.
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
this
case
--
these
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
these
expenditures
were
made
at
the
time
when
the
parties
were
man
and
wife,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
presumably,
i
suppose
in
the
state
of
delaware
as
in
most
states,
the
husband
had
the
legal
duties
of
--
to
support
his
wife.
certainly
under
that
doctrine
if
it's
the
wife's,
let's
take
something
that's
clearly
deductible,
medical
expenses
beyond
3%,
if
the
man
and
the
wife
are
--
are
man
and
wife
and
if
the
wife
has
medical
expenses
beyond
3%
of
the
adjusted
gross
income,
those
are
deductible
although
the
--
clearly
the
wife's
and
only
the
wife's
expendents
--
expenses
if
the
husband
pays
for
her
under
deductible
gross
income
of
that,
simply
because
of
that
legal
obligation
that
he
has
to
pay
for
her
expenses.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
was
just
trying
to
get
something
that's
clearly
deductible.
there's
an
argument
here
which
you've
made
up
to
this
point
as
to
whether
or
not
fees
would
be
deductible
even
if
they
were
his
expenditures
or
his
tax
advice.
but
now
you're
turning
and
you
say
alternatively,
this
case
can
be
decided
on
a
narrower
point
as
i
understand
it.
that
is
that
even
if
deductible
to
him,
they
would
not
be
deductible
from
his
income
because
they
were
his
wife's
expenditures,
isn't
that
the
point
you're
now
about
to
make?
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
don't
quite
--
i
perhaps
being
obtuse
because
i
know
this
is
a
distinction
that
you
spend
a
good
time
on
your
brief.
i
realize
that
there
are
differences
but
this
is
--
this
is
not
a
division
of
jointly
owned
property
or
partnership
property
or
community
property.
this
is
a
conveyance
to
the
wife
of
the
husband's
property
which
is
belonged
exclusively
to
him
and
i
don't
quite
see
what
the
--
what
the
great
difference
is
between
this
case
and
--
and
halliwell
and
mesta
under
those
circumstances.
i
would
understand
your
point
that
these
were
jointly
owned
property
or
if
they
are
on
argument
about
who
owned
or
if
it
were
community
property
but
this
is
his
property,
solely
his,
exclusively
his
that
he's
transferring
to
her
and
return
for
her
relinquishment
of
marital
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
to
your
view,
the
--
the
wife
would
have
as
her
basis,
one
of
the
husband's
bases
--
no,
no
she
haven't
--
she'd
have
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
she'd
have
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
know,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
wouldn't
it
inevitably
follow
that
the
wife
would
take
the
husband's
basis
if
your
view
--
if
your
view
is
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
obviously
she
pays
the
tax
but
she
sells
that
if
she
has
a
capital
gain,
what's
important
is
what
her
basis
is.
justice
potter
stewart
her
basis
would
be
the
--
the
--
the
husband's
basis
just
as
over
a
gift
she
would
take
(inaudible)
basis.
justice
potter
stewart
if
your
view
is
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
also
contend
that
you
can
defend
this
judgment
in
your
favor
in
any
grounds?
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
do
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
--
how
is
that
point
helped
you
on
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
because
the
agreement
(inaudible)
date
of
the
actual
transfer?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
or
is
it
possible
to
bargain
(inaudible)
to
be
the
value
as
of
the
date
of
transfer
and
(inaudible)
agreement.
(inaudible)
down
that
we've
agreed
that
whatever
it
is,
whatever
value
maybe
on
that
day,
a
year
now
is
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
may
i,
mr.
chief
justice,
ask
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
this
question?
in
a
community
property
state,
mr.
kutz,
would
the
result
be
different,
if
your
position
is
accepted,
would
the
result
be
different
in
justice
potter
stewart
california?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
would
be
a
true
division
of
property?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
if
we
accept
your
contention,
the
result
would
be
that
there
would
be
variants
between
community
property
states
and
common-law
states
inevitable?
justice
potter
stewart
i
appreciate
this.
