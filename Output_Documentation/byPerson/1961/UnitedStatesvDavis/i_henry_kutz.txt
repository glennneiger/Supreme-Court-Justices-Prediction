mr.
i.
henry
kutz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
consolidated
peti
--
cross-petitions,
my
associate,
mr.
wilkenfeld
will
state
the
facts
and
give
the
argument
in
number
268
in
which
the
united
states
is
respondent.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
will
argue
number
190
in
which
the
united
states
is
the
petitioner.
the
issues
in
number
190,
and
the
questions
are
quite
desperate
in
the
two
cross-petitions,
the
issue
in
number
190
is
whether
a
taxpayer
husband
realized
capital
gain
when
he
transferred
to
his
former
wife,
a
stock
which
had
appreciated
in
value
during
his
ownership.
and
when
the
transfer
was
made
in
consideration
of
the
wife's
release
of
his
marital
obligations
to
her,
the
court
of
claims
have
--
has
held
that
no
capital
gain
was
realized
but
in
so
ruling
expressly
recognized
conflict
with
decisions
of
the
second
and
the
third
circuit.
on
the
other
hand,
it
found
support
in
the
reasoning
of
the
decision
by
the
sixth
circuit.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
both
taxpayer
and
his
former
wife
were
residence
of
delaware
and
all
the
property
involved
was
located
in
delaware.
taxpayer
was
the
director
and
vice
president
of
the
du
com
--
du
pont
company
and
the
stock
in
issue
is
du
pont
stock.
serious
marital
disputes
arose
between
them.
and
by
july
1954,
they
had
both
retained
attorneys
and
property
settlement
negotiations
commenced
being
conducted
through
the
attorneys.
in
november
1954,
a
formal
property
settlement
agreement
was
arrived
at
and
signed.
and
the
court
explicitly
found
that
all
the
property
involved
in
the
settlement
negotiations
was
owned
by
mr.
davis,
subject
only
to
her
marital
rights
under
the
laws
of
delaware.
those
were
the
marital
rights
of
the
common
law
state
she
had.
i
will
describe
in
a
little
more
detail
later.
she
had
a
dower,
the
common
law
dower
interest
in
his
real
estate,
otherwise,
no
property
rights
in
his
estate.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
that's
correct.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
that's
right.
the
agreement,
so
far
is
pertinent,
however,
provided
for
various
transfers
made
by
him
to
her
under
specific
categories.
the
agreement
was
wrong
to
say
that
this
and
this
shall
be
transferred
to
her
for
her
support
and
this
and
that,
including
the
stock
here
involved,
shall
be
transferred
to
her
in
division
of
property.
but
--
in
as
much
as
she
had
no
--
no
property
in
the
stock,
it
will
be
our
contention
that
that's
a
mere
language
and
could
give
her
no
property.
the
--
so
far
as
pertinent,
the
agreement
provided
that
he
was
to
deliver
to
her
500
shares
of
the
du
pont
stock,
agreement
having
been
made
in
november
1954.
on
april
1,
1955
and
500
shares
of
du
pont
stock
on
april
1,
1956,
these
shares
were
to
be
delivered
to
her
at
his
cost
free
and
flair.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
and
no
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
--(voice
overlap)
and
everything
else.
in
other
words,
she
was
to
get
that
stock.
and
there's
no
provision
that
it
was
any
particular
stock
that
he
own.
he
could
go
out
and
buy
it.
indeed,
he's
just
part
of
it.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
that's
correct.
further,
for
her
support,
he
was
to
make
certain
monthly
payments.
and
in
addition,
he
was
per
some
commencing
january
1955
equal
to
the
dividends
declared
upon
the
du
pont's
stock
to
the
extent
that
he
hadn't
delivered
the
stock
to
her.
in
other
words,
if
du
pont
declared
dividends
before
he
actually
delivered
the
stock,
he
was
to
pay
her
an
equivalent
amount.
and
this
was
said
to
be
for
her
support.
in
consideration
of
all
of
the
transfers
both
those
label
for
support
and
those
label
as
divisions
of
property,
she
expressly
released
him
from
all
her
rights
against
his
property
and
for
any
claim
of
support
by
him
and
of
herself
or
their
child.
the
agreement
provided
that
if
a
divorce
was
obtained,
the
divorce
should
in
no
way
effect
the
obligations
of
the
party
under
the
agreement.
and
the
provisions
of
the
agreement
might
but
need
not
be
incorporated
in
the
divorce.
actually,
a
divorce
was
granted
by
a
nevada
court
in
january
1955,
a
couple
of
months
after
the
agreement,
the
decree
approved
the
settlement
agreement
and
directed
the
parties
to
carry
it
out.
the
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes.
there
was
ali
--
i
--
i
meant
to
mention,
if
i
haven't.
she
was
to
get
500
--
i
think
$50
a
month
for
ten
years
up
to
--
from
1954
to
1964
in
addition
to
lump
sum,
i
think
of
$25,000
and
in
january
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
there
were
also
some
insurance
policies
and
so
on.
the
commissioner
determined
a
deficiency
against
him
for
the
du
pont
stock
--
for
the
transfer
of
the
du
pont
stock.
on
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
thank
you,
your
honor.
on
march
21,
1955,
the
taxpayer
delivered
the
500
shares
of
du
pont
stock,
which
he
--
a
little
early,
he
was
supposed
to
deliver
it
on
april
1.
his
cost
basis
for
the
stock
was
$74,775
in
market
value,
at
the
time
of
transfer
was
$82,250.
the
commissioner
determined
that
he
had
realized
the
gain
between
the
cost
basis
and
the
market
value,
with
the
date
of
transfer
and
has
held
that
this
gain
was
in
the
amount
of
about
$7500.
the
court
below
did
not
rule
that
the
transfer
was
not
a
taxable
event,
but
relieved
the
husband
from
liability
only
because
it
felt
unable
to
measure
the
amount
of
the
taxable
gain.
that
is
the
value
of
the
discharge
of
his
marital
obligations,
a
consideration
which
he
received
for
the
transfer.
i
should
like,
however,
to
discuss
because
it
discussed
in
taxpayer's
brief
and
we
have
discussed
it
in
our
brief
whether
this
transfer
was
a
taxable
event.
the
pertinent
statutory
provisions
have
been
in
the
revenue
laws
for
many
years.
they're
the
ones
that
--
familiar
ones
that
deal
with
the
gain
on
--
or
loss
on
disposition
of
property
in
the
1954
code
which
governs
here,
section
1001
(a)
provides,
that
the
gain
from
the
sale
or
other
disposition
of
property
shall
be
the
excess
of
the
amount
realized
there
from
over
the
adjusted
basis.
in
subsection
b,
the
statute
defines
what
the
amount
realized
as.
the
amount
realized
from
the
sale
or
other
disposition
of
property
shall
be
the
sum
of
any
money
received
plus
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
other
than
money
received.
now,
we
say
that
it's
our
contention
and
that
is
the
sale
or
other
dispos
--
disposition
of
this
du
pont
stock,
in
exchange
for
the
discharge
of
the
marital
obligations
owed
by
taxpayer
to
his
wife,
was
a
discharge
of
a
legal
obligation
that
it's
the
familiar
situation,
where
taxes
have
often
--
have
been
assessed
without
any
question.
that
the
satisfaction
of
a
legal
obligation,
that
is
a
discharge
of
a
debt
is
a
receipt
to
the
obligor.
and
here,
he
used
property
which
had
appreciated
in
value
great
--
to
some
extent
during
his
period
of
ownership
and
he
used
it,
we
say
at
its
market
value,
he
is
therefore
liable
for
the
difference
between
the
basis
and
the
value
of
the
stock
at
the
time
of
transfer.
it's
the
same
as
if
he
had
sold
the
stock
and
used
the
proceeds
to
pay
the
debt,
that
he
goes
through
the
form
of
selling
a
stock
that
doesn't
go
through
the
form
of
the
selling
of
stock,
doesn't
take
away
from
his
realization
of
economic
gains
who
increased
in
market
value.
in
the
earlier
cases
decided
by
the
third
and
the
second
circuits
in
1941
and
1942,
this
was
the
holding,
and
in
those
cases
in
the
third
circuit
case,
the
mesta
case,
the
taxpayer
transferred
to
his
wife
a
stock
that
it
cost
him
$7500,
and
at
the
time
of
the
transfer,
it
was
worth
$156,000.
in
the
halliwell
case,
the
second
circuit
case,
he
transferred
stock
that
it
cost
a
$160,000
and
the
market
value
was
$461,000.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes,
your
honor,
they
both
were
marital
cases.
they
both
were
cases
where
in
this
charge
of
the
husband's
marital
obligations,
he
transferred
appreciated
property.
there
was
--
the
cases
were
hard
fought.
the
--
in
the
--
both
cases
represented
reversals
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals
and
in
the
mesta
case,
the
third
circuit
said
en
banc
and
there
were
--
it
was
a
three
to
two
decision,
but
they
have
been
the
law
since
1941
and
when
the
mesta
case
was
decided
and
the
first
questioning
of
them
in
long
--
in
the
period
of
about
20
years
from
that
time
to
this
was
in
the
sixth
circuit,
in
the
marshman
case,
decided
in
1960.
although,
that
case
actually
didn't
go
on
that
ground,
there
was
reasoning
in
it.
the
case
--
the
marshman
case
went
on
the
ground
that
the
market
value
of
the
security
there
in
option
couldn't
be
determined.
now,
taxpayer
argues
that
this
wasn't
a
taxable
event.
there
were
two
possible
categories
other
than
sale
or
exchange
that
this
might
fall
into.one
is,
that
it
was
a
division
of
property
of
a
--
between
the
spouses.
but
that
we
say
is
not
the
fact
under
the
state
of
the
law
of
delaware,
and
it
wasn't
then
the
halliwell
case,
the
second
circuit
case,
discussed
that
same
thing
under
the
similar
common-law
rules
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
there
was
nothing
that
could
have
prevented
mr.
davis
from
selling
his
stock
at
any
time.
his
wife
had
no
share
in
it.
it
wasn't
--
as
if
she
had
some
interest
in
it.
it
wasn't
a
division
of
property
at
all.
she
had
--
she
had
claims
against
him.
and
although,
the
claims
would
differ
on
--
depended
upon
his
ability
to
pay,
i'm
thinking
of
alimony,
that
is
none
unusual
situation.
it
was
a
claim.
it
was
his
property.
he
used
that
to
discharge
the
claim
against
him.
now,
another
possible
category
that
was
suggested
below
by
taxpayer,
but
is
not
suggested
in
his
brief
here
is
that
he
was
making
a
gift
to
her.
but
this
seems
completely
contrary
to
the
facts.
there
was
no
act
of
generosity.
they
bargained
very
closely,
and
he
got
consideration
for
it.
as
i
say,
taxpayer
has
not
advanced
that
ground
in
his
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
i
think
so
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
that's
a
--
that's
true.
now,
at
corollary
of
the
holding
here
will
be
the
wife's
basis.
now,
it
also
seems
to
us,
unrealistic
to
suppose
that
she
expected
she
was
going
to
get
her
husband's
lower
basis.
and
--
so
that
when
she
sold
the
stock,
she'd
have
to
pay
the
tax
which
he
would
normally
have
paid.
and
i've
--
i
stated
i
believe
a
--
if
the
court
will
recall
in
stating
the
terms,
the
agreement,
she
was
to
get
it
free
and
clear.
well
of
course,
that
wouldn't
prevent
it
from
being
free
and
clear,
but
i
think
like
in
the
mesta
case,
would
have
been
very
much
surprised
if
she
found
that
there's
$150,000
worth
of
--
of
stock
that
she
received,
she
had
a
cost
basis
of
$7500.
and
here,
although
the
difference
--
the
economic
gain
is
not
as
great,
i
think
it
is
normal
and
fairer
and
--
and
the
more
accurate
construction
of
the
agreement
of
the
parties
to
assume
that
she
took
it
at
the
basis
which
is
--
of
his
--
of
its
market
value
at
the
time
of
the
transfer.
now
--
and
also
an
important
consideration
is
that
this
has
been
a
law
for
approximately
20
years
that
undoubtedly
many
marital
agreements
have
been
made
based
on
the
mesta
and
halliwell
principle
which
our
leading
cases.
taxpayer
says
that
the
effect
of
--
of
the
decision
that
the
husband
is
taxable
will
create
a
difference
between
community
property
and
common-law
states
and
that's
a
bad
thing.
but
the
tax
laws
for
long
have
had
the
deal
with
that
difference.
it
exists
under
the
law,
the
separate
states.
congress
has
amended
the
tax
laws
when
it's
thought
wise
to
do
it.
this
rule
has
existed
for
many
years
and
the
court
--
the
courts
must
deal
with
the
property
law
of
the
states
as
it
finds
them.
and
it's
to
be
assumed
that
the
party's
contract
knowing
what
the
property
law
of
the
states
are.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
as
far
as
i
know
i
think
i
know,
yes.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
in
addition
to
the
court
of
claims,
yes
sir.
the
court
of
claims
in
its
opinion
if
your
honor
pleases
states
that
it
had
to
chose
between
mr.
halliwell
and
marshman
and
there
have
been
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
i
beg
your
honors.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
entirely
and
apparently
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
that
is
correct.
also,
if
i
may
add
this
to
my
answer
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
second
circuit
in
the
case
called
farid-es-sultaneh
and
the
third
--
and
the
fourth
circuit
have
been
at
the
case
called
commissioner
against
patino,
in
farid-es-sultaneh,
there
was
a
transfer
made
prior
to
marriage
and
in
release
of
marital
rights
antenuptial.
and
in
patino,
it
was
during
marriage
and
the
question
was
the
basis
of
the
wife
and
in
order
to
determine
the
basis
of
the
wife,
they
really
had
to
decide
this
question.
they
both
held
that
she
got
the
market
value
with
the
ba
--
basis
at
the
time
of
the
transfer.
now,
the
question
--
the
second
issue
in
the
case
is
how
is
this
property
to
be
valued?
he
gets
his
consideration
as
a
discharge
of
marital
rights.
now,
the
--
the
--
the
third
circuit
stated
in
the
mesta
case
that
it
would
be
assumed
that
the
parties
would
get
their
moneys
worth,
that
if
he
was
willing
to
transfer
this
appreciated
stock
and
he
could
have
easily
sold
it
and
given
her
the
money
instead
for
the
discharge
of
marital
rights
that
he
considered
he
was
getting
his
money's
worth.
the
court
of
claims
in
the
sixth
circuit
felt
that
the
marital
rights
value
could
not
be
estimated.
they
went
on
the
ground
that
it
was
impossible
to
ascertain
what
he
received
here.
they
said
that
tension
and
emotion
enter
into
marital
transactions
and
that
would
prevent
an
equality
of
value
or
transfer.
but
tension
and
emotion
certainly
under
into
many
transactions,
and
if
we
would
try
to
find
that
a
result
which
is
unjust,
we
would
say
we
will
make
no
decision.
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
taxpayer
if
these
values
are
not
equal
from
--
from
introducing
evidence
to
show
that
they
are
unequal.
but
presumably,
in
absence
of
any
evidence,
it's
fair
to
assume
and
a
more
reasonable
rule
and
one
which
would
protect
the
wife
from
having
the
husband's
basis
to
say
that
these
are
equality
of
exchanges.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
nothing
was
said
about
it,
sir.
there
was
none.
now,
for
the
first
time
in
his
brief
here,
counsel
has
made
two
contentions.
these
contentions
were
not
made
in
the
court
of
claims.
they
weren't
made
in
the
brief
submitted
in
opposition
of
petition
for
certiorari.
they
first
appear
here.
one
of
them
is
that
the
date
on
which
the
value
of
the
husband's
marital
obligation
should
be
--
on
which
they
should
be
valued
is
that
--
is
the
november
1954
date
on
which
the
--
at
which
the
agreement
was
signed
and
not
the
march
1955
date
when
the
property
was
transferred.
he
says,
“if
you
take
the
november
1954
date,
you
will
find
that
at
that
time,
the
market
value
of
the
stock
was
below
his
basis.
and
there's
--
they
--
he
for
the
first
time
in
search
in
the
record
the
--
or
in
his
briefs
states
what
the
market
value
where
the
stock
in
november
1954
was
though
that
is
of
course
a
matter
of
--
that
one
can
find
out
by
looking
at
the
reports
of
the
stock
market,
and
we
do
not
dispute
the
value.
but
the
reason
i
mentioned
that
is
to
show
how
this
is
the
first
time
that
it
comes
into
the
case.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
parties
to
make
their
adjustment
of
values
at
the
time
of
the
transfer
in
march
when
there
was
an
accretion
in
value
and
appreciation
in
value
in
the
husband's
stock,
not
the
date
of
the
agreement.
and
this
was
the
date
that
was
also
taken
in
the
mesta
and
halliwell
cases.
it
was
the
date
of
the
transfer.
no
issue
was
raised
in
those
cases
on
that
point
but
the
court
took
the
date
of
the
transfer
in
agreements
often
the
date
of
the
transfers
what
counts.
you
may
have
a
stock
of
a
corporation,
a
close
corporation
exchanged
for
marketable
stock,
an
agreement
to
that
effect
and
the
agreement
provides
in
several
months
later,
the
exchange
shall
be
made.
and
it's
necessary
to
have
stockholder's
consents
and
director's
consents
in
many
other
formalities.
and
the
parties
always
expect
that
the
exchange
of
values
when
the
close
corporation
stock
may
not
be
possible
to
value
at
all,
except
in
relation
to
the
market
value,
the
exchange
and
always
the
time
of
transfer
is
taken.
another
point
that
he
makes
is
that
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes,
your
honor.
it
said
april
1,
1955
for
500
shares,
april
1,
1956
for
500
shares.
and
in
that
connection,
he
makes
a
second
point
which
is
that
the
consideration
was
not
received.
that
is
a
consideration
of
discharge
as
marital
rights
was
not
received
by
the
husband
till
1956
when
the
whole
thousand
shares
was
delivered
or
perhaps
1964
when
the
alimony
payments
where
to
be
made.
but
we
say
that
our
--
it's
our
position
that
--
and
this
is
also
a
point
that
he
first
makes
here,
it's
our
position
that
consideration
was
received
pro-rata.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
i
think
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
i
thnk
it
would,
because
she
would
own
half
of
the
property.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
true
division.
and
i
--
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
findings
there
and
the
agreement
itself
that
this
property
was
owned
entirely
by
him.
i
can't
begin
--
i
don't
think
anything
fair
question
about
it.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
that
is
true
in
many
other
respects.
