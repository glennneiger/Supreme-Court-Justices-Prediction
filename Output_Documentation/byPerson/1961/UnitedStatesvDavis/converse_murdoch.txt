mr.
converse
murdoch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
kutz
in
his
argument
quoted
the
statutory
provision
which
bears
on
this
matter
of
the
realization
of
gain
by
husband
in
connection
with
the
transfer
property
to
his
wife.
and
the
risk
of
repetition,
i
like
to
restate
those
statutory
provisions
because
i
think
they're
all
important
in
this
case.
section
1001
of
the
code
provides
that
gain
from
the
sale
or
other
disposition
of
the
property
shall
be
the
excess
of
amount
realized
there
from
over
the
adjusted
basis
for
the
property.
statute
goes
on
to
provide
that
the
amount
realized
from
the
sale
or
other
disposition
of
property
shall
be
the
sum
of
any
money
received
plus
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
other
than
money
received.
on
a
statutory
conglomeration
such
as
the
internal
revenue
code
which
is
replete
with
complex
provisions
i
point
this
out
as
a
provision
which
is
remarkably
simple
and
clear.
i
can
understand
this
provision.
there
seems
to
be
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
the
transaction
by
which
mr.
davis
transferred
property
to
his
wife
is
du
pont
stock
would
not,
under
common
understanding
of
the
word,
be
considered
a
sale.
also
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
question
about
the
proposition
that
what
mr.
davis
received
in
exchange
for
this
du
pont
stock
was
not
money.
and
that
means
if
there
are
only
two
inquiries
here
which
most
of
which
must
be
answered
affirmatively
before
the
court
of
claims
can
be
reverse
on
this
point.
and
those
two
inquires
are
these.
first,
was
mr.
davis'
transfer
of
du
pont
stock
to
his
wife
a
disposition,
as
that
word
use
in
the
statute?
and
secondly,
assuming
an
affirmative
answer
to
the
first
was
the
fair
market
value
of
what
mr.
davis
received
an
amount
in
excess
of
his
basis
for
the
property
he
transferred.
now,
i
submit
that
either
of
those
questions
must
be
answered
in
the
negative
then
the
court
of
claims
must
be
affirmed
on
this
point,
otherwise,
the
statutory
provision
hasn't
been
met.
now,
the
word
“disposition”
in
the
statute
has
never
been
construed
to
encompass
all
transfers.
it's
obviously
possible
to
read
it
--
it's
meaning
any
transfer
is
a
disposition.
now,
the
government
itself
conceives
in
its
brief
that
there
are
many
types
of
transfers
which
do
not
constitute
taxable
dispositions
and
the
government's
quite
candid
in
pointing
out
this
analo
--
somewhat
analogous
situations.
example
of
those
would
be
transfers
in
connections
with
division
of
partnership
property
or
transfers
in
connection
with
distributions
of
shares
of
estates
or
trust
transfers
in
connection
with
in
kind
corporate
distributions
to
stockholders,
transfers
in
connection
with
marital
separations
of
couples
residing
in
community
property
states.
further,
the
government
has
never
contended
so
far
as
i
can
determine
that
there
is
any
taxable
disposition
for
purposes
of
the
internal
revenue
laws
in
such
common
place
transfers
as
gifts
or
transfers
of
appreciated
property
to
a
charitable
organization
or
a
transformation
of
property
from
a
descendant
to
his
heirs.
since
not
all
dispositions,
not
all
transfers
rather,
qualify
as
taxable
dispositions,
it
must
be
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
word
“disposition”
has
a
narrower
meaning
than
the
word
“transfer”
for
purpose
of
the
statute.
i
submit
that
the
most
satisfac
--
mr.
converse
murdoch
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
submit
that
to
make
sense
out
of
the
statute,
we
have
to
accept
the
definition
of
disposition
which
seems
to
be
either
implicitly
or
explicitly
assumed
by
everyone
who
has
handled
cases
in
this
area
and
that
is
the
somewhat
art
--
inartistic
definition
of
disposition
as
meaning
a
transfer
like
a
sale.
using
that
definition
of
disposition,
we
come
to
this
inquiry
in
this
particular
case
and
that
is
was
mr.
davis'
transfer
of
du
pont
stock
to
his
wife
a
part
of
a
transaction
which
was
like
a
sale.
now,
the
government
has
done
a
good
job
in
its
brief
of
narrowing
the
issue
down
considerably
in
this
case
and
it's
done
it
by
making
a
very
candid
concession.
the
government
said
in
its
original
brief
that
as
an
original
matter,
this
inquiry
could
have
been
answered
either
way
that
indicates
if
the
government
believes
that
if
this
was
a
new
issue,
an
answer
either
way
would
be
reasonable
and
if
you
were
the
government.
i'm
not
ready
to
make
a
light
concession
but
i'm
ready
to
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
the
government
meant
what
they
said
in
that
concession.
the
government
then
goes
on
from
that
concession
and
analyzed
a
certain
considerations
which
had
asked
the
court
to
take
into
account
in
deciding
this
case
and
concludes
here
i'm
quoting,
“other
considerations
being
inconclusive,
the
factor
which
should
be
determined
have
been
favor
reversing
the
court
of
claims
is
the
force
of
precedent.”
now,
the
government
submits
two
principle
circuit
court
decisions
as
exerting
this
force
of
precedent
in
its
direction.
those
are
the
mesta
and
the
halliwell
cases.
now,
since
these
are
the
principle
cases
in
which
the
government
relies
for
the
one
factor
which
it
says
--
(inaudible)
this
case
towards
its
side.
i
think
it's
worth
analyzing
those
cases
in
some
detail.
in
mesta,
the
husband
taxpayer
agreed
to
deliver
stock
to
his
wife
and
i'm
quoting,
“in
full
settlement
and
satisfaction
of
all
claims
and
demands
on
the
part
of
mrs.
mesta
for
her
maintenance
and
support”.
now,
it's
true
that
the
agreement
also
resided
that
the
transfer
was
in
lieu
of
all
marital
rights
of
the
wife
and
the
husband's
property.
the
board
of
tax
appeals
decided
that
the
husband
did
not
realize
a
taxable
gain
on
account
of
his
transfer
of
stock
to
his
wife.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
disposition
but
in
its
opinion
noted
only
that
the
transfer
was
in
settlement
and
satisfaction
of
the
wife's
claim
for
alimony
and
support.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
board
of
tax
appeals
in
its
opinion
stated
that
the
government's
argument
in
mesta
was
on
the
basis
that
the
transfer
was
in
discharge
of
the
husband's
support
obligation.
in
halliwell
case,
the
parties
attached
to
their
separation
agreement
a
schedule
listing
certain
securities
where
agreed
values
attributed
to
each
and
a
cash
adjustment
figure
to
bring
the
total
of
the
property
transferred
to
the
wife,
the
$462,561.
this
indicates
to
me
that
the
parties
in
the
halliwell
case
had
arrived
in
an
understanding
that
the
husband
would
transfer
a
specific
dollar
amount
to
the
wife
and
then
had
set
about
finding
securities
which
the
husband
could
transfer
to
her
in
satisfaction
of
that
specific
amount.
as
in
the
mesta
case,
the
court
of
appeals
would
reverse
the
board
of
tax
appeals
and
help
for
the
government
noted
in
its
opinion
that
the
transfer
was
in
discharge
of
a
support
obligation
and
also
in
discharge
of
the
husband's
obligations
to
support
a
child.
in
the
halliwell
case,
it's
true
as
the
government
points
out
that
the
wife
also
executed
a
release
of
her
rights
to
share
in
her
husband's
estate.
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
halliwell
did
not
refer
to
this
as
a
consideration
for
the
transfer
of
the
securities.
again,
as
in
the
mesta
case,
the
agreement
did
not
refer
to
the
transfer
as
being
a
part
of
a
division
of
property.
now,
those
are
the
two
cases,
which
the
government
says
are
precedence
for
deciding
the
t.c.
davis
case
on
the
basis
of
holding
that
he
realized
gain.
in
the
davis
case,
the
agreement
which
is
set
forth
in
full
in
the
record
is
quite
explicit
to
the
effect
of
the
transfer
of
stock
was
part
of
a
division
of
property.
entirely
separate
provisions
were
made
in
the
agreement
for
satisfaction
of
mr.
davis'
obligation
to
support
his
wife
and
his
minor
child.
for
that
reason,
we
submit
that
the
mesta
and
halliwell
cases,
both
of
which
involve
transfers
and
discharge
of
a
support
obligation,
are
not
at
all
in
point
for
the
davis
case
which
involved
a
transfer
and
division
of
property
and
the
agreement
is
clear
on
that.
mr.
converse
murdoch
yes,
your
honor.
i
appreciate
that
(inaudible).
mr.
converse
murdoch
i'll
spell
that
out
for
you,
your
honor.
the
du
pont
stock,
which
was
transferred
to
mrs.
davis
in
this
case,
was
clearly
prop
--
property
which
was
titled
in
mr.
davis'
name.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
the
stock
on
the
books
of
the
du
pont
company
is
registered
in
the
name
of
t.c.
davis.
but
the
point
of
this
is
that
there
was
another
property
involved
in
this
agreement,
other
properties
besides
from
the
du
pont
stock.
the
agreement
points
out
that
the
wife
among
other
things
agreed
to
transfer
to
the
husband
certain
insurance
policies
on
his
life.
i'm
not
contending
that
the
du
pont
stock
is
jointly
owned.
i'm
saying
that
it
was
part.
its
transfer
was
part
of
an
overall
division
of
the
property
of
the
parties.
these
include
their
household
furnishing,
other
insurance
policies,
the
residence
in
they
live.
all
that
have
to
be
straightened
out
and
that's
what
they
did.
and
as
a
part
of
that,
the
husband
transferred
du
pont
stock
to
his
wife.
then
entirely
as
part
from
that
and
another
part
of
the
agreement,
they
made
provision
for
the
discharge
of
the
support
and
alimony
obligation
of
the
husband.
mr.
kutz
in
his
argument
said
that
there
was
--
there
would
have
to
be
evidence
in
the
record
in
cases
of
this
sort
as
to
the
value
of
the
wife's
right
to
support
an
alimony
and
if
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
kind
in
this
case
other
than
the
evidence
of
the
value
of
the
stock
of
the
du
pont
company
and
i
submit
that
the
agreement
itself
furnishes
evidence
of
what
the
parties
had
agreed
was
the
consideration
and
therefore
apparently,
the
value
in
the
government's
view
of
this
support,
an
alimony
obligation.
now,
the
government
in
its
brief
points
to
paragraph
13
of
the
agreement
and
that
appears
on
page
97
of
the
record
and
says
that
that
paragraph
indicates
as
the
government
puts
it
that
a
division
of
property
as
a
legal
misnomer
in
this
case.
i
think
what
they're
trying
to
say
is,
and
they're
sparing
my
fillings
apparently
by
putting
in
terms
of
a
legal
misnomer,
they're
trying
to
say
that
they
don't
believe
this
that
this
was
in
fact
a
division
of
property
but
certainly
paragraph
13
does
not
support
the
argument
that
this
was
not
a
division
of
property
because
all
paragraph
13
does
is
to
wrap
up
the
whole
agreement
and
have
both
sides
agree
that
the
whole
agreement
is
to
be
a
final
combination
of
their
respect
of
obligations
to
each
other
as
to
alimony
or
support
or
any
property
interest
they
had.
now,
there's
an
important
issue
of
the
facts
in
this
case
which
is
raised
in
the
government's
reply
brief
but
not
in
its
main
brief.
in
the
government's
main
brief
they
state
that
all
of
the
property
involve
in
the
settlement
negotiations
were
owned
by
mr.
davis
and
that's
an
accurate
statement
and
that's
what
the
court
of
claims
found.
in
the
replied
brief,
the
government
says
that
all
of
the
property
involved
in
the
agreement
was
owned
by
mr.
davis
and
that
is
not
what
the
court
of
claims
found.
and
to
appreciate
the
difference
in
those
words,
the
court
must
remember
that
in
the
court
of
claims,
we
were
also
arguing
about
the
deduction
of
counsel
fees
to
protect
mr.
davis'
interest
in
the
du
pont
company
and
that
it
was
page
after
page
of
testimony
about
the
lawyer's
negotiating
with
respect
to
this
du
pont
stock,
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
court
of
claims
noted
that
the
du
pont
stock
was
owned
by
mr.
davis
and
that
was
the
subject
of
the
negotiations.
but
the
record
itself
shows
that
there
was
other
property
involved
in
the
agreement.
now,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
if
there's
any
force
of
precedent
work
in
this
case,
it's
a
work
on
the
side
of
the
taxpayer.
we
submit
that
the
cases
involving
situations
varying
a
very
close
analogy
to
the
davis
case
have
been
uniformly
decided
by
determinations
that
the
transfers
do
not
constitute
taxable
dispositions.
i've
already
mentioned
some
of
those
are
distributions
of
shares
of
estate
or
trust,
those
are
not
considered
taxable
dispositions.
mr.
converse
murdoch
no,
your
honor.
not
the
dispositions
--
mr.
converse
murdoch
not
testamentary.
i'm
talking
about
an
estate
or
trust
distribution
of
property
to
an
heir
where
it's
in
satisfaction
of
an
heir's
right
to
a
share
in
the
estate
or
in
the
trust.
i'm
not
talking
about
transmission
from
the
living
to
dead.
i'm
talking
about
the
fiduciaries
transfer.
in
that
situation,
there's
no
statutory
provision
that
covers
this,
nonetheless,
as
a
matter
of
such
thing
as
tax
common-law,
a
tax
common-law.
there
is
no
taxable
disposition
found
in
that
situation,
neither
is
there
a
taxable
disposition
on
division
of
partnership
property.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
business
partnership
breaks
up
and
men
who
are
dealing
with
each
other
as
businessmen
and
decide
to
break
apart
and
conduct
their
businesses
separately,
if
they
have
no
gain
when
one
takes
one
part
of
their
partnership
property
and
another
one
takes
another
part
of
partnership
property,
i
failed
to
see
how
in
a
completely
non-business
transaction
such
as
a
marriage
and
a
divorce,
the
parties
can
have
a
taxable
gain
when
they
do
the
same
thing
that
a
business
partnership
does
without
any
realization
to
gain.
the
same
thing
is
true
in
breaking
up
a
corporate
relationship.
the
government
doesn't
contend
that
when
a
corporation
is
dissolved,
the
corporation
realizes
any
gain
when
it
transfers
the
property
of
the
corporations
in
kind,
in
liquidation
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
divisions
of
community
property.
the
government
seems
to
recognize
that
the
deci
--
decision
holding
mr.
davis
has
a
taxable
gain
here
would
create
a
divergence
of
tax
treatment
as
between
common-law
and
community
property
law
jurisdictions.
and
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
it
makes
still
attempt
to
say
that
that's
a
desirable
state
of
the
law.
the
government's
answer
seems
to
be
instead
that
if
there's
a
divergence
of
treatment,
this
is
a
matter
of
this
just
inherent
in
the
differences
between
community
property
and
common-law
property
jurisdictions.
the
government
also
suggests
that
if
there's
to
be
a
cure
for
this
divergence,
the
cure
should
come
from
congress
and
not
from
this
court.
if
i
was
arguing
here
today
in
the
face
of
a
statute
which
said
that
there
must
be
a
gain
in
the
situation
such
as
mr.
davis'
or
if
there
were
precedents
in
this
court
which
required
that
result
then
i
would
think
that
the
government's
answer
on
this
community
property
problem
would
be
worthy
of
consideration.
in
that
case
obviously,
the
jury
relies
with
congress.
but
in
this
case,
the
government
itself
concedes
that
the
court
could
reasonably
decide
this
as
an
original
proposition
either
way.
and
i
submit
that
if
that
is
the
fact,
the
court
could
decide
either
way
then
its
wise
policy
to
decide
this
case
on
a
basis
which
would
give
us
a
uniform
system
of
taxation
rather
than
a
divergence
system
of
taxation.
mr.
converse
murdoch
under
my
view
--
mr.
converse
murdoch
the
only
views
i
have
right
at
the
moment
your
honor
--
mr.
converse
murdoch
--
part
that
mr.
davis
shouldn't
pay
a
tax
on
this
type
--
mr.
converse
murdoch
--
of
transaction.
mr.
converse
murdoch
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
should
be
the
law
if
the
husband
is
not
to
pay
a
tax
then
the
wife
should
pay
the
tax
when
if
ever
she
sells
--
mr.
converse
murdoch
--
the
property
--
mr.
converse
murdoch
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
converse
murdoch
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
converse
murdoch
now,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
this
matter
of
the
proper
measure
of
the
taxpayer's
gain
and
the
proper
year
in
which
the
tax
is
gained.
now,
i've
assumed
so
far
in
my
argument
that
mesta
and
halliwell
are
first
not
applicable
here
because
they
involved
transfers
and
discharge
of
a
support
obligation
whereas
mr.
davis'
transfer
was
part
of
a
division
of
property.
that
i'm
not
ready
at
this
point
to
assume
that
mesta
and
halliwell
do
apply
in
this
case
and
that
their
reasoning
applies
and
that
means
if
you
accept
the
reasoning
of
mesta
and
halliwell,
you
must
conclude
that
the
husband
engaged
in
a
taxable
transaction
and
then
moved
over
and
find
out
whether
he
had
a
gain
or
a
loss
on
the
transaction.
now,
on
mesta,
the
court
of
appeals
was
faced
with
the
problem
of
once
having
decided
if
there
was
taxable
disposition,
how
do
you
measure
the
amount
moving
to
the
husband.
obviously,
a
man
doesn't
buy
--
divesting
himself
for
property
alone
gain
income,
he
gains
income
by
having
something
moved
towards
him.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
mesta
met
that
problem
very
neatly
by
saying
that
they
would
assume
that
a
man
who
gives
property
of
a
fixed
value
must
be
getting
his
money's
worth.
well,
that's
a
very
broad
assumption
particularly
in
marital
situations.
but
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
that
is
the
correct
way
to
analyze
this
and
that
that
is
the
correct
way
to
measure
the
gain
moving
to
the
husband.
now,
if
that's
the
fact
then
we
must
assume
that
when
mr.
davis
negotiated
with
mrs.davis,
he
placed
a
value
on
the
rights
which
were
going
to
move
to
him.
and
he
placed,
using
the
mesta
reasoning
again,
he
placed
the
value
of
exactly
the
same
dollar
amount
as
the
value
of
what
he
was
going
to
transfer
to
her.
now,
mr.
davis
even
though
he
was
the
vice
president
of
the
du
pont
company
in
1954
didn't,
so
far
as
i
know
and
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
know
in
november
of
1954
what
is
going
to
be
the
value
of
the
du
pont
stock
in
march
of
1955.
so
we
can
assume
that
if
mesta
is
right
that
the
husband
got
his
money's
worth
and
was
negotiating
in
terms
of
what
the
value
was
or
what
he
was
going
to
transfer,
he
must
have
been
reasoning
in
terms
of
the
value
on
the
date
he
made
the
agreements.
and
the
court,
i
believe,
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
stock
quotations
in
the
wall
street
journal
that
day
and
the
value
of
the
du
pont
stock
that
mr.
davis
transferred
on
that
date
had
a
basis,
had
a
--
was
less
than
mr.
davis'
basis
for
the
stock.
now,
the
government
answers
these
arguments
about
the
wrong
value
and
the
wrong
year
without
seem
to
meet
them
head-on.
the
first
answer
the
government
gave
in
its
replied
brief
as
to
why
the
date
of
agreement
value
would
not
work
was
to
say
that
using
that
date
as
the
critical
date
for
fixing
value
would
result
in
a
rule
which
would
be
difficult
to
please.
now,
i
construe
that
argument
in
saying
no
more
than
if
you
take
mesta
and
apply
it
reasonably
and
logically,
you
reach
a
point
where
it's
difficult
to
hold.
therefore,
you
take
mesta,
you
adopt
its
rule
but
you
don't
apply
its
reasoning
logically
to
the
conclusion
to
which
it
obviously
points,
you'll
apply
it
in
a
new
logical
and
unreasonable
way
so
as
to
reach
the
result
which
is
easy
to
please.
the
government's
second
argument
about
the
wrong
value
and
wrong
year
matter
is
to
state
that
in
mesta
and
halliwell,
the
date
of
delivery
value
rather
the
date
of
agreement
value
was
used.
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals
in
mesta
shows
that
the
so-called
“value”
used
to
determine
the
gain
was
merely
a
figure
agreed
upon
by
the
husband
and
wife
as
part
of
the
negotiations.also
in
that
case,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
transfer
actually
occurred
only
four
days
after
the
date
in
the
agreement.
on
halliwell
case,
the
values
used
for
measuring
the
gain
are
later
recited
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
been
the
date
of
delivery
values
which
was
july
16,
1938
where
in
fact
the
values
described
in
the
securities
by
the
parties
in
an
agreement
executed
on
march
16,
1938.
the
date
of
delivery
in
the
halliwell
case
was
just
four
months
after
the
agreement
date.
in
halliwell,
the
transfer
securities
consisted
of
stock
of
ten
corporations.
when
it's
noted
that
eight
of
those
stocks
were
publicly
traded,
it
passes
my
understanding
how
on
july
16,
1938,
those
stocks
can
have
a
value,
a
fair
market
value
to
the
penny
equal
to
their
value
on
march
16,
1938
when
the
parties
signed
the
agreement.
government's
next
answer
to
this
major
value
question
is
to
state
that
the
commissioner's
use
of
the
date
of
delivery
was
not
contested
by
the
taxpayers
in
the
court
of
claims.
that's
quite
correct.
that
we
contend
that
where
we
have
objected
to
the
fundamental
error
of
the
commissioner,
namely
the
error
of
saying
that
we
had
a
taxable
disposition
here,
it's
not
necessary
for
us
to
object
to
every
subsidiary
error
which
is
associated
with
that
principle
errors.
mr.
converse
murdoch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
converse
murdoch
in
my
opinion
as
the
respondent,
we
are
entitled
to
have
the
decision
of
the
court
below
affirmed
if
there
is
any
ground
which
supports
it,
whether
or
not
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
below.
the
last
answer
the
government
has
about
this
major
value
question
is
to
analogize
to
the
situation
where
a
person
takes
property
with
a
known
value,
we'll
assume
it's
known
because
it's
stock
of
a
listed
corporation
where
you
can
check
the
newspaper
quotations
and
exchanges
that
for
stock
of
a
corporation
in
which
is
difficult
to
determine
the
market
value.
let's
assume
for
cycle
illustration
that
the
stock
we're
talking
about
is
a
million
dollars
worth
of
du
pont
stock
which
is
transferred
by
a
du
pont
stockholder
to
the
xyz
corporation
in
a
taxable
transaction
and
the
du
pont
stockholder
gets
back
all
of
the
stock
of
the
xyz
corporation.
now,
the
first
place
of
this
analogy
falls
down
is
that
in
that
situation,
we're
not
talking
about
taxing
the
transferor
on
the
value
of
a
release
of
rights
in
the
du
pont
stock
he
transferred.
we're
talking
about
the
tax
on
the
transferor
by
virtue
of
receiving
stock
of
the
xyz
corporation.
on
that
situation,
it
seems
to
me
it's
perfectly
reasonable
to
say
that
in
the
absence
of
any
better
evidence
of
value,
the
stock
of
the
xyz
corporation
on
the
date
when
the
man
transfers
the
du
pont
stock
to
it,
you
can
assume
that
the
value
of
the
xyz
company
is
the
value
of
the
underlying
asset,
the
du
pont
stock,
and
that's
perfectly
reasonable.
but
that
doesn't
happen
to
be
the
case
in
marital
settlements.
after
mr.
davis
transferred
a
stock
of
the
du
pont
company
to
mrs.
davis,
he
didn't
retain
an
interest
in
that
stock
through
her.
he
had
no
interest
at
all
in
the
stock
after
he
had
once
transferred
it
to
her
and
let
the
worst
had
gone
through.
therefore,
it's
entirely
unlike
the
situation
when
you
transfer
something
and
retain
an
indirect
interest
in
it.
i
think
it's
somewhat
ironic
--
mr.
converse
murdoch
i
just
think
that
is
not
an
answer.
the
answer
of
--
that
i've
been
reciting
was
the
government's
answer
to
why
you
value
on
the
date
of
delivery
and
you
use
the
value
of
the
date
of
the
property
transfer
as
the
measure.
i'm
suggesting
the
analogy
proposed
for
the
government
is
not
apt
in
a
marital
situation.
mr.
converse
murdoch
yes,
your
honor.
the
agreement
was
the
time
--
it
was
done
at
the
time
when
--
if
the
parties
thought
about
this
and
valued
it,
they
then
knew
the
value
of
the
du
--
mr.
converse
murdoch
--
pont
stock
and
if
they
were
going
to
attribute
to
them
bargaining
about
the
value
of
the
wife's
right,
that's
the
date
they
must
have
valued.
mr.
converse
murdoch
yes,
your
honor.
i
appreciate
that
but
i
think
that
is
inconsistent
with
saying
that
the
parties
actually
thought
there
was
an
agreement.
that
is
more
consistent
with
the
proposition
of
the
parties
didn't
think
there
was
consideration
moving
her
husband
at
all.
they
agreed
that
she
would
get
certain
property
which
he
owned
as
part
of
a
breakup
for
their
property
which
is
in
kind
type
of
distribution
is
using,
not
in
discharge
of
a
fixed
obligation.
the
first
court
which
considered
this
problem
was
the
board
of
tax
appeals
and
then
the
mesta
case,
which
that
board
of
tax
appeals
decided
for
the
taxpayer.
in
commenting
on
this
valuation
and
the
consideration
problem,
the
board
said
that
the
value
agreed
upon
by
the
husband
and
the
wife
is
not
controlling.
it's
doubtful
as
the
respondent,
meaning
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
would
so
contend
if
her
venture
petitioner
were
claiming
a
loss.
the
board
of
tax
appeals
in
my
view
was
being
prophetic
when
they
said
that
and
they
were
prophesying
the
davis
case.
on
both
mesta
and
halliwell,
the
date
of
agreement
and
the
date
of
transfer
and
the
date
of
release
of
the
wife's
rights
all
occurred
within
one
taxable
year
in
each
case.
here,
unlike
that
situation,
the
agreement
was
executed
in
1954.
the
first
transfer
of
the
du
pont
stock
occurred
in
1955
and
the
second
half
of
the
stock
was
transferred
in
1956.
and
the
husband
has
still
not
fully
performed
all
of
his
obligations
under
this
agreement.
i
think
with
that
state
of
facts,
it's
perfectly
reasonable
to
argue
that
mrs.
davis
released
her
rights
against
mr.
davis
and
that
is
the
consideration
the
government
says
makes
it
a
taxable
event.
it's
perfectly
possible
to
argue
that
that
event
occurred
in
1954
when
mrs.
davis
signed
the
agreement.
it's
also
reasonable
to
argue
that
she
still
hasn't
released
her
rights
and
won't
until
all
of
mr.
davis'
obligations
under
the
agreement
have
been
met
and
that
one
occur
until
1964.
however,
i
cannot
believe
that
it's
reasonable
to
argue
that
the
release
by
mrs.
davis
occurred
in
march
of
1955
when
the
most
essential
parts
of
the
agreement
were
still
not
carried
out.
i
suggested
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
that
there
were
two
inquiries
for
which
there
must
be
affirmative
answers
before
the
court
of
claims
should
be
reversed.
the
first
was
whether
mr.
davis
had
made
a
--
a
transfer
which
is
a
disposition
within
the
meaning
of
section
1001.
and
the
second
is
whether
the
fair
market
value
of
consideration
moving
to
mr.
davis
exceeded
his
basis
for
the
property.
i
submit
that
both
of
those
questions
must
be
answered
in
the
negative.
however,
i
submit
that
even
if
both
of
them
are
answered
affirmatively,
the
government
has
still
picked
the
wrong
year
and
has
picked
the
wrong
measure
of
gain
with
which
to
tax
mr.
davis.
therefore,
even
if
both
questions
are
answered
in
the
negative,
i
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
should
be
affirmed
on
this
point.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
now
to
the
tax
counsel
fee
issue.
in
the
court
of
claims,
we
were
litigating
about
two
tax
counsel
fees.
there
were
other
fees
about
which
we
were
litigating
but
they
are
not
here
before
this
court.
in
the
court
of
claims,
we
had
two
tax
counsel
fees
involved.
one
was
the
tax
counsel
fee,
which
mr.
davis
pays
to
his
own
attorney.
the
other
was
the
tax
counsel
fee
which
mr.
davis
paid
to
the
attorney
who
represented
his
wife.
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
government
disapproved
and
fought
the
deduction
of
both
tax
counsel
fees.
now,
this
phase
of
the
case
seems
to
me
that
posed
purely
an
issue
of
statutory
construction.
and
on
the
statutory
construction
issue,
the
court
of
claims
rejected
the
government's
contention
that
section
212
(3)
only
applied
to
fees
for
contested
tax
matters.
however,
the
court
of
claims,
while
rejecting
that
interpretation
of
the
statute,
held
that
mr.
davis
was
not
entitled
to
a
deduction
for
his
wife's
tax
counsel
fees
but
that
decision
was
solely
on
the
basis
that
they
believe
that
the
fees
being
to
the
wife's
counsel
rather
than
to
the
payor's
counsel,
they
were
not
deductible
under
the
statute.
now,
the
government
didn't
petition
for
certiorari
with
respect
to
this
broader
issue
which
was
involved
in
the
deduction
of
the
husband's
tax
counsel
fees
paid
it
with
his
own
counsel.
and
our
petition
was
solely
with
respect
to
this
matter
of
the
deduction
of
the
tax
counsel
fees
paid
to
the
wife's
attorney.
now,
the
government
pictures
its
principle
argument
on
the
statutory
construction
in
terms
of
legislative
history.
and
at
points
the
two
fragments
of
legislative
history
which
it
believes
support
the
proposition
that
only
fees
were
computing
or
contesting
taxes
or
deductible
under
section
212
(3).
the
first
is
the
statement
in
the
committee
reports
of
congress
in
connection
with
the
1954
code
which
referred
to
deductions
for
contested
tax
matters.
i
think
the
government's
argument
has
brought
out
the
relationship
between
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
lykes
case
and
the
congressional
action
in
1954
in
inserting
section
212
(3).
and
with
that
background
as
to
why
congress
enacted
section
212
(3),
it's
obvious
to
me
why
in
the
committee
reports,
in
discussing
this
new
provision,
they've
mentioned
only
by
way
of
exemplification
in
my
view,
the
matter
of
contested
tax
matters.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
in
lykes,
this
court
was
dealing
with
a
contested
gift
tax
liability.
so
it's
quite
natural
for
the
draftsman
of
the
committee
report
having
in
mind
the
lykes'
decision
to
mention
that
as
an
example
of
the
type
of
deduction
which
would
now
be
a
liable
under
section
212
(3).
but
certainly,
i
can't
believe
that
the
committee
report
was
intended
to
limit
deductions
under
section
212
(3)
to
just
the
matter
which
is
exemplified
in
this
committee
report.
and
the
treasury
its
own
regulations
has
conceded
this
because
it
has
gone
far
beyond
what
it
claims
the
committee
report
group
in
describing
this
--
type
of
fees
which
can
be
deducted.
now,
the
second
bill
of
legislative
history
which
the
government
brings
in
to
this
phase
of
the
case
is
a
very
short
excerpt
from
a
written
statement
from
the
aba
tax
section
which
was
submitted
to
the
senate
finance
committee
after
a
hearing
for
the
senate
finance
committee
and
that
comment
of
the
aba
tax
section
is
really
a
comment
about
the
house
committee
report
rather
than
a
comment
about
the
statutory
language.
that
statement
of
the
aba
states
that
the
problem
is
not
raised
by
the
statute.
the
problem
was
raised
by
the
house
committee
report
and
it
recommends
doing
something
about
the
committee
report.
now,
it
strikes
me
if
we're
to
bring
in
that
type
of
legislative
history
where
then
embarked
on
a
new
course
--
search
for
legislative
history,
we're
now
looking
for
history
of
legislative
history
rather
than
the
history
of
legislation.
and
in
our
brief,
we've
cited
cases
to
show
that
in
analyzing
legislative
history
even
the
statements
of
members
of
congress
on
the
floor
are
not
admissible
for
purposes
of
showing
congressional
intent.
and
if
that
so,
i
can't
see
how
we
can
now
consider
statements
in
a
written,
long
written
document
submitted
to
a
congressional
committee
after
a
hearing
which
for
all
we
know
is
never
read
by
anyone
in
congress.
now,
presenting
ambiguity
section
212
(3),
i
submit
that
that
ambiguity
is
completely
dispelled
by
the
treasury
regulations
which
unequivocally
provide
for
the
deduction
of
tax
counsel
fees.
that
regulation
provides,
and
here
i'm
reading,
this
is
on
page
25
of
the
taxpayer's
brief,
for
the
deduction
of
expenses
paid
or
incurred
by
a
taxpayer
for
a
tax
counsel
or
expenses
paid
or
incurred
in
connection
with
the
preparation
of
his
tax
returns
or
in
connection
with
any
proceedings
involved
in
determining.
now,
if
the
government's
statement
of
this
rule
is
correct
then
this
regulation
adds
unnecessary
words
in
it.
it
should
have
said
expenses
paid
or
incurred
by
a
taxpayer
for
tax
counsel
in
connection
with
the
preparation
of
his
tax
returns.
obviously,
they
thought
that
tax
counsel
fees
could
be
unrelated
to
these
enumerated
things
which
follow
on
the
regulation.
in
trust
of
bingham,
this
court
approved
a
deduction
of
fees
paid
by
a
trustee
for
tax
advice
in
connection
with
problems
arising
in
connection
with
the
distribution
of
a
trust
estate.
and
that
was
before
the
1954
code.
now,
it
seems
obvious
to
me
that
in
1954,
congress
thought
when
they
enacted
section
212
(3),
they
were
introducing
a
liberalizing
provision
of
the
law,
which
the
effect
of
which
would
be
to
change
the
rule
of
the
lykes'
decision.
i
can't
believe
that
congress
thought
that
in
enacting
section
212
(3),
they
were
going
to
limit
the
broad
category
of
deductions
which
had
therefore
been
allowed.
now,
the
narrow
ground
on
which
the
court
of
claims
decided
this
tax
counsel
fee
issue
was
on
the
ground
that
the
counsel
fee
was
paid
by
mr.
davis,
not
to
the
attorney
represented
him,
but
to
the
attorney
who
represented
the
wife.
and
i
believe
to
understand
why
the
taxpayers
believed
that
that's
immaterial
for
purposes
of
this
statute.
it's
necessary
to
understand
that
in
delaware
as
in
most
states,
counsel
fees
incurred
by
a
wife
are
considered
necessaries
for
which
the
husband
is
obligated
to
pay
just
as
he's
obligated
to
pay
for
groceries
for
the
wife.
once
it's
determined
that
the
tax
counsel
fees
in
this
case
are
deductible
by
virtue
of
their
nature
regardless
of
who
they're
paid
to
and
that
i
think
the
treasury
regulations
made
clear
then
i
see
no
reason
in
the
statute
or
in
legislative
history
or
in
any
policy
consideration
for
denying
mr.
davis
a
deduction
for
those
fees
merely
because
they
were
paid
under
his
legal
duty
to
pay
them
imposed
on
them
by
state
law
merely
because
they're
paid
by
him
to
the
attorney
who
represented
his
wife.
thank
you.
