(inaudible)
at
that
time
mr
ginsburg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
mr.
ginsburg?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
on
what
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
well,
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ginsburg
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
under
this
prior
law
that
was
interpreted
in
graham
versus
west
virginian,
was
it
compulsory
upon
the
district
attorney
to
file
those
charges
as
it
is
--
you
say
it
is
here
or
was
that
discretionary?
i
don't
believe
it
says,
it
doesn't
refer
to
that
in
the
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this
question
also
please?
under
the
previous
statute,
has
the
supreme
court
said
what
defenses
were
opened
to
him
when
such
a
charge
or
was
he
there
under
that
statute
limited
only
to
identity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understood
to
you
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ginsburg
before
--
before
you
go
to
another
matter,
in
answer
to
justice
harlan,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
would
be
satisfied
for
your
petitioner
if
he
had
10
days
notice
and
if
he
had
an
opportunity
to
withdraw
his
plea.
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
now,
i
wonder
if
you
would
be
satisfied
if
you
are
limited
as
he
was
in
this
case
under
your
--
under
your
theory,
only
to
the
defense
of
identity.
would
you
not
still
--
would
you
not
still
insist
that
he
have
other
defenses
such
as
a
pardon
by
the
governor
or
this
other
fact
that
the
--
that
he
was
not
confined
in
a
penitentiary?
you
would
--
in
order
to
have
due
process
you
would
insist
that
he'd
be
entitled
to
all
those
defenses
would
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
exactly,
that's
--
that's
what
i
wanted
to
hear.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
the
sole
question
that
he
raised.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ginsburg,
we've
taken
much
of
your
time
asking
questions.
you
may
have
five
minutes
more
to
wish
to
respond
and
of
course,
mr.
mitchell
may
have
--
you
have
(inaudible)
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mitchell,
you
may
now
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mitchell
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
at
this
time
if
there
is
any
defense
open
to
the
defendant
on
habitual
criminal
charge
other
than
that
of
identity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
question
of
identity.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
question
of
identity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
a
man
--
suppose
the
man
says,
“yes”.
i
am
the
person
referred
to
in
this
information,
but
i
was
pardoned
by
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
because
he
found
i
was
innocent
and
my
--
my
other
conviction
was
voided
by
the
courts
because
they
found
that
it
was
--
i
was
unconstitutionally
convicted,
but
i
--
but
i
am
the
person
was
who
mentioned
in
that
information,”
can
he
raise
those
questions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
that
isn't
what
i'm
talking
about.
he
admits
that
he
is
the
person
referred
to
in
those
--
in
the
information.
does
that
end
his
defense
or
does
he
have
other
defenses
such
as
he
had
received
a
full
pardon
from
the
government
because
of
his
--
because
of
his
innocence
or
he
had
had
his
other
conviction
reversed
because
he
was
unconstitutionally
convicted?
can
he
raise
those
--
those
issues
if
he
admits
his
identity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now,
what
law
of
your
state
gives
it?
is
there
a
statute
concerning
that
or
is
that
interpretation
of
your
supreme
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
what
--
you
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
under
what
statute
do
you
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
--
how
frequently
has
that
been
done
in
practice
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
then
in
your
knowledge
have
in
mind
any
cases
where
it's
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
--
are
those
opinions
reported?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
are
no
opinions
reported
opinions
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
mitchell,
the
one
of
professors
of
law
school
made
to
rather
extensive
study
of
this
subject,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
did
he
comment
on
--
on
this
precise
question
that
justice
frankfurter
now
you're
discussing
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
go
in
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
okay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
recess
now
mr.
mitchell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
statute
(inaudible)
controversy
under
the
insinuation,
surely
he's
entitled
to
know
the
issue,
who
will
decide
it
under
the
facts
you
say
(inaudible)
--
making
sure
they
decide
that
question
or
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
recognized
and
i
suppose
in
addition
to
that,
the
range
of
decisions
that
you
say
can
be
raised
according
to
the
(inaudible)
by
the
highest
court.
suppose
it
was
an
issue
to
identity
and
he
raise
the
question
of
(inaudible)
in
the
statute
to
be
raised
only
before
a
jury
and
would
he
(inaudible)
be
limited
only
to
the
identity.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
in
fact
was
(inaudible)
is
whether
we
can
assume
that
the
wrong
in
west
virginia
is
that
a
man
in
this
situation,
(inaudible)
is
limited
to
the
question
of
identity.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
want
us
(inaudible)?
how
do
you
want
us
to
deal
with
your
law
of
west
virginia?
did
he
(inaudible)
to
contesting
identity
or
his
(inaudible)
in
some
matter
or
form
the
opportunity
raised
in
the
defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
talking
about
the
evidence
before
the
court
whether
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
mainly
proceeds
on
the
assumption
that
the
--
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
aren't
the
facts
that
you
rely
on
different
to
those
outlined
by
mr.
ginsburg?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
could
--
would
the
--
what
could
(inaudible)
if
a
man
said
yes,
i
am
the
person
but
those
convictions
have
been
wiped
out
(inaudible).
what
could
you
say
(inaudible)
a
continuance
as
long
this
wasn't
beyond
the
term.
what
would
you
then
--
what
could
be
the
continuance
assuming
the
--
if
he
finds
the
man
but
he
had
other
defenses
to
the
charge.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
could
i
also
get
back
to
the
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mitchell,
if
they
sentence
this
man
for
(inaudible)
and
file
this
information,
(inaudible)
and
if
he
does
not
do
so
in
90%
of
the
cases
that
is
(inaudible),
but
if
the
10%
of
the
cases
in
which
the
information
is
violative
after
the
(inaudible)
cases
where
the
man
said
he
was
not
guilty
and
in
fact
the
(inaudible)
guilty
were
so
charged
with
that
information.
would
you
not
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
the
facts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
yick
wo
is
not
also
those
who
claimed
he's
not
guilty
and
put
the
stake
the
(inaudible),
isn't
that
an
arbitrary
classification?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
--
assume
that
is
the
finding
and
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
--
if
it
did
--
if
the
record
did
show,
there
were
a
mass
of
cases
where
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
--
i
probably
have
in
mind
some
other
cases
we
have
in
west
virginia
where
that
(inaudible)
plead
not
guilty
but
the
fact
that
we
--
all
and
the
others
are
permitted
to
serve
their
clients
(inaudible)
charge
filed
against
them.
chief
justice

chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
require
the
district
attorney
to
file
the
information
(inaudible)
after
a
hearing
whether
the
man
is
to
be
treated
as
a
habitual
criminal
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
usually
decided
by
judge
and
not
by
a
district
attorney
who
filed
one
information
out
of
11
which
were
the
facts
(inaudible).
chief
justice
earl
warren

one
question
mr.
mitchell,

that
they

did
they
not?
chief

(inaudible)
chief

(inaudible)
you
say
that
your
supreme

will
look
at
the
pennsylvania
statute
and
determine
whether
the
crime
(inaudible)
it
was
one
punishable
by

--
it
was
considered
a
recidivist
in

that
what
--
chief

--
your
supreme
court
(inaudible)
-
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
