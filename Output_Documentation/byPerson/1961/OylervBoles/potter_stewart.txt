justice
potter
stewart
information
charged
simply
that
he'd
been
three
times
indicted?
justice
potter
stewart
and
convicted?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ginsburg,
had
the
petitioner
already
been
sentenced
for
--
for
this
second
degree
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
probably
the
sentencing
day
also
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
reason
the
defendant
was
there.
justice
potter
stewart
statutory
term.
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
you
say
with
the
sentence
raised,
first
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
had
lawyer
with
him.
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
the
first
distinction
was
the
contention
on
the
state
i
suppose
for
the
change
of
the
statute
that
is
the
--
in
--
and
the
statute
no
longer
requires
that
the
prior
offenses
be
set
out
in
the
indictment,
but
that
change
was
mitigating
change.
justice
potter
stewart
the
difficulty
is,
that
none
of
these
materials
was
in
the
record
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
--
mr.
ginsburg
before
you
sit
down,
i
have
two
questions,
first
of
all
on
this
matter
to
which
you've
just
been
addressing
yourself.
if
the
statute
instead
of
being
in
terms
mandatory
said
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
may
apply
to
this,
that
then
you
would
have
in
statutory
term
which
told
us
that
the
--
that
isn't
in
fact
the
practice
of
west
virginia.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
aren't
there
--
aren't
there
many
states
where
the
statute
is
permissive?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
more
--
more
usual,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
therefore,
this
practice
is
simple
in
conforming
in
practice
to
what
the
statutes
of
the
other
states
say,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
we're
faced
here
if
you're
right
as
to
this
practice
where
we
have
then
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
--
we
have
the
equivalent
of
--
of
a
statute
of
which
says
by
this
constitutional
question
goes
we
have
an
equivalent
of
the
statute
which
says
the
prosecutor
may
instead
of
must.
isn't
that
correct
to
the
constitutional
point
of
view?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
wondering
myself
mr.
ginsburg
on
your
earlier
point
if
i
may?
justice
potter
stewart
i
want
to
be
sure
mr.
ginsburg
before
you
sit
down
that
i
understand
what
it
is
that
these
people
now
assert
they
could
have
brought
before
the
sentencing
court?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
isn't
that
problem,
not
ambiguity
between
18
and
19
completely
resolved
by
this
skeen
case
or
the
keen
case
or
whatever
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
we
--
but
in
--
in
the
keen
case,
if
i
have
the
name
right,
keen
isn't
or
skeen?
justice
potter
stewart
skeen
case.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
(voice
overlap)
skeen.
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
on
that
basis
of
the
--
that
the
west
virginia
court
decided
it.
it
was
on
the
basis
that
18
was
controlling
overnight.
justice
potter
stewart
now
is
that
sole
issue
that
--
that
oyler
says
he
would
--
could
have
brought
before
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
about
crabtree?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
was
wondering
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
understanding
to
raise
those
if
they
not
so
that
they
were
prejudiced
here.
justice
potter
stewart
what
county
is
(inaudible)?
