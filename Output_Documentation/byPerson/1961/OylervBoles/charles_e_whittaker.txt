justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
or
later.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
doesn't
someone
mr.
ginsburg
have
to
make
a
determination
as
whether
the
records
of
prior
convictions
bring
the
accused
within
the
pennsylvania
recidivist
statute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
doesn't
--
doesn't
the
court
have
to
do
that?
what
you're
speaking
about
now
there's
a
matter
of
identity
is
an
issue
for
the
jury
if
denied,
isn't
it?
but
the
question
whether
--
where
the
records
are
adequate
to
invoke
the
statutes
the
question
of
law,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that
still
wouldn't
support
the
judgment
unless
the
records
of
prior
convictions
actually
invoke
the
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
when
you
say
ample
notice,
i
understood
you
a
while
ago
that
you
say
you
meant
notice
in
advance
of
the
return
of
the
indictment
or
information,
but
you
don't
really
mean
that,
do
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
--
it
wouldn't
notice
afterward
be
just
as
good?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
the
principal
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
do
you
mean
then
if
i
may
ask
by
saying
he
would
like
to
show
that
these
men
were
given
notice
that
they
were
to
be
informed
on
under
this
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
by
the
information?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
do
you
say
for
mr.
ginsburg
(inaudible)
notice
in
the
facts
of
their
plea
in
the
principle
of
a
criminal
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that
statute
would
be
void,
would
it
not
if
mr.
ginsburg
is
right
in
his
contention
that
there
must
be
notice
given
to
this
man
of
the
intention
to
proceed
against
him
under
this
habitual
offender
statute
before
the
information
or
indictment
is
returned?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
could
this
scheme
--
could
this
scheme
was
that
he
did
have
in
mind
what
mr.
justice
harlan
has
just
averted
to?
if
this
section
4
of
article
viii
section
--
chapter
62
is
a
valid
statute
as
set
--
one
set
forth
in
petitioner's
brief
at
page
38
that
gives
the
warden
a
right
to
(inaudible)
to
advise
the
court
to
--
that
the
government
prosecutor
could
leave
--
file
information
to
proceed
against
him?
do
i
make
it
clear?
do
you
understand
me?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
mr.
justice
harlan
presupposes
that
one
charge
with
the
principal
offense
in
your
courts
knowing
of
his
own
background
but
that
the
prosecutor
thought
that
doesn't
know
of
it,
will
plead
guilty
in
the
hope
that
he
will
just
be
given
a
single
sentence
not
taking
into
account
his
past
act
--
sentences.
well
could
that
scheme
ever
work
fine
if
the
statute
i'm
referring
to
that
sets
forth
on
page
38
at
mr.
ginsburg's
brief
is
a
valid
statute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
mitchell,
i
would
like
to
know
how
if
an
accused
was
brought
before
this
court
and
the
prosecutor
presented
several
certified
copies
of
past
convictions
and
sentences,
but
one
or
more
of
them
appear
obviously
to
be
subject
to
collateral
attack
for
one
reason
or
another,
how
is
this
man
ever
to
have
a
hearing
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
under
your
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
that
mean
he's
got
to
go
to
prison
for
life
just
because
you
haven't
got
a
procedure
whereby
you
can
show
one
or
more
judgments
were
void?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
is
it
quite
fair
to
say
that
not
(inaudible)
--
doesn't
oyler
say
under
his
interpretation
of
the
statute
he
wants
to
show
that
these
sentences
in
bedford
county,
pennsylvania
one
being
to
prohibition
and
the
other
to
small
(inaudible),
were
it
not
such
as
brings
them
within
your
recidivist
statute.
doesn't
he
claim
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
this
is
habeas
corpus
case,
nothing
can
be
showed
here,
then
where
can
he
show?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
(inaudible)
--
suppose
it
is
(inaudible)
off
the
record
for
that
purpose
we
have
to
assume,
our
present
purposes
it
seems
to
me
and
we
have
to
assume
that
is
(inaudible),
do
we
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
is
he
entitled
to
relief
in
a
habeas
corpus
hearing?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
what
he
says
is
true,
is
there
room
to
say
that
the
judgment
(inaudible)
judgments
in
pennsylvania
were
void?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
one
more
question
and
i'm
through.
now
supposing
he
wants
to
put
the
matter
before
your
highest
court
to
reexamine
that
case,
then
doesn't
he
have
to
show
us
the
facts
which
would
bring
him
relief
if
the
rule
be
changed
now
then
he
is
entitled,
wouldn't
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
that
--
is
he
entitled
under
his
averments
here
to
that
right,
attempt
to
threaten
to
change
that
rule?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
is
he
cut
off
from
that
if
he
is
denied
the
right
to
put
that
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
