justice

how
--
how
many
days
after
the
west
virginia
--?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
he's
been
--
had
been
on
the
locking
key
of
--
during
those
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
brought
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
after
the
seven
days?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court-appointed
--
by
his
court-pointed
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
his
counsel
--
was
his
court-appointed
counsel
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
show
what
if
any
participation
counsel
took
in
these
proceedings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginsburg.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
inference
is
certainly
permissible
namely
that
his
counsel
must
had
been
notified
to
be
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
does
a
motion
for
new
trial
required
personal
presence
of
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
happened
to
be
just
--
that
much
must
--
there
must
be
inference
to
--
in
somehow
rather
would
notify
to
be
there
or
brought
himself
there
contemporaneously
with
this
proceeding
on
the
recidivist
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
going
an
inference
for
a
minute.
i'm
just
trying
to
know
what
happens.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
--
would
convicted
defendant
have
to
be
present
when
his
counsel
filed
the
motion
for
new
trial?
the
point
of
my
question
is
evidently
--
evidently,
the
authorities
brought
him
in
with
reference
to
recidivist
matter,
whatever
may
have
been
notification
to
counsel.
i'm
not
drawing
any
inference
of
events.
i
just
want
to
know
what
happened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
he
had
been
sentenced
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
merely
acted
and
convicted
for
second
degree
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
you
give
us
merely
the
--
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
statutory
term.
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
gotten
the
general
entries
of
the
clerk
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
then
maybe
--
then
maybe
pennsylvania
local
law
and
the
pennsylvania
law
as
to
what
to
state
is
(inaudible)
the
person
sent
there,
pennsylvania
purposes,
he
may
not
be
deemed
to
have
been
convicted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
19
--
1955
doesn't
mean
that
that
state
of
the
original
statute,
does
it
mr.
ginsburg?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginsburg,
i
am
now
--
i
want
to
refer
to
the
graham
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
now
looked
at
the
graham
case
and
while
it
is
true
as
you've
said
that
the
statute
at
the
time
or
one
of
statutes,
one
of
provisions
of
west
virginia
at
the
time
provided
for
inclusion
in
the
indictment,
an
allegation
in
the
indictment,
the
particular
case
--
and
the
particular
case
that
wasn't
the
situation.
the
indictment
in
that
case
did
not
mention
the
prior
conviction,
but
the
case
arose
under
another
provision
that
provision
would
you
set
forth
on
page
38
of
your
brief
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
38,
isn't
it?
38,
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
the
provision
for
subsequently
calling
attention
to
the
court
for
information
that
the,
convicted
defendant
that
has
prior
record
of
convictions
and
in
that
case
notice
there
was
a
separate
proceeding
on
information
so
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
--
justice
hughes's
opinion,
the
only
thing
that
was
contested
as
to
whether
this
--
whether
graham
--
was
the
graham,
the
prior
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
matter
of
identification
only
and
--
and
one
does
not
know
what
else
was
open.
so
that
there
was
notice
at
least
that
that
issue
was
contested,
but
in
--
in
this
case,
nothing
turns
on
identification,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
was
going
to
say,
the
--
the
issues
were
different
so
far
as
notice
is
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
notice
concerned,
there
was
notice
of
course
in
graham
in
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
notice
here.
well,
if
you
permit
me,
there
was
notice
when
he
was
told
what
the
consequences
of
the
manner
in
which
he
was
told
at
the
circumstances
is
really
the
question
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
the
--
the
--
what
the
local
west
virginia
law
is
unless
your
state
is
so
big
we
can't
tell,
outside
of
our
province,
isn't
it,
what
really
are
you
complaining
are
and
my
--
the
--
the
earnestness
of
my
question
doesn't
betray
an
answer
i
can
assure
you,
what
is
it
you're
complaining
now
that
he
didn't
have
a
chance
to
confess
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
he
said,
“yes,
i'm
the
oyler.
i'm
the
oyler”
and
everything
you
say
is
true
about
those
convictions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
to
sharpen
in
my
own
mind,
my
understanding
of
exactly
what
we
have
to
decide
in
this
case.
suppose
the
trial
judge
had
said
mr.
jones,
the
counsel
to
the
oyler,
you
have
heard
the
information
and
the
facts
there
in
set
forth,
these
prior
convictions
in
wherever
for,
the
pennsylvania
county.
have
you
anything
--
you
want
time
to
consider
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
he
said
no
--
suppose
he's
said
no,
what
would
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
the
record
here
is
balance
to
really
what
took
place,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
even
if
it
–
barren
--
sufficient
--
sufficient
for
your
purpose,
but
i
just
wonder
what
it
is
ultimately,
that
this
case
cutting
it
to
bone
what
--
how
--
where
in
this
case
defer
from
graham
in
which
there
was
tried
merely
the
identification
and
--
nor
of
course,
you
can
say
(inaudible)
doesn't
understand
that
they
weren't
(inaudible),
were
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
issues
one
place
in
graham.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
is
it
unfair
--
is
it
unfair
to
say
that
what
this
cause
really
gets
down
to
is
that
he
had
a
lawyer
within
--
and
oppose
the
cautionary
proceeding
or
cautionary
conduct
on
his
part
that
the
lawyer
should
have
exercised
and
the
attorney
gets
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
lawyer
was
right
there.
he
could
have
said,
“your
honor
one
minute,
i
have
two
things
to
say.
i
have
several
things
to
say”
which
i
would
acknowledge
if
you
told
me
mr.
ginsburg,
namely
that
he
could
be
a
contradiction
in
the
west
virginia
legislation.
it's
ambiguous.
it's
obscure.
i
want
to
look
at
what
the
--
the
industrial
confinement
(inaudible)
mean,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
suppose
he
said
that
and
the
judge
said
that
i
don't
want
to
hear
you
then
it
--
then
he
had
a
clear
case
of
setting
off
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
employer
just
--
just
was
mute
for
all
the
record
shows.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
my
hypothetic
lawyer
had
been
alert
and
aggressive
as
lawyer
should
be,
the
court
could
properly,
according
to
west
virginia
law
had
sealed
his
mouth
and
said,
“i
don't
--
"
justice
felix
frankfurter
“i'm
not
going
to
hear
you.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
may
not
hear,
the
law
who
precludes
my
hearings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
say
that's
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginsburg.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you
didn't
file
the
petition
to
this
case
and
(inaudible)
afterwards,
but
now
that
i
understand
your
--
your
petition,
tested
procedure,
you'd
agree
that
procedurally
this
is
really
on
the
plead
because
you're
attacking
the
statute,
is
that
right?
i
don't
--
i
don't
make
any
difference
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
validly
here,
but
you're
really
attacking
the
statute
in
(inaudible)
to
an
appeal,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
just
want
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well,
i
don't
--
as
i
said,
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
position
nor
the
petitioner's
position,
but
you're
really
attacking
the
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
you're
saying
that
a
contentious
judge
particularly,
you
got
at
that
lots
of
cases
would
say,
‘i
am
sorry
mr.
jones
but
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
time
in
eve
because
the
statute
circumscribe
my
--
the
proceedings
now
before
me
nearly
do
ascertain
identification
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
notice
of
what,
because
there
was
notice
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
assure
you,
i'm
not
reading
it
anyway
at
any
moment
except
for
the
purpose
of
asking
question.
as
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
very
--
the
provision
of
the
law
nearly
the
man,
the
district
--
to
local
judge,
the
west
virginia
judge
to
give
to
ascertain
the
identically
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
man
who
is
charged
by
a
conviction
and
that
if
as
an
indulgent
man,
he
says,
“alright,
i'll
just
leave
it
to
mr.
jones,”
but
a
perfectly
conscientious
judge
could
say,
“i'm
circumscribed
by
the
statute”
not
to
do
this
--
not
to
do
anything
in
this
case,
except
to
ascertain
identity
and
then
automatically
to
impose
this
heavier
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
that
--
if
that
is
the
requirement
of
the
statute,
i
think
you
brought
it
back
in
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
that
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
prior
to
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
prior
to
plead.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
the
graham
case
points
out
and
very
often
you
don't
know
until
after
the
fellow
is
convicted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
does
that
imply
that
you
think
it's
a
necessary
determination
in
the
main
case
that
the
jury
should
determine
the
recidivist
aspect
of
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
graham
says
just
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
--
then
what's
the
point
of
saying
prior
to
his
plea.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what
do
you
do
with
chapter
62
and
that
is
discovered
only
after
the
man
has
been
in
jail
two
years?
must
then
the
whole
proceedings
be
set
aside?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
the
plea
is
not
guilty
and
the
(inaudible)
merits
and
he's
convicted.
and
the
day
after
conviction,
the
state
discovers
that
he
has
a
record
because
he
changed
his
name
etcetera,
etcetera,
et
cetera,
points
out
to
graham,
are
there
proper
proceedings
be
set
aside
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
going
all
over
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
this
is
restricted
merely
to
the
plea
of
guilty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
would
--
would
the
--
the
recidivist
aspect
go
before
the
whole
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
if
he
--
that
he
pled
guilty
on
the
assumption
he
could
only
get
five
years,
but
later
he
discovers
that
they
tracked
him
down
and
found
his
prior
to
the
record.
you
say
that
that
due
process
requires
that
he
then
he
then
given
a
run
for
his
money
before
a
jury
and
that
the
defendant's
lawyer
might
pull
the
jury,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
unfairness
has
there
been
up
to
the
point
that
he
pled
guilty
on
a
charge
and
i'm
assuming
all
the
other
circumstances
do
not
make
put
a
case
of
due
process,
what
unfairness
requires
that
that
proceeding
be
set
aside
that
his
plea
of
guilty
be
allowed
to
be,
to
be
--
he
was
drawn
for
that
reason.
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
unfair
of
me
and
i
hate
to
think
i
was
a
cruel
man,
isn't
unfair
of
me
to
say
that
that
means,
that
he
thought
he
was
going
to
get
five
years
because
his
file
identity
has
been
well-concealed,
but
now
that
he's
informed
of
it,
he
wants
to
have
another
go
at
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
happened
to
think
that
it's
very
unfair
to
put
it
in
the
indictments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
evidently,
it
was
implied
or
can
you
say
of
the
bearing
of
graham
on
the
question
of
chief
justice
just
put
because
i'm
not
--
all
these
things
and
i'm
not
very
sympathetic
to
the
whole
(inaudible)
of
recidivist
myself,
that's
beside
the
point,
but
the
whole
graham
case
rests
evidently
that
all
that
is
--
was
on
the
question
of
--
of
determination
of
identity
would
the
consequence
of
a
life
sentence
pursued?
merely,
the
determination
of
identity
whether
that
--
that
advice
and
determination
out
to
a
jury
that
--
whether
that
satis
--
or
not
to
an
indictment
et
cetera
as
other
(inaudible).
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
look
at
the
briefs
in
graham.
but
if
then
an
underneath
questions
were
stood
in
that,
this
whether.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
could
argue,
i
suppose
the
state
will
let
him
--
in
this
case,
he
had
--
his
lawyer
had
ample
opportunity
to
open
his
mouth
and
he
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
i
follow
that
in
a
great
clarity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
showed
that
in
practice
but
it
isn't
mandatory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
mean
i
don't
have
--
has
not
been
attended
at
the
moment.
does
that
mean
they
don't
bring
the
matters
to
the
attention
of
courts
or
they
do
and
courts
do
nothing
about
it
if
you
got
statistics
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
mean
--
if
that's
an
inference
drawn
by
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
--
well
perhaps
the
attorney
general
should
laid
on
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
--
i
can
see
how
the
walla
walla
--
the
difference
in
the
counties
act
there
in
identification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
party
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
if
the
custom
identification
is
now
pertinent
what
(inaudible)
could
it
have
apart
from
--
i
always
concede
that
your
statutory
point
be
different
from
once
you
talked
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
use
to
answer
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
--
as
a
matter
of
practice,
he's
allowed
to
interpose
considerations
other
than
lack
of
(inaudible)
and
mis-identity.
i
think
you
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
practice.
but
i
want
to
know
you've
also
said
there
is
no
decision
dealing
with
it.
is
there
any
reference
in
any
--
in
any
opinion,
either
by
the
lower
court
or
by
your
supreme
court?
is
there
any
statement
in
crabtree
which
reflects
that
practice?
is
there
any
statement?
i
don't
mean
an
adjudication
but
very
often,
judges
in
writing,
state
as
the
matter
of
fact,
reference
so
to
the
fact
under
this
state.
do
you
recall
any
such
reference
shorter
than
actual
adjudication?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
i
looked
at
the
briefs
as
--
has
talked
to
mr.
ginsburg
in
the
graham
case
and
the
graham
--
graham
was
--
the
case
was
argued
here,
on
the
brief
there
is
--
one
of
the
(inaudible)
lawyers
of
this
day
mr.
frank
holden
and
he
takes
it
for
granted.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that's
controlling
law
but
(inaudible)
shed
some
light
in
this
groping
darkness
and
in
that
brief
that
it
said,
“the
only
defense
opened
in
west
virginia
is
identical,”
the
issue
of
identification.
as
i
say
that
--
that
goes
no
more
than
accounts
a
statement.
it
is
interesting
to
me
that
none
of
these
questions
was
raised
in
that
case.
maybe
there's
no
basis
for
raising
any.
the
graham
case
went
entirely
in
challenging
the
method
for
determining
identity
namely,
by
way
of
information
against
in
your
state,
you
have
to
have
an
indictment
(inaudible)
felony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
groping
to
see
whether
there's
anything
in
any
legal,
in
any
weighty
pronouncement
by
any
judge
that
as
a
matter
of
practice,
mr.
hogan
was
wrong
in
saying
the
only
defense
is
to
establish
identification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
speak
out
of
you
own
experience.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
been
--
you've
been
in
the
justice
department
of
the
state
of
west
virginia,
how
long
mr.
mitchell?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
fifth
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
you
presented
criminal
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
--
and
the
records
come
over
or
the
proceedings
come
over
your
desk
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
agree
to
(inaudible)
that
what
he
is
challenging
(inaudible)
i
think
is
constitutionality
of
the
statute
namely
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
wouldn't
(inaudible)
even
into
these
case
(inaudible)

justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
think
about
it,
(inaudible),
i
can
assume
here
(inaudible)
what
happens
in
this
case,
the
district
attorney
having
seen
the
information,
soon
after
the
conviction
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would've
been
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
case
here,
(inaudible)
rather
what
was
done,
it
was
made
(inaudible)
but
there
they
are,
the
accused
and
his
lawyer
and
the
judge
(inaudible).
the
judge
asks
him,
do
you
understand
it?
he
says
he
does
(inaudible),
that's
all
i
ever
asked.
(inaudible)
anything
after
the
act
you
need
to
say
(inaudible)
--
whether
that
court
decision
tends
to
be
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
from
your
(inaudible)
that
issue
was
not
all
over
you,
you
must
have
had
known,
this
is
on
the
(inaudible)
a
question
of
fact
whether
he
was
(inaudible),
that's
all
in
the
trial,
and
not
to
assume
what
(inaudible)
on
the
basis
of
