mr.
david
ginsburg
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors
may
it
please
the
court.
the
oyler
and
crabtree
cases
number
56
and
57
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
the
states
of
west
virginia.
both
cases
involve
the
application
of
the
west
virginia
habitual
criminal
law.
oyler
and
crabtree
both
filed
petitions
for
application
for
habeas
corpus
with
the
supreme
court
--
west
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
in
1960.
in
those
applications,
they
alleged
that
the
state
had
not
acted
in
the
corpus
within
its
own
law.
they
also
alleged
that
the
action
of
the
trail
court
was
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
they
also
alleged
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process
in
that,
they
had
had
no
pretrial
notice
that
the
habitual
criminal
law
would
be
invoked
against
them.
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
denied
the
writs
without
calling
for
return,
without
hearing,
without
an
opinion.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
undisputed.
oyler
was
indicted
for
murder.
he
was
arraigned
and
assigned
court-appointed
counsel.
he
pleaded
not
guilty.
he
was
tried
and
he
was
convicted
of
murder
in
the
second
degree.
murder
in
the
second
degree
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
west
virginia
carries
a
penalty
of
five
to
18
years
in
prison,
penitentiary.
about
a
week
later,
without
prior
notice,
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
taylor
county
filed
an
information
that
oyler
had
three
times
been
indicted
for
felonies,
breaking
and
entering,
burglary
and
grand
larceny
and
that
all
of
these
had
taken
place
in
bedford
county
pennsylvania.
oyler
was
asked
whether
he
was
the
person
who
has
identified
in
the
information
and
he
acknowledged
that
he
was.
mr.
david
ginsburg
he
had
been
three
times
indicted
and
convicted.
mr.
david
ginsburg
and
convicted.
there
was
no
reference
in
the
information,
in
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
order
of
commitment
to
the
sentence
and
i
shall
proceed
to
and
consider
the
differentiation
between
the
crime
which
was
alleged
in
the
sentence
which
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
seven
days.
mr.
david
ginsburg
he
had
been
on
the
locking
key
during
this
period.
mr.
david
ginsburg
he
was
brought
before
the
court,
he
stood
there.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes,
what
actually
happened
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
that
there
was
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
the
--
that
motion
was
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
by
his
court-appointed
counsel.
that
motion
was
denied.
the
man
was
then
brought
before
the
court.
the
prosecuting
attorney
then
rose,
presented
an
information
to
the
court.
we
don't
know
on
the
basis
of
this
record
whether
that
information
was
actually
handed
to
the
court
at
on
that
day.
in
fact,
the
information
is
dated
a
--
two
days
later.
the
order
of
commitment
which
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
was
dated
on
11th
for
the
month.
the
--
the
information
happens
to
be
dated
the
13th.
mr.
david
ginsburg
his
court-appointed
counsel
was
present.
he
was
standing
there.
he
heard
the
information
read.
he
saw
it
presented.
he
was
asked
and
under
the
laws
of
the
state
west
virginia,
that's
all
that
could
have
been
done.
he
was
asked
whether
he
was
this
--
was
the
person
identified
the
information.
he
said,
“he
was.”
mr.
david
ginsburg
there
was
no
request
for
an
adjournment
your
honor,
but
the
--
as
these
matters
move
of
neither
had
notice.
neither
the
defendant
nor
the
counsel
had
prior
notice
that
an
information
was
to
be
brought
in.
they
heard
it
there
for
the
first
time.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
sir,
the
record
is
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
sir.
what
--
mr.
justice
whittaker
what
actually
happened
was
that
he
was
tried
and
convicted
for
second
degree
murder
and
then
he
was
taken
back
to
jail.
a
week
later,
he
was
brought
back.
he
counsel
in
the
meantime
had
filed
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
his
motion
for
the
new
trial
was
denied.
a
--
an
information
was
then
handed
up
to
the
--
to
the
judge,
alleging
that
he
had
three
times
before
been
convicted
of
felonies.
i
want
to
go
into
this
matter
of
the
felonies
which
were
alleged
in
--
in
the
information.
and
immediately,
the
judge
turned
to
the
prisoner,
asked
whether
he
was
the
man
identified
in
the
information.
he
said,
“he
was,”
he
was.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
his
counsel
--
there
--
the
only
inference
that
can
drawn
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
that
his
counsel
had
filed
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
david
ginsburg
indeed
it
does
and
i
would
--
but
there's--
mr.
david
ginsburg
there
is
absolutely
no
--
there
is
nothing
of
the
record
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
in
anyway
can
indicate
that
his
counsel
had
prior
notice
and
indeed
sir,
i
believe
that
there
is
clear
indication
that
he
probably
did
not
because
the
information
had
attached
to
it
dated
--
from
the
coun
--
from
the
court
in
bedford
county
pennsylvania
dated
two
days
before.
he
was
brought
in
on
the
11th.
on
the
9th
of
the
month,
the
court
of
the
county
court
in
bedford
county
pennsylvania
certified,
it's
in
the
record,
certified
that
there
had
been
these
prior
offenses.
now
it's
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
--
just
to
finish.
i
think
that
it's
highly
unlikely
on
the
basis
of
that
indication
and
still
any
indication
we
have
in
the
record
that
counsel
in
fact
knew
that
the
recidivist
charge
would
be
brought
up
before
the
court
on
that
day.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
cannot
tell
beyond
but
i've
indicating
on
basis
of
the
record
that
we
have
here
and
for
myself,
i
find
it
the
difficult
to
draw
inferences
on
this.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
the
11th
was
the
--
no
sir.
the
11th
was
the
date
of
the
order
of
commitment.
that's
the
date
in
which
the
court
recites.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
was
on
that
day.
mr.
david
ginsburg
on
that
same
day.
if
the
court
would
turn
page
28
of
number
56
of
the
oyler
record,
this
day
came
the
state
by
her
prosecuting
attorney
as
well
as
the
defendant
william
oyler
in
person
--
and
in
the
custody
of
its
sherif.
and
sat
at
bar
of
the
court
and
was
represented
by
william
t.
george
sr.,
his
counsel.
and
thereupon,
the
defendant
by
counsel
tended
leave
and
asked
leave
to
file
his
memorandum
in
writing,
assigning
grounds
and
support
of
the
motion.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes,
--
he
was
--
as
far
as
the
record
indicates
in
that
order,
counsel
was
there
to
file
his
memorandum
and
support
of
his
motion
for
a
new
trail.
the
motion
then
thus
we
see
in
the
rest
of
the
paragraph
is
overruled.
and
thereupon,
the
secretary
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
all
that
we
know
sir
is
indicated
in
that
paragraph
and
the
court
perceiving
no
good
grounds
therefore.
the
said
motion
was
overruled
to
which
action
of
the
court,
the
defendant
objects
and
accepts.
that's
all
we
know.
mr.
david
ginsburg
there
were
certainly
was
some
proceeding
on
the
motion
for
new
trial.
but
there
is
no
indication.
presumably,
that's
why
a
counsel
is
there,
but
there
was
no
indication
that
counsel
had
any
prior
awareness
that
the
--
an
information
would
be
filed.
and
indeed,
as
i'll
indicate
later
on,
there
is
a
decision
of
the
highest
court
in
the
state
west
virginia
which
says
that
no
notice
is
required.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
this
is
indeed
the
sentencing
day.
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
defendant
was
there
to
be
sentenced.
he
was
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
he
know
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
he
had
been
convicted
and
sentenced
but
it
was
deferred.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
sentence
was
deferred
and
this
was
sentencing
day.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
not
--
there
was
no
reference
to
his
specific
day
--
to
his
specific
day
--
a
day
sir.
what
actually
happened
is
that
so
far
as
we
can
see
he
was
--
his
counsel
brought
in
his
motion
for
a
new
trial.
the
--
the
memorandum
was
filed.
that
action
was
overruled.
the
prosecuting
attorney
then
get
up
--
got
up
and
handed
in
his
information
and
the
man
was
then
sentenced.
this
point,
there
are
some
significance.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
of
the
record
on
page
28,
and
the
court
proceeding
to
pass
sentence
upon
the
defendant,
upon
the
verdict
of
murder
in
the
second
degree,
found
by
the
jury
on
the
trial
of
the
charge
contained
in
the
indictment
herein
and
upon
the
former
convictions
of
felonies
as
after
said
then
sentenced
him
to
life.
he
could
not
have
been
sentenced
to
life
under
the
life
imprisonment
under
--
for
the
offense
which
he
had
originally
been
charged.
mr.
david
ginsburg
we
do
not
sir.
now,
the
court
would
further
notice
on
this
paragraph
that
the
--
the
trial
court
then
recommended
parole,
parole
for
the
defendant,
as
soon
as
he
was
eligible
therefore.
now,
the
order
of
commitment
which
we
just
looked
at
is
dated
february
11.
the
information
--
the
information
which
presumably
was
handed
up
on
that
day
is
contained
on
page
13
of
this
record.
that
information
is
dated
february
13th.
now,
apart
from
the
discrepancy
in
dates,
it's
interesting
to
examine
what
it
was
that
this
man
was
charged
or
what
he
did
he
do,
why
was
he
charged
now
under
the
recidivist
statute?
these
were
the
charges.
first,
that
he
had
stolen
an
automobile.
that
he
had
pleaded
guilty,
waved
counsel
and
that
he
had
been
placed
on
probation.
he
had
not
been
sentenced
to
jail
nor
had
even
sentenced
to
penitentiary.
second,
a
year
later,
this
same
man
oyler,
had
broken
into
a
drug
store,
stolen
$50
and
a
week
after
that,
broken
a
second
time,
stole
a
$198.
what
happened?
was
he
sent
to
jail?
no.
the
second
time
he
was
fine
$25
on
each
count
and
he
was
sent
to
the
pennsylvania
industrial
school
at
camp
hill.
this
was
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
at
that
time,
the
record
does
not
indicated.
my
brother
mitchell
has
included
the
fact
in
his
memorandum.
he
was
20
years
old.
now,
it
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
state
of
west
virginia
and
properly,
that
this
was
done
under
a
pennsylvania
statute
which
permitted
males
between
the
ages
of
15
and
21
to
be
sent
to
the
pennsylvania
industrial
school
in
cases
where
they
could
have
been
sent
to
the
penitent
--
to
the
penitentiary.
it's
true.
oyler
could
have
been
sent
to
the
penitentiary
for
these
offenses.
he
was
not
because
the
court
exercised
its
discretion
to
send
him
to
the
industrial
school.
that
was
the
--
and
this
is
one
of
the
factors
in
the
case.
well,
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
we
will
have
that
problem
when
we
come
to
the
law
in
west
virginia
and
that
we'll
come
specifically
to
it.
mr.
david
ginsburg
first
offense,
he
was
placed
in
probation.
he
was
fined
a
$100
and
placed
on
probation.
second
time,
he
fined
$25
each
time
and
then
sent
to
the
industrial
school
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
ginsburg
surely.
mr.
david
ginsburg
as
far
as
i
can
see
that's
possible
mr.
justice,
but
i'm
not
clear
on
that
myself.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
don't
find
that
sir
in
the
order
of
commitment
which
is
dated
february
11th
on
page
28
of
the
record.
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
information
is
quite
clear,
quite
specific
in
the
fact
that
i've
recited,
but
that
information,
that
data
as
far
as
we
can
see
may
or
may
not
have
been
before
the
court.
we
don't
know
because
the
court
in
its
order
of
commitment
seeks
to
incorporate
the
information
by
reference
but
the
information
apparently
was
prepared
at
least
two
days
later
so
far
as
we
can
see
from
the
dates.
it
may
not
be
so.
it
maybe
an
--
an
error
on
the
date
in
the
record
but
these
are
facts
we
haven't.
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
we'll
come
to
the
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
we'll
come
to
text
of
the
recidivist
statute
in
just
a
moment
sir.
now,
the
facts
in
the
crabtree
case
are
also
undisputed.
crabtree
was
indicted
in
lincoln
county
west
virginia
for
forging
a
$35
check.
that
was
the
offense
for
which
he
was
brought
before
the
court.
in
oyler,
the
man
pleaded
not
guilty
and
was
given
a
trial.
crabtree
pleaded
guilty
and
he
was
subject
for
that
offense
to
a
penalty
up
in
two
to
10
years.
now
again,
a
week
after
the
arraignment,
the
county
prosecuting
attorney
filed
an
information,
invoking
the
state's
habitual
criminal
law
and
he
did
so
on
these
grounds.
first,
that
in
1954,
crabtree
had
been
sentenced
by
the
criminal
court
of
walla
walla
in
the
state
of
west
--
in
the
state
of
washington
for
the
crime
again
of
forgery
and
had
served
two
and
half
years
in
the
state
penitentiary
in
the
state
of
washington
and
secondly
because
in
1947,
he
had
also
been
sentenced
to
the
state
penitentiary
in
west
virginia
by
the
cabell
county
criminal
court.
crabtree
admitted
when
he
was
called
before
the
court
in
the
exactly
the
same
procedure
that
we've
indicated
heretofore.
that
he
was
the
person
who
was
identified
in
the
information
which
had
been
–
which
was
handed
up
at
that
time.
mr.
david
ginsburg
he
did
have
a
lawyer
sir,
yes
sir.
and
in
his
habeas
corpus
petition,
however,
he
pointed
out
that
there
was
an
error
in
the
information
that
he
had
not
been
brought
before
the
criminal
court
in
walla
walla.
he
had
been
brought
before
the
criminal
court
in
yakima.
my
brother
mitchell
of
the
state
of
west
virginia
will
argue
that
this
is
harmless
error.
the
point
which
i
shall
make
in
this
case
is
that
he
never
had
an
opportunity
to
test
whether
this
error
or
other
errors
was
or
was
not
harmless.
now,
crabtree
in
his
habeas
corpus
petition
just
as
oyler
did
raise
the
constitutional
point
which
i've
been
indicated
equal
protection
and
procedural
due
process
and
now,
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
west
virginia
statute.
the
statute
effects
of
it,
is
indicated
in
--
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief,
sections
18
and
19,
two
sections;
first
section
18;
punishment
for
second
or
third
offense
of
felony.
when
any
person
is
convicted
of
an
offense
and
the
subject
to
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
therefore,
and
it
is
the
determined
as
provided
in
section
19
of
this
article
that
such
person
had
been
before
convicted
in
the
united
states
of
a
crime
punishable
by
imprisonment
in
penitentiary,
the
court
shall,
the
court
shall,
if
the
sentence
to
be
imposed
as
definite
term
of
years
so
on,
add
five
years.
and
then
the
second
paragraph
which
is
the
paragraph
applicable
to
this
case,
when
it
is
determined,
again,
as
provided
in
section
19
hereon
that
such
person
shall
have
been
twice
before
convicted
in
the
united
states
of
a
crime
and
these
are
the
operative
words
“punishable
by
confinement
in
the
penitentiary.”
well,
so
far
--
so
--
as
so
far
as
concern
--
concerns
oyler,
the
crimes
which
he
had
committed,
were
as
i've
said,
subject
to
--
he
could
have
been
confined
in
the
penitentiary
for
those
crimes.
he
was
not
in
fact,
he
was
on
the
--
the
one
case
put
on
provision
and
the
other
case
sent
to
an
industrial
school,
but
now,
if
the
court
will
--
will
look
at
section
19.
“it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
prosecuting
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
section
19,
the
following
section
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
oh
on
--
it's
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
david
ginsburg
and
it's
the
section
which
gives
me
some
concern.
“it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
when
he
has
knowledge
of
former
sentence
or
sentences
to
the
penitentiary,
when
he
has
knowledge
of
sentences
to
the
penitentiary
of
any
person
convicted
of
an
offense
punishable
by
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
to
give
information
to
the
court
thereof
immediately
upon
conviction
and
before
sentence.
now,
if
we
focus
exclusively
on
section
18,
it
seems
to
be
quite
clear
that
the
issue
is
whether
the
person
was
subject
to
an
offense
punishable
by
confinement
in
the
penitentiary.
section
18
concentrates
on
the
offense.
section
19,
however,
seems
to
point
to
the
punishment,
was
he
in
fact
confined
in
the
penitentiary?
this
gives
rise
to
one
of
the
ambiguities,
one
of
the
problems
in
the
case.
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
west
virginia.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
will
come
to
that
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
don't
--
i'm
not
clear
in
my
own
mind
as
to
whether
they
have.
i
believe
that
the
court
has
indicated
its
view
in
a
case
where
the
constitutional
issue,
the
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
issue,
it
was
not
raised.
it
was
concerned
to
that
case
as
will
see
in
the
blankenship
case
solely
with
the
problem
of
statutory
interpretation
under
the
west
virginia
law.
now,
as
i
read
the
statute,
there
are
various
conclusions
that
follow
from
the
text
of
the
law.
first,
the
application
of
this
statute
is
mandatory.
there
is
one
other
provision
of
the
statute
which
it
might
be
worth
looking
at
by
way
of
contrast.
section
18
is
--
as
i've
been
indicated,
deals
with
problem
with
the
offense.
section
19,
a
procedural
section
but
also
refers
to
the
matter
of
the
sentence.
and
then
on
page
38,
the
bottom
of
the
page,
there
is
a
procedure
in
sentencing
convicts
to
further
confinement
for
second
or
third
offense.
this
--
this
statue
deals
with
the
problem
where
to
the
convicts
have
actually
been
imprisoned
and
then
the
warden
learns
that
they
had
been
subject
to
prior
offenses
and
it
provides
a
procedure
whereby
the
convicts
maybe
taken
from
the
state
penitentiary
and
then
subject
to
the
procedures,
the
habitual
offender
is
active
in
recidivist
statute.
and
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
sharp
distinction
between
sections
18
and
19
on
the
one
hand
in
this
other
provision
which
can
invoke
a
separate
procedure.
in
the
one
case,
it's
permissive.
the
warden
of
the
penitentiary
on
the
top
of
page
39
may
give
information
thereof.
in
10
years,
this
provision
has
not
been
invoked.
in
the
case
of
sections
18
and
19,
they
are
mandatory.
it
is
obligatory
on
the
--
on
the
prosecuting
attorney
if
he
has
knowledge
to
give
that
knowledge
to
the
court
and
to
invoke
the
statute.
there
is
no
discretion
in
connection
with
the
west
virginia
recidivist
statute.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
sir.
this
statute
was
amended
1943
and
i
think
it's
well
now
to
take
a
look
at
--
reference
has
been
made
in
--
by
my
brother
mitchell
to
this
case
landmark
case
in
this
area,
of
graham
against
west
virginia.
and
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
the
court
to
examine
the
statute
which
was
before
the
court
in
graham
against
west
virginia
and
the
text
of
it
is
set
out
on
the
petitioner's
brief
on
page
--
the
bottom
of
page
31.
this
was
the
statute
in
graham
against
west
virginia
and
it
sharply
--
is
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
statute
that
we
have
here,
the
bottom
of
page
31
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
when
any
person
is
convicted
of
an
offense
and
sentenced
to
confinement
therefore
in
the
penitentiary
and
it
is
alleged
than
the
indictment
on
which
he
is
convicted
and
admitted
or
by
the
jury
found
that
he
had
been
before
sentence
in
the
united
states
to
a
life
punishment.
he
shall
be
sentenced
to
be
confined
to
five
years
and
so
on.
there
is
absolutely
no
doubt
that
in
the
statute
that
was
before
the
court
in
graham
against
west
virginia.
first,
there
is
no
problem
of
procedural
due
process,
because
he
had
noticed
under
the
graham
statute,
he
had
noticed
that
habitual
offender
procedure
would
be
invoked
against
them
because
it
had
to
in
the
indictment.
secondly,
the
statute
is
explicit
that
the
offenses
must
have
not
only
been
subject
to
confinement
in
the
penitentiary,
but
that
the
man
must
actually
have
been
confined
with
the
penitentiary.
the
two
issues
that
are
involved
in
this
case
would
not
have
been
involved
in
graham
against
west
virginia.
mr.
david
ginsburg
and
that's
what
i
point
out
sir
at
the
bottom
of
page
32,
the
continuation
of
the
footnote.
in
1943,
the
law
was
amended
to
prohibit
reference
to
previous
convictions
and
indictment.
this
was
done
to
safeguard
the
interest
of
the
prisoner
and
to
prevent
prejudice.
there
is
no
indication,
however,
that
the
state
legislature
in
1943
also
intended
to
change
the
requirement
that
prior
offenses
for
purpose
of
the
act
must
have
been
subject
by
confinement
in
the
penitentiary.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
west
virginia
statute,
mr.
chief
justice,
has
been
subject
to
widespread
criticism,
both
before
and
after
1943.
some
of
the
materials
are
indicated
in
the
brief.
it
has
been
treated;
it
has
been
discussed
as
if
this
1943
statute
was
mandatory.
i'm
not
my
own
mind
clear
that
it
was.
i
know
that
the
commentators
have
so
regard
there,
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
person
statute
is
one
of
the
few
in
the
country
would
--
in
this
field
which
is
absolutely
mandatory
that
it
must
be
invoked
and
that
the
only
purpose
for
bringing
the
man
before
him
--
before
the
court
is
the
matter
of
identification,
is
he
the
man.
if
--
is
the
man,
he
must
--
if
he's
brought
before
the
court
for
that
purpose,
he
must
be
sentenced
for
life
imprisonment
or
subject
to
the
enhanced
penalty.
mr.
david
ginsburg
in
fact
their
cases
have
risen
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
sir,
where
other
--
where
defenses
have
been
raised.
whether
they
were
raised
on
the
basis
of
the
court's
own
motion
on
the
base
of
argument
on
a
--
on
--
on
habeas
corpus
petitions
or
whether
they
were
actively
discussed
below,
this
is
not
apparent
in
the
cases.
but
the
--
the
procedure
in
this
case
is
unique
in
the
sense
that
the
man
is
not
permitted
in
anyway
to
comment
on
--
to
raise
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
statute,
simply
to
determine
whether
this
statute
is
applicable
to
him
at
all
in
terms,
in
the
jurisdictional
sense.
now,
there
were
two
--
there
are
two
decisions,
in
the
highest
court
of
west
virginia
which
i
think
they're
on
this
--
this
matter.
one
is
johnson
and
skeen
and
this
really
bears
on
the
oyler
case.
johnson
and
skeen,
is
discussed
in
the
respondent's
brief
on
page
17.
the
court
had
before
it
habeas
corpus
application
which
sought
release
from
a
life
sentence
to
the
penitentiary,
under
the
habitual
criminal
law,
on
the
ground
that
one
of
the
prior
sentences
had
not
been
to
a
penitentiary,
but
had
been
to
a
jail,
and
the
facts
in
that
case
maybe
of
interest.
johnson
had
pleaded
not
guilty
to
a
charge
of
malicious
wounding
and
the
he
changed
it
to
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
charge
of
unlawful
wounding.
this
happened
the
second
time.
again,
he
pleaded
not
guilty
to
a
charge
of
malicious
wounding
and
then
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
lesser
crime
of
unlawful
wound.
this
time,
the
second
offense,
he
reached
an
understanding
with
the
prosecutor
attorney
in
the
county
that
he
would
be
sent
not
to
pen
--
the
penitentiary,
but
he
would
be
sent
to
the
county
jail
for
six
months
and
he
would
be
fined
$50.00
and
it
happened
the
13th.
johnson
was
once
more
indicted
from
murder
and
this
time,
the
recidivist
statute
was
invoked
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
subject
to
a
sentence
of
--
he
was
subject
to
crimes
punishable
by
imprisonment
in
the
penitentiary,
punishable
by
imprisonment
in
the
penitentiary,
because
he
could
have
been.
he
could
have
been
sent
to
the
penitentiary
in
both
cases
for
unlawful
wounding.
in
one
case,
he
was
and
the
other
case
he
was
not.
the
west
virginia
court
had
the
same
statute
before
it
that
we
have
here
today
and
it
held
that
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
sent
to
jail,
the
court
would
look
to
section
18
which
speaks
of
punishable
by
imprisonment
in
the
penitentiary
and
not
to
section
19.
it
would
not
regard
section
19
as
interpretive
of
--
of
section
18.
i
think
that
the
respondent's
brief
--
yes,
pages
17
and
18.
the
court
clearly
says
there's
not
doubt
about
it
that
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
west
virginia
law
are
contained
in
section
18
that
the
adjective
provisions,
the
procedural
provisions
are
contained
in
section
19.
section
18,
the
court
says
in
its
very
term,
it
is
clear
and
explicit.
it
governs
the
substantive
for
additional
sentences
and
so
on.
now,
this
is
one
case.
i
happen
to
disagree
with
the
results
the
interpretation
but
this
is
the
fact
of
which
this
court
must
record.
now,
the
--
we
now
have
the
--
a
second
case
which
is
the
matter
of
the
blankenship
case.
that's
discussed
on
page
12
of
our
brief.
the
blankenship
case
involved
the
problem
of
notice.
the
case
was
specifically
raised
under
this
statute
before
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals,
was
notice
require
to
the
defendant
--
to
the
--
to
the
criminal
before
the
information
could
be
filed
which
--
on
which
the
previous
convictions
were
based.
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
notice
was
not
required.
the
court's
attention
was
not
directed
to
the
matter
of
the
procedural
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
says,
it
was
concerned
specifically
with
the
problem
of
statutory
interpretation
of
the
west
virginia
law.
this
issue
so
far
as
we
can
see
a
constitution
issue
was
not
been
discussed,
but
it's
nevertheless,
these
are
the
two
cases
which
we
must
--
the
--
here
be
concerned.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
to
matter
of
identification
only.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
sir.
these
criminals
both
admit
that
they
were
the
people
identified
in
previous
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
have
a
feeling
here
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
mr.
justice
hughes
was
concerned
in
the
graham
case
with
issues,
which
turned
fundamentally
on
substantive
due
process
not
on
the
matter
of
the
procedural
issue
which
we're
raising
here.
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
there
was
ample
notice.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it's
one
of
the
questions
in
this
case
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
take
a
look
at
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
he
should
have
had
an
opportunity
(voice
overlap)
or
to
prepare.
oyler
should
have
had
an
opportunity
to
consult
with
his
attorney
regarding
the
prior
offenses.
is
it
true
that
under
west
virginia
law
in
fact
that
a
man
who's
been
put
on
probation
for
on
offense
and
that
he's
been
sent
to
the
--
to
the
industrial
school
for
a
second
and
third
offense
in
fact
under
west
virginia
law,
although,
he
was
charged
in
the
information
for
the
second
and
third
offenses
under
west
virginia
law,
it's
not
true
that
these
were
second
and
third
offenses
because
they
occurred
during
the
same
term
of
court,
the
west
virginia
law
regarded
it
as
a
single
evidence.
so
we
have
a
one
offense
for
the
theft
of
the
car
for
which
he
was
placed
on
probation,
the
other
on
which
he
was
sent
to
industrial
school.
now,
may
man
not
consult
with
his
attorney
or
if
not
the
attorney
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
investigate
what
the
law
was
or
he
not
merely
--
certainly
he
had
notice
in
the
sense
that
he
was
brought
up
before
the
court
and
he
was
told
that
the
recidivist
statute
would
be
--
was
going
to
be
applied
against
him,
but
did
he
have
an
opportunity
to
prepare
his
case?
mr.
david
ginsburg
to
prepare
his
defenses
to
bring
these
issues
before
him?
he
did
not.
mr.
david
ginsburg
precisely.
mr.
david
ginsburg
he
would
have
waved
of
his
right.
i
thought
it
might
have
regard
to
him
as
an
intelligent
lawyer
but
he
could
have
waved
his
rights
and
men
had
been
bound
by
this
before.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
the
man
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
no.
mr.
david
ginsburg
suppose
let's
take
some
of
these
possible
cases.
suppose
a
man
had
been
tried
before
and
convicted
but
it's
subsequently
found
that
he
was
innocent.
ought
not
he
then
to
be
able
to
come
before
the
court
and
argue,
that
true,
i
am
subject
to
the
statute.
i
am
the
man
who
was
involved,
but
in
fact,
i
did
not
convict
--
i
was
not
--
i
am
--
was
innocent
of
it.
or
suppose
he
had
been
pardon
by
the
government
in
the
case,
do
we
consider
this
as
part
of
the
recidivist
statute,
ought
not
judge
to
hear
argument
on
it
to
--
to
have
this
lawyer
--
to
have
the
lawyer
prepare
the
case,
to
argue
the
case
before
him?
supposed
it
had
been
a
misdemeanor
repeated
but
then
becomes
a
felony,
ought
he
not
been
to
be
able
to
bring
these
issues
to
the
court
and
have
the
court
decide
them,
instead
he
was
called
up,
put
before
the
court
ask,
“are
you
the
man?”
and
this
is
the
procedure
which
is
defended
by
the
state?
are
you
the
man?
if
he
is,
he
is
--
he
can
be
put
in
jail
for
life
and
he
was.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
sir,
i
think
it
gets
down
to
a
law,
which
does
not
provide
that
opportunity
for
a
lawyer.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
find
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
mr.
justice
i
find
the
law
clear
enough.

brought
before
it
and
he
was
in
this
case
and
upon
the
information
filed
by
the
prosecutes
--
prosecuting
attorney
that
was,
setting
forth
the
records
of
convictions
and
sentences
of
the
case
maybe
and
alleging
the
identity
of
the
prisoner
with
the
person
named
in
each,
shall
require
the
prisoner
to
say
whether
he
is
the
same
person
or
not.
if
he
says
he
is
not
or
remain
silent,
his
plea
or
the
fact
of
his
silence
shall
be
entered
of
record,
and
a
jury
shall
be
empaneled
to
inquire
whether
the
prisoner
is
the
same
person
mention
in
the
several
records.”
the
problem
is
one
of
identity.
if
the
jury
finds
that
he
is
not
the
same
person,
he
shall
be
sentenced
upon
the
charge
of
which
he
was
convicted
as
provided
law,
but
that
he
finds
that
he
is
the
same
or
after
the
unduly
caution
to
be
acknowledges
in
open
court
that
he
is
the
same
person,
the
court
shall
sentence
him.
this
is
the
procedure,
the
man
has
called
before
the
court
and
asked,
“are
you
the
person
who
was
convicted
before?”
if
he
is
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
may
not
hear
you.
mr.
david
ginsburg
and
that
is
exactly
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
that
is
what
i
believe
to
be
the
law
of
west
virginia
and
that
i
believe
is
the
case
that's
before
this
court.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
sir.
and
this
will,
perhaps,
lead
us
into
the
problem
of
the
discussion
of
equal
protection.
because
the
law
has
been
--
is
mandatory,
it's
very
hard
to
apply
these
laws.
it
leads
to
bargain
justice.
it's
so
simple
for
the
prosecuting
attorney
to
say
on
this
third
offense
that,
“if
you
plead
guilty
then
we
will
not
invoke
the
--
the
recidivist
statute,”
studies
have
been
made.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no.
we
have
no
cases
which
would
go
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
my
brother
mitchell
maybe
able
to
help
us
on
this
but
i'm
not
sufficient
and
familiar
with
it
to
be
able
to
assist
the
court
in
that
matter.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it's
the
court
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
there
have
been
--
there
are
decisions
cited
in
the
brief
in
which
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
this
statute
is
jurisdictional
--
this
statute
was
mandatory
and
the
provisions
--
the
procedure
at
jurisdictional,
it
must
be
very
closely
followed
where
the
court
--
where
the
trial
courts
have
--
have
gone
beyond
the
procedure
set
forth
in
section
19,
they
have
been
reversed.
what
the
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
this
is
what
i
believe
--
this
is
the
point
that
judge
hastie
made
in
collins
and
claudy
cited
in
the
--
in
the
brief.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes,
i
would
say
that
it
was
a
question
of
law
and
i
would
say
surely
that
the
court
ought
to
hear
argument
on
this,
that
there
ought
to
be
a
hearing,
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
on
the
application
of
the
recidivist
statute.
mr.
david
ginsburg
oh
the
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
but
the
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
purpose
of
the
caution,
the
language
of
the
statute
is
used
here,
and
as
indicated
in
the
commitment
order
in
the
oyler
case,
the
caution
is
to
tell
them
at,
that
if
he
does
identify
himself
as
the
person
who
was
before
convicted,
that
the
statute
will
be
invoked
against
him.
now,
in
this
case,
there's
no
question
of
--
of
identity,
there
isn't
error
in
the
information
in
one
case,
but
there
is
no
question
of
identity.
and
he
was
caution,
he
was
told
that,
“if
you
are
the
man
who
was
convicted
before,
then
you
will
be
subject
to
this
habitual
criminal
procedure”
and
he
got
up
and
said,
“i
am
the
man”.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
believe
that
--
i
certainly
i
would
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
i
would
also
ask
that
a
proper
procedure
there
means,
as
for
example
the
-
the
court
in
kansas.
a
case
also
cited
here,
the
man
was
given
ten
days
written
notice
that
the
habitual
criminal
statute
would
be
invoked
against
it.
in
collins
and
claudy,
and
this
point
which
is
we
have
now,
was
reserved
by
the
court
in
chandler
and
fretag,
the
--
involving
the
tennessee
statute.
a
tennessee
statute
which
did
not
provide
for
hearing
on
the
application
of
a
recidivist
statute,
but
that
statute
was
subsequently
amended.
three
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
had
this
problem
before
them.
all
of
them
have
said
that
there
should
be
ample
notice
and
that
there
should
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
application
of
the
recidivist
statute.
the
third
circuit,
the
sixth
and
the
tenth,
cases
are
cited
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
oh
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
wonder.
now,
just
take
the
case
of
the
crabtree.
crabtree
pleaded
guilty,
and
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
supporting
of
$35
check.
at
the
time
when
he
had
no
awareness,
that
the
habitual
criminal
statute
would
be
invoked
against
him
if
did
plead
guilty
and
that's
the
problem.
they
should
be
given
notice
and
advance
of
trial.
i'm
not
saying
certainly
that
there
should
be
–
it
should
be
contained
in
the
indictment.
it
need
not
be
contained
in
the
indictment,
but
just
as
the
state
of
kansas
has
worked
it
out
and
other
states
had
worked
it
out,
the
criminal
is
given
notice
before
he
pleads,
before
he
pleads.
mr.
david
ginsburg
to
--
before
he
pleads
to
the
principal
case
which
is
the
second
or
third
offense.
mr.
david
ginsburg
as
to
whether
the
habitual
criminal
procedure
would
be
invoked
against
him,
and
in
this
case.
crabtree
pleaded
guilty
to
a
$35,
forging
a
$35
check
which
subsequently
put
him
away
for
life
without
knowing
that
this
procedure
would
be
invoked
against
him
and
without
having
had
an
opportunity
for
hearing
on
the
application
of
that
procedure
and
to
me
this
seems
outrageous.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes,
now
i
understand
that.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
think
the
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
have
had
more
difficulty
mr.
justice
frankfurter
formulating
for
myself,
my
recommendations
to
the
court
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
this
case
than
i
have
with
analysis
of
the
case.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes.
mr.
david
ginsburg
we
are
attacking
--
we
are
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
this
prob
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
ginsburg
but
this
problem
mr.
justice
frankfurter
puts
up
before
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
they
had
already
held
as
west
virginia
has
held
that
notice
was
not
required,
but
judge
hastie's
opinion
came
down
in
collins
and
claudy
and
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
took
the
issue
off
again
and
found
that
impliedly
a
notice
was
required.
and
if
the
blank
--
if
this
court
concludes
that
the
blankenship
case,
the
west
virginia
highest
--
the
decision
in
west
virginia
which
interpreted
this
statute
to
mean
that
notice
is
not
required
that
if
the
blankenship
case
is
law
then
i
am
attacking
the
--
the
constitution
and
the
validity
of
this
statute.
mr.
david
ginsburg
but
if
they
can
--
and
as
i
believe
they
will
re-construe
this
provision
to
require
a
notice
then
i
believe
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
there
was
notice,
but
it's
a
technical
notice,
in
the
sense
that
they
had
--
it
wasn't
an
ample
notice
and
there
was
no
opportunity
to
be
heard.
you
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
are
re
--
are
reading
the
statute
in
one
--
one
way.
i
think
it
can
be
read
that
way.
i
would
hope
that
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia
would
read
it
that
way,
but
that's
not
what
the
court
has
done.
mr.
david
ginsburg
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
ginsburg
and
i
believe
to
be
the
law
in
the
state
of
west
virginia,
and
that
i
believe
is
what
actually
done
in
the
oyler
case.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
am
indeed
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
if
coupled
with
that
mr.
justice,
crabtree
was
given
an
opportunity
to
withdraw
his
plea
of
guilty.
if
he
was
given
notice
that
the
statute
--
the
habitual
procedure
would
be
applied
against
him
and
if
he
was
simultaneously
given
an
opportunity
with
--
to
withdraw
his
guilty
plea,
i
would
see
--
i
would
believe
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
that
is
my
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
that
is
my
position
and
i
believe
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
prior
to
--
prior
to
the
trial
on
the
principle
crime
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
prior
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
prior
to
plead.
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
prior
to
plead.
mr.
david
ginsburg
then
he
should
be
given
an
opportunity
as
i
recommend
to
this
court
to
withdraw
his
plea
of
guilty
and
i
believe
that
he
should
be
retried,
on
this
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
no.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
agree
with
graham
in
this
regard
and
i
don't
see
that
this
must
be
determined
or
shouldn't
be
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
because
unless
--
if
he
is
also
given
an
opportunity
to
withdraw
his
plea
of
guilty
when
he
has
knowledge
that
if
he
pleads
guilty
as
crabtree
did.
crabtree
should
not
have
been
forced
to
plea
--
to
plead
before
he
knew
that
if
he
pleaded
guilty
toward
this
--
to
a
forging
at
$35
check,
he
could
be
put
away
for
life.
mr.
david
ginsburg
in
my
view
in
the
case
of
crabtree
in
this
particular
proceeding,
i
believe
that
crabtree
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
withdraw
his
plea
and
that
he
should
be
retried
if
he
so
chooses.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
in
this
kind
of
case
where
man
has
received
the
jury
trial
on
the
principle
crime
as
he
no
reason
whatever
to
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
certainly,
where
a
man
has
pleaded
guilty
on
the
application
and
if
his
plea
will
result
in
the
application
of
the
recidivist
statute
and
a
life
sentence.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
sir.
it's
not
certain
--
not
necessary
as
graham
--
graham
points
out
for
the
--
for
the
recidivist
aspect
to
go
before
it.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no.
this
is
not
my
position.
and
--
and
think
it
formulates
it
in
one
way
that
it
can
be,
but
i
see
no
reason
in
the
nature
of
things
why
a
--
why
due
process
shouldn't
permit
this
man
to
be
apprised
that
he
has,
that
the
statute
is
going
to
be
applied
against
them
before
he
pleads.
mr.
david
ginsburg
before
man
pleads
and
there
are
many
things
in
a
--
as
one
sees
in
the
criminal
court
that
makes
the
man
plea
--
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty.
it
maybe
that
he
--
his
talk
with
the
prosecuting
attorney,
as
we
saw
in
one
case
which
i've
cited
here
in
the
johnson
case,
led
him
to
believe
that
there
would
be
a
certain
type
of
sentence
and
he
pleaded
guilty.
that
is
the
way
justice
is
administered
in
the
--
in
the
courts
--
in
the
states
courts.
why
should
he
not
be
given
an
opportunity
to
know
what
laws
to
be
invoked
against
him
before
he
pleads?
mr.
david
ginsburg
it's
one
way
of
putting
it
sir
and
i
certainly
believe
that
a
fair
criminal
procedure
would
require
this
man
to
be
notified
in
advance
of
his
plea
that
he
has
--
that
this
statute
will
be
invoked
against
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
agree.
and
it's
--
and
i
agree
with
that
aspect
of
the
state
--
of
the
procedure
in
west
virginia
in
the
change,
that
is
that
the
--
it's
no
longer
to
contain
in
the
indictment,
but
he
should
be
given
notice.
there's
one
other
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
in
the
case
of
crabtree.
mr.
david
ginsburg
and
to
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
on
the
application
of
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
that's
exactly
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes,
and
without
any
doubt.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i'm
not
sure
sir
as
i've
--
let
me
read
to
you
a
paragraph
from
graham
from
mr.
justice
hughes's
opinion.
full
opportunity,
he
said,
was
accorded
to
the
prisoner
to
meet
the
allegation
of
the
former
conviction.
plainly,
the
statute
contemplated
that
valid
conviction
which
had
not
been
set
aside
or
the
consequences
of
which
had
not
been
removed
by
absolute
pardon
which
is
this
particular
case,
nor
question
--
no
question
as
this
can
be
raised
here,
for
the
prisoner
in
no
way
sought
to
contest
the
validity
or
unimpaired
character
of
former
judges
repeated
that
he
was
not
the
person
who
has
thus
been
convicted.
in
graham,
the
man
contested
the
fact
that
he
was
the
same
man.
he
was
given
a
jury
trial
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
the
same
man
and
he
was
held
by
the
jury
to
be
the
same
man.
i
don't
think
that
graham
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
that's
was
the
exactly
the
--
that
was
the
question
that
he
thought
was
his
defense.
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
see
how
the
lawyer
really
could
have
opened
his
mouth
then
--
kept
it
open
under
the
statute.
mr.
david
ginsburg
there
is
another
aspect
in
the
sense
procedural
due
process
has
over
waited
here
and
that's
the
--
the
problem
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
under
a
statute
presumed
to
be
a
mandatory
statute.
you'll
find
in
the
record
a
mass
of
data,
accumulated
as
to
show
how
this
law
has
been
applied
in
the
state
of
west
virginia,
and
not
only
in
the
states
of
west
virginia
but
in
taylor
county
where
in
the
case
of
oyler
and
the
other
county
in
the
case
crabtree.
983
men,
during
a
15-year
period
were
subject
to
this
recidivist
statute.
of
those
9
--
983,
79
were
sentenced
under
the
recidivist
statute,
904
went
free.
this
is
an
extra
ordinary
thing
under
a
statute
presumed
to
be
and
criticized
for
being,
mandatory
in
application.
one
out
of
11
men
and
my
(inaudible)
indicates
that
it's
only
one
out
11
men
were
put
in
--
were
put
away
under
the
recidivist
statute
under
a
statute
presumed
to
be
mandatory.
at
the
state
--
the
legislature
west
virginia
has
looked
in
to
the
matter,
they
commissioned
professor
brown
of
the
west
virginia
university
law
school
to
examine
the
matter.
brown
--
i
preferred
to
all
of
these
details
in
the
brief,
brown
came
out
with
the
final
result
that
this
is
one
the
most
rigid
laws
in
the
country
that
has
consequence
of
its
rigidity,
it
has
been
disregarded
in
practice.
it
has
in
effect
been
administered
by
whom,
not
the
courts.
it's
been
administered
by
the
county
prosecuting
attorneys.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
david
ginsburg
you'll
notice
that
the
--
the
statistical
data
is
all
contain
--
it
was
contained
--
was
filed
with
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals.
it
was
in
the
habeas
corpus
petition,
is
--
it's
before
this
court
here.
now,
this
--
the
exact
statistical
material
which
is
contained
here
was
also
referred
to
by
professor
brown
in
his
own
study
which
--
which
the
court
i
presume
can
take
judicial
notice.
now,
that
the
law's
mandatory
was
unquestioned
and
it's
equally
unquestioned.
i
submit
that
has
been
disregarded
in
practice
and
if
90%
of
the
people
subject
to
the
recidivist
statute
go
free
and
only
10%
are
subjected
it,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
it
has
in
this
case
a
significant
problem
of
the
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
the
situation
in
the
state
is
notorious
and
i
believe
that
in
practice,
it's
really
outrageous.
mr.
david
ginsburg
in
practice,
it
isn't
mandatory
and
this
law
ought
to
be
amended
if
it
isn't.
but
if
--
but
the
prosecuting
attorney's
for
the
counties
ought
not
to
be
the
once
to
determine
the
application
of
the
statute
which
on
its
face
it's
regard
as
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
it
must
mean.
it
does
mean.
mr.
david
ginsburg
but
they
do
not
bring
it
the
attention
of
courts.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no.
i've
confined
no
evidence
whatever
your
honor
that
the
courts
have
disregarded
an
information
filed
by
a
prosecuting
attorney,
asserting
the
application
of
the
recidivist
statute
would
be
an
unbelievable
thing.
mr.
david
ginsburg
and
it's
also
the
language
of
the
statute
in
the
case
of
the
warden.
mr.
david
ginsburg
many
states
whereas
permissive.
mr.
david
ginsburg
much
more
usual.
mr.
david
ginsburg
in
disregard
of
the
--
of
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
ginsburg
an
equal
protection
probably
now.
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
here
is
the
man
--
is
this
not
the
problem
before
the
court
in
ever
case
where
an
equal
protection
is
asserted
to
be
denied?
here
a
criminal
in
jail,
79
out
of
983.
904
have
gone
free
so
far
as
concerns
the
statute.
the
79
have
been
put
away
on
what
basis,
who
was
making
the
law?
this
--
these
prosecuting
attorneys
are
making
the
law
in
the
state
of
west
virginia.
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
there
are
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
--
the
date
is
set
forth
in
the
record
sir
and
i
will
arrest
on
that.
it's
very
clear
that
they
did
know,
they
do
know
and
it's
very
clear
that
this
is
a
problem
to
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
this
problem
has
not
been
--
the
problem
of
equal
protection
was
asserted,
was
allege
was
contained
in
the
habeas
corpus
application
which
was
submitted
to
the
supreme
court,
but
there
was
no
opinion.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
sir.
i
--well,
just
one
word
that
it's
not
--
i'm
not
asserting
here
that
these
men
will
go
free
that
is
at
either
due
process
has
been
denied
here,
procedural
due
process
or
equal
protection.
what
well
happen
then
is
that
these
men
will
be
resentenced
by
the
trial
court
for
the
original
crimes,
in
the
one
case
for
second
degree
murder
and
the
other
case
for
the
crime
of
forgery.
it's
not
that
they
will
go
free.
the
problem
is
the
enhanced
punishment
by
reason
of
the
application
of
the
recidivist
statute.
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
in
the
case
of
oyler.
oyler
said
that
i
should
have
been
permitted
to
tell
the
trial
court
that
i
was
never
in
the
penitentiary
before.
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
is,
because
in
that
case
--
you
see,
there
is
a
distinction
in
my
mind
of
court
between
a
jail
and
the
--
and
a
reformatory.
and
the
one
came
that
under
the
law
of
west
virginia
reformatory
is
not
even
the
penal
institution
even
tough
confinement
is
involuntary.
the
cases
are
collected
in
the
brief
and
i
should
think
that
the
matter
of
this
kind
would
be
argued
before
the
court.
that
--
i
can
concede.
you
see
in
the
johnson
case
that
a
jail
penitentiary
--
a
county
jail
is
contest
over
the
states
penitentiary
could
be
assimilated.
but
to
assimilate
a
--
is
there
--
when
a
man,
let's
say
right
--
child
is
sent
to
a
--
young
man
sent
a
reformatory
school,
does
that
to
be
simulated
to
the
penitentiary?
mr.
david
ginsburg
john
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
skeen
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
--
the
warden
at
that
time.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
agree
and
i
--
i
said
at
the
time
that
during
my
argument,
i
believe
that
was
a
wrong
result,
but
i
believe
--
and
i
believe
they
should
have
argued
before
them
the
--
this
issue,
that
issue
or
issues
of
this
kind.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no.
oyler
of
course
raises
the
problem
of
a
--
i
mean
under
the
statute?
mr.
david
ginsburg
that
is
the
issue
which
oyler
presently
asserts
he
could
have
raised
under
the
statute.
mr.
david
ginsburg
crabtree
points
to
errors
in
the
information.
the
error
between
--
yakima
and
walla
walla.
and
--
but
both
raise
--
the
men
raised
of
course
what
i
believe
to
be
these
great
constitutional
questions.
mr.
david
ginsburg
certainly
procedure
in
due
process
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes.
well
i've
--
it's
not
conceivable
to
me
that
they
would
--
could
not
raise
as
a
federal
matter
in
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
alleging
the
invalidity
of
the
statute,
because
the
statute
denies
them
the
opportunity
--
the
ample
notice
and
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
on
these
issues.
mr.
david
ginsburg
could
conceivably.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes.
mr.
david
ginsburg
your
suggestion
sir,
bear
on
the
issue
of
harmless
error,
that
there
maybe
error
in
the
record
by
it's
harmless.
my
point
is
that
they
should
have
had
an
opportunity
to
argue
to
the
court
what
the
merits
of
those
issues
were.
and
it's
the
lack
of
opportunity
to
reach
the
court,
to
discuss
the
matter
with
the
court
that
i'm
complaining
about
here
and
i
believe
that
that's
the
essential
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
david
ginsburg
thank
you
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i'd
be
very
brief.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
certain
questions
were
asked
which
i
may
be
able
to
answer,
one
having
to
do
with
the
brown
study.
the
question
was
asked
whether
he
had
dealt
with
this
problem
of
bargain
justice
and
the
two
paragraphs
which
i
regarded
as
relevant
in
this
connection
are
quoted
on
page
21
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
brown
says
that
in
view
of
these
figures,
the
statistical
data
which
contained
in
these
records,
the
records
before
this
court,
on
these
cases,
it
is
to
see
why
the
few
prisoners
who
have
been
sentenced
for
life
imprisonment
under
our
habitual
criminal
law
feel
that
they
have
been
discriminated
against.
this
is
one
of
the
chief
complaints
against
west
virginia's
habitual
criminal
law.
of
course,
the
reason
the
law
was
imposed
in
many
cases
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
person
plead
guilty
to
the
present
charge
in
consideration
of
the
law
not
being
imposed.
bargain
justice
enters
the
picture
and
the
record
doesn't
show
the
whole
picture
insofar
as
the
part
played
by
the
habitual
criminal
law
in
our
system
of
criminal
justice
concerned.
question
was
asked
regarding
the
nature
of
the
statistical
data
whether
it
is
broken
down
by
county
and
so
on.
those
data
are
contained
in
the
record
in
this
case.
in
the
oyler
case
in
pages
37,
about
20
pages
going
on,
they
identify
the
prisoner,
they
identify
the
county,
the
number
of
prior
convictions
and
the
sentences
which
were
imposed.
there's
a
recapitulation
by
county
on
page
59
of
the
oyler
record.
question
was
further
asked
whether
what
action
was
taken
by
the
state
legislature.
in
the
oyler
record
on
page
36,
there
is
the
statement,
this
document
was
offered
to
the
state
legislature
in
1957
and
one
house
voted
98
to
2
in
favor
of
abolishing,
amending
or
correcting
the
habitual
criminal
statute
that
the
issue
was
not
pursuant
to
a
crime
(inaudible).
i
think
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
not
to
my
knowledge
sir
but
perhaps
in
the
data
which
the
attorney
general's
office
will
supply,
we'll
find
the
answer
but
in
the
published
material
there
is
no
answer
to
that
question
as
i've
seen
it.
reference
was
made
to
the
case
of
collins
and
claudy,
this
was
judge
hastie's
opinion
of
the
third
circuit
and
it
was
that
opinion
which
led
to
the
state
of
pennsylvania
to
reverse
itself
on
this
issue
of
notice.
it
is
quite
true
as
the
--
my
brother
mitchell
indicates
in
collins
and
claudy,
there
was
no
notice
of
any
kind
to
the
prisoner
that
he
was
being
dealt
with
as
a
habitual
offender.
judge
hastie's
reply
there
was
as
follows,
“we
cannot
see
how
any
subsequent
showing
that
the
accused
did
not
have
a
good
defense
can
excuse
the
failure
to
found
one
part
of
the
sentence,
it's
more
than
the
other
from
the
normally
prerequisite
procedure
of
notice
and
hearing.
we
are
satisfied,”
he
says,
“that
fundamental
fairness
and
judicial
procedure
required
the
court
impose
an
enhanced
penalty
only
upon
the
basis
of
a
supporting
judicial
determination
of
the
essential
facts
made
after
the
defendant
has
been
informed
of
and
heard
upon
the
issue
of
recidivism.
that
decision
led
to
the
state
of
pennsylvania
to
reverse
itself.
the
state
had
had
decision
in
effect
similar
to
the
one
in
the
blankenship
case
here
in
west
virginia
which
says
that
no
notice
is
required,
so
also
pennsylvania
had
concluded
that
no
notice
was
required.
following
collins
and
claudy,
however,
benzing
and
myers
that's
referred
to
in
the
brief,
there
was
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
seeking
release
from
the
pennsylvania
state
penitentiary.
benzing
had
been
convicted
of
voluntary
manslaughter
and
there
had
been
an
enhanced
punishment.
he
was
told
at
the
time
of
sentence
just
as
ordering
peremptory
were
told
here
that
the
habitual
criminal
act
was
being
invoked
but
he
was
not
told
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
and
time
to
prepare.
it
was
held
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
that
although
the
act
doesn't
in
terms
provide
for
notice
or
hearing
to
avoid
constitutional
problems,
the
act
would
be
reinterpreted.
and
it's
shown
there
as
here
that
neither
the
petitioner
nor
the
counsel
objected
when
sentence
in
that
case
was
doubled
and
the
judge
did
not
inform
benzing
that
he
had
a
right
to
hearings.
it
was
held
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
that
there
was
no
waiver
when
the
petitioner
did
not
know
that
he
had
any
right.
he
was
not
released
at
courts,
it
was
sent
back
for
re-sentencing
and
so
also
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
in
the
cases
here.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i'm
afraid
i
don't
follow
your
question
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
david
ginsburg
you
were
making
that
assumption
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes.
in
the
oyler
case
where
he
had
a
trial?
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
would
say
--
i
recognize
the
possibility
that
counsel
may
waive
rights.
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
anywhere
close
to
the
fact
of
what
actually
took
place
in
oyler
but
i
do
believe
on
these
assumptions
that
i
believe
counsel
could
waive
his
rights.
mr.
david
ginsburg
what
actually
happened
in
oyler
was
that
after
the
trial
and
after
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
denied,
this
information
was
brought
before
the
court.
i
agree
with
my
brother
mitchell
that
the
law
has
understood,
the
law
as
written
provides
that
you
may
contest
the
issue
of
identification
but
that's
all
you
can
do.
i
don't
believe
that
he
waived
any
rights
which
he
didn't
have.
he
didn't
have
a
right
to
raise
this
in
oyler
and
he
didn't.
i
don't
believe
either
counsel
or
that
counsel
was
culpable
in
that
case.
mr.
david
ginsburg
we
stand
on
the
statute
and
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes,
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
an
issue
in
this
case,
exactly.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
and
i
believe
the
court
will
find
that
there
are
numerous
decisions
cited
in
both
briefs
which
we
are
in
agreement
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
law
in
the
state
of
west
virginia.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
cannot
speak
of
course
for
mr.
mitchell.
within
my
limited
knowledge
of
what
the
law
is
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
think
i
do,
mr.
justice
harlan.
my
answer
i
think
was
then
that
he
would
have
the
power
to
grant
it
but
the
question
that
was
asked,
what
good
would
it
do
(inaudible)
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes,
and
he
would
have
the
power
to
grant
a
continuance.
mr.
david
ginsburg
that's
right
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
by
that
you
mean,
can't
the
law
of
west
virginia
--
may
west
virginia
do
what
it
has
done
in
this
case,
that
is
to
say
on
the
assumption
made
by
mr.
mitchell
that
he
has
said
it's
possible
that
west
virginia,
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
received
these
applications
for
certiorari,
for
habeas
corpus,
they
examined
it.
they
also
examined
the
law
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
they
concluded
that
this
man
was
guilty
of
felonies
punishable
by
imprisonment
in
the
penitentiary
under
the
law
of
west
pennsylvania
and
then
denied
the
petitions
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
and
i
would
concede
that
if
that
were
done,
so
far
as
concerns
that
particular
aspect
of
the
case
without
reference
either
to
notice
or
to
equal
protection,
i
would
regard
that
as
sufficient
under
the
law.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
would
be
a
curious
practice
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
have
a
man
in
jail
under
a
life
sentence
and
then
say
to
him
that
you
have
the
right
to
test
this,
the
notice
in
hearing
which
we
are
giving
you
is
a
notice
and
hearing
to
file
a
petition
for
an
application
for
habeas
corpus.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
sir.
that
--
this
means
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
there
were
983
on
this
--
its
page
59,
there
were
983
prisoners
identified
by
name
who
were
subject
to
the
recidivist
statute
and
who
could
have
been
imprisoned
for
life.
of
these
983,
only
79
were
in
fact
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
although
the
statute
has
indicated
is
mandatory.
904
were
imprisoned
but
only
on
the
last
offense.
mr.
david
ginsburg
precisely.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
sir.
those
are
large
counties
and
i
will
not
characterize
the
state
of
--
the
law
observance
in
them.
mr.
david
ginsburg
cabell,
that's
where
i
come
from
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
(inaudible)
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
ohio.
