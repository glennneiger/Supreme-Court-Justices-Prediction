mr.
george
h.
mitchell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsels
for
petitioners
have
stated
the
fact
substantially.
petitioner
oyler
was
indicted
for
murder
by
the
grand
juries
of
the
circuit
court
of
taylor
county
west
virginia
at
it's
jan
--
january
1953
term,
he
was
arraigned
and
as
his
request
court-appointed
counsel
to
assist
him
in
his
the
defense.
he
then
entered
the
plea
of
not
guilty
and
his
case
was
sent
for
trial.
the
trial
was
held
and
the
jury
found
him
guilty
of
murder
in
the
second
degree.
at
that
time,
it's
pointed
out
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
here
moved
the
court
to
set
aside
the
verdict
and
grant
new
trial,
the
court
during
that
time
for
counsel
to
assign
his
ground
in
support
of
the
motion.
approximately
one
week
later
after
the
verdict
of
the
jury
was
received,
the
court
overruled
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
at
that
time,
(inaudible)
the
prosecuting
attorney
then
counted
that
information,
set
and
forth
in
writ
--
this
information
was
in
writ,
they
filed
a
writ,
set
and
forth
three
previews
felony
convictions
of
petition
--
petitioner
oyler
in
the
court
for
(inaudible)
session
of
the
piece
in
the
county
of
bedford,
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania,
on
the
charge
of
(inaudible)
larceny
of
automobile,
breaking
and
entering
burglary.
the
order
of
commitment
in
connection
with
petitioner
oyler
states
that
after
being
duly
cautioned
as
to
the
effect
thereof,
he
acknowledged
in
open
court
that
he
was
the
same
person
named
in
the
information.
and
thereupon,
the
court
proceeded
on
the
--
on
the
habitual
criminal
statute
to
sentence
the
petitioner
oyler
to
confinement
in
the
--
in
the
penitentiary
of
the
state
for
life.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
under
our
statute
--
the
--
the
prisoner
given
opportunity,
he
is
duly
caution
as
to
the
effect
of
saying
that
he
is
the
same
person.
and
the
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
and
--
if
he
says
that
he
is
not
the
same
person,
a
jury
must
be
empanelled
to
try
the
question
of
identity
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
is
the
same
person.
and
if
he
acknowledges
after
being
duly
cautioned,
the
court
sentences
him.
now
is
practice
then
a
question
has
been
raised
and
continue
to
say
have
been
granted.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
continue
to
say
have
been
granted
it
so
that
this
question
can
be
determined.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
identity.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
he
can
raise
those
questions.
if
he
didn't
--
well,
let's
go
back,
if
he
denied
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
and
the
state
must
then
put
on
evidence.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes,
he
could
raise
those
issues.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
then
--
the
court
has
--
not
rules
specifically
on
that.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
and
we
have
observed
it
in
practice.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
it
had
been
observed
in
practice
that
you
can
raise
any
question
that
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
conviction
is
proper
one
to
sustain
the
application
of
the
habitual
criminal
law.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
we
have
no
specific
statute
on
that
sir.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
(voice
overlap)
very
infrequently.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
infrequently.
it's
not
been
frequent.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
i
have
observed
several
in
the
--
in
immediate
court
into
north
county
where
it
has
been
raised
and
if
--
the
prisoner
was
permitted
to
show
this
discrepancy
or
whatever
merit
was
that
would
show
that
he
--
the
conviction
that
was
being
set
forth
was
not
a
proper
one
or
application
under
habitual
criminal
statute.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
no
sir,
they're
not
reported.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
on
that
question,
no
sir.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
no
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
do
not.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
not
and
think
of
no
--
not
in
publish
to
that
effect.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes
sir.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
this
is
my
fifth
year.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes,
sir,
i
was
in
practice
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
mostly,
always.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
it
just
went
on
and
my
record
has
been
in
a
craft.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that's
true
sir.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that's
true.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
mr.
bryant.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
no
sir.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
it's
been
pointed
out,
petitioner
crabtree
was
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
of
lincoln
county
west
virginia
for
the
offense
of
forging
a
$35
check.
he
was
arraigned
and
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
and
then
one
--
perhaps
in
one
week
later,
the
prosecuting
attorney
filed
an
information
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all
and
i'd
like
to
say
that
i
don't
want
to
give
the
impression
that
i'm
attempting
to
read
something
into
the
statute
that
does
not
exist.
i
agree
fully
with
the
holding
in
the
graham
case
that
the
proceedings
under
the
statute
are
for
identification
only
and
i
know
of
no
reported
cases
in
west
virginia
where
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
defense,
especially
the
one
suggested
by
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
if
interposed
whether
it
should
be
considered
or
not
at
the
hearing.
i
know
of
no
reported
case
that
says
it
should
be
considered.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
as
i
just
stated,
i
know
of
--
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
know
of
no
cases,
reported
cases
in
west
virginia
where
they
have
allowed
a
defense
where
the
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
--
defense
was
interposed
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
--
and
it
was
tried
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
well,
under
the
statute,
i
think
it's
limited
to
a
question
of
identification
only
but
as
i
have
stated
before,
in
practice,
it's
possible
that
the
judge
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
conviction
was
proper,
it
might
here.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
the
jury
would
decide.
they
would
decide
whether
--
well,
they're
only
entitled
under
the
statute
to
decide
whether
he
is
the
person
named
in
the
information.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that's
all.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
it
would
be
a
question
of
admissibility
for
the
judge
and
i
would
think
that
under
the
statutory
proceeding,
it
would
not
be
a
question
for
the
jury
if
he
--
it
could
raise
the
question
on
a
writ
of
error
if
he
denied
the
right
to
interpose
this
defense
but
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
in
accord
with
the
graham
case
that
only
those
questions
that
go
to
the
identification
of
the
prisoner
are
the
ones
that
make
it
to
the
jury.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
i
think
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
at
this
particular
proceeding,
it
is
my
thought
and
i
think
that
the
law
of
west
virginia
is
that
this
limits
to
the
question
of
identification.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
under
the
statute,
mr.
justice,
if
he
says
that
he
is
not
the
person,
then
it's
incumbent
upon
the
state
to
put
on
evidence
to
the
effect
that
he
is
(inaudible).
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
i
think
then
we'd
come
on
the
writ
of
error.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes.
i
don't
think
he
could
raise
them
at
this
particular
proceeding.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
well
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
the
cases
that
we've
been
confronted
with
have
come
up
on
the
writ
of
--
applications
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
whether
this
--
where
there
was
any
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
conviction
was
one
that
was
sustained
the
additional
punishment
under
the
habitual
criminal
act.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
i
see
this.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that's
true.
i
stated
that
your
honor
and
i
also
stated
that
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
according
to
the
--
our
reported
cases,
the
only
question
that
can
be
raised
at
this
proceeding
is
the
question
of
identification.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
well,
the
circuit
court
sir.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that's
right
sir.
as
it
had
been
pointed
out
by
counsel
for
the
petitioners,
they
say
first
that
they
were
deprived
of
due
process
of
law
because
they
were
not
given
notice
that
an
information
would
be
presented
setting
forth
a
prior
felony
conviction.
our
supreme
court
of
appeals
has
held
in
state
against
blankenship,
a
1952
case
reported
in
137
west
virginia,
page
1,
that
in
as
much
as
a
procedures
set
forth
in
the
statute
does
not
constitute
a
trial
of
prior
offenses,
no
notice
is
required
before
presenting
the
bill
of
information
to
the
court.
as
i
understand
due
process,
the
primary
purpose
of
affording
a
defendant
notice
is
to
inform
him
of
the
charge
against
him,
and
to
give
him
a
reasonable
time
in
which
to
prepare
his
defense.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
such
a
reason
for
notice
does
not
exist
in
this
type
of
cases
wherein
we
are
concerned
with
the
application
of
the
habitual
criminal
act
because
this
is
not
an
information
of
an
offense
for
which
a
trial
has
to
be
had,
but
is
an
information
to
ascertain
the
fact
that
is
namely
that
the
prisoner
has
already
been
previously
convicted
of
offenses
and
this
fact
must
appear
either
by
his
own
confession
or
by
a
verdict
of
a
jury
before
he
can
be
sentenced
to
the
additional
punishment
prescribed
in
the
statute.
he's
not
sentenced
for
an
offense
distinct
from
the
one
from
which
he
has
been
tried,
but
the
only
question
is
whether
he
is
such
a
person
as
ought
to
be
sentenced
to
the
additional
punishment
and
in
that
relation,
we
compare
with
the
finding
in
the
graham
case
wherein
we
say
that
the
proceedings
under
the
statutes
are
for
identification
only.
they
are
clearly
not
for
the
establishment
of
guilt.
the
question
of
guilt
does
not
reopen
at
all
in
this
type
of
proceeding.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
we
would
like
to
show
that
no
formal
notice
was
such
is
given
for
trial.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
there's
no
formal
notice
such
as
a
notice
that
is
given
for
the
trial,
but
we
would
like
to
show
that
the
prisoner,
the
petitioners
were
amply
notified
that
they
were
being
proceeded
against
as
habitual
offenders
under
our
statute.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
no,
the
facts
was
--
there's
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
there's
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
what
i
think
i
said
mr.
justice
whittaker
is
that
they
were
amply
notified
that
they
were
being
proceeded
against
as
habitual
offenders.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
it
is
not
so
absurd
that
in
this
type
of
proceeding,
due
process
does
not
require
that
notice
be
given
in
the
same
form
as
in
a
trial
of
a
case.
in
relation
to
mr.
ginsburg's
position
there
that
notice
should
perhaps
be
given
prior
to
the
trial
of
the
case,
i
don't
see
how
it
would
be
feasible.
under
our
statute,
it
says
after
conviction,
immediately
after
conviction,
and
before
sentencing,
the
prosecuting
attorney
must
file
an
information
setting
forth
the
previous
convictions.
to
give
him
notice
that
he
would
be
almost
assumed
that
he
would
be
found
guilty,
he'd
be
convicted,
but
the
statute
anticipates
a
proceeding
after
conviction
and
before
sentence.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
their
procedure
sir?
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
no
sir,
no
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
it
is
our
position
that
it
does
not.
that
--
this
was
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that's
true
sir.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
a
contingence
could
be
had
if
it
did
not
extend
beyond
the
term.
the
statute
says
that
this
information
must
be
filed
after
verdict,
before
sentence
and
within
term,
within
the
same
term
of
court.
that's
perhaps
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
have
a
statute
that
gives
the
same
authority
to
the
warden.
if
a
prisoner
comes
there
and
has
not
been
sentenced
under
the
habitual
criminal
act
in
the
trial
court,
he
may
file
an
information
setting
forth
his
previous
convictions.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes
it
would
be
void
too.
it
will
be
also
if
this
particular
statute
as
we
are
discussing
now
would
be
considered
that
would
be
determined
to
be
unconstitutional
as
like
in
a
notice.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
well
it
wouldn't
do
him
any
good
if
the
question
was
any
other
than
--
any
other
than
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he's
the
same
person.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
in
both
of
these
cases
as
the
records
reveal
that
prisoners
upon
being
informed
of
their
prior
convictions
were
given
the
opportunity
to
say
whether
they
were
the
same
person
named
in
the
information
and
they
were
duly
cautioned
as
to
the
effect
of
admitting
their
identity,
nevertheless,
both
readily
admitted
that
they
were
the
same
persons
and
were
consequently
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
under
the
statute.
in
discussing
this
matter
of
notice
the
petitioners
in
their
brief
and
in
the
argument
have
relied
heavily
on
decisions
from
tennessee
and
from
the
third
circuit,
in
the
court
--
in
the
case
rhea
against
edwards,
a
tennessee
case,
which
mention
was
made
in
our
brief
on
page
6,
the
court
there
held
that
since
the
tennessee
habitual
criminal
act
as
interpreted
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court
did
not
require
that
notice
before
trial
be
given
a
defendant
who
is
to
be
sentenced
under
the
act
has
violated
the
due
process.
now
those
cases
can
be
readily
distinguished
from
the
cases
now
before
this
court.
as
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
under
the
tennessee
statute
that
was
in
effect
at
that
time
it
states
that
when
a
habitual
criminal
as
defined
in
section
1
of
this
act,
as
charged
by
presentment
on
indictment
by
the
commission
of
several
enumerated
felonies,
he
may
also
be
charged
in
this
same
indictment
with
being
a
habitual
criminal
as
defined
in
section
1
or
he
may
be
charged
only
with
the
commission
of
such
felony
but
in
either
case
shall
upon
conviction
be
sentenced
and
punished
as
a
habitual
criminal.
under
tennessee
statute,
it
was
possible
as
it
happened
in
the
mccummings
cited
in
our
brief,
it
is
possible
for
a
prisoner
to
go
to
trial
and
then
the
district
attorney
announced
at
the
trial
that
he
was
going
--
he
is
--
in
addition
to
being
tried
for
a
specified
felony,
that
he
would
also
be
tried
as
a
habitual
criminal.
now
under
the
west
virginia
statute
that's
not
possible.
our
proceeding
is
a
separate
proceeding
and
there's
no
question,
once
the
information
is
filed
as
to
what
the
proceeding
is
about
that
the
offender
is
to
be
punished
if
he
is
found
to
be
the
same
person
named
in
the
information
as
a
habitual
offender.
in
the
pennsylvania
case
cited
by
the
petitioner,
collins
against
claudy,
a
situation
existed
there
that
could
not
exist
in
our
statute.
in
that
particular
case,
collins
had
been
indicted
for
breaking
and
entering
a
store
and
stealing
certain
sum
of
money.
he
pleaded
guilty
and
was
sentenced
to
a
term
from
five
to
20
years.
his
sentenced
reheard.
the
court
sentenced
a
rehearing
that
it
was
pursuant
to
the
act
of
assembly
approved
april
29th,
1929.
this
was
a
reference
to
the
pennsylvania
habitual
criminal
act.
at
no
point
--
no
stage
during
the
proceeding
that
collins
knew
that
he
was
being
dealt
with
as
an
habitual
offender.
that
cannot
happen
once
again
as
i
pointed
out
because
on
our
statute,
the
ascertainment
whether
or
not
the
prisoner
here
is
a
habitual
offender.
it
is
done
in
a
separate
proceeding
and
is
not
done
along
with
the
trial
shall
we
say.
under
the
tennessee
statute
that
was
in
effect
then,
he
was
tried
at
the
same
time
for
being
a
habitual
criminal
and
for
the
felony
that
he
had
committed
and
the
jury,
the
same
jury
that
tried
him
for
the
offense
determined
whether
or
not
he
was
a
habitual
criminal.
that
cannot
happen
under
the
west
virginia
statute.
we
say
that
those
holdings
are
distinguishable
from
the
cases
now
before
this
court
for
that
reason
because
i
thought
that
the
west
virginia
procedure
provides
to
a
defendant
ample
notice
that
he
is
being
dealt
with
as
a
second
or
third
offender
as
the
case
may
be
and
he
has
opportunity,
sufficient
opportunity
to
contest
his
identity
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
that
person.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
mr.
justice
harlan
that
has
been
referred
to
by
mr.
ginsburg
in
connection
with
mr.
brown's
article,
they
call
it,
bargain
justice.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
well,
i
really
think
that
the
--
is
the
question
that
the
prisoners
make
and
his
attorney
must
make.
i
don't
think
that
that
should
enter
too
much
into
whether
or
not
this
procedure
here
is
proper
or
can
be
sustained.
maybe
i
don't
have
your
question
correctly.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
well
if
he
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
the
jury
still
found
him
guilty,
he
would
be
subjected
to
--
to
the
same
type
of
punishment
the
additional
penalty.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
are
you
asking
that
should
he
not
be
sentenced
as
a
habitual
criminal
in
the
lower
court,
in
the
trial
court,
could
he
not
when
he
enters
the
penitentiary
still
be
proceeded
against?
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
it
would
not
necessarily
work
because
he
could
be
proceeded
against
after
entering
the
penitentiary.
it's
discretionary
with
the
warden
under
the
statute
as
to
whether
or
not
he
wishes
to
file
this
information.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
if
those
were
the
facts,
it's
possible
that
you
would
have
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
the
--
in
these
two
cases
now
before
us,
the
petitioners
had
not
been
able
to
show
that
intentional
and
purposeful
discrimination.
they
cannot
get
--
they
cannot
get
themselves
into
the
class
that
you
are
describing
or
the
class
that
yick
wo
was
in
because
that
was
based
on
race.
chinese,
yick
wo
is
chinese
and
you
have
a
--
in
your
example
all
the
people
who
were
sentenced
were
those
who
pleaded
not
guilty
and
were
tried
under
but
our
petitioners
here
cannot
get
themselves
into
that
class.
they
cannot
show
the
intention
or
--
and
purpose
for
discrimination
necessary
to
show
an
evasion
of
the
equal
protection.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that
could
be
that
--
if
they
could
show
that
but
then
the
two
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes,
yes.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
i
don't
think
mr.
ginsburg
--
i
don't
know,
maybe
he
can
guess.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
you
would
have
a
--
that
type
of
case
that
--
but
then
these
--
in
these
two
particular
cases,
one
had
a
trial
and
one
pleaded
guilty
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
both
--
yes.
but
if
you
could
find
that
basis
for
a
class,
you
would
have
that
again
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
i
don't
think
they'd
be
able
to
substantiate
that
but
were
it
true,
i
think
you
could
find
that
basis
for
classification.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
no,
it
did
not
sir.
along
with
the
question
raised
by
mr.
chief
justice,
the
petitioners
contend
in
their
brief
and
in
their
petition
that
they
were
denied
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
equal
justice
by
the
state
of
west
virginia
because
the
state's
habitual
criminal
law
was
being
administered
by
an
unequal
hand
and
has
been
stated
here
this
morning,
in
support
of
this
allegation,
the
petitioner's
quote
extensively
from
several
studies
made
of
the
west
virginia
habitual
law
--
habitual
criminal
law
with
special
emphasis
being
placed
on
those
facts
that
tend
to
indicate
that
it's
somewhat
being
applied
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
now,
we
are
not
certain
how
accurate
the
surveys
are
but
we
are
--
and
we
do
say
that
the
allegations
contained
in
the
two
petitions
then
before
this
court
insufficient
in
showing
the
purposeful
and
intentional
discrimination
necessary
and
essential
to
show
an
invasion
of
the
constitutional
right
to
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
they
do
not
--
they
cannot
put
themselves
in
a
class
as
the
certain
group
of
people
being
discriminated
against.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
to
my
knowledge
there
has
been
--
a
bill
was
introduced
in
the
legislature
following
them
instead
but
not
by
the
committee,
it
was
not
a
committee-drawn
bill.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
no,
they
did
not
sir.
a
bill
was
introduced
but
it
was
not
by
--
they're
committed
by
one
of
the
delegates
and
did
not
pass.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that's
right.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
not
to
my
knowledge.
there
have
been
no
published
reports
following
that
study,
commenting
on
one
way
or
the
other
officially.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
i'm
not
able
to
say
exactly
but
it's
my
understanding
that
it
resulted
from
--
for
someone
risks
to
being
shown
among
the
prisoners
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
law
was
being
applied.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
someone
risks
or
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
but
it
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
but
that's
as
far
as
it's
got.
it
was
then
before
(inaudible).
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
it
was
to
make
it
discretionary
as
i
recall
it.
see,
it's
now
mandatory
with
the
prosecuting
attorney.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
no,
they
cannot,
sir.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
i
think
that
would
help
considerably.
as
i
state
it's
nothing
been
officially
--
no
official
view
has
been
taken
since
this
study.
no
one
has
shown
any
real
interest
in
amending
the
act
or
changing
it.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
22.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
they
all
have
criminal
jurisdiction
but
in
several
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
--
several
of
larger
counties
there
in
jury
courts
who
handle
only,
statutory
courts
--
of
courts
who
only
--
who
handle
only
criminal
cases.
that's
in
some
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
he's
on
appeal
that
--
there's
a
(inaudible)
in
the
larger
--
in
the
larger
counties,
they
may
have
separate
courts
who
have
inferior
courts,
who
handle
only
the
criminal
cases.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
well
all
the
judges
who
preside
over
these
courts.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes,
20
or
30.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
and
then
there
are
inferior
courts
who
--
they
have
the
power
to
decide.–
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes,
they
did.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
no,
i
don't
think
they
all
have
the
same
views.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that's
right.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that's
possible.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that's
true.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
you
would
also
run
into
this
problem
which
exists
now
as
far
as
the
prosecuting
attorneys
are
concerned,
the
statute
says
that
if
he
has
information,
if
he
has
knowledge
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
--
you
might
run
into
this
problem
which
we
all
--
which
we
have
now.
the
statute
says
if
he
has
knowledge
of
these
previous
convictions,
he
is,
he
shall
file
the
information.
whether
he
has
knowledge
or
not
is
often
--
is
often
hard
to
determine.
sometimes
he
does
not
have
it
and
most
of
the
prosecuting
attorneys
cooperate
with
the
criminal
identification
bureau
of
the
state
police
and
they
provide,
they
can
provide
them,
if
they
have
the
information
in
this
--
in
previous
offenses.
then
too
the
requirement
in
the
statute
is
that
it
must
be
done
within
term.
if
it
so
happens
that
you
get
some
case
near
the
end
of
the
term,
you
may
not
have
time
to
file
the
information,
get
the
necessary
information
to
file
it.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
in
the
smaller
counties,
you
will
find
that
your
prosecuting
attorneys
are
may
be
very
much
part
time
and
the
police
force
--
well
they
have
a
very
small
space.
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
one
has
to
write
us
about
getting
enough
money
to
have
a
station
there
or
anything
in
his
office.
it
depends
on
the
size
of
the
counties.
more
or
less,
in
smaller
counties,
they
do
have
a
difficulty
of
making
proper
investigations
and
actually
of
devoting
their
time
to
the
office.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
whether
he
broke
them,
i
don't
recall
exactly
as
to
whether
or
not
he
broke
them
down
to
filing
the
information
during
in
a
year
but
he
did
break
down
the
sentencing
under
our
habitual
criminal
act.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that
may
have
been
in
the
--
not
in
his
article.
it's
probably
in
his
research
but
it
was
not
in
his
article.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
it
was
probably
on
file
with
the
permission
in
this
committee.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
i
will
sir.
that's
--
whatever
information
is
available
to
the
--
that's
filed
with
the
committee,
that's
a
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
well,
it's
practically
impossible
under
our
interpretation
of
this
particular
proceeding.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
well
habeas
corpus
that's
the
way
it's
been
attacked
now
in
the
state
by
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
both
of
them
are.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
as
to
whether
or
not
the
judgment
was
void
that's
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that
the
judgment
is
void?
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
no,
they
are
not
raised
in
there.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
he
claims
as
i
guess
that
he
was
denied
due
process
because
he
was
not
allowed
to
show
that
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
--
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
it
is
here
in
habeas
corpus
and
he
made
his
application
in
the
supreme
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
if
the
judgment
is
--
if
the
finding
would
render
the
judgment
yes,
or
partially
void.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
well,
we
will
show
that
then,
they
were
not,
that
they
were
in
compliance
with
our
statute.
that
the
three
felonies
set
forth
in
the
indictment
were
of
such
a
nature
as
were
punishable
as
were
crimes
punishable
by
a
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
and
our
court
has
interpreted
the
statute
to
mean
regardless
of
where
you
serve
the
time
if
it
was
a
crime
punishable
by
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
was
one,
it
was
an
offense
sufficient
to
support
and
to
sustain
the
application
of
the
habitual
criminal
statute.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes,
he
would.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
i
think
he
is
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
you
mean
at
the
trial
court?
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
at
the
trial
court
level,
as
i
stated
before
the
question
has
never
been
decided
if
whether
defenses
as
one
as
you
are
speaking
of
is
interposed
whether
or
not
it
would
be
error
for
the
trial
judge
not
to
admit.
now
it's
being
reached
on
habeas
corpus
with
all
the
cases
at
which
i
have
knowledge
of.
if
there's
any
question
as
to
validity
of
the
previous
convictions
is
now
being
reached
by
proceedings
in
habeas
corpus.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
they
did.
they
said
that
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that's
what
they
said
in
the
petition.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that's
right
sir.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
yes.
they
filed
--
both
filed
petitions
in
the
supreme
court
of
appeals,
petitions
for
writs
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
west
virginia.
the
court
reviewed
the
petitions
and
denied
their
applications
without
hearing
and
without
an
opinion.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
i
think
our
supreme
court
in
reviewing
these
petitions
examined
the
pennsylvania
statutes
and
they
found
that
the
offenses,
the
crimes
therein
described
were
crimes
punishable
by
a
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
hence
pennsylvania
so
selected
to
punish
the
petitioner
in
their
manner.
larceny,
according
to
the
statute
is
a
felony
in
pennsylvania,
that
was
a
larceny
of
a
$1250
car.
burglary
was
made
a
felony
by
the
statute
in
pennsylvania
and
he
was
convicted
of
both
of
those
crimes
and
they
are
punishable
under
pennsylvania
statute
by
a
confinement
in
the
penitentiary.
however,
pennsylvania
has
this
other
statute
that
allows
certain
youthful
offenders
to
present
to
camp
hill
or
whatever
it
is,
an
industrial
school
in
pennsylvania
and
they
elected
to
send
him
there
rather
than
to
send
him
to
the
penitentiary.
our
supreme
court
in
the
case
already
referred
to
him,
state
ex
rel
johnson
against
skeen,
the
warden
has
interpreted
that
to
mean
that
the
convictions
are
convictions
for
crimes
punishable
by
sentence
to
the
penitentiary
and
it
doesn't
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
if
it
was
a
juvenile
proceeding,
that
was
a
yes,
they
could've
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
juvenile
proceeding
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
that's
right
sir.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
this
--
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
well,
this
is
what
i
meant
mr.
chief
justice.
when
these
petitions
were
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
for
--
they
were
application
for
writs
of
habeas
corpus
in
reviewing
the
petitions,
the
court
would
--
to
see
whether
they
had
probable
cause
to
grant
a
hearing
on
them
and
i
think
from
the
review
of
them,
they
ascertained
that
these
crimes
of
which
--
that
are
set
forth
in
his
petition
were
crimes
punishable
by
confinement
in
the
penitentiary.
therefore,
the
writ
will
be
denied
because
he
had
no
grounds
for
it.
mr.
george
h.
mitchell
i
think
if
--
in
his
petition,
he
set
forth
by
affidavit
the
other
evidence
from
the
cause
to
believe
that
he
was
proceeded
against
or
was
being
proceeded
against
unjustly
that
the
court
would
grant
him
a
hearing.
