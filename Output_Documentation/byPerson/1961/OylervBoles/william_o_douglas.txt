suppose
the
--
the
man
who's
up
under
the
statute
has
been
convicted,
say
three
times,
and
one
of
those
times
or
two
of
those
times
or
three
of
those
times,
he
did
not
have
a,
say
lawyer,
as
our
decision
in
betts
and
brady
requires
in
certain,
at
least
in
certain
types
of
cases,
would
that
be
triable
on
this
--
under
the
statute?
justice
william

(voice

--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
suppose
this,
and
suppose
you
were
there
representing
the
state
and
mr.
ginsburg
was
there
representing
this
man
and
mr.
ginsburg
steps
forward
and
offers
that
in
proof.
would
you
object
or
would
you
say
this
is
triable?
if
those
four
--
those
prior
three
convictions
were
all
voidable
or
unconstitutional
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
could
be
attacked
say
by
habeas
corpus
because
of
the
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right,
would
you
say
that
they
nevertheless
would
be
foreclosed
that
this
man
could
go
to
prison
for
life
on
the
basis
of
three
judgments
in
which
he
had
no
lawyer,
no
one
to
defend
him
and
constitutionally
was
entitled
to
a
lawyer
in
those
three
cases
or
in
one
of
those
three
cases
or
in
two
of
those
three
cases.
i
realize
that
isn't
quite
this
case
but
i
kind
of
get
your
idea
of
what
this
statute
does
and
does
not
do.
