there
any

perhaps
(inaudible)
of
your
points
under
mr.
stewart,
if
you
don't
mind
asking
me.
justice
john
m.

apparently,
from
this
order,
the
facts
that
you
just
raised
namely
that
he
was
not
in
probation
(inaudible)
in

order.
in

the

justice

well,

it's

said
he

he'd
be
placed
on
probation.
justice
john

i'm
looking
at
--
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i'm
looking
at
the
information
(voice

justice
john
m.

of
course
we
--
if
the
court
in
fact
did
have
the
information
(inaudible)
suggested
with
(inaudible)
by
its
interpretation
by
its

has

(inaudible)
ambiguity?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
know
how
it's
been
administered
in
practice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
isn't
quite
what
i
meant.
are
there
institutes
where
a
lawyer
has
brought
in
to
the
court
and
said,
“i
don't
know
have
any
issues
to
identity
and
(inaudible)
to
the
facts.
but
i
want
time
to
study
the
virginia
law.”
and
the
court
says,
“well,
i
can't
give
you
any
time
because
(inaudible)
on
the
statute.”
you
have
permitted
those?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
know
what
the
practice
has
been,
whether
(inaudible)
about
that
kind?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
a
--
it's
unusual
written
of
the
statute
(inaudible)
it
deprives
the
court
of
its
discretion
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
time
if
it's
asked.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
go
back
to
justice
whittaker's
question
and
to
get
clear
in
your
position.
take
the
crabtree
case,
whether
there
was
a
plea
of
guilty.
supposing
in
that
case,
crabtree
after
his
plea
but
before
sentencing,
given
10
days
notice
of
the
recidivist
charge,
would
you
still
claim
that
the
statute
was
--
and
there
was
an
unconstitutional
act
of
notice
because
the
notice
had
not
been
filed
--
had
been
given
him
before
the
plea?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
your
ultimate
position
is
that
the
notice
must
be
a
notice
prior
--
prior
to
trial
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
if
that
prior
to
trial
sentence,
that's
your
ultimate
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
prior
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
prior
to
the
trial
and
principle
case,
that's
your
ultimate
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
the
judge
have
granted
an
application?
did
he
have
power
to
grant
an
application
had
it
been
made
for
an
adjournment,
the
defendant
having
permitted
his
identity?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
think,
assuming
you
are
right
for
the
moment
that
notice
is
not
required
beyond
what
was
given
here
in
both
of
these
cases,
what
do
you
say
as
to
the
effect
of
that
procedure
on
the
question
of
inducing
pleas
of
guilty
by
people
who
have
before
them
the
prospect
of
the
recidivist
charge
which
they
know
about
but
which
the
state
did
does
not
notify
them
about
therefore
they
plea
in
order
to
hopefully
presumably
avoid
the
possibility
of
a
recidivist
charge
and
they
turn
out
to
be
wrong?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it's
just
a
question
of
bargain
and
maybe
no
negotiations
at
all.
the
man
knows
he's
possibly
faced
with
such
a
charge.
he
hopes
that
the
state
doesn't
know
about
it.
he
therefore
pleads
guilty.
he
had
the
notice
and
he
knew
that
he's
going
to
be
charged
anyway
he
might
not
be
in
trial.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see
you
might
have
some
bearing
as
to
whether
due
process
does
or
does
not
requiring
of
it.
if
the
absence
of
the
kind
of
notice
that
mr.
ginsburg
is
arguing
for
might
produce
the
kind
of
result
i've
indicated.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
true
or
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
assuming
that
the
statute
is
not
to
be
construed
as
limiting
the
power
of
the
judge
on
a
request
for
adjournment
that
had
been
made,
what
is
your
answer
to
the
question
of
waiver,
a
suggestion
of
waiver
in
the
oyler
case,
the
counsel's
failure,
waiver
arising
from
the
counsel's
failure
to
ask
for
any
further
notice
or
adjournment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
question
is
that
assuming
that
if
a
request
by
counsel
had
been
made
for
additional
time
when
he
was
--
when
his
client
was
brought
into
court
in
oyler,
that
the
court
would
have
had
power
to
grant
an
adjournment,
grant
more
time.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
making
that
assumption,
what
answer
--
assuming
that
the
statute
cannot
be
construed,
should
not
be
construed
as
you
suggested
earlier
as
you
thought
it
might
be,
what
answer
have
you've
got
on
that
set
of
assumptions
to
the
waiver
point
in
the
oyler
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
enlighten
me
as
to
why
you
don't
think
it's
any
way
near
what
happened
in
oyler,
that's
all
i'd
like
to
know.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
you
stand
on
the
statute,
don't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
if
you're
mistaken
on
the
statute
or
one
doesn't
agree
with
you
on
the
statute,
is
there
any
other
answer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
perhaps
--
excuse
me,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
mr.
mitchell
and
to
my
point
of
view,
this
is
important,
i
had
understood
him
to
say
that
notwithstanding
the
admission
of
identification
and
notwithstanding
that
the
statute
permits
only
the
issue
of
identification,
notwithstanding
both
those
considerations
that
if
a
request
for
an
adjournment
had
been
made,
it
would've
been
honored
and
the
court
had
power
to
honor
it.
now
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
that.
if
i
am
wrong
i'd
like
to
be
corrected.
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps
the
chief
justice
would
allow
mr.
mitchell
to
answer
that
because
i
think
it's
important.
do
you
understand
my
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
a
different
question.
my
question
was
