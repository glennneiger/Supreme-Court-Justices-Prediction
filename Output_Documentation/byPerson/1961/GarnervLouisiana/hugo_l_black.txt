justice

black
when
ordered
to
leave
by
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
a
dispute
in
the
record
as
to
whether
or
not
he
did
direct
--
he
and
his
employees
did
direct
the
arrest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
supreme
court
did
not
construe
it
as
constitutional
or
unconstitutional
as
applied,
did
it,
on
the
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
did
not
review
the
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
couldn't
review
the
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
if
it
was
going
back
to
the
language
of
the
act,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
sure
that
--
that
besides
the
questions
here
or
whether
the
question
is
here
in
this
way,
can
a
state
pass
a
law
of
its
own
which
forbids
people
to
be
in
--
on
a
property
owned
by
another
where
there
is
no
objection
raised
by
the
property
owner.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
disagree
with
him
about
de
facto?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
the
owner
had
indicated
and
shown
that
he
was
ordering
him
to
get
off
the
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
quite
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
quite
different.
they
would
not
be
given
service.
was
there
any
depravation
of
the
owner's
right
here
to
order
somebody
off
his
premises
and
he
did
not
want
on
his
premises?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
will
discuss
that
question
of
fact
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
the
owner
has
not
objected
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
court
could
have
taken
notice
of
that,
to
convict
somebody
of
a
crime
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
what
was
published
in
the
newspaper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh
what
i
--
what
i
meant
was,
are
you
saying
that
what
actually
took
place
in
that
store
is
a
matter
of
judicial
knowledge
to
be
inferred
from
the
newspapers
of
the
community?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
you
would
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
talking
about
the
result
of
the
demonstration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
are
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
now
arguing
on
the
basis
that
he
took
apparently
to
that
extent,
to
get
rid
of
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
store
and
that
to
me
raises
quite
a
different
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
of
course,
we
have
to
depend
on
the
record
as
to
whether
or
not
he
took
action
to
show,
direct
them
to
get
off
his
premises
on
where
the
state
came
to
back
not
its
own
purposes,
but
his
purpose
to
protect
his
business
with
people
he
didn't
want
with.
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
you
permit
me
to
say
right
there
that
i
think
you
are
raising
the
question
which
includes
two
things;
one
is
have
you
--
have
you
prosecuted
these
people
under
such
statute,
and
two
do
the
facts
sustain
what
you
are
saying?
that
would
seem
to
me
on
the
basis,
accepting
that
as
the
(inaudible)
per
se
whether
or
not
you
have
convicted
under
an
ordinance
which
prohibit
--
which
is
based
on
that
principle
of
law
for
this
and
number
two,
did
your
evidence
support
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that's
not
ordering
them
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
store
has
--
the
store
has
good
many
goods
in
it,
and
that
the
man,
they
might
be
perfectly
willing
to
sell
him
other
goods
just
he
didn't
mean
he
had
to
leave
the
building.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
insisting
that
that
means
then
he
found
(inaudible)
that
he
would
tell
him,
“you
get
out
of
this
part
of
the
store?”
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
your
argument
there
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
state
is
merely
protecting
the
right
which
you
said
they
do
have
a
right
to
protect,
and
that's
--
it's
on
the
argument,
the
right
of
an
owner
to
keep
people
off
of
his
premises
that
he
does
not
want,
i
would
suppose
if
you'd
have
little
difficultly
in
proving
that
fact
by
the
man
going
in
the
store,
and
rather
than
to
rest
it
on
ambiguous
farfetched
inferences,
if
a
man
strongly,
again,
he
doesn't
want
him
there,
and
tells
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
don't
have
any
statement
except
that
--
or
rather
train
of
inferences
in
this
case,
at
least,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
there
any
indication
here
that
this
man
wanted
his
fellow
to
get
out
of
his
store
because
he
didn't
want
to
sell
him
goods?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
trespass
statute
in
effect
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
raise
it
as.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
any
way,
they
didn't
use
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
moreover
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
moreover,
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wait
a
minute.
that
depends
on
whether
it
was
a
private
property
owned
or
(inaudible),
isn't
it?
why
you
--
you
--
you
moved
over
that
each
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
stayed
on
this
private
property.
who's
right
is
it
to
keep
it
private?
justice
hugo
l.
black
anybody
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
refused
who
to
give
possession?
did
he
ever
order
them
to
get
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
his
consent
or
over
his
objection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
do
condition
that
each
time
the
fact
that
he
got
the
right
to
say
what
he
wants
if
he's
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
owner
doesn't
object?
you
mean,
the
state
can
come
in
and
tell
him
he
can't
say
it
or
talk
on
that,
where
the
owner
objects
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
it
gets
back
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
might
make
someone
else
resent
what
they
are
saying
or
doing?
well,
could
you
--
even
if
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
even
if
you
assume
that
that
is
a
sufficient
ground
on
the
basis
that
you
could
show
somebody
might
object,
would
that
be
enough
to
just
--
justify
without
showing
that
your
beliefs
were
unable
to
stop
the
people
who
tried
to
prevent
a
man
from
doing
that
which
he
had
a
right
to
do?
which
would
come
first?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
argument
gets
back
each
time,
to
whether
they
--
your
law
prohibits
them
being
there
unless
the
owner
forbids
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
keeps
his
store
open.
but
suppose
he
wants
to
keep
his
store
opened
to
all
people
of
all
colors
because
he
wants
their
trade,
he's
not
willing
to
say,
“keep
out
of
here”
or
“you
get
out
of
here.”
does
the
state
have
a
right
to
come
in
and
take
his
place
and
forbid
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
under
the
foreseeable
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
because
i
have
an
idea
but
--
but
the
idea
is
a
little
different
in
what
you
said,
i'm
not
sure.
as
i
understand
it,
what
they
say
is
that
de
novo
examination
of
facts
speaking
in
the
sense
that
our
constitution
did
in
an
appellate
court,
reviewing
the
facts
to
determine
what
the
facts
are,
but
as
i
understand
your
court,
i
have
understood
it
that
way
heretofore,
it
will
look
at
the
facts
sufficiently
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
facts
there
show
as
what
they
call
a
matter
of
law,
a
situation
which
the
constitution
says
cannot
take
place
there
or
forbids.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
been
my
understanding
of
what
your
state
holds.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
does
not
mean
that
it
never
looks
at
the
facts
at
all.
it
won't
redetermine,
determine
guilt
or
innocence
or
to
upset
the
facts
under
the
--
that
they
have
held
to
exist,
but
it
will
look
at
them
in
--
look
at
them
in
connection
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
which
in
terms,
which
we
sometimes
review,
i
think,
would
mean
as
applied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
making
out
a
question
of
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
maybe
i'm
wrong
with
that.
