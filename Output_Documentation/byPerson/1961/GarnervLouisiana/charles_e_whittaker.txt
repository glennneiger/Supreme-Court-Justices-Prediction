justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
is
that
situation
now
mr.
greenberg
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
did
say
that
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
he
didn't
call
the
police
that
no
one
of
his
employees
called
the
police
as
far
as
he
knew
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
within
the
same
time,
would
you
then
have
say
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
court's
finding,
that
the
people
were
ordered
out
and
refused
to
go?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
was
thinking
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
when
ordered
to
leave
and
they
choose
to
go?
what
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
the
second
case
(inaudible)
was
not
--
that
the
petitioners
were
told
to
leave,
clearly
that
they
could
not
be
served.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
you
read
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
i
thought
this
(inaudible)
counter
to
be
served
for
colored
people,
asking
no
service.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
even
in
the
trespass
case,
if
i
come
in
to
your
store,
(inaudible)
a
breach
of
peace.
but
if
you
didn't
warn
me
off,
that's
another
case,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
for
me,
that
raised
this
question
whether
or
not
if
i
come
in
to
your
store
(inaudible)
and
i
refused
to
go,
(inaudible)
your
right
and
power
to
order
me
out,
that's
relevant
on
a
disturbance
of
the
peace
issue.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
until
you
order
me
out,
that's
the
trouble
you
--
of
this
case
from
my
standpoint.
you
have
invited
them
in
and
you've
never
ordered
me
out,
you've
never
cancelled
the
invitation.
and
i
don't
--
as
i
frankly
must
say,
see
the
substance
thereof
a
disturbance
in
the
peace.
now,
if
i
were
contesting
with
you,
you
had
the
right
to
order
me
out.
that
would
be
relevant.
now,
you've
said
many
times
that
these
people
had
no
right
to
(inaudible).
now,
we
should
make
that
clear
to
you
from
the
record,
where
it
is
that
they
had
no
right
to
do
that
if
the
invitation
was
cancelled?
