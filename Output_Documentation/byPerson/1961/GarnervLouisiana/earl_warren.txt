mr.
greenberg,
you
may
continue
your
arguments.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
in
existence
at
the
time
of
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
pertains
to
the
old
trespass
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
trespass
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
superior
testify?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
greenberg,
may
i
ask
you
for
it
is
your
position
in
these
cases
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
violation
of
this
particular
statute
and
therefore
the
case
comes
under
thompson
versus
louisville.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
first
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
does
come
within
the
louisville
--
the
thompson
versus
louisville,
would
that
not
be
dispositive
for
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ward?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
don't
have
a
trespass
law
here,
do
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they,
in
the
garner
case,
asked
to
leave
the
premises?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
get
in
it
from
the
record?

chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
disturbing
the
peace?
to
a
person
--
if
a
person
seeks
to
vindicate
his
constitutional
rights
in
that
--
is
that
disturbing
the
peace?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr
--
mr.
ward,
would
you
point
out
the
specific
plea,
the
language
that
you
relied
on
to
show
that
these
petitioners
admitted
they
were
there
for
an
unlawful
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
read
it
please,
to
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
let's
take
the
garner
case.
that's
the
first
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
read
the
rest
of
it,
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
there
any
intimation
in
there
that
they
were
doing
something
unlawful?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
were
--
what
--
what
are
the
words
that
admits
they're
doing
something
unlawful?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
didn't
have
any
facilities
in
this
place.
he
just
said
--
he
just
said
we
can't
serve
you
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
now
it's
that
requesting
them
to
leave?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
have
any
signs
in
the
store
indicating
it
was
segregated
and
that
he
didn't
want
any
--
any
of
that
kind
of
trade
at
that
particular
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
think
the
record
shows
were
not
--
at
least
in
some
of
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
there
was
such
knowledge
on
the
part
that
the
public
gain
from
--
from
a
sign
of
that
kind,
was
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
now,
would
you
say
that
if
a
man
just
--
suppose
the
man
have
the
practice
of
not
doing
any
business
with
negroes,
if
a
man
walked
into
the
store
and
offered
to
buy
something
and
he
said
the
owners
said,
“well
we
don't
serve
--
we
don't
serve
you”
and
he
loitered
there
a
little
while,
do
you
think
he
--
he
could
be
arrested
for
disturbing
the
peace
with
no
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
a
normal
course
of
business
went
and
bought
an
umbrella
there
just
before
he
sat
down.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ward,
in
some
communities,
church
congregations
have
the
custom
of
segregating.
suppose,
a
negro
walked
into
a
church
that
had
--
had
the
custom
of
segregating,
and
the
minister
merely
said
to
him,
“well,
our
practice
here
is
--
is
not
to
have
negroes.”
but
the
man
didn't
--
didn't
move
and
the
preacher
or
the
congregation
made
no
effort
to
remove
them
and
a
policeman
came
in
note
--
notice
that
he
went
in
and
the
policeman
came
in
and
arrested
him
for
being
in
there
and
praying,
would
it
be
any
different
from
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
not
--
i'm
with
--
yes,
we'll
take
the
garner
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
he
under
the
garner
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
the
question
you've
got
in
the
garner
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
would
it
--
well,
why
would
be
anymore
an
excess
of
authority
for
him
to
do
it
in
those
circumstances
than
in
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
proprietor
made
--
made
no
complaint
of
any
kind
to
the
police.
he
merely
told
these
people
that
we
can't
serve
you
here
and
there
was
no
recalcitrance.
there
were
no
--
no
back
talk,
there
were
no
argument
or
anything,
some
people
officer
saw
it
and
--
and
came
in,
and
arrested
him.
no,
how
would
that
be
different
from
the
church
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
get
the
first
part.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
isn't
in
your
case
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
let's
assume
that
it
is
in
the
record
and
let's
assume
that
it's
in
the
hypothetical
case
that
i
put,
would
there
be
any
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
officer
--
did
the
officer
say
in
these
cases
that
they
feared
violence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
in
the
record,
don't
they
say
that
they
did
it
--
they
arrested
them
just
because
they
were
sitting
in
a
place
that
white
people
were
supposed
to
occupy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
what
we're
governed
by,
what
their
statements
were?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
say
anything
to
the
contrary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where,
did
he
--
we'll
let's
see
what
he
says,
because
those
things
are
important
mr.
ward,
i
think
we
ought
to
point
them
out
as
we
go
along.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
we
go
along.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
anything
in
--
in
garner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
nobody
testified
there
was
any
fear
of
disturbance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
in
just
one
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
then
--
how
then
do
you
sustain
the
garner
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right,
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
we
concede
that,
but
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
garner
case
showing
that
the
police
officer
was
exercising
that
discretion
because
he
feared
that
violence
would
break
up?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
evidence
or
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
can't
point
it
out
per
se?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ward,
suppose
a
man
running
a
store
does
have
a
custom
of
segregation,
but
he
doesn't
want
to
offend
the
negroes
to
the
point
that
they
won't
come
in
to
his
store
and
buy
his
other
articles,
and
when
the
thing
of
this
kind
happens,
he
says,
“well,
it's
not
my
--
not
my
practice
or
not
my
custom
do
this,
but
i
don't
want
to
offend
these
people,
and
i'm
not
going
to
--
i'm
not
going
to
order
them
out
of
my
--
of
my
place.
i'll
just
tell
them
that
it
isn't
my
custom
to
--
to
serve
them.”
and
he
takes
that
attitude
and
objects
no
further
to
they're
being
there,
and
the
police
come
in,
there
being
no
disturbance
of
any
kind,
and
put
the
people
in
jail
for
disturbing
the
peace.
is
that
--
is
that
a
violation
of
the
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
garner
case,
yes,
but
you
defend
the
garner
case
very
strongly
and
i
just
want
to
know
how
you
do
it
and
that's
the
reason
why
i'm
asking
these
questions,
now,
isn't
that
the
garner
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
say
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there'd
be
that
two
inferences
that
can
equally
be
drawn,
one
of
them
with
guilt
and
one
of
them
of
innocence,
what
one
do
you
choose
in
your
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
innocence.
that
should
leave
out
the
other.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
one
that
--
isn't
there
another
one
where
he
didn't
--
where
it
was
some
truck
driver
who
called?
i
thought
that
was
in
one
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
take
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
your
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
--
your
arguments.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
greenberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
