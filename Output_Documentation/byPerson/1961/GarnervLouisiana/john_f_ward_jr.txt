mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors;
the
defendants
here
have
attempted
to
color
these
cases
entirely
in
terms
of
negro
versus
white
people,
and
to
raise
in
that
very
limited
context,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
police
power
of
the
city
of
baton
rouge
maybe
invoked
to
enforce
a
private
property
owner's
right
to
be
secured
in
his
property.
therefore
the
issue
actually
before
the
court
is
much
broader
as
stated
by
the
defendant
and
involves
the
basic
fundamental
issue
of
whether
or
not
in
our
country,
a
private
property
owner
still
has
the
right
to
admit
or
deny
access
to
his
property
or
to
restrict
in
some
fashion
the
use
of
that
property
for
any
reason
that
he
may
choose.
or
does
a
man,
by
entering
into
a
private
business
which
may
ultimately
result
in
a
gain
to
him
or
which
may
ultimately
result
in
a
total
loss
which
he
alone
must
bear
become
a
public
trust
open
to
anyone
whether
objectionable
to
him
or
not.
we
submit
that
he
still
possesses
the
right
to
chose
who
he
would
admit
to
his
place
of
business
and
whom
he
will
serve
and
as
just
as
other
citizens
he
has
the
right
to
call
upon
law
enforcement
officials
to
protect
his
rights.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
we
submit
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black
in
all
three
of
these
cases
you
have
an
objection
by
the
owner?
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
in
all
three
cases,
the
owner
indicated,
we
think
very
clearly
to
these
persons
that
they
would
not
be
given
service
in
this
particular
area
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
--
of
his
property.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
think
the
right
to
order
all
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
sir,
if
i
understand
your
question,
may
the
state
adopt
the
law
which
requires
segregation
on
private
premises,
no
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
if
your
question
is
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
if
he
means
can
the
state
pass
a
law
refusing
admission
to
private
property
even
though
the
owner
wants
the
person
on
there,
my
answer
to
that
is
no,
the
state
cannot.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
if
you
have
an
anti-trespass
law
for
example,
and
the
owner
makes
no
objection
to
the
person
being
on
his
property,
i
do
not
think
that
the
trespass
law
would
apply,
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no,
sir,
you
have
a
disturbing
peace
or
someone
to
disorderly
conduct
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
sir,
we
have
no
affirmative
action
of
other
state.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
we
have
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
correct.
we
submit
further
that
these
cases
go
even
beyond
that
issue
because
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
the
sole
reasons
for
these
persons'
conduct
in
these
particular
cases
was
to
engage
in
a
demonstration
on
private
property
against
the
owner's
wishes,
a
seizure
of
the
owner's
property
in
an
effort
to
coerce
him
and
to
submitting
to
their
demand.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
think
it
--
i
submit
first
of
course,
that
the
court
--
the
question
of
occurred
as
presented
in
the
newspapers
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
to
everyone
within
the
community
which
the
court
could
have
taken
notice
of.
i
think
i
have
data
sufficient
in
the
record,
to
draw
it
from
the
record
itself.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
as
i
recall
this
honorable
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
judicial
notice
of
the
fact,
the
terrible
treatment
or
attitude
of
the
communist
governor
of
(inaudible)
and
certainly
i
think
this
would
be
the
facts
of
these
demonstrations
and
the
violence
which
have
occurred
in
their
wake,
is
just
as
much
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
as
is
the
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
sir,
not
actually
what
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
sir
i
didn't
–-
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no,
i
am
referring
to
the
demonstration
itself.
i
think
that
those
are
sufficient
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
i
think
from
the
record
also,
if
you
will
look
in
the
record
on
the
--
at
the
motions
to
quash
which
is
approximately
at
page
7
in
each
one
of
the
records
that
were
filed
by
the
defendants
and
constitutes
sworn
statements
of
the
defendant
that
are
in
the
record,
in
paragraph
six,
i'm
looking
at
number
six
of
the
garner
case,
number
27,
i
believe
it
is,
paragraph
six
of
the
motion
to
quash,
they
state
that
while
the
arrest
and
charges
were
brought
for
disturbing
of
peace,
there
was
not
a
disturbance
of
the
peace
except
for
the
activity
in
which
defendants
engaged
to
protest
segregation.
again,
in
paragraph
seven,
they
state,
that
here,
defendants
each
alleged
(inaudible)
and
going
down
a
little
further.
in
protest
of
the
segregation
of
laws
of
the
state
of
louisiana
did
on
the
29th
day
march
1960
“sit-in”
in
a
café
counter
seat.
i
do
not
believe
that
you
can
read
those
allegations
in
the
motion
to
quash
with
the
balance
of
the
testimony
without
drawing
the
conclusion
that
these
people
who
own
this
particular
property
on
these
particular
days,
not
for
normal
business
purposes,
but
to
carry
on
a
demonstration
to
promote
their
particular
beliefs,
that
the
property
owner
happens
not
to
agree
with.
they
went
into
his
place
of
business,
into
an
area
in
which
he
did
not
want
them.
they
were
requested
to
leave
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
--
or
at
least
leave
that
area.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
your
honor,
i
can
say
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
well,
i
have
taken
the
position
throughout,
your
honor,
that
the
owner
or
their
agents
did
take
affirmative
action
to
that
the
state
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
we
think
that
is
one
element
of
--
one
possible
view
of
the
case.
we
think
also,
that
there's
another
view
however,
and
that
is
that
under
these
particular
circumstances,
with
the
testimony
in
the
record
that
they
--
were
there
for
the
purpose
of
it
in
protesting
the
segregation
and
customs
in
law.
in
other
words,
expressing
themselves
that
under
the
situation
which
existed
in
baton
rouge
at
that
time,
and
which,
although
would
be
the
same
situation
does
not
exist
everywhere,
raise
relations
in
baton
rouge,
and
not
at
their
best
right
now.
under
those
situations,
that
situation
and
with
the
demonstrations,
we
submit
that
the
law
enforcement
officers
of
baton
rouge
can
move
into
avert
violence
and
disorder
in
the
community
that
would
flow
and
could
foreseeably
be
seen
to
flow
from
these
demonstrations.
we
know
that
it
occurred
in
almost
every
city
in
the
south
in
which
these
demonstrations
have
taken
place.
we
have
a
police
department,
not
the
best
in
the
world,
but
pretty
much
like
other
cities.
our
city
is
pretty
much
like
other
cities
throughout
the
country.
we've
got
a
majority
of
law-abiding
peaceful
citizens.
they
abhor
violence.
they
don't
hate
people,
they
don't
want
to
persecute
people
but
they
would
like
to
continue
to
carry
on
their
daily
activities,
their
daily
business
without
having
detention
and
the
violence,
possible
violence
and
disorder
which
is
caused
by
these
demonstrations.
we
think
that
our
police
officers,
not
only
have
the
right,
they
have
a
duty
and
responsibility
where
they
see
a
situation
existing
in
which
violence
--
from
violence
can
flow
that
they
should
step
in
and
stop
it
as
soon
as
they
can.
in
these
cases,
that's
what
they
did
over
and
above
if
you
take
that
view
of
it
or
the
garner
case
for
example
where
the
police
officer
actually
went
in
without
being
called.
perhaps
he
was
a
little
precipitous
in
acting
as
quickly
as
he
did,
but
he
was
acting
for
only
one
reason,
because
he
felt
that
violence
and
disorder
could
come
to
his
community
and
it
was
his
job
to
try
to
prevent
it
if
possible.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
t?if
you
ignore,
justice
potter
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
if
you
ignore
the
fact
of
these
demonstrations
throughout
the
south,
the
fact
that
baton
rouge,
responsible
officials
in
baton
rouge
have
been
wondering
for
many
months,
when
are
they
going
to
get
our
town?
you
find
out
that
these
things
are
going
or
occurring,
you'll
try
to
take
steps
to
prevent
them.
that
is
what
we
try
to
do
or
rather
the
city
of
baton
rouge
tried
to
do
in
these
instances
if
you
view
it
from
the
standpoint
that
the
private
property
owner
had
no
right
to
ask
these
people
to
leave
or
move
themselves
to
another
area,
and
had
no
right
then
to
use
physical
force
himself
to
evict
them,
or
if
he
did,
still
had
no
right
to
call
on
the
police
officers
to
evict
them
instead
of
himself
using
physical
force,
because
of
the
state
action
idea
of
the
police
being
involved,
which
we
submit,
in
either
view
of
the
case
--
if
you
take
it
on
the
first
view,
that
the
private
property
owner
objected
to
these
people
being
there
and
that
if
he
objected
to
their
being
there,
he
had
a
right
to
ask
them
to
leave.
and
if
he
had
that
right,
he
also
had
the
right
to
evict
them
if
they
refused
to
do
so,
use
physical
force
to
do
it.
if
he
had
that
right,
then
he
had
a
right
to
call
in
the
police
officers
to
evict
for
him
rather
than
use
his
own
physical
force
to
do
it.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
with
answer
to
the
first
part
of
your
question,
justice
black,
although
these
people
might
also
be
able
to
be
prosecuted
under
a
trespass
statute,
that
type
of
law,
we
submit
that
they
can
also
be
prosecuted
by
disturbing
the
peace
for
this
very
simple
reason.
their
action
in
being
on
the
premises
and
refusing
to
leave
after
the
being
requested
to
do
so
is
an
unlawful
act
to
begin
with.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
in
all
three
cases.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
on
page
30.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
about
the
middle
of
the
page.
“they
occupied
two
seats
and
their
presence
there
caused
me,”
this
is
the
owner
of
the
store
speaking,
“they
occupied
two
seats
and
their
presence
there
caused
me
to
approach
them
a
short
time
later
and
advise
them
that
we
couldn't
serve
them.”
then
further
on,
in
the
testimony.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
we
submit
that
there's
no
way
that
a
reasonable
person
can
walk
in
to
a
store
and
be
told
that
he
is
not
going
to
be
served
with
the
other
testimony
of
the
owner
in
this
particular
case
without
drawing
the
conclusion
that
the
owner
doesn't
want
them
there.
now
you
may
--.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
but
none
of
these
--
those
goods
that
you
were
referring
to
justice
black
are
in
this
portion
of
the
store,
this
is
a
separate
store
from
the
rest
of
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes
sir
in
all
three
cases,
we
think
the
testimony
of
either
the
owner
or
his
agents
or
the
manager
indicated
that
in
this
particular
area
of
his
store,
these
people
would
not
be
served.
in
one
store,
they
provided
service
elsewhere
for
him
and
they
were
told
that
they
could
get
service
over
there.
they
refused,
they
sat
right
there.
they
stayed
right
where
they
where
and
refused
to
leave.
i
don't
you
can
read
that
testimony,
a
man
asked
you
to
leave,
says,
“i
won't
serve
you
here
but
if
you
go
over
there,
i'll
serve
you”
and
you
refuse
and
stay
right
there,
i
can't
think
you
can
--
i
don't
think
you
can
read
this
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
in
the
garner
case,
no
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
of
course,
in
view
that
he
would
be
--
he
would
be
served
there,
i
think
the
only
conclusion
he
could
draw,
if
that
was
the
type
of
service
he
was
looking
for,
the
sitman's
drug
store
did
not
have
a
facility
for
him.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
you
don't
have
a
specific
statement
“get
off
of
my
property”
in
the
record,
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
think
in
each
one
--
in
each
one
of
the
three
cases,
there
is
a
definite
tone
from
the
record
or
inference
from
the
record
that
the
manager
or
the
agent
in
all
three
of
these
cases
are
the
owner,
he
did
not
own
that
particular
person
in
this
portion
of
his
premises
whether
that
portion
be
20
feet
square
or
only
one-foot
square
or
counters,
too.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
we
had
a
criminal
trespass
statute
in
effect
at
the
time
which
was
designed
primarily
for
country
property,
that
is
posting
and
fencing
against
hunting
and
trespassing
and
that
sort
of
thing,
i
presume,
although
i
did
not
have
a
copy
of
that
statute
here
with
me
that
though
--
i
do
in
fact
--
i
do
not
know
whether
it
would
have
applied
or
not
and
why
or
if
it
did,
why.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
the
district
attorney
did
not
use
it.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
sir,
the
then
district
attorney
not
used
that
statute
or
act.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
information,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
because
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
arguing
either
way
with
respect
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
i
see
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
see
what
you
mean.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
the
owner?
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
now
that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
like
the
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
it
has
been.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
it
also
involves
disturbance
of
peace,
the
trespass
action
itself.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
it
would
not
apply
under
the
language
of
the
trespass
statute
that
was
in
affect
at
that
time
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
--
because
it
referred
only
to
what
it
is.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct,
you
have
only
the
statute
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
how
do
you
establish
it?
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
you
must
show
that
there
is
some
--
there
is
an
act
committed
which
would
itself
--
which
would
foreseeably
disturb
and
alarm
the
public.
in
the
record,
we
think
we
show
an
act.
we
show
a
demonstration
to
protest
segregation.
we
think
under
the
existing
circumstances
in
baton
rouge
at
the
time
that
these
occurred,
there
was
a
foreseeability
that
would
disturb
and
alarm
the
public,
violence
and
disorder
could
follow.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
of
course
your
honor,
not
having
been
in
the
district
attorney's
office
at
the
time
these
cases
were
tried,
i
do
not
know
why
the
district
--
then
district
attorney
offered
what
he
did
or
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
--
things
that
he
did
not
offer.
however
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
we
submit
in
this
--
in
the
record,
you
have
evidence
that
from
which
a
reasonable
person
can
draw
the
conclusion
that
the
action
would
foreseeably
disturb
and
alarm
the
public.
and
that
under
cases,
that
is
all
that
is
necessary
to
justify
the
conviction
of
disturbing
the
peace.
in
other
words,
we
cited
in
our
brief
in
american
jurisprudence
for
example,
the
principle
that
--
an
act
which
are
the
certain
circumstances
in
time
would
not
constitute
a
disturbing
the
peace,
can
constitute
disturbing
the
peace
on
other
circumstances
and
at
a
different
time.
violence
is
not
necessary
to
the
charge
of
disturbing
the
peace
under
common
law.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
as
to
the
degree
that
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
as
to
the
degree
that
i'm
drawing
on
it,
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
me
to
say
your
honor.
i
think
certainly,
it
can
be
taken
notice
of.
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
of
the
fact
that
these
are
organized
demonstrations,
that
these
are
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
well
i
presume,
your
honor
that
he
would
know
that
from
the
same
way
that
you
knew,
that
this
court
knew
in
the
(inaudible)
case
of
the
terrible
attitude
of
the
chinese
communist
government.
i
presume
that
you
got
that
information
from
reading
newspaper
reports
of
the
things
that
the
chinese
communist
government
in
china
has
done.
you
took
judicial
notice
of
that
and
i
can
see
very
little
different
between
the
two.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
you
don't'
actually
have
way
--
we've
taken
the
position
to
begin
with
that
you
don't
have
to
take
judicial
notice,
it's
in
the
record.
we
also
state
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
in
their
sworn
statements
that
they
were
on
this
property
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
in
activity
to
--
to
protest
the
segregation
customs
of
louisiana
and
that
they
did
on
this
particular
date
in
order
to
protest
the
segregation
laws
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
both
city
and
for
the
café
counter.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
sir,
not
as
long
as
he
is
doing
so
in
a
place
where
he
has
a
right
to
be
such
as
the
cantwell
versus
connecticut,
state
versus
sanford
and
the
other
cases
dealing
with
public
streets.
when
he
abandons
the
police
where
he
has
a
right
to
that
demonstration
and
invades
private
property
for
that
purpose,
then
under
certain
circumstances
that
can
itself
constitute
disturbing
of
peace.
in
our
situation
in
baton
rouge,
it
constitutes
disturbing
of
the
peace
for
the
one
reason
that
violence
was
going
to
--
if
we
had
not
stopped
this,
if
we
had
allowed
these
demonstrations
on
private
property
to
continue,
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
violence
would
have
occurred
somewhere
along
the
line.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
submit
to
you
that
you
have
in
the
record
the
fact
that
these
people
were
engaging
in
a
demonstration
to
protect
segregation
on
private
property
which
they
had
no
right
to
do
and
it's
that
act
in
itself
on
private
property
constitutes
doing
an
act
in
a
manner
which
would
foreseeably
disturb
and
alarm
the
public.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct
and
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
from
the
trial
court
judge,
the
police
officer
could
do
it
because
he
has
knowledge
of
the
conditions
existing
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
but
with
respect
to
that
statement
justice
frankfurter,
i
would
say
this
that
the
trial
court
judge
in
louisiana,
we
submit
could
take
notice
of
the
racial
conditions
existing
in
the
south
and
in
baton
rouge
at
that
particular
time.
he
is
specifically
authorized
to
do
so
by
state
statute
and
our
states
supreme
court
has
done
so.
if
he
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
social
and
racial
conditions
prevailing,
then
he
had
before
him
the
possibility
of
violence
occurring
as
a
result
of
these
things.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
in
drawing
a
--
an
extreme
example
such
as
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
does
seem
to
be
a
big
jump.
but
living
in
baton
rouge
and
living
in
the
south
at
this
day
and
time,
it's
no
jump
at
all,
honestly.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
and
we
submit
that
in
--
in
many
--
in
many
towns,
they
have
done
it
without
any
demonstrations
at
all.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
we
submit
that
the
trial
judge
in
--
in
affirming
the
--
in
convicting
these
people
had
the
right
to
know
that
and
to
take
that
into
account
and
that
if
he
had
the
right
to
do
it,
then
it
exists.
it's
there,
and
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
alright.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes
sir,
on
page
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
on
page
7,
approximately
of
which
one
the
records.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
actually
the
language
is
the
same,
because
it's
contained
in
their
motion
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
--
to
quash.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
in
the
garner
case,
it's
contained
on
page
six
and
seven,
or
seven
and
eight,
paragraph
six
of
the
motion
to
quash,
that
while
the
arrest
and
charges
where
for
disturbing
the
peace,
there
was
not
--
there
was
not
a
disturbance
of
the
peace
except
for
the
activity
in
which
defendants
engaged
to
protest
segregation.
and
again
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
the
paragraph
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes
sir
and
that
use
of
the
criminal
process
in
such
a
situation
denies
and
deprives
the
defendants
of
their
rights,
privileges,
immunities,
and
liberties,
guaranteed
to
the
defendants,
each
citizens
of
the
united
states
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
when
they
say
that
were
engaged
in
an
activity
to
protest
segregation
on
this
private
property
which
is
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
well,
i
think
there's
evidence
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
the
property
owner?
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
sir
and
we
submit
that
in
the
record,
the
testimony
of
the
property
owners
in
this
case
indicate
that
they
want
to
keep
it
private
and
that's
why
we
say
that
this
act
became
an
unlawful
act.
we
submit
as
noted
in
our
supplemental
brief
for
example,
these
cases
are
almost
identical
to
the
sit-down
strike
case
as
in
the
late
1930s.
the
acts
are
virtually
the
same
and
the
purpose
of
the
acts
are
the
same.
in
the
sit-down
strike
case,
the
employees
felt
that
the
owner
should
pay
them
better
wages.
they
sat
down
on
his
property
and
refused
to
give
it
up
in
order
to
coerce
him
and
to
meeting
their
demand.
in
these
cases,
where
you
don't
even
have
an
employer-employee
relationship
which
is
at
least
makes
it
a
little
closer,
these
people
did
the
same
thing.
they
sat
in
on
this
person's
property,
took
possession
of
it
and
refused
to
give
up
possession
of
it
in
order
to
coerce
this
owner
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
he
requested
them
to
leave
the
particular
area
of
the
store
in
which
they
were.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
he
told
them
that
he
would
not
serve
them
and
--
in
the
cases
where
they
had
other
facilities,
you
will
be
served
over
there.
i
don't
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct.
that's
in
the
garner
case.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
(inaudible)
sincerely,
i
submit
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
you
can
read
the
language.
i
have
a
man
who'll
tell
you
when
you
walk
in
and
ask
them
for
a
service
at
a
particular
place
for
a
particular
thing
and
he
says,
“i
can't
serve
you,”
i
don't
think
you
can
take
that
to
mean
anything,
but
leaves
so
that
other
customers
can
occupy
the
place.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
frankly
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
think
the
records
shows
it
in
the
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
not
that
there
was
a
sign,
no
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
think
when
it's
done
under
these
circumstances,
your
honor,
yes
sir.
this
might
be
a
possibly
different
situation
if
this
was
in
the
normal
course
of
business,
if
these
people
were
doing
so
--
or
just
a
normal
situation.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
these
people
were
not
there
for
--
just
to
buy
a
cup
of
coffee.
these
people
were
there
to
demonstrate
and
protest.
i
don't
think
you
can
read
the
record.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
alright.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
so,
for
two
reasons.
one,
because
the
demonstration
under
the
facts
you
have
assumed,
the
demonstration
is
an
unlawful
act,
and
i
think
that
from
that
alone
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
oh,
no.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
justice
whittaker,
in
the
briscoe
case
which
is
number
i
believe
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
if
you're
referring
to
the
garner
case
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
the
one
in
which
the
police
officer
came
in
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
--
without
having
been
called
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
--
and
admittedly
the
garner
case
was
weaker
than
the
other
two
to
that
extent,
and
that
he
was
not
actually
called
by
the
owner
of
the
premises.
we
submit
in
line
with
the
--
the
cases
involved
in
the
right
of
an
officer
to
direct
people
to
move
on
--
on
the
public
street,
and
on
what
he
thinks
violence
is
likely
to
occur
that
some
discretion,
some
judgment
must
be
given
to
the
police
officer
in
order
to
carry
out
their
responsibility
to
prevent,
to
stop
before
it
starts
possible
violence
and
disorder
in
a
community.
in
your
situation,
i
doubt
that
your
--
the
example
you
just
gave
mr.
chief
justice,
i
doubt
seriously
that
the
police
officer
would
ever
make
an
arrest
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
think
then,
it
would
be
a
question
of
whether
or
not
he
has
exceeded
his
authority.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes
sir,
you
have
that.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
because
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
because
under
these
circumstances,
the
question
of
the
demonstration
–
race
relations
being
what
they
are
in
baton
rouge
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
sir?
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
the
fact
that
these
are
a
part
of
a
demonstration,
the
fact
of
race
relations
in
baton
rouge,
the
fact
that
you
do
not
have
it
in
the
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
we
submit
that
when
you
read
the
entire
record
with
the
statements
of
the
defendants
that
they
were
there
engaging
in
activity
to
protest
segregation
that
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes
sir,
again
depending
upon
the
particular
circumstances
and
the
judgment
of
the
officer.
in
this
case,
in
the
garner
case,
i
think
the
officer
acted
because
he
--
he
felt
that
violence
would
occur.
i
think
the
trial
court
judge
agreed
with
him
that
if
he
--
he
hadn't
stopped
this,
violence
would
have
occur.
in
the
church
example
which
you
give,
you
at
least
have
the
more
conciliatory
passive
atmosphere
of
the
church.
as
i
say,
i
do
not
believe
there
would
have
been
arrest
in
the
example
that
you
gave.
i
think
that
example
is
different
really
from
this.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
do
they
state
it
in
the
record?
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
they
make
statements
to
--
to
that
effect,
your
honor,
after
all
the
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
not
by
those
statements
alone.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
think
when
you
read
the
statement
of
the
manager
of
hoston,
he
feared
the
disturbance
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
at
page
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
page
30
of
the
record
in
number
29,
hoston
versus
louisiana.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
as
to
the
fear
of
disturbance,
no
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
except
in
the
hoston
case.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
we
sustain
the
garner
case
on
two
basis;
one,
that
the
police
officer,
in
trying
to
prevent
disorder
in
his
community
has
some
exercise
of
judgment
in
whether
violence
will
occur.
for
example,
in
the
feiner
versus
new
york
case
where
the
person
made
several
statements
with
--
with
regard
to
the
mayor
of
new
york
and
--
and
referred
to
truman
and
someone
else,
the
police
officers
asked
him
to
cease-and-desist
after
he
felt
that
the
people
would
--
would
get
unruly
--
might
get
unruly.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
and
the
man
refused
and
he
arrested
him.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
if
you
mean
a
specific
statement
by
him,
no
sir,
there
is
none.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
our
appreciation
of
the
record
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
our
appreciation
of
the
records
and
all
of
it
--
taken
all
of
the
testimony
and
the
statements
in
their
motion
to
quash
together,
we
submit
--
we
believe
that
there
is
that
evidence
in
the
record.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
have
to
put
it
out
in
--
in
the
testimony
and
the
motions
to
quash
as
a
whole
including
their
statements
that
they
were
engaging
in
an
activity
to
protest
segregation.
i
think
the
judge
took
the
testimony
that
he
heard
as
a
whole
together
with
what
he
knew
of
existing
conditions
in
baton
rouge
at
the
time.
i
think
the
police
officer
did
the
same
thing.
with
the
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
plan
to
briefly
cover
it
as
well
as
the
other
contentions
i
make.
of
course,
they
raise
the
question
of
that
they
are
being
denied
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
guaranteed
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
we
have
cited
few
cases,
the
kovacs
case
and
the
schenck
case
which
indicates
that
freedom
of
speech
is
not
an
unlimited
right
given
the
example
of
justice
holmes,
for
example,
the
case
of
the
man
yelling
“fire”
in
the
auditorium.
we
further
submit
that
really
for
that
contention
which
also
we
think
is
another
admission
by
the
defendants
that
were
engaged
in
a
demonstration
because
certainly,
in
these
cases,
if
they
were
denied
freedom
of
speech
and
expression,
it's
only
because
they
were
engaged
in
a
demonstration,
and
nowhere
we
submit
in
the
first
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
or
in
any
case
they
have
cited,
is
there
any
language
or
any
decision
which
gives
a
person
the
right
to
freedom
of
speech
and
expression
on
another
man's
property
against
his
wishes.
and
that
this
freedom
of
speech
or
expression
which
they
claim
the
right
to
have
does
not
come
within
that
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment,
that
is
the
freedom
to
express
yourself
in
public
places
as
in
your
own
private
property,
not
the
freedom
to
express
yourself
or
profound
your
beliefs
on
property
owned
by
another
without
that
person's
consent.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
either
one
really,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
if
the
owner
advised
him,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no.
it's
got
to
be
without
the
owner's
objection,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
--
the
defendants
attempt
to
bring
these
cases
within
the
doctrine
of
civil
rights
cases
in
shelley
versus
kraemer.
they
asked
you
to
stretch
those
cases
to
cover
this
particular
situation.
we
submit
that
actually
what
they
ask
you
to
do
in
order
to
adopt
their
proposition
with
respect
to
this
argument
is
to
reverse
the
civil
rights
cases
because
all
of
the
civil
rights
cases
had
held
that
the
right
of
which
a
man
to
privately
discriminated
the
right
to
choose
his
own
associates
has
always
remained
with
him
and
the
shelley
versus
kraemer
or
in
the
barrows
versus
jackson
or
any
of
the
other
cases
denying
him
that
right.
in
this
case,
you
have
a
disturbing
of
peace
statute
which
is
applied
indiscriminately
to
all
persons
whether
they'd
be
white,
black,
chinese,
religious
affiliation,
republican
or
democrat,
when
they
commit
an
act
which
can
foreseeably
result
in
a
disturbance
or
alarming
of
the
public,
they
are
arrested
under
this
act.
it's
not
used
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
nor
is
it
used
to
enforce
a
private
segregation.
the
question
of
who
a
man
lets
on
his
property
is
a
question
for
he
alone
to
decide
and
not
the
state.
we
have
enacted
no
statute
which
requires
segregation
in
these
places.
we
have
enacted
no
statute
which
requires
integration
in
these
places.
that
is
the
right
of
the
property
owner
himself
to
choose
and
this
statute
is
applied
only
when
the
property
owner
has
exercised
his
right
and
a
person
refuses
to
leave
his
property
on
a
situation
where
the
acts
of
these
persons
are
going
to
cause
violence
and
disorder
to
occur.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
where
that
is
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
of
course
we,
in
baton
rouge,
we
didn't
do
that
your
honor.
when
they
were
demonstrating
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
--
when
they
were
demonstrating,
where
they
had
a
right
to
be
--
that
if
picketing
some
several
stores,
marching
down
the
main
street,
the
capital
steps,
we
did
protect
their
right
to
do
so.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
it's
correct.
that's
correct.
and
he
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
sir.
he
does
not.
he
has
choice
to
make
whichever
way
he
makes
it.
the
state
has
no
right
to
interfere
with
it.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
you
would
have
that
situation
your
honor
only
in
the
garner
case
and
in
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
in
reading
the
testimony
of
mr.
wilkes,
the
owner
of
sitman's
drug
store
in
which
the
garner
case
took
place
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
--
that
you
can
draw
the
conclusion
necessarily
from
the
testimony
that
he
was
not
asking
the
person
to
leave.
we
contend
that
he
was
even
though
he
did
not
say
the
specific
words,
“please
get
up
and
leave”.
we
contend
that
the
inference
--
the
only
inference
that
you
can
draw
from
that
testimony,
the
only
conclusion
you
can
draw
is
that
he
was
in
fact
asking
the
person
to
leave
because
he
had
no
place
to
serve
him
and
he
was
taking
up
space
which
his
other
customers
might
have
been
using.
under
those
circumstances
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no,
that's
correct.
in
so
many
words,
specifically
no,
sir,
he
did
not.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
normally,
in
criminal
cases,
you
choose
the
presumption
of
innocence.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
if
you
have
it
all,
your
honor,
respectfully,
it's
in
the
garner
case.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
not
in
the
other
two.
in
the
other
two,
you
had
the
manager,
the
agent
calling
the
police
department
asking
them
to
come
to
protect
his
rights.
there's
no
question
from
the
testimony
in
both
the
hoston
and
the
briscoe
case
that
he
was
called.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
sir.
as
i
recall
the
record,
the
only
case
at
which
the
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
--
police
was
not
called
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
--
was
in
the
garner
case.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
the
next
argument
that
is
advanced
and
it
is
advanced
primarily
by
the
government,
at
least
it
appeared
to
be,
is
that
because
louisiana
has
adopted
segregation
laws
in
other
fields
or
other
areas
in
the
past,
and
because
the
people
of
louisiana
had
a
custom
of
segregation,
that
this
is
state
encouragement
in
the
inception
of
this
segregation
and
that
the
adoption
of
the
segregation
laws
in
other
fields
puts
the
state
into
the
--
the
discrimination
to
begin
with.
in
other
words,
they
make
the
argument
you
go
beyond
the
question
of
state
enforcement
of
private
discrimination.
they
now
say
that
because
we
have
had
segregation
laws
in
other
fields
that
makes
us
a
part
of
the
original
discrimination
which
is
therefore
prohibited
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
of
course
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
if
you
boil
our
argument
down,
it
simply
means
that
in
a
state
which
has
segregation
laws,
the
private
businessmen
can
no
longer
refuse
to
admit
whomever
he
might
choose
to
his
business
or
refuse
to
service
to
whomever,
so
he
--
whomsoever
he
might
chose
while
in
a
state,
perhaps
montana
or
nebraska
or
colorado
where
--
which
has
had
no
segregation
laws,
the
private
businessmen
in
that
state
still
has
the
right
to
choose
whom
he
shall
render
his
services
to.
we
submit
that
--
that
the
argument
on
its
face
must
be
invalid
on
that
basis.
the
government
then
raises
the
question
of
the
briscoe
case,
the
interstate
commerce
act
relying
on
boynton
versus
virginia.
with
respect
to
that
case,
we
would
submit
first
that
you
have
the
same
situation
here
that
you
had
in
boynton
versus
virginia
to
the
extent
that
the
restaurant
is
not
owned
by
the
interstate
commerce
carrier,
it
is
owned
by
a
separate
corporation
not
under
the
control,
and
therefore,
fits
into
the
dissent
by
justice
stewart,
joined
by
justice
clark.
in
addition
in
the
boynton
case,
you
had
a
passenger
in
interstate
commerce.
here,
you
do
not.
now,
the
government
argues
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
by
the
use
of
the
term
any
particular
person
includes
people
even
who
are
not
in
interstate
commerce.
we
submit
respectfully,
your
honors,
that
when
you
read
the
language
of
the
statute
in
which
all
of
the
--
when
which
the
discrimination
is
prohibited,
where
they
say
to
subject
any
particular
person,
port,
gateway,
locality,
region,
district,
territory
or
description
of
traffic
that
you
must
relate
all
of
those
first
words
to
the
term
or
description
of
traffic,
because
that
is
only
the
separation.
all
of
the
other
words
are
lumped
together
and
only
disjunctively
separated
by
the
term
description
of
traffic
which
implies
by
description
of
traffic,
they
mean
traffic
in
interstate
commerce,
and
that
the
act
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
persons
or
goods,
not
in
interstate
commerce.
in
fact,
i
think
congress
intended
that
in
the
language
that
they
chose
from
the
fact
that,
of
course,
congress
gets
its
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
through
the
interstate
commerce
clause,
that
is
to
regulate
commerce
between
and
among
the
states
and
that
would
necessarily
apply
to
the
carrier
in
the
interstate
commerce
and
it
would
necessarily
apply
to
the
goods
that
he
carries
in
interstate
commerce,
and
of
course,
this
court
has
held
and
it
also
applies
in
areas
where
interstate
commerce
would
be
affected
or
it
would
be
a
burden
upon
interstate
commerce
which
you
do
not
have
here.
in
addition
to
that,
we
would
also
submit
that
nowhere
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
or
the
interstate
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution
that
you
find
any
authority
for
a
person
to
go
on
to
private
property
of
anyone
even
in
interstate
commerce
carrier
and
engage
in
a
demonstration
which
that
commerce
carrier
doesn't
want
him
to
do.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
correct
justice
harlan,
i'll
do
that
right
now.
they
allege
that
this
act
is
so
vague
and
uncertain
that
a
reasonable
man
would
not
know
what
his
conduct
was.
we
submit
that
in
almost
every
state
in
the
union
and
almost
--
and
cities
throughout
the
nation,
you
have
ordinances
and
statutes
which
are
worded
almost
identical
to
this.
and
the
authorities
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
it
has
been
pointed
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
require
a
legislature
to
sit
down
every
specific
act
that
could
constitute
the
charge
of
disturbing
the
peace,
the
common
law
disorderly
conduct.
we
submit
that
in
this
particular
statute,
we
have
set
down
some
specifics
and
then
an
additional
clause
to
cover
any
other
act
committed
in
such
a
manner
as
would
foreseeably
disturb
and
alarm
the
public.
under
the
cases,
including
the
cases
of
this
honorable
court
such
as
the
nash
case
in
which
you
were
involved
with
an
anti-trust
statute
which
certainly
appeared
to
me
to
be
far
more
complicated
than
this
statute,
you
found
that
the
criterion
was
--
would
a
more
--
would
a
different
conduct
have
been
more
circumspect
under
the
circumstances.
we
submit
using
that
criterion
that
you
used
in
the
nash
case
on
an
attack
of
vagueness
of
the
statute,
using
that
criterion
here,
we
think
certainly,
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
people
knew
that
the
acts
which
they
were
committing
could
foreseeably
alarm
or
disturb
the
public.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
sir,
it's
not.
it's
about
1930,
i
believe,(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
with
respect
to
the
case
of
state
versus
sanford,
i
think
that
there
has
been
and
the
fourth
--
and
that
case
did
not
apply
the
statute.
they
reversed
a
conviction
under
this
particular
statute,
under
the
facts
of
that
case
which
were
similar
to
the
facts
in
cantwell
versus
connecticut,
which
this
court
decided
which
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
state
versus
sanford.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
believe
that
it
was,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
with
this
particular
statute,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no,
sir.
that's
state
versus
morgan
that
he's
referring
to
there,
where
the
person
went
on
the
plantation,
again,
i
think
jehovah's
witnesses
and
the
--
person
ordered
them
to
leave,
he
then
went
back
to
the
farm
--
other
farms
on
the
plantation
itself
against
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
state
versus
morgan,
on
the
trespass.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i'll
try
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
sir,
no
sir.
that's
correct.
in
the
sanford
case,
they
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
they
said
the
under
these
--
under
those
facts,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
your
honor,
but
in
the
sanford
case,
they
did
say
that
under
the
facts
of
the
sanford
case,
there
is
the
jehovah's
witnesses
being
on
the
public
streets
disseminating
their
literature
in
a
peaceful
manner,
this
statute
was
not
the
subsection
and
the
statute
was
not
applicable.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
law,
that's
correct,
perhaps
that's
the
explanation.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
was
my
primary
point.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
was
the
primary
point.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
if
i
understand
my
own
state
supreme
court
probably
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
they
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
the
statement
in
their
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
as
i
understand
the
state
appellate
procedure,
the
court
leaves
the
question
of
facts
or
sufficiency
of
facts
to
the
jury
below
in
criminal
cases.
and
will
only
discuss
facts
at
all
if
then,
and
i'm
not
positive
on
this,
your
honor,
is
on
the
writs
of
certiorari,
prohibition
and
mandamus
--
under
the
supervisor's
jurisdiction
where
there
is
alleged
constitutional
deprivation.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
it
is,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
as
a
matter
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i'm
not
disagreeing.
i
haven't
read
the
constitutional
article
on
jurisdiction
recently,
but
it's
my
understanding
that
the
supreme
court
has
jurisdiction
of
all
criminal
cases
regardless
of
fine.
now
of
course,
in
smaller
amounts,
you
can
start
in
a
municipal
court
and
appeal
to
the
district
court,
but
it
becomes
a
trial
de
novo.
there
from
there,
then
you
go
to
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
alright.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
oh
yes.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that's
my
opinion.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
is
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
was
--
it
was
an
imprisonment
in
lieu
of
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
90
days
i
believe.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
i
can
conclude
my
argument
in
a
very
a
few
moments.
i
would
like
to
attempt
to
clear
up
one
thing.
we
have
advanced
the
argument
that
a
private
property
owner
has
the
right
to
refuse
admission
to
all
of
his
property
or
a
portion
of
his
premises
or
to
refuse
service
to
anyone
that
he
wishes
and
that
this
court
has
never
denied
that
he
has
that
right.
and
as
a
corollary
that
if
he
does
have
that
right,
he
has
the
right
to
remove
the
person
by
his
own
physical
force
or
in
lieu
thereof,
to
call
upon
law
enforcement
officials
to
act
for
him.
you
have
indicated
in
your
questions
that
that
is
possibly
acceptable
as
a
legal
proposition
but
that
in
the
record
you
do
not
find
facts
which
justify
that
conclusion.
with
respect
to
the
hoston
case
which
is
kress'
department
store
and
briscoe
case
which
is
the
post
house
restaurants,
in
both
records,
you
will
find
testimony
in
the
case
of
hoston,
the
kress'
store
by
the
manager
that
he
asked
them
to
leave,
that
he
told
them
they
would
not
be
served
at
one
counter,
but
would
be
served
at
another
counter
that
he
feared
a
disturbance
and
that
he
himself
called
the
police.
in
the
briscoe
case,
you
find
the
testimony
of
the
waitress
that
she
told
them
they
would
not
be
served
at
one
counter,
but
would
be
served
at
the
other
counter
and
that
“we”
as
she
put
it,
called
the
police.
in
both
of
those
records,
you
find
the
man
indicating
the
owner
of
the
business
or
his
agents,
indicating
that
he
did
not
wished
to
serve
these
people
at
that
particular
portion
of
his
premises,
and
that
he
would
prefer
for
them
to
go
to
another
portion.
then,
in
the
furtherance
of
that
request,
you
find
that
he
called
the
police
to
carry
out
--
carry
it
out
for
him.
the
police
came
at
his
request.
they
asked
these
persons
to
leave
the
lunch
counter
where
the
manager,
the
owner
had
already
indicated
he
did
not
want
them
to
be
and
it
was
only
after
they
refused
again
to
leave,
the
lawful
direction
of
the
police
officer
made
at
the
request
of
the
property
owner
that
they
would
finally
arrested
and
charged
with
disturbing
the
peace.
we
submit
that
at
the
very
least
in
the
hoston
record
and
in
the
briscoe
record,
you
have
evidence
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
manager
or
the
owner
of
the
property
requested
them
to
leave
that
particular
area
of
his
store
and
that
in
order
to
accomplish
that
request,
he
called
the
police
department
and
asked
them
to
carry
it
out
for
him.
now,
in
the
garner
case,
as
mr.
chief
justice
pointed
out,
you
do
not
have
the
call
from
the
manager
or
owner
of
the
store
to
the
police
department.
you
have
the
statement
by
the
owner
that
he
has
never
had
facilities
in
his
restaurant
for
the
colored
race.
he
had
only
facilities
for
the
one
and
that
he
asked
these
--
told
all
these
people
that
they
would
not
be
served.
we
submit
that
in
the
garner
case,
the
worst
that
could
be
said
of
it
is
perhaps
that
the
police
officer
acted
somewhat
precipitously
in
trying
to
carry
out
his
responsibility
to
prevent
violence
and
disordering
his
community,
but
in
the
hoston
and
the
briscoe
cases,
we
submit
that
in
the
record
itself,
you
have
ample
evidence
of
the
request
by
the
owner
to
leave
this
particular
area
of
his
store
and
to
move
to
another
area
and
when
they
refused
to
do
so,
a
request
by
the
owner
of
the
lawful
--
law
enforcement
authorities
to
carry
out,
to
come
assist
him
in
carrying
out
his
request.
they
then
requested
that
these
people
leave
and
only
after
they
were
refused
were
the
arrest
then
made.
we
think
those
two
cases
clearly
come
within
the
statute
and
that
the
convictions
should
be
affirmed.
we
submit
that
in
the
garner
case,
even
without
that
facet
of
it,
that
the
police
officer
and
in
line
with
the
cases
we
cited,
people
versus
arko
and
people
versus
nixon
and
the
others
that
the
police
officer
had
the
authority
to
act
to
prevent
violence,
that
he
had
a
right
to
foresee
the
possible
violence
it
could
result
and
that
his
request
that
they
leave
under
these
circumstances
was
not
unreasonable
and
should
have
been
obeyed
and
that
their
failure
to
obey
the
order
amounted
to
a
disturbance
of
the
peace.
in
conclusion,
i
would
say
this.
if
i
could,
i
would
pull
briefly
from
the
editorial
in
the
morning
advocate
at
the
time
that
these
sit-in
demonstrations
occur.
these
are
times
that
require
understanding
goodwill
and
patience
regardless
of
how
hard
these
things
may
sometimes
come
to
some
among
us,
the
recognition
and
acceptance
that
really
count
cannot
be
hastened
or
(inaudible)
by
any
action
that
creates
alarm,
destroys
goodwill
or
alienates
the
different
groups
in
the
community.
our
society
may
have
its
imperfections
as
do
all
things
of
human
desire,
but
this
is
not
the
way
improvements
will
be
brought
about.
time
and
orderly
evolution
can
bring
progress.
force
can
bring
none.
we
respectfully
submit
that
in
the
interest
of
better
relation
between
the
races
and
the
interest
of
reasonableness
of
peace
and
order,
in
the
interest
of
all
of
the
parties
concerned,
the
shop
owners,
the
demonstrators,
the
general
public,
these
convictions
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
