justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
an
amendment
to
the
statute
that's
involved
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
a
separate
statute,
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
not
an
amendment
to
this
one.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
they
--
they
did
have
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
it's
a
private
property,
is
it
not,
it
was
a
private
property,
correct?
justice
john
m.
harlan
from
the
standpoint
of
your
argument,
your
constitutional
argument
as
i
understand
it,
do
you
think
the
factual
distinction
between
these
cases
are
insignificant
or
--?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
might
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
might
be
a
difference
between
the
cases
if
you
had
a
trespass
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
factual
distinction
is
--
would
become
pertinent
perhaps
in
those
circumstances
whereas
you
claim
they're
not
under
this
breach
of
the
peace
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
you
have
to
start
onto
with
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
in
order
to
assess
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
don't
we
have
to
take
the
statute,
i'm
not
saying
whether
the
interpretation
is
constitutional
or
not,
don't
we
have
to
start
with
the
premise
that
this
case,
skimpy
as
this
record
is,
comes
to
us
just
as
if
there
had
been
written
into
the
louisiana
statue
that
going
in
to
a
private
restaurant,
if
you
segregate,
and
the
sitting
at
a
lunch
counter
and
refusing
to
leave
the
lunch
counter
when
requested
by
a
police
officer
amounts
to
the
breach
of
the
peace,
isn't
that
where
we
have
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
you
can't
say
that
if
that
statute
is
--
how
can
you
say
that
if
that
sort
of
the
statute
is
before
us
and
assume
it's
constitutional,
that
there
isn't
enough
evidence
here
to
support
the
verdict?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
we
have
to
start
with
the
state
court's
interpretation
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
the
question
becomes
not
one
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
does
it
because
these
facts
are
there
in
the
record,
but
rather
one
as
to
whether
that
kind
of
the
statute
is
constitutional?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
sufficiency
how
you
can
get
writ
of
this
case
on
thompson
against
louisville.
that's
where
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
going
to
deal
with
argument
of
the
petitioners
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutionally
vague,
the
section
under
which
they
were
prosecuted,
section
7?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
haven't
dealt
with
the
argument
as
to
vagueness?
