mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
these
three
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
petitioners
having
asserted
in
the
courts
below
and
asserting
here
right
secured
by
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
cases
are
what
colloquially
and
generally
have
been
referred
to
as
sit-in
cases.
the
petitioners
are
students,
boys
and
girls
who
attended
southern
university
at
baton
rouge,
louisiana.
they
were
arrested
and
convicted
of
disturbing
the
peace
at
three
establishments
in
baton
rouge,
a
drugstore,
lunch
counter,
a
bus
terminal
lunch
counter
and
a
dime
store
lunch
counter
while
seeking
service
there
on
a
nonsegregated
basis.
mr.
jack
greenberg
they're
college
students.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there's
no
question
of
juvenile
proceedings
or
anything
that
--
were
involved
under
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
statute
under
which
they
were
convicted
which
appears
in
louisiana
statutes
annotated
title
14,
section
103
contains
seven
subsections
and
it
is
pertinent
to
the
case
that
i
briefly
review
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
the
introductory
provision
states
and
i
quote,
“disturbing
the
peace
is
the
doing
of
any
of
following
in
such
a
manner
as
would
foreseeably
disturb
or
alarm
the
public.”
and
then
there
are
six
subsections
which
i
will
rapidly
paraphrase
and
the
seven
subsections
under
which
they
were
convicted.
the
first
six
subsections
provide
defines
as
disturbing
of
peace:
(1)
engaging
in
a
fist
fight,
(2)
using
unnecessarily
loud,
offensive,
or
insulting
language
(3),
appearing
in
an
intoxicated
condition,
(4)
engaging
in
any
act
in
a
violent
and
tumultuous
manner
by
any
three
or
more
person,
(5)
holding
an
unlawful
assembly
and
(6)
interfering
with
a
lawful
assembly.
the
seventh
subsection,
under
which
they
were
convicted
and
the
only
subsection
which
is
directly
applicable
to
this
case
makes
criminal
the
commission
of
any
other
act
in
such
a
manner
as
to
unreasonably
disturb
or
alarm
the
public.
the
penalties
provided
by
this
act
or
a
fine
of
$100
imprisonment
for
not
more
than
90
days
or
both.
before
stating
the
facts
of
each
of
these
three
cases,
each
of
which
differ
somewhat
from
one
another,
petitioners
will
first
briefly
identify
two
of
their
legal
arguments
which
are
common
to
all
of
the
cases
that
these
arguments
are
intimately
related
to
each
other
and
to
the
fact
and
because
presentation
of
the
facts
petitioner
submit
will
dispose
of
the
largest
part
of
the
argument.
petitioners
first
contend
that
(1),
as
this
statute
has
been
construed
previously
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
louisiana,
(2)
by
its
plain
and
ordinary
meaning,
and
(3)
by
reading
it
in
a
context
of
louisiana
legislation
passed
after
the
sit-ins
occurred
for
the
purpose
of
dealing
with
sit-ins,
the
statute
now
under
scrutiny
requires
the
proof
of
elements
of
guilt
which
do
not
at
all
appear
upon
these
records.
and
that
the
judgment
below
upon
a
record
barren
of
evidence
is
fatally
defective
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
this
court
held
in
thompson
versus
city
of
louisville.
on
the
other
hand,
petitioners
contend
that
if
this
statute
is
not
to
be
read
as
having
its
ordinary,
settled
meaning
by
which
i
submit
there
can
be
no
question,
it
must
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
presence
of
a
negro
at
a
lunch
counter
which
by
custom
in
louisiana
is
reserved
for
white
persons
is
as
a
matter
of
law
a
disturbance
of
the
peace,
and
therefore,
the
only
factor
upon
which
these
convictions
rest
is
that
these
petitioners
were
negroes
seated
at
white
lunch
counters.
as
a
consequence
the
convictions
are
defective
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
forbids
the
state
to
enforce
racial
segregation.
the
other
issues
in
this
case
which
i
might
mention
briefly
at
this
point
involve
a
challenge
to
the
statute
on
the
ground
that
(1)
it
is
unconstitutionally
vague
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
(2)
a
challenge
to
the
judgment
below
on
the
ground
that
a
punished
expression
protected
by
the
first
amendment
as
read
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
before
going
to
the
first
two
issues,
however,
petitioners
will
first
make
clear
what
is
not
involved
in
these
cases.
these
cases
do
not
involve
a
variety
of
questions
proposed
by
respondent's
brief
and
elsewhere.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
of
the
validity
or
constitutionality
of
disturbing
the
peace
or
breach
of
the
peace
statutes
in
their
normal
use
or
operation.
two,
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
of
the
validity
of
state
enforcement
of
choice
of
guests
or
persons
with
whom
one
would
associate
where
the
law
or
recognizes
an
almost
unlimited
right
of
privacy
such
as
in
the
home
or
in
a
strictly
private
club.
three,
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
of
anyone
being
punished
for
having
and
attempting
to
exercise
by
the
use
of
private
action
only
a
personally
held
racial
prejudice.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no
sir,
not
but
that
--
i
understand
it
would've
been
applicable
to
this
case.
in
fact
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
was
a
no
trespass
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
was
but
would
not
even
be
remotely
applicable
to
this
type
of
situation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
believe
that
we
didn't
even
go
into
it.
it's
cited
in
the
government's
brief
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
there
was
a
(inaudible).
mr.
jack
greenberg
they
have
now
enacted
two
statutes
which
we
quote
in
our
brief
that's
specifically
deal
with
sit-ins,
refusal
to
leave
a
lunch
counter
when
ordered
to
and
there
is
a
criminal
mischief
statute
also
which
is
to
the
same
effect
and
those
statutes
are
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'll
read
the
statutes
so
that
i
won't
run
the
risk
of
incorrectly
paraphrasing
it.
on
page
31
of
our
brief,
we
quote
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
first
statute,
“whoever
with
intent
to
provoke
a
breach
of
the
peace
or
under
circumstance
as
such
that
a
breach
of
the
peace
may
be
occasioned
thereby
refuses
to
leave
the
premises
of
another
when
requested
so
to
do
by
any
owner,
lessee,
or
any
employee
thereof
shall
be
guilty
of
disturbing
the
peace.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
sir.
and
then
a
new
statute,
a
criminal
mischief
statute
which
appears
at
the
top
of
page
32
of
our
brief
deals
with
taking
temporary
possession
of
any
part
or
parts
of
the
place
of
business
or
remaining
in
a
place
of
business
after
the
person
in
charge
of
such
business
or
portion
of
such
business
has
ordered
such
person
to
leave
the
premises
and
to
desist
from
the
temporary
possession
of
any
part
or
parts
of
such
business.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
this
case
involves
only
the
use
of
state
power
to
convict
persons
who
in
entirely
peaceful
manner
sought
nonsegregated
service
at
a
lunch
counter
reserved
by
state
custom
in
accordance
with
state
policy
for
white
persons
only
in
an
establishment
generally
open
for
the
public.
the
first
case,
number
26,
garner
versus
state
of
louisiana
commenced
with
an
information
which
on
page
one
of
the
record
stated
that
the
two
defendants
in
that
case
on
the
date
in
question
did
felonously
and
unlawfully
violate
article
103,
section
7
of
louisiana
criminal
code
in
that
they
refused
to
move
from
a
café
counter
seat
at
sitman's
drug
store
gives
the
address
in
baton
rouge
after
having
been
ordered
to
do
so
by
the
agent
of
sitman's
drug
store,
said
conduct
being
in
such
a
manner
as
to
unreasonably
and
foreseeably
disturb
the
public.
after
motions
to
quash
and
the
bill
of
particulars
were
denied
and
relief
against
these
denials
were
sought
in
the
state
supreme
court
and
denied,
petitioners
went
to
trial.
the
record
in
this
case
as
in
the
other
two
cases
is
exceeding
brief
and
consist
of
the
testimony
of
two
witnesses.
first
witness
is
the
owner
of
the
drugstore,
the
second
is
captain
weiner
of
the
baton
rouge
police
who
performed
the
arrests
or
participated
in
the
arrest
of
each
of
these
cases
and
was
the
prosecution
witness
in
each
of
these
three
cases
involving
these
events
which
occurred
on
two
consecutive
days.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there's
a
two-page
opinion
which
appears
near
the
end
of
each
of
the
records
which
states
briefly
that
the
state
supreme
court
is
without
power
to
review
the
fact
and
the
trial
court
was
correct
on
the
law.
they
said
the
opinion
consist
merely
of
two
sentences.
if
you
were
inquiring
whether
there
was
an
opinion
of
the
denial
of
the
motions
to
quash
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
just
merely
do
not.
on
page
29
of
the
garner
record,
which
is
number
26,
the
manager,
mr.
willis,
who
was
in
fact
the
owner
of
sitman's
drugstore.
mr.
willis
testified
that
on
march
29th,
1960
the
two
petitioners
came
into
the
store
and
they
simply
seated
themselves
at
the
lunch
counter,
described
the
episode
as
follows.
they
occupied
two
seats,
in
their
presence
they
have
caused
me
to
approach
them
a
short
time
later
and
advised
them
that
we
couldn't
serve
them
and
i
believe
that
the
police
came
and
arrested
them
and
took
them
away.
he
was
asked
what
they
said
and
what
happened
on
this
occasion.
he
said
one
asked
for
coffee
and
i
told
them
we
couldn't
serve
them
and
one
of
the
boys
said
he
wants
some
coffee.
then
said
the
police
arrived
within
10
minutes,
less
than
10
minutes.
he
made
it
quite
clear
that
he
did
not
call
the
police
and
he
did
not
know
who
called
the
police.
although,
there's
an
inference
that
a
police
officer
in
the
store
perhaps
had
called
them
and
the
police
captain
later
testified
that
he
was
called
by
the
cop
on
the
beat
and
we
might
assume
that
this
was
the
same
person.
testified
that
in
this
store
he
used
his
words
and
page
32
of
the
record,
negroes
are
very
good
customers
and
indeed
one
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
had
purchased
an
umbrella
in
the
store.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct,
and
on
page
33
of
the
record,
he
added
that
there
was
no
complaint
to
him
from
any
of
his
customers
concerning
this
situation
either.
that
consists
of
the
testimony
of
the
manager
of
the
store
as
to
his
experience
with
this
event.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no
sir,
it
certainly
would
not.
mr.
jack
greenberg
is
there
any
dispute
in
the
record?
no,
that's
completely
uncontradicted.
he
doesn't
know
who
called
the
police.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
believe
so,
sir,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
have
nearly
accepted
the
statement
of
the
state
supreme
court
on
those
points,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
you
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
they
said
that
the
statute
was
not
--
it
was
city
ordinance,
it
was
not
unconstitutionally
vague
in
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
sir.
the
ponchatoula
decision,
as
i
--
i
have
it
right
here.
but
as
i
recall
it,
certainly,
it's
just
on
the
face
of
the
city
ordinance
which
was
a
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that's
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
when
the
court
adjourned
yesterday,
i
was
reviewing
the
record
in
number
26,
the
garner
case.
and
we
had
just
reviewed
the
testimony
of
the
store
manager
which
amounted
to
the
fact
that
the
students
had
appeared
at
the
store,
had
asked
for
coffee
and
that
the
police
arrived,
the
manager
hadn't
call
them,
the
police
had
not
consulted
with
the
manager,
and
the
police
arrested
the
students.
captain
wiener,
the
police
officer,
who
--
the
police
captain
who
made
the
arrests
in
each
of
these
three
cases,
testified
in
this
case
as
he
did
in
the
others,
that
he
received
a
call
at
the
police
headquarters
from
the
officer
on
the
beat
and
i'm
referring
to
page
34
of
the
record.
he
told
me
that
there
were
two
negroes
sitting
at
the
lunch
counter
at
sitman's
drugstore.
i
told
them
to
just
standby
until
he
arrived.
they
immediately
went
to
the
store
within
less
than
10
minutes,
spoke
to
the
students,
major
bauer
approached
them
and
told
them
that
they
were
violating
the
law
by
sitting
there
and
asked
them
to
leave
and
when
they
refused
to
leave,
major
bauer
arrested
them.
the
police
captain
was
asked
why
he
arrested
them,
what
law
were
they
violating,
and
he
said,
“by
the
fact
that
they
were
sitting
at
a
counter
that
was
reserved
for
white
people.”
and
he
was
pressed
on
this
point
saying
now,
“just
what
law
was
that?”
and
he
said,
“the
law
said
that
this
place
was
reserved
for
white
people
and
only
white
people
can
sit
there,”
and
that
was
the
reason
they
were
arrested.
further
pressed
on
the
point,
he
said,
“they
have
a
law
here.
i
believe
that
covered
such
a
situation.”
and
then
he
was
driven
back
to
saying,
that
law
at
the
bottom
of
page
35
of
the
record,
“is
the
“disturbing
the
peace”
law.”
and
when
asked
how
were
they
disturbing
the
peace
on
page
36
of
the
record,
he
answered
affirmatively
to
a
question
which
was,
“the
mere
presence
of
these
negro
defendants
sitting
at
this
café
counter
seat
reserved
for
white
folks
was
violating
the
law,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?”
and
so
that
is
what
constituted
the
violation
of
the
law
in
number
26.
on
the
basis
of
this
record
and
this
is
the
entire
transcript
of
testimony
that
i've
summarized
and
i
believe
accurately,
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
of
guilt
and
that
was,
it
appears
on
page
37
of
the
record,
it
occupies
about
of
half
a
page,
these
two
accused
who
are
in
this
place
of
business
on
the
date
alleged,
they
were
seated
at
the
counter,
they
were
not
served,
the
officers
were
called,
they
arrived,
they
informed
the
accused
they
would
have
to
leave,
and
they
refused
to
leave,
whereupon
the
officers
placed
them
under
arrest
under
section
103
(7).
and
the
court
was
convinced
by
this
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
these
two
defendants
on
this
occasion
at
that
time
and
place
performed
an
act
done
in
a
manner
calculated
to
and
actually
did
unreasonably
disturbed
and
alarmed
the
public.
the
basis
on
of
this
finding
of
guilt,
the
court
sentenced
the
petitioners
to
30
days
imprisonment,
a
$100
fine,
and
upon
default
of
the
payment
of
$100,
they
would
have
to
serve
90
days
in
jail
which
would
run
consecutively
with
the
30.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
it's
cited
in
the
government's
brief,
i
believe
on
page
32.
well,
is
it
on
--
it's
said
in
the
government's
brief.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
old
trespass
statute
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
it
was.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
it
was.
the
petitioner
sought
review
in
the
state
supreme
court
on
appropriate
writs
under
louisiana
law
and
review
was
denied
in
the
two
sentence
opinion
which
we
just
referred
to
a
moment
ago.
they
obtained
stays
of
execution
and
came
here
for
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
the
record
in
number
27,
the
briscoe
case
is
in
many
respects
similar.
it
involves
a
sit-in
of
students
of
southern
university
at
the
greyhound
bus
terminal
in
baton
rouge,
louisiana.
the
information
is
identical
to
the
information
in
the
garner
case.
the
testimony
is
of
course
slightly
different
and
i'll
briefly
review
the
testimony
in
the
briscoe
case.
the
waitress
testified
that
she
was
in
the
bus
terminal
on
march
29
when
the
defendants
in
the
case
came
in.
she
testified
they
came
in
there
and
i'm
reading
from
page
30,
and
they
sit
down
on
the
front
seven
seats
and
they
start
ordering
and
i
told
them
they
would
have
to
go
to
the
other
side
to
be
served.
and
then
when
asked
why,
she
said,
“the
colored
people
are
supposed
to
be
on
the
other
side.”
and
then
she
said
i,
further
on
page
31,
there
are
similar
testimony,
and
she
then
testified
that
when
--
they
would
not
seek
service
on
the
other
side
to,
“we
called
the
police
and
told
them
to
come
get
them.”
it's
not
quite
clear
and
that
it
is
not
further
elucidated
in
the
record
who
called
the
police
or
what
the
police
were
told.
she
was
then
questioned
concerning
the
scope
of
her
authority,
what
it
was
that
she
was
authorized
to
do
in
case
negroes
sought
service
at
the
white
lunch
counter.
and
she
described
her
authority
as
follows,
“merely
amounted
to
authority
to
tell
them
that
if
they
wanted
service,
they
could
obtain
it
at
the
negro
lunch
counter.”
apparently,
it
did
not
go
beyond
that.
on
page
32
of
the
record,
slightly
below
the
middle
of
the
page,
in
quoting
her
superior,
describing
what
her
superior
authorized
her
to
say,
he
said,
“she
just
said
for
us
to
refuse
service
to
anyone”
and
they
came
in
there
and
sit
down
and
we
have
a
place
in
the
other
side
for
them
to
be
served
at,
and
they
came
in
there
and
sit
down
and
i
told
them
they
would
have
to
go
to
the
other
side
to
be
served”
and
she
said
something
to
the
same
effect
at
the
bottom
of
that
page.
mr.
jack
greenberg
32,
yes.
now
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
superior
did
not
testify
and
so
the
testimony
amounts
to,
we
submit,
that
she
had
authority
to
and
merely
told
them
that
if
they
wanted
service,
they
would
have
to
go
to
the
other
side
to
get
it.
although
in
response
to
other
questions,
she
creates
some
ambiguity
and
makes
it
appear
that
perhaps
she
also
told
them
--
she
also
gave
them
a
direction
to
go
to
the
other
side.
however,
we
construe
this
testimony
and
we
feel
that
in
view
of
the
constitutional
questions
involved
and
the
scope
of
her
authority,
this
court
should
read
this
testimony
as
meaning
clearly
what
we
think
it
does
mean
that
she
told
them
if
they
wanted
service,
they
would
have
to
obtain
it
on
the
other
side.
in
any
event,
the
police
officers
arrived.
the
police
officers
are
not
clear
as
to
who
called
them.
apparently,
it
was
a
bus
driver
or
some
woman.
they
did
not
consult
with
the
waitress.
they
went
immediately
to
the
students
at
the
counter
and
as
captain
wiener
who
appeared
in
the
first
case
testified,
“inspector
bauer
received
a
call
from
some
woman
at
the
bus
terminal,
inspector
bauer,
myself
proceeded
to
the
bus
station
with
some
officers,
and
saw
these
people
sitting
at
the
lunch
counter.”
that's
at
the
bottom
of
34.
and
he
said,
at
the
top
of
35,
“this
lunch
counter
was
reserved
for
white
people.”
inspector
bauer
spoke
to
them
and
told
--
and
after
he
spoke
to
them
the
second
time,
told
them
that
they
were
under
arrest.
they
came
along
peacefully.
when
he
was
asked
how
he
knew
that
was
a
counter
for
white
people.
he
said,
“well,
that's
pretty
obvious
from
the
people
there.”
“why
did
you
arrest
them
officer?“
on
36,
“in
my
opinion,
they
were
disturbing
the
peace.”
“within
your
opinion,
explain
your
opinion”
and
he
says,
in
language
almost
identical
to
that
he
uses
in
the
other
two
cases,
“the
fact
that
their
presence
was
there
in
the
section
reserved
for
white
people,
i
felt
that
they
were
disturbing
the
peace
of
the
community”
and
on
38,
“in
what
way
were
they
disturbing
the
peace?”
answer,
“by
the
mere
presence
of
them
being
there.”
there
is
no
allegation
or
no
testimony
concerning
anything
else
other
than
the
mere
presence
of
them
being
there.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
sir.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
sir.
neither
where
there
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
there
is
no
specific
statute
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is,
however,
as
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
a
resolution
of
the
louisiana
legislature
stating
segregation
is
the
policy
of
this
state
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
in
1960.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
sir.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
sir.
the
court's
finding
which
is
on
page
38
and
39
of
the
record
rests
on
two
legs
and
they
are,
as
i
think
a
plain
reading
indicates,
independent
of
each
other.
the
court
finds
them
guilty
as
charged
for
the
reason
that
from
the
evidence
in
this
case,
their
actions
in
sitting
on
stools
in
this
place
of
business
when
they
were
requested
to
leave
and
they
refused
to
leave
–-
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
bottom
of
38
in
briscoe,
number
27
and
the
court
then
finds,
in
addition,
the
officers
were
called,
the
officers
requested
them
to
leave
and
they
still
refused
to
leave.
their
actions
in
that
regard
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
was
an
act
on
their
part
was
unreasonably
disturbed
and
alarmed
the
public.
so
they
were
found
guilty
because
they
did
not
leave
as
the
court
found
when
the
waitress
asked
them
to
leave
and
because
they
did
not
leave
when
the
police,
as
an
independent
matter,
asked
them
to
leave.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
sir.
that's
our
first
position.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
our
alternative
position
is
that,
if
that's
not
true
or
even
if
that
is
true,
these
--
these
records
must
be
read
as
indicating
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
louisiana
courts
have
said
that
the
mere
presence
of
the
negro
at
white
lunch
counter
is
a
disturbance
of
the
peace
and
that
is
also
unconstitutional.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
could
dispose
of
the
case,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
this
is
a
case
which
can
be
disposed
of
on
a
number
of
different
grounds
and
there
is
the
question
suggested
by
the
government's
brief
as
to
what
perhaps
should
be
the
narrowest
ground
of
disposition.
and
it
would
be
presumptuous
for
me
to
really
suggest
what
i
thought
would
be
the
narrowest
ground
of
disposition.
however,
i
do
believe
that
the
narrowest
ground
of
disposition
would
be
one
based
upon
the
fact
that
these
people
were
arrested
solely
because
they
were
negroes
at
a
white
lunch
counter,
that
any
other
ground
of
disposition
suggested
here,
while
equally
valid,
would
have
ramifications
in
many
other
areas
of
the
law
whereas
this
is
so
settled
and
so
clear-cut,
it
would
be,
in
my
view,
the
narrowest
ground,
but
i
would
do
no
more
than
suggest
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
you
could
say
it's
due
process
and
equal
protection
or
primarily
equal
protection,
yes
sir.
i
would
say
that
the
narrowest
ground
for
disposition
of
this
case
in
my
view
is
that
these
police
officers
came
in
there
and
on
their
own
saw
these
negro
students
sitting
at
the
lunch
counter
and
arrested
them
solely
because
they
were
negroes
at
the
lunch
counter
and
that
in
of
itself
constituted
disturbance
of
the
peace.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
believe
that's
a
necessary
prerequisite.
it
does
happen
to
be
the
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
be
prepared
to
argue
the
next
position.
i
don't
think
we
have
to,
to
some
extent,
it's
suggested
as
an
issue
and
i
feel
that
that
situation
is
identical
to
the
first
situation.
i
do
think,
however,
that
these
are
records
which
clearly
indicate
--
some
that
you
have
to
get
from
the
tone
of
the
record
really,
that
these
--
this
police
officer
captain
wiener
was
the
head
of
a
flying
squad
who
appeared
within
ten
minutes
of
notification
that
the
negroes
are
in
the
lunch
counter
and
without
consulting
with
anybody
or
doing
or
having
any
evidence
of
any
violation
of
the
law,
just
on
his
own,
went
in
there,
grabbed
them
and
arrested
them.
i
think
these
records
support
that
factually
and
do
convey
the
--
what
i
merely
would
call
a
tone
of
just
how
he
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
haven't
argued
that.
but
i
would
certainly
feel
that
way
about
it.
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
would
be
an
exceedingly
narrow
ground,
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
two
of
the
cases,
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
that
anybody
ordered
them
to
leave.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
the
third
case,
i
will
have
to
be
entirely
candid
and
say
that
there
is
some
evidence
which
if
read
in
the
context
of
the
whole
record,
we
believe,
doesn't
indicate
what
it
purports
to
indicate
that
the
waitress
asked
them
to
leave.
however,
we
feel
her
testimony
should
be
read
that
she
did
not
ask
them
to
leave,
merely
informed
them
that
they
could
be
served
elsewhere,
and
then
certainly
her
authority
did
not
extend
to
demanding
that
they
leave.
and
that
in
these
cases
therefore,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
police
were
the
ones
who
asked
them
to
leave,
as
certainly
even
in
the
middle
case,
27,
and
that
for
the
police
officer,
in
fact,
you
might
argue
that
for
the
police
officer
on
his
own
to
be
going
around
enforcing
a
segregation
practice
is
even
--
is
even
more
unconstitutional.
that's
possible
than
doing
it
according
to
a
statute
because
at
least,
there,
he
has
a
command
of
the
legislature.
here,
he's
taking
the
law
into
his
own
hands.
and
so
it
is
the
police
going
around
enforcing
segregation
at
lunch
counters
which
we
feel
is
the
most
apparent
constitutional
vice
in
these
cases
and
we
would
submit
with
deference
is
the
real
narrow
ground
in
these
cases,
because
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
anything
would
be
more
clear.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
sir,
open
--
places
of
public
accommodation
--
it's
not
a
--
they
are
not
places
as
private
in
nature
but
they
are
not
publicly
owned
institution.
now,
i
do
not
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
they
are.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
sir,
these
are
places
of
public
accommodation,
completely
open.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
two
of
cases,
in
the
third
case
i
think
the
record
should
be
read
--
that's
our
position
in
all
three
cases,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
sir,
that's
how
we
read
that
testimony.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
in
the
third
case.
no,
i
read
them
all.
i
read
the
testimony
the
same
in
all
three
cases.
the
difference
in
the
cases
is
this,
i
do
not
think
it's
a
real
difference
that
in
the
middle
case,
briscoe
number
27,
there
is
a
word
or
two
of
testimony
that
the
waitress
asked
them
to
leave,
to
move.
the
only
clear
construction
of
that
testimony
in
the
light
of
all
her
other
testimony
is
that
she
told
them
if
they
wanted
to
be
served,
they
could
go
to
the
colored
counter.
but
in
any
event,
in
all
of
the
cases,
quite
apart
from
what
any
private
person
might
have
done,
the
police
without
consultation
with
any
private
person
on
their
own
went
in
there
and
ordered
these
people
out.
in
fact,
in
the
drug
store
case,
the
police
officer
didn't
even
know
who
the
manager
was,
he
just
immediately
went
to
the
students
and
that
appears
to
be
the
record
in
all
three
of
the
cases.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
hoston
case,
there
was
no
waitress
testifying
in
that.
that
was
the
manager
of
the
store
mr.
mathews.
the
waitress
testified
in
the
briscoe.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
mathews,
on
page
what?
mr.
jack
greenberg
where
there
--
29,
yes
where
there
is
a
question.
yes
that's
clearly
the
hoston
case.
they
were
certainly
not
requested
to
move.
the
problem
and
i
fear
that
by
the
length
of
this
discussion,
i'm
magnifying
it
into
more
than
it
really
is
because
i
don't
believe
it
is
a
problem,
is
in
the
briscoe
case,
the
middle
case,
in
which
although
she
testified
that
i
told
them
they
would
have
to
go
to
the
other
side
to
be
served
and
then
she
testified
because
we're
supposed
to
refuse
the
service
of
anyone
that
comes
in
there,
she
also
later
testified
in
response
to
a
leading
question
which
was,
“did
you
ask
them
to
leave
and
so
forth?”
and
she
said,
“yes.”
the
bottom
of
31,
“ms.
fletcher,
is
that
the
only
reason
you're
asking
them
to
leave
is
because
they
were
negroes?”
and
she
said,
“yes,
sir.”
i
think
in
the
entire
context
of
a
testimony
that
merely
means
that
she
told
them
that
they
could
go
to
the
other
counter
if
they
wanted
to
be
served.
and
i
think
our
authority
extended
no
further
than
that.
and
i
think
the
finding
of
the
court
based
upon
the
police
officers'
independent
demand
to
leave
is
the
same
as
in
all
the
other
cases.
in
this
case,
too,
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
i'm
in
briscoe,
number
27.
in
this
case
to
the
seven
students
were
sentenced
to
30
days
plus
90
days
upon
default
of
payment
of
$100
fine.
they
sought
writs
of
certiorari
and
so
forth
in
the
state
supreme
court
which
is
the
appropriate
mode
of
review.
review
was
denied
in
language
identical
to
that
used
by
the
state
supreme
court.
in
the
other
cases,
stays
of
execution
were
obtained
except
in
the
case
of
one
student
who
had
already
been
picked
up
by
the
sheriff,
writ
for
his
release
was
obtained
and
these
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
as
number
26.
number
28
is
the
“sit-in”
case
involving
kress'
dime
store
in
baton
rouge,
and
in
this
case,
the
testimony
is
similar
and
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
indicated,
when
the
manager
testified,
“were
they
requested
to
move
over
to
the
counter
reserved
for
colored
people?”
he
said,
“no
sir,
they
were
advised
that
we
would
serve
them
over
there.”
the
manager
in
this
case
was
so
little
disturbed
by
what
happened.
he
was
eating
his
meal
at
the
counter
when
the
students
arrived.
he
finished
his
meal
first,
then
he
went
to
the
telephone
and
he
called
the
police,
but
he
did
not
call
the
police
to
arrest
them
and
he
did
not
call
the
police
because
there
was
any
disturbance.
he
said
he
called
them
merely
as
a
cautionary
measure
because,
“i
feared
some
disturbance
might
occur
because
it
isn't
customary
for
the
two
races
to
sit
together
and
eat
together.”
however,
there
was
no
testimony
that
any
disturbance
did
occur.
in
fact
as
in
the
other
cases,
they
were
arrested
as
captain
wiener
testified
again
that
--
here's
the
question,
“did
these”
--
on
37,
“did
these
defendants
do
anything
other
than
sit
at
these
particular
café
counter
seats
that
you
would
consider
disturbing
the
peace
who
are
in
violation
of
any
law?”
answer,
“well,
other
than
the
fact
that
one
of
them
mentioned
something
about
the
iced
water,
nothing
else
was
said”
and
then
another
question,
“how
are
they
disturbing
the
peace”
and
as
in
the
other
records,
“by
sitting
there”
“and
that
is
because
they
were
members
of
the
negro
race?”
answer,
“that
was
because
that
place
was
reserved
for
white
people.”
and
on
38
and
39,
the
court
makes
a
finding
similar
to
the
finding
of
the
other
cases,
though
the
findings
in
each
case
are
in
slightly
different
language
and
careful
reading
indicates
that
different
facts
were
found
in
each
such
as
--
in
garner,
it
was
found
that
they
actually
did
disturbed
the
peace
and
no
such
thing
occurred
in
--
briscoe
was
found,
they
actually
would
alarm
the
public
and
in
this
one,
it
was
found
they
foreseeably
could
alarm
the
public.
so
there's
some
slight
difference
in
language.
no
evidence
of
any
of
these
different
either
it
did,
could,
or
would.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
they're
insignificant,
however
i
candidly
have
to
recognize
that
there
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
some
evidence.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
we
would
--
we
would
submit
that
the
result
would
be
the
same
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
part
of
it
--
it
would
certainly
be
a
different
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
they
would
be
pertinent
in
a
--
they
would
be
pertinent
in
a
trespass
case
in
the
sense
that
they
would
be
at
issue,
we
feel
that
the
result
would
be
the
same,
and
that
there
has
to
be
an
answer
to
it
and
there
is
an
answer
to
it.
the
court
does
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
sir.
certainly
we
don't
even
reach
that
first
question.
and
none
of
these
cases
where
they
ordered
out
as
i
think
the
records
clearly
indicate.
now,
number
28,
the
finding
briefly
is
they
were
--
that
they
came
in
and
they
took
seats
at
the
lunch
counter
which
by
custom
had
been
reserved
for
white
people
only.
this
is
in
the
judgment.
they
were
advised
by
an
employee
of
that
store,
by
the
manager,
that
they
would
be
served
over
at
the
other
counter
which
was
reserved
for
colored
people.
they
did
not
accept
that
invitation.
they
remained
seated
at
the
counter
which
by
custom
had
been
reserved
for
white
people.
the
officers
were
called
and
the
officers
talked
to
these
accused
or
some
of
them
and
the
defendants
continued
to
remain
seated
at
this
particular
counter.
that
testimony
is
uncontradicted
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
the
action
of
these
accused
violated
the
statute
which
is
cited
in
that
the
act
in
itself,
they're
sitting
there
and
refusing
to
leave
when
requested
to
and
this
must
refer
to
the
police
because
he
found
and
only
could
find
that
the
manager
didn't'
request
them
to
leave.
when
requested
to,
it
was
an
act
which
foreseeably
could
alarm
and
disturb
and
public
and
therefore
was
a
violation
of
that
statute
that
i
have
just
mentioned
and
these
cases
too,
they
received
the
same
sentence.
these
cases
too
were
taken
for
the
state
supreme
court,
stays
were
obtained
and
the
case
was
here
on
certiorari.
now,
the
first
argument
of
petitioner
is
that
--
petitioners
is
that
they
were
not
convicted
upon
any
records
which
contained
any
evidence
that
they
had
committed
any
other
act
in
such
a
manner
which
unreasonably
disturbed
or
alarmed
the
public.
in
fact,
the
only
thing
they
were
found
guilty
of,
to
quote
the
police
officer,
“it
was
the
mere
presence
of
their
being
there.”
the
statute
with
which
we
are
concerned
would
not
sustain
the
conviction
of
any
white
person
sitting
at
these
characters
and
indeed,
the
records
indicate
that
white
persons
were
sitting
at
the
counters
and
the
mere
presence
of
they're
being
there
did
not
constitute
a
crime.
the
statute
has
been
construed
once
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
the
case
cited
in
all
the
briefs
state
v.
sanford
and
a
case
remarkably
like
this
one,
involving
jehovah's
witnesses
in
which
jehovah's
witnesses
were
engaged
in
their
normal
cosmetising
activities.
they
had
been
ordered
by
the
mayor
to
leave
town
because
he
was
afraid
that
they
would
disturb
persons
of
other
religions
there
who
were
offended
by
their
activities.
they
persisted
in
distributing
these
tracks
and
were
rested
under
a
predecessor's
statute
which
is
not
materially
different
from
this
one.
and
the
state
supreme
court
held
first
that
the
application
of
the
statute
by
the
trial
judge
and
the
facts
of
this
case
and
its
construction
thereof
would
render
it
unconstitutional
under
cases
of
this
court
dealing
with
freedom
of
religion
of
jehovah's
witness.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well,
i
perhaps
overstated
when
i
said
it
was
just
like
this
case.
there
are
sufficient
points
of
similarity
to
make
it
pertinent
to
this
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
and
the
state
supreme
court
held
with
respect
to
a
finding
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
what
might
we
called
the
seventh
subsection
in
this
statute
that
is
our
opinion
that
the
statute
is
an
applicable
to
these
case
because
it
appears
to
the
defendants
did
not
commit
any
unlawful
act
or
pursue
an
unlawful
or
disorderly
course
of
conduct
which
would
tend
to
disturb
the
peace
and
to
further
support
our
contention,
we
--
that
the
statute
--
that
these
petitioners
did
not
do
anything
which
violates
the
statute.
we
just
point
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
evidence
of
this
case.
and
even
more
forcefully
to
the
fact
that
it's
obvious
that
the
supreme
--
that
the
louisiana
legislature
did
not
think
so
in
this
case
because
they
enacted
the
statutes
which
we
referred
to
yesterday
to
quite
apparently
by
their
language
to
cover
what
we
properly
call
“sit-in”
demonstrations.
and
consequently,
our
first
argument
is,
as
we
stated
at
the
outset,
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
these
people,
these
petitioners
committed
any
act
which
leaving
questions
of
vagueness
aside
for
a
moment
which
any
conceivable
reading
of
subsection
(7)
indicates
is
a
crime
and
the
judgments
below
must
fall
as
the
denial
of
due
process
under
this
court's
decision
in
thompson
against
louisiana.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
sir,
i
think
it
ultimately
does
come
down
to
that,
though
as
in
thompson
v.
louisville
case
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
was
arguing
this
--
i
thought
i
made
my
position
clear
at
the
outset
that
if
we
accept
the
statute,
absent
reading
this
racial
factor
into
it,
which
i
don't
think
we
can
do,
but
if
we
accepted
that
way
as
in
terms
of
any
language,
the
louisiana
has
elucidated
in
terms
of
legislative
context,
other
cases'
plain
meaning
and
so
forth,
then
we
come
under
the
thompson
case
because
in
the
thompson
case
at
some
point,
i
imagine
this
court
has
to
make
an
interpretation
of
the
statute.
there's
no
--
there's
no
avoiding
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
yes.
but
now,
i
say
that
this
case
therefore
only
can
be
read
as
you
mr.
justice
harlan
have
described
that
the
mere
presence
of
their
being
there,
the
negro
at
a
white
lunch
counter
constitutes
the
breach
of
the
peace.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
sir.
and
viewing
it
in
that
light,
the
question
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
that
evidence
is
sufficient.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
don't
either
your
honor.
i
don't
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
if
this
court
--
if
this
court
read
to
the
louisiana
statute
as
it
appeared
just
in
terms
of
its
plain
language
and
in
terms
of
the
sanford
case
and
in
terms
of
this
legislative
--
subsequent
legislative
history
then
--
then,
we
can
say
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence.
however,
in
the
alternative,
you
must
say
that
these
people
were
convicted
of
being
negroes
at
a
white
lunch
counter.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
if
you
exclude
the
racial
aspect
as
--
as
upon
the
face
of
the
statute,
louisiana
has
purported
to
do,
you
can
decide
this
on
thompson.
if
you
read
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
did.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
--
if
you
exclude
it
and
if
it
can
be
excluded,
then
you
decide
it
on
thompson,
but
i
think
realistically
speaking
these
people
were
convicted
of
being
negroes
at
a
white
lunch
counter
and
consequently
the
convictions
are
defective
under
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
no,
i
don't
think
we
have
been
to
go
that
far
to
the
tone
of
the
record.
i
think
actually
these
records
indicate
that
what
did
they
do
--
the
mere
presence
of
their
being
there,
and
some
of
the
findings
say
that
they
were
negroes
sitting
at
a
white
lunch
counter.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
you
could.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
you
can
pose
it
in
either
terms.
i
think
--
i
mean,
for
all
of
us
to
be
realistic,
everybody
knows
this
case
does
involve
these
people
being
arrested
because
they're
negroes
at
a
white
lunch
counter
and
this
doesn't
require
judicial
knowledge.
it's
in
the
record,
but
the
case
in
terms
of
legal
analysis
can
be
treated
in
either
way
and
i
was
trying
to
present
this
court
the
different
ways
in
which
i
thought
it
could
be
treated.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
did
not
review
the
fact.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
or
it
held
it
could
not
review
the
facts.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
sir.
in
fact,
i
might
point
out
in
connection
with
the
thompson
case
that
there's
an
additional
similarity
between
this
and
thompson
because
thompson
also
was
really
a
review
of
what
was
an
adjudication
by
the
lowest
court
--
by
a
police
court
though
this
case
has
gone
up
through
the
judicial
hierarchy
in
louisiana,
they
abstained
from
reviewing
the
judgment
below.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
well
in
terms
of
--
in
terms
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
this
court
abstained
from
--
the
state
supreme
court
abstained
from
reviewing
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
will
confess
that
i
am
not
entirely
familiar
with
intricacies
of
louisiana
appellate
procedure.
mr.
tureaud
who
was
our
louisiana
lawyer
has
handed
me
a
note
which
says
that
the
state
supreme
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
by
appeal
but
it
did
have
by
certiorari
which
is
what
this
proceeding
was.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
it
did
not
--
it
did
not
make
any
adjudication,
just
abstained.
our
first
legal
argument
as
i
hope
i
brought
out
in
response
to
questions
was
that
it
ought
to
be
cleared
that
where
the
police
officer
acts
initially
because
he
observes
the
negroes
sitting
at
the
counter
reserved
for
white
persons,
but
this
arrest
and
conviction
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
in
the
--
any
number
of
cases,
i
think
this
court
has
made
clear
the
principles,
the
state
may
not
enforce
racial
discrimination
and
certainly
there
can
be
no
more
effective
state
officer
than
the
police
officers.
and
i
think
all
of
these
records
ought
to
be
read
and
must
be
read
as
the
police
officer
captain
wiener
coming
to
the
lunch
counter
upon
receiving
calls
from
a
variety
of
people
saying
these
negro
students
sitting
at
the
lunch
counter
and
arresting
them
for
the
mere
presence
of
their
being
there.
number
27
briscoe,
there
has
been
a
suggestion,
the
government's
brief
discusses
it
at
some
length,
that
perhaps,
there
might
have
been
an
initial
request
by
somebody
in
the
establishment
that
these
petitioners
leave.
we
don't
read
the
record
that
way
and
i
read
the
record
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
indicated
that
they
at
best
told
that
they
could
be
served
over
at
the
other
side
if
they
wanted
to.
moreover
in
briscoe,
the
finding
of
the
court
rests
on
one
independent
ground
that
the
police
officer
told
them
to
leave
and
they
did
not
and
we
submit
that
under
decisions
of
this
court
in
stromberg
against
california,
the
williams
case,
and
terminiello
that
if
one
of
the
two
grounds
of
a
conviction
is
unconstitutional,
then
as
part
of
a
generalized
finding,
then
the
conviction
must
fall.
so
all
three
cases
fall
under
the
first
argument
that
we
have
made,
that
where
the
police
officer
acts
initially
because
he
sees
the
negroes
sitting
at
the
counter
reserved
for
white
persons,
such
a
arrest
and
conviction
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
however,
this
court
were
to
read
the
record
in
the
briscoe
case
as
indicating
some
demand
to
leave
and
we
don't
think
it
should,
we
submit
that
it
should
not
make
any
difference
constitutionally
that
the
police
officer's
action
was
motivated
by
the
fact
that
the
manager
at
the
lunch
counter
refused
to
serve
and
thereafter
requested
the
police
officer
to
make
the
arrest
which
after
indictment
is
followed
by
conviction.
in
this
situation,
you
have
state
action
in
the
arrest
of
the
defendant,
trial
of
the
defendant,
the
conviction,
the
sentencing
of
the
defendant,
all
taken
solely
to
enforce
the
private
racial
prejudice
of
a
citizen.
this
court
previously
has
held
that
such
state
action
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
in
the
girard
college
case
where
stephen
girard
set
up
a
will
and
to
enforce
his
private
prejudice,
got
state
officials,
city
officials
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
to
implement
this
prejudice.
this
court
struck
that
down
in
a
brief
opinion
and
we
feel
that
in
the
shelley
and
the
barrows
case,
barrows
against
jackson
and
other
cases,
this
court
has
clearly
indicated
that
if
state
action
is
enforcing
private
prejudice,
that
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
should
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
our
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
as
i
understand
certiorari
was
denied
in
that,
and
that
was
after
the
divestiture
by
the
state
officials
and
so
forth.
i
don't
--
i
really
--
well,
i
don't
view
it
as
shedding
light
on
this
particular
problem
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
coleman
was
the
lawyer
who
took
it
here
and
informs
me
that
they
did
not.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
just
a
few
brief
matters
to
which
i
would
like
to
refer
and
then
we
will
conclude.
the
first
is,
i
would
like
first
to
straighten
out
the
matter
of
how
the
girard
college
case
came
here.
i
think
i
now
have
it
straight.
they
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
alright.
secondly,
so
far
the
reviewability
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
this
case,
i
think
the
state
and
the
petitioners
are
now
on
agreement.
these
cases
came
up
to
the
state
supreme
court
on
writs
of
certiorari
and
the
state
supreme
court
held
in
these
cases
that
the
rulings
of
the
district
judge
on
matters
of
law
are
not
erroneous
and
so
substantively
passed
upon
the
questions
of
law.
the
questions
of
fact
in
the
case
which
they
said
they
could
not
pass
upon
are
so
far
as
these
cases
are
presented
here,
questions
of
law,
indeed
questions
of
constitutional
law
because
as
in
the
thompson
case,
it
indicates
a
complete
lack
of
facts
in
the
record
--
indicates
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
and
so,
the
cases
are
here
on
matters
of
law
which
the
state
supreme
court
has
ruled
upon
and
has
said
that
it
can
rule
upon.
i'd
like
briefly
to
refer
to
the
hoston
record
about
which
the
state
has
made
some
reference
and
the
testimony
of
the
owner
appears
on
page
30
of
the
record
and
makes
quite
clear
just
what
he
said,
what
he
did
and
why
he
called
the
police.
“after
i
finished
my
meal,
i
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
the
police
department.”
“why
did
you
call
the
police
department?”
“because
i
fear
that
some
disturbance
might
occur.”
“why
did
you
fear
that?”
“because
it
isn't
customary
for
the
two
races
to
sit
together
and
eat
together.”
so
he
didn't
call
the
police
to
arrest
anybody
and
he
didn't
call
the
police
because
there
was
an
actual
disturbance
or
any
appearance
of
any
disturbance
that
was
beginning
to
brew
up.
he
just
called
the
police
as
a
cautionary
measure
and
certainly
not
to
eject
these
people
from
the
store.
in
fact,
he
didn't
even
--
this
is
in
record
in
which
he
did
not
even
asked
them
to
go
to
the
counter
on
the
other
side.
he
was
content
to
permit
them
to
sit
where
they
were.
i
think
the
state's
argument
in
this
case
now
has
been
made
entirely
clear
in
that
the
state
agrees
with
the
police
officer
as
they
testified.
the
court
--
the
trial
court
as
expressed
in
its
findings
and
implicitly
the
state's
supreme
court
as
it
affirmed
the
trial
court
because
the
argument
of
the
respondent
here
has
been
that
the
petitioners
had
no
right
to
be
there.
that
was
repeated
over
and
over
and
over
again.
the
petitioners
had
no
right
to
be
there
and
we
submit
that
that
is
what
this
case
presents
to
this
court.
the
state
of
louisiana
was
faced
with
a
situation
which
involved
the
sit-in
demonstrations.
the
state
as
a
matter
of
state
policy
expressed
in
a
resolution
as
recently
as
1960,
the
policy
of
the
state
is
segregation,
statement
of
its
governors
as
recently
as
1960,
that
he
will
preserve
segregation
in
the
state.
general
terms,
looked
around
to
see
what
it
could
find
to
apply
to
stop
this
situation.
it
didn't
have
a
trespass
statute
even
if
a
trespass
statute
would
not
be
applicable.
mr.
ward
admits
that
the
tres
--
trespass
statute
would
not
apply
to
the
situation,
had
nothing
else
reached
around
and
got
this
very
general
disturbing
the
peace
statute,
invented
around
to
try
to
fit
this
situation
in
an
effort
to
perpetuate
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
louisiana
as
expressed
by
its
legislature
at
its
most
recent
session.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
something
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
does
not
permit
to
be
done.
