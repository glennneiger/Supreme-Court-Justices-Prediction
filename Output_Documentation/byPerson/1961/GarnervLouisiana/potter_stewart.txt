you
say
they're
boys
and
girls,
their
age
isn't
an
issue
here,
doesn't
it
--
is
there
no
claim
here
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
shouldn't
have
been
dealt
with
as
adults
or
anything
such
as
that
is
there?
justice

no.
justice

stewart
when
ordered
to
leave
by
whom?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
still
in
27?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
under
justice
harlan's
analysis,
you
could
--
you
could
pose
the
question
in
thompson
against
louisville
in
that
same
way.
you
could
say
in
that
case,
it
was
said
it's
necessary
to
read
the
statute
as
though
the
city
of
louisville
has
an
ordinance
saying
that
a
man
with
at
least
record
sitting
in
a
restaurant,
waiting
for
a
bus
and
shuffling
his
feet
was
guilty
of
disorderly
conduct.
the
question
there
whether
it
was
--
such
a
statute
was
--
whether
such
a
statute
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
pose
either
case
in
either
terms,
couldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
that
clear
on
the
record
or
you're
just
gathering
that
that's
clear
from
which
you
might
have
read
the
newspaper?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
a
difference,
isn't
there,
between
the
police
making
their
business
to
be
present
at
a
time
and
place
where
they
foresee
the
possibility
of
violence,
to
be
present
in
order
to
prevent
the
violence,
preventive
practice,
preventive
police
work,
that's
one
thing.
but
--
and
to
arrest
somebody
for
violation
of
this
statute
is
something
quite
different,
isn't
it?
what
you
said
is
directed
to
the
first
--
to
the
first
course
of
action
which
would
be
quite
a
different
course
of
action
for
the
one
actually
taken
by
these
police
officers,
wouldn't

justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ward,
this
--
these
statutes
has
been
on
the
books
of
louisiana
for
good
many
years,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
new
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
has
there
--
has
there
been
any
interpretation
of
--
by
your
state
court,
by
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
subsection
(7)
in
any
case?
justice

that
was

justice

thank
you.
justice

stewart
that's
the
only

of

case
that
you
know

a
decision
that
you
know
of,
involving
subsection
