justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
time
of
these
occurrences,
was
there
a
distinct
or
separate
no
trespassing
statute
in
louisiana?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
ask
--
and
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
--
i
didn't
ask
whether
it
would
be
applicable
to
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
no
trespassing
statute
explicitly
an
expressed
no
trespassing
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
got
the
reference
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
it's
applicable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
greenberg,
before
you
begin
your
argument,
clear
up
some
ignorance
i
have
about
louisiana
law.
it
was
during
--
with
any
one
of
them,
the
briscoe,
i
haven't
had
briscoe
record
before
me,
on
page
56,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
said,
“the
court
is
without
jurisdictions
to
review
facts
in
criminal
cases.”
the
copy
of
the
louisiana
constitution
that
i
(inaudible)
on
a
surface
reading
and
the
reading
of
the
english
words
denied
jurisdiction
perhaps
the
--
perhaps
i
should
ask
the
attorney
general
or
the
counsel
for
louisiana
in
this
case,
denied
jurisdiction
in
criminal
cases
except
for
death
or
life
sentence
and
$300
and
six
months
fine,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
i
don't
see
that
it
has
this
jurisdiction
with
the
facts
of
law
in
this
case,
but
in
the
second
--
and
the
second
question,
perhaps
also
the
attoney
general
who
can
enlightened
me
on,
the
case
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
am
i
right
about
that,
mr.
greenberg?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
--
if
they
--
if
you
see
article
7
section
10
of
louisiana
constitution
of
1921,
well,
if
you
go
and
look
at
it,
i
find
at
least
in
my
copy,
i
don't
(inaudible)
copy
that
the
jurisdiction
doesn't
exist
unless
it
would
be
the
--
a
death
or
a
life
sentence
or
the
$300
fine
and
six
months
sentence,
not
potential
sentences
but
actually
sentences
that
have
been
imposed,
you
know,
so
i
have
trouble
with
that.
and
the
second
one,
am
i
right
that
the
case
of
the
ruling
of
the
district
judge
on
matters
of
law
are
not
erroneous?
am
i
right
that
the
case
which
they
cite,
ponchatoula,
if
that's
the
way
to
pronounce
it,
came
up
before
the
supreme
court
on
an
abstract,
what
i
would
call
a
question
whether
the
statute
on
its
face
is
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they've
told
that
before
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
what's
--
what
underlying
facts
there
were
to
that
judgment,
sentence.
i
ask
these
questions
at
the
outset,
because
for
me,
they
have
great
barring
upon
the
course
of
this
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
discussions
on
the
facts
because
i
suppose
they
were
precluded
by
the
constitutional
provision
which
allowed
them
to
review
merely
questions
of
law,
whether
they
conceived
to
the
questions
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
that's
the
--
i
think
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
may
have
further
enlighten
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
effect
of
section
63
in
the
criminal
code,
r.s.
14:63?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
an
existing
louisiana
statute
which
explicitly
precluded
the
mixture
of
the
races?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
any
one
of
these
to
your
establishment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
disturbance
to
be
found
for
--
either
by
the
arresting
officer
or
the
basis
of
conviction
must
derive
from
the
circumstances
unaided
by
any
specific
declaration
of
public
policy
in
the
form
of
a
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
these
are
the
statutes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
specific
terms
--
never
mind,
for
the
moment
whether
constitutional
or
not,
the
point
of
view
of
state
officers
was
there
a
statute
which
as
such
violated
by
the
student
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
was
a
very
narrow
ground,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
just
like
this
case,
in
the
first
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
pardon
me?
the
real
distinction
on
(inaudible)
basis,
the
sanford
case
dealt
with
behavior
on
the
public
street.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
already
on
enforcing
that
statute
and
secondly
it
dealt
with
an
extradited
religious
views.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
certainly
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
your
first
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
alternative
is
an
alternative,
but
that
would
be
(inaudible)
another
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
where
it
implies
to
which
is
consistently
the
original
statement
namely,
that
your
first
point
is
that
the
case
is
really
the
thompson.
i'm
not
arguing
your
case.
you're
arguing
it
yourself
and
that's
what
you
told
me
a
little
while
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
excluded
it
making
the
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
realistically
means
importing
the
tone
as
you
call
it,
tone
--
the
tone
of
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
couldn't
review
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
asked
you
the
question
initially
because
so
far
as
the
judicial
scope
of
what
supreme
court
did
in
louisiana
steps
right
to
the
thompson
case,
except
in
the
thompson
case,
we
brought
the
case
here
directly
from
whatever
was
the
local
police
court
and
here,
while
there
had
been
some
judgment
by
the
supreme
court
and
tactically
a
denial
of
certiorari,
can
you
put
it
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they've
abstained.
according
to
its
constitution,
it
couldn't
review
it,
unless
and
otherwise
unlikely
and
it
said
so.
that
was
the
situation
in
thompson,
that's
why
we
brought
the
case
here
from
the
court
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
if
it
had
by
certiorari,
a
fortiori,
it
didn't
make
any
adjudication.
justice
felix
frankfurter
second
girard
case
sheds
further
light
on
that
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
come
her
on
appeal
and
dismissed
i
may
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
referring
to
mr.
coleman's
memory
and
--
as
well
as
knowledge
of
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
do
accept
the
tender
of
the
legal
question
which
justice
black's
question
proffered?
you
do
--
do
you
accept
that
is
the
issue
as
raised
by
justice
black
and
that
you
have
said
as
i
understood
you,
namely,
may
the
state
pass
a
statute
intervening
with
are
presence
on,
particularly
in
this
case,
i
mean
with
the
word
“private
premises,”
premise
that's
not
dedicated
to
general
public
use,
where
the
owner
himself
had
no
objection
to
such
presence
or
the
owner
himself
does
not
indicate
that
he
wants
the
person
for
whatever
reason
to
leave
his
premises.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
accept
it
--
i've
rephrased
what
was
questioned
--
admirably
stated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
go
back
--
instead
of
rephrasing
and
we
get
into
the
lawyer's
troubles,
you
heard
justice
black's
question.
do
you
accept
that
that
for
you
the
issue
in
this
case
as
he
put
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
do
not
even
have
a
case
here
to
reverse
of
what
you
and
i
are
talking
about,
namely
where
the
state
takes
affirmative
action
against
certain
discrimination,
this
for
instance,
the
state
the
new
york
in
the
case
we
have
sometime
ago,
we
haven't
got
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
affirmative
action
disallowing
a
choice
that
otherwise
might
deal
--
given
in
that
case
here
either.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
had
such
a
case
some
years
ago,
with
many
years
ago,
in
my
time
and
new
york
required
certain
nondiscrimination,
we
haven't
got
that
case
here
or
have
we
got
the
question
that
justice
black
puts
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
it
does
get
down
as
he
suggested
to
you,
a
discussion
of
the
precise
and
concrete
facts
in
these
three
cases
to
see
whether
they
come
within
what
you
regard
as
the
state
couldn't
do,
namely,
intervene
where
the
state
--
where
the
owner
of
the
so-called
private
enterprise
has
not
himself
intervened,
as
i
understood
his
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
for
me,
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
become
relevant
whether
that
statute
applies?
it
may
become
relevant
because
the
fact
if
--
if
the
record
sustains
a
valid
trespass
statute
in
existence
at
the
time,
the
fact
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
labeled
his
information,
is
that
what
it
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
information,
labeled
his
information
through
--
with
the
citation
to
another
statute
is
irrelevant.
this
court
long
ago
has
held
and
has
held
again
and
again
in
an
indictment
which
the
united
state
attorney
may
think
form
statute
(a)
and
it
couldn't
be
sustained
on
the
statute
(a),
may
as
the
fact
all
sustain
violation
of
statute
(b)
which
is
valid,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
but
you
haven't
got
that
situation
here
as
you
yourself
said
this
couldn't
be
sustained
or
you're
not
arguing
that
it
can
be
sustained
under
the
trespass
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
would
you
not
--
you
have
to
--
for
the
purposes
of
remarks,
i
just
make
you
have
to
argue
that
it
could
be
sustained
under
the
trespass
statute
if
it's
not
sustainable
on
the
breach
of
a
peace
statute.
i
know
you
are
arguing
that
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
least
with
these
statutes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
one
i
asked
you
whether
under
the
breach
of
peace
statute,
disturbing
the
peace,
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
owner
asked
him
or
didn't
ask
him
to
leave,
that
would
the
vital
question
in
the
trespass
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
so
far
as
the
owners,
the
owners
are
concerned,
it
can
only
be
relevant
evidence
for
roughly
disturbing
the
peace
and
he
can't
determine
that,
can
he?
that's
not
for
him
to
determine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
we're
back
as
to
whether
what
evidence
is
there?
what
is
there
on
this
record
which
establishes
the
basis
on
which
the
police
can
intervene,
namely,
disturbance
of
the
peace?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
that
--
to
be
left
for
private
determination,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whereas
the
trespass
statute
does
involve
private
action
or
non-action?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
avow
or
disavow
that
you're
resting
this
thing
on
the
then
existing
trespass
statute,
as
i
understand
you,
you
do
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
so
the
trespass
statute
as
of
the
time
these
occurrences
is
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
use
the
later
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
use
the
later
one,
and
we
cannot
resort
to
the
latest
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you,
that
you
can
sustain.
you
must
sustain
this
conviction,
to
sustain
it
under
14
103
(7),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
involved
and
inquires
to
what
the
nature
of
that
offense
is,
namely,
disturbing
the
peace,
and
how
do
you
establish
that
in
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
does
one
--
yes,
how
--
what
proof
is
necessary
to
make
out
a
disturbance
of
the
peace?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
of
the
statements
offered
and
usually
it
does
offer
when
it
--
under
the
disturbance
of
the
peace
statute,
it
does
offer
evidence
to
show
either
in
fact
there
was
a
disturbance
or
if
it
was
so
obviously
eminent
that
the
conclusions
here
is
almost
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
holding
you
responsible
for
that
because
you
and
i
are
both
limited
to
what
the
record
shows.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
are
you
drawing
on
the
judicial
notice
of
your
court
and
this
court
must
take
in
order
to
establish
the
finding
of
disturbance
of
the
peace?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
judicial
notice
plays
this
part
of
the
law,
but
in
this
case
of
what
must
be
--
or
what
do
you
act
to
take
judicial
notice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
i
know
that
except
for
(inaudible),
like
justice
holmes,
who
never
read
any
newspapers?
how
would
he
have
known?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
respect
your
mind,
but
your
mind
is
not
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
be
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
--
that
wasn't
a
bright
remark,
but
is
irrelevant
remark.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
throughout
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
forgive
me,
how
do
you
get
what
you
--
of
that
which
you
have
private
knowledge
or
local
knowledge,
how
does
that
trans
--
how
is
your
knowledge
transmitted
to
us
on
this
bench
except
--
unless
it
would
be
put
into
the
record,
so
i
can
say,
i
now
know
what
the
local
people
--
why
they
did
what
they
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
might
have
--
they
might
have
--
if
we're
going
to
resort
to
judicial
notice
that
came
to
the
newspapers,
they
might
have
felt
that
this,
one
of
these
department
stores,
would
do
what
other
department
stores
and
the
retails
have
done.
say
well,
i
think
it's
good
business
or
good
ethics,
or
good
sense,
or
avoidance
of
difficulty
to
let
them
sit
there.
that
has
--
that
has
happened
in
southern
institutions,
hasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
how
do
i
know
that
they
might
not
rightfully
have,
i
assume
that
would
be
the
consequence
of
actually
having
their
faces
in
front
of
the
propriety
and
he
consult
with
his
people
and
say,
“well,
let's
stop
this”
for
one
reason
or
another.
how
does
the
fact
that
it
had
been
the
custom
to
segregate
eating
--
eating
opportunities?
how
does
that
legally
--
how
can
i
jump
from
that
fact
with
a
legal
conclusion
that
there
would
be
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
that
knowledge
never
got
into
record
by
his
testimony.
he
wasn't
put
on
the
stand
and
he
didn't
testify,
and
just
speaking
out
loud,
he
didn't
testify,
“we've
had
experience
with
this
thing
only
last
week,”
less
than
so,
and
there
was
right
and
we
had
to
call
on
the
national
guard,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
he
could've
testified
to
those
things,
couldn't
he?
now
the
fact
that
the
policeman
may
have
thought
so,
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
may
have
thought
so,
is
of
no
greater
legal
validity
i
may
say
so,
then
that
you,
doubtless
with
good
reason,
have
said
what
you
said
a
little
while
ago,
said
what
said
what
you
said
a
little
while
ago,
that
you
thought
this
would
happen,
but
that's
what
the
court
proceedings
are
for,
to
bring
out
proof.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
from
that
generality
of
the
situation,
(inaudible)
races
to
a
specific
conclusion
in
a
criminal
case
that
a
riot
is
likely
--
violence
is
likely
to
result,
seems
to
me
to
be
the
rather
large
(inaudible).
in
a
local
town,
state
of
kentucky,
if
i
may
speak
of
kentucky
where
there
--
so
i
read
by
the
papers
or
by
the
books,
there
has
been
local
fuse.
now,
the
local
judge
may
know
exactly
what
will
happen
if
john
smith
goes
to
the
little
robinson's
house,
but
i
shouldn't
think
on
the
basis
of
that
internal
knowledge
that
by
that
knowledge,
john
smith
could
be
arrested
for
a
breach
of
a
peace,
because
the
local
judge
knows
that
if
a
smith
goes
to
robinson
house,
there
would
be
devil
to
pay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
just
put
up
to
you
that
in
a
number
of
towns
and
the
cities
where
there
was
just
a
strong
conviction
as
in
baton
rouge,
i
suspect,
they
did
allow
these
people
to
be
served
and
at
about
the
same
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
will.
so
how
can
i
--
how
can
i
as
a
judge
here
sit
and
know
what
the
situation
in
baton
rouge
was
on
the
mere
fact
that
you
local
people
have
the
right
to
have
a
competent
knowledge
as
to
what
would
happen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
the
local
judge
therefore
had
the
right
to
summon
the
police
authority
and
put
questions
(inaudible)
and
he
didn't.
i'm
not
criticizing
anybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
trying
to
tell
you
my
difficulties
with
this
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
i
agree
with
you
--
suppose
i
agreed
with
you
in
the
answer
you
gave
that
the
owner
didn't
want
them
there
and
indicated
he
didn't
want
them,
suppose
i
agree
to
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
record
sustained
such
finding,
does
that
--
must
i
go
from
that
conclusion
(inaudible)
to
draw
from
that
--
from
that
alone
the
conclusion
that
the
disturbance
of
the
peace
was
in
the
air?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
unlawful
act
only
because
--
within
the
anti-trespass
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
conviction
--
that
was
a
prosecution
brought
under
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
clear
up
my
ignorance
about
louisiana
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
the
constitutional
restriction
upon
your
supreme
court
to
review
only
questions
of
law,
is
that
right,
under
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
a
minute
ago
in
answer
to
justice
stewart's
question
that
in
the
sanford
case,
the
court
found
inadequacy
or
invalidity
on
the
facts,
did
i
mishear
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
now
explain
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
they
didn't
--
therefore,
they
did
have
to
consider
the
fact
or
did
consider,
and
this
is
the
one
turning
point,
was
it,
that
these
events
took
place
on
the
street,
as
one
thing
in
sanford.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
primary
point
and
two,
what
they
did
on
the
streets
have
constitutional
protection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
statute
couldn't
be
applied
to
the
situation
which
if
it
were
so
applied,
would
be
rendered
unconstitutional,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
are
we
getting
any
comparable
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
the
other
question
that
i
asked
mr.
greenberg,
your
court
can't
go
into
the
facts
at
all.
the
supreme
court
has
no
power
to
examine
--
reexamine
the
facts
as
does
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
say
so,
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
total
insufficiency
of
evidence
to
sustain
a
charge,
i
should
think
it's
not
reviewable
--
the
facts
whether
there
is
or
is
not
any
insufficiency
unless
you've
say,
unless
the
supreme
court
says,
which
you
apparently
said
at
least
to
my
knowledge,
that
a
total
insufficiency
raises
the
question
of
law.
we
haven't
got
any
such
situation
on
this
record,
do
we?
they
simply
say,
“we
can't
go
into
the
facts
inside
article
21”
or
whatever
it
is,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
discretionary
jurisdiction,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
then
just
as
matter
of
curiosity,
reading
the
constitutional
provision,
they
wouldn't
have
a
right
--
there
would
be
no
appellate
jurisdiction
here
at
all
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
was
a
sentence
below
the
minimum
set
forth
in
the
constitution,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
of
these
days,
when
the
case
is
all
over
and
disposed
off,
would
you
hitch
that
up
with
your
article
21
of
the
constitution,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
plainly
if
you
have
jurisdiction
only,
the
questions
of
law
in
cases
of
the
capital
offenses
or
murder
or
in
cases
where
the
sentence
actually
imposed
is
more
than
$300
or
six
months
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
one
that
--
that's
in
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
haven't
any
such
thing
here,
do
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
take
care
of
the
fact
that
in
no
criminal
case
they
have
the
reviewing
power
unless
the
sentence
is
at
least
six
months.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
--
what
kind
of
hocus-pocus
of
(inaudible)
to
make
in
six
months,
ten
--
what
is
it?
$10
or
$300,
and
was
there
punishment
here,
sentence
imprisonment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
--
it
wasn't
six
months?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
months?
90
days
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
lawyers
can
do
all
sorts
of
things
in
90
days
equal
six
months?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
we
need
to
take
on
it.
