mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
question
that
is
here
for
the
first
time
that
is
whether
a
longshoreman
who
was
injured
on
a
conceitedly
unseaworthy
vessel
whether
he
may
have
his
rights
against
the
ship
owner
and
his
security
against
the
vessel
vitiated
by
the
facts
that
the
owner
of
the
vessel
demised
it
to
his
stevedore
employer.
may
i
say
that
this
question
although
raised
by
the
respondent
in
the
district
court
does
not
really
arise
in
this
case
until
the
circuit
court's
opinion
because
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
there
was
no
demise.
and
we
contend
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
violated
the
injunction
of
this
court
in
the
mcallister
case
by
reversing
the
district
court
on
evidence
that
was
not
clearly
erroneous.
i
think
perhaps
it'd
be
best
to
state
the
respondent's
argument
in
the
district
court.
the
respondent's
argument
it
was,
the
owner
has
no
personal
liability
because
he
has
demised
his
vessel
to
someone
else.
and
despite
the
injunctions
of
sieracki
and
all
the
cases
of
this
court
that
followed
sieracki
that
an
owner
has
a
non-delegable
duty
to
provide
and
maintain
at
all
times
a
seaworthy
vessels.
a
demise
makes
the
demisee
pro
hac
vice
the
owner
and
therefore
the
owner's
interest
is
cutoff.
therefore
he
has
no
in
personam
liability.
and
the
demisee
who
happens
to
be
covered
by
a
system
of
working
with
compensation
cannot
be
liable
because
he's
been
exonerated
by
workmen's
compensation
and
therefore
this
longshoreman
who
was
injured
exactly
the
same
way
that
sieracki
was
on
an
unseaworthy
vessel
in
navigation
is
just
tough
luck.
he
doesn't
have
any
right.
he
can't
collect
against
anyone.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
yes
your
honor.
the
facts
of
the
case
were
simply
that
this
longshoreman
was
aboard
this
dominican
flag
vessel
in
the
port
of
san
juan,
puerto
rico.he
was
working
on
deck
when
a
shackle
on
the
boom
broke.
the
boom
fell
and
crushed
his
head
and
split
like
a
pineapple,
that's
the
case,
just
what
happened.
no
defense
was
ever
raised
that
the
vessel
was
anything
but
unseaworthy.
the
only
defense
raised
was
that
we're
not
liable
because
there
was
no
in
personam
liability.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
well,
i'm
coming
to
that
your
honor
and
it's
right
now,
the
district
court
had
the
following
evidence
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
that's
right.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
he
was
a
longshoreman
employed
by
the
stevedore
who
came
aboard
just
to
unload
the
vessel.
he
was
a
regular
longshoreman
in
that
puerto
rican
harbor.
he
had
no
other
official
connection
with
the
vessel
as
a
crew
member.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
he
is
an
american
citizen,
resident
of
san
juan,
puerto
rico.
he
was
not
a
dominican
as
all
the
other
members
of
the
crew
were
employees
of
--
under
a
dominican
flag
vessel.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
that's
right.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
none
at
all
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
he
was
not
a
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
--
member
of
the
crew
of
the
vessel.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
well,
the
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
that
is
just
a
matter
of
controversy.
the
district
court
said,
"no,
the
employer
did
not
insure
them
under
the
state
workmen's
compensation
system
as
he
was
required
to
do
under
puerto
rican
law.
they
were
all
citizens
and
the
domiciliaries
of
the
republic
of
the
dominican
republic."
the
captain,
the
master
whose
deposition
was
taken
testified
that
he
was
an
employee
of
the
respondent,
not
of
the
demisee.
he
referred
--
he
never
--
he
said
that
the
indian
worker
was
not
his
fellow
employee
and
he
referred
to
the
stevedore
employer
as
a
completely
third
party
as
not
his
employer.
this
comes
to
answer
mr.
justice
brennan's
question.
and
this
was
the
evidence
presented
by
the
master.
the
--
there
was
also
as
i
stated
before
no
coverage
by
the
stevedore
employer
of
the
crew
under
the
local
compensation
law
which
was
required
and
which
this
court
refused
to
review
last
year.
and
the
operator
was
registered
with
customs
at
being
the
registered
owner
in
the
dominican
republic.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
the
respondent
in
this
case.
the
stevedore
employer
was
the
only
one
who
testified
on
behalf
to
the
respondent.
and
he
testified
that
he
was
operating,
managing
and
controlling
the
vessel.
that
he
had
it
under
a
sort
of
demise
or
he
didn't
do
it
that
way,
what
happened
was
that
the
respondent's
proctor
made
a
series
of
leading
questions
which
the
trial
court
admonished
to
influence
said,
"i
can
give
no
credence
at
all
to
this
testimony.
you
are
putting
words
into
this
man's
mouth.
you
are
mentioning
charter,
charter,
charter,
so
he
finally
says
charter."
so
they
continued
with
this
line
of
testimony
at
the
conclusion
of
which
after
he
had
just
finished
saying,
"i
am
the
operator.
i
am
managing
and
i
am
controlling
the
vessel."
the
district
court
says
in
the
record
and
as
in
page
17
of
the
record,
"i
don't
believe
that
you
were
the
operator
or
in
control
of
the
vessel."
then
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
says
that,
"since
there
was
no
written
charge,
since
there
was
no
tangible
evidence
or
whatsoever
except
this
testimony,
connecting
the
stevedore
employer
to
the
vessel
that
the
evidence
is
too
meager
as
a
matter
to
constitute
a
demise."
and
in
his
findings
fact,
the
trial
judge
found
that
the
respondent
was
the
owner
in
possession
and
control
of
the
vessel.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
that's
in
page
20
your
honor
in
the
record.
the
--
all
of
these
are
within
three
pages
at
record
17,
19
and
20.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
was
aware
of
the
mcallister
case
and
they
avoided
it
from
by
a
bootstrap
doctrine
which
they
said
as
follows."
we
believe
that
the
district
court
believed
the
testimony
of
the
stevedore
employer.
but
we
believed
that
he
made
an
incorrect
legal
influence
from
this
testimony
and
therefore
we
will
not
be
bothered
by
mcallister
at
all,
as
to
the
facts.
we
will
say,
assuming
this
testimony
to
be
credible
of
the
stevedore
employer.
we
say
there
was
demise."
now,
i
submit
that
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
this
power
which
we
say
they
don't
under
the
mcallister
rule.
we
say
this
is
a
completely
new
reading
of
a
--
of
the
evidence
in
a
trial
de
novo
in
an
appellate
court
that
this
is
an
incorrect
statement
of
the
law.
gilmore
&
black
say,
that
a
vessel
under
complete
operation
and
control
where
in
the
hands
of
the
operator
maybe
constituted
a
demise.
but
there
is
no
case
that
i
know
of
decided
by
this
court
that
says
that
a
demise
maybe
created
by
parole.
there
is
a
case
of
the
first
circuit
court
which
says
so
but
that's
dicta
and
that's
back
in
1825.
and
they
said
that
in
that
case
that
a
demise
maybe
created
by
parole.
but
in
that
case,
there
was
actual
written
evidence
of
the
relationship
between
the
parties.
the
one
case,
that
that
case,
that
early
circuit
court
of
appeals
case
said,
that
holds
that
a
demise
maybe
created
under
american
admiralty
law
by
parole
relies
upon
is
a
(inaudible),
which
is
a
massachusetts
case
decided
prior
to
early
1800.
and
in
that
case,
a
demise
was
constituted
by
parole
but
an
in
rem
liability
was
placed
against
the
vessel
anyhow
for
a
breach
of
a
contract
of
freight.
but
that's
jumping
ahead
of
us.
the
definition
of
a
demise
was
in
this
court
in
reed
against
the
united
states
which
it
said
we
must
look
to
what
purposes
will
be
effectuated
by
the
relationship
between
the
parties.
there
was
no
parole
agreement
in
that
case.
but
in
all
of
the
cases
that
have
arisen
as
to
whether
or
not
a
demise
maybe
constituted
by
parole
or
whether
there
must
be
some
evidence
to
reduce
an
agreement
to
writing.
they're
all
cases
between
the
purported
demisor
and
the
purported
demisee.
these
are
questions
with
relations
between
two
contracting
parties.
these
are
not
cases
involving
the
rights
of
a
third
person
as
against
the
vessel.
the
only
cases
that
i
can
think
of
in
all
of
admiralty
law
today
or
the
last
--
since
the
reed
case
where
demises
actually
exist
by
parole
are
the
harbor
craft
in
large
ports
of
the
united
states
like
new
york
and
philadelphia
wherein
these
cases
there
has
always
been
proof
of
a
custom
of
the
industry
to
constitute
the
overcoming
hurdle
of
no
parole.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
i
wouldn't
go
that
far.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
my
point
is
that
the
evidence
such
as
at
is,
is
insufficient
in
law
to
constitute
a
demise
under
the
decision
in
the
reed
case
which
says
we
must
look
to
what
purposes
maybe
effectuated.
and
if
the
relationship
can
be
defined
as
anything
else
but
a
demise
then
it
is
not
a
demise.
and
this
relationship
could
be
defined
as
the
district
court
did
in
--
in
--
during
the
trial
as
perhaps
a
trust
relationship
for
a
man
whom
was
his
friend
and
could
not
leave
the
dominican
republic,
as
perhaps
an
agency
agreement,
or
perhaps
as
a
collector
for
the
owner.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
that
would
not
of
itself
be
the
major
concern.
it
certainly
one
of
the
factors
i
think
to
which
an
admiralty
court
must
determine
whether
a
true
demise
exist.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
there'll
be
no
problem.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
all
the
other
cases
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
that's
right.
and
what
kind
of
evidence
would
constitute
a
demise
i
say
that
the
circuit
court
in
this
case
has
no
basis
for
this
holding
under
any
of
the
decisions
in
american
law.
now,
as
affects
third
parties
because
this
--
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
brennan
there
are
other
things
to
be
considered
if
it
were
just
not
in
writing
i
supposed
that
vis-Ã -vis
the
charter,
the
purported
charterer
and
the
demise,
there
would
be
evidence
as
to
what
kind
of
relationship,
what
they
wanted
to
do
with
the
vessel,
etcetera.
but,
can
it
be
constituted
in
a
case
involving
a
third
party?
in
other
words
this
libellant
comes
into
court
with
a
claim
against
the
vessel
and
against
the
owner.
and
the
owner
through
the
testimony
who
--
who
doesn't
appear
but
through
the
testimony
of
his
stevedore
employer
collaterally
sets
up
a
demise
that
just
doesn't
exist
anywhere
in
which
there's
no
notice
of
anywhere.
neither
the
--
the
libellant
nor
could
a
supplier
or
anybody
who
had
to
service
this
vessel
had
found
out
about
the
demise
because
the
first
evidence
that
anybody
ever
heard
of
the
demise
was
after
a
lawful
suit
brought.
customs
didn't
know
there
was
a
demise.
the
workers
didn't
know
there
was
a
demise.
anybody
who
supplied
services
to
this
vessel
did
so
in
the
name
of
the
owner,
the
only
name
that
was
carried
in
the
letter
--
in
the
captain's
cabin
was
the
only
name
carried
in
customs.
they
were
dealing
at
all
times
as
far
as
they
knew
with
the
owner.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
as
i
understand
--
as
i
understand
it
mr.
justice
stewart
a
demised
charter
is
a
charter
where
the
possession
and
control
are
passed
completely
for
a
stated
term
on
stipulated
sets
of
agreement
to
someone
else
to
operate
for
his
profit
and
to
pay
a
rental
or
surplus.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
i
don't
--
i
haven't
yet
defined
any
difference
in
the
books
between
a
demised
charter
and
a
bareboat
charter.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
i
think
they
are
the
same.
it
differs
only
from
a
voyage
charter
or
a
time
charter
which
are
completely
different
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
--
signs
of
agreement.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
well
your
honor,
i
think
that
all
of
the
cases
are
--
i
might
favor
with
the
exception
of
the
vito
--
vitozi
cases.
i
know
of
nothing
that
stands
up
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
in
the
grillea
case,
we
have
exactly
the
same
fact
situation
where
the
seconds
--
where
there
was
a
demise,
it
was
unquestioned.
the
united
states
government
entered
into
a
demised
agreement
with
moore-mccormack
lines.
they
set
out
of
a
full
charter
with
all
the
rights
as
between
themselves
and
grillea
of
the
longshoreman
sued
the
united
states
of
america
and
the
war
shipping
administration.
and
after
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
--
as
if
it
were
an
in
rem
suit
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
case
was
decided.learned
hand
said
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they're
stevedore
employer,
moore-mccormack
is
also
the
demise
charter
because
the
united
states,
if
it
had
been
a
private
party
would
have
been
liable
in
rem
anyhow.
and
therefore
this
man
has
his
remedy
and
has
leaned
under
the
grillea
--
under
the
sieracki
case
and
as
between
the
rights
of
the
united
states
and
moore-mccormack,
there
was
in
that
case
an
indemnity
agreement.
but
there
need
not
be
because
in
the
barnstable
which
this
court
decided
many
year
ago
was
also
a
written
demised
charter
where
the
demisee
was
operating
the
vessel
and
was
in
collision
with
another
vessel.
there
was
never
any
question
that
the
injured
victim,
the
vessel
that
was
--
was
sunk
or
damaged
as
a
result
of
this
collision
could
collect
in
rem
against
the
barnstable.
the
only
question
that
this
court
decided
as
who
had
ultimate
liability,
the
demisor
or
the
demisee
as
between
themselves?
those
are
the
only
two
people
that
were
before
this
court
in
the
barnstable.
this
court
has
many
times
held
that
an
owner
out
of
possession
and
control
maybe
liable.
the
only
case
mr.
justice
douglas
that
one
doesn't
is
the
south
--
the
district
court
case
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
the
unreported
case
of
vitozi
against
s.s.
platano
upon
which
the
respondent
and
the
circuit
court
relied.
all
other
cases
have
held
as
we
had
--
as
we
are
contending
for.
there
are,
i
might
point
out,
many
situations
where
a
shipowner
may
have
someone
else
operate
a
vessel
for
on
behalf
or
with
him
for
various
purposes.
a
circuit
court
recently
decided
the
mission
san
francisco
cases
which
involved
the
united
states
msts
contracts
with
masters
and
tankers
where
they
would
jointly
held
liable
to
anyone
involved.
then
there've
been
cases
where
the
identity
of
the
employer
was
so
confused
on
the
part
of
the
employer
as
--
so
that
you
could
not
differentiate
whether
a,
b
or
c
was
the
actual
employer
of
a
particular
seaman.
all
were
held
jointly
liable.
so
that,
we
feel
that
on
this
basis
of
that
--
there
was
a
demise
even
assuming
that
the
testimony
of
a
stevedore
employer
was
credible
that
the
circuit
court
erred
and
the
case
must
be
reversed.
the
next
question
that
arises
is
whether
assuming
a
demise,
there
was
in
personam
liability
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner.
now,
here
this
is
a
conflict
between
the
first
and
the
second
circuits
too.
the
first
circuit
had
the
vitozi
case
prior
to
the
southern
district
of
new
york
had
it
in
the
rem
action.
that
was
vitozi
against
balboa
steamship
company.
and
the
first
circuit
decided
that
since
the
owner
had
demised
the
vessel,
he
was
the
--
the
demisee
was
pro
hac
vice
the
owner
and
there
was
no
in
personam
liability.
two
years
later,
the
same
fact
situation
came
up
in
new
york
in
cannella
against
lykes
brothers
steamship
company.
and
again,
mr.
--
judge
hand,
for
the
second
circuit
said,
"no,
the
shipowner
is
liable
because
there
is
a
non-delegable
duty
upon
the
shipowner
at
all
time."
and
in
this
case,
in
its
opinion,
in
the
case
here
before
this
court,
the
first
circuit
admits
it
may
have
been
wrong,
but
only
as
to
an
unseaworthy
conditions
that
preceded
the
demise
not
one
that
supervened
the
demise.
mr.
--
in
the
cannella
case,
judge
hand
says
that
he
saw
no
difference
even
though
in
that
case
was
unquestionably
preceding
the
demise.
but
again,
there's
this
conflict
where
--
which
where
the
first
circuit
stand
and
in
some
boats
again
on
the
vitozi
case.
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
reason
if
this
court
is
going
to
continue
the
humanitarian
policy
of
sieracki
to
say
that
there
is
no
in
personam
liability
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
because
he
has
demised
the
vessel.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
as
between
him
and
the
shipowner,
sir
an
as
between
him
and
a
third
party
if
he
had
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
perhaps
that
he
would
be
jointly
liable.
sir,
he
could
--
could've
been
sued.
this
way
he
couldn't
have
been
sued.
yes,
i
do
think
so.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
they
concede
as
much.
they
say
he
would've
--
he
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
--
was
the
one
at
fault
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
--
but
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
--
only
his
exonerated.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
but
this
is
no
different
than
a
vicarious
liability
statute.
the
state
of
new
york
for
example
says
every
owner
of
a
motor
vehicle
is
liable
for
a
damaged
to
a
third
party
resulting
from
a
negligent
operating
--
operation
of
that
vehicle
no
matter
who
operates
it.
and
they
have
a
compulsory
insurance
law
in
the
state
of
new
york
obligating
the
owners
to
ensure
their
vehicle.
so
that
a
car
rental
agency
in
new
york
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
--
can
rent
its
car
to
a
user
and
have
at
--
and
be
on
the
same
position
as
a
demisor
of
a
vessel
and
yet
they're
held
liable.
and
new
york
has
never
said
that
this
is
such
a
humanitarian
policy
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
yesterday
in
the
decision
on
the
--
on
the
utah
statute,
that
this
is
an
attempt
by
states
and
by
the
national
government
to
cope
with
this
terrible
problem
of
damage
and
injury
to
individuals
and
we
have
here
an
industry
were
they're
being
clabbered
every
day
of
the
week.
now,
these
longshoremen
are
in
the
most
hazardous
industry
in
the
united
states.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
no,
not
--
not
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
not
in
puerto
rico.
the
federal
--
it
has
been
held
that
the
federal
longshoremen
harbor
worker's
compensation
act
does
not
applied
to
puerto
rico.
but
the
local
compensation
act
which
includes
all
workers
in
puerto
rico
has
been
held
to
have
been
delegated
by
congress
to
the
puerto
rican
legislature
and
this
covers
them
as
it
covers
all
of
the
workers.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
yes.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
but
is
--
as
between
the
lessor
or
the
demisor
of
the
charter
and
the
negligent
party,
the
demisor
always
has
his
right
over
whether
it
be
by
indemnity,
contract
or
indemnity-at-law
or
as
they
do
it
the
common
law
states
by
passive
acts
and
tort
fees
so
that
nobody
is
being
punished.
its
just
where
does
the
risk
fall
on
the
innocent
victim
or
the
man
whose
property
is
in
use.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
--
the
court.
before
the
luncheon
recess
we
covered
two
grounds
why
we
felt
that
the
circuit
court
opinion
should
be
reversed.
one
that
it
violates
their
decision
--
violated
the
mcallister
rule
and
secondly
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
no
inference
could
be
drawn
here
that
the
evidence
constituted
a
demise.
i
was
discussing
the
question
of
in
personam
liability
of
the
shipowner.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
recess
and
why
--
i
thought
that
the
decision's
clearly
stated
that
the
in
personam
liability
of
the
shipowner
was
a
continuing
obligation.
this
has
been
the
rule
in
sieracki
and
every
case
--
well,
even
before
sieracki-mahnich
and
in
every
case
decided
since
that
time.
and
this
question
of
personal
fault
of
the
shipowner
has
never
been
brought
to
the
floor
except
recently,
the
first
circuit
did
it
again
in
the
mitchell
case
a
few
years
ago
which
this
court
reversed
and
they
are
doing
it
here
again.
but
i
submit
that
the
personal
liability
of
the
shipowner
here
is
no
different
than
it
was
to
the
shipowner
in
the
pedersen
case
where
the
stevedore
employer
brings
aboard
a
block
that's
defective.
now
for
all
practical
purposes
the
shipowner
has
surrendered
control
to
the
stevedore
to
handle
the
loading
and
unloading
and
yet
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
leased
that
portion
of
the
vessel.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
and
he
has
no
personal
fault
and
yet
he
was
held
liable
in
personam.
in
the
crumady
case,
the
shipowner
provided
what
this
court
said
was
inherently
seaworthy
equipment
but
which
became
unseaworthy
through
the
negligent
operation
of
the
longshoreman.
he
had
no
notice
and
both
the
ship
and
the
shipowner
were
held
responsible
in
rem
and
in
personam.
in
the
mitchell
case,
although
it
involved
seaman,
the
shipowner
had
no
notice
or
could
not
have
prevented
the
condition
and
he
was
held
personally
responsible.
or
in
the
boudin
case
where
this
court
held
that
a
shipowner
could
be
responsible
for
the
unseaworthiness
of
the
crewmembers.
and
i
think
that
we
can
accept
as
a
fact
of
life
that
the
shipowner
has
no
control
over
the
selection
of
these
crew
members.
these
are
selected
in
union
hiring
halls.
he
must
take
who
he
gets
and
yet
he's
held
personally
liable
for
their
actions.
and
in
the
case
of
a
demise
it's
no
different
from
these
other
cases
because
a
shipowner
has
the
same
continuing
interest
in
the
vessel
and
in
its
operation.
if
he
charters
the
vessel
to
someone
else,
during
the
period
of
the
charter
the
shipowner
is
still
collecting
a
rental.
he's
making
money.
he's
still
entitled
to
--
to
deduct
the
depreciation
which
the
operator
doesn't
get
the
credit
for.
he's
also
entitled
to
a
return
of
the
ship
which
the
first
circuit
says
they
don't
think
has
any
bearing
whatsoever
whereas
all
the
other
of
these
cases
that
have
decided
this
question
think
it's
quite
important.
but
under
a
true
demise,
a
one
where
there's
a
charter
party
is
also
entitled
to
periodic
inspections.
he's
entitled
to
survey,
maintenance,
insurance
and
indemnity.
all
these
phases
of
a
charter
party
are
either
assumed
or
taken
for
granted
by
the
first
circuit
that
they
existed
in
this
case.
and
if
they
did,
i
don't
understand
why
he
didn't
have
personal
liability.
and
certainly,
i
can't
understand
why
the
vessel
is
not
liable
in
rem.
this
court
has
held
--
this
comes
to
the
--
to
the
other
holding
of
the
case
that
i
--
was
the
respondent's
argument
from
the
outset,
no
in
personam
liability
on
the
shipowner,
no
in
personam
liability
on
the
part
of
the
demisee
therefore
no
in
rem
liability
even
though
the
man
had
a
maritime
lien
created
at
the
moment
that
he
was
injured
as
a
result
of
unseaworthy
equipment.
this
court
has
held
in
many
situations
that
in
rem
liability
does
not
depend
upon
in
personam
liability.
it
said
so
in
the
piracy
cases,
said
so
in
the
capsizing
cases,
in
the
compulsory
harbor
pilot
cases
and
it
said
so
in
the
charter
parties
which
involved
collisions
like
the
barnstable.
the
respondent
claims
that
all
these
cases
were
based
upon
the
doctrine
that
the
ship
is
an
independent
personality.
and
this
court
shouldn't
follow
this
fiction
any
longer
because
now
we're
in
the
20th
century
and
we
should
do
away
with
fictions
upon
which
the
law
is
based.
they
cite
mr.
justice
black's
opinion
in
the
consumer
credit
case
(inaudible)
315
is
saying
that
fictions,
once
useful,
may
no
longer
apply.
i
submit
that
no
case
has
said
that
they
are
going
to
abrogate
fiction
and
you
must,
if
you
want
to
discard
the
fiction.
you
don't
have
to
base
in
rem
liability
on
the
fact
that
the
ship
is
an
individual
entity
and
that
it
can
commit
wrongs.
what
is
involved,
i
think,
is
a
policy
question.
the
policy
of
sieracki
is
--
and
the
whole
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
is
clearly
set
forth.
i
read
from
page
124
of
this
court's
opinion,
âthese
hazards
of
marine
service
together
with
their
helplessness
to
ward
off
such
perils
and
the
harshness
enforcing
them
to
shoulder
alone,
the
resulting
personal
disability
and
loss
have
been
thought
to
justify
and
to
require
putting
their
burden
insofar
as
it
is
measurable
in
money
upon
the
owner
regardless
of
fault.
those
risks
are
avoidable
by
the
owner
to
the
extent
that
they
may
result
from
negligence.
and
beyond
this,
he
is
in
a
position,
as
the
worker
is
not,
to
distribute
the
loss
in
the
shipping
community
which
receives
the
service
and
should
bear
it's
cost.â
and
i
suggest
and
there's
nothing
creative
about
this,
gilmore
&
black
suggested
put
the
credit
where
it
belong,
that
all
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
where
in
rem
liability
has
been
imposed
in
the
past
where
there
has
been
no
in
personam
liability
has
been
odd
because
of
these
same
policy
considerations.
for
example
in
the
china,
it
--
when
the
ship
--
the
ship
was
held
liable
in
rem
for
the
negligence
of
the
compulsory
harbor
pilot,
this
court
could
have
said
just
as
well
as
--
because
the
ship
is
an
individual
entity,
it
could
have
said
the
shipowner
is
in
a
position
to
ensure
against
these
loss
and
distribute.
so
too
in
the
collision
cases,
the
court
could
have
said
the
shipowner
is
in
a
position
to
collect
from
the
demisee
on
the
basis
of
either
an
expressed
or
an
implied
indemnity
and
so
too
in
the
longshoremen's
cases
were
the
stevedore
employer.
the
shipowner
is
able
to
collect
over
as
against
the
responsible
party
who
committed
the
loss
that
the
burden
should
not
be
placed
upon
the
innocent
victim
who
is
injured
as
a
result
of
an
unseaworthy
condition
to
go
after
somebody
who
he
--
whose
limit
--
whose
liability
may
be
limited
only
as
to
him
or
who
maybe
impecunious.
the
shipowner
holds
himself
out
to
the
world
as
operating
this
vessel.
and
this
court
has
held
that
a
maritime
lien
arises
all
over
the
world
when
people
perform
services
for
the
ship.
and
these
maritime
liens
are
secret,
nonconsensual
liens.
the
respondent
in
this
case
would
say
to
us,
"oh
yes,
somebody
who
provided
diddles
for
the
crew
might
be
able
to
collect
the
li
--
a
maritime
lien
against
the
vessel
because
the
demisee
might
be
liable
in
personam.
but
in
this
case,
the
demisee's
in
personam
liability
is
limited
and
therefore
the
injured
worker
can't
collect
against
the
vessel.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
at
this
moment
that
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
that
has
involved
the
cutting
away
of
the
humanitarian
doctrine
of
sieracki
over
the
past
years.
no
question
in
this
case
of
whether
or
not
the
vessel
was
in
navigation.
there's
no
question
in
this
case
whether
or
not
the
injured
worker
is
within
the
status
of
workers
to
be
prodec
--
protected
by
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness.
the
respondent
claims
that
there
are
two
cases
which
emphasized
--
two
recent
cases
which
emphasized
that
this
personality
of
the
ship
preclude
the
longshoremen
from
recovering.
and
he
cites
noel
against
isbrandtsen
which
is
a
fourth
circuit
case
and
pedersen
against
the
bulklube
which
is
a
second
circuit
case.
in
both
those
cases,
the
questions
were
not
the
questions
that
arise
here.
in
both
cases,
the
sh
--
well,
in
neither
case
was
the
ship
in
navigation.
and
in
neither
case
was
the
worker
entitled
to
a
seaworthy
vessel.
here
we
have
a
right
with
a
correlative
duty
which
was
breached
in
this
case.
and
the
respondent
claims
that
this
can
be
breached
with
impunity.
âand
the
security
which
this
court
has
said
arose
immediately
upon
the
breach
can
be
vitiatedâ,
says
the
respondent
because
the
stevedore
employer
has
a
limitation
of
liability
vis-Ã -vis
the
longshoreman.
the
workmen's
compensation
act
of
puerto
rico
was
designed
just
has
--
just
as
was
the
federal
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
which
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to.
both
of
these
acts
were
designed
to
increase
the
rights
of
the
worker
rather
than
to
limit
them.
both
of
these
acts
provide
for
third
party
actions
against
responsible
parties.
and
although
there
has
been
no
case
in
puerto
rico
saying
that
a
shipowner
who
owns
a
vessel,
the
vessel
is
not
a
third
party
as
there
has
been
in
the
other
states
which
this
--
which
this
court
has
refused
to
grant
cert.
there's
no
case
anywhere
which
except
the
vitozi
against
platano
which
says
that
the
demisee
is
for
all
purposes
the
owner.
and
there
is
no
other
case
that
i
know
of
besides
the
first
circuit
cases
in
this
case
and
in
vitozi
which
say
that
a
non-delegable
duty
of
the
shipowner
can
be
erased.
he
can
contract
it
away.
this
court
said
it
is
specifically
impossible
of
contracting
away.
and
the
first
circuit
says,
"in
all
conditions
except
the
demise."
now,
if
a
maritime
lien
is
entirely
independent
of
possession
is
non-consensual.
and
it's
commonly
said
not
to
be
extinguished
by
transfer
to
a
bona
fide
purchaser
without
notice
of
its
existence
and
it
--
if
it
may
arrive
--
arise
even
though
the
owner
of
the
vessel
in
which
it
subsist
is
not
personally
liable
i
submit
that
it
cannot
be
expunged
in
the
case
at
bar.
in
essence,
there
is
no
difference
between
the
argument
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
and
the
fears
expressed
by
mr.
justice
black
in
his
dissent
in
the
ryan
case.
that
time
when
this
court
held
that
the
shipowner
could
collect
indemnity
from
the
stevedore
employer
that
created
the
unseaworthy
condition
and
which
has
later
been
held
that
--
that
such
an
indemnity
can
be
created
without
a
direct
contractual
relationship
and
without
any
contract.
that
mr.
justice
black's
fear
as
to
what
would
happen
have
come
home
to
roost
here
that
the
shipowner
has
contracted
away
his
liability
to
someone
who
is
exonerated
from
liability,
who
has
no
desire
to
prosecute
against
the
shipowner
on
behalf
of
the
injured
worker
because
he
ultimately
maybe
liable
to
the
shipowner.
and
therefore
the
ship
--
the
individual
injured
workers'
rights
had
been
completely
cut
out
from
the
whole
sieracki
policy.
this
is
a
worker
who
is
in
exactly
the
same
position
and
who
was
injured
exactly
the
same
way
as
sieracki
was.
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here
on
appeal
is
that
although
this
court
never
need
reach
the
in
rem
situation
presented
in
order
to
reverse
that
this
case
is
reversible
solely
upon
the
ground
that
it
violates
the
precepts
of
mcallister.
that
because
the
conflicts
exist
between
the
second
and
third
circuits
and
the
first
circuit
as
to
the
rights
of
a
longshoreman
on
a
vessel
demised
to
the
stevedore
employer
that
this
question
must
be
resolved
because
under
the
same
operative
facts
that
exists
here,
only
better,
in
other
words,
there
was
a
true
demise
charter.
workers
have
been
allowed
to
recover
in
both
the
third
circuit
and
in
the
second
circuit
where
all
of
the
arguments
placed
in
the
opinion
of
the
first
circuit
were
placed
before
those
courts
and
rejected
upon
the
authority
of
the
cases
of
this
court.
and
i
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit
is
clearly
erroneous
and
should
be
reversed.
can
i
save
the
remainder
of
my
time?
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
at
the
risk
of
sounding
irreverential,
i
would
like
to
say
that
mr.
justice
holmes'
discussion
of
the
personality
of
a
ship
in
the
western
maid
was
completely
unnecessary,
the
decision
of
that
case.
that
case
was
decided
as
i
read
it
on
the
ground
that
the
sovereign
cannot
pass
bad
title.
that
case
was
decided
before
the
public
vessels
acts
where
you
could
--
where
the
sovereign
is
now
no
longer
immune
from
suit
so
when
it
had
taken
the
ships
from
private
individuals
and
then
acted
either
give
them
back
or
sell
them,
the
sovereign
was
in
the
position
of
allowing
these
liens
after
retransfer
to
indicate
that
the
sovereign
had
passed
bad
title.
it's
the
same
thing
of
saying
that
a
marshal
sale,
no
different.
and
there
was
no
necessity.
i
think
some
of
the
dissenters
in
that
case
went
up
to
discuss
the
question.
but
at
any
rate
whether
there
was
or
not
justice
holmes
said
it
is
totally
immaterial
that
in
dealing
with
private
wrongs,
the
fiction
however
originated,
that
is
the
fiction
of
personality
of
the
vessel,
is
enforced.
so
that
mr.
justice
holmes
did
not
destroy
the
personality
fic
--
fiction
in
the
western
maid.all
he
did
was
to
say
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
sovereign.
and
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
i
think
that
in
the
canadian
aviator,
limited,
this
court
reaffirmed
its
position
of
following
the
personality
doctrine.
and
mr.
justice
black
in
his
decision
in
continental
said
that
we're
not
going
to
use
it
when
a
act
--
when
an
action
is
brought
both
in
personam
and
in
rem
and
call
it
two
separate
actions
to
avoid
transfer
to
the
jurisdiction
that
is
most
convenient
and
in
the
interest
of
justice.
and
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
personality
doctrine
did
exist
as
the
re
--
for
the
redress
of
other
wrongs.
but
i
would
like
to,
for
a
moment,
point
out
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
of
my
brother
as
to
the
threshold
issue
here
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
demise.
the
captain
of
the
vessel
testified
that
a
deposition
at
which
the
em
--
the
purported
demisee
was
present
and
two
proctors
for
the
respondent
were
present.
he
was
asked,
âby
whom
are
you
employed?â
he
answered,
ramon
ruiz
pichirilo.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
i'm
sorry
page
10,
sir.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
at
the
bottom
of
that
page.
he
was
asked
if
anyone
got
hurt.
and
he
said,
âwell,
yes.
there
was
fellow
there.
an
employee
of
bordas
&
company,
who
is
refilling
the
bags
with
the
corn
that
has
spilled
on
deck
and
suddenly
i
saw
that
the
man
stayed
more
like
this,
etcetera."
on
the
top
of
page
11,
âdid
you
make
out
an
accident
report?â
he
says,
âno
sir.
i
didn't
fill
out
any
report.
he
was
not
my
employee.â
âdid
you
report
it
to
anyone?â
âwell
of
course,
bordas
&
company,
they
hospitalized
him.â
i
submit,
this
doesn't
sound
like
a
man
who
is
being
employed
by
the
demisee.
and
the
demisee
was
present,
refused
to
cross-examine
although
he
had
two
proctors
there.
at
the
trial,
the
demisee
testified.
and
he
was
asked
whether
he
covered
this
captain
under
the
workmen's
compensation,
this
is
at
the
top
of
page
16
sir.
he
was
asked
whether
he
covered
this
man
under
the
workmen's
compensation
because
seamen
must
be
covered
too
under
the
workmen's
compensation
law
of
puerto
rico.
he
said,
âno.â
he
was
asked
whether
he
listed
himself
as
owner
or
operator
with
customs.
so
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
in
writing
its
opinion
says
that,
âwe
believe
the
courtâ,
that
is
the
district
court,
âwas
mislead
by
testimony.â
they
completely
overlooked
the
fact
that
there
was
a
conflict
of
evidence
and
they
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
district
court
said
that
it
did
not
believe
the
testimony
of
the
demisee.
the
demisee
has
been
testifying.
this
is
at
page
17.
the
demisee
has
been
testifying
that
he
was
operating,
that
he
was
managing,
that
he
was
paying
everything.
at
the
very
conclusion
of
his
testimony,
the
court
said
to
counsel
--
to
the
proctor
for
the
respondent,
of
course
you
know
pretty
well
that
the
doct
--
the
doctrine
in
admiralty
that
there
is
a
non-delegable
duty
no
matter
who
was
managing
the
thing
or
who
was
paying
for
the
payroll,
mr.
bordas
clearly
stated
that
the
boat
belong
to
pichirilo.
and
that
pichirilo
isn't
coming
here
is
because
he
can't
leave
the
dominican
republic.
but
he
is
the
owner
and
he
is
the
operator
of
the
boat.
the
proctor
for
the
respondent
said,
âno,
the
owner
not
the
operator.
the
operator
is
bordas
&
company.â
and
the
court
said
clearly,
âthat
maybe
what
you
think.
but
i
don't
believe
that
bordas
is
the
operator.â
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
may
i
suggest
your
honor
that
he
--
that
bordas
has
been
testifying,
âi
operate.
i
manage.
i
control.â
and
the
court
said,
âi
don't
believe
that
you
operate
it
and
manage.â
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
well,
if
he
didn't
believe
these
conclusions,
there
is
also
basis
of
other
testimony
on
which
not
to
believe
it.
there
was
conflicting
testimony.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
that
would
be
so
your
honor
if
there
were
only
uncontradicted
incredible
evidences
but
even
if
this
was
the
problem
and
this
was
the
only
testimony
and
it
was
uncontradicted,
its
credibility
would
still
have
to
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
has
not
given
a
mandate
but
as
i
understand
mcallister,
to
review
uncontradicted
testimony
and
make
a
contrary
determination
on
their
interpretation
of
its
credibility.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
mr.
edgerton
also
lays,
sir,
the
question
of
the
real
problem
that
arise
if
you
kept
in
personam
liability
of
the
shipowner
after
demise.
and
the
only
hypothetical
situation
that
he
saw
was
there
was
a
problem
was
a
case
where
a
seaman
might
sue
his
employ
â
employer,
the
demisee
and
lose
and
then
later
sue
the
shipowner.
and
i
submit
that
if
this
is
not
precluded
by
res
judicata,
it
is
certainly
precluded
by
every
principle
of
collateral
estoppel.
if
he's
suing
on
the
same
operative
facts
for
a
condition
alleged
to
be
unseaworthy,
he
doesn't
get
too
cracked
about
it
against
two
different
people,
one
as
his
employer
and
the
other
as
the
shipowner.
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
straw
man.
there
is
no
prejudice
to
the
shipowner
by
making
him
liable
in
personam
because
he
has
always
the
right
over
against
everybody
who
was
act
â
who
actively
created
any
condition
that
cause
any
harm.
may
i
point
out
that
in
sieracki,
the
court
held
the
legislation,
that
is
the
federal
longshoremen
and
harbor
worker's
compensation
act,
did
not
nullify
any
right
of
the
longshoreman
against
the
owner
of
the
ship
except
possibly
in
the
instance
presumably
rare
where
he
maybe
hired
by
the
owner.
now,
court
went
on
to
say
all
considerations
which
have
given
birth
to
the
liability,
that
is
the
liability
for
unseaworthiness
and
have
shaped
its
absolute
character,
dictate
that
the
owner
should
not
be
free
to
nullify
it
by
parceling
out
his
operations
to
intermediary
employers
whose
sole
business
is
to
takeover
portions
of
the
ships
work
or
by
other
devices
which
would
strip
the
men
of
â
then
performing
it
service
of
their
historic
protection.
now,
i
submit
that
there
is
absolutely
no
difference
here
than
the
argument
in
the
ryan
case.
the
fact
that
there
is
a
demise
doesn't
make
it
any
different
than
if
they're
just
stevedoring
contract.
he
suit
--
sue
the
shipowner,
the
shipowner
says,
âi'm
not
really
personally
liable.
it
wasn't
my
fault.
it
was
the
fault
of
the
man
who
was
in
charge
of
the
vessel
at
the
time.â
and
the
man
in
charge
of
the
vessel
says,
âi
can't
be
held
responsible
because
i
have
to
pay
compensation.
and
it
would
be
unfair
because
i
have
to
pay
compensation
to
hold
the
other
men
because
i
will
have
to
pay
twice.â
and
these
considerations
have
come
up
in
every
one
of
this
demise
cases
since
grillea.
and
these
arguments
of
the
respondent
have
been
rejected
by
every
court
because
it's
the
same
argument.
in
reed
against
the
yaka
which
is
cited
at
pages
16
and
17
of
petitioner's
brief,
the
court,
this
is
the
pennsylvania
district
court
said,
âwe
simply
point
out
that
whatever
bundle
of
rights
in
the
ship
the
real
owner
surrenders
under
a
bareboat
charter
he
does
retain
the
right
to
the
return
of
the
ship
at
some
future
date.â
moreover,
the
question
of
operation
and
control
of
the
ship
would
appear
to
have
no
real
significance
in
an
in
rem
action
for
unseaworthiness
since
unseaworthiness
is
not
based
upon
negligence
or
any
wrongful
act
rather
it
is
a
form
of
absolute
liability
which
is
imposed
regardless
of
fault,
goes
on
to
say
that
they
are
not
persuaded
by
the
nature
of
a
bareboat
charter,
envisage
--
they
envisage
a
situation
in
which
there
is
no
indemnity
contract
just
like
we
have
in
the
case
at
bar.
and
they
say,
âthe
only
difference
in
such
a
case
and
the
case
that
they
were
having
was
the
indemnity
clause",
which
they
held
at
ryan
determine
it.
they
point
out
that
the
second
circuit
has
considered
grillea
since
its
inception
--
since
its
writing.
and
they
have
--
and
mr.
justice
or
rather
judge
hand
quotation
in
the
latus
case
is
quite
clear,
says
we
can
find
no
decision
in
which
such
a
lien
has
been
posed
on
a
ship
for
fault
of
another
person
other
than
the
owner
when
the
fault
is
not
that
of
a
bareboat
charter
or
some
specified
class
of
a
person
like
a
compulsory
pilot
citing
grillea.
and
then
he
goes
and
says,
âgrillea
merely
held
that
a
longshoreman
might
sue
a
ship
in
rem
if
he
was
injured
by
her
unseaworthiness.â
so
that's
what
we've
got
here.
we
got
a
man
injured
by
the
unseaworthiness
of
a
vessel.
and
they
say
that
we
can't
sue
them
in
rem
anymore
because
we're
the
only
kind
of
people
who've
lost
our
lien
against
the
vessel.
of
course,
you
may
only
say
that
there's
no
need
to
ever
consider
the
argument
last
mentioned
by
my
colleague
because
if
you
agree
that
the
findings
of
the
district
court
were
not
clearly
erroneous,
you've
got
a
judgment
against
two
responsible
parties
and
who
have
posted
a
supersedeas
amount
for
any
excess
amount
as
between
the
both
of
them
so
that
you
--
no
one
could
ever
reach
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
liability
is
limited
in
rem
to
$20,000
because
you
got
two
respondents
both
of
whom
are
liable,
that
is
the
in
personam
respondent
and
â
and
the
in
rem
respondent
and
they
have
posted
security
which
has
substituted
for
the
vessel.
and
this
action
on
appeal
is
a
--
shows
an
action
against
that
security.
thank
you.
