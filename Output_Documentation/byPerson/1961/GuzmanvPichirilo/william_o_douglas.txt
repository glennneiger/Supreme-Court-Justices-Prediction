justice
william
o.
douglas
is
the
only
--
the
only
decision
on
your
side
of
the
case
in
your
favor
of
the
learned
hand
opinion
(inaudible)?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
did
mention
in
the
grillea
case
that
this
was
a
matter
of
first
impression.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
it
--
didn't
that
involve
questions
of
sovereign
immunity?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
suppose
of
any
doubt
as
to
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
he
said
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
he
said
in
that
case,
i
just
happen
to
be
reading
it
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
the
personality
of
a
public
vessel
is
merged
in
that
of
the
sovereign.
i
suppose
that
--
there's
no
relevancy
here,
does
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
personality
of
a
public
vessel
is
merged
in
that
of
the
sovereign.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you're
talking
about
the
fiction
of
the
vessel
things,
i
think.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
we
should
take
our
law
from
the
majority
opinion
up
in
the
dissent
then,
are
we?
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
is
--
was
just
a
little
footnote.
