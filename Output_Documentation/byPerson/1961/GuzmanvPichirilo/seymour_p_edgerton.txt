mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
i
should
spend
a
few
minutes
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument
here
on
the
question
of
the
demise
charter.
the
district
judge
after
having
heard
the
testimony
said
in
his
opinion
at
page
19
of
the
record
here,
and
i'm
quoting,
"i
can
find
no
lawful
basis
for
holding
that
the
vessel
was
under
a
demise
charter
to
bordas
&
company.
the
court
of
appeals
treated
that
language
and
we
think
rightly
treated
it
as
in
effect
a
ruling
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
on
which
to
make
the
finding
which
would
be
equivalent
to
a
directed
verdict
against
the
finding
in
a
jury
tried
case.
now,
if
that
--
if
we
are
correct
in
that
interpretation
of
what
the
district
judge
did
there
is
we
think
no
conflict
with
mcallister
here
where
he
is
overturn
--
where
the
court
of
appeals
is
overturning
the
district
judge
on
a
ruling
of
law
on
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
now,
thereafter
having
made
the
ruling
--
having
made
the
correction
of
the
ruling
of
the
district
judge,
the
court
of
appeals
proceeded
to
make
a
finding
which
was
that
a
demise
charter
existed.
and
it
did
that
on
the
testimony
--
on
the
only
testimony
which
was
offered
in
the
district
court
in
connection
with
the
demise
situation
which
was
that
of
manuel
bordas,
a
partner,
i
think
he
calls
himself
a
director-partner
of
bordas
&
company,
the
charter.
and
the
testimony
there
was
uncontradicted.
he
--
the
testimony
was
that
bordas
&
company
had
been
operating
this
vessel
for
about
five
years
that
it
paid
the
owner,
a
citizen
of
the
dominican
republic
$200
a
month
for
the
use
of
the
vessel
and
that
it
paid
all
of
the
expenses
of
the
vessel.
and
mr.
bordas
enumerated
them
at
--
to
some
extent
or
rather
extensively
his
testimony
appears
at
pages
13,
14
--
13,
15
and
16
of
the
record.
what
he
says
is,
“i
pay
the
crew.
the
master
makes
up
the
payroll
and
i
pay
every
15
days.
he
pays
the
seamen.
we
also
give
him
the
money
for
the
rations
or
the
feeding,
all
the
operating
expenses
of
the
vessel.”
on
page
13,
he
says,
“i
mean
paying
the
payrolls,
the
captain's
salary,
all
the
payrolls,
the
food
of
the
crew,
the
fuel,
the
maintenance
or
repair,
the
dry
docking,
the
insurance
and
the
port
charges
and
all
the
expenses
that
go
with
the
operation
of
a
vessel.”
my
brother
referred
to
counsels
asking
leading
questions
in
the
district
court
and
the
record
indicates
plainly
that
the
district
judge
tried
counsel
for
leaving
the
witness.
the
district
judge
however
did
not
strike
the
testimony.
he
simply
told
counsel
that
he
--
that
counsel
was
testifying
in
effect
as
to
a
conclusion.
but
he
then
left
bordas
--
this
witness
testify
as
to
what
the
type
of
charter
was.
and
we
submit
that
on
--
oh,
i
should
add
this,
the
only
evidence
which
could
possibly
be
said
to
be
contrary
to
this
testimony
was
one
word
in
the
testimony
of
the
master
captain
laurea
who
said
that
he
was
employed
by
the
respondent
pichirilo.
now,
bordas'
testimony
was
that
laurea
--
captain
laurea
was
appointed
by
the
respondent
but
that
he
is
under
my
orders
and
under
my
payroll.
and
i
think
perhaps
this
brings
me
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
asked
of
my
brother,
which
was
as
to
the
nature
of
a
demise
charter.
and
i
think
it
can
be
best
put
in
this
way
that
where
the
owner
of
the
vessel
surrenders
the
possession,
navigation
and
control
of
the
entire
vessel
to
the
charterer,
the
charter
is
a
demise.
now,
it
need
not
be
a
bareboat.
the
typical
demise
is
that
of
a
bareboat.
there's
nothing
aboard.
they
just
give
them
the
boat
and
say,
"you
put
on
the
fuel,
the
stores.
you
get
the
crew.
you
get
everything
else."
but
this
court
held
many
years
ago
and
or
a
good
many
years
ago
in
united
states
against
shea
that
the
demise
situation
arose
even
though
the
master
and
crew
were
both
furnished
by
the
owner.
but
where
the
complete
control
of
the
demise
vessels
was
in
the
demisee
which
in
that
instance
was
the
united
states
--
i'm
trying
to
find
it
here,
yes,
the
dem
--
dem
--
the
demise
was
to
the
united
states
and
the
vessels
were
operated
in
new
york
harbor.
the
representative
was
the
united
states.
i
think
someone
in
the
war
department
told
them
what
to
do,
where
to
go,
everything,
controlled
the
master
and
controlled
others.
and
the
text
writers
all
agree,
robinson
and
his
hornbook
on
admiralty
and
gilmore
&
black
all
agree
that
while
a
demise
is
usually
of
a
bareboat,
it
need
not
be
so.
and
where
here,
the
only
evidence
is
that
the
--
that
bordas
&
company
controlled
the
entire
vessel,
paid
all
of
the
expenses
and
that
although
the
master
was
appointed
by
the
respondent,
he
was
under
the
orders
and
under
the
payroll
of
the
charterer,
we
think
lead
to
only
one
conclusion
in
that
direction
which
was
that
the
vessel
was
under
demise
to
bordas
&
company.
now,
of
course,
that's
funny.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
no,
sir.
he
--
the
only
testimony
of
the
master
in
connection
with
anything
except
the
accident
--
that
the
facts
of
the
accident
itself
was
--
he
was
asked,
page
15
--
i
am
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
i'm
looking
at
the
wrong
place.
he
wasn't
asked
of
any
rate
about
anything
except
whose
employee
he
was
and
he
said
that
he
was
employed
by
the
respondent.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
he
was
--
he
was
the
respondent's
witness,
was
he
not?
my
brother
corrects
me.
he
was
the
libellant's
witness.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
not
on
that
point
at
all
or
in
--
no
--
none
whatever.
of
course
the
--
this
demise
situation
lies
at
the
very
threshold
of
the
case
because
if
there
wasn't
any
demise,
the
case
is
over
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
that's
right.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
now,
we
--
our
next
point
is
that
a
general
owner
who
has
demised
this
vessel
is
not
liable
in
personam
for
an
unseaworthy
condition
arising
after
the
demise
takes
effect.
we
are
not
quarrelling
in
any
way
with
sieracki
against
sea
shipping
company
or
the
alaska
steamship
company
against
petterson
case.
this
court
has
never
held
and
that
so
far
as
i
am
aware
has
never
had
presented
to
it
for
holding
who
the
owner
is?
who
has
the
obligation
of
providing
a
seaworthy
vessel?
and
when
i
say
who
the
owner
is,
i
mean
whether
it
is
the
--
whether
in
a
demise
situation,
it
is
the
general
owner
who
has
parted
with
the
possession
and
control
of
this
vessel
which
was
then
seaworthy
and
the
sea
worthiness
--
unseaworthiness
later
arises
or
whether
it
is
the
demisee
who
has
taken
complete
possession
and
control
of
the
vessel.
and
we
submit
that
by
accepted
principles
of
maritime
law
accepted
for
many
years
by
this
court
and
other
courts
in
england
and
elsewhere.
the
demisee
assumes
and
is
--
and
has
placed
upon
him,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
personal
responsibilities
of
ownership
which
in
the
absence
of
a
demise
would
be
upon
the
crew
or
general
owner.
and
it
is
our
position
that
where
as
here
and
it
is
uncontested
here
that
the
unseaworthiness
arose
long
after
the
demise
and
shortly
before
this
man
was
injured.
our
position
here
is
that
the
charterer,
bordas
&
company
who
happened
to
be
the
employer
of
the
injured
man
had
the
personal
responsibility
for
unseaworthiness.
and
i
think
perhaps
right
here,
i
should
pause
for
a
moment
and
speak
briefly
about
this
court's
decision
in
crumady
against
the
joachim
hendrick
fisser
which
was
decided
in
1959.
that
case
has
been
referred
to
by
various
courts
including
this
one
on
one
occasion
at
least
as
a
case
which
involved
a
demise
charter.
and
briefly,
the
situation
was,
and
my
brother
referred
to
this
case
in
his
argument
briefly
the
situation
was
that
the
winch
on
the
vessel
was
set
for
a
--
the
automatic
pedal
of
the
winch
was
sat
first
for
--
for
a
six-ton
working
load
and
the
hatch
runners
and
wires
were
certified
for
a
three-ton
safe
working
load
and
the
winch
continued
to
operate
and
the
gear
parted.
now,
crumady
as
i
say
has
been
cited
and
spoken
of
as
though
it
involved
the
demise.
and
we've
searched
the
record
in
this
court
and
the
briefs
of
counsel
and
have
been
unable
to
discover
anything
in
any
of
them
which
have
indicated
that
there
was
any
demise.
this
court
in
deciding
the
case
said
that
the
cut
off,
automatic
cut
off
of
the
winch
had
been
set
by
servants
of
the
vessel
who
were
crew
members
and
if
that
were
so,
servants
of
the
owner
and
if
that
were
so,
then
there
was
no
demise
because
the
crew
would
have
been
servants
of
the
demisee
and
not
of
the
owner.
we
have
referred
in
our
brief
to
the
pleadings
in
the
crumady
case
as
that
they
appear
in
the
record
here
and
also
to
the
cross-petition
for
certiorari
there
where
the
petitioner
says
that
it
was
a
time
charter
and
we're
convinced
that
it
was.
i
believed
that
was
an
inadvertence
that
this
court
said
in
waterman
against
dugan
&
mcnamara
in
1960
that
the
person
who
employed
the
stevedore
in
the
crumady
case
was
operating
the
ship
under
a
charter.
it's
misleading
if
--
if
that
was
a
demise
charter
then
again
we've
had
it
here
because
that's
a
decision
that
takes
care
of
this
situation
either
in
personam
or
in
rem
and
perhaps
both
but
i
am
convinced
that
that
was
not
so.
and
that
that
statement
in
the
waterman
case
was
inadvertence
particularly
since
this
court
had
said
in
west
against
the
united
states
in
1959
that
in
crumady
the
vessel
was
in
control
of
the
owner
and
held
that
he
was
liable
for
unseaworthiness
and
negligence.
i
--
sorry
to
take
so
much
time
with
that
but
i
think
it
should
be.
well,
i
--
now
my
brother
i
think
has
said
that
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
first
and
the
second
circuit
as
to
the
liability
in
personam.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
sir
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
well,
my
argument
as
to
mcallister,
your
honor,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
overturn
a
finding
of
fact
of
the
district
judge
on
the
ground
that
the
finding
was
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
and
it
seems
to
me
correctly
that
the
judge
had
ruled
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
on
which
he
could
make
the
other
finding,
in
other
words
as
--
as
though
it
were
a
directed
verdict
in
a
jury
case.
now,
he
--
the
district
judge
in
his
opinion,
far
from
indicating
that
there
was
lack
of
credibility
involved
in
what
the
district
judge
had
done.
he
said
in
his
opinion
which
appears
at
pa
--
on
page
19
of
the
record
in
discussing
this
demise
situation,
he
says
than
no
written
charter
had
been
produced.
and
then
he
says
mr.
luis
manuel
bordas,
director-partner
of
bordas
&
company,
the
punitive
demisee
admitted
there
was
no
charter
and
that
his
company's
relation
with
the
vessel
was
something
like
a
charter
but
not
a
charter.
well,
there
is
no
such
testimony
in
the
record.
the
district
--
the
testimony
which
the
trial
judge
was
referring
to
there
i
believe
was
the
testimony
of
this
witness
that
this
was
not
a
regular
charter
but
it
was
like
a
charter
and
that
appears
on
page
15
of
the
re
--
it
is
a
kind
of
charter
because
it
does
not
comply
with
the
regular
provisions
of
the
charter.
he
had
just
been
telling
the
court
what
the
provisions
of
the
charter
were.
and
we
submit
that
he
was
clearly
distinguishing
between
a
time
or
voyage
charter
on
the
one
hand
and
a
demise
on
the
other.
perhaps,
i
got
away
from
your
question
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
yes
sir.
and
that's
the
only
possible
factual
finding
was
the
one
which
the
court
of
appeals
then
made.
and
there
was
no
point
in
sending
it
back
with
the
direction
for
that
finding
to
be
made
below.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
well,
only
your
honor
because
the
evidence
was
uncontradicted
and
the
court
of
appeals
felt
could
support
only
one
possible
conclusion.
that
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
well
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
i
think
that
would've
presented
a
different
question
your
honor
and
that
--
that
that
would
have
presented
the
mcallister
situation.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
well,
if
the
district
judge
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i've
got
this
quite
straight
your
honor,
but
if
the
district
judge
found
on
the
basis
of
credibility
or
on
the
basis
of
inadequacy
of
the
bordas'
testimony
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
--
pressing
this
bordas'
testimony
or
some
other
reason
that
there
was
no
demise,
i
think
that
would
have
to
stand
and
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
have
changed
them.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
yes,
sir.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
well,
they
--
they
thought
it
was
very
plain
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
--
and
if
they're
wrong
about
that
then
they've
made
a
mistake.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
i
don't
think
they
can
if
it's
sustainably
open
your
honor.
and
if
that's
the
--
the
proper
reading
of
the
evidence
then
it
must
go
back.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
i
think
you're
correct.
that
would
have
to
be
done.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
well,
i
think
it
mean
--
i
think
it
means
that
you
must
decide
--
yes,
i
--
i
believe
it
comes
down
to
that.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
i
think
it
does.
it
gets
down
to
that.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
yes
sir.
i
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
yes.
in
the
waterman
case,
this
court
referred
to
the
fisser
case.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
and
in
that
reference
said
that
in
the
fisser
case,
the
stevedore
was
employed
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
but
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
that's
correct.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
yes
sir.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
that's
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
that's
right.
i
thought
it
might
be
inadvertence
particularly
in
view
of
what
this
court
had
said
in
west.
that
in
--
in
speaking
of
crumady
and
west,
the
year
before
it
said
that
in
crumady
the
vessel
was
in
the
control
of
the
owner.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
it
was,
sir.
it
was
an
action
in
rem.
and
that
is
why
i
say
that
if
i
am
mistaken
about
the
nature
of
the
charter
that
existed
in
the
fisser
case
that
it
is
authority
against
my
position
here.
i
was
referring
to
my
brother's
statement
that
the
first
and
second
circuits
were
in
disagreement
as
to
the
liability
of
the
general
owner
for
unseaworthiness
arising
after
the
demise.
and
i
think
that
is
incorrect.
and
the
case
is
now
stand
in
this
way
that
in
the
vitozi
against
balboa
steamship
company
in
1949,
the
first
circuit
held
that
the
demisor
was
not
responsible
for
unseaworthiness
whenever
it
happened
either
before
or
after
the
demise.
in
cannella
against
lykes
brothers,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
said
they
agreed
that
the
general
owner
wouldn't
be
liable
for
unseaworthiness
arising
after
the
demise
but
that
he
was
liable
for
unseaworthiness
existing
at
the
time
of
or
before
the
demise.
in
the
instant
case,
the
first
circuit
agree
--
well,
the
first
circuit
says
that
perhaps
it
went
too
far
in
vitozi
in
saying
that
the
demisor
would
not
be
liable
for
unseaworthiness
existing
at
the
time
of
the
demise
but
says
that
as
to
unseaworthiness
existing
after
the
demise,
the
demisor
is
not
liable.
and
grillea
against
the
united
states
that
much
discussed
case
in
this
area,
in
the
first
grillea
decision
and
its
important
to
note
that
there
were
two.
and
the
first
one
by
judge
learned
hand
in
229
f.2d,
he
ruled
and
it
was
the
result
of
that
decision
that
the
demisor
was
not
liable
in
personam
for
unseaworthiness
which
arose
after
the
demise
so
that
in
grillea
and
in
the
instant
case,
the
first
and
second
circuits
are
in
agreement.
now,
the
difficulty
with
grillea
came
later
because
there
was
a
rehearing
and
the
question
of
the
in
rem
phase
then
came
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
but
as
far
as
the
in
personam
aspects
are
concerned,
we
think
that
the
general
owner
who
has
demised
his
vessel
is
not
personally
responsible
for
this
supervening
unseaworthiness.
and
that
we
think
is
consistent
with
long
standing
thinking
--
legal
thinking
and
general
admiralty
doctrine
of
the
division
of
responsibilities
as
between
an
owner
who
has
demised
his
vessel
and
a
charterer
who
has
taken
the
entire
possession,
control
and
navigation
under
the
demise.
and
it
--
it
strikes
me
as
rather
interesting
perhaps
that
if
--
seems
to
me
that
if
the
general
owner
remains
liable
for
unseaworthiness
supervening
after
he
has
demised
a
seaworthy
vessel,
he
maybe
in
this
situation
and
if
--
if
a
seaman
sues
his
employer
the
--
the
demisee
of
the
ship,
his
employer,
under
the
jones
act
and
he
has
a
jury
trial
and
he
alleges
unseaworthiness
and
negligence
and
he
loses,
he
could
still
proceed
under
the
general
maritime
law
against
the
general
owner
for
the
same
unseaworthiness.
and
i
don't
see
how
there
could
be
any
res
judicata.
the
parties
are
different.
the
--
there's
no
identity
of
interests.
i
speculated
as
to
whether
or
not
that
might
not
result
from
a
view
that
the
general
owner
continued
to
retain
his
obligation
for
later
unseaworthiness.
the
same
thing
might
happen
to
--
as
respect
to
cargo
where
there
was
a
bill
of
lading
exception
to
which
the
general
owner
was
not
a
party.
now,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
question
here.
in
fact,
i'm
sure
that
none
has
been
raised
but
that
bordas
&
company,
the
demisee
of
the
vessel
and
the
employer
of
the
injured
longshoreman
was
fully
covered
by
the
workmen's
accident
compensation
act
of
puerto
rico.
the
demisee
had
qualified
under
the
act.
the
--
he'd
--
he
--
he
had
done
whatever
was
necessary
to
ensure
himself
with
what
is
called
the
“state
insurance
fund”
which
is
the
same
thing
as
the
compensation
board
of
puerto
rico.
and
the
evidence
has
perfectly
claimed
that
the
libellant
had
received
his
final
award
and
had
got
everything
which
the
law
of
puerto
rico,
the
workmen's
com
--
compensation
act
provided
to
him.
now,
the
approach
of
this
situation,
it
seems
to
me,
lies
in
the
situation
which
develops
--
where
if
the
general
owner
is
not
liable
in
personam
for
supervening
unseaworthiness
and
the
liability
of
the
demisee
for
an
injury
resulting
for
unseaworthiness
has
been
validly
limited
by
a
valid
compensation
act
whether
under
those
circumstances,
the
vessel
can
nevertheless
be
liable
in
rem.
and
contrary
to
what
was
said
in
the
argument
of
the
--
for
the
petitioner
or
i
--
i
shouldn't
say
contrary
but
let
me
say,
i
know
of
no
decision
of
this
court
placing
civil
liability
on
a
vessel
in
rem
where
no
one
was
liable
in
personam.
and
the
case
that
goes
the
farthest
in
that
direction
in
my
knowledge
is
the
china,
the
compulsory
pilotage
case
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment
or
two.
but,
if
there
is
to
be
liability
on
the
ship
in
rem
where
the
general
owner
is
not
liable
to
law
and
the
demisee's
liability
has
been
statutorily
and
completely
li
--
and
as
so
limited
completely
satisfied,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you've
got
to
take
the
position
that
you
are
going
to
go
all
the
way
with
this
theory
of
personification
which
is
so
much
in
the
literature
of
the
admiralty
but
which
--
when
it
comes
down
to
the
application
to
actual
cases
has
been
discarded
by
this
court
frequently
and
it
seems
to
me
it
has
been
discarded
when
the
following
of
the
admittedly
fictive
nature
of
the
personification
theory
would
lead
to
results
which
appear
to
be
inequitable,
unjust
and
to
create
illogical
and
inconsistent
situations.
the
--
i
think
--
i
think
i
might
properly
say
here
that
courts
of
appeals
for
three
circuits
starting
with
the
fifth
circuit
in
1933
in
samuels
against
munson
line
and
going
to
the
third
circuit
in
1952
in
smith
against
the
mormacteal
and
to
the
second
circuit
in
1958
in
bennett
against
the
mormacteal,
those
cases
are
all
on
page
17
of
our
brief.
in
those
cases,
the
courts
of
appeals
held
that
where
the
owner
was
doing
his
own
stevedoring,
where
the
owner
employed
his
own
longshoremen
and
where
the
owner
was
consequently
relieved
to
personal
liability
by
the
terms
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
the
ship
was
not
to
be
subjected
to
in
rem
liability
and
that
was
done
on
two
primary
basis
that
it
wasn't
the
third
person
under
the
act
but
more
properly
that
you
are
trying
to
do
by
indirection
much
you
couldn't
do
directly
that
taking
the
man's
property
to
satisfy
--
taking
the
man's
property
by
way
of
a
maritime
lien
to
give
it
to
the
longshoreman,
you
are
giving
the
longshoreman
from
his
employer
what
the
longshoreman's
act
said
that
you
should
not
do.
well,
your
honor
that
raises
a
rather
difficult
area
to
say
the
least.
in
his
second
grillea,
he
said
that
as
a
matter
of
first
impression
he
saw
no
reason
why
you
shouldn't
take
a
man's
property
to
satisfy
somebody
else
even
though
nobody
was
personally
at
fault.
but
then
he
went
on
and
he
discussed
an
indemnity
agreement
which
existed
in
that
case
and
perhaps
i
better
go
into
the
facts
just
a
little
bit
of
--
in
grillea,
the
united
states
had
chartered
the
vessel
to
an
operator
which
did
its
own
stevedoring.
the
operator
employed
grillea.
grillea
was
injured
through
an
unseaworthy
condition
which
occurred
or
which
arose
a
very,
very
short
time
before
he
was
hurt.
it
was
a
matter
of
hatch
boards
being
placed
back
over
the
hatch
in
a
wobbly
way
or
the
wrong
side
up
so
that
when
grillea
stepped
on
them
a
few
minutes
later,
down
he
went
and
he
was
injured.
and
as
i
said
in
the
first
grillea
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
united
states
was
not
liable
in
personam
for
that
unseaworthiness.
and
the
second
grillea
arose
on
rehearing.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach
any
in
rem
question
in
the
first
case
because
it
felt
that
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
there
had
been
no
adequate
election
to
proceed
as
though
on
--
to
proceed
on
principles
of
libels
in
rem
which
i
think
is
the
wording
of
the
statute.
then
on
rehearing,
the
court
felt
that
there
has
been
a
sufficient
election
in
the
libel
because
of
their
having
alleged
that
the
vessel
now
was
or
during
the
pendency
of
process
will
be
within
the
district
and
various
other
things.
so
they
said
there
was
an
adequate
election
to
proceed
in
personam
and
to
proceed
as
though
in
rem
and
that
was
done.
now
in
the
charter
between
the
united
states
and
the
demisee
whose
name
escaped
me
for
the
moment,
one
of
the
shipping
companies.
there
was
a
provision
that
the
demisee
would
indemnify
the
united
states
for
any
liens
arising
during
the
demise.
and
somehow
or
rather,
judge
hand
seemed
to
feel
that
because
there
was
an
agreement
to
indemnify
the
united
states
against
liens
that
that
was
a
sufficient
phases
for
saying
that
a
lien
existed.
i
don't
follow
it.
other
courts
have
had
difficulty
with
it.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
well,
the
second
circuit
in
bennett
against
the
mormacteal
which
was
decided
by
judge
abruzzo,
i
think
in
the
district
referring
per
curiam,
he
said
that
he
didn't
know
what
it
meant
and
that
in
the
bennett
case,
they
didn't
feel
that
the
decision,
i
may
not
be
putting
this
quite
correctly,
but
they
didn't
feel
brearley
helped
the
many
in
that
situation
and
in
this
case
of
pedersen
against
the
bulklube
also
decided
fairly
recently
in
the
second
circuit.
they
declined
to
find
in
rem
liability
on
the
vessel
for
the
negligence
of
a
shipyard
which
was
completely
in
control
of
the
vessel
but
which
was
protected
against
its
employee
by
the
compensation
act.
it
is
my
feeling
and
i
think
probably
so
that
the
second
circuit
has
backed
away
from
grillea
in
those
two
decisions.
and
there's
a
third
one
which
i
did
not
cite
in
my
brief
but
which
is
in
a
footnote
to
petitioner's
brief
which
is
latus
against
--
somebody
--
latus
against
the
united
states.
that
is
also
an
opinion
by
judge
learned
hand
in
1960.
there
of
course,
the
vessel
was
out
of
navigation.
it
was
--
so
the
no
lien
arose
but
he
referred
to
the
grillea
case
and
he
said
of
grillea
that
--
that
a
longshoreman
has
a
lien
against
the
vessel
for
unseaworthiness
which
no
one
denies.
and
i
think
no
one
denies
it
whether
there
is
no
complica
--
complication
of
an
owner
who
has
let
a
seaworthy
vessel
and
a
demisee
who
is
protected
by
the
compensation
act
and
under
whose
--
each
is
the
--
unseaworthiness
arises.
but
we
don't
--
we
don't
feel
that
there's
much
of
anything
left
to
grillea.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
there
really
was
anything
very
much
in
this
rather
circular
business
of
saying
that
because
there's
an
indemnity
against
the
lien,
it
isn't
going
to
do
any
harm
maybe
if
we
say
that
the
lien
arose.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
yes,
sir?
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
in
his
dissent
in
the
second
grillea?
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
don't
remember.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
on
the
indemnity
feature.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
i
don't
see
why
a
one
man's
--
why
a
man's
property
may
not
be
taken.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
grillea
is
--
has
certainly
led
to
a
great
deal
of
confusion
and
i
think
comment
in
the
--
in
the
district
courts,
my
brother
has
referred
to,
he
ha
--
he
has
said
that
there
are
three
cases
which
uphold
the
in
rem
liability
in
this
situation.
and
of
course
grillea,
the
second
grillea
is
one
of
them.
the
other
two
are
district
court
cases.
one
by
judge
dimock
in
the
southern
district,
i
think,
of
new
york,
in
leotta
against
the
esparta
and
the
other
one
is
reed
against
the
yaka
in
the
third
circuit
and
that
was
a
district
court
decision
which
is
on
appeal
now,
was
argued
there,
i
think,
on
the
18th
of
last
december.
judge
--
the
leotta
against
the
esparta
in
new
york
went
off
on
exceptions
to
the
libel
and
while
judge
bondy's
much
earlier
decision
in
vitozi
against
platano
which
was
the
in
rem
in
aspect
of
vitozi
against
balboa
shipping
company.
the
judge
in
--
in
that
case
seem
to
feel
that
because
there
was
a
shipowner
who
owned
the
ship
but
who
was
not
protected
by
a
compensation
act
perhaps
that
was
an
adequate
reason
for
holding
the
ship
in
rem,
and
the
same
thing
is
said
in
the
pennsylvania
case,
reed
against
yaka,
in
other
words,
that
although
the
owner
admittedly
is
not
liable
in
personam,
the
fact
that
he
is
at
sometime
when
going
to
the
ship
back
takes
the
stand
out
of
awarding
a
decree
or
a
judgment
which
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
compensation
act
has
said
exceeds
what
the
congress
has
said
should
occur
in
that
type
of
case.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
yes,
sir.
he
does
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
it's
the
very
question
of
in
rem
responsibility.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
cases
in
that
category
dealing
with
longshoremen
in
courts
of
appeals,
i
think
that
this
and
grillea
are
the
only
two.
i
know
of
no
others.
i
--
on
this
question
of
--
of
personification
and
how
far
on
this
question
of
personification
--
personification
theory
and
how
far
it
is
to
be
carried,
i
think
i
could
comment
that
mr.
justice
holmes
was
one
of
the
writers
on
the
subject
back
in
his
work
on
the
common
law
in
1881
and
he
talked
about
the
english
view
and
pointed
out
that
personification
was
carried
further
in
the
united
states
than
in
england
and
he
thought
that
because
of
the
convenience
security
which
the
ship
offered
to
an
injured
party
whether
contract
or
tort
that
that
might
have
been
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
continued
veracity
of
the
personification
theory
although
it
apparently
arose
out
of
the
ancient
law
of
(inaudible)
and
conceptions
of
a
--
animistic
conceptions.
but
when
mr.
justice
holmes
came
to
decide
cases
in
this
court
where
the
personification
theory
led
to
inconsistent
or
illogical
results,
he
had
no
hesitation
in
leaving
it
behind
as
a
fiction
as
he
did
both
in
the
eugene
f.
moran
and
the
western
maid
which
is
cited
on
page
12
of
our
brief.
now,
the
western
maid
is
--
it
seems
to
me,
of
real
importance
here
because
in
that
case,
two
vessels
privately
owned
were
demised
to
the
united
states
during
world
war
i
and
were
used
as
public
vessels.
there
was
no
public
vessels
act
in
those
days.
the
shipping
act
1916
which
later
became
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
didn't
cover
the
situation
so
that
unless
the
owner
of
--
those
vessels
by
the
way
were
in
collision
while
they
were
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states.
now,
when
--
those
vessels
were
returned
to
their
owners
the
end
of
the
war
and
they
were
liable
in
rem.
and
this
court
said
in
the
western
maid,
mr.
justice
holmes
speaking
for
the
majority
said
that
in
a
legal
sense
no
tort
had
been
committed
by
the
vessels
because
at
the
time
the
act
was
done,
there
was
no
means
of
recovery
and
that
when
the
vessels
passed
back
to
their
owners
even
though
on
a
theory
of
personification,
you
could
follow
the
reeds
that
this
court
wouldn't
permit
that
to
be
done.
and
we
think
that
the
analogy
here
is
very
plain
that
the
quasi-immunity
or
quasi
--
or
the
quasi-immunity
or
satisfaction
of
a
liability
of
bordas
&
company,
the
charterer
attached
to
the
vessels
so
that
when
it
--
when
it
gets
beyond
that
state,
it
is
no
longer
subject
to
a
maritime
lien
or
to
put
it
in
a
different
way,
my
brother
says
why
should
this
situation
of
demise
cut
off
the
lien.
and
we
put
it
--
and
view
it
the
other
way
around,
did
a
lien
ever
arise
in
this
situation
because
of
the
compact
and
the
demise.
now
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
yes,
sir.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
by
this
court?
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
yes
sir.
it
did.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
well,
it
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
yes.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
well,
that
the
lien
on
the
vessel
did
not
exist.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
yes,
sir.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
well
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
i
don't
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
--
know
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
yes,
sir.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
what
was
the
first
of
that,
your
honor?
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
well
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
no.
i
don't
think
that
that
has
any
relevance
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
has
relevance
here
is
that
the
--
in
the
western
maid,
the
sovereign
immunity
followed
the
vessel
back
into
the
hands
of
the
private
owner.
and
here,
the
quasi-immunity
of
the
demisee
protected
by
the
compensation
act
should
follow
as
to
his
liability
and
his
stake
in
the
vessel.
and
the
general
owner
had
no
liability
at
all.
now
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
that's
right.
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
did
you
ask
--
mr.
seymour
p.
edgerton
i
know
of
no
other
cases
mr.
justice
frankfurter
involving
collisions
in
which
the
western
maid
arguments
have
been
followed
or
discussed
at
any
great
length
but
this
continental
grain
company
against
the
barge
fbl-585
in
which
the
question
of
transferability
of
causes
of
action
under
1404,
i
think
it
is,
of
the
judicial
code
was
discussed.
the
majority
there
in
mr.
justice
black's
opinion,
i
think
was,
discussed
the
personality
theory
and
how
far
it
should
go
and
also
the
city
of
norwich
and
the
consumers
import
company
against
the
kkkz
and
those
last
two
cases
are
cases
where
the
limitation
of
liability
acts
of
united
states
provided
that
under
certain
circumstances
the
owner
should
not
be
liable
in
the
kk
--
consumers
against
the
kkk,
it
was
the
'fire
statute'
which
said
that
if
cargo
was
damaged
by
fire,
the
owner
shall
not
be
liable
unless
he
was
negligent
or
procured
the
fire,
the
other
was
the
usual
limitation
section
where
the
owner's
interest
--
owner's
--
what
can
be
taken
from
the
owner
shall
not
exceed
the
value
of
the
owner's
interest
in
the
vessel.
and
both
of
those
cases
that
was
asserted
that
that
meant
that
the
owner
shouldn't
be
liable
but
should
--
could
still
go
against
the
ship
and
this
court
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
at
all.
now,
i
want
very
briefly
to
mention
to
the
last
point
in
our
brief
which
is
the
question
which
is
presented
if
this
court
finds
that
there
is
in
rem
liability
in
this
case.
now,
this
question
is
not
before
you
on
the
record.
it
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals.
you
will
note
from
judge
aldrich's
opinion
that
because
of
the
way
they
decided
the
case
they
didn't
find
it
necessarily
to
reach
this
point
but
it
remains
in
the
case
and
that
is
this
that
--
when
--
that
this
carried
--
the
vessel
here
was
actually
seized
by
the
marshal.
it
was
a
case
where
he
actually
went
aboard
onto
the
process
that
was
on
the
december
the
8th
i
think,
and
a
couple
of
weeks
later,
the
claimant
--
the
respondent
pichirilo
filed
a
claim
of
the
vessel
in
the
form
of
a
motion.
and
with
that
--
and
that
motion
was
ascended
to.
and
in
that
motion,
he
asked
to
put
up
a
bond
for
$20,000
for
the
release
of
the
vessel
that
was
presented
to
and
the
bond
was
filed.
now,
we
think
or
--
the
district
judge
found
against
the
libellant
for
$30,000
and
his
decree
read
against
both
the
ship
and
the
respond
--
the
personal
respondent
in
the
same
amount.
i
just
want
you
to
read
j.k.
welding
against
gotham
marine
which
is
cited
here.
we
think
that
any
decree
against
the
ship
cannot
exceed
the
amount
of
the
bond
even
though
there's
a
supersedeas
bond
--
