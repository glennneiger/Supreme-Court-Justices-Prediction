mr.
charles
r.
iden
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
been
quite
interesting
to
me
to
see
that
oliver
case
kicked
around
that
i
don't
feel
too
good
about
it.
the
last
time
i
saw
mr.
previant,
he
and
i
were
here
and
we
argued
that
to
the
court
and
i
was
on
the
wrong
end
of
the
decision.
the
question
was
asked
whether
or
not,
in
that
case
they
were
found
to
be
employees
in
the
lower
courts.
in
my
efforts
to
prepare
that
case,
and
if
this
is
interesting
from
this
point
of
view
that
we
felt
that
the
oliver
was
an
independent
contractor
and
the
ohio
courts
so
found
that
either
i
feel
that
when
this
court
reversed
the
ohio
courts
that
they
must
have
found
oliver
to
have
been
an
employee
or
the
union
wouldn't
have
had
the
right
to
bargain
for
him
under
the
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i'm
doing
best
to
forget
that
case.
(attempt
to
laughter)
it's
a
3rd
law
edition.
i
couldn't
cite
it
in
the
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
oh,
i
never
confess
error.
(attempt
to
laughter)
the
interesting
part
is
--
was,
in
that
case,
i
felt
that
he
was
independent
contractor
and
i
feel
this
court
said
he
was
an
employee.
now
here,
i
feel
that
these
boys
are
employees
and
if
we
lose,
you're
going
to
have
to
find
they
are
independent
contractors,
so
much
for
oliver.
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan
had
some
question
to
mr.
ginnane.
what
he
would
suggest
this
court
could
do
about
fixing
a
rule
for
this,
i
think
that
i
would
go
further
than
mr.
ginnane
would
and
i
will
approach
it
this
way.
i
like
to
feel
that
sometimes
you
could
answer
these
questions
a
little
better
if
you
get
away
from
washington
and
get
out
where
these
things
are
occurring.
i
am
from
akron,
ohio
and
we
have
a
few
trucking
companies
around
there
and
we
have
a
few
truckers.
and
i
have
many
people
come
in
to
me
and
that's
why
and
i'm
here.
i'm
just
an
intervener.
people
come
in
to
me
and
they
have
problems
with
these
carriers
so
how
can
we
haul
our
own
goods.
and
i
want
to
answer
the
question
--
your
question
the
way
i
advise
my
clients
and
i
think
it's
stronger
that
mr.
ginnane
put
it.
i
tell
them,
“you
can
rent
trucks
just
as
you
would
rent
them
if
you
want
to
hearst,
as
he
put
it.”
now
how
does
hearst
rent
their
trucks?
they
will
rent
them
by
the
mile.
they
don't
rent
them
by
the
amount
of
goods
that's
transported.
they
rent
them
by
the
mile
and
hearst
will
furnish
insurance.
it's
common.
if
you
rent
a
car,
when
you
drive
it,
the
hearst,
they
furnish
the
insurance,
they
furnish
the
car,
they
furnish
the
gas
and
oil
and
they
repair
the
car.
they
will
tell
you,
“now,
we
buy
a
$100
deductible
insurance
and
if
you
don't
want
to
pay
that
minimum
of
a
$100,
you
pay
us
the
next
$3
a
day
or
some
extra
premiums
if
you
want
more
coverage”
and
i
think
that's
the
key
to
the
leasing
of
the
equipment.
it
can
have
no
basis
whatsoever
to
the
amount
that's
greatly
transported.
does
hearst
care
how
many
people
you
put
in
the
automobile
when
they
rent
it
to
you?
of
course,
they
don't,
so
long
as
you
don't
put
them
on
the
roof.
that's
the
key
to
the
running
of
the
equipment.
now,
i
will
say
to
this
court
that
that's
not
what
clients
like
to
hear.
they
want
to
find
a
device
so
that
they
can
measure
the
rental
of
that
equipment
by
the
amount
of
crate
that's
carried.
that
is
wrong
and
i
tell
them
further,
“who's
going
to
drive
that
truck?”
that
employee
and
this
is
where
i
go
further
than
mr.
ginnane,
that
driver
of
that
truck
must
be
your
employee
and
he
must
be
employed
by
you
just
the
same
as
every
janitor,
every
production
man,
and
every
office
man
in
your
company.
if
you
pay
profit
sharing,
he
gets
profit
sharing.
if
he
--
if
your
people
get
vacations
that
truck
driver
gets
vacations,
you
must
pay
social
security,
workmen's
compensation.
and
every
benefit,
every
fringe
benefit
and
everything
else
that
you
do
in
hiring
employees,
you
must
do
for
that
employee.
if
you
require
all
your
employees
to
have
their
picture
taken
and
have
it
put
in
the
employee's
record,
you
also
must
do
that.
now
that's
where
i
go
farther
--
further
than
mr.
ginnane.
now
that's
the
difference
between
these
cases
that
they
have
discussed
in
our
case.
this
case
is
unique.
and
as
you
read
this
lower
court
cases
on
this
problem,
you
will
find
that
to
be
true.
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
you
will
find
something
lacking,
because
they
are
trying
to
measure
the
amount
of
--
the
amount
they
pay
upon
the
amount
crate
transported
or
they're
trying
to
avoid
the
benefit
--
the
detriments
of
certain
back
haul
problems.
you
will
find
in
most
of
those
cases
that
the
shipper,
the
manufacturer,
the
private
carrier
manufactures
the
product
that
he
wants
to
move
one
way.
he
has
nothing
coming
back.
and
in
order
to
make
private
carriage
work,
just
as
you
must
--
it's
true
of
common
carriage
or
contract
carriage,
you
have
to
put
freight
on
that
truck
both
ways.
and
so
that
they
enter
into
devices
in
order
to
avoid
the
problem
of
driving
that
--
moving
that
truck
empty
one
way,
and
that
was
again
the
trouble
and
i
will
agree
with
this
court,
i
will
agree
with
mr.
ginnane,
that's
wrong.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i'm
just
an
intervener.
(attempt
to
laughter)
you
asked
the
question
if
mr.
--
i
say
that
i'm
going
to
contrast
what
i'm
talking
about
with
this
case
here.
that
did
not
occur
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
certainly
not.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
this
case
is
unique.
i
think
in
order
to
understand
this
case
you
must
understand
the
problem
that
the
commission
was
faced
with
in
the
normal
case.
and
the
method
that
the
subterfuge
in
every
one
of
these
cases
and
i
haven't
bore
you
with
all
of
them,
but
in
the
lamb
case.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
certainly.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
absolutely.
they
rent
this
--
the
--
my
case
isn't
identical.
the
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
no,
mine
is
weather-seal
from
one
of
the
manufacturers
from
ohio
and
ours
is
very
similar.
they
lease
this
truck.
they
lease
--
it's
not
a
trip
lease.
oklahoma
takes
the
risk
of
whether
or
not
they're
going
to
put
anything
into
that
truck
coming
back.
if
they
got
some
raw
materials
at
the
other
end
that
they
own,
they
bring
it
back.
you
will
find
in
these
cases
that
they're
referring
to
the
lamb
case,
the
allen
case,
the
lamb
and
poynor,
259
f.2d
is
in
my
brief,
i
don't
think.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
if
they
--
if
they
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
well
certainly.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
that's
right
if
it's
not
their
primary
business.
one
way
they
try
to
get
around
this
thing
is
they'll
bring
back
exempt
commodities
and
this
agricultural
exemption
causes
an
awful
lot
of
problems,
but
you
can't
solve
it,
congress
took
care
of
that.
they
will
have
to
take
care
of
that.
but
they'll
bring
farm
products
back
and
they'll
bill
in
order
to
make
it
appear
that
the
private
carrier
is
using
that
truck
both
ways
they
will
fictitiously
make
it
appear
that
the
shipper
is
buying
this
wheat
and
the
oranges
and
these
farm
products
and
then
selling
them,
of
course,
as
a
subterfuge.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
well,
a
private
carrier
under
the
definition
by
congress
is
a
manufacturer,
a
person
engaged
in
a
primary
business.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
oh!
certainly.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
he's
an
independent
contractor.
he's
an
--
you're
doing
it
independent
business.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i
would
say
that
it
is
because
if
this
–-
mr.
charles
r.
iden
well,
the
contract
carrier
must
have
the
authority
to
haul
for
everyone
that
he's
hauling
for
if
he
could
make
a
contract
but
the
company
that
has
crate
moving
both
directions,
he
can
do
it.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
oh,
certainly
but
if
he
is
--
if
his
shipper
only
has
crate
moving
one
way
then
he's
got
a
dead
head
himself.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
yeah,
the
contract
carrier
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
oh,
certainly,
he
might
have
half
a
dozen
contracts
that
he
might
--
depending
on
the
breadth
of
his
authority.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
that's
correct.
like
i
say
that
in
those
situations,
these
fellows
are
violating
the
law
and
he's
wrong
because
the
act
says
that
if
a
private
carrier
is
one
who
is
controlling
hauling
goods
which
is
his
primary
business,
and
if
general
motors
started
hauling
oranges
back
from
florida
in
order
to
put
it
in
the
supermarket,
that's
not
their
primary
business.
i
presume
that
they
could
bring
some
oranges
back
to
serve
in
their
cafeteria
and
they
own
the
oranges,
it
was
legitimate,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
this
got
to
be
their
business,
so
that's
the
dividing
line
here.
oklahoma
furniture
leases
this
truck,
they
pay
a
mileage
rental,
they
pay
that
mileage
whether
they
had
any
furniture
entered
or
not.
now
would
you
get
into
the
discussion
of
the
cost
of
transportation
is
a
little
word
of
art
here.
a
manufacturer,
when
he's
talking
about
cost
of
transportation,
he's
not
talking
about
how
much
it
cost
to
drive
a
truck
per
mile,
he's
talking
how
much
the
cost
made
per
unit
of
the
item
i'm
going
to
sell.
and
in
this
case,
when
oklahoma
furniture
pay
so
much
a
mile
for
the
lease
of
that
truck,
they
don't
know
when
they
send
that
out
and
they
take
this
risk
whether
they're
going
to
have
that
truck
one-fourth
full,
clear
full,
or
whether
when
it
returns,
they're
going
to
have
any
freight
entered
at
all.
so
that
depending
upon
how
much
furniture
they
can
have
outbound
and
whether
or
not
they
had
any
return
of
raw
materials
determines
their
cost
of
transportation
so
they
are
taking
the
risk.
and
it's
just
as
common
as
the
sun
coming
up
in
the
morning,
the
manufacturer
paid
employees
by
the
unit
of
work
just
performed,
so
that
the
payment
of
a
driver
by
the
number
of
miles
he
drives
is
just
as
--
it
should
be
so
common,
it's
beyond
any
argument.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i
say
that
--
i
think
that
the
agricultural
exemption
is
probably
caused
one
of
the
problems
here
because
you
don't
have
to
have
any
authority
at
all
to
handle
agricultural
commodities.
so
these
fellows
who
will
had
it
--
there's
a
unbalance
of
regulated
transportation
into
some
of
these
agricultural
areas
that
the
--
so
long
as
florida's
principal
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
agricultural
commodities
are
certainly
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
so
that
you
find
what
causes
this,
not
at
our
case,
but
the
evil
that
they're
talking
about
is
that
so
much
of
the
freight
moving
out
of
florida
is
unregulated
and
most
of
the
freight
moving
in
is
regulated
so
there's
a
terrible
temptation
for
these
people
to
fix
up
fictitious
deals
to
trip
lease;
they'll
come
out
unregulated
from
florida
then
they'll
--
they
will
--
what
i
say
is
evil
then,
they
will
lease
the
truck
to
haul
a
material
which
should
be
regulated
and
then
they'll
lease
it
--
the
driver
for
one
trip,
and
i
say
that
it's
wrong,
i
say
it's
not
a
bona
fide
deal
where
an
employer
hires
an
employee
or
truck
driver
for
one
trip.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
no.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
that's
right.
i
only
point
that
out
so
that
this
court
will
understand
what
the
difference
between
our
cases.
this
is
unique.
this
is
the
first
time
that
a
case
has
come
up
where
the
commission
says,
“the
employment
contract
is
lawful.
we
can't
quarrel
with
it.”
they
have
said,
“your
release
is
proper”
and
they
have
found
no
subterfuge
and
so
in
desperation,
they
have
said,
“whenever
in
this
case,
the
lessor
is
hired
to
drive
the
truck,
we're
going
to
find
that
is
irrebuttable
presumption
that
that
is
wrong.”
mr.
charles
r.
iden
that
is
the
--
nothing
is
--
even
mr.
ginnane
said
that
he
would
agree
that
has
been
no
subterfuge
here.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
your
honor,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
the
situation
though
is
that
when
lawyer
set
this
up,
they
make
a
paper
deal.
they
will
make
that
--
they
will
hire
the
fellow
for
the
one
way
trip,
and
they
will
lease
it
for
the
one
or
two
way
trip
and
they
release
it
at
the
end
of
the
trip,
and
then
they'll
take
the
trip
--
truck
over
and
they'll
(inaudible)
--
they
can
new
lease
going
back
and
they
will
take
the
same
driver
and
they
have
the
new
employment
with
that
driver
--
that
his
employment
shifts
throughout.
i
think
that
that's
wrong.
maybe
i
shouldn't
go
that
far.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i'd
like
to
read
something.
private
carriers,
of
course,
need
not
own
their
vehicles
outright.
they
may
lease
them
from
their
owners.
moreover,
they
may
employ
the
owners
to
drive
such
leased
vehicles
without
necessarily
converting
the
operation
into
a
contract
carriage
operation.
that
sounds
like
something
from
my
brief
but
that's
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
brief.
and
in
answer
to
some
of
the
questions
here,
mr.
ginnane
says
that
the
real
issue
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
where
you
lease,
where
you
hire
the
lessor
of
a
truck
to
drive
it,
that
is
the
evil
because
they
said
if
you
lease
a
truck
from
hearst
and
pay
a
mileage
rate
and
then
you
hire
another
driver,
hire
a
driver
at
a
mileage
rate,
they
say
that's
alright.
so
that
it
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i
felt
that
he
--
i
felt
that
he
had
narrowed
it
down
to
that
issue.
now
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
he
ignores
--
they
ignored
the
fact
that
in
this
case
the
--
and
the
risk
is
not
transferred.
the
lessor
of
that
equipment
is
getting
a
--
well,
that's
the
reason
i
went
into
these
other
cases.
where
they
work
--
the
lease
is
based
among
the
amount
of
freight
that's
going
to
be
moved
in
that
truck
by
one
device
or
another
then
the
risk
is
transferred
to
the
lessor
but
where
the
shipper,
the
private
carrier
pays
for
the
use
of
that
truck,
whether
monthly,
or
weekly
or
a
mileage
basis
irregardless
of
the
amount
of
goods
they
ship
to
that
truck
then
the
risk
has
not
been
transferred
because
the
shipper,
the
private
carrier
oklahoma
here
has
assumed
the
risk
of
how
much
business
he
is
going
to
have,
how
much
freight
he's
going
to
be
able
to
get
on
to
this
truck,
how
much
he's
going
to
return
on
that
truck.
and
the
cost
of
shipping
his
goods
has
gone
up
very
tremendously
as
to
whether
or
not
he
has
a
thousand
pounds
on
the
truck
or
whether
he
has
10,000
pounds
in
the
truck
or
whether
or
not
he
can
bring
backs
some
goods
on
the
return
trip.
one
of
the
problems
here
that
i
see
was
--
i
think
the
motive
in
this
case
is
--
i
can't
agree
with
it.
they
take
the
position
that
there
has
been
a
--
the
evil
here
is
the
divergence
of
freight
from
a
common
or
contract
carrier
to
a
private
carrier
and
i
think
that
must
assume
that
these
carriers
have
a
vested
right
to
a
certain
amount
of
freight.
i
don't
think
that's
true.
i
think
the
issue
here
is
to
whether
or
not
these
people
are
violating
the
law
and
not
the
fact
that
the
freight
is
moving
from
carrier
from
common
and
contract
carriers
or
private
because
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
private
carriers
are
recognized
by
the
congress
as
regulated
carriers.
and
in
the
--
and
in
the
preamble
to
the
act,
congress
has
said,
it
is
hereby
declared
to
be
the
national
transportation
policy
of
the
congress
to
provide
for
fair
and
impartial
regulation
of
all
modes
of
transportation
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
act.
so
administered
as
to
recognize
and
preserve
the
inherent
advantage
of
each.
now,
bearing
in
mind
that
in
the
act
there
are
common
carriers,
there
are
contract
carriers,
there
are
private
carriers.
and
so
i
feel
that
the
commission
of
all
parties
of
this
case
should
be
asking
for
a
fair
administration
of
the
act.
it
should
not
be
taking
the
position.
there's
been
a
divergence
of
freight
to
get
in
to
that
question
and
where
--
we
get
far
afield.
that
was
the
cry
of
the
railroads
in
the
1930s
when
the
trucks
started.
the
truckers
were
able
to
give
a
more
vigorous
attention
to
business
and
that's
how
they
grew.
and
if
you
want
to
know
the
basic
fact
of
why
transport
--
moving
the
freight
is
being
diverted
if
you
want
to
use
the
word
common
and
contract
carrier
or
private
carriers
because
the
common
and
contract
carriers
are
now
reaching
the
point
that
the
railroads
were
in
the
1930s
and
they're
not
as
free
to
make
--
give
the
service
that
the
public
needs.
and
when
the
con
--
when
the
common
carriers
are
able
to
give
service,
they're
going
to
get
the
freight
back
and
they
can't
get
the
freight
--
i
don't
think
they
should
be
getting
the
freight
back
to
--
by
appealing
to
this
court
to
assist
them
in
making
it
difficult
for
a
private
industry
to
transport
their
own
commodity.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
they
changed
their
method
in
conducting
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
--
that
i
consider
a
lawful
business.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
that's
why
we're
here.
there's
no
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
absolutely
correct.
i
think
--
well,
the
problem
is
here
and
our
arguing
this
is
we
are
conferred
with
the
best
brief
that
we
could
write
probably
written
and
more
stronger
--
in
stronger
terms
that
we
could
--
would
write
one
and
that
is
the
dissenting
opinion
of
commissioner
webb
from
the
commission.
i
wouldn't
--
i
don't
think
i
would've
had
the
nerve,
let's
put
it
that
way
to
write
a
strong,
a
brief
as
he
did.
and
if
you
will
read
--
and
if
you'll
read
that,
he
sat
with
the
commission.
i
think
he
knew
it
was
on
their
minds
and
that
he
is
the
one
that
pointed
out
that
the
only
thing
that
the
commission
could
find
wrong
was
the
fact
that
the
lessor
was
hired
to
drive
the
equipment.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
let
me
read
this,
your
honor.
concededly,
without
arrangements,
with
respect
to
the
common
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
opinion.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
at
page
160.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
160
of
the
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
the
record.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
concededly,
without
arrangements
with
respect
to
the
complimentary
services
neither
the
driver
nor
equipment
services
of
the
owner-operators
standing
alone
could
be
found
to
be
those
of
carriers'
for-hire.
i
think
they
base
their
decision
on
that
concession.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
(inaudible)
the
point.
i
feel
that
the
commission
has
boiled
this
down
to
this
issue
and
i
think
that
that's
the
evil.
i
say
that
one
--
that's
the
reason
i
am
here
because
the
district
--
the
local
supervisor
told
--
we
have
a
similar
situation.
the
local
supervisor
says
in
reliance
upon
this
decision
before
it
was
appealed
in
oklahoma
that
we
were
wrong
because
the
lessor
was
driving
the
truck.
he
says
that's
it.
that's
what
this
case
holds.
and
i
said,
well,
i
made
peace
with
them
by
saying
i'll
enter
that
case
and
if
the
government
wins,
we'll
quit
and
if
i
can
change
that
decision,
then
he's
to
agree
that
we're
right.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i
think
i
would
review
my
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
--
arrangements
of
the
--
in
light
of
the
decisions
that
would
come
out
and
i
would
still
try
to
have
my
party
obeying
the
law.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
this
question
was
asked
concerning
the
leasing
regulations
for
those
who
were
approved
by
this
court
in
mc-43
american
trucking
association
case.
this
question
was
asked
as
to
whether
those
regulations
applied
to
private
carriers
and
the
answer
was
no
because
those
regulations
do
apply
only
to
common
contract
carriers.
we
say
that
the
oklahoma
furniture
arrangement
comes
within
the
answer
given
by
the
commission
that
the
leased
vehicle
has
been
transferred
to
the
shipper's
possession
and
it
is
operated
under
the
shipper's
complete
direction
and
control.
i
think
that
there's
no
--
i
don't
think
that
the
commission
argued
that
point
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
he's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i
have
failed
to
see
it.
i
think
that
we
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
that's
right.
i
think
we
--
i
think
we're
complying
with
what
the
commission
has
said
we
had
to
do.
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
when
the
commission
--
their
opinion
said
that
the
lessors
guaranteed
a
fixed
indefinite
cost
for
transportation,
i
think
that
that
finding
was
in
error.
i
think
that
it
was
not
based
upon
the
record
as
a
whole
and
i
think
that
the
district
court
wisely
and
properly
reversed
them
on
that
because
--
and
we're
belaboring
the
subject
on
that
point
again
because,
as
i
say,
that
we
have
not
illegally
transferred
the
risks.
i
think
that
as
mr.
ginnane
said,
we
have
our
right
to
lease
trucks.
we
don't
have
to
invest
our
money
in
trucks.
but
understanding
the
way
that
these
things
can
--
you
can
buy
trucks
and
you
can
pay
very
little
down
and
you
make
payments
over
four
or
five
years.
you
can
--
as
far
as
a
private
carrier
is
concerned,
he
doesn't
have
to
lease
them
if
he's
only
interested
in
avoiding
the
outlay
of
money,
that's
begging
the
issue.
i
say
to
this
court
that
the
private
carrier
has
a
right
to
lease
trucks,
then
there's
nothing
wrong
with
this
lease,
that
if
this
lease
in
any
way
reflected
the
amount
of
goods
that
this
shipper
was
going
to
put
on
then
i
say
that
its
subterfuge.
it's
wrong.
it's
a
violation
of
law.
and
i'd
say
that
these
people
that
were
hired
were
not
lawfully
and
properly
hired
and
that's
wrong.
and
i
certainly
think
the
fact
that
these
people
were
covered
by
union
contract
and
there's
no
evidence
that
that
wasn't
a
good
faith
labor
contract,
this
union
represents
everybody
that
works
there.
if
there's
ever
been
a
fact
that
bolstered
up
the
situation
that
it's
lawful,
that
is
it.
i'd
better
send
the
union
not
to
organize
weather-seal.
we
don't
have
that
situation
there.
we
just
hired
them
and
we're
just
paying
them,
but
i
don't
think
that
you
can
take
the
issue
with
the
fact
that
these
people
are
properly
and
lawfully
hired
and
directed
how
to
do
their
work.
the
trucks
are
used
for
nothing
other
than
the
transportation
of
oklahoma
furniture
is
proper.
there's
no
dispute,
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
that.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
they
own
the
trailers.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
yes,
not
the
power.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
the
contract
carriers
may
make
that
kind
of
contract.
that
their
ordinary
contract
is
made
on
the
basis
of
how
much
goods
they
transport
and
the
contract
carrier
is
generally
--
let's
say
this,
almost,
i
would
say
100%,
i
think,
an
independent
contractor,
he
is
the
one
that
carries
the
public
liability
insurance.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
contract
carrier
is
an
independent
contractor.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
well
the
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i
can
answer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
the
contract
--
the
contract
carrier
is
--
is
a
contract,
the
transportation
of
goods.
so
there's
no
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i
was
going
to
keep
--
but
make
it
very
simple
--
keep
away
from
these
--
very
simply
the
contract
that
a
shipper
makes
with
a
contract
carrier
is
a
contract
for
the
shipment
of
goods.
there
is
no
such
contract
here.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
that
is
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
that's
right.
now
that
--
i'm
not
saying
that
a
contract
carrier
cannot
make
a
contract
with
a
mileage
basis,
but
that
is
not
the
normal,
that's
purely
a
special
situation.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
that
is
truly
done
with
a
specialized
deal
if
you're
hauling
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
it's
legal.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
the
only
way
i
can
show
that
--
to
tell
the
difference
is
to
show
the
different
ingredients
in
the
contract.
the
contract
carrier
will
always
be
responsible
to
the
public.
in
this
case,
oklahoma
furniture
is
responsible
for
the
--
to
the
public.
in
the
contract
carrier
case,
the
contract
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
oklahoma
is
responsible
to
the
public.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
the
truck
has
a
collision;
they're
the
ones
that
are
responsible.
the
contract
carrier
is
always
responsible
in
the
other
situation.
it's
a
question
of
responsibility.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
apparently,
the
arrangement
that
oklahoma
had
prior
to
the
present
arrangement,
arkansas
held
to
be
illegal.
this
present
arrangement
as
i
understand
it
has
never
been
reviewed
with
the
arkansas
courts
and
i
am
not
from
arkansas.
i
have
no
opinion
of
what
the
law
of
arkansas
is.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
yes,
i
would.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
--
you
said
lessor.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
your
honor
said
lessor.
now,
i
would
say
this
in
every
state
in
the
union
that
if
i'm
driving
a
truck,
i
--
and
i
have
an
accident,
i
am
primarily
responsible.
my
employer
is
always
secondarily
responsible.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
well,
i
can
imagine
that
a
normal
furniture
truck
would
be
treated
as
a
dangerous
instrumentality
as
you're
viewing
it.
i
--
i
could
imagine
that
if
we
were
--
if
we
were
moving
an
outsized
type
of
equipment
that
its
--
you're
the
type
--
that
you'd
have
to
have
a
permit
from
the
state
to
move
it
even
on
a
highway,
an
illegal
load
that
you're
going
to
permit
that
had
outriggers
on
it
using
up
the
whole
highway
and
that
exceeded
the
capacity
of
the
truck,
i
would
say
that
possibly
like
a
landlord
who
doesn't
have
his
--
the
balustrades
properly
built,
the
lessor
might
be
liable.
your
question
was,
did
i
feel
that
this
lessor
under
this
situation,
then
i
certainly
would
deny
it.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
well,
your
honor
asked
the
question
could
they
and
i
suppose
they
could
but
i
don't
think
they
would.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
well
i
--
i
would
say
--
i
think
we've
long
passed
the
era
when
a
court
would
say
that
the
operation
of
a
normal
automobile
or
normal
freight
vehicle
would
be
a
dangerous
instrumentality.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
yes.
and
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
--
that
the
lessor
--
not
as
lessor
but
as
the
driver.
and
bear
in
mind
that
when
this
truck
--
this
company,
we've
talked
about
what
the
powers
are
--
here
are,
this
oklahoma
furniture
has
the
power
to
tell
this
driver
to
drive
anybody
else's
truck
and
as
commissioner
webb
points
out
as
he
views
the
decision
of
the
commission,
if
i
drove
your
truck
and
your
honor
drove
my
truck,
that's
lawful.
it's
only
when
you
drive
your
truck
and
i
drive
mine
is
illegal,
and
i
--
if
that's
the
decision,
i
think
it's
a
terrible
one
because
you
have
to
view
--
we
are
trying
as
judges
and
lawyers
to
make
law
that
truck
drivers
are
all
vague.
and
when
you
--
when
we
create
law
that
says
to
joe,
you
can't
drive
your
truck
but
you
can
drive
pete
and
pete
can
drive
yours,
you're
going
to
bring
on
disrespect
for
the
law,
webb
is
right.
i
think
that's
a
terrible
result.
we
had
a
similar
situation
in
ohio,
and
our
public
utility
laws
are
very
similar
to
the
icc,
the
interstate
--
the
congress
copied
their
laws
considerably
from
the
states
and
states
were
in
effect
and
before
in
our
ohio
law
was
passed
around
1925
and
the
icc
in
1935.
and
our
commission,
i
think
all
commissions
are
jealous
of
their
prerogatives
and
their
authorities
and
they
have
generally
followed
the
same
rules
and
that
the
lessors
couldn't
be
drivers.
and
that
situation
came
up
in
ohio,
that
there,
neither
case
reported
165
ohio
state
391
discussed
by
me
in
my
brief
that
commenced
at
page
14.
and
that
was
appealed
to
the
courts
and
the
court
did
exactly
the
same
thing
as
the
district
court
did
in
this
case.
and
in
commenting
on
where
the
hiring
and
the
trucking
comes
together,
the
truck
--
the
court
said,
where
however
a
driver
is
also
furnished,
then
they
maybe
an
engaging
in
such
business.
now,
the
difference
between
our
court
and
the
commission,
the
icc
here,
they
recognize
that
there
is
a
situation,
where
you
must
look
at
it.
but
they
went
on
to
say,
however,
whether
there
is,
will
depend
in
a
particular
instance
upon
the
relationship
between
the
driver
of
the
truck
and
the
one
to
whom
the
truck
and
driver
are
furnished.
so
the
court
went
on,
examined
this
situation
and
found
that
in
that
case,
that
the
law
that
the
driver
made
a
legitimate
lease
of
his
truck,
and
that
he
was
legitimately
hired
and
he
was
told
where
and
how
to
do
various
things.
and
so,
they
found
in
that
case
that
where
the
control
was
properly
in
the
lessee.
if
they'd
overcome
this
presumption
that
might
arise,
where
you
see
that
the
truck
and
the
driver
converging.
and
i
say
that's
the
rule
here
that
must
be
made.
i
would
say
that
it
just
as
possible
to
have
lack
of
control
where
they
leased
the
hearst
truck
and
driving
outside.
i
can
imagine
that
in
a
desire
to
obtain
efficiency,
that
they
could
say
to
this
driver
who
can
make
up
many
arrangements,
i
represent
a
profit
sharing
company
where
they
get
a
lot
of
efficiency
in
their
plan
by
sharing
percentage
of
the
profits
with
their
employees
that
you
could
go
to
your
driver
and
i'll
say
we
own
or
we
lease
this
truck.
now,
we're
willing
to
--
so
that
you
can
make
some
--
more
money
than
just
a
truck
driver,
we
will
credit
to
this
truck
the
amount
of
money
that
we
would
spend
if
we
ship
by
common
carrier
and
then
we
will
charge
the
lease
or
the
depreciation
on
the
truck.
we
will
charge
your
basic
salary
and
we
will
charge
all
of
the
expenses
of
operating
the
truck,
gas
or
everything
else.
and
at
the
end
of
the
period
of
time,
you
will
see
if
we
saved
any
money
on
this
and
we'll
give
you
part
of
it.
i
think
that
it
should
be
--
actually,
you
could
come
up
with
an
arrangement
that
would
be
further
a
field
from
control
that
we
have
in
this
case.
so
the
minds
amend
and
make
up
many
arrangements
and
if
we
sit
down
and
nit-pick
an
arrangement,
you
could
probably
find
something
wrong
with
many
of
them.
i
say
it
in
a
broad
outline
and
i
think
the
commission
did
find
that
the
oklahoma
furniture
properly
controlled
this
operation
and
that
the
lease
was
proper.
you
say
that
mr.
ginnane
said
that
--
well,
there's
no
minimum.
but
now
the
--
which
as
you
filed
applications
for
contracts
in
the
public
utilities
commission
in
ohio,
they
get
little
rules
and
they
have
a
rule
that
there
must
be
a
minimum
stated
in
the
contract,
that
you
must
guarantee
a
minimum
of
so
many
tons
and
i'll
be
frank
to
say
that
generally,
you
put
in
a
hundred
tons
and
you
know
if
you've
got
a
hundred
tons
a
year,
you're
going
to
go
broke.
that
satisfies
the
public
utilities
commission.
i
tested
them
once.
i've
been
my
contract
that
we
will
--
the
shipper
guarantees
to
the
contract
carrier
all
the
freight
that
we
ship
a
year.
i
thought
that
was
a
better
contract
for
my
clients,
and
i
would
on
--
and
i
put
on
the
evidence
of
the
amount
of
business
that
this
manufacturer
normally
shifted
on
the
years
he'd
been
in
business
and
he
expected
to
be
in
business
and
that
he's
going
to
give
this
shipper,
this
carrier
all
of
the
freight
that
he
had
and
there
was
considerable
argument,
but
i
proved
my
point
that
that
was
a
legitimate
contract.
now,
i've
gone
back
to
putting
hundred
tons
a
year
and
that
makes
everybody
happy
and
my
job
easier.
but
i
say
here
that
the
fact
that
there's
no
minimum
guarantee
isn't
the
important
thing.
the
fact
is
that
over
the
years
as
shown
in
this
evidence,
this
oklahoma
furniture
has
given
all
of
their
freight
to
these
people
to
handle
under
long
distance
transportation.
they've
gotten
all
the
freight.
and
the
fact
that
they
--
sure
they
can
hire
a
driver,
they've
got
the
union
to
overcome,
the
union
could
take
a
grievance
if
they
fire
the
man
but
they
--
the
employer
obviously
can
fire
a
driver
for
misconduct.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
these
drivers
have
been
there
over
a
long
number
of
years.
that's
the
proof
to
pudding,
what's
been
the
result?
these
drivers
have
affirmed
the
job
and
the
company
has
kept
their
leases.
they
--
if
they
did
fire
a
driver
today,
they
can't
cancel
that
lease
for
30
days
and
that
man
is
going
to
get
his
money
from
that
truck
for
30
days.
it's
true
that
he
wouldn't
have
to
drive
it,
he
wouldn't
have
to
assign
it,
i
suppose,
but
the
facts
of
the
matter
is
that
over
the
years,
these
people
have
been
employed
and
the
truck
has
been
used.
that's
the
proof
of
the
thing.
if
i
can't
enlighten
the
court,
i
will
--
i
have
completed
everything
i
think
i
can
say
on
this
subject.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
thank
you.
