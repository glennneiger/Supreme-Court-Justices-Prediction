mr.
william
l.
peterson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
several
material
facts
that
i
don't
feel
have
been
brought
out
and
i'd
like
to
do
so
at
this
time.
first
of
all,
oklahoma
furniture
manufacturing
company
manufactures
low
cost
furniture.
it
is
the
cheapest
furniture
that
can
be
purchased
in
the
industry
and
that
type
of
business,
that
type
of
manufacturing
is
extremely
competitive,
the
most
competitive
of
the
industry.
now,
oklahoma
charges
for
this
furniture
based
on
a
zonal
basis.
and
the
--
the
zonal
base
or
the
zonal
price
for
the
furniture
is
not
dependent
upon
the
distance
of
the
place
of
sale
from
guthrie,
oklahoma.
that's
dependent
more
upon
the
competition
within
the
area.
now,
oklahoma
has
always
tried
to
be
and
we
feel
it
has
always
been
a
private
carrier.
the
reasons
that
it
has
been
a
private
carrier
because
this
is
light
bulky
cargo,
hauling
furniture
and
it's
undesirable
from
a
for-hire
carriage
standpoint
and
there
is
only
one
carrier,
the
record
reflects
that
there
is
only
one
carrier
which
hauls
from
guthrie
uncrated
furniture
and
this
carrier
goes
only
west.
now,
the
reason
that
the
crating
is
extremely
important
is
that
this
is
inexpensive
furniture
and
the
cost
of
crating
remains
the
same,
so
therefore
the
cost
of
crating
furniture,
if
oklahoma
had
the
haul
crated,
would
make
it
extremely
high.
in
1952
when
this
lease
arrangement
was
changed
over,
the
company
--
and
the
company
counsel
submitted
the
lease
agreement
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
representative
in
oklahoma
city
and
he
made
suggestions
to
the
lease
arrangements
which
were
complied
with,
and
then
that
lease
arrangement
was
put
into
effect.
after
arkansas
declared
in
the
action
which
has
been
mentioned
that
these
drivers
were
contract
carriers
within
arkansas,
oklahoma
furniture
through
its
vice
president,
mr.
walker,
and
the
company
counsel
again
went
to
fort
worth
this
time
to
talk
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
representatives
there.
and
the
record
shows
that
at
that
time,
it
was
suggested
that
this
arrangement
was
wrong
because
oklahoma
furniture
didn't
have
control
and
that
these
people
weren't
drivers
or
weren't
employees.
and
therefore,
the
present
lease
arrangements
were
drawn
in
our
effort
to
make
these
men
employees
of
the
company.
now,
under
this
--
under
this
lease
agreement,
oklahoma
obtains
the
complete
right
to
use
that
truck,
and
it
has
a
right
to
hire
and
fire
the
drivers
independently
of
the
lease
agreement.
under
the
union
contract,
of
course,
these
men
aren't
treated
as
employees.
after
this,
the
change
in
the
operation
was
substantial
really
because
oklahoma
provided
--
after
that
provided
workmen's
compensation,
social
security,
it
gave
these
drivers
vacation
benefits
and
military
service
benefits
and
things
of
that
nature.
and
therefore,
we
feel
that
these
men
have
been
made
employees.
if
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
now
talk
just
a
little
bit
about
this
aspect
of
control.
mr.
ginnane
stated
that
he
was
making
no
issue
as
to
this
control
but
you'll
find
on
page
17
of
their
brief
in
footnote
8,
where
it
states
in
this
appeal,
we
do
not
challenge
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
the
evidence
did
not
want
a
finding
that
oklahoma
lack
control
of
the
details
of
the
operation
nor
do
we
argue
as
to
whether
the
court
below
gave
too
narrow
meaning
to
the
commission's
control
test.
we
assume,
for
present
purposes
that
the
court
below
correctly
apply
that
test
as
relating
only
to
the
operational
aspects
of
the
transportation.
in
other
words,
what
mr.
ginnane
is
saying
in
his
brief
and
before
you
is
that
he
admits
control,
but
he
admits
upon
his
terms.
the
court
in
this
case
said
that
oklahoma
directed,
dominated,
and
controlled,
(1)
the
transportation
of
its
products,
(2)
the
equipment
concerned
therewith,
and
(3),
the
personnel
concerned
therewith.
in
other
words,
this
is
oklahoma's
operation
as
a
private
carrier
and
not
the
operation
of
these
people
as
contract
carriers.
now,
we
don't
feel
that
mr.
ginnane
has
the
right
to
assume
things
about
the
district
court's
opinion
which
was
not
there.
now,
the
district
court
arrived
at
--
arrived
at
each
conclusion
and
decision
in
this
case
based
upon
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
transaction
together
with
the
actual
practices
there
under.
and
it
quoted
from
the
commission
decision
of
h.b.
church
truck
service
company
common
carrier
application.
the
question
as
to
who
has
a
right
to
control
and
direct
must
be
answered
in
the
light
of
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
transaction
between
the
carrier
and
shipper
and
of
the
actual
practices
in
the
conduct
to
the
operation
there
under.
no
element
of
such
facts
and
circumstances
is
by
itself
controlling.
well,
if
the
court
did
which
i'm
sure
that
it
did
and
that
the
states
did,
examine
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
transaction
which
currently
includes
these
methods
of
payment
then
it
just
as
much
in
a
position
to
answer
whether
or
not
these
men
are
in
substance
or
engaged
in
transportation,
for-hire
as
it
is
whether
or
not
these
men
or
whether
or
not
the
company
has
the
right
to
direct
control
and
dominate
the
transportation
service.
in
other
words,
all
these
things
were
considered
by
the
district
court.
another
thing
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
i
take
it
that
their
argument
here
is
that
these
men
have
the
essential
risk
of
engaging
in
the
transportation
service.
that
isn't
correct.
these
men
leased
their
tractors
to
oklahoma
and
of
course
it's
payable
on
a
cents
per
mile
basis.
these
men
are
not
(inaudible)
truck
people,
and
it
would
be
--
there
would
be
more
risk
to
these
men
involved
in
a
flat
rate
method
of
payment
than
it
would
be
on
a
cents
per
mile,
because
the
gas
is
burned
on
a
mileage
basis.
the
oil
is
used
on
mileage
basis
and
when
these
men
determined,
what's
it
is
going
to
take
to
run
that
equipment,
it's
all
done
on
a
mileage
basis.
that's
the
most
accurate
way
that
you
could
arrive
at
any
type
of
expense.
now
oklahoma
pays
for
transportation
itself.
in
other
words,
the
rent
payment
is
made
regardless
of
whether
or
not
there's
anything
hauled.
anywhere
these
trucks
go,
the
rental
payment
is
due
and
the
wages
of
the
drivers
is
due.
mr.
william
l.
peterson,
jr.
well
i
don't
--
i
don't
really
know
that
that
would
be
material
if
that's
the
only
thing.
of
course,
they
haven't
suggested
it
to
us
before.
perhaps,
we
would
have
put
in
a
minimum
mileage,
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
material
in
this
case
because
here's
a
situation
where
a
close
relationship
between
the
company
and
these
men.
now,
the
record
indicates
that
--
well,
in
two
instances
here,
that
drivers
were
first
--
the
drivers
of
the
company
owned
vehicles
and
they
were
promoted
up
through
the
ranks.
now,
these
men
know
how
much
transportation
oklahoma
does.
they
know
that
that
equipment
is
going
to
be
used.
they
know
it.
now
i
know
there's
no
minimum
in
there,
but
we'd
be
happy
to
supply
one
if
that's
the
only
objection
and
in
this
connection,
if
the
equipment
goes
out
loaded
and
comes
back
unloaded,
it's
oklahoma
who
bears
that
cost.
and
also
oklahoma
will
bear
the
risk
of
efficiently
or
inefficiently
loading
that
equipment
when
it
goes
out
and
oklahoma
directs
all
those
movements,
and
oklahoma
also
selects
this
equipment
and
names
the
driver
to
drive
it.
now
normally,
that
is
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
because
the
company
has
found
that
they
have
a
better
safety
record
when
that's
done
and
the
equipment
is
better
maintained
when
the
owner
drives
it.
but
there
are
instances
in
this
record
where
oklahoma
assigns
different
drivers
to
different
trucks.
in
other
words,
that's
not
an
ironclad
rule
and
the
district
court's
opinion
reflects
that
this
is
done
whenever
business,
reasons
or
convenience
make
it
necessary.
so
for
this
reason,
we
feel
that
there
is
no
merit
to
the
questions
presented
by
the
government.
mr.
william
l.
peterson,
jr.
absolutely
not.
they
have
never
done
that
and
the
record
indicates
that
neither
that
has
been
done
nor
has
the
--
nor
have
the
goods
of
any
other
person
been
hauled
with
these
trucks
and
incidentally,
oklahoma
owns
all
of
the
trailers,
there
are
26
trailers
utilizing
this
operation,
oklahoma
owns
everyone
of
them
out
front.
mr.
william
l.
peterson,
jr.
loss
from
the
failure
to
use
--
mr.
william
l.
peterson,
jr.
well,
that's
--
mr.
william
l.
peterson,
jr.
well,
i'd
have
to
say
that
the
lessor
does.
but
it's
never
happened
nor
has
--
nor
was
the
question
asked.
mr.
william
l.
peterson,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
necessarily
that
there
would
be
any
loss
from
the
truck.
mr.
william
l.
peterson,
jr.
well
the
overhead
would
be
borne
to
oklahoma.
i
turn
the
balance
of
the
time
over
to
mr.
iden.
mr.
william
l.
peterson,
jr.
well
yes,
your
honor
under
the
present
agreement,
it
would
be
but
insofar
as
i
know
that's
never
happened
in
the
history
of
all
these,
nor
was
the
question
even
asked
by
the
commission
in
the
record.
in
other
words,
whether
or
not
there's
have
been
a
profit
or
loss
by
these
lessors
from
this
lease
agreement,
was
never
even
asked,
and
the
record
won't
indicate
whether
or
not
oklahoma
is
making
a
profit
or
loss
from
engaging
in
this
transportation
as
a
private
carriage,
likewise
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
now,
those
are
financial
aspects
that
--
i
believe
that
you're
talking
about
in
the
record
just
isn't
broad
enough
to
cover
them.
mr.
william
l.
peterson,
jr.
yes,
i
--
mr.
william
l.
peterson,
jr.
that's
correct.
