justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
ginnane,
as
i
understood
your
argument,
you
say
that
there
can
be
no
private
carrier
relations
here
if
the
known
--
the
costs
are
fixed
and
known
on
the
mileage
basis
and
the
lessor
of
the
leases
--
the
vehicles
assumes
all
the
risks.
now,
do
you
limit
that
to
a
situation
where
the
vehicles
are
leased
from
the
same
persons
as
hire
their
services
to
drive
them
or
would
it
make
a
difference?
wouldn't
the
same
cost
be
known
if
the
leases
were
from
some
independent
truck
leasing
company,
and
then
these
men
merely
hired
their
services,
wouldn't
the
claim
cost
be
known?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
they
would
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
the
common
practice.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
legally
required
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
if
some
truck
leasing
company
deviated
and
did
lease
on
a
mileage
basis,
and
then
certain
drivers
hired
their
services
independently,
would
not
the
same
fixed
mileage
cost
that
you
complain
of
exist?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
your
complaint
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
your
complaint
then
is
that
really
because
they've
gotten
both
the
vehicle
and
the
driving
services
from
the
same
man
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
oklahoma
--
i
think
that
mr.
ginnane's
real
point
in
that
connection
was
that
no
minimums
are
guaranteed
and
no
amount
of
mileage
is
stipulated
–
guaranteed.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
we
don't
have
such
a
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
didn't
you
answer
to
my
question,
answered
to
me
that
the
vice
in
here
in
leasing
entirely
this
--
from
the
same
man,
leasing
from
a
particular
person
and
hiring
that
particular
person
to
drive
the
truck.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
what
respect,
if
it
all
if
i
may
ask,
does
the
commission's
ruling
set
forth
at
pages
31
--
21
and
22
of
the
brief
of
respondent
drum
vary
from
the
judgment
we
are
asked
to
review
here?
starting
out
the
question,
“do
the
regulations
apply
to
the
leasing
of
equipment
of
private
carriers
or
shippers
by
a
person
not
an
authorized
carrier?”
answer
of
the
commission:
“no.
the
regulations
have
no
application
to
such
leasing
arrangements.
for
such
an
arrangement
to
be
proper,
the
leased
vehicle
must
be
transferred
to
the
shipper's
possession
and
be
operated
under
the
shipper's
complete
direction
and
control
by
the
shipper's
own
driver.”
is
the
shipper
responsible
to
the
public
in
case
of
accident
and
responsible
to
the
commission
for
compliance
with
the
safety
regulations,
etc?
is
there
a
variation
in
the
judgment
below
from
that
ruling?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
understand
mr.
ginnane
not
to
deny
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
because
he
didn't
bring
that
question
here.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
therefore,
i
ask
you,
what's
the
difference
between
what
the
commission
says
is
the
proper
understanding
of
its
regulations
and
the
effect
given
them
by
the
court
below.
is
there
a
difference?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
this
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
ginnane,
are
you
aware
of
any
repudiation
by
the
commission
of
its
ruling
quoted
on
page
21
and
22
of
mr.
--
of
the
respondent's
brief,
the
one
that
i
referred
to
a
while
ago?
