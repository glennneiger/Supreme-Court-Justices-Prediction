mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
sharing
the
argument
with
mr.
rice
who
was
counsel
for
the
regular
common
carrier
conference
of
the
american
trucking
association.
we
have
endeavored
to
divide
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
minimize
repetition.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
on
a
three-judge
court
in
the
western
district
of
oklahoma.
it
involves
a
single
question
wether
the
oklahoma
furniture
company
is
engaged
in
true
private
carriage
in
the
transportation
of
its
products
and
inbound
raw
materials
or
whether
it
is
buying
a
for-hire
contract
carrier
service
on
drum
and
the
individual
--
other
individual
appellees.
after
a
hearing,
the
commission
had
held
that
there
was
not
involved
bona
fide
private
carriage
by
the
shipper,
oklahoma,
but
rather
that
oklahoma
was
buying
transportation
service
in
a
form
of
contract
carriage
from
the
individual
owner-operators
of
truck
tractors.
the
three-judge
court
set
aside
the
commission's
order.
it
held
that
the
record
compel
the
conclusion
that
oklahoma
was
in
fact
engaging
in
bona
fide
private
transportation.
in
our
jurisdictional
statement,
but
we
did
not
repeat
it
in
our
brief,
we
stated
our
reasons
for
believing
that
this
case
warranted
consideration
by
this
court.
because
as
we
see
it,
it
involves
a
great
deal
more
than
whether
these
11
men
--
11
small
businessmen
were
--
can
transport
merchandise
for
oklahoma
furniture
company.
the
public
transportation
industry
is
in
serious
trouble
for
a
variety
of
causes
such
as
overcapacity,
taxation
and
other
causes
which
are
not
involved
in
this
case.
but
this
case
does
involve
one
of
those
causes,
one
of
those
underlying
problems.
and
that
has
been
the
record
almost
dramatic
diversion
of
traffic
available
to
regulated
public
carriers
to
unregulated
or
unlawful
forms
of
transportation.
now,
a
private
carrier
is
one
who
transports
his
own
goods.
in
furtherance
of
some
business
enterprise
is
a
--
a
primary
business
enterprise
other
than
transportation.
that
distinguishes
him
from
a
motor
common
or
a
motor
contract
or
a
rail
carrier
who
was
transporting
the
property
of
other
persons
for
compensation.
this
trend
has
been
of
continuing
concern
now
for
several
years
to
the
congress.
that
concern
has
shown
up
in
some
amendments
in
1957
and
1958
relating
to
private
carriage
which
we'll
refer
to
in
our
brief.
it's
been
articulated
most
effectively
in
committee
reports,
thus
the
senate
committee
stated
in
1958
that
the
enormous
growth
of
commercial
private
carriage
of
property
by
motor
vehicles
in
recent
years,
resulting
as
it
has
in
a
continuing
erosion
of
huge
volumes
of
traffic
that
would
otherwise
be
available
for
transportation
by
public
carriers
is
a
serious
problem
of
the
railroads
and
other
common
carriers.
that
committee
went
on
to
point
out
that
no
one
can
quarrel
with
bona
fide
private
carriers
but
it
went
on
to
point
out
that
there
exist
a
large
amount
of
what
is
called
pseudo
private
carriage,
transportation
for-hire,
unauthorized
by
any
regulatory
agency
and
which
is
performed
under
the
guise
of
private
transportation.
this
can't
be
measured
statistically
in
the
absence
of
anything
like
--
something
like
a
transportation
census,
that
every
informed
person
connected
with
the
transportation
industry
regards
it
as
a
significant
cause
of
the
erosion
of
the
public
carrier
industry
on
which
so
many
shippers
depend.
the
nearest
thing
to
a
real
study
on
this
was
made
in
june
1960
by
the
commission's
bureau
of
transport
economics
for
the
senate
committee
on
interstate
commerce.
a
study
entitled
“gray
area
of
transportation
operations.”
this
study
found
that
various
leasing
devices,
leases
between
the
shippers
and
people
who
own
vehicles,
that
various
leasing
devices
constitute
the
most
prevalent
type
of
gray
area
operation
at
present.
and
that
a
large
part
of
the
gray
area
operators'
traffic
is
a
direct
diversion
from
existing
public
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
no
indeed.
by
public
carriers,
i
mean
authorized
common
and
contract
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
we
wouldn't
be.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
largely
undisputed
and
they're
based
largely
upon
the
terms
of
written
agreements
between
oklahoma
and
the
11
owner-operators.
oklahoma
manufactures
low
price
furniture
in
guthrie,
oklahoma
which
it
sells
to
dealers
located
over
a
wide
area
of
united
states.
prior
to
october
1952,
oklahoma
moved
its
product
in
tractors
and
trailers
which
it
owned
outright
and
which
were
driven
by
salaried
employees,
admittedly
that
was
bona
fide
private
carriage.
however,
about
that
time,
oklahoma
discovered
that
it
was
being
defrauded
on
a
fairly
large
scale
by
its
drivers
misusing
company
credit
cards.
so
it
changed
its
long
haul
operations,
those
to
the
further
points,
to
a
system
under
which
drivers
would
own
and
maintain
their
own
tractors.
oklahoma
contended
to
own
the
trailers.
the
drivers
would
own
and
maintain
their
own
tractors
and
pay
their
own
operating
expenses.
that
is,
their
living
expenses
on
the
road,
gasoline,
lubricants
and
so
on.
and
they
would
be
a
compensated
on
a
mileage
basis.
now,
this
original
lease
arrangement
required
that
the
owner-operator
had
--
undertake
to
provide
at
his
own
expense
property
damage
and
public
liability
insurance
and
to
comply
with
workmen's
compensation
laws
with
respect
to
any
persons
that
were
employed,
the
social
security
benefits.
and
the
owner-operator
under
this
original
lease
reserved
the
right
to
use
the
equipment
in
the
service
of
any
other
shipper
when
it
was
not
requiring
the
service
of
oklahoma.
but
in
1956,
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
held
that
the
owner-operators
under
this
first
lease
were
performing
a
transportation
service
for-hire
as
contract
carriers
and
were
not
merely
employees
of
oklahoma
in
the
performance
of
private
transportation.
so
july
1957,
a
new
lease
was
drawn
and
that's
the
lease
which
is
now
in
effect
and
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
it's
in
effect
except
as
modified
in
one
respect
as
i
point
out
later
on
by
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
present
lease
provides
that
oklahoma
has
the
sole
right
to
control
the
use
of
vehicles
with
one
exception;
it
may
not
sublease
the
vehicles
to
other
persons.
the
lease
has
reappeared
every
year
but
may
be
cancelled
on
30
days
written
notice
by
either
party.
payment
for
the
use
of
the
vehicle
as
for
the
owner-operator
services
as
the
driver
is
based
exclusively
on
mileage.
if
the
vehicle
is
not
used,
no
payment
is
due
from
oklahoma.
oklahoma
does
not
bind
itself
to
provide
any
owner-operator
with
as
much
as
one
pound
of
freight.
it's
essentially
an
option.
and
oklahoma
does
not
utilize
the
owner-operators
and
their
trucks
everyday.
now,
the
lease
provides
that
oklahoma
would
keep
the
lease
vehicles
in
repair,
but
as
the
court
below
found
and
is
not
disputed
under
a
later
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
owner-operators
are
bound
to
maintain
and
repair
their
own
vehicles
at
their
own
expense.
oklahoma
inspects
the
vehicles
for
compliance
with
icc
safety
regulations
although
the
repairs
necessary
for
such
compliance,
as
i
say,
are
paid
for
by
the
owner-operators.
and
the
owner-operators
paid
the
ordinary
operating
expenses,
gasoline,
lubricants,
their
living
expenses
on
the
road
and
so
on.
under
a
separate
contract,
oklahoma
retains
the
owner-operators
as
drivers.
as
drivers,
they
are
paid
5
cents
a
mille
with
an
extra
penny
on
the
return
trip
if
they
are
back
hauling
raw
materials.
that
is
5
cents
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they're
paid
5
cents
a
mile
with
an
extra
cent
for
a
mile
on
the
return
trip
if
they
are
carrying
inbound
raw
materials.
but
they
are
paid
only
when
they
work
on
this
mileage
basis.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
its
10
cents
--
10
or
11
cents
depending
upon
the
type
of
trailer
used
for
the
entire
trip,
inbound
and
outbound.
but
if
they're
back
hauling
from
the
return
trip,
they're
carrying
raw
materials
then
in
addition
to
that
10
cents
or
11
depending
on
the
type
of
trailer,
they
get
an
additional
3
cents
per
mile
while
back
hauling
the
raw
materials.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
owner-operators
get
vacation
benefits
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract
if
they
drive
as
much
as
75,000
miles
a
year.
each
owner-operator
operates
his
own
tractor
except
in
cases
of
emergency.
under
this
general
set
up,
oklahoma
leases
11
tractors
from
11
owner-operators.
in
addition,
oklahoma
owns
itself
six
tractors.
these
company-owned
tractors
are
driven
by
six
drivers
who
are
compensated
at
the
rate
of
$50
a
week
as
a
base
salary
plus
2
cents
for
each
mile
that
they
drive.
and
as
i
say,
the
trailers
as
distinguished
from
tractors,
all
of
the
trailers
are
owned
by
oklahoma.
the
owner-operators
and
their
tractors
are
used
largely
on
the
long
haul
trips
whereas
the
company-owned
vehicles
where
the
salary
drivers
are
used
for
the
short
haul
trips
near
the
haul
plant.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
the
company
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
company
owns
the
vehicles
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
on
a
salary
basis.
that's
right
sir.
that
is
not
an
issue.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oklahoma
issues
two
weekly
checks
to
each
owner-operator,
one
for
the
use
of
his
tractor
and
one
for
his
services
as
driver.
the
company
pays
social
security
taxes
upon
the
payments
which
are
made
to
the
owner-operator
as
driver
and
it
withholds
income
taxes
from
that
portion.
under
the
second
lease,
oklahoma
carries
the
property
damage
and
public
liability
insurance.
but
any
collision,
fire
or
theft
insurance
on
the
tractor
must
be
paid
for
by
the
owner-operator.
the
risk
of
cargo
insurance
is
borne
by
oklahoma
and
not
by
the
owner-operators.
now,
the
commission
found
that
the
owner-operators
were
engaged
and
performing
motor
contract
carriage
for
hire
and
without
the
appropriate
contract
carrier
purpose.
in
arriving
at
that
conclusion,
the
commission
stated,
as
it
has
in
other
cases,
that
two
questions
would
have
to
be
answered
in
the
negative
before
it
could
find
that
the
operations
were
bona
fide
private
carriage
conducted
by
oklahoma.
first,
is
the
transportation
here
involved
such
that
any
person
or
persons
other
than
oklahoma
has
any
right
to
direct
control
or
dominate
it,
and
two,
or
any
persons
here
in
substance
engaged
in
the
business
of
interstate
transportation
of
property
for-hire.
applying
the
first
test,
the
commission
held
that
the
company
did
not
have
a
sufficiently
exclusive
right
and
privilege
to
control
the
transportation
operation.
in
applying
the
second
test
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
it's
a
very
good
question.
they
weren't
exercising
sufficient
control
over
to
the
exclusion
of
owner-operator
control
of
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
perhaps
so,
sir.
then
the
commission
also
applied
the
ultimate
test
and
answered
it
in
the
negative
because
it
concluded
that
each
owner-operator
was
providing
contract
carrier
service
and
that
he
--
and
i
quote,
“he
guarantees
a
fixed
and
definite
cost
for
the
transportation,
bears
the
risk
of
profit
or
loss
from
such
transportation
hazards
as
delays
in
transit
and
meets
all
the
cost
of
operation.”
now,
the
three-judge
court
held
or
assumed
that
the
commission
had
invoked
proper
test
but
it
held
that
it
had
misapplied
them
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
three-judge
court
held
that
the
company
had
the
right
to
and
actually
did
control
the
rec
--
and
dominate
the
transportation
of
its
products
and
held
that
the
owner-operators
were
not
in
substance
engaged
in
the
business
of
transportation
for-hire.
it
said
they
were
merely
employees
of
the
company
and
we're
so
considered
by
both
the
company
and
themselves.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
insofar
as
this
record
shows,
they
were
not.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there's
some
testimony
and
it's
uncontradicted
that
they
were
not
used
in
the
service
of
other
shippers.
now,
the
three-judge
court
in
its
opinion,
discussed
to
some
extent
its
view
that
oklahoma
did
possess
sufficient
control
under
the
control
test.
but
they
didn't
discuss
their
rejection
of
the
commission's
alternate
conclusion
that
the
owner-operators
were
engaged
in
transportation
for-hire.
in
that
they
are
assuming
all
of
the
risks
of
providing
transportation
for
oklahoma
at
a
definite
preestablished
cost.
now,
in
this
appeal,
we
haven't
asked
the
court
to
review
the
lower
court's
conclusions
on
the
facts
of
control.
now,
we
have
that
sort
of
litigation
in
the
federal
--
lower
federal
courts
all
the
time
and
these
facts
of
incidence
of
control
vary
from
case
to
case
that
are
essentially
factual
issues
which
is
why
we
didn't
try
to
bring
it
here.
rather
our
appeal
is
limited
to
the
other
alternate
test
which
the
commission
applied.
we
think
that
if
a
shipper
such
as
oklahoma
doesn't
exercise
control
and
a
complete
control
over
the
transportation
of
its
goods
then
obviously,
it
can't
be
engaged
in
bona
fide
private
carriage
but
we
think
the
converse
is
not
true
that
a
shipper
can
still
have
complete
control
over
the
operating
incidence
of
the
transportation
and
somebody
else
can
still
be
providing
service
for-hire.
now,
for
example,
the
operations
of
an
admitted
contract
carrier
frequently
will
be
under
such
detailed
control
by
the
shipper.
as
to
constitute
as
a
practical
matter,
the
shippers
traffic
the
public.
so
we
say
that
that
commission
has
to
look
beyond
operating
control
to
say
who
in
economic
reality,
is
providing
the
transportation
service
undertaking
the
burdens
and
the
risks
of
providing
the
transportation
service.
we
think
that
the
court
below
erred
in
not
going
further
than
it
did.
now,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
we
are
in
no
way
attacking
or
criticizing
bona
fide
private
carriage.
thousands
of
shippers
in
this
kind,
an
increasing
number
in
fact
are
transporting
their
own
goods
and
vehicles
which
they
own
and
driven
by
their
employers.
and
we
don't
contend
that
private
carriers
may
not
lease
the
vehicles
from
other
persons.
many
do
from
established
rental
organization
say
like
hertz
or
the
ryder
rental
system.
renting
of
equipment
takes
place
on
a
large
scale.
but
in
all
those
typical
commercial
rental
contracts,
there's
a
minimum
rental
charge
so
that
the
burden
of
non-utilization
of
equipment
is
borne
not
by
the
lessor
but
by
the
shipper
lessee.
we
contend
that
in
determining
--
in
drawing
a
line
between
private
carriage
and
contract
carriage
that
determine
must
be
--
determination
must
be
made
in
a
way
that
will
carry
out
the
broad
statutory
objectives
in
providing
for
economic
regulation
of
motor
transportations.
generally,
that
objective
was
to
provide
a
sound
transportation
system
by
restricting
for-hire
transportation,
commercial
transportation
to
authorized
carriers.
now,
bona
fide
private
carriage
is
exempt
from
the
economic
regulation
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
for
some
shippers
in
some
circumstances,
it
offers
true
economies
and
other
advantages.
but
private
carriage,
bona
fide
private
carriage
involves
some
inherent
disadvantages
too.
it
begins
with
an
investment
in
equipment.
and
there's
the
problem
of
supervising
drivers
on
the
far
flung
operation,
the
difficulty
that
oklahoma
ran
into.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
essentially
undisputed
facts
which
i
presented
yesterday,
the
question
here
is
whether
okalahoma
furniture
company
is
engaged
in
genuine
private
carriage.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
we
state
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now
we
assume
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal,
that
they
sufficiently
discussed
the
factor
of
oklahoma's
control
over
the
transportation
operations.
what
we
think
the
court
below
failed
to
do
was
to
pursue
the
alternative
test
as
to
whether
--
as
to
who
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
test.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
to
who
was
assuming
the
financial
risks
and
burdens
of
providing
the
transportation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir,
that's
all
we
urge.
we
urged
yesterday
that
the
test
to
be
applied
should
be
formulated
in
terms
of
the
objectives
of
economic
regulation
of
motor
carriers.
that
one
of
the
principal
objectives
was
to
encourage
the
development
of
a
sound
public
transportation
system
by
restricting,
with
exceptions,
for
higher
transportation
to
authorized
carriers.
at
the
same
time,
the
act
permits
genuine
private
carriage.
in
realization
of
the
fact
that
in
some
circumstances
for
some
shippers,
a
private
carriage
provides
genuine
economies
or
other
advantages.
but
normally,
we
think
of
private
carriage
as
the
situation
where
the
shipper
obtains
separately
the
elements
of
transportation,
the
equipment,
labor,
fuel,
and
so
on
and
by
his
own
management
and
judgment
puts
them
together
into
a
transportation
facility
for
the
transportation
of
his
own
goods
and
at
the
same
time,
there
are
risks,
inherent
risks
and
disadvantages
in
genuine
private
carriage.
there's
the
investment
and
equipment
either
by
way
of
purchase
or
by
lease.
there's
the
problem
of
supervision
of
drivers
scattered
all
over
the
country,
the
point
at
which
oklahoma
encountered
difficulty
in
its
earlier
operations.
and
there
is
the
problem
of
getting
a
balanced
movement,
inbound
and
outbound
and
above
all,
there's
the
risk
of
non-utilization
of
equipment
depending
upon
the
fluctuations
in
business.
but
as
long
as
the
shipper
is
willing
to
assume
those
risks
and
burdens,
then
his
private
carrier
operations
present
no
problem
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
because
natural
economic
forces
will
limit
the
extent
to
which
private
carriage
diverts
traffic
from
the
public
transportation
industry.
it's
when
we
get
into
variations
from
what
is
clearly
an
admittedly
private
carriage
that
we
need
some
kind
of
a
realistic
test.
and
we
find
that
test
suggested
in
this
court's
decision
in
silk
v.
united
states
in
331
u.s.,
in
which
this
court
held
that
owner-operators
and
the
facts
of
that
case
were
not
employees
for
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act.
now,
of
course
that
status
of
employee
isn't
necessarily
the
same
for
statute
with
different
purposes,
but
we
think
your
honors
did
suggest
what
the
approach
should
be.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
i
answer
you
this
way.
under
the
so-called
control
test
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
i
think
that's
a
relative
matter.
may
i
answer
you
this
way?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
under
the
contest
of
who
actually
controls
the
various
aspects
of
the
transportation
operation,
you
get
infinite
variations
on
those
control
facts,
and
indeed
that's
why
we
did
not
present
the
control
--
the
physical
control
aspect
of
the
case
to
this
court,
it's
so
much
a
fact
question,
varies
from
some
situation
of
situation,
we
didn't
think
we
should
bring
it
here.
the
alternative
test,
we
think,
is
of
more
generalized
applicability
who
--
looking
in
the
allocation
of
risks
and
costs
and
you
can
tell
that
by
and
large
from
un
--
the
undisputed
contractual
arrangements
between
the
parties,
who
is
taking
the
risks
of
performing
a
transportation
service?
is
the
shipper
taking
those
risks,
or
is
the
shipper
buying
transportation
on
a
unit
on
a
per
mile
basis
at
a
predetermined
cost
to
him?
now
there
are
--
certainly
there
are
going
to
be
variations
on
that.
but
if
your
--
but
if
your
honors
sustain
our
contention,
it
will
be
an
extremely
useful
generality
to
all
concerned
in
the
transportation
business.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for
economic
regulations.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for
economic
regulations.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
of
course
not.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
district
court
could
have
held
it
--
could
have
decided
in
this
case
depending
upon
the
facts
that
--
no,
the
commission
was
wrong
in
fact,
that
oklahoma
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
oklahoma
was
assuming
the
burdens
and
risks
of
engaging
in
transportation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
so
that
we
can
apply
a
consistent
and
nondiscriminatory
pattern.
now,
the
language
that
your
honors
used
in
the
silk
case
which
we
think
provides
the
guide
here
and
i
quote,
“the
social
security
agency
and
the
courts
will
find
that
degrees
of
control,
opportunities
for
profit
or
loss,
permanency
of
relation,
and
skill
required
in
the
claimed
independent
operation
are
important
for
decision.
no
one
is
controlling
nor
is
the
list
complete,”
in
other
words,
if
we're
to
look
at
the
total
situation,
including
the
risk
undertaken
and
who
is
undertaking
the
risk
to
find
the
economic
reality.
now,
turning
to
these
arrangements
here,
under
these
contractual
arrangements,
oklahoma
--
between
oklahoma
and
the
owner-operators,
each
owner-operator
provides
a
tractor
which
he
drives
himself
except
in
unusual
circumstances
for
both
the
use
of
his
vehicle
and
for
his
services
as
driver.
the
owner-operator
is
paid
on
a
mileage
basis,
strictly
on
a
mileage
basis
for
transportation
actually
performed.
the
owner-operator
bears
the
cost,
the
investment,
and
the
vehicle,
the
operating
expenses
and
the
entire
risk
of
the
non-utilization
of
equipment.
now
the
separate
leasing
and
collective
bargaining
agreements
seemed
to
say
that
the
owner-operators
are
separately
selling
their
services
and
the
use
of
their
equipment,
but
the
under
like
--
underlying
reality
is
brought
out
by
two
contracts
in
this
record.
first
a
per
mile
rate,
strictly
a
per
mile
rate,
the
owner-operators
received
for
the
use
of
their
equipment
is
to
be
compared
with
the
minimum
or
overhead
charge
plus
mileage
which
characterizes
all
commercial
renting
of
vehicles
whether
one
of
us
goes
to
rent
an
automobile
from
a
drive-it-yourself
organization
or
to
rent
big
truck
tractor.
those
organizations
simply
will
not
rent
on
a
straight
per
mile
basis
and
take
all
the
risk
of
the
car
or
the
truck
sitting
around.
secondly
the
per
mile
rate
at
which
the
owner-operators
are
compensated
for
driving,
is
to
be
compared
with
the
weekly
salary
plus
mileage,
which
oklahoma
pays
the
drivers
of
the
tractors
which
it
owns.
the
economic
reality
is
that
the
owner-operators
by
assuming
the
risks
of
transportation
are
selling
transportation
to
oklahoma
at
a
predetermined
cost
per
mile
for
such
transportation
as
is
actually
performed.
and
this
predetermined
cost
consists
of
the
mileage
payments
to
the
owner-operators
for
the
use
of
their
vehicles
and
for
their
services
plus
the
readily
allocable
cost
of
social
security
which
is
measured
by
the
salary
payment
by
the
driver
--
payments
made
to
the
drivers,
liability,
insurance
and
the
vacation
benefits.
we
think
on
those
facts,
the
owner-operators
are
contract
carriers
and
that
oklahoma
is
not
engaged
in
private
carriage.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
11
contract
carriers.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
they
are
acting
in
concert.
now,
i'd
like
to
dis
--
to
characterize
briefly
the
various
elements
on
which
oklahoma
relies
for
a
contrary
conclusion.
most
of
the
factors
of
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
in
the
collective
bargaining
here,
the
owner-operators
are
dealt
within
a
separate
appendix
somewhat
as
they
were
in
their
agreement
involved
in
the
case
your
honors
had
last
term,
the
oliver
case.
it's
a
separate
specialized
treatment
in
this
--
in
an
appendix
effected
by
the
agreement.
it
appears
in
the
record
at
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
this
separate
appendix
appears
in
the
record
at
page
142
and
as
to
how
they're
characterized
it
says,
the
company
has
heretofore
had
certain
truck
drivers
operating
under
separate
contracts
which
contracts
are
to
be
abrogated
in
a
new
classification
of
truck
driver
employees
is
hereby
created
known
as
truck
drivers
and
maintenance
men
and
this
agreement
involves
only
such
employees.
and
then
it
contains
specialized
provisions.
for
example,
under
the
general
agreement,
the
regular
salaried
employees
become
entitled
to
a
vacation
benefits
if
they
work
at
least
1900
hours
in
the
period.
as
applied
to
these
owner-operators,
they
become
entitled
to
vacation
benefits
if
they
had
driven
at
least
75,000
miles.
in
other
words,
the
separate
appendix
provides
special
treatment
for
the
owner-operators.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
wasn't
that,
as
i
recall,
sir
that
was
pretty
much
the
problem
before
this
court
in
the
oliver
case
last
term.
and
your
honor
dissented,
as
i
recall,
on
the
ground
that
they
were
so
clearly
at
least
under
the
facts
of
those
case,
you
thought
they
were
so
clearly
independent
employees
that
they
just
didn't
belong
under
the
--
in
collective
bargaining
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
majority
of
the
court,
as
i
recall,
in
effect
held
that
the
relationship
of
these
owner-operators
to
the
overall
activities
of
the
employer,
perhaps
in
competition
would
straight
salary
employees
was
such
that
it
was
an
appropriate
subject
for
collective
bargaining
notwithstanding
the
possible
application
of
the
state
antitrust
law,
in
that
case,
the
ohio
law.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
the
face
of
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
oliver
case,
i
would
be
reluctant
to
say
so.
that
involved
the
state
antitrust
law,
but
perhaps
it
would
carry
over
to
the
federal
law.
i
don't
think
i
can
say
so
in
the
face
of
that
opinion.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
majority
opinion
did
not
discuss
the
precise
question
for
there
--
to
be
treat
--
or
to
be
categorized
as
employees
or
independent
contractors.
rather,
it's
held
that
the
basis
on
which
they
were
treated
by
the
employer
or
the
employers
was
sufficiently
related
at
least
in
terms
of
competitive
relationships
to
the
treatment
of
the
straight
salaried
employees
that
it
would
an
appropriate
subject
for
collective
bargaining,
but
without
purporting
to
define
whether
they
were
employees
or
independent
contractors.
the
most
of
the
factors
on
which
oklahoma
has
relied
at
one
time
or
another
to
indicate
that
this
is
true
private
carriage,
our
factors
which
are
equally
applicable
to
--
and
admitted
even
to
a
typical
contract
carrier
operations.
for
example
that
oklahoma
determines
when
and
where
the
vehicles
go
and
determines
the
order
of
loading.
that's
the
characteristic
of
the
contract
carriage
in
which
a
contract
carrier
in
terms
of
the
statute,
statutory
definitions
dedicates
equipment
to
the
exclusive
use
of
a
shipper.
now,
the
provision
that
in
the
equipment
leases
that
oklahoma
shall
have
exclusive
use
of
the
equipment
is
a
common
aspect
of
legal
contract
carriage.
the
fact
that
oklahoma
assumes
responsibility
for
seeing
that
there's
compliance
with
icc
safety
regulations
simply
begs
the
question,
because
those
obligations,
those
safety
obligations
are
imposed
upon
whoever
is
in
fact
engaged
in
transportation
either
as
a
contract
carrier
or
as
a
private
carrier.
the
fact
that
oklahoma
retains
responsibility
for
cargo
loses
doesn't
prove
anything
because
neither
the
interstate
commerce
act
nor
the
icc
regulations
require
a
contract
carrier
to
assume
responsibility
for
cargo
losses.
finally,
they
continue
to
suggest
that
it's
significant
that
they
retain
the
right
to
hire
and
fire
the
owner-operators
as
drivers.
by
which
i
take
it,
they
mean,
that
they
can
hire
and
fire
them
and
still
continue
to
use
the
tractors.
well,
that
--
that
just
doesn't
stand
up
because
the
lease
agreement
covering
the
tractors
is
terminable
upon
30
days
notice
by
either
party.
and
in
addition,
since
under
that
lease
agreement,
oklahoma
doesn't
obligate
itself
to
give
any
owner-operator
as
much
as
one
pound
of
freight.
it
may
well
be
void
to
run
enforceable
for
lack
of
consideration
or
lack
of
mutuality.
that
agreement
is
worth
reading
carefully,
we
submit.
our
problem
is
how
to
draw
a
practical
line
between
bona
fide
private
carriage
and
transportation
for
a
hire
which
is
disguised
in
various
leasing
arrangements.
we
think
the
lines
should
be
drawn
right
here
that
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
bona
fide
private
carriage
where
the
shipper
is
obtaining
transportation
on
a
predetermined
mileage
basis
from
owner-operators
who
are
assuming
all
the
risks
of
the
transportation
business.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
are
not
suggesting
improper
motivation
upon
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
appellees.
we
take
the
case
as
an
honest
difference
of
opinion
between
them
and
the
government
as
to
what
refers
the
line
between
a
private
carriage
and
contract
carriage.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggests
bad
faith
or
improper
motivation
on
their
part.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
this
--
well,
this
one
thing
that
prior
to
1952,
oklahoma
was
engaged
in
obviously
bona
fide
private
carriage
with
vehicles
which
it
owned
and
with
salaried
drivers.
and
the
record
indicates
that
they
stopped
that
and
switched
to
these
leasing
arrangements
when
they
discovered
that
they
were
being
defrauded
by
their
drivers
particularly
on
the
long
haul
trips
through
the
improper
use
of
company
credit
cards
to
the
extent
of
about
$27,000.
that
appears
in
the
record
and
that
it
--
and
it
was
at
--
it
was
at
that
point
that
they
first
went
into
the
leasing
arrangements
which
were
held
by
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
to
be
contract
carriage
on
the
part
of
the
owner-operators,
and
that
in
turn
apparently
led
to
the
draft
of
the
second
set
of
contracts
which
is
involved
in
this
case
and
which
are
still
on
effect.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
if
you
or
i
go
to
one
of
these
big
truck
rental
companies,
they
will
not
rent
to
us,
a
big
truck
tractor
on
just
so
much
per
mile,
because
for
all
they
know,
we
may
have
it
sitting
around
our
yard
two-thirds
of
the
time.
they
will
insist
upon
a
certain
minimum
or
overhead
amount,
plus
the
mileage.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh
no,
not
legally
require
it.
it's
the
only
way
they
can
--
it's
the
only
way
where
they
can
survive
financially.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly,
but
do
we
--
well,
but
we
would
have
no
basis
for
complaining
there
because
in
that
situation,
the
shipper
is
getting
these
ingredients
from
separate
sources
and
he's
putting
them
together
himself.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
if
he's
able
to
get
them
on
such
a
basis
that
he
can
end
up
with
a
known
predictable
mileage
cost
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
that's
where
--
as
a
practical
matter
sir,
that's
how
these
cases
and
these
problems
arise
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
case
after
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
they
might
be
employees
for
some
purposes,
perhaps
for
the
social
security
act
or
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
that's
the
practical
thing
we
had
again
and
again
in
enforcement.
and
as
here,
the
--
with
the
shipper
trying
to
--
trying
to
get
it
on
something
like
a
mileage
cost
with
the
risks
being
taken
by
the
owner-operators.
now
this
court
can't
solve
all
the
problems
of
transportation
in
this
case,
but
it
can
solve
one
big
one,
by
drawing
a
realistic
and
practical
line
between
bona
fide
private
carriage
and
by
--
and
the
for
hire
transportation
which
increasingly
has
been
carried
on
under
a
variety
of
leasing
arrangements
suggested
by
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
objectively
as
we
can.
we
do
not
claim
to
be
infallible.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
mean,
bona
fide
in
this
--
in
a
genuine
economic
sense
of
assuming
the
risks
of
providing
a
transportation
service
and
i
should
defer
the
rest
of
my
time
to
mr.
rice
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
have
no
allusion
that
in
this
or
any
other
litigation,
are
we
going
to
put
an
end
to
the
tough
borderline
cases.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
your
honor
suggested
the
problems
we
frequently
have
are
under
the
tax
loss,
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
have
nothing
more
to
add
unless
the
court
has
some
questions.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there's
a
statement
in
the
commission's
report
which
if
it's
taken
as
a
generality,
it
means
that.
i'm
sure
it's
not
--
that
then
applies
in
the
setting
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
do
not
contend
that
a
private
--
a
man
--
that
a
shipper
cannot
be
a
private
carrier
if
he
uses
equipment.
many
and
--
many
private
shippers
lease
equipment
from
this
equipment
rental
firms
every
day.
we
do
not
contend
that
a
private
carrier
must
own
the
equipment
which
he
used.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
the
owner
--
if
the
owner
is
the
driver
and
the
arrangements
are
such
that
he
is
taking
the
economic
risks
of
providing
transportation
then
we
say
what
is
involved
is
private
carriage.
now,
of
course
that
can
be
avoided
as
--
by
the
shipper.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
shipper
can
avoid
that
by
doing
two
things,
by
making
the
truck
his
own,
by
buying
and
paying
for
exclusive
possession
the
way
he
does
if
he
goes
to
a
rental
company,
and
by
making
that
driver
his
employee
as
oklahoma
does
with
the
six
drivers
for
the
six
tractors
which
it
owns.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
and
i
say
that
he
shouldn't
--
the
shipper
should
make
the
vehicle
his
own
either
by
owning
it
or
by
a
lease
in
which
he
pays
for
exclusive
possession
instead
of
a
doctrine
unlike
this
but
there's
nothing
more
than
a
30-day
option.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
on
the
leasing
rules,
no
sir,
i'm
not.
but
again,
the
keyword
in
there
is
possession,
effective
possession
of
the
equipment,
not
simply
on
a
30-day
option
on
which
the
shipper
has
no
real
purpose.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
to
me
it's
just
an
indication
that
the
shipper
is
not
paying
anything
for
effective
possession
of
equipment
as
he
pays
a
minimum
when
he
really
rents
it
from
an
equipment
rental
company.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
not
--
it
is
--
that's
a
question
that's
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
i
don't
have
it
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
we
could
start
the
preceding
sentence
at
the
bottom
page
163.
it
says
that
means
plainly
and
simply
that
no
owner-operator
can
be
employed
by
a
common
carrier,
a
common
truck
carrier,
or
by
a
private
carrier
if
he
rents
and
drives
his
own
equipment
unless
of
course
he
has
a
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
which
is
the
approach
we
find
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
silk
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that's
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that
status
could
vary
from
one
act
to
another.
we
say
silk
gives
us
a
valid
approach
and
that
--
in
that
we
are
to
look
at
the
entire
situation,
all
of
the
facts
including
the
factor
who
is
assuming
the
risk.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
one
of
the
two
aspects
of
the
commission's
decision
both
of
which
were
overruled
by
the
district
court.
thank
you.
