justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on,
mr.
ginnane,
you
pointed
out
one
inadequacy
from
your
point
of
view
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
namely,
that
sufficient
attention
wasnâ€™t
made
to
some
of
the
elements
of
control
other
than
mere
physical
control.
is
that
the
only
insufficiency
of
the
opinion
in
your
view
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
after
they
review,
not
any
legal
deductions,
but
in
their
review
of
the
basis
on
which
the
icc
ordered
what
it
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
alternative
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
test.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
only
--
the
only
inadequacy
in
considering
the
basis
on
which
the
icc
acts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginnane,
i
have
difficulty
or
a
greater
difficulty,
namely
here
the
statute
which
puts
contract
carriers
within
the
regulatory
power
of
the
commission
and
the
shipper's
transportation
facilities
private
carriers
out
of
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
surely
here,
the
icc
can
say
in
this
case
it
would
hold
it's
a
private
one,
the
next
case
we
hold
it
it's
contract
carrier,
just
capriciously,
can
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
with
my
difficulty
is
we've
got
a
problem
of
judicial
review
here.
and
if
it's
really
an
ad
hoc
determination
in
each
case,
what's
the
basis
on
which
a
district
court
upsets
the
determination
of
the
icc?
i
can
see
if
it's
a
so-called
a
fact
question,
we
can
draw
on
the
general
consideration,
there
must
be
some
basis.
it
can't
be
just
capricious.
it
can't
be
drawn
out
of
the
blue,
but
if
it
is
a
--
or
shall
i
say
a
circumstantial
a
matter,
the
variations
of
various
diversities
in
the
permutations
and
combinations
of
differences
in
items,
then
we've
got
a
problem
on
businesses
of
the
district
court
to
overturn.
there
must
be
some
guiding
basis
on
which
it
can
say
the
order
shouldn't
stand,
it
can't
just
say,
the
order
shouldn't
stand
because
we
as
determiners
of
the
fact
to
decide
differently.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
can
do
so
if
there's
no
basis
for
the
finding
of
the
commission
the
other
way.
if
there's
a
contested
cont
--
if
there
is
a
contest
on
what
can
be
found
then
certainly
the
district
court
must
follow
to
the
finding
of
the
commission
and
we've
got
a
problem
what
our
scope
of
review
is.
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
it
can't
be
left
at
large
to
say
each
case
is
a
case
by
itself.
it
must
be
a
case
by
itself
with
reference
to
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginnane,
while
we're
on
that
point,
may
i
ask
you,
sir,
if
these
men
are
not
truly
employees
of
oklahoma,
then
have
they
any
right
to
bargain
collectively
with
it
under
the
labor
acts
and
would
not
it
be
a
violation
of
the
anti
trust
laws
for
a
conjures
of
independent
contractors
to
bargain
with
one
as
an
employer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
general
proposition,
isn't
it
true
that
conjures
of
independent
contractors
do
violate
the
antitrust
laws
if
they
seek
to
bargain
through
the
force
of
their
combined
weight
with
some
customer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
that
opinion
hold
that
those
people
were
employees?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
--
is
there
anything
in
the
record
or
arguable
from
the
record
which
would
explain
the
economic
impulse
to
this
kind
of
an
arrangement
as
against
a
garden
variety
of
the
private
carriers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
bona
fide,
you
mean
objectively
determinable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
you
--
when
you
introduced
the
word
bona
fide,
you're
going
to
make
a
question
of
motivation
as
you
call
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
shipper
may
sue
astuteness,
get
on
this
side
of
the
line
that
became
private
and
contract
carriage
as
much
so
as
a
taxpayer
can
get
on
this
side
of
a
tax
line
so
he
may
have
in
mind
the
difference
in
dollars
and
cents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
it's
important
in
view
of
the
fact
that
you
answered
justice
harlan
earlier,
there's
no
suggestion
on
the
part
of
the
--
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
this
is
a
cunning
device
to
get
--
to
find
a
loophole
in
the
law.
that
isn't
--
you
put
that
out
of
consideration.
you've
said
that
no
matter
how
bona
fide
an
arrangement
they
may
be,
there
is
a
line
to
be
drawn
legally
speaking
between
contract
and
private
carriers
and
that
line
must
be
observed
no
matter
what
--
high
minded
or
economically
justifying
purposes
there
may
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
to
get
--
to
become
more
particular
rather
than
these
large
considerations,
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
reply
to
justice
harlan.
if
i
did
not
misunderstand
his
question,
it
was,
what
difference
was
there
between
an
arrangement
which
concededly
was
that
of
a
private
carrier
--
carriage
and
this,
except
but
for
the
title
in
the
vehicle.
you
said
there
wasn't
any.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
asked
specifically
was
there
any
other
difference
except
the
change
in
the
title
of
the
vehicle
and
you
said
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
just
say
upkeep.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
legal
consequences
are
there
aren't
they
that
you've
just
answered
in
the
questions
put
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
derive
from
the
document
itself,
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
can
the
private
carrier
do
exclusive
carriage
for
a
particular
shipper?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
misspoke.
can
the
contract
carrier
hire
himself
exclusively
to
one
shipper?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
ownership
of
the
goods
on
the
return
isn't
very
relevant,
maybe
relevant
but
isn't
very
decisive,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
true
but
if
--
but
the
ownership
of
the
return
goods
is
immaterial
provided
that
he's
under
contract
to
ship
those
goods
though
--
for
the
same
person
for
whom
he
hauled
the
original.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
the
ground
of
the
decision.
that
isn't
--
that
isn't
what
i
read
from
the
report
of
the
commission.
that
last
--
that
that's
all
there
is
to
it
if
you
hired
the
driver.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
--
but
you
may
cross
the
line
quite
candidly
without
doing
any
subterfuge;
subterfuge
isn't
the
problem.
the
problem
is
whether
you
come
inside
or
outside
the
particular
line.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
make
them
outside
and
by
being
secure
as
the
newborn
baby.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
evasions
maybe
wrong
on
the
concept
that
you
have
to
have
a
palpable
paper
flimflam.
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
the
attendant
risks.
it
would
be
attendant
incident
of
the
risks
involved
in
the
utilization
of
that
equipment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
this
case
we
have
shown
and
the
record
shows
that
there
was
an
ordained
garden
of
varieties
private
carriage
here,
(inaudible)
the
company
found
(inaudible)
so
expensive
or
too
inconvenient
then
they
made
this
arrangement.
they
diverse
to
themselves
of
the
very
thing
that
you've
just
indicated,
namely
a
private
carriage
is
more
enterprising
and
more
effective
and
more
desirable
for
one
reason
or
another.
now,
the
unquestioned
private
carriers
that
there
was
in
this
case
by
the
oklahoma
company,
they
got
difficulties.
and
the
oklahoma
company
said
it
that
clear
cut
position
it
had
and
it
made
a
new
lease,
and
this
new
lease
came
under
the
scrutiny
of
the
commission
and
that's
why
we're
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
therefore
the
change
of
method
begets
some
legal
problems.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
all
you've
said
earlier
before
my
intervention
was
that
private
carriage
had
shown
its
superiority
in
this
case,
just
call
into
question
because
clear
cut
private
carriage,
they
got
difficulties
and
they
have
to
make
a
different
arrangement.
the
question
is
whether
it's
still
within
the
concept
of
the
statute
of
private
carriage
or
whether
it's
for
contract
carriage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
true
if
you
look
at
the
commission's
prima
facie,
at
least
that
isn't
--
you
may
be
right,
i'm
not
now
questioning
because
this
isn't
both
rolling
off
a
lot,
but
it
isn't
fair
to
bring
the
case
--
boil
the
case
down
to
that
fact
because
on
page
49
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
which
reads
the
commission's
report,
you'll
find
what
to
me
is
a
crucial
paragraph
of
that
--
of
the
commission's
report,
49
and
50.
in
which
it
enumerates
the
items
of
risk
that
remain
with
the
shipper
or
rather
the
items
of
risk
that
are
transferred
from
what
theretofore
only
on
the
shipper
when
he
had
a
private
carriage
and
now
belong
to
these
owner-operators.
now,
you
may
deal
with
them,
i'm
not
saying
you
can,
all
i'm
saying
that
the
case
doesn't
reduce
itself
with
the
simplicity
which
you
indicated
a
minute
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
you
reading
it
from
mr.
iden?
what's
the
--
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
i'm
--
what's
the
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
speculatively,
i
just
wonder
whether
you
would
quit
on
that
bare
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
advice
{attempt
to
laughter].
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that's
for
granted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
therefore
you
--
therefore
you
wouldn't
deny
from
oklahoma
--
only
of
oklahoma
law
which
is
one
of
the
most
ambiguous
branches
of
law
that
i
know
is
involved,
when
they
suffered
from
its
ambiguity,
but
you
wouldn't
deny
that
oklahoma
could
as
a
matter
of
court
law
owed
the
lessee
--
the
lessor
as
well
as
the
lessee
liable
for
injury
resulting.
you
wouldn't
deny
that
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
as
a
matter
of
tort
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
a
state
couldn't
as
a
matter
a
tort
law
say
this
is
so
dangerous
and
it's
potentially
dangerous
instrumentality
that
the
real
owner
is
to
be
held
liable
as
well
as
--
as
well
as
the
particular
driver?
i
can't
imagine
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
no.
i
said,
could
oklahoma,
as
a
matter
of
local
tort
law,
do
what
the
early
cases
at
the
time
45
years
ago
when
i
didn't
know
about
them,
make
all
sorts
of
ruling
--
holding
the
ultimate
owner
of
a
vehicle
liable
for
injury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
in
the
early
days
they
did
as
a
matter
of
fact.
there
was
a
writ
--
there
was
writ
who
wrote
a
--
who
summarized
all
the
cases
and
the
legal
conclusion
he
reached
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
it
all,
i'm
saying
is
the
possibility
of
tort
liability
is
rather
unlimited.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
have
said
he
need
not
do
that,
therefore,
you're
not
suggesting
the
commission
to
make
rulings
which
it
will
exert
pressure
on
a
shipper
in
doing
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
decisive
factor
in
this
case,
the
30-day
option
or
these
other
considerations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginnane,
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
to
turn
to
your
jurisdictional
statement
on
page
3
and
4,
where
you
stated
the
question
presented
on
the
basis
of
which
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
am
i
to
take
it
that
the
question
that
you
presented
to
this
court
in
this
jurisdiction
of
statement,
your
conception
of
what
the
decision,
what
the
order
of
the
commission
was
which
the
district
court
overruled?
