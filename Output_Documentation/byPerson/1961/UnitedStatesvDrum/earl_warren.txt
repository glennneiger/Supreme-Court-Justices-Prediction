chief

earl

well,
i
would
like
one
--
to
ask
you
one
question.
the
counsel
has
rather
simplified
his
argument
in
saying
that
the
commission
says
that
it's
a
--
it
can
be
a
private
operation
if
there
is
no
lease
of
automobiles,
but
there
are
the
trucks,
but
that
if
there
is,
it
must
be
a
contract
carrier
without
more.
now
is
that
the
position
of
the
commission?
