mr.
roland
rice
mr.
rice.
mr.
roland
rice
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
two
significant
elements
in
highway
transportation
are
the
vehicle
and
the
driver.
and
i
think
that
in
any
consideration
of
the
problem
here,
we
must
constantly
keep
that
in
mind.
the
control
test,
so-called
which
the
court
examined,
was
one
way
in
which
the
commission
looked
at
the
facts
before
it,
but
our
quarrel
with
the
court
is
that
it
relied
wholly
upon
the
control
test
and
did
not
look
at
the
second
test
or
the
second
body
of
facts
or
situations
which
was
before
the
commission,
namely,
what
has
been
called
the
risk
of
doing
business.
and
regardless
of
what
maybe
the
result
of
applying
the
control
test,
we
think
that
in
this
particular
situation,
the
risk
of
doing
business
test
is
finally
the
more
important
in
determining
the
status
of
these
owner-operators
here.
and
we
think
that
the
commission
really
relied
upon
that
evaluation
and
we
think
it
is
the
important
evaluation
to
be
borne
in
mind.
mr.
roland
rice
well,
i
think
there
is
no
difference
in
terms
of
service
received
by
the
company
and
the
company
got
transportation
service.
mr.
roland
rice
not
anything
basic
insofar
as
that
concept
of
risk
of
doing
business
is
concerned,
no
sir.
mr.
roland
rice
no.
we
think
that
there
are
in
this
connection
some
significant
facts
that
ought
again
to
be
emphasized,
one,
the
lessee,
oklahoma
furniture
had
imposed
upon
it
no
promise,
no
obligation
to
use
these
owner-operators
a
particular
mile,
nor
to
give
them
a
particular
volume
or
tonnage
of
traffic.
it
was
absolutely
none
guaranteed.
a
further
consideration
is
that
there
was
given
to
certain
employees
who
drove
the
owned
vehicles
of
oklahoma
furniture
company,
a
guarantee
of
six
hours
pay
per
work
--
per
work
day,
but
there
was
no
such
guarantee
through
the
owner-operators
so
that
if
the
regular
employees
report,
they
get
a
six-hour
pay
compensation,
but
if
the
owner-operators
report
and
don't
do
any
work,
they
won't
get
anything
at
all.
that
goes
it
seems
to
me,
to
constitute
a
very
important
fact
in
showing
that
the
real
risk
of
doing
business
here
is
upon
these
owner-operators.
now,
within
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy,
the
conference
which
i
represent
has
a
tremendous
stake
in
this
case
as
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
ginnane
yesterday
when
he
talked
about
the
economic
aspects
of
the
case.
those
objectives
in
this
policy
are
the
developing,
the
coordinating
and
the
preserving
of
a
national
transportation
system
adequate
for
the
needs
of
commerce
and
the
defense
of
the
united
states.
our
carriers,
our
general
commodity
carriers
are
a
part
of
that
system,
and
that
policy
indicates
clearly
that
the
commission
should
seek
to
develop
say
adequate
and
economically
sound
transportation
companies
as
parts
of
this
system.
it
is
our
view
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
threatens
the
achievement
of
these
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy
by
endangering
the
traffic
which
our
people
normally
might
get.
from
the
very
fact
that
whether
the
intervener
is
here,
supports
our
view
in
this
regard
because
they
too
have
desirable
traffic
which
if
this
type
of
arrangement
is
proper
can
be
channeled
away
from
the
regulated
carrier
whether
it's
common
contract
or
for
that
matter
whether
it
is
the
common
carrier
railroad
system
of
the
country.
this
effort,
we
think,
is
merely
symptomatic
of
a
problem
in
several
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
if
you
would
take
a
look
at
the
stickle
case
which
is
in
the
tenth
circuit
court,
you
will
find
that
a
lumber,
an
important
commodity,
is
there
involved.
in
pickard,
which
came
from
the
western
district
of
new
york,
we'll
find
that
furniture
is
involved.
in
the
lamb
case
which
again
came
from
the
tenth
circuit,
we
will
find
that
wheat
was
moved
by
a
somewhat
similar
device
in
one
direction
and
groceries
in
the
opposite
direction.
in
the
la
tuff
case,
we
will
find
that
air
cooling
equipment
was
moved
and
also
furnace
fittings.
we're
really
talking
here
about
very
significant
and
important
traffic,
so
that
what
is
to
be
preserved
in
promoting
this
national
transportation
system
is
tremendously
important
in
terms
of
economics
and
traffic.
mr.
roland
rice
well,
perhaps
i
didn't
catch
the
whole
import
of
his
question.
of
course,
what
did
happen
there,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
i
hasten
to
correct
myself
if
i
didn't
properly
construe
the
question
is
this,
that
by
this
change,
the
company,
oklahoma
furniture
company
was
relieved
of
the
risk
of
doing
business
itself
and
i
certainly
wanted
to
be
understood
that
way
and
these
risks
of
doing
business,
we
believe
--
mr.
roland
rice
well,
i
possibly
misunderstood
the
question,
your
honor,
and
i
want
to
modify
and
correct
my
answer
by
what
i
said
in
response
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
insofar
as
the
service
is
concerned,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
real
difference.
mr.
roland
rice
oh,
the
risks
of
making
the
transportation
fail.
in
the
first
place,
the
company
did
not
have
to
buy
the
vehicles
and
then
there
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it
would
be
an
economic
enterprise
to
have
the
company
hold
these
vehicles
when
the
vehicles
were
not
actually
being
used.
now,
that
risk
of
making
money
on
those
vehicles
and
to
be
able
to
replace
the
vehicles
upon
their
being
worn
out
depends
upon
how
much
the
vehicles
are
used
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
roland
rice
you
have
--
mr.
roland
rice
those
things
would
have
to
be
done
by
somebody.
of
course
in
this
instance
--
mr.
roland
rice
that's
right
and
then
there
are
these
elements
to
be
considered.
there
is
maintenance
of
these
vehicles
and
this
--
mr.
roland
rice
pardon
me?
mr.
roland
rice
upkeep.
gas
and
oil
and
the
non-use
and
if
i
misunderstood
the
question,
i
do
want
to
add
that
these
things
would
have
to
be
done
if
these
vehicles
were
the
vehicles
of
oklahoma
furniture
company,
all
the
maintenance
and
the
repair,
and
the
furnishing
of
gas,
oil
and
so
on,
would
have
to
be
borne
by
oklahoma
furniture,
but
as
soon
as
they
transferred
over
to
the
other
people,
all
these
costs,
not
just
the
risk
of
loss
or
gain
from
operation
but
these
costs
are
automatically
taken
away
from
oklahoma
furniture
and
put
over
upon
the
owner-operator.
mr.
roland
rice
that
might
be
very
considerable
--
mr.
roland
rice
--
very
considerable
difference.
well,
the
real
--
the
real
question
here,
your
honors,
as
we
see
it
is
whether
the
transportation
conducted
--
as
conducted
is
transportation
for
hire
or
private
transportation
and
an
important
consideration
here
as
is
seen
by
the
court
in
the
le
tuff
case
mentioned
in
our
brief
pages
18
and
thereafter,
that
is
a
decision
of
the
district
court
in
minnesota,
is
i
think
quite
relevant.
the
court
there
said,
where
one's
object
in
the
transportation
of
property
on
public
highways
is
to
earn
compensation
for
the
use
of
his
equipment
and
his
services,
he
cannot
evade
regulation
by
execution
of
the
lease
--
of
leases
or
other
agreements.
and
we
think
that
that
principle
is
applicable
here
as
it's
also
applicable
as
stated
by
the
court
in
the
b
&
c
truck
leasing
case
which
comes
from
the
tenth
circuit,
it's
a
1960
decision
and
which
we
rely
upon
in
our
brief,
and
which
says
that
where
--
well,
first
of
all
that
the
act
is
highly
remedial
in
nature.
and
that
it
should
be
liberally
construed,
and
that
its
terms
are
sufficiently
broad
to
reach
all
those
who
are
in
substance
engaged
in
the
business
of
transportation
and
it
is
our
assertion
here
that
these
carriers,
these
owner-operators
by
furnishing
both
the
vehicle
and
the
driver
service
are
engaged
in
the
substance
of
transportation
and
we
think
that
the
decision
of
the
court
in
that
case
is
right
in
holding
when
those
two
are
put
together.
as
they
say,
when
the
acts
of
all
are
linked
together
as
integrated
parts
of
procedure
through
which
property
is
transported
interstate
commerce
such
acts
themselves
become
unlawful.
thank
you
very
much.
