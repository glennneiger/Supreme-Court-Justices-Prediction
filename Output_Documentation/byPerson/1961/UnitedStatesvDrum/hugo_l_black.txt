justice

i
suppose
probably
the
risk
that
the
same
change
would
take
place
if
a
merchant
had
a
big
building,
and
he
was
bearing
--
paying
taxes,
keeping
it
up,
keeping
it
in
his
business.
he
transferred
the
title
to
somebody
else
who
had
to
do
those
things.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
some
loss
or
profit
is
going
to
come
out
of
it.
you're
saying
is
that,
as
i
gather
it,
that
oklahoma
furniture
company
gave
by
reason
of
this
device
to
take
no
risk
of
law
in
cases
of
loss
of
operating
--
operating,
it
is
the
same,
but
just
the
risk
of
profit
that
can
get
a
good
enough
contracts.
justice
hugo
l.

the
difference
in
renting
--
driving
himself
and
having
your
own
car
and
having
the
basic
cost
of
repairs,
isn't
it?

â€“-
justice
hugo
l.
black
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
there's
a
loss
from
the
failure
to
use,
who
bears
the
loss?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
truck.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
answered
that
they
do
not
hire
anybody
else,
of
course,
they'll
lose
the
money,
i
presume
that.
who
bears
that
loss?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
would
bear
it
if
the
owner
was
using
his
own
truck.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
say,
idle
half
of
the
time,
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
congress
had
some
way
to
settle
this
controversy
in
connection
with
agricultural?
i
recall
that
you
had
some
cases
in
florida.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
still
unregulated?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
asked.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
that
is
true
beyond
the
doubt
that
it
gets
the
near
bad
rating
of
a
car
to
carry
on
your
own
transportation
would
not
make
you
a
contract
carrier.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
question
with
all
of
your
familiarity
with
the
business,
this
is
the
reason
i'm
asking
you,
to
show
you,
it
will
be
easy
to
answer
it
with
your
knowledge.
as
i
understand
it
that
they
made
a
contract
here
for
so
much
per
miles
for
carrying
these
goods
to
the
oklahoma
furniture
carriers.
that's
right
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
to
be
carried
for
so
much
per
mile,
they
have
a
company
--
a
furnish
company
does
not
own
the
equipment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
own
the
trailers,
but
not
the
other
equipment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
in
that
contract
than
one
made
with
the
contract
carrier,
a
contract
--
in
a
frequent
con
--
on
frequently
contracts
made
with
the
contract
carrier
as
you've
carry
our
goods
for
so
much
per
mile,
and
that's
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
yes.
i
want
to
get
away
from
words
of
definition
and
labors.
what
is
the
difference
between
this
contract
and
the
contract
that
is,
permissibly
made
and
frequently
made
between
a
person
who
wants
his
goods
shipped
and
a
contract
carrier?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
care
what
he
is.
what
is
the
difference
between
the
contract
itself?
what
--
take
this
contract
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
with
the
contract
carrier.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
much
per
mile.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
can
be
done,
can
it
not,
as
a
method
of
payment
for
the
contract
carriers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
could
it
be
--
is
it
the
kind
of
contract
that
can
be
made
for
the
contract
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
is
there
any
difference
except
the
one
you've
mentioned
that
in
the
main,
the
contract
carrier
charged
so
much
of
a
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
oklahoma,
suppose
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
is
it
responsible
to
the
public?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that's
the
one
difference
there.
i
noticed
here
that
arkansas
has
held
that
--
now
has
it
held
that
the
contract
of
this
kind
of
carrier
that
carries
goods
under
contracts
of
this
kind,
must
get
a
license
in
arkansas
as
a
contract
carrier?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
agree
as
i
understand
it
with
the
statement
made
by
commissioner
webb
(inaudible)
on
page
a
164
which
says
this.
thus,
the
mere
status
of
owner-operator
lessor
is
said
automatically
to
defeat
lessee
control
irrespective
of
the
existence
of
convincing
facts
to
the
contrary.
i
understand
that
you're
saying
that
is
not
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
top
of
page
164.
it
merely
stated
the
owner-operator
lessor.
in
other
words,
the
driver
owns
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
operates
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
depend
on
other
circumstances,
as
i
understand
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
something
like
it's
quoted
in
the
next
quotation
by
mr.
webb
that
he
says
that
the
commission
did
not
say,
was
that
--
no
one
element
or
circumstances
in
(inaudible)
is
that
your
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
silk
case
is
a
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
use
the
silk
(inaudible)
case
(inaudible)
because
that's
under
another
act
and
that's
a
question
of
whether
he
was
an
employee,
an
independent
contractor
under
that
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
here
you
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
