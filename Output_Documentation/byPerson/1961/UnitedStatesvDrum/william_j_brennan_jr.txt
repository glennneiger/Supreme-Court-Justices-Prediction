the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ginnane,
in
--
isn't
there
some
element
of
combination?
isn't
there
effective
bargaining
agreement
involved
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
a
treat
in
this
individual
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
position
doesn't
depend,
as
i
understand
it,
on
whether
or
not
these
owner
drivers
are
employees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
your
point
is
that
the
combination
always
goes
with
this
arrangement,
that
is
driving
services
and
the
vehicle
owned
by
the
drivers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
side
are
you
on
here?
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
quite
understand,
would
you
sustain
the
commission
in
the
oklahoma
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
perhaps
i
should
ask
you
is,
does
the
pattern
in
the
oklahoma
case
fit
the
advice
you
gave
your
clients?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
haven't
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
maybe
i
misunderstood
you,
but
in
oklahoma,
they
do
bring
raw
materials
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
you
think
is
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
tell
your
client
is
they
can't
bring
something
back
to
somebody
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
your
point
if
i
understand
it
is
that
if
one
of
these
private
carriers
begins
bringing
stuff
back
for
somebody
else,
he
may
get
himself
in
the
situation
where
he
has
to
be
certificated
as
a
contract
carrier,
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
you
mean
is
that
so
much
per
piece,
so
much
per
ton,
so
much
for
something,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
rather
than
as
here
on
a
mileage
basis.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
contract
is
complied
with.
you
said
what
is
involved
is
private
carrier
(inaudible)
