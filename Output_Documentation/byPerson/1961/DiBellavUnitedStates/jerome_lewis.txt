mr.
jerome
lewis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
search
and
seizure
case
which
is
before
this
court
on
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
the
lower
court
affirmed
an
order
of
the
district
court
which
denied
a
motion
to
suppress
which
had
been
made
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
indictment.
now,
every
search
and
seizure
case
is
decided
upon
its
own
particular
facts,
more
particularly,
the
total
atmosphere
of
the
case.
the
conduct
of
arresting
officer's
prior
to
and
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
must
be
taken
in
consideration
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
search.
now,
the
facts
in
our
case
are
rather
unusual.
originally,
an
application
for
a
search
warrant
was
denied.
the
petitioner
was
arrested
in
his
apartment
in
the
evening
on
a
five
months
old
invalid
warrant
of
arrest
and
then
a
search
was
conducted
as
an
instance
thereto.
the
court
below
--
mr.
jerome
lewis
that
the
complaint
did
not
state
sufficient
facts
to
constitute
probable
cause.
the
court
of
appeals
so-held
and
the
government
does
not
contest
it.
the
court
below
held
that
since
the
arresting
officer
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
narcotics
law,
therefore,
under
the
narcotic
control
act,
the
arrest
was
lawful
and
the
search,
as
an
incident
thereto,
was
reasonable.
however,
i
respectfully
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
be
affirmed,
the
narcotics
agents
can
largely
ignore
the
fourth
amendment.
they
can
enter
a
suspect's
home
irrespective
of
the
time
of
night
or
day
upon
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
a
suspect
had
committed
a
crime
no
matter
when
the
crime
was
committed.
in
our
particular
case,
it
was
six
months
before
the
arrest
was
made.
and,
in
the
absence
of
special
and
necessitous
circumstances,
to
whi
--
more
namely,
that
the
contraband
was
going
to
be
destroyed
or
that
the
suspect
was
fleeing
or
likely
to
flee
and
also
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that
this
was
a
private
dwelling
and
not
a
movable
vehicle.
and,
where
it
clearly
appears,
as
in
our
case,
that
the
narcotics
agents
had
more
than
ample
time
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,
six
months,
there
is
no
evidence
adduced
by
the
government
that
the
agents,
at
the
time
or
prior
to
the
arrest,
had
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
the
petitioner
was
committing
a
crime
nor
did
they
see
him
commit
a
crime.
this
would
permit,
in
effect,
the
arresting
officer
to
bypass
the
magistrate
to
become
the
judicial
officer,
the
arresting
officer,
and
the
one
conducting
the
search,
and
i
most
respectfully
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
would
be
a
dangerous
amalgamation
of
power.
now,
congress,
in
enacting
the
narcotic
control
act,
was
particularly
concerned
about
those
emergent
circumstances
where,
if
the
agent
had
to
obtain
a
warrant,
the
suspect
would
flee
or
the
contraband
would
be
destroyed.
and,
as
we
read
the
remarks
by
the
senators
and
the
congressmen
concerning
this
particular
bit
of
legislation
and
the
reports
of
the
various
committees,
that's
what
they
were
concerned
about.
they
didn't
want
to
put
the
narcotics
agents
in
a
select
class
above
and
distinct
and
apart
from
all
other
agents,
but
they
recognize
it
and
i
recognize
it,
too,
that
if
they
--
if
an
agent
had
to
go
to
a
magistrate
when
a
man
was
hawking
his
narcotics
on
the
street,
of
course,
it
would
be
absurd
and
ridiculous.
by
the
time
they
got
back,
the
narcotic
trafficker
would
disappear,
the
contraband
would
be
destroyed.
but,
it
is
only
in
those
emergent
circumstances
that
this
legislation
was
enacted.
those
circumstances
are
not
present
in
our
case.
we
have
a
very,
very
unusual
situation.
at
the
time
of
the
argument,
the
government
did
not
submit
one
affidavit
from
any
of
the
arresting
officers
to
justify
their
entrance
into
this
man's
apartment.
united
states
attorney,
the
assistant
did
submit
an
affidavit,
which
he
candidly
admit
it
was
based
upon
information
and
belief
in
which
he
says
"we
saw
the
man
seated
in
his
house
in
his
living
room
at
8:50
in
the
evening
and
we
went
inside
and
we
arrested
him
under
this
whole
invalid
warrant
and
then
we
conducted
a
search."
as
noted
by
judge
waterman
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
there
is
no
case
in
this
court
upholding
the
search
of
a
home
by
officers
having
neither
an
arrest
warrant
nor
a
search
warrant.
and,
in
the
roy
jones
case,
357
united
states,
the
government,
for
the
first
time,
contended
that
agents
had
authority
under
federal
law
to
enter
a
house,
make
an
arrest
based
upon
probable
cause,
and
then
to
seize
contraband
that
was
visible.
however,
this
court
said
these
contentions
would
confront
us
with
a
grave
constitutional
question,
namely,
whether
forceful
nighttime
entry
into
a
dwelling
to
arrest
a
person
reasonably
believed
to
be
within
there,
upon
probable
cause,
that
he
had
committed
a
felony
under
circumstances
where
no
reason
appears
why
arrest
--
an
arrest
warrant
could
not
have
been
obtained
is
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment.
however,
this
issue
was
not
determined
because,
from
the
testimony,
it
was
clearly
apparent
that
the
arrest
was
but
a
mere
pretext
to
make
the
search.
and
so,
in
our
case,
it
is
our
contention,
too,
that
this
whole
invalid
warrant
that
was
used
was
but
a
mere
pretext
to
make
the
search.
the
government
concedes,
in
its
brief,
that
the
petitioner
was
under
close
surveillance
immediately
proceeding,
during,
and
after
the
narcotics
transaction.
it
further
admits
in
its
brief
that,
no
doubt,
the
agents
did
controvert
a
search
of
the
premises
for
narcotics
as
an
incident
to
petitioner's
arrest
if
he
were
arrested
in
his
home.
this
man
was
under
surveillance
for
a
period
of
six
months.
the
agents
undoubtedly
could've
arrested
him
at
any
time
outside
of
his
dwelling,
but
they
knew
that
if
they
arrested
him
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
his
house,
they
could
not
go
into
his
apartment
and
make
a
search.
they
knew
they
could
not
obtain
a
search
warrant
because,
during
the
entire
five
months
period
that
they
have
the
invalid
warrant
of
arrest,
no
incriminating
factors
appeared.
now,
a
search
warrant
had
already
been
denied
by
the
united
states
commissioner.
so,
therefore,
they
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
they
said,
"well,
if
we're
going
to
make
the
search,
we're
going
to
use
this
warrant
that
we
have.
we're
going
to
go
into
the
apartment,
arrest
this
man
on
that
warrant,
and
then
we're
going
to
conduct
the
search."
and,
we
further
contend
that
a
warrant
with
arrest
is
no
different
than
arrest
under
a
warrant,
both
must
be
executed
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
and
the
six
months
waiting
period
is
not
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
of
course,
the
government
has
the
right
to
wait
for
certain
circumstance
to
develop
in
order
to
spring
the
trap,
as
we
said
in
the
robinowitz
case,
but
that
doesn't
give
them
the
right
to
wait
month
after
month
after
month
when
no
incriminating
factors
appear.
mr.
jerome
lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
lewis
i
submit
to
you,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
the
arrest
was
unlawful
because
it
was
a
stale
arrest
and,
therefore,
any
search
as
an
incident
to
an
unlawful
stale
arrest
is,
in
effect,
unlawful
and
not
permissible.
and,
that
is
what
judge
waterman
stated
in
his
opinion,
that
the
government
can't
wait
six
months
on
a
warrant
with
arrest
and
to
go
into
a
man's
home
and
then
make
an
arrest.
he
said
that
was
a
stale
arrest
and
an
unlawful
arrest
and
the
fact
that
you
can
have
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
a
crime
was
committed,
you
cannot
wait
indefinitely.
and,
my
research
and
judge
waterman's
research
also,
we
have
found
no
case
where
more
than
a
month
elapsed
that
an
arrest,
under
those
circumstances,
were
held
to
be
justifiable.
in
effect
--
in
fact,
most
of
the
cases
hold
that
the
government
cannot
hold
back
an
arrest
with
the
mere
expectation
and
hope
that,
certainly,
some
criminal
activities
may
come
into
the
--
come
into
being.
they
waited
six
months
here
and,
without
any
other
incriminating
factors,
they
went
into
this
man's
home.
now,
our
constitution
says
that
a
warrant
must
be
executed
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
we
submit,
a
warrant
with
arrest
is
in
the
same
category.
congress,
by
giving
the
agents
the
right
to
make
a
warrantless
arrest,
certainly
did
not
carve
out
by
statute
the
necessity
or
a
greater
liberality
than
tho
--
than
we
have
under
our
constitution
and
i
say
that,
if
under
a
warrant
of
arrest
an
execution
must
be
within
a
reasonable
time
and
six
months
is
not,
then
a
warrantless
arrest
falls
into
the
same
category
and
it,
therefore,
follows
that
since
this
arrest,
assuming
they
had
reasonable
grounds,
of
course
which
we
deny,
then
this
arrest
was
stale
and
unlawful
and
any
search
as
an
incident
to
a
stale
arrest
must
of
course,
therefore,
be
unlawful.
now,
it
is
our
further
contention
that
the
agents
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
petitioner.
back
in
october
1958,
agents
monaghan
and
costa
from
the
federal
narcotics
bureau
submitted
two
affidavits
in
support
of
their
application
for
a
search
warrant.
the
search
warrant
was
denied
by
the
united
states
commissioner.
in
monaghan's
affidavit,
he
said
that
he
met
one
panzarella
in
august
of
1958.
they
had
some
discussion
about
purchasing
narcotics.
panzarella
said,
"i'm
going
to
call
up
my
connection.
i'll
let
you
know."
he
made
a
phone
call,
came
back
to
monaghan,
they
went
from
manhattan
to
the
county
of
queens,
monaghan
saw
panzarella
go
into
a
green
chrysler
car
which
was
owned
by
the
petitioner,
pan
--
di
bella.
panzarella,
then,
emerged
from
the
car
and
gave
an
envelope
containing
heroin
to
the
agent.
the
same
process
was
repeated
in
september
of
1958
but
this
time,
in
addition,
panzarella
is
alleged
to
have
said
to
the
agent
"di
bella
is
my
source
of
supply."
now,
agent
costa
says
that
he
had
di
bella
under
observation.
he
saw
panzarella
enter
the
car.
he
didn't
see
anything
pass
between
the
two
of
them.
he
saw
them
in
the
car
and,
later,
he
saw
panzarella
leave
the
car
and
joined
agent
monaghan.
he
was
familiar
with
this
alleged
conversation
because
monaghan
told
him
that
panzarella
had
said
that
di
bella
was
his
source
of
supply.
now,
the
lower
court
held
that
probable
cause
existed
and
cited
the
jones
case,
the
cecil
jones
case
in
362
u.s.
now,
judge
waterman,
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
believed
that
the
facts
in
this
case
were
even
weaker
than
in
the
henry
case.
well,
he
stated
that,
in
the
jones
case,
the
officer,
a
detective
by
the
name
of
didone
stated
that
he
had
received
information
from
this
informer,
that
this
man
was
a
reliable
informant,
and
that
he
had
received
reliable
information
from
him
prior
thereto,
that
the
defendants
or
the
suspects
were
narcotic
addicts
and
that
the
detective
had
received
reliable
information
from
other
reliable
resources.
but,
in
our
case,
panzarella
was
not
a
reliable
informant.
he
had
never
given
information
to
the
federal
agents
before.
there
is
no
evidence
that
di
bella
was
a
narcotics
user
and
there
was
no
further
evidence
and
information
given
by
any
other
reliable
source
that
di
bella
was
involved
in
narcotics.
now,
if
i
remember
correctly,
in
the
cecil
jones
case,
it
was
said
that
of
all
the
detective
could
go
by
was
the
fact
that
he
had
been
told
that
the
informant
had
purchased
narcotics
from
the
defendant.
that
would
not
be
enough.
there
must
be
corroborating
factors
to
sustain
the
information
given
by
the
informant,
and
judge
waterman
argued
in
his
opinion
that
the
fact
that
two
men
are
seen
in
an
automobile
and
nothing
is
passed
between
the
two
of
them
is
not
the
same
type
of
corroboration
that
this
court
held
was
valid
in
the
cecil
jones
case.
and
so,
i
submit
to
your
honor,
assuming
arguendo
now
that
there
was
reasonable
for
grounds
for
this
agent
to
enter
a
man's
home
six
months
after
an
alleged
crime
had
been
committed,
in
the
absence
of
any
special
necessitous
circumstances,
just
merely
seeing
a
man
seated
in
his
living
room
not
knowing
that
he
had
contraband
there,
not
knowing
that
he
was
going
to
flee,
where
they
could've
arrested
him
at
any
time
they
wanted
but,
of
course,
knowing
that
if
they
arrested
him
outside
of
his
home,
they
couldn't
go
into
his
home
and
obtain
a
warrant,
where
the
facts
are
just
like
in
this
roy
jones
case
and
in
the
lefkowitz
case
that
they
were
using
it
merely
as
a
pretext.
they
didn't
want
to
arrest
this
man.
they
could've
done
it
at
any
time
they
wanted
to,
but
they
weren't
until
they
get
into
his
apartment
and
then
to
arrest
him
and
make
a
search
as
an
incident
thereto.
if
that
is
permitted,
i
will
say
--
i
say
most
deferentially
to
your
honors
that
a
narcotics
agent
will
never
have
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
he'll
never
have
to
obtain
a
warrant
of
arrest
because
an
arrest
under
probable
cause,
under
the
narcotics
control
act,
then
would
be
equivalent
to
a
general
search
warrant.
he
could
bypass
the
magistrate
with
impunity.
he
becomes
a
law
unto
himself.
he
can
enter
a
man's
home
any
time
that
he
wants,
no
matter
when
alleged
crime
was
committed
in
the
night,
2:00
in
the
morning,
rouse
him
out
of
bed
and
make
an
arrest
then
conduct
the
search.
certainly,
our
lawmakers
never
contemplated
that
when
they
enacted
the
narcotics
control
act
which
was
strictly
confined
to
those
emergent
circumstances
where
if
the
agents
didn't
act
with
dispatch
and
under
the
exigencies
that
existed,
why,
the
narcotic
trafficker
would
flee
or
the
contraband
would
be
destroyed.
and,
we
haven't
--
we
do
not
have
that
in
this
particular
case
and
i
say,
to
permit
such
unparalleled
power
to
be
given
to
narcotics
agents
would
be
a
dangerous
precedent
and
an
emasculation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
your
honors,
i
have
not
said
one
word
about
the
appeal
of
penalty
question.
i
believe
it's
not
properly
before
this
court
because
the
government
is
asking
affirmative
relief
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
directions
that
that
portion
of
it
be
reversed
consenting
the
appealability
of
the
order.
i
say
that,
since
the
government
wants
affirmative
relief,
they
should
have
cross-petitioned
for
that
relief,
and
i'm
not
arguing
at
this
time
but,
if
your
honors
believe
that
that
point
should
be
argued,
i
have
reserved
approximately
10
minutes
of
my
time
to
counter
any
arguments
by
the
prosecutor
--
by
the
government.
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
lewis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
listened
to
my
line
of
adversary,
i
believe
his
theory
would
amount
to
fragmentary
appeals.
that
one
part,
that
in
you're
going
to
ask
for
a
suppression
of
contrabands
and
you
also
ask
for
the
return,
let's
assume
that
there
are
papers
that
implicate
the
--
the
defendant
in
the
sale
of
narcotics.
now,
after
those
papers
in
which
you
ask
for
a
return,
you
can
then
have
a
divisiveness
and
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
upon
the
illegal
seizure
of
those
papers.
and
i
think
the
whole
question
here
is,
is
either
the
contraband
or
these
papers'
part
or
a
step
in
the
criminal
procedure
or
proceeding
or
is
it
not?
that
is
the
issue.
now,
back
in
1930,
judge
learned
hand
of
our
circuit,
in
an
appellate
case
said,
“we
hold
therefore
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
proceeding
which
determines
the
appealability
of
order
and
that
since
this
was
before
indictment,
we
have
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
that's
been
the
law
in
our
circuit
for
31
years.
and
as
i
point
out
in
my
appendix,
seven
other
circuits
agreed
with
judge
learned
hand.
there
are
seven
cases
in
this
court
which
more
or
less
adhere
to
the
same
philosophy,
an
addition
to
the
three
cases
that
judge
whittaker
--
mr.
justice
whittaker
mentioned
yesterday,
we
have
the
go-bart
case,
the
steel
case,
the
lockwood's
case,
and,
of
course,
the
more
recent
vintage,
the
carroll
case.
now,
in
the
carroll
case,
the
court
very
distinctly
stated,
earlier
cases
illustrated
sometimes
was
off
discussion
that
under
certain
conditions,
orders
for
the
suppression
or
return
of
illegally
seized
property
are
appealable
at
once
as
where
the
motion
is
made
prior
to
indictment.
now,
we
made
our
motion
prior
to
indictment.
and
as
to
this
divisiveness,
the
severance,
this
theory
of
fragmentary
appeal,
this
court
in
a
footnote,
i
think,
thoroughly
elucidated
the
concept
of
law
when
it
said,
“we
do
not
suggest
that
a
motion
made
under
rule
41
(e)
gains
or
loses
appealability
simply
upon
whether
it
has
return
or
suppression
or
both.
i
don't
think
this
court
in
the
carroll
case,
has
set
a
line
of
demarcation
between
a
return
or
a
suppression.
mr.
jerome
lewis
well
--
mr.
jerome
lewis
well,
i
--
i
would
say
this
to
your
honors,
that
the
difference
seemed
to
be
that
when
there
isn't
a
criminal
proceeding
pending,
is
in
the
nature
of
a
special
proceeding.
now
take
this
case
--
mr.
jerome
lewis
you
mean
an
indictment
has
been
filed,
your
honor?
mr.
jerome
lewis
well,
i
--
mr.
jerome
lewis
no.
if
the
motion
is
made
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
indictment,
it
is
appealable.
mr.
jerome
lewis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
lewis
well,
the
distinction
--
the
distinction
seems
to
be
drawn
in
--
in
the
go-bart
case,
because
once
a
commissioner
has
exhausted
his
jurisdiction,
there
is
nothing
pending.
the
--
mr.
jerome
lewis
except,
your
honor
that
the
indictment
may
never
come
down.
and
now,
let
me
give
you
a
practical
example
of
what
took
place
in
our
case.
when
i
made
my
motion
to
suppress
--
mr.
jerome
lewis
all
i
could
--
mr.
jerome
lewis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
lewis
may
i
please
your
honor,
as
i
said
that
the
theory
of
law
seems
to
be
that
once
a
commissioner
has
filed
them
in
over
for
the
grand
jury
and
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
indictment,
there
is
nothing
pending
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
now,
in
our
particular
case,
your
honor,
when
i
made
my
motion
to
suppress,
i
didn't
receive
a
criminal
number.
i
received
a
miscellaneous
number
and
i
had
to
pay
a
filing
fee.
now,
in
the
event
there
had
been
an
indictment,
i
would
have
received
a
criminal
number
and
not
pay
the
filing
fee
because
it
would
considered
as
part
of
the
criminal
proceeding
and
therefore
--
mr.
jerome
lewis
but
your
honor,
i
cannot
disagree
with
your
reasoning,
but
that's
what
the
courts
have
held
in
the
past.
mr.
jerome
lewis
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
mr.
jerome
lewis
i
said
either
both
are
appealable
or
none.either
is
part
of
a
criminal
proceeding
or
it
isn't.
you
can't
have
fragmentary
appeals
and
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
say,
“we're
only
going
to
take
one
portion
of
what
took
place
at
this
particular
time
and
we're
going
to
exclude
the
other.”
and
i
think
the
same
philosophical
reasoning
must
be,
either
they're
part
of
a
criminal
proceeding
as
a
step
or
they
are
not.
it
is
my
contention
that
when
there
is
no
indictment
pending,
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
special
proceeding
and
i
don't
care
what
received
or
whether
i
asked
for
the
return
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
meant
in
the
carroll
case.
now,
that
is
my
entire
concept
of
a
law
as
it
is
and
i
think
it
has
been
for
many,
many
years.
i
haven't
got
much
time
left.
we
haven't
had
too
much
of
a
discussion
from
the
government
on
the
merits,
and
i
think,
your
honors,
that
in
the
court
the
congress
never
contemplated
that
the
awesome
powers
that
the
agents
arrogated
to
themselves
in
this
particular
case
would
ever
be
used
by
them
in
the
manner
in
which
they
did
because
a
particularly
--
particular
significance
to
note
that
none
of
--
not
one
agent
ever
submitted
an
affidavit
as
to
what
took
place
prior
to
the
arrest
or
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
to
justify
what
they
did.
and
i'd
like
--
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
lower
law
of
court
should
be
reversed
and
i'd
like
to
conclude
with
a
very
pertinent
observation
made
by
judge
waterman
in
the
dissenting
opinion
when
he
said,
“to
approve
the
office's
acts
here,
is
to
take
another
long
step
away
from
the
original
concepts
of
oath
and
liberty
expressed
in
the
fourth
amendment.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
jerome
lewis
yes.
mr.
jerome
lewis
it
never
was
resolved.
may
i
say
this;
there
we
have
a
very
unusual
situation.
i
can
understand
the
use
of
hearsay
evidence
in
order
to
indicate
probable
cause.
but
we
haven't
got
an
affidavit
from
any
of
the
arresting
agents
in
this
case.
all
we
have
is
an
affidavit
of
an
--
the
united
states
attorney
who
says,
based
upon
information
and
belief.
now,
after
an
arrest
that
which
takes
place
is
evidentiary
in
nature.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
if
we
had
a
formal
hearing,
couldn't
take
the
stand
and
testify
as
to
what
he
was
told
and
that
is
the
entire
falsity
of
the
government's
argument
here.
we
haven't
got
an
affidavit
from
any
of
the
agents.
and
so,
the
only
thing
that
was
before
the
court
was
the
affidavit
of
the
petitioner
that
he
didn't
give
his
consent.
now,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
i
think
it's
a
--
a
very
unkind
of
procedure
for
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
to
submit
his
affidavit
as
to
what
he
was
told
by
an
agent
after
an
arrest
took
place
and
immediately
filed
thereto
without
an
affidavit
from
an
agent.
mr.
jerome
lewis
no,
your
honor,
because
i
say
that
issue
of
fact
never
has
arisen
because
the
government
did
not
submit
any
affidavit
by
any
of
the
agents
as
to
what
transpired.
and
even
--
even
assuming
arguendo
that
there
might
be,
of
course,
and
they
have
consent.
when
it
comes
to
the
question
of
consent,
then
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
clearly
and
unequivocally
that
a
man
waived
his
constitutional
right.
and
i
said
that
looking
at
the
record
here,
it
is
apparent
that
this
man
did
not
unequivocally
waive
his
constitutional
rights.
and
i
say
the
government
submitted
no
evidence
in
support
of
it.
you
can't
submit
an
affidavit
of
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
as
to
what
he
was
told
about
evidentiary
facts.
you
can
under
the
(inaudible)
case,
do
it
to
establish
probable
cause
but
you
can't
do
it
to
establish
that
arrest
was
legal
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
arrest.
and
i
say
there
was
no
factual
issue
presented
to
the
trial
court
with
determination.
are
there
any
other
questions?
i
know
it
sounded
too
light.
mr.
jerome
lewis
thank
you
your
honor.
