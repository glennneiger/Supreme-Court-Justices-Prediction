mr.
lewis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
invalidity
of
the
warrant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
in
this
case,
i
understand
that,
on
the
search,
they
found
not
only
a
large
quantity
of
narcotics
but
they
also
found
a
sizeable
amount
of
money,
some-$6,000.
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
that
true?
now,
let's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i'm
not
making
any
point
of
that.
i
just
want
to
get
your
differentiation
between
two
situations.
now,
suppose
the
government
--
suppose
the
petitioner
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
on
the
narcotics
and
a
motion
to
return
on
the
money
and
both
of
them
were
denied
by
the
district
court.
would
the
differentiation
which
you
have
made
entitle
him
to
appeal
on
the
money
order
and
not
appeal
on
the
other
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
suppose
you
didn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
make
the
dif
--
it
would've
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
not
on
the
suppression,
not
the
suppression
of
the
narcotics.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
--
maybe
i
don't
understand
the
facts
but,
here,
suppression
was
denied
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
would
you
say
that,
merely
because
there
was
money
involved
in
it
that
that
would
invol
--
would
entitle
him
to
appeal
from
the
order
denying
suppression?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
the
thing
that
bothers
me.
i
could
see
how
that
differentiation
could
be
made,
but
you
say
that
you
could
appeal
the
whole
thing
there.
now,
i
understand
that
your
position
here
is
that
he
can't
appeal
the
order
denying
suppression
because
it's
inseparable
from
the
criminal
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
money
could
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
know.
i
was
just
--
i'm
just
giving
you
a
hypothetical
case.
i
said
assuming
that
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
assuming
that
you
are
holding
both
and
he
could
get
neither
back
and
he
made
a
motion
to
suppress
the
narcotics
and
also
made
a
motion
for
the
return
of
the
money,
could
he
appeal
the
order
denying
him
return
of
the
money
but
not
appeal
the
order
denying
him
suppression
for
the
narcotics?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
was
your
argument
about
valuable
property
if
that's
the
only
issue?
and,
you
made
a
distinction
and
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
that.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
your
point
of
view.
you
said
something
about
if
there
was
valuable
property
and
the
motion
is
made
to
return
it,
there
would
be
a
different
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
try
to
put
into
this
case,
not
to
bind
you
but
to
get
your
reasoning,
the
fact
that
he
moves
to
--
for
return
of
his
money.
he
wants
to
use
it
and
he
also
makes
a
motion
for
suppression
of
the
evidence
of
the
narcotics,
and
i
want
to
know
if
he
can
appeal
one
and
not
the
other
or
if
he
can
appeal
both
or
if
he
can
appeal
neither
under
your
theory.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
rather
st
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
rather
stick
with
mine,
if
you
don't
mind.
then
you
propose
your
own
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
just
--
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
of
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
really,
i
don't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mario
dibella
versus
united
states.
mr.
terris,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
--
that
is
assuming,
of
course,
that
the
money
is
not
necessary
to
be
used
as
evidence.
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris,
according
to
your
thesis,
is
it
necessary
to
use
the
word
valuable
in
connection
with
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
just
isn't
--
isn't
the
word
“property”
sufficient
to
sustain
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
is
that
--
in
any
--
in
any
case,
if
it
was
disassociated
from
the
criminal
trial
and
it
was
property
of
the
person
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
person
that
would
--
we
don't
have
to
bother
about
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
valuable
part.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
take
the
property
that
is
not
de
minimis
he
said,
then
i
think
maybe
we
can
get
--
all
of
--
now,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question,
please.
do
make
any
distinction
between
the
post-indictment
and
--
and
pre-indictment
insofar
as
this
particular
issue
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lewis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lewis
may
i
ask
you
a
question
similar
to
the
one
i
asked
mr.
terris?
in
this
case
where
they
--
where
they
searched
the
premises
and
they
found
both
narcotics
and
money
and
took
--
took
both
under
--
under
their
search.
suppose
you
made
your
motion
to
--
for
a
return
of
--
of
both
the
--
or
suppression
of
the
narcotics
and
a
return
of
the
money.
the
court
denied
both
of
them.
do
you
appeal
from
that?and
suppose
we're
not
with
you
on
the
--
on
the
question
of
the
suppression
of
the
evidence.
we
believe
that
was
properly
suppressed.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
government
made
no
effort
at
all
to
show
that
the
money
was
anyway
connected
with
the
--
with
trial
or
it's
total
absence
of
proof
on
that
--
on
that
subject.
would
you
think
that
--
that
was
appealable?
that
portion
was
appealable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
would
you
insist
that
that
be
not
appealable
and
the
government
keep
your
money
all
the
time
you're
undergoing
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
think
not,
mr.
lewis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.

number
93,
united
states,
petitioner,
versus
daniel
j.
koenig.
mr.
terris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
take
another
extreme
of
that
--
that
though
mr.
terris,
if
the
government
seized
the
$20,000
and
then
just
put
it
in
a
safe
deposit
box
and
kept
it
there
for
five
or
six
months
then
the
man
came
in
and
says,
"i
want
my
money"
and
they
said,
“well,
we
won't
give
it
to
you”.
so
he
goes
in
and
--
and
makes
a
motion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
i
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
haven't
--i
haven't
quite
finished.
i
hadn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
finished
yet.
there's
no
claim
of
any
kind.
they
just
--
they
just
had
a
search
warrant,
went
in
and
--
and
got
the
--
got
the
money
and
--
and
put
it
in
a
safety
deposit
box
and
just
kept
it
there
for
five
or
six
months
with
no
criminal
action
of
any
--
any
kind
and
the
man
made
a
motion
for
--
for
a
return
of
it.
the
government
said,
“well,
we
--
we
don't
know
some
time
we
may
want
to
prosecute
this
man”
and
the
court
said,
“no,
you
can't
--
you
can't
hold
the
property
on
that
theory.
you've
got
to
return
it,
return
it
to
him”.
now
i
suppose
that
--
no,
no,
put
it
the
other
way,
suppose
the
court
said,
“alright,
you
may
keep
it,”
i
suppose
in
that
kind
of
a
case
he
could
appeal,
couldn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
kind
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
what
i
understood
you
--
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say.
so
that's
one
case
where
before
indictment,
if
you
want
to
use
that
term,
could
be
used
to
--
to
support
your
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
it
was
not
connected
with
a
criminal
--
criminal
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
proceedings
because
there
was
no
criminal
proceeding.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
you
may
mr.
--
mr.
manners.
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
telegraphic
warrant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
would
be
the
initiation
of
criminals
--
a
criminal
case,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
manners
may
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this?
who
are
you
arguing
with?
are
you
arguing
with
the
court
or
are
you
arguing
with
the
counsel
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
won
on
the
lower
court.
you
--
counsel
wants
you
to
win
here.
i
just
like
to
know,
who
are
you
arguing
with?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
want
to
talk
yourself
out
of
a
--
out
of
a
victory,
do
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well,
then
--
i
just
said
that
a
little
fatuously,
but
what
--
what
i
mean
is
this,
would
you
--
would
you
just
state
to
us
how
you
view
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
case
whether
you
agree
with
it
or
whether
you
don't
agree
with
it
so
far
as
your
own
case
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
if
we
agree
with
you
and
the
government
that
this
order
is
not
appealable
then
the
order
--
there's
nothing
else
before
us,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris.
