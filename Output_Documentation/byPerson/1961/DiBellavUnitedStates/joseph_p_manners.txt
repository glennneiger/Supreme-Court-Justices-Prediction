mr.
joseph
p.
manners
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
guess
the
respondent
in
this
case
enjoys
a
rather
unique
position
because
directly,
and
perhaps
to
some
extent,
directly
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
help
our
cause
before
this
court.
however,
i
am
now
justly
confused
and
i'm
not
going
to
rely
with
the
briefs
or
notes
any
further
and
just
pretend
them
back
down
the
lower
court's
arguing
the
same
point.
the
issue
was
then
and
i
hope
it
is
now
as
to
whether
or
not
an
order
relative
to
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence
which
was
filed
prior
to
the
return
over
the
indictment
and
in
the
district
different
from
the
district
of
trial
would
be
appealable.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
yes.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
alright.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
let
me
put
it
this
way,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
picture
if
you
will
members
of
this
honorable
court,
the
night
of
september
29th
at
7:10
pm
in
the
darkness
of
miami,
florida,
a
man
seated
in
his
living
room
with
his
immediate
family,
a
wife
and
two
children,
visiting
him
just
for
the
few
hours
to
watch
the
last
inning
of
i
believe
the
milwaukee
dodgers
and
milwaukee
braves
--
los
angeles
dodgers.
it's
the
crucial
game.
it's
the
last
game
of
the
season
to
determine
the
championship
of
the
national
league
who
is
to
play
in
the
world
series.
the
last
inning,
his
family
is
there
and
visiting
him
are
his
stepfather
and
his
mother,
when
a
knock
happens
on
the
door.
he
answers
the
door
walking
out
of
his
living
room
still
looking
at
the
television,
is
greeted
at
the
doorway
with
handcuffs
on
the
fbi,
“you're
under
arrest
for
a
bank
robbery”.
he
is
freighted
through
his
living
room,
through
his
family
into
the
kitchen
in
ordered
to
sit
down.
at
that
time,
may
it
please
this
court,
they
ran
into
the
front
door,
they
ran
into
the
back
door,
they
climbed
in
through
the
windows,
ten
agents
of
the
fbi.
this
man,
at
that
time,
i'm
sure
was
not
thinking.
is
this
a
civil
matter?
is
this
going
to
be
an
independent
action
when
i
file
to
take
back
whatever
they
find?
he
was
fighting
for
his
freedom
at
that
point
because
he's
been
in
handcuffs
and
chains
since
september
29th,
1959.
he
is
still
in
jail.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
before
--
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
before
that
time,
yes.
at
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
of
september
--
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
4
o'clock,
september
29th
in
the
afternoon
up
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio,
some
federal
agent,
fbi
had
sworn
out
a
complaint
before
a
proper
united
states'
commissioner.
that
was
teletyped
down
to
the
miami
office,
received
about
4
p.m.
that
was
the
first
legal
step
of
finding
the
defendant.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
a
telegraphic
warrant
was
received
by
the
miami
office
about
4
p.m.,
means
that
complaint
obviously
had
to
be
filed
between
3
or
maybe
2
p.m.
up
in
ohio.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
and
so
this
court
has
held
as
early
as
1894
in
post
versus
united
states.
this
court
has
gone
out
and
stated
that
the
start
of
a
criminal
action
is
very
apparent
when
an
indictment
is
returned
and
when
an
information
is
filed,
but
it
also
starts
at
the
very
least
when
a
commissioner's
warrant
is
issued.
now,
what
is
the
difference
of
a
cow
as
the
cow
here,
can
it
ever
become
a
bull?
now,
and
i
have
to
apologize
to
the
court.
i'm
talking
now
perhaps
in
a
lower
court
fashion,
but
i'm
greatly
concerned,
we
can't
be
playing
around
with
words
and
semantic
problems
of
--
of
any
sort
when
it
comes
to
something
as
fierce
as
this,
25
years
of
a
man's
freedom
at
stake.
my
client
isn't
concerned,
if
i
have
to
move
back
and
tell
him,
“well,
i'm
sorry,
this
is
not
a
criminal
case
our
fighting
to
stop
this
evidence
from
being
used
against
you.”
the
law
is
logical.
the
law
has
to
follow
from
the
statute
of
const
--
from
the
constitution.
there
must
be
some
reason
in
the
law.
it's
as
simple
as
that
and
when
it
comes
to
rights
of
appeals
which
are
not
inherent,
in
our
jurisprudence
none
whatsoever,
strictly
statutory
and
safely
guard
and
limit
it,
especially
when
it
comes
to
the
government,
we
must
follow
those
rules
of
law.
and
now
what
happens?
in
the
rights
to
appeal
by
the
government,
it's
extremely
limited
when
it
comes
to
a
criminal
case
under
title
18,
whatever
the
proper
number
may
be
and
this
court
is
familiar
with
it.
they
can
only
appeal
for
motions
to
dismiss
that
have
been
granted
against
them
or
for
judgments
in
arrest
of
judgment.
they
can't
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
which
is
the
vaguest
thing
any
defense
lawyer
this
client
has.
they
can't
appeal
from
that.
and
yet,
they
file
a
decision,
the
most
final
known
under
the
criminal
law.
but
under
title
28,
anyone
can
appeal
from
final
decisions
including
defendants
in
criminal
cases
but
not
the
government.
and
this
court
has
so
held
because
the
criminal
statutes
are
limiting
their
rights
to
appeal
when
it
comes
to
the
government.
now
--
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
yes.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
i
apologize
for
being
carried
away,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
please.
i'm
not
trying
to
argue
with
anyone.
it's
just
that
i'm
feeling
this
strongly.
i
am
now
left
without
a
brief
or
notes
to
argue
with
because
of
the
confusion
that
i've
heard
and
i
--
and
i
don't
know
why
in
that
sense
because
i'd
like
to
get
into
a
legal
argument
if
i
may,
but
i'm
now
--
i
don't
know
which
side
i'm
--
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
no,
sir,
your
honor.
no,
sir.
i'd
do
anything
to
keep
this
victory,
if
i
may.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
so
far
as
a
non-appealability
of
this
particular
order,
i'm
in
full
accord
--
almost
full
accord,
i
should
say
because
any
argument
that
will
convince
this
court
that
this
order
is
not
appealable
i
am
for
it.
i
don't
stress
as
much
and
i
didn't
make
a
mention
of
it
in
my
brief
about
the
distinguishing
as
to
property
rights.
this
didn't
impress
me
one
iota
and
if
this
court
would
ask
me
why
i
moved
for
the
return
of
the
evidence
on
that
particular
motion
to
suppress,
my
answer
in
a
very
candid
form
would
simply
be
that
rule
41
(e)
says
you
shall
move
for
the
return
of
the
evidence
and
suppression.
in
fact,
the
return
is
first.
i
was
leery
so
i
followed
the
criminal
rules
of
federal
--
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
for
fear
that
i
might
have
done
something
wrong
on
behalf
of
my
client
simple
--
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
well,
then
if
i
may
i
go
to
the
secondary
argument
if
the
court
please
and
that
is
whether
or
not
this
order
in
the
southern
district
of
miami
will
be
binding
that
trial
in
columbus,
ohio
which
i
hope
will
happen
in
the
near
future.
now,
here
in
this
regard
if
the
court
please,
the
government's
logic
which
follows
through
accordingly,
but
its
major
premise
uses
a
term
which
is
not,
i
feel,
applicable
to
the
criminal
law
and
that
is
--
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
the
government
opened
it,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
the
government
has
opened
the
question.
i
never
raised
it
once.
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
its
--
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
how
i
wish
you
weren't
then.
but
just
--
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'll
be
honest
with
you,
i'm
taking
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
view
on
this
really.
i
was
afraid
not
to
argue
the
point
because
it
had
been
raised
and
brought
and
suggested
by
the
government
here.
i'm
inclined
to
feel
the
trial
court
first
decide
that.
i'd
rather
hope
that
doesn't
have
to
but
i'm
being
very
candid
again.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
except
mr.
justice
stewart,
perhaps
i
wasn't
that
explicit.
i
only
raise
that
point
because
of
the
petitioner's
brief
in
this
case.
i
felt
that
the
only
issue
that
should
have
been
here
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
that
order
was
appealable.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
i'm
inclined
to
feel
that
way,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
really
am.
it
was
dictum
in
the
circuit
court,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
petitioner
stressed
that
for
the
simple
reason
he's
saying
that
if
it's
final,
now,
we
want
you
to
take
the
dibella
view
--
he
was
using
these
--
both
sides
of
that
sword
that
he
was
swinging
around
here
and
when
he
said
that,
of
course
i
had
to
say
something
and
we
have
an
argument
before
this
court
just
to
protect
our
rights.
but,
i
feel
like
i've
just
heard
now
mentioned
by
the
various
justices
that
this
court
should
only
consider
whether
or
not
that
order
is
appealable.
gentlemen
--
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
thank
you.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
oh
yes
sir.
the
law
in
this
regard
has
been
settled
for
a
long
time
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
has
said
in
a
few
limited
cases
that
are
on
this
point
that
whether
a
motion
is
independent
and
plenary
or
whether
it's
part
of
a
criminal
case,
not
trial
but
case,
would
depend
upon
it's
own
particular
characteristics.
now,
this
is
the
law
as
pronounced
by
this
bench.
and
this
is
the
law
that's
followed
by
every
circuit
in
this
land.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
no.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
i
do
not
disagree,
sir
if
i
may
continue?
the
only
disagreement
comes
in
when
this
court,
and
i
--
i
apologize
to
this
court,
i'm
not
trying
in
any
way
to
say
anything
to
disparage
you,
is
that
whenever
this
general
proposition
of
law
has
been
phrased
in
two
cases
in
particular,
the
cogen
and
the
carroll
case,
as
examples
of
the
idea
and
maybe
establishing
a
standard
arbitrarily
because
there's
never
any
rational
or
reasoning
for
it,
the
court
has
gone
on
to
say
in
its
dictum
that
as
an
example
of
this
is
where
a
motion
is
filed
prior
to
indictment
or
in
a
district
other
than
in
district
of
trial.
now,
we
have
disagreement
in
the
circuits.
the
second
circuit
follows
both
the
where
and
the
when
examples,
both
of
them.
the
fifth
circuit
uses
the
where
and
the
when
but
doesn't
it
establish
it
as
an
arbitrary
standard.
it
uses
as
one
of
the
practical
factors
to
be
considered,
that's
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
disagrees
with
this
court
as
establishing
a
standard
of
when.
they
don't
care
when
it's
filed.
it's
up
with
everything
else,
that's
the
fourth
circuit.
the
district
of
columbia
has
now
agreed
with
that
position
of
when,
in
other
words,
we
look
at
everything
to
see
when
it's
concerned
and
not
prior
to
an
indictment.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
there
is
uniformity
to
the
sense
of
dis
--
disagreement.
i'm
trying
to
make
it
brief,
mr.
justice
frankfurt
if
you
please?
the
majority
of
the
circuits
do
hold
that
as
to
prior
to
indictment
rule
or
standard
set,
they
follow
it
prior
to
indictment
is
appealable.
the
fifth
says
no,
the
fourth
says
no,
the
district
of
columbia
says
no.
the
second
circuit
not
only
says
no
to
that.
they
also
say
if
it's
in
a
district
other
than
the
district
of
trial
will
be
appealable.
that's
the
only
circuit
that
says
that.
the
fifth
disagrees
and
that's
about
generally
where
the
law
stands
today.
but
in
none
of
these
cases
if
your
honor
pleases
are
any
rational
or
reasoning.
all
the
circuit
court
cases
rely
on
cogen
and
carroll
and
the
wallace
&
tiernan
company
case
where
--
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
well,
the
rule
itself
says
that
the
motion
shall
be
filed
in
the
district
of
seizure
and
then
it
goes
on
and
reads
a
lot
and
in
the
last
line
of
that
paragraph
says
or
it
maybe
filed
in
the
district
of
trial.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
it
ruled
on
it.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
in
part.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
they
granted
it
in
part.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
i
would
say
that
that's
the
last
order
the
court
has
granted
or
rendered.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
will
render.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
i
feel
it
is
through
with
the
case.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
it's
a
judgment.
mr.
joseph
p.
manners
that
is
correct.
if
it
could
be
appealed
it
should
be
appealed
now,
but
mr.
justice
whittaker
if
i
may,
if
because
you
want
to
make
it
a
final
judgment
does
that
mean
that
all
final
judgments
are
appealable
because
they
are
final
judgments?
now,
the
term
final
judgment
is
used
under
title
28
of
the
rights
to
appeal
statute,
but
a
final
judgment
of
acquittal
is
a
final
judgment
as
such
and
yet
the
government
could
never
appeal
from
that
final
judgment
because
it's
found
under
title
18.
if
this
is
a
criminal
case
from
the
word
“go,”
whenever
it
is
a
criminal
case
and
this
motion
was
filed
pursuant
to
the
criminal
case,
if
this
court
please,
it
still
remains
a
part
of
the
criminal
case
considering
the
purpose
of
why
this
motion
was
filed
and
that
is
to
stop
that
evidence
from
going
in
to
find
this
man
guilty
to
give
him
25
years
for
an
alleged
bank
robbery.
now,
if
the
court
please,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
brought
it
up
earlier,
congress
feels
the
right
to
the
government
to
appeal
in
criminal
case
is
extremely
limited.
and
they
enacted
the
narcotics
control
act
in
1956
giving
the
right
to
the
government
to
appeal
in
narcotics
cases
on
motions
to
suppress.
why
because
congress
felt
and
still
does
believe
that
the
government
cannot
appeal
for
motions
granting
--
motions
to
suppress
from
what
is
granting
motions
to
suppress.
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
just
read
a
very
short
paragraph
from
the
congressional
record
of
the
senate,
april
30th,
1956
at
page
7284
wherein
senator
daniel
while
introducing
the
narcotics
control
act
bill
explained
why
he
thought
the
government
should
have
a
right
to
appeal
and
this
is
his
words
--
these
are
his
words.
“the
bill
would
give
the
government
the
right
to
appeal
from
lower
court
orders
suppressing
evidence
in
narcotics
cases.
the
subcommittee
found,
during
its
investigation,
that
the
liberal
grant
of
motions
to
suppress
the
evidence
has
lost
the
government
many
good
cases
against
flagrant
narcotic
violators.
the
government
now
has
no
right
of
appeal
if
it
believes
the
suppression
of
evidence
was
an
error.”
now,
congress
went
a
little
further
under
a
criminal
situation
and
said
when
it
comes
to
narcotics,
government,
you
may
appeal.
congress
is
of
the
belief
that
the
government
