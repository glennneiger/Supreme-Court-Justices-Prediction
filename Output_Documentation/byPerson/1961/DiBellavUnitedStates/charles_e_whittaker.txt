justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
an
issue
up
here?
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
the
arrest
warrant
invalid
for
defects
in
its
issuance.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
held
that
the
search
--
they
upheld
to
search
on
the
ground
that
there
was
probable
ca
--
the
arrest,
rather,
upon
the
ground
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
a
difference
if
the
motion
to
suppress
is
instituted,
filed
in
advance
of
indictment
over
the
situation
existing
when
it
filed
after
indictment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
isn't
it
rule
41
that
gives
the
person
from
whom
property
has
been
taken
the
right
to
institute
a
proceeding
in
a
federal
district
court
to
regain
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now,
haven't
we
held
in
the
cogen
case,
the
perlman
case,
and
the
burdeau
case
that
if
the
proceeding
is
instituted
in
advance
of
indictment,
it's
a
separate
suit
and
the
order
entered
in
that
suit
is
a
final
and
reputable
one?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
gentlemen,
may
i
ask
you
please.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understand
from
the
record
that
there
was
a
very
sharp
controversy
between
the
officers
and
petitioner
as
to
what
happened
in
his
apartment.
the
officers
contending
that
petitioner
consented
to
and
took
this
search
and
took
them
to
his
bedroom
and
to
this
bag
that
contained
the
contraband.
he
denies
that.
has
that
issue
of
fact
ever
been
resolved
in
any
place?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
even
if
you're
right
that
this
order
was
appealable,
would
not
that
factual
controversy
still
have
to
be
determined?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
manners,
may
i
ask
you
please?
under
rule
41
(e)
was
your
court,
the
florida
court
a
proper
forum
in
which
to
file
this
motion
to
suppress?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
it
was
a
proper
forum
in
which
to
file
this
proceeding,
i
assumed,
was
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
now,
the
court
ruled
on
all
the
relief
prayed,
didn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
granted
it
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
is
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
part.
is
there
any
further
order
to
be
made
by
that
court
or
is
that
the
only
judgment
it's
to
render?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
of
course,
it's
the
last
order
that
has
rendered
but
is
it
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
to
render
anymore?
is
it
through
with
the
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
is
it
a
judgment
of
that
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
it's
to
ever
be
appealed,
it
must
be
appealed
now,
then
isn't
it
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then
would
you
have
