where
are
you
quoting
from?
justice
potter
stewart
the
point
is
as
i
gather
that
if
the
motion
is
basically
a
replevin
action.
justice
potter
stewart
that
appealable.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
that's
basically
to
suppress
the
evidence
which
would
include
the
--
an
action
to
return
non-returnable
property.
it's
--
it's
only
defined
with
the
--
with
the
criminal
trial
itself
whether
or
not
the
indictment
has
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
been
brought.
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
replevin
action
or
reply.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
you
make
no
distinction
whether
the
motion
is
denied
or
granted?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
binding.
justice
potter
stewart
one
thing
i
have
in
my
mind
and
i
may
be
going
astray
but
the
--
quite
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
would
otherwise
be
an
appealable
order
in
a
--
the
--
the
right
of
the
government
to
appeal
on
a
criminal
case
is
very
much
circumscribed,
that
is
right
of
the
government
to
appeal
i
am
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
criminal
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
then
certainly
the
government
doesn't
have
a
right
of
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
as
part
of
the
criminal
case
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
as
to
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
just
talking
about
the
statute,
that's
what
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
section
of
stat
--
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
title
18.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
about
title
18,
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
criminal
appeals
act.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
18
u.s.c.
3731.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
--
it
might
if
it's
part
and
parcel
of
the
criminal
case.
i
--
i
guess
we're
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
also
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
had
this
kind
of
a
case,
the
--
the
events
that
potential
offense
was
counterfeiting
and
a
lot
of
money
has
been
seized
and
the
potential
defendant
as
moving
party
has
filed
a
motion
to
recover
the
money
claiming
that
it
wasn't
counterfeit
money
at
all.
it
was
considered
authentic
u.s.
treasury
money
and
of
course,
if
he
were
right
there
is
no
crime,
is
it
--
would
it
--
at
all
would've
been
committed
and
if
he
were
wrong,
it
would
be
contrabands
and
yet
this
would
be
the
issue
you
say
in
the
--
in
the
forthcoming
criminal
case.
what
would
the
story
be
there?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
came
and
said
this
$20,000
that
i
have
saved
out
of
my
hard
earned
savings
over
his
20-year
period.
justice
potter
stewart
we
could
assume
that's
the
only
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
issue,
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he's
not
entitled
to
it
if
he's
wrong
but
he's
certainly
--
is
clearly
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
also
assuming
--
let's
say
that
the
government
says,
â€œyes,
we
--"
justice
potter
stewart
"no,
i
guess
--"
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
have
to
give
it
back.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
contraband,
not
if
it's
counterfeit,
you
don't.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
you
couldn't
introduce
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
what
issues
can
be
raised
on
a
rule
41
motion?
first
of
all,
whether
or
not
it
was
illegally
seized,
unconstitutionally
seized.
justice
potter
stewart
but
secondly,
how
about
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
money
is
a
marked
money
or
whether
it's
--
it
would
be
completely
useless
in
any
--
in
any
criminal
--
any
conceivable
criminal
prosecution,
could
that
issue
be
tried?
justice
potter
stewart
the
government
doesn't
have
to
show
in
what
possible
way
it
would
be
as
--
it
was
evidence,
do
they
or
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
actually,
he
didn't
waive
the
right
to
it,
didn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
in
one
of
these
cases,
i
think
you
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they
were
not
entitled
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
would
be
a
possible
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
most
of
the
time.
justice
potter
stewart
you
agree
with
that
at
all
mr.
manners,
do
you?
you
--
you
--
it's
your
position
that
there
can't
be
a
new
ruling
at
the
trial.
that
the
trial
judge
will
be
bound
by
this
ruling,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understood
your
brief
and
i
probably
apparently
misunderstood
to
say
that
this
ruling
in
florida
will
be
completely
binding
on
the
judge
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
when
this
case
is
tried,
this
criminal
case
is
tried.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
in
order
to
consider
that
question
you
have
to
consider
the
nature
and
scope
and
effect
of
the
order.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
manners,
of
this
--
the
man
must
do
it,
what
you've
been
arguing
that
somewhere
in
here
isn't
the
--
isn't
there
a
copy
or
a
reference
to
what
the
teletype
said
that
was
sent
down
from
ohio
to
florida?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
i
remembered
seeing
it
somewhere
and
i
can't
find
it.
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
have
it,
but
i
thought
it
was
somewhere
--
but
i'm
now
just
seeing
this.
justice
potter
stewart
where
now
--
where
on
your
--
where,
in
the
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
where,
on
what
page?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
rule
41
is
one
of
that
rules
of
criminal
procedures.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
my
definition
is
in
a
criminal
case.
and
if
you're
in
a
criminal
case
then
you
come
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
for
the
government.
justice
potter
stewart
to
bring
an
ordinary
court
action,
i
suppose
that's
true.
