mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
claims
that
his
arrest
in
the
subsequent
search
and
seizure
were
invalid
because
they
were
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
government
has
two
answers
to
petitioner's
contention.
our
first
answer,
and
we
believe
it
is
conclusive,
is
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
which
denied
the
petitioner's
motion
to
suppress
is
not
appealable
and,
second,
we
believe
on
the
merits
that
the
arrest
search
and
seizure
under
the
applicable
decisions
of
this
court
were
valid.
i
intend,
first,
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
appealability.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
then
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
will
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
will,
your
honor.
i'm
going
to
deal
with,
first,
his
threshold
contention
that
we
cannot
raise
the
issue
of
appealability,
then
appealability,
and
then
the
substantive
issues
of
the
search
and
seizure
insofar
as
i
have
the
time
to
deal
with
several
contentions
which
the
petitioner
has
made
in
that
regard.
petitioner's
threshold
contention
is
that
the
government
can't
issue
--
can't
argue
in
this
court
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
was
appealable
--
was
not
appealable
because
the
government
did
not
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
his
reasoning
is
that
the
government
is,
in
effect,
seeking
to
overturn
a
portion
of
the
judgment
below,
that
portion
which
held
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
was
appealable
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and,
we
think
that
petitioner's
contention
in
this
regard
is
clearly
wrong
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
a
party
could
always
argue
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
which
the
case
is
or
of
any
court
below,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
can,
and
in
fact
they
must,
raise
questions
of
jurisdiction
on
their
own
motion
even
when
neither
party
raises
the
issue.
now,
none
of
these
cases
have
been
cited
by
the
government
in
its
brief
because
we
didn't
think
that
petitioner
would
even
contest
our
right
to
raise
the
issue
of
appealability
in
this
court.
perhaps,
the
leading
case
in
this
--
on
this
issue
is
railway
company
versus
swan
and
that's
in
111
united
states
379.
there,
the
court
states
that
"the
rule
springing
for
the
nature
and
limited
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
is
inflexible
and
without
exception
which
requires
this
court
of
its
own
motion
to
deny
its
own
jurisdiction
and,
in
the
exercise
of
its
appellate
power
that
of
all
other
courts
of
the
united
states
on
every
writ
of
error
or
appeal,
the
first
and
fundamental
question
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
quoting
from
railway
company
versus
swan,
your
honor,
at
111
united
states
379.
on
every
writ
of
error
or
appeal,
the
first
and
fundamental
question
is
that
of
jurisdiction,
first,
of
this
court
and
then
of
the
court
from
which
the
record
comes
and
it
--
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
question
of
appealability
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
jurisdictional
in
this
sense.
there
--
that,
in
the
sense
that
this
court
must
consider
on
its
own
motion
whether
the
case
was
appealable
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
series
of
cases,
in
stratton
versus
the
railway
company
in
282
united
states,
in
shanferoke
corporation
versus
westchester
corporation
in
293
u.s.,
in
the
storer
broadcasting
company
case
only
recently
in
351
united
states.
and,
therefore,
i'm
now
going
to
turn
to
the
substantive
issue
whether
the
district
court's
order
was
in
fact
appealable
and
the
government
submits
that
it
was
not.
the
petitioner
moved
to
suppress
in
any
criminal
proceeding
the
evidence
which
was
seized
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
we
emphasize
that
he
did
not
move,
even
incidentally,
for
the
return
of
any
property
which
was
seized.
the
motion
was
filed
by
the
petitioner
after
the
complaint
have
been
made
against
him,
after
he
was
arraigned,
waived
preliminary
examination,
released
on
bail,
and
bound
over
for
action
by
the
grand
jury.
the
motion
was
filed
before
indictment
but
the
district
court's
order
denying
the
motion
was
decided
after
the
indictment
had
been
returned.
we
believe
that,
in
these
circumstances,
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
was
part
of
the
criminal
case
and
that
it
was,
therefore,
interlocutory,
that
it
was
not
a
final
determination
of
an
independent
proceeding.
and,
therefore,
the
government
submits
that
the
order
was
not
appealable
under
28
u.s.c.
1291
which
gives
the
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
only
over
final
decisions
of
the
district
courts.
now,
it
might
appear
that
it
was
in
the
interest
of
the
prosecution
generally,
that
the
government
take
a
broad
view
of
appealability
for
an
appeal
before
trial
is
the
only
way
that
the
government
can
obtain
review
of
orders
deciding
motions
to
suppress.
if
an
order
granting
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
is
not
appealable
and
the
trial
court
does
not
overturn
this
order,
the
government
will
never
have
an
opportunity
to
obtain
appellate
review
since,
of
course,
if
the
defendant
is
acquitted
the
government
cannot
appeal.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
motion
to
suppress
is
denied,
if
the
trial
court
admits
the
evidence,
the
defendant
of
course
could
obtain
appellate
review
of
this
order
claiming
that
the
evidence
which
was
admitted
against
him
and
which
led,
in
part,
to
his
conviction
was
illegally
obtained.
nevertheless,
it
is
the
government's
position
that
it
is
in
the
interest
of
criminal
justice
that
appeal
be
allowed
only
from
orders
which,
in
a
realistic
and
practical
sense,
are
independent
of
the
main
criminal
case.
we
do
not
think
that
interlocutory
appeals,
either
by
the
government
or
by
defendants,
should
be
encouraged.
a
broad
rule,
we
think,
of
apealability
would
mean
a
considerable
delay
in
the
already
too
lengthy
time,
perhaps,
needed
to
try
criminal
cases
and
such
delay
would
seriously
interfere
with
the
proper
administration
of
criminal
justice.
we
think
it
is
clearly
of
great
importance
that
when
an
alleged
criminal
has
been
arrested
that
the
trial
be
conducted
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
events
on
which
the
allegations
are
based.
this
court
has
held
that
the
appeal
of
the
tentative
or
incomplete
decisions,
particularly
in
criminal
cases,
is
incompatible
with
the
fair
and
orderly
administration
of
justice.
in
the
cobbledick
case
in
309
united
states,
the
court
said
that
"congress,
from
the
very
beginning
has,
by
forbidding
piecemeal
disposition
on
appeal
of
what,
for
practical
purposes,
is
a
single
controversy,
set
itself
against
enfeebling
judicial
administration.
encouragement
of
delay
is
fatal
to
the
devin
--
to
the
vindication
of
the
criminal
law.
the
correctness
of
a
trial
court's
rejection,
even
of
a
constitutional
claim
made
by
the
accused
in
the
process
of
prosecution,
must
await
his
conviction
before
its
reconsideration
by
an
appellate
tribunal.
we
submit
that
this
standard
should
be
applied
in
determining
whether
an
order
deciding
a
motion
to
suppress
or
any
other
order,
for
that
matter,
is
--
as
the
cobbledick
case
states,
is
appealable.
it's
as
the
cobbledick
case
states,
whether
the
order
is,
for
practical
purposes,
part
of
the
criminal
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
think,
in
general,
there
is
no
difference,
your
honor.
we
think
there
may
be
a
situation
in
which
there
is
a
difference,
that
is
if
the
motion
seeks
to
return
a
valuable
property,
that
issue
might
be
con
--
in
fact,
we
are
willing
to
agree,
is
independent
of
the
criminal
case.
it
becomes
--
at
least,
if
it
comes
prior
to
the
complaint
and
arraignment,
if
it
comes
between
complaint
and
arraignment,
i
think
that's
debatable
whether
that's
part
of
the
criminal
case.
this
motion
doesn't
involve,
however,
any
valuable
property.
it
involves
narcotics
and
it
asked
only
for
suppression.
that's
the
only
relief
asked,
and
we
think
that
can't
have
any
separate
effect
from
the
criminal
case.
that
very
essence
goes
to
the
admission
of
evidence
at
a
criminal
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
should
--
i'd
like
to
deal
with
those
three
cases.
cogen
says,
and
we
admit,
that
the
dictum
in
cogen
is
contrary
to
the
government's
position.
it
is
dictum.
however,
it
is
not
the
issue
that
was
before
the
court
in
cogen.
there,
the
motion
was
after
indictment
and,
of
course,
both
of
them
--
both
petitioner
and
the
government
agree
that
if
this
motion
had
been
made
after
indictment
that
it
would
not
have
been
--
that
the
order
deciding
it
would
not
have
been
appealable.
now,
as
to
bur
--
the
burdeau
case,
there
was
no
discussion
there.
we
admit
that
that
is
contrary
to
the
government's
position
if
one
ignores
the
difference
between
motions
for
return
and
motions
for
suppression.
the
property
which
was
involved
in
that
case
were
papers
and
other
documents
which,
at
least
on
the
face
of
it,
were
of
value
to
the
defendant
and,
therefore,
we
would
agree
under
the
standard
we're
suggesting
in
this
case
to
the
court
that
that
motion
--
that
that
order
deciding
the
motion
was
appealable
prior
to
trial.
now,
as
to
perlman,
there,
too,
the
documents
--
there
were
documents
involved
but
it
w
--
but
that
decision
is,
to
some
extent
inconsistent
with
the
view
we
are
taking
since
it
is
admitted
--
it
was
admitted
in
perlman
that
movement
was
not
entitled
to
the
return
of
the
d
--
of
the
papers.
he
had
given
the
papers
to
the
court
to
be
impounded
--
in
a
civil
proceeding.
therefore,
his
motion
was,
in
essence,
a
motion
which
said
that
the
papers
couldn't
go
out
of
the
hands
of
the
court
in
the
civil
proceeding.
they
couldn't
be
used
by
the
government
but
we
think,
essentially,
what
was
decided
there
was
that
it
--
when
there's
a
motion
--
when
there
--
when
the
papers
involved
return
from
the
government,
the
government
has
no
right
to
the
papers,
but
a
motion
prior
to
indictment
is
appealable.
now,
we
also
admit
that
none
of
these
cases
really
draw
the
distinction
which
we
are
drawing
between
motions
to
return
as
to
papers
or
other
valuable
property
in
motions
asking
only
suppression.
this
distinction
has
not
been
in
the
cases.
it
was
left
open
in
the
carroll
case.
there's
a
footnote
in
the
carroll
case
saying
that
the
court
was
not
deciding
whether
there
was
a
distinction
between
motions
seeking
return
and
motions
merely
to
suppress.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
there
are
really
three
views.
the
second
circuit
view
and
it's
--
a
number
--
as
your
honor
points
out
it's
been
expressed
in
a
number
of
cases,
is
that
any
motion
prior
to
indictment,
the
order
deciding
that
motion
is
appealable.
now,
there
are
other
circuits,
including
the
district
of
columbia,
which
say
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
many
of
the
cases
has
already
been
an
indictment
by
the
time
the
motion
is
decided,
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
now,
the
second
position
is
that
that
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
i
think
of
o
--
there
may
be
another
circuit.
that
position
is
if
the
motion
is
prior
to
indictment
and
the
indictment
is
returned
before
the
motion
is
decided,
then
it
is
not
appealable
but,
if
the
indictment
is
not
returned
in
the
interim,
then
it
is
appealable.
now,
the
third
view
is
that
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
more
recently,
in
recent
cases
over
i
think
approximately
the
past
four
or
five
years,
and
that
is
that
any
motion
after
the
complaint
has
been
filed
and
there's
been
an
r
--
and
there's
been
preliminary
examination,
that
that
--
that
an
order
deciding
that
kind
of
a
motion
is
not
appealable,
so
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
take
it,
your
honor,
that
they
--
insofar
as
the
motion
relates
to
any
evidence
going
before
the
grand
jury,
that's
been
washed
out
by
the
indictment,
and
then
all
that's
left
is
whether
the
evidence
is
going
to
go
before
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
they
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
is
very
little
discussion
in
these
cases.
the
discussion
largely
hinges
on
just
citing
cogen,
the
dictum
in
cogen,
occasionally,
perlman
and
burdeau,
and
the
second
circuit
applies
the
dictum
in
cogen
literally
which
r
--
i
think
it
is
--
there
is
really
the
--
probably
the
most
fair
interpretation
of
this
single-phrased
dictum
in
cogen
and
they
say
any
motion
prior
to
indictment
is
appealable.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there's
a
disagreement
on
the
facts
of
whether
all
of
that
was
taken
by
search.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
allow
appeal
on
the
whole
thing.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
issues
would've
been
the
same
so
we'd
allow
appeal
on
the
whole
thing.
it'd
be
s
--
we
think
it
would
be
silly
to
cut
the
thing
in
--
the
motion
in
half
because
the
court
of
appeals'
determination
would
decide
the
whole
matter.
of
course,
we
might
--
if
he'd
sought
return
of
the
money,
it
may
well
be
that
we
would've
given
the
money
back
to
him.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
we
didn't
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
it
would've
been
appealable.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
our
view,
it
would've
been
appealable.
if
he
had
sought
return
of
the
money
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
whole
issue
could've
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
since
the
issues
would've
been
the
same.
we
would
not
have
cut
the
motion
in
half,
as
what
it
amounts
to.
we
would've
--
we
would
agree
that
the
whole
thing
would
be
appealed.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
it's
the
relief
he
seeks.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
the
relief
he
seeks.
he
asked
only
for
the
suppression
of
evidence
in
a
criminal
case.
that's
the
only
thing
he
wants.
he
wants
to
decide
an
issue
of
the
admission
of
evidence.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
a
criminal
--
an
issue
which
we
think
can't
be
separated
from
the
criminal
case.
now,
if
he
asked
for
the
return
of
money,
he's
a
--
this
is
the
standard
g
--
this
is
really
very
little
different
than
an
independent
lawsuit.
he
wants
his
money
back.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
he
didn't
ask
for
the
return.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
we
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
our
view
is
proper
judicial
administration
would
allow
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
perhaps,
it's
a
technic
--
it's
a
very
technical
matter
he
could
only
take
the
m
--
the
order
denying
return,
but
that
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
also
decide
the
suppression
issues.
so,
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
in
this
case,
it
would
not.
maybe
there's
some
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
sense
of
it
is
only
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
because,
under
--
the
issues
on
return
will
be
precisely
the
same
issues
as
the
issues
on
suppression.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
they
--
if
your
honor
thinks
that
the
technical
rules
of
appealability
should
overcome
what
we
think
is
a
prac
--
perhaps
a
more
practical
standard,
it
would
make
little
difference.
i
would
--
because
if
--
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
of
course
be
binding
on
the
order
for
suppression
anyway.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
view
we
are
taking
is
if
there
--
let's
assume
the
case
had
only
money
in
it,
just
the
money,
and
we've
asked
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
both
for
suppression
and
return.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
okay.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
by
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
by
the
rules
that
we
are
suggesting
to
the
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
would
say
that,
technically,
it
could
only
take
up
the
order
denying
return.
that
is
all.
now,
we
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we're
willing
--
what
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
thinks
that
we're
being
large-hearted
about
this
and,
perhaps,
we
are
and,
therefore,
this
rule
is
wrong.
we
think
that
if
the
issues
are
precisely
the
same
in
the
--
as
to
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
they're
not,
then
i
quite
cannot.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
there's
any
difference
in
the
issue,
then
we
cannot
take
up,
in
our
view,
the
order
denying
a
suppression.
but
if
the
issues
are
the
same,
we
think
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it
goes
up,
both
go
up
or
only
one
goes
up.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
going
to
be
binding
on
both.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
overnight,
i
have
rethought
the
colloquy
i
had
at
the
close
of
yesterday's
session
with
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
chief
justice
asked
what
the
government's
position
would
be
if
the
petitioner
asked
both
for
the
suppression
of
the
narcotics
and
for
the
return
of
the
money
instead
of
for
just
the
suppression
of
the
narcotics,
and
i
answered
that
both
would
be
appealable
since
the
issues
as
to
both
would
be
the
same
and
that
proper
judicial
administration
counseled
against
splitting
the
two
portions
of
the
motion.
on
reconsideration,
it
seems
to
me
that
my
answer
was
wrong.
while
in
this
case,
the
issues
as
to
the
narcotics
and
the
money
probably
would
be
identical
and
therefore,
could
be
decided
together.
this
would
not
be
true
probably
in
most
cases,
and
in
many
cases,
whether
the
issues
were
the
same,
within
--
within
in
itself
be
a
difficult
question
which
only
the
court
of
appeals
could
finally
determine.
and
therefore,
the
government
agrees
as
was
suggested
yesterday
that
each
part
of
the
motion
under
rule
41
should
be
treated
independently
and
tested
to
determine
whether
it
is
a
part
of
the
criminal
case
or
as
an
independent
proceeding,
and
this
means
returning
to
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
case,
that
the
part
of
the
motion
denying
the
return
of
the
money
would
be
appealable
by
the
portion
of
the
motion
denying
the
suppression
of
narcotics
would
not
be
appealable.
i
would
now
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
no.
i'm
assuming
there
that
--
that
it
was,
but
the
issue
of
appealability,
it
would
still
have
to
be
returned
if
it
were
--
if
it
were
illegally
seized
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
prior
to
trial.
so
that
issue
could
be
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
determination
prior
to
trial,
to
determine
whether
it
was
illegally
seized.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
cash
could
be
legitimately
seized
if
it's
the
fruits
of
the
crime,
but
it
--
but
if
it
were
illegally
seized,
then,
of
course,
he's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
entitled
to
return.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
narcotics.
even
if
he
asked
for
the
return
of
narcotics,
we
don't
think
it
would
have
made
any
difference
because
obviously,
he's
not
entitled
to
the
return.
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
well,
even
if
--
even
if
the
property
involved
is
of
the
kind
that
--
that
the
movement
is
entitled
to
the
return
if
he
ask
only
for
suppression
and
doesn't
ask
for
return,
then
we
think
it's
not
appealable.
if
it
--
if
it
is
of
the
kind
which
he
is
entitled
to
return
if
it's
illegally
seized,
then
--
then
it
would
be
appealed
when
he
asked
for
return
and
he's
not
entitled
to
it
clearly
on
the
face
of
it,
then
it's
not
appealable.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
it's
as
--
we
--
we
think
of
the
equivalent
of
just
asking
for
suppression.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that
--
that
would
of
course
would
be
the
issue
that
would
be
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
whether
it
was
illegally
seized.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
our
position
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh!
the
government
is
not
contending
for
a
rule
that
there
is
never
any
appealability
prior
to
trial.
that
we
admit
that
there
is
appealability
of
the
--
an
order,
either
granting
or
denying
a
motion
asking
for
the
return
of
valuable
property,
for
example,
assume
a
case
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
think
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
you
--
we
agree
with
the
--
our
basic
proposition
is
that
if
it's
part
of
the
criminal
trial,
then
it
is
not
appealable.
however,
when
you
ask
both
for
the
return
of
valuable
property
and
for
its
suppression,
the
suppression
part
is
part
of
the
criminal
trial.
but
when
you're
asking
for
the
return,
it
is
in
essence
like
a
lawsuit
between
the
--
between
the
private
individual
and
the
government
over
the
right
to
property.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
i'm
assuming
that
--
that
issue
is
in
--
is
in
contest;
the
issue
of
illegality.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
you
--
it
--
it
is
true
that
the
issue
of
illegality
relates
not
only
to
the
suppression,
that
it
relates
not
only
to
the
return,
but
to
the
suppression.
that
we
think
that
when
there
--
when
there's
an
issue
between
the
--
the
private
person
and
the
government
as
to
valuable
property
that
this
is
in
essence
independent
of
the
criminal
case,
even
though
the
criminal
case
may
have
a
light
issue
in
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
--
that's
--
it
belongs
to
him
and
he's
entitled
to
its
immediate
return,
and
to
his
--
his
immediate
possession.
for
example,
assume
that
there
wasn't
an
indictment.
that
all
--
all
there
was
is
an
arrest
and
a
seizure
of
--
of
large
sums
of
money
as
in
--
as
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
--
it's
related
to
the
prosecution.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
the
government
--
and
the
government
intends
to
--
to
introduce
it
when
and
if
it
brings
an
indictment.
it
doesn't
bring
an
indictment
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
the
private
person
wants
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
--
but
here,
a
man
is
being
deprived
of
a
--
of
an
extremely
valuable
property
right
and
we
think
he
shouldn't
have
to
wait
until
the
government
finally
tries
if
it
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
it
will
not
be
given
back
to
him
assuming
that
we
went
in
the
district
court
that
--
and
the
--
and
the
motion
to
return
is
denied,
then
it
will
be
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
if
he
decides
that
the
evidence
has
been
illegally
seized,
then
it
will
be
returned.
if
it
--
if
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
in
the
essence,
an
independent
action
between
the
--
the
government
and
the
private
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
person.
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
if
it's
both
he
can
--
and
if
--
and
if
it's
both
there's
a
--
very
well
be,
then
--
then
he's
entitled
to
appeal
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
as
to
--
without
confining
it
to
money.
if
it's
other
valuable
property,
we
agreed
that
it's
appealable.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
is,
narcotics
is
not
valuable
to
you.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
we
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
this
--
in
this
case,
your
honor,
it
is,
in
the
coney
case
the
--
the
issue
between
what
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
we
--
we
think
of
it
--
it's
--
it's
something
completely
minor.
let's
say
--
let's
say
a
copy
of
a
document.
we
think
even
though
he's
asking
for
the
return
of
that,
that
isn't
important
enough
to
make
--
to
make
it
independent
of
the
criminal
case,
because
we
think
what
he's
really
interested
in
there,
a
court
can
determine
whether
he's
really
interested
in
the
suppression.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
no.
but
we
think
--
we
think
that
the
caroll
case
and
cogen
together
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
decide
that
as
far
as
post
indictment
motions
are
concerned,
that
orders
deciding
them
are
not
appealable
either
by
the
government
or
by
the
defendant.
now,
caroll
has
some
suggestion
may
be
in
di
re
case
that
they
would
be
separate
enough
and
it
cites
the
(inaudible)
case,
court
of
appeals
decision,
but
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
but
except
for
an
--
in
rare
instances
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
they
would
be
defined,
we
don't
think
that
they
could
ever
be
appealable.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
we
think
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
your
heirloom
will
--
will
be
returned,
of
course,
after
the
trial.
the
only
issue
is
time
and
we
think
that
--
that
something
which
is
de
minimis
as
the
chief
justice
has
explained
it
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
then,
your
honor,
then
if
you
--
if
you
could
convince
the
district
court
that
you
had
--
that
you
had
a
real
interest
in
not
preventing
the
delay
of
the
return
of
your
property,
that's
all
we're
talking
about.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
if
he
claims
and
--
and
shows
that
he
does,
that
i
mean
--
i
suppose
he
can
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
--
no
we
wouldn't,
your
honor,
but
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
in
--
in
many
cases,
they
--
that
claim
can't
be
made.
it
can't
be
made
in
the
case
in
which
the
difference
between
the
government
and
the
movement
is
about
contraband.
it
can't
be
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
that's
a
very
frequent
case,
though.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
--
then
there's
another
kind
of
case
in
which
the
issue
whether
who's
property
is,
is
going
to
have
to
wait
to
the
--
to
await
their
trial.
that's
the
coney.
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
the
discussion
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
the
discussion
that
we're
having
isn't
crucial
to
dibella.
in
dibella,
we
all
were
concerned
with
here
is
the
motion
for
the
suppression
of
narcotics.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
--
i
don't
just
--
i
--
i
did
never
intend
to
distinguish
money
from
other
property.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
he
--
he
shows
that
and
he
shows
reasonable
ground
for
that
--
for
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
so
in
many
cases,
we
don't
think
he
can
show
it.
for
example,
the
moment
there
will
be
copies
of
documents,
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
we
don't
think
that
he
can
show
them.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
--
no,
your
honor.
(inaudible)
only
is
--
only
is
relevant
insofar
as
it
establishes
the
--
the
framework
for
how
this
issue
should
be
considered.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
you
honor,
the
--
of
course,
the
government
was
in
a
very
difficult
position.
there
isn't
--
there
isn't
--
that
there's
been
no
decision
as
far
as
we
know,
that
--
that
goes
as
far
as
denying
appeals
as
your
honor
suggested.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
we
think
this
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
we
think
we
have
a
logical
and
coherent
position.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
sole
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
government
can
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
district
court,
granting
the
respondent's
pre-indictment
motion
to
suppress
evidence,
when
the
order
is
entered
in
the
district
other
than
the
district
of
indictment
and
trial,
the
--
the
motion
both
for
the
suppression
of
evidence
and
for
the
return
of
the
property.
the
relevant
facts
are
the
respondent
was
arrested
by
fbi
agents
on
september
29th,
1959
in
miami,
florida
and
charged
with
the
robbery
of
a
federally
insured
bank
in
ohio,
approximately
a
month
earlier.
the
arrest
was
based
upon
a
warrant
which
was
issued
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio
which
was
later
found
to
be
invalid
and
on
information
known
to
the
arresting
officers
which
was
later
found
to
constitute
probable
cause.
incident
to
the
arrest,
the
respondent's
house
was
searched
and
large
sums
of
money
and
other
items
were
seized.
on
october
9th,
1959,
a
final
hearing
was
held
before
the
united
states
commissioner
in
the
southern
district
of
florida
on
the
ohio
complaint.
on
october
12,
3
days
later,
the
respondent
filed
a
motion
for
the
suppression
of
the
evidence
which
was
seized
and
for
its
return
in
the
southern
district
of
florida.
on
october
16th,
four
days
after
the
filing
of
the
motion,
an
indictment
was
returned
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio.
and
subsequently
on
december
18th,
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
florida
granted
the
respondent's
motion
to
suppress
the
materials
seized
as
evidence
on
the
ground
that
the
search
and
seizure
were
unreasonable,
even
though
that
the
officers
had
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest
but
denied
respondent's
motion
for
the
return
of
the
property.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
dismissed
the
government's
appeal
from
the
order
of
suppression
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
interlocutory
order
in
a
criminal
case.
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case,
the
government
contended
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
was
erroneous
and
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
was
appealable.
in
preparing
our
brief
in
the
dibella
case,
we
--
we
reevaluated
our
position
to
regard
to
the
appealability
of
orders
deciding
motions
to
suppress
generally
and
we've
concluded
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
this
case,
dismissing
the
government's
appeal
was
correct.
i
will
first
consider
the
order
of
the
district
court
as
if
it
had
been
made
in
the
district
of
indictment
and
trial
instead
of
in
the
district
of
seizure
which
turned
out
not
to
be
the
district
of
indictment
and
trial
and
will
contend
that
it
would
not
have
been
appealable
if
it
had
been
made
in
the
district
of
indictment
and
trial.
i
will
then
argue
that
it
makes
no
difference
that
the
order
was
entered
in
a
district
other
than
that
of
indictment
and
trial.
in
the
dibella
case,
i
indicate
and
i
repeat
now
that
we
think
none
of
the
older
cases,
in
the
perlman
case,
the
burdeau
case,
cogen,
go-bart
which
are
the
only
cases
which
even
bear
on
this
subject,
are
holdings
contrary
to
the
government's
position.
while
they
tend
against
the
government's
position
and
there's
very
little
at
any
discussion
in
these
cases,
we
do
not
think
that
they
are
controlling
in
view
of
the
court's
more
recent
decisions.
in
the
wallace
company
case
in
336
united
states,
this
court
stated
with
regard
to
appealability,
whether
a
motion
is
to
be
treated
as
independent
and
plenary
or
as
merely
a
procedural
step
in
a
pending
trial
must
be
determined
by
particular
circumstances.
we
think
this
indicates
that
no
mechanical
rule
should
be
applied
and
then
again
in
the
carroll
case,
which
is
the
most
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
this
area,
the
court
emphasized
in
considering
a
government
appeal
of
an
order
granting
a
motion
filed
--
granting
a
motion
to
suppress
filed
after
the
indictment
was
returned
unlike
here
in
the
dibella
where
motion
was
filed
before
indictment
that
fragmentary
appeals
are
not
favored
and
“the
delays
in
the
prosecution
of
criminal
cases
are
numerous
and
lengthy
enough
without
sanctioning
appeals
that
are
not
plainly
authorized
by
statute.”
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
precisely,
your
honor.
now,
that
--
that
statement
was
--
has
been
cited
--
the
state
--
the
statement
in
carroll
that
the
earlier
cases
decided
that
motions
made
before
indictment
are
--
are
appealable
and
motions
made
in
the
district
other
than
the
district
of
indictment
and
trial
are
appealable.
at
that
state
--
those
statements
have
been
cited
for
the
proposition
when
numerous
courts
of
appeals
and
in
--
and
in
dibella
case
by
the
petitioner
for
the
proposition
that
--
that
in
those
situations
that
the
appeal
is
automatically
allowed.
we
--
we
think
however,
that
the
court
in
--
in
carroll
did
not
decide
even
in
dictum
which
there
would
have
been
such
a
proposition.
it
merely
alluded
to
the
earlier
cases
and
did
not
have
to
consider
them
because
that
wasn't
the
issue
which
was
before
the
court.
the
principle
which
the
government
is
contending
for
in
both
dibella
and
in
this
case
is
that
orders
deciding
motions
under
rule
41
should
not
be
appealable
unless
they
decide
important
interest
of
the
movement
which
are
separate
from
the
criminal
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
--
that's
right
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
except
for
in
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
might
be
--
there
might
be
a
situation
in
which
it
would
be
different
if
the
effect
is
substantially
different.
for
example,
in
this
case
the
respondent
contends
that
the
effect
of
--
of
granting
a
motion
to
suppress
is
res
judicata,
he
doesn't
use
to
resist,
it
is
in
res
judicata
but
it's
binding.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
we
think
that
--
if
that
is
the
effect
then
it
must
be
a
final
order,
and
if
it's
a
final
order
then
the
government
can
appeal.
but
we
think
he
is
wrong
on
the
proposition
that
is
binding
or
res
judicata.
that
it
is
not
a
final
order
and
therefore
it
is
not
appealable.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
--
in
a
criminal
case
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
--
of
course
the
point
of
an
appeal
here
either
by
the
defendant
or
by
the
government
is
that
it's
not
a
part
of
the
criminal
case.
if
you
want
to
say
that
this
is
--
this
is
merely
a
motion
in
the
criminal
case
then
it's
not
appealable
by
either
side.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
government
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
have
a
right
of
appeal
if
you
consider
the
motion
as
part
of
the
criminal
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
it's
not
part
of
the
criminal
case,
then
the
government
comes
under
the
--
section
1291
to
the
same
extent
i
take
it
as
the
defendant.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
in
the
carroll
case
and
in
some
of
the
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
in
fact
in
this
case
below,
the
courts
have
indicated
that
--
that
government
appeals
are
perhaps
less
favored
than
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
our
position
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
our
--
our
position
is
that
the
government
and
the
defendant
had
--
have
a
--
have
basically
the
same
rights
of
appeal.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
28
u.s.c.
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
1291.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
3731,
you
mean
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
criminal
appeals
act?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
3731.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
bel
--
i
believe
its
set
out
in
a
footnote
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
--
in
this
case
that
--
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
we
--
the
government
concedes
that
--
that
it
doesn't
come
under
if
it's
part
of
the
criminal
case.
now,
there's
--
that
was
part
of
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
that
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
--
the
your
honor,
the
only
--
if
it's
in
the
criminal
case
then,
if
it
--
then
--
then
we
think
that
it
--
that
it's
not
appealable
--
(inaudible)
--
that's
the
whole
basis
of
our
argument.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
--
we
know
--
we
know
of
none.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
gives
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
--
yes,
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
if
the
--
if
the
district
court
in
the
dibella
case
has
decided
the
issue
the
other
way,
the
government
would've
--
would've
had
a
right
of
appeal
under
the
specific
provision
of
the
narcotics
act.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'd
like
now
to
consider
the
basic
principle
for
which
we've
argued
in
the
dibella
case
and
here
in
--
in
five
different
situations,
all
involving
pre-indictment
motions
to
suppress
and
or
seeking
the
return
of
the
property.
first,
we
have
the
situation
in
dibella
where
--
where
the
movement
asked
only
with
the
suppression
of
evidence.
we
think
that
there's
no
possible
way
that
that
kind
of
a
motion
could
be
independent
of
a
criminal
case.
the
second
situation
is
where
the
motion
asked
for
the
return
of
the
items
seized
but
the
property
is
contraband
so
he's
clearly
not
enti
--
so
that
moving
clearly
isn't
en
--
entitled
to
the
return.
so
that
in
this
case
too
we
think
that
the
motion
is
merely
one
for
suppression
even
though
it's
labeled
as
also
asking
for
return
and
the
motion
is
not
independent
of
the
criminal
case
no
matter
when
it
is
filed.
the
third
situation
is
where
the
motion
asked
for
the
return
of
property
which
may
or
may
not
be
returnable
to
the
movement
even
if
it
was
illegally
seized
depending
on
the
outcome
of
the
criminal
trial
and
i
like
to
give
an
example.
for
exa
--
the
--
the
issue
whether
the
property
involved
is
contraband
or
is
stolen
often
depends
on
the
outcome
of
the
criminal
trial
if
--
in
fact
that's
--
that's
the
situation
here.
the
money
which
was
seized,
the
government
contends
was
stolen
and
therefore
the
movement
isn't
entitled
--
the
respondent
isn't
entitled
to
it
--
to
the
return
of
this
money
even
assuming
that
it
was
illegally
seized.
so
there
too,
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
we
think
even
though
the
motion
asked
for
both
return
and
suppression,
it
is
an
--
is
in
essence
only
a
motion
asking
for
suppression
and
that
therefore
it
is
not
independent
of
the
criminal
case.
and
the
fourth
situation
is
where
the
motion
asked
both
for
suppression
and
return
but
the
movement
has
an
insubstantial
property
interest
in
the
materials
which
were
seized.
an
example
of
that
would
be
copies
of
documents
which
he
doesn't
--
with
--
in
which
he
has
the
original
documents.
there's
no
need
for
him
to
get
them
back
immediately.
of
course,
he
would
be
entitled
to
it
--
to
the
return
after
trial.
we
think
that
such
--
that
an
order
deciding
that
kind
of
a
motion
is
not
appealable
since
the
movement's
property
interest
is
so
unimportant
that
it
--
that
his
plea
for
return
does
not
make
that
portion
of
the
motion
an
independent
proceeding.
the
last
situation
is
where
the
movement
asked
prior
to
indictment
again
for
both
return
and
suppression
and
valuable
property
rights
are
involved.
now
in
our
brief,
we
suggested
that
that
kind
of
a
--
that
that
kind
of
a
motion
--
an
order
deciding
that
kind
of
a
motion
is
appealable
whenever
it
is
made
before
indictment.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that's
--
that's
--
in
our
views,
the
situation
where
you
cannot
appeal
because
he
is
not
entitled
to
return
prior
to
trial
even
if
his
motion
for
seeking
suppression
is
successful.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
--
his
plea
for
return
can't
possibly
be
given
to
him
prior
to
trial
because
that's
the
issue,
as
you
pointed
out,
which
would
be
tried
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
so
in
essence,
he's
asking
only
for
suppression.
he
is
clearly
not
entitled
to
return.
so
he
--
again
we
think
the
label
that
he
asked
for
return
is
not
important.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
he's
not
entitled
to
it
even
if
he's
right
as
to
the
illegal
seizure.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
anything
the
court
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
if
the
government
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
says
we
illegally
seized
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
we're
going
to
give
it
back
to
him.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
no
--
i
think
if
that
--
we're
not
--
will
not
know.
we
wouldn't
give
it
back
to
him
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
until
the
trial
but
i
--
but
we
couldn't
introduce
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
(voice

mr.
justice
stewart's
hypothetical
in
which
there
--
there
is
doubt
whether
the
money
is
counterfeit
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
or
real?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
this
is
real
money.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
that
--
that's
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
the
classic
situation
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
that
we're
trying
to
carve
out
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
so
that
we
don't
deny
an
appeal
in
that
situation.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
precisely,
your
honor.
that
--
that's
the
reason
that
we
--
that
we've
made
this
distinction.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
to
take
care
particularly
of
that
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
now
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
i
do
--
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
that
if
the
government
says
that
it
--
it's
keeping
it
for
trial,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
would
suppose
if
it's
so
obviously
has
nothing
to
--
some
of
the
things
in
the
clement
case,
for
example,
which
were
seized
toothpaste
and
things
like
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
--
there
are
some
things
i
suppose
that
--
that
couldn't
possibly
have
anything
to
do
with
criminal
case
and
i
suppose
that
maybe
it
would
be
appropriate
for
a
--
for
a
court
prior
to
trial
disable
--
unless
the
government
gives
some
indication
of
wha
--
what
it's
going
to
use
the
property
for
that
it
should
be
reached
out.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
i
should
--
i
think
that's
probably
so.
although,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
--
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
it
has
arisen.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
example
which
the
chief
justice
suggested,
the
government
in
its
briefs
in
these
two
cases
indicated
that
--
that
an
order
deciding
that
kind
of
a
motion
is
appealable
as
long
as
the
motion
is
made
before
indictment.
(inaudible)
--
i'd
like
to
suggest,
however,
to
the
court
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
a
different
rule.
it
--
it
would
make
the
--
the
crucial
date
in
that
kind
of
a
case
the
complaint
in
the
commitment
hearing.
it
--
it
would
--
the
fifth
circuit
thinks
that
that
is
the
start
of
the
criminal
case
for
these
purposes
and
that
the
kind
of
a
motion
which
the
chief
justice
suggested
is
appealable
only
if
it's
made
before
there's
been
any
start
really
to
the
criminal
proceeding.
i
now
like
to
turn
to
the
particular
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
--
it's
not
infrequent
however,
to
have
a
considerable
delay
not
--
not
so
often,
and
in
--
in
cases
of
this
type
and
in
tax
cases
where
there
--
where
there's
been
a
--
where
documents
are
at
issue
and
--
are
in
issue
may
too
maybe
valuable.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
we
don't
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
inconvenience
is
involved
here
but
in
--
and
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
its
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
our
view
though
in
the
--
in
this
hypothetical
which
the
chief
justice
suggested
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
i
would
like
to
make
the
point
that
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical,
we
think
that
there
--
if
the
--
there
the
order
refusing
the
motion
to
return
is
a
final
decision.
we
think
that
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
that
they're
--
that
we
are
--
that
we
are
denying
him
the
right
to
valuable
property.
now
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
because
its
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
a
--
that's
another
exception
which
of
course
we
recognize
to
the
kind
of
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
now,
turning
on
to
--
to
the
facts
of
this
case
in
applying
the
principles
which
i've
suggested,
the
motion
here
was
filed
after
the
complaint
in
the
commitment
hearing
but
before
indictment
and
had
asked
both
for
suppression
and
for
the
return
of
property
and
this
property
included
$14,000.
we
would
--
we
would
think
that
if
the
respondent
had
an
unchallenged
right
to
the
return
of
this
money
upon
a
finding
that
it
was
illegally
seized,
then
that
this
proceeding
would've
been
independent
of
a
criminal
case
and
the
defendant
would
have
been
entitled
to
ap
--
to
appeal
the
refusal
of
the
court
to
return
his
property
and
the
government
would've
been
entitled
to
ap
--
to
appeal
the
order
of
the
--
of
the
district
court
too.
however,
this
$14,000
is
–
is
in
litigation.
it
is
the
issue,
one
of
the
issues
in
the
criminal
case.
the
government
contends
that
this
$14,000
is
part
of
over
$30,000
stolen
in
the
bank
robbery
and
therefore
this
issue
must
await
the
criminal
case.
and
we
think
that
as
to
this
part
of
the
motion,
it
is
--
it
is
just
--
it
in
essence
asked
only
for
suppression
and
not
for
return
even
though
it
labels
--
the
motion
is
labeled
both
for
suppression
and
return.
now,
there
are
some
other
--there
is
some
other
property
involved
and
it's
listed
down
on
pages
15
and
16
of
our
brief,
it's
quite
an
extensive
list
but
most
of
it
is
--
is
extremely
trivial
royal
--
of
roles
of
coin
wrappers
and
all
things
of
that
nature.
now,
the
most
important
items
were
a
pistol,
three
pairs
of
slacks
and
a
sport
shirt.
now,
while
respondent
is
undoubtedly
entitled
to
the
return
of
this
property,
if
it
was
illegally
seized,
we
think
that
there
isn't
--
he
doesn't
have
a
substantial
enough
property
interest
in
these
materials
to
make
his
motion
to
return
in
regard
to
these
items
independent
of
the
criminal
case.
we
think
in
other
words,
that
his
motion
is
based
--
is
basically
a
motion
in
the
independent
--
in
this
part
of
the
criminal
case,
it
is
basically
a
motion
asking
for
suppression
and
not
for
return.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
two
--
two
points,
one
is
that
if
the
government
is
wrong
in
dibella
and
the
--
and
the
order
of
the
district
court
in
that
case
is
appealable
then
we
think
a
fortiori
the
order
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
appealable
by
the
government
that
the
only
factors
which
are
different
between
dibella
and
this
case
tend
to
show
that
the
order
in
this
case
was
more
--
was
more
final.
the
only
two
different
factors
are
that
here,
the
movement
asked
for
both
return
and
for
suppression.
in
dibella
he
asked
only
for
suppression
and
here,
the
motion
was
not
only
prior
to
indictment,
but
it
was
in
a
--
it
was
in
a
district
other
than
the
district
of
indictment
and
trial
and
we
think
both
those
factors
tend
to
make
it
more
final
of
those
i've
emphasized.
we
do
not
think
that
it
was
a
final
decision
that
neither
order
either
in
dibella
or
in
this
case
was
appealable.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
of
course
i've
indicated
to
you
that
there
are
three
lines
of
authorities
so
there's
no
--
there's
no
agreement
at
the
least.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
of
course,
we'd
be
glad
--
we
would
be
glad
to
do
it
if
your
--
the
court
wishes.
i
might
say
that
certainly
most
of
the
cases
are
contrary
to
the
government's
position.
we
--
we
do
not
contend
the
contrary.
recently,
the
court's
attended
away
from
allowing
these
mechanical
rules
of
appeal,
as
i've
indicated
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
circuits.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there's
a
very
little
thought.
it's
almost
entirely
relying
on
cogen,
on
burdeau
and
on
perlman
and
--
and
go-bart
which
themselves
had
almost
no
discussion
of
the
--
of
these
issues.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
cases
will
help
you
no
more,
your
honor.
but
if
--
if
the
court
wishes,
we
would
be
glad
to
set
forth
of
all
and
analyze
them.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'd
like
to
leave
the
minute
or
two
i
have
left.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
the
--
i
like
to
repeat
that
the
government
feels
that
is
the
same
right
of
appeal
under
section
1291
that
--
that
private
individuals
do.
the
narcotics
control
act
special
provision
deals
with
government
appeals
in
the
criminal
case.
1291
in
our
view
deals
only
with
appeals
that
are
not
in
the
criminal
case
and
that's
in
--
and
--
and
therefore,
we
think
neither
defendants
nor
the
government
can
appeal,
assuming
whether
non-narcotics
case
unless
they
come
under
1291
and
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
insofar
as
you're
asking
for
return,
we
think
--
we
think
that
rule
41
didn't
--
didn't
deprive
the
basic
right
of
individuals
to
seek
the
return
at
their
own
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
and
--
and
because
it's
labeled
under
41,
we
don't
think
makes
any
--
makes
any
particular
difference.
i'd
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
--
whether
the
issue
of
res
judicata
or
the
binding
nature
however
you
want
to
label
it,
is
before
the
court.
we
think
it
is
because
if
the
order
is
final
or
as
mr.
manners
said
to
the
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
this
is
a
final
judgment,
well
then
it's
a
final
decision
and
of
course
it's
appealable,
that's
what
the
--
that's
what
the
statute
explicitly
says.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
i
have
two
answers.
first
of
all
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
this
court
has
itself
indicated
that
there
is
a
very,
very
post
connection
between
the
two
and
that
is
in
the
wallace
company
case.
it
--
in
considering
a
res
judicata
problem
it
said
that
the
problem
was
essentially
the
same
as
for
appealability.
the
statement
of
judgments
says
it's
basically
the
same
issue,
but
your
honor
going
beyond
that,
we
think
that
even
if
--
that
even
if
this
order
is
appealable,
final
for
that
purpose,
it
may
not
be
final
for
purposes
of
res
judicata
or
on
--
or
however
you
want
to
label
it.
the
converse
though
is
not
true.
we
think
if
it
is
final
for
purposes
of
res
judicata
that
it
is
automatically
appealable.
in
other
words,
the
standards
insofar
as
they
--
as
they
are
different
allow
--
would
allow
appealability
while
not
making
the
order
absolutely
binding
on
the
trial
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that
--
that's
quite
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
the
reason
the
government
argued
this
issue
was
to
en
--
ensure
that
the
--
that
in
a
later
case,
it
would
not
be
held
that
this
order
was
absolutely
binding
in
the
trial
court
and
yet
in
this
case,
have
a
decision
that
the
order
was
not
appealable.
we
think
that
those
two
propositions
cannot
possibly
fit
together.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
he
does
your
honor,
but
he
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
except
for
his
--
because
--
except
for
his
stand
--
he's
going
to
contend
in
the
trial
court
that
it's
absolutely
binding.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
--
we
do
your
honor
and
the
court
--
and
if
we
all
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
your
--
we
want
him
--
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the
court
does
not
consider
this
issue
without
considering
the
--
the
other
--
the
possible
rami
--
ramifications
of
the
order
by
the
district
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
thank
you
your
honor.
