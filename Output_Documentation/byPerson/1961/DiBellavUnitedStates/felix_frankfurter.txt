justice
felix

could
you
first
deal
with
mr.
lewis'
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
open
to
you
to
deal
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
terris,
the
court
of
appeals
cited
half-a-dozen
cases
in
the
second
circuit
indicating
their
practice
to
be
to
allow
appealability
--
to
recognize
appealability.
what
is
the
court
law
in
the
lower
--
in
the
other
circuits,
mr.
terris?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
all
cases
where
the
motion
to
suppress
is
made
by
an
indicated
defendant
in
a
prospective
criminal
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
the
generalizations
covered
motions
not
by
a
third
party
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
perspective
witness,
but
by
the
potential
defendant
in
the
criminal
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
justification
for
the
district
of
columbia
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
justification
would
they
give,
i
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
considerations
that,
in
1789,
have
governed
appealability
as
a
general
principle
of
federal
jurisdiction,
what
is
the
difference
they
take?
did
they
take
any?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
discuss
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'd
give
him
both.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
give
him
both.
is
that
because
you're
large-hearted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
get
that
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
i'm
talking
about
the
chief
justice's
question.
you,
yourself,
made
a
distinction
between
a
motion
below
that
the
r
--
for
the
suppression
of
evidence
to
be
used
in
the
criminal
trial
and
the
return
of
$6,000
which
belonged
to
him.
you
say
if
he
goes
up
merely
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
no
appeal.
if
he
couples
with
that
the
--
a
motion
for
the
return
of
the
money,
the
return
of
the
money
carries
with
it
the
suppression
of
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
sense
of
that?
i
don't
see
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
good
judicial
administration.
i
call
it
large-heartedness.
what's
the
sense
of
it
so
far
as
your
main
pieces
is
concerned
that
you
do
not
want
to
try
separately
a
question
of
the
admissibility
of
evidence?
you
have
this
chance
in
case
he's
convicted.
in
case
he's
acquitted,
there's
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
allow
myself
to
saying
"so
what?"
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
may
not
necessarily
be
this
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
may
not
be
because
you
may
have
no
excuse
whatever
for
taking
the
money
and
you
may
have
good
excuse
for
taking
the
narcotics.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
--
pardon
me.
you
said
if
it's
illegally
seized,
i
thought
as
to
--
that
the
government's
position
that
whether
or
not
it
was
illegally
seized
could
be
appealed
from
if
the
court
decides
it
wasn't
illegally
seized?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
the
trial,
although
--
you
--
you
got
me
all
confused.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
the
whole
point
of
not
bringing
up
the
question
of
illegal
seizure
of
evidence
that
will
be
offered
in
evidence
ought
not
to
be
taken
out
and
isolated
from
the
general
prosecution,
but
should
be
left
for
out
--
eventual
determination
in
case
there
is
a
--
a
(inaudible)
of
guilt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
because
it's
valuable
that
the
--
that
the
ground
for
appeal
is
laid?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that
--
i
thought
the
great
issue
insofar
as
--
as
not
having
piecemeal
review
is,
that
if
this
is
part
of
the
criminal
trial,
that
you
must
await
the
outcome
of
the
criminal
trial
before
you
raise
the
question
of
illegality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
say
that
if
it's
money
and
it's
illegally
seized,
that
can
be
appealed.
if
it's
illegally
seized,
so
that
the
government
can
seize
if
illegally
seized,
of
course,
it
has
no
business
to
offer
it,
so
that
the
illegality
is
an
issue
in
contest.
i
don't
follow
you
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
why
do
you
contest
the
--
the
return
as
if
it's
--
if
you
should
return
it
without
having
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
you're
partly
taking
out
of
the
criminal
trial
before
its
conclusion,
a
part
of
the
criminal
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
what
in
the
issue
is,
whether
it
belongs
to
him?
is
that
the
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
unrelated
to
the
prosecution
or
related
to
it?
which?
justice
felix
frankfurter
related
and
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
a
problem,
but
it
may
not
bring
it.
that's
applicable
to
all
sorts
of
seizures,
money
or
not
money.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
this
will
be
--
but
you
may
not
have
that
--
that
opportunity
to
introduce
that
in
evidence
because
he
may
dissipate
that
valuable
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time
then,
but
you're
leaving
us
completely
confused.
justice
felix
frankfurter
precisely.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
by
calling
it
replevin,
you
don't
change
the
issue
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
--
a
piece
of
paper,
my
piece
of
paper
illegally
seized,
is
to
me
just
as
valuable
or
maybe
just
invaluable
as
a
$500
in
gold.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
want
to
call
it
replevin,
if
that
--
if
that
clarifies
the
issue
for
you,
it
doesn't
for
me.
a
motion
to
return
illegally
seized
property
is
a
motion
to
seize
illegally,
properties,
illegally
seize
property.
now
you
can
call
it
replevin,
and
that
clarifies,
if
that
analyzed
the
issue
for
you,
then
god
bless
you,
it
doesn't
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
you,
the
government
to
return
property
which
i
claim
is
illegally
seized
and
i
see
no
difference
between
a
book
of
mine
that
you
seized
or
a
letter
of
mine
or
a
carbon
copy
of
the
letter
than
money.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
everything
that
the
government
has
no
right
to
take
from
me,
is
valuable
to
me
and
it
isn't
for
you
say
it
is
invaluable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
narcotics.
that
is
a
totally
different
issue
that
it
doesn't
belong
to
anybody
and
you
can't
get
it
back.
i'm
talking
about
illegally
seized
evidence
which
i
claim
the
government
had
no
business
to
take
and
it
isn't
for
you
to
say
whether
it's
worth
five
cents
to
me
or
$500.
justice
felix
frankfurter
again,
it
may
be
worth
nothing
to
you
and
everything
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
might
question
some
more,
if
you
got
some
time
in
the
next
case.
the
chief
justice's
question
considered
the
word
“disassociated”
from
the
prosecution.
if
it's
disassociated,
then
there's
no
problem,
if
it's
disassociated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
problem
arises
if
the
government
has
in
its
possession
the
property.
i
don't
care
what
it
is.
a
worthless
heirloom,
a
worthless
occasion
that
would
--
that
might
be
inscribed
inside
which
is
an
heirloom
of
mine
in
which
incommensurable
value,
means
nothing
to
you,
and
it
was
seized
and
it's
claimed
to
be
useable
in
the
trial.
if
it's
not
claimed
to
be
usable
in
the
trial,
there
is
no
issue.
therefore,
i
get
down
to
every
kind
of
every
species
of
problem
and
i
do
not
see
the
difference
you
make
between
dollars
or
compared
to
dollars
which
i
tried
to
discourage
a
document
justice
felix
frankfurter
come
on,
forget
about
--
forget
about
de
minimis.
it
might
be
to
you
de
minimis
to
you,
to
the
government,
and
not
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
applies
then
to
every
species
of
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
document
for
the
fee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
--
therefore,
you
are
allowing
an
appeal
if
the
defendant
claims
that
he
needs
the
property
which
you
seized.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
that
is
the
truth
of
a
rule
that
there
should
be
--
there
should
not
be
an
appeal
that
might
be
true
about
some
--
some
judgment
although
within
a
motion
to
dismiss.
you
might
say,
“i
don't
want
to
be
hooked
up
now
for
six
months.
i've
just
drafted
this
interest
not
to
stay
until
the
trial
comes
on.”
would
you
allow
him
to
appeal
in
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
but
then
you
do
allow
then
you
do
with
the
same
effect,
that
in
every
case
whether
the
claim
of
illegally
seized
property,
a
claim
which
may
be
made
that
you
should
have
it
returned
at
least
once
before
the
trial.
that's
what
your
argument,
notwithstanding
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
contraband.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
that's
--
that
doesn't
--
that
raised
a
different
problem,
but
you
can
get
it
returning
though
because
this
is
yours.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
that
issue.
i'm
talking
about
what
is
crucial
in
these
two
case
whether
when
the
property
is
claimed
to
be
illegally
seized
and
the
prosecution
is
pending
whether
you
can
take
that
out
of
the
--
the
criminal
process
and
get
a
review
in
the
appellate
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now
you
left
me
all
in
the
dark
and
you
practically
take
back
the
whole
argument
that
you
may
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
--
we
didn't
stand
on
the
problem.
i'm
not
--
we
went
beyond
that.
we
didn't
refuse
to
take
your
argument
to
the
narcotic
case
and
that's
--
that's
not
a
difficult
problem.
the
difficulty
would
rise
from
the
situation
that
you
entered
into
discussion
with
chief
justice
that
namely,
money.
then
you
should
thought
to
differentiate
money
from
other
property.
for
my
self,
i
see
no
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
a
claim
of
--
a
claim
--
the
property
claimed
to
be
illegally
seized
and
the
question
is
whether
that
is
appealable
before
determination
of
the
criminal
prosecution.
and
you
now
say,
if
the
defendant
says,
“he
needs
it
badly,”
then
he
can
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
can
show
that
in
every
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
you
can
tell
them.
instead
i'm
taking
this
position,
that
of
taking
the
position
you
said,
probably,
yesterday,
probably
because
you
turned
on
such
distinctions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
even
suggesting
what
position
the
government
should
take.
if
the
government
says,
“i
would
disagree.”
the
government
says
that
--
that
you
can
review,
you
can
take
on
--
on
the
criminal
posit
and
every
included
step
before
termination.
i
could
understand
that
and
completely
disagree
with
it.
if
you
think
that's
issue
as
i
understand
it
from
my
standpoint,
i'm
going
to
be
against
it,
but
i
can't
understand
the
suppression.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
government
is
--
ought
not
to
be
in
a
difficulty
of
position
to
have
coherent
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
difficulties
are
not
something
from
which
the
government
ought
to
speak
and
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
should
there
be
a
difference?
why
should
the
difference
turn
on
whether
before
or
after
indictment,
if
in
fact,
the
criminal
process
has
started?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
should
that
be
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
when
i
say
the
criminal
process
had
started,
but
the
criminal
proceeding
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
a
--
a
proceeding
before
a
commission
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
the
commissioner
has
held
the
man,
but
was
pleading
before
the
grand
jury.
and
the
grand
jury
actively
is
engaged
in
considering
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
seizure
is
made
--
was
made
before
the
--
before
the
grand
jury
reports
the
indictment.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
law
is
that
if
the
seizure
--
if
the
--
if
your
motion
for
suppression
on
the
return
came
the
day
after
the
indictment,
is
appealable,
if
it
came
the
day
before
it
isn't
appealable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
the
motion
is
made
the
day
after
the
filing
of
the
indictment,
but
after
the
process
that
i've
indicated,
namely,
long
hearing
and
have
them
to
my
knowledge,
proceedings
before
the
united
states
commissioner
the
same
day.
and
at
the
end,
he
holds
the
man
from
the
grand
jury
and
they
have
the
man
who's
out
on
bail
in
the
proceedings
and
now
before
the
grand
jury.
before
the
grand
jury
returns
the
indictment,
you
--
you
move
with
the
suppression
of
documents.
according
to
your
move,
that's
appealable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
move
it
and
you
make
the
same
motion
the
day
after
indictment
is
not
appealable.
my
question
is,
why
is
that
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
is
pending
in
my
--
in
my
supposition,
a
proceeding
before
the
grand
jury
on
the
basis
of
the
commitment
by
the
--
by
the
commissioner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
the
indictment
has
come
down
by
the
time
the
motion
is
--
is
heard,
to
make
--
to
make
it
turn
that
you
make
it
turn
on
whether
an
indictment
is
done.
my
question
is,
whether
the
sensible,
rational
line
of
inquiries
--
whether
a
motion
just
for
a
return
of
documents
in
connection
with
the
criminal
process
that's
underway
to
be
appealable,
whether
the
indictment
has
been
initiated
or
not.
i
can
understand
--
i
can
well
understand
if
it's
not
appealable,
but
after
a
decent
period
is
as
--
or
the
grand
jury
adjourns
without
returning
an
indictment
that
the
--
that
the
prosecution
is
blown
up.
but
as
this
time,
i
don't
see
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
theory,
this
is
a
mechanical
rule,
at
least
not
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
this
non-appealability
is
a
mechanical
rule.
it's
one
of
the
few
things
about
which
you
can
say
there's
a
big
historic
principle
in
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
say
that
there
is
no
--
it
is
deemed
or
whatever
your
phrase
was.it
is
deemed
that
there's
nothing
pending?
that's
a
false
meaning.
that's
not
--
that
doesn't
accord
with
the
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
that
this
is
a
new
question
for
us,
an
undecided
question,
that
certainly
there's
no
decision,
whatever
the
talk
may
be
and
i'm
old-fashioned
enough
to
assume
there's
a
difference
between
inadequately
considered
talk
in
a
case
because
it
isn't
a
matter
before
the
court
and
a
decision
and
that
old-fashioned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
one
had
brought
to
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
carroll
opinions
had
occasion
to
say,
i
think
it's
not
without
significance
in
referring
to
the
earlier
case,
earlier
cases
illustrated
sometimes
without
inspection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
follow
you
again.
if
it's
--
double
jeopardy
has
not
yet
attached
then
why
is
the
government
no
right
of
appeal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
then
that
in
the
dickinson
case
but
i'm
--
i
take
it
to
these
two
cases
were
brought
here
to
reexamine
this
whole
question
and
i
don't
--
it
doesn't
satisfy
my
mind
to
stop
my
thinking
because
in
some
cases
where
the
question
wasn't
considered,
some
remarks
were
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
here
canvassing
a
very,
very
important
problem
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
just
(inaudible)
out
of
having
some
greater
strong
end.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
statute
says
its
final
and
this
doesn't
make
any
difference
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
doesn't
come
under
the
criminal
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
being,
criminal
of
appeals
that
sets
forth
specifically
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
kind
of
appeal
--
not
only
that,
but
the
criminal
appeal
that
deals
with
appeals
from
a
district
court
to
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
statute
as
to
appealability
of
final
orders,
there's
no
restriction
as
between
a
certain
case
that
final
orders
not
involved
with
double
jeopardy
arising
out
of
or
in
relation
to
a
criminal
case,
is
there?
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
--
but
another
question
has
been
raised
whether
the
--
the
government
has
more
limited
powers
in
a
crim
--
in
--
in
the
domain
of
criminal
law
where
double
jeopardy
isn't
involved.
now,
that
question
is
raised.
is
there
any
basis
in
any
legislation
on
that
code?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
that
but
the
narcotics
act
of
1956
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
may
draw
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
inferences
from
legislation.
the
narcotic
act
of
1956
has
indicated
a
congressional
policy
giving
the
government
more
right
than
the
defendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
a
report
on
the
basis
and
that
legislation
is
followed
because
congress
didn't
like
some
of
the
law
of
court
rulings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
in
fact
the
most
emphatic
not
only
explicit
legislation,
but
the
history
behind
that
showing
why
the
government
should
have
appealed
even
though
the
defendant
may
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
somewhat
--
apart
from
--
apart
from
whatever
may
be
the
general
rules,
specific
situations
may
arise
which
on
the
basis
of
the
specific
situation,
created
situation
of
unfairness
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
withholding
claimed
illegally
seized
property,
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
you
(voice
overlap)
--
once
you've
gone
to
the
question
of
delay
in
criminal
prosecutions
in
this
country,
then
you'll
raise
the
whole
question
of
great
unfairness
at
times
in
not
allowing
appeals
of
interlocutory
dispositions
in
the
case
of
defendant
who
shouts
his
innocence
to
high
heaven
and
for
all
one
knows,
maybe
his
innocence
has
--
in
an
ongoing
date
and
yet
he
cannot
appeal
from
any
one
of
the
crucial
interlocutory
motions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
reasons
that
are
now
settled
if
anything
can't
be
invaluable.
once
you
open
that
door
of
inconvenience,
near
inconvenience,
you
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
undermine
the
whole
--
the
whole
basis
of
--
of
non-appealability
of
interlocutory
proceed
--
steps
except
where
there
is
specific
legislation
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i
think
that's
--
i'm
not
suggesting
your
argument
does.
but
what
i'm
suggesting
having
said
that
there
may
be
special
situations,
i
want
to
qualify
my
own
statement
of
special
situation,
isn't
the
hardship
to
a
potential
defendant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
it
do
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
wasn't
referring
to
that
in
either,
i
am
just
referring
to
the
general
--
there's
always
this
large
leeway
of
a
particular
situation
taking
the
thing
out
of
the
command
of
whom
--
of
the
general
principle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
the
cases
where
--
where
the
claim
is
made
by
the
question
was
in
party
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
is
in
himself
a
party
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
after
the
--
a
criminal
party
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
taking
out
because
it
isn't
--
it's
unrelated
to
the
underlying
reasons
of
the
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
terris,
before
you
move
on,
may
i
put
this
to
you.
to
my
mind,
these
--
these
two
cases
from
--
involving
these
two
cases
is
a
far-reaching
importance
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
isn't
the
matter
as
to
district
--
before
the
lower
courts
for
great
many
years,
i
haven't
gone
from
their
cases,
and
i
wonder
if
it's
asking
too
much,
you
said,
you
agree
but
i
just
(inaudible)
not
seeing
you
having
done
any.
but
you
--
i
don't
think
the
government
has
done
what
i
think
needs
to
be
done
if
you
let
me
say
so
namely
to
make
a
comprehensive,
present
a
comprehensive
study
as
to
what
the
lower
courts
have
done
over
the
years?
why
they've
done
it?
what
discussion
these
cases
have
had
or
the
people
just
made
assumptions
that
would
stand
critical
analysis
because
if
there
has
been
a
uniform
or
an
impressive
rule
of
appealability,
say
for
the
last
50
years
and
before
a
--
of
judges
who
have
within
the
securities
of
these
matters,
that
would
--
that
would
make
an
impressive
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
there
isn't
any
but
if
there
is
an
impressive
general
direction
that
would
carry
a
great
deal
of
weight
with
me
at
least
because
the
instinct
of
judges
is
sometimes
better
than
their
reasoning
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
government
hasn't
done
that
and
i
wonder
if
we're
not
entitled,
at
least
as
i
can
speak
for
myself,
entitled
to
have
that
kind
of
exposition
from
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
they
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
me
what
kind
of
thought
was
brought
to
bear
or
wasn't
there
had
just
offhand
judgment
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
i'm
familiar
with
those
cases
and
they
don't
help
me
much
except
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
say
that
the
matter
wasn't
discussed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
indicated
what
--
what
position
is
to
me
relevant
for
consideration
and
i
leave
it
to
you
to
decide
as
one
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
stop
you
to
tell
us
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
took
place
if
anything
at
the
time
of
these
hearings?
was
there
any
--
was
there
any
beginning
of
a
criminal
proceeding
and
i
don't
mean
to
use
in
technical
terms?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
the
statute
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
at
that
time,
before
september
29th,
has
any
action
been
taken
by
the
--
by
the
government?
was
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
anything
started?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
legal
steps
taken,
any
legal
step?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manners,
can
we
decide
--
should
we
decide
--
or
is
that
actually
open
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
have
to
be
obedient
even
to
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
merely
the
question
here
is
--
the
problem
that
is
raised
is
the
problem
that
will
arise
at
trial,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there'll
be
a
ruling
at
that
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
ruling
may
be
for
you
or
against
you.
if
it's
against
you
and
your
client
is
acquitted,
then
you're
just
as
well
(inaudible)
good
for
you.
if
the
ruling
is
--
is
for
you
and
your
crime
is
--
if
the
client
in
ruling
is
against
you,
then
the
client
is
convicted
then
you
better
acclaim
to
address
simple
error.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
assuming
the
judge
doesn't
agree
with
that
and
therefore
there's
a
ruling
against
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
only
way
that
we
can
now
pass
on
the
question
that
--
that
is
before
us
that
you've
just
made,
that
is
not
in
this
court
is
on
the
assumption
that
we
can't
disperse
the
question
of
appealability
without
--
we
can't
decide
that
without
deciding
the
res
judicata.
for
myself,
i
don't
see
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
doesn't
practically
withdraw
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
we
agree
with
mr.
terris
and
say
there
are
three
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
separate
views.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
to
infer
that
that's
some
reason
if
there's
uniformity
of
you
and
the
circuit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manners,
just
as
a
footnote
to
what
you've
just
said
of
senator
daniel,
i
think
it's
relevant
to
say
that
this
provision
for
appealability
from
motions
granting
suppression
in
narcotics
cases
was
part
of
a
general
narcotics
bill
for
stiffening
the
government's
hands
and
not
(inaudible)
whether
they
should
exhibit
it,
but
if
it
was
part
of
a
large
bill
with
reference
to
this
particular
kind
--
class
of
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
--
it's
finality
for
purposes
of
an
appeal
necessarily
equal
to
res
judicata.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
my
whole
--
that
is
my
whole
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
have
appealability
not
as
res
judicata.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
you
think
he
had
--
not
taken
in
this
(inaudible)?
