mr.
milton
i.
newman
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
judge,
justice,
gentlemen
of
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
it
involves
the
constitutionality
of
an
ordinance
of
the
town
of
hempstead.
i
shall
presently
go
into
some
of
the
details
of
statute,
but
in
introducing
the
statute,
i
say
to
your
honors
that
this
statute
prohibits
the
further
excavation
of
sand
and
gravel
under
any
circumstances
in
the
town
of
hempstead
where
there's
water.
it
prevents
anymore
excavation
under
water.
now
in
this
case,
the
appellants
goldblatt
and
the
corporation,
he's
a
100%
owner
of
the
corporation,
one
is
the
operator
of
the
business
of
excavating
and
the
other
appellant
owns
the
property.
it
involves
38
acres
of
property
in
the
town
of
hempstead
in
the
county
of
nassau
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
believe,
are
not
in
dispute,
certainly
not
the
material
facts
upon
which
the
decision
in
this
case,
i
think
rests
or
will
elementally
rest.
there's
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
excavation
here
started
in
1927.
mr.
goldblatt's
father
was
then
the
owner
of
this
property
and
has
been
in
continuous
operation
from
1927
down
to
the
time
that
this
case
started
in
19
--
from
1927
down
to
1959
when
this
case
started.
that's
i
think
30
--
32
years
and
during
that
time
i
must
say,
one
year
after
it
started,
water
was
dry.
so
for
30
years
or
more,
excavation
has
been
taking
place
underwater
in
this
under
--
over
these
38
acres.
actually
now,
the
--
the
water
covers
20
of
the
38
acres
and
that
situation
has
been
in
existence
since
1928
because
the
testimony
without
any
contradiction
is
that
one
year
after
they
started,
as
stated
your
honors,
they
struck
water
and
pond
or
the
water
has
been
there.
now,
i'd
like
to
state
at
very
(voice
overlap)
mr.
milton
i.
newman
no
since
the
judge
--
not
since
the
judge
in
this
case
granted
the
injunction
in
1950
--
mr.
milton
i.
newman
oh
yes
--
well,
certainly
yes
sir.
i
say
certainly
because
the
only
testimony
in
the
case
is
that
the
deposits
there
have
not
been
exhausted.
he
was
working
right
up
until
the
time
of
the
injunction
below.
now
if
your
honor
please,
i'd
like
to
say
at
the
very
beginning
something
about
this
man
made
lake
because
i
think
this
was
the
thinking
of
a
lower
court
that
tried
the
case
and
you'll
find
throughout
the
brief
here
such
words
as
used
as
is
if
this
is
a
--
a
sprawling
crater.
this
is
a
--
there
are
other
pits
like
this
where
children
drowned.
i
don't
know
about
other
pits.
i'm
talking
about
this
pit
and
i'm
talking
about
this
record
on
appeal.
if
your
honors
please,
we
now
have
38
acres,
20
acres
as
i
say,
covered
with
water.
the
depth
is
25
feet
deep
average,
over
the
20
acres.
some
places
as
deep
as
40
feet.
this
lake
and
there
are
pictures
here.
the
pictures
of
the
original
exhibits
are
in
the
court.
they're
not
printed
in
this
record
but
the
exhibits
number
6
and
i
ask
your
honors
to
notice
that
it's
the
number
six
pictures
which
are
ours
and
those
pictures
show
a
lake
no
different
from
a
god
made
lake.
i
mean,
i'm
talking
about
central
park
in
new
york
or
prospect
park
or
lake
whitney
or
some
lake
in
--
in
washington.
it's
water,
it's
a
lake
and
it's
covered,
surrounded,
the
whole
38
acres
by
a
six
foot
fence
surrounded
on
the
top
with
three
strands
of
barbed
wire.
now
if
your
honors
please,
i
tell
you
in
1927,
as
when
we
started
to
excavate
and
it
wasn't
until
1945
that
this
town
of
hempstead
even
said
we
had
to
have
a
fence.
1945
did
come
around
and
there
was
a
fence
put
up
and
that
fence
is
the
six
foot
fence
with
three
strands
of
barbed
wire
on
the
top
of
it.
and
the
1945
statue
is
a
regular
tort
statue,
it
talks
about
the
slanted
slope
and
it
talks
about
the
width
of
barb
and
it
talks
about
the
fence.
those
are
regular
--
regulations
which
we
complied
with
in
1945.
no
proceeding
was
brought
against
us
under
the
1945
ordinance.
it's
a
1948,
i'm
jumping
just
for
a
minute,
that
we
have
the
amendment
of
the
ordinance
which
we
challenge
here
as
being
unconstitutional.
now
if
your
honors
please,
in
1956,
is
the
time
that
the
town
of
hempstead
first
got
after
us.
so
i
may
say,
get
after
us,
i
mean
first
bought
their
first
legal
proceeding
and
that
was
a
proceeding
in
nassau
county
to
prevent
us
from
further
excavating
under
water
on
the
ground
that
it
was
violation
of
the
zoning
act
and
that
case
was
tried.
it
was
tried
before
mr.
justice
hill
in
nassau
county
and
as
an
appendix
to
--
in
my
brief,
we
have
an
opinion
and
a
judgment
in
that
case
and
briefly
summarizing
that
opinion
in
the
judgment,
the
court
says
that
he
finds
--
i'm
going
to
quote
--
read
one
sentence,
he
finds
that
the
defendants,
that's
the
appellants
here
are
now
and
have
been
since
1927
conducting
a
prior
non-conforming
use
on
the
premises
and
they
have
made
such
a
substantial
investment
and
improvements
in
the
business
to
warrant
the
continuance
of
this
non-conforming
use.
now
when
the
judgment
was
entered
in
this
case,
this
is
clear
sailing,
the
judge
says,
“we
have
a
right
to
go
on”
and
we
did
go
on
in
1956
and
in
1957.
there
was
no
appeal
taken
from
mr.
justice
hill's
decision
that
we
had
non-conforming
use,
but
the
town
brought
another
action
in
1957.
i
only
say
this
by
way
of
completion
because
that
1957
action
is
not
important
here.
in
1957,
they
came
around
and
again
brought
us
in
the
court
on
the
ground
that
we
were
trying
to
then
extend
our
excavation
activities
to
the
extent
of
entering
into
some
other
allied
business
and
i
think
the
court
properly
said,
--
or
at
least
it
said
the
court
held
--
the
new
york
court
held
that
that
was
not
a
proper
extension
of
our
non-conforming
use.
i
only
state
that
in
passing
because
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
opinion
now
with
our
ultimate
decision.
now,
comes
1958,
and
in
1958,
no
appeal
from
the
decision
of
mr.
justice
hill,
but
the
amend
--
but
the
enactment
of
the
1958
ordinance
with
these
provisions
particularly
sections
4
(h)
and
4
(j)
which
we
challenge
in
this
proceeding
in
this
court
this
time.
now,
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
might
say
that
contemporaneously
with
the
making
of
the
new
1958
ordinance
and
before
this
action
in
1959
was
started,
there
was
some
talks
between
the
town
officials
and
the
people
that
own
this
property,
the
appellants
in
this
case,
a
possibility
of
taking
this
property,
of
paying
for
the
property
because
it
was
going
to
be
used
in
connection
with
that
drainage
system
and
actually
in
this
case,
is
exhibit
c,
that
contained,
that
consists
of
a
drainage
map
which
shows
actually
the
plan
of
having
the
surrounding
territories
water
drain
ends
to
this
man
made
lake.
but
nothing
came
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
the
meetings
between
the
town
and
--
and
the
people
that
owned
the
property
and
since
the
record
doesn't
contain
the
material,
i
won't
go
further
and
say
why
i
think
they
didn't
continue
with
the
talks
as
far
as
condemnation
is
concerned
but
they
didn't
condemn
it.
what
they
did
instead
is
to
pass
the
1958
ordinance
and
then
bring
this
litigation.
now,
if
your
honor
pleases,
it
is
so
important
because
of
the
element
challenge
of
the
question
of
whether
this
statute
does
prohibit
that
i
must
read
you
only
two
lines,
that
section
4
(h)
which
does
prohibit.
that's
on
47
of
my
brief,
this
paragraph
section
4
(h)
of
the
ordinance.
it
says
no
excavation
shall
be
made
below
two
feet
above
the
maximum
ground
water
level
at
the
site.
simply
translated
and
there
can't
be
dispute
about
this,
all
it
says
is
that
you
can't
dig
below
water
level.
a
matter
of
fact,
you
can't
dig
below
two
feet
above
water
level.
put
it
another
way,
you
can't
dig
under
water.
they
can't
be
anymore
water
excavation
here,
no
more
hydraulic
dredging.
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
words
that
appellee
used
he
says
water
table.
maybe,
he
doesn't
like
the
word
water
level,
but
he
talks
about
water
table.
now,
there's
no
question
about
the
fact
as
i
told
you
in
the
beginning,
that
since
1928,
this
property
has
been
25
feet
below
water
level.
we
definitely
violate
the
ordinance.
there's
no
question
about
it.
we
can't
comply
with
the
ordinance.
the
ordinance
says,
“don't
dig
below
water
level.”
we
dig,
we
dug
that
hole
below
water
level
30
years
ago.
the
statute
goes
on
further
and
4
(j)
says,
“not
only
may
you
no
longer
dig
below
water
level,”
it
says,
“you
got
to
fill
up
the
hole
that
you
made”
and
this
hole
is
20
acres
wide.
and
--
and
the
testimony
of
the
town's
witnesses
is
that
one
million
cubic
yards
have
been
removed
from
these
20
acres.
and
we
are
told
in
section
4
(j)
of
the
statute,
that's
a
little
longer,
but
that's
on
page
47,
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
time
to
read
that.
that
says,
“when
the
earth
is
been
removed
from
the
pit
excavation
area,
it
must
be
refilled
with
clean,
non-burnable
fill,
containing
no
garbage,
they
give
you
all
the
specifications
from
the
clean
fill.”
they
want
a
million
cubic
yards
of
fill
to
be
put
back
into
this
20
acres
which
we
removed
legally.
mr.
milton
i.
newman
it's
definitely
before
your
honor
pleases
because
the
fact
that
we
cannot
only
--
most
of
the
cases
in
this
court
are
only
on
prohibition.
we
are
not
only
--
no
longer
allowed
to
excavate,
we
are
told
to
put
something
back.
i
said
in
my
brief
and
i've
tried
to
read
every
applicable
case
that
i
never
saw
a
statute.
i
never
saw
a
town
or
--
or
municipality
or
a
legislature
which
had
the
temerity
of
telling
you
not
only
to
stop
but
put
back
what
you
legally
took
out
and
my
friends
have
not
answered
me
on
that.
apparently
they
have
never
found
--
mr.
milton
i.
newman
if
your
honor
pleases,
is
not
only
injunction
but
section
10
says,
“there's
a
$500
fine”
and
also
not
the
criminal
penalty
and
each
week's
--
apparently
the
section
10
of
the
statute
says,
“a
violation
of
this
statute
or
any
section
shall
be
punishable
by
a
fine
of
not
more
than
$500
or
imprisonment
for
a
period
not
exceeding
six
months
for
each
offense
or
by
both
such
fine
and
imprisonment.”
each
week
of
continued
violation
shall
constitute
a
separate
additional
violation.
mr.
milton
i.
newman
not
--
not
--
not
so
far
as
i
know.
i
mean,
they
brought
this
injunction.
presently,
they're
satisfied
with
the
injunction.
now
of
course
we
haven't
(voice
overlap)
mr.
milton
i.
newman
well,
yes
sir.
that's
part
of
--
that's
part
of
the
--
that's
part
of
a
judgment
in
this
case.
the
judgment
in
this
case
says
that
we
have
violated
the
statute
in
various
ways
and
one
of
the
ways
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
milton
i.
newman
yes.
mr.
milton
i.
newman
if
your
honor
pleases,
it
says
that
the
defendants
have
failed
to
refill
the
pit
--
excavation
of
course,
there
have
been
those
places
where
the
earth
has
already
been
removed
to
the
maximum
extent
allowed
under
the
law.
now,
if
you're
asking
--
that's
the
extent.
let
me
answer
your
question
that
way
sir
and
i
can
say
to
you
that
of
course
these
people
haven't
done
anything
by
the
fact
since
this
case
has
been
going
up
into
the
court.
but
i
dare
say
if
this
case
is
affirmed
by
this
court,
i
am
sure
i
know
what
the
town
is
going
to
do
when
we
don't
fill
it
up.
actually,
we're
never
going
to
be
able
to
fill
it
up.
it
will
cost
a
million
dollars
at
least
–-
mr.
milton
i.
newman
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
milton
i.
newman
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
must
say
to
your
honor
that
in
the
courts
below,
i
didn't
handle
this
from
the
beginning,
but
in
the
courts
below,
there
was
a
section
of
the
brief
that
said
that
maybe
this
statute
is
constitutional
if
you
were
--
as
you
apply
to
us,
it
doesn't
talk
about
--
it
doesn't
apply
to
something
that
was
--
that
was
dug
before
this
ordinance
was
passed.
that's
right
you
see.
there
was
a
possibility
of
interpreting
that
way,
but
i
didn't
include
the
brief
in
that
--
in
that
point
in
this
case
because
it's
been
interpreted
by
all
the
courts
below
as
applying
to
us.
and
as
applied
to
us,
my
humble
opinion,
it
must
be
unconstitutional
because
it
is
taking
away
our
property
without
due
process
of
law.
it's
not
paying
for
taking
away
the
privilege
of
further
excavating
as
in
requiring
us
to
fill
that
pit.
now
when
your
honor,
i
think
i
got
your
honor's
question
that
if
it
were
interpreted
so
that
it
did
not
apply
to
us,
then
of
course,
i
wouldn't
be
here.
i
mean
then
(voice
overlap)
mr.
milton
i.
newman
that's
right.
it
would
be.
mr.
milton
i.
newman
yes
sir.
now
in
the
court
of
appeals,
let
me
--
let
me
start
by
saying,
we
had
a
trial
court
sitting
of
course
without
a
jury
in
injunction
case
who
held
that
this
was
constitutional,
mainly
on
the
ground
that
it
is
regulatory.
this
is
only
regulatory.
it
doesn't
prevent
us
from
doing
anything.
all
we
got
to
do
is
comply
with
the
statute.
the
appellate
division,
five
judges
affirmed
without
opinion
and
i
might
say
to
you
in
passing,
if
your
honors
please,
that
when
i
came
to
the
case
and
made
application
of
the
appellate
division
for
leave
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
because
i
had
no
dissent,
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
constitutional
question
there,
the
appellate
division
apparently
didn't
even
recognize
the
fact
--
turn
me
down
they
said,
“there's
no
constitutional
question
involved.”
i
made
the
same
application
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
leave
to
appeal
thereon
the
constitutional
question
and
24
hours
later,
the
court
of
appeals
says,
“yes,
of
course
it's
a
constitutional
question.”
i
don't
mean
those
are
those
words.
the
telegram
said,
“you're
allowed
to
appeal
here
as
a
matter
of
right
because
of
the
constitutional
question
involved.”
in
the
court
of
appeals
your
honors
please,
there
are
two
opinions.
it's
a
four-three
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
the
majority
of
opinion
written
by
mr.
--
by
judge
burke,
says
and
i'm
summarizing
it
now,
that
this
is
constitutional
because
and
these
words
are
taken
out
of
the
briefs
in
my
friends,
the
appellees
in
this
case.
of
course
it
only
requires
minimum
--
minimal
safety
requirements
and
all
you've
got
to
do
is
make
an
application
and
get
a
license
to
do
these
things.
and
it
does
not,
i'm
quoting
now,
it
does
not
proscribe
a
further
excavation.
that's
the
reason
i
said
to
you
if
your
honors
please,
that
under
4
(h)
when
they
say
we
can't
go
below
water
level,
and
we've
been
below
water
level
and
we've
been
digging
until
the
time
that
they
make
the
ordinance,
they
can't
be
in
disputed
as
my
judgment
about
the
fact
that
it
is
definitely
proscription,
prohibition.
it
is
definitely
not
minimal
requirements
of
any
kind.
it
is
--
it
is
definitely
prohibitory
and
confiscatory.
judge
--
judge
van
voorhis,
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
which
two
other
judges
join
him,
reaches
the
conclusion
as
he
states
that
this
is
no
regulatory
provision.
this
is
no
regulatory
ordinance.
this
is
prohibitory.
now,
i
like
to
come,
if
i
may,
to
something
about
the
approach
of
the
majority
opinion
and
also
the
--
of
the
argument
of
the
appellee.
i'm
--
the
argument
about
regulation
brings
them
to
the
one
rule
upon
which
i
think
all
the
courts
below
who
upheld
in
favor
this
constitutionality
have
depended
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
presumption
of
constitutionality.
now,
the
presumption
of
constitutionality,
that's
what
judge
burke
talks
about
and
he
cites
the
saxl
case
decided
by
this
court
and
he
cites
engel
--
engelsher
against
jacobs.
those
are
the
two
cases
i
remember,
the
main
cases
he
cites
there.
he
says,
“since
this
is
regulatory,
there
was
a
presumption
of
regulatory
--
of
constitutionality
and
we
didn't
show
anything
to
overcome
that
presumption.”
i
am
now
summarizing
what
is
more
at
length
written
in
my
brief
in
deciding
the
cases
that
if
your
honors
please,
there
is
no
presumption
of
constitutionality
with
respect
to
a
statute
which
prohibits.
it's
only
a
statute
which
regulates
that
you'd
have
a
presumption
of
constitutionality.
i'll
go
one
step
further,
if
your
honors
please
and
say
to
you,
meeting
square
on
this
question
of
presumption
of
constitutionality
upon
which
the
majority
opinion
relies
and
upon
which
the
appellee
mains
--
makes
their
main
argument
that
if
there
were
such
a
presumption,
the
presumption
in
this
case
is
certainly
overcome
by
the
fact
that
we
have
a
non-conforming
use
of
our
property.
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
cases
uniformly
hold
that
you
cannot
legally
constitutional
--
constitutionally
deprive
a
man
of
his
non-conforming
use
without
paying
for
it.
the
decisions,
there
are
a
lot
of
current
decisions
and
one
of
the
most
important
i
think
is
the
most
recent
as
the
--
the
term
in
this
case,
is
the
harbison
case
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
dealing
with
this
question
of
how
do
you
get
rid
of
a
nonconforming
use
which
is
a
problem
presented
before
so
many
of
the
towns
of
america
there.
how
do
you
that
constitutionally?
and
they
have
held
that
the
only
question
is
how
much
do
you
have
to
pay
and
the
harbison
case
said,
“well,
you
can
tell
them
that
in
the
future,
they're
going
to
have
to
quit
doing
the
jump
as
that
was
what
in
the
harbison
case
and
so
you
amortize
over
a
period
of
years,
their
investment
in
the
business.
we
don't
have
any
such
thing
in
this
case
at
all.
they
don't
pay
us
anything
for
telling
us
to
quit
our
business
and
fill
up
what
was
legally
made.
now,
i
say
to
you
your
honors
we
are
--
if
we
have
the
--
if
we
had
the
presumption
--
mr.
milton
i.
newman
i'm
relying
on
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
sir
and
the
case
is
directly
at
point
is
pennsylvania
coal
case
against
mahon.
in
that
case,
that
case
involved
the
pennsylvania
statute
which
said
that
you
could
not
dig
under
a
man's
house
because
legislature
said
and
the
governor
said
in
--
in
--
in
the
legislation
of
that
--
in
the
making
of
that
statute
that
it
was
dangerous
to
dig
under
a
man's
house.
but
the
--
the
land
owner
in
that
case
had
reserved
the
right
to
dig
when
he
sold
the
house
above
to
the
--
to
the
people
and
that
in
my
opinion
was
a
much
stronger
case
than
this
case
where
there's
no
--
no
evidence
at
all
of
danger.
i'm
coming
that
in
a
minute.
there's
no
evidence
on
the
--
in
that
pennsylvania
coal
case,
it
would
seem
to
me
just
as
a
layman
that
is
pretty
dangerous
to
dig
under
a
man's
house,
but
they
said
--
this
court
said,
it's
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
holmes,
he
said
certainly,
it
maybe
dangerous
in
maybe
the
public
will
requires
that
you
have
this
legislation
but
you
can't
do
without
paying
the
man
for
his
property
right,
for
his
legal
rights
of
excavating.
he
has
the
right
to
dig
under
--
under
there
by
contract
module
only.
in
this
case,
we
have
the
right
to
dig
there
because
it's
on
our
property.
now,
may
i
your
honors
please,
bring
you
what
i
consider
to
be
the
answer
to
this
question
of
where
does
the
danger
and
the
nuisance
come
in?
where
does
that
come
in
on
a
legal
process
here?
well,
if
your
honors
please
in
this
--
in
the
camarco
case,
that's
a
court
of
appeals
case
in
new
york,
they
held
squarely
that
when
you
have
a
non-conforming
use
and
we
do
of
course,
we
do
--
i
don't
have
to
argue
that,
we
have
it
legally
and
that
decision
of
mr.
justice
hill.
when
you
have
that
you
cannot
constitutionally
come
along
with
a
statute
and
say
that
the
man
has
--
you
can't
deprive
a
man
of
that
constitutional
non-conforming
use,
but
the
court
said,
of
course
if
there's
a
nuisance
here,
that's
something
else.
it
says
it
by
a
way
of
dictum.
now,
let
come
to
this
question
nuisance.
on
this
question
of
nuisance,
number
one,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
appellee
here
admitted
on
the
argument
that
there
was
no
nuisance
in
the
operation
of
our
underwater
excavation.
he
challenges
here
the
question
of
whether
he
made
that
observation.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
the
one
who's
contesting
you
with
them.
judge
jan
van
voorhis
in
his
opinion,
expressly
states
that
on
the
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals,
counsel
for
the
appellee
admitted
there
was
no
nuisance,
but
i'll
go
further
in
that
concession.
i'm
not
going
to
decide
whether
judge
van
voorhis
or
my
friend
here
is
right
about
that.
i'm
talking
now
about
going
beyond
that.
number
one,
there
was
no
evidence
of
nuisance.
now,
who
would
have
to
prove
nuisance
in
order
to
sustain
this
legislation?
certainly,
the
man
that
owns
the
property
wouldn't
have
to
show
that
his
property
was
a
nuisance
in
order
to
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
it
would
necessarily
follow
that
the
town
would
show
nuisance.
they
have
not
only
shown
nuisance,
but
the
proof
in
the
record
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
we
have
a
six
foot
wire
of
fence
that
there
has
--
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
single
trespasser,
not
a
single
accident,
not
a
single
death,
not
a
single
cave-in,
no
property
damage
and
this
is
under
30
years
margin,
30
years
of
operation,
15
years
in
which
there
wasn't
even
fence
around
there
because
we
weren't
required
to
have
it
fenced
until
1945.
now
i
say
the
facts
in
the
case
certainly
would
show
that
there's
no
nuisance.
there
was
no
proof
of
nuisance.
there
was
a
concession
of
no
nuisance
and
certainly
there
was
no
nuisance
per
se
in
the
fact
that
there's
water
there.
and
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
this
water
because
this
water
you
see,
when
they
talk
about
sprawling
crater,
again
the
trial
judge
talked
about
sprawling
crater.
there's
the
implication
that
there's
something,
somewhere,
something
wrong
about
water,
except
that
i'm
page
11
of
their
brief,
they
have
now
said,
we
don't
contend
that
there's
any
nuisance
per
se
in
water
or
in
excavating
so
we
don't
have
to
contend
with
that.
but
there
is
that
aura
that
--
that
atmosphere
of
something
wrong
with
water
and
i'm
coming
back
and
saying
to
your
honors
that
because
we
have
water,
that
doesn't
make
our
--
our
operations
dangerous.
mr.
milton
i.
newman
well,
if
they
said
that
they
couldn't
be,
i
don't
--
you
mean
in
his
privately
owned
property?
mr.
milton
i.
newman
well
certainly
you
would
--
yes.
mr.
milton
i.
newman
well
they
could
say,
you
got
to
put
a
fence
around
it.
they
could
say
you
got
to
police
it.
they
could
say
you
got
to
do
things
to
prevent
people
from
coming
in
possibly
if
your
honor
pleases
in
manhattan,
they
might
say
because
as
eight
million
people
here
but
i
would
say,
they
couldn't
say
you
can't
have
a
lake
in
the
middle
of
the
town.
at
least
they
haven't
done
it.
mr.
milton
i.
newman
i
know
but
you
--
mr.
milton
i.
newman
that's
right.
i
would
say
that
would
be
so
if
your
honor
please.
they
could
say
you
got
to
put
a
fence
around.
mr.
milton
i.
newman
precisely
and
in
this
case,
it
goes
further
than
that
because
they
took
our
business
without
due
process
of
law.
i
mean
--
mr.
milton
i.
newman
yes.
i
might
say
one
--
i'm
trying
to
conclude
here
in
five
minutes.
the
fact
that
the
town
now
realizes
that
they
made
a
mistake
if
they
didn't
bring
any
evidence
of
nuisances,
they
bring
in
by
the
--
they
bring
in
one
case
one
death,
which
they
claimed
took
place
in
1944.
it's
not
on
the
record,
it's
not
on
the
record,
it
was
not
in
the
trial,
in
1944,
before
there
was
any
requirement
by
the
town
itself,
that
it
has
a
fence
around
it.
i'm
just
going
to
say
in
passing,
if
they
have
a
right
to
tell
you
about
one
death
that
took
place
in
1944,
i
have
a
right
to
tell
you
that
by
the
police
records
of
the
city
of
new
york,
i
discovered
that
1960
with
three
deaths
in
central
park
and
one
in
prospect
park,
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
with
eliminating
a
man's
business.
you
honors
mr.
justice
--
judge
van
voorhis
said,
“automobiles
kill
people.”
you
don't
get
rid
automobiles
because
people
are
killed.
you
regulate
them,
but
you
don't
get
rid
of
automobiles.
trichinosis
brings
on
a
disease
but
you
don't
get
rid
of
selling
pork
because
trichinosis
may
--
may
come
from
the
eating
of
pork.
i
want
to
say
in
passing
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
this
statute
and
i
have
argued
in
my
brief
also
violates
the
ex
post
facto
laws
both
criminal
and
civil.
i
think
the
court
has
gone
beyond
the
question
of
necessity
of
having
a
criminal
law
involved
in
order
to
have
ex
post
facto
but
in
this
case,
you
got
ex
post
facto
as
far
as
the
criminal
law
is
concerned,
with
those
sections
that
i
read
you,
section
10
of
the
act.
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
that
under
the
fleming
case,
this
is
even
a
violation
of
the
statute
--
of
the
constitutional
provision
with
respect
bill
of
attainder
because
of
the
fact
that
we
are
the
only
operating
sand
pit
excavation
company
in
this
entire
town
of
nassau
--
town
of
hempstead.
and
there's
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
history
of
this
thing
in
the
1945
proceedings
in
court
and
the
1946
proceedings
with
respect
to
try
to
get
rid
of
this
first
by
zoning
and
then
talking
news
about
condonation
and
then
finally
passing
the
statute
means
they
pointed
the
statute
directly
at
us.
but
i
don't
think
--
well,
i
think
that
directly
comes
under
that
--
under
the
both
those
sections
of
the
constitutionally.
your
honor
please
i
like
to
finally
say
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
main
opinion
written
by
judge
burke
talks
about
the
fact
that
there
must
be
progress,
i
won't
argue
with
them
that
it
must
be
progress.
i
won't
argue
with
them
with
respect
to
whether
he
think
--
whether
the
legislator
is
right
in
thinking
they'd
like
to
get
rid
of
our
pit.
there's
no
question
they
want
to
get
rid
of
our
excavation.
for
all
i
say
to
you
is
in
the
words
of
justice
holmes
--
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
pennsylvania
coal
case,
we
are
in
danger
of
forgetting
that
a
strong
public
desire
to
improve
the
public
condition
is
not
enough
to
warrant
achieving
the
desire
by
a
shortcut
in
the
constitutional
way
of
paying
for
the
change
and
that's
all
we're
asking.
i
mean
this
is
unconstitutional
to
say
that
you
got
a
stop
doing
what
you
did
for
30
years
legally
and
then
refill
it
up
and
not
pay
us
for
it.
if
i
have
a
little
time
--
if
i
have
a
little
time,
may
i
take
it
--
may
i
have
couples
minutes
on
rebuttal.
mr.
milton
i.
newman
on
rebuttal
i
mean.
mr.
milton
i.
newman
no.
