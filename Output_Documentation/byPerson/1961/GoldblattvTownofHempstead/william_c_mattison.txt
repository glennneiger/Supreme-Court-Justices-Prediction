mr.
william
c.
mattison
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
just
before
he
died
and
probably
his
last
recorded
interview,
leonard
hand
deprecated
his
life
on
the
bench
with
a
comment
to
an
author
that
he
has
spent
his
life
shoveling
smoke.
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
with
humility
and
sincerity
that
difficult
as
the
judicial
process
is,
it
becomes
even
more
so,
when
a
record
has
been
made
implosively,
acceptable
by
its
interpretation
both
and
briefs
and
in
oral
argument.
this
morning
--
this
afternoon,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
initially
to
some
of
the
incorrect
statements
that
have
made
--
have
been
made
with
respect
to
the
brief,
the
proof
of
this
case
as
it
unfolded.
in
the
first
place
through
all
the
courts,
and
in
six
memorandum
and
specific
language
of
our
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
we
said,
“pits
like
this
constitute
a
public
nuisance.”
we
urged
that
this
nuisance,
that
this
pit
was
nuisance.
and
when
judge
van
vhooris
asked
me,
“did
i
contend
it
with
nuisance.”
i
said,
“your
honor,
i
do
not
have
to
contend
that
it
is
a
nuisance,
because
i
do
have
the
affirmative
on
this
burden”
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
my
inarticulate
answer
to
him
was
because
of
some
confusion
which
--
for
which
perhaps
i
was
responsible.
this
pit
is
a
nuisance.
we
maintain
that
the
record
shows
it's
a
nuisance
and
we
maintain
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
which
opened
the
argument
that
there
was
no
factual
proof
of
confiscation
in
this
record.
the
question
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
was,
“was
there
any
economic
use
left?”
now,
there
is
no
proof
at
the
trial
at
all,
and
the
trial
court
so
held
in
its
long
and
comprehensive
opinion
that
there
were
any
available
deposits
that
worth
mining
on
the
question
of
factual
confiscation
under
the
lake.
there
was
a
total
failure
of
proof
with
respect
to
the
18
acres
which
remain
above
land,
and
the
trial
court
pointed
out
that
on
this
record,
the
appellant's
may
still
mine
that
18
acres.
now,
this
ordinance
was
a
companion
ordinance
to
--
an
ordinance
that
was
passed
in
the
town
of
hempstead
--
town
of
north
hempstead
and
town
of
oyster
bay,
the
--
the
three
towns
making
up
nassau
county
in
1945.
and
as
the
ordinances
all
of
them
in
their
identical
declarations
and
in
their
regulatory
provisions
mandate,
the
danger
to
which
the
decree
was
addressed
was
a
three
fold,
one.
first
to
the
threat
of
water
pollution,
to
pollution
of
the
water
table,
nassau
county
draws
all
its
water
from
this
subterranean
table,
second,
to
the
unsettling
of
houses
surrounding
the
community
of
these
pits
and
third
and
perhaps
most
important
of
all
to
the
threat
of
drowning
of
little
children
in
the
pits.
in
--
a
1957
case,
12
years
after
the
enactment
of
this
ordinance
which
case
we
cite
on
our
brief.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
nassau
county
pointed
out
that
it
is
a
common
knowledge
that
heretofore
many
lives
of
young
children
have
been
lost
in
these
pits.
now,
against
this
background
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
the
language
in
the
(inaudible)
case
was
to
unguarded,
unregulated
pits
and
of
course
mr.
chief
justice,
we
take
that
as
our
starting
point
in
the
regulation
of
the
pits
to
make
this
three-fold
threat
to
our
community.
now,
the
first
suggestion
is
that
this
is
a
tailor-made
ordinance
and
i
think
that
the
common
knowledge
to
which
the
courts
have
reverted
and
our
appellate
division
unanimously
affirmed
and
our
court
of
appeals
referred
to
this
refutes
the
suggestion
that
this
was
some
criminal
conspiracy
in
which
this
town
engaged
to
eliminate
this
use
by
these
defendants.
today,
there
has
been
another
misstatement
which
has
been
a
continuing
one
for
the
record
that
there
wasn't
total
compliance
with
the
1945
ordinance
as
it
was
first
enacted.
the
court
will
look
in
vain
to
find
support
to
this
statement.
the
argument
is
made
today
that
there
is
no
presumption
accompanying
the
enactment
of
this
ordinance
because
it
is
a
prohibitory
one.
i
pause
only
to
read
the
simple
sentence
from
the
powell
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
which
involved
the
total
disability
to
manufacture
(inaudible)
in
which
this
court
said
of
a
totally
prohibitory
statute,
“every
possible
presumption
in
favor
of
the
validity
of
the
statute
and
is
in
favor
the
validity
of
the
statute,”
and
this
continues
until
the
contrary
shown
beyond
a
rational
doubt.
now,
the
argument
is
made
here
today
that
there
were
drainage
conferences.
again,
the
court
will
not
quite
look
in
vain
for
competent
--
comprehensible
testimony
of
that
conferred
--
drainage
conferences
but
will
find
these
alleged
conferences
in
colloquies
and
then
openings
in
the
record,
and
of
course
even
if
they
were,
our
position
is
that
the
town
does
not
have
to
pay
the
price
on
the
exercise,
the
legitimate
exercise
of
a
police
power.
it
does
not
have
to
pay
the
price
of
buy-in
all
of
this,
a
public
nuisance
and
a
threat
to
the
community.
the
suggestion
has
made
again
in
counsel's
brief
and
in
his
oral
argument
that
we
did
not
affirmatively
prove
that
this
was
a
nuisance.
we
point
out
that
this
burden
traditionally
does
not
belong
to
us
and
that
the
burden
of
establishing
that
the
statute,
the
ordinance
is
itself
unreasonable
belongs
to
the
assailant
who
attacks
it.
now,
the
trial
court
held
in
its
opinion
that
there
was
no
qualitative
evidence
addressed
to
the
unreasonableness
of
this
ordinance
and
on
this
argument,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
has
been
a
concession
that
there
was
at
least
a
legitimate
area
of
legislation
when
in
1945,
the
three
towns,
these
one
included
addressed
itself
to
the
dangers,
the
three-fold
dangers
which
faced
their
communities.
actually
as
i
understand
the
argument
of
the
appellant's
here
today,
it
is
like
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
saxl
case
which
we
cite
on
our
brief
where
they
do
not
question
the
power
to
legislate
in
this
field,
but
where
they
complain
that
the
steps
that
we
have
taken
are
not
--
are
not
determinative
of
the
best
legislative
judgment.
the
town,
the
appellant
cites
pennsylvania
against
maine.
i
think
that
this
is
the
only
case
in
which
they
really
rely
and
the
case
itself
i
think
is
totally
distinguishable.
mr.
justice
holmes
put
the
principal
reliance
on
the
case
on
the
two-fold
aspect
that
it
involves
a
private
wrong
and
that
it
involve
the
impairment
of
a
contract.
on
the
issue
of
res
judicata
this
question,
the
impairment
of
the
judgment
was
raised
at
the
subsequent
action
which
was
commenced
under
this
ordinance
and
which
is
--
which
as
counsel
in
the
brief
show
had
been
discontinued.
when
the
question
was
raised
under
the
prior
enforcement
attempt
under
this
ordinance,
the
same
argument
was
made
namely,
that
the
1956
judgment
giving
them
their
vested
right
to
continue
this
prior
nonconforming
use
was
res
judicata
and
the
supreme
court
held
in
an
opinion
the
text
that
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
that
the
judgment
in
the
nonconforming
use
case
had
no
applicability.
it
did
not
constitute
both,
in
this
case
in
which
the
issues
were
essentially
different
ones
although
the
parties
were
the
same.
the
question
was
asked
whether
--
by
mr.
justice
black
whether
this
judgment
before
this
court
requires
refill
and
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
black
is
emphatically
no.
the
judgment
contains
no
affirmative
mandate
requiring
refill.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
the
injunction
mr.
justice
harlan
provides
that
they
are
enjoined
from
further
operations
at
the
premises
until
they
do
two
things,
until
they
obtain
a
permit
which
is
required
in
ordinance
number
16
and
until
they
cure
the
violations.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
yes
it
is
your
honor.
i
don't
have
the
page
before
me
but
i
believe
that
you
are
looking
at
the
judgment.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
now,
if
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
you
--
mr.
justice
whittaker,
if
you
please,
this
ordinance,
this
is
the
decretal
paragraph
does
not
affirmatively
mandate
them
to
(inaudible)
and
refill
the
pit.
that
mandate
is
interwoven
in
that
decretal
paragraph
requiring
the
correction
of
all
these
violations
as
a
condition
precedent
to
further
operations
of
the
pit.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
it
includes
filling
it
not
affirmatively
and
independently
of
this
judgment.
it
includes
refilling
it
mr.
chief
justice,
if
they
should
again
endeavor
to
commence
operations
at
the
pit.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
correct
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
they've
not
suggested
mr.
justice
whittaker
in
--
in
their
case
and
the
trial
court
pointed
this
out
that
there
is
no
other
available
use
for
this
property.
there
is
no
testimony
whatsoever
that
this
property
cannot
be
equipped
to
some
other
valuable
available
use,
and
the
under
new
york
cases
cited
one
by
them
and
one
by
us,
the
auburn
bay
case
and
the
city
of
yonkers
against
rentways
inc.
the
court
of
appeals
is
consistently
held
that
this
is
affirmative
burden
which
the
assailant
carries
and
which
he
must
discharge
and
if
the
court
itself
will
not
sit
to
open
and
interpolate
evidence
and
supply
the
missing
evidence.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
if
mr.
justice
--
if
judge
burke
meant
by
that
sentence
that
there
was
no
prohibition
of
wet
or
underwater
digging,
he
was
obviously
incorrect.
as
i
read
that
sentence
in
the
opinion
he
was
addressing
himself
to
this
proposition
that
this
is
not
a
totally
prohibitory
statute
that
it
permits
and
even
in
this
case
mr.
justice
whittaker,
the
excavations
of
the
remaining
18
acres
at
the
premises
and
that
is
how
i
read
that
sentence.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
they
could
not.
the
refill
requirement
makes
them
--
mandates
them
to
fill
a
pit
before
they
commence
the
operations.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
that's
correct,
but
mr.
justice
whittaker,
there
is
nothing
the
record
to
show
either
the
course
of
refill
or
assuming
it
to
be
substantial,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
once
refill
was
made
the
property
then
would
not
have
a
valuable
use
and
a
value
in
fact.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
well,
we
submit
that
as
in
the
mugler
case
spirituous
liquors
were
held
to
be
proscribable
and
in
powell
where
olio
was
proscribed
and
in
piers,
these
cases
we've
cited
in
our
brief
where
the
storage
of
oil
cans
was
proscribed
and
in
reinman
where
a
livery
stable
was
proscribed
and
in
hadacheck
where
mining
--
where
manufacture
of
bricks
was
proscribed
that
this
is
not
constitutionally
prohibitive
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
because
there
is
a
nuisance
which
this
community
has
the
power
to
regulate
and
this
statute
with
its
regulatory
provisions
as
the
trial
court
held
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
is
directed
to
the
regulation
of
the
--
of
the
premises.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
i
think
--
i
think,
excuse
me.
i
think
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
judge
van
voorhis
pointed
out
in
this
case
as
he
did
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
harbison
case
which
is
has
been
mentioned
that
the
people
here
came
to
the
community
that
the
nuisance,
although
he
wouldn't
consider
it's
a
nuisance,
he
said
that
i
consider
it
the
contrary,
did
not
come
to
the
community,
but
we
do
not
see
that
that
fact
it
could
be
assumed
would
constitute
a
lack
of
due
process
in
the
enforcement
and
enactment
on
this
regulation
--
of
this
regulatory
ordinance
which
permits
these
--
permits
these
defendants
to
operate
and
on
this
record
in
which
there
appears
absolutely
no
confiscation
in
the
proof.
there
are
two
other
questions.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
mr.
justice
black,
if
you
use
confiscation
in
that
sense,
it
is
confiscation
because
he
can
no
longer
dig.
i
do
not
question
that.
i'm
using
it
in
a
appropriate
sense
in
which
the
word
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
it's
taking
away
the
right
because
there
is
no
question
about
it.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
if
it
was
a
right.
there
is
no
question
about
it
that
under
4
(h)
that
there
cannot
be
any
further
wet
mining.
there
are
two
questions
which
remain
no
longer.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
court
recessed
yesterday,
i
had
been
addressing
myself
to
the
refill
provision,
particularly
in
response
to
questions
addressed
to
me
by
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i
stated
that
section
4
(a)
of
the
ordinance
requires
refill,
4
(j).
and
i
state
also
today
that
in
addition
to
that
reclaimant
of
refill
there
are
criminal
sanctions.
now,
i
would
state
emphatically
this
morning
to
the
court
as
we
have
in
the
briefs
that
neither
the
refill
provision
nor
the
criminal
sanctions
is
before
the
court.
the
judgment
before
the
court
contains
no
affirmative
mandate
with
respect
to
refill
and
it
is
true
that
the
question
would
become
a
right
one
were
the
appellants
to
endeavor
to
utilize
the
remaining
18
acres
of
land.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
it's
on
page
12,
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
mr.
justice
harlan.
now,
if
the
--
if
the
appellants
consistent
with
their
argument
that
there
is
nothing
left
to
excavate
on
the
18
acres,
do
not
endeavor
to
mine
there,
then
plainly
there
is
no
reclaimant
so
far
as
this
judgment
is
concerned
that
they
refill.
the
refill
provision
we
urge
is
a
sensible
one
particularly
so
far
as
new
pits
are
concerned.
it
was
calculated
to
guarantee
that
when
deep
excavations
in
the
ground
be
made,
those
excavations
be
on
the
abandonment
of
the
excavation
return
to
(inaudible)
this
has
the
--
obvious
and
at
one
statutory
purpose
of
eliminating
the
remaining
deep
pits
in
the
ground.
we
say
that
its
sensible
even
here
and
as
i
urged
yesterday
that
while
at
first
blush,
it
may
be
a
harsh
reclaimant.
if
it
be
complied
with,
nonetheless,
there
would
be
a
very
substantial
value
far
in
excess
of
the
cost
of
refill
once
the
provision
had
been
complied
with.
the
court
may
say
indeed
now
that
this
is
an
oppressive,
an
oppressive
--
or
onerous
reclaimant.
if
it
is,
i
point
to
section
11
of
the
ordinance
which
contains
a
separability
provision.
and
i
respectfully
urged
that
should
the
court
reach
the
conclusion
that
refill
constitutes
an
oppressive
reclaimant
that
the
ordinance
be
saved
within
the
cases
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
i
--
also
before
the
conclusion
of
my
argument
had
endeavored
to
address
myself
to
a
question
which
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
me
when
he
asked
if
the
pit
was
here
before
the
community
was
urbanized.
and
i
answered
correctly
that
the
pit
was
in
fact
there.
while
it
was
there,
it
was
there
as
the
record
shows
that
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
as
a
small
excavation
with
some
wood
surely
in
1930
not
as
--
has
been
urged
as
a
20-acre-lake
with
an
average
depth
of
25
feet.
the
point
is
that
as
nassau
county
and
particularly
this
township
grew
from
1929
to
the
most
populous
town
in
america
today.
the
community
grew
with
it.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
there
are
statistics
which
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
no,
the
most
populated,
if
your
honor
please.
the
population
in
excess
of
1,000,000
people
in
--
in
this
township.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
town.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
coming
from
new
york,
i
should've
known
better
than
that.
now,
the
question
which
u.s.
was
surely
a
pertinent
one
so
far
as
the
zoning
case
is
concerned.
thus,
it
was
so
in
harbison
which
the
--
on
which
the
appellants
relied.
but
in
a
nuisance
case
especially
where
the
nuisance
and
the
community
grow
together,
it
is
not
a
relevant
consideration.
otherwise,
were
this
not
so,
there
would
be
no
conceivable
limit,
no
control
of
the
limit
of
the
appellants'
pit.
in
this
case,
however,
obnoxious
it
be,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenters
in
the
harbison
case
specifically
point
it
out
that
there
was
no
nuisance
in
that
case.
and
they
as
much
as
said
that
this
consideration,
the
community
coming
to
the
business
activity
would
have
no
relevancy
with
that
activity
as
here,
constituted
a
noxious
use
or
a
hung
to
the
community
in
brief
a
nuisance.
there
was
a
brewery
in
mugler
long
before
the
kansas
statute
outlawed
the
manufacturer
possession
and
sale
of
spirituous
liquors.
in
summary,
in
the
remaining
few
minutes,
i
would
state
again
that
this
ordinance
is
attended
with
the
traditional
presumption
of
constitutionality.
i
would
point
to
the
record
and
to
the
trial
court's
determination
that
in
this
regard
there
was
an
object,
a
failure
of
proof
by
the
appellants
addressed
to
the
unreasonableness
of
the
ordinance.
i
would
point
to
the
trial
court's
determination
on
this
record
that
even
without
the
presumption;
these
provisions
of
the
ordinance
were
eminently
suited
for
the
curtailment
of
the
triple
threat
posed
by
the
dangers
to
this
community
from
ground
and
from
surrounding
homes
caving
in
and
from
the
penetration
of
he
water
table.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
well,
if
the
court
please.
in
our
brief,
we
--
in
our
oral
argument
yesterday,
we
endeavored
to
distinguish
it
on
the
grounds
that
mr.
justice
holmes
treated
it
principally
on
the
contract
basis
as
an
impairment
of
contract.
and
i
observed
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
that
response
does
not
evoke
an
immediate
satisfaction
from
you.
while
it
may
not
be
appropriate
appellate
argument
to
point
to
holmes
--
on
holmes,
on
november
26,
1922,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
mr.
pollack
which
we
cited
to
one
of
the
courts
below,
to
judge
pollack,
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
the
principal
trapped
of
his
argument
in
mahon
was
just
this
very
distinction
to
which
we
point
namely
the
impairment
of
a
contract.
there
would
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
well,
if
your
honor
please
--
if
your
honor
please,
mr.
justice
holmes,
in
addition
to
placing
the
main
part
of
his
decision
as
he
wrote
to
pollack,
on
the
--
on
the
impairment
of
contract
aspect
was
very
clear
in
his
opinion
in
pointing
out
that
that
there
was
the
element
of
personal
safety
was
not
reasonably
legislated
by
the
pennsylvania
legislature.
john
w.
davis
who
argued
the
case
before
this
court
and
i
read
his
brief,
argued
principally
--
again
the
contract
question
and
he
pointed
out
that
contemporaneously
with
the
enactment
of
the
--
of
the
coal
act
in
pennsylvania.
there
was
a
foul
act
which
permitted
the
coal
miners
to
--
the
mining
companies
to
escape
the
impact
of
the
ordinance
by
the
payment
of
dollar
money.
he
also
pointed
out
in
his
--
and
also
pointed
out
in
his
decision
that
the
statute
did
not
apply
either
to
the
owners
of
the
first
estate
and
the
third
estate.
and
mr.
justice
holmes
said
plainly
this
was
not
a
safety
measure.
this
is
the
way
we
read
the
case.
i
would
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
well,
mr.
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
his
dissent
in
the
opinion
also
addressed
himself
to
the
impropriety
of
the
legislative
means
in
that
case
addressing
himself
as
did
--
mr.
just
--
as
to
john
w.
davis
to
the
simple
measure
of
writing
a
letter,
a
traditional
system
which
had
obtained
in
the
anthracite
country
before
that.
in
--
sir?
mr.
william
c.
mattison
yes,
sir.
but
in
--
mr.
justice
whittaker,
at
the
very
least
the
enforcement
of
the
judgment
before
this
court
in
its
present
posture
would
prevent
the
further
excavation
and
the
further
enlargement
of
the
crater
at
the
lake
and
to
that
extent
at
least,
it
would
prevent
the
enlargement
of
the
nuisance.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
i
--
there
was
no
specific
--
there
were
no
findings
of
fact
in
the
case
as
we
read
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court.
the
lake
itself
was
not
found
to
be
a
nuisance
but
the
totality
of
the
considerations,
namely,
the
width
of
the
burn,
the
depth
of
the
water,
the
angle
of
slope.
all
of
these
violations
of
the
ordinance,
in
some,
constituted
a
nuisance,
a
danger
to
this
community.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
the
trial
court
said
that
the
--
that
on
the
proof,
the
ordinance
was
eminently
suitable
to
the
curtailment
of
the
obvious
dangers
which
he
enumerated
and
those
were
the
dangers
that
we've
urged
in
this
argument.
threats
and
cave-ins
and
falls.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
it
would
be
lessened,
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
sense
that
i've
already
endeavored
to
answer
your
question
that
it
at
least
is
a
cessation
of
the
enlargement
of
this
nuisance.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
it
would
not
be
an
elimination
of
the
nuisance,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
if
it
is
a
nuisance
which
we
contend
it
this.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
that's
correct.
of
course,
what
ultimately
would
happen
with
the
property
is
a
question
which
is
not
in
the
record.
it
may
well
be
that
it
would
be
economically
feasible
for
the
appellants
to
fill
the
property
in.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
either
--
that
the
18
acres
cannot
possibly
be
mined.
and
there
is
no
suggestion
in
brief
that
there
is
no
other
profitable
use
for
the
property.
on
the
argument
yesterday,
there
is
one
more
further
provision
to
which
the
trial
court
addressed
itself
and
that
was
the
concrete
curb
which
the
ordinance
requires
be
erected
under
the
fence
to
prevent
children
burrowing
from
beneath.
there
were
holes
found
in
this
fence
on
the
examination
and
the
evidence
which
was
introduced
at
the
trial.
for
all
these
considerations,
if
it
please
the
court,
and
particularly
the
allusion
yesterday
of
counsel
to
the
statistics
on
drowning
in
new
york
city.
we
understand
that,
as
we
have
throughout
this
argument
and
the
briefs
that
there
has
been
a
concession
of
our
town
board
to
legislate
in
this
area.
and
we
find
that
the
argument
of
the
appellants
is
simply
that
they
questioned
the
reason
--
reasonableness
and
the
extent
of
the
legislative
process,
questions
which
we
think
have
been
effectively
disposed
off
in
the
cases
we
have
cited.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
say
very
briefly,
i
know
i
have
short
time,
that
there
is
no
--
i
say
this
categorically,
there
was
no
proof
in
this
record
of
any
nuisance.
you
remember
the
dissenting
judge,
the
three
dissenting
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
was
a
concession
that
was
no
--
of
no
nuisance.
i
--
i'm
not
even
relying
--
well,
i
can
rely
on
the
concession.
it's
noted
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
but
i
say
categorically,
definitely,
unconditionally,
there
is
not
a
word
of
nuisance
in
this
case.
the
town's
case
consisted
of
two
witnesses
put
on
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial.
one
witness
said
we
didn't
get
a
permit.
and
i
tell
your
honor,
of
course
we
can't
get
a
permit.
of
course
we
cannot
comply
with
this
statute.
we
--
the
only
way
we
can
comply
with
the
statute
is
by
not
excavating.
the
next
witness
said
there
are
8800
of
people
living
in
the
neighborhood,
period.
that's
the
plaintiff's
case.
now
where
is
the
proof
of
nuisance?
mr.
william
c.
mattison
right.
excuse
me.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
well,
this
judgment
says
that
we
have
violated
it
in
various
ways
because
we
are
digging
under
water,
which
we
admit
that
we
haven't
filled
it
up.
now,
nuisance
hasn't
come
into
this
case.
that's
the
reason
those
decisions
which
were
termed
extreme
cases
and
the
decision
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
this
actual
case
don't
apply
here
at
all
because
in
every
one
of
those
case
as
reinman,
there
was
no
proof
of
nuisance.
furthermore,
may
i
call
your
attention
to
the
hadacheck
case
because
that
hadacheck
case
decided
by
this
court
said
the
brick
making
in
that
particular
case,
under
that
proof
was
nuisance.
but
they
said
--
this
court
said
expressly,
“we
don't
say
that
the
taking
of
the
clay
from
the
ground
could
be
prohibited.
we
reserved
that
question.”
that
question
came
up
in
1923
in
the
eric
(ph)
case
decided
by
the
circuit
court,
sixth
circuit
court.
and
they
specifically
said
that
the
question
that
was
reserved
on
the
hadacheck
case
by
this
court
is
now
decided
and
you
cannot
prohibit
the
taking
of
the
stuff
from
the
earth
itself.
i
call
your
attention
in
that
--
at
that
point
the
brief
filed
by
the
amicus
curiae
of
the
association
of
gravel
operators.
and
--
and
it
shows
that
the
problem
we
have
here
extends
throughout
the
united
states
and
they've
covered
in
greater
detail
and
i
have
would
(inaudible)
--
with
respect
to
natural
resources.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
unless
--
that's
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
that's
the
most
i'd
say,
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
that's
the
least?
yes,
i
see
your
context.
yes,
that's
the
least
you
can
do.
you've
got
to
show
the
nuisance
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
if
these
were
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
well,
in
most
extreme
cases
of
those
decide
--
is
the
reinman
case,
those
cases
which
says
that
you
--
if
you
have
a
nuisance
then
you
can
do
something
under
your
police
power.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
you
don't
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
you
can
--
of
course
the
--
the
proof
in
this
case
or
the
facts
in
this
case
is
that
even
though
--
facts
in
this
case
are,
that
even
though
this
town
has
been
trying
to
get
rid
of
our
operations.
they
never
went
into
court
on
a
common-law
nuisance,
very
simple
matter
if
they
thought
there
was
any
nuisance.
in
the
1956
litigation
which
ended
up
with
the
decree
that
we
are
not
--
that
we
have
a
non-conforming
use
which
is
wiped
out
by
this
ordinance.
they
could've
proved
common-law
nuisance
there.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
no.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
i
have
two
other
observations
taking
a
half-minute,
if
your
honor
please.
number
one,
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
value,
in
this
record,
there
--
the
judge
allowed
in
the
assessment
of
$66,000
and
i
have
a
case
here,
it's
not
--
it's
not
contested
by
my
friend
that
nassau
county
real
property
values
are
assessed
at
just
one-third
of
the
real
property
value.
so
if
you
multiply
it
by
three,
you
got
a
value
here
of
our
property
of
a
$198,000
plus
the
fact
that
there
was
admitted
in
the
evidence
the
testimony
in
the
previous
case
which
showed
that
our
--
we
have
$200,000
gross
business
at
the
time
that
we
were
stopped
here.
furthermore,
there
was
$241,000
of
equipment,
an
investment
in
our
property
here.
this
is
all
been
wiped-out.
and
finally,
i
say
to
your
honor
--
if
your
honor
please,
that
when
you
take
the
fine
of
$500
and
each
week
is
one
violation,
i
multiplied
the
weeks
by
the
$500.
and
we
owe
these
people
on
this
judgment.
they
can
go
on
a
court
tomorrow
and
get
a
judgment
against
such
for
$81,000
because
for
the
last
three
years
we
have
not
filled
this
pit.
i
hesitate
to
say
what
the
penalty
is.
i'm
talking
about
maximum
penalty
of
six
months
for
each
week.
i
think
--
i
don't
know.
incidentally,
if
your
honors
please,
these
people
didn't
allow
us
to
even
get
a
temporary
stay
to
continue
until
that
court
passed
upon
--
i'm
talking
about
appellate
court,
passed
upon
this
thing.
you
see
it's
--
at
this
juncture
--
four-to-three
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
so
the
--
the
real
--
the
realty,
that
real
possibility
of
these
people
fining
us
$81,000
is
a
real
possibility.
there's
nothing
ephemeral
about
it.
thank
you
sir.
