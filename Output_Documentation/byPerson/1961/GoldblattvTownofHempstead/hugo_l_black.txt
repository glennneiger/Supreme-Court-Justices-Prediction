justice

black
is
that
phase
of
the
case
necessarily
before
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
enforcement
provided
for
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
a
threat
to
enforce
the
criminal
part
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
injunction,
do
they
seek
a
mandatory
injunction
to
tell
you
to
refill
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
it
say
you
have
to
refill
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
asking
the
question
on
the
assumption
that
there
might
be
a
possibility
the
ordinance
would
be
valid
insofar
as
it
looks
to
the
future,
but
might
not
be
valid
in
so
far
is
it
compels
you
to
spend
the
million
dollars?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
not
--
that
--
i
said
--
i
didn't
say
it
could
be
nor
did
i
say
i
would
favor
it.
i
simply
suggested
that
it
might
be
possible
the
act
would
be
constitutional
in
aspect
in
which
it
barred
digging
here
for
the
future
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
but
might
not
be
constitutional
in
the
aspect
in
which
it
sought
to
compel
you
to
pay
out
money,
to
repair
something
which
was
legal
when
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
(inaudible),
you
suggest
that,
it
reminds
me
that
the
--
probably
some
difference
in
what
provision
of
the
constitution
are
you
relying
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
â€“
does
your
argument
amount
to
this?
i
want
to
get
to
as
near
as
i
can
and
(inaudible)
that
new
york
city
desired
did
not
pass
the
law
which
provided
that
there
should
be
no
artificial
lakes
can
25
feet
or
eight
feet
deep
in
certain
sizes
in
the
period
in
anywhere
in
the
city?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
said
that
just
couldn't
be
any
under
town.
you're
saying
they
can't
pass
a
law
like
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
just
trying
to
get
a
thought
that
maybe
your
argument
could
but
as
i
understand
it,
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
town
cannot
pass
a
law
which
prohibits
artificial
lake
within
its
boundary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
taking
people's
property
without
due
process
of
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
other
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
construction
is
that
it
orders
them
not
to
do
anymore
work
there
unless
they
refill
the
pits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
(inaudible),
would
it
not
if
you
called
confiscation,
depriving
a
man
and
the
right
to
use
his
property
for
the
purpose
for
which
he
wants
to
use
it,
which
is
to
dig
underneath
the
water.
justice
hugo
l.
black
although,
it's
taking
away
that
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
was
a
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
contend
while
it
would
not
eliminate
the
danger
it
would
prevent
its
spread.
