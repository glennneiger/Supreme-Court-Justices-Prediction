what
the
court
of
appeals
meant
by
the
statement
on
page
200
of
the
record,
neither
the
injunction
granted
nor
the
ordinance
proscribes
any
future
excavation.
the
injunction
merely
conditions
future
operations
upon
the
issues
of
a
permit
from
the
town
and
the
corrections
of
certain
violations
of
the
ordinance.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
could
they
under
the
decretal
provisions
of
paragraph
e
on
page
14
operate
mine,
if
i
may
use
that
word,
a
remaining
18
acres
unless
and
until
they
had
first
filled
the
pit?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
obviously,
you
couldn't
mine
under
the
refill
because
you
would
then
be
undoing
what
you
were
required
in
the
first
place
to
do,
wouldn't
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
this
then
brings
us
to
the
question
of
whether
this
is
really
regulation
or
appropriation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
--
how
would
enforcement
of
the
present
judgment
would
simply
suspends
further
mining
affect
public
safety
with
the
lake
and
the
physical
conditions
as
they
are
would
remain
as
they
are,
would
they
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
was
--
was
the
--
the
lake
itself
bound
to
be
a
nuisance?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
the
peril
to
life
be
lessened
by
this
decree?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
not
an
elimination
of
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
it
is
a
nuisance?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
even
if
there
was
a
nuisance
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
--
i
like
to
know
the
--
does
this
judgment
abate
it?
