what
do
you
do
with
the
mahon
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
whole
tenor
of
the
opinion
is
that
if
you
take
--
if
you
take
too
much,
you
have
to
pay
for
it
under
the
compensation
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
hard
--
pretty
hard
to
say
all
this
safety
measure,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
has
caved
--
was
caving
in
that's
why
the
coal
act
was
passed
in
pennsylvania.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
assume
--
does
your
argument
assume
that
there
cannot
be
a
limitation
of
the
use
of
private
property
under
the
constitution
unless
you
find
a
common-law
nuisance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
find
a
common-law
nuisance
in
order
to
--
is
that
the
only
basis
on
which
the
state
can
limit,
the
use
--
the
use
of
private
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
say
that's
the
least.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
i
mean,
if
you
got
that
much
then
you
don't
need
anymore.
you
don't
need
any
constitution.
you
don't
need
any
--
all
this
argument.
a
common-law
nuisance
is
debatable
as
a
common-law
nuisance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
here
is
what
is
the
state's
so-called
police
power
wholly
apart
from
the
existence
of
a
nuisance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
have
a
nuisance,
you
need
nothing
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
said
once
about
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
questioning
your
position
that
there
was
no
nuisance.
but
even
assuming
it,
the
argument
doesn't
stop
that
there
because
there's
no
common-law
nuisance.
therefore
the
argument
is,
there's
no
state
power
to
regulate
the
mischievous
use
of
property
in
relation
to
the
context
of
that
society.
