mr.
john
l.
laskey
justice
black,
mr.
justices.
we
differ
--
the
government's
position
as
to
what
is
the
distinguishing
criteria
which
terminates
the
exemption.
we
say
that
it
is
the
only
thing
which
is
exempted
is
the
payment
of
benefit
and
when
the
moneys,
be
it
still
in
the
form
of
money
or
whether
it
be
transferred
into
some
other
form,
bank
account
shares
or
any
other
forms.
when
it
ceases
to
have
the
character
of
a
payment,
it
has
lost
its
exemption
because
that
exemption
was
only
extended
by
the
statute
to
the
payment.
but
the
government
would
read
that
that
benefits
acquired
from
the
payment
of
veterans'
disability
checks
shall
be
examined.
i
do
not
read
the
statute
in
that
like.
i
would
think
we
should
approach
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
record
made
in
the
lower
court.
in
that
record,
we
were
dealing
only
with
two
building
--
one
building
and
loan
account
and
one
savings
and
loan
account
for
the
purposes
of
our
considerations
that
there
is
no
distinction
in
the
building
and
loan
and
the
savings
and
loan
account,
they're
governed
by
the
same
author;
same
regulations.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
systematic
deposit
of
the
veterans'
benefit
checks
in
a
certain
account
or
in
the
accounts
which
were
attached.
the
record
will
show
from
the
committee's
account
which
appears
at
page
15
of
the
record
and
on
some
of
the
following
pages
that
the
regular
monthly
disability
checks
in
the
amount
of
$225
were
systematically
deposited
in
the
national
bank
checking
account.
an
account
not
here
before
the
court
which
was
attached
but
as
to
which
we
are
raising
no
question.
the
committee's
account
further
shows
that
at
various
times
but
on
no
fixed
pattern,
funds
were
transferred
from
that
account
in
a
lump
sum
$3000
in
one
case,
$2000
in
other
and
$1000
figures
in
others,
incidentally,
figures
which
are
not
consistent
with
an
accumulation
only
of
the
payments
or
rather
a
payment
deficit
divisible
into
that
sum
which
it
did
not.
but
those
funds
were
transferred.
when
they
reached
the
hands
of
the
garnishee
where
they
were
attached,
they
were
not
payments
of
veterans'
benefits.
they
were
a
payment
from
the
veterans'
checking
account
and
were
an
investment
by
the
veterans
who
bought
the
accrual
of
interest.
indeed,
one
item
with
$2000
had
been
withdrawn
from
the
building
and
loan
account,
placed
back
in
the
checking
account
in
anticipation
of
the
--
of
its
use
for
payments
of
expert
witnesses
at
the
trial
and
then
when
that
was
--
this
necessity
was
dispensed
with,
it
was
again
transferred
to
the
building
and
loan
account.
could
it
be
said
that
that
transfer
of
that
$2000
back
again
to
the
building
and
loan
account
and
not
--
it
then
still
retained
as
a
character
as
the
payment
which
had
been
an
exempted
and
we
submit
that
it
could
not.
the
distinction
between
the
relationships
between
depositors
in
building
and
loan
accounts
and
the
relationship
between
depositors
and
checking
accounts
and
bank
--
and
bank
accounts
of
the
checking
account
nature
is
a
substantial
and
real
one.
and
in
order
to
accomplish
the
results
sought
by
the
government
and
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
it
is
necessary
to
rewrite
the
contract
which
was
entered
into
between
of
the
person
who
deposited
--
the
veteran
who
deposited
--
deposited
the
funds
in
a
building
and
loan
or
savings
and
loan
account
and
--
and
that
institution.
to
carry
that
argument;
the
government's
argument
and
the
petitioner's
argument
to
its
logical
extension
would
not
only
rewrite
the
account
for
the
benefit
of
the
veteran
and
at
the
prejudice
of
the
building
and
loan
or
savings
and
loan
association
but
would
also
provide
the
means
of
a
shop
an
unfair
and
an
equitable
discrimination
between
those
depositors
in
the
building
and
loan
organizations
who
were
veterans
and
those
who
were
not
because
if
you
are
to
exempt
those
funds
from
attachment
by
a
judgment
creditors,
you
would
necessarily
have
to
exempt
them
from
any
other
form
of
execution
described
in
the
statute
either
equitable
or
legal.
so,
i
think
we
all
know
that
all
building
and
loan
associations
are
not
federally
insured
or
are
not
properly
managed.
some
have
come
into
difficulties
and
some
in
this
immediate
area
are
even
now
in
the
hands
of
receivers.
the
government's
position
would
require
that
depositors
in
that
account
in
those
associ
--
associations
would
be
treated
differently.
veterans'
accounts
would
be
exempt
but
the
other
depositors
would
have
to
bear
the
full
burden
of
any
loss
because
if
the
veterans
accounted
the
exempt
from
attachment
by
a
judgment
creditor,
it
would
be
exempt
from
seizure
by
the
receiver
or
the
--
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
or
any
other
person
seeking
to
enforce
and
carry
out
the
liquidation
or
the
salvation
of
that
company.
mr.
john
l.
laskey
i
would
like
to
deal
for
a
moment
with
the
government's
argument
for
the
widows
and
children
as
i
understood
it.
at
page
17
of
their
brief
that
mr.
laughlin
has
argued,
urges
that
a
woman
receiving
widow's
benefit
on
the
veterans
legislation
must
keep
those
moneys
perhaps
intended
as
a
source
of
maintenance
and
independence
in
later
life
either
on
her
person
or
under
her
rule.
the
same
type
of
an
argument
was
made
with
respect
to
a
child.
i
submit
that
that
is
vicious
argument
that
you
do
not
find
in
the
statute,
any
intention
to
exempt
anything
except
the
payment
that
the
statute
--
it
has
a
limited
duration.
i
find
nothing
in
the
statute
which
says
that
a
veteran
or
a
veteran's
widow
or
a
veterans'
child
could
live
on
credit
putting
the
veteran's
payments
in
a
building
and
loan
account
and
the
judgment
proof
for
necessities
bought
on
credit
that
would
follow.
the
government
states
that
its
position
here
is
consistent
with
that
taken
in
the
wisconsin
bankers
case.
i
do
not
concede
that
that
is
the
fact.
i
say
in
their
brief
in
his
case,
that
the
only
real
difference
between
a
savings
account
depositor
and
here
we
do
not
have
a
savings
account
depositor
but
i
--
i
--
our
position
would
be
the
same
in
any
event
and
the
checking
account
depositor
are
that
the
former
draw
the
little
interest
or
dividend
on
his
account
and
has
to
present
his
passbook.
these
minimal
differences
are
not,
we
submit,
sufficient
to
deprive
benefits
proceeds
of
their
identity
when
placed
in
a
savings
account.
again
at
page
25,
they
say
the
differences
between
these
two
types
of
accounts,
however,
are
technical
and
legal
and
are
far
outweighed
by
their
similarities
when
the
issue
is
viewed
in
the
perspec
--
perspective
of
the
benign
legislative
purpose
of
this
act.
however,
in
arguing
the
congress
with
the
position
which
they
take
here
in
their
brief
on
--
an
--
an
objection
to
the
application
for
certiorari
in
the
wisconsin
bankers
case,
they
say,
at
page
7
of
their
brief
in
that
case,
“from
these
regulatory
provisions,
it
is
clear
that
whatever
their
similarities
in
name
and
practice
and
practical
operations
of
the
savings
accounts
authorized
by
the
regulations
are
not
the
legal
counterpart
of
a
deposit
in
a
bank
and
the
relationship
of
holders
to
those
savings
accounts
to
the
association
is
significantly
different
from
the
debtor-creditor
relationship
that
exist
between
a
depositor
and
a
bank.”
they
go
on
to
say
at
the
footer
that
same
page,
“unlike
petitioners,
depositors
however,
are
members
of
an
association
holding
savings
account
paid
for
a
share
of
capital
that
section
5
(b)
require
and
though
they
may
withdraw
their
interest,
they
are
subject
to
a
waiting
period
as
well
as
a
proration
of
funds
in
the
event
of
an
emergency.
they
are
share
owners
not
depositors.”
in
concluding,
they
say
our
position
is
that
the
challenge
regulations
create
procedures
and
legal
interest
significantly
different
in
legal
contemplation
from
the
type
of
deposits
proscribed
by
section
5
of
the
home
owners'
loan
act.
mr.
john
l.
laskey
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon?
mr.
john
l.
laskey
that
was
filed
at
the
--
the
wisconsin
bankers
case
was
filed
on
november
15th,
1961.
it
was
decided
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
on
the
same
day
to
this
case.
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
the
wisconsin
bankers
case,
after
the
opposition
by
the
government
had
granted
its
appeal.
the
home
owners'
regulations
had
clearly
set
forth
the
legal
effects
of
the
relationships
between
the
depositors;
be
they
veteran
or
non-veteran
and
be
they
veteran
incompetent
or
veterans
who
are
competent.
they
set
them
forth
clearly
and
they
specified
that
they
are
owners
of
share;
benefit
share,
share
interest;
a
capital
interest
in
the
organization.
they
have
voting
interests,
they
have
other
interest
too
incidentally,
as
they
aid
in
acquiring
traditional
capital
accounts.
the
institutions
involved
here
and
many
others
of
like-nature,
have
made
a
practice
of
honoring
withdrawals
at
the
same
time
they
are
made
but
that
does
not
change
the
legal
effect
or
the
legal
relationship
between
the
parties.
those
regulations
are
set
forth
at
page
18
and
19
of
our
brief.
mr.
john
l.
laskey
yes
sir.
we
started
at
little
prior
to
that
on
page
--
page
17,
they
began
by
saying,
"in
order
to
provide
local
mutual
thrift
institutions
in
which
people
may
invest
their
funds,"
and
they
go
on,
"they
know
deposits
shall
be
accepted.
"that's
what
the
wisconsin
bankers
association
is
complaining
about
that
they
were
in
fact
deposits,
the
government
there
said,
"no,
they
were
not
deposits,
they
were
share
interest."
and
they
defined
as
the
savings
account,
under
the
building
and
loan
and
--
and
savings
and
loan
organization.they
defined
ad
--
admitting
the
monetary
interest
of
the
hol
--
holder
thereof
in
the
capital
of
a
federal
association.
and
again,
on
page
19,
was
the
--
"the
requirements
with
regard
to
withdrawals
that
the
association
shall
then
pay
all
withdrawals
requested
in
accordance
with
such
methods
and
procedures
as
to
amounts
and
allotment
of
funds
as
to
such
purposes
that

be
provided
in

board

for
which
application
for
withdrawal
has
been
made
shall
remain

accounts
until
paid
and
shall
not
become
creditors.
the
situation
which
the
government
would
rewrite
and
recast
that
it
would
permit
necessarily
freedom
of
withdrawal
of
veterans'
funds
since
it's
quid
pro
quo."
if
the
exception
is
extended,
it
must
be
extended
with
prescription
against
seizure
of
any
kind,
legal
or
equitable.
set
forth
in
the
record,
the
particular
exemplifications
of
those
provisions
in
this
case.
we
ran
into
a
little
printing
difficulty
not
through
the
court's
regular
printer
but
to
our
own
and
possibly
to
our
method
of
submitting
our
material
to
him.
we
had
intended
to
set
out
the
charter
and
bylaws
of
the
columbia
federal
savings
and
loan
association
in
order
as
paginated
in
their
pamphlet.
the
pagination
is
set
forth
in
the
transcript
of
records
beginning
at
page
37
and
--
and
44
--
through
44
is
not
consistent
and
we
accordingly
had
prepared
and
asked
the
court
to
distribute
to
the
justices
a
proper
reproduction
of
the
same
record
material
but
with
the
proper
pagination.
if
there
sets
forth
the
specific
matters
which
we
have
referred
to
and
these
are
the
specific
regulations
which
are
applicable
as
to
this
account
in
this
case
and
which
are
in
the
record
in
this
proceeding
and
are
now
before
you.
i
am
unable
to
find
a
definition
that
was
--
what
would
meant
at
any
time
by
the
use
of
the
term
"permanent
investment."
there
had
been
references
to
land
and
buildings,
there
had
been
references
to
shares
of
stock,
there
had
been
references
to
government
bonds
and
savings
accounts.
i
can
see
no
application
of
the
term
"permanent"
to
any
type
of
--
of
investment
such
as
they
referred
to
which
renders
one
distinguishable
from
the
other
in
that
event.
permanent
would
be
a
matter
of
intent.
you
will
find
in
throughout
the
federal
savings
and
loan
system
a
--
a
preference
for
long
term
deposits
and
they
refer
to
a
long
term
deposit
as
one
in
extending
beyond
two
years.
certainly,
a
--
an
--
an
investment
which
had
continued
for
that
period
of
time
is
just
as
much
as
a
perm
--
of
a
permanent
investment
as
is
a
purchase
of
a
government
bond
which
again
maybe
judicially
noticed
as
readily
cashable
providing
a
ready
source
of
funds
in
the
event
of
need.
we've
met
that
on
the
basis
of
this
record
which
is
not
that
of
a
savings
account
but
is
that
of
a
building
and
loan
account
that
there
was
no
exemption
but
the
only
thing
exempted
by
the
congress
and
the
congress
have
had
ample
opportunity
to
change
it
if
that
was
its
intent.
the
only
thing
exempted
was
a
payment
and
that
when
the
particular
property
attached
has
lost
the
characteristic
of
a
payment,
its
exemption
is
ceased.
