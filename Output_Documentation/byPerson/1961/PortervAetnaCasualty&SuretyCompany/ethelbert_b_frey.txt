mr.
ethelbert
b.
frey
if
the
court
please.
mr.
ethelbert
b.
frey
i
happen
to
be
the
committee
attorney
of
the
petitioner.
i've
been
a
member
of
the
district
bar
since
1912
and
this
bar
since
1933.
now,
the
question
before
this
court
is
not
on
about
a
building
and
a
loan
association
rules.
if
my
--
where
defendant
cited
this
bankers
case.
the
bankers
case
was
purely
simply
to
the
stop
the
building
association
from
taking
money
like
they've
been
taking
it.
now,
this
case
goes
right
to
the
point
whether
or
not
this
veteran
who
is
injured
in
korea
is
entitled
to
his
benefits,
his
disability
and
whether
or
not
article
38
of
the
united
states
code
which
absolutely
be
provides
that
no
attachment
of
judgement
either
before
or
afterwards
in
equity
otherwise
shall
file
a
lien
against
that
money.
now,
the
money
that
i
received
from
mr.
porter
as
his
committee
was
deposited
in
bank
and
when
my
report
went
to
the
order
to
the
court
below,
i
was
told
under
rules
to
put
it
in
a
saving
account
so
that
argument
itself
for
the
little
interest
to
that
idea.
that
idea,
the
only
expressed
understanding
with
the
columbia
federal
building
association,
if
you
look
at
my
brief
and
--
or
my
exhibits,
i
went
in
there
and
told
them
what
i
was
going
to
do
and
i
wouldn't
buy
in
any
shares.
they
said,
"you
don't
have
to
mr.
frey.
you'll
withdraw
that
money
out
tomorrow
if
you
put
it
in
today."
those
rules
--
those
rules
we
have
in
emergency
matters.
and
i'll
say
to
the
court
here
that
the
banks
in
maryland
and
at
once
--
that
have
failed
if
they
used
that
in
an
emergency
matter,
they
wouldn't
have
been
caught
swapping
accounts
or
--
or
transferring
money.
now,
this
money
that
i
put
in
bank
for
mr.
porter
was
for
his
necessities
and
for
his
keep
and
for
his
rehabilitation
purposes.
it
was
close
to
$6000.
from
time
to
time
it's
true
i
drew
on
that
account
or
one
occasion
rightfully,
i
drew
$2000
when
mr.
porter
was
going
to
be
tried,
they
said
he
was
forbad
ready
for
trial
on
that
graft.
i
drew
the
money
out
of
the
bank
with
any
hope
of
having
dr.
teplin,
united
states
psychiatrist.
mr.
freddie
and
dr.
gilbert,
who
is
now
dead,
testified
to
come
here
from
california
in
wisconsin.
and
then
when
i
made
an
agreement
with
the
district
attorney,
the
money
was
put
back.
now,
this
money
that
i
have
deposited
in
these
associations,
if
the
court
pleases,
has
never
lost
its
identity.
it
is
still
money,
they
had
not
even
purchased
of
it
--
with
it.
we
haven't
bought
stocks
or
bonds
and
if
your
honor
will
read
the
lawrence
case
thoroughly
and
the
trotter
case,
the
court
will
find
that
in
those
cases,
the
criterion
was
where
they
bought
real
estate
and
stocks
and
bond,
they're
examined
but
never
a
word
about
stock
or
shares
in
the
building
loan
association.
i
think
it's
common
knowledge
to
this
court
and
as
everybody
else
that
the
building
loan
association
today
is
the
same
as
the
bank.
you
don't
need
to
wait
any
time
to
get
your
money
out.
you
can
go
in
the
there
today
and
put
$1000
in
and
tomorrow
you'll
go
in
and
get
your
thousand
back.
not
the
same
thousand
but
of
the
same
kind.
now,
mr.
porter
received
this
money;
a
disability
fund
where
it
is
a
deposit
under
an
order
of
court
below.
and
then
when
he
had
accumulated
with
no
dependence,
assume
equal
to
$1500,
the
government
under
the
law
of
1958
or
1959
cut
his
disability
of
pension
off
completely.
now,
mr.
porter
hasn't
had
a
nickel
since
1959
and
that
money
was
attached.
that
money
was
attached
in
1961.
and
in
december
1959,
after
the
trial
of
mr.
porter
and
he
was
--
he
was
found
out
guilty,
the
hospital
over
there
started
to
run
a
bill
for
his
services
over
there
which
i
think
had
prior
or
they
already
jdugment
and
secured
after
that
against
his
estate.
it's
not
only
that,
there's
other
bills
that
are
due;
bills
for
bond
are
running
on
and
bills
for
different
things
that
he
requires
at
the
hospitals.
he
has
had
no
money
or
whatever
in
order
to
buy
the
actual
necessities
because
his
money
had
been
tied
up.
mr.
ethelbert
b.
frey
sir?
mr.
ethelbert
b.
frey
your
honor
that
--
mr.
ethelbert
b.
frey
well
if
the
court
pleases,
i'm
going
to
show
you
this
and
answer
that
question
and
had
i
put
that
money
in
the
safe
deposit
box
or
some
other
way
out
or
invested
in
something,
they
would
have
never
known
anything
about
it
but
under
the
court
rules
and
the
court
order,
i
had
to
comply
with
their
request
and
if
i
did
not
probably
been
disbond.
mr.
ethelbert
b.
frey
where
is
your
point
again
judge,
pardon
me
judge
harlan?
mr.
ethelbert
b.
frey
go
ahead
judge.
mr.
ethelbert
b.
frey
that's
right.
mr.
ethelbert
b.
frey
sir?
mr.
ethelbert
b.
frey
yes.
now,
i
say
this
if
the
court
pleases
that
--
that
in
my
--
in
my
brief,
if
you
will
read
it,
i
said
that
i
thought
that
it
wouldn't
be
long
before
mr.
porter
would
be
released
or
mr.
porter
was
released
being
homeless
on
the
6th
day
of
april
and
they
couldn't
turn
him
lose
because
he
hasn't
a
nickel
in
world
for
a
rehabilitation
purposes
or
go
to
school
or
do
anything.
and
he
only
has
rights
to
go
out
in
the
daytime
and
report
back
that
hospital
at
night.
and
i
respectfully
submit,
if
the
court
pleases,
that
that
article
38
of
the
united
states
code
certainly
protects
him
and
his
money.
i
claim
and
i'll
always
claim
that
the
money
that
i
received
is
still
moneys
whether
it
was
in
the
building
association,
it
is
moneys
and
it's
still
moneys.
and
as
such,
the
article
38
of
the
united
states
code
certainly
protects
him
in
that
respect.
and
i
ask
this
court
that
our
final
request
that
the
court
reverse
the
flagrant
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
in
this
manner
and
sustain
judge
youngdahl's
opinion
and
ruling
on
the
motion
to
quash.
if
the
court
pleases,
that
motion
was
filed
to
attachment
and
then
a
motion
was
filed
to
quash
the
memorandum
and
we
argued
that
case
in
court
and
the
court
had
it
under
opinion
for
a
long
time
before
it
decided
and
able.
now
here,
we
have
a
man
that
has
lost
his
constitutional
rights.
he
has
no
nickel
in
the
world,
he
can't
find
a
job
and
all
of
the
money
that
i
had
saved
for
him
under
an
order
of
court,
not
through
me.
the
court
ordered
me
to
do
that
is
being
attached
and
held
up
and
he
can't
use
it.
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
