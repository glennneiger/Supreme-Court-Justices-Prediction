mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
for
the
united
states
which
is
here
as
an
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
the
petition
and
the
petitioner
and
to
the
courtesy
of
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
he
has
allotted
me
25
minutes
of
his
time
and
has
agreed
that
i
might
open
the
case
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner.
the
case
brings
before
the
court
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
and
application
and
the
statute
itself
provides
an
exemption
from
taxation
and
suits
by
creditors
of
benefits
payable
and
administered
by
veterans'
administration
under
the
various
benefit
laws.
perhaps
that
the
outset
should
indicate
the
government's
interest
in
this
case.
the
statute
which
is
now
before
the
court
is
a
derivation
of
similar
statutes
that
have
been
on
the
books
for
the
better
part
of
the
year.
under
current
laws
administered
by
the
veterans'
administration
in
some
12
million
individuals
were
on
the
roles
as
recipients
of
various
veterans
--
or
various
benefits.
these
are
payable
not
only
to
the
veterans
but
in
giving
instances
to
the
widows,
parents
and
children
of
veterans.
a
very
substantial
sum
of
money
is
involved
running
into
billions
of
dollars
annually
and
the
government's
interest
as
we
come
here
today
is
to
what
we
hope
is
to
keep
faith
with
the
congressional
purpose
not
only
in
providing
for
these
benefits
but
in
providing
that
the
benefits
shall
be
immune
from
creditor
suits
as
well
as
from
taxation.
coming
to
the
facts
of
the
immediate
case,
they
date
to
1952
when
the
petitioner
was
indicted
for
murder
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
a
trial
on
that
indictment
resulted
in
his
acquittal
by
reason
of
insanity.
he
was
thereupon
committed
to
st.
elizabeth's
where
he
presently
resides.
the
murder
with
which
he
was
charged
took
place
while
he
was
an
employee
of
a
certain
realty
company
within
the
district
of
columbia
and
engaged
in
that
employment,
painting
certain
apartment
dwellings
within
the
district.
the
administratrix
of
the
decedent's
estate
brought
a
wrongful
debt
action
against
the
petitioner's
employer
and
another
party
not
relevant
here.
and
as
that
suit
ultimately
turned
out,
a
settlement
was
agreed
upon
and
some
$16,000
was
paid
over
to
the
estate
of
the
deceased.
the
suit
was
defended
and
the
settlement
was
arranged
by
the
respondent
here
who
then
under
a
subrogation
clause
of
its
policy;
liability
policy,
obtained
an
indem
--
indemnity
judgment
over
against
the
petitioner.
to
obtain
satisfaction
of
that
judgment,
writs
of
attachment
were
sued
out
against
two
savings
and
loan
accounts
within
the
district
and
a
checking
account
in
a
local
bank.
it
is
agreed
at
this
point
that
the
funds
on
deposit
in
both
the
savings
and
loan
association
and
the
bank
are
derived
solely
from
disability
compensation
benefits
paid
by
the
veterans'
administration
pursuant
to
veterans
benefit
legislation.
writs
--
motions
to
quash
the
several
writs
were
made
and
sustained
by
the
district
court.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
the
court
of
appeals;
the
only
issue
was
asked
to
the
immunity
of
the
savings
deposits
on
file
or
with
--
with
these
two
savings
and
loan
associations.
the
issue
as
to
the
immunity
of
the
bank
account
was
eliminated
from
the
case.
there
are
three
prior
decisions
of
this
court
under
previous
statutes
preceding
the
one
now
in
effect,
38
u.s.c.
3101
(a)
which
are
immediately
relevant
to
the
issue
now
before
the
court.
these
three
cases
were
decided
in
a
span
of
a
3-year
--
a
6-year
span
between
1933
and
1939
and
in
brief,
they
hold,
first
of
all
the
--
that
the
immunity
provided
by
the
statute
did
not
extend
to
permanent
investments
which
in
the
trotter
case
to
which
i
am
referring
consisted
of
real
estate
and
buildings
thereon.
the
second
case
to
which
i
--
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
decided
is
lawrence
v.
shaw,
where
the
court
held
that
bank
deposits
subject
to
the
draft
by
the
veterans'
guardian
were
not
subject
to
taxation.
in
other
words,
the
immunity
right
about
the
statute
from
taxation
carried
over
unto
--
until
so
long
as
these
banks
for
these
--
the
funds
were
on
deposit
with
the
bank.
the
third
and
final
case
to
which
i
refer
is
carrier
v.
bryant
where
government
bonds
and
negotiable
notes
purchased
with
benefit
moneys
were
held
not
to
be
immune
from
a
creditor's
suit.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
these
three
decisions
that
the
two
courts
below
reached
opposite
conclusions
and
that
there
was
a
division
within
the
--
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
the
government's
position
that
consistent
with
the
purpose
not
only
of
the
benefit
payments
themselves
but
of
the
immunity
which
attends
these
benefits
that
the
funds
here
in
issue,
savings
account
deposits
with
federal
savings
and
loan
association
should
be
held
immune
from
the
suit
by
aetna
casualty
company.
we
would
rely
primarily
upon
the
bank
account
decision
of
lawrence
v.
shaw
where
the
court
made
it
plain
that
the
congressional
purpose
could
not
have
been
to
require
that
the
recipients
of
these
benefits
carry
them
on
their
person
or
maintain
them
under
the
roof
in
order
to
prot
--
protect
and
continue
the
immunity
that
the
statute
otherwise
plainly
accorded.
rather,
the
court
made
it
plain
that
the
conventional
modes
of
receipt
and
retention
of
moneys
should
be
recognized
and
that
the
immunity
did
attach.
we
cannot,
of
course,
equate
a
savings
account
deposit
in
a
savings
and
loan
association
with
a
checking
account
in
a
commercial
bank.
nonetheless,
in
our
judgment,
the
similarities
between
the
two
are
such
that
the
same
result
should
obtain
in
this
case
as
obtained
in
the
bank
case.
there
are,
of
course,
legal
and
very
importantly
legal
distinction
between
an
ordinary
deposit
or
checking
account
deposit
in
a
commercial
bank
and
the
savings
deposits
that
are
here
involved.
there
is,
of
course,
a
debtor-creditor
relationship
in
a
commercial
checking
account
whereas
in
here,
the
depositor
acquires
a
share
and
interest
in
the
capital
of
the
savings
and
loan
association.
this,
as
i
say,
is
a
very
important
difference
but
it
is
in
the
difference
that
becomes
important
only
in
the
event
of
an
economic
emergency.
and,
over
recent
--
over
the
--
over
in
recent
years,
dating
back
since
the
financial
crisis
of
the
late
1920's
and
the
early
1930's
and
with
the
advent
of
federal
insurance
not
only
of
commercial
savings
accounts
but
federal
insurance
which
extends
to
the
very
accounts
that
are
here
involved,
the
public
has
become
more
and
more
to
regard
these
institutions
as,
if
i
may
so
--
say
so,
the
--
a
conventional
mode
of
retention
of
the
dollars
that
millions
of
americans
are
able
to
put
aside
for
some
emergent
use.
we
think
it
does
no
great
violence
to
either
the
principles
of
the
trotter
case
or
carrier
v.
bryant
if
the
character
of
these
deposits
are
recognized
even
though
they
may
technically
be
a
--
an
investment
in
the
technical
and
legal
sense.
unlike
a
bank
deposit,
these
accounts
--
through
dividends,
they're
compounded
usually
on
a
quarterly
basis
by
the
savings
and
loan
association.
a
bank
account
on
the
other
hand
since
1933
has
born
no
interest.
for
what
it
may
be
worth,
the
internal
revenue
service
regards
these
dividends
paid
by
savings
and
loan
associations
as
interest
and
requires
them
to
be
so
treated
on
the
internal
revenue
returns.
and
i
should
also
point
out
insofar
as
interest
itself
is
concerned,
that
in
the
lawrence
case,
well,
there
was
no
interest
accruing
on
the
bank
deposit
that
were
there
involved.
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
indicate
that
it
did
not
suggest
that
the
mere
allowance
of
interest
would
destroy
or
terminate
the
immunity
that
would
otherwise
attach
to
the
benefit
moneys.
there
are
of
course
other
differences
that
need
be
recognized
insofar
as
in
distinguishing
a
savings
account
from
a
checking
account,
that
is
of
course
that
since
the
accountable
requires
a
share
interest
in
the
capital,
he
has
at
least
a
technical
right
to
vote
for
the
management
of
the
association.
this
i
would
question
is
--
is
a
--
a
right
that
is
often
exercised
due
to
the
magnitude
of
the
--
and
prevalence
of
the
existing
associations
and
the
millions
and
millions
of
depositors
that
do
have
an
interest
in
these
accounts.
further
difference
between
the
checking
account
and
the
savings
account
is
that
the
checking
account
is
always
subject
to
the
depositor's
draft
whereas
under
the
governing
regulations
of
federal
savings
and
loan
associations,
the
depositor
may
be
required
to
wait
30
days
for
his
money
for
--
for
a
redemption
of
his
shares.
this,
we
submit,
is
like
the
interest
distinction
between
savings
accounts
and
bank
accounts
and
in
substantial
one
and
should
not
defeat
the
immunity
that
otherwise
would
attach
to
these
funds.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
in
the
share
--
in
a
share
of
--
of
ordinary
corporate
stock,
justice
harlan
i
think
it
will
be
controlled
probably
by
your
decision
in
carrier
v.
bryant
which
involved
a
government
bond
and
negotiable
securities
and
negotiable
notes
purchased
out
of
these
benefit
moneys.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
it
would
not
be
--
it
would
lose
--
the
exemption
would
terminate
with
the
purchase
of
the
bond.
this
to
our
mind
comports
more
consistently
with
the
investment
concept
as
it
was
first
announced
in
the
trotter
case
and
subsequently,
articulated
in
lawrence
v.
shaw
and
coming
to
this,
the
negotiable
securities
so
held
in
carrier
v.
bryant.
and
it
is
the
--
it
is
the
investment
aspect
that
we
do
not
deny
exist
in
this
case
but
we
suggest
that
a
rigid
or
mechanical
approach
to
the
solution
to
the
question
here
involved
by
a
determination
of
whether
this
is
a
dictionary,
or
in
a
legal
sense,
an
investment
that
we
would
have
to
concede
it
is
but
this
should
not
so
bind
the
court
that
it
would
defeat
the
otherwise
manifest
intent
of
--
of
congress.
this
was
the
approach
taken
by
the
district
court
and
i
suggest
the
approach
that
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
took.
at
the
same
time,
the
court
did
recognize
that
the
purpose
of
these
benefits
and
of
the
immunity
statute
was
to
assure
the
availability
of
these
funds
for
the
maintenance
and
support
of
the
--
of
veterans
on
the
case
of
a
deceased
veteran,
his
widow
or
his
children.
the
distinction
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
was
that
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
veterans
committee
here
first
deposited
these
funds
in
a
checking
account
which
was
of
course
immune
and
then
at
subsequent
periods
as
the
funds
accumulated,
he
transferred
them
into
the
two
savings
and
loan
association
substantial
amounts.
our
view
of
--
of
this
aspect
of
the
holding
below
is
that
it
is
an
--
an
unduly
narrow
and
restrictive
approach
to
the
concept
of
maintenance
and
support
as
it
presently
has
come
to
be
in
this
day.
to
be
sure
the
sums
paid
out
in
many
instances
are
very
modest
and
would
permit
of
no
substantial
setting
aside
of
amounts
in
either
a
bank
account
or
a
savings
account.
but
we
think
that
the
prudent
recipient
of
these
invest
--
or
these
benefits
should
not
be
required
to
keep
them
on
this
person
if
he's
able
to
set
aside
a
little
bit
every
month
or
under
his
roof
or
in
a
checking
account
that
should
be
entitled
or
should
have
available
to
him
the
modesty
income
that
these
savings
association
accounts
provide.
they
are
in
every
sense
as
--
as
liquid
and
asset
as
in
a
practical
sense
as
the
deposit
in
a
bank
because
of
the
record
here
and
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
--
shows
the
funds
while
subject
to
a
30-day
withdrawal
period
or
nonetheless,
in
a
practical
sense
available
on
demand
must
--
the
same
as
a
deposit
in
a
bank.
so
these
purposes
that
i
have
--
that
the
court
recognized
but
be
limited
because
it
felt
that
the
maintenance
of
a
checking
account
and
the
conversion
of
some
of
the
funds
into
the
savings
account,
indicated
that
these
were
surplus
funds
over
and
above
the
needs
and
necessities
of
the
petitioner
here.
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
this
is
an
unduly
narrow
and
restrictive
view
of
present
day
needs
and
point
out
that
school,
schooling
for
children,
taxes,
debt,
an
automobile
or
a
home
are
probably
--
properly
in
the
present
day
and
the
age
considered
as
a
maintenance
and
support
or
as
of
the
--
as
a
necessity
of
present
day
life
and
that
to
deprive
these
funds
once
they
are
deposited
in
the
savings
association
of
this
immunity
to
that
extent
tends
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
extending
the
immunity
to
these
provisions.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
of
the
deposits,
something
less
than
$9000.
there's
$5759
in
one
account
and
$3078
in
--
in
the
second
account.
but
that
mr.
justice
harlan
includes
two
dividends
to
the
to
the
time
of
judgment
and
of
course
as
the
district
court
held
and
that
no
one
questioned
the
dividends
as
the
crew
are
not
within
the
ambit
of
--
of
the
statutory
immunity.
i
think
one
brief
word
on
the
part
of
the
government
is
an
order
as
with
respect
to
the
wisconsin
bankers
case
since
respondent
suggest
that
the
position
that
the
government
take
here
and
that
it
took
in
that
case
is
someone
inconsistent.
the
wisconsin
bankers
case
was
an
attack
upon
the
home
loan
bank
board
and
the
charge
being
that
it
was
by
its
regulations
permitting
these
savings
accounts
and
savings
deposits.
well
as
authorizing
saving
and
loan
associations
to
engage
unlawfully
in
the
business
of
banking.
we
took
the
position
in
that
case
that
by
reason
of
the
technical
legal
distinction
between
a
--
a
savings
depositor
in
a
savings
and
loan
association
and
a
depositor
in
a
savings
account
in
the
bank
that
the
--
and
the
fact
that
the
depositors
and
the
associations
acquire
an
interest
in
the
capital
of
the
association,
took
it
beyond
the
proscription
in
the
statute
against
savings
and
loan
associations
accepting
demand
deposits.
and
we
do
not
say
that
the
deposits
here
are
demand
of
others
in
a
sense
that
they
are
in
a
commercial
bank
and
subject
to
draft
in
any
sense
but
that
the
--
even
though
they
are,
as
a
practical
matter,
subject
to
withdraw
on
demand,
they
are
nonetheless
subject
to
a
possible
waiting
period
and
as
i've
earlier
indicated
that
the
distinction
is
really
a
practical
significance
only
in
the
event
of
some
economic
emergency,
it
should
befall
the
savings
and
loan
association.
one
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
suggest
here,
and
that
is
that
these
savings
and
loan
associations
in
the
present
day
number
on
an
excess
of
6300;
they
have
6300
throughout
the
united
states.
they
have
deposits
that
run
an
excess
of
62
billion
dollars.
the
public,
i
suggest
distinguishes
between
these
and
a
commercial
bank
only
in
terms
of
the
rate
of
interest
they
are
able
to
receive
from
the
savings
and
loan
association
but
cannot
receive
through
a
bank
either
checking
account
or
a
savings
account
in
a
commercial
bank.
they
come
to
regard
them
as
a
convenient
and
a
secure
institution
whereby
they
can
take
dollars
saved
and
on
a
systematic
or
whatever
basis
they
can;
set
their
money
aside,
assured
in
the
belief
that
with
federal
insurance
up
to
$10,000
they
run
no
risk
and
that
as
a
practical
matter
in
the
present
day
and
as
it
has
been
for
years
and
years,
these
funds
are
immediately
available
for
whatever
emergency
or
whatever
need
may
arise.
we
think
that
consistent
with
the
public
understanding
of
these
institutions
and
the
insubstantiality
of
the
distinctions
between
these
accounts
and
those
that
the
court
or
the
account
that
the
court
was
concerned
with
in
lawrence
v.
shaw
that
the
ruling
of
shaw
case
should
carry
over
unto
this
area.
