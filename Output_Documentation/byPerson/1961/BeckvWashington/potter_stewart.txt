how
much,
if
any,
of
these
pretrial
publicity
related
to
the
offense
for
which
this
man
was
indicted
and
tried?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
the
mcclellan
committee
for
instance,
he
was
not
asked
about
this
particular
transaction?
justice
potter
stewart
about
the
sale
of
this
automobile?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it
is
the
very
last
line
on
page

or
--
begins
quoting
the
texas
statute,
when
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
or
state
of
mind
exist
in
the
juror
such
as
would
render
him
unable
to
act
impartially
and
without
prejudice.
is
that
what
you're
--
justice

stewart
and
that
was
in
section

--
28.030
of
the
revised

justice

stewart
mr.
kennedy,
before
you
sit
down,
i
have
one
question,
a
little
difference
on
it
if
i
may.
as
i
read
the
two
opinions
in
your
supreme
court,
either
one
grounds
it's
reasoning
in
any
way
on
the
unites
states
constitution
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
never
based
--
never
made
this
constitution
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
my
next
question
going
to
be,
you
do
concede
that
the
petitioner
has
raised
this
constitutional
question
at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
agree
with
me
that
it's
not
been
decided
by
the
state
court.
