justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
by
that,
the
actual
interrogation
before
the
committee
and
his
invoking
the
privilege?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
one
at
22?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
the
proceeding
--
the
motion
for
continuance
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
burdell
you're
not
making
a
point
though,
are
you,
of
the
change
in
law,
the
court
did
change?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
about
the
continuance
a
moment,
the
continuance
contemplated
what
if
it
had
been
granted?
a
trial
at
a
later
date
in
the
very
county
it
--
in
which
was
tried?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
in
that
very
county?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
probably
agree
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
are
these
the
proceedings
you're
talking
about
that
were
televised
mr.
burdell?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
(voice
overlap)
the
broadcast?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
rebroadcast?
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
these
interrogations
they're
doing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
the
(voice
overlap)
--
did
i
understand
that
ordinarily
an
offense
of
this
kind
in
your
state
prosecute
on
information
and
not
on
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
all
in
the
presence
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
kennedy,
the
motion,
at
least
a
motion
for
continuance
apparently
one
also
for
change
of
venue
was
filed
on
october
and
judge
douglas'
disposition
is
dated
october
the
11th
and
as
i
read
it,
he
doesn't
base
it
on
any
finding
that
--
and
atmosphere
of
prejudice
and
hostility
was
not
then
(voice
overlap)
but
rather
on
the
ground
that
the
attitude
towards
the
defendant
within
the
king
county
will
not
be
substantially
different
in
may
1958
than
it
is
at
the
present
time
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
will
only
be
slightly
different.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
that
--
this
is
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
set
for
trial.
this
is
the
order
which
set
it
for
trial
on
december
2nd,
195
--
it's
at
page
8
of
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
it
says
though,
defendant
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
suggest
this
is
more
than
semantics.
this
at
least
is
a
recital
that
the
courts
agree
that
there
was
prejudice
but
putting
the
trial
off
for
may
wasn't
going
to
change
that
anyway.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
that
--
i
am
jesting
that
is
not
what
he
--
what's
that
paragraph?
