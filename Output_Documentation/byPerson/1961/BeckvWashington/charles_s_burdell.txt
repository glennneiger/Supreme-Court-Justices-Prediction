mr.
charles
s.
burdell
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
--
mr.
justice.
the
questions
involved
in
this
case
set
forth
at
pages
6
and
7
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
the
first
question
is
this,
were
the
petitioner,
in
this
case,
a
prominent
labor
union
official,
has
been
subjected
to
continuous,
prolonged,
and
sustained,
extensive,
enhancive
and
adverse
publicity
in
all
media
of
communication
throughout
the
judicial
area
in
which
he
lives
and
is
tried,
must
the
state
provide
him
in
his
grand
jury
proceeding
where
the
grand
jury
which
is
a
fair
and
unbiased
and
impartial
grand
jury.
and
this
question
arises
in
the
state
of
washington
under
circumstances
under
which
accusation
may
be
made
by
information
as
well
as
by
indictment.
the
second
question
is,
does
the
petitioner
have
a
right
to
have
the
grand
jury
charged
in
a
fair
and
impartial
manner
and
in
a
manner
which
is
not
inflammatory
and
which
is
--
does
not
invite
the
jury's
attention,
the
grand
jury's
attention
to
adverse,
extremely
adverse
publicity
of
a
hostile
nature
which
has
been
circulated
about
this.
third
question
relates
to
the
conduct
of
prosecutors
in
the
grand
jury
room
with
respect
to
witnesses
who
are
testifying
and
have
testified
in
favor
of
or
in
a
manner
favorably
to
the
petitioner.
the
next
two
questions
relate
to
failure
of
the
state
and
the
courts
of
the
state
to
grant
a
motion
for
a
continuance,
the
motion
for
change
of
venue
under
these
circumstances
where
there
has
been
this
tremendous
campaign
of
vilification,
adverse
publicity
about
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
our
position
of
course
is
that
the
state
under
these
circumstances
must
provide
a
defendant
with
a
fair
grand
jury,
a
fair
method
of
accusation
and
that
the
state
must
do
so
both
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
well
as
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
we
make
no
contention
in
this
court
concerning
the
fairness
or
unfairness
of
the
trail
itself
except
that
we
believed
that
a
motion
for
continuance
should've
been
granted
and
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
should
have
been
granted.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes,
your
honor,
i
do
except
for
these
qualifications.
number
one,
a
change
of
venue
or
a
motion
for
continuance
should've
been
granted
to
--
so
that
we
could
have
tried
the
case
in
some
jurisdiction
where
jurors
would
not
have
been
subjected
to
the
adverse
publicity
which
they
were
subjected
to
in
seattle.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes
your
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
a
continuation
of
the
same
type
of
thing
during
the
period
between
the
indictment
and
the
trial
right
up
to
the
time
of
the
trial
your
honor.
then
returning
to
your
question
justice
harlan,
in
addition
to
the
question
of
motion
for
continuance
and
change
of
venue,
and
i
think
i
know
what
--
what's
the
point
you're
making.
the
unfair
grand
jury
proceedings
were
carried
over
into
the
trial
and
infected
the
trial,
infected
the
conduct
of
the
trial,
because
the
grand
jury
proceedings
were
used
to
impeach
witnesses.
the
grand
jury
proceedings
were
mentioned
in
the
course
of
the
closing
argument
by
the
prosecutor.
the
prosecutor,
for
example,
referring
to
the
grand
jury
proceedings
and
the
grand
jury
in
the
indictment
said
something
to
the
effect
that
these
grand
jurors
were
not
the
17
ogres.
they
were
just
ordinary
people
like
you
and
me.
the
grand
--
one
of
the
prosecutors
or
mayor
of
seattle
who
is
a
special
prosecutor
in
the
grand
jury
proceedings
testified
concerning
statements
made
by
the
petitioner
to
the
grand
jury
when
he
appeared
before
the
grand
jury.
and
although
he
testified
to
certain
admissions
or
statements
made
by
the
petitioner
in
the
grand
jury
when
we
attempted
to
obtain
the
entire
grand
jury
testimony
or
transcript
of
the
petitioner's
testimony
in
the
grand
jury,
he
denied
that
the
court
examine
the
transcript.
decided
that
while
only
this
portion
related
to
the
witnesses'
testimony
and
we
only
were
given
that
portion
which
the
trial
court
thought
related
to
the
witnesses'
testimony.
so,
in
those
ways
as
well
as
in
many
others,
in
those
way
as
well
as
others,
the
grand
jury
proceedings
were
carried
over
into
the
trial.
the
grand
jury
proceedings
were
used
at
the
trial
for
several
purposes
and
it's
our
position
infected
the
entire
trial
proceedings.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
that
is
a
fair
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
that
is
a
fair
statement
although
i
believe
that
--
i
do
not
believe
that
what
we
might
call
a
fair
trial
cures
erroneous
grand
jury
proceedings
which
have
taken
place.
if
that
were
true,
then
this
court
need
not
have
reversed
cassell
--
or
reversed
the
carter
case
or
any
of
the
cases
where
the
court
has
held
that
--
or
hoffman
or
any
of
the
cases
where
the
court
has
held
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes,
that
atmosphere
infected
the
trial
but
as
far
as
the
questions
before
this
court
are
concerned,
they
have
only
been
certified
to
the
point
of
--
should
the
court
have
granted
a
continuance
or
a
motion
for
change
of
venue.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
because
of
the
publicity
in
that
county
including
the
publicity
relating
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
now,
perhaps
a
few
statements
concerning
the
facts
would
be
of
assistance
and
incidentally
the
decision
of
the
washington
state
supreme
court
which
was
a
decision
of
four
judges
on
one
side
and
four
on
the
other
is
recorded
at
8
--
page
828
at
the
record.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
justice
frankfurter,
i
meant
that
the
facts
of
the
merit,
a
few
statements
about
the
substantive
facts
of
the
case.
i
think
the
procedural
facts
are
the
most
important
and
the
use
of
my
word
perhaps
was
of
course
poorly
chosen
because
if
it
weren't
really
important
i
wouldn't
even
be
saying
some
of
here
so
i
shouldn't
have
done
that.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
that's
what
i
should
--
that's
what
i
shall
do
your
honor.
the
conviction
was
for
embezzlement
of
the
sum
of
$1900
which
is
alleged
to
have
been
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
an
automobile
which
belonged
to
a
union
organization
of
which
the
petitioner
was
the
president
or
the
chairman
at
that
time.
this
automobile
was
sold
while
the
petitioner
was
outside
of
the
city
of
seattle.
in
some
manner,
the
testimony
was
that
the
purchaser
did
not
know
who
owned
the
car
so
he
made
--
he
had
seen
the
petitioner
driving
the
automobile
so
he
made
the
check
tables
of
the
petitioner.
and
because
of
this,
check
was
delivered
to
the
petitioner's
secretary
and
she
deposited
it
in
the
petitioner's
bank
account.
and
then
the
petitioner
testified
before
the
grand
jury
that
when
he
returned
from
seattle
--
or
to
seattle,
found
out
about
it,
he
returned
the
money
in
currency
to
a
bookkeeper
of
the
union.
the
bookkeeper
before
the
grand
jury
confirmed
this
and
said
that
he
had
received
this
amount
and
other
amounts
in
currency
from
the
petitioner
over
a
long
period
of
time.
now,
the
--
as
i
say,
these
events
took
place
at
the
–
in
1957
at
the
height
of
this
period
of
publicity
relating
to
the
petitioner
and
arising
out
of
the
senate
proceedings,
the
senate
investigating
proceedings.
the
proceedings
were
broadcast
on
television,
broadcast
on
radio,
they
were
disseminated
in
all
newspapers,
all
magazines
distributed
in
seattle.
they
were
displayed
on
kiosks
in
the
city
of
seattle
with
large
headlines.
they
were
subject
of
general
conversation
in
the
city
of
seattle
particularly
with
reference
to
the
subject
of
the
petitioner's
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
senate
committee
which
it
did
of
course
on
the
advice
of
his
counsel.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
the
indictment
now
was
returned
on
july
12.
the
grand
jury
pros
--
going
backwards,
backtracking,
the
indictment
was
returned
on
july
12.
the
grand
jury
was
impaneled,
i
believe,
some
time
in
may
and
the
senate
hearings
insofar
as
petitioner
was
concerned,
commenced
in
march.
the
petitioner
appeared,
i
believe,
on
march
26,
1957.
as
soon
petitioner
appeared
before
the
senate,
he
promptly
advised
the
senate
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
answer
any
questions
because
of
the
fact
that
an
investigation
concerning
his
income
tax
affairs
was
taking
place
in
seattle
and
that
upon
the
advice
of
counsel,
he
would
not
be
to
permit
--
he
would
not
be
able
to
answer
questions.
nevertheless,
he
was
interrogated
over
and
over
and
over
again
concerning
his
financial
matters
or
concerning
matters
relating
to
the
union
and
he
was
required
upon
the
advice
of
his
counsel
to
assert
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
over
and
over
and
over
again
in
response
to
each
of
these
questions.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
no,
i
didn't
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
justice
frankfurter,
i
didn't
represent
the
petitioner
at
that
time
and
i
didn't
count
the
number
of
times
that
he
asserted
the
fifth
amendment
but
the
newspapers
did
and
reported
the
number
of
times
prominently
and
i
do
not
recall
the
number
of
times
but
i
think
it
was
over
a
hundred.
the
questions
made
--
and
all
of
these
was
--
all
of
these
was
televised
--
over
the
radio
and
television.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
i
mean
that
your
honor
and
it
got
to
this
point.
it
was
--
it
made
such
an
impression
on
the
people
that
in
december
when
the
trial
took
place,
at
least
six
of
the
jurors
who
actually
served
on
the
panel
or
in
the
trial.
at
least
six
recalled
that
he
had
asserted
the
fifth
amendment
when
he
testified
before
the
senate
committee.
now,
these
jurors
said,
“well
they
could
decide
the
case
without
prejudice
against
to
the
petitioner
anyway.”
but
nevertheless,
they
remembered
it
and
of
course
this
court
as
(inaudible)
--
justice
jackson
in
krulewitch
and
justice
frankfurter
in
pennekamp,
and
justice
clark
in
irvin
versus
dowd
and
the
entire
court
in
the
marshall
case
certainly
now
recognizes
that
there
are
hidden
persuaders
which
people
do
not
even
recognize
and
that
the
person
who
has
been
subjected
to
the
common
conversations
about
the
effect
the
fifth
amendment
which
in
griswold
points
out,
everyone
thinks
that
anyone
who
asserts
the
fifth
amendment
is
guilty
of
something,
people
who
have
been
significant
to
this
type
of
thing
over
a
long
period
of
time
really
do
not
know
whether
they
are
prejudice,
whether
they
can
decide
something
fairly,
they
simply
are
not
qualified
to
say
whether
or
not
that
they
can
anymore
than
the
judges
can
at
times
as
justice
frankfurter
said
in
the
dissent
in
the
pennekamp
case.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes,
i
am
complaining
in
this
sense
justice
whittaker
that
i
believe
i
should
have
had
a
motion
for
a
continuance
or
that
my
motion
for
continuance
should
have
been
granted
or
my
motion
for
change
of
venue
should
have
been
granted
so
that
i
could
have
got
away
from
seattle
particularly
referring
to
change
of
venue
motion.
so
that
i
could
have
got
away
from
seattle
into
a
jurisdiction
where
there
was
less
radio
and
television
purposes.
now,
i
am
in
my
motion
for
a
change
of
venue.
i
recited
in
an
affidavit
that
the
county
of
--
i
believe
it
was
the
county
of
whatcom
which
is
north
of
seattle
was
a
county
where
there
was
not
as
much
radio
coverage,
not
as
much
television
coverage,
that
the
newspapers
which
were
carrying
these
articles
did
not
have
its
great
circulation
on
that
county,
things
of
that
sort.
i
wanted
to
be
in
that
--
in
those
counties,
in
one
of
those
counties
either
whatcom
or
snohomish
i
think
they
asked
for
so
that
there
would
be
less
of
this
sort
of
a
private
case
in
less
of
this
saturation
atmosphere.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
i
did
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
i
didn't
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes.
i
did
that
justice
frankfurter.
i
set
them
forth
and
i
want
to
say
that
until
that
time,
the
law
in
the
state
of
washington
was
that
if
the
--
if
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
asked
for
a
change
of
venue
upon
an
uncontradicted
affidavit,
he
got
it.
the
law
was
changed
in
my
case.
the
--
that
in
the
record
is
at
page
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
that's
probably
at
22,
about
22,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
no,
that's
the
motion
for
continuance
and
the
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
is
later
on
in
643.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
no,
i
think
on
--
i
think
it's
at
page
643.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
with
my
affidavit
right
after
it,
page
644,
in
the
affidavit.
in
the
affidavit
i
state
that
the
atmosphere
of
hostility
and
prejudice
towards
the
defendant
is
less
than
extreme
and
less
intense
in
the
counties
of
whatcom
and
snohomish
because
there
is
only
one
television
station
in
whatcom
county
and
none
in
snohomish
county.
i've
been
listening
to
the
last
case.
we
do
as
well
in
seattle
as
you
do
washington,
we
have
four
in
seattle
including
one
in
tacoma
which
is
in
competition
with
seattle
which
is
the
cbs
station
affiliate.
and
i'm
not
arguing
the
other
case
on
either
side
as
you
would
see.
i
see
in
this
affidavit
that
newspapers
published
in
king
county,
in
king
county
where
i've
read
have
emphasized
and
prominently
displayed
newspaper
reports
of
the
adverse
and
spurging
nature
to
a
greater
degree
than
the
newspapers
published
in
snohomish
and
whatcom
county.
of
course
the
newspapers
in
seattle
are
larger
and
have
a
greater
distribution
than
the
newspapers
in
the
other
county
since
seattle
is
--
seattle
times
i
believe
according
to
one
of
the
affidavits
has
the
distribution
of
about
a
180,000,
seattle
post-intelligencer
has
a
distribution
of
about
a
133,000.
that
is
not
true,
of
course,
of
the
smaller
newspapers
in
the
other
counties.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
no,
i
didn't
mention
that
because
everyone
goes
fishing
there
so
they
don't
have
to
watch
television
mr.
justice,
in
klickitat
county.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
there
is
some
--
oh,
yes
there
is
some
television
coverage.
now,
i'm
off
the
record
on
it
as
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
to
some
degree,
to
some
degree
but
of
course
these
are
the
--
these
are
--
to
some
degree,
rural
deliveries,
these
are
to
some
degree
people
who
will
buy
the
newspapers
at
the
corner
of
a
drugstore,
in
the
small
towns
if
they
go
down
there
to
some
degree,
these
are
people
who
buy
it
--
who
get
it
on
--
by
circulation
that
is
by
mail
and
get
an
edition
which
was
completely
different
than
the
edition
which
is
distributed
in
seattle
because
the
seattle
edition
of
course
would
have
the
very
latest
news
particularly
wouldn't
have
the
news
concerning
the
senate
proceedings
of
the
last
minute,
the
early
revision
which
would
have
to
go
in
the
mail
wouldn't
have
the
--
wouldn't
have
the
prominent
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
he
does
not
have
it
as
a
matter
of
right
justice
whittaker.
but
up
until
this
case,
the
law
was
that
a
criminal
defendant
upon
an
affidavit
which
was
uncontradicted
did
have
a
right
to
a
change
a
venue
as
matter
of
right
and
i
believe
the
decision
is
state
versus
hillman
which
i
think
is
in
our
reports
in
42
washington.
it's
--
the
cases
discussed
and
cited
in
our
petition
for
reargument
which
is
at
page
897
but
the
four
members
of
the
--
that
perhaps
should
take
me
back
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court.
that
is
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
when
we
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington,
we
argued
of
course
the
questions
that
we
are
arguing
here,
the
questions
about
the
right
to
a
fair
grand
jury,
the
right
to
equal
protection
before
the
grand
jury,
the
right
to
a
motion
for
continuance
and
change
of
venue.
now,
four
of
the
judges,
the
case
was
heard
before
eight
judges,
one
judge
disqualified
himself.
four
of
those
judges
thought
that
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed
on
every
point
and
one
of
the
judges
wrote
an
opinion
for
all
of
them
covering
every
point
saying
that
the
entire
thing
should
be
affirmed.
and
four
other
judges
said
that
it
should
not
be
affirmed
because
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
entitled
for
a
fair
grand
jury.
he
didn't
get
it,
period.
they
did
not
discuss
the
other
questions,
those
four
objected.
but
the
judges
rewrote
the
opinion
from
the
four
--
in
favor
of
affirmance
did
discuss
this
question
of
change
of
venue.
and
his
distinction
of
the
hillman
case
which
had
held
that
a
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
based
upon
an
uncontradicted
affidavit
gives
you
a
right
in
one.
his
distinction
in
that
case
was
that
--
well,
in
your
case
counsel,
meaning
this
case,
that
the
--
your
statements
in
this
affidavit
are
nothing
more
than
conclusions
and
the
hillman
case
doesn't
apply
if
the
--
if
the
statements
are
nothing
more
than
conclusions,
well,
it
doesn't
hid
--
it
of
course
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
they
are
conclusions
where
i
put
in
questions
about
the
number
of
television
stations
and
the
circulation
of
newspapers
and
things
of
that
sort.
in
addition,
i
have
included
in
this
affidavit
a
provision
which
says
that
jury
panels
in
king
county
where
we
tried
this
case
invariably
include
employees
of
the
boeing
airplane
company
and
that
a
few
years
previous
to
this,
there
was
a
most
bitter
jurisdictional
dispute
between
the
teamsters
of
which
the
petitioner
was
the
president
and
the
aeromechanics
union
concerning
the
right
of
representation
and
i
averted
here
that
that
dispute
resulted
in
an
attitude
of
hostility
and
bitterness
between
the
two
unions
and
the
officers
of
the
two
unions.
as
it
turned
out,
i
wound
up
with,
i
believe,
two
boeing
employee
jurors,
one
of
whom
was
the
foreman.
now,
i'm
saying
this
because
i
do
not
believe
that
affidavit
support
the
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
was
in
fact
a
merely
conclusions.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
no,
i'm
making
a
point
of
refusal
to
grant
me
a
change
of
venue
and
i'm
explaining
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
i
made
both,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
the
continuance,
i
made
several
motions
for
continuance.
i
recall
i
made
one
for
about
five
months.
i
believe
i
made
it
in
october
7th
when
i
think
i
asked
for
a
trial
in
may
of
the
next
year.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
in
that
very
county.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
and
the
answer
--
my
friend
mr.
kennedy
says
that
the
court
made
a
finding
that
i
was
not
entitled
to
it
for
some
reasons.
the
way
i
recall
that
finding
and
it's
in
the
record
here
and
i
properly
will
defer
to
it
in
a
moment.
the
way
i
recall
that
finding
is
that
the
judge
said,
“well,
i
think
you
can
this
fair
trial
now
as
you
can
next
may.”
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
probably
precise
to
what
he
said
and
he
didn't
know
he
said
that.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
well,
i
--
my
point
to
him
was,
at
least
give
me
a
chance
to
find
out.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
someone
has
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
i
could
get
a
fair
trial.
now,
i
suppose
you
can
say
this
is
his
determination
that
i
could
get
a
fair
trial.
if
we
interpret
it
as
being
that,
i
would
say
he
was
clearly
incorrect
in
support
of
those
motions
for
change
of
venue,
we
had
affidavits,
numerous
affidavits.
i
had
talked
to
lawyers
throughout
the
city
and
throughout
king
county.
i
think
in
one
affidavit,
i
indicated
or
in
one
statement
under
oath,
i
indicated
that
i
had
talked
to
50
lawyers
and
that
everyone
of
them
had
told
me
that
they
didn't
think
i
could
get
a
fair
trial.
and
i
told
the
court
about
this
by
affidavit
and
under
oath.
this
was
never
denied
by
any
and
i
do
not
believe
up
until
this
day,
so
far
as
i
know,
the
state
or
the
prosecutors
have
ever
said
that
they
in
good
faith
thought
i
could
get
a
fair
trial.
i
do
not
recall
there
having
said
so.
they
did
not
contravene
any
of
my
affidavits
concerning
these
subjects.
they
did
not
dispute
the
fact
that
the
publicity
was
rampant
that
the
public
clamor
was
widespread.
that
the
newspaper
coverage
was
the
saturation
type
coverage.
they
did
not
dispute
the
fact
that
these
attorneys
and
as
well
as
the
gen
--
many
people
who
we
had
talked
to
who
were
not
attorneys
had
said
that
we
could
not
get
a
fair
trial.
they
did
not
dispute
any
of
that.
the
only
thing
that
they
did
that
i
recall
at
one
point
where
i
was
stating
under
oath,
my
conversations
with
attorneys
and
things
of
that
sort.
one
of
the
prosecutors
who
was
there
at
that
time
said
that,
well,
he
would
always
take
my
word
out
of
court
but
in
this
case
i
had
said
so
many
things
that
he
didn't
want
to
go
unchallenged
so
that
he
just
--
they
denied
it
all.
they
didn't
specifically
deny
anything.
they
really
didn't
deny
anything.
now,
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
practically
none,
practically
none.
he
--
the
pretrial
publicity
in
effect
said
that
he
was
guilty
of
racketeering,
thievery
--
in
that
sense
it
did.
this
is
an
embezzlement
case.
he
was
charged
with
having
been
a
thief.
that
he
had
misappropriated
funds.
that
he
was
guilty
of,
i
think
in
one
case,
52
acts
of
misconduct
with
reference
to
the
union.
and
each
--
and
of
those
52
acts,
many
were
acts
of
misappropriation.
many
of
these
things
were
stated
in
a
general
way
but
you
couldn't
identify,
they
were
--
they
were
asserted
so
generally
that
you
couldn't
identify
this
particular
$1900.
the
petitioner
was
charged
with
having
misappropriated
some
$350,000
and
i
don't
believe
that
this
$1900
was
included
but
no
one
would
know
for
sure.
i
think
this
is
$1900
that
the
--
was
not
included.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
he
was
not
your
honor.
no,
he
was
not.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
in
the
mcclellan
committee
--
and
these
are
the
things
that
went
over
the
television,
the
type
of
christening
went
along
this
line.
mr.
kennedy,
the
attorney
general
would
say,
“mr.
chairman
we
have
information
indicating
that
from
the
year
1949
mr.
dave
beck
took
from
the
union
funds
some
$4812.39
and
deposited
it
in
his
own
bank
account.”
and
the
chairman
would
say,
“ask
the
witness
whether
he
did
it.”
and
mr.
beck
would
have
to
assert
the
fifth
amendment.
that
went
on
time
after
time.
and
then
in
one
case
which
seemed
quite
significant
to
me
while
--
after
mr.
beck
had
asserted
the
fifth
--
the
privilege
of
the
fifth
amendment
again
saying
that
he
did
so
from
the
advice
of
his
counsel.
senator
mccarthy
said,
“you
know
that
if
you
are
innocent
of
any
wrongdoing
then
you
could
answer
very
simply
yes
or
no.
it
is
only
if
you
were
guilty
of
wrongdoing
that
you
might
incriminate
yourself.
you
realize
that,
do
you
not?”
of
course
that
was
completely
incorrect
statement
which
went
out
over
television
to
millions
of
people
which
was
not
corrected
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee
or
any
of
the
lawyers
of
--
on
the
committee
or
anyone
else.
the
statement
was
made
just
a
few
months
or
rather,
the
grunewald
decision
in
this
court.
but
after
griswold
--
the
written
--
the
statement
about
how
people
generally
think
that
one
who
asserts
the
fifth
amendment
is
guilty
of
something
or
other.
then
i
have
a
two
or
three
other
notations
here
at
which
i
intended
to
read
but
won't
where
the
counsel
or
an
investigator
of
the
committee
says
that
we
have
information
indicating
so
and
so
and
the
chairman
then
said
--
asked
the
committee
if
he
did
it.
and
mr.
beck,
the
petitioner
has
to
assert
the
fifth
amendment,
i
gather.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
these
were
all
televised
and
the
proceedings
as
indicated
here
i
hope
i
have
time
to
reach
it,
these
particular
proceedings
were
televised
and
the
newspaper
of
the
next
day
indicates
that
the
radio
station,
one
principal
radio
station
in
seattle
was
jammed
with
telephone
calls
about
these
particular
proceedings.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
oh,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
oh,
oh
yes.
the
television
film
was
flown
to
seattle,
they're
flown
immediately
and
shown
in
the
evening.
the
radio
programs
of
course
were
concurrent
and
i
believe
that
during
a
portion
of
the
time
the
television
programs
in
some
way
were
rebroadcast
and
were
concurrent
too.
and
then
were
reshown
again
in
the
evening.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
oh,
the
last
time
he
was
a
witness
was
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
the
last
time
that
he
was
a
witness
before
the
mcclellan
committee
was
in
march,
justice
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
sure
that
you
were
here
when
i
answered
someone's
question
which
--
in
which
i
said
that
--
even
in
december
at
the
time
of
the
trial
the
jurors
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
right.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
it
was
the
last
time
that
he
appeared
before
the
mcclellan
committee
but
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
in
1957.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
he
returned
on
may
16,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
he
did
return
on
may
16.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
you're
--
it's
correct,
it
was
not
the
last
time.
the
things
that
i
have
been
reading
from
this
transcript
were
in
march
26
and
march
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
he
appeared
in
--
on
march
and
those
were
the
proceedings
that
i
have
just
read
and
then
he
appeared
--
he
was
represented
at
that
time
by
mr.
conroy
(ph).
he
then
appeared
again
in
may,
i
believe
may
16th,
that
time
represented
by
mr.
williams
who
also
advised
him
to
assert
the
fifth
amendment
which
he
did.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
just
one
day.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
mr.
justice,
it
may
have
gone
overnight
into
the
next
day
but
it
wasn't
a
prolonged
session.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
justice,
may
i
correct
that?
i
don't
believe
it
was
empanelled
but
notice
had
been
given
that
it
would
be
empanelled.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes
--
oh
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
well
not
exhibits
of
the
television
program
but
affidavits
indicating
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes,
newspapers
and
magazines
and
they
go
right
up
to
the
grand
jury
proceeding.
for
example,
here's
the
time
magazine
article
dated
april
8,
a
month
before
which
refers
extensively
to
these
proceedings
and
the
defendant
here
is
--
another
one,
that's
again
part
of
the
april
special
column
in
the
national
affairs
section
about
the
petitioner
in
the
--
his
--
in
the
senate
committee
here
in
the
same
article
there's
a
great
big
picture
of
his
so-called
lake-front
compound
if
one
looks
at
it
closely
enough,
one
can
see
it's
really
not
on
the
lake
and
there's
no
fence
around
it.
there's
not
really
a
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes,
and
they
--
yes
they
were,
names
that
were
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes,
right
from
the
beginning
everybody
knew
that
it
was
the
petitioner
who
was
being
investigated.
in
fact,
the
trial
court
--
the
judge
who
empanelled
the
grand
jury
said
--
told
the
grand
jury
that
they
were
going
to
(inaudible)
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
the
teamsters
union
and
officers
of
the
teamsters
union.
in
fact,
the
charge
of
the
grand
jury
went
something
like
this,
i
need
not
to
remind
you
that
the
--
of
disclosures
which
have
been
recently
made
before
some
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
that
is
in
the
record
and
in
our
briefs,
we
make
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
ordinarily
upon
information
justice
harlan.
and
that
is
--
so
may
i
take
a
moment
at
this
point
to
discuss
that
question
because
as
i
understand
it
it's
the
position
of
the
state
that
--
well,
the
erroneous
grand
jury
proceedings
don't
really
mean
anything
because
he
could
have
been
prosecuted
by
information
anyway.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
justice
harlan,
may
i
come
back
to
that
question
and
go
on
with
a
few
more
answers
to
the
question
i
was
discussing
with
justice
frankfurter
because
i
haven't
really
completed
it.
justice,
on
may
the
3rd,
(inaudible)
--
and
by
the
way
these
newspapers
clippings
are
smaller
than
they
really
are
and
the
way
they
sell
them
in
seattle
--
on
the
streets
is
that
they
display
them
on
what
i
call
a
kiosk,
i
don't
know
what
the
real
correct
name
is
and
they
--
so
you
--
anyone
who
passes
by
a
corner
can
see
it
and
of
course
they're
larger
than
this.
on
this
day
which
is
may
the
3rd,
you
will
notice
that
there
is
a
sub-headline,
this
is
the
seattle
post-intelligencer,
133,000
circulation
says,
“devin
to
be
special
jury
prosecutor.”
that
is
this
grand
jury.
devin
is
the
former
mayor
of
seattle
who
is
named
as
special
prosecutor.
the
big
headline
that
day
is,
“beck
indicted
on
taxes,
arrest
warrant
issued.”
that
was
the
income
tax
case.
these
two
things
happen
to
come
at
the
same
time.
here,
it's
the
same
different
issue
of
the
same
newspaper
the
same
day
that
has
a
heading
about
his
arrest
on
the
tax
evasion
case
but
they
haven't
heard
about
mr.
devin
being
appointed
prosecutor
yet.
here
is
a
clipping
relating
to
the
senate
proceedings
on
may
9th
by
this
time
as
you
could
see
mr.
--
mayor
devin
has
already
been
appointed
special
prosecutor.
here,
they
go
back
to
the
senate
committee
and
says
senate
probe
lifts
lid
on
beck
beer
business.
here
is
--
three
or
four
days
later
it
says,
“beck's
profit
from
trust
fund
of
widow
told.”
a
couple
of
days
later
on
may
the
18th,
i
think
it
is,
“trust
bill
may
connect
beck
to
u.s.
mail
fraud.”
on
may
the
15th,
it
says
beck
apparently
stole
$300,000
from
the
union.
here
is
chairman
mcclellan
saying
in
the
headline,
“beck
misused
union
position
in
52
instances.”
and
here
are
the
52
instances
written
by
dorothy
berger,
the
society
or
rather
the
seattle
times,
each
one
commences
misappropriation
of
so
and
so
and
so
and
so.
here,
the
point
again
that
listed,
this
is
may
14th.
now,
this
goes
right
up.
and
here's
u.s.
newsweek,
the
case
against
dave
beck
as
the
senators
see
it.
this
goes
right
up
to
may
21
and
i
believe
the
grand
jury
was
empanelled
on
may
20.
i'm
sure
it
was
empanelled
on
may
20.
and
the
grand
jurors
after
empanelment
of
course
they
were
not
kept
together
as
trial
jurors
are
but
they
were
permitted
to
go
home
and
continue
listening
to
their
radios
and
televisions
and
read
the
newspapers
and
so
on.
and
on
may
21
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes,
justice
harlan.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
of
course,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
that's
a
good
question.
i'll
answer
that
in
just
a
moment.
on
the
day
after
the
grand
jury
proceedings
commenced,
here
is
the
article
which
says
mcclellan
lays
many,
--
“many
criminal”
acts
to
that
and
so
on.
this
went
right
along
during
the
proceeding
of
the
grand
jury
justice
frankfurter.
now,
justice
harlan,
in
resisting
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
state
as
i
recall
said
something
to
this
effect,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
can
decide
what
their
law
is
and
they
said
that
because
the
state
of
washington
can't
decide
what
its
law
was,
this
court
couldn't
take
certiorari
and
that
the
only
remedy
was
to
do
some
--
for
the
legislature
to
do
something.
you
see
our
--
so
i
guess
they
were
suggesting
that
the
petitioner
go
to
jail
while
the
legislature
makes
up
its
mind
what
is
the
law
on
the
state
of
washington
is
but
of
course
that
can't
be
the
answer.
i
think
this
court
--
certainly
that's
the
four-to-four
decision
didn't
change
in
the
law
any.
the
constitution
and
the
statute
and
the
court
rules
of
the
state
of
washington
provide
that
every
decision
of
the
state
of
washington
has
to
be
a
majority
of
the
court.
and
in
this
case
there
was
quite
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
their
failure
to
agree
by
the
majority
and
their
first
decision
--
this
is
on
page
3
and
so
i'm
not
sure
what
page
of
the
record
this
is
on
and
--
i
can
find
it.
in
their
first
decision,
they
had
a
per
curiam
besides
these
two
4-to-4
decisions,
they
had
a
per
curiam
decision
which
said
something
of
this
--
it
said
this.
one
of
the
judges
of
this
court
disqualified
himself
from
participating
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
the
eight
remaining
judges
after
numerous
conferences
are
equally
divided
in
their
decision
for
the
reasons
appearing
in
the
opinions
filed.
there
are
being
no
majority
for
affirmance
or
reversal,
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
stands
affirmed.
then
after
reargument,
they
struck
out
the
word
“affirmed”
so
that
the
last
sentence
read
there
being
no
majority
for
affirmance
or
reversal,
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
stands.
that's
the
way
it
is
right
now,
although
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
washington
of
course
provides
it
in
criminal
cases
we
have
a
right
to
an
appeal.
but
they
have
not
affirmed
or
reversed
it
just
as
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
stands.
and
there
i
am.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
oh
yes,
i
think,
i
would.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
well,
we
have
the
--
you
had
the
oliver
case,
i
couldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
oh,
the
grand
jury
part,
i
haven't
--
and
i
haven't
really
answered
justice
harlan's
question.
i
don't
know
how
to
get
to
it.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes.
i'd
like
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
that
is
in
--
that
is
the
fact.
that
is
not
the
basis
of
my
equal
protection
argument.
now,
i
hope
i
can
answer
justice
frankfurter's
question
at
the
same
time
that
i'm
answering
this
one.
up
until
--
there
is
a
statute
in
the
state
of
washington,
it
is
rcw
10.28.030
and
it's
in
our
brief
at
page
2
and
page
3
which
provides
that
any
defendant
or
any
person
has
a
right
to
challenge
a
grand
juror
for
bias
or
prejudice.
now
that
is
--
that
means
of
course
a
defendant
in
custody.
it
has
to
mean
a
defendant
in
custody
the
way
the
statute
is
drawn
and
perhaps
i'd
better
read
the
statute.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
it
has
to
mean
afterwards
to
--
otherwise
there
isn't
equal
protection
and
that
is
what
we
couldn't
get.
it
has
to
mean
afterwards
otherwise
the
defendant
in
custody
has
the
right
what
the
defendant
in
custody
does
not
have.
and
this
is
--
this
is
my
argument
on
equal
protection.
that
statute
that
reads
as
follows,
somewhat
out
of
order
and
i
apologize
for
it
because
the
--
at
the
least
of
my
complaints
against
the
state
of
washington
is
that
counsel
didn't
wake
me
up
this
morning
and
i
didn't
get
myself
organized
here.
we
had
an
arrangement.
the
--
that
statute
provides
that
--
i
don't
find
it
but
do
you
have
it
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
no.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
no,
that
isn't
the
one
justice
warren.
the
–-
it
is
not
on
my
--
it
is
sworn
out
of
my
brief
and
i
have
it
here
somewhere
in
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
let
me
just
find
it
then.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
i
think
it's
on
page
2
or
3
of
the
brief
where
we
have
all
of
the
statutes.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
that
sounds
like
from
--
that
sounds
like
a
quotation
from
one
of
our
decisions.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
now,
that's
it.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
that's
it.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
that's
right,
(inaudible).
the
grand
juror
may
be
challenged
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
in
other
words,
if
you
know
you're
going
to
be
indicted,
if
you're
in
custody,
you
can
have
counsel,
you
can
go
to
the
empanelment
of
the
grand
jury,
you
can
then
challenge
the
grand
juror
for
bias
or
prejudice
and
you
can
have
him
excused
if
he
is
bias
or
prejudice.
now,
in
our
case
of
course
we
were
not
at
the
empanelment
of
the
grand
jury
and
we're
not
there
to
challenge
for
bias
or
prejudice.
and
the
point
of
this
whole
thing
is
that
the
court
asked
no
one
--
the
court
asked
none
of
the
grand
jurors
if
they
were
biased
or
prejudiced.
the
court
--
i
think
he
asked
three
who
were
labor
men.
there
were
three
labor
men
on
--
who
were
empanelled
and
i
think
he
asked
them
if
they
were
biased
or
prejudiced.
he
asked
no
one
else.
he
did
ask
them
if
their
service
from
the
grand
jury
would
embarrass
them.
but
he
asked
--
did
not
ask
them
if
they
were
biased
or
prejudiced.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
i
was
counsel
then
justice
harlan
and
i
did
not
attend
because
it
did
not
seem
to
me
consistent
with
my
view
that
a
grand
jury
does
not
have
a
right
to
single
out
a
particular
defendant
before
arrest
or
before
a
charge
in
a
preliminary
hearing,
in
empanelling
a
grand
jury.
in
other
words,
i
do
not
believe
it
proper
and
part
of
our
argument
relates
to
this.
we
do
not
believe
it
proper
where
there
has
been
no
complaint,
no
arrest
for
a
court
to
single
out
any
citizen
and
say
we're
going
to
investigate
you,
you
better
be
here
and
look
out
for
yourself.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
i
don't
believe
so.
in
any
event,
in
any
event
there
was
no
attempt
to
do
this
and
i
think
that
i
feel
that
i
had
a
right
to
presume
that
the
court
would
interrogate
for
bias
and
prejudice.
and
everyone,
i
may
say,
was
surprised
when
we
found
out
–
well,
let's
say
i
was
surprised
when
i
found
out
that
the
court
did
not
do
so.
now,
after
not
having
interrogated
for
bias
or
prejudice,
then
as
i
say
the
court
went
on
and
instructed
the
jury
something
like
this,
said
that
the
seattle
is
the
only
place
where
you
can
charge
this
man
with
some
of
these
things,
statute
of
limitations
that
run
on
some
of
these
things.
you
have
to
make
your
charge
here.
and
then
he
said,
“i
need
not
to
remind
you,
i
need
not
disclose
--
need
not
remind
you
of
these
recent
disclosures
of
the
senate
committee
which
indicate
that
the
--
that
officers
of
the
teamsters
union
included
the
--
and
including
the
defendant
have
misappropriated
or
stolen
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars,
money
which
came
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
members
of
the
union,
from
the
members
of
the
union
and
it
is
this
--
the
truth
or”
--
oh,
and
then
he
went
on
to
say,
“the
defendant,
meaning
mr.
beck
or
officers
of
the
union,
has
publicly
asserted
that
these
things
are
a
loan
and
it
is
this
truth
or
accuracy
of
this
if
you
are
to
determine.”
now,
that
wasn't
the
question
at
all
because
as
justice
stewart
said
this
$1900
really
didn't
have
very
much
to
do
with
it
or
wasn't
included.
and
the
question
of
what
the
petitioner
might
have
said
concerning
this,
being
the
$350,000
being
a
loan
or
not
a
loan
was
not
the
thing
that
the
grand
jury
had
to
determine.
now,
may
i
then
--
with
respect
to
the
grand
jury
proceedings,
may
i
just
refer
to
one
or
two
other
items
which
i
think
are
tremendously
important.
and
they
relate
to
this
question
about
the
right
in
the
state
of
washington
to
accuse
by
information
as
well
as
by
indictment.
the
interrogation
of
the
witness
who
testified
that
the
petitioner
had
given
him
this
money
was
quite
shocking
and
i
use
that
word
deliberately.
my
friend,
mr.
kennedy
was
not
one
of
the
four
prosecutors
who
was
present
at
the
time.
but
this
man
was
threatened.
he
was
harassed.
he
was
told
that
he
was
committing
perjury.
he
was
asked
if
he
would
take
a
lie
detector
test.
and
when
he
said
he
wanted
to
consult
his
attorney
about
it,
he
was
told
that
he
must
be
lying
or
else
he
would
immediately
agree
to
take
a
lie
detector
test.
the
prosecutor
said,
“we
don't
think
you're
telling
--
one
of
the
prosecutors
said,
“we
don't
think
you're
telling
the
truth
and
we're
going
to
keep
you
here
and
after
i
get
through
with
you,
mr.
so
and
so
is
going
to
take
over
and
i'm
going
to
keep
you
here
until
we
see
what
happens
here.”
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
oh,
yes
justice.
right
in
the
very
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
he
offered
himself
voluntarily
as
a
witness
but
not
--
and
he'd
--
i'm
sure
he
didn't
offer
himself
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
--
to
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
no.
that
is
just
the
point,
justice.
that
is
just
the
point.
and
by
the
way
may
i
say
one
other
--
i
think
i
have
time
before
i
get
to
that
just
to
refer
to
one
other
remark
that
was
made
in
this
grand
jury
room.
one
of
the
other
remarks
that
was
made
was,
“don't
you
realize
that
no
one
in
this
grand
jury
room,
no
one
in
this
room
believes
you're
telling
the
truth?
everyone
believes
you're
lying.”
now,
i
noticed
in
the
counsel's
brief,
he
has
a
long
summarization
of
the
testimony
of
this
witness
which
he
says
demonstrates
inconsistencies.
now,
the
trial
court
when
we
asked
for
the
--
if
we
can
see
that
grand
jury
testimony
so
there
were
no
inconsistencies
in
it
and
that's
one
reason
we
couldn't
see
it
but
the
counsel
says
it
was
inconsistent.
but
the
point
is
it's
not
for
counsel
now
or
nor
was
it
for
the
prosecutor
at
that
time
in
front
of
the
grand
jury
to
say
that
or
to
influence
the
grand
jury
by
saying
we
don't
believe
you
therefore
nobody
should
believe
you
it
was
for
the
grand
jury.
well,
that
type
of
statement
for
the
prosecutor
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
man
was
telling
the
truth
and
if
he
were
telling
the
truth
then
the
defendant
would
not
have
been
indicted.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes,
that
is
in
the
--
that's
in
the
brief.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
you
mean
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
oh,
is
that
portion
of
the
testimony
quoted
in
the
brief?
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
the
witness.
it
is
not
in
the
brief
because
the
testimony
is
so
long
and
there
is
so
many
of
those
things
but
it
is
--
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes,
it
is
in
the
record
at
page
--
that
interrogation
commences
at
about
page
388.
and
the
entire
interrogation
goes
over
to
about
page
3
--
to
about
page
476
and
the
entire
interrogation
is
full
of
that
type
of
thing
justice
black
and
the
portion
that
i
just
referred
to
is
included
in
that.
mr.
charles
s.
burdell
yes
he
could
and
the
important
point
in
that
connection
is
this,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
first
place
the
mere
--
of
course
generally
speaking,
the
mere
fact
that
one
can
return
an
information
is
not
any
reason
for
granting
or
for
refusing
to
dismiss
again
for
an
indictment
where
there
have
been
improper
grand
jury
proceedings.
we
have
never
--
let's
say
the
antitrust
laws
which
can
be
--
if
you
were
--
accusation
will
be
made
for
client
information
where
a
--
there
has
been
an
unauthorized
person
in
the
grand
jury
room
or
the
wrong
grand
jury
considers
the
matter
of
something
of
that
sort.
it
never
occurred
to
anyone
to
say
that
--
well,
they
could
proceed
by
information
anyway
so
we
will
not
pay
any
attention
to
this
error
in
connection
with
the
indictment.
but
here
where
a
witness
has
been
treated
in
this
manner
i
believe
this
indicates
that
there
is
all
the
more
reason
for
seeing
to
it
that
the
grand
jury
proceedings
must
be
handled
correctly
because
here
is
what
the
prosecutor
could
--
can
do.
he
can
call
a
grand
jury
proceeding
and
he
can
get
this
wit
--
the
possible
defense
witnesses
in
there.
he
can
treat
them
in
this
manner.
he
can
create
a
free
trial
impeachment
program
for
himself
then
dismiss
the
whole
thing
and
then
turn
around
and
file
information
which
i
think
is
quite
improper
and
not
the
function
of
the
grand
jury
at
all.

yes,
they
can

not
the

but
where
there
is
no
procedure
in
the
statutes
which
permits
a
pretrial
discovery
and
the
setting
up
over
an
impeachment
thing
like
this
was
and
then
in
information
basis.

may
i
give
justice
black
the
page
number
that
he
asked
me
about,
the
quotation
about,
“we
know
exactly
what
you
were
trying
to
do
and
no
person
in
this
room
believes
you,”
that's
