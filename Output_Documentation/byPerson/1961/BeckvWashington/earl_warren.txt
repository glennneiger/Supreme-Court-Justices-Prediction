well
mr.

--
without

--
he

chief

earl
warren
mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
law
in
washington
concerning
the
fairness
of
grand
juries,
the
requirement
of
any
court
fairness
of
a
grand
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
there
been
any
decision
prior
to
this
time
that
has
enunciated
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
hear
that
last.
would
you
talk
a
little
louder
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
do
with
the
section
of
the
code
in
washington,
10.28.030
which
appears
as
i'm
reading
it
now
from
page
2
of
petitioner's
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
that
isn't
the
one
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
difference
would
it
make
whether
he
was
under
arrest
or
whether
he
was
out
of
jail?
why
is
it
--
why
is
it
you
have
one
rule
one
way
and
another
rule
the
other
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
a
man
who
is
in
jail
--
is
man
who
is
in
jail
under
arrest
entitled
to
a
fair
grand
jury,
an
impartial
grand
jury,
but
a
man
who
is
out
of
jail
is
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
this
say
anything
about
private
prosecutors?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
where
do
you
read
that
--
how
do
you
read
that
into
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
court
has
never
said
that
though,
has
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
speaking
of
the
grand
jury
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
the
trial
jury.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kennedy,
i
don't
quite
understand
what
you
said
about
their
being
not
in
between
the
time
of
indictment
and
the
time
of
the
trial.
i'm
looking
at
page
76
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
and
it
starts
out
this
way,
seattle
times,
july
12,
that
was
the
day
of
the
indictment,
jury
indicts
beck
and
son
on
the
ground
of
larceny
accounts.
the
same
day,
seattle
times
says
kennedy
hails
jury
for
indictment,
i
presume
that's
another
kennedy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
another
kennedy
that's
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
not
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
yes,
i'm
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
now,
to
go
down
the
line
here,
seattle
post-intelligencer,
august
20th,
probe
told
beck,
okayed
phony
units.
then
on
the
22nd
of
september,
seattle
post-intelligencer,
union
corruption
hit
by
senator.
on
the
25th
of
september,
the
seattle
times,
beck,
brewster
had
no
intent
to
repay
funds.
october
1,
beck
calls
symbol
of
corruption,
that's
seattle
times.
then
in
seattle
times
the
same
day,
hoffa-beck
deal
hindered
by
two
rivals.
on
the
10th
of
october,
hoffa
election
violated
union
rules
and
the
seattle
post-intelligencer,
october
23rd,
jury
told
beck
carried
money
bag.
on
the
25th,
two
days
later,
teamster
asked
one
year
to
clean
house.
then
a
couple
of
days
later
probe
told
sears,
paid
beck's
way
to(inaudible)
and
the
next
one,
november
1,
corruption
astonishing,
says
lenny
and
then
it
goes
into
the
beck
jr.
affair.
now,
how
can
you
say
that
those
are
--
amount
to
nothing
between
the
time
of
the
indictment
and
the
time
of
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it's
all
corruption,
corruption
and
misconduct
on
his
part,
isn't
it?
i
don't
say
they
seem
standing
alone,
but
i
understood
you
to
say
there
was
nothing
between
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
time
of
trial
--
between
the
time
of
the
indictment
and
the
time
of
trial,
and
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
running
fire
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
wasn't
the
case
you
were
talking
about.
you're
talking
about
his
conduct
generally
and
i
understood
you
to
say
there
was
nothing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
car
sale?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
are
there
no
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
did
they
get
the
--
where
did
they
get
all
those
questions
and
the
answers
of
the
prosecutors
that
mr.
burdell
has
told
us
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
they
weren't
used
at
the
trial
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
the
--
at
the
trial
they
permitted
the
--
one
of
the
prosecutors
the
chief
prosecutor
to
come
in
and
testify
to
what
had
occurred
at
the
grand
jury
room?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
lieu
of
the
transcript
for
the
proceedings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
you
--
would
you
mr.
kennedy,
wouldn't
you
there
have
the
protection
of
the
court
rule?
wouldn't
you
have
an
unbiased
judge
receiving
the
testimony
and
appraising
it
to
see
whether
there
was
probable
cause
or
see
whether
it
was
caused
through
malice
or
bias
or
something
else?
it
--
that
doesn't
follow
what
you
said,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
he
does
have
the
right
to
dismiss
the
proceeding
if
there
is
a
probable
cause
shown.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
affects
the
ultimate
outcome
of
that
proceeding.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
the
invariable
--
that's
the
invariable
procedure
that
you
follow,
is
it
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
often
would
you
say
that
a
presiding
magistrate
dismisses
a
complaint
on
the
grounds
that
there's
no
probable
cause
shown
and
then
the
district
attorney
files
an
information
thereafter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
of
any
such
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
a
discovery
procedure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
if
you
don't
have
a
preliminary
hearing
and
the
district
attorney
just
files
an
information,
do
you
have
any
discovery?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
a
considerable
discovery?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
have
any
such
discovery
where
there's
an
indictment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
same
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
that?
i
wonder
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
wouldn't
have
to
start
all
over
again
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
re-arraign
him
and
do
all
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
all
the
things
leading
up
to
trial
if
he
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial
date
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
it
would
actually
be
a
dismissal
of
this
proceeding
and
the
institution
of
a
new
one
that
would
go
along
just
the
same
as
any
--
any
new
proceeding,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
