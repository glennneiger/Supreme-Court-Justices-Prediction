may
i
--
may
i
interrupt,
is
that
derived
from
the
same
poisoning
from
your
point
of
view,
poisoning
mass
media
which
affected
your
point
of
view
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
some
additional
one
at
the
time
of
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
say
mr.
burdell
that
perhaps
your
statement
of
the
facts
as
to
your
liking
or
importance,
whatever
you
said,
i
should
take
that
the
essence,
this
is
a
question
of
the
legal
conclusion
of
the
constitutional
significance
of
what
the
facts
are
on
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
--
have
done
what's
the
significance
--
what
the
facts
were,
the
value,
the
nature,
the
time
relation
of
what
concern
should
the
me
--
mass
media
infected
the
atmosphere
to
the
grand
jury
proceedings
and
the
subsequent
provision
of
(voice
overlap)
matters
at
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
time
span
of
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
this
appeal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
count
the
number
of
times
he
was
asked
questions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
he
withheld
answering
because
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
set
forth
the
matter
in
your
motion
for
a
change
of
venue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
must
--
those
must
be
a
set
(inaudible)
mr.
burdell.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
burdell,
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
heard
you
right,
you
said
that
the
grand
jury
which
brought
in
this
indictment,
the
indictment
that
brings
the
case
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
may,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is,
what
was
the
last
time
that
the
petitioner
was
a
witness
before
the
mcclellan
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
whole
sequence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
go
to
that.
i
want
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
march
the
only
time
that
he
was
summoned
before
the
mcclellan
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
1957?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
that
--
and
this
wasn't
the
last
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
the
--
his
appearance
before
the
mcclellan
committee
encloses
temporal
relation
to
the
sitting
of
the
grand
jury
which
brought
in
this
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
just
one
day,
just
one
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
one
day.
now,
the
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
those
of
--
and
the
grand
jury
was
already
empanelled?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
notoriously
so
meaning
by
notoriously
so,
that
was
known
to
public
prints?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
before
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
in
the
newspapers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
may
appearance
whether
it
was
one
day
or
over
the
next
day,
was
that
televised
and
broadcast
extensively
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
the
march
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
exhibits
of
that
are
in
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
photos
that
the
newspapers
got?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this,
were
the
--
while
the
proceedings
we're
going
on,
beginning
in
may,
commenting
in
the
indictment
in
july
--
on
july
12,
was
that
--
was
there
--
do
seattle
given
this
--
too
many
cities
are
given
to
somehow
rather
having
the
secret
proceeding
of
the
grand
jury
disclosing
that
case
in
paper?
in
short,
were
the
proceedings
of
the
grand
jury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
concurrently
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
publicized?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
relation
to
the
petitioner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
charged
with
investigating
his
affair.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
the
record,
the
grand
jury
charge
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
the
law
of
your
state,
suppose
the
law
of
washington
required
you,
intellectually
required
you
to
that
of
justice
harlan's
question
by
saying
that
the
law
of
washington
so
far
as
it
is
officially
declared
than
that
of
the
legislature
of
washington
which
said
the
grand
jury
need
not
be
a
fair-minded
disinterested
body
hearing,
would
you
be
–
would
your
case,
would
you
be
in
a
different
situation
if
you
had
to
make
that
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
you'd
be
bound
that
we
will
then
--
that
this
trial
would've
been
alright
from
your
point
of
view
with
reference
to
the
federal
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
grand
jury
part,
yes,
the
grand
jury
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
answer
it
for
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
must
be
--
might
be
substituted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
mean
after
he
was
--
after
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
didn't
he
offer
himself
voluntarily
as
a
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
that's
the
final
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
infer
from
that
that
you
think
because
the
petit
jury
was
fairly
selected
unassailable
in
its
competence
and
that
the
trial
was
not
subject
to
a
constitutional
attack.
that
is
of
the
final
answer
to
your
advice
in
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what
do
you
do
with
the
series
of
cases
going
back
75
to
80
years
beginning
with
neal
against
delaware,
103
u.s.
which
says
that
if
a
grand
jury
is
selected
in
disregard
of
a
fair
and
appropriate
selection
of
colored
members
of
the
community,
that
vitiates
the
grand
jury
indictment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
think
a
--
do
you
think
a
claim
under
due
process
that
a
grand
jury
must
be
a
fair-minded
body
and
not
be
hell-bent
on
indicting,
i'm
assuming
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that's
this
case.
there
is
–
does
this
raise
a
constitutional
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
that
a
grand
jury
must
be
disinterested
and
not
on
indictment
propelled
unfair
minded
body,
i'm
starting
with
that
as
the
starting
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
that
premise.
well,
that's
the
premise
of
--
after
all;
the
constitution
doesn't
say
a
grand
jury
must
have
a
fair
proportion
of
colored
citizens,
it
doesn't
say
that
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
also
says
that
states
can't
try
people
without
due
process
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
due
process
of
law
is
a
great
big
concept
filled
in
by
a
lot
of
notions
of
what
does
or
does
not
constitute
fundamental
unfairness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
you
mean
the
facts
don't
substantiate
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fact
that
it
does
go
to
your
complete
answer
because
as
i
understand
you
said
this
is
a
complete
answer
to
say
that
the
petty
jury
was
fairly
selected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
that's
no
more
of
a
complete
answer
in
one
case
than
in
the
other
so
far
as
i
can
see.
mr.
justice
jackson
would
--
i
must
--
i'm
bothered
to
say
with
a
great
deal
of
course
thought
that
all
--
all
those
cases
were
wrong.
i
don't
understand
that
argument
getting
with
me
or
not
in
the
brief.
but
if
you
start
with
those
cases,
i
do
not
see
the
answer
that
you've
just
made
in
a
situation
in
which
--
starting
with
an
assumption
that
the
grand
jury
was
biased
in
the
--
selected
so
that
there
couldn't
be
a
fair
judgment
by
it
which
to
me
may
well
be
fall
under
due
process.
how
is
that
any
different
from
a
biased
grand
jury
before
colored
citizens
on
it,
although
no
objection
is
taken
to
the
petit
jury
and
no
claim
is
made
that
the
petit
jury
trial
was
unfair?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
protection
in
the
federal
constitution
of
due
process
and
the
claim
that
you
must
support
is
that
it
is
--
that
a
biased
--
a
concededly
--
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
the
(inaudible)
that
a
concededly
biased
prejudiced
propelled
grand
jury
is
unrelated
to
the
requirement
of
due
process,
you
must
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
i
don't
think
you
can
sustain
that
proposition
you've
just
enunciated
in
your
recent
petitions
to
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
wasted
a
lot
of
time
in
discussing
whether
all
of
hearsay
evidence
is
sufficient
to
justify
an
indictment
if
what
you
say
is
so.
i
can't
imagine
a
clearer
case
of
--
if
bias
is
immaterial,
i
mean
if
--
what
i
call
an
indictment
for
a
fair
grand
jury.
that's
--
doesn't
depend
on
due
process,
then
what
difference
does
it
make.
why
should
we
inquire
to
what's
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
go
on
mcnabb?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
decision
go
on
mcnabb
that
under
mcnabb,
the
--
they
have
control
over
what's
decent
and
good
apart
from
what's
required?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
if
it
is
supervisory
jurisdiction
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
put
it
to
you
in
what
justice
jackson
out,
i
have
great
difficulty
in
seeing
the
difference
between
a
constitutionally
required
protection
such
as
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
generality
of
the
due
process
clause.
i
can
see
that
you
may
not
bring
yourself
within
it
and
that's
what
you're
going
to
show
us.
in
fact,
still
bring
even
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
relevant,
that
which
you're
going
to
deal
with,
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
this
particular
charge,
$1900?
is
that
what
you
mean?
you
just
said
there
was
no
hint
of
trying
the
case
in
print.
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
specific
embezzlement
charge
of
$1900?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
was
there
nothing
on
the
--
on
his
appearances
before
the
mcclellan
committee
in
relation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
trial
was
in
december.
justice
felix
frankfurter
refresh
my
recollection,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
this
is
the
delaney
case,
i'm
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
that
federal
case
is
sought,
but
what
was
the
time
relation
in
the
delaney
case
between
the
publicity
that
delaney
elicited
from
the
press
and
the
radio
and
the
trial
of
delaney.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
time
relation
of
the
investing
--
the
publicized
investigation
into
petitioner's
income
tax
problems?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
running
along
while
the
state
prosecution
was
going
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
publicity
did
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
publicity
was
after
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
two
months
before
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kennedy,
would
the
availability
of
starting
state
process
by
the
way
of
information
be
good
answer
to
the
racial
discrimination
found
grand
jury
indictment?
i
know
you
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
differentiate
that
from
other
regions
but
to
take
a
case,
suppose
some
of
the
cases
were
disclosed,
were
filed
at
state
law
that
there
was
available
indictment
by
information.
would
that
give
it
an
answer
to
this
--
to
the
application
of
new
doctrine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that
--
of
course
they
could
in
this
case
have
dismissed
the
indictment
and
filed
an
information
and
this
case
would
never
be
here
because
he
wouldn't
have
been
tried
under
an
indictment.
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
did
the
same
things,
suppose
the
same
questions
arose
under
the
racial
discrimination
found
indictment
in
a
state
in
which
the
prosecutor,
if
the
question
has
been
raised
or
if
he
thought
about
it
would
dismiss
the
indictment
bringing
information,
would
that
be
a
better
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
has
it
been
done?
this
is
all
speculated
whether
even
under
this
case,
even
this
case,
after
all
you
could've
dismissed
the
indictment
when
he
objected
in
october,
couldn't
you,
sua
sponte?
and
said,
“we'll
avoid
all
these
legal
controversies,
all
the
business
that
we
just
filed
an
information
that
cuts
the
ground
from
under.
you
could've
done
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
argument
is
--
because
you
could've
done
it,
and
didn't,
that
shows
that
on
the
starting
point
of
mr.
justice
harlan
made,
the
point
is
no
good.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kennedy,
i
--
as
my
concurring
opinion
in
that
case
showed,
i
had
sympathy
with
his
argument
as
a
matter
of
principle
as
we
say,
that
the
laws
in
dating
that
(inaudible)
had
--
the
decision
of
this
court
had
been
otherwise
and
no
use
of
--
dealing
with
this
problem
by
saying
that
justice
jackson's
dissent
is
persuasive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
in
those
cases,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
an
otherwise
invulnerable
to
trial
and
conviction
is
nullified
because
the
grand
jury
was
found
to
had
a
vice,
isn't
that
right?
that's
the
upshot.
