mr.
james
e.
kennedy
the
complete
answer
to
the
problems
involved
in
this
case
is
found
in
the
examination
of
the
voir
dire
examination,
the
empanelment
of
the
trial
jury.
that
jury
was
very
carefully
questioned
by
the
court
and
counsel
for
both
sides
and
each
of
the
jurors
that
finally
served
on
that
jury
had
no
continuance,
no
preconceived
disposition
for
the
defendant
in
this
case.
and
we're
able
to
act
impartially
and
all
parties
accepted
those
jurors.
none
of
those
were
challenged
for
cause.
now,
petitioner's
position
in
here
is
that
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
none.
with
the
exemption
that
prior
to
even
commencing
the
empanelment,
challenge
for
cause
interposed
towards
the
panel
in
general,
just
everybody
in
general,
but
then
the
jurors
were
called.
they
were
examined,
some
excused
for
various
reasons
and
the
12
that
finally
sat
and
heard
the
case,
none
of
those
were
challenged
for
cause.
they
were
all
accepted
by
the
court
and
both
parties.
now,
petitioner
had
claims
that
the
publicity
from
these
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes,
i
do.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
do
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes,
that's
my
proposition.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
think
the
answer
there
is
that
the
objection
to
exclusion
because
of
race
is
state
action
which
is
a
direct
violation
of
a
mandate
of
the
constitution.
any
state
action
taken
in
--
discrimination
based
on
race
is
just
void
from
the
start
as
to
it
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
you're
saying
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
starting
with
that
premise.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no,
but
it
says
that
states
cannot
discriminate
against
person
because
of
race.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes,
it
does.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
agree
with
that
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
--
proposition
of
law.
it
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no,
they
don't.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes,
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
well,
the
cases
in
which
a
--
state
courts
have
been
reversed
because
of
racial
discrimination
including
the
jury
panels,
the
grand
jury
panels,
but
that
is
state
action
which
is
void.
if
it
discriminates,
it's
based
on
irrelevant
invidious
criteria
in
selecting
jurors
on
which
you're
going
to
accuse.
now,
when
you
get
to
that
problem
of,
is
this
person
accused
by
a
biased
body
or
not,
there
is
no
such
protection
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
well
i'm
--
i
refer
the
court
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
held
that
illegal
action
of
state
officers
prior
to
trial
are
relevant
under
due
process
and
equal
protection
question
only
if
that
action
affects
the
trial
on
the
merits.
now,
the
only
exception
i'm
able
to
find
or
that
i
find
in
the
briefs
here
is
this
question
of
racial
discrimination.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
well,
then
i'll
proceed
and
try
to
sustain
the
proposition
that
this
trial
jury
was
fair
and
then
i
can
proceed
and
perhaps
answer
the
rest
of
the
questions.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i'm
not
aware
of
that.
i
don't
know
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
material
anyhow
because
i
think
that
particular
indictment
would
be
invalid.
now,
that
brings
up
mr.
justice
jackson's
dissent
in
i
think
it
was
the
cassell
against
texas
case.
now
in
that
case,
i
believe
that
was
the
only
case
where
the
grand
jury
was
selected
from
a
discriminated
body
but
the
petit
jury,
negroes
were
not
excluded
from
it
and
mr.
justice
jackson
dissented
quite
strongly
on
the
basis
that
it
could
have
made
no
difference
in
the
trial
itself
and
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i'm
unable
to
find
any.
i
find
the
one
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes.
the
district
courts
have
indicated
it
is
not
necessary.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
there
is
one
case
i
cited
in
my
brief
where
i
pointed
out
that
it's
not
clear
whether
federal
grand
juries
have
to
be
unbiased
and
there's
some
indication
by
one
fairly
recent
decision
of
this
court,
possibly
this
court
would
inquire
into
that
question
if
there
was
an
objection
made
that
the
federal
grand
jury
was
unbiased,
but
it's
never
been
decided
here
as
the
federal
grand
juries
that
district
courts
hold,
i'd
find
then
it
hold
to
the
contrary.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
think
this
court
inquires
into
that
as
an
exercise
of
its
supervisory
powers
over
the
federal
courts
and
it
does
not
reach
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
pardon?
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes,
i
think
that's
the
distinction
between
the
exercise
of
this
court's
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
then
it's
a
matter
for
the
appropriate
appellate
court
and
it's
not
a
federal
constitutional
question.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
that
is
in
the
state
of
doubt.
the
washington
court
is
unable
to
agree
as
to
what
the
law
is
in
washington.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no.
there
have
been
two,
i
believe,
cited
by
petitioner
where
there
has
some
dictum
that
indicates
it
is
the
policy
of
the
court
to
see
that
fair
and
impartial
jurors
are
selected.
and
that
was
--
the
one
of
those
as
in
both
of
them
involved
a
court
--
excused
in
the
jury
on
it's
on
motion
which
was
complained
about
and
it
was
held
that
in
it
--
within
the
power
of
the
court
its
inherent
in
its
power
and
it's
in
keeping
with
the
policy
of
the
state
to
see
that
fair
and
impartial
jurors
are
selected.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
said
it
is
based
or
in
keeping
with
the
policy
of
the
state
courts
to
see
that
fair
and
impartial
grand
jurors
are
selected.
it
was
dicta.
what
its
application
is
as
to
a
voir
dire
examination
is
not
clear,
what
is
required
in
the
way
of
voir
dire
grand
jurors
is
not
clear.
the
highest
court
of
washington
is
in
direct
disagreement
that
was
the
basis
for
the
disagreement
and
this
--
in
the
washington
state
court.
on
the
--
all
other
matters
raised
by
petitioner
here
as
to
the
change
of
venue,
continuance
and
the
fairness
of
the
trial
there
is
no
disagreement
indicated
by
that
court
at
all.
the
disagreement
solely
turned
upon
what
that
court
believed
should
be
their
policy
in
regard
to
--
grand
juries
are
selected.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
challenges
to
individual
grand
jurors
may
be
made
by
such
person
for
reason
of
want
of
qualification
to
sit
as
such
juror.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
and
when
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
a
state
of
mind
exists
in
the
juror
such
as
would
render
him
unable
to
act
impartially
and
without
prejudice.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
think
that
that
--
read
with
the
other
grand
jury
statutes
reveals
that
this
is
a
type
of
thing
--
a
basis
why
a
private
prosecutor
who
presents
the
bill
to
the
grand
jury
to
have
somebody
charged
cannot
deliberate.
that's
expressly
forbidden
by
our
statutes
also,
and
i
think
this
is
to
give
a
person
--
this
contemplates
a
person
who
is
held
--
who
has
a
charge
filed
before
a
magistrate
or
elsewhere
and
he's
held
to
answer
and
he
says
now,
“this
juror
dislikes
me
extremely.
he
will
bring
an
indictment
anyhow.
he
is
in
the
position
of
a
private
prosecutor
seeking
to
get
me
indicted.”
and
that
person
then
held
to
answer
to
interpose
a
challenge
individually
because
it's
based
on
the
proposition
that
there
might
be
some
person
on
that
body
that
--
is
the
attitude
that
stands
in
the
position
of
a
private
prosecutor
and
he
would
return
an
indictment
through
hatred,
envy
or
malice
which
is
the
jurors
have
to
be
sworn
not
to
do.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
this
is
a
protection
i
think
--
for
a
person
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
don't
think
that
that
reaches
what
this
statute
prohibits.
this
--
i
think
a
person
who
is
out
of
jail
also
is
protected
from
a
private
prosecutor
deliberating
on
his
indictment.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no,
it
doesn't
--
in
that
language,
no.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
read
that
by
reading
all
of
the
statutes
in
context,
the
grand
jury
statutes,
they're
the
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no,
that's
not
decided.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
it's
a
matter
yet
to
find
out
what
do
this
mean.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
now,
to
get
back
to
the
trial
jury,
petitioner's
position
is
that
these
--
the
publicity
from
these
mcclellan
hearings
so
infected
the
community
that
it
was
impossible
to
select
fair
jurors.
now,
to
support
that
contention,
petitioner
cites
the
--
there
was
several,
quite
a
few,
seven
or
eight
or
more
that
admitted
when
being
examined
on
voir
dire
that
they
had
prejudice
which
stemmed
from
the
publicity
arising
from
the
mcclellan
hearings.
but
in
contrast
to
that,
there
was
at
least
11
that
indicated
that
publicity
did
not
have
such
an
effect.
as
to
them,
you
have
examples
of
individual
people,
have
before
the
court,
the
juror
cox.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no,
i'm
speaking
of
the
trial
jury.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
it
was
a
juror
cox
at
record
page
70
who
stated
the
opinions
he
heard
in
discussions
about
the
mcclellan
hearings
where
jocular
toward
petitioner
rather
than
showing
any
animosity.
juror
dagrine
at
the
record
78,
had
heard
no
hostile
statements
arising
out
of
this.
juror
ryan
at
the
record
90
to
92,
he
had
not
read
about
this
case
and
he
had
no
prejudice
against
anyone
taking
the
fifth
amendment.
the
only
thing
he
remembered
about
the
mcclellan
hearings
is
that
mcclellan
was
mad
at
beck
for
taking
the
fifth
amendment.
there
was
juror
kraatz
at
the
record
102,
he
thought
that
beck
was
perfectly
right
in
taking
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
mcclellan
hearings.
juror
wallace
at
record
126
couldn't
recall
seeing
any
hostile
articles.
juror
eakin,
at
the
record
128
just
had
no
particular
interest
in
the
case.
juror
hookichan,
at
record
135
had
heard
both
hostile
and
favorable
opinions
and
thought
it
proper
that
he
--
that
the
petitioner
took
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
mcclellan
hearings.
there
was
juror
wood
at
the
record
145
to
146.
he
approved
that
some
things
that
beck
had
done
and
didn't
approve
of
other
things.
juror
arlington
at
the
record
149
was
just
never
much
interested
in
the
case.
juror
hickline
at
the
record
267
had
never
had
enough
interest
in
the
case
to
form
an
opinion.
and
juror
hill
at
the
record
290
had
just
never
paid
much
attention
to
the
case.
now,
these
statements
of
these
jurors
would
support
the
argument,
that
publicity
from
the
senate
hearings
just
did
not
have
such
an
inflammatory
effect
on
the
public.
and
further,
to
examine
the
jurors
who
were
excused
for
prejudice
would
indicate
that
also.
there
were
a
number
of
them
excused
from
prejudice
arising
out
of
the
senate
hearings,
but
there
were
four
who
were
excused
for
prejudice
--
from
other
things.
juror
loot
said
at
record
63
thought
he
should
be
excused
because
of
great
labor
relations
between
boeing
airplane
company
and
the
teamster
union.
juror
brown
at
record
168
to
169
stated
he
had
prejudice
towards
beck
which
arose
over
a
period
of
years,
but
it
was
not
from
anything
in
the
mcclellan
hearings,
and
he
didn't
think
he
could
be
impartial.
there
was
juror
myers
at
the
record
198
to
200.
he
said
he
was
biased
because
of
his
business.
he
employs
truck
drivers
who
were
teamster
union
members
and
there
was
juror
sanderson
at
record
207
who
said
he
was
biased
dating
back
to
1943.
now,
this
illustrates
of
course
all
the
more
reason
why
the
continuance
not
--
should
not
have
been
granted
in
this
case.
dave
beck
was
a
very
prominent
and
a
controversial
figure.
he
was
a
labor
leader.
he
admittedly
had
done
a
great
deal
toward
securing
many
concessions,
many
benefits
for
the
teamsters.
he
actually
stepped
on
a
lot
of
toes
particularly
in
the
area
of
businessmen.
almost
anything
he
did
at
anytime
was
news.
there
was
just
no
probability
or
likelihood
that
any
publicity
about
him
would
die
down
in
the
future.
the
proper
thing
to
do
in
such
a
case
is
not
to
postpone
this
indefinitely
or
change
the
venue
to
another
place
equally
exaggerated
as
it's
called,
but
the
thing
to
do
is
take
the
practical
approach,
find
out
if
in
fact
a
fair
jury
can
be
obtained
and
in
this
case,
this
record
pretty
conclusively
shows
that
it
was.
now,
the
petitioner
argues
that
when
there
is
too
much
publicity
or
a
great
deal
of
publicity,
the
jurors'
answers
cannot
be
relied
on
in
this
regard.
petitioner
argues
from
cases
containing
similar
language.
now,
i
think
petitioner's
argument
misses
the
whole
point
of
those
cases.
the
most
recent
i
believe
from
this
court
is
irvin
against
dowd
in
366
u.s.
reports
i
believe.
in
that
case,
i
think
it
was
over
90%
of
the
jurors
examined
had
a
preconceived
opinion
as
to
guilt
or
innocence,
but
said
they
felt
they
could
set
that
opinion
aside
and
decide
the
case
on
the
evidence
produced
in
court
and
it
was
held
that
in
the
set
of
circumstances
presented
there
that
the
jurors'
answers
that
they
could
set
aside
their
opinion
could
not
be
relied
upon
because
they
subconsciously
would
not
be
able
to
do
so.
that
is
entirely
different
from
jurors
who
do
not
have
an
opinion,
who
have
no
bias
and
say
they
can
act
fairly
and
impartially.
there
was
no
basis
whatsoever
for
saying
you
cannot
rely
on
those
jurors'
answers.
and
also
in
regard
to
the
voir
dire
examination,
in
the
irvin
against
dowd
case,
it
was
--
the
test
was
reiterated
that
just
because
the
juror
might
have
some
preconceived
opinion
does
not
necessarily
disqualify
him,
but
to
test
is
whether
he
can
set
that
aside
and
decide
the
case
on
the
merits.
now,
in
extreme
circumstances
when
almost
the
entire
panel
is
in
such
a
position
and
that
newspaper
coverage
is
so
inflammatory
and
so
widespread,
if
you
have
all
the
jurors
saying,
i
already
have
an
opinion
on
the
guilt,
but
i
can
set
it
aside
then
you
can't
rely
on
it.
in
this
case
though,
we
did
in
fact
select
12
jurors
who
had
no
opinion
and
in
effect
in
the
examination
here
petitioner
was
even
given
two
extra
peremptory
challenges.
juror
cox
at
record
71
to
73,
he
stated
in
answer
to
questions
by
counsel
that
he
had
a
general
prejudice
against
the
petitioner,
but
it
would
not
affect
his
fairness
in
deciding
this
case.
he
was
excused
for
cause.
now,
under
the
test
set
out
in
irvin
against
dowd,
he
was
an
acceptable
juror
and
one
which
counsel
should
perhaps
exercise
a
peremptory
challenge
against,
but
he's
not
subject
to
being
excused
for
cause.
there
was
at
--
juror
hubbell
at
the
record
195
to
196
stated
he
hadn't
formed
a
definite
opinion.
he
was
little
doubtful
about
whether
he
had
an
opinion.
he
stated
he
was
sure
he
could
be
fair
and
impartial
in
this
case,
but
he
could
understand
why
mr.
burdell
would
have
doubt
about
him
because
he
had
heard
a
lot
of
publicity
and
a
lot
of
things
and
a
lot
of
questions
asked
and
he
was
excused
for
cause
and
he
said
he
was
absolutely
certain
he
could
be
fair
and
impartial
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i'm
just
about
to
get
to
that.
i
have
one
more
point
to
make
here.
so
the
examination,
the
voir
dire
examination
pretty
conclusively
shows
that
the
trial
jurors
were
fair
and
impartial
and
had
no
preconceived
opinion.
also,
i
believe
it
was
the
handy
case
that
set
out
the
test
that
when
this
court
is
asked
to
reverse
a
state
court
because
of
a
prejudiced
jurors
that
that
must
be
shown
to
be
a
demonstrable
reality
and
not
a
mere
opportunity
for
prejudice.
now,
i
would
submit
that
this
record
is
scarcely
sufficient
to
even
show
the
opportunity
for
prejudice,
looking
at
the
newspaper
coverage
in
this
case.
the
indictment
returned
on
july
12,
in
this
case,
didn't
go
to
trial
until
december
2nd,
it
was
almost
five
months,
10
days
short
to
five
months.
now,
during
that
time,
it
was
after
indictment,
after
the
mcclellan
hearings
in
regard
the
petitioner
were
all
over
there
was
not
much
publicity
about
him.
the
newspapers
were
amazingly
objective
and
factual
in
reports.
there
was
no
editorializing.
there
was
no
attempt
to
try
this
case
in
the
public
prints,
and
almost
the
only
publicity
about
this
particular
case
was
generated
by
petitioner
himself
in
his
various
pretrial
maneuvers
which
he
necessarily
had
to
make
to
protect
his
record,
but
still
he
is
a
public
figure
and
anything
of
that
sort
he
does
is
news.
still
it
wasn't
particularly
played
up.
it
was
simple
report
of
matters
of
public
record
which
the
petitioner
himself
had
made
as
matters
of
public
record.
also,
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
publicity
about
the
petitioner's
activities
in
his
union
affairs,
his
membership
campaign
and
news
conferences
he
had
in
regard
to
these
things.
there
was
nothing
inflammatory
or
prejudicial
about
those,
but
still
again
he
is
a
prominent
public
figure
any
of
these
things
he
does
is
news,
and
they're
going
to
be
reported.
there
is
no
place
in
this
entire
record
from
the
date
of
the
indictment
to
the
date
of
the
trial
is
there
even
a
hint
of
any
attempt
by
the
newspapers
to
try
the
case
in
print.
there
are
no
press
releases
or
statements
by
the
prosecuting
officials.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes
and
i
even
mean
petitioner
in
general
though
specifically
the
$1900
charge,
but
there
is
a
--
several
places
where
rival
union
leaders
would
be
denouncing
back
and
that
would
be
reported,
not
particularly
prominently.
there
were
hearings
in
regard
to
other
persons
connected
with
the
teamster
union
which
that
are
reported
pretty
prominently,
but
there
was
almost
nothing
on
this.
there
was
nothing
at
all.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
am
unable
to
recall
any
after
the
indictment.
the
indictment
was
returned
in
july
12.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes
and
the
last
appearance
as
mr.
burdell
had
told
the
court
was
on
may
16
which
was
a
couple
of
months
before
the
indictment
and
the
grand
jury
was
empanelled
on
may
20.
on
about
may
3rd,
it
was
announced
in
the
newspapers
that
at
the
request
of
the
washington
state
bar
association
that
judges
in
king
county
had
called
the
grand
jury
for
the
purpose
of
examining
into
these
matters
raised
by
the
mcclellan
hearing.
i
think
they
specifically
mentioned
to
investigate
brewster
and
beck
in
regard
to
their
activities
in
the
union.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
well,
delaney
had
been
indicted
and
thereafter
the
senate
commenced
those
--
the
hearings,
there
was
--
calling
delaney,
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
think
they
were
calling
delaney
as
a
witness
but
there
were
hearings
about
him.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
and
i
think
--
now
my
recollection
is
better
than
i
think
it
was
no
more
than
a
month
or
two,
my
recollection
is
a
month
but
i
could
be
wrong
on
that,
after
the
hearings
that
the
trial
came
up
and
as
i
recall,
the
justice
department
had
asked
the
senate
committee
to
avoid
this
subject
just
--
because
of
the
fact
that
the
trial
was
pending
on
the
indictment
and
then
he
was
very
severely
denounced
in
that
hearing,
the
senate
hearing
shortly
prior
to
trial.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
haven't
got
that
well
in
mind.
i
think
he
was
indicted.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
my
recollection,
he
was
already
indicted
on
the
income
tax
matter
when
the
grand
jury
was
meeting.
i
think
the
indictment
came
out
at
sometime
close
in
there.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
oh,
there
is
--
that
there
is
a
second
income
tax
indictment
which
came
i
think
about
halfway
in
between.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
think
it
initially
got
a
big
headline
on
the
front
page
and
that
was
on
the
articles
obtained
upon
that,
and
i
don't
think
there's
much
after
that
at
all
or
anything.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
well
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
some
local
practice
in
king
county.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no,
that's
going
to
answer
your
question,
i
believe,
if
you'll
permit
me.
there
was
a
motion
for
i
think
that
is
not
the
order
where
he
got
the
month's
continuance
for
the
time
to
prepare
his
defense,
i
believe
also
in
that
order.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes.
it's
set
at
--
it
granted
him
a
continuance
of
a
little
over
a
month
or
something
for
a
time
to
prepare
defense
and
denied
the
motions
for
continuance
on
grounds
of
prejudice.
that
order
was
entered
on
october
11
and
was
argued
prior
thereto.
the
local
practice
in
king
county
is
that
when
a
person
moves
for
a
permanent
relief
and
some
portion
of
it
is
granted
that
person
prepares
the
order
for
signature
in
the
light
of
language
the
court
indicated
by
its
oral
ruling.
now,
i
think
that
language
of
course,
i
believe
you'll
find
it
presented
by
petitioner's
counsel.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
and
it's
a
--
that
is
a
document
that
would've
been
prepared
by
them
and
i
simply
--
i
think
it's
rather
clear
that
the
court
simply
wasn't
going
to
quibble
over
the
semantics
in
the
order.
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
well,
the
specific
ground
for
the
motion
was
that
the
community
prejudice
would
prevent
the
selection
of
a
fair
jury
and
that
motion
was
heard
and
argued
and
denied.
i
think
implicit
in
the
denial
is
the
court's
finding
that
there
is
not
sufficient
community
prejudice.
i
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
he
clearly
does
not
say
that
there
was
any
prejudice
existing.
now,
petitioner
would
have
you
interpret
in
there
that
the
case
is
so
hopelessly
prejudiced
already
that
there's
no
sense
in
postponement,
they
might
as
well
deny
his
rights
now.
i
can't
find
words
to
answer
that.
i
can't
feature
any
court
even
in
the
race
cases
making
such
a
decision.
this
motion
was
raised
several
times.
there
were
three
different
judges
that
ruled
on
these
different
motions
and
each
denied
them.
it
was
thoroughly
argued
on
the
basis
of
community
prejudice
and
that
the
court
was
correct,
i
think
it's
fairly
clearly
shown
by
the
voir
dire
examination.
but
even
if
the
court
had
not
made
such
a
finding,
the
washington
rule
of
course
is
that
if
the
lower
court
is
correct
for
any
reason,
his
order
will
be
sustained
even
though
he
might
not
have
recited
the
correct
reasons.
he
might
be
wrong
in
the
reasons
he
recited,
but
if
his
order
is
correct,
that
will
still
be
sustained.
here,
we
have
demonstrable
proof
that
the
order
was
correct
because
12
jurors
were
accepted
by
both
sides.
they
also
said
that
they
could
be
fair
and
impartial.
nobody
challenged
them.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
they
are
--
on
the
same
date?
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes.
that's
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
we
--
the
only
common
ancestors
that
i'm
aware
of
are
in
that
of
neal.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
can
say
it
this
way.
few
of
these
are
large
headlines
as
would
be
inferred
by
the
way
they're
set
out
in
the
brief.
a
good
part
of
them
are
the
inside
pages,
they're
small
articles,
several
of
them
relate
to
the
inter-union
fights
between
the
afl-cio
and
the
teamsters,
the
little
inter-union
squabble
they're
having.
this
is
considerably
more
than
a
squabble,
i
guess.
none
of
it
relates
to
this
charge,
none
of
it
is
particularly
inflammatory
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
said,
nothing
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
there's
nothing
here
that
applies
to
this
case
or
any
attempt
to
try
it.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
well,
if
i
did
say
that
i
was
obviously
mistaken.
there
was
certainly,
maybe
still
is.
the
point
is
this
is
out
of
--
i'll
put
an
illustration
of
my
brief,
i've
assigned
35
pages
per
day
per
paper
as
a
nominal
average
that
gives
over
5000
pages
of
each
paper
much
to
glean
these
articles,
many
of
which
of
an
inside
pages
and
only
remotely
relate
to
the
matters
at
hand
and
some
of
them
only
remotely
relate
to
beck
himself.
now,
i
think
i
pointed
out
in
error
is
an
exemption,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
publicity
during
the
trial
of
his
son
which
occurred
in
november
a
couple
of
weeks
before
his
trial
commenced
and
it
was
a
companion
case
on
substantially
identical
charges
that
was
embezzling
money
from
car
sales
which
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
well,
it
was
different
car
sales
but
they're
substantially
identical
and
that
again
there
was
no
editorializing.
it
was
factual
reporting
and
the
petitioner's
trial
had
been
set
for
prior
to
his
son's
and
at
his
request
it
was
put
over
to
afterwards.
that
was
the
request
for
time
in
which
to
prepare
defense,
and
the
court
granted
that
because
the
court
thought
it
was
reasonable
and
granted
it
but
it
was
the
petitioner's
action
that
set
this
after
his
son's
trial
rather
than
before
it.
and
again,
that
was
factual
reporting
limited
to
that
particular
case
that
--
on
matters
of
public
record;
no
surmise,
no
conjecture,
no
attempt
to
convict
either
one
in
the
newspaper
coverage
locally
at
that
time.
i'd
like
to
also
point
out
to
this
court
that
there
is
no
sufficient
showing
in
this
record
that
the
grand
jurors
were
unbiased
--
were
biased.
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
derogatory
publicity
surrounding
these
mcclellan
hearings
and
they
were
called
as
a
direct
result
of
that,
i
don't
think
it's
disputed.
to
digress
on
that
point
for
a
moment
that
is
an
established
mode
of
procedure
in
washington.
it
is
in
fact
that
i'm
aware
of
the
only
time
the
grand
jury
ever
is
called
is
for
a
specific
purpose,
either
to
investigate
a
public
official
who
apparently
is
doing
something
wrong
or
to
investigate
a
case
of
this
sort
with
the
normal
procedures
are
not
sufficient.
the
access
to
these
books
and
things
cannot
be
obtained,
and
it
is
solely
used
as
a
tool
of
the
prosecution,
as
an
investigatory
aid
and
it's
an
accusatory
and
investigatory
body,
in
no
sense
a
trial
body.
and
the
specific
reason
it's
called
is
just
because
it
can
secure
these
records
and
can
get
the
evidence
and
they're
always
called
for
a
specific
purpose
such
as
this
one
as
this
case
was
called.
now,
the
petitioner
on
one
hand
claims
that
the
grand
jurors
should
have
been
examined
as
to
bias
toward
him
on
the
other
hand,
he
complains
that
there
was
a
reference
made
to
him
and
a
charge
to
the
grand
jury.
i
submit
that
those
positions
are
inconsistent.
also,
in
regard
to
this
empanelment
of
the
grand
jury,
petitioner
complains
about
the
charge
because
it
referred
to
the
senate
hearings
and
this
grand
jury
was
called
for
the
specific
purpose
of
investigating
officers
of
the
teamster's
union
in
regard
to
misappropriation
of
funds.
i
failed
to
see
how
that
can
be
prejudicial
when
a
standard
method
of
directing
grand
jury
investigations
in
any
situation
is
to
present
them
with
a
bill
charging
somebody
with
a
crime,
actually
claiming
they
did
commit
a
crime
and
asking
the
grand
jury
to
investigate
that.
it
certainly
is
far
more
prejudicial
than
the
method
utilized
here
where
the
jurors
were
told
at
least
twice,
they
are
to
inquire
into
these
things
and
determine
the
truth
or
falsity
of
them.
and
they
were
sworn
to
present
no
person
through
hatred,
envy
or
malice.
there
is
no
indication
here
that
bias
or
prejudice
took
any
part
in
bringing
these
indictments.
i
think
it
is
not
controlling
of
course
at
least
a
factor
to
be
considered
that
the
petitioner
was
convicted
before
the
jury
demonstrably
fair
on
the
evidence
adduced
by
the
grand
jury.
it
was
obtained
by
the
grand
jury.
that
was
the
basis
for
the
conviction.
it'd
be
hard
to
find
that
they
did
not
have
sufficient
cause
to
indict
when
that
very
evidence
is
the
evidence
which
convicted
petitioner
before
a
jury
who
was
acceptable
to
both
sides.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
well,
i
think
that
throughout
the
argument
the
briefs,
all
of
this,
it's
--
the
complaint
is
that
we
don't
have
a
record
of
whatever
is
before
the
grand
jury.
we
do
have
the
proposition
which
is
pointed
out
by
the
lower
court
and
i
think
both
sides
that
the
evidence
used
here
was
only
obtainable
through
grand
jury
proceedings.
the
petitioner
has
even
made
reference
to
the
exhibits
used
to
connect
petitioner
with
the
crime.
we
have
these
references
in
the
excerpts
from
closing
argument
where
he
points
out
that
mr.
beck
did
appear
before
the
grand
jury,
and
he
said
he
authorized
the
sale
of
the
car,
i
believe
that's
in
the
record
around
about
310,
but
there's
no
dispute
that
that
was
the
same
evidence
that
i'm
aware
of
in
this
entire
proceeding.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
no
claim
that
they
did
not
have
sufficient
evidence
to
bring
the
indictment.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
none,
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
that
--
there
was
a
reporter
there
who
took
down
all
that
transpired,
at
least
by
statute
are
supposed
to
be
kept
secret
at
--
on
motion
of
the
petitioner,
the
superior
court
judge
in
king
county
had
these
things
typed
up
because
they
were
the
basis
that
petitioner
claimed
he
needed
to
inspect
this
to
show
that
he
was
prejudiced
in
the
grand
jury
proceedings.
so
the
court
had
them
typed
up
and
said
they'll
be
available
for
appeal.
i
don't
feel
there's
any
justification
for
letting
them
have
it
now
just
so
you‘ll
have
every
opportunity
to
protect
yourself
that
the
law
can
allow,
he
typed
them
up
and
had
them
preserved
so
that
they'll
be
available
to
bring
up
on
appeal.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no.
the
only
extent
to
which
the
grand
jury
proceedings
we
used
in
the
trial
was,
i
believe,
now
i'm
taking
this
from
petitioner's
brief
and
that's
the
only
one
i'm
aware
of.
one
of
the
prosecutors
was
brought
in
to
testify
as
to
things
that
the
petitioner
had
set
in
the
grand
jury
proceedings
on
the
basis
of
their
admissions
of
him,
and
i
think
in
that
regard,
and
mr.
burdell
could
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
i
believe
that
the
court
following
i
think
the
federal
rule
in
these
matters
had
that
testimony
also
made
available
to
the
court
to
see
if
there
are
any
matters
where
there
are
inconsistencies,
so
it
would
be
available
for
cross-examination
if
the
discrepancies
indicated
would
be
necessarily.
i
don't
know
if
it
was
made
available
or
not,
part
of
it
was
made
available
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
he
testified
to
some
admissions
by
petitioner.
i
don't
think
anything
else
would
be
admissible
under
rules
of
evidence,
but
admissions
by
the
petitioner
in
regard
to
the
issues
would
be
admissible
of
course.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
well,
yes.
i'm
not
so
sure
the
transcript
itself
would
be
admissible
though
they
would
have
to
be
identified,
but
this
was
just
testifying
to
admissions
he
made,
testifying
from
memory
and
now
i'd
also--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
fair
statement
of
their
position.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
they
rested
it
on
that
ground
but
my
recollection
of
the
opinion
that
they
specifically
found
that
there
was
no
proof
or
no
showing
in
the
record
that
there
was
bias,
but
they
said
even
so,
it
would
not
be
a
ground
before
that
line
to
affirm.
but,
they
also
determined
that
there
was
not
showing
of
prejudice
in
the
record
but
that
even
if
there
were
such
a
showing,
it
would
not
be
sufficient
and
the
other
four
tells
that
the
publicity
attendant
upon
it
together
with
the
method
of
examination
of
one
particular
witness
compelled
the
conclusion
that
there
was
bias
and
prejudice
involved
in
a
grand
jury
proceeding
and
that
dissent
as
it's
confirmed
by
both
sides
is
solely
concerned
with
the
grand
jury
proceedings
and
the
question
of
whether
there
was
prejudice
around
him
and
there
was
no
disagreement
indicated
there
with
any
of
the
determinations
by
the
other
four
judges
that
the
trial
jury
was
there,
that
the
trial
was
conducted
properly
and
that
a
--
there
was
no
error
in
the
trial
on
the
merits.
and
i'd
also
like
to
refer
the
court
to
counsel
--
he
says
that
the
grand
jury
proceedings
infected
the
trial
for
the
reason
that
certain
evidence
adduced
there
was
available
in
various
ways.
of
course
that
is
to
start
with
the
purpose
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding
is
to
get
this
evidence,
but
also
this
evidence,
the
impeaching
of
the
witness
or
testifying
to
admissions
by
the
petitioner,
any
of
these
things
that
counsel
refers
to
are
equally
available
in
other
criminal
cases
by
either
the
testimony
of
investigating
police
or
testimony
of
persons
present
at
preliminary
hearing.
incidentally
in
king
county,
almost
95%
of
the
criminal
cases
are
--
have
a
preliminary
hearing.
it's
very,
very
few.
they
are
filed
directly
in
the
superior
court,
almost
invariably
in
king
county.
there
is
a
preliminary
hearing
on
a
criminal
case
in
which
case
you'd
have
the
identical
situation
at
the
trial
in
the
merits
in
regard
to
things
that
transpired
at
the
preliminary
hearing
as
far
as
matters
of
evidence.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
well,
yes
it
does
because
the
committee
magistrate
has
no
control
over
whether
we
file
the
information
or
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
except
in
an
extreme
case,
he
could
possibly
cause
us
to
be
compelled
to
file
an
information,
but
he
can
dismiss
it
and
determine
there's
not
probable
cause
and
we
can
go
right
ahead
and
file
directly
anyhow.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
but
he
can't
affect
the
ultimate
outcome
at
all.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes,
he
has
the
right
to
dismiss
the
--
his
proceeding
certainly.
it
can
affect
any
right
of
the
petitioners.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
almost
invariable.
some
cases
--
most
of
the
time,
all
--
i'd
say
95%
of
the
time
we
file
it
before
a
committee,
justice
of
the
peace
and
presiding
committee
magistrate
and
then
sometimes
the
case
is
disposed
off.
there
are
--
sometimes
it's
bound
over
but
we
almost
invariably
have
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
well
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
there
are
some,
yes
that
are
relatively
recently.
i
can't
name
any
off
hand.
it
does
happen.
normally,
there
isn't
disagreement.
there
just
normally
isn't
any
big
conflict
there.
the
main
reason
cases
get
filed
directly
instead
of
having
a
preliminary
hearing
is
when
we
don't
want
to
disclose
a
lot
of
evidence
to
the
defense.
actually,
it
works
as
a
discovery
procedure
on
behalf
of
the
defense
a
good
many
times.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no,
no,
only
insofar
as
the
preliminary
hearing
will
operate
that
statute.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
we
have
a
--
we
have
to
name
witnesses,
we
have
to
give
the
counsel
notice
of
all
the
witnesses
we're
going
to
call
and
in
--
i've
never
heard
of
a
court
denying
this
motion.
i
rather
think
that
under
our
law,
defendant
has
the
right
to
examine
any
confession
made
by
a
criminal
defendant
and
as
to
any
other
evidence
that
the
prosecution
have
is
discretionary
with
the
superior
court
as
to
whether
we
have
to
disclose
it
to
the
defendant
or
not
upon
proper
motion
made
and
they're
quite
liberal
on
that.
i
had
several
cases
where
i've
had
to
make
my
entire
file
available
to
the
defendant.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes,
it's
considered
but
it's
discretion,
there's
no
set
procedure
except
to
file
a
motion
and
the
judge
has
almost
complete
discretion
and
just
determines
whether
in
this
case
he
feels
in
fairness
to
the
defendant,
he
should
have
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
oh,
yes.
yes,
its
--
there's
no
difference
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
oh,
yes.
there's
no
difference.
i
also
like
to
refer
to
petitioner's
complaint
about
the
closing
argument.
he
said
that
shows
more
of
the
infection
of
the
grand
jury
injected
by
the
prosecution
into
the
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
now,
he
complains
about
certain
language
used
by
the
deputy
prosecutor
which
was
in
rebuttal
argument.
now,
i'd
like
to
just
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
bit
of
language
which
the
deputy
prosecutor
was
answering
there.
at
the
record,
page
308,
this
was
mr.
burdell's
closing
argument
to
the
jury.
one
of
the
things
you
told
me
was
that
you
could
consider
this
case
on
its
merits
and
that
you
would
not
be
influenced,
you
would
not
be
biased,
you
wouldn't
be
prejudiced
by
the
rumors
and
the
gossips
in
a
frenzied,
insane
propaganda
that
could've
been
created
only
by
somebody
with
the
insanity
of
(inaudible)
has
created
about
mr.
beck.
and
further
down
that
page,
no
matter
what
you
told
me,
your
minds
must
be
subconsciously
influenced
by
the
tremendous
amount
of
unfavorable
publicity
that
has
been
circulated
about
mr.
beck
almost
to
the
point
of
saturation
of
the
public
press
in
the
radio,
in
the
newspapers
repeated
and
repeated
and
repeated
the
nazi
system.
further
down
that
page,
he
tells
the
jury,
“he
should
not
be
convicted
because
some
group
of
united
states
senators
find
it
convenient
all
of
a
sudden
to
utilize
the
airwaves
in
the
radio
and
the
television
and
the
newspapers
to
somehow
make
some
political
capital
and
make
political
gain.”
now,
in
309
he
says,
“but
nevertheless,
mr.
beck
testified
as
he
did
before
the
grand
jury,
as
he
did
before
the
grand
jury
without
a
lawyer,
without
a
judge
in
the
presence
of
four
representatives
of
the
prosecuting
attorney”
and
further
on,
he
says,
“i
wonder
if
some
of
you
by
now
haven't
discovered
why
it
is
important
for
people
to
take
the
fifth
amendment.
i
used
to
won
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
wonder
if
some
of
you
by
now
haven't
discovered
why
it
is
important
for
people
to
take
the
fifth
amendment.
i
used
to
wonder
about
that
myself.
further
down
the
page,
but
when
you
go
before
a
grand
jury
or
a
court
and
all
you
can
do
is
answer
the
questions
put
to
you
by
the
prosecutors
and
you
don't
have
an
opportunity
to
say
what
you
mean,
you
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
explain,
at
that
point,
the
deputy
prosecutor
objected
on
bringing
in
all
of
these
things
outside
the
record
and
asked
the
counsel
be
admonished
to
confine
his
argument
to
the
evidence
before
the
jury.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
it
was
approximately
three
months
after
the
indictment.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes.
well,
the
prosecutor
could've
joined
in
the
motion,
had
it
set
aside.
on
the
other
hand,
he
filed
in
information
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no,
no.
three
months
after
the
indictment,
they've
heard
the
trial.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
it
was
timely
made
--
it's
just
not
quibbled
about
in
washington
about
--
did
they
have
to
do
it
in
three
days
after
indictment
or
a
week
or
something
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes,
it
was
made
before
trial
but
it
was
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
that
would
be
approximately
two
months
before
trial.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
the
only
effect
that
could've
had
to
dismiss
it
was
if
he
could
get
an
extra
date
for
arraignment,
there
possibly
be
more
motions,
some
reasons
for
getting
further
delay
in
the
trial
but
it
could
not
affect
the
status
of
the
state
to
go
ahead
and
try
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
he'd
have
to
be
re-arraigned
certainly.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
the
arraignment
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes.
i
think
the
trial
date
if
it
has
been
dismissed,
three
months
after
indictment
when
the
motion
was
first
interposed
which
would've
been,
i
don't
have
the
date
at
hand,
but
i
recall
it
was
three
months.
that
would
be
august
of
--
i
don't
know
if
it
would've
affected
the
trial
date
or
not.
the
cases
are
set
by
the
presiding
judge
and
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
given,
i
have
no
way
--
i
can
only
guess,
but
he
gave
it
the
same
date
it
had
anyhow
or
another
date.
and
defendant
is
entitled
to
one
day
after
arraignment
to
enter
a
plea
and
to
interpose
objections
toward
the
indictment
or
information.
invariably
they
are
granted
much
more
than
that
if
they
requested,
there
was
a
--
with
the
exception
that
the
court
will
not
allow
this
delay
to
challenge
the
information
on
indictment
to
affect
the
orderly
setting
of
the
case
for
trial,
but
they're
very
liberal
to
give
it
all
the
time
they
can
use
in
that
area.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
trying
--
i
mean
that
question,
i
can
perhaps
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
--
explain
my
answer,
i
think
it
--
the
state
could
make
an
answer
if
they
wanted
to
dismiss
their
indictment
and
proceed
by
information.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
at
least,
wouldn't
be
here
on
that
issue.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
don't
think
that
it
would.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes,
we
could've.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes,
it's
--
i
say
it's
no
good
for
this
reason,
the
complaint
here,
the
petitioner's
complaint
in
essence
that
he
did
not
have
an
impartial
accuser.
well,
i
filed
quite
a
few
cases,
i
don't
think
i've
ever
been
impartial.
i
don't
think
there's
a
constitutional
question
involved
of
the
fact
that
a
case
i
had
filed
and
biased
by
about
that.
i
have
--
i
prejudged
it,
i
think
the
man
is
guilty,
i
wouldn't
file
it
and
i
am
biased
and
i
don't
think
that
that
violates
anybody's
constitutional
right
and
that's
what
petitioner
in
essence
is
complaining
about
here.
he
did
not
have
an
impartial
accuser.
now,
in
the
race
cases
that
your
honor
refers
to,
the
--
that
i
think
it
--
those
are
best
analyzed
by
mr.
justice
jackson's
dissent
where
he
points
out
as
a
disciplinary
proceeding
and
it's
the
only
practicable
way
in
fact
of
enforcing
these
rights
that
these
certain
states
cannot
discriminate
against
these
people
or
they're
going
to
have
to
go
do
it
all
over
again
because
its
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
i
say
it
--
i
think
they
correctly
analyzed
the
basis
for
the
decision
and
why
it
is
--
i
believe
this
court
will
adhere
to
those
because
it
is
--
as
much
as
anything
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
think
that
my
--
i
see
my
time
is
up,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
holding
in
those
race
cases.
i
think
that
its
limited
to
state
action
which
constitutes
racial
discrimination
and
therefore
state
action
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no,
it
has
never
been
a
basis
for
any
decision
in
the
lower
courts
except
to
the
extent
that
it
was
raised
by
petitioner
of
course
at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
--
but
the
court
has
never
based
its
decision
on
that.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
yes.
it
never
even
saw
fit
to
comment
on
it
because
apparently
there
is
actually
in
fact
not
a
federal
question
here.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
oh,
yes,
i
concede
(inaudible)
particular
record
in
that
regard.
mr.
james
e.
kennedy
no,
it
hasn't.
