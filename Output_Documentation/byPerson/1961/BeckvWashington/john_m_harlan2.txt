justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
your
various
contentions
really
amount
to
two,
namely
that
he
got
a
--
he
did
not
have
an
impartial
grand
jury
which
stands
independently
as
your
ground
of
the
attack
apart
from
the
trial
itself?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
secondly
that
the
trial
itself
was
unfair,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
say
--
you
recognized
that
the
trial
itself
was
fair?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
this
a
fair
statement
of
your
position
that
because
of
this
publicity,
it
resulted
in
a
biased
grand
jury
which
deprived
you
of
a
constitutional
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
if
that
isn't
so,
then
the
grand
jury
--
is
that
independently
--
doesn't
entitle
you
a
relief
then
you
say
that
the
grand
jury
infected
the
trial,
that
atmosphere
infected
the
trial
and
then
on
that
score,
you
should
be
entitled
to
relief
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that's
only
because
the
--
if
the
motion
for
a
continuance
or
a
change
of
venue
should
have
been
granted
it
was
because
the
trial
could
not
have
been
fairly
held
because
of
this
publicity
in
that
county,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
law
in
your
state?
your
court,
supreme
court
split
four-to-four,
did
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
more
than
said
that
under
your
law,
there's
no
requirement
of
an
impartial
grand
jury.
this
is
a
prosecutory
body
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
by
these
are
prosecutors.
justice
john
m.
harlan
before
it
was
said
that
was
not
so.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
are
we
to
take
in
--
as
the
law
in
your
state
as
being?
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright.
i'd
like
to
put
to
you
what's
in
my
mind,
namely
this.
are
you
making
equal
protection
claim?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
that
up
to
beck's
time,
the
defendants
were
under
state
law
entitled
to
impartial
grand
juries
and
that
he
was
out
of
his
decision
and
that
must
be
the
difference.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
effort
by
your
predecessors
so
far
as
the
record
shows
to
ask
the
court
to
interrogate
the
grand
jury
(voice
overlap)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
maybe
i'm
talking
about
old
days
but
i
thought
that
we
don't
have
time?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
a
special
grand
jury
is
brought
in
for
a
particular
purpose
in
such
a
situation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
that
under
your
law,
the
prosecutor
had
met
on
the
opening
of
the
trial
with
clear
objections
that
this
grand
jury
for
the
turning
around
of
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
mr.
burdell,
if
the
grand
jury
declined
to
indict
here
despite
the
prosecutor's
efforts
could
the
prosecutor
then
file
it
on
information
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question,
(inaudible)
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
take
just
one
(inaudible).
do
you
know
what
the
issues
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
lower
courts
have
indicated
otherwise.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
the
--
that
there
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
an
impartial
state
grand
jury,
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
what
it
is
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
was
violated
in
this
instance?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
--
would
you
say
it
was
a
fair
reading
of
your
supreme
court
opinion,
the
four
who
voted
to
sustain
the
conviction
that
they
recognized
that
there
was
prejudice,
that
there
was
not
an
impartial
jury
but
the
rest
of
their
decision
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
such
a
crime
under
state
law.
justice
john

i'm

where
the

seems
to
say,
however,
the

the

court
says,
â€œhowever,
the
premise
is
not
correct
unless,
unless
as
the
appellants
argue
our
19
--
our
1954,
a
grand
jury
statute
requires
the
grand
jury
to
be
impartial
and
unfair.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
implicitly
recognizing
not
taking
issue
with
the
merits
of
the
claim
of
prejudice,
but
resting
the
decision
on
the
ground
that
it
made
no

under
state
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
kennedy,
at
what
point
in
the
trial
or
in
the
state
court
proceedings
was
the
attack
on
the
grand
jury,
constitution
of
the
grand
jury
or
the
impartiality
of
the
grand
jury
first
made?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
the
attack
that's
been
made
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
at
the
advent
of
the
trial,
under
your
law,
could
the
prosecutor
has
had
--
or
supersede
the
grand
jury
indictment
with
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
information?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
first
attack
was
not
made
until
after
the
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
after
the
indictment
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
was
made
before
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
at
what
time,
two
months
before
trial.
