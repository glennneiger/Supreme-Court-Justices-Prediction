justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
would
be
impossible
to
read
it
and
say
to
the
court
that
congress
has
the
power
to
carry
out
certain
powers
under
article
i
power,
and
the
mind
with
that,
the
kind
of
courts
that
article
iii
provides?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
that
in
the
article
iii
and
article
i
court
if
that's
the
way
you're
going
to
have
to
refer
to
it
as
articles?
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
of
us
are
very
lucky.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
i've
been
waiting
to
see
if
i
could
ask
you.
suppose
the
congress
would
declare
tomorrow
interstate
commerce
commission
is
a
court
in
article
iii
court
that
they
do
try
some
cases
that
are
essentially
legal,
reparations
cases,
could
those
judges
be
assigned
to
district
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
couldn't
they
be
if
congress
declared
it
such
as
they've
declared
it
with
reference
to
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this?
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
you
have
occasionally
sort
of
shied
away
from
putting
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
judges
are
appointed
for
life,
to
try
certain
kind
of
judicial
controversy.
but
you
have
duties
where
you
observe
the
rules
of
court
and
that
you
have
emphasized
more
in
article
iii
court
and
in
another
kind
of
court
which
confuses
me.
i
must
admit.
it
seems
to
me
that
maybe
your
argument
--
i'm
not
absolutely
sure.
these
judges
are
appointed
to
the
court
where
they
do
not
have
life
tenure,
where
they
try
a
lot
of
cases
that
are
not
triable
before
a
jury.
you
do
not
observe
due
process
of
law
including
these
safeguards
and
that
you
are
arguing
that
this
judge
is
for
different
kind
of
court
and
doesn't
have
life
tenure.
what
difference
would
it
make
if
they'd
given
him
a
life
tenure
before
he
was
appointed
or
afterwards,
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
understood
--
that's
what
i
understood
and
that's
why
i
want
to
know
what's
the
difference
between
allowing
this
man
to
move
from
that
court
into
a
district
court
and
try
cases
and
controversies
of
the
criminal
nature
and
other
natures
that
requires
certain
things
like
you,
what's
the
difference
in
letting
him
move
from
there,
having
the
congress
to
say
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
so
do
you
consider
the
court
and
assign
him
to
these
other
places?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
might
give
--
they
might
give
them
a
statutory
a
life
tenure
also.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
get
away
from
those
non-delegable
so
what
--
what
exactly
they
have
on
the
man
being
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
kind
of
court
does
he
get?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
are
the
functions
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
if
they
are
any
less
or
anymore
judicial
than
those
of
this
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
a
reparation
suit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
settle?
justice
hugo
l.
black
railroads.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
in
the
nature
of
judicial
controversy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
was
asking
that
because
i
was
wondering
why
that
wouldn't
justify
congress,
it
justified
in
this
case
and
declaring
that
it's
a
court
--
full-pledged
court
to
the
extent
that
they
can
be
assigned
to
district
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
seems
to
me
that
we
have
based,
i'm
not
sure,
on
the
idea
that
the
constitution
provides
certain
things
that
must
take
place
for
judge
acting
--
i
won't
say
an
article
iii
court,
but
in
a
court
that
tries
peoples'
crimes,
adjudicates
lawsuits
of
a
nature
that
require
safeguard
to
the
constitution.
if
they
must
be
appointed
and
hold
office
subject
to
life
tenure,
confirmation
and
so
forth
by
the
senate
or
these
required
to
be
confirmed
by
the
senate,
they
are,
are
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
else
is
left
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
pardon
me
for
adding
this
to
his
statement.
i
hope
you
will
not
assume
without
giving
your
reasons
later
that
that
can
be
done
in
the
district
of
columbia
without
it
spreading
to
the
rest
of
the
country
and
point
out
through
distinctions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
could
waive
trial
by
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
reference
to
the
first
part
of
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
drew
distinctions
along
the
line
of
difference
between
a
legislative
court
and
an
article
iii
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
i
find
it
difficult
to
decide,
difficult
to
follow
that
what
you
meant
by
that
in
this
respect
--
in
this
respect,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
district
of
columbia,
a
man
could
be
tried
for
what
you
call
a
legislative
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
one
wherein
could
be
tried
--
which
could
only
be
tried
in
places
outside
of
the
district
court.
in
other
words
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
define
that
murder
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
tell
me
what
is
(inaudible)?
in
the
structure,
in
the
--
the
significant
in
the
structure
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
in
the
method
of
administering
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
draw
your
distinction
there
between
a
misdemeanor
and
something
else.
suppose
its
murder,
what's
the
difference?
what
could
be
the
difference
as
the
way
it
functions?
someone
will
operate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
forgetting
the
word
legislative
article
iii
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
everything
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
though
it
could
--
the
cases
could
be
tried
differently
as
the
man
and
the
people
in
other
states
and
places,
had
to
be
tried
by
the
federal
court
one
way
for
their
crime
but
could
be
tried
a
different
way,
crime
generally
could
be
tried
a
different
way
in
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
talking
about
how
it
is
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it's
a
murder,
are
you
taking,
as
i
gather,
you
have
drawn
in
distinction
between
the
way
people
could
decide
constitutionally
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
district
and
outside.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
there
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
--
is
your
case
dependent
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
argument
has
been
made
on
the
side
you
are
on,
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
people
charged
with
felony
or
a
crime
can
be
tried
one
way
under
the
constitution
in
the
district
of
columbia,
another
way
in
the
--
outside
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
the
disadvantage
of
either
that
would
raise
different
questions
so
far
as
i'm
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
intend
evidently.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
trying
to
find
what
you
meant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
to
be
tried
by
a
judge
not
appointed
for
life
as
independent
as
you
know
constitutionally
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
right
to
there
--
in
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
hope
it's
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
can't
see
is
that
if
the
whole
argument
is
based
on
that
assumption
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
is
not
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
my
problem.
justice
hugo
l.
black
sometimes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
sometimes
they
say
that
congress
could
not
do
it
that
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
a
state
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
district
of
columbia
is
not
a
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
--
if
by
that
is
mean
that
people
in
the
district
must
be
--
can
be
tried
for
crimes
precisely
the
argument
in
state,
they
can
be
tried
in
the
state
according
to
this
court's
previous
opinion
without
an
indictment,
without
a
jury
and
as
you
say
without
judge
appointed
for
life.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
that
can
--
that
the
people
of
the
district
can
be
tried
without
juries?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
--
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
--
they
can
in
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then
of
course,
you
are
not
saying
that
the
people
here
can
be
tried
as
they
are
tried
in
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
according
to
a
pick
and
choose
method.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
one
thought
that
the
bill
of
rights
including
your
whole
constitution,
includes
the
right
to
be
tried
by
a
judge
appointed
for
life
independently
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
which
opinion
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
justice
jackson's
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
i
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
justice
vinson's
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
tried
to
make
three
and
three,
you
mean
to
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
a
good
mathematician.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
say
that
was
equal,
certainly
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
what
do
you
attribute
his
life
tenure
now
and
his
power
to
hold
for
life?
to
what
do
you
exercise
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
say
he
has
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
he
has
a
statutory
and
not
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
constitutional
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
life
tenure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
stating
to
me
in
a
sentence
if
you
could,
why,
if
you
accept
as
fully
valid
the
statement
in
sherwood,
forget
all
about
dictum
or
whatever
view
points
of
it,
you
accept
it
now,
why
do
you
say
it
necessarily
follows
that
judge
madden's
precedents
and
the
--
this
court
should
invalidate
the
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
of
life
--
you
mean
of
life
tenure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
consider
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
consider
it
the
same
as
though
the
congress
had
passed
the
law
which
said
that
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
should
not
have
life
tenure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
as
though
you
would
say
that
if
they
assign
eight,
they
have
five
judges
from
the
court
of
claims
so
that
the
court
would
have
five
people
there
who
did
not
have
constitutional
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
life
tenure
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
security
of
salary
and
therefore
they
could
not
sit
in
that
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
take
the
court
of
claims,
i
assume,
as
being
a
court
by
the
congress
has
selected
these
people
to
serve
it
and
deciding
who
it
would
pay
what
it
owed
if
it
does
owe
and
accept
them
or
reject
them.
and
that
it
could
be
the
same
whether
they
call
them
a
court
or
commission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
a
committee
of
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
same
as
giving
the
power,
i
assume
you
would
say
to
the
finance
committee
or
the
court
--
the
committee
on
claims
in
the
senate,
giving
them
life
tenure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
here
appointed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
can
testify
that's
a
heavy
burden
of
tenure
service
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you,
am
i
wrong
in
taking
that
the
court
has
--
that
the
congress
has
now
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
about
it,
provided
military
courts
of
appeals
with
life
tenure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
done
that
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
term
do
they
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
assume
that
they
are
right,
just
assuming
that,
and
telling
the
court
its
different,
just
assume
that,
you
assume
they
are
right
in
saying
that
--
that
no
judge
of
the
court
of
claims
has
constitutional
rights
to
sit
on
the
court
of
appeals,
suppose
all
three
of
them
have
been
judges
of
court
of
claims,
would
you
still
say
they'd
have
to
raise
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
that
congress
had
provided
that
united
states
commissioners
could
be
designated,
they
had
their
jobs
for
life.
would
say
they
could
sit,
could
have
to
be
no
(inaudible)
there
has
to
be
challenge?
justice
hugo

black
and
where
would
you
draw
the
lines,
suppose
of
the
court
of
military
appeals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose,
they
give
them
life
tenure.
justice

black
they
had
legislated
life
tenure,
you
mean.
justice

not
constitutionally.
justice

does
that
--
justice

settle
it?
justice

black
does
that
settle
it?
does
that
settle
the
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
agree
or
disagree
with
the
statement
that
article
iii
at
least
contemplates
that
this
shall
be
some
courts
exercising
some
kind
of
judicial
power
where
the
judges
have
to
be
appointed
for
life
and
where
they
cannot
have
their
salaries
reduced?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
agree
that
congress
could've
exalt
this,
create
new
courts,
legislative
courts
so
that
they
can
take
the
place
of
all
the
courts
that
heretofore
have
had
judges
appointed
for
life
just
by
naming
other
courts.
saying
they
could
have
a
job
for
life,
congress
could
thereby
do
away
with
any
courts
under
cons
--
under
article
iii.
justice
hugo

black
and
--
and
granted
them
by
legislative
exercise
of
legislative
power,
life
tenure
which
could
be
taken
away
tomorrow.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
to
be
appointed
for
life
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
do
be
appointed
for
life
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
follow
from
that
that
the
congress
has
power
to
create
courts
to
try
murder
cases,
contract
cases,
all
other
kinds
of
litigation
between
different
parties
and
provide
that
they
shall
not
have
tenure
for
life.
does
that
follow
from
the
fact
that
they
can
abolish
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
other
things?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
follow
constitutionally?
justice

black
does
that
mean
that
in

to
sustain
your
position,
bakelite
and
williams
must
be
overruled?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo

black
of
the
1953
act,

an
act
of

providing
for
that
which
these

i
read
them,
indicated
was
required
by
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
you
leave
the
indian
business,
i
may
say
that
i
think
there
has
been
a
question
raised
about
that
being
judicial
whether
that's
a
power
to
exercise
in
a
judicial
way
or
just
under
the
power
of
congress
to
give
away
its
fund

it
wishes?
