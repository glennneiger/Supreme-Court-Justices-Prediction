mr.
bordeau,
this
was
a
lawsuit
for
violation
of
collective
bargaining
agreement,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
are
those
then
involved
something
over
which
is
the
function
and
power
of
congress?
what
i
have
in
mind,
for
example,
that
in
the
enactment
of
the
taft?hartley
act
in
1947.
it
was
proposed
that
violations
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
be
made
unfair
labor
practices
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
no
--
the
congress
can
do
that
but
you're
suggesting
that
that's
--
that
would
have
been
somehow
improper
or
unconstitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
why
this
particular
lawsuit
has
to
be
in
an
article
iii
court
even
under
your
very
definition.
justice
potter
stewart
why
was
that
in
the
federal
court?
was
there
a
diversity
of
citizenship?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
under
section
301.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
to
doing
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
congress
not
only
could
do
it
but
did
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
19th
century.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
ever
in
fact
happen?
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
be
--
what
would
be
your
point
mr.
solicitor
general
that
the
--
the
judges
could
simply
decline
if
they
wanted
to
to
perform
their
--
justice
potter
stewart
congressional
reference
function?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it's
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
grace
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
would
there
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
would
there
be
doubt
if
it
did
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
if
it
did
do
that.
if
it
gave
--
if
it
set
up
a
tribunal
and
denominated
it
a
court
and
gave
it
only
tucker
act
jurisdiction,
would
congress
have
the
power
to
--
to
provide
that
the
members
of
that
tribunal
should
have
anything
else
except
life
tenure?
justice
potter
stewart
well
mr.
shea,
what
about
the
municipal
court
of
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
national
parts,
their
commissioners
will
agree
on
judicial
power
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
that
couldn't
constitutionally
be.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
done
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
was
it
not?
