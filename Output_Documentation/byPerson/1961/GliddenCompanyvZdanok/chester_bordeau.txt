mr.
chester
bordeau
mr.
chief
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
many
of
the
arguments
that
i
have
prepared
for
this
court
have
been
more
or
less
discussed
in
the
previous
argument
but
i
would
like
to
answer
some
of
the
various
questions
that
were
put
or
at
least
to
try
to
answer
them
in
a
way
that
i
see
them.
as
your
honors
know,
this
case
involves
a
controversy
between
former
employees
of
the
glidden
company,
the
petitioner
here.
it
was
the
claim
of
these
respondents
that
there
was
a
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
covering
these
employees
while
they
were
employed
at
the
elmhurst
plant
of
the
petitioner
in
long
island.
when
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
expired
and
when
the
plant
was
closed
and
when
the
employment
of
the
employee
thus
terminated,
a
claim
was
then
made
by
the
employees
that
by
reason
of
certain
seniority
rights
contained
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
they
were
entitled
to
be
employed
or
continued
in
the
employ
of
the
petitioner
at
a
new
plant
which
the
petitioner
had
established
in
bethlehem,
pennsylvania.
they
were
not
given
this
right
to
continue
in
employment
with
the
--
the
seniority
rights
which
they
claim
have
accrued.
the
case
was
brought
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
and
was
removed
by
the
petitioner
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
with
the
claim
that
there
was
a
diversity
of
citizenship
in
the
requisite
amount
in
controversy.
and
now
in
this
case
of
--
at
the
trial
term
which
was
held
before
the
honorable
edmund
palmieri,
a
judgment
was
entered
dismissing
the
complaint.
an
appeal
was
taken
by
the
respondents
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
second
circuit.
that
appeal
was
argued
before
the
honorable
j.
edward
lumbard,
the
chief
judge
of
that
court
and
a
circuit
judge
before
the
honorable
j.
warren
madden
of
the
united
states
court
of
claims,
who
have
been
designated
by
the
chief
justice
to
sit
on
the
appeal
in
this
case
during
that
one
week
in
february
1961.
now,
the
third
judge
in
the
division
which
heard
this
appeal
was
honorable
sterry
waterman
of
vermont.
the
result
of
the
hearing
before
the
appellate
court
was
that
judge
madden
wrote
the
majority
opinion
in
which
he
reversed
the
lower
court
and
remanded
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
he
was
joined
in
that
reversal
by
judge
waterman.
the
--
judge
lumbard
dissented
in
an
opinion.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
judge
madden
as
a
judge
of
the
court
of
claims
was
not
an
article
iii
judge
that
we
have
petitioned
in
part.
there
were
other
reasons
why
we
made
a
petition
to
this
court
or
the
declaration
by
this
court
that
the
court
has
constituted
and
as
the
decision
occurred
was
without
jurisdiction
to
render
the
judgment
against
the
petitioner
here.
judge
madden
was
appointed
by
president
roosevelt
in
1941.
a
copy
of
the
commission
is
at
--
appears
at
page
7
of
our
main
brief.
he
was
designated
to
the
office
or
nominated
rather
to
the
office
of
the
judge
of
the
court
of
claims
upon
the
duties
and
the
services
of
the
judge
of
that
court.
in
1961,
the
chief
justice
in
a
designation
and
assignment
which
appear
as
an
appendix
to
our
main
brief
assigned
that
judge
madden
to
sit
as
a
circuit
judge
in
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
there
is
no
question
presented
here
as
to
the
regularity
of
the
assignment
and
designation
made
by
the
chief
justice.
there
were
no
in
--
no
defects
in
the
carrying
out
the
regulation
of
the
statute
permitting
the
assignment.
it
is
the
claim
of
the
petitioner
that
the
statute
pursuant
to
which
the
chief
justice
maybe
assigned
and
then
designation
of
judge
madden
to
sit
in
the
article
iii
court
is
unconstitutional.
in
that,
judge
madden
was
the
judge
of
an
article
i
court
without
the
constitutional
protection
which
is
granted
to
article
iii
judges
under
the
provision
of
section
1
of
article
iii.
mr.
chester
bordeau
we
say
under
the
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
that
the
question
--
there's
a
question
of
jurisdiction
of
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
not
only
with
respect,
the
solicitor
talks
about
subject
matter.
we're
talking
about
the
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
judges
seating.
that
is
also
an
important
consideration
and
just
as
important
in
consideration
under
the
subject
matter
or
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
of
a
case
before
a
court.
that
is
been
held
uniformly,
maybe
raised
at
any
time.
that
is
a
jurisdictional
defect
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
constitutional
defect.
mr.
chester
bordeau
we
did
not
raise
it,
sir,
until
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
presented
to
this
court
along
with
request
for
the
review
of
various
other
question
which
with
respect
to
which
the
petition
was
denied.
now,
judge
madden,
as
i
pointed
out,
was
appointed
to
the
u.s.
court
of
claims.
he
was
not
appointed
at
any
time
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
or
any
other
district
or
the
article
iii
court.
his
appointment
was
to
a
court
which
had
been
declared
unanimously
by
this
court
to
be
an
article
i
court.
a
court
that
did
not
have
the
constitutional
guarantee
with
respect
to
tenure
of
office
and
compensation
provided
for
with
respect
to
article
iii
judges.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
that's
a
very,
very
good
question
that
i've
asked
myself
that
question
over
and
over
again.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
depending
on
which
side
the
court
may
feel
the
correct
answer
to
be
is
decisive.
i
have
tried
to
frame
that.
i've
tried
to
frame
it
probably
a
little
imperfectly
at
pages
7
and
8
of
my
reply
brief
which
i
would
like
to
clarify
by
a
statement
running
like
this,
"an
article
i
court
is
one
granted
by
congress
the
power
and
the
function
to
determine
judicially
matters
which
are
inherently
susceptible
to
congressional
determination
under
article
i
and
or,
if
i
may
use
that
phrase,
to
deal
with
those
matters
non-judicially
which
are
within
the
power
and
the
function
of
the
congress
and
all
of
which
may
be
delegable
by
congress."
that
is
what
i
gather
from
the
various
decisions
which
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
read.
and
carrying
on
from
there
to
try
to
describe
an
article
iii
court,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
follow
up
on
your
question,
and
article
iii
court
on
the
other
hand
is
one
granted
by
congress
the
power
and
the
function
to
determine
judicially
cases
or
controversies
described
in
section
2.
mr.
chester
bordeau
this
is
article
iii
i'm
describing
to
you
now,
sir.
mr.
chester
bordeau
it
was
our
case
ruled
by
a
reason
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
entered
into
between
an
employer,
the
petitioner
and
the
collective
bargaining
agent
representing
the
employees
of
that
employer.
there's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
a
state
law
or
federal
law.
we
claim
before
this
court
on
our
petition
for
certiorari
that
it
was
a
federal
substantive
labor
law
question
with
reference
to
which
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
decision
that
i
ask
this
court
therefore
to
review.
but
that
petition
was
denied.
now
--
but
that
is
the
nature
of
the
question.
it
does
not
arise
under
the
constitution.
it
may
have
a
reason
as
we
claim
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
does
that
answer
you
mr.
justice
whittaker?
may
i
proceed
then
with
the
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
what
i
gather
from
the
cases
as
to
what
an
article
iii
court
is.
and
this
will
be
slightly
repetitive.
and
article
iii
court
is
one
granted
by
congress
the
power
and
the
function
to
determine
judicially
cases
or
controversies
described
in
section
2
of
article
iii
arising
under
the
constitution
or
federal
laws
or
arising
under
other
laws
in
cases
of
diversity
of
citizenship
which
are
not
inherently
susceptible
to
congressional
determination.
now,
i
think
those
two
definitions
describe
the
differences
and
the
characteristics
of
an
article
i
and
an
article
ii
court.
a
question
which
is
posed
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
lurk
case
in
asking
what
are
the
characteristics
of
the
different
courts
in
which
we
are
dealing.
i
think
this
definition,
which
i
have
submitted
in
this
form,
is
an
attempt
to
describe
what
the
courts
have
said
in
making
the
distinction
between
article
i
and
article
iii
courts.
and
i
think,
it
is
a
distinction
which
is
solved
for
there
is
no
reason
in
my
mind
why
congress
should
not
have
the
privilege
and
the
right
to
have
courts
or
tribunals
which
are
subject
to
its
whim,
we
call
it
that
with
respect
to
their
tenure
of
office,
with
respect
to
their
compensation.
if
they
--
because
of
this
fact
that
this
courts
which
are
created
by
congress
under
article
i
had
been
created
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
powers
and
the
functions
of
congress
and
not
any
other
branch
of
government,
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
power
and
the
function
of
congress
of
the
court
of
claims
was
established
in
1854
or
1855.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
debates
which
appeared
in
the
congressional
glow.
it
was
emphasized
throughout
the
many
and
many
pages
of
discussion
with
respect
to
the
establishment
of
the
court
of
claims
that
it
was
being
created
because
of
the
very
heavy
duty
of
burden
which
have
been
placed
upon
the
congress
in
passing
upon
bills
relating
to
compensation
and
debts
owing
by
the
united
states
to
individuals
and
others.
mr.
chester
bordeau
this
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
case.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i'm
saying
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
because
i
say
this,
that
the
determination,
we've
got
to
keep
in
mind
of
course
that
no
one
has
agreed
to
the
position
which
we've
taken
that
this
is
a
federal
substance
of
labor
law
problem.
i
tried
to
persuade
this
court
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
yes,
diversity
of
citizenship.
so,
all
we
have
to
do
is
defend
it
with
the
question
under
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
rights
and
obligations
of
contracts.
mr.
chester
bordeau
then
--
i
--
i
didn't
get
that.
mr.
chester
bordeau
did
arise.
mr.
chester
bordeau
and
if
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
and
if
mr.
justice
stewart
says
that
congress
were
enact
--
to
enact
the
law
saying
that
a
refusal
or
rather
a
breach
of
a
--
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
i
would
say
we
are
--
we
are
wrong
in
our
position
here.
i
would
have
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
and
rather
(voice
overlap).
mr.
chester
bordeau
that
we
are
wrong
in
our
position
here
that
we
are
--
we
have
been
denied
of
our
constitutional
rights.
i
would
have
to
say
that
in
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
just
wonder
about
the
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
because
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
there
are
many
claims
that
are
made
by
citizens
with
res
--
under
the
constitution
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
which
come
under
the
power
of
congress
to
decide.
that
is,
for
instance,
the
claims
of
payments
of
the
debts
of
the
united
states.
mr.
chester
bordeau
no,
i'm
--
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
had
enough
(voice
overlap)
mr.
chester
bordeau
yes.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
don't
know
of
that
power
sir.
having
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
think
an
answer
to
that
would
be
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
well
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
we
all
have
the
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
under
article
i,
the
congress
has
the
power
to
pay
the
debts
of
the
united
states.
and
in
doing
so,
it
will
necessarily
have
to
pass
upon
and
considered
constitutional
provisions
and
the
provisions
of
--
of
various
legislation
that
maybe
enacted
by
congress
but
that
still
does
not
take
away
from
congress
under
article
i,
the
right
to
pay
the
debts
of
the
united
states
and
in
doing
so
--
and
in
doing
so
to
set
up
those
arms
of
congress
that
may
--
that
may
deem
appropriate
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
for
it
to
determine
those
questions.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
mr.
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
of
course
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
of
course,
the
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
powers
under
article
i
is
subject
to
all
the
other
provisions
of
limitation
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
they
are
to
deem
the
constitution.
mr.
chester
bordeau
but
i
--
in
your
honor's
statement,
it
seems
to
be
--
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
pause
runs
through
it
as
being
more
or
less
conclusive
in
your
mind
is
a
the
fact
that
a
court
is
creative.
now,
i
think
the
term
"court"
in
itself
does
not
necessarily
decide
the
question.
you
may
have
a
court
under
article
i.
you
may
have
a
court
under
article
iii.
you
may
call
it
a
tribunal.
you
may
call
it
an
agency.
but
the
fact
still
remains
that
a
court
is
not
the
determining
factor
in
my
mind
because
a
court
has
certain
powers.
the
court
has
certain
functions.
and
i
think
in
determining
this,
what
are
those
powers
and
what
are
those
functions.
the
way
you
would
tell
the
character
and
the
characteristics
of
a
person
is
by
what
he
does,
what
is
he
empowered
to
do,
not
what
he
is
called
but
what
he
does.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that
is
determining
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
think
that
maybe
so.
but
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
prevent
the
conception
of
the
disinc
--
distinction
between
article
i
and
article
iii
courts
and
those
that
are
performing
functions
of
congress.
mr.
chester
bordeau
those
--
this
court
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
where
is
the
line
(voice
overlap)
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
that
is
--
this
test
to
which
i
refer
is
the
test
which
i
think
we
must
have
if
we're
going
to
determine
that
they
are
legislative
courts
in
article
i
courts,
they
are
article
iii
courts.
there
is
going
to
be
a
way
of
our
deciding
which
is
an
article
i
and
which
is
an
article
iii
because
we
would
never
know.
i
think
there's
sometime
that
we
ought
to
know
what
kind
of
court
it
is.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
that
congress
can,
in
the
exercise
of
its
powers
under
article
i,
may
give
the
execution
of
those
powers
to
article
iii
courts.
mr.
chester
bordeau
but
i
don't
think
that
in
itself
would
make
the
court,
an
article
iii
court
because,
in
my
mind,
the
determining
test
is
what
power
is
being
used.
what
power
under
the
government
is
being
used?
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
the
way
my
mind
works
on
it
is
article
i
or
article
iii.
there
have
to
be
a
division
of
--
of
--
the
type
of
court
that
you
have.
mr.
chester
bordeau
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chester
bordeau
on
our
last
session
which
was
on
wednesday,
february
21st,
we
were
in
this
posture
that
mr.
justice
whittaker,
as
i
recall,
had
put
the
question
as
to
what
was
an
article
i
court.
and
i
made
reply
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
whittaker
by
stating
that
in
my
opinion,
from
the
rulings
made
by
this
court
in
bakelite
and
in
williams,
that
the
answer
was
a
--
that
article
i
court
was
a
court
which
performed
the
functions
and
the
powers
of
congress.
functions
which
were
cognizable
by
congress.
functions
and
powers
which
were
susceptible
of
performance
by
congress
and
not
requiring
judicial
determination.
i
think
that
is
a
rule
that
might
be
deduced
from
the
statements
of
this
court
in
the
bakelite
and
in
the
williams
cases.
i
believe
that
the
rules
stated
there
are
sound.
i
believe
that
they
are
sound
for
these
reasons.
in
that
--
in
those
cases,
there
was
a
very
careful
review
made
by
the
members
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
history
and
res
--
and
with
respect
to
the
powers
and
functions
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
established,
i
submit,
that
the
court
of
claims
performed
only
those
functions
and
powers
which
were
adherently
the
functions
and
powers
of
congress
under
article
i.
i
think
it
was
established
also
the
--
from
the
debates
of
the
congress
in
1854
and
1855
that
the
purpose
for
the
creation
of
the
court
of
claims
was
to
relieve
the
congress
of
the
heavy
burden
which
had
come
upon
it
by
reason
of
presentation
of
bills.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
believe
the
--
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
definitely.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
know.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
frankly,
we
didn't
know
about
it,
that's
a
frank
answer
to
your
question.
we
did
not
know
about
it.
the
--
our
case
was
argued
in
february
of
1961.
and
i
believe
that
the
petition
in
the
lurk
case
was
on
may
29,
1961,
some
two
or
three
months
later.
but
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
didn't
know
of
the
existence
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
of
this
objection.
mr.
chester
bordeau
now,
in
1929,
the
bakelite
case.
decided
in
1933,
the
williams
case.
mr.
chester
bordeau
those
debates
show,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
purpose
--
the
purpose,
which
was
referred
to
over
and
over
again
in
the
debates
in
1854
or
1855
was
to
create
a
court
for
the
purpose
of
relieving
the
congress
of
the
very
heavy
burdens
which
have
been
placed
upon
it
in
connection
with
the
presentation
of
bills
for
the
payments
of
moneys
or
payments
of
debts
of
the
united
states
and
the
consideration
thereof.
i
have
a
--
at
page
--
i
think
it's
one
--
page
16.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
believe
the
--
i
submit
the
answer
could
be
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
congress
could
have
delegated
to
the
inferior
courts
created
by
congress
under
article
iii
the
performance
of
the
function
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
believe
it
does,
sir.
mr.
chester
bordeau
and
for
this
reason
that
in
the
creation
of
inferior
courts
and
the
establishment
of
this
inferior
courts
under
article
iii,
i
submit
that
the
distinction
in
carrying
between
the
two
courts
is
this,
that
an
article
iii
court
possesses
the
power
and
the
function
to
pass
upon
cases
and
controversies
which
are
not
susceptible
to
determination
by
an
article
i
court
that
would
be,
for
instance,
a
--
a
controversy
between
the
parties
in
this
case.
the
glidden
company
and
the
zdanok
an
agree
--
a
breach
of
contract
case,
a
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
i
say
that
type
of
case,
of
course,
could
not
be
heard
or
determined
by
congress.
mr.
chester
bordeau
is
not
cognizable
by
it.
is
not
susceptible
to
determination
by
congress
and
it
requires
a
suggestion
in
the
bakelite
and
williams
cases
a
judicial
determination
under
article
iii,
a
court
that
determines
cases
and
controversies
which
are
not
susceptible
and
which
are
not
cognizable
by
an
article
iii
cou
--
or
by
congress.
mr.
chester
bordeau
(voice

mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
that
i
understand
your
question
but
i
will
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
article
iii
which
prevents
congress
from
vesting
in
an
article
iii
court
the
performance
of
some
of
the
functions
and
powers
which
are
susceptible
of
performance
by
the
congress.
i
don't
believe
that's
true.
but
i
think
if
we're
going
to
have
legislative
courts
and
article
iii
court
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
well
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
what
makes
the
legislative
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
in
my
thinking
your
honor?
mr.
chester
bordeau
(voice
overlap)
--
i
think
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
say
where
a
court
performs
solely
those
functions
which
are
the
functions
of
congress
that
that
court
is
an
article
i
court,
where
it
performs
those
functions
inherently
the
functions
and
the
powers
of
congress
under
article
i
and
nothing
else.
i
say
that
court
is
an
article
i
court.
mr.
chester
bordeau
it's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
it
is
not
a
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
don't
see
it's
not
a
court.
mr.
chester
bordeau
it's
not
an
article
iii
court.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
get
that
from
article
iii
from
the
decisions
made
by
this
court.
mr.
chester
bordeau
and
--
well,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
address
myself
to
as
to
the
soundness
of
the
rulings
of
this
court
in
bakelite
and
in
williams
and
in
the
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
to
which
reference
was
made
the
mem
--
some
of
the
members
of
this
court
who
are
sitting
here
today.
i
--
if
i
may
proceed
from
that
point,
in
the
year
1941,
this
court
had
before
it
the
case
of
sherwood
against
the
united
states.
on
that
court,
mr.
justice
black
sat,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
sat
and
mr.
justice
douglas
sat.
and
that
court
had
before
it
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
united
states
district
court
could
entertain
jurisdiction
of
a
suit
commenced
by
a
judgment
creditor
of
a
claimant
against
the
united
states,
a
claimant
who
had
claim
under
the
tucker
act.
the
court
held
that
this
court
could
not
--
the
u.s.
district
court
could
not
entertain
jurisdiction
of
such
a
suit.
the
reason
being
that
in
that
suit,
they
had
to
be
made
a
defendant
another
party,
that
was
the
judgment
debtor.
and
it
was
stated
by
this
court
that
in
view
of
that
additional
feature,
that
someone
else
had
to
be
made
a
party
defendant
to
that
lawsuit
meant
that
we
did
not
have
just
a
clear
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
where
the
united
states
could
be
sued.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that
citation
is
312
u.s.,
your
honor.
now,
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
stone
delivered
the
opinion
of
the
court.
and
i
would
just
like
to
quote
very
briefly
from
the
statement
concurred
in
by
unanimous
court
incidentally.
as
i
say
concurred
in
by
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
douglas
--
justice
douglas.
the
court
acclaimed
it
is
a
legislative
not
a
constitutional
court.
its
judicial
power
is
derived
not
from
the
judiciary
article
of
the
constitution
but
from
the
congressional
parter
--
power
to
pay
the
debts
of
united
states
which
it
is
free
to
exercise
through
judicial
as
well
as
through
non-judicial
agencies.
that
was
concurred
in
as
i
--
unanimous
opinion
concurred
in
by
your
honor,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
don't
think
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
won't
agree
to
that.
now,
in
1949,
this
court
also
had
another
case.
mr.
chester
bordeau
with
the
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
judge
stone?
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
the
decision
in
the
sherwood
case
is
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
unrelated
to
this
problem
but
i
think
that
the
statements
which
i
have
read
were
appropriate
and
necessary
considerations
on
the
part
of
this
court
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
to
which
it
gave.
now,
in
1949,
this
court
had
before
it
the
national
merit
--
what's
the
name
of
that
case?
mr.
chester
bordeau
the
national
mutual
insurance
company
against
the
tidewater.
your
honors
will
recall
that
in
that
case,
there
were
four
opinions
written.
there
were
two
majority
opinions
and
two
dissenting
opinions.
mr.
chester
bordeau
if
you
may
call
on
that.
mr.
chester
bordeau
yes.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
exactly
correct.
now,
in
that
--
in
that
case,
--
in
that
case,
your
honors,
there
was
reference
made
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
jackson
who
wrote
one
of
the
prevailing
opinions,
joined
in
by
mr.
justice
black
and
by
mr.
justice
burton.
there
was
a
concurring
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
rutledge
concurred
in
by
mr.
justice
murphy.
a
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
chief
justice
vinson,
joined
in
by
mr.
justice
douglas.
and
another
dissenting
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
concurred
in
by
mr.
justice
reed.
now,
in
that
case,
references
were
made
to
the
determination
made
by
this
court
in
the
bakelite
and
in
the
williams
cases.
there
was
no
disapproval
of
the
rulings
made
by
this
court
in
the
bakelite
and
williams
cases
except
possibly
with
respect
to
a
matter
to
which
i
shall
refer
later
in
our
argument
but
i
will
advert
to
very
briefly
at
this
time.
and
that
is
that
there
was
disagreement
with
the
expressions
contained
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
sutherland
in
the
williams
case
to
the
effect
that
that
provision
in
article
iii,
section
2
of
article
iii
providing
for
controversies
to
which
the
united
states
to
be
a
party.
with
reference
to
which
mr.
justice
sutherland
stated
that
that
was
to
be
construed
that
where
the
united
states
was
a
party
plaintiff
and
not
a
party
defendant.
now,
that
statement
in
the
williams
case
was
not
approved
by
the
members
of
this
court
in
the
discussions
in
the
tidewater
case
but
it
defies
the
holding
that
the
court
of
claims
was
a
legislative
court.
there
was
no
expressions
contained
in
any
of
the
opinions
in
that
case
although
reference
was
made
to
the
williams
case
as
to
its
not
being
approved
by
this
court.
now,
an
attempt
is
now
being
made
to
overrule
or
to
have
this
court
or
to
ask
this
court
to
overrule
both
the
bakelite
and
the
williams
case,
the
williams
case
in
which
i
am
particularly
interested.
one
of
the
first
reason
that
it
is
urged
for
the
overruling
of
the
williams
case
is
this,
it
is
said
that
the
--
this
court
in
the
williams
case,
disregarded
the
earlier
rulings
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
court
of
claims,
if
not
the
rulings
at
least
the
views
expressed
by
this
court
with
respect
to
the
court
of
claims.
now,
the
fact
is
that
in
the
cases
earlier
like
bakelite
or
williams,
there
was
no
discussion,
there
was
no
consideration
of
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
of
claims
was
an
article
i
or
an
article
iii
court.
there
were
statements
made
by
members
of
the
court
to
the
effect
that
the
court
of
claims
was
a
constitutional
or
article
iii
court.
but
there
was
no
discussion
in
the
briefs.
there
was
no
discussion
in
the
opinions
and
no
consideration
given
to
the
specific
point
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
of
claims
was
an
article
i
or
an
article
iii
court.
it
was
not
until
1929
when
this
court
considered
the
bakelite
case
where
the
very
full
discussion
was
given
with
respect
to
the
united
states
court
of
customs
and
appeal
or
custom
appeals
was
engaged
in
and
also
a
very
thorough
discussion
with
respect
to
the
court
of
claims.
what
was
said
of
course
with
respect
to
the
court
of
claims
was
very
enlightening
and
very
inspective
but
was
not
before
the
court
in
the
bakelite
case.
although
it
was
so
inherent
and
so
inter-involved
with
the
determination
as
to
what
the
u.s.
customs
and
court
of
appeals
was,
i
believe
it
was
proper,
quite
proper
for
a
full
discussion
to
be
made
with
respect
to
the
court
of
claims.
and
in
1933,
of
course,
there
was
a
specific
consideration
of
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
of
claims
was
an
article
i
or
an
article
iii
court.
for
in
that
case
--
for
in
that
case
that
this
court
had
for
determination
whether
or
not
legislation
which
had
been
passed
providing
for
the
reduction
in
the
pay
and
the
remuneration
and
compensation
of
judges
of
the
court
of
claims
could
be
effectively
made.
it
was
urged
on
behalf
of
judge
williams
who
was
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
in
the
court
of
claims
which
was
moved
to
this
court
immediately,
that
he
was
a
constitutional
or
article
iii
court
judge.
and
therefore,
under
the
provisions
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
guaranteeing
him
life
tenure
and
irreducibility
in
salary
or
compensation
that
this
legislation
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
chester
bordeau
the
question
was
squarely
put
in
that
case
and
squarely
considered
and
squarely
and
fully
briefed
by
the
parties
to
the
suit.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
don't
know
that
so
anymore,
your
honor.
i
think
that
was
true
at
one
time.
i
don't
think
that's
true
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
the
judgments
today
and
they
have
been
for
some
years
have
been
final.
i
don't
think
they're
subject
to
the
approval
of
congress
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
appropriation
may
be
necessary
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
for
purpose
of
carrying
the
judgment
into
effect.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
true
in
article
iii
courts,
too,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
judgments
against
the
united
states
in
an
article
iii
court.
there
still
has
to
be
appropriations
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
before
any
judgment
can
be
paid.
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
but
i
think
that's
also
true
if
i
--
if
i
may
submit.
i
think
that's
also
true
of
judgments
that
may
be
entered
in
article
iii
courts
in
(inaudible)
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
i
--
i
agree
with
that
and
i
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
and
that
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
that
may
be
--
that
may
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
i
think
--
i
think
its
part
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
mean
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
no.
mr.
chester
bordeau
but
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
--
i'm
afraid
of
this
sir
in
--
that
in
your
statement,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
is
a
statement
of
the
fact
that
with
respect
to
judgments
entered
in
the
court
of
claims,
that
an
appropriation
is
still
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
satisfying
the
judgment.
and
i
may
be
wrong
about
this
but
i
think
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
judgments
entered
against
the
united
states
in
the
u.s.
district
court.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well
i
think
--
i
think
there
is
subs
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
only
against
the
united
states.
mr.
chester
bordeau
and
it's
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
pardon?
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
not.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
i
have
listed,
mr.
justice
clark,
in
my
--
the
appendix
to
our
main
brief
the
various
jurisdictional
matters
that
are
granted
to
the
court
of
claims
and
i
don't
see
anything
about
taxes
there.
i
don't
re
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh
yes,
that
could
be.
that's
correct.
well,
that's
under
the
general
provision
about
your
laws
of
united
states.
yes,
that's
correct.
but
not
a
specific
provision
about
tax
claims
like
the
tax
court
that
has
a
provision
for
its
considered
tax
claims.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
am
not
too
sure
about
that,
sir.
now,
as
i
say
one
of
the
reasons
that's
been
urged
for
the
overruling
of
the
williams
case
has
been
this
alleged
disregard
of
the
earlier
cases.
i
just
part
--
tried
to
meet
it
if
i
may,
the
objections
that
have
been
made
to
the
williams
case
and
the
reasons
that
it
have
been
urged
here
for
the
overruling
of
the
williams
case.
the
first
has
been,
as
i
suggested,
that
the
williams
case
did
not
follow
the
previous
statements
of
observation
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
court
of
claims
but
i
say
that
is
not
true.
it's
true
that
there
were
observations
and
statements
made
by
courts
with
respect
to
the
court
of
claims
and
being
a
--
an
article
iii
or
constitutional
court
but
it
was
only
in
bakelite
and
in
williams
that
you
have
the
square
presentation
of
the
issue
and
the
consideration
of
the
question
and
where
the
question
was
fully
mooted
and
fully
considered
and
decided
by
unanimous
court.
now,
it
has
also
been
urged
that
williams
should
be
overruled
for
this
reason.
it
is
urged
that
in
the
williams
case,
it
was
stated
by
the
unanimous
court
there
that
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
court
of
claims
performed
solely
congre
--
congressional
matters,
susceptible
to
congressional
dissemination,
that
in
that
case,
it
was
stated
by
mr.
justice
sutherland
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
courts
up
here
--
that
the
united
states
district
courts
did
not
have
jurisdiction
in
those
cases
where
the
united
states
was
a
defendant
under
that
clause
reading
controversies
to
which
the
united
states
shall
be
a
party.
it
was
stated
with
reference
to
that
clause
in
section
2
of
article
iii
by
mr.
justice
sutherland
that
under
that
clause,
the
united
states
could
not
be
sued
in
courts
created
by
congress
under
article
iii
because
it
was
not
contemplated
that
the
united
states
would
be
a
defendant
and
it's
through
to
that
sort.
now,
the
fact
is,
however,
that
in
the
williams
case,
the
statements
made
by
mr.
justice
sutherland
were
completely
unnecessary
to
that
opinion.
there
had
been
a
full
determination
and
discussion
made
by
the
court
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
the
court
of
claims
was
a
--
an
article
i
congressional
court
sitting
at
the
whim
and
will
of
congress,
performing
the
work
of
congress,
relieving
congress
of
its
burdens.
and
the
fact
that
it
was
unnecessary.
the
fact
that
it
was
dictum
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
chief
justice
vinson
in
the
tidewater
case,
pointed
out
in
the
footnote
at
page
640,
pointed
out
that
the
discussion
there
and
this
mr.
justice
black
joined
in
this
particular
opinion,
it
was
pointed
out
that
that
statement
by
mr.
justice
sutherland
was
unnecessary
and
was
dictum.
mr.
chester
bordeau
this
is
in
the
tidewater
case,
your
honor.
mr.
chester
bordeau
not
in
ju
--
justice
jackson
and
the
opinion
of
mr.
chief
justice
vinson,
think
that's
page
640.
and
i
believe
that
your
honor
concurred
in
the
--
that
opinion
of
mr.
chief
justice
vinson.
it
was
pointed
out
there
that
that
part
of
the
opinion
was
not
decisive
and
therefore
the
reason
urged
here
that
because
reference
was
made
to
that
fact
in
the
williams
case,
if
that
is
a
reason
for
the
overruling
of
the
williams
case,
i
think
is
that
with
much
merit.
mr.
chester
bordeau
yes.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
do
--
what
i
do
want
to
that
--
i'm
--
i
do
want
to
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
(inaudible)
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that
right
now
although
i
didn't
want
to
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
take
a
few
minutes
to
discuss
the
other
reasons
that
are
urged
for
the
overruling
of
the
bakelite
and
williams
cases
which
i
do
not
believe.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
--
if
it's
in
your
honor's
mind
right
now,
i
--
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
answer
it
right
away.
in
1953,
the
congress
enacted
an
amendment
to
section
171
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code
by
enacting
an
additional
sentence
to
provide
that
the
court
of
claims
is
hereby
declared
to
be
a
court
established
to
organize
whatever
particular
work
was
under
article
iii
that
was
in
1953.
in
1956,
and
again
by
additional
legislation
in
1958,
the
congress
enacted
legislation
which
came
out
in
the
form
of
section
293
(a)
of
title
28
of
the
judicial
code
to
provide
that
the
chief
justice
could
decide
a
justice
of
the
court
of
claim
or
a
judge
of
the
court
of
claims
to
serve
on
a
united
states
court
of
appeals
as
was
done
in
this
case
with
respect
to
mr.
--
to
judge
madden.
now,
it
is
our
intention
that
that
declaration
by
congress
in
1953
was
a
mere
declaration
without
any
effect.
the
legislation
of
1953
did
not
undertake
to
enlarge
the
powers
or
the
functions
of
the
court
of
claims.
it
did
nothing
but
spell
out
this
statement
a
label
that
that
it
wanted
to
give
to
the
court
of
claims.
it
gave
this
label
or
gave
this
additional
amendment
to
section
171
for
the
reason
of
attempting
to
repudiate
this
court's
determination.
this
court's
ruling
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
applications
of
the
act
in
effect
in
1932
which
mr.
--
judge
williams
attempted
to
have
declared
unconstitutional
in
the
williams
case.
now,
what
congress
has
done,
they
said,
we
will
supersede
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
and
we
will
interpret
the
constitution.
and
we
don't
agree
with
what
supreme
court
has
said
with
respect
to
the
constitution
and
we're
declaring
the
law
to
be
so
and
so.
we
say
that
is
a
repudiation,
a
futile
attempt
to
repudiate
the
rulings
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
constitution
and
is
completely
ineffective.
we
say
it's
also
ineffective
for
this
reason,
that
in
making
this
declaration
in
1953,
as
i
stated
before,
the
congress
did
not
enlarge
the
powers
or
functions
in
the
court
of
claims.
it's
been
our
contention
here
that
the
powers
and
the
functions
of
a
court
are
the
characteristics
which
determine
whether
it
is
an
article
i
or
article
iii
court.
that
was
the
test
that
was
laid
down
in
bakelite.
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
van
devanter
stated
that
the
test
is
not
what
in
--
what
the
intention
of
congress
was.
it
was
what
was
the
actual
jurisdiction
conferred
on
a
court.
what
were
the
powers?
what
were
the
functions
conferred
upon
a
court?
those
were
the
matters.
those
were
the
factors
which
determine
its
character
as
an
article
i
or
in
article
iii
court
and
not
what
congress
intended.
that
statement
again
was
then
adhered
to
by
mr.
chief
justice
vinson
in
the
tidewater
case
to
which
i
have
referred
and
it's
with
--
with
which
opinion
mr.
justice
black
concurred.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry.
what
i
said,
justice
black,
i
should
have
said
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i'm
sorry.
it's
mr.
justice
douglas
who
concurred
with
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
vinson.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
i
have
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
am
trying
to
address
myself
to
the
question
put
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
as
to
the
effect,
if
any,
of
the
amendment
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
its
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
there's
a
lot
of--
mr.
chester
bordeau
there
were
lots
of
--
lot
of
discussion
on
that
and
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
mr.
chester
bordeau
is
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
must
say--
mr.
chester
bordeau
but
there
was
full
discussion,
i
assume,
given
by
the
justices
of
this
court
that
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
was
considered
appropriate
for
the
occasion.
mr.
chester
bordeau
now,
i
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
don't
know
that
if
i
have
answered
the
specific
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
which
you
have
put
to
me
as
to
the
effect
if
any
of
the
legislation
passed
in
1953.
i
say
that
juri
--
that
legislation
accomplished
nothing.
its
--
was
a
pure
declaration
without
meaningful
action
taken
by
congress
that
is
meaningful
in
the
sense
that
there
was
a
conferring
by
congress
of
any
power
or
any
function
different
from
what
have
been
theretofore
conferred
upon
a
court
of
claims.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
must
say
that
in
the
presentation
of
this
argument
that
i
have
been
set
by
some
of
the
contrary
statements
and
conflicting
statements
that
are
made
by
this
court
and
i
have
been
a
little
confused
myself
in
trying
to
appreciate
the
full
meaning
of
what
has
been
said.
that
is
my
answer
to
the
question
with
respect
to
the
legislation
passed
in
1953.
now,
the
additional
legislation
passed
in
1956
and
in
1958
empowering
the
chief
justice
to
make
a
designation
and
assignment
of
a
judge
of
the
court
of
claims
to
sit
on
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
i
say,
is
unconstitutional
in
this
way
that
mr.
justice
or
judge
madden
rather
was
appointed
in
1941
confirmed
by
senate
to
a
court
--
a
court
of
claims.
clearly,
we
submit,
an
article
i
court
without
the
guaran
--
guarantee
of
life
tenure
and
irreducibility
in
compensation
that
his
assignment
to
sit
in
a
court
where
that
was
a
fundamental
and
basic
constitutional
requirement
is
--
was
an
unconstitutional
legislation
which
permitted
the
--
the
chief
justice
to
meet
this
assignment
and
designation.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
--
i
--
you
mean
judge
madden?
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
see
judge
madden
still
doesn't
have
it.
i
still
see
that
judge
madden
up
--
he's
still
sitting,
i
don't
know
if
he
resigned
or
not.
but
if
he
is
still
sitting,
he
didn't
--
retirement
or
otherwise
on
the
court
of
claims,
i
say
that
still
the
congress
may
repeal
the
statute
whereby
he
was
given
life
tenure
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
tenure
during
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
a
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
statutory
as
dis
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
perhaps
as
distinguished
from
constitutional.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
right.
and
i
say
it's
only
done
with
respect
to
judge
madden
and
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
or
the
next
congress
may
repeal
this
legislation.
and
we
must
keep
in
mind,
also,
that
in
this
legislation
which
purport
--
which
gave
judge
madden
life
tenure.
there
was
no
provision
as
contained
in
article
iii
with
respect
to
irreducibility
in
compensation
that
was
not
done.
and
yet
i
don't
think,
maybe
assumed
so
that
the
congress
could,
certainly
with
respect
to
the
compensation,
reduce
that
at
any
time.
and
i
think
they
could
do
the
same
with
respect
to
the
tenure
in
office.
there
is
no
statute
that
congress
passes
that
is
irrepealable.
every
congress
may
act
as
it
sees
fit
in
the
interest
of
the
public
as
it
should
be
--
is
required
to,
any
succeeding
congress
may
do
the
same.
mr.
chester
bordeau
for
this
reason
that
judge
madden
not
having
the
constitutional
guarantee
provided
for
by
article
iii
of
the
constitution
with
respect
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
of
life
tenure
and
irreducibility
in
compensation
not
having
that
and
his
sitting
on
a
court
where
upon
the
appointment
of
a
judge
to
that
court,
a
judge
immediately
becomes
vested
with
a
constitutional
guarantee
of
vesting
of
life
tenure
and
irreducibility
in
compensation.
and
i
--
i
go
on
from
there
to
say
that
a
litigant
properly
in
united
states
district
court,
properly
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
has
the
right,
the
constitutional
right
to
have
a
court
that
is
constituted
of
judges
who
possess
that
very
fundamental
qualification
under
article
iii.
and
that
a
denial
of
that
right
to
a
litigant
in
that
court
is
a
denial
of
the
protection
given
the
public
by
article
iii
with
respect
to
life
tenure
and
irreducibility
of
compensation
and
under
amendment
v
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
of
the
constitution.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct,
sir.
now,
i
don't
have
--
i
haven't
had
the
opportunity
to
discuss
all
of
the
reasons
why
i
think
that
the
grounds
urged
for
over
ruling.
mr.
chester
bordeau
it's
a
court.
i
think
it's
a
court.
they
are
courts
under
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
article
i.
mr.
chester
bordeau
they
are
courts
under
article
iii.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
--
i
don't
say--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
don't
see
irrelevant,
i
say
that
these
legislated
enactments
are
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
are
repealable.
they're
not
--
not
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that
is
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
and
i
think
that's
congress
should
have
the
right
to
have
a
court
or
an
agency
or
a
commission
or
a
board
to
relieve
it
of
the
heavy
burdens
that
it
has
in
the
performance
of
its
functions.
this
court,
that
is
a
court
of
claims
performs
one
of
those
functions.
mr.
chester
bordeau
not
having
been
honored
but
i've
heard
a
great
deal
about
it.
now,
as
i
--
in
a
few
remaining
minutes
that
i
have,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
very
briefly
to
the
question
that's
made
by
the
opposition
to
the
effect
that
we're
right
about
all
of
these
things.
and
the
court
was
improperly
constituted
and
so
forth
then
our
opponents
urged
--
well,
then
we
will
consider
judge
madden
as
a
de
facto
judge.
let
us
consider
him
that.
now,
the
cases
that
they
cite
with
respect
to
de
facto
are
cases,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
cases
where
there
have
been
omissions
to
carry
out
formalities
in
the
making
of
a
designation
or
an
assignment
of
a
judge.
they
have
not
been
cases
and
there
is
no
case
that
i
know
of
whether
you
have
what
we
have
here,
a
constitutional
impediment
on
the
part
of
judge
madden
in
sitting
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
