and
of
course
you
might
add
that
it
was
a
unanimous
decision
of
the
court
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
imposed
of
holmes

and
others
who

justice
william

mr.
solicitor
general,
i
don't
like
to
interfere
with
counsel
and
question
him
a
great
length
during
the
course
of
the
argument.
i
have
a
question
i
would
like
to
put
to
you.you
can
answer
it
in
due
course.
it
relates
somewhat
to
the
question
that
justice
black
asked.
i
once
served
on
the
security
exchange
commission
whether
the
--
i
was
wondering
during
the
course
of
the
argument
whether
congress
could
pass
a
law
that
would
allow
the
assignment
to
the
district
court
for
criminal
trials
or
civil
trials
in
the
district
of
columbia
members
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
we
have
the
--
we
used
to
handle
some
controversies
over
there,
cases
or
controversies
or
the
federal
trade
commission
or
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
with
or
without
the
commissioners
having
--
having
life
tenure.
whether
it
comes
down
to
this
which
seems
to
me
to
make
irrelevant
much
of
what
has
been
discussed
so
far,
namely
as
a
person
charged
with
a
crime,
entitle
to
a
--
not
only
to
article
iii
procedures
contained
in
the
constitution,
but
also
to
an
article
iii
judge.
justice
william
o.
douglas
don't
--
don't,
just
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
that's
the
heart
of
the
case
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
your
own
time.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
they
can
in
panel
a
jury.
justice
william
o.
douglas
they
can
--
they
might
use
a
jury.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
this
is
--
this
is
not
an
ad
hominem
a--
argument
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
was
the
citation
to
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course,
you
have
here
the
unique
fact
that
without
madden
there's
one
judge
on
each
side
of
the
question
below.
justice
william
o.
douglas
for
some
commiss
--
commissioners
do
--
perform
that
kind
of
business.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
had
one
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
had
one
case
where
the
question
arose
as
to
the
right
of
the
parties
to
get
interest
on
the
judgment.
you
remember
that
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
in
that
i
--
i
gather
we
ended
up
rather
sort
of
an
advisory
opinion.
justice
william
o.
douglas
knowing
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
we've
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
refused
the
allowance
of
interest.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
see
why
you
should
be
reluctant
to
get
into
that
field.
we've
been
in
and
out
of
it
for
several
times
in
the
last
few
days.
