mr.
morris
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
preliminarily
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
question
which
this
petitioner
has
raised
in
this
court
for
the
first
time,
is
a
question
that
he
can't
raise.
and
for
that
purpose,
we
associate
ourselves
fully
with
the
argument
made
by
solicitor
general
in
the
lurk
case
that
the
issue
of
judge
madden's
competence
to
sit
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
second
circuit
has
been
waived
by
not
being
raised
in
that
court
when
the
appeal
was
heard.
may
i
indicate
to
this
court
the
extent
of
the
neglect
of
this
petitioner
to
raise
that
question.
the
appeal
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
february
the
8th,
1961.
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
in
this
court
on
july
21st,
five
months
and
13
days
later.
that
was
the
first
time
this
issue
was
raised
by
the
petitioner.
it
is
no
answer
for
the
petitioner
to
say,
"we
weren't
aware
of
this
question.
we
didn't
know
about
the
issue
being
raised
in
the
lurk
case."
the
fact
is
that
the
issue
came
up
first
in
the
bakelite
case.
that
was
decided
in
1929
and
reported
in
the
official
reports.
it
was
followed
by
the
williams
case
in
1933
that
was,
likewise,
reported.
and
that
was
followed
by
the
comment
which
has
been
quoted
from
the
sherwood
case
in
1941.
and
i
think
it's
no
answer
from
my
adversary
to
say
that
he
was
unaware
of
what
this
court
said
in
these
several
cases
as
an
excuse
for
not
having
raised
that
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
public
policy
phase
of
this
question,
i
think,
is
also
relevant.
the
administrative
office
of
the
united
states
court
in
answer
to
an
inquiry
by
me
indicated
on
the
date
of
december
26,
1961
that
three
judges
of
the
court
of
claims
have
from
time
to
time
been
assigned
by
the
chief
justice
to
sit
in
the
various
courts
of
appeal
both
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
the
second
circuit.
the
only
statistics
available
as
to
the
number
of
cases
which
they
heard
and
participated
in
decision
apply
only
for
the
year
1961
at
which
time
the
record
indicates
that
judge
madden
in
a
period
of
one
week.
we
can
question
where
this
particular
case
was
argued
during
that
one
week
where
which
statistics
are
available
participated
in
18
cases.
now,
if
we
follow
my
adversary's
position,
that
there
is
a
jurisdictional
defect
in
the
sitting
of
judge
madden
and
the
assignment
of
judge
madden
to
court
of
appeals
and
that
that
jurisdictional
defect
can
be
raised
at
any
time
five
months
and
13
days
later
as
it
was
in
this
case
for
five
years
later.
then
of
course,
the
decisions
in
all
of
these
cases
would
be
of
no
effect.
and
the
questions
could
be
raised
by
a
motion
to
vacate
the
judgments.
mr.
morris
shapiro
well,
i
don't
know
but
that
may
have
occurred
in
other
cases,
too.
there
--
there
are
no
statistics
available
to
us
although
we've
made
inquiry
which
might
not
indicate
that
that's
situation
might
prevail.
but,
i
think
it's
mere
coincidence
that
you
have
this
situation
of
one
judge
dissenting
with
judge
madden
being
part
of
the
majority.
i
think
that's
pure
coincidence
because
if
the
question
should
have
been
raised
then
as
a
matter
of
a
public
policy
that
i
believe
disposes
of
the
question.
mr.
morris
shapiro
yes,
i
have
those.
mr.
morris
shapiro
yes.
mr.
morris
shapiro
judge
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
no,
they
are
not.
this
information
came
to
us
later.
and
we
would
be
pleased
to
submit
it
in
the
supplemental
brief
would
you
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
we
--
we
only
know
the
period
of
time
that
they
sat
tabulated
by
years.
we
don't
know
the
number
of
cases.
may
i
just
indicate,
your
honor,
what
that
situation
is?
mr.
morris
shapiro
at
1958.
and
judge
madden
has
sat
regularly
each
year
since
1958.
in
1958,
he
sat
for
a
period
in
february
and
again
in
june
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
commencing
in
1959,
judge
madden
has
sat
regularly
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
for
a
period
of
one
week
each
year,
1959,
1960,
1961.
in
addition
to
that,
judge
laramore
and
judge
whittaker
of
the
court
of
claims
have
sat
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
only
in
the
year
1958
and
not
since.
in
other
words,
just
to
summarize,
judge
madden
has
been
the
only
judge
who
has
sat
for
any
longer
period
of
time
beyond
the
year
1958.
and
of
course,
in
the
lurk
case,
we
have
the
situation
of
judge
jackson
and
so
far
as
judge
jackson
is
concerned,
he
sat
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
court
of
columbia
for
the
period
of
10
days
in
1958.
mr.
morris
shapiro
yes.
and
i
think
if
your
honors
will
examine
the
three
cases
which
have
been
cited
by
the
petitioner
on
this
appeal,
the
american-foreign
steamship
case,
the
ayrshire
collierie
case
and
frad
against
kelly.
in
all
three
cases
where
there
was
a
claim
of
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
court
in
all
three
cases
it
appeared
beyond
contradiction
that
the
protest
was
made
at
once
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
when
the
protest
was
made
apparent
or
the
basis
for
the
protest
was
made
apparent.
and
in
--
in
my
view,
i
think
the
reverse
of
that
situation
would
be
true
that
absent
such
a
protest
when
the
defect
becomes
apparent,
the
question
cannot
be
raised
at
a
later
date.
of
course,
in
our
case,
we
take
a
position
that
in
the
absence
of
a
protest
by
the
petitioner
in
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
ma
--
madden
had
all
of
the
characteristics
of
a
de
facto
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
morris
shapiro
well,
i
think
you
have
to
go
one
step
further.
in
other
words,
the
man
who
was
appointed
to
sit
in
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
a
judge.
he
must
have
been
performing
judicial
duties.
in
other
words,
i
think
to
take
the
question
posed
by
--one
raised
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
you
couldn't
take
a
commissioner
from
the
security
and
exchange
commission
or
a
retired
commissioner
from
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
permit
him
to
sit
on
the
court
of
appeals.
you
have
to
have
a
judge
who
has
been
performing
judicial
duties
and
who
has
engaged
in
judicial
business
and
who
has
come
from
a
court
and
authorized
him
to
sit
and
there
must
have
been
some
regularity
or
attempted
regularity
of
his
designation.
mr.
morris
shapiro
a
court
of
military
appeals
is
--
is
composed
of
judges
who
do
not
have
life
tenure.
mr.
morris
shapiro
well,
i
should
suppose
that
if
you
have
a
court
of
military
appeals
that
had
all
of
the
premise
that
exist
with
respect
to
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
and
if
they
were
performing
judicial
business
if
they
had
life
tenure
and
so
on,
all
of
these
things
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
if
the--
mr.
morris
shapiro
if
--
if
they
were
performing
judicial
business
which
could
be
placed
within
the
scope
of
article
iii
--
article
iii,
i
must
emphasize
that
as
a
necessary
element
in
this
situation.
mr.
morris
shapiro
a
commission
may
perform
such
functions.
but
it
doesn't
follow
that
just
because
a
commission
may
perform
such
functions
that
a
commissioner
may
be
assigned
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
other
words,
you
have
to
have
that
total
picture.
and
you
can't
segregate
and
carve
out
some
of
the
elements
and
say,
"well,
could
this
man
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
sit."
obviously,
not.
but
in
this
case,
we
had
all
of
the
elements
that
went
into
the
making
of
judge
madden
as
at
least
a
de
facto
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
morris
shapiro
one
important
element
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
well,
i
don't
want
to
stray
too
far
on
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
i
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
i
would
--
i
would
say
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
i
would
say
that
if
they
were
handling
cases,
determining
cases
which
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
in
the
language
of
article
iii,
if
they
were
given
life
tenure,
irreducibility
of
compensation
and
if
their
judgments
became
final
and
they
had
the
authority
to
render
final
judgments
and
if
they
were
constituted
as
a
court
engaged
in
the
performance
of
judicial
duties
and
they
had
all
of
that
trappings
of
a
court,
they
are
a
court
vested
with
judicial
power.
mr.
morris
shapiro
and
it
isn't
an
answer
to
say,
"well,
its
specialized
jurisdiction."
mr.
morris
shapiro
of
course
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
well
i
--
i
take
the
position
that
although
we
--
we
--
one
say
that
this
was
necessary
to
reach
that
point.
in
our
case,
that
congress
can
do
this
and
if
we
meet
all
of
the
elements
that
are
essential
to
the
creation
of
an
article
iii
court
that
is
to
say,
the
creation
of
a
court
within
the
scope
of
the
language
of
section
2
of
article
iii
vested
with
that
kind
of
jurisdiction
with
the
power
to
render
final
judgment.
the
mere
circumstance
that
the
court
is
exercising
jurisdiction
between
litigant
a
and
litigant
united
states
government
is
not
in
court
here.
mr.
morris
shapiro
if
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
may
i,
in
this
context,
read
to
your
honors
what
president
lincoln
said
in
1861
when
the
issue
was
of
considerable
and
critical
importance
to
give
to
the
court
of
claims
as
it
had
recently
been
constituted
the
power
to
render
final
judgments
as
--
as
one
of
the
elements
of
the
judicial
power.
and
i
think
it's
important
as
denoting
the
statutory
intent
when
congress
acted
as
it
did
in
1863
and
ultimately
in
1866.
mr.
morris
shapiro
i
--
i
should
be
delighted
to
do
that.
here,
up
to
1855,
as
the
court
knows,
all
claims
against
the
united
states
government
--
government
were
presented
to
the
congress.
in
1855,
the
question
arose
as
to
the
manner
in
which
congress
could
divest
itself
of
the
burden
of
passing
upon
these
claims.
and
so
they
decided
after
the
consideration
of
whether
a
commission
should
be
appointed
or
commissioners
delegated
to
the
task,
they
decided
to
create
a
court,
and
that
court
was
the
court
of
claims.
and
it
was
delegated
with
the
job
--
vested
with
the
job
of
hearing
and
determining
claims
against
the
united
states
government.
but
congress
at
once
modified
this
power
to
hear
and
determine
by
saying
that
the
report
on
these
claims
as
they
were
determined
were
to
be
referred
back
to
congress
which
in
effect
gave
to
congress
the
right
to
reverse,
to
ignore
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
in
--
in
--
in
1861,
at
the
outset
of
the
civil
war
and
with
the
enormous
rise
in
claims
against
the
united
states
government,
the
issue
arose
of
having
a
speedier
and
a
final
determination
of
these
claims.
and
the
message
of
president
lincoln
was
indicative
of
the
desire
of
the
president
and
the
later
action
of
congress
confirmed
that,
that
the
intent
was
to
vest
them
with
judicial
power.
and
if
i
may
be
permitted,
i
should
like
to
quote
from
president
lincoln's
message.
"it
is
as
much
the
duty
of
government
to
render
prompt
justice
against
itself
in
favor
of
citizens
as
it
is
to
administer
the
same
between
private
individuals.
the
investigation
and
adjudication
of
claims
in
their
nature
belonged
to
the
judicial
department.
it
was
intended
by
the
organization
of
the
court
of
claims,
mainly
to
remove
this
branch
of
business
from
the
halls
of
congress."
now,
congress
acted
once
again
in
the
light
of
this
message.
and
this
court,
after
congress
acted
in
the
gordon
case,
held
that
the
act
of
congress
did
not
represent
a
final
judgment
in
the
legal
sense
because
there
was
a
necessity
of
the
court
of
claims
reporting
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
for
the
purpose
of
appropriation.
and
congress
once
again
acted
in
1866
by
removing
this
offensive
clause
that
was
referred
to
in
the
gordon
case.
and
so
from
1866
until
1929,
for
all
purposes,
the
court
of
claims
had
all
of
the
characteristics
of
a
court
vested
with
those
powers
which
in
the
total
sum
represent
the
judicial
power.
and
there
was
never
any
question
raised
about
it
until
bakelite
and
williams.
now,
when
this
court
held
as
it
did
in
bakelite
and
williams,
congress
once
again
acted
in
1953.
and
congress
declared
that
the
court
of
claims
was
an
article
iii
court.
now,
at
the
very
least
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
at
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
what,
sir?
mr.
morris
shapiro
in
my
view,
it
does.
but
i
say
at
the
very
least.
that
act
of
congress
in
1953
is
entitled
to
great
respect
as
indicating
what
congress
has
decided
was
its
own
intent
as
a
body
acting
at
some
prior
time.
mr.
morris
shapiro
yes.
i
agree
to
that.
and
the
court
of
claims
is
such
a
court.
mr.
morris
shapiro
well,
i
--
i
should
suppose
that
congress
could
do
that.
but
the
point
of
the
--
of
the
argument
is
this,
that
having
created
the
court
of
claims
and
having
provided
for
life
tenure.
so
far
as
the
judges
of
that
court
are
concerned
and
having
granted
to
them
what
we
termed
the
judicial
power
that
is
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
well,
how
else
could
this
be
done?
the
power
to
--
the
power
to
create
inferior
courts
has
been
vested
in
the
congress.
the
only
court
mentioned
in
article
iii
is
this
court,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
refer
to
inferior
courts.
and
inferior
courts
such
will
have
the
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
what's
sir?
mr.
morris
shapiro
they
shall
have
life
tenure.
but
the
power
to
create
inferior
courts
is
vested
in
the
congress,
every
inferior
court
derives
its
authority
and
its
powers
at
its
source
of
appointment
from
legislation
enacted
by
congress.
and
that
applies
to
the
district
courts,
the
courts
of
appeal,
the
court
of
claims,
the
court
of
custom
and
patent
appeals
and
many
other
courts
of
a
wide
variety.
mr.
morris
shapiro
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
morris
shapiro
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
morris
shapiro
i
would
say
that
if
they
seek
to
this
in
a
court,
judicial
power
as
we
understand
it
from
article
iii
section
2,
then
all
the
other
things
must
follow
and
that
is
to
say
that
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
such
as
life
tenure,
that
irreducibility
of
compensation
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
yes.
mr.
morris
shapiro
yes.
mr.
morris
shapiro
well,
it
would
include
those
types
of
cases
which
are
within
the
scope
of
article
iii
that
is
to
say,
those
cases
in
whi
--
lower
equity
arising
out
of
the
constitution,
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
treaties
made
and
so
on.
if
they
don't
arise
in
that
fashion,
of
course,
congress
could
do
otherwise.
and
that
was
always
the
attitude
of
this
court
for
a
period
of
101
years
from
canter
until
bakelite
from
1828
until
1929.
there
was
no
deviation
at
all
in
the
attitude
of
that
court.
and
in
the
canter
case,
we
had
a
very
specialized
situation
thereof
necessity
the
--
the
life
of
the
court
which
was
adjudicating
controversies
in
the
territory
of
florida
was
temporary.
the
tenure
of
the
judges
was
temporary.
and
--
and
this
court
in
1828
carved
out
for
the
first
time
this
concept
of
a
legislative
court
which
would
apply
and
which
they
did
apply
to
courts
in
territories
and
to
counsel
of
courts.
but
for
101
years,
that
principle
was
not
extended
until
the
issue
came
up
in
bakelite
and
in
williams.
and
i
say,
that
if
you
have
the
bakelite
and
williams
case
on
the
one
hand,
dealing
as
they
said
with
what
they
refer
to
as
the
intent
of
the
congress
as
to
the
power
of
the
court.
and
on
the
other
hand,
a
manifestation
of
the
intent
of
the
congress
as
exemplified,
characterized
by
the
1953
act,
then
i
say
that
bakelite
and
williams
must
yield
to
the
1953
act.
mr.
morris
shapiro
not
at
all.
the
contrary
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
the
contrary
because
the
1953
act
came
after
bakelite
against
williams
and
this
court
could
in
all
--
mr.
morris
shapiro
in
the
bakelite
--
in
the
williams
case,
this
court
held
the
basis
of
the
court's
reasoning
was
that
the
fact
that
the
united
states
was
a
party
defendant
did
not
make
the
cases
of
--
as
--
of
cases
considered
by
the
court
of
claims,
cases
which
involved
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
in
the
williams
opinion
and
in
the
bakelite
opinion,
the
court
never
touched
upon
the
question
of
the
judicial
power
as
it
extended
to
all
cases
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
considered
it
or
not.
but
clearly
here
was
a
broader,
a
broader
scope
for
the
grant
of
judicial
power.
and
i
say
that
the
court
of
claims
is
dealing
constantly
with
cases
which
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
it
does
all
of
the
other
things
that
any
other
court
could
do
with
the
jurisdiction
that
it
exercise
are
under
appropriate
legislation.
and
the
mere
circumstance
that
it's
an
act
of
congress
doesn't
differentiate
the
court
of
claims
from
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
and
while
i
--
i
want
to
emphasize
once
again
that
williams
and
bakelite
need
not
be
overruled.
i
--
i
want
to
say
that
they
need
not
be
overruled
for
several
reasons.
this
court
could
hold
that
there
was
a
waiver
of
this
question.
this
court
could
hold
that
at
the
very
least,
judge
madden
exercised
de
facto
authority.
and
this
court
could
hold
that
the
1953
act
was
an
expression
by
congress
that
this
court
was
vested
beyond
all
prevention
of
doubt
with
judicial
power.
and
in
our
view,
congress
is
the
source
of
such
a
declaration
in
all
cases.
mr.
morris
shapiro
i
just
want
to
make
one
final
comment,
and
i
think
these
deals
with
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
court
of
claims'
determinations
are
not
subjected
to
the
will
of
congress.
the
characteristic
of
a
court
is
to
adjudicate
a
controversy
between
litigant
a
and
litigant
b
whether
they'd
be
private
litigants
or
the
government.
once
that
court
has
made
a
final
determination,
it
has
acted
in
terms
of
an
expression
of
judicial
power.
the
fact
that
congress
could
sit
back
and
say
try
to
enforce
that
judgment
is
of
no
relevance
whatever
in
terms
of
a
consideration
of
judicial
power.
the
fact
is
that
when
the
court
of
claims
act,
it
renders
a
judgment
which
is
final
for
all
purpose.
and
it
is
a
judgment
which
congress
cannot
reverse
by
any
act
of
congress.
that
it
cannot
do.
a
judgment
may
be
ineffective,
but
the
judgment
itself
is
not
at
the
whim
of
congress.
and
for
those
reasons,
we
say
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
