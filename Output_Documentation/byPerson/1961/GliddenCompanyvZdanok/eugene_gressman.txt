mr.
eugene
gressman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
this
case
comes
back
here
once
again,
it
is
confined
to
the
constitutional
issue
to
wit
--
whether
article
iii
of
the
constitution
authorizes
or
permits
the
assignment
of
a
retired
judge
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
to
sit
on
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
and
thereby,
to
preside
over
and
render
judgment
against
a
petitioner
on
trial
for
a
felony
as
defined
in
the
district
of
columbia
code.
well,
facts
in
this
case
are
quite
simple
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
it
only
makes
in
the
sense
that
felony
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
now
the
--
as
i
stated,
the
facts
are
simple
and
without
contest.
this
petitioner,
benny
lurk,
was
indicted,
tried
before
a
jury
and
convicted
of
the
crime
of
robbery
as
defined
in
the
district
of
columbia
code.
he
was
--
his
trial
was
presided
over
and
judgment
was
rendered
against
him
by
judge
joseph
r.
jackson.
trial
took
place
on
march
22,
1960.
now,
judge
jackson
had
then
appointed
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
in
1937.
he
sat
on
that
court
for
more
that
14
years
and
retired
there
from
in
1952.
several
years
thereafter,
began
a
series
of
assignments
of
judge
jackson
pursuant
to
section
294
(d)
of
title
28
of
the
u.s.
code
which
expressly
permits
and
authorizes
the
assignment
by
the
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
of
judges,
retired
judges
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
to
sit
on
district
courts
around
the
country.
the
particular
assignment
in
question
here
and
the
one
which
covered
the
period
during
which
petitioner's
trial
took
place,
delegated
or
authorized
judge
jackson
to
sit
on
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
for
the
entire
year
of
1960.
and
in
that
connection,
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
assignment
made
of
judge
jackson
for
the
year
1960
did
not
designate
him
to
sit
as
one
of
the
--
or
in
place
of
any
of
the
regular
15
judges
composing
the
district
court
of
the
united
states,
simply
authorized
him
to
fill
an
office
so-called
of
the
judge
of
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia,
an
office
which
was
created
solely
by
virtue
of
the
assignment,
made
pursuant
to
section
294
(d).
and
the
petitioner's
challenge
in
this
case
goes
to
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
which
purports
to
authorize
this
office
of
district
judge
of
the
united
states
by
virtue
of
an
assignment
of
a
retired
judge
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
we,
therefore,
attacking
the
de
jure
as
well
the
de
facto
in
nature
of
this
judge's
participation
as
a
judge
of
the
district
court.
and
under
these
circumstances
as
we
developed
more
fully
and
i
reply
brief
in
this
case,
the
first
defense
offered
by
the
government
in
this
case
in
terms
of
de
facto
doctrine
is
no
answer
to
the
challenge,
the
constitutional
challenge
made
by
petitioner
in
this
case
that
no
office
could
exist
by
virtue
of
an
assignment
under
this
statute.
now,
before
i
get
to
the
heart
of
the
constitutional
issue,
there
are
several
preliminary
considerations
which
i
would
like
to
submit,
which
i
feel
are
critical
to
an
understanding
of
that
constitutional
issue
and
which
form
the
context
within
which
this
issue
must
be
viewed.
now,
first
such
consideration
is
the
fact
that
this
petitioner
is
here
alleging
a
personal
constitutional
right
as
an
inhabitant
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
have
his
trial
in
the
district
court,
heard
by
a
judge
authorized
to
execute
article
iii
judicial
power
and
author
--
and
having
the
constitutional
immunity
or
independence
of
action
which
article
iii
gives
to
judges
of
article
iii
courts.
and
that
to
deny
him
that
claim,
that
right,
we
suggest,
is
to
deny
this
petitioner
due
process
of
law
in
his
trial
and
conviction.
now,
this
personal
claim
of
the
petitioner,
this
personal
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
think
it
--
it
automatically
follows.
the
claim
is
your
honor
that
the
provisions
of
article
iii,
section
1
relating
to
the
independence
of
the
federal
judiciary
in
terms
of
salary
and
tenure
of
office
are
designed
primarily,
i
suggest,
for
the
protection
of
the
litigants
and
the
defendants
who
are
called
before
article
iii
courts
and
they
are
not
as
this
court
said
in
evans
against
gore
and
reiterated
in
the
o'donoghue
case.
they
are
not
a
private
grant
to
the
judges
themselves.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it
was
put
in
there
primarily
to
--
as
the
evans
against
gore
points
out
that
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
guarantees
and
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
are
properly
administered
and
applied
by
the
judges
of
article
iii
courts,
that
it
was
absolutely
essential
that
the
judges
be
given
constitutional
independence
of
action
and
they
could
only
do
that
by
giving
them
life
tenure
and
by
protecting
them
from
any
diminution
in
their
compensation.
now,
i
think
necessarily
follows
from
that
that
the
litigants
and
the
defendants
are
entitled
to
that
constitutional
independence
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
sitting
in
judgment
of
them.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it
--
it
is
one
way
of
expressing
it
but
i
think
if
there
is
no
valid
article
iii
court
here
or
no
valid
article
iii
judge,
that
puts
an
end
to
it.
but
i
think
that
one
way
of
saying
that
from
another
angle
is
simply
that
there's
been
no
due
process
accorded
him.
but
i
don't
want
to
pursue
that
situation
because
i
think
as
you
say,
the
--
the
complete
answer
is
if
i
am
right,
law
in
the
fact
that
this
judge
was
not
authorized
under
the
constitution
to
sit
in
this
case
or
to
render
judgment.
in
that
respect,
i
submit
further
that
it
is
no
answer
as
the
government
seems
to
suggest
that
judge
jackson
has
life
tenure
by
virtue
of
a
congressional
enactment
in
1930.
whatever
statutory
protections
of
tenure
or
salary
that
judge
jackson
may
have
is
no
substitute
for
the
constitutional
requirements,
the
constitutional
protection
which
can
only
be
given
to
an
article
iii
judge
and
simply
because
congress
is
seen
fit
to
give
life
tenure
to
a
so-called
non-article
iii
judge
does
not
thereby
satisfy
the
constitutional
claim
which
i
am
here
asserting,
a
claim
which
requires
and
necessitates
that
the
life
tenure
and
the
protection
against
salary
compensation
diminutions
come
from
the
constitution
from
article
iii,
section
1
and
not
from
any
statutory
enactment.
and
i
might
say
that
as
i
will
develop
later,
that
congress
in
this
instance
has
demonstrated
an
ability
and
a
constitutional
right
to
cut
the
salaries
of
judges
such
as
judge
jackson
as
they
did
in
fact
in
1932.
but
moreover,
this
constitutional
claim
which
petitioner
is
here
asserting
is
one
which
very
definitely
can
be
raised
and
pursued
by
this
petitioner
as
an
inhabitant
of
the
district
of
columbia
because
the
o'donoghue
case
completely
answers
any
contrary
claim
by
demonstrating
and
ruling
that
district
of
columbia
inhabitants
are
not
less
fortified
by
the
guarantee
of
an
independent
judiciary
than
in
other
parts
of
the
union
and
that
they
too
like
the
inhabitants
of
all
the
other
50
states,
have
the
right
to
have
their
cases
arising
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
heard
and
determined,
i'm
quoting,
“by
federal
courts
created
under
and
vested
with
the
judicial
power
conferred
by
article
iii."
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
they
did
reach
the
constitutional
question.
i'll
be
glad
to
examine
into
that
at
this
point.
now,
their
answer
to
this
claim
which
i
am
asserting,
which
is
a
constitutional
claim
by
this
petitioner,
was
that
regardless
of
what
might
be
said
with
respect
to
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
the
complete
answer
is
to
be
found.
they
said
in
another
section
of
the
constitution
to
with
the
district
clause
of
article
i
which
is
in
section
8
clause
17
of
article
i.
so
they
said,
“we
will
avoid
any
determination
of
your
claim
under
article
iii
because
we
feel
that
the
complete
answer
is
to
be
found
under
the
district
of
columbia
clause.
now,
that
district
of
columbia
clause
merely
reads
that
the
congress
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
legislate
for
the
national
seat
of
government
or
the
district
of
columbia.
and
it
has
been
viewed
as
a
rather
plenary
congressional
power.
well,
be
that
as
it
may,
the
complete
answer
to
the
--
to
the
analysis
rendered
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
on
that
ground
again
is
to
be
found
in
the
o'donaghue
case
in
289
united
states,
which
demonstrates
that
that
district
of
columbia
clause
is
not
to
be
read
in
a
vacuum
and
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
application
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
moreover,
this
court
said
in
o'donaghue,
it
is
not
to
be
used
and
i
quote,
“to
destroy
the
operative
effect
of
the
judiciary
clause
namely
article
iii
within
the
district
of
columbia.”
now,
that
means
very
simply
this,
that
if
petitioner
is
right
in
asserting
that
article
iii
of
the
constitution
prohibits
this
assignment
and
requires
that
this
case
be
heard
and
determined
by
an
article
iii
judge,
then
it
is
no
answer
to
that
claim
that
the
district
of
columbia
clause
provides
any
type
of
an
answer
because
the
two
clauses
are
in
no
way
inconsistent
and
the
district
of
columbia
clause
is
not
to
be
used
to
prevent
the
operative
effect
of
article
iii.
in
other
words,
both
the
district
of
columbia
clause
and
article
iii
must
be
read
together,
both
of
them
must
be
applied
and
if
one
of
them
namely
article
iii
prohibits
this
assignment,
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
there
is
nothing
in
the
district
of
columbia
clause
which
would
override
or
make
inapplicable
the
provisions
of
article
iii.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
think
there
are
different
subsections
but
i
think
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
the
power
is
there
saying
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
your
honor.
it
is
a
unique
type
of
argument
that
has
been
advanced
and
has
been
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
assignment
to
this
particular
district
court.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
certainly,
it
could
not
be
sought
to
be
justified
in
terms
of
the
district
of
columbia
clause.
my
suggestion
or
argument
is,
however,
that
there
should
be
and
must
be
no
difference
that
the
o'donoghue
case
has
definitively
decided
that
there
is
no
difference
in
this
claim
or
this
right
as
between
district
inhabitants
and
inhabitants
of
new
york.
and
therefore
i
say,
we
get
back
to
the
original
proposition
and
it
is
as
if
--
in
effect
as
if
these
were
made
to
another
district
court
in
the
united
states.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
indeed
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
of
course
your
honor,
and
there
are
some
special
problems
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia
courts
which
do
not
exist
with
respect
to
the
federal
district
courts
and
any
other
parts
of
the
country.
but
in
this
respect,
with
respect
to
the
right
to
have
your
case
heard
and
determined
by
an
article
iii
court,
the
o'donoghue
case
has
definitively
said
that
there
is
no
difference
and
if
there
--
if
there
are
any
distinctions
to
be
made
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
exactly
right
and
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
and
i
suggest
and
i
have
raised
as
one
of
the
points
and
issue
in
this
case,
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
the
assumption
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
assignment
might
well
had
been
invalid
if
made
to
a
federal
district
court
outside
the
district,
but
they
said
it
would,
it
is
perfectly
permissible
by
virtue
of
the
district
of
columbia
clause.
i
suggest
that
it
is
an
issue
and
it
raises
serious
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
constitutional
questions
as
to
the
equality
in
the
administration
of
federal
justice
if
that
assumption
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
accepted.
and
it's
those
questions
of
equality
of
administration
of
the
justice
and
equality
in
the
rights
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
were
question
which
the
o'donoghue
case
sought
to
put
to
rest
and
i
suggest
did
put
to
rest
completely
and
therefore,
completely
form
an
answer
to
the
analysis,
to
the
assumption
and
to
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
the
o'donoghue
case
pointed
out
that
when
this
constitution
was
formulated,
there
was
no
district
of
columbia.
it
was
a
district
of
columbia
was
formulated
several
years
thereafter
from
the
states
of
maryland
and
dis
--
and
virginia.
and
that
the
inhabitants,
the
original
inhabitants
of
what
is
now
the
district
where
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
rest
of
the
united
states
and
that
this
equal
footing
in
effect
has
never
been
destroyed.
there
was
no
indication
in
the
forming
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
the
inhabitants
were
meant
thereby
to
be
stripped
of
the
rights
which
were
given
to
them
by
virtue
of
the
creation
and
adoption
of
the
constitution.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true
but
there
was
un
--
uncertain
where
that
would
be.
but
in
any
event,
no
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
there
is
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
in
this
respect,
i
have
that
the
o'donoghue
case
seems
to
me
unanswerable
in
terms
of
its
determination
that
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
a
right
or
to
have
cases
heard
by
article
iii
judges,
there
is
no
practical
or
let-alone
constitutional
reason
for
making
such
a
discrimination
against
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
of
columbia
because
you
have
an
article
iii
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
and
why
do
you
--
same
as
you
have
in
article
iii
courts
in
other
federal
districts
around
the
country.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
say
that,
i'm
not
saying
that
you
have
to
--
that
is
not
the
question
here
whether
you
have
to
have
one
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
fact
is
that
you
do
have
one
and
the
o'donaghue
case
so
ruled.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
certainly,
one
does
not
have
to
travel
beyond
the
scope
of
the
fact
that
this
involves
an
assignment
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
but
i
do
not
concede
that
there's
any
lack
of
a
constitutional
requirement
that
a
case
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
this
district
of
columbia
court
be
heard
other
than
by
a
non-article
iii
judge.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i'm
only
saying
your
honor
that
under
the
--
as
i
read
the
provisions
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
as
i
read
the
cases
in
this
court,
going
back
particularly
to
evans
against
gore
and
to
as
interpreted
and
applied
in
the
o'donoghue
case,
simply
is
that
this
is
a
universal
right
accorded
to
inhabitants
of
the
district
of
columbia
as
well
as
inhabitants
of
other
parts
of
the
country.
now,
true
enough?
mr.
eugene
gressman
we
are
confronted
seems
to
me
with
the
--
with
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
o'donoghue
case
that
this
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
constitutional
article
iii
courts.
now,
what
was
the
situation
before
that
is
somewhat
confused
but
at
least
since
the
o'donoghue
case,
there
has
been
no
question.
but
that
this
court,
the
district
of
columbia
is
basically
and
primarily
an
article
iii
court
and
its
judges
are
entitled
and
do
have
the
constitutional
protections
afforded
by
article
iii.
mr.
eugene
gressman
pardon?
mr.
eugene
gressman
the
trouble
is
your
honor,
that
judge
jackson
was
not
constitutionally
equipped
or
authorized
to
exercise
the
article
iii
functions
of
that
district
court
which
is
precisely
the
heart
of
the
constitutional
issue
which
i
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
would
like
to
develop
the
argument
in
some
length
in
answer
to
that
question
because
i
don't
think
there's
a
simple
short
answer
that
can
be
given
to
it.
it
really
involves
the
whole
essence
of
the
constitutional
claim
and
the
constitutional
issue
which
is
at
stake
here.
and
all
of
these
point,
i
merely
suggested
that
the
district
of
columbia
clause
and
the
fact
that
this
is
essentially
as
you
point
out,
the
district
of
columbia
problem,
does
not
provide
the
complete
or
the
--
any
part
of
the
answer
to
the
ultimate
constitutional
issue
which
must
be
faced
here.
mr.
eugene
gressman
the
district
court?
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
the
o'donoghue
case
said
that
the
district
court
of
the
--
federal
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
are
constitutional
courts.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
perfectly
right
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
what
the
o'donoghue
case
said.
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
they're
not
functions
which
are
called
into
play
in
this
case.
there
has
been
no
suggestion
made
by
the
government
in
this
case.
there
was
no
suggestion
made
in
the
o'donoghue
case
that
the
non-article
iii
functions
of
this
district
court
which
are
conferrable
upon
it
by
virtue
of
the
district
of
columbia
clause
ever
involved
criminal
proceedings.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
correct
your
honor,
the
way
the
williams
and
o'donoghue
cases
were
decided.
but
i
suggest
again
your
honor
that
the
basic
ruling
in
o'donoghue
was
that
while
certain
nonjudicial
functions
could
be
given
the
district
court
by
virtue
of
the
district
of
columbia
clause,
those
were
certainly
nonjudicial
actions
such
as
the
right
to
appoint
a
school
board,
the
right
to
give
certain
advisory
opinions,
the
right
to
perform
certain
administrative
matters
to
render
probate
and
divorce
proceedings.
but
nowhere
was
there
ever
any
suggestion
and
it
is
significant
the
solicitor
general
does
not
suggest
in
his
brief
that
one
of
those
nonjudicial
functions
is
the
trial
at
the
criminal
proceeding
such
as
we
have
in
this
case.
if
ever
there
was
a
proceeding
which
invoked
and
call
forth
and
necessitated
the
exercise
of
article
iii
functions
of
this
district
court,
it
was
this
trial
of
this
petitioner
for
the
--
a
felony
under
the
district
of
columbia
code.
and
i
suggest
that
it
is
impossible
from
any
standpoint
to
say
that
this
trial
of
this
petitioner
involved
anything
other
than
the
exercise
of
this
court's
article
iii
judicial
functions
as
defined
in
the
constitution.
the
criminal
power
is
the
very
essence
of
judicial
power.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
the
amicus
judges
in
this
case
have
suggested
that
kind
of
a
distinction
by
virtue
of
the
argument
that
this
type
of
jurisdiction
arise
in
over
criminal
crimes
specified
in
district
columbia
code
could
have
been
given
to
the
municipal
court
which
is
a
legislative
court.
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
it
--
it
did
not
and
i
don't
think
the
argument
is
sound.
mr.
eugene
gressman
if
this
were
a
legislative
proceeding
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
would
think
so.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
would
think
that's
exactly
right
your
honor
and
many
of
the
cases
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that
brings
us
then
again
to
the
very
heart
of
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case.
and
i
start
with
the
assumptions
and
the
decisions
rendered
by
this
court.
with
respect
to
the
two
tribunals
which
are
in
issue
here
and
which
must
be
compared,
the
bakelite
and
the
williams
cases
decided
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
was
a
legislative
or
article
i
tribunal
deriving
no
function
or
jurisdiction
in
its
creation
from
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
and
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
the
o'donoghue
case
saying
that
while
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
may
be
given
certain
non-article
iii
functions
which
are
not
in
issue
here.
it
is
primarily
an
article
iii
court
created
thereunder
and
endowed
with
all
the
powers
and
functions
which
are
given
to
a
--
to
a
court
by
article
iii
and
its
judges
are
endowed
with
the
judicial
independence
which
the
first
section
of
article
iii
gives
to
judges
of
article
iii
courts.
so
therefore,
we
have
posed
very
clearly,
the
basic
question
whether
the
judge
of
this
legislative
court
as
so
described
in
the
bakelite
and
williams
cases
can
be
assigned
over
to
a
constitutional
court
such
as
the
district
court
below
to
pursue
as
to
perform
the
article
iii
functions
necessitated
by
the
trial
of
a
criminal
case
therein.
now,
i
suggest
your
honors
that
this
necessitates
in
the
first
place
an
understanding
of
what
is
meant
by
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
as
expressed
in
article
iii
and
it
called
forth
to
be
exercised
in
this
proceeding
in
the
district
court.
and
i
suggest
your
honors
that
what
article
iii
judicial
power
basically
means
is
this.
that
it
is
that
function,
that
judicial
function
which
cannot
in
anyway
be
delegated
to
or
exercised
by
any
other
arm
of
the
government.
we
get
back
here
basically
to
a
question
of
separation
of
powers.
there
is
a
certain
core
of
judicial
action
and
jurisdiction
which
is
conferred
upon
the
article
iii
tribunals
and
this
district
court
in
particular
which
cannot
be
exercised
by
any
other
organ
of
the
government,
be
it
administrative,
be
it
legislative
or
executive.
now,
this
seems
to
me
to
call
forth
the
whole
host
of
considerations
that
we
normally
associate
with
the
courts
of
law
and
equity.
the
--
what
justice
frankfurter
has
described
in
several
occasions
as
jurisdiction
over
matters
such
as
where
the
traditional
concern
of
the
courts
at
westminster
prior
to
the
establishment
of
the
constitution.
this
calls
forth
the
exercise
of
that
judicial
power
over
cases
and
controversies
which
involved
the
use
of
the
federal
rules
or
civil
and
criminal
procedure
which
incorporate
all
the
provisions
of
the
jury
trial
system
and
which
involved
all
the
other
traditional
powers
of
equity
and
law,
the
substantive
and
procedural
elements
of
title
28
and
title
18
of
the
u.s.
code.
those
functions
which
by
the
very
nature
are
so
judicial
in
nature
that
they
cannot
be
given
by
congress
to
any
other
agency
of
the
government,
and
unless
a
court
has
that
non-delegable
power,
the
judicial
power,
which
it
alone
can
exercise,
then
it
is
not
a
court
created
under
or
exercising
article
iii
judicial
power.
and
i
suggest
that
the
most
outstanding
example
of
that
non-delegable
power
which
is
not
susceptible
of
exercise
by
any
other
organ
of
the
government
is
this
criminal
proceeding
instituted
against
this
petitioner.
it
is
inconceivable
that
this
petitioner
could
have
been
tried
and
convicted
by
an
administrative
agency,
by
an
executive
department
or
by
congress
itself.
this
was
something
that
was
not
susceptible
of
judicial
determination
other
than
by
an
article
iii
tribunal
with
all
the
traditional
inherent
powers
that
it
alone
can
exercise.
and
this
district
court
has
that
power
obviously
and
it
did
exercise
it
in
this
case,
and
it
therefore
necessitated
that
it
have
a
judge
qualified
constitutionally
to
administer
this
article
iii
judicial
power.
now,
i
want
to
hasten
to
add
an
important
qualification
on
this
or
an
additional
power
which
the
district
court
has
here
which
i
think
has
led
to
the
confusion
in
this
case,
that
article
iii
courts
also
have
power.
in
addition
to
this
core
of
non-delegable
judicial
power,
they
also
have
power
to
render
judgments
over
cases
and
controversies
which
are
equally
determinable
by
other
agencies
of
the
government.
now,
the
government's
brief
has
emphasized
and
the
all
parties
have
emphasized
very
significant
statement
made
over
a
hundred
years
ago
in
murray's
lessee
against
hoboken
land
company
where
mr.
justice
curtis
stated
a
very
obvious
and
important
consideration
about
the
jurisdiction
arising
other
than
from
article
iii.
and
i
quote,
he
said,
“that
there
are
matters
involving
public
rights
which
may
be
presented
in
such
form
that
the
judicial
power
is
capable
of
acting
on
them.”
that
means
article
iii
judicial
powers
are
capable
of
acting
on
them.
but
which
are
also
susceptible
of
judicial
determination
but
which
congress
may
or
may
not
bring
within
the
cognizance
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states
as
it
deems
proper.
now,
this
means
and
i
suggest
this
comes
from
the
very
heart
of
this
case.
this
means
that
there
are
functions
under
article
i
of
the
constitution
given
to
congress
and
in
the
execution
of
those
powers
are
called
forth
certain
judicial
determinations.
and
in
the
--
said
determining,
how
those
determinations
shall
be
made?
congress
has
a
choice.
it
may
withhold
to
itself
the
power
to
make
those
determinations
as
it
has
done
in
historically,
involving
claims
against
the
united
states,
the
power
to
pay
the
debts
of
the
united
states.
it
may
withhold
it
to
itself
through
private
legislation
or
it
may
give
it
to
an
executive
department
to
determine
or
an
administrative
agency
or
it
may
give
it
to
a
specialized
tribunal
such
as
the
court
of
claims
or
it
may
also
give
it
to
an
article
iii
court.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
there
is
a
contest.
mr.
eugene
gressman
your
honor
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
your
honor,
the
contest
does
get
all
not
quite
to
the
extent
which
you
just
stated
it,
but
it
does
get
to
this
point
and
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
this
extent.
the
argument
is
made
by
the
government
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
also
is
an
article
iii
tribunal
and
as
the
bakelite
and
williams
case
said
to
the
contrary,
they
should
be
overruled.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
that
therefore,
judge
jackson
having
been
a
judge
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
during,
some
--
and
--
and
being
appointed
to
that
court,
acquired
thereby
article
--
the
same
kind
of
article
iii
judicial
power
which
as
your
honor
points
out
is
being
administered
in
the
district
court
in
this
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
your
honor
what
i
--
all
i'm
trying
to
point
out
here
your
honor
is
the
nature
and
the
essential
correctness
of
this
court's
determination
in
bakelite
and
williams
that
this
was
an
article
i
or
a
non-article
iii
tribunal
which
never
acquired
any
function.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
--
(voice
overlap)
--
what
i'm
saying
is
this
that
the
very
elaborate
and
impressive
survey,
an
investigation
contained
in
the
government's
brief
demonstrates
conclusively
it
seems
to
me
the
correctness
of
this
court's
determination
in
bakelite
and
williams.
and
that
determination
is
grounded
upon
precisely
the
argument
i
am
trying
to
present
here
right
now
and
that
is
this,
that
a
court
to
be
created
under
article
iii
as
this
district
court
was
created,
must
have
necessity
be
created
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
these
non-delegable,
judicial
matters,
cases
and
controversies,
matters
which
cannot
as
this
criminal
case
could
not
be
exercised
by
any
other
organ
of
government.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
i'm
saying
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
as
demonstrated
conclusively
by
the
investigation
and
the
government's
brief
and
as
confirmed,
it
seems
to
me,
by
the
bakelite
and
williams
cases,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
never
had
that
kind
of
non-delegable
judicial
power.
all
they
have
ever
had
to
this
very
day
is
this
article
i
judicial
power.
this
judicial
power
which
is
delegable
as
congress
sees
fit
either
to
an
executive
department
as
they
once
did
in
--
in
the
customs
and
patent
matters
or
to
an
administrative
agency
or
to
a
specialized
court
or
to
an
article
iii
court
in
some
situations
or
congress
itself
could
do
it.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
your
honor,
let
--
let
me
--
let
me
make
this
comment
on
that.
i
agree
that
95%
with
what
you
just
said
but
what
the
specialized
federal
tribunal
of
which
you
were
just
speaking
lacks
in
its
creation
and
in
the
jurisdiction
conferred
upon
it
such
as
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
which
we
have
here
involved
is
a
--
one
i
ordered
of
the
judicial
power
which
is
non-exercisable
by
any
other
organ
of
government.
everything
that
this
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
ever
done,
is
in
the
--
as
a
matter
of
congressional
discretion,
exercisable
by
some
other
organ
of
government.
mr.
eugene
gressman
now
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
this
is
the
very
--
it
seems
to
me,
the
very
heart
of
the
government's
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
the
very
heart
of
the
government's
contention
is
that
the
bakelite
case
was
wrong
and
that
this
court
has
always
had.
this
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
always
had
article
iii
judicial
power
and
all
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
as
this
case?
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
the
government's
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
their
ultimate
position
your
honor.
they
asked
that
to
be
re-examined.
they
asked
that
its
premises
be
re-examined
and
that
it
be
directly
and
completely
overruled.
and
what
i'm
suggesting
your
honor
is
that
their
--
the
supporting
evidence
which
they
cite
for
that
proposition,
for
that
ultimate
position
is
--
does
not
justify
an
overruling
of
bakelite
that
the
bakelite
case
decision
was
completely
accurate
then
as
well
as
now
and
that
this
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
never
exercised
any
part
of
the
judicial
power
expressed
in
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
now,
your
honor
mentioned
the
commerce
court,
created
in
i
believe
1909
or
so.
and
that
very
definitely
was
a
constitutional
court
your
honor
but
for
a
very
special
reason,
and
i
think
it's
--
it's
a
good
example
of
what
is
the
difference
between
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
wasn't
more
than
that
your
honor.
the
courts
and
the
statute
reads
as
follows,
that
this
commerce
court
shall
be
composed
of
five
judges
to
be
designated
and
assigned
thereto
by
the
chief
justice
from
among
the
circuit
judges
of
the
united
states.
that's
the
first
clause
of
the
enact
--
enabling
legislation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
then
in
the
first
instance,
the
court
shall
be
composed
of
five
additional
circuit
judges
to
serve
for
one,
two,
three,
four
and
five-year
terms
respectively.
thereafter,
they
could
not
be
reappointed
to
the
commerce
court,
but
other
circuit
judges
from
around
the
country
were
deemed
to
be
brought
in.
and
the
original
five
judges
including
judge
mack
were
to
then
to
be
assigned
around
by
the
chief
justice
to
other
circuit
and
district
courts
and
around
the
country.
and
they
went
ahead
and
did
more
than
that.
they
expressly
gave
in
that
legislation
the
power
on
these
original
five
judges
including
judge
mack,
all
the
powers
possessed
by
the
district
judges
of
the
united
states.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
think
you'd
have
enough
an
up
for
--
another
reason,
you
might
not
have
--
they
would
not
be
article
iii
courts
for
that
--
article
iii
judges.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
one
of
the
decisive
things.
it's
also
a
decisive
what
kind
of
jurisdiction,
what
kind
of
powers
they're
invested
with.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
they
too
were
dealing
only
with
the
administration
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
eugene
gressman
true
enough,
but
i
do
not
view
the
--
those
matters
as
of
the
inherent
non-jud
--
or
the
inherent
judicial
nature
which
could
not
have
been
--
if
congress
had
so
conceived,
exercisable
by
some
tribunal
whose
judges
were
not
given
life
tenure
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
or
by
the
administrative
or
executive
agency.
and
therefore,
the
reason
why
that
was
a
commerce
--
that
commerce
court
was
a
constitutional
court
was
in
effect
because
these
functions
were
super
imposed
upon
the
federal
judiciary
and
these
judges
were
--
these
new
circuit
judges
were
given
not
only
the
function
of
the
power
to
deal
with
the
interstate
commerce
matters
come
in
before
the
commerce
court.
they
were
also
expressly
given
this
function
and
the
duty
of
performing
all
the
other
functions,
including
the
article
iii
functions
of
the
other
circuit
and
district
courts
to
which
they
were
to
be
assigned.
now,
that
has
never
of
course
been
done
with
respect
to
the
judges
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
or
with
respect
to
the
judges
of
the
court
of
claims.
and
i
suggest
that
we
get
back
to
the
basic
proposition
that
the
vital
distinction
between
the
specialized
federal
courts
such
as
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
the
article
iii
tribunal
is
the
possession
by
the
article
iii
courts
of
this
exclusively
judicial
power
which
cannot
be
exercised
by
any
tribunal.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
precisely
true,
your
honor.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
addition
to
this
exclusively
judicial
function
of
the
article
iii
courts,
they
also
have
this
function
of
deciding
cases
and
controversies
stemming
from
article
i
of
the
constitution
which
congress
may
delegate
either
to
article
iii
courts
to
its
specialized
tribunals,
to
administrative
agencies
or
to
itself.
now
that,
it
seems
to
me,
has
what
is
created
in
the
confusion
in
the
government's
mind
in
this
case
that
because
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
that
kind
of
jurisdiction,
which
on
occasion
has
been
or
could
be
exercised
by
article
iii
courts
as
well.
therefore,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
all
the
attributes
of
an
article
iii
court.
and
i
suggest
again
that
what
this
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
lacks
and
what
is
critical
to
its
lack
of
article
iii
status
is
the
absence
of
this
basic
judicial
power
which
cannot
be
delegated
to
anything
but
an
article
iii
court.
and
i
suggest
that
the
criminal
jurisdiction
and
perhaps
the
diversity
jurisdiction
of
the
kinds
of
things
mentioned
in
article
iii
and
there
are
probably
others.
we
don't
have
to
examine
into
them
all
that
cannot
be
given
by
congress
to
any
other
agency.
and
we
get
back
here
to
--
as
i
said
before
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
exactly
the
same
type
as
the
emergency
court
of
appeals.
mr.
eugene
gressman
those
were
--
that
was
a
court
--
a
so-called
court
superimposed
upon
the
federal
judiciary
on
judges
who
were
qualified
under
article
iii
to
exercise
a
particular
article
i
function.
but
in
this
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
precisely,
i
agree
with
everything
your
honor
has
said,
but
i
would
suggest
this
additional
comment
about
that.
that
the
admixture
of
jurisdiction
which
the
district
of
columbia
court
has
which
is
unlike
that
of
any
other
federal
district
court
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
whatever
nonjudicial
functions
were
--
may
constitutionally
be
given
to
that
court
were
not
called
into
play
in
this
case.
and
the
fact
moreover
that
that
court
does
have
certain
administrative
or
nonjudicial
functions,
does
not
justify
the
assignment
thereto
of
a
judge
from
a
nonjudicial
tribunal
or
a
non-article
iii
tribunal
in
order
to
exercise
the
district
court's
admitted
article
iii
power.
now
by
of
definition
as
you
--
as
i
think
your
honor
has
agreed,
this
criminal
proceeding
was
certainly
an
article
iii
function
of
this
court
and
in
order
to
perform
that
particular
function
to
render
a
judgment
against
this
petitioner
required
a
judge
i
suggest,
that
was
qualified
under
the
constitution
to
perform
that
article
iii
function.
and
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
this
district
court
has
certain
nonjudicial
functions
can
serve
as
a
crutch
to
permit
the
assignment
or
the
performance
of
this
article
iii
function
of
a
judge
who
by
his
service
on
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
never
required
article
iii
functions.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
you
mean
of
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
now,
your
--
your
honor
has
referred
to
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
to
this
so-called
transformation
of
1958
lies
precisely
in
the
analysis
which
i
have
been
presenting
your
honor.
and
that
is
that
if
i
am
correct
in
my
reading
of
the
constitution
and
the
cases
decided
thereunder
with
respect
to
these
courts.
if
it
is
true
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
never
had
any
heart
of
this
non-delegable
judicial
function,
if
it
only
had
the
article
i
powers
of
judicial
to
determine
certain
judicial
matters
which
are
exercaba
--
exercisable
by
any
agency
of
the
government,
the
congress
sees
fit.
then
i
suggest
that
without
create
and
changing
the
jurisdiction
or
the
nature
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
the
1958
declaration
of
congress
goes
for
naught
because
simply
by
saying
that
this
is
an
article
iii
court
when
in
fact
there
is
no
attempt
to
give
that
court
any
of
this
inherent
basic
judicial
function
which
is
not
exercisable
by
any
other
organ
of
government,
such
a
declaration
cannot
stand.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
as
i
understand
it,
there
--
there
are
two
basic
kinds,
the
customs
matters
and
the
patent
and
trademark
appeals
from
the
denial
of
a
patent
or
a
trademark
by
the
commissioner
of
patents.
mr.
eugene
gressman
certainly,
it
could
your
honor
and
in
fact,
you
have
an
alternative.
mr.
eugene
gressman
this
is
the
--
what
i
verb
--
well,
i
have
a
better
phrase
what
called
the
seductive
cliché
into
which
the
government
has
fallen,
it
seems
to
me,
because
what
i
have
been
trying
to
--
to
--
to
demonstrate
in
this
argument
is,
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
powers,
judicial
powers
exercisable
by
article
iii
courts.
one
is
the
exclusively
judicial
function,
and
the
second
is
this
alter
the
na
--
the
article
i
judicial
function
which
is
coordinate
in
many
instances
with
specialized
federal
tribunals
or
even
agencies
of
the
government.
the
government's
brief
points
out
correctly
that
there
are
certain
cases
under
the
clayton
act
that
can
be
brought
either
in
a
federal
district
court,
any
part
of
the
country
or
in
the
federal
trade
commission.
now,
i
suggest
that
--
it's
going
too
far
to
suggest
that
therefore,
the
federal
trade
commission
is
an
article
iii
court
because
it
is
exercising
the
same
kind
of
jurisdiction
as
the
district
court
in
that
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no.
mr.
eugene
gressman
because
your
honor
and
that
is
precisely
the
point
i've
been
trying
to
make.
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
they
have
not
given
them
--
they
cannot
--
in
establishing
an
article
iii
court,
you
cannot
give
to
it
solely
this
ambivalent
jurisdiction.
you've
got
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
precisely
your
honor
because
that's
exactly
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
what
the
--
the
hoboken
land
company
case
says.
and
what
--
what
this
court
said
--
for
example,
what
this
court
said
in
the
united
states
against
sherwood
in
312
u.s.
and
then
on
unanimous
opinion
by
judge
stone,
justice
--
mr.
justice
stone
saying
that
when
the
court
of
claims
has
identical
jurisdiction
with
the
district
court
under
the
tucker
act,
they
expressly
pointed
out
that
despite
that
concurrence
of
jurisdiction
and
i
quote
from
it,
“the
court
of
claims
remains
a
legislative,
not
a
constitutional
court.”
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
say
your
honor
that
unless
congress
gives
to
the
judicial
tribunal,
that
judicial
power
which
cannot
be
delegated
by
congress
to
any
other
agency
or
the
government,
then
you
do
not
create
an
article
iii
court,
and
you
violate
the
very
basic
concept
of
separation
of
powers
upon
which
this
whole
doctrine
rests.
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
seems
to
me
that's
precisely
what
bakelite
and
williams,
o'donoghue
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
your
honor
i
only
--
i
can
only
suggest
that
it
is
my
--
in
my
reading
of
the
constitution
and
in
reading
of
these
cases
that
gives
rise
to
this
consistent
thread,
this
demarcation
which
explains
what
the
court
did
basically
in
bakelite
and
williams
and
which
is
consistent
with
the
constitutional
interpretation
which
i
suggest
is
proper.
and
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
you
might
add
that
we
never
this
--
particular,
the
tribunals
are
now
constituted
never
reconsiders
prior
decision.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
suggest
not
under
the
constitution.
mr.
eugene
gressman
because
they
too,
like
every
other
administrative
agency
and
like
every
specialized
tribunal
as
we're
talking
about
today,
they
do
not
have
any
of
that
essential
judicial
power
which
can
--
by
definition
cannot
be
exercised
by
any
other
organ
of
the
government.
now,
there
are
very
--
it
seems,
there
are
only
a
few
examples
of
that
type
of
article
iii
court.
mr.
eugene
gressman
because
that
it
seems
to
me,
you
break
down
the
whole
distinction
between
the
judicial
and
the
legislative
branch
of
government.
if
every
organ
of
--
of
the
legislature
or
of
the
executive
which
makes
some
kind
of
judicial
determination
in
matters
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
is
susceptible
of
being
declared
an
article
iii
tribunal,
subject
to
all
the
powers
and
the
limitations
and
the
protections
that
are
accorded
therewith,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
have
destroyed
the
very
basic
distinction
between
the
article
iii
and
article
i
and
the
separation
of
powers
contained
therein.
now,
there
has
to
be
a
practical
accommodations,
of
course,
in
the
execution
of
the
powers
of
congress
and
in
the
exercising
those
powers,
congress
must
be
given
the
freedom
to
choose
where
it
want
certain
types
of
judicial
determinations
made
either
in
the
executive
or
the
legislative
or
in
the
judicial
branches
of
the
government.
but
there
are
certain
things
called
into
play
of
a
judicial
nature,
which
when
so-called
into
play,
such
as
a
criminal
sanction
cannot
be
exercised
at
the
discretion
of
congress
but
any
organ
of
government
other
than
a
court
created
under
the
constitution
article
iii
and
composed
of
judges
who
are
constitutionally
independent
and
constitutionally
authorize
to
exercise
that.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
he
was
given
life
tenure
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
statute,
enacted
1930
before
his
appointment,
so
he
came
on
there
certainly
in
statutory
contemplation
with
life
tenure.
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
my
suggestion
is
that
by
virtue
of
the
nature
of
this
court,
he
did
not
have
constitutional
life
tenure
and
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
permitting
congress
to
make
that
kind
of
a
declaration
and
making
it
constitutionally
effective
thereby
is
to
destroy
the
basic
separation
between
the
judicial
and
the
legislative
branches
of
the
government
moreover.
it
seems
also
clear
to
me
that
this
critical
non-delegable
judicial
function
as
expressed
here
particularly
in
a
criminal
proceeding
is
precisely
where
you
need
and
must
have
this
constitutional
independence
in
your
judges.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
the
man
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
under
this
--
under
that
suggestion
your
honor,
he
could
get
anybody
in
the
world
who
had
been
--
ever
been
appointed
to
this
particular
agency
because
he
would
thereby
and
forever
after
in
a
retired
status
or
otherwise
have
article
iii
status,
and
you
could
have
appointed
the
district
court
by
assignment.
everybody
who
has
ever
been
a
member
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
the
sec
or
any
other
agency
including
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
which
congress
has
ever
designated
by
fiat
as
a
court
created
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
they're
judicial
in
certain
--
in
a
certain
sense
that
if
they
were
framed
in
the
nature
of
a
case
or
controversy,
they
would
be
subject
of
course
to
--
and
are
subject
to
--
to
inquiry
and
resolution.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
it's
a
--
i
suppose
involves
a
suit
or
a
claim
by
an
individual
or
a
corporation
against
the
united
states
which
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
or
railroad
against
united
states
which
certainly
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
they
could
be,
but
i
don't
--
i
suggest
they're
not
article
iii
judicial
--
of
this
non-delegable
nature
because
obviously,
they
are
determined
in
many
instances
by
the
icc
in
the
first
instance.
they're
also
determined
by
--
could
be
determined
by
other
agencies
or
by
article
iii
court.
but
it
seems
to
me
also
important
to
recognize
that
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
precisely.
this
was
where
the
--
where
the
argument
runs
and
that
to
the
extent
the
congress
wants
to
make
such
a
declaration
as
it
did
1958.
as
to
this
court,
it
could
make
a
similar
declaration
as
to
every
other
administrative
agency
that
ever
determines
matters
which
are
in
a
judicial
form
of
say
a
case
or
controversy,
as
most
administrative
agencies
do
deal
with,
and
at
least
in
the
first
instance.
and
thereby,
you
have
appointed
or
delegated
or
assigned
to
the
district
court
and
then
whom
the
president
and
the
senate
never
considered
as
through
their
qualifications
to
render
a
judgment
in
a
--
and
--
and
--
a
trial
in
a
criminal
case
or
in
any
other
type
of
this
inherent
non-delegable
judicial
functions
performed
in
an
article
iii
court.
and
the
whole
system
breaks
down
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
the
investiture
of
that
judge
and
the
court
to
which
he
was
appointed
with
authority
to
exercise
the
basic
article
iii
function,
which
only
an
article
iii
court
can
exercise
and
that
includes
primarily
and
all
we
have
involved
here
is
criminal
trials.
mr.
eugene
gressman
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
correct.
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
wouldn't
be
an
article
iii
court,
your
honor.
there
--
there
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
precisely
your
honor,
i
think
chief
justice
vinson
in
his
opinion
in
the
tidewater
case
expressly
pointed
out
that
this
court
obviously
reviews
in
judgments,
in
cases
from
tribunals
which
are
not
article
iii
courts
with
federal
--
which
are
presented
in
such
a
form
of
a
case
or
controversy
which
permits
this
court
to
exercise
review
jurisdiction.
now,
this
doesn't
mean
that
simply
because
a
matter
is
formulated
in
the
--
in
the
posture
of
a
case
or
controversy
and
arises
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
that
therefore
necessarily,
it
is
exercising
our
article
iii
judicial
power.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
it's
not
tainted.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
it's
said
because
--
it
is
an
article
i
court
your
honor,
and
not
an
article
iii
court.
and
this
court
has
from
time
in
memorial
been
exercising
review
jurisdiction
from
both
article
i
courts
and
article
iii
courts.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
think
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
eugene
gressman
thank
you.
mr.
eugene
gressman
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
few
minutes
remaining
in
me,
i
like
to
briefly
discuss
several
points
mentioned
by
the
solicitor
general.
in
the
first
place,
and
then
align
with
the
discussion
that
just
taken
place,
i
challenge
the
right
of
congress
to
provide
that
a
crime
--
that
a
felony
can
be
tried
in
the
district
of
columbia
other
than
before
an
article
iii
court
or
an
article
iii
judge.
this
court
has
never
said
to
my
knowledge
that
a
person
charged
with
a
felony
in
the
district
of
columbia
may
be
tried
before
a
legislative
court
or
a
legislative
judge.
now,
i
think
there
are
serious
questions,
serious
constitutional
questions
raised
by
any
assumption
or
by
any
effort
by
congress
to
provide
that
the
person
accused
in
the
district
of
a
serious
felony
crime
is
not
entitled
to
the
constitutional
independence
of
a
judge
assigned
to
sit
in
judgment
of
that
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
that
brings
into
a
consideration
--
entirely
different
line
of
factors,
namely,
the
historical
difference
recognized
between
felonies
and
misdemeanors
and
the
historical
doctrine
which
has
always
been
recognized
that
in
misdemeanors
may
be
tried
before
petty
courts.
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true.
that
comes
under
the
district
clause
of
the
constitution
authority.
but
i
do
not
concede
that
when
a
felony
is
involved
that
that
district
clause
necessarily
gives
the
authority
to
congress
to
establish
that
the
crime
maybe
tried
before
the
municipal
court.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no.
the
constitution
article
iii
provides
that
you
may
have
cases
heard
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
and
this
court
has
held
consistently
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
a
crime
against
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
crime
against
the
united
states
and
that
the
district
code
is
a
law
of
the
united
states
under
--
within
the
meaning
of
a
constitutional
phrase.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that
comes
then
into
your
historical
and
always
a
recognized
exception
solely
in
terms
of
misdemeanors.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
at
least
as
far
as
congressional
legislation
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
that
was
necessarily
a
constitutionally
recognized
distinction
or
lack
of
distinction.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that
--
that
was
a
--
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
operation
of
the
district
and
it
was
soon
changed.
mr.
eugene
gressman
as
i
recognized
it
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that
may
well
be
true.
but
i
suggest
that
to
make
a
distinction
as
to
felony
crimes
as
between
those
accused
of
felonies
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
those
in
other
parts
of
the
country
called
before
federal
district
courts
is
to
create
again
a
most
serious
discrimination
because
your
honors
are
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
is
an
assimilative
crime
statute
which
provides
that
--
that
--
giving
jurisdiction
to
federal
district
courts
all
around
the
country
to
try
serious
felony
crimes
committed
on
felony
--
on
federal
property.
and
any
person
accused
and
tried
in
a
federal
district
court
in
kentucky
for
the
crime
of
burglary
or
robbery
or
murder
committed
at
fort
knox
is
certainly
entitled
to
a
trial
on
that
charge
before
an
article
iii
judge
and
an
article
iii
court.
and
i
sub
--
and
that
too,
the
power
to
provide
for
such
trials
comes
again
out
of
article
i
section
8
clause
17,
the
same
clause,
the
same
section
of
the
constitution
which
is
involved
in
this
case,
the
district
of
columbia
clause,
the
clause
that
gives
congress
the
power
to
legislate
and
provide
for
situations
arising
on
other
federal
property.
but
again,
this
problem
need
not
be
reached.
the
solicitor
general
is
so
anxious
to
avoid
to
--
to
a
constitutional
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
another
problem
that
can
be
avoided
because
the
plain
fact,
undeniable
fact
is
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
what
congress
might
have
done
with
respect
to
the
trial
of
felonies,
we
are
dealing
with
congress
--
what
congress
has
done
to
it.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
have
this
constitutional
challenge
that
the
petitioner
makes,
goes
to
--
to
the
validity
of
that
1922
statute
as
elaborated
in
1958
and
the
expansion
thereof
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
bakelite
case
gave
warning
in
1929
that
there
might
be
serious
constitutional
questions
about
such
assignments.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
he
said
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
he's
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
there
you
get
you
--
your
honor
into
the
other
elaborating
problem
in
the
bakelite,
which
as
you
are
well
aware,
referred
to
the
district
of
columbia
courts
as
legislative
courts
which
was
later
expressly
overruled
in
the
o'donoghue
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
so
that
you
--
we
have
this
--
this
is
not
a
matter
of
complete
consistency
in
--
in
rulings
and
determinations.
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
i
would
say
in
conclusion,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
consist
--
a
line
of
consistency
that
runs
through
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
which
constitutes,
it
seems
to
me,
the
key
to
this
entire
case.
and
i
think
its
best
expressed
at
page
579
of
the
williams
case
in
289
united
states
which
again
reiterates
that
precise
demarcation
which
i
have
tried
to
develop
in
this
case.
and
again,
justice
sutherland,
speaking
for
unanimous
court
in
that
case
goes
back
to
murray's
lessee
against
hoboken
land
and
improvement
company
and
points
out
by
quotation
that
there
are
certain
matters
which
once
invoked
by
congress
absolutely
require
judicial
determination
and
cannot
be
delegated
to
any
other
agency
of
the
government.
and
at
the
--
on
that
time
--
and
at
the
same
time,
there
are
matters
involving
public
rights
growing
out
of
article
i
which
congress
can
as
it
sees
fit,
give
either
to
an
administrative
and
executive
or
a
legislative
or
even
a
judicial
arm
of
the
government.
now,
if
it
does
only
the
latter
such
as
it
--
the
court
said
in
the
williams
case,
since
all
matters
were
made
cognizable
by
the
court
of
claims
are
equally
susceptible
for
--
of
legislative
or
executive
determination.
they
are
of
course
matters
in
respect
of
which
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
a
judicial
remedy.
and
the
court
thereby
does
not
become
one
created
or
authorized
to
exercise
article
iii
judicial
power.
now,
this
--
this
maybe
esoteric
considerations
but
at
the
same
time,
they
are
considerations
that
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine.
mr.
eugene
gressman
exactly,
but
they
had
one
other
thing,
your
honor,
and
this
i
think
was
critical
that
judges
that
were
selected
for
that
court
were
not
only
given
jurisdiction.
mr.
eugene
gressman
we
are
talking
about
judges
your
honor
in
this
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
am
saying
your
honor
that
the
judges
thereof
were
article
iii
court
judges
because
they
were
not
only
given
jurisdiction
and
power
to
execute
the
functions
of
the
commerce
course
--
court.
they
were
expressly
given
the
authority
by
statute
and
in
--
to
exercise
the
authority
of
the
regular
circuit
and
district
judges.
and
they
were
to
be
assigned
thereto
with
the
expressed
power
having
been
given
to.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
this
precise
situation
arose
with
the
emergency
court
of
appeals.
they
superimposed
upon
article
iii
judges
as
in
the
sense
--
as
exactly
what
they
did
in
the
commerce
court,
they
impo
--
superimposed
upon
judges
qualified
to
exercise
article
iii
powers
and
additional
function.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
think
it's
constitutional
for
the
sense
that
--
in
the
sense
that
the
judges
or
you
would
already
have
article
iii
judicial
power.
mr.
eugene
gressman
exactly.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
if
the
court
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
if
the
court
and
the
judges
thereof
are
established
for
the
sole
purpose,
the
sole
purpose
of
exercising
this
ambiguous
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
ambivalent
jurisdiction.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
say
it
is
not
an
article
iii
court.
but
if
they
want
to
give
this
ambivalent
jurisdiction
to
article
iii
courts
or
to
judges
who
are
already
qualified
under
article
iii,
that
is
perfectly
permissible.
that's
the
basic
distinction.
mr.
eugene
gressman
then
that's
another
line
--
that's
another
line
of
distinction.
if
you're
going
to
try
to
impose
on
an
article
iii
judge,
what
is
not
a
case
or
controversy
or
what
is
not
judicial
at
all
in
nature.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
only
in
the
same
sense
that
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
was
a
specialized
tribunal.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
your
honor
because
it
seems
to
me
those
are
the
only
two
exceptions
in
all
american
history
where
article
iii
judges
previously
qualified
to
exercise
article
iii
judicial
power
have
had
given
to
them
in
the
--
in
the
format
of
a
specialized
tribunal
superimposed
upon
them,
this
ambivalent
jurisdiction.
mr.
eugene
gressman
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
i
think
it
also
--
the
judges
at
the
same
time.
mr.
eugene
gressman
thank
you
(inaudible).
