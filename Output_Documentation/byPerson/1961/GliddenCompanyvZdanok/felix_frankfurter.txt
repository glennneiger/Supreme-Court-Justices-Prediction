suppose
you're
right
--
suppose
you
are
right
on
the
assumption
that
you're
right,
would
you
good
enough
to
response
to
justice
stewart's
question
namely
that
it
arose
under
law
of
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
did
arise
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
law
of
united
states
as
you
contend
it.
on
that
assumption,
what
is
the
answer
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
justice
stewart
put
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
bordeau,
i
think
your
line
of
argument
shows
how
a
stray
one
can
go,
from
my
point
of
view,
how
--
how
foggy
the
whole
business
is
which
we
tried
to
discuss
these
matters
nearly
as
a
matter
of
logic.
and
for
this
reason,
the
judicial
power
of
article
iii,
the
judicial
power
shall
extend
through
all
cases
arising
under
this
constitution,
the
laws
of
united
states.
now,
article
iii
says
the
judicial
power
should
extend
to
all
cases
arising
under
the
laws
of
united
states.
no
legislative
court
had
any
jurisdiction
except
under
cons
--
as
to
controversies
arising
under
the
laws
of
united
states.
this
one
was
merely
dealing
with
english
to
its
construction
of
language
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
would
have,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
a
--
how
could
a
legislative
court
come
in
--
come
in
to
being
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
legislative
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
not
dealing
with
this
congressional
distinction?
i'm
taking
your
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
judicial
power
shall
extend
to
all
cases
arising
under
this
constitution
the
laws
of
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
--
what
i'm
putting
to
you
is
this.
if
one
merely
deals
with
the
constitution
over
a
bunch
of
conglomeration
of
words,
how
wrong
we
can
go?
one
can
be
thinking
purely
and
logically
but
one
can
go
awfully
wrong
and
this
is
my
view.
because
if
that's
all
you
do,
then
every
legislative
court,
no
legislative
court
can
came
into
be.
no
legislative
court
has
any
authority
except
by
virtue
or
what
section
2
calls
arriving
under
this
constitution,
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
therefore,
the
whole
conception
which
runs
through
from
the
beginning
of
canter
since
american
insurance
company
against
canter.
the
very
distance
of
legislative
courts
apart
from
article
iii
courts
is
in
violation
of
the
mere
english
of
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
the
--
deal
with
this
question
that
i've
put
to
you
that
article
iii
cover
--
says
the
judicial
power
shall
extend
to
the
laws
of
--
to
all
cases
arising
under
the
constitution
and
laws.
and
if
article
iii
defines
the
tenure
of
the
judges,
article
iii,
i
think
--
i
think,
if
one
has
to
guess
on
the
materials
we've
got,
i
think
if
one
had
to
do
that
and
live
all
history
and
send
history
to
the
wind,
one
has
the
right
to
conclude
that
they
meant
article
iii
to
be
the
inclusive,
comprehensive
provision
for
establishing
courts
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
therefore
i
reached
the
logical
conclusion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
you
reach
the
opposite
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
this
isn't
only
a
case
where
a
page
of
history
is
worth
a
volume
of
logic.
it's
the
case
where
three
volumes
of
history
as
against
one
volume
of
logic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
if
it
sets
up
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
sets
up
anything
like
a
court,
meaning
adjudicatory
body
governed
by
the
procedures
that
are
familiar
to
us
composes
of
judges,
etcetera.
if
it
sets
up
a
court,
then
i
put
it
to
you
that
just
reading
the
constitution
as
an
--
an
informed
professor
of
the
english
literature
which
the
lord
knows
i'm
not,
i
should
think
its
clearly
required
that
it
come
--
that
it
come
within
from
article
iii
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that's
what
the
judicial
power
extends
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
case
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
that
that
comes
into
being
only
when
congress
chooses
not
to
have
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
or
the
president
make
those
decisions.
but
once
they
wanted
to
be
subjected
to
adjudication
and
therefore,
of
court
then,
as
a
matter
of
english,
as
a
matter
of
reading
the
constitution,
the
judicial
power
extends
to
that
you
can
have
only
one
type
of
court
which
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
against
the
history
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
take
that
for
granted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
have
to
recite
the
liberty
that
i
believe
in
the
bill
of
rights
everyday
in
order
to
believe
in
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
agree
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
agree
with
mr.
gressman
because
the
decisions
are
clear
that
there
are
matters
that
come
before
the
courts
of
the
united
states
everyday,
the
unquestioned
courts.
what
everybody
calls
article
iii
courts
that
come
in
question
before
those
courts
everyday
and
questions
come
before
this
court
which
could
have
been
taking
entirely
out
of
judicial
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
point
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
point
is
that
if
you
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
point
is
if
you
read
the
constitution
to
talk
about
article
i
court
is
to
talk
mumble
jumble
as
a
matter
of
logic.
i'm
not
talking
as
a
matter
of
history.
as
a
matter
of
history,
there
it
is
like
a
lot
of
other
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
article
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
bordeau,
we're
always
admonished
to
be
realistic.
now,
the
starting
point
of
this
whole
legislative
court
business
is
american
insurance
company
against
canter.
and
then
this
court
was
confronted
with
a
very
practical
problem
namely,
what
to
do
with
florida?
nobody
knowing
what
will
become
of
florida.
how
long
it
will
remain
a
territory?
when
it
will
be
called
into
a
state
and
should
this
court
reach
the
conclusion
that
article
iii
doesn't
limit
the
power
of
congress
in
order
to
deal
with
newly
acquired
territory
to
establish
courts
and
not
give
them
life
tenures.
that's
the
source
of
all
these
business.
in
short,
what
they
did,
though
they
didn't
say
it
in
words
and
to
say
the
necessary
improper
clause
of
article
i,
enables
congress
not
only
to
it
--
of
this
country,
not
only
to
acquire
a
new
territory
but
to
make
effective
its
government.
and
one
way
to
having
government
is
to
having
courts.
but
they
shrank
from
requiring
life
tenure
judges
in
the
new
terri
--
in
the
louisiana
purchase.
that's
the
history
of
this
business
and
unless
we
remember
that
all
of
this
is
a
metaphysical
obfuscation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
make
a
difference
whether
it's
felony
or
misdemeanor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
assuming
misdemeanor
is
triable
before
a
court
and
jury,
would
it
make
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you.
if
you're
right,
why
do
we
have
to
bother
about
due
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
life
tenure
was
put
in
the
constitution
on
due
process
consideration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
is
no
valid
court,
you
don't
have
to
bother
about
due
process,
do
you?
you
have
to
bring
everything
under
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gressman,
is
there
--
just
confirmed
an
impression
i
have
or
information
i
have
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
assigning
of
chief
justice
to
courts
throughout
the
country,
either
the
district
courts
or
court
of
appeals,
but
let's
stick
to
district
court
trial,
jury
trial,
is
the
assigning
statutory
authority
given
to
the
chief
justice
differentiate
between
judges
of
the
court
of
customs
appeal
and
judges
of
the
court
of
claims?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
mean
the
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
whatever
you
--
whatever
you
may
be
arguing
as
to
the
particular
authority
of
power
or
sanctions
derivable
from
the
district
of
columbia
clause
of
the
constitution;
the
purpose
of
the
sitting
in
the
district
of
columbia
wouldn't
carry
you,
that
wouldn't
take
care
of,
object
the
right
to
assign
at
another
district
outside
of
the
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
they
had
before
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
not
questioning
the
naturalness
of
the
propriety
or
the
correctness
for
chance
of
dealing
with
the
situation
that
had
before
them
indeed
i'm
flouted.
but
for
purposes
of
argument,
i
just
want
to
know
would
the
problem
be
--
you
couldn't
--
this
argument
couldn't
be
made
if
which
has
just
a
statue
has
been
assigned
to
a
trial
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
file
the
case
that
you're
charged
and
we
are
charged,
we
may
move
simply
within
the
narrow
confines
or
what
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
decided.
i'm
not
saying
with
its
conclusion
but
we
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
restrict
the
problem
to
its
narrow
confines.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
o'donoghue
case
itself
concerned
the
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
required
the
constitutional
amendment
to
secure
equality
for
the
people
in
the
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
an
anticipation
of
the
constitution
or
specific
anticipation
that
a
district
would
be
created
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
something
called
the
capital.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
one
would
have
to
swallow
a
lot,
swallow
everything
that
was
said
in
o'donoghue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
assuming
the
whole
question
in
the
implication
that
because
you
have
an
article
iii
court
therefore
you
have
to
have
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
do
have
one
but
you
don't
have
to
have
one
for
the
district
of
columbia.
if
justice
may
be
administered
by
judges
who
do
not
have
life
tenure
and
whose
salary
go
to
a
gross
aspect
of
the
administration
of
justice
and
on
salary
but
not
immunized
against
diminution.
if
you
may
have
that
and
that
has
been
constitutional
practice,
but
i
do
not
know
how
long
in
the
beginning
of
time,
then
my
question
arises,
why
do
we
have
to
travel
outside
the
purposes
of
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
namely
where
the
judge
was
assigned
merely
to
the
district.
in
this
case,
why
do
we
have
to
travel
outside
the
bounds
except
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
practically
of
course,
that's
all
decided.
it
takes
--
it
doesn't
take
care
of
contingencies.
if
the
chief
justice
confronted
with
an
application
for
sua
sponte
there's
a
need
to
judge
in
some
district,
we
naturally
would
pause
if
we
don't
--
if
this
isn't
decided
in
sending
a
court
of
custom
appeal
man
to
some
other
place
than
district,
if
that's
all
what
would
be
decided
in
this
case.
if
he
had
only
the
direction
of
the
court
of
appeals
just
as
a
practical
matter
as
you
suppose
you
thought.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
as
a
matter
of
the
adjudicatory
requirements
of
this
case,
do
we
have
to
travel
outside
as
justice
harlan
asked
you
a
little
while
ago
outside
of
the
scope
set
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
a
matter
--
i
also
appreciate
why
you
want
them
invoked,
why
you
press
due
process,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
how
can
you
say
that
when
both
--
i
don't
know
how
many,
almost
from
the
beginning
of
time,
trials
from
the
district
of
columbia
were
not
have
before
article
iii
judges.
meaning
by
that,
judges
who
had
life
tenure
with
a
non-diminishable
salary,
how
can
you
say
that
and
the
constitutional
practice
or
the
practice
has
been
ever
since
the
creation
of
this
district?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
are
article
iii
courts,
then
what's
the
vice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
are
article
iii
courts
then
what's
the
trouble?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
because
at
the
time
he
was
appointed,
he
wasn't
such?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
court
in
your
view
today
that
february
21st,
1962,
is
that
court
today
an
article
iii
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
the
court
of
customs
appeal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
not.
well,
i
thought
you
said
the
court
of
--
o'donoghue
case
said
it
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
haven't
you
got
trouble
with
that
if
it's
a
constitutional
court,
how
can
it
exercise
non-constitutional
functions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
it
can,
it
can
only
because
of
the
district
of
columbia
article?
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
of
them
admix
in
the
district
where
you
cannot
admix
anywhere
else
in
the
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
district
of
columbia
clause
has
functions
that
must
be
faced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
you
think
o'donoghue
and
williams
both
require
critical
analysis
if
they're
constitutional
courts,
how
can
they
be
given
non-constitutional
fact
functions
and
if
they
can
be
given
non-constitutional
functions
then
you
got
something
that's
very
different
from
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states
elsewhere?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
anybody
sug
--
why
should
anybody
suggest
that
the
trial
over
which
justice
jackson
presided
for
as
unlike
or
in
anyway
unlike
in
the
sub
--
subject
matter
and
in
the
procedure
was
unlike
the
trial
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
or
the
district
of
massachusetts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
in
controversy,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
if
that
argument
has
any
validity
then
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
were
non-article
iii
judicial
case
in
the
district
court
then
we
must
dismiss
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
we
can't
review
a
nonjudicial
action
by
anybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
better
examine
the
starting
point
of
all
these
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gressman,
you
know
best
how
to
make
use
of
your
time.
it
does
occur
to
me
that
the
line
you're
now
taking
doesn't
call
for
any
use
of
time
namely,
that
the
--
the
process
for
determining
guilt
or
innocence
under
a
charge
of
crime
of
a
federal
statute
is
something
that
must
be
--
must
be
performed,
must
be
exercised
by
a
court.
it
couldn't
be
transferred
to
the
secretary
of
commerce
or
there
--
from
health
and
welfare.
i
don't
see
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
imagine
that
there's
any
contest
on
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
problem
is,
the
problem
is
whether
this
was
a
tribunal
of
law
in
view
of
the
strange
hybrid
that
the
district
court
--
the
courts
present
that
are
involved
here
but
nobody
questions
at
least
i
should
be
shocked
intellectually
somebody
did
question,
that
you
can
deposit
the
task
of
determining
whether
a
man
is
guilty
on
the
penal
statute
to
a
tribunal
other
than
a
conventional
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
i
should
be
delighted
to
be
informed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
understand
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
i
may
say
so
that's
a
very
different
thing
than
to
--
than
to
argue
that
against
which
you're
knocking
an
open
door
namely,
that
what
it
is
in
issue
here
is
a
nonjusticiable
matter
and
therefore
needn't
to
be
tried
by
a
requisite
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
that
argument.
i'm
fully
aware
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
once
congress
exercised
the
choice
which
anteceded
hoboken
land
case,
way
back
wayman
against
southard
that
was
made
clear.
if
congress
takes
one
of
these
things
at
either
it
could
legislated
on
directly
or
put
into
the
executive
branch
or
make
it
a
subject
matter
of
judicial
action.
if
once
it
does
the
latter
and
creates
a
tribunal,
it
made
clear
that
you
indicated
a
minute
ago,
it
made
clear
the
specialized
court
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
trial
of
criminal
cases.
but
if
the
tribunal
is
a
tribunal
under
article
iii,
take
the
old
commerce
court,
which
i
have
restricted
jurisdiction
entirely
with
reference
to
this
day
commerce
matters,
i
don't
suppose
there
was
a
particle
of
doubt
that
every
member
or
any
member
of
that
court
could
have
been
assigned
by
the
chief
justice,
assuming
authority
was
given
by
congress,
it
could
have
been
assigned
by
the
chief
justice
to
try
an
ordinary
criminal
case
in
chicago
or
denver.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
disagree
with
you.
i'm
merely
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
what
you're
arguing
and
thinking
your
time
on
or
rather
i'm
taking
your
time
on
is
to
me,
the
remotest
of
all
questions
in
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
--
to
that,
in
light
of
the
discussion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
have
hold
bakelite
to
decide
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
government's
case
rest
on
overruling
bakelite?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
as
--
i'm
looking
at
its
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
case,
if
you
tell
me
that
the
government
case
depends
on
overruling
bakelite
then
i
apologize
to
you
for
having
me
listen
and
take
me
your
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
special
reasons
were
simple
that
life
tenure
was
gift
that
they
--
it
was
a
tribunal
which
could
do
the
kind
of
--
which
could
adjudicate
matters
that
were
normally
matters
of
court,
could
adjudicate,
the
judges
will
give
them
life
tenure.
that
was
the
special
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--(voice
overlap)
--
but
--
but
it
couldn't
have
been
so
because
one
them
never
sat
on
the
circuit
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
judge
julian
mack.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
haven't
given
them
life
tenure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
decisive
thing,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
assuming
that
they've
satisfied
your
requirement
drawn
from
hoboken
land
case,
that
the
kind
of
business
that
they
have
to
deal
with
is
court
business.
if
it
isn't
that,
then
we
haven't
got
a
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
the
issues
under
that
act
had
to
be
cast
in
form
of
a
nature
that
courts
deal
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
isn't
true
because
under
the
tucker
act,
every
federal
district
court
of
the
united
states
can
pass
on
claims
up
to
$10,000,
which
congress
tomorrow
could
withdraw
from
every
court
and
vest
in
the
secretary
of
commerce
or
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
say
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
it
must
be
my
fault.
i
go
back
to
the
--
to
the
commerce
court.
now,
while
the
judges
for
usable
and
actually
did
sit
in
all
sorts
of
cases
throughout
the
country
as
a
court,
that
court
had
no
jurisdiction
in
diversity
cases
or
as
a
court,
it
had
no
jurisdiction
except
to
review
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
i'm
suggesting
is
--
i'm
suggesting
two
things
mr.
gressman.
(1)
that
congress
of
the
power
to
establish
specialized
court
composed
of
judges
who
are
article
iii
judges.
(2)
that
in
the
district,
congress
has
created
courts
that
have
both
judicial
functions
and
nonjudicial
functions.
they
can
be
vested
with
judicial
duties
and
nonjudicial
duties.
and
although,
you
have
an
admsixture
of
judicial
and
nonjudicial
duties,
it
is
for
purposes
of
those
matters
that
are
confinable
to
courts,
an
article
iii
court
from
which
this
court
or
which
this
court
may
review
on
appeal.
although
it
--
such
power
couldn't
be
vested
to
courts
of
the
united
states
outside
of
the
district.
and
therefore,
when
you
deal
with
--
with
specialized
tribunal,
you've
got
a
problem
different
from
the
problem
of
the
district
courts
throughout
the
country
which
are
vested
in
them
all
the
jurisdiction
that
congress
sees
fit
to
vest
in
federal
courts.
they
couldn't
be
charged
with,
one
of
the
first
things
that
happened.
they
couldn't
be
charged
with
duties
that
are
not
judicial
duties.
this
court
wouldn't
review
judgments
or
determinations,
advisory
opinion
as
you
called
them,
from
them
nor
would
it
from
the
district
where
they
couldn't
decline
to
review
good
judicial
matters
from
the
district
although
that
tribunal
is
also
vested
with
nonjudicial
function.
so
we've
got
a
--
we've
got
an
admixture
of
situations
in
the
district
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
also
specialized
court
that
do
not
eventually
suggest
permit
of
this
nice
checkerboard
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
have
to
encounter,
i
suppose
you
will
if
i
stop
asking
my
questions,
the
fact
that
this
court
with
this
tribunal
is
now
a
full-pledge
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
he
continues
to
be
a
member
of
that
tribunal.i
know
when
this
happened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
he
was
appointed,
it
added
--
it
preceded
the
creation
that
the
transformation
of
that
court
is
to
a
regular
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
saying,
you're
discussing
things
which
seem
to
me
way,
way
over
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
taking
a
minute
to
state
what
kind
of
cases
come
before
this
tribunal
of
the
court
of
customs
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
could
not
be
vested
in
the
district
court?
that
could
not
be
vested
in
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
subject
matter
is
of
a
judicial
nature.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
if
a
tribunal
which
has
this
ambivalent
which
has
--
which
is
given
a
party
over
this
ambivalent
situation
which
may
be
cast
in
--
in
adjudicatory
problem
if
it
is
given
to
a
tribunal
and
that
--
and
congress
gives
that
tribunal
to
life
tenure,
life
tenure.
and
it's
located
at
--
no,
let's
stop
there.
i
do
not
see
--
i
do
not
see
why
then
it
doesn't
satisfy
your
analysis
namely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely
--
the
subject
matter
may
be
--
take
the
la
abra
case,
a
mexican
claim
against
the
government
or
claim
by
the
united
states
citizens.
congress
may
pass
a
statute
and
says
john
jones
is
entitled
a
$3,000,000
from
the
fund
which
makes
it
go
and
turn
over
to
the
united
states.
congress
might
say,
the
secretary
of
treasury
should
determine
the
bona
fides
of
the
claim
or
three,
do
what
it
did
do
and
say,
this
is
a
controversy
to
be
settled
in
an
“honest-to-god”
court.
now,
in
congress
puts
matters
of
that
character,
which
it
could
distribute
--
which
it
could
either
repay
or
give
to
an
executive
authority,
gives
it
to
a
court,
subject
of
case
of
controversy
requirements
and
then
give
that
tribunal
life
tenure.
i
do
not
see
what
is
lacking
in
making
it
a
court
within
the
requirements
of
article
iii.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
congress
--
you
say
that
the
proposal
which
has
been
made
throughout
my
--
my
professional
life
will
have
a
separate
court
of
patent
appeal,
a
patent
court
to
withdraw
the
jurisdiction
in
all
patent
cases
from
the
district
courts
throughout
the
country
and
vested
exclusively
in
a
court
of
patent
jurisdiction
with
no
other
judicial
function
and
given
life
tenure,
that
wouldn't
be
an
article
iii
court.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
i
understand
you
but
i'm
sure
i
rejected
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
the
statutes
gave
it
additional
power.
because
under
the
statute,
congress
can
ask
an
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims,
but
nothing
that
you
quote
from
justice
stone
there
mean
that
if
congress
shows
to
restrict
the
court
of
claims
entirely
to
judicial
business,
it
couldn't
make
of
it
a
constitutional
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
saying
if
tomorrow,
congress
chose
to
vest
the
power
which
now
district
courts
have,
requiring
to
be
constituted
as
a
three-judge
tribunal
to
review
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
provision.
if
commerce
chose
to
have
one
centralized
court
or
say
four,
whatever
the
great
the
divisions,
the
traffic
divisions
of
a
country
are
at
present,
you
say,
that
would
not
be
an
exercise
upon
the
article
iii
if
it
didn't
also
say
those
judges
should
also
have
all
other
powers
and
be
available
for
all
other
duties
of
a
judicial
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know,
but
we're
here
reconsidering
all
the
talk
in
these
cases.
those
cases
arose
out
of
special
circumstances,
and
one
cannot
understand
the
bakelite
case
unless
you
consider
that
that
case
arose
in
connection
with
the
very
troublesome
question
at
that
time
to
what
extent
congress
can
create
nonjudicial
tribunals
for
the
enforcement
of
the
volstead
act.
i
was
about
to
say
that
the
man
in
the
wood
pie.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
this
to
you
before
you
sit
down.
this
will
tell
you
my
difficulty.
let's
see
if
i
can
put
it
clearly.
the
district
--
the
district
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia
have
both
conventional
judicial
functions
and
non-conventional
--
and
nonjudicial
functions.
for
instance,
the
district
courts
for
the
district
of
columbia
can
fix
rate
of
utilities
which
no
u.s.
courts
throughout
the
country
can
do
not
even
--
and
this
court
has
no
power.
it
can
do
that,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
also
tries
conventional
criminal
cases.
now,
the
infusion
of
nonjudicial
business
into
the
powers
of
the
district
court,
do
not
prevent
that
tribunal
from
being
an
“honest-to-god”
article
iii
court
with
reference
to
its
judicial
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
empowerment,
that
investiture
to
use
your
good
word
of
nonjudicial
business
in
the
district
court
derived
from
one
of
the
provisions
of
article
of
section
18
of
article
i,
“the
power
to
deal
with
the
district.”
now,
this
court
has
held
for
obvious
reason
that
article
i
has
a
lot
of
other
provision
giving
congress
power,
such
as
the
power
to
regulate
commerce.
what
for
the
life
for
me,
i
cannot
i
understand
is
why,
if
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
judicial
tribunal
subject
to
review
by
this
court
although
there's
an
infusion
of
this
executive
authority,
why
any
other
tribunal
having
judicial
business
such
as
reparation
suits,
but
also
being
given
some
other
authority
on
the
article
i,
section
3,
why
as
to
those
tribunals,
the
addition
of
those
nonjudicial
matters
would
take
the
whole
things
so
that
they
wouldn't
be
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
have
to
have
article
iii
courts
because
this
court
had
reviewed
judgments
of
territorial
courts
which
were
under
article
iii
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
court
couldn't
possibly
run
or
issue
a
writ
and
review
a
determination
by
the
secretary
of
state
until
he
gets
into
a
lower
court
or
the
secretary
of
commerce
or
anybody
else,
it
has
to
come
here
from
up
court
and
cases
which
come
here
from
the
district
court,
come
from
a
tribunal
which
from
your
point
of
view
is
tainted
because
it
also
has
advisory
capacity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
isn't
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
you
have
to
say.
you
say,
the
court
of
customs
appeal
isn't
a
court
and
congress
couldn't
make
it
such
and
congress
couldn't
agree
at
the
patent
court
of
the
kind
i
have
indicated
because
it
wouldn't
also
be
trying
criminal
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
you
know
what
i
think
about
that
--
that
line
of
argument.
i've
expressed
myself
in
the
tidewater
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it's
--
if
i
may
say
so
respectfully,
angels
dancing
on
a
pin's
head.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
congress
could
establish
courts
restricted
entirely
to
nonjury
cases,
just
have
a
separate
equity
court,
couldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
those
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
elements
that
you
are
arguing
in
this
case,
i
mean
they
can't
decide
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
the
amount
--
they're
relevant
with
the
1922
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
didn't
refer
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
under
that
consideration,
some
of
us
are
in
trouble.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
stretch
ourselves
and
--
and
take
up
every
issue
that
--
that's
intellectually
implied
in
this
litigation
then
i
could
press
you
with
some
questions
on
your
last
statement,
the
congress
doesn't
have
the
power
that
it
has
over
the
district.
but
by
the
tidewater
case,
there's
nothing
but
trouble
for
me,
why
hasn't
any
different
power
under
the
provision
of
section
8
of
article
i
roughly
to
the
district
than
it
has
under
the
commerce
clause
in
the
same
section.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
we
have
to
decide
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
mind
my
having
reference
to
the
answer
i
gave
you,
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
they
could
by
an
act
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
congress
but
the
court
could
be
made
into
one.
and
those
who
had
--
previously
had
a
life
tenure
could
upon
re-nomination
by
the
president
for
good
behavior
term
and
confirmation
by
the
senate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
status.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
say
this
is
not
a
situation
which
need
to
defer
to,
is
it
because
it's
the
jurisdiction
or
the
judiciary
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
that
was
--
that
didn't
meet
with
as
much
fairer
advantage
than
it
does
with
you
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
there
--
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
you
entirely.
i
only
want
to
make
this
qualification.
to
me,
there's
a
difference
when
there
is
an
act
of
congress
whatever
weakens
the
statute,
containing
the
jurisdictional
or
judiciary
problem
using
that
word
as
an
adjective,
and
having
given
that
of
any
thought
that
is
not
now
raised
yet
but
that
was
my
view
in
lincoln
mills
as
you
know
but
after
the
decision
by
this
court
and
consideration
of
the
problem
conscious
consideration
by
the
problem,
by
the
congress
that
was
true
in
these
enactments
after
bakelite,
i
think
you've
got
a
different
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
--
i'm
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
that.
all
i'm
saying
is
where
you've
got
to
deal
with
the
problem
which
is
inherently
returns
difficulties
so
that
men
are
concerned
and
familiarity
with
these
problems
can
--
to
put
it
mildly
take
two
views
the
fact
that
congress,
in
the
light
of
prior
decision
that
this
court
has
taken
the
view
that
it
has,
has
weight
which
wouldn't
be
have
an
issue
of.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
you
mind
being
specific
and
state
what
matters
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
deals
with
that
one
dealt
with
for
50
years
by
judge
hand
sitting
in
the
district
and
circuit
courts
in
the
numerous
patent
and
unfair
trade
cases
that
he
had.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
isn't
--
as
i
understand
it,
that
isn't
--
the
subject
matter
is
non-judicial
but
it
isn't
final
because
the
president
can
exercise
its
political
power
to
--
to
reject
it.isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
you
--
suppose
you
take
it
at
face
value
that
they
differ
from
the
power
which
the
courts
of
the
district
have
which
are
now
constitutional
court
could
fix
the
rates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
tenure
advantage
mr.
robb?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
tenure
of
those
judges
in
the
seventh
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
life.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
do
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you've
said
it
explicitly
that
you
agreed
in
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
way
around
is
justice
black's
trouble
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
other
way
around
is
important
too.
not
that
congress
did
it,
but
couldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
--
was
that
--
what
pre-held
in
tidewaters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
--
i
would
say,
may
it
please
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
sir.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
we
should
heed
common
law
history
but
not
american
history,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
history
of
more
than
100
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
should
hope
--
i
should
suppose
that
in
the
earlier
days,
the
congress
probably
knew
as
much
as
judges,
has
much
part
of
the
constitution
as
we
know
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
justice
lamberth
had
said
that
the
answer
to
the
argument
was,
but
he
got
the
1922
statute
for
purposes
of
assignment
in
the
district.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
read
that
otherwise
on
the
last
page
of
his
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
indicating
that
he
thought
it's
alright
for
them
to
sit
in
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
what
i've
been
trying
to
suggest
to
you
all
through
your
arguments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
possibly
justify
the
commerce
court
on
that
general
talk
of
justice
sutherland
because
that
court
had
nothing
but
a
jurisdiction
which
need
not
have
been
conferred
on
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
court
wasn't
--
the
court
wasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
that
therefore
the
commerce
court
was
not
a
constitutional
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
gressman,
if
that
same
statute
were
passed
today
and
i
was
sitting
on
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
were
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
whereas
to
sit
on
the
commerce
court,
i
could
say
very
respectfully
as
john
jay
did
to
washington,
you're
asking
me
to
perform
non-article
iii
duties
and
to
a
great
respect,
i
decline
to
do
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
talking
across
purposes.
i'm
saying
that
they
couldn't
superimpose
on
me
with
the
enlightenment
you've
given
me,
duties
to
serve
on
a
court
which
is
not
a
constitutional
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
there
is
a
difference
between
a
tribunal
and
the
members
there
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
tribunal
is
charged
with
delegable
duties
so
that
which
congress
as
to
the
emergency
court
could've
left
with
the
food
administrator
or
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
a
tribunal
was
created
according
to
your
insistence
that
was
not
of
an
imperative
judicial
nature
and
no
federal
judge
could
be
compelled
to
serve
a
tribunal
of
an
imperative
non-judicial
nature.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
to
learn
from
your
lesson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
can
do
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
do
it
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
because
hayburn's
case
said
we
wouldn't
do
it.
hayburn's
case
refused
to
do
it,
the
judges
refused
to
exercise
that
power,
why?
because
that
which
they
were
asked
to
do
are
subject
to
review
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
--
according
to
your
definition,
the
commerce
court
was
not
a
judicial
body
in
the
sense
of
article
iii.
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
jurisdiction,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
judges,
its
jurisdiction
--
it
was
given
jurisdiction
over
matters
which
need
not
have
been
conferred
on
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
equally
subject
to
your
condemnation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
all
that
but
it
doesn't
deal
with
your
argument
which
i
thought
of
--
sent
to
it
--
you
said
it's
sent
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
a
court
--
that
as
a
party
isn't
a
judge
free
tribunal
unless
it
has
been
given
by
congress
the
jurisdiction
which
necessarily
must
be
given
to
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
again
what
--
what
you
--
what
reliance
you'd
place
on
the
debate
which
you
referred
a
minute
ago?
what
do
those
debates
show?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
the
word
for
it.
suppose
congress
had
chosen
instead
of
creating
a
separate
court.
suppose
congress
had
chosen
to
confer
that
jurisdiction
to
the
existing
district
of
circuit
courts
of
the
united
states
exclusively
no
--
no
separate
court
of
claims,
would
that
have
been
the
conferment
of
article
iii
jurisdiction
upon
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
that
make
a
difference
--
does
it
make
a
difference
to
the
characteristic,
the
judicial
significance
in
judicial
powers
sense,
in
article
iii
sense
that
it
established
the
separate
court
to
which
that
jurisdiction
was
given
exclusively?
would
that
make
a
difference
to
the
content
of
what
the
business
was
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
was
or
wasn't
judicial
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
or
the
inference
i
would
draw
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
inference
i
would
draw
from
what
you've
just
said
is
that
there
may
be
matters,
argumentatively
to
agree
with
me,
there
may
be
matters
conferred
on
courts
created
under
article
i
which
are
not
"judicial
power
in
the
sense
of
article
iii."
but
what
entitles
you
to
the
logical
or
the
reasonable
inference
that
because
some
tribunals
can
be
created
under
article
i
and
give
them
authority
to
--
to
decide,
avoid
the
word
adjudicate,
to
decide
which
wouldn't
be
given
to
article
iii
courts
that
things
that
could
be
given
to
article
iii
courts
can't
be
vested
in
a
specialized
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is,
what
is
there
in,
excuse
me
--
was
in
there
in
article
iii
which
prevents
congress
from
establishing
article
iii
courts
and
vesting
in
them
limited
jurisdiction.
what
is
there
in
article
iii
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
says
what
would
have
prevented
congress
from
1789
or
if
you
please,
tomorrow
to
create
separate
courts
of
equity,
giving
them
exclusively
equitable
jurisdiction
in
other
courts,
giving
them
exclusively
jurisdiction
on
the
lower
side?
what
is
there
in
article
iii
that
so
fetters
and
confines
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
evade
the
question
as
soon
as
you
talk,
put
a
label
on
it
called
legislative
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
makes
them
legislative
courts
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
your
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
your
thinking
but
in
your
sense
of
legislative
courts
namely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
jurisdiction
that
can't
be
conferred
on
article
iii
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
if
i
understand
you,
congress
can
confer
its
legislative
function
of
settling
claims
against
the
united
states
on
article
iii
courts.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
conjoins
with
that
other
things
then
its
judicial
power
or
va
--
or
the
converse
if
it
convert
--
if
it
exclusively
limits
the
court
to
that
which
congress
could
do
legislatively
then
it
isn't
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
it's
not
an
article
iii
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
do
you
get
that
out
of
article
iii?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
are
now
re-canvassing
the
local
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sure
you
could
bring
many
commission
--
commissions
of
error
against
me.
that
doesn't
make
it
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
anything
that
mattered
with
that
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
decision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
decision,
not
the
talk
but
a
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
unrelated
to
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
tidewater.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
correct
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
correct
you?
there
were
two
opinions
contradicting
one
another
to
both
of
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
totaled
up
to
a
contradictory
but
ex
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
inclusive
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
how
do
you
explain
why
what
i
think
is
the
real
--
the
real
difficulty,
with
the
court
of
claims
as
a
so-called
constitutional
court
has
never
been
canvassed
or
urged
by
counsel
namely,
that
its
judgments
are
entirely
of
the
caprice
of
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
you
say
this
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
congress.
--
except
insofar
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
exception
knits
--
knits
up
the
whole
principle.
congress
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
article
iii
courts
so-called,
the
ordinary
district
courts
in
courts
of
--
in
circuit
courts
--
the
old
circuit
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeal
and
this
court
are
not
exclusively
preoccupied
with
adjudications
against
the
government
involving
exclusively
money
judgments
against
the
government
to
which
congress
can
whistle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
you
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
if
you
cut
away
those
judgments
for
the
court
of
--
court
of
claims,
you've
got
nothing
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
advisory
opinions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
frankly,
advisory
opinions.
but
if
you
cut
away
that
jurisdiction
of
the
district
and
circuit
courts
and
courts
of
appeals
and
this
court,
you
got
a
vast
amount
of
jurisdiction
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
the
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
the
court
of
claims'
judgments
are
entirely
at
the
grace
of
congress
except
insofar
as
a
moral
--
a
moral
claim
behind
it,
doesn't
apply
to
the
regular
courts
of
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
is
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
an
answer
to
my
problem.
but
what
i'm
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
seems
to
me
a
real
basis
for
attack.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i've
given
you
the
answer
to
that.
suppose
therefore,
some
astute
counsel
one
of
these
days
will
say
that
jurisdiction
conferred
on
the
federal
courts
through
the
tucker
act
confer
a
so-called
jurisdiction
which
had
the
defect
namely,
that
the
judgment
is
merely
a
moral
leading
by
the
court,
federal
courts
and
congress
may
disregard
that.
suppose
the
tucker
act
jurisdiction
was
cut
away
from
the
federal
courts,
has
all
the
jurisdiction
left
on
the
bankruptcy,
admiralty,
patents,
diversity
jurisdiction,
constitutional
questions
which
we
decide
everyday
almost
or
every
monday.
all
that's
left,
when
if
that
effect
is
a
--
is
a
valid
effect
then
nothing
is
left
of
the
court
of
claims.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
had
no
tort
jurisdiction.
it
has
exclusively
contract
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
jurisdiction
against
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
each
of
which
involves
a
judgment
which
for
all
that
congress
is
concerned
can
be
a
piece
of
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is,
involving
a
tax
issue
but
always
against
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
bordeau,
i
hope
you'll
leave
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
yourself
enough
time
to
--
to
deal
with
what
was
not
involved
in
the
williams
case,
maybe
the
1953
act
namely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
well,
it's
beyond
the
power
of
congress
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
you
contend
that
it
can
create
a
constitutional
court
of
claims.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
don't
--
it
take
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
derail
you.
i
just
think
that
that's
very
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
justice
black
was
one
of
the
men
who
made
harmony
out
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
made
three
--
three
and
three
contradictory
opinion
is
equal
to
one
vote
company
as
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
english,
that's
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
legal
arithmetic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
want
to
say
before
you
go
on
that
the
tidewater
case
really
didn't
raise
these
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
really
didn't
raise
these
questions
before.
the
tidewater
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
wholly
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean
is
does
the
simple
question
was
whether
diversity
jurisdiction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
could
be
exercised
with
reference
to
denizens
of
the
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
the
district
was
a
state
or
didn't
have
to
be
a
state
or
so
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
two-fold.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
field
then
for
discussion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
deduction
of
your
postulate
that
congress
cannot
create
a
tribunal
to
which
is
given
as
exclusive
jurisdiction
that
with
which
congress
can
deal
legislative,
alright?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
tried
to
follow
your
argument,
i
won't
tell
you
what
i
think
of
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
saying
is
that's
--
as
though
congress
dis
--
tomorrow
afternoon
pass
the
statute
giving
the
director
amend
for
the
director
of
the
budget
your
life
tenure.
that's
all
he
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
go
from
your
postulate
to
the
irrelevance
of
these
other
indicia
of
life
tenure
and
non-reductibility
of
sala
--
salary
instead
of
going
from
this
indicia
to
finding
out
whether
it's
a
court.
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
it's
a
court
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
go
from
your
postulate
--
you
go
from
your
postulate
that
this
can't
be
done
to
saying
that
these
legislative
determinations
are
irrelevant
instead
of
taking
these
incidents
and
from
them
deducing
whether
it
could
be
an
article
iii
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
test
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
mean
to
say
they're
not
irrelevant
but
the
man
doesn't
get
a
salary
he
gets,
but
tomorrow
it
can
be
changed.
that
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they'd
be
talking
nothing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they'd
be
talking
nothing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
beginning
with
what
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
created
a
few
years
ago
there
is
now
sitting
an
indian
--
a
commission
on
indian
claims,
i'd
like
to
have
somebody
tell
me
why
congress
can,
instead
of
doing
what
it
did
to
creating
a
commission
with
limited
tenure
because
it
was
expected,
hopefully
expected
that
those
claims
will
be
settled
in
a
few
years
and
therefore
you
don't
want
to
have
a
lot
of
life
long
functionary.
i
wish
somebody
would
tell
me
so
i
can
understand
it,
why
congress
cannot
create
a
court
to
deal
with
claims
arising
under
treatise
with
the
indians
and
under
statutes
in
relation
to
the
indians
and
give
determination
of
those
issues
with
adjudication
that
is
not
subject
at
least
to
revision
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
or
secretary
of
the
treasury,
bring
to
one
side
the
power
congress
to
withhold
appropriation.
why
congress
couldn't
--
instead
of
giving
that
jurisdiction
as
it
well
might
as
it
has
in
the
past
the
regular
so-called
article
iii
court?
why
it
couldn't
deposit
that
adjudicatory
function
into
a
separate
court.
i
like
to
have
somebody
explain
that
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
addressing
myself
to
the
chief
justice's
question
that
--
but
as
to
--
i
see
no
reason
why
congress
couldn't
have
done
what
it
didn't
do
in
the
cases
giving
rise
to
the
so-called
hayburn's
case,
which
involved
six
separate
determination
for
the
determination
of
pension
claims
by
veterans
of
the
revolutions,
of
the
american
revolution.
i
see
--
i
don't
see
why
congress
can't
confer
that
either
on
court
spread
throughout
the
country
or
a
tribunal
exclusively
dealing
with
it
if
it
didn't
do
--
if
it
--
if
it
avoids
doing
what
it
did
in
that
case,
namely
to
make
the
determinations
contingent
upon
the
secretary
of
treasury
or
war,
i
forget
which,
i
think
treasury
instead
of
war,
approving
of
it.
but
i
was
addressing
myself
with
reference
to
these
indian
claims,
of
these
pension
claims
to
mr.
bordeau's
postulate
that
because
congress
would
pass
an
act,
it
couldn't
turn
it
into
an
honest
to
god
litigation
before
an
honest
to
god
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
shapiro,
i
find
the
two
lawyers
don't
dwell
on
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
operative
concept
of
this
problem,
namely
the
term
of
the
concept
"judicial
power."
the
question
is,
is
it
judicial
power
in
the
undefined
sense
in
which
article
iii
used
them
and
the
undefined
sense
which
defines
from
the
practice
of
those
people
that
holdsworth
and
(inaudible)
construe
that
clause
the
things
familiarly
were
decided
by
courts
of
westminster.
that's
the
guts
of
the
case
to
me.
what
its
judicial
power
--
of
its
judicial
power
and
there's
nothing
in
article
iii
or
any
other
part
of
the
constitution
which
says
you
can't
give
specialized
limited
jurisdiction
as
congress
had
done
time
and
again
with
reference
to
the
court,
the
federal
courts
the
so-called
"unquestioned
federal
court."
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
should
state
what
preceded
that
message
of
lincoln.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
correct
you
--
i
must
correct
you.
section
14
of
that
act
gave
the
secretary
of
treasury
--
of
the
treasury
power
to
modify
the
determination
of
the
court
of
claims.
that
was
the
violence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
abolish
them
tomorrow,
all
of
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
couldn't
--
it
couldn't
terminate
the
service
the
tenure
of
the
judges
but
it
could
abolish
the
court,
not
with
all
court
out,
in
connection
with
the
commerce
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
was
--
the
court
was
created.
the
court
was
abolished.
they
were
judges
having
all
the
incidence
of
article
--
so-called
article
iii
judges
and
therefore
their
tenure
couldn't
be
terminated
but
their
business
was
put
out
of
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
don't
reach
--
if
we
don't
reach
the
question,
the
ultimate
reach
of
the
question
that
whether
the
court
of
claims
is
a
constitutional
court,
whether
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeal,
whether
the
district
court
has
rightly
deemed
the
constitutional
court
or
whether
dissenters
were
right
in
o'donoghue.
if
we
go
off
on
this
national
law
adjudicate
on
de
facto
jurisdiction
of
a
specialized
situation
of
the
district,
we
leave
this
whole
apostating,
metaphysical
mess
where
it
is
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
think
that?
except
on
the
general
question
with
which
i
have
great
sympathy,
you
shouldn't
reach
constitutional
questions
but
it
leaves
--
it
leaves
the
chief
justice
of
united
states
hanging
on
a
limb,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it's
particularly
not
pertinent
here,
because
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
social
policy.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
legislative
policy.
we're
dealing
with
something
regarding
which
this
court
as
--
or
ought
to
have
peculiar
competence
for
decision
since
it
concerns
the
internal
arrangements
of
the
federal
judiciary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
quite
appreciate
your
position
and
as
you
know
it
goes
against
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
strong
general
attitude
most
of
the
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
had
a
petition
for
certiorari
coming
from
the
court
of
claims
reviewing
indian
commission
issues?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
within
a
year,
i
think,
we
had
a
petition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
are
suggesting
that
congress
cannot
create
a
court
to
which
is
given
what
i
call
traditional
conventional
westminster
court
jurisdiction
but
also
gives
it
none
such
or
give
it
a
valuable
opinion
that
that
precluded
from
being
a
court
for
cases
that
are
cases
in
controversy,
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
then
you'll
get
into
a
lot
of
trouble
i
suggest,
suppose
with
the
reference
to
the
court
of
claims
and
with
reference
to
the
district
court
of
columbia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
that
the
question
before
us
wasn't
this
but
the
power
of
a
commission,
the
question
was
as
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims
on
review
of
something
that
the
commission
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
of
course,
it
was
not
only
the
court
of
claims
but
all
the
courts
of
the
--
all
the
courts
of
appeal
of
this
country
review
determinations
of
non-judicial
bodies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
would
have
--
it
would've
had
to
be
not
what
we
thought
about
the
indian
commision
but
what
we
thought
about
the
exercise
of
power
by
the
court
of
claims.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
question
because
this
court
react
and
reviewed
time
out
of
mind
since
the
16th
--
no
the
second
gordon
case
early
in
the
1917,
i
think.
this
court
have
been
reviewing
adjudication
by
the
court
of
claims
for
nearly
100
years
during
all
of
which
time
the
court
of
claims
had
also
had
what
you
indicated,
inquisitorial
or
investigatorial
power
before
congress.
but
for
100
years,
this
court
had
been
sitting
and
deciding
that
the
court
of
claims
is
a
--
the
judicial
body
for
purposes
of
case
of
controversy
to
give
this
court
jurisdiction
although
contemporaneously
the
court
of
claims
have
been
doing
a
lot
of
non-judicial
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
want
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
tenure
part.

that's
the
trouble
in
trying
that
under

as
i
understand
your
position
that
congress
in
concurring

has
(inaudible)
justice

in
what
(inaudible)
justice

about
what?
justice

assuming
not
congress
should
give
all
jurisdictions
that
the

has
with
reference
to
the

in

that
you
have

there's

(inaudible)
permit

justice

(inaudible)
justice

can
you
define
what
the
administrative
(inaudible)
in
determining
the
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact
you're
burning
the
whole
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
(inaudible)
is
that
congress
could
if
to
a
known
judicial
body,
the
same
must
follow
that
the
fact
on
claims
in
the
united

subject
to
the

kind
of
so
called
judicial
procedure
not
entirely
to
be

to
be
uphold
in
order
to
fix
that.
if
it
good
to
itself
therefore
those
--
you
are
to
give
it
to
a
non-judicial
body.
justice
felix

well
but
if
(voice

--
justice

(inaudible)
justice

the
adjudication
of

against
the

may
dispose
of
the

if
not
the

within

judicial

(inaudible)
what
was
necessarily
judicial

congress
then,
as
i
understand
it
deposit
with
the
secretary
of
commerce
impediment
of
claims
between
joe
and
smith
which
was
a
staple
of
westminster
jurisdiction
but
since
claim
against
the

were
not
the

with
westminster
jurisdictions,
he
can
dispose
of
it
in
anyone
(inaudible)
justice

you're
getting
it
to
well
known
very
staple
in
which
legal
problems
when
we
talk
about
the
commissioner
right.
the
checker
court
and
what
they
are.
that
was
not
a
staple
suits
against
the

enforce
it
in
the

or
certainly
nothing
except
by
the
devious
way
petitioner
bribed
the
staple
of
westminster
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
--
just
as
the
court
of
claims
in
westminster
but
i
don't
see
why
you
take
the
burden
of
it
at
all
and
say
congress
couldn't
have
a
non-judicial
body
disposed
of
the
claims
against
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
answer
to
justice
stewart's
(inaudible)
unless
the
federal
court,
those
courts
were
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
we
did
this
morning
is
about
jurisdiction.
