mr.
francis
m.
shea
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
stewart
may
i
add
just
a
footnote
to
under
mark
the
solicitor
general
on
his
last
point.
the
court
of
claims
itself
and
in
rescind
considered
that
the
exercise
of
the
congressional
reference
power
was
as
commissioners
and
so
stated.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
has
commissioners.
but
they
exercised
their
powers
as
commissioners
and
judge
madden
when
the
1953
act
was
before
the
congress
indicated
to
the
appropriate
committee
that
they
might
well
no
longer
be
in
a
position
to
require
the
court
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction
although
it
was
indicated
that
as
a
voluntary
matter
they
would
exercise
it.
and
i
suppose,
since
hayburn's
case
itself,
the
--
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out
for
judges
to
take
on
the
three
of
the
judges,
at
least
in
hayburn's
case
jay,
duane
and
cushing,
indicated
that
they
could
take
on
that
function
which
was
non-judicial
as
commissioners.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
and
it's
a
matter
of
grace.
it
couldn't
be
required
to.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
wonder
if
in
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
and
five
of
the
judges
who
sat
on
and
told
them
they
had
dispute
could
have
declined.
now,
i
wonder
if
i
might
possibly,
in
my
limited
time,
be
most
hopeful
to
the
court
if
i
could
seek
some
points
of
reference
which
might
be
considered
still
fixed
in
this
maze
of
complexity.
in
the
first
place,
it
seems
to
me
reasonably
clear
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
were
in
cant
and
anxious
to
be
certain
that
those
exercising
judicial
power
were
independent
and
could
not
be
put
under
the
coercion
by
the
other
two
branches
of
the
government.
they
were
thinking
of
judicial
power,
i
suppose,
in
the
traditional
sense.
certainly,
they
could
not
have
had
in
mind
the
kind
of
subtleties
which
we
had
been
discussing
today.
if
they
were
thinking
in
terms
of
the
jurisdiction
customarily
exercised
by
the
courts
in
westminster,
they
were
competent
lawyers
there
whom
i
assume
knew
that
going
back
as
far
as
the
14th
century
the
courts
of
westminster
to
with
court
of
chancery
and
the
king's
bench
had
exercised
just
the
kind
of
jurisdiction
that
is
exercised
by
the
court
of
claims,
the
petition
of
right,
monstrans
de
droit,
the
traverses
of
office.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
traverses
of
office.
in
short,
they
were
anxious
to
protect,
it
seems
to
me,
the
exercise
of
the
kind
of
judicial
power
that
the
court
of
claims
is
exercising
from
--
from
the
coercion
or
influence
of
the
other
departments
of
the
government.
and
i
would
suppose
that
the
court
of
claims
needs
the
protection
as
much
as
any
court
in
the
judicial
system
that
is
likely
to
come
into
conflict
with
the
congress
and
the
executive
department.
it's
not
--
it's
passing
on
large
problems
involving
large
sums
of
money
but
it's
also
passing
on
critical
constitutional
rights
involving
the
bill
of
rights
problems,
involving
civil
rights
problems.
there
was
before
this
court
in
o'donoghue
the
question
of
the
independence
of
the
judiciary
coming
up
in
the
in
the
guise
of
the
pahy
case.
in
the
lovett
case,
the
question
of
the
bill
of
attainder;
there
are
recently
been
before
the
court
questions
of
whether
or
not
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
in
a
courts
martial
case
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
sixth
amendment
for
instance.
so
that
i
would
suppose
that
this
was
the
kind
of
exercise
of
judicial
power
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
wanted
to
protect
against
the
coercion
of
the
other
departments
and
that
this
court
would
not
deny
that
protection
unless
it's
compelled
by
persuasive
argument
that
the
constitution
would
not
permit
it.
now,
let
me
go
on
to
one
or
two
other
points
that
i
should
hope
were
still
fixed
points
of
reference.
i
would
suppose
that
there
was
no
contest
about
the
proposition
that
the
constitution
doesn't
invest
jurisdiction
in
any
court
except
this.
i
suppose
that
it
is
--
it
is
clear
that
what
the
constitution
does
is
authorizing
power
the
congress
and
give
the
congress
discretion
to
create
inferior
courts
to
ordain
and
establish
inferior
courts.
and
i
would
have
thought
before
the
arguments
in
the
lurk
case
and
this
that
there
had
never
been
any
question
that
congress
might
give
as
much
or
as
little
of
the
powers
specified
in
the
second
section
of
article
iii
as
it
chose
to
give
to
such
a
court
and
that
have
ordained
and
established
a
court
under
article
iii
and
give
it
nothing
but
the
tucker
act
jurisdiction
there'd
be
no
doubt
that
it
could
established
that
as
an
article
iii
court.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
would
there
be
what?
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
should
have
thought
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
about
that
into
argument
advance
today
that
congress
ordained
and
established
an
inferior
tribunal
and
gave
it
only
federal
question
jurisdiction.
indeed,
i
--
i
have
supposed
that
--
that
the
argument
that
in
the
constitutional
convention
was
how
much
of
this
going
to
be
taken,
how
much
can
congress
take
away
from
the
state.
but
it
didn't
have
to
take
it
away.
i
would
have
thought
that
clear,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
from
the
time
of
what
is
it
cary
against
curtis
right
straight
through
the
lockerty
case
which
was
decided
after
williams
and
--
and
bakelite
that
no
doubt
had
ever
been
raised
about
this
issue.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
the
municipal
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
i
think,
is
to
be
explained
in
terms
of
an
exception.
i
think
that
--
that
the
canter
case
was
based
on
a
reasonable
--
a
reasonable
position
and
that
is
that
the
congress
in
the
territories
may
exercise
both
the
national
power
and
the
power
of
the
state
legislature
and
can
set
up
and
that's
all
that
was
involved
in
the
canter
that
they
could
set
up
a
government
for
the
--
for
the
territory
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
and
they
have
to
set
up
legislature
courts
and
so
forth.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
--
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
national
part,
in
the
territory
which
is
not
a
part
of
the
nation.
what
canter
says
and
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
certainly
familiar
with
it
but
i
suppose
territory
--
where
there
has
been
taken
out
of
--
of
--
of
the
state's
jurisdiction
forth
et
cetera,
et
cetera
that
they're
in
a
situation
of
a
territory.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
this
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
had
thought
that
there
was
no
doubt
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
about
the
proposition
that
congress
could
ordain
and
establish
an
inferior
court
under
article
iii
and
give
it
only
a
federal
question
jurisdiction
that
is
that
they
didn't
have
to
give
it
--
they
didn't
--
don't
have
to
give
it
that
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
would
have
thought
so,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
be
that
if
they
can
do
that
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
would
have
thought
that
--
that
it
could
not.
i
would
have
thought
that
if
they
could
do
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
can
do
that,
they
can
just
destroy
the
federal
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
system.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
can
confer
it
on
the
secretary
of
commerce.
yes,
your
honor.
but
may
i
--
may
i
suggest
this
in
regard
to
that.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
no
time
to
for
update,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
may
i
suggest
this
to
your
honor
as
a
response
i'm
trying
to
make
to
the
question,
i
would
have
thought
that
--
that
--
that
one
of
the
fixed
points
was
while
to
be
sure
administrative
agencies
may
deal
with
matters
that
are
within
section
2
of
article
iii
that
if
congress
intend,
if
congress
puts
that
power
in
a
judicial
tribunal,
the
judicial
tribunal
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
i
think
it
can
give
to
a
non-judicial
body.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
have
no
--
i
have
no
difference
about
that
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
that
certainly
was
held
in
canter.
if
it
isn't
--
if
it
doesn't
give
him
life
tenure,
it's
a
non-judicial
body
but
if
--
if
congress
attempts,
if
congress
sets
up
not
in
territories
but
if
it
sets
up
within
the
nation
a
judicial
tribunal,
now
you
--
you've
raised
the
question
as
to
what
is
judicial
tribunal.
but
in
any
event,
your
honor
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
the
staple
loop
westminster
hall
jurisdiction,
westminster
hall
certainly
had
a
lot
of
jurisdiction.
under
the
petition
of
right
that
and
the
other
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
exercised
the
great
deal
of
jurisdiction
under
the
various
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well
your
honor,
certainly
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
insofar
as
i
know
except
for
the
footnote
in
--
in
mr.
chief
justice
vinson
in
the
tide
--
tidewater
case
has
constantly
asserted
that
--
that
the
judicial
power
of
article
iii
in
the
nation,
not
in
the
territories,
but
in
the
nation
can
only
be
invested
in
article
iii
courts.
but
in
any
event,
as
you
point
out,
i
don't
have
to
carry
that
burden
on
whether
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i'm
sorry.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
may
i
only
say
this
in
conclusion,
your
honor.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
--
that
there
are
some
fix
points
of
reference
left.
the
question
presented
is
not
whether
congress
could
put
this
in
article
i
court
so
called.
the
question
is
have
they
ordained
and
established
an
article
iii
court.
certainly,
the
jurisdiction
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out
is
jurisdiction
that
falls
within
the
definition
of
those
items
in
section
2
of
article
iii.
can
congress
--
why
can't
congress
ordain
and
establish
an
article
iii
court
to
exercise
exclusively
apart
from
these
congressional
reference
cases
exclusively
power
jurisdiction
defined
in
the
section
--
second
section
of
article
ii?
at
least
it
is
not
to
be
set
that
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
congress
who
had
done
everything
they
can
to
do
this.
they
have
a
reasonable
basis
on
which
to
do
it
even
if
arguments
can
be
made
to
the
country
and
that
where
congress
has
done
everything
it
can
to
exercise
the
power
clearly
invested
in
it.
why
shouldn't
the
normal
deference
of
this
court
to
the
exercise
of
congressional
power
unless
clearly
it
can't
be
done
allow
congress
to
exercise
the
power
given
to
it
to
ordain
and
establish
such
a
court
to
exercise
jurisdiction
that
could
clearly
be
given.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well
now,
i
take
it
your
honor
is
saying
why
can't
they
require
them
to
do
it.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
or
--
or
do
you
mean
could
--
could
the
courts
throw
up
the
country
exercise?
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
i
would
--
it
seems
to
me
the
solidest
ground,
your
honor.
as
you
know,
distinction
has
been
made.
the
solicitor
general
has
--
has
made
it
that
on
the
basis
of
the
o'donoghue
case.
the
specialized
tribunal
in
the
district
of
columbia
at
least
could
be
invested
with
power
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
but
what
that
case
says
is
that
the
article
iii
while
it's
an
article
iii
court,
nevertheless,
it
may
under
article
i
be
given
supplementary
powers.
now,
my
own
feeling
is
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes,
but
i
think
o'donoghue
says
arti
--
the
court
was
created
under
article
iii.
it
exercised
article
iii
power
but
as
congress
has
plenary
power
of
the
district,
it
may
exercise
its
article
i
power
to
add
some
powers.
now,
and
--
and
--
but
this
couldn't
be
done
and
said
o'donoghue
in
the
states.
now,
so
far
as
the
court
of
claims
is
concerned,
i
think
the
solidest
ground
to
stand
is
the
ground
that
court
of
claims
itself
stood
on
and
in
rescind.
and
so
far
as
that's
concerned
your
honors,
so
long
as
--
as
--
it's
not
imposing
the
jurisdiction
on
the
district
courts
or
the
--
or
the
--
or
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal.
i
supposed
since
the
ferreira
case,
so
long
as
it's
being
done
as
a
commissioner
is
an
act
of
grace
on
the
part
of
the
court,
this
doesn't
--
this
doesn't
threaten
the
court
system.
and
i
--
i
would
feel
that
that
was
a
--
a
solidest
ground
to
stand
on
in
regard
to
that
--
to
that
jurisdiction.
thank
you,
your
honor.
