mr.

in
order
that
you
may
make
your
other
points
and
conclude
your
argument
in
a
comprehensive
way,
i'm
going
to
give
you
ten
--
ten
minutes
more
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
although,
your
time
is
expired
and
if
the
solicitor
general
needs,
he
may
have
it
too.
chief

mr.

chief

we'll
recess

chief
justice

warren
--
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
state
that
again
general,
i
didn't
get
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
general
may
--
may
i
ask
you
before
you
leave
that
point,
if
congress
could
pass
a
statute
authorizing
the
assignment
of
municipal
judges
of
the
district
--
to
the
district
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
if
we
--
if
we
decided
on
this
limited
theory,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this
question.
but
the
statute
says
that
the
chief
justice
may
assign
a
member
of
the
court
of
the
--
court
of
patent
and
appeals
to
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
he
professes
to
do
so,
would
he
have
the
power,
do
you
think,
to
restrict
him
insofar
as
his
being
a
district
judge
is
concerned
by
saying
that,
“well,
i
will
assign
you
but
i
will
only
assign
you
to
take
care
of
the
local
cases
involving
local
law”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
my
--
my
point
is
simply
this,
that
if
he
is
a
district
judge,
is
he
not
a
district
judge
one
is
defined
without
any
limitation
can
be
placed
for
him
by
anyone
except
that
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
laws
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
do
powers
of
the
district
judges?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
we
ought
to
consider
also
that
when
the
chief
justice
assigns
a
judge
as
a
district
judge,
the
chief
judge
of
a
circuit
also
has
the
right
to
use
him
as
a
member
of
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
you
think
that
before
1958,
it
was
constitutional
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
legislative
history
they
show
why
congress
acted
in
1958?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
was
saying
of
this,
general,
suppose
--
suppose
that
this
session
of
congress,
an
act
would
be
passed
making
the
tax
courts
a
constitutional
court
in
giving
him
permanent
--
permanent
tenure,
do
you
think
that
because
they
are
now
enable
to
--
to
adjudicate
cases
that
that
would
make
the
judges
who
would
retire
prior
to
that
time,
judges
capable
of
assignments
throughout
the
country?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
i
know.

justice

justice

my

here.
chief

so
let's
--
yes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
--
i
understand
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief

it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gressman,
the
--
the
court
takes
notice
of
the
fact
that
you're
appointed
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
represent
this
indigent
defendant
and
that
you've
not
only
carry
it
through
your
obligation
there
what
you've
done
here
in
a
very
extensive
and
a
very
able
way
and
we're
very
grateful
to
you
for
what
you
have
--
what
you
have
done.
we
thank
you
--
we
thank
you
mr.
robb
for
your
representation
of
--
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
of
course,
you,
mr.
solicitor
general
for
your
helpful
manner
representing
the
government.

no.
chief

(inaudible)
mr.
bordeau,
you
may
have
five
minutes
to
summarize
in
conclusion
if
you
--
if
you
wish
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you,
mr.
shapiro,
if
you
need
it,
you
may
have
five
minutes
more
too.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shapiro,
the
--
the
congress,
at
least
in
the
last
session
was
giving
some
consideration
to
the
establishment
of
a
--
a
court
to
settle
the
pension
claims,
veterans
claims
of
all
kinds.
and
suppose
they
did
set
up
a
court
just
for
that
--
just
for
that
purpose
and
said
we'll
give
life
tenure
and
--
and
protection
against
reducing
their
salaries,
would
that
--
would
that
in
and
of
itself
make
--
make
that
the
kind
of
a
court
that
--
that
would
be
article
iii
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
think
that
straying
very
far.
they
are
--
they
are
deciding
claims
against
the
government
just
as
the
court
of
claims
is
deciding
claims
against
the
government
and
--
and
supposing
that
they
give
them
that
power
and
--
and
said,
"well,
now,
they
are
an
article
iii
court,
would
that
--
would
--
would
those
things
in
and
of
themselves
make
it
a
three-judge
court?"
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
they
would
--
article
iii
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
of
course
the
issue
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
question
--
is
that
question
before
us?
there
is
no
--
i
don't
think
anybody
questioned
with
what
congress
could
establish
a
court
of
that
kind.
but
my
question
knowning
the
--
went
to
this,
does
that
in
and
of
itself
make
it
an
article
iii
court.
and
that's
the
only
problem
we've
got
here.
i
don't
know
that
anybody
is
contending
that
congress
had
no
power
to
establish
a
court
of
that
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
include
cases
and
controversies?
chief
justice
earl
warren
only?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
are
those
indian
claims
really
cases
and
controversies
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
the
reason
i
asked
you
the
question,
i
seem
to
remember
i
may
be
wrong
but
that
there's
something
in
that
act
which
says
that
the
indian
claims
commission
may
decide
those
claims
without
regard
to
law
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
correctly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
until
2:30.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
assume
--
if
your
argument
being
true
to
saying
that
congress
has
imposed
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
am
i
correct?
am
i
correct
in
(inaudible)
if
i
may
say
this
true
(inaudible)
to
say
that
any
respective
court
that
congress
sets
up
(inaudible)
that
it
may
impose
upon
those
courts
any
constitutional
law
(inaudible)
to
which
claims
(inaudible)
whether
in
fact
biased?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shea.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
what
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
when
--
but
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
want
to
ask
(inaudible)
this
traditional
congressional
reference
power
to
the
court
of
claims?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
might
(inaudible)
the
courts
--
the
courts
of
what
they
have
done
in
the
--
with
the
court
of
claims?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
a
specific
--
specific
congressional
power.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
government's
had
another
jurisdiction
under
the
powers
of
the
congress.
