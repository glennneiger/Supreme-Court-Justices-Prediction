mr.
archibald
cox
may
it
please
the
court?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
(voice
overlap)
--
will
focus
--
i
think
it
perhaps
ties
in
with
what
was
going
to
be
the
beginning
of
my
argument
if
i
might
give
you
a
very
short
answer
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
for
subject
to
explanation.
let
me
say
this
that
i
think
no
question
is
presented
necessarily
in
this
case
concerning
how
a
man
may
be
tried
for
a
federal
offense
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
or
the
district
of
nevada
that
the
question
here
is
whether
this
court
was
lawfully
constituted
to
try
the
petitioner
for
the
cri
--
local
crime
of
burglary
in
the
district
of
columbia.
and
there's
a
world
of
history
back
at
the
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia.
so
that
i
would
also
say
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right,
for
reasons
i'll
try
to
explain,
to
be
tried
for
a
local
offense
in
the
district
of
columbia
before
a
judge
with
security
of
compensation
and
tenure
in
the
constitutional
sense.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
will
try
to
--
that
--that
is
the
first
proposition
on
which
we
rest
our
case.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
at
the
beginning
the
importance
in
this
case.
first,
of
avoiding,
entangling
it
in
broader
constitutional
issues
than
the
case
necessarily
presents.
and
second,
of
avoiding
the
difficulty
which
i
found,
i
fell
into
very
often
and
thinking
about
the
case
of
dealing
with
abstractions,
entangling
niceties
rather
than
what
people
do
and
what
rights
they
may
have.
now,
it
seems
that
the
only
issue
which
has
to
be
decided
on
the
merits
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
which
convicted
the
petitioner
was,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
legally
constituted
for
the
purpose
of
trying
a
local
charge
of
robbery
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
to
state
that
question
conversely,
it's
whether
the
trial
for
criminal
violation
of
the
district
of
columbia
code
before
a
court
known
as
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia,
but
presided
over
by
a
judge
from
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
violated
any
of
the
petitioner's
legal
rights.
i
state
of
course
in
that
fashion
for
a
reason
i
indicated
a
moment
so
that
we
are
much
more
likely
to
reach
the
proof,
i
think,
by
avoiding
these
undefined
terms
like
judicial
power
of
the
united
states,
article
iii
court,
legislative
court,
constitutional
court,
all
which
i
suspect
to
give
and
shifting
meanings
throughout
of
the
argument
and
instead
pursuing
to
direct
lines
of
inquiry.
first,
whether
the
authority
of
judge
jackson
to
preside
at
the
petitioner's
trial
can
be
traced
back
to
an
origin
in
the
constitution;
second,
if
it
can,
then
the
question
arises
whether
the
power
was
exercised
in
a
manner
which
violates
any
statutory
or
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioner.
and
this
does
involve,
i
think,
looking
at
what
was
done
in
concrete
and
specific
instances.
here,
there's
no
question
about
the
validity
of
the
assignment
of
judge
jackson
to
sit
in
this
court,
which
was
signed
by
the
chief
justice
on
december
7th,
1959.
the
authority
to
make
the
assignment
is
derived
from
section
293
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
--
united
states
code.
but
i
would
emphasize
that
although
that
general
power
to
assign
a
judge
of
the
court
of
claims
or
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
to
any
circuit
or
any
district
originated
in
1958,
there
was
a
particular
power
to
assign
a
judge
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
to
sit
in
the
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia,
either
the
supreme
court
is
it
then
was
known,
now
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
and
if
that
statute
was
enacted
in
1922.
it
was
enforced
at
the
time
judge
jackson
was
appointed
to
what
was
life
tenure
by
the
statute
and
he
must
have
been
appointed
by
the
president,
gratified
and
confirmed
by
the
senate
with
a
view
to
that
possible
assignment.
indeed,
as
judge
prettyman's
concurring
opinion
in
the
court
below
points
out,
this
is
an
interchange
which
has
taken
place
very
frequently.
i
should
also
add
that
burglary
is
of
course
a
local
crime
defined
in
the
district
of
columbia
code
which
may
be
tried
under
the
district
of
columbia
code
in
the
court
known
as
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia.
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
the
case
stands
exactly
as
if
congress
had
specifically
provided
for
the
charge
of
robbery
in
the
district
of
columbia,
should
be
tried
in
a
court
with
this
title.
a
court
which
should
have
normal
judicial
powers
who
function
in
the
matter
common
to
most
courts,
which
should
have
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
courts
scattered
through
the
country,
which
also
should
have
jurisdiction
over
local
crimes
committed
in
the
district
and
of
suits
between
citizens
of
the
district
meeting
certain
requirements
and
which
should
further
exercise
certain
legislative,
executive,
and
administrative
functions.
and
over
which
there
should
preside
either
a
judge
known
as
the
district
judge
or
a
judge
known
as
a
judge
of
the
united
states
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
in
other
words,
it
stands
exactly
as
if
the
congress
had
said
in
so
many
words
that
a
local
charge
of
burglary
in
the
district
of
columbia
may
be
tried
before
a
court
presided
over
by
a
judge
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
and
the
petitioner
cannot
possibly
prevail
in
this
case,
i
submit,
unless
he
can
show
either
that
congress
would
have
had
no
constitutional
power
to
enact
such
a
statute
or
else
that
its
enactment
with
the
provisions
here
violated
some
specific
limitation,
giving
him
constitutional
rights.
now,
we
find
the
authority
to
enact
such
a
statute
and
therefore,
this
body
of
statute
is
having
this
effect
in
article
i,
section
8,
clause
17,
giving
the
congress
power
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
such
district
as
may
become
to
seat
of
the
government.
and
congress
has
exercised
that
power
creating
courts
in
which
the
judges
do
not
have
life
tenure,
giving
those
courts
duties
which
would
not
be
regarded
as
proper
to
give
to
judges
of
an
article
iii
court
for
--
well
over
a
hundred
--
indeed
over
150
years.
the
expressions
of
this
court
summarized
the
point
by
saying
that
congress
exercises
the
combined
powers
of
a
general
and
of
the
state
government
in
all
cases
where
legislation
is
possible
in
dealing
with
the
district
of
columbia.
and
this
power
to
function
as
the
local
sovereign
certainly
includes,
we
submit,
the
power
to
declare
crimes
and
the
power
to
create
the
courts
in
which
those
crimes
shall
be
tried.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
--
no,
no
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
assume
and
concede
indeed
that
in
exercising
this
--
by
putting
one
sentence
first
and
come
in
directly
to
your
point.
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
no
one
would
challenge
the
right
of
a
state
to
provide
that
burglary
should
be
tried
in
such
a
court
as
that
in
which
the
petitioner
was
tried.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
congress
exercises
the
powers
of
the
state
in
relation
to
the
district
of
columbia
as
has
often
been
said
then
congress
must
have,
under
article
i,
the
power
to
establish
this
kind
of
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
suggest
not.
let
me
--
because
this
is
the
same
as
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
congress
is
subject
in
exercising
its
article
i
power
over
the
district
of
columbia
to
the
limitations
provided
in
the
bill
of
rights
just
as
it
is
subject
to
those
limitations
in
exercising
any
other
legislative
power.
and
it
is
therefore
subject,
we
would
grant,
to
the
provision
granting
a
right
to
trial
by
jury.
equally,
we
would
say
that
it
was
subject
to
the
due
process
clause.
and
i
would
think
justice
harlan
to
deal
with
your
point
explicitly
that
an
attempt
to
try
a
man
for
crime
before
an
agency
constituted
as
the
interstate
commerce
commission
before
the
district
of
columbia
commissioners,
not
functioning
in
a
judicial
manner,
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
in
other
words,
i
take
it
that
due
process
includes
a
right
as
justice
frankfurter
suggested
earlier
to
a
judicial
proceeding
--
mr.
archibald
cox
they
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
well
one
of
--
of
course
one
of
the
difficulty
is
that
telling
about,
“could
you
try
this
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
it
depends
partly
on
what
do
you
mean
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
what
procedure
do
you
envisage?”
if
the
procedure
is
near
enough
to
what
we
think
of
as
a
judicial
procedure
in
the
states
that
--
commonly
exercised
by
anglo-american
courts
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
requirements
of
due
process
are
met
and
any
requirements
that
i
think
of
in
the
bill
of
rights
are
met
provided
that
the
--
there
is
a
jury
and
of
course
if
it's
been
in
no
violation
of
other
provisions
of
the
fourth
or
fifth
amendments,
unlawful
search
and
seizure
and
things
like
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
recess,
i
was
attempting
to
develop
an
antinomy
to
propositions,
both
of
which
are
really
necessary
to
set
forth
our
position.
the
first
is,
that
in
exercising
its
power
to
govern
the
district
of
columbia,
a
power
roughly
equivalent
to
that
of
a
state
government,
the
congress
is
not
required
to
create
courts
for
the
trial
of
local
offenses
which
have
all
the
characteristics
of
a
court
created
under
article
iii,
judges
with
tenure,
security
and
compensation
and
the
like.
at
the
same
time,
i
must
couple
with
that,
the
proposition
that
there
are
limitations
imposed
as
i
see
it
by
the
bill
of
rights
including
specifically
the
guarantee
of
a
right
to
jury
in
trial
and
the
right
when
one
is
charged
with
crime
under
the
due
process
clause
to
a
judicial
determination
using
judicial
in
a
more
general
sense
that
not
speaking
specifically
of
judges
who
have
the
security
that
article
iii
gives
the
justices
of
this
court
and
the
judges
of
courts
created
under
that
article.
let
me
put
this
specifically,
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
inhibition
against
creating
a
special
criminal
court
for
the
trial
of
local
crimes
committed
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
the
judges
of
which
would
be
elected
for
14-year
terms
and
subject
to
reelection
as
under
the
missouri
claim
or
in
the
manner
found
in
the
other
states.
more
specifically
and
to
draw
for
a
second
example
on
a
condition
which
has
existed
for
150
years,
there
is
no
objection
to
congress
providing
that
offenses
in
the
district
of
columbia
shall
be
tried
either
before
a
special
criminal
court
as
they
were
for
many
years
or
in
a
municipal
court,
the
judges
of
which
have
a
10-year
term.
also,
they
are
appointed
by
the
president.
there's
no
election
as
there
is
in
some
state.
this
has
been
true
for
all
history.
now,
that
jurisdiction
does
not
extend
to
the
trial
of
felonies.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
lurk
could
have
been
tried
in
the
district
court
before
a
judge
with
a
10-year
term.
mr.
archibald
cox
defense
is
not
--
not
carrying
a
sentence
to
the
penitentiary.
mr.
archibald
cox
up
to
a
year,
yes.
the
point,
however,
i
think
justice
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
believe,
sir.
oh,
yes,
yes.
and
there's
a
right
of
--
to
a
judicial
proceeding
i
would
say
under
the
due
process
clause.
but
there
is
not
by
virtue
of
the
statute
and
never
has
been
in
history
a
right
to
a
trial
for
offenses
below
the
greater
felony
before
a
judge
carrying
security
of
tenure
and
compensation.
and
when
say
that
that
is
not
required
under
the
power
to
govern
in
the
district
of
columbia.
now
the
question
was
put
to
me
and
i
committed
partly
on
it
but
i
perhaps
might
put
it
in
its
context
here,
could
a
local
trial
be
tried
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
i
would
say
that
such
administrative
agency
is
--
as
i
know
it,
does
not
proceed
in
the
manner
of
a
court.
the
staff
takes
a
part
in
the
decision
in
the
way
that
it
is
not
customary
in
the
court.
but
there
is
of
course
no
jury
trial
but
i
assume
that
to
pin
my
answer
to
that
would
begging
a
question.
i
don't
need
to
that.
there
are
other
departures
from
customary
judicial
proceeding
which
would
cast
doubt
upon
any
such
statue
if
congress
were
to
enact.
an
interesting
question
which
was
suggested
by
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
douglas
is,
well,
could
congress
provide
that
in
the
event
of
one
of
the
judges
of
the
municipal
court
would
seek
that
his
place
should
be
filled
by
a
man
chosen
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
to
that,
i
simply
want
to
make
one
comment.
possibly
the
--
possibly,
the
right
to
a
judicial
proceeding
includes
the
right
to
be
tried
before
a
judge
who
has
had
some
experience
with
the
law.
i
--
and
in
interstate
commerce
commission,
there
would
not
necessarily
have
had
a
broader
experience
with
the
law.
but
i
submit
that
that
case,
this
hypothetical
case
of
selecting
a
--
an
interim
judge
to
fill
the
vacancy
from
the
ranks
of
an
administrative
agency
isn't
before
us
here
even
putting
the
worst
face
on
the
government's
case.
judge
jackson
was
a
judge
who
was
appointed,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
after
prior
judicial
experience,
with
a
view
to
service
not
only
on
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
but
on
the
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia.
second
--
and
it
was
confirmed
with
the
law
in
that
condition.
second,
he
was
given
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
said
he
was
appointed
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
with
a
view
to
service
not
only
in
the
courts
of
--
and
--
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
but
also
to
service
on
the
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
statutes
authorized
that
at
that
time
and
prior
to
his
appointment,
some
judges
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
as
i
understand
had
said
in
those
courts.
there
was
nothing
--
i
don't
know
how
much
it
was
taken
into
mind,
i
don't
mean
to
say
the
specific
evidence,
but
the
statute
contemplated
and
it
was
not
as
judge
prettyman
shows
an
extraordinary
thing.
in
addition,
judge
jackson
did
have
so
far
as
the
congress
and
president
could
give
it
to
him,
security
of
tenure
and
security
of
compensation.
the
only
possible
qualification
that
i
can
see
on
his
having
those
characteristics
as
of
the
time
he
was
first
appointed
was
that
one
congress
is
assumed
not
to
be
able
to
buy
in
succeeding
congress.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
seem
to
me,
the
only
thing
that
is
ad
hominem
about
that
was
my
gratuitous
remark
that
he
had
had
prior
judicial
services.
i
would
say
that
none
of
the
others
are
gratuitous
or
irrelevant.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
nor
fact
that
he
was
appointed
after.
mr.
archibald
cox
nor
that
the
senate
and
the
house
had
given
him
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
in
his
prior
services.
it's
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
now
that
was
a
bit
of
--
counsel's
getting
carried
away
too
much
but
what
it
can
make
the
most
of
the
fact
of
this
case
but
all
the
risk,
i
submit,
go
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
hypothetical
case
of
a
trial
before
an
interstate
commerce
commission.
now
to
put
the
bar
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
that
--
i
think
that
one
must
distinguish
at
this
point
with
respect
to
the
kinds
of
cases
that
come
before
the
district
court.
i
would
say
that
there
was
--
i
would
draw
this
distinction
and
i
think
it's
important
in
reference
to
a
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
black.
let
me
put
it
this
was
and
i
--
i
assure
you,
i'm
coming
to
the
answer
to
your
question
which
takes
more
than
one
sentence.
mr.
gressman
argues
that
article
iii,
quoting
from
the
o'donoghue
case,
gives
the
citizens
of
the
district
of
columbia
the
constitutional
right
to
have
their
cases
heard
by
article
iii
courts
just
as
the
inhabitants
of
the
various
states.
now,
the
first
by
that
was
not
in
any
sense
necessary
to
the
decision.
but
more
important,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
an
undifferentiated
statement
that
require
some
examination
as
to
what
is
meant
by
--
have
their
cases
heard
before
an
article
iii
court
of
what
kinds
of
cases.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
at
least
three
different
kinds
of
cases
mr.
chief
justice
that
we
might
have
in
mind
here.
the
first
is
local
crimes,
offenses
against
the
district
of
columbia
code
which
would
not
be
offenses
against
the
united
states
if
they
were
committed
in
maryland
or
virginia
or
some
other
state.
and
that
is
what
we
have
in
this
case
and
only
that.
now
a
second
type
of
case
might
be
the
general
federal
crimes
such
as
a
violation
of
the
dyer
act
carrying
a
stolen
motor
vehicle
across
the
state
line
or
violation
of
the
mann
act
or
a
criminal
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
a
third
kind
of
case,
of
course,
would
be
a
civil
case
such
as
the
big
antitrust
case,
united
states
against
parke
and
davis
that
was
heard
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
it's
the
violation
of
the
general
law
and
not
one
confined
to
the
local
code.
i
further
would
--
so
that
i've
got
two
violations
of
local
law
and
violations,
civil
or
criminal
of
federal
law.
now
the
fed
--
violations
of
federal
law,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
might
permit
of
a
constitutional
distinction
between
citizens
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
citizens
of
other
state.
however,
the
point
that
i
would
emphasize
is
that
we
are
dealing
only
with
the
local
criminal
offense
so
that
i
say
that
your
question,
“could
congress
pass
a
statute
authorizing
a
municipal
court
judge
to
sit
in
the
district
court?”
i
would
say
that
it
could
authorize
a
municipal
court
judge
to
sit
at
the
trial
of
a
local
crime
such
as
this
robbery.
and
that
--
that
is
a
very
different
question
than
the
one
that
would
be
presented
if
parke
and
davis
in
the
antitrust
case
or
a
person
indicted
under
the
dyer
act
or
the
mann
act
raised
objections
to
having
a
municipal
court
judge
to
sit
at
the
trial
of
an
offense
under
one
of
the
general
federal
laws
where
a
quite
plainly
could
not
sit
on
such
an
--
sit
at
the
trial
of
such
an
offense
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
or
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
the
second
question
is
not
properly
here
that
lurk
must
show
that
this
court
was
not
properly
constituted
to
try
him
for
the
offense
of
which
he
was
indicted.
and
the
fact
that
a
day
later,
the
judge
may
be
going
to
sit
in
a
case,
in
which
he
would
not
be
qualified
to
sit,
is
to
put
it
colloquially,
none
of
lurk's
business
and
none
of
the
court's
business
in
deciding
whether
lurk
was
properly
convicted.
and
since,
i
say,
that
congress
could
provide
for
trying
the
crime
of
burglary
before
the
municipal
court.
then
surely
it
can,
so
far
as
lurk
is
concerned,
authorize
his
trial
before
the
district
court
presided
over
by
a
municipal
court
judge.
i
see
no
difference
in
that
respect
between
the
two.
this
leaves,
mr.
chief
justice,
some
questions
on
deciding,
not
only
questions
that
of
course
would
puzzle
you
in
making
assignments,
it
also
leaves,
i
should
make
a
claim
to
the
court
some
questions
undecided
that
will
probably
come
up
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
because
i
am
informed
that
there
are
number
of
cases
backed
up
behind
this
one
which
do
involve
prosecutions
for
federal
offenses.
so
the
ground
of
decision
i'm
suggesting
now
isn't
applicable
to
all
those
cases.
it
won't
solve
all
of
them.
i
was
tempted
to
take
a
broader
ground
but
frankly,
this
is
such
a
complicated
nestle
and
that
it
seem
to
me
that
i
would
do
best
to
try
and
make
up
my
mind
about
one
point
at
a
time
and
maybe
that
would
be
a
wise
way
for
the
court
to
go
about
it,
too.
ultimately,
perhaps
parke
and
davis
antitrust
case
will
be
back
here
because
that's
when
that
judge
jackson
or
at
least
one
of
the
judges
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
said.
the
old
gypsum
case
is
another.
but
i
don't
think
we
have
that
kind
of
problem
before
us.
now,
the
answer
i
suggested,
mr.
justice
black
to
the
chief
justice
a
moment
ago
seems
to
me
to
answer
your
question
if
we
hold
that
local
crimes
in
the
district
of
columbia
can
be
prosecuted
before
a
court
whose
judges
do
not
have
security
of
tenure
and
compensation.
then
why
won't
this
spread
through
the
country?
my
answer
is
that
congress
doesn't
have
the
power
which
it
has
under
article
i
section
8
clause
17
over
the
district
of
columbia
in
relation
to
offenses
in
other
parts
of
the
country.
and
a
fortiori,
something
that
is
a
violation
of
a
local
law
and
a
trial
of
an
alleged
local
offense
need
not
logically
be
spread
elsewhere
in
the
country.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
certainly
a
question
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
can
be
debated
but
i
think
it
would
be
--
i
think
there
are
answers
that
can
be
drawn.
the
best
answer,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
from
--
in
my
judgment
is
that
there's
150
years
of
history
behind
it.
and
i
can
also
work
out
intellectual
answers
dealing
with
this
point.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
it's
--
what
--
no
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
in
the
answer
to
that
--
or
even
if
i
did,
it
would
be
irrelevant.
i
pass
on
now
to
a
second
ground
of
decision
which
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
can
be
put
on
again
without
facing
the
very
broad
constitutional
issue.
we
submit
the
petitioner's
challenge
to
the
right
of
judge
jackson
to
preside
at
his
trial,
came
too
late.
this
point
is
not
raised
until
the
case
was
on
appeal
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
we
submit
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
petitioner
cannot
be
heard
or
raised
but
here.
in
our
brief,
we
have
argued
at
some
length
that
judge
jackson
was
a
de
facto
judge.
and
that
under
the
doctrine
applicable
to
de
facto
officers,
his
right
to
occupy
the
office
could
only
be
challenged
directly
by
quo
warranto.
i
do
not
intend
to
spend
time
developing
that
further
in
my
early
argument.
for
the
sake
of
the
point
that
i
seek
to
make
now,
i
assume
that
a
challenge
to
the
composition
of
the
court
can
be
raised
by
a
litigant
provided
that
it
is
raised
at
timely
fashion.
when
he
learns
the
fact
as
an
opportunity
to
voice
his
objection,
then
he
may
do
it,
i
assume
for
the
moment.
but
we
submit
that
when
he
does
not
voice
his
objection
at
that
time
when
he
sits
quiet
or
waits
to
see
the
outcome,
then
if
he
loses
says,
“oh,
i
have
an
objection!”
that
i
could've
raised
earlier
but
didn't
that
the
answer
is,
you're
too
late
certainly
where
he's
been
represented
by
a
counsel
and
all
the
knowledge
was
available
to
it.
the
answer
that
petitioner
gives
to
that
argument
is
that
questions
relating
to
jurisdiction
can
be
raised
at
any
time.
and
i
submit
that
that
doctrine
is
not
applicable
here.
this
case
was
clearly
being
heard
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
glidden
case,
if
i
may
anticipate
just
a
moment,
the
second
circuit
case
involving
judge
madden
from
the
court
of
claims,
was
unquestionably
being
heard
in
this
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
at
most,
those
courts
had
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
this
was
the
kind
of
case
they
were
authorized
to
deal
with.
the
objection
here
is
not
one
to
lack
of
jurisdiction
to
the
subject
matter
but
rather
to
the
composition
of
the
court.
now,
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
discover,
there
is
no
federal
president
which
holds
that
a
party
before
a
court
which
does
have
jurisdiction
to
the
subject
matter
and
knows
all
the
relevant
fact
could
sit
back
and
wait
the
outcome,
and
then
if
it
is
unfavorable
say,
“oh,
but
that
court
wasn't
properly
--
the
judge
didn't
belong
there”,
that
court
wasn't
properly
composed.
all
the
other
cases
in
this
court,
and
there
are
about
four
of
them,
are
cases
in
which
the
objection
was
raised
at
the
first
possible
opportunity.
in
several,
the
first
possible
opportunity
was
on
appeal
because
you
couldn't
know
who
had
taken
part
or
haven't
taken
part
of
the
decision
below
until
it
had
been
made.
but
the
objection
was
raised
in
all
the
cases
at
the
first
possible
opportunity.
assuming
that
the
question
is
an
open
one,
because
i
think
it
is.
then
we
say
that
all
the
reasons
of
policy
in
good
sense,
the
command
that
there
must
be
an
end
to
litigation,
argue
for
a
holding
that
one
who
knows
the
fact
cannot
sit
back
and
raise
his
argument
if
he
loses
but
take
advantage
of
a
favorable
decision
if
he
win.
this,
i
think,
is
the
real
ground
of
decision
although
not
exactly
as
it
was
put
in
the
opinion
in
mcdowell
against
the
united
states,
the
only
case
that
i
recall,
dealing
with
the
assignment
of
a
judge
from
one
court
to
sit
in
another.
in
that
case,
the
objection
was
not
raised
until
after
there
had
been
an
unfavorable
verdict
and
there
was
a
motion
made
in
arrest
of
judgment
and
the
court
held
that
the
moving
party
had
no
standing
to
challenge
of
the
right
of
the
assigned
judge
to
sit
in
the
court
to
question.
the
language
was
in
terms
of
the
de
facto
doctrine
which
goes
broader
than
anything
that
i'm
presenting
here
this
afternoon.
but
the
result,
it
seems
to
me
quite
rightly,
consistent
with
what
we
advocate.
the
consequences
of
any
other
view
are
--
are
quite
appalling
and
while
of
course
we
should
have
to
face
them
if
the
decision
should
be
that
this
can
be
raised
at
any
time.
assuming
that
there
is
a
certain
latitude
on
the
authorities,
i
think
the
consequences
are
properly
taken
into
account.
judge
jackson,
i
am
told,
has
been
set
for
more
than
five
years
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
virtually
fulltime.
judge
madden
sat
for
at
least
a
week
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
judges
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
have
been
sitting
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
since
1922
with
some
frequency
both
in
the
lower
--
in
the
district
court
or
supreme
court
as
it
was
for
a
time
and
later
in
the
court
of
appeals.
there
are
now
about
nine
cases
of
direct
attack
where
the
point
was
raised
on
appeal
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
if
this
--
if
one
is
to
be
held
entitled
to
raise
this
on
appeal
for
knowing
the
facts
he
failed
to
raise
it
below,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
necessarily
would
follow,
but
he
was
entitled
to
raise
it
by
collateral
attack
either
by
habeas
corpus
or
in
this
big
antitrust
cases
by
some
direct
motion
attacking
the
judgment
is
void
or
some
--
disregarding
the
judgment
is
void
and
then
when
it
was
used,
citations
for
contempt
to
attack
it's
validity.
and
this
would
mean
that
all
these
cases
would
be
thrown
in
doubt,
would
have
to
comeback
to
the
courts
again.
as
i
say,
i
don't
want
to
make
an
in
terrorem
argument.
this
implies
that
and
that
implies
something
else.
but
i
do
think
that
where
the
authorities
are
in
their
present
condition,
these
consequences
of
letting
parties
sit
back
and
not
raise
a
very
elegant
question
like
this
one
would
be
quite
intolerable
and
that
that
is
a
proper
judicial
consideration.
there
is
one
other
point,
if
the
court
please,
which
again
does
not
go
the
whole
way
to
the
constitutional
characterization
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
although
it
brushes
up
against
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
you
--
there
is
this
difference
and
that
is
that
in
the
next
case,
unless
you
would
face
the
merits,
you
would
have
to
go
on
the
second
ground
that
i
have
suggested
rather
than
the
first.
it
can't
be
put
on
the
district
of
columbia
ground.
apart
from
that,
i
think
that
it
would
make
a
--
a
starting
point
in
--
clarifying
the
law
to
face
this
question
on
the
first
ground
--
face
this
case
on
the
first
ground
that
i
argued.
and
this
--
that
would
put
an
end
to
all
these
questions
here
in
the
district.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
leave
the
chief
justice
out
on
a
limb.
perhaps,
the
limb
is
strengthened
a
little
by
the
recent
departments
of
judicial
--
of
additional
judges
so
that
the
situation
that
he
is
confronted
with
may
not
be
much
oppressive.
it
would
leave
him
with
the
embarrassing
choice,
if
there
was
a
court
where
the
only
judge
available
for
assignment
was
a
judge
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
it
would
leave
him
having
to
decide,
it's
better
to
get
the
business
cleared
up
maybe
because
maybe
it
won't
clear
it
up
at
all
or
is
it
better
to
let
the
business
leg
and
not
create
possible
future
litigation.
i
appreciate
that
problem,
my
answer
comes
back
to
the
observation
i
made
earlier
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
this
is
such
a
tangle
that
if
we
try
to
clear
up
too
many
questions,
i
fear
that
it
will
just
be
made
worse
at
least
that
may
only
be
the
limitations
of
my
own
thinking,
but
i
find
this
horrible
thinking
if
one
gets
into
all
the
possible
questions.
mr.
archibald
cox
i've
seen
no
--
no
difficulty
in
his
making
such
an
assignment
as
that.
i
think
it
--
it
would
--
it
would
require
interpretation
of
that
statute.
but
it
would
seem
to
me
the
fair
meaning
of
the
statute
was
that
the
chief
justice
was
given
not
only
the
broad
power
but
if
he
had
doubts
about
the
constitutional
validity
of
that
to
exercise
a
segment
of
the
broad
power
included
within.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
not.
mr.
archibald
cox
let
me
--
mr.
archibald
cox
to
make
my
thinking
clear.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
let's
suppose
that
we
had
a
decision
in
this
case,
saying
that
a
citizen,
resident
of
the
district
of
columbia,
does
not
have
the
right
to
be
tried
for
a
local
offense
before
a
judge
having
security
of
tenure
and
compensation.
and
let
us
have
fur
--
let
us
assume
further
that
we
had
a
decision
which
we
don't
have
yet,
but
let's
assume
that
we
did
saying
that
general
--
crimes
under
the
general
federal
statutes
and
cases
--
civil
cases
of
that
kind,
cannot
be
presided
over
by
a
judge
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeal.
then,
i
am
for
--
then
i
should
think
one
has
to
say
when
i
--
when
congress
pass
this
statute,
did
it
intend
to
be
an
all
or
nothing
proposition?
and
since
it
can't
be
all,
does
that
mean
it
must
be
nothing?
i
would
say
no.
i
would
say
that
this
was
a
statute
which
permitted
separation
that
the
overwriting
intent
is
to
give
the
chief
justice
as
much
power
as
congress
could
to
get
the
judicial
business
of
a
country
done
and
that
giving
effect
to
that
overwriting
interpretation,
one
could
exercise
the
invalid
part.
and
i
would
think
the
same
excision
was
permissible
where
the
chief
justice
was
bothered
by
a
genuine
constitutional
doubt.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
we
pass
the
decision
that
i
stated
--
the
two
decisions
i
stated,
he
wouldn't
have
the
latter
right
--
he
couldn't
have.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
--
just
one
more
sentence
on
that
point
to
which
--
by
way
of
analogy,
if
a
principle
gives
me
a
bundle
of
power
as
--
as
an
agent,
i
don't
have
to
exercise
them
all.
i
may
exercise
some
part
of
it.
and
i
would
say
that
the
chief
justice
here
was
in
that
relation
to
--
to
the
congress
under
the
statute.
there's
a
third
point
which
still
does
not
require
the
position
of
the
broadest
constitutional
question
and
that
is
that
even
if
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
is
not
a
constitutional
court
of
whatever
that
may
mean,
that
a
court
which
may
exercise
what
mr.
gressman
calls
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states,
still,
judge
jackson
had
all
the
qualifications
necessary
to
sit
in
an
article
iii
court.
well,
i
cannot
say
that
this
is
clear
on
the
face
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
it
does
very
strongly
suggest
to
me
that
the
reasoning
of
that
court
run
like
this,
and
i
submit
it
to
this
court
as
sound,
that
judge
jackson
was
appointed
to
exercise
two
functions
to
sit
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
to
sit
in
the
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia.
he
was
appointed
for
life,
given
security
of
compensation
and
confirmed
as
a
judge
exercising
either
one
of
those
powers
that
this
was
enough
to
make
him
an
article
iii
judge.
that
even
if
a
judge
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
absently
assigned
that
statute,
it
wouldn't
have
gotten
security
in
this
respect
since
the
appointment
was
made
in
relation
to
the
assignment
statute
that
judge
jackson
did
get.
now,
certainly
this
doesn't
defeat
any
intention
of
either
the
congress
or
the
president
into
the
senate,
i
should
say,
or
the
president
because
they
confirmed
him,
because
they
appointed
him
for
life
with
security
of
tenure.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
that's
what
it
comes
to.
now
the
only
--
the
only
objection
that
could
possibly
be
raised
to
that
if
he
had
been
appointed
with
a
view
to
assignments
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
would
have
been
well
he
was
appointed
to
--
also
performed
non-judicial
duties
and
you
can't
have
that.
but,
under
the
--
under
the
o'donoghue
case,
you
can
have
that
in
relation
to
the
district
of
columbia.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
he
had
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
1922
statute
applied
only
to
the
district.
i
just
want
to
emphasize
that
this
doesn't
require
going
the
whole
step
to
other
courts.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
reads
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
--
yes,
yes.
and
you
will
recall
that
the
original
judiciary
act
didn't
fix
any
tenure
just
as
the
act
under
which
--
as
the
original
act
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
didn't
fix
any
tenure.
it
just
assumed
the
constitutional
government.
that
was
changed
in
relation
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
before
judge
jackson's
appointment
following
the
decision
of
the
bakelite
case.
but
the
statute
did
give
him
a
tenure
for
life
so
that
the
result
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
commission
is
printed
in
the
front
of
petitioner's
brief
at
page
10,
justice
brennan,
page
10.
mr.
archibald
cox
petitioner's
brief,
the
blue
--
the
thicker
blue
brief.
now
even
if
this
argument
does
not
establish
judge
jackson's
article
i
status
as
of
the
time
he
was
appointed,
surely,
he
acquired
that
status
after
the
legislation
of
1958
because
the
only
thing
possibly
lacking
in
it
earlier
was
that
the
congress
--
that
congress
may
have
had
some
power
to
modify,
overturn
the
action
of
previous
congress.
but
in
1958,
when
the
congress
declared
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
was
a
constitutional
court,
surely,
it
surrendered
what
power
it
could
possibly
have
had
left.
and
since
it
was
the
only
agency
that
possibly
did
have
any
power
left
at
that
stage,
it
surrender
of
it
would
seem
to
be
complete.
and
we
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no
--
no.
no,
i
think
that
before
1958,
judge
jackson
had
all
the
qualities
of
a
--
required
for
a
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
including
security
of
tenure
and
compensation.
i
dislike
so
far
as
we
can
speaking
of
constitutional
court
or
legislative
court
because
frankly,
i
don't
know
what
it
means
or
what
anybody
else
means
it
means
that
it's
--
there
are
times
when
one
falls
into
it
would
it
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
very
difficult
phrase.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
were
--
there
were
two
threads
that
run
through
the
debate.
the
dominant
one
was
the
desire
--
this
came
up
at
the
time
when
there
was
pressure
for
new
judges.
and
congress
said,
“well,
we
will
make
it
possible
for
the
chief
justice
to
have
greater
freedom
in
assigning
judges.
and
we'll
enable
judges
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
to
be
assigned
anywhere
in
the
country
instead
of
confining
them
to
the
district
of
columbia
which
was
a
regular
thing.”
that,
i
think,
it
is
fair
to
say
was
the
dominant
theme
of
the
debate.
there
was
also
an
interest
in
having
the
court
made
a
constitutional
court.
the
court
of
claims
had
been
made
a
constitutional
court
overruling
so
far
as
congress
could
do
it
putting
pressure
to
overturn
the
williams
case
and
there
was
an
interest
in
having
a
light
constitutional
status
given
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
but
it
quite
clearly
was
related
to
the
problem
of
assignment
as
well
as
to
this
other
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
it
would
but
i
would
find
out
that
i
don't
have
to
go
and
haven't
gone
that
far
because
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it's
obvious
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
glad
to
do
that
but
i
do
want
to
keep
this
case
simple.
mr.
archibald
cox
at
least
it
may
be
decided.
mr.
archibald
cox
our
argument
does
take
the
next
step,
your
honor,
and
says
that
yes,
if
there
were
no
other
impediments
and
i
understand
you
to
be
assuming
no
other
impediment.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
congress
could
make
the
retired
--
of
course
these
judges,
none
of
them
were
originally
appointed
for
life
at
all.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
they
have
only
a
term
for
years.
and
our
argument
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
assert
people
who
were
originally
given
a
term
for
years
could
by
an
act
of
congress
be
converted
into
general
judges
with
all
the
attributes
of
an
article
iii
judge.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
should
--
mr.
archibald
cox
then
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
it'd
slipped
to
my
mind
for
a
moment
that
these
were
judges
who've
been
named
only
for
terms.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
my
first
answer
was
quite
wrong.
if
the
court
finds
that
it
must
go
further
and
decide
the
status
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
then
we
do
submit
that
it
is
a
court
created
under
article
iii
and
article
i
section
8
that
therefore
congress
did
have
the
constitutional
power
to
authorize
the
assignment
of
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
judges
to
other
article
iii
courts.
i
recognized
that
this
involves
asking
the
court
to
overrule
the
bakelite
case
and
the
williams
case.it
seems
to
us
that
we're
wired
in
making
that
request
for
several
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
the
course
of
decisions
of
this
court
on
this
question
has
certainly
been
far
from
uniform.
it's
only
with
very
great
difficulty
that
the
o'donoghue
case
can't
be
squared
with
the
bakelite
case
and
still
greater
difficulty
that
it
could
be
squared
with
the
williams
case.
the
williams
case
itself
overturned
a
long
series
of
considered
expression
by
this
court
saying
that
the
court
of
claims
was
a
constitutional
court.
so
that
i
think
this
is
peculiarly
a
situation
where
the
state
of
the
decision
would
justify
reexamination
without
any
weakening
of
whatever
it's
the
normal
doctrine
of
stare
decisis.
second,
it
is
surely
of
someway
in
deciding
whether
a
court
--
whether
the
court
should
reexamine
a
president
that
the
congress
has
both
in
1953
and
in
1958
expressed
it's
disapproval
of
those
decisions.
and
it's
desire
if
it
could
to
do
everything
possible
to
change
these
courts
if
the
change
was
required
in
the
constitutional
courts
and
to
urge
this
court
to
reconsider
the
doctrine
from
the
beginning.
and
while
of
course
that's
not
binding
and
this
is
a
constitutional
question
where
there
would
be
little
occasions
to
have
deferred
the
congress,
nevertheless,
it's
a
reason
for
being
willing
to
reconsider
it,
i
think,
in
additional
reasons.
now,
i
think
that
in
deciding
whether
the
court
of
customs
and
pa
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
had
your
honor's
statement
in
the
tidewater
insurance
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
think
because
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
i
think
because
--
maybe
it
will
still
meet
with
the
majority
favor
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
either
suspects
what
i
have
in
mind
and
i
take
it
your
honor
had
in
mind
was
that
this
is
a
special
kind
of
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
of
course
from
my
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
from
my
standpoint
in
this
case
and
the
more
weight
that
the
court
is
willing
to
give
to
its
depth.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
a
general
question,
i
think
i
would
urge
to
your
honor
that
in
--
intellectual
conversation
that
a
--
even
when
the
matter
has
been
considered,
the
problem
dealing
with
the
judiciary
and
with
--
just
what
are
the
implications
of
article
iii
that
the
congressional
judgment
perhaps
deserves
somewhat
less
weight
than
in
dealing
with
labor
legislation
or
minimum
wages.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
would
certainly
urge
that
and
i
think
that
the
distinction
that
i
failed
to
note
is
--
is
well
taken.
in
deciding
whether
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
is
a
constitutional
court,
it
seems
to
me
wise
to
stay
away
so
far
as
we
can
from
these
abstract,
indeed,
rather
esoteric
question
such
as
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
of
states,
the
non-delegable
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
constitutional
court
and
the
like.
i
suggest
that
having
in
mind
the
words
and
the
purposes
of
article
iii
that
we
should
seek
to
judge
the
character
of
this
court
by
looking
at
four
things.
first,
what's
the
court's
function?
what
is
the
subject
matter
with
which
it
deals?
second,
what
are
the
powers,
and
i
mean
external
power
not
some
inherent
reality
that
you
can't
see,
but
what
can
it
reach
out
and
take
hold
of?
who
can
it
put
in
jail?
who
can
it
subpoena
as
witnesses
of
the
like?
third,
the
qualities
of
its
judgments
especially
in
their
finality,
are
they
binding?
are
they
subject
to
review
by
the
executive
branch
or
by
someone
else
and
fourth,
the
tenure
and
compensation
of
the
judges?
judged
by
those
standards,
we
submit
that
both
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
in
the
next
case,
the
court
of
claims
are
courts
out
of
power
with
such
inferior
courts
as
the
district
courts
and
circuit
courts
of
appeals
and
in
that
sense,
but
i
will
call
roughly
article
iii
courts,
having
nothing
than
a
loose
descriptive
meaning
in
mind.
let
me
look
--
ask
you
to
look
first
of
the
situation
as
it
was
shortly
after
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
was
created
in
1909.
the
subject
matter
with
which
it
was
created
to
deal
was
--
were
--
was
cases
which
theretofore
had
been
heard
in
these
old
circuit
courts
of
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
it
took
over
a
function
which
had
been
performed
by
some
of
the
courts
created
by
congress
as
inferior
courts
of
the
united
states.
these
were
cases
dealing
with
the
classification
of
articles
for
the
purposes
of
the
tariff
law
and
determinations
as
to
what
was
the
rate
of
duty
do.
and
they
were
cases
which
have
been
reviewed
on
a
case
within
this
court
by
one
--
by
certiorari.
they
were
clearly
cases
of
controversies.
it
seems
to
me
undebatable
that
they
arose
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
and
i
would
submit
the
williams
case
to
contrary
not
withstanding
that
they
were
controversies
to
which
the
united
states
was
a
party.
certainly,
it
was
one
of
the
parties
in
interest
and
the
other
party,
of
course,
was
to
first
see
important.
but
in
any
event,
even
if
they're
not
controversies
to
which
the
united
states
was
a
party,
they
did
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
therefore
came
under
their
head
of
article
iii
jurisdiction.
looking
at
the
second
standards,
the
powers
of
this
court
in
deciding
cases,
there
is
no
explicit
specification
of
what
its
power
should
be
in
the
statute.
but
you
will
find
it
in
our
brief
that
the
words
of
the
statute
creating
the
court
were
borrowed
from
the
legislation
creating
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal.
it
follows
almost
word
for
word.
and
there's
every
implication
therefore
that
this
court
was
to
be
organized
in
and
have
the
same
powers
as
those
courts.
indeed,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
is
a
court
of
the
united
states
under
section
453
of
title
28.
and
it
therefore
has
the
powers
conferred
upon
the
courts
of
the
united
states
in
the
other
parts
of
the
judicial
code
including
the
powers
to
issue
subpoenas
and
directly
to
punish
itself
and
to
punish
people
for
it
for
contempt
instead
of
having
to
refer
them
to
some
other
tribunal
as
an
administrative
agency
and
presumably
the
tax
court
would
have
to
do.
so
the
judge
by
the
second
standard,
surely,
this
function
in
the
manner
and
exerted
the
external
powers
of
a
court.
third,
there's
no
question
between
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
after
its
creation
had
all
the
qualities
of
the
judgments
of
other
courts.
indeed,
they
had
sufficient
finality
so
that
in
this
class
of
cases,
this
court
has
reviewed.
fourth,
the
judges
certainly
ostensibly
had
full
security
of
tenure
and
compensation.
the
language
of
the
original
act
with
respect
to
their
term
was
just
like
the
language
of
the
original
judiciary
act.
the
assumption
throughout
the
debate
in
congress
as
our
brief
shows
was
that
they
would
have
both
security
of
tenure
and
compensation.
and
their
appointments,
read
in
the
manner
in
which
all
normal
judges
are
appointed.
it
is
true
that
following
the
bakelite
case,
the
congress
did
pass
a
statute
saying
that
the
term
of
judges
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
should
be
during
good
behavior.
this,
i
take
it,
was
a
situation
forced
upon
the
congress
and
does
not
show
any
departure
from
its
original
intention
under
the
1909
act,
indeed
it
would
tend
to
confirm
it.
and
whatever
its
intention
was
in
1930,
if
i
may
jump
ahead,
its
intention
under
the
1958
legislation
is
perfectly
plain.
indeed,
the
--
the
salary
of
these
judges
from
the
beginning
was
the
same
as
that
of
an
ordinary
circuit
judge.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
two
arguments
that
are
made
by
mr.
gressman
against
the
conclusion
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
as
first
setup
was
what
he
calls
a
constitutional
court.
first,
he
says
in
his
brief,
although
i
thought
he
sort
of
strayed
from
the
line
a
little
in
oral
argument
when
pressed
that
this
is
not
a
constitutional
court
because
it's
specialized.
it
doesn't
deal
with
a
wide
range
of
cases
and
controversies
but
with
a
specific
kind
of
cases
and
controversies.
i
submit
that
that
proposition
is
untenable
on
its
face
of
the
emergency
court
of
appeals
was
a
specialized
court.
the
commerce
court
was
a
specialized
court.
as
justice
frankfurter
suggested
during
the
oral
argument,
it's
always
been
assumed
that
an
article
iii
court,
courts
that
his
judges
had
security
of
tenure
and
compensation
could
be
created
to
hear
public
cases.
and
in
recent
years
of
course,
there
has
been
much
discussion
about
setting
up
an
article
iii
court
to
hear
labor
cases
or
to
hear
administrative
cases
on
the
notion
that
specialization
deprived
the
court
i've
just
stated
is
contrary
to
the
assumption
of
the
bar
and
of
this
court
and
others
i
think
at
this
point.
there
is
another
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
there
is
nothing
which
this
court
does
which
is
inherently
or
necessarily
requires
judicial
determination.
and
this
is
a
phrase
drawn
from
the
bakelite
opinion.
i
confess
that
i
find
in
article
iii
nothing
that
suggests
any
foundation
for
that
language.
and
furthermore,
i
think
that
it
is
an
exceedingly
unfortunate
as
what
we
would
mean
by
which
inherently
are
necessarily
requires
judicial
determination.
this
would
mean
that
to
determine
whether
a
judge
has
life
tenure,
he
would
have
to
run
through
all
the
business
that
his
court
is
--
and
--
is
authorized
to
hear
and
decide
whether
any
of
it
necessarily
requires
judicial
determination.
now
this
isn't
a
clear
question
at
all
in
the
light
of
decision
and
history
over
the
past
30
years.
it's
been
a
good
deal
of
shifting
back
and
forth
between
what
maybe
submitted
to
the
executive
or
an
administrative
tribunal
and
what
requires
judicial
determination.
the
--
so
that
i
suggest
that
as
it
was
constituted,
there
could
be
very
little
question.
but
that
the
judges
of
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
had
all
the
qualities
which
go
with
the
judge
appointed
to
one
of
our
regular
courts
under
article
iii.
then
when
it
comes
to
the
question,
whether
the
additional
jurisdiction
that
was
vested
in
that
court
in
1925
by
the
trier
of
fact
of
that
year
and
again
in
about
1930
when
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
over
cases
from
the
patent
office
was
transferred
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
destroyed
its
character.
let
me
speak
first
into
patent
jurisdiction.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
this
--
that
this
jurisdiction
is
in
truth
a
judicial
power.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
in
this
respect,
i
think
that
there
is
in
truth
none.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
seems
to
me
proposed
in
postum
cereal
case
is
wrong
--
wrongly
decided.
and
we
have
elaborated
the
reason
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
simply
to
mention
one
point
because
i
have
trespassed
on
the
court's
time
enough
already.
if
you
will
note
particularly
the
case
of
hoover
company
against
coe
dealing
with
the
traditional
bill
in
equity
to
review
patent
office
decision,
you
will
find
that
essentially
the
same
kind
of
case
as
the
appeal
jurisdiction
has
been
dealt
with
the
--
with
by
the
district
court
and
by
this
court
for
many
years.
so
that
on
this
point,
we
think
there
really
is
no
problem
at
all.
this
leaves
the
little
fringe
power
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
to
decide
whether
there
has
been
an
unfair
method
of
competition
in
the
--
by
importers
of
goods.
and
it
does
have
a
power
to
review
the
decisions
of
the
tariff
commission
in
that
respect,
the
decision
of
the
tariff
commission
then
goes
to
the
president.
and
the
president
has
the
authority
to
determine
whether
to
put
a
heavier
duty
on
these
articles
or
whether
to
exclude
them
from
importation.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
on
that
--
on
that,
i
would
make
--
i
agree
if
i
would
go
on
and
--
and
make
two
comments.
first,
i
think
i
should
say,
although
it
--
there's
only
been
five
instances
of
this
throughout
the
history
of
this
power.
second,
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
for
reasons
which
i
don't
have
time
to
elaborate,
said
that
the
president
didn't
have
authority
to
disregard
the
decision
upon
this
question,
which
is
a
type
of
question
which
of
course
this
court
and
courts
of
appeals
decide
on
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
what
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
and
one,
i
was
going
to
make
that,
and
one
other
sentence
just
to
suggest
the
point,
i
think
really,
it
doesn't
differ
either
justice
frankfurter
from
the
power
that
this
court
and
the
number
of
other
courts
exercise
when
they
say
to
the
secretary
of
state,
for
example,
you
may
not
deny
a
man
a
passport
on
this
ground.
it's
a
question
whether
later
he
will
get
a
passport
or
whether
they
say
to
the
labor
board,
you
may
not
exclude
a
union
from
filing
in
charge
of
unfair
labor
practices
upon
this
ground.
i
think
our
notions
of
finality
in
relation
to
the
administrative
procedure
have
developed
and
that
this,
too,
would
require
some
reexamination
of
some
of
the
assumptions
of
the
bakelite
case.
for
any
of
these
reasons,
we
think
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
sought
and
was
granted
leave
to
intervene
in
this
case
because
it
drew
and
question
the
--
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress.
in
this
instance,
the
act
of
congress
authorizing
the
chief
justice
to
assign
judges
to
the
court
of
claims
to
sit
in
other
courts.
and
of
course,
it
was
under
that
statute
that
judge
madden
was
assigned
to
the
second
circuit.
i
intend
to
direct
the
bulk
of
my
argument
to
the
constitutional
question
with
which
we're
directly
concerned
here.
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
in
our
view,
this
case
like
the
lurk
case
argued
last
wednesday,
can
and
should
be
decided
upon
the
ground
that
this
issue
concerning
the
qualifications
of
a
particular
judge
to
sit
in
the
court,
is
an
issue
which
can
and
was
waived
by
the
failure
to
raise
it
in
the
court
below.
and
we
think
it's
therefore
unnecessary
and
would
indeed
be
wise
not
to
embark
into
this
constitutional
thinking,
if
i
may
call
it,
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
--
it
leaves
that
question
unresolved.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
no
doubt
about
--
there
was
no
doubt
about
that.
well,
i
simply
think
that
a
--
of
the
--
the
general
failing
that
your
honor
expressed
i
think,
where
one
has
a
series
of
cases
that
there's
uncertainty
about
them,
where
the
problem
in
terms
of
our
history,
as
well
as
the
analysis
as
a
confused
and
confusing
one
that
it
is
wise
to
decide
as
little
as
one
can
at
a
time.
that's
the
only
--
i've
no
particularsm
that
it's
conceivable
that
in
view
of
the
administrative
problems
that
that
general
admonition
is
applicable.
i
have
a
sense
that
it
--
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
particularly
pertinent
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
have
prepared
to
go
on
and
argue
the
question
and
give
the
court
such
assistance
as
i
can
on
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
like
to
develop
in
the
half
hour
available
to
me
four
points.
first,
i
shall
argue
to
the
court
and
i
think
they're
really
can
be
very
little
dispute
about
this.
the
judge
by
the
character
of
its
business
by
its
organization
has
the
powers
that
it
exercises,
by
the
quality
including
the
finality
of
its
judgments,
and
by
the
security
of
tenure
and
compensation
that
the
congress
sought
to
give
the
judges.
the
court
of
claims
is
like
our
normal
article
iii
courts.
second,
i
shall
point
out
that
congress
has
from
at
least
1863
forward
and
we
think
from
the
beginning,
intended
to
establish
the
court
as
an
art
--
court
of
claims
as
an
article
iii
court.
then
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
--
what
we
deem
to
be
the
faults
and
the
reasoning
in
the
williams
case.
and
finally
to
discuss
the
congressional
reference
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims,
under
which
it
does
occasionally,
not
more
than
once
a
year
on
the
average
render
reports
to
the
congress
of
which
are
not
strict
in
judge
--
judgments
and
which
therefore
does
bear
upon
its
standing
in
the
constitutional
separation
of
powers.
may
i
first
say
just
one
word
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims,
it
is
conferred
jurisdiction
under
the
statute
to
hear
claims
against
the
united
states
founded
upon
the
constitution,
upon
any
statute,
upon
a
regulation
of
an
executive
department,
or
upon
a
contract
expressed
or
implied.
that
is
the
great
bulk
of
the
court
of
claims'
jurisdiction.
it
also
has
a
certain
appellate
power
in
tort
cases
against
the
united
states
under
the
tort
claims
act.
the
parties
may
by
agreement
go
to
the
court
of
claims
from
the
district
court,
instead
of
going
to
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
know
of
no
instance
in
which
it
happened
but
i
didn't
make
a
thorough
study.
it
requires
consent
of
both
parties
and
it
seems
to
me
rather
unlikely
that
would
happen.
but
i
thought
perhaps
it
should
be
useful
to
have
described
what
kind
of
cases
the
court
may
get.
it
may,
of
course,
hear
tax
cases
and
does
hear
tax
cases
seeking
a
refund
under
the
first
general
head
of
jurisdiction.
it
hears
cases
from
the
indian
claims
commission.
and
it
does
have
today
this
congressional
reference
jurisdiction.
it's
only
the
old
executive
reference,
as
been
abolished
by
statute
but
the
congress
does
very
occasionally
ask
the
court
of
claims
to
report
the
facts
in
a
situation
where
it
does
not
grant
judgment.
and
i'm
going
to
deal
with
that
at
the
end
of
my
argument
even
though
it
does
seem
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
very
essential
considerations.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
to
--
as
to
some
of
them,
i
think,
there's
a
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
authority
of
the
indian
claims
commissions
to
make
the
words
to
the
indians,
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
think
i'm
right
with
that.
i'd
--
i
don't
want
to
go
too
far
in
assuring
the
court
of
things
that
i've
--
have
only
a
general
idea
about
it.
as
i
understand
it,
the
indian
claims
commission,
may
make
awards
to
the
indians
on
grounds
that
would
not
be
applicable
in
a
suit
between
your
honor
and
myself
or
other
private
citizen.
and
it
therefore
occurred
to
me
when
the
question
was
asked
earlier
about
setting
up
a
court
to
hear
claims
of
the
indians
that
if
they
--
it
had
the
full
power
that
the
indian
claims
commission
does
but
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
was
not
the
type
of
case
or
controversy
or
the
type
of
judicial
business
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
had
in
mind
when
they
wrote
article
iii.
and
that
therefore,
a
man
appointed
to
sit
whatever
term
he
was
given
by
congress
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
security
that
article
iii
gives
to
a
federal
judge.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
that's
true.
but
it's
my
understanding
is
that
since
the
jurisdiction
of
that
commission
was
increased
and
it
was
brought
in
the
early
1950s,
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
you
--
you've
granted
just
one
since
that
broadening
of
jurisdiction.
and
it
may
be
that
some
questions
will
arise
if
the
cases
that
are
taken
up
are
not
ones
founded
upon
the
narrower
grounds,
i
think
were
applicable
in
all
instances.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
if
it
--
it
involves
a
lot
of
trouble
and
i
was
not
intending
to
go
beyond
saying
at
this
moment
that
some
of
the
business
that
may
come
before
the
indian
claims
commission
is
not
necessarily
judicial
business
judge
by
the
time
--
by
what
was
heard
at
westminster
or
thought
of
his
judicial
business
in
1789.
i
--
i
did
not
intend
to
go
beyond
that
point
at
all
to
reply
anything
further.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
they
--
it
does
have
a
--
it
has
a
broader
power.
and
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
--
has
taken
a
case
involving
a
grant
based
on
the
broader
ground.
i've
--
it
has
taken
at
least
one
case
since
the
jurisdiction
was
brought.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
involved
the
claim
on
the
broader
ground.
and
i
know
we've
had
discussion
in
the
department
as
to
whether
some
of
the
denials
of
certiorari
in
these
cases
might
not
have
been
based
in
part
of
the
theory
that
the
indian
claims
commission
was
no
longer
simply
awarding
judicial
judgment.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
that's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
in
--
that
the
underlying
judgments
may
have
been
based
upon
contract
say,
or
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
something
that
wasn't
simply
generalized
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
yes,
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
for
that
--
that
--
that
still
could
be
based
on
a
judgment
based
on
legal
right
underneath.
mr.
archibald
cox
commission
had
done.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
would
take
us
into
an
area
where
i
--
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
qualified
to
be
much
help
as
to
whether
the
scope
for
the
grounds
of
review
by
the
court
of
claims.
if
they
were
confined
to
questions
of
law
in
the
conventional
sense
then,
of
course,
this
would
be
like
review
of
other
administrative
agency
action.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
guess
that
i
had
a
different
field
in
mind
that
your
honor
does.
i
do
sub
--
submit
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes,
though
there
--
there's
no
--
when
one
is
concerned
with
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
judicial
quality
of
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
not
only
does
it
seem
to
be
to
establish
that,
but
to
establish
two
other
points
which
are
relevant
here.
one
is
that
this
is
not
only
a
case
that
the
court
of
claims'
business.
it's
not
only
concerned
with
cases
or
controversies
but
that
these
are
cases
or
controversies
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party
or
in
the
other
event
which
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
i
think
that
it's
quite
clear
that
they
fall
under
both
heads
of
article
iii
power
and
in
that
respect
that
the
williams
case
was
erroneous.
furthermore,
i
would
emphasize
one
other
thing
about
the
nature
of
the
court
of
claims'
business.
it's
been
suggested
during
the
argument
by
mr.
bordeau
and
by
mr.
gressman
last
week,
that
a
court
cannot
be
an
article
iii
court
unless
it
hears
some
cases
that
must
be
heard
by
courts.
apparently,
they've
conceived
of
two
kinds
of
judicial
power,
one
which
only
article
iii
courts
can
exercise
and
another
which
article
iii
courts
can
but
don't
have
to.
now,
some
of
the
business
of
the
court
of
claims,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
kind
--
involves
the
kind
of
question,
which
this
court
has
held,
must
be
the
subject
of
a
judicial
determination.
i
have
in
mind
particularly
the
cases
where
the
united
states
is
sued
for
a
taking
not
by
eminent
domain
but
simply
by
a
superior
force,
the
standard
oil.
the
early
case
of
the
monongahela
navigation
company,
this
court
said
that
the
determination
of
what
is
just
compensation
is
peculiarly
a
judicial
function
and
must
be
det
--
must
be
made
in
the
last
instance
by
a
court.
so
that
we
think
on
this
account,
the
court
of
claims
clearly
exercises
judicial
power
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
looking
to
see
what
it
does.
it's
also
plain
that
the
court
is
organized
in
the
manner
and
has
the
powers
including
the
contempt
powers
and
subpoena
power
which
go
to
the
court.
and
i
would
emphasize
third
that
its
judgments
every
since
the
act
of
1866
have
been
final
and
binding.
it
is
true
that
the
court
has
no
power
to
levy
execution.
the
payment
depends
of
a
--
upon
congress
passing
in
appropriation.
and
there
is
a
suggestion
in
the
opinion
prepared
by
chief
judge
--
justice
taney
in
the
gordon
case
that
--
that
was
the
--
that
the
lack
of
power
to
levy
execution
was
the
fault
in
the
1863
statute.
indeed,
he
dwelt
on
that
somewhat
more,
i
think,
than
he
did
on
the
power
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
revise.
but
since
the
power
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
revise
was
struck
down,
no
one
has
ever
questioned
of
the
finality
of
the
court
of
claims'
judgment
or
the
justiciability
of
the
cases
that
are
submitted
to
him.
indeed,
each
judgments
are
exactly
like
those
rendered
by
the
district
courts
under
the
tucker
act,
exactly
in
this
respect
like
those
rendered
by
the
district
courts
under
the
tort
claims
act.
and
i
think
our
history
makes
it
plain
that
one
can
have
a
legally
binding
judgment
at
least
against
the
sovereign
without
having
to
have
the
court
have
power
to
levy
execution.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
just
before
the
recess,
i
was
attempting
to
emphasize
the
judicial
functions
perform
by
the
court
of
claims
and
particularly
sought
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
at
least
in
some
instances,
it
seems
to
perform
judicial
duties
which
must
be
performed
by
a
court.
and
i
cited
the
determination
of
just
compensation
in
the
case
of
the
taking
is
in
illustration.
i
would
add
to
that
a
second
category
of
business
which
results
from
the
fact
that
the
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction
not
only
of
suits
against
the
government
but
also
of
not
only
set-offs
but
counterclaims
against
as
those
citizens
or
other
person
who
are
plaintiffs
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
without
attempting
to
particularize,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
could
be
little
doubt
not
only
that
this
is
the
kind
of
business
which
is
the
daily
grist
of
courts
but
that
undoubtedly
some
of
those
counterclaims
would
involve
claims
by
the
united
states
against
the
citizen
which
could
not
be
adjudicated
finally
outside
a
court.
and
we
think
this
emphasizes
again
that
this
court's
business
is
in
truth
the
kind
of
business
which
was
thought
of
as
part
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
of
the
kind
of
business
that
the
court
normally
dealt
with
and
was
equipped
to
deal
with.
hereto,
i
think
when
other
distinction
is
important
and
then
i
plan
to
drop
this
point.
there
was
well
recognized
that
the
time
the
constitution
was
adapted
and
in
the
earlier
english
law
and
later
in
our
law,
a
difference
between
sovereign
immunity
and
the
existence
of
a
legal
cause
of
action,
if
you
will,
against
the
government.
and
what
court
of
claims
has
been
set
up
to
deal
with
is
not
the
distribution
of
large
gist
but
the
adjudication
of
these
causes
of
action
against
the
government
of
the
kind
of
cause
of
action
that
was
well-known
and
could
be
maintained
where
ever
the
sovereign
choose
waive
it's
immunity
not
only
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
but
in
this
cou
--
in
england,
but
in
this
country
about
that
time
and
in
various
types
of
cases
afterwards
that
points
develop
with
a
history
in
our
brief.
and
i
simply
allude
to
adhere
as
further
evidence
that
controversies
to
which
the
united
states
may
be
a
party
as
a
matter
of
recognized
usage
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted
involved
not
only
controversies
in
which
the
united
states
might
be
the
moving
party
but
controversies
in
which
the
united
states
would
be
defendant.
and
in
holding
the
contrary,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
williams
case
is
wrong
not
only
as
a
matter
of
logic
but
also
as
a
matter
of
history.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
sir.
it
does
not.
i
think
not.
i
was
just
coming
to
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
do
--
we
do
make
that
point.
we
do
argue
in
our
brief
and
i
aser
--
submit
here
that
in
the
case
of
special
courts
set
up
that
the
seat
of
the
government
with
a
limited
jurisdiction
that
congress
may
as
held
in
the
o'donoghue
case
call
upon
them
to
perform
non
--
not
strictly
judicial
duties.
i
don't
think
our
case
depends
on
that.
and
i
think
the
court
of
claims
can
be
held
to
be
a
constitutional
court
without
reaching
that
conclusion.
but
the
answer
to
your
honor
is
yes,
we
do
make
that
argument.
may
i
suggest
that,
because
i
was
just
going
to
develop
this
directly,
that
i
try
to
develop
affirmatively
where
we
do
stand
on
this
question.
and
then
if
i
haven't
answered
all
the
questions
to
your
honors'
mind,
i'll
try
to
do
my
best.
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
tribunal
which
is
a
court
like
any
article
iii
court
or
except
in
its
place
in
the
hierarchy
like
this
court
in
respect
to
all
its
business,
in
respect
to
all
its
powers,
in
respect
to
the
tenure
and
compensation
of
its
judges,
in
every
respect
except
for
this
fringe
congressional
reference
jurisdiction.
and
if
it
were
not
for
that,
it
would
seem
to
me
there
was
really
nothing
to
be
arguing
about
here.
the
question
then
becomes
how
does
this
affect
the
case.
well,
i
would
say
first,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
just
as
the
existence
of
this
congressional
reference
jurisdiction
has
never
been
thought
to
prevent
all
the
rest
of
the
court
of
claims
business
from
being
judicial
and
justiciable
and
from
being
cases
and
controversies
such
as
this
court
could
review.
so
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
existence
of
this
fringed
non-judicial
duties
should
not
be
held
to
affect
the
quality
of
the
judges'
tenure
that
they
have
been
set
up
predominantly
for
the
purpose
of
exercising
judicial
power
the
congress
has
sought
in
everyway
that
it
could
to
give
them
constitutional
tenure
because
it
thought
it
was
appropriate
to
the
dispatch
of
the
judicial
business
because,
and
it
mentioned
this
specifically
in
1953.
it
would
make
them
available
for
assignment
to
other
courts
and
finally
because
it
declared
this
was
to
be
a
constitutional
court.
so
i
would
submit
that
even
if
these
other
duties
have
been
given
that
this
should
not
take
away
from
the
judges
their
constitutional
status.
and
i
point
out
that
that
was
the
holding
in
the
o'donoghue
case
although
since
we
are
asking
the
court
to
reexamine
many
authorities
in
this
field.
i
think
the
reexamination
necessarily
involves
the
o'donoghue
case,
too.
now,
i
would
think
that
under
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
my
--
my
argument
up
to
this
point
leaves
hanging
the
question
what
about
this
congressional
reference
function.
and
i
would
say
first
that
i
don't
think
there
is
any
occasion
to
enter
a
part
and
inquiry
into
it,
because
the
--
i
do
think
that
one
could
uphold
the
status
of
the
judges
without
going
into
it.
still,
it
is
here
and
i
ought
to
go
on.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
going
to
answer
justice
stewart's
question.
there
are
three
possible
answers,
it
seems
to
me.
the
first
is
that
being
a
special
tribunal
and
not
like
the
normal
courts
this
district
and
circuit
courts
that
this
fringed
that
the
rule
in
hayburn's
case
does
not
apply
in
this
fringe
jurisdiction
can
be
added.
mr.
archibald
cox
or
because
it
is
a
primarily.
because
it
is
a
special
court
which
doesn't
have
the
general
jurisdiction,
the
adding
of
the
non-judicial
business
therefore
seems
to
me
not
to
involve
all
the
problems
of
overloading
the
court
and
the
risk
of
destroying
its
independence
which
would
be
involved
if
you
are
dealing
with
the
district
court
and
the
courts
of
appeals.
and
this
is
not
after
all
a
rule
hayb
--
hayburn's
case
is
not
a
rule
which
is
written
into
the
constitution.
it's
a
matter
of
preserving
the
independence
of
the
judiciary.
but
i
think
there's
room
for
recognition
of
some
questions
of
degree.
the
--
the
ten
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
just
going
to
say,
the
tenure
part
clearly
is,
and
i
think
a
verification
also
in
the
constitution,
is
that
you
can't
take
all
of
what
was
regarded
as
judicial
business
in
1789
and
give
it
to
people
who
do
not
have
the
tenure.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
--
well,
the
second
possible
conclusion
is
that
the
judges
may
not
be
required
to
do
this
but
just
as
judges
have
from
time
to
time
all
through
history
in
this
country,
voluntarily
taken
on
additional
responsibility.
so
the
judges
of
the
court
of
claims
may
voluntarily
take
on
this
responsibility.
finally,
there
would
be
of
course
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
possible
conclusion
that
this
part
of
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction
must
be
excise.
i
would
make
just
one
point
with
--
with
respect
to
that.
i
think
that
congress
has
attempted
to
make
it
a
constitutional
court.
it
has
also
attempted
to
give
them
this
jurisdiction.
now,
if
you
say
you
can't
have
both,
it
is
quite
clear
to
me
that
the
primary
intention
of
this
difficulty
was
pointed
out
to
the
congress
hypothetically.
the
primary
intention
was
to
make
them
a
constitutional
court.
and
i
would
submit
that
if
the
court
should
feel
that
it
had
to
face
this
question
of
the
congressional
reference
jurisdiction
and
if
it
felt
it
could
not
be
given
even
to
the
specialized
court
and
then
it
should
give
effect
to
the
primary
intention
of
congress
as
it
has
declared
it
and
the
rule
that
the
congressional
reference
jurisdiction
could
not
be
added
to
a
constitutional
court
that
if
congress
wanted
a
tribunal
that
could
do
both,
it
would
have
to
change
its
legislation
around.
but
i
think
really
the
point
which
i
can
see
the
being
most
significant
is
the
one
i
have
made
first
to
with
that
the
--
had
the
--
that
the
status
of
the
judges
who
have
the
judicial
power
to
exercise
is
--
is
clear
and
that
that
is
the
only
question
involved
here
and
that
the
effect
of
this
once
a
year
congressional
reference
shouldn't
alter
their
constitutional
status
or
judge
madden's
power
to
sit
therefore
as
a
constitutional
judge
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
wasn't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
what
i
said
--
what
i
meant
to
say
your
honor
was
that
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
reconsider
anything
in
o'donoghue.
and
i
don't
think
my
argument
requires
me
to.
i
said
i
suggested
that
for
me
simply
to
say
o'donoghue
holds
you
can
add
non-judicial
duties
to
some
article
iii
judges
was
hardly
an
end
of
the
matter
because
i
was
asking
the
court
to
reexamine
two
other
cases
that
hardly
laid
my
mouth
to
say
well,
as
to
that
one,
it's
a
binding
precedent
but
that
was
all
i
was
saying.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
quarrel
with
anything
in
o'donoghue.
