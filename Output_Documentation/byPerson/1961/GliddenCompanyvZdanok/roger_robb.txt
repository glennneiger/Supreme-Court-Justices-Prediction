mr.
roger
robb
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
chief
judge
and
the
associate
judges
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
amici
curiae.
in
the
10
minutes
of
my
disposal,
i
should
like
if
i
may
to
make
or
touch
upon
two
points.
first,
i
should
like
to
examine
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
a
trial
before
an
article
iii
court
for
an
offense
committed
in
the
district
of
columbia.
and
second,
with
deference,
i
should
like
to
examine,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
ex
parte
bakelite.
now
on
the
first
point,
the
petitioner
contends
that
he
had
a
constitutional
right
to
be
tried
before
an
article
iii
court
and
judge
for
an
offense
committed
here
in
washington
in
the
district
of
columbia.
we
submit
that
trial
for
such
an
offense
in
the
district
before
a
purely
legislative
court
would
be
constitutional.
that
is,
we
say
that
no
constitutional
right
of
this
petitioner
was
violated
even
though
judge
jackson
was
not
an
article
iii
judge.
now,
this
court
has
long
recognized
and
the
congress
had
recognized
that
the
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia
perform
a
dual
function,
the
function
of
state
courts
and
the
functions
of
regular
federal
district
courts.
and
pursuant
to
this
doctrine,
congress
has
provided
since
early
days
for
the
trial
of
criminal
cases
arising
in
the
district
of
columbia
before
legislative
courts.
as
early
as
1838,
the
congress
created
in
the
district
what
was
called
a
criminal
court
composed
of
one
judge
who
did
not
have
life
tenure
and
whose
salary
was
less
than
that
of
the
district
judge
and
provided
that
that
judge
would
try
all
criminal
cases
arising
in
the
district
of
columbia,
all
cases
in
which
were
involved
violations
of
any
law
in
the
district
of
columbia.
in
1870,
congress
created
in
the
district
what
was
then
called
the
police
court
which
had
jurisdiction
over
all
misdemeanor
prosecutions
concurrently
with
the
district
court.
and
that
jurisdiction
has
continued
from
that
day
to
this.
the
name
of
the
court
of
course
hadn't
been
changed.
the
court
now
have
been
called
--
haven't
been
changed.
now,
at
present,
such
misdemeanor
is
triable
in
this
non-article
iii
legislative
municipal
court
include
not
only
violations
of
local
statutes
but
violations
of
general
federal
statutes
which
hardly
occur
in
the
district
would
be
tried
before
a
federal
district
court
which
at
least
made
to
suggest,
may
it
please
the
court.
and
perhaps
this
might
have
some
bearing
upon
the
questions
of
the
chief
justice.
that
the
test
of
the
power
of
congress
to
provide
in
the
district
for
the
trial
of
criminal
offenses
and
before
a
non-article
iii
court
is
not
the
section
of
the
statute
which
is
involved
but
rather
the
venue
of
the
offense.
and
if
congress
has
the
right
to
provide
on
the
trial
of
all
offenses
of
which
the
venue
is
in
the
district
of
columbia
before
a
non-article
iii
court.
now,
of
course,
if
the
reasoning
of
the
petitioner
is
sound
and
we
suggest
that
all
prosecutions
of
misdemeanors
in
this
district,
perhaps
since
1870,
had
been
unconstitutional
and
void
and
that
frankly
is
rather
hard
for
me
to
believe.
we
might
know
it
also
that
of
course
a
defendant
worthy
tried
for
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
to
all
the
guarantees
of
the
constitution.
now,
i
might
note
parenthetically
that
the
court
in
his
opinion
in
bakelite
characterized
the
then
supreme
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
as
a
legislative
court.
and
yet
at
that
time,
the
supreme
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
exercised
jurisdiction
over
all
felony
prosecutions
here
on
the
district.
so
i
take
it
mr.
gressman
will
not
go
along
with
that
portion
of
the
bakelite
opinion.now
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
life.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
sir.
now,
coming
to
my
second
point,
as
a
lawyer,
i
have
of
course
an
abiding
faith
that
this
court
is
wiser
than
i
and
certainly
knows
more
law
than
i.
and
therefore,
it
is
with
some
dividends
that
i
suggest
that
a
decision
of
this
court
was
mistaken.
however,
my
duty
to
my
clients
requires
me
to
do
so
in
the
case
of
ex
parte
bakelite.
i
should
like
to
point
out
briefly
the
reasons
why
we
have
raised
that
conclusion.
as
mr.
cox
has
said
in
the
first
place,
the
jurisdiction
invested
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
by
the
tariff
act
of
1909
was
precisely
the
same
jurisdiction
which
part
of
that
time
had
been
invested
in
the
federal
district
courts
or
circuit
courts
which
of
course
were
constitutional
courts.
now,
the
court
in
the
bakelite
case
said
that
courts
established
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution
called
constitutional
courts
share
in
the
exercise
of
judicial
power
defined
in
that
section
and
can
be
invested
with
no
other
jurisdiction.
but
turning
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
customs
appeals,
the
court
found
that
that
jurisdiction
was
advisory
only.
now
my
question
is,
may
it
please
the
court,
if
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
district
courts
was
constant
--
was
that
of
a
constitutional
court
and
those
courts
could
be
invested
with
none
other,
then
i'll
pray
--
i'll
pray
can
we
say
that
such
jurisdiction
was
not
--
not
the
jurisdiction
of
a
constitutional
court
when
it
was
transferred
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
necessary
break
in
logic
in
this
reason.
now,
we
submit
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
circuit
courts
was
plainly
judicial,
an
article
iii
jurisdiction
and
it
--
and
it
did
not
cease
to
be
such
when
transferred
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
now,
we
invite
your
attention
also
to
the
fact
that
the
payne-aldrich
tariff
act
of
1909
provided
that
custom
cases
then
pending
in
the
circuit
courts
might
be
reviewed
on
appeal
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
again,
we
ask,
could
it
be,
could
it
be
that
a
mere
legislative
court
exercising
only
advisory
or
administrative
jurisdiction
could
be
created
by
congress
to
review
the
judgments
of
federal
constitutional
courts.
we
question
also
the
reasoning
of
bakelite
that
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
customs
appeals
were
not
judicial
for
the
reason
that
the
matters
involved
in
appeals
before
that
court
had
been
at
times
confided
to
executive
determination.
we
submit
that
matters
which
might
--
might
be
confided
to
such
determination
may
also
be
the
proper
business
of
constitutional
courts.
and
an
example
of
course,
is
in
cases
arising
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
now
finally,
on
the
subject
of
the
custom
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
we
emphasize,
as
mr.
cox
has
pointed
out,
that
only
a
minute
fraction
of
that
jurisdiction
was
involved
in
the
bakelite
case.
and
that
fraction
was
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
review
on
questions
of
law
proceedings
leading
to
a
recommendation
to
the
president
in
the
matter
of
tariffs.
only
six
such
cases
have
ever
reached
the
court.
and
we
think
--
think
that
this
particular
jurisdiction
which
by
the
way
was
not
conferred
upon
the
court
until
1922,
13
years
after
the
court
--
court
was
started
that
this
particular
jurisdiction,
even
though
it
is
merely
advisory
should
not
taint
the
entire
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
should
not
by
its
coloration,
discolor
the
entire
court.
now,
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i
haven't
quite
finished
my
findings.
mr.
roger
robb
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
in
our
brief,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
point
out
that
since
the
decision
or
after
--
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
postum
cereal
case.
the
statute
was
changed
with
respect
to
patent
appeals
so
that
decisions
on
appeal
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
now
are
final.
but
apparently,
that
change
in
the
statute
was
not
called
to
the
attention
of
this
court
at
the
time
of
the
argument
in
bakelite.
and
we
think
it's
a
very
important
one.
we
have
discussed
these
matters
in
our
brief
at
further
length
and
i
should
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
well
--
mr.
roger
robb
what
i
meant
to
say
mr.
justice
black
was
that
certain
violations
of
general
federal
statues
which
do
constitute
misdemeanors
which
if
they
occur
here
in
the
district
may
be
tried
for
--
before
the
lower
court,
the
statutory
court
whose
judges
do
not
have
life
tenure.
however,
if
those
offenses
occurred
in
a
district,
they
would
necessarily
be
tried
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
roger
robb
any
--
mr.
roger
robb
any
--
mr.
roger
robb
any
murder
case
of
course
would
be
tried
before
our
district
court
here.
mr.
roger
robb
i
don't
think
i
intend
to
say
that,
mr.
justice
black.
of
course
--
of
course
the
procedure
would
be
the
same.
my
only
point
was
that
where
the
venue
of
any
offense
is
--
is
here
in
--
in
washington
d.c.
is
that
offense
is
a
misdemeanor.
the
offender
is
tried
before
to
lower
court.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes.
i
say
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
would
say
mr.
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
black,
that
if
--
that
in
the
case
of
a
murder,
the
congress
if
it
wished
to
do
so
as
it
has
done
in
the
past,
as
it
did
it
--
as
it
did
back
in
1838,
congress
couldn't
provide
that
such
cases
should
be
tried
before
a
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
whose
judges
did
not
have
life
tenure.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
my
point
was
that
since
congress
has
that
power,
this
petitioner
has
no
constitutional
right
to
be
tried
for
robbery
before
a
judge
having
life
tenure
or
before
a
judge
of
a
constitutional
court,
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way.
that
was
my
point.
mr.
roger
robb
that
is
correct.
may
it
please
the
court,
but
i
--
i
think
perhaps
if
i
might
say
so,
the
catch
in
your
honor's
--
in
your
honor's
position
is
--
mr.
roger
robb
oh,
no.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
--
yes
sir.
i
think
perhaps
the
--
the
--
the
point
is
that
i
do
not
believe
it
--
it
is
to
the
constitutional
disadvantage
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
or
would
be.
mr.
roger
robb
that's
been
done
--
mr.
roger
robb
all
i
can
say
is,
your
honor,
that
it
--
it
has
been
done
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
past
by
congress
starting
in
1838.
and
of
course
that
--
that
question
doesn't
necessarily
arise
here
because
we
have
a
judge
who
was
appointed
for
life.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
sir.
so,
i
would
say
that
perhaps
--
perhaps
the
question
isn't
--
isn't
here
in
this
case.
mr.
roger
robb
well
--
mr.
roger
robb
whole?
oh,
no.
mr.
roger
robb
oh,
no,
sir.
oh,
no.
oh,
no,
not
indeed.
no
indeed
sir.
my
point
merely
was
in
the
past
that
was
done.
i
think
that
threw
some
light
upon
the
present
situation.
but
here
in
this
case,
we
do
not
have
a
judge.
we
do
not
have
a
question
of
a
man
being
tried
for
murder
before
a
judge
who
serves
only
for
fix
term
of
years,
which
i
can
see
it
might
make
a
difference.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
no,
sir.
i'm
not
backing
away
from
our
--
mr.
roger
robb
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
roger
robb
that's
correct,
i
do.
mr.
roger
robb
they
did
do
it
in
the
past,
yes.
mr.
roger
robb
but
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
they
could
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
roger
robb
--
and
they
have.
mr.
roger
robb
now,
of
course,
may
it
please
the
court,
if
the
man
were
tried
in
a
state
court
for
murder,
he
would
very
--
and
unusually
is
tried
before
a
judge
who
doesn't
serve
for
life.
mr.
roger
robb
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
robb
oh,
no.
but
congress
at
this
point
--
mr.
roger
robb
as
this
court
has
said,
congress,
may
it
please
the
court,
congress
acts
as
a
state
legislature
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
has
done
so.
mr.
roger
robb
because
this
court
has
so
held.
mr.
roger
robb
because,
may
it
please
the
court,
as
this
court
has
said
emphatically,
the
district
of
columbia
is
subject
to
the
first
10
amendments
of
the
constitution
and
jury
trial
is
guaranteed.
this
court
said
that
specifically
in
the
keller
case,
pointed
that
out
and
although,
for
instance
we
can
--
a
man
may
be
tried
here
for
a
misdemeanor
before
a
judge
who
served
for
only
10
years.
nevertheless,
he
has
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
roger
robb
no
sir,
not
entirely.
no,
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
no,
sir.
i
say
that
where
the
bill
of
rights
specifically
guarantees
a
man
a
right
here,
he
gets
it.
but
when
he
doesn't,
then
that's
the
question.
mr.
roger
robb
well
--
mr.
roger
robb
well,
then
--
then
of
course
the
court
would
say
i
was
wrong.
mr.
roger
robb
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i
would
first
like
to
direct
my
attention
to
a
--
statements
that
have
been
made
with
respect
to
the
timeliness
of
the
raising
of
the
question
as
to
the
capacity
of
judge
madden
to
sit
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
in
the
first
place,
mr.
cox
in
talking
about
the
timeliness
of
raising
this
jurisdictional
question
stated
that
if
it
were
a
matter
of
jurisdiction
relating
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
lawsuit
that
he
agreed,
as
i
recall
his
statement,
that
that
jurisdictional
question
could
be
raised
at
any
time.
i
say
with
equal
emphasis
that
if
there'd
be
a
constitutional
lack
of
capacity
on
the
part
of
judge
madden
to
sit
in
an
article
iii
court
that
that
jurisdictional
objection
may
likewise
be
raised
at
any
time.
now
in
fact,
the
judges
of
the
court
of
claims
when
we
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court,
a
petition
was
also
filed
by
the
judges
of
that
court
as
amici
curiae
in
support
of
the
petition
filed
by
the
petitioner
here.
and
i
would
like
briefly
to
call
to
your
honors
attention
the
statements
contained
on
page
5
of
that
amici
curiae
brief
in
support
of
our
petition.
our
petitioner
apparently
did
not
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals
the
objection
now
made
to
judge
madden's
participation
in
the
hearing
and
decision
of
that
court.
but
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
noted
in
his
dissent
on
other
grounds
in
the
lurk
case,
the
question
raised
by
the
petitioner
is
jurisdictional
in
nature.
such
a
jurisdictional
point
may
be
raised
at
any
time.
see
mcgrath
against
kristensen
which
one
of
the
cases
upon
which
we
rely.
if
judge
madden,
and
i'm
still
quoting
from
this
brief
of
the
judges
of
the
court
of
claims,
if
judge
madden
because
of
constitutional
prohibitions
was
not
competent
to
serve,
as
petitioner
contends,
the
judgment
in
which
he
participated
is
null
and
void.
that
is
the
end
of
my
quote
and
the
cited
number
of
case
upon
which
we
rely
and
support
of
our
position
that
we
may
raised
this
jurisdictional
question
at
any
time
particularly
during
the
course
of
these
proceedings
and
particularly
during
the
pendency
of
it
and
after
this
petition
before
this
court.
and
in
--
thirdly
in
reply
to
that
contention
made
by
the
opposition,
i
would
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
lamar
against
the
united
states
decided
in
1960
where
a
christian
was
presented
to
the
court
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
making
an
assignment
of
one
circuit
judge
to
another
circuit.
the
case
was
tried.
it's
a
criminal
case.
it
was
tried
and
went
on
appeal.
it
came
to
this
court.
and
there
was
a
petition
--
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
i
should
say.
and
i
think
there
were
further
proceedings
taken
in
this
court
and
i
would
like
to
very,
very
briefly
to
note
that
this
court
in
a
unanimous
opinion
held
that
the
question
they
raised
was
properly
and
fully
considered
and
was
passed
upon
by
this
court.
we
submit
that
authority
along
with
the
case
of
donegan
against
dyson
which
i
have
also
quoted
in
my
brief
as
authority
to
the
effect
that
this
court
has
on
numerous
occasions
or
at
least
on
a
number
of
occasions
considered
that
the
making
of
application
upon
the
hearing
of
a
petition
in
this
court
was
timely.
at
least,
no
objection
--
no
objection
was
made
this
court
undertook
to
hear
and
determine
the
particular
objection
which
was
raised
as
to
the
jurisdiction.
now,
reference
had
been
made
to
section
1492
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code
which
grants
to
the
court
of
claims
the
power
and
the
function
to
pass
on
these
congressional
reference
cases.
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
act
of
1953
which
undertook
--
which
was
an
undertaking
by
congress
to
describe
the
court
of
claims
as
the
--
an
article
iii
court.
congress
eliminated
from
title
28
chapter
91
the
reference
to
the
departmental
reference
cases
which
were
to
the
heads
of
various
departments.
they
eliminated
that
provision
by
the
same
act
but
retain
this
congressional
reference
case.
now,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that,
and
i
would
like
to
call
to
your
honors
attention
the
remarks
made
by
senator
gore
at
the
time
of
the
hearings
held
with
respect
to
this
1953
legislation
and
i
referred
to
a
footnote
on
page
12
of
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
in
which
senator
gore
stated,
“if
in
the
future,
judges
of
the
court
of
claims
should
refused
to
act
upon
congressional
reference
cases
on
the
ground
that
they
are
not
within
the
proper
scope
of
jurisdiction
of
a
constitutional
court.
i
suppose
a
simple
remedy
will
be
for
congress
to
redesignate
the
court
of
claims
as
a
legislative
court.”
i
refer
that
to
your
honors
to
indicate
that
congress
in
describing
this
court
as
an
article
iii
court
has
the
feeling
apparently
that
it
may
redesignate
the
court
at
anytime
it
sees
fit
to
serve
its
purposes.
i
want
to
thank
you.
mr.
roger
robb
i
do
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
do
except
with
respect
to
cases
against
the
sovereign.
mr.
roger
robb
that
is
true
but
the
sovereign
cannot
be
sued
without
the
sovereign's
consent
and
may
lay
every
condition
it
sees
fit
to
lay
upon.
mr.
roger
robb
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
would
say
yes.
i
think
sovereign
can
lay
any
conditions
--
mr.
roger
robb
including
conditions
of
the
type
that
your
honor
--
mr.
roger
robb
--
refers
to.
mr.
roger
robb
i'm
afraid
the
only
answer
that
i
can
make
to
that
is
that
the
sovereign
can
lay
down
any
conditions
that
it
sees
fit
to
lay
down
with
respect
to
being
sued
and
not
being
sued.
mr.
roger
robb
i'd
say
yes.
mr.
roger
robb
i
say
yes.
mr.
roger
robb
that's
right.
mr.
roger
robb
thank
you,
sir.
