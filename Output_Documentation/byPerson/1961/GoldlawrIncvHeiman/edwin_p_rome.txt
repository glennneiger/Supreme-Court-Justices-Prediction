mr.
edwin
p.
rome
in
submission
to
your
honors,
this
honorable
court
has
granted
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
that
court
was
composed
of
judges
hincks,
waterman
and
moore.
judge
moore
wrote
the
decision
below
for
the
majority
of
the
circuit
court
with
judge
hincks
writing
a
dissenting
opinion.
the
question
for
review
if
your
honors
please
is
the
following.
did
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
having
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
the
action,
a
private
antitrust
suit
have
power
to
transfer
the
case
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1406
(a)
for
improper
venue
without
having
obtained
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
transferred
defendants.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
simple
and
are
not
in
dispute.
i
would
undertake
to
state
them
briefly.
goldlawr
incorporated
is
a
pennsylvania
corporation
which
sued
a
number
of
corporate
and
individual
defendants
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
under
the
antitrust
laws
charging
that
there
had
been
damaged
suffered
by
it
as
the
result
of
the
nationwide
monopolization
and
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
the
defendants,
unreasonably
to
restraints
trade
in
the
legitimate
theatre
industry.
trouble
damages
and
injunctive
relief
were
sought
by
the
plaintiff
corporation.
the
action
was
instituted
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
easter
district
court
of
pennsylvania
on
october
17,
1956
within
one
year
from
the
date
of
entry
of
a
consent
decree
in
the
government's
antitrust
action
against
the
shubert's
in
connection
with
the
legitimate
theatre
industry.
the
purpose
of
that
institution
within
that
one
year
was
of
course
to
secure
the
benefits
of
the
tolling
statute
under
section
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act.
service
on
all
of
the
defendants
was
attempted
in
philadelphia
and
thereafter,
service
was
attempted
also
on
select
operating
corporation
and
the
united
booking
office
incorporated,
two
of
the
corporate
respondents
here
by
alias
summons
issued
out
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
motions
were
filed
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
improper
venue
and
also
to
quash
the
return
of
service.
these
were
filed
in
november
of
1956.
the
matter
came
on
for
argument
having
been
fixed
by
the
honorable
william
kraft
in
philadelphia
in
june
of
1957
and
was
decided
on
december
22,
1958.
at
which
time,
there
was
a
rejection
by
judge
kraft
of
certain
motions
and
a
grant
of
certain
other
motions
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
respondents
who
are
here
now.
before
there
was
actually
an
order
entered,
there
was
application
made
by
the
plaintiff
seeking
the
transfer
of
the
action
to
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
that
was
granted
by
judge
kraft
conformably
to
section
1406
(a).
there
was
no
specific
reference
by
judge
kraft
to
the
problem
of
jurisdiction
or
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
transferred
defendants.
thereafter
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
the
clerk
of
that
court
refused
to
issue
new
summonses
to
the
transferred
defendants
for
the
reason
that
there
were
already
returns
of
service
of
those
summonses
as
to
those
defendants
from
the
action
in
the
easter
district
court
of
philadelphia.
the
individuals
who
had
been
transferred,
three
in
number
filed
answers
in
new
york
and
the
matter
continues
as
to
them.
but
the
two
corporate
defendants
select
operating
company
and
ubo,
united
booking
office
renewed
their
motions
to
dismiss
and
thereafter,
judge
palmieri
in
the
southern
district
granted
their
motions.
this
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes
sir.
at
the
time
of
argument
in
the
easter
district
court
in
philadelphia
sir,
mr.
heiman
was
still
alive
and
there
had
been
an
effort
made
to
serve
him
by
leaving
a
copy
of
the
summons
at
an
office
in
philadelphia.
thereafter,
he
died
and
i
must
admit
quite
frankly
sir,
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
substitute
his
executors
or
trustees
thereafter.
the
fact
is
that
insofar
as
mr.
heiman
or
his
estate
is
concern,
we
as
petitioners
here
do
not
press
any
point
with
regard
to
the
decision
made
below
in
--
in
his
case.
thereafter
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes
sir.
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
mr.
chief
justice
that
if
the
action
had
been
started
in
new
york
and
indeed,
it
could
have
been
started
in
new
york,
it
--
it
would
have
been
possible
of
the
plaintiff
to
secure
service
upon
them.
this,
if
your
honor
would
permit,
leads
me
to
address
myself
to
the
actual
facts
of
the
matter.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
--
because
goldlawr
incorporated
is
a
pennsylvania
corporation
which
owns
and
operates
the
erlanger
theatre
in
the
city
of
philadelphia.
its
complaint
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
effectively,
it
was
denied
opportunity
to
license
and
present
within
its
theatre
legitimate
place
in
philadelphia
for
philadelphia
audiences
or
persons
coming
to
philadelphia
to
attend
the
theatre
there.
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
is
that
there
was
a
nationwide
monopoly
and
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
all
the
defendants.
in
our
judgment
sir,
the
essential
operative
facts
of
the
case
have
to
do
with
philadelphia.
the
theatre
is
located
in
philadelphia.
the
place
that
would
have
been
presented
for
force
would
have
been
shown
in
philadelphia
and
the
plaintiff
made
a
choice
of
forum
in
philadelphia
because
they
were
the
main
and
essential
contacts
with
that
forum.
but
i
repeat
in
response
to
your
honor's
question,
it
would
have
in
our
judgment
and
i
do
not
think
my
friend
would
dispute
this,
it
would
have
been
possible
indeed,
he
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
it
would
have
been
possible
to
bring
the
action
in
new
york
and
service
would
have
been
made
there.
the
court
of
appeals
below
that,
if
the
court
please,
held
in
affirming
judge
palmieri's
decision
that
there
was
not
personal
jurisdiction
obtained
over
the
transferred
defendants
and
hence
the
transfer
of
the
case
was
improper
and
granted
the
motions
to
dismiss.
it
did
not
so
hold
because
of
any
feeling
that
this
was
more
in
the
interest
of
justice
than
would
have
been
the
case
if
the
transfer
had
been
sustained
nor
indeed
did
it
feel
that
there
was
any
clear
cut
line
of
authority
in
that
regard.
now,
i
think
(inaudible)
would
require
me
to
say
to
your
honors
that
there
is
a
--
an
anomalous
situation
within
the
cases
decided
on
this
point.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
of
course
sir.
the
statute
involved
says
the
following.
the
district
court
of
a
district
in
which
is
filed
a
case
laying
venue
in
the
wrong
division
or
district
shall
dismiss
or
if
it
be
in
the
interest
of
justice,
transfer
such
case
to
any
district
or
division
in
which
it
could
have
been
brought.
there
is
as
that
language
i
think
states
no
reference
to
whether
or
not
personal
jurisdiction
should
have
been
secured
in
the
transferor
district
and
indeed,
the
courts
below
have
recognized
that
there
is
no
such
language.
the
court
below,
however,
has
concluded
by
implication
from
the
senate
report
discussing
the
particular
statute
at
the
time
of
its
passage
that
by
implication
since
there
was
an
example
given
which
seemed
to
speak
in
terms
of
service
or
personal
jurisdiction
having
been
obtained
that
therefore,
personal
jurisdiction
in
the
form
of
service
is
required
as
a
prerequisite
to
the
transfer.
in
our
submission,
if
the
court
please,
this
writ,
this
conclusion
reads
into
this
language
a
requirement
that
the
specific
words
do
not
set
forth
which
judge
hincks
at
least
below
thought
was
unnecessary
and
which
judge
parker
in
the
internatio
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
also
which
professor
moore
feels
to
be
a
less
than
satisfactory
result.
the
court
below
in
the
second
circuit
seemingly
felt
bound
by
an
implication
as
i
as
say
from
the
congressional
record
or
perhaps
by
some
feeling
of
uneasiness
that
its
own
earlier
decision
in
1950
in
the
schiller
case
led
to
the
chain
of
events
which
caused
other
courts
including
that
of
the
fourth
circuit
to
hold
that
personal
service
or
jurisdiction
was
not
in
fact
required.
it
attempted
to
distinguish
those
other
cases
by
referring
to
them
as
admiralty
cases.
and
further,
it
was
reasoned
that
since
the
specific
statute
involved
1406
(a)
was
designed
to
cure
a
defect
of
venue,
it
ought
not
to
be
able
to
be
used
to
cure
a
more
grievous
defect
of
jurisdiction
without
specific
clear
congressional
mandate.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
the
practical
consequences
of
this
your
honor
pleases,
is
the
following.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
that
the
petitioner
is
now
in
the
predicament
of
being
unable
to
pursue
a
substantial
part
of
his
claim
against
these
dismissed
defendants
because
of
the
fact
that
we
will
have
lost
the
benefit
of
the
tolling
statute
--
of
the
tolling
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
our
action
was
originally
begun
as
i
said
in
the
philadelphia
within
one
year
of
the
end
of
the
consent
decree
in
the
government's
suit.
therefore,
we
wouldn't
have
had
and
did
in
fact
have
the
benefit
of
the
tolling
statute.
now,
because
transfer
is
held
to
be
improper,
to
the
extent
we
institute
another
action
against
these
defendants
in
the
--
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
we
are
not
able
to
take
the
case
back
to
1950
and
hence
we'll
suffer
irreparable
harm
because
a
great
many
of
the
operative
facts
which
we
rely
upon
just
establishing
the
monopolization
and
the
conspiracy
occurred
in
that
earlier
period
of
time.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
no
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
the
amount
of
damage
is
cut
down
substantially
sir
and
we
say
that
it
is
not
really
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
permit
this
situation
to
happen.
actually,
i
would
take
it
that
your
honors
grant
of
certiorari
here
is
an
evidence
of
your
continuing
interest
in
the
problems
revolving
around
the
transfer
statutes.
obviously,
within
recent
time,
there
are
i
think
two
decisions
connected
--
in
connection
with
1404
(a)
in
hoffman
versus
blaski
and
the
continental
grain.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
we
were
thrown
out
as
to
these
defendants
mr.
justice
frankfurter
because
judge
kraft
following
a
deliberation
and
consideration
of
the
problem
for
18
months
concluded
that
there
were
not
sufficient
context
as
to
these
defendants
to
warrant
the
application
of
section
12
of
the
clayton
act
so
as
to
permit
service
to
be
had
as
to
these
defendants
but
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
could
have
been
done,
yes
sir.
but
actually
as
judge
hincks
recognizes
below,
there
was
indeed
a
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff
in
bringing
one
action
within
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
because
this
then
did
not
fragment
the
litigation.
it
did
not
lead
as
we
then
sought
to
a
multiplicity
of
suits.
all
of
the
operative
facts
were
the
essentials
ones
in
the
view
of
counsel
took
place
within
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
very
length
of
time
that
was
required
by
the
district
judge
in
philadelphia
to
make
an
ultimate
determination
of
the
problem
and
the
nicety
of
detail
with
which
he
dissected
the
problem
really
in
our
judgment
demonstrates
the
good
faith
of
plaintiff
in
bringing
the
action.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
do
not
have
the
temerity
to
suggest
sir
that
judge
kraft
in
the
busy
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
was
devoting
his
time
exclusively
to
this
matter.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
think
that
is
it
a
necessary
heart
of
the
determination
of
the
transferor
court
because
in
the
interest
of
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
am
aware
of
that
sir
and
i'm
not
trying
to
avoid
answering
your
honor's
question
but
it
seems
to
me
that
initially,
there
should
be
recognition
given
by
the
transferee
court
to
the
determination
made
by
the
transferor
court.
and
yet,
i
cannot
say
in
light
of
my
reading
of
your
honor's
opinions
that
it
was
been
entirely
without
basis
for
the
transferring
court
to
make
an
independent
determination
of
good
faith
or
whether
it
was
in
the
interest
of
justice.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
make
reference
to
it
mr.
justice
frankfurter
because
it
would
appear
that
since
the
statute
does
think
in
terms
of
interest
of
justice.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes
sir.
i
think
that
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
indeed.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
indeed
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
the
question
of
whether
it
seems
to
me
the
plaintiff
was
shopping
improvidently
for
a
jurisdiction
whether
he
had
or
had
not
any
reasonable
basis
to
suppose
that
the
court
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
no
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
but
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
but
there
was
presented
to
the
judge
in
the
transferor
court
a
variety
of
evidence
emanating
out
of
affidavits
and
depositions
with
regard
to
the
matter
so
that
it
was
able
to
make
a
determination
not
in
a
vacuum,
not
based
upon
facts
in
limbo
and
indeed
not
based
upon
a
failure
of
the
defendants
to
have
their
day
in
court
and
present
argument
against
the
possibility
of
transfer.
i
am
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
the
hohensee
case
did
take
into
account
that
there
might
be
some
abuse
arising
out
of
the
fact
that
service
was
extended
improperly
or
run
duly
and
yet,
it
would
appear
that
this
is
answered
by
the
very
kinds
of
considerations
that
your
honor
referred
to
in
your
own
opinion
in
the
hoffman
versus
blaski.
and
the
--
the
normal
criteria
of
good
faith,
however,
they
might
be
enunciated
in
our
judgment
would
be
found
here
and
this
has
not
really
been
attacked
or
denied
by
the
court
below
or
even
by
my
friends
on
the
other
side.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
would
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes
sir
but
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
think
not
in
this.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
that
might
be
true,
your
honor.
but
again,
this
would
seem
to
me
to
be
safeguarded
by
the
caring
consideration
that
would
inevitably
be
given
to
the
matter
by
the
district
judge
and
the
transferor
court.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
that
kind
of
thing
would
--
and
in
my
judgment
your
honor
inevitably
would
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
judge
in
the
transferor
court.
actually,
under
these
circumstances,
there
would
appear
to
be
no
lack
of
power
on
the
part
of
the
transferor
court
under
the
statute
to
do
what
it
did
because
this
i
think
is
answered
by
the
apt
language
of
judge
parker
in
the
fourth
circuit
where
he
spoke
in
terms
of
jurisdiction
over
the
proceedings.
there
is
no
danger
that
could
defendants
would
be
harmed
or
prejudiced
here
in
light
of
the
fact
that
inevitably
in
the
transferee
court,
there
would
have
to
be
service
made
upon
them
and
we
recognize
here
on
all
sides
that
service
could
indeed
be
affected
within
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
hence,
this
is
not
a
situation
such
as
confronted
your
honors
in
hoffman
versus
blaski
by
way
of
the
illustration
where
the
action
could
not
have
been
brought
originally
in
the
transferee
court.
insofar
as
the
basic
result
returning
to
your
honor's
question
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
is
one
further
element
which
is
truly,
not
only
with
regard
to
the
petitioner
here,
but
we
think
with
regard
to
many
other
parties
who
would
be
similarly
situated
under
the
present
state
of
the
law
and
the
decisions.
it
would
seem
to
be
true
that
the
criteria
for
venue
and
the
criteria
for
service
or
process
so
as
to
affect
jurisdiction
are
essentially
the
same.
and
hence,
the
result
reached
below
would
seem
largely
to
vitiate
the
effectiveness
of
1406
(a)
because
if
it
is
impossible
to
have
proper
venue,
it
is
also
improper
to
have
jurisdiction
within
the
transferor
court
and
if
transit
in
--
if
jurisdiction
within
the
transferor
court
is
required,
then
a
number
of
statutes
cited
in
our
brief
would
be
seriously
curtailed
in
their
effectiveness
and
an
illustration
of
it
is
found
in
this
very
case
under
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
as
to
corporate
defendants,
it
would
seem
to
me
--
to
be
so
sir
because
the
necessary
requirements
to
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
essentially
sir
because
in
this
specific
case
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
no,
of
course
not,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
no,
but
they
are
the
one
sir
as
to
whom
this
problem
it
would
appear
more
usually
arises.
and
hence,
i
would
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
no,
i
do
not
for
a
moment
suggest
that
to
be
so
but
the
report
and
the
consideration
given
to
the
legislation
at
the
time
of
its
passage
does
make
reference
to
it.
and
in
light
of
the
comment
made
upon
at
below,
i
was
attempting
to
invite
your
honors
on
consideration
or
attention
to
that
aspect
of
the
problem.
in
ultimate
essence,
this
case
represents
therefore
perhaps
another
aspect
or
another
side
of
the
coin
which
your
honors
have
had
before
you
in
hoffman
versus
blaski
and
the
continental
grain
case
because
in
those
instances,
defendants
were
seeking
to
affect
transfer
to
jurisdictions
where
the
action
might
not
initially
have
been
brought
against
them.
here,
we
have
a
plaintiff
under
1406
(a)
seeking
to
affect
a
transfer
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
a
jurisdiction
where
indisputably,
the
action
might
originally
have
been
brought.
and
yet
here,
under
the
ruling
of
the
law,
the
plaintiff
has
denied
the
opportunity
or
right
to
do
that
although
the
judge
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
felt
that
it
was
in
conformity
with
1406
(a)
to
permit
it
and
both
majority
and
dissenting
opinion
below
would
seem
to
be
in
one
view
as
to
the
propriety
of
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
affecting
ultimate
justice.
the
view
with
deference
to
the
court
below
of
the
majority
would
seem
to
turn
upon
therefore
a
more
narrowly
limited
construction
of
1406
than
the
very
words
of
the
statute
would
require
and
has
the
net
result
of
doing
substantial
damage,
harm
to
the
petitioner
here
because
as
i
have
stated,
it
cuts
off
a
very
considerable
measure
of
the
damage
period.
we
think
that
the
statute
as
drawn
on
its
very
faith
insofar
as
the
plain
words
are
concerned
would
permit
the
transfer.
we
think
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
congressional
record
or
report
having
to
do
with
the
passage
of
the
legislation
that
would
preclude
it
the
result
of
sustaining
the
transfer.
indeed,
the
one
illustration
given
in
the
senate
report
that
represents
an
element
of
caution
where
the
illustrations
spoke
in
terms
of
a
situation
in
which
jurisdiction
had
been
obtained
in
the
transferor
court
is
indeed
answered
by
your
honors'
decision
in
the
hoffman
versus
blaski.
and
hence,
that
fear
no
longer
would
seem
to
be
well-founded.
and
finally,
it
would
seem
that
the
result
here
does
prevent
the
plaintiff
without
an
opportunity
to
have
his
day
in
court
on
the
merits
being
precluded
unnecessarily.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
the
decisions
in
the
lower
court,
sir,
i
am
bound
to
say
represented
element
of
confusion.but
it
would
appear
in
my
mind
clear
that
the
circuit
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
the
fourth
circuit
indeed
earlier
decisions
within
the
second
circuit,
earlier
decisions
of
the
district
court
in
the
third
circuit
would
support
the
transfer
without
the
necessity
of
having
acquired
personal
jurisdiction.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
the
second,
third
and
fourth.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
no,
it
would
appear
not
to
if
there
wasn't
accept
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
has
arisen
in,
to
my
best
recollection
sir,
five
district
courts
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
no,
most
of
them
are
within
those
circuits
actually,
sir.
i
think
too
that
a
reading
of
the
cases
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
only
recently
in
the
second
circuit
in
this
very
case,
in
the
third
circuit
in
the
hohensee
case
and
in
judge
parker's
decision
in
internatio
in
the
fourth
circuit
has
the
matter
really
been
the
subject
of
any
discussion.
it
frequently
would
appear
that
results
were
reached
either
granting
transfer
or
denying
transfer,
without
any
articulation
of
reason
being
given
by
the
court.
but
in
those
three
cases
that
invite
your
honors'
attention
too,
there
is
actually
discussion
of
the
problem.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
was
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
was
an
admiralty
case
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
in
the
sense
that
transfer
is
denied
there
but
i
would
suggest
for
your
honors'
consideration
that
1404
may
not
necessarily
be
entirely
applicable
to
our
problem
under
1406
(a),
1404
normally
has
to
do
with
an
application
by
defendants
for
transfer
where
historically
there
is
acceptable
venue
in
at
least
two
jurisdictions.
here,
we
start
almost
by
hypothesis
with
wrong
venue
in
the
transferor
court
and
hence
that
might
too
post
a
difference.
i
think
actually,
a
fair
reading
of
the
decisions
even
though
they'd
be
admiralty
cases
would
indicate
and
i
think
this
is
most
particularly
true
of
judge
parker's
decision,
to
have
turned
not
upon
the
fact
of
it's
being
an
admiralty
case
but
truly
upon
the
intension
conceived
by
judge
parker
to
be
found
back
of
1406
(a)
where
he
said
that
time
consuming
and
justice
defeating
technicality,
so
it's
not
to
be
permitted
to
weigh
in
the
balance
adverse
to
the
transfer.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
think
your
honor
would
find,
there
are
two
cases
that
really
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
think
sir,
that
there
would
be
only
two
cases
that
would
touch
upon
what
your
honor
has
in
mind.
one
is
a
decision
by
judge
van
dusen
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
in
the
orszulak
case.
another
is
--
that
of
judge
dimock
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
where
he
felt
himself
bound
to
follow
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
schiller
case
although
expressing
some
reservation
as
to
the
propriety
of
that
decision
on
ultimate
--
in
ultimate
essence.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
forgive
me,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
cannot
say,
your
honor
that
there
is
any
decision.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
would
appear
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
would
appear
your
honor
from
the
number
of
cases
that
we
have
found
and
which
are
cited
on
our
brief
and
also
in
mr.
phillips'
brief
that
this
is
a
situation
that
does
arise
with
some
frequency.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
in
some
instances,
not
even
reported
decisions
in
other
instances,
merely
the
entry
of
an
order
of
transfer.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
judge
van
dusen
granted
the
order
of
transfer
even
though
there
had
been
no
personal
jurisdiction
in
that
case.
this
is
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
thereafter,
the
third
circuit
in
the
hohensee
case
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
well,
it
doesn't
say
that
it
can't
be
done,
sir
except
by
implication
referring
to
it
as
an
admiralty
case
which
was
based
on
internatio
which
in
turn
was
an
admiralty
case.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
in
my
judgment
sir,
a
very
reasoned
opinion.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
that
is
--
i
didn't
know
sir.
sorry
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
orszulak,
your
honor.
i
apologize
for
not
being
able
to
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
forgive
me,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
is
a
recent
decision
just
shortly
before
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
in
the
hohensee
case.
it
is
thrust
to
one
side
by
judge
daley
as
being
essentially
based
on
the
fact
of
admiralty.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
orszulak
--
o-r-s-z-u-l-a-k
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
is
found
sir
in
168
federal
supplement
at
15.
it's
also
referred
to
by
judge
hincks
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
would
just
ask
leave
to
bring
to
your
honors
attention
the
fact
that
mr.
phillips
said
inverted
in
passing
to
the
conclusion
of
the
court
below
in
the
majority
opinion
about
the
use
of
the
language
and
the
actual
placing
of
the
words
of
1406
as
being
indicative
that
it
was
intended
only
to
cure
a
venue
defect.
actually
however,
no
inference
of
course
of
legislative
construction
as
to
be
drawn
from
the
placing
of
the
statute
or
the
title
headings
of
it.
the
other
point
that
i
would
ask
leave
to
mention
is
that
regardless
of
what
one
may
say
concerning
the
subsequent
analysis
by
the
second
circuit
of
its
decision
in
schiller.
it
remains
true
that
the
second
circuit
did
in
fact
sustained
a
transfer
of
a
case
where
there
had
not
been
jurisdiction
in
the
transferor
court.
and
finally
that
judge
parker,
even
though
this
was
an
admiralty
case
in
the
internatio
in
the
fourth
circuit
rest
his
conclusions
squarely
on
the
language
and
the
purpose
of
1406.
thank
you,
sir.
