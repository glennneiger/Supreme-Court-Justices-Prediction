john
m.
harlan
but
what
about
the
defendant's
time?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
mr.
rome,
what
are
the
practical
consequences
of
this
view,
assuming
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
stands?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
not
barred
absolutely
by
limitation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
amount
of
your
damage
isn't
cut
down
in
effect?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
was
the
approach
that
judge
hincks
took
in
dissent.
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
said
that
the
abuses,
that
the
majority
appeared
if
your
construction
was
adopted
where
impart
offended
against
by
the
fact
that
the
transferor
court
would
be
thought
there
was
not
good
faith,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
but
denying
the
interest
of
justice
transfer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
weight
of
decision
in
the
lower
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
judge
parker's
decision
was
in
admiralty
case
whether
or
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
distinguishable
or
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
there
are
a
group
of
cases
that
go
under
1404.
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
are
against
him,
aren't
they
on
them
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
see
it
in
your
index.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
should
we
take
the
statute
on
its
face
read
it
literally
it
isn't
evident
this
compelling
--
it
compels
wanted
to
take
your
view
of
the
case,
is
it?
