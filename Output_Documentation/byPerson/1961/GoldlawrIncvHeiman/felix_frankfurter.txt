before
you
go
to
the
case,
don't
you
think
it
would
be
desirable
to
read
the
statute
and
in
fact,
you
read
it
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
were
you
thrown
out
in
philadelphia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
brought
proceedings
contemporaneously
both
in
new
york
and
philadelphia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
suggest
that
--
that
the
judges
in
philadelphia
did
nothing
during
those
18
months
except
to
handover
this
problem,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
dissenting
--
you
made
two
or
three
references
to
good
faith,
must
have
transferee
court
determine
whether
there
were
good
faith
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
heavily
chose
my
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
the
purpose
of
--
or
the
reason
for
my
question
was
that
if
you
open
the
door
to
the
transferee
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
error
and
--
and
the
feelings
of
the
wrong
jurisdiction
as
a
good
faith
error,
that
to
me
is
not
very
appealing
factor,
perhaps
to
take
into
account
to
construe
this
kind
of
a
jurisdictional
or
procedural
--
jurisdictional
or
procedural
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what's
transferor
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
he
must
--
i
suppose
he
must
take
into
account
or
others
relevant
that
to
determine
whether
in
the
interests
of
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
--
what
kind
of
consideration
entered
to
whether
into
the
issue
of
good
faith
in
this
connection,
the
private
consideration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
--
if
the
transferor
judge
called
witnesses
and
cross-examined?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
counsel
said
that
he
would
make
it.
i'm
just
trying
to
explore
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
lies
behind
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
considerations,
the
state
law
claiming
--
i
don't
mean
state
procedural
law,
the
state
substantive
law,
any
--
any
(inaudible)
problem
entered
into
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
--
in
a
diversity
case,
they
would.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
your
case,
not
in
a
federal
right
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
diversity
case,
you'd
have
nothing
but
state
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
there
might
be
--
counsel
might
take
or
join
this
view
of
what
--
what
state
laws
in
one
state
as
again
state
law
in
another
state.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
the
transferor
court,
the
opposing
counsel
would
say,
well,
your
honor,
it's
perfectly
plain
that
suit
was
sought
to
be
the
jurisdiction
or
venue
was
sought
to
be
satisfied
in
the
state
x
because
state
x
is
content
of
law.
the
rule
is
transfers
it
to
state
y
and
state
x
is
more
favorable
than
to
that
and
if
you
bring
it
to
the
state
y,
that
kind
of
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you
but
appreciate
at
least
your
argument.
did
you
say
that
substantially
there
is
an
equation
between
venue
and
--
and
jurisdictional
service
or
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
other
way
around
for
the
corporation
sue
an
individual,
you
get
very
different
situation
as
to
--
different
elements
give
venue
to
a
large
extent
in
the
federal
court.
that's
in
almost
arbitrary
matter,
not
arbitrary
but,
the
congress
has
a
matter
of
choice
determines
what
is
the
fair
break
for
trial
and
jurisdiction
is
presupposed.
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
--
that
--
that
satisfying
requirement
of
due
process,
that's
what
it
ultimately
gets
down
with.
so
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you
--
you
equate
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case
because
you
can
justify
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
might
be
so
with
reference
to
--
to
corporations
in
light
of
the
shoe
case
et
cetera.
but
one
has
to
consider
--
those
aren't
the
only
litigants
in
this
world
or
they
are
not
only
the
defendants.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
an
individual
suing
a
corporation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
corporation
is
amenable
by
some
tenuous
connection
with
the
locality
and
that
gives
venue,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
making
a
lot
assumptions
i
think
that
this
statute
was
passed
with
reference
to
litigation
by
corporate
plaintiffs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
circuits
have
passed
on?
how
many
courts
have
--
in
the
first
place,
how
many
courts
of
appeals?
this
statute
has
been
on
the
books
since
1949.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
13
years.
how
many
courts
have
appealed
with
that
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
those
three?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
it
arisen
in
others.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
district
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
most
side
of
those
circuits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rome
may
i
ask
where
the
district
courts
in
acting
under
1406
refusing
to
transfer?
have
they
on
the
whole
of
just
decided
without
writing
opinions
or
is
there
a
body
of
--
of
expressed
reasoning
or
explanation
when
they
had
done
these
motions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
our
immediate
problem.
i'm
talking
about
the
way
district
courts
go
about
in
14
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
1406?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
if
you're
talking
about
the
same
thing
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
the
interest
--
in
the
interest
of
justice
that's
for
the
district
court
to
--
to
marshal
massive
considerations
for
and
--
gone.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
as
the
second
circuit
directed
the
district
court,
what
considerations
are
irrelevant
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
often
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
these
motions
have
any
kind
of
frequency
--
justice

--
in
commercial

what

the

justice

don't
bother.
is
it
on
your
brief?
justice
felix

what's
the
name
of
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
take
your
time,
mr.
rome.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
find
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
could
have
--
correct
me.
you
could
have
had
a
certificate
from
the
district
court
disassociating
your
--
making
an
appeal
of
them
in
short
under
recent
statutes
over
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
district
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
preceded
that
rule,
just
preceded
that
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
it
in
--
in
this
very
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
you're
unfair
to
the
statute
of
philadelphia
because
to
my
knowledge
not
a
few
have
shows
that
first
tried
out
in
philadelphia
to
see
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
didn't
survive
in
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
most
sophisticated
audiences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
the
other
way
around
mr.
phillips,
sending
your
--
your
duly
served
philadelphia
clients
to
new
york,
is
there
any
power,
has
anybody
thought?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
--
under
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
more
convenience.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
you
think
you
are
in
no
position,
that's
why
i
was
wondering?
you
say
you
are
in
no
position,
do
i
ask,
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
just
said
a
little
while
ago,
that's
the
reason
i
asked
the
question.
i
thought
you
said
it's
now
irrevocably
split
up
into
two
counts,
is
that
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
in
the
interest
of
justice,
afraid
of
deficiency,
well
it's
not
fully
unlimited
in
the
judicial
--
judicial
interest
must
have
interest
relevant
or
judicial
judgment
must
be
taken
into
account.
but
i
should
think
considerations
of
such
as
of
the
main
--
main
witnesses
or
numerous
other
plaintiffs,
defendants
are
in
the
new
york,
all
those
are
relevant
to
1404,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
perhaps
mr.
phillips,
both
you
and
i
are
bound
by
hoffman
and
blaski
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
got
it
in
--
well
--
you'll
start
with
that
in
--
in
full
deference
to
it.
what
comfort
or
discomfort
you
get
from
that
case
with
reference
to
this
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
the
--
the
situation
of
the
two
if
the
two
sections
deal
with
a
very
different
--
are
different,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
quite
different
because
in
hoffman-blaski,
you've
got
a
court
that
has
jurisdictions
--
there's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
no
doubt,
no
doubt
that
the
court
could
litigate.
they
could
let
the
litigation
go
forward.
and
then
it
is
ours
as
a
matter
of
--
of
so
called
i'm
using
the
word
conclusively
equitable
consideration,
consideration
of
fairness
or
the
administration
of
justice
to
send
in
to
another
court.
now,
what
this
court
decided
in
blaski
was
that
to
ask
a
court
or
allow
a
court
to
give
up
its
conceded
jurisdiction
in
the
interest
of
the
justice,
to
a
court
with
initially
or
fundamentally
couldn't
have
conceived
with
the
jurisdiction
is
straightening
the
statute
is
doing
something
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
here,
you
got
the
reverse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
got
just
the
reverse
namely,
that
you've
got
a
court
which
--
which
transcribe
a
case
and
congress
up
to
1948
said
if
that
so,
if
you've
chosen
the
wrong
forum,
too
bad,
lawyers
are
supposed
to
be
learned
people.
it's
a
large
assumption
that
you
must
face.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
anyhow,
they
must
make
a
choice
on
these
matters.
they
made
the
wrong
choice
and
that's
that.
along
comes
in
congress
in
1948
and
then
in
1949
and
says,
"you've
begun
a
litigation
of
court
which
is
found
not
to
have
juris
--
not
to
have
power
to
dispose
of
the
litigation."
venue
problems
we
all
know,
that
we
all
--
all
of
us
lawyers
know
is
not
approximate
adding
to
and
to.
then
they
raised
dubious
problems,
don't
they?
and
so
you
have
a
court
which
concludes
that
it
can
dispose
of
the
case
sending
it
to
a
court
that
concededly
does
have
jurisdiction.
now,
in
the
practicality
of
--
of
the
conducts
of
affairs,
it's
a
very
different
thing
to
allow
a
court
which
has
power
to
dispose
off
litigation
to
send
it
to
a
court
which
initially
wouldn't
have
had
power.
as
again,
the
court
then
initially
doesn't
have
jurisdiction,
instead
of
letting
the
whole
metaphor,
send
it
of
course
that
concededly
does
have
jurisdiction.
all
i'm
suggesting
--
well,
it's
obvious
of
course
is
that
that
you
might
take
the
same
phrases
that
they
have
a
different
context
in
the
actual
administration
of
justice.
