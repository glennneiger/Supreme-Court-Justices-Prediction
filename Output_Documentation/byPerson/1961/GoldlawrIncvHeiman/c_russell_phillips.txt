mr.
c.
russell
phillips
with
permission
of
your
honors,
i
should
like
to
dispose
of
two
side
issues
to
begin
with.
the
first
involves
this
question
of
good
faith
and
i
think
we
may
have
gotten
on
the
wrong
foot
there.
there
is
no
question
whatsoever
of
good
faith
by
anybody
here.
it
just
happens
that
judge
hincks
in
his
dissenting
opinion
pointed
out
that
the
plaintiff
was
not
acting
just
capriciously
in
trying
to
serve
these
defendants
in
philadelphia,
and
he
held
that
they
acted
in
good
faith.
there
was
no
question
of
judge
kraft's
good
faith
or
was
there
every
any
attack
on
his
decision
in
anyway
except
on
the
pure
question
of
law
which
is
here
before
your
honors.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
yes
--
no,
sir.
no,
sir.
the
plaintiff
filed
a
motion.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
the
plaintiff
filed
the
motion,
sir.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
you
can
hardly
say
it
was
in
response.
i
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
judge
kraft
felt
i
was
entitled
to
that
motion.
then
immediately
the
plaintiff
requested
a
transfer
instead
of
dismissal.
and
judge
kraft
signed
the
order
of
transfer
without
any
opinion.
i
may
say
that
he
must
have
suffered
considerable
torment
at
the
time
because
he
made
his
decision
before
any
of
these
decisions
that
we're
talking
about
here.
the
other
collateral
point
that
i
should
like
to
get
out
of
the
way
is
this.
professor
moore
has
considered
this
question,
and
has
announced
that
the
rule
of
the
other
side
would
be
the
better
rule.
i
think
we
are
not
here
to
decide
what
ought
to
be
done.
we
have
here
simply
a
pure
simple
question
of
statutory
construction.
what
did
congress
do
in
this
new
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
courts?
whether
it
reached
the
ultimate
of
what's
best
for
the
country,
i
don't
know.
judge
parker
has
considered
that
in
one
of
these
cases
and
he
thinks
that
the
whole
of
the
united
states
has
now
become
a
homogenous
mass
so
that
an
action
should
be
brought
in
the
federal
court.
i'm
asigned
to
wherever
it
might
be
best
handled.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
well,
i
should
like
to
get
to
that
point
because
that
is
my
view.
we
seem
to
have
avoided
this
statute
and
the
question
is
not
really
what
ought
to
have
been
done
or
might
have
been
done.
but
what
did
congress
do?
and
we
must
remember
that
whether
it
was
good
or
bad
prior
to
1948,
federal
courts
had
no
such
power
to
transfer
back
and
forth.
in
1948,
the
statute
was
first
passed
and
it
was
mandatory.
if
under
1406
the
venue
is
brought
in
the
wrong
place,
the
court
has
got
to
transfer
it
to
a
place
where
the
suit
might
have
been
brought.
and
the
very
next
year,
congress
realized
the
difficulty
there
because
then
the
surest
way
of
getting
jurisdiction
into
the
federal
court
was
to
bring
it
as
far
from
home
base
as
you
could
and
leave
it
to
the
court
to
find
out
where
it
ought
too
have
been
brought
and
sent
it
there.
and
the
very
next
year,
congress
gave
the
district
court
the
right
to
determine
whether
that
should
be
done
or
not
in
the
interest
of
justice.
so
now,
if
you
bring
a
suit
in
the
wrong
district,
you
run
the
risk
that
the
court
may
say
that's
not
fair.
judge
hincks
pointed
out
that
that
is
not
involved
here.
it
must
also
be
recognized
that
the
only
question
here
is
the
simple
ones
they
did
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
may
a
court
which
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
where
service
has
never
been
made,
transfer
under
section
1406
to
some
of
their
district
where
the
suit
might
have
been
brought.
now,
when
judge
kraft
signed
this
order,
i
have
the
difficult
decision
of
what
to
do
about
it.
this
transfer
order
affected
only
some
of
the
defendants.
and
if
your
honors
will
remember
section
54
(b)
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
the
interlocutory
appeal
section,
it
is
provided
there
that
you
may
appeal
if
the
court
permits
you
whether
it
has
been
a
decision
on
some
but
less
than
all
of
the
causes
of
action.
a
great
many
cases
arose
and
i
think
none
of
them
reached
this
court
but
all
of
them
decided
that
a
decision
as
to
some
but
less
than
all
of
the
parties
is
not
the
equivalent
of
a
decision
on
some
but
less
than
all
of
the
causes.
that
therefore,
barred
me
from
an
appeal
in
the
--
in
the
third
circuit.
so
when
case
was
transferred,
i
followed
it
through
and
move
to
dismiss
in
that
court.
your
honors
are
pretty
much
--
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
i
think
that
i
could
today
because
your
honors
very
recently
amended
54
(b)
to
provide
that
an
interlocutory
appeal
maybe
permitted
where
the
decision
involves
some
but
less
than
all
of
the
parties.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
if
the
district
court
approved
it
but
in
those
--
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
yes,
sir.
this
preceded
that
recent
change
in
the
rules.
and
there
again,
i
think
your
honors
amendment
of
the
rule
if
i
may
say
so
improves
the
situation
but
that
didn't
mean
in
my
judgment
at
any
rate
that
i
have
the
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
had
litigation
on
that
subject
in
another
issue
here
and
did
not
succeed.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
yes,
sir.
in
this
very
case,
so
when
we
got
to
the
second
circuit
in
the
district
court,
i
moved
to
dismiss
there.
not
attacking
judge
kraft's
good
faith
at
all
but
just
simply
saying
that
under
the
statute
that
he
purported
to
follow,
he
didn't
have
the
right
to
move
my
clients
around
without
having
made
service.
that
made
a
difference
to
my
clients
because
by
that
time,
the
statute
of
limitation
had
moved
forward
so
that
the
period
for
which
damages
could
be
claimed
was
a
different
period
than
initially
was
involved.
and
if
i
may
digress
a
moment,
i
should
like
to
discuss
this
question
of
the
hardship
that
mr.
justice
harlan
mentioned
there
by
residing
just
a
little
of
the
time
schedule
here.
this
suit
was
started
on
october
1956.
mr.
rome
was
not
counsel
then.
the
counsel
at
that
time
withdrew
after
about
four
years.
the
complaint
asked
for
four
years
of
damages,
quite
obviously
overlooking
the
suspension
statute
that
has
been
referred
to
here.
i
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
a
lot
of
grounds,
lack
of
service
and
jurisdiction
and
also
under
the
ground
of
the
statute
of
limitations
because
even
on
the
plaintiffs
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
had
the
wrong
period.
and
being
fearful
of
the
rule
that
you
may
file
one
motion
and
you
must
include
it
in
all
your
reasons,
i
feared
that
if
i
didn't
mention
the
statute
of
limitations,
i
might
be
barred.
that
must
have
alerted
the
plaintiff
because
very
--
in
february
the
following
year,
it
filed
a
motion
to
amend
carrying
its
period
of
limitations,
its
damages,
back
a
couple
of
years
earlier
which
it
might
have
done
in
the
first
place.
the
point
i
mentioned
is
that
being
alerted
during
that
period
of
five
or
six
months
up
until
february
17th,
1957,
the
plaintiff
could
have
started
a
cautionary
action
in
new
york
where
my
clients
could
readily
have
been
served.
mr.
shubert's
are
indigenous
to
new
york
and
mr.
shubert
occupied
the
same
office
for
60
years.
there
is
no
question
of
service.
but
the
plaintiff
didn't
do
that.
until
august
1959,
almost
three
years
later
when
it
got
around
the
filing
of
cautionary
action
in
new
york
which
is
beyond
my
power
to
attack,
i
mentioned
all
of
this
because
if
there
is
any
hardship
in
this
case
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
it's
the
plaintiff's
own
doing.
it
was
alerted
by
my
motions
in
plenty
of
time.
in
fact,
one
of
my
objects
was
to
get
this
litigation
to
new
york
because
that's
where
the
shuberts
are.
and
any
conspiracy
alleged
to
keep
shows
away
from
this
erlanger
theatre
must
have
transpired
in
new
york.
that's
where
the
producers
are
and
i
think
i
needn't
argue
with
that
where
its
shows
originate.
we've
had
discovered
it
for
several
years
and
almost
all
of
it
in
new
york,
that's
where
this
litigation
belongs.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
yes,
sir
--
but
they
come
--
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
they
come
--
they
are
generated
in
new
york
where
the
producers
are
that's
where
they
rehearsed
and
then
they
send
them
to
new
haven
or
wilmington
or
philadelphia
for
tryouts.
incidentally
--
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
oh,
well
at
least
they
don't
--
they
are
better
if
your
honor
pleases
on
first
nights
because
they
don't
boo
and
walkout
on
the
first
night.
they
expect
some
changes
the
second
night
and
that's
what
happens.
incidentally,
this
erlanger
theatre
is
--
has
been
here
40
now.
mr.
goldman
who
owns
it
brought
an
action
against
the
movie
producers
for
keeping
movies
out
of
this
theatre
and
he
won.
during
all
litigation,
he
claimed
that
was
a
movie
theatre
and
no
good
for
plays.
as
soon
as
he
brought
his
movie
case,
he
didn't
put
any
movies
in
it
all
but
he
changed
and
claimed
that
it
is
now
a
legitimate
theatre
and
he
sued
the
shuberts
for
keeping
shows
away
not
at
the
same
time,
but
in
the
subsequent
period.
he
evidently
expected
shows
to
rush
to
it.
but
now
if
your
honors
will
look
at
this
statute,
the
district
court
of
a
district,
it's
on
page
2
of
my
brief.
i
think
your
honors
must
know
it
by
heart.
the
district
court
in
a
district
in
which
they
sue,
his
filing
venue,
in
the
wrong
division
or
district
shall
dismiss.
or
if
it'd
be
in
the
interest
of
justice
transfer
and
i
emphasize
such
case
to
any
district
or
division
in
which
it
could
have
been
brought.
this
could
all
have
been
brought
in
new
york.
those
words
such
case
are
interesting
because
here
you'll
observe
that
this
such
case
wasn't
transferred
to
new
york.
it
was
transferred
only
as
to
some
of
the
defendants.
i
don't
know
that
i
add
anything
new
to
my
argument
but
i
add
a
new
reason
for
it
because
in
the
absence
of
the
defendants,
this
case
was
not
only
transferred
but
it
was
split
up.
now,
i'm
not
sure
that
congress
authorized
the
splitting
up
in
the
absence
of
service,
in
the
absence
of
the
presence
of
the
defendants
anymore
than
it
authorizes
the
transfer
itself.
now,
if
the
court
had
jurisdiction,
if
there
had
been
service,
of
course
the
court
may
sever
but
it
can't
sever,
it
can't
transfer,
it
can't
do
anything
with
the
case
except
there'd
be
some
statutory
authority
for
it.
and
this
statute
is
the
only
authority
for
a
transfer.
now,
it's
interesting
--
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
i
would
have
been
delighted
sir,
but
we
were
caught
there
as
to
one
or
two
defendants
and
couldn't
get
away
and
that
it's
there.
i
should
be
delighted
--
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
he
wasn't
asked
to
sir.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
i
was
in
no
position
to
do
it
and
the
plaintiff
never
did
because
the
struggle
has
been
to
maintain
this
inequality
of
distance
from
philadelphia
to
new
york.
it's
further
from
philadelphia
to
new
york
and
from
new
york
to
philadelphia.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
well
if
the
petitioner
prevails
that
this
--
this
--
this
case
to
be
on
recall
now,
it
split
into
two
places.
you
can't
get
it
all
into
one
unless
one
court
or
the
other
will
transfer
it.
and
it's
already
been
held
without
any
appeal
that
some
my
defendants
here
can't
reserve
in
new
york.
that's
what
--
in
philadelphia
i
mean,
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
it
couldn't
be
brought
against
them
all
in
philadelphia.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
oh
yes,
sir.
oh
yes
sir.
it
could
have.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
nobody
asked
the
court
to
transfer
this
case
to
new
york
under
section
1404.
there's
a
very
good
reason
for
that
because
under
section
1404
which
is
in
almost
exactly
the
same
language,
so
many
cases
including
several
in
this
court
hold
that
there
must
be
two
courts
where
there
is
jurisdiction,
its
venue,
the
transferor
and
the
transferee
and
this
court
in
philadelphia
would
have
no
more
jurisdiction
under
1404
than
it
did
under
1406.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
oh
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
section
1404,
convenience.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
yes,
sir.
i
have
under
consideration
we
have
--
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
i
was
suggesting
as
to
the
defendants
that
are
involved
here.
i
am
in
such
position
as
to
those
that
were
served
in
philadelphia
that
your
honors
--
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
no,
sir.
not
--
not
--
not
the
parties
agree
or
the
court
--
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
--
and
actually,
i
proposed
we've
given
no
consideration
with
the
client
but
i
proposed
to
ask
that
the
case
be
transferred
to
new
york.
the
plaintiff
has
a
legitimate
interest
here.
it
wants
its
case
in
its
hometown.
i
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
having
it
in
new
york
because
we've
been
multitudinously
this
rendering,
discovering,
all
issue
but
records
are
there.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
oh
i
think
so,
if
your
honor
pleases.
i
think
they
are.
you
see,
the
--
this
conspiracy
that's
alleged
in
paragraph
7
--
6
or
7
of
the
complaint
says
that
shuberts
brought
pressure
to
bear
on
produces,
to
stay
away
from
this
erlanger
theatre.
i
can't
point
to
any
testimony
that
says
so
except
that
the
producers
are
in
new
york.
that's
--
that's
the
--
the
end
of
the
rainbow
for
all
shows,
broadways
where
they
want
to
be.
and
if
there
were
such
a
conspiracy,
it
must
have
happened
very
largely
in
new
york
that's
where
they
are
and
you
can't
find
them
in
philadelphia.
i've
got
to
try
the
subpoena
and
we'll
take
their
depositions.
but
if
we're
in
new
york,
they're
right
down
in
the
street
10
minutes
subway
ride
or
a
few
course
or
an
hour
of
taxi
ride
and
that
they
have
no
difficult
to
get
them
into
court.
that's
what
i
want
to
do
and
i'm
interested
in
having
the
litigation
in
new
york
but
i
have
a
plaintiff
here
who
brought
it
in
philadelphia
and
has
legitimate
interest
in
wanting
it
there.
that's
what
this
fight
is
about.
and
if
the
plaintiff
has
caught
short,
it's
his
own
fault.
he
took
him
three
years
or
nearly
three
years
to
file
a
cautionary
suit
that's
beyond
my
power
to
attack.
now,
i
took
the
trouble
of
copying
out
1404
and
1406,
they
didn't
print
them
that
way
in
the
brief.
but
if
you
look
in
the
book,
they're
separated
by
about
20
pages
of
citations.
and
so
i
printed
them
here.
i
have
copies
that
the
court
can
have
but
the
court
--
well,
i'd
better
not
try
to
do
that
because
it's
just
for
convenience.
but
if
you
look
at
1404
that
we've
been
talking
about
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
witnesses
and
the
interest
of
justice,
a
district
court
may
transfer
any
civil
action
on
any
case,
but
any
civil
action
to
any
other
district
or
division
where
it
might
have
been
brought.
now,
that
language
has
been
held
repeatedly
to
mean
that
both
courts
have
to
have
jurisdiction
and
venue.
and
on
this
subject
of
part
of
a
case,
it's
very
interesting
to
consider
whether
without
jurisdiction,
a
court
may
divide
or
split
up
a
case.
there
are
good
many
ways
or
several
ways
that
can
be
done.
i've
mentioned
one
by
sending
some
parties
one
way
and
some
others
in
another
but
if
not
infrequent
that
the
issues
are
separated.
liability
tried
in
one
district
or
one
jurisdiction
rather
and
liability
--
i
mean
liability
in
one
trial
and
damages
in
another.
we
have
a
case
--
a
lot
of
cases
in
philadelphia
rising
out
of
--
an
airplane
wreck
in
boston
harbor
a
little
over
a
year
ago
killing
many
people
who
happened
to
live
in
philadelphia.
there
has
been
serious
consideration
of
whether
it
is
possible
to
try
the
issue
of
liability
in
boston
where
multitudes
of
evidence
of
negligence
and
so
on
lie.
and
tried
the
issue
of
damages
in
philadelphia
where
the
parties
lived
and
have
their
earnings
and
so
on.
i
don't
know
whether
that
can
be
done
or
not
but
that
may
yet
reach
this
court.
i
don't
know
of
a
case
where
there's
been
a
severance
like
that
between
districts.
but
here,
the
attempt
is
to
sever
without
any
jurisdiction
at
all.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
(b)
section
of
1404,
there's
a
very
curious
circumstance
there.
1404
(b)
upon
motion
consent
or
stipulation
of
all
parties,
any
action
suit
or
proceeding
or
any
motion
in
connection
therewith
may
be
transferred
to
any
other
district.
the
same
day
that
the
court
passed
1404
and
1406,
it
provided
for
splitting
up
an
action
or
sending
a
motion
or
part
of
the
case
to
another
district.
it
provided
for
that
in
section
1404.
we
are
asked
to
assume
that
it
meant
the
same
thing
when
it
wrote
1406
but
didn't
say
it.
and
i
just
can't
fix
up
that
where
it
has
proper
statutory
construction.
then
judge
moore
in
his
majority
opinion
points
out
here
that
these
sections
are
under
the
heading
in
the
judicial
code,
section
chapter
87
entitled
venue,
venue.
and
when
you
read
section
1404,
it
reads
change
of
venue.
and
1406
cure
or
waiver
of
defects,
we
are
asked
to
construe
that
as
the
meaning
the
cure
or
waiver
of
defects
in
jurisdiction.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
well,
i
certainly
am
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
oh
i
get
a
--
i
get
a
great
deal
of
comfort,
if
your
honor
please.
these
two
statutes
are
in
the
same
language.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
and
the
court
there
was
asked
to
consider
1404
as
a
remedial
statute
and
broadly
construe
it
beyond
the
content
of
its
words.
and
the
majority,
i
think
justice
whittaker
spoke
for
it,
declined
to
do
that.
this
was
a
jurisdictional
statute
and
whatever
jurisdiction
this
court
has
must
be
found
in
that
statute,
not
something
beyond.
that's
where
it
gives
me
comfort.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
oh,
they're
--
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
--
quite
different.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
--
suppose
that
i
have.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
i
see,
i
think
your
honor's
comment
have
been
pretty
much
followed
by
professor
moore
who
says
that
the
rule
might
better
have
been
the
other
way.
well,
that's
not
my
problem
and
my
problem
is
--
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
well,
i
didn't
go
to
him
in
this
case
because
he
doesn't
like
my
decision
and
commented
on
it.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
i
should
like
trace
these
decisions
just
a
little
bit
because
they've
attracted
a
good
deal
comment
here.
your
honors
have
asked
what
courts
have
considered
this
question.
and
my
difficulties
here
don't
approach
those
that
i
had
in
the
second
circuit
because
the
outstanding
decision
there
was,
was
in
the
second
circuit
that
it
reached
the
opposite
result,
and
had
been
so
held
by
a
couple
of
other
torts
including
judge
dimock
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
so
i
went
in
to
the
second
circuit
and
told
them
that
i
did
not
think
that
their
court
had
considered
this
question
but
i
knew
of
no
better
place
to
find
out
and
ask
them.
and
i
pointed
out
some
facts
that
a
great
many
judges
and
presumably
counsel
too
have
overlooked.
in
the
schiller
case,
the
judge
in
a
case
where
there
was
no
service
and
no
jurisdiction
transferred
to
another
district.
and
then
the
amazing
thing
happened,
the
defendant
said,
"i'm
delighted.
you
couldn't
have
served
me
there
but
i'm
glad.
i'll
go
down
there
and
i'll
appear."
and
the
plaintiff
complained.
he
brought
mandamus
to
reverse
that
decision
and
nobody
noticed
that.
while
the
facts
were
that
a
court
without
jurisdiction
did
transfer,
nobody
notice
that
that
defendant
agreed
to
it
that
he
had
the
perfect
right
to
have
cured
any
defects
there
were.
and
it
was
the
plaintiff
who
complained
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
amazement
said,
"why,
who
are
you
to
complain
mr.
plaintiff.
you
in
--
your
just
certs
are
dismissal,
you
didn't
get
service
here."
and
here's
the
defendant
who
said,
"sue
me
over
there.
it's
alright
with
me."
and
we
transferred
it,
"who
are
you
to
complain?"
that's
--
mr.
c.
russell
phillips
the
schiller
case,
schiller
versus
mit-clip.
when
i
went
to
the
second
circuit,
we
had
a
different
array
of
judges
but
they're
quite
closely,
and
they
must
have
discussed
it
because
they
all
agree,
five
of
them
sat
on
this
thing
eventually
and
agreed
that
they
had
not
considered
that
question
at
all.
they
transferred
it
because
everybody
but
the
plaintiff
agreed
to
it.
and
judge
dimock
came
along
a
little
bit
later
and
worked
in
another
case
in
the
district
court
in
new
york,
southern
district,
where
there
had
been
no
service.
he
permitted
a
transfer
but
he
expressly
stated
he
had
a
good
deal
of
misgivings
but
he
felt
he
was
bound
by
the
schiller
case.
then
the
district
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit
followed
and
all
of
these
cases
either
cite
the
schiller
case
as
authority
or
they
cite
a
case
which
itself
depends
in
its
antecedents
on
the
schiller
case.
and
if
you
read
that,
if
your
honor
please
it
did
not
so
hold,
the
second
court
readily
agreed
the
second
circuit
that
it
did
not
so
hold.
so
there
is
not
an
imposing
array
of
difference
of
opinion
here.
it's
true
that
the
district
and
the
second
and
the
fourth
circuit
use
words
of
approval
but
they
always
cite
for
it
at
this
case,
which
does
not
in
--
in
all
fairness
so
hold.
now,
i
think
that
that
is
the
--
the
essence
of
my
argument,
if
your
honor
please,
insufficient
for
this
purpose.
i
think
i
neglected
to
state
that
i
represent
the
two
corporate
defendants
here.
and
mr.
lipper
represents
the
estate
of
marcus
heiman.
i
should
have
started
that
way.
