mr.
hayden
c.
covington
may
it
please
the
court.
this
writ
of
certiorari
brings
before
you,
gentlemen,
a
conviction
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california,
san
diego
division
under
the
selective
training
and
service
act
for
an
alleged
violation
of
the
law
by
failing
to
keep
the
local
board
informed
as
to
an
address
where
communication
from
the
board
would
reach
the
petitioner
here
at
all
times.
the
regulation
involved
is
32
cfr
1641.3,
which
appears
on
page
3
of
my
brief,
the
white
covered
brief
and
it
merely
says
that
a
registrant
should
at
all
times
keep
the
board
advised
of
an
address
where
mail
would
reach
him.
but
an
order
to
correctly
understand
what
address
was
meant
by
the
president
in
the
promulgation
of
the
regulation,
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
consider
section
1641.7
which
appears
in
my
reply
brief,
the
green-back
document
at
page
4,
just
an
excerpt
form,
which
mentions
that
when
a
change
is
made
in
the
address,
the
home
address
of
the
registrant,
not
a
temporary
or
other
place
of
abode,
but
the
home
address
for
the
registrant
notification
should
be
given
within
10
days.
and
when
those
two
regulations
are
interpreted
together,
it
shows
that
it
does
not
mean
any
address
where
the
registrant
maybe
found
but
what
the
president
had
in
mind
was
the
home
address
of
the
registrant.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
that
appears
at
page
4
of
the
reply
brief,
your
honor
and
i
must
apologize
to
the
court
for
not
setting
it
out.
it's
under
roman
numeral
nine,
the
second
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
--
third
and
fourth
line
on
page
4
of
the
green-back
reply
brief.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
this
is
the
excerpt,
the
pertinent
part
which
uses
the
term
home
address
which
shows
that
the
president
had
--
did
not
have
a
meaning
in
mind
of
temporary
addresses
such
as
seaman
and
traveling
salesman
would
use,
but
their
permanent
home
address,
and
that
becomes
important
in
this
case
because
we
have
involved
here,
this
home
address,
is
one
temporary
address,
that
i'll
try
to
reveal
to
you
gentlemen
as
i
proceed
with
the
argument.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
as
i
understand
the
regulation,
if
we
construe
the
two
together,
the
home
address
is
the
one
that
is
required,
but
if
a
man
gave
an
address
where
he
would
actually
be
reached,
that
would
not
be,
i
don't
think,
a
violation
of
the
act
because
it
must
be
given
a
reasonable
interpretation
and
not
one
that
would
work
a
forfeiture.
if
i
--
do
i
make
myself
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
yes.
well,
i
--
i
hope
i
answered
it
that
when
you
interpret
the
two
together,
as
in
this
case,
he
gave
both.
you
see
his
employer's
temporary
address
as
well
as
the
home
address.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
no,
that's
not
my
contention.
no,
i
don't
make
that
contention
justice
whittaker.
now,
the
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
raises
three
points
whether
as
far
as
the
matter
of
law,
the
letter
of
june
7
giving
the
employer's
address
and
the
home
address
in
san
diego
and
the
employer's
address
at
modesto
complied
with
the
regulation,
whether
or
not
also
that
on
june
--
rather
on
february
the
1st,
that
they
alleged
in
the
indictment,
he
actually
was
residing
at
modesto
at
this
temporary
address
given
and
mail
would
have
reached
him,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
actually
under
all
the
circumstances
had
an
unlawful
intent
or
willful
intent
to
violate
the
law
under
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
and
whether
the
evidence
shows
that
it
--
the
evidence
is
as
consistent
with
innocence
as
it
is
with
guilt.
and,
there
is
circumstantial
evidence
involved
in
this
matter
on
one
prong
and
--
we
say
that
the
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
should
have
been
granted
for
that
reason
and
then
we
raise
the
third
point,
which
i
don't
think
i'll
have
time
to
argue,
but
we'll
submit
on
the
brief
and
that
is
the
error
of
the
court
in
refusing
to
give
instructions
45
and
46.
now
the
date
alleged
in
the
indictment
is
february
the
1st.
the
court
should
bear
in
mind
and
i
believe
i
submit
this
with
respect
and
--
but
without
any
authority
to
back
me
up
except
my
own
opinion
about
the
matter
in
reading
the
law
and
giving
it
a
reasonable
interpretation,
in
the
usual
case
for
a
specified
data
is
alleged
in
the
indictment,
we
know
that
any
date
proved
would
be
adequate
as
long
as
within
a
reasonable
date
unless
there
is
a
terrific
variance
that
prejudices
the
defendant.
but
in
the
selective
service
regulations,
each
separate
day
is
made
a
separate
offense
and
there
is
no
continuing
duty
that
can
be
relied
upon
unless
it
is
specifically
alleged
in
the
indictment
as
was
held
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
graves
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
main
brief,
graves
against
the
united
states.
and,
if
we
take
the
evidence
here
as
of
february
the
1st,
it
shows
indisputably
that
this
man
was
in
modesto
at
this
employer's
address,
the
gymnasium
where
he
slept
on
a
cot
from
--
as
his
temporary
place
of
abode
from
february
1st
to
february
8th.
and
if
we
limit
it
to
february
1st,
there's
no
doubt
that
under
the
undisputed
evidence,
the
man
is
not
guilty.
judge
carter,
the
trial
judge
in
the
district
court
did
not
confine
it.
at
first,
he
did
in
the
ruling
on
the
evidence
to
february
the
1st,
but
as
we
got
further
along
in
the
case,
he
broadened
it
out
in
his
charge
to
include
the
entire
month
of
february,
and
we,
of
course,
took
exception
to
that
by
virtue
of
special
request
number
75
which
attempted
to
limit
the
offense
to
february
the
1st
which
he
refused
but
which
we
don't
assign
error
here
because
we
think
as
a
matter
of
law,
under
the
regulations,
this
indictment
and
the
regulations
can
be
interpreted
so
that
it
is
limited
to
february
1st
because
there
is
no
allegation
of
continuing
duty.
in
the
first
indictment
that
was
returned
here,
this
man
was
charged
with
failing
to
report
for
induction.
he
was
never
charged
with
failure
to
provide
the
local
board
with
an
address
until
after
the
third
trial.
the
first
conviction
was
appealed
and
reversed
because
of
refusal
to
give
special
instructions
and
there
were
two
hung
juries
on
subsequent
trials,
judge
weinberger
tried
the
case
twice
and
judge
picard
from
detroit
tried
it
the
third
time
and
finally,
judge
carter
tried
it
the
fourth
time
and
got
hung
juries
on
the
first
two
counts
and
resulted
in
one
conviction
under
this
last
count
of
the
second
indictment
which
was
returned
within
two
months
before
the
statute
of
the
limitations.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
on
a
new
indictment
containing
two
counts
and
the
--
the
old
indictment
--
the
initial
indictment
charging
failure
to
report.
the
first
indictment
was
merely
clear
and
simple
that
he
failed
to
report
on
november
the
8th,
three
trials
on
that.
after
the
third
trial,
with
two
hung
juries,
the
second
indictment
was
returned
with
the
continuing
duty
on
the
failure
to
report
and
the
jury
hung
up
on
that
as
well
as
on
the
first
indictment.
the
only
they
could
agree
on
was
this
second
indictment,
second
count
of
the
second
indictment
of
failure
to
keep
the
local
board
advised
on
february
the
1st.
and
there
was
no
allegation
of
continuing
duty
on
that
second
count
and
that's
why,
i
think,
it
becomes
very
critical
in
this
case
to
confine
this
to
february
1st
in
view
of
the
fact
that
under
the
regulations,
there
is
a
continuing
duty
on
everyday,
and
in
order
to
get
continuing
duty,
it's
necessary
to
allege
it
in
the
indictment
and
they
did
not
allege
it
as
to
this
failure
to
give
notification
of
an
address.
they
confined
it
to
february
the
1st
and
that
was
our
contention,
but
nonetheless,
judge
carter,
as
the
case
progressed
and
as
the
evidence
developed,
began
to
broaden
the
thing
from
february
1st,
clear
to
the
end
of
february
the
28th
and
the
court
of
appeals
seemingly
approved
this
broadening
process.
now,
briefly,
let
me
give
you
the
facts.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
i
objected
to
it
in
the
evidence
there
when
--
on
page
--
i
forget
what
it
is,
when
he
made
his
ruling
but,
then
--
we
had
a
conference
on
the
instructions,
we
didn't
know
precisely
what
is
the
position
he
was
going
to
take
until
finally
the
charge
was
given,
and
we
had
our
request
in
there
asking
it
to
be
limited
at
--
or
--
in
number
75,
asked
it
to
be
limited
to
the
february
the
1st,
because
there
was
no
continuing
duty
alleged
in
the
indictment.
but,
nonetheless,
judge
carter
proceeded
to
broaden
it
out,
and
the
only
exception
we
had
--
have
is
on
our
refusal
to
give
that
request
and
instruction
number
75,
which
we
don't
assign
here
because
we
think
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
can
be
limited
to
february
1st
and
should
be
limited
because
there
is
no
allegation
of
continuing
duty
as
the
court
held
itself,
the
court
below,
in
the
graves
case.
now,
if
i
may
briefly
give
you
the
facts.
when
this
man
rested
he
was
not
one
of
jehovah's
witnesses.
he
did
not
put
in
a
conscience
objection.
he
claimed
to
be
classified
as
i-a.
he
got
classified
i-a.
he
was
classified
iii-a
on
the
count
of
his
father's
disability.
he
got
married
to
his
first
wife
and
in
this
interim,
he
became
one
of
jehovah's
witnesses,
domestic
difficulties
arose,
and
calling
and
bickering
resulted,
as
you
see
in
the
fbi
report
that
was
excluded
from
evidence,
which
is
not
material,
but
nonetheless,
in
this
interim
of
all
these
various
addresses
appear
on
this
cover
sheet,
there
is
one
address
that
was
his
wife's
address
where
he
and
his
wife,
first
wife
lived
together.
all
the
other
addresses
were
his
home
address,
his
parent's
address
when
he
was
living
with
his
parents.
now,
he
was
ordered
to
report
and
this
becomes
significant.
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction
in
1954,
he
reported
and
refused
to
submit.
he
was
given
notification
of
classification,
and
he
took
appeals
from
that
and
exhausted
his
remedies.
now,
this
is
the
first
time.
1954,
he
was
indicted
for
refusal
to
submit
in
los
angeles
and
some
months
later,
the
indictment
was
dismissed
because
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
gonzales
against
the
united
states
about
failure
to
give
the
fbi
and
the
hearing
officers'
report,
and
other
reports
to
the
registrant.
and
after
that,
while
then
the
case
was
reprocessed
within
this
interim,
that
--
this
problem
was
in
the
hands
of
the
district
attorney
and
out
of
the
draft
board
hands,
these
things
occurred.
on
june
7th,
1954,
he
left
san
diego,
his
home
address,
with
his
parents
and
went
to
modesto
to
take
up
working
in
a
gymnasium.
this
man
was
a
physical
coach
or
expert
and
a
weightlifter
and
an
athlete,
and
he
also
was
a
masseur
and
worked
in
this
gymnasium
at
various
jobs
up
in
modesto.
when
he
moved
up
there,
he
notified
the
board
and
this
letter
of
june
7th
which
becomes
very
important.
and,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
letter
of
june
7
on
page
67
of
the
record
and
the
letter
in
substance
merely
informs
the
board
that
there
--
he
is
moving
to
modesto
and
he
gives
his
employer's
new
address
1431
10th
street,
which
is
the
gymnasium,
but
he
repeated
that
he
could
be
reached
within
one
or
two
days
at
his
san
diego
address
and
incidentally,
the
clerk
testified
but
she
knew
that
that
address
on
that
envelope
was
his
home
address
in
san
diego
and,
they
knew
at
all
times
that
he
could
be
reached
there.
he
was
up
there
from
september
--
from
june
7th
to
feb
--
1954
of
february
1955
working
and
sleeping
on
this
cot
in
the
gymnasium.
in
this
interim,
he
was
under
this
indictment
at
los
angeles
and
you
have
to
make
this
250-mile
trip
12
different
times
from
modesto
to
los
angeles
for
court
appearances
and
as
a
consequence,
he
did
such
little
work
that
the
business
went
down,
and
employer
gave
up
to
business
there
of
in
modesto,
and
that
job
played
out
so
to
speak,
and
he
returned
to
los
angeles.
when
he
left
modesto
and
returned
to
los
angeles,
he
did
not
then
notify
the
board
because
that
was
merely
a
change
of
a
temporary
address,
not
his
home
address.
he
worked
in
los
angeles
for
up
until
the
20th
when
he
went
back
to
san
diego
to
help
his
parents
move
from
this
old
address
to
a
new
address
in
san
diego
and
their
street
numbers
aren't
there
and,
it
may
confuse
you
during
this
argument
and
i'd
like
to
give
you
this.
the
first
address,
the
first
home
address
in
san
diego
is
located
on
11th
street
in
san
diego.
the
second
address
in
san
diego
is
located
on
30th
street
in
san
diego.
and,
this
temporary
address
up
in
modesto
where
he
was
working
in
this
gymnasium
was
on
10th
street
in
modesto
not
san
diego.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
modesto
from
los
angeles
is
215
and
yet
another
90
or
100
to
san
diego,
it
makes
about
350
miles,
your
honor.
but
anyhow,
following
february
the
8th,
he
went
to
los
angeles
and
got
into
this
tree
with
a
man
by
the
name
of
beal
where
he
had
a
numerous
temporary
addresses
in
los
angeles
but
did
not
notify
the
board
of
this
change
until
he
went
to
san
diego
to
help
his
parents
transfer
from
the
11th
street
address
to
30th
street
and,
when
he
got
back
to
los
angeles,
he
testified,
he
dropped
the
card
in
the
mailbox
along
with
a
letter
to
a
woman
by
the
name
of
--
who
is
bertha
leonard.
we
brought
leonard
to
trial
and
she
testified
she
received
her
letter,
but
the
board
did
not
explain
what
happened
to
his
letter.
i
mean,
his
card
--
the
government
postal
card
notifying
of
the
change
of
the
home
address
from
10th
street
in
san
diego
to
30th
street
in
san
diego.
anyhow,
in
this
interim
in
1954,
july
1954,
november
1954
to
july
1955,
this
draft
board
file
was
taken
out
of
the
hands
of
the
draft
board
and
sent
to
sacramento
and
then
to
los
angeles
for
the
use
of
--
in
this
prosecution
under
the
first
indictment
that
was
dismissed.
and
it
was
in
this
interim
found
the
file
was
out
that
he
was
in
los
angeles,
changed
back
to
modesto,
and
wrote
this
card,
deposited
it
in
the
post
office,
and
he
had
this
beal
as
a
corroborating
witness
that
he
did
deposit
it
along
with
this
letter
to
this
woman
leonard
in
san
diego
who
--
woman
who
testified
that
she
received
the
letter
but
there
was
no
evidence
of
what
happened
to
the
card.
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
clerk
had
no
independent
recollection
at
all.
she
merely
said
that
she
didn't
find
it
in
the
box
when
the
first
trial
came
up,
which
was
four
years
after
the
letter
was
mailed.
and,
they
made
no
search
in
the
file
to
locate
it
until
after
the
third
trial.
mind
youm
three
trials
without
trying
to
locate
that
letter
and
after
the
third
trial,
the
district
attorney
made
a
--
make
them
search
to
three
out
--
3,000
out
of
14,000
files
and
said
they
couldn't
find
it.
when
venus
went
to
the
board
in
1956,
april
after
the
--
i
mean,
august
following
april
of
1956,
the
fbi
man
came
and
interviewed
at
him
at
his
place
of
employment
in
santa
monica,
in
1956,
april,
and
then
it's
the
first
time
that
he
learned
about
this
order
having
been
issued.
now,
in
this
connection,
we
all
know
that
one
of
jehovah's
witnesses
who
wants
to
exhaust
his
remedies
must
report
and
refuse
to
submit
under
the
espec
decision
to
exhaust
remedies
as
he
had
done
previously.
also,
he
didn't
appeal
from
the
classification
card
showing
that
he
did
not
receive
either
the
classification
card
or
the
order.
now
what
happened
was,
he
didn't
leave
(inaudible)
card
when
he
left
modesto
in
the
post
office
because
he
had
in
mind
notifying
the
board
from
los
angeles.
in
addition
to
that,
everybody
knew
that
he
could
be
reached
in
care
of
his
home
address
and
as
soon
as
he
got
change
of
home
address,
he
deposited
this
card
and
that
becomes
a
question
of
fact
because
his
credibility
was
involved
as
the
defendant
and
yet
he
had
a
corroborating
witness
here,
beal,
as
to
the
mailing
of
the
card.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
yes,
sir.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
never.
there
was
no
tria
--
at
that
time,
the
file,
your
honor,
was
out
of
the
possession
of
the
board.
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
district
attorney
under
this
first
prosecution.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
no.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
there's
no
dispute.
they
don't
contest
that
and
that's
established
by
the
record
itself,
documentary
evidence
introduced
by
the
government.
the
june
7th
letter
was
in
the
file
and
it
was
received
in
evidence
as
a
part
of
government's
exhibit
1.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
there
is
absolute
in
no
contradiction
of
that.
he
was
there
indisputably
until
february
8th
of
that
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
relevance
but
the
court
of
appeals
made
it
relevant
by
their
decision.
they
kept
expanding
this
thing
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
got
it,
they
extended
it
clear
over
until
september
1955.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
sir?
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
the
only
thing
is,
we
prove
what
the
facts
were,
that
he
actually
deposited
the
letter.
we
didn't
want
to
--
we
had
to
develop
that.
that
was
a
part
of
our
evidence
which
he
actually
--
which
actually
had
occurred
according
to
my
understanding
of
the
interview
of
him
and
his
witnesses.
we
didn't
have
any
intent
to
broaden
the
scope
of
the
indictment
by
offering
that.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it's
just
part
of
the
draft
board's
file
--
draft
board
file.
we
didn't
want
to
enlarge
it,
but
the
man
did
actually
notify
when
there
was
a
change
of
his
home
address
in
modesto
from
11th
street
to
30th
street,
then
it
became
his
duty
within
10
days
thereafter
to
notify
the
local
board
which
he
did
within
one
day.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
absolutely
not
one
iota
of
evidence
to
that
effect.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
evidence
showed
it
would've
reached
him
at
either
addresses
on
february
1st,
on
february
the
8th,
and
even
as
far
as
february
the
28th.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
he
was
convicted
under
the
court's
charge
of
failing
to
notify
the
local
board
at
anytime
from
february
the
1st
to
february
the
28th
and
not
keeping
the
--
the
draft
board
advice
of
an
address
where
he
could
be
reached.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
the
indictment
charge
was
on
or
about
february
the
1st,
your
honor
and
our
contention
was
it
should've
been
limited
to
that
because
there
was
no
allegation
of
continuing
duty.
that
was
our
contention,
but
judge
carter
was
the
judge
of
the
court
and
he
took
this
categorical
position.
when
we
started
out
february
the
1st,
but
as
the
evidence
developed,
finally,
it
brought
it
on
up
to
february
the
28th.
and
when
we
got
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
quoted
on
down
to
september
1955
--
18
months.
they
said
that
he
violated
the
law
for
18
months
and
in
this
connection,
if
i
may
just
take
some
time
to
call
your
gentlemen's
attention
to
page
247,
that's
in
the
back
part
of
the
record,
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
where
i
think
some
mistakes
occur
and
while
some
may
be
inadvertent
that's
important.
247,
if
you'll
look
down,
the
left
hand
column
where
you
see
two
i-a's
there
about
the
middle
or
two-thirds
of
that
first
paragraph
it
--
this
last
classification
being
on
september
1st,
1955
following
an
unsuccessful
appeal
to
the
appeal
board,
where
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
didn't
even
appeal
from
that
last
classification
and
that's
an
erroneous
statement.
they
must
have
had
in
mind
the
appeal
before
the
first
indictment
in
1954
so
that's
just
--
it's
probably
an
inadvertent
use
of
the
language
that
the
court
--
the
court
didn't
intend
undoubtedly
to
misrepresent
the
facts,
but
unless
it's
given
its
proper
interpretation,
it'll
get
the
--
the
court
in
a
mistake
here,
page
251,
in
the
middle
of
the
page
where
you
see
that
parenthesized
expression
about
over
one-half
the
way
down
in
parenthesis,
and
this
is
definitely
inadvertence
on
the
part
of
judge
bard
when
he
dictated
the
opinion,
see
letter
attached,
actually
the
record
says,
see
letter
inside.
that's
trivial,
but
be
that
as
it
may,
i'm
not
(inaudible)
the
judges
so,
but
this
court
doesn't
make
that
mistake
either
that
it's
see
letter
inside.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
they
didn't
do
anything,
your
honor,
until
way
in
1956
or
1957.
they
never
answered
any
of
his
letters.
now
the
reason
for
this
--
this
thing
is
a
bizarre
case.
and,
it
could
happen
between
any
registrant
at
any
draft
board
when
you
stop
to
consider.
now
we're
not
accusing
the
draft
board
of
any
wrongdoing.
what
happened
here
was
that
this
man
moved
out
to
modesto
at
his
temporary
address.
he'd
given
this
--
he
wasn't
to
the
lawyer.
he
didn't
know
how
to
write
a
letter
clearly
so
he
gave
these
two
addresses,
the
employer's
address
and
his
own
address.
the
clerk
made
three
--
they
--
they
used
this
file
so
much,
they
wore
out
two
cover
sheets
and
had
to
make
a
third
one
because
the
other
two
were
(inaudible)
from
so
much
handling,
and
as
the
clerk,
that's
her
testimony
and
when
they
made
up
the
second
and
third
cover
sheet,
they
didn't
have
that
warning
flag
“see
letter”
on
the
inside
on
the
front
of
the
second
and
third
one
and
when
she
put
this
order
and
classification
in
the
cards,
she
used
the
new
one
that
didn't
have
this
red
flag
on
it
“see
letter
inside”
that
gave
his
parent's
address
and
as
a
consequence,
the
thing
was
shot
up
to
modesto
where
he
wasn't
even
at
because
the
building
where
he
had
worked,
the
employer
had
vacated,
it
had
been
torn
down,
the
property
integrated
into
an
adjacent
second-hand
car
lot,
and
then
following
that,
that
was
in
april
and
in
october
when
this
no
--
september
when
this
notice
was
mailed,
a
classification,
which
he
didn't
get,
didn't
receive
and
from
which
he
should've
appealed
in
order
to
exhaust
his
remedies
and
would
have
appealed
in
order
to
make
his
defense
on
his
ministry
classification,
nobody
knows
where
it
wound
up
back.
he
left
no
forwarding
card.
his
employer
had
abandoned
the
address.
the
mail
may
have
gotten
in
the
second
hand
automobile
dealer's
possession,
who
didn't
know
him,
and
it
may
have
died
there
as
did
the
order
to
report.
in
any
event,
he
testified
categorically
that
he
didn't
receive
either
one
and
it's
reasonable
to
say
that
he
didn't
because
if
he
had
been
wanted
to
exhaust
his
remedies,
he
would've
appealed
and
he
would've
reported
and
refused
to
submit
as
he
have
done
previously.
everything
corroborates
that
contention
that
he
didn't
receive
it.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
they
never
tried
to
reach
him
through
his
parents
at
all,
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
warren.
the
reason
is
that
nothing
was
returned
to
the
board.
the
board
merely
assumed
he
didn't
get
it.
they
reported
in
january
1956
at
the
united
states
attorney
as
a
delinquent
and
so
no
--
no
action
was
taken
after
that
because
the
board
policy
was
once
it
is
in
the
hands
of
the
district
--
they
don't
do
anything.
he
wrote
two
letters,
one
in
april
of
1956
and
another
one
in
september
of
1957,
which
i
referred
to.
he
reviewed
all
these
circumstances
in
the
letter
to
the
board
before
prosecution
and
they
didn't
answer.
and
much
more
could
be
said,
those
are
the
highlights
of
the
facts
and
gentlemen,
i
would
like
to
reserve
just
a
few
minutes
for
reply,
but
before
i
sit
down,
if
there
is
any
questions,
i
would
certainly
happy
to
answer.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
(inaudible)
finish
in
a
minute.
(inaudible)
to
finish
in
minutes
to
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
on
this
ruling
by
judge
carter
limiting
it
to
february
1st,
or
rather
on
page
92,
you
will
notice
that
when
he
had
made
the
remark
time
to
extend
it,
rather
he
was
trying
to
limit
as
on
our
proof.
we
want
to
get
the
entire
draft
board
file
in
the
record.
and
i
stated
there,
except
for
the
ruling
of
the
court,
i
was
trying
to
get
in
this
september
1956
letter
where
he
was
reviewing
all
the
facts
with
the
board
showing
that
he
had
written
his
letter
from
los
angeles
and
made
these
changes,
and
i
took
the
exception
to
the
ruling.
and
then
later
on,
the
court
says
on
its
ruling
that
what
he
did
thereafter
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
charge
made
as
to
the
bottom
of
page
92.
and
then
--
we
were
then
talking
about
the
august
and
september
letter
of
1956,
i
was
trying
to
get
that
in
evidence
and
that
ruling
was
limited
to
that
particular
point.
now,
i
would
like
to
have
the
court
bear
in
mind
that
this
third
--
when
the
board
mailed
the
card
and
the
order,
the
old
cover
sheet
that
had
this
warning
flag
to
see
the
letter
on
the
inside
that
would
give
the
home
address
had
disappeared
from
the
cover
sheet
because
the
second
and
third
cover
sheet
that
was
used
do
not
have
this
warning
notation
on
it.
and
if
it
had
been
on
the
third
one
that
was
used,
the
clerk
would
have
turned
inside
and
got
the
letter
and
seen
specifically
that
that
had
reference
to
the
parents'
address
because
she
so
testified
that
the
reason
she
put
that
notation
on
the
original
cover
sheet
was
to
remind
her
that
he
could
always
be
reached
in
care
of
his
parent's
current
address,
her
testimony
was
to
that
effect.
now,
the
san
diego
address
on
11th
street
was
current
until
february
the
1st
that
was
home
address
at
which
time
he
--
when
they
moved,
he
mailed
this
card
from
los
angeles,
and
had
corroborating
testimony
but
they
say
that's
an
issue
of
fact
because
of
credibility
and
i
don't
know
that
i
can
strongly
debate
that
unless
i
can
say
that
beal's
testimony
supporting
it
plus
the
receipt
of
the
woman's
letter
would
make
undisputed.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
leaving
the
los
angeles
card
out,
notifying
of
the
change
of
the
home
address,
he
take
the
june
7th
letter
that
gave
the
old
home
address
that
was
good
up
until
the
21st.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
21st
of
february.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
yes,
sir
and
then
the
filling
of
the
forwarding
card
by
the
father
with
the
post
office
would
have
ensured
or
at
least
gave
reasonable
basis
for
the
belief
under
the
bartchy
decision
by
venus
that
the
mail
would
have
reached
him
if
it
had
been
sent
to
that
old
address,
it
would
have
been
logically
forwarded.
another
thing,
the
record
shows
that
in
february,
he's
employer
was
still
in
modesto
and
the
employer
would
have
forward
it
to
the
san
diego
address
to
the
parents.
and
in
--
on
the
top
of
that,
during
this
time,
he
was
out
on
his
bond
in
first
indictment
of
fbi,
the
marshall,
of
the
state
headquarters
of
the
selective
service,
all
communicated
with
him
at
the
san
diego
address
and
reached
him
and
it's
ridiculous
to
assume
that
he
had
an
intention
to
hide
from
this
draft
board
and
deceive
them
about
an
address
when
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
exhaust
his
remedies
by
appealing
if
he
got
it
by
classification
card
and
that
he
have
to
report
and
refuse
to
submit.
it
is
ridiculous
to
assume
that
he
would
have
taken
this
course
of
conduct
and
deliberately
got
himself
beyond
the
reach
of
his
remedies.
much
more
could
be
said
but
the
red
light
is
on,
gentlemen
and
i
submit
the
case
unless
there
are
questions
upon
the
brief.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
your
honor,
no.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
it
--
there
was
no
cross-examination
upon
it
and
i
--
they
have
no
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
--
to
go
into
that
any
further
than
the
filing
of
the
forwarding
card
by
the
father
for
the
family
which
have
included
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
he
filed
a
forwarding
card
with
the
san
diego
post
office
the
very
next
day
after
this
21st
of
february.
the
father
did
in
san
diego.
the
evidence
shows
that.
yes?
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
for
the
family.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
and
the
--
the
mail
would
have
reached
venus
there
but
--
