justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please
sir,
just
for
a
moment?
would
it
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
not
to
have
given
a
home
address
if
nonetheless
he
did
give
an
address
where
the
mail
would
reach
him?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
we'll
that's
what
my
question
is.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
i
want
to
do
is
to
make
it
clear
that
you
are
not
saying
that
the
failure
to
give
home
address
is
a
violation
even
if
he
gave
an
address
where
he
can
be
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
judge
carter
trial
although
was
on
a
new
indictment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
covington.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please,
sir.
why
is
an
attack
made
by
the
board
to
reach
him
by
mail
on
or
about
february
1,
1955,
the
date
mentioned
in
the
indictment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
answering,
are
you
saying
no?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then
the
next
question
is
why
is
there
then
any
dispute?
is
there
any
--
with
that
fact
that
there
was
then
on
file
with
the
board
the
letter
of
june
7,
1954?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
now
you
say,
is
there's
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
he
was
at
the
modesto
address
when
billed
february
8,
1957?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then
what's
the
relevance
about
the
card
and
things
that
happened
on
february
19th,
and
thereafter?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that
was
only
on
the
theory,
wasn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
involved
--
that
involved
another
theory.
that
is
on
the
theory
that
you
were
contending
that
the
letter,
the
card
that
you're
now
talking
about
sent
on
february
19th
was
still
within
such
reasonable
time
after
february
1
as
ought
to
be
considered
to
comply.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
one
more
question,
and
i'm
through,
was
there
any
evidence
at
all
that
a
letter
addressed
to
this
petitioner
at
the
modesto
address
or
the
san
diego
address
given
in
his
letter
of
june
7th,
1954
would
not
have
reached
him
on
february
1?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
have
to
ask
you
one
more
question.
what
was
he
convicted
of?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
the
indictment
charged
in
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
feit
what
is
it
that
if
you
were
to
here
admit
or
admitting
the
trial
of
the
court
that
petitioner
actually
was
in
the
address
given
by
his
mother
of
june
--
december
1954.
if
he
was
there
on
february
1,
1955,
the
date
mentioned
in
the
indictment,
and
continued
to
remain
there
until
the
8th
day
of
february
1954,
if
you
haven't
(inaudible),
do
you
not
think
that
the
defendant
--
the
petitioner
would've
been
entitled
to
an
instruction
of
not
guilty?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
let's
just
forget
for
the
minute
what
the
trial
court
said.
do
you
think
that
the
--
the
man's
actual
presence
on
february
1
and
thereafter
until
february
7
or
8
destroys
a
charge
that
he
was
not
there
on
february
1?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
he
--
that
presents
the
only
question
here
on
certiorari.
the
person's
course
by
actual
introduction
of
evidence,
without
objection,
expand
the
date
alleged
in
the
indictment
as
currently
you
think
--
maybe
the
petitioner
thought
too
at
the
time
he
was
(inaudible)
by
excusing
his
con
--
or
your
conduct
by
mailing
the
card
on
february
22nd,
but
i
wonder
if
that
--
that
acquiescence,
that
trial
on
that
issue
is
enough
here
to
expand
the
indictment's
date
of
february
1
to
include
february
22nd
to
the
whole
month
of
february.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
feit.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
exactly,
is
it
quite
fair
to
say
that
the
petitioner
did
not
raise
in
the
trial
court
the
sufficiency
(inaudible)
of
his
letter
of
june
7th,
1954?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
whole
paragraph
on
page
199?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
--
have
they
had
the
facts
(inaudible)
admittedly
agree
with
you
that
the
evidence,
un-contradicted
evidence
establish
that
on
the
first
day
of
february
1955
and
thereafter
until
it
(inaudible),
petitioner
was
at
the
address
mentioned
in
modesto.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
now
if
that's
so,
then
how
could
there
been
an
issue
of
fact
about
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
let
me
ask
you,
on
--
on
february
1,
the
date
named
in
--
in
the
indictment,
has
there
been
any
change
of
address?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
what
date?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
1955?
