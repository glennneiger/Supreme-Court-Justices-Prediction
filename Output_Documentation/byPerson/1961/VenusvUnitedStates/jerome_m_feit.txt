mr.
jerome
m.
feit
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
jury's
verdict
that
in
february
1955,
petitioner
knowingly
failed
to
comply
with
his
address
notification
responsibility
under
section
1641.3
of
the
selective
service
regulations
and
section
12
(a)
of
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act.
as
we
understand
petitioner's
argument,
the
counsel's
argument
to
the
court
is
in
effect
saying,
put
within
the
factual
confines
of
this
case,
that
even
though
petitioner
left
modesto,
california
in
february
1955
without,
as
the
jury
found,
notifying
his
local
board
of
a
change
of
address
or
providing
forwarding
directions
and
even
though
petitioner's
parents
left
this
old
address
in
san
diego,
and
moved
to
a
new
address
without
petitioner
notifying
the
board
of
that
fact
or
again
providing
forwarding
directions,
nevertheless,
because
at
some
earliest
stage,
he
had
notified
--
gave
the
board
this
old
address
of
his
parents,
he
has
satisfied
the
address
notification
requirements.
we
say
that
such
compliance
is
no
compliance
at
all.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
that
the
general
purpose
of
the
selective
service
act,
the
notification
requirement
being
the
--
one
of
the
most
important
element
as
we
have
set
forth
on
pages
22
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
look,
let
me
say
this
mr.
chief
justice,
in
a
broad
sense,
the
selective
service
act
insofar
as
it
requires
registrants
to
keep
the
board
advised
intimately
where
they're
at
is
the
only
central
list
of
manpower,
which
is
available
to
the
federal
government.
in
this
list
of
manpower
of
all
the
registrants
under
the
1948
act,
other
federal
agencies,
and
i
might
point
out
during
the
second
world
war,
the
war
manpower
commission
made
use
of
this
list
of
manpower,
the
only
list
of
manpower
available.
other
defense
agencies,
other
civilian
agencies
made
use
of
this
--
this
list
and
certainly,
in
times
of
emergency,
it's
not
simply
an
emergency
situation,
it's
not
simply
the
formal
induction
of
a
--
a
registrant
into
the
armed
service
--
services
which
is
the
only
kind
of
problem
which
we
--
we
maybe
faced
in
an
emergency
and
this
court
said
in
the
falbo
case
in
320
united
states,
with
respect
to
the
1940
act
that
it
was
passed
to
help
mobilize
national
manpower.
and
certainly,
in
direct
answer
to
your
question,
yes,
we
think
looking
at
the
overall
picture
that
the
fact
that
the
regulations
specifically
and
repeatedly
notify
each
and
every
registrant,
you
must
keep
the
local
board
informed,
section
15
(b)
of
the
act
specifically
directs
the
registrant,
that
is
set
forth
--
a
portion
of
the
act
which
relevant
is
set
forth
on
page
23
on
footnote
14,
one
of
the
few
provisions
which
thereafter
incorporated
in
the
regulations
that
directs
the
registrant
to
keep
his
local
board
informed
as
to
his
current
address.
and
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
before
i
answer
the
question,
may
i
clear
something
up.
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
the
--
his
obligation
was
during
the
month
of
february
1955
not
february
1st
1955.
i
might
point
out
that
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--
that
in
this
connection
that
petitioner's
counsel
on
page
194
of
the
record,
this
was
the
judge
who
had
charged
the
jury
that
--
that
the
question
for
them
in
the
case
was
whether
petitioner
during
february
1955
had
notified
--
had
sent
this
address
notification
to
the
local
board.
petitioner's
counsel
said
that
he
was
satisfied
with
that
charge
--
with
that
charge.
he
later
--
he
later
noted
that
he
had
also
indicated
there
was
a
--
an
address
--
an
earlier
address
which
he
likewise
rely
upon,
but
again,
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
which
is
--
which
never
challenged,
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
the
requirement
existed
during
the
entire
month
of
1955.
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
think
that
the
essential
element
in
the
case
of
this
sort
is
intent
and
knowledge.
at
trial
petitioner
testified
that
he
had
notified
the
local
board.
he
recognized
this
obligation.
the
jury
found
that
he
had
not
done
this
under
instructions,
which
is
said
to
the
jury,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
local
board
had
received
the
postcard.
“put
that
out
of
your
mind”,
the
court
told
the
jury.
the
essential
question
in
this
case
for
you
to
determine
is
whether
or
not
petitioner
mailed
the
postcard
in
february
1955.
the
jury
found
that
he
had
not
--
had
not
mailed
the
postcard
so
that
in
answer
to
your
question
--
mr.
jerome
m.

the

the
--
mr.
jerome
m.

no.
if
i
may

if
i

the

the
petitioner's
claim
testified
at
trial
--
when
he
asked
by
counsel,
i
refer
the
court
to
page
--
record
at
page
111,
110
as
well,
he
said
that
in
february
--
february
22nd,
1955,
when
he
returned
to
los
angeles,
he
had
gone
to
the
san
diego
to
help
his
parents
move.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
when
he
returned
to
los
angeles
on
22nd
of
february
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--
when
he
mailed
the
postcard.
on
petitioner's
theory
then,
the
local
board
would
have
had
the
obligation
of
proceeding
by
a
trial
and
error
method
in
an
attempt
to
locate
him
and
it
would've
assumed
a
burden,
which
we
think
is
directly
contrary
to
underlying
schemes
of
the
regulations
which
makes
it
clear
that
the
active
cooperation
of
the
draft
registrant,
by
keeping
his
local
board
advised
of
his
current
mailing
address
is
--
is
an
essential
to
the
success
of
the
universal
military
training
program.
particularly,
to
this
argument
--
excuse
me?
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no,
your
honor,
because
we
admit
that
he
left
--
the
testimony
is
that
he
left
modesto
on
february
7,
and
arrived
in
los
angeles
on
february
8.
the
indictment
says
on
or
about
february
1st.
the
trial
court
said
that
the
question
was
whether
during
the
month
of
february,
petitioner
had
notified
his
local
board
of
a
change
of
address.
i
--
i
might
add
that
this
is
an
affirmative
duty
which
is
placed
upon
the
draft
registrant.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
but
--
if
on
--
under
your
assumption
that
the
charge
is
simply
whether
he
was
there
on
february
1,
i
--
i
will
have
to
answer
yes,
but
as
i
said
the
charge
was
even
on
the
indictment
on
or
about
february
1
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
trial
court
broadened
the
charge
to
the
entire
month
and
i
might
point
out
that
his
own
testimony,
he
recognized
that
he
had
this
obligation
by
testifying
that
he
had
mailed
the
postcard.
the
jury
reject
--
rejected
this
testimony
but
from
it,
we
think,
they
could
--
they
could
--
from
all
the
circumstances,
they
could
determine
that
he
had
violated
knowingly
during
the
month
of
february
1955
his
obligation
duty.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
but
--
i
might
point
out
to
the
--
to
your
honor
that
--
the
record
page
253
and
254,
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
the
court
recognized
and
upheld
the
instructions
of
the
trial
court
that,
“it
is
necessary
for
us
to
pass
upon
the
correction
--
the
--
the
correctness
of
such
rulings
and
instructions
when
we
find
no
error
in
them,”
that
is,
as
the
trial
court
have
charged
the
jury
that
the
proof
of
the
offense
at
any
time
during
the
month
of
february
1955
would
support
the
charge
in
the
indictment.
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
--
he
had
never
challenged
as
far
as
--
it
never
challenged
the
trial
court's
determination.
this
was
a
--
this
was
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
affirm
that
determination
and
he
never
raised
this
issue,
i
might
add,
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
nor
has
he
--
nor
has
he
suggested
it
in
any
of
these
briefs
filed
subsequent
thereto.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
may
i
--
may
i
say
this
in

in
direct
answer
to
you
--
to
your
honor's
question?
he
never
urged
this
at
all
at
the
trial.
his
major
burden
of
the
defense
was,
yes,
i
have
the
obligation.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
in
this
case
--
i
think
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
if
i
may
state
some
of
the
factors
upon
which
are
reliable
to
that
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
i
would
say
in
this
case,
in
these
circumstances,
we
think
that
in
the
background,
the
whole
circumstances
in
this
case
by
a
petitioner's
own
testimony,
and
in
line
of
the
june
1954,
this
was
the
permanent
mailing
address,
that
he
had
given
his
board,
was
in
modesto,
california.
from
1950
through
1954,
up
until
the
june
1954,
petitioner
had
notified
his
local
board
of
six
different
changes
of
address.
each
of
which
he
wanted
mail
to
reach
him.
he
had
notified
them
first
in
1950,
again
in
1951,
then
in
1952,
twice
in
1953,
and
again
and
in
1954.
the
san
diego
address
was
the
last
previous
address
he
had
given
his
board
before
he
sent
the
june
7
letter.
now,
this
is
a
hasty
draft
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
i
think
that
what
he
told
the
local
board
was
and
the
letters
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that
is
67
of
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
if
he
went
back
to
that
san
diego
address,
i
would
say
no,
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
in
this
case,
his
parents
moved
in
february
1955
and
were
no
longer
at
that
san
diego
address.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
but
petitioner
never
notified
this
--
never
notified
the
post
office
department,
never
notified,
never
left
forwarding
directions,
and
that
the
stand
that
this
court
said
in
the
bartchy
case
at
319
u.s.,
is
we
recognize
that
--
that
a
draft
registrant
is
not
required
to
notify
his
local
board
of
every
move,
of
every
change
of
address
no
matter
how
transitory
or
permanent
the
move
may
be.
he
can
keep
his
local
board
advised
of
his
current
mailing
address.
this
petitioner
did
during
the
period
of
1950
through
1954
scrupulously
on
six
separate
occasions,
or
he
may,
as
was
done
in
the
recognizing
the
bartchy
case,
have
a
permanent
mailing
address
with
the
board
and
provide
forwarding
directions
so
that
he
can
reasonably
believe
that
mail
sent
to
the
address
he
gave
the
board
would
reach
him
in
time
for
compliance
with
the
broad's
--
with
board's
directives.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
of
course
not,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
of
course
not.
when
you
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i'm
saying
this
case,
and
certainly
in
respect
to
the
question
you
posed,
where
you
have
a
situation
when
individual
travels
around
whether
he'd
be
seaman
or
migratory
worker,
certainly,
his
--
his
obligation
is
--
is
met
if
he
provides
his
draft
board
with
permanent
address
and
like
a
chain
a
forwarding
address
so
that
mail
could
reach
him,
reasonably
expect
that
mail
could
reach
him
at
the
address
that
was
given
his
local
board.
but,
what
we
say
in
this
case
is
that,
petitioner
in
february
1955
which
was
the
crucial
period
charged
in
the
indictment,
either
--
he
was
neither
at
the
modesto
address
nor
was
he
at
the
san
diego
address,
nor
were
his
parents
at
the
san
diego
address.
he,
himself,
testified
repeatedly
at
record
page
111,
when
asked
why
did
you
sent
in
a
change
of
address
at
the
end
of
february
1955,
when
counsel
was
inquiring.
he
said,
because
mr.
beal,
the
individual
he
was
working
in
–
with
in
los
angeles,
mr.
beal
and
myself
were
traveling
from
place
to
place
in
los
angeles,
to
cut
trees
and
we're
moving
about,
and
if
we
knew
we
were
going
to
move,
and
i
knew
that
the
board
had
to
have
a
permanent
address,
so
i
wanted
them
to
have
my
parent's
address
and
by
having
my
parent's
address,
they
could
always
contact
me
by
means
of
my
parents.
now
the
jury,
under
the
instructions,
were
told,
if
you
believe
that
he
mailed
this
in,
you
got
to
acquit
him.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
if
the
jury
was
told
by
the
trial
judge
that
if
you
believe
this
testimony,
if
you
believe
that
the
petitioner,
as
he
said,
mailed
in
an
address
notification
change
in
february
1955,
you've
got
to
acquit
him,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
local
board
received

received
that
change.
mr.

postcard
that
he

has
alleged

that
he
alleges
he
sent
in
february,

yes,
mr.

now,
this
was
a
factual
question.
the
jury
having
before
petitioner's
--
petitioner
evaluated
his
testimony,
functions
which
were
--
which
was
squarely
up
to
the
jury,
decided
that
upon
examination
of
his
testimony,
examination
of
his
(inaudible),
they
weren't
going
to
believe
him,
that
they
weren't
going
to
believe
that
he
had
mailed
in
the
postcard
as
he
said.
mr.
jerome
m.

yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
jerome
m.

i

i

that.
i'm

i
gave
the
misinterpretation.
i
--
i
think
when
--
when
--
let
me
--
let
me
make
our
position
clear.
petitioner's
defense
at
trial
was
that
he
had
mailed
the
postcard.
when
the
judge
so
charged,
as
i
indicated
to
mr.
justice
black,
petitioner
said,
“i'm
satisfied
with
this
charge,
however,
we
make
an
additional
claim.
we
say
that
there's
a
june
7,
1954
letter
which
sufficiently
appraises
the
local
board
that
we
can
--
i
could
be
reached
at
my
parent's
old
san
diego
address
and
i
request
that
the
court
charge
the
jury
that
they
might
consider
this,”
and
this
is
at
page
199
and
200
at
the
record
and
following
this
statement
by
the
petitioner's
counsel,
the
court
so
instructed
and
--
mr.
jerome

yes.
and
--
and
again
on
page
200,
the
court
says
that
if
the
jury
finds
that
defendant
had
at
all
times
kept
the
board
advised
where
mail
would
reach
him,
then
of
course
he
has
to
be
acquitted.
this
is
precisely
our
position
that
this
was
a
factual
issue.
both
issues
were
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
jury
had
before
it
the
evidence.
the
jury
determined
that
he
had
done
either
that
he
had
neither
sent
a
postcard
in
february
1955
nor
sufficiently
kept
the

petitioner
says
in
his
reply

is
a
question
of
law.
he
requested
the

jury

as
well
as
i
would
like
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
the
charge
which
was
on
or
about
february
1st
of
his
failing
to
notify
with
knowledge
the
local
board
of
an
address
where
mail
would
reach
him,
was
enlarged
during
the
trial,
but
to
---
to
include,
it
encompassed
the
whole
month
of
february
1955.
petitioner's
obligation
was
did
he
in
february
1955
fail
in
his
affirmative
duty,
affirmative
duty
of
keeping
his
local
board
advised
of
an
address
where
mail
will
reach
him.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
i
think
it
--
it's
well
settled
proposition
that
on
or
about
a
particular
date,
can
include
a
reasonable
time
certainly
at
to
the
date
mentioned,
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
at
page
256
--
at
254,
at
footnote
5,
the
court
sets
forth
a
number
of
opinions
in
which
that
very
thing
was
held
that
a
variance
between
what
is
charged
in
the
indictment
and
what
is
proved
is
not
material
or
--
or
prejudicial
unless
it
involves
elements
of
surprise
that
would
hamper
defendant's
efforts
to
prepare
a
defense.
but
the
defendant's
--
petitioner's
defense
in
this
case
was
that
in
february
22nd
of
1955,
after
he
had
returned
from
the
san
diego,
after
he
had
helped
his
parents
moved,
that
it
was
at
that
time
that
he
notified
his
local
board.
so
he
certainly
wasn't
surprised
in
his
defense,
he
certainly
knew
of
his
obligation.
he
never
raised
the
issue
in
the
trial
court
as
we
understand
it
nor
in
the
court
of
appeals,
he
doesn't
raise
in
his
petition
for
certiorari.
it's
the
first
time
that
the
issue
is
--
is
made.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
11th
street.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
we
think
in
that
situation,
the
essential
element
of
the
crime
would
not
have
been
proved,
that
is
his
intent.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
and
left
los
angeles
(inaudible)
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
his
testimony
was
that
on
the
8th
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--
he
went
to
los
angeles
and
on
the
19th
he
re

where
he
dangle

became
employed
with
tree
cutting
business.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that
he
only
returned
to
san
diego
for
two
days,
the
19th
and
20th
of
february
to
help
his
family
move,
then
return
to
san

to

to
los
angeles
where
he
remained
for
the
remainder
of
1955.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
and
--
when
he
returned
to
los
angeles,
at
that
time
he
sent
the
postcard.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
for
as
we
understand
his
obligation
under
the
charge
of
the
court
was
he
had
during
the
month
of
february
1955,
to
keep
his
board
advised.
and,
his
whole
testimony
at
trial,
the
entire
testimony
at
trial
was
a
recognition
of
this
obligation,
a
recognition
that
he
had
to
do
this,
and
the
jury
found
that
he
had
not.
he
--
when
he
left
his
parents'
address
on
the
--
on
the
28th
and
returned
to
the
los
angeles
area,
he
was
not
where,
he
said
he
was
in
the
june
7
letter,
either
--
he
was
neither
at
modesto,
california
nor
his
parents'
old
san
diego
address.
they
had
moved
from
that
address.
he
had
not
provided
his
post
office
with
forwarding
directions.
and
this
is
an
individual
who
had
strictly
complied,
six
times
notified
his
board
during
the
four-year
period
would
testify
he
--
at
the
trial
that
he
knew
since
he
had
been
a
registrant
of
his
obligation
to
keep
the
local
board
informed
and
advised
of
an
address
where
mail
could
reach
him.
mr.
jerome
m.

i'm
sorry,
mister.
mr.

well
--
mr.
jerome
m.

no,
on
the
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that's
right.
but
the
--
the
--
in
june
of
1954,
he
sent
a
letter
to
the
board
which
was
received
by
the
board,
he
said
he
was
moving
on
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
he
had
said
that
he
is
moving
to
the
modesto,
california
from
san
diego,
gave
his
modesto
address
to
the
local
board
said
that
he
could
be
reached
within
one
or
two
days
in
his
old
--
at
his
parents'
san
diego
address
which
at
that
time
was
650
11th
street
in
san
diego.
now,
what
i
had
referenced
to
was
his
testimony
at
trial,
that
on
february
22nd,
he'd
returned
from
san
diego.
he
had
helped
his
parents
move
from
the
650
11th
street
to
the
13th
street
address
in
san
diego,
returned
to
los
angeles
and
he
testified
that
on
the
22nd,
he
sent
a
postcard
to
the
local
board
because
he
knew
as
i
read
from
the
record
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
right.
the
--
during
the
month
of
february,
the
february
22nd,
he
had
sent
a
postcard
to
his
local
board
advising
him
of
his
parents'
new
address,
at
30th
street
address
in
san
diego
to
which
they
have
moved
from
the
11th
street
address
on
the
19th.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no.
what
we
think
that
that
letter
of
june
1954
referred
to
is
this
--
says
this
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
we
think
what
the
letter
of
june
1954
was
this,
“i
--
i
am
moving
to
the
modesto,
this
is
my
principal
mailing
address.
this
is
where
i
want
you
to
send
my
mail.”
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
this
is
the
--
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
jury
could
fairly
interpret
that
letter
to
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
we
say
is
that
in
february
1955
he
had
a
duty
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
this
letter
of
june
--
june
7th,
1954
printed
on
the
record,
yes,
was
in
the
file.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that
was
in
the
file,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that's
right.
now,
the
draft
board
testified
that
if
when
she
--
he
--
a
notice
was
sent
to
petitioner
in
october
--
september
and
october
of
1955
to
the
modesto
address
which
was
never
returned
to
the
local
board,
that
she
testified
that
if
that
letter,
this
is
at
that
page
69
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
because
--
because
the
board
thought,
in
light
of
his
past
conduct,
in
light
of
the
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
light
of
the
fact
that
he
had
notified
the
local
board
of
his
current
mailing
address
on
some
six
prior
or
some
five
prior
occasions
during
the
period
1950
to
1954,
that
the
letter
of
june
7,
1954
indicated
or
told
the
local
board
that
his
current
mailing
address
was
in
modesto,
california
and
the
board
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
this
letter
of
june
7
of
1954
was
in
file,
as
i
had
indicated.
but,
let
me
--
let
me
just
state
the
testimony
of
mrs.
haste,
the
draft
board
clerk,
was
in
--
in
september
of
1955,
she
had
mailed
this
one
notice
to
petitioner
at
the
modesto
address
and
it
never
--
it
was
not
returned
to
the
board
although
the
board's
return
address
was
on
the
notification
letter.
again,
in
october
of
1955,
an
order
to
report
for
induction
was
mailed
to
the
modesto
address,
this
again
was
not
returned
to
the
local
board,
and
again
it
had
the
return
address.
now
mrs.
haste
made
clear
that
if
these
notices,
these
letters
had
been
return
to
the
board,
she
would
have
attempted
to
contact
him
at
that
point,
at
his
parents'
old
home
address.
now,
it's
precisely
the
confusion,
we
think
that
this
case
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
we
think
the
board
could
assume
that
because
of
the
--
the
other
proposition
would
be
that
the
local
board
would
have
the
obligation
because
it
had
an
address
on
the
file.
they
had
both
map
in
--
the
modesto
address
and
san
diego
address
in
the
june
1954
letter
to
seek
out
a
registrant.
and
the
registrant
can
say
“well,
i've
given
you
an
address,
now,
it's
your
job
to
--
to
look
me
up.”
the
regulations
make
clear
--
selective
service
regulations
made
clear
that
the
failure
of
a
local
board
to
perform
a
function
which
they
might
have
an
obligation
to
do
--
to
perform
(inaudible)
set
out
at
the
regulation
1642.3
which
says
that
compliance
with
procedures
of
this
part,
not

mr.

that

mr.
jerome

if,
we
think,
our
position
is
that

it
was
his
duty
in
february
1955
to
keep
the
board
advised
of
an
address
where
mail
could
reach
him.
we
agree
that
in
order
to
support
a
conviction
in
this
case,
the
jury
must
have
had
sufficient
evidence
to
find
that
there
was
--
that
the
violation
was
intentional
and
knowing.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i'm
sorry

mr.
jerome

it's
650
11th
street
in
san
diego.
mr.
jerome

tried
to
reach
him
in
september
and
october
of
1955.
mr.

would
imagine
it
was
20
blocks.
mr.
jerome

it's
precisely
our
proposition.
mr.

it's
true.
mr.

mr.

as

the
indictment
is

my
time
is
up.
thank
