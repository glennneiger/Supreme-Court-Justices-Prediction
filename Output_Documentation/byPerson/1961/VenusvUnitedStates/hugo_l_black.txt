if
you
believe,
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean,
a
letter
about
his
parent's
--
addressed
on
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
confused
me
a
little.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you
to
say
that
he
did
leave
notice
for
the
board
that
he
could
be
reached
at
his
parents'
address?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
have
said
that
--
you
didn't
admit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
the
other
was
received
--
that
notice
was
received?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
different
from
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
then
that
it
is
admitted
that
these
was
in
the
record
a
letter
stating
that
he
was
moving
from
place
to
place
and
that
he
could
be
reached
at
anytime
by
sending
a
letter
to
his
parents'
address,
is
that
admitted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
did
it
--
was
the
letter
at
that
time
in
the
file?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
am
simply
trying
to
find
out
what
is,
as
i
understand
it
now,
you
say
that
the
letter
was
there
in
which
he
told
them
he
was
moving
and
moving
around,
and
that
he
--
he
could
be
reached
usually
at
this
address
of
his
parents.
and
as
i
understand
it
now,
you
say
that
that
notice
was
nullified
neither
to
get
(inaudible)
from
him
because
his
parents
moved
10
blocks
from
where
they
have
been
living,
is
that
correct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
not
talking
that
about
february
of
1955.
was
there
in
the
record
in
february
of
1955,
january
of
1955
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
december
1954,
november
1954,
september
1954
and
on
that
was
there
a
letter
on
file
which
told
him
that
he
was
moving
around
from
place
to
place,
and
if
notices,
if
they
didn't
get
him
in
modesto,
they
could
get
him
at
the
address
of
his
parents?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
in
the
file?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
was
there
at
the
time
that
they
indicted
him
for
sake
--
at
--
on
the
ground
that
he
had
not
given
them
sufficient
notice
as
to
where
he
could
be
reached?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
didn't
she
send
one
in
february
or
whenever
this
was,
to
the
place
where
he
said,
“you
could
reach
me
if
you
don't
reach
me
at
the
other
place?”
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
light
of
his
past
conduct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
had
assumed
that
when
the
board
goes
to
look
at
the
issue
of
final
notice
to
base
a
conviction
of
a
man
in
which
he
could
be
sent
to
the
penitentiary,
look
at
his
entire
file
and
(inaudible)
before
they
indicted
him.
and
was
there
in
this
file
a
notice,
that
they
could
have
had
--
could
have
looked
here
where
they
could
have
mailed
it
to
the
address
of
the
parents,
the
venue,
which
i
would
suppose
have
moved
10
blocks
away,
would
easily
the
postman
could
find
them
very
easily.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
made
it
because,
he
had
mailed
in
some
letters
as
she
told
him
that
he
is
moving
from
place
to
place
and
he
happened
to
be
at
place
where
he
probably
was
receiving
those
letters
at
that
time,
the
board
just
assumed
that
they
couldn't
get
him
at
the
address
he
has
said
they
could
reach
him
at
if
they
didn't
get
him
at
his
regular
address.
did
the
board
have
a
right
to
assume
that?
when
he
had
informed
them
that
he
was
moving
around
and
he
might
not
be
reached
there?
did
the
board
assume
merely
because
they
send
him
two
letters
at
that
--
at
that
address,
that
it
was
necessary
to
try
to
get
him
at
the
address
that
he
had
notified
them,
to
try
to
get
him
at
if
they
didn't
reached
him
at
the
regular
address?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
they
--
can
they
violate
a
regulation,
provide
that
if
they
fail
to
--
to
do
--
to
try
to
get
them
at,
at
the
place
that
he
has
told
them
if
they
try
to
get
him,
and
they
by
regulations
say
that
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
neglect
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
enables
them
to
prosecute
him,
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
had
move
from
6
--
11th
or
16th,
that
wouldn't
have
been
his
address
either,
would
it?
