chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
covington,
may
i
ask
you
when
after
the
1st
of
february
1955,
did
the
board
first
tried
to
contact
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
ever
any
contention
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
they've
tried
to
reach
him
through
his
--
through
his
parents
at
his
home
in
san
diego
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
that's
it.
mr.
feit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
government
thwarted
in
its
effectuating
the
act
by
reason
of
what
he
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
can
--
i
can
agree
with
you.
that
i
understand
that,
but
i
merely
ask
you
if
the
government
was
thwarted
in
the
effectuating
of
the
act
by
what
he
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
wondering
if
--
if
he
--
he
had
failed,
as
you
say,
on
february
1st
to
give
this
notice
and
then
some
time,
let's
say
in
june
or
july,
he
had
walked
into
the
--
into
the
office
and
had
given
his
correct
address
and
in
the
meantime,
the
government
hadn't
needed
him,
would
he
still
have
committed
the
crime
in
your
judgment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
say
that
it
in
february
1955,
that
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
it
was
april
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
feit,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
as
i
understand
it
for
the
--
he
registered
in
june
of
1954,
he
had
not,
when
he
registered,
but
i
mean,
he
left
his
address
that
he
said,
“i'm
going
to
--
i'm
going
to
modesto
at
to
such
and
such
an
address
but
you
may
reach
me
at
my
home
address
at
san
diego
on
10th
street.
and
it
will
reach
me
in
a
day
or
two.”
now,
let
us
assume
that
when
this
man
left
modesto,
he
did
go
down
to
san
diego
as
he
--
as
he
stated
to
his
parent's
home
and
remained
there
at
that
10th
street
address,
would
you
say
that
he
had
violated
the
law
to
the
extent
that
you
could
put
him
in
the
penitentiary
for
three
years,
that
he
didn't
--
if
he
didn't
notify
in
view
of
that
letter
that
he
had
written?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
want
--
i
just
want
to
know
if
you
consider
that
that
--
that
is
--
is
punishable
if
he
had
done
that
is
it
--
is
it
a
direct
violation
of
law
for
which
a
man
can
be
sent
to
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
all
i
--
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
--
well,
did
they
put
that
incorporated
in
his
letter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
the
letter
say?
where
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
67?
“at
this
time,
i
wish
to
inform
you
of
my
departure
from
san
diego
to
modesto,
california
because
of
secular
employment.
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
i
have
notified
when
in
los
angeles
after
induction
procedures.
my
new
address
is
same
employer
1431
10th
street,
modesto,
california,
but
can
be
reached
within
one
or
two
days
at
my
san
diego
address.
thank
you,
all
of
you.
i
remain
respectfully,
carlin
venus.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
if
he
went
back
to
that
--
if
he
went
from
modesto
went
back
to
that
--
that
san
diego
address
and
failed
to
give
notice
within
10
days,
has
he
committed
a
felony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
moved
ten
blocks.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'll
tell
you
why
i
ask
the
question.
we
have
--
i
come
from
part
of
the
country
where
--
where
we
have
many,
many
thousands
of
--
of
transient
workers
that
is
--
is
the
--
in
the
fields
and
--
and
they
have
a
home,
perhaps,
it's
in
--
in
oklahoma
or
--
or
arkansas
or
texas
or
some
other
state
in
midwest
and
they
follow
the
practice
clear
of
course
to
the
pacific
coast
and
--
and
perhaps
they
stay
in
no
place
longer
than
a
month,
or
at
most,
six
weeks.
and
i'm
just
wondering
about
those
people,
if
they
leave
a
home
address
and
keep
moving
along,
moving
along,
and
changing
but
letting
them
know
that
in
all
events,
they
can
be
reached
within
one
or
two
days.
i
just
wonder
if
the
law
is
so
severe
that
it
would
remit
a
man
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
doing
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
seem
to
think
that
because
he
had
given
--
he
had
changed
his
address
several
times
before
this
that
that
was
something
against
him,
but
there
are
great
many
traveling
people
and
people
--
people
in
--
in
transitory
business
that
way,
that
pretty
hard
to
--
to
designate
where
they'd
be
except
at
a
home
address?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
during
the
trial
was
it
arbitrarily
changed
to
february
instead
of
february
1st?
could
you
have
said
february
and
march
or
february
and
march
and
april,
or
--
why
aren't
you
confined
to
on
or
about
the
first
day
of
february
as
your
(inaudible)
says?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
if
he
had
left
modesto
and
had
gone
back
to
san
diego
to
the
10th
street
address
where
his
parents
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
11th
--
11th
street
that
--
in
your
judgment,
there
would've
been
no
--
no
crime
committed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
but
now
let
--
let
me
point
this
out
to
you.
he
left
modesto
around
the
7th
or
8th
of
february
and
he
did
go
to
the
10th
--
to
the
11th
street
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
then
helped
them
move
from
there,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
at
least
up
to
--
at
least
up
to
the
time
that
his
parents
moved,
he,
having
been
back
there
at
the
time
--
in
san
diego
at
the
time
that
they
did
move,
he
was
not
violating
the
law,
was
he?
because,
he
had
already
told
them
that
while
he
was
--
he
was
going
to
take
a
secular
job
at
modesto,
he
could
always
be
reached
in
a
day
or
two
at
the
san
diego
address.
so,
if
that
address
remained
until
the
20th
of
the
month
and
he,
himself,
was
there
up
to
the
20th
of
the
month,
or
on
the
20th
of
the
month,
there
would
have
been
no
crime
committed,
would
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
is
that
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
67.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
read
--
read
what
he
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
was
a
matter
of
blocks
away,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
we
can
count
anyway.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
mr.
covington.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
yes
--
no
--
no,
you
--
you
finish
--
you
finish
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
would
like
to
ask
you
just
one
question,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
mail
of
the
--
of
the
parents
was
forwarded
from
their
10th
street
address
to
their
30th
street
address?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
--
they
continue
to
live
there
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
--
oh,
he
did
file
a
forwarding
card?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
--
for
the
family?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
very
well,
gentlemen.
