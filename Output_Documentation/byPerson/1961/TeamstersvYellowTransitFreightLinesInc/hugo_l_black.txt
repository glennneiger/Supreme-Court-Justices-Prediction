justice

why
would
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
that
have
given
you
any
more
right
to
an
injunction
then
it
would've
been
given
on
to
something
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
not
--
do
you
not
still
have
to
meet
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
301,
that
act,
implicitly
repealed
thenorris-laguardia
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
despite
the
norris-laguardia
and
that
therefore
it's
to
that
extent
explicit
to
repeal
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
implicit
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
you
have
to
add
one
clause
to
that
kind
of
--
despite
the
prohibitive
statements
of
the
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
now,
how
could
you
get
away
from
it?
how
could
you
get
away
from
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
to
enforce
the
agreement
by
issuing
an
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
started
after
--
then
you
start
with
it
because
before
that,
you
could
not
possibly
have
gotten
an
injunction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
--
well,
you
couldn't
have
gone
to
the
federal
court
and
you've
gotten
an
injunction.
you
specifically
could've
gotten
an
injunction
in
a
labor
dispute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
the
question
is
whether
this
enabled
you
to
get
an
injunction
in
a
labor
dispute
despite
the
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
is,
it's
still
a
question
of
whether
you
can
get
an
injunction
under
the
--
despite
the
norris-laguardia
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
only
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
agree
--
you
agree
amongst
yourselves
that
you've
got
an
equity
--
you've
got
a
right
to
bring
action,
to
enforce
your
contracts
but
you
disagree
on
whether
or
not
the
norris-laguardia
act
says
you
cannot
enforce
this
by
means
of
an
injunction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
that
is
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
trying
to
ensure
it
like
in
an
injunction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
couldn't
do
it
if
this
other
act
hadn't
in
some
way
taken
the
appeal
or
cut
out
a
part
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
couldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
norris-laguardia
act
doesn't
apply.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
assuming
it
applies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
congress
had
passed
302
(e)
of
the
house
bill
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
have
to
be
here,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
and
that
the
congress
had
passed
that
bill
as
it
was
--
up
to
that
time,
it
would've
said
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
inapplicable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
pass
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
pass
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
they
didn't
pass
it,
did
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
but
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
--
it
was
not
passed
in
the
bill.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
have
(voice
overlap)
--
you're
asking
for
the
benefit
of
that
part
of
the
bill
which
they
wouldn't
pass.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
didn't,
did
they?
they
didn't
and
it
was
the
end
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
it
did
it
by
indirection,
that
implicitly.
