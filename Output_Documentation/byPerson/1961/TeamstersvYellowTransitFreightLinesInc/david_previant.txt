mr.
david
previant
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please?
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
it
presents
only
one
very
simple
question
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
district
courts
have
the
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
peaceful
picketing
allegedly
being
conducted
in
violation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
containing
an
alleged
no-strike
clause
in
view
of
the
provisions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
david
previant
apparently
it
isn't.
there
is
a
great
dispute
between
both
the
practitioners
and
the
theoreticians
on
that
as
a
result
of
this
court's
recent
decision
in
lincoln
mills.
the
--
mr.
david
previant
lincoln
mills
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
this
court
apparently
considered
a
more
difficult
problem
than
the
law
review
experts
have
since.
the
federal
district
--
mr.
david
previant
yes,
i
--
mr.
david
previant
they
probably
still
in
most
cases.
the
federal
district
court
in
this
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
found
that
the
answer
was
very
simple
and
they
held
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
did
not
preclude
the
district
court
from
issuing
an
injunction
under
those
circumstances.
the
facts
too
are
simple
and
in
large
measure
undisputed.
the
petitioner
here
is
the
local
labor
union
in
wichita,
kansas.
the
respondents
here
are
some
six
carriers
of
motor
freight,
common
carriers,
who
are
engaged
in
the
“for-hire
transportation”
of
motor
freight
between
the
states
and
all
of
whom
have
a
terminal
in
the
city
of
wichita,
kansas.
the
employees
of
all
of
these
carriers
in
the
city
of
wichita,
kansas,
that
is
the
drivers
and
the
warehousemen
are
members
of
the
petitioner
union.
the
office
and
clerical
employees
are
not.
the
union
and
the
employer,
i'll
use
the
singular
for
the
sake
of
simplicity,
have
entered
into
collective
bargaining
agreements,
one
which
covers
their
interstate
transportation
of
goods
and
one
which
covers
the
local
transportation
of
goods
in
the
wichita
area.
they
are
known
respectively
as
the
over-the-road
contract
and
the
local
cartage
contract.
these
agreements
are
multi-employer
agreements.
they
are
negotiated
over
a
wide
area
with
many
employers.
it
is
the
identical
agreement
which
was
before
this
court
in
a
different
posture
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
pertinent
to
these
proceedings
are
two
provisions
of
that
contract.
one
is
a
so-called
protection
of
rights
clause
which
provides
that
it
shall
not
be
a
violation
of
the
agreement
if
employees
covered
by
the
agreements
refuse
to
go
through
a
picket
line.
the
second
provision
is
a
rather
lengthy
grievance
procedure.
it
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
strike
or
legal
proceedings
without
first
using
all
possible
means
of
settlement
as
provided
in
this
agreement.
it
should
be
pointed
out
here
that
the
contract
itself
was
in
the
record
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
the
contract
itself
is
not
here
and
this
particular
article
of
the
contract
was
not
unfortunately
printed
in
extenso.
i
say
this
because
there
are
some
suggestion
that
this
contract
contains
as
a
terminal
point,
an
arbitration
provision,
it
does
not.
it
provides
for
a
series
of
appeals
through
the
local
and
area
grievance
committees
which
are
comprised
of
both
employer
and
union
representatives.
it
further
provides
that
in
the
event
of
a
failure
to
resolve
the
grievance
at
the
last
level,
the
parties
may
submit
the
matter
to
an
umpire,
but
the
parties,
both
parties
must
agree
and
if
both
parties
do
not
agree
then
it
provides
that
either
party
is
provided
all
lawful
economic
recourse.
in
other
words,
the
union
could
strike
in
the
event
they
did
not
agree
to
submit
to
umpire
handling.
now
that
particular
provision
is
not
necessarily
crucial
to
the
determination
in
this
case,
but
since
there
has
been
so
much
talk
about
no-strike
clauses
being
quid
pro
quo
for
arbitration
clauses,
i
think
we
ought
to
set
this
picture
in
this
case
right,
that
we
do
not
have
here
a
clause
which
requires
the
union
to
submit
its
grievance
to
arbitration.
the
clause
does
require
the
union
to
submit
to
an
arbitration
or
rather
a
grievance
procedure.
mr.
david
previant
the
--
only
a
part
of
the
clause
was
printed
in
the
record.
i
don't
think
that
counsel
would
differ
with
me
as
to
what
i
say
that
the
clause
does
not
require
arbitration.
i
say
that
the
contracts
were
in
the
record
in
the
court
below.
they
were
physically
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
preparing
this
record,
unfortunately,
there
was
some
reference
only
to
the
contract
as
it
appeared
in
the
findings
and
therefore
the
entire
article
was
not
printed.
mr.
david
previant
there
is
no
objection
at
all.
i
would
be
very
pleased
to
submit
the
contracts
to
the
court
immediately
upon
the
conclusion
of
the
case
today.
mr.
david
previant
thank
you.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
yes,
they
--
and
the
grievance
procedure
clause
is
essentially
identically
the
same
as
the
record
[inaudible].
well,
in
july
of
1959,
during
the
life
of
this
contract,
the
union
decided
that
it
wanted
to
organize
the
unorganized
office
and
clerical
employees
of
the
employers
with
whom
it
had
this
contract.
accordingly,
a
letter
was
sent
to
the
employers.
the
letter
advised
the
employers
of
the
union's
interest
in
the
--
in
the
office
and
clerical
employees.
it
stated
among
other
things
that
to
induce
your
employees
to
join
this
union,
we
shall
picket
your
establishment
on
or
about
the
27th
of
july,
stated
among
other
things
and
engaging
in
this
picketing
campaign
we're
speaking
for
the
members
of
our
organization
who
are
employed
in
businesses
like
yours
and
who
feel
the
brunt
of
unfair
competition
of
your
unorganized
employees.
the
letter
did
emphasize
that
it
had
no
quarrel
or
dispute
with
the
employer.
it
was
making
no
demands
upon
the
employer.
the
letter
acknowledged
that
until
such
time
as
the
union
obtained
the
majority
representation
status,
it
could
not
make
any
such
demands
upon
the
employer
for
recognition.
thereafter,
within
several
days,
the
picketing
started.
picket
signs
said
merely
organize.
they
urged
the
office
employees
of
this
terminal
to
join
teamsters
union
local
795.
this
picketing
was
peaceful
at
all
times.
drivers
who
were
members
of
the
union
and
employed
at
these
terminals
upon
approaching
the
picket
line
and
identifying
it
as
a
picket
line,
established
by
their
local
union,
or
other
members
of
teamsters
unions
in
other
parts
of
the
country
who
might
had
been
interchanging
freight
at
these
terminals
refused
to
go
through
these
picket
lines.
members
of
the
union
refused
to
work
behind
the
picket
line.
the
result
was
of
course,
the
business
being
conducted
by
these
employers
at
these
terminals
was
disrupted.
for
all
practical
purposes,
i
guess
the
record
would
permit
of
a
conclusion
that
it
was
just
as
though
their
employees
had
gone
out
on
a
direct
strike.
an
ex
parte
restraining
order
was
entered
by
the
district
court
upon
application
of
the
employers.
the
union
was
restrained
from
violating
the
existing
contract,
from
picketing
in
the
premises
of
the
employer
and
from
otherwise
tying
up
the
operation.
i
think
it
is
important
to
emphasize
here
also
that
the
employers
in
presenting
their
petition
to
the
district
court
made
no
claim
that
this
was
a
matter
which
was
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure.
they
did
not
ask
that
the
matter
be
submitted
to
the
grievance
procedure.
they
did
not
ask
for
arbitration.
on
the
contrary,
their
theory
was
that
there
was
absolutely
no
dispute
between
the
employers
and
the
unions.
there
was
no
grievance
and
that
accordingly,
the
union's
activity
was
in
violation
of
the
provision
of
the
contract
which
said
there
shall
be
no
strike
until
all
means
the
settlement
have
been
exhausted.
the
union
of
course
denied
that
its
activities
constituted
a
breach
of
the
contract
and
it
challenged
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
court
under
the
norris-laguardia
act.
after
a
hearing
on
a
permanent
injunction,
the
court
found
that
the
picketing
had
caused
a
concerted
stoppage,
that
the
stoppage
was
a
strike.
that
there
was
no
controversy
between
the
union
and
the
employers
that
the
picketing
which
caused
the
strike
was
in
violation
of
the
contract,
that
the
picket
line
clause
upon
which
the
union
relied
was
not
applicable,
that
the
court
did
have
jurisdiction
under
the
norris-laguardia
act
because
in
the
lower
court's
opinion,
the
suit
does
not
involve
or
grow
out
of
a
labor
dispute.
and
a
permanent
junction
enjoined,
restrained
and
prohibited
the
union
and
its
officers
from
violating
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
engaging
in
picketing
activity.
when
no
labor
dispute
is
dissolved
--
is
involved
and
which
causes
its
members
to
engage
in
a
concerted
stoppage
or
interruption
of
the
work.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
confirmed.
it
found
that
there
was
a
breach
of
contract,
that
these
activities
did
violate
the
contract.
it
further
found
that
although
the
controversy
might
come
within
the
literal
reading
of
norris-laguardia,
but
nevertheless,
the
jurisdictional
limitations
found
in
norris-laguardia
must
now
be
read
in
light
of
the
provisions
of
section
301
of
the
subsequent
taft-hartley
enactment
and
found
that
the
policy
expressed
in
301
would
confer
upon
the
courts
a
jurisdiction
to
restrain
a
violation
of
the
contract
even
though
it
involved
picketing
and
strikes.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
--
did
not
concur
in
the
finding
that
there
was
no
labor
dispute,
but
found
that
301
nevertheless
superseded
or
repealed
or
had
to
be
accommodated
to
the
norris-laguardia
and
that
in
breaking
that,
the
combination
or
comparison,
there
was
a
legislative
intent
to
carve
this
kind
of
strike
and
picketing
from
under
what
had
previously
been
the
hospitable
scope
of
norris-laguardia.
this
opinion
of
the
court
--
mr.
david
previant
i'm
--
i
didn't
hear
the
last
sentence
--
mr.
david
previant
i
can't
speak
for
counsel.
i
think
that
the
courts
below
would
have
agreed
that
it
was
and
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
the
court
below
find
--
i
think
probably
so.
mr.
david
previant
i
would
amend
that
answer.
i
believe
that
the
district
court
just
didn't
believe
that
this
came
within
the
definition
of
the
labor
disputes.
mr.
david
previant
that's
correct.
mr.
david
previant
well,
it
appeared
that
literally
it
would
be
and
nevertheless
the
policy
expressed
in
301
to
make
a
difference.
mr.
david
previant
we
believe
that
that
is
an
incontrovertible
assumption
--
mr.
david
previant
--
under
the
definitions
of
the
act
and
then
the
cases
under
the
act.
i
point
out
at
this
point
that
three
courts
of
appeal,
the
first,
second,
and
the
seventh
had
concluded
other
than
the
court
of
appeal
for
tenth,
all
of
them
after
examining
the
legislative
history
of
301
concluded
that
there
just
was
no
need
for
accommodation,
no
need
to
find
an
implied
repeal,
that
important
legislation
such
as
the
norris-laguardia
act
which
has
been
ever
in
the
consciousness
of
congress,
certainly
if
it
were
to
be
repealed,
there
would've
been
some
explicit
language
so
indicating.
mr.
david
previant
the
only
circuit
that
has
is
fifth
circuit,
the
first,
the
second
and
the
seventh.
mr.
david
previant
have
--
mr.
david
previant
the
bull
case
is
in
the
second,
mead
case
in
the
first
and
sinclair
refining
in
the
seventh.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
it
could
be
best
summarized
that
they
believe
that
301
does
not
touch
section
4
rights.
whatever
other
effect
301
may
have
had
upon
other
injunctions
or
restraining
orders
which
might
appear
to
come
within
the
literal
language
of
norris-laguardia,
i
think
they
have
accepted
the
holding
of
this
court
that
301
creates
substantive
law.
mr.
david
previant
we
don't
believe
so.
certainly,
under
the
words
of
norris-laguardia
that
appears
to
deal
with
jurisdiction,
we
think
that's
the
subsequent
construction
of
norris-laguardia
by
this
court
would
indicate
that
it
is
also
a
--
mr.
david
previant
--
legislation
of
substance
rather
than
a
procedure.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
that
they
accept
the
latter
that
norris-laguardia
--
mr.
david
previant
no.
no,
i
misconceived
your
question,
i'm
sorry.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
--
that
they
has
taken
that
position.
i
think
they
have
taken
the
simple
position
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
injunctions
like
requiring
an
employer
to
arbitrate,
requiring
an
employer
to
bargain
with
the
unions
under
the
railway
labor
act,
requiring
a
union
to
cease
discriminating
against
its
members
because
of
race.
that
while
these
types
of
restraining
orders
are
mandatory
injunctions,
although
they
might
come
within
the
literal
terms
of
norris-laguardia,
were
not
contemplated
by
norris-laguardia,
and
therefore,
the
court
would
not
have
to
apply
the
stringent
requirements
of
norris-laguardia
in
testing
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
previant
no.
in
order
to
come
to
the
result
of
301,
they
tried
to
make
what
this
court
has
called
an
accommodation
with
the
norris-laguardia
act.
they
feel
that
this
was
not
the
abuse,
the
type
of
things
which
i
have
enumerated.
they
feel
are
not
the
kind
of
an
abuse
which
was
contemplated
in
the
enactment
of
norris-laguardia,
but
that
norris-laguardia
stands
unchanged
insofar
as
basic
section
4
rights
are
concerned,
the
right
to
picket,
the
right
to
strike
directed
into
--
this
other.
mr.
david
previant
i
believe
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
except
for
the
area
which
is
indicated
by
301,
they
believe
that
the
congressional
intention
was
clear
that
301
would
not
touch
norris-laguardia.
they
do
not
rely
upon
301
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
norris-laguardia
and
particularly
the
section
4
rights
maintain
their
[inaudible]
mr.
david
previant
well,
insofar
as
the
opinion
might
reflect
the
process
to
which
these
courts
have
gone
through,
they
have
first,
i
believe,
laid
norris-laguardia
down
next
to
the
facts
and
they
have
said
that
this
is
clearly
a
norris-laguardia
case.
they
have
then
said
in
view
of
the
determination
made
by
this
court
in
lincoln
mills,
we
now
must
consider
whether
congress
in
saying
that
these
contracts
shall
be
enforceable
in
a
court
of
law
intended
to
sap
norris-laguardia.
i
think
that
is
the
process
which
they
go
through
and
that's
probably
what
the
decisions
would
indicate,
what
the
opinions
would
indicate.
in
all
of
these
cases,
there
was
no
real
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
labor
dispute.
there
was
no
real
dispute
as
to
what
the
result
may
have
been
or
could
have
been
absent
to
301.
mr.
david
previant
prior
to
301,
norris-laguardia
did
cover
it.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
there
is
no
dispute.
mr.
david
previant
well,
in
these
cases,
the
railway
labor
act
would
have
no
bearing.
mr.
david
previant
well,
we
just
have
the
norris-laguardia
and
301,
we
don't
have
no
--
mr.
david
previant
alright.
i
would,
in
view
of
our
discussion,
just
past,
overheard
either
fact
that
the
dispute
demonstrates
the
--
all
of
the
practical
accouterments
of
a
labor
dispute
under
norris-laguardia
both
the
dispute
between
the
organized
and
the
unorganized
employees
and
people
in
the
same
industry
and
i
would
pass
on
to
--
and
i
would
pass
also
the
point
that
the
injunction
clearly,
clearly
restrains
the
exercise
of
rights
which
under
section
4
was
--
were
too
at
that,
complete
immunity
under
any
view
of
norris-laguardia
providing
there
is
a
labor
dispute.
i
would
also
pass
over
rather
hurriedly
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
norris-laguardia
did
apply
in
the
past
to
contract
violations.
we
have
set
forth
the
conclusion
in
our
brief
that
the
united
mine
workers
case
is
a
clear
example
of
the
attempted
application
of
norris-laguardia
to
a
dispute
involving
a
breach
of
contract
and
although
the
decision
of
the
court
was
not
in
harmony
in
the
case,
certainly
i
believe
all
of
the
justices
who
participated
in
that
case
felt
that
this
was
a
norris-laguardia
case.
the
other
question
was
whether
or
not
it
applied
to
the
government.
i
think
that
we
then
get
to
the
point
which
one
of
our
brothers
mentioned
this
morning,
since
the
lower
court
looks
to
section
301
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
any
erosion
on
norris-laguardia.
we
look
at
the
statute
on
its
face
and
see
what
the
comfort
we
can
get
from
examining
that.
we
believe
that
the
examination
of
the
statute
itself
demonstrates
that
congress
knew
what
it
was
about,
that
what
it
intended
to
repeal
or
set
aside
the
application
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
it
did
so
specifically
and
unequivocally
and
that
we
would
conclude
from
that
that
any
other
provision
of
the
act
that
which
congress
did
demonstrate,
this
intention,
if
it
intended
clearly
that
norris-laguardia
act
shall
continue
to
apply.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
the
secondary
boycott
provision
for
example,
the
taft-hartley,
is
--
provides
that
it
--
in
fact
provides
mandatorily
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
shall
after
investigation
and
upon
concluding
that,
there
is
a
violation
of
the
act,
go
into
the
federal
district
court.
it
provides
as
to
on
a
provisions
of
the
taft-hartley
act
that
it
has
the
discretionary
power
to
go
into
the
district
court
upon
a
finding
or
a
belief
that
there
is
a
violation
and
we
find
a
specific
provision
that
in
exercising
either
the
mandatory
or
the
discretionary
power
to
go
to
the
district
courts
for
relief
from
alleged
violations
of
these
particular
provisions
of
the
act
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
is
not
to
be
limited
by
the
norris-laguardia
act,
the
specific
provision
so
holding.
then
we
--
we
get
to
the
national
emergency
provisions
and
we
find
similarly
that
after
the
procedures
that
are
required
under
the
national
emergency
provisions
had
been
exhausted,
there
may
be
an
injunction
for
a
limited
period
of
time
and
again
a
specific
provision
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
shall
not
apply
in
the
application
for
such
injunction
against
the
national
emergency
strike.
the
taft-hartley
act
further
has
a
provision
in
connection
with
trustee
funds
that
in
the
event
there's
been
a
violation
of
that
section
and
section
302,
then
there
may
be
a
restraining
order
applied
for
it
issued
in
the
federal
district
court
and
again,
expressly
stating
without
regard
to
the
norris-laguardia
act.
i
must
note
it
that
in
each
instance,
the
government
is
the
party
and
not
the
private
party,
except
in
the
last
instance
which
is
not
really
a
dispute
kind
of
a
situation
and
we
believe
that
this
demonstrates
a
considered
congressional
judgment
that
if
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
to
be
set
aside
in
any
way
or
in
any
manner,
it
would
be
done
only
under
limited
circumstances
and
it
would
be
done
specifically.
we
also,
certainly
on
the
case
of
this
evidence,
would
have
to
conclude
that
we're
not
dealing
with
one
of
those
statutes
that
one
of
the
courts
referred
to
as
obscure
or
generally
forgotten
so
that
we
might
loosen
up
on
our
application
of
a
rule
of
--
still
by
implication
but
this
was
certainly
a
statute
which
was
foremost
in
the
minds
of
the
congress
in
revising
the
wagner
act
of
1947.
that
appears
on
the
face
of
the
statute
itself.
then
move
to
the
other
handy
like
tool
for
interpretation
and
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
again
we
find
that
there
was
in
the
legislative
history
attempts
made
to
relax
the
provisions
of
norris-laguardia
particularly
in
contract
violation
cases.
that
history
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
that
history
incidentally
is
set
forth
in
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
appendix
to
his
opinion
in
the
lincoln
mills
case.
what
it
shows
is
that
the
house
bill
3020
provided
specifically
that
a
suit
for
a
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
could
be
brought
in
the
federal
district
court
and
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
specifically
by
title
would
not
apply.
the
senate
approach
and
this
was
a
problem,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
lincoln
mills
decision,
this
problem
of
adherence
to
contract,
the
senate
approach
was
that
in
the
event
--
that
a
contract
violation
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
would
be
subject
to
adjudication
by
the
courts
and
then
--
but
then
normally
follow
that
under
its
discretionary
power,
if
and
so
that
a
particular
contract
violation
created
some
situation
was
--
which
would
require
action,
it
could
then
go
under
the
discretionary
injunction
procedure
and
the
norris-laguardia
would
not
apply
in
that
instance.
these
two
differences
among
others
have
to
go
to
conference.
and
when
that
came
out
of
conference,
conference
report
repeated
the
fact
that
3020
has
specifically
set
aside
norris-laguardia
and
that
the
senate
version
did
not,
but
it
went
on
to
say
we
have
retained
only
part
of
that
provision
and
the
only
part
that
was
retained
was
a
provision
that
would
set
aside
section
6
of
norris-laguardia
which
imposed
a
rather
strict
test
that
this
court
will
recall
on
imposing
liability
upon
unions
for
acts
of
their
agents.
this
is
all
that
came
out
of
the
legislative
bill
with
respect
to
norris-laguardia
and
they
said
that
they
would
then
leave
the
enforcements
of
contracts
to
the
normal
judicial
processes.
mr.
david
previant
well,
301
was
initially
put
into
the
statute
at
this
time,
in
the
taft-hartley
amendments.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
think
that
301
grew
out
of
this.
again,
there
was
no
parallel
provision
in
the
law
as
it
existed.
the
law
was
going
through
this
very
extensive
overhaul
because
of
a
feeling
that
it
had
been
one
sided
--
mr.
david
previant
--
and
that
there
had
not
been
enough
limitation
placed
upon
the
activities
of
labor
unions.
one
of
the
limitations
which
was
desired
at
that
time
or
rather
one
of
the
impositions
which
was
required
--
was
desired
was
that
both
management
and
labor
be
held
to
the
contract
and
the
house
version
and
the
senate
version
were
the
respective
approaches
to
that
particular
problem.
they
merged
in
what
is
now
301.
mr.
david
previant
well
--
mr.
david
previant
it
seems
to
me
that
that
was
the
test
which
this
court
set
itself
to
in
the
lincoln
mills
case.
mr.
david
previant
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
anything
in
the
legislative
history
which
would
so
indicate.
mr.
david
previant
certainly,
i
believe
that
this
court,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions
canvass
that
history
very
thoroughly
in
the
lincoln
mills
case.
i
think
that
the
debates,
however,
in
addition
to
the
--
what
finally
happened
to
the
senate
and
the
house
version,
the
debates
themselves
i
think
are
clarifying
and
that
you
had
repeatedly
a
statement
by
senator
taft,
by
senator
ellender,
by
senator
thomas
among
others.
i
think
they
knew
what
kind
of
a
political
hornet's
nest
was
involved
in
trying
to
do
violence
bodily
to
all
of
norris-laguardia.
and
they
constantly
said
that
they
were
not
doing
anything
to
norris-laguardia
in
their
adoption
of
these
amendments.
mr.
david
previant
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
previant
they
went
further.
they
said,
where
we
did
in
terms,
we
did
it
in
the
--
in
such
a
posture
so
that
it
would
be
the
government
after
investigation
which
would
be
going
into
the
federal
district
courts
and
so
we
have
eliminated
substantially
the
evil
which
was
intended
upon
the
promiscuous,
if
i
may
use
that
term,
issuance
of
injunctions
prior
to
1932,
but
they
said
and
realizing
i
believe
the
--
i
think
that
193
--
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
had
accomplished
what
its
authors
had
hoped
it
would
accomplish
and
that
even
those
who
opposed
it
at
that
time
had
accepted
it
as
good
law
for
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
there
would
be
no
question
--
mr.
david
previant
--
under
the
national
emergency
provision.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
and
i
wouldn't
--
i
would
think
there
may
be
elements
of
this
controversy
which
might
have
fallen
within
other
provisions
of
the
taft-hartley
act
which
might
have
enabled
the
labor
board
to
come
in.
particularly,
have
in
mind
the
recent
amendments
on
organizational
picketing
without
suggesting
that
this
would've
fallen
within
that
language.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
while
i
am
on
that
subject,
i
think
it
might
be
well
to
point
out
that
there
were
always
instances
under
norris-laguardia
when
it
was
felt
that
the
result
was
harsh.
people
perhaps
weren't
looking
to
the
policy
of
the
act
and
that
is
to
get
the
federal
courts
out
of
the
injunction
business,
but
they
thought
that
there
was
a
harsh
result
and
added
pressure
with
respect
to
those
harsh
results
build
up,
you
did
get
amendments
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
meet
that,
the
secondary
boycott,
the
jurisdictional
dispute,
those
things
where
they
felt
that
it
was
unfair
that
there
was
no
way
of
getting
relief
in
the
federal
courts,
all
of
those
things
that
congress
eventually
caught
up
with.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
yes
it
did
in
connection
with
--
mr.
david
previant
no.
i
did
not
say
that,
certainly
not.
it
said
under
those
instances
where
there
may
be
one
that
will
ever
go
to
avoid
strict
standards.
the
legislative
history,
we
are
satisfied
just
would
not
support
a
finding
that
such
an
important
and
controversial,
at
least
initially
controversial
piece
of
litigation
like
norris-laguardia
was
amended
sub
silentio
or
pro
tanto
or
by
implication
because
the
congress
was
constantly
aware
of
the
existence
of
norris-laguardia
and
problems
under
it.
but
when
it
adopted
301,
even
though
there
had
been
the
proposals
which
(a)
would've
either
brought
the
contract
violation
cases
under
norris-laguardia
--
in
the
federal
courts
without
regard
to
norris-laguardia
or
would've
permitted
the
labor
board
to
go
to
the
federal
courts
without
regard
to
norris-laguardia.
they
finally
wound
up
with
the
simple
statement
that
the
federal
courts
could
--
that
suits
for
violation
of
contract
could
be
entertained
by
the
federal
courts
regardless
of
residence
and
regardless
of
the
jurisdictions
involved.
the
problems
that
have
arisen
in
connection
with
norris-laguardia
bear
not
only
upon
whether
or
not
301
has
--
made
the
breach,
but
whether
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
what
is
known
as
the
chicago
river
case,
a
breach
maybe
made.
i
would
recall
to
this
court
and
in
the
chicago
river
case,
it
dealt
with
the
problem
under
the
railway
labor
act,
it
was
a
--
what
is
called
a
minor
dispute.
it
involved
grievances
which
were
then
before
the
board,
the
national
railway
adjustment
board
which
had
been
created
by
the
congress
to
handle
minor
disputes.
nevertheless,
a
strike
to
hurry
up
the
board
i
suppose
took
place
and
a
question
arose
whether
or
not
under
norris-laguardia
that
particular
strike
could
be
restrained.
this
court
held
it
did,
but
it
did
so
upon
the
peculiar
and
unique
history
of
the
railway
labor
act,
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
adopted.
the
agreement
of
all
of
the
parties,
both
those
who
favored
it
and
those
who
were
opposed
to
it
that
the
congress
was
actually
imposing
compulsory
arbitration
in
the
railroad
industry
in
cases
of
contract
interpretation
grievances
and
a
specific
provision
and
subsequently,
the
court
in
explaining
it,
i
think
made
it
clear
that
they
were
dealing
with
a
particular
industry
as
distinguished
from
industry
in
general,
a
particular
legislative
act
as
distinguished
from
the
general
act
and
found
that
there
was
just
no
basis
for
a
holding
that
to
restraint
this
strike
under
this
law
would
cause
a
breach
in
norris-laguardia.
now
we
suggest
that
the
differences
here
are
manifested.
we
have
here
--
and
in
the
railway
labor
act,
you
had
a
complete
absence
of
history
with
respect
to
what
was
intended
with
regard
to
norris-laguardia
and
that
is
why
the
court
was
confronted
with
this
problem
of
accommodation.
here
in
the
face
of
the
history
which
i
had
just
recited
briefly,
it
would
seem
that
there
is
no
room,
there
is
no
requirement
that
an
effort
be
made
to
accommodate.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
a
case
where
we
act
--
we
are
at
a
loss
with
respect
to
congressional
policy
because
we
say
the
statute
on
its
face
and
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
whatever
erosions
or
intrusions
or
inroads
into
norris-laguardia
were
going
to
be
made,
were
being
made
specifically
and
in
a
very
limited
fashion.
and
i
don't
believe
that
on
the
basis
of
that
kind
of
a
showing,
we
can
assume
that
other
erosions
were
made
that
were
not
referred
to.
there
are
other
cases
which
this
court
considered,
i
believe
in
lincoln
mills
in
which
what
appeared
to
be
an
injunction
covered
by
the
literal
language
of
norris-laguardia
was
held
not
to
be
and
these
other
railway
cases
to
which
i
referred
earlier.
there
of
course
what
the
court
was
trying
to
do
was
to
accommodate
the
legislative
declaration
as
to
the
requirement
of
the
railway
employer
to
bargain,
to
require
labor
unions
to
represent
their
members
fairly.
it
found
that
the
kind
of
injunction
that
was
considered
was
not
the
kind
of
injunction
which
was
before
the
congress
when
norris-laguardia
was
being
discussed
and
found
that
the
section
7
test
were
clearly
in
apposite
and
therefore
concluded
that
there
would
be
no
erosion,
there
would
no
interference
with
norris-laguardia,
there'd
be
no
violation
of
norris-laguardia
act
in
the
event
that
injunctions
were
issued
in
those
cases,
i
would
--
i
would
emphasize
here
as
distinguished
from
lincoln
mills
and
the
other
railroad
cases
other
than
the
chicago
river
case
that
we
are
dealing
with
that
kind
of
act
which
under
section
4
of
norris-laguardia
is
not
to
be
restrained
in
any
way.
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
of
course
norris-laguardia
does
not
inhibit
the
federal
courts
from
exercising
jurisdiction
in
all
labor
dispute
cases.
that
is
so,
but
it
does
say
to
the
federal
court
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
particular
kinds
of
activities
which
are
peaceful,
non-violent,
non-fraudulent,
picketing
and
inducing
their
right
to
strike
and
striking
being
those
kind
of
activities.
so,
we're
dealing
here
with
rights
which
had
it
special
in
a
particular
shelter
under
norris-laguardia
and
surely
those
rights
are
not
to
be
set
aside
because
a
right
of
action
for
a
breach
of
contract
was
placed
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
david
previant
i
was
hoping
i
didn't
have
to
but
surely,
i
would.
the
issue
was
raised
on
the
petition
for
cert
at
which
time
we
filed
a
brief,
the
issue
has
been
raised
again
by
the
respondents
here
and
we
have
not
filed
a
reply
brief.
we
think
that
our
brief
already
on
trial
would
answer
it.
the
suggestion
of
mootness
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
this
particular
contract
did
expire
january
31st,
1961.
there's
no
question
about
that.
we
would
urge
the
court
regardless
of
that
to
consider
case
because
it's
a
norris-laguardia
case.
of
course
the
norris-laguardia
act
indicates
that
they
want
a
special
treatment
of
adjunctive
case,
but
we
believe
that
on
the
law,
we
are
entitled
to
a
review
here
because
under
the
act,
the
employer
who
petitions
for
an
injunction
is
required
to
post
a
bond
not
for
cause,
but
for
damages.
mr.
david
previant
that
bond
was
posted.
that
bond
is
still
here.
we
say
that
upon
a
determination
by
this
court
and
we
have
a
right
to
a
determination
by
this
court,
we
may
levy
against
such
bond
for
the
damages
that
were
caused
as
a
result
of
an
improvident
or
an
issuance
of
the
injunction
or
the
issuance
of
an
injunction
without
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
previant
i
would
have
to
say
to
you
frankly
that
if
that
is
the
fact,
it
is
the
first
time
i
hear
it.
mr.
david
previant
i
have
assumed
--
mr.
david
previant
no.
mr.
david
previant
oh,
as
i
understand
the
reply
that
has
been
filed
here
--
mr.
miller
had
called
to
my
attention
at
page
14
of
the
record,
there's
a
reference
to
a
thousand
dollar
bond.
mr.
david
previant
the
other
point
that
is
still
pendent
in
connection
with
this
question
of
mootness
is
that
the
union,
after
having
been
restrained
by
the
district
court,
used
the
grievance
procedure
for
the
purpose
of
taxing
its
cost
to
the
employer
claiming
that
when
the
employer
went
into
court
without
the
employer
having
invoked
the
grievance
procedure,
the
employer
violated
this
contract
and
that
it
was
put
to
damage.
before
that
particular
grievance
could
be
processed,
the
employer
brought
the
matter
back
to
the
federal
district
judge
who
held
that
all
of
these
matters
were
simulated
within
the
judgment
which
he
had
entered
and
restrained
the
union
from
proceeding
in
its
claim
for
damages
because
the
employer
has
violated
the
contract
in
going
to
court
rather
than
submitting
to
grievance
procedure.
so
we
believe
that
on
two
counts,
there
is
a
live
issue
--
mr.
david
previant
that's
at
page
--
at
--
mr.
david
previant
i
beg
your
pardon,
top
of
page
16.
mr.
david
previant
16,
yes.
mr.
david
previant
may
i
reserve,
your
honor.
i
would
make
--
i
would
make
this
final
observation,
if
the
court
please?
the
respondent's
brief
makes
a
very
moving
argument.
now,
what
respondents
considered
to
be
the
injustice
of
any
rule
which
would
permit
the
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
under
lincoln
mills
against
the
employers
and
against
the
union,
but
not
to
the
full
scope
of
equitable
relief.
this
is
a
question
which
this
court
probably
knows
has
been
particularly
alive
since
lincoln
mills,
since
bull.
there's
a
question
however
that
we
very,
very
earnestly
suggest
is
to
be
presented
to
the
conference.
it
is
a
question
which
goes
to
policy
not
to
judicial
inventiveness.
we
have
shown,
we
believe
by
the
legislative
history
here,
that
the
congress
was
aware
of
the
problem.
it
handled
it
in
the
manner
that
it
did.
as
i
suggested
in
the
past,
when
the
congress
felt
that
certain
problems
required
treatment
because
of
certain
injustices
which
may
have
arisen
as
a
result
of
norris-laguardia.
it
found
ways
of
relieving
in
that
pressure
doing
very
little
violence
to
the
principle
which
underlies
norris-laguardia.
the
principle
here
is
a
strike,
its
picketing,
and
i
would
emphasize
again,
it
is
a
non
--
a
strike
or
picketing
because
there
has
been
a
claimed
wage
violation
or
hour
violation.
it's
a
strike
and
picketing
to
organize
--
unorganized
workers,
the
precise
situation
contemplated
by
the
framers
of
norris-laguardia.
we
say
under
these
circumstances,
impassioned
and
moving
pleas
against
injustices
which
may
result
should
be
put
to
the
forum
which
in
our
opinion
is
the
only
one
that
is
competent
to
undo
that
which
it
did
in
1932.
mr.
david
previant
oh,
just
to
inquire
of
the
court
--
how
the
court
would
like
me
to
handle
this
matter
of
the
contracts
shall
have
multiple
copies
sent
to
the
clerk
here
for
distribution
to
the
court.
