j.
brennan,

did
you
say
mr.
previant,
these
are
the
same
contracts
we
had
in
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
both
of
them,
mr.
previant,
i
thought
you
said
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
acted,
i
gather
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
there
was
no
labor
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
there
was
a
labor
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
miller,
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
the
procedure,
whatever
its
steps
are
under
this
agreement
was
not
in
fact
followed,
was
it?
that
is,
were
any
steps
of
this
grievance
procedure
followed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
were
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
make
any
point
even
though
this
has
no
terminal
compulsory
or
binding
arbitration,
do
you
make
any
point
that
nevertheless
under
lincoln
mills
and
301,
the
failure
of
the
union
to
resort
to
those
procedures
or
what
they
were
of
itself
justified
under
lincoln
mills
and
301
and
statutes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
--
let
me
get
this,
you
say
there's
a
stipulation
in
the
case
that
there
was
no
grievance
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
â€“
which
would
make
this
procedure
applicable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
miller,
may
i
just
come
back
a
moment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
the
question
i
asked
you.
i
just
want
to
be
clear
about
this.
you
said
that
the
union
had
stipulated
that
the
--
there
was
no
grievance
which
was
--
should
have
been
the
subject
of
this
grievance
procedure.
well,
do
you
say
the
union
stipulated,
do
you
mean
that
the
parties
have
stipulated
this
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
i'm
clear
you're
not
relying
on
their
failure
to
proceed
under
the
procedure
as
a
basis
upon
which
you're
entitled
to
a
restrain.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
--
that
was
my
original
question
mr.
miller,
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whether
you're
relying
to
support
the
restraint
[inaudible]
on
the
failure
of
the
union
to
go
through
this
procedure,
notwithstanding
it
has
no
terminal
arbitration
provision,
as
a
support
on
the
authority
of
lincoln
mills
in
301
for
the
restraints
you've
got
entirely
apart
from
norris-laguardia
consideration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
on
the
authority
of
lincoln
mills.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
lincoln
mills
involved
a
contract
with
a
terminal
arbitration
procedure
and
this
one
does
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i'm
asking
this
on
the
premise
that
this
procedure
does
not
provide
for
terminal
arbitration,
does
not
provide
for
terminal
arbitration
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
does
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nevertheless,
finds
several
steps
of
a
procedure
under
rather
a
lot
of
procedures.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
point
is
that
under
the
301
the
failure
of
the
union
to
proceed
in
that
manner
if
they
had
a
grievance
under
this
contract
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
entitles
you
to
injunctive
relief
on
that
lincoln
mills
--
the
decision
of
lincoln
mills
supports
you
even
though
in
lincoln
mills
there
was
a
terminal
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
you
think
301
would
go
so
far
as
to
entitle
the
party
claiming
a
breach
immediately
to
go
into
court
without
first
exhausting
the
grievance
procedure
whatever
it
may
be
whether
it
ends
up
in
terminal
arbitration
or
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
miller,
if
i
may
interrupt
just
this
much,
would
there
not
have
been
an
intermediate
statute,
not
that
you
sought
an
injunction
but
sought
a
mandatory
injunction
if
you
please,
requiring
the
union
to
proceed
in
compliance
with
the
contract
grievance
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
why
wouldn't
that
come
before
you
finally
got
to
the
ultimate
of
a
--
of
the
injunction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
wondering
for
your
purposes
that
there
has
been
--
that
you
had
sought
and
obtained
here
an
order
requiring
the
union
to
go
with
you
through
the
grievance
procedure
and
meanwhile,
to
restore
the
status
quo,
if
you
wouldn't
have
accomplished
what
you
needed
without
[inaudible]
against
this
laguardia
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
wouldn't
be
anyway
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
after
all
under
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
recall
the
norris-laguardia
where
its
applicable
would
require
you
in
the
first
instance
to
establish
you
as
a
plaintiff
speaking
injunctive
relief
does
it
not
that
you
establish
that
you
have
exhausted
all
the
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
procedures
before
you
get
injunctive
relief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
know.
