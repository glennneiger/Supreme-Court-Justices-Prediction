justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
this
case
could
be
reversed,
the
liability
could
be
addressed
on
that
bond?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
the
case
did
not
--
were
moot.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
do
concede
that
if
the
case
should
be
reversed,
damages
to
the
extent
of
the
penalty
of
the
bond
might
be
assessed
on
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
mr.
miller,
does
the
union
concede
--
did
they
stipulate
that
you
had
no
adequate
remedy
at
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
now,
what
does
that
do
towards
eliminating
any
possible
need
for
exhaustion
of
any
contract
provisions?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
thereby
this
stipulation
as
i
understand,
you
have
taken
out
everything
except
the
question
that
you're
arguing
here
namely
is
there
power
under
301
to
enforce
the
agreement
once
it
was
made.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
that's
the
only
way
it
could
be
enforced,
why
of
course,
enforce
does
just
as
well.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
do
you
enforce
the
breach
of
a
contract
--
you
prevent
the
breach
of
a
contract
normally
except
by
enjoining
it's
[inaudible]
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand,
in
1947
long
after
norris-laguardia,
congress
said
in
subparagraph
(a)
of
section
301,
suits
for
violation
of
contracts
between
an
employer
and
a
labor
organization
may
be
brought
in
any
federal
district
court
etc.
now,
that
doesn't
say
that
the
district
court
shall
have
--
shall
enforce
labor
contracts
except
when
enforcement
requires
an
injunction,
does
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
says
that
they
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
enforce
the
contract.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
do
you
have
--
congress
surely
would
have
the
power
if
it
had
gone
on,
nobody
would
dispute
it,
i
take
it
and
said,
all
of
this
despite
the
norris-laguardia
act
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
now,
did
it
have
to
say
that?
