mr.
malcolm
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please?
like
in
all
matters
that
come
before
the
court,
we
come
here
with
some
knowns
and
one
big
unknown.
we
know
that
the
union
in
this
case
violated
its
contract
and
tied
up
the
respondents'
businesses
so
they
had
no
businesses.
we
know
that
in
doing
so,
they
did
so
when
they
stipulated
in
court
that
it
caused
irreparable
injury,
that
the
employers
had
no
adequate
remedy
at
law
and
could
proceed,
if
at
all,
under
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947
which
the
court
provided
as
all
your
honors
know
that
either
unions
or
employers
can
in
industries
affecting
commerce
and
that
includes
the
one
we
have
here
before
you
now,
go
to
the
federal
courts
to
enforce
labor
contracts.
our
question
is,
does
that
statute
mean
what
it
says?
can
we
enforce
the
labor
contracts
which
the
union
had
with
the
employers
here?
the
district
court
said,
“yes.”
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“yes.”
the
matter
is
now
for
your
honors'
determination.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
there
is
an
elaborate
grievance
procedure.
i
think
that
counsel
is
correct.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
the
part
--
a
portion
of
it
if
your
honor
please
is
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
9.
mr.
malcolm
miller
but
the
entire
contract,
i
will
tell
you
how
it
has
occurred
in
all
likelihood
although
i
had
nothing
really
to
do
with
the
record
in
this
court
being
the
respondent
here.
the
contracts
themselves
are
printed,
one
over
the
road
contract
and
one
local
cartage
contract.
they
were
under
the
rules
of
the
court
of
appeals
filed
in
sufficient
copies
for
all
the
judges
rather
than
reproduced
as
a
record
in
the
court
of
appeals.
they
were
already
printed,
we
just
sent
them
up
five
copies
each
and
as
counsel
indicates
at
the
time
it
was
--
the
court
of
appeals
worked
it
in
this
matter.
and
i'm
sure
--
that
sure
that
the
certiorari
record
here
has
the
entire
contracts
which
are
printed
attached
to
it.
but
the
--
the
printing
done
in
this
court
only
includes
the
excerpts
which
your
honors
obviously
all
know
across.
but
to
answer
your
honors'
question
as
good
as
i
can
answer
it,
i
think
the
grievance
procedure
is
very
broad
in
its
beginning
that
any
dispute
between
the
parties,
they
will
endeavor
to
settle
peaceably
following
the
grievance
procedure.
whether
or
not
there
is
compulsory
arbitration,
i
think
depends
upon
several
things
besides
that
contract.
i
don't
think
the
contracts
have
to
go
to
arbitration.
it
says
they
have
to
go
through
the
grievance
procedure.
here
though,
if
your
honors
please,
we
don't
have
any
dispute
with
them.
they
didn't
make
any
demand
upon
us.
they
just
tied
up
the
whole
business.
if
we
had
anything
to
do
at
all,
it
was
to
go
to
court
under
the
labor
management
relations
act
to
seek
relief
and
what
we
sought
was
the
only
relief
possible
to
get
in
our
situation
which
was
an
injunction.
now,
the
labor
management
relations
act
says
that
either
the
union
or
the
employers
can
go
to
federal
courts
that
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
without
requirements
of
diversity
in
the
amount
of
controversy
so
long
as
the
case
is
one
to
enforce
a
labor
contract.
it
does
not
say
that
you
bring
a
suit
for
damages.
it
says
you
bring
a
suit
to
enforce
the
labor
contract.
now,
actually,
there's
only
one
real
way
to
enforce
the
contract
and
that
is
by
equitable
power.
there
is
nothing
in
301
that
says
you
--
the
court
should
not
have
that
to
be
in
order
to
reach
the
idea,
they
come
up
with
the
theory
that
under
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947,
there
is
no
--
there
are
no
equity
power.
counsel
must
go
back
to
1932
and
look
at
norris-laguardia.
keep
going
back
to
an
older
act
to
try
to
say
that
the
plain
words
in
301,
a
later
act
do
not
mean
what
they
say.
they
say
the
federal
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
enforce
labor
contracts.
they
go
back
to
norris-laguardia
and
say,
“look,
the
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
protected
activity
under
section
4.”
it's
a
labor
dispute
under
section
13
of
norris-laguardia.
i
submit
to
your
honors,
it
cannot
be.
it
would
be
the
strangest
anomaly
yet.
if
the
norris-laguardia
which
was
passed
to
ensure
a
more
equal
mutual
bargaining
between
unions
on
the
one
hand
and
employers
on
the
other,
so
that
they
could
arrive
at
collective
agreements,
were
used
to
ensure
that
collective
agreements
once
arrived
at
could
be
brief
within
hearing.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
if
your
honor
please,
certainly
it's
true.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well
now,
if
your
honor
please,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
exactly
what
you
say
because
i
don't
think
this
is
true.
most
certainly,
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
ordinarily
to
enforce
means
all
the
two
enforcements.
damages
ordinarily
are
not
a
way
to
enforce
the
contract.
they're
to
put
a
bar
in
it
to
keep
you
from
violating
it
but
their
suit
for
violation,
that's
what
their
purpose
[inaudible]
now,
quite
obviously
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
certainly.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
enforce
means
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
--
that
it
means
--
that
it
means
equitable
power.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
that's
the
only
way
really
to
enforce
the
contract.
a
suit
for
damage
is
a
suit
for
breach
of
a
contract.
mr.
malcolm
miller
but
that's
why
--
what
it
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
yes.
mr.
malcolm
miller
yes,
now,
i
will
like
to
get
just
to
this
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
it's
most
certainly
true
in
1932
the
courts
were
in
this
dispute
so
far
as
congress
was
concerned
why
it
passed
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
malcolm
miller
that
is
right.
mr.
malcolm
miller
and
the
congress
--
the
congress
felt
so
insensitive
by
it
that
they
did
and
i
think
it
was
for
the
first
time,
at
least
it's
for
the
first
time
according
to
some
of
the
commentaries,
i
haven't
checked
if
these
--
if
this
is
true.
for
the
first
time,
passed
a
public
policy
statement
right,
in
line
and
right
along
with
the
norris-laguardia
act,
section
2
of
the
act
in
which
they
pointed
out
that
the
court
had
gotten
into
labor
relations
where
the
congress
felt
they
should
not
be
and
had
kept
the
real
forces
which
would
make
for
mutual
bargaining
between
[inaudible]
from
taking
place.
they
pointed
out
that
it
was
the
policy
of
norris-laguardia
to
ensure
that
workers
could
band
together,
could
join
unions
so
that
they
could
collect
doubly,
bargain
with
the
equality,
but
the
employer
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
--
with
[inaudible]
mr.
malcolm
miller
that's
what
the
public
policy
statement
is,
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
i
understand
your
honor
that
you
--
your
point
is
that
the
federal
courts
were
not
to
enter
this
area.
i
think
the
public
policy
statement
bares
it
out.
they
followed
it
in
section
3
that
the
congress
itself
and
they
provided
that
this
is
what
should
be
read
by
the
courts
in
construing
this
act,
that
the
contracts
not
to
join
unions,
not
to
collective
bargaining
would
be
unenforceable.
but
if
your
honor
please,
that's
not
our
situation
as
we're
here
before
you
today.
the
congress
has
spoken
again,
they
spoke
in
1947
and
this
time,
they
also
had
a
policy
in
mind.
they
changed
their
minds.
they
decided
there
was
a
place
for
the
court
in
labor
relations
and
that
ways
--
was
one
[inaudible]
narrow
one
so
far
as
we're
here
and
that
was
to
ensure
that
labor
contracts
once
they
were
entered
into
would
be
enforceable.
mr.
malcolm
miller
but
if
your
honor
please,
mr.
hartley
himself
in
answering
a
question
on
the
floor
and
it's
in
the
(inaudible).
that
exactly,
that
it
embraced
both
equitable
relief
injunctions
and
actions
for
damages.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
now
--
i
would
like
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
would
very
gladly
go
to
that
one
right
now.
most
certainly,
the
house
believed
in
mutuality
of
remedy
so
far
as
a
labor
agreement,
once
the
bargaining
process
was
over,
the
labor
agreement
was
made
for
any
in
violation
of
that
rule,
there's
no
question
this
is
true,
they
specifically
so
provided
in
what
they
passed
in
the
first
instance.
the
senate
version
was
somewhat
different.
it's
certainly
also
true.
they
provided
both
for
suits
in
federal
courts
and
for
administrative
action
so
that
you
go
first
to
the
board
and
from
the
board
to
the
federal
courts.
with
the
difference
between
the
arguments,
the
matter
was
referred
to
congress,
but
if
your
honor
please,
they
had
both
determined
already
that
the
courts
had
a
place
in
labor
relations
and
it
was
to
enforce
with
injunctions
if
necessary
labor
contracts
so
that
neither
the
employer
or
the
union
would
violate
those
contracts.
mr.
malcolm
miller
now
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
but
now
if
your
honor
please,
the
conference
had
to
put
the
two
together.
they
took
from
the
--
actually,
they
passed
the
senate
version
taking
away
the
administrative
portions
before
the
nlrb,
that's
what
they
passed.
mr.
malcolm
miller
but,
if
your
honor
please,
isn't
it
more
important
that
the
house
as
it
both
already
made
up
their
mind
what
they
did,
it
isn't
the
conference
committee
that
passed
this
act,
it's
the
congress
that
passed
this
act.
both
houses
had
decided
that
this
was
a
place
for
the
federal
court.
the
conference
committee
report
said,
“we
will
leave
the
enforcement
of
labor
contracts
to
the
usual
processes
of
the
law
--
by
the
usual
processes
of
the
law.”
mr.
malcolm
miller
that's
what
the
conference
committee
report
says.
mr.
malcolm
miller
yes.
mr.
malcolm
miller
that
is
correct,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
without
any
reference
to
the
norris-laguardia
act,
they
just
said
we
will
leave
it
to
usual
processes
of
the
law.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
don't
say
by
that
statement
they
impliedly
repealed
the
norris-laguardia
act
but
they
don't
think
the
norris-laguardia
ever
applied
in
the
situation
in
the
first
place.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
think
if
that's
true,
it's
the
easy
the
way
to
go
in
it
and
i
think
it
is
true.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
think
it
is
true,
if
your
honor
please,
because
there
is
nothing
in
what
we
are
here
asking
this
court
to
answer
that
stops
any
union,
any
employee
from
banding
together
and
making
a
collective
agreement.
all
we
are
here
concerned
with
is
whether
once
that
agreement
is
made,
can
you
hold
them
to
it?
now,
norris-laguardia
wasn't
that
keeps
such
agreements
from
being
made.
most
certainly,
no
one
ever
suggested
that
in
the
legislative
history
of
norris-laguardia
certainly
indicates,
no
one,
i'm
certain
to
suggest
that
those
collective
agreements,
the
unions
were
so
anxious
to
have
the
right
to
make
and
that
congress
agreed
most
certainly,
this
is
a
good
thing.
they
were
supposed
to
then
violate.
they
were
concern
to
norris-laguardia
although
you're
going
to
violate
a
collective
agreement.
they
were
concerned
in
your
right
to
make
such
an
agreement.
we
are
here
concerned
with
--
can
you
hold
them
to
the
bargain
that
they
made.
mr.
malcolm
miller
but
the
congress
put
the
federal
courts
in
business.
mr.
malcolm
miller
yes,
i
understand
if
your
honor
please,
it
may
be
and
i
maintain
in
this
part
of
my
argument
in
our
brief
that
norris-laguardia
never
applied
to
our
situation
here.
mr.
malcolm
miller
so,
you
don't
have
to
get
to
the
problem
of
accommodation
although
more
certainly
i
think
you
could
arrive
at
it
in
this
direction
and
it
may
be
that
for
many
minds
have
not
used,
to
say
look,
we
see
the
real
abuses,
the
real
feeling
for
norris-laguardia
on
the
one
hand
and
the
labor
management
relations
act
on
the
other
and
we
can
reconcile
it.
we
can
accommodate
the
two
to
make
out
of
two
labor
statutes,
one,
cohesive
hold.
if
one
went
to
the
state
court
to
enforce
then
we
have
the
problem
of
getting
into
--
we
have
50
states,
are
they
all
going
to
come
out
alike?
i
understand
that
the
court
has
such
a
case
either
on
its
docket
now
or
it
would
shortly
be
on
this
docket,
i
have
deliberately
stayed
away
from
this
portion
of
it
because
that
is
the
entire
case,
we
went
to
the
federal
court
and
the
labor
management
relations
act
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
surely.
mr.
malcolm
miller
that
is
correct
if
your
honor
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
there
were
none
of
them
followed.
the
union
first
wrote
the
letter
and
said,
“look,
going
to
picket
your
plant.”
the
next
thing
they
--
everybody
walked
off
the
job,
they
were
placed,
they
were
all
tied
up.
business
is
--
was
done
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
let
me
give
your
honor
please,
when
they
bypass
any
grievance
and
instructions,
i've
got
no
quarrel
with
them
putting
up
a
picket
and
to
advertise
anything
under
the
sun.
i
only
quarrel
with
violating
their
agreement
to
keep
workers.
when
they
struck,
tied
up
the
respondent's
business,
i
think
--
and
bypassed
any
grievance,
of
course
they
agreed
and
stipulated
in
open
court,
there
was
no
grievance.
it's
the
reason
why
they
didn't
go
there
but
when
they
tied
that
up,
when
they
struck
those
plants,
i
think
we
had
a
right
at
that
time
to
go
to
court.
mr.
malcolm
miller
they
have
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
they
have
agreed
then
so
that
they
had
no
grievance
without
any
particular
reasons.
mr.
malcolm
miller
yes.
yes
sir.
yes
mr.
justice
douglas.
if
i
want
--
and
i'll
tell
you
where
this
came
about
if
i
may
please.
mr.
malcolm
miller
once
the
employers
had
brought
their
suit
under
section
301
and
had
obtained
after
hearing
and
the
putting
on
of
evidence
for
both
sides,
a
permanent
injunction
restraining
the
union
from
violating
the
contract,
then
the
unions
sent
notice
to
the
employer
that
it
elected
to
go
before
the
joint
state
committee
and
claim
damages
by
virtue
of
the
employer
getting
an
injunction
against
the
union
to
keep
it
from
violating
its
contract.
they
did
not
go
to
the
joint
state
committee
until
the
district
court
in
this
action
had
already
acted,
until
it
had
already
issued
its
permanent
injunction.
they
then
went
before
the
joint
state
committee
or
sought
to,
maintaining
they
had
a
right
to
damages
by
virtue
of
the
employer's
action
in
going
to
court
in
getting
an
injunction.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
as
soon
as
that
happened,
they
said
the
--
we
have
a
right
to
damages
because
you
have
--
you
went
to
court
and
gotten
an
injunction.
we
went
back
to
court
that
now
if
the
court
please,
we've
determined
this
matter,
the
controversy
between
the
union
on
the
one
hand
and
the
employers
on
the
other,
right
here
is
this
court
and
now
they're
going
before
a
joint
state
committee
seeking
to
have
a
--
that
matter
which
you
have
determined
–
redetermined.
the
court
that
it
looked
that
way
to
me,
the
union
agreed
that
what
they
were
doing
and
stipulated
that
they
themselves
shall
be
enjoined
from
proceeding
before
the
joint
state
committee
and
should
instead
if
they
differed
with
the
district
court's
decision
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
if
the
courts
didn't
like
that,
it
would
--
here's
the
certiorari
in
this
court.
now
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
no
sir.
if
your
honors
please,
they
have
never
asked
the
district
court
for
damages
in
their
original
pleading
or
anything
filed
subsequently.
mr.
malcolm
miller
now,
the
reason
for
the
bond
if
your
honor
please
is
not
because
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
at
all
because
we
didn't
proceed
pursuant
the
norris-laguardia
act.
we
proceeded
under
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
we
posted
a
thousand
dollar
bond
clearly
and
simply
because
this
is
a
requirement
in
our
court
on
a
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
take
it
this
is
possible
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
malcolm
miller
if
your
honor
please,
again,
you're
bringing
up
the
point.
i
filed
a
suggestion
for
mootness
because
i
thought
it's
my
duty
to
file
a
suggestion.
i
am
not
up
here
arguing.
i
would
much
prefer
that
your
--
your
honors
answered
the
merits
of
this
case
and
i
would
proceed
(voice

--
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
it
is
in
the
manner.
i
didn't
file
a
motion
so
i
can't
withdraw.
i
did
what
i
conceive
to
(voice

--
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
am
not
pressing
it.
mr.
malcolm
miller
if
your
honor
please,
i
have
not
briefed
this
point
but
i
think
it's
entirely
possible
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
malcolm
miller
surely.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
the
union
--
the
union
asserted,
i
should
put
it
this
way.
we
in
our
complaint
allege
that
they
had
not
sought
to
go
to
--
through
the
grievance
procedure
where
[inaudible].
they
came
back
and
said,
“well,
we
didn't
have
any
grievance
with
you.”
so
of
course,
we
didn't
seek
any
redress
under
the
grievance
procedure
in
this
contract.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
think
when
they
bypassed
it,
if
for
no
other
reasons,
we
had
a
right
to
go
to
court.
mr.
malcolm
miller
this
isn't
true.
mr.
malcolm
miller
when
they
didn't
go
through
the
procedure
and
they
went
out
and
in
effect
struck
as
counsel
very,
very
(voice

puts
it.
mr.
malcolm
miller
we
had
a
--
we
had
a
right
because
of
their
action
not
to
initiate
the
grievance
procedure
but
to
go
straight
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
if
your
honor
please,
there
are
--
i
think
there
are
three
good
questions
in
--
behind
what
your
honor
is
getting
at.
i
think
the
simple
way
of
going
at
it
is
exactly
the
way
i
put
it.
when
the
union
bypassed
grievances,
assuming
that
there
was
anything
there
to
have
a
grievance
[inaudible]
i
think
when
they
bind
it
we
had
a
right
to
go
to
court
under
301.
mr.
malcolm
miller
and
this
would
be
true
under
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
yes,
and
i
think
there
comes
the
second
question
i
mean,
since
lincoln
mills,
when
you
have
agreed
to
proceed
in
this
manner
is,
is
there
in
the
law
which
your
honors
maintained
must
grow
up
in
this
area.
does
this
contract
really
provide
for
compulsory
arbitration,
albeit,
it
doesn't
say
so
in
so
many
words.
i
can't
answer
this
question
if
your
honor
please
because
i
didn't
reach
this
point.
i
have
not
gone
into
it
except
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
[inaudible]
of
the
question.
mr.
malcolm
miller
this
contract
does
not
have
the
compulsory
arbitration
feature
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
--
which
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
that's
right.
that
is
correct.
mr.
malcolm
miller
certain
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
think
this
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
another
theory
we
could
also
go
on.
as
long
as
--
and
this
one
aside
from
the
arbitration
cases,
that
if
a
union
by
--
or
an
employer
and
hasn't
--
this
is
not
a
one
way
street
i
am
arguing
for,
if
a
union
or
an
employer
violate
its
labor
contract,
its
collective
bargaining
agreement,
one
with
the
other,
either
one,
the
injured
party
may
go
to
court
to
obtain
an
injunction
restraining
such
violation.
it
may
well
be
and
i
am
aware
that
they
--
we
are
here
--
it's
very
difficult
to
make
a
pure
case
for
it
because
there
may
well
be
a
problem
as
to
whether
or
not
the
contentions
of
the
parties
show
that
there
is
a
matter
which
needs
to
be
arbitrated
before
the
court
can
determine
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
the
contract.
we
don't
have
that
in
this
case
and
i
therefore
have
not
gone
into
that
which
i
consider
it's
quite
a
matter
by
itself.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
think
it's
quite
possible
your
honor
for
it
to
be
either
way
depending
upon
what
the
violation
is.
mr.
malcolm
miller
yes
it
is,
if
your
honor
please.
because
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
we
--
its
brought
under
301
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
malcolm
miller
it
was
--
it
was
--
i
didn't
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
--
myself
draw
the
complaint.
i
have
read
it
many
times.
the
theory
of
the
complaint
was
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
under
section
301
to
enjoin
a
violation
of
a
collective
grieve
--
labor
contract.
the
section
is
itself
called
to
the
court's
attention.
now,
i
think
it
is
--
the
case
has
been
withheld
every
time
you
go
under
the
step,
you
refine
it
a
bit
more.
and
by
the
time
it
gets
down
to
the
argument
here,
sometimes
it's
--
it
looks
a
little
more
appealing
from
where
it
began.
but
to
answer
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
it
is
my
view
and
it
is
my
position
that
when
they
bypassed
grievance
and
struck
first,
that
we
had
a
right
under
section
301
to
go
to
court
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
--
speaking
to
enforce
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
well
now,
if
your
honor
please,
you've
touched
a
real
good
point.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
we
still
--
we
--
this
--
as
you
put
it,
mr.
justice
black,
only
entitle
us
to
go
to
court.
we
still
have
to
then
show
that
we
have
such
a
case
or
the
301
is
such
a
statute
that
we
are
entitled
to
an
injunction.
mr.
malcolm
miller
now,
i
don't
think
if
your
honor
please
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
--
to
get
them
into
a
repeal
of
norris-laguardia,
but
i
would
gladly
address
myself
to
your
honor's
problem.
when
we
file
such
a
complaint,
we
must,
number
one,
forget
norris-laguardia
with
me
for
just
a
moment
because
it
has
this
--
there's
a
two-edged
sword
here.
we
must
number
one
show
we're
entitled
that
relief
in
any
event.
this
of
course
depends
on
many
things,
as
everyone
of
us
are
well
aware,
you're
not
entitled
to
go
to
equity
as
long
as
you
have
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
we
plead
we
did
not
have
one.
the
union
agreed
with
us
that
we
did
not
have
one.
they
said
most
certainly,
“we'll
agree”
and
they
did
stipulate
in
open
court
that
we
were
caused
irreparable
injury
and
had
no
adequate
remedy
at
law
because
the
union
had
no
funds
with
which
to
refund
the
damages.
therefore
we
got
down
to
one
problem
where
we
had
two
before,
now
we
just
have
one,
does
301
allows
the
court
to
issue
an
injunction?
we
got
an
injunction
kind
of
case
now
if
it
only
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
the
injunction.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
i
know
that
this
is
where
your
honor
wants
to
get
[attempt
to
laughter]
and
i'm
not
ignoring
your
honor
in
getting
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
think
that
--
i
think
what
you
have
to
do
number
one,
if
your
honor
please,
is
look
to
the
labor
management
relations
act.
i
think
you
look
to
the
norris-laguardia
act,
not
want.
my
difference
with
your
honor
is
not
that
i
wanted
to
keep
what
obviously
would
have
to
be
in
it,
but
it's
the
procedure
in
which
you
get
there.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
think
this
is
a
possibility.
i
think
this
is
another
means
of
getting
at
the
problem.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
because
of
a
principle
of
law
which
we
went
into
below
which
nobody
has
brought
up
or
even
made
a
point
here
until
your
honor
brought
it
up
and
i
thought
this
is
what
your
honor
was
getting
at
in
the
first
instance
when
you
first
started
asking
these
questions.
there
is
if
one
side
first
violates
a
contract
here,
striking
to
that
going
to
grievance,
that
what
duty
the
other
side
has
to
go
to
grievance
is
excused
because
of
the
first
violation
and
there
is
quite
a
body
of
law
in
this
area
and
i
don't
mean
to
get
around
with
your
honor's
question
at
all
because
i
think
this
is
one
other
way
of
going
at
it.
for
example,
let's
assume
that
they
go
into
arbitration
in
the
first
instance,
and
i'm
aware
that
we
have
compulsory
arbitration
because
this
is
a
bit
different
than
--
which
your
honors
asked
in
lincoln
mills
and
the
arbitrator
had
determined
that
there
was
not
here
any
dispute
between
the
parties,
that's
the
most
certain
they
had
agreed
that
they
weren't
going
to
stop
the
works.
in
the
light
of
this
contract,
they
were
going
to
remain
on
the
job
if
they
wanted
to
advertise
and
get
other
people
in.
they're
going
to
have
to
make
a
deal
with
their
own
union
so
that
they
did
work
behind
those
banners.
and
notwithstanding
that
they
determined
this,
the
union
had
members
decide,
“we're
not
going
to
work
behind
those
banners
will
also
lost
the
job”
then
i
think
we
would
again
have
the
problem
of
[inaudible]
--
to
try
this
specifically
enforced
the
arbitrator's
word
or
you
can
try
to
get
it.
it
was
pending
and
had
(inaudible)
--
an
injunction
from
the
court
restraining
and
holding
the
status
quo
until
it
has
then
determined.
but
i
think
in
--
while
those
are
definitely
procedures
that
might
take
place,
if
--
and
this
matter
comes
here
with
this
already
determined,
if
there
has
been
a
violation
of
that
collective
agreement,
of
the
labor
contract,
the
big
problem
we
have
to
answer
is,
can
the
federal
courts
enforce
that
contract
whether
they
go
into
arbitration
or
not,
is
at
this
point
i
think
not
material,
it
might
be.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
think
you're
going
to
hit
the
same
kind
of
problem
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
--
the
way
that
you
go
at
it
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
think
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
if
these
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
that
is
one
of
the
prerequisites
but
i
think
it
gets
back
what
mr.
justice
black
started
to
ask
and
the
first
thing,
that
you've
got
this
--
get
in
to
both
of
these
statutes
and
we're
not
going
to
be
able
to
forget
either
one
of
them.
on
the
one
hand,
to
read
with
me,
the
labor
management
relations
act
first,
and
the
norris-laguardia
act
then
second
put
them
together.
while
as
i
understood
his
question,
he
got
the
norris-laguardia
before
i
got
to
court
because
i
got
the
court
with
the
labor
management
relations
act.
is
that
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
surely.
mr.
malcolm
miller
kansas
does
not
have
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
--
a
little
norris-laguardia
act.
new
york
has,
i
know,
i've
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
--
read
some
of
the
cases
and
then
cited
some
to
the
court
with
you
but
kansas
doesn't
have.
mr.
malcolm
miller
kansas
does
not.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
whittaker
would
be
able
to
tell
me.
i
do
not
recall
whether
they
do
or
not.
but
if
your
honors
please,
i
just
like
to
leave
you
with
just
one
thought
and
i
know
the
problems
aren't
easy,
and
i
probably
read
on
the
appendix
to
the
point
where
no
longer
am
--
i
could,
if
ever
i
could
be
as
a
lawyer
with
an
adequate
--
anybody
who
had
outcome
biased
it
that
i
had
upon
it.
mr.
malcolm
miller
they
did,
if
your
honor
please,
explicitly.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
think
it
has
a
definite
bearing
on
it,
if
your
honor
please.
i
think
when
i
started
to
answer
mr.
justice
black's
question.
when
they
did
this,
we
got
over
the
first
big
hurdle
which
otherwise
we've
had
through
and
they
weren't
doing
it
to
be
cure
at
all.
they're
only
doing
it
because
they
agreed
this
was
the
situation.
we
then
had
a
case
ripe
for
equity
if
indeed,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
federal
court
could
exercise
equitable
powers.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
think
if
your
honor
please,
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
malcolm
miller
that
is
correct
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
understood
you
both
to
say
the
same
thing.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
don't
know
any
other
way
if
your
honor
please.
but
i
can't
say
that
mr.
justice
black's
question,
because
i'm
quite
well
aware
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
the
court
doesn't
have
any
jurisdiction
against
using
injunction.
i
maintain
and
it
is
of
course
my
position
that
you
can't
read
out
the
broad
version
of
301
passed
in
1947
by
the
norris-laguardia
act
of
1932
particularly
when
you've
got
to
keep
in
mind,
we
aren't
trying
to
keep
the
union
from
bargaining
the
thing
which
norris-laguardia
was
brought.
we're
only
trying
to
hold
them
to
their
bargain
that
they
already
made.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
think
you
have
to
read
it
out,
yes,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
malcolm
miller
301
says
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
i
cannot
say
that
that's
true
if
your
honor
please.
there's
no
doubt
in
many
ways
to
state
it
but
i
think
that
you've
got
to
start
with
the
--
what
301
says
and
it
says
that
a
union
or
an
employer
may
go
to
federal
court
and
that
court
does
have
jurisdiction
regardless
of
diversity
to
enforce
labor
contracts,
that's
a
broad
conviction.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
don't
want
to
stop
there.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
if
your
honor
please
that
that
is
the
only
consideration.
i
think
that's
the
starting
point.
most
definitely
i
agree
with
you
that
then
you
must
examine
norris-laguardia
act
to
see
if
in
fact
if
on
its
face,
from
its
public
policy
statement,
from
the
contracts
it
maintains
are
not
enforceable
which
most
certainly
aren't
collective
agreements?
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
but
if
your
honor
please,
you're
not
--
you
aren't
getting
what
i
thought
i
would
say.
what
i
say
is
that
to
maintain
that
the
labor
management
relations
act
does
not
include
injunctions,
requires
you
to
read
something
in
that
statute
that
isn't
already
there.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
i
don't
know
any
(voice

--
mr.
malcolm
miller
(voice

your
honor
please
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
have
--
i
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
your
honor
at
all.
it's
purely
and
simply
that
i
don't
speak
as
well
because
i
am
most
certain
that
this
is
the
way
to
construe
a
statute.
and
when
i
was
speaking
to
mr.
justice
black,
i
felt
like
a
authority
with
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
purely
and
simply
because
it's
much
easier
for
me
to
do
[inaudible]
already,
from
the
1932
act.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
before
that,
i
couldn't
go
on
the
federal
court
at
all.
mr.
malcolm
miller
if
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
except
for
one
thing
if
your
honor
please,
there's
a
violation
of
a
collective
agreement.
is
that
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
yes,
that's
the
question.
mr.
malcolm
miller
that
is
the
question,
most
definitely.
mr.
malcolm
miller
that
is
certainly
true.
mr.
malcolm
miller
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
malcolm
miller
and
i
maintain
that
for
two
reasons.
the
norris-laguardia
doesn't
do
it,
doesn't
stand
in
the
way
of
enforcing
the
contract
by
the
injunction
and
it's
because
a
violation
of
a
collective
agreement
which
we
have
here.
that's
the
matter
we
have
before
the
court
isn't
section
4
protected
activity
or
a
section
13,
may
be
a
dispute
and
if
there
is
any
real
question
of
that,
that
you
must
read
the
two
statutes
together
and
see
if
you
can't
do
harmoniously,
harmonize
the
two
to
make
--
to
ensure
that
the
purpose
of
norris-laguardia
and
is
for
a
basic
purpose
to
promote
collective
bargaining
agreements.
if
not,
curtail
and
i
submit
it
would
not
be
by
enforcing
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
see
we
are
here
tampering
with
bargaining,
we're
here
in
trying
to
ensure
that
the
bargain
made
is
kept.
mr.
malcolm
miller
and
the
only
way
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
--
we
can
ensure
is
to
get
the
injunction.
that's
the
only
thing
--
its
only
the
way
we
could
ensure
it
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well
now,
this
is
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
think
you
can
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
that's
right.
mr.
malcolm
miller
oh,
then
we
most
certainly
would
have
to
call
it
repeal,
call
it
accommodation,
call
it
whatever
word
one
wishes
to
use,
your
--
well,
your
honor,
would
most
certainly
be
correct.
mr.
malcolm
miller
but
if
your
honor
please,
the
contract,
they
were
considered
were
not
collective
agreements.
they
were
contracts
that
won't
join
the
union.
we
won't
bother
to
get
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
--
to
get
a
collective
agreement.
mr.
malcolm
miller
yes.
mr.
malcolm
miller
if
your
honor
please,
there
is
nothing
in
the
congressional
history
or
norris-laguardia
act
dealing
with
collective
agreement
only
with
these
restrictive
things
on
making
collective
agreement.
mr.
malcolm
miller
there
weren't
any
collective
agreements
though
i
know
there
were
some.
mr.
malcolm
miller
but
that
wasn't
the
problem.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
i
am
sure
that
they
endeavored
to
enforce
collective
agreements
and
i'm
right
here
in
this
court
seeking
to
enforce
a
collective
agreement,
but
most
certainly,
we
aren't
endeavoring
to
keep
any
union
any
employees
from
banding
together
to
make
such
agreements.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well
--
but
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
the
congress
puts
them
back
in
1947
even
if
they
did
withdraw.
mr.
malcolm
miller
you
are
correct
your
honor.
this
is
my
point.
mr.
malcolm
miller
it
doesn't
take
anything
away
from
it
in
enforcing
it.
mr.
malcolm
miller
that's
your
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
they
submit
it
didn't
that
the
way
they
wrote
it,
if
you
read
the
statutes
together,
this
is
what
they
had
to
mean
despite
the
fact
they
diffused
the
words
which
your
honors
have
given.
mr.
malcolm
miller
almost
certainly
your
honor
we
probably
wouldn't
have
to
be
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
this
would
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
this
would
have
done
it.
we
would
not
have
had
to
be
here
at
all.
mr.
malcolm
miller
that's
right.
and
you
see
the
house
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
--
had
it
in
their
bill
(voice

--
mr.
malcolm
miller
--
conference
committee
struck
it
out.
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
the
house
had
passed
it.
mr.
malcolm
miller
but
their
conference
struck
it.
mr.
malcolm
miller
no.
actually
(voice

--
mr.
malcolm
miller
i
wouldn't
say
they
wouldn't
pass,
your
honor
please
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
miller
they
didn't
pass
those
particular
words
but
like
mr.
whittaker
said,
i
think
when
the
(voice

--
mr.
malcolm
miller
well,
most
of
the
time,
they
don't
do
it
in
the
way
we
like
them
to
do
it.
i
take
it
all
your
honors
have
given
many
of
these
more
than
i'll
ever
see.
but
anyway,
i
think
i've
at
least
i've
endeavored
to
make
my
point
clear
and
i
surely
thank
you
your
honors.
