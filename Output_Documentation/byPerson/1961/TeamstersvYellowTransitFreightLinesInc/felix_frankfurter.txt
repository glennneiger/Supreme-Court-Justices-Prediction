justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
simple
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
normal
course
of
affairs,
that's
the
normal
course
of
affairs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
common
ground
--
is
that
con
--
common
ground
between
you
and
the
respondent
would
agree
all
around
that
301,
its
purpose
would've
been
barred
by
the
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
agreed
all
around
that
but
for
301,
norris-laguardia
would've
barred
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
was
just
wondering
on
what
assumptions
we
must
go,
there
was
a
labor
dispute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
refresh
my
recollection
to
(a)
go
on
the
grounds
first
to
[inaudible]
and
you
tell
me
your
position,
on
the
ground
that
301
left
untouched
norris-laguardia
or
that
the
policy
determination
of
the
courts
to
call
upon
to
make
because
of
lincoln
mills
continued
as
a
policy
attributable
to
301
to
what
norris-laguardia
explicitly
prohibited,
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
an
injunction
in
labor
cases
is
procedural
law,
is
that
it?
are
we
back
there,
that
nice
[inaudible]
land
of
distinction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
[inaudible]
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
make
my
question
clear
to
you
mr.
previant
because
i
believe
it's
important
whether
the
court
that
withheld
[inaudible]
and
you
did
not
--
we
don't
have
to
go
underground
that
they
go,
whether
the
courts
and
or
you
suppose
that
whatever
scope
is
left
for
judicial
construction
or
evolution
out
of
301,
it
can't
touch
norris-laguardia
or
that
construing
301
as
a
mandate
of
the
courts
to
make
appropriate
national
labor
policies,
it
would
--
it
would
derive
from
301
or
from
its
own
notions
of
wisdom,
legal
wisdom
that
norris-laguardia
is
a
good
national
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
that
not
allowing
an
injunction,
denying
the
federal
courts
the
right
to
issue
an
injunction,
is
still
an
application
of
301,
you
don't
have
to
bother
norris-laguardia,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
because
of
301
that
you
don't
have
to
construe
norris-laguardia
that
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
dialectic
about
this,
but
just
to
me
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference,
whether
my
problem
is
that
301
doesn't
touch
norris-laguardia
despite
the
large
at
leave
that
lincoln
mills
gives
me
in
construing
its
scope,
that
301
doesn't
touch
it
because
congress
has
been
specific
for
--
that
applying
301
and
forgetting
all
about
the
norris-laguardia
except
if
there's
a
light
on
policy
out
of
301,
disallows
such
injunctive
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
you
mean
not
to
answer
my
question
specifically,
but
still
i
don't
understand
whether
i
am
to
make
an
independent
judgment
on
the
power
that
is
left
to
the
judiciary
under
lincoln
mills
in
construing
301.
so
construing
it,
i
would
say,
it's
a
bad
business
to
enjoin
this
kind
of
a
thing
or
--
and
i'd
say
i
don't
have
to
bother
by
301,
norris-laguardia
is
a
specific
statute,
this
falls
within
it,
never
mind
301,
i
put
that
undecided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
not
prior
to
301
but
norris-laguardia
would
cover
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
whole
question
is
what
part
does
301
play
if
any
in
our
construction
and
not
a
question
of
writing
under
the
railroad
labor
act
either,
is
that
right?
is
the
railroad
labor
act
to
put
aside?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
so
that
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
that
problem
of
what
to
do
with
two
statutes
which
deal
with
that
specific
problem,
at
least
two
statutes
in
the
same
field.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
–
i
will
get
more
enlightened
as
you
go
along.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
remember,
you
would
correct
me
mr.
previant,
but
in
the
course
of
legislative
history
that
you
know,
at
least
relating
to
the
subject
matter
you've
just
traversed,
those
are
separate
provisions,
but
there
was
--
was
there
any
--
were
there
any
amendments
proposed
with
reference
to
301
itself
dealing
with
this
problem
which
said
that
this
should
include
the
right
to
[inaudible]
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
there
wasn't
anything
with
reference
with
301
that
tied
it
up
with
the
question
of
an
injunction.
the
problem
of
enforcing;
two
problems,
one,
whether
a
violation
of
a
contract
should
itself
be
deemed
a
labor
--
unfair
labor
practice;
two,
what
the
remedies
were
put
for
independent
subject
matters
not
relating
to
301,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
out
of
it
came
this
--
whatever
you
call
that
--
this
thing
that
had
to
be
construed
by
this
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
after
301
has
evolved
out
of
that
legislative
process,
was
there
any
history
bearing
on
whether
301
was
construable
so
as
to
allow
it
to
be
a
--
concluding
out
of
which
the
silkworm
of
remedies
including
this
one
could
be
woven?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
was
that
--
yes,
i
know
it
did
and
that's
why
we're
here
now
but
was
there
any
legislative
light
bearing
on
the
scope
left
to
the
courts
in
dealing
with
301
so
as
to
say,
“well,
we
enforce
contractors,
this
may
--
you
may
go
into
a
federal
court
now
to
enforce
a
contract
with
a
federal
right
and
therefore
you
may
have
all
the
implements,
all
the
armamentarium
of
remedies
for
enforcing
a
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
terms,
they
weren't
doing
anything
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
[inaudible]
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
i
infer
from
what
you've
just
said
that
if
this
controversy
reached
a
magnitude
towards
the
--
permits
this
fragment
of
the
united
states
to
certify
it
as
a
national
emergency,
that
then
the
attorney
general
could
move
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
specific
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
couldn't
have
this
procedure
any
how?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
norris-laguardia
itself
had
some
of
the
restrictive
features
of
some
liberating
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
under
no
circumstances
ever
can
you
have
an
injunction
to
labor
disputes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
miller,
if
i
may
say
so,
you're
leaving
out
the
real
purpose
and
drive
and
force
behind
what
we
say
when
we
say
norris-laguardia
act.
it
was
the
concern
for
parties
at
tort;
it
was
a
concern
for
the
federal
courts
and
their
relations
to
local
cont
--
other
local
controversies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
just
as
valid
in
19
--
that
was
just
as
valid
in
1947
as
it
was
in
1932
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
when
we
have
a
statute
which
says
enforce,
we
must
shut
our
eyes
to
everything
else
except
to
say,
here
is
a
contract
between
two
people
and
enforce
--
usually
carries
with
it
not
only
damages,
damage
remedy
but
injunctive
remedy
and
that
we
must
shut
our
eyes
completely
to
a
consideration
which
was
wholly
unrelated
to
that
namely
the
place
of
the
federal
courts
in
our
scheme
of
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
enforce
means
mandatory
injunction,
specific
performance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
enforce
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
lots
of
--
lots
of
contracts
that
are
not
enforced
as
a
matter
of
balancing
conveniences
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
you
can
go
in
to
the
court
of
equity
will
refer
you
to
money
damages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
you
--
for
me
at
least,
you
have
to
address
yourself
to
the
exclusion
from
your
consideration
of
the,
for
me,
the
vital
facts
about
the
norris-laguardia
act
namely
the
restriction
upon
the
doing
of
things
by
the
federal
court
which
brought
them
into
dispute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
generally
in
this
dispute,
in
the
exercise
of
this
jurisdiction
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
butting
into
labor
controversy
which
really
belongs
to
the
state
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
agree
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
agree
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
it
says
that
with
the
driving
forces,
you
will
read
the
most
powerful
speech
in
the
senate,
for
that
matter
in
either
house
in
support
of
that
act,
it
is
from
senator
david
reed
from
pennsylvania,
one
of
the
most
conservative
men
then
in
politics
who
spoke
that
of
--
practitioner
of
extensive
practice
on
behalf
of
heavy
industry
in
which
he
said
forth
his
experience
why
it
was
undesirable
to
have
things
--
this
kind
of
litigation
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
show
me
a
single
statement
in
the
debate
on
the
taft-hartley
act
in
which
there's
any
indication
of
a
change
of
view
by
congress
that
the
federal
court
should
not
as
a
matter
of
equity
go
and
make
injunctive
relief
except
where
congress
specifically
made
that
change.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
some
of
it
--
there
were
some
specific
changes
that
they
particularized
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
judge
--
and
judge
clark
--
as
judge
clark
sets
forth
in
the
bull
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
miller,
you
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
talk
at
large,
the
--
what
the
house
proposed
they
threw
out
and
what
the
senate
did
was
restricted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
little
thing
like
that,
a
little
thing
like
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
say
that,
“we
leave
it
to
the
usual
process
of
the
law?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
usual
processes
of
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
words?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
discussing
of
--
without
any
record
to
the
norris-laguardia
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
any
reference
--
you
say
that
by
that
statement,
they
impliedly
repealed
the
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
different
story,
isn't
it?
if
that's
true
then
we
haven't
got
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
i'm
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
really
mr.
miller,
they
were
concerned
in
norris-laguardia
no
matter
how
[inaudible]
the
agreement
is,
you
cannot
get
in
an
injunction
in
a
labor
controversy
in
the
federal
court
subject
to
qualification
but
must
go
to
the
state
court
because
you
don't
want
to
embroil
the
federal
courts
in
this
kind
of
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
whether
it
did
it
by
way
of
injunction
is
the
issue
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
miller
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
a
matter
of
information,
kansas
has
a
little
norris-laguardia
act,
has
it?
when
was
it
passed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
not
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
kansas
doesn't
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
missouri
have
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
only
way
of
stating
the
problem
is
that
you
have
to
read
out
301?
is
that
the
real
issue
or
they
have
to
read
it
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
no
other
collocation
of
words
would
fairly
state
the
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
but
in
any
legal
--
if
anybody
can
decide
any
problem
--
if
only
one
principle
is
involved,
that's
easy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
every
question
--
every
question
that
comes
here
usually
has
a
multiplicity
of
factors
which
have
to
be
dealt
with
and
because
1947
is
later
than
1932,
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
language
of
1947
has
such
commanding
literalness
of
meaning
that
that
is
the
overriding
consideration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
you
come
to
--
come
to
the
question
when
we
deal
with
the
question
of
construing
a
statute
and
we
construe
it
one
way
rather
than
the
other,
i
suggest
respectfully
that
it
isn't
the
most
illuminating
way
of
putting
it
to
say
that
you
read
out
the
construction
that
you
find
is
not
in
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
maybe
for
you
but
not
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
as
i
say,
it's
a
question
of
construction,
and
when
i
have
one
statute
which
clearly
has
to
be
considered
with
another
statute,
i
don't
begin
with
either
the
reading
out
or
reading
in.
i
go
through
the
elaborate
complicated
process
of
finding
out
what
that
statute
means
and
when
i
have
found
that
in
relation
to
all
of
relevant
factors,
i
haven't
read
anything
out
that
i
have
concluded
isn't
in
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
an
ordinary
norris-laguardia
in
a
conventional
regarding
the
ordinary
--
leave
out
301
altogether
where
there
is
an
agreement
and
an
injunction
is
sought
which
was
enforceable
by
injunction
up
to
1932.
all
the
things
that
you
stress
so
much
that
you
have
a
collective
agreement
that
you've
got
an
enforceable
agreement
--
enforcement.
all
those
things
are
planned.
and
then
norris-laguardia
came
along
and
put
a
barrier
against
enforcement
to
injunction
not
because
you
didn't
have
an
ironclad
agreement,
but
because
--
in
my
point
of
view,
i
cannot
repeat
it
too
often
because
the
federal
courts
were
not
to
be
pulled
into
that
kind
of
a
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
were
also
--
the
state
of
--
laid
by
industrial
relations
was
a
little
different,
considerably
different
if
you
will
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
1932
from
what
it
wasn't,
1947
as
today,
but
even
1932,
there
were
outstanding
collective
bargaining
agreements.
to
my
knowledge,
the
unions
that
i
know
most
about,
the
amalgamated
clothing
workers
and
the
dress
and
waste
industry,
the
united
mine
workers,
they
were
collective
agreements
outstanding
and
an
injunction
was
brought
to
enforce
those
agreements
and
they
were
enforceable
by
injunction
and
specific
performance.
and
1932
came
along
and
put
a
stop
to
it
not
because
congress
wanted
to
minimize
the
integrity
of
contracts
or
the
duty
to
obey
them,
but
because
they
didn't
want
there
the
federal
courts
in
that
kind
of
litigation.
and
that
can't
be
said
to
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
before
norris-laguardia
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
didn't
take
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
--
and
you
think
they
didn't
go
to
the
federal
courts
to
try
to
enforce
them.
i
can
assure
you
from
personal
knowledge
with
the
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
that's
unrelated
to
the
problem
of
why
the
federal
courts
were
sought
to
be
withdrawn
from
this
area
of
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
[inaudible]
right
about
that.
