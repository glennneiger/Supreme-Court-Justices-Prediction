mr.
john
t.
chadwell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
indictment
in
this
case
against
mr.
wise,
the
government
does
not
deny
and
admits,
is
precisely
in
the
language
of
section
14
of
the
clayton
act,
reads
right
on
it
word
per
word.
now
that
act,
section
14,
imposes
criminal
liability
upon
corporate
officers,
directors,
or
agents.
in
other
words,
it
includes
everyone
who
could
possibly
act
for
a
corporation.
and
it
says,
whenever,
is
the
word
whenever,
anyone
of
these
corporate
officers,
directors
or
agents
shall
have
authorized
order
or
done,
authorized
order
or
done
any
act
constituting
in
whole
or
in
part,
in
whole
or
in
part,
a
corporate
violation,
the
officer
shall
be
punished
by
a
fine
not
exceeding
$5000.
now,
congress
in
that
act
in
1914
encompassed
every
possible
act
by
every
possible
corporate
agent
that
could
be
done
to
effectuate
a
corporate
violation
in
a
whole
or
in
part.
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
congress
to
have
passed
the
law
which
more
completely
encompassed
the
field
of
representative
action
on
the
part
of
a
corporate
employee
or
officer
than
they
did
when
they
adopted
section
14.
now,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
this
statute
clearly
covers
what
mr.
wise
is
alleged
to
have
done,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
comes
precisely
within
section
14,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
that
statute
provides
for
the
maximum
fine
of
$5000.
the
bold
proposition
of
the
government
in
this
case
is
that
the
department
of
justices
has
the
complete
unreviewable
discretion
to
decide
and
choose
to
prosecute
this
man
under
another
statute,
the
sherman
act,
which
makes
no
reference
in
terms
whatsoever
to
any
representative
act
by
anybody
which
in
nowhere
and
no
place
refers
to
any
corporate
officer,
director
or
employee,
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
that
statute
contains
a
maximum
fine
of
$50,000.
it
is
the
position
of
the
government
as
annunciated
by
mr.
wright
today
and
over
and
over
again
in
their
brief,
that
they
have
this
choice,
it's
not
a
judicial
choice,
it's
up
to
them
to
decided
whether
they're
going
to
prosecute
in
spite
of
the
circumstances
i
have
outlined
under
a
statute
that
could
cause
a
maximum
of
$5000
in
fines
or
a
maximum
of
$50,000
in
fines.
now,
the
--
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
under
those
circumstances,
the
government
is
required
to
prosecute
under
section
14.
now,
the
lower
court
held
that
the
government
is
so
required
to
prosecute
and
four
district
courts
in
different
districts
have
sense
agreed
with
the
lower
court
in
that
respect.
now,
the
government's
argument,
if
your
honors
please,
the
government's
argument
comes
down
to
this,
"we
have
been
using
section
1
to
prosecute
corporate
officers
and
directors
for
70
years.
no
court
ever
held
that
we
couldn't
do
it.
it's
now
pretty
late
for
a
defendant
to
come
into
court
when
he's
prosecuted
under
section
1
and
say,
we
--
i
should
have
been
prosecuted
under
section
14
which
carries
a
lesser
fine.
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
the
reason
obviously,
that
this
question
was
never
raised
before,
is
because
until
the
difference
in
fines
appeared
at
1955,
it
was
a
completely
academic
question.
what
difference
did
it
make
to
when
a
defendant
indicted
under
section
1
whether
in
a
corporate
--
whether
in
a
representative
capacity
or
not,
whether
he
should
have
been
indicted
under
section
14?
the
clients
are
very
practical
when
they're
in
litigation,
they're
considering
expense
and
time
and
everything
else,
why
should
they
spend
time
and
money
litigating
over
whether
section
1
or
section
14
applied
when
there's
no
question
that
one
did
and
when
the
fine
was
precisely
the
same
in
either
event?
now,
that's
why
it
wasn't
raised
before.
we
have
in
this
case,
if
your
honors
please,
we
have
the
situation
that
confronted
this
court
exactly
in
the
nashville
milk
case.
in
that
case,
it
had
been
assumed
for
a
number
of
years
since
section
of
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
was
adopted,
it
had
been
assumed
that
treble
damage
suits
could
be
filed
on
the
basis
of
section
3.
it
had
been
assumed
indeed
by
this
court
in
the
bruce's
juices
case
and
moore
against
mead
that
a
treble
damage
suits
would
lie
under
section
3.
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
section
3
came
within
the
antitrust
laws
so
as
to
make
it
possible
to
sue
--
to
sue
for
treble
damages
was
not
raised
directly
on
those
cases.
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
nashville
case
and
in
the
nashville
case,
this
court
held
that
you
couldn't
prosecute
a
treble
damage
suit
under
section
3
because
section
3
wasn't
a
part
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
i
say
that
the
argument
which
the
government
makes,
trying
to
lift
themselves
by
their
own
bootstraps
in
this
thing
saying,
"that
because
we've
made
this
mistake
for
70
years,
you
can't
challenge
us
now,"
makes
no
sense
when
the
fines
were
different
all
this
time.
now,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
your
honor.
that
contention
is
raised
and
i
say
to
the
--
to
the
court
and
i
--
and
we've
argued
this
and
briefed
it
thoroughly,
that
congress
said,
"no
such
thing,"
that
congress
did
not
have
the
view
that
at
anytime,
that
it
was
proper
to
prosecute
corporate
officers
acting
in
a
representative
capacity
under
section
1.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
legislative
history
shows
that
from
1890,
when
the
sherman
act
was
passed,
until
1914
when
the
clayton
act
was
passed,
there
were
51,
51
different
bills
introduced
in
the
congress
for
the
purpose
of
supplementing
or
amending
the
sherman
act
to
cover
corporate
--
or
representative
liability
by
corporate
officers.
one
of
them
passed
the
house
in
1900
and
in
the
report
of
the
judiciary
committee
to
the
house
in
support
of
that
bill,
the
statement
was
made
that
the
reason
it
was
passed
was
because
corporate
officers
or
representatives,
acting
in
a
representative
capacity,
were
not
covered
by
the
sherman
act
as
it
was
--
as
it
then
existed.
there
was
no
question
about
it,
if
your
honors
please,
on
the
basis
of
the
corporate
history
here.
i
--
i
strongly
assert
to
the
court,
there
was
no
question
that
congress
never
did
a
thing
by
virtue
of
these
bills,
these
steady
stream
of
bills
over
a
period
of
24
years.
they
never
did
think
that
individual
liability
of
persons
acting
in
a
corporate
capacity
was
subject
to
the
sherman
act.
as
--
as
a
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
continue
a
brief
response
to
your
honor's
question
if
i
may
at
the
outset.
the
government's
argument
as
to
what
congress
knew
and
didn't
knew
--
didn't
know
in
1955
when
the
fine
in
--
maximum
fine
with
respect
to
section
1
was
increased
to
$50,000
and
there
was
no
increase
in
the
fine
in
section
14
is
simply
not
borne
out
their
contention.
their
simply
not
borne
out
by
the
record,
by
the
reports
or
by
the
debates.
in
our
brief,
we
have
summarized
them
and
so
as
the
government,
each
as
might
be
expected
pointing
out
some
different
things
but
this
underlying
fact,
i
submit
to
the
court,
is
quite
obvious
from
those
debates
and
reports.
that
is,
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
the
inadequacy
of
the
maximum
fine
of
$5000
under
the
sherman
act
in
view
of
the
existence
of
large
corporations
and
with
large
assets
today.
that
was
the
burden
of
the
argument.
that
was
the
point
that
was
made.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
you
can
look
at
those
debates
from
beginning
to
end
in
vain
for
a
single
statement
anywhere
that
corporate
officers
were
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
and
therefore,
it
was
unnecessary
to
raise
the
fines
to
them.
there
was
a
reference
by
attorney
general
berkson
in
1950,
five
years
before
the
--
before
the
fines
were
raised
in
1955,
there
was
a
reference
by
him
as
to
the
importance
of
section
1
and
expressing
indifference
as
to
whether
the
fines
were
raised
under
section
14.
but
he
did
not
say
why.
the
reason
behind
the
statement
was
not
stated.
individuals
are
mentioned
from
time
to
time
in
the
debates,
but
obviously,
individuals
are
mentioned
in
connection
with
--
with
acts
done
by
them
in
their
individual
capacity,
not
acts
done
by
them
in
a
representative
capacity.
now,
in
hartford-empire
this
court
has
recognized
that
where
an
individual
performs
acts
strictly
in
a
representative
capacity
on
behalf
of
their
corporations.
court
recognized
that
they
could
be
indicted
under
section
14.
also,
the
court
held
in
hartford-empire
that
where
that
was
the
case,
an
injunction
should
not
run
against
the
individuals
personally,
but
only
against
the
corporations
and
their
officers,
directors,
and
employees
in
general.
that
was
expressly
held
in
hartford-empire,
that
recognition
of
the
very
real
difference
that
exist
between
charging
individual
defendants
with
engaging
in
conspiracies
on
their
own
behalf,
as
the
words
were
in
hartford-empire,
and
where
they
perform
acts
strictly
in
a
representative
capacity
on
behalf
of
their
corporation.
and
i
say
to
the
court,
in
connection
with
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
of
--
of
mr.
wright,
that
it's
obvious
and
it
always
has
been
obvious
in
--
in
--
in
the
history
of
the
sherman
act,
that
where
any
individual
is
indicted
in
a
representative
capacity,
strictly
for
performing
an
act
on
behalf
of
this
corporation
which
results
in
a
corporate
violation.
that
obviously,
he
is
not
guilty
unless
the
corporation
is
guilty,
he
couldn't
be,
he
never
has
been,
and
the
same
thing
is
true
under
section
14.
now
did
i
--
i
perhaps
have
misunderstood
mr.
wright's
statement,
but
i
understood
him
to
say
at
one
time,
that
under
section
14,
the
corporation
must
be
found
guilty
before
an
individual
can
be
indicted.
i
may
be
wrong
about
that,
but
the
fact
is
that
that
is
not
necessary.
it's
merely
necessary
that
the
act
done
by
the
individual
should
result
in
the
corporation
being
in
violation
of
the
act,
not
that
there
is
an
--
that
is
--
it's
necessary
to
be
any
finding
of
a
violation
by
the
corporation
or
a
finding
of
guilt
in
the
early
stages
of
the
section
14
history.
there
was
a
provision
requiring
of
finding
of
guilt
on
behalf
of
the
corporation,
but
that
is
out
in
the
--
and
has
been
out
ever
since
section
14
has
been
in
effect.
i
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
that's
true.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
but
it
would
--
would
--
oh
yes
indeed
sir
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
oh
yes.
no
--
no
question
about
that.
i
--
my
point
is
though
your
honor,
that
if
a
man
is
indicted
strictly
in
his
representative
capacity
--
strictly
in
his
representative
capacity
under
the
sherman
act,
he
could
not
be
guilty
of
violating
the
sherman
act
in
his
individual
capacity.
he
could
only
be
guilty
of
violating
it
in
his
corporate
capacity
or
his
representative
capacity
and
he
--
the
fact
that
he
violated
the
act
in
his
representative
capacity
would
mean
that
the
corporation
violated
the
act
that
does
--
the
--
the
result
is
precisely
the
same.
i
state
to
the
court
that
i've
argued
this
very
point
in
three
different
district
courts,
this
is
the
fourth
time
i've
argued
here
in
the
united
states
supreme
court.
i
have
yet
--
i
have
yet
to
hear
a
counsel
for
the
government
to
give
any
reason,
any
sensible
reason
why
congress
adopted
section
14.
they
say
there
was
some
provision
in
section
--
in
the
sherman
act
already,
there
were
some
individual
liability
in
the
sherman
act
already,
and
this
perhaps
was
to
reach
people
who
were
may
be
just
a
little
bit
guilty,
and
wouldn't
have
been
guilty
under
the
sherman
act,
but
now
they're
guilty
under
the
section
14.
i
say
that
congress
under
section
14
could
not
have
used
more
inclusive
and
complete
language
to
--
to
reach
every
violator
in
his
representative
capacity
whether
he
was
big
or
little,
whether
he
violated
it
just
a
little
bit
or
agree
to
you
when
they
use
the
words
that
they
did
use
which
i
reviewed
in
the
outset
of
my
remark
in
which
i
will
not
repeat.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
not
as
such.
now,
i
--
i
want
to
explain
that
exactly
as
--
as
i
understand
the
fact's
worth.
in
the
first
place,
of
great
many
of
the
cases
upon
which
the
government
relies,
winslow,
patterson,
to
which
reference
was
made
in
mr.
wright's
argument,
swift
and
--
and
others,
it
is
clear
that
the
individuals
were
indicted
in
their
individual
capacity
for
individual
conspiracies
on
their
own
account.
indeed,
in
the
winslow
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
the
solicitor
general
argued
that
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
reaches
individuals
where
they
act
in
their
own
capacity
and
use
the
corporation
as
a
mere
guise
or
façade
for
their
individual
activities.
now,
that
was
the
argument
made,
and
that
explanation
can
be
made
of
the
great
majority
of
the
cases
that
the
government
cites,
the
pre-1914
cases.
now,
there
--
there
was
an
argument
in
a
number
of
cases
since
1914
to
the
effect
that
an
indictment
was
duplicitous
--
was
duplicitous
because
the
corporations
were
indicted
and
the
individuals
were
indicted
under
section
1
who
were
indicted
in
the
same
count.
and
the
argument
was,
not
that
they
couldn't
be
indicted
under
section
1,
but
that
they
couldn't
be
indicted
in
the
same
count
of
section
--
as
the
corporation
because
they
would
have
had
--
had
been
indicted
under
section
14
in
the
--
and
of
--
and
the
corporations
under
section
1.
the
court
never
did
pass
on
that
question
directly.
there
has
not
a
single
case,
i
submit
to
the
court,
in
which
a
lower
court
has
held
or
the
supreme
court
has
held,
directly
what's
involved
here
that
the
individuals
can
only
be
indicted
and
--
and
prosecuted
and
--
and
--
and
convicted
under
section
14
where
they
act
in
the
representative
capacity.
not
a
single
one.
we
have
reviewed
each
one
of
these
cases
which
the
government
has
cited
in
their
brief.
it
would
take
too
long
to
review
them
here
but
i
think
i
can
dispose
of
them
in
--
in
one
of
two
general
categories.
one
is,
they
were
indicted
in
their
individual
capacities
and
as
in
patterson
and
others,
operated
under
individual
capacities,
and
the
other
was
where
the
court
held
as
they
did
in
general
motors,
and
as
they
did
in
--
in
one
or
two
other
cases,
atlantic
commission,
that
you
couldn't
tell
from
the
phase
of
the
indictment
whether
the
individuals
were
indicted
in
their
corporate
capacity
or
not.
and
therefore,
the
question
could
not
be
raised
on
the
phase
of
the
indictment.
now,
i
want
to
make
a
reference,
if
your
honors
please,
to
the
barrett
case.
i
believe
that
the
statement
made
by
his
honor,
mr.
justice
black,
in
the
dissenting
opinion
written
in
the
barrett
case
is
precisely
opposite
here
and
the
majority
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
reach
the
point.
and
if
that
in
that
case
which
our
court
will
recall
was
an
income
tax
evasion
case.
the
government
took
the
position
that
the
individual,
though
there
was
a
difference
in
the
penalties,
could
be
indicted
either
under
a
general
act
against
defrauding
the
government
out
of
income
taxes
or
specific
act
against
filing
false
returns.
and,
though
the
majority
held
that
the
point
was
not
before
them
on
the
procedural
aspect
of
the
matter
in
the
descending
opinion
there,
the
statement
is
made
to
which
the
majority
did
not
disagree
that
the
basic
principle
that
a
--
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
fair
notice
as
to
the
conduct
charged
to
be
illegal
and
the
punishment
to
be
administered,
would
be
administered,
is
flouted
if
either
statute
can
be
chosen
by
the
attorney
general
at
his
unregulated
whim
as
to
which
one
should
form
the
basis
for
the
indictment.
and
the
further
statement
was
made
that
no
such
intent
should
be
attributed
to
congress
in
the
absence
of
clear
command.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
there's
no
such
clear
command
here
as
i
shall
demonstrate,
and
as
i
wish
to
mention
in
connection
with
the
corporate
history
of
--
of
the
sherman
act.
i
have
mentioned
the
fact,
if
your
--
if
the
court
please,
that
under
the
sherman
act,
the
--
there
were,
after
the
adoption
of
the
sherman
act,
have
great
many
bills
introduced
in
congress
to
take
care
of
this
subject
of
corporate
representation
which
it
was
thought
and
was
not
covered
by
the
act
as
it
then
--
as
it
then
existed
and
still
exist.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
of
those
bills,
51
of
them
were
introduced
through
the
years,
pointed
that
out.
the
committee
report
in
1900
to
the
house
of
representatives,
contained
the
expressed
provision
that
the
reason
for
the
bill,
which
would
have
amended
section
8,
defining
person.
the
reason
for
it
is
that
the
action
of
a
corporate
official
as
an
agent,
also
an
attorney,
does
not
subject
them
to
the
penalties
under
the
law
today.
that's
expressly
stated
in
the
house
report
at
that
time.
now,
it
--
it
appears
that
the
government
is
arguing
here
that
the
aider
and
abettor
doctrine
ought
to
apply.
that
argument
is
laid
to
rest,
i
submit
to
the
court,
but
on
--
on
two
bases
and
the
first
one
i
want
to
refer
very
briefly
is
the
dotterweich
case.
in
the
dotterweich
case,
there
was
an
indictment
under
the
food
and
drug
act.
the
food
and
drug
act
contained
a
definition
of
person
as
being
an
individual
partnership
association
or
corporation.
now,
it
was
held
both
in
the
majority
opinion
and
in
the
minority
opinion,
in
that
case,
that
that
language
did
not
reach
corporate
representatives
acting
in
their
corporate
capacity
and
their
representative
capacity,
both
the
majority
and
the
minority
agreed
on
that.
there
was
a
disagreement
as
to
whether
the
aid
--
the
general
aider
and
abettor
statute
as
--
as
applied.
the
majority
holding
that
it
did.
the
minority
holding
that
it
should
not
apply.
now
then,
the
question
is,
does
the
aider
and
abettor
statute
apply
here
to
bring
it
under
the
sherman
act?
is
there
any
basis
upon
which
it
can
be
contended
here
that
the
aider
and
abettor
statute
should
apply?
i
say
to
the
court
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
14
shows
beyond
any
question
that
congress
not
only
preempted
every
single
aspect
of
this
subject
of
corporate
representation
in
the
very
words
of
section
14.
but
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
they
meant
to
do
so
and
they
specifically
rejected
the
aider
and
abettor
doctrine.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
opposition
to
section
14,
in
congress
in
--
in
1914,
took
two
general
theories.
the
first
was
that
the
general
aider
and
abettor
statute
applied
now
anyway
so
you
don't
need
that
--
don't
need
the
act.
the
second
was,
an
amendment
offered
by
representative
volstead,
which
would
have
applied
directly
to
the
sherman
--
to
the
antitrust
laws,
the
gen
--
or
the
--
a
sherman,
an
aider
and
abettor
doctrine.
that
was
the
volstead
act,
the
volstead
bill.
the
volstead
bill
incorporating
that
aider
and
abettor
theory
was
voted
down
by
the
house
on
the
very
day
that
the
house
voted
section
14
as
it
is
now
on
the
book,
the
very
day.
an
aider
and
abettor
bill
as
a
substitute
for
section
14
was
introduced
in
the
senate
and
discussed
and
it
was
not
passed.
congress
could
not
have
more
specifically
declared
its
intention
that
this
section
14
was
to
be
the
complete
and
thorough
coverage
that
it
is,
and
that
the
aider
and
abettor
doctrine
did
not
apply
to
it
and
should
not
apply
to
antitrust
violations
in
the
future.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
dotterweich,
there
had
been
a
--
an
authorized,
ordered
or
done
bill
introduced
with
respect
to
the
food
and
drug
act
which
was
voted
down.
and
the
majority
held
that
that
left
the
aider
and
abettor
doctrine
in
effect.
a
conclusion
which
was
the
subject
of
the
dissent
as
i
have
mentioned.
now,
i
want
to
point
this
out
also,
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
--
the
definite
--
the
very
words
of
the
sherman
act
are
that
the
defendants
that
--
that
--
that
a
party
who
shall
make
a
contract,
who
shall
engage
in
a
conspiracy,
a
person
who
shall
monopolize
or
attempt
to
monopolize
under
sections
1
and
2.
a
person
who
shall
do
those
things
is
guilty
of
violating
the
sherman
act.
now,
only
an
--
only
a
principal
can
make
a
contract,
an
agent
doesn't
make
a
contract
except
on
behalf
of
the
principal.
an
agent
doesn't
monopolize,
it's
the
principal
that
monopolizes.
so
that
congress
came
along
in
section
8
and
they
defined
what
they
mean
of
a
person.
and
congress
defined
what's
meant
by
a
person
in
this
passion,
it
shall
include
corporations
and
associations.
nowhere
in
the
definition,
is
there
any
reference
to
corporate
representatives,
to
officers,
directors
or
agents.
nowhere
is
there
any
such
reference
in
the
definition
of
person
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
said,
every
effort
to
--
to
supply
that
deficiency
failed
until
1914
when
it
was
supplied
by
section
14
of
the
clayton
act
as
an
entirely
separate
and
supplemental
act.
now
we
don't
argue
that
section
14
amends
the
sherman
act
or
repeals
the
sherman
act,
i
say
that
it
supplements
the
sherman
act.
and
it
furnishes
a
--
a
liability,
a
representative
liability
which
did
not
exist
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
14
in
1914.
this,
i
would
say
to
the
court,
was
recognized
not
only
by
reason
of
a
congressional
action
on
section
14
and
their
turndown
of
the
volstead
aider
and
abettor
act,
it
was
recognized
by
president
wilson,
who
addressed
congress
in
person
and
who
said,
we
quote
from
his
address
in
our
--
in
our
brief,
who
said,
"in
urging
congress
to
adopt
the
clayton
act,
and
with
specific
reference
to
what
subsequently
became
section
14,
one
that
the
--
the
law
should
make
corporate
representatives
individually
responsible”
and
he
said,
"one
of
the
main
objects
of
our
legislation
should
be
to
divest
such
persons
of
their
corporate
cloak."
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes
sir
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
that
any
corporation
obviously,
or
any
principal
whether
he'd
be
an
individual,
as
in
the
winslow
case,
acting
on
his
own
behalf,
or
whether
if
the
partnership
or
association
or
corporation,
any
one
of
them
acting
on
their
own
behalf
could
be
the
fact
that
he
was
an
individual,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
would
in
no
way
exempting
--
exempt
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no
sir.
i
say
if
an
individual
who's
an
officer
of
the
company,
acts
on
his
own
behalf
and
not
in
a
representative
capacity,
if
that
is
clear
then
he
could
be
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
but
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes
sir.
in
some
--
i
don't
think
it's
very
--
i
don't
think
it's
very
likely
that
he
could
do
it.
but
in
some
of
the
cases,
that
was
true
in
the
general
motors
case,
it
was
true
in
the
atlantic
commission
case,
the
reference
was
made
to
the
fact
that
a
mere
description
of
a
defendant,
in
an
indictment,
as
an
officer
of
general
motors
corporation
for
example,
is
not
in
itself
an
allegation
that
he
acted
in
a
representative
capacity.
he
could
so
describe,
have
been
acting
individual
was
the
--
was
the
statement
made
by
the
court
in
that
case.
i
say
that
reasoning
however,
in
the
general
motors
case,
cannot
apply
here
because
the
lower
court
has
construed
this
indictment
to
be
limited
to
acts
done
in
a
representative
capacity
and
indeed,
the
government
does
not
contest
that,
and
indeed,
admitted
it
to
be
so
in
the
bill
of
particulars
which
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well
i
--
i
don't
think
they
can
be
prosecuted
under
both.
now
if
they
are
prosecuted
under
both,
i
think
that
a
motion
to
strike
would
lie,
with
respect
to
the
account
containing
the
section
1
charge.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes
sir,
that's
what
i
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
are
you
asking
me
--
just
so
i
may
understand
your
honor.
are
you
asking
me
of
whether
congress
could
vest
this
discretion
on
the
attorney
general?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
the
remedy
is
the
one
that
we
availed
ourselves
here
moving
to
dismiss.
because
i
--
i
say
that
if
we
don't
move
to
dismiss
that
the
outset,
we
get
ourselves
into
the
problem
that
--
that
was
--
that
confronted
the
defendant
in
the
--
in
the
barrett
case
where
you
might
not
be
able
to
raise
it
properly
at
the
trial.
and
i
say
this
furthermore,
it
is
very
possible
that
in
some
of
these
cases,
an
individual
so
indicted
in
his
representative
capacity
might
wish
to
tender
a
nolo
plea,
that's
done
quite
frequently
as
your
honor
recognizes.
i
think
when
he
does
so,
and
judge
watkins
recognized
this
in
his
opinion
in
the
--
in
the
milk
distributors
case
in
baltimore.
when
he
does
so,
he
is
entitled
to
know
whether
the
maximum
fine
is
$5000
or
$50,000
and
that
i
think
it
would
be
a
serious
prejudice
to
him
unless
he
does
know,
and
that
is
the
reason
i
think
that
a
motion
to
dismiss
is
the
proper
remedy,
and
the
one
we
have
availed
ourselves
here.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
authorized
--
yes
sir.
authorized
your
order
and
the
court
construed
that
to
mean
that
he
was
limited
that
--
that
the
indictment
is
limited
to
charging
him
in
his
representative
capacity.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i'd
--
i
--
i
would
not
like
to
take
that
chance.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
you're
getting
in
then
to
--
to
the
question
raised
by
--
perhaps
by
section
7
(c)
of
the
rules.
i
say
there
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes
sir.
i
think
that
the
way
to
raise
this
is
the
way
we
did
raise
it
because
the
indictment
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action
if
it
purports
to
be
under
section
1
and
here
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
suppose
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
you
could
move
--
you
could
move
to
limit
the
fine
if
there
was
some
attempt
to
charge
more
than
that
or
to
--
to
fine
more
than
that
i
presume.
but
i
say
that
in
a
--
in
an
indictment
of
this
kind,
you've
got
both
the
corporation
and
the
individual
indicted
in
one
count
thus
the
section
1
obviously
under
the
sherman
act
of
course
as
to
the
corporation.
and
the
individual
i
see
under
section
14
which
makes
the
count
bad
to
start
with
as
being
duplicitous
under
the
very
--
under
the
very
provisions
of
section
8.
i
just
want
to
make
this
additional
statement
that
senator
culberson,
who
is
in
charge
of
this
bill,
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee
of
dissent,
made
a
statement
in
his
argument
--
in
his
argument
to
the
senate
precisely
upon
the
argument
we're
making
now,
that
the
sherman
act
as
it
then
existed,
did
not
cover
corporate
executives
acting
in
a
--
a
representative
capacity
and
therefore
this
section
14
was
needed.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well
in
--
in
trenton
potteries,
the
--
there
was
of
course
a
section
1
in
--
indictment
but
this
court
nor
any
court
passed
on
the
question
which
is
before
the
court
now
that
there
was
no
decision,
if
your
honor
please,
at
that
time
that
section
14
was
the
proper
remedy
for
a
corp
--
for
a
corporate
officer
acting
only
in
his
representative
capacity,
it
was
not
raised.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it
was
not
raised
sir,
and
the
reason
was
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes
sir
there
were
a
number
of
them
but
the
question
was
not
raised
there,
and
the
reason
that
it
was
not
raised
i
--
i
submit
to
the
court
was
the
reason
i
stated
the
outset,
namely
that
it
made
no
difference
in
the
fine
and
there
were
--
would
have
been
raising
as
they
thought
an
academic
matter.
i
thank
the
court.
