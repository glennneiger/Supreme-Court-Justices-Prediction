mr.
robert
l.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
appeal
is
from
the
dismissal
of
a
corporate
officer
from
the
sherman
act
indictment.
the
dismissed
defendant
wise
is
vice
president
and
director
of
the
defendant,
national
dairy's
corporation.
he
and
his
corporation
were
charged
with
conspiring
with
other
persons
to
fix
prices
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
wise
was
the
only
individual
defendant
and
was
alleged
to
be
actively
engaged
to
manage
with
direction
and
control
of
national
business.
he
was
charged
with
having
to
authorize
order
conduct
that
implicated
his
employer.
the
justice
department
has
been
prosecuting
corporate
officers,
who
are
responsible
for
corporate
sherman
act
violations
under
the
sherman
act
for
70
years.
but
the
district
court
held
in
this
case,
this
practice
was
stopped.
from
now
on,
the
court
below
says,
"such
officers
can
only
be
prosecuted
under
the
clayton
act."
this
holding
rest
primarily
on
a
misconception
as
to
what
the
clayton
act
was
supposed
to
do,
although
that
act
is
described
in
its
title
as
the
supplement
to
the
sherman
act,
the
court
held
that
congress
met
instead
to
amend
the
sherman
act.
in
other
words,
what
the
congress
itself
described,
as
an
addition
to
existing
to
antitrust
law
liability
was
wrongly
construed
as
replacing
the
existing
liability.
the
history
of
the
relevant
legislation
in
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
applicable
case
law
is
fully
set
out
in
our
briefs.
all
that
i'm
going
to
try
to
show
here
is
that
the
practical
effect
of
the
decision
is
exactly
contrary
to
what
congress
intended
when
it
passed
the
clayton
act
in
1914
and
amended
the
sherman
act
in
1955.
i
propose
to
do
this
by
first
describing
the
pre-1914
practice
in
prosecuting
corporate
officers
for
sherman
act
violations.
i
shall
then
discuss
the
continuance
of
the
same
practice
for
the
next
40
years
with
the
implied
approval
of
congress
and
finally
show
an
explicit
approval
of
those
practice
in
1955
when
congress
increased
the
maximum
sherman
act
fine
from
$5000
to
$50,000.
before
1914,
40
sherman
act
indictments
have
been
returned
against
corporate
officers
or
agents,
10
are
which
named
only
the
individuals
without
making
their
corporations
defendants.
the
illegal
conduct
charge
against
these
individuals
have
undertaken
on
behalf
of
their
corporations
but
in
no
case
was
it
essential
to
establish
a
violation
by
the
corporation
that
already
convicted
the
individual.
although
both
were
charged
with
the
same
sherman
act
offense,
the
liability
of
each
was
subsequently
determined
at
trial.
diverse
in
such
indictments
have
been
overruled
on
the
ground
to
the
corporate
officer,
who
aids
or
abets
this
corporation
in
the
commission
of
a
misdemeanor,
is
just
as
guilty
as
this
corporation.
that's
a
common
law
rule.
it
was
expressly
applied
to
all
federal
crimes
by
the
aiders
and
abettors
statute
in
1909.
violations
of
the
sherman
act
are
almost
had
been
misdemeanors.
these
40
indictments
are
identified
in
appendix
a
of
our
main
brief
and
i'll
only
describe
one
here
to
illustrate
the
three
clayton
act
practice.
this
was
the
1912
indictment
of
30
officers
and
agents
of
the
national
cash
register
company
for
conspiring
to
monopolize
the
cash
register
business
for
that
corporation.
in
addition
to
its
president,
patterson,
and
the
principle
sales
officials,
the
indictment
included
12
branch
managers.
all
were
charged
to
interrupt
the
valid
capacity
and
were
convicted,
44
were
sentenced
to
a
year
in
jail
of
1913.
these
convictions
were
on
appeal
during
the
entire
debate
on
the
bill
that
became
the
clayton
act.
and
the
clayton
act
debate
leaves
no
doubt
that
the
congress
unanimously
favored
continuance
of
sherman
act
prosecutions
of
that
kind.
these
debates
showed
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
the
corporation
was
not
indicted,
it's
not
a
defendant.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
these
debates
show
that
both
sides
agreed
that
it
was
desirable
to
extend
the
criminal
liability
of
corporate
officers.
no
one
wanted
to
contract
it.
no
one
advocated
any
repeal
or
restriction
of
their
existing
sherman
act
liability.
section
14
was
inserted
in
clayton's
bill
when
that
bill's
prohibitions
against
price
discrimination,
time
clauses,
stock
acquisitions,
and
interlocking
directorates
for
penal
offenses.
that's
the
way
it
passed
the
house.
but
the
senate
made
substantial
changes
at
section
14
lawsuits'
original
significance
when
the
conference
made
the
substantive
provisions
non-penal.
the
final
result
was
that
section
14
added
nothing
to
the
clayton
act
liability
of
the
corporate
officers.
it
did
add,
however,
to
their
sherman
act
liability.
but
this
add
at
section
14
liability
in
contrast
to
the
existing
sherman
act
liability,
was
condition
to
file
an
antitrust
law
violation
by
the
official's
corporation.
it
was,
therefore,
less
effective
remedy
than
the
sherman
act.
no
officer
could
be
convicted
under
section
14
without
a
prior
finding
of
a
violation
of
wise
corporation,
no
matter
how
flagrant
the
individual
officers'
old
conduct
might
be.
this
was
understood
by
the
congress,
and
judge
floyd
charged
the
bill
in
the
house
and
had
to
assure
the
house
that
section
14
would
not
disturb
the
existing
sherman
act
liability
in
order
to
get
the
conference
bill
passed.
if
section
14
had
actually
superseded
the
existing
sherman
act
remedy,
it
would
have
repudiated
instead
of
responded
to
president
wilson's
request
for
greater
antitrust
penalties
against
the
individuals
responsible
for
corporate
violations.
wilson
had
told
the
congress
that
the
officers
and
directors
of
great
business
bodies,
who
were
responsible
for
antitrust
law
violations,
should
themselves
bear
the
stigma
of
these
violations
instead
of
their
corporations.
this
could
only
be
done
by
preserving
the
existing
sherman
act
liability
of
those
officers.
a
sherman
act
indictment
would
permit
conviction
of
the
officials
without
a
finding
of
violation
by
their
corporation,
a
section
14
indictment
would
not.
the
department
of
justice,
therefore,
continued
to
prosecute
corporate
officers
acting
in
the
representative
capacity
under
the
sherman
act,
frequently,
without
naming
their
corporation
as
the
defendant
as
in
the
cash
register
case.
there
were
no
prosecutions
under
section
14,
and
the
congress
was
kept
fully
advised
as
this
is
nonuse
of
section
14
and
the
continued
exclusive
use
of
the
sherman
act
in
prosecuting
corporate
officers.
an
indictment
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
very
little,
it
was
obvious
that
you
--
that
you
cannot
determine
what
can
be
reached
until
and
unless
you
prosecute
under
section
14.
there
has
been
no
prosecution
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
can
conceive
of
instances
that
might
be
reached
under
14
where
the
officers'
connection
with
the
offense
was
rather
remote,
but
it's
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it's
a
matter
of
--
of
question
of
fact
how
--
how
close
he
is
to
the
illegal
conduct.
i
don't
think,
however,
that
it's
--
it's
necessary
to
determine
that
here.
this
is
after
all
the
sherman
act
indictment,
and
if
i'm
right
in
my
contentions,
14
was
supplementary
legislation
as
the
clayton
act
does.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
for
the
purpose
of
this
indictment,
what
additional
offense
of
14
might
cover.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
there's
no
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
there's
no
dispute
here
about
the
fact
that
14
overlaps.
we
don't
say
we
couldn't
have
prosecuted
wise
under
14.
we
simply
say
that
we
didn't'
have
to
be
the
--
the
view
of
the
court
below.
the
argument
is
here
that
14,
instead
of
providing
a
supplemental
additional
remedy,
actually
was
a
substitute
remedy
for
the
existing
sherman
act
liability.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
precisely.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
this
is
what
they
said
they
did.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
section
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
section
14
initially
as
i
just
pointed
out
was
in
the
bill
as
a
supplement
to
the
clayton
act
liability
that
was
being
established
for
the
first
time
by
this
--
the
time
clause
and
the
similar
price
discrimination
provisions.
then,
as
--
when
the
senate
changed
the
bill
and
it
went
to
conference,
these
provisions
--
clayton
act
provisions
to
which
it
have
the
initial
application,
were
made
non-penal.
the
result
was,
that
when
it
--
the
bill
came
out
of
conference,
section
14
had
only
a
--
a
sherman
act
liability
and
that
is
why
it
was
important.
in
the
final
debates
for
representative
floyd
to
give
the
assurances
that
are
quoted
in
appendix
b
of
our
main
brief
there
that
the
existing
sherman
act
liability
was
not
being
disturbed.
now,
that
--
the
legislation
itself
was
identified
by
congress
as
supplementary.
and
what
i
show
it
here
is
that's
the
way
it
has
to
be
construed
to
make
sense
out
of
it.
an
indictment
somewhere
to
the
cash
register
indictment
was
the
turn
in
1960,
against
16
officers
of
nine
companies
who
had
been
engaged
in
fixing
the
price
support
and
submit.
none
of
those
companies
was
a
defendant.
the
more
of
that
indictment
was
overruled
and
the
majority
of
the
defendants
pleaded
guilty.
two
defendants
who
elected
to
stay
in
trial
were
convicted
and
their
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
there
was
no
determination
of
the
antitrust
liability
to
their
companies.
if
their
sherman
act
liability
had
in
fact
been
superseded
by
section
14,
these
officials
were
improperly
convicted.
and
if
congress
had
contended
section
14
to
be
the
only
statute
under
which
officers
acting
for
their
corporations
could
be
prosecuted,
it
seems
likely
that
congress
would
have
hold
of
the
justice
department's
continued
use
of
the
sherman
act
for
this
purpose,
just
as
so
the
congress
found
out
about.
but
congress
has
never
objected
to
that
practice,
although
it's
been
repeatedly
brought
to
congress's
attention
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
right
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no,
i
don't
think
that
there
has
to
be
criminal
of
--
the
--
the
corporation
doesn't
have
to
be
indicted
and
found
guilty
but
there
must
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
--
be
at
least
an
allegation.
yes,
there
must
be
a
fine
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
--
in
corporate
violations.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
yes,
by
the
corporations.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
now
that's
what
the
defendant
said.
i
think
it's
rather
difficult
for
me
to
visualize
these
12
branch
managers
as
people
who
were
manipulating
the
--
the
corporation
for
their
own
benefit.
i
think
quite
clearly
that
at
least
as
far
as
they
were
concerned,
whatever
they
did
was
being
done,
they
will
represent
capacity
for
the
cash
register
company
and
not
to
further
any
purpose
of
their
own,
except
this
--
i
suppose
any
corporate
officer
who
is
doing
something
that
he
thinks
is
going
to
be
profitable
for
the
company
or
help
the
company
is
at
the
same
furthering
result
personal
interest
in
that
respect
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it
certainly
did,
the
indictment
--
the
indictment
charges
them
specifically
in
representative
capacity
and
that's
what
the
eviden
--
the
evidence
was.
no
question
at
all
about
the
cash
register
defendants,
having
been
indicted
and
convicted
on
the
basis
of
what
they
were
doing
for
the
national
--
national
cash
register
corporation.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
i
should
suppose
that
that
may
have
been
feeling
somewhere
to
that
--
that
president
wilson
expressed.
they
felt
that
to
these
violations
are
--
were
of
such
flagrant
character
that
it
would
--
perhaps
be
unjust
to
the
stockholders
to
visit
the
penalty
on
the
corporation,
it
would
be
preferable
to
visit
it
on
the
individuals.
by
the
--
by
the
time
congress
increased
the
maximum
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
i
suppose
we
have
to
take
some
account
of
the
--
the
feelings
of
jurors.
if
you
--
if
you
prosecute
under
section
14,
you
go
to
the
jury
under
periphery
instruction
that
says,
"unless
you
find
that
the
corporation
is
guilty
of
a
violation,
you
don't
even
reach
the
liability
of
corporate
officers."
now,
it
might
be
that
in
certain
circumstances,
the
judge
or
jury
would
feel
that
the
corporate
officer
had
--
while
everything
he
had
done
had
been
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation,
had
engaged
in
conduct
of
such
a
nature
on
the
corporation's
behalf
that
he
should
be
penalized
for
it
and
the
corporation
should
not.
this
is
the
kind
of
--
of
fair
apply
judgment
that
juries
are
making
everyday.
they
don't
necessarily
convict
everyone
that
might
properly
be
convicted.
and
this
is
really
what
wanted
to
state
here
on
this
appeal
is
the
question
of
whether
you're
going
to
make
it
harder
or
easier
to
convict
to
corporate
official
--
officials.
there
isn't
any
question
at
all
to
what
drive
us
from
it
--
passed
the
clayton
act
they
thought
it
was
making
it
easier.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
there
was
one
indictment
which
was
dismissed,
that
was
subsequent
to
1955,
that
was
in
1956.
no
one
has
actually
got
a
trial
under
14.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
oh
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
to
supply
an
additional
alternative
remedy.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
not
utilized.
no.
by
the
time
congress,
they
got
around
with
increasing
the
maximum
sherman
act
fine
from
$5000
to
$50,000
in
1955,
more
than
a
hundred
corporate
officers
acting
in
the
representative
capacity
had
been
indicted
under
the
sherman
act
of
a
large
number
that's
been
convicted.
none
had
been
charged
under
section
14.
no
court
suggested
that
section
14,
it
superseded
the
sherman
act
and
the
statutes
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
perhaps
it's
easier
as
the
(inaudible).
they
didn't
make
the
--
the
government's
job
wasn't
made
anymore
difficult
but
--
because
the
existing
sherman
act
probably
that
was
--
was
preserved.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
they
didn't
touch
the
sherman
act,
only
they
did
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
that's
what
it
says
on
its
phase.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes,
and
that's
what
it
is.
what
it
does
is
hold
out
the
premise
of
a
lesser
standard
of
proof
being
required
to
connect
the
corporate
officer.
but
in
exchange,
you
must
--
the
liability's
condition
and
the
corporation's
guilt.
but
viewed
as
--
viewed
as
a
supplemental
additional
remedy,
this
represented
no
--
no
interference,
no
lessening
of
existing
liability.
it
did
--
it
did
represent
a
broad
mean
in
the
sense
that
you
had
this
new
additional
remedy
of
proceeding
against
the
corporate
officer.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
i
think
if
you
--
if
you
look
at
the
factual
considerations
involved,
you
can
see
why.
there
isn't
anybody
that
you
can
really
reach
under
the
standards
of
14
who
is
tremendously
important,
14
what's
--
what
14
would
do,
would
be
to
sweep
in
perhaps
minor
officials
or
officials
with
a
remote
connection
with
the
act.
the
problem
in
convicting
the
corporate
officers
is
always
to
persuade
the
court
of
jury
to
convict
any.
in
practice,
we
do
of
course
always
try
to
limit
the
individuals.
we
select
those
or
the
grand
jury
selects
those
who
it
regards
as
having
primary
responsibility
for
the
offense
as
a
practical
manner.
i
think
convictions
under
section
14
trying
to
--
trying
to
get
at
somebody
under
14
really
wasn't
--
didn't
have
any
primary
responsibility,
just
wouldn't
be
a
very
useful
thing
to
do
in
terms
of
sherman
act
enforcement,
we've
never
done
it.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes
indeed.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
that's
quite
correct
your
honor.
as
i
said,
those
things
could
only
relegate
determine
in
a
section
14
prosecution.
clearly,
i
think
that
they
aren't
presented
here,
where
the
indictment
is
of
the
sherman
act.
as
i
pointed
out,
in
'55,
when
the
penalty
was
--
was
raised,
there
could
no
use
at
all
of
14,
congress
knew
this,
and
it
knew
that
the
only
--
only
prosecutions
of
officers
had
been
under
the
sherman
act.
now,
when
congress
first
considered
raising
the
antitrust
law
maximum
fines
in
1950,
it
was
told
by
the
justice
department
that
no
increase
in
--
no
increase
in
the
section
14
fine
was
needed
because
this
section
was
unused.
congress
accordingly
limited
the
increase
to
the
sherman
act
and
all
of
the
bills
subsequently
introduced
for
this
purpose
including
the
one
that
became
law
on
the
spring
of
1955.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
that's
explicitly
pointed
out
both
for
me
in
the
original
brief
and
the
reply
brief.
it
was
also
told
--
congress
has
also
told
1950
by
the
justice
department
that
the
proposed
increase
from
$5000
to
$50,000
was
especially
needed
to
deter
corporate
officers.
no
one
suggested
that
corporate
officers
ought
to
be
exempted
from
it.
now,
the
entire
house
debate
on
the
1955
amendment
took
place
on
march
29th
and
takes
up
less
than
seven
pages
of
the
congressional
record.
the
debate
opened
with
the
statement
by
representative
rogers
at
colorado
that
the
purpose
of
the
increase
was
to
give
the
court's
discretion
to
make
the
punishment
fit
the
crime
for
which
the
individual
and
i
emphasize
individual
or
the
corporation,
may
have
been
convicted.
congress
went
so
and
then
inserted
in
the
debate
a
tabulation
of
all
convictions
of
imprisonment
under
the
antitrust
laws,
down
to
february
15,
1955.
and
that
tabulation
makes
clear
that
the
individuals
under
discussion
included
corporate
officers
acting
in
the
representative
capacity.
among
the
convicted
individuals
are
listed
to
seven
corporate
officers
in
the
trenton
potteries
case,
all
convicted
for
directing
the
price
fixing
activities
of
their
corporation,
who
received
jail
sentences
of
from
six
to
10
months
in
1923.
and
again,
as
in
the
1914
clayton
act
debate,
the
only
opposition
to
this
amendment
was
based
on
applying
that
the
little
legislations
didn't
make
it
fairly
severe
enough.
now,
when
congress,
in
1955,
deliberately
declined
to
amend
the
unused
clayton
act
provision
and
shows
instead
to
amend
the
sherman
act,
that
amendment
ought
to
be
construed
in
accordance
with
that
statute,
the
sherman
act's
prior
actual
used.
so
construed,
the
sherman
act
covered
wise's
allege
defense
beyond
any
doubt
and
the
dismissal
of
his
indictment
was
plain
error.
i
would
like
if
i
might
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
first
that
it's
not
to
my
experience
the
technical
defects
of
an
indictment
with
regard
to
as
an
academic
matter
by
defense
counsel.
i
have
traditionally
--
all
that's
been
raised
that
every
opportunity
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
it
is
not
an
explanation
at
all
of
the
failure
to
raise
before
--
that
the
fines
were
the
same.
the
reason
that
it
wasn't
raised
is
because
people
who
are
closer
to
the
event
never
supposed
that
14
could
be
put
to
this
kind
of
defensive
views.
now,
i
may
have
misled
mr.
justice
stewart
when
i
referred
simply
two
cases
which
did
not
involve
corporate
defendants
in
illustrating
the
pre-1914
and
post
1914
practice.
actually,
during
both
periods,
corporations
with
their
officers
were
being
prosecuted
under
sherman
act
and
other
indictments.
of
course,
we
disagree
that
this
point
was
never
raised
in
the
early
days.
in
our
brief,
we
say
that
the
--
the
--
in
the
first
patterson
case
back
in
1893,
defendant's
claim
that
they
couldn't
be
prosecuted
in
a
representative
capacity
demurrer
and
it
was
rejected.
now,
i
want
to
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes
sir.
all
corporate
officers
who
have
been
prosecuted,
it
have
been
prosecuted
under
the
sherman
act
only.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no
it
was
not.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes,
let
me
--
let
me
try
this
illustration
and
i
suppose
that
if
you
had
some
corporate
officer
who
let
us
say,
authorized
a
--
or
merely
authorize
his
subordinate
to
go
out
and
increase
his
share
of
the
market,
telling
him
he
didn't
care
how
it's
done.
and
under
those
circumstances
if
the
support
to
use
methods
which
violated
the
act
to
--
to
get
that
bigger
share,
we
might
reach
the
authorizing
officer
under
section
14,
whereas
of
course,
we
couldn't
reach
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
we
could
reach
him
under
1
if
we
had
knowledge,
i
think
we
have
a
heavier
burden
with
respect
to
showing
knowledge
of
the
illegal
conduct
under
--
under
the
sherman
act
and
we
would
have
under
14.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
would
think
that
that
might
raise
constitutional
questions.
i
would
think
we
would
have
to
at
least
show
some
kind
of
--
of
knowledge
perhaps
that
a
violation
might
occur,
but
i
suppose
the
congress
i
think
really
probably
wasn't
able
to
do
what
it
tried
to
do.
it
was
clearly
trying
to
extend
this
liability.
i
think
the
situations
of
that
kind,
whether
or
not
it
can
be
done,
i
have
the
greatest
doubt
of
myself.
i
think
the
--
the
department
has
been
wise
to
confine
its
--
its
prosecuted
efforts
to
the
sherman
act
because
all
sorts
are
very
difficult
questions
would
and
do
arise
if
--
if
we
should
attempt
to
make
use
of
14
instead
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
think
in
many
cases
mr.
justice
they
would,
that
is
that
--
the
conduct
and
questions
would
be
covered
by
both
the
sherman
act
and
by
section
14,
however
insofar
as
we
are
concerned,
i
think
these
are
clearly
alternative
remedies
that
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
think
that
we're
entitled
to
--
to
proceed
as
we
have
been
under
the
sherman
act
because
we
do
have
a
more
severe
standard
of
proof
there
with
respect
to
the
degree
to
which
the
individual
is
implicated
in
the
violation,
i
think
co
--
congress
clearly
intended
that
where
the
officer
is
so
implicated,
he
should
be
subject
to
the
$50,000
fine
without
any
question.
14
does,
i
think,
describe
a
lesser
offense
which
has
never
--
the
limits
have
never
been
fully
tested
because
the
statute
hasn't
been
used
to
that.
i
might
add
that
none
of
us,
i
think,
at
this
point,
really
know
how
to
prosecute
a
corporation
under
the
sherman
act
simultaneously
with
the
officers
under
section
14.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
we
do
it
under
1,
yes.
when
we
charged
him
with
the
same
offense
and
under
the
same
statute
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
this
would
be
a
hybrid
procedure
to
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
these
are
both
--
these
are
both
--
these
--
misdemeanors
with
the
practical
problem
that
would
arise.
i
think
you
can
see
are
enormous
if
that
is
assuming
and
this
is
the
economical
way
to
do
it,
we
always
wish
to
prosecute
the
corporate
officers
with
the
corporation
rather
than
serial.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
under
the
sherman
act,
this
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
this
is
the
way
we've
always
proceeded,
i
say
if
--
if
now
we
should
adopt
a
new
procedure
under
which
we
try
to
indict
the
--
and
try
the
corporation
under
the
sherman
act.simultaneously,
with
a
trial
of
the
officers
under
section
14,
you
would
have,
in
my
judgment,
a
procedural
monstrosity
that
would
raise
all
sorts
of
problems
as
to
admission
of
evidence,
instruction
of
the
jury,
just
mere
pleading
that
haven't
yet
been
encountered
and
i
would
expect
that
--
that
if
we
switch
to
that
procedure,
our
corporate
officials
would
have
a
five
or
six
moratorium
and
a
year
of
moratorium
as
far
as
any
danger
of
conviction
is
concerned
until
those
procedural
questions
were
ironed
out.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
this
so
far
as
i
know
is
an
absolutely
unheard
of
--
form
of
--
a
procedure
to
prosecute
under
two
statutes
on
their
evidence
which
involves
all
of
the
defendants
in
the
same
time.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
we
had
charged
that
one,
i
might
--
i
would
like
to
read
what
the
--
the
indictment
says
a
little
more
than
--
than
he
read.what
we
have
charged
to
wise
with
is
--
is
this,
"that
he
has
been
actively
engaged
in
the
management
direction
that
control
of
the
affairs,
policy,
and
acts
of
national
and
hasn't
authorized
or
ordered
to
be
done
somewhere
all
of
the
acts
relies
in
the
count
of
this
indictment
to
have
been
done
by
national."
the
ordering
to
authorize
a
language
is
merely
a
description
of
course
of
how
any
corporate
official
manages
and
controls
the
conduct
of
a
corporation,
that's
the
only
way
he
can
do
it.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes,
the
sherman
act.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
not
at
all.
