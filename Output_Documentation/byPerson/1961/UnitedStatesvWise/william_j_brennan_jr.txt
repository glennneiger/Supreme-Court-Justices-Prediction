justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
wright,
is
what
you
just
said
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
affect
this
that
congress
wanted
to
make
it
easier
to
prosecute
corporate
officers
in
adopting
section
14,
but
in
fact
that
made
the
government's
job
more
difficult?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
--
i
know
but
the
point
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
point,
as
i
understand
it,
is
your
position
that
section
14
requires
at
least
an
allegation
in
the
finding
of
those
corporate
violations
before
there
can
be
a
conviction
of
the
corporate
officers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
that's
not
true
under
the
sherman
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore,
in
that
sense,
the
prosecution
of
the
14
isn't
more
difficult
for
the
government,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
the
government
--
and
yet
the
government
had
no
occasion
as
i
understand
it,
to
resort
to
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
that?
