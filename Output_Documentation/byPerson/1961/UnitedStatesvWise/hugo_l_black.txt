justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
you
would
still
have
to
prove
they
were
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
raised
is
to
how
far
congress
could
create
any
rebuttal
of
presumption.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
bother
you
if
i
ask
you
question
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
tell
me
if
i'm
--
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
understanding
of
your
view.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
was
no
section
14,
who
could
be
prosecuted
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
was
an
individual,
who
was
an
officer
of
the
company,
is
it
your
view
that
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
under
1?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
he
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
he
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
am
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
can
be
prosecuted
under
both.
suppose
it
is
authorized
and
they
prosecute
under
both
and
you're
wrong
about
that.
i'm
interested
in
what
your
argument
is
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
because
you
think
section
1
would
not
include
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose,
it
does
include
them
and
it
--
and
the
act
is
really
on
that
phase,
authorized
the
attorney
general
to
choose
which
one
he
will
prosecute
on
this
whether
it's
one
providing
for
$50,000
fine
or
$5000
fine.
what's
your
argument
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
you
what
--
what
--
if
we
construe
at
this
--
if
it's
construed
as
meaning
that
--
that
an
officer
can
be
prosecuted
under
either
number
1
or
14,
yet
one
of
them
provides
for
a
$5000
fine,
one
provides
it
for
$50,000,
what
is
the
--
if
--
if
the
defendant
has
any
judicial
remedy
there
or
any
remedy
of
any
kind
against
being
subjected
to
that
kind
of
decision
by
the
attorney
general,
what
is
your
remedy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
indictment
was
charged
--
charged
him
with
an
offense
in
the
exact
language
of
section
14.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
the
--
if
it
did
do
that
that
showed
on
its
face
that
it
was
under
14,
would
the
court
have
a
right
to
assume
that
he
could
fine
him
$50,000
instead
of
$5000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
getting
into
the
question
that
you
discussed
a
few
minutes
ago
thereon.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
would
want
--
should
be
against
the
law
on
there,
what
is
your
remedy
then
if
any?
with
reference
to
you
being
charged
in
the
language
of
the
statute
which
fixes
a
penalty
of
$5000
and
it's
insisted
that
--
by
the
government
that
you
should
really
charge
him
with
--
you
should
really
consider
that
he
can
be
fined
$50,000,
although
the
statute
whose
language
is
used
to
provide
for
only
$5000.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
do
with
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wasn't
raised?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
why
--
why
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
was
raised
there?
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
problem
was
not
raised?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
any
one
can
be
prosecuted
under
14
and
should
not
be
prosecuted
under
1?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
couldn't
reach
him
under
1?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
mean
that
under
14
you
can
convict
the
man
for
violating
the
sherman
act
without
proving
that
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
was
the
part
from
the
violation
of
that
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
been
unable
to
get
from
your
argument
and
from
the
other
argument,
yes.
why
these
do
not
allow
conviction
in
the
same
facts
to
prove
it
these
two
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
your
position
that
the
attorney
general
has
a
right
to
select
the
1
if
he
wants
to
--
that
gives
the
right
to
the
biggest
fine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
do
it
under
number
1,
do
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
something
like
the
tax
cases
that
we
had?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
be
gotten
by
a
felony
under
1
act
and
misdemeanor
under
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
is
this
one
under?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
number
1
only.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
point
is,
it
has
to
be
--
exactly
has
to
be
under
full
bags,
the
corporation
under
1?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
officers
under
14.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
see
yet
from
your
argument
that's
why
you
have
something
to
charge
case
under
number
1,
and
if
that's
the
case,
where
do
the
argument
come
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
description
is
it
not
of
your
--
your
allegation
that
he
violated
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
taking
--
for
taking
part
in
agreement
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
violate
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
would
the
fact
that
you
have
charged
this
that's
--
that
it
happens
to
be
a
language
that
could
be
used
and
then
charge
under
14,
affect
the
validity
of
your
indictment
here?
