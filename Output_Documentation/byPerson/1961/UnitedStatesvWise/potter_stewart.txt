justice

the
ninth
circuit
case
was
another
case
in
which
the
corporation
was
not
indicted,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course
14
is
applicable,

should
assume
only
if
our

justice

stewart
as
i
remember
the
theory
of
the
national
cash
register
case
which
as
you
remember
was
a
very
famous
case
out
--
in
part
of
the
country
and
state.
justice
potter
stewart
the
theory
was
there
that
these
individuals
were
guilty
of
using
the
corporation
to
further
their
own
personal
conspiracy,
wasn't
that
--
wasn't
that
the
theory
of
forfeiting
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
the
united
states
government
in
that
case,
in
the
indictment,
--

no
prosecutions
under

so
congress'
intent
was
certainly
not
realized,
was
it
in
fact?
justice

stewart
but
you
said

was
the
intent
of
congress
in
an
act
in
section
14
to
make
easy

easier.
justice
potter
stewart
and
one
never
utilized
by
the
government
except
in
that
one,
i
submit
a
case.
justice
potter
stewart
as
section
14
is
written,
the
jury
would
at
least
had
to
be
instructed
assuming
there
were
jury
that
until
they
could
not
find
the
individuals
guilty
and
--
and

and
until

unless
they
found
a
violation
by
the
corporation

justice
potter

--
won't
you
agree?

justice

perhaps
you
told
us
the
history
so
i
didn't
get
it.
justice
potter
stewart
without
going
into
great
detail,
the
sherman
act
was
on
the
books,
what,
from
1890
to
1914
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
24
years
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
the
clayton

was
enacted.
during
that
period,
did
anybody
--
did
any
officer
indicted
for
acts
done
in
a
representative
capacity
ever
raised
this
question?
