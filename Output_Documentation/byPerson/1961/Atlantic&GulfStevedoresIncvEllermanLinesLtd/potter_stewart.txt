justice
potter
stewart
was
in
that
respect,
this
was
similar
to
the
facts
from
the
waterman
case
where
the
cargo
had
been
loaded
in
the
philippines.
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
is
that
caused
the
bale
to
fall?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
strap
break?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you'd
--
and
the
stevedore
had
--
had
pulled
these
bales
by
the
strap,
putting
a
hook
through
the
strap
and
pulled
them
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
horizontally
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
the
hatch,
from
--
from
--
along
through
the
twin
decks.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
one
thing
that
--
to
drag
the
bales
horizontally
up
to
the
hatch
by
that
method,
but
i
should
think
to
then
unload
them
from
the
hatch
would
be
obvious
to
anybody
who
wasn't
an
expert.
it
would
be
much
safer
rather
than
just
hooking
him
through
that
steel
strapping,
the
advance
strap
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
rather
than
doing
that
to
put
it
in
a
--
to
put
it
in
a
sling
or
on
a
platform.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
the
only
place
they
do
it.
i
--
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
would
you
tell
us
again
that
--
how
and
why
the
jury
decided
the
case
against
the
shipowner?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
marshall
there
are
--
you
say
now
four
possible
grounds
of
negligence
upon
which
the
jury
could
hold
the
shipowner
liable.
first
was
the
manner
of
unloading
these
bales.
justice
potter
stewart
improper
stowage
of
india.
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
leading
to
what?
now
what
do
you
mean
by
improper
stowage
in
india?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
isn't
that
up
to
the
stevedore?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
why
is
it
if
he
--
if
he
starts
to
unload,
and
he
sees
that
it's
going
to
leave
a
great
big
mountain
of
bales
--
new
york
bales
and
they're
going
topple,
it's
up
to
him
to
flatten
those
out,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
true.
justice
potter
stewart
your
contract
didn't
say
that,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
said
that
you
were
to
unload
this
ship
in
a
--
in
a
workmanlike
and
safe
manner
and
part
of
that,
it
seems,
i
would
just
think
that
it
could
be
urged
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
part
of
that
job
would
be
to
see
to
it
that
the
other
cargo
was
left
in
a
safe
position?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
exactly.
that's
the
reason
i
don't
understand
your
point
two
on
negligence.
it's
necessarily
negligence
confined
to
the
shipowner
and
now,
what's
point
three?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
this
is
negligence?
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
it
negligence
if
he
refused
to
take
--
to
fail
to
take
the
cargo
off
the
vessel?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
sort
of
2
(a)
then
at
the
most,
isn't
it?
then
what's
a
--
what
is
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
several
weeks
or
months
earlier.
justice
potter
stewart
in
india
and
now
your
men,
the
stevedore's
men
were
down
there
working
with
those
bales
on
the
very
day
that
the
accident
happened.
