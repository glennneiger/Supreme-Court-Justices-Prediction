mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
if
the
members
of
the
court
please,
i
would
first
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
we
have
a
typographical
error
in
the
citation
of
a
case
about
the
--
just
below
the
middle
of
the
case
--
of
the
page,
we
cite
the
case
of
international
drug
versus
yankwich
and
we
say
that's
in
349
f.2d
and
of
course
there
is
not
yet
a
349
f.2d,
it
is
249.

thomas

your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
i
would
first
like
to
dispose,
if
i
may,
of
a
procedural
question
which
was
raised
in
a
reply
brief
served
upon
us
last
friday.
that
raises
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
proper
50
(b)
situation
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
first
say
on
this
point,
and
this
is,
i'm
addressing
myself
solely
to
the
procedural
point
now,
that
there
was
here
a
request
for,
what
we
call
in
pennsylvania
a
binding
instruction,
you
will
find
it
in
the
defendant's
requests
for
charge,
numbers
3
and
7.
we
specifically
asked
the
district
court
at
the
end
of
our
case
or
at
the
end
of
all
evidence
rather
to
direct
a
verdict
in
favor
of
ellerman
and
against
the
stevedoring
company,
the
third
party
defendant.
there
was
no
separate
paper
for
a
rule
50
(b)
motion
filed
and
if
under
cone
and
the
johnson
case,
we
must
file
a
separate
50
(b)
paper
then
the
point
is
correct.
the
point
raised
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
is
correct
because
there
was
no
50
(b)
as
a
separate
motion
paper
filed.
we
discussed
--
we
asked
judge
ganey
for
a
directed
verdict
in
writing
and
orally.
now
unfortunately,
since
this
point
was
never
raised
either
on
the
post-trial
motion
arguments
before
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
the
petitioner's
petition
for
rehearing
before
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
this
court
--
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court.
no
one
has
printed
specifically
that
portion
of
the
record,
in
third
circuit,
we
used
an
appendix
system,
no
one
printed
those
portions
of
the
record
where
that
was,
but
for
example,
at
page
1140
of
the
original
record,
the
statement
appears
by
myself,
if
the
defendant
is
liable
on
that
basis,
i
think
that
is
the
clearest
kind
of
a
case
for
an
award
of
indemnity
over,
and
that
is
in
the
discussions
among
counsel
immediately
preceding
the
charge
of
judge
ganey
to
the
jury.
again,
at
page
100
--
or
1113
of
the
original
record,
and
again
unfortunately
not
printed
for
this
court,
i
say,
“judge
ganey,
i
made
a
motion
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiff's
case
and
i
have
handed
it
a
written
motion
for
binding
instructions.
i
renew
the
request
but
i
am
also
21
years
old
plus
and
i
know
that
with
the
attitude
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i'm
wasting
my
breath.”
that
may
not
sound
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
i
said
i
--
with
the
attitude
of
the
court
of
appeals
toward
binding
instructions,
i'm
wasting
my
breath
and
the
judge
said,
“that's
quite
alright,”
let
the
record
show
it
is
denied
and
again,
i'm
still
addressing
myself
to
that
procedural
question
in
the
light
of
this
point
raised
in
the
reply
brief
filed
only
on
friday.
i
don't
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir,
they
add
up
to
this
that
there
was
a
written
request
for
a
directed
verdict
for
us,
we
in
pennsylvania
called
it
a
point
for
binding
instructions.
the
point
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
johnson
and
in
cone
versus
west
virginia
pulp
and
paper
seems
to
be
that
you
have
to
call
this
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
district
judge
so
that
he
will
know
what
you
want
and
he
will
have
an
opportunity
to
rule,
consider
and
pass
upon
it.
and
i'm
simply
pointing
out
to
this
court
that
that
was
done
in
this
case
and
that
there
was
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
made
in
this
case.
and
i
am
pointing
to
the
fact
that
before
the
district
court
on
the
post-trial
arguments,
it
was
said
in
the
written
briefs
that
this
was
the
--
a
50
(b)
motion.
so
that
i
think
sir
that
on
that
record,
we
may
not
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
that
i
don't
think
it
is
the
practice
in
pennsylvania
or
the
lawyers
from
pennsylvania
who
practice
before
the
federal
court
nor
is
it
the
practice
in
the
federal
court
sitting
in
pennsylvania
to
file
a
separate
paper
called
a
50
(b)
motion.
we
file
a
request
for
binding
instructions
and
we
file
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
--
after
a
verdict
has
been
entered
and
those
are
argued
and
this
was
clearly,
forcefully
argued
to
judge
ganey
on
the
post-trial
motions.
it
was
called
at
that
point,
a
point
preserved
under
rule
50
(b)
and
it
was
specifically
so
stated
in
the
briefs
and
not
controverted
by
the
petitioner
until
friday
of
last
week.
therefore,
the
court
of
appeals
as
we
say
was
really
exercising
the
judicial
function.
it
held
that
there
was
error
in
the
district
court
and
that
the
district
court
should
have
directed
a
verdict
in
favor
of
ellerman
and
against
atlantic
and
gulf
at
the
trial
stage
and
it
therefore
entered
that
verdict
following
appeal.
i
really
point
this
out
because
i
don't
want
this
case
to
go
off
on
this
procedural
point.
the
--
unfortunately,
we
did
not
have
a
chance
to
brief
it
because
it
was
not
raised,
but
that
is
the
posture
of
it
and
i
think
that
we
fall
outside
the
scope
of
the
cone
and
the
johnson
decisions
of
this
court.
and
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
case
as
it
comes
to
this
court
as
i
see
it
on
the
merits.
i
listened
rather
carefully
to
my
opponent's
argument
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
did
not
have
presented
the
case
in
the
posture
which
it
is
before
this
court.
when
the
court
looks
at
the
record
and
if
the
court
has
the
appendices
before
--
the
record
before
it,
you
will
see
the
type
of
operation
which
was
going
on
here.
there
are
photographs
taken
at
later
dates
of
hooks
and
bales.
the
stow,
and
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
that
this
was
all
tightly
stowed
cargo,
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
in
one
of
his
questions
earlier,
it
had
to
be
pulled
out
of
this
tight
stow
by
these
two
hooks
in
each
of
two
bands.
now,
there
were
four
bands,
a
minimum
of
four
bands
on
each
bale.
there
was
no
effort
made
by
the
stevedoring
company,
having
pulled
the
bale
out
of
its
tight
place
in
stow
and
dragged
it
and
drag
is
the
word
used
by
the
longshoreman
witnesses
at
page
25
(a)
of
this
record,
dragged
across
the
space
till
--
it
was
underneath
the
point
from
which
it
was
to
be
lifted.
there
was
no
effort
made
at
that
point
to
see
whether
damage
had
been
done
to
this
part
of
the
packaging.
there
was
no
effort
made
to
take
the
hook
out
from
under
the
two
straps
which
had
been
used
in
the
dragging
operation
and
put
them
under
the
two
hooks
which
had
not
been
subjective
to
that
strength.
it
was
after
all
that
had
taken
place
that
this
bale
being
hoisted
out
first
one
band
broke
and
the
second
weight
was
all
thrown
on
--
on
a
single
band,
it
then
broke
and
the
bale
fell.
it
struck
a
ledge
of
cargo
remaining
in
the
hole
and
i
think
that
part
is
clear
and
it
rebounded
and
struck
this
longshoreman
causing
him
injury.
now
in
the
charge
in
which
this
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
and
i
don't
think
it
matters
what
points
were
argued,
i
think
that
the
question
is
to
be
decided
depend
upon
what
evidence
is
in
the
record
and
what
issues
were
submitted
to
the
jury
by
the
charge
of
the
court.
the
court
first
submitted
an
issue
of
whether
this
was
--
the
ship
was
unseaworthy
as
to
cargo.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“we
don't
approve
or
we're
going
to
follow
the
first
--
second
circuit's
decision
in
another
case
and
not
extend
the
shipowner's
--
the
common
carriers
warranty
as
to
the
packaging
around
cargo.
we're
going
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
negligence.”
then
the
court
of
appeals
looked
to
what
issues
had
been
submitted
to
this
jury
for
jury
determination
by
the
charge
of
the
court
to
the
jury.
those
three
issues
are
--
they
are
--
appear
at
page
10
of
the
respondent's
brief
where
briefly
the
use
of
the
band
and
what
method
of
discharging
and
the
failure
of
the
ship's
mate
to
stop
that
method
of
discharging
and
a
so-called
safe
place
to
work
theory
having
to
do
with
permitting
cargo
to
remain
under
the
hatch
opening
which
cargo
formed
the
ledge
and
which
cargo
was
cargo
going
to
another
port.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
so-called
new
york
cargo.
now
at
that
point,
i
want
to
digress,
mr.
justice
stewart
in
particular
to
point
out
that
while
mr.
marshall
and
the
petitioner
here
make
a
great
thing
about
this
so-called
new
york
cargo
and
why
it
was
there,
there
is
not
a
scintilla
and
i
repeat
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
that
there
is
anything
improper
about
having
half
of
your
hatch
so
that
you
have
a
wider
demarcation
for
one
port
and
one
for
the
other,
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
that
this
should
have
been
taken
out
at
some
other
port.
there
is
not
any
evidence
and
therefore,
i
say
that
the
petitioner
can't
make
some
point
out
of
the
whole
quote
--
of
simple
argument.
if
you
look
at
the
authorities
aside
from
legal
authorities
on
the
way
you
should
stow
a
ship
to
preserve
its,
shall
i
say
overall
integrity
on
a
voyage,
you
don't
want
empty
compartments
next
to
full
compartments.
that's
why
you
have
ships
break
at
sea.
that's
why
you
--
that's
how
you
impose
structural
strain
on
a
vessel
which
was
not
designed
to
carry.
you
must,
when
you
are
going
to
sea,
divide
the
weight
which
you
are
carrying
and
no
one
witness
in
this
trial
said
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
court
looks
at
the
record
here
and
the
testimony
of
the
hatch
boss,
he
testified
that
this
split
stow
is,
it
is
not
along
the
waterfront,
is
frequently
encountered
and
in
a
common
carrier
vessel,
it
necessarily
must
be
frequently
encountered
and
no
one
criticized
that
but
the
lawyers.
now,
i
want
to
make
that
point.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
there's
no
such
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
there
is
no
such
evidence
and
then
let
me
explain
this
mr.
chief
justice.
you
see,
if
that
were
so
then
you
would
have
the
same
condition
in
reverse
when
you're
trying
to
take
it
out
in
new
york.
if
you
were
taking
for
example
a
cargo
from
one
end
and
leaving
in
new
york
as
you
would
necessarily
do.
what
was
submitted
to
this
jury
in
this
charge,
however,
was
whether
this
cargo
in
the
square
of
the
hatch
and
the
words
of
the
judge
submitting
it
were
should
have
been
shifted
or
put
out
of
the
way.
now
that
was
a
charge
--
in
the
charge
of
the
jury,
that
was
a
point
submitted
under
which
the
court
said
to
the
jury,
“you
may
find
the
shipowner
negligent
not
for
the
way
in
which
it
was
originally
stowed
there
but
for
not
shifting
it
or
putting
it
out
of
the
way.”
that
was
a
--
once
you
get
the
jury's
answer
to
the
unseaworthiness
question
and
focus
on
the
negligence
question
in
this
case,
you
find
that
there
were
three
varies
of
negligence
submitted
to
the
jury
by
the
trial
judge.
one
is
this
failure
to
put
out
of
the
way.
the
other
is
the
band
hook
method
of
operation.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
the
band
hook,
the
use
of
this
method
and
the
third
is
the
failure
of
the
mate,
the
ship's
officer
to
stop
the
work
which
was
being
performed
by
the
expert
stevedoring
company
which
we
are
engaged
to
do
the
work
and
i
think
when
you
get
to
the
guts
of
this
case,
that's
exactly
what
you're
going
to
find
that
there
are
three
theories
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
court
of
appeals
examining
the
charge
said
this,
“the
answer
to
the
--
or
of
the
jury
to
the
interrogatory
dealing
with
the
stevedore,
all
that
demonstrates
is
that
the
stevedore
did
not
create
the
condition.
now,
that
is
the
language
in
which
the
district
judge
submitted
the
d1
versus
d2
situation
to
the
jury.
did
anything
that
atlantic
and
gulf
do
create
the
situation?
they
ruled
out
or
that
language
ruled
out
the
whole
theory
of
this
court's
decision
in
crumady
versus
the
joachim
fisser
where
you
said
that
it
operated
upon
it
a
condition
preexisting
and
brought
it
into
play.
now,
that
was
specifically
called
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge
that
that
language
of
his
charge
ruled
that
out
but
we
--
all
we
have
is
an
exception
which
the
charge
was
not
corrected.
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
examining
the
issues
which
the
charge
submitted
to
the
jury
found
that
the
answer
of
the
jury
to
that
interrogatory
didn't
cover
the
whole
situation
because
it
only
covered
the
one
point.
it
then
examined
point-by-point
each
one
of
the
three
negligence
theories
of
plaintiff
versus
ellerman
and
it
found
that
as
to
each,
there
would
necessarily
have
to
be
an
indemnification.
in
other
words,
if
the
ellerman
--
i'm
sorry
if
atlantic
and
gulf's
method
of
working
was
wrong,
you
could
not
hold
ellerman
liable
to
the
plaintiff
without
at
the
same
time
as
a
matter
of
law,
graving
ellerman
indemnity
against
the
actor,
the
person
who
was
utilizing
the
unsafe
method.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir,
under
the
contract,
he
would
have
been
--
he
would
have
been
permitted
even
i
think
required
and
we
would
have
had
to
pay
him
extra
and
it
so
states
right
in
the
--
in
the
contract
and
the
judge
submitted
that
issue
to
the
jury
because
that's
one
of
the
points
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
was
ellerman
negligent
in
failing
to
shift
or
move
out
of
the
way.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
he
did
say
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
i
understood
mr.
marshall
to
say
the
same
thing
your
honor
and
i
think
he
is
quite
wrong
on
that
and
i
think
you
will
find
it
that
there
is
a
provision
in
this
contract.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir,
i
will
--
may
i
give
you
the
page
after
luncheon
because
it's
a
seven-page
contract
and
i
don't
know
where
that
is.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
no,
i
wouldn't
want
but
i
am
not
in
--
i
am
not
sir
saying
that
pennsylvania
law
controls.
i
am
not
so
arguing.
i
am
simply
saying
that
the
practice
under
rule
50
as
to
pennsylvania
courts
and
lawyers
is
that
you
file
a
written
request
for
a
binding
instruction
before
the
charge.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
and
then
if
the
verdict
goes
against
you,
you
file
a
motion
for
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
after
the
entry
of
judgment
within
the
ten
days
of
that
rule.
we
do
not
file
a
separate
paper
in
addition
to
those
that
we
call
a
50
(b)
motion.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
mr.
marshall
has
raised
this
judgment
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
a
reply
brief
and
i
am
--
what
i
am
trying
to
have
explain
to
this
court
is
that
the
procedure
we
adapted
is
a
compliance
with
rule
50
(b)
as
it
is
interpreted
in
philadelphia
and
in
the
third
circuit
and
that's
my
point
there.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir,
i
don't
think
the
state
cases
would
control.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
there
are
state
--
there
are
state
cases
there
are
--
it's
a
point
that's
never
been
raised
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
we
say
this
is
our
practice.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
i
say
we
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
i'm
also
saying
that
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
why
would
--
what
change
--
if
it
--
it's
not
raised?
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir,
if
it
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
what
it
did,
you've
got
to
raise
it.
it
can
be
considered
at
any
time.
i
concede
that
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
if
--
if
may,
i
shall.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
alright
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
you
see,
the
--
i
don't
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
cone
and
the
johnson
says
that
you
have
to
file
a
separate
paper
called
the
50
(b)
motion
because
you
wrote
both
of
those
decisions
if
i
recall
mr.
justice
black
and
in
both
of
them,
you
speak
of
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
or
a
judgment
n.o.v.
and
that
we
did
file
in
this
case.
and
that
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
we
do
that
in
our
request
for
charge
and
in
the
johnson
case,
you
point
out
in
a
footnote
that
that
is
the
pennsylvania
practice
and
if
the
federal
rules
seem
to
adapt
the
pennsylvania
practice
which
is
in
pennsylvania
is
by
statute,
but
i
will
file
a
memorandum
on
that
point.
i
do
want
to
discuss
the
evidence
in
this
case
because
i
think
it's
important
in
view
of
the
fact
that
petitioner
doesn't
just
ask
for
reversal
in
this
particular
case.
he
asks
that
this
court
state
a
new
rule
of
law.
he
does
it
under
the
guise
of
requesting
that
this
court
define
what
it
means
or
what
it
meant
in
the
weyerhaeuser
decision
when
it
used
the
term
something
about
conduct
sufficient
to
precluding
conduct
of
the
shipowners,
sufficient
to
preclude
indemnity.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
am
taking
it
as
the
former.
i
am
taking
it
as
a
reversal
and
a
direction
to
the
court
below
to
enter
judgment.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
i
would
have
to
come
within
50
(b).
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
oh
yes,
i
think
under
the
court
of
appeals
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes.
but
now,
i
say
that
the
direction
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
just
what
i
asked
them
to
do
and
what
i
asked
judge
ganey
to
do
and
that
entered
judgment
in
favor
of
ellerman
here
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
i
say
that
we
have
complied
with
rule
50
(b)
and
that
i
don't
think
that
that
rule
requires
when
you
have
filed
a
request
for
binding
instructions.
you
have
--
you
have
discussed,
argued
this
matter
to
the
judge
who
is
going
to
charge
that
jury.
and
thereafter,
you
filed
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
that
you
are
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
oh,
yes.
and
we
argued
this
to
the
district
judge,
mr.
justice
black.
that
i
think
was
the
point
of
the
--
the
reason
for
your
decisions
in
cone
and
johnson.
you
said
that
the
rule
contemplates
that
the
district
judge
shall
exercise
his
discretion
on
this
point
and
i
say
that
that
point
was
clear
--
was
fully
briefed
and
argued
to
judge
ganey.
now
denied
by
him,
surely
it
was
but
that
it
was
before
him,
surely
it
was
because
we
argued
it
and
mr.
marshall
argued
it,
so
that
the
reason
why
the
court
reached
the
results
it
did
in
cone
and
johnson
does
not
exist
in
this
case.
i
said
that
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
evidence
here.
here,
you
have
a
case
where,
and
it
is
perfectly
evident
from
the
examination
of
the
longshoremen
themselves,
that
this
stevedoring
company
did
not
instruct
its
men
in
the
proper
method
of
removing
cargo
such
as
this.
it
was
conceded
at
the
trial
that
if
you
used
the
same
strap
to
lift
the
bale
that
you
used
to
drag
it
out
that
you
were
increasing
the
risk
that
that
had
been
damaged
in
the
drag
out
operation
and
therefore
might
break
during
the
lifting
operation.
it
is
clear
uncontroverted
andn
mr.
marshall's
statement
of
the
contrary
notwithstanding,
that
you
have
somewhere
between
3%
and
5%
of
these
straps
will
break
during
this
operation
and
that
one
bale
in
50
will
fall
as
this
one
did.
now,
that's
clear
in
this
record.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
now
with
this
drag
out
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
may
i
first
answer
some
questions
before
recess,
mr.
justice
black,
you
asked
me
to
point
to
that
provision
in
the
contract,
if
you
will
turn
to
page
151
(a).
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
151
(a)
sir.
you
will
find
there
a
provision,
extra
labor
to
be
charged
for
an
actual
cost
plus
10%
and
so
forth.
now,
if
the
extra
work
was
required
to
be
performed,
i
say
that
the
stevedore
could
and
would
and
should
have
charged
ellerman
for
that
service
under
the
contract.
the
question
is
whether
it
shall
be
the
stevedore
who
shall
determine
what
is
necessary
to
be
done
to
do
this
work
properly,
or
whether
it
shall
be
the
shipowner.
there
has
been
much
mentioned
here
this
morning
of
the
function
of
mr.
quinn
who
was
the
vessels
officer,
a
mate
that
you
will
find
when
you
review
the
record
here,
that
quinn
disclaimed
expertise
as
a
stevedore.
he
had
never
done
the
work.
he
did
not
purport
to
be
an
expert
in
this
field.
he
is
an
expert
in
certain
fields
but
that
is
the
whole
division
of
labor
if
you
will
in
this
industry.
that
the
shipowner,
once
his
ship
arrives
in
port,
engages
an
expert
contractor
who
undertakes
to
do
all
of
the
work
required
in
connection
with
the
discharging
of
that
vessel,
and
of
course
this
court
has
said
to
do
it
properly.
now,
this
is
not
a
new
argument
because
in
our
brief,
we
point
out
the
fact.
and
this
court
can
verify
it
by
looking
at
the
original
record
in
the
case
of
joseph
versus
carter
and
weekes
stevedoring
company.
they
were
two
cases
back
about
1945.
they're
cited
in
the
brief,
in
which
the
stevedoring
industry
was
attempting
to
be
exculpated
from
a
locally
imposed
taxation.
the
same,
almost
identical
stevedoring
contracts
were
introduced
by
the
stevedoring
industry
there.
they
had
two
representatives
pioneering
for
the
industry
in
a
test
case
before
this
court.
and
they
there
argued
that
the
contract
very,
very
similar
to
the
one
before
the
court
in
this
case.
and
if
i
may
interpolate
something
there,
mr.
marshall
said
that
this
contract
was
prepared
by
the
shipowner.
that
is
not
my
understanding.
my
understanding
is
the
converse,
but
i
do
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
and
no
assumption
i
think
just
can
be
made
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
who
prepared
this
document.
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
this
court
heard
argument
from
the
stevedores
15
years
ago,
that
this
contract
which
they
undertook
placed
them
an
entire
charge
of
and
made
them
a
part
of
the
transportation
process,
and
that
this
was
their
job
to
do
the
entire
work.
and
that's
no
more
than
this
court
has
said
that
they
shall
do
and
do
properly
in
the
line
of
cases
commencing
with
ryan
and
the
last
one
of
which
is
the
waterman
case.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir
they
held
--
they
upheld
their
claim
that
they
were
engaged
in
commerce
and
were
therefore
exempt
from
the
locally
imposed
taxation.
the
state
--
the
city
of
new
york
was
not
permitted
to
tax
them.
and
that
was
their
argument
there
under
these
same
contracts.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
it
depends
upon
the
interpretation
of
this
contract.
in
other
words,
whether
they
do
actually
takeover,
perform
and
control
that
the
performance
of
the
unloading
operation,
or
whether
they
shall
be
under
the
direction
and
control
of
some
ships
officer.
they're
arguing
here,
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
ships
mate
should
direct
the
intimate
detailed
method
of
work
which
this
expert
stevedoring
company
shall
perform.
they
are
arguing
here,
for
example,
that
if
this
ledge
that
was
created
during
the
discharging
operation,
which
was
submitted
to
the
jury
as
to
whether
it
should
have
been
moved
out
of
the
way,
they
are
arguing
that
they
should
not
make
that
decision
that
some
ships
officer
who
is
not
an
expert
stevedore,
who
can't
possibly
oversee
the
work
going
on,
being
done
in
five
separate
holes
of
a
ship,
down
low
in
the
bowels
of
the
ship,
can't
possibly
see
all
this.
they
are
arguing
that
the
ship's
officer
owes
the
expert
stevedore
this
obligation,
to
tell
him
whether
he
should
use
a
hook,
or
whether
he
should
put
a
net,
or
a
cargo
trail
that
what
is
called
a
pallet
in
the
industry.
they
are
telling
--
they
are
arguing
that
this
is
a
duty
which
the
costumer
having
hired
the
expert
to
perform
the
job
must
direct
at
its
parallel.
and
we
say
that
this
court's
decisions
beginning
with
ryan
have
properly
interpreted
the
respective
duties
of
these
two
parties.
and
we
say
that
this
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
interpretation
of
these
contracts
of
the
industry
itself
urged
15
years
ago.
i
want
now
to
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
of
course
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir,
if
he
is
the
expert,
as
we
say
he
is,
it
is
his
obligation
to
determine
the
proper
method
of
doing
this
work.
now,
i
want
to
make
one
thing
clear
as
a
matter
of
practice
with
a
common
carrier
and
if
you
--
we
have
cited
certain
authoritative
works
in
the
field
outside
law
books.
you
do
not
load
properly
a
cargo
in
layers,
you
low
--
you
put
it
in
forward
section
after
section.
that
is
necessary
by
the
trade
in
which
the
common
carrier
is
engaged.
he
has
a
number
of
ports
of
call.
he
must
in
loading
his
ship.
he
cannot
load
everything
in
--
in
one
port
on
the
bottom
and
at
the
next
port
on
top
because
of
the
mere
factual
--
what
do
i
want
to
say,
the
--
the
facts
of
the
business
itself
because
you
cannot
say
if
you
are
loading
cargo
in
calcutta
first
for
example
and
then
you
were
going
to
proceed
westward
to
other
ports
that
you
are
then
going
to
discharge
that
cargo
in
a
particular
rotation.
you
may
have
to
discharge
the
cargo
loaded
at
the
second
port
before
you
discharge
cargo
loaded
at
the
first
port,
so
that
you
do
not
cover
it
up
as
a
matter
of
practice.
and
most
--
more
important,
no
one
has
said
so
but
the
lawyers
here
and
the
authorities
will
bear
out
what
i
have
just
said,
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
case
on
the
point.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
of
course.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir,
may
i
respectfully
point
out
that
this
court
had
said
so
that
there
is
substantial
authority
that
that
is
a
misstatement
of
a
historical
fact.
there
is
some
slight
reference
to
it
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
was
denied
in
number
284.
it
has
been
the
subject
of
study
since
this
court
based
its
seas
shipping
company
versus
sieracki
decision
upon
it
15
years
ago.
there
is
law
review
material
in
the
course
of
preparation
after
a
considerable
amount
of
history
research.
so
that,
while
this
court
had
said
so,
i
would
disagree
that
this
court
in
its
--
in
its
saying
of
history
has
reached
an
accurate
factual
conclusion,
i
don't
think
that's
the
question
of
law
at
all.
i
think
that's
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir
in
recorded
history,
there
are
some
few
instances
and
i
say
very
few
instances,
where
the
man
who
actually
sail
the
ships
load
or
unload
them.
now,
they
may
where
they
are
out,
let'
say,
well
a
data
in
--
two
years
before
the
mess.
one
instance,
he
was
out
on
the
california
coast
where
there
was
no
local
labor
around
but
there's
been
local
labor
doing
this
since
recorded
history.
we
--
in
this
--
if
the
court
cares
to
refer
to
that
now
discarded
petition
for
certiorari,
you'll
find
the
authorities
there
goes
back
to
rome,
there
were
stevedores
there.
and
the
members
of
the
crew
did
not
as
a
rule,
have
anything
to
do
with
cargo
operations
and
i
think
that
the
--
the
inconsistency
of
so
stating
is
demonstrated
by
the
references
that
this
court
has
made
to
the
--
as
i
recall
it,
use
the
well-known
propensities
of
seamen
when
it
extended
the
doctrine
of
maintenance
and
cure
in
standard
oil
company
versus
the
name
escapes
me
---
jones
and
waterman,
there
were
two
cases
jones
versus
waterman.
i
think
the
court
has
been
inconsistent
on
its
fact
statement
there
but
that's
not
a
part
of
our
case
sir.
as
a
practical
manner
in
the
navigation
of
a
ship,
you
could
not
for
example
that
judge
ganey
having
charge
this
jury
that
ellerman
could
been
--
could've
be
found
negligent
because
it
fail
to
put
this
so-called
new
york
cargo
out
of
the
way,
or
put
it
aside.
it
could
not
have
been
done
at
sea.
you
can't
imperil
your
entire
ship
i
suggest
by
taking
your
crew
from
its
job
of
navigation
to
handle
cargo.
you
can't
--
you
shouldn't
open
up
your
hatches
at
sea
because
then
you
run
the
risk
of
damage
to
cargo,
so
that
as
a
practical
matter
sir,
this
would
have
to
be
done
by
stevedore
import
or
not
done
at
all.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
we
haven't
talked
about
that
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
no.
no,
no,
no.
we're
not
talking
about
that.
we
are
talking
about
the
duties
inter
se
of
the
shipowner
and
the
contractor.
another
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
i
have
not
said
that
at
any
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
i
--
i've
not
said
that
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
now,
what
are
the
facts
of
your
hypothesis
that
this
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
oh
that
--
if
the
shipowner
was
entitled
to
indemnity
in
that
situation
sir,
it
would
have
to
be
as
against
the
loading
stevedore
who
did
it
so
improperly
that
that
would
happen.
but
there's
no
evidence
in
our
case
before
this
court
of
any
improper
loading.
everyone
conceives
that
this
cargo
of
bales.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
no,
i
didn't
so
understand
it
sir.
my
understanding
of
the
criticism
and
i
again
say
it's
only
lawyers
criticism
is
this,
if
this
rostrum
here
is
a
hold
of
the
ship,
the
front
part
was
loaded
with
cargo
for
new
york
and
the
after
part
with
cargo
for
philadelphia.
now,
you
are
necessarily
going
to
create
a
ledge
if
you
unload
one,
before
you
unload
the
other,
now
that's
perfectly
true.
but
this
is
the
way
in
which
a
ship
is
properly
loaded.
and
i'm
saying
to
this
court
that
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
that
method
of
what
is
known
as
a
split
hatch
is
improper,
per
se
dangerous,
or
that
there's
anything
else
wrong
with
it.
now
the
district
judge
did
submit
to
the
jury
a
question
of
whether
ellerman
was
negligent
in
failing
to
order
the
stevedore
to
move
out
of
the
way
the
bales
under
the
opening
which
formed
that
ledge.
now,
i
say,
in
our
position
i
would
say
it
probably
depends
upon
it.
i
say
sir,
that
if
that
was
a
dangerous
condition
which
was
gradually
developing
as
the
work
progressed
so
that
someone
should
have
done
something
about
it.
i
am
saying
that
it
is
the
stevedore
who
should
do
something
about
it
because
he
has
the
man
there,
he
has
the
equipment
and
he
is
the
expert.
the
ships
personnel
could
not,
as
a
practical
manner,
do
it
at
sea.
now,
i
think
where
the
stevedore's
argument
leaves
it
on
this
point
is
that
in
addition
to
employing
contractor
a,
atlantic
and
gulf
to
unload
this
cargo,
we
should
also
have
engaged
another
and
separate
independent
cargo
expert,
stevedoring
company
to
make
the
place
safe
for
atlantic
and
gulf
and
prevent
atlantic
and
gulf
from
creating
a
condition
which
was
unsafe,
which
unsafe
condition
did
not
exist
when
the
work
started.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes
i'm
familiar
with
it.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
weyerhaeuser.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
weyerhaeuser
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
that
--
that's
only
one
instance.
you
see,
the
stevedore
can
breach
a
duty
which
it
as
a
contractor
owes
to
its
costumer
in
more
ways
than
creating
an
unsafe
condition.
if,
for
example,
its
method
of
performance
brings
into
play
an
unsafe
condition
and
that
was
the
factual
situation
before
this
court
in
the
crumady
versus
fisser
case
in
which
i
believe
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
the
opinion.
and
there
used
the
phrase
that
the
stevedore
must
indemnify
the
shipowner,
in
other
words
has
breached
his
contract
with
the
shipowner
if
the
way
in
which
he
works
brings
an
unsafe
condition
into
play.
there
is
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
cited,
a
american
president
line
versus
--
it's
a
ninth
circuit
case
where
the
--
there
was
a
hatch
which
had
a
defective
--
i'm
sorry
a
hatch
beam
which
had
a
defective
lock
on
it.
the
defect
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
stevedore
by
the
ship's
officer.he
did
--
he
nevertheless
did
nothing
about
it.
and
during
the
course
of
the
unloading
operation,
somebody
bumped
the
beam
and
because
it
had
no
lock,
it
dropped
and
injured
someone.
now,
the
courts
always
have
said
that
where
you
so
perform
that
you
bring
into
play
a
dangerous
condition
of
which
you
as
an
expert
must
know
it's
dangerous.
now,
i
do
not
speak
of
the
latent
unsafe
condition,
a
latent
defect.
but
it
--
surely
if
anyone
should
recognized
what
is
unsafe,
so
far
as
a
discharging
operation
on
board
a
ship
is
concerned,
it
should
be
the
stevedore,
the
expert
in
this
business.
and
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
here
is
to
say,
“plaintiff
recovered
against
ellerman
upon
one
of
three
theories
because
that's
all
that
the
district
court
in
its
charged
submitted
to
the
jury.
and
upon
each
one
of
those
three
theories
if
ellerman
was
negligent,
then
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
constituted
a
breach
of
the
stevedore's
contract
and
the
stevedore
having
breached
it
should
indemnify
ellerman
for
the
damages
caused.
now,
true
it
is
that
in
the
district
court
level,
the
ellerman
of
unseaworthiness
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
ellerman
of
unseaworthiness
being
whether
or
not
the
package
which
this
--
this
banding
around
the
bales
should
or
should
not
have
broken.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“we
do
not
decide
this
case
on
the
basis,”
because
that
involves
an
extension
of
the
doctrine
of
seaworthiness
from
the
ship
to
someone's
cargo
and
you
are
then
imposing
liability
upon
shipowner
who
is
a
common
carrier
for
the
packaging
around
cargo
and
the
courts
and
the
doctrine
have
not
gone
that
far.
this
is
a
negligence
case
said
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
will
so
regard
it
that
if
it
is
a
negligence
case,
and
then
indemnity
follows
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
that's
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
done.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
not
if
you
assume
your
original
premise.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
that
it
was
negligence
to
load
it
this
way,
no.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
but
i
wish
to
point
out
sir,
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
is
improper
stowage,
that
it
is
wrong
stowage,
that
it
is
inherently,
dangerous
or
dangerous
to
any
degree
when
properly
handled.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
i
would
drive
that
point
home.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
if
you
assume
that
my
answer
is
effective.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
oh
if
we
negligently
loaded
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
but
i
say
that
you
can't
assume
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
because
there's
no
evidence
at
all
in
this
record
to
support
such
a
question.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
of
course.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir,
i
am
saying
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
is
improper.
now,
possibly
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
there's
no
evidence
on
that
point
at
all.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
that
it
is
solely
the
argument
of
lawyers,
says
that
“this
makes
it
more
dangerous.
this
is
improper.”
but
there
is
no
evidence
on
the
point
sir.
and
as
i
say
the
authorities
will
tell
you
if
you
look
at
them
why
it
is
the
proper
way
to
load
the
vessel.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
there
is
no
evidence.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
we
have
cited
such
books
as
the
department
of
commerce
has
a
text
on
loading
and
unloading
of
vessels.
i
forget
the
exact
title
of
it,
it's
cited
but
they
--
they
tell
you
this
is
the
way
to
load
a
ship
in
order
to
keep
your
ship
in
balance
during
a
sea
voyage,
avoid
having
particular
strains.
remember,
we're
talking
about
the
very
bow
compartment
of
a
vessel.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
which
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
you're
right.
i
would
not
be
so
arguing.
that's
right.
but
that
is
not
this
case.
in
conclusion,
i
--
i
wish
to
say
and
perhaps
my
argument
has
been
disjoined
but
the
ground
which
the
court
of
appeals
based
its
decision,
upon
which
it
based
its
decision,
is
that
there
can
be
indemnification
as
a
matter
of
law
where
the
facts
weren't.
and
that
the
jury
finding,
in
answer
to
an
interrogatory,
array
the
stevedore
in
this
case
was
erroneous
not
that
the
finding
was
erroneous
but
that
the
charge
of
the
court
was
erroneous
and
that
the
interpretation
of
this
contract
was
not
a
jury
question,
and
that
all
of
that
interrogatory
really
determined
was
that
atlantic
and
gulf
stevedore
had
not
created
this
condition.
we
never
so
contended
and
we
say
that
since
atlantic
and
gulf
was
the
actor
here,
then
necessarily,
if
anyone
was
negligent,
it
had
to
be
atlantic
&
gulf.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
sure.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
could
but
did
not.
that
was
--
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir,
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
charge
and
of
issues
which
were
submitted
to
the
jury
for
determination,
and
that
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury
for
determination
as
between
ellerman
and
the
stevedore.
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury
as
to
whether
that
could
have
consisted
of
negligence
of
ellerman
vis-à-vis
plaintiff
but
not
in
the
other
case.
the
other
case,
the
contract
case
is
between
d1
and
d2
was
submitted
only
on
the
question
of
whether
the
stevedore
created
the
condition.
have
i
answered
your
honors
question?
thank
you
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
byrne,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
