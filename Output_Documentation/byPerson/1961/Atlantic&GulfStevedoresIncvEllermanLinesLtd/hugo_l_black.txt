justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
ground
on
which
they've
said
it
was
clearly
erroneous?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
in
accordance
with
the
rule
for
the
common
law,
you
first
have
to
say
what
that
means
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
then
you
have
assumed,
would
tell
us
why
--
what
was
the
ground
on
which
the
court
said
its
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
shipowner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
had
baled
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
contract
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
i
don't
want
to
delay
you
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
do
you
accept
the
premise
that
a
finding
against
the
shipowner
of
unseaworthy
by
reason
of
defect
in
the
ways
of
work
and
so
forth,
would
justify
a
finding
in
favor
against
the
stevedore
on
the
ground
of
negligence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
unseaworthiness
only.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
the
rules
the
same
to
finding
liability
on
account
of
unseaworthiness
and
on
the
account
of
negligence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
evidence
to
show
that
they
could've
discovered
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
here
for
the
national
association
of
stevedores?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
substantial
change
in
the
contracts
of
employment
between
the
stevedores
and
the
shipowners
since
the
ryan
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
meant,
has
there
been
any
efforts,
that
case
was
based
on
an
implied
contractual
basis?
has
there
been
any
evidence
to
make
a
specific
contract
that
would
preclude
imposition
of
indemnity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
find
--
i
didn't
find
any
such
clause
in
this
particular
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
that
go
then?
why
would
that
change?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
raise
it
until
then
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
going
to
submit
a
brief
on
that
point
as
to
what
would
be
the
effects
and
why
you
say
if
the
johnson
case
and
the
other
cases
do
not
support
the
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
would
think
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
proceeded
as
i
recall
it
about
a
motion
specifically
setting
--
setting
out
the
specific
reasons
why
the
--
you
are
asking
for
directed
verdict.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
that's
what
he
asked.
are
you
asking
--
will
you
take
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
that
repre
--
what
you're
saying
now
and
(inaudible)
as
a
direction
to
enter
a
judgment
against
the
stevedore
or
as
simply
a
reversal
of
that
judgment
for
a
new
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
true,
you
would
have
to
come
within
50
(b),
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it's
not
true,
you
could
still
rest
on
the
fact
as
i
recall
it
that
you
were
entitled
a
new
trial
under
that
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
which
you
did
--
which
you
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
however
it's
done,
do
i
understand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
drag
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
51?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
i
wonder
how
far
your
argument
here.
i
don't
know
this.
suppose
the
ship
for
they
have
on
it
large
number
of
barrels,
such
a
condition
that
when
you
reach
down
to
get
one,
it's
liable
to
make
the
others
fall
on
in
that.
do
you
mean
that
the
ship
could
say
that
that's
the
stevedore's
work
and
we're
not
liable
even
though
he
gets
hurt
from
that
condition
which
had
been
on
the
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
so
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
even
then
--
even
that
was
the
duty
of
the
contractor
to
move
it
and
move
it
in
the
most
careful
manner
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
wouldn't
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
a
shipowner
could
escape
liability,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
that's
stevedoring.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
get
indemnity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
hypothesize
case
was
that
there's
some
barrel
there,
and
if
you
touch
one
of
them,
some
of
the
others
roll
over
and
hit
a
man
who
is
working
there
where
it
has
to
be
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
there
was
an
argument
which
may
or
may
not
have
a
validity
to
do
it.
you
mean
i
have
to
reach
it.
these
bales
were
loaded
in
such
a
way
that
if
you
unload
them
at
new
york
for
instance,
you're
more
liable
to
be
hurt
than
you
were
--
if
you
unload
them
in
philadelphia.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
leave
out
the
word
creating
that
would
be
alright,
wouldn't
it,
from
--
against
here.
stevedore
creating
it
--
are
you
familiar
with
our
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
one
several
years
ago
and
you
could
probably
remember
the
name
of
it.
as
stevedores
loaded
the
ship
at
new
york,
as
i
recall
it,
and
went
on
to
boston.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
find
just
how
far
your
statement
goes
and
see
what
is
the
difference
between
that.
are
you
saying
that
there's
no
evidence
of
any
kind
to
show
that
this
was
stowed
in
a
way,
which
made
it
more
dangerous
for
the
man
in
new
york
who
followed
the
ordinary
course
of
procedure
to
unload
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
improper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i'm
--
i'm
talk
--
you're
just
limiting
it
to
the
abstract
evidence
that
there's
no
evidence
to
show
that
that's
the
improper
way
to
load
it
or
that
there's
no
evidence
to
show
that
that
was
the
improper
way
to
load
it
under
the
circumstances
which
it
was
foreseeable
it
might
be
taken
out
by
stevedore.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
was
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
we
wouldn't
be
governed
by
authorities
on
that
but
we
have
to
go
to
its
evidence
that's
showed
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
people
familiar
with
this
--
i
understand
--
i
understand
that
argument,
but
i
don't
understand
why
we
did
it
from
authorities?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
there
were
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
experts,
so-called
expert
with
experience,
who
would
testify
to
what
you
said,
you
would
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
ask,
if
you
would
submit
to
us,
it
seems
to
me
a
direct
dispute
between
you
and
opposing
counsel
as
to
whether
there
was
evidence
on
which
a
jury
could
have
found
the
way
this
--
whether
the
stowage
took
place
resulted
in
a
foreseeable
name
into
a
stevedore
who
is
working
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
there
was
evidence
and
he
said
there's
none.
