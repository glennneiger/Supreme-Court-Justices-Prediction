whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please
sir?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
could
it
be

under
the
evidence
here
that
the
presence
of
the
new
york
bales
and
the
manner
of
unloading
of
the
philadelphia
bales
did
not
consist
of
any
breach
of
duty
or
failure
on
the
part
of
the
stevedore,
could
the
jury
find
in
these
circumstances
as
an
issue
of
fact
that
the
stevedore
was
not
guilty
of
any
improper
breach
or
could
--
method
could?
