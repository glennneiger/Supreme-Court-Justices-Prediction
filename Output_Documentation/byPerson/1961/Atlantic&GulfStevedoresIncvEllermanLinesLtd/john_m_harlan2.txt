justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
want
to
see
if
i
understand
your
argument.
what
you're
suggesting
as
i
get
it
is
that
the
jury
could
have
found
that
the
negligence
of
ellerman
and
steamship
company
consisted
in
permitting
this
loading
operation
to
go
on
in
the
face
of
this
new
york
cargo.
in
other
words,
that
even
though
there
was
no
negligence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
just
trying
to
see
whether
i
understand
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
your
point
of
view,
give
me
a
bit
of
time.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
the
negligence
that
was
the
basis
for
the
verdict
against
ellerman
consisted
not
on
using
this
particular
method
of
towing,
vertical
towing,
but
in
performing
the
unloading
operation
or
allowing
the
unloading
operation
to
be
performed
with
the
new
york
cargo
being
positioned
as
it
was,
and
that
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
--
against
ellerman
was
consistent
with
their
verdict
in
favor
of
your
client
on
the
theory
that
your
client
was
not
responsible
for
that
stowage,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
very
difficult
to
understand
if
the
negligence
that
was
found
by
the
jury
is
against
ellerman
consisted
in
the
use
of
this
method
of
hauling
the
cargo
out,
if
that
was
the
negligence,
it's
very
hard
to
see
how
they
could
have,
at
the
same
time,
exonerated
your
client.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
judge
kalodner
seems
to
think
that
the
jury
was
not
instructed
properly.
he
says
on
page
15
(a)
of
your
appendix
to
the
petition
of
certiorari,
he
says
that
it
must
have
been
--
it
must
here
be
noted
that
the
district
court
in
its
charge
to
the
jury
with
respect
to
the
indemnity
action,
they
failed
to
instruct
it,
that
if
atlantic
carried
on
the
discharge
of
the
philadelphia
bales
in
a
place
unsafe
to
work,
that
means
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
the
new
york
cargo,
i
suppose,
that
it
was
guilty
of
the
breach
of
warranty,
and
then
he
goes
on
and
says
the
district
court
urged
in
this
respect
into
its
error
may
be
attributed
to
the
fact
the
jury
in
its
answer
to
interrogatory
number
4,
put
it
to
atlantic
if
there's
any
failure.
now,
my
question
to
you
is,
was
such
a
request
put
by
your
adversary?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
that's
all
very
vague
and
ambiguous
now
from
the
jury
standpoint,
but
if
this
question
that
judge
kalodner
said,
should
have
been
put
to
the
jury
but
was
not
put
to
the
jury.
had
it
been
put
to
the
jury,
and
the
jury
has
brought
in
a
verdict
against
you,
would
you
be
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i'm
trying
to
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
that
the
respect
in
which
judge
kalodner
says
that
the
instructions
were
deficient,
do
they
or
do
not
--
this
was
the
failure
to
give
that
instruction,
represent
a
denial
of
the
request
for
such
an
instruction
or
is
it
simply
that
the
judge
himself
didn't
do
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
imagined.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
was
submitted
as
fully
as
your
adversary
wanted
it
submitted.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
weyerhaeuser
say
anything
contrary
to
that?
