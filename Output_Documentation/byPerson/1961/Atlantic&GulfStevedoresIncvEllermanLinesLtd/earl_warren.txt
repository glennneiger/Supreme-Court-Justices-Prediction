what
was
that
last
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
do
those
add
up
to
the
things
you've
just
read
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
--
in
the
evidence
to
indicate
that
while
it
might
have
been
a
proper
procedure
to
--
to
stow
this
new
york
and
philadelphia
this
--
new
york
and
philadelphia
cargoes
the
way
they
were
sort
in
--
in
india
having
in
mind
that
the
new
york
cargo
would
come
out
first
that
it
--
it
was
negligence
not
to
take
the
new
york
cargo
up
first
but
to
leave
this
overlap
and
--
and
--
and
create
a
hazard
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
--
in
taking
out
the
philadelphia
cargo.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr
byrne
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
--
can
you
tell
us
whether
under
the
contract,
the
stevedore
could
or
should
have
removed
enough
of
the
--
the
new
york
cargo
before
taking
the
philadelphia
cargo
out
so
as
to
have
removed
the
hazard
that
cause
this
injury
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
--
i
understood
mr.
marshall
to
say
that
under
the
contract
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
they'd
as
much
as
touched
this
new
york
cargo
and
anything
had
gone
wrong
that
they
would
have
been
absolutely
liable
for
--
for
any
injury.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
may
i
--
may
i
say
this
also
to
you
before
--
before
lunch.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
your
procedural
question,
you
--
you
discussed
somewhat
pennsylvania
cases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
--
would
you
mind
giving
us
a
little
memo
of
the
--
of
the
pennsylvania
cases
on
that
--
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
there
state
cases
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
there
favorable
cases
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
mr.
marshall
you
may
--
you
may
also
file
a
memo
on
it.
we
don't
need
a
full
briefing
but
if
you'll
point
out
to
us
the
cases
and
the
practice
that
you
rely
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
byrne,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
the
court
holding
those
two
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
depends
upon
this
section
which
you've
just
talked
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this
mr.
byrne?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
this
philadelphia
cargo
had
been
covered
by
the
new
york
cargo
in
the
--
in
the
hold.
and
under
this
contract,
who
would
have
determined
how
--
how
that
--
how
it
was
to
be
handled
in
order
to
unload
the
ship.
would
it
--
would
it
just
be
up
to
the
--
to
the
stevedore
to
do
whatever
was
necessary
and
--
and
accept
more
responsibility
for
it
or
would
it
be
the
responsibility
of
the
ship
to
tell
him
what
they
should
do
with
the
new
york
cargo?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
some
parts
of
the
world
the
--
the
sea
--
the
seaman
themselves
do
the
unloading,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well,
that
is
a
question
of
fact.
but
i
was
just
wondering
if
that
was
the
fact
that
in
many
places
throughout
the
world,
seaman
do
unload
the
ship
if
that
wouldn't
in
it
of
itself
make
them
also
experts
in
--
insofar
as
unloading
ships
are
concerned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
mr.
byrne,
in
this
--
in
this
case,
if
we
were
to
assume
that
the
shipowner
had
permitted
this
ship
negligently
to
be
stowed
in
the
way
that
it
--
that
it
was
stowed
in
this
--
in
this
case.
and
--
and
then
the
stevedore
unloaded
it
according
to
normal
standards
in
that
business
and
the
man
was
injured
as
--
as
this
man
was
injured
in
this
--
in
this
case.
would
there
be
any
indemnity
over
at
that
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
wasn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
wasn't
inferring.
i
was
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i'm
just
assuming,
i
was
just
assuming.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
could
be
--
you
could
be
liable
under
those
--
would
be
liable
under
those
circumstances.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
marshall.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
we
got
that
--
i
think
we
got
that
point
you're
arguing
before
your
time
is
considerably
up
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
marshall.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
mr.
byrne?
chief
justice
earl
warren
pardon
me,
you
may
if
you
wished
to
do
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
we
don't
want
a
brief.
if
you
just
--
if
you
just
give
us
the
authorities
you
rely
on
and
do
it
latter
quickly
so
we
won't
be
held
at
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
consideration
of
it,
that's
all
mr.
--
mr.
byrne.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
gentlemen.
