this
matter
involves
a
claim
by
longshoreman
against
a
shipping
company
for
injury
sustained
during
the
course
upon
loading
a
vessel
in
the
port
of
philadelphia
and
in
which,
the
shipowner
inflated
atlantic
and
gulf
stevedores
whom
i
represent
as
a
third-party
defendant
claiming
indemnity.
in
briefest
terms,
these
issues
were
tried
in
a
10-day
trial
before
jury
and
the
jury
found
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
the
injured
longshoreman,
against
the
shipowner
on
findings
of
unseaworthiness
and
also
on
findings
of
negligence
and
at
the
same
time,
in
answer
to
a
specific
interrogatory
found
that
the
stevedore
did
not
violate
the
terms
of
its
contractual
obligation
to
do
its
work
in
a
reasonably
safe,
proper
and
workmanlike
manner.
finding
in
the
amount
of
$100,000
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
judgment
by
the
lower
court
was
entered
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
against
the
shipowner
and
at
the
same
time,
judgment
with
respect
to
the
indemnity
action
was
entered
in
favor
of
the
stevedore.
the
shipowner
appealed
to
the
third
circuit
court
after
its
motions
for
judgment
n.o.v.
or
for
a
new
trial
had
been
denied
by
the
trial
judge.
and
the
third
circuit
court
in
an
opinion,
april
7,
1961,
affirmed
plaintiff's
judgment
against
the
shipowner,
but
as
to
the
indemnity
action
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
lower
trial
court
which
had
been
entered
upon
the
specific
findings
of
the
jury
that
the
shipowner's
fault
did
not
arise
out
of
any
failure
on
the
part
of
the
stevedore
to
perform
its
work
in
accordance
with
its
contractual
obligation.
the
third
circuit
court,
therefore,
reversed
the
judgment
and
in
its
opinion
in
three
separate
places,
holds
that
indemnity
as
a
matter
of
law
lies
against
the
stevedore.
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
on
behalf
of
atlantic
and
gulf
and
the
third
circuit
court
without
opinion
denied
that
petition.
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
to
this
honorable
court
and
this
court
on
october
16,
1961,
granted
the
stevedore's
petition
for
certiorari.
i
might
say
parenthetically
that
there
was
a
companion
petition
for
certiorari
filed
by
the
shipowner,
challenging
the
validity
of
the
circuit
court's
affirmance
of
the
judgment
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
on
the
same
day
that
this
honorable
court
granted
the
stevedore's
petition
for
certiorari,
it
denied
the
shipowner's
petition
for
certiorari.
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case,
before
your
honorable
court,
was
to
consider
three
basic
questions
and
the
subsidiary
questions
encompassed
therein.
the
first
question
was
whether
or
not
a
matter
tried
to
a
jury
under
a
full
and
complete
charge
by
the
trial
court
which
encompassed
all
the
issues
in
the
case
whether
or
not,
the
circuit
court
by
reversing
the
judgment
entered
upon
that
verdict
was
a
violation
of
the
second
sentence
of
the
seventh
amendment
which
states
in
positive
terms
and
no
fact
applied
by
a
jury
shall
be
otherwise
reexamined
by
any
court
of
the
united
states
except
in
accordance
with
the
common
law.
the
second
question
we
pose
for
consideration
by
this
honorable
court
is
whether
or
not
in
the
presence
of
a
contract,
and
i
might
say
that
in
this
case,
starting
on
page
147
(a),
your
honors
will
see
a
contract
which
consumes
seven
printed
pages
prepared
by
the
shipowner,
entered
into
by
the
parties,
a
contract
which
spells
out
the
intention
intended
by
those
parties,
whether
in
the
presence
of
such
a
contract,
and
in
the
presence
of
a
jury
finding,
after
a
10-day
trial,
after
a
full
submission
of
all
the
issues
by
the
trial
court
is
charged
to
the
jury,
whether
the
circuit
court
erred
in
reversing
the
judgment
entered
in
favor
of
the
stevedore
without
reference
to
the
contract
and
merely
on
the
holding
that
if
it
was
negligence
for
the
shipowner
and
if
the
jury
found
negligence
of
the
shipowner
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
court
was
bound
to
enter
judgment
for
the
shipowner
on
its
indemnity
action
against
the
stevedore.
the
third
question
we
pose
to
this
honorable
court
is
whether
or
not
under
this
same
circumstances,
a
court
may
do
what
the
third
circuit
court
has
done,
namely
to
set
aside
the
findings
of
a
jury
and
a
judgment
entered
thereon,
without
a
plain
showing
as
this
honorable
court
has
imposed
as
a
prerequisite
in
the
mcalister
case,
a
showing
that
the
jury
verdict
was
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
you
certainly
may.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
if
your
honor
please
very
briefly,
the
circuit
court
reviewed
all
the
evidence
and
it
had
before
the
question
of
the
shipowner
and
the
question
of
the
shipowner's
right
against
us,
reviewed
the
evidence
and
said,
“there
is
enough
evidence
here
to
hold
the
shipowner
on
negligence,”
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes.
he
then
said,
in
an
opinion
by
judge
kalodner,
“if
there
is
a
finding
by
the
jury
that
this
accident
was
caused
by
the
improper
stowage
on
this
vessel
then
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
ship
--
the
stevedore
should
have
stopped
its
operation,
and
should
not
have
proceeded
to
one
load”
and
this
was
not
a
question
for
the
jury.
this
is
a
question
which
as
a
matter
of
law
can
be
determined.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes,
i'd
like
to
now
set
forth
exactly
what
the
facts
are,
if
your
honors
please,
that
we
have
the
history
of
how
the
matter
gets
before
this
court.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
if
your
honors
please,
leighton
beard,
the
longshoreman
on
july
1,
1955,
was
working
in
the
hold
of
the
vessel.
the
job
at
hand
was
to
remove
bales
of
burlap
weighing
approximately
1000
to
1100
pounds.
these
bales
of
burlap
were
held
together
tightly
by
four
metal
bands
approximately
one
inch
in
width.
historically,
and
the
evidence
clearly
demonstrates
this,
the
means
by
which
these
bales
are
removed
is
to
take
a
winch
cable
to
which
there's
attached
to
large
ring
and
to
this
ring
are
six
long
ropes,
and
to
the
end
of
each
rope
is
what
looks
like
a
gigantic
fishing
hook
with
a
flattened
edge
and
the
procedure
by
which
cargo
this
time,
under
this
record,
clearly
shows
has
always
been
done
by
this
method
in
every
port
in
united
states
and
in
great
britain.
we
would
place,
our
longshoreman
would
place
two
bands
--
two
hooks,
under
two
bands
of
each
bale
and
we
would
raise
three
bales
at
a
time,
because
there
are
six
cables,
six
hooks,
two
bands
on
each
bale
being
used
as
the
lifting
device.
on
the
staple
day,
after
three
hours
of
operation,
one
of
these
drafts
rose
to
a
height
of
approximately
30
to
35
feet
at
which
point,
two
bands
on
one
bale
broke.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
this
was
baled
in
india,
if
your
honors
please.
it
was
a
consignment
from
india.
it
was
not
loaded
by
the
stevedore
involved
in
this
case
but
by
others
under
the
control
and
under
the
direction
of
the
ship
as
the
evidence,
chief
mate
quinn
shows.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes,
that
is
correct
that
the
cargo
in
waterman
had
been
loaded
in
the
philippines.
if
your
honor
please
in
this
case,
we
--
we
take
the
position
that
there
is
more
to
our
position
just
that
someone
else
loaded
this
cargo.
what
happened
was
that
once
this
bale
fell,
its
truck
cargo
that
was
consigned
to
the
port
of
new
york
because
when
this
vessel
came
to
philadelphia,
any
evidence
supports
this
and
shows
as
i
think
fairly
conclusively,
there
were
63
tons
of
these
bales
destined
for
new
york,
immediately
adjoining
100
tons
of
these
bales
destined
to
philadelphia,
stowed
to
an
equal
height.
and
after
the
three
hours
of
operation,
the
new
york
cargo
was
of
course
somewhat
higher.
the
evidence
will
show
two
tiers
higher
and
these
bales,
i
might
say,
are
two
feet,
by
three
feet,
by
four
feet,
so
that
when
this
bale
dropped,
the
evidence
indicates
that
it
was
going
up
in
a
perfectly
straight
vertical
lift
and
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
only
witness
who
actually
saw
the
bale
after
it
began
to
rise,
because
obviously
once
the
longshoreman
helped
bring
this
out
to
the
center
of
the
hatch
and
steady
the
load,
they
then
go
under
the
coaming
to
secure
themselves
from
a
possible
fall
of
any
type
of
cargo.
the
only
witness
who
saw
what
happened
once
this
bale
started
upward,
testified
on
page
22
(b)
of
this
record,
that
it
came
up
perfectly
straight,
didn't
hook
onto
anything,
didn't
bump
into
anything.
this
bale
then
struck
the
new
york
cargo
and
careened
off
a
distance
estimated
variably
up
to
12
to
25
feet.
and
mr.
leighton
beard,
following
instructions
given
to
him
by
his
employer
was
then
against
the
act
bulkhead,
that
this
was
his
day
and
this
bale
followed
him
right
to
that
place
and
crushed
it
against
the
wall
and
he
sustained
very
serious
injuries.
the
first
operation,
he
lost
the
leg
below
the
knee,
the
second
above
the
knee,
and
finally
at
the
hip
level
and
these
were
the
injuries
and
the
damages
that
were
claimed.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
your
honors
please
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
both
bands
on
the
one
bale
broke,
and
the
bale
therefore
fell,
catapulted
off
this
new
york
cargo,
careened
off
in
the
direction
of
leighton
beard
and
pinned
him
against
the
bulkhead.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
that
is
correct.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes
sir
and
may
i
say
sir,
on
that
point
that
five
stevedores
or
five
longshoremen
with
an
average
of
15
years
of
experience
and
five
experts
with
an
average
experience
of
35
years
as
seamen,
as
sea
captains,
as
longshoreman,
as
stevedoring
consultants,
as
safety
engineers
in
maritime
matters
all
testified
and
this
is
set
forth,
the
specific
page
references
to
their
testimony
is
briefly
set
forth
in
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
page
6
of
our
brief.
they
testified
that
this
is
the
only
possible
way
by
which
bales
weighing
1000
to
1100
pounds
can
be
withdrawn
from
the
tight
stow
that
imbalanced
these
bales
once
they
have
made
the
voyage
from
karachi,
from
india
over
the
rough
seas
and
there
was
testimony
that
five
or
six
men
he
could
not
pull
one
of
those
bales
out.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes,
if
your
honor
please.
and
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
the
plaintiff's
claim
on
the
issue
of
unseaworthiness
was,
and
there
was
expert
evidence
to
support
this
theory
by
the
way,
that
these
bands
for
the
purpose
of
this
unloading,
a
matter
which
was
known
by
chief
mate
quinn
and
the
vessel
and
this
company,
these
bands
became
part
of
the
ships
unloading
gear
because
there
was
no
other
way
ever
used
to
get
these
bales
out.
and
since
the
ship
knew
that
these
bales
would
have
to
be
lifted
out
and
pulled
from
tight
stow
by
means
of
these
bands
and
since
captain
arthur,
a
wit
--
an
expert
of
35
years
at
sea,
testified
that
this
is
the
only
way
it
could
have
been
done
since
chief
mate
quinn,
the
only
witness
who
testified
who
was
on
board
the
ship
on
behalf
of
the
steamship
company
testified
he
knew
this
was
going
to
be
the
way,
he
knew
no
other
way.
the
theory
was
therefore,
that
once
these
bands
broke
for
any
reason,
any
absence
of
any
evidence
that
they
were
rusted
that
they
were
worn,
that
they
were
--
had
been
badly
used
during
the
manu
--
during
the
banding
of
them
or
during
the
loading
of
them,
the
unseaworthiness
was
the
fact
that
the
bands
were
a
part
of
the
ship's
unloading
gear
and
broke.
now,
the
plaintiff's
theory
with
reference
to
negligence
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
if
your
honor
please,
the
case
is
before
your
honors
for
this
sole
question
of
whether
or
not
the
shipowner
under
the
facts
of
this
case
is
entitled
to
indemnity
as
a
matter
of
law
having
been
found
guilty
of
negligence
and
guilty
of
unseaworthiness
and
at
the
same
time,
a
jury
having
found
us
not
to
breach
our
contract
(voice
overlap)
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
he
did.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
also
in
negligence;
now
i
was
just
getting
to
outline
the
four
theories
that
the
plaintiff
advanced
against
the
shipowner
on
negligence.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
basic
theory
was
that
this
chief
mate
testified
that
though
he
had
been
on
vessels
unloaded
by
my
client
for
a
number
of
years.
two
hours
before
this
accident
and
there
had
never
been
any
complaint,
never
any
comment
about
it
before,
no
challenge
to
the
method,
five
stevedores
said,
the
only
method
they
ever
saw,
the
only
method
they
knew,
five
experts
said
the
same
thing
and
not
only
that
this
is
the
costumer
in
method,
but
it
was
the
safest
possible
method,
a
method
in
accordance
with
the
philadelphia
maritime
trade
association
regulations,
the
plaintiff
alleged
against
the
ship.
you
should
not
have
permitted
atlantic
and
gulf
to
unload
this
vessel
if
you,
mr.
quinn,
chief
mate
knew
that
this
method,
though
it
may
be
the
best,
though
it
was
proper,
though
it
was
reasonable,
though
it
was
workmanlike,
in
fact,
you
criticized
this
method
as
dangerous.
and
an
expert
testified
that
you
had
the
duty
and
the
power
to
stop
this
operation
and
if
in
fact
you
had
a
better
method,
he
talked
about
some
method
of
using
slings
as
they
load
them
in
india.
this
is
one
of
the
basis
upon
which
the
plaintiff
proceeded
on
negligence.
if
you,
quinn,
thought
this
was
dangerous,
you
are
the
chief
mate,
you
stood
there
and
watch
this
operation,
and
the
evidence
is
clear,
chief
mate
quinn
testified
in
a
deposition
before
trial
which
is
offered
in
evidence.
he
stood
there,
and
he
watched
them
work
and
two
hours
before
this
accident
it's
inconceivable
because
that
might
seem
to
some
of
us,
he
calls
the
port
manager,
the
man
in-charge
on
the
vessel
and
says,
“this
is
a
very
dangerous
method.
you
want
to
use
slings
like
they
used
in
india.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
if
your
honor
please,
at
page
39
of
our
brief,
we
have
quoted
the
substantial
part
of
the
indemnity
charge
and
for

this
is

in
detail,
this
entire
method,
if
your
honors
please
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes,
if
your
honor
please,
because
five
experts
so
testified,
five
stevedores
--
five
longshoremen
so
testified,
this
is
the
only
method
that
had
ever
been
used.
defendant's
own
expert,
the
shipowner's
own
expert
testified
that
the
latest
improvement
in
the
method
that
we
was
use
--
that
we
were
using
was
in
fact
the
improvement
that

himself
made

of
six
of
our
brief,
that
this
is
not
only
the
--
the
customary
method
but
this
is
the
safest
method
to
unload
this
kind
of
cargo.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
well,
if
your
honor
please,
mr.
byrne
on
behalf
of
the
shipowner
argued
that
for
a
10-day
trial
and
argued
that
very
completely
in
his
charge
to
--
in
his
summation
to
the
jury.
the
point
of
it
is,
we
had
never
heard
of
this
method
before,
no
one
else
had
in
this
entire
trial
except
chief
mate
quinn
and
he
said,
“this
is
how
they
do
it
in
india”.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
but
the
point
of
it,
if
your
honor
please,
these
are
1100
pound
bales.
these
cannot
be
pulled
together
like
300
pound
bales
of
wool
and
when
chief
mate
quinn
was
pinned
down,
he
was
really
talking
about
wool
bales
weighing
300
pounds.
because
you
--
even
if
you
got
this
out
to
the
square
of
the
hatch,
if
your
honor
please,
there
was
still
the
problem
of
moving
an
1100
pound
bale
on
to
slings
where
they're
lifted
and
the
testimony
in
this
case
on
that
point
was,
it
would
take
five
or
six
men
and
then
it
would
be
a
--
a
greater
hazard
to
them
than
this
method.
we
submit
sir
that
this
issue
was
fully
exhausted
in
a
trial
of
the
case,
in
arguments
to
the
jury,
and
that
the
jury
decided
the
case
in
our
favor.
now,
i
should
like
the
hasting
--
in
haste
to
suggest
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
well,
if
your
honors
please,
i
have
three
other
theories
that
the
plaintiff
advanced
against
the
shipowner
which
i
have
not
yet
mentioned
and
may
i
just
say
that
not
knowing
which
of
these
four
theories
the
jury
found
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
that
is
correct
sir
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
at
the
bottom
of
page
4
and
top
of
page
5.
the
issue
submitted
to
the
jury
was
these
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
of
our
brief
sir,
at
the
bottom
of
page
4,
after
this
entire
trial
and
may
i
say
sir
that
these
specific
interrogatories
were
framed
after
and
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
record,
something
like
42
pages
of
discussions,
consultations,
arguments,
before
the
judge
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
on
how
we
would
encompass
all
of
these
issues.
the
first
question
was,
was
unseaworthiness
of
the
defendant
a
substantial
factor
in
causing
injuries
to
the
plaintiff
and
the
jury
said,
“yes.”
the
second
question
was,
was
there
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner,
which
was
a
substantial
factor
in
causing
injuries
to
the
plaintiff
and
the
jury
again
said,
“yes.”
the
third
question
was,
in
what
amount
do
you
assess
damages?
the
answer
was
$100,000
and
now,
we
come
to
the
crucial
question
which
is
before
your
honor,
the
fourth
question
to
the
jury
was
this.
“if
you
have
answered
'yes'
to
questions
one
and
two,
did
the
fault
of
the
shipowner,
ellerman
lines
and
the
city
line
limited,
arise
out
of
any
failure
on
the
part
of
atlantic
and
gulf
to
do
its
work
in
accordance
with
its
contractual
obligations
and
the
jury
said,
“no.”
and
the
fifth
question
was,
if
you
have
answered
question
number
four
in
the
affirmative,
was
this
breach
of
contract
a
substantial
factor
in
causing
injuries
to
the
plaintiff,
and
obviously
having
question
--
answered
question
number
four
in
the
negative,
this
was
answered
in
the
negative.
and
it
was
on
those
specific
findings
of
the
jury,
that
judge
ganey,
now
a
circuit
judge
of
the
third
circuit,
entered
judgment
on
behalf
of
the
stevedore
in
this
case.
and
it
was
the
judgment
entered
upon
those
specific
findings
which
judge
kalodner
swept
aside
and
i
submit
so
erroneously,
because
there
were
three
other
grounds
of
negligence.
number
one,
that
since
the
shipowner
knew
in
fact
that
we
had
to
lift
these
bales
out,
and
since
in
fact
it
knew
that
it
had
cargo
to
go
to
new
york
and
cargo
to
go
to
philadelphia
and
that
the
ship
would
be
in
new
york
before
it
got
to
philadelphia,
it
should
not
have
stowed
the
new
york
cargo
in
such
a
manner
that
it
was
the
impediment
extending
out
into
the
square
of
the
hatch
so
that
when
we
operated
in
removing
philadelphia
cargo,
and
the
contract
specifically
says
philadelphia
cargo,
“no
evidence
would
be
at
any
right
to
touch
that
new
york
cargo.”
they
must
have
known
that
a
hazardous
condition
could
possibly
result.
this
was
strenuously
argued
by
mr.
browsky
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
this
was
a
condition
existed,
committed
preexisting
before
we
ever
entered
upon
that
vessel.
this
was
argued
fully
to
the
jury
that
they
should've
put
the
new
york
cargo
on
top,
if
in
fact
it
had
to
be
unloaded
first
or
the
philadelphia
cargo
on
top
if
in
fact
it
had
to
be
unloaded
first.
but
to
leave
us
with
the
situation
where
under
our
contract,
we're
obliged
to
go
aboard
that
vessel
and
unload
philadelphia
cargo,
we
were
doing
just
that
in
a
proper
workmanlike
manner.
and
may
i
say
sir
at
this
point
that
our
contract
specifically
said
that
we
shall
perform
our
obligations,
quote
“with
every
care
and
due
dispatch
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
shipowner.”
it
actually
goes
on
and
says
to
the
party
of
the
first
part
charges
and
so
forth,
i
said
--
i
substitute
the
word
shipowner
because
that's
untenable,
but
we
will
do
our
work
with
every
care
and
due
dispatch
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
shipowner.
now,
witness
this,
if
your
honors
please,
what
an
amazing
coincidence
it
was
that
chief
mate
quinn,
the
top
officer
on
board
that
vessel
chose
to
stand
there
and
watch
us
do
this
operation,
appreciating
the
situation,
the
fact
that
new
york
cargo
there,
and
that
it
is
now
two
tiers
higher
than
the
philadelphia
cargo,
he
had
the
duty
and
the
right
to
stop
under
expert
testimony
and
judge
kalodner
found
this,
the
jury
must
have
found
it,
as
one
possible
ground
of
negligence.
if
your
honor
please,
all
we
did
was
to
go
in
there
and
use
a
workmanlike,
a
safe,
a
customary
and
approved
method
and
in
the
course
of
doing
that,
this
accident
happened.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
if
your
honor
please,
the
jury
could
have
found
that
the
improper
stow
was
the
condition
in
this
case
just
as
the
fact
that
he
may
have
been
even
a
greater
expert
than
we
because
certainly
if
the
common
experience
in
the
united
states
is
that
this
is
the
best,
safest
possible
method
and
we're
using
it,
the
mere
fact
that
quinn
injects
himself
over
the
case
and
says,
“oh
i
think
this
is
dangerous,
it
might
have
been
done
differently
of
better,”
the
jury
might
have
picked
him
up
on
that
if
they
believe
that
he
said
this
at
all,
and
said
“okay
mr.
quinn,
you
know
a
better
method,
you're
in-charge,
you
have
a
higher
authority
than
the
shipowner
--
than
the
stevedore
under
the
evidence
of
this
case,”
they
did
it
in
the
safe,
reasonable
and
workmanlike
manner.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes
it
is
sir,
starting
at
page
147
(a)
and
may
i
say,
after
justice
black's
question,
the
only
other
question
relating
to
conduct
in
this
contract,
again
which
takes
up
seven
printed
pages
is,
that
if
we
damage
any
cargo,
we
have
top
pay
for
it.
no
indemnity
clause
and
we
submit
if
your
honor
please,
that
under
the
decisions
of
weyerhaeuser
where
the
district
--
the
district
court
directed
a
verdict
against
the
stevedore,
and
on
appeal,
this
court
with
unanimous
opinion
said,
“no,
you
can't
do
that.”
all
questions
relate
into
the
contract,
the
intention
of
the
parties
whether
or
not
the
contract
was
breached
are
issues
peculiarly
for
the
jury
and
this
court
in
weyerhaeuser
went
further
and
said
in
so
many
words,
even
if
there
is
a
breach
of
that
contract,
even
if
there
is
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
stevedore,
the
indemnity
right
exist
only
if
there
is
only
absent
conduct
--
and
this
is
a
quote,
“absent
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
which
would
preclude
recovery”
and
this
court
said
that
is
an
issue
for
the
jury
and,
if
your
honors
please,
the
latest
pronouncement
on
this
very
point
is
the
case
of
mcnamara
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
mcnamara
said,
“even
if
there's
negligence
on
the
stevedore,
even
if
it
maybe
a
breach
of
that
contract
with
the
shipowner
on
whether
indemnity
is
to
be
allowed,
there
may
be
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
which
bars
indemnity,”
and
that
is
an
issue
to
be
decided
for
the
jury.
we
have
said
in
our
briefs,
if
your
honors
please,
that
this
issue
has
caused
great
concern
and
great
confusion
among
the
courts
because
in
the
fourth
circuit,
in
the
case
of
(inaudible),
which
are
discussed
in
our
brief,
judges
are
trying
to
decide,
well
what
is
conduct,
the
absence
of
which
will
permit
indemnity.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes,
mr.
justice
my
basic
point
is
that
the
negligence
of
the
shipowner
had
been
committed,
and
was
existing
the
minute
new
york
stow
was
placed
adjoining
philadelphia
stow
in
india.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
you
had
a
condition
then
committed
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
--
which
if,
and
may
i
say
this,
i
argued
this
to
the
jury,
but
i
submit
sir,
that
if
in
fact
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
those
are
two
of
the
points
that
i
gave
sir.
that
is
the
one
issue,
the
other
is
the
improper
stowage
in
the
first
instance
and
though
i
--
i'd
like
to
assume
(voice
overlap)
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
but,
if
your
honor
please,
and
this
is
a
great
difficulty
once
you
start
disturbing
jury
verdicts.
there
were
two
other
bases.
number
one,
mr.
browsky
argued
very,
very
strongly
that
they
should
remove
this
new
york
cargo
when
the
ship
was
in
new
york
and
offering
no
explanation
as
to
why
they
didn't
--
this
created
the
negligent
condition
which
hurt
beard.
and
there
was
one
other
point,
if
your
honor
please,
we
and
the
other
shelters
had
no
opportunity
to
inspect
these
bands
down
in
the
hole
of
this
vessel,
but
the
same
chief
quinn,
who
stood
there
and
watched
this
unload,
stood
there
when
these
bales
were
on
the
port
pier
in
india
and
he
testified,
he
was,
“in
charge
of
the
loading”
and
that
he
“inspected
the
bales
in
a
general
way”
and
those
are
two
additional
factors
which
were
strongly
argued
by
mr.
browsky
to
this
jury.
he
had
the
opportunity
to
inspect
or
have
these
bands
inspected
while
they're
out
in
the
open
in
the
broad
daylight.
he
knew
they
were
going
to
be
used
for
unloading
and
it
was
negligence
on
his
part
to
inspect
only
in
a
general
way.
now,
i
will
close
by
this
comment,
if
your
honors
please,
there
having
been
four
separate
possible
findings
of
negligence,
four
separate
issues,
not
knowing
which
of
these,
we
say
that
the
court
below
erred
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
case
of
weyerhaeuser
where
there
the
lower
court
directed
the
verdict
against
the
--
or
in
favor
of
the
stevedore.
here,
he
--
i'm
sorry
--
judge
kalodner
directs
a
verdict
literally
over
against
us
by
picking
out
one
of
four
possible
grounds
in
saying,
if
it
was
negligence
for
the
shipowner,
it
was
negligence
for
the
stevedore
who
by
the
way
still
has
the
protection
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
first
was
the
improper
stowage
in
india.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
improper
stowage
in
india.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
knowing
that
we
would
be
unloading
philadelphia
bales
with
new
york
bales
extending
out
to
the
center
of
the
hatch
and
not
giving
us
a
level
operation.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
no,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
but,
if
your
honor
please,
there
was
evidence
--
there
was
no
evidence
offered
by
the
shipowner
that
we
owed
any
duty
with
respect
to
the
new
york
cargo.
and
the
only
evidence
on
this
record,
may
i
suggest
sir,
was
that
of
fred
nelson,
our
stevedore
(inaudible)
testified,
we
have
no
right
to
touch
anything
but
philadelphia
cargo,
and
witness
the
fact
sir,
if
these
were,
as
an
american
presidents
line
removing
a
bin
that
had
a
locking
device
broken,
or
in
ryan,
putting
the
chalk
where
it
belong,
or
in
a
crumady
changing
this
little
switch,
this
shipowner
who
confronts
us
with
his
vessel
with
63
tons
of
bales,
we
would
literally
have
to
undertake
outside
the
rights
and
duties
under
this
contract
the
removal
of
63
tons
of
new
york
cargo.
and
i
submit
sir
the
first
new
york
bale
we
touched,
if
it
hit
beard,
we
would
have
an
absolutely
indefensible
position
because
our
contract
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
we
can
only
touch
philadelphia.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes,
it
did
sir.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
but
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
if
your
honor
please,
we
submit
that
it
would
be
a
question
for
the
jury
as
to
whether
there
was
any
evidence
that
could
have
been
done
more
safely
than
we
were
(voice
overlap).
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
point
three,
if
your
honor
please,
is
the
failure
to
remove
the
new
york
cargo
when
the
vessel
had
previously
been
in
new
york.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
i
submit
sir,
it
was
argued
by
mr.
browsky.
it
was
defended
by
mr.
byrne.
these
were
issues
outside
my
case.
i
was
defending
the
indemnity
issue
that
was
submitted
to
the
court
in
its
charge,
and
i
submit
sir
that
this
maybe
one
of
the
grounds
that
a
jury
could
have
found
it
upon.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
because,
if
your
honor
please,
it
was
argued
by
mr.
browsky
had
this
new
york
cargo
been
removed,
the
unleveled
condition
wouldn't
have
been
there
which
caused
the
bale
to
precipitate
over
against
mr.
beard.
this
is
his
argument
against
the
shipowner,
submitted
to
the
jury
under
full
charge
by
the
court.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
and
then
the
third
one
if
your
honor
--
if
that's
2
(a)
the
third
one
is,
that
whereas
the
evidence
shows
we
had
no
opportunity
to
inspect
these
bands
in
tightened
hold,
the
ship
owner's
chief
mate
indirect
evidence,
i
can
give
your
honor
the
page
reference
if
you
wish,
testified
that
he
was
in-charge
of
the
loading
and
that
he
inspected
these
bales
in
a
general
way
and
the
jury
may
(voice
overlap).
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
this
is
when
the
ship
was
loaded
in
india.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
but
with
a
much
less
opportunity
to
inspect
the
bands
because
at
the
very
least,
at
least
half
of
the
band
is
not
exposed
to
view
because
it
is
in
tight
stow.
and
there
was
no
evidence
offered
by
the
shipowner
that
we
had
to
inspect
each
one
of
these
bands
as
they
came
out
because
this
could
not
be
done
and
unload
a
vessel
that
contained
several
thousand
bales.
and
the
evidence,
may
i
say
sir
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
no
sir.
and
i
challenge
sir
the
statement
that
this
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury
and
that
it
was
limited
to
the
bale
and
hook
method
because,
if
your
honors
please,
you'll
look
at
page
39
on
this
question
of
the
criterion,
the
court
did
not
say
the
criterion
and
it
is
the
hook
and
bale
method
as
judge
kalodner
did.
here
is
what
the
court
said,
“ellerman
steamship
company
says
to
you,
that
if
there
is
any
liability,
any
liability
which
we
owe
mr.
beard,
that
condition
was
created
by
atlantic
and
gulf
stevedores.
this
is
in
the
exact
middle
of
page
39.
that
is
your
criterion.
did
the
atlantic
and
gulf
stevedores
create
the
condition
which
made
ellerman
lines
and
the
city
lines
responsible
to
the
plaintiff
and
to
show
that
he
didn't
limit
this
just
to
the
hook
and
bale
method
he
says,
“there
again,”
as
he
had
said
earlier,
“you
have
to
run
the
whole
gamut
of
the
facts
in
the
case.
you
will
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
was
an
unreasonable
discharge
of
this
cargo,
an
unsafe
method
used
in
the
discharge
of
the
cargo”
and
this
i
think
is
crucial,
“did
they,”
the
stevedore,
“breached
that
contract
to
do
it
in
a
workmanlike
manner”
and
this
is
the
test,
if
your
honor
please,
submitted
to
the
jury,
“with
the
utmost
care.”
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
if
your
honors
please,
i
don't
rely
solely
on
that
one
portion
of
the
charge.
this
issue
was
more
fully
put
to
the
jury
than
this
one
quote.
obviously,
we
can't
quote
the
whole
charge.
i
would
ask
your
honor,
justice
harlan,
to
look
at
page
1
(a)
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
may
i
suggest
this
to
you
sir?
mr.
byrne,
during
all
of
these
discussions,
never
mentioned
the
new
york
cargo
on
which
just
--
judge
kalodner
hinges
his
whole
finding,
never
mentioned
new
york
cargo
and
if
you
will
look
at
the
points
for
charge
submitted
by
the
defendant
shipowner,
he
not
only
does
not
mention
unsafe
place
to
work,
he
does
not
mention
new
york
cargo.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
now,
if
in
fact
mr.
byrne
wanted
a
more
specific
charge,
he
could've
had
it
and
may
i
say
sir,
this
appears
at
182
(a).
now
listen
to
this
as
to
the
extent
to
which
the
court
instructed
the
jury.
ladies
and
gentlemen
this
is
mr.
byrne's
request,
and
this
is
during
--
after
the
charge
in
chief
and
during
these
30
some
pages
of
discussion
on
the
record
where
we
were
up
at
the
sidebar
trying
to
hammer
out
the
proper
points.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
182
(a)
starting
about
one-third
way
down
where
it
says
“to
the
jury.”
ladies
and
gentlemen,
if
you
find
in
the
plaintiff's
case,
mr.
beard,
against
the
shipping
companies
that
that
band
broke
by
virtue
of
the
negligent
conduct
of
a
longshoreman,
who
were
putting
it
together
and
pulling
it
out
of
stow
as
emphasized
by
justice
stewart
and
taking
it
up,
if
there
is
evidence
to
so
substantiate
that,
if
that
negligent
conduct
was
responsible
for
the
break
rather
than
unseaworthiness
of
the
band,
whether
or
not
the
negligent
conduct
of
the
longshoreman
resulted
in
the
breaking
of
the
band,
i
think
you
have
to
ask
yourself
that
on
both
sides
of
the
question.
and
i
won't
take
the
time,
but
the
next
two
pages,
mr.
byrne
asked
for
two
additional
specific
points
and
got
them
over
my
objection.
i
submit
to
you,
this
issue
was
fully
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
jury
having
found
in
our
favor
this
being
an
issue
peculiarly
to
be
found
by
jury
it
ought
to
stay.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes
sir
particularly
since
he
offered
no
evidence
against
us.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
if
your
honor
please,
i
view
this
as
one
where
it
is
perfectly
proper
and
sustainable
to
find
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
against
the
vessel
and
still
consistently
find
in
favor
of
the
stevedore.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
on
unseaworthiness
alone,
if
your
honor
please,
recognizing
that
this
case
was
tried
for
10
days
and
nearly
i'd
say
80%
of
the
testimony
dealt
with
those
bands,
experts,
we
had
metallurgist
in
the
case,
i
would
say
that
if
those
bands
broke
and
there
was
no
showing
that
we
could
or
should
have
found
any
defect
in
them,
i
would
say
that
a
finding
of
unseaworthiness
against
the
vessel
could
clearly
be
sustained
and
on
the
same
posture,
there
couldn't
possibly
be
any
finding
that
we
brought
that
into
play
or
created
the
condition.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
if
your
honor
please,
this
is
the
first
maritime
case
that
i've
tried
for
four
and
a
half
years.
i've
been
trying
to
figure
this
out,
but
i
view
it
as
this.
if
in
fact
an
unseaworthy
condition
is
created
by
the
ship
--
by
the
stevedore
as
in
ryan,
as
in
weyerhaeuser,
as
in
crumady
and
as
in
waterman,
then
clearly,
if
it
can
be
shown
and
if
the
fact
finder
as
in
all
of
those
cases
did
found
that
the
stevedore
created
or
caused
the
condition,
violated
the
contract
to
inspect
or
correct
as
in
ryan
where
they
would
have
done
all
of
the
stevedore's
work,
all
of
the
shipowner's
work
then
i
submit
sir
in
that
circumstance
caused
by
the
ship
--
the
stevedore,
the
unseaworthiness,
being
the
responsibility
to
ship,
indemnity
would
follow.
but
in
this
case,
no
one
ever
suggested
that
we
caused
the
unseaworthiness
of
these
bands
and
there
was
no
basis
for
showing
that
we
could
have
discovered
any
other
--
any
possibility
that
these
bands
were
effective.
may
i
say
one
thing
further
and
i'll
sit
down
(voice
overlap)
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
no
sir,
and
not
only
that
the
evidence
is
clear
and
again,
i
refer
you
to
the
bottom
of
page
6
because
there
are
great
numbers
of
page
references
but
they're
all
very
specific,
every
one
of
our
own
stevedores
and
every
one
of
our
experts
testified
they
had
never
seen
a
band
break
or
a
bale
fall
on
the
vertical
lift.
and
mr.
byrne
challenged
that
issue
but
i
submit,
if
your
honor
please,
at
page
22
(b),
this
was
on
a
vertical
lift
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
6,
i
have
documented
in
this
record
40
or
50
page
references
where
that
statement
is
supported
by
the
fact.
i
would
like
to
now
defer
to
mr.
mchugh,
the
counsel
for
amicus
curiae
of
the
national
association
of
stevedores
and
i
thank
you.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
if
your
honor
please,
i
have
five
more
minutes.
i
would
like
to
take
up
that
last
question.
mr.
byrne
just
said
the
jury
could
but
didn't.
the
specific
answer
in
your
honor's
question
is
that
when
the
jury
answered
the
question,
did
the
fault
of
ellerman
arise
out
of
any
failure
on
the
part
of
atlantic
and
gulf
to
do
its
work
in
accordance
for
its
contractual
obligation?
the
jury
said,
“no.”
and
mr.
byrne
by
his
answer
creates
the
impression
what
the
jury
found
against
us.
that
is
not
true.
the
jury
specifically
found
that
we
did
not
breach
our
contract.
now,
i
would
like
to
assert,
if
your
honors
please,
there
won't
be
any
misinterpretation
as
to
philadelphia
lawyers
in
their
practice.
in
the
first
place,
mr.
byrne
was
handed
a
copy
of
my
motion
to
dismiss
and
a
copy
of
my
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
which
specifically
set
forth
the
reasons
and
support
thereof.
and
if
your
honors
would
be
kind
enough
to
look
at
the
docket
entries.
at
page
3
(a),
there
is
entered
in
your
official
record,
third-party
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
and
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
file.
if
your
honors
would
be
kind
enough
to
look
at
page
186
(a),
mr.
borowsky,
attorney
for
the
plaintiff
says,
“your
honor,
may
i
have
exceptions
where
we
have
asked
for
a
directed
verdict?”
we're
in
the
federal
court.
rule
50
(b)
says,
“as
a
prerequisite
to
a
judgment
n.o.v.
you
must
file
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
setting
forth
specifically
the
reasons
therefore.”
and
for
a
very
good
reason,
this
calls
the
judge
--
the
trial
judge
to
attention
so
that
he
can
decide
whether
or
not
he
could
submit
the
issues
to
the
jury
and
still
reserve
judgment
on
a
formal
motion
for
judgment
and
it
will
be
filed
within
10
days.
we
follow
ended
here
to
that
practice.
mr.
byrne
tried
this
case
if
your
honors
please
with
no
reference
really
to
the
third-party
defendant.
all
that
he
has
said
here
is
there
was
no
evidence
that
we
did
anything
wrong,
there
was
no
evidence
that
we
did
this,
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
stow
was
improper.
this
has
already
been
decided.
mr.
byrne
filed
a
motion
for
judgment
n.o.v.
as
to
the
plaintiff's
case
and
it
was
considered
fully
and
lost.
the
circuit
court
affirmed
and
your
honorable
court
denied
certiorari.
now,
if
in
fact
there
was
evidence
on
which
the
jury
could
find
negligence
against
the
shipowner,
that's
already
foreclosed.
the
verdict's
been
paid,
as
it's
suggested
by
mr.
byrne
in
his
brief.
now,
so
there
won't
be
any
further
mis
--
misapprehension.
mr.
byrne
created
the
impression
that
we
sort
of
trapped
him
last
friday
with
a
replied
brief.
well
of
course
we
have
to
file
a
reply
brief,
if
your
honor
please,
when
mr.
byrne
submits
a
brief
to
your
honors
and
two-thirds
of
which
comes
under
this
heading
appropriate
motions
under
rule
50
(b)
having
been
made
to
the
res
--
by
the
respondent,
the
legal
questions
were
preserved.
we
submit
as
we
do
in
our
reply
brief,
this
court
may
very
well
--
not
even
considerable
as
two-thirds
of
this
brief,
and
we
had
a
further
reason
for
calling
this
to
the
court's
attention.
mr.
byrne
was
gracious
enough
to
stand
up
here
this
morning,
tell
your
honor
for
20
minutes
that
he
really
filed
a
point
for
binding
instructions
which
under
the
badge
case
in
the
third
circuit
decided
in
1960
says,
“you
cannot
file
a
point
for
binding
instructions,
mixed
up
with
a
lot
of
other
points
and
expect
the
court
to
treat
it
as
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
where
you
got
to
set
forth
the
specifics.”
now,
mr.
byrne
in
his
brief
told
your
honors
at
page
3,
the
respondent
here
complies
with
all
of
the
requirements
of
r
--
f.r.c.p.
50.
it
moved
for
a
directed
verdict
in
its
favor
upon
its
cause
of
action
for
indemnity
against
the
petitioner.
and
to
examine
to
the
legal
ques
--
examination
legal
question
does
preserved
is
not
arguably
a
violation
of
the
seventh
amendment.
if
your
honors
please,
he
raised
the
50
(b)
issue
and
not
us
and
in
aid
of
this
court,
we
called
it
to
your
honors
attention
because
i
think
you
would
want
to
call
to
your
attention.
and
may
i
say
further,
if
your
honor
please,
at
page
28
of
this
record
--
of
the
respondent's
brief,
he
says,
“the
petitioner
ignores
completely
the
fact
that
the
jury's
answer
in
interrogatory,
asking
the
jury
to
determine
whether
respondents
fall
to
rose
out
of
any
failure
on
the
part
of
atlantic
and
gulf”
was
predicated
upon
a
charge
which
instructed
to
the
jury
and
then
he
quotes
half
of
page
29,
“if
there
is
any
liability
which
respondent
owe
to
the
plaintiff,
that
condition
was
created
by
atlantic,
that
is
your
criteria.”
mr.
byrne
did
not
paraphrase
that
quote
by
saying
as
the
court
did,
ellerman
argues
to
you
that
if
there
was
any
liability,
he
submits
it
to
this
court
as
though
this
was
an
absolute
charge
by
the
judge
when
in
fact
all
he
did
was
to
quote
mr.
byrne's
contention.
i
say
if
your
honors
please,
this
issue
is
whether
or
not
a
court
and
a
jury
having
properly
decided
the
case
after
a
10-day
trial
under
a
full
charge,
whether
or
not
the
circuit
court
could
pick
one
of
three
possibilities,
one
of
three
possibilities
and
say
the
following.
and
i'm
now
quoting
for
--
from
the
court's
opinion
on
page
227.
now,
bear
in
mind,
there
were
four
issues
of
negligence.
the
court
said,
“if
it
was
negligence
on
ellerman's
part,
if
it
was
to
permit
beard
to
work
in
an
unsafe
place,
it
was
equally
negligent
for
atlantic
to
handle
the
cargo
in
charge
created
an
unsafe
place.”
now,
i
say
to
your
honors,
just
as
i
--
i
don't
know
which
of
the
four
grounds.i
say
to
this
court
--
this
honorable
court
that
judge
kalodner
has
no
right
to
select
one
of
four
grounds
and
say,
“if
it
was
this,
atlantic
isn't
--
is
obliged
to
pay
indemnity.”
suppose
it
was
one
of
the
other
grounds,
suppose
the
jury
decided
that
it
was
improper
(voice

--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
may
i
--
mr.
francis
e.
marshall
if
your
honor
please,
i
will
say
to
you
there
is
no
direct
evidence.
that
could
properly
be
inferred.
there
is
no
use
of
--
submitting
a
supplemental
brief.
i've
gone
over
this
record
to
find.
however,
this
was
argued
to
the
jury
and
this
was
charged
to
the
jury.
it
was
an
issue
presented.
there
is
no
specific
evidence.
but
again,
that
is
in
plaintiff's
case
against
the
shipowner
and
mr.
byrne
offered
no
evidence
to
show
we
were
at
law.
thank
you
very
much
sir.
