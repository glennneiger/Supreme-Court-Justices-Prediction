mr.
martin
j.
mchugh
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
national
association
of
stevedores
appears
as
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
to
present
an
issue
which
we
regard
as
important
and
which
is
not
otherwise
presented
here.
it's
the
issue
of
safety
insofar
as
it
constitutes
a
part
of
the
general
maritime
law
or
the
admiralty
law.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
the
association
in
its
participation
in
this
case
is
not
concerned
with
who
should
bear
the
loss
in
any
given
factual
situation
as
between
shipowner
and
stevedore.
it
is
concerned,
however,
with
a
rule
of
law
which
we
think
will
reduce
accidents
and
thus
reap
to
the
entire
shipping
industry,
shippers
and
stevedores
alike
an
economic
advantage.
now,
basically,
the
function
of
molding
or
creating
admiralty
law
is
the
concern
of
this
court.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
have
had
occasion
to
remark
recently
that
no
law
and
no
body
of
law
as
the
judge
made
at
its
origin
to
such
an
extent
as
it's
the
law
of
admiralty.
safety
is
an
essential
and
important
aspect
of
that
corpus
juris.
safety
will
prevent
accidents
and
we
submit
that
it
is
as
much
a
function
of
the
admiralty
law
and
indeed
all
law
to
prevent
the
happening
of
accidents
as
it
is
to
recompense
the
wrong.
this
court
noted
that
fact
i
believe
in
1946,
one
of
the
extended
to
longshoreman,
the
very
class
of
workers
with
which
we
are
engaged
here,
the
warranty
--
the
traditional
warranty
of
seaworthiness
theretofore
owing
only
to
seamen.
the
court
said
in
the
sieracki
against
sea
shipping
decision
that
the
maritime
service
imposes
severe
hazards
on
those
who
are
in
performance
services
--
perform
in
it.
mr.
martin
j.
mchugh
indeed
not
in
this
--
what
i'm
--
mr.
martin
j.
mchugh
exactly,
your
honor
but
i
believe
that
since
you
are
concerned
with
the
molding
and
creating
of
admiralty
law,
you
are
concerned
with
the
–
fashioning
it
in
a
way
which
will
prevent
accidents
and
that's
my
point.
i
think
that
there
has
been
misinterpretation
and
confusion
in
the
courts
below
and
particularly
in
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
insofar
as
the
rules
laid
down
in
ryan,
weyerhaeuser
in
particular
and
crumady
in
particular
are
concerned
in
the
field
of
maritime
indemnity.
what
has
happened
here,
i
do
believe,
is
that
the
courts
have
shaped
a
rule
which
holds
in
essence
that
no
matter
what
activity,
innocent
or
otherwise,
a
stevedore
has
with
a
defective
part
of
a
ship,
the
shipowner
will
be
entitled
to
indemnity.
now
this,
i
submit,
is
wrong
because
it
will
encourage
shipowners
to
the
--
continue
to
tender
for
loading
and
discharge
unsafe
equipment.
it
will
absolve
of
them
any
responsibility
for
the
gear
and
equipment
on
their
ships.
i
do
believe
that
an
equal
responsibility
should
be
shared
by
both
shipowner
and
stevedore
for
safety.
now,
congress
has
entered
this
field
by
a
1958
amendment
to
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
and
vested
in
the
department
of
labor
authority
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
in
the
longshore
industry
to
promote
health
and
safety.
but
this
doesn't
mean,
i
suggest,
that
the
court
should
abdicate
their
traditional
responsibility
to
promote
safety
too.
and
i
suggest
that
a
rule
which
grants
indemnity
where
a
stevedore
has
just
any
association,
innocent
or
otherwise,
with
a
defective
part
on
the
vessel,
a
defective
vessel,
a
defective
condition
on
a
vessel,
is
a
rule
which
increases
accidents.
it
absolves
the
shipowner
from
the
responsibility
for
safety.
we
suggest
that
the
confusion
which
has
grown
out
of
crumady
and
weyerhaeuser
in
particular
should
be
clarified
and
what
we
propose
is
a
rule
which
says
in
effect
that
indemnity
shall
be
granted.
in
all
cases
where
the
substantial
cause
of
the
accident
resulted
in
a
foreseeable
injury
arising
out
of
a
substandard
performance
by
the
stevedore.
in
an
area
of
activity
where
the
stevedore's
skill
and
competence
should
have
been
the
major
factor
in
preventing
it.
in
other
cases,
indemnity
should
be
denied.
we
say
that
such
a
restatement
or
re-clarification
of
the
rule
in
weyerhaeuser
and
crumady
will
place
equal
responsibility
on
shipowner
for
his
equipment
and
equal
responsibility
on
stevedore
for
his
activities.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
martin
j.
mchugh
no
indeed.
weyerhaeuser
i
believe
says
exactly
what
i
say.
i
say
that
weyerhaeuser
warned
shipowners
that
you
must
be
safe,
when
it
used
the
term,
you
will
be
entitled
to
indemnity,
absent
conduct
on
your
part
sufficient
to
preclude
it.
this
was
a
caveat
it
seems
to
me
that
unless
you
live
up
to
recognize
reasonable
standards
of
safety,
you
shall
be
denied
indemnity,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
lower
courts
in
some
instances
have
confused
this
and
i
think
have
confused
it
when
crumady
came
along.
crumady
said
that
where
a
stevedore
brings
into
play
an
unseaworthy
condition,
he
shall
be
liable
to
the
shipowner
for
indemnity,
but
it's
important
to
note
that
in
the
crumady
decision,
this
court
observed
that
the
primary
cause
of
the
accident
was
the
negligence
of
the
stevedore.
now
here
in
this
case,
the
court
below
apparently
paid
no
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
jury
found
this
stevedore
free
from
negligence,
the
shipowner
guilty
of
negligence
and
having
--
and
guilty
of
tendering
an
unseaworthy
ship.
mr.
martin
j.
mchugh
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
martin
j.
mchugh
yes
sir.
mr.
martin
j.
mchugh
i
believe
not
sir.
my
--
i
haven't
made
an
exact
study
of
this
but
so
far
as
we
can
determine,
there
has
been
no
substantial
change
in
the
form
of
contract.
now
frequently
of
course,
a
study
on
this
subject
would
be
difficult.
mr.
martin
j.
mchugh
to
a
very
limited
extent
and
the
effort
has
been
substantially
this,
that
where
the
party
sit
down
to
write
a
contract,
they
say
that
indemnity
shall
be
granted
in
these
circumstances
and
then
define
them,
and
then
they
continue
and
say,
“these
are
all
of
the
understandings
implied
or
expressed
between
the
parties,”
and
that
has
been
an
effort
i
believe
to
bypass
their
effect
of
claim.
mr.
martin
j.
mchugh
there
is
not
sir,
absolutely
not.
