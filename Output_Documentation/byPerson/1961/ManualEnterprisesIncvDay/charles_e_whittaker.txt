justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what's
the
alternative
to
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
assuming
that
the
material
is
obscene,
and
it's
presented
to
the
post
office
department,
they
must
either
take
it,
mail
it
or
reject
it,
but
if
it's
obscene
they
have
no
right
to
take
it,
isn't
that
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
that
it's
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
prohibit
the
post
office
department
from
transmitting
obscene
material
in
mails?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
when
material
that
is
obscene
is
presented,
they
must
reject
it.
what
else
then
can
they
do
but
give
you
a
hearing?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
dean
lockhart
of
university
of
minnesota?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
