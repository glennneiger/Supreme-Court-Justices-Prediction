mr.
doolittle,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
date
mr.
doolittle
of
the
mailing,
did
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
25th
of
march.
yes,
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doolittle,
but
in
this
case
there
was
the
plaintiff
not
only
admitted
that
he
took
pride
on
the
fact
that
this
was
beamed
toward
a
certain
class
of
deviates,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
having
--
having
done
that
all
it
was
necessary
to
show,
it
seemed
to
me
would
be
what
--
what
the
effect
was
on
that
class
of
deviates.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
a
--
that
experts'
testimony
would
probably
be
very
appropriate
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
mr.
doolitte
if
--
if
this
was
mailed
to
the
universe
--
to
some
university
medical
school
for
--
for
scientific
study
in
this
--
in
this
area,
there
would
be
no
right
to
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
there
would
be
no
right
in
--
and
the
postmaster
general
could
do
it
but
where
--
where
it's
admitted
that
this
is
beamed
toward
one
particular
group
of
--
of
deviates
that
it
does
come
within
your
rule,
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
--
didn't
the
publisher
also
write
a
letter
to
that
effect
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
admitting
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doolittle,
where
--
where
--
where
is
that
letter?
i
know
there
is
one
in
the
record
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
page
88.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
mr.
dietz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
proud
of
the
fact
that
this
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
--
proud
that
he
was
going
to
homosexuals.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
dietz.
have
you
conceded
or
was
it
conceded
in
the
--
in
this
case
that
these
magazines
were
beamed
toward
homosexuals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
--
do
you
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
record
will
not
support
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
may
i
ask,
are
you
quoting
from
the
record
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
no.
when
you
--
when
you
say
that
the
inspectors
had
seen
time
him
after
time
and
had
said
to
him,
this
is
homosexual,
that's
homosexual
and
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
he
finally
--
that
he
finally
made
this
statement,
that's
all
in
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
not
just
to
say
each
time,
but
they
were
there
though
and
that
they
--
they
said
to
him,
now,
this
is
homosexual
and
so
forth
and
kept
repeating
it
to
him
until
he
finally
came
to
this
--
this
state
of
mind
in
his
testimony
or
aren't
--
is
that
you
conclusion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
is
the
lynn,
l-y-n-n
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
the
writer
of
the
letter
on
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
dr.
womack.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
your
explanation
of
that
letter,
what
does
that
letter
indicate
to
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
suppose
to
be
a
photograph
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
for
what
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
yes,
but
for
what
kind
of
--
what
kind
of
viewer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think
this
letter
implies
any
such
thing
you
don't
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
this
letter
implies
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
this
is
to
go
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
even
the
homosexual.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
that
is
--
it
is
the
fact,
is
it
--
it
fairly
imports
that
does
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
that
in
--
is
something
of
a
concession
is
it
not
on
the
part
of
the
publisher
that
this
was
beamed
as
they
say
to
--
to
homosexuals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
part
of
the
letter
would
indicate
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that
it
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
principle
argument
is
mr.
dietz,
is
it
not
that
these
publishers
have
--
have
the
right
to
--
to
beam
to
the
homosexuals
of
the
country,
these
things
that
appeal
peculiarly
their
prurient
interest
and
that
if
we
do
not
do
that
--
if
we
do
not
permit
that,
we
are
denying
to
them
that
which
is
given
to
--
to
other
people
because
some
other
things
that
are
in
circulation
do
appeal
perhaps
to
--
to
the
sex
motives
of
--
of
those
people.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
will
figure
this
in
your
opening
argument
that
we
were
denying
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
we
were
denying
to
homosexuals
the
right
to
have
what's
comparable
with
other
people
to
pin
up,
pin
up
girls
and
--
and
you
said
that
if
we
did
that,
if
we
took
away
from
them
the
right
to
have
something
that
it
would
appeal
to
them
in
the
same
way
that
the
so
called
girlie
magazines
appeal
to
the
--
to
the
normal
persons
that
we
would
depriving
them
of
something
to
which
they
were
lawfully
entitled.
now,
that's
the
way
i
understood
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
did
use
that.
i
did
use
that
word,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
dietz,
is
the
question
of
prior
restraint
properly
before
us
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
raise
it
--
did
you
raise
it
in
the
administrative
procedure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
raise
it
in
the
court
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dietz
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i've
looked
over
the
magazine
again
and
the
reader's
digest
article
was
not
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well
mr.
dietz
i
think,
we
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
we
better
get
to
rest
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
sure
of
that.
