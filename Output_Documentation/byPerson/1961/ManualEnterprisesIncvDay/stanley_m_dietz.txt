mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
–
may
it
please
the
court?
the
first
argument,
which
i
would
set
forth
to
this
court,
i
would
divide
into
three
parts.
i
feel,
since
this
is
basically
a
question
of
obscenity,
i
feel
the
first
point
that
i
must
cover
is
strictly
factual.
you
have
four
magazines
before
the
court
and
just
a
question
of
looking
at
these
magazines
as
judges
to
see
whether
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
these
magazines
would
revoke
to
the
court's
definition,
as
laid
down
by
mr.
justice
brennan
for
the
court
in
its
opinion
in
roth
versus
united
states.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
this,
mr.
justice,
is
a
civil
case
based
upon
a
criminal
statute.
it
is
not
criminal
prosecution.
it
is
exclusion
from
the
mails
under
the
provisions
of
title
18
1461
saying,
“all
obscene
material
is
non-mailable.”
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
the
same
statute
continues
to
place
a
penalty
of
five
years
imprisonment
or
a
fine
upon
anyone
who
uses
the
mails
to
transit
of
obscene
material.
and
i
think
that
you
will
find
in
the
government's
briefs
some
argument
even
to
the
point
that
it
wou
--
it
would
be
even
a
crime
for
the
postman
to
carry
it,
according
to
their
interpretation
which
i
don't
agree
with
the
government's
brief,
but
looking
at
the
individual
exhibits,
i
have
gone
over
each
one,
each
page
as
indicated
in
the
record
from
the
testimony
given
by
the
government's
doctors
and
i
have
covered
it
very
fully
in
my
brief.
the
first
exhibit
manual,
april
1960
issue,
the
psychiatrist
for
the
government
testified
as
to
16
bad
pages
out
of
possibly
48,
one-third
of
the
total
context
in
the
second
exhibit,
six
out
of
48
pages
were
covered,
in
the
third,
five
out
of
48
and
in
the
last
exhibit
only
four
out
of
48.
now,
in
the
government's
brief,
they
have
outlined
nearly
something
that
they
feel
is
wrong
or
revolting
to
the
statute
of
--
in
nearly
every
page.
i
cannot
go
along
with
this.
i
say
that
if
this
was
so
then
this
was
something
that
psychiatrist
should
have
testified
to
and
not
the
government's
brief.
this
brings
us
to
a
question
of
just
what
is
meant
by
this
court
in
its
definition
in
the
roth
case.
the
post
office
has
picked
it
up.
as
i
understand
it,
the
definition
says
that
as
to
the
average
person,
applying
contemporary
community
standards,
the
dominant
theme
of
the
material
considered
as
a
whole
must
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
and
the
government
would
argue
that
it's
not
to
the
average
person.
i
think
they
argue
even
further
to
this
court
that
this
court
did
not,
in
its
opinion,
intend
to
mean
that
obscenity
must
be
judged
on
its
effect
upon
the
average
person
but
only
upon
the
average
reader
that
is
expected
to
receive
or
be
the
recipient
of
this
material.
in
the
post
office,
they
have
changed
this
definition
or
this
test
of
obscenity
that
this
court
has
laid
down
to
one
in
which
material
is
obscene
if
it
would
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
a
homosexual
because
they
contain
this
material
is
deemed
act
homosexuals
and
only
produced
for
homosexuals.
of
course
this
is
one
point
that
i
would
gladly
argue.
we
contend
these
magazines,
if
you
examine
them
and
see
by
volume,
if
nothing
more
the
context
is
not
for
homosexuals,
but
is
basically
for
the
body
builder,
the
person
who
is
interested
in
large
muscles
and
you
may
view
each
and
every
photograph
in
the
magazine.
but
this
brings
us
to
the
second
consideration,
just
what
is
this
so-called
homosexual
audience?
what
are
they
composed
of?
i
argue
in
my
brief
and
to
this
court
that
this
is
the
word
itself,
homosexual
is
incorrectly
used,
homosexual,
the
word,
the
term.
this
does
not
describe
people.
this
is
a
term
that
describes
things
that
people
do
and
therefore,
the
way
that
it's
used
by
the
post
office,
itself,
makes
a
definition
inherently
vague
and
indefinite.
i
would
continue
with
comparison
of
the
definition
as
used
in
the
post
office
with
the
definition
as
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
roth
case.
now,
in
the
roth
case,
this
court
has
said
that
we
must
apply
contemporary
community
standards
in
judging
material
that
is
supposedly
obscene.
now,
that
--
that
is
a
catch
phrase
to
me,
contemporary
community
standards
because
the
post
office
would
say
that
this
material
is
headed
from
homosexuals.
well,
who
is
there
to
testify
as
to
the
average
audience
that's
homosexual,
then
what
is
the
community
standards
for
homosexuals?
do
they
have
any
community
standards?
are
we
going
to
allow
these
second
class
citizens
to
receive
any
literature?
this
is
a
point.
the
post
office
will
have
this
divide
americans
into
normal
people,
so-called
normal
people,
even
though
their
doctor
says,
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
normal
person
just
within
normal
limits,
normal
people
or
abnormal
people.
now,
for
normal
people,
you
receive
one
type
of
literature
and
that's
the
only
thing
that's
allowed
to
be
carried
through
the
mails,
and
anything
that
does
not
fall
into
this
category,
anything
that's
going
to
appeal
to
this
so-called
abnormal
people
is
obscene.
i
say,
this
is
censorship.
i
would
go
further
with
this
argument.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
perhaps,
i
did
not
make
my
argument
clear,
mr.
chief
justice.
my
point
was
this.
if
we
take
our
definition
as
laid
down
in
the
roth
case,
judging
the
material
as
a
whole
applying
contemporary
community
standards,
the
dominant
theme
upon
the
average
person,
the
effect
upon
the
average
person,
alright?
the
post
office
change
at
around
say,
it's
not
the
average
person,
it's
not
the
average
normal
person,
it's
a
homosexual,
alright?
now,
can
we
find
a
so-called
average
homosexual?
the
answer
is
no
and
this
is
in
the
record
from
the
government
doctor's
own
testimony.
so
therefore,
you
might
have
to
say
that
anything
that
is
going
to
appeal
to
a
homosexual,
by
the
definition
given
out
from
the
post
office,
has
got
to
be
obscene.
there's
no
--
there's
no
out.
have
i
been
able
to
make
it
any
clearer?
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
would
best
attempt
to
answer
that
question
by
saying
that
in
the
opinion
of
this
counsel,
there
is
no
community
that
has
no
homosexuals.
that
every
community
has
and
possibly
they're
not,
i've
--
and
i
stated
in
my
brief,
possibly
it
hasn't
been
--
maybe
they
haven't
been
discovered
if
you
want
to
use
that
term,
discovered
because
we
keep
these
people
suppressed
so
maybe
they
have
been
(inaudible)
it
out
and
brought
to
the
light.
now,
if
you're
going
to
--
the
only
other
way
that
i
could
answer
would
be
in
the
testimony
given
by
the
government's
doctor
in
this
case
as
to
all
of
the
different,
myriads
of
different
things
that
would
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
different
phases
or
types
of
people
that
he
would
classify
as
homosexuals
and
i
would
say
that's
impossible
by
his
own
testimony
to
set
any
standard.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i'm
having
a
little
difficulty
understanding
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
do
you
mean
by
that
question
that
there's
no
--?
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
that
was
not
what
i
have
intended
to
say,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
understand
the
question
now
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
hadn't
--
i
hadn't
really
reasoned
it
that
far.
my
reasoning
had
stopped
at
the
point
where
you
say
there's
one
group
of
deviants
but
within
this
particular
group
there
is
by
the
testimony
of
the
government's
own
doctor,
there
were
so
many
different
segments
that
there
is
no
person,
no
one
or
no
group
of
persons,
even
professor
kinsey
and
his
group
cannot
say
what
is
going
to
be
the
stimulant
to
or
what
would
be
the
standards
for
arousal
of
the
average
of
that
group,
that's
where
i
stopped.
you
went
a
little
bit
further.
let
--
let's
accept
for
a
second
just
for
argument,
let's
accept
the
government's
view
then
i
have
to
ask
the
court
to
again
go
back
to
the
exhibits
and
examine
them
carefully,
in
conjunction
with
the
record.
these
photographs
contained,
if
they
were
intended
for
homosexuals
and
i
argued
this
in
my
brief
that
these
photographs,
none
of
which
shows
the
completely
exposed
genital
area.
in
all
of
these
photographs
the
genitalia
is
draped
or
covered
and
these
photographs
are
not
worst
then,
what
we
so-call
normal
people
called
pin-up
photographs,
which,
i
think,
even
this
court
would
take
judicial
knowledge,
as
generally
commonly
accepted.
you
see
photographs
of
such
beauty,
female
beauties
as
marilyn
monroe
nude
on
calendars,
on
walls
all
over
the
country.
now,
my
argument
to
this
court,
if
you're
going
to
consider
that
these
photographs
were
headed
for
homosexuals,
to
appeal
to
homosexuals
then
an
analysis
of
these
photographs
would
show
that
these
photographs
are
no
more
than
the
photographs
comparable
pin-up
photographs
of
marilyn
monroe
and
the
other
beauties.
and
my
point,
in
that
argument
being
this,
if
we
so-called
normal
people,
according
to
our
law,
are
entitled
to
have
our
pin-ups
then
why
shouldn't
the
second
class
citizens,
the
homosexual
group,
if
you
use
that
term,
why
shouldn't
they
be
allowed
to
have
their
pin-up?
their
pin-up
is
certainly
no
worse
and
you
--
you
have
to
examine
each
one
of
these
photographs,
their
pin-up
is
no
worse
than
our
pin-ups.
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
three
parts
of
my
first
argument,
first
--
first
point
i
raised
in
my
brief.
the
second
point
raised
in
the
brief
is
this
question
following
this
court's
decision
in
smith
versus
california,
a
question
whether
a
publisher
of
a
magazine
or
any
sort
of
literature
is
held
accountable
for
the
actions
of
his
contributing
photographers.
these
magazines
were
held
to
be
non-mailable
on
two
parts.
one
is
that
they
were
obscene
and
two
is
that
they
were
non-mailable
because
they
gave
information,
supposedly
where,
how,
from
whom
obscene
material
may
be
obtained.
my
point
is,
and
the
record,
i
think,
shows
that
the
publisher
of
this
magazine
did
everything
reasonable
to
learn,
to
ascertain
for
himself
just
what
materials,
the
contributing
photographers
were
selling
and
that
he
--
and
the
record
also
indicates
that
he
voluntarily
deleted
from
his
magazines
the
advertisements
of
particular
photographers
whom
he
considered,
in
his
opinion,
were
selling
non-mailable
photographs.
the
record
will
also
show
that
he,
himself,
did
not
advertise
any
of
his
own
particular
completely
nude
photographs,
which
he
was
selling
under
his
own
trade
name
of
continental
artist.
while
i'm
at
that
point,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
something
in
the
government's
brief
which
i
feel
should
be
brought
to
this
court's
attention
and
that
is
appearing
on
pages
48,
the
bottom
of
page
48
and
the
top
of
page
49
of
the
government's
brief,
where
they
allege
that
mr.
womack
was
advertising
his
own
merchandise
in
carrying
an
advertisement
of
vulcan
studios,
tony
of
vulcan
studios.
everyone
at
the
post
office,
from
the
postal
inspectors
through
the
hearing
examiners,
everyone
that
does
have
anything
to
do
with
mr.
womack
know
that
he
was
not
tony
of
vulcan
studios
that
this
tony
of
vulcan
studios
is
entirely
different
person
and
we
feel
that
this
should
be
brought
to
the
court's
attention
because
it's
just
incorrect.
there's
no
--
there's
no
question
that
this
is
just
an
incorrect
statement.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
record,
the
postal
--
postal
inspector,
harry
simon
testified
that
he
had
extreme
difficulty
in
purchasing
anything
that
was
supposed
to
have
been
obscene
from
the
photographers.
and
the
way
that
he,
the
postal
inspector,
would
conduct
his
investigation
would
be
to
mail
out
what
he
called
test
letters.
well,
we
did
the
same
thing,
that
is
the
publisher
of
this
magazine
did
the
same
thing
and
he
even
went
further,
and
he
expended
more
money
than
the
postal
inspectors
did
because
he
actually
found
materials
that
were
not
to
his
taste
and
he
did
delete
those
particular
photos
--
photographers
from
his
magazines.
now,
the
third
point
that
i
have
in
this
case
is
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
prior
restraint
exercised
upon
these
magazines
and
that
requires,
in
part
a
consideration
of
the
regulations
and
in
part
a
consideration
of
the
time
sequence
and
the
way
that
these
regulations
were
applied.
now
in
the
government's
brief,
page
3,
they
have
in
their
statement
of
facts,
march
25th
was
the
date
that
this
material
was
placed
in
the
mail
by
us,
march
25th,
1960.
you'll
notice
that
the
next
date
is
april
5th
and
april
5th
was
the
date
that
we
received
the
letter
--
no,
excuse
me,
april
5th
is
the
date
that
the
letter
was
dated
that
was
supposedly
mailed
to
us,
informing
us
that
this
material
was
being
held
by
the
general
counsel
of
the
postal
office
department
because
they
considered
it
to
be
obscene.
i
noticed
in
the
rules
of
the
post
office
that
is
supposed
--
that
is
supposed
to
follow
as
set
forth
in
the
back
of
the
page
81,
it's
in
appendix
8
to
the
government's
brief.
rule
1
-
limitation,
rule
2
-
initiation
because
rule
1
goes
into
the
question
of
how
much
money
is
involved.
rule
2
on
initiation
it
says,
“upon
receipt
of
mail
matter,
of
doubtful
mailability,
etcetera”
referring
to
the
provision
of
the
code,
“submitted
by
a
postmaster,
the
general
counsel
shall
(a)
file
a
complaint
with
the
docket
clerk.”
now,
this
material
was
stopped
on
the
25th
of
march,
1960.
april
5th
is
when
we
have
received
the
letter
stating
that
they
feel
that
this
material
is
non-mailable.
i
say
again,
not
we
received,
but
when
they
supposed
to
have
mailed
the
letter,
april
5th.
now,
april
11th,
1960,
they
have
in
their
brief
in
the
bottom
of
page
3
that
we
have
challenged
this
letter.
well,
we
did.
we
have
filed
formal
complaint
with
the
post
office
about
it,
but,
we
went
further
than
that.
on
that
date,
april
11th,
we
received
or
we
asked
for
and
received
the
temporary
restraining
order
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and,
of
course,
in
the
bottom
of
page
4,
in
the
footnote
1,
the
government's
brief
says
temporary
restraining
order
was
denied
on
april
13th.
well,
this
is
a
little
bit
of
an
error
because
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
granted
on
the
11th.
now,
what
happened
was
two
days
later,
on
the
13th,
we
had
a
hearing
on
the
preliminary
injunction
which
was
denied,
giving
us
the
right
to
come
back
to
the
court,
if
we
did
not
receive
a
hearing
or
to
conclude
a
hearing
by
the
28th
of
that
month.
now,
the
point
that
i
--
i
wish
to
raise
with
this
court
and
why
this
counsel
feels
that's
important
that
these
magazines
are
dated.
each
one
of
these
magazines
had
got
a
date
on
them.
now,
if
they
--
according
to
their
rules,
if
they
can
take
a
magazine
and
keep
it
for
10
to
12
days
before
they
are
supposed
to
send
you
a
letter
saying
that
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
continue
through
the
mails
with
this
magazine
before
they
even
start
in,
the
mechanism
for
having
a
hearing
then
by
the
time,
this
hearing
is
finally
granted,
if
ever,
your
magazines
are
no
longer
saleable
because
the
month
has
passed.
and
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
the
alternative,
sir,
is
three-fold.
i
have
set
this
forward
in
my
brief
because,
i
weren't
familiar
with
it
because
the
month
before
they
had
stopped
the
magazine
that
is
exhibit
number
4,
which
is
the
trim,
march
1960
issue
of
trim
magazine.
that
was
stopped
the
month
before
and
they
gave
us
this
letter
which
said,
“you
can
come
and
--
and
get
your
materials
and
--
and
withdraw
it
from
the
mails
or
you
can
go
ahead
and
request
the
--
the
hearing.”
now,
to
withdraw
it
from
the
mail
that
means
that
we
have
to
ship
it
by
freight,
railway
express
and
of
course,
this
is
second
class
mailing
privileges
were
in
effect
at
this
time
and
the
expense
wise
tremendous
difference
between
shipping
by
mail
and
shipping
by
--
by
freight.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
as
of
this
date?
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
40,000
or
more
a
month.
it's
pretty
good.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
yes,
according
to
the
way
that
the
statute
is
written.
in
fairness,
i
have
to
say,
yes.
the
statute
says
that
all
obscene
material
is
non-mailable.
i've
read
the
government's
brief.
they
went
back
into
the
--
the
particular
background
of
the
law
and
said
that
they
didn't
want
to
stop.
they
have
even
been
accepted,
i
have
to
agree
with
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
have
never
said
it's
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
the
mails.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
that's
the
point,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i
had
to
go
and
get
a
temporary
restraining
order
for
the
district
court
just
to
get
a
hearing.
that's
what
we
asked
for
when
we
went
to
judge
tamm,
was
a
hearing
because
according
to
the
rules,
when
they
send
you
a
copy
of
the
rule
and
of
the
way
that
the
post
office
were
working
it
in
this
particular
case,
by
the
time
we
would
have
ever
gotten
to
a
hearing,
you
could
have
forgotten
about
the
magazine
because
it
was
--
it
was
a
month
afterwards
and
you
can't
sell.
you
can't
sell
a
may
magazine
in
--
in
june.
this
is
the
information
that
i
have
received,
mr.
justice.
i
have
been
told
that
you
take
a
magazine
like
this
and
there
are
people
--
now,
these
are
sold
mostly
from
newsstands,
exactly
the
same
way
that
all
other
magazines
in
this
field
are
sold
and
these
magazines,
i
didn't
mentioned
it
before
but
the
records
shows
that
the
testimony
of
the
government's
psychiatrist,
these
magazines
are
exactly
the
same
in
content,
the
type
of
pictures
and
everything
else
just
like
every
other
physique
magazine
sold.
we
have
them
all
down
at
the
--
at
the
postal
hearing
and
showed
them
and
were
com
--
compared
by
the
psychiatrist
for
the
government
with
all
magazines
and
he
said
they
were
all
the
same,
had
the
same
kind
of
pictures.
everything
was
exactly
the
same.
may
i
be
permitted
to
reserve
some
of
the
argument
time
to
answer?
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
which
one
of
my
points,
mr.
justice?
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
have
--
i
have
three
claims.
one,
i
feel
that
these
magazines
are
not
obscene
as
laid
down
by
this
court's,
as
testified
in
this
court's
definition,
that's
number
one.
number
two
is
i
feel
that
the
way
that
they
have
treated
us
in
the
prior
restraint
exercise
in
the
post
office
department
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
they
stopped
this
stuff
before
--
before
it
was
ever
actually
carried
in
the
mail.
this
was
--
this
particular
set,
these
four
books
were
stopped.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
when
it
was
offered.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
when
it
was
offered.
it
was
offered
put
in
--
put
into
the
post
office.
our
men
walked
away
and
we
did
not
know
that
it
was
not
accepted
but
they
actually
stopped
it
at
that
point
and
held
it
from
march
25th
until
april
5th
when
they
wrote
us
a
letter
and
said
that
they
were
holding
it.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
say
that
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
this
is
not
like
near-minnesota,
near
v.
minnesota.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
this
is
not
quite
like
that.
no,
although
i
will
say
this
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
yes,
that
--
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
not
spelled
out
in
that
many
words.
it's
in
the
general
--
the
general
wording
of
title
18
1461
saying
that
all
obscene
material
is
declared
to
be
non-mailable.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
when
you
say
assumed
it's
obscene,
you
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
--
you
sort
of
--
sort
of
would
pull
the
rug
out
from
under
it
--
i
don't
deny
--
i
don't
deny
the
postmaster
general's
power
that
said
is
something
blatantly
obscene,
a
hardcore
pornography,
put
it
in
the
mails
in
a
--
in
a
french
postcard
let's
say,
where
it's
right
open.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
it's
not
spelled
out
in
any
statute
but
it
--
it's
--
you
might
say
that
it
is
construed
from
the
wording
of
title
18
section
1461
wherein
the
congress
has
said
that
obscene
material
is
non-mailable
and
shall
not
be
carried.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
am
not
challenging
his
power.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
i
feel,
number
one
it's
not
obscene.
i
would
agree
with
your
statement
of
the
question
in
that
way,
but
i
would
go
a
little
bit
further
and
i
say
that
i'd
--
i
think
that
if
the
postmaster
general
has
these
certain
rules
laid
out
for
him
on
how
he
or
his
agents
are
to
act,
whether
or
not
this
material
is
obscene,
these
are
his
rules
and
he's
got
to
play
the
--
the
game
by
his
rules.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i'm
in
no
position
to
argue
against
it.
i
think
this
court
actually
decided
that
in
the
roth
case.
i
was
--
as
--
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
that
is
--
yes,
that
is
the
last
point
that
i
--
that
i
raised
in
my
brief.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
for
right
--
for
the
right
from
the
outset.
they
received
this
material
on
march
25th.
if
this
material
was
considered
obscene
then
they
should
have
immediately
and
according
to
their
rules
upon
receipt
of
such
material
is
to
file,
through
his
general
counsel,
is
to
file
a
complaint
against
the
material.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
--
you
were
the
--
the
member
of
this
court
who
wrote
the
kingsley
books
case.
now,
in
that
case,
one
of
the
points
you
brought
forward
was
that
the
saving
factor
of
this
--
unless
this
counsel
is
mistaken,
one
of
the
saving
factors
of
this
statute
in
new
york
was
you
want
an
injunction,
you
get
it
today.
you
have
a
hearing
on
it
within
one
day
after
joinder
of
issue
and
a
decision
within
two
days.
and
that
was
one
of
the
saving
factors
as
i
understood.
there's
no
such
--
there's
no
such
in
these
rules
that
the
post
office
had.
that
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
that
is
part
of
it,
sir.
that
is
part
of
it.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
understand.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
understood
that
as
well,
mr.
justice.
well,
as
you
see
now,
a
part
of
it,
of
course,
is
a
fact
that
they
didn't
play
by
their
own
rules
and
part
of
it
is
that
their
rules
themselves
are
inherently
vague.
now,
maybe
the
rules
would
be
alright
if
this
material
that
was
to
be
carried
through
the
mail
was
something
that
was
not
dated,
that
it
didn't
matter.
when
i
say,
alright,
as
far
as
this
counsel
and
--
and
with
these
clients
concerned.
if
it
was
not
dated
material,
it
was
not
something
that
had
to
be
brought
to
the
mail
for
purpose
to
get
it
out
in
timely
sale,
i
say
then
it
might
be
different.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
i
--
i
agree
with
--
at
this
point,
i
can
see
what's
behind
that
question
and
i
--
may
i
say
this,
week
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well
then,
let
--
may
i
say
that
once
herman
womack
was
convicted
in
the
federal
court,
here,
the
post
office
made
up
their
mind
that
they
were
going
to
stop
these
magazines
and
that's
when
we
started
getting
--
each
month
they
started
grabbing
our
magazines
and
that
--
that's
what
actually
happened.
so,
you
might
say
that
the
postmaster
general
has
the
authority
to
hold
from
the
mails
obscene
material,
i
don't
argue
that.
you
asked
me
if
this
was
comparable
to
a
case
where
the
--
in
the
future
they're
going
to
hold
material
from
the
mail,
that's
why
i
thought
of
near
versus
minnesota.
well,
actually
they
had
intention
of
holding
every
single
magazine
that
this
man
was
associated
with.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no,
there's
no
question
about
that.
that
is
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
this
point
was
never
brought
out
in
any
testimony.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
alright.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
and
i
--
i
don't
care
to
argue
something
that's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no.
not
that
--
i
--
i
haven't
raised
that
in
the
brief.
i
have
nowhere
in
--
in
any
of
my
briefs
asserted
that
even
though
this
was
always
my
--
now,
i
would
go
further
and
say
my
personal
opinion
this
was
a
conclusion
and
that
it
was
based
upon
statements
made
to
me
as
counsel.
i
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
fully
answer
the
question
post
by
mr.
justice
black
as
to
the
--
whether
or
not
the
dates
were
of
importance.
i
started
to
--
i
think
i
got
off
by
another
attention.
i
am
informed
that
when
the
month
goes
by
and
let's
say
this
magazine
now
holding
exhibit
1,
april
manual
when
this
magazine
has
the
time
has
gone
by
and
the
next
issue
is
on
the
street,
that
the
top
will
be
torn
off,
the
piece
that
has
the
date
will
be
torn
off
and
then,
of
course,
they
will
try
to
sell
it
at
a
reduced
price
which
of
course
--.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
50
cents,
your
honor,
50
cents
each
magazine.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
yes,
this
is
--
there
were
some
more
expensive.
there
are
magazines
that
are
little
bit
larger
in
size.
when
i
say
larger
in
size,
larger
photographs,
pages
are
larger
and
not
more
pages,
just
larger
and
they're
made
by
a
gentleman
who
--
new
jersey,
named
weider
and
i
think
his
magazine
sell
for
a
dollar
and
he
does
have
some
annual
magazines
that
sell
for
$1.50
or
$5
annual
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
yes,
annual
magazines.
may
i
reserve
some
time?
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
might
in
response
to
the
light
that
the
court
was
following,
continue
right
along
with
that
at
page
63
of
the
record.
now,
i
was
present
when
these
statements
were
made
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
post
office
department,
general
counsel's
office
by
the
publisher
and
it
appears
on
page
63
of
the
record.
this
dr.
womack,
he
had
a
lot
of
fun
baiting
the
post
office
department
with
this
type
of
statement.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no
this
is
it
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
this
is
in
the
record
your
honor,
this
is
in
the
record.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
where
is
in
the
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well
no,
that
--
that
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no,
i'm
not
expert
on
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
yes
--
he
was.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
he
--
he
was
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
alright.
he
disclosed
it
in
a
way
--
to
say
well,
have
you
ever
heard
(inaudible),
what
does
that
mean?
this
doctor
is
legal.
that's
the
way
he
disclosed
it.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
don't
deny
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
don't
deny
this
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i'm
setting
--
no,
i
am
not
telling
you
what
was
really
inside
his
mind
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
--
i'm
telling
the
--
the
setting
that
this
statement
was
made
in,
he
walked
in
to
the
lion's
den,
they
admit
and
admitted
on
cross-examination
that
they
were
trying
to
bring
this
out
from
him,
he
knew
this
in
advance.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
what,
to
investigate
this
case?
i'm
not
saying
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
oh
no.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
let's
put
at
this
way.
he
was
not
required
to
go
down
there
and
make
these
statements.
he
went
in
there
intentionally
for
a
purpose
and
the
purpose
was
to
bait
the
post
office.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
he
was
very
proud
at
the
fact
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no,
he
was
very
proud
the
fact
that
he
could
send
this
material
and
that
the
post
office
couldn't
touch
him
according
to
him.
now
that
was
his
--
his
complete
statement.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
never
your
honor
i
we'll
explain
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
--
that
fully.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
yes.
and
--
and
i
will
explain
the
record.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
have
planned
to
argue
that
point.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
think
that
appears
on
pages
27
and
28,
but
may
i
conclude
what
i
have
in
my
mind
now?
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
as
far
as
--
as
far
as
dr.
womack
was
concerned,
please
remember
that
he
had
been
investigated
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
he
had
been
investigated
several
times
by
postal
inspector
harry
simon
coming
around
to
his
place
with
these
magazines
were
printed
over
a
period
of
time.
and
each
time,
it
was
always
persisting
questioning,
is
this
stuff
going
to
homosexuals,
going
to
homosexuals,
tended
for
homosexuals.
and
it
got
to
the
point
were
womack
actually
felt
so
secure
that
he
attempted
to
tease
everyone
that
inquire
about
this,
but
if
you
will
further
into
the
record,
you
will
see
that
womack
at
every
point
has
said.
these
magazines
are
sold
to
newsstands
and
no
one
really
knows
who
the
purchasers
might
be
and
there
is
over
40,000
of
them
sold
a
month.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
from
the
record
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
believe
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
yes,
i
believe
that
on
three
occasions,
testimony
of
harry
simon,
the
postal
inspector
is
on
three
different
occasions
he
came
to
womack's
close
--
place
of
business
to
discuss
this
with
him
and
that
womack
would
give
these
answers.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
oh
no.
this
is
my
recollection
on
the
testimony.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
ironic
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
they
never
asked
him
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
he
--
he
never
came
right
out
and
said
that
i
am
saying
these
things
just
at
to
--
to
kid
you,
but
in
the
testimony
of
the
counsel
for
the
government,
who
was
asked
him,
he
says
himself
that
i
kept
asking
him
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
--
whether
it's
what
for
homosexual.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
use
--
i
use
fooling,
teasing.
i
wouldn't
say
that
he
did
mean
it.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
believe
that
in
part,
he
meant
it,
in
part.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
the
answer
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
the
answer
mr.
justice
is
that
nobody
really
knows.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
who
--
whom
the
purchasers
of
these
magazines
are,
because
they
have
sold
through
newsstands
and
there
is
no
human
being
who
could
honestly,
truthfully
say
that
x,
y,
z,
class
of
people
are
the
only
purchasers
of
this
magazine
and
that
is
the
only
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
--
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i'm
not
aware
of
what
you
referring,
you
mean
in
--
oh
in
our
magazine.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well
if
it
said
that
then
it
was
reproduced
from
reader's
digest
i
assume.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
aware
of
which
one.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
there
is
a
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
maybe
i
misunderstood
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
he
asked
me
if
i
conceded
or
at
any
point
if
i
conceded
that
this
was
beamed
to
the
homosexuals.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
by
dr.
womack,
yes,
yes
it
was.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
as
you
asked
me
the
question
mr.
justice,
i'm
not
an
expert
on
the
inside
of
his
mind,
but
in
my
opinion,
i
would
say
that
he
meant
it
in
part.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
because
he
meant
certainly
to
say
these
things
if
there
no
other
reason
then
to
get
back
at
the
interrogated
from
the
post
office
department
and
teased
them.
and
i
believe
further
--
i'll
--
i'll
take
a
step
and
go
away
out
on
the
lame,
i
believe
further
that
he
might
have
actually
meant
this
to
be
true.
in
his
own
mind,
he
might
have
believed
that
all
of
these
magazines
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
--
would
be
purchased
by
homosexuals.
i'll
go
that
far,
but
that's
just
his
belief.
it's
still
cannot
--
you
just
cannot
get
around
the
fact
that
all
of
these
magazines
are
sold
from
newsstands
and
no
matter
what
he
believes,
no
matter
what
i
believe,
no
matter
what
i
believe,
no
matter
what
any
individual
member
this
court
might
believe,
they
are
still
sold
from
newsstands
and
no
one
knows
for
sure.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
wouldn't
argue
against
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
that
is
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
that
is
dr.
womack.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
his
name
is
herman
lynn
womack.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
that
letter,
i
don't
even
have
to
read
it.
i've
seen
that
letter.
that's
the
one
where
is
--
i
think
it's
written
to
a
mercury
studios
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
--
and
that's
the
one
were
it
says
in
1958,
we
want
a
truck
driver
type,
it's
all
showered
up,
clean
and
ready
for
bed.
that
letter
was
directed
to
one
particular
photographer
who
submitted
photographs
that
we
used
in
this
magazine
and
apparently,
this
particular
photographer's
work
was
models
who
were
rough
and
tough
and
dirty
looking
and
this
was
an
attempt
to
get
the
models
to
be
better
appearance.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
to
use
in
the
magazines.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
--
let's
--
let's
say
this
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
let
say
that
--
that
it
was
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
--
for
homosexuals.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
let's
say
that
it
was
intended
to
get
this
particular
photograph
for
use
to
appeal
to
a
homosexual.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
won't
argue
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
won't
argue
against
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
let's
say
it's
a
concession
that
he
wasn't
in
looking,
overlooking
any
part
of
the
american
market
in
his
attempt
to
sell
his
magazines.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
that
he
was
not
overlooking
any
part
of
this
portion
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
this
--
this
is
just
one
photographers
worked
mr.
chief
justice.
you
will
notice
in
the
back
of
directory
of
the
magazines,
there
are
some
40
or
so
names
listed
as
contributing
photographers
to
these
magazines,
but,
this
--
this
counsel
has
trouble
in
my
own
mind,
with
this
--
this
problem.
i
--
i
mentioned
that
yesterday,
even
if
these
magazines
are
beamed
--
magazines
which
are
at
homosexuals,
if
there's
such
a
thing
as
a
class
of
people
named
homosexuals,
if
these
magazines
are
beamed
off,
then
what
does
this
one,
inc.
versus
olesen
case
stand
for?
are
homosexuals
allow
to
receive
the
pick
ups
or
literature
that
they
may
chose
to
purchase
or
--
or
they
to
be
censored
out
of
that
because
we,
as
so
called
normal
people
don't
like
homosexuals.
it's
not
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
don't
go
quite
as
far
as
the
chief
justice's
question.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
when
you
say
where
that
there
--
to
go
to
homosexuals
to
appeal
to
their
prurient
interest.
i
don't
go
this
far,
you
see
because
i
don't
--
as
i
see
the
testimony
and
the
psychiatrists,
i
don't
feel
that
it
holds
that
far.
now,
the
government
--
i
didn't
want
to
get
in
to
this
particular
--
you
put
me
on
the
spot,
but
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
didn't
want
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
you
are
exactly
correct
in
that
premise,
but
i
think
in
your
question,
you
went
a
little
bit
further
and
said
these
magazines
are
going
to
arouse
--
and
maybe
i
miss
understood
your
question.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
arouse
some
prurient
interest
in
the
homosexual.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
my
argument
is
that
these
--
these
magazines
are
not
going
to
cause
any
unlawful
actions.
now,
may
i
say
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
that
is
one
part
of
my
argument
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no
that's
just
one
part
it.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
the
other
part
is
that
these
magazines
could
not
in
--
if
they
were
just
purchased
by
homosexuals,
these
magazines
could
not
clause
the
unlawful
actions
that
the
psychiatrists
claim
they
could.
the
government
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
my
time
is
running
out.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
me
a
question
whether
i
had
at
anytime
conceded
that
these
magazines
were
homosexual
magazines.
i've
never
conceded
that
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
--
27
--
the
government
claims
that
i
give
in
the
record
on
page
28,
but
if
you
will
examine
page
27
of
the
record,
you
will
see
that
when
i
was
questioning
this
witness,
i
started
all
my
questions
as
appear
on
28
were
of
the
magazine
--
using
the
magazine
one
incorporated,
which
this
court
had
ruled
upon
in
its
prior
case
one
inc.
versus
olesen.
i
had
used
this
magazine
to
show,
to
compare
with
the
psychiatrists
in
my
cross-examination
of
him.
i
showed
them
the
magazine,
this
picture
in
the
magazine,
is
this
worst
in
the
pictures
in
our
magazine?
he
said,
yes
wanted
appeal
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
also
showed
him
the
sunshine
&
health
magazine.
this
is
also
in
the
record,
which
this
court
had
ruled
to
be
not
obscene
or
at
least
mailable
and
the
photographs
that
were
therein
contained
and
in
that
magazine
and
he
also
testified
and
it's
in
the
record
that
that
these
magazines
would
be
--
even
more
appealing
to
the
prurient
interest
of
a
homosexual
because
of
a
complete
nudity
of
the
particular
model.
and
mr.
--
mr.
justice
stewart
hit
the
nail
right
on
the
head
when
he
said
that
he
assumes
at
the
empires
state
building
would
appeal
to
some
erotic
interest
in
some
people.
well,
this
was
my
argument
and
it
appears
in
the
record
that
there
was
so
many
myriad
of
different
things
that
would
appeal
to
homosexual
that
you
could
not
possibly
have
any
sort
of
a
photographic
magazine
without
appealing
to
--
to
some
different
face
of
homosexuals
which
goes
back
to
what
i
argued
to
the
chief
justice
yesterday
that
you
cannot
have
any
standards,
because
there
was
so
many
different
degrees
in
this
category
of
people
and
mr.
kinsey
phrased
that
out
and
we've
argued
that
in
our
--
in
our
brief.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
in
--
in.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
there
is
--
there
is
right
mail
your
honor.
there
is
right
mail
being
imported
in
this
country
--
the
christ,
the
christ
is
a
magazine.
it
comes
from
germany.
it's
in
german
and
it's
a
nudist
magazine
and
the
post
office
every
time
--
every
time
they
catch
it,
well,
they
have
--
they
try
to
stop
it.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
picked
the
full
one
of
the
questions
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no,
well
i'm
--
i'm
against
--
i'm
against
the
post
office
stop
at
anything
in
the
mail
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
how
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
if
you
follow
--
if
follow
that
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
if
you
follow
the
--
the
government's
view
yes,
if
you
follow
all
you
know
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
say
no.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
don't
think
that
--
in
this
particular
case
or
that
you
have
mentioned,
i
don't
think
that
the
post
office
would
have
that
right.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
it's
not
going
to
appeal
to
prurie
--
prurient
interest
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
--
i'd
like
to
be
able
to
answer.
let's
say
that
they
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
we
feel
that
it
is.
the
government
deems
it
is
not.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no
your
honor,
i
did
not.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no
i
did
not
and
i
did
not
--
i
did
not
ask
for
a
jury
trail
in
the
administrative
proceeding.
it
wasn't
provided
in
their
rules
as
i
said
yesterday.
i
tried
to
play
ball
by
their
rules
even
though
they
didn't
play
ball
by
their
rules
and
i
see
all
a
lights
are
flashing
on
me
but
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
would
like
to
--
i
did
like
to
--
all
the
justices
seem
interested
on
the
government's
examination,
the
government's
argument,
about
the
sequence
of
events
here.
well,
now
i
have
before
me
and
it's
in
the
record,
the
letters
of
april
5th
and
april
7th
and
of
course
the
letter
of
march
1st
which
was
the
first
one
that
we
had
received.
as
i
stated
yesterday,
they
stopped
our
issue.
now,
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
question
yesterday
about
womack's
conviction.
womack
was
convicted
in
the
end
of
january
of
1960,
i
believe
it
was
a
28th
and
29th.
the
next
week,
these
magazines
which
would
have
hit
the
mail
to
the
first
week
in
february,
they
were
stopped,
although
we
were
not
notified
of
it
until
march
1st
1960
is
the
letter
that
we've
received
notifying
us
that
these
magazines
--
that
some
of
these
magazines
had
been
stopped,
not
all.
they
were
withdrawn
from
the
mail.
that
--
that
was
the
first
part
of
it.
and
in
that
--
and
it's
very
interesting
that
the
government
did
never
rely
on
any
other
section
of
the
code
in
any
of
these
proceedings
except
section
1461
and
each
time
if
they
stop
any
raw
material,
they
give
us
some
of
section
1461
along
with
the
rules
of
procedure.
now,
on
april
5th
and
april
7th,
they
wrote
to
us
and
of
course
april
5th,
they
told
us
that
they
had
stopped
these
magazines
which
had
been
mailed
on
the
25th
of
march
and
then
they
gave
us
10
days
in
which
to
come
in
and
object
to
their
procedure,
they
--
and
--
just
time
sequence.
so
actually
what
we
did
was
we
went
to
the
district
court
and
in
the
district
court,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
yesterday
why
we
didn't
flood
the
mail
with
materials
during
the
day
and
a
half
or
two
days
that
we
had
on
temporary
restraining
order,
in
that
case
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
all
that
we
went
in
to
the
district
court
and
asked
for
was
an
administrative
hearing,
which
by
the
--
they
--
they
were
apparently
trying
to
deny
us
this
hearing.
we
were
not
trying
to
get
around
the
hearing.
we
came
in
to
court
and
asked
for
a
hearing.
and
i
have
the
original
complaint
here,
the
motion
for
the
first
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
we've
got
a
restraining
order.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
mr.
doolittle
possibly
made
it
clear
to
your
mind
but
not
to
mine.
we
had
the
time,
but
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
we
didn't
--
yes.
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
attempt
to.
we
didn't
attempt
to
evade
anything.
we
just
wanted
to
get
the
hearing.
and
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
you
asked
the
question
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
didn't
think
so
because
i
am
very
familiar
for
me
with
these
magazines,
although
the
gentlemen
at
the
post
office
and
this
appears
in
the
record,
all
--
the
expert
so
forth
call
the
experts
on
obscenity
to
post
office
(inaudible)
read
one
word
to
text
for
many
of
magazines.
even
the
psychiatrist
who
testified
that
the
use
to
change
was
supposed
to
have
been
so
bad
because
it
appealed
to
some
advocates
that
wants
to
be
changed
up
and
beaten
to
the
death.
this
use
to
change
in
that
photograph
was
illustrating
an
article
pernicious.
i
asked
to
gentleman
--
the
doctor,
was
he
is
ever
heard
a
pernicious,
know
anything
about
it
and
this
was
article
in
our
book
and
he
confessed
complete
ignorance
and
then
said
that
he
--
he's
not
--
he's
not
expert
on
those
kind
of
matters.
and
then
you
also
asked
a
question
mr.
justice
black
which
--
whether
there
are
such
things
as
the
experts
on
obscenity,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
smith
versus
california,
a
very
strong
concurring
opinion
which
i
have
attempted
to
use
in
other
case
to
get
courts
to
listen
to
experts,
but
apparently,
they
don't
follow
this
particularly.
they
hold
there's
no
such
thing
as
expert.
