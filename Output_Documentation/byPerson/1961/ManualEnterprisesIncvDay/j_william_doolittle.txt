mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
will
usually
have
perceived
by
now
that
we
are
dealing
in
this
case
with
a
rather
unusual
type
of
publication.
one
that
is,
i
suggest,
the
peculiarly
insidious
form
of
obscenity
in
that,
while
it
appears
to
the
average
man
to
be
far
less
objectionable
than
the
usual
forms
of
pornography
in
fact,
it
has
far
more
serious
effect
upon
its
audience
than
ordinary
pornography
has
on
the
average
audience.
the
leading
commentators
on
obscenity
and
the
law,
lockhart
and
mcclure,
have
described
this
type
of
publication
as
the
pseudo-physical
culture
magazine.
with
court's
indulgence,
i
should
like
very
briefly
to
read
their
most
apt
description
of
this
genre
of
publication.
“although,
not
a
charles'
atlas
magazine,
they
say,
it
would
have
appeared
to
the
normal
heterosexual
male
only
as
a
rather
bizarre
magazine
because
of
the
unusual
clothing
worn
by
the
muscular
men
pictured
in
its
photographs
and
peculiar
settings
and
props
included
in
the
photographs.
analyzed
by
a
psychiatrist
or
a
psychologist,
however,
the
magazine
took
on
an
entirely
different
character.
it
was
then
seen
for
what
it
really
was,
a
magazine
for
male
homosexuals
to
whom
the
clothing,
settings
and
props
had
symbolic
meaning.
now,
because
of
the
character
of
the
appeal
of
these
magazines,
these
writers,
lockhart
and
mcclure
assumed
that
such
material
should
be
characterized
as
hardcore
pornography.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
lockhart
and
mcclure,
mr.
justice
harlan
and
the
writing
in
45
minnesota
law
review
i
was
quoting
it,
pages
98
and
99.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
the
basis
of
--
of
what
they
were
talking
about
--
actually,
they
were
not
--
they
wrote
this
when
this
case
was
just
beginning.
apparently,
they
didn't
even
know
about
this
case.
they
were
writing
and
the
citation
they
give
is
advice
of
psychologists
at
university
of
minnesota.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
what
we
have
here
today,
i
submit,
is
precisely
the
same
as
i
shall
try
to
show
you
by
at
least
brief
references
to
the
record.
in
the
time
available
to
me
i
propose
first
to
argue
that
in
concluding
that
these
magazines
are
obscene
and
therefore
non-mailable,
the
post
office
and
the
courts
below
properly
judged
them
in
relation
to
the
average
person
in
their
special
audience
rather
than
the
average
person
in
the
community.
i
shall
only
touch
very
briefly
upon
the
alternative
ground
that
these
magazines
are
non-mailable
because
they
contain
information
as
to
where
obscene
material
may
be
obtained.
and
finally,
i
shall
argue
that
the
statutory
and
administrative
scheme
by
which
these
magazines
were
found
obscene
and
therefore,
were
excluded
from
the
mails,
did
not
constitute
a
prior
restraint
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
as
a
pa
--
passage,
i
read
to
you
from
lockhart
and
mcclure
indicates
it
is
necessary
in
looking
at
magazines
such
as
these
and
to
consider
the
psychiatric
and
psychological
testimony
that
was
adduced
with
respect
to
them.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
not
at
all,
mr.
justice.
this
case
got
going
in
the
very
first
instance
when
in
--
on
april
25th
of
1960.
now,
the
magazines
at
issue
were
deposited
in
the
mails
in
alexandria,
virginia.
now,
i
should
like
to
point
out
at
this
juncture
that
the
issues
are
the
march
and
may
issues
of
one
magazine,
the
april
issue
of
another
magazine
and
the
may
issue
of
the
third
magazine.
i
suggest
this
fact
as
highly
irrelevant
in
considering
the
importance
of
the
dates
of
these
magazines
which,
of
course,
don't
contain
any
sort
of
current
events
matter.
the
magazines
other
than
the
dates
on
the
cover
are
pretty
much
identical
to
one
another
in
their
format
and
content.
these
magazines
or
samples
of
them
were
then
sent
by
the
postmaster
at
alexandria
to
the
general
counsel's
office
of
the
post
office
department
here
in
washington
pursuant
to
the
regulations
which
require
that
when
he
has
any
question
of
the
mailability
of
matters
submitted
to
him,
he
will
send
it
to
the
central
authority
in
washington
for
a
determination
as
to
or,
i
should
say,
for
further
instructions.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no,
there's
nothing,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
has
been
convicted
of
sending
obscene
matter
through
the
mails.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
i
believe
that
they
are
slightly
in
advance
of
--
of
these.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
oh,
there's
certainly
might.
oh,
i
--
i
don't
doubt
that
for
a
minute.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
necessarily
--
that
you
must
necessarily
assume
from
the
record
that
--
yes
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no,
the
record
really
does
not
request
one
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
quite
possible,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no,
his
--
his
name
does
not
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no,
his
name
does
not
appear
on
them,
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
record
taken
as
a
whole
would
strongly
suggest
that
the
post
office
department
was
aware
of
his
activities
and
the
fact
that
he
was
in
fact
a
publisher
of
these
magazines.
i
don't
--
i
don't
question
that
for
a
moment.
now,
these
--
as
i
say,
these
magazines
or
samples
of
them
were
sent
to
the
general
counsel's
office
in
the
post
office
department
here
in
washington
and
he
sent
letters
on
april
5th
and
7th,
1960
to
mr.
womack
as
president
of
the
magazines
stating
that
in
his
opinion
they
were
non-mailable.
now,
an
important
fact
as
far
as
that
particular
event
is
concerned
is
that
he
also
stated
that
in
his
opinion,
they
were
not
of
sufficient
value
to
require
a
hearing
under
the
regulations
and
for
that
reason,
he
did
not,
at
that
time,
file
a
complaint
with
the
post
office
department.
now,
this
is
pursuant
to
section
203.1
of
the
post
office
regulations,
which
is
sited
on
page
81
of
our
brief,
where
he
is
to
make
this
determination
on
value,
which
may
be
appealed
to
the
judicial
officer.
well,
upon
receipt
of
this
letter,
the
publishers
of
these
magazines
did
immediately
appeal
that
decision
to
the
judicial
officer
of
the
post
office
department,
that
is,
that
decision
that
these
were
not
of
sufficient
value
to
require
a
mailability
proceeding
and
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
the
record
does
not
reflect,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
specific
dividing
line.
the
regulations
merely
say
that
they
must
be
or
that
--
that
in
order
for
these
rules
to
be
a
--
applicable,
they
shall
be
of
substantial
value
--
value
or
quantity.
now,
the
judicial
officer
upon
receiving
this
appeal
did
rule
that
they
were
of
substantial
value
and
quantity
and
that
if
the
general
counsel
wish
--
wished
to
proceed
further,
he
must
immediately
file
a
complaint,
which
he
promptly
did.
now,
two
days
prior
to
that,
as
mr.
dietz
has
pointed
out,
counsel
for
these
magazines
did
go
into
district
court
to
seek
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
was
granted
and
ex
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
now,
as
i
say,
his
--
his
initial
determination
was
that
they
were
not
of
substantial
value
or
quantity.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
he
was
overruled
and
upon
his
being
overruled,
he
immediately
filed
a
complaint.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
he
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
the
injunction
--
the
suit
for
an
injunction
was
filed
immediately
prior
or
actually
two
days
prior
to
the
judicial
off
--
officer's
ruling
that
these
were
of
substantial
value,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
actually,
as
i
recall
the
procedure
on
the
11th,
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
granted
ex
parte
and
the
next
day,
the
post
office
came
in
and
--
and
pointed
out
that
they
have
mailability
procedures
and
upon
learning
that,
the
district
judge
then
made
any
--
any
further
judicial
action
dependent
upon
the
holding
of
the
hearing.
actually,
what
he
said
--
what
he
did
was
he
denied
a
further
injunction
without
prejudice
to
the
right
of
the
petitioners
to
come
in
if
a
hearing
had
not
been
completed
by
a
date
certain.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no,
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
against
holding
the
material
against
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that's
right,
against
preventing
it
from
going
through
the
mails.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no,
they
didn't
upon
--
upon
the
government's
becoming
aware
of
this
ruling,
they
immediately
went
in
and
--
and
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no.
there's
actually,
i
believe,
there's
only
one
day
in
between.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no,
no.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
there
were
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that's
right.
there
--
that
the
--
the
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
suggest
that
that's
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
i
suggest
that
that's
merely
a
question
of
--
of
the
very
closeness
of
the
time.
i
--
i
would
guess
that
the
postmaster
ge
--
the
postmaster
in
alexandria
may
not
even
have
heard
that
--
that
the
injunction
has
been
issued
until
he
also
heard
that
the
further
judicial
action
was
taken.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
the
judicial
officers,
i
say,
ordered
that
the
general
counsel
either
file
a
complaint
or
ordered
the
material
released.
on
the
14th
of
april,
he
did
file
a
complaint.
petitioners
responded
on
the
18th
of
april.
hearing
was
set
for
the
21st
of
april
and
the
judicial
officer,
it
took
three
days
after
the
hearings
and
the
judicial
officer
issued
his
opinion
on
the
28th
of
april.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
it
was.
it
was
a
full
adversary
hearing.
i
will
--
when
i'm
dealing
more
specifically
with
the
prior
restraint
point,
i
will
allude
to
some
other
aspects
of
these
proceedings
but
essentially
that's
the
timing
of
the
proceedings.
the
testimony
on
the
character
--
characteristics
and
the
impact
of
these
publications
was
unusually
comprehensive.
the
government
had
two
psychiatrists,
one
of
which
testified
by
stipulation
only
and
one
psychologist
plus
several
lay
witnesses
and
petitioner
had
one
psychiatrist
and
one
psychotherapist.
the
record
that
was
produced
by
these
witnesses
makes
it
clear
as
to
just
what
the
intended
and
actual
audience
of
these
publications
was.
the
record
for
example
contained
concessions
by
a
petitioner's
publisher.
i
should
point
out
he
was
not
a
witness,
but
evidence
that
he
had
admitted
that
they
were
designed
for
and
that
they
were
read
primarily
by
homosexual
males.
the
government
expert,
the
psycholo
--
the
psychiatrist
and
the
psychologist
testified
that
the
only
possible
explanation
for
these
magazines
considering
the
way
in
which
they
were
setup
was
a
purpose
to
appeal
to
homosexuals
and
they
testified
that
in
fact
the
primary
audience
within
their
experience
would
in
fact
be
male
homosexuals
plus
adolescents
with
some
homosexual
tendencies.
it
was
conceded
--
i
should
also
point
out
that
these
witnesses
--
these
expert
witnesses
also
testified
that
these
magazines
would
have
no
appeal
to
the
average
normal
man
and
more
particularly,
they
certainly
would
not
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
average
normal
man.
it
was
conceded
not
all
sides
offer
that
they
would
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
homosexuals
and
this,
i
say,
is
specifically
conceded
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
detail
concerning
the
testimony
of
the
psychiatrist
and
psychologist
concerning
the
significance
of
the
various
poses,
costumes,
props
and
arrangements
in
these
pictures.
we've
set
that
out
in
some
detail
at
pages
5
to
10
of
our
brief.
i
would,
however,
like
to
touch
briefly
upon
the
expert
testimony
concerning
the
impact
of
these
magazines
on
their
intended
audience.
it's
rather
unusual
in
an
obscenity
case
as
you
no
doubt
appreciate
for
there
to
be
any
sort
of
specific
evidence
as
to
the
effect
that
pornography
will
have
on
its
audience.
in
the
case
of
the
average
person,
they
just
has
not
been
establish
clearly
one
way
or
the
other
that
it
does
or
does
not
have
this
effect
or
that
and
therefore,
as
i
say
it's
particularly
noteworthy
that
psychiatrists
and
psychologists
were
willing
to
come
forward
and
testify
as
they
did
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
there
was
some
disagreement
on
this
--
in
this
record
and
i
--
i
will
advert
briefly
to
the
extent
of
that
--
that
disagreement.
now,
there
was
testimony
in
--
in
wi
--
in
light
of
which
all
of
these
facts
have
to
be
considered
that
homosexuals
do
have
less
adequate
control
over
their
reactions
than
do
the
normal
person.
the
government
witnesses
also
testified
that
these
magazines
could
very
well
stimulate
practicing
homosexuals
to
engage
in
overt
and
indeed
in
unlawful
homosexual
activities.
there
was
testimony
that
the
magazines
would
induce
adolescents
with
latent
homosexual
tendencies
to
become
fixed
in
a
pattern
of
homosexual
behavior
and
as
to
both
of
these
categories
that
is
to
say
adult
male
homosexuals
and
adolescents
with
homosexual
tendencies.
the
testimony
was
that
the
reaction
of
these
magazines
would
arouse
in
them
would
make
it
more
difficult
to
treat
and
to
cure
them.
now,
the
--
there
was
not
a
significant
difference
of
expert
opinion
on
this
--
on
these
various
points
to
the
extent
that
the
defense
psychiatrist
and
psychologist
testified,
i
shouldn't
say
defense,
the
petitioner's
psychiatrist
and
psychologist
testified.
they
merely
said
that
magazines
of
this
character
could
not
turn
one
who
had
no
homosexual
tendencies
into
a
homosexual.
they
also
said
that
by
and
large
pictures
do
not
have
a
great
effect
on
most
homosexuals
although,
they
admitted
that
to
the
extent
that
a
homosexual
is
subject
to
any
stress
or
that
--
that
he
is
unable
to
get
any
relief
from
--
from
his
drives
that
then
they
might
have
some
effect
on
him.
here
again,
we've
endeavored
to
set
out
the
divergence
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
of
this
testimony
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
there
was
not,
the
--
this
testimony
that
i
referred
to
is
not
specifically
attacked
by
the
petitioner's
experts.
the
government's
expert
also
testified
that
the
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
homosexuals
was
the
dominant
theme
of
these
magazines.
indeed,
one
of
them
testified
that
this
was
the
only
theme
of
these
magazines
and
once
one
understands
and
appreciates
the
significance
of
the
various
costumes
and
poses
and
props
in
these
pictures,
this
conclusion
is
fairly
obvious
just
from
looking
at
the
magazines.
the
government
experts
further
testified
that
these
magazines
had
no
redeeming
qualities
of
any
kind.
for
example,
they
were
unable
to
find
any
sort
of
intention
to
express
ideas
or
to
advocate
a
point
of
view
such
as
it's
apparently
the
controlling
consideration
in
this
court's
decision
in
one
incorporated
against
olesen
and
sunshine
publications
against
summerfield.
now,
the
petitioner
has
contended
in
--
in
this
connection
of
redeeming
qualities
that
these
magazine
are
--
magazines
are
physical
culture
magazines.
as
i've
indicated
at
least
one
commentator
has
characterized
them
as
pseudo-physical
culture
magazines
and
i
think
it's
relevant
to
notice
the
american
law
institute
comment
in
the
model
penal
code
that
appeals
to
prurient
interest
should
not
escape
condemnation
merely
because
they
circulate
onto
the
banner
of
some
cult.
but
in
point
of
fact,
again
an
examination
of
these
publications
will,
i
think,
fairly
clearly
demonstrate
that
there
is
very
little
about
them
that
suggests
physical
culture.
one
particular
examper
--
example
i
would
cite
is
that
the
advertisements
that
appear
in
this
magazine
are
invariably
for
photographs
of
males.
they
--
they
don't
in
any
instance
advertise
physical
culture
equipment
or
weightlifting
equipment
or
books
as
to
how
to
improve
your
body.
the
government
experts
specifically
denied
that
these
were
physical
culture
magazines
in
their
dominant
theme
and
even
the
petitioner's
experts
testified
as
to
the
marked
and
critical
differences
between
these
publications
and
what
we
might
recall
to
have
been
--
wha
--
what
we
might
have
expected
the
publications
of
the
charles'
atlas
and
the
bernarr
macfadden's.
for
example,
they
noted
that
these
magazines
were
notably
lacking
in
--in
text
material
contrary
to
these
magazines
of
the
past
that
--
and
they
noted
as
--
as
a
very
critical
distic
--
distinction,
the
bizarreness
and
the
fact
that
some
of
these
would
be
wearing
only
shoes
and
that
sort
of
--
that
sort
of
thing.
they
noted
the
general
poor
taste
of
the
pictures
that
they
say
would
not
probably
be
found
in
the
traditional
physical
culture
magazines.
they
also
pointed
to
something
which
is
fairly
unavoidable,
if
you
examine
the
magazines,
and
that
is
that
the
great
many
of
the
models
that
appear
have
very
undistinguished
physiques.
on
the
basis
of
this
testimony
taken
as
a
whole,
the
judicial
officer
of
the
post
office
department
found
that
the
dominant
theme
of
the
magazines
was
an
appeal
to
the
prurient
interests
of
the
actual
and
intended
audience
of
these
publications,
namely
male
homosexuals
and
adolescents
with
homosexual
tendencies
and
that
they
were
therefore
obscene
and
non-mailable
and
the
court's
below,
they
both
agreed.
now,
this
finding
and
its
approval
by
the
courts
below,
of
course,
assumed
that
obscenity
is
properly
judged
in
relation
to
the
average
member
of
the
audience
of
the
publication
and
not
the
average
person
in
the
community.
and
we
submit
that
this
was
clearly
correct.
indeed,
that
this
is
the
only
test
that
is
possible
at
the
legislative
ends
of
congress
in
enacting
this
legislation
and
of
the
states
generally
in
enacting
obscenity
legislation,
are
to
be
upheld.
it
is
almost
universally
recognized
that
the
primary
purpose
of
obscenity
legislation
is
to
ban
material
that
may
lead
directly
or
indirectly
to
illegal
or
immoral
conduct.
now,
it
seems
plain
that
if
we
are
to
be
concerned
with
the
effect
that
this
sort
of
material
is
to
have
on
conduct,
we
must
consider
those
who
are
exposed
to
it
and
hence
maybe
affected
by
it,
not
to
some
group
that
will
not
come
in
contact
with
it
at
all.
the
testimony
in
this
case
is,
as
i
have
indicated,
that
homosexuals
will
see
and
will
be
affected
by
this
material
whereas
the
average
normal
person
by
and
large
simply
won't
buy
it.
i
should
like
the
court
to
consider
the
anomaly
of
applying
the
average
normal
adult
standard
to
all
material
irrespective
of
its
audience.
under
the
average
normal
adult
standard
that
petitioners
are
contending
for,
pornographic
matter
appealing
to
the
prurient
interest
of
normal
adults
can
be
kept
from
them
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
in
relation
to
abnormal
people,
they
have
better
defenses
against
being
affected
by
this
sort
of
thing
and
furthermore
as
a
general
rule
or
i
should
say
more
often
than
not
they
have
a
lawful
outlet
for
any
desires
that
are
stimulated
by
this
material
or
at
least
they
have
an
outlet
that
is
less
socially
condemned.
however,
under
the
same
average
normal
adult
standard,
pornographic
matter
deemed
that's
--
at
the
special
tastes
and
interests
of
sexual
deviants
or
of
adolescents
cannot
be
controlled
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
is
the
evidence
in
this
case,
indicated
they
are
more
likely
to
be
affected
by
it.
they
have
a
lower
threshold
as
far
as
the
effect
on
them
is
concerned
and
that
they
do
not
by
and
large
have
as
much
of
an
available
outlet
for
any
--
any
desires
that
maybe
stimulated.
thus,
those
most
in
need
of
protection
against
the
pornography
of
the
panders
of
pornography
would
be
denied
it.
i
suggest
quite
the
contrary
of
what
mr.
dietz
suggested
--
in
suggesting
that
homosexuals
are
made
second
class
citizens.
there
is
an
analysis
that
i've
gone
through,
it
suggest
that
the
average
normal
adult
would
be
made
second
class
citizen
since
he
could
be
kept
from
pornography,
but
the
homosexual
could
not.
now,
i
do
want
to
cover
one
point
and
that
is
that
the
adoption
of
the
standard
would
certainly
not
be
an
adoption
of
the
hicklin
test
where
all
material
is
to
be
judged
by
its
effect
on
the
most
susceptible
person.
we're
talking
here
about
material
that
is
aimed
at
a
special
audience,
that
is
read
by
a
special
audience
in
matter,
that
this
directed
to
the
average
audience
as
most
material
is
and
would
of
course
be
judged
accordingly.
in
view
of
this
consideration,
most
of
the
enlighten
commentators
of
today
have
urged
that
the
--
that
pornography,
that
obscenity
be
judged
in
terms
of
its
audience.
and
i
will
cite
we've
referred
to
in
our
brief
simply
the
american
law
institute's
model
penal
code,
lockhart
and
mcclure,
who
are
recognized
as
the
leading
authorities
in
this
country
on
obscenity
and
the
law
and
in
addition,
the
english
and
their
obscene
publications
act
of
1959
also
adopted
this
standard
at
the
urging
of
lea
--
leading
literary
fi
--
figures
in
england.
we
submit
further
that
this
standard,
judging
material
in
relation
to
its
audience,
is
entirely
consistent
with
what
this
court
laid
down
as
the
definition
of
obscenity
in
the
roth
case.
it's
significant
to
note
the
trial
court
charge
in
roth,
which
was
approved
by
this
court,
was
articulated
in
terms
of
the
effect
upon
all
those
whom
it
is
likely
to
reach.
and
of
course,
in
the
roth
case,
there
was
no
contention
that
this
--
the
material
in
that
case
was
aimed
at
anything
but
the
general
public
and
therefore,
this
didn't
create
any
sort
of
stir
but
as
i
say
that
was
in
the
roth
charge
and
in
addition,
in
many
of
the
cases
cited
by
this
court
in
roth,
the
standard
of
the
audience
to
which
the
publication
--
to
which
the
material
was
directed
was
the
standard
used
by
the
court
that
we've
set
out
in
our
brief
in
page
30
that
some
of
those
cases
and
the
language
that
the
courts
used
in
employing
that
standard.
i
think
one
further
point
that
is
rather
important
in
judging
the
audience
standard
is
that
it
has
been
rather
persuasively
argued
that
the
adoption
of
an
audience
standard
as
oppose
to
an
average
adult
standard
is
perhaps
the
key
to
intelligent,
liberal
and
effective
judging
of
obscenity.
this
is
strongly
urged
by
lockhart
and
mcclure.
they
point
out,
for
example,
that
such
standard
would
tend
to
protect
works
of
some
literary
narrative
such
as
for
example,
lady
chatterley's
lover
for
magazines
of
some
literary
merit
or
ordinarily
deemed
and
consumed
primarily
by
people
somewhat
more
sophisticated
than
the
average
normal
adult.
on
the
other
hand,
employment
of
this
standard
does
leave
open
the
possibility
of
proceeding
against
the
pander
who
goes
into
the
schoolyard
to
purvey
these
very
same
books
to
young
children
in
order
to
stimulate
their
sexual
interest.
in
short,
we
strongly
urge
that
where
the
evidence
shows
the
material
was
designed
primarily
for
and
consumed
primarily
by
a
special
audience,
its
obscenity
must
be
judged
in
relation
to
that
audience
and
we
further
urge
that
in
this
case,
the
judicial
officer
and
the
courts
below
properly
employed
that
standard
in
concluding
that
this
material
was
non-mailable.
now,
if
the
court's
indulgence
in
order
to
make
sure
that
i
covered
the
prior
restraint
point,
i
shall
not
argue
the
second
point
in
our
brief
and
it's
also
the
second
point
in
the
petitioner's
brief
concerning
the
second
and
independent
basis
for
concluding
that
this
material
is
non-mailable
and
that
is,
that
it
contained
information
as
to
where
obscene
material
could
be
obtained
that
is,
it
primarily
turns
on
the
facts
in
both
of
the
brief
we've
set
out
the
fact
in
detail
and
i
don't
think
that
anything
would
be
gained
by
argument
on
the
point
here.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
the
--
this
material
here
at
court
you
mean?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes
it
is.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that's
right.
it
relates
to
material
that
could
be
obtained
from
the
advertisers.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
part
of
it
was.
part
--
pictures
of
nude
males,
completely
nude,
undraped
males
were
obtained
through
the
mails
from
some
of
these
advertisers
by
postal
inspectors
and
also
by
one
private
citizen
who
testified
at
the
hearing.
beyond
that,
what
the
hearing
officer
--
the
judicial
officer
characterized
as
hardcore
pornography
an
extremely
gross
material
was
seized
in
local
police
raids,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
we
--
we
believe
and
we've
set
out
the
facts
on
the
basis
of
--
on
which
our
belief
is
founded
that
the
petitioners
plainly
had
knowledge
or
at
the
very
least
were
chargeable
with
knowledge
of
what
their
advertisers
were
putting
out.
in
the
first
place,
they
represent
in
three
or
four
of
these
magazines.
they
represent
familiarity
with
the
work
of
their
advertisers
and
urge
the
various
subscribers
to
the
magazine
to
send
their
money
into
these
photographers
for
pictures.
secondly,
the
record
is
replete
with
evidence
of
the
involvement
of
petitioner's
publisher
with
purveyors
of
homose
--
of
--
obscenity
among
homosexuals
including
his
offer
to
exchange
what
he
calls
sucker
lists
among
the
various
other
photographic
studios,
indeed
his
own
conviction
for
sending
obscenity
through
the
mails
such
that
it
--
it
defies
credulity
that
he
was
not
aware
of
what
these
various
studios
were
doing.
furthermore,
he
was
warned
a
number
of
times
that
the
possibility
that
the
material
--
that
his
advertisers
were
sending
obscene
materials
through
the
mail
and
finally,
we
suggest
that
if
you
just
examine
these
advertisements
themselves,
you'll
see
that
they
rather
strongly
indicate
that
obscene
material
could
be
obtained
just
to
suggest
one
example,
one
of
the
pictures
has
a
--
one
of
the
magazines
in
the
advertisements
has
a
picture
of
a
young
boy
with
the
parts
of
the
picture
that
would
render
it
objectionable,
very
obviously
retouched,
very
obviously
removed
and
then
the
text
below
the
picture
offers
“an
original
print
of
this
photo”
and
is
rather
clear
of
what
the
advertiser
had
in
mind
in
making
that
particular
offer.
a
contention
is
made
and
i
shall
devote
the
remainder
of
my
argument
to
it
that
the
procedures
followed
by
the
post
office
department
constitute
a
prior
restraint
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
in
that
the
postmaster
general
refused
to
carry
these
matters
--
these
magazines
pending
a
determination
of
their
mailability.
after
very
briefly
going
through
the
procedure
that
was
followed,
i
will
argue
that
the
procedure
here
was
required
by
congress
and
that
it
is
not
barred
by
the
constitution.
the
procedures
are
set
forth
at
the
back
of
our
brief
and
i've
already
indicated
to
some
extent
what
they
consist
of.
i
would
like
to
add
that
in
this
case,
a
slight
variation
in
the
procedures
was
agreed
upon
by
stipulation
in
order
that
they
be
expedited
and
i
might
say
that
the
pro
--
that
the
regulations
which
do
require
expedition
at
each
stage
of
the
proceedings
expressly
provide
for
waiver
of
any
part
of
the
procedure
in
order
that
they
be
moved
along
and
here,
by
stipulation,
the
--
a
hearing
before
a
hearing
examiner
was
waived.
ordinarily,
there's
a
hearing
before
a
hearing
examiner
and
then
this
is
final
unless
it
appealed
to
the
judicial
officer.
here
by
stipulation,
the
hear
--
the
hearing
was
originally
held
before
the
judicial
officer
so
that
one
stage
of
the
proceedings
was
eliminated
in
order
to
complete
the
proceeding
as
quickly
as
possible.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
no,
i
certainly
would
not
say
that's
the
only
basis
for
it.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that's
--
well,
there
is
--
there
actually
there
is
other
statutory
basis
for
it.
it
--
it
is
a
consideration
of
a
number
of
statutes
taken
together.
the
other
statute
i
would
cite
to
you
in
that
regard
is
set
forth
on
page
61
of
our
brief
where
it's
provided
that
non-mailable
matter
which
reaches
the
opposite
devi
--
delivery
shall
be
disposed
off
as
the
postmaster
general
directs
indicating,
at
we
think
quite
directly
that
congress
intended
that
such
matter
be
removed
from
the
mail.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin
my
argument
this
morning,
i
should
like
briefly
to
clarify
the
circumstances
chronologically
concerning
the
initi
--
initiation
of
these
mailability
proceedings,
particularly
in
response
to
questions
yesterday
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
justice
brennan.
since
these
facts
are
not
in
the
record
and
since
i'm
not
sure
that
they're
completely
clear,
i
do
want
to
make
sure
that
there's
no
confusion
with
respect
to
them.
now,
you
recall
as
pointed
out
yesterday
that
the
general
counsel
of
the
post
office
originally
informed
the
mailer,
in
this
case,
petitioner,
that
in
his
opinion,
the
matter
was
nonmailable
and
also
that
it
was
not
of
sufficient
value
to
warrant
a
hearing.
now
on
the
11th
of
april,
the
mailer
appealed
this
decision
to
the
judicial
officer
of
the
post
office
department
according
to
regulations,
informing
him
that
the
magazines
that
actually
been
deposited
in
the
mail
were
not
the
only
thing
at
issue.
these
were
only
part
of
the
issue
of
the
magazines
and
that
therefore
there
were
great
many
more
that
would
be
affected
by
a
determination
of
nonmailability
and
on
the
basss
of
that
representation,
the
judicial
office
held
they
were
sufficient
value
to
warranty
hearing.
and
he
made
that
decision
on
the
same
day,
april
11th
and
it
was
also
on
that
same
day
that
mailer
when
into
district
court
and
got
ex
parte,
a
temporary
restraining
order,
so
that
these
things
all
happened
on
--
on
the
same
day.
and
then
it
was
on
the
morning
of
april
12,
the
following
day,
the
government
went
in
and
had
this
temporary
restraining
order
stayed
in
order
that
they
might
respond
and
eventually,
argument
was
held
and
the
complaint
was
dismissed
without
prejudice
to
petitioner's
going
back
in
if
the
administrator
proceedings
were
not
completed
by
a
date
certain.
now,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there
is
no
basis
at
all
in
this
record
for
the
suggestion
that
the
mailer,
the
petitioner
here,
in
anyway
force
the
post
office
department
to
hold
a
hearing.
the
post
office
regulations
provide
for
a
hearing,
procedures
prescribed
in
those
regulations
were
followed
in
every
respect
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
the
mailing
was
actually
the
25th
of
march.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
the
--
these
proceedings
did
go
and
did
go
along
in
their
normal
course
in
this
case
and
neither
before
the
post
office
nor
in
the
courts
below
did
this
petitioner
ever
contend
that
there
was
any
procedural
defect
or
irregularity
of
any
kind.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
quite
so
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
the
record
doesn't
reflect
that.
frankly,
i
can't
state
certainly
that
the
judicial
officer
was
unaware.
now
as
i
say,
the
temporary
restraining
order
which
was
obtained
on
the
11th
of
april
was
obtained
ex
parte
and
the
representations
that
mailer
made
in
his
request
for
a
hearing
did
contribute
knowledge
to
judicial
officer
that
would
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
indeed.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
precisely
so
mr.
justice,
precisely
so.
now,
i
should
like
to
argue
it
first
that
procedures
employed
by
the
post
office
department
were
required
by
congress,
and
secondly
that
they
did
not
constitute
an
unconstitutional
prior
restraint.
in
1921,
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
milwaukee
publishing
company
against
burleson,
mr.
justice
brandeis
made
this
statement.
as
a
matter
of
the
administration,
the
postmaster
general
through
his
subordinates
rejects
matter
offered
for
mailing
or
removes
matter
already
in
the
mail
which
in
his
judgment
is
unmailable.
the
existence
in
the
postmaster
general
of
the
power
to
do
this
cannot
be
doubted
and
we
submit
that
that
statement
is
as
valid
today
that
it
was
40
years
ago
when
mr.
justice
brandeis
made
it.
the
18
u.s.c.
1461,
which
was
first
enacted
in
1865,
unequivocally
declares
that
obscenity
and
i
quote,
is
declared
to
be
nonmailable
matter
and
shall
not
be
convey
in
the
mails
or
deliver
it
from
any
post
office
or
by
any
letter
carrier.
it
seems
to
me
clear
from
the
face
of
the
statute
as
well
as
from
the
legislative
history
which
we
have
set
forth
on
pages
59
to
61
of
our
brief.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well
that's
not
the
language
as
it
originally
appeared.
that's
the
language
at
the
present
and
as
far
--
as
of
the
time
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
am
frankly
not
certain
that
it
was
identical.
the
original
language
was
very
close.
it
merely
said
that
this
matter
is
nonmailabe
and
shall
not
be
admitted
to
mails.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
there
was
--
there
was
not
a
statute
in
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that
is
right.
the
statute
was
not
significantly
different
at
that
time.
in
fact,
it
has
not
been
significantly
different
at
any
stage
of
its
history.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that's
right
mr.
justice
although
as
this
statute
was
originally
enacted,
it
was
enacted
as
one
section
of
a
postal
law.
it
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
do
not
know
frankly
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
but
as
i
say,
as
--
as
enacted,
it
was
a
part
of
a
general
postal
law
and
the
revisers
of
course
put
it
in
the
code.
i
--
it's
pointed
out
to
me
that
that
in
fact
this
statute
also
appears
primarily
by
reference
in
39
u.s.c.
there
is
a
general
provisions
stating
that
the
various
items
that
are
declared
nonmailable
by
the
various
provisions
in
18
u.s.c.
are
declared
to
be
nonmailable.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes
it
does
appear
in
our
brief.
we
suggest
too
that
this
power
is
confirmed
by
various
other
legislations
such
as
section
39
u.s.c.
4001,
which
i've
already
referred
to.
now,
4001
(a)
is
the
provision
that
declares
that
various
items
will
be
nonmailable
and
then
4001
(b)
provides
that
mail
that
is
not
refused
by
the
post
--
local
post
office
when
it
is
offered,
but
managed
to
reach
the
offer
--
office
of
delivery
shall
be
disposed
of
as
the
postmaster
general
shall
direct.
now,
furthermore,
this
provision
is
part
if
comprehensives
scheme
in
which
a
variety
of
matters,
all
of
which
is
referred
to
in
section
4001
(a)
by
reference
and
including
such
items
as
explosives
and
disease
germs,
are
declare
to
be
nonmailable
matter
and
precisely
the
same
language.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
the
items
are
referred
to
were
--
in
18
u.s.c.
1760,
sections
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
sir?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
18
u.s.c.
17
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
there
--
there
are
--
there
is
a
specific
provision
on
fraudulent
material
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
in
--
in
the
same
terms
of
this
statute
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
in
no
more
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
in
no
more
terms
than
this.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
in
no
more
terms
than
this
statute
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
by
saying
the
postmaster
general
must
be
give.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
we
suggest
it's
a
little
stronger
than
just
nonmailable.
the
statute
says
it
shall
not
be
conveyed
in
the
mails,
and
shall
not
be
delivered
from
any
post
office.
we
feel
that
that
is
clearly
a
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that
it
has
been
and
as
far
as
we
know,
it's
never
been
challenged.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
know
of
no
qualification
made
by
any
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
--
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well
mr.
justice
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
mr.
justice
douglas
--
of
course,
there
had
been
qualifications
in
the
area
of
granting
or
denying,
second
class
mailing
privileges,
but
of
course
that's
an
entirely
different
question.
as
you
may
recall
from
the
hannegan
case
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
--
there
you
were
dealing
with
something
that
was
conceded
to
be
mailable
under
these
provisions,
conceded
to
be
mailable
under
the
--
the
nonmailability
provisions,
but
in
spite
of
that
fact,
a
second
class
mailing
privilege
was
denied
and
this
court
speaking
through
your
opinion
said
that
could
not
be
done.
now,
we
submit
that
if
the
post
office
authorities
are
thus
require
to
exclude
obscenity
from
the
mails,
it
must
also
follow
that
they
must
refuse
to
carry
questionable
matter
pending
a
determines
--
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
mailable
because
the
time
required
for
the
transmission
of
mail
is
always
going
to
be
less
than
the
time
within
which
a
full
and
fair
hearing
with
adequate
notice
can
be
conducted
and
if
the
material
must
be
allowed
that
can
be
conducted
in
the
mails
during
this
hearing,
the
proceedings
to
determine
mailability
would
variably
become
moot
and
the
post
office
would
be
without
any
power
whatsoever
to
enforce
this
congressional
declaration
of
nonmailability.
it
would
also
be
required
not
only
to
violate
this
requirement
of
congress,
but
also
to
a
--
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
of
conducting
of
sending
obscene
matter
through
the
mails.
and
now,
in
addition
it
has
always,
always
been
the
consistent
practice
of
the
post
office
department
to
refuse
to
carry
matter
deemed
to
be
obscene,
unless
and
until
it
was
authoritatively
determined
to
be
mailable
and
we've
set
forth
the
details
of
that
administrative
practice
in
our
brief
on
pages
63
and
64
and
this
has
been
true
as
i
say
from
the
very
outset.
this
longstanding
interpretation,
developed
by
those
who
were
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
administering
this
law
and
then
in
--
interpretation
which
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
congress
has
been
made
fully
aware
of,
we
submit
would
be
entitled
the
great
weight
even
if
the
statute
were
as
clear
on
its
face
and
in
its
history
as
this
one
is.
and
we
submit
that
in
view
of
the
wording,
the
history
and
the
context
of
18
u.s.c.
1461
and
of
post
office
department's
consistent
and
longstanding
administrative
interpretation
of
it,
there
can
be
no
serious
question
of
the
post
office
--
of
the
postmaster
general's
authority
to
refuse
to
carry
matter
deemed
obscene
pending
a
determination
as
to
whether
it
is
obscene
or
not.
i
might
add
that
over
the
years.
in
a
long
serious
of
case
--
cases
beginning
with
ex
parte
jackson
in
1877,
this
court
has
made
clear
it
manifest
assumption
that
the
postmaster
general
did
have
this
power.
mr.
justice
brandeis'
statement
albeit
in
dissenting
opinion,
was
but
one
instance
of
--
of
many
and
which
this
court
has
indicated
its
assumption
on
that
point.
we've
set
forth
this
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
that's
true.
that's
right
and
these
cases
we
have
set
forth
and
discussed
in
pages
75
to
79
of
our
brief.
now
on
the
point
prior
restraint,
the
contention
that
the
procedures
involved
in
this
case,
did
involve
a
prior
restraint
go
to
fact
that
as
i've
indicated
the
postmaster
general
refuses
to
carry
matter
deemed,
obscene
pending
a
determination
of
its
mailability,
we
submit
that
this
contention
is
wholly
without
merit.
in
the
first
place,
this
procedure
does
not
have
prior
impact
within
the
meaning
of
the
prior
restraint
doctrine,
and
this
is
principally
for
the
reason
that
it
operates
not
prior
to
publication
of
the
material
in
question,
but
only
after
it
has
been
printed
and
offered
to
the
public.
there
is
nothing
under
this
procedure
that
need
be
submitted
to
the
authorities
in
advance.
the
onus
is
on
the
postal
officials
to
initiate
any
action
that
is
to
be
taken
and
the
administrative
determination
involved
in
these
cases
has
no
future
effect.
it
covers
only
the
material
that
has
already
been
published,
deposited
in
the
mails
and
then
determined
to
be
obscene.
thus,
the
procedure
employed
in
these
cases
is
wholly
free
from
the
vices
that
caused
this
court
condemned
the
procedures,
for
example
that
were
issue
in
near
against
minnesota
as
prior
restraint.
in
the
second
place,
we
submit
that
this
procedure
does
not
work
really
a
fully
effective
restraint
within
the
meaning
of
the
cases
this
court
has
decided.
in
kingsley
books
against
brown
in
354
us,
the
court
upheld
does
not
involving
a
prior
restraint
an
injunction
against
the
sale
and
distribution
of
allegedly
obscene
matter
pending
a
determination
of
its
obscenity.
now,
the
restraint
involved
in
these
cases
of
course
far
less
severe.
it
may
--
it
--
the
allegedly
obscene
matter
in
this
case
is
merely
denied
the
use
of
the
mails
pending
that
determination.
the
mailer
is
free
to
sale
and
distributes
this
material
in
any
other
way
he's
able
to
do
free
and
i
suggest
this
is
important,
free
from
the
possibility
to
hazard
to
contempt
prosecution
and
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
the
feasibility
of
this
alternative
is
really
quite
clear.
these
magazines
as
the
record
indicates
are
not
by
and
large
are
sent
through
the
mails
to
individual
subscribers.
they
are
largely
sent
in
bulk
to
news
dealers
who
then
sell
them
on
newsstands
and
it
would
seem
that
they
could
very
easily
be
shipped
by
express
or
some
other
type
of
carrier.
now,
we
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
essentially,
that's
true
mr.
justice.
we
--
we
do
not
content
that
(voice
overlap)
to
the
average
man.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
they
were
somewhat
offensive
on
their
face.
whether
or
not,
they
could
be
said
on
their
face
to
be
obscene,
i
don't
know.
but
i
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
then
--
the
pictures
that
were
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
oh,
quite
so.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
sir
of
course.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
now,
we
certainly
recognized
that
there
is
some
measure
of
restraint
involved
in
denying
the
use
of
the
mails
to
this
mater
--
material
pending
a
determination
of
its
obscenity,
but
we
submit
that
to
the
extent
at
these
procedures
do
involve
some
restraint
on
the
publisher.
they
are
surrounded
by
sufficient
procedural
safeguards
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
free
flow
of
constitutionally
protected
non-obscene
matter.
the
guidelines
to
be
applied
in
attempting
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
is
so
had
been
largely
spelled
out
by
this
court,
by
the
contrast
between
marcus
against
search
warrants
in
367
us
and
the
kingsley
books
case
that
i
have
discussed.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
in
kingsley,
the
procedures
there
were
being
balanced
against
and
injunction
against
sell
and
distribution.
in
marcus,
there
were
being
balanced
against
complete
seizure
of
the
materials,
here
against
refusal
to
carry
in
the
mail.
we
submit
that
while
the
fact
that
some
restraint
is
involved
does
necessitate
some
safeguards,
the
facts
that
it
is
only
refusal
to
carry
in
the
mails
does
there
significantly
on
what
will
constitute
reasonable
safeguards
in
this
instance.
now,
the
post
office
procedures
in
this
case
suffer
from
none
of
the
critical
defects
that
the
court
identified
in
the
procedures
in
the
marcus
case.
in
marcus,
the
proceedings
were
instituted
on
the
basis
of
conclusory
assertions
of
a
single
policeman.
here,
the
questionable
matter
is
initially
pass
on
by
a
local
postmaster
and
then
by
legally
trained
senior
administrative
official,
fully
schooled
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
a
lower
courts
in
the
law
of
obscenity,
before
any
mailability
action
is
instituted.
in
marcus,
there
was
no
identification
of
the
specific
matter
being
proceeded
against.
here
of
course,
the
material
that
was
at
was
an
issue
was
identified
fully
and
completely
from
beginning
to
end
and
there
was
not
possibility
of
the
findings
going
beyond
the
material
that
actually
was
in
issue.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
beyond
psychiatrists
and
psychologists
i
know
of
no
other
body
of
--
of
experts
in
determining
these
particular
facts.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
they
have
their
own
body
of
expert
on
this,
no.
you
mean
among
psychiatrists
and
psychologists?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
would
not
suppose
on
what
is
obscene.
the
fbi
might
be
called
upon
in
an
individual
case
as
having
developed
facts
on
investigation,
but,
in
point
of
fact
most
of
the
facts
that
are
necessary
to
be
established
in
this
sort
of
case
are
established
by
postal
inspectors
in
point
of
fact
in
this
case,
there
was
the
testimony
of
one
postal
--
live
postal
inspector
and
then
also
some
stipulated
testimony
of
other
postal
inspectors.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
a
search
warrant,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
without
any
expert
testimony
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
must
say
it
would
be
rather
difficult.
perhaps
a
group
of
the
audience
to
which
these
magazines
were
directed
could
be
brought
in
to
testify
on
what
--
what
standards
might
be
appropriate
and
what
effect
these
things
might
have,
but
the
difficulties
of
that
are
obvious
and
certainly,
the
experts'
testimony
was
extremely
important
in
--
in
developing
the
record
that
was
developed
here.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
in
this
particular
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
fraudulent
material,
material
inciting
to
treason,
rebellion.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well
not
--
i
wouldn't
suggest
not
what
it
meant
mr.
justice,
perhaps
something
that
didn't
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
can
well
imagine
the
case
in
which
that
would
be
appropriated
sir,
that
that
--
a
part
--
particular
kinds
of
incitations
might
be
more
significant
when
directed
towrads
certain
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes
sir.
that's
what
it
is.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
as
i
say,
i
can
imagine
the
case
in
which
that
--
in
which
that
would
be
appropriate,
certainly
not
in
a
typically
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
development
of
this
in
the
courts
generally
has
taken
place
over
the
last
25
or
30
years
as
--
as
any
kind
of
documents
has
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
it's
not
a
question
of
experts
on
obscenity.
it's
experts
on
the
effects
that
particular
material
might
have
on
people.
i
don't
think
it's
ever
been
in
case
and
it
certainly
it
was
not
case
here
that
the
psychiatrists
or
psychologists
said,this
material
is
obscene.
they
--
they
explained
to
the
judicial
officer
who
is
charged
with
making
that
decision
what
the
effects
of
these
items
would
be.
they
didn't
(voice
overlap)
they
didn't
arrive
at
any
conclusion
on
the
subject.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
exactly
the
sort
of
case
in
which
that
testimony
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
in
essence
i
think
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
think
that's
right
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well
once
again
i
--
i
emphasize
that
they
themselves
are
not
making
this
decision.
they
merely
providing
the
finders
of
fact
in
pointers
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
on
--
on
the
basis
of
which
he
can
achieve
a
ration
result
i
would
say.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it's
necessary
for
this
court
to
look
very
closely
at
the
decisions
that
are
made.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no,
i
should
say
not.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
--
indeed
this
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
this
--
these
particular
experts
were
specially
qualified
in
dealing
with
homosexuals
and
persons
of
--
with
homosexual
tendencies
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
of
course,
they
are.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
indeed
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
in
any
determination,
in
any
court
proceeding
where
the
trier
must
affect
human
rights
on
the
basis
of
testimony,
on
the
basis
of
evidence,
he
is
going
to
have
to
have
a
little
bit
of
help
in
determining
to
--
determining
exactly
what
the
facts
are
in
case
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well
that's
--
that's
the
conclusion
that
he
must
make
in
that
case.
in
this
case,
the
trier
must
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
matter
is
obscene
or
not
obscene
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
--
and
there
are
two
that
need
some
help.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
that's
the
first
level
of
determination.
of
course
from
that,
it
must
follow
that
the
material
is
either
obscene
or
not
obscene.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
the
trier
here
very
much
needs
some
help
and
it
would
be
--
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
oh
i
suggest
that
it
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
oh
i
suggest
in
a
great
many
cases,
perhaps
even
in
the
bulk
of
cases,
this
will
not
be
necessary.
as
i
pointed
out,
this
is
very
unusual
case
in
which
the
average
person
cannot
be
expected
to
appreciate
really
of
the
great
effect
to
this
kind
of
material
can
have
on
human
beings.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
were
we
stop
is
pretty
much
determined
by
the
standard
that
i've
argued
in
favor
of
and
that
is
we're
talking
about
material
that
is
beamed
to
a
particular
audience.
now,
i
suppose
that
if
it
can
be
established
that
material
that
would
be
inclined
to
stimulate
that
kind
person
was
being
intentionally
beamed
at
him
in
an
effort
to
stimulate
him,
maybe
a
good
case
will
be
made
out,
but
the
point
is,
we're
not
talking
again
about
the
regina
against
hicklin
notion
of
the
most
susceptible
person
in
the
community.
we're
talking
about
material
that
is
aimed,
that
is
beamed,
that
is
designed
for
a
particular
kind
of
person,
just
as
most
material
is
aimed,
beamed
and
designed
at
the
average
public
and
therefore,
maybe
judged
by
the
standard
to
be
average
public.
but
where
you've
got
something
that's
aimed
that
is
special
class,
such
as
the
deviates
in
this
case
or
to
children,
we
submit
that
then
it
must
be
judged
in
terms
of
those
people
at
whom
it
is
--
it
is
actually
aimed
and
by
whom
that
would
be
actually
read.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no
question
at
all.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that's
right.
the
perfect
example
is
the
--
is
the
so
called
kinsey
case
31
photog
--
the
united
states
against
31
photographs
which
we've
cited
in
brief,
where
some
unquestionably
hardcore
photography
was
brought
in
the
--
attempted
to
be
brought
in
to
this
country
by
the
institute
for
sex
research
that
so
called
kinsey
institute.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no,
no.
it's
certainly
is
not.
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
--
the
testimony
is
really
quite
extensive
as
to
the
purposes
to
which
the
institute
planned
to
use
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
he
has
that
right
mr.
justice
black
only
as
i've
tried
to
indicate
in
this
case
when
that
material
is
provably
being
beamed
or
aimed
at
a
particular
a
class,
he
can't
just
take
the
average
material
that's
being
sent
out
and
say
--
say,
i
think
this
is
going
to
hurt
little
children.
now,
this
has
been
clearly
established
by
this
court
that
he
cannot
do
that.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
these
particular
magazines
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
--
are
beamed
according
to
the
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well
this
were
--
as
the
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
these
were
sent
to
news
dealers.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
because
we
have
concessions
on
the
part
of
the
publishers
of
these
magazines.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
the
--
the
testimony
in
this
record
shows
that
the
publisher
of
these
magazines
admitted
to
postal
authority
that
these
magazines
were
beamed,
designed
primarily
for
homosexuals.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well
on
page
10
of
our
brief,
we
have
summarized
the
testimony
out.
the
specific
items
in
the
record
are
here
on
page
57.
this
is
a
postal
official
--
a
postal
inspector
testifying.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that's
right
and
can
you
state
what
that
comment
was?
he
was
substantially,
it
was
substantially
to
defect
that
as
adults,
we
don't
have
to
kid
each
other.
we
know
who
is
getting
these
magazines
and
pictures
of
the
type
that
he
was
then
selling.
did
he
say
you
--
he
knew
that
would
buying
it,
yes
and
did
he
say
who
they
would
be,
homosexuals.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
the
letter
which
appears
as
exhibit
g
and
in
this
record
is
at
--
where
is
that
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
doubted
very
much
it
would
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
suppose
i
would.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
know
what
the
physiatrists
and
psychologists
would
testify
on
that
point,
but
i
suspect
i
would
not
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
--
as
i
say
i
suspect
you're
quite
right
in
that
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
pardon
me.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
they're
males
in
--
in
particular
posses
and
particular
customs
and
particular
prost.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
the
letter
is
at
page
88
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
--
of
the
record
here,
that's
right
mr.
justice
and
the
materials
that
i've
presumed
you
are
referring
to
appears
more
particularly
on
page
89.
there
were
--
here
at
page
664
of
the
record
also
a
--
an
official
in
the
post
office
department
that
is
not
the
postal
inspector
that
i
was
referring
to
before
stated,
i
recall
clearly
referring
to
a
statement
made
by
the
publisher
he
said,
well,
let's
not
kid
ourselves.
we
know
who
is
buying
this
magazine
and
that
is
homosexuals,
but
when
i
made
the
suggestion
that
it
was
homosexuals
who
were
buying
it.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
find
that
my
time
has
expired.
