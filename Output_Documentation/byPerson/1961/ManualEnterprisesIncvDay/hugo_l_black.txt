justice
hugo
l.

may
i
ask
you
what
the
--
to
your
knowledge
has
been
any
other
evolving,
developing
class
of
experts
in
this
line
besides
psychiatrists?
justice
hugo
l.
black
anybody.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
fbi?
doesn't
it
have
some
experts
to
testify
on
this
field?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
other
class
of
materials
are
nonmailable
besides
those
described
as
filthy
and
indecent
and
so
forth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
any
field,
what
other
--
are
the
--
what
other
classes
of
literature
are
declared
to
be
nonmailabe?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
suppose
in
that
kind
of
case,
if
isn't
true
on
its
face,
you
could
use
the
fbi
as
experts
to
show
what
that
meant,
couldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
whom
--
to
whom
it
might
appeal,
which
class
of
the
individual
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
might
appeal
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
is
--
as
i
understand
it
then,
if
there's
some
kind
of
political
document
that
they
would
hold
nonmailable,
they
could
look
to
see
if
it
might
and
still
some
--
and
still
some
suppressive
desire
in
somebody
and
through
that
by
experts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
has
it
been
the
custom
to
relay
on
so
called
experts
as
to
whether
something
was
obscene
and
filthy,
rather
than
relay
on
the
document
itself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
experts
on
obscenity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
claims
the
judge
--
if
it's
a
judge
trying
the
case
that
although
it
doesn't
seem
obscene
to
him,
it
might
--
doesn't
seem
like
it
was
(inaudible)
any
wrong
desires
on
him
if
there
are
certainly
types
of
people
that
they
have
experts
no
it
might?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
given
by
expert?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
providing
a
basis
on
which
the
judge
can
rationalize
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
explaining
to
me
in
your
words
how
do
you
analogize
this
to
that
situation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
person
is
sane
or
insane?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
certain
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
there
are
certain
kinds
of
pictures
will
have
certain
effect
on
certain
kind
of
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
the
people
need
help
if
the
thing
is
so
bad,
it's
so
obscene,
it
so
nasty
and
so
filthy.
they
can't
look
at
and
tell
them.
do
we
have
to
have
censorship
against
them
to
have
every
kind
of
literature
tested
by
experts
to
see
how
is
going
to
effect
somebody
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
we
have
a
censor,
why
should
we
just
have
open
censor
without
rationalizing
it
in
that
fashion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
know
of
some
of
these
were
not
directed
to
college
professors
and
isn't
true
that
the
--
that
the
post
office
department
can
pick
out
who
shall
receive
certain
literature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
as
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
postmaster
has
the
right
to
decide
what
person
might
be
adversity
affected
by
some
picture
nor
some
writings
and
the
decline
to
deliver
that
the
--
that
person
because
of
that
fact
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what's
the
concession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
was
an
expert
on
the
inside
of
any
people's
brain,
wasn't
he?
justice

black
what
is
(inaudible)
we've
been
so
far

of

black
i
saw
one
reprinted
from
the
reader's
