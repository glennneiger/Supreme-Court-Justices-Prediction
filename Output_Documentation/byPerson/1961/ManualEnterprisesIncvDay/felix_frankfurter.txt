is
it
true,
is
it
concluded
to
harry
neither
return
it
for

at
the

it
was

isn't
that
right?
justice
felix

well,
if
there's
a
statute
(inaudible)?
justice
felix

so
you
think,
he's
denied
the

he
obscene,
let's
now
discuss
it,
so
(inaudible)
may
the

refuse
the

the

justice

but
--
justice

and
the

to
oppose
that

not
let

justice

are
you
challenging
his

do
that,
to

(voice

be
real
claim
--
your

that
this

exercised
the

and
construe
as
non-mailable
to
get
obscene
magazines
from

he
exceeded
the

--
the
right
to
exercise
that
power
because
it's
definitely
not
obscene,
is
that
what
this
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
good
point
but
on
the
general's
power
of
the

general
excludes
all
the

that
is
thought

if
it

and
that's
made

alright.
why
does

(inaudible)?
justice

i
don't
understand
that,
that's
my
problem,
why
not

justice

once
the

made

illegal
if
you

why
would

that

justice

was
it
a
contested

on
the

justice

but
it
presented
a
new
fact,
namely
that
there
was

justice

--
that
there
was
new
volume
of
magazines
unlike
the
actual
offering
that
had
been
made
and
which
had
been
held
at
--
justice

does
that
--
does
that
language
continue
to
the
--
justice

was
that
the
language
that
was
found
in
the
milwaukee
case?
justice
felix

that
(voice

at
the
time
the
milwaukee
case,
there
was
not
a
statute
which
in
terms
--
justice

--
anymore
that
there
is
today.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
file
to
which
mr.
justice
brandeis
referred
was
drawn
and
partly
as
an
implication
from
the
statute
as
the
matters
nonmailable
therefore,
it's
not
to
be
mailed
and
partly
also
from
the
powers
given
to
the
postmaster
general
to
make
regulations
to
be
effective.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
mr.
doolittle,
to
reflect
my
recollection
or
rather
inform
my
ignorance,
is
there
a
specific
statute
authorizing
the
postmaster
general
to
exclude
the
matters
used
to?
(inaudible)
to
use
the

or
--
scheme
to
defraud
or
--
justice

is
that
right?
justice

saying,
you
should
not
carry,
fraudulent
material?
justice

i

that

my
question
was,
is
there
in

(voice

--
justice
felix

(voice

justice
felix

(inaudible)
as
to
matter
promoting
fraudulent

is
there
in
terms.
justice
felix

i
--
i
don't
follow
that
in

term
for
a
hundred
years,
this
file
hasn't
been
challenged
from
the
second

from
the
postmaster
general,
but
it
has
never
been
given
to
him
in

by
government
--
or
by
in

i
mean
specifically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix

it's
all
drawn
from
the
fact
that
this
matter
is
mailable.
the
postmaster
general
be
engaged
carrying
mail,
doesn't
carry
nonmailable

justice

if
the
post

the

is
charged
with
carrying

if
matters
presented
that

for

purposes,
there
isn't

stronger,
there

then
he'd
be
told

he
shall
not

isn't
that
the
--
hasn't
that
been
the
law
for
a
hundred
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
qualification
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
qualification
is
that
in
specific
instances,
he
may
have
exceeded
his
power
because
of
the
nature
of
the
materials
or
because
acting
on
past
nonmailability,
he
excluded
future
presentation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
say
albeit
in
the
dissenting
opinion
a
fortiori.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
testimony
by
these
experts
any
different
than
the
testimony
that
these
same
experts
may
give
in
proceedings
for
the
commitment
of
--
of
these
people
for
medical
health?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

came
up
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
appropriate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
those
determinations
are
made
everyday
by
the
courts
all
over
the
united
states
--
justice

frankfurter
--
with
reference
of
those
issues,
on
this
kind
of
evidence
which
a
court
or
a
jury
may
reject.
justice
felix

but
if
a
man
would
admit
--
justice

are
these
just
men?
justice
felix

are
these
pictures
just

justice

i
know
there
are

are
they
just
males
in
sense
in
which
(voice

so
long
as
you
got

is
that
it?
justice

are
you
now
testifying
as
an
expert
--
justice
felix

--
well,
dr
womack
might
meant
when
he
said
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix

he's
a
lot
of
fun.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
it
say
he
has
a
lot
of
fun?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
he
meant,
that
he
was
baiting.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
you're
an
expert
on
the
inside
of
dr.
womack's
(inaudible),
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
felix

then
he
disclosed
it,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mind
disclose
it,
but
i
just
don't
want
to
find
that
expertise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
are
you
denying
that
he
said
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
--
denying
but
you
have
not
telling
us
what
was
really
inside
his
mind
when
he
said
that,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
a
wicked
thing
to
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

we
could
think
to
cross
examine
of
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
find
out
his
intention?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
why
is
that
a
lion's
den?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
now
saying
that
he
was
really
ironic
when
he
said
that,
that's
what
i
get
from
your
remark?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
asked
him
--
yes,
but
he
was
kidding
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
just
said
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
constantly
(inaudible)
him
with
inquires
or
with
the
declaratory
statements
that
this
is
directed
to
homosexual.
finally,
he
just
teased
them.
i
said
that
he
was
ironic
and
you
said
yes
if
that
the
way
that
you
should
just
to
kid
you,
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
not
concerned
what
the
government
agent
asked
him,
but
what
his
answers
were.
are
you
saying
that
when
he
said
yes,
that
directed
me,
that
he
was
fooling,
that
he
was
teasing,
that
he
was
ironic,
that
he
didn't
mean
that
he
meant
the
opposite,
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
he
did
mean
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
dietz,
let
me
get
back
to
the
purpose
that
got
you
on
your
feet
which
you
expressed,
the
purpose
that
you
expressed,
namely
you
said
you
want
it
follow
the
line
of
--
follow
questions
put
from
the
bench.
the
chief
justice
then
read
to
you
that
purported
to
be
a
statement
by
the
petitioner,
namely
that
this
was
beamed
to
use
the
phrase
you
have
used,
the
chief
justice's
question
was,
did
he
not
say
that?
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
was
for
the
statement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap).
there
was
the
statement
by
him
in
which
he
said
that
indeed
this
were
aimed
at
a
homosexual
market,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
then
under
took
to
explain
that
by
saying
that
he
was
really
faded
by
the
baited
people
or
whether
they
were
constantly
applied
then
with
question,
wasn't
this
directed
or
to
homosexual
matter
or
whatever
the
phrase
was.
and
as
you
said,
he
finally
--
he
finally
having
been
badgered,
he
finally
yielded
as
to
that
and
said,
yes,
that's
true.
then
you
started
to
explain
it
namely,
that
why
--
that
this
was
--
which
led
me
to
ask
you
was
the
ironic
and
you
didn't
care
for
that
adjective,
i
don't
blame.
i
didn't
try
put
it
in
the
vernacular
and
said
was
he
kidding,
didn't
he
mean
it.
did
he
mean
in
fact
that
opposite?
now,
we
have
back
there.
are
you
saying
now
that
he
did
mean
it
or
he
didn't
mean
it,
which
are
you
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
matter
of
common
human
experience
that
the
chances
of
something
that
we
believe
toward
which
we
direct
action
is
more
likely
to
be
connected
with
our
action
than
if
we
didn't
believe
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
that
mail
matter
is
written
in
sanskrit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
sanskrit
and
addressed
to
sanskrit
community
of
the
united

or
maybe
such
or
some
article
of
non-populous
foreign
tongue,
could
the
post

have
that
translated
into
english
suppose
there's
a
publication
in
some
(inaudible)
language
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
--
i'm
asking
you,
could
--
could
matter
written
in
a
foreign
non-english
tongue
to
be
translated
into
english
in
order
to
understand
what
it
means
considering
the
market
to
which
it
was
directed,
could
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
you
are
not
alone
in
that.
i'm
asking
you
the
constitution
of
the
laws
of
united
states
being
what
they
are
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
being
what
they
are
could
matter
in
a
foreign
language
be
translated
into
english
in
order
to
find
out
what
it
means
to
those,
to
whom
it
is
directed,
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
asking
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
--
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
say
no
because
you
think
nothing
can
be
excluded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
merely
because
in
the
foreign
language?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
reach
to
that
point.
i'm
asking
you
whether
they
could
find
out
what
the
--
what
the
--
what
the
figures
or
holographic
are
which
are
in
the
foreign
script.
could
it
translated
into
english,
could
it
be
translated?
but
if
you
don't
want
to
answer,
that's
alright
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
equipment
is
french,
suppose
a
lot
of
french
stuff
comes
in,
can
the
post
office
in
order
to
find
out
what
the
contents
are
have
the
french
translated
into
english?
well,
that
seems
to
be
too
difficult
a
question
i
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
had
a
restraining
--
you
had
a
restraining
order
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
therefore
frees
from
what
is
called
