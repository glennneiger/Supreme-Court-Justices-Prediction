justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me,
mr.
doolittle,
one
of
the
principals
here
is
womack,
isn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
he
involved
in
other
difficulties
with
obscene
material
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
while
where
all
of
these
difficulties
of
his
--
these
other
difficulties
they
come
to
light
about
the
time
of
this
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
might
--
might
be
some
connection
between
the
prior
parties
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
--
i'm
just
wondering
in
the
record
i
ci
--
you
just
said
nothing
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
of
these
magazines
might
not
have
escaped
any
notice
at
all
but
for
womack's
other
difficulties.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it
that
you
were
already
held
some
quantity,
did
you
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
we're
not
moving
to
the
mail.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
the
restraint
was
served
it
would
still
not
move
through
mails
and
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
understand
that
--that
material
was
seized
rather
than
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
how
do
we
know
that
the
audience
is
the
buyer
to
these
magazines
would
be
the
deviates?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
--
what
--
what
precisely
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
precisely
did
he
say
--
as
he
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
57
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
mr.
doolittle
that
in
fact
the
evidence
was
that
all
of
these
were
just
to
go
colleges,
you
wouldn't
be
here
with
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
would
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
don't
think
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
cannot
(inaudible)
to
go
colleges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
you
--
i
thought
what
you
really
argued
was
that
even
assuming
these
were
beamed
at
the
homosexual
market,
they
are
not
obscene
publications
within
the
law
of
definition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
part
of
you
--
now
that
was
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
what's
the
other
part
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
time
is
running
out.
i
frankly
don't
see
how
that's
only
different
to
the
proposition
i
just
posed.
