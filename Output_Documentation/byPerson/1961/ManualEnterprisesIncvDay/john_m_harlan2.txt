well
with
reference
to
--
justice
john
m.

what
is
the
price?
justice

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

yes.
justice
john

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
are
saying
i
gather
is
that
the
granting
of
a
hearing
here
was
not
the
result
of
the
injunction
that
was
normal
administrative
process.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
it's
just
a
circumstance
that
the
hearing
in
the
injunction
was
--
happened
on
the
same
day,
that's
you
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
question
at
this
point?
the
pictures
that
--
if
you
look
at
these
pictures,
look
at
the
magazines
on
their
face,
forget
this
very
testimony
for
a
moment
and
you
look
at
the
documents
that
i
asked
you
about
yesterday
that
were
obtained
from
other
purveyors
or
other
obscenely,
you
might
draw
a
different
conclusions
just
looking
at
those
documents
on
their
face
and
what
i
--
the
question
i
want
to
put
to
you
is
your
case
as
far
as
the
magazines
are
concerned
depends
basically,
does
it
not,
on
the
interpretation
which
these
psychiatrists
or
whatever
you
call,
and
gave
to
the
real
--
the
exposure
that
they
gave,
that
you
claim
they
gave
to
this
(inaudible)
these
documents
as
they
might
effect
this
unfortunate
class
of
people
in
the
community.

different
character
than
of
this
miscellaneous
picture
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
from
which
your
opponent
disassociates
his
claim?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
have
i
put
another
question
to
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
--
without
expert
testimony
in
regards
to
magazine,
would
you
think
these
were
excludable?
could
you
defend
this
case
on
that
--
without
expert
testimony?
justice
john
m.
harlan
from
the
magazine,
i'm
sorry.
