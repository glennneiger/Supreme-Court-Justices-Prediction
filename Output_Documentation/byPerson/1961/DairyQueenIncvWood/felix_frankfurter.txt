(voice

did
it
challenge
the
contract
--
that
the
original
contract
was
breached?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
present
petitioner,
in
the
answer,
challenged
the
claim
in
the
complaint
or
the
--
what
you
call
the
background
operative
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
they
--
did
they
challenge
if
--
if
they
insist
that
the
old
contract
was
still
alive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
existence
of
the
original
contract
or
is
not
an
issue
in
this
litigation
or
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
that
an
--
an
issue
antecedent,
necessarily
antecedent
determination
whether
you
can
claim
what
you
claim
namely
that
they
are
operating
outside
of
the
agreement
and
therefore
all
these
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
you're
--
you're
in
conflict
on
whether
that
original
contract
on
the
date
which
they
were
licensees
still
alive,
are
you
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
i
know,
but
if
they
--
if
they
stand
on
their
rights
under
the
contract,
is
that
not
an
adjudicable
issue
in
this
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
before
you
get
to
the
equitable
thing,
you
must
decide
whether
they
still
have
a
contract
under
which
they're
legally
operated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
why
is
that
antecedent
to
any
equitable
relief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
did
the
--
did
the
present
petitioner
accept
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
petitioner
will
say
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
original
contract
is
no
longer
in
existence.
yes,
we're
not
operating
under
that
(voice
overlap)
then
the
rights
we
may
have
are
outside
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
bound
by
that
when
it
goes
back
to
the
permanent
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
then
i
--
if
you'll
forgive
me,
i'll
repeat
my
question.
why
isn't
the
determination,
the
resolution
of
that
conflict
you
say
the
original
conflict
is
gone,
he
should
not
leave.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
that
not
a
--
a
legal
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
decide
what
the
--
what
the
relief
should
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
does
bring
in
to
controversy
whether
a
contract
exists
or
is
dead.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
not
a
legal
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
we've
got
here.
we
have
--
this
is
a
suit
within
four
specific
performance
of
a
contract.
and
the
defendant
said,
there
is
no
contract
or
this
is
a
--
there
is
no
contract.
here,
you've
got
a
suit
based
for
money,
the
antecedent
of
which
is
that
the
contract
is
no
longer
in
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
a
breach
of
contract
by
which
the
defendant
seeks
to
escape
money
damages
is
not
a
legal
question
you
can
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case,
if
i
don't
know
more
than
what
you've
stated
to
me
because
that's
what
i
read
with
judge
wood's
opinion.
in
this
case,
you
say
a
contract
is
no
longer
in
existence
and
therefore
it
is
subject
to
other
liabilities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
injunction,
not
to
misuse
the
name
for
which
he's
entitled
to,
money
that
he's
improperly
collected.
he
denied
this.
he
said,
"they
are
not
subject
to
those
moneys
that
are
coming."
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
contract
is
alive
and
i'm
merely
a
subject
to
the
terms
of
that
contract
in
whatever
parts,
monetary
duties
arrived
out
of
that
contract,
i
suppose
he
subjects
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
can
he
--
can
he
resist
your
--
your
prayers
for
relief
based
on
the
assumption
that
he
--
that
your
assumption
that
he
breached
this
contract
which
he
denies
and
he
says,
“i'm
not
subject
to
that.
this
contract
is
still
alive,
you
can
sue
me
for
whatever
--
for
whatever
rights
you
have
under
this
contract.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
sued
for
rights
--
your
rights
under
this
contract
where
would
that
be,
on
the
law
side
or
equity
side?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
now
said
something,
you
give
a
different
answer
to
what
my
whole
question
is
based
on,
namely
that
he
insists
that
the
original
contract
is
alive,
not
that
he
insists
that
it
should
be
reformed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
my
questions
derived
from
what
i
expect
from
counsel,
you
--
who
know
this
record
and
i
don't.
does
he
or
does
he
not
say
the
original
contract
(inaudible)
its
original
integrity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
he
inform
in
--
in
effect
grant
a
written
modification
of
this
contract
to
which
there
has
been
an
oral
--
about
which
has
been
an
oral
change?
is
that
what
he
want?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he
really
get
it
--
to
the
seek
reformation
of
the
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
seek
reformation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
seeks
reformation,
you
or
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
he
is
seeking
--
if
he
seeks
reformation
then
he
certainly
is
asking
for
equitable
relief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
move
on
from
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
before
you
move
to
another
illustration,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
ask
for
information
because
i
do
not
know.
in
view
of
--
in
view
of
the
seventh
amendment,
what
do
the
cases
tell
us
or
tell
me
that
doesn't
know.
well,
if
you
bring
your
suit
for
a
specific
performance
and
the
answer
is
one
that
the
so-called
agent
purported
to
make
this
contract
for
me
had
no
authority.
and
therefore,
there
was
no
contract.
and
two,
in
the
alternative
for
appropriate
equitable
reason,
there
shouldn't
be
specific
performance.
and
i
claim
a
jury
trial
for
on
--
my
first
defense
as
to
both
defenses
can
be
pleaded
on
the
modern
loose
or
free
or
rational
pleading?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
suppose
i
make
--
i
put
up
those
two
defenses
to
your
suit
bill
in
equity
for
a
specific
performance.
challenge
one,
challenging
the
existence
of
the
contract
because
the
fellow
purported
to
be
my
agent
was
my
agent
or
--
and
two
on
ground
of
equity,
there
shouldn't
be
specific
performance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
--
i'm
--
i
don't
want
theory.
not
not
the
quality
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
think
we
have
to
leave
the
theory
as
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
whether
this
question
has
arisen
under
the
requirement
of
the
seventh
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
be
divided
into
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
pomeroy
consider
our
problem
namely
what
restrictions
or
what
demands
the
seventh
amendment
makes
for
the
right
to
ask
for
a
jury
in
the
federal
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
is
he
dealing,
what
i
want
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
he
talking
seventh
amendment
or
is
he
talking
english
equity
procedure?
which?
they
are
very
different
as
you
well
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
if
it
was
settled
--
if
it
was
settled
before
the
constitution,
before
the
seventh
amendment
that
a
particular
question
is
on
the
equity
side
rather
on
the
more
side
that
is
a
gloss
on
the
seventh
amendment,
i
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
just
meant
to
convey
in
my
offered
advised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
fact
that
you
ask,
the
fact
that
has
suited
as
for
equitable
relief
doesn't
settle
the
question,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
nor
can
we
take
that
test
with
the
rules?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nor
can
we
take
that
test
whether
the
judge
--
justice
capable
of
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
have
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
mr.
ooms
cited
the
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
put
him
out
of
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
mr.
ooms
cited
the
case
put
it
out
of
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
only
case
that
you
know
of?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
strange
that
this
should
have
been
written
before
that
there
isn't
a
specific
answer
to
my
question
because
i
should
think
it
--
it
must
be
a
frequent
occurrence
that
when
specific
performances
sought,
you
challenge
the
justness
of
a
contract
because
of
lack
of
agency
of
the
agent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
everybody
that
you'll
leave
it.
so
what
would
be
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
these
four
judges
below
didn't,
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
this
question
of
jury
or
not
jury
have
to
be
determined
initially
on
the
--
on
the
pleadings
or
later
stages?
because,
if
--
if
the
question
is
raised
on
the
pleadings,
then
the
plaintiff
in
the
suit
doesn't
have
to
establish
existence
of
a
contract.
he
alleged
it
and
the
denial
of
the
existence
comes
from
the
defendant.
and
therefore
the
plaintiff
can
prove
this
case
without
--
just
on
his
inequitable
demand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
mean
to
suggest
of
every
question
of
fact
that
may
arise
in
an
equity
suit
when
you
try
and
it's
hard
to
think
of
an
equity
suit
in
which
questions
of
fact
do
not
arrive
has
to
be
sent
to
a
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
chancellor
made
call
in
the
jury
to
aid
him.
their
determination
is
just
advisory
when
he
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
can't
imagine
along
with
the
seventh
amendment
every
time
a
question
of
fact
arises
in
an
equity
suit,
you
have
to
summon
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
saying
there's
a
question
of
fact
doesn't
take
you
very
far
from
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
my
question,
if
i
make
a
deal
with
that,
then
if
--
if
a
question
is
raised
by
the
defendant
that
the
agent
exceeded
his
powers,
you
think
then
you'd
have
to
summon
the
jury
for
a
jury
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
every
determination
of
fact
by
the
chancellor
has
the
term
or
is
--
is
the
basis
for
res
judicata.
i
don't
see
that
that
helps
me
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
take
--
take
proceedings
brought
by
a
corporation
where
specific
performance
of
reformation
of
a
contract
or
whatnot
in
almost
every
such
case,
a
proper
corporate
proceeding
may
come
an
issue
in
fact
that
challenge
do
come
an
issue.
was
there
a
meeting
of
directors?
did
the
directors
have
powers
as
inappropriate
minute
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
et
cetera?
now,
those
issues,
if
the
corporation
didn't
act
according
to
the
requisite
form
or
corporate
procedure,
the
plaintiff
is
out
but
the
defendant
is
out
in
his
--
in
his
defense.
now,
what
bothers
me
to
get
some
guidelines
to
find
out
when
a
jury
must
be
summoned
or
when
the
jury
may
be
summoned,
must
be
the
seventh
amendment
chan
--
made
the
chancellor's
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
anymore
than
money
is
in
doubt,
you
better
have
a
jury
trial
because
the
supreme
court
may
reverse
it?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
doesn't
give
me
--
that
doesn't
enable
me
to
say
to
decide
or
i
should
think
about
this
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
again
just
say
where
it
had
been
bettered
just
would've
called
the
jury?
i
think
it
would've
been.
we
would
have
this
argument
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
there
has
been
no
contract
at
all,
equity
can,
in
addition
to
giving
its
impersona
relief
saying
mustn't
do
this
in
the
future
or
should
say
you've
been
unjustly
wrong,
unjustly
and
unjustly
enriched
and
walk
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
have
to
--
you
don't
have
to
call
a
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
equity
is
going
to
give
a
money
--
an
incidental
money
damage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose,
he
hasn't
asked
for
money
damages
in
this
suit,
what
would
the
situation
then
be?
or
if
he
said
that
i'll
leave
that
for
another
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
said
that,
it
once
was
a
--
just
as
by
way
of
a
recital,
a
way
of
exhaust
in
the
beginning,
by
way
of
--
of
certain
reasons.
he
says
there
once
was
a
contract
and
no
longer
is
a
contract,
therefore
i
have
no
business
to
use
my
trade
name
and
he's
engaged
in
unfair
trade
practices,
i
want
him
enjoined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
reply
and
say
“yes”,
the
contract
is
still
subsisting.
now,
would
that
be
a
jury
trial
in
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
beacon
--
in
beacon,
you
had
an
acknowledged
action
at
law
joined
with
an
action
in
equity.
and,
the
question
was
whether
the
district
court,
as
i
understand
it,
the
district
court
would
say,
“well,
i'll
deal
with
the
equity
problem
first,”
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
there
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
rather
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
conceded
action
at
law
requiring
a
jury
trial
and
that
involve
in
the
main
to
be
at
least
the
question
of
what
discretion
you
should
leave
to
the
trial
judge.
this
is
a
very
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
more
confusing
to
me.
