mr.
owen
j.
ooms
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
this
court
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
thank
you
your
honor,
i'm
sorry
for
(inaudible).
the
question
here
involved
is
a
very
simple
one.
and
that
is
whether
the
complaint
states
a
legal
cause
of
action
entitling
this
defendant
to
a
jury
trial.
petitioner
in
its
question
presented
to
the
court,
has
limited
himself
to
the
complaint
although
we
do
not
have
to
so
limit
it
in
order
to
find
that
all
that
is
involved
here
are
matters
of
equity
consideration
as
we
have
long
understood
them.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court,
however,
that
the
question
presented
is
an
error
for
two
primary
reasons.
the
question
presented
assumes
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
legal
cause
of
action
found
in
this
complaint
as
he
states
where
a
complaint
asserts
a
legal
cause
of
action
and
an
equitable
cause
of
action.
in
other
words,
the
question
presents,
assume
there
is
a
legal
question
presented
which
we
disagree
and
we
will
point
out
to
the
court.
further
in
the
question
presented,
it
is
stated
that
the
basis
of
both
cause
of
action
is
the
omission
of
defendant
to
pay
some
of
money.
now,
this
is
not
a
true
nor
an
accurate
presentation.
the
basis
of
this
cause
of
action
is
not
based
on
a
contract
which
was
cancelled
and
which
the
district
court
which
i
will
go
into
has
so
found
on
a
preliminary
injunction
hearing
but
the
fact,
what
the
defendant
did
subsequent
to
the
cancellation
of
the
contract.
now,
in
the
complaint,
there're
several
very
important
statements
made
which
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
an
alleged
$60,000.
it
is
true
that
the
statement
is
made
in
the
complaint
as
a
background
operative
fact
that
this
defendant,
petitioner
here
was
in
default
in
the
amount
of
$60,000.
it
further
states
that
the
plaintiff,
the
respondent
herein,
is
the
owner
of
the
dairy
queen
trademark
in
pennsylvania
and
throughout
the
united
states.
by
a
system
of
franchise
agreements
and
territory
agreements
throughout
the
united
states,
it
has
under
its
various
licenses
over
3000
such
dairy
queen
stores.
these
stores
are
similar
in
appearance
and
the
purpose
of
having
a
strict
control
over
these
stores
is
so
that
the
public
may
know
and
believe
that
this
product
which
they
purchased
is
the
same
throughout
the
united
states.
the
defendant
was
licensed
among
other
things
to
use
this
trademark.
it's
so
used
it.
it
complied
with
the
contract
and
so
far
as
making
basic
annual
payments
for
a
period
of
time.
it
ceased
making
these
annual
payments
and
as
the
defendant
asserts
in
its
answer,
not
by
way
of
a
counter
claim
or
a
cross
claim
that
this
agreement
was
modified
whether
we
call
it
a
reformation
of
the
contract
or
a
novation
in
the
contract.
he
says
it
was
modified
so
that
he
no
longer
had
to
make
this
annual
payment.
furthermore,
the
complaint
also
averse
that
after
this
contract
was
cancelled
by
the
defendant
for
a
failure
to
pay
not
only
this
sum
of
money
but
other
sums
of
money
through
a
third
independent
person
that
the
defendant
thereafter
began
unjustly
in
reaching
itself,
continue
to
hold
itself
out
as
a
licensed
dairy
queen
operator,
continue
to
receive
the
moneys
and
so
forth.
in
august
of
1960,
pursuant
to
paragraph
9
of
the
agreement,
which
is
attached
to
the
complaint
as
exhibit
a,
the
plaintiff
cancelled
that
contract
which
it
had
a
right
to
do.
now,
it
is
true
that
one
of
the
issues
raised
by
the
answer
is
whether
we
had
a
right
to
cancel
or
not
and
i
will
get
to
that
as
it
is
a
very
basic
premise
in
this
matter.
in
december,
we
filed
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
and
that
preliminary
injunction
was
heard,
evidence
and
witness
is
produced,
oral
argument
and
briefs.
on
december
28,
the
district
court,
the
same
judge
herein,
has
denied
the
petitioner
here,
his
right
to
a
jury
trial,
made
findings
of
facts.
these
findings
of
fact
are
in
the
appendix
d
in
brief
and
opposition
by
the
respondent
herein.
we
do
not
say
that
these
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
are
res
judicata
as
to
the
petitioner
hearing.
but
they
do
have
a
certain
standing
as
to
what
were
the
facts
are
in
this
matter,
and
this
is
what
we
get
to
the
crux
of
the
problem
that
the
complaint
herein
is
not
based
on
the
contract.
the
district
court
found
that
the
contract
was
breached
whether
it'd
be
for
reason
of
default
of
payment
of
money.
that
is
only
the
operative
fact
for
bringing
the
complaint
into
being.
the
fact
that
it
was
breached,
this
defendant
continued
to
collect
moneys,
it
had
no
right
to
do.
it
continued
to
use
the
dairy
queen
trademark.
it
continued
to
hold
itself
out
as
a
licensed
dairy
queen
operator.
the
court
granted,
under
the
question
of
balancing
the
equity
in
the
case,
a
limited
preliminary
injunction.
this
was
december
28,
1960.
defendant,
although
the
complaint
had
been
filed
in
november,
had
not
filed
an
answer
of
any
type
at
this
time.
it
appealed
the
preliminary
injunction
which
was
affirmed
but
approximately
two
months
after
--
after
the
court
had
rendered
this
decision
in
the
preliminary
injunction,
it
filed
its
answer
and
the
answer
did
not
again
include
any
counterclaim
or
cross
complaint,
it
merely
raised
some
antitrust
issues,
the
same
that
we
were
barred
from
any
relief,
not
asking
for
any
affirmative
relief
and
further
stated
this
modification
in
the
contract.
we
say
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
yes,
your
honor.
the
letter
was
stated
that
it
was
breached.
we
considered
it
breached.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
yes,
they
did
challenge.
they
said
there
was
a
modification
with
the
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
they
insisted
it
was
alive
as
modified
by
some
oral
agreement.
now,
they
don't
use
the
word
novation
or
renovation
or
reformation.
the
district
court
in
its
opinion,
call
it
an
attempt
at
(inaudible).
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
the
existence
of
the
continuation
of
this
license
agreement
is
an
issue
in
this
litigation.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that
is
correct
your
honor.
if
in
fact
the
contract
had
not
been
canceled
or
that
we
did
not
effect
a
proper
cancellation
because
in
--
in
effect,
there
was
a
novation
or
reformation
of
this
contract
then
we
have
no
standing
before
the
court.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
i
don't
think
so
at
all,
your
honor.
the
mere
fact
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
--
the
mere
fact
that
a
contract
has
been
breached
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
a
legal
issue
has
been
intruded
into
the
scene.
one
made
by
breaching
a
contract
or
cancelling
a
contract
as
for
specific
performance.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that
is
correct.
framed
within
the
equitable
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
the
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
well,
the
court
didn't
make
that
finding
already
on
witnesses
and
everything
else
that
the
--
and
--
and
testimony
and
exhibits
that
this
contract
in
the
hearing
for
preliminary
injunction
was
in
fact
breached
and
have
not
been
cured.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
the
present
petitioner
appealed
it.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
obviously,
not
--
you'll
feel
it
your
honor.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
at
no
time
did
he
do
that.
he
appealed
the
decision
of
the
--
granting
the
preliminary
injunction
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
affirmed
the
district
court.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
as
res
judicata,
no
sir.
he's
entitled
to
a
full
hearing
on
that.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that's
correct.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
well,
the
mere
fact
that
a
contract
whether
it
has
been
cancelled
or
not,
your
honor
does
not
immediately
makes
this
a
legal
question.
the
question
is,
what
if
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
no,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that
is
correct
and
on
the
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
no,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that
is
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that
is
absolutely
our
reformation
(voice
overlap)
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
judge
wood
in
his
opinion
cites
the
fact
of
a
cancellation
of
a
contract
framed
within
the
equity
forms
as
we
know
it,
is
one
that
has
been
cognizable
by
courts
of
equity
from
time
and
memorial.
in
other
words,
if
we
had
come
in
here
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
i
disagree,
your
honor.
this
is
not
a
suit
based
for
--
for
money,
there
is
much
more.
we
say
we
have
effectively
canceled
the
contract.
it
is
true
the
defendant
herein
contest
that
fact.
we
say
that
the
acts
subsequent
to
our
effective
cancellation
makes
it
necessary
for
a
court
of
equity
to
enjoin
this
defendant
on
a
preliminary
injunction
basis
until
a
final
hearing
from
doing
these
various
acts
and
to
take
whatever
money
he
is
receiving
and
pay
them
into
the
registry
of
a
court.
now,
in
effect
what
he
is
doing
by
his
answer
and
he
--
and
this,
we
have
to
distinguish
from
the
beacon
versus
westover
case
and
so
forth.
the
beacon
versus
westover
case
was
where
the
defendant
filed
a
counterclaim
which
clearly
raised
legal
issues.
and
the
court
thereby
--
the
opinion
by
justice
black
stated
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
on
these
legal
issues.
and
that
he
was
entitled
to
go
forward
with
them
before
the
hearing,
before
the
chancellor
for
the
simple
reason
that
because
he
had
filed,
that
is
that
plaintiff
had
filed
a
declaratory
judgment
relief,
he
couldn't
have
anticipated
and
--
and
removed
any
chance
for
the
defendant
to
have
a
trial.
therefore,
the
legal
issue
should
be
heard
first
since
there
might
be
collateral,
estoppel
or
estoppel
by
judgment.
we
don't
have
that
issue
here.
we
have
set
forth
a
fact
that
this
defendant
has
banned
in
default
in
60
--
to
the
amount
of
$60,000.
this
is
the
operative
fact
for
--
one
of
the
operative
facts
might
i
add.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
the
contract
says
that
he
must
pay
the
money
that's
sent
forth
under
the
contract
or
else
we
can
immediately
cancel
the
agreement.
and
--
in
paragraph
9,
it
says
this
is
of
the
essence
of
the
contract
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
--
9
and
12.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that
is
correct.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that's
right
and
we
had
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
if
a
breach
of
contract
was
a
claim
for
money
damages
as
judge
wood
stated
in
his
lower
opinion,
if
it's
for
money
damages
then
it's
clearly
cognizable
by
law
and
he's
entitled
to
a
right
for
a
jury
trial.
but
that
is
what
we're
here
for
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
please
rephrase
that
again
your
honor.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that
is
correct.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that's
correct.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that
would
be
a
correct
position
on
his
part
and
he
perhaps
could
have
done
this
by
availing
himself
under
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
after
we
had
told
him
that
he
had
breached
the
contract.
but
we
are
proceeding
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
let
me
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
we'll
be
on
the
equity
side
in
this
case
your
honor
because
he's
trying
to
reform
a
written
instrument
and
as
judge
wood
has
cited
the
cases
and
if
we
had
cited
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
--
on
the
last
page
of
our
brief.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
the
answer
then
is
no
your
honor.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
he
says
it
has
been
modified.
now,
it
does
not
remain
in
its
entirety.
in
other
words,
we
are
not
proceeding
under
a
contract
as
it
was
originally
drafted.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
i
couldn't
answer
that
question.
no
one
has
asked
him
and
i
don't
know.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that
is
correct.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
i
used
the
word
reformation
in
the
district
court.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
he
does
where
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
i
would
say
that
the
answer
certainly,
he
speaks
exactly
what
he
is
not
saying
here,
namely
when
he
was
in
modification,
it's
framed
in
the
equitable
side,
in
our
prayer
for
the
complaint,
we
asked
for
three
things,
an
injunction
enjoining
him
from
the
use
of
this
trademark,
from
holding
himself
as
the
license
operator
and
from
collecting
money
as
a
dairy
queen
operator.
number
two,
and
accounting
for
all
damages.
now
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
unless
he
has
breached
this
contract
in
total,
no,
your
honor.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that
is
correct
and
we
say
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
we
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
because
the
fact
that
this
breach
of
contract
as
he
is
saying,
we
have
a
good
contract.
here's
the
position
he
is
in,
we
have
a
good
contract
but
it's
been
modified
as
such.
if
it's
been
modified
as
the
district
court
said
then
there's
a
no
novation.
a
novation
of
a
contract
is
one
cognizable
in
equity.
if
it
is
as
i
say,
an
attempt
at
reformation
of
the
contract,
that
is
still
under
the
law
that
we
have
cited.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
no,
the
contract
does
not
give
him
the
right
to
do
this
at
all.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
no,
he
does
not
say
that.
he
says
that
“i
am
still
under
this
contract
but
we
have
modified
the
oral
payment
--
the
payments
of
this
by
some
oral
agreement.”
we
modify
it
if
that
is
--
the
party
has
modified
it.
we
deny
this
and
we
asked
him
for
strict
accounting
for
the
moneys,
not
only
the
$60,000.
now,
it's
unfortunate.
but
let
me
phrase
the
hypothetical
if
it
please,
justice
harlan.
if
we
had
never
mentioned
the
$60,000
as
the
background
operative
fact
for
the
breach
of
the
contract
as
well
as
other
sums
of
money,
and
merely
said
that
he
breached
the
contract,
the
question
would
then
arise,
have
we
in
anyway
injected
anything,
any
money
amounts
as
what
he
claims
we
have
here,
we
have
a
debt
--
an
action
in
debt.
we
don't
claim
the
action
in
debt.
we
claim
this
$60,000
as
only
one
element
of
the
accounting
which
we
ask
for.
now,
could
it
be
said
then
if
we
never
mentioned
the
$60,000
as
there
was
here,
a
legal
action.
when
he
--
when
he
says,
“no,
i
didn't
breach,
we
didn't
breach
the
contract
because
what
we
have
done
--”
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
alright,
because
what
we
have
done
has
orally
modified
this
agreement.
in
other
words,
we
either
inserted,
made
a
novation
in
it
or
reformation
of
it.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court,
at
the
recess,
we
were
having
some
colloquy
with
respect
to
whether
in
the
question
presented
here,
the
breach
of
a
contract
involved
a
question
of
law
or
not.
i
believe,
i
may
in
the
colloquy
which
justice
frankfurter
engendered
some
confusion.
the
question
of
whether
the
breach
of
a
contract
must
be
determined
as
to
whether
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
relief
or
not
does
not
necessarily
involve
a
question
of
law.
it
is
a
question
of
fact
that
the
court
may
and
must
determine
before
it
can
grant
whatever
relief
the
plaintiff
asks.
now,
the
fact
that
the
court
must
determine
a
question
of
fact
is
nothing
uncommon
or
unusual.
we
find
that
in
all
and
many
cases
of
equity.
if
i
may
use
a
phrase
and
an
illustration,
if
i
alleged
that
a
tort
has
been
committed
against
me
and
file
a
suit
to
enjoin
further
torts,
the
common
question
of
fact
is
whether
in
the
first
place
a
tort
was
committed.
that
still
does
not
take
it
outside
the
purview
of
a
cause
of
acton
for
the
chancellor
alone.
similarly,
in
a
suit
by
one
in
possession
of
real
property
to
acquire
a
title
or
to
remove
a
cloud
on
the
title,
the
court
of
equity
may
determine
the
legal
title.
there
still
is
the
common
question
of
facts.
in
a
suit
for
a
specific
performance
of
a
contract,
the
court
of
equity
may
determine
the
making,
the
validity
and
terms
of
the
contract.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
i
have
just
one
more
simple
illustration,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that's
right.
the
alternative
pleadings
may
be
employed,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
your
honor,
there
is
a
common
question
of
fact
to
be
determined
in
both
cases.
one,
whether
there
is
an
existence
of
a
contract,
this
is
a
question
of
fact
and
not
law
to
be
determined
by
this
specific
relief
asked
for
their
specific
performance.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
no,
the
--
the
case
is
a
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
pomeroy.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
specifically,
i
could
not
answer
whether
the
specific
illustration
given
by
the
court
has
been.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
no,
it's
--
it's
closed.
it's
akin
to
it
but
not
quite.
not
quite,
your
honor.
it's
somewhat
different.
and
the
illustrations
that
i
am
quoting
come
from
pomeroy
which
justice
stewart
quoted
in
one
of
his
decisions.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
the
section
on
pomeroy,
which
i
am
quoting
from
your
honor,
deals
specifically
whether
one
is
entitled
to
a
question
of
jury.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
under
the
seventh
amendment.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
i
understand
that
your
honor.
and
they
--
he
has
been
quoted
in
subsequent
cases
as
under
the
seventh
amendment
which
justice
stewart
did
deal
with
in
his
opinion.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
it
might
be
but
as
i
understand
the
cases
your
honor,
they
say
that
the
seventh
amendment
did
not
in
any
way
changed
whether
it
is
an
equity
question
or
a
legal
question.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
right.
now,
what
do
we
have
in
this
case,
your
honor?
we
first
must
determine
the
breach
of
the
contract.
this
is
the
question
of
fact
which
the
trier
must
try.
in
terms
of
what
the
relief
is
asked
and
under
all
the
cases,
as
i
have
been
able
to
see
it,
as
judge
wood
has
said,
this
is
an
equity
case.
we
have
asked
for
injunctive
relief
for
trademark
infringement
in
the
county
and
another
injunction
pendent
lite
for
money
is
unjustly
received
to
be
paid
in
to
the
registry
of
the
court.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
not
necessarily.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
you
must
look
at
the
complaint
in
its
entirety
and
the
answer
in
its
entirety.
and
there
are
always
going
to
be
questions
of
fact
which
necessarily
do
not
mean
they're
questions
of
law.
and
the
court
of
equity,
the
chancellor
is
in
just
as
good
at
position
to
answer
them
as
--
as
a
jury,
if
i
might
say,
without
violating
the
seventh
amendment
to
the
constitution.
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
pardon?
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
no,
i
don't
think
that's
--
mr.
owen
j.
ooms
that's
an
ultimate
test
at
all.
let
me,
in
conclusion
because
i
see
my
time
is
rapidly
coming
to
an
end,
your
honor,
state
that
and
read
from
what
the
--
judge
wood
found
and
stated
what
the
complaint
involves.
the
complaint
seeks
in
effect
a
declaration
that
the
licensing
contract
is
null
and
void
and
accounting
of
profits
illegally
obtained
by
the
defendant
since
1942
to
date
and
a
permanent
injunction
restraining
the
defendants
from
any
use
of
plaintiff's
trademark.
now,
what
do
we
have
here
as
it
is
presented
here?
a
preliminary
injunction
was
granted
december
28,
1960.
on
march
1,
this
defendant
came
in
after
he
felt
the
ill
win
of
the
chancellor's
viewpoint
as
to
what
was
involved
here.
and
we
obtained
a
preliminary
injunction.
what
he
is
seeking
here
now
is
to
get
a
new
trier
of
the
facts
and
further
delay
for
his
final
day
of
accounting.
your
honor,
under
these
circumstances,
we
ask
the
supreme
court
here
to
invoke
rule
562
that
is
set
forth
on
page
56
of
the
court's
rules.
thank
you,
your
honor.
