mr.
michael
h.
egnal
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
in
a
civil
action.
the
district
court
judge
denied
the
demand
for
a
jury
trial
and
his
reasons
briefly
were
that
upon
a
consideration
of
the
issues
raised
in
the
complaint
and
answer,
he
concluded
that
the
action
was
purely
equitable
although
he
found
that
this
complaint
included
a
demand
for
the
payment
of
$60,000,
allegedly
do
by
reason
of
the
breach
of
contract
of
a
facts
or
rather
scan.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
held
a
franchise
for
the
use
of
the
trademark,
dairy
queen,
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
and
this
agreement
was
made
in
october
of
1949.
the
agreement
provided
that
the
total
consideration
for
the
payment
of
this
franchise
was
$150,000,
which
a
thousand
was
paid
at
the
execution
of
the
agreement
and
the
balance
was
to
be
paid
from
the
proceeds,
50%
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
sub-franchises
provided
that
beginning
with
october
of
1955,
there
was
to
be
paid
not
less
than
$18,625
per
annum.
this
payment
was
made
regularly
until
october
of
1954,
and
it
was
not
made
at
that
time.
but
the
parties
in
january
of
1955
reached
a
normal
agreement
that
thereafter,
the
obligation
of
the
petitioner
was
to
merely
pay
50%
of
the
sales
of
sub-franchises
and
there
would
no
longer
be
any
need
to
meet
this
annual
minimum
payment.
this
continued
for
six
years
thereafter.
the
parties
were
harmonious
until
august
of
1960
when
the
plaintiff
in
the
action
below,
took
the
position
that
there
was
now
due
and
owing
the
entire
balance
which
was
some
$60,000
payable
under
the
contract
and
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
raised
that
was
a
repudiation
of
the
oral
agreement
which
had
modified
the
original
written
agreement
and
which
had
been
implemented
for
some
six
years.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes
sir.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes
sir,
made
in
january
of
1955,
and
as
i
say,
implemented
for
the
next
six
years.
now,
when
the
complaint
was
filed,
it
--
or
i'm
ahead
of
myself.
in
august
of
1960,
the
position
of
the
plaintiff
below
changed
and
it
then
demanded
the
payment
of
the
balance
to
one
of
the
contract
which
was
indicated
by
a
letter.
that's
exhibit
c
attached
to
the
complaint.
and
in
that
letter,
it
expressly
recited
that
unless
you
pay
the
balance
due
and
owing
under
the
contract,
we
will
consider
that
a
material
breach
and
we
will
cancel
the
franchise.
that
position
was
not
recognized
by
the
petitioner
and
subsequently
a
complaint
was
filed.
in
the
complaint,
it
was
sort
to
enjoin
on
the
theory
that
the
--
that
the
franchise
had
been
cancelled
by
this
x-party
declaration
of
the
plaintiff
below
to
cancel
the
franchise,
restrain
the
petitioner
from
many
further
use
of
the
trademark
and
they
will
restrain
the
petitioner
from
collecting
any
moneys
which
it
would
be
an
incident
of
a
continued
use
of
the
franchise
and
for
a
judgment
of
the
amount
due
and
owing
under
the
contract.
our
position
briefly
is
that
while
there
was
cloth
in
this
complaint,
some
equitable
attire
that
basically,
before
there
could
be
any
equitable
relief,
this
plaintiff
had
to
establish
that
there
was
a
breach
of
a
contract,
that
there
was
an
amount
due
under
the
contract.in
other
words,
he
would
have
to
sustain
the
--
the
legal
course
of
action.
and
if
that
could
be
sustained,
he
would
then
become
entitled
to
equitable
relief.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
well
he
--
in
his
prayers,
in
his
prayers,
he
uses
the
conventional
prayers
that
would
be
found
in
a
complaint
equity
asking
that
the
court
enjoin
this
defendant,
the
petitioner,
from
any
further
use
of
a
trade
name.
he
uses
a
phrase
that
the
court
should
grant
an
accounting
for
the
amount
due
and
owing
under
the
contract
and
uses
the
--
the
terminology
which
is
peculiar
to
equity
proceeding.
that
is
what
i
mean
by
the
attire.
now,
we
take
the
position
that
regardless
of
how
much
there
is
in
evaluating
this
complaint,
how
much
there
maybe
a
scribe
for
the
legal
course
of
action,
if
there
is
a
legal
course
of
action
involved
in
this
preceding,
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
cannot
be
denied.
and
of
course,
we
--
we
rely
on
what
this
court
said
both
in
its
majority
and
my
minority
opinion
in
beacon
theatres
versus
westover
which
has
recently
been
put
directly,
it
seems
to
me
in
point
on
this
proposition
in
the
thermo-stitch
case.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
that
is
it
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
is
the
case
where
judge
wood
after
denying
the
jury
trial,
fixed
the
case
for
trial
on
august
1
preemptively,
a
trial
before
him
without
a
jury.
you
were
branded
a
stay
on
july,
the
31st.
i
--
i'll
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
with
your
honor's
kind
permission
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
--
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
your
question
may
find
an
answer
in
a
case
cited
here
by
the
respondent
on
behalf
of
this
plaintiff
in
chappell
which
is
a
case
that
came
out
of
the
first
circuit.
in
that
case,
the
opinion,
as
i
recall,
it
indicated
--
excuse
me
--
that
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
contract
was
made
is
a
question
of
fact
that
would
be
determined
by
a
jury.
now,
it
seems
--
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
chappell
versus
palermo.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
he
cited
that
case.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
well,
that's
what
the
case
does
indicate.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
well,
we
sought
--
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
well,
it
may
be
that
this
is
more
or
less
regarded
as
hornbook
because
--
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
it
would
seem
that
way.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
no.
now,
it
seems
self-evident
in
this
case
that
mr.
ooms,
with
an
awareness
of
the
fact
that
his
demand
in
the
complaint
for
the
balance
due
under
the
written
contract
creates
a
legal
course
of
action
is
attempting
to
obscure
that.
but,
i
think,
your
honors
will
find
that
the
complaint
in
itself
says
that
rather
specifically
and
judge
wood
below
understood
it
quite
clearly
because
in
his
opinion,
which
is
at
page
36
of
the
record,
he
said
in
clear
language,
“incidental
to
this
relief,
the
complaint
also
demands
the
$60,000,
now
allegedly
do
and
owing
plaintiffs
under
the
aforesaid
contract”.
and
we
took
his
phrase
of
“incidental
to
this
relief”
to
mean
that
he
was
giving
it
a
subordinate
position
that
the
dominate
phase
of
the
case
in
his
opinion
was
equitable.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
where
judge
wood
erred
in
not
accepting
the
teachings
of
beacon
that
regardless
of
what
evaluation,
the
two
courses
of
action
should
be
given,
if
there
was
present
illegal
course
of
action
which
he
recognized,
this
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
now,
i'd
like
to
conclude
with
just
two
short
paragraphs.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
beacon,
where
you
had
two
separate
courses
of
action,
one
equitable,
one
legal,
and
this
court
denied
the
right
of
the
--
of
the
court
below
to
postpone
the
trial
of
the
legal
course
of
action
as
a
deprivation
of
the
rights
under
the
seventh
amendment
and
in
thermo-stitch,
which
followed
that
in
the
fifth
circuit
where
you
had
two
independent
courses
of
action,
one
legal
and
one
equitable,
in
which
the
same
result
was
imposed.
we
come
to
our
case
which
seems
to
be
even
more
compelling
because
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
a
legal
course
of
action
and
an
equitable
which
are
dependent.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
can
be
no
equitable
relief
in
this
case
until
this
plaintiff
has
established
the
legal
course
of
action
because
this
case
being
heard
by
a
jury
would
first
determine
whether
there
was
a
breach
of
the
contract,
whether
any
sums
were
due
under
the
contract.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
accepting
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
get
then
to
the
question
of
fact
which
is
common
to
both
his
position
and
the
defendant's
position.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
no,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
i
agree
with
that,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
no,
sir.
i
should
go
on
and
say
where
the
question
of
fact
involves
an
issue
which
is
a
legal
course
of
action.
and
the
legal
course
of
action
in
this
case
is
that
demand
for
the
--
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
for
the
reason
that
that
this
question
of
fact,
if
it
is
left
to
the
chancellor,
would
--
would
be
in
the
nature
of
a
res
judicata
or
an
estoppel
that
would
determine
a
legal
course
of
action
without
a
jury
trial.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
i
think
that,
as
i
read
the
cases,
the
distinction
is
not
whether
there
is
a
question
of
fact
but
whether
the
questions
of
fact
are
involved
in
an
issue
that
make
out
a
legal
course
of
action
or
to
put
it
in
a
converse
that
do
not,
in
anyway,
fall
within
the
scope
over
either
equity
or
admiralty.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
well,
apparently,
if
the
question
is
closed,
the
--
the
chancellor
or
the
jury
--
the
court
must
favor
the
implementation
of
the
seventh
amendment.
now,
if
there
is
a
clearly
an
equitable
course
of
action
that
involves
questions
of
fact,
i
would
say
that
a
jury
trial
would
not
be
available
and
in
the
cases
that
have
preceded
this.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
i'm
--
yes,
sir.
i'm
saying
that
because
--
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
well,
i
would
say
--
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
well,
i
would
say
that
if
this
case
did
not
have
present,
what
appears
in
the
pleadings
and
from
the
judge's
opinion
that
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff
is
seeking
to
recover
$60,000
which
admittedly
is
an
action
for
debt.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
well,
i
think
in
that
--
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
no,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
no,
sir.
now,
i
think
that
that
may
point
out
the
distinction.
and,
i
think
you've
mentioned
that
in
your
question
yesterday.
whether
this
particular
demand
for
the
$60,000
as
empty
seat
where
if
in
this
case
the
defendant
was
a
wrongdoing
ab
initio
and
it
was
sort
to
restrain
further
acts,
equity
would
have
jurisdiction
and
if
the
consequences
of
that
were
to
make
for
damages
as
there
would
be
no
right
to
a
jury
trial
but
this
case
is
distinguished
by
the
sequence
in
reverse.
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff
is
saying,
you
breached
the
contract
by
not
paying
me
$60,000.
and
because
you
owed
a
$60,000,
having
established
that,
i
want
the
court
to
enjoin
you
permitting
for
the
rights
under
this
contract.
the
complete
reverse
of
what
might
be
an
equitable
course
of
action.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
well,
if
he
had
said
that
in
his
initial
complaint.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
alright.
now
--
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
i
would
say
yes
for
this
reason
that
the
cases
indicate
that
the
--
the
consideration
must
be
given
to
both
the
complaint
and
the
other
pleadings
in
the
case.
in
a
--
in
a
--
in
a
beacon,
the
consideration
was
given
to
the
complaint,
the
answer
the
counterclaim
in
the
course
of
action
in
the
thermo-stitch
to
the
complaint
similarly.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
--
but
in
--
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
and
subsisting.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
to
answer
the
first
part
of
your
question,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
don't
think
the
prayers
are
controlling
because
under
our
rule
54
(c),
if
during
the
trial
of
the
case,
it
should
appear
that
there
is
facts
to
support
a
judgment.
irrespective
of
the
prayers,
the
court
would
have
or
the
jury
would
have
the
right
to
find
that
kind
of
a
judgment.
i
think
the
prayers
are
merely
in
an
advisory
category.
however,
this
prayer
does
throw
light
on
what
the
plaintiff
is
seeking.
the
preliminary
paragraphs
in
the
complaint
of
where
the
failure
to
pay
the
$60,000,
they
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
was
because
of
the
refusal
to
pay
the
$60,000
that
this
action
was
instituted.
you
can
see
that
from
the
letter
of
cancellation,
purported
letter
of
cancellation
which
is
exhibit
c
on
page
27
in
which
they
said
this
letter
is
to
advise
you
that
your
failure
to
pay
the
amounts
required
in
your
contract
then
further,
unless
it's
completely
satisfied
to
the
amount
due
and
owing.
so,
i
say
that
upon
a
consideration
of
the
complaint
and
the
prayer,
this
is
seems
to
be
on
unequivocally
a
demand
to
recover
from
this
defendant
$60,000
which
is
the
balance,
according
to
the
plaintiff's
position,
now
due
and
owing
--
and
due
and
owing
under
the
contract.
and
judge
wood
found
that
that
was
so.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
the
issue
there
is
their
repudiation
of
what
we
contend
was
the
oral
agreement
made
in
january
of
1955.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
they
claim
that
we
didn't
make
the
payments
in
a
strict
accordance
with
the
written
contract.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
with
the
written
contract.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
five
minimum
per
year.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
and
that
totaled
to
approximately
$60,000.
we
had
paid
$90,000
by
making
four
--
the
first
four
years,
we've
paid
the
minimum
of
$18,625.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
you
mean,
try
that
just
before
a
chancellor
alone?
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
no,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
now,
the
one
is
superimposed
on
the
other.
and
our
position
here
is
that
you
can't
get
to
the
other
until
they've
established
that
claim.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
and
you
said
it
in
ringing
terms
and
your
descending
opinion
in
galloway.
now,
it
would
have
been
a
simple
matter
here
to
proceed
with
the
trial
of
this
case
before
a
jury
because
if
there
was
any
equitable
relief
available
to
this
plaintiff,
it
could've
been
afforded
in
the
--
in
the
single
proceeding.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
well,
as
we
read
the
complaint,
that
would
be
a
fair
inference.
that
in
addition
of
a
$60,000,
they
are
reaching
out
some
place
for
alleged
damages
which
would
come
after
we've
been
establish
as
a
wrongdoing.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
well,
along
the
theory
that
--
that
this
is
a
little
hard
for
us
to
comprehend
because
the
total
consideration
is
$150,000
if
we
pay
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
all
of
the
rights
have
been
satisfied
but
they
think
there
might
be
something
in
addition
to
that.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
that
would
--
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
h.
egnal
yes,
sir.
and
that
would
come
at
the
--
at
the
terminal
end
of
a
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
did
go
in
with
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
which
is
not
part
of
these
proceedings
and
got
such
relief
as
the
chancellor
thought
they
should've
gotten
which
was
at
minimum.
thank
you
very
much,
sir.
