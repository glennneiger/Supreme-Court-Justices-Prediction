justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
the
respondent
or
the
defendant,
original
defendant
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
your
defense
was
this
alleged
oral
agreement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
equitable
relief
or
the
equitable
attire,
whatever
that
phrase
that
you
(voice
overlap)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying
in
essence
is
that
the
substance,
the
real
guts
of
this
cause
of
action
is
simply
an
action
for
breach
of
contract?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
essence.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
put
it
the
other
way
around,
what
he
stands
on
is
a
contract
right
which
he
has
do
what
you
claim
he
has
no
license.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
ultimately
your
issue
between
you
is
whether
there's
a
breach
of
contract.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
isn't
that
a
legal
cause
of
action?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
in
reformation
of
the
contract
is
there
--
you
just
said
that
the
contract
is
--
just
made
the
right
to
do
this.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
he
said
at
times.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
basis
on
which
they
claim
the
$60,000?
what
do
they
allege
you
have
done
to
entitle
them
to
$60,000?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
does
that
mean?
do
they
claim
that
you
breached
or
abided
by
your
contract?
justice
john
m.
harlan
strict
accordance
with
contracts?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i,
suppo
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
instead
of
couching
that
complain
and
the
prayer
and
the
language
they
did
and
it
simply
said
that
it
were
the
truth
in
the
proceeding
that
you
have
breached
your
contract
to
their
that
you
needed
an
accounting
because
they
didn't
know
exactly
what
you
got
and
what
you're
going
to
get,
so
that
in
addition
to
suing
you
for
the
breach
of
contract,
they
wanted
to
supplement
that
by
common
lawsuit
but
an
--
equitable
accounting.
would
you
say
that
that
would
give
them
a
right
to
file
the
breach
of
contract
issue
because
they
later
wanted
to
collect
their
money
by
either
to
discover
an
equity
together?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
does
it
make
any
difference
that
they
in
collecting
the
money
which
they
alleged
to
use
them
because
of
the
breach
of
contract,
they
also
wanted
an
accounting
in
order
to
forbid
you
to
do
some
things
in
the
future
by
injunction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
separate
and
distinct,
was
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
argument
is
that
if
we
follow
the
beacon
case
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
the
duty
of
the
court
first
to
try
that
issue
which
was
plainly
an
issue
if
breach
of
contract
which
traditionally
has
been
a
common
law
of
cause
of
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
before
they
--
that
they
shouldn't
have
exercise
discretion
in
connection
with
the
other.
isn't
that
about
what
you've
said
in
the
beacon
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
that
be
in
the
nature
of
a
tort,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
something
like
a
malicious
interference
with
contract
or
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
maliciously
interfering
with
their
patent
rights
or
their
copyright
rights
or
trade
--
trade
rights?
