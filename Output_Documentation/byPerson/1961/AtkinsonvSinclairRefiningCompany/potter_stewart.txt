justice
potter
stewart
i'm
sorry
to
back
track
a
little
bit.
before
you
get
into
the
norris-laguardia,
i'm
going
little
further
with
justice
douglas'
inquiry,
a
little
different
aspect
of
it
with
respect
to
the
individual
employees
when
you
say
for
several
reasons
cannot
be
made
defendants
here,
could
an
individual
employee
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
contained
a
no
lockout
clause
sue
as
an
individual,
sue
the
employer
--
employer
under
section
301
if
he
were
locked
out?
justice
potter
stewart
assume
there
wasn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
grievance?
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
what
grievance
procedure?
i'm
assuming
there
is
no
grievance
procedure.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
been
no-lockout
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
an
individual
employee
could
not
bring
a
suit?
justice
potter
stewart
kind
of
a
derivative
suit.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
the
union
hasn't
been
locked
out,
the
employees
have
been
locked
out.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
fellow
says,
"i've
been
locked
out
and
i'm
not
suing
for
wages.
i'm
suing
for
the
right
to
get
in
there
and
work
for
not
only
wages
but
for
the
--
all
the
other
things
that
come
to
me
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement."
justice
potter
stewart
well,
could
this
--
could
--
could
an
employee
bring
this
suit
in
the
federal
courts
under
section
301?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
doesn't.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
doesn't.
now,
you
look
at
the
--
look
at
the
--
what
is
written,
suits
for
violation
of?
justice
potter
stewart
of
contract
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
labor
organizations.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
say
who
shall
bring
them
or
who
--
who
shall
be
the
plaintiffs
or
who
shall
be
the
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
would
this
matter
standing
be
something
which
the
federal
district
court
should
refer
to
state
law
to
determine
the
answer
to
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
--
i
think
you
said
he
didn't
have
stature
and
i
suppose
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
he
didn't
have
standing.
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
a
question
of
federal
law?
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
standing
to
sue.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
i
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
think
i'm
right
in
saying
that
the
statute
doesn't,
certainly
by
its
terms,
specify
who
the
plaintiff
needs
to
be.
i
think
it
says
suits
for
violation
of
contracts
made
by
labor
organizations.
i
was
wondering
if
an
individual
employee
could
bring
such
a
suit
in
a
federal
court
under
section
301
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
he
had
been
locked
out
by
an
employer
who
would
sign
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
saying
he
would
not
lockout
his
employees.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
he
might,
i
think.
and
he's
the
one
who's
been
hurt,
isn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
we're
--
i've
alleged
a
little
appeal
but
i
--
i
was
just
testing
out
the
first
part
of
your
argument
that
no
suit
could
be
ever
be
brought
against
individuals.
i
wondered
if
individuals
as
plaintiffs
could
bring
them
in
according
to
you.
justice
potter
stewart
just
lincoln
mills,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
lincoln
mills
case.
