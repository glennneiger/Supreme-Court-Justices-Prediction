you
request
for
a
stay?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
the
arbitration
provisions
--
are
they
comparable
to
those
in
lincoln
mills?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
--
i
don't
want
this
--
disturb
the
train
of
your
argument
but
i
--
it
would
help
me
if
--
if
i
knew
precisely
what
issues
were
before
the
arbitrator
at
the
time
this
suit
in
the
district
court
was
filed
by
the
employer.
justice
william
o.
douglas
a
joint
agreement?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
guess
that's
the
thing
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
could
--
could
the
union
go
into
court
to
get
an
injunction
against
the
employer
that
may
lock-out
and
directing
the
employer
to
arbitrate?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
--
then
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
total
purport
then
of
--
of
lincoln
mills?
does
it
--
does
that
substitutes
arbitration
for
the
other
--
the
old
system
only
if
the
party
is
voluntarily
wanted?
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
--
i'm
assuming
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
assuming
a
broad
enough
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
contract.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
that
the
injunction
of
the
court
would
be
restricted
to
directing
the
employer
to
--
to
arbitrate.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
suppose
--
suppose
underlying
all
these
was
the
refusal
of
the
union
to
arbitrate,
i
suppose
that
you
would
agree
that
the
injunction
would
run
to
the
union
requiring
it
to
arbitrate,
assuming
that
the
agreement
provided
for
it,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you're
not
asking
for
any
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
in
terms
of
the
--
of
power
of
contempt,
i
suppose
that
would
be
implicit
in
the
--
if
the
court
had
the
power
to
issue
an
injunction,
directing
union
to
arbitrate
and
the
union
didn't
arbitrate.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
--
your
type
of
injunction
if
you
think
would
be
proper
and
the
only
one
as
concerns
the
union
would
be
one
that
directed
the
union
to
arbitrate
and
held
the
union
responsible
for
the
things
that
happened
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
during
the
period
when
the
arbitration
was
supposed
to
be
going
on
that
might
fairly
be
said
to
be
an
indirect
method
of
defeating
arbitration.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
--
i
thought
you've
said
that
you
did
agree
that
it
at
least
repeal
that
in
part
as
far
as
the
injunction
went
to
the
union.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
under
3
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
under
301
i
understood
you
to
say
that
an
injunction,
an
issue
against
the
union
requiring
it
to
arbitrate.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
would
be
a
--
that
--
that
then
takes
something
out
from
what
is
in
norris-laguardia
prior
to
301.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
want
--
you
want
your
cake
and
you
want
to
eat
it,
too.
