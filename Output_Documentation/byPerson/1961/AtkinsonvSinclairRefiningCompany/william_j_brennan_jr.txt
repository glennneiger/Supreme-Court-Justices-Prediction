there

(inaudible)

well,
i
think
(voice

justice

of

the
fact
that
is
--
that
is
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
gather
the
factor
that
this
is
--
they
did
file
(inaudible)

william
j.
brennan,

--
for
arbitration.
justice
william

did

not

well,
if
the

(inaudible)

at

of

(inaudible)
the
question
for
whom
you're
talking
about
(inaudible)
the
matter
to
decide

that's
the
question
(inaudible)
does
the

involve
(inaudible)
pending

and
they
decided
to

to
an

could
such

can
be
made
against
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
page
118
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
but
was
that
the
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
clearly,
that
mr.
christensen,
i
gather
the
court
of
appeals
at
least,
you
asked
alternatively
in
any
event
for
declaratory
judgment,
didn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
does
the
court
of
appeals
had
referenced
to?
i'm
looking
at
39
of
your
petition.
and
it
said
--
when
it
denied
you
declaratory
relief
on
the
ground
that
the
conduct
of
defendants,
count
sets
forth
alternative
conclusions
that
the
conduct
of
defendant
shows
either
that
they
do
not
regard
the
provisions
valid
and
binding
have
deliberately
violated
them.
such
allegation
fails
to
charge
the
existence
of
controversy
of
a
validity
or
enforceability
requisite
to
support
action
for
declaratory
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
didn't
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
live
grievances,
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
this
matter
of
declaratory
judgment
is
out
of
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
christensen,
that
second
count
of
your
rest
only
on
diversity
of
course,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
--
what
law
would
it
to
apply
on
the
matter,
the
substantive
claim?
what
substantive
law?
state
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
a
claim
in
the
first
count
which
is
not
before
us
i
gather,
it's
still
to
be
tried.
that's
against
the
union
for
damages,
isn't
it
under
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
301?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
plainly
federal
law,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
suggest
as
against
the
individuals,
are
these
individuals
officers
or
whatever?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
that
sense,
they
are
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you're
suing
them
in
their
representative
capacity,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
--
are
you
suing
them
as
individuals
allegedly
who
did
things
as
union
committeemen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
--
why
isn't
that
then
suing
in
a
representative
capacity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
suggest
that
state
law
can
govern
that
claim
whereas
federal
law
would
govern
the
claim
against
the
union
as
such.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
that
so,
i
suppose
it's
possible
then
to
say
that
since
we
have
301
then
that
obviously
contemplates
actions
only
against
labor
organizations.
and
indeed
permits
recovery
as
there
is
a
recovery
only
from
the
assets
of
the
labor
organization
as
such
and
to
get
around
danbury
hatters
not
from
the
individuals
that
we
might
conceivably
fashion
federal
law
that
you
couldn't
bring
this
kind
of
action
against
the
individuals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
we
should
be.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
have
to
agree
that
congress
certainly
wanted,
in
an
act
in
301,
to
make
very
clear
that
danbury
hatters
was
no
longer
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
you
get
only
$510
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
--
that
you
asked
for
a
judgment
jointly
and
separately
against
the
individual
defendant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
$12,500
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
cost.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
5000
suppose
that
would
be,
what
(inaudible)
you're
really
holding
them
for
the
damages
that
were
caused
by
the
failure
--
awful
lot
of
breaches
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
put
it
that
way
then,
they
might
have
got
5000
people
afterwards.
it
might
be
a
much
larger
sum
of
20.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
me
quickly
mr.
cornfield,
is
it
your
view
that
there
were
no
live
grievances
that
did
everything
that
involved
in
this
the
way
the
grievances
has
been
resolved
in
arbitration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all
i
--
that's
all
i
want
to
know.
don't
go
into
the
detail.
