mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
this
court
on
the
original
pleadings
fi
--
filed
by
the
employer
in
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
indiana.
in
that
light,
we
must
take
the
pleadings
as
well
pleaded
at
this
juncture
in
the
litigation.
the
original
complaint
filed
by
the
employer
was
in
three
counts.
first
was
a
suit
by
the
employer
against
an
international
union
and
its
local
affiliate
for
breach
of
a
no-strike
clause
of
their
bargaining
agreement
requesting
damages.
the
second
count
was
against
12
local
union
committeemen
for
instigating
and
participating
in
the
alleged
breach
of
the
no-strike
clause.
i
might
say
that
the
allegations
of
fact
against
the
international
and
local
union
in
count
i
were
the
same
as
the
allegations
against
of
the
12
local
union
committeemen
in
count
ii.
count
iii
of
the
complaint
was
against
all
the
defendants,
the
international,
the
local
affiliate
and
the
12
local
union
committeemen.
and
it
was
a
request
for
a
blanket
injunction
operating
into
the
future.
this
point
i
wish
to
comment
that
the
time
the
suit
was
brought
there
was
no
alleged
breach
of
a
no-strike
clause
then
occurring.
i
wish
to
state
the
request
for
the
injunction
contained
in
count
iii
as
against
the
organizations
and
the
individual
defendants.
each
of
them,
their
agents,
servants,
counselors
and
all
to
whom
notice
hereof
may
come
be
enjoined
and
restraint
from
aiding,
abetting,
fomenting,
advising,
participating
in,
ratifying
or
condoning
any
strike,
stoppage
of
work,
slowdown
or
any
other
disruption
of
or
interference
with
normal
employment
or
normal
operation
or
production
by
any
employee
within
the
bargaining
unit
at
the
employer's
east
chicago,
indiana
refinery.
i
might
add
that
the
broad
scope
of
the
requested
injunction
presumably
would
include
new
employees
which
may
be
hired
at
the
plant
in
the
indefinite
future.
i
presume
that
the
employer
would
hand
each
new
employee
a
copy
of
the
injunction
order
along
with
his
employment
application.
the
--
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
these
three
counts.
the
district
court,
after
reconsideration,
dismissed
count
ii,
that
is
the
action
against
the
individual
defendants
and
their
individual
capacities
and
the
requested
injunction
leaving
count
i.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
before
the
recess,
i
had
indicated
that
the
district
court
had
dismissed
count
ii
of
the
complaint
that
is
the
action
against
the
individual
local
officials
and
count
iii
of
the
complaint,
request
for
the
injunction.
case
at
that
point
went
before
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
seventh
circuit.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
decision
as
regards
to
count
iii
and
the
injunction
request
and
overruled
the
district
court
in
its
decision
to
dismiss
count
ii.
i
might
say
that
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
as
to
the
action
against
the
individuals
indicates
that
it
is
the
seventh
circuit's
view
that
the
individuals
might
be
held
responsible
for
breach
of
a
no-strike
clause
if
the
unions
were
not.
now,
in
looking
over
the
employer's
complaint,
sinclair's
claim
for
relief
sounds
deceptively
simple.
and
i
believe
too
many
years
eminently
fair
but
we
submit
that
if
individuals,
local
union
officials
are
to
be
brought
into
state
courts
or
into
federal
courts
under
diversity
of
citizenship
jurisdiction
and
if
the
injunction
requested
here
to
operate
into
the
indefinite
future
is
granted,
a
pandora's
box
of
confusing
litigation
will
ensue
before
federal
and
state
courts.
we
have
argued
rather
extensively
we
believe
in
our
briefs
that
the
net
result
of
the
suit
against
the
individuals
and
the
request
for
an
injunction
is
continuing
conflict
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
to
enforce
and
develop
substantive
law
under
their
powers
granted
by
congress
under
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
furthermore,
the
requested
injunction
not
only
guarantees
the
recurrence
of
such
conflicts
into
the
unforeseeable
future
but
flies
in
the
face
of
the
clear
language
and
the
spirit
of
long
standing
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
that
is
right.
i
believe
that
the
employer
acknowledges
that
individuals
cannot
be
sued
under
section
301
under
the
clear
language
of
that
section
which
allows
suits
only
against
labor
organizations
and
only
against
the
organizational
assets.
going
back
to
the
injunction
request,
if
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
employer's
requested
injunction
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
--
into
the
future.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
against
all
the
defendants,
labor
organizations,
individuals,
their
agents,
counselors,
servants,
etcetera.
i
might
say
this
that
the
employer's
requested
relief
is
--
if
allowed
would
interject
trial
judges
all
over
the
country
into
labor
controversies
forcing
them
to
impose
their
varying
views
and
social
policy
in
an
area
which
properly
must
lie
within
the
discretion
of
congress.
now,
i
would
like
in
this
oral
presentation
to
discuss
the
implications
of
the
requested
relief
by
the
employer.
first,
i
would
to
discuss
count
ii
of
the
complaint,
that
is
the
request
for
damages
against
the
individual
local
union
officials
under
a
tort,
common
law
tort
theory
based
on
joint
and
several
liability.
first,
the
employer
contends
that
we
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
contract
between
the
unions,
that
is
the
international
and
its
local
affiliate,
that
this
contract
contains
a
no-strike
pledge.
the
employer
maintains
that
we
submitted
to
an
arbitration
procedure
and
in
return
we
extracted
from
the
unions
a
no-strike
obligation.
now,
i
might
say
that
the
employer
does
not
mention
also
that
the
unions,
in
turn,
extracted
a
no
lockout
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
employers.
if
there's
a
quid
pro
quo
or
anything
here,
it
is
the
no-strike
and
the
quid
pro
quo
for
the
no-strike
is
the
no
lockout
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
the
arbitration
provisions
set
out
a
grievance
procedure.
they
first
defined
the
grievances
as
covering
all
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
and
then
established
a
grievance
procedure
then
provide
for
arbitration.
there
was
--
this
added
a
clause
in
this
contract
which
is
not
discussed
in
the
employer's
brief.
article
27
of
the
contract
also
provides
for
so-called
"general
disputes"
directly
between
the
highest
level,
the
employer
hierarchy
and
the
highest
level
of
the
international
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
the
employer
after
the
work
stoppage
occurred
docked
the
local
union
committeemen
for
the
time
of
the
work
stoppage
claiming
that
they
were
not
fulfilling
their
responsibilities
as
local
union
officials.
the
employer
also
took
certain
action
against
the
local
union
officials
in
the
form
of
saying
that
"from
now
on,
you
will
not
have
prearranged
to
operate
the
--
around
the
plant
and
process
grievances."
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed
these
grievances
had
been
submitted
to
arbitration
or
at
least
they'd
gone
to
all
the
stages
of
grievance
procedure
and
there
had
been
understandings
to
submit
this
to
arbitration.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
joint
agreement
and
arbitrator
has
not
been
selected
as
yet.
there
is
this
confusion
i
believe,
if
i
might
say,
in
the
employer's
brief.
there
are
two
arbitration
issues
here.
one
is
that
we
request
a
stay
based
on
the
fact
that
the
activities,
if
any,
of
the
local
union
officials
has
been
brought
to
arbitration
by
virtue
of
the
grievances
we
filed.
but
we
also
say
further
as
in
drake
bakeries
that
the
employer
should
initiate
arbitration
against
the
unions
as
to
the
question
of
the
breach
of
the
no-strike
clause.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
that's
right.
i
would
like,
if
possible,
to
reserve
the
question
of
arbitration
to
the
last
since
it's
been
argued
rather
extensively
in
drake
bakeries
and
we
have
--
we
feel
too
rather
important
issues
in
addition
here.
going
on
from
the
contract,
the
employer
says,
"i
negotiated
a
no-strike
clause
with
the
international
and
local
affiliate."
now,
the
employer
argues
that
during
this
contract
term,
a
work
stoppage
occurs
and
it's
participated
in
by
over
half
of
the
plant.
the
employer
alleges
this
complaint
that
999
employees
out
of
the
1700
employees
at
the
refinery
participated
in
this
work
stoppage.
now,
taking
the
complaint
as
well-pleaded,
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
and
the
employer
claims
that
clearly
a
work
stoppage
occurs
and
we
are
entitled
to
fair
relief
for
our
loss
of
production.
and
the
employer
reasons
very
simply
that
clearly
the
courts
--
the
court's
rule
is
to
assure
just
compensation
for
this
loss
of
production.
now,
the
employer
goes
on,
"the
unions
with
whom
we've
bargained,"
that
is
the
international
and
local
affiliate,
"clearly
should
be
held
responsible
for
this
loss
of
production."
so
they
filed
count
i
of
the
action,
a
suit
under
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
act
against
the
unions.
but
the
employer
goes
on
further
than
that.
and
it
hedges
against
future
possibilities.
the
employer
says,
"but
what
if
we
can't
prove
liability
against
the
unions?
a
work
stoppage
occurred.
clearly
we
must
be
able
to
collect
from
somebody."
now,
here's
an
international
organization,
its
local
affiliate,
"we
filed
a
suit
against
them,
whether
we
argue
the
case
in
the
court
or
we
argue
it
before
an
arbitrator,"
all
of
the
arguments
in
drake
bakeries,
"what
if
we
don't
win?
what
if
we
can't
prove
that
the
international
or
--
and/or
the
local
weren't
responsible?
a
work
stoppage
occurs.
we
must
be
able
to
collect
from
somebody."
this
leads
the
employer
to
a
seemingly
logical
conclusion
that
the
employees
themselves
should
be
held
personally
responsible
for
the
stoppage.
now,
the
employer
did
not
choose
to
sue
the
999
employees
because
this
would
apparently
seem
absurd
on
its
face.
the
employer
chooses
to
do
and
say,
"well,
we're
only
going
to
sue
the
employees
who
led
this
work
stoppage."
now,
i
might
say
these
are
the
same
employees
who
are
alleged
the
agents
of
the
international
and
local
union
in
count
i
of
the
complaint.
now,
the
employer
reasons,
"we
can't
bring
this
kind
of
suit
under
section
301
because
clearly
the
employees
themselves,
the
local
union
officials
aren't
labor
organizations.
so,
what
are
we
going
to
do?
but
it
has
to
come
in
the
state
court
someway.
there
must
be
a
common
law
cause
of
action."
this
leads
the
employer
to
america's
feelings
of
anxiety
with
the
old
english
common
law
tort
established
in
lumley
versus
gye.
these
individual,
union
officials
stand
to
the
membership
as
third
parties
who
conspired
to
interfere
with
the
contractual
relationship
of
these
999
employees
and
therefore
they
are
guilty
of
a
common
law
tort.
it
comes
into
the
federal
court
solely
by
virtue
of
diversity
of
citizenship.
sinclair
is
a
foreign
corporation
as
in
terms
of
indiana
and
all
the
individual
members
are
either
citizens
of
indiana,
some
are
citizens
of
illinois.
now,
the
employer
basis
his
argument
on
the
fact
that
if
a
stoppage
occurs,
there
must
be
some
type
of
legal
theory
which
allows
us
to
collect
and
the
employer
then
makes
out
a
seemingly
simple
case
for
relief.
we
submit
that
this
simple
case
of
relief
opens
up
direct
issues
which
are
in
conflict
with
the
principles
of
federal
preemption
established
in
garmon
and
reinforced
very
recently
by
this
court
relative
to
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
dowd
box
and
in
lucas
flower.
lucas
flower
and
dowd
box,
taken
together
along
with
lincoln
mills,
establish
the
principle
that
it's
true
that
state
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
suits
for
breaches
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
but
the
law
that
is
to
be
applied
must
be
substan
--
substantive
federal
law
developed
under
section
301
as
per
set
forth
in
the
lincoln
mills
decision.
now,
we
submit
whatever
chain
of
reasoning
the
employer
chooses
to
follow
establishing
some
basis
of
liability
against
these
individuals,
ultimately,
you're
brought
back
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
being
brought
back
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
there
exist
only
one
cause
of
action
and
that
is
against
the
labor
organizations
themselves
under
section
301.
under
the
lucas
flower
decision,
a
state
court
cannot
entertain
an
action
for
breach
of
collective
bargaining
contracts
that
is
in
conflict
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
under
section
301.
now,
i
would
like
to
demonstrate
that
whatever
logical
position
the
employer
assumes,
you
are
brought
back
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
employer
alleges
that
the
individuals,
the
individual
local
union
officials
conspired,
instigated,
participated
in
breaches
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
this
was
the
original
complaint.
the
employer
felt,
we
believe,
that
this
was
so
blatantly
under
the
jurisdiction
of
section
301
that
the
employer
changed
his
theory
and
said,
"no,
its
not
that
they
conspired
to
breach
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
establishes
999
personal
contracts
containing
no-strike
pledge
by
every
individual
running
to
the
employer."
and
it
is
these,
these
contracts
that
these
individuals
conspired
to
breach
or
instigated
people
to
breach.
now,
if
the
unions
under
count
i,
whether
it's
in
a
district
court
or
before
an
arbitrator,
are
held
not
to
have
breached
the
no-strike
clause,
how
can
any
court
find
that
the
individuals
have
breached
the
no-strike
clause
without
running
into
clear
conflict
with
federal
substantive
law?
either
the
no-strike
clause
has
been
breached
or
it
hasn't
been
breached.
and
if
it
has
been
breach,
it's
a
collective
bargaining
issue
and
it's
a
suit
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract
that
must
come
within
the
purview
of
section
301.
but
the
employer
may
still
assert
that
there's
some
basic
equity
involved
that
a
work
stoppage
occurs
and
we
want
to
be
assured
compensation.
the
employer
argues
that
we
know
we
can
penalize
the
individuals
that
caused
or
participated
in
the
breach.
we
know
we
can
threaten
them
with
this
charge.
we
know
we
can
suspend
them
or
discipline
them.
but
that's
not
enough,
we
want
to
get
money
in
--
under
a
joint
and
several
obligation
theory.
now,
the
employer
says,
"you
see,
if
we
go
into
count
i
and
only
on
count
i,
the
unions
may
argue
that
they
aren't
guarantors
against
every
work
stoppage,
that
we
would
have
to
show
that
they
actually,
the
international
and/or
the
local,
instigated
the
work
stoppage,
the
wildcat."
now,
if
we
can't
show
that,
the
work
stoppage
still
occurs.
i
might
say
this,
if
the
union
is
not
a
guarantor,
it's
a
matter
of
contract
interpretation
whether
they
are
guarantors.
and
if
the
union
is
not
a
guarantor
and
the
unions
are
held
not
to
have
been
responsible
for
the
work
stoppage
that
means
that
there's
been
no
violation
of
a
no-strike
clause.
it's
clear
it
seems
to
us.
if
the
unions
are
guarantors,
then
the
allegations
of
count
ii
are
moot.
there's
no
need
for
them.
the
work
stoppage
occurs,
there's
been
a
breach
of
contract,
the
unions
are
responsible.
if
the
unions
are
responsible,
only
if
they
instigated
the
walk
out,
the
wildcat,
this
is
a
matter
of
contract
interpretation.
now,
let
us
say
that
the
court
would
still
maintain
and
there's
some
theory,
it's
not
lumley
versus
gye,
some
equitable
concept
that
the
employer
is
still
entitled
to
relief.
we
can't
conceive
how
but
let
us
say
this
occurs.
what
are
the
consequences
of
this
type
of
decision?
our
individual
union
officials
then
to
be
forced
to
defend
actions
in
state
courts,
the
employer
indicates
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
bring
suits
against
individuals
whether
or
not
he
has
the
right
to
bring
suits
against
the
unions.
so,
let
us
say
he
didn't
bring
the
suit
against
the
union.
he
just
went
in
to
just
--
the
state
--
the
indiana
state
courts
under
this
tort
theory
and
sue
the
individuals.
does
this
mean
that
the
individuals
have
to
defend
on
the
basis,
"no,
i
was
not
acting
alone.
i
was
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
union"?
you
would
then
be
forced
to
the
position
that
individual,
local
union
officials
could
only
defend
themselves
adequately
in
a
state
court
by
forcing
their
unions
to
be
the
true
party's
defendant.
would
this
mean
then
that
the
unions
would
have
to
take
disciplinary
action
or
expel
these
men
because
they
unduly
charged
their
unions
with
the
violation?
it's
like
a
corporate
official
being
sued
personally
and
say,
"no,
you
don't
want
me.
i
was
only
acting
as
agent
for
my
corporation."
this
would
be
the
type
of
defense.
you're
forcing
this
type
of
local
union
officials
to
submit
to
if
they
have
to
defend
tort
actions
in
state
courts
or
under
the
diversity
of
citizenship
jurisdiction
in
federal
courts.
even
if
a
local
union
official
would
take
the
position
in
a
state
court
that
it
was
the
union's
responsibility,
the
state
court
would
have
to
interpret
was
it
the
union's
responsibly
and
again,
we're
brought
back
to
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
what
is
the
no-strike
clause?
what
did
the
unions
agree
to?
it's
inescapable
it
seems
to
us
that
the
issue
is
a
collective
bargaining
dispute.
and
under
lucas
and
dowd
box,
there
is
nothing
left,
if
there
ever
was,
any
tort
theory
to
be
left
with
the
state
courts.
as
a
final
answer
to
the
question
of
individual
liability,
if
the
employer
truly
believes
his
remedies
are
inadequate.
it
is
not
for
the
courts
to
mold
a
new
bargaining
agreement
to
meet
sinclair
refining
company's
needs.
the
employer
must
return
to
the
bargaining
table
if
the
employer
feels
that
the
no-strike
commitment
was
inadequate,
either
the
employer
believes
the
no-strike
commitment
is
adequate
or
the
employer
does
not.
only
the
employers'
willingness
to
bargain
and
the
unions'
willingness
to
negotiate
will
resolve
this
issue.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
i
would
say
this
that
under
our
arguments
relating
to
norris-laguardia
act,
that
so
long
as
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
still
vital,
it
covers
all
areas
of
labor
disputes.
and
it's
my
understanding
that
if
it
were
a
situation
that
we
came
in
to
court
requesting
an
injunction
against
the
lock-out,
there'd
be
a
serious
problem
under
norris-laguardia
act.
the
same
way
as
the
serious
problem
as
far
as
the
employer
is
concerned
in
--
in
attempting
to
get
an
injunction
against
the
union.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
well,
i
think
this,
your
honor,
that
lincoln
mills
demonstrates
that
the
parties
have
available
to
them
a
multitude
of
remedies
which
they
can
agree
to.
now,
in
the
situation
you
supposed,
let
us
say
that
we
sued
an
employer
for
breach
of
a
no
lockout
clause
then
the
employer
asked
for
a
stay
because
the
issue
should
be
arbitrated,
i
would
say
in
that
case
that
the
employer
would
be
entitled
to
arbitration
if
the
contract
is
broad
enough
to
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
--
to
allow
for
them,
yes.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
yes.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
yes.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
employer
is
locking
out
the
employees
and
we
rush
in
to
court
for
an
injunction
against
that,
there
might
be
a
problem
because
of
norris-laguardia
act.
now,
the
court
could
order
that
the
issue
be
arbitrated
but
there'd
be
a
serious
question
whether
the
court
could
order
the
employer
to
open
up
his
doors
again
because
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
of
prohibitions
against
injunctions
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
--
and
labor
disputes.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
at
this
point,
yes
sir,
if
the
lockout
is
to
be
considered
the
same
as
the
strike.
and
of
course,
i'm
not
arguing
that
issue
at
this
point.
i'm
presuming
that
this
is
implied
in
your
questioning.
going
on
to
the
injunction
question,
the
employer
argues
that
aside
from
the
assurance
of
money
damages,
the
employer
wants
the
courts
to
assure
him
that
work
stoppages,
wildcats
will
not
occur
in
the
future
so
long
as
there's
a
no-strike
pledge.
now,
we
have
pointed
out
that
this
court
is
not
a
proper
forum
or
any
federal
court
for
the
debate
of
social
policy
as
to
whether
norris-laguardia
is
good,
that
the
clayton
act
was
good,
whether
it
should
be
amended.
we
have
argued
extensively,
we
feel
in
our
brief
legislative
history,
the
impact
of
norris-laguardia.
we
have
argued
extensively
the
matters
leading
up
to
norris-laguardia
and
have
analyzed
the
classic
work
on
the
subject
of
labor
injunction
by
frankfurter
and
greene.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
yes.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
i
would
say
this
your
honor
that
the
commitment
regarding
the
lockout
runs
to
the
union.
and
this
is
my
own
view
of
the
matter
that
the
proper
party
would
be
the
union
to
sue.
now,
the
individuals'
claim
i
would
suggest
would
have
to
operate
through
the
grievance
procedure.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
this
is
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
this
is
my
view
of
the
subject.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
this
is
my
view
of
the
subject.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
there
is
no
grievance
procedure
but
there's
no-lockout
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
i
think
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
unions
to
bring
that
suit.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
no.
i
would
say
this
that
if
the
union
did
not
bring
the
suit
and
there
was
a
fair
basis
that
the
suit
should
be
brought
that
the
individual
maybe
able
to
prevail
upon
the
courts
to
force
the
employer's
hand
--
the
unions
hand
rather
at
that.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
yes,
of
some
kind.
now,
you
do
have
this
situation
occurring,
your
honor,
the
westinghouse,
that
there
is
this
area
where
the
court
say,
"well,
individuals
have
certain
vested
very
personal
rights,
like
a
claim
for
back
wages,
they've
been
fired."
and
the
union
shouldn't
be
forced
to
bring
this
type
of
action
as
a
very
personalized
matter.
if
the
individual
was
bringing
the
suit
in
order
to
question
the
validity
of
a
lockout
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
i
would
say
that
the
appropriate
party
is
the
union
because
the
issue
basically
is
the
collective
bargaining
one.
if
there
was
no
question
of
the
lockout
was
illegal
and
this
individual
said,
"well,
it's
been
proven
the
lockouts
been
illegal.
i
haven't
got
my
wages."
this
might
be
considered
a
very
personalized
dispute,
no
longer
a
collective
bargaining
issue.
i
think
what
we
have
to
look
at
here
is
the
issue
raised
an
issue
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
yes
but
the
commit
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
i
submit,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
no-lockout
pledge
runs
to
the
contracting
party
and
the
contracting
party
in
this
case
is
the
organization.
now,
if
we
presumed
that
the
employer,
as
was
said
in
the
drake
bakeries
case,
signs
an
affidavit
that
i
breached
the
no-lockout
clause
and
there's
no
collective
bargaining
dispute
and
the
individual
says,
"i
should
get
money
for
it"
then
possibly
we've
taken
it
out
of
the
area
of
collective
bargaining
disputes.
but
i
think
otherwise,
if
there
is
a
question,
has
the
employer
actually
locked
out
the
employees
or
breached
the
contract
or
if
it
said
the
no
lockout
pledge,
the
appropriate
party
is
the
union.
this
is
my
belief.
otherwise,
i
think
we
will
have
state
courts
deciding
major
collective
bargaining
issues
by
virtue
of
one
individual
filing
an
individual
lawsuit
that
--
that
this
collective
bargaining
contract
has
been
filed.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
i
can't
see
how
your
honor,
because
section
301
provides
for
only
suits
between
employers
and
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
--
labor
organizations.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
of
collective
bargaining
contracts
between
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
--
employers
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
--
and
labor
organizations.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
well,
i
would
say
this,
your
honor,
that
in
this
--
the
way
i
would
interpret
the
import
of
section
301
is
that
if
an
individual
brought
a
suit
for
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
unless
the
individuals
made
a
party
to
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
he
doesn't
have
sta
--
stature
to
be
a
party
to
that
lawsuit.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
as
--
i
would
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
that's
right.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
that's
right.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
a
party
to
the
collective
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
well,
i
think
the
federal
courts
could
make
a
determination
whether
the
individual
is
a
party
to
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
and
if
the
federal
courts
where
to
make
such
determination,
then
the
individual
would
have
a
standing.
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
--
under
section
(voice
overlap)
--
yes.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
yes.
and
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
my
answer
would
have
to
remain,
your
honor
that
if
an
individual
brought
a
suit
for
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
the
first
question
that
would
have
to
be
asked,
"are
you
a
party
to
the
collective
bargaining
contract?"
and
i
would
say
that
an
individual,
unless
he
is
representing
the
party
to
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
is
not
a
party.
he
might
be,
what
we
might
call
a
third-party
beneficiary
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
--
of
some
kind.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
yes,
but
he
--
i
would
say
this
that
he
is
not
bringing
a
suit
for
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
if
that
determination
has
been
made
and
he
says
by
virtue
of
this
breach
of
the
suit
--
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
"i
have
been
deprived
of
certain
wages",
then
i
think
we
no
longer
have
a
collective
bargaining
dispute.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
i
would
say
this,
your
honor
that
i
think
that'd
be
very,
very
unfortunate
if
the
courts
were
to
interpret
section
301
as
to
allow
individual
union
members
to
flood
the
federal
courts
with
suits
of
breaches
of
collective
bargaining
contracts.
there
are
1700
employees
of
this
one
refinery.
i
would
like
to
make
some
general
comments
on
the
injunction
issue.
as
i
was
saying,
i
don't
--
do
not
--
i
think
that
the
norris-laguardia
and
clayton
act
clearly
applies
to
the
requested
injunction
relief
in
count
iii.
but
in
this
part
of
the
oral
presentation,
we
believe
that
it
is
important
to
stress
the
considerations
involved
in
deciding
whether
federal
courts
should
be
allowed
to
embark
upon
this
species
of
injunction.
i
wish
to
remind
the
court
that
there
was
no
work
stoppage
at
anytime
during
the
--
during
the
course
of
this
lawsuit
unlike
in
yellow
transit.
this
injunction
is
only
towards
future
activities
which
have
not
occurred
and
may
never
occur.
now,
the
employer
argues
regarding
norris-laguardia,
the
norris-laguardia
was
never
intended
to
cover
unlawful
labor
disputes.
that's
not
a
question
of
whether
section
301
has
impliedly
repeal
norris-laguardia.
but
in
norris-laguardia,
it
never
meant
to
cover
this
area,
and
that
norris-laguardia
was
concerned
only
with
so-called
"lawful
disputes".
now,
we
concede
in
--
and
this
--
the
number
of
cases
on
this
point.
the
norris-laguardia
wasn't
meant
to
interfere
with
injunctions
where
violence
has
occurred
or
criminal
violations
have
occurred.
but
this
area
of
legality
is
another
question.
now,
we
submit
that
the
employer
misconceives
the
purposes
in
norris-laguardia.
the
clayton
act
was
passed
in
1940.
clayton
act
as
applied
to
labor
organizations
or
labor
disputes
stated
that
injunctions
couldn't
be
issued
in
disputes
between
employers
and
employees.
now,
it's
a
matter
of
history
that
by
and
large,
the
clayton
act
was
interpreted
by
the
court
as
to
be
applied
only
to
legal
labor
activities.
and
by
and
large,
the
courts
before
1932
had
interpreted
the
clayton
act
in
such
a
way
that
said
injunctions
are
only
prohibited
on
those
activities,
labor
activities
that
were
lawful
before
clayton
act.
now,
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
passed
basically
to
cure
this
defect
in
the
clayton
act
that
has
been
interpreted
by
the
courts.
the
classic
work
on
the
subject,
the
labor
injunction
by
frankfurter
and
greene,
the
entire
thesis
of
the
book
is
that
the
need
for
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
because
the
courts
had
been
deciding
that
the
clayton
act
applied
only
to
illegal
disputes.
and
the
entire
thesis
of
the
book
was
that
there
was
a
need
to
stop
injunctions
from
occurring
by
the
courts
in
situations
where
the
courts
would
issue
preemptory
restraining
order
solely
on
employer
affidavits
without
a
hearing.
and
then
several
months
later,
there'd
be
an
argument
of
the
merits
but
by
now,
the
labor
dispute
had
already
been
broken
and
whether
or
not
the
unions
had
a
valid
claim,
had
already
been
vitiated.
i
wish
to
give
an
example
of
the
effect
of
norris-laguardia
act.
let's
take
secondary
boycotts.
before
clayton
act
and
after
clayton
act,
the
courts
by
and
large
held
that
for
unions
to
participate
in
any
form
of
secondary
boycott
was
illegal.
now,
norris-laguardia
did
not
make
secondary
boycotts
legal.
but
after
norris-laguardia,
the
courts
could
no
longer
issue
injunctions
to
restrain
secondary
boycotts.
this
would
allow,
presumably,
employers
to
sue
--
sue
the
unions
or
individuals
for
participating
in
breaches
of
secondary
boycotts
where
there
was
no
labor
contract.
it
wasn't
until
1935
with
the
passage
of
the
wagner
act
that
secondary
boycotts
or
at
least
a
variety
of
them
so-called
were
legalized.
and
here,
you
have
a
joining
of
the
anti-injunction
provisions
and
the
--
the
legalization
of
secondary
boycotts.
now,
in
1947,
congress
held
that
secondary
boycotts,
at
least
a
good
number
of
them,
were
unlawful.
but
congress
did
not
then
simply
say,
"well,
from
now
on,
norris-laguardia
doesn't
apply
and
from
now
on,
you
can
sue."
by
then
there
have
been
established
the
national
labor
relations
board.
congress
allowed
for
restraining
orders
but
had
to
be
done
through
the
procedures
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
to
be
the
initiating
party.
so
that
the
argument,
the
norris
la
guardia,
applies
only
to
so-called
"legal
disputes"
is
clearly
incorrect
in
terms
of
the
history
before
and
after
norris-laguardia
and
the
reasons
for
passing
it.
now,
even
if
we
are
satisfied
that
a
wildcat
that
is,
as
mr.
meyer
in
the
drake
bakeries
argument
adequately
showed,
not
a
strike
for
economic
purposes,
any
kind
of
work
stoppage
that
takes
place
during
the
course
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract
developing
out
of
the
spontaneous
friction
and
interaction
of
employees
and
supervisors.
even
if
we
say
it
is
socially
undesirable,
i
do
not
submit
that
the
answer
lies
in
allowing
the
courts
to
issue
wholesale
injunctions
or
allowing
the
courts
to
exercise
injunctions
preliminary
restraining
orders,
preempting
restraining
orders
on
a
basis
of
affidavits.
what
--
even
if
we
said,
and
as
a
matter
of
social
policy,
that
some
type
of
restraint
should
be
put
on
this
type
of
work
stoppages,
what
are
the
possibilities?
our
restraining
orders
and
contempt
citations
to
run
against
individual
union
officials
as
well
as
members
of
the
organization
and
the
organization
themselves,
the
type
of
injunction
requested
here
would
run
against
organizations,
would
run
against
union
officials,
would
also
run
against
members
and
any
new
employees
that
come
in
the
plant.
do
we
really
mean
that
granting
the
injunction
request
here
would
allow
contempt
citations
to
issue
preemptory
against
all
these
people?
but
what
if
we
say
be
such
an
injunction
should
issue?
does
this
mean
that
a
work
stoppage
occurs
three,
four,
five
years
from
now?
the
employer
comes
running
in
to
court
with
a
contempt
citation
for
this
injunction,
the
employer
has
requested.
the
people
are
out
on
the
street.
this
means
that
if
they
refuse
to
return
to
work,
they
are
then
in
contempt
of
court.
this
would
be
solely
clearly
--
so
clearly
violative
of
thirteenth
amendment,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
discuss
it.
it
would
be
specific
performance
of
personal
service
commitments.
but
what
does
it
mean
to
say
you're
having
an
injunction
running
against
individuals?
then
we
ask
ourselves,
"well,
we
won't
issue
injunction
against
individuals
only
be
against
the
organizations."
what
is
it
mean
to
say
that
the
in
--
organizations
are
enjoin
from
encouraging
strikes?
these
are
wildcats
remember.
in
yellow
transit,
there
was
no
question
that
the
company
called
the
work
stoppages
a
dispute
whether
they
have
the
right
to.
here,
it's
a
wildcat
situation
that
happened
and
has
stopped.
by
its
very
nature,
the
union
maintains
we
didn't
call
it.
this
is
the
nature
of
wildcats.
now,
if
you
issue
the
injunction,
if
the
courts
were
allowed
to
issue
the
injunction
against
the
organizations
against
encouraging
the
wildcats,
does
this
mean
that
a
labor
organization
could
be
held
in
contempt
of
court
if
six
employees
temporarily
refused
to
work
because
of
a
job
assignment
dispute?
73
three
employees
refused
to
work
for
one
hour
because
of
same
type
of
dispute,
24
employees
for
the
same
reasons
for
an
hour
and
a
three
quarters
and
24
employees
again
for
two
hours.
but
these
are
the
allegations
of
work
stoppages
that
are
contained
in
a
plaintiff's
complaint.
this
would
mean
that
the
complaint
--
the
plant
--
the
employer
would
be
allowed
to
run
into
the
local
federal
court
that
issues
the
injunction
and
get
contempt
citation
against
the
organizations
for
everyone
of
these
occurrences.
and
what
about
these
type
of
disputes?
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
disputes
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
oh,
there's
no
question,
mr.
justice
douglas
that
the
employer
has
the
right
to
bring
the
union
in
the
court
and
ask
for
a
specific
performance
of
arbitration.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
that's
right.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
work
stoppages
occurred
and
the
unions
can
be
held
in
contempt
of
court
because
they
occur
is
another
matter.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
yes,
your
honor.
but
what
the
employer
is
requesting
here
is
a
blanket
injunction
operating
into
the
future
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
--
over
any
work
stoppages
that
occur.
now,
it
doesn't
mean
that
because
the
work
stoppages
occurred
that
the
union
is
refusing
to
arbitrate.
the
union
official
may
get
out
in
the
plant
after
they've
already
stopped.
this
size
for
a
dollar
and
three-quarters
and
the
--
in
fact
the
union
may
say,
"stop
if
those
will
arbitrate
the
issue."
but
in
the
meantime,
the
employers
run
into
court
with
a
contempt
citation.
and
as
mr.
meyer
pointed
out,
the
employer's
main
thesis
is,
it's
not
so
much
that
he
wants
the
opportunity
go
into
court
but
he
wants
the
opportunity
to
use
the
threat
of
contempt
citations.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
type
of
injunction
requested
here
would
cover
this
type
of
situation.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
would
say
this
that
the
employer
took
the
matter
to
arbitration,
said
there
had
been
a
work
summon
dispute
and
the
union
brought
them
into
arbitration
and
the
employer
would
indicate
before
the
arbitrator
why
the
employees
were
not
justified
in
refusing
to
take
certain
jobs
because
they
weren't
in
their
job
classification
and
so
forth.
the
union
would
have
to
argue
that
point.
now,
if
the
union
refused
to
arbitrate
this
issue,
i
would
suggest
that
the
employer
could
come
into
court
and
say
if
the
union
should
--
should
go
to
arbitration.
but
let
us
even
think
in
terms
of
this
contempt
citation
that
say
you
have
a
dispute
over
safety
and
employees
spontaneously
refused
to
work
because
the
--
they
felt
that
the
condition
weren't
safe.
under
this
type
of
blanket
injunction
operating
into
the
indefinite
future
the
employer
could
go
into
court
and
say
the
local
federal
court,
not
an
arbitrator,
not
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
say,
"i
want
contempt
citation
against
all
these
individuals
refusing
to
work
and
the
union
organizations.
and
i
must
have
it
immediately
because
my
production,
i
have
orders
to
fill
and
it's
not
--
there's
no
time
for
a
hearing
two
months
from
now."
this
was
a
sort
of
thing
that
now
justice
frankfurter
described
in
his
classic
work
that
existed
before
the
passage
of
norris-laguardia.
the
court
without
any
contrary
way,
the
local
court
will
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
the
action
was
unlawful.
and
then
a
couple
of
months
later
would
--
or
two
or
four
months
later
will
have
a
thorough
hearing
on
the
matter.
or
let's
say
there's
an
honest
difference
of
opinion
regarding
overtime,
the
employer
says
to
a
group
of
employees,
"i
want
you
to
work
overtime
tonight."
the
employees
say,
"i
don't
have
to
work
overtime
under
the
contract."
and
no
one
--
and
everyone
refused
to
work
overtime.
under
this
type
of
injunction,
the
employer
could
go
into
the
local
federal
court,
cite
the
injunction
that
they
--
they
have
and
--
and
get
contempt
citation
against
all
individuals.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
that
if
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
this
would
be
at
a
formal
union
meeting
clearly.
well,
let
us
say
that
an
injunction
issued
against
formal
strike
action
against
the
organization,
this
would
mean
that
the
court
would
issue
an
order
saying,
"do
not
take
such
action,
it
is
not
lawful
under
the
contract."
now
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
the
thing
--
the
point
would
be
this,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
say
the
employees
still
insisted
on
striking,
the
union
issues
a
telegram
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
that
there
would
be
problems
in
norris-laguardia.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
the
farthest
the
court
could
go
would
be
to
issue
an
order
that
the
union
could
not
call
a
strike
but
if
a
strike
occurred,
if
the
people
still
insisted
on
going
out
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
i
would
say
this,
your
honor,
that
if
we
were
to
say
that
a
court
could
make
a
determination
if
they
threatened,
breach
of
the
contract
was
legal
or
illegal
the
court
certainly
has
that
power
to
do
so.
now,
if
the
court
were
to
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
well
that
is
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
the
union
is
about
to
threaten
a
breach
of
the
contract.
now,
if
the
court
went
further
and
said,
"you
cannot
strike."
what
we're
talking
about
is
whether
these
employees
have
the
right
to
leave
the
job.
and
we
again
get
back
to
the
problem
what
does
this
mean
and
who
is
to
effectuate
an
order
that
the
employees
are
not
or
let's
take
a
situation
that
we
have
here
where
it's
a
wildcat.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
i
would
say
this
that
the
--
under
the
norris-laguardia
act,
i
would
suggest
that
the
farthest
the
court
could
go
under
that
situation
would
be
a
declaratory
judgment
of
some
kind
as
to
whether
or
not
a
threatened
strike
was
in
breach
of
collective
bargaining
contract.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
well,
we
again
get
back
to
the
question
of
who
we
--
who
the
court
would
be
restraining.
if
it's
restraining
the
people
from
walking
out,
i
would
say
no.
i
think
(inaudible)
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
that's
right
mr.
justice
black.
but
the
employer
further
contends
that
there
was
no
need
for
repeal
because
the
norris-laguardia
act
never
covered
this
situation.
the
thesis
of
the
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
oh,
not
section
301
but
the
taft-hartley
act
has
repealed
it
in
many
instances
where
you
can
get
restraining
orders
against
unions
for
breach
as
a
secondary
boycotts
and
another
type
of
activities
with
the
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
--
national
labor
relations
board
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
well,
i
--
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
term
was
not
used
by
me
but
by
the
court.
they
could
get
an
order
for
a
specific
performance
to
arbitrate.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
i
don't
suggest
that
this
is
an
injunction
and
i
think
in
lincoln
mills,
it
was
made
clear
that
a
specific
performance
did
not
fall
within
the
purview
of
injunctions
under
norris-laguardia.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
well,
norris-laguardia
contains
specific
provision
encouraging
the
use
of
arbitration
and
this
was
referred
to
in
lincoln
mills.
and
the
thrust
of
lincoln
mills
was
that
ordering
arbitration
was
not
meant
to
be
covered
under
the
norris-laguardia
act.
and
i
think
that
lincoln
mills
made
it
very
clear
that
the
decision
was
not
meant
to
imply
that
there
had
been
a
partial
repeal
of
norris-laguardia
by
virtue
of
section
301.
the
employer
doesn't
rely
upon
that
theory
either.
the
employer
relies
upon
the
theory
that
norris-laguardia
never
covered
these
situations.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
employer
has
the
right
to
force
us
to
arbitration.
the
employer
does
not
have
the
right
to
come
into
court
in
this
instance
and
ask
for
an
injunction
against
all
future
work
stoppages.
and
i
think
that
we
admitted
quite
clear
what
the
implications
of
such
an
injunction
would
be.
and
i
also
further
suggest
that
if
there
is
social
value
in
allowing
this
type
of
injunctions
to
issue
that
is
not
clear
that
the
court
should
be
just
placed
wholesale
back
in
the
injunction
business
that
if
there
--
if
this
country
feels
that
there's
a
social
need
for
some
type
of
restraining
orders,
it's
up
to
congress
to
determine
what
particular
method
of
restraint
that
it
--
is
going
to
exist
and
whether
its
going
to
be
through
the
nlrb
or
through
the
courts.
there
had
been
a
bill
at
the
time
of
taft-hartley
coming
out
of
the
house
that
would
have
made
every
breach
of
no-strike
clause
an
unfair
labor
practice.
this
in
effect
would
have
given
the
board
restraining
powers
by
virtue
of
its
general
powers
to
enforce
unfair
labor
practices.
that
bill
did
not
get
through
the
senate
and
was
not
made
apart
of
taft-hartley.
now,
certain
members
of
the
house
at
that
time
had
felt
apparently
some
type
of
need
for
something
more
than
damage
suits
in
this
area
but
congress
chose
does
not
to
add.
we
feel
wisely.
i
think
at
this
time
that
although
there
are
many
other
issues
involved
in
this
proceeding,
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
--
two
minutes
i
have
left
for
a
reply.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
i'll
be
very,
very
brief.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
oh,
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
--
there
are
still
the
grievance
spending
regarding
the
--
the
counties
against
--
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
--
individuals.
mr.
gilbert
a.
cornfield
alright.
i
just
wish
to
say
this
to
the
court.
it
is
apparent
that
the
so-called
"sued
against
the
individuals",
the
request
for
an
injunction
operating
only
into
the
future
a
blanket
injunction,
mr.
christensen
calls
it
limited
but
it
refers
to
every
contract
in
the
future
between
these
parties
has
concerns.
it
is
apparent
that
the
intent
of
the
employer
is
to
have
federal
trial
judges
supervise
the
day-to-day
operations
of
the
workforce.
i
agree,
this
isn't
the
best
of
all
possible
world,
the
situations
in
the
--
the
mills
and
the
plants
do
not
run
as
smoothly
as
--
as
we
would
like
in
a
fairy
tale.
but
it
is
not
the
place
for
federal
district
judges
at
this
juncture
why
through
contempt
citations
to
be
the
administers
of
the
day-to-day
operations
of
the
workforce.
thank
you.
