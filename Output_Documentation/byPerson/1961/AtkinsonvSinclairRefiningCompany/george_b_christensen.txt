mr.
george
b.
christensen
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
apologize
for
not
being
here
on
time
this
morning.
we
had
decided
to
not
risk
the
vagaries
of
air
transportation
for
the
first
time
and
i
don't
know
how
many
years
the
(inaudible)
limited
was
over
two
hours
late.
that's
why
these
cases
had
to
be
rearranged.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
was
somewhat
doubtful
at
times
as
to
what
case
mr.
cornfield
was
arguing.
it
certainly
was
not
the
case
i
was
in.
now,
to
comeback
to
what
the
court
is
confronted
with
and
what
this
complaint
alleges
or
what
is
admitted
by
the
motion
to
dismiss.
you
had
a
contract
that
had
a
complete
flat
no-strike,
no-stoppage
clause
in
it.
it
had
an
elaborate
grievance
procedure
terminating
in
compulsory
arbitration
in
complete
accord
with
the
policy
expressed
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
that
no
point
in
that
arbitration
procedure
is
there
any
provision
for
the
filing
of
employer
grievances
against
the
union
or
its
member.
secondly,
the
injunction
count,
count
iii
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
i
think
--
i
--
i
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
think
its
in
--
inherent,
your
honor,
because
the
contract
provides
any
grievances
must.
it's
in
mandatory
language
that's
quoted
at
page
4
of
our
brief
in
the
white
cover.
and
at
page
4,
under
grievance
procedure,
the
second
sentence,
"therefore,
when
a
grievance
arises,
the
following
procedure
must
be
followed."
and
that
coupled
with
the
no-strike
agreement
which
appears
on
page
3.
"there
shall
be
no-strike
or
work
stoppages
for
any
cause",
which
is
or
might
be
the
subject
of
a
grievance
under
this
completely
settles
that
i
believe.
as
to
the
injunction
count,
this
complaint
alleges
that
in
a
period
of
approximately
19
months,
there
were
nine
work
stoppages
at
this
refinery.
some
of
them
involving
a
department,
some
of
them
involving
many
employees
or
one,
two
or
three
shifts
as
the
case
might
be.
the
place
was
a
constant
scene
of
irresponsibility
and
turmoil.
and
while
we
are
listening
to
all
this
vague
thought
about
social
benefits
and
about
how
the
law
should
not
be
enforced
and
what
a
harsh
thing
lawsuits
are
and
what
a
evil
an
injunction
would
be.
the
fact
is,
this
does
not
appear
of
record,
but
i
think
the
issue
is
serious
enough
so
that
i
am
entitled
to
say
so
that
since
we
have
had
a
potential
injunction
in
the
form
of
a
lawsuit
pending,
there
has
not
been
any
legal
stoppage
at
that
plant.
now,
i
cite
that
also
because
we
are
going
to
discuss
this
question
of
wildcats.
counsel
says
these
were
all
wildcats,
maybe,
maybe
not.
in
any
event,
the
union,
since
the
pendency
of
this
suit,
has
been
able
to
give
us
effective
discipline
and
uninterrupted
production.
one
never
knows
whether
it
is
a
wildcat
or
is
not
a
wildcat.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
quite
no
more
than
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no
more
than
--
than
any
plaintiff
is
compelled
to
present
any
claim.
it
means
if
they
--
if
they
want
to
settle
that,
contract
means,
as
i
would
read
it,
if
they
want
to
settle
that
grievance
and
they
think
it's
good,
here
is
the
way
to
do
it,
to
set
up
an
arbitration.
they
can't
strike.
they're
absolutely
bound
not
to
strike
and
this
is
the
procedure
they
must
follow.
now
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
i
think
not
only
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
we
could
compel
them
in
what
we
are
seeking
as
to
establish
a
procedure
by
indirection
to
compel
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
presume
that
you
could.
i
don't
know
why
you
would
and
there's
a
very
practical
difference
in
the
situation
of
the
employer
and
the
employee.
we
run
the
plant.
we
have
made
our
managerial
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
they
have
contracted
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
--
not
to
strike
and
if
they
have
anything
they
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
if
they
wished
to
progress
one
of
these
grievances.
if
not,
they
may
abandon
them.
just
the
same
as
--
as
if
i'm
dealing
with
my
grocer
and
he
says
that
i
owe
him
last
month's
grocery
bill
and
i
say
i
paid
it.
i
can't
compel
him
to
file
a
lawsuit.
some
states,
i
could
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
--
file
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
there
is
no
doubt
about
it,
whatsoever.
lincoln
mills
has
clearly
established
that.
they
could
--
they
could
carry
us
right
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
don't
think
that
is
so
unusual,
your
honor,
and
i
think
you
will
find
a
substantially
similar
framework.
this
is
exceptionally
strong,
it
says,
"if
they
want
to
progress
a
grievance,
they
must
use
this
procedure."
and
the
difference
comes
from
the
fact
that
as
to
grievances,
the
situation
of
the
employer
and
the
union
is
totally
different.
here's
a
man
that
says
he
has
a
grievance.
we
say
he
hasn't.
we've
made
our
managerial
decision.
now,
on
the
one
that
led
to
this
particular
thing,
these
three
fellows
have
been
docked,
a
total
of
$2.19
some
73
or
4
cents
a
man.
we
said
they
were
properly
docked.
we
had
made
that
decision.
they
said
we
were
wrong.
if
we
were
wrong,
they
had
the
option
if
they
really
believed
it
to
file
a
grievance
to
prosecute
it
so
far
as
they
wished
through
this
test.
if
they
thought
it
was
no
good
they
could
drop
it
at
anytime.
and
of
course
in
normal
industrial
practice
many
grievances
are
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no
they
did
not.
they
did
not.
the
facts
are
--
that's
why
i
said
that
at
times
i
will
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
they
did
ultimately.
now,
i
can
give
you
the
time
schedule
on
that
your
honor.
first
on
the
so-called
"riggers",
these
three
riggers
who
were
docked,
this
two
--
$2.19
cents,
they
got
a
thousand
people
to
go
out
for
them.
they
--
that
occurred
on
the
13th
and
14th
of
february,
the
dock.
the
riggers
and
then
the
strike,
we've
got
them
back,
the
matter
wasn't
settled.
the
riggers
then
on
march
the
4th,
some
roughly
three
weeks
afterwards
thereabouts,
filed
grievances
that
appear
at
record
35
and
36.
now,
the
next
thing
that
shows
up
--
of
the
record
is
that
on
march
4,
nine
of
the
defend
--
people
who
became
defendants
in
this
lawsuit
filed
grievances
which
appeared
at
record
form
--
record
pages
37
and
38.
they
say
they
were
entitled
to
more
pay
on
the
days
of
the
strike.
the
suit
was
filed
on
march
the
12th.
now,
the
--
the
coincidence
of
these
dates
is
more
than
coincidence.
i
am
quite
sure
that
these
gentlemen
understood
lawyers
were
drafting
papers.
on
march
the
25th,
some
two
weeks
after
the
suit
was
filed,
three
more
of
the
individual
defendants
filed
grievances,
these
committeemen
saying
they
didn't
get
all
their
pay
for
the
days
of
the
strike.
and
on
april
22nd,
two
more
of
them
did
so
that
ultimately,
the
riggers
filed
grievance,
three
fellows
have
been
docked
and
ultimately,
nine
defendants
immediately
before
the
suit
was
filed
and
five
of
them
at
periods
of
two
weeks
to
a
month
and
half
afterward
filed
grievances.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
out
of
24
defendants.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
what
page
is
that,
judge?
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
it's
not
the
fact.
now
the
--
those
affidavits
are
contradicted.
you'll
find
at
page
35
and
36
of
the
record
commencing
at
page
33
is
the
affidavit
of
robert
d.
clark.
and
the
actual
grievances
that
were
filed
are
attached.
no
arbitration
has
yet
taken
placed
and
i
doubt
whether
one
ever
will.
no
umpire
has
been
na
--
named,
no
steps
have
been
taken
to
prosecute
it.
but
there'd
been
no
arbitration
here
and
an
arbitration
board
hasn't
even
been
set
up
and
that
affidavit
is
vigorously
contested
by
the
affidavit
of
mr.
robert
d.
clark
which
is
as
factual
as
we
could
make
it
attaching
the
actual
grievance
forms
that
were
filed.
now,
the
two
issues
that
are
presented
here
is
of
course
one
by
ours
at
the
dismissal
of
the
injunction
count.
the
count
obviously
was
based
upon
and
is
still
based
upon
a
filling
of
a
proclivity
for
illegal
conduct
in
this
particular
bargaining
unit,
nine
illegal
stoppages
in
19
months
demonstrates
the
necessity
for
something.
when
the
case
was
filed,
judge
swygert
originally
overruled
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
injunction
count.
then
this
court
decided
the
north
western
railroad
telegraphers
case.
there
was
a
motion
for
reconsideration.
judge
swygert
believed
that
north
--
the
north
western
telegraphers
case
stood
for
a
blanket
pronouncement
that
under
no
circumstances
in
anything
remotely
smelling
of
a
labor
dispute
could
there
be
an
injunction.
we
think
he
was
mistaken
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief.
and
that
this
case
is
the
counterpart
in
the
industrial
field
of
the
chicago
river
and
indiana
case
in
the
railroad
field
that
you're
governed
by
the
railway
labor
act.
now,
in
railway
labor,
you
have
the
so-called
"major
disputes"
that
the
parties
are
free
following
process
of
mediation
to
do
what
they
please
and
go
on
out
on
strike
if
they
can't
agree.
and
you
have
the
so-called
"minor
disputes"
concerning
terms,
applications,
contracts
of
employment
that
they
are
at
liberty
to
take
to
the
railroad
adjustment
board
and
have
determined
precisely
the
situation
that
is
provided
here
in
the
industrial
field
by
a
contract
providing
for
binding
arbitration
and
that's
precisely
what
happened
here.
these
were
all
that
disputes.
the
complaint
so
alleges
and
the
motion
to
dismiss
so
agrees.
if
norris-laguardia
does
not
stand
in
the
way
of
enjoining
strike
and
illegal
action
for
minor
disputes
under
railway
labor,
a
fortiori
it
should
not
be
held
to
do
so
on
--
in
the
industrial
field
under
labor
management
relations
act
because
the
1947
amendments
spoke
so
strongly,
not
merely
in
section
301
but
in
203
in
the
various
other
places,
are
the
desirability
of
having
contracts
that
are
substantially
like
this
one,
with
a
no-strike
clause
or
no-lockout
clause
with
grievance
procedure
ending
in
compulsory
arbitration.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i'm
using
it
in
the
sense,
your
honor
they
can
compel
us
to
arbitrate.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
and
i
am
thinking
always
in
the
terminology
that
the
fellow
who
brings
the
grievance
is
the
employer
or
his
agent
because
the
management
has
the
right
to
make
the
working
decision.
it
makes
at
its
peril
as
to
whether
it's
right
or
wrong
but
it
has
made
its
decision.
here,
it
was
to
dock
three
guys,
guide
74
cents
a
piece.
but
whatever
it
maybe,
the
--
the
position
of
the
parties
in
this
grievance
matters
is
--
is
not
the
same
because
the
employer
can
fire
a
man
if
he
thinks
he's
been
bad
enough
or
suspend
him
or
whatever
he
does.
and
when
i
use
compulsory
arbitration,
it
was
in
the
sense
that
the
grievant
could
compel
the
employer
to
submit
to
and
accept
the
results
of
arbitration.
now,
we
make
an
argument
in
here
that
i'm
not
going
to
burden
the
court
for
trying
to
recite
the
cases
because
i
probably
couldn't
and
i
think
you
will
want
to
read
them
more
closely.
prior
to
the
adoption
of
norris-laguardia,
there
weren't
too
many
cases
because
contracts
of
this
nature
of
course
we're
not
so
general
in
as
they
are
now.
but
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
discover,
there
was
never
any
question
that
in
no
lockout,
no-strike
contract
could
be
enforced
by
injunctive
relief
either
against
strike
or
against
lockout.
and
the
courts
held
such
contracts
were
commendable.
we
had
one
in
illinois,
(inaudible)
workers
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
it
had
a
compulsory
arbitration
provision
in
it
and
a
no-strike,
no-lockout
clause.
that
case
was
decided
in
1931.
there
were
a
series
of
cases
in
new
york
in
the
1920s.
there
was
never
any
question
during
the
very
heated
norris-laguardia
debates
over
the
wisdom,
the
social
soundness
and
the
legality
of
those
decisions
in
that
limited
field.
that's
all
i'm
talking
about.
now,
it's
perfectly
true
that
a
great
deal
of
ingenuity
from
some
very
agile
minds
went
into
drafting
the
definition
of
labor
dispute
that
is
contained
in
the
norris-laguardia
act.
and
i
would
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
say
that
you
can't
take
that
sweeping
definition
of
back-end
of
the
statute.
and
dialectally,
you
can
read
it
to
cover
nearly
anything
you
can
think.
but
this
court
through
the
virginia
railway
case,
through
the
chicago
river,
indiana,
through
lincoln
mills
as
gradually
been
holding
that
the
definitions
of
norris-laguardia
are
to
be
read
in
the
light
and
against
the
evils
it
was
aimed
to
--
to
cure.
roughly,
they
were
the
stifling
of
organization.
now,
no
labor
union
has
ever
had
a
right,
constitutional
right,
common
law
right,
any
kind
of
a
right
to
violate
a
contract
that
it
is
freely
entered
into
as
a
result
of
collective
bargaining.
it's
grossly
illegal
conduct.
it
does
the
country
great
harm.
norris-laguardia
by
none
of
its
proponents
was
ever
intended
to
legalize
that
type
of
conduct
nor
to
takeaway
a
beneficent
remedy
that
would
stop
it
because
you
may
have
all
the
talk
you
want,
all
we
can
sue
this
union,
we
can
do
this
or
that.
no
court
in
the
land
including
this
high
can
restore
lost
production.
no
amount
of
damages
you
could
give
this
employer
for
an
illegal
strike
would
compensate
the
innocent
employers
who
were
involved
in
nearly
every
illegal
strike
that
takes
place.
and
there
is
nothing
heinous
or
unfair
or
socially
undesirable
about
stopping
an
illegal
course
of
conduct
before
it
goes
too
far
and
brings
about
that
irreparable
damage
that
no
one
including
this
high
court
can
ever
cure.
there
is
no
real
answer
to
our
injunction
prayer
here
except
for
counsel
to
assert,
"oh,
what
a
horrible
thing.
there'll
be
contempt,
perpetual
injunction
running
on,
we
didn't
ask
for
that."
we
ask
only
one
single
thing.
we
used
enough
words
so
we
hoped
we
didn't
leave
any
loose
ends.
but
we
asked
only
one
thing,
an
injunction
against
any
further
strikes
or
stoppages
over
matters
which
could
and
if
valid
might
be
submitted
to
arbitration
under
this
contract
grievances
falling
within
this
contract.
it
couldn't
go
out
on
strike
over
that
either
under
this
contract
or
any
renewal
or
extension
of
it,
that
had
be
identical
or
substantially
the
similar
language.
now,
to
the
extent
that
we
asked
for
one
beyond
the
then
life
of
the
then
contract,
we
were
reaching
into
the
future
in
accordance
with
what
i
think
are
generally
recognized
the
facts
that
these
contracts
generally
and
this
one
in
particular
provide
for
renewal.
and
they
usually
are
renewed.
the
basic
framework
of
many
of
these
contracts
stays
the
same
year
after
year
after
year
for
grammar
ambiguous
clauses
and
everything
else
because
anyone
who's
anything
experience
with
collective
bargaining
knows
that
changing
some
simple
little
thing
in
there
is
the
hardest
thing
in
the
world
to
do
and
it's
about
as
broad
as
it
is
long.
this
injunction
was
not
a
sweeping.
the
injunction
prayed
for
was
not
broad
or
sweeping.
now,
let
me
go
to
the
damage
comment.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
your
honor,
with
due
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
don't
understand
that
anymore
than
you.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
and
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
apparently,
i
--
i
don't
know,
but
we
were
faced
with
this
problem
when
we
sought
to
come
here,
that
we
wanted
certiorari
granted
and
we
didn't
want
to
bring
up
too
many
questions
and
we
brought
up
only
the
injunction
question
on
our
petition.
the
question
isn't
opened
here.
it
hasn't
been
briefed.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
out
of
the
case
here.
we
--
we
did
not
raise
it
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
we
thought
if
we
came
up
here
with
too
many
questions
that
we
might
not
fair
so
well
upon
our
petition.
now,
i
go
from
our
injunction
count
on
which
we
asked
you
to
grant
certiorari
to
the
union
side
of
the
case
and
they
are
complaining
over
the
fact
that
the
court
has
held
that
we
state
a
good
action
at
law
against
the
24
committeemen.
and
again,
with
your
permission,
let
me
be
pretty
practical.
the
problem
that
is
presented
here
is
a
very
real
one.
you
have
had
congressional
hearings
on
what
has
happened
at
the
missile
bases,
or
unions
have
said
they
can't
control
their
men
but
there
have
been
these
stoppages
that
have
been
deadly
serious
to
the
national
welfare.
you
have
plants
such
as
this
one,
not
typical
of
sinclair's
operation,
praise
the
lord,
but
typical
for
a
time
of
this
plant
of
nine
stoppages
in
some
19
months.
you
have
one
that
i
happen
to
know
something
about
because
it's
occurring
right
now.
a
plant
of
about
some
800
men
and
i
suspect
in
this
case,
what's
going
on
is
a
--
is
a
political
ruction
within
the
union,
very
responsible
union
supposedly.
but
800
men
walked
out
of
that
plant
in
chicago,
friday
and
they
haven't
been
back
yet.
they're
--
i
haven't
been
at
a
telephone
this
morning,
i
don't
think
they
are
back.
and
in
that
case,
we
have
filed
a
suit,
and
the
union
lawyers
told
us
there
yesterday,
"we
aren't
going
to
put
in
an
appearance
for
those
rascals.
they're
out.
if
they
want
to
defend
against
that
suit,
they
will
have
to
defend
it
themselves."
slightly
different
from
the
situation
here
which
is
why
i
say
that
a
court
and
an
employer
is
entitled
to
look
with
some
degree
of
skepticism
at
the
complaints
that
all
of
these
wildcats
are
wholly
the
work
uninstigated
and
unapproved
by
the
union
that
may
hold
title
to
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
in
our
brief,
we
set
forth
what
some
students
have
said
about
the
number
and
volume
of
so-called
"wildcat
strikes".
they
continue
in
great
number
throughout
the
country.
that's
perfectly
apparent
that
the
illegal
remedies
thus
far
used
had
not
been
successful
or
the
evil
would
have
been
abated
a
long
time
ago.
yet,
they
continue.
so
you
come
down
to
meet
the
legal
propositions
that
are
urged
here.
they
say,
"oh,
don't
sue
these
men,
don't
sue
these
men,
sue
the
entity."
and
this
whole
existence
of
the
entity
is
as
the
agent
or
the
man.
no
union
can
go
out
on
a
strike.
it
takes
live
people
in
a
factory
minor
meal
to
leave
their
place
of
employment
and
go
out
on
a
strike.
no
union
per
se
can
possibly
breach
a
no-strike
contract.
only
people
can
do
it.
and
the
cases
are
legion
that
the
committeemen
of
a
union
have
a
special
sense
of
responsibility,
arbitrator
after
arbitrator
says,
"it's
alright
to
pick
on
them
if
you
have
one
of
these
things
and
they
go
out,
fire
them."
it's
a
pretty
harsh
remedy
in
a
good
many
cases.
that's
a
pretty
difficult
remedy
in
a
good
many
cases
because
you
might
pick
the
wrong
man
and
you
end
up
with
the
labor
board
proceeding
against
you
and
an
order
to
reinstate
them.
that
is
not
necessarily
so
bad
in
and
of
itself
if
the
man
is
entitled
to
reinstatement,
he
should
be
reinstated.
but
the
fact
that
you
have
been
--
have
just
wrong
and
have
been
compelled
to
do
it,
gives
you
a
bad
name
with
your
employees
that
you
have
a
hard
time
living
down
for
many
years.
it
said,
"penalize
this
people.
well
now
take
the
situation
that
my
office
is
concerned
within
chicago
today,
800
people
out
on
an
illegal
strike."
now,
who
are
we
going
to
penalize
there?
let's
say
they
are
out
the
balance
of
this
week.
we've
lost
a
week's
production
at
a
time
when
we
need
production.
are
we
then
going
to
penalize
ourselves
another
week's
production?
we
can't
run
the
plant
without
them.
or
these
24
men
that
we
have
sued
here,
said,
"well,
give
them
a
month's
layoff."
well
now
despite
our
differences
of
opinion
with
them,
it
may
be
assumed
they're
pretty
good
competent
workmen
and
that
they're
doing
a
good
job
in
fulfilling
valuable
service,
should
we
deprive
ourselves
of
train
--
24
trainmen
occupying
responsible
positions
in
a
refinery
where
you
need
trained
people?
the
factory
makes
that
for
all
this
talk
about
the
disciplinary
powers
that
an
employer
has
the
proof
of
reporting
this
that
they
don't
work
very
well.
they
work
so
poorly
and
the
threat
of
them
rest
so
lightly
upon
the
conferences
of
people
inclined
to
make
trouble
that
we
have
nine
stoppages
in
19
months
at
this
plant.
but
with
the
rather
mild
threat
of
this
lawsuit,
which
if
you
divided
the
damages
up,
we
prayed
amongst
these
defendants
that
would
amount
to
i
think
$510
a
piece
if
my
arithmetic
is
correct,
i'm
not
--
if
i
were
wrong
with
it.
anyone
of
those
men
i
think
could
pay
that
$510
and
without
too
much
effort
cause
refinery
workers
are
pretty
well
paid.
peace
has
been
restored.
i
don't
think,
your
honors,
if
i
were
to
exhaust
my
whole
time,
unless
there
be
some
questions
that
you
have
to
ask
of
me,
i
could
bring
anything
to
this
that
you
have
not
already
considered.
my
argument
has
have
been
pretty
much
down
to
earth
to
try
to
give
the
court
in
--
i'm
afraid
a
little
rough
and
ready
fashion,
the
real
social
production
problems
that
exist
behind
this
thing
and
the
seriousness
of
this
issue.
this
notion
that
working
men
can
be
the
beneficiaries
of
a
contract
whether
you
adopt
the
theory
that
they
are
a
third-party
beneficiary
or
that
they
are
the
actual
party
to
the
contract
which
has
been
made
by
their
collective
agent.
that
they
are
not
bound
by
that
contract
and
that
their
breaches
should
be
ignored
as
a
legal
matter,
which
is
the
position
that
the
afl-cio
amicus
brief
here
takes
and
seems
to
be
the
position
that
mr.
cornfield
is
taking
this
afternoon,
is
one
that
would
be
destructive
of
all
stability
in
industrial
relations.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
it
is
so
stated,
it
need
not
--
it
need
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
we
proceeded
on
the
theory
that
we
would
go
upon
--
upon
state
law.
i'm
not
at
all
sure
we
were
right.
you
can
bring
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
correct.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
right.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
correct.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
they
are
committeemen.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
not
in
the
sense
that
by
suing
them
we
are
binding
the
organization.
we
are
suing
them
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
we
are
suing
them
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
having
the
powers
of
union
leadership,
they
did
these
things
and
were
able
to
exercise
an
influence
on
leading
people
out.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
it
--
it
--
i
think
it
is.
i
--
i
didn't
want
to
--
in
answering
your
question,
we
aren't
suing
them
as
a
representative
of
the
organization
to
bind
the
organization.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
--
i
am
not
at
all
sure,
justice,
that
we
are
correct
about
that.
i'm
not
at
all
sure.
a
case
this
count
could
just
as
well
as
not
have
been
founded
upon
301.
now,
we
all
learn
as
time
goes
on
and
there
has
been
a
lot
learned
about
301
since
this
complaint
was
drafted
some
three
years
ago.
i
would
not
draft
it
this
way
again.
and
it
seems
to
me,
it's
inevitable
from
lucas
and
dowd
that
you
are
going
to
hold
that
a
suit
for
breach
of
a
contract
must
be
determined
by
federal
law.
you
--
you
passed
that
in
lincoln
mills.
now,
when
you
get
to
interference
with
that,
we're
suing
these
people
in
a
combined
equity
in
law
theory
or
combined
theory
here
of
breaching
their
own
individual
contracts
and
inducing
others
too.
i
don't
see
in
logic
any
stopping
point
to
that
theory
nor
should
there
be.
i
would
think
that
tortuous
interference
of
the
contract
would
have
to
be
decided
by
this
body
of
federal
law
that
the
court
is
creating
roughly
build
around
301.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
--
the
answer
to
a
question
saying
conceivably
has
to
be
yes.
the
answer
to
a
question
is
to
what
you
are
likely
to
do
or
should
do
is
no.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
now,
you
--
you're
--
you're
faced
basically
with
the
proposition,
are
you
going
to
hold
that
--
that
a
collective
contract
containing
a
no-strike
clause
is
binding
upon
the
employees
who
were
the
beneficiaries
of
it.
if
you
answer
that
it
is
not
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
correct,
correct.
now,
and
under
--
under
count
ii,
whether
you
consider
it
as
determined
by
federal
law
or
state
law,
under
count
ii,
those
individual
defendants
will
not
suffer
a
danbury
hatters
fate
if
we
prevail.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
because
we
get
--
we
get
only
a
judgment
against
men
that
we
can
prove
participated,
not
a
danbury
hatters
whole
conspiracy
thing
where
you
bring
him
in
and
they're
responsible
for
everything.
danbury
hatters
doesn't
come
into
this
or
the
evils
of
danbury
hatters
under
any
theory
that
i
could
conceive
of
that
could
apply
to
count
ii,
federal
or
state.
there
is
no
danbury
hatters
evil
in
this
case.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
now
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
what's
wrong
with
that?
if
you've
got
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
no
we
don't
say
a
awful
lot
of
people
to
show
up
for
work.
we
say
in
here
and
we'll
prove
this.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
to
be
as
to
john
or
henry.
these
people
let
them
out
of
the
plant,
took
them
out.
this
isn't
the
drake
bakeries
case
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
sir,
and
the
sum
of
money
--
the
sum
of
money
rises
only
with
the
evil
of
their
own
conduct.
now,
if
they
let
out
so
many
people
at
such
a
critical
time
that
they
did
these
things,
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
they
like
any
other
man,
could
not
be
responsible
for
his
evil
acts.
well,
i
thank
the
court
for
extension.
