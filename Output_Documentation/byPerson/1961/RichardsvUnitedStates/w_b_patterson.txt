mr.
w.
b.
patterson
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
let
me
start
out
by
this
question
you
just
asked.
it's
our
impression
that
the
law
of
oklahoma
and
the
law
of
the
state
of
missouri
are
identical
and
that
is
a
release
of
one
joint
tortfeasor
or
one
tortfeasor
releases
all
tortfeasors
unless
it's
specifically
excluded
from
the
release.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
that's
right.
we
contend,
of
course,
there
has
been
satisfaction.
we
don't
think
that
is
the
precise
problem
before
this
court
in
this
instance,
but
it
certainly
--
well,
i
am
sort
of
--
in
representing
my
client
in
an
anomalous
position
here.
i
--
i
don't
want
my
client
to
have
pay
$15,000
or
$300,000
when
we've
already
paid
and
discharged
our
liability
under
the
state
of
missouri.
i
think,
as
has
been
suggested
here,
that
the
(inaudible)
problem
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
was
to
waive
the
government's
immunity
where
they
theretofore
had
an
immunity
and
make
them
liable
just
like
a
private
individual
would
be
under
the
same
circumstances.
i
think
that
is
the
clear
purpose
of
the
act.
our
position
in
this
regard,
we
do
not
question
the
position
of
the
government.
we
think
their
position
is
logical
and
we
think
if
you
stick
to
the
tenant
advanced
by
petitioners
here
that
you
must
look
at
the
strict
language
and
follow
that,
then
the
position
of
the
government
is
the
only
position
which
the
court
logically
takes.
in
other
words,
if
you
look
to
this
phrase
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred
and
say
now
that
is
clear,
it's
unequivocal,
we
won't
look
any
further,
we
won't
look
to
any
other
phrase
in
the
act,
we'll
just
pick
out
that
one
phrase
and
we
must
do
this.
but
then,
by
the
same
token
of
words
to
say
the
liability
is
the
same
as
that
of
a
private
individual
under
the
law
of
the
place,
you
wouldn't
under
that
rule
of
strict
interpretation
write
in
the
internal
law
or
the
substantive
law.
you
would
look
to
the
entire
law
under
your
rule
of
strict
construction.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
that's
true,
your
honor.
well
i
--
i
mean
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
well,
we
--
we're
certain
at
all
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
well,
that's
precisely
what
i
was
trying
to
say.
maybe,
i
wasn't
saying
it
very
good
but
that's
exactly
what
--
what
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
no.
when
i
say
that
when
they
said
law,
they
may
at
law
and
they
didn't
mean
to
divide
it
to
half
into
groups
of
the
internal
law
or
extraterritorial
law.
when
we
say
the
law,
well
we
mean
the
ordinance
is
in
the
case
laws
and
the
statutes
would
mean
the
law.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
that's
right.
that's
precisely
our
position.
now,
as
i
say,
we
have
no
quarrel
or
whatever
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
that's
right.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
i
have
an
alternative
position
because
i
say
i
want
to
present
my
clients
from
having
stayed
here
and
as
my
(inaudible)
have
been
here,
i
have
no
altruistic
motives
really
in
that
regard.
[laughter]
my
alternative
position,
i
think,
is
equally
as
logical.
in
fact,
it
may
clear
a
little
difference
to
me
in
which
the
court
accepts
the
result
will
be
the
same.
but
my
alternative
position
is
when
you
say
that
the
government
that
shall
be
liable
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
would
be,
when
you
read
that
language,
the
only
way
you
can
do
that
is
to
send
them
to
the
place
where
the
injury
occurred
because
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
--
where
their
injury
or
the
death
occurred.
american
airline
is
sued
in
the
courts
of
oklahoma
for
this
very
act.
the
oklahoma
courts
would
have
interpreted
the
rights
of
american
under
the
missouri
statute
because
the
deaths
occurred
in
missouri.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
let
me
discuss
that
just
a
moment,
by
just
reading
from
some
questions
asked
before
the
congressional
committee.
i
--
it's
our
theory
that
congress
wasn't
dealing
with
the
conflicts
problem.
they
were
designated
that
instead
of
having
a
local
law
and
--
and
still
having
a
body
of
federal
law,
we
are
going
to
have
to
apply
the
local
laws
and
that
is
the
distinction
they
were
making
by
the
use
of
the
phrase,
act
or
omission.
now,
here
is
the
question
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
that's
right.
and
as
i
say,
i'm
not
questioning
the
government's
position
if
you
want
to
take
that
additional
step.
you
get
to
the
same
place
if
you
accept
either
of
these
rules
of
constructions.
what
you
have
said
originally,
you're
going
to
determine
it
by
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
death
occurred
or
while
you
say
you're
going
to
look
to
the
conflicts
rule
which
in
turn
will
send
you
there.
you
get
to
the
same
spot
in
this
case
and
i
think
almost
every
case
judge.
i
believe
that
--
i
believe
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
but
they
don't
judge.
but
they
don't.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
well
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
would
you
expose
that
and
if
that's
true
then
we
wouldn't
raise
this
result,
but
i
think
you'll
find
the
rule
in
48
or
49
states
to
be
just
exactly
the
same.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
yes.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
with
reflect
--
with
respect
to
the
conflicts
problem
your
honor?
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
no,
sir.
i
think
the
general
rule
and
almost
the
universal
rule
is
that
the
liability
as
determined
by
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
injury
occurred
where
the
tort
became
a
tort.
i
think
that
is
an
almost
universal
rule,
for
instance,
a
death
in
the
state
of
missouri,
it
applies
to
missouri
law
no
matter
what
state
court
tries.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
your
honor,
i
think
you
are
in
error
in
that
thinking
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
i
think
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
i
know
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
that
in
effect
is
what
i
do
but
it
is
not
what
i'm
saying
that
you
should
do.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
congress
never
intended
the
word
act
or
omission
to
have
a
thing
in
the
world
to
do
with
this
particular
problem.
let
me
--
let
me
read
you
judge
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
yes,
alright.
judge,
let
me
read
you
this
--
this
one.
here's
from
the
hearing
on
page
9
in
this
thing,
“where
does
the
claimant
file
a
suit?
the
suit
is
to
be
brought
in
the
district
court
in
several
districts
where
the
claimant
resides
--
either
where
the
claimant
resides
or
in
the
locale
of
the
injury
or
death.”
now,
that
is
in
the
hearings
before
congress
on
that
thing.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
that's
true.
but
i
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
that
--
that's
true,
your
honor.
you
are
certainly
right
about
it
but
i
say
that
this
does
lend
some
credence
to
the
argument.
that
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
that
--
that
is
true,
your
honor.
and
i
agree
with
it
thoroughly
and
i
say
that
the
only
way
that
you
can
give
effect
to
that
is
to
make
the
government
liable
in
the
same
manner
as
a
private
individual
would
be.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
are
in
there
for
--
i
don't
think
(voice
overlap)
but
they're
in
there.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
but
to
me
if
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
i
ignore
them
by
saying
that
they
say
that
the
government
is
to
be
liable
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
would
be.
to
place
--
and
i
think
that
is
what
they
meant
to
do,
is
to
make
the
government
liable
just
like
a
private
individual.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
alright,
a
private
--
a
private
individual
would
be
liable
not
for
negligence
under
the
place
where
it
occurred
or
where
the
accident
occurred.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
yes,
you
would.
well,
you
wouldn't
have
to
ignore
which
you'd
have
to
say
that
they
had
a
different
meaning
from
what
they
are
(inaudible)
place
of
death.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
in
other
words,
your
honor,
i
sort
of
believe
what
you
can
say
or
what
i
tell
you
that
sort
of
argument
but
it's
not
quite
yet
at
large
and
when
you
reached
the
same
result
in
any
event.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
against
the
american
airlines?
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
you're
expecting
over
american
airlines
alone?
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
they
would
apply
that
law
of
the
place
--
of
the
place
where
the
death
has
occurred
and
the
law
of
missouri
would
be
applicable
as
to
american
airlines.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
yes
sir,
but
federal
act
doesn't
apply
to
american
airlines.
tort
claims
act
applies
throughout
the
government
as
i
understand.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
same
result.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
in
this
case,
that's
right.
and
i
think
you'll
get
that
same
result,
your
honor
in
about
48
or
49
(voice
overlap)
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
(voice
overlap)
i'm
sorry
if
i
did,
that
was
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
the
jurisdiction
(inaudible)
gets
me
on
diversity.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
that's
right.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
i
think
i'm
probably
correct
in
that.
now,
there
has
been
some
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
--
languages
in
some
of
their
opinions
where
they
say
that
minority
view
exists.
i
--
i
just
don't
find
any
of
those
cases
that
sustain
any
minority
of
view.
so
--
and
as
i
say
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
or
it
became
answerable
where
there
was
a
tort.
there
is
no
tort.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
that's
right.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
that's
right.
now,
a
great
deal
of
talk
has
been
here
about
the
eastern
air
lines
case
and
in
that
connection
i'm
sure
your
honors
are
familiar
that
we
don't
know
what
the
majority
of
the
court
held
in
the
eastern
air
lines
case.
the
dissenting
judge
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
no,
they
didn't
say
that,
your
honor.
they
held
that.
they
didn't
say
anything.
the
dissenting
judge
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
eastern
air
lines
case.
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
and
he
said
that
my
brother
has
been
indicated
so
and
so
and
then
he
went
on
(inaudible)
they
weren't
right.
so,
as
to
what
the
majority
of
the
court
in
the
eastern
air
lines
case,
i
actually
thought
by
reason
of
taking
it
from
the
opinion,
we
can't
do
that
because
there
is
no
--
mr.
w.
b.
patterson
oh,
yes.
it
is
substantially
that
as
judge
miller.
it
is
exactly
said
by
judge
miller
who
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
eastern
case.
the
counsel
has
talked
about
certain
limitations
and
conditions
on
the
part
of
the
government,
imposed
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
well,
certainly,
there
are
these
limitations
or
conditions.
but
how
in
the
world
that
the
words
‘act
or
omission'
constitute
a
limitation
or
a
restriction
or
how
could
it
take
anything
from
the
government
or
give
it
to
a
private
indivi
--
i
just
--
i
cannot
myself
follow
the
logic
in
there.
in
a
particular
case,
if
you
interpret
it
the
way
they
want
to
do
it,
it
might
be
to
the
benefit
of
the
plaintiff
in
one
case
and
the
government
in
another.
in
another
state
it
might
not
be
that
this
will
be
dependent
on
where
he
was.
so,
i
cannot
see
that
those
words
place
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred,
constitute
any
restriction
or
limitation
on
the
government's
liability.
they
simply
say
that
regarding
--
as
the
government
liable
just
like
a
private
individual
and
we're
going
to
do
that
by
applying
the
law
of
the
state
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
i
think
that's
all.
