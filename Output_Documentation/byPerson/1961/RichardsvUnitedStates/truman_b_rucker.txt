mr.
truman
b.
rucker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
federal
tort
claim
act
and
the
particular
area
of
collision
is
between
the
government
on
one
hand
and
the
american
airlines
takes
a
slightly
different
position
and
that
we
represent
the
people
here,
is
with
reference
to
section
1346
(b).
it's
really
a
very
narrow
point,
a
very
narrow
issue
and
it
is
simply
where
the
negligent
act
of
the
government
occurs,
in
this
instance,
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
the
accident
and
injury
or
in
this
instance
the
death
occurred
in
the
state
of
missouri
which
law
applies.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
is
and
if
in
my
argument,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
followed
too
closely
the
argument
of
the
government
in
the
union
trust
case,
it's
only
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
more
persuasive
than
we
have
been
today
in
maintaining
their
position
in
that
case
and
the
fact
that
we
consider
their
position
in
that
case
quite
logical
and
a
common
sense
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
in
1955
and
as
i
say,
i'll
make
this
very
brief,
an
american
airlines
plane
crashed
in
the
state
of
missouri,
killing
everyone
aboard.
now,
i
only
want
to
mention
this
because
i
want
to
get
away
from
it.
in
other
words,
it's
not
here
involved.
during
a
period
of
time
of
a
year
or
so,
the
american
airlines
settled
with
or
had
hindered
into
court
as
i
understand
it,
the
amount
of
their
responsibility
to
the
widows
and
the
dependants
whom
we
are
here
representing.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
now,
within
the
time
limitation
set
by
the
federal
tort
claim
act,
there
were
lawsuits
filed
in
the
district
court,
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
oklahoma,
alleging
that
under
the
oklahoma
wrongful
death
act
that
the
people
that
we
represented
were
entitled
to
damages
against
the
government,
we
made
no
records
to
the
law
of
missouri,
against
the
government
because
of
an
alleged
and
for
this
argument
admitted,
negligent
act
of
the
government
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
now,
as
i
say,
i
only
mentioned
american
airlines
because
i
want
to
get
away
from
it.
it's
not
here
involved
in
this
appeal.
the
government
interplead
the
american
airlines
and
we've
gone
along
up
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
with
this
very
notable
exception
which
was
decided
in
the
union
trust
case
and
which
really
gets
to
the
crux
of
the
argument
because
it
reads,
the
section
reads
where
the
united
states,
if
a
private
person,
would
be
liable
to
the
claimant
in
accordance
with
the
law
or
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred
and
our
problem
here,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
is
basically
to
determine
what
those
words,
if
anything,
mean.
and
we
are
adopting
the
argument
of
the
government
in
the
union
trust
case,
we're
adopting
the
dissent
of
chief
judge
murrah
in
our
circuit
case,
in
which
substantially
he
takes
the
position
that
if
they
intended
to
bring
into
meaning
the
conflict
of
rules
law
and
they
meant
to
restrict
it
to
the
liability
of
a
private
person.
they
could
have
very
well
put
a
period
after
that,
and
therefore,
all
of
the
conflicts
of
rule-law
would
have
come
in
to
effect.
the
district
judge
sustained
the
decision
of
the,
i
will
call
them
the
defendants,
first
that
oklahoma
wrongful
death
act
did
not
have
an
extraterritorial
provision
and
second
assuming
that
we
did
have
any
rights
that
they
had
received
or
had
been
tendered
the
$15,000
and
for
that
prior
practical
reason
had
been
extinguished.
we
appealed
it
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
majority
of
the
circuit
court
did
not
adopt
one
phase
of
the
government's
argument
which
appears
in
the
second
--
in
the
concluding
paragraph,
in
which
they
take
the
position
that
since
under
the
oklahoma
wrongful
death
act,
there
is
no
extra
--
extraterritorial
provision.
then
in
effect,
the
people
that
we
represent
have
no
remedy
against
the
government
because
under
those
circumstances,
a
private
person
would
not
have.
the
majority
rejected
that
and
in
substance
more
or
less
amended
our
complaint
and
said,
“we
will
then
look
to
the
missouri
law
because
if
a
private
person
under
oklahoma
law
had
been
involved
in
an
accident
in
missouri,
in
which
they've
caused
the
death
of
a
person
and
proper
service
could
have
been
obtained
on
them
in
oklahoma
then
the
law
of
missouri
would
have
applied.”
now,
chief
judge
murrah,
in
his
dissent
took
the
position
which
gets,
as
i
say
mr.
justice
whittaker,
it
gets
to
the
crux
of
the
matter.
it
says
they
are
liable,
that's
true,
as
a
private
person,
but
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
negligent
act
or
omission
occurred.
now,
what
does
that
mean?
does
that
mean
we're
going
to
take
into
consideration
the
ordinary
conflicts
of
law
rule?
the
majority
of
our
tenth
circuit
said
this,
“and
this
court
is
committed
to
the
rule
that
where
wrongful
death
occurs
in
one
state
and
an
action
for
damages
is
instituted
in
another,
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
the
wrongful
death
occurred,
not
that
in
which
the
action
was
instituted,
controls
in
respect
the
maximum
amount
of
damages
that
can
be
recovered,”
with
that
we
would
agree.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
if
that
--
that's
just
exactly
the
point
judge
and
we
--
for
some
reason,
for
which
i
assume
our
inability
that
you
must
confess
our
lack
of
success
up
to
this
point
and
that's
the
reason
i'm
following
--
ultimately,
we'll
follow
the
government's
argument
in
the
union
trust
case,
for
some
reason,
we
have
been
unable
to
get
pass
the
mental
block
of
--
when
the
act
is
read,
where
the
united
states,
if
a
private
person
would
be
liable
to
the
claimant
and
for
some
reason,
we
can't
get
by
that.
in
other
words,
we
can't
keep
the
district
judge,
learned
though
he
may
be
and
the
majority,
though,
we
were
able
or
at
least
judge
murrah
felt
differently
to
place
an
interpretation.
in
other
words,
basically
we're
down
to
this.
i
may
not
be
quite
logical,
but
i'm
at
least
trying
to
follow
this
idea
down.
the
federal
tort
claim
act
was
for
many,
many
years
under
consideration
by
the
government.
if
i
get
my
months
wrong,
it's
not
too
important
but
i
think
that
basically
it
seems
to
me
it
was
passed
in
the
79th
congress
and
in
the
77th
which
held
the
last
hearings
on
it.
and
there
was
after
these
years
of
study,
placed
along
towards
the
very
last,
this
phrase
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
now,
that
gets
down
to
this.
what
if
anything
does
that
mean?
we
can
only
believe
that
congress,
at
all
the
times
i
assume,
i
know
at
least
in
this
instance,
had
the
benefit
of
the
largest
and
probably
the
finest
law
firm
in
the
country.
we
must
assume
that
they,
as
well
as
congress,
was
aware
of
the
general
conflicts
rule.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
there
are
two
things,
of
course
one
which
is
unfavorable
and
one
which
is
favorable.
one
which
is
testimony
of
mr.
shea
in
which
he
referred
to
the
locale
where
the
damage
occurred,
however,
it's
interesting
that
in
the
written
memorandum
and
we
operate
on
the
third,
it
won't
be
right
to
write
it
more
carefully
than
one
who
speaks,
more
particularly,
he
spoke
right
after
this
particular
phrase
was
placed
on
and
after
to
the
claimant.
so
as
to
that,
i
think
that
our
argument
could
be
a
bit
more
sounder,
but
be
that
as
it
may
the
--
we
must
assume
that
the
congress
and
the
attorney
general's
office
were
aware
of
the
general
conflicts
of
law
rule
first
and
they
were
likewise
aware
as
chief
justice
murrah
pointed
out
that
there
are
few
if
any
states
that
have
an
extraterritorial
clause
in
the
wrongful
death
act.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
well,
it
is
of
course
involved
here.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
well,
of
course,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
if
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
well,
i
would
be
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
no,
sir,
and
it
likewise
confuses
me.
now,
the
point
i
make
is
that
when
congress
placed
in
this
law
giving
this
remedy,
they
intended
that
the
law
of
oklahoma
was
going
to
apply.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
well,
in
other
words
that
means
the
law
of
oklahoma
except
the
general
conflicts
rule.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
because
of
this
fact.
we
must
assume
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
general
conflicts
rule
and
if
they
intended
the
general
conflicts
rule
to
come
into
play,
then
they
could
have
very
easily
said,
where
the
united
states
if
a
private
person
would
be
liable
to
the
claim
because
then
they're
putting
the
united
states
in
the
position
of
a
private
person.
in
other
words,
that's
all
that
need
to
be
said.
we
must
remember
this.
now,
basically
--
unfortunately
for
the
government,
fortunately
for
them
in
the
union
trust
case,
this
act
not
only
gives
remedy,
but
basically
it
has
a
great
number
of
limitations
if
i
may
say
so.
in
other
words,
the
united
states
government
just
didn't
turn
people
loose.
this,
we
believe,
is
one
of
the
limitations,
one
of
the
conditions
and
as
to
apply
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
it
is
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
(voice
overlap)
condition
or
limitation.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes
sir.
yes,
with
--
with
certain
limitation
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
--
and
conditions.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
alright,
let's
just
name
some
of
them.
i'll
just
take
the
number.
it's
needless
for
me
to
tell
you
but
at
least
one
of
the
greatest
to
my
mind
was
that
they
eliminate
the
trial
of
a
jury.
they
say
that
we're
not
liable
for
cost,
for
interest
under
certain
circumstances
not
liable
for
assault
not
liable
for
battery
and
not
liable
for
number
of
things.
in
other
words,
they
wish
to
place
conditions
on
that.
i
--
and
if
there
be
some
question
as
to
why
which
has
been
raised
in
the
past
as
to
why
they
decide
they
want
the
law
of
the
state
where
the
negligent
act
or
omission
occurred
to
govern.
the
government
in
the
union
trust
case
and
their
memorandum
filed
in
this
court
in
opposition
to
the
writ
has
probably
stated
better
than
i.
more
--
moreover
adherence
to
the
liberal
mandate
and
natural
meaning
of
the
clause
has
the
sensible
advantage
of
adopting
the
law
of
the
state,
(a)
in
which
the
federal
employee
is
located
and
it's
controlled
by
his
superiors;
(b)
which
determines
the
applicable
standard
of
care
governing
the
federal
employee;
(c)
which
fixes
the
rights
and
privileges
of
the
actor
and
(d)
which
results
in
greater
simplicity
and
certainty.
now,
whether
they
are
now
of
course
take
the
position
and
if
it
will
be
well
argued
that
it
would
be
more
simple
to
do
it
the
other
way
and
follow
the
law
of
where
the
accident
occurred,
we
can
only
assume
this
is
more
logical
and
more
accurate
as
this
was
the
position
of
the
department
which
was
advisory
to
congress
at
the
time
that
this
phrase
was
placed
on
this
act.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes.
in
other
words,
their
--
i
think
if
i
may
at
this
time
which
is
more
or
less
in
answer
to
your
question,
although
it
maybe
a
somewhat
lengthy
one
but
to
try
to
answer
that
question.
i
think
we
should
--
first
let
me
--
before
i
get
to
it
if
i
may
because
--
before
i
get
into
this
other
point
why
my
time
may
have
expired,
we
have,
and
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court
has
spoken
in
the
dalehite
case
and
still
i'm
not
answering
your
question
in
and
i
hope
you
don't
think
i'm
avoiding
it.
i'm
really
putting
it
off,
but
as
to
the
interpretation
of
this
particular
clause
which
was
added
on
to
after
the
claimant.
in
the
dalehite
case,
though
it'd
be
an
extent
a
--
and
dissent,
it
was
said
the
law
which
by
statute
determines
the
government's
liability
is
that
of
the
place
where
the
negligent
act
or
omission
occurred.
this
fertilizer
was
manufactured
in
our
way
in
missouri
then
shipped
to
texas
and
speculation
is
to
where
the
negligence
occurred
is
unnecessary
since
each
of
these
jurisdictions
recognize
the
general
proposition
that
a
manufacturer
is
liable
for
defects
in
his
products
which
could
have
been
avoided
by
ordinary
care.
so
then
at
least
we
could
say
that
some
members
of
this
court
started
off
with
the
premise
that
the
law
by
which
the
statute
determines
the
government's
liability
is
that
where
the
place
of
the
negligent
act
or
omission
occurred.
now,
we
have
two
or
three
other
cases,
the
hess
case
which
was
reversed
on
other
grounds,
the
only
reference
that
is
made
to
it
at
this
court,
where
the
ninth
circuit
disagreed
with
the
union
trust
case.
and
they
said
this
case
does
not
involve
--
this
court
said,
“this
case
does
not
involve
the
question
that
would
be
presented
if
wrongful
conduct
occurring
within
the
territory
of
one
political
entity
caused
injury
or
death
within
a
different
political
entity
and
see
the
union
trust
or
the
eastern
air
lines
case
which
is
rather
closely
intermingled.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
i
beg
your
pardon,
you're
right.
the
--
the
marshall
case
which
i
was
thinking
about
did
come
from
the
ninth
circuit
which
came
awfully
close
to
the
same
point,
but
as
the
government
pointed
out
in
their
brief
and
as
we
agree
in
that
particular
instance,
there
was
a
question
of
this
ammonia,
a
terrible
explosive
being
mislabeled
in
utah
and
shipped
to
idaho
and
which
law
would
apply
and
the
fact
that
the
omission
to
use
care
occurred
in
idaho
as
well
as
utah.
so
basically,
we're
down
to
what
might
be
called
a
conflict
as
between
the
tenth
circuit
with
chief
judge
murrah
dissenting
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
with
justice
miller
dissenting.
i
--
now,
let
me
just
outline
the
facts
as
to
so-called
eastern
air
lines
and
union
trust
case,
which
i
think
will
probably
bring
me
up
to
the
noon
hour
and
then
i
will
try
to
at
that
time
answer
the
question
that
has
been
propounded
--
the
best
i
can.
the
eastern
air
lines
or
the
union
trust
case
was
simply
this.
the
union
trust
case
was
an
executor
of
the
man
who
was
killed
on
an
eastern
air
lines
plane.
the
plane
crashed
in
the
district
of
columbia.
there
was
a
suit
instituted
against
eastern
airlines
and
against
the
united
states
government,
alleging
negligence
on
the
part
of
both.
it
developed
that
the
negligence
of
the
government
was
in
the
state
of
virginia,
which
by
oklahoma
had
no
extraterritorial
clause
in
their
death
act,
but
which
like
missouri
and
this
is
the
only
difference
between
the
cases
as
we
have
seen
them,
virginia
had
the
limitation
which
helped
the
government
and
missouri
in
this
instance
has
the
limitation
which
helped
the
government.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
there
was
no
limit
as
to
death
action.
a
judgment
was
rendered
in
the
amount
of
$50,000
against
both.
without
going
up
or
down
with
eastern
air
lines,
except
--
let
me
say
this,
that
the
eastern
air
lines,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
reversed
with
the
ultimate
analysis,
they
finally
paid
the
$50,000
and
the
judgment
was
rendered
against
them
in
that
amount
because
there
was
no
death
limitation
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
there
is
where
their
negligence
and
where
the
damage
and
the
injury
occurred
in
the
district
of
columbia.
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
although
it
was
conceded
that
the
accident,
injury,
the
death
occurred
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
act
or
--
the
negligent
act
or
commission
occurred
in
the
state
of
virginia.
so
then
there
was
raised
squarely
at
this
point.
in
other
words,
what
if
anything,
do
these
words
mean
that
were
placed
on
1346
(b)
which
were
used
in
other
places,
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
in
other
words,
it's
difficult
for
me
i
assumed
maybe
those
more
learned
than
i
can
answer
them
to
get
away
from
the
argument
or
opinion
of
judge
murrah
when
he
says
“why?”
in
other
words,
by
nearly
stopping
there
and
putting
a
period
where
the
united
states,
if
a
private
person
would
be
liable
to
the
claimant,
then
you
don't
have
the
conditions,
you
don't
have
the
limitations.
you
are,
as
far
as
this
particular
part
of
the
law
is
concerned,
placing
the
government
in
the
position
of
a
private
person.
but
although
it
was
--
as
justice
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
the
basic
intent
of
the
act
took
place
in
the
position
of
a
private
person,
yet
that
is
not
what
they
did
because
they
put
on
it
limitations
and
they
put
on
it
conditions
and
this
is
one
of
them.
now,
as
i
say,
we
are
willing
to
accept
the
“why”
as
advanced
for
the
government
in
the
eastern
air
lines
or
rather
the
union
trust
case
operating
on
the
theory
as
i
do,
that
they
--
as
advisory
to
congress
probably
knew
more
about
it
than
anybody
else.
whether
that
is
more
logical
or
more
sensible
approach
for
somebody
to
determine
other
than
myself,
but
at
least
that
was
placed
there
and
can't
we
assume
it
was
placed
there
for
a
reason?
in
other
words
this
court
said
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
after
the
district
court
of
--
the
district
of
columbia
had
rendered
this
judgment
for
$50,000
against
the
government,
the
government
appealed
to
the
court,
which
has
to
do
with
our
conflicts
of
law
problem.
and
in
the
brief
which
we
have
largely
copied,
they
say
that
the
trial
judge
having
found
that
the
collision
occurred
in
the
district
of
columbia
applied
the
district
law
in
measuring
the
government's
liability.
in
doing
so,
he
purported
to
follow
the
general
conflicts
rule
which
in
most
instances
disregards
the
place
of
the
negligent
act
or
omission
and
instead
uses
the
place
for
the
harmful
force
takes
effect
upon
the
body.
this
appeal,
nevertheless,
permits
no
occasion
for
examining
into
the
difficult
problem,
and
i
want
to
get
into
this
business
which
i
really
don't
understand
too
well
except
it
is
a
serious
problem
of
the
application
of
the
general
rule
nor
does
the
case
have
to
be
remanded
for
additional
factual
findings
because
congress
has
foreclosed
the
matter
by
prescribing
a
different
rule
in
the
act.
the
act
requires
application
of
the
place
“where
the
act
or
omission
occurred,
this
provision
is
clear
and
without
ambiguity.”
then
as
to
the
reasons
which
they
had
previously
given
as
to
why
the
government
is
in
a
better
position
because
of
this
where
they
would
have
control
of
the
employee,
the
act
and
so
forth.
they
say,
“the
act
and
omissions
to
the
federal
employees
having
and
occurred
in
virginia,
the
law
of
that
state
must
be
applied
under
the
virginia
law
applicable
as
to
the
date
of
the
accident,
they're
limited
to
$15,000.”
the
court
of
appeals
with
one
judge
dissenting,
held,
they,
the
majority,
hold
that
congress
does
provide
an
explicit
terms
for
the
government's
liability
to
be
measured
under
the
law
of
the
place
where
its
negligent
employees
after
omission
occurred
and
therefore
the
act
requires
the
law
to
be
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
first,
the
government's
brief
and
this
second
was
page
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
--
80
of
221
f.2d.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
in
this
instance
sir
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
our
eastern
--
the
fact
as
i
say
briefly,
the
government's
negligent
act
occurred
in
virginia.
the
act
--
negligent
act
and
the
collision
occurred
in
the
district
of
columbia.
so
the
liability
of
the
eastern
air
lines
was
fixed
under
the
laws
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
government,
were
able
to
persuade
this
court
that
their
liability
was
placed
upon
the
--
it
was
fixed
by
the
laws
of
virginia.
now,
the
precise
question
was
raised
by
the
attorneys
representing
the
deceased
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
where
he
says,
“even
if
the
majority
adhered
to
the
liberal
interpretation
of
the
tort
claims
act
requiring
that
virginia
must
govern
the
extent
of
the
government's
liability,”
it
is
the
entire
law,
entire
virginia
law,
including
its
conflicts
rule
which
must
be
applied.
the
virginia
conflicts
rule
requires
virginia
to
recognize
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
collision
occurred,
hence,
the
district
of
columbia
law
must
be
applied.
now,
the
government,
in
response
to
that
petition
for
rehearing
says,
“in
construing
the
statute,
we
must
start
with
the
presumption
that
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
used
in
the
act
expresses
the
intent
of
congress.”
this
is
from
the
government's
brief
again
which
i
say
we've
largely
copied.
here,
the
ordinary
meaning
dictates
a
rule
which
differs
from
the
general
conflicts
rule.
then,
again
on
page
15,
they
say,
which
gets
to
the
crux
of
the
matter
in
which
we
adopt
and
which
we
have
in
our
brief,
appellees
argued
that
if
virginia
law
is
applicable
then
its
conflicts
rule
must
be
accepted.
and
that
they
say
would
refer
us
to
the
place
of
injury
which
appellees
assume
as
the
district
of
columbia,
the
argument
if
accepted
would
in
effect
increase
the
renvoi
doctrine
which
has
little
support
in
this
country
side.
in
any
event,
here
again
the
explicit
language
of
the
tort
claims
act
given
its
ordinary
meaning
precludes
abandoning
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
the
act's
point
of
reference
is
the
internal
law
of
that
state,
not
its
conflicts
rule,
which
may
carry
us
to
the
law
of
another
state,
which
in
turn
may
invoke
the
law
still
another
state,
coming
to
rest
family
in
a
situs
other
than
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
the
losing
party,
the
attorneys
for
the
deceased
in
their
attempt
to
get
into
this
court,
raised
the
precise
question,
we
have
that
it
would
alter
the
long
established
conflict
of
rules
law,
applying
the
law
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
government
in
their
successful
response,
not
only
cite
the
reasons
which
--
and
actually
adopt
because
they're
favorable
but
i
think
there's
a
logical
person
that
we
can
adopt
when
they
say
that
they
want
these
things
determined,
where
they
know
the
law
of
that
state
and
where
the
actor
is
and
where
they
have
control
of
them,
we
must
operate
on
the
assumption
that
the
attorney
general's
office
had
some
purpose
in
saying
that
was
included.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
well,
in
this
particular
instance,
if
your
honor
please,
they
are
--
may
i
say
to
--
back
home,
we'd
say
they're
somewhat
ingenious.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
well,
i
guess
so
judge,
but
as
i
say,
i
can
only
adopt
their
argument
for
two
reasons.
first,
i
think
its
sound;
they
were
in
on
this
bill.
they
knew
more
about
the
legislative
history
than
anybody
in
the
world
when
he's
arguing
this
union
trust
case.
we
operate
on
the
assumption.
they're
honest
which
we
know
they
aren't.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
well,
i
will
--
i
follow
that
in
this
case
but
in
the
union
trust
case
judge,
i
would
disagree
because
i
consider
them
to
be
honest
and
when
they
knew
the
meaning
of
this
phrase
which
they
were
responsible
and
had
something
to
do
at
least
given
the
government
legal
--
i
mean
the
congress
legal
advice,
they
certainly
knew
what
he
was
doing
at
that
time
and
certainly
knew
what
he's
doing
when
they
took
the
position
that
they
did.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
sir?
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
sir.
i
mean
to
me
as
judge
--
in
response
to
judge
frankfurter,
i
--
i
didn't
want
to
really
say
what
i
thought
[laughter]
but
how
--
well,
i
don't
know.
it
probably
explains
it.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
but
basically,
we're
down
to
this
judge
with
seriousness.
in
other
words,
here
in
--
their
memorandum,
in
our
position
to
the
writ,
they
say
here,
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
clause
dictates
a
rule
which
differs
from
the
general
conflicts
rule
and
i
think
that
is
the
sensible
construction
of
the
act.
now,
excuse
me
if
i
interrupted
you.
i
am
not
sure
that
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
judge,
let
me
say
this,
mr.
chief
--
i
mean
mr.
justice,
may
i
say
this
in
all
seriousness?
as
a
lawyer
who
studies
these
opinions,
if
this
accident
would
have
occurred
in
oklahoma
and
the
negligence
of
the
government
would
have
occurred
in
missouri.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
then
we
would
have
an
identical
situation.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
as
we
had
in
the
union
trust.
in
other
words,
the
accident
occurring
in
oklahoma,
there
has
no
death
limitation,
the
negligent
act
of
the
government
in
missouri.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes
sir.
that's
all
we
allege.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
because
that's
where
it
all
was.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
sir.
and
here
is
the
answer
to
it.
in
other
words,
if
it
was
the
intension
of
congress
that
we
would
have
the
normal
conflicts
of
rule
of
law
then
it
would
have
been
completely
unnecessary
to
have
added
these
words,
which
are
a
condition
or
a
liability
or
restriction.
now,
you
asked
me
earlier
if
i
recall
about
history
and
there's
one
thing
i
wanted
to
point
out
with
reference
to
that.
they
had
originally
in
the
act
which
is
indicative
of
their
thinking,
if
such
be
necessary,
any
claim
arising
in
a
foreign
country
in
behalf
of
an
alien.
it
was
deleted
with
this
phrase
claims
arising
in
a
foreign
country
have
been
exempted
from
cost
resolution
whether
or
not
the
claimant
is
an
alien.
since
liability
is
to
be
determined
by
the
law
of
the
situs
of
the
wrongful
act
or
omission,
it
is
wise
to
restrict
the
bill
to
claims
arising
in
this
country
because
here
in
other
words,
if
we
did
not,
if
the
general
conflicts
of
rule
law
was
in
full
force
in
effect
then
you
could
have
a
negligent
act
in
this
country
and
an
accident
in
another
country
and
the
end
result,
you
would
have
a
situation
that
that
government
didn't
want
or
you
could
assume
that
the
situs
of
the
negligent
act
was
in
a
foreign
country
and
therefore,
the
government
would
have
been
exposed
to
the
act
--
to
the
law
of
some
foreign
country.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
well,
if
i
can
understand
your
honor's
question,
i'll
answer
it
as
fairly
as
i
can.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
oh,
yes,
yes.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
but
here,
that
would
involve
a
situation
other
than
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
well,
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
well,
then
i
see
that
we
would
have
no
choice
under
the
reading
of
this
act.
it's
not
what
i
would
like
--
or
not
like
to
do
but
under
the
reading
of
the
act
and
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
of
course,
that's
the
same
situation
we
had
in
union
trust.
in
other
words,
i
feel
that
--
that
under
the
--
the
reading
of
the
act,
the
natural
meaning
of
the
words
and
history
of
the
act
as
well
as
the
interpretation
of
the
act
put
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
that
where
the
act
or
the
negligent
act
of
the
government
occurs
in
missouri
that
that
is
the
law
that
governs
and
--
and
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
i
–
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
if
--
if
i
was
being
intellectually
honest
and
in
following
what
i
determine
the
law
and
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
well
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
sir,
to
a
point.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
--
here
--
excuse
me.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes
sir.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
alright
sir,
now,
i
think
that
is
an
appropriate
illustration
and
i
will
answer
to
the
best
i
can.
in
other
words,
if
congress
had
stopped
when
they
said
private
person
then
you
would
have
no
problem
as
between
the
government
and
american
airlines
because
under
the
law
of
oklahoma,
a
private
person,
the
general
conflicts
of
rule
law
come
into
force
and
effect.
basically,
that's
what
we
have
to
determine.
so,
you
would
have
the
law
of
oklahoma
and
no
jury,
if
i
may
say
so,
and
few
other
things.
let
me
say
that
the
injured
or
the
deceased
representatives
don't
get
against
the
government.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes,
alright,
the
law
of
oklahoma
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
the
law
of
missouri
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
the
identical
situation,
except
in
reverse,
that
you
had
in
the
union
trust
case.
in
other
words,
you
have
for
example
a
trial,
a
jury
determining
the
issues
as
far
as
american
airlines
is
concerned,
the
judge
determining
the
issues
as
far
as
the
united
states
government
is
concerned,
the
law
of
oklahoma
would
apply
to
the
united
states
government
and
the
general
conflicts
of
rule
law
coming
into
effect
would
apply
to
the
american
airlines.
now,
as
i've
said
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
you
did
in
union
trust.
in
other
words,
you
had
--
in
union
trust,
they
were
able
to
recover
50,000
against
the
eastern
air
lines
and
15
against
the
government
or
it
was
50
and
reduced
to
50.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
yes
sir.
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
--
as
you
say,
when
you're
in
to
the
hypothetical
--
it
was
--
after
answering
this,
i
would
like
to
save
the
time
which
i
apparently
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
alright,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
few
minutes
i
have
left
mr.
--
mr.
truman
b.
rucker
--
chief
justice
warren,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
effect
of
the
reasoning
which
they
are
trying
to
argue
and
enforce
here
is
that
the
end
result
is
that
the
law
of
the
state
where
the
accident
occurred
is
going
to
be
applied.
now,
whether
you
did
or
as
it
has
been
suggested
by
a
rewording
of
the
statute
or
otherwise,
they
are
getting
the
same
result
when
they
bring
into
play
the
conflicts
of
law
rule
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
in
other
words,
it
is
making
meaningless
these
words
“where
the
act
or
omission
occurred”.
now,
then
we
get
to
involved
in
this
situation
as
has
been
suggested
that
if
these
suits
were
commenced
in
missouri,
the
missouri
law
under
their
reasoning
would
look
to
the
law
of
oklahoma
where
the
negligent
act
occurred.
and
oklahoma
conflicts
rule
would
apply
the
law
of
missouri
as
to
the
place
where
the
accident
and
death
occurred.
then
we're
in
to
the
renvoi
theory
and
doctrine
and
that
it
was
obviously
the
intent
of
congress
to
avoid
this
statute
of
conflicts
on
conflicts
which
you
do
not
have
in
the
case
of
a
normal
private
individual.
basically,
we're
down
to
the
feeling
in
the
statement
as
it
was
expressed
in
this
steal-in
case
that
we
should
make
congress
to
respect
of
not
assuming
likely
that
it
indulges
in
inconsistencies
of
speech
which
makes
the
english
language
meaningless.
in
all
respects,
the
government
didn't
expose
themselves
to
the
liability
of
a
private
individual
and
in
the
most
basic
or
the
fact,
they
did
not
give
them
the
right
of
a
trial
to
jury
and
eliminated
many
of
the
other
rights
that
you
have
as
individuals.
so,
basically,
if
you
follow
their
reason
by
applying
the
oklahoma
conflicts
of
law
rule,
then
you're
for
practical
purposes,
eliminating
the
words
“the
act
or
omission
occurred”
because
you're
right
back
there.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
words
were
put
in
there
for
some
reason
and
that
it
was
a
good
reason
and
for
that
reason,
they
should
be
given
full
force
and
attack.
thank
you.
