now,
does
that
mean
all
the
law
of
oklahoma
or
just
some
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
why
--
why
do
you
accept
that?
justice
potter
stewart
hess
came
from
the
supreme
court
of
oregon?
justice
potter
stewart
not
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
where
were
you
reading
from
earlier,
the
government's
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
--
from
the
opinion
of
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
--
would
this
really
avoid
the
kind
of
trouble
that
you
very
interestingly
just
told
us
about
that
you
ran
into
in
eastern
air
lines
case.
what
if
in
that
very
case
the
facts
had
been
reversed
--
the
states
have
been
reserved,
the
jurisdiction
so
that
the
government's
negligent
act
occurred
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
airlines'
negligence
and
the
injuries
occurred
in
virginia?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
some
of
the
states,
are
they
not
or
i
am
mistaken
which
under
their
own
wrongful
death
statutes
provide
that
if
death
has
occurred
--
death
is
inflicted
somewhere
else
by
negligence
--
by
negligent
act
occurring
within
the
state
then
the
law
of
the
home
state
should
prevail.
are
there
any
such
statutes?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
i
--
i
certainly
agree
with
what
you've
just
implied
that
the
desirable
thing
is
to
have
these
questions
settled.
justice
potter
stewart
there
seemed
three
points
of
view
at
least.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
don't
quite
understand
why
just
in
the
abstract
quite
apart
from
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
matter
in
this
lawsuit.
why
in
the
abstract,
one
of
these
three
rules
is
philosophically
or
symmetrically
or
jurisprudentially
superior
to
the
other
two
as
contrasted
with
the
desirability
of
--
of
making
the
rule
whatever
it
is
certain?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
some
fairly
respectable
judges
have
deferred
about
this.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
to
the
case
like
defamation
then
the
law
will
be
quite
different,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mwell,
that's
precisely
the
government's
position
and
--
and
you're
saying
you
have
no
quarrel
with
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
have
an
alternative
position?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
would
have
to
meet
out
of
the
statutes
some
words
that
are
now
in
it,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
point
is
--
the
point
is
that
the
under
the
common
law,
wherever
the
negligent
act
or
omission
occurred,
wherever
that
occurred,
you
apply
the
law
of
the
jurisdiction
where
the
injury
or
death
occurred
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
in
those
cases,
the
--
the
jurisdiction
is
the
same
place.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
difference
only
arises
where
the
negligent
act
occurs
in
one
jurisdiction
and
the
resulting
injury
or
death
in
another
jurisdiction.
