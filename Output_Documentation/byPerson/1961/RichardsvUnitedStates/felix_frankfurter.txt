justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
narrow
but
it's
pertinent,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
it
helps
analyzing
or
understanding
the
problem
when
we
talk
about
extraterritorial
effects?
do
you
think
that
really
helps
to
elucidate
the
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that
is
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
it's
used
in
these
cases
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
it
confuses
me
instead
of
helping
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
extraterritorial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
where
do
you
get
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
because
--
because
congress
didn't
write
out
and
say,
it
would
be
liable
to
say
in
accordance
of
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
acts
or
omission
occurred,
but
not
to
the
extent
that
the
laws
of
the
place
deals
with
conflicts
of
the
law
problems.
you
say
this
is
an
implied
limitation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
our
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wasn't
the
--
wasn't
the
central
--
the
central
rationale,
the
long
driving
force
behind
that
was
originally
became
to
federal
tort
act,
that
it's
fundamentally
immoral
with
the
united
states
as
an
employer
not
to
be
subject
to
the
kind
of
responsibility
for
which
a
comparable
employer
in
the
same
state
is
liable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
heart
of
that
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
uncle
sam
was
less
liable
than
the
ordinary
employer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
exemption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
regard
the
department
of
justice
as
infallible?
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
other
lawyers,
they
try
to
win
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
long
as
conscience
doesn't
stand
in
the
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rucker,
one
of
the
great
english
judges
of
the
19th
century,
who
introduces
measures
for
the
government,
of
course,
in
the
house
of
lords,
they
said
the
man
who
grabs
the
measure
is
about
the
worst
person
to
tell
you
subsequently
what
he
intended.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rucker,
may
i
put
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
i
put
the
other
converse
case.
suppose
the
negligent
act
or
wrongful
act
or
omission
had
taken
place
in
missouri
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
death
had
occurred
in
oklahoma
and
missouri
law
was
such
a
situation
but
oklahoma
law
is
with
reference
to
ordinary
litigants
(inaudible)
to
place
of
death
and
oklahoma
law
is
much
more
favorable
than
missouri
law,
i
take
it
you
would
feel
bound
not
to
take
that
client's
case
and
say
that
oklahoma
law
governs
because
it's
--
oklahoma
rule
govern
because
it's
part
of
missouri
law.
i
take
it
in
view
of
what
you
say
here
that
lawyers
are
bound
by
whatever
view
they've
taken
in
the
courts
in
all
subsequent
conduct,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
leave
no
doubt
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
negligent
act
or
omission
is
in
missouri
and
the
death
in
oklahoma.
missouri
law
is
that
where
death
occurs
for
wrongful
act
in
missouri,
you
look
for
the
--
for
the
determination
of
legal
rights,
the
state
of
the
law
--
state
of
the
place
of
death
which
was
oklahoma
and
(inaudible)
case
and
i
ask
further
that
oklahoma
law
is
much
more
favorable
in
the
damage
to
the
basis
of
recovery.
do
you
feel
you
couldn't
fairly
represent
a
client?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you'd
be
enforcing
missouri
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government.
i'm
assuming
the
same
situation
somebody
in
the
guiding
tower
or
whatever
you
call
it,
was
negligent
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
supposing
everything
the
same
except
the
states
relationship
reversed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
reading
of
the
act
has
to
be
construed
namely
whether
you'd
merely
take
missouri
law
in
both
negligence
and
death
occurred
in
missouri
or
missouri
law
if
negligence
began
in
missouri
but
the
consequences
resulting
death
in
oklahoma
and
missouri
says
the
reverse
of
what
oklahoma
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
you
would
--
so
you
would
tell
your
client
that
you
restricted
to
the
penurious
basis
of
recovery
of
missouri
although
missouri
says,
“since
your
client
has
died
in
oklahoma,
you
have
the
benefit
of
a
more
favorable,
a
more
generous
oklahoma
law.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
no
lawyers
did
that
except
for
partisan
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
medalie
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
throughout
the
years
that
this
legislation
was
being
urged
on
congress
except
for
committees
that
the
board
just
fighting,
et
cetera
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
was
there
ever
a
thought
of
having
an
independent
tort
law
in
which
the
government
would
be
responsible
over
the
idea
throughout
that
the
government
has
been
employer
on
the
same
basis
of
the
local
employer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
very
early.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
any
event
--
in
any
event,
if
you
have
--
if
the
locale
of
the
negligent
act
is
in
a
different
state,
then
you
have
no
problem
with
confusion
for
this
harmony
so
far
as
the
federal
statute
is
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
federal
statute
makes
the
equation
between
the
government
and
a
private
employer
in
the
same
territory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
similar,
that's
a
loose
term
for
me
in
reading
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
one
thing
you
could
say
is
that
congress
didn't
want
the
united
states
to
be
liable
when
the
private
owner
isn't
or
vice
versa,
the
united
states
to
go
free
when
the
private
owner
has
to
pay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
it
as
one
thing
clear
about
the
whole
pressure
and
momentum
in
history
of
this
legislation,
that's
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
the
language
of
the
--
of
the
statute
doesn't
leave
us
free
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
exercise
our
preference,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
medalie.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
there
is
no
problem
of
statutory
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
did
mean
to
suggest
that
we're
confined
within
what
congress
has
told
us
and
not
our
own
philosophic
preferences
and
they're
particularly
confined
by
the
underlying
basis
of
this
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
can
--
i
say
again
that
i
should
imagine
congress
would
be
startled
to
be
told
that
in
the
same
court,
in
the
district
court,
one
sitting
with
the
jury
and
one
sitting
not
with
the
jury,
a
different
law
applies
under
the
federal
tort
act
as
against
the
relevant
federal
--
state
law
to
be
enforced
depending
on
what
the
government
or
a
private
person.
i
think
one
can
be
awfully
dogmatic
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
the
statute
doesn't
deal
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
causes
the
doubt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
to
the
torts
with
which
it
does
deal,
the
thing
you
can
be
completely
dogmatic
about
is
that
congress
didn't
mean
to
impose
a
liability
from
which
the
private
employer
is
free
or
withdraw
liability
to
which
the
private
employer
is
subjected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
made
no
rule
for
flexibility.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
if
your
--
if
the
petitioner
is
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
petitioner
is
right,
i
should
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
oklahoma
release
to
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can
--
he
can
appeal
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
we
got
more
problems
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
going
for
finding
out
what
the
release
law
of
every
state
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
do
you
say
strict
construction?
this
court
had
to
face
this
problem
in
klaxon
and
we
decided
under
the
year
erie-tompkins
rule,
we
have
to
decide
there
what
is
the
law
of
the
state
and
the
law
of
the
state
is
the
body
of
the
law
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
--
that
all
the
scholars
think
and
agreed
to
the
wisdom
of
that
decision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
it
is
and
we've
acted
on
it.
it
settled
law
i
assume
so
far
as
anything
is
settled
and
applied
again
and
again
the
rest
of
the
country,
the
states
have
adjusted
themselves
to
it,
federal
courts,
there
wasn't
any
thought.
the
argument
was
made
in
klaxon
that
that's
alright
for
--
the
phrases
weren't
used
as
my
memory
serves
me,
internal
law
as
against
the
law
that
--
that
takes
into
account
of
existence
of
other
states,
that's
what
extraterritoriality
means.
but
they
really
get
to
the
notion
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
state
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
you,
you
are
shearing
off
from
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
which
--
and
that
which
they
absorb
is
there
--
what
maybe
the
pronouncement
of
another
state
to
which
they
wouldn't
have
to
yield
but
in
fact
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
follow
that.
if
oklahoma
--
if
missouri
where
the
--
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred,
where
the
negligence
occurred
had
a
rule
that
you
--
that
it
doesn't
care
about
oklahoma
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
they
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
means
--
are
you
telling
me,
i'm
asking
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
law
of
the
48
--
this
is
governed
by
a
lot
of
statutory
enactments
in
relation
to
this,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
problems
are
tied
up
which
you
bundle
up
on
the
conflicts.
i
don't
mean
the
general
conflict
law
that
the
--
that
the
basis
of
liabilities
where
the
--
the
locality
of
the
occurrence
of
the
complaint
of
negligence,
that's
the
general
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
instructing
me.
that's
the
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
i've
learned
something.
i
suppose
that
the
general
law
was
that
--
that
the
cause
of
action
arises
where
the
injury
--
where
the
--
where
the
negligence
takes
place
and
then
variations
on
that
because
of
the
significance
of
death.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you've
looked
into
this
thing
much
more
recently
than
i
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
you're
telling
that
there's
no
legislation
on
this
subject,
you're
also
telling
me
something
i
didn't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
could
tell
me
a
lot
of
things
i
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
patterson,
i
agree
with
you
entirely
that
congress
never
concerned
itself
with
this
problem.
and
the
reason
that
i
agree
with
you,
with
some
familiarity
with
the
legislative
history
of
this
business,
is
that
they
didn't
have
to
bother
about
it
because
they
wanted
to
put
the
government
of
the
united
states
with
reference
to
those
categories
of
torts
for
which
the
government
was
to
held
liable
on
the
same
footing
as
a
private
employer.
so,
when
they
said
--
what
they
did
say
about
the
same
manner
and
extent
in
the
law
of
the
place,
they
dealt
with
all
the
problems
that
were
before
them
from
the
theory
--
on
the
basis
of
the
theory
from
which
this
is
the
language
that
concludes
the
present
time
as
my
brother
whittaker
says
germinated,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
they
never
--
all
these
lawyers
thought
all
problems
was
in
their
mind
because
they
didn't
have
to
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
patterson,
enlighten
me
on
this
point.
if
this
suit
was
brought
in
oklahoma,
with
this
injury
under
a
diversity
of
citizenship
case,
go
on
from
there
under
litigation.
what
--
what
would
the
district
court
with
the
jury
before
him,
what
would
be
the
governing
principles
of
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
in
an
oklaho
--
suppose
it
was
brought
there,
leave
out
the
question
of
release
and
settlement
in
missouri,
let's
begin
to
assume
in
the
--
they
assume
they've
got
jurisdiction
over
you
et
cetera,
et
cetera
and
they
satisfy
the
diversity
of
the
requirement.
go
on
from
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
in
--
in
this
case
--
and
in
this
case,
if
you
are
representing
the
government,
you
would
--
you'd
say
the
same
thing
because
you
would
apply
--
and
this
case
wouldn't
make
any
difference
because
the
local
law,
the
law
of
--
if
one
reads
the
way
the
government
reads
the
section,
the
law
of
the
place
would
be
oklahoma
and
oklahoma
would
refer
you
to
missouri
so
you'd
get
the
same
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
you
get
it
through
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
you
didn't.
no.
all
i'm
saying
--
i'll
put
to
you
first
the
diversity
and
you
--
you
stated
what
you
said
and
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
if
the
government
(voice
overlap)
under
the
federal
tort
act
would
reach
the
same
result
because
that's
oklahoma
law
if
you
read
it
the
way
the
government
reads
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
as
to
48
states
should
get
the
same
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
some
--
