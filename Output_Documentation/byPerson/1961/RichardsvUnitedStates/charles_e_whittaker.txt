justice
charles
e.
whittaker
under
the
missouri
law
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
which
is
$15,000.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
there's
no
limit
in
the
oklahoma
law.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
am
i
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
wonder
if
you
don't
have
to
(inaudible)
involved.
suppose
that
there
was
a
joint
liability,
the
american
airlines
and
the
government,
the
government
would
be
liable
only
under
the
circumstances
and
the
same
law
as
the
private
party,
isn't
that
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
not
your
question.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
you're
really
saying
is
conceding
the
honesty
they
had
the
change
of
heart
between
the
time
they
wrote
in
the
union
trust
case
and
in
this
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
you
mean
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
not
the
death
but
the
negligence
had
occurred
in
missouri.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
wouldn't
--
we
would
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
the
negligence
here
had
happened
in
missouri,
the
same
state
as
in
which
the
death
occurred,
there
would
be
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no
doubt
with
that,
the
missouri
act
would
control.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
we
have
this
question
because
the
negligence
occurred
in
oklahoma
and
its
effect
was
brought
about
in
missouri.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
you
sue
in
oklahoma.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
are
required
under
this
act
to
rely
upon
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
you
say
was
oklahoma.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
now
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
oklahoma
says
giving
effect,
i
mean
the
tenth
circuit,
giving
effect
to
this
act,
this
language
of
this
act,
we
apply
the
oklahoma
law,
but
we
apply
all
of
the
oklahoma
law,
not
just
part
of
it
and
the
oklahoma
rule
of
conflicts
requires
us
to
apply
the
limitations
of
the
death
statute
of
missouri,
but
we
apply
it
not
as
missouri
law
but
as
oklahoma
law
under
our
rule
of
conflicts,
isn't
that
what
they
say?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
rucker.
may
i
ask
you,
please?
isn't
--
is
it
true
that
if
the
government
is
liable
as
with
tort
for
failing
to
make
american
airlines
comply
with
the
safety
regulations
in
oklahoma,
would
not
american
airlines
also
be
liable
for
that
breach
of
safety
regulations?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright,
now
does
not
this
tort
claims
act
require
the
same
judgment
against
the
government
as
it
would
against
the
private
party?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
now
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
i
may
go
just
one
step
further.
they
are
sued
jointly
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
in
oklahoma
for
this
very
thing,
this
death
in
missouri
for
negligence
occurring
in
oklahoma.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
law
then
would
oklahoma
apply
to
american
airlines?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
we're
talking
about
what
law
applies?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
you'd
have
a
different
result,
would
you,
as
to
one
over
the
other?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
if
they
were,
mr.
medalie.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
are
the
--
what
if
they
were
not.
what
are
the
presumptions
here?
did
they
not
use
a
phrase
that
is
broad
enough
to
comprehend
and
embrace
the
rule
of
conflicts
when
they
said
--
well,
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
takes
place,
does
that
mean
some
or
all
the
law
of
that
place?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
would
mean
in
your
view
that
--
in
answer
to
the
question
that
i
asked
mr.
rucker
that
if
american
airlines
and
the
government
were
sued
jointly,
the
same
result,
the
same
judgment
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
only
trouble
with
that
is
it
would
require
us
to
rewrite
the
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
please.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
said
that
each
of
these
parties
settled
with
american
airlines
in
full
and
received
$15,000.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
that
extinguish
the
whole
cause
of
action?
is
this
a
moot
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
it
expressly
reserve
the
cause
of
action
against
the
government
in
the
release
assigned?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
