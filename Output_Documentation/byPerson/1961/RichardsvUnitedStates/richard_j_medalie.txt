mr.
richard
j.
medalie
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
the
present
case
is
a
constantly
recurring
issue
which
in
any
case
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
in
which
the
act
or
omission
takes
place
in
one
state
and
the
injury
leading
to
death
in
another.
(inaudible)
at
the
present
time,
there
are
close
to
100
cases
now
pending
out
of
recent
air
crashes
in
which
this
issue
has
been
presented.
it's
for
this
reason
that
the
government's
interest
today
is
more
than
a
pecuniary
one.
we
are
interested
in
arriving
at
a
satisfactory
solution
and
propounding
a
reasonable
and
workable
rule
by
which
our
liability
may
be
determined
under
that
act
in
cases
of
multistate
tort.
now,
as
the
petitioners
have
stated
--
the
government
and
petitioners
are
in
agreement
that
section
1346
(b)
states
in
clear
and
unequivocal
terms
that
the
liability
of
the
united
states
shall
be
determined
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
we
defer,
however,
as
to
what
the
content
of
that
law
shall
be
unless
the
government
says
that
we
should
refer
to
the
whole
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred
including
the
conflict
of
laws
principles.
in
this
case,
it
would
be
the
court
law
of
oklahoma.
petitioners
on
the
other
hand
would
have
this
court
interpret
1346
(b)
as
referring
to
the
internal
law
of
oklahoma.
and
american
airlines,
our
fellow
respondents,
although
agreeing
with
the
government
make
--
makes
an
alternative
argument
that
1346
(b)
should
be
interpreted
to
refer
to
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
injury.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
each
one
of
these
positions
in
turn.
the
government
believes
that
its
interpretation
of
1346
(b)
as
referring
to
the
whole
law,
not
only
complies
with
the
spontaneous
and
literal
meaning
of
the
language
employed
in
that
act,
but
it
also
complies
with
the
purposes
of
the
act
as
embodied
in
section
2674
which
states
that
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
under
like
circumstances.
thus,
since
a
private
individual
being
sued
in
a
district
court
pursuant
to
diversity
jurisdiction,
since
his
liability
would
be
determined
according
the
whole
law
of
the
state
in
which
that
court
is
sitting
including
the
conflict
of
laws
principles,
according
to
the
rule
laid
down
by
this
court
in
klaxon
v.
stentor
so
too
the
government
would
have
the
tort
claims
act,
sections
1346
(b)
and
2674
requiring
the
court
to
look
to
the
whole
law
of
that
place
where
the
act
occurred
including
the
conflicts
of
laws
principles
when
the
liability
of
the
government
is
to
be
determined
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
it
is
our
contention
that
these
sections,
section
2674
and
1346
(b)
far
from
being
exceptions
to
one
another,
not
as
far
for
having
1346
(b)
as
an
exception
to
2674,
it
is
our
contention
that
these
two
sections
should
be
read
together
in
pair
material
that
they
should
be
given
equal
effect.
in
fact,
just
on
an
ordinary
statutory
interpretation,
ordinary
rule
of
construction
when
two
sections
of
a
statute
refer
to
the
same
subject
matter,
they
should
be
given
equal
effect
unless
they
are
completely
contradictory.
and
indeed,
the
government's
position
shows
quite
clearly
that
these
two
can
be
read
together
so
that
one
may
evolve
a
reasonable
rule
to
govern
the
liability
of
the
united
states.
further,
when
this
--
when
the
1946
act
was
passed,
these
two
sections,
these
two
provisions,
now
embodied
in
1346
(b)
and
2674
were
included
within
the
same
section
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
which
was
then
title
iv
of
the
legislative
reorganization
act
of
1946.
and
each
was
preceded
by
the
proviso
that
it
was
to
be
subject
to
provisions
of
this
act.
in
fact,
the
two
provisions
had
been
included
in
the
same
section
with
the
same
proviso
in
many
of
the
bills
which
preceded
the
passage
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
in
fact,
even
when
these
two
provisions
were
put
into
separate
sections
after
the
revision
of
the
judicial
code
in
40
(a),
nevertheless,
they
were
still
preceded
by
language
saying
that
they
were
to
be
subject
to
provisions
of
this
act.
and
therefore,
for
this
reason,
we
believe
that
two
should
be
read
together
in
harmony
so
that
the
liability
of
the
united
states
would
be
determined
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
occurred
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
under
like
circumstances.
in
contrast,
petitioner
would
have
this
court
interpret
1346
(b)
as
referring
to
the
internal
law
of
the
state
where
the
act
occurred.
the
fact,
under
our
interpretation,
of
course,
it
would
violate
the
clear
requirements
of
2674.
indeed,
petitioners
themselves
at
page
25
of
their
brief,
admit
that
under
their
interpretation,
the
liability
of
the
united
states
would
not
be
the
same
as
a
private
individual
in
like
circumstances.
it
would
not
be
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent.
and
in
fact,
in
the
court
below,
chief
judge
murrah,
when
he
stated
that
the
--
he
would
have
had
the
united
states
be
held
liable
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
under
the
law
of
oklahoma.
he
stated
at
page
45
of
the
record
that
the
government
would
be
held
liable
even
though
a
private
person
would
not
be
liable
according
to
oklahoma
law
under
the
same
circumstances.
petitioners,
however,
say
that
when
this
act
was
passed
in
1946,
we
must
assume
that
congress
was
cognizant
of
the
normal
conflicts
of
laws
rules
which
referred
to
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
injury
as
well
as
being
cognizant
of
the
minority
rule
which
--
which
referred
to
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
act.
and
that
when
it
embodied
in
section
1346
(b),
this
clear
and
unambiguous
language
law
of
the
place
of
the
act
or
omission,
it
in
effect
selected
the
minority
rule,
the
minority
conflicts
rule.
well
of
course,
the
problem
with
this
interpretation
is,
first
of
all,
that
the
section
does
not
say
in
accordance
with
the
internal
law.
it
only
says
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place.
moreover,
there
is
no
indication
in
the
entire
28
years
of
legislative
history
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
that
congress
even
gave
a
second
thought
to
the
problems
of
conflict
of
laws.
it
may
well
be
that
they
were
cognizant
of
conflict
of
laws
rules,
but
with
respect
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
they
never
consider
--
they
concerned
themselves.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
government
interprets
it
to
mean
the
whole
law.
it
--
it's
quite
true
that
it
might
--
it
may
very
well
encompass
a
particular
choice
of
conflict
of
laws
just
as
it
might
encompass
an
embracing
of
the
whole
law
and
then
looking
to
the
states
for
its
own
conflicts
of
law,
but
we
must
interpret,
that
would
seem,
this
section
not
in
vacuum
but
in
context
of
the
whole
act.
i
think,
for
example,
that
petitioners
might
have
had
a
better
case
had
section
1346
(b)
been
the
only
provision
in
this
federal
tort
claims
act
dealing
with
liability
of
the
unites
states.
when,
however,
we
concern
--
we
look
to
section
2674
which
says
that
the
united
states
must
be
liable
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
under
like
circumstances,
i
can
only
draw
the
conclusion
that
congress
then
meant
what
it
said
and
that
when
one
analyzes
how
a
private
individual
is
held
liable
whenever
he's
brought
into
court
and
when
one
realizes
that
a
court
in
effect
looks
to
the
whole
law
and
to
determine
where
the
ultimate
substantive
law
reference
will
be,
i
can
only
conclude
that
congress
also
intended
that
the
liability
of
the
united
states
should
be
determined
in
the
same
manner
and
to
that
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
and
this
is
our
essential
position
here.
indeed,
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
is
that
--
is
this
--
the
use
of
the
language.
in
fact,
this
court
in
the
dalehite
case
which
we
cite
at
page
16
of
our
brief,
pointed
out
that
uppermost
in
the
collective
mind
of
congress
was
the
ordinary
common
law
tort
and
that
the
--
and
that
the
example
which
was
constantly
reiterated
was
that
of
negligence
from
the
driving
of
a
motor
vehicle.
and
when
one
considers
what
happens
when
a
motor
vehicle
has
a
collision,
one
realizes
that
the
act
--
the
accident,
the
injury,
the
death
all
occur
in
a
single
jurisdiction.
therefore,
there
is
no
conflict
of
laws
provision.
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
believe
that
congress
did
not
really
intend
or
rather
it
didn't
even
consider
that
1346
(b)
would,
in
effect,
be
an
indication
of
a
choice
of
conflicts
of
law.
the
--
what
congress
was
interested
in
and
it
is,
i
think,
clear
from
what
it
did
in
the
76th
congress,
which
we
discuss
at
page
14
of
our
brief,
congress
was
interested
in
establishing
principles
of
tort
liability
which
would
not
be
based
on
a
uniform
federal
system
of
tort
liability,
but
rather
that
it
would
have
courts
look
to
the
laws
of
the
state,
look
to
the
local
law,
look
to
the
state
law
in
order
to
determine
liability
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
in
the
original
--
some
of
the
early
tort
claims
bills,
there
were
--
there
was
a
thought
that
a
system
of
compensation
for
personal
injury
and
death
would
be
set
up
and
administered
by
an
employees'
compensation
commission.
this
would
have
been
a
uniform
system
of
liability.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
the
very
early,
yes.
in
the
76th
congress,
first
session,
for
the
first
time
in
senate
2619,
h.r.
7236,
which
we
discuss
at
page
14,
congress
decided
that
the
--
that
the
government
could
be
brought
before
the
district
courts
or
the
court
of
claims
in
order
to
have
its
liability
determined.
once
it
did
that,
it
began
to
change
its
approach.
it
then
began
to
look
to
what
local
law
was.
for
example,
in
--
in
those
first
bills,
they
still
had
certain
elements
of
the
negligence,
specifically
provided
for
in
the
particular
section,
but
later
on,
namely
in
the
77th
congress,
first
session
and
certainly
in
the
second
section,
congress
established
a
means
by
which
the
district
courts
will
have
exclusive
jurisdiction.
and
it
said
and
we
quote
--
and
i
quote
from
page
16
of
our
brief
that
in
vesting
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
district
courts,
congress
did
it
because
the
district
courts
sits
in
only
one
state
and
is
familiar
with
the
local
laws
and
decisions
that
are
made
pertinent
to
the
determination
of
tort
claims
against
the
united
states.
from
this,
again,
i
can
only
draw
the
conclusion
that
congress'
interest
was
to
look
to
local
and
state
law.
and
when
one
looks
to
local
and
state
law,
one
has
to
take
into
effect
or
take
into
consideration
the
problem
--
the
actual
conflict
of
law
provisions.
therefore,
when
a
multistate
court
occurs
as
it
did
in
this
case,
little
comfort
can
really
be
gotten
from
the
--
any
hypothesis
or
speculation
as
to
what
congress
must
have
thought
or
what
congress
must
have
considered
when
it
passed
the
tort
claims
act.
the
only
thing
one
can
do
is
ask
what
congress
actually
did
in
the
situation.
it's
clear
that
congress
did
not
consider
conflicts
of
law
but
how
does
the
act
operate
when
we
have
a
--
an
accident
which
involves
a
multistate
tort?
well,
in
the
first
place,
as
we
mentioned
before,
you
look
to
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
act
and
you
look
into
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
under
like
circumstances.
and
when
those
two
provisions
are
read
together,
the
only
conclusion
can
be
that
the
whole
law
of
the
state
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred
is
the
only
law
which
can
govern
the
liability
of
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
precisely
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
much
has
been
discussed
about
the
union
trust
case
and
it
might
be
interesting
to
see
just
what
did
happen
in
union
trust
because
the
government
has
never
really
recovered
from
the
confusion
which
union
trust
let
us.
virginia
--
the
eastern
air
lines
was
held
liable
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
which
there
was
no
maximum
liability
--
limitation.
united
states,
on
the
other
hand,
was
held
liable
according
to
the
internal
law
of
virginia
which
there
was
this
maximum
limitation
of
$15,000.
moreover,
and
rather
interestingly,
the
district
of
columbia
law
only
satisfied
and
only
gave
recovery
for
pecuniary
loss
to
the
--
to
the
particular
beneficiaries
of
the
decedents
whereas
the
virginia
law
gave
recovery
for
loss
of
deceased
cares
as
well
as
pecuniary
loss.
loss
of
his
attention
in
society
as
well
as
some
which
may
be
deemed,
fair
and
just
as
solatium
to
the
beneficiaries
for
the
sorrow
and
mental
anguish
caused
by
the
death
so
that
when
it
finally
came
time
for
the
united
states
and
eastern
air
lines
to
sit
down
and
workout
a
compromise
as
to
how
would
we
split
the
costs
of
our
liability,
we
found
that
in
certain
instances,
eastern
air
lines,
even
though
being
held
liable
under
the
district
of
columbia
law
would
actually
not
have
to
pay
a
cent
because
the
beneficiaries
were
not
--
did
not
have
any
pecuniary
loss.
they
were
distantly
removed
from
the
deceased
and
therefore
did
not
have
to
rely
on
the
deceased
for
any
pecuniary
loss
whereas
the
government
would
have
had
to
pay
up
to
the
$15,000
limit
of
virginia
since
virginia's
law
covered
so
many
other
factors.
it
is
i
think
at
this
point
that
the
government
began
to
reassess
its
basic
position,
not
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
government
may
win
more
or
lose
more
in
a
particular
case,
but
rather
what
can
be
the
most
flexible
and
reasonable
and
workable
rule
in
the
situation.
and
then
sitting
down
and
going
over
the
legislative
history
again,
and
tying
to
make
sense
out
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
we
arrived
at
a
conclusion
that
it
really
should
be
according
to
the
whole
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred
in
order
to
at
least
have
a
standardized
rule
so
that
time
and
time
again
when
these
situations
occur
in
which
there
would
be
--
there
was
multistate
torts,
we
wouldn't
get
into
these
very
difficult
questions
of
how
we
measure
liability
according
to
different
acts
--
according
to
different
states.
in
fact,
one
other
problem
may
be
mentioned
here,
at
the
present
time
there
are
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
well,
we
would
(voice
overlap)
no.
there
would
have
been
a
problem
under
our
present
rule
because
when
the
eastern
air
lines
and
the
united
states
were
sued
as
joint
tortfeasors.
they
would
--
their
liability
would
have
been
determined
according
to
--
well,
eastern
air
lines
liability
would
be
determined
according
to
the
whole
law
of
state
where
the
court
was
sitting
and
the
government
would
have
determined
according
to
the
whole
law
of
the
place
of
the
act
which
in
turn
would
have
in
most
instances
refer
to
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
injury
so
that
the
measure
of
liability
would
have
been
the
law
of
the
place
of
injury
and
we
would
have
had
a
feasible
solution
to
the
problem.
in
other
words,
each
--
each
defendant
in
that
case,
united
states
and
eastern
air
lines
would
have
had
the
same
type
of
liability.
take
for
example
this
--
this
particular
problem
and
it
has
risen
for
example
in
the
staten
island
crash
that
occurred
some
time
ago.
there
are
now
24
suits
pending
in
that
case.
two
suits
have
been
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia,
16
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
six
in
the
southern
district
and
one
in
southern
district
of
california.
the
negligent
--
the
crash
occurred
in
new
york,
the
accident
occurred
in
new
york.
negligence
in
the
suits
in
district
columbia
are
alleged
in
both
new
york
and
in
the
district
of
columbia.
negligence
in
the
new
york
cases
are
alleged
not
only
in
new
york,
but
also
in
new
jersey
where
there
were
a
radio
contact
with
the
plane
as
well
as
every
single
state
in
which
the
plane
had
passed
over
and
had
ground
to
radio
communication
before
the
crash
occurred,
so
that
we
have
at
least
a
half
a
dozen
if
not
more
states
in
which
there's
an
allegation
that
negligence
occurred
in
these
states.
now,
supposing
it
is
determined
that
indeed
the
negligence
did
occur
in
each
of
these
states,
how
do
we
arrive
at
the
rule?
shall
we
choose
new
york's
rule
or
should
--
if
we
use
the
interpretation
of
petitioner,
should
we
use
new
york's
rule
or
should
we
use
new
jersey's
or
perhaps
california‘s
or
iowa's?
but
the
thing
that
is
the
same
in
each
one
of
these
--
in
the
laws
of
each
one
of
these
states
is
that
they
have
a
conflict
of
laws
rule
which
refers
most
of
the
time
to
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
injury
so
that
we
may
take
these
half
a
dozen
states,
not
have
to
decide
where
the
most
negligence
occurred,
but
in
fact,
refer
to
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
injury
and
therefore
have
a
satisfactory
solution.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
precisely
the
point,
that's
right.
that's
why
we
tend
so
much
importance
to
that
phrase,
the
phraseology
in
section
2674.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
certain
elements
(voice
overlap).
well,
for
example,
take
the
case
of
wells
v.
simonds
abrasive
company.
remember
when
the
accident
took
place
in
alabama
and
under
the
alabama
wrongful
death
statute,
you
have
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations,
but
the
--
but
the
actual
forum
was
pennsylvania
federal
district
court.
when
pennsylvania
referred
to
the
whole
law
of
oklahoma
--
whole
law
of
pennsylvania
to
determine
what
liability
should
be,
discovered
that
pennsylvania
would
have
applied
its
own
statute
of
limitations
which
was
only
one
year
and
therefore
it
dismissed
the
case.
and
this
court
stated
that
this
was
perfectly
legitimate
because
it
was
not
a
violation
of
full
faith
and
credit
cost
to
give
effect
to
its
own
statute
under
certain
circumstances.
and
indeed,
you
have
other
problems
such
as
burden
of
proof
may
evolve
on
either
the
plaintiff
or
defendant
depending
on
the
state
with
respect
to
contributory
negligence.
so,
the
government
isn't
saying
that
we
are
establishing
a
perfect
interpretation.
i
think
that
the
very
essence
of
our
federalism
is
that
we
have
such
a
variety
of
solutions
to
the
different
states
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
well
out
of
this
a
single,
all
inclusive
formula.
i
think
dean
griswold
in
his
discussion
in
the
article
renvoi
revisited
said
that
the
states
are
not
like
a
checkerboard
which
a
black
states
and
white
states
each
which
a
perfect
conflict
of
laws
rule.
the
thing
--
what
we're
trying
to
do
and
i
think
the
thing
that
we're
--
we
think
would
be
the
best
interpretation
is
at
least
to
try
and
arrive
at
the
most
practicable
solution
to
this
problem
so
that
in
--
in
the
majority
of
instances,
in
most
cases,
we
could
have
a
satisfactory
solution.
there's
no
question
that
at
the
present
time,
there
isn't
a
satisfactory
solution
especially
with
some
states
going
off
in
different
directions
or
some
courts
saying
that
you
should
look
into
the
internal
law
of
one
state
or
the
other
or
look
into
the
whole
law
one
state
or
the
other.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
i
think
that
--
well,
i
think
this
--
this
raises
two
questions.
one
question
is
whether
we
philosophically
think
that
one
rule
is
better
than
the
other
and
the
other
question
is
whether
congress
when
passing
the
statute
ever
considered
what
was
better
or
what
--
or
in
effect
what
congress
actually
wanted
to
do
in
this
case
and
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
at
least
was
clear
on
one
point
namely
that
the
liability
should
be
similar
when
the
united
states
is
an
employer
and
when
the
private
employer
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
i've
seen
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
what
i
was
doing
was
addressing
myself
to
the
problem
raised
by
mr.
justice
stewart
that
even
though
congress
wanted
this,
it
may
happen
that
the
laws
of
the
particular
states
are
different
so
that
regardless
of
which
rule
we
accept,
you
will
have
a
disparity
in
recovery.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
in
our
view,
it
doesn't.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
--
that's
quite
true.
that's
quite
true.
for
example,
american
airlines
says
that
in
its
alternative
argument
that
we
--
we
should
refer
to
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
injury
because
this
is
the
normal
conflict
of
laws
rule
and
in
fact,
in
some
instances,
i
suppose
it
would
solve
the
problem
that
you,
mr.
justice
stewart
raise.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
the
only
trouble
is
that
it
doesn't
comply
with
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
and
moreover,
one
other
problem,
in
those
cases
in
which
a
state
would
give
effect
to
its
own
internal
law
when
deciding
and
determining
the
private
liability
of
a
person,
the
inflexible
rule
which
the
american
airlines
proposes
would
put
us
in
a
situation
in
which
the
united
states'
liability
would
be
determined
by
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
injury
so
that
--
then
the
liability
of
the
united
states
would
not
be
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
under
like
circumstances.
i
think
what
the
government
really
is
trying
to
say,
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
our
interpretation
at
least
gives
us
a
more
flexible
rule,
a
rule
which
will
be
governed
solely
by
what
the
local
and
state
law
--
how
the
local
and
state
law
determines
liability
and
that
if
perchance
the
--
there
should
be
changes
in
the
local
and
state
law,
if
perchance
they
switch
from
one
reference
to
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
injury
and
in
certain
instances
may
refer
to
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
act
so
too
the
federal
rule
will
follow
those
changes
and
so
that
the
united
states
liability
will
be
in
most
instances
coextensive
with
the
liability
of
the
private
individual.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i
agree
wholeheartedly.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes,
but
that's
because
there
is
a
specific
exception
in
section
2680.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
the
government
is
in
wholehearted
agreement
with
that
statement.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
so,
the
practical
--
now
turning
from
theory
to
practice
at
this
particular
time,
the
practical
effect
of
the
government's
position
is
that
we
would
refer
to
the
whole
law
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
in
determining
the
liability
of
the
united
states.
now,
oklahoma
does
not
have
a
conflict
of
law
--
conflict
of
laws
principle
which
says
that
the
state
courts
will
look
to
the
internal
law
of
that
state
in
determining
the
liability
of
a
private
individual
in
cases
in
which
the
act
occurs
in
that
state
but
the
injury
occurs
in
the
other.
the
oklahoma
wrongful
death
statute
is
only
operative
when
the
injury
occurs
within
the
borders
of
oklahoma.
the
conflict
of
laws
rule
which
is
operative
in
oklahoma
is
one
which
refers
to
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
injury.
and
that
law
would
be
the
missouri
wrongful
death
statute
and
the
--
and
this
would
govern
the
liability
of
the
united
states,
but
since
that
statute
has
a
$15,000
limitation
and
since
--
since
each
one
of
the
petitioners
has
received
$15,000
from
american
airlines
in
full
settlement
of
its
claim
be
--
under
the
missouri
wrongful
death
statute,
we
conclude
that
the
--
and
we
believe
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
dismissing
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
i
--
it's
a
moot
case
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
under
the
missouri
wrongful
death
statute
or
--
well,
by
way
of
the
whole
law
of
oklahoma.
perhaps
what
you're
driving
at
mr.
justice
whittaker
is
the
problem
of
release
of
one
--
of
all
joint
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i
believe
in
some
instances
they
did
and
some
instances
they
didn't,
but
the
fact
is
that
missouri
goes
--
missouri
law
and
oklahoma
law
are
one
on
this
problem
that
when
you
release
one
tortfeasor,
you
nevertheless
have
a
claim
against
the
other
tortfeasor
so
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes?
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh,
i'm
sorry.
they
have
to
--
i'm
sorry,
they
have
to
include
it
specifically
in
the
release.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
under
oklahoma
law,
they
do
not
have
to
include
it
within
the
release
--
what
they
do
have
to
do
is
if
they
want
to
release
all
tortfeasors,
they
must
include
that
within
the
release,
but
regardless
of
that,
the
question
here
is
not,
what
is
the
effectiveness
of
the
release.
the
question
here
is,
how
the
plaintiffs
may
--
or
the
question
is
may
the
plaintiffs,
may
the
petitioners
recover
under
the
missouri
wrongful
death
statute
to
which
there's
a
reference
by
way
of
oklahoma
law?
and
because
there
is
this
$15,000
limitation,
that
precludes
the
question
because
there
is
no
more
recovery
under
any
other
law
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
not
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
quite
true.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
quite
true.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i
should
think
so.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
we
do
have
more
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
the
--
if
this
court
accepts
petitioner's
interpretation
of
1346
(b)
then,
of
course,
there
is
a
possibility
of
more
recovery
because
at
least
--
and
american
airlines
will
clarify
this,
at
least
in
regard
to
several
of
the
petitioners,
there
was
no
release
of
the
government
in
this
case.
that's
precisely
why
they
brought
the
act
--
they
brought
their
cause
of
action,
their
claims
in
oklahoma
and
a
suit
for
$300,000,
sued
the
united
states
for
$300,000
each.
but
under
the
normal
rule,
if
this
court
were
to
accept
our
rule,
our
interpretation
of
the
act,
that
would
preclude
the
matter
and
there
would
be
no
recovery
in
the
present
case
and
in
those
--
in
that
instance,
the
district
court
was
correct
in
dismissing
the
complaint
and
that,
therefore,
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
