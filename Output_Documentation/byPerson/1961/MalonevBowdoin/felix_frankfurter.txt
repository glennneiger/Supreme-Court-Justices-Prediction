what
does
larson
leave
of
the
(voice
overlap),
won't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
acting
unconstitutionally?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
his
--
by
his
--
by
your
statement,
his
valid
authority,
you
mean
that
--
you
mean
to
cast
to
one
side
the
legal
position
of
the
united
states
and
merely
restrict
his
doings
to
that
which
is
within
the
assumed
scope
of
his
responsibility
without
questioning
the
authority
of
his
superiors,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
when
you
say
his
valid
authority,
if
--
if
the
united
states
is
a
tortfeasor
then
he
is
--
by
tort
also
a
tortfeasor
and
proceedings
could
be
held
against
him,
couldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
joining
the
united
states.
i
don't
mean
its
property
and
therefore
by
valid
authority,
you
mean
nearly
as
a
matter
of
--
the
laws
of
agencies,
was
he
moving
within
inside
the
circle
of
his
own
responsibility
in
relation
to
his
--
his
superior
whatever
the
authority
of
the
superior
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
is
doing
what
he
is
by
virtue
of
his
office
supposed
to
be
doing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
was
--
was
that
the
issue
on
lee
or
the
--
or
title
in
issue
in
lee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
it
was
a
possessory
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
so
far
as
legal
issues
are
concerned,
you
say
lee
was
an
adjudication
of
title
between
the
parties
to
the
litigation
thought
it
might
not
be
binding
on
the
united
states,
same
as
in
this
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
--
i'm
talking
about
lee,
just
to
get
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
read
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
read
larson
but
wasn't
lee
distinguished
on
something
connected
with
the
court
of
claims?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
like
that
was
suggested
of
course
in
lee,
was
it?
was
that
explanation
given
in
lee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nobody
thought
about
that
in
larson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
asking,
i'm
not
stating.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
that
explanation
isn't
--
isn't
one
of
the
rule
because
the
--
the
whole
point
about
sovereign
immunity
is
that
the
sovereign
is
immune
where
another
--
whereas
a
non-sovereign
wouldn't
be
and
so
the
sovereign
can
do
a
lot
of
wrongs,
but
you
can't
go
to
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
though
he
may
merely
be
a
bad
constitutional
lawyer
in
carrying
what
he's
told
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
have
any
reasons,
the
constitution
precludes
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
for
this
--
as
to
states,
you
don't
have
to
have
any
reason.
if
you
can't
sue
a
state
because
the
constitution
forbids,
you
don't
have
to
have
either
a
good
reason
or
a
bad
reason
or
a
midland
reason?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
could
have
been
an
opinion
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
start
with
the
larson
case,
but
before
i
get
to
the
larson
case.
i
want
to
ask
you
this,
forget
the
larson
case
for
a
moment,
suppose
you
had
only
lee
to
deal
with,
what
distinction
would
you
make
in
this
case
--
i
want
to
ask
you
two
or
three
questions
but
i'll
do
it
in
sequence,
suppose
you
had
only
the
lee
case,
what
would
you
do
with
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
you
do
with
lee?
would
you
--
would
you
distinguish
it
or
would
you
say
that
you
ask
to
have
it
reconsidered
and
overruled,
which?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
in
an
unhappy
position
in
taking
an
opinion
by
five
members
of
the
court
as
the
opinion
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
start
from
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
would
you
do
with
lee?
would
you
ask
this
court
to
overrule
it,
if
not,
what
distinction
do
you
offer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
between
this
case
and
lee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
--
first
define
what
they
put
so
fine
that
there
is
a
preliminary
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
your
argument
as
to
sovereign
immunities
makes
no
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
either.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can't
tell
that
until
all
--
until
you
go
through
a
lot
of
reasoning
or
jury
trial
and
so
forth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
--
my
question
to
you
is,
it
does
not
--
is
not
generated
by
any
--
any
interest
in
the
dissent
in
larson.
my
interest
is
a
very
different
thing.
my
interest
is
intellectual
honesty
in
decisions.
what
i
want
to
know
is
shouldn't
we
burry,
if
you're
right,
lee
and
not
keep
it
alive
by
casuistic
and
from
my
point
of
view,
wholly
untenable
distinctions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
leading
of
all
sorts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
shouldn't
it
be
false?
shouldn't
there
be
a
burial
service
of
it?
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
do
you
think
really
a
question
should
be
put
to
the
jury
whether
an
officer
of
the
united
states
is
acting
unconstitutionally?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that's
really
a
jury
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
considering
that
we
split
our
heads
here
into
deciding
that
thing
and
that's
because
you
must
have
a
jury
to
pass
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
which
are
fictions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
before
we
really
understood
what
united
states
against
lee
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
before
we
really
understood
what
united
states
against
lee
really
decided.
that
didn't
come
until
certain
volumes
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
something
like
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mitchell?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
let
me
suggest
that
you
could
use
some
of
superfluous
time
you
have
on
your
hand
by
telling
us
what
you
do
with
the
larson
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
that
in
this
case
if
it
should
turn
out
that
this
land
belonged
to
the
government
but
then
retroactively,
the
suit
should
had
been
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction?
must
you
first
--
in
other
words
in
this
kind
of
a
litigation,
must
you
first
determine
the
merits
before
you
decide
what
the
--
whom
you
can
sue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it's
in
contest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
lee
was
in
contest,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
lee,
there
is
a
controversy
who
owns
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
something
that
lee
family
said
they
had
a
good
chain
of
title,
they
established
a
good
chain
of
title
but
the
government
said
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
title
is
broken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
onto
lee
and
--
and
want
us
to
shut
our
eyes
to
larson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
land
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
also
preceded
larson
and
there
is
good
deal
explaining
of
what
land
--
land
and
larson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
no
rule
if
it's
chloroform?[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
statutory
authority,
mr.
friedman,
except
in
a
very
vague
and
unilluminating
way,
most,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
you
know
more
about
this
certainly
than
i
do,
but
most
government
officials
--
as
to
most
government
officials
within
the
statute
don't
illumine
much
what
their
powers
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
provisions
about
the
congress
appropriate
so
much
money
for
so
many
officials
et
cetera?
and
--
and
i
don't
recall
seeing
many
description
of
duties
of
ordinary
government
officials.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
shall
be
a
commissioner
of
these
and
there
shall
be
commissioner
of
that
and
even
when
they
said
these
duties
shall
be,
they
go
into
the
[inaudible]
so
far
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
be
able
to
tell
from
reading
the
statute,
i
know
a
person
who
did
[inaudible]
the
governor
of
massachusetts
said
he
went
to
the
revised
statute
of
massachusetts,
looked
up
all
the
duties
of
the
government
and
he
knew
what
exactly
what
he
should
do
and
what
he
shouldn't
do,
but
most
people
haven't
got
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
in
the
federal
tort
act
we
have
all
these
problems
that
when
he
does
--
doesn't
do
anything
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
within
the
course
of
duty.
