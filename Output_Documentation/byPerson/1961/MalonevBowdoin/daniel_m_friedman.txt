mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit,
once
again
brings
before
the
court
the
perplexing
problem
of
when
an
action
brought
against
a
government
official
to
restrain
acts
done
in
his
official
capacity
is
in
fact
an
action
against
the
united
states
which
cannot
be
maintained
in
the
absence
of
consent
by
the
united
states.
specifically,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
an
action
may
be
maintained
to
reject
a
federal
officer
from
land
that
he
holds
in
his
official
capacity
and
the
basic
facts
are
simple.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
mr.
malone,
is
a
forest
service
officer
in
the
united
states
forest
service.
in
1959,
the
respondents
instituted
an
action
in
the
state
courts
of
georgia
an
ejectment
to
eject
the
petitioner
from
certain
lands.
the
action
was
brought
in
the
traditional
fictitious
form
which
is
employed
in
georgia
that
is
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
respondents
had
demised
the
land
to
one
john
doe
that
when
john
doe
had
entered
onto
to
the
land
and
then
that
one
richard
roe
had
forcibly
evicted
him
from
it.
and
under
the
settled
practice
in
georgia
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
the
real
party
in
interest,
the
respondent,
is
not
permitted
to
challenge
any
of
these
allegations.
he
asked
to
admit
the
fact
one
of
the
least,
two,
the
fact
of
entry
into
possession
and
three,
the
fact
of
the
ouster
and
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
in
--
under
the
georgia
practice,
this
is
a
method
by
which
basically
the
title
to
land
is
determined.
the
government
and,
i
might
mention
that
the
process
in
the
case
was
served
upon
both
the
petitioner,
mr.
malone
and
upon
the
united
states,
the
government
removed
the
case
from
the
state
court
to
the
federal
court.
and
in
its
petition
for
removal,
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
one
and
two
of
the
record,
the
government
alleged
that
it
had
acquired
the
land
by
a
deed
in
1936
that
since
that
time,
it
had
lawfully
owned
and
possessed
the
same
and
that
the
petitioner,
mr.
malone,
at
all
times
held
the
land
solely
by
virtue
of
his
official
position
and
under
color
of
his
office.
after
the
case
had
been
removed
into
the
district
court,
the
united
states
and
the
petitioner
then
moved
to
dismiss
the
case
on
the
ground
that
the
suit
was
one
directed
against
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
have
not
consented.
and
after
a
pretrial
conference
and
a
hearing,
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss.
the
district
court
pointed
out
that
at
the
pretrial
conference,
the
respondent's
counsel
had
conceded
the
correctness
of
the
allegations
in
the
petition
for
removal
that
at
all
times
the
petitioner,
mr.
malone,
held
the
land
by
virtue
of
the
color
of
his
office
and
as
result
of
his
official
position.
and
the
court
ruled
that
on
the
basis
of
those
facts,
this
case
was
controlled
by
the
court's
decision
of
this
court
in
larson
against
domestic
and
foreign
commerce
corporation
in
337
u.s.
about
which
i
will
have
much
to
say
shortly
and
that
accordingly,
it
was
a
suit
against
the
united
states.
a
divided
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
reversed.
and
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
that
in
the
court's
view,
this
case
was
not
controlled
by
larson
but
was
controlled
by
the
earlier
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
against
lee
in
106.
and
so
we
think
this
case,
as
it
comes
to
this
court,
presents
fairly
the
question
whether
in
this
type
of
a
situation,
this
court's
decision
in
larson
controls
or
whether
the
lee
case
controls
and
i'd
like
briefly
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
it
is
left
virtually
nothing
mr.
justice
at
least
in
its
application
to
this
type
of
case.
i
like
to
refer
briefly
to
the
facts
in
the
larson
case.
in
the
larson
case,
the
war
assets
administrator
had
entered
into
a
contract
to
sell
certain
surplus
coal
of
the
government
to
the
domestic
and
foreign
commerce
corporation.
a
dispute
arose
between
the
administrator
and
the
foreign
commerce
corporation
over
the
terms
of
the
contract
and
the
administrator
ultimately
concluded
that
the
contract
had
been
breached.
he
then
undertook
to
sell
the
coal
to
someone
else.
the
company
instituted
a
suit
in
the
district
court
to
enjoin
the
administrator
from
doing
this
on
the
theory
first,
that
there
had
been
no
breach
of
the
contract
and
secondly,
that
under
the
terms
of
the
contract,
title
had
passed
to
the
company,
and
therefore,
that
what
the
administrator
was
trying
to
do
was
improperly
to
dispose
of
property
which
belonged
to
the
company.
this
court,
after
a
thorough
review
of
the
authorities
in
the
case
in
this
field,
concluded
that
this
was
in
fact
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
and
therefore,
could
not
be
maintained
and
the
court
enunciated
the
basic
principle
that
where
an
action
to
compel
specific
relief
for
--
against
a
government
official,
acting
in
his
official
capacity,
is
brought,
it
is
in
fact
the
suit
against
the
sovereign
unless
one
of
two
conditions
is
met,
either
that
it's
alleged
and
shown,
and
the
court
said
it
had
to
be
specifically
alleged,
that
the
officer
is
acting
beyond
the
scope
of
his
authority
or
secondly,
if
the
officer
is
acting
within
the
purported
scope
of
his
authority
that
such
authority
is
unconstitutional.
in
other
words,
in
those
two
situations,
relief
maybe
had
against
the
officer
and
that
it
is
not
relief
against
the
sovereign
because
the
relief
is
sought
against
conduct
that
is
beyond
the
officer's
authority,
either
the
officer's
actual
authority
or
the
officer's
valid
authority
and
in
that
situation,
the
actions
of
the
officer
are
not
fairly
viewed
as
the
actions
of
the
sovereign.
now,
in
this
case,
we
think
it's
clear
that
neither
of
those
conditions
has
been
satisfied.
there's
no
allegation
here
and
no
claim
that
mr.
malone
in
holding
this
land
in
his
official
capacity
is
acting
beyond
the
scope
of
his
authority.
indeed,
to
the
contrary,
the
respondents
admitted
in
the
district
court
that
mr.
malone
was
acting
solely
by
virtue
of
his
official
position.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
mr.
justice,
the
forest
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
the
forest
service
is
under
the
department
of
agriculture.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
at
the
time
of
this
suit,
this
was
something
called
“a
land
utilization
project”.
as
i
understand
it,
since
this
suit
was
brought,
it
has
become
a
part
of
something
called
the
oconee
national
forest.
there
are
109
acres
involved
in
this
land.
nor
is
there
any
allegation,
and
we
do
not
think
there
could
be
any
showing
that
mr.
malone
in
this
case
is
acting
unconstitutionally.
the
only
possible
theory
upon
which
it
could
be
contended
that
there
is
any
unconstitutional
holding
of
this
land
by
the
petitioner
is
that
the
land
was
being
held
or
taken
without
permitting
the
respondent's
just
compensation.
and
there's
no
claim
made
to
that
effect
and
we
think
that
such
a
claim
could
not
be
made
here
because
if
the
allegation
is
and
this
is
the
claim
that
the
government
is
illegally
holding
this
land,
presumably
the
illegal
taking
of
the
land
occurred
in
1936
when
the
government
acquired
this
property
by
deed.
and
we
believe
that
as
of
--
as
of
the
present
time
at
least
and
some
time
thereafter,
at
least
as
of
1936,
at
that
time
if
there
was
such
a
taking,
the
respondents
had
an
adequate
remedy
by
a
suit
for
just
compensation.
we
also
believe
that
upon
passage
of
the
tort
claims
act,
if
in
fact
mr.
malone
was
improperly
upon
the
respondent's
land,
at
that
point
an
action
for
trespass
might
have
been
maintained.
now,
the
--
neither
of
these
is
the
theory
upon
which
the
respondents
seek
to
maintain
this
action
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
mr.
--
the
respondents
do
not
claim
either
that
the
petitioner
is
acting
beyond
his
authority
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
and
the
statutory
sense
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
or
acting
unconstitutionally.
what
they
are
claiming
is,
basically,
that
he
is
acting
tortuously
that
he
is
holding
land
which
in
good
conscience
belongs
to
them.
they
claim
under
a
claim
of
title
dating
back
to
a
will
of
1857.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
an
ejectment
that's
correct.
it's
as
though
they
claim
in
fact
that
it's
their
land
and
they
want
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
is
wrongfully
in
possession.
now,
we
think
this
specific
suggestion
that
a
suit
of
this
type
may
be
maintained
was
prese
--
was
rejected
in
the
larson
case
and
quite
explicitly.
in
larson,
the
court
stated
that
it
would
not
permit
what
it
called
a
third
category
of
cases
against
which
an
action
might
be
brought
against
a
government
official.
and
the
court
stated
at
page
692
of
its
opinion
as
the
third
category
of
cases
where
the
official,
“wrongfully
takes
or
holds
a
specific
property
to
which
the
plaintiff
has
title”
and
on
that
--
that
theory
that
it
would
be
a
tort.
and
the
court
stated,
i
might
mention
preliminarily
in
the
discussion
of
the
different
types
of
situations
in
the
larson
case
to
which
the
bar
of
sovereign
immunity
is
not
applicable.
the
court
specifically
referred
to
actions
of
ejectment.
the
court
pointed
out
in
its
opinion
that
the
problem
in
this
field
arose
not
in
connection
with
a
suit
for
damages
because
that
--
in
that
case
where
the
officer
is
held
personally
liable
for
damages,
that
will
not
impinge
on
the
sovereign's
property,
but
in
other
types
of
action
where
action
of
the
officer
is
sought
to
be
restrained
or
directed
and
it
mentioned
as
one
of
the
types
of
these
action
--
actions
for
ejectment.
the
court
stated
in
the
larson
case
that
the
mere
allegation
of
the
officer,
acting
officially,
wrongfully
holds
property
to
which
the
plaintiff
has
title,
does
not
meet
the
requirement
in
this
field
that
it
must
also
appear
that
the
action
to
be
restrained
or
directed
is
not
the
action
of
the
sovereign.
the
point
continued
that
since
--
if
the
officer
is
exercising
such
powers
that
is,
the
powers
delegated
to
him
by
the
sovereign,
the
action
is
the
sovereign's
and
a
suit
to
enjoin
it
may
not
be
brought
until
the
sovereign
has
consented.
i
think
the
rationale
of
that
ruling
is
this,
that
as
long
as
the
officer
is
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
valid
authority,
he
is
in
fact
acting
for
the
sovereign
and
if
he
is
acting
for
the
sovereign,
his
action
may
not
be
interfered
with
unless
the
sovereign
has
consented.
and
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
not
--
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
clear
to
your
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
i
used
it
as
a
shorthand
phrase
or
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
we
think
that
in
the
lee
case
--
that
the
lee
case
was
limited
by
this
court
in
the
larson
case.
now,
i'd
like
to
come
to
that.
the
--
this
court
in
the
larson
case,
considered
the
impact
of
the
lee
case
and
this
court
in
its
decision
in
the
larson
case
specifically
distinguished
the
lee
case
on
the
ground
that
the
lee
case
was
one
of
those
instances
in
which
the
suit
might
be
maintained
because
the
government
officers
did
not
have
--
are
not
acting
within
a
constitutional
authority.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
that
--
that
was
--
i
think
that
was
one
of
the
grounds
that
the
united
states
would
not
be
bound,
but
in
this
case,
to
permit
this
action
to
go
forward
would
necessarily
have
a
serious
impact
upon
the
government
property.
i
think
it's
--it's
recognized
that
the
--
if
this
case
would
have
go
forward
and
if
the
respondents
would
have
prevailed
and
to
get
an
order
of
ejectment
against
the
petitioner,
this
would
not
bind
the
united
states
because
it
was
not
a
party.
but,
and
i
think,
this
is
terribly
significant,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
what
the
respondents
are
seeking
is
not
just
to
eject
the
petitioner
from
this
property.
in
other
words,
their
objection
isn't
that
mr.
malone
is
on
the
property
and
they
wouldn't
be
satisfied
if
mr.
malone
was
ejected
and
another
forest
that
mr.
bowdoin
will
put
on
the
property.
what
they're
really
seeking
to
do
is
to
have
ascertained
the
question
of
who
owns
this
property.
this
is
the
purpose
of
their
suit.
now,
i
like
to
refer
again
to
the
lee
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
a
possessory
action.
basically,
it's
a
possessory
action,
but
where
title
is
claimed
by
the
person
in
possession,
necessarily,
the
only
way
that
the
plaintiff
in
the
suit
can
establish
his
possession
is
to
show
that
his
title
is
superior
to
that
of
the
one
in
possession.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
was
the
--
the
effect
in
lee,
but
we
think
that
the
lee
case
in
light
of
larson
did
no
longer
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
as
between
lee,
the
court
explicitly
stated
in
lee,
that
it
would
be
--
adjudication
would
not
bind
the
united
states.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
was
going
to
add
that
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
larson
case
that
at
the
time
of
the
lee
decision
in
1882,
at
that
time,
there
was
no
remedy
available
to
the
plaintiffs
in
the
lee
case
by
which
they
could
obtain
compensation
for
the
taking
of
this
property
and
that
--
subsequently
there
are
two,
five
years
later
the
tucker
act
was
passed
which
did
authorize
such
a
suit
and
then
the
court
went
on
in
the
larson
case
to
point
out
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
that
explanation
was
not
in
terms
given
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
maybe
mr.
justice,
but
that
at
least
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
lee
did
not
speak
in
those
terms
but
lee
did
speak
--
lee
did
speak
in
terms
quite
explicitly
about
the
government
having
seized
the
property,
the
government
holding
it
and
there
being
no
way
in
which
the
plaintiffs
in
the
lee
case
could
obtain
just
the
compensation.
but
in
the
larson
case,
the
court
pointed
that
out
and
then
the
court
went
on
after
distinguishing
lee
to
further
point
out
that
the
existence
of
a
right
of
action
for
a
compensation
is
significant
on
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity
because
if
in
fact
there
is
some
other
way
by
which
the
party
can
get
adequate
compensation
for
the
alleged
unlawful
holding
or
taking,
the
constitutional
claim,
the
claim
that
there
has
been
an
unjust
taking
without
constitutional
recompense
force,
and
therefore
in
that
situation,
the
case
would
not
come
within
the
standards
which
the
court
had
enunciated
permitting
these
suits.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
if
the
sovereign
--
if
the
wrong
action
of
the
sovereign
through
its
officer
is
an
unconstitutional
action,
it
is
no
longer
considered
the
action
of
the
sovereign
and
when
the
so
--
the
officer
was
acting
unconstitutionally
is
not
in
effect
carrying
out
properly
the
sovereign's
business
and
therefore
it
is
not
in
effect
a
suit
against
the
sovereign.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
because
the
purpose,
the
basic
--
i
think
the
basic
purpose
of
the
theory
of
sovereign
immunity
as
it's
developed
now,
i
think
it's
long
past
the
theory
of
the
old
english
theory
that
the
king
can
do
no
wrong,
that
he
can't
--
the
king
can't
be
sued
and
can't
sue
himself,
the
theory
of
it
basically,
i
think
now,
is
the
recognition
that
permitting
suits
against
the
sovereign
has
a
very
serious
and
adverse
impact
upon
the
operations
of
the
government.
this
is
a
--
this
tradition
of
sovereign
immunity
goes
way
back
and
the
court
has
refused
to
extend
it
except
in
situations
where
congress
itself
has
waived
sovereign
immunity.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
was
--
i
was
going
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
--
that's
correct.
i
was
just
indicating
why
we
think
this
--
the
doctrine
should
not
be
extended
as
we
think
the
respondents
were
attempting
to
do
it
in
this
case
that
why
we
think
the
interpretation
given
in
the
larson
case
is
a
sound
one
because
of
the
basic
policy
that
is
inherent
in
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
we
--
we're
not
suggesting,
mr.
justice,
we
recognize
that
if
in
fact,
there
has
been
an
improper
taking
of
the
property
by
the
government,
the
government
in
an
appropriate
suit
would
be
liable
for
just
compensation.
i
--
i
want
to
state
in
all
candor
that
we
have
very
grave
doubts
whether
at
this
time
any
such
mere
action
could
then
maintain
by
these
respondents
because
of
the
long
time
that
has
elapsed
but
in
dealing
with
this
problem,
it
seems
to
me,
you
look
to
the
basic
rights
of
people
in
this
situation.
and
i
--
i
would
say
mr.
justice
douglas
that
as
a
practical
matter
today,
as
long
as
we
do
not
have
--
as
long
as
we
do
have
these
rights
to
sue
for
just
compensation
in
case
of
a
taking
most
of
the
rights
to
sue
under
the
tort
claims
act
that
the
lee
case
does
not
permit
the
maintenance
of
an
ejectment
action
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
government
acquired
the
property
by
deed
in
1936
which
is
--
was
23
years
before
this
action
was
brought.
the
claim
of
title
upon
which
the
respondents
rely,
which
i
say
it
goes
way
back
more
than
a
century,
the
last
one
in
the
chain
of
title,
the
predecessors
of
the
present
respondents,
i
believe,
died
in
1928
and
so
that
at
least
presumably
as
of
that
time,
these
people
came
into
whatever
property
interest
they
had.
now,
i
would
like
also
to
refer
briefly
a
little
bit
to
the
character
of
this
action
in
the
ejectment
in
the
georgia
courts
because
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
the
only
issue
involved
in
the
georgia
ejectment
action
is
possession
not
title.
and
therefore,
they
had
suggested
that
the
lee
case
really
was
a
different
animal
because
there,
in
the
lee
case,
there
was
a
question
as
to
title.
now,
the
georgia
courts
have
stated
that
possession
is
the
object
of
an
ejectment
action,
but
it's
in
the
object
of
an
ejectment
action
only
in
the
sense
that
the
plaintiff
was
out
of
possession,
wants
to
get
possession
for
the
property.
and
he
wants
to
get
possession
of
the
property
because
he
claims
he
has
a
better
title
than
the
respondent
who
is
in
possession.
and
in
this
case,
the
only
way
that
the
respondents
could
possibly
get
possession
of
this
property
as
against
the
petitioner,
mr.
malone,
is
to
show
that
the
title
under
which
mr.
malone
holds
it
that
is
his
authority
is
in
fact
not
a
valid
title
and
thus,
the
only
way
that
they
can
prevail
in
this
action,
we
think,
is
by
challenging
the
title
of
the
united
states.
and
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals,
although
it
repeatedly
stated
that
possession
is
the
only
issue
involved
in
a
georgia
ejectment
suit,
nevertheless,
acknowledged
at
page
23
of
its
opinion,
i'm
sorry,
page
25
of
the
opinion,
that
under
the
georgia
proceedings,
the
respondents
will
be
able
to
show
that
the
united
states
did
not
own
any
title
to
the
lands
which
would
defeat
appellants'
claim.
so
necessarily,
in
disposing
of
this
ejectment
action
on
the
merits,
the
lower
courts
would
have
to
reach
the
question
of
the
title
of
the
united
states
to
these
lands.
and
the
title
of
the
united
states
to
these
lands,
it
seems
to
me,
the
question
relating
to
that,
is
necessarily
a
suit
against
the
sovereign
and
since
the
theory
upon
which
the
respondents
are
challenging
this
title
is
inherently
an
attack
upon
the
title,
the
suit
against
the
petitioner,
the
suit
against
the
petitioner
who
admittedly
holds
this
land
under
his
lawful
authority
necessarily
is
a
suit
against
the
united
states.
it's
a
suit
against
the
united
states
because
its
effect,
if
allowed
to
go
to
judgment,
would
be
to
interfere
with
the
property
of
the
sovereign.
it
will
require
a
determination
of
the
title
of
the
sovereign.
it
would,
in
all
of
its
essential
elements
in
effect,
be
seeking
to
eject
the
united
states
from
this
land
and
we
think
that
this
case
is
squarely
controlled
by
the
larson
case
and
that
the
lee
case
in
this
field,
at
least
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
is
no
longer
applicable.
and
we
therefore
believe
that
this
suit
was
a
suit
against
the
united
states
to
which
the
united
states
had
not
consented,
and
therefore,
that
the
district
court
properly
dismissed
this
action.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
--
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
larson
specifically
considered
this
point
whether
an
action
see
--
in
effect
seeking
recover
property
under
a
claim
of
title
might
be
maintained
solely
on
the
theory
that
the
officer
was
tortuously
holding
it
and
flatly
rejected
it.
i
think
that
the
larson
case
specifically
said
that
unless
there
is
a
showing
either
that
the
officer
is
acting
beyond
his
statutory
authority
or
that
the
officer
is
acting
unconstitutionally
that
you
cannot,
in
any
other
situation,
charge
an
officer
holding
property
of
the
government
in
that
situation.
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice.
i
hadn't
intended
to
do
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
--
you
joined
in
the
opinion
of
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
including
----
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon,
including
yourself.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
well,
we
--
we
think,
i
don't
--
i
have
not
intended
to
leave
out
large
portions
of
the
opinion
because
we
think
that
the
--
the
basic
rationale
of
the
larson
case
faced
this
very
problem
admittedly
in
a
different
factual
contest,
but
the
basic
rationale
of
the
larson
opinion,
we
think,
is
that
you
cannot
bring
the
suit
against
a
government
officer
in
his
official
capacity
merely
on
the
claim
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
we
--
we
suggest
that
lee
be
distinguished
on
the
ground
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i'm
not
--
i
suggest
--
i
think
we
would
probably
ask
in
both
steps,
but
first,
i
ask
for
it
to
be
distinguished
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
i
meant
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
correctly.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
distinct
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
distinction
i
offer
between
this
case
and
lee
is
perhaps
two-fold.
first
is
the
distinction
that
in
the
lee
case,
the
court
found
that
there'd
been
an
unconstitutional
taking.
the
property
was
being
held
and
there
was
no
way
in
which
recompense
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
a
jury
question.
and
secondly,
the
fact
that
in
the
lee
case,
factually,
there
are
distinctions
that
in
the
lee
case,
the
government
had
in
effect
seized
the
property
that
it
was
before
that
time
it
was
clearly
in
the
possession
of
the
plaintiff's
ancestors
in
the
lee
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
distinction
is
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
i
suggest
this
as
the
distinction
that
where
the
officer
acts
in
a
way
that
it
is
within
his
authority,
purported
authority
but
in
fact,
that
authority
has
not
been
validly
conferred
in
con
--
in
the
constitutional
stand,
that
is
the
statute
under
which
he
acts
as
unconstitutional
or
the
particular
conduct
which
he
engages
deprives
the
plaintiff
of
his
property
without
due
process
of
law
then
in
that
situation,
the
action
of
the
officer
fairly
viewed
is
not
the
action
of
the
sovereign
because
he
is
going
beyond
his
valid
authority.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
then
--
ma
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
lee
case
has
been
buried
in
larson.
and
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
--
i
hope
that
this
maybe
the
occasion
for
that.
i'd
like
to
answer
one,
if
i
may
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
like
to
answer
one
thing
more
that
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
me
with
respect
to
the
jury
trial
which
is,
there
may
of
course
be
preliminary
questions
before
determining
whether
the
sovereign
immunity
applies
that
is
whether
in
fact
the
officer
is
acting
within
his
authority
or
the
constitutional
questions,
but
those
questions
are
preliminary
questions.
in
the
lee
case,
it
happens
that
these
preliminary
questions
were
determined
in
effect
that
the
--
in
the
lee
case,
the
case
went
to
trial
before
the
jury
and
we
recognized
and
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
are
many
situations
in
which
it
is
necessary
to
make
this
preliminary
inquiry
before
reaching
the
constitutional
(inaudible).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
mr.
--
no,
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
there
are
preliminary
questions
which
may
exist
in
this
field,
but
we
don't
think
any
of
them
exist
here
in
view
of
the
admitted
allegations
before
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
i
--
i
would
prefer
if
i
may
reserve
the
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
i've
completed
my
direct
presentation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
pleas
the
court.
i
just
like
to
say
one
thing
that
land
against
dollar
to
which
i
had
not
previously
referred
is
specifically
discussed
in
the
larson
opinion
and
specifically
distinguished
on
the
ground
that
the
allegations
in
that
complaint
whether
that
the
people
involved
the
members
of
the
maritime
commission
had
acted
in
excess
of
their
statutory
authority
which
is
one
of
the
two
grounds
upon
which
--
under
which
suits
maybe
maintained
under
the
larson
decision.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
is
true
but
--
there
is
in
every
situation
--
i
mean,
well
there
are
certainly
areas
where
it's
clear
and
there
are
many
areas
which
--
on
which
is
in
that
situation.
this
is
a
threshold
question
but
one
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
the
--
there
are
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
that
the
larson
case
together
with
the
land
case
indicate
that
there
are
many
difficult
areas.
and
i
think
it's
for
that
reason
that
in
the
larson
case,
it
was
indicated
that
when
a
claim
is
made
that
a
government
official
does
something
which
he
is
not
authorized
to
do
under
the
statute,
you
have
to
specifically
indicate
the
statutory
limitations
set
forth.
and
there
maybe
--
may
well
be
situations
where
you
will
have
before
passing
on
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
at
threshold
legal
question
whether
in
fact
there's
a
fair
allegation
that
the
officers
acting
beyond
his
authority.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
very
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
most
difficult
ones.
thank
you.
