mr.
william
buford
mitchell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit
says,
this
case
is
identical
with
lee
versus
uni
--
united
states
versus
lee.
the
government's
attorney
has
skipped
over
altogether
land,
chairman
of
the
maritime
commission
versus
dollar,
stanley
dollar,
dollar
steamship
lines
and
those
other
parties
to
that
case
in
which
you
held
that
a
suit
for
the
recovery
of
prop
--
for
possession
of
property
could
be
maintained
against
government
agents.
in
land
versus
dollar,
mr.
land
and
the
other
members
of
the
maritime
commission
got
a
hold
to
the
stock
of
the
dollar
family
and
the
dollar
steamship
lines
and
wouldn't
return
it
back
to
them.
they
contented
that
the
stock
was
only
pledged
to
the
maritime
commission
for
a
loan
and
the
loan
had
been
paid
and
when
the
loan
was
paid,
they
demanded
their
stock
and
the
government
then
came
in
with
the
same
contention
here,
you
are
asking
for
a
judgment
that
will
expend
itself
on
the
united
states
treasury
and
even
if
you
pledged
it
and
have
paid
it,
you
cannot
maintain
this
suit.
now
here,
we
have
a
suit
that
is
a
common
practice
in
georgia
and
the
only
thing
that
--
this
is
what
we
call
the
john
doe-richard
roe
form
of
ejectment
instead
of
bringing
a
ten
or
15-page
suit
in
equity
and
the
easiest
way
you
get
thrown
out
of
court
in
georgia
is
bring
an
equitable
action
for
the
possession
of
land.
i've
tried
it
myself.
in
fact,
the
government
has
cited
one
case
here,
nottingham
versus
elliott,
in
which
i
was
a
writer
of
the
brief
in
the
supreme
court.
they
dismissed
me
on
demurrer
in
the
lower
court
and
affirmed
it
on
the
appellate
court.
you
can't
get
ex
--
equitable
relief
in
georgia
if
you
have
a
plain
legal
remedy
and
a
--
as
our
writers
have
said
in
georgia,
the
ingenuity
of
land
has
never
found
a
method
to
test
the
possession
of
land
that
our
john
doe-richard
roe
form
of
ejectment.
you
come
in
to
court
and
you
put
it
down
squarely
to
a
man.
you
say,
“you
are
on
my
land.
get
off!”
and
it's
just
a
few
lines
on
the
john
doe-richard
roe
form
of
ejectment.
then,
the
man
that
you
say
transcends
possession
says,
“he
can
go
so
far
as
to
say
i…”,
but
of
course
they
generally
say,
“i
am
not
guilty
of
the
acts
complained
of”,
and
that's
all
the
answer
you
need.
the
law
says,
you
admit
that
he
is
in
possession
and
he
has
got
--
that
you
--
you
say
that
the
other
man
in
his
possession
and
the
defendant
has
got
to
come
in
and
say,
“yeah,
i'm
in
possession
and
i've
--
i've
ousted
you.
and
i'm
entitled
to
stay
in
possession”.
under
that
writ
or
under
that
action,
you
only
get
a
writ
of
possession
for
the
land.
then
we
have
what
we
call,
“man's
profits”
that
if
he
has
farmed
it
then
owe
some
rent,
you
will
make
a
further
allegation
as
to
man's
profits.
in
this
case,
if
the
government
had
gone
in
there
and
cut
out
timber,
this
tract
of
timber
as
this
land
is
heavily
timbered.
it
has
started
off
back
during
the
depression
days
as
what
we
call
“a
shutdown
in
georgia”,
rehab
farmers.
i
think
it
was
rehabilitation
resettlement
corporation,
if
i
remember
correctly
the
name,
but
the
government
vowed
up
a
lot
of
land
and
put
farmers
in
that
site
to
help
the
economies
on
in
middle
georgia.
now,
in
19
--
in
1857,
mr.
tolan,
the
ancestors
of
these
people
made
a
will,
the
same
type
of
will
that
mr.
custis
made
to
general
lee's
daughter.
he
left
it
to
her
--
her
lifetime
and
then
as
her
death
to
her
son
--
to
her
children,
george
w
c
--
custis
lee
brought
this
action
against
the
admiral
or
the
general
land
in
georgia.
in
1857,
mr.
tolan
made
a
will
deeding
his
pro
--
willing
his
property
to
his
children
and
he
left
it
to
the
ancestors,
the
mother
of
two
of
lees
and
the
grandchildren
of
other
say
“she
shall
have
it
her
lifetime
and
at
her
death
that
it
should
go
to
her
children”.
now,
this
is
getting
into
facts
and
the
government's
argument
has
been
in
it.
we
can
show
the
facts
to
be
identical
with
the
lee
case.
it
hits
in
all
force
but
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
now,
it
says
it
--
i
wouldn't
--
i
haven't
read
the
record
in
that
case,
but
if
i
believe
if
you
will
check
the
original
record,
you
possibly
will
find
it
was
john
doe-richard
roe
because
in
the
opinion
it
says
in
the
fictitious
form
as
used
by
the
statute
of
virginia
and
our
case
that
is
what
we
call
it
fictitious
but
reading
the
lee
case,
you
will
find
it
says
that
it
was
brought
in
the
fictitious
form
as
provided.
now,
i
haven't
read
the
original
record.
it
was
up
either
in
virginia
or
here
and
i
have
no
facilities
in
middle
georgia
to
look
it
up.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
sir?
well
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
no,
sir.
but
we
say
that
as
--
as
judge
cameron
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
says
a
careful
examination
of
lee
shows
that
it
has
been
cited
300
and
something
times
and
by
the
supreme
court,
58
times
on
the
distinguished
form.
you
cited
it
in
the
case
of
land
versus
dollar
when
you've
held
that
a
type
action
for
the
possession
of
property
could
be
maintained
against
the
officer
in
georgia.
now,
they
talked
about
acting
outside
of
his
authority.
we
say
in
this
case
when
we
bring
this
action
to
dispossess
the
government
agents
in
charge,
he
has
walked
on
our
land
there
whether
he
had
--
it
has
been
done
by
his
superiors
ordering
or
in
the
lee
case,
by
order
of
the
president
and
that
as
the
lee
case
went
more
in
which
the
government
went
in
there
and
just
took
without
any
reasonable
rhyme
as
counsel
--
opposing
counsel
says
in
the
lee
case
the
government
levied
on
it,
put
taxes,
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
taxes
they
could
have
assessed
at
that
time
because
we
have
no
--
have
no
ad
valorem
tax
now
but
possibly
that
did
have
at
that
time,
but
the
government
sold
it
and
the
basis
that
mr.
george
washington
thought
custis
lee
recovered
it
was
that
--
the
general
holding
it
or
the
tax
collectors
holding
it,
refused
to
permit
a
friend
of
mrs.
lee
to
pay
the
taxes
and
held
that
they
had
to
come
up
there
and
personally
pay
it,
of
course
it
was
highly
in
front
of
all
of
it,
mrs.
lee
would
come
up
personally
and
pay
the
taxes
at
that
particular
time.
and
they
went
to
trial
on
--
it
went
to
trial
in
virginia
before
jury
and
that
the
virginia
jury
and
the
courts
held
that
they
acquired
no
title
by
that
illegal
land.
and
the
general
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
as
i
understand,
this
is
not
one
of
the
things
which
the
constitution
gives
the
government
the
right
to
condemn
for.
they
got
by
far
this
land
on
it.
it
is
now
what
we
called
the
piedmont
reserve.
locally,
they
haven't
--
they
signed
there,
showing
the
ducks
flying
by
and
we
have
a
game
preserved
on
their
own
part.
the
government
owns
a
considerable
lake
ridge
in
that
territory
but
i
--
for
park
purposes
but
back,
when
they
acquired
this
land
by
purchase
for
the
rehabilitation
and
settlement
corporation,
i
don't
believe
it
was
in
the
constitutional
authority
to
condemn
it
and
in
getting
down
to
the
facts
on
why
it
is
our
land,
my
clients,
mother
and
grandmother
acquired
a
life
estate
in
it.
she
sold
that
life
estate
to
a
man
named
roberts
in
1873,
roberts
in
1900,
sold
it
to
browns.
browns
--
and
the
she
went
and
sold
109
acres.
well
our
statute
law
in
georgia
says
if
you
haven't
applied
for
estate
even
if
you
make
a
straight
how
to
warrant
a
deed,
you
only
convey
whatever
life
--
the
life
estate
you
had.
no
question
about
that.
and
then
when
roberts
sold
some
500
acres.
i
say
that
the
deed
is
broad
enough
to
include
this.
then
in
1936,
brown
sold
it
to
the
government,
but
our
contention
is
if
it
--
if
we
can
sue
and
the
only
thing
involved
here,
simplify,
i
believe,
and
it
just
appeared
in
court
in
april
of
1959
and
we
have
been
arguing
almost
three
years
on
the
jurisdiction
facts
that
are
involved
here.
we
can
show
that
the
ancestor
of
our
clients
died
in
1928.
now
in
1928,
under
the
georgia
law
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
alright.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
thank
you,
sir.
as
i
was
getting
into
--
the
government
has
gotten
away
from
land
versus
dollar
all
the
way
is
that
would
apply
in
this
case,
you
will
find
on
733
of
u.s.
versus
dollar,
where
the
right
to
possession
or
enjoinment
of
property
under
the
general
law
is
an
issue
and
the
defendants
claim
as
officers
or
agents
of
the
sovereign,
the
rule
of
u.s.
versus
lee,
the
citation
has
been
repeatedly
approved.
then
on
738
they
had
no
--
this
court
held
was
false.
and
where
they
unlawfully
seized
or
hold
a
citizen's
realty
or
chattels
recovered
by
appropriate
action
at
law
or
in
equity,
he
is
not
relegated
to
the
court
of
claims
to
recover
a
money
judgment.
the
dominant
interest
of
the
sovereign
is
then
on
the
side
of
the
victim
who
may
bring
his
possessory
action
to
reclaim
that
which
is
wrongfully
withheld.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
sir?
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
well,
i
thought
it
would
might
be
a
good
law
and
i
thought
that
it
should
have
been
what
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
sir?
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
that
--
you're
referring
to
larson?
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
i
don't
think
it
would
be
any
difference
if
the
janitor
--
if
i
had
a
home
next
to
the
post
office
in
georgia
and
while,
for
instance,
while
i'm
up
here,
the
janitor
went
in
there
and
took
charge
of
it.
and
when
i
got
back
to
georgia,
the
janitor
says,
“well,
you
can't
dispossess
me
from
this.
i'm
a
government
employee
and
i'm
holding
this
for
the
convenience
of
the
government
so
i
can
get
up
early
and
go
around
and
clean
up
the
post
office
the
next
morning”.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
if
a
government
--
if
a
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
i
say
that
law
would
be
analogous
say
for
some
children
inherited
some
land
and
they
were
just
minor
small
children
and
the
government
went
in
there
and
built
a
post
office
on
their
land
and
then
when
they
became
of
age,
i
would
say
that
they
could
dispossesses
the
postmaster
or
somebody.
i
don't
know
where
they
bring
it
against
the
postmaster
or
whoever
is
the
postmaster
in
charge,
i
say
the
same
law
would
--.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
well,
i'm
afraid
we
get
into
what
they
want
us
to
think
about.
as
i
understand,
they
should
have
condemned
that
property
if
they
have
the
right
to
condemn
it,
if
they
take
it
or
--
and
i
don't
much
about
the
court
of
claims
or
these,
but
it
would
make
such
as
a
harsh
rule
for
us
when
they
say
they
came
in
possession
of
it
and
the
government
passes
a
six
year
statute
on
claims
rehear.
there's
no
statute
of
limitations
in
georgia
as
to
the
recovery
of
land.
you
prescribe
against
it
and
we
have
descriptive
that
bores
you
sometimes,
but
we
say
here,
when
this
lady
died,
this
daughter
of
the
testator,
that
--
title
to
that
land
immediately
descended
into
the
--
our
heirs,
title
--
and
we
were
entitled
to
position
and
anybody
came
in
to
possession
and
after
then
came
in
as
trespassers.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
you
don't
have
statute
of
limitations
to
land
in
georgia.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
you
prescribe
against
it.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
yes,
there's
no
statute.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
there
are
two
of
them.
there's
one
on
the
bill
of
title
that
--
the
seven
years
without
cover
--
color
of
title
is
20.
but
there
has
been
no
prescription
in
this
title
you
have
in
this
land.
you
have
to
show
possession
that
is
--
is
so
note
--
well
first
you've
got
to
go
from
the
end
on
the
claim
of
right.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
well,
i
will
be
glad
to
go
with
--
i
haven't
gotten
so
much
more
to
say.
it's
a
very
short
case.
my
brief
is
very
short
and
i
--
i'm
not
generally
long
winded
and
i
may
need
this
extra
time
to
take
compliment
there
to
minutes.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
sir?
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
yes,
sir.
but
--
in
--
to
prescribe
against
land,
you
have
to
show
certain
means
of
possession
like
wiring
in,
if
possession
--
first,
you've
got
to
go
on
the
claim
of
right.
and
then
your
possession
has
to
be
so
notorious
as
to
put
the
world
unnoticed
that
you
are
claiming
it.
this
land
is
out
there
on
the
edge
of
what
we
call
the
piedmont
reserve.
i
think
they
have
it
something
else,
but
on
the
edge
of
that,
it's
just
growing
--
it's
been
growing
timely
since
1928
or
far
behind
that.
and
there's
no
possession
that
could
even
come
under
where
they
could
prescribe
to
get
good
title.
now,
if
we
go
in
to
--
we
don't
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
we
can
allege
in
the
court
of
claims,
we
don't
know.
when
the
government
took
charge
of
it
or
whether
they
are
even
claiming
or
not,
it
--
when
--
because
in
1936
deed,
they
got
original
deed
called
for
1800
and
something
acres
and
then
they
laid
a
team
animal
to
plot
claimants
of
something
in
excess
of
2000
well
if
it
gets
down
there,
we
finally
have
juris
--
if
you
decide
we
have
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
it
may
be
that
superiors
of
the
petitioner
here
will
say,
“we
don't
have
that.
i'm
general
counsel
for
ti
--
i'm
general
counsel
for
tip
colleague
down
and
emphasize
a
little
small
girl's
colleague
and
few
years
ago,
in
the
same
territory,
it
was
determine,
the
colleagues
spoke
and
sold
all
the
land
to
these
people
here
in
the
adjoining
county
of
jones
and
then
when
the
men
start
to
survey
it
and
they
said,
“well,
we
don't
know
that
you
own
300
and
something
acres
here
and
we
saw
[inaudible]
in
$80,000
on
the
300
and
something
acres
of
land
and
there
are
number
of
teacher's
residences
there.
and
it
may
be
that
if
we
can
get
in
to
court
here,
they
will
determine
that
they
don't
own
this
after
they've
taken.
now
another
thing,
the
government
attorney
said,
“count
me
in
two,
they
brought
in
the
end
later
and
after
careful
and
diligent
researching
their
files
has
found
a
lot
here
where
i
will
state
now
our
contention.
that
was
at
the
time
i
sent
the
united
states'
attorney
and
the
attorney
general's
registered
copies
of
this
ejectment
suit
in
jasper
county.
i
think
we've
mentioned
that
the
case
was
original.
it
was
brought
in
the
state
court
of
georgia
and
removed
federal.
i
believe
counsel
mentioned
that.
well,
they
say
that's
where
they
get
--
i
did
it
after
checking
in
to
some
law
about
the
statute
of
limitations,
they
say
that
we
can't
bring
it
because
of
our
last
days
but
it
has
been
the
last
days,
our
land
has
been
there,
we've
been
holding
on
to
a
title
that
is
superior
to
the
government's
title.
and
of
course,
the
only
thing
involved
here
is
--
the
only
thing
the
court
could
give
us
would
be
a
writ
of
possession.
now,
you
can
defend
all
these
cases
by
showing
a
superior
title
or
you
can
recover
possession
just
on
your
prior
possession
alone
against
a
trespasser
or
against
the
word
except
you're
owning
or
you
can
defend
an
action
of
ejectment
by
showing
a
paramount
title
in
a
third
person
not
even
in
possession,
not
even
in
the
involved
in
the
suit
that
this
defendant
can
successfully
interfere
against
the
plaintiff
by
showing
a
paramount
title
in
a
third
party.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
we
are
trying
to
get
rid
--
writ
of
this
possession
against
the
petitioner,
mr.
malone.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
if
we
get
that,
we're
going
to
start
to
cut
some
timber
on
there
and
you
going
to
hear
this
voice
solely
and
they're
going
to
do
like
they
did
in
the
lee
case,
they're
going
to
come
in,
and
you
know
the
lee
case
is
a
[inaudible]
case.
it
was
originally
general
lee
against
of
georgia
department
so
far
as
custlis
lee
against
the
general
--
i
believe
that
general
koffman,
i
maybe
mistaken
about
something
else
but
i
think
it's
general
koffman.
the
attorney
general
just
lay
the
suggestion
down
there
in
the
state
court
and
then
when
he
recovered
it,
that's
where
the
case
got
in
there
u.s.
versus
lee.
we
have
held
this
u.s.
versus
bowdoin,
i
know
you
may
pronounce
it
different
ways
enjoined
we
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
that's
exactly
right,
sir.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
i
understand.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
i
don't
think
so.
i
believe
you
could
like
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
larson
case
was
originally,
if
i'm
correct,
the
larson
case
was
brought
against
another
man
and
then
jeff
larson
succeeded
him,
i
didn't
know
whether
it's
amber
emory
land
or
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
larson
i
believe
i
just
make
a
different
part
in
there
and
--
and
go
that
way
or
--
in
an
ejectment
suit,
it
don't
make
any
difference.
if
all
of
you
gentleman
come
down
and
claim
and
all
we
got
to
do
is
serve
you
with
copy
of
the
process
and
you
will
be
bound
by
it.
that
our
--
that's
we
took
bring.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
well,
we
would
not
to
that.
but
i'll
just
use
--
i
--
i'm
not
trying
to
be
factious
either
but
you
serve
anybody
that
you
find
that
he
is
claiming
and
not
just
your
--
it's
a
matter
of
excellent
way
to
try
the
possession
of
land.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
well,
that
was
done
back
in
1700
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
--
and
i
don't
know
how
to
bring
it
in
other
way
--
we
have
what
we
call
as
jack
jones
form
that
i
don't
know.
sir?
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
jack
jones.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
mr.
jack
jones.
that
way
--
you
don't
have
to
text
your
title
to
john
doe-richard
roe
that
he
bring
of
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
jack
jones,
what
we
call
a
jack
jones,
you
have
to
attach
an
abstract
to
the
title.
but
here,
you
don't
have
to
do
anything.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
sir?
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
well,
that
wouldn't
be
applicable
here
because
that
would
go
away
all
back.
i
had
studied
that
a
little
in
law
school
but
i
never
did
--
i
don't
think
it
has
much
of
[inaudible]
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
well,
as
i
understand
back
before
1776
you
--
the
sovereign
could
do
no
wrong.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
and
you
couldn't
bring
one
sir?
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
there's
never
been
a
case
so
far
as
i'm
able
to
find
in
georgia
where
this
has
been
a
suit
against
any
government
agencies.
i
think
this
case
on
a
--
well
i
first
found
one
in
a
district
court
out
in
california,
oscar
house.
and
i
think
i
have
recited
in
my
brief
against
admiral
so
and
so
and
that
deal
that
and
i
started
to
write
it
down
and
got
in
to
lee
and
then
get
into
land.
i
thought
i
had
two
mighty
good
cases
there
and
in
[inaudible]
in
brief
thought
that
of
like
mr.
friedman
here
that
a
--
those
are
two
landmark
cases
and
if
they
are
still
the
law
of
the
land
that
we
are
entitled
to
bring
this
action
and
it's
going
to
take
a
lot
of
overruling
and
overrule
both
of
them.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
yes,
sir?
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
larson
case
is
an
action
for
personal
property
and
for
damages.
land
is
for
property.
lee
is
for
specific
property
as
both
of
those
cases
hold.
larson
is
one
in
which
the
coal
commission
or
whatever
they
call
it
at
that
time,
sold
the
property
as
the
defendant
in
here
say
as
to
him
and
then
because
he
didn't
comply
with
certain
regulations
by
depositing
money,
they
said
they
wouldn't
go
and
sell
it
to
him
and
then
he
brought
a
mandatory
action
against
larson
for
property
that
belonged
to
the
government.
there
was
never
--
any
question
and
that
the
government
had
good
title
to
that
property
in
land
and
in
dollar
and
lee,
there's
question
about
the
government.
they
--
both
of
those
cases
hold
that
the
government
didn't
have
title
because
lee
--
was
because
of
the
void
tax
sale,
land
because
of
the
stock
of
the
dollar
steamship
lines
was
pledged.
and
in
larson,
it
was
admitted
by
all
concerned
that
the
titles
to
that
coal
belonged
to
the
government
and
that
would
have
been
a
mandatory
and
to
think
would
have
been
a
mandatory
injunction
to
require
mr.
larson
to
convey
that
coal
to
the
defendant
and
to
the
respondent.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
well
that's
if
the
government
owns
the
land
and
all
of
the
--
all
of
these
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
well,
if
--
if
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
--
i
would
say
it
will
be
in
contest
but
it
--
there's
no
way
to
determine
who
has
the
right
of
possession
until
it
is
tried.
if
we
--
if
i
will
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
sir?
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
well
it's
the
same
thing
that
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
that's
right.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
the
government
says
they
got
good
title
about
tax
sale
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
--
and
the
court
said
that
it
was
a
void
tax
sale
and
the
lease
title
would
do
that
here.
we
don't
even
have
the
government.
we
say
the
government
has
no
title
to
it
because
we
own
it
and
they
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
yes.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
no
sir,
i
want
you
to
follow
land,
too.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
land
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
as
i
understand
the
explanation
between
them
is
larson
would
have
been
in
effect
a
mandatory
injunction
requiring
the
commissioner
to
convey
coal
to
the
defendants'
in
there.
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
well
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
sir?
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
no,
sir.
i
think
if
that
--
might
have
to
reconcile
some
of
them
but
i
can
see
no,
personally,
i
can
see
no
conflict
in
deciding
this
case
as
a
--
as
a
fifth
court
--
fifth
circuit
of
court
of
appeals
decided.
and
--
and
as
you
have
said
in
larson,
i
believe
you
said
that
it
hasn't
been
overruled
or
you
distinguished
larson
from
land.
and
--
mr.
william
buford
mitchell
well,
it
might
have
been
as
the
district
judge
or
some
district
judge
up
in
eastern
district
of
north
carolina
or
south
--
north
carolina
i
believe
said
it
was
severely
limited
but
when
in
this
case,
it
wouldn't
be
--
have
to
be
limited
as
it
what
i
have
to
be
almost
all
rules
does
not,
i
believe
when
the
justices
had
said
you
may
--
could
bear
one
without
absolutely
overruling.
but
then,
in
the
appendix
of
the
argument
of
the
government
in
their
brief
they
go
in
to
the
law
of
congress
requiring
the
--
the
attorney
general's
office
to
certify
that
they
have
good
title
before
they
can
buy
land
for
over
$25,000
but
if
they
overlooked
something,
i
know
now
that
in
monroe
county
they
are
trying
to
acquire
some
property
and
they
have
lawyers
co
check
the
titles.
they're
using
some
of
the
layman
employees
over
there
in
this
reserve.
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
give
a
good
opinion,
he
might
write
some
maps
and
send
it
up
here
and
the
attorney
general's
office
approve
it
but
that
wouldn't
show
that
he
got
perfect
title
to
it
and
i
submit
that
if
lee
and
dollar
have
anything,
anything
today
then
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
