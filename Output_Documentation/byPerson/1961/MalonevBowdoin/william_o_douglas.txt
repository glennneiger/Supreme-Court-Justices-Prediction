justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
held
in
the
lee
case
to
be
a
jury
question.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
the
other
reason
was
the
reason
given
by
the
department
of
justice
below
and
the
district
court,
i
think,
that
united
states
wouldn't
be
bound
in
any
event.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
that
would
be
true
--
what
the
larson
case
says
about
lee
would
be
true
of
any
ejectment
action,
wouldn't
it,
because
if
the
government
is
right,
the
--
the
government
has
the
property
without
paying
compensation
if
the
claimant
--
private
claimant
is
right
and
the
government
--
if
it
wants
possession,
must
pay
just
compensation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you're
assuming
large
sections
of
the
--
chief
justice
vinson's
opinion
in
larson
in
which
five
members
of
the
court
--
in
which
five
members
of
the
court
joined.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
think
there
were
only
four
that
joined
they
make
--
made
it
five.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
there
were
five
--
five
for
the
--
for
an
opinion
including
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
writer
of
the
opinion.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
there
were
five
including
the
writer
of
the
opinion.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
are
not
without
support
because
there
were
three
members
of
the
court
who
--
who
--
had
that
--
that
view
where
they
dissented.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)justice
frankfurter.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you'd
ask
that
lee
be
overruled,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
too
is
a
part
of
your
opinion.
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
position.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
is
a
jury
question
on?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
it's
difficult
to
say
that
in
one
case,
the
tortfeasors
and
the
other
case,
the
officers
act
unconstitutionally,
i
don't
know
what
that
difference
is.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
dissent
--
dissenting
opinion
in
larson
emphasized
it,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
except
that
richard
roe
wasn't
in
that
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
did
it
surprise
you
that
that
was
a
unanimous
opinion?
justice
william
o.
douglas
did
it
surprise
you
that
that
was
a
unanimous
opinion?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
get
it.
what
you're
coming
down
to
really
is
the
vote
of
the
confidence
and
our
ability
to
come
at
this
position
your
way
and
reconcile
all
our
previous
decisions.[laughter]
