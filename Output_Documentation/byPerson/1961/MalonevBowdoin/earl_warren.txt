chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
you
may
have
five
minutes
to
conclude
your
argument
if
you
want
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
you
may
reserve.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
have
that
in
mind
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mitchell
and
you
may
have
--
you
may
have
an
additional
five
minutes,
too,
if
you
--
if
you
should
desire.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
--
i
think
before
we
get
to
that,
we'll
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
continue
to
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
who
you
--
just
who
you
are
trying
to
dispossess,
mr.
mitchell,
this
--
this
respondent
or
--
or
i
mean
this
petitioner
or
the
united
states
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
then
--
then
they'll
be
chasing
you
instead
you
chasing
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
let
--
let
me
ask
--
let
me
ask
you
this
question
this,
mr.
mitchell
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
--
i
don't
ask
your
position.
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
nor
did
i
ask
the
other
question
because
i
want
to
know
this.
suppose
that
this
petitioner
did
walk
off
your
land
and
--
and
announced
to
you
that
he
--
he
no
longer
had
any
possession,
the
united
states
government
put
another
person
in
possession
of
it,
would
your
case
be
mooted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we're
addressing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
jack
jones?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
mitchell,
i
--
i
was
wondering
if
in
seven
--
if
this
was
back
to
the
1700s,
in
the
1700s
in
action
such
as
you
have
brought
here,
would
the
sovereign
have
been
considered
as
a
richard
roe?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
when
did
it
cha
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
--
when
did
it
change
so
that
richard
roe
would
be
considered
whether
government
would
be
considered
richard
roe?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman.
