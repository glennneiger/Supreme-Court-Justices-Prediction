justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
had
made
all
of
these
speeches
after
he
left
the
service,
these
identical
speeches,
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
your
argument
is
based
exclusively
on
constitutional
grounds
or
is
it
based
in
part
on
the
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
all
like
to
have
exactly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you're
referring
only
now
to
those
of
that
time
when
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
not
referring
to
the
other
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
has
been
a
suit
filed
against
admiral
rickover,
the
lateral,
in
connection
with
some
critical
statements
he
made,
is
it
your
argument
that
he
could
have
claimed
immunity
under
the
barr
versus
matteo
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
that
you
are
right
on
that
but
you
presented
in
your
brief
the
reasons
why
the
barr
and
matteo
would
also
refer
to
a
copyrighter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
then
that
the
strength
that
he
had
then
sued
for
libel
for
something
in
here
he
could
not
have
treated
privilege
under
the
barr
and
matteo
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
in
that
connection
is
that
facts
are
different.
you
also
say
as
i
understand
it
that
it
would
not
follow
at
all
because
he
should
be
sued
for
libel
that
he
couldn't
copyright
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
violating
the
copyright
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
clause
says,
“however,
they
may
not
receive
pay
or
other
remuneration
for
the
preparation
of
material
on
which
their
duties
require
them
to
provide
gratuitously.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
that
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
(e)
or
(g)
had
had
--
after
the
sentence
to
which
the
chief
first
referred,
as
to
the
opinions
being
the
private
ones
of
the
writer,
suppose
it
had
gone
on
and
said
and
if
this
is
not
done,
there
can
be
no
copyright
awarded
to
the
writer,
would
you
say
that
would
be
valid
or
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
you
do
not
believe
that
the
government
regulation
could
bar
its
officials
from
taking
advantage
of
the
copyright
law
that
congress
had
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
suppose
he
did,
suppose
he
did
write,
and
then
tried
to
get
it
copyrighted,
would
the
department
of
defense's
orders
determine
his
right
to
get
that
copyright?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
wrote
it
on
the
company
time,
the
company,
i
mean
government
time,
government
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
asking
you
in
connection
with
the
question
i
had
just
asked
you.
suppose
they
--
they
have
said
that
the
man
shall
not
write
on
company
time.
justice

he
shall
not
use

he
shall
not

justice
hugo
l.

and
if
he
does
and
write
something,
he
cannot
get
it
copyrighted.
could
that
be
enforced?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
could
they
--
why
could
they
not
bar
him
from
getting
it
copyrighted?(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
you'd
draw
to
some
extent
on
the
fact
that
the
constitution
provides
the
copyright.
i
don't
know
how
much
that
has
to
do

justice

have
there

any
