mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
here,
we
have
a
man
of
great
intellect
and
enormous
energy,
who
threw
his
work
in
the
navy,
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
what
this
country
needs
is
better
education.
shortly
after
the
second
world
war,
he
had
a
great
fortune
to
be
assigned
to
oakridge
with
a
small
team
to
decide
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
use
the
power
in
connection
with
atomic
fusion
and
he
came
back
recommending
that
it
could
be
used
--
that
it
could
be
used
for
propulsion
of
vessels
and
that
it
could
be
used
and
should
be
used
in
submarines
because
that's
where
it
would
be
the
most
useful.
the
success
of
his
recommendation
attracted
so
much
attention
that
requests
to
make
speeches
came
in
with
regularity.
he
took
these
opportunities
and
in
the
course
of
the
speeches
while
some
of
them
quite
naturally
deal
with
his
experiences
and
the
first
one
was
before
the
metals
congress,
very
natural
that
he
would
talk
to
them
about
the
problems
in
connection
with
metals.
but
practically
every
speech,
i
won't
say
everyone,
but
practically
every
speech
hits
on
this
idea
of
improving
american
education.
now,
i
don't
want
to
spend
too
much
time
on
this
portion
of
it
because
i
have
a
great
deal
to
talk
about
the
matter
of
dedication
in
connection
with
the
case
number
55,
whether
or
not
the
early
speeches
were
dedicated,
but
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
the
first
12
of
these
speeches
were
delivered
before
sputnik
was
fired
and
this
man
anticipated
and
named
the
lead
that
russia
had
and
he
drove
on
the
subject
of
doing
a
better
job
in
this
field
of
education.
in
speech
number
six,
which
was
november
20,
1956
a
year
before
sputnik,
what
concerns
me
most
about
the
russian
school
program
is
not
the
coercive
element,
which
speaks
totalitarian
programs,
but
the
solid
evidence
that
russia
has
found
a
way
to
inspire
her
children
with
the
desire
to
put
forth
their
utmost
mental
efforts.
and
right
after
sputnik,
november
22,
1957,
the
powerful
thrust
of
sputnik's
launching
device
did
more
than
penetrate
outer
space.
it
also
appears
that
thick
armor
and
casing
our
complaisant
in
america's
present
and
future
technological
supremacy.
now,
time
doesn't
permit
an
analysis
of
each
of
these
22
speeches,
but
they
were
all
delivered
with
mounting
emphasis
toward
this
question
of
education
to
such
extent
that
he
drew
down
upon
his
shoulders
the
rest
of
all
the
educators
or
as
he
calls
them
“educationists.”
now,
i
shall
concentrate
in
the
first
part
of
this
argument,
on
the
fact
that
the
speeches
as
written
belong
to
the
admiral,
the
second
half
will
be
that
he
did
not
dedicate
them.
now,
the
first
half
i
divide
as
follows.
first
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
i
think
it's
consistent
with
his
duties.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
it
is
certainly
not
a
part.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
he
was
not
expected
to
make
speeches.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
has
clients
who
make
speeches
when
requested
at
sometimes.
he
could
not
have
been
compelled
to
make
a
speech.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
he
could
not
have
been
compelled
to
make
a
speech.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
i
do
not
think
he
was
following
this
per
se,
but
what
he
did
was
not
inconsistent
with
this,
but
let
me
emphasize
that
when
he
spoke
and
when
he
discussed
subjects
in
connection
with
the
construction
of
these
engines,
the
mode
of
power,
it
was
not
news.
all
of
that
information
has
been
previously
released
in
official
documents.
what
he
said
was
news
worthy
but
he
wasn't
divulging
any
secrets.
i
think
it's
desirable
to
concentrate
on
this
directive,
and
also
on
the
parallel
navy
department,
general
regulation.
and
before
i
seem
to
be
skipping
to
the
navy
regulation,
let
me
turn
mr.
chief
justice
to
part
five
of
the
dod
directive
to
which
you
have
just
referred.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
here,
they
make
a
distinction
between
personnel
who
write
for
outside
publication.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
this
is
what
the
admiral
was
doing,
writing
for
outside
publication.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
he
followed
them
with
respect
to
submitting
the
speeches
for
security
clearance.
he
did
not
follow
them
with
respect
to
stating
that
the
views
expressed
herein
are
those
of
the
writer
and
not
necessarily
those
of
the
navy
department.
he
started
to
do
that
when
this
litigation
reached
the
courthouse.
it
was
inadvertent.
frankly,
i
wish
he
hadn't
included
the
line
on
the
first
speech
in
each
subsequent
one,
but
i'm
sure
that
he
would
not
have
wanted
to
include
such
statement
in
his
speech
because
i'm
sure
that
it
would
have
provoked
laughter.
when
if
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
it
is
very
clear
in
the
statement
of
facts
that
he
used
his
secretary's
services
and
that
he
had
a
secretary
take
the
(inaudible)
master
to
the
mimeograph
room
and
have
the
speeches
processed.
in
that
respect,
there
is
a
technical
violation
of
the
strict
letter
of
these
regulations.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
now,
with
respect
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
first,
respect
to
putting
it
out,
i
think
it's
essential
to
--
to
be
clear
on
the
manner
of
distribution
of
the
speeches.
this
mimeographing
and
distribution
was
handled
very
much
in
the
same
way
as
an
executive
of
any
business
corporation
would
have
his
lecture
to
a
class
or
rest
to
a
business
association
mimeograph
the
company
offices
and
distributed.
i
call
your
attention
to
the
stipulation
in
page
eight
of
the
record.
and
there
in
paragraph
3,
in
less
than
half
of
page
is
the
complete
compass
of
what
was
presented
to
judge
holtzoff
in
the
district
court.
and
this
talks
about
the
press
office
of
the
navy
sending
them
out
in
all
frankness
and
i've
been
in
this
since
the
very
beginning
when
the
complaint
was
served,
the
cover
sheet
is
more
a
happenstance
in
the
(inaudible),
that's
what
they
put
on
top
of
a
speech
to
indicate
the
release
time
and
i
rely
on
this
very
heavily
from
the
standpoint
of
no
dedication
later.
i
say,
it
doesn't
indicate
that
it's
official
and
it
was
not
distributed
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
through
the
press
office
of
the
navy.
paragraph
3
says,
and
i
must
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
they
were
distributed
--
they
were
also
made
available
to
the
press
through
the
public
information
office
of
the
department
of
defense
or
the
atomic
energy
commission
or
both.
the
admiral
took,
most
of
the
burden
of
distributing
these,
he
sent
batches
of
50.
that's
the
element
on
which
mr.
justice
reed
relied
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
sponsor
of
the
speech
where
the
speech
was
to
be
delivered.
this
is
not
to
be
added
to
the
others.
this
is
really
the
package
that
went
out.
now,
in
hindsight
we
can
wish
that
these
were
a
little
more
specific
about
just
who
sent
the
speeches
where.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
i
think
that
that
is
a
slight
exaggeration
of
the
scope
paragraph
3
of
the
statement
of
facts.
i
wish
to
stand
on
paragraph
3
emphasizing
that
this
distribution
was
not
as
wide
as
one
that
would
have
been
the
case
if
the
secretary
of
the
navy
had
sent
one
out.
i
realize
mr.
chief
justice
that
in
this
connection,
i
am
getting
a
bit
of
a
face,
because
of
the
language
of
this
paragraph
3.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
well,
in
paragraph
3
it
does
say
that
they
were
made
available
--
this
is
on
page
8
of
the
transcript
of
the
record.
it
does
say
that
they
were
distributed
through
the
public
information
office
of
the
department
of
defense.
now
how
many
were
distributed
is
not
a
matter
of
record,
believe
it
or
not.
this
is
hard
to
say.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
yes,
there
will
be
a
remand
that
this
should
be
affirmed
to
determine
the
extent
to
which,
this
plaintiff,
petitioner
in
36
may
use
the
protected
speeches
now.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
they
did
reverse
on
dedication.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
and
said
that
nevertheless
some
of
these
speeches
were
properly
protected.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
i'm
--
i'd
like
to
agree
with
you,
but
i
must
say
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
recognized
that
in
some
of
the
speeches,
the
admiral's
rights
as
a
copyright
owner
were
unquestioned
because
they
said
he
did
not
write
it
pursuant
to
orders.
he
properly
copyrighted
them.
this
is
beginning
with
number
23,
and
therefore
he
may
restrict
their
use
and
that's
what
he
put
back
to
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
exactly
so
your
honor.
now,
my
point
is
that
the
issuance
of
writing,
the
making
of
speeches
is
encouraged
by
the
department
as
a
matter
of
good
personnel
relations
as
well
as
affording
an
opportunity
for
the
public
to
be
informed.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
it
would
relate
to
all
of
those
commencing
with
the
speech
number
23
which
was
made
december
11,
1958.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
well
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
he
has
made
a
total
of
36
speeches
by
this
time,
yes,
13
of
them
since
the
litigation.
those
have
been
individually
copyrighted.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
believe
it
or
not
your
honor,
i'm
going
to
have
to
advice
you
about
that
when
we
come
back
at
10
o'clock
in
the
morning.
i
really
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
i
have
--
this
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
have
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
you
see,
this
record
was
based
on
a
situation
that
existed
as
of
december
1959,
october
1959
when
the
case
was
tried.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
well,
this
is
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
no,
i
would
not
and
i
also
must
concede
that
there
are
two
methods
of
distribution
here,
one,
through
the
public
information
office
and
the
other
by
the
admiral.
i
do
not
wish
to
confuse
the
situation
by
attempting
now
to
minimize
this
distribution.
i
will
stand
on
that
statement.
now,
if
i
may
return
to
your
question
about
what
they
arrived
at
during
trial.
the
minute
this
suit
started,
there
were
many
requests
for
notices
to
produce,
examination
before
trial
and
with
this
busy
defendant
trying
very
hard
not
to
wrap
the
flag
around
him,
i
took
the
position
with
judge
holtzoff
that
there
were
not
many
facts
that
would
require
examination
of
defendants
during
the
trial
or
before
trial
that
we
could
concede,
we
could
admit,
we
could
possibly
stipulate.
so
we
started
to
draft
a
stipulation
and
we
responded
to
request
to
admit.
and
on
the
eve
of
the
date
of
the
trial,
we
were
still
without
a
signed
stipulation
but
nevertheless
i
went
in
with
one,
this
one
containing
the
inelegant
phrasing.
practically,
complete
so
that
judge
holtzoff
said,
“well
what's
all
the
argument?
what's
left?”
and
there
were
only
two
points
and
mr.
brush
trying
the
case
for
public
affairs
press
and
i
arrived
at
the
two
missing
links
in
what
is,
what
purports
to
be
a
complete
statement
of
facts.
frankly,
i
wish
it
were
more
specific
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
your
honor,
you
have
before
you
the
question
of
his
right
to
write
and
my
only
hesitation,
my
understanding
is
that
since
this
litigation,
the
cover
sheet
does
not
bear
their
banner
but
i
am
not
sure
enough
of
it
if
you
say
so.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
he
is,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
but
you
see
at
present
and
ever
since
the
litigation
or
since
december
1958,
he
has
copyrighted
each
speech
individually.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
may
i
say
your
honor
that
if
there
is
a
banner
there
now,
it's
with
the
government's
acquiescence.
they've
known
about
this
for
three
years
and
have
not
moved
in
on
it.
each
one
is
individually
copyrighted
and
not
objected
to
by
his
superiors.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
these
elements
of
the
use
of
facilities,
secretarial
and
otherwise
have
been
characterized
by
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
being
minor
and
not
affecting
the
basic
question
of
who
owns
the
material.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
the
admiral
arranged
his
itinerary
so
that
he
was
able
to
make
these
speeches
in
connection
with
the
many
(inaudible)
required
by
his
work
and
that
too
was
mentioned
in
the
statement.
there
was
not
an
extra
dollar
of
transportation
paid
by
the
government
just
to
make
a
speech.
but
particularly
in
the
years
1955
to
1958,
he
was
all
over
the
country
on
short
notice
and
you'll
note
in
the
speech
that
they're
written
at
home
or
while
traveling
because
he
did
so
much
of
it.
i
think
that
the
only
way
to
look
at
the
government
participation
whether
it's
a
secretarial
service
or
airplane
travel
is
that
it
is
a
minor
part
of
the
entire
picture.
the
question
is
was
this
man
hired
to
write?
was
he
expected
to
write?
was
he
told
to
write
and
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
both
courts
have
agreed
on
that,
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
no,
that
was
not
part
of
his
work.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
i
am
sure
he
could
not.
first,
i
take
the
question
even
though
i
know
he
wouldn't
think
of
raising
it,
but
if
he
had
i'm
sure
he
would
lose
that
because
this
is
so
clearly
not
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
i
don't
believe
so.
barr
against
matteo
involved
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
--
a
memorandum
issued
by
a
government
official
consistent
with
his
employment.
he
didn't
have
to
do
it
but
he
exercises
judgment
and
did
it
and
so
he
couldn't
hide
behind
the
protection
of
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
no.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
well,
conceivably
if
the
party
defamed,
knew
as
much
about
the
law
as
mr.
rosenfield,
he
might
be
discouraged
by
the
existence
of
the
label
and
the
official
appearance.
he
might
say,
“no,
you'll
have
a
perfect
defense.”
i
guess
he
would
have
to
sue.
he
has
to
go
to
a
lawyer
and
ask
and
inquire.
but
as
i
see
it,
there's
a
great
distinction
between
an
administrative
officer
who
issues
a
memorandum
as
a
matter
of
his
own
exercise
of
discretion
which
can
be
said
to
be
consistent
with
his
authority
and
this
defendant,
petitioner
in
55,
who
has
this
burning
desire
to
get
a
message
across
to
people
and
goes
out
making
speeches.
he's
not
speaking
for
the
government.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
but
his
--
this
housing
administrator's
action
was
running
hand
and
hand
with
his
duties,
his
duties
as
a
disciplinarian
in
the
department.
the
admiral's
speeches
are
obviously
made
to
gatherings
to
express
his
own
point
of
view.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
i
think
his
action
there
were
--
was
more
closely
related
to
his
official
duties
than
these
speeches
to
the
admiral.
i
see
very
little
connection
between
these
speeches
in
the
admiral's
duties.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
no
your
honor.
the
most
significant
letter
has
already
been
referred
to,
the
one
from
secretary
of
the
navy,
then
gates,
to
mr.
schnapper
chief
executive
of
the
petitioner
in
36.
that's
dated
december
20
of
1958,
less
than
a
month
before
this
litigation
was
commenced
and
it
said,
your
letters
concerning
the
matter
of
placing
copyright
notice
on
lectures
on
education
by
admiral
rickover
had
been
received.
admiral
rickover
has
obtained
his
copyright
as
a
private
citizen,
not
in
connection
with
his
official
capacity.
therefore,
i
do
not
deem
it's
proper
for
the
department
of
the
navy
to
render
a
legal
opinion
as
to
its
validity.
should
you
wish
to
challenge
the
validity
of
admiral
rickover's
copyright,
you
are
of
course
certainly
free
to
do
so
insofar
as
the
department
of
the
navy
is
concerned
and
it
was
thereafter
that
mr.
schnapper
went
to
the
court.
this
is
to
my
way
of
thinking
a
complete
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
may
i
say
in
that
connection,
that
in
view
of
what
he
said
about
the
curriculum
of
the
naval
academy,
in
view
of
what
he
said
about
the
department
of
defense's
attitude
on
patents,
and
with
respect
to
the
rotation
of
senior
officers
and
the
desirability
of
unifying
the
services.
it
must
be
clear
that
if
they
were
picking
a
spokesman,
he
would
be
one
of
the
last,
if
not
the
last
chosen
as
the
department's
spokesman.
these
speeches
therefore
as
i
see
it
were
entirely
the
admiral's,
people
hearing
him,
knew
that
he
was
speaking
his
own
mind
and
they,
therefore,
should
not
be
considered
as
having
belonged
to
the
government.
and
the
interpretation
placed
on
these
speeches
by
the
superintendent
of
documents
is
interesting.
it
may
not
be
controlling.
i
think
this
is
a
question
of
law
that
has
to
be
decided
by
a
court,
and
now
by
this
court.
but,
i
regarded
as
extremely
important
that
the
monthly
catalog
of
government
publications,
which
lists
many
publications
including
process
publications,
meaning,
those
which
are
not
printed
by
the
conventional
method,
but
including
multi
(inaudible),
those
catalogs
do
not
include
at
any
of
these
speeches.
and
the
requirement
is,
as
stated
right
on
the
cover
of
the
monthly
catalog.
under
the
provisions
of
the
printing
act
of
january
12
1895,
all
government
publications
are
listed
in
the
monthly
catalog.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
i
believe
this
is
extremely
important
too.
they
do
not
bear
an
official
number.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
and
this
is
a
lack
of
appreciation
of
what
is
an
official
number.
the
number
that
you
see
on
the
top
of
those
speeches
is
followed
by
a
year
date.
this
is
just
a
multi
living
job,
a
job
number
in
the
multi-list
department.
and
in
the
text,
which
is
cited
by
mr.
rosenfield,
void
and
rips
on
government
publications,
the
1949
edition
52
re-print,
which
i
have.
on
page
210
it
says,
“in
dealing
with
navy
department
publications,
since
world
war
ii,
there
have
been
so
many
publications
of
the
department
that
each
navy
publication,
there
is
a
symbol
indicating
the
issuing
bureau
followed
by
a
number.”
for
example,
navpers,
n-a-v-p-e-r-s,
it's
capital
letters
and
then
a
number,
navmed
for
the
medical
code.
and
for
the
bureau
of
ships
in
which
the
admiral
serves,
navships,
and
in
this
government
catalog
you
will
find
subdivisions
so
that
under
navy,
you'll
come
to
view
ship,
but
under
view
ship
nothing
with
respect
to
the
admiral's
speeches,
so
for
what
it
is
worth,
the
superintendent
of
documents
doesn't
list
them.
and
the
semi-annual
list
of
periodicals
released
as
statistical
statements
which
up
until
february
of
1961
was
carried
in
the
catalog
of
government
publications
are
headed.
all
publications
received
by
the
division
of
public
documents
library
are
listed
in
this
portion.
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
nature
of
the
speeches
from
the
standpoint
of
containing
technical
information.
as
indicated
in
the
brief,
the
data
concerning
the
development
of
nuclear
power
particularly
in
connection
with
the
shipping
ports
speech
which
is
i
see
it
is
the
most
technical
one
of
the
whole
list.
that
is
on
page
46
and
47
of
our
brief,
gives
information
concerning
the
extent
to
which
the
data
was
already
in
the
hands
of
the
public.
now,
the
second
and
third
parts
of
my
opening
half
of
this
argument
are
designed
to
stress
the
fact
that
this
was
not
an
impairment
of
the
public's
right
to
know
and
that
it
acted
for
the
benefit
of
the
department
and
the
country
for
him
to
speak.
much
has
been
made
about
the
difficulty
of
this
fair
use
concept.
and
i
will
grant
that
in
many
cases
it's
difficult
to
determine
just
how
much
had
been
use
is
fair,
but
this
is
something
which
depends
on
each
particular
situation.
and
i
am
sure
that
in
this
situation
where
the
admiral
distributes
press
releases,
hold
press
releases,
hold
for
release
until
so
and
so,
it's
obvious
that
the
press
that
is
the
newspapers
and
the
news
periodicals
can
certainly
take,
they're
invited
to
take.
even
if
he
didn't
have
at
the
foot,
no
permission
needed
when
newspaper
or
news
periodical
use
right
above
the
copyright
notice,
the
newspapers
could
still
use
that
material
because
it
is
news
worthy.
they
could
cover
the
speech
by
saying,
“last
night
admiral
rickover
said”
and
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
any
copyright
under
those
circumstances
would
be
able
successfully
to
proceed
against
the
newspaper.
now,
it's
also
essential
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
copyright
does
intend
to
bottle
up
any
this
information.
the
information
itself,
the
ideas
conveyed
in
the
speeches
can
be
used
by
anyone,
people
other
than
newspaper
publishers,
the
writers
of
a
book.
this
plaintiff,
petitioner
in
number
36
could
have
written
a
book
and
describe
what
rickover
thinks
and
use
elements
from
his
speeches
to
the
greatest
extent
he'd
wished
without
running
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
--
without
filing
the
copyright
law
because
he
would
be
discussing
principally
in
his
own
words,
what
the
admiral
had
said,
if
he
lifted
large
quotations,
he
would
have
some
latitude
there,
but
there's
a
tremendous
difference
between
merely
taking
excerpts
and
doing
what
the
plaintiff-petitioner
in
36
intended
to
do,
publish
the
speeches.
as
indicated
in
exhibit
5,
the
letter
from
mr.
edmondson
the
vice
--
the
executive
vice
president
of
the
(inaudible),
the
publisher
of
the
admiral's
book
education
and
freedom
based
on
the
first
nine
or
ten
of
these
speeches.
it
would
be
very
unfortunately
he
said
to
mr.
schnapper
following
up
on
schnapper's
threat
to
sue
the
admiral
if
he
didn't
get
permission.
it
would
be
very
unfortunate
to
have
two
volumes
of
the
speeches
on
the
bookshelves
currently.
this
would
be
a
disorganized
approach
and
what
the
admiral
did
was
rewrite
the
nine
to
form
the
basis
for
his
education
and
freedom.
and
that's
an
important
consideration
because
no
man
likes
to
have
a
collection
of
20
speeches
unedited
put
out
in
the
batch.
at
the
end
of
three
years
this
is
what
rickover
thinks
to
take
that
title
as
an
example.
i
think
this
would
be
unfair,
because
if
he
wants
people
to
see
in
a
book
what
he
thinks,
he'll
present
it
in
book
form.
there's
a
tremendous
difference
between
the
two
media.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
i
believe
it
does.
it
--
the
complaint
in
the
action
for
declaratory
judgment
is
certainly
broad
enough
to
do
so,
paragraph
5
of
the
complaint.
and
while
the
original
letter
from
schnapper
to
admiral
rickover,
said
that
he
wanted
to
quote
from
them
in
the
fourth
coming
book.
you
will
find
on
page
6
of
the
transcript
that
contemporaneous
with
the
request
in
writing,
there
were
telephone
conversations
between
the
parties
meaning
schnapper
and
rickover,
whereby
the
plaintiff
shnapper
that
is,
made
it
clear
the
he
wished
to
publish
the
defendant's
speeches.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
after
yesterday's
session,
i
checked
the
file
with
respect
to
the
current
practice
as
to
the
cover
sheets
on
the
speeches
and
found
there
is
no
banner,
navy
or
aec.
none
has
been
used.
no
cover
sheet
with
a
banner
has
been
used
since
--
prior
to
december
1st,
1958
when
that
first
speech
was
copyrighted
individually,
the
one
for
delivery
on
december
11.
the
distribution
of
the
speeches
was
also
changed
at
that
time
so
that
from
that
date,
they
were
not
available
through
the
public
information
of
the
--
public
information
office
of
the
navy.
inquiries
now
made
to
the
public
information
office
are
referred
to
the
admiral's
office,
and
the
admiral's
office
distributes
these
multi
list
speeches
of
which
i
have
copies
here.
they
are
on
plain
white
paper,
headed
with
the
disclaimer,
and
the
language
concerning
the
release,
the
identification
of
the
sponsorship,
and
the
fact
that
the
admiral
has
prepared
these
remarks
for
public
delivery.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
it
started
with
the
speech
prepared
for
december
11,
1958,
and
that
was
the
first
one
to
be
copyrighted.
it
was
copyrighted
individually
and
for
that
purpose
was
put
on
plain
white
paper.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
no,
i
would
like
make
it
clear
your
honor
that
we
do
not
concede
that
these
changes
were
necessary
for
the
successful
maintenance
of
our
position
as
to
individual
ownership
in
the
admiral.
but
they
were
affected
frankly
to
remove
any
vestige
of
a
question
and
to
put
that
much
at
rest.
the
disclaimer
was
commenced
may
i
add
for
the
first
time
on
october
29th,
1959
and
of
course,
we
concede
that
that
was
required
by
the
language
of
the
navy
regulation
and
its
omission
prior
to
that
time
was
an
oversight.
i
made
a
statement
yesterday
that
the
admiral's
duties
did
not
include
the
issuances
--
the
issuance
of
press
releases.
and
that
is
correct.
i
checked
with
him
on
that
as
well
as
the
speech
handling
and
was
advised
that
he
has
never
issued
one
on
behalf
of
the
navy.
now
occasionally
of
course,
members
of
the
press
will
approach
him
and
you
frequently
see
his
name
in
the
papers,
but
this
is
not
pursuant
to
a
press
release
which
he
has
put
out.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
december
1st,
1958,
that
was
the
first
speech
made
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
no
sir.
it
was
post
the
contact
by
schnapper
to
the
admiral
in
october
1958.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
litigation
was
in
the
air,
and
the
complaint
was
filed
january
16th,
1959.
with
respect
to
whether
the
petitioner
in
number
36
wished
merely
to
quote
from
the
speeches
rather
than
to
publish
them
in
full,
i
want
to
be
sure
you
realize
that.
while
the
exhibit
number
1,
the
letter
from
schnapper
to
admiral
rickover
ends
with
the
statement
i
am
very
anxious
to
quote
from
them
in
the
forthcoming
book.
contemporaneous
with
that
request
as
memorialized
in
the
statement
of
facts,
page
6
of
the
record.
there
were
telephone
conversations,
this
is
page
6,
middle
of
the
page,
contemporaneous
with
that
request,
there
were
telephone
conversations
between
the
parties
whereby
the
plaintiff
made
it
clear
that
he
wished
to
publish
the
defendant's
speeches.
in
paragraph
5
of
the
complaint
which
appears
at
the
foot
of
record
3,
says
in
its
second
sentence,
the
plaintiff
desires
to
publish
such
speeches
as
have
been
made
by
the
defendant.
i
think
of
paramount
importance
here
is
the
fact
that
the
--
in
addition
to
the
department
of
defense
directive
which
is
reproduced
on
the
record
page
99
to
103
in
which
it
says
in
its
paragraph
5,
top
of
page
102
of
the
record,
personnel
who
write
for
outside
publication
not
in
connection
with
their
official
duties
on
any
subject
shall
ascertain
and
so
forth
that
it
will
not
interfere
with
their
regular
duties,
the
navy
manual,
a
public
information
manual,
which
is
reproduced
on
page
7a
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
in
55,
u.s.
navy
public
information
manual,
an
official
publication
of
the
department
labeled
(inaudible)
p1035,
article
0514
provides
in
its
sub
(a),
within
the
bounds
of
security,
the
writing
of
articles,
speeches
and
similar
material
intended
for
publication
on
topics
of
military
and
professional
interest
is
desirable
and
so
authorized
and
in
(b),
commanders
will
provide
full
cooperation
compatible
with
military
security
and/or
assistants
in
the
preparation
of
such
material.
but
the
important
one
is
in
sub
(e)
over
on
page
8a,
“military
and
civilian
personnel
may
receive
pay
for
private
literary
effort”.
this
is
a
very
clear
recognition
that
personnel
are
encouraged
to
write
and
to
own
what
they
write
else
they
could
hardly
receive
pay
for
it.
it
adds
in
that
sentence
to
complete
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
thank
you,
i
should
have
added
that
myself.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
this
means
that
where
they
are
required,
if
the
admiral
had
been
required
to
make
the
speech,
then
he
could
not
demand
any
pay
for
it.
these
rounds
out
the
sentence,
first,
they
may
receive
pay
for
private
literary
effort
but
they
may
not
receive
pay
or
any
other
remuneration
for
the
preparation
of
material
required
by
their
duties.
i
think
this
makes
a
fine
distinction
between
the
two
types
of
writing,
one
pursuant
to
orders
or
inline
of
duty
and
the
other
aside
--
outside
the
line
of
duty,
as
a
private
undertaking.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
incorporates
in
this
directive
or
manual
the
language
of
navy
regulation
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
--
in
1252
we
previously
referred
to.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
the
disclaimer
did
not
appear
on
the
early
ones,
that
is
correct.
that
was
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
they
do.
they
have
ever
since
october
1959.
the
first
speech
made
after
the
trial
at
which
this
came
out
and
i
realized
that
it
was
an
oversight
and
the
admiral
commenced
to
include
the
disclaimer
on
the
printed
copy.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
and
that
was
done,
yes
your
honor.
in
addition,
the
defense
director
was
complied
with,
requiring
that
the
material
be
submitted
for
security
review.
each
of
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
--
speeches,
from
the
very
first
one,
contains
a
stamp
of
clearance.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
i
think
that
would
be
an
attempt
your
honor
to
alter
the
statute
and
the
laws
--
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
it
now
exists.
i
don't
believe
that
the
government
regulation
could've
done
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
well,
i'll
say
this.
the
department
in
my
opinion
could
have
ordered
the
admiral
not
to
write.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
in
my
opinion,
they
would
not.
he'd
be
subject
to
discipline
but
his
writing
assuming
and
obviously
this
was
contrary
to
orders
not
pursuant
to
orders,
that
would
be
his
own
work.
he
would
own
it.
he'd
be
able
to
copyright
it,
and
he'd
be
subject
to
disciplinary
action.
such
a
prohibition
--
such
an
order
not
to
write
would
not
affect
his
rights
in
the
material
he
wrote
contrary
to
orders.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
now
get
into
an
area,
but
i
feel
very
sure
of
this,
this
is
a
man
who
works
around
the
clock
and
around
the
calendar.
he
really
doesn't
have
any
office
hours,
and
i,
presently,
well-aware
of
this
.as
the
stipulation
says,
he
wrote
it
on
the
plane,
in
hotel
rooms,
at
home,
while
traveling,
and
it's
just
--
if
you
will
pardon
the
characterization,
a
human
dynamo
or
perhaps
i
should
say
a
human
reactor
and
he
is
always
on
the
go.
i
don't
know
how
you'd
pin
this
man
down
to
office
hours
and
i
think
that
comes
to
be
more
of
a
--
i
hate
to
call
it
a
detail,
but
it
doesn't
go
to
the
heart
of
the
matter.
when
a
man
has
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
oh,
then
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
and
if
they
really
made
him
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
he
would
still
merely,
in
my
opinion,
be
subject
to
being
disciplined
for
disobeying
the
order
not
to
write
on
government
time.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
because
they
have
in
effect
told
him
not
to
write
this
material
at
this
time
and
place.
he
has
disobeyed
that
order.
he
--
what
he
has
done
has
been
done
by
himself
in
violation
of
an
order.
this
is
all
the
more
reason
that
the
material
belongs
to
him
which
he
wrote
in
violation
of
the
order.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
i'm
so
--
i'm
so
sorry,
but
this
is
fundamental
that
the
copyright
statute
is
based
on
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
article
1,
section
8,
clause
8,
authorizes
congress
to
enact
statutes
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
useful
arts
to
encourage
authors
and
inventors
and
enable
them
to
get
the
exclusive
right
to
their
writings
and
their
discoveries.
this
is
a
right
of
the
admiral
and
it
could
be
altered
in
my
opinion
by
putting
his
employment,
his
career
on
the
line
by
violating
an
order,
but
nobody
could
take
away
from
him
his
right
to
own
what
he
does
write.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
oh
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
not
in
violation
of
government
orders.
i
don't
believe
so.
two
of
the
cases
have
resulted
in
the
material
written
by
the
employee
belonging
to
the
government,
heine
against
appleton
and
sawyer
against
crowell-collier
where
the
men
in
sawyer
against
crowell-collier
really
used
government
personnel
who
were
subordinates
to
prepare
the
map
in
question.
heine
against
appleton
was
a
man
engaged
to
prepare
sketches
in
connection
with
commodore
perry's
explorations.
and
when
he
claimed
that
he
owned
the
sketches
and
know
the
part
of
your
contract
was
that
you
would
make
these
sketches
for
the
expedition.
so
they
belonged
to
the
government.
but
i
don't
know
of
any
case
where
a
man
was
ordered
not
to
write
and
did
so.
but
i
feel
very
sincerely
that
in
violating
the
order,
he
would
subject
himself
to
discipline
but
what
he
wrote
would
be
his.
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
it
and
a
statutory
right
to
it,
because
the
copyright
statute
in
protecting
works
which
are
copyrighted
also
recognizes
in
its
section
2
the
common
law
rights
of
authors
in
there
writings
up
to
the
time
that
they
are
published.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
there
were
orders
there
that
he
should
not
write.
i
--
if
there
were,
i
think
he
would
still
own
what
he
wrote.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
may
i
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
may
i
point
out
that
the
admiral
was
charged
with
concealment
of
some
sort
at
the
time
he
deposited
on
december
1st,
1958
a
compilation
of
the
first
22
speeches
in
order
to
have
them
copyrighted
if
possible
as
a
compilation.
now,
in
that
case
of
course,
each
speech
was
redone
to
leave
out
the
banner.
it
was
retyped
on
plain
paper
and
this
was
very
natural.
he
didn't
claim
to
own
the
material
in
the
banner,
what
he
claimed
to
own
was
the
words
he
had
written.
he
couldn't
begin
to
copyright
that
banner.
he
took
off
the
cover
the
sheet,
had
the
text
on
that
page
retyped
and
incorporated
all
22
of
them
in
a
compilation
which
was
deposited
for
copyright.
now
frankly,
i'm
not
going
to
spend
a
minute
on
the
nature
of
that
copyright
unless
you
wish
because
i
will
concede
that
copyright
in
a
compilation
doesn't
give
the
depositor
anymore
rights
than
he
had
in
the
individual
components
of
the
compilation.
but,
i
do
want
to
point
that
connected
with
that
there
was
some
intimation
here
that
the
register
of
copyrights
had
conspired
with
the
secretary
of
the
navy
to
buckle
up
this
material
which
should
have
been
government
material
and
prevented
its
use
by
publishers
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
and
this
is
absolutely
contrary
to
the
fundamental
concepts
of
the
copyright
law.
the
register
of
copyrights
doesn't
hand
out
copyright.
you
obtain
copyright
in
this
country
in
published
works
by
publishing
the
work
with
a
notice
of
copyright
in
the
proper
place.
it's
as
simple
as
that.
you
don't
have
to
go
near
the
copyright
office.
frankly,
you
don't.
the
mere
fact
of
publication
with
notice
gives
you
copyright
for
28
years.
now
the
statute
does
say
that
promptly,
thereafter,
you
must
deposit.
and
you
must
deposit
with
a
claim
with
an
application
for
registration
of
your
claim
to
copyright.
now,
there
was
some
reference
to
an
18
month
rule.
this
is
really
not
so.
i'm
not
quibbling
about
the
fact
that
in
that
particular
case,
approximately
18
months,
i
think
it
was
14.
it
makes
no
difference
but
there's
no
particular
deadline
within
which
you
must
file
your
work
with
an
application
for
registration
of
your
claim.
the
washingtonian
case,
306
u.s.
says,
“that
it
cannot
--
the
copyright
cannot
be
defeated
by
such
a
delay.”
as
a
practical
matter,
in
as
much
as
you
have
to
accompany
a
complaint
in
infringement
with
proof
that
you've
acquired
a
copyright,
you
have
to
file
an
application
and
get
a
certified
copy
thereof
to
attach
to
your
complaints
so
the
practical
requirement
is
that
you
must
apply
the
copyright
before
you
sue
and
nobody
can
say
what
that
is.
i
personally
think
it
could
be
27th
of
the
28
years.
now,
this
is
brings
me
to
the
point
where
i
have
hardly
time
to
press
on
your
attention,
the
part
of
this
case
on
which
we
are
appealing.
we've
been
discussing
the
very
interesting
and
important
main
point.
but
mr.
justice
reed
and
judge
danaher
agreed
with
him
in
a
divided
court,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
reversed
judge
holtzoff
with
respect
to
the
dedicatory
effect
of
the
distribution
in
the
form
of
press
releases
of
the
early
speeches.
i
really
feel
that
this
was
error.
mr.
justice
reed's
opinion
refers
to
the
fact
that
taking
the
whole
thing
in
the
round
including
the
fact
that
there
was
performance
here,
and
so
many
copies
here
and
so
many
copies
here.
it
involved
a
dedication.
the
first
place
performance
alone
is
not
a
dedication.
the
distribution
of
the
copies
only
can
constitute
a
dedication.
you
can
put
a
play
on
broadway,
not
copyrighted,
no
dedication.
no
dedication
until
you
distribute
copies.
i
urged
upon
you
a
consideration
of
an
interesting
case,
white
against
kimmel
which
is
decided
10
years
ago
in
california.
judge
yankwich
writing
made
a
remarkable
survey
of
the
law
of
dedication
through
wide
publication.
in
that
case,
a
book
was
involved.
don't
forget
that
here
a
speech
was
involved
and
there
is
a
difference.
the
speech
is
prepared
for
oral
delivery
and
when
you
distribute
it
in
a
form
of
a
press
release,
it's
for
the
convenience
of
the
press
to
let
people
know
what
you
plan
to
say.
and
i
will
say
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
judge
yankwich,
they
did
so
without
citing
a
single
case.
they
praised
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
remarkably
clear
and
comprehensive
review
of
the
law
with
respect
to
a
dedicatory
divestitive
type
of
distribution
of
copies.
but
they
said
he
had
stretched
the
facts
a
little
bit.
there
was
a
dispute
whether
75
or
200
copies
had
been
distributed
and
they
said
that
in
this
case
that
he
had
gone
just
a
little
too
far.
they
said
this
case
of
the
books
distributed
by
the
writer
in
white
against
kimmel
is
not
thought
to
be
comparable
with
those
cases
involving
publication
of
lecture
notes
or
the
distribution
of
copies
of
a
minister
sermon
among
the
members
of
his
congregation.
it
is
by
such
assimilation
that
the
trial
court
endeavors
to
satisfy
the
criterion.
but
white,
in
distributing
these
books,
white
does
not
appear
in
the
record
as
a
teacher
or
as
a
propagandist
endeavoring
to
persuade.
he
is
not
pictured
as
a
man
with
a
message.
i
sincerely
feel
that
rickover
is
a
man
with
a
message.
if
rickover's
speeches
had
been
before
judge
yankwich,
he
would
obviously
have
decided
the
case
exactly
as
he
did
in
white
against
kimmel.
and
i
believe,
giving
due
attention
to
the
language
as
expressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
itself
that
if
rickover
speeches
had
been
there
involved,
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
have
reversed
yankwich
and
therefore
i
commend
to
you
judge
yankwich's
decision
in
that
case
and
the
treatment
of
it
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
it's
a
very
long
opinion
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
--
but
it's
fascinating.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
they
decided
that
the
notes
kept
by
captain
lewis
of
the
lewis
and
clark
expedition
which
later
proved
to
be
very
valuable
after
they
have
had
been
found
in
a
trunk
in
somebody's
attic
in
saint
paul
had
been
written
by
captain
lewis
not
as
a
part
of
his
regular
duties
on
the
expedition.
captain
clark
had
been
enjoined
by
president
jefferson
to
keep
careful
notes
and
make
a
report
because
they
realized
they
were
working
on
the
purchase
at
the
time.
they
realized
that
this
would
be
of
great
future
importance
to
the
country,
but
what
happened
was
that
formal
reports
were
duly
sent
to
washington,
but
then
these
other
notes
which
judge
nordbye
in
his
beautiful
opinion
though
somewhat
long
said
was
the
private
writings
of
lewis.
and
therefore
when
they
were
found
in
an
attic
and
traced
to
an
indian
office
in
oklahoma
where
lewis
was
between
then
--
between
his
expedition
and
his
retirement,
stationed
in
the
office
of
indian
affairs,
these
were
pieces
of
personal
property
that
belonged
to
his
successor
who
found
them
in
the
old
desk
in
oklahoma,
took
them
home
to
saint
paul
and
he
retired,
and
the
descendant
of
his
found
him
in
the
attic.
they
didn't
belong
to
the
government
and
its
important
your
honor
that
in
that
case,
the
united
states
really
got
in
there
and
pitch.
they
made
a
great
claim
for
these
documents
and
they
lost
the
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
just
praised
judge
nordbye's
opinion
and
said
this
is
a
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcdonald
it
did
sir.
