mr.
rosenfield,
you
may
proceed
with
your
arguments.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rosenfield,
there
are
certain
regulations
of
the
department
of
defense
concerning
press
releases,
i
say
they've
quoted
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
record.
i'm
looking
at
page
100
now.
were
those
proceedings
followed
in
these
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
know
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcdonald.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask
mr.
mcdonald,
is
this
consistent
with
--
in
the
party
apart
from
his
duties
as
an
admiral
in
the
navy
with
the
responsibility
he
has
in
these
two
positions
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
a
part
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
everybody
does
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
ask
that
is
because
i'm
looking
at
this
regulation
on
page
100
of
the
record
where
it
says,
“the
people
of
the
united
states
are
properly
interested
in
the
department
of
defense
and
the
steps
it
is
taking
to
protect
the
national
security.
the
department
of
defense
has
an
obligation
to
inform
the
public
with
respect
to
the
department's
activities
and
to
provide
the
public
with
accurate,
factual,
and
other
proper
information
regarding
the
army,
navy,
airforce
and
marine
corps
and
then
the
public
access
shall
be
limited
only
by
restrictions
imposed
in
the
national
interest
pursuant
to
law
in
order
to
safeguard
information
requiring
protection
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense.
now,
was
he
--
was
he
pursuing
that
general
policy
of
the
department
when
he
delivered
these
speeches
and
when
the
--
the
information
officer
sent
them
out
as
a
--
as
a
press
release
from
the
department
of
defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
follow
those
regulations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
follow
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead,
did
he
follow
the
course
of
it,
which
said
that
he
shouldn't'
use
government
personnel
or
to
do
these
things?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
isn't
the
--
isn't
he
putting
it
out
by
the
press
officer,
isn't
that
a
part
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
using
the
personnel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
mr.
rosenfield
to
say
there
was
no
difference
of
opinion
between
you
on
the
facts
and
that
this
press
release
was
in
no
respect
different
from
the
normal
press
release
in
the
department
and
then
it
went
through
the
same
channels
to
the
same
people.
now,
is
that
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
travel
--
travel
pay
that
--
travel
expenses
that
the
government
paid
on
when
he
delivered
these
speeches,
is
that
a
certain
material?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
his
province
or
was
he
supposed
to
make
these
releases
on
any
subject
at
any
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
make
any
press
releases
of
any
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
is
it
involved?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
does
a
--
how
does
a
private
citizen
know
whether
--
whether
he
has
a
right
in
--
in
court,
in
a
libel
case
in
connection
with
the
press
release
of
an
admiral
if
they
come
out
in
exactly
the
same
form
and
they're
prepared
in
the
same
way,
the
same
facilities
are
used
and
--
and
the
travel
is
at
the
expense
of
the
government,
the
same
in
each
case?
how
does
a
private
citizen
know
how
to
--
how
to
be
guided
in
that
situation?
does
he
has
to
go
through
a
lawsuit
before
he
finds
that
this
wasn't
the
real
press
release
even
though
it
had
the
imprimatur
of
the
defense
department
or
is
there
someway
he
can
know
beforehand
so
he
know
his
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you'd
hardly
say
that
this
little
administrative
officer
in
the
housing
--
in
a
housing
project
would
have
greater
power
and
authority
then
the
admiral
with
these
two
titles
that
he
has
or
that
he
would
have
a
greater
range
of
discretion
under
barr
versus
matteo
which
says
that
even
if
it
comes
within
the
perimeter
of
his
duties
then
he
has
a
right
to
make
a
press
release
and
has
absolute
immunity
from
libel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
let's
go
to
howard
versus
lyons.
now,
he
wasn't
disciplining
an
officer
there.
he
was
--
he
is
going
outside
and
he
was
disciplining
citizens
for
having
criticized,
his
administration
of
a
navy
post.
have
you
--
have
you
distinguished
that
and
he
did
that
not
because
he
was
obliged
to
do
that,
because
he
had
some
general
powers
within
the
perimeter
of
his
duties
to
make
whatever
press
releases
he
thought
were
good
for
the
service.
and
he
did
and
this
court
held
that
he
was
immune
from
libel,
absolutely
immune.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering
mr.
mcdonald,
why
if
it
was
totally
unofficial,
would
the
press
officer
in
releasing
it,
give
it
an
official
number?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
mr.
rosenfield
to
say
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
mcdonald.
chief
justice
earl
warren
associates,
incorporated,
versus
vice
admiral
hyman
g.
rickover
and
number
55,
vice
admiral
hyman
g.
rickover,
versus
public
affairs
associates.
mr.
mcdonald.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
in
your
opinion
makes
a
substantial
legal
difference
between
the
two,
mr.
mcdonald?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
does
require
that
he
--
when
that
is
done
that
the
--
i'm
looking
at
(g)
now
on
the
same
page,
that
caused
their
signature
to
appear
on
such
articles
together
with
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
opinions
or
assertions
contained
herein
are
the
private
ones
of
the
writer,
and
are
not
to
be
construed
as
official
or
reflecting
the
views
of
the
navy
department
or
the
naval
service
at
large.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
to
these
early
ones,
that
was
not
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
now
under
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
noticed
another
one,
“immediately
upon
the
acceptance
of
such
articles
for
publication,
the
writer
so
forward
the
complete
copy
of
such
articles
to
the
secretary
of
the
navy
for
the
files
of
the
navy
department,”
that
follows
the
sentence
i
just
read.
was
that
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
