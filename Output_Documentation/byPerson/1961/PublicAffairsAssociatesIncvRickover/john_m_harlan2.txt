justice
john
m.
harlan
your
quarrel
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
stage
of
the
case;
one
fact
do
you
think
they
drew
the
wrong
conclusions
from
the
facts
or
they
followed
a
wrong
standard
what
is
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
what
perspectives
that
they
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
if
he'd
received
an
order
to
make
a
speech.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
that
when
admiral
rickover
first
undertook
to
publish
his
own
speeches,
the
government
had
stepped
in
and
said,
“no,
this
is
our
property,”
could
it
have
recovered
--
could
it
be
prevented
rickover
from
publishing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
what
i'm
getting
at,
the
statute,
section
8
of
the
copyright
act
does
not
destroy
the
government's
common
law
rights
in
unpublished
material.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
the
government
has
never
done
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
standing
have
you
got
then
to
complain
to
the
government
itself
and
unless
it
has
forfeited
those
rights?
justice
john
m.
harlan
joint
participant
of
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
first
amendment
got
to
do
with
this
if
this
is
copyrighted,
why
the
first
amendment
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
if
it
isn't
copyrighted,
the
first
amendment
is
equally
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
go
back
to
one
thing
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
a
moment?
as
i
understand
it,
you
would
recognize
that
the
copyright
act
is
not
destroyed
in
the
government's
common
law
rights
in
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
but
you
affirm
that.
now,
what
i
want
ask
you
is,
has
the
government
as
distinguished
from
rickover,
done
anything
to
lose
its
common
law
rights?
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
they
have
the
right
to
get
the
property
back
in
your
hypothesis
from
rickover.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
this,
i
--
the
first
part,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
scrap
between
or
should
be
a
scrap
between
the
government
and
rickover
and
you
say
you
come
into
the
thing
because
the
government
by
failing
to
assert
its
rights
against
rickover
raises
a
new
--
a
--
raises
a
violation
so
to
speak
for
you
of
a
constituted
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
that
your
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
i
thought
you
agreed
with
me
that
the
government
has
done
nothing
here
in
the
way
of
publication
that
divested
of
its
own
common
law
of
rights
in
this
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
so
there's
been
no
publication
then.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
your
position
comes
down
to
in
a
simple
form
is
that
by
failure
to
act,
the
government
in
effect
in
violation
of
section
8
has
conferred
copyright
rights
on
rickover?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
essence
of
your
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
constitutional
position
is
a
fortiori
so
to
speak?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
preclude
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
oh,
pardon
me
if
i'm
interrupting
you.
what
i
want
to
ask
you,
is
the
government
given
an
opportunity
to
come
in
to
this
lawsuit?
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright,
i
suppose
the
government,
since
you've
given
them
notice,
that
they
thought
they
had
an
interest,
they
could
have
come
in
and
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
wouldn't
need
any
arguing
from
us.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
isn't
that
open
for
further
exploration
under
the
court
of
appeals
remand
in
the
district
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
as
a
matter
of
law
reverse
as
i
understand
it,
the
district
court
on
dedication.
in
other
words,
it
simply
says
that
it
was
wrong
and
holding
as
it
did
and
then
they
send
it
back
for
a
full
exploration
of
the
facts,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they
reversed
--
yes
in
the
sense
that
the
–-
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
as
to
the
scope
of
dedication,
that's
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at,
the
court
of
appeals
left
that
open
on
remand,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
date
on
which
that
procedure
was
(inaudible)
